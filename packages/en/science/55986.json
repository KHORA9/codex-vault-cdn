The greater part of the immense mass\r\nof letters he wrote was necessarily purely scientific, uninteresting\r\nexcept to the person addressed; so that many of those published are\r\nmerely fragments, and very few are given completely. I have made no\r\nattempt to estimate his scientific or critical labors, for they are\r\nsufficiently before the world in various printed works; but something of\r\nthe personality of the man and his many interests may be learned from\r\nthese familiar letters and from even the slight notes.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray began an Autobiography, but went no further than to give a\r\nbrief sketch of his early life. This fragment is placed, with some notes\r\nillustrative of the early conditions in which his youth was passed, at\r\nthe beginning of the work.\r\n\r\nIt is owing to the kind assistance of many friends that the\r\nAutobiography and Letters are thus presented; among whom should be\r\nespecially mentioned Professors C. S. Sargent and Charles L. Jackson,\r\nDr. W. G. Farlow, Mr. J. H. Redfield, and Mr. Horace E. Scudder.\r\n\r\nJ. L.

They had ten children;\r\nthe eighth was Moses Wiley Gray, my grandfather, born in Worcester,\r\nDecember 31, 1745. About the year 1769, he married Sally Miller,\r\ndaughter of Samuel and Elisabeth (Hammond) Miller, of Worcester, and\r\nremoved to Templeton, Mass. About 1787 he removed to Grafton, Vermont,\r\nwhere his wife died in 1793. In 1794 he removed to Oneida County, N. Y.,\r\nand settled in the Sauquoit Valley,[3] where he died from injuries\r\nreceived from the fall of a tree, May 8, 1803.\r\n\r\nMy father, Moses Gray, was the youngest of the (eight?) children of his\r\nmother. There were three half-brothers and a half-sister by a second\r\nwife, born in Oneida County, none of whom survived my father. He was\r\nborn in Templeton, Mass., February 26, 1786.[4] He was therefore in his\r\neighteenth year when his father died. He used to say that he had only\r\nsix weeks of schooling; whether before or after his father’s death I am\r\nignorant. But soon after that event he was apprenticed to a tanner and\r\ncurrier (Mr. Gier) at Sauquoit, in whose employment he must have been\r\nfor a part of the time after he came of age, for I was born in a little\r\nhouse which had been a shoe-shop on the premises of the tan-yard.\r\n\r\nThe fact of being born supposes a maternal ancestry. July 30, 1809, my\r\nfather married Roxana Howard. She was born in Longmeadow, Mass., March\r\n15, 1789; was a daughter of Joseph Howard, who was born in Pomfret,\r\nConn., March 8, 1766, and of Submit (Luce) Howard, born at Somers,\r\nConn., April 3, 1767;[5] and he was the grandson of John Howard of\r\nIpswich,[6] Mass., and of Elisabeth Smith, of the same town. He was the\r\ndescendant of Thomas Howard, who, with his wife and children, came from\r\nAylesford (or Maidstone), Kent, in the year 1634.\r\n\r\nMy mother came with her parents to Oneida County and the Sauquoit Valley\r\nwhen only a few years old.[7] Her father there joined a company which\r\nset up an iron-forge. One of the early pieces of work of its trip-hammer\r\nwas to forge off three of my maternal grandfather’s fingers. This\r\nappears to have qualified him to be the cleric in charge, or manager, of\r\nthe office and store of the Paris Furnace Company, which established a\r\nsmall iron-smelting furnace on the Sauquoit, two and a half miles above\r\nthe village of Sauquoit, in a deep and narrow valley which had the name\r\nof Paris Furnace Hollow, now called Clayville, the furnace long since\r\nhaving disappeared, a natural consequence of the exhaustion of the\r\ncharcoal furnished by the woods of the surrounding hills. My earliest\r\nrecollections are of Paris Furnace Hollow, for not long after I was\r\nborn, as aforesaid, in Sauquoit, on the eastern or Methodist side of the\r\ncreek, on the 18th of November, 1810, my father and mother removed to\r\nParis Furnace with me, their first-born, and set up a small tannery\r\nthere. Of this I retain some vivid recollections, especially those\r\nconnected with the first use to which I was put, the driving round the\r\nring of the old horse which turned the bark-mill, and the supplying the\r\nsaid mill with its grist of bark,--a lonely and monotonous\r\noccupation.[8] I was sent to the district school near by when three\r\nyears old; and I either remember some of my performances of that or the\r\nnext year, or have been told them in such way as to leave the matter\r\ndoubtful.[9] My earliest distinct recollections of school are of\r\nspelling-matches, in which at six or seven years I was a champion.[10]\r\nThere was a year or two of early boyhood in which I was sent to a small\r\n“select” or private school, taught at Sauquoit, by the son of the pastor\r\nof the parish; a year or two following, in which I was in my maternal\r\ngrandfather’s family, near by, as a sort of office-boy; and at the age\r\nof twelve, or near it, I was sent off to the Clinton Grammar School,\r\nnine miles away, where I was drilled after a fashion in the rudiments of\r\nLatin and Greek for two years, excepting the three summer months, when\r\nI was taken home to assist in the corn and hayfield. For my father,\r\nbuying up, little by little, lands which had been cleared for charcoal,\r\nhad become a farmer in a small way, an occupation to which he was most\r\ninclined. So about these times he sold out the tannery and bought a\r\nsmall farm nearer to Sauquoit, mainly of the land which my maternal\r\ngrandfather had settled on, including the house in which he had married\r\nmy mother. To it he removed, and there resided until he bought out an\r\nadjacent small farm in addition, with an old house very pleasantly\r\nsituated, which he rebuilt and lived in until after I had attained my\r\nmajority. But soon after that he bought a small farm close to the\r\nSauquoit village on the western or Presbyterian side, hard by the\r\nmeeting-house the family had always attended. There my father indulged\r\nhis special fancy by rebuilding another old house, and the place, after\r\nhis death, and, much later, after that of my mother, fell to my eldest\r\nbrother, who still possesses it.[11]\r\n\r\nI am not sure, but I think it was after two years of the Clinton Grammar\r\nSchool that I was transferred to Fairfield Academy.[12] Fairfield,\r\nHerkimer County, lies high on the hills, between the West and East\r\nCanada creeks, seven miles north of Little Falls. I went there first in\r\nOctober, 1825, the date I fix by that of the completion of the Erie\r\nCanal. For that autumn, I think in November, I walked one afternoon,\r\nalong with some other students, down to Little Falls to see there the\r\narrival of the canal-boat which bore the canal-commissioners, with the\r\ngovernor, De Witt Clinton at their head, on their ceremonious voyage\r\nfrom Buffalo to New York city. It reached Little Falls near sunset, and\r\nwe walked to Fairfield that evening. The reason for my being sent to\r\nFairfield Academy was that the principal of the academy was Charles\r\nAvery, uncle of my companion from infancy, Eli Avery, of our town, who\r\ndied two years ago, who had been educated by the help of Eli’s father,\r\nColonel Avery, one of the owners of Paris furnace. Charles Avery several\r\nyears later took the professorship of chemistry, etc., at Hamilton\r\nCollege, lived to over ninety, I think, and through all his later years\r\nseemed to be very proud of having been my teacher. I cannot say that I\r\nowe much to him, even for teaching me mathematics, which was his forte.\r\nMy capital memory allowed me to “get my lessons” easily, and that\r\nsufficed; and I had none of the sharp drilling and testing which I\r\nneeded. He lingers in my memory in another way. He was sharp at turning\r\na penny in various ways; among them, he for the first year and more\r\njobbed the board of his nephew Eli and myself, who were chums, paying\r\nfor it in cooking-stoves and the like from Paris furnace, in which\r\nthrough his brother he had an interest, and boarding us round, from one\r\nhouse to another (we had our room in the academy buildings) until the\r\nstove which cooked our dinner was paid for. Sometimes our fare was good\r\nenough; but one poor widow, who took us in her turn, fed us so much upon\r\nboiled salt cod, not always of the sweetest, that the sight of that dish\r\nstill calls up ancient memories not altogether agreeable. I think it was\r\nnot at that time, but at a somewhat later date, and with less excuse,\r\nthat we mended our diet upon one occasion, one winter’s night, by\r\ncarrying off the principal’s best fowls from the roost, skinning them,\r\nas the most expeditious and neatest way, and broiling them in our room\r\nas the pièce de résistance, for they were tough, in a little supper we\r\ngot up.\r\n\r\nI here recall a favor which Mr. Avery did me. A year or two after I had\r\ntaken my M. D., my dear old friend Professor Hadley, of Fairfield\r\nMedical College, who had been filling the place at Hamilton College pro\r\ntem., made me a candidate for the professorship there of chemistry, with\r\ngeology and natural science. But my old teacher, Mr. Avery, an alumnus\r\nof the college, entered the lists and carried the day. I wonder if I\r\nshould have rusted out there if I had got the place.\r\n\r\nI must go back to say something of my omnivorous reading, which was,\r\nafter all, the larger part of my education. I was a reader almost from\r\nmy cradle, and I read everything I could lay hands on. There was no\r\ngreat choice in my early boyhood. But there was a little subscription\r\nlibrary at Sauquoit, the stockholders of which met four times a year,\r\ndistributed the books by auction to the highest bidder (maximum,\r\nperhaps, ten or twelve cents) to have and to hold for three months; or\r\nif there was no competition each took what he chose. Rather slow\r\ncirculation this; but in the three months the books were thoroughly\r\nread. History I rather took to, but especially voyages and travels were\r\nmy delight. There were no plays, not even Shakespeare in the library,\r\nbut a sprinkling of novels. My novel-reading, up to the time when I was\r\nsent to school at Clinton, was confined, I think, to Miss Porter’s\r\n“Children of the Abbey” and “Thaddeus of Warsaw”--the latter a\r\nsoul-stirring production, of which I can recall a good deal; of the\r\nformer nothing distinctly. One Sunday afternoon, of the first winter I\r\nwas at Clinton, I went into the public room of one of the two village\r\ninns, where half a dozen of the villagers were assembled; and one was\r\nreading aloud “Quentin Durward,” which had just appeared in an American\r\n(Philadelphia) reprint. This was my introduction to the Waverley novels.\r\nThe next summer, when at home for farm work, I found “Rob Roy” in the\r\nlittle library I have mentioned, took it out and read it with interest.\r\nIn the autumn, when I went back to school, some college (Hamilton\r\nCollege) students were boarding at the house where I boarded and lodged.\r\nOne of them, seeing my avidity for books, introduced me to the librarian\r\nof the Phœnix Society of the college, which had a library strong in\r\nnovels, which I was allowed, one by one, to take home for reading. I\r\nsuppose that I read them every one.[13]\r\n\r\nIt was intended that I should go to college, and my father could have\r\nput me through without serious inconvenience; but he was buying land\r\nabout this time, and he persuaded me to give up that idea and to go at\r\nonce at the study of medicine, which I did, in the autumn of 1826,\r\nbeginning with the session of 1826-27 in the medical college (of the\r\nwestern district), then a flourishing country medical school at\r\nFairfield. I had already attended its courses in chemistry, given by\r\nProfessor James Hadley (father of Professor James Hadley of Yale\r\nCollege, then a lad), my earliest scientific adviser and most excellent\r\nfriend. I had a passion for mineralogy in those days, as well as for\r\nchemistry. The spring and summer of 1827 I passed in the office of one\r\nof the village doctors of Sauquoit, Dr. Priest, and on the opening of\r\nthe autumn session returned to the medical school at Fairfield. That\r\nyear, in the course of the winter, I picked up and read the article\r\n“Botany” in Brewster’s “Edinburgh Encyclopædia,” a poor thing, no doubt,\r\nbut it interested me much. I bought Eaton’s “Manual of Botany,”[15]\r\npored over its pages, and waited for spring. Before the spring opened,\r\nthe short college session being over, I became a medical student, after\r\nthe country fashion, in the office of Dr. John F. Trowbridge of\r\nBridgewater, Oneida County, nine miles south of my paternal home;\r\ncontinued there for three years, except during the college sessions,\r\nwhere I attended four annual courses before taking my degree of M. D. at\r\nthe close of the session of 1829-30.[16] The fact will appear, which I\r\ndid not reveal at the time, that I took this degree six or seven months\r\n(I passed my examination, indeed, eight or nine months) before I had\r\nattained the legal age of twenty-one. But I looked older, and was in\r\nfact such an old stager in the school that no one thought of asking if I\r\nwas of age. That degree gives me my place high enough on the Harvard\r\nUniversity list to entitle me to a free dinner at Commencement.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned my interest in botany as beginning in the winter and\r\nout of all reach either of a greenhouse or of a potted plant. But in the\r\nspring, I think that of 1828, I sallied forth one April day into the\r\nbare woods, found an early specimen of a plant in flower, peeping\r\nthrough dead leaves, brought it home, and with Eaton’s “Manual” without\r\nmuch difficulty I ran it down to its name, Claytonia Virginica. (It was\r\nreally C. Caroliniana, but the two were not distinguished in that book.)\r\nI was well pleased, and went on, collecting and examining all the\r\nflowers I could lay hands on; and the rides over the country to visit\r\npatients along with my preceptor, Dr. Trowbridge, gave good\r\nopportunities. I began an herbarium of shockingly bad specimens. In\r\nautumn, going back to Fairfield for the annual course of medical\r\nlectures, I took specimens of those plants that puzzled me to Professor\r\nHadley, who had learned some botany of Dr. Ives of New Haven, and had\r\nmade a neat herbarium of the common New England and New York plants,\r\nwhich I studied carefully that winter. At Professor Hadley’s suggestion\r\nI opened a correspondence with Dr. Lewis C. Beck of Albany,[17] who was\r\nthe botanist of the region. The next summer I collected more easily and\r\ncritically. The summer after, I think, or probably the summer of 1830, I\r\nhad an opportunity to make a little run to New York, being sent by Dr.\r\nTrowbridge to buy some medical books, driving in a one-horse wagon, with\r\nmy own horse, ninety miles to Albany, thence by steamer to New York over\r\nnight; one night there, and back next day by boat to Albany, and so\r\ndriving back to Bridgewater in company with a man of business who joined\r\nme in this little expedition. I stopped to see Lewis C. Beck at Albany\r\nAcademy; there I first saw a grave-looking man who I was told was\r\nProfessor Henry, who had just been making a wonderful electro-magnet. I\r\nhad procured from Professor Hadley a letter of introduction to Dr.\r\nTorrey, whose “Flora of the Northern United States,” vol. i., was our\r\ngreatest help so far as it went, and which on that journey I bought a\r\ncopy of. I took also a parcel of plants to be named. Finding my way to\r\nDr. Torrey’s house in Charlton Street with my parcel and letter, I had\r\nthe disappointment of finding that he was away at Williamstown,\r\nMassachusetts, for the summer. It was not until the next winter that at\r\nFairfield I received a letter from Dr. Torrey, naming my plants, and\r\ninviting the correspondence which continued thence to the end of his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Dr. Hadley’s summer course of lectures on chemistry, Dr.\r\nLewis C. Beck used to come and deliver a short course of lectures on\r\nbotany. He gave this up the year in which I received my M. D., so\r\nProfessor Hadley invited me to come and give the course instead. The\r\ncourse was given in five or six weeks, beginning in the latter part of\r\nMay. I prepared myself during the winter, gave this my first course of\r\nlectures, cleared forty dollars by the operation, and devoted it to the\r\nmaking of a tour to the western part of the State of New York, as far as\r\nNiagara Falls, Buffalo, and Aurora,--a dozen or more miles off,--where I\r\nvisited an uncle, my mother’s brother, a well-to-do country merchant,\r\nalso a chum, Dr. Folwell, in Seneca County, high up between the two\r\nlakes, where I passed a week or two; thence to Ithaca, and across the\r\ncountry by a stage-coach back to Bridgewater. I hardly know what I did\r\nthe next autumn and winter, but in early spring a Mr. Edgerton, a pupil\r\nof Amos Eaton, at Troy, the professor of natural sciences at the\r\nflourishing school of Mr. Bartlett at Utica, died. I applied for the\r\nvacancy, received the appointment, and for two or part of three years,\r\nminus a long summer vacation, I taught chemistry, geology, mineralogy,\r\nand botany, to boys, making with the boys very pleasant botanical\r\nexcursions through the country round. My first summer vacation, if I\r\nrightly remember, was in cholera year, the disease being very fatal in\r\nUtica. About the time it made its appearance in New York I started off\r\nfrom Bridgewater, taking a little country stage-coach down the Unadilla\r\nto Pennsylvania; visited Carbondale and made a collection of calamites\r\nand fossil ferns; thence by stage-coach through the Wind Gap to Easton;\r\nthence out to Bethlehem, where I passed a day with old Bishop\r\nSchweinitz,[18] gave him a Carex which he said was new, but I told him\r\nit was Carex livida, Wahl. (and I was right); back to Easton; thence up\r\nto Sussex County, N. J., collecting minerals (Franklinite, etc.); thence\r\nto adjacent Orange County, N. Y., collecting spinelles, etc., as well as\r\nbotanizing; thence down to New York early in September; there I met Dr.\r\nTorrey for the first time, and we took a little expedition together down\r\nto Tom’s River in the pine barrens, and back to New York in a\r\nwood-sloop.\r\n\r\nThe next year, in the spring, Dr. Torrey went to Europe, sent to\r\npurchase apparatus for the New York City University, then just\r\nestablished. He engaged me to go that summer to collect plants in the\r\npine barrens of New Jersey, he to take the half of my collection, paying\r\nwhat would be required to defray my very moderate expenses in the field.\r\nI found afterwards that these plants went to B. D. Greene and his\r\nbrother Copley, then abroad and full of botany; and I have encountered\r\nthem, _i. e._, the specimens, in various places, especially in Herb. De\r\nCandolle, as “Coll. Greene.” I got down, I hardly now know how, to\r\nTuckerton on the Jersey coast, botanized at Little Egg Harbor, Wading\r\nRiver, Quaker Bridge, and Atsion. While at Quaker Bridge my loneliness\r\nwas cheered by the appearance of a fine-looking man, who came in a\r\nchaise, looking after some particular insect. It proved to be Major Le\r\nConte.[19]\r\n\r\nThe next winter at Bartlett’s school. In the spring went north to\r\nWatertown; visited Dr. Crawe, botanized on Black River, made\r\nmineralogical excursions, and back to Utica via Sackett’s Harbor (lake\r\nto Oswego, and canal to Utica). After the spring term of school there--I\r\nthink it was that year, but am uncertain--I took through the summer\r\nProfessor Hadley’s place at Hamilton College, Clinton; gave for him a\r\ncourse of instruction in botany and mineralogy. This, I have reason to\r\nthink, was a ruse of my good friend, who wished me to succeed to that\r\nprofessorship, which he was on the point of resigning. Fortunately,\r\nCharles Avery, my old academic preceptor, became a candidate and secured\r\nthe election.\r\n\r\nThese years are a good deal mixed up, and I cannot settle their dates\r\nnor the order of events. Only I know that the next autumn I got a\r\nfurlough from the school until toward the end of winter, that I might\r\naccept Dr. Torrey’s invitation to be his assistant during his course of\r\nchemical lectures in the Medical School, and at his house in the\r\nherbarium, living with him, and receiving eighty dollars as pay. This I\r\ncan fix as the winter of 1833-34 or 1834-35. The first century of my\r\n“North American Gramineæ and Cyperaceæ” was got out that winter, and it\r\nbears the date of 1834.[20] In February or March I went up by stagecoach\r\nfrom New York to Albany, thence to Bridgewater, and so to Utica, to do\r\nmy work at Bartlett’s school. That finished, made a second trip to the\r\nnortheast part of the State, collecting in botany and mineralogy with\r\nDr. Crawe, extending the tour to St. Lawrence County, where we found\r\nfine fluor-spar and great but rough crystals of phosphate of lime,\r\nidiocrase, etc. I wrote some account of these for the “American Journal\r\nof Science,” the earliest of my many contributions to that journal.\r\nReturning toward autumn to Bridgewater, I there received a letter from\r\nDr. Torrey, informing me that the prospects of the Medical College were\r\nso poor that he could not longer afford to have my services as\r\nassistant. Bartlett’s school I had resigned from on account of my\r\nprospects in New York. And, in fact, the school was then going down, and\r\nhe [Bartlett] was transferred soon after to Poughkeepsie, where he\r\nflourished anew for a time. I was in a rather bad way. But I determined\r\nto go to New York, assisted Dr. Torrey as I could, got out the second\r\npart of my “North American Gramineæ and Cyperaceæ.” I am not sure\r\nwhether I was in Dr. Torrey’s family or not, or for only a part of the\r\nwinter. But in the spring of 1835, I went up to my father’s house for\r\nthe summer, with some books, among them a copy of De Candolle’s\r\n“Organographie” and “Théorie Elémentaire.” These or at least the former\r\ncame from Professor Lehmann,[21] of Hamburg, with whom for a year or two\r\nI had corresponded and exchanged plants, or received books in exchange\r\nfor plants. I had made a still earlier exchange with Soleirol, a French\r\narmy surgeon, who had collected in Corsica. While at home I blocked out\r\nand partly wrote my “Elements of Botany.” Returned to New York in the\r\nautumn; went into cheap lodgings, arranged with Carvill & Company to\r\ntake my book. I think they gave one hundred and fifty dollars, which was\r\na great sum for me. We got it through the press that winter. John Carey\r\nhad then come down to New York, and was a great help to me in\r\nproof-reading, and the little book was published in April or May, 1836.\r\n\r\nI think it was in the autumn of 1836 that the Lyceum of Natural History,\r\nNew York, having with a great effort erected their hall, on Broadway\r\njust below Prince Street, I was appointed curator; had a room for my\r\nuse, some light pay, proportioned to light duties, and this was my home\r\nfor a year or two. There I wrote my papers, “Remarks on the Structure\r\nand Affinities of the Ceratophyllaceæ” (which dates February 20,\r\n1837),--not a very wise production, and some of the observations are\r\nincorrect; also the better paper, really rather good, “Melanthacearum\r\nAmericæ Septentrionalis Revisio,” published in 1837.\r\n\r\nDr. Torrey had planned the “Flora of North America,” but had not made\r\nmuch solid progress in it. I, having time on my hands, took hold to work\r\nup in a preliminary way some of the earlier orders for his use. This was\r\nto pass the time for a while, for in the summer of 1836 I was appointed\r\nbotanist to a great South Pacific exploring expedition, which met with\r\nall manner of delays in fitting out, changes in commanders, etc., until\r\nfinally, in the spring of 1838, Lieutenant Wilkes was appointed to the\r\ncommand, the number and size of the vessels cut down, and the scientific\r\ncorps more or less diminished. The assistant botanist, William Rich, an\r\nappointment of the Secretary of the Navy, was to be left out. I resigned\r\nin his favor, having been about that time appointed professor of natural\r\nhistory in the newly chartered University of Michigan. As I had thus far\r\ndone fully half the work, Dr. Torrey invited me to be joint author in\r\n“Flora of North America.” The first part was printed and issued in July,\r\nthe second in October, 1838, at our joint expense, my share being\r\ncontributed from the pay I had been receiving while waiting orders as\r\nbotanist of the exploring expedition.\r\n\r\nBy this time we had come to see that we did not know enough of the\r\noriginal sources to work up the North American flora properly, and as\r\nDr. Torrey could not get away from home, I was determined to get abroad\r\nand consult some of the principal herbaria. On being appointed professor\r\nin the University of Michigan, which had as yet no buildings, I made it\r\nunderstood that I must have a year abroad. The trustees of the\r\nuniversity in this view gave me, in the autumn of 1838, a year’s leave\r\nof absence, a salary for that year of fifteen hundred dollars, and put\r\ninto my hands five thousand dollars with which to lay a foundation for\r\ntheir general library. I sailed early in November, 1838, in the\r\npacket-ship Philadelphia, for Liverpool; went direct from Liverpool to\r\nGlasgow; was guest of Dr. William J. Hooker till Christmas--his son,\r\nJoseph D. Hooker, was then a medical student; went to Arlary, December\r\n26-7, to visit Arnott; stayed till the day after New Year; thence to\r\nEdinburgh for two or three days. Greville was the best botanist, but\r\nGraham was the professor, Balfour then a young botanist there. Heard old\r\nMonro, Wilson (Christopher North), Chalmers, Traill, Charles Bell, etc.,\r\nlecture. On way south stopped at Melrose and Abbotsford; coach to\r\nNewcastle, Durham (over Sunday), and through Manchester, where rail was\r\ntaken, to Birmingham and London. Took lodgings till some time in March.\r\nDr. Boott was of course my best friend there. But Hooker and Joseph came\r\nup to London for a week. Hooker insisted on taking me in hand as of his\r\nparty, and so I was introduced to all his friends; took me to the Royal\r\nSociety, etc.; dined one day with Bentham, to whose house I often went,\r\nand who gave me a full supply of letters to the botanists on the\r\nContinent. I worked a good deal at the British Museum; Robert Brown was\r\nvery kind to me, and his assistant, J. J. Bennett, very useful, putting\r\nme up to all the old collections and how to consult them. At Linnæan\r\nSociety, thanks to Boott, had every facility for the Linnæan herbarium.\r\nOld Lambert too; he had the Hookers and myself at dinner, and gave me as\r\ngood opportunity as he could to consult the Pursh plants, etc., in his\r\nherbarium, which, not long after, was scattered, but it was in his\r\ndining-room, which was very much lumbered, and to be reached only at\r\ncertain hours. Lindley had me down for a day to his house at Turnham\r\nGreen, and a little dinner at the close. First visited Kew with the\r\nHookers; called on Francis Bauer, who lived in a house near the river;\r\nfound him at ninety making beautiful microscopic drawings to illustrate\r\nthe genera of ferns; and Hooker then arranged for their publication in\r\nthe well-known volume for which he furnished the text. Saw not rarely N.\r\nB. Ward, who lived at Wellclose Square in Wapping, and whose cultivation\r\nof plants in closed cases attracted much attention. Went with Ward one\r\nday to dine with Menzies, then over ninety; he lived, with a\r\nhousekeeper, at Maida Vale, or somewhere beyond Kensington.\r\n\r\nGeorge P. Putnam, of the firm of Wiley & Putnam, was then resident in\r\nLondon, and through him I managed the expenditure of the money placed in\r\nmy hands for the purchase of books for the University of Michigan, in a\r\nmanner that proved satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThere is still in my possession, but not in reach for ready reference, a\r\nfile of letters which I wrote home to the Torrey family while I was in\r\nEurope. If I were to find them and refresh my memory by them, I should\r\nmake these notes quite too long. I will therefore trust to memory and\r\ntouch lightly here and there on my Continental journey. I think it was\r\nearly in March, 1839, that one morning I took passage on a small steamer\r\nfrom London, Bentham coming to see me off, to Calais; thence diligence\r\nfor Paris. My lodgings, near the Luxembourg, were not far from the house\r\nof P. Barker Webb, to whom I had introductions, and who was very useful\r\nto me; he owned the herbarium of Desfontaines. At the Jardin des Plantes\r\nwere old Mirbel, who occupied himself only with vegetable anatomy,\r\nAdrien Jussieu, with whom I corresponded as long as he lived,\r\nBrongniart, Decaisne, then aide-naturaliste, and Spach, curator of the\r\nherbarium. Jussieu had his father’s herbarium in his study. Besides\r\nMichaux’s herbarium at the Jardin des Plantes, I had also to consult,\r\nfor a few things, the set taken by the actual writer of the “Flora,” L.\r\nC. Richard. This I found at the house of his son Achille Richard,\r\nbotanical professor in the Medical School, living in the Medical Botanic\r\nGarden, then occupying a piece of the Luxembourg grounds. The other\r\nFrench botanists I recall were Dr. Montagne, the cryptogamist, a\r\npleasant man, Gaudichaud, whom I saw little of, Auguste St. Hilaire, who\r\nI think spent only the winter in Paris. I had an introduction to\r\nBenjamin Delessert, who lived in fine style in a hotel in the Rue\r\nMontmartre. Lasègue, the librarian, acted as curator to the herbarium\r\n(Guillemin had died not long before), which I found occasion to consult\r\nonly once. I should not forget Jacques Gay, with his large herbarium\r\nvery rich in European plants. I never dreamed then that so many of them\r\nwould find their way into our own herbarium. He lived close to the\r\nLuxembourg Palace, then the palace of the House of Peers. Gay was the\r\nsecretary of the Marquis de Semonville, who was a high official there,\r\nand so lived near by. He held a weekly reception for botanists, etc.,\r\nand was a good soul. It was at the herbarium of the Jardin des Plantes\r\nthat I first made the acquaintance of a botanist of about my own age,\r\nEdmond Boissier of Geneva, who was studying some of the plants of his\r\ncollections in Granada and other parts of Spain, soon after brought out\r\nin his work on the “Flora of Granada,” etc.\r\n\r\nI left Paris in early spring, by malle-poste to Lyons; passed a day with\r\nSeringe; steamer to Avignon, diligence to Nîmes, and thence to\r\nMontpellier, where I passed two or three days. Delile and Dunal were the\r\nprofessors; saw Bentham’s mother and sister, then resident there.\r\nDiligence to Marseilles, steamer to Genoa, Leghorn, a day at each; to\r\nCivita Vecchia; a carriage to Rome, along with an English clergyman;\r\nthence back same way to Leghorn, Pisa, Florence. Vetturino to Bologna,\r\nFerrara, Padua (Visiani at the garden), Venice; then steamer to Trieste;\r\na day with Biasoletto, including a botanical excursion, and Tommasini.\r\nFell in there with a young artist of New York, whose name I have\r\nforgotten. We took places in the malle-poste together to Vienna, but\r\nwent on two days ahead to Adelsberg; visited the grotto on a fête day\r\nwhen it was all lighted, and all the country people there in gala trim;\r\nthat night went on by malle-poste. At Vienna, Endlicher, and his\r\nassistant Fenzl, but the latter laid up with lame knee. Never saw him\r\nafterward, but we had a long correspondence. Steamer up the Danube to\r\nLinz, tramway, etc., to the Gmunden See, and so to Ischl; climbed the\r\nZeimitz, all alone, picked my first Alpine flowers; traveled over night\r\nto Salzburg, then to Munich; fine times with Martius and Zuccarini,\r\njoined the celebration out in the country of Linnæus’ birthday,--but not\r\nthe 24th May; I think two or three weeks later. From Munich to Lindau on\r\nLake Constance; thence to Zurich; up the lake to Horgen; walked over to\r\nArt; walked up the Rigi; descended the Rigi to take the boat up the\r\nlake, missed it, got a man to put me across in Canton Unterwalden;\r\nwalked to Stanz, slept, walked next morning to Engelberg, and then over\r\nthe [Joch?] Pass, and down to Meyringen; next day to Interlaken and the\r\nStaubbach, next over the Wengern Alp to Grindelwald, next over the Grand\r\nScheideck to valley of Hassli, up to the Grimsel, passed a Sunday in the\r\nsnow; walked down to the Rhone glacier and down to Brieg; thence partly\r\non foot, partly char-à-banc, to Martigny; made excursion to the Col de\r\nBalme to get a good view of Mont Blanc; back to Martigny, down to\r\nVilleneuve, and steamer to Geneva. I reached there, I think, July 4;\r\nworked there ten days or so, very sharp; De Candolle, father and son,\r\nand Reuter[22] the curator; saw again Boissier. Leaving boat at\r\nLausanne, diligence to Freiburg, Berne, Bâle. Got across country, I\r\nhardly remember how, to Tübingen, Stuttgart, Heidelberg, Frankfort;\r\nthence to Leipzig; made excursion to Dresden, then to Halle, where was\r\nSchlechtendal, and where I looked over old Schkuhr’s originals of his\r\nCarex plates; thence through Wittenberg to Potsdam and Berlin; worked\r\ndiligently a week in herbarium. Willdenow, Klotzsch the curator; saw old\r\nLink, Kunth, and Ehrenberg. Diligence to Hamburg, where was Lehmann, one\r\nof my very earliest correspondents. Steamer from Hamburg to London, late\r\nin September. Toward the middle of October went to Portsmouth, and came\r\nback to New York in a London packet-ship. Steamers were then only just\r\nbeginning to make regular trips.\r\n\r\nReturning, Michigan University was quite ready to give me a furlough of\r\na year or two, without pay; took hold sharp of “Flora of North America,”\r\nand in beginning of next summer (June, 1840) we issued the parts 3 and 4\r\nof vol. i. Then went at the “Compositæ;” was interrupted a while in\r\nsummer of 1841, when I went with John Carey, and James Constable for a\r\npart of the time, on a botanical trip up the Valley of Virginia to the\r\nmountains of North Carolina, getting as far as to Grandfather and Roan.\r\n\r\nIt was, I think, in the spring of 1841 that the first part of the\r\n“Compositæ” was published, _i. e._, vol. ii. pp. 1-184; the second part,\r\nto p. 400, was out the next spring. Sometime in January, 1842, I made a\r\nvisit of two or three days to B. D. Greene in Boston; the first time I\r\never saw Boston. Came out one day to Cambridge, dined with his\r\nfather-in-law, President Quincy; the company to meet us was Professor\r\nChanning[23] and Professor Treadwell.[24] Sometime in April, I received\r\na letter from President Quincy, telling me that the Corporation of the\r\nuniversity would elect me Fisher professor of natural history if I would\r\nbeforehand signify my acceptance. The endowment then yielded fifteen\r\nhundred dollars a year. I was to have a thousand and allow the rest to\r\naccumulate for a while. Meanwhile I was to give only a course of\r\nbotanical lectures, in the second spring term, and look after the\r\nGarden. But more work was soon added. I came in July, in the midst of\r\nvacation, before Commencement, which was then in September; got\r\nlodgings, with room for my then small herbarium, in the house of Deacon\r\nMunroe. Went late in September on an excursion to Mount Washington, by\r\nway of the Notch, along with Tuckerman, then living at his father’s in\r\nBoston. Worked away at “Compositæ,” and in the winter went to New York\r\nand carried the remainder through the press. it was issued in February,\r\n1843.\r\n\r\nI must not forget that my little “Elements of Botany” had been sold out,\r\nand the publishers, Carvill, had gone out of business or died. I\r\nprepared in 1841-42 the first edition of my “Botanical Text-Book;” it\r\nwas in the course of printing when I was appointed to the Fisher\r\nprofessorship, so that I could put that title on the title-page, and\r\nhave a text-book for my class.\r\n\r\nMy first session of college work was over about July 1, 1843. The\r\ntreasurer, Mr. Samuel Eliot, had given me leave to spend a small sum in\r\nreplenishing the Botanic Garden. I met my friend and correspondent,\r\nWilliam S. Sullivant, who had taken strongly to mosses, early in August,\r\non the Alleghanies beyond Frostburg, Maryland (the railroad went only to\r\nCumberland), he coming from Columbus, Ohio, I from Cambridge. There we\r\nbought a span of horses and a strong country wagon, and set out on the\r\nmountain expedition, some sketch of which is given in the “American\r\nJournal of Science” for January, 1846. (The first journey is more\r\nparticularly detailed in the “American Journal of Science,” xlii., no.\r\n1; 1842?) When Sullivant left me, at Warm Springs on the French Broad,\r\nanxious to get home, I was left in a pretty lonely condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEARLY UNDERTAKINGS.\r\n\r\n1831-1838.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Gray’s autobiographical fragment closes abruptly, and is valuable\r\nchiefly for the glimpse which it gives of his ancestry and his boyhood.\r\nHe kept no diary, but he carried on a voluminous correspondence, and his\r\nletters thus contain a record of his hard-working, eager life. The\r\nearliest tell of the struggle for position, his doubts if his loved\r\nscience could furnish him a maintenance, and his resolution to make any\r\nsacrifice if he could devote himself to its study. His wants outside of\r\nappliances for scientific investigation were few, and he had a hopeful\r\ntemper. He said in later life that when he was ready for anything it\r\nalways came to him, and he never dwelt upon the hardships of his early\r\nyears; indeed, he forgot them.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Fairfield Medical College he divided his years between\r\nteaching in Bartlett’s school in Utica (some of his old pupils still\r\nrecall his field excursions with his class, and his eager delight in the\r\nsearch after plants), in journeys botanical and mineralogical, and in\r\nsome shorter and longer stays in New York, where for a good portion of\r\nthe time he was a member of Dr. John Torrey’s family. Dr. Torrey was a\r\nkeen observer, a lively suggester of new theories and explanations,\r\nmost eminently truthful in all inquiries, and a devout Christian. Mrs.\r\nTorrey was a woman of rare character, refined, of intellectual tastes\r\nand cultivation, great independence, extremely benevolent, and with a\r\ncapacity for government and control. She was devotedly religious, not\r\nonly for herself and her own household, but for all who could possibly\r\ncome within her influence. It was a new experience to the country-bred\r\nyoung man, and she saw in him many capabilities of which he was as yet\r\nhimself unconscious. He always said that in his development he owed much\r\nto her in many ways. She criticised and improved his manners, his\r\ntastes, his habits, and especially, together with Dr. Torrey, exercised\r\na strong influence on his religious life. His parents and family were\r\nconscientious, good and faithful church members. But they were not\r\npeople who talked much, and indeed had little direct oversight of their\r\nson after he was fourteen years old, when he left home. He never\r\nreturned to the family roof after that for more than a few months at a\r\ntime, and his youthful surroundings away from home were of very varied\r\ninfluence; some of them, though never vicious, were of a decidedly\r\nirreligious character. When he entered the Torrey family, the difference\r\nin the life, the contrast in the way of meeting trials and sorrows\r\nstruck him forcibly, and the religious side of his nature was roused, a\r\nserious interest awakened, which from that time on made always a strong\r\nand permanent part of his character.\r\n\r\nDr. Torrey saw the ability of the young student, and writing to his\r\nfriend, Professor Henry, in February, 1835, to see if a place could not\r\nbe found for him at Princeton, says:--\r\n\r\n“I wish we could find a place for my friend Gray in the college.... He\r\nhas no superior in botany, considering his age, and any subject that he\r\ntakes up he handles in a masterly manner.... He is an uncommonly fine\r\nfellow, and will make a great noise in the scientific world one of these\r\ndays. It is good policy for the college to secure the services and\r\naffections of young men of talent, and let them grow up with the\r\ninstitution.... He would do great credit to the college; and he will be\r\ncontinually publishing. He has just prepared for publication in the\r\nAnnals of the Lyceum two capital botanical papers.... Gray has a capital\r\nherbarium and collection of minerals. He understands most of the\r\nbranches of natural history well, and in botany he has few superiors.”\r\n\r\nHis friend, Mr. John H. Redfield[25] recalling him in those early days,\r\nwrites:--\r\n\r\n“He had worked with Dr. Torrey in his herbarium in 1834 and in 1835, and\r\nin 1834 read his first paper before the Lyceum, a monograph of the North\r\nAmerican Rhynchosporæ, which is still the best help we have for the\r\nstudy of that genus. His bachelor quarters were in the upper story of\r\nthe building, and there he diligently employed the hours not occupied\r\nwith other duties in studies and dissections, the results of which\r\nappeared in several elaborate contributions to the Annals. Dr. Gray’s\r\nresidence in the building and his position as librarian brought him into\r\nfrequent and pleasant intercourse with the members of the Lyceum, and in\r\nthis way began my own acquaintance with him. The interest which he\r\nalways manifested in making easy the openings to the paths of knowledge\r\nfor the younger men impressed me greatly. In describing his manner I\r\nshould use neither the terms ‘imperious’ or ‘impetuous,’ but\r\nenthusiastic eagerness would better express its characteristic. He had\r\neven then something of that hesitancy of speech which he sometimes\r\nmanifested in later years, a hesitancy which seemed to arise from\r\nthoughts which crowded faster than words could be found for them, and I\r\nassociate his manner of speaking then with a slight swing of the head\r\nfrom side to side, which my recollections of his later manner do not\r\nrecall. In person he was unusually attractive, his face, bright,\r\nanimated and expressive, lit up by eyes beaming with intellect and\r\nkindness.”\r\n\r\nDr. Gray began in 1834 his contributions to the “American Journal of\r\nScience.” His first paper, printed in May, was “A Sketch of the\r\nMineralogy of a Portion of Jefferson and St. Lawrence Counties, N.Y., by\r\nJ.B. Crawe of Watertown, and A. Gray of Utica, N.Y.,”[26] and from that\r\ntime until his death he was a constant contributor of original articles,\r\nreviews, and notices of all botanists whose deaths occurred within his\r\nknowledge, leaving an unfinished necrology on his desk.\r\n\r\nIn 1835 his first text-book was written, “Elements of Botany,” and he\r\nreturned to the same title for his last text-book in 1887. He spent a\r\nsummer at his Sauquoit home at work upon it; and he once gave a lively\r\naccount of the warm and noisy discussions which he held with his friend\r\nJohn Carey over style and expressions when he was reading the proofs in\r\nhis boarding-house in New York, to the great interest of all within\r\nhearing. He admitted that it was one of the best lessons in the art of\r\nwriting he ever had.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray, writing for the “New York World” an obituary notice of John\r\nCarey, on his death in 1880, says of him, after a short sketch of his\r\nlife:--\r\n\r\n“Mr. Carey was a man of marked gifts, accomplishments, and\r\nindividuality. His name will long be remembered in American botany.\r\nThere are few of his contemporaries in this country who have done more\r\nfor it than he, although he took little part in independent publication.\r\nHis critical knowledge and taste and his keen insight were most useful\r\nto me in my earlier days of botanical authorship. He wrote several\r\nvaluable articles for the journals, and when, in 1848, my ‘Manual of\r\nBotany’ was produced, he contributed to it the two most difficult\r\narticles, that on the willows and that on the sedges....\r\n\r\n“Being fondly attached to his memory, and almost the last survivor of\r\nthe notable scientific circle which Mr. Carey adorned, I wish to pay\r\nthis feeble tribute to the memory of a worthy botanist and a most\r\ngenial, true-hearted, and good man.”\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that Dr. Gray’s letters to his old friend are no\r\nlonger in existence.\r\n\r\nHis correspondence with Sir William Jackson Hooker, then professor at\r\nGlasgow, Scotland, began in 1835.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nBRIDGEWATER, ONEIDA COUNTY, N.Y., January 1, 1831.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received your letter, through Professor Hadley, a few weeks\r\nsince, and I embrace the earliest opportunity of transmitting a few\r\nspecimens of those plants of which you wished a further supply. I\r\nregret that the state of my herbarium will not admit of my sending as\r\nmany specimens of each as I could wish or as would be desirable to you.\r\nI shall be able to obtain an additional supply of most of them during\r\nthe ensuing summer, when it will give me pleasure to supply you with\r\nthose, or any other interesting plants which I may meet with. I send you\r\na few grasses; numbered; also a few mosses, etc. When you have leisure,\r\nyou will oblige me by sending the names of those numbered, and rectify\r\nany errors in those labeled. If you should be desirous of additional\r\nspecimens, please let me know it, and I will supply you in the course of\r\nnext summer.\r\n\r\nYou ask me whether I am desirous of obtaining the plants peculiar to New\r\nYork, New Jersey, etc., or of European plants. I should be highly\r\ngratified by receiving any plants you think proper to send me; and will\r\nrepay you, so far as in my power, by transmitting specimens of all the\r\ninteresting plants I discover. I know little of exotic botany, having no\r\nforeign specimens. I am particularly attached to the study of the\r\ngrasses, ferns, etc. If you have any specimens to transmit to me, please\r\nleave them with Mr. Franklin Brown, Attorney at Law, Inns of Court,\r\nBeekman Street, who will forward them to me by the earliest opportunity.\r\n\r\nDuring the next summer, I intend to visit the western part of this\r\nState, also Ohio and Michigan. I shall devote a large portion of my time\r\nto the collection of the plants of the places I visit. If you know of\r\nany interesting localities, or where any interesting plants could be\r\nprocured, please inform me, and I will endeavor to obtain them for you.\r\n\r\nRespectfully yours,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nBRIDGEWATER, April 6, 1832.\r\n\r\nHaving a convenient opportunity of sending to you, I improve it to\r\nacknowledge the receipt of your letter of October 6, and of the very\r\ninteresting and valuable package of plants which was duly received a few\r\nweeks afterwards. In the course of the ensuing summer, I shall be able\r\nto supply you with an additional supply of most of the plants mentioned\r\nin your list. Many of these were collected during an excursion to the\r\nwestern part of the State, and are not found in this section of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI have given a copy of this list to my friend Dr. N. W. Folwell of\r\nSeneca County, an industrious collector, who is situated in a section\r\nrich in plants, and requested him to transmit specimens of these and\r\nother interesting plants to you. I think he will be able to furnish you\r\nwith many interesting plants from that section of country, and I shall\r\nbe grateful for any favors you may have in your power to confer upon\r\nhim. I shall be engaged the ensuing summer at Fairfield and at Salina,\r\nwhere I hope to make some interesting collections in natural history. If\r\nit is not too much trouble and the specimen is within your reach, may I\r\nask further information with regard to No. 34, in my last package to\r\nyou. It is a Carex, from the shore of Lake Erie,--growing with C.\r\nlupulina but flowering later. Is it not a var. of C. lupulina? from\r\nwhich it appears to differ principally in its pedunculate spikes? It\r\nflowers a month later than C. lupulina (August 6).\r\n\r\nWill you excuse me for troubling you on another subject? I shall not be\r\nable to remain much longer in this place, unless I engage in the\r\npractice of medicine under circumstances which will altogether preclude\r\nme from paying any further attention to natural history. My friends\r\nadvise me to spend a few years in a milder climate, our family being\r\npredisposed to phthisis, although I am perfectly healthy and robust; and\r\nsuch a course would be very agreeable to me, as I could combine the\r\nstudy of natural history with the professional business which will be\r\nnecessary for my support. I have thought of the Southern States, but I\r\nhave for some time been inclined to prefer Mexico, both on account of\r\nthe salubrity of its climate, and of its botanical and mineralogical\r\nriches, which so far as I know have never been very thoroughly explored.\r\nMy object in troubling you with all this is merely to obtain some\r\ninformation with regard to the natural history of that country. Has the\r\ncountry been explored by any botanist since Humboldt in 1803? And is\r\nthere still room enough in that branch to repay one for devoting a few\r\nyears to its investigations?\r\n\r\nI am young (twenty-one), without any engagements to confine me to this\r\nsection of country, and prefer the study of botany to anything else.\r\nAlthough I have not arrived at any positive determination, I have\r\ncommenced the study of the Spanish language, and find it (with the aid\r\nof Latin and French) quite easy. I should be pleased to have your advice\r\non this subject, as you have many sources of information which are\r\nbeyond my reach. I should be highly gratified if you would state to me\r\nwhat you think of the prospects in Mexico for a person under my\r\ncircumstances, and whether any other section of country or any other\r\nsituation presents greater inducements. Under whatever circumstances I\r\nmay be placed, it will be gratifying to me to continue a correspondence\r\nwhich has, thus far, been so useful to me, and I shall always wish to\r\ndo all in my power to render it interesting to you. I shall be ready to\r\nleave this place by 1st of September next, at which time I shall\r\nprobably visit New York. Will you write me on this subject as soon as\r\nconvenient, and very much oblige,\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nP.S. There is within a circuit of some miles, and at this place, a great\r\nvariety of fossil organic remains, and I am collecting them as\r\nextensively as possible. We find trilobites (Asaphus, and occasionally\r\nCalymene), a variety of bivalve and a few univalve shells, etc., both in\r\nlime rock and greywacke. The celebrated locality of Trenton Falls you\r\nare of course acquainted with. Would a suit of them be acceptable to\r\nyourself, or the Lyceum of Natural History, New York? And can they be\r\nnamed, so that I can label my collection from them? There may few of\r\nthem be of any interest, but if you wish it you shall have a suit\r\ncontaining specimens of all I find.\r\n\r\nUTICA, January 2, 1833.\r\n\r\nI received your letter of December 25, and have given the subject of\r\nwhich you write a careful consideration. I may say that I have no\r\nobjection to the situation you propose, if a proper arrangement can be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe terms of my engagement here are these. This situation became vacant\r\nby the death of Mr. Edgerton in April last. I was recommended by some of\r\nmy friends, and finally made an arrangement for one year; took charge of\r\na class in botany and mineralogy on 20th May; closed July 30. Have been\r\nat liberty until now; have just commenced a chemical course, to\r\ncontinue nine weeks, which will conclude my duties for the year. The\r\ncompensation is board, room, washing, fuel, and all other expenses of\r\nthe kind, for the whole year, or as much of the year as I choose to\r\nremain here. All expenses of the laboratory are defrayed (which by the\r\nway are not likely to be heavy), and in addition I receive $300. The\r\nadvantages of the situation are, leisure and the means of a comfortable\r\nsupport. The disadvantages, the school is not incorporated and though\r\nnow flourishing may not continue so, the scholars are too young, the\r\nprincipal wishes to retain too much of the Eatonian plan to suit me, and\r\nthey have not furnished the means for the chemical course which I had a\r\nright to expect. No arrangement has been made for another year, but I\r\nhave reason to think I shall be requested to remain another year. I am\r\nconfident my leisure time would be employed to greater advantage if I\r\nwas situated so as to have access to good libraries and extensive\r\ncollections.\r\n\r\nAt present I can be satisfied with a moderate income, sufficient for a\r\ncomfortable support, for the purchase of a few books, etc.; but that\r\nincome must be sure; I cannot afford to run any risks about it. I would\r\nwillingly collect plants the whole summer, take on my hands the whole\r\nlabor of preparing and arranging them, but as the proceeds would be\r\nabsolutely necessary for my support, so they should be certain. I am now\r\nadvantageously situated for the collection of plants, etc., as, if I\r\nchoose, I can travel every year with a class who will defray my\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nIf you still desire to make such arrangement, please to state more\r\nexplicitly the duties you wish me to perform; how much time can be given\r\nto collecting plants; what compensation you can afford me, supposing\r\nnearly the whole summer is devoted to making collections, and three\r\nfourths of the whole to belong to you,--or propose any plan which would\r\nbe satisfactory to you, and I will let you know, very shortly, whether I\r\nwill accept it or not. I had rather leave it to yourself than to make\r\nany definite proposition at present. I am confident we can make an\r\narrangement which will be mutually beneficial.\r\n\r\nI need not say that I wish to hear from you again on this subject as\r\nsoon as possible, as I must soon make my arrangements for the ensuing\r\nseason. How large is the class at the Medical College? I have just\r\nreturned from a visit at Fairfield; they have a class of about 190. In\r\nhaste,\r\n\r\nYours very respectfully,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nUTICA, January 23, 1833.\r\n\r\nExcuse me for troubling you. I have this day received from Dr. L. C.\r\nBeck a sheet of a work, now publishing, entitled a “Flora of the\r\nNorthern and Middle States,” arranged according to the natural system. I\r\nhave the sheet commencing the species; commences with Ranunculaceæ; it\r\nis in 12mo.\r\n\r\nAs you mentioned that Beck has been very secret in all his proceedings,\r\nit occurred to me that very possibly you have heard nothing of it, and I\r\nthought it right to let you know. It appears to be after the fashion of\r\nDe Candolle’s “Prodromus,” condensed descriptions and fine print. He\r\nstill keeps his Ranunculus lacustris, and has added a new species to\r\nthat genus, which he calls R. Clintonii, from Rome, Oneida County, N.\r\nY.; the same as published in fifth edition Eaton’s “Manual” under the\r\nname of R. prostratus, Lamk. I have never seen their specimens, but have\r\nlittle doubt it is a form of R. repens, which flowers with us from April\r\nto September and assumes many forms. Dr. Beck wishes me to send him any\r\nundescribed or interesting plants, localities of rare plants, etc. I\r\nfeel somewhat interested in the work, as I wish it to supersede Eaton’s\r\nentirely. (I hear Eaton is coming out with a new edition in the spring.\r\nI see Beck means to anticipate him.) But all the undescribed plants I\r\nhave are in your hands, and it would be improper to send him such at\r\npresent. He has in his hands an imperfect specimen of Nasturtium natans,\r\nDe Candolle, which I sent him two years ago. He did not know it;\r\nsupposed it N. palustre, and I do not know whether he has determined it\r\nor no. I will tell him what it is. He has that Ophioglossum and probably\r\nwill publish it. If you please you can publish this, that Scleria, etc.,\r\nin Silliman, that is, if you think them new. I will send none of these\r\nto Beck, but will give him the localities of some of our most\r\ninteresting plants.\r\n\r\nI have not heard from you since I wrote you on the subject of your\r\nletter, but hope you will write me soon. If we can make any arrangement\r\nfor a year, by its expiration you will know whether or not I shall be of\r\nany use to you. I wish to be situated in such a manner as will enable me\r\nto advance most rapidly in science, in botany especially.\r\n\r\nI succeeded, some days ago, in making the chlorochromic acid of Dr.\r\nThomson (of which you spoke to me when at your house), with chromate of\r\nlead, instead of bichromate of potash, which I was unable to obtain. It\r\nset alcohol, ether, spirits of turpentine, etc., on fire. I did not try\r\nit upon phosphorus. Shall prepare it again in a few weeks for class\r\nexperiments. I am, Sir,\r\n\r\nYours respectfully,\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nUTICA, March 22, 1834.\r\n\r\nI thankfully acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 1st inst.,\r\nand am delighted to learn that you contemplate giving a course of\r\nbotanical lectures before you leave the city. I hope the plan will\r\nsucceed, and that you will have a large and very fashionable class. My\r\njourney was as tedious as rain and bad roads could make it. The first\r\nnight, being alone in the coach, I was upset by the carelessness of a\r\ndrunken driver. The top of the coach, striking against a stone wall, was\r\nbroken in; but I escaped, narrowly indeed, without any injury excepting\r\na few rents in my clothes. At the end of the route, I had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing the driver dismissed from his employment. On my\r\narrival at Bridgewater I found a child of my friend and former medical\r\npreceptor,[27] a favorite little daughter, dangerously, almost\r\nhopelessly sick with inflammation of the brain. I was consequently\r\ndetained several days, and before I left had the satisfaction of seeing\r\nthe little patient convalescent. I am now in fine working order and\r\nbusily engaged in my chemical course.\r\n\r\nDr. Hadley called upon me yesterday and I gave him the little “notions”\r\nyou sent by me. He was much pleased, but was especially delighted with\r\nthe condensed sulphurous and anhydrous sulphuric acids.\r\n\r\nThe principal object of this letter is to consult you in regard to some\r\npropositions made me by Professor Hadley. Besides his situation in the\r\nMedical College, you are aware that he holds the professorship of\r\nchemistry and natural science in Hamilton College. He has just concluded\r\nhis chemical course in that institution, but in the early part of summer\r\nhe lectures to the senior class upon botany and mineralogy. As they are\r\nabout to make some alterations in the college building at Fairfield, his\r\npresence will be required there, and he wishes me to take his place for\r\nthe ensuing term at Hamilton College. I ought also to state that Dr. H.\r\naccepted that situation with the intention of holding it but a few\r\nyears, until the college should have surmounted the trouble in which it\r\nwas (and is) involved, and from which we have pretty good reason to\r\nhope, from the exertions now being made, it will soon be extricated, so\r\nthat the professorships may be properly endowed. He has given notice of\r\nhis intention to resign about a year hence; by which time, if ever, the\r\ncollege will be able to place several professorships upon a substantial\r\nfoundation. Dr. H. has expressed to me a strong desire that I should be\r\nconsidered a candidate for the place, and I strongly suspect that to\r\nfurther that object is one reason for his wishing me to act as his\r\nsubstitute during the ensuing summer. My presence there would be\r\nnecessary from the 1st of June to the middle of July. Dr. H. has been\r\nacting under a nominal salary of $500, being engaged there but thirteen\r\nor fourteen weeks. For the summer course I should receive $200. Dr. H.\r\ninsures me $100 immediately, even if he has to advance it himself, and\r\nthe whole if funds are in the hands of the treasurer; if not, the whole\r\nwould be received quite certainly within the year. I have only to say\r\nfurther that the college has now one hundred students, is situated in a\r\nbeautiful village nine miles from Utica, has the best college buildings\r\nof any in the State, has a good faculty, etc. I urged the promise I had\r\nmade of the visit to Georgia, which this plan would entirely frustrate,\r\nbut promised to give him a definite answer within a fortnight.\r\n\r\nI can scarcely think of postponing my southern tour for another season;\r\nbut the question comes to this, whether, in the present state of my\r\nfinances, I had better expend $100 in that visit or earn $200 in the\r\nsame time. I could also, I think, continue my engagements here in July\r\nand August, by which a little more of the trash might be pocketed, and\r\nreturn to New York in time to make a September excursion to the dearly\r\nbeloved pine barrens of New Jersey, and spend the early part of fall in\r\nbotanical work, and the winter in your laboratory. The term closes here\r\nthe 23d of April (a little earlier than I supposed); so if the original\r\nplan is pursued I shall be in New York by the 26th of that month. If\r\nnot, I shall be disengaged for a month, a portion of which I should like\r\nto devote, with my friend Dr. Crawe, to the minerals of St. Lawrence\r\nCounty. So rests the case. I told Dr. H. that I should write immediately\r\nto you, and be governed in a good degree by your answer.\r\n\r\nI have such a dislike to the appearance of vacillation which results\r\nfrom changing one’s plans when fully formed, that were it not for\r\ncertain ulterior advantages, and that I wish to comply with the wishes,\r\nas far as may be, of a person to whom I am much obliged, I should\r\npromptly decline Dr. Hadley’s offer.\r\n\r\nAn idea just this moment strikes me which, in its crude shape, I will\r\ncommunicate. In eight or ten days I can get to the metals. Suppose I\r\ncould then get excused, and finish my course here next summer in\r\nconnection with mineralogy, which for these youngsters would do pretty\r\nwell; reach New York early next month; set out immediately for Georgia,\r\nand remain there until the latter part of May; return via Charleston;\r\nexamine Elliott’s herbarium, and return here by the first of June. I may\r\nbe quite sure that April and May would be healthy, but could there be\r\nplants enough collected, especially Gramineæ, to make it an object?\r\nPlease say what you think of it. If you think it will do, I see no\r\ninsuperable objection to carrying it into effect.\r\n\r\nA few days ago a letter reached me from Professor Lehmann, in answer to\r\nmy communication eighteen months ago. He is quite desirous of continuing\r\nthe correspondence. He is now particularly engaged with Hepaticæ, and is\r\nanxious to obtain our species, and especially original specimens of\r\nthose described by the late Mr. Schweinitz, etc. He has sent a box\r\n(which by this time I hope has arrived in New York) containing about\r\nfive hundred species of plants and several botanical books. He also\r\nwrites that he has applied to Nees von Esenbeck for dried specimens of\r\nall the species of Aster cultivated in his garden in order to transmit\r\nthem with the monograph by that author; but not having arrived in time\r\nthey will be sent with his next package. I wish to be particularly\r\nremembered to Mrs. Torrey and to Mr. Shaw, not forgetting my lively\r\nlittle friends J----, E----, and M----, whom I very much long to see. I\r\nhad intended long before this to have written to Mr. Shaw, but have not\r\nyet had leisure. Please say to him that I am much obliged for the papers\r\nhe has been so good as to send me. I wish to know whether he has yet\r\napostatized from the anti-tea-drinking society, of which Mr. S. and\r\nmyself were (“par nobile fratrum”) such promising members. Please say to\r\nhim that I have not yet drunk tea, but am doing penance upon coffee,\r\nmilk, and water.\r\n\r\nMay I trouble you for the very earliest possible answer to this, which\r\nwill much oblige\r\n\r\nYours very respectfully,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nHAMILTON COLLEGE, June 9, 1834.\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 13th ult., with the bundle of books, was in due time\r\nreceived. Yours of the 2d ult. was received at the same time. I can send\r\nyou no more copies of “Gramineæ,”[28] etc.; all I brought up are\r\nsubscribed for and delivered. “Major Downing,” who subscribes for two\r\ncopies (one for himself and one for his friend the Gin’ral,[29] I\r\nsuppose), as well as the other subscribers, must wait until fall. I am\r\nlecturing here to a small but quite intelligent Senior class, twenty-six\r\nin number, just enough to fill three sides of a large table, and time\r\npasses very pleasantly. The small fund for the support of this\r\ninstitution will, I think, be secured, but the trustees do not act in\r\nconcert with the faculty, and it is rumored quarrel among themselves, so\r\nthat, unless some changes are effected in the board, I fear the college\r\nwill not be sustained. I shall remain here five weeks longer, and then\r\nhave a short engagement at Utica. I have promised to make a visit to the\r\nnorth in August. I wish very much that I was able to remain there six or\r\nseven weeks, to examine with attention the vegetation of the primitive\r\nregion in St. Lawrence and Franklin counties. I cannot doubt that the\r\nmountains and the banks of the large streams of that region would\r\nfurnish a rich harvest of plants. That range is an extension of one from\r\nthe far north, which, passing between the Great Lakes and Hudson’s Bay,\r\ncrosses the St. Lawrence at the Thousand Islands, and passes through St.\r\nLawrence, Franklin, and Clinton counties. Consequently many sub-alpine\r\nplants, such as Anemone Hudsonica, Trisetum molle, Geum triflorum, etc.,\r\nare found in this region farther south than elsewhere. The mineralogy of\r\nthe region, also, needs to be farther explored. The expense of such a\r\ntour, divided between Dr. Crawe and myself, traveling in a conveyance of\r\nour own, will be comparatively trifling.\r\n\r\nI find, however, that further supplies of several New Jersey grasses are\r\nabsolutely required to enable me to make out the necessary number of\r\nsuits this fall of the first part of my “Grasses.” I see also by the\r\nlist before me that they (with few exceptions) are in good state as late\r\nas the 8th or 10th of September, and that they can all be obtained\r\nwithout proceeding farther south than Tom’s River; so that I have no\r\nalternative but to hasten back to New York, and make a flying trip to\r\nTom’s River (or Howel Works at least) early in September. If you meet\r\nwith Panicum agrostoides, Poa obtusa Muhl., and Poa eragrostis, I shall\r\nbe much obliged if you will secure for me the needful quantity of\r\nspecimens. I am making arrangements for securing the bulbs, tubers, and\r\nseeds of the rarer plants for Lehmann. I shall take great pleasure in\r\ncomplying with your desire of securing as many as possible for your\r\nlittle garden. Bulbs and tubers I take up after flowering, and place in\r\ndry sand. Can you give some instructions as to the best manner of\r\npreserving other perennial roots, such as Asters, etc.? If you will give\r\nme the necessary instructions, I promise you to spare no exertions to\r\ncarry them into effect.\r\n\r\nI have nearly finished De Candolle’s “Théorie Elémentaire.” I have\r\ndevoured it like a novel. It ought to be translated, that it may be more\r\ngenerally read in this country, where something of the kind is much\r\nneeded. By the way, as soon as you receive Lindley’s new elementary\r\nwork, I hope you will set about preparing an American edition.\r\n\r\nThis immediate neighborhood is very poor for botanizing. Excepting\r\nCyperaceæ, it furnishes nothing of interest. I shall soon, however, make\r\nmore distant excursions, so as to include Oneida Lake and the “pine\r\nplains.” When I return I shall bring with me a huge bundle of plants,\r\nwhich will show that I have not been idle.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER\r\n\r\nNovember 21, 1834.\r\n\r\nThe class at the Medical College is very small, so that I have no salary\r\nhere at present. But I have a comfortable and pleasant home, and fine\r\nopportunities for pursuing my favorite studies, and for acquiring a\r\nreputation that must sooner or later secure me a good place. I have work\r\nenough thrown into my hands to support me, with my prudent habits,\r\nthrough the winter. I spend my time entirely at the medical college and\r\nat my home here at Dr. Torrey’s, and hold little intercourse with any\r\nexcept medical and scientific men. I am writing two scientific articles\r\non a difficult branch of botany for a scientific journal or magazine,\r\nwhich will give me a little notoriety. Dr. Torrey and myself went last\r\nmonth to Philadelphia, where we stayed a week. We spent our time almost\r\nentirely in the rooms of the American Philosophical Society, and of the\r\nAcademy of Science. We met most of the scientific and other learned men,\r\nand spent our time very pleasantly. You shall hear from me again before\r\nlong. It is not probable that I shall be up before next summer.\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER\r\n\r\nSaturday Morning, February 7, 1835.\r\n\r\nI do not know when I shall see you. I shall be up sometime during the\r\nspring or summer if I live so long, but perhaps not until July or\r\nAugust. It is very probable that I shall stay in the city the whole\r\ntime. I wish very much to spend a few weeks in Georgia, early in the\r\nspring, but I see that I shall not be able to do so. My time is spent\r\nhere very profitably, and I am advancing in knowledge as fast as I ought\r\nto wish, but I make no money, or scarcely enough to live upon. Just at\r\npresent I am rather behindhand, but think that by next fall I shall,\r\nwith ordinary success, be in better circumstances. It is unpleasant to\r\nbe embarrassed in such matters, for I should like much to be\r\nindependent, and this with my moderate wishes would require no very\r\nlarge sum, and I have no great desire to be rich.\r\n\r\nTell father I am very glad he has brought home the remainder of those\r\nboxes from Utica. The burning down of one of the buildings of the\r\ngymnasium has broken up that school entirely, and it probably will not\r\nbe revived. I knew Mr. Bartlett would fail soon, and that accident has\r\nonly hastened the time a little. He has been insolvent for some time.\r\nThere was a very severe fire within a few rods of us last week; five or\r\nsix dwelling-houses and other buildings were burned to the ground.\r\nAlthough it was so near us we were sitting at tea entirely unconcerned.\r\nEverything is done by the fire companies, and people who crowd about\r\nfires are only in the way, without doing any good.\r\n\r\nLet me hear from you soon, and you will hear from me again in due\r\nseason. The lectures in the Medical College will be finished in about\r\nthree weeks, and then I shall be a little more at leisure.\r\n\r\nI am very affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, April 6, 1835.\r\n\r\nDEAR FATHER,--I have been waiting for some time to see what my plans for\r\nthe season would be, expecting as soon as that point was determined to\r\nwrite to you. All my arrangements were upset last fall, and the\r\nprospects for daily bread have been rather dark all winter--that is for\r\nthe present; for the future they look as well as I could expect. It is\r\nprobable now that I shall remain here during the summer; prosecuting the\r\nsame studies and pursuits in which I am now engaged, unless something\r\nelse turns up in the mean time....\r\n\r\nTell mother I have for her a copy of Barnes’s “Notes of the Gospels,”\r\nbut I want to read it myself before I send it up. Perhaps I can’t spare\r\nit until I come up. I think you will all be very much pleased with it. I\r\nwish I could also send you his “Notes on the Acts and Romans.” Please\r\nask Mr. Rogers, or any of your merchants when they come to New York this\r\nspring, to drop a line in the post-office for me, that I may take the\r\nopportunity of sending home by them. I wish I could come up this spring,\r\nbut I see that I shall not be able. Do you take a religious newspaper?\r\nPlease write to me soon. May the Lord prosper you and keep you all.\r\n\r\nYours truly and affectionately,\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, April 4, 1835.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your kind letter of December 11, with the parcel of books you\r\nwere so good as to send me, were in due time received, for both of which\r\nI beg you to accept my thanks. Perhaps you will do me the favor to\r\naccept a copy of the second part of the “North American Gramineæ and\r\nCyperaceæ,” being a continuation of my attempt to illustrate our species\r\nof these families, the plan of which, I am gratified to learn, meets\r\nyour approbation. I inclose in the same parcel the loose sheets of an\r\nunpublished portion of the third volume of the “Annals of the New York\r\nLyceum of Natural History,” comprising an attempt at a monography of the\r\ngenus Rhynchospora. A more perfect copy, with a copy of the engraving,\r\nnow in the hands of the artist, will be transmitted to you by the\r\nearliest opportunity. I also send a little parcel of mosses, nearly all\r\nof which were collected in the interior of the State of New York. May I\r\nask you to look them over at as early an opportunity as may suit your\r\nconvenience, and to return to me the result of your determinations. I do\r\nnot venture to think that you will find among them anything of especial\r\ninterest. I very much regret that I am at the present moment unable to\r\nforward to you a half a dozen copies of the work of “Gramineæ and\r\nCyperaceæ,” the number you so kindly offer to take charge of. A few\r\nspecies are wanting to complete further suits of the first volume, but\r\nthese I hope soon to obtain. Not to permit your kind offer to pass\r\nwholly unimproved, I hereby transmit to you three copies of vols. 1 and\r\n2 which are at the disposal of any of your botanical friends who may\r\ndesire to possess the work. If an additional number of copies should be\r\nneeded they can in a very short time be furnished. With high respect, I\r\nremain, dear sir,\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTo WILLIAM JACKSON HOOKER, LL. D.,\r\nRegius Professor of Botany in the University at Glasgow.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nSAUQUOIT, N.Y., July 9, 1835.\r\n\r\nI am progressing a little with my rather formidable task; in fact I am\r\nmaking haste quite slowly, and am now discussing the mysteries of\r\nexogenous and endogenous stems. I have studied little this week, for I\r\nfound that close confinement was spoiling my health, so I have been\r\ntaking quite severe exercise almost constantly, by which I am\r\nconsiderably improved already, although my bones ache prodigiously. I\r\nhave not yet botanized largely. When at Bridgewater I secured all I\r\ncould find of the new Carex; also C. chordorhiza, which, by the way,\r\nCrawe has found in his region. I hope soon to collect more extensively,\r\nbut in this vicinity there are no plants of especial interest. I have\r\njust now a mania for examining and preserving the roots and fruits of\r\nour plants (I make notes of everything in a copy of your “Compendium”),\r\nand I hope to bring you a collection in this way which will interest,\r\nand perhaps be of some use to you. Fruits and ripe seeds are not often\r\nto be obtained, at least in a proper state, in our herbaria. I have been\r\nexamining our Smilax rotundifolia. It is a regular endogenous shrub,\r\nalthough it sometimes dies nearly to the ground, but always sends out a\r\nbranch from the uppermost node which survives the winter. It branches\r\njust as any endogen would, because the terminal bud is killed; the\r\nbranches are cylindrical, and increase very little in diameter after\r\ntheir production. A cross-section shows the same structure as the\r\nrattan, i.e., the vascular and woody bundles are arranged equally\r\nthroughout the stem. But a great part of the stem is prostrate beneath\r\nthe surface, and it may be traced back, alive and dead, for several\r\nyears’ growth. In fact I have not yet succeeded in tracing the stem back\r\nto the true root; all I have seen are adventitious roots sent of by the\r\nnodes of the stem. This is the only endogenous shrub, I presume, in the\r\nNorthern States. By the way, the term rhizoma must be used much in\r\ndescriptive botany, and be extended so as to include all subterranean,\r\nnearly horizontal stems, or portions of the stem, which produce roots\r\nfrom any part of their surface and buds from their extremity. It occurs\r\nin a great part of herbaceous perennials, and can always in practice be\r\ndistinguished from the root, although it is still described as root in\r\nall the books; witness, Hydrophyllum, Actæa, Caulophyllum, Trillium,\r\nConvallaria, and so on to infinity.\r\n\r\nI am not yet perfectly satisfied about our Actæas; thus the red-berried\r\none is now perfectly ripe, while the berries of the white one are but\r\nhalf-grown; all the red ones, so far as I have seen, have slender\r\npedicels also, yet the leaves and the rhizomata are exactly alike. By\r\nthe way, while I was botanizing this afternoon, I met with great\r\nquantities of Orchis spectabilis, by far the largest and finest I ever\r\nsaw; their leaves emulating Habenaria orbiculata. If you care for them\r\nin the slightest degree, I will secure a sufficient quantity to fill\r\nyour garden. O. spectabilis will, while in flower, be a very pretty\r\nspectacle....\r\n\r\nI remain cordially and truly yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, September 28, 1835.\r\n\r\nI suppose I have been a little negligent in waiting so long before I\r\nwrote home, but in truth I did not wish to write until I had something\r\ncertain to say, and even now I have very little. I met Dr. Hadley in\r\nUtica just at dusk on the evening of the day you left me there, so I\r\nstayed all night there, and went to Fairfield next day. I stayed at\r\nFairfield until Tuesday afternoon, then went to Little Falls, and\r\narrived in Albany just in time for the evening boat next day, and was in\r\nNew York at breakfast next morning.\r\n\r\nSince my return I have been very busy, and on the whole very comfortably\r\nsituated. I have got back to my class in the Sunday-school; both\r\nteachers and scholars have mostly returned, for they all get scattered\r\nduring the warm months of the summer; and we are now going on very well.\r\nOn my arrival here I found a very fine package of dried plants collected\r\nby my friend the Rev. John Diell, chaplain for American seamen in the\r\nSandwich Islands. I set about them immediately, and it has taken me\r\nnearly all my time this month to study them, but I have now finished\r\nthem. I shall send my notes about them to Professor Hooker of Glasgow,\r\nScotland, that he may, if he pleases, publish them in the “Journal of\r\nBotany,” of which he is the editor. They are of more interest to the\r\npeople on that side of the water than to us. I have again sat down to\r\nwriting upon the work in which I have been engaged all summer, and I do\r\nnot mean that anything else shall tempt me from it until it is finished,\r\nalthough a nice little parcel of weeds from China, sent by S. Wells\r\nWilliams[30] (son of Wm. Williams), lies at my elbow. As to my book,[31]\r\nI am trying to make a bargain with two publishers; the prospects seem\r\npretty fair, and I shall probably get $300, which is the sum I insist\r\non. I shall have a definite answer in a few days. As to my course and\r\noccupation for the winter I can say nothing, for I have not hit upon any\r\ncertain plan. One thing is pretty certain after thinking over the matter\r\nquite seriously, and consulting with Dr. Hadley, who is my firm friend\r\nin all these matters; I am determined to persevere for a little while\r\nyet before I give up all hopes from science as a pursuit for life. I\r\nhave now, and expect to have, a great many discouragements, but I shall\r\nmeet them as well as I can, until it shall seem to be my duty to adopt\r\nsome other profession for my daily bread. I have several plans before\r\nme, some of which you would think rather bold; but I have not yet\r\nsettled upon any of them. As soon as I take any steps at all I will let\r\nyou know....\r\n\r\nI know little of what is going on in the town. I have not been down into\r\nthe business part of the city over five or six times since I have been\r\nhere. When Mr. Rogers comes down, if he will let me know where he stops\r\nin season, I will see him. I shall write again to some of you in a very\r\nshort time. Let me hear soon from some of you, and though I have here\r\nlittle time for writing letters, I will give punctual answers. I remain,\r\nwith love to mother and all the rest,\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, November 17, 1835.\r\n\r\nTo-day when I go down town I shall subscribe for the “New York Observer”\r\nfor you, and pay for a year. The “Observer” and the “Evangelist” are\r\nboth excellent papers, and I hardly know which to choose. I would send\r\nthe “Evangelist,” did not Mr. Leavitt fill it up too much with\r\nanti-slavery. One should if possible read both.\r\n\r\nI am now boarding at 286 Bleeker Street, but when you write to me you\r\nmay direct as before, as I am at Dr. Torrey’s a part of almost every\r\nday. I have a very comfortable and quiet place, for which I pay $4 per\r\nweek, and keep a fire besides, which I suppose will startle you a\r\nlittle. I hope to obtain the situation of curator to the Lyceum of\r\nNatural History in the spring, when their new building is finished. The\r\nduties of the situation will take up only a part of my time. I shall\r\nhave under my charge the best scientific library and cabinet in the\r\ncity, a couple of fine rooms to live in, and a salary of about $300. But\r\nalthough I can secure pretty strong influence, the best members of the\r\nsociety offering me the place and wishing me to take it, yet it is not\r\ncertain that we shall bring it about, so I say nothing about it. I shall\r\nlet you know whenever any changes offer in my situation.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, July 11, 1836.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,--Since your departure several memoranda of more or less\r\nconsequence have accumulated around me, and (having not yet heard from\r\nyou) I will now communicate them, together with whatever intelligence I\r\nthink will interest you. To begin with the most important. I have now (5\r\nP.M.) just returned from your house, where I found a parcel for you\r\n(received by mail from Philadelphia, postage the mere trifle of\r\n$1.14-1/2), with the Hamburg seal, and the handwriting of our old\r\ncorrespondent, Professor Lehmann. Suspecting it to contain advice of\r\npackages of plants or books, I took the liberty to open it. I found two\r\ndiplomas in high Dutch. Shade of Leopoldino-Carolineæ Cæsar. academiæ\r\nnaturæ curiosorum! Hide your diminished head, and give way to the\r\nKönigliche Botanische Gesellschaft in Regensburg!--which being\r\ninterpreted means, I imagine, the Royal Botanical Society of Regensburg.\r\nNow I know as little of Regensburg and the Regensburg people who have\r\ndone us such honor as a certain old lady did of the famous King of\r\nPrussia; but I ratherly think it means Ratisbon....\r\n\r\nBox of plants and box of bones are here; the plants certainly look the\r\nmore antediluvian of the two. The specimens are wretched and mostly\r\ndevoid of interest. The bones will be served up at the Lyceum this\r\nevening.... On the same day last week I received a letter from\r\nDewey,[32] and another from Carey, and according to both their accounts\r\nthey must have been in raptures with each other. Dewey sends love to\r\nfriend Torrey, and Carey kind regards to Dr. and Mrs. T. Dewey says\r\nCarey is rather savage upon species, and where Carey has not given him a\r\nfavorable opinion upon any, it would amuse you to see how Dewey has\r\ndetailed them to me, in order if possible to save the poor creatures’\r\nlives. Dewey has a good spirit and is altogether a most estimable man,\r\nand I am sorry that we have to pull down any of his work. I must write\r\nhim a few things, that it may not come upon him all at once....\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, April 7, 1836.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I take the opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of your\r\ntwo kind letters, which reached me a few weeks since nearly at the same\r\ntime, one by the Liverpool packet and the other by the Lady Hannah\r\nEllice. Allow me also to thank you for the trouble you have taken in\r\nnaming the set of mosses, and especially for the beautiful parcel of\r\nBritish mosses you were so good as to send me, which were truly welcome.\r\nAll British plants are so, as I have next to none in my herbarium; but\r\nnothing could be more acceptable than such a complete and authentic suit\r\nof the mosses of your country.\r\n\r\nAs to the Sandwich Island plants, I hardly know what to say. Supposing\r\nthey might be of some use to you in connection with other collections, I\r\ncopied the brief notes I made on studying them very hurriedly indeed,\r\nand placed them at your disposal. I did not possess sufficient means for\r\ndetermining them in a satisfactory manner, and fear I have committed\r\nerrors in many cases. You will doubtless detect these at once, and if,\r\non the whole, you think proper to publish them in the “Companion to the\r\nBotanical Magazine,” may I ask you to revise the paper, and freely make\r\nsuch corrections and alterations as you think proper. In that case, if\r\nyou think the notes worthy of publication, I should not object; yet you\r\nare equally at liberty to use them in any other way. The parcel\r\ncontained a specimen of a Composita (from Mouna Kea) which puzzled me\r\nextremely, and I was unable to ascertain its genus by Lessing. The\r\nanthers are free, or slightly coherent, in all the flowers I examined.\r\nSince the parcel was transmitted to you I have seen a specimen of Rhus\r\n(from Sandwich Islands) resembling the one in the parcel, except in\r\nhaving pubescent leaves. The latter is therefore improperly\r\ncharacterized, and perhaps will prove to be a well-known species. I\r\nshall hope to receive other and more complete specimens from Mr. Diell,\r\nand if I am so fortunate will gladly share with so esteemed a\r\ncorrespondent as Dr. Hooker. I hope to send you a parcel by the first\r\nopportunity that occurs of sending direct to Glasgow: when I will put up\r\nspecimens of the mosses you desire, and will send a copy of the\r\n“Gramineæ and Cyperaceæ” for the gentleman at Paris who wishes it.\r\n\r\nIt is so troublesome and expensive to get them bound that I should much\r\nprefer, if any of your friends and correspondents should desire them, to\r\nsend the specimens with labels and loose title-pages, at $4 per volume,\r\neach comprising, as you are aware, one hundred species. I may in that\r\nway furnish larger and often more perfect or more numerous specimens\r\nthan in the bound copies. I hope to publish the third (and perhaps also\r\nthe fourth) volume early next autumn.\r\n\r\nAllow me to express my thanks for your kind assistance in various ways,\r\nand to say that I shall hereafter (D. V.) prosecute the study of our\r\nlovely science with increased zeal. I remain, with sentiments of the\r\nhighest esteem,\r\n\r\nYour much obliged friend,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nOctober 10, 1836.\r\n\r\nI also beg your acceptance of a copy of a little elementary botanical\r\nwork published last spring. I do not expect it to possess any particular\r\ninterest in your eyes; but in this country, unfortunately, no popular\r\nand at the same time scientific elementary treatise has been generally\r\naccessible to botanical students, and such a work was so greatly needed\r\nthat I felt constrained to make the attempt, since no better-qualified\r\nperson could be induced to undertake the labor.\r\n\r\nA letter which Dr. Torrey has just received from Mr. Arnott gives me the\r\ninformation that you have honored my attempt at a monograph of\r\nRhynchospora by commencing the reprinting of it in the “Companion to the\r\nBotanical Magazine.” I might justly be proud that my first attempt\r\nshould be thought worthy such notice; but I wish it had been delayed\r\nuntil you could receive the monograph “Cyperaceæ of North America” of\r\nDr. Torrey, in which I had occasion, in the revision of our\r\nRhynchosporæ, to make some important alterations and corrections, as\r\nwell as to introduce a new species and specify some additional\r\nlocalities. The paper referred to I hope you will receive with this\r\nletter.\r\n\r\nExcept a few extra copies, all the sheets of the monograph\r\n“Rhynchosporæ” were destroyed by fire soon after being printed, and when\r\nreprinted, about a year since, I added a few observations, notes of\r\nadditional localities, etc. But owing to a want of careful revision I\r\nfind there are several errors (several of which are quite material),\r\nsome of the pen and others of the types. I hope these have been detected\r\nand corrected in the course of the reprint. I send herewith the sheets\r\nof the paper as published here, with such typographical corrections as\r\nnow occur to me. Would it not be proper to append a reprint of the\r\nrevision of Rhynchosporæ in Dr. Torrey’s monograph, a copy of which I\r\nhope will reach you with the present letter. If the specimens I send\r\nplease Mr. Webb I shall be glad. It is the last perfect set I have.\r\nPlease make no remittance, since the sum is too trifling, and moreover I\r\nmay soon have some favors to ask as to its disposal. Indeed, I know not\r\nwhy I should not state that there is some probability that I may soon\r\nvisit the islands of the South Pacific Ocean as a botanist, in the\r\nexploring expedition now fitting out under the orders of our government.\r\nI am anxious to engage in this work, and I suppose may do so if I\r\nchoose, but I fear that the expedition, which, if well appointed and\r\nconducted, may do much for the advancement of the good cause of science,\r\nmay be so marred by improper appointments as to render it unadvisable\r\nfor me to be connected with it. I therefore at present can merely throw\r\nout the intimation that I may possibly accompany the naval expedition\r\nwhich is expected to sail early in the spring, and to spend two years in\r\nthe southern portions of the Pacific Ocean. If so I hope to decide the\r\nmatter in time to procure many needed works, etc., from England and\r\nFrance. I must here close by subscribing myself, with the highest\r\nrespect,\r\n\r\nYour obedient servant,\r\nASA GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, October 8, 1836.\r\n\r\nYou may recollect that I intimated to you that there was some\r\nprobability of my changing my situation before a great while. Matters\r\nare now in such a state that it becomes proper to inform you that I\r\nshall probably be offered the situation of botanist to the scientific\r\nexploring expedition, now fitting out for the South Sea by the United\r\nStates government. This is to be a large expedition, consisting of a\r\nfrigate, two brigs, a store-ship, and a schooner; it is to be absent\r\nabout three years. It will sail possibly in the course of the winter,\r\nbut very probably not until spring. The scientific corps will consist of\r\nseveral persons, in different departments of science, and the persons\r\nwho will probably be selected are mostly my personal friends: two of\r\nthem at least having been recommended at my suggestion. The quarters\r\noffered us, and the accommodations, will be ample and complete, and the\r\npay will probably be considerable. We hope to obtain over $2500 per\r\nyear. Had I room here I would write you further particulars, but this\r\nwill do for the present. I ask whether, if everything is arranged in a\r\nsatisfactory manner, you are willing and think it best that I should go.\r\nI think it not unlikely that the appointments will be made during the\r\npresent month. A few days ago I was offered the professorship of\r\nchemistry and natural history in the college at Jackson, Louisiana (in\r\nthe upper part of that State, near the Mississippi River), with a salary\r\nof $1500 per year. This I at once declined. I do not like the Southern\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nYours affectionately,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, November 21, 1836.\r\n\r\nNo appointments are yet made in the scientific corps of the South Sea\r\nexpedition. The difficulties as to the naval officers are only just\r\nsettled. There are so many who wish to command that it is impossible to\r\nplease them all. Captain Jones, the commander, is now in town, and I had\r\nthe pleasure of seeing him this evening at the Astor hotel. He goes to\r\nBoston to-morrow to look after the two brigs fitting out at the navy\r\nyard there.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Navy has written me that when the appointments are\r\nmade in the scientific corps, the chief naturalists will be called to\r\nWashington for a few days, for the distribution of duties among them. If\r\nthe place for which I ask is given me, it is not unlikely that I may be\r\nin Washington early next month. I think you cannot expect E. and myself\r\nbefore about Thanksgiving Day, when if she should have recovered we\r\nshall have one reason more than usual for returning thanks to the Author\r\nof all good. You did not, it appears, think it a matter of sufficient\r\nconsequence to say anything about my contemplated voyage; or to offer\r\neven an opinion about the matter. Perhaps you thought that, like most\r\npeople, I only asked advice after I had made up my own mind; and you are\r\nnot far from correct in this supposition. Still I should have been glad\r\nto know that you take some interest in the matter.\r\n\r\nAs soon as anything is determined upon at headquarters I will let you\r\nknow....\r\n\r\nMarch 21, 1837.\r\n\r\nSince I wrote you last I have been to Washington. I was there at the\r\ninauguration and for a few days afterwards. We were not sent for by the\r\nSecretary of the Navy, so we had to bear our own traveling expenses,\r\nwhich were not small. When the secretary chooses to convene us, which he\r\nseems in no great hurry to do, we shall probably be directed to meet at\r\nPhiladelphia, or perhaps at New York. There seems to be no doubt but\r\nthat we shall be here until July.\r\n\r\nAs they do not choose to advance us any pay yet, money will be very\r\nscarce with me for a month or two at least. My engagement at the Lyceum\r\nterminated at the close of their year, that is, on the last Monday of\r\nlast month. So, although I occupy my rooms here until the first of May,\r\nI draw no salary.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN F. TROWBRIDGE.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, November 9, 1837.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,--Your letter and that of Mrs. T., dated November 7, reached\r\nme this afternoon, to which I hasten to reply, as I have been just on\r\nthe point of writing you for a week past, but have waited from day to\r\nday, in the expectation of being able to afford you more definite\r\ninformation than I could have done. It is this, rather than want of time\r\nor inclination, that often causes the delay in writing to my friends.\r\nThe intelligence which concerns us and interests our friends comes in\r\nlittle by little, day by day. Thus, for instance, the scientific corps\r\nwere ordered to report here to Commander Jones nearly three weeks ago,\r\nand they have been here waiting for a long time, for the secretary had\r\nneglected to inform Jones of the fact, and he had come back to his home,\r\nand only returned here this week. However, we have now reported and\r\nshall take possession of our quarters in a fortnight. They are now\r\nundergoing some alterations. We have appointed a caterer, advanced each\r\n$120, and our stores will now be soon laid in. The purser of our\r\nsquadron to-day paid us four months’ pay in advance, a very seasonable\r\nassistance. My bills having been approved by the government I am now\r\npaying them off, and must see to getting all my materials packed up and\r\nsent to the vessels, which are now lying at the navy yard, Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nThis will employ me for a day or two. It is impossible even now to tell\r\nyou the time of sailing with any certainty. My opinion is that we shall\r\nget off about the first or before the 10th of December. It is certain\r\nthat the ships and stores will not be ready within three weeks, and it\r\nwould not surprise me, after what I have seen, if we should be kept back\r\nlonger than you expect. Let us once get to sea and you will not see or\r\nhear of so much dilatoriness from us.\r\n\r\nNovember 10. I was prevented from closing my letter last evening by the\r\ncalling of Professor Henry, who has just returned from a visit of nine\r\nmonths to France and Great Britain. I have been very much engaged all\r\nday, and sit down now for a little time, hoping to finish a few letters\r\nwhich have been delayed too long already.\r\n\r\nDecember 5.\r\n\r\nI am here yet, and am like to be for a month or so. Commander Jones has\r\nbeen sick for two or three weeks, and I am sorry to say there seems\r\nlittle probability that he will be much better ever. He has a bad cough,\r\nand raises blood--is of a consumptive habit. As he has been growing\r\nworse, he this morning left for Philadelphia, on his way home. It is\r\nthus most probable that we shall have a new commander, and a\r\nconsiderable delay is unavoidable. I think the secretary will be put\r\nright this winter by Congress.\r\n\r\nDo let me know how Mrs. Trowbridge is. Please send this note to my\r\nfather, as it is a week or more since I wrote. As soon as anything\r\nfurther is known I will let you know.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nJuly 18, 1838.\r\n\r\nDEAR TRO,--I find, by turning over some books that have been lying on my\r\ntable, four reviews which certainly ought to have been sent you long\r\nago, but which have been forgotten in my great hurry for the last week\r\nor two. I will send them, with this, to-morrow: so look out for them. I\r\nhave not heard from you since I wrote you a pretty long epistle.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th instant I tendered my resignation, or rather requested to be\r\nleft out in the new arrangement. I supposed that it would have been\r\naccepted and no words made; but instead Mr. Poinsett sends me word to\r\ncome on to Washington and have a talk with him, to learn more definitely\r\nwhat their plans, etc., are, and thinks he will be able to remove my\r\npresent dissatisfaction, and if not says I may have leave to withdraw,\r\nbut urges me not to insist upon resigning without coming on to\r\nWashington. Dana and Couthony are also invited to come on, Pickering\r\nbeing already there. Though this request reaches me in such a form that\r\nI cannot claim my traveling expenses, and probably shall not get them\r\n(which is just like this nasty administration), yet I suppose I must go\r\non. The only difficulty is that I am afraid they will ply me with such\r\nstrong reasons as to prevail on me to hold my situation, particularly as\r\ntheir new plan has the advantage of leaving home all the blockheads and\r\ntaking the best fellows; and moreover some other very promising offers\r\nthat I had have not been brought to bear very directly; in fact I see\r\nthat I should get nothing satisfactory from them for a year or two. I\r\nintend to set out for Washington to-morrow afternoon. I shall endeavor\r\nto make a very short stay, and if I come to any determination there I\r\nwill try to let you know.\r\n\r\nI have scarcely time to write another letter; so please send this up to\r\nmy father, who has not heard from me in a good while.\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\nA. G.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, August 6, 1838.\r\n\r\nI have resigned my place in the exploring expedition! So that job is got\r\nalong with. I have been long in a state of uncertainty and perplexity\r\nabout the matter; but I believe that I have taken the right course. I\r\nleave here to-morrow, and am obliged to travel as fast as I can go to\r\nDetroit. I shall drop this note on the road somewhere: probably at\r\nUtica. I must get as near to Detroit as possible by Saturday evening. I\r\nhope to return in the latter part of the month; and intend to make you a\r\nvisit on my way back.\r\n\r\nTO MRS. TORREY.\r\n\r\nBATAVIA, GENESEE COUNTY, N. Y.\r\nFriday morning, August 10, 1838.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MRS. TORREY,--The place from which I write is a very pleasant\r\nand flourishing country village; the shire-town of Genesee County,\r\nforty-four miles from Buffalo and about thirty-four from Rochester. Here\r\nis your humble servant and correspondent “laid up for repairs.” This is,\r\nyou may say, my first stopping-place since I left New York, from which\r\nplace I am distant 418 miles. But I may as well begin at the beginning.\r\nI left home, as you remember, on Tuesday evening; breakfasted in Albany,\r\ndined at Utica, took stage immediately for Buffalo. We took our supper\r\nat Chittenango, which Dr. T. will recollect as the Ultima Thule of our\r\nperegrinations in the summer of 1826, and near which place we found the\r\nScolopendrium. Riding all night we were at Auburn (a lovely village) by\r\ndaybreak, and, passing through Geneva, arrived at Canandaigua in time\r\nfor dinner. We reached Avon, on the Genesee River, by sunset. Here is a\r\nfamous sulphur spring; and people crowd the dirty hotels and\r\nboarding-houses to drink nasty water. We reached the next considerable\r\nvillage, LeRoy, early in the evening; but our next stage, which brought\r\nus to this place, only ten miles, was two and a half hours; so it was\r\nabout midnight when I arrived here, in a very pitiable plight, so\r\nthoroughly exhausted I was obliged to leave the coach and betake myself\r\nto rest. I was very unwilling to do this so long as I was able to ride,\r\nas, had I continued with the coach, I should have reached Buffalo early\r\nin the morning and in time for the steamboat, in which case I could\r\nexpect to reach Detroit Saturday afternoon, making only four days from\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nI find myself much better this morning, though weak, and so unstable\r\nabout the epigastrium that I scarcely dare take any food. I have been\r\ndebating with myself whether to go on directly to Buffalo to-day, and\r\ntake the steamboat of to-morrow morning for Cleveland, or some other\r\nport in Ohio that I may be able to reach by Saturday evening; or to go\r\nfrom this place directly to Niagara Falls, which I could reach before\r\nevening, and remain there until Monday morning. I have pretty nearly\r\ndecided upon taking the former course, as I shall save some time\r\nthereby. But I dread a tedious ride in a stagecoach. In either case I\r\nhope to have an opportunity of writing again to-morrow evening.\r\n\r\nI met Professor Bailey,[33] of West Point, on board the boat in which I\r\ncame up the river. He had called the evening previous, when both Dr.\r\nTorrey and myself were out. He informed me that the professorship of\r\nchemistry, etc., was now established by law on the same footing with the\r\nother professorships at West Point, and that the pay of all was\r\nincreased, so that it is now equivalent to that of a major of cavalry;\r\nand more than this: he has been successful in obtaining the place for\r\nhimself. The stage is nearly ready, and I must hasten. Did the doctor\r\nmeet Mr. Herrick? I have been thinking that, as they do not know each\r\nother, the chance of their meeting at the Astor House is but slight. I\r\nmust have given both him and yourself no little trouble with my\r\nexpedition trappings; and if Herrick should conclude to stay at home\r\nafter all, which is not unlikely, we shall lose our labor. However, tell\r\nDr. T. that I will do as much for him whenever he fits out for an\r\nexploring expedition!\r\n\r\nCLEVELAND, OHIO, August. 12, 1838,--\r\nthe 4th day of my pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nEre this reaches you, a letter which I sent to the post-office in\r\nBatavia, New York, will probably have come to hand. The coach called for\r\nme before I had finished, and I was obliged to take my portfolio in my\r\nhand, and finish, seal, and address the letter in the coach during a\r\nmoment’s delay at the stage-office. I arrived at Buffalo a few minutes\r\nafter sunset; stopped at a hotel not very munch smaller than the Astor\r\nHouse, with accommodations scarcely inferior. Learning that a boat was\r\nto leave for Detroit and the intervening ports that evening at eight\r\no’clock I secured a passage. The internal organization of the Bunker\r\nHill (and I believe the other boats on the lake are not materially\r\ndifferent) is rather odd, but very well adapted to answer the purpose\r\nfor which it is intended. All the boats carry large quantities of\r\nfreight, and the whole space beneath the main deck is occupied by\r\nmerchandise, and by the boilers and fuel. The deck is crowded with\r\nboxes, bales, and casks, many of which are directed to places in the far\r\nWest yet so distant that they have hardly commenced their journey. The\r\nafter part is occupied chiefly by a sort of cabin for deck passengers\r\n(equivalent to steerage passengers), in which men, women, and children,\r\nDutch, Irish, Swiss, and Yankee, are promiscuously jumbled. It is\r\ninfinitely better, however, than the steerage of packet-ships. The bow\r\nof the boat is occupied by a different set of passengers, viz., eight or\r\nten horses, destined to draw sundry wagons which now occupy a very\r\nconspicuous situation in front of the promenade-deck. You would suppose\r\nthere was no room left for cabin passengers. On the contrary, their\r\naccommodations, though by no means splendid, are really very comfortable\r\nand complete. They occupy what in a North River boat forms the\r\npromenade-deck, which here extends nearly the whole length of the\r\nvessel, has a ladies’ saloon entirely separate from the gentlemen’s\r\ncabin, and three or four private state-rooms for families. The\r\ngentlemen’s cabin is fitted up with state-rooms with three berths in\r\neach, and as there was only a moderate number of passengers I was so\r\nfortunate as to secure a whole state-room to myself, where I enjoyed\r\nvery comfortable rest. When I rose, we were approaching the town of\r\nErie, Pennsylvania. I made an attempt, while we were detained at the\r\nwharf, to get on shore to botanize: but time would not permit, and I\r\nconsoled myself with the comfortable reflection that the dry and sterile\r\ngravely banks of the lake were not likely to afford me anything worth\r\nthe trouble. We had a strong head wind nearly all day, so that our\r\nprogress was not very rapid: the surface of the lake was covered with\r\nwhite-caps, and the boat pitched so as sadly to disturb the equanimity\r\nof a great part of the passengers. Indeed, although I was at no time\r\nsick, I found it the most prudent course to pass a large portion of the\r\ntime in a recumbent position; and I was heartily glad when, a little\r\nbefore sunset, we came in sight of Cleveland. One or two passengers,\r\ndestined for Detroit, etc., landed to pass the Sabbath here, among whom\r\nwas Mr. Baldwin of Philadelphia, the machinist, a member of Mr. Barnes’\r\nchurch, a very able and interesting man. We are both at the same hotel,\r\nand it being much crowded we occupy rooms which open into each other. I\r\nhad a little time before night-fall to walk through the city (which will\r\nultimately be a very pleasant place, and is now flourishing, but like\r\nmost Western towns in a very unfinished state). The people show some\r\nsigns of civilization: they eat ice-cream, which is sold in many places.\r\nI tried the article and found it very good,--nearly the same as what I\r\nmight just at this moment be enjoying at 30 MacDougal Street, were I now\r\nthere (as I wish I was), for it is more than probable that the notes of\r\nthe peripatetic vender are falling upon your ear. Returning to the hotel\r\nI consulted the city directory, and read an account of the early\r\nsettlement of this portion of the State, which is the famous Western\r\nReserve once owned by Connecticut and settled mostly by citizens of that\r\nState, who brought with them the heretical doctrines and measures which\r\ncaused the expulsion of the Western Reserve synod last year. But the\r\nevening is advancing, and I must break off; and hoping that the\r\napproaching Sabbath may be profitable to both of us and that you may be\r\nblessed with comfortable health and strength to enjoy it, I bid you\r\ngood-night.\r\n\r\nSunday evening.--I attended the First Presbyterian Church this morning,\r\nexpecting to hear Mr. Aikin, the pastor, formerly of Utica; but,\r\ninstead, we heard President McGuffey of Cincinnati College, who is quite\r\na celebrated man in this State.\r\n\r\nDetroit, Tuesday noon.--I improve the first moment I could secure for\r\nthe purpose to continue my letter, hoping to fill the sheet in time for\r\nthe next mail.\r\n\r\nOn Monday (yesterday) morning I went botanizing, but found absolutely\r\nnothing. I kept near the shore of the lake that I might see the first\r\nsteamboat that came in sight, and one was momently expected. It did not\r\narrive, however, until eleven o’clock, and it was a little after noon\r\nbefore we were under way. The wind was very fresh, and the billows of\r\nLake Erie would not have disgraced the Atlantic. It was, however, in our\r\nfavor, and we made good progress; but for about two hours we had to run\r\nin the trough of the sea, so that the boat pitched and rolled sadly. At\r\nsunset we arrived at Sandusky in Ohio. The entrance to the bay is very\r\nbeautiful. The lake is studded with islands of various sizes, all\r\ncovered with trees, with here and there a house or a cultivated field\r\nupon the larger ones. It was dark before we left; the water was still\r\nrough. I went into the cabin and read until it was time to occupy my\r\nberth. I am not sure whether I told you that I had lost Bishop\r\nBerkeley. I left it behind at Avon, where I was too sick to think about\r\nit, but the driver promised me faithfully, for value received, to look\r\nit up and send it to the stage-office at Buffalo, where I may find it on\r\nmy return.\r\n\r\nI was roused this morning just at daybreak. We were just at Detroit. I\r\nestablished myself at a hotel, got my breakfast, and sallied forth to\r\nsurvey the town, which is larger than I supposed and most beautifully\r\nsituated. As soon as I thought your friend, C. W. Whipple,[34] might be\r\nat his office I called to pay my respects and deliver the doctor’s\r\nletter. He was not in; but arrived in a few minutes. He is a\r\ngood-looking man, but I suspect rather older and a good deal fatter than\r\nwhen you knew him. His black hair has a few silver threads mingled with\r\nit, but his countenance is youthful and most thoroughly good-natured. We\r\nhad some conversation; then went to see Dr. Pitcher, but he was not at\r\nhome: thence to Dr. Houghton’s house, which is entirely occupied as a\r\nstore-house for the stuff collected in the State survey. It is\r\nastonishing what a prodigious quantity of labor Dr. H. and his\r\ncompanions have done and what extensive collections they have made. Dr.\r\nH. is not now at home but is expected to-morrow. We went next to the\r\nState-House, but did not find Governor Mason at his office. We looked\r\nthrough the building, at their commencement for a State library, etc.,\r\nwhere we met some of the dignitaries of the State. We ascended into the\r\ncupola which crowns the building, where we have a most beautiful view of\r\nthe town and region round about, the roads all diverging from the\r\ncentre, the noble river, which we could trace from its commencement in\r\nLake St. Clair. The people are evidently very proud of the prospect. By\r\nthe way, I hear that the doctor’s protégé Dr. Fischer has been here, and\r\nhas gone on to Indiana to astonish the people with his new fashion of\r\nblowing up rocks. He has performed wonders in this way between this\r\nplace and New York. Whipple thinks they will have some place for him\r\nnext winter. The university branch in this place has a vacation soon,\r\nand a public examination is now going on; thither we next directed our\r\nsteps. I was introduced to the principal, Mr. Fitch, to whom they give a\r\nsalary of $1500 per annum. I am informed that they employ no teachers or\r\nprincipals in any of the branches without first submitting them to a\r\nthorough examination. We stayed until the examination suspended for\r\ndinner, when I returned to my room, and here you see me\r\nengaged.--Sunset. After dinner Mr. Whipple called for me, and we went to\r\nsee Governor Mason at his house. We were introduced to his sisters....\r\nThey live in a very good house, quite elegantly furnished. We stayed\r\nonly a few minutes, all going to Whipple’s office, where a meeting of\r\nthe board of regents was appointed to be held. It was known that there\r\nwould be no quorum, so they adjourned until Thursday, when Mr. Mundy is\r\nexpected back from New York, and a meeting of consequence will be held.\r\nI was introduced to Chancellor Farnsworth (who wrote me from the\r\ncommittee), Major Kearsley, Judge Brooks (Whipple’s father-in-law) and\r\nothers. We all went to the examination, which was, as usual, very\r\nstupid, and as it closed we stopped in at the Catholic church--cathedral\r\nas it is called--and saw the pictures, of which there are several, some\r\nof them valuable. I was struck with a portrait of St. Peter, a stout\r\nPaddy-looking fellow with a heavy black beard and mustachios,\r\nbare-footed, lugging a pair of keys as large as he could grasp! We\r\nexpect nearly all hands to go to Ann Arbor on Friday. All speak in\r\nglowing terms of the beauty of the location for the university. I had a\r\nfew minutes’ conversation with Whipple as to the plan of buildings,\r\netc., which satisfied me, but I wait for more information before I\r\nattempt to write you about the matter.\r\n\r\nI am, so far, pleased on the whole with the prospects here, and think\r\nthey are more promising than I had at first supposed. I must break off\r\nagain, as I see Governor Mason has come, as he promised, to give me a\r\ncall. I had hoped to conclude and fill the sheet ere this. I find that\r\nwe had the fortune to come through the lake in rather slow vessels.\r\nThere are several upon the lake which make the trip between Buffalo and\r\nDetroit in twenty-six or twenty-seven hours. These are large and really\r\nsplendid boats, carrying little freight, with richly furnished cabins. I\r\nwill try to arrange matters so as to come down one of these boats.\r\nTo-morrow I hope to botanize a little.... Mr. Whipple has also asked me\r\nto take a ride up to the foot of St. Clair Lake. Now I have nearly\r\nfilled this very large sheet, and it is so dark I can hardly see to\r\nfinish. I shall look at the office to-morrow for a letter from home.\r\n\r\nI was asked to-day if I would stay here until toward winter! I said I\r\nhad rather on the whole be excused!\r\n\r\nHow are the girls? I must write to them specially as soon as I can. Does\r\nthe doctor go regularly to market every morning? I hope to get away from\r\nhere early next week. Best remembrances to the doctor. Adieu.\r\n\r\nDETROIT, August 16, 1838.\r\n\r\nMy last letter left here, I suppose, in yesterday morning’s boat, and\r\nwill reach New York in four days. Since its last date nothing whatever\r\nhas transpired here of any interest. Dr. Houghton arrived here yesterday\r\nmorning, and as it was a rainy day I spent near the whole time at his\r\nhouse. He is a very energetic little fellow, and the account of his\r\nadventures in exploring the unsettled portions of the State is very\r\ninteresting. He has slept in a house not more than a dozen nights since\r\nthe commencement of his surveys this season. Mr. Whipple was somewhat\r\nunwell, and. I saw him but for a few minutes. I am now going round to\r\nhis office to read the newspapers, as a mail from New York must have\r\narrived this morning.\r\n\r\nThursday evening.--I spent the whole morning with Mr. Whipple, who is\r\nreally a downright clever fellow in both the English and the Yankee\r\nsenses of the term. We compared notes fully about the university and\r\neverything about the matter we could think of. I obtained all the\r\ninformation he could afford me about what they were doing, and\r\ncontemplated doing. I told him fully what I wished to do, and in\r\neverything I believe we understood each other and agreed wonderfully.\r\nThis is important, because Whipple, although secretary of the board, is\r\nnot a member; yet he is the moving spirit of the whole, and throws his\r\nwhole energy into the work. We owe the plan adopted as to the\r\narrangement of buildings, etc., to him, and he carried it over\r\nconsiderable opposition. As I know it is just what will please the\r\ndoctor I mention it here. It is to have the professor’s houses entirely\r\ndistinct from both the university building and the dormitories of the\r\nstudents. The grounds are nearly square, and are to be entirely\r\nsurrounded by an avenue. He proposes to have a university building for\r\nlecture-rooms, library, laboratory, etc., but to contain no students and\r\nno families; to have two lateral buildings for students and the tutors\r\nwho have the immediate charge of them. Then to build professors’ houses\r\non the other side of the quadrangle, fronting the main building, each\r\nwith about an acre of land for yard and garden, by which the houses will\r\nnot only be away from the students, but at sufficient distance from each\r\nother to render them retired and quiet. It is quite a point with him\r\nthat the professors shall have retired, comfortable houses, so that they\r\nshall be subject to no annoyance. By the way, Whipple informed me to-day\r\nof something that had turned up quite unexpectedly. Your old friend is\r\nabout to be made a judge. The appointment is expected to be made by the\r\nfirst of next month. He is induced to accept this place because it will\r\nrelease him from the drudgery of professional business and give him\r\nnearly six months of leisure each year: which leisure he wishes to\r\ndevote to the interests of the university. This will make him a member\r\nof the board of regents, of which the judges are ex-officio members.\r\n\r\nThere was to be a meeting of the regents this evening; but as\r\nLieutenant-Governor Mundy had not arrived there was no quorum. It seems\r\nthat Mundy has not managed well, and has allowed the plans to be\r\ndelayed, and Davis, instead of sending the plan he promised, is coming\r\nout here to see for himself. So it is probable the plans will not all be\r\nin for a month or so. Chancellor Farnsworth, the chairman of the\r\ncommittee appointed to confer with me, called to-day, but I was out. I\r\nsaw him this evening. Whipple had repeated to him the substance of my\r\nconversation with him, and I am desired to commit my plans to writing,\r\nthat he may embody it in his report at the next meeting of the regents.\r\nThis I am to do to-morrow (D. V.) and to call on the chancellor\r\nto-morrow evening, with Whipple, to talk over the matter. There is every\r\nreason to believe that my propositions will be adopted. I say nothing\r\nabout the subject of salary, and avoid the matter’s being broached until\r\nthe rest is settled. I shall leave it for them to propose. If they\r\nemploy me, according to the plan I shall present, they can’t well avoid\r\noffering to pay me handsomely. Prospective appointments will be offered\r\nerelong (the coming fall or early in winter) to Professor Henry,\r\nProfessor Torrey, and perhaps one or two others. Whipple expressed a\r\ndesire to attempt to secure Professor Douglass[35] for the department of\r\nengineering, etc. Everything looks well. The board are determined to\r\nprescribe a course of studies and training which shall bring the school\r\nup at once to the highest standard. I do not think that there exists\r\nanother board of regents in the country that will compare with this for\r\nenergy and capability. But I must break off, as I have a pretty\r\nimportant lecture to prepare to-morrow. I am afraid that these long\r\nletters, in which I set down everything that happens from morning to\r\nnight, will prove very tiresome to you; but I have nothing else to write\r\nabout. I am anxious to get through, when I will return as fast as\r\nsteamboats and railroads will carry me.\r\n\r\nANN ARBOR, August 20.\r\n\r\nI snatch the few moments that are left me ere the arrival of the stage\r\nthat is to take me to Detroit to complete my journal. I broke off, I\r\nthink, late on Thursday evening. On Friday I kept close to my room until\r\nI had finished my letter to Chancellor Farnsworth. I sallied out about 4\r\nP.M., showed my letter to Whipple, who approved it altogether and\r\ninsisted upon our calling on the governor and showing it to him, in\r\norder that he might drive the committee a little, if it should be\r\nnecessary. The servant told us his Excellency was not at home, but\r\nWhipple insisted upon his looking into his private room, before he was\r\ntoo confident. And there sure enough we found him. Mason will be down\r\nerelong to take a wife. With his approval, the letter was sent round to\r\nthe chancellor. Whipple, Pitcher, Houghton, and myself spent the evening\r\nat the chancellor’s residence, a very pretty place. Mrs. Farnsworth is\r\nvery ladylike and agreeable. Both the chancellor and his lady are from\r\nVermont, and are more than usually intelligent. In the morning I started\r\nalone for Ann Arbor,--thirty miles by railroad, and ten (the road not\r\nbeing completed) by stagecoach. I left Detroit at nine A.M. (after going\r\nto the post office and being much disappointed and grieved to find no\r\nletter,--please tell the doctor so), and reached this place about noon.\r\nThe location is really delightful, and in a very few years it will be\r\nthe prettiest possible place for a residence. But I must reserve all\r\nparticulars until I see you, if I am allowed that pleasure; for although\r\nthere is an attempt to keep me here until after the arrival of Mr.\r\nDavis, the architect, who is to be here in about ten days, yet I am\r\nanxious, deeply anxious, to get back again. If I wait his arrival I\r\nshall necessarily be detained here until about the 10th of September. It\r\nwould be desirable on many accounts, but--I don’t mean to stay.\r\n\r\nThe grounds for the university are very prettily situated. The only\r\npossible fault I can imagine is that they are too level. I have\r\ncontrived a plan for the arrangement of the grounds which gives\r\nsatisfaction to the members of the board here, and I think will suit\r\nall. I brought letters to Chief Justice Fletcher and Judge Wilkins. I\r\nspent the evening at Dr. Denton’s, one of the regents, with several\r\ngentlemen and ladies, married and unmarried. It having been ascertained\r\nthat I was unmarried, it was suggested that I might possibly lose my\r\nheart; but I assure you I was never in less danger. On Sunday attended\r\nthe Presbyterian church here. The pastor, an amiable and very pious old\r\nman, was to preach his last sermon to-day, the people having grown too\r\nwise for their teachers. His morning discourse from the text, “Christ\r\ncommended his love to us in that while we were yet sinners,” etc.,--a\r\nvery good sermon. In the afternoon his farewell discourse was from Acts\r\nxx. 32, and did honor to his heart. (The stage is ready.) At twilight I\r\nin fancy transported myself to 30 MacDougal Street, where yourself, the\r\ndoctor, and the children were singing your evening hymns. I sang to\r\nmyself, as well as I could, all the hymns you were singing, as I\r\nsupposed, and wished myself with you. This morning I have been\r\nbotanizing, and have cured for the doctor some specimens (clusters of\r\nEshcol) of this goodly land. So be prepared for a very favorable report.\r\nMy pen is abominable, and I have not another moment.\r\n\r\n(DETROIT), 8.30, Monday evening, August 20.\r\n\r\nA pleasant afternoon ride brought me back again to this place, where my\r\nfirst care was to run to the post office, nothing doubting that I should\r\nfind a letter; but I was wofully disappointed, and yet it is the 20th of\r\nthe month! This is too bad. Do beseech the doctor to write; and\r\nespecially if I should be detained here until the fourth or fifth day of\r\nnext month, as I fear may be necessary, ask him to write every other day\r\nuntil you hear from me again.\r\n\r\nI am glad to get back here again on one account. The fare here, which is\r\nno great matter, I assure you, is excellent compared with the hotel at\r\nAnn Arbor. Indeed, I have not taken my place at a single dinner-table\r\nfor ten days without being reminded of Charles Lamb and his memorable\r\nessay on Roast Pig. Here he might riot in his favorite dish (which is in\r\nmy opinion wretched stuff), as one of the aforesaid juvenile quadrupeds,\r\nwith a sprig of parsley in his mouth, has been regularly presented to my\r\neyes ever since I left the State of New York. I am sadly bothered as to\r\nthe course I should take. I suppose I might be able to leave here on\r\nThursday of this week, and, staying over Sabbath at Oswego (making no\r\nstay at the Falls), arrive at my father’s Tuesday evening, and at New\r\nYork on Friday morning. But before I could reach New York, Mr. Davis,\r\naccording to his appointment, would be at Detroit, and it is possible\r\nthat a very few days would enable us to settle almost everything about\r\nthe arrangement of the grounds, the internal disposition of the\r\nuniversity building, and the plan of professors’ houses. I feel so\r\nstrong a hope that the doctor will be persuaded to take a professorship\r\nthat I have fixed upon the place for his house, should my plan for the\r\narrangement of the grounds be adopted. And I am very desirous to return\r\nto you with the plans in my hands, that I may submit them to Dr. T.,\r\nProf. Henry, etc., in time to correct our mistakes and suggest\r\nimprovements. I see also that if I leave now (although I have explained\r\nthat I made arrangements on leaving to be back by the first of\r\nSeptember, and that it is very necessary I should return by that time),\r\nI should lose much of the influence I have acquired, and it is more than\r\nprobable that some error would be committed that we should not see in\r\ntime to rectify.\r\n\r\nI am anxious that the proper means should be adopted to supply the\r\nuniversity and houses with water in abundance, and at such a level that\r\nit can be taken into the second story of the professors’ houses; I think\r\nyou may imagine one reason why I am so solicitous about this matter. I\r\nwas pleased to find on my arrival here that this subject had already\r\nreceived much attention, and there is a determination, on the part of\r\nnearly all the regents I have conversed with, to effect this object at\r\nwhatever expense. Of the different plans in contemplation only one, I\r\nthink, will effectually answer the purpose. I have some hope that the\r\nsubject will be acted upon at the first meeting after Mr. Davis arrives.\r\nBefore that time I suspect we shall not be able to secure the quorum\r\nnecessary for the transaction of this and other matters of business. I\r\nhope also to secure an appropriation for the library, and philosophical\r\nand chemical apparatus. I feel pretty confident of accomplishing this\r\nresult by early autumn.\r\n\r\nThis is my last entire sheet of large paper, so you may expect no more\r\nsuch tedious letters, unless I find more like it. But if I do not hear\r\nfrom you, and that speedily, I shall be very unhappy. Ask Dr. T. to open\r\nany letters that may have come from Norfolk or Washington, and apprise\r\nme of the contents, or take any steps that become necessary. Adieu, my\r\ndear friend. May our Heavenly Father bless and keep you and yours is the\r\nsincere prayer of your attached,\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO DR. TROWBRIDGE.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, October 1, 1838.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,--My arrangements are now so far completed that I may say,\r\nwith as much confidence as we may speak of any event subject to ordinary\r\ncontingencies, that I hope to sail for London on the first of next\r\nmonth. I am of course hard at work; there is no need to tell you that.\r\nThe second part of “Flora” we hope, by hard work, to have published\r\nabout the 20th inst.\r\n\r\nYours truly,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, November 7, 1838.\r\n\r\nI expect to sail to-morrow for Liverpool in the packet-ship\r\nPennsylvania, unless the weather should prove unfavorable, which is not\r\nunlikely. The sailing has already been postponed one day, much to my\r\nrelief, as, although I have not taken off my clothes for two nights, I\r\nam not yet quite ready. I hope to get everything in order before I\r\nsleep. You can write to me readily at any time.\r\n\r\nI have worked very hard for a few weeks past, but I shall now have a\r\nfine time to rest. I am in very good health and spirits.\r\n\r\nMrs. Torrey has a fine boy a few weeks old, and is doing well. Kind\r\nremembrances to all, in haste,\r\n\r\nGood-by,\r\nA. G.\r\n\r\nTO HIS MOTHER.\r\n\r\nSHIP PENNSYLVANIA, 9th November, 1838.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MOTHER,--These few lines will be sent on shore in a few minutes\r\nby the pilot, and will soon reach you. We shall be out of sight of land\r\nin less than two hours more, with a fine breeze. The ship has some\r\nmotion, but I am not at all sick yet. We have a fine ship and every\r\nprospect of a speedy voyage. I shall write at once from Liverpool.\r\nGood-by again to all. Letters are called for. Good-by; remember me in\r\nyour prayers.\r\n\r\nYour affectionate son,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFIRST JOURNEY IN EUROPE.\r\n\r\n1838-1839.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been deemed expedient to give a somewhat fuller narrative of Dr.\r\nGray’s first visit to Europe than of his subsequent ones. It was then\r\nthat he formed many personal acquaintances which ripened into lifelong\r\nfriendships, and received his first impressions of scenes in nature and\r\nart which were to become very familiar. His letters home took the form\r\nof a very detailed journal, and it is in extracts from this journal,\r\nsupplemented by letters to other friends, that this narrative consists.\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\nADELPHI HOTEL, LIVERPOOL, 12 M., December 1, 1838.\r\n\r\nWe came up the Channel with a gentle breeze, and anchored at half-past\r\nnine. At ten minutes past ten I set my feet on the soil (or rather the\r\nstone) of Old England. We were very fortunate in our ship, having made\r\nour voyage in twenty-one days; while the England (in which, you may\r\nremember, I once had intended to sail), which left New York on the first\r\nof November, came to anchor just ten minutes before us (thirty days).\r\nThe Garrick, which sailed on the twenty-fifth of October, arrived here\r\nonly on Saturday. I must close this letter early in the morning....\r\n\r\nEvening.--This short English day has been occupied in good part in\r\ngetting my luggage from the ship and through the custom house. I sallied\r\nout a little past nine in the morning; went first of all to a tailor and\r\nordered a coat (which is to be finished and delivered this evening);\r\nthen dispatched my letters for home by the United States; found our own\r\nship just going into dock (what docks they are! but as we have always\r\nplenty of water we do not so much need them in New York); arranged my\r\nluggage, and then proceeded all hands to the custom house (a large new\r\nbuilding, rather imposing in appearance), where I was detained until\r\npast three o’clock. I had fifteen pounds of books to pay duty upon\r\n(fifteen shillings), and nothing to complain of as to the manner of the\r\nexamination.... After dinner, visited the market, which on Saturday\r\nevening is full and busy. It is about twice the size of all the New York\r\nmarkets put together, and a sight well worth seeing. I examined\r\neverything scrutinizingly, but will not trouble you with my\r\nobservations....\r\n\r\nSunday evening, December 2.--Went this morning to the chapel of the\r\nschool for the blind. The chanting and singing was very fine, and the\r\nsight an interesting one. But to me the solemnity of the church service\r\nis by no means increased by being chanted; heard a tolerable sermon. In\r\nthe evening heard Dr. Raffles.[36] His chapel is a gloomy structure\r\nexternally, but very neat and comfortable within. Dr. R. preached the\r\nfirst of a series of discourses “On the most remarkable events in the\r\nearly history of the Israelites,” commencing with the bondage in Egypt,\r\nwhich was the subject this evening; a very good sermon, delivered in an\r\nimpressive (but rather pompous) manner. I am very anxious to get to\r\nGlasgow. I have been living in society, for the last three weeks, by no\r\nmeans to my taste, and most of them are still here. It is not very\r\npleasant to spend a Sabbath alone at a hotel; but I suppose I must needs\r\nbecome accustomed to it.\r\n\r\nI was not fully aware, until yesterday, how much cause we had for\r\nthankfulness at our safe arrival. The gales which we encountered off the\r\nIrish coast have caused a great number of shipwrecks, and it is feared\r\nthat many lives are lost. The England escaped most narrowly.\r\n\r\nFeather’s Inn, Chester, Monday evening.--I have, my dear friend, the\r\nsingular pleasure of writing and addressing to you another leaf of my\r\njournal from a city which was founded, according to the directory which\r\nlies before me, “in the year, 917 B.C., at which time Jehosaphat and\r\nAhab governed Israel and Judah,”--the only walled and fortified city in\r\nEngland of which the walls are yet in a state of preservation. The city\r\nwas rebuilt by Julius Cæsar, and was an important Roman station; and\r\nthere yet remain many vestiges of Roman occupancy; a hypocaust is still\r\nto be seen under the hotel in which I am now staying,--so it is said,\r\nfor I have not yet seen it, having arrived here after dark. But I expect\r\nto be very much interested in this queer old town, for which I owe\r\nthanks to Dr. Torrey, since it was his recommendation that induced me to\r\ncome here. I have scampered about the streets this evening, bought some\r\nlithographic views, studied the directory, and am prepared for a busy\r\nday between Chester and Eaton Hall, should I live till to-morrow. But\r\nit is time I should tell you briefly how I got here. This morning soon\r\nafter breakfast I walked out to the Botanic Garden, delivered a note of\r\nintroduction to Shepherd,[37] who received me rather politely, inquired\r\nafter Dr. Torrey, and showed me through the greenhouses. The\r\nestablishment is not where it was when Dr. T. was here, but was removed\r\nfurther out of town, two or three years ago. The garden occupies eleven\r\nacres; the site is well chosen; but being newly planted there is of\r\ncourse little to see. The hothouses are very well, but not extensive;\r\nthe collections not particularly interesting, except for some old plants\r\nthat have belonged to the establishment many years.\r\n\r\nI took my cloak and umbrella (necessary articles these!), and at 3 P.M.\r\ncrossed the Mersey in a small uncomfortable black steamboat, about as\r\nmuch inferior to our Hoboken or Brooklyn ferry-boats as a Barnegat\r\nwood-schooner is to a packet-ship; and at Birkenhead took an outside\r\nseat for Chester (ten miles), though it rained often and blew hard and\r\ncold; had a good view of the country until about five miles from\r\nChester, when it grew dark; saw little villages, farm-houses and\r\ncottages, cows, etc., all of which is much more interesting to me than\r\nthe smoky town of Liverpool. I have seen several little things that are\r\nnew to me. Let us see what I can recollect at the moment. Hedges of\r\nholly--those I am pleased with, particularly when sheared and clipped.\r\nThe prettiest fence is a stone wall over-topped with a close hedge of\r\nholly. Ivy in profusion covering great walls, trees, etc., etc.,--we\r\nhave nothing to compare with it; a flock of rooks,--very like crows,\r\nbut larger; an English stagecoach,--more of that anon; a coach and four\r\nwith postilions,--fine. But I must stop here.\r\n\r\nP. S.--Liverpool again, Tuesday evening.--I have accomplished a good\r\nday’s work to-day. Rose early, made the circuit of the city of Chester\r\non the walls before breakfast, explored all about the town; visited the\r\ncathedral, walked to Eaton Hall, four miles and back again; and then,\r\nfinding there was no coach in the morning until nine o’clock, took an\r\nevening coach, and returned here ten P.M., much gratified, but a little\r\nfatigued; so good-night. A. G.\r\n\r\nGLASGOW (WOODSIDE CRESCENT), December 12, 1838.\r\n\r\nI do not just now feel like a traveler. I have been for almost a week,\r\nif not at home, yet the next thing to it, in the truly hospitable\r\nmansion of our good friends here, where I was received with that cordial\r\nkindness which you, having experienced before me, can well understand.\r\nIndeed I owe it chiefly to you, who I assure you are not forgotten here.\r\nEcce signum. Both Sir William and Lady Hooker call me, oftener than\r\nanything else, by the name of Dr. Torrey. I answer to the name promptly,\r\nand am much flattered to be your representative.\r\n\r\nI have just stuck fast here, busy among the plants from morning till\r\nnight. I have been out of the house but twice (except to church on\r\nSunday): once a walk into town with Mr. Hooker, Senior (kind and amiable\r\nold man, who insists upon taking me about, and showing me whatever he\r\nshowed you), and once with Sir William to the Botanic Garden. I am\r\nanxious to improve every moment here, where there is so much to be done\r\nand such ample means. Arnott has written, inviting me to spend some time\r\nwith him, which I hope to do, visiting him from Edinburgh, there being\r\nnow no coach to Stirling or Kinross, from Glasgow direct.... Sir William\r\nhas given me many interesting plants; we have settled many points of\r\ninterest. He had our new Nuttallia all figured for the Supplement to\r\n“Flora Borealis Americana” as a new genus, and we have recently found it\r\namong plants from the Snake country, which, with Douglas’s and other\r\nCalifornian plants, he is publishing as a supplement to “Beechey’s\r\nVoyage.” I begged him to adopt the name Nuttallia. He offered at once to\r\npublish it as of Torrey and Gray, but I would not consent to this, and I\r\nam sure you would agree with me. He has in different ways a great share\r\nof Nuttall’s so far,--Pickeringia for instance (which is a shrubby\r\nBaptisia), Kentrophyta, etc. I shall be kept here ten days longer, I\r\nthink; no one else abroad is so rich in North American botany or takes\r\nso much interest in it. I am requested to study all his Sandwich Island\r\nplants (including my own parcel here), and make an article for the\r\n“Annals of Natural History” while here. I think I will, if on looking\r\nover the parcels I think I can do the subject justice. Can’t\r\nKnieskern[38] safely make the excursion to Sante Fé in the coming\r\nspring? If he can, and will work hard, he will make $1000 clear of\r\nexpenses! All the collectors make money. Hooker is very anxious about\r\nit. I hope to find the fifty copies of “Flora” at Wiley & Putnam’s on\r\nreaching London. I hope you have seen the partner at New York on the\r\nsubject, and that the “Flora” will be advertised fully in London before\r\nI reach there. But I must close. Don’t fail to write very often. Sir\r\nWilliam and Lady Hooker and all the family, old, young, and middle-aged,\r\nall send their most affectionate regards. I sit over against your\r\nportrait at dinner. It is very like you....\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nKINROSS, Wednesday evening, January 2, 1839.\r\n\r\nMy journal will inform you of all my movements and doings, and also of\r\nthe arrival of your welcome letter by the Liverpool, while I remained at\r\nSir William’s. I am much distressed at the thought of your anticipated\r\nengagements with Princeton, and wish very much that you could have felt\r\nyourself warranted in delaying until after the expected meeting of the\r\nregents of the Michigan university, which was to take place on the 10th\r\nof December. While there is the slightest hope remaining I do not like\r\nto relinquish the thought that we may hereafter work together and live\r\nnear each other. The fear that this may not be the case has of late\r\nrendered me much more anxious to obtain books and specimens, in order\r\nthat I may get on by myself in case I shall be compelled to work alone.\r\nI need not attempt to tell you how much I have enjoyed my visit to\r\nHooker. He is truly one of Nature’s noblemen. We worked very hard for\r\ntwenty days, and I would have been glad to have stayed as much longer;\r\nfor as yet I have looked into few books. All the collections of Carex\r\nplaced in Boott’s hands have been returned to Hooker, and I assisted\r\nhim in arranging them and selecting for his herbarium; in the course of\r\nwhich I have obtained specimens of nearly all the Northern and Oregonian\r\nones, including one or two which have come in recently, of which I have,\r\nwhen there were duplicates, specimens also for you. The return numbers\r\nof those sent you were in many cases strangely misplaced, and Boott has\r\noften been sadly confounded. He has studied the genus very critically,\r\nhypercritically I may say; for he makes new species where we should\r\nthink there were too many already. We went over Hooker’s Grasses in the\r\nsame way, and I have obtained numerous specimens and much useful\r\ninformation which we shall presently require. On Christmas day Joseph\r\nHooker selected from a large Van Dieman’s Land collection a suite of\r\nspecimens as far as they have been studied (to Calycifloræ), in which\r\nthere is in almost every instance a specimen for each of us....\r\n\r\nIn looking over the recent collections from the Snake country, and\r\nDouglas’s Californian, I recognized a great portion of Nuttall’s,[39]\r\nbut by no means all. There was a single specimen of Kentrophyta in\r\nexcellent fruit; another of Astrophia, with neither flower or fruit,\r\ncollected long ago by Scouler and mixed in with a species of Hosackia,\r\nto which genus I am not sure that it is not nearly allied. Nuttall has\r\nmade too many Hosackias! The copy of “Flora,” with my notes, has gone\r\nround to London, so that I cannot now communicate many curious things\r\nnoted in the second part. But how did we overlook the Hosackia\r\ncrassifolia twice over! I am glad you have the fruit of Chapmannia. I am\r\na little afraid of Stylosanthes, of which there is a sort of monograph\r\nby Vogel in the current volume of the “Linnæa;” but no plurifoliate ones\r\nappear. Hooker has a curious new genus of Chenopodiaceæ, from the Rocky\r\nMountains, figured for the “Icones,” which he wishes to call Grayia! I\r\nam quite content with a Pig-weed; and this is a very queer one.\r\n\r\nAt Glasgow, although my stay was prolonged to twenty days, I was unable\r\nin that time to accomplish all I wished with Hooker; and you may be sure\r\nwe lost no time, and that I could spare very little to visit those\r\nobjects of interest passing by. I did not omit, however, as you may well\r\nsuppose, to visit the High Church (the old Cathedral), where I spent an\r\ninteresting hour, having contrived to go there alone that I might enjoy\r\nmyself in my own way. From this I visited the new cemetery, which\r\noccupies the summit of a hill adjacent to and overlooking the Cathedral.\r\nOn the very summit, raised on a tall column, is a colossal figure of old\r\nJohn Knox in the attitude of preaching, but ever and anon he seems to\r\ncast a scowling look down upon the Cathedral, as if he were inclined to\r\nmake another attempt to demolish its walls. And well he might, for if\r\nwhat I hear be true, I fancy he would find the preaching now heard\r\nwithin its walls almost as destitute of savor as when the shrine of the\r\nVirgin Mary occupied its place in the chapel which bears her name. The\r\nCathedral is now undergoing some repairs; the seats, etc., for the\r\nchurch which occupied the nave are taken away, so that the fine nave\r\npresents nearly the original appearance. But the crypt, said to be the\r\nfinest in the kingdom, is now closed and the key in the possession of\r\nan architect at Edinburgh, so that I could not obtain admittance. It was\r\nin this place, perchance you may recollect, that the first meeting of\r\nRob Roy with Osbaldistone took place. My Scotch reminiscences have been\r\ngreatly revived to-day. To-day I have for the first time seen and\r\ntasted--only tasted--the two Scotch national dishes, viz., singed\r\nsheep’s head and a haggis!\r\n\r\nI had arranged to leave Glasgow on the morning after Christmas, when Sir\r\nWilliam insisted on my staying at least over Wednesday to sit for my\r\nportrait! I contrived, however, to sit on Tuesday (Christmas day), when\r\nI was done in about four hours, in the same style as Sir William’s other\r\nbotanical portraits, and with so much success that it was unanimously\r\nproclaimed to be a most striking likeness; in fact the most successful\r\nof all the artist’s attempts are said to be this and that of Dr. Torrey,\r\nby whose side, it seems, I am destined to be suspended!--a compliment\r\nwith which I may well feel highly gratified. I believe it is a capital\r\nlikeness.\r\n\r\nI dined out only once at Glasgow, at the house of Mr. Davidson, a very\r\nrich don who has made all his money in business here.\r\n\r\nLate in the day I went into town to secure a place in the early coach\r\nfor Stirling and also a bed for the night, as well as to select some\r\nlittle Christmas presents for the Misses Hooker. In the evening Sir\r\nWilliam had several friends to dinner, and soon after the breaking up of\r\nthe evening party I took my leave of these kind friends with no small\r\nregret; my contemplated visit of ten days has been prolonged to just\r\ntwice that number. And now, as we have fairly bid adieu to the old\r\nyear, I must also bid good-by to you for the present, wishing you, not\r\nas the mere compliment of the season, but with all my heart and soul,--a\r\nhappy New Year. The last New Year I well remember; several of its\r\npredecessors also I have had the pleasure of spending with you. I pray\r\nGod we may be preserved and have a happy meeting before another new year\r\ncomes.\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\nKINROSS, Wednesday Evening, January 2, 1839.\r\n\r\nI left Glasgow at seven o’clock A.M. on the morning of the 26th\r\nDecember, on the top of a stage-coach bound for Stirling, so famous in\r\nsong and story,--distant about thirty miles from Glasgow. I arrived\r\nabout half past ten, in the midst of a heavy rain.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Stirling for Perth, I took an inside place, as the storm\r\nstill continued, but it shortly cleared up, and I rode on the outside\r\nnearly the whole journey. The only place worth noticing, or rather which\r\nI have time to notice, through which we passed was Dumblane, which is\r\njust one of those dirty Scotch villages which defy description. If\r\n“Jessie the flower of Dumblane” lived in one of these comfortless and\r\nwretched hovels I’ll warrant her charms are much overpraised in the\r\nsong. Here I saw for the first time a genuine ruin; that of the large\r\nand once important Cathedral, founded in 1142. During the short-lived\r\nestablishment of Episcopacy in Scotland I think that the good Leighton\r\nwas for a time rector of Dumblane. Just beyond Dumblane we passed the\r\nfield of Sheriff-muir, and beyond this, at the little village of Ardoch,\r\nI passed, without being aware at the time, the finest and most entire\r\nRoman camp in Britain; we passed some fine country-seats on the road;\r\nhad a long way the distant Grampian Hills, on which “my father fed his\r\nflocks,” in full view; and somewhat late in a fine moonlight evening, I\r\narrived at Perth. As the stage which passed Arlary left Perth at nine\r\no’clock in the morning, and I could not afford to spend a day here, I of\r\ncourse saw little of this famous town.... A pleasant ride brought me to\r\nArlary at eleven o’clock A.M., and Arnott was by the roadside awaiting\r\nmy arrival. I was sorry to learn that he is not a general favorite among\r\nhis brother botanists; but although most of them possess greater\r\nadvantages, he has but one superior in Great Britain, and in most\r\ndepartments very few equals. He received me with great kindness, and I\r\nhave spent a few days with him very pleasantly indeed. He is a hearty,\r\ngood fellow, and improves vastly on acquaintance. I was exceedingly\r\npleased with Mrs. Arnott, who is exceedingly amiable and lively. On\r\nSunday it stormed terribly, so that we were unable to leave the house.\r\nOn Tuesday I dined with Mr. and Mrs. Arnott, Mr. Wemyss, the clergyman\r\nof the parish, another clergyman, etc., at Mr. Barclay’s, Arnott’s\r\nfather-in-law, about six miles from Arlary. About one o’clock to-day,\r\ntaking leave of Mrs. A. I rode with Arnott to Kinross, and leaving\r\nArnott to write some letters at the hotel in the mean time, I took a\r\nboat to Loch Leven Castle,--the prison of the lovely and ill-fated Mary\r\nQueen of Scots....\r\n\r\nOn returning to the hotel I found that Arnott had picked up the dominie\r\nof his parish, and had our dinner in readiness. The expected coach\r\narrived soon after, but was crowded. I am consequently obliged to wait\r\nfor the mail which passes about two o’clock in the morning, and by\r\nwhich, if I am so fortunate as to obtain a seat, I may expect to reach\r\nEdinburgh before daybreak.\r\n\r\nWATERLOO HOTEL, EDINBURGH,\r\nThursday evening, January. 3, 1839.\r\n\r\nThis is my first day in Auld Reekie; and my first business, on sitting\r\ndown by my quiet and comfortable fireside, shall be to give you a brief\r\naccount of this day’s work. After taking a reasonable modicum of tea I\r\nspent the whole of last evening at Kinross in writing, until two\r\no’clock, at which hour the mail-coach punctually made its appearance;\r\nand there was fortunately room inside. We drew up at the post office at\r\nEdinburgh at half past six in the morning (raining as usual). I took\r\npossession of a very comfortable, even elegant room, very different from\r\nthe six feet by nine bedrooms of most hotels. This is the finest hotel I\r\nhave yet seen; the Adelphi at Liverpool is not to be mentioned in\r\ncomparison. I threw myself on the bed and slept for an hour or two. On\r\nwaking I drew up the curtains of my windows, and had all at once a\r\nmagnificent view of this picturesque city, which startled me. From\r\ndescriptions and a few prints I have somewhere seen I find I had formed\r\na very correct view of this city, as far as it went. It is the finest\r\ntown I have seen or expect soon to see. It owes much of its beauty to\r\nits peculiar site, and to the manner in which the old town acts as a\r\nfoil to the new. Immediately after breakfast I sallied forth, walked\r\ndown the street, uncertain which of my letters of introduction I should\r\nfirst attempt to deliver; decided for Greville;[40] so I crossed the\r\nNorth Bridge, which is thrown not over a river but over a part of the\r\ntown, into the old town, crossed High Street, passed the huge block of\r\nbuildings occupied by the university, plain and heavy without, but the\r\nspacious court within very imposing; and a few minutes’ walk brought me\r\nto Dr. Greville’s residence, which looks in front upon a large public\r\nsquare, and on the other the green fields extend up almost to the\r\nhouse,--a complete rus in urbe. Dr. Greville received me very kindly,\r\nand seemed well pleased to receive Dr. Torrey’s letter; made many\r\naffectionate inquiries, and urged me to stay with him while I remained\r\nin town. I was predetermined to decline all invitations of this kind in\r\nEdinburgh, but found I could give no reasons for doing so that would not\r\nseem strange. Dr. Greville said he well knew I should be obliged to stay\r\neither with him or Dr. Graham,[41] who would never let me off; so, as I\r\nthought Dr. Greville would prove the most useful and edifying\r\nacquaintance, I accepted his invitation and promised to send my luggage\r\nsometime to-morrow. We set out to call on Professor Graham; walked over\r\ninto the New Town, the squares, rows, terraces, and crescents all very\r\nfine; called at Professor G.’s, who was as usual out; left Dr. Torrey’s\r\nletter and my own card. Left to myself again, after promising to meet\r\nDr. Greville at dinner at the house of a friend of his, I directed my\r\nsteps to the Castle, which, crowning a high cliff much like that of\r\nStirling, nearly or quite perpendicular except on one side, is visible\r\nfrom almost every part of the city.... Walked far away to Inverleith\r\nTerrace to leave my letters for Mr. Nicoll;[42] returned, dressed for\r\ndinner, passed an agreeable humdrum evening at a small family party;\r\nreturned to the hotel, read two American newspapers (little news), found\r\na good fire in my room, and sat down to make these desultory notes. As\r\nto all the rest of what I have seen I may have more to say another day.\r\nGood-night!\r\n\r\nST. GEORGE’S SQUARE, 12 M., January 4, 1839.\r\n\r\nBefore I retire to rest I must hastily and very briefly record my doings\r\nto-day, just by way of keeping in good habits; as I am engaged to\r\nbreakfast at an early hour with Dr. Graham I must soon go to bed. Rose\r\nat half past nine (recollect I had not slept the previous night),--a\r\nsnowstorm. Sight-seeing being out of the question, went to the\r\nuniversity, just in time to hear the latter part of Dr. Hope’s lecture\r\n(Light Carburetted Hydrogen and Safety Lamp); fine-studied and rather\r\nformal manner,--did not wear his gown or ruffles at the wrist!\r\nExperiments few but rather neat. In cutting off flame with wire gauze he\r\nvaried the experiment in a way I had not previously seen, viz., by\r\nthrowing a jet of ether upon the gauze, which burnt below but did not\r\nkindle above,--a very pretty effect. He looks to be not above\r\nsixty-five, although he must be ten years over that age. Next heard\r\nProfessor Forbes,[43] a handsome man of very elegant appearance; a most\r\nelegant and lucid lecturer; delivered my note of introduction from\r\nProfessor Silliman; received me very kindly, but I was obliged to leave\r\nat once to hear a lecture from Professor Wilson, the famous Christopher\r\nNorth, one of the most extraordinary men living, very eccentric, a\r\ngifted genius, and a man of the most wonderful versatility of powers.\r\nThe subject to-day was the Association of Ideas. The lecture was rather\r\nstriking, original in manner, with a few flights of that peculiar\r\neloquence which you would expect from Christopher North. Next heard Dr.\r\nMonro (Anatomy); very prosy; the class behaved shockingly, even for\r\nmedical students! Lastly I heard Professor Jameson[44] a stiff,\r\nungainly, forbidding-looking man, who gave us the most desperately dull,\r\ndoleful lecture I ever heard. It was just like a copious table of\r\ncontents to a book,--just about as interesting as reading a table of\r\ncontents for an hour would be; I may add just as instructive! Dined in a\r\nquiet way with Dr. Pardie, a young physician to whom I brought a letter\r\nfrom James Hogg; his wife is a cousin of James; went from the table to\r\nthe college to hear a botanical lecture from Professor Graham; returned\r\nto tea and spent the evening. I found I had quite unexpectedly met with\r\nprofitable acquaintance, as Dr. and Mrs. Pardie were active and ardent\r\nChristians, of the Baptist persuasion, and people of a very delightful\r\nspirit. They were well acquainted with Mr. Cheever of Salem, who spent\r\nsome time in Edinburgh previous to his journey to Palestine. I passed a\r\nvery pleasant evening, and promised to call on them again before leaving\r\ntown. Returned in the midst of a violent snowstorm to Dr. Greville’s,\r\nwhere I am now domesticated, having sent up my baggage from the hotel.\r\n\r\nSaturday evening.--Rose this morning at half past seven; and at half\r\npast eight, according to engagement, went over to the other side of the\r\ntown with Dr. Greville, to breakfast with Dr. Graham, and then visit the\r\nBotanical Garden (deep snow). We looked about the garden, or rather the\r\ngreenhouses, until afternoon; much gratified with the splendid\r\ncollections; but the Sabbath draws nigh, and I cannot go on to tell you\r\nmore about it now. Called on Mr. Nicoll on my return; made a provisional\r\nengagement to meet him at breakfast on Monday and examine his sections\r\nof woods. Ran about the streets; left a note at the house of Arnott’s\r\nbrother, to make arrangements (as we have done) for visiting Parliament\r\nHouse, etc., on Monday; returned to Greville’s, dressed for dinner, and\r\nlooked over books, etc., until Professor Graham and Dr. Balfour,[45]\r\nsecretary of the Botanical Society, arrived; dined; passed a pleasant\r\nevening; after family worship had a little conversation with Dr.\r\nGreville, retired to my room, and now, as I am at the bottom of the page\r\nand my watch says ten minutes to twelve,--to bed. Adieu.\r\n\r\nMonday evening.--Two days have passed since I have taken up my pen to\r\ncommunicate to you my little diary. I still remain domesticated at Dr.\r\nGreville’s, where I am received with the greatest kindness, and am as\r\nhappy as I can be away from home. I like Dr. G. and family much, there\r\nis so much true Christian feeling and simplicity. Dr. G. seems much to\r\nregret that he was unable to meet Dr. Torrey in Edinburgh. Yesterday was\r\nthe first Sabbath of the new year, and I heard two sermons adapted to\r\nthe season; one in the morning, in an Episcopal chapel (the one to\r\nwhich this family belong) from Mr. Drummond, the text being the latter\r\nclause of Hebrews viii. 13; a most excellent, faithful, and godly\r\nsermon. In the afternoon I occupied a seat Dr. Greville was so kind as\r\nto secure for me in the Old Greyfriars (Scotch) Church, which is so\r\ncrowded that without this precaution you can hardly expect to get into\r\nthe church when Dr. Guthrie preaches. He is the most striking preacher I\r\never heard. I could not help comparing him with Whitfield. The text was\r\nthe first clause of Eccles. ii. 11. I dare not attempt to give you any\r\nidea of the discourse. I wish you could have heard it. In this\r\nchurch-yard the remains of the early martyrs of Scotland repose, not far\r\nfrom the Grassmarket, where they were mostly offered up. I stood upon\r\nthe very spot to-day where they suffered. We had a terrible wind all\r\nlast night, which, with the rain, carried off nearly all the snow. The\r\nmorning was so stormy that I could not fulfill my conditional engagement\r\nto breakfast with Mr. Nicoll and look at his curiosities. So I repaired\r\nto the university at ten; heard Sir Charles Bell,[46] the professor of\r\nsurgery,--a decent lecturer, but not remarkable. At eleven I heard the\r\ncelebrated Dr. Chalmers, the professor of divinity. The old man has a\r\nheavy, strongly-marked Scotch countenance, which, however, brightens\r\nvery much when he is engaged in his discourse. His manner is rather\r\ninelegant and his dialect broad Scotch and peculiar. But the matter is\r\nso rich that he carries all before him. Every word is full of thought,\r\nand he occasionally rose to a very powerful eloquence. He is much\r\nbeloved, and is considered by all parties, perhaps, as the strong man of\r\nScotland. The subject of his lecture this morning was the advantage (and\r\nthe abuse) of Scripture criticism. It was a treat to hear him. He paid a\r\nhigh compliment, in the course of his remarks, to our Moses Stuart.\r\n\r\nThe weather growing by this time more tolerable, I walked about\r\ntown,--visited the Parliament House, the Library of the Writers to the\r\nSignet; passed through the Grassmarket, returned here, looked at plants\r\nwith Dr. Greville; dined; received a parcel from Sir William Hooker\r\ncontaining a few plants I had accidentally left (a few he had given me).\r\nA very kind letter informed me that he would be in London about the same\r\ntime with me (which I had in part expected, and about which hangs a tale\r\nI must write soon), and also a fine parcel of letters of introduction\r\nfor me, both to persons on the way to London, and also on the\r\nContinent,--to Delessert, De Candolle, Martins, Endlicher, Humboldt,\r\netc. Truly he is a kind man; he has laid me under lasting obligations.\r\nHe asks me to say to Dr. Torrey that his Grace of Bedford is anxious to\r\nreceive also the Hudsonia ericoides from New Jersey, and he will be\r\ngreatly obliged if he will send a box of it to Woburn early in the\r\nspring. Attended this evening a meeting of the Royal Society, Dr.\r\nAbercrombie[47] (author of “Intellectual Powers,” etc.) in the chair.\r\nDr. A. is at the head of the profession here; is greatly esteemed, and\r\nis a most exemplary Christian. An interesting paper was read by\r\nProfessor Forbes, of whom I have spoken before; a man whom from his\r\nvery youthful appearance you could never have imagined as the successful\r\ncandidate to the professor’s chair against Dr. Brewster. But Dr.\r\nBrewster is no favorite in Edinburgh. Other distinguished men were\r\nthere. I was introduced to Professor Christison,[48] had some pleasant\r\nconversation; promised, if practicable, to hear him lecture to-morrow at\r\nnine A.M., and look at his museum of materia medica. We had tea after\r\nthe adjournment, according to the usual custom here, which is a very\r\npleasant one. I only count upon two days more in Edinburgh, and have yet\r\nmuch to do. I am anxious to reach London, where I hope there are letters\r\nfor me. Good-night. May God bless you all, and keep you.\r\n\r\nMELROSE, January 10, 1839, Thursday evening.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th inst., Tuesday, I went immediately after breakfast to the\r\nuniversity and heard Professor Christison’s lecture, Materia Medica. He\r\nis an excellent lecturer. I spent a half hour with him, in looking over\r\nhis cabinet of preparations, which contains a large number of fruits,\r\netc., preserved in strong brine instead of spirits. I acquired some\r\nuseful information concerning the best way to close the jars, for which\r\nhe has some very neat plans. Then I heard Professor Forbes again;\r\nelegant as usual, but he did not succeed very well in his experiments.\r\nThe next hour I had a rich treat. I heard another lecture from Professor\r\nWilson, on the Association of Ideas, which on this occasion he noticed\r\nin a more practical view than before. He recited, in his glowing\r\nmanner, several passages from Virgil, and a long one from Milton, and\r\ngave a long and most eloquent analytic commentary upon each, far\r\nexceeding anything of the kind I ever heard before. After visiting the\r\nlibrary of the university--a most magnificent room--I set out for\r\nHolyrood House.... I bought one or two poor prints, a cast of the\r\nseal-ring of Mary, plucked a bit of holly from a bush standing by the\r\nplace by the altar before which Mary was married to Bothwell, and\r\nreluctantly took my leave. There was yet some time remaining, so I set\r\nout to climb Arthur’s Seat, which rises abruptly behind Salisbury Crags\r\nto the height of eight or nine hundred feet. I attained my wish, and had\r\na beautiful view, from the summit, of the city beneath my feet, and the\r\nwide country around. I descended more rapidly than I went up, though at\r\nsome risk to my neck. Returned to Dr. Greville’s, where I dined and\r\nspent all the evening.\r\n\r\nI had engaged yesterday to breakfast with Dr. Graham. I therefore set\r\noff early for that purpose; afterward accompanied him to the Garden,\r\nexamined the grounds, etc., passed some time in the splendid palm-house.\r\nI spent some portion of the morning also with Mr. Nicoll, examining with\r\nthe microscope his beautiful collection of recent and fossil wood in\r\nthin slices; learned how to prepare them. Then arranged my affairs to\r\nleave Edinburgh in the morning. In the evening Dr. Greville and myself\r\ndined with Mr. Wilson (gentleman naturalist), the brother of the gifted\r\nProfessor Wilson; himself almost equally gifted, but with a more healthy\r\ntone of mind. He interested us so much that our stay was prolonged until\r\nnearly the “wee short hour ayont the twal,” when we parted, after a\r\npressing invitation to visit him at his country residence in case I ever\r\nvisited Scotland at a more pleasant season. Taking leave of my kind\r\nfriends the Grevilles, I was early this morning on my way to Melrose. I\r\nhave been received with the utmost kindness, not only by this agreeable\r\nand most excellent family, but among all the acquaintance I have made in\r\nEdinburgh. I had purchased for you a collection of hymns, etc., edited\r\nby Dr. Greville and his pastor, Mr. Drummond, with which I was very much\r\npleased, and doubt not you would like them much. But Dr. Greville saw\r\nit, and afterwards insisted on sending a much handsomer copy to Dr.\r\nTorrey, which was accordingly placed in my hands for him. Melrose is\r\nabout thirty-six miles from Edinburgh, on one of the routes to\r\nNewcastle. We came upon the Tweed among a rugged range of hills, at\r\nfirst a very small stream; followed it along the sinuous valley for a\r\nlong way, until it became a pretty considerable river, for Great\r\nBritain; at length the valley grew wider, softer, and in the proper\r\nseason, doubtless very beautiful. A smaller stream joined it at some\r\ndistance before us, and as its opening vale came into view, the\r\ndriver--I beg his pardon, coachman--pointed with his whip to the\r\nopposite side and said, “Abbotsford; “ and true enough the turrets of\r\nthis quaint castellated house were distinguishable, in the midst of a\r\ngrove mostly of Scott’s own planting, near the banks of the Yarrow. We\r\nsoon after crossed the Tweed, at the place where the White Lady\r\nfrightened the sacristan in “The Monastery; “ the scene of which, you\r\nknow, was laid at Melrose and in the neighborhood. The fine old ruin of\r\nMelrose Abbey now came into view, half surrounded by a dirty little\r\nScotch village. Here I abandoned the coach until to-morrow, secured a\r\ngig, and was soon on my way to Abbotsford.... I walked back from\r\nAbbotsford, noticing more particularly the beauty of the valley, and the\r\nfine Eildon Hills which rise behind Melrose, from whose summit, it is\r\nsaid, a very beautiful prospect may be obtained. I then spent the\r\nremainder of the afternoon about Melrose Abbey, the most beautiful ruin\r\nI have ever seen or expect to see; more beautiful than I had imagined,\r\nand just in that state of dilapidation in which it appears to the\r\ngreatest advantage as a ruin, for were it entire it would be indeed\r\nmagnificent. I feel now as if I should never care to see another ruin of\r\nthe kind; and therefore I shall not visit Dryburgh Abbey (where Scott is\r\nburied), as I had intended; although I suppose we shall pass by nearly\r\nin sight of it to-morrow. I wish I could bring you some sketch or print\r\nthat would give you some idea of Melrose, but I fear this is impossible.\r\nThe exquisite carvings in stone, especially, cannot be appreciated until\r\nthey are seen. It is said (I forget the lines) that Melrose should be\r\nseen by moonlight, and this I can well imagine; but this evening there\r\nis neither moonlight nor starlight....\r\n\r\nDURHAM, Saturday evening, January 12, 1839.\r\n\r\nSoon leaving the Tweed we crossed a range of hills, and came down into\r\nthe fertile Teviotdale, so famous in border story. Again leaving this\r\nvalley, we wound our way up the Jedwater, a tributary of the Teviot,\r\nrising high up in the Cheviot Hills, just on the line between England\r\nand Scotland. We passed Jedburgh, a Scotch village of considerable size\r\nand importance, dirty and comfortless of course. Here is an old abbey,\r\nwhich I should have been loth to pass by had I not seen Melrose; thence\r\nwe ascended the Jed for many a weary mile, until we reached its source\r\nhigh among the Cheviot Hills. Our course was literally “over the\r\nmountain and over the moor,” for after a tedious ascent we crossed the\r\nboundary line at an elevation of fifteen hundred feet above the level of\r\nthe sea. We were by this time thoroughly drenched with mist and rain;\r\nthe wind forbidding the use of our umbrellas. We immediately commenced\r\nour descent, and just at dusk stopped for a hasty dinner at Otterbourne,\r\nso famous in the history of the border warfare as the place of the\r\nmemorable Chevy Chase. It was too dark to see the cross erected to mark\r\nthe spot where Percy fell. Pass we over the ride from this to Newcastle,\r\nas we saw nothing, though we passed near some places of\r\ninterest,--Chillingham, the residence of the Earl of Tankerville, for\r\nexample,--and arrived at Newcastle about nine o’clock in the evening. In\r\nthe morning I delivered notes of introduction from Hooker and Greville\r\nto George Wailes, Esq., one of the active members of the Newcastle\r\nNatural History Society; visited their fine building and really splendid\r\nmuseum, especially rich in fossil remains and also in the British birds;\r\nmade arrangements for correspondence and exchange with the Michigan\r\nState Survey; was introduced to a botanist or two; visited the castle\r\nbuilt by Robert, brother of William the Conqueror, if I recollect\r\naright, which has stood firmly for many a year, and may stand for\r\ncenturies more, or as long as the world standeth.... Arrived at Durham\r\nat eight in the evening. I called almost immediately upon Professor\r\nJohnston[49] and delivered Doctor Torrey’s letter and parcel, when we\r\nrecognized each other as fellow-passengers in the coach from Newcastle,\r\nhe being a Scotch gentleman,--looking very like my friend Couthouy of\r\nthe exploring expedition,--whom I was far from imagining would prove to\r\nbe the professor in the Durham University; took my tea and spent the\r\ngreater part of the evening with him. He told me he was just about to\r\nsend a parcel to Doctor Torrey by a friend going next week to America. I\r\nmust embrace this opportunity to send my letters, now forming a somewhat\r\nbulky parcel....\r\n\r\nSpent Monday with Professor Johnston in his laboratory, witnessing the\r\nprogress of some analyses of resins, etc., in which he is now much\r\nengaged; also went through the old castle, now used for the university;\r\ndined with Professor Johnston at four clock; returned to the hotel....\r\nTook my tea with him, and he accompanied me at half past nine to the\r\ncoach office whence I took coach for Leeds. I have little to say about\r\nDurham University, promising as it is in some respects, because they\r\nhave adopted the monkish system of Oxford and Cambridge to the fullest\r\nextent; the professors and tutors except Johnston are all clergymen; the\r\ncurriculum includes nothing but classics, a little mathematics, and less\r\nlogic; their professor of natural philosophy never lectures; they give\r\ntheir professor of chemistry, mineralogy, and geology just fifty pounds\r\na year (nothing for his experiments), and require no one to attend his\r\nlectures.\r\n\r\nBut now I must record some painful news, just learned to-day, which has\r\nshocked me exceedingly, but which you will have heard of long ere this\r\nreaches you; viz., the loss of the noble ship Pennsylvania, the death\r\nof Captain Smith, the first and second mate, and some of the passengers,\r\nI hardly yet know how many. I had grown much attached to this ship, and\r\nthought highly of its officers, who had been kind to me....\r\n\r\nLONDON, January 17, 1839, Thursday evening.\r\n\r\nThis is dated at this modern Babylon, where I arrived about nine o’clock\r\nlast evening. I stopped at the White Boar, Coventry Street, Piccadilly;\r\nhad a quiet night’s sleep; rose early this morning, and had breakfasted\r\nand was on my way to Dr. Boott’s[50] (24 Gower Street) before ten\r\no’clock. I found Doctor B. at home; was kindly received and was\r\nintroduced to his wife, mother, children, and a brother from Boston who\r\nis now with him; spent an hour or two with him; heard that Hooker was in\r\ntown. Though not a public day went to the British Museum; inquired for\r\nBrown (Mr. Brown, for he does not like to be called Dr.), and was so\r\nfortunate as to find not only the man himself I was so anxious to set my\r\neyes on, but also Hooker, Joseph Hooker, Bennett,[51] and Dr.\r\nRichardson.[52] Passed an hour or two. Brown invited Hooker and me to\r\nbreakfast with him on Saturday morning; went out with Hooker; first to\r\nthe Linnæan Society; introduced to David Don,[53] a stout Scotchman,\r\nand looked through the rooms of the society. Don offered to give me\r\nevery possible facility in my pursuits, but of course I said nothing to\r\nhim about Pursh’s[54] herbarium at Lambert’s, of which he was formerly\r\ncurator; for since he married Lambert’s housekeeper, or cook, I forget\r\nwhich, Lambert will not allow him to come into the house. From here\r\nHooker took me,--stopping by the way at Philip’s, one of the most\r\neminent painters, whose gallery we saw,--to the house of Lambert[55]\r\nhimself, the queerest old mortal I ever set eyes on. But Carey’s\r\ndescription of the man was so accurate that I should have known him\r\nanywhere. I was of course invited to breakfast with him any morning at\r\nnine; he showed us his Cacti stuffed with plaster of paris, among others\r\na very curious one called muff-cactus, which really looks just like a\r\nlady’s muff and is not much smaller. Lambert’s specimens are the only\r\nones known, and he gave for them something like a hundred guineas,--the\r\nold goose! A woman has the care of his collections in place of Don. She\r\nstuffs the cacti and seems quite as enthusiastic as old Lambert himself.\r\nWe went next to the Horticultural Society’s rooms in Regent Street in\r\nhopes to find Mr. Bentham; but instead we met Lindley, who received us\r\nvery politely; he asked me to send him my address the moment I was\r\nsettled in lodgings.... Here I parted from Hooker for the present,\r\ndeclining an invitation to join him at the dinner of the Royal Society’s\r\nClub, for which I was afterwards almost sorry, as I should have met\r\nthere Hallam, the historian, and some other distinguished men, as also\r\nBrown, whose peculiar dry wit is said to have abounded greatly. Hooker\r\nseems as anxious to serve me and aid me here in London as at his own\r\nhome. He is the most noble man I ever knew. Thence I took a cab and\r\ndrove into the City, through Temple Bar, down Fleet Street; drove round\r\nSt. Paul’s, to the office of Baring Brothers & Company, who are to be my\r\nbankers and to whom my letters here may now be addressed; thence to the\r\noffice of Wiley & Putnam in Paternoster Row; did not see Mr. Wiley, but\r\nlearned that the copies of our “Flora” had not arrived, which I am very\r\nsorry for, and don’t know how to account for it; called at C. Rich’s,\r\nbut found no letters, which was a sad disappointment indeed; thence back\r\nhere to dinner. At eight o’clock went to Somerset House to attend a\r\nmeeting of the Royal Society, where again I met Hooker and Dr.\r\nRichardson. Brown was also present, for the first time in eight years.\r\nRoyle[56] was in the chair, at which the botanists present sneered much,\r\nas they evidently think him too small a man to fill the seat occupied by\r\nNewton, etc. I don’t know how he happened to be one of the\r\nvice-presidents. I was introduced to him after the meeting, as also to\r\nmany others. J. E. Gray,[57] who was very polite, gave me and Joseph\r\nHooker tickets for Faraday’s lecture of to-morrow evening, invited me to\r\ndine with him to-morrow, etc. I was glad to make the acquaintance of Mr.\r\nCriff[58] (or Clift) the curator of the Hunterian Museum, the man who\r\nexposed Sir Everard Home, who invited us to come and see that museum.\r\nWhile we were conversing, a gentleman, whom Hooker did not at the time\r\nrecognize, addressed us, and after some conversation with me asked me if\r\nI would like to be introduced to Sir Astley Cooper, and see his museum.\r\nI answered of course that it would be a great gratification, when he\r\nintroduced himself as Bransby Cooper, the nephew of Sir Astley,--of whom\r\nI have heard formerly not a little,--gave me his address, and Joseph\r\nHooker and myself are to call on him on Monday next. I was introduced\r\nalso to Dr. Roget,[59] but saw not so much of him as I could wish; so\r\nyou see I have met more distinguished men in one day than I might\r\nelsewhere meet with perhaps in a whole life. But I must break off; I am\r\nengaged to breakfast in the morning with Hooker, to meet also Dr.\r\nRichardson....\r\n\r\nWHITE BEAR, PICCADILLY, 18th January, 1839, Friday evening.\r\n\r\nI am not yet in private lodgings, but hope to be so to-morrow. You must\r\nnot expect me to mention half the things I see in a day here in this\r\nbusy metropolis, where as yet everything I have seen has been viewed in\r\nthe most desultory manner. I breakfasted with Hooker and Richardson, who\r\nleft me for a half hour at the Adelaide Gallery, where I saw very many\r\nthings to interest me, which we will not stop to talk of now, as I hope\r\nto be there again; among other things, a live Gymnotus or Electrical\r\nEel, which gives powerful shocks, they say, for I did not choose to feel\r\nit myself. Thence we visited the Museum of the Zoölogical Society, for\r\nwhich Dr. Richardson not only procured us free admittance, but procured\r\nfor us an order to visit the Zoölogical Gardens; made calls with Hooker,\r\nwhom Joseph and I left with the Chancellor of the Exchequer in Downing\r\nStreet, while we passed by Westminster Hall and Abbey down to Bentham’s,\r\nwho has a beautiful residence as retired as the country. Found Bentham\r\nan exceedingly pleasant and amiable man; spent an hour or two, till\r\nHooker came in; accepted an invitation to dine with him to-morrow; went\r\ninto the City; introduced to Richard Taylor,[60] at his printing-office;\r\nwere all invited to breakfast on Tuesday morning next; went to Longman’s\r\nfamous bookstore and warehouse; one of the young Longmans politely\r\nshowed us over the building, showed us room after room filled with solid\r\nliterature,--a most surprising quantity; went by St. Paul’s again, saw\r\nthe Bank, etc.; took an omnibus again to West End; passed by the London\r\nUniversity, etc. Joe Hooker and I went to dine with J. E. Gray, who has\r\ntaken it into his head to show us no little attention; he has lately\r\nmarried a rich wife, a widow, much older than himself; I was quite\r\npleased with her. Went to the Botanical Society,--poor concern; and then\r\nto hear Faraday give the first lecture of the season at the Royal\r\nInstitution, Mr. Gray having kindly offered us tickets. I was\r\nunexpectedly introduced to Faraday just before the lecture; pleasant\r\nman, with a very quick and lively expression of countenance. The lecture\r\nwas on Electrical Eels, etc.; most elegant lecturer he is; brilliant and\r\nrapid experimenter. I hope to hear him again.\r\n\r\nSaturday evening, January 19.--I am now in lodgings, No. 36\r\nNorthumberland Street, near Northumberland House, Charing Cross, in the\r\nroom just vacated by Dr. Richardson; sixteen shillings a week, and a\r\nshilling for my breakfast when I choose to take it here. It is half past\r\neleven. I have just come in; no fire, but fortunately my occupation for\r\nto-day is soon told. Hooker, Joe, and I breakfasted with Brown at his\r\nhouse, and stayed with him until four o’clock in the afternoon! I have a\r\ngood deal to say about him, but not here. He is a curious man in other\r\nthings besides botany. He has a few choice paintings, and a few\r\nexquisite engravings he has picked up on the Continent. I coveted them\r\nfor you. They are just what we should be delighted to have. I dressed\r\nfor dinner, then drove with my luggage to my present lodgings, and then\r\ntook up Hooker and Joe for Bentham’s to dinner at half past six, where\r\nwe met Lindley and Mr. Brydges; the dinner was just the beau ideal of\r\ntaste and simple elegance. In the drawing-room coffee was served up, and\r\nin a half hour Assam tea. I am greatly pleased with Bentham, and\r\ndelighted with Mrs. B. But more of this anon. We are to breakfast with\r\nhim on Monday, and then make up a party to Kew and the Horticultural\r\nGardens. The house he lives in, a pleasant place, plain but tastefully\r\nfurnished and arranged, was the one where Jeremy Bentham lived....\r\n\r\nTuesday evening, January 22.--I have to account for myself for two days\r\npast, but fortunately this can be done in general terms in few words.\r\nWere I to enter very fully into particulars I should fill several\r\nsheets. Yesterday Sir William Hooker, Joseph, and I breakfasted\r\naccording to appointment with Bentham, and set out, although the day\r\nwas rainy, for a visit to the Horticultural Gardens at Chiswick. We went\r\nin an omnibus, and I noticed on the way Apsley House (Duke of\r\nWellington), and the monument to his Grace in Hyde Park, near his house\r\n(what is the good of honors, indeed, if one cannot see them?), Holland\r\nHouse, which I saw from some distance, etc. We found Lindley at the\r\nGardens, and looked through the grounds. They have very few hothouses as\r\nyet, but have just dug the foundation of a very splendid one, which is,\r\nhowever, to form one wing merely of the general plan. We went to Kew,\r\nabout two miles farther, and looked through those fine old grounds and\r\ngardens. The hothouses and the collections in them were much larger and\r\nmore interesting than I had anticipated. They are particularly rich in\r\nNew Holland and Cape plants. There is a new conservatory for large\r\nplants, a fine one certainly, which cost six thousand pounds, and the\r\nroof was taken from the greenhouse at Buckingham Palace, and therefore\r\ncost nothing. It seems an extravagant job, and Mr. Bentham feels sure a\r\nmuch better one of the same size could be built for four thousand\r\npounds. While here we paid a visit to Francis Bauer,[61] now eighty-five\r\nyears old, and much broken down, but still hard at work, and making as\r\nbeautiful drawings as ever (beyond comparison excellent), and as\r\ndelicate microscopical examinations. He has lately been working at\r\nfossil Infusoria, and showed me figures of Bailey’s plate in “Silliman’s\r\nJournal” which he had copied. He was greatly pleased when I offered to\r\nsend him specimens of the things themselves. He showed me the original\r\nred snow from arctic America, and also his splendid drawings. Returned\r\nto town, and dined with Bentham.\r\n\r\nThis morning we breakfasted with Richard Taylor in the City; and went\r\nafterwards to the College of Surgeons, by appointment Hooker had made,\r\nto see Professor Owen, and the fine museum of the college under his\r\ncharge (John Hunter’s originally); a magnificent collection it is, in\r\nthe finest possible order; and the arrangement and plan of the rooms is\r\nfar, very far better and prettier than any I have seen. I shall make\r\nsome memoranda about it. We there met Mr. Darwin, the naturalist who\r\naccompanied Captain King in the Beagle. I was glad to form the\r\nacquaintance of such a profound scientific scholar as Professor\r\nOwen,--the best comparative anatomist living, still young, and one of\r\nthe most mild, gentle, childlike men I ever saw. He gave us a great deal\r\nof most interesting information, and showed us personally throughout the\r\nwhole museum. I am every day under deeper obligations to Sir William\r\nHooker, to whom I owe the gratification of forming so many acquaintances\r\nunder such favorable circumstances. Hooker stays over night often at his\r\nbrother-in-law’s, Sir Francis Palgrave, the great antiquarian and Saxon\r\nscholar, Keeper of the Records, of whom I have read so much in the\r\n“British Review.” His eldest daughter, Maria, is spending the winter\r\nthere. On Hooker’s return on Monday he was so kind as to bring me an\r\ninvitation from Lady Palgrave to dine with them on Saturday, which will\r\nbe the last I shall see of Hooker, as he is to set out on Monday for\r\nhome. In the afternoon we spent an interesting hour in looking through\r\nthe vast halls of the British Museum, particularly through the\r\nsculpture, the Elgin marbles, Egyptian antiquities, etc. These last are\r\nmuch more grand than I had supposed. Indeed, I was struck with wonder. I\r\nhope sometime to spend a day or two in looking through these rich\r\ncollections. Called on Lyell the geologist.\r\n\r\nWe dined with Dr. Roget, the secretary of the Royal Society, where we\r\nmet Sir Francis Staunton, a great Oriental scholar and traveler,\r\nProfessor Royle, Dr. Boott, and two others whose names I forget. But\r\nbest of all Dr. Boott brought me a letter from Dr. Torrey, dated\r\nDecember 25 (Christmas), and I soon contrived to get into a quiet corner\r\nto read it; right glad I was to hear from home once more; I will answer\r\nit to-morrow. We left very early, as Hooker was to go to Hampstead,\r\nwhere Sir Francis Palgrave resides. Joe and I walked with him, till he\r\nshould find a stage; but as none overtook us and the night was fine we\r\nwalked the whole way, three or four miles, and having left Sir William\r\nsafe and sound, and seen Sir Francis Palgrave for a moment, the\r\nremainder of the family having retired to rest, Joe and I walked back\r\nagain to town. I confess I am a little tired, and am quite willing to go\r\nto bed. A Dieu.\r\n\r\nWednesday, January 23, 1839.--Breakfasted and dined with Mr. Bentham,\r\nand studied plants with him all day and a good portion of the evening,\r\nexcepting an hour or so in the morning when we walked out, and Bentham\r\ntook me through the splendid house of the Athenæum Club, and we also\r\nvisited the National Gallery, and saw fine paintings in great numbers\r\nfrom almost every artist ancient or modern. It is very near my lodgings,\r\nand I intend to visit it again. Here are some of West’s original\r\npictures, and likewise the paintings or sketches of Hogarth from which\r\nhis well-known engravings were taken. They are much more expressive\r\nthan the prints. E. would enjoy many of them very much, and especially\r\nsome of Wilkie’s of the same kind.\r\n\r\nI am to take my breakfast in my lodgings to-morrow morning, which I have\r\nas yet done but once. I sent yesterday my letter of introduction to\r\nWilliam Christy, who lives out of town, and received to-day a most\r\npolite invitation to dine with him to-morrow, and meet Hooker and Joe.\r\n\r\nThursday.--Breakfast at home. Call with Joe Hooker on Bransby Cooper,\r\nand then on Sir Astley Cooper; pleasantly received, saw some very\r\ncurious preparations; spent the morning with Bentham, and dined at Mr.\r\nChristy’s, Clapham Road, where I spent an agreeable evening. Returning,\r\nwrote a letter to Dr. Torrey to go by mail to-morrow to Bristol for the\r\nGreat Western.\r\n\r\nFriday evening.--I breakfasted at my lodgings this morning, and\r\nafterwards walked out with Sir William and Joe Hooker to Regent’s Park;\r\nwent to the Coliseum to see the Panorama of London, and well worth\r\nseeing it is. It will save me a visit to the top of the dome of St.\r\nPaul’s, I think, for the Panorama is said to be more perfect than\r\nnature. I will say no more about it, as Dr. Torrey has seen it. The\r\nillusion is perfect, were it not for some unseemly cracks in the sky! We\r\ncalled on Dr. Boott; then went into the City. Our object was to visit\r\nthe museum at the India House (where the poet Lamb spent so great a\r\nportion of his life). I made the acquaintance, of Dr. Horsfield,[62] the\r\ncurator, who also collected the best part of the museum in Java and\r\nIndia. He is an American, if you can so call a man who has not been in\r\nthe country since the year 1800. I was much interested with the library,\r\nwhich contains a vast quantity of Indian idols, sculptures, and\r\nantiquities, as well as fine Chinese curiosities. It is immensely rich,\r\nalso, in Indian, Persian, and Arabic manuscripts; the finest in the\r\nworld in such things. Some of the Persian (Arabic) manuscripts are most\r\nbeautifully illustrated, or illuminated, and the writing is neater than\r\nyou can conceive. Here is preserved also an original petition of the\r\nIndia Company to Oliver Cromwell, with the answer in his own rough and\r\nstrong handwriting.[63] ... We dined at Lambert’s, where we found Robert\r\nBrown, Mr. Ward,[64] who had been looking for me, and immediately asked\r\nme to name a day to see his plants in the Wardian cases, and an evening\r\nerelong to examine some thirty or forty first-rate microscopes which he\r\nhas in his house; also Dr. Bostock, Mr. Benson, a legal gentleman, a\r\ngreat scholar and author; and last, not least, yet certainly almost the\r\nlast person I should have expected to see, Lady Charlotte Bury (formerly\r\nLady Charlotte Campbell), whom you will remember as the author of that\r\nbook on the secret history of the court of George IV. and his Queen, of\r\nwhich we read together, that summer, the deeply interesting review by\r\nBrougham. Lady Bury is now supposed to be sixty years old, and was for a\r\nlong time considered as the handsomest woman in Great Britain; she\r\nstill looks well, though too embonpoint, and dresses like a young lady,\r\nwith short sleeves. She is of a high family, a sister of the present\r\nDuke of Argyll, and is certainly talented; she is said to be quite poor.\r\nHer daughters are married into families of rank, except one (Miss Bury)\r\nwho was with her mother at Lambert’s, whom Sir William Hooker thought\r\nremarkably handsome, but I did not. As I have not a high respect for\r\nLady Bury’s character I did not throw myself into her circle, and saw\r\nalmost nothing of her the whole evening. We came away early.\r\n\r\nSaturday evening.--I paid a visit, this morning, in company with Joe\r\nHooker, to the Zoölogical Gardens in Regent’s Park, where we saw all\r\nkinds of four-footed beasts, and fowl, and creeping things. There are\r\nfour giraffes, but none quite so large as those we saw in New York.\r\nThere were a very fine orangoutang, very gentle and amiable, a curious\r\nspider-monkey, and other curious animals in great plenty. The finest\r\nresidences I have seen in London are those which look upon Regent’s\r\nPark. Returning, we called upon Lambert, Saturday being a kind of public\r\nday with him, and there met that Nestor of botanists, Mr. Menzies,[65]\r\nwhom I found a most pleasant and kind-hearted old man; he invited me\r\nvery earnestly to come down and see him, which I will try to do some\r\nday. Meanwhile I expect to meet him on Tuesday at Mr. Ward’s.\r\n\r\nWe just had time to go down into the City to call on Mr. Putnam\r\n(publisher) and to learn that copies of the “Flora” had arrived, but\r\nwere not yet cleared from the custom-house; then took the Hampstead\r\ncoach to dine at Sir Francis Palgrave’s. Excepting Hooker and Joe, I\r\nalmost forget who the guests were. I was not interested in any of them\r\nparticularly. Sir Francis was very agreeable; his conversational powers\r\nare almost equal to his erudition. His lady, who looks very much like\r\nLady Hooker, is, like all that family, learned and accomplished. I was\r\nglad also to meet Hooker’s eldest daughter.\r\n\r\nThe boys interested me much; I think I never saw more intelligent lads.\r\nSir Francis asked me to call at the Chapter-House, Westminster Abbey,\r\nhis office as Keeper of the Records, and he would show me the Domesday\r\nBook. How a sight of it would electrify Dr. Barrett! He asked me at\r\ndinner the meaning of the term locofoco as applied to a party in the\r\nUnited States. I gave him the story of the meeting in Tammany Hall which\r\ngave rise to the designation, which afforded much amusement.\r\n\r\nSunday evening, January 27.--I was better prepared than last Sabbath,\r\nfor I took pains to call yesterday at the office of the Religious Tract\r\nSociety, and found where Baptist Noel preached. It is St. John’s Chapel,\r\nat considerable distance from here. Nevertheless I attended there\r\nto-day, and have reason to be glad that I did so, for I heard a most\r\nexcellent sermon in the morning, from Psalm ciii. 10-12. Mr. Noel is a\r\nmost simple, winning preacher, and his sermon was the most thoroughly\r\nevangelical and earnest I ever heard from an Episcopal pulpit. I wish I\r\ncould give you some idea of it. I took notes for your benefit as well as\r\nI could, and have written them out, but they will give you a very\r\nimperfect idea of it. The church, a large one, with double galleries\r\naround three sides, was crowded. This afternoon his assistant, Mr.\r\nGarwood, preached, and there was room enough, but we had a good sermon.\r\nThis Mr. Garwood, you may have seen by the papers, has lately been\r\npersecuted a little by his bishop, for acting as secretary to the London\r\nCity Mission. Both he and Mr. Noel are doing much good in raising the\r\nstandard of piety and active benevolence in the church they belong to. I\r\nhope by next Sunday to inquire out Dr. Reed’s church. I have not been\r\nout this evening, but have employed myself in copying out my poor notes\r\non the morning sermon, which I trust soon to forward to you.\r\n\r\nMonday evening, January 28, 1839.--I spent the morning with Bentham, by\r\nappointment, with whom I breakfasted and looked at Leguminosæ until two\r\nP.M.; then joined Joe Hooker (took leave of Sir William this morning,\r\nwho has returned to Glasgow, via Woburn); made calls, among others on\r\nDr. Rostock, who received me very politely; we then dined together at a\r\nchop-house; called on Dr. Boott, spent an hour or two in his very\r\npleasant family; then attended a meeting of the Royal Geographical\r\nSociety, in which all that interested me was a paper by Professor\r\nRobinson of New York, on some interesting matters of ancient geography\r\nconnected with his travels in Asia Minor. The paper was sent to the\r\nGeographical Society by a learned German geographer; it excited much\r\ninterest....\r\n\r\nLondon, January 24, 1839.--I have so far been seeing men and things\r\nchiefly, but have had one or two botanical sittings with Bentham, who is\r\na thoroughly kind and good fellow. He immediately had all the remaining\r\nparcels of Douglas’s Californian and Oregon plants sent down to his\r\nhouse, and has supplied me as well as he could; and a valuable parcel I\r\nshall have of them....\r\n\r\nI have seen considerable of Brown, and like him much better than I\r\nthought, although he is certainly peculiar. The day we breakfasted with\r\nhim we remained until four P.M., and he offered to show anything I\r\nwished at the British Museum. He showed us all Bauer’s drawings in his\r\npossession (I have since seen Francis Bauer). He has much more general\r\ninformation than I supposed; is full of gossip, and has a great deal of\r\ndry wit.\r\n\r\nHe is growing old fast, and I suspect works very little now, and I fear\r\nthere is not very much more work now to be expected of him. He knows\r\neverything!...\r\n\r\nI spent a good part of yesterday with Bentham, and was to have met\r\nHooker at the Geological Society in the evening; but botany prevailed\r\nand I stayed with Bentham, and was a little sorry afterwards, as I\r\nshould have seen at the society Whewell! Daubeny! Chantry the sculptor,\r\netc.--I have bought a colored copy of Wallich’s “Plantæ Asiatiecæ\r\nRariores,” 3 vols. fol., very fine, for £15; the publishing price was\r\n£36,--the present price by Henry Bohn, who has bought up not only this\r\nbut almost every other expensive British work on natural history, is\r\n£26. It is not yet come round from Edinburgh. I will soon send it to\r\nyou.... I have seen the “Atakta Botanica” of Endlicher, where there is a\r\nplate of Ungnadia (not Ungnodia, as spelled in “Companion to the\r\nBotanical Magazine”), but no letter-press as yet....\r\n\r\nJanuary 30, Wednesday evening.... Yesterday morning Joe Hooker and\r\nmyself breakfasted together, and then paid a visit to Westminster Abbey,\r\nwhich we examined in every part, from Poets’ Corner to Henry VII.’s\r\nChapel....\r\n\r\nAs we left the Abbey (where, by the way, we were most thoroughly chilled\r\nwith our long stay), we went into the Chapter House adjoining, a very\r\nantique building crammed with old records and musty manuscripts, and Sir\r\nFrancis Palgrave kindly showed us the famous Domesday Book, which is in\r\na perfect state of preservation; all the writing perfectly distinct, and\r\nso plainly executed that we could read it, here and there, with moderate\r\nfacility. He showed us a copy of a treaty made with France by Cardinal\r\nWolsey, of which the immense seal appended was cut in gold, and of the\r\nmost elaborate workmanship. We saw also the original papal bull sent to\r\nHenry VIII., constituting him “Defender of the Faith”! We went from this\r\nto Westminster Hall; saw the large room, which is very fine; looked into\r\nthe Court of Exchequer, and saw the Lord Chancellor and other judges in\r\ntheir full-bottom wigs, most funny to behold, I assure you; and the\r\nbarristers with their queer horse-hair wigs, frizzled on the top of\r\ntheir heads, but tied up into nice and regular curls behind, which fall\r\nupon their shoulders. The case of the Canadian prisoners was then under\r\nconsideration. We then rode in an omnibus to the City and visited St.\r\nPaul’s Church, which, grand as it is, does not show to advantage after\r\nWestminster Abbey. The monumental statuary is very fine; some of it I\r\nwould mention, but the extreme lateness of the hour obliges me\r\ndiscreetly to break off and finish my account of the day hereafter. Bon\r\nsoir, or rather Bon jour!\r\n\r\nThursday evening.... To commence where I broke off with Tuesday. We went\r\nto dine, by appointment, with Mr. Ward, the plant-case man, at three\r\nP.M., which hour was appointed for the purpose of showing us the\r\nplant-cases, etc., by daylight. Ward is one of the most obliging men I\r\never knew. I was perhaps a little disappointed in his plants, but this\r\nis the very worst season of the year, particularly in London, and his\r\nhouse, which is in the heart of the city, near London Docks, is very\r\nbadly situated as to light. But I have learned something from him, and\r\nfeel confident that I shall be able to manage our plant-cases much\r\nbetter hereafter. Menzies was there, and a truly kind-hearted old man he\r\nis. I was to have returned in time to spend the evening at Bentham’s,\r\nbut owing to the stormy weather I did not reach my lodgings till it was\r\ntoo late. On Friday (a snowy day) I was out rather late; went to\r\nBentham’s, where I spent the whole morning, dined with him and Mrs.\r\nBentham, three in all!--they have no children, and live in the most cosy\r\nand quiet way you could imagine--and spent the whole evening with him in\r\nlabeling plants which he selected for me from his duplicates. To-day,\r\nJoseph Hooker having concluded to postpone till this evening his\r\ndeparture for Glasgow, and having written accordingly to Ward to meet\r\nus, we visited the famous greenhouses and conservatories of Loddiges.\r\nMiss Maria Hooker was with us, having come out from Hampstead for the\r\npurpose. It is rather a long ride to Hackney, but we were well repaid.\r\nThe collection of Orchideæ is immense and very beautiful, but a very\r\nsmall portion is now in flower. The palm-house, ample and magnificent as\r\nit is, rather disappointed me; it seemed not so much larger than that\r\nof the Edinburgh garden, and the plants are not in such nice order.\r\nLoddiges was very kind to me. Ward selected a few pretty plants for Miss\r\nHooker. I forgot for the moment that there was such a world of waters\r\nbetween us, and was on the point of selecting some for you know whom; I\r\nam not sure that I did not bring some after all.\r\n\r\nLoddiges took us to his house and showed his collection of\r\nhumming-birds, which is the finest in the world. He had nearly 200\r\nspecies, and usually several specimens of a kind, very beautifully\r\nmounted and arranged. You can’t imagine how beautiful they are! They are\r\nhis great pets, and I do not wonder. I returned through the City,\r\nstopped a few moments at the British Museum, dined with Joe Hooker at\r\nhis hotel near me, and shortly after saw him start for Glasgow. I sent\r\nby him a copy of “Outre Mer” to Lady Hooker. At nine P.M. I went to the\r\nmeeting of the Royal Society, heard a paper read of the Hon. Fox\r\nTalbot’s on the power of objects not only to sit for, but to draw their\r\nown portraits, which has just been making a great noise in France. It is\r\ndone by the influence of the light of the sun upon paper prepared by\r\nnitrate or chloride of silver. Talbot seems to have found out all about\r\nit long ago, but the French have published first. I will write the\r\ndoctor more particularly about it, and send the “Athenæum” containing\r\nthe account when it appears.\r\n\r\nI have neglected to say that I received two days ago a very kind note\r\nfrom Lindley inviting me to come down to his place, dine with him on\r\nSunday next, stay all night, spend Monday at his herbarium, and meet a\r\nfew botanical friends at dinner, and return next morning. I declined of\r\ncourse the invitation as far as it related to Sunday, but accepted it\r\nfor Monday, and offered to get down to Turnham Green in time to\r\nbreakfast with him. This morning I received another note from him,\r\npointing out the way in which I may reach his house in time. I have also\r\na letter from Francis Bauer, inclosing some European Infusoria, in\r\nreturn for a few of Bailey’s I gave him. I will send a portion to\r\nProfessor Bailey.\r\n\r\nFriday evening, February 1.--I spent the earliest part of the morning in\r\nmy own room; then went to Lambert’s, and commenced the examination of\r\nPursh’s plants. After dining in a simple way by myself, I went to\r\nBentham’s, by appointment, to spend the evening in looking out duplicate\r\nplants. I found him and Mrs. B. sitting cosily together in the study. We\r\nhad a cup of tea and some chat, and then fell to work until half past\r\neleven, when I came away walking as usual by Westminster Abbey, of which\r\nI often get very good nocturnal views.\r\n\r\nSaturday evening, February 2.... Brown has been very kind to me, in his\r\npeculiar way. I have seen him but twice since Hooker and I breakfasted\r\nwith him, but I hope soon to be at work at the British Museum and to see\r\nmore of him. He is very fond of gossip at his own fireside, and amused\r\nus extremely with his dry wit, but in company he is silent and reserved.\r\nI have found out also that it does not do to ask him directly any\r\nquestion about plants. He is, as old Menzies told us, the driest pump\r\nimaginable. But although he will not bear direct squeezing, yet by\r\ncoaxing and very careful management any one he has confidence in may get\r\na good deal out of him. He tells me that Petalanthera, Nutt., is a\r\npublished genus, and promises to give me all the information about it I\r\ndesire. I asked him some question about the manner in which the vessels\r\nof ferns uncoil. He at once remarked, “They unroll like a ribbon”!\r\nQuekett has been examining them, so has a botanist in India; all are\r\nmuch interested in them. I placed Bailey’s specimens afterwards in his\r\nhands and also some of the Infusoria, which he expressed himself much\r\npleased with when I saw him at Lambert’s. By the way, the Infusoria were\r\nsent by Bailey himself. I delivered also the parcel for Lindley, and\r\ngave the rest I had mostly to Dr. Roget, Mr. Lyell,[66] and Francis\r\nBauer, who were all very glad to get them. I have saved a few for Mr.\r\nWard’s microscopical party which he is to give on Wednesday of week\r\nafter next.... I shall also order, for Sullivant, Hooker’s “Icones\r\nPlantarum,” which will be continued, as Hooker furnishes all the matter\r\nfor nothing and gives the plates, finding paper and everything. Although\r\nthere is not so much detail as I could wish, yet it is becoming a very\r\nvaluable collection for a student of natural orders....\r\n\r\nMonday evening.--I have seen the original Taxus nucifera, of Thunberg,\r\nboth leaves and fruit. Arnott should have paid more attention to it. It\r\nis very like Torreya! and doubtless a congener,--and so Brown\r\ninsinuates. I will see more about it soon. A new edition of Lindley’s\r\n“Introduction to Botany” is preparing! Sullivant wants, I suppose, a\r\nmicroscope of single lenses--a good working instrument--and an\r\nachromatic. This last I think I shall procure for him in London, where\r\nthey produce more perfect instruments than the French. Can you send\r\nBentham the Lindernias? He wishes much to examine them; send good\r\ncorollas.\r\n\r\nArnott seems to think much more of Nees von Esenbeck than anybody else.\r\nIt is generally thought he is in his dotage, and a sad, very sad\r\nsplitter of straws....\r\n\r\nI had some thoughts of going to Paris via Leyden, to see if I can coax\r\nanything out of Blume, but he seems to have behaved rather strangely to\r\nall the English botanists I have yet met with. You ask whom I liked best\r\nin Scotland: Hooker is all in all!\r\n\r\nA new Antarctic expedition is planned; indeed is settled upon nearly, to\r\nbe commanded by James Ross. But a part of the administration throw\r\ndifficulties in the way. If it goes Joseph Hooker is to be the\r\nnaturalist.... By the way, Corda’s “Memoir on Impregnation of Plants”\r\nturns out to be mere humbug, and it seems there is little dependence to\r\nbe placed upon him....\r\n\r\nTell Bailey I am every day getting information that will be valuable to\r\nhim, in the microscopical way. I have a new correspondent for him, Mr.\r\nEdwin J. Quekett,[67] 50 Wellclose Square, London, an excellent\r\nmicroscopist. I will write soon what he wants, and he will send through\r\nme some microscopical objects.\r\n\r\nP. S.--I have just had the offer of a chance to examine Walter’s\r\nherbarium as much as I like!--to take it into my possession for a week\r\nif I like! and that after I had nearly given up all hopes of it.\r\n\r\nFebruary 5, eleven o’clock, evening.... I think I mentioned in those\r\nletters how yesterday was spent, viz., that I rose early, took\r\nstagecoach for Turnham Green, near Chiswick, where Lindley resides,\r\nbreakfasted and spent the day. Lindley was certainly very civil. Mrs.\r\nLindley is a quiet lady of plain manners and apparently very domestic\r\nhabits. Miss Drake, whose name appears as the artist in all of Lindley’s\r\nplates almost, was present, and is, I judge, a member of his family, and\r\nperhaps a relative of Mrs. Lindley. I saw Lindley’s splendid “Sertum\r\nOrchidaceum,” and a much more luxurious work, the “Orchidaceæ of Mexico\r\nand Guatemala,” by Bateman, a very large-paper work à l’Audubon. We\r\nlooked over some families together in a desultory way, and I took up the\r\nLupines and compared ours carefully with Lindley’s, which were named by\r\nAgardh. At dinner met Dr. Quekett and Mr. Miers,[68] a traveler in\r\nBrazil. On reaching my room I found a note from Bell, the zoölogist (to\r\nwhom I brought a letter from John Carey, but left at his house, not\r\nbeing able to see him), inviting me dine as his guest at the Linnæan\r\nClub, before the meeting of the Linnæan Society. Fortunately, as I do\r\nnot like club-dinners, I had previously accepted Bentham’s invitation to\r\ndine quietly with him and Mrs. B. on that day, so I sent a note of\r\ndeclinature. I have already told you of my failure, by my own\r\ncarelessness, of seeing the opening of Parliament, which I regret, as I\r\nshould like to see the peers in official costume, and the peeresses in\r\nfull dress.\r\n\r\nIt did not break my heart, but I returned to Bentham’s and looked over\r\nplants until the hour approached to take my place in the park to see the\r\nqueen, and--what is finer--her superb horses, with what success I have\r\nalready said; thence to the Horticultural Society, where I received the\r\nwelcome letters. After dispatching my parcel of letters I took a cab\r\nfor Bentham’s, as it was raining finely, where we dined in his quiet,\r\nelegant way. I don’t think Dr. Torrey saw enough of him, at least in his\r\nown house, to appreciate him fully....\r\n\r\nYou may well infer from my being so much with him that he is my\r\nfavorite....\r\n\r\nWednesday evening.--After breakfast to-day I went to Lambert’s, thinking\r\nto finish nearly the examination of Pursh’s plants, but I found Lambert\r\non the point of going out, though the morning was unpleasant. So I was\r\nobliged to retrace my steps; and as a dernier ressort I went to the\r\nBritish Museum, and commenced my examination of the Banksian Herbarium.\r\nBrown was there most of the time, but did very little except to read the\r\nnewspaper and crack his jokes. I broke off at four o’clock; went down to\r\nthe City, called on Mr. Putnam, took a parcel of late American\r\nnewspapers away with me, dined, went up to Dr. Boott’s, where I spent\r\nthe evening so pleasantly that eleven o’clock arrived before I thought\r\nof it. It is now twelve. On my return here I found my parcel had arrived\r\nfrom Edinburgh, the beautiful copy of Wallich’s work, a very complete\r\nand pretty set of British Algæ from Dr. Greville, and some letters of\r\nintroduction for the Continent which he has obligingly favored me with.\r\nI must write a letter of thanks to-morrow....\r\n\r\nWent to Ward’s to see the tunnel.... We had tea, Miss and Mrs. Ward\r\nregaled us with music,--and both play extremely well; then Ward and I\r\nlooked over plants until nearly half past ten, when we had supper, a\r\nvery substantial one, and I took my leave, arriving at my lodgings a\r\nlittle after twelve....\r\n\r\nSunday evening, February 10.... This morning I attended one of the\r\nlarger Methodist chapels, where I heard an excellent sermon from 1 Pet.\r\nv. 7: “Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.” A portion\r\nof the Episcopal service was read at the beginning from the desk; but\r\nafterwards the clergyman ascended to the pulpit, when the singing and\r\nprayers were in the ordinary manner. In the afternoon I went to hear my\r\nold favorite Baptist Noel, who was to preach a kind of charity sermon\r\nfor the infant-schools of St. Clement’s, Danes. I felt satisfied that we\r\nshould have a close and fervent sermon, and truly I was not\r\ndisappointed.... He preaches ex tempore, but has the most perfect\r\nfacility of language; the words drop from his mouth without any apparent\r\neffort, but he never repeats, and all seems equally important; so unless\r\nI could write as fast as he speaks I could give you no proper idea of\r\nhis discourse. His manner is so exceedingly placid that you wonder how\r\nhe fixes the attention of his auditors so perfectly. There are many\r\nother clergymen who have the same ardent piety, and the number I hope is\r\nincreasing; so that one cannot help expecting great things from this\r\ncommunion, if it once gets free from the contaminating influence of the\r\npolitical power. These men all preach continually to crowded houses,\r\nwhich is another good sign, and proves that the people are ready to hear\r\nsound doctrine. I hoped to have heard another of the same stamp this\r\nevening, and went all the way to St. Sepulere’s, where Mr. Dale preaches\r\nin the evening, but he was out of town....\r\n\r\nFebruary 5, evening.--It is not long since I closed a parcel of letters\r\nfor you, and dispatched them by mail to Liverpool, for the steamship\r\nLiverpool, by which I hope they will reach you early. I have since\r\nattended a meeting of the Linnæan Society, Mr. Forster in the chair.\r\nLambert never comes now for fear of meeting Don, and also because he is\r\na little piqued, perhaps at not being made president. Brown seldom\r\ncomes, as he would have to take the chair in Lambert’s absence, and he\r\nfears he might annoy Lambert, for Brown is extremely tender of other\r\npersons’ feelings. I was most interested in the nominations to fill up\r\nthe five vacancies of the foreign associates. They were Carus,\r\nMilne-Edwards, Dutrochet, Endlicher, and Torrey. The nomination was\r\nsigned by Bentham, Brown, Boott, Forster, Owen, etc. I knew nothing of\r\nit till just before the meeting, and I may be allowed to say that I felt\r\nextremely gratified at such a very handsome compliment paid to my best\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nLindley has given me to-day a copy of Griffith’s most admirable paper in\r\nthe last part of the “Transactions Linnæan Society,” on the ovula of\r\nSantalum, Loranthuns, Viscum, etc., an anatomical paper of the very\r\nhighest order,--about forty pages, with eleven fine plates. I am going\r\nto buy all the other papers on Botany in the Linnæean Transactions which\r\nI think valuable. They can be had of Coxhead, who buys sets and pulls\r\nthem to pieces to sell separately. Let me not forget to tell you that,\r\nafter having made diligent inquiry of Brown, Bentham, etc., I had nearly\r\ngiven up all hopes of finding Walter’s[69] herbarium. I spoke to Lindley\r\nyesterday, and he said he knew the son of old Fraser, who would be most\r\napt to know something about it, and would give me his address, by which\r\nI could find him if in town. But to-day, just after the adjournment of\r\nthe Horticultural Society, and while I was glancing over your kind\r\nletters, Lindley came to say that he had found Walter’s herbarium for\r\nme! He introduced me to Mr. Fraser, to whom it belongs, though not\r\nimmediately in his possession, who offered to send it up for my\r\nexamination to the Horticultural Society’s rooms, or anywhere I chose. I\r\nhope to get at it, with Bentham, about Friday. I shall be anxious to let\r\nyou know the result....\r\n\r\nI am most clearly of the opinion that any person who will make extensive\r\ncollections of North American plants, both Northern and Southern, and\r\ninclude also a good collection from Santa Fé, the Platte country, etc.,\r\nhave his sets named according to our work, and who would devote four or\r\nfive years to the business, could, if he were really industrious and\r\nprudent, realize $1000 per annum (clear). He should continue my\r\ngrass-book for one thing, giving loose sets only for the present price,\r\nand while from time to time he sells off collections as he can, should\r\nretain some fifty sets in all the most interesting genera or small\r\nfamilies, get all the species, and publish them in monographic sets.\r\nKnieskern could make, with the aid we would gladly furnish, at least ten\r\ntimes as much money, as long as he lives, as he ever will at physic,\r\nbesides being engaged in a much pleasanter way. I know how all this\r\nshould be managed now. Now for Dr. Clapp. Tell him that Brown informs me\r\nthat he does not think jewel lenses can be depended upon as possessing\r\nany advantage over glass. He has an excellent sapphire one, but that is\r\na mere chance, and no other has been made anything like it. They are now\r\nalmost never made, and appear to be going wholly out of use. His other\r\nmatters I will take in hand, but he must not expect $20 to procure a\r\ndoublet 1/40th inch focus, two micrometer glasses, and a case of\r\ndissecting instruments. I have some engagements before me with\r\nmicroscopical people, and when I get from them all the information I\r\ncan, I will set about these affairs more understandingly....\r\n\r\nSaturday evening, February 9.--I have been engaged nearly the whole day\r\nupon the herbarium you so much wished to examine, viz., that of Walter.\r\nI have not yet finished it, and find the examination very tedious, as\r\nthe specimens are very often not labeled, except with the genus in his\r\n“Flora,” so that I have first to make out his own species, and then what\r\nthey are of succeeding authors.\r\n\r\nThe specimens are mostly mere bits, pasted down in a huge folio volume.\r\nI suspect this was done by Fraser, and the labels have sometimes been\r\nexchanged, so that it requires no little patience. Some of the things I\r\nmost wished to see are not in the collection, and there are several in\r\nthe collection which are not mentioned in the “Flora.” You would laugh\r\nto see what some of the things are that have puzzled us: thus, for\r\ninstance, his “Cucubalus polypetalus” is Saponaria officinalis! His\r\n“Dianthus Carolinianus” is Frasera! in fruit. I will soon send you my\r\nnotes on the collection, or a copy of them. Bentham looked over the\r\nLeguminosæ, Labiatæ, etc., with me. I have had two sittings at Pursh,\r\nbut have not yet finished; I hope another day will do it, but am not\r\ncertain. I shall still require about three days more at the British\r\nMuseum, two at the Linnæan Society, and one at Lindley’s. An evening or\r\ntwo at Bentham’s will suffice to certify his Labiatæ, Scrophularinæ,\r\netc. I must also have a day with Brown, if I can get it at his own\r\nhouse. I hope very nearly to finish this next week, if life and health\r\nare continued....\r\n\r\nFebruary 12, 1839.--I am fearful even another day will not see the end\r\nof Lambert’s collection, and I suspect a week is none too little for the\r\nBritish Museum. Lady Charlotte Bury came into Lambert’s and had a long\r\nchat with him; such a pair of originals! She is to dine with Lambert on\r\nSunday, but stipulated early, as she always made it a point to read\r\nprayers to her servants on Sunday evening!\r\n\r\nFebruary 13, Wednesday evening, or rather one o’clock, Thursday.--Rose\r\nand breakfasted at eight, which is become my regular practice; started\r\nfor Lambert’s at ten, where I worked incessantly till five P.M.;\r\nreturned to my room; dressed; went to the City, where I dined, and about\r\neight o’clock arrived at Ward’s, whose microscopical party this evening\r\nwas given chiefly on my account. Some eight or more splendid microscopes\r\nwere in active use when I arrived; and the greater portion of the chief\r\nmicroscopic people were there. I was introduced to Stokes, Solly, Powel,\r\nBowerbank[70].... Also Mr. Quekett, whom I knew before, and several\r\namateurs, such as Boott, Bennett, Bentham, Don, were present. It was a\r\nfeast to me, you may be sure, and I acquired some useful knowledge, and\r\nsaw some strange things: the infusoria in flint; queer fossil woods,\r\nwhich are all the rage here, and are extremely curious; fibrocellular\r\ntissue, the most beautiful thing you can imagine. One of the best of the\r\nmicroscopists, Mr. Bowerbank, gave me one or two curious microscopical\r\nobjects, which he had mounted for himself, and made an appointment with\r\nme and another friend to meet him on Monday evening next, to examine his\r\nmicroscopes and curious objects more quietly and at large than could be\r\ndone in a crowd, and to prepare some specimens for me. Mr. Reade, a\r\ngentleman who was invited, but was prevented from attending, was so kind\r\nas to send me a copy of his paper on the Infusoria and Scales of Fishes\r\nfound in Flint, with proof impressions which are far superior to those\r\nin the “Annals of Natural History.” ...\r\n\r\nTuesday evening, February 19.--Three days have passed since I have\r\nwritten a line for you. This suspension was occasioned by my late hours\r\nlast night. After spending the morning at the Horticultural Society,\r\nthen going into the City, where I dined, then going far out on the\r\nMile-End Road to deliver a letter intrusted to me by Mr. Scatcherd, then\r\nreturning as far as the Bank, I went again, partly by omnibus and partly\r\non my legs, almost as far in the northern outskirts of the town, to\r\nspend an evening with Mr. Bowerbank, one of the best microscopists in\r\nLondon, who owns the best microscope. I found so much to see that I did\r\nnot get away until past twelve, and then I had a walk before me almost\r\nthe whole length of London,--from New North Road to Charing Cross. I had\r\nan opportunity of seeing, what was especially promised me, the camera\r\nlucida applied to the microscope; an invaluable invention for an awkward\r\nperson like me, as I am convinced I could with a very little practice\r\nturn out very fair outline sketches of objects I might be examining. I\r\nacquired much information on various subjects; saw some most curious and\r\nunique specimens of vegetable structure, and particularly of fossil\r\nfruits, of which Mr. Bowerbank possesses an invaluable collection;\r\ncapsules, which we broke open, and examined not only the seed, with its\r\ntesta, raphe, and funiculus, but even the pulp which surrounded it. I\r\nlooked at many of his specimens of recent and fossil wood, at his\r\nunrivaled cabinet of British fossils, and when our party broke up, there\r\nwas still so much left that we made an appointment for another\r\nevening.... Mr. Bentham, Mr. Brydges, and I went to the Linnæan Society;\r\nthe president, the Bishop of Norwich, was in the chair,--an amiable old\r\ngentleman. Boott, Yarrell, Ward, Royle, Forster, et multis aliis, were\r\npresent. Mr. Forster[71] invited Dr. Boott and me to fix a day to visit\r\nhim at his residence, some miles in the country, and dine with him. He\r\nis greatly esteemed, and is said to be one of the most kind-hearted and\r\nbenevolent of men. I am now engaged, I believe, for every day and\r\nevening of this week, and half of next, and am busy enough, I assure\r\nyou....\r\n\r\nFriday evening, February 22.--I ought hardly to use the date of Friday\r\nevening, as it is close upon one o’clock of Saturday morning. But I must\r\nnot neglect my journal, and shall therefore give you a few hasty lines\r\nere I prepare for rest. I passed yesterday morning at the British\r\nMuseum, that is, until near three o’clock. I then hurried to my\r\nlodgings, snatched a hasty dinner by the way, and went to the House of\r\nCommons, Mr. Bentham having, through Dr. Romily, the speaker’s clerk,\r\nprocured me an order of admittance within the body of the house, where I\r\nhad the finest opportunity for hearing and seeing. There was nothing\r\nvery important brought before the house, yet on different subjects\r\nnearly all the leading officers of the administration took the floor,\r\nMr. Rice, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord John Russell, who is\r\nevidently a man of most ready talent and tact, Lord Palmerston, Lord\r\nMorpeth, the new member of the cabinet, etc. I was exceedingly amused by\r\nthe manner in which Lord John Russell worsted a Colonel Sibthorpe, an\r\nopposition member, who moved certain resolutions relative to Lord\r\nDurham’s expenses, couched in an offensive manner, and made a still more\r\nobjectionable speech. Lord J. Russell, in very placid manner, set him\r\nout in such a ridiculous light, that the gallant colonel first lost his\r\ntemper completely, and then lost his point, being obliged to withdraw\r\nhis own resolutions. I heard also, for a moment, Sir Robert Peel, Dr.\r\nLushington, Mr. Hume, and others too tedious to enumerate. As to general\r\ndecorum, or the manner in which members often treat each other in\r\ndebate, I don’t think we have much to learn....\r\n\r\nI spent this morning at the British Museum; dined with Mr. Putnam at a\r\nchop-house, and went to spend the evening at Mr. Quekett’s. I found,\r\ninstead of having the evening alone as I expected and wished, that he\r\nhad invited several friends, most of whom I knew. Still, after tea the\r\nmicroscopes were produced, and I had the opportunity of examining very\r\nmany curious things.\r\n\r\nIf they don’t get out of my head in the mean time I will try to mention\r\nsome of them to Dr. Torrey when I go on with my letter to him. As eating\r\nis a very important matter here, we had a magnificent supper at half\r\npast ten, and it was near twelve when I left, with a walk of four miles\r\nbefore me....\r\n\r\nSaturday evening.--This has been a busy and somewhat interesting day\r\nwith me. I rose early, went down to Bentham’s to breakfast, stayed until\r\neleven o’clock, and then went up to Brown’s house to spend the morning,\r\naccording to previous appointment. We talked profound botanical matters,\r\nand Brown not only amused and interested me, but gave me much valuable\r\ninformation. He talks of visiting America, possibly next summer, and I\r\nhave promised to plan him a route. I left him about four o’clock,\r\nreturned to my lodgings, dressed hastily, took a Kensington omnibus, and\r\nreached old Mr. Menzies’ little place at five. Mr. Ward, who was to meet\r\nus, was not there. We left at half past ten, and walked all the way\r\nback, about four miles. So here I am safe again. I read over the\r\ndoctor’s short letter again. I am trying to imagine how Herbert looks\r\nnow. He has probably changed very much since I parted from him. I have a\r\nvery especial love for that little fellow.[72] I must find time to write\r\nto the girls, yet fear I shall scarcely be able until I have left\r\nLondon. Tell them I think of them daily even if I cannot write them. As\r\nto M’s French letter, it is not due until I get to France; but that\r\nwill, I trust, be soon. Adieu. Good-night.\r\n\r\nSunday, February 24. I was fortunate this morning in being able to hear\r\na man I had heard spoken of, and of whom I had formed a high opinion:\r\nthe Rev. Thomas Dale, Vicar of St. Bride’s, who also preaches in the\r\nevening at St. Sepulcre’s. He preached from the first part of Luke vii.\r\n47: “Her sins, which are many, are forgiven; for she loved much.” The\r\ndiscourse was truly evangelical and impressive. He is the best preacher\r\nI have heard in England next to Mr. Noel, and is more eloquent and\r\nstriking in manner than he, but has not the gentle pathos and sweetness\r\nof Noel....\r\n\r\nTuesday evening, February 26.... Met Mr. Putnam[73] at half past four.\r\nWe had arranged beforehand that he should attempt to procure some orders\r\nfor admittance to the House of Lords, and that we should go down\r\ntogether. I found he had been successful, having sent his clerk with\r\nnotes to some half dozen peers in order to make sure, and he thus\r\nobtained more orders than he wanted. For me I found he had addressed a\r\nnote in my name to the Bishop of London, who very promptly sent me an\r\norder of admittance.\r\n\r\nWe set out accordingly. The room which is occupied by the House of Lords\r\ntemporarily, until the New Houses of Parliament are built, is inferior\r\nin size and accommodation to that of the Commons; indeed there is\r\nnothing about it at all remarkable. There was no business of very\r\nabsorbing interest before the House this evening, and it adjourned as\r\nearly as eight. Still I had the good fortune to hear nearly all those\r\nspeak that I particularly cared for except Wellington (who is sick) and\r\nEarl Durham. I heard a long speech from Brougham and a very good one,\r\nexcept that he took occasion to trumpet his own good works. There was\r\nsome fine sparring between an Irish lord I do not remember, Lord Roden,\r\nLord Westmeath, and Lord Normanby, the late viceroy of Ireland, a young\r\nman apparently, and a man of talent, Melbourne, and Minto; the lord\r\nchancellor, Denman the chief justice, Sir James Scarlett, old Lord\r\nHolland, etc., also spoke. The word “lengthy,” which was not long since\r\ncalled an Americanism, seems to be pretty well naturalized, as Brougham\r\nused it several times, and Scarlett more than once. Lord Palmerston the\r\nother evening used the word “ disculpate” instead of “exculpate,” which\r\nI fancy is rather modern English....\r\n\r\nFriday evening, 12 o’clock, March 1.--I have just returned from a most\r\npleasant evening and day, as I may say, spent at Mr. Forster’s beautiful\r\nresidence on the border of Epping Forest, Essex (Woodford), about ten\r\nmiles from here. He is an old man, a banker, one of the oldest\r\nvice-presidents of the Linnæan Society, one of the most kind-hearted\r\nmen, exceedingly beloved. He lives in an elegant but very unostentatious\r\nway, in a most beautiful part of the country, the very perfection of\r\nEnglish scenery. He is said to be extremely benevolent, and to do a\r\nworld of good....\r\n\r\nSaturday evening.--Immediately after breakfast this morning I went down\r\nto Bentham, whom I had not seen for a week; spent two or three hours\r\nthere, returned again to my lodgings, went to the City, took an early\r\ndinner with Mr. Putnam, and then we went together in an omnibus to\r\nHackney; saw Loddiges’ extensive collections of fine plants again,\r\nlovely Orchideæ. The Camellias, of which he has a large house filled\r\nwith magnificent trees, were not yet in bloom.\r\n\r\n... We walked across this eastern part of the city down to the Tower,\r\nentered the gates and walked over the grounds. It was too late to get\r\nentrance to the armory or any of the interesting places, as the light\r\nwas beginning to fail. I went back to Mr. Ward’s, at Well-close Square,\r\naccording to promise, to name some plants for him, but Dr.\r\nValentine,[74] a most ingenious vegetable anatomist and microscopist,\r\nbeing in town (had previously met him at Lindley’s), Mr. Ward had\r\nforegone his own advantage and invited Valentine and Quekett to meet me\r\nwith their microscopes, so that the evening was very instructive to me,\r\nwhich I had not anticipated. Mr. Ward seems to have taken a fancy to me,\r\nfor I can hardly imagine that he takes so much pains to oblige every\r\none, absorbed as he is also in medical practice. He presented me with a\r\nbeautiful botanical digger of fine polished steel, with a leathern\r\nsheath, which I suspect he has had made on purpose for me; though I\r\ndon’t know why he should have thought of it. Mrs. Ward was inquiring\r\nabout the Abbotts and their works, one of which she had, which makes her\r\nwish for more. I am often asked about Mr. Abbott, whose works seem much\r\nmore generally known here than those of any other American religious\r\nauthor. I must find some for Mrs. Ward.\r\n\r\nSunday evening, March 3.--I went this morning to hear, perhaps for the\r\nlast time, Baptist Noel. The sermon was from the last three verses of\r\nthe same psalm (Ps. ciii.) from which he has preached on the former\r\noccasions when I have heard him in his own church; and truly a good\r\nsermon it was. I have told you that the chapel is a large one. Yet it is\r\nso well filled that I have always had some difficulty in getting a seat,\r\nand to-day I actually stood near the pulpit during the whole service and\r\nsermon. But it is worth while submitting to some inconvenience. In the\r\nafternoon I walked up to Tottenham Court Road, and looked up the chapel\r\nbuilt by Whitfield, the scene of his useful labors in London. If you\r\nread, as I think you did, Philip’s “Life of Whitfield,” you must take\r\nsome interest in this place.[75] I found the chapel a large but\r\noutlandish building, with an inscription over one of the entrances,\r\nstating that the building was erected by George Whitfield. Within is a\r\ntablet to the memory of Mrs. Whitfield, who is buried here, and a\r\nmonumental inscription to Whitfield himself (which I regret I did not\r\ncopy), mentioning the date of his death at Newburyport, near Boston. The\r\npreacher this afternoon (for I believe there is more than one who\r\nofficiates here) was the Rev. Mr. Wight, who gave an impressive,\r\npractical sermon from the concluding clause of the last verse of Romans\r\nviii.: “The love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” It was, I\r\nthink, rather above his audience, which I am sorry to say was\r\nexceedingly small. Indeed I hope it is generally better filled, but I\r\nshould not have expected so great a falling off in the attendance of\r\nplain unfashionable people in the afternoon. These Whitfieldians are,\r\none would think, farther separated from the Established Church than\r\nWesleyans (which was certainly not the case in Whitfield’s time, who\r\nrefused to take any steps to establish a sect apart from the Church of\r\nEngland); for in the Wesleyan chapel I attended the liturgy was read,\r\nbut here we had none of it. Only last summer I read a biography of\r\nWhitfield with much attention; and it was very interesting to worship in\r\nthis chapel of his. It recalls more interesting associations than\r\nWestminster Abbey or any vast and splendid cathedral. But I must bid\r\nyou good-night, purposing to rise early and have an hour or so before\r\nthe pressing business of the day is commenced to write another sheet to\r\nyou and our good Dr. Torrey, to whom I have so much to say, if I could\r\never find time for it.\r\n\r\nFriday.--I have been to-day at the British Museum, studying from the\r\nspecimens of Plukenet, Catesby, Miller, etc., etc., the authority for\r\nold Linnæan species in Ilex, Prinos, Eupatorium, etc. It is slow and\r\ntedious work, and I shall not have time to do so much of it as I could\r\nwish. Brown told me to-day about Petalanthera. It is Cevallis, Lagasca,\r\nHortus Matritensis, and very probably his species, even C. sinuata. It\r\ncame from New Spain. You will see Lindley is all astray about the genus,\r\nand no one knows its affinities even, but Brown. Lagasca himself refers\r\nit to Boragineæ. It is true Loaseæ. I was this evening at Bentham’s, and\r\nfound he had a specimen of C. sinuata from Hooker, collected by Brydges\r\nin Mexico, I think. I have asked Brown to give us some notes on the\r\nsubject, a generic character, etc., that we may publish a little from\r\nhis own pen. I am to spend a day with him next week, and I will try to\r\nget something out of him. He hinted to me some days ago that he knew\r\nsomething about Cyrilla, but I could not get it out of him. I’ll try\r\nagain. He tells me he has a character to distinguish true Rhexia, which\r\nhas escaped Don, De Candolle, etc. We must find it out. Bentham has\r\ngiven me his “Scrophulariæ Indicæ,” and the three last parts of his\r\n“Labiatæ;” I have bought the rest (£1 2s. 6d.), and last evening we\r\nlooked over his North American specimens, and the notes in his copy. He\r\ngave me also, the other day, the only published part of the “Plantæ\r\nHugelianæ” and a few other pamphlets. He is a liberal soul.\r\n\r\nI have got so far behind in my botanical news that I despair of bringing\r\nup arrears, and must leave very much to tell you in propria persona, if\r\nwe meet again. I fancy I have not very much new to learn on the\r\nContinent about microscopes and modes of working. I have seen much of\r\nall the best people here, last not least Valentine, who lives in the\r\ncountry, from whom I have derived much useful knowledge. He works to\r\nsome account, which can’t be said of most here, who, though they have\r\nthe best instruments in the world, don’t turn them to any important\r\naccount. As to Sullivant, tell him to have great patience. I can get him\r\na capital simple microscope by Ross for six guineas, but I want to get\r\nas useful a one for him cheaper, so I shall wait till I have been on the\r\nContinent, I think. My plan is to purchase at Paris for him, where the\r\nlow powers are good as can be, and supply a lens or two here....\r\n\r\nChapmannia (!) exists in Bartram’s old collection here, which you saw at\r\nBritish Museum, and some other very lately published things.\r\n\r\nI bought a copy of “Flora” for Bennett the other day, thinking it worth\r\nwhile to offer him something, as I was taking up much of his time.\r\nTo-day he gave me a copy of the published part of the “Plantæ Javanicæ\r\nRariores,” (£2 10s., plain, is the publishing price), an invaluable\r\nwork, containing very many notes and observations on various genera,\r\netc., both by Brown and himself, which it is quite necessary we should\r\nsee. The notes I have made for the last few days are not now before me,\r\nso that I cannot now give you any remarks. There is no one thing of very\r\nconsiderable importance, but much small matter. By the way, let me say\r\nthat Bennett thinks that Brown thinks Romanzovia to be hydrophyllaceous!\r\nBentham would give something to know this, but I shall keep it to\r\nmyself. I have made out the remainder of Pursh’s doubtful Arenarias and\r\nStellarias front the Banks herbarium. The parcel of Solidagos, etc.,\r\nsent to care of Mr. Putnam, I am glad to say, came to hand. It did not\r\narrive until last week, however....\r\n\r\nMonday evening, twelve o’clock.... As I sit down to tell you what I have\r\nbeen about to-day, my thoughts cross the wide wave that separates us,\r\nand brings me back to 30 MacDougal Street, and to the time when,\r\nreturning from town, I used to present myself before you, give an\r\naccount of my proceedings, tell you perhaps some news about that\r\nill-fated expedition of which you were so sick of hearing; how it would\r\ncertainly sail in a month, or something just as likely. When thinking of\r\nthis long separation, I console myself with the idea that it is better\r\nthan if I had gone there. In that case I should now have been your\r\nantipodes. Now there are only some four or five hours of shadow between\r\nus. And, sluggard as you call me at home, I am up in the morning two or\r\nthree hours before you. Tell that to the girls for a wonder! I left my\r\nroom this morning at eleven, walked to Portland Place, called on the\r\nAmerican minister, who being unwell I was furnished by the secretary of\r\nlegation with what I desired, namely, a passport. This I left, as the\r\nmanner is, at the office of the French embassy, that his majesty Louis\r\nPhilippe may have fitting notice of the honor that is to be done him,\r\nfor the king of the French is, it seems, rather particular abut such\r\nmatters, and it is a pity not to oblige him, especially as you can’t\r\nhelp yourself. This being done I went on to the Linnæan Society, and by\r\nworking at the full stretch of my powers contrived to get through the\r\nLinnæan herbarium (skipping a few genera now and then) about six\r\no’clock. Returned home pretty well fatigued, took some tea and toast,\r\ncalled upon Bentham, whom I found writing letters of introduction for\r\nme. I have them now before me. They are addressed to Seringe at Lyons;\r\nRequien, Avignon; Lady Bentham (B.’s mother) at Montpellier, with\r\nrequest to make me acquainted with Dunal and Delile; Moretti at Pavia;\r\nVisiani at Padua; Tomasini at Triest; Unger at Gratz; Endlicher at\r\nVienna; Martius and Schultes at Munich; Reichenbach at Dresden; Pöppig\r\nat Leipsic. These, with what I have already from Hooker, Arnott,\r\nGreville, Boott, etc., with a few that I expect at Paris, leave me\r\nlittle to wish for in this respect. About ten o’clock went to Mrs.\r\nStevenson’s party. It was not a very large one, and in no way especially\r\nremarkable. I found there of course the Bootts (three sizes, viz., Mrs.\r\nBoott the grandmother, Mrs. Boott the mother, and Miss Boott the\r\ndaughter) and so of course I was upon good footing. Our minister lives\r\nin neat but by no means splendid style, quite enough so for a\r\nrepublican; and Mrs. S. is very lady-like and prepossessing in\r\nappearance. Mr. Stevenson did not make his appearance. Of course, I did\r\nnot stay long.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nPoor Hunneman died yesterday, after a short illness. I have spent much\r\ntime evenings with Mr. Valentine, whom I like extremely. Excepting only\r\nBrown, he is the best microscopical observer in Great Britain. He cares\r\nlittle, however, for proper systematic botany, for which I am sorry. He\r\nhas shown me some curious things.\r\n\r\nI have learned from Brown the character he observed in our species of\r\nRhexia, that is, the true genus Rhexia: the unilocularity of the\r\nanthers....\r\n\r\nTuesday evening, March 12.--After a hard day’s work I finished on Monday\r\nevening with the Linnæan herbarium, which I found more interesting than\r\nI expected and more satisfactory, as it is in really good state,\r\ncarefully taken care of, etc. I had some very good notes to make. I\r\nassure you I feel much gratified to have studied this collection, which,\r\nwith the Gronovian, enables us to start fair as to Linnæan species. Do\r\nyou know that Acer saccharinum, Linn., is A. eriocarpum (spec. Kalm)!\r\nLook at Linnæus “Species Plantarum” (which you have not, unfortunately,\r\nthough it is the most necessary of books; you will receive it at the\r\nsame time as this letter or nearly) and you will find that the\r\ndescription is all drawn from Eriocarpum.\r\n\r\nI took what time I could to-day for the Gronovian plants and a few of\r\nPlukenet’s, etc., but was unable to finish; will go to-morrow, for I\r\nshall work to the last moment.\r\n\r\nI have been tempted to buy a collection of Hartweg’s[76] very fine\r\nMexican plants, which being collected far in the interior of north\r\nMexico are very North American, and quite necessary, I think, for us.\r\nThey will reach you with the other parcels. Be careful about the little\r\nlabels with the numbers stuck on. Bentham will publish them\r\npresently....\r\n\r\nProfessor Royle, as the agent of India people, I believe, offers me\r\nseeds from Himalaya Mountains, received, and still to be received, from\r\nthe government collectors, in exchange for those of useful and\r\ninteresting North American plants, which they are desirous of\r\nintroducing into India. But as I can’t attend to it until another\r\nseason, he kindly offers to send to you a portion of the seeds just\r\nreceived, and to ask you to distribute them in such way as will be most\r\nuseful, and ask those you give them to (say Downing, Hogg, Dr. Wray, Dr.\r\nBoykin, etc., and some one in the valley of the Mississippi or Arkansas)\r\nto collect seeds of trees, etc. (you can suggest what would be most\r\ndesirable), and send them to London, whence they will be sent in the\r\nmails overland to India. As I fear I shall not see Royle again I shall\r\nwrite him a note, telling him, as I promised, how to send to you.\r\n\r\nI saw Dr. Sims’ herbarium, at King’s College. I want to look at it to\r\ncertify a few early “Botanical Magazine” plants.\r\n\r\nBrown came to the museum this morning with a copy of a curious late\r\npaper of Schleiden (which I had seen before) on the Development of the\r\nEmbryo, with a parcel of his own notes on the same subject made in 1810,\r\n1812, 1815, etc., which did not altogether correspond. Brown thinks much\r\nof Schleiden as an observer. He read me many of his old notes, and the\r\nsubject took him to speak of his discoveries with regard to the embryos\r\nof Pinus. To explain to me as he went on he drew the diagram on the\r\ninclosed slip of paper, and pointed out to me how to observe in our\r\nspecies of Pinus. This will refresh my memory as to all he told me, so\r\npray keep it safely. There is much very curious matter now afloat about\r\nthe process of impregnation and the early development of embryo, which I\r\nam accumulating, as much as I can, for future use. Pray tell Dr. Perrine\r\nthat the gardeners and botanists here insist by acclamation almost that\r\nthere is no such thing as acclimation in the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nWhat a pickle the Linnæan Ascyrum is in! I wish I had room to tell you.\r\n\r\nTO MRS. TORREY.\r\n\r\nTuesday morning, two o’clock A.M., March 14, 1839.\r\n\r\nI have just finished packing up, being about to start for Boulogne in\r\nsteamboat at nine o’clock this morning, and I must now hastily close my\r\nletters. This, or rather yesterday, has been a busy day with me. I\r\nstarted in the morning to have a look at a few more things of Pursh’s at\r\nLambert’s, but he kept me longer than I liked. He found somewhere a\r\nsmall parcel of plants collected by Eschscholz in Kotzebne’s voyage, who\r\nsent them to Lambert. Lambert gave me all the North American ones, few\r\nto be sure, but interesting. From Lambert’s I returned by way of the\r\nHorticultural Society, to bid good-by to Lindley and Bentham, but the\r\nlatter insists upon coming up in the morning to my lodgings to see me\r\noff. I have made a fortunate acquisition for him. He told me he saw, a\r\nfew days ago, at an auction some copies of Richard’s fine work on the\r\nConiferæ, but an engagement at the time prevented him from staying to\r\nbuy a copy of the work for himself, which he imagined would be sold\r\ncheap. Mr. Putnam found out who bought up these copies, and obtained one\r\nat nearly the price at which they were sold. I shall have the pleasure\r\nof presenting it to Bentham this morning when he calls. I went to the\r\nBritish Museum, worked hard until four o’clock; but was not able quite\r\nto finish, so I left my copy of Gronovius, in which I was making notes,\r\nwith Mr. Bennett to keep for me until my return in the autumn, and took\r\nleave of Brown and Bennett. Went to Dr. Boott’s; saw Mrs. and Miss\r\nBoott, who insisted upon giving me a note of introduction to a friend of\r\ntheirs in Florence; went to the City, dined with Putnam, down to\r\nWell-close Square, took my tea, and bid good-by to Ward and family, and\r\nMr. Quekett....\r\n\r\nTO THE MISSES TORREY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, March 18, 1839, Monday evening.\r\n\r\nI am now at the Hotel de l’Empereur Joseph II., Rue Tournon, près du\r\nPalais du Luxembourg. Here I have been established for about half an\r\nhour, and my first business shall be to fill this sheet for you. I\r\nsuppose I must begin at the beginning and tell you how I came here.\r\nVoilà. I left London at nine o’clock in the morning of the 14th inst.\r\n(Thursday), stopping on my way to the steamboat which was to take me to\r\nBoulogne, to leave a parcel of letters at Mr. Putnam’s office, to be\r\nforwarded to dear friends at home. It was a nasty, rainy morning; and\r\nour boat was, as indeed I expected, not very comfortable. The cabin was\r\nwell enough, but much too small for the accommodation of some fifty or\r\nsixty persons, and there was no covering to the deck, nor any\r\ndeck-cabin, except two dirty little places for the poorer passengers,\r\nwho were not allowed the use of ours; so we had our choice the whole day\r\nbetween the soaking in the rain upon the deck and the close atmosphere\r\nof the crowded cabin. Of course I was vibrating between the two dilemmas\r\nthe whole day, but took as much pains as I could to keep dry. The only\r\nthing I saw worthy of notice as we went down the Thames was Greenwich\r\nHospital, of which I will perhaps send a print. I should add also chalk\r\ncliffs, for I never before saw rocks and hills of chalk. In the\r\nafternoon, as we had fairly got into the Channel, a thick fog came on.\r\nThe captain lost his way and seemed in fear that he should run the boat\r\nupon the Sands, so he dropped anchor about five in the afternoon. We\r\nwere to have arrived at Boulogne at nine that evening. But as I saw\r\nthere was no great chance of our moving for some time, I set about\r\nmaking amends for my loss of sleep the previous night. I took possession\r\nof two thirds of a hard sofa, and, wrapped in my cloak, was soon in a\r\ncomfortable doze. I awoke late in the evening; and such a sight as there\r\nwas before me! It seems that there were no accommodations for sleeping\r\non board, or next to none, and the passengers, men, women, and children,\r\nwere indiscriminately but thickly strewn over the sofas, chairs, and\r\neven over the whole floor, with portmanteaus, great-coats, and whatever\r\nthey could find for pillows, attempting to secure such rest as they\r\ncould,--some sixty persons or more crowded into a space not larger than\r\nthe cabin of one of our ferry-boats....\r\n\r\nBut I was too drowsy to mind it much, and soon fell asleep again, but\r\nawoke in the morning with swollen eyes and complaining bones. The boat\r\nwas moving again, and it was raining as hard as ever. The distant coast\r\nof France soon came in view, and at half past ten we were landed at\r\nBoulogne. We were escorted to the custom-house; what baggage we had\r\nbrought in our hands was closely examined by the officers, an\r\nill-looking, vagabond set; our passports were taken from us and\r\nprovisional ones given, which permitted us to go on to Paris, and for\r\nwhich we each had to pay two francs; we were then allowed to go to a\r\nhotel and get our breakfast, a privilege which most of us were not slow\r\nto avail ourselves of. I made a hearty meal of cold roast beef, café au\r\nlait, excellent bread, and delicious butter. The two last I have found\r\never since I have been in France. I gave my keys to the commissionaire\r\nof the hotel to get my luggage through the custom-house, and, my place\r\nbeing taken in the diligence for Paris at two o’clock, having nothing\r\nelse to do, I went to the custom-house to see the examination of the\r\nluggage. Lazy custom-house officers and gendarmes were lounging about,\r\nwhile heavy carts loaded with baggage were drawn up from the boat by\r\nwomen!--and this while it was raining hard, and the poor creatures were\r\nwithout hats or bonnets, and had only a handkerchief or a bit of cloth\r\ntied over their heads. So much for this self-styled most refined and\r\npolite nation! I noticed the poor things when their task was done and\r\nthey were waiting to convey the trunks, etc., from the custom-house to\r\nthe various hotels. Some were chatting in groups, apparently quite\r\ncontent with their lot; a few were sleeping, and many, with the\r\ncharacteristic industry of their sex, produced their knitting-work from\r\ntheir pockets and were busily employed at a more appropriate and\r\nfeminine employment. I was amused at the strictness with which three\r\nexceedingly unpleasant-looking fellows searched all our baggage, that of\r\nthe ladies not less than that of the men. Little parcels were opened,\r\ndirty linen was overhauled and most minutely inspected; the whole scene\r\nwould have made a fit subject for the pencil of Hogarth. My\r\ntraveling-bag was examined from top to bottom, and I began to fear that\r\nmy trunk, which I had packed with care, would be sadly deranged, but\r\nthey contented themselves with cutting open a packet of seeds I was\r\ntaking from the Horticultural Society to De Candolle, and with seizing\r\nas a great prize my rather formidable parcel of letters of introduction.\r\nThis was near causing me to be detained until the next diligence; but\r\nthe commissionaire succeeded in getting them sent up to the inspector in\r\nanother part of the town, upon whom we called, when after due\r\nexplanation had been made, and one or two of the letters read, they were\r\nformally delivered back to me.\r\n\r\nI can tell you what a French diligence is like. It is just like one of\r\nthe railroad cars (about three apartments) of the Harlem railroad, for\r\nexample, mounted on coach wheels; the horses are small, lean, shaggy,\r\nand ugly; some seven of these beasts are fastened, three abreast and one\r\nfor a leader, with ropes to the said diligence; but how such beasts\r\ncontrive to draw such a cumbrous vehicle, loaded with seventeen persons\r\nand their baggage, besides a driver and conductor, I don’t well\r\nunderstand, although the beasts are changed every five or six miles; but\r\nsomehow we got over the ground pretty fast, and came to Paris, over one\r\nhundred and forty miles, in a little less than thirty hours, although it\r\nrained all the first day and part of the second, and the roads were\r\nextremely muddy.\r\n\r\nWe arrived just before nightfall at Montreuil, a fine old fortified\r\nFrench town situated on the summit of a hill and overlooking a broad\r\nvalley, which in summer must be quite beautiful; here we dined, and were\r\ncharged four francs each for dinner, besides sous to the garçon. I slept\r\npretty well in the night, during which we passed Abbéville, where there\r\nis said to be a fine church. We breakfasted at the queer old town of\r\nBeauvais, where there is a fine cathedral, of which I had a pretty good\r\nview. My breakfast (déjeuner à la fourchette, which is the next thing to\r\na dinner) cost three and a half francs, for on this route you meet with\r\nvery English charges. I wished to say something about the country, but\r\nhave not room. Suffice it to say that we passed through the town of St.\r\nDenis late in the afternoon, where I did not even get a glimpse of the\r\nvery ancient cathedral, and arrived at Paris just before nightfall.\r\nAfter dinner, in company with a fellow-passenger, a young Englishman, I\r\ngratified a long-felt curiosity by strolling through the Palais Royal\r\nand some of the principal streets of Paris. On Sunday I attended church\r\nin the morning (after a vain attempt to find the American Chapel) at the\r\nRev. Mr. Sayer’s English Episcopal Chapel, where I heard a good sermon;\r\nand in the evening at the Methodist Chapel, where the Rev. Mr. Toase\r\npreached a truly excellent discourse from Jeremiah viii. 13. All the\r\nshops were open just as on any other day, and the gardens and parks were\r\nall crowded. This morning I went down to the Jardin des Plantes,\r\nstopping by the way to see the ancient church of Notre-Dame, where I\r\nheard a portion of the Catholic service chanted.... At last, after\r\nlooking at many other buildings and objects of curiosity, about which I\r\nwill tell you more presently, I reached the garden, found Decaisne, who\r\ncould speak no English, and I almost no French; so he took me to Adrien\r\nde Jussieu, who makes out to speak very tolerable English, and to\r\nunderstand me pretty well. I left soon to call on Mr. Webb,[77] who is\r\nan Englishman, for whom I had a letter from Hooker; thence after\r\nlooking in vain for “appartements garnis “ in Rue de l’Odéon, Place de\r\nl’Odéon, etc., I secured my lodgings here, where I shall be obliged to\r\nhear nothing but French, and where I hope I may catch some of the\r\nlanguage, and after dining at the ordinary at the Hôtel de Lille, where\r\nEnglish is spoken, I transferred myself to my present quarters. But my\r\nsheet is full. I will give you another very soon. Till then, mes chères\r\npetites sœurs, adieu.\r\n\r\nWednesday evening, March 20.--I must continue my letter to you on a\r\nlarge sheet of thin French paper, else I shall have a larger bill of\r\npostage to pay than will be altogether convenient when I send to Havre.\r\nI did not write last evening; I had no fire in my room, and after\r\nrunning about all day over streets paved with little square blocks of\r\nstone, which it is very fatiguing to walk over, I came home fairly\r\ntired, and went to bed soon after nine o’clock. Except calling on M.\r\nDelessert, for whom I had a letter and a small parcel from Hooker, and\r\nwhom I did not find at home, I spent the whole day in looking about the\r\ntown, seeing sights, etc. My first call was at the Louvre, a large and\r\nsplendid palace, where I spent an hour or two in the vast gallery of\r\npaintings, which fill a very large salon and a long gallery, I suppose\r\nfive hundred or six hundred feet long, connecting the Louvre with the\r\npalace of the Tuileries....\r\n\r\nTo-day I have been wholly occupied at the Jardin des Plantes.\r\nFortunately for me Jussieu speaks a little English, so I can get on with\r\nhim pretty well. But you would have been amused at the attempts which M.\r\nDecaisne and M. Gaudichaud[78] and myself made to understand each\r\nother. Still more amused would you have been to see how I managed to\r\nmake a bargain with a bookseller for a few books I wished to purchase. I\r\nfeel the want of French sadly, and have no time for study.\r\n\r\nThursday evening.--I have been again occupied the whole day at the\r\nJardin des Plantes, and went at six o’clock to dine with Mr. Webb to\r\nmeet M. Gay.[79] Webb had taken care to ask an English student also, who\r\nspeaks French much better than he does English, who sat between Gay and\r\nmyself and interpreted when it became necessary. But Gay speaks a little\r\nof what will pass for English, mixed here and there with French, so that\r\nI got on very well indeed.\r\n\r\nGaudichaud was also there, a very interesting man if one could talk with\r\nhim. We were kept rather late, so that it is now past twelve, so I must\r\nbid you good-night.\r\n\r\nMonday evening.... At three o’clock I went to the Institute. I found\r\nthat the room was already crowded. I inquired for Jussieu and\r\nBrongniart, the only members I could think of that I knew, but they were\r\nnot there and therefore I could not get in. After some time Jussieu came\r\nin. But it was then too late, so I lost the object for which I had given\r\nup half the day. Jussieu, however, took me into the library, which is\r\nworth seeing. I employed the remaining hour or so in purchasing some\r\nprints of remarkable buildings, etc., in Paris, and I was also tempted\r\nto buy a few engravings from some of the great masters. After dinner I\r\nwent to Mr. Webb’s, where I looked at plants for a few hours. He gave\r\nme also some autographs of celebrated botanists, and a few old botanical\r\nbooks....\r\n\r\nFriday evening, March 29.... The Garden of Plants was nearly on my way\r\nhome; so I stopped there, worked for an hour (till five o’clock), went\r\nhome (home, indeed!), took my dinner, found myself most thoroughly tired\r\nas well as hungry, having had no breakfast but a small roll of bread I\r\nobtained near the cemetery; had a fire kindled in my room, and commenced\r\nwriting to you. Just now the little daughter of the concierge, a little\r\ngirl of six or seven, who often waits upon me, has brought me a cup of\r\ncoffee, which I have enjoyed greatly, and now feel much restored. French\r\nchildren are all pretty and graceful, and I am making the little girl’s\r\nacquaintance as fast as I can; for it is difficult for me to understand\r\nher (it seems odd to hear such a little thing speak French), and in\r\nanswer to some of my attempts to speak French to her, she answers, “Je\r\nn’entends pas anglais, monsieur.”\r\n\r\nWhat great lies the French newspapers tell! Yesterday morning the paper\r\nI was reading at my breakfast stated that one of the gardeners who had\r\ncharge of the bears at the Jardin des Plantes descended into the\r\ninclosure for some purpose, and was seized by the bears, killed\r\nimmediately, and almost eaten up before help was obtained. So when I\r\narrived at the garden I of course spoke to Decaisne about it, who was\r\ngreatly surprised, for it seems the story was entirely a fabrication.\r\n\r\nI see I have at length filled this large sheet, so I must say adieu for\r\nthe present, but hope to-morrow evening to begin another. Ever I remain,\r\n\r\nYour attached,\r\nA. G....\r\n\r\nTO MRS. TORREY.\r\n\r\nWednesday evening.... There is little danger of my being spoiled in\r\nParis by being overpolished. In London one must take care to be always\r\ncomme il faut. There I took pains to keep myself rather spruce, which I\r\nhave continued here from the mere force of habit!!! But gentlemen in\r\nParis dress anyhow; they don’t pay half the attention to the matter it\r\nreceives in England; with the ladies it is perhaps different, but here I\r\nscarcely ever see ladies except in the streets or shops and restaurants!\r\nAt the houses of botanists I have only seen Mme. Gay, a very plain and\r\ngood-natured Swiss lady. As to parlez-vous-ing, it is not such an easy\r\nmatter, I assure you. You would laugh most heartily to see me in the\r\nbotanic gallery of the Jardin des Plantes, endeavoring to carry on a\r\nconversation with Gaudichaud or Decaisne; the former of whom can\r\nscarcely read English, and the latter can speak only a dozen words. I\r\nget out, with no little difficulty, a few sentences of such French as\r\nhas not been heard since the days of King Pepin, I am sure; and when\r\nthat fails me I write in English, which Decaisne can read, and make him\r\nwrite in French in return, or else for short sentences speak very slowly\r\nand distinctly. From my ignorance of the language I am obliged to take\r\ngreat pains when I wish to purchase anything from the shops; for it is\r\ncustomary to put on an additional price to English customers.\r\nFortunately my complexion and the style of my countenance are so far\r\nFrench that before I speak I am generally taken for a native, and I\r\nsometimes manage to make purchases without saying a word beyond a\r\nmonosyllable. So I have to be very careful to avoid being cheated; but I\r\nam every day acquiring more knowledge and experience.\r\n\r\nI have been seized with a mania for collecting prints on a small scale,\r\nand shall send home some very good ones,--to adorn my parlor and study\r\nat Michigan, of course! There are astonishing quantities to be found\r\nhere. I am endeavoring to get all the portraits of botanists I can, and\r\nfrom this I have been led to pick up ancient ones, which show the early\r\nstate of the art or old-fashioned costumes, etc., and also a few choice\r\nengravings from the old masters; but most of these I can obtain better\r\nin Italy or Germany. Tell Dr. Torrey not to be alarmed, for I shall not\r\nspend much money upon them.\r\n\r\nAs a general thing Paris is not very beautiful. But there are some\r\nmagnificent sights, I assure you. At odds and ends of time I have\r\nalready seen most of the ordinary sights which attract the attention of\r\ntravelers, but must leave all account of them for the journal from\r\nParis, which so far is addressed to the girls, though I fear it will\r\nscarcely interest them or any one else....\r\n\r\nDecaisne has given me separate copies of his papers. He is now\r\npublishing a most splendid (botanically speaking) memoir upon the order\r\nLardizabaleæ, in which I see he has found out some things which have\r\nbeen known to Brown only, for a long time. He will give us copies, I\r\ndare say. He is one of the best botanists here. I like Gaudichaud also\r\nvery much....\r\n\r\nI have just finished the examination of Michaux’s herbarium, which has\r\nproved worth looking over. I shall write the doctor more particularly,\r\nindeed have already begun a letter for him. Mr. Webb showed me last\r\nevening a letter from Hooker, which contains a good deal of botanical\r\nintelligence for himself and me. The British Antarctic expedition, he\r\nsays, is to sail positively in August, and Joseph is to go. I wonder if\r\nthey will be two years or so in getting off!...\r\n\r\nTO THE MISSES TORREY.\r\n\r\nPARIS, April 1, 1889, Monday evening.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GIRLS,--It is rather late, and I have no fire in my room, to\r\nwhich I have just now returned, but it is nearly comfortable without\r\none, and so we will have a few words together before I sleep. My last\r\nand long sheet was closed, I think, on Friday evening. On Saturday my\r\nmorning was spent as usual at the Jardin des Plantes; returning from\r\nwhence I looked along the shops and so on to the Pont du Louvre, which I\r\ncrossed; passed through the Palais Royal at the most busy season, when\r\nit is all lighted up splendidly, and dined at the Restaurant Colbert at\r\nhalf past seven. I am patiently exploring (I should say eating) my way\r\nthrough the mazes of French cookery, and am trying to select from the\r\ncomplicated bill of fare the more peculiar and national dishes, some of\r\nwhich are excellent, others so-so, or very poor....\r\n\r\nTo-day I have been again at the Garden, working as hard as possible,\r\nsince I have so little time remaining. I dined at half past six at one\r\nof the famous restaurants, just to see how it was managed, and returning\r\nspent the early part of the evening with Mr. Webb, who lives near me.\r\n\r\nOn my way from the Garden, I stopped at another church. I believe the\r\nonly remaining one of large size and much interest which I had not\r\nalready seen.... It is called St. Severin, and is very old, having been\r\nbuilt in the year 1210.\r\n\r\nThis is the first of April, and a fine spring day it has been, though\r\nthe season is little more advanced than at New York. In two weeks I must\r\nbe again upon the wing, and shall soon meet the summer. I want to see\r\nthe south of France and sunny Italy. Adieu.\r\n\r\nTuesday evening, April 2.--I intended to have had time this evening to\r\nwrite several letters, but Decaisne has been with me, and did not leave\r\nuntil almost twelve, we had so much to talk about. I have been all the\r\nmorning at the Garden; have worked very hard, indeed, and have nearly\r\nfinished there. To-morrow is like to be a broken day, as I have made an\r\nengagement to see Dr. Montagne[80] and his microscope at twelve o’clock,\r\nwhich will take an hour or two out of the very best part of the day. I\r\nwill try to turn the fragments of the day to some account. But now\r\ngood-night.\r\n\r\n    “To each, to all, a fair good-night,\r\n     And pleasing dreams, and slumbers light.”\r\n\r\nMonday evening, April 8.... Saturday was a little more diversified. I\r\nwent at eight o’clock in the morning to Professor Richard’s,[81] who\r\nlives near me, examined some plants of Michaux, then took my breakfast,\r\nwent to the Garden for three or four hours, but returned at two o’clock\r\nto see the Chamber of Peers in session, M. Gay having provided me with a\r\nticket of admittance, which procured me a very good seat. The members\r\nall wear a kind of court dress, the military peers swords, and those who\r\nhave them display the insignia of the order of the Legion of Honor, and\r\nso forth. Several new peers were admitted, but before they were\r\nintroduced, a number of peers made some remarks which could not have\r\nbeen very flattering to them, the creation of a new batch just at this\r\ntime having given much dissatisfaction to the old ones. Among others, I\r\nheard a little speech from the famous Marshal Soult. Lord Brougham, who\r\nis now in Paris, was present. I recognized him across the room by his\r\nhomely face, which he is in the habit of twitching and contorting\r\nincessantly, as if it pained him. He seemed to listen with much\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I paid a visit to Mr. Spach,[82] looked over plants and\r\nso forth until ten o’clock, returned shivering with cold, for the\r\nweather here is like March in New York. I am now sitting by a large\r\nfire, and yet I am shivering.\r\n\r\nTuesday evening, April 9.--In the morning went to hear Mirbel[83]\r\nlecture at the Sorbonne; he speaks so distinctly that I understood him\r\ntolerably well in general. The lecture-room is old and incommodious,\r\nrather better, to be sure, than the accommodation for the students of\r\nthe university in the olden time, when they used to sit upon straw\r\nspread in the streets, but certainly not very fine. I went afterward to\r\nthe Ecole de Médecine; heard the professor of anatomy for a few minutes;\r\ncame away, saw two or three books that I wanted in a stall belonging to\r\na shop, priced them; found the price much higher than I intended to\r\ngive, so I named the price I would give; was amused with the\r\nperseverance of the very genteel madame, who reduced her price down to\r\nwithin seven francs of my offer, and then labored hard to make me take\r\nthem. I advanced one franc, but utterly refused to give a sou more.\r\n“Vous n’êtes pas raisonnable,” says madame. “Je suis très raisonnable,”\r\nI replied, “mais votre prix n’est pas raisonnable.” So I left the shop,\r\nmadame very coolly replacing the books on the shelf, with one eye turned\r\ntoward me to see if I would relent. I had got some distance down the\r\nstreet when the boy came running after me, to say that I might have the\r\nbooks, “mais ils sont très bon marché.” So much for the way you are\r\nobliged to make bargains here. Went to the Garden, returned to dine\r\nhere, paid a little visit to Mr. Webb, and must write the remainder of\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\nThursday evening, April 11.--My approaching departure makes it a very\r\nbusy time for me. Let me recollect what I did yesterday. I went first to\r\nBaron Delessert’s; studied in his magnificent library until about one\r\no’clock; then visited my banker, who is near, drew some money; then to a\r\nbookseller to arrange some matters about our “Flora” (which I failed to\r\ndo); went to the Bibliothèque du Roi, where they have miles of books and\r\nacres of manuscripts, but as it was not a public day, I did not see half\r\nthat I wished. I have made arrangements, however, for a future day. I\r\nwent next to the post office, and took a place in the malle-post (which\r\nis very much quicker than the diligence) for Lyons, to go on Monday; so\r\nthat the time of my departure is pretty well fixed. I next went to learn\r\nthe time of the departure of the carriages for Sèvres and Versailles,\r\nwhich places I intend to visit to-morrow. Then I met Chevalier, the\r\noptician, by appointment, to consult about microscopes for an hour or\r\ntwo.... Called on M. Gay, with whom I found M. Boissier, a Swiss\r\nbotanist whom I had often seen at the Garden, and also August St.\r\nHilaire,[84] who returned but a few days since from Montpellier.\r\n\r\nOn reaching my room at half past ten, I found a note from Mr. Webb,\r\nsaying that M. Spach had a message for me from Mirbel, and asking me to\r\ncall if I had time; went immediately, but was too late; Webb had gone to\r\nbed. Returned, arranged accounts, etc., and went to bed myself.\r\n\r\nTo-day I have been, if possible, still more busy; at least I have\r\naccomplished more, though I made a bad beginning. The concierge promised\r\nto call me at eight, but I awoke myself at nine. Consequently it was\r\npast ten before I made my first call, which was upon Mr. Webb, to know\r\nwhen I was to see Mirbel. I called next upon Dr. Montagne to get a\r\nletter to the chief curator of the Bibliothèque du Roi, which should\r\nafford me the opportunity of seeing this, the largest library in the\r\nworld, on a private day, namely, Monday, the only public day while I\r\nstay being Friday, when I have something else to do. _Eh bien._ I went\r\nnext to the Louvre, and saw the other and best half of that most\r\nmagnificent gallery, my passport giving me a ready admittance....\r\nSuffice it to say I saw very much to admire--some things that I greatly\r\nadmired--very much I did not allow myself time enough to become\r\ninterested in, as well as many works of the old fellows that one likes\r\nto say he has seen.... Again in a cabriolet to the Ecole de Médecine;\r\nlooked through the museum, which was to-day open to the public; saw for\r\na moment the examination of a batch of candidates for a vacant\r\nprofessorship by concours; also the examination of students in the same\r\nway; then I visited the Musée Dupuytren,--a surgical museum of great\r\nextent; then went to the Ile St. Louis (opposite the Garden) to call on\r\nM. de St. Hilaire; not at home, so I saved a little time. Next to the\r\nGarden; looked on my way at the animals, the hyenas, lions, giraffe,\r\nmonkeys, etc., besides a few large snakes; then called at Mirbel’s\r\nrooms, who took a great deal of trouble to show me most curious things\r\nin vegetable anatomy, but of this I will write to your good papa, who\r\nwill care much more for it than you. After this I saw Decaisne for a few\r\nminutes at the botanical gallery; took one of the young lads with me;\r\nsaw the mineralogical cabinet and that of fossils, which occupy a new\r\nand most beautifully arranged gallery. Here I saw many of the famous\r\nthings I have heard so much of. In the vestibule to this gallery they\r\nare preparing a pedestal for a fine and large statue of Cuvier. I went\r\nnext to Jussieu’s house, talked with him for a few minutes, and bid him\r\ngood-by. On my way home stopped at Ballière’s, the bookseller, to\r\ntransact some business; home; dined at half past seven; went to Webb’s,\r\nwhere I like to go of an evening, as I get a good cup of tea (no common\r\nthing in Paris), which, after such a day’s work, was very grateful, I\r\nassure you; remained until half past nine; returned here, took up my\r\npen, and voici the result; and if I do not write plainly and neatly, it\r\nis no great wonder, and I trust you will excuse it, for I have other\r\nwriting to do also this evening. Besides, I must rise at seven, as I\r\nexpect another very busy day. On my return this evening, I found a\r\npolite note from Delessert[85] accompanying a magnificent present, no\r\nless than a copy of three volumes of the “Icones Selectæ.” An invitation\r\nfor Saturday evening from M. and Mme. Delessert came with it. I am\r\nalready engaged to dinner, at half past six, for the same day.\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning, half past seven.--[After an account of a visit to\r\nVersailles, he goes on:] Now bidding adieu to all this most interesting\r\nground, I took up my march, on foot and alone, for St. Germain, distant\r\nabout four miles. From the heights of Louveciennes I obtained the first\r\nview of the Seine and the lovely and broad valley through which it\r\nwinds. Here I passed the remains of an elevated and striking aqueduct\r\nwhich conveyed water to a royal château which formerly stood in the\r\nneighborhood, and also, I believe, to the village of Marly, through\r\nwhich I passed a little farther on. Then descending rapidly, I reached\r\nagain the banks of the Seine, the terrace of St. Germain being directly\r\nbefore me. It was now three o’clock. The steep hill was to be ascended\r\nby a winding road, and being somewhat leg-weary, I stopped a passing\r\ncountryman’s cart; the lad who was driving readily gave me a seat by his\r\nside, and thus I rode into St. Germain. The lad was quite intelligent,\r\nand answered all my questions (when he understood me) very readily. He\r\nset me down close by the château. I gave him ten sous for his trouble,\r\nand we parted on good terms with each other. The château of St. Germain,\r\nwhich was a chief royal residence before Versailles was built, is more\r\ninteresting to us as the place where the Stuarts kept their petty court\r\nso many years. It is now converted into a military penitentiary, and I\r\nwas not anxious to examine the interior, as I am informed scarce any of\r\nthe original apartments or furniture remain. The exterior is striking,\r\nquite of the old style, built of the same red bricks as the central\r\nportion of Versailles. What is most worth seeing here is the terrace, a\r\nbeautiful park, extending for almost two miles along the brow of the\r\nhigh ridge, with the most beautiful view from it of the valley beneath\r\nand before you, the hills that bound your view, and the numerous\r\nvillages scattered here and there. A finer situation cannot be imagined.\r\nThe Seine, after passing Paris, makes a bold, double turn. The view\r\nextends quite to Paris (fifteen miles) though the city is nearly\r\nconcealed from view, yet you see the grand Arc de l’Etoile distinctly.\r\nIn the summer it must be surpassingly beautiful. At four o’clock I\r\ndescended the steep declivity to the commencement of the railroad, took\r\na little refreshment; at twenty minutes past four we started in cars\r\npropelled by steam, and in an hour I was in Paris and taking my dinner\r\nat the Restaurant Colbert. A pretty good day’s work!\r\n\r\nSaturday, went to dine at Mr. Webb’s; a little party,--a bachelors’\r\nparty, for Webb is single,--consisting of Dr. Montagne, M. Berthelot, M.\r\nand Mme. Ramon de la Sagra, M. Spach and his wife, and a young Spaniard\r\nwhose name I do not recollect. Webb is quite a polyglot; he speaks\r\nFrench, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Modern Greek, and I know not what\r\nbesides his mother tongue. At half past nine I left, took a cabriolet\r\nfor Delessert’s, where I had been invited to an evening party; found\r\nthere several botanists and persons I knew. Delessert received me\r\ncordially, introduced me to Madame D., who I was rejoiced to find spoke\r\nEnglish very well. The suite of rooms thrown open was very splendid, and\r\ncommunicating with the last was a pretty greenhouse, filled with\r\nvigorous plants, all in fine bloom; the whole, carpeted and lighted,\r\npresented a most inviting appearance. The brothers Delessert are said to\r\nbe very rich, and I suppose can well afford such an expensive\r\nestablishment. The party broke up at eleven. Besides tea, which is quite\r\nEnglish, though the French are getting more into the custom of using it\r\nwe had ices, etc., but nothing else. The whole affair was conducted\r\nwithout any parade and in quiet good taste....\r\n\r\nNotabilia varia.--Ellimia, Nutt., was described a little before us by\r\ntwo authors under two different names: First by Cambessides in\r\nJacquemont’s Travels, under the name of Oligomeris; second by Webb and\r\nBerthollet, “Histoire Naturelle des Iles Canaries,” under the name of\r\nResedella; Webb has Jacquemont’s plant from the Himalaya and his own\r\ngrowing together; they are absolutely the same. I am to examine them\r\nsoon, but have scarce a doubt they are even the same species as ours.\r\nWebb has promised me a specimen. It is also the Reseda glauca of Delile\r\nex Egypto. It is curious that the plant should at the same time be\r\ndescribed from almost every part of the world, and not less so that the\r\nthree names hit upon should have all meant the same thing, namely, a\r\nreduced reseda.\r\n\r\nI have just spent the evening with Gay. He is publishing Carices in\r\n“Annales des Sciences Naturelles:” has hit upon some of Boott’s notions;\r\nbut not all. He is a laboriously minute observer, and will do pretty\r\nwell, but like Boott inclines to make too many species. He insists upon\r\ndescribing the small form of C. Hitchcockiana from Dr. Sartwell and\r\nKentucky as a distinct species, in which he may be right. He wished to\r\nname it after me, but I declined the honor, and have transferred it to\r\nDr. Sartwell, the discoverer, whose name it is to bear....\r\n\r\nDelessert received me very kindly when I called on him. I must call\r\nagain soon, and consult especially his rich library. He showed me a list\r\nhe had just ordered from New York; among which of course was our\r\n“Flora.” I should have offered him a copy, but now it is scarcely worth\r\nwhile.... I shall not see De Candolle here. Delessert does not expect\r\nhim until May. I shall leave the books and parcels for him with\r\nDelessert, and make De Candolle take back to Geneva with him all my\r\nparcels that I do not wish to take with me to the south.\r\n\r\nApril 2, evening, or rather April 3, as it is past midnight.--I have\r\nworked to-day as hard as I could jump from ten to half past five o’clock\r\nat the herbarium général of the Museum de Paris, and have finished.\r\nApart from Michaux’s plants, of which they have nearly a set\r\ndistributed, they are wretchedly poor in North American species; almost\r\nnone of Lamarck and Poiret. I except the plants given by LeConte,\r\nTorrey, etc., which are arranged but not incorporated. The present\r\nGallery of Botany is exceedingly fine and spacious, and well planned. I\r\nhave gone carefully through all Michaux’s herbarium (from your limited\r\ntime you have made some bad slips in the Carices of Michaux, which Gay,\r\nI am sorry to say, has found out), noting all dubious matters to be\r\nsettled by examination of Richard’s set. I have gone through De la\r\nPylaie’s herbarium completely and carefully; I have examined the\r\nherbarium given by Humboldt,--not complete but said to be as large as\r\nKunth’s own set or more so, and labeled by Kunth; I have looked at\r\neverything here which I thought could interest us, but some I found not,\r\nsuch as Cercocarpus; I have examined some other separate sets of the\r\nsame kind. I am now ready to glance through Jussieu’s herbarium, which\r\nis said to contain many Lamarck and Poiret; to spend a little time in\r\nRichard’s, a few hours more for Desfontaines at Webb’s, and perhaps\r\nBerlandier’s[86] plants, though these are distributed through Webb’s\r\nimmense collection; this I can do, however, in evenings. Then a morning\r\nor two at Delessert’s, which will be more occupied with examination of\r\nbooks than plants, will, I believe, finish. Webb has promised to give me\r\nsome plants of Labilliardière, whose herbarium he bought, as he did\r\nMercier’s, in which he got many of Nuttall’s plants. He has also a\r\ncollection of Lady Dalhousie’s from North America, all Drummond’s, etc.,\r\netc.; so he is pretty rich in North American plants, but they are not\r\nall arranged yet. Webb has most generously presented me with a complete\r\ncopy of L’Héritier’s Works (in sheets) except the “Cornus,” which I have\r\nthis day bought of the Jew Meilhac, and for which I was obliged to give\r\nsix francs. I shall have the whole bound in two large folio volumes:\r\n“Cornus” and “Sertum Anglicum” in one, “Stirpes Novæ” and “Geraniologia”\r\nin the other. I think thus far that the few copies of the “Flora” I have\r\ngiven away have turned to good account. I meant to go to Jussieu\r\nto-morrow, but Webb has made an appointment with me to see Dr. Montagne\r\n(muscologist, etc.) and his microscope, which is one of the latest and\r\nbest of Chevalier, and will enable me to decide if I may venture upon\r\none for Sullivant.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday Decaisne told me, almost by accident, that he was to do the\r\nAsclepiadeæ for De Candolle’s “Prodromus,” at the same time showing me a\r\npaper of his on the family that I was unacquainted with, much to his\r\nsurprise, but he at once gave me a copy. You must know, that although I\r\nknew nothing scarcely of this family when I left you, and now know\r\nlittle as to general structure, yet I pride myself a little on my\r\nresearches in extricating the synonymy of the species in London, in\r\nHerbarium Linnæus, Hort. Clift., Herbarium Gronovius, Banks, Walter and\r\nPursh, and here of Michaux. Accordingly on Monday (yesterday) Decaisne\r\nand myself had a regular examination of all the species we could find\r\nhere, and I furnished him with all my notes upon the synonymy, and left\r\nwith him those I had with me from your herbarium, to be returned to\r\nLondon in September next. Decaisne has been with me also all this\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nI find that very many of the pamphlets we have sent from time to time\r\nhave miscarried, particularly the copies of my “Ceratophyllaceæ,” sent\r\nby Castilneaux, and, what is mortifying, Guillemin and Jussieu received\r\ncopies, but Brongniart and Decaisne none. I have just sent my only\r\nremaining copy here (for you sent me none) to Brongniart,[87] with an\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThere is a second species of Podophyllum from Cashmere or Himalaya, P.\r\nEmodi, also collected by Jacquemont, from whose specimens Decaisne has\r\ngiven me a piece. What is most curious, it is sixandrous, and therefore\r\ncomes into Berberideæ except in wanting the dehiscence of the anthers by\r\nvalves (which Decaisne tells me is also the case in Nandina), and so\r\nRobert Brown’s views are confirmed. I should not wonder if the sly old\r\nchap had seen a specimen from Wallich when he appended the note to the\r\n“Congo Voyage” on Berberideæ.\r\n\r\nThursday evening, April 4.--Yesterday saw Dr. Montagne, the muscologist,\r\nand examined his microscope thoroughly, which is one of the latest and\r\nbest of Charles Chevalier’s. To-day I spent the morning at Jussieu’s,\r\nlooking up Lamarckian species, etc., in A. L. de Jussieu’s herbarium;\r\nwas very successful in Hypericum, but have no time now to give you\r\ndetails. In the afternoon Webb, by appointment, met me at the Garden,\r\nand we went to see Mirbel,--a man well worth seeing, I assure you. Webb\r\nacted as interpreter, when it was necessary, for Mirbel speaks with such\r\ndistinctness that knowing what he was about I could understand him\r\npretty well.\r\n\r\nI like Mirbel excessively. Considering I was a perfect stranger, of whom\r\nhe knew nothing, I think he took great pains to show me what I wanted to\r\nsee. Sullivant’s microscope will be of the same kind as his, only\r\nbetter, so that he will have the means of being a second Mirbel.\r\nExamined his microscope, which is a good one, but I think not equal to\r\nthe best English; got some good hints, etc.; am to call again. He is\r\nvery communicative, and you missed much in not seeing so extraordinary a\r\nman. He showed me a series of drawings and engravings on which he has\r\nbeen long engaged, for a mémoire on the structure of roots,--splendid\r\ndrawings; and he explained to me what I before could not form a clear\r\nidea about, how the curious emboîtement or thickening of the walls of\r\ncells takes place by the development of new cells within the old. He\r\nshowed me what I at once recognized as the so-called gridiron-tissue\r\nwhich I had seen in England, and I noticed that he explained it in the\r\nsame way as Brown. He promised me copies for self and friends of the\r\nlate paper of his on Embryologia in the “Comptes Rendus,” just now read\r\nbefore the Institute (which will also be published with a part of the\r\nplates in the “Annales des Sciences Naturelles” and finally completely\r\nin “Archives du Muséum “), in which he says he has completely upset the\r\nnew-fangled notions of Schleiden, Unger, etc. (adopted by Endlicher);\r\nand, what is remarkable, his investigations on the subject were made\r\nbefore he knew of their views, and the publication is only a little\r\nhastened on account of theirs. This evening I have been with Webb,\r\nlooking up Desfontaines and Poiret plants, also some of Spach. Did I\r\ntell you I have seen a good deal of Spach of late? He does not agree\r\nwell with the other botanists of the Garden; but there are some good\r\npoints about him, and he is mending every day. I pushed him rather hard\r\nupon some of his bad ways, particularly that of his changing specific\r\nnames, which he bore very well. Webb says he is now falling into an\r\nopposite extreme as to species, and will hardly admit anything to be\r\ndistinct; but Webb himself rather inclines to multiply species, I\r\nbelieve. I am to meet Spach at his place in the Garden to-morrow\r\nmorning. He is married, lately, to Miss Legendre, a relative of\r\nMirbel’s, who made his drawings in Marchantia, etc.,--indeed the best\r\nbotanical artiste in Paris. What a fine library Jussieu has! And what a\r\ncapital advantage it is to have a great botanist for one’s father! I\r\nparticularly envy Jussieu his collection of botanical pamphlets, which\r\nfill a large cabinet, all arranged in families, etc., the largest\r\ncollection of the kind in the world, Jussieu thinks. He gave me to-day a\r\nlittle print of his father taken in the year his “Genera Plantarum” was\r\npublished. He told me, what I did not know before, that Bernard de\r\nJussieu superintended the publication of Aublet’s “Plantes de la\r\nGuiane.” I could buy that work rather cheap, but think I must refrain. I\r\nbought to-day Schreber’s edition of the “Genera Plantarum,” two francs,\r\ntwo vols. in one, bound, for myself (you have it, I believe), and a\r\nsecond copy of “Linnæi Species Plantarum,” ed. 3 (which is the 2d Holm.,\r\nas you know, reprinted paginatim at Vienna). I gave five francs, and\r\nshall put it down for Sullivant, who should have it, unless indeed you\r\ndesire to keep it yourself. I have bought (ten francs) the first four\r\nvols. of “Mémoires de l’Institut,” 4to, bound, for library of Michigan.\r\nVentenat’s mémoire of Tilia is contained in one, also other botanical\r\npapers, and some good old chemical ones, etc. Webb is to put up for me a\r\nsmall parcel of Labilliardière’s New Holland plants.\r\n\r\nI have bought L’Héritier’s “Cornus,” so now I have the whole complete,\r\nand must get it all bound.\r\n\r\nP. S.--I have just discovered that the copy of L’Héritier’s is\r\nimperfect. I feel confident that Webb knows it not, and I of course\r\ncannot tell him. I shall have all bound up in one thick volume.\r\n\r\nMonday evening, April 8.--I finished early this morning, at Richard’s,\r\nthe examination of those species upon which Michaux’s herbarium is not\r\nsatisfactory. Richard boasts of his set as the authentic one (which is\r\ntrue), but it is not as complete nor as good as the other, which is\r\npartly owing to Richard having divided with Kunth when he could. Michaux\r\nmust have made a capital collection, since it has moreover supplied the\r\ngeneral herbarium with a pretty extensive set, and Desfontaines and\r\nJussieu with many; others I meet in the Ventenat herbarium (Delessert).\r\nThey say De Candolle has some of Michaux’s plants, and who besides I\r\nknow not....\r\n\r\nBut I have something better than all this to tell you. I have discovered\r\na new genus in Michaux’s herbarium--at the end, among plantæ ignotæ. It\r\nis from that great unknown region, the high mountains of North Carolina.\r\nWe have the fruit, with the persistent calyx and style, but no flowers,\r\nand a guess that I made about its affinities has been amply borne out on\r\nexamination by Decaisne and myself. It is allied to Galax, but “un\r\ntrès-distinct genus,” having axillary one-flowered scapes (the flower\r\nlarge) and a style like that of a Pyrola, long and declined. Indeed I\r\nhope it will settle the riddle about the family of Galax, and prove\r\nRichard to be right when he says Ordo Ericarcum. I claim the right of a\r\ndiscoverer to affix the name. So I say, as this is a good North American\r\ngenus and comes from near Kentucky, it shall be christened Shortia, to\r\nwhich we will stand as godfathers. So Shortia galacifolia, Torr. and\r\nGr., it shall be. I beg you to inform Dr. Short, and to say that we will\r\nlay upon him no greater penalty than this necessary thing,--that he make\r\na pilgrimage to the mountains of Carolina this coming summer and\r\nprocure the flowers. Please lay an injunction upon Nuttall, that he\r\npublish no other Shortia, and I will do the same to Hooker in a letter\r\nthat I am now writing. Indeed I think I will tell him some of its chief\r\npeculiarities, and then give him leave to publish the extract in the\r\n“Annals of Natural History” if he thinks it worth while.[88]\r\n\r\nI attended a meeting of the Institute this afternoon. An election of a\r\ncorrespondent took place, which ran very close between Charles\r\nBuonaparte and Agassiz, but the latter carried it!\r\n\r\nI must not forget to tell you about the Loganiaceous plant from Florida,\r\nfor so Decaisne, to whom I gave leave to sacrifice a flower for drawing,\r\nhas determined it to be; so Brown’s hint is confirmed. There is\r\nsomething rather queer about the style, which, as Brown’s “Prodromus” is\r\nnot before me, I cannot say is also the case in any of the subgenera or\r\ngenera he has indicated.\r\n\r\nEuploca, Decaisne says, is certainly apocyneous. Nuttall, I believe,\r\nplaces it in Boragineæ.\r\n\r\nApril 9.--I heard Mirbel lecture to-day, commencing his course at the\r\nSorbonne. He is a very good and clear lecturer, of the colloquial sort,\r\nand illustrates very well by rapid sketches on the blackboard. I believe\r\nyou did not see him. In the contour of his features and in expression he\r\nis a good deal like Dr. Peters, except that his countenance is more\r\nattenuated, his features small and very little prominent, and his\r\ncomplexion light. At the Ecole de Médecine I was not fortunate enough to\r\nhit the chemical professor. I heard a portion of a lecture in the\r\nanatomical theatre, but soon came away.\r\n\r\nI have had another fine lesson from Mirbel. He showed me all the\r\ndrawings of the paper, of which I send three copies. I quit to-day.\r\n\r\nLYONS, Wednesday evening, April 17, 1839.\r\n\r\nAt six o’clock precisely the malle-postes for every part of France began\r\nto leave, one after the other: that for Lyons came up; our baggage all\r\nin, our seats selected and arranged for us, in ten seconds we were in\r\nour places, and before the word adieu was fairly beyond my lips we were\r\noff at full speed. We took the route by Burgundy, passed Sens in the\r\nnight, breakfasted at six next morning at Auxerre, and during the day\r\nshould have passed through Autun, but I believe we did not; passed\r\nChâlons-sur-Saône at dusk, and arrived at Lyons at six precisely the\r\nnext morning,--a rather fatiguing ride, but I saved much time over the\r\ndiligence, which would have been even more fatiguing. The mail-coach\r\ntakes four passengers only, three inside and one with the conducteur; it\r\nis drawn by seven horses guided by a postillion, in boots almost as high\r\nas himself, and the horses are changed every five miles or thereabouts.\r\nThe time it took to change the horses I believe never exceeded a minute.\r\nI timed them once or twice by the watch, and we were moving again before\r\nthe expiration of the minute. The country through which we passed was\r\nmore fertile and in better cultivation than what I saw of Normandy; it\r\nwas beautiful but monotonous, except the latter part, which grew quite\r\npicturesque as we approached the Rhone and the rivers that fall into\r\nit....\r\n\r\nLyons is finely situated just above the confluence of the Saône and the\r\nRhone, occupying the space between the two rivers and also the other\r\nbank of the former. It has two beautiful and very steep hills, between\r\nwhich the Saône winds, which add much to its appearance....\r\n\r\nApril 25.--I broke off here some time ago, and left a space which I\r\nintended to fill up the first spare moment, by telling you what I saw at\r\nLyons; what kind of a town it is; how I might possibly have seen Mont\r\nBlanc from it had it not been a rainy day; how I called on Seringe,[89]\r\nsaw the little botanical garden, took notice of many little\r\ncontrivances, particularly the way he keeps the aquatic plants wet; how\r\nhe went with me to the Académie of Lyons, the branch of the University\r\nof Paris.... I could also describe the manufacture of velvet, which I\r\nalso saw, but for all these things time does not permit; a good\r\nopportunity of sending to New York occurring to-morrow morning. So I\r\nmust leave the hiatus....\r\n\r\nI was called this morning at a quarter before four; went down to the\r\nsteamboat, which was to start promptly at five, but which did not until\r\nhalf an hour later,--a narrow comfortless vessel, with no awning or\r\nprotection for the decks, in which point, and in the lack of all\r\ncomfortable arrangements, it is just like every other steamboat I have\r\nseen since I left New York, those between Liverpool and Glasgow alone\r\nexcepted. The Rhone, even at Lyons and far below, merits pretty well the\r\nepithets applied to it, where it “leaves the bosom of its nursing\r\nlake,”--“the blue rushing of the arrowy Rhone,” for it is rapid the\r\nwhole course. At Lyons it has a blue tint like that of the ocean, though\r\nnot so deep. Well, we were off at length, and aided by the current we\r\nmade very satisfactory progress. The distance by post between Lyons and\r\nAvignon is one hundred and sixty-seven miles, but including all the\r\nturnings of the river it must be much more; however, at six o’clock and\r\na quarter the spires and battlements of Avignon, lighted by the setting\r\nsun, were in sight, and a beautiful sight they were as we drew near. The\r\nwall of the city, built by Pope Innocent VI. in the twelfth century, is\r\nstill perfect, and very pretty, the architecture being what I should\r\nhave thought. Moorish (judging from pictures merely); the numerous\r\nspires of this very ecclesiastical town rising above it; the huge rocky\r\nelevation next the river,--the site of the ancient fortress, and of old\r\ntemples, churches, etc.,--and not least the ruined bridge of very\r\nancient date, that still throws its beautiful arches half across the\r\nriver, the lovely Italian landscape around, so fresh and green, the\r\ndistant mountains encircling the whole, made it altogether as delightful\r\na scene as one could wish to behold. But you must know that I am now in\r\nthe region of the olive and myrtle, and have in the short space of three\r\ndays concentrated, as it were, the pleasure we experience in watching\r\nthe gradual approach of summer. The season is said to be later than\r\nusual at Paris; it is like April in New York,--a few warm days, but the\r\nevenings all chilly and most of the days raw and unpleasant, The\r\nhorse-chestnut trees of the Tuileries were just bursting their buds; but\r\nevery hour since, and particularly to-day, I have noticed little by\r\nlittle the advance. Here nearly all the trees have assumed their\r\nfoliage,--that pure and delicate vernal foliage which we always so much\r\nadmire, but which you enjoy very much to come upon in the way I have\r\ndone, instead of waiting week after week, with every now and then a\r\nsnowstorm, just to keep winter in remembrance. But I must not forget\r\nthat I have seen snow also to-day. The summit of Mont Ventoux, which we\r\nhave had in full sight since twelve o’clock, is covered with snow, its\r\nbrilliant whiteness contrasting finely with the craggy brown mountains\r\nof lesser elevation, as with the green fields and tender foliage of the\r\nvalleys. There is nothing very grand in the scenery of the Rhone from\r\nLyons to this place. The upper portion is very much like the Hudson\r\nbetween New York and the Highlands, but I think scarcely as fine, if you\r\nmake due allowance for the effect of the old villages, etc. (not half so\r\ncomfortable as ours surely, but much better adapted to improve the\r\nbeauty of the landscape), with now and then a gray ruin, which is a vast\r\nimprovement. But from Tournon quite to Avignon, the scenery quite\r\nsurpasses the Hudson, and exhibits such variety, moreover, that you are\r\ncharmed continually: now bold and magnificent even; again, picturesque,\r\nparticularly where the basaltic rocks, for it is wholly a volcanic\r\ncountry, form parapets like the Palisades, but much more curious and\r\ndiversified, the more friable material being worn away in places,\r\nleaving columns and salient portions in all fantastic shapes. And again,\r\nespecially in the lower portion, we see the hills widely separated,\r\nleaving most beautiful broad valleys between, with high mountains for a\r\ndistant background. At St. Esprit we passed under the curious old bridge\r\nbuilt in the eleventh century, which is still in as perfect a state\r\napparently as if finished but yesterday. It is three thousand feet long,\r\nand is said to be the longest bridge in Europe; it consists of\r\ntwenty-six arches, and each abutment has also a little arch above it. We\r\npassed other very pretty or striking views of which I should like\r\nvastly to have good prints, but I do not know whether any person has of\r\nlate been illustrating the Rhone. But I must come to a close, not to\r\nfatigue you longer. I arrived at the most excellent Hôtel du Palais\r\nRoyal (recommended by Bentham) just in time for the table d’hôte at\r\nseven o’clock, and after dinner sallied out, with a guide to conduct me\r\nto see Requien,[90] to whom Bentham had given me a letter. I found him a\r\nprompt man, and in almost ten words we settled my plan for to-morrow,\r\nwhich is to start in a cabriolet for Vaucluse at five o’clock in the\r\nmorning, arrive at eight, spend two hours, breakfast, and return here by\r\none o’clock; spend the afternoon and evening in seeing the most\r\ninteresting objects in town, looking at his collections, his pictures,\r\netc., etc. What would you give to see Vaucluse? I have many doubts\r\nwhether it will equal my expectations, which are raised by the\r\ndescription; according to the account it must be very curious and\r\nstrange, apart from the associations of the place, which here pass for\r\nlittle with me, as I feel no interest at all in Petrarch or Laura,\r\nwhoever she may have been.\r\n\r\nAVIGNON, Friday evening, April 19, half past eight o’clock.\r\n\r\nI think you will scarcely call me an idle lad. It was about midnight\r\nwhen I went to bed last night; I was called this morning at half past\r\nfour; a few minutes past five I was on my way in a cabriolet for\r\nVaucluse, with a very lazy horse, so that it was nine o’clock when I\r\narrived. I visited the famous fountain, admired the rocks, etc.;\r\ncollected a few plants as a souvenir; took my breakfast, a very\r\nsubstantial one, consisting in part of delicate trout from the stream\r\nwhich issues from the fountain; left at eleven, arrived at Avignon again\r\nat half past two; saw the Requien museum of antiquities, which is rich,\r\nthe paintings, the little botanic garden; saw also Requien’s library and\r\ncollection of plants, etc; made arrangements for correspondence; climbed\r\nthe rocky hill which overlooks the town and river; enjoyed the view;\r\nvisited the cathedral (a small affair) which stands upon it; saw the old\r\npapal palace, now converted into a prison; returned to the Hôtel Palais\r\nRoyal, and a most excellent hotel it is, which I hope you will patronize\r\nthe first time you come to Avignon; dined at seven, having first secured\r\na place in the diligence for Nîmes at ten o’clock this evening, where I\r\nhope to arrive by daylight and be ready to go on the same day to\r\nMontpellier, where I prefer to pass the Sabbath. Now I think this is\r\ndoing pretty well....\r\n\r\nMONTPELLIER, Saturday evening, April 20, 1839.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o’clock I left Nîmes; rode through a highly fertile and level\r\ncountry, mostly occupied with vineyards, getting now and then a distant\r\nview of the mountains of Cevennes on the right, and soon of the Pic San\r\nLoup, by which I knew we were not very far from Montpellier. At this\r\nlast place we arrived at five o’clock precisely, and here I am quartered\r\nat the most comfortable hotel imaginable, the Hôtel du Midi. All my\r\nstopping-places being indicated to me by Bentham, I have no difficulty\r\nin choosing where to stop. Here you are not put into a little seven by\r\nnine chamber up five pairs of stairs, as is the inevitable lot of a\r\nsingle man traveling in the United States, but I have a room like a\r\nlarge parlor, airy, the two windows looking into a pretty shady garden,\r\na sofa, cushioned chairs, and every convenience you can think of. The\r\ntown itself has nothing pleasant except its situation, but there are in\r\nit two delightful spots, which I sought at once, after having taken my\r\ndinner,--the Esplanade, very near me, an elevated plateau planted with\r\ntrees, from which you have an extensive view of the country around. From\r\nthis I had my first view of the Mediterranean, distant, I suppose, about\r\neight miles! At the opposite side of the town is the Place du Peyrou,\r\none of the finest squares in the world, on a fine elevation, descending\r\nby bold terraces into the country around, the green fields coming up on\r\none side close to the parapet. The view is beautiful and very extensive,\r\nthe Mediterranean on one side, the Pic San Loup and the mountains of\r\nCevennes on the other, while toward the south, it is said, the Pyrenees\r\nmay be seen in very clear weather. From this point I discovered the\r\nBotanic Garden, the oldest in Europe and in many respects still the\r\nfinest. So I descended, sought out Delile the director, who it seems\r\nexpected me, and expressed his delight in a most exaggerated and truly\r\nFrench manner. I stayed with him until nine o’clock; returned here,\r\ncommenced this, but being fatigued soon gave it up and went to bed.\r\n\r\nMonday morning, April 22.--Nearly all of the foregoing has been written\r\nthis morning; but I cannot stay longer, as I should be stirring. There\r\nare many Protestants in Montpellier, it is said, but I fancy that they\r\nare chiefly not very pious, and as I should not understand the language\r\nwell enough to be benefited, I thought it better to spend the Sabbath by\r\nmyself. This was my first Sabbath on land in which I have not attended\r\ndivine worship conducted in the English language.\r\n\r\nTuesday morning, April 23.--As early as possible in the morning\r\nyesterday I called on Lady Bentham, the mother of my good friend who has\r\ntaken so much pains to aid me and her daughter, Madame Duchesnil; they\r\nlive quite retired, and are occupied in directing the education of the\r\nson of Madame Duchesnil, a fine lad of about thirteen.... The ladies\r\nreceived me with great cordiality. I prolonged my call to an hour, and\r\naccepted an invitation to take tea with them this evening.... I went to\r\nthe Garden, called upon M. Dunal,[91] the best botanist here, who,\r\nhaving lived single to the age of I should say fifty years, has found\r\nout that it is not good to be alone, and has just taken a wife. I did\r\nnot stay very long, as I found when I called that he was not in his\r\nstudy, but I suppose in his drawing-room, and I could not be so cruel as\r\nto keep him from the company of his beloved.\r\n\r\nI called next upon Delile,[92] but as he was not in, I spent a long time\r\nin looking over the Garden, noticing all the little details and\r\narrangements that it would be useful for me to know. On his return we\r\nspent the remainder of the afternoon in looking over his plants\r\ncollected in America. I dined with him at six o’clock, and spent nearly\r\nall the evening.... They have not water enough, however, to supply the\r\nBotanic Garden sufficiently, which has a very barren soil, and in this\r\ndry climate, where it seldom rains from this time till October, it\r\nsuffers greatly. The first view of this garden is very striking, but\r\nupon a more careful observation I see less to admire. Still I learn some\r\nthing from every garden I visit.\r\n\r\nPreviously to calling on Lady Bentham I had accepted an invitation to\r\ndine this evening with Captain Gordon, a retired officer of the British\r\narmy residing here, a friend of the Bentham family, who, hearing from\r\nLady Bentham and Delile that I was soon expected here, called par hasard\r\nat the Hôtel du Midi, to request that they would send him word when I\r\narrived. On finding me he insisted on my dining with him this evening. I\r\nhave this moment, while I was writing, received a note from Lady\r\nBentham, asking me to call on her this morning, saying she has a\r\ncollection of plants made by herself for her son George at some\r\ninteresting locality among the mountains, a set of which she is to have\r\nready for me, knowing, as she says, that George would surely offer them\r\nto me. Although I had arranged my time a little differently, of course I\r\nshall call immediately after breakfast. Lady B., who is now very aged,\r\nis evidently a very superior woman; she is a very good botanist also,\r\ntherefore, as I do not know the plants of the south of Europe very well,\r\nI am a little afraid of her.\r\n\r\nMarseilles, April 25, Thursday evening.--I broke off my narrative on\r\nTuesday morning, two days ago. I must continue my brief account, and\r\nthen close my letters to send from this port. After breakfast, Captain\r\nGordon called on me, and we went together to Lady Bentham. We found his\r\ndinner hour so late that we were obliged to give up the expectation of\r\nreturning to take tea with the ladies here. Delile joined us, and soon\r\nafter I went with him to see the museum of painting and sculpture,\r\nwhich, by a curious circumstance, is the richest in France, except that\r\nof Paris. There are not a few of originals of great masters; two or\r\nthree Raphaels; as many of Salvator Rosa, Rubens, Poussin, Carlo Dolci,\r\netc., many of which I know from engravings. We went next to the Medical\r\nSchool, which occupies the former palace of the archbishop, who was\r\nousted at the time of the revolution. This is one of the oldest medical\r\nschools, and for a long time very celebrated. It is declining now; they\r\nhave no professor of very great talent at present, except Lallemand. I\r\nwas shown the gallery of portraits of the professors from the\r\ncommencement almost, a prodigious number, and some of the old fellows\r\nvery queer to look at. I saw also the library, the collection of\r\nmanuscripts, classical, theological, a few Persian, Arabic, etc., which\r\nfell into their hands some years ago.\r\n\r\nThence we went to the Garden, looked at plants, but did not get on very\r\nmuch, Delile being fonder of telling long stories, complaining all the\r\nwhile how much he is pressed by his avocations, than of working hard. I\r\nthen arranged my baggage, took a place in the diligence for Marseilles,\r\ncalled again on Lady Bentham, to take leave; dined with Captain Gordon,\r\nreturned, and went to bed.\r\n\r\nRose on Wednesday (yesterday) morning at half past four; took diligence\r\nat five, arrived at Nîmes at half past ten; had time to take another\r\nsurvey of the Amphitheatre, the Maison Carrée, and so forth; took\r\nbreakfast at half past eleven; off again at twelve, passed in sight of\r\nBeaucaire and Tarascon; crossed the Rhone, here a large river, near its\r\nmouth at Arles, a curious old town which has nothing modern about it,\r\nand thus was again in Provence. The court of Constantine the Great was\r\nfor several years at Arles, which was celebrated for its refinement, and\r\nthe women and children are said to be still handsome and graceful.\r\nCertainly nearly all I saw, young or old, were comely, and many\r\nhandsome. They are all brunettes, and not a little sunburnt; but their\r\nblack hair, large dark eyes, and long eyelashes appear to advantage. We\r\nwere soon on the road again, traveled over an immense plain, bordered on\r\nthe north by a long ridge of mountains, composed of naked jagged\r\nrocks,--a picturesque range, in fine contrast to the fertile plain from\r\nwhich it abruptly rises. They are, I believe, the mountains of the\r\nDurance. At length the plain became as barren as the mountains; night\r\ncame on, and rather late in the evening we reached Aix, took our\r\nsupper.... I slept pretty well, and when I awoke we were in sight of the\r\ntown and bay of Marseilles, the latter superb as seen from the elevated\r\nplace of our view; but the town did not present such an imposing view as\r\nI had been taught to expect....\r\n\r\nGenoa, April 27, 1839. Saturday evening.--I have just finished my\r\nafternoon and evening stroll through this, to me, the first Italian\r\ncity: the birthplace of Columbus, the city of the Dorias, the rival and\r\neven the conqueror of that other proud republic of the Middle Ages,\r\nVenice, in remembrance of which, huge pieces of the chains which were\r\nemployed to bar the harbors of the latter city are suspended from the\r\ngates of Genoa. We arrived in the bay before twelve o’clock to-day, and\r\nduring our gradual approach to the town enjoyed the view to the full;\r\nboth the distant view and the near are very fine,--equal, I may say, to\r\nwhat I expected, which is saying a great deal. As seen from the bay it\r\ncertainly deserves the name its citizens long ago gave it,--Genoa the\r\nSuperb. You have the whole completely before you in one view, the\r\nbuildings rising one behind the other, the fortifications that overtop\r\nthe whole, with the vast mountain amphitheatre for a background.... You\r\nare not much disturbed with the rattling of carriage wheels here. With\r\nthe exception of one street, and this a new one (Strada Nuova) at least\r\nas to its present dimensions, they are barely wide enough for a\r\nwheelbarrow, and mostly too steep for a carriage, even if they were\r\nwider. The houses are very high; six, seven, or eight stories being very\r\ncommon, indeed usual, so that the streets are mere chinks or crevices. I\r\nfound the same advantage from this in Avignon and the other towns of the\r\nsouth of France, that is, the perfect protection afforded these warm\r\ndays from the heat of the sun. You are sure of shade; and the air is so\r\ndry that none of the inconvenience and unhealthiness results which would\r\nsurely be the case in other countries. I am at the Hôtel des Etrangers,\r\nnot far from the quay, and my room, five or six stories high, looks down\r\nupon the harbor and bay. It is nine o’clock in the evening. The light is\r\nburning quietly in the light-house, a tall and very slender column at\r\nthe entrance of the harbor, forming a beacon which is visible far and\r\nwide. I don’t know as I may say that\r\n\r\n    “The scene is more beautiful far to my eye\r\n     Than if day in her pride had arrayed it;”\r\n\r\nbut it is much softer. The evening gun has just been fired off from one\r\nof the batteries next the sea, the signal, I suppose, for closing the\r\nharbor, and the echo sent back by the hills on either side was\r\nprolonged and repeated fainter and fainter for nearly a minute....\r\n\r\nThe coast at Marseilles and that I saw yesterday may be described in a\r\nfew words: bare, jagged, sterile, rocky mountains; scarcely high enough\r\nto be picturesque, perfectly destitute of verdure, barely supporting\r\nhere and there a few stunted olive-trees. We passed Toulon and had a\r\ndistant view. We sailed between the mainland and the islands of Hyères,\r\nso remarkable for their fine climate and healthfulness, but they did not\r\nlook very inviting to me.\r\n\r\nWhen I rose this morning the scenery had become bolder and more\r\ninteresting. We were where the Alps first come down to the sea, and we\r\nhave since sailed along a coast so closely skirted by the Maritime Alps,\r\nthe chain which passing into Italy forms the Apeninnes, that there is\r\nscarcely room to construct a road between. The loftier peaks, the whole\r\nday, were covered with snow, in fine contrast with the gray and sterile\r\ncliffs below and the dark blue sea which seems to lave their base, for\r\nthe Mediterranean has the deep azure tint of mid-ocean quite up to the\r\nshore. There are many pretty villages also, which either seem hung on\r\nthe mountain’s side or to rise out of the water. In one place I counted\r\ntwelve in a single view, by no means a wide one. We passed Savona, the\r\ntown where the pope lived while Napoleon was master of Italy. Here the\r\nhills are more fertile, and vines, olives, and oranges are cultivated\r\nwherever room or soil enough to plant them can be found....\r\n\r\nIN THE HARBOR OF LEGHORN, Monday evening, five o’clock.\r\n\r\nI must tell you of the pretty view I had Saturday night. My room, I\r\nthink I mentioned, looked directly into the bay, and also gave me a\r\nfine view of the western part of the town, the mountains of that side of\r\nthe bay, and peeping over them, the sharp crests of the Maritime Alps,\r\nstill white with snow, and looking rather like bright clouds than a\r\nportion of terra firma.\r\n\r\nWhile I was sleeping soundly, about two o’clock in the morning the moon\r\nshone into the window directly into my face, and thinking it a pity I\r\nshould lose so fine a sight, she awoke me. She was near her full; she\r\nhung in the middle of the bay at just the proper angle that the flood of\r\ngolden light she was pouring upon the tranquil sea was reflected\r\ndirectly to my eyes. The city, too, looked beautiful indeed, and the\r\nmountains, and even the Alps, were all visible. I enjoyed it for a long\r\ntime, and went to bed again regretting that I had no one to share the\r\nscene with me.[93]\r\n\r\nThere is or was a British chapel here, belonging to the British embassy,\r\nbut I could find nothing of it, and so spent the Sabbath by myself,\r\nwhich was as well perhaps. At seven in the evening our boat left, and I\r\nwas obliged to continue my voyage. I wrapped myself in my cloak and\r\nslept soundly and quietly, and when we reached the harbor of Leghorn at\r\nfive o’clock awoke refreshed, vigorous, and in the finest spirits. I\r\nobtained a light breakfast on board; at seven o’clock was ashore; in\r\nfive minutes more was in a cabriolet and on the road to Pisa, distant\r\nfrom here fourteen Tuscan miles, which make, I should judge, about ten\r\nEnglish ones. My bargain was that I should be driven to Pisa in two\r\nhours at farthest, have two hours and a half there, and be returned\r\nagain safe and sound before two o’clock. This was easily accomplished;\r\nthe journey being made in less than two hours, I had the more time\r\nthere, quite as much, indeed, as I wished. It is a great comfort to be\r\nable to leave a place the moment you have done with it, and so avoid\r\nbeing sated with it. I had a letter and a little parcel from Mirbel to\r\ndeliver to old Savi,[94] the professor of botany in the university; so I\r\nwas dropped at the door of the university, once so famous, but now far\r\nfrom formidable. I found Savi, gave my letter, was introduced to his two\r\nsons, the one professor of natural history, the other assistant\r\nprofessor of botany, who showed me through the museum, which was\r\ninteresting, the botanic garden, which was not much; I then set out to\r\nsee the four chief lions, the Duomo or cathedral, the Baptistery, the\r\nCampanile or famous leaning tower, and the Campo Santo, which all stand\r\nnear each other and are soon dispatched. In fact they are the separate\r\nparts of a cathedral, the Campanile being, as the name denotes, the\r\nbell-tower, and the Campo Santo the burial-place....\r\n\r\nThe vine in Tuscany is not kept close to the ground as in France, but is\r\ntrained in arbors and festoons along the borders of wheat-fields, and\r\nwhen their leaves appear must add very much to the beauty of the\r\ncountry. One here could sit under the shade of his vine, which would be\r\nout of the question in France. But the boat is leaving the harbor. On\r\nthe right we can dimly discern the northern extremity of Corsica. Elba\r\nwe shall pass in the night, and sometime in the course of the morning be\r\nlanded in Civita Vecchia. I have made the acquaintance of an English\r\nclergyman of warm piety, who is in ill health, who has been obliged to\r\nreside for several years in Nice in the winter, and at Interlaken in\r\nSwitzerland in the summer, at both of which places he preaches\r\nregularly. He has traveled in Greece, Turkey, and Asia Minor, and passed\r\nmuch time with our missionaries there, of whom he speaks in the warmest\r\nterms. His name is Hartley. We shall go on in company to Rome.\r\n\r\nROME, 1st May, 1839, Wednesday evening.\r\n\r\nAnd I am indeed in Rome. This is enough to repay one for long and\r\ntedious journeys and even for transient separation from friends, and\r\nwhen I leave this place I feel as though my face was set homeward. I\r\nfeel it is something to be in Rome....\r\n\r\nI distinctly recollect the time when, a very small boy, in the course of\r\na long ride with a relative, the story of Romulus and Remus was first\r\nrelated to me, and how it struck my wondering fancy. And I recollect\r\nmost perfectly my first lesson in Virgil, and how, commencing with “Arma\r\nvirumque cano,” I slowly worked my way into the mysteries of Latin\r\nprosody and the story of the Æneid. Little did I think in those days\r\nthat I should ever stand within the “walls of lofty Rome;”\r\n\r\n            “Should tread the Appian\r\n    Or climb the Palatine, and stand within those very walls\r\n    Where Virgil read aloud his tale divine.”\r\n\r\nMy enthusiasm has risen by degrees, for I arrived here this morning,\r\nafter a delay at that most wretched of all places, Civita Vecchia, where\r\nan Austrian soldier, stationed there, told us he was sent as to a kind\r\nof earthly purgatory to do penance for his sins; after being subjected\r\nto those numberless petty exactions by which the purse of the pope is\r\nreplenished from the pockets of us poor Protestants, after tedious\r\ndelays on the road, and a most uncomfortable ride for the whole night,\r\nwhich altogether is enough to put one in a bad humor with\r\neverything,--after all this you may be sure I found myself in such a\r\nprosaic care-for-nothing mood that it was a long time before I could\r\nfeel the interest which the Eternal City is calculated to inspire. A fog\r\nin the morning prevented us from a good view on our approach; the\r\nstreets of the modern town through which we passed were mostly devoid of\r\ninterest, and we saw nothing but the dome of St. Peter’s and the Castle\r\nof St. Angelo. However, we got established at the Hôtel d’Allemagne, and\r\ntook breakfast. Mr. Hartley, being worn out by the journey, took to his\r\nroom for the day, and I was left to myself. Though perfectly ignorant of\r\nlocalities here, I was determined not to be deprived of the satisfaction\r\nof discovering the most interesting places for myself. My guide-book\r\n(Madame Starke) describes objects somewhat particularly, but gives no\r\ninformation as to where they are to be found. I hate the chatter of a\r\ncicerone, and felt confident that I should stumble upon something worth\r\nseeing. So I climbed the hill just before me by a magnificent flight of\r\nmarble steps, where the Egyptian obelisk stands which the inscription\r\nsays was found in the Circus of Sallust. I saw an imposing building at\r\nthe end of a long avenue, on the summit of a rise which I afterwards\r\nlearned was the Esquiline Hill. On reaching it and examining the\r\ninterior I found by the guide-book that it was the Basilica of Santa\r\nMaria Maggiore. These basilicas, retaining the name of ancient\r\nstructures, are a larger kind of churches, which were mostly\r\nestablished upon the foundations of ancient temples, or they were these\r\ntemples themselves turned into churches....\r\n\r\nAs I emerged from the Coliseum I stood between the Palatine and the\r\nCælian Hills, the Arch of Constantine just before me, the Arch of Titus\r\nin view on the right hand, and just beyond the Roman Forum, all crowded\r\nwith ruins; the very soil is mouldering brickwork and fragments of\r\ncolumns. Here I spent the greater part of the morning, silent and\r\nundisturbed, finding out by the description the ruins as they presented\r\nthemselves....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe journal is so long that most of the Italian, more especially the\r\nRoman, journey must be omitted. Dr. Gray, as is shown, was a busy\r\nsightseer, enjoying the historical and romantic associations with his\r\nnatural enthusiasm. Here began his great love of painting, of sculpture,\r\nand of architecture; he carried the details of churches and cathedrals\r\nin his memory remarkably, recognizing quickly a print or photograph of\r\nsomething he had seen perhaps thirty years before; he had the memory for\r\nform which helped him so much in his science. He was a good critic of\r\npainting and enjoyed extremely his favorite pictures, liking to wander\r\noff alone to enjoy them. Titian on the whole ranked highest in his\r\nestimation. He enjoyed much of the old church music, though his\r\npreference in music was for simple songs, hymns especially, and the old\r\ntunes to which words had long been wedded. There are many quotations\r\nfrom Byron and Rogers in the original journal. For Byron, with his\r\nbrilliant descriptions and versification, he always kept much feeling;\r\nand his great love of natural scenery had full play.\r\n\r\nTO MRS. TORREY.\r\n\r\nLEGHORN, May 8.\r\n\r\nWhenever I have an hour to spare I know of no pleasanter mode of\r\noccupying it than by writing to you, for to you my thoughts, whenever\r\nthey are at rest, spontaneously revert. I have yet an hour before the\r\nvetturino starts for Florence, and I may as well commence another sheet,\r\nthe first of a series which I may be unable to send you for several\r\nweeks, as I here leave the Mediterranean, loveliest of seas, and except\r\nI find an American ship on the Adriatic, which is not very probable, I\r\nmust keep them all until I reach Hamburg. I have just closed a\r\nformidable packet of journal, to be sent from here in the ship Sarah and\r\nArsilia, which is to sail for New York next week....\r\n\r\nI am very well satisfied with my visit to Rome. In the brief space of\r\ntime I spent there I saw everything I wished except the pope himself,\r\nand I believe I had a glimpse of him; one statue of Michael Angelo’s,\r\nwhich I only learned about when it was too late; the Catacombs, where\r\nthe early Christians used to conceal themselves, which are some miles\r\noff; the monument of Cecilia Metella, which is not handsome, but is\r\nimmortalized by three or four singularly sweet stanzas in “Childe\r\nHarold;” and the Basilica of St. Paul, which is some distance out of the\r\ncity, and was nearly destroyed by fire about ten years ago. This is a\r\nvery small list compared with what I have seen, so I am quite content. I\r\nwish you could see Rome; there is so much that you would enjoy in the\r\nhighest degree, and it is laying up a fund to be enjoyed afterwards as\r\nlong as you live.\r\n\r\nIt is now just sunset, and the air is remarkably balmy,--a mild\r\nsea-breeze, just enough to fan you. And let me tell you, however, as to\r\nItalian skies and sunsets that they are not a bit superior to our own.\r\nYou may enjoy from your own parlor windows finer sunsets every clear day\r\nin summer than I have yet seen in Italy; though they certainly are very\r\nnear ours. It is only to those who are accustomed to British clouds and\r\nfogs that they are remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe peripatetic grinders of music upon hand-organs so common in all our\r\ntowns are usually Italians, and I supposed that street music here was of\r\nmuch the same kind. This is a mistake. I have not seen such a thing in\r\nItaly or the south of France. You have universally the harp, commonly\r\ntwo players in concert, and very frequently a violin also for\r\naccompaniment, and the music is always creditable. At Avignon, the very\r\nland of troubadours, we were serenaded at dinner with a concert of\r\nharps, guitars, etc., but when they called for the coppers we found,\r\nshame to this degenerate age, that the troubadours were all women, and\r\nof the most unromantic appearance possible. The patois of all this part\r\nof France and of Piedmont, however, is the same as the language in which\r\nthe trouvères are written, and one who understands the patois as now\r\nspoken can read the former without difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe Italian language, is very soft and musical, far more pleasant to the\r\near than the deep nasal tones of the French.\r\n\r\nJOURNAL.\r\n\r\nFLORENCE, May 9, Thursday evening.\r\n\r\nFinding little more that I could do to-day, I then called at the\r\nresidence of Mr. Sloane, a descendant of Sir Hans Sloane of famous\r\nmemory, who resides in the Bontrouline palace, and not finding him at\r\nhome left a note of introduction written by two ladies, Mrs. Boott and\r\nMiss Boott, and also a letter intrusted to my care by Mirbel. I called\r\nalso at the Botanic Garden, but Mr. Targioni-Tozzetti[95] was not at\r\nhome, and the garden was of no great consequence. While at dinner Mr.\r\nSloane called to welcome me to Florence, and to take me out of the city\r\nto the Campagna,--lawns and beautiful pleasure-grounds and groves\r\nskirting the Arno for a mile or two, which are thrown open to the\r\npublic, forming the favorite drive or promenade. Almost the whole city\r\nwas there, and I never saw a more pleasant place. The roads were\r\nthronged with carriages, from the barouche of the grand duke to the\r\npeasant’s cart, all on terms of perfect equality. The grand duke passed\r\nus twice. He mingles much with the people, is accessible to all, and is\r\ngreatly beloved. The government, though despotic, is paternal, the\r\npeople are not burdened with taxes, and are contented and industrious.\r\nThe difference between Tuscany and the Papal States is manifest enough.\r\nBut I must hasten with my narrative. Early the next morning, Friday, I\r\ncalled on Mr. Sloane, looked at his garden, where he has many fine\r\nthings. We then crossed the Arno to the other side of the town, called\r\non Professor Amici,[96] who removed here from Modena a few years since,\r\nand has charge of the grand duke’s observatory. He was very obliging,\r\nshowed me his microscopes, which he thinks unrivaled, but I don’t, and\r\nthen the observatory, where I saw all the instruments, peeped through\r\nhis telescope, and from the top of the tower had a most beautiful\r\npanoramic view of Florence and the surrounding country. We then passed\r\nthrough the museum of natural history, which is in the same building,\r\nand is prettily arranged; saw the famous flowers and fruits done in wax,\r\nbut not the figures which represent the Plague, which were in the\r\nanatomical museum adjoining, and which I did not care to see. In the\r\ncollection were some recent models made under Amici’s superintendence to\r\nillustrate his discoveries, etc. They were wonderfully fine, and would\r\nbe useful in a class-room. Amici is a good observer with the microscope,\r\nbut his anatomical or physiological notions are in some cases very wide\r\nof the mark, and quite surprised me.\r\n\r\nOn leaving, Mr. Sloane and myself separated, he going to fulfill some\r\nengagement, and I to the Palazzo Pitti, as it is still called from the\r\nfounder, though it early passed into the hands of the Medici family, who\r\nfinished it, and now it is the ducal residence. I must tell you, by the\r\nway, that I should have seen a remarkable person in Florence, had she\r\nnot been sick. Sloane is very intimate with her and wished me to see\r\nher; she is the ex-queen of Naples, the widow of Murat and the sister of\r\nNapoleon....\r\n\r\nOn returning to the hotel, however, I learned that I could not get a\r\nplace with the courier next day, that the diligence which left at\r\nmid-day did not arrive at Bologna until Sunday afternoon, so I engaged a\r\ncabriolet, to start with me after dinner, arranged my affairs, called on\r\nMr. Sloane to bid him an unexpected adieu, dined at the table d’hôte at\r\nfive, and at dark I was climbing the outskirts of the Apennines.\r\n\r\nI would have liked to call upon our sculptor Greenough[97] to see how\r\nthe statue of Washington is coming on, but had not time.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise I was on the mountain-summits, among the clouds, which a\r\nstrong wind for a moment blew aside, and gave me some magnificent views.\r\nWe journeyed for some hours in this elevated region, but at length\r\ncrossed the Tuscan frontier and were once more in the country of his\r\nHoliness. Just as we commenced our descent, which is very abrupt, a\r\ndense fog enveloped us and it began to rain; in consequence of this I\r\nlost the view which you often have of the Adriatic and the Mediterranean\r\nat the same time, as well as the plains of the Po on the north. This was\r\nthe first rain I encountered, excepting a few drops at Rome, since I\r\nleft Lyons; so you may judge of the dryness of the climate in the south\r\nof France and Italy. It is very different, however, near the mountains.\r\nAt length, after a long and rapid descent, we arrived at the foot of the\r\nmountain, and stopped at a comfortable inn to take our dinner and\r\nbreakfast at once, it being about two o’clock. Several carriages were\r\nthere before us, and just before I left another arrived, bringing with\r\nit a most genuine Yankee, who amused me excessively. It seems that he\r\ncame out in the Great Western, a few weeks ago, had seen what he thought\r\nworth seeing in London and Paris, had been even to Naples, and was now\r\non his way from Rome to Switzerland, and expected to reach London to\r\nreturn by steamship in--I forget how many days! But the feat upon which\r\nhe prided himself above all was that he had ascended Vesuvius and come\r\nback again in--I don’t remember precisely how many minutes, but in an\r\ninconceivably short space of time, and very much quicker than had ever\r\nbeen done before! to the great wonderment of the guides, as he said, and\r\nas I do not doubt. This was his chef d’œuvre, and I assure you he felt\r\nquite proud of it. I laughed most heartily at the absurdity of the\r\nthing, until I reflected how rapidly I had been doing the sights myself,\r\nand felt I might justly come in for a share of the ridicule. In this\r\nday’s journey I think I outdid the Yankee, for, arriving at Bologna\r\nabout five o’clock, I immediately made arrangements for going on to\r\nFerrara the same night, and this accomplished, I had but two or three\r\nhours to spend at Bologna, a city famous for its university and its\r\nsausages; the former decayed almost to nothing, the latter still in\r\ngreat demand, diffusing their abominable garlic odor from every table. I\r\nvisited all the large churches, took some coffee, and before nine\r\no’clock was on my way through the vast plain watered by the Po, which,\r\nlike most large rivers, branches near its mouth into several streams.\r\nThe lad who drove me did not know the road very well, and lost his way\r\nseveral times, so that instead of arriving before daybreak it was six\r\no’clock in the morning when we entered Ferrara. Indeed he came near\r\nlosing his horse as well as the road, for while I was sleeping soundly\r\nin the carriage I was roused by a prodigious clatter, and jumping out as\r\nquick as I could, found that he had driven into a heap of rough stones\r\ndeposited to mend the road; the horse had slipped and was lying flat\r\nupon his back in the bottom of the ditch. With much ado we liberated him\r\nfrom the carriage and lifted him out of the ditch, repaired the injury\r\nto the harness as well as we could with bits of rope, and were again on\r\nour way. I have wondered since how I could ride thus through the night,\r\nwith only a boy with me, through a country which some years ago would\r\nnot have been deemed safe. But I felt not the slightest alarm, and slept\r\nas soundly as possible.\r\n\r\nFerrara is famous for possessing the tomb and chair of Ariosto, but\r\nexcept this is as uninteresting as you can imagine. It was Sunday, and I\r\nspent the day within doors as well as I could.\r\n\r\nBy making a very early ride I succeeded in reaching Padua at ten o’clock\r\nthis morning; visited the university so famed of old, the churches, the\r\nsplendid Caffè Pedrocchi, the Botanic Garden,--the most ancient in\r\nItaly, of which Alpinius, the elder and the younger, and Pontedera were\r\nthe directors. It is under the care of Visiani,[98] to whom I brought a\r\nletter from Bentham, and who politely showed me all I wished to see. The\r\nuniversity is a queer old place indeed, and the lecture-rooms the most\r\ndark, gloomy, and incommodious places you can conceive; everything is as\r\nold as the fifteenth century. I wish I could describe the anatomical\r\ntheatre, which is the most curious specimen of antiquity I have seen.\r\nThe Museum of Natural History is so-so. There is still a goodly number\r\nof students, but nothing to what there was in the olden time. The Duomo\r\nis a small affair, but the church of St. Antonio is like a mosque, the\r\nmost Saracenic building I ever saw,--with its seven or eight\r\nballoon-shaped domes of various sizes, and three or four tall and\r\nslender minarets. I am sorry I can’t get a decent print of it. The\r\ninterior is noble, and very rich in tombs and shrines and sculptures.\r\nHere are tombs of many of the old professors. The church of St.\r\nAugustine is in the same style, and not much inferior.... There is very\r\nmuch that I wish to write, but I have not the time nor the strength to\r\nwrite longer, and must sleep. To understand the full luxury of a bed you\r\nshould sleep without one, as I have done very often of late. Good-night.\r\n\r\nVENICE, on board steamboat for Triest, lying at anchor,\r\nWednesday evening, May 15, 1839.\r\n\r\nFor nearly two days I have been “a looker-on in Venice,” a strange\r\nplace, as unlike any other city of Europe as can be, unless\r\nConstantinople resemble it in some respects. It is more like some place\r\nyou visit in dreams, some creation of fancy, than a real, earthly city,\r\nif it can be called earthly which scarcely stands upon earth.\r\n\r\nWe left Padua at five o’clock in the morning, yesterday, by the\r\ndiligence, passing along the banks of a canal, bordered with numerous\r\nvillas; all of them had been fine, some very magnificent, but they are\r\nnow decaying. The clouds prevented me from obtaining a view of the\r\nRhætian Alps, which bound the view on the north, but I hope to make up\r\nfor this to-morrow, which will give me some amends for our detention\r\nhere; for you must know that the steamboat was to have left at nine\r\no’clock this evening, and I expected to have been in Triest this\r\nmorning; but the day has been stormy, and the water is a little rough,\r\nso, forsooth, the boat is to remain until morning; but as it is to start\r\nearly, I have remained on board, where I have a comfortable place to\r\nsleep, and a quiet hour to write.\r\n\r\nOh, I wish you could see Venice!--and the dear girls--whenever I see\r\nanything particularly queer, I think of them at once, and wish for them\r\nto enjoy it with me. And here everything is strange, canals for\r\nstreets, gondolas for coaches; not a horse to be seen in the city,\r\nexcept the celebrated bronze gilt steeds of St. Mark; palaces of\r\nbarbaric magnificence, splendid churches; people of all nations and\r\ntongues, Christians, Turks, and Jews. Surely there is nothing like it.\r\nThe view from Fusina, on the mainland, which was the first I obtained,\r\nwas charming....\r\n\r\nYou will wonder at the comparison, but the distant view of Venice\r\nreminded me strongly of New York, as you approach from Amboy. The\r\ngondola that brought us stopped in the Grand Canal near the Rialto, or\r\nrather the bridge of the Rialto, for the name properly belongs to the\r\nisland; and in crossing this bridge during the day, I found some of the\r\nlittle shops still occupied by money-changers, and I saw more than one\r\nhard Jewish countenance that might sit for the picture of Shylock. This\r\npart of the town is unpleasant, although the canals are lined with what\r\nwere once stately palaces, which now look as if about to sink again into\r\nthe water. While on my way to a hotel, I came abruptly upon a view that\r\nseemed like enchantment: the Piazza of St. Mark, a large quadrangle,\r\nthree sides inclosed by a magnificent range like the Palais Royal; on\r\nthe fourth, the church of St. Mark, and adjoining it the Palace of the\r\nDoges, scarcely less magnificent, and in an equally Oriental style. In\r\nfront is the Campanile, taller than that of Florence, but not handsome.\r\nAs you turn out of the quadrangle in full front of the palace, you see\r\nthe two granite columns, one of them surmounted with the winged lion;\r\nand you stand on the mole, with the most superb view of sea and city,\r\nshipping, churches and palaces, before and around you. I never expect\r\nagain to see anything like it. I have walked over this ground again;\r\nand one is never wearied with the sight.... The street musicians here\r\nare very good. A party stops at the door of the café: a man with a\r\nviolin, his wife and son each with a guitar, and they perform several\r\nairs exceedingly well, the woman sometimes accompanying with her voice.\r\nShe enters the café with the little wooden cup in her hand, and is well\r\nsatisfied with a kreutzer (about half a cent) from those who choose to\r\ngive, and a sweet “grazia” in the softest Italian expresses her thanks.\r\nThere is one café here frequented almost exclusively by Turks, who sit\r\nsmoking their large pipes with such an air of ridiculous gravity. Their\r\nturbans or the red caps they often wear, their flowing robes and their\r\nnether garments, which are something between pantaloons and petticoats,\r\nare very queer....\r\n\r\nI spare you a detailed account of my movements to-day and yesterday, of\r\nthe fine churches, enough to furnish cathedrals to half a dozen cities,\r\nof the arsenal, its ship-yard, the antique lions, the public garden, the\r\nArmenian convent, the gondolas and my rides therein. I have enjoyed it\r\ngreatly, and have laid up a stock for future enjoyment, for I shall read\r\nhereafter of Venice with greater interest. One who travels as rapidly as\r\nI do, if he would enjoy the full benefit of his journey, should know\r\nalmost everything before he leaves home. The true way for those who have\r\ntime and means sufficient is to study the history of each place on the\r\nspot with all its monuments and relics around them. So more might be\r\nlearned in one month than in a year at home. If I had what I am not\r\nlikely to have,--a family of children to bring up, money sufficient for\r\nthe purpose, and no other duties to prevent, I think I would educate\r\nthem in this peripatetic way. But now to bed.\r\n\r\nThursday evening, May 16.... We are to start at nine o’clock. The rain\r\nis over, but it is still cloudy. I have been for some days in Austrian\r\ndominions, but I wish to be in Austria itself. It cleared up a little\r\njust at sunset, and gave, me from the deck of the vessel, a most\r\nbeautiful view of the town and harbor, with hundreds of gondolas gliding\r\nswiftly through the water in every direction....\r\n\r\nTRIEST, Saturday evening, May 18, 1839.\r\n\r\nAs misfortunes never come single, I found this morning that our places\r\nwere not secured in the mail-coach for Monday. The fellow who was to\r\narrange the business found, after getting our passports in order, that\r\nthere was only one place left, and supposing that we were certainly to\r\ngo together, did not secure that. It was immediately arranged between us\r\nthat I was to have the place, but on arriving at the office I had the\r\nmortification to find it already taken. For an hour or so we made\r\nvarious plans, negotiated with a vetturino, but were stopped by the\r\ninformation we received, that they would be five days on the road to\r\nGratz, from where to Vienna it would require at least two days more by\r\nthe same kind of conveyance, or twenty-seven hours in the mail-coach if\r\nwe could get a place in it. We found that the quickest way left for us\r\nwas to take places for Tuesday by the mail, and go on Monday by a\r\nprivate conveyance to Adelsberg, as we had intended, where we shall have\r\na day longer than we desire; and these places we were fortunate enough\r\nto secure. So I cannot expect to reach Vienna before Friday morning of\r\nnext week! I had hoped to reach that place by the twentieth.\r\n\r\nIt rained hard all the morning, so that botanizing was out of the\r\nquestion. So I put my collection of yesterday in press; visited\r\nBiasoletto,[99] and after dinner met Tommasini,[100] who has given me a\r\nvery pretty collection of plants of the country....\r\n\r\nVIENNA, 24th May, Friday evening.\r\n\r\nThe great fête of the Grotto of Adelsberg, of which I wrote you, was to\r\ntake place on Monday afternoon. Mr. Philip, the painter, and myself took\r\na carriage to that place and arrived in good time, and saw this very\r\nstrange grotto with greater advantage and under more curious\r\ncircumstances, I suspect, than was ever done by an American before. I\r\nhad all the next day before me, as the coach from Triest did not arrive\r\ntill evening. My companion was taken somewhat ill and kept the house,\r\nwhile I took my portfolio and walked through the fields of this retired\r\nvalley to a bold and high mountain range, more distant than I had\r\ncalculated on; climbed the rocks with much difficulty; enjoyed a\r\ncharming prospect from the summit; filled my portfolio with plants; got\r\nback about five o’clock, regularly tired and hungry, and just had time\r\nto eat my dinner and secure my specimens before the coach came from\r\nTriest. We took our places just at dusk, Tuesday evening, and have been\r\non the road day and night, stopping just long enough to take our meals,\r\nuntil this morning; when at early daylight, just as I opened my eyes\r\nfrom such sleep as one might catch after three consecutive nights of\r\nsuch confinement, the vale of the Wien and the beautiful city of Vienna\r\nlay before me, the green fields reaching up to the very gates. It was a\r\nlovely sight. I have never seen the like. It began raining very soon,\r\nhowever, and has rained all day, so that I have seen little. Philip, who\r\nunderstands German, has been confined to his room by illness. But as\r\nsoon as I got my breakfast and was fairly fixed in my lodgings, which we\r\nfound as difficult to get as if we were at New York at this season (I am\r\nat the Gasthof zur Dreyfaltigkeit, a good and cheap house, and the head\r\nwaiter speaks French), I took a guide to direct me to the Joseph-Platz,\r\nwhere the Imperial Library and Cabinet are, to find Endlicher.[101] I\r\nfound the man in his den, and the moment I put my letters into his hand\r\nhe recognized Bentham’s writing and addressed me by name, Bentham having\r\napprised him of my intended visit. Endlicher received me very cordially,\r\nand I remained with him till two o’clock. He is extremely good-looking,\r\nand younger even in appearance than I expected, although Bentham told me\r\nhe was about his own age; he looks about thirty-three. I had the\r\npleasure to present in person the copy of the “Flora” designed for him.\r\n\r\nThe usual dinner hour here is from twelve to three. The common people\r\ndine at twelve, the gentry from two to four, the imperial family setting\r\na good example by dining between one and two. After dinner I went to the\r\npolice office to procure the necessary leave to remain here for a week\r\nor so, answered all the questions which are put in such cases to the\r\ntraveler, such as where I stopped, how long I intended to stay, what my\r\nbusiness was, produced my letter of credit, in order to show that I was\r\nnot likely to run away with unpaid bills,--to ascertain this point is\r\nsaid to be the chief object of all this inquiry. When you arrive at any\r\nhotel and remain over night, you are presented with a blank formula\r\ncomprising still more particular inquiries, which you are required to\r\nfill up, and it is sent to the police office. You give first your name,\r\nthen your country, age, religion, occupation, state whether you are\r\nmarried or not! whether you are traveling alone or in company; where you\r\ncame from last; your probable stay; whether you have letters of credit\r\nor not, with some equally particular inquiries! I went next to my\r\nbanker’s, found no letters! I drew some money, and obtained a ticket of\r\nadmission to a commercial reading-room, which is well supplied with\r\nEnglish and French newspapers. Here I stayed until sunset, reading up my\r\nEnglish news, in which I had got far behind, and which on the present\r\noccasion I found very interesting. I gleaned occasionally a little news\r\nfrom home, but vaguely. The information seemed in general satisfactory,\r\nbut one letter from home were worth it all!\r\n\r\nI have this morning changed the plants I have been drying, and have\r\ntaken care of my companion Philip, who is quite sick with the fatigue of\r\nhis journey and so forth. I have endured it very well, but must get into\r\nbed. Not having had my clothes off for three nights in succession, nor\r\nenjoyed rational sleep, I wonder much that I am not more fatigued.\r\nEndlicher asked me to go to the opera this evening, where there is some\r\nespecially fine music, as he says, but I declined, telling him that\r\nunder present circumstances I should sleep through the finest music in\r\nthe world. I suppose it would be perfectly impossible to make him\r\nunderstand how one could have any scruples against this amusement.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 25th, 1839.--I went early this morning to the Imperial\r\nCabinet; remained there until two, when the rooms are closed. After\r\ndinner I explored about the city until sunset; saw many of the public\r\nbuildings, the gardens, etc. I understand the localities of the town\r\nproper very well. The city itself is not large; the strong walls that\r\ninclose it are still kept up, and immediately outside of this there is a\r\nlarge open space, planted with trees and laid out into roads and walks.\r\nBeyond this are the faubourgs or suburbs, larger many times than the\r\ncity itself; very pleasant, but rather inconvenient to reach. Most of\r\nthe public buildings, the shops, etc., are in the city itself. I went to\r\nsee the fine old Gothic Cathedral of St. Stephen’s. It is a very old and\r\nexceedingly fine, large building, but the roof is very awkward. The\r\nspire is the finest thing I ever saw in the way of Gothic architecture.\r\nIt is four hundred and sixty-five feet high, and is the very poetry of\r\nsteeples. I intend to climb to the top presently....\r\n\r\nMonday morning, 27th May.--I find we are in a different climate from\r\nItaly. It has been cold ever since my arrival here; the first day was\r\nrainy, and yesterday it rained from morning to night, and was very cold\r\nand unpleasant; so of course I kept my room nearly all day. I had also\r\nto take care of Mr. Philip, whose indisposition has turned into\r\nintermittent fever, such as he has been subject to at Rome. It is a most\r\ndistressing thing to be sick in a strange land, and I cannot be too\r\ngrateful for the uninterrupted good health I have enjoyed ever since I\r\nleft you.\r\n\r\nI have deferred telling you anything about the Grotto of Adelsberg, on\r\naccount of the great difficulty I find in conveying any idea of it. It\r\nis without doubt the most wonderful thing of its kind in the world.\r\n\r\nAdelsberg itself is a little German village perched under a steep\r\nconical hill which is crowned with the ruins of an old castle; it is at\r\none border of a circular plain, several miles in extent, dotted here and\r\nthere with little hamlets, and surrounded with mountains, so that it is\r\nlike a large basin, and seems wholly shut out from the rest of the\r\nworld. It is so still and quiet that it would do very well for the\r\nvalley of Rasselas, but the mountains do not form precipices except on\r\none side, where they are accessible at a few points only, and there with\r\nmuch difficulty, as I had occasion to know. The streams that come down\r\nfrom the mountains unite to form a little river, perhaps nearly twice\r\nthe size of the Fishkill Creek; and this, after running about the valley\r\nseeking an outlet in vain, at length in despair, as it seems, dives into\r\nthe solid rock at the foot of hills near the village. The entrance for\r\nvisitors is a small hole above this, which opens into a long gallery,\r\nperhaps two hundred yards in extent. From this you descend into a vast\r\nhall, called the Dome, more than one hundred feet high, and three or\r\nfour hundred feet in length. As you descend you hear the roar of the\r\nwaters confined in their deep prison-house, and at the bottom you meet\r\nthe river which rushes swiftly to the distant extremity of this hall,\r\nand there sinks into the dark depths. Instead of a stupid monument and\r\ninscription by the late emperor, placed above this, it would have been\r\nmuch better taste to have placed in the stream a piece of statuary\r\nrepresenting Charon and his boat, for never was seen so perfect a\r\nbeau-ideal of the fabled river Styx. This is the last you see of the\r\nriver Poik; but the Unz, which bursts forth a large stream from the\r\nrocks at Planina, is believed to be the same. This river is crossed by a\r\nbridge. Then we went on to another hall about three quarters of a mile\r\nfrom the entrance; the ball-room, where a large gathering of peasants of\r\nthe surrounding country, in their national costume, were dancing waltzes\r\nin the bowels of the earth!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHiatus vastus.--I left this account of the Adelsberg Grotto, and my\r\njourney through Illyria and Styria, for the first convenient\r\nopportunity,--a time that never comes,--so now I must send it as it is.\r\nThe grotto is wonderful past all description, and our visit was very\r\nopportune; the whole scene not soon to be forgotten.\r\n\r\n29th May.--It rained all day yesterday, so Schönbrunn was out of the\r\nquestion, and I spent the morning again at the Cabinet of Botany; and\r\nafter dinner Philip and myself, in spite of the rain, set out to visit\r\nthe imperial picture-gallery in the Upper Belvedere Palace, which is\r\nfinely situated in one of the suburbs. The gallery is very extensive and\r\nexcellent, especially in the Dutch school, and we had barely time to\r\nfinish our hasty reconnoissance before it closed for the night. I had a\r\nfine view of the city from the windows of the upper story. We stopped at\r\na café on our way home, took some lemonade and ice-cream, while I read\r\n“Galignani’s Messenger” for English news. This morning I went to the\r\ngallery as usual, and after working for a little time, Mr.\r\nPutterlich,[102] the sub-assistant, went with me to the famous\r\nMineralogical Cabinet, the finest in the world. A most splendid affair\r\nit is. It occupies a suite of quite ordinary rooms, but is excellently\r\narranged and shows to great advantage. Here are all the fine gems,\r\ndiamonds, emeralds, topaz, and all sorts of precious stones, both\r\npolished and natural. I saw also the bouquet of precious stones made for\r\nMaria Theresa, a most brilliant affair. The collection of aerolites is\r\nunique. I intend to visit it again on Saturday. I obtained some useful\r\ninformation here as to the mode of constructing the shelves, etc., in a\r\nmineralogical cabinet; their plan here is the best I have seen. If I\r\nknew what I now do, I could have given a plan for the construction of\r\nthe cabinets at the Lyceum infinitely better than the present. Returning\r\nto the Botanical Gallery I occupied myself in selecting specimens for\r\nmyself from Rugel’s New Holland collections. Endlicher offers me these\r\nand other plants, as many as I like. He also offered to send to Hamburg\r\nfor me a copy of the “Iconographia Generum Plantarum,” the “Annals of\r\nthe Vienna Museum,” and some other of his works. After dinner, finding\r\nnothing else to do for a few moments, I went into a bookseller’s,--the\r\npublisher of Endlicher’s “Genera Plantarum,”--to look up some reports on\r\neducation, etc. I asked also for botanical works; and after offering me\r\nseveral things which I did not want, they brought out, as a great\r\nrarity, our own “Flora,” which I told them I did not want at all. At six\r\no’clock, Endlicher called upon me to take me to the Botanic Garden of\r\nthe university, under the care of Baron Jacquin, who is professor, at\r\nthe same time, of both botany and chemistry in the university, and\r\nscarcely lectures on either. He introduced me to the old fellow, a\r\nhard-featured chap, who managed to speak a little English and talked to\r\nme of the year he spent at Sir Joseph Banks’ in bygone times. We went\r\nthrough the garden, which is finely situated, covers much ground, and\r\nhas fine trees, but is wretchedly cared for; in fact it is almost left\r\nto run wild, although well endowed.... I have some curious anecdotes to\r\ngive you about the censorship of the press at Vienna, but have not\r\nenergy enough left to write this evening.\r\n\r\nThursday evening.--Nothing can be printed and published here, without\r\nfirst being examined and approved by a censor of the press. The\r\ngovernment appoints four or five persons in Vienna, who examine in\r\ndifferent departments, one for newspapers, one for works of science!\r\nothers for different branches of literature. Every author must send his\r\nmanuscript to the police-office, whence it is handed over to the proper\r\ncensor, who certifies that it contains nothing immoral, nothing against\r\nthe government, and that it is good literature, or science, or poetry,\r\nas the case may be, and worthy of being published; it is then returned\r\nto the author, with permission to print it. The author’s annoyance does\r\nnot end here. He is obliged to leave a copy of his manuscript with the\r\npolice, and a copy of the work as soon as printed, so that they may be\r\ncompared, and any alterations or additions detected. If he desires to\r\nmake any alterations in his manuscript after it has passed the\r\ncensorship, he must send it back for a second examination. Persons\r\nholding responsible official situations are not exempt: if a censor\r\nhimself wishes to publish anything, his manuscript must be given to the\r\npolice that it may be examined by some other censor. All kinds of\r\nworks, books of dry science not excepted, are subject to the\r\ncensorship. To my great surprise, Endlicher, who gave me all this\r\ninformation, informed me that all the manuscript of his “Genera\r\nPlantarum” is sent to the police, who transmit it to Baron Jacquin, the\r\ncensor for natural history, etc., and who is well paid for the business,\r\nbut who knows just as much about it as if it were written in Arabic, and\r\nwho certifies to each portion that it contains nothing hurtful to the\r\npeople, nothing offensive to the emperor, to religion, etc., and more\r\nthan all, that it is good science! To avoid the annoyance of sending it\r\nback repeatedly, as he has alterations to make, he is obliged to promise\r\nthe printer to indemnify him, in case any discrepancy is observed\r\nbetween the manuscript and the printed work. Endlicher spoke of all this\r\nin terms which there is no necessity for me to record just at present.\r\nHe gave me an anecdote respecting the publication of his earliest\r\nbotanical work of any consequence, a Flora of his native town, the\r\n“Flora Posoniensis:” the manuscript being duly sent to Jacquin, that\r\nworthy refused to give it his imprimatur, because, it was arranged\r\naccording to the natural system! which Jacquin did not like; and\r\nEndlicher was obliged to apply personally to the ministers and take\r\ngreat pains, when he obtained permission to print in spite of the\r\ncensor; he took his revenge by dedicating the work to Baron Jacquin\r\nhimself! This system sufficiently explains the low state of literature\r\nin Austria, as compared with northern Germany. I could hardly believe\r\nall I have heard, had I not obtained my information from such authentic\r\nsources....\r\n\r\nFriday evening, 31st May, 1839.--The remainder of the morning was\r\ndevoted to the botanical cabinet; and in the afternoon and early part\r\nof the evening I called with Endlicher upon Mr. Fenzl,[103] the\r\naide-naturaliste in the botanical department, who is confined to his bed\r\nby some affection of one of his legs. He is engaged in a monograph of\r\nAlsineæ, which I think will be very faithfully done, and we looked over\r\nseveral collections by his bedside. I made a bundle of all I wished to\r\nexamine, which are sent to my lodgings for the purpose, and which will\r\ngive me occupation for the evening. He introduced me to his frau, a\r\nregular German lassie, and we managed to converse altogether for some\r\ntime in a curious mixture of French, German, and English.\r\n\r\nON THE DANUBE, on board the Dampschiff\r\n(steamboat) Maria-Anna, bound for Linz, 5th June.\r\n\r\nSchönbrunn, the Versailles of Austria, is much like Versailles itself on\r\na smaller scale, but much less magnificent. I visited the grounds with\r\nEndlicher, and also visited the botanic garden attached, under the care\r\nof M. Schott.[104] The garden is very finely arranged, but all that is\r\nparticularly worth seeing is the conservatories and the large collection\r\nof exotics, many of them very old like those of Kew. It is richer than\r\nKew in Palms, Aroideæ, etc., but in other things it seems not quite\r\nequal. As we passed by the palace, the emperor was pointed out to me,\r\nthrough the open windows of his cabinet. I am told privately that he is\r\nscarcely compos mentis, and that all government affairs are managed by a\r\nregency of which Metternich and Archduke Charles are chief. We went next\r\nto see Baron Hügel, and the extensive collection of living plants he\r\nhas collected during his travels. I think I have not told you the cause\r\nof his long journeying. He was, it appears, the accepted lover of an\r\naccomplished and beautiful lady of very good family here, and their\r\nunion was considered as a settled affair. But unfortunately for poor\r\nHügel, Prince Metternich looked upon the lady and determined to have\r\nher. So he sent Hügel upon some humbugging political mission, to Paris I\r\nbelieve, and during his absence he made his propositions to the father\r\nand mother, who were not slow in discovering that Metternich, with all\r\nhis riches and power, malgré his sixty-odd years, was the fittest\r\nbridegroom; and I am sorry to add that they persuaded the daughter to\r\nthe same opinion, though she could have had little liking to the old\r\nfellow personally, and was said to be much attached to Hügel. The latter\r\nat length found out why he was sent to Paris, and came back with all\r\nspeed, but he was too late. His intended became Princess Metternich, and\r\nHügel set out to cure his disappointment or forget his love by traveling\r\nin foreign lands. Metternich, being glad to get rid of him, threw\r\nfacilities in his way, and being fond of plants he collected and sent\r\nhome an immense quantity for his garden. At the same time he made\r\nextensive collections of dried specimens, etc., which all reached Vienna\r\nsafely. He spent nearly all his fortune in traveling, and would have\r\nbeen in a quandary, but the government, that is to say, Metternich,\r\nbought all his collections of dried plants, animals, etc., for the\r\nImperial Cabinet, giving for them an immense price, some thirty times\r\nmore than they are worth, and so Hügel is able to enlarge and embellish\r\nhis place, improve his garden, and build most beautiful greenhouses. He\r\nhas fitted up his house very tastefully, and filled it with all manner\r\nof strange things, arms, idols, and so forth. His collection of living\r\nplants is larger than that of Schönbrunn, though the trees are younger.\r\n\r\nSeveral days after my arrival I called to pay my respects to our\r\nminister here, Mr. Muhlenberg, and the secretary of legation, Mr. Clay.\r\nPhilip and myself also spent an evening at Mr. Clay’s, where we met Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Muhlenberg, and their daughter, a young lady of about\r\nseventeen; also Mrs. Clay, a pretty woman, and Mr. Schwartz (the\r\nAmerican consul here) and his wife, who both speak English indifferently\r\nwell. Muhlenberg seems quite sick of living here, and speaks of the\r\nAustrians with anything but praise.\r\n\r\nWe went one evening to a public garden, of which there are many here, to\r\nhear the most celebrated musician here, Mr. Strauss. A few kreutzers are\r\ncharged for admission, and the company are nearly all seated, at little\r\ntables, eating a substantial supper, or sipping coffee or ices, as they\r\nincline, while Strauss with his fine band played the finest music,\r\nmostly pieces of his own composition. It was the best music I ever\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nPhilip left me on Monday evening and went to Prague. On Tuesday I\r\narranged passport, left parcels to be sent to Hamburg, took leave; came\r\nout to Nussdorf after dinner, from which the steamboat leaves, and after\r\nseeing my luggage deposited safely on board, I climbed the Leopoldsberg,\r\na steep mountain between eight hundred and nine hundred feet high, and\r\nenjoyed the beautiful and extensive view from its summit,--a fine view\r\nof Vienna, of the Danube branching into many different streams, forming\r\npretty green islands, and the whole of the broad valley far into\r\nHungary. In a fine day, it is said the towers of Pressburg, forty miles\r\noff, may be distinguished. The Danube, which is here as large as the\r\nNiagara, broad and swift, washes the base of the mountains, and the view\r\nup the river, though not so extensive, is more picturesque. I collected\r\na handful of plants, bid good-by to Vienna, and descended, slept on\r\nshore, and was on board the boat in time to start with it at five\r\no’clock this morning.\r\n\r\nThis is the first time I have slept in a genuine German bed,--a\r\nfeather-bed beneath, and an eider-down bed the only cover. It is\r\ninclosed in a sheet like a pillow-case, and under this you creep. In the\r\nwinter it might do very well, but at this time of the year it is very\r\noppressive. The upper sheet here I find, in all cases, is tied fast to\r\nthe coverlet, which is all of one piece, and just long enough to cover a\r\nmoderately sized man like myself from the chin to the toes. A taller\r\nperson must choose between his shoulders and his toes, for they cannot\r\nboth be covered.\r\n\r\nLiving is dear in Vienna. I stopped at a cheap hotel, being aware of\r\nthis, and lived as economically as I well could, but I find I have made\r\nway with a very considerable sum. The only way to travel cheaply\r\nanywhere on the Continent is not to be in a hurry, and to understand the\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nNotabilia for Dr. T.--I have seen Corda[105] at Vienna. He is one of the\r\ncurators of the collection at Prague, and was at Vienna on a visit.\r\nLearning that I was there, he called and left his card. I afterwards\r\nsaw him at his hotel. He is a little fellow about thirty, with a small\r\nexpressive countenance. He works chiefly at minute fungi, on which he is\r\npublishing a large work. I saw a part of it in London. He showed me an\r\nimmense quantity of drawings, which he makes with great rapidity. He is\r\nalso publishing a work supplementary to Sternberg’s “Flora of the Former\r\nWorld,” a work of which Corda did a good part. He gave me two copies of\r\na lithograph of Count Sternberg,--now dead, as you know,--done by\r\nhimself. I observe by his drawings that he has anticipated an\r\nunpublished discovery of Valentine’s, which he showed to Lindley and\r\nmyself in London, about the holes in the tissue of Sphagnum opening\r\nexteriorly. I looked at Corda’s microscope (one of Shiek [?] at Berlin),\r\nbut it is inferior to the English or Chevalier’s.\r\n\r\nI made a second visit to Fenzl, as he lay in bed; had a long botanical\r\ntalk with him, and think him a most promising botanist.\r\n\r\nUngnadia (the character of which Endlicher has not yet published,--the\r\nlast plate in the “Atakta”) was named in memory of Baron Ungnade, once\r\nan ambassador from Austria to Constantinople or Persia, I forget which,\r\nand the first to introduce Æsculus Hippocastanum into Europe,--hence the\r\npropriety of the name. Endlicher is soon to publish the description in\r\nthe “Annals of the Vienna Museum,” which work, with the “Iconographia\r\nGenerum Plantarum,” he has promised to send to Hamburg for me, along\r\nwith the parcels of plants given me. We have studied the new\r\nLoganiaccous plant from Florida. It proves, as Brown guessed, near his\r\nLogania § (or Gen.) Stomandra, but extremely distinct from that or any\r\nother genus, by the character of the style which Decaisne first\r\nnoticed. Endlicher is to give a figure in “Iconographia Generum\r\nPlantarum,” and the description has gone to the printer in one of\r\nEndlicher’s articles in the “Annals of the Vienna Museum,”--Cœlostylis\r\nLoganioides, Torr. & Gr. Can’t we get more of it? Has Leavenworth found\r\nit?\r\n\r\nI have been looking over the “Reliquiæ Hænkeanæ,” and examining what\r\nspecimens of the collection from North America they have in the Vienna\r\nHerbarium. Endlicher goes this week to Carlsbad to recruit his health,\r\nstopping a day at Prague. He has kindly taken a list of my desiderata of\r\nthe species published in that work, and I hope to get some bits of them.\r\nI have copied so much from the work that we can get along even if I do\r\nnot see it again, but as I was about to purchase it, Endlicher suggested\r\nthat he should see if Presl himself has not a copy left for us.\r\nFollowing this hint I have sent by Endlicher a copy of the “Flora” to\r\nPresl,[106] in nomine auctorum.\r\n\r\nThere is a new genus of Presl in Loaseæ (Acrolasia) from Mexico, which\r\nmay be Nuttall’s. The most curious thing is a new genus of Datisceae\r\nfrom Monterey (why have none of the other collectors found it?), called\r\nTricerastes; very interesting.\r\n\r\nI find from all inquiries that it is very difficult to find Nees von\r\nEsenbeck[107] at Breslau, especially in the summer. He is a queer stick\r\naltogether, is not well satisfied with his situation at Breslau, and\r\nspends the greater part of his time at a little place high up in the\r\nRiesengebirge, studying Hepaticæ.\r\n\r\nI have bought Grisebach’s new “Genera et Species Gentianearum,” and have\r\nbeen studying it on my way in the steamboat. It seems very well done,\r\nparticularly his preliminary matter on structure, affinities,\r\ndevelopment, geographical distribution, etc., which is very interesting.\r\nIt is very carelessly printed. Our well-known “Tuckerton,” in the\r\npine-barrens, figures under the form of “Juckerten”! Let this suffice at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nSALZBURG, June 10.\r\n\r\nArrived at Linz Friday noon, dined, looked a little about the town,\r\nwhich is remarkable for nothing except its agreeable situation on the\r\nDanube, and its unusual kind of fortification; and at half past one\r\nstarted for Gmünden, about thirty-five miles by railroad, in a car drawn\r\nby horses. This railroad, the oldest in Germany, is rather a primitive\r\naffair; we were jolted more than on the ordinary roads, which I have\r\nfound everywhere excellent. The first part of the road was very\r\nuninteresting. I was seated in the middle of the car, with five or six\r\ninveterate German smokers around me, each equipped with a huge\r\nmeerschaum pipe with a wooden stem nearly as long as your arm, which he\r\nreplenished as often as it was exhausted, and all puffed away in concert\r\nas if they were locomotive engines and our progress depended upon their\r\nexertions. You are everywhere annoyed in the same way, but I have become\r\naccustomed to it so that it does not trouble me as at first. At length a\r\nfat military officer next me smoked himself to sleep; and I was amusing\r\nmyself with the ridiculous pendulum-like motions he was making, his pipe\r\nstill grasped by his mouth at one end and by his hand at the other, when\r\nhe knocked his head against the window and pitched his hat into the\r\nroad, to his great astonishment and our infinite amusement. We passed\r\nthrough Wels, and afterwards Lambach, a pretty place and most\r\nbeautifully situated upon the Traun. In this part of the journey we had\r\na fine view of the Salzburg Alps, which rise to their greatest height\r\njust where Austria proper and the provinces of Styria and Salzburg meet.\r\nFrom Lambach to the end of the journey, the country appeared completely\r\nAmerican: finely wooded with fir and larch with here and there a clump\r\nof beech. We reached Gmünden just at twilight, a neat village on the\r\nvery bank of the Gmündensee or Traunsee, for it is called by both names.\r\nThe situation, close down upon the water and in the bosom of green\r\nundulating hills, is as lovely as can be conceived, and is in fine\r\ncontrast with the upper extremity of the little lake, where the dark and\r\nlofty mountains rise abruptly from the very edge of the water, not\r\nleaving room enough even for a footpath. Their summits were still\r\ncovered with patches of snow, but they are overtopped by the peaks of\r\nthe Dachstein and other portions of these Alps which are crowned with\r\nperpetual snow. I found at the Goldenes Schiff neat rooms, and a most\r\ncomfortable bed, which I was prepared fully to enjoy, having first made\r\na supper on nice trout from the lake, with a few etceteras. At seven\r\no’clock the next morning I was on board the little steamboat,--commanded\r\nby an Englishman, as most boats are in Austria,--which affords the only\r\nmeans of communication with the country beyond. The morning was\r\npleasant, and I had a good opportunity of seeing the finest scenery I\r\never beheld; indeed I do not expect ever to see it surpassed. As we left\r\nthe green slopes at Gmünden behind us, the mountains which inclose the\r\nupper portion of the lake gradually disclosed themselves more\r\ndistinctly; halfway up, we were opposite the gigantic Traunstein, whose\r\nnaked and weather-beaten summit had been full in view almost ever since\r\nwe left Linz the day before. It is a huge mountain, appearing as if\r\nsplit from top to bottom and turned with the cloven side toward the\r\nlake, so that it presents a perpendicular wall of jagged rock nearly\r\nthree thousand feet high! leaving just room sufficient between it and\r\nthe water for one or two fishermen’s huts, which look the veriest\r\npygmies. The mountains beyond this on the same side are equally\r\npicturesque, but not so high. They rise in sharp isolated peaks, leaving\r\nthe wildest glens between, down which streams fed by the snows of the\r\nmountains in the background come leaping to the lake. On a promontory\r\nwhich seems from the lower part of the lake to form its southern\r\nextremity stands the little hamlet of Traunkirchen; the picturesque\r\nlittle church was founded by the Jesuits, who once had a small\r\nestablishment here; a little nook is occupied with the wee bits of\r\ncabins belonging to the peasantry employed in the salt-works or in\r\nrowing the salt-barges down the lake; they are set down here and there,\r\nas room can be found, and add much to the beauty of the view. As the\r\nboat doubles this promontory, Gmünden and all the lower part of the lake\r\nis lost sight of, and you seem to be on another smaller but wilder lake,\r\nentirely shut in by the precipitous mountains; a few minutes more and we\r\nare landed at Ebensee, the little salt-village at the head, where the\r\nTraun enters, and you regret that the voyage is so short. I was strongly\r\ninclined to go back again with the boat, and return again in the\r\nafternoon; but knowing I had no time to lose, and that I might not\r\nreadily find another convenient opportunity of going on to Ischl, I was\r\nobliged to bid farewell to Gmündensee. Loveliest, wildest of lakes, I\r\nshall not soon forget thee.\r\n\r\nI had not time at Ebensee to look at the works where the brine is\r\nevaporated, which seem to be on a large scale. The brine is brought here\r\nin aqueducts, some fifteen or twenty-four miles, since fuel is more\r\nplenty here, and it is found more economical to bring the brine to the\r\nfuel than the fuel to the brine. The stellwagen was ready, and I took my\r\nseat. A ride of ten or eleven miles up the valley of the Traun, a narrow\r\ndefile bordered by lofty mountains, brought us before noon to Ischl. It\r\nis a pretty village, lying in a green valley formed by the junction of\r\nthe little river Ischl with the Traun; it contains extensive salt-works\r\nand is a favorite bathing-place, people of all degrees coming here in\r\nthe summer to pickle themselves in the salt water. Three immense ridges\r\nof mountains come down almost into the village, leaving a triangular\r\nspace for the village, with just three ways of getting in or out, viz.,\r\nby ascending the river as we came, or by either the Ischl or the Traun\r\nas they enter the valley.\r\n\r\nI took a hasty dinner, and left the hotel at one o’clock, determined to\r\nenjoy the satisfaction of climbing a real mountain. The Zeimitz, the\r\nhighest in the neighborhood, is said to command the finest prospect, and\r\nit looked as if I could ascend it in an hour or two with the greatest\r\nease, although the guide-book says that ten to twelve hours are\r\nnecessary for going and returning. I have accomplished the task; I\r\nclimbed the mountain, 5000 feet high, traveled over the snow from one to\r\nthe other of its four peaks at considerable distance from each other;\r\nenjoyed the most magnificent prospect; filled my portfolio with alpine\r\nplants, descended the steepest side, picking my difficult way down the\r\nrocks and sliding down immense snowbanks, until I was past the alpine\r\nportion; then making a turn to a subalpine pasture, where cows and goats\r\nare driven to pass the summer, I struck an old path, and ran with all\r\nspeed to the gorge at the base, where the stream that I had traced from\r\nits source as it trickled from a snowbank, and down a succession of\r\nlittle cataracts, was now a foaming and rushing torrent. It was then\r\njust twilight, and a quiet walk of an hour brought me back to the hotel\r\nat nine o’clock, quite proud of my feat and delighted with the fine view\r\nI had obtained. But I have paid well for it. In the morning I could\r\nscarcely stir for the aches and pains in my bones, and even now the\r\nextensor muscles of my legs are sore to the touch and bear woeful\r\ntestimony to the hard service they have been obliged to perform. “I\r\nshall think about it,” as Mr. Davis says, before I ascend another\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nAnd yet I feel myself well repaid for all my fatigue. To say nothing of\r\nthe prospect opening out wider and grander as I ascended, I had from the\r\nsummit a magnificent mountain panorama which it was well worth the labor\r\nto see; the summits of more than one peak white and brilliant with\r\nperpetual snow and ice. The most stupendous of all is the Thorstein or\r\nDachstein, which closes the view to the south, with its immense glaciers\r\nof the most dazzling whiteness, from which numerous steep pinnacles rise\r\nlike spires, towering high above all surrounding objects, illuminated by\r\nthe rays of the setting sun long after all other objects are left in the\r\nshade. The dark lake of Hallstadt was distinctly seen, appearing to\r\nreach up to its very base. I could not distinguish the village which is\r\nhidden under the cliffs at that end of the lake, where from November to\r\nFebruary the inhabitants do not see the sun, they are so shut in by high\r\nmountains. Four other lakes were in full view, two of them lying almost\r\nbeneath my feet.\r\n\r\nAnd then imagine my pleasure at collecting alpine plants for the first\r\ntime, some of them in full blossom under the very edge of a snowbank. I\r\nfilled my portfolio with Soldanella, Rhododendron, Primula Auricula,\r\nRanunculus Thora, and another with white flowers, etc., etc. I am sorry\r\nto say that in my eagerness I have left my knife, last relic of the\r\nExpedition, and so long my trusty companion, somewhere on the top of the\r\nmountain. Sunday was at least a day of bodily rest, for I did not rise\r\nuntil past ten o’clock, and hobbled out but once beyond the limits of my\r\nhotel. I was obliged to leave, however, late in the evening, about half\r\npast ten, when the eilwagen, which comes but twice a week, arrived from\r\nGratz on its way to Salzburg; and here I found myself at six o’clock\r\nthis morning; a rainy day, and a very dull town, with nothing but its\r\nfortress and its exceedingly beautiful and romantic situation to make it\r\ninteresting. There are many objects of great interest in the\r\nneighborhood, but this rainy day prevents any distant excursion; my\r\nplace is taken for Munich for to-morrow morning, and not even the\r\ninducements of “the most beautiful region in all Germany,” as it is\r\ncalled, not even the sublimities of the Berchtesgaden and the Königsee,\r\nwhich are but fifteen miles off, shall detain me longer. I begin to look\r\nwith expectation toward the end of my journey, and have already in my\r\nplans shortened it a little. I have looked about the old churches and\r\nbuildings of this town, and am waiting now for it to clear up that I\r\nmay climb the Mönchsberg, and enjoy the prospect that is said to be so\r\nfine. At midday I had hopes of a pleasant afternoon, but it is now\r\nraining harder than ever.\r\n\r\nIn this region, as in the retired parts of Styria, through which I\r\npassed to Vienna, you are charmed with the kind-hearted simplicity of\r\nthe people. If you meet them in walking, they always give you some word\r\nof greeting, and commonly take off their hats and bow to you; yet there\r\nseems to be nothing servile or cringing in it. You get a porter to carry\r\nyour baggage, who, instead of asking for more when you have given him\r\nalready more than he expected to receive, takes off his hat, makes you a\r\nlow bow, and thanks you most heartily, though without any palaver. So\r\nwith the servants, who never ask anything, and I suppose would not if\r\nyou were to forget them altogether; I doubt if they would ever remind\r\nyou; you give them about a third part of what an English servant would\r\nexpect, and you have them all most heartily wishing you bon voyage or\r\nglückliche reise, according to the language they speak. In some places\r\nthey say the chambermaid kisses your hand, but this has not happened to\r\nme yet. The women, when not rendered wholly masculine in appearance by\r\nperforming the labor of men, which is very common, are almost\r\nuniversally good-looking, and in such vigorous health. I do not admire\r\ntheir head-dress, which is ordinarily a black silk thing tied closely\r\naround the head and tied in rather fantastic bows behind. The women of\r\nLinz and all this part of the Danube wear, when in full dress, a cap of\r\ntinsel or gold lace, shaped exactly like the Roman helmet, which fits\r\nclose to the top of the head. But fashions never leave this world; when\r\nyou ladies throw aside some mode, it is picked up and perpetuated in\r\nsome out-of-the-way part of the world. Thus, for example, all the young\r\nfraus of Ischl wear balloon sleeves, after the most approved fashion\r\nsome three or four years ago. I assure you it looked quite natural to\r\nsee them again, even upon the buxom damsels of the Salzkammergut\r\n(there’s a name for you).\r\n\r\nIt is now half past seven; and it is still raining most obstinately, so\r\nascending the Mönchsberg is not to be thought of; and I must make up my\r\nmind to leave Salzburg without this view. My trunk is sent to the office\r\nof the brief-post-eilwagen, all ready for starting at six o’clock in the\r\nmorning, and to-morrow evening at eleven I hope (D. V.) to be in Munich,\r\nseventy-eight miles. I owe Bentham a letter, and have not written him or\r\nany one else since I left Paris. I will take this convenient opportunity\r\nand write forthwith.\r\n\r\nMUNICH, 12th June.\r\n\r\nI arrived in this capital of Bavaria last evening at eleven o’clock,\r\nafter a tedious, though not uninteresting ride of seventeen hours. The\r\nday proved a fine one, and after leaving Salzburg through the curious\r\ntunnel that penetrates the Mönchsberg we came abruptly into the open\r\ncountry; and as the mists gradually rose from the sides of the mountains\r\nand we ascended some small hills, I obtained some most beautiful and\r\npicturesque views of the surrounding mountains. The Stauffenberg, which\r\nstood between us and Berchtesgaden, a magnificent mountain, was for a\r\nlong time the most prominent object; backed by the more distant central\r\nportions of the Salzburg Alps, all white with snow. It was only as I\r\nleft this place that I could appreciate the beauty of its situation,\r\nand I felt a momentary regret that I had not stayed a day longer and\r\nvisited Berchtesgaden. These fine mountains and those of the Tyrol (the\r\nmore western portion of the same chain) were in full view during the\r\nwhole journey, filling the southern horizon, while we journeyed through\r\na rather level country; for the whole of Bavaria south of the Danube is\r\na great plain, stretching from that river to these mountains that skirt\r\nits southern border. It is an inclined plain, since Munich, though in a\r\nperfectly flat region, is about sixteen hundred feet above the level of\r\nthe sea. We crossed the frontier in an hour after we started, where our\r\nbaggage was slightly and very civilly examined, and our passports viséd\r\nby the Bavarian police. We passed two pretty lakes, but no place of\r\ninterest except Wasserburg, situated in a picturesque dell on the river\r\nInn. For companions I had a Dane, who spoke a little English\r\nsurprisingly well, and was very agreeable; a German, who spoke a little\r\nFrench; and a Frenchman, who had come up the Danube from Constantinople,\r\nand who tired us all with the continual clack of his very disagreeable\r\nvoice. I took up my abode at the Schwarzer Adler, a very comfortable and\r\nquite cheap hotel; slept pretty well; rose early this morning to take a\r\nlook at the town, which within these last twenty years has become a\r\nmagnificent capital; saw many of the public buildings,--that is, their\r\nexterior,--churches, and squares; went to the office of the police and\r\nobtained the required permission de séjour; and then went to the Royal\r\nCabinet to find Martius, for whom I had three letters of introduction.\r\nHe is a small man, not so tall as I, quite thin, but rather\r\ngood-looking, apparently fifty years old, but his hair may be\r\nprematurely gray. He seems to have his hands very full of business, but\r\nhe received me with cordiality; took me to the library and the cabinet\r\nof natural history, which are in the same building, told me to amuse\r\nmyself till one (the universal dinner hour), and meet him at the Botanic\r\nGarden at three, and afterwards spend the evening at his house. The\r\ncabinets here are in an old, rather inconvenient building, once a\r\nJesuits’ college, which now contains them all, as well as the library,\r\nthe lecture-rooms of the university, etc., but in a year or so all will\r\nbe removed to very fine buildings the king is erecting for their\r\nreception. Excepting the Brazilian collections, which are large and\r\ngood, there is nothing worth particular notice in the zoölogical and\r\nmineralogical cabinets; they make no great show after that of Vienna.\r\nThe library is immense, this and the one at Paris being the two largest\r\nin the world; the books fill a great number of rooms, none of them\r\nmagnificent but very convenient; the whole is soon to be transferred to\r\nother quarters. I was introduced to one of the librarians, who was at\r\nthe moment showing the curiosities of the collection, very old and rich\r\nmanuscripts,--the earliest attempts at wood-engraving, etc.,--to a party\r\nof English. When he had done with them I told him he must have been\r\nbored quite sufficiently for once, and that I would not trouble him any\r\nfurther just then, but that I wished to acquire some useful information\r\nabout the plan and arrangement of the library, rather than to see its\r\ncuriosities. So he fixed upon Friday morning, when he would be quite\r\ndisengaged, and would gladly afford me all the information I desired.\r\nShortly after dinner I went down to the Botanic Garden; found Martius,\r\nwho, having an unexpected engagement, consigned me to the head\r\ngardener, and I was very kindly shown over the whole establishment,\r\nwhich is much larger and better than I had supposed, and in excellent\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I strolled about the town for an hour or two, heard the fine\r\nmilitary band in the Hofgarten, and at half past six went to the house\r\nof Martius; saw his wife, who looks much younger than he, and I suspect\r\nhe was not married until after his return from Brazil. She seems a very\r\nintelligent and pleasant lady, understands English pretty well, but does\r\nnot speak it, while Martius speaks extremely well; the eldest daughter,\r\na pretty girl of thirteen, speaks French fluently, has taken lessons in\r\nEnglish, which she reads readily, but speaks slightly; there is another\r\ndaughter of about ten, another still younger, and a boy a little more\r\nthan a year old completes the list. Professor Zuccarini[108] was there,\r\nand afterwards an entomologist, whose name I forget, dropped in; also a\r\nyoung man from Rio Janeiro, a Dr. Hentz from Vienna, who inquired\r\nespecially after Dr. Buck; the director of the music in the royal chapel\r\nhere; and two ladies, one of whom sung exquisitely. The director and Dr.\r\nHentz both played the piano to perfection, and, to crown all, Martius\r\nseized his fiddle, quite to my surprise, and played with great spirit.\r\nBefore they were done a little crowd had began to assemble before the\r\nwindows. So the evening passed off very pleasantly.\r\n\r\nI like the sound of the German language much; it is manly, and certainly\r\nnot more rough than the English. From the lips of the women and the\r\nlittle children I assure you it sounds very musical, and I often stop\r\nin the street to listen to it, when I do not understand a word that is\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n13th June, 1839.--I passed the whole morning, that is, until one\r\no’clock, at the Botanical Cabinet, looking at grass and such like. After\r\ndinner Zuccarini called for me, took me to his house, showed me his\r\nJapan plants, the work he is publishing on them, etc. I looked over and\r\nnamed his American Cyperaceæ, and he made me most bountiful offers for\r\nexchange. He gave me some of his publications and even offered me his\r\n“Japan Flora” (Siebold’s), which is an expensive work, but it is very\r\ndesirable for us to have, though it will be rather difficult for me to\r\ngive him an equivalent. It is now sunset, eight o’clock; all the shops\r\nin the town have been closed nearly an hour, the people all enjoying\r\nthemselves in the gardens roundabout. I am going to bed early, in hopes\r\nto rise in time to go down to the Garden and hear Martius lecture at\r\nseven o’clock. He lectures every morning at that hour, and Zuccarini\r\nagain every morning from eight to nine, and also from eleven to twelve.\r\nThe scientific people here have been arranging a little fête for\r\nSaturday, the birthday of Linnæus. It is decided that there is to be a\r\nbotanical excursion, I believe, to the Tegernsee, some fifteen miles\r\noff, and I suppose also a picnic dinner. I have not learned all the\r\nparticulars, but this I shall do in time, as I am to be one of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n14th June, 1839.--I rose early this morning and went to hear Martius\r\nlecture at the Garden at seven o’clock. He is a good lecturer, fluent\r\nand clear. Called on Dr. Schultes;[109] then returned to breakfast;\r\nafterwards spent the morning at the cabinet, with the exception of an\r\nhour devoted to the library, which one of the chief officers very kindly\r\nshowed me through. They have about half a million books, excluding\r\nduplicates, and about 16,000 manuscripts. The librarian took much pains\r\nto explain to me the arrangement and classification of the library,\r\nwhich is in excellent order, and to show me as many of the rarities as I\r\ndesired to see: very ancient Greek and Latin manuscripts of the Bible or\r\nthe Evangelists; a number of very old and richly illuminated German\r\nmanuscripts; the collection of printed books without date, of which they\r\nhad 6000 (these early printed books being many of them intended to pass\r\nfor manuscripts); a copy of Faust’s Bible again (the first book\r\nprinted),--they have two; Luther’s Bible, beautifully printed on vellum,\r\nand illuminated,--in the frontispiece his original portrait, a\r\nsturdy-looking old fellow, who looks as if he might have been as\r\nfearless as indeed he was; the portrait of Melanchthon, by the same\r\nartist, whose name I forget, is given on the next leaf. I saw also a\r\nmanuscript letter of Luther, and many other things, too tedious to\r\ntrouble you with now.\r\n\r\nDined with Martius and his very pleasant family; stayed until six\r\no’clock, looking over plants, etc.; took a little walk, now that it is a\r\nlittle cooler, for the day has been exceedingly sultry, and am now going\r\nto bed, as I have to rise at half past four and meet the pedestrian\r\nportion of the Linnæan party at half past five. If it be as sultry a day\r\nas this has been we shall have warm work of it.\r\n\r\n15th June, 1839.--We had a truly German fête champêtre, and I have\r\nlearnt more of German life and manners in one day than I could otherwise\r\nhave obtained in a long time. I was at the place of rendezvous at the\r\ntime appointed, and met there the two professors and about thirty\r\nstudents, with whom we set out on our excursion, and our number was soon\r\ndoubled by the accessions we received. Our course lay along the banks of\r\nthe Isar (what lad that has been at school has not heard of “Isar\r\nrolling rapidly”), along which we ascended for about six miles,\r\nbotanizing on the way. It was about twelve o’clock when we reached the\r\nplace where the Linnæan celebrations are always held. Here we found\r\nMadame Martius and the girls, who had arrived in a carriage, and the\r\nlady and children of another professor. Three or four other professors\r\nalso joined the party: Professor Tirsch, the celebrated Grecian scholar;\r\nProfessor Neumann, of Oriental languages; a celebrated physician, and\r\nsome others. We filled an immense rustic dinner-table spread in an open\r\npavilion, ornamented in a simple manner with branches and flowers, and a\r\nportrait of Linnæus. Professor Martius then read his address, which I\r\njudged from its effects upon the audience to be humorous; then followed\r\nthe dinner, plain but good, consisting of three or four courses, beer\r\nsupplied ad libitum, and this was no trifle, as you would understand if\r\nyou could see how all these Bavarians swill their beer. It is light,\r\nextremely light as compared with English. But you may judge how cheaply\r\nthe Germans contrive to live, and how cheaply and simply they get up an\r\naffair which in England or at home would cost a round sum, when I inform\r\nyou that the whole charge for dinner was twenty-four kreutzers or one\r\nAustrian zwanziger (sixteen cents!). This I suppose did not include the\r\nwine, of which there was a small supply, provided, perhaps, by Martius\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThree or four odes, written for the purpose, some in Latin, others in\r\nGerman, were sung, with a heartiness and a nicety of execution entirely\r\nGerman. Three or four toasts were drunk, some speeches made, and the\r\nparty left the table. The greater part, excluding the ladies, then went\r\nto the Linnæan Oak, a young tree planted on the day of this fête five\r\nyears ago. Here all took their seats on the grass around it, and a\r\nnumber of half-serious, half-humorous addresses or meditations were\r\nmade, the people all sitting at their ease; then a song for the purpose\r\nwas sung, and the celebration was over. Some part dispersed immediately,\r\nbut the greater part assembled around our dinner-table, and heard some\r\nmusic from a paysanne, who accompanied her voice with an instrument like\r\na guitar. Martius and Zuccarini had arranged to stay over night in the\r\nneighborhood to botanize to-morrow, and wished me to stay also, which I\r\ndeclined to do, but returned in a carriage with Madame Martius and the\r\neldest daughter. We had a very agreeable ride and reached the city just\r\nas it grew dark. We had all day most beautiful views of the Bavarian\r\nAlps, which seemed close to us. The different professors spoke English\r\nwith me, Professor Neumann, indeed, extremely well; were very polite to\r\nme, and I obtained much important information, and have put myself in\r\nthe way to get still more. The whole affair was extremely well arranged.\r\nI have printed copies of a part of the odes, and a copy of the print of\r\nLinnæus, a very good lithograph, which was brought to the place and sold\r\nto the students for twenty-four kreutzers (sixteen cents) a copy. This\r\nis not the birthday of Linnæus; the 24th of May is the proper one, but\r\nit is not then pleasant in the country here.\r\n\r\n18th June.--On Sunday I attended service in the Protestant church, a\r\nlarge and fine building, which was well filled. A part of the royal\r\nfamily are Protestants, but the king himself is a bigoted Catholic. The\r\ninterior of the church is made to resemble a Catholic chapel as much as\r\npossible; the altar has a picture behind it, and a small crucifix stood\r\nupon the reading-desk. There was a very short liturgy, and singing in\r\nwhich all the congregation took part, as is always the case in Germany.\r\nThe sermon which followed may have been very orthodox for all I know,\r\nfor I could understand but a few words of it. I spent the remainder of\r\nthe day in my own room....\r\n\r\nTuesday evening.--This morning I went to the cabinet of botany, to the\r\nlibrary, and after dinner to Martius; looked over his Carices, etc. We\r\nthen walked to the Garden, and afterward to the establishment for\r\ntelescopes, etc., of the successors of Fraunhöfer, where I bought a very\r\npretty little achromatic glass and a simple lens; looked at his workshop\r\nand collections, etc....\r\n\r\nIt is so long since I have seen your handwriting that I might forget it,\r\nbut I met with it to-day very unexpectedly, you would never guess where!\r\nEven on labels of Carices in Martius’ herbarium. After I get to\r\nSwitzerland I shall count days until I see England again, from which\r\nthere are but two steps home, on board a ship, and off again.\r\n\r\nZURICH, June 22, 1839.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I called on Dr. Schultes, who offered me a pretty\r\nlittle parcel of Egyptian plants. Made up my parcels and left them with\r\nMartius, to be sent, with the things that he and Zuccarini are to add,\r\nto Hamburg, against my arrival there. Spent the evening at Martius’\r\nhouse, and took my leave of madame and Caroline. I gave Madame M. my\r\ncopy of “Childe Harold,” a very pretty one, which she seemed to value\r\nconsiderably. Martius I saw again the next morning at the cabinet, and\r\ntook leave very affectionately; he kissing me tenderly, after the German\r\nfashion. Ask Dr. Torrey to look in the list and see if Martius is not an\r\nhonorary member of the Lyceum, as I believe, but am not sure. If he is\r\nhe knows it not. The Lyceum has also been remiss in sending him the\r\n“Annals,” which should not be, as he has been a liberal contributor. His\r\nworks give him much trouble since the death of the late king, who was\r\nhis patron and subscribed toward the expense; the present king does\r\nnothing at all for Martius or for science anyway, so that poor Martius\r\nis a little embarrassed. Meanwhile he is pressed down with his duties as\r\nprofessor, director of the Botanic Garden, etc., for which he is most\r\nmiserably paid.\r\n\r\nThe Botanic Garden is better arranged than any other I have seen on the\r\nContinent, except at Paris, and I have secured a copy of the plan. But I\r\nmust break off with Munich.--Arrived at Lindan, on Lake of Constance,\r\nyesterday; a fine lake, but too large to show well; the shores only at\r\nthe eastern end mountainous; the rest ordinary, and in high cultivation,\r\ndotted with thriving villages; took a steamboat after dinner for\r\nConstance....\r\n\r\nON THE RIGI, 25th June.\r\n\r\nI must resume the thread of my narrative where I left it, at my entrance\r\nto Zurich. I did nothing that evening but look about the town, visit the\r\nold church where Zwingli, the earliest Swiss reformer, preached. The\r\nprettiest view is from the new stone bridge which is thrown across the\r\nLimmat just where it emerges from the lake. The stream, like all those\r\nthat proceed from these lakes, is full, and clear almost as glass, of a\r\nfine blue tint; it rushes with great rapidity, but is still and even.\r\nThe view extends up the lake to its middle, where a slight change in its\r\ndirection intercepts further view; beyond rise some low mountains; a\r\nlittle farther a higher range overtops these, and these are again\r\noverlooked by the Alps of Glarns, Schwyz, etc., with thin tall peaks and\r\nbrilliant glaciers. The shores of the lake are highly cultivated and\r\nthickly covered with little manufacturing villages. This is a Protestant\r\ncanton. I attended church and heard a preacher who seemed to be very\r\nearnest, but as his language was an unknown tongue, there was little\r\nchance of my being edified, and I spent the remainder of the day at my\r\nroom. The new hotel here is extremely good. Early yesterday morning I\r\nprepared myself for a pedestrian excursion over the finest mountain\r\nregions of Switzerland, which will take me about ten days, if I do not\r\nget tired of it and give it up. Not that I intend to walk all the way,\r\nwhich would be a great loss of time, but to avail myself of steamboats,\r\netc., along lakes, and a diligence when I am on routes which they\r\ntraverse, knowing full well that there will remain many weary and\r\ndifficult miles that can only be passed by the pedestrian. So I have\r\npacked up my trunk and sent it on to Geneva, at the opposite corner of\r\nSwitzerland. The garçon of the hotel purchased a knapsack for me....\r\nThus equipped, my knapsack on my back, the Guide to Switzerland in one\r\npocket, and Keller’s excellent map in the other, I set out on my\r\ntravels in search of the sublime. At nine o’clock yesterday morning I\r\nleft Zurich; took the steamboat down the lake as far as Horgen, some\r\neight or ten miles, where I took a little lunch, and crossed the bridge\r\ninto the little canton of Zug,--Catholic, as one soon finds out, by the\r\ncrosses and beggars which abound by the wayside. Here the lofty Mont\r\nPilate, with its sharp peaks, was in sight; it lies on the other side of\r\nLake Lucerne. Soon after I saw the Lake of Zug, and soon after one\r\no’clock I reached Zug, on the borders of the lake of the same name, the\r\ncapital of the canton, a retired and lifeless village. I entered the\r\nbest hotel well heated with my walk, which now amounted to about twelve\r\nmiles. I obtained a plain but very good dinner of soup, the everlasting\r\ncorned beef, fish, roast, and strawberries and cherries ad libitum;\r\nchatted French with the voluble kellnerinn (the demoiselle of the inn);\r\npaid my bill of two francs, and was again on my way. It was very warm,\r\nso I walked quite leisurely down the shore of the lake; the scenery\r\ngrowing every moment more picturesque, the Rigi rising at its foot on\r\none side, bold and abrupt, the Rossberg on the other. (A sad tale\r\nbelongs to this last, of which I had often read.) I reached Arth, the\r\nlittle village at the foot of the lake and of these two mountains, at\r\nhalf past four (seven miles); took more strawberries and milk, and at\r\nfive o’clock commenced the ascent of the Rigi by the shortest but most\r\ndifficult footpath. The landlord told me the ascent took four hours and\r\na half. This, indeed, I accomplished, but found it a hard task. But the\r\ndesire of witnessing the sunset from the top induced me to do my best. I\r\nhad plenty of offers to relieve me of my knapsack, and at length, as I\r\nleft the village, transferred it to the shoulders of a stout fellow,\r\nfor it began to grow weighty. The poor fellow I think earned the ten\r\nbatz he demanded (about thirty cents), though he did not seem to mind it\r\nmuch. The first third of the ascent the path is formed of steps like a\r\nstaircase, and is very fatiguing. After we meet the road for mules or\r\nhorses, which ascends from Goldau, it is not so difficult. Both in the\r\nascent and from the summit, I had a full view of the vestiges of the\r\nawful landslip of the Rossberg; the vacant space of the mountain\r\noccupied by the portion that fell and the scarred surface of the path\r\nare most distinctly in view, and at the bottom of the valley lies the\r\nhuge and unsightly and confused mass of rubbish which overwhelmed and\r\nburied the three villages of Goldau, Bussingen, and Rothen. This\r\ncatastrophe took place in September, 1806. Several hundred houses and\r\nother buildings were destroyed; cattle in great number, and four hundred\r\nand fifty human beings perished....\r\n\r\nBut time is becoming precious, and I must tell you in a few words of the\r\nview from the summit of the Rigi, though description is wholly out of\r\nthe question. The view from the Kulm, or peak, owes its great beauty and\r\nextent, not so much to the height of the mountain, which is only 5676\r\nfeet, as to its isolation, giving a clear view in every direction. It is\r\nalso easy of access; ladies and persons who do not care to walk can ride\r\nup on horses or mules, by either side of the mountain. So there are\r\ngreat crowds here all the summer....\r\n\r\nI was called in the morning at half past three to ascend the peak and\r\nwatch the effect of sunrise upon the Alps and valleys. The morning\r\nproved quite favorable, though a little cloudy. The mountains, lakes,\r\nand valleys were all distinct, but looked cold. At length a blast from\r\na wooden trumpet (a better instrument than you would think) announced\r\nsunrise, and the sun appeared between two strips of cloud, lighting up\r\nfirst the distant and high peaks and glaciers of the Bernese Alps, the\r\nJungfrau, the Finster-Aarhorn, the Titlis, highest of all,--the white\r\nglaciers shining like burnished silver. Soon the serrated ridge of the\r\ngloomy Pilatus is lighted up; the dark valleys become more distinct; the\r\nlakes look brighter, and the broad valley toward the north stretches\r\nbefore you like a map, far as the eye can reach, covered with hamlets\r\nand villages, and diversified here and there with beautiful lakes....\r\n\r\nStanz, 25th June.... I intended to leave the Rigi by way of Wäggis on\r\nLake Lucerne; to take there the steamboat as it passed at two o’clock,\r\nand go up the farther part of the lake, the Bay of Uri, and finding, if\r\npossible, the mail-courier at Fluellen, to go with him to the summit of\r\nthe pass of St. Gotthard, return as far as Hospital, and cross by the\r\npass of the Furca and the Grimsel to Grindelwald, etc. If you had\r\nKeller’s fine map before you, it would be easy to trace this route, and\r\nto find out also where I now am. Without it you will not do it so\r\neasily. So having plenty of time, I stayed on the Rigi until noon, and\r\nthen descended leisurely, having grown wise by experience, and knowing\r\nthat the descent of a steep mountain is much worse for the legs and feet\r\nthan the ascent. Besides, a little storm arose, and I took shelter under\r\nan overhanging rock, and amused myself in watching its progress down the\r\nlake, and in hearing the deep and prolonged echoes of the thunder as it\r\nwas reverberated from peak to peak among the Alps. It was a scene to be\r\nremembered. And then the numerous ever-changing aspects of the\r\nmountains and lake as it cleared up! Saw the steamboat at a distance,\r\nand hastened to the foot of the mountain, when it soon became evident\r\nenough that the boat did not intend to touch there; so we took a boat\r\nand went out to meet it. But although we drew very near them as they\r\npassed, they did not choose to take the slightest notice of us, and I\r\nwas obliged, in the middle of the lake, to consider what should be done\r\nin such a predicament. I had no intention of awaiting the return of the\r\nsteamboat and going with her to Lucerne, thence to begin the route\r\nto-morrow; and for a few moments I was a little bothered. But\r\nfortunately a pedestrian like me is not at the mercy of steamboats and\r\nstagecoaches; and the high satisfaction one feels at his comparative\r\nindependence is one of the great pleasures of this mode of locomotion,\r\nand goes far to compensate for the fatigue. I reflected that I might not\r\nfind the courier at Fluellen, and in that case should have a prodigious\r\njourney, and moreover that I had clearly saved the money I should have\r\npaid. So, learning on hasty inquiry that a blind mountain path led from\r\nthe opposite shore into the canton of Unterwalden to Stanz, etc.,--from\r\nwhence I knew I could reach the Grimsel, and if I chose St. Gotthard,\r\nand that it was the nearest way to the Grindelwald and all the finest\r\npart of Switzerland,--I ordered the boat to take me to that shore, where\r\nI was accordingly left to shift for myself as well as I could. But then\r\ncame on one of the ills that flesh is heir to, most especially in\r\ntraveling,--I wanted my dinner! I stopped at a cottage, the only one in\r\nthe vicinity, but found no one but a little girl, who stared at me as if\r\nshe had never seen a civilized being; saw no chance of getting anything\r\nto eat, so I climbed the mountain, very steep, and almost without a\r\npath; it evidently had not been crossed before, this season. From the\r\ntop I saw the bay and village of Buochs, and in the distance, Stanz,\r\nwhich I reached at six o’clock; found an inn which within was more\r\ncomfortable than its exterior promised. I think I never enjoyed anything\r\nmore than the piece of cold roast veal and coarse bread, and the\r\nplentiful dish of strawberries with excellent cream that followed. Now\r\nthat I had got out of the ordinary route of travelers, I determined to\r\nvisit the valley of Engelberg. I asked the landlord for a char-à-banc\r\n(as there is a good enough road for this vehicle) or a horse, to go this\r\nevening, but mine host seemed to have made up his mind that I should\r\nstay with him all night, and insisted that there would not be time for\r\nEngelberg. So not to disappoint him, I made up my mind to rest for the\r\nnight, and sallied out to look at the village....\r\n\r\nMEYRINGEN, 26th June.\r\n\r\nI have accomplished a journey to-day, such as I think few pedestrians\r\nhave ever surpassed, considering the difficulties of a great part of the\r\nway,--from Stanz to Engelberg, thirteen miles, then over a tremendous\r\nmountain, the Joch, 6890 feet high, among the snows and near the\r\nglaciers of the Titlis and the Wendenstock, and then by a long path,\r\nthrough the most sublime mountain gorge and valley of Engstlen, to\r\nMeyringen. The distance from Engelberg is reckoned at nine hours (they\r\nalways reckon by hours here), which on ordinary routes would be thirty\r\nmiles. I do not know how far it really is. I accomplished it between\r\nhalf past eleven A.M. and half past seven P.M., and am fatigued past all\r\nconception, completely done over, and my feet apparently spoiled.\r\nTo-morrow, perhaps, I will tell you something about it.\r\n\r\nGRINDELWALD, Thursday, half past five, 27th June.\r\n\r\nI take the first leisure hour to resume my account. I find that I must\r\nhave walked about thirty-four miles yesterday, making due allowance for\r\nthe windings of the path. I commenced at five o’clock, reached Engelberg\r\nat nine, where I rested till half past eleven, and reached Meyringen, as\r\nI said before, at half past seven. The journey from Stanz is through a\r\nnarrow but fertile valley inclosed by high and picturesque mountains for\r\nabout seven miles, when the valley contracts, the mountains on each side\r\nrise to a great height into sharp and bare peaks, leaving barely room\r\nfor the Aar to descend between. It forms, I may say, one continual\r\ncataract from Engelberg to this point. Before this pass is reached I had\r\ngone by some other mountains which were very remarkable; among them the\r\nBrisenstock, a ridge of rock like the upturned edge of a hatchet, some\r\n6,000 feet high, and throwing up from one extremity a column of rock\r\nlike a vast obelisk. The road, which is carried at considerable\r\nelevation along one side of this narrow valley, is not difficult, and\r\nexhibits the whole way the most sublime scenery. The Wallenstock rises\r\non one side to the height of above 8,000 feet; and those on the other\r\nside are not less lofty. Presently the shining summit of the Titlis\r\nrises before you, surrounded by others scarcely less elevated. The\r\nTitlis is the highest of the Unterwalden Alps, 10,710 feet. You then\r\narrive at a place where the Aar forms a series of cataracts in the\r\nbottom of the gorge, nearly a thousand feet below you; the opposite\r\nmountain exhibits an almost perpendicular wall of rock, nearly 6,000\r\nfeet high, and a little cataract formed by the melting snow above falls\r\nfrom the top to the bottom. Soon I entered the little valley of\r\nEngelberg, the most beautiful and picturesque I have seen, probably the\r\nfinest in Switzerland; at least that of Meyringen and this of\r\nGrindelwald, where I am now writing, are not to be compared with it. I\r\nonly wonder it is so little known. I think it not improbable that I am\r\nthe first American that has visited it. It is far out of the ordinary\r\nroutes, and though easily accessible with chars from Stanz, yet the\r\nthree passes that lead out of it are excessively difficult footpaths. It\r\nis a green, sunshiny valley, having perhaps eighty acres of plain, but\r\nvery rich pastures rise up the mountain-sides to some distance; it is\r\nentirely shut in by the high mountains that rise on every side; the\r\nTitlis rising abruptly on the south within a few yards of the village,\r\nand sending down its avalanches in the spring close to the houses. But\r\nthe glaciers are so situated as to send their summer avalanches in the\r\nother direction, so that the hamlet is not in danger; the other\r\nmountains toward the south have the glaciers on their summits, but the\r\npeaks on the other sides present naked precipices. The Engelberg, from\r\nwhich the hamlet is named (angel-mountain) is a lofty mountain shaped\r\nlike a slender cone, with the apex cut off obliquely. It rises almost\r\nwithin the valley, and presents a very curious appearance. The large\r\nconvent stands just between the base of this mountain and the Titlis.\r\nAttached to it is a very large and fine church for such an\r\nout-of-the-world place. I stopped at the simple auberge of the Engel\r\n(angel); mine host could only speak or understand German and Italian, so\r\nthat our communication took place mostly by signs and single words, I\r\ngiving him the German names as far as I could of what I wished. I got a\r\nvery comfortable lunch of cold roast meat; but I wanted some\r\nstrawberries, and could not think of the German name, and had\r\nconsiderable difficulty. At length he seemed dubiously to comprehend\r\nwhat I wanted; he went out, and returned in a few moments with a fine\r\ndish of the article in question. Excellent cream is as common as need\r\nbe; so I had a fine feast. I found that I was the first visitor here\r\nthis season. I amused myself with looking over the travelers’ book\r\n(which you always find) and reading the remarks of former visitors. An\r\nEnglishman the summer before had ascended the highest peak of the\r\nTitlis. I afterwards saw that this could readily be done, as my route\r\nled me close to the top of the main body of the mountain.\r\n\r\nTo get into the valley of the Aar it was necessary to cross the Joch, a\r\nmountain connected with the Titlis, and almost as high. The pass between\r\nthe two mountains is almost 7,000 feet at the summit, is covered with\r\nsnow, and is in immediate proximity with the glaciers of the Titlis. The\r\nascent is exceedingly difficult; indeed, from all I can learn, it is\r\nmuch more difficult than any of the passes at all frequented by\r\ntravelers. I took a guide to the summit and some distance beyond, as a\r\nstranger could never have found the way. My guide was an old man of\r\nsixty years. From a high ridge near the summit, which belonged rather to\r\nthe Titlis, I had a magnificent view of the mountains to the north and\r\nthe valley I had passed through, and on the other side, close to us, of\r\na vast glacier; the streams emerging from it formed a small river, which\r\nwe had some difficulty in crossing, and which emptied into a dark\r\nalpine lake just below. Here I gathered a few alpine plants, as\r\nsouvenirs of the place. Another weary climb over the snow brought us to\r\nthe top of the Joch, and here, where shelter was impossible, we were\r\nexposed to a shower, but our umbrellas protected us in part, and the\r\nview repaid for a little wetting. Descending a little, my guide showed\r\nme a lake almost surrounded with snow, fed by the glaciers; the outlet,\r\nthe source of one branch of the Aar, was the stream which flowed down\r\nthe valley I was to descend to Meyringen; the knapsack was again\r\ntransferred to my shoulders and I was left to myself. As I entered the\r\nvalley of Engstlen the scenery grew wonderfully fine. Tired as I was I\r\nenjoyed the whole journey extremely, though it took me four hours and a\r\nhalf of continual descent; yet I look back upon it with delight. The\r\nmain stream formed a succession of beautiful cascades; the mountains on\r\neach side very high, and mostly perpendicular faces of rock, and down\r\nthese a great multitude of cascades of all sizes fell, some of them\r\nspringing 500 feet at a leap; others, falling from much greater height\r\nover the rocks, looked like long skeins of yarn, if you will pardon the\r\nsimile, dangling in the air. It must be much like the valley of the\r\nLauterbrunnen, according to the description; but I think the latter\r\ncannot excel it. I hope to know to-morrow. A shower drove me into a\r\nmiserable châlet, the highest one inhabited at this season, where I\r\nfound a young man, who dwelt there for the summer, with his herd of\r\ngoats, and his brother, a young lad of fifteen, who had come up from\r\nMeyringen to bring him some food, etc., and was just about to return, I\r\ndrank about a quart of milk fresh from the goat, and found it excellent.\r\nWhen it stopped raining the youngster and I started together; I\r\ntransferred my knapsack to his shoulders, and a franc and a half to his\r\npocket, to the great satisfaction of both parties. He proved a very\r\nuseful little fellow, though I could not understand much of what he\r\nsaid; he showed me some waterfalls and curious things that I should\r\notherwise have missed. With the true spirit of his nation, ever ready to\r\nimprove an opportunity, he told me he had a brother who spoke French,\r\nwho would be my guide for the next day. It rained most of the way, but I\r\nwas compensated for the partial wetting by the views of the most\r\nbeautiful waterfalls, which fell into the valley in great profusion from\r\nthe high precipices on each side. I could sometimes see twenty at one\r\nview. After a long and weary descent we came at last near the bottom,\r\nwhere this valley, and two others almost at the same point, fell into\r\nthe main valley of the Aar, and I could look at the same moment up four\r\ndeep and wild mountain valleys. Then skirting along the side of the\r\nmountain, we soon descended to Meyringen, deep in the main valley of the\r\nAar, with two fine cascades behind it, and another very fine one, the\r\ncascade of the Reichenbach, on the opposite side of the valley. Glad\r\nenough was I when we reached the door of the humble auberge, and great\r\nwas the havoc I made with the eatables which the kind landlady provided\r\nin abundance and of excellent quality. I sat down on a sofa in my\r\nchamber to read a little, but fell asleep instantly; slept until eleven,\r\nthen took my bed and slept until half past seven in the morning.\r\n\r\nI can say, with Sancho Panza, “Blest be the man who first invented\r\nsleep.” In the evening, what with my great fatigue and blistered feet, I\r\nsupposed I should be scarcely able to move the next day, and that\r\ntraveling on foot would be impossible. But I awoke perfectly restored,\r\nmy limbs supple and my feet much better than I had anticipated; my guide\r\nmade his appearance while I was at breakfast; said that it would take\r\nthree days to make the excursion over the Great Scheideck to\r\nGrindelwald, then over the Lesser to the Wengern Alp, to Lauterbrunnen,\r\nand back to Meyringen by Interlaken and the Lake of Brienz. I insisted\r\nthat it should be done in two, with the aid of a char from Brienz, at\r\nthe end of the second day. Leaving my knapsack here, and taking a few\r\nthings in our pockets, we set out at half past nine; stopped on our way\r\nto see the falls of the Reichenbach, where the stream of the valley we\r\nwere climbing makes the descent of 2,000 feet in a succession of leaps;\r\nthe longest forms the celebrated falls,--very fine. Farther above\r\nnumerous waterfalls are seen dangling from the perpendicular sides of\r\nthe narrow valley; one, remarkably high and slender, is called the\r\nSeilbach (rope-fall). Ascended through beautiful mountain pastures,\r\ndotted with châlets; the peak of the Wetterhorn in full view directly\r\nbefore us, a sharp pyramid, one side dark rock, the other pure white\r\nsnow. The body of the mountain was still hidden by the Wellhorn, the\r\nfirst of the chain of high Bernese Alps we were approaching (9,500\r\nfeet); then the Engelhörner (angel’s-peaks) and high up between these,\r\nwe had a fine distant view of the most beautiful glacier in Switzerland,\r\nthe Rosenlaui, celebrated above all others for the purity of its\r\nuntarnished white surface, and the clear azure of its depths and\r\ncaverns. Stopped at a little inn, which is occupied only through the\r\nsummer; got an excellent little dinner at half past eleven, charges\r\nmoderate; visited another waterfall, and then walked half an hour out\r\nof our way to the foot of the Rosenlaui glacier, which descends to only\r\n4,200 feet above the level of the sea; found a party there, two\r\ngentlemen and lady, the latter carried in a chair; admired the pure\r\nwhite surface, entered a little way into one of the crevices, looked\r\ndown into the deep azure chasms; returning, viewed the awful gorge\r\nthrough which the stream from the glaciers makes its way, at least 500\r\nfeet deep, and only four or five feet wide, the water rushing and\r\nboiling and roaring in the bottom like mad. Threw down a big stone, and\r\nheard it crashing against the sides and shattered to atoms. Continued up\r\nthe Scheideck, close along the broad and vast perpendicular side of the\r\nWetterhorn; finally reached the summit of the pass (6,040 feet), and\r\nenjoyed the magnificent view of the mountains down the valley of the\r\nGrindelwald. The Wetterhorn (peak of tempests) rises, one vast precipice\r\nof alpine limestone, its base extending from Grindelwald on the one side\r\nalmost to Rosenlaui on the other, and so near us that it seemed easy for\r\na strong man to throw a stone against it, though it is really more than\r\na mile off; its summit is 11,450 feet above the sea; this precipice\r\nconsequently forms a wall about 6,000 feet in height. Next to this is\r\nthe Mettenberg (perhaps 10,000 feet); and next, the great Eiger (giant,\r\n12,220 feet), presenting its long thin edge, like the blade of a hatchet\r\nturned up into the air; while back of the Mettenberg appears the pointed\r\ncone of the Schreckhorn (the peak of terror, 12,500 feet). The vast\r\nspace between these peaks is filled by an immense glacier, here and\r\nthere interrupted, which under various names extends from Rosenlaui and\r\nGrindelwald almost to the Grimsel, and to Brieg in the Valais. The\r\nincreasing supply of ice and the refrigeration of such an immense\r\nquantity forces branches down the valleys far below the level of\r\nperpetual snow, particularly these at Grindelwald, the lowest known; the\r\nbase of the lowermost being little more than 3,000 feet above sea-level.\r\nI descended rapidly, looked down upon the two glaciers just mentioned,\r\nreached the little hamlet of Grindelwald in the bottom of the valley,\r\nclose at the feet of these vast mountains, and a little above the foot\r\nof the lower glacier, which is so close that it seems almost possible to\r\nthrow a stone to it; but I believe it is a mile off; reached here at\r\nfive o’clock (twenty-one miles), having walked very deliberately. It is\r\nnow just at sunset; the day has been warm; but now it is very cold, and\r\nI am shivering too much to hold my pen; besides, it is time for supper,\r\nand I want another view of the mountains. Adieu....\r\n\r\nVilleneuve, 4th July, 1839.... Being unexpectedly detained here for a\r\nfew hours, almost at the close of my Swiss pilgrimage, I resume my pen,\r\nwhich I have had no time to use for some time past, and must bring up my\r\njournal in a hurried way to the present. Since I broke off I have seen\r\nmore than half the wonders of Switzerland. I can only now tell you where\r\nI have been from day to day; but I shall have much to give you viva voce\r\nsome of the evenings of the rapidly approaching autumn. Stayed at\r\nGrindelwald Thursday night (a week ago); watched the clouds striking\r\nagainst the Wetterhorn and the Eiger and rolling down its sides;\r\nterribly cold. Friday, 28th, rose at four; started at five, in fine\r\nwalking trim, after paying an exorbitant bill for very indifferent fare;\r\nwas very confident that the guide paid nothing, and therefore suspected\r\na connivance between him and the aubergiste to put all on my\r\nshoulders,--one of the evils of a guide; they are worse than useless on\r\nall the usual routes, indeed anywhere, except in ascending very high\r\nmountains and crossing glaciers; felt a little inclined to punish my\r\nguide, and therefore set off at a swinging pace and took him up the\r\nLittle Scheideck much more rapidly than he ever went before. I buttoned\r\nup my coat and pretended not to be making any effort at all, while the\r\npoor fellow stripped off first his coat, then his waistcoat, the\r\nperspiration running off his face; until finally he pronounced it\r\nimpossible to keep near me, and lagged far behind. At length I took pity\r\non him and walked slower, but we crossed the Scheideck and reached the\r\nWengern Alp, a journey of four hours and a half, in a little less than\r\nthree....\r\n\r\nFrom the crest of the Little Scheideck (6,300 feet) I got my first near\r\nview of the remainder of the high Bernese Alps,--the Mönch (12,660\r\nfeet), the Jungfrau (12,670 feet) (I have been giving you the height all\r\nalong in French feet, as they are put down in Keller; in English feet\r\nthe numbers will be considerably higher), with the two white peaks, the\r\nSilberhörner (silver-peaks), which belong to it.\r\n\r\nStill beyond, though not quite so lofty, were the Grosshorn, the\r\nBreithorn, etc. The point where I stood commanded nearly the whole view,\r\nfrom the Engelhörner, Wetterhorn, a glimpse of the Schreckhorn, the\r\nMettenberg, Eiger, Mönch, and Jungfrau, as I stood just in the\r\nmid-distance; an unsurpassed view it is. As I descended the other side\r\nto the Wengern Alp I lost those more to the east, but came still nearer\r\nto the Jungfrau....\r\n\r\nAt the Jungfrau hotel, a mere châlet on the side of the Wengern Alp, we\r\nwere close under that magnificent mountain, separated only by a narrow\r\ngorge, and elevated just enough to have the most perfect view from base\r\nto summit. We had heard the day previous the crash and roar of falling\r\navalanches on the other side of the Wetterhorn, and I was very anxious\r\nto see one; before long I saw two, one of them a pretty good one, come\r\ntumbling and roaring down the Jungfrau. Soon a thick cloud came and\r\nenveloped these mountains, so that I departed earlier than I should have\r\ndone; it threatened to rain; and we descended into the valley of\r\nLauterbrunnen, which is very deep and narrow, and had on the way a fine\r\nview of the valley and the mountains and glaciers that close its upper\r\nextremity. Saw the celebrated fall of the Staubbach, and was\r\ndisappointed in it....\r\n\r\nWalked rapidly down the valley of Lauterbrunnen to the lake of Brienz,\r\nturning aside so as not to pass through Interlaken, which is a little\r\nBritish colony; took a boat to the opposite end of the lake (eight\r\nmiles); had a heavy shower and much wind; saw the falls of Giessbach\r\nfrom the lake, seven very fine cascades one above the other. Landed at\r\nBrienz; took a char up to Meyringen again, looking at the beautiful\r\nwaterfalls from each side of the valley, now very full from the rains.\r\nArrived at my own lodgings at five o’clock, having accomplished in the\r\ntwelve hours fifty miles, of which thirty-two were traveled on foot.\r\n\r\nSaturday, 29th, rose in good condition, breakfasted, and parted with my\r\nthoroughly Swiss landlady at five o’clock; went up the vale of Hassli,\r\none of the finest in Switzerland, for the Grimsel, perhaps the wildest\r\nand grandest pass across the Alps. It is a footpath, or at best a\r\nbridle-path. I set out alone, with my knapsack on my back. Ascended a\r\nconsiderable distance when the clouds sunk lower and it began to rain,\r\nthough I had the satisfaction to see down the valley that the sun was\r\nshining at Meyringen. Passed the last little village (Guttannen), a\r\nlonely place; above, the scenery grew to the very height of gloomy\r\ngrandeur: immense blackened granitic mountains, clothed at the base with\r\nblack stunted firs, above all naked tremendous rocks and peaks; between,\r\njust room enough for the river to tumble along, forming here and there a\r\ncataract. The view was heightened much, I doubt not, by the clouds and\r\nstorm, so entirely in character with the scenery. I never before enjoyed\r\na lonely rainy walk so much.\r\n\r\nAt the height of about 4,500 feet, and in the midst of the very wildest\r\nand most lonely scenery, reached the falls of the Aar at Handek, the\r\nfinest in Switzerland,--indeed the only sublime waterfall here; viewed\r\nit first from below, then from the rude bridge thrown across just a few\r\nfeet above where it leaps into the awful gorge. The scenery and all is\r\nin character, and for savage grandeur I have seen nothing to compare\r\nwith it. Stopped at the châlet near the only dwelling within some miles;\r\nwaited a little for the rain to subside, and finding that even here a\r\ntraveler’s first wants had been pretty well provided for, I made an\r\nearly but most excellent dinner upon bread, butter, cheese, and honey,\r\nthe last especially excellent. No signs of better weather; so started\r\non, passing a spot where falling avalanches every winter and spring had\r\nswept over a vast space of rock and completely worn it smooth; was now\r\nabove trees, with here and there a bit of scanty vegetation, but almost\r\nevery step to the end was now on rock or snow, and I walked on to the\r\nhospice near the summit in the midst of a snowstorm, one and a half\r\nhours; knowing it could scarcely accumulate sufficiently to obstruct or\r\nobscure entirely the path until I could reach the place of shelter, I\r\nenjoyed it intensely, but had quite enough when, at one o’clock, I\r\nreached the hospice (twenty miles), near the summit of the pass,\r\nsurrounded with unmelted snow, more than 6,000 English feet above the\r\nsea. It is as comfortable a place as can be expected in such a\r\nsituation, now kept as a kind of inn during the summer, and in winter\r\nleft in charge of a single servant, with a store of provisions to last\r\nhim until spring. The winter before last it was crushed by an avalanche,\r\nbut the man and his dog escaped, and reached Meyringen in safety. It is\r\nnow repaired; the stone walls are extremely thick, the roof protected\r\nagainst the winds, as is usual here, by laying huge stones upon it. Laid\r\naside part of my wet clothes, and lay down before the fire to dry the\r\nremainder; fell asleep; on waking had just begun to write, but when I\r\nhad given the heading, in came three more travelers: two Germans, whom I\r\nhad met before at Grindelwald, and a young Englishman; all thoroughly\r\nwet with the storm, which was now more violent. We all had to huddle\r\nabout the fire, so there was an end of writing.\r\n\r\nAwoke Sunday morning and found myself in mid-winter; very cold, snowing\r\nhard, and the wind howling frightfully around our humble but snug place\r\nof refuge. The other travelers determined to prosecute their journey,\r\nspite of the Sabbath or the storm, and to go by way of the glacier of\r\nthe Rhone, the other side of the summit of the pass and about four\r\nmiles distant. They sallied out with their guide and left me to myself,\r\nwhich was one advantage. But in three hours they returned, giving an\r\nalarming account of the difficulties and dangers of the way. When just\r\nabandoning the attempt they heard a cry for help, and succeeded in\r\nrescuing another party of three with their guide, who had lost their way\r\nin the thick mist and storm and were wandering about in the drifts,\r\nsuffering extremely with the cold, and who, as well as their guide, had\r\ngiven up all hope of reaching the hospice unless their cries should\r\nperchance be heard and bring them aid. All returned to the hospice\r\ntogether, and no further attempts to leave it were made that day. When\r\nleft alone I had the fire to myself, and was spending the time in as\r\nprofitable a manner as possible, thinking a little, too, of the\r\nstrangeness of passing the day in such an elevated position; so their\r\nreturn, with an accession to their company, though very desirable for\r\nthem, was not so favorable to me. And then of all people in the world\r\nthe Germans are the noisiest talkers; Frenchmen are nothing to them; the\r\nfire which dried their clothes and warmed their fingers loosened their\r\ntongues, and they kept up a continual gabble for the greater part of the\r\nday. Scarcely a winter passes that some persons are not lost in this\r\npass during such storms. A gloomy lake on the summit of the mountain,\r\ninto which the bodies are thrown for burial, receives the name of “The\r\nLake of the Dead” (Todten-See).\r\n\r\nMonday morning, still enveloped in the clouds, but the storm apparently\r\nover. Found it no use trying to make a visit to the Rhone glacier; the\r\nclouds were so thick we could scarcely hope to find it, and the recent\r\nsnow so deep nothing could be seen. Was disappointed also by these same\r\nclouds in getting a view of the high Bernese Alps, particularly\r\nFinster-Aarhorn and the glaciers, from this side, but determined not to\r\nwait here longer; so set off at half past ten in company with a native\r\nof Valais, who was traveling towards home and served as guide; traveled\r\nthrough deep snow, climbed up to the summit of the pass, more than a\r\nthousand feet higher, where at first we were so completely enveloped in\r\nthe clouds that we seemed actually to be traveling through them and on\r\nthem; dug a specimen or two of Soldanella out of the snow to serve as\r\nsouvenirs. At length the wind arose and now and then sent a hole in the\r\nclouds to give me some glimpses of the desolate yet grand scenery\r\nthrough which we were passing. Soon I got a view of the valley of the\r\nRhone almost at its commencement, with the river flowing through like a\r\nmere rivulet; looked down upon Oberwald, the highest village in Valais,\r\na collection of little châlets all huddled together as if to keep\r\nthemselves warm,--as indeed they have need; got out of winter and snow\r\nand into the valley at the little village of Obergesteln, and walked, on\r\nthe same day, through a quick succession of most retired little Swiss\r\nvillages of the humblest sort, to Brieg, on the Simplon road, near the\r\nmountain of that name, which I reached at nine o’clock in the evening,\r\nmaking a journey of forty miles, a portion through the snow, in ten\r\nhours and a half. I would like to tell you much about the upper Valais,\r\na region seldom visited by travelers, but have not time; people kind and\r\nsimple; got nothing to eat on the way except hard and dry brown bread,\r\nthat may have been baked ten days; passed the villages where avalanches\r\nhad fallen in former years and crushed many people; the scenery much\r\nmore picturesque than I expected, but was most interested in the people\r\nand their little villages; women mowing, reaping, and doing every sort\r\nof the hardest labor; all awfully afflicted with goitre, scarce a person\r\nwholly free from it; actually saw one woman with a goitre not quite as\r\nlarge as her own head certainly, but about the size of that of the child\r\nshe held in her arms, apparently a year old; saw one cretin. Stopped a\r\nfew moments at the principal auberge in the village of Viesch; found the\r\npriest with two of his parishioners playing a game of cards together. A\r\nstranger being a curiosity in that region, one person accosted me very\r\npolitely, and took me up the valley a little way to see the glacier and\r\nmountains. Reached Brieg utterly worn out, but got a good supper and\r\nbed; this being just where the famous Simplon road commences the ascent\r\nof the mountains, there are many travelers and a good hotel, though\r\ndear.\r\n\r\nRose Tuesday morning at four o’clock; my feet and legs very stiff and\r\nsore; thought of going up the Simplon road into the mountains to see\r\nsome of the galleries and bridges and get fine views, but the morning\r\nwas cloudy and I did not like to lose the time; started off down the\r\nvalley, but got on slowly and very painfully; however, walked as far as\r\nLenk, I believe about twenty-four miles, and there hired a char, which\r\ntook me on to Siou, the capital of the canton, about twenty-two miles\r\nfurther, where I slept.\r\n\r\nWednesday, rose at four, and feeling pretty stout, I started off at five\r\non foot, and though certainly in very far from the best condition for\r\nwalking, went on to Martigny to breakfast, which place I reached at half\r\npast ten, twenty-four miles according to the guide-book, but the latter\r\npart was very painful. From this place one may go to the Hospice of St.\r\nBernard in ten hours. I would have been glad to have seen so famous a\r\nplace, but as to scenery it is decidedly inferior to much I had already\r\nseen. One may go to Chamouni in nine hours, getting the superb view of\r\nMont Blanc from the summit of Col de Balme on the way. Thinking it\r\nimpossible to walk farther, I hired a mule, and a person with him, and\r\nwent up to the top of Col de Balme (five hours), passing the vale and\r\nglacier of Trient. Reached the summit at four o’clock; enjoyed a fine\r\nview of Mont Blanc and its attendant peaks from top to bottom, or rather\r\nat top and bottom, for there was a belt of cloud about the middle,--a\r\nmost superb and complete view, Mer de Glace and all.\r\n\r\nQuite satisfied without going to Chamouni, so returned to Martigny at\r\neight P.M.; another good day’s work, particularly as I walked both up\r\nand down the worst part of the road, being merciful to the beast. On my\r\ndescent obtained a splendid view of the Bernese Alps. Much aroused at\r\nlooking over the register at the hotel, where the travelers expressed\r\ntheir opinions of the different hotels on the road, praising some, and\r\nspeaking of others in terms of great reprobation; good plan. I think if\r\nthe proprietor of the hotel at Sion (a very dirty hotel) could read all\r\nthat is written in his own book he would burn it.... Lay down and slept\r\ntill midnight.\r\n\r\nThursday, took diligence at one o’clock A.M. for Villeneuve; saw the\r\nfalls of the Sallanches by moonlight; arrived at Villeneuve at half past\r\nseven, just after the morning steamboat had left for Geneva; am\r\nconfident we were delayed on purpose, to induce us to go on in the\r\ndiligence instead of the next boat. For myself I did not mind waiting\r\ntill one o’clock, that I might make myself look a little decent, though\r\nI had not the means here of improving my appearance much; as to my\r\nboots, and indeed all my habiliments, they were much in the condition of\r\nthose of the Gibeonites when they made their visit to Joshua. Wrote a\r\nlittle, went out to take a look at the Castle of Chillon, which is\r\nnear,--the building itself not remarkable, but the situation fine....\r\n\r\nTook the steamboat in the afternoon; passed Vevay, Lausanne, etc., etc.,\r\nand after traversing the whole length of this much-admired, most\r\nbeautiful lake, arrived at Geneva, just at sunset; having accomplished\r\nmy pedestrian tour (long to be remembered) in ten days (excluding the\r\nSunday)....\r\n\r\nGENEVA, 19th July.\r\n\r\nMy mornings, between eleven and four, have been constantly and fully\r\noccupied at De Candolle’s. Earlier in the morning I have spent much time\r\nwith Mr. Duby,[110] a botanist and clergyman,--one of the government\r\npastors here, and it is said almost the only one who is a pious man. I\r\nhave yet to pack up a box of my gatherings and to send to the roulage to\r\nbe forwarded to New York. I have taken lodgings, for my short stay here,\r\nwith the Wolff family, very pious and excellent people, who are pretty\r\nwell known to many persons of the same class in New York. One of the\r\ndaughters is the wife of Dr. Buck,[111] and I believe your dear mother\r\nis acquainted with her. After dinner I have sometimes made little\r\nexcursions in the neighborhood; once or twice I have been accompanied\r\nby Madame Wolff and the two daughters. They are very fond of walking,\r\nand often make long excursions on foot. The two daughters walk as fast\r\nas I can, and in fact one of them nearly tired me down the other day,\r\nwhen we were hurrying in order to watch the effect of the setting sun on\r\nMont Blanc. I have taken quite a fancy to this river, the Rhone. I made\r\nmy acquaintance with it when it was but a babbling brook; I have trudged\r\nalong with it for many a mile, until it grew to a headstrong stream, and\r\nbecame so turbulent and muddy that it was obliged to jump into the lake\r\nto wash itself clean, and when it leaves the lake it is as clear as\r\ncrystal,--emerald, I should say, for it is about that color. A few\r\nmonths ago I saw the same river in its old age, just falling into the\r\nocean. Walked back along the shore of the lake; reached the house just\r\nin time to join in the evening worship,--a sweet hymn was sung (in\r\nFrench), one of the young ladies leading with the piano and all joining\r\nwith their voices, and hearts, too, I doubt not; and then the venerable\r\nold man read a chapter, which I could understand very well, and closed\r\nwith a simple and fervent prayer. You cannot know yourself how pleasant\r\nit is, after being jolted about in the rude world for months, to get\r\nagain with a pious family. The house is just without the town,\r\nsurrounded with a large garden and fine trees and shrubbery, and all\r\nvery pleasant. Some days after, we made another excursion to visit their\r\npastor. He was not at home, so I missed him, but saw his pretty garden.\r\nOn the two Sundays I have heard one of the pastors of the Evangelical\r\nSociety preach in the morning, and the clergyman of the English chapel\r\nin the afternoon. I have also had the satisfaction of seeing Mr. Malan,\r\nwho, when he called here the other day, was so good as to hold a long\r\nand edifying religions conversation with me. He is a very apostle in\r\nappearance, and in conversation. Indeed, I have been thrown here into\r\nthe midst of religious society of a high tone and of great sweetness and\r\nsimplicity. I hope I have received some benefit from it. As I leave here\r\nI shall lose all this and shall see nothing more like it until I get\r\nhome again....\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE P. PUTNAM.\r\n\r\nBÂLE, July 23d.\r\n\r\n... I left on Saturday morning for Lausanne and Freiburg, where I heard\r\nthe big organ on Sunday; came on in the night to Berne, and yesterday to\r\nthis place over the Jura. I wished here to see Professor Meisner, but\r\nfound out this morning, some hours after the steamboat had left, that he\r\nwas absent on a journey. I was a great fool for not finding that out\r\nlast night, in which case I should now have been below Strasburg,--and\r\nthis evening at Mannheim. As it is, I can’t wait here till Thursday\r\nmorning for the next boat, and shall leave this evening for Schaffhausen\r\nand Tübingen, and thence push on, the best way I can, for Dresden and\r\nLeipsic. I do not lose a moment of time. Do not be surprised if I drop\r\nin upon you about the 4th or 5th of September. I would like to sail for\r\nhome the latter part of that month. In early winter we will hope to give\r\nyou an entire volume of “Flora,” and see what you can do with it. I have\r\nblocked out, in my mind, scientific labor enough for several years to\r\ncome, and several works some of which will be good in a publisher’s\r\nacceptance of the term; others, I dare say, not. As Murray’s fame is\r\nderived from Byron, so shall you be immortalized and known to all\r\nposterity as the publisher of the celebrated Dr. Gray!!!\r\n\r\nWe have not much time to lose, and on my arrival at London I shall be\r\nwonderfully busy. I hope you will have picked up a great quantity of\r\nbooks for me by that time. My future credit and comfort will very much\r\ndepend upon my bringing home an immense quantity of books for my\r\nmoney.... When I was in England I could scarcely hold up my head as a\r\nYankee should--what with our border wars and domestic quarrels. But now\r\nI feel greatly relieved. The recent “Birmingham affair” and several\r\nother things fortunately (?) give me “wherewith to answer them that are\r\nof the contrary part.” Let them shut their mouths now! You know my\r\naddress at Berlin, or you may address poste restante if you will. I\r\nthink I shall be there till about the 25th August. I shall stop a few\r\ndays at Hamburg. I think I may say that I shall not go up to Rostock.\r\nYou will perhaps be receiving some letters for me, which, now you know\r\nmy movements, you will act according to discretion either in forwarding\r\nto me or in retaining.\r\n\r\nI have bought scarcely any books since I left Paris. I have had some\r\ngood ones given me.\r\n\r\nExcuse this hurried epistle. I have precious little time, and I find I\r\nam growing more and more slovenly every day. Adieu.\r\n\r\nMost truly yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\n... Arrived at Geneva by way of Villeneuve and the Lake. De Candolle and\r\nAlphonse had returned only three days previous to my arrival. They\r\nreceived me very cordially, and I went through the herbarium as far as\r\nthe “Prodromus” is prepared.\r\n\r\nFrom Geneva I went to Lausanne and Freiburg; ... thence to Berne, where\r\nI made no stay; thence to Bâle, to Schaffhausen, to Tübingen, where I\r\nspent the morning with Mohl;[112] reached Stuttgart toward evening and\r\nHeidelberg the next morning. Frankfort in the evening; took the eilwagen\r\nthe same night for Leipsic; saw Pöppig,[113] Schwägrichen,[114] etc.;\r\nrailroad to Dresden; saw Reichenbach[115] for a few moments, as he went\r\ninto the country the same day; visited the picture-gallery, which\r\ndeserves to be called the richest out of Italy; returned to Leipsic; to\r\nHalle; passed a day or two with Schlechtendal;[116] saw the Carices in\r\nthe herbarium of Schkuhr;[117] Potsdam, Sans-Souci, the marble palace,\r\nthe beautiful statue of the late queen of Prussia by Rauch (the second\r\nand best one); and thence to Berlin, where I remained nearly a month;\r\nsaw the botanists, etc.\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nLONDON, September 13.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--The “penny postage system” not being yet in operation,\r\nI embrace an opportunity that offers to send you a line in Pamphlin’s\r\nparcels. I am again in London, you see; indeed I have been here about a\r\nweek. But it is only to-day that I have had intelligence of your return\r\nto Scotland. I had some hopes that I should find you in London on my\r\narrival, or that you would return here from Chatham, and that I should\r\nhave the gratification of seeing you once more. I received your welcome\r\nletter of August 14th, at Berlin, for which I thank you much. I wish my\r\nfriends at home were half as prompt correspondents. While on the\r\nContinent I have received precious few letters.\r\n\r\nI have been much interested at Berlin, and worked hard. The herbarium of\r\nWilldenow is larger and in better condition than I supposed, and the\r\ngeneral herbarium is very interesting and rich. Klotzsch[118] is very\r\nindustrious, and has got the whole collection in much better order than\r\nmost of the herbaria on the Continent. I am under great obligations to\r\nDr. Klotzsch, who not only afforded me every facility at the Herbarium,\r\nbut most cheerfully aided me in every possible way, and during a\r\ntransient illness (for I was confined to my room for a week or so, and\r\nto my bed for a few days) he procured for me the best medical advice,\r\nand took a great deal of trouble on my account.\r\n\r\nI lost some time by this, but fortunately I had nearly finished my work\r\nat the Herbarium, and afterwards I had a few days to finish, and to\r\nlook at Kunth’s[119] herbarium, with which I was rather disappointed.\r\nKunth was extremely polite and attentive to me. He is at work upon the\r\nthird volume of his “Enumeratio,” but I fear it will not be very well\r\ndone. I saw Ehrenberg[120] frequently, and Link[121] once or twice, but\r\nnearly all my time was spent at Schönberg, where the Botanic Garden and\r\nHerbarium are situated, which is nearly a half hour’s ride from the\r\ncity. The garden is much the finest in Germany, and the government\r\nannually expends very large sums upon it. The building exclusively\r\ndevoted to the herbarium is very commodious, though Klotzsch begins to\r\ncomplain that he has not sufficient room. It is so far from town that\r\nthere are no loungers there, and one may study perfectly undisturbed. I\r\nbrought a few things for you from Klotzsch and Link, which Pamphlin is\r\nto send to-morrow.\r\n\r\nHaving lost some time by illness I did not go to Rostock, a most\r\nout-of-the-world place, although I suppose I shall hereafter regret that\r\nI did not see Lamarck’s herbarium.\r\n\r\nI spent several days at Hamburg, saw Lehmann, his herbarium, and the\r\nbotanic garden; and took steamboat for London. Since my return I have\r\nbeen busily occupied in the city, completing some purchases for the\r\nMichigan University, and shall be mostly thus employed during the\r\nremainder of my stay....\r\n\r\n19th September.--I saw Dr. Richardson the day before yesterday, who\r\ninformed me that the Erebus was still lying at Chatham, and (what I was\r\nnot aware of) that I could reach Chatham in three or four hours. So I\r\narranged at once to go down and see Joseph before he started, but the\r\nnext day I learned that the vessels had dropped down from that port.\r\n\r\nI expect to sail in the Toronto from Portsmouth on the 1st October.... I\r\nhave yet very much to do. Yesterday I dined with Dr. Lindley and visited\r\nthe Garden. One wing of the conservatory is erected and nearly covered\r\nwith glass. It is entirely glass and iron, about 130 feet long, and will\r\nbe very fine.... Believe me, my very dear friend, most truly yours,\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, 5th November, 1839.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FATHER,--Through the favors of a kind Providence, my journey is\r\nsafely brought to a close. I am happy to inform you that I reached New\r\nYork last evening in the ship Toronto, after a passage of thirty-five\r\ndays. I left London on the last of September, and Portsmouth on the 1st\r\nult. The steamship Great Western, which left on the 19th of last month,\r\nreached New York two days before us! Our voyage was a rather pleasant\r\none, although we had nearly forty passengers. It was rather rough, but\r\nno very hard gales. I was sea-sick but a single day, and then but\r\nslightly. I have brought with me nearly the full amount of my purchases\r\nof books for the Michigan library, a large collection. I am waiting to\r\nhear from Detroit to know whether it will be necessary for me to go up\r\nthere this fall. I hope I shall not be obliged to make this journey\r\nuntil spring. I shall not come up to see you until I hear from Michigan,\r\nwhen I can take Sauquoit in my way if it be necessary to go to Michigan.\r\nI am now busy in getting my boxes and parcels through the custom-house,\r\nwhich is a tedious business. I hope I shall be allowed to remain here\r\nduring the winter, as I have a great deal to do here.\r\n\r\nI find here a letter from my friend Dana, of the Exploring Expedition,\r\ndated Valparaiso. He seems not very well satisfied with his situation. I\r\nhave not heard from any of you for a full year. Perhaps one of my\r\nsisters will favor me with a letter now that I am so near. Love to all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nA DECADE OF WORK AT HOME.\r\n\r\n1840-1850.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Dr. Gray’s return from Europe, the University of Michigan not yet\r\nneeding his services, he settled in New York to work on the “Flora of\r\nNorth America.”[122]\r\n\r\nIn 1841 he made his first journey to the mountains of North Carolina, of\r\nwhich he wrote an account in the “American Journal of Science” in the\r\nform of a letter to Sir William Hooker.\r\n\r\nThe country west of the Mississippi was just now opened to exploration,\r\nand for some years continued to afford an immense amount of new material\r\nto the botanist. Dr. Gray, and his friends Dr. Torrey and Dr. Engelmann\r\nespecially, interested themselves in sending collectors with the various\r\nexpeditious, explorations, boundary surveys, etc., and were kept very\r\nhard at work in studying and distributing the several collections as\r\nthey came in. The difficulties of communication were great, postage was\r\nvery dear, and the post-office rule that sheets, no matter of what size,\r\ncould be sent as one letter, while the addition of any separate\r\ninclosure was utterly forbidden, added difficulties almost\r\ninsurmountable to the transmission of any specimen. Even as late as 1850\r\nthe large parcels from St. Louis were sent by steamboat to New Orleans\r\nand then by sailing vessel to New York or Boston.\r\n\r\nForeign communication was not much better, as Dr. Gray writes to Sir\r\nWilliam Hooker in March, 1840: “I have been waiting during the winter to\r\nwrite by some of the steamships, but they have disappointed us, and,\r\nthough long expected, none reached us until the arrival of the Great\r\nWestern a week or more since, which brought us fifty-six days’ later\r\nintelligence from Europe.”\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, May 30, 1840.\r\n\r\nI have been tolerably industrious for some years, but have never labored\r\nas I have done this winter and spring. But I look now for a little\r\nrespite, which I greatly need. I have this afternoon written the\r\ndescription of the last plant we have to give in the 1st volume of the\r\n“Flora” (a new cucurbitaceous genus, of which more anon); have prepared\r\nthe last sheet for the press,--that is, of the work proper, which\r\nreaches to page 656 instead of 550, as intended; and have before me\r\nproofs of the supplement extending to page 672; what is yet to come will\r\nmake up the volume to 720 pages! It has extended beyond all calculations\r\nor bounds, but we could not stop short. I hope to have done with the\r\nproofs early next week, when I expect to go immediately into the country\r\nand recruit for three or four weeks, for I am quite fagged out. Except,\r\nhowever, mere fatigue and the usual consequences of loss of rest, I was\r\nnever, perhaps, more perfectly in health, and a fortnight or so of\r\nbotanizing will restore my strength. You kindly inquire about my plans\r\nand prospects. These are so far favorable that they will give me (D. V.)\r\nanother year of nearly undivided attention to the “Flora.” Not long\r\nsince I was officially informed that the opening of our university would\r\nbe postponed another year, on account of unfavorable times, and the\r\npreparations not being sufficiently advanced. So I am told that I can\r\nhave my time nearly all to myself until next spring (1841) if I wish\r\n(which of course I do), but without any salary, which, indeed, I could\r\nnot with any propriety take while I perform no duty. By very close\r\neconomy I think I shall get on for the year to come, and be able to\r\naccomplish a good deal of botanical work. I am going to pay the Michigan\r\npeople a visit, and if they make good their promises made to me a year\r\nago, as I have reason to think they will, their course towards me will\r\nhave been liberal and honorable. I have good reason to hope they will\r\neventually succeed in their plans.\r\n\r\nBy the London packet of the 15th of June we hope to send you and other\r\nfriends some copies of the “Flora,” parts 3 and 4. There are so many\r\nerrors, so much bad printing, and so many things that we could now do\r\nmuch better, that I regret that any portion was published before my\r\nvisit to Europe. Many of the most important corrections are given with\r\nadditions, etc., in a supplement, but I hope we shall continue to\r\nimprove as we go on. We can work to much greater advantage than before,\r\nfrom being much better supplied with books, as well as with specimens\r\nand information. Yet often do I wish to be within reach of your\r\nherbarium and library. Long accustomed to these advantages, you can\r\nscarcely appreciate the difficulties we often find. I was to-day wishing\r\nfor a look at your Cucurbitaceæ; we have, as you know, but few of the\r\norder.\r\n\r\nI shall not be able to visit Florida or any part of the Southern States\r\nthis summer; indeed, I fear I shall be debarred from any botanical\r\njourneys for some years. I must direct all my time and strength to our\r\n“Flora.” I hope we may complete another volume by the spring of next\r\nyear. The way seems to be opening for increased facilities in sending a\r\nbotanical collector to the Rocky Mountains. Our government is about to\r\nestablish a line of military outposts quite up to the source of the\r\nPlatte, in the principal pass of the mountains; and in a few years I\r\ndoubt not we shall have small colonies in Oregon; but I know not when we\r\nshall be able to send a collector. I would like vastly to go after\r\nGrayia myself, but that cannot be at present. Nuttall has been giving a\r\ncourse of botanical lectures in Boston; and still remains there, I\r\nbelieve. My attempts to find Wilson’s poem have not yet been successful.\r\nI shall esteem it a piece of good fortune if I succeed. I have engaged a\r\nfriend of mine, a bookseller, also to search for it; and when I visit\r\nPhiladelphia I shall inquire of some old people who knew Wilson. May God\r\nbless you, my dear friend; kindest, regards and affectionate sympathies\r\nto Lady Hooker.\r\n\r\nFaithfully your attached,\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO ALPHONSE DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, September 15, 1840.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND.... I had not forgotten our conversation on the subject\r\nof geographical botany. On my return I found I had a copy, a mere proof,\r\nof the little article I spoke of, and was about to offer it to you, but\r\non examination it appeared to me much less important than I had supposed\r\nand perhaps led you to expect. But as it may be of some little use, I\r\nnow beg you to accept it. I have added, here and there, the scientific\r\nnames when the popular names only were mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe question you suggest as to the effect of the destruction of the\r\nforests on the climate is very interesting, and I think still\r\nunanswered. I fear it will be next to impossible to obtain data, even in\r\nthis country, for its satisfactory determination. There are very few\r\nthermometrical observations on record of sufficient extent or exactness,\r\nexcept for the last eight or ten years. For a year or two I shall not be\r\nable to pay any attention to these subjects except to collect materials.\r\nBut I am very desirous to afford you any aid in my power, and will\r\nattend to any suggestions you make, obtain any data which come in my\r\nway, or secure the services of our botanical correspondents scattered\r\nthroughout our extended country. Pray tell me how I can aid you. The\r\nannual reports of the regents of the University of the State of New York\r\nare documents submitted annually to our legislature, and printed at\r\ntheir expense for public use. They relate chiefly to the condition of\r\nour colleges and higher schools, but for six or perhaps nine years past\r\nhave also embodied the results of the meteorological observations made\r\nthroughout the State under their instructions. The “Reports” are not on\r\nsale, and the earlier numbers are not to be obtained except by some\r\nlucky chance....\r\n\r\nThe 3d and 4th parts of our “Flora,” of which you speak so favorably,\r\nwere sent to you through Baron Delessert, as I have already apprised\r\nyou. By the time this work is completed we shall have settled somewhat\r\naccurately the geographical range of our plants, and have laid a good\r\nfoundation for the comparison of our flora with that of other regions,\r\netc. We shall soon begin to print the “Compositæ,” and I trust in early\r\nspring we may see the second volume nearly or quite completed. Pray send\r\nme sometimes loose sheets of your articles or notices (those of your\r\nfather and yourself) in the “Bibliothèque Universelle.” I will sometimes\r\ntranslate them, if you do not object, or otherwise notice them, for the\r\n“American Journal of Science and Arts.”\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, 15th January, 1841.\r\n\r\nThe dedication of the “Flora” we felt to be both a privilege and a duty;\r\nits favorable reception on your part gives us real pleasure.\r\n\r\nI hope I have not offended Link by overstating his age. I am pretty sure\r\nI was so informed by Klotzsch who ought to know. You will now and then\r\nsee some little articles or notices of mine in “Silliman’s Journal.” I\r\nprepare these notices merely to awaken and deepen the interest of our\r\nscattered botanists and lovers of plants, most of whom see that journal,\r\nand few of whom have any other means of knowing what is going on in the\r\nbotanical world. We have, however, a few promising fellows who take the\r\n“Journal of Botany” or something of the kind. Should I have anything to\r\ncommunicate of interest to any other than our local botanists, I shall\r\npublish of course under my own name. You will receive with this a little\r\nnotice of some European herbaria, which, commonplace as it must be on\r\nyour side of the water, is useful to our own people. I have been as\r\nbrief as I could, and have taken the pains to drop the first person\r\nsingular. I am not sure but I have already sent you a copy through Mr.\r\nPamphlin. Poor Rafinesque,[123] you know, perhaps, is dead; and I have\r\nattempted the somewhat ungracious task of giving some account of his\r\nbotanical writings, which I will send you when printed.\r\n\r\nI find that Townsend, Nuttall’s companion, published, while I was\r\nabroad, an account of their journey. I have never seen a copy, and am\r\ntold it is out of print; but I must try to find a copy for you. Townsend\r\nbeing poor, Nuttall waived his intention of publishing in his favor. I\r\nhave heard that Townsend wishes to make a journey as collector of birds,\r\nplants, etc. I wish he would go to the southern Rocky Mountains, and\r\ntrace them into New Spain. Nuttall has brought home the Grayia. Have you\r\never received any more of Nuttall’s plants, or has Boott? He is selling\r\nthem to different persons for ten dollars per hundred; just such\r\nspecimens as you received through Boott, or sometimes much better and\r\nmore copious ones. I have some of his Compositæ in my hands, which Webb\r\nhas ordered. He has a considerable number of Oregon and Californian\r\nCompositæ which Douglas did not get (and he failed to meet with many of\r\nDouglas’s), and others in the States; as Pyrrocoma with rays. Nuttall\r\nought to send all these to you.... I know with considerable accuracy\r\nwhat plants (Compositæ) are desiderata with you; and I will take the\r\nliberty of writing at once to Nuttall, and asking for such in your name.\r\nI shall ask for about one hundred Compositæ, and will extend the order\r\nto other plants if you desire it. He has, however, distributed nothing\r\nbeyond Compositæ. Pray let me know at once if I have done rightly in\r\nthis....\r\n\r\nAmong Drummond’s Louisiana plants is the rarest of all United States\r\nCompositæ, Stokesia cyanea. It was pointed out to me by Arnott (January,\r\n1839), but I have just examined Greene’s specimens.\r\n\r\nA. G.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, 20th May, 1841.\r\n\r\nI have diligently labored about four months at Aster, in which, as I\r\nhave after all not satisfied myself, I can scarcely hope to satisfy\r\nothers; but I do think I have laid a foundation for the student of the\r\nspecies in their wild state. We had very copious materials, but could\r\nhave done little in comparison without the aid of your collection, for\r\nwhich we cannot be too grateful. I am now occupied with Solidago, which\r\nis difficult enough, no doubt but not to be compared with Aster in this\r\nrespect, partly because there are fewer species, and the synonymy much\r\nless involved, but chiefly because there are few in cultivation.\r\n\r\nWe rejoice to hear that Joseph and the Antarctic Expedition are getting\r\non so well....\r\n\r\nNo further tidings of the steamship President! We have not until now\r\nsurrendered all hope. One of the passengers, a stranger to me, but an\r\nacquaintance of a friend of mine, had charge of a small parcel for you,\r\nconsisting chiefly of proof sheets.\r\n\r\nOctober 15, 1841.\r\n\r\nI will send by the next London packet (Quebec) and write more at\r\nleisure. I have to-day sent on board that ship a box for Pamphlin,\r\ncontaining a parcel of plants for you (all of any consequence of my\r\nsmall Carolina collection with some others). Few as they are, I trust it\r\nwill give me a pleasure I seldom can enjoy--that of adding something to\r\nyour herbarium. Mr. Brydges takes also for you the proofs of a gossiping\r\narticle on the botany of the southern Alleghanies, etc., which I have\r\ntaken the liberty to address to you, and hope it will meet your\r\napproval. I shall send you clean copies, as soon as they are printed.\r\nThe article will not appear here until the 1st of January. I send you\r\nalso some ripe seeds of Diphylleia for your garden. I have live roots in\r\nthe care of a cultivator. If they live shall send you one in the\r\nspring....\r\n\r\nI must not forget to mention that my package also comprises a set of\r\nOhio Mosses from my friend Sullivant, of whom I have often spoken, and\r\nof whom as a botanist we have high hopes, as he has an independence (for\r\nthis country), talent, and much zeal. If not too much trouble, I join\r\nwith him in requesting you to name them according to the numbers, by\r\nwhich you will do him great service, as he designs to study and collect\r\nAmerican Musci especially.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, November 30, 1841.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,--Don’t hesitate about sending me anything for fear I may\r\nalready have it. Very many plants pass through my hands while I am\r\ndescribing, but my own herbarium is not very rich; and duplicates will\r\nnot oppress me. Mr. Carey does not keep European plants except those\r\nidentical, or supposed identical, with North American species. Browne,\r\nhowever, does, and I dare say would be glad to have any you can give\r\nhim. They are the gentlemen mentioned in the “Flora.” ...\r\n\r\nEupatorium Engelmannianum, sp. nov. Am. Bor., semina misit Engelmann.\r\nCan this be it, think you? If so pray help me to it; and to anything\r\nelse you can, as I mean to give addenda et corrigenda to the Compositæ\r\nat the end of the order, if I ever get through this formidable job. No\r\nwonder seven years’ labor at them ruined De Candolle’s health. You know\r\nhe is dead? He died the 9th or 10th of September last....\r\n\r\nI send you my article in the January number of “Silliman’s Journal” with\r\na little one by Sullivant,--by mail. I am extremely busy this winter,\r\nbut I hope always to answer your letters promptly, and to attend to your\r\ndesires as well as I can, whence I beg you to continue your useful\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nMarch 30, 1842.\r\n\r\nIt is not a great while since I got all the copy ready for the number of\r\nthe “Flora” now printing,--during which I could do little else.\r\nImmediately this was done I completed an arrangement with my publishers\r\nfor preparing a handsomely got up Introduction or Text-Book of Botany,\r\nfor schools, lectures, private students (medical, etc.), which must be\r\nout on the 1st of May next. Owing to illness I have as yet written\r\nalmost nothing, and besides have to superintend all the drawings, as\r\nthey must be made by a person unacquainted with botany; and at the same\r\ntime I have to correct the proofs of about thirteen sheets yet of the\r\n“Flora,” so that I am almost distracted when I think how I am to\r\naccomplish it here, where I have to see personally to almost every\r\ndetail. But I must do it, as I hope to lay the foundation for a popular\r\nand--what is of consequence to me--a profitable work.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, 30th March, 1842.\r\n\r\nThe last steamship left Boston so soon after I received your kind letter\r\nthat I was unable to answer it by that conveyance. I intended to send\r\nthis by the Columbia steamer of the 2d prox.; but I learn that having\r\nbroken her shaft in the outward voyage she is to sail back to England;\r\nwhen it comes to canvas I have more confidence in our old liners, and\r\ntherefore send by New York packet.\r\n\r\nHave you not seen or heard of Nuttall yet? He sailed for England on\r\nChristmas last, to take possession of property left him by some deceased\r\nrelatives.\r\n\r\nI should not feel a residence in Michigan as a banishment. I am fond of\r\na country life. But at present I see almost no hopes of usefulness\r\nthere. Like all our new, and some of our old States, they have\r\nsquandered the means they once possessed and encumbered themselves\r\nalmost irretrievably with debt. On my return from Europe in the autumn\r\nof 1839, I received a letter stating that they had nothing yet for me\r\nto do, and permitting me to spend the winter in New York. In the spring\r\nof 1840, a committee of the regents wrote to me, to relinquish the\r\nprovisional salary (of fifteen hundred dollars, on which I had been\r\nplaced) for one year from that date, they relinquishing my services for\r\nthat period and allowing me to devote my time to the “Flora,” etc. I at\r\nonce accepted their proposal; but although another year has now elapsed\r\nsince the expiration of the period to which they proposed to limit this\r\nagreement, not a word have I heard officially or unofficially from\r\nMichigan. I have quietly awaited the result, ready at any moment to obey\r\ntheir call; but having no income for the last two years, I have been\r\ngreatly embarrassed, and have struggled through great difficulties, I\r\nscarcely know how. Notwithstanding, I have thought until recently that I\r\nought not to seek any other situation. I shall now write to Michigan\r\nimmediately, inquiring whether, in their present condition, they are\r\nready to fulfill their engagements with me, or whether they would prefer\r\nto accept my resignation, which I shall offer. I expect, and on the\r\nwhole hope, they will accept it.\r\n\r\nIn December, or nearly the 1st of January last, a friend of mine here,\r\nwho had some casual conversation with the President of Harvard\r\nUniversity, wished me to let my name be known as a candidate for the\r\nvacant chair of natural history there. After reflecting for a week or\r\ntwo, I wrote to B. D. Greene[124] for some information on the subject,\r\nsaying that, if freed from other engagements, I would like the botanical\r\npart of the professorship, but not the zoölogy: and that the former,\r\nwith the charge and the renovation of the Botanic Garden, would be quite\r\nenough for one.\r\n\r\nIn January I made a flying visit to Boston, where I had never been, and\r\nknew no one personally but Greene, to whom, and to Professor\r\nBigelow,[125] I expressed my views; but we none of us expected that\r\nanything would be done at present. I incidentally learned, however, not\r\nlong since, that the men of science would generally be well pleased to\r\nhave me at Boston, and that some with whom I had almost no acquaintance\r\nwere using their influence to that end. I was never more surprised,\r\nhowever, than this very evening, when I received from President Quincy\r\nan official letter, offering me the professorship provisionally, with a\r\nsmall salary, to be sure, for the present, but with only the duties of\r\nthe botanical portion.\r\n\r\nThe president states that the endowment is $30,000, yielding an income\r\nof $1,500, which, however, not being adequate to constitute a full\r\nprofessor’s salary on a permanent foundation, the corporation deem it\r\nboth their duty and the interest of the professorship to continue for a\r\nfew years, in a modified form, the policy they have hitherto pursued,\r\nand by applying one third of the income annually to the augmentation of\r\nthe capital, enable themselves to place the professor of natural\r\nhistory, at no distant period, on an equal footing with the other\r\nprofessors of the university. “To this end they propose to limit your\r\nduties, in case you are willing to accept the professorship, to\r\ninstruction and lecturing in botany, and to the superintendence\r\ngenerally of the Botanic Garden (which they wish to renovate); limiting\r\nfor the present your annual salary to one thousand dollars;” thus\r\nenabling me, as the communication proceeds to say, to devote all my time\r\nat present to my favorite pursuit, and to go on with the labors I have\r\nin hand. I have reason to hope, also, that by the time they are ready to\r\ngive me the full salary, the zoölogical part will be separated from the\r\nprofessorship, with a distinct endowment. The Botanic Garden has an\r\nendowment of $20,000. If I should take this place, I should hope to see\r\nit better endowed before long, and should immediately set about the\r\nintroduction of all the hardy trees and shrubs,--and indeed to enrich it\r\nas fast as possible with all the American and other plants that could be\r\nprocured. In that case, separated from yourself by only fourteen to\r\neighteen days’ navigation, I could hope to be a useful correspondent to\r\nyou at Kew, and to show my gratitude for your continued kindness to me.\r\nI must here conclude, by stating that the president’s letter to me is to\r\nbe deemed confidential, in case I do not accept the offer. I must\r\ntherefore beg you to consider this letter likewise confidential, until\r\nyou hear further from me, which you may expect to do as soon as anything\r\nis settled in regard to this matter. I am the less reluctant to leave\r\nNew York since our good friend Dr. Torrey is at Princeton, New Jersey\r\n(only four hours from New York), renting his house in town, where for\r\nthe present he will only remain during the winter. We have worked so\r\nlong together that I shall feel the separation greatly.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK, 30th May, 1842.\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to inform you that having accepted the offer from\r\nHarvard University of which I apprised you in my letter of April 1, I\r\nwas appointed to the professorship on the 30th of April last. The\r\nincessant occupation of this month has prevented me from writing to you\r\nsooner, and still prevents me sending anything beyond this hasty note. I\r\nhope in a week or so to have my new text-book finished, when I shall\r\nvisit Cambridge to make the necessary arrangements for my removal\r\nthither. I hope hereafter to be a useful correspondent to you, in the\r\nway of supplying you with seeds and living plants of our own country,\r\nand when I see what can be done with our Garden I shall probably ask you\r\nto aid us. I wish to visit the mountains of Carolina again, in autumn,\r\nto procure roots and seeds....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1842, as his last letter intimated, Dr. Gray was\r\nappointed to the Fisher professorship of natural history in Harvard\r\nCollege. He was then thirty-one years old. He removed to Cambridge in\r\nJuly, taking lodgings near the colleges at Deacon Munroe’s, on what is\r\nnow James Street.\r\n\r\nBefore Dr. Gray came to Cambridge he had been elected into the American\r\nAcademy (November 10, 1841). He threw himself with the greatest interest\r\ninto its work. Scarcely any winter storm kept him from its meetings; all\r\nother engagements had to give way. And when new life began in its\r\npublications, many of his most important papers appeared in its volumes.\r\n\r\nHe was also influential in establishing a scientific club consisting of\r\nmembers of the college faculty and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portrait with A Gray (handwritten)]\r\n\r\nother friends in Cambridge. Of this, too, he was a most faithful member.\r\nThe club met twice a month at the houses of the different members in\r\nturn, and the one at whose house it met was expected to bring forward\r\nsome subject, generally from his specialty, which later was discussed\r\nand criticised. Many of the new interests in science were here first\r\npresented by Dr. Gray.\r\n\r\nAmong the founders and early members were, Charles Beck, Francis Bowen,\r\nAdmiral Davis, Epes S. Dixwell, Edward Everett, President Felton, Asa\r\nGray, Simon Greenleaf, Thaddeus Mason Harris, Joseph Lovering, Benjamin\r\nPeirce, Josiah Quincy, Jared Sparks, Daniel Treadwell, James Walker,\r\nJoseph E. Worcester, the lexicographer, and Morrill Wyman, M. D. Later,\r\namong those no longer living, were added at different times Louis\r\nAgassiz, Thomas Hill, Joel Parker, Emory Washburn, and Joseph Winlock.\r\nThe club is still in existence.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nBOSTON, Monday, 25th July, 1842.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DOCTOR,--Having time before the mail closes to write a harried\r\nletter, I hasten to let you know that I have this morning secured\r\nlodgings at Cambridge, at a retired house, off the main road, about\r\nhalfway between the colleges and the Garden. For $3.00 per week, I have\r\ntwo rooms, one pretty large, one moderate (of which I shall make a\r\nbedroom), a small nearly dark bedroom which I shall shelve and use for\r\nmy herbarium, and three closets, furnished decently (but not\r\nextravagantly!!), in a house where there can at most be only one other\r\nlodger, and he must ascend by a different staircase from mine,--the\r\nrooms and bed linen, etc., to be kept in order.\r\n\r\nI am to board at an adjacent house, to which I have access by a private\r\ngate through the garden. The latter house belongs to Mrs. Peck (widow of\r\nmy predecessor), who boards there, and who I see has bestirred herself\r\nto contrive and effect this arrangement. I am to take possession next\r\nMonday. Meanwhile I am Mr. Greene’s guest here, where I have the house\r\nfor the most part to myself. I arrived here Friday morning, just in time\r\nto miss the president, who had just started for Portland, and has not\r\nyet returned. I have seen Bigelow, Emerson,[126] etc., and have been\r\nlooking about among the libraries here, and endeavoring to arrange\r\nmatters so as to procure just, and only such, books for the college as\r\nare wanting. I am pleased to find a complete copy of “Linnæa” at the\r\nlibrary of the American Academy.\r\n\r\nI passed last Sunday all alone in Greene’s house. Mr. Emerson met me\r\ncoming from Park Street Church, and on telling him that I was of\r\nOrthodox faith, he said he was very glad of it, although not altogether\r\nof that way himself.\r\n\r\nI have been only twice to Cambridge, whence I have just returned, and\r\nwhere you may address your letters. But I can do little there until the\r\npresident returns, by which time, however, I must trust to have my list\r\nof books ready. I have just written to Mr. Wiley to send on my boxes,\r\nand hope next week to get nearly in working order. I now think of\r\nremaining here (studying Compositæ, etc.) through the month of August,\r\nand then visiting Mt. Washington, if I can get money and a companion (I\r\nshall ask Oakes), and in September going (via New York?) to western New\r\nYork, where I wish to collect roots and seeds as extensively as may be.\r\nI will soon make out a list of some things I would like Knieskern to get\r\nfor me in the pine barrens.\r\n\r\nTell E., also, that I must write her about a learned lady in these\r\nparts, who assists her husband in his school, and who hears the boys’\r\nrecitations in Greek and geometry at the ironing-board, while she is\r\nsmoothing their shirts and jackets! reads German authors while she is\r\nstirring her pudding, and has a Hebrew book before her, when knitting [?\r\nnetting--A. G.]. There’s nothing like down East for learned women. Why,\r\neven the factory-girls at Lowell edit entirely a magazine, which an\r\nexcellent judge told me has many better-written articles than the “North\r\nAmerican Review.” Some of them, having fitted their brothers for college\r\nat home, come to Lowell to earn money enough to send them through!!\r\nVivent les femmes. There will be no use for men in this region,\r\npresently. Even my own occupation may soon be gone; for I am told that\r\nMrs. Ripley (the learned lady aforesaid) is the best botanist of the\r\ncountry round. But the mail is about to close; this nasty steel pen\r\nrefuses to write; dinner is ready, and so with love to all, I subscribe\r\nmyself,\r\n\r\nYours most affectionately,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 30th July, 1842.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR WILLIAM,--It is indeed a long time since I have heard from\r\nyou; although, indeed, I can well suppose that, in your new\r\nsituation,[127] you are too much occupied to write frequently to your\r\nfriends on this side of the ocean. Having finished my little “Botanical\r\nText-Book” (a copy of which is sent you through the publishers, Wiley &\r\nPutnam, who have an office in Stationer’s Court, Paternoster Row), and\r\npacked up my things at New York, I have just taken possession of my\r\nsituation at Cambridge. The Botanic Garden, which has a good location,\r\ncontains over seven acres of land, and the trees have well grown up. It\r\nalready contains some good American plants, and I shall immediately\r\ncommence a plan of operations with the view of accumulating here, as\r\nfast as possible, the phænogamous plants, etc., of the United States and\r\nCanada; and hope to supply you with such of our indigenous species as\r\nyou may desire. I wish I could know what plants are likely to be\r\nacceptable to you, that I may not send you what you already have. I must\r\npostpone to next year my contemplated visit to the mountains of\r\nCarolina, where I can make a fine collection of interesting plants for\r\ncultivation. Perhaps I can also visit Labrador next year. This autumn I\r\nmust confine myself to an excursion to the White Mountains, to the\r\nwestern part of New York, and to the pine barrens of New Jersey. I shall\r\nmost gladly share the seeds and roots I collect with you. My good friend\r\nMr. Sullivant, also promises me the living Sullivantia and many other\r\ninteresting plants.\r\n\r\nLet me also say, my dear sir, that any duplicates you can spare us from\r\nyour noble institution will be truly acceptable and in the highest\r\ndegree useful to us, as we have very few exotics and hot-house plants.\r\nWe have a good gardener, and I think I can promise you that whatever you\r\nchoose to give us shall be sedulously taken care of.\r\n\r\nDr. Torrey is now at Princeton. I had the pleasure of spending a week\r\nwith him not long since, and hope to visit him again early in the\r\nautumn. I shall miss him very much. I am here more favorably situated\r\nwith respect to books than at New York. I hope next week to begin again\r\nwith the “Flora,” and perhaps to finish the Monopetalæ.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 26th July, 1842.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DOCTOR,--I hope to get settled here, and in working order in a\r\nweek or so; to work at Compositæ, all next month, and to occupy a part\r\nof September and October in collecting the roots and seeds of plants, of\r\nthe White Mountains, of western New York, etc., for our Botanic Garden\r\nhere; which I wish to renovate, to make creditable to the country and\r\nsubservient to the advancement of our favorite science. I wish to see\r\ngrowing here all the hardy and half-hardy plants of the United States\r\n(as well as many exotics, etc.), and shall exert myself strenuously for\r\ntheir introduction. The Garden contains seven acres; the trees and\r\nshrubs are well grown up; we are free from debt, and have a small fund.\r\nThe people and the corporation are anxious that we should do something,\r\nand I trust will second our efforts.\r\n\r\nAllow me therefore to say that yourself and your friend Lindheimer[128]\r\nin Texas would render me, and also the cause of botany in this country,\r\nthe greatest aid (which I will take every opportunity of publicly\r\nacknowledging), if you will send me roots or seeds of any Western\r\nplants, especially the rarer, and those not yet figured or cultivated\r\nabroad. But nothing peculiar to the West and South will come amiss. I am\r\ncalling on all my correspondents to assist me in this matter; which, by\r\ngiving me the opportunity of examining so many living plants, will\r\nvastly increase the correctness of our “Flora.” I shall not be idle\r\nmyself. I will defray all expenses of collection and transportation\r\n(boxes may be sent via New Orleans, directly to me at Boston). If you\r\nwish to cultivate anything that I have or can procure, it shall be\r\nforthcoming. Pray let me hear from you on this subject.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 15th September, 1842.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--Your letter of the 6th inst. awaited my return from the\r\nWhite Mountains last evening, and I must drop you a hasty reply by this\r\nday’s mail. I started for the mountains almost at a moment’s warning.\r\nEmerson, who was to accompany me, being called down to Maine, wrote me\r\nunexpectedly to meet him on Monday or Tuesday of last week at the Notch.\r\nI had just time to look up Tuckerman,[129] the very morning of his\r\narrival! and to get his consent to meet me on Monday morning at the cars\r\nfor Dover. Monday evening we reached Conway, New Hampshire, thirty miles\r\nfrom the White Mountains (full in sight); and Tuesday, in a one-horse\r\nwagon, we reached and botanized up the Notch to Crawford’s at its head.\r\nEmerson had been there, and returned to his father’s in Maine, having\r\nlearned his brother’s arrival from France in the ship that brought\r\nTuckerman. We made two ascents to the higher mountains; slept out one\r\nnight; cold weather; a good deal of rain, but had some very fine weather\r\nfor views. We saw the ocean distinctly, which is only possible under\r\nfavorable circumstances. I made a fine collection of living plants,\r\nwhich was the chief object. Although too late for botanizing, yet I got\r\nmany good alpines in fruit, some few in flower. When I see you, which I\r\ntrust will be soon, I will tell you particulars, and bring specimens of\r\nthe few plants collected that will be needed in your herbarium.\r\n\r\nI have seen the president this morning, and find that Mr. Lowell has\r\nreturned, but all are so busy that I doubt if they will settle anything\r\nabout our affairs until the last of next week. Consequently I shall be\r\nkept here all next week. I shall immediately, at Mr. Quincy’s desire, or\r\nrather approval of my intimation, draw up a plan of my wishes for the\r\nmanagement of the Garden, and shall ask for a specific appropriation, of\r\nsmall amount, for obtaining live plants, paying bills of transportation,\r\netc. If I succeed, I may then be able to engage Knieskern to procure\r\nsome New Jersey plants, as well as go to western New York myself; but I\r\nfear this delay, with the advancing season, will perhaps prevent the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nSaturday afternoon, 5th December, 1842.\r\n\r\nThe parcel of Compositæ, etc., of the Far West has only just come in. I\r\nhave looked over the Compositæ with some excitement. Some few new and\r\nthe old help out Nuttall’s scraps, etc., very well. Tetradymias this\r\nside of the Rocky Mountains!! Some new Senecios, especially, from the\r\nmountains, near the snow line. How I would like to botanize up\r\nthere!...\r\n\r\nI wish we had a collector to go with Frémont. It is a great chance. If\r\nnone are to be had, Lieutenant F. must be indoctrinated, and taught to\r\ncollect both dried specimens and seeds. Tell him he shall be\r\nimmortalized by having the 999th Senecio called S. Fremontii; that’s\r\n_poz._, for he has at least two new ones....\r\n\r\nI have the privilege of expending one hundred dollars in botanical\r\nillustrations,--to be the property of the college and to be increased\r\nfrom time to time. How do you advise me to proceed in the matter?\r\n\r\nThough greatly behindhand, I must get Compositæ all done this month.\r\nThen if you could have the Lobelias and Campanulas ready, I think we\r\ncould print the latter part of January, and I get everything off my mind\r\nand ready for teaching 1st of March....\r\n\r\nThis letter you see has no beginning, as I have scribbled down memoranda\r\nfor a day or two past, as they occurred to me. I am deep among Thistles,\r\nwhich are thorny (though I see that they are satisfactionable, all but\r\none little group of two or three species), and have been considerably\r\ninterrupted, or I should have written you sooner.\r\n\r\nTO MRS. TORREY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, Wednesday evening, December 14, 1842.\r\n\r\nIt is some time since I have written to Princeton, and longer since I\r\nhave heard from any of you; for I believe you are every one in my debt.\r\nThis, however, has not restrained me from writing, and I have only\r\nwaited until a proposition very unexpectedly made me a few days ago\r\nshould be disposed of. I have been invited to lecture before the Lowell\r\nInstitute next year, and have had the hardihood to accept! A celebrated\r\nlawyer here says that he never hesitates to take any case that offers,\r\nto be argued six months hence! I have taken this in much the same way.\r\nBut when the time draws near I dare say I shall call myself a very great\r\nfool. But it is now neck or nothing. The money will be really very\r\nuseful to me; to decline the offer, coming from one of the most\r\ninfluential of the corporation of the college, would have had an\r\nunfavorable effect on my prospects, which moderate success will greatly\r\nadvance. The pay is $1,000 for twelve lectures, or $1,200 if they are\r\nrepeated in the afternoons. Instead of the latter, I have proposed to\r\ngive a collateral, more scientific course of about twenty lectures, with\r\na small ticket-fee to render the audience more select, and for which I\r\nshould get about $500, making $1,500 in all. The Institute will pay for\r\nfull illustrations. Mr. Lowell offered at once to engage me for two or\r\nthree years; but I told him he had best wait to see how I succeeded. Mr.\r\nLowell told me that he was in treaty with two of the most distinguished\r\northodox divines in this country for courses on Natural Theology and the\r\nEvidences of Christianity; the one to commence next year, the other the\r\nyear after. I do not doubt one is President Wayland. Who can the other\r\nbe? Tell Dr. Torrey he hopes to get Faraday next year; and Mr. Owen the\r\nyear after.\r\n\r\nI should not wonder if my appointment were in some degree owing to a\r\nlittle piece of generosity in a small way that I played off not long\r\nsince. The president has once or twice asked me to hear the Freshmen\r\nnext term in a course of recitations from a text-book on general natural\r\nhistory as a matter of favor, as he did not wish Mr. Harris or any one\r\nelse to perform this duty; and offering me, of course, additional\r\ncompensation, I suppose $200 or so. I found, however, that this pay\r\nwould come from the funds of the Garden, let who would perform the duty.\r\nSo to prevent that, I offered to perform the duty, but to receive no pay\r\nfor it. At the same time, however, I got the corporation to appropriate\r\n$100 for illustrative botanical drawings, which otherwise would have\r\ncome out of my own pocket. So you see I have work enough ahead, if I\r\nlive, to give me both occupation and anxiety. I have been driving away\r\nat the “Flora,” of late, very hard, hoping to come to New York to print\r\nnext month; when all this matter must be laid aside, and I must prepare\r\nfor my lectures, etc., for next term, which commences about the first of\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\nI am very tired, having been in Boston all day,--at tea at Mr. Albro’s,\r\nour good pastor, where I met Mr. Dana, father of “Two Years before the\r\nMast” Dana, and passed the rest of the evening at Professor\r\nPeirce’s.[130] To-morrow I hope to have for study; but the next day I\r\nshall be obliged to go again to Boston, and perhaps stay till evening\r\nfor a soirée at Mr. Ticknor’s.\r\n\r\nThe Latimer case has greatly increased the abolition feeling in this\r\nState, besides showing that the recent decision of the Supreme Court\r\nwill in fact operate in favor of the runaway slave. It is not probable\r\nthat another slave will ever be again captured in Massachusetts. There\r\nis a petition to Congress in circulation, designed simply to express the\r\nfeelings of Massachusetts, which will probably be signed by almost every\r\nperson in the State.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 3, 1843.\r\n\r\nYour letter, truly welcome after so long an interval, reached me\r\nyesterday. I should have been very glad to be with you during the\r\nholidays, but cannot think of leaving before I finish these interminable\r\nCompositæ. I hoped to have accomplished this on Saturday last; all but\r\ntaking up some dropped stitches; but was a good deal interrupted last\r\nweek. The December number of “Annals and Magazine of Natural History”\r\n(of which Professor Balfour is the botanical editor) contains a very\r\ncomplimentary notice of the “Botanical Text-Book,” accompanied with a\r\nfew judicious selections, which shows that the writer has looked it over\r\ncarefully; and winds up by terming it the best elementary treatise (as\r\nto structural botany) in the English language. So easy is it to get\r\npraise where it is not particularly deserved!...\r\n\r\nMy great object for next year is to attempt to raise $10,000 from some\r\nof our rich men, to rebuild our greenhouse on a larger and handsome\r\nscale. There are a few men, who have never given anything to the\r\ncollege, who may perhaps be induced to give for this object.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, MASS., February 13, 1843.\r\n\r\nI note with interest what you propose in regard to Lindheimer’s\r\ncollections for sale in Centuriæ, fall into your plans, and will\r\nadvertise in “Silliman’s Journal” (and in “London Journal of Botany”)\r\nwhen all is arranged. Pray let him get roots and seeds for me. I will do\r\nall I can for him. But if the Oregon bill passes, a party under\r\nLieutenant Frémont, or some one else, will go through the Rocky\r\nMountains to Oregon; and parties of emigrants or explorers will go also.\r\nNow why not send Lindheimer in some of these? Probably the government\r\nparty would afford him protection, and probably he might be formally\r\nattached to the party. Frémont will not take Geyer;[131] but I believe\r\nhe wants some one. The interesting region (the most so in the world) is\r\nthe high Rocky Mountains about the sources of the Platte, and thence\r\nsouth. I will warrant ten dollars per hundred for every decent specimen.\r\nIf he collects in Texas, eight dollars per hundred is enough. I write in\r\nhaste, hoping this plan may strike you favorably and be found\r\npracticable. Let me know at once. The opportunity should not be lost. Do\r\nsend Lindheimer to the Rocky Mountains if possible.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, February 28, 1843.\r\n\r\nI found your most welcome letter on my return from New York a few weeks\r\nsince, and have since sent it to Dr. Torrey, who was equally delighted\r\nwith myself at the opportunity of hearing from you.\r\n\r\nOur term opens to-day, and I am just on the point of commencing my\r\ncourse of botanical lectures, which is rather formidable to a beginner.\r\nSo you will excuse my hasty letter. I would not miss to-morrow’s\r\nsteamer, as I wish to say that your offer to furnish our Garden--the\r\ngreat object of my care--with hardy plants from your rich stores at Kew\r\ndelights me much. I have only to say that everything you can send will\r\nbe truly welcome. Our stock of European hardy plants (whether herbs or\r\nshrubs) is small, and consists of the commonest and oldest-fashioned\r\nthings in cultivation. These, and every Californian, Oregon, and Texan\r\nplant of which you have duplicates to spare us (or seeds), whether hardy\r\nor not,--these are the plants I am just now most desirous to accumulate.\r\nGreenhouse plants are scarcely less welcome, but of those I will write\r\nmore particularly hereafter. Can you send us a young Araucaria imbricata\r\nand Stuartia pentagyna?\r\n\r\nMy plans for accumulating American plants were put in operation too late\r\nlast autumn to give us much as yet, but my correspondents throughout the\r\ncountry seem interested in the matter; some will reach me this spring,\r\nand still more, I trust, in the autumn. With regard to all these, as\r\nsoon as I see them growing, so that I can send them with authentic\r\nnames, I shall most gladly share with you.... I shall continue to direct\r\nall my energies to the advancement of our amiable science in this\r\ncountry, not, I trust, in vain. I have a plan to publish, from time to\r\ntime, figures of rare or interesting North American plants, chiefly\r\nthose cultivated in our Garden and those upon which I may throw some\r\nlight. I think there are persons enough here interested in the matter,\r\nincluding gentlemen of public spirit here, who would encourage it for\r\nthe Garden’s sake, to nearly defray the expense, which is all I desire\r\nor expect....\r\n\r\nWhat a charming place you must be making of Kew! What a field for the\r\nbotanist!\r\n\r\nTO MRS. TORREY.\r\n\r\nThursday evening, 2d March, 1843.\r\n\r\nYou will be anxious to hear how my first lecture succeeded, knowing it\r\nwas to have been given to-day.[132] But you must wait a week longer.\r\nSince my last letter was dispatched the president, finding the class\r\nwould hardly be ready, desired me merely to meet them to-day for the\r\npurpose of pointing out the subject in the “Text-Book,” arranging\r\ngeneral plan and all that, postponing my lecture to Thursday of next\r\nweek. This I was most ready to do, as it gave me the opportunity of\r\nentering by degrees upon my task, feeling my way instead of making a\r\nplunge in regular desperation. The great thing is self-possession. The\r\nmoment I get that I shall feel tolerably safe. So I met my class to-day,\r\narranged matters, and made a few remarks without stammering a bit, so\r\nfar as I recollect, or speaking much too fast. My class consists of\r\nabout two dozen students (undergraduates), mostly Seniors, besides which\r\nany law or divinity students and resident graduates who choose can\r\nattend, and several probably will. For my recitations in natural history\r\ngenerally, I have divided the Freshmen into four sections, about sixteen\r\nin each, two of which I meet on Fridays, and two on Tuesdays; have given\r\nthem their lessons, and to-morrow, consequently, I commence these\r\nrecitations. I must not forget to tell you that since my return the\r\nSunday-school class left by one of our people who has removed to Boston\r\nhas been given me, a class of eight or nine very intelligent misses,\r\nvarying from sixteen years old to twelve, all of one family, though\r\noriginally of three, some being sister’s children (orphans, etc.). I am\r\ngreatly pleased with them, delighted with their docility and\r\nintelligence, and anticipate a very happy time. So you see I have three\r\nsets of scholars, on different subjects. I ought to be “apt to teach.”\r\n\r\nSaturday morning.--I must dispatch my letter by to-day’s mail, and as I\r\nam going to Boston, where I have not been for a week, I will drop it in\r\nthe post office there, to insure its transmission by this afternoon’s\r\nmail. Yesterday afternoon I met the first two sections of my class of\r\nFreshmen for recitation. It went off very well. I am pretty good at\r\nasking questions. The lads were well prepared. Next Tuesday I meet the\r\nthird and fourth sections; and on Thursday, the ides of March, I give my\r\nfirst lecture on Botany. If I succeed well, I am sure no one will be\r\nmore pleased and gratified than yourself, and that of itself is enough\r\nto incite me to effort. If I don’t altogether succeed, neither\r\nsatisfying myself nor others, I shall not be discouraged, but try again,\r\nas I am determined to succeed in the long run. Nil desperandum. I shall\r\nhave the president to hear me; but he is said always to fall asleep on\r\nsuch occasions, and to be very commendatory when he awakes.\r\n\r\nI now board with the sister of my landlord, Deacon Munroe, a table of\r\nonly five, one professor, one tutor, and two advanced law students. We\r\nyesterday commenced the experiment of dining at five o’clock, much to my\r\ngratification, and if the other gentlemen like it as well as I do, we\r\nshall continue to dine at that hour, until summer at least. It is very\r\ncold here; though the sun shines brightly all day, it scarcely thaws at\r\nmidday.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 18, 1843.\r\n\r\nYour most welcome and long-expected letter of the 14th reached me only\r\nthis noon. This first day of leisure of this week has been a very busy\r\none. I have been to town, and just got back. I have had to work very\r\nhard this week. I have got my course of recitations for the Freshmen on\r\nSmellie well in progress, and am quite interested in it, though at first\r\nI thought it would have been a great bore. The class are generally very\r\nmuch interested, and give promise that I shall reap the fruits of my\r\nlabor when they become Sophomores or Seniors and attend the botanical\r\nlectures, for which I think I am laying a foundation. I am now perfectly\r\nat ease in my mode of teaching them; I am pretty good at questioning,\r\nand I give them plenty of illustration, explanation, and ideas not in\r\nthe book, which pleases and interests them. In one of the divisions last\r\nweek, while giving them a sort of lecture, two hours long! (to which\r\nthey listened well; for I gave them, or those who chose, the opportunity\r\nof going at the expiration of the regular hour, but not one of them\r\nbudged), turning my head at a fortunate moment, I caught one of the\r\nfellows (rather a stupid fellow, a boarder with me last term) throwing\r\nhis cap to his companion or playing some trick. You know I can scold. So\r\nI gave him about half a dozen words that made him open his eyes wide;\r\nand I do not think that he, nor any of that division, will venture upon\r\nanything of the kind again very soon.\r\n\r\nAs to the botanical class, which now numbers thirty-seven, I have given\r\ntwo more lectures, for I lectured both Thursday and Friday, on the last\r\noccasion, which was a sort of recapitulation quite without notes, as a\r\ntrial. I am convinced that for lectures with much illustration I must\r\nhave only heads and leading ideas written; for others, I will write\r\nnearly in full. I saw Miss Lowell ... the day before my first lecture,\r\nand promised to call upon her very soon if I succeeded well. Meeting her\r\nthe other evening at Professor Sparks’s, she reproved me for not keeping\r\nmy word. I very honestly and sincerely replied that I had not succeeded\r\nwell, and was waiting until I was better satisfied. Quite to my\r\nsurprise, I found that the class, at least those she had seen, her\r\ngreat-nephew and others, were well pleased with it. I will not repeat\r\ntheir expressions, as retailed to me by Miss Lowell, because I cannot\r\nbut suspect that young Lowell may have been trying to humbug her. I feel\r\nI have so far acquitted myself very poorly as a lecturer; but I am\r\nsustained by the firm conviction that I shall in the end do very well,\r\nfor a common college class.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nMay, 1843.\r\n\r\nI have been speaking about the bones of the Zygodon, and there is a\r\ndisposition to get up a subscription in the Natural History Society and\r\nbuy them, if still for sale, the price not too great, and if Dr. Wyman,\r\non seeing them, recommends the purchase. Do you know the price? And\r\nwhether they can still be seen in New York, at Carey’s storehouse? The\r\nBoston zoölogists are far from praising De Kay’s Report. I heard\r\nSilliman on electro-magnetism the other evening (which hardly belongs to\r\nchemistry): great show of experiments; lauded Henry finely. He is\r\nfinishing off with galvanic deflagration. Will Frémont go west this\r\nyear? So Mr. Carey is going to Buffalo. Occupation will be the best\r\nthing for him; but we shall miss him in New York....\r\n\r\nMonday afternoon, 9th May.\r\n\r\nI have a few of Frémont’s plants up from seeds. The two pine-trees and\r\nthe Pyxidanthera were received in good condition, to my great\r\nwonderment. Pyxidanthera is in full bloom, and a drawing of it nearly\r\nfinished (as well as of Oakesia, about which I have some new matters\r\nthat are curious) by the eldest Miss Quincy, whom I have pressed into\r\nthe service....\r\n\r\nRhododendron Lapponicum, from the White Mountains, is just bursting into\r\nflower. I am building rock-work, but we get on slowly. All the work of\r\nthe Garden comes together this spring, and all in a heap.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 30th May, 1843.\r\n\r\n... The community here are very liberal and public-spirited. They have\r\njust given by subscription $25,000 for a telescope, etc., for our\r\nobservatory. The college have given me the use of seven or eight acres\r\nof land lying around the observatory, finely situated and diagonally\r\nopposite the Botanic Garden, as an addition.[133]\r\n\r\nAs soon as our garden begins to increase and prosper, I hope in a year\r\nfrom this we shall attempt (and doubtless succeed) in raising the funds\r\nfor a new conservatory, hot-house, etc.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 22d June, 1843.\r\n\r\nWhen you get sufficient collections from any of these botanists for\r\ndistribution, you will please forward me a set, with your own critical\r\nremarks. Although I excessively dislike to study special collections far\r\nahead of my work, yet in these cases it will be important, and I will\r\nconsent to do it. If I thus join in the responsibility and labor, which\r\nwill be great to a person with his hands so full as mine, the articles\r\nwritten on the subject and the new species must bear our joint names.\r\n\r\nYou cannot have failed to perceive that the genus Astragalus is not well\r\ndone in the “Flora.” ...\r\n\r\nI agree with you generally in the impropriety of too much multiplying\r\nnames of species after the collectors, etc., yet I think these are good\r\nnames, easily remembered, and particularly advisable in very large\r\ngenera. My practical rule is to name such species after the discoverer,\r\netc., if I cannot find any really pertinent characteristic name\r\nunoccupied....\r\n\r\nThere is much to be done, and so little time that I often wish I could\r\ndivide myself into a dozen men, and thus get on faster. Let us, however,\r\ntake particular pains to do everything thoroughly as far as we go.\r\n\r\nTO MRS. TORREY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, July 22, 1843.\r\n\r\nI find Cambridge, in vacation, as quiet as possible,--most people away.\r\nThe president’s family were at home, and unaffectedly glad to see me;\r\nbut several of them, including Miss Susan, who makes drawings for me,\r\nare about to set out on Monday for Lake Champlain, Montreal, and Quebec;\r\nto be absent nearly to the time that I hope to leave here again; for I\r\nfind, from the way the president takes it up, that I shall have no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining the sanction of the corporation to my proposed\r\nmountain tour. But of that I shall know certainly in a day or two. In\r\nthat case I shall hope to see you again in the latter part of August,\r\nperhaps as soon as the middle....\r\n\r\nDr.---- came here the day I returned. He still garnishes, as ever, his\r\nlack of ideas with a deliberate profundity of words.\r\n\r\nI found on my return a letter from my brother, announcing the\r\napproaching marriage of my youngest sister; which event took place, I\r\nsuppose, on the 20th inst., the day I left New York. Had I received the\r\nletter in New York, I should have arranged to be present on the\r\noccasion. I wonder if my turn will ever come!\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 11th August, 1843.\r\n\r\nI leave home this afternoon for New York, on my way to the Alleghany\r\nMountains in the north of Virginia, where I expect to meet my excellent\r\nfriend Mr. Sullivant, of Ohio. We hope to trace the more westerly ranges\r\nof the mountains down to North Carolina and Tennessee, to revisit my old\r\nground in Ashe County, etc., and to continue our journey farther south\r\ninto Georgia, coming out at Augusta on the Savannah River; thence I may\r\ngo to Charleston and return by water. But if time allows I shall perhaps\r\nrun through upper Georgia and Alabama, to the Tennessee River, down that\r\nto the Ohio, and thence home. My chief object is to obtain live plants\r\nand seeds; we shall be too late in the season for the best botanizing,\r\nyet I think we shall be in the best time for Compositæ. Mr. Sullivant\r\nwill turn his attention primarily to the Musci; but we shall let nothing\r\nescape. Thus at last I may hope to be somewhat useful to you as a\r\ncorrespondent for your Garden.\r\n\r\nI learn within a few days that Ross’s expedition has been heard of from\r\nRio. Doubtless Joseph will have reached home before this letter arrives,\r\nand I may congratulate him--and yourself--upon his most gratifying\r\nsuccess, which has laid a broad and sure foundation for his scientific\r\neminence. His Flora Antarctica must be of the very highest interest and\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nASHEVILLE, Saturday, September 30th, 1843.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--Your two letters which awaited my arrival--the one at\r\nJefferson, the other at Asheville--were indeed refreshing. Our long\r\njourney through Virginia brought us behind our estimated time, and\r\nhurried the later and more interesting part of our operations; for\r\nSullivant was getting very impatient, as I wrote in my last, just as we\r\nwere hurrying away from Jefferson.\r\n\r\nI doubt if I got anything of much interest in Virginia, except Buckley’s\r\n(and Nuttall’s) Andromeda, Rhamnus parvifolius on the waters of\r\nGreen-brier, (where did Pursh get it?), Heuchera pubescens in fruit and\r\nHeuehera hispida Pursh!! out of flower and fruit, so that I detected it\r\nby the leaves only (and got good roots), not far from where Pursh\r\ndiscovered it, but more west, on the frontiers of a range of mountains\r\nwhere this very local species doubtless abounds.\r\n\r\nFrom Jefferson went to Grandfather; had a fine time and good weather;\r\nexplored the old fellow thoroughly, but found 140 new Phænogams.\r\nSullivant made a great haul of Mosses and Jungermanniæ. Found the Moodys\r\nheartily glad to see us. The elder brother is married since our former\r\nvisit. Miss Nancy delighted with the calico dress I brought her, and\r\nmade me promise to ask some of my lady friends at home to cut out a\r\npattern for her in newspaper and send by mail,--to be in tiptop\r\nstyle,--in the very height of the fashion! Poor Miss Nancy! How she\r\nwould look! The “old gentleman” (Mr. Carey) was most affectionately\r\ninquired after. Indeed Miss Nancy is perfectly in love with him, and\r\nsacredly keeps the sperm-candle-end he gave her as a relic. She gave me\r\na most amusing account of the wonderment which our visit caused. To it\r\nshe attributes the advantages they now enjoy both for religious and\r\nsecular instruction. For we found a young Episcopal clergyman, sent by\r\nthe bishop, resident in the neighborhood, where he has spent already\r\nalmost a year,--a perfect hermit, so far as civilized society goes. Yet\r\nhe is busily occupied, and nearly contented, has built a little cabin in\r\nfull view of the Gothic Grandfather, and I hope is doing much good. He\r\naccompanied us to the mountain, but did not remain over night in our\r\nencampment, having a distant service on Saturday. His name is Prout.\r\nMrs. Torrey will remember something about his history, which will in\r\npart account for his willingness to spend a few years in this solitary\r\nregion. I had hoped to hear him preach on the Sunday we passed at the\r\nMoodys’ on our return from the mountain; but he preached at a station\r\nten miles off.\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn one of his later mountain journeys Dr. Gray passed again through Val\r\nCrucis in June, 1879; and the following extract from Mrs. Gray’s journal\r\ngives the sad fate of the little mission colony.\r\n\r\n“In the afternoon we came upon Val Crucis.... It seems, years ago (in\r\n1841) when Dr. Gray, Mr. John Carey, and others came exploring in the\r\nmountains, Mr. Carey was laid up for a while in a farm-house, and\r\ntalking with the good people found them woefully ignorant, especially of\r\neverything relating to Christianity. So when he went back to New York he\r\ncorresponded with the Southern bishop, who bestirred himself, and a\r\nmission was sent into the mountains. They settled at Val Crucis, and so\r\nnamed it. It was in the early days of Ritualism, and the young men\r\nthought to found something like the early monastic settlements in\r\nEngland, and as it seemed to the ignorant people, played strange pranks\r\nand preached wonderful and incomprehensible doctrines which puzzled and\r\nbewildered them; then Bishop Ives went over to the Catholic Church, and\r\nit all died out; and here is the church (the rude timber church), with\r\nstill a few members, but all the farms and settlements passed into other\r\nhands--as far as I could make out into the hands of a rich old man, who\r\nlives anything but a holy life, and whose boarding-house for the\r\nsaw-mill hands in Val Crucis is an awful degradation! I saw at the\r\nDuggers a large old Bible, and on it printed ‘Society of the Holy Cross,\r\nVal Crucis,’ which the children were using to paste stories and pictures\r\nin!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe journal continues:--\r\n\r\nMonday and Tuesday.--Crossed the Blue Ridge, descended John’s River,\r\nand went to near the base of Table Mountain. Wednesday, ascended it. Was\r\nfortunate enough to get Hudsonia montana, specimens and roots; also a\r\nfew roots of Thermopsis fraxinifolia. While digging one of these near\r\nthe base of the mountain, struck upon a little clump of Schweinitzia,\r\nhalf buried in the leaves, five or six specimens; but a long hunt\r\nfurnished no more.\r\n\r\nThursday, crossed Linville River in sight of the North Cove (Michaux’s\r\nold residence) and went to Carson’s on the Catawba. We lost a shoe from\r\nour black horse while descending the Blue Ridge, and he wore his hoof so\r\nas to lame him severely. Obliged to leave him at Carson’s (as we could\r\nnot exchange him to advantage) and hire another horse to take his place\r\nfor a week. Crossed the Swananoa gap; got fine near view of Black\r\nMountain; passed the night not far from its base (twelve miles from\r\nAsheville). Should have ascended, but could not do it so as to get back\r\nSaturday night to any place to stay, and longed to spend one Sunday in a\r\ncivilized place where we could attend public worship. So went on to\r\nAsheville to dinner; passed Saturday afternoon in taking care of our\r\nplants. Heard very good preaching at the Methodist church on Sunday.\r\nMonday set out down the French Broad. Tuesday reached the Warm Springs;\r\ngot a luxurious bath. Rode the afternoon through the rain to Paint Rock,\r\netc.; stayed the night in Tennessee below. Got Buckleya in fruit, and\r\nother things I can’t now specify. Wednesday, dug up Buckleyas, etc. Left\r\nMr. Sullivant at Warm Springs, who, not being able to bear the absence\r\nfrom his wife and children longer, has left me alone with the team, and\r\nis by this time more than halfway to Columbus. Thursday, returned to\r\nAsheville. Friday, packed a fine box of roots, with which my wagon was\r\nloaded. Sent for my black horse. Saturday, bad weather; but made a\r\nlittle excursion on horseback, got roots of Arum quinatum, which, by the\r\nway, often has the lateral leaflets not at all incised, and then (in\r\nfruit) looks just like A. Virginicum. Buckley is often inquired after\r\nhere, and seems to have been quite a favorite. He might have enlivened\r\nhis journal had he informed us therein that he visited both Black and\r\nBald Mountains with a merry company of ladies, and camped out on the\r\nsummit! But the sly fellow kept all this to himself.\r\n\r\nI begin to be in a hurry; but have yet much to do, and find it rather\r\nlonely. Monday and Tuesday I intend to devote to Hickory-Nut Gap,\r\ntwenty-eight miles and back. Then visit Black, if I meddle with this\r\nmountain at all. Then, taking final leave of Asheville, go into the\r\nmountains near the head of French Broad, take up my quarters with a\r\nwell-known hunter, try to reach Pilot and other high mountains which\r\nBuckley failed in reaching, and which have never been visited by a\r\nbotanist, unless by Rugel;[134] thence to Table Rock, South Carolina,\r\nand by a roundabout way to Franklin, Macon County, Tolula Falls, and\r\nClarksville, Georgia, where I shall try to sell out my horses and wagon,\r\nand take stage for Athens, where I am in the way to come by steam all\r\nthe way to Princeton, via Augusta and Charleston, which bid fair to be\r\nhealthy enough to warrant my passing through them without rashness.\r\n\r\nIt will be the 20th October ere I can hope to take you by the hand.\r\nTruly welcome are the newspapers you have kindly sent; but I hope for\r\nmore by the next mail, for I have none later than the middle of\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\nI never have been so hurried, and had so little time to write, but shall\r\nhave the more to tell when I reach you, if it please Providence. Excuse\r\nchirography also, for pen and ink are wretched and my hands sore.\r\n\r\nAster Curtisii abounds and is very showy. A. Elliottii takes here the\r\nplace of A. puniceus. I have found A. mirabilis.\r\n\r\nLove to all, most warmly. Don’t fail to mention me to dear Herbert.\r\n\r\nMonday morning.--Off for Hickory-Nut Gap, where the scenery is said to\r\nbe very grand, and the botanizing good. I am to get there Asplenium\r\npinnatifidum, Stuartia pentagyna, and Parnassia asarifolia. Hard work,\r\nyet pleasant with a companion. I wish you could be with me.\r\n\r\nVery pleasant Sunday service in the Presbyterian church here.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, November 4, 1843.\r\n\r\nI have been absent in the mountains of Virginia and Carolina--after live\r\nplants--from 11th August to yesterday; which will be my excuse for not\r\nreplying to your letter of September 15th. I hope in the mean time you\r\nhave found some way to send the roots you proposed. There are now\r\nconnected express lines all the way through. L. & P. Franciscus &\r\nCompany, No. 90 North Main St., St. Louis, are the agents of Brown &\r\nCompany Express, Philadelphia; this connects with Harnden’s Express to\r\nBoston, the speediest and cheapest method of sending when the package or\r\nbox is not large, and speed is desirable....\r\n\r\nGaura Lindheimeri is a very fine plant, and flowered fully three months\r\nin our Garden. I am having a drawing--hoping to publish it sometime. I\r\nwant more seeds of Œnothera rhombipetala. Ours flowered while I was\r\naway, and was killed by the frost, so that I secured no drawing. Send me\r\nall the seeds you can.\r\n\r\nInquire about the express to the East. We must somehow have the means of\r\na more speedy and regular communication of parcels.\r\n\r\nI found what I believe is your Lepidanche adpressa at Harper’s Ferry,\r\nVirginia. Also some others in the mountains, which, with a few other\r\nplants, I will send to you by express soon....\r\n\r\nYou know I am obliged now to prepare for a terrible course of public\r\nlectures, to commence in February, so that I cannot work at the “Flora”\r\nuntil spring. But I will find time to study and revise any sets of\r\nLindheimer’s, Geyer’s, and Lüder’s plants you send....\r\n\r\nAs to my paper on Ceratophyllaceæ, I have long since wished it\r\nunpublished, as it contains mistaken views. So I do not care to\r\ndistribute it.\r\n\r\nFebruary 2, 1844.\r\n\r\nI have saved Gaura Lindheimeri by cuttings put in pots last autumn. We\r\nshall have it in flower early in the spring, and then shall exhibit it\r\nat the Horticultural Society’s rooms in Boston.\r\n\r\nTO HIS FATHER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, November 18, 1843.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FATHER,--The return of my birthday brings to mind, among other\r\nshortcomings, that I have neglected to write home since my return. I\r\nhave been very busy, of course, since the 3d of the month, when I\r\nreached Cambridge, in answering the heap of letters that had\r\naccumulated, and in other business. And I have but just found time to\r\ncommence the preparation of my course of lectures before the Lowell\r\nInstitute, which is to commence on the 27th of February, and which will\r\ngive me plenty of labor and anxiety until they are over....\r\n\r\nI have laid in a good stock of health and strength for the labors of the\r\nwinter--which I am like to need, for I have a great deal to do. Another\r\nyear, if our lives are spared, I trust you will make me a visit here. I\r\nhave just given notice that I shall wish to take possession of the\r\nBotanic Garden house (now rented to one of the professors) next autumn,\r\nwhere, if I can get a room or two furnished, I shall have a place to\r\nentertain you. Affectionate regards to mother and all the family.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, February 17.\r\n\r\nMy time of trial draws near. A week from Tuesday I begin. There has been\r\na pretty brisk application for tickets. But I have yet very much to do.\r\nMy two last lectures are not even blocked out upon paper. Many pictures\r\nare yet to be made, and I shall have a busy time indeed until they are\r\nall delivered. The end will be deliverance indeed. Yet strange as it may\r\nseem, my spirits are rather on the rise; though I will not answer for\r\nthem for ten days longer.\r\n\r\nI have written an introductory which, with a few more touches, I shall\r\nbe satisfied with. And some of my lectures which have least\r\nillustrations--such as that on food and nutrition--are pretty carefully\r\nwritten out. I have contrived a diagram illustrating the cycle of\r\nrelations of three kingdoms, which I think is capital (as it is quite\r\noriginal), and which I long to show you. If I had three mouths more, I\r\nam convinced I could put my materials into the form of a capital course\r\nof lectures.\r\n\r\nZuccarini wrote me a year ago--when he sent the Japanese plants that we\r\nlooked over together--that the Japanese species utterly confounded the\r\ndifference between Rhododendron and Azalea; decandrous species having\r\ndeciduous leaves, etc. If they must come together (and De Candolle seems\r\ndoubtful) it would be a pity you did not follow that plan, as you early\r\nadopted it.\r\n\r\nThen after all, in such case, are the Azaleas, as they will ever be\r\ncalled in cultivation, to make the section Azalea, or is A. procumbens\r\nto take that name?...\r\n\r\nI wish you could see my Lowell anatomical illustrations. The pity is,\r\nthat I shall hardly use them in this course, now that my introductory\r\nlecture only brings me down to them. (but I shall have them spread to\r\nlook at), and I can only give to the subject about twenty minutes of my\r\nsecond lecture.\r\n\r\nBut it is very late indeed. Adieu.\r\n\r\nYours cordially,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nMarch 1, 1844.\r\n\r\nWell, you have heard what I had to say about my introductory lecture. I\r\nwas satisfied. I said plainly what I intended to say and delivered it\r\nnot very well indeed, but well enough to satisfy me that I could do well\r\nwith practice. This evening I have made a second trial, and a more\r\ntrying one by far. I have a cold and am a little hoarse, which was a\r\ngood thing, for as to voice I filled the house. As I was full of\r\nillustrations, quite as much as would cover the whole side of a barn, I\r\ndetermined to try the experiment of lecturing by the general guidance of\r\nmy notes only (which indeed were but partly written out). So with the\r\nlong pole in hand to point at the pictures I set at work, and talked\r\naway for an hour and ten minutes.\r\n\r\nI felt like a person who can hardly swim, thrown into the river, fairly\r\nin for it, and had to kick and strike to keep my head above water. The\r\nresults are these. I was by no means satisfied, and thought I had made\r\nalmost a failure. I left out many important points, I repeated myself a\r\nlittle now and then, and,--the usual result of extemporizing,--I did not\r\nget through, but was obliged to break off in the midst of the best of\r\nit. But, in spite of some difficulties of expression, and bad sentences,\r\nthe whole was probably more spirited in appearance than if I had\r\nfollowed my notes. And the audience generally seemed more moved by it\r\nthan by the first.\r\n\r\nI consider it thus far successful; that under unfavorable circumstances,\r\nfor I had no time to look over my notes beforehand, I made a desperate\r\nlunge, and yet avoided a real failure. It will place me so much at ease\r\nthat I can hereafter, with or without notes, look fairly at my audience\r\nwithout wincing. So I shall do better hereafter....\r\n\r\nI send you my notes (on Vacciniums) as far as written before I left for\r\nthe South last summer; and with all Boott’s memoranda as material. It\r\nwould be crazy for me now to attempt to make any memoranda, or even to\r\nmake the corrections that the new data require. Conclusions formed in\r\nhurly-burly are good for nothing; and I cannot, and must not, think of\r\nanything but my task. The two last of my lectures are not even arranged\r\nyet.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 1st March, 1844.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--I was very much gratified at receiving your kind letter\r\nof January 16; and I was quite startled at the lapse of time, I assure\r\nyou, when you reminded me that five years had elapsed since we were\r\nrunning about the streets of London together. Since that time you have\r\nseen the world, indeed, or some very out-of-the-way parts of it; and you\r\nnow stand in a perfectly unrivaled position as a botanist, as to\r\nadvantages, etc., with the finest collections and libraries of the world\r\nwithin your reach; and if you do not accomplish something worth the\r\nwhile, you ought not to bear the name of Hooker.\r\n\r\nI thank you most cordially for all the news you kindly give me\r\nrespecting the family, and wish to return my best thanks for being\r\nremembered to one and all. Your good old grandfather holds out so well\r\nthat really I sometimes think I may yet take him again by the hand; for\r\nI long to make another visit to England. Perhaps I may in two or three\r\nyears. But I hope ere that to see you here, where you may depend upon a\r\nmost hearty reception; and the Greenes (who send remembrances) join me\r\nstrenuously in begging you will make us a visit. After Sir William and\r\nLady Hooker (seniores priores), whom we cannot expect to see under\r\npresent circumstances, there is nobody in England I could so much wish\r\nto see as yourself.\r\n\r\nHad I time, I should fill this sheet with gossip about my occupations,\r\nplans, and prospects. Of these hereafter, for I hope our correspondence\r\nwill not end here. But I am now exceedingly pressed for time, having\r\njust commenced my course of public lectures in Boston on physiological\r\nbotany. Indeed I have the second lecture to give this evening, and much\r\npreparation yet to make for it. But I must tell you that in August next\r\nI am to take possession of the house which belongs to our little Botanic\r\nGarden,--a quiet pleasant place, where I am to set up a bachelor\r\nestablishment, have room enough for my herbarium, which I shall arrange\r\nà la Hooker, and a bed and a plate for a friend. So, if you wish to take\r\nan autumnal excursion, step on board the steamer and so drop in upon me\r\nsome morning, where you may depend upon--in a humble way--as cordial a\r\nreception as I once received in Scotland.\r\n\r\nSullivant, who is a good, spirited fellow, is delighted at the thought\r\nof receiving a set of your cryptogamic collections. As to your generous\r\nproposal to send another to some public collection in this country, we\r\nwill see. I will write something about it in due time.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 25th March, [1844].\r\n\r\nI think I should be an unhappy, discontented, unthankful person not to\r\nbe gratified with the success of my lectures. But it is not likely to\r\nturn my head. Everything proceeds quietly and soberly. I purposely\r\ndirected no tickets to be sent to a paper that often reports lectures,\r\nas I did not wish it done. There has not been a line in the papers about\r\nthe matter, except the very considerate notice about the beginning,\r\nwhich I sent you. My last week’s lectures are called much the best. The\r\nfirst, on the anatomy and physiology of leaves, and exhalation and its\r\nconsequences, occupied an hour and twenty minutes. My last, on food of\r\nplants, vegetable digestion, and the relations of plants to mineral and\r\nanimal kingdoms,--in which I did my very best, and which required and\r\nsecured the most intense attention on the part of the audience for a\r\nhundred minutes,--was received with an intelligent enthusiasm which did\r\nthe audience credit. For it would be mere affectation for me to pretend\r\nnot to know--as I well do--that it is one of the best scientific\r\nlectures that have ever been delivered in Boston. I have none left to\r\ncompare with it. I have only four more to give, during which I dare say\r\nthe interest will fall off; which will not disappoint or mortify me.\r\nFrom your truly kind remarks and warnings I suppose you look upon my\r\nsuccess in this undertaking as extremely hazardous to my best interests.\r\nNow this duty came to me unsolicited and unexpected. I accepted it\r\nbecause I thought it was my duty to do so. Then I was of course bound to\r\nmake every consistent effort to insure success. While viewing it at a\r\ndistance, I felt much anxiety. But before I commenced, this entirely\r\ndisappeared, and I have gone on just as coolly as you might do with your\r\nchemical course. I am thankful that (owing chiefly to the nature and\r\nnovelty of the subject) I have done my work creditably. The little éclat\r\nwhich attends it, I am not so foolish as to care anything for, pro or\r\ncon. It is entirely ephemeral. It may gratify my friends; but it does me\r\nno good, and I trust no harm. The general result may benefit the science\r\nof this part of the country. It will probably tend to advance my\r\ninterests, as I certainly wish it may, the object of my ambition being\r\nhigh and honorable, as well as moderate....\r\n\r\nThough I feel that I often--always--fail to do my whole duty, yet I do\r\nnot feel, nor believe, that a perfectly consistent Christian course\r\nwould expose me to persecution; nor that obloquy is a test of Christian\r\ncharacter. These are to be borne like other evils, when they are\r\nincurred in the course of one’s duty; but surely they are not to be\r\nsought, nor viewed as a test. Under the circumstances under which we are\r\nplaced, would our unexpectedly meeting with obloquy be any test to us\r\nthat we were doing right? Would it not lead us to suspect we had been at\r\nleast unwise? Such men as Payson or Edwards, though they may often have\r\nbeen pitied, I suspect, were never persecuted. But, while I think you\r\ntake a one-sided view and assume, an unscriptural test, in your own\r\ncase, I thank you most sincerely for your kind admonition to me, and\r\nwill try to profit by it. My sheet is fairly full.\r\n\r\nI need not say how delighted I should be to see you here; but you must\r\nnot come till the spring has fairly commenced, at least. The weather is\r\nexcessively unpleasant, the roads almost impassable; it snows every\r\nthree or four days, and not a speck of green is yet to be seen. A month\r\nlater it will be comfortable here. I fear I shall not have a place to\r\nreceive you before autumn, as a house is yet to be built for Dr. Walker.\r\nBut I should still like to have a visit from you in the course of the\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDr. Gray was always deeply interested in the religious thought of the\r\nday; reticent in regard to his own religious feelings and sensitive\r\nabout any exhibition of them, he was ready at any time to discuss\r\nproblems of theology and ecclesiasticism. His temper was naturally\r\nconservative, and he held by the habits of thought which had been early\r\nformed; but he was open to conviction, and by the process of his own\r\nthought broke through narrow bounds and rejoiced in all true progress in\r\nreligion, both for himself and others. In the matter of scriptural\r\nauthority, for example, he was in accord with Soame Jenyns, taking the\r\nground quoted here:\r\n\r\n“The Scriptures,” says that writer, in his “Internal Evidences of\r\nChristianity,” “are not revelations from God, but the history of them.\r\nThe revelations themselves are derived from God, but the history of them\r\nis the production of man. If the records of this revelation are supposed\r\nto be the revelation itself, the least defect discovered in them must be\r\nfatal to the whole. What has led many to overlook this distinction is\r\nthat common phrase that the Scriptures are the Word of God; and in one\r\nsense they certainly are; that is, they are the sacred repository of all\r\nthe revelations, dispensations, promises, and precepts which God has\r\nvouchsafed to communicate to mankind; but by this expression we are not\r\nto understand that every part of this voluminous collection of\r\nhistorical, poetical, prophetical, theological, and moral writing which\r\nwe call the Bible was dictated by the immediate influence of Divine\r\ninspiration.”\r\n\r\nHe held this ground strongly when the general view of the Bible was\r\nnarrower than of late years. As the years went on he grew broader and\r\nsweeter, feeling wider sympathy with all true, devout religious belief.\r\n\r\nHe was a constant church-goer, everywhere. When traveling he always made\r\nSunday a resting-day if possible, and would go quietly off in the\r\nmorning to find some place of service, in English if he could. He\r\nenjoyed the Episcopal service, though early habit and training had made\r\nhim a Presbyterian; but, as he wrote in an early letter, “In fact I have\r\nno more fondness for high Calvinistic theology than for German\r\nneology.... But I have no penchant for melancholy, sober as I sometimes\r\nlook, but turn always, like the leaves, my face to the sun.”\r\n\r\nHe was a teacher in Sunday-schools in New York (the lady with whom he\r\nboarded has still a lively remembrance of his enthusiastic study of\r\nGerman that he might teach his class of German boys better), and also in\r\nhis early years of Cambridge life, until the heavy load of work he was\r\ncarrying made the Sunday more imperative as a day of rest. It was his\r\nrule to rest on Sunday. Rest for him was change of intellectual\r\noccupation, and he read all of the day he was not out at church; more\r\nespecially on the philosophical questions, whether general or\r\nscientific, which next to botany were his chief interest. Books on these\r\nsubjects were the few he bought outside of works on botany; as he said,\r\nhe could only afford botanical books and had no money or room for\r\ngeneral literature. He read the leading magazines, and occasionally\r\nbiographies and travels, and if he had friends staying with him, Sunday\r\nwas the day for talk and discussion. A friend writes such a lively\r\nreminiscence of one of these Sunday discussions, on a stormy winter day\r\nwhich shut all in the house, that it seems worth giving as a vivid\r\ndescription of him.\r\n\r\n“Dr. Gray is more associated with the study and the room next it, but I\r\nrecall him there (in the parlor) also, especially in the visit of which\r\nyou wrote, made when Mr. John Carey was with you. He and the doctor\r\nheld one Sunday a long discussion on the Ten Commandments as binding\r\nupon Christians. Mr. Carey argued that their only claim upon our\r\nobedience consisted in their having been re-ordained (indorsed as it\r\nwere) by the church,--whether that meant the Holy Catholic or simply the\r\nAnglican Church was not decided, as I remember. Dr. Gray combated this\r\nextreme church view warmly and cleverly. Both were pugnacious amiably,\r\nas in their botanical fights. Both were excited, and the doctor showed\r\nhis excitement in his characteristically self-forgetful way, by moving\r\nor jumping nervously about the room, sitting on the floor, lying down\r\nflat, but laughing and sending sparks out of his eyes, and plying his\r\narguments and making his witty thrusts all the while. I enjoyed it very\r\nmuch, scarcely observing the odd positions any more than the doctor did.\r\nI had seen him so conduct himself before.”\r\n\r\nIt may be added to this that Dr. Gray was noticeable throughout his life\r\nfor his alertness. In the street he was usually on a half run, for he\r\nnever allowed himself quite time enough to reach his destination\r\nleisurely. When traveling by coach and climbing a hill he would\r\nsometimes alarm his fellow-travellers by suddenly disappearing through a\r\nwindow in his eagerness to secure some plant he had spied; his haste\r\nwould not suffer him to open a door. As his motions were quick, so that\r\nhe seemed always ready for a spring, so he found instant relaxation by\r\nthrowing himself flat on the floor when tired, to rest, like a child.\r\n\r\nHis physical characteristics expressed something of his mental\r\nqualities. He was quick and impetuous in temper, but his excitement was\r\nshort-lived, and his prevailing spirit was one of apparently\r\ninexhaustible good-nature. He was the cheeriest of household\r\ncompanions; rarely was he depressed, only indeed when greatly fagged\r\nwith some tremendous pressure of work or some worrying trouble difficult\r\nto settle; he was exceedingly hopeful, and always carried with him a\r\nhappy assurance that everything was going on well in his absence;\r\nwithal, he was fearless in all adventure, never willing to allow there\r\nhad been any danger when it had passed! He was fond of arguing, but no\r\npartisan, so that however earnest and dogmatic be might seem, the moment\r\nthe discussion was over there was no trace of bitterness or vexation\r\nleft. He was a clear and close reasoner himself, and thus impatient of\r\ndefective reasoning or a confused statement in others. He was quick,\r\ntoo, in turning his opponents’ weapons against them; sometimes he would\r\nescape from a dilemma in a merry, plausible form, but in serious\r\nargument he always insisted upon downright sincerity.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nApril 1, 1844.\r\n\r\nI finish my course of Lowell lectures this week, which have succeeded\r\nbeyond my most sanguine expectations. I have restricted myself to\r\nphysiological botany only,--taken up only great leading views,--used\r\nvery large paintings for illustrations, six to eight feet high, which\r\nthe great size of the room required, and then have given to sound\r\nscientific views a general popular interest.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, May 24, 1844.\r\n\r\nI have been using Dr. Wyman’s microscope of late, and it works well. By\r\nthe way, I have been studying fertilization a little, and have got out\r\npollen-tubes of great length; have followed them down the style, have\r\nseen them in the cavity of the ovary, and close to the orifice of the\r\novule.\r\n\r\nMy first views were in Asarum Canadense and A. arifolium, where I can\r\nvery well see the pollen-tubes with even my three-line doublet! I have\r\nseen them finely in Menyanthes; and in the ovary in Chelidonium!\r\n\r\nI am lecturing[135] in a popular and general way entirely on\r\nphysiological botany, and offering no encouragement to any to pursue\r\nsystematic botany this year. My great point is to make physiological\r\nbotany appear as it should be,--the principal branch in general\r\neducation. Next year I hope to take up the other branch.\r\n\r\nI am using the Lowell illustrations (though too large for my room), and\r\nam having no additional ones made for the college. For simple things I\r\ndepend much upon the blackboard. I have given two lectures on the\r\nlongevity of trees, and have a third yet to give, or at least half of\r\nanother....\r\n\r\nThe plants from the mountains have some done well, others poorly.\r\nBuckleyas had a hard time of it. Many are dead; none I think will flower\r\nthis season, as they only put out from the root. Diphylleia, Saxifraga\r\nCareyana, a new one like it, also S. erosa, etc., are now in flower.\r\nAstilbe is in bud, also Vaccinium ursinum. One Carex Fraseri flowered.\r\nHamiltonia only starts from the root.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1844, finding he needed more room for his rapidly increasing\r\nherbarium, Dr. Gray applied for the use of the Botanic Garden house,\r\nwhich since the death of Dr. Peck had been occupied for a while as a\r\nboarding-house, and later by Dr. and Mrs. Walker. He moved into it in\r\nSeptember, and there remained until the end of his life. He had a great\r\nattachment for the house, as the only one in which he had resided for\r\nany length of time; and it saw the gradual growth of his herbarium,\r\nneeding before many years the addition of a wing to give more room,\r\nuntil, having overrun all possible places for its accommodation, it was\r\nremoved in 1864 into the fireproof building which now holds it.\r\n\r\nThe garden was laid out by Dr. Peck in 1808, and the house built for him\r\nwas finished in 1810. Mr. Nuttall, the botanist and ornithologist, who\r\nboarded in it while giving instruction in botany, left some curious\r\ntraces behind him. He was very shy of intercourse with his fellows, and\r\nhaving for his study the southeast room, and the one above for his\r\nbedroom, put in a trap-door in the floor of an upper connecting closet,\r\nand so by a ladder could pass between his rooms without the chance of\r\nbeing met in the passage or on the stairs. A flap hinged and buttoned in\r\nthe door between the lower closet and the kitchen allowed his meals to\r\nbe set in on a tray without the chance of his being seen. A window he\r\ncut down into an outer door, and with a small gate in the board fence\r\nsurrounding the garden, of which he alone had the key, he could pass in\r\nand out safe from encountering any human being.\r\n\r\nThe garden, though small, was planned with much skill, and when Dr. Gray\r\nfirst lived on the place was much more filled up in the centre with\r\ntrees and shrubs, so that since one was unable to see from one path to\r\nanother, it seemed much larger than when more open. Dr. Peck, who had\r\nvisited Europe and learned much of botanical gardens there, when\r\ncomplimented on his success in laying it out, said that “he felt he had\r\nbeen at work on a pocket-handkerchief!” Dr. Gray, as his letters show,\r\nfell earnestly at work to restock the garden, and from his various\r\njourneys, his correspondents, and the many seeds and roots which were\r\ncoming in from the Western explorations soon made it a valuable spot for\r\nexchange. It is interesting to note how many plants, now the common\r\nstock of all gardens, were first grown and flowered here. One bed for\r\nmany years always went by the familiar name of “Texas,” as being the\r\nplace where the new Texan seeds were grown. The fund for endowment was\r\nvery small, and added greatly to the care of its oversight, because of\r\nthe effort to keep within the income. For two years after Dr. Gray was\r\nliving in the Garden house, he gave up two bed-rooms to the greenhouse\r\nplants, and so saved the Garden the expense of fuel for that period! One\r\nof his first deeds was to abolish the fee and make admission to the\r\nGarden free. It was the first--and remained for more than sixty years\r\nthe only--public botanic garden in the country.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nTuesday evening, October 1, 1844.\r\n\r\nI am about half fixed at the Garden, and shall probably sleep there\r\nto-morrow night. Were it not that my woman-kind has disappointed me, we\r\nshould dine there to-morrow....\r\n\r\nDr. Wyman[136] wishes much to accompany Frémont if he goes on another\r\njourney, entirely at his own expense, if need be. As his object is\r\nentirely zoölogy, he will not interfere with Frémont’s botanical plans,\r\nwhile the results would redound to Frémont’s advantage. He is a most\r\namiable, quiet, and truly gentlemanly fellow, retiring to a fault, but\r\nfull of nerve, and surely is to be the great man of this country in the\r\nhighest branches of zoölogy and comparative anatomy. I therefore very\r\nstrenuously solicit your influence at court in his behalf.\r\n\r\nI am glad that Frémont takes so much personal interest in his botanical\r\ncollections. He will do all the more. I should like to see his plants,\r\nespecially the Compositæ and Rosaceæ. As to Coniferæ he should have the\r\nTaxodium sempervirens, so imperfectly known, and probably a new genus.\r\nLook quick at it, for it is probably in Coulter’s collection which\r\nHarvey is working at....\r\n\r\nCordially yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nFebruary 12, 1845.\r\n\r\nMy first lecture is to-day finished, and has this evening been read to\r\nMr. Albro.[137] Half of it is devoted to a serving up of “Vestiges of\r\nCreation” (which Boott says is written by Sir Richard Vivian), showing\r\nthat the objectionable conclusions rest upon gratuitous and unwarranted\r\ninferences from established or probable facts. Peirce is examining\r\nMulder,[138] that we may fairly get at his point of view. His\r\nconclusions as to equivocal generation are non-constat from his own\r\npremises. On the whole series of subjects Peirce--who is much pleased\r\nwith the way I have put the case in my introductory--and myself think\r\nof concocting a joint article, though my time will prevent me from\r\nworking out some of the subsidiary points just now.\r\n\r\nI assure you I am quite well and hearty, just in capital working mood.\r\nAs to the lectures, I must work hard all the way through, but do not\r\nfeel any misgivings. My house is hot enough, I assure you; no trouble on\r\nthat score. As to spontaneous generation, the experiment of Schultz[139]\r\nis nearly or quite a test, and goes against it. Love to all.\r\n\r\nEver yours,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nThe next letter contains the first allusion to Isaac Sprague, so long\r\nassociated with Dr. Gray as illustrator of his works. Isaac Sprague was\r\nborn in Hingham in 1811. He early showed a faculty for observation, and\r\na gift for painting birds and flowers from nature. His talent was\r\ndiscovered, and he was invited by Audubon in 1843 to join his expedition\r\nto Missouri, and to assist in making drawings and sketches. President,\r\nthen Professor, Felton, having met him in Hingham, and knowing Dr. Gray\r\nwas looking for some one for his scientific drawings, recommended Mr.\r\nSprague, and he began with the illustrations for the Lowell lectures and\r\nthe new edition of the “Botanical Text-Book.” Dr. Gray was delighted\r\nwith his gift for beauty, his accuracy, his quick appreciation of\r\nstructure and his skill in making dissections. Mr. Sprague was from that\r\ntime the chief, and mostly only, illustrator for his books, both\r\neducational and purely scientific.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray is said to have stated that Mr. Sprague had but one\r\nrival,--Riocreux; and he considered that draughtsman’s classical\r\ndrawings inferior to Mr. Sprague’s.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, March 8, [1845?]\r\n\r\n... I finish Lichens this afternoon; and have next two lectures on Fungi\r\nand spontaneous generation to give. I interweave a good deal of matter,\r\nsuch as, on Ferns, the part they played in the early times of the world,\r\nà la Brongniart. Mosses, filling up lakes and pools; Sphagnum, Peat.\r\nLichens, first agents in clothing rocks with soil. I have noble\r\nillustrations of rust in wheat, ergot, etc., and Sprague is now hard at\r\nwork on smut, à la Bauer.\r\n\r\nYou remember the letter I sent you from Prestele of “Ebenezer, near\r\nBuffalo,” and which you still hold. Well, he has sent me for inspection\r\na most superb set of drawings, both of cultivated and of some native\r\nplants, exceedingly well done. Also specimens of his work in cutting on\r\nstone, which he does admirably. He did the work in Bischoff’s\r\n“Terminology,” which perhaps you remember, two quarto volumes. What a\r\npity he did not have the State-Flora plates to execute!\r\n\r\nIf Dr. Beck and yourself go on with your plan, he is your man to engrave\r\nthe plates on stone. Our Illicium is now in full flower; but I cannot\r\nspare Sprague a moment to draw it yet; unless, indeed, it is quite\r\ncertain you will want it this year, when I would try. He must work hard\r\nfor me two weeks longer....\r\n\r\nMy cutting up of “Vestiges of Creation” was a fine blow, and told.\r\nPeirce, who you know was rather inclined to favor Rogers a while ago, is\r\nnow sound and strong. We think of sending a critical analysis of the\r\nfirst part of Mulder, as our joint work (if he finds time to put in form\r\nthe physiological deductions I give him), to the meeting of geologists\r\nand naturalists at New Haven next month.\r\n\r\nMulder is very ingenious; but we can blow up the whole line of his\r\narguments, and show that it all amounts to nothing; that he has not in\r\nthis advanced our knowledge a particle; and that his generalizations are\r\nunsound. Why did you not have a part of my article reprinted in New\r\nYork? That would be the best reply to all his stuff.\r\n\r\nThe printing of my book will be through next week.\r\n\r\nMarch 30.\r\n\r\nI am now half through, and have got almost done with Fungi. The audience\r\ntake so much to the “Cryptogamic matters,” especially the afternoon\r\naudience, which is as a whole the most intelligent and refined, that I\r\nlet them run on, and they will occupy the whole course, except three\r\nlectures. I gave one lecture, generally thought nearly the best, on the\r\nlarge Fungi, mushrooms, truffles, morels, puff-balls, with some good\r\ngeneral matters. To-day I have taken the small ones, moulds, mildews,\r\nrust, and smut in wheat, with superb illustrations. Ergot is still left\r\nover, along with the diseases in potatoes, the plant of fermentation,\r\nthe Botrytis that kills silk-worms, with some recapitulatory matters on\r\nspontaneous generation, which must be cooked up for Friday. Then comes\r\nAlgæ; the large proper ones (Lecture 8), of which a fine series of\r\nillustrations is now nearly done.\r\n\r\nLecture 9. Then the low, minute forms and Confervæ come, and gory dew,\r\nred snow, superbly illustrated, ending with diatoms, transitions to\r\ncorallines through sponge, etc., and the locomotive spores of Confervæ,\r\nZoösporæ.\r\n\r\nLecture 10. Whole subject of spontaneous movements and sensibility in\r\nflowering plants, the life of plants, etc. (treated in a somewhat\r\noriginal way), and the real differences between plants and animals.\r\n\r\nLecture 11. The principles of classification. Individuals, species,\r\ntheir permanence, genera, orders, etc.\r\n\r\nLecture 12. Historical development. The Linnæan system, the natural.\r\nThis ends so as to give me a fine place to begin at next year....\r\n\r\nI shall soon be able to spare Sprague to draw the Illicium, if it still\r\nholds on. But I cannot spare him just yet. He has still to copy the\r\nred-snow bank from Ross, eighteen feet long!--finish two pieces of algæ,\r\netc., etc.\r\n\r\nTO A. DE CANDOLLE.\r\n\r\nApril 5, 1845.\r\n\r\nI anxiously wait for the notices of the life and writings of your\r\nlamented father, which you so kindly offer. I agree with you that that\r\nof Daubeny[140] gives the best view of the philosophy of his science;\r\nand yet there are points of view that he has not touched upon. You, of\r\ncourse, know better than any one else what were your father’s\r\nphilosophical views in natural history, his modes of thinking and\r\nworking; and if, when you send me the above-mentioned documents, you\r\nwould also feel at liberty to place such confidence in me as to give me\r\nyour own views and suggestions upon the subject, and especially upon\r\nthe points that other writers appear to have overlooked, I should be\r\nable to produce, in the “North American Review,” a much more important\r\narticle and a worthier tribute to the memory of one so revered on this\r\nside of the Atlantic as well as in Europe. May I hope you will favor me\r\nin this respect?\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the botanical news. I long to be delivered from the\r\npressure of the engagements that have consumed so much of my time for\r\nthe last year or two, and finish the “Flora of North America.”\r\n\r\nI remain, ever, my dear friend, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nAugust, 1845.\r\n\r\nThe new post-office law is an excellent thing, as it enables us to\r\nexchange our missives frequently, to send little pieces of news, and ask\r\nand answer questions without waiting for time and matter to fill up a\r\nformal letter.\r\n\r\nI must tell you a little change made in my sanctum here. You are to\r\nimagine me writing at a sort of bureau-escritoire (standing under Robert\r\nBrown’s picture), which I fortunately picked up the other day for $10.\r\nIt is of old dark wood a century old, and contains below four drawers,\r\nwhile the upper part, which opens into a fine writing-table, has eight\r\npigeon-holes, six drawers, and a little special lock-up with several\r\ndrawers and pigeon-holes more. You know I like any quantity of these\r\nstowaway places. I have sent upstairs the table which stood in its\r\nplace, and brought down the round one, so that I have more room than\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nOctober 14, 1845.\r\n\r\nYour excellent father lived to a truly patriarchal age. Mine, who has\r\nbeen in failing health for some time, I learn to-day is suddenly and\r\nextremely sick, and I set out for my birthplace immediately, in hopes\r\nyet to see him once more.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis father died October 13, before he reached Sauquoit. He had made his\r\nson a visit in Cambridge after he was established at the Garden house,\r\nmore especially to consult a physician for his failing health.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, November 15, 1845.\r\n\r\nMy visit to Oakes[141] I was chiefly to this intent. You know that I\r\nhave been waiting and waiting for Oakes to give, not his New England\r\n“Flora” (which I fear he will always leave unfinished), but a predromus\r\nof it, for my use and for New England. The consequence of waiting is\r\nthat Wood[142] is just taking the market, against my “Botanical\r\nText-Book,” mostly by means of his “Flora.” Letters from Hitchcock--and\r\nelsewhere--all point to the probability that they will have to use his\r\nbook (of which, by the way, he is preparing a second edition, which he\r\ncannot but improve), and ask me to prevent it by appending a brief\r\ndescription of New England or Northern plants to my “Botanical\r\nText-Book.” A plan has occurred to me by which this might be done, were\r\nit not that I will not tread on the heels of anything that Oakes (who\r\nhas devoted a life of labor to this end) will actually do.\r\n\r\nAs something must be done at once, I have proposed to Oakes to make\r\nmyself the necessary conspectuses of orders, analyses, etc.; to join the\r\nproposed thing on, or to dove-tail it into, the “Text-Book;” and also to\r\nfurnish the generic characters, and he is to write the specific\r\ncharacters and all that for New England plants. I give him as limit 250\r\npages brevier type, 12mo (say 300), and insist upon having the greater\r\npart of the copy on the 1st March, and that it shall be published on the\r\n1st April. That I may cover the ground of Wood, and introduce it into\r\nNew York, I propose, if you think it right and proper, to add the\r\ncharacters of the (about 150) New York plants not found in New England,\r\ndistinguishing that by a †.\r\n\r\nOakes promises to do it. But our understanding is explicit that if he\r\ncannot get through with it in time, he is soon to let me know, and to\r\nfurnish me with New England matters, when I am to do, not exactly this,\r\nbut a more compendious manual of the botany of New England, New York,\r\nNew Jersey, and Pennsylvania, that is, the Northern States proper. It\r\nwill be imperfect and hasty, but it will prevent Wood from fixing\r\nhimself so that he cannot be driven out.\r\n\r\nI propose to have a sufficient number of copies of this (in whatever\r\nform it may appear) bound up with the “Botanical Text-Book” to meet the\r\ndemands of the one-book system in New England and New York, and to\r\nafford it at a price reduced to a minimum, so that nothing is to be made\r\nout of it, at least out of the first edition.\r\n\r\nHow does this all strike you? I am convinced that something must be\r\ndone, and I will see if we can’t have a very popular, and at the same\r\ntime a pretty good book.\r\n\r\nGeorge[143] sends his warm regards.\r\n\r\n21st November, 1845.\r\n\r\nI have driven Oakes so absolutely into a corner that I think he will\r\nwork for once. The man’s preparations and materials are enormous! and\r\nfor his sake I hope he will. If he does not, I shall know in time,--that\r\nis, as soon as I can use the knowledge,--and then the plan may take such\r\nform as may be deemed best. I should then wish to make it more\r\nabsolutely a supplement of “Botanical Text-Book;” but only for the\r\nproper North. In the way in which it would then be done, with\r\nPersoonish[144] compactness and brevity, I doubt if you would care to\r\nengage in it. As soon as we can get out the proper Botany of the United\r\nStates, I should wish it to supersede this to a great extent. In my\r\nhands, I would sell it so cheaply as to make very little, except as it\r\npromotes the sale of the “Botanical Text-Book.” I would sell the\r\n“Text-Book” with it for $2, or less even. The great object is to keep\r\nthe ground clear by running an uncompromising opposition against the\r\nthreatening interlopers.\r\n\r\nMy lectures are to commence January 13th.\r\n\r\nTO J. D. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 31st December, 1845.\r\n\r\nI was much pleased to receive your pleasant letter of the 29th October\r\nlast, and I read with interest the account of the debate on the occasion\r\nof the election by the Edinburgh Town Council. Such defeats can do you\r\nno harm. I suppose you are now going on with the “Flora Antarctica.” I\r\nneed not say that I should be very glad to see the Antarctic plants of\r\nthe Wilkes Expedition in your hands. The botanist who accompanied the\r\nexpedition is no doubt perfectly incompetent to the task, so greatly so\r\nthat probably he has but a remote idea how incompetent he is. I have not\r\nseen him nor the plants. Certainly I would not touch them (any but the\r\nOregon and Californian) if they were offered to me, which they are not\r\nlikely to be. I consider myself totally incompetent to do such a work\r\nwithout making it a special study for some years, and going abroad to\r\nstudy the collections accumulated in Europe. Of course if they are\r\nworked up at all in this country, they will be done disgracefully. I\r\npublicly expressed my opinion on the subject in “Silliman’s Journal.”\r\nBut I have long been convinced that nothing can be done. The whole\r\nbusiness has been in the hands till now of Senator----, the most\r\nobstinate, wrong-headed, narrow-minded, impracticable ignoramus that\r\ncould well be found.... If to this you add an utter ignorance of those\r\nprinciples of comity and the spirit of interchange that prevail among\r\nnaturalists, and a total want of comprehension of what is to be done in\r\nthe scientific works in question, and you will see that nothing is to be\r\nexpected from such sources. They have thrown every obstacle they could\r\nin the way of their naturalists--Dana and Pickering, for instance--so\r\nmuch so that Pickering, though a patient man, once threw up his position\r\nin disgust, I have heard, but, by some concessions made to him, was\r\nfinally persuaded to retain it.\r\n\r\nSome of the scientific reports will soon be published, Dana on the\r\nCorals, etc., which will, I suppose, be very creditable to him. When any\r\nof the volumes appear I am somewhat inclined to call public attention to\r\nsome of this gross mismanagement and incompetency in these wrong-headed\r\nmanagers, in a review. I thank you very much for all the botanical news\r\nyou give, and hope you will still favor me now and then with other such\r\nepistles.\r\n\r\nI have never worked so hard as for the last four years, nor accomplished\r\nso much. Still it will not show for much in your eyes, and I receive\r\nmany an exhortation like yours to go on with the “Flora.” But a world of\r\nwork that could only be done by myself, the pressure of the duties of my\r\nnew position, and the necessity of taking, indeed of creating, and\r\nmaintaining a stand that should make my department felt and appreciated,\r\nhas indeed sadly interrupted the work which I am of all others most\r\ndesirous to complete. I have already a great deal of matter in a state\r\nof forwardness, and another year (Deo favente) will, I trust, give you a\r\nbetter account of me. My last course of public lectures in Boston\r\ncommences in a fortnight, and will be over towards the close of\r\nFebruary. You will admit that there is some temptation to a person who\r\nhas so many uses for money, when I tell you that I received twelve\r\nhundred dollars for the delivery of twelve lectures, and that there are\r\nstrong reasons beyond what the institution that employs me may justly\r\ndemand, that I should do my best. This, however, will soon be over, and\r\nthe “Flora” shall be pushed with vigor.... I greatly long to revisit\r\nEngland and to see you all once more. Nothing would delight me more; and\r\nthere is a world of work I want to do in the collections of England and\r\nthe Continent. Indeed you may look to see me one of these days, for I\r\ncannot long be satisfied or quiet without such a visit; though I shall\r\nhardly dare to show my face till the “Flora” is finished. How glad I\r\nshall be to see you in your quarters at Kew, and renew my acquaintance\r\nwith all the family, of whom I retain so many pleasant memories. With\r\nkind regards to all, believe me,\r\n\r\nEver your affectionate friend, A. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 26, 1846.\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 22d I found this evening on my return from my\r\nafternoon’s lecture. I am very tired and cannot write much this evening.\r\nFour of my lectures[145] are off. You will be glad to know that they\r\nhave gone off very well--the three first admirably; indeed I was\r\nsurprised myself at the fluency, ease, and “enlargement” which was given\r\nme. The fourth, both last evening and this afternoon, was\r\npoorer--interesting details, but scrappy, and less comfort in speaking.\r\nSplendid illustrations up though.... The pictures were worth something,\r\nif the lecture was not. I shall spur myself up hard for those four to\r\ncome, which are fully illustrated, in fact a complete _embarras de\r\nrichesses_. Then come the four geographical lectures, which if Sprague\r\ngets the illustrations ready will be very interesting, I think. I must\r\nwork them off well, for at least two of our seven members of corporation\r\nare constant hearers.\r\n\r\n... There is a formidable amount of work of various sorts that should be\r\naccomplished (Deo favente) before the July vacation.... The\r\ncontemplated expedition is a land one, from Lake Superior by North Pass\r\nto upper Oregon, down to Lewis River; up that, and then over to the Gila\r\nRiver in California. I know of no botanist to go. Can you find one?\r\nSprague cannot be spared, and will not leave his wife and family for so\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n... Some of our Congressmen must feel a little ashamed that England is\r\nso cool and quiet in spite of all their bluster. Capital for peace that\r\nthe Peel ministry is still in. We owe much gratitude to the new Lord\r\nGrey....\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, April 8, 1846.\r\n\r\nWhat is Lindheimer about? Why is not his last year’s collection yet with\r\nyou? We have just got things going, and we can sell fifty sets right off\r\nof his further collections, and he can go on and realize a handsome sum\r\nof money, if he will only work now! And he will connect his name forever\r\nwith the Texan Flora!\r\n\r\nI am at the “Flora” again and hope to do great things this year,--shall\r\nwork hard and constantly.\r\n\r\nBesides, by the aid of my young and excellent artist Sprague’s drawings,\r\nand Prestele to engrave cheaply and neatly on stone, I am going to\r\ncommence a Genera Illustrata of the United States, like T. Nees von\r\nEsenbeck’s “Genera Germanica Iconibus Illustrata.”--the plates to be\r\nequally good, and quite cheap too. The first volume, one hundred plates,\r\ngoing on regularly from Ranunculaceæ, will be preparing this summer, and\r\nwill be out in the fall....\r\n\r\nMay 30.\r\n\r\nHave done something at the “Flora;” shall do much work this season after\r\nJuly 4th, when college duties are over. Drawings for “Genera” are\r\ngetting on well.\r\n\r\nOne word now on another point. We must have a collector for plants\r\nliving and dry to go to Santa Fé, with the Government Expedition. If I\r\nwere not so tied up, I would go myself. Have you not some good fellow\r\nyou can send? We could probably get him attached somehow so as to have\r\nthe protection of the army, and if need be I could raise here two\r\nhundred dollars as an outfit. He could make it worth the while. He could\r\ncollect sixty sets of five hundred plants (besides seeds and Cacti) very\r\nsoon, which, named by us, would go off at once at ten dollars per\r\nhundred. Somebody must go into this unexplored field! Let me know if you\r\nthink anything can be done, and I will set to work. The great thing is a\r\nproper man.\r\n\r\nJuly 15.\r\n\r\nI duly received your favor of June 25th; am delighted that you found a\r\nman to send to Santa Fé. I approve your mode of carrying out the plan,\r\nand will not be slow to aid in it. I wrote at once to Sullivant, telling\r\nhim to forward fifty dollars for Fendler,[146]--to take his pay in\r\nMosses and Hepaticæ, and to give instructions about collecting these,\r\nhis great favorites. Before this reaches you, I am sure you will hear\r\nfrom him. He is a capital fellow, and Fendler must be taught to collect\r\nMosses for him.\r\n\r\nThen came your letter of July 3d. All right. I immediately wrote to\r\nMarcy, the Secretary of War, and to Colonel Abert, the head of the\r\nTopographical Engineer Corps; asked for protection and transportation;\r\ntold the secretary to send anything he might be disposed to do to you at\r\nSt. Louis. I then inclosed your letter to Mr. Lowell, and have just\r\nreceived it back again, with his letter, which I inclose to you! Is it\r\nnot handsome?... Now Fendler has money enough to begin with. As soon as\r\nhe is in the field, and shown by his first collections that he is\r\ndeserving, I can get as much more money advanced for him, from other\r\nparties. If he only makes as good and handsome specimens as Lindheimer,\r\nall will be well. His collections should commence when he crosses the\r\nArkansas; his first envoi should be the plants between that and Santa\r\nFé, and be sent this fall, with seeds, cacti, and bulbs, the former of\r\nevery kind he can get. These must be confined to yourself, Mr. Lowell,\r\nand me, till we see what we get by raising them. Other live plants he\r\nhad better not attempt now.\r\n\r\nHis next collection must be at and around Santa Fé. But instruct him to\r\nget into high mountains, or as high as he can find, whenever he can. The\r\nmountains to the north of Santa Fé often rise to the snowline, and are\r\nperfectly full of new things. But you can best judge what instructions\r\nto give him. We can sell just as many sets of plants as he will make\r\ngood specimens of. But forty sets is about as many as he ought to\r\nmake....\r\n\r\nIt is said that a corps of troops is to be sent up through Texas towards\r\nNew Spain. Lindheimer ought to go along, and so get high up into the\r\ncountry, where so much is new, and the plants have really “no Latin\r\nnames.”\r\n\r\nOctober 8th.\r\n\r\nBy the way, meeting Agassiz last evening, I was pleased to learn that he\r\nclaimed you as a schoolmate, and spoke of you with lively pleasure. He\r\nis a fine, pleasant fellow. We shall take good care of him here.\r\n\r\nJanuary 5, 1847.\r\n\r\nI am glad so fine a collection is on the way from Lindheimer, and\r\ngreatly approve his going to the mountains on the Guadaloupe. How high\r\nare the mountains? If good, real mountains, and he can get on to them,\r\nand into secluded valleys, he will do great things....\r\n\r\nWe will keep ahead of the Bonn people. By the close of next summer (Deo\r\nfavente) we may hope to have the botany of Texas pretty well in our\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nDo you hear from Fendler? Hooker says that region, the mountains\r\nespecially, is the best ground to explore in North America! There is a\r\nhigh mountain right back of Santa Fé. Fendler must ravish it.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nWednesday, [October, 1846].\r\n\r\nA Mr. Baird,[147] of Carlisle, Pa., called on me yesterday, evidently a\r\nmost keen naturalist (ornithology principally), but a man of more than\r\ncommon grasp. He talked about an evergreen-leaved Vaccinium, which I\r\nhave no doubt is V. brachycerum, Mx., that I have so long sought in\r\nvain!...\r\n\r\n13th October, 1846.\r\n\r\nI leave Agassiz in New York. He will leave New York Wednesday morning;\r\njoin me at Princeton, and go on with us to Philadelphia that evening.\r\nWe shall probably go together to Carlisle, where he has something to do\r\nwith that capital naturalist, Professor Baird, and I have to get live\r\nVaccinium brachycerum. He will soon return to make ready his lectures\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nAgassiz is an excellent fellow, and I know you will be glad to make his\r\npersonal acquaintance. I must make my stay, such as it can be, at\r\nPrinceton, on my return....\r\n\r\n9th December, 1846.\r\n\r\nAgassiz lectured first last evening; fine audience; he had a cold; was\r\nvery hoarse, so that he spoke with discomfort to himself, but it went\r\noff very well. Though he by no means did himself justice, the audience\r\nseemed well pleased, and the persons I spoke with at the time, the most\r\nintelligent people, were quite delighted and impressed. He has repeated\r\nto-day. I expect to hear him again on Friday....\r\n\r\nI have sixteen proofs of “Genera Illustrata.” The engraving is clean and\r\nneat, but except a few of the last, they are not done so well as we\r\nexpect, and do not do justice to the drawings, which, indeed, are almost\r\nmatchless. Prestele has, in some, altered the arrangement of the\r\nanalyses on the plate; consequently they must be done over again.\r\n\r\nI am clear that Prestele can do what I want, so I have given him further\r\ninstructions, and have raised his pay to $2.50 each; increasing my own\r\nrisk thereby. Sprague has discovered some new quiddities about the\r\nposition of the ovule in Ranunculaceæ. The raphe is dorsal in all of\r\nthem, with pendulous ovules; also in Nelumbium.\r\n\r\nHe will go on very slowly; I can’t hurry him. He has not yet taken up\r\nCroomia.\r\n\r\nYou have not told me about Chapman’s queer plant yet!...\r\n\r\nUnless Nuttall has arrived, which I do not hear of, it is too late for\r\nhim till next fall; for his object was to secure three months’ absence\r\nout of the present year, and three out of next.[148]\r\n\r\nJanuary 24, 1847.\r\n\r\nAgassiz has finished his lectures with great eclât--most admirable\r\ncourse--and on Thursday evening last he volunteered an additional one in\r\nFrench, which was fine.\r\n\r\nI gave you the explanation you asked for in my last letter, which I\r\nstill hope you will find. What I then said about the excellent tone of\r\nhis lectures generally was fully sustained to the last; they have been\r\ngood lectures on natural theology. The whole spirit was vastly above\r\nthat of any geological course I ever heard, his refutation of Lamarckian\r\nor “Vestiges” views most pointed and repeated. The whole course was\r\nplanned on a very high ground, and his references to the Creator were so\r\nnatural and unconstrained as to show that they were never brought in for\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe points that I. A. Smith has got hold of were a few words at the\r\nclose of his lecture on the geographical distribution of animals, in\r\nwhich he applied the views he maintains (which are those of Schouw still\r\nfurther extended) to man.\r\n\r\nHe thinks that animals and plants were originally created in numbers,\r\noccupying considerable area, perhaps almost as large as they now occupy.\r\nI should mention that he opposes Lyell and others who maintain that\r\nvery many of the Tertiary species are the same as those now existing. He\r\nbelieves there is not one such, but that there was an entirely new\r\ncreation at the commencement of the historic era, which is all we want\r\nto harmonize geology with Genesis. Now, as to man he maintains\r\ndistinctly that they are all one species. But he does not believe that\r\nthe Negro and Malay races descended from the sons of Noah, but had a\r\ndistinct origin. This, you will see, is merely an extension of his\r\ngeneral view. We should not receive it, rejecting it on other than\r\nscientific grounds, of which he does not feel the force as we do.\r\n\r\nBut so far from bringing this against the Bible, he brings the Bible to\r\nsustain his views, thus appealing to its authority instead of\r\nendeavoring to overthrow it. He shows from it (conclusively) that all\r\nthe sons of Noah (Ham with the rest) were the fathers of the extant\r\nCaucasian races,--races which have remained nearly unaltered from the\r\nfirst, and that if any negroes proceeded from Ham’s descendants, it must\r\nhave been by a miracle. That is the upshot of the matter. We may reject\r\nhis conclusions, but we cannot find fault with his spirit, and I shall\r\nbe glad to know that Dr. I. A. Smith, in the whole course of his public\r\nteaching, has displayed a reverence for the Bible equal to that of\r\nAgassiz. I have been on the most intimate terms with him: I never heard\r\nhim express an opinion or a word adverse to the claims of revealed\r\nreligion. His admirable lectures on embryology contain the most original\r\nand fundamental confutation of materialism I ever heard.\r\n\r\nI make the “Manual” keep clear of slavery,--New Jersey, Pennsylvania (if\r\nlittle Delaware manumits perhaps I can find a corner for it), Ohio,\r\nIndiana or not as the case may be, leave out Illinois, which has too\r\nmany Mississippi plants, take in Michigan and Wisconsin, at least\r\nLapham’s[149] plants near the Lakes. That makes a very homogeneous\r\nflorula.\r\n\r\nI have made as usual much less progress than I supposed; so now, pressed\r\nat the same time with college duties, I have to work very hard indeed.\r\nCarey is coming on to help me.... Sheet full.\r\n\r\nJuly 20, 1847.\r\n\r\nDid you not know that an application has come from Wilkes through\r\nPickering[150] to Sprague to make some botanical drawings for the\r\nExploring Expedition, which, as I supposed they were to be for your use,\r\nI persuaded Sprague to promise to undertake, at ten dollars for each\r\nfolio drawing with the dissections full.... The price we fixed is as low\r\nas Sprague can do them for, to any advantage, even if he had nothing\r\nelse to do. The price I fixed for the drawings of “Genera,” and which I\r\nthought very large, ($6 per plate) does not thus far pay Sprague day\r\nwages, he takes so much time and care with them. I can only hope that\r\nthe experience and facility he is getting will enable him to knock them\r\noff faster hereafter. You see therefore that Sprague cannot afford to\r\nmake the drawings for Emory at the price he made those for Frémont--two\r\ndollars apiece. He will do them better; having now such skill in\r\ndissections he will display structure finely, but he must not undertake\r\nthem under six dollars apiece, since they will cost him as much time as\r\ndo my octavo “Genera” drawings. He might make what you want along this\r\nsummer and autumn; I am not crowding him.\r\n\r\nSeptember 28, 1847.\r\n\r\nI had a pleasant visit to Litchfield of three days, including the\r\nSabbath. On the banks of a lake in the neighborhood I stumbled on a\r\nspecies of Cyperus dentatus, which in the “Flora of the Northern States”\r\nyou credit to Litchfield, Brace.[151] This Mr. Brace, who is an uncle of\r\nJ.’s, I met for a moment at New Milford, where he now lives. There are\r\nthree great aunts, most excellent old ladies, who live in a simple and\r\nmost delightful manner at Litchfield. The youngest, who has been J.’s\r\nguardian almost from infancy, returned with us to Boston for a week or\r\ntwo. Their brother, Mr. Pierce, who died only last year, was, it seems,\r\nan old friend of yours, through whom they feel almost acquainted with\r\nyou. He passed a part of his life in New York, was a mineralogist, and I\r\nthink I have seen his name as a member of the Lyceum. Pray tell me about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nI found it not easy to make an arrangement in New York for the\r\npublication of the “Illustrated Genera,” by which I could get back\r\ndirectly the money I have expended in it. I think, therefore, I shall go\r\non to defray the expenses of the first volume myself, which I think I\r\nshall be able to do, and thus manage to get the immediate proceeds\r\nmyself. As to the “Manual,” I have unwittingly made it so large, in\r\nspite of all my endeavors at compression, that I can make nothing to\r\nspeak of from the first edition, even if it sells right off.\r\n\r\nTO J. L. L.\r\n\r\nMonday evening, 9 o’clock, 1847.\r\n\r\nWhen I reached home Henry and Agassiz were here. No one else came (as I\r\nexpected), and Agassiz insisted on returning in the nine o’clock\r\nomnibus. Agassiz and Henry enjoy and admire each other so richly, and\r\ntalk science so glowingly and admiringly, that I think I should not have\r\nbeen at all surprised to see them exchange kisses before they were done.\r\nAnd Agassiz told him he meant to come to Cambridge, and they began to\r\ntalk of their children, and Agassiz read extracts from letters just\r\nreceived from his wife and his son, who--to Agassiz’s great pride and\r\nsatisfaction--had just climbed the Fellenberg in the Breisgau, slept on\r\nthe summit in the open air to see the sun rise in the morning, then\r\ndescended and walked, I forget how many miles. Pretty well for a lad of\r\neleven.\r\n\r\nIt is not a year since I told Henry that he should have either Agassiz\r\nor Wyman at Washington, but that we must have one of them at Cambridge.\r\nBeyond all expectation we have them both!\r\n\r\nHenry gave me--I know not what led to it--a full detailed account of his\r\nlife from early boyhood, which was full of curious interest and\r\nsuggested much matter for reflection. In the evening we fell to\r\ndiscoursing on philosophical topics, and Henry threw out great and noble\r\nthoughts, and as we both fell to conversing with much animation my\r\nheadache disappeared entirely. There is no man from whom I learn so much\r\nas Henry. He calls out your own powers, too, surprisingly....\r\n\r\nI have been addling my brain and straining my eyes over a set of ignoble\r\nPond-weeds (alias Potamogeton) trying to find the\r\n\r\n          “difference there should be\r\n    Twixt tweedle-dum and tweedle-dee,”\r\n\r\nand wasting about as much brain in the operation as your dear paternal\r\nwould expend in an intricate law case, for all of which I suppose nobody\r\nwill thank me and I shall get no fee. Indeed, few would see the least\r\nsense in devoting so much time to a set of vile little weeds. But I\r\ncould not slight them. The Creator seems to have bestowed as much pains\r\non them, if we may use such a word, as upon more conspicuous things, so\r\nI do not see why I should not try to study them out. But I shall be glad\r\nwhen they are done, which I promise they shall be before I sleep.\r\n\r\n10.45 P.M.--There, the pond-weeds are done fairly.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 1st, 1847.\r\n\r\nI reply early to your kind letter of October 30th to assure you that I\r\nshall with much pleasure contribute so far as I have opportunity to the\r\nnew Botanical Museum, which, under your charge, and with your great\r\nopportunities for obtaining things from every part of the world, will\r\nsoon become a magnificent collection. I have already several things to\r\nsend you, such as two very large entwined stems of Aristolochia Sipho,\r\nwhich I brought from the mountains of Carolina.; a Dasylirion from\r\nTexas, etc. I have some time ago made arrangements for getting curious\r\nstems from Para, through a friend in Salem, who will also incite the\r\nmasters and supercargoes of ships from that port which trade with\r\nvarious out-of-the-way parts of the world. The first things sent from\r\nPara were slabs rather than truncheons of wood (all ordinary exogenes),\r\nbut I am promised palm stems and woody climbers, of which I shall take a\r\nportion to build up our general Natural History Museum at Cambridge,\r\nwhich with the zeal of Agassiz and Wyman is now likely to grow; the rest\r\nI will send to you. If you will send me a few duplicates of your\r\ncircular, I will have them placed in proper hands where they may turn to\r\ngood account. I am delighted to hear such pleasant things of Dr. Hooker,\r\nwhich I had also heard last summer from Mrs. McGilvray. I owe him a\r\nletter, but it is too late to send my congratulations, now that he is\r\nprobably far on the way to India. I admire his zeal and energy, and wish\r\nhim an excellent time and a prosperous return. The government has\r\nbehaved most handsomely in affording him such important aid in his\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nProper specimens of maple sugar will keep perfectly well if placed in a\r\nglass jar with a closed cover. I will surely send some in the spring.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, December 20, 1847.\r\n\r\nI got a parcel from New York on Saturday evening, containing a few\r\nwelcome plants of Wislizenus’[152] collection, and a set of Fendler’s\r\nfrom Santa Fé, up to Rosaceæ. The specimens are perfectly charming! so\r\nwell made, so full and perfect. Better never were made. In a week I\r\nshall take them right up to study, and they are Rocky Mountain forms of\r\nvegetation entirely, so I can do it with ease and comfort. It is a cool\r\nregion that, and dry. If these come from the plains, what will the\r\nmountains yield? Fendler must go back, or a new collector, now that\r\norder is restored there.\r\n\r\nAll Fendler’s collection will sell at once, no fear, such fine specimens\r\nand so many good plants. Pity that F. did not know enough to leave out\r\nsome of the common plants, except two or three specimens for us, and\r\nbestow the same labor on the new plants around him.\r\n\r\nSend on the rest soon.\r\n\r\nYours cordially,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES WRIGHT.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 17, 1848.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND,--That I ought to have replied to your letter of the 19th\r\nNovember, to say nothing of that of September 21 and June 18, there is\r\nno doubt. The letter I have carried in my pocket a good while, hoping to\r\ncatch a moment somewhere and some time to write to you, especially as\r\nthe time approaches in which I may be sending a parcel to New Orleans\r\nfor you. But I have not had an hour’s leisure not demanded by letters of\r\nimmediate pressing consequence, or in which I was not too tired to\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\nThere are many correspondents whom I have neglected almost as much as I\r\nhave you. I have worked like a dog, but my work laid out to be finished\r\nlast July is not done yet.\r\n\r\nBut from about the time of your last letter a providential dispensation\r\nhas prevented me from doing what I would, namely, the sickness, by\r\ntyphoid fever, of a beloved brother (a Junior in college here), who\r\nrequired every leisure moment from the time he became seriously sick up\r\nto the 9th inst.--a week ago--when it pleased the Sovereign Disposer of\r\nevents, to whom I bow, to remove him to a better world; and I am but\r\nrecently returned from the mournful journey to convey to the paternal\r\nhome (in western New York) his mortal remains. This has somewhat\r\ninterrupted the printing of the last sheets of my “Manual of North\r\nAmerican Botany;” which, with all my efforts at condensation, has\r\nextended to almost eight hundred pages!! (12mo), including the\r\nintroduction. It will be difficult to get the volume within covers. A\r\nyear’s hard labor is bestowed upon it; I hope it will be useful and\r\nsupply a desideratum. As a consolation for my honest faithfulness in\r\nmaking it tolerably thorough, and so much larger than I expected it\r\nwould prove, it is now clear that I shall get nothing or next to it for\r\nmy year’s labor. At the price to which it must be kept to get it into\r\nour schools, etc., there is so little to be made by it, that I cannot\r\ninduce a publisher to pay the heavy bills, except upon terms which\r\nswallow up all the proceeds; or at the very least I may get $200, if it\r\nall sells, a year or two hence.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I have paid the expenses principally incurred on the first\r\nvolume of “Illustrated Genera,” which I can’t print and finish till the\r\n“Manual” is out; have run heavily into debt in respect to these works,\r\nwhich were merely a labor of love for the good of the science and an\r\nhonorable ambition; and how I am going to get through I cannot well\r\nsee....\r\n\r\nI should despond greatly if I were not of a cheerful temperament....\r\n\r\nI wish I could write to you as you wish, all about botany, etc. I wish I\r\ncould aid you as I desire, but I fear it is impossible. I must have rest\r\nand less anxiety. Two more years like the last would probably destroy\r\nme. If I had an assistant or two, to take details off my hands, I might\r\nstand it; as it is I cannot. Carey spent three months with me last\r\nseason, and was to study and ticket your Texan collection in my hands,\r\ntake a set for his trouble, and Mr. Lowell and Mr. S. T. Carey would\r\ntake what they needed and pay for them, so that I could pay your\r\nbook-bill at Fowle’s. The utmost Carey found time to do was to throw the\r\ncollection into orders; there they still lie, in the corner! There\r\nperhaps they had best lie, now, till the collection of the past season\r\nreaches me, when I will try to study them all together, along with\r\nLindheimer’s collections, a set of which still waits for me to study\r\nthem. Will you wonder that I am a little disheartened when, in spite of\r\nevery effort, I make so little progress? And in six weeks I begin to\r\nlecture in college again; and in April the Garden will require more time\r\nthan I can give it. Such are merely some of the things on my hands, some\r\nof my cares! Still I am interested in you, and in your collections, and\r\nwill do what I can....\r\n\r\nThen if you will continue to send seeds (pretty largely), also bulbs,\r\ncacti, tubers, etc., now in early spring (and root-cuttings of some\r\nvines), taking pains that they are sent in a direct way, so as to come\r\nalive in May, etc., I will get an appropriation allowed from the Garden\r\nfor you. Don’t try other live plants till we have better communication\r\nwith Texas. We have sunk money in this already and had to give it up....\r\n\r\nForgive my long neglect; accept my apologies. I’ll see if I can do any\r\nbetter hereafter, when I have a wife to write letters for me.\r\n\r\nMarch 10th.\r\n\r\nBesides all the rest, the Academy’s correspondence presses hard on me. I\r\nhave written twenty-four letters for the steamer to-morrow. Fairly to\r\nkeep up my correspondence and answer all my letters would take full two\r\nhours every day of the week except the Sabbath. So have mercy, and long\r\npatience....\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my “Manual” is out; but not published till the 10th February.\r\nWhat can you expect from a man who takes up a job in February, 1847, to\r\nfinish in May or June certain; but who, though he works like a dog, and\r\nthrows by everything else, does not get it done till February comes\r\nround again. So it is only now that I have anything to send you. I am\r\nnow printing off my “Genera Illustrata”--the text for one hundred\r\nplates; mean to have it out in a month; but I will not wait any\r\nlonger....\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, February 29, 1848.\r\n\r\n... Now for Fendler himself. He ought to go back, and without delay. He\r\nhas gained much experience, and will now work to greater advantage. He\r\nmakes unrivaled specimens, and with your farther instructions will\r\ncollect so as to make more equable sets. If he will stay and bide his\r\ntime he can get on to the mountains, and must try the higher ones,\r\nespecially those near Taos.\r\n\r\nLet him stay two years, and if he is energetic he will reap a fine\r\nharvest for botany, and accumulate a pretty little sum for himself, and\r\nhave learned a profession, for such that of a collector now is. Drummond\r\nmade money quite largely.\r\n\r\nI had rather Fendler would go north and west than south of Santa Fé.\r\nNew Spain and Rocky Mountain botany is far more interesting to us than\r\nMexican.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nMarch 29, 1848.\r\n\r\nYour parcel came to-day; many thanks. After dinner I have just looked\r\nover the Mexican Compositæ of Gregg,[153] which are numerous, and quite\r\na bonne bouche. My old love of the dear pappose creatures revived at the\r\nsight, and I longed to take them by the beard. If at liberty to do so\r\n(am I?) I think I will, at the same time I do the Santa-Féans; and at\r\nthe same time I will study any of Abert’s or Emory’s Mexican or North\r\nSpain Compositæ you have not already disposed of. As to the parcel to be\r\ndivided, of which there are no duplicates, whoever packed your parcel\r\nhas taken care that there shall be pieces enough, if no specimens! They\r\nwere in longer paper than the other bundles; not protected by binder’s\r\nboard, and therefore both ends, for two or three inches, were nicely\r\nbent up against the ends of the shorter bundle next them; which was very\r\npretty for the shape of the parcel, but death to many of the plants; for\r\nthe fold came just below the heads in most cases, too many of which were\r\ndecapitated like the victims of the (last but two) French revolution.\r\n\r\nI have been going on with recitations for some time, twice a week (two\r\nhours), and to-day I began my lectures to the whole Junior class, on\r\nGeographical Botany for the present.\r\n\r\nWhat with these duties, superintending gardener, and painting and\r\npapering in the house, and Sprague drawing for the second volume of\r\n“Genera,” and I printing the first, with the printer ever on my heels\r\nfor copy, and at the same time printing Memoirs and Proceedings of the\r\nAcademy, and managing large correspondence, you may conceive that my\r\nhands are full.\r\n\r\nYours most cordially,\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 2d May, 1848.\r\n\r\nI send ... a copy (roughly put into paper covers) of the first volume of\r\n“Genera Illustrata,” regretting there is not time to send you a bound\r\ncopy. I hope you will like it. Sprague is improving fast, reads Brown’s\r\npapers, etc., and is getting a good insight into structural botany, even\r\nthe nicest points. We mean to carry on the work, and I hope for\r\nconsiderable London sale of it. The price is $6, or in London, £1 10s.,\r\nwhich I trust will be thought low. Please notice it in the “Journal.”\r\nThe proceeds go principally to support Sprague in carrying on the work.\r\nI put his name on the title-page without his knowledge and at the\r\nexpense of his great modesty.\r\n\r\nI want to introduce the tussock grass on our eastern coast, where it\r\nwill thrive well. Is it too late to send this spring? Or will you send\r\nin autumn?\r\n\r\nP. S.--The last steamer brought good news of peace and strength in\r\nEngland, dissipating the alarm of many, but I felt none myself, having a\r\nstrong confidence in the soundness of Old England and the durability of\r\nher institutions, of which I am here esteemed an over admirer.\r\n\r\nDr. Gray was married, May 4, 1848, to Jane L., daughter of Charles\r\nGreely Loring, a lawyer in Boston. In June they made a short journey to\r\nWashington, that Dr. Gray might, on undertaking to describe the plants\r\nof the United States Exploring Expedition, see Commodore Wilkes.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, 8th May, 1848.\r\n\r\nYesterday I sent to Grant at Wiley’s for you a parcel containing some\r\n“Linnæas,” etc., received from Hamburg, your copy of Seubert on Elatine,\r\nand a bound copy of the “Genera Floræ Americæ Boreali-Orientalis\r\nIllustrata,” which I ask you to accept, and which I trust you will like.\r\nThere is also a specimen inclosed of some vegetable product that has\r\nlately become somewhat common here, and which I thought you might like\r\nto examine. It is apparently of a rather complicated structure, in fruit\r\nevidently, but syncarpous; the heterogenous and baccate or fleshy\r\novaries being immersed without apparent order in a farinaceous\r\nreceptacle. If you should be at all puzzled. with it, and can’t find out\r\nto what particular family it belongs, you might call in the aid of Mrs.\r\nTorrey and the girls, to aid in the investigation. I dare say you will\r\nmake it out.\r\n\r\nJune, 1848.\r\n\r\nI am just home this morning, and as I had no time yesterday to reply to\r\nyour kind letter of Saturday, I write at once now....\r\n\r\nFriday evening we were at the White house, to see Madame Polk. We have\r\naccomplished a great deal of sight-seeing and all in our week and a day,\r\nand J.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BOTANIC GARDEN HOUSE IN 1852]\r\n\r\nhas enjoyed it much, except the drawback of not seeing Mrs. T. and the\r\ngirls and yourself at home, which she greatly wished....\r\n\r\nNow as to Exploring Expedition. We will talk it over in full when you\r\ncome on here toward the end of this month.\r\n\r\nSuffice it to say (as I am pressed for time) that I had made up my mind\r\nwhat I would do it for before I left home; that on looking over the\r\ncollection, as to various parts of it, as far as time allowed, I found\r\nit less ample than I supposed, but with many difficulties owing to\r\nspecimens in fruit only, or flower only. I think it no very awful job,\r\nif done in the way I propose, which is, not by monographs by people\r\nabroad, which the committee will not agree to, but by working up a part\r\nabroad in Hooker’s, or Bentham’s, or Garden of Plants herbarium.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the committee and Wilkes behaved very well, and told me\r\nthey were very desirous I should take it up.\r\n\r\nOn Friday evening Wilkes came in, before we went to the President’s;\r\nasked me to say what I would do. I told him at once what I would do\r\n(just what I had told J. before we left Cambridge), and Wilkes at once\r\naccepted my terms, as I supposed he would. My terms were based on the\r\nsupposition that there is five years’ work in preparing for the press\r\nthe collections left on hand, and in superintending the printing....\r\n\r\nWe must settle together the typographical form of the work, etc., when\r\nyou come, and we will make the other writers conform to the plan we\r\nagree on, which perhaps you have already fixed.\r\n\r\nNow I want a careful and active curator. What young botanist can I\r\nget?...\r\n\r\n27th Nov., 1848.\r\n\r\nWright is up from Texas (with his mother at Wethersfield, Connecticut);\r\nhe will soon be here as curator to me, taking Lesquereux’s[154] place,\r\nwho has been with me a little, but now, as a consequence of his visit to\r\nColumbus, goes to aid Sullivant, with a provision that makes the truly\r\nworthy fellow perfectly happy. They will do up bryology at a great rate.\r\nLesquereux says that the collection and library of Sullivant in\r\nmuscology are “magnifique, superbe, the best he ever saw.”\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE ENGELMANN.\r\n\r\nJanuary 24, 1849.\r\n\r\nHalstead, I believe, has nearly decided to go on the Panama Railroad\r\nSurvey; I trust to get Wright attached to the boundary survey. I have a\r\nletter from Fendler, in which he expressed his willingness to go to the\r\nGreat Salt Lake country, if he can get government protection and food,\r\netc. In a few days I shall write to Marcy; send him the sheets of\r\n“Plantæ Fendlerianæ,” and make a vigorous application for this aid. No\r\ndoubt I shall get it, I think. But perhaps it might be almost as well\r\nfor Fendler to go over with a party of emigrants directly to Mormon\r\nCity. But probably there will be emigrants bound for the same place,\r\naccompanying the regiment, as near as they go. Fendler can do admirably\r\nwell in that region, if he perseveres. But will he not take the\r\ngold-fever and leave us in the lurch? Will not living, etc., be very\r\ndear in Mormon City also? I fear it. I must leave. much to your\r\ndiscretion. Only if you think Fendler has a strong tendency to\r\ngold-hunting (which few could resist) let him go. And afterwards, if he\r\nchooses to collect plants, very well. Few can withstand the temptation\r\nwhen fairly within the infected region, and we hear the Mormons have\r\nfound gold also....\r\n\r\nFebruary 25, 1849.\r\n\r\nI have just received from the secretary of war, Mr. Marcy, and inclose\r\nto you, what I think will procure all the facilities that Fendler can\r\nwish from United States troops. If, as I was informed, the secretary has\r\nno right to issue an order for rations to Fendler, he has certainly done\r\nthe best thing by issuing a recommendation which will, if the commander\r\nis favorably disposed, enable him to give all without any order. Indeed,\r\nI think we could ask nothing better....\r\n\r\nIn my haste, and multitude of business, I have shabbily neglected to\r\nsend the copies of “Plantæ Fendlerianæ” to Hamburg for Braun. And now\r\nthe Danes have blockaded the Elbe....\r\n\r\nI think I shall soon send the smaller things to you by express, and\r\nretain the three volumes of “Memoirs” for some opportunity less\r\nexpensive. We want railroad all the way to St. Louis.\r\n\r\nI am crowded--overwhelmed--with work. But college work will be over in\r\nJuly, and the second volume of “Genera,” which I am now hard at work on,\r\nwill soon be printed off; a week more and I shall have finished the\r\ncopy.\r\n\r\nI must then work at Exploring Expedition Compositæ, and soon at\r\nFendlerianæ, and (when the sets arrive) at Lindheimer’s, if you wish. I\r\nhave made a genus of the Texan Rue--between Ruta and Aplophyllum,--e.\r\ng., Rutosma. I think there are some good remarks you will like in the\r\nsecond volume of “Genera.”\r\n\r\nI foresee an unusually good chance to get rid of the college work a year\r\nhence, and must therefore try to overhaul the Exploring Expedition\r\nplants, so as to get them into some shape, and next year (May or April)\r\ngo abroad with them, sit down in London and Paris, and work them off. I\r\nwill then drum up subscribers for Fendler and Lindheimer.\r\n\r\nI want you to help me a little about Trees; our native trees up to\r\nCornus inclusive, for this year, for the report I have promised the\r\nSmithsonian Institution.[155] I wish I had a good assistant; one who\r\ncould work at botany. Perhaps I can find one abroad.\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TORREY.\r\n\r\nFebruary 26, 1849.\r\n\r\nHaving determined on an expedition for Wright, you may be sure I was not\r\ngoing to be altogether disappointed. Accordingly I have got one all\r\narranged (Lowell[156] and Greene subscribing handsomely) which is as\r\nmuch better than Emory’s as possible, and thus far everything has\r\nwonderfully conspired to favor it. Wright has left me this morning to go\r\nto his mother’s in Connecticut (Wethersfield); there to make his\r\nportfolios and presses; comes on to New York soon; takes first vessel\r\nfor Galveston (I expect a letter from Hastings telling when it sails),\r\nand to reach Austin and Fredericksburg in time to accompany the troops\r\nthat are about to be sent up, by a new road, across a new country, to El\r\nPaso, in New Mexico. Look on the map (Wislizenus) and you will see the\r\nregion we mean him to explore this summer; the hot valley of Rio del\r\nNorte, early in the season, the mountains east, and especially those\r\nwest in summer. He will probably stay two years, and get to Taos and\r\nSpanish Peaks this year or next. We shall have government\r\nrecommendations to protection, and letters to an officer (commanding)\r\nwho, through Henry, has already made overtures to collect himself or aid\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\n26th May, 1849.\r\n\r\nI have finished all the copy of “Genera Illustrata,” vol. ii., at\r\nlength; the printer has yet two or three sheets to set up. The plates\r\nare working off in New York. It will now soon be off my hands. It is\r\nlong since I have done anything at Exploring Expedition plants. I am now\r\ngoing at them. It is a shabby, unsatisfactory collection....\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, November 2, 1849.\r\n\r\n... Sorry I am that you could not be here while Harvey is here; he will\r\nhe south by Christmas. He desires me to say that he expects to spend the\r\nfirst half of December in New York at Dr. Hosack’s, and will be most\r\nglad to see you. I am sure you will like him. We are perfectly charmed\r\nwith him. A quiet, unaffected, pleasant man--extremely lovable. He works\r\naway at a table in my study. His course is a very interesting one. He is\r\na beautiful writer, but not very fluent extempore, though with more\r\npractice he would be a fine lecturer. He has a good audience....\r\n\r\nSprague has promised now to take up and finish your quarto drawings. He\r\nsays he can work but a little while at a time, from a difficulty of\r\nbreathing. Had I foreseen his health and vigor giving way, I should not\r\nhave undertaken the Trees, which, as to illustrations (as he is more\r\nfond of them than of anything else, and has made fine drawings), we have\r\ngradually enlarged our ideas about them much beyond the original plan,\r\nas to the figures. He must get this volume off his hands this winter,\r\nanyhow. The “Genera” will lie in abeyance....\r\n\r\nMy plan is only to bring out one volume of the Tree-Report next spring,\r\nand not to go beyond the limits of the United States proper, those of\r\n“Genera Illustrata,” except to mention the trees of the far West in a\r\ngeneral way; otherwise it would be far too formidable....\r\n\r\nSir John Richardson dropped in on me the very day Harvey arrived,\r\nexpressed regret he could not see you, learned here the rumored news of\r\nFranklin. I wish you could have been here at a little dinner party we\r\nmade for them. He is at home by this time.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nDecember 3, 1849.\r\n\r\n... We are glad to hear what fine discoveries your son is making in\r\nThibet, etc.\r\n\r\nI saw to-day for the first time, at Green’s, the Himalaya\r\nRhododendrons....\r\n\r\nI have just parted from Harvey, who has passed seven weeks with us, and\r\nhaving finished his course at the Lowell with much acceptance now joins\r\nhis friends at New York and Philadelphia till Christmas, and then goes\r\nsouth to Florida, Alabama, and probably either to Jamaica (where Dr.\r\nAlexander now is) or to the mountains at the St. Iago end of Cuba, a\r\nterra incognita nearly. Harvey is a most winning man; my wife and I have\r\nbecome extremely attached to him, and are sorry to part with him.\r\n\r\nWe do not mean to let any naturalist be idle who comes to this country,\r\nso he is already engaged to give illustrations of our peculiar Algæ for\r\nthe Smithsonian contributions and to prepare (after his return home, of\r\ncourse) a manual of United States Algæ after the fashion of his second\r\nedition of “British Algæ.” There will be no small demand for it....\r\n\r\nP. S.--Mr. Wright got through to El Paso in southern New Mexico, and is\r\non his way back, with, he says, a fine collection.\r\n\r\nWe got some fine daguerreotypes of Harvey, so much better, he says, than\r\nhe has seen in England that he has had an extra one taken for Lady\r\nHooker.\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE BENTHAM.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, January 7, 1850.\r\n\r\nYour letter of December 4th and your very flattering article in the\r\nDecember number of “Hooker’s Journal” were both most gratifying; and the\r\nremarks on the Mimosa were timely, as I was just about consigning the\r\nmanuscript of the earlier part of the new “Plantæ Lindheimerianæ” to the\r\nprinter. I like what you say about “deduplication” much, and freely\r\naccept almost all. I took the name coined to my hand, not feeling at\r\nliberty to coin a new one. I think the production of new organs one\r\nbefore the other can be pretty well explained morphologically and\r\nanatomically, in accordance with your hint, and shall attempt to work it\r\nout in the third edition of my “Botanical Text-Book,” which I am now\r\npreparing for the press. I shall be most glad of any further hints.\r\n\r\nMay I ask you what you think of Adrien de Jussieu’s way of explaining\r\nthe regular alternation of organs in the flower? I greatly incline to\r\nit....\r\n\r\nI have to finish this Lindheimer collection, finish Fendler’s,\r\ndistribute and study Wright’s collection when I get it, carry the\r\n“Botanical Text-Book” through the press, rewriting and expanding it\r\n(thus far I have made it all over), write the first volume of an\r\nelaborate report on the Trees of United States for the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, in fact a Sylva, with colored plates by Sprague (which I\r\ncould not resist taking in hand, as that institution promised to bring\r\nit out, and handsomely, at their expense), and give my course of\r\nlectures in the college from March to June. When all this is done I can\r\ncross the Atlantic.... By engaging a brother professor to take the\r\nduties which I have for the autumn term (assigning to him pro rata from\r\nmy salary), I shall be free until 1st March ensuing. But I mean to ask\r\nfor leave of absence for a year, and trust I shall get it....\r\n\r\nAs far as it has yet shaped itself my plan is ... to sit down hard to\r\nwork for the autumn and winter on the Exploring Expedition plants, to go\r\nto Paris in the spring and settle such questions as must be settled\r\nthere after I come to know better than I now do (except in the\r\nCompositæ) what they are. Excepting the Oregon and Californian plants,\r\nwhich are assigned to Torrey, and the Sandwich Islands Collection, a\r\nfine one, the collection is a poor one, often very meagre in specimens,\r\ntoo much of an alongshore and roadside collection to be of great\r\ninterest. I am not familiar with tropical forms and have no great love\r\nfor them. I dislike to take the time to study out laboriously and\r\nguessingly, with incomplete specimens, and no great herbaria and\r\nlibraries to refer to, these things which are mostly well known to\r\nbotanists, though not to me, and I want to be taken off from North\r\nAmerican botany for as short a time as possible. I must therefore come\r\nabroad with them, which the pay that is offered will enable me to do. I\r\nhave found a good deal to interest me in the Compositæ, especially those\r\nof Rio Negro, of north Patagonia and of the Andes of Peru....\r\n\r\nNow, will you take it as a bore, an imposition on your kindness, if I\r\nfrankly ask whether I can possibly offer you any sort of inducement to\r\naid me, at least so far as to run over the collections with me, and name\r\nthose that are familiar to you as we pass, and refer others, as nearly\r\nas one can without study, to their proper places? Your mere comments in\r\nrunning through would save half my time.\r\n\r\nIt is most natural that you should not incline to any such trouble, and\r\nI know your hands are always full; so, if you say no, I shall feel it is\r\nquite right, and do the best I can....\r\n\r\nWe shall be most glad to visit you at Pontrilas house at whatever time\r\nbest suits Mrs. Bentham and yourself, whether in summer or in autumn,\r\nany time before we settle down into our winter quarters....\r\n\r\nWith best wishes to Mrs. B. and yourself for the new year, I am very\r\nfaithfully yours,\r\n\r\nA. GRAY.\r\n\r\nTO W. J. HOOKER.\r\n\r\nApril 2, 1850.\r\n\r\nWe were most glad to receive your kind favor of January 29, which,\r\nhowever, lay over a fortnight in England, and in the mean time we heard\r\nnot only of Dr. Hooker’s capture, but also, with much gratification, of\r\nhis release. What an indefatigable man he is!\r\n\r\nFinding myself greatly behindhand, on account of various hindrances and\r\nmiscalculation of time, and utterly unable to accomplish half the work I\r\nhad intended to do this spring, I have decided to break off; and to\r\nsail, in a packet-ship from Boston, on the 5th of June, with Mrs. Gray,\r\nfor Liverpool, which we may hope to reach by the close of that month.\r\nThis will give us an opportunity of seeing England in its summer dress,\r\nand to make, almost immediately following the sea voyage, a trip up the\r\nRhine to Switzerland. On our return I must set to work diligently, and\r\nfor a little while with Mr. Bentham, who has kindly offered to look over\r\nthe tropical collections, which I know little of, and love as little.\r\n\r\nThe rewriting of all the structural parts of my 3d edition of the\r\n“Botanical Text-Book,” which I was inadvertently drawn into, has proved\r\na most time-consuming business. It is not yet through the press.\r\n\r\nWright’s collection of seeds I had divided into two parts, and I send\r\nyou one by the hands of Mr. Lowell, who with his whole family goes out\r\nby this steamer. You will receive them in good time to raise them....\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell is of great use to us, in helping on these explorations, and\r\nI look to his visit to Europe, the sight of the great collections, and\r\nthe society of naturalists to strengthen his tastes and fire his zeal in\r\nthese respects.\r\n\r\nI long to have him and Mrs. Lowell, a very good. friend of ours, make\r\nyour acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n [1] This colony was composed of rigid Presbyterians, who desired\r\n to leave Ireland to escape various persecutions. They sent out the\r\n Rev. Mr. Boyd, early in 1718, with an address to the Governor of\r\n Massachusetts. The address, now in the Archives of the New Hampshire\r\n Historical Society, was signed by three hundred and nineteen persons,\r\n nine of whom were clergymen. The report brought back by Mr. Boyd of\r\n his reception by the governor and of the prospects of the country was\r\n so favorable that the addressors converted their property into money,\r\n and embarked in five ships for Boston, which they reached August 4,\r\n 1718. In Boston they separated for different places, but the larger\r\n part were sent to Worcester, then a frontier settlement of fifty-eight\r\n dwellings and two hundred inhabitants, but needing a larger population\r\n as protection from the Indians. John Gray--there were two of his name\r\n in the original party--went to Worcester, where he owned considerable\r\n land, and was evidently a man of influence in the colony, to judge\r\n from the various public offices held by him.\r\n\r\n [2] Robert Gray, one of John Gray’s sons, was twenty years old when\r\n he came to America. There is a tradition in the family that the\r\n acquaintance and courtship began on the voyage.\r\n\r\n [3] Sauquoit was a settlement in the eastern part of the town of\r\n Paris, the township so named in grateful recognition of a supply\r\n of food, sent by a Mr. Paris, of Oswego, at a time when the early\r\n settlers were near starving.--A. G.\r\n\r\n [4] Moses Gray was the eighth child,--a boy and a girl were born\r\n later,--and one step-brother, Watson, survived Moses Gray. Moses Wiley\r\n Gray made the journey to Sauquoit, on horseback, taking before him\r\n his son Moses, then a boy of eight. The Mohawk Valley at this time\r\n was the far West, with only slow and tedious communication beyond\r\n Schenectady, but opening, in its lovely tributary valleys, tempting\r\n regions of hill and valley, well wooded, with clear, sparkling\r\n streams. The land offered good farming opportunities when cleared of\r\n trees, and the rapid streams gave good promise of water power. Here\r\n Moses Wiley Gray took a farm on the top of a hill, and cultivated the\r\n land for ten years. He was injured by the fall of a tree, and his leg\r\n was amputated. He died the next day, May 8, 1803, leaving his son\r\n Moses, with his stepmother and her children largely dependent on his\r\n assistance.\r\n\r\n [5] She was married in 1788.\r\n\r\n [6] The house is still standing which, built in 1648 by an ancestor of\r\n Ralph Waldo Emerson, was bought by William Howard, in 1669.\r\n\r\n [7] Asa’s mother was but four years old, when the family moved to\r\n Sauquoit, and well remembered her mother’s crying at the crossing of\r\n the Hudson River, which must have seemed formidable in the small boats\r\n of that time. Joseph Howard was a man of a very lovable character, as\r\n shown from the affectionate remembrances of him by his grandchildren,\r\n the eldest of whom, Asa, was much with him. He was a deacon of the\r\n First Church in Sauquoit for forty years, and one of the leading men\r\n in the town. He died in 1849.\r\n\r\n [8] Moses Gray was a man of great activity and energy. He soon added\r\n a shoe-shop to his tannery, where he hired a few hands to make shoes\r\n from the hides he tanned, taking these again by wagon to Albany, a\r\n journey of many days, where he bought his skins and some necessary\r\n supplies. Money was scarce in the newly settled country, and the\r\n things needed were mostly got by exchange. Meantime, as the chance\r\n came, he was buying land on the hills around. Clayville is where the\r\n valley narrows towards the source of the Sauquoit Creek, as “rivers”\r\n are called in that neighborhood in old Dutch fashion, and the hills\r\n are sharper and rougher. The scenery, however, is still beautiful,\r\n and the house which Moses Gray built two or three years later yet\r\n stands, with a lovely near view of stream and hill and wood. Asa\r\n Gray remembered his father building it. Busy as the father was out\r\n of doors, the mother was perhaps busier still. Asa, the younger\r\n brother by the first wife, was dying of consumption; he was moved on\r\n a bed from Sauquoit to Paris Furnace, and died very soon after, in\r\n May, 1811, aged twenty-three. When the child was born, November 18,\r\n 1810, it was carried to him to see, and he said he wished they would\r\n call it Asa, if it had had no name as yet decided on. He was of a\r\n singularly sweet and gentle character. The step-brothers were taken\r\n in turn to be taught and trained. The hands employed on farm or in\r\n trade were generally lodged and boarded. Often their clothes were\r\n mended or made. The wheat and grain were home-raised, as were all\r\n the vegetables. There was little fresh meat, except when a sheep or\r\n beef was killed, and that meant salting and curing. Butter and cheese\r\n were all homemade, and could be taken to Albany for sale, as was also\r\n grain; as the farm grew, more cows were added. Then the clothing\r\n was homemade. The wool for flannel sheets and underclothing and for\r\n the men’s clothes was home-spun, the nicer portions taken off and\r\n carded separately, and spun as worsted for the children’s and women’s\r\n dresses; also the yarn for socks for the whole family. A spinning-girl\r\n was hired for part of the year, for flax was also spun for the house\r\n linen and for wearing-apparel. The weaving was hired out. The tailor\r\n came by the week to make up the clothing with the mother’s help, and\r\n after the tannery was given up, the shoe-maker came at intervals to\r\n make the shoes. As the girls grew older they took their share at the\r\n wool and flax wheels. It is said that the first spinning of flax on\r\n the small wheel was introduced by the party of Scotch-Irish emigrants\r\n of 1718; that the women gave lessons to the women of Boston on Boston\r\n Common, and the fashion was so set for that spinning. It is also said\r\n that the Irish potato was first introduced into New England by these\r\n same colonists.\r\n\r\n A widowed sister came with her children to make her home under the\r\n same roof when the Grays moved later to a larger farm, and there\r\n seemed always some boy to be housed and taught and trained. Though\r\n his aid might tell out of doors, the home care came upon the mother.\r\n But Mrs. Gray was a woman of singularly quiet and gentle character,\r\n with great strength and decision, and possessed a wonderful power of\r\n accomplishing and turning off work; a woman of thoughtful, earnest\r\n ways, conscientious and self-forgetting.\r\n\r\n The father was quick, decided, and an immense worker; from him the\r\n son took his lively movements and his quick eagerness of character,\r\n perhaps also his ready appreciation of fun.\r\n\r\n [9] His mother, having another child, was probably glad to have the\r\n active boy safe for a few hours. Her young sisters lived not far away,\r\n and the youngest aunt, a girl of ten, was proud to take him to school;\r\n she had already taught him his letters. His father promised him a\r\n spelling-book of his own as soon as he reached _baker_, which was a\r\n marked spot of advance in the spelling-book. A few weeks saw him far\r\n enough on, and the coveted prize was given. He went proudly to school\r\n the next day, and as he could not speak to the teacher to proclaim\r\n his triumph, he walked in front of her desk to his seat, waving the\r\n book with a great flourish before her! It was just before he was three\r\n years old.\r\n\r\n [10] Of one of these, his friend, now over eighty years old, gives an\r\n account in the succeeding letter:--\r\n\r\nSAUQUOIT, _February 19, 1888_.\r\n\r\n DEAR A.--I would like to give you some information of your uncle’s\r\n early life if I were well informed, but, I have only one little\r\n incident, and perhaps that would be of small account at the present\r\n era, though at the time it took place it was of great moment to us\r\n both as children. Asa lived with his parents at Paris Furnace, now\r\n Clayville. I lived where Mr. Bragg afterward built his new house.\r\n Well, we had a lovely teacher that summer by the name of Sally\r\n Stickney, living at Colonel Avery’s. She ruled by gentleness. For our\r\n class she had an old-fashioned two-shilling piece, with a hole through\r\n to insert a yard of blue ribbon. She put this over the head of the one\r\n that stood first in our class. So it traveled every night, all that\r\n summer, with some one of us, until the ribbon was worn and faded. But\r\n more than all that, the one that stood at the head on the last day\r\n of school was to be the owner of that two-shilling piece that we had\r\n watched with jealous eyes so many weeks, and studied Webster’s old\r\n spelling-book so hard to gain. I think our eyes must have magnified\r\n it, for I have never seen a coin since that seemed so large. I think\r\n it was the same in Asa’s eyes. Well, with hearts beating fast, and\r\n eyes on the coveted prize, we were called on the last day of school\r\n to spell; we took our places; I was at the head, Asa next. I missed\r\n and he went above me; my all was gone, but it was worse to have him\r\n point his finger at me and say out loud “kee-e-e.” I braved it without\r\n a tear; a few more words would end the strife. It came around to\r\n him, and he missed; how quick I went above him; but in an instant he\r\n dropped his head on the desk before him and wept as though his heart\r\n would break. School was dismissed, scholars were leaving; still he\r\n did not move, until our kind teacher came to him, whispered to him,\r\n soothed and petted him; then he jumped up and ran, I suppose wishing\r\n me in Halifax. I felt sorry for him and would have been willing to\r\n divide with him if he had not crowed over me so. I ran nearly all\r\n the way home--a good mile--with my treasure, in great haste to have\r\n some one tell me the best way to invest my money. I was told to go\r\n another three quarters of a mile to Stephen Savage’s store, spend it\r\n for calico, piece it up, to keep forever. I could get only one yard\r\n for my two-shilling piece, not nearly as good as can be bought now for\r\n three cents a yard. Not a trace of the quilt is left, nor of the old\r\n schoolhouse, or of those merry children; perhaps a few have wandered\r\n on to fourscore years. So it is little I can relate of his childhood,\r\n as the next year we moved from that district, but as years passed on I\r\n often heard of his rising fame with pleasure. If Eli Avery were living\r\n he would have been his best biographer in this place.\r\n\r\n The time has flown so fast since all this transpired, it seems as if\r\n his tears had hardly dried before my grandchildren were studying his\r\n Botanies.\r\n\r\n Two years ago the 9th day of September, when the doctor was visiting\r\n in Sauquoit, he called here and remarked, in his smiling way, “that he\r\n had got all over feeling badly about _that_.” I said, “And well you\r\n may when you have received so many honors since then.”\r\n\r\nYour loving friend,\r\n\r\nHARRIET ROGERS.\r\n\r\n A neighbor who survived to a great age also told a story of Dr. Gray’s\r\n boyhood, which he said he had from Dr. Gray’s father:--\r\n\r\n One day he had been set to hoe a certain amount of corn, and his\r\n father found him reading instead of at his work. He gave him his\r\n choice, to finish his task and then read comfortably, or to sit there\r\n in the field all day in the hot sun, which one knows is no pleasant\r\n thing in August, and read. He chose the reading, and his father said\r\n then, “I made up my mind he might make something of a scholar, but he\r\n would never make a farmer!” And so his farther education was decided.\r\n\r\n [11] Asa Gray was the eldest of eight children, three sisters and four\r\n brothers, of whom there survive two sisters and two brothers.\r\n\r\n [12] Dr. Gray visited Fairfield again in the summer of 1860 or 1861.\r\n He pointed out his old room, and told about some of the pranks he and\r\n his room-mate Eli Avery had played there as boys, especially once\r\n when they barred their room, escaped through the window by clambering\r\n down a rope, and then enjoyed the efforts of the master to break the\r\n door down. Oddly enough there was then a fresh panel in the door, as\r\n if a later generation had tried the same trick. There were a great\r\n many stories told of his exploits as a boy. But he said everything\r\n had been fathered upon him, and that few were really true. He was no\r\n doubt restless and active, and learning quickly and easily would have\r\n leisure for some mischief, but he said, “I always learned my lessons.”\r\n He loved to recall the long rambles through the woods on Saturday\r\n holidays, and how in early spring he and his companions would climb\r\n to a lookout and see where columns of smoke could be seen above the\r\n trees, and so aim for the spot where they were making maple sugar.\r\n There they would beg a little syrup, and, boiling it down over their\r\n own fire and cooling it on snow, make a candy more delicious than any\r\n confectionery of after life. He remembered how he trained himself to\r\n know the trees by their bark as he ran through the woods, without\r\n looking up at the leaves, having then the keen power of observation\r\n though no especial interest in botany. For, as he always said, his\r\n first fancy was for mineralogy rather than for botany.\r\n\r\n And he told how when he was a medical student, as so many about him\r\n were smoking, he tried it too; it made him very sick at first, and\r\n took him some time to get accustomed to it. At last, as he sat one\r\n evening before the fire and smoked, he said to himself, “Really, I am\r\n beginning to like it. It will become a habit; I shall be dependent\r\n upon it.” And so he threw his cigar into the fire and gave up smoking\r\n entirely.\r\n\r\n [13] In later life the novels were always saved for long journeys. The\r\n novel of the day was picked out, and one pleasure of a long day’s ride\r\n in the train was to sit by his side and enjoy his pleasure at the good\r\n things. The glee and delight with which he read Hawthorne, especially\r\n the _Wonder-Book_ and _Tanglewood Tales_, make days to remember. So he\r\n read George Eliot, and Adam Bede carried him happily through a fit of\r\n the toothache. Scott always remained the prime favorite, and his last\r\n day of reading, when the final illness was stealing so unexpectedly\r\n and insidiously on, was spent over _The Monastery_, which he had been\r\n planning to read on his homeward voyage in 1887.\r\n\r\n [14] It was established as a college in 1812, having existed as a\r\n school in the academy since 1809. There were then only five others\r\n in the United Stated: Philadelphia, New York, Boston, Dartmouth,\r\n and Baltimore. The war of 1812 with Great Britain made a demand for\r\n army surgeons along the frontier, and New York and Boston were too\r\n far to send the young men to be educated. Dr. Hadley was professor\r\n in the literary academy, and Dr. Willoughby, who had a wide medical\r\n reputation, was also in Fairfield. They planned a medical college, and\r\n applied to the legislature for aid; the sum of $5,000 was granted,\r\n and later, in 1812, $10,000. The first Faculty was organized by the\r\n Board of Regents of the New York State University, which had control\r\n of the educational institutions in the State. It grew rapidly in\r\n favor, and soon outnumbered the schools of the large cities. In 1820\r\n the school had one hundred students, and increased to two hundred and\r\n seventeen later, and was the largest medical school in the country,\r\n except the one at Philadelphia. After the Albany and Geneva medical\r\n schools were established, it was seen there was no need of three so\r\n near together, and Fairfield Medical College was discontinued in 1840.\r\n In the list of graduates of Fairfield Academy were Albert Barnes,\r\n the noted expositor, General Halleck, of the United States Army,\r\n and James Hadley, professor of Greek at Yale and the distinguished\r\n linguist. In the records of the academy it is stated that “Asa Gray\r\n entered Fairfield Academy in the fall of 1825, and at the second\r\n weekly meeting joined the Calliopean Society of the institute. His\r\n handwriting on the register is still preserved, as well as all his\r\n doings as a boy while here, since he entered at an early age, being\r\n in fact much younger than the majority of the students.” He graduated\r\n from the medical college January 25, 1831 in a class of forty-four.\r\n His rank was seventeen in the class on graduation. The subject of his\r\n thesis was “Gastritis.” Two old catalogues are preserved at Fairfield.\r\n In the first there is the programme of studies at the academy for the\r\n year 1826; the other, dating January, 1832, contains a list of the\r\n professors of the medical college, the cost of instruction, and the\r\n outlines of two courses of lectures. One of them was given by Dr.\r\n Mather, who was a fellow student of Asa Gray’s, and who still, at over\r\n eighty, retains a lively recollection of the eager, active young man\r\n whom his friends already thought would make his mark in the world;\r\n the other by Dr. Gray himself. This was one of the first courses of\r\n lectures which he delivered. The ticket-fee was four dollars. He\r\n kept through life a certain love for medicine and surgery, and a\r\n lively interest in its science and progress. These old studies and\r\n the country practice he had with the physician who was always his\r\n good friend, Dr. Trowbridge, often served him on his journeys, when a\r\n regular practitioner was not within easy reach.\r\n\r\n [15] Amos Eaton, 1776-1842. Graduated from Williams in 1799.

His first botanical publication was a catalogue of the plants on\r\n the island of New York, in 1810. He later wrote chiefly on entomology.\r\n\r\n [20] It appears that in December, 1834, I read to the Lyceum of\r\n Natural History my first paper, _Monograph of North American\r\n Rhynchosporæ_, and my second, _New or Rare Plants of the State of New\r\n York_. They must have been printed early in 1835.--A. G.\r\n\r\n [21] J. G. C.

Hooker said of it:--[It]\r\n “may fairly be classed among the most beautiful and useful works of\r\n the kind that we are acquainted with. The specimens are remarkably\r\n well selected, skillfully prepared, critically studied, and carefully\r\n compared with those in the extensive and very authentic herbarium of\r\n Dr. Torrey.”\r\n\r\n [29] Alluding to the then popular squib of Major Jack Downing’s\r\n letters.\r\n\r\n [30] S.
