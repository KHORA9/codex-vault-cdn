In the world of creatures, as in the\r\nworld of men, the story precedes and outlives history. There are many\r\ninstances of the fact that if an insect attract our attention for this\r\nreason or that, it is given a place in those legends of the people whose\r\nlast care is truth.\r\n\r\nFor example, who is there that does not, at least by hearsay, know the\r\nCigale? Where in the entomological world shall we find a more famous\r\nreputation? Her fame as an impassioned singer, careless of the future,\r\nwas the subject of our earliest lessons in repetition. In short, easily\r\nremembered lines of verse, we learned how she was destitute when the\r\nwinter winds arrived, and how she went begging for food to the Ant, her\r\nneighbour. A poor welcome she received, the would-be borrower!--a\r\nwelcome that has become proverbial, and her chief title to celebrity.\r\nThe petty malice of the two short lines--\r\n\r\n  Vous chantiez! j'en suis bien aise,\r\n  Eh bien, dansez maintenant!\r\n\r\nhas done more to immortalise the insect than her skill as a musician.\r\n\"You sang! I am very glad to hear it! Now you can dance!\" The words\r\nlodge in the childish memory, never to be forgotten. To most\r\nEnglishmen--to most Frenchmen even--the song of the Cigale is unknown,\r\nfor she dwells in the country of the olive-tree; but we all know of the\r\ntreatment she received at the hands of the Ant. On such trifles does\r\nFame depend! A legend of very dubious value, its moral as bad as its\r\nnatural history; a nurse's tale whose only merit is its brevity; such is\r\nthe basis of a reputation which will survive the wreck of centuries no\r\nless surely than the tale of Puss-in-Boots and of Little Red\r\nRiding-Hood.\r\n\r\nThe child is the best guardian of tradition, the great conservative.\r\nCustom and tradition become indestructible when confided to the archives\r\nof his memory. To the child we owe the celebrity of the Cigale, of whose\r\nmisfortunes he has babbled during his first lessons in recitation. It is\r\nhe who will preserve for future generations the absurd nonsense of which\r\nthe body of the fable is constructed; the Cigale will always be hungry\r\nwhen the cold comes, although there were never Cigales in winter; she\r\nwill always beg alms in the shape of a few grains of wheat, a diet\r\nabsolutely incompatible with her delicate capillary \"tongue\"; and in\r\ndesperation she will hunt for flies and grubs, although she never eats.\r\n\r\nWhom shall we hold responsible for these strange mistakes? La Fontaine,\r\nwho in most of his fables charms us with his exquisite fineness of\r\nobservation, has here been ill-inspired. His earlier subjects he knew\r\ndown to the ground: the Fox, the Wolf, the Cat, the Stag, the Crow, the\r\nRat, the Ferret, and so many others, whose actions and manners he\r\ndescribes with a delightful precision of detail. These are inhabitants\r\nof his own country; neighbours, fellow-parishioners. Their life, private\r\nand public, is lived under his eyes; but the Cigale is a stranger to the\r\nhaunts of Jack Rabbit. La Fontaine had never seen nor heard her. For him\r\nthe celebrated songstress was certainly a grasshopper.\r\n\r\nGrandville, whose pencil rivals the author's pen, has fallen into the\r\nsame error. In his illustration to the fable we see the Ant dressed like\r\na busy housewife. On her threshold, beside her full sacks of wheat, she\r\ndisdainfully turns her back upon the would-be borrower, who holds out\r\nher claw--pardon, her hand. With a wide coachman's hat, a guitar under\r\nher arm, and a skirt wrapped about her knees by the gale, there stands\r\nthe second personage of the fable, the perfect portrait of a\r\ngrasshopper. Grandville knew no more than La Fontaine of the true\r\nCigale; he has beautifully expressed the general confusion.\r\n\r\nBut La Fontaine, in this abbreviated history, is only the echo of\r\nanother fabulist. The legend of the Cigale and the cold welcome of the\r\nAnt is as old as selfishness: as old as the world. The children of\r\nAthens, going to school with their baskets of rush-work stuffed with\r\nfigs and olives, were already repeating the story under their breath, as\r\na lesson to be repeated to the teacher. \"In winter,\" they used to say,\r\n\"the Ants were putting their damp food to dry in the sun. There came a\r\nstarving Cigale to beg from them. She begged for a few grains. The\r\ngreedy misers replied: 'You sang in the summer, now dance in the\r\nwinter.'\" This, although somewhat more arid, is precisely La Fontaine's\r\nstory, and is contrary to the facts.\r\n\r\nYet the story comes to us from Greece, which is, like the South of\r\nFrance, the home of the olive-tree and the Cigale. Was Æsop really its\r\nauthor, as tradition would have it? It is doubtful, and by no means a\r\nmatter of importance; at all events, the author was a Greek, and a\r\ncompatriot of the Cigale, which must have been perfectly familiar to\r\nhim. There is not a single peasant in my village so blind as to be\r\nunaware of the total absence of Cigales in winter; and every tiller of\r\nthe soil, every gardener, is familiar with the first phase of the\r\ninsect, the larva, which his spade is perpetually discovering when he\r\nbanks up the olives at the approach of the cold weather, and he knows,\r\nhaving seen it a thousand times by the edge of the country paths, how in\r\nsummer this larva issues from the earth from a little round well of its\r\nown making; how it climbs a twig or a stem of grass, turns upon its\r\nback, climbs out of its skin, drier now than parchment, and becomes the\r\nCigale; a creature of a fresh grass-green colour which is rapidly\r\nreplaced by brown.\r\n\r\nWe cannot suppose that the Greek peasant was so much less intelligent\r\nthan the Provençal that he can have failed to see what the least\r\nobservant must have noticed. He knew what my rustic neighbours know so\r\nwell. The scribe, whoever he may have been, who was responsible for the\r\nfable was in the best possible circumstances for correct knowledge of\r\nthe subject. Whence, then, arose the errors of his tale?\r\n\r\nLess excusably than La Fontaine, the Greek fabulist wrote of the Cigale\r\nof the books, instead of interrogating the living Cigale, whose cymbals\r\nwere resounding on every side; careless of the real, he followed\r\ntradition. He himself echoed a more ancient narrative; he repeated some\r\nlegend that had reached him from India, the venerable mother of\r\ncivilisations. We do not know precisely what story the reed-pen of the\r\nHindoo may have confided to writing, in order to show the perils of a\r\nlife without foresight; but it is probable that the little animal drama\r\nwas nearer the truth than the conversation between the Cigale and the\r\nAnt. India, the friend of animals, was incapable of such a mistake.\r\nEverything seems to suggest that the principal personage of the original\r\nfable was not the Cigale of the Midi, but some other creature, an insect\r\nif you will, whose manners corresponded to the adopted text.\r\n\r\nImported into Greece, after long centuries during which, on the banks of\r\nthe Indus, it made the wise reflect and the children laugh, the ancient\r\nanecdote, perhaps as old as the first piece of advice that a father of a\r\nfamily ever gave in respect of economy, transmitted more or less\r\nfaithfully from one memory to another, must have suffered alteration in\r\nits details, as is the fate of all such legends, which the passage of\r\ntime adapts to the circumstance of time and place.\r\n\r\nThe Greek, not finding in his country the insect of which the Hindoo\r\nspoke, introduced the Cigale, as in Paris, the modern Athens, the Cigale\r\nhas been replaced by the Grasshopper. The mistake was made; henceforth\r\nindelible. Entrusted as it is to the memory of childhood, error will\r\nprevail against the truth that lies before our eyes.\r\n\r\nLet us seek to rehabilitate the songstress so calumniated by the fable.\r\nShe is, I grant you, an importunate neighbour. Every summer she takes up\r\nher station in hundreds before my door, attracted thither by the verdure\r\nof two great plane-trees; and there, from sunrise to sunset, she hammers\r\non my brain with her strident symphony. With this deafening concert\r\nthought is impossible; the mind is in a whirl, is seized with vertigo,\r\nunable to concentrate itself. If I have not profited by the early\r\nmorning hours the day is lost.\r\n\r\nAh! Creature possessed, the plague of my dwelling, which I hoped would\r\nbe so peaceful!--the Athenians, they say, used to hang you up in a\r\nlittle cage, the better to enjoy your song. One were well enough, during\r\nthe drowsiness of digestion; but hundreds, roaring all at once,\r\nassaulting the hearing until thought recoils--this indeed is torture!\r\nYou put forward, as excuse, your rights as the first occupant. Before my\r\narrival the two plane-trees were yours without reserve; it is I who have\r\nintruded, have thrust myself into their shade. I confess it: yet muffle\r\nyour cymbals, moderate your arpeggi, for the sake of your historian! The\r\ntruth rejects what the fabulist tells us as an absurd invention. That\r\nthere are sometimes dealings between the Cigale and the Ant is perfectly\r\ncorrect; but these dealings are the reverse of those described in the\r\nfable. They depend not upon the initiative of the former; for the Cigale\r\nnever required the help of others in order to make her living: on the\r\ncontrary, they are due to the Ant, the greedy exploiter of others, who\r\nfills her granaries with every edible she can find. At no time does the\r\nCigale plead starvation at the doors of the ant-hills, faithfully\r\npromising a return of principal and interest; the Ant on the contrary,\r\nharassed by drought, begs of the songstress. Begs, do I say! Borrowing\r\nand repayment are no part of the manners of this land-pirate. She\r\nexploits the Cigale; she impudently robs her. Let us consider this\r\ntheft; a curious point of history as yet unknown.\r\n\r\nIn July, during the stifling hours of the afternoon, when the insect\r\npeoples, frantic with drought, wander hither and thither, vainly seeking\r\nto quench their thirst at the faded, exhausted flowers, the Cigale makes\r\nlight of the general aridity. With her rostrum, a delicate augur, she\r\nbroaches a cask of her inexhaustible store. Crouching, always singing,\r\non the twig of a suitable shrub or bush, she perforates the firm, glossy\r\nrind, distended by the sap which the sun has matured. Plunging her\r\nproboscis into the bung-hole, she drinks deliciously, motionless, and\r\nwrapt in meditation, abandoned to the charms of syrup and of song.\r\n\r\nLet us watch her awhile. Perhaps we shall witness unlooked-for\r\nwretchedness and want. For there are many thirsty creatures wandering\r\nhither and thither; and at last they discover the Cigale's private well,\r\nbetrayed by the oozing sap upon the brink. They gather round it, at\r\nfirst with a certain amount of constraint, confining themselves to\r\nlapping the extravasated liquor. I have seen, crowding around the\r\nhoneyed perforation, wasps, flies, earwigs, Sphinx-moths, Pompilidæ,\r\nrose-chafers, and, above all, ants.\r\n\r\nThe smallest, in order to reach the well, slip under the belly of the\r\nCigale, who kindly raises herself on her claws, leaving room for the\r\nimportunate ones to pass. The larger, stamping with impatience, quickly\r\nsnatch a mouthful, withdraw, take a turn on the neighbouring twigs, and\r\nthen return, this time more enterprising. Envy grows keener; those who\r\nbut now were cautious become turbulent and aggressive, and would\r\nwillingly drive from the spring the well-sinker who has caused it to\r\nflow.\r\n\r\nIn this crowd of brigands the most aggressive are the ants. I have seen\r\nthem nibbling the ends of the Cigale's claws; I have caught them tugging\r\nthe ends of her wings, climbing on her back, tickling her antennæ. One\r\naudacious individual so far forgot himself under my eyes as to seize her\r\nproboscis, endeavouring to extract it from the well!\r\n\r\nThus hustled by these dwarfs, and at the end of her patience, the\r\ngiantess finally abandons the well. She flies away, throwing a jet of\r\nliquid excrement over her tormentors as she goes. But what cares the Ant\r\nfor this expression of sovereign contempt? She is left in possession of\r\nthe spring--only too soon exhausted when the pump is removed that made\r\nit flow. There is little left, but that little is sweet. So much to the\r\ngood; she can wait for another drink, attained in the same manner, as\r\nsoon as the occasion presents itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DURING THE DROUGHTS OF SUMMER THIRSTING INSECTS, AND\r\nNOTABLY THE ANT, FLOCK TO THE DRINKING-PLACES OF THE CIGALE.]\r\n\r\nAs we see, reality completely reverses the action described by the\r\nfable. The shameless beggar, who does not hesitate at theft, is the Ant;\r\nthe industrious worker, willingly sharing her goods with the suffering,\r\nis the Cigale. Yet another detail, and the reversal of the fable is\r\nfurther emphasised. After five or six weeks of gaiety, the songstress\r\nfalls from the tree, exhausted by the fever of life. The sun shrivels\r\nher body; the feet of the passers-by crush it. A bandit always in search\r\nof booty, the Ant discovers the remains. She divides the rich find,\r\ndissects it, and cuts it up into tiny fragments, which go to swell her\r\nstock of provisions. It is not uncommon to see a dying Cigale, whose\r\nwings are still trembling in the dust, drawn and quartered by a gang of\r\nknackers. Her body is black with them. After this instance of\r\ncannibalism the truth of the relations between the two insects is\r\nobvious.\r\n\r\nAntiquity held the Cigale in high esteem. The Greek Béranger, Anacreon,\r\ndevoted an ode to her, in which his praise of her is singularly\r\nexaggerated. \"Thou art almost like unto the Gods,\" he says. The reasons\r\nwhich he has given for this apotheosis are none of the best. They\r\nconsist in these three privileges: [Greek: gêgenês, apathês,\r\nhanaimosarke]; born of the earth, insensible to pain, bloodless. We will\r\nnot reproach the poet for these mistakes; they were then generally\r\nbelieved, and were perpetuated long afterwards, until the exploring eye\r\nof scientific observation was directed upon them. And in minor poetry,\r\nwhose principal merit lies in rhythm and harmony, we must not look at\r\nthings too closely.\r\n\r\nEven in our days, the Provençal poets, who know the Cigale as Anacreon\r\nnever did, are scarcely more careful of the truth in celebrating the\r\ninsect which they have taken for their emblem. A friend of mine, an\r\neager observer and a scrupulous realist, does not deserve this reproach.\r\nHe gives me permission to take from his pigeon-holes the following\r\nProvençal poem, in which the relations between the Cigale and the Ant\r\nare expounded with all the rigour of science. I leave to him the\r\nresponsibility for his poetic images and his moral reflections, blossoms\r\nunknown to my naturalist's garden; but I can swear to the truth of all\r\nhe says, for it corresponds with what I see each summer on the\r\nlilac-trees of my garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n        LA CIGALO E LA FOURNIGO.\r\n\r\n                   I.\r\n\r\n  Jour de Dièu, queto caud!

God, what heat!\r\n     Half drunken with her joy, she feasts\r\n  In a hail of fire. Pays for the harvest meet;\r\n     A golden sea the reaper breasts,\r\n  Loins bent, throat bare; silent, he labours long,\r\n  For thirst within his throat has stilled the song.\r\n\r\n  A blessed time for thee, little Cigale.\r\n     Thy little cymbals shake and sound,\r\n  Shake, shake thy stomach till thy mirrors fall!\r\n     Man meanwhile swings his scythe around;\r\n  Continually back and forth it veers,\r\n  Flashing its steel amidst the ruddy ears.\r\n\r\n  Grass-plugged, with water for the grinder full,\r\n    A flask is hung upon his hip;\r\n  The stone within its wooden trough is cool,\r\n    Free all the day to sip and sip;\r\n  But man is gasping in the fiery sun,\r\n  That makes his very marrow melt and run.\r\n\r\n  Thou, Cigale, hast a cure for thirst: the bark,\r\n    Tender and juicy, of the bough.\r\n  Thy beak, a very needle, stabs it. Mark\r\n    The narrow passage welling now;\r\n  The sugared stream is flowing, thee beside,\r\n  Who drinkest of the flood, the honeyed tide.\r\n\r\n  Not in peace always; nay, for thieves arrive,\r\n    Neighbours and wives, or wanderers vile;\r\n  They saw thee sink the well, and ill they thrive\r\n    Thirsting; they seek to drink awhile;\r\n  Beauty, beware! the wallet-snatcher's face,\r\n  Humble at first, grows insolent apace.\r\n\r\n  They seek the merest drop; thy leavings take;\r\n    Soon discontent, their heads they toss;\r\n  They crave for all, and all will have. They rake\r\n    Their claws thy folded wings across;\r\n  Thy back a mountain, up and down each goes;\r\n  They seize thee by the beak, the horns, the toes.\r\n\r\n  This way and that they pull. Impatient thou:\r\n    Pst! Pst! a jet of nauseous taste\r\n  O'er the assembly sprinklest. Leave the bough\r\n    And fly the rascals thus disgraced,\r\n  Who stole thy well, and with malicious pleasure\r\n  Now lick their honey'd lips, and feed at leisure.\r\n\r\n  See these Bohemians without labour fed!\r\n    The ant the worst of all the crew--\r\n  Fly, drone, wasp, beetle too with horned head,\r\n    All of them sharpers thro' and thro',\r\n  Idlers the sun drew to thy well apace--\r\n  None more than she was eager for thy place,\r\n\r\n  More apt thy face to tickle, toe to tread,\r\n    Or nose to pinch, and then to run\r\n  Under the shade thine ample belly spread;\r\n    Or climb thy leg for ladder; sun\r\n  Herself audacious on thy wings, and go\r\n  Most insolently o'er thee to and fro.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  II.\r\n\r\n  Now comes a tale that no one should believe.\r\n    In other times, the ancients say,\r\n  The winter came, and hunger made thee grieve.\r\n    Thou didst in secret see one day\r\n  The ant below the ground her treasure store away.\r\n\r\n  The wealthy ant was drying in the sun\r\n    Her corn the dew had wet by night,\r\n  Ere storing it again; and one by one\r\n    She filled her sacks as it dried aright.\r\n  Thou camest then, and tears bedimmed thy sight,\r\n\r\n  Saying: \"'Tis very cold; the bitter bise\r\n    Blows me this way and that to-day.\r\n  I die of hunger. Of your riches please\r\n    Fill me my bag, and I'll repay,\r\n  When summer and its melons come this way.\r\n\r\n  \"Lend me a little corn.\" Go to, go to!\r\n    Think you the ant will lend an ear?\r\n  You are deceived. Great sacks, but nought for you!\r\n    \"Be off, and scrape some barrel clear!\r\n  You sing of summer: starve, for winter's here!\"\r\n\r\n  'Tis thus the ancient fable sings\r\n    To teach us all the prudence ripe\r\n  Of farthing-snatchers, glad to knot the string\r\n    That tie their purses. May the gripe\r\n  Of colic twist the guts of all such tripe!\r\n\r\n  He angers me, this fable-teller does,\r\n    Saying in winter thou dost seek\r\n  Flies, grubs, corn--thou dost never eat like us!\r\n    --Corn! Couldst thou eat it, with thy beak?\r\n  Thou hast thy fountain with its honey'd reek.\r\n\r\n  To thee what matters winter? Underground\r\n    Slumber thy children, sheltered; thou\r\n  The sleep that knows no waking sleepest sound.\r\n    Thy body, fallen from the bough,\r\n  Crumbles; the questing ant has found thee now.\r\n\r\n  The wicked ant of thy poor withered hide\r\n    A banquet makes; in little bits\r\n  She cuts thee up, and empties thine inside,\r\n    And stores thee where in wealth she sits:\r\n  Choice diet when the winter numbs the wits.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 III.\r\n\r\n  Here is the tale related duly,\r\n  And little resembling the fable, truly!\r\n  Hoarders of farthings, I know, deuce take it.\r\n  It isn't the story as you would make it!\r\n  Crook-fingers, big-bellies, what do you say,\r\n  Who govern the world with the cash-box--hey?\r\n\r\n  You have spread the story, with shrug and smirk,\r\n  That the artist ne'er does a stroke of work;\r\n  And so let him suffer, the imbecile!\r\n  Be you silent! 'Tis you, I think,\r\n  When the Cigale pierces the vine to drink,\r\n  Drive her away, her drink to steal;\r\n  And when she is dead--you make your meal!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE CIGALE LEAVES ITS BURROW\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Cigales appear about the summer solstice. Along the beaten\r\npaths, calcined by the sun, hardened by the passage of frequent feet, we\r\nsee little circular orifices almost large enough to admit the thumb.\r\nThese are the holes by which the larvæ of the Cigale have come up from\r\nthe depths to undergo metamorphosis. We see them more or less\r\neverywhere, except in fields where the soil has been disturbed by\r\nploughing. Their usual position is in the driest and hottest situations,\r\nespecially by the sides of roads or the borders of footpaths. Powerfully\r\nequipped for the purpose, able at need to pierce the turf or sun-dried\r\nclay, the larva, upon leaving the earth, seems to prefer the hardest\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nA garden alley, converted into a little Arabia Petræa by reflection from\r\na wall facing the south, abounds in such holes. During the last days of\r\nJune I have made an examination of these recently abandoned pits. The\r\nsoil is so compact that I needed a pick to tackle it.\r\n\r\nThe orifices are round, and close upon an inch in diameter. There is\r\nabsolutely no debris round them; no earth thrown up from within. This is\r\nalways the case; the holes of the Cigales are never surrounded by\r\ndumping-heaps, as are the burrows of the Geotrupes, another notable\r\nexcavator. The way in which the work is done is responsible for this\r\ndifference. The dung-beetle works from without inwards; she begins to\r\ndig at the mouth of the burrow, and afterwards re-ascends and\r\naccumulates the excavated material on the surface. The larva of the\r\nCigale, on the contrary, works outward from within, upward from below;\r\nit opens the door of exit at the last moment, so that it is not free for\r\nthe discharge of excavated material until the work is done. The first\r\nenters and raises a little rubbish-heap at the threshold of her burrow;\r\nthe second emerges, and cannot, while working, pile up its rubbish on a\r\nthreshold which as yet has no existence.\r\n\r\nThe burrow of the Cigale descends about fifteen inches. It is\r\ncylindrical, slightly twisted, according to the exigencies of the soil,\r\nand always approaches the vertical, or the direction of the shortest\r\npassage. It is perfectly free along its entire length. We shall search\r\nin vain for the rubbish which such an excavation must apparently\r\nproduce; we shall find nothing of the sort. The burrow terminates in a\r\ncul-de-sac, in a fairly roomy chamber with unbroken walls, which shows\r\nnot the least vestige of communication with any other burrow or\r\nprolongation of the shaft.\r\n\r\nTaking its length and diameter into account, we find the excavation has\r\na total volume of about twelve cubic inches. What becomes of the earth\r\nwhich is removed?\r\n\r\nSunk in a very dry, crumbling soil, we should expect the shaft and the\r\nchamber at the bottom to have soft, powdery walls, subject to petty\r\nlandslips, if no work were done but that of excavation. On the contrary,\r\nthe walls are neatly daubed, plastered with a sort of clay-like mortar.\r\nThey are not precisely smooth, indeed they are distinctly rough; but\r\ntheir irregularities are covered with a layer of plaster, and the\r\ncrumbling material, soaked in some glutinous liquid and dried, is held\r\nfirmly in place.\r\n\r\nThe larva can climb up and down, ascend nearly to the surface, and go\r\ndown into its chamber of refuge, without bringing down, with his claws,\r\nthe continual falls of material which would block the burrow, make\r\nascent a matter of difficulty, and retreat impossible. The miner shores\r\nup his galleries with uprights and cross-timbers; the builder of\r\nunderground railways supports the sides and roofs of his tunnels with a\r\nlining of brick or masonry or segments of iron tube; the larva of the\r\nCigale, no less prudent an engineer, plasters the walls of its burrow\r\nwith cement, so that the passage is always free and ready for use.\r\n\r\nIf I surprise the creature just as it is emerging from the soil in order\r\nto gain a neighbouring bough and there undergo transformation, I see it\r\nimmediately make a prudent retreat, descending to the bottom of its\r\nburrow without the slightest difficulty--a proof that even when about to\r\nbe abandoned for ever the refuge is not encumbered with rubbish.\r\n\r\nThe ascending shaft is not a hurried piece of work, scamped by a\r\ncreature impatient to reach the sunlight. It is a true dwelling, in\r\nwhich the larva may make a long stay. The plastered walls betray as\r\nmuch. Such precautions would be useless in the case of a simple exit\r\nabandoned as soon as made. We cannot doubt that the burrow is a kind of\r\nmeteorological observatory, and that its inhabitant takes note of the\r\nweather without. Buried underground at a depth of twelve or fifteen\r\ninches, the larva, when ripe for escape, could hardly judge whether the\r\nmeteorological conditions were favourable. The subterranean climate\r\nvaries too little, changes too slowly, and would not afford it the\r\nprecise information required for the most important action of its\r\nlife--the escape into the sunshine at the time of metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nPatiently, for weeks, perhaps for months, it digs, clears, and\r\nstrengthens a vertical shaft, leaving only a layer of earth a finger's\r\nbreadth in thickness to isolate it from the outer world. At the bottom\r\nit prepares a carefully built recess. This is its refuge, its place of\r\nwaiting, where it reposes in peace if its observations decide it to\r\npostpone its final departure. At the least sign of fine weather it\r\nclimbs to the top of its burrow, sounds the outer world through the thin\r\nlayer of earth which covers the shaft, and informs itself of the\r\ntemperature and humidity of the outer air.\r\n\r\nIf things are not going well--if there are threats of a flood or the\r\ndreaded _bise_--events of mortal gravity when the delicate insect issues\r\nfrom its cerements--the prudent creature re-descends to the bottom of\r\nits burrow for a longer wait. If, on the contrary, the state of the\r\natmosphere is favourable, the roof is broken through by a few strokes of\r\nits claws, and the larva emerges from its tunnel.\r\n\r\nEverything seems to prove that the burrow of the Cigale is a\r\nwaiting-room, a meteorological station, in which the larva makes a\r\nprolonged stay; sometimes hoisting itself to the neighbourhood of the\r\nsurface in order to ascertain the external climate; sometimes retiring\r\nto the depths the better to shelter itself. This explains the chamber\r\nat the base of the shaft, and the necessity of a cement to hold the\r\nwalls together, for otherwise the creature's continual comings and\r\ngoings would result in a landslip.\r\n\r\nA matter less easy of explanation is the complete disappearance of the\r\nmaterial which originally filled the excavated space. Where are the\r\ntwelve cubic inches of earth that represent the average volume of the\r\noriginal contents of the shaft? There is not a trace of this material\r\noutside, nor inside either. And how, in a soil as dry as a cinder, is\r\nthe plaster made with which the walls are covered?\r\n\r\nLarvæ which burrow in wood, such as those of Capricornis and Buprestes,\r\nwill apparently answer our first question. They make their way through\r\nthe substance of a tree-trunk, boring their galleries by the simple\r\nmethod of eating the material in front of them. Detached by their\r\nmandibles, fragment by fragment, the material is digested. It passes\r\nfrom end to end through the body of the pioneer, yields during its\r\npassage its meagre nutritive principles, and accumulates behind it,\r\nobstructing the passage, by which the larva will never return. The work\r\nof extreme division, effected partly by the mandibles and partly by the\r\nstomach, makes the digested material more compact than the intact wood,\r\nfrom which it follows that there is always a little free space at the\r\nhead of the gallery, in which the caterpillar works and lives; it is not\r\nof any great length, but just suffices for the movements of the\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nMust not the larva of the Cigale bore its passage in some such fashion?\r\nI do not mean that the results of excavation pass through its body--for\r\nearth, even the softest mould, could form no possible part of its diet.\r\nBut is not the material detached simply thrust back behind the excavator\r\nas the work progresses?\r\n\r\nThe Cigale passes four years under ground. This long life is not spent,\r\nof course, at the bottom of the well I have just described; that is\r\nmerely a resting-place preparatory to its appearance on the face of the\r\nearth. The larva comes from elsewhere; doubtless from a considerable\r\ndistance. It is a vagabond, roaming from one root to another and\r\nimplanting its rostrum. When it moves, either to flee from the upper\r\nlayers of the soil, which in winter become too cold, or to install\r\nitself upon a more juicy root, it makes a road by rejecting behind it\r\nthe material broken up by the teeth of its picks. That this is its\r\nmethod is incontestable.\r\n\r\nAs with the larvæ of Capricornis and Buprestes, it is enough for the\r\ntraveller to have around it the small amount of free space necessitated\r\nby its movements. Moist, soft, and easily compressible soil is to the\r\nlarva of the Cigale what digested wood-pulp is to the others. It is\r\ncompressed without difficulty, and so leaves a vacant space.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is that sometimes the burrow of exit from the\r\nwaiting-place is driven through a very arid soil, which is extremely\r\nrefractory to compression so long as it retains its aridity. That the\r\nlarva, when commencing the excavation of its burrow, has already thrust\r\npart of the detached material into a previously made gallery, now filled\r\nup and disappeared, is probable enough, although nothing in the actual\r\ncondition of things goes to support the theory; but if we consider the\r\ncapacity of the shaft and the extreme difficulty of making room for such\r\na volume of debris, we feel dubious once more; for to hide such a\r\nquantity of earth a considerable empty space would be necessary, which\r\ncould only be obtained by the disposal of more debris. Thus we are\r\ncaught in a vicious circle. The mere packing of the powdered earth\r\nrejected behind the excavator would not account for so large a void. The\r\nCigale must have a special method of disposing of the waste earth. Let\r\nus see if we can discover the secret.\r\n\r\nLet us examine a larva at the moment of emerging from the soil. It is\r\nalmost always more or less smeared with mud, sometimes dried, sometimes\r\nmoist. The implements of excavation, the claws of the fore-feet, have\r\ntheir points covered by little globules of mortar; the others bear\r\nleggings of mud; the back is spotted with clay. One is reminded of a\r\nscavenger who has been scooping up mud all day. This condition is the\r\nmore striking in that the insect comes from an absolutely dry soil. We\r\nshould expect to see it dusty; we find it muddy.\r\n\r\nOne more step, and the problem of the well is solved. I exhume a larva\r\nwhich is working at its gallery of exit. Chance postpones this piece of\r\nluck, which I cannot expect to achieve at once, since nothing on the\r\nsurface guides my search. But at last I am rewarded, and the larva is\r\njust beginning its excavation. An inch of tunnel, free of all waste or\r\nrubbish, and at the bottom the chamber, the place of rest; so far has\r\nthe work proceeded. And the worker--in what condition is it? Let us see.\r\n\r\nThe larva is much paler in colour than those which I have caught as they\r\nemerged. The large eyes in particular are whitish, cloudy, blurred, and\r\napparently blind. What would be the use of sight underground? The eyes\r\nof the larvæ leaving their burrows are black and shining, and evidently\r\ncapable of sight. When it issues into the sunlight the future Cigale\r\nmust find, often at some distance from its burrow, a suitable twig from\r\nwhich to hang during its metamorphosis, so that sight is obviously of\r\nthe greatest utility. The maturity of the eyes, attained during the time\r\nof preparation before deliverance, proves that the larva, far from\r\nboring its tunnel in haste, has spent a long time labouring at it.\r\n\r\nWhat else do we notice? The blind, pale larva is far more voluminous\r\nthan in the mature state; it is swollen with liquid as though it had\r\ndropsy. Taken in the fingers, a limpid serum oozes from the hinder part\r\nof the body, which moistens the whole surface. Is this fluid, evacuated\r\nby the intestine, a product of urinary secretion--simply the contents of\r\na stomach nourished entirely upon sap? I will not attempt to decide, but\r\nfor convenience will content myself with calling it urine.\r\n\r\nWell, this fountain of urine is the key to the enigma. As it digs and\r\nadvances the larva waters the powdery debris and converts it into a\r\npaste, which is immediately applied to the walls by the pressure of the\r\nabdomen. Aridity is followed by plasticity. The mud thus obtained\r\npenetrates the interstices of the rough soil; the more liquid portion\r\nenters the substance of the soil by infiltration; the remainder becomes\r\ntightly packed and fills up the inequalities of the walls. Thus the\r\ninsect obtains an empty tunnel, with no loose waste, as all the loosened\r\nsoil is utilised on the spot, converted into a mortar which is more\r\ncompact and homogeneous than the soil through which the shaft is\r\ndriven.\r\n\r\nThus the larva works in the midst of a coating of mud, which is the\r\ncause of its dirtiness, so astonishing when we see it issue from an\r\nexcessively dry soil. The perfect insect, although henceforth liberated\r\nfrom the work of a sapper and miner, does not entirely abandon the use\r\nof urine as a weapon, employing it as a means of defence. Too closely\r\nobserved it throws a jet of liquid upon the importunate enemy and flies\r\naway. In both its forms the Cigale, in spite of its dry temperament, is\r\na famous irrigator.\r\n\r\nDropsical as it is, the larva cannot contain sufficient liquid to\r\nmoisten and convert into easily compressible mud the long column of\r\nearth which must be removed from the burrow. The reservoir becomes\r\nexhausted, and the provision must be renewed. Where, and how? I think I\r\ncan answer the question.\r\n\r\nThe few burrows uncovered along their entirety, with the meticulous care\r\nsuch a task demands, have revealed at the bottom, encrusted in the wall\r\nof the terminal chamber, a living root, sometimes of the thickness of a\r\npencil, sometimes no bigger than a straw. The visible portion of this\r\nroot is only a fraction of an inch in length; the rest is hidden by the\r\nsurrounding earth. Is the presence of this source of sap fortuitous? Or\r\nis it the result of deliberate choice on the part of the larva? I\r\nincline towards the second alternative, so repeatedly was the presence\r\nof a root verified, at least when my search was skilfully conducted.\r\n\r\nYes, the Cigale, digging its chamber, the nucleus of the future shaft,\r\nseeks out the immediate neighbourhood of a small living root; it lays\r\nbare a certain portion, which forms part of the wall, without\r\nprojecting. This living spot in the wall is the fountain where the\r\nsupply of moisture is renewed. When its reservoir is exhausted by the\r\nconversion of dry dust into mud the miner descends to its chamber,\r\nthrusts its proboscis into the root, and drinks deep from the vat built\r\ninto the wall. Its organs well filled, it re-ascends. It resumes work,\r\ndamping the hard soil the better to remove it with its talons, reducing\r\nthe debris to mud, in order to pack it tightly around it and obtain a\r\nfree passage. In this manner the shaft is driven upwards; logic and the\r\nfacts of the case, in the absence of direct observation, justify the\r\nassertion.\r\n\r\nIf the root were to fail, and the reservoir of the intestine were\r\nexhausted, what would happen? The following experiment will inform us: a\r\nlarva is caught as it leaves the earth. I place it at the bottom of a\r\ntest-tube, and cover it with a column of dry earth, which is rather\r\nlightly packed. This column is about six inches in height. The larva has\r\njust left an excavation three times as deep, made in soil of the same\r\nkind, but offering a far greater resistance. Buried under this short\r\ncolumn of powdery earth, will it be able to gain the surface? If its\r\nstrength hold out the issue should be certain; having but lately made\r\nits way through the hard earth, this obstacle should be easily removed.\r\n\r\nBut I am not so sure. In removing the stopper which divided it from the\r\noutside world, the larva has expended its final store of liquid. The\r\ncistern is dry, and in default of a living root there is no means of\r\nreplenishing it. My suspicions are well founded. For three days the\r\nprisoner struggles desperately, but cannot ascend by so much as an inch.\r\nIt is impossible to fix the material removed in the absence of\r\nmoisture; as soon as it is thrust aside it slips back again. The labour\r\nhas no visible result; it is a labour of Sisyphus, always to be\r\ncommenced anew. On the fourth day the creature succumbs.\r\n\r\nWith the intestines full the result is very different.\r\n\r\nI make the same experiment with an insect which is only beginning its\r\nwork of liberation. It is swollen with fluid, which oozes from it and\r\nmoistens the whole body. Its task is easy; the overlying earth offers\r\nlittle resistance. A small quantity of liquid from the intestines\r\nconverts it into mud; forms a sticky paste which can be thrust aside\r\nwith the assurance that it will remain where it is placed. The shaft is\r\ngradually opened; very unevenly, to be sure, and it is almost choked up\r\nbehind the insect as it climbs upwards. It seems as though the creature\r\nrecognises the impossibility of renewing its store of liquid, and so\r\neconomises the little it possesses, using only just so much as is\r\nnecessary in order to escape as quickly as possible from surroundings\r\nwhich are strange to its inherited instincts. This parsimony is so well\r\njudged that the insect gains the surface at the end of twelve days.\r\n\r\nThe gate of issue is opened and left gaping, like a hole made with an\r\naugur. For some little time the larva wanders about the neighbourhood of\r\nits burrow, seeking an eyrie on some low-growing bush or tuft of thyme,\r\non a stem of grass or grain, or the twig of a shrub. Once found, it\r\nclimbs and firmly clasps its support, the head upwards, while the talons\r\nof the fore feet close with an unyielding grip. The other claws, if the\r\ndirection of the twig is convenient, assist in supporting it; otherwise\r\nthe claws of the two fore legs will suffice. There follows a moment of\r\nrepose, while the supporting limbs stiffen in an unbreakable hold. Then\r\nthe thorax splits along the back, and through the fissure the insect\r\nslowly emerges. The whole process lasts perhaps half an hour.\r\n\r\nThere is the adult insect, freed of its mask, and how different from\r\nwhat it was but how! The wings are heavy, moist, transparent, with\r\nnervures of a tender green. The thorax is barely clouded with brown. All\r\nthe rest of the body is a pale green, whitish in places. Heat and a\r\nprolonged air-bath are necessary to harden and colour the fragile\r\ncreature. Some two hours pass without any perceptible change. Hanging to\r\nits deserted shell by the two fore limbs, the Cigale sways to the least\r\nbreath of air, still feeble and still green. Finally, the brown colour\r\nappears and rapidly covers the whole body; the change of colour is\r\ncompleted in half an hour. Fastening upon its chosen twig at nine\r\no'clock in the morning, the Cigale flies away under my eyes at half-past\r\ntwelve.\r\n\r\nThe empty shell remains, intact except for the fissure in the back;\r\nclasping the twig so firmly that the winds of autumn do not always\r\nsucceed in detaching it. For some months yet and even during the winter\r\nyou will often find these forsaken skins hanging from the twigs in the\r\nprecise attitude assumed by the larva at the moment of metamorphosis.\r\nThey are of a horny texture, not unlike dry parchment, and do not\r\nreadily decay.\r\n\r\nI could gather some wonderful information regarding the Cigale were I to\r\nlisten to all that my neighbours, the peasants, tell me. I will give one\r\ninstance of rustic natural history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CIGALE AND THE EMPTY PUPA-SKIN.]\r\n\r\nAre you afflicted with any kidney trouble, or are you swollen with\r\ndropsy, or have you need of some powerful diuretic? The village\r\npharmacopoeia is unanimous in recommending the Cigale as a sovereign\r\nremedy. The insects in the adult form are collected in summer. They are\r\nstrung into necklaces which are dried in the sun and carefully preserved\r\nin some cupboard or drawer. A good housewife would consider it imprudent\r\nto allow July to pass without threading a few of these insects.\r\n\r\nDo you suffer from any nephritic irritation or from stricture? Drink an\r\ninfusion of Cigales. Nothing, they say, is more effectual. I must take\r\nthis opportunity of thanking the good soul who once upon a time, so I\r\nwas afterwards informed, made me drink such a concoction unawares for\r\nthe cure of some such trouble; but I still remain incredulous. I have\r\nbeen greatly struck by the fact that the ancient physician of Anazarbus\r\nused to recommend the same remedy. Dioscorides tells us: _Cicadæ, quae\r\ninassatae manduntur, vesicae doloribus prosunt_. Since the distant days\r\nof this patriarch of _materia medica_ the Provençal peasant has retained\r\nhis faith in the remedy revealed to him by the Greeks, who came from\r\nPhocæa with the olive, the fig, and the vine. Only one thing is changed:\r\nDioscorides advises us to eat the Cigales roasted, but now they are\r\nboiled, and the decoction is administered as medicine. The explanation\r\nwhich is given of the diuretic properties of the insect is a marvel of\r\ningenuousness. The Cigale, as every one knows who has tried to catch it,\r\nthrows a jet of liquid excrement in one's face as it flies away. It\r\ntherefore endows us with its faculties of evacuation. Thus Dioscorides\r\nand his contemporaries must have reasoned; so reasons the peasant of\r\nProvence to-day.\r\n\r\nWhat would you say, worthy neighbours, if you knew of the virtues of the\r\nlarva, which is able to mix sufficient mortar with its urine to build a\r\nmeteorological station and a shaft connecting with the outer world? Your\r\npowers should equal those of Rabelais' Gargantua, who, seated upon the\r\ntowers of Notre Dame, drowned so many thousands of the inquisitive\r\nParisians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF THE CIGALE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere I live I can capture five species of Cigale, the two principal\r\nspecies being the common Cigale and the variety which lives on the\r\nflowering ash. Both of these are widely distributed and are the only\r\nspecies known to the country folk. The larger of the two is the common\r\nCigale. Let me briefly describe the mechanism with which it produces its\r\nfamiliar note.\r\n\r\nOn the under side of the body of the male, immediately behind the\r\nposterior limbs, are two wide semicircular plates which slightly overlap\r\none another, the right hand lying over the left hand plate. These are\r\nthe shutters, the lids, the dampers of the musical-box. Let us remove\r\nthem. To the right and left lie two spacious cavities which are known in\r\nProvençal as the chapels (_li capello_). Together they form the church\r\n(_la glèiso_). Their forward limit is formed by a creamy yellow\r\nmembrane, soft and thin; the hinder limit by a dry membrane coloured\r\nlike a soap bubble and known in Provençal as the mirror (_mirau_).\r\n\r\nThe church, the mirrors, and the dampers are commonly regarded as the\r\norgans which produce the cry of the Cigale. Of a singer out of breath\r\none says that he has broken his mirrors (_a li mirau creba_). The same\r\nphrase is used of a poet without inspiration. Acoustics give the lie to\r\nthe popular belief. You may break the mirrors, remove the covers with a\r\nsnip of the scissors, and tear the yellow anterior membrane, but these\r\nmutilations do not silence the song of the Cigale; they merely change\r\nits quality and weaken it. The chapels are resonators; they do not\r\nproduce the sound, but merely reinforce it by the vibration of their\r\nanterior and posterior membranes; while the sound is modified by the\r\ndampers as they are opened more or less widely.\r\n\r\nThe actual source of the sound is elsewhere, and is somewhat difficult\r\nfor a novice to find. On the outer wall of either chapel, at the ridge\r\nformed by the junction of back and belly, is a tiny aperture with a\r\nhorny circumference masked by the overlapping damper. We will call this\r\nthe window. This opening gives access to a cavity or sound-chamber,\r\ndeeper than the \"chapels,\" but of much smaller capacity. Immediately\r\nbehind the attachment of the posterior wings is a slight protuberance,\r\nalmost egg-shaped, which is distinguishable, on account of its dull\r\nblack colour, from the neighbouring integuments, which are covered with\r\na silvery down. This protuberance is the outer wall of the\r\nsound-chamber.\r\n\r\nLet us cut it boldly away. We shall then lay bare the mechanism which\r\nproduces the sound, the _cymbal_. This is a small dry, white membrane,\r\noval in shape, convex on the outer side, and crossed along its larger\r\ndiameter by a bundle of three or four brown nervures, which give it\r\nelasticity. Its entire circumference is rigidly fixed. Let us suppose\r\nthat this convex scale is pulled out of shape from the interior, so\r\nthat it is slightly flattened and as quickly released; it will\r\nimmediately regain its original convexity owing to the elasticity of the\r\nnervures. From this oscillation a ticking sound will result.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago all Paris was buying a silly toy, called, I think, the\r\ncricket or _cri-cri_. It was a short slip of steel fixed by one end to a\r\nmetallic base. Pressed out of shape by the thumb and released, it\r\nyielded a very distressing, tinkling _click_. Nothing else was needed to\r\ntake the popular mind by storm. The \"cricket\" had its day of glory.\r\nOblivion has executed justice upon it so effectually that I fear I shall\r\nnot be understood when I recall this celebrated device.\r\n\r\nThe membranous cymbal and the steel cricket are analogous instruments.\r\nBoth produce a sound by reason of the rapid deformation and recovery of\r\nan elastic substance--in one case a convex membrane; in the other a slip\r\nof steel. The \"cricket\" was bent out of shape by the thumb. How is the\r\nconvexity of the cymbals altered? Let us return to the \"church\" and\r\nbreak down the yellow curtain which closes the front of each chapel. Two\r\nthick muscular pillars are visible, of a pale orange colour; they join\r\nat an angle, forming a ~V~, of which the point lies on the median line\r\nof the insect, against the lower face of the thorax. Each of these\r\npillars of flesh terminates suddenly at its upper extremity, as though\r\ncut short, and from the truncated portion rises a short, slender tendon,\r\nwhich is attached laterally to the corresponding cymbal.\r\n\r\nThere is the whole mechanism, no less simple than that of the steel\r\n\"cricket.\" The two muscular columns contract and relax, shorten and\r\nlengthen. By means of its terminal thread each sounds its cymbal, by\r\ndepressing it and immediately releasing it, when its own elasticity\r\nmakes it spring back into shape. These two vibrating scales are the\r\nsource of the Cigale's cry.\r\n\r\nDo you wish to convince yourself of the efficiency of this mechanism?\r\nTake a Cigale but newly dead and make it sing. Nothing is simpler. Seize\r\none of these muscular columns with the forceps and pull it in a series\r\nof careful jerks. The extinct _cri-cri_ comes to life again; at each\r\njerk there is a clash of the cymbal. The sound is feeble, to be sure,\r\ndeprived of the amplitude which the living performer is able to give it\r\nby means of his resonating chambers; none the less, the fundamental\r\nelement of the song is produced by this anatomist's trick.\r\n\r\nWould you, on the other hand, silence a living Cigale?--that obstinate\r\nmelomaniac, who, seized in the fingers, deplores his misfortune as\r\nloquaciously as ever he sang the joys of freedom in his tree? It is\r\nuseless to violate his chapels, to break his mirrors; the atrocious\r\nmutilation would not quiet him. But introduce a needle by the lateral\r\naperture which we have named the \"window\" and prick the cymbal at the\r\nbottom of the sound-box. A little touch and the perforated cymbal is\r\nsilent. A similar operation on the other side of the insect and the\r\ninsect is dumb, though otherwise as vigorous as before and without any\r\nperceptible wound. Any one not in the secret would be amazed at the\r\nresult of my pin-prick, when the destruction of the mirrors and the\r\nother dependencies of the \"church\" do not cause silence. A tiny\r\nperforation of no importance to the insect is more effectual than\r\nevisceration.\r\n\r\nThe dampers, which are rigid and solidly built, are motionless. It is\r\nthe abdomen itself which, by rising and falling, opens or closes the\r\ndoors of the \"church.\" When the abdomen is lowered the dampers exactly\r\ncover the chapels as well as the windows of the sound-boxes. The sound\r\nis then muted, muffled, diminished. When the abdomen rises the chapels\r\nare open, the windows unobstructed, and the sound acquires its full\r\nvolume. The rapid oscillations of the abdomen, synchronising with the\r\ncontractions of the motor muscles of the cymbals, determine the changing\r\nvolume of the sound, which seems to be caused by rapidly repeated\r\nstrokes of a fiddlestick.\r\n\r\nIf the weather is calm and hot, towards mid-day the song of the Cigale\r\nis divided into strophes of several seconds' duration, which are\r\nseparated by brief intervals of silence. The strophe begins suddenly. In\r\na rapid crescendo, the abdomen oscillating with increasing rapidity, it\r\nacquires its maximum volume; it remains for a few seconds at the same\r\ndegree of intensity, then becomes weaker by degrees, and degenerates\r\ninto a shake, which decreases as the abdomen returns to rest. With the\r\nlast pulsations of the belly comes silence; the length of the silent\r\ninterval varies according to the state of the atmosphere. Then, of a\r\nsudden, begins a new strophe, a monotonous repetition of the first; and\r\nso on indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIt often happens, especially during the hours of the sultry afternoons,\r\nthat the insect, intoxicated with sunlight, shortens and even suppresses\r\nthe intervals of silence. The song is then continuous, but always with\r\nan alternation of crescendo and diminuendo. The first notes are heard\r\nabout seven or eight o'clock in the morning, and the orchestra ceases\r\nonly when the twilight fails, about eight o'clock at night. The concert\r\nlasts a whole round of the clock. But if the sky is grey and the wind\r\nchilly the Cigale is silent.\r\n\r\nThe second species, only half the size of the common Cigale, is known in\r\nProvence as the _Cacan_; the name, being a fairly exact imitation of the\r\nsound emitted by the insect. This is the Cigale of the flowering ash,\r\nfar more alert and far more suspicious than the common species. Its\r\nharsh, loud song consists of a series of cries--_can! can! can!\r\ncan!_--with no intervals of silence subdividing the poem into stanzas.\r\nThanks to its monotony and its harsh shrillness, it is a most odious\r\nsound, especially when the orchestra consists of hundreds of performers,\r\nas is often the case in my two plane-trees during the dog-days. It is as\r\nthough a heap of dry walnuts were being shaken up in a bag until the\r\nshells broke. This painful concert, which is a real torment, offers only\r\none compensation: the Cigale of the flowering ash does not begin his\r\nsong so early as the common Cigale, and does not sing so late in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nAlthough constructed on the same fundamental principles, the vocal\r\norgans exhibit a number of peculiarities which give the song its special\r\ncharacter. The sound-box is lacking, which suppresses the entrance to\r\nit, or the window. The cymbal is uncovered, and is visible just behind\r\nthe attachment of the hinder wing. It is, as before, a dry white scale,\r\nconvex on the outside, and crossed by a bundle of fine reddish-brown\r\nnervures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. THE ADULT CIGALE, FROM BELOW.\r\n\r\n2. THE ADULT CIGALE, FROM BELOW.\r\n\r\n3. THE CIGALE OF THE FLOWERING ASH, MALE AND FEMALE.]\r\n\r\nFrom the forward side of the first segment of the abdomen project two\r\nshort, wide, tongue-shaped projections, the free extremities of which\r\nrest on the cymbals. These tongues may be compared to the blade of a\r\nwatchman's rattle, only instead of engaging with the teeth of a rotating\r\nwheel they touch the nervures of the vibrating cymbal. From this fact, I\r\nimagine, results the harsh, grating quality of the cry. It is hardly\r\npossible to verify the fact by holding the insect in the fingers; the\r\nterrified _Cacan_ does not go on singing his usual song.\r\n\r\nThe dampers do not overlap; on the contrary, they are separated by a\r\nfairly wide interval. With the rigid tongues, appendages of the abdomen,\r\nthey half shelter the cymbals, half of which is completely bare. Under\r\nthe pressure of the finger the abdomen opens a little at its\r\narticulation with the thorax. But the insect is motionless when it\r\nsings; there is nothing of the rapid vibrations of the belly which\r\nmodulate the song of the common Cigale. The chapels are very small;\r\nalmost negligible as resonators. There are mirrors, as in the common\r\nCigale, but they are very small; scarcely a twenty-fifth of an inch in\r\ndiameter. In short, the resonating mechanism, so highly developed in the\r\ncommon Cigale, is here extremely rudimentary. How then is the feeble\r\nvibration of the cymbals re-enforced until it becomes intolerable?\r\n\r\nThis species of Cigale is a ventriloquist. If we examine the abdomen by\r\ntransmitted light, we shall see that the anterior two-thirds of the\r\nabdomen are translucent. With a snip of the scissors we will cut off the\r\nposterior third, to which are relegated, reduced to the strictly\r\nindispensable, the organs necessary to the propagation of the species\r\nand the preservation of the individual. The rest of the abdomen presents\r\na spacious cavity, and consists simply of the integuments of the walls,\r\nexcept on the dorsal side, which is lined with a thin muscular layer,\r\nand supports a fine digestive canal, almost a thread. This large cavity,\r\nequal to nearly half the total volume of the insect, is thus almost\r\nabsolutely empty. At the back are seen the two motor muscles of the\r\ncymbals, two muscular columns arranged like the limbs of a ~V~. To right\r\nand left of the point of this ~V~ shine the tiny mirrors; and between\r\nthe two branches of muscle the empty cavity is prolonged into the depths\r\nof the thorax.\r\n\r\nThis empty abdomen with its thoracic annex forms an enormous resonator,\r\nsuch as no other performer in our countryside can boast of. If I close\r\nwith my finger the orifice of the truncated abdomen the sound becomes\r\nflatter, in conformity with the laws affecting musical resonators; if I\r\nfit into the aperture of the open body a tube or trumpet of paper the\r\nsound grows louder as well as deeper. With a paper cone corresponding\r\nto the pitch of the note, with its large end held in the mouth of a\r\ntest-tube acting as a resonator, we have no longer the cry of the\r\nCigale, but almost the bellowing of a bull. My little children,\r\ncoming up to me by chance at the moment of this acoustic experiment,\r\nfled in terror.\r\n\r\nThe grating quality of the sound appears to be due to the little tongues\r\nwhich press on the nervures of the vibrating cymbals; the cause of its\r\nintensity is of course the ample resonator in the abdomen. We must admit\r\nthat one must truly have a real passion for song before one would empty\r\none's chest and stomach in order to make room for a musical-box. The\r\nnecessary vital organs are extremely small, confined to a mere corner of\r\nthe body, in order to increase the amplitude of the resonating cavity.\r\nSong comes first of all; other matters take the second rank.\r\n\r\nIt is lucky that the _Cacan_ does not follow the laws of evolution. If,\r\nmore enthusiastic in each generation, it could acquire, in the course of\r\nprogress, a ventral resonator comparable to my paper trumpets, the South\r\nof France would sooner or later become uninhabitable, and the _Cacan_\r\nwould have Provence to itself.\r\n\r\nAfter the details already given concerning the common Cigale it is\r\nhardly needful to tell you how the insupportable _Cacan_ can be reduced\r\nto silence. The cymbals are plainly visible on the exterior. Pierce them\r\nwith the point of a needle, and immediately you have perfect silence. If\r\nonly there were, in my plane-trees, among the insects which carry\r\ngimlets, some friends of silence like myself, who would devote\r\nthemselves to such a task! But no: a note would be lacking in the\r\nmajestic symphony of harvest-tide.\r\n\r\nWe are now familiar with the structure of the musical organ of the\r\nCigale. Now the question arises: What is the object of these musical\r\norgies? The reply seems obvious: they are the call of the males inviting\r\ntheir mates; they constitute a lovers' cantata.\r\n\r\nI am going to consider this reply, which is certainly a very natural\r\none. For thirty years the common Cigale and his unmusical friend the\r\n_Cacan_ have thrust their society upon me. For two months every summer I\r\nhave them under my eyes, and their voice in my ears. If I do not listen\r\nto them very willingly I observe them with considerable zeal. I see\r\nthem ranged in rows on the smooth rind of the plane-trees, all with\r\ntheir heads uppermost, the two sexes mingled, and only a few inches\r\napart.\r\n\r\nThe proboscis thrust into the bark, they drink, motionless. As the sun\r\nmoves, and with it the shadow, they also move round the branch with slow\r\nlateral steps, so as to keep upon that side which is most brilliantly\r\nilluminated, most fiercely heated. Whether the proboscis is at work or\r\nnot the song is never interrupted.\r\n\r\nNow are we to take their interminable chant for a passionate love-song?\r\nI hesitate. In this gathering the two sexes are side by side. One does\r\nnot spend months in calling a person who is at one's elbow. Moreover, I\r\nhave never seen a female rush into the midst of even the most deafening\r\norchestra. Sight is a sufficient prelude to marriage, for their sight is\r\nexcellent. There is no need for the lover to make an everlasting\r\ndeclaration, for his mistress is his next-door neighbour.\r\n\r\nIs the song a means of charming, of touching the hard of heart? I doubt\r\nit. I observe no sign of satisfaction in the females; I have never seen\r\nthem tremble or sway upon their feet, though their lovers have clashed\r\ntheir cymbals with the most deafening vigour.\r\n\r\nMy neighbours the peasants say that at harvest-time the Cigale sings to\r\nthem: _Sego, sego, sego!_ (Reap, reap, reap!) to encourage them in their\r\nwork. Harvesters of ideas and of ears of grain, we follow the same\r\ncalling; the latter produce food for the stomach, the former food for\r\nthe mind. Thus I understand their explanation and welcome it as an\r\nexample of gracious simplicity.\r\n\r\nScience asks for a better explanation, but finds in the insect a world\r\nwhich is closed to us. There is no possibility of foreseeing, or even\r\nof suggesting the impression produced by this clashing of cymbals upon\r\nthose who inspire it. The most I can say is that their impassive\r\nexterior seems to denote a complete indifference. I do not insist that\r\nthis is so; the intimate feelings of the insect are an insoluble\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nAnother reason for doubt is this: all creatures affected by song have\r\nacute hearing, and this sense of hearing, a vigilant sentinel, should\r\ngive warning of danger at the slightest sound. The birds have an\r\nexquisite delicacy of hearing. If a leaf stirs among the branches, if\r\ntwo passers-by exchange a word, they are suddenly silent, anxious, and\r\non their guard. But the Cigale is far from sharing in such emotions. It\r\nhas excellent sight. Its great faceted eyes inform it of all that\r\nhappens to right and left; its three stemmata, like little ruby\r\ntelescopes, explore the sky above its head. If it sees us coming it is\r\nsilent at once, and flies away. But let us get behind the branch on\r\nwhich it is singing; let us manoeuvre so as to avoid the five centres\r\nof vision, and then let us speak, whistle, clap the hands, beat two\r\nstones together. For far less a bird which could not see you would stop\r\nits song and fly away terrified. The Cigale imperturbably continues to\r\nsing as if nothing had occurred.\r\n\r\nOf my experiences of this kind I will mention only one, the most\r\nremarkable of many.\r\n\r\nI borrowed the municipal artillery; that is, the iron boxes which are\r\ncharged with gunpowder on the day of the patron saint. The artilleryman\r\nwas delighted to load them for the benefit of the Cigales, and to fire\r\nthem off for me before my house. There were two of these boxes stuffed\r\nfull of powder as though for the most solemn rejoicing. Never was\r\npolitician making his electoral progress favoured with a bigger charge.\r\nTo prevent damage to my windows the sashes were all left open. The two\r\nengines of detonation were placed at the foot of the plane-trees before\r\nmy door, no precautions being taken to mask them. The Cigales singing in\r\nthe branches above could not see what was happening below.\r\n\r\nThere were six of us, spectators and auditors. We waited for a moment of\r\nrelative quiet. The number of singers was counted by each of us, as well\r\nas the volume and rhythm of the song. We stood ready, our ears attentive\r\nto the aerial orchestra. The box exploded with a clap of thunder.\r\n\r\nNo disturbance ensued above. The number of performers was the same, the\r\nrhythm the same, the volume the same. The six witnesses were unanimous:\r\nthe loud explosion had not modified the song of the Cigales in the\r\nleast. The second box gave an identical result.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to conclude from this persistence of the orchestra, its lack\r\nof surprise or alarm at the firing of a charge? Shall we conclude that\r\nthe Cigale is deaf? I am not going to venture so far as that; but if any\r\none bolder than myself were to make the assertion I really do not know\r\nwhat reasons I could invoke to disprove it. I should at least be forced\r\nto admit that it is very hard of hearing, and that we may well apply to\r\nit the homely and familiar phrase: to shout like a deaf man.\r\n\r\nWhen the blue-winged cricket, basking on the pebbles of some country\r\nfootpath, grows deliciously intoxicated with the heat of the sun and\r\nrubs its great posterior thighs against the roughened edge of its\r\nwing-covers; when the green tree-frog swells its throat in the foliage\r\nof the bushes, distending it to form a resonant cavity when the rain is\r\nimminent, is it calling to its absent mate? By no means. The efforts of\r\nthe former produce a scarcely perceptible stridulation; the palpitating\r\nthroat of the latter is as ineffectual; and the desired one does not\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nDoes the insect really require to emit these resounding effusions, these\r\nvociferous avowals, in order to declare its passion? Consult the immense\r\nmajority whom the conjunction of the sexes leaves silent. In the violin\r\nof the grasshopper, the bagpipe of the tree-frog, and the cymbals of the\r\n_Cacan_ I see only their peculiar means of expressing the joy of living,\r\nthe universal joy which every species of animal expresses after its\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nIf you were to tell me that the Cigales play on their noisy instruments\r\ncareless of the sound produced, and merely for the pleasure of feeling\r\nthemselves alive, just as we rub our hands in a moment of satisfaction,\r\nI should not be particularly shocked. That there is a secondary object\r\nin their conceit, in which the silent sex is interested, is very\r\npossible and very natural, but it is not as yet proven.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CIGALE. THE EGGS AND THEIR HATCHING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cigale confides its eggs to dry, slender twigs. All the branches\r\nexamined by Réaumur which bore such eggs were branches of the mulberry:\r\na proof that the person entrusted with the search for these eggs in the\r\nneighbourhood of Avignon did not bring much variety to his quest. I find\r\nthese eggs not only on the mulberry-tree, but on the peach, the cherry,\r\nthe willow, the Japanese privet, and other trees. But these are\r\nexceptions; what the Cigale really prefers is a slender twig of a\r\nthickness varying from that of a straw to that of a pencil. It should\r\nhave a thin woody layer and plenty of pith. If these conditions are\r\nfulfilled the species matters little. I should pass in review all the\r\nsemi-ligneous plants of the country were I to catalogue the various\r\nsupports which are utilised by the gravid female.\r\n\r\nIts chosen twig never lies along the ground; it is always in a more or\r\nless vertical position. It is usually growing in its natural position,\r\nbut is sometimes detached; in the latter case it will by chance have\r\nfallen so that it retains its upright position. The insect prefers a\r\nlong, smooth, regular twig which can receive the whole of its eggs. The\r\nbest batches of eggs which I have found have been laid upon twigs of\r\nthe _Spartium junceum_, which are like straws stuffed with pith, and\r\nespecially on the upper twigs of the _Asphodelus cerasiferus_, which\r\nrises nearly a yard from the ground before ramifying.\r\n\r\nIt is essential that the support, no matter what its nature, should be\r\ndead and perfectly dry.\r\n\r\nThe first operation performed by the Cigale consists in making a series\r\nof slight lacerations, such as one might make with the point of a pin,\r\nwhich, if plunged obliquely downwards into the twig, would tear the\r\nwoody fibres and would compress them so as to form a slight\r\nprotuberance.\r\n\r\nIf the twig is irregular in shape, or if several Cigales have been\r\nworking successively at the same point, the distribution of the\r\npunctures is confused; the eye wanders, incapable of recognising the\r\norder of their succession or the work of the individual. One\r\ncharacteristic is always present, namely, the oblique direction of the\r\nwoody fragment which is raised by the perforation, showing that the\r\nCigale always works in an upright position and plunges its rostrum\r\ndownwards in the direction of the twig.\r\n\r\nIf the twig is regular, smooth, and conveniently long the perforations\r\nare almost equidistant and lie very nearly in a straight line. Their\r\nnumber varies; it is small when the mother, disturbed in her operations,\r\nhas flown away to continue her work elsewhere; but they number thirty or\r\nforty, more or less, when they contain the whole of her eggs.\r\n\r\nEach one of the perforations is the entrance to an oblique tunnel, which\r\nis bored in the medullary sheath of the twig. The aperture is not\r\nclosed, except by the bunch of woody fibres, which, parted at the moment\r\nwhen the eggs are laid, recover themselves when the double saw of the\r\noviduct is removed. Sometimes, but by no means always, you may see\r\nbetween the fibres a tiny glistening patch like a touch of dried white\r\nof egg. This is only an insignificant trace of some albuminous secretion\r\naccompanying the egg or facilitating the work of the double saw of the\r\noviduct.\r\n\r\nImmediately below the aperture of the perforation is the egg chamber: a\r\nshort, tunnel-shaped cavity which occupies almost the whole distance\r\nbetween one opening and that lying below it. Sometimes the separating\r\npartition is lacking, and the various chambers run into one another, so\r\nthat the eggs, although introduced by the various apertures, are\r\narranged in an uninterrupted row. This arrangement, however, is not the\r\nmost usual.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the chambers vary greatly. I find in each from six to\r\nfifteen eggs. The average is ten. The total number of chambers varying\r\nfrom thirty to forty, it follows that the Cigale lays from three to four\r\nhundred eggs. Réaumur arrived at the same figures from an examination of\r\nthe ovaries.\r\n\r\nThis is truly a fine family, capable by sheer force of numbers of\r\nsurviving the most serious dangers. I do not see that the adult Cigale\r\nis exposed to greater dangers than any other insect: its eye is\r\nvigilant, its departure sudden, and its flight rapid; and it inhabits\r\nheights at which the prowling brigands of the turf are not to be feared.\r\nThe sparrow, it is true, will greedily devour it. From time to time he\r\nwill deliberately and meditatively descend upon the plane-trees from the\r\nneighbouring roof and snatch up the singer, who squeaks despairingly. A\r\nfew blows of the beak and the Cigale is cut into quarters, delicious\r\nmorsels for the nestlings. But how often does the bird return without\r\nhis prey! The Cigale, foreseeing his attack, empties its intestine in\r\nthe eyes of its assailant and flies away.\r\n\r\nBut the Cigale has a far more terrible enemy than the sparrow. This is\r\nthe green grasshopper. It is late, and the Cigales are silent. Drowsy\r\nwith light and heat, they have exhausted themselves in producing their\r\nsymphonies all day long. Night has come, and with it repose; but a\r\nrepose frequently troubled. In the thick foliage of the plane-trees\r\nthere is a sudden sound like a cry of anguish, short and strident. It is\r\nthe despairing lamentation of the Cigale surprised in the silence by the\r\ngrasshopper, that ardent hunter of the night, which leaps upon the\r\nCigale, seizes it by the flank, tears it open, and devours the contents\r\nof the stomach. After the orgy of music comes night and assassination.\r\n\r\nI obtained an insight into this tragedy in the following manner: I was\r\nwalking up and down before my door at daybreak when something fell from\r\nthe neighbouring plane-tree uttering shrill squeaks. I ran to see what\r\nit was. I found a green grasshopper eviscerating a struggling Cigale. In\r\nvain did the latter squeak and gesticulate; the other never loosed its\r\nhold, but plunged its head into the entrails of the victim and removed\r\nthem by little mouthfuls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. THE CIGALE LAYING HER EGGS.\r\n\r\n2. THE GREEN GRASSHOPPER, THE FALSE CIGALE OF THE NORTH, DEVOURING THE\r\nTRUE CIGALE, A DWELLER IN THE SOUTH.]\r\n\r\nThis was instructive. The attack was delivered high up above my head, in\r\nthe early morning, while the Cigale was resting; and the struggles of\r\nthe unfortunate creature as it was dissected alive had resulted in the\r\nfall of assailant and assailed together. Since then I have often been\r\nthe witness of similar assassinations.\r\n\r\nI have even seen the grasshopper, full of audacity, launch itself in\r\npursuit of the Cigale, who fled in terror. So the sparrow-hawk pursues\r\nthe skylark in the open sky. But the bird of prey is less ferocious than\r\nthe insect; it pursues a creature smaller than itself. The locust, on\r\nthe contrary, assails a colossus, far larger and far more vigorous than\r\nits enemy; yet the result is a foregone conclusion, in spite of this\r\ndisproportion. With its powerful mandibles, like pincers of steel, the\r\ngrasshopper rarely fails to eviscerate its captive, which, being\r\nweaponless, can only shriek and struggle.\r\n\r\nThe Cigale is an easy prey during its hours of somnolence. Every Cigale\r\nencountered by the ferocious grasshopper on its nocturnal round must\r\nmiserably perish. Thus are explained those sudden squeaks of anguish\r\nwhich are sometimes heard in the boughs during the hours of the night\r\nand early morning, although the cymbals have long been silent. The\r\nsea-green bandit has fallen upon some slumbering Cigale. When I wished\r\nto rear some green grasshoppers I had not far to seek for the diet of my\r\npensioners; I fed them on Cigales, of which enormous numbers were\r\nconsumed in my breeding-cages. It is therefore an established fact that\r\nthe green grasshopper, the false Cigale of the North, will eagerly\r\ndevour the true Cigale, the inhabitant of the Midi.\r\n\r\nBut it is neither the sparrow nor the green grasshopper that has forced\r\nthe Cigale to produce such a vast number of offspring. The real danger\r\nis elsewhere, as we shall see. The risk is enormous at the moment of\r\nhatching and also when the egg is laid.\r\n\r\nTwo or three weeks after its escape from the earth--that is, about the\r\nmiddle of July--the Cigale begins to lay. In order to observe the\r\nprocess without trusting too much to chance, I took certain precautions\r\nwhich would, I felt sure, prove successful. The dry Asphodelus is the\r\nsupport preferred by the insect, as previous observations had assured\r\nme. It was also the plant which best lent itself to my experiments, on\r\naccount of its long, smooth stems. Now, during the first years of my\r\nresidence in the South I replaced the thistles in my paddock by other\r\nnative plants of a less stubborn and prickly species. Among the new\r\noccupants was the asphodel. This was precisely what I needed for my\r\nexperiments. I left the dry stems of the preceding year in place, and\r\nwhen the breeding season arrived I inspected them daily.\r\n\r\nI had not long to wait. As early as July 15th I found as many Cigales as\r\nI could wish on the stems of the asphodel, all in process of laying. The\r\ngravid female is always solitary. Each mother has her twig to herself,\r\nand is in no danger of being disturbed during the delicate operation of\r\nlaying. When the first occupant has departed another may take her place,\r\nand so on indefinitely. There is abundance of room for all; but each\r\nprefers to be alone as her turn arrives. There is, however, no\r\nunpleasantness of any kind; everything passes most peacefully. If a\r\nfemale Cigale finds a place which has been already taken she flies away\r\nand seeks another twig directly she discovers her mistake.\r\n\r\nThe gravid female always retains an upright position at this time, as\r\nindeed she does at other times. She is so absorbed in her task that she\r\nmay readily be watched, even through a magnifying glass. The ovipositor,\r\nwhich is about four-tenths of an inch in length, is plunged obliquely\r\nand up to the hilt into the twig. So perfect is the tool that the\r\noperation is by no means troublesome. We see the Cigale tremble\r\nslightly, dilating and contracting the extremity of the abdomen in\r\nfrequent palpitations. This is all that can be seen. The boring\r\ninstrument, consisting of a double saw, alternately rises and sinks in\r\nthe rind of the twig with a gentle, almost imperceptible movement.\r\nNothing in particular occurs during the process of laying the eggs. The\r\ninsect is motionless, and hardly ten minutes elapse between the first\r\ncut of the ovipositor and the filling of the egg-chamber with eggs.\r\n\r\nThe ovipositor is then withdrawn with methodical deliberation, in order\r\nthat it may not be strained or bent. The egg-chamber closes of its own\r\naccord as the woody fibres which have been displaced return to their\r\nposition, and the Cigale climbs a little higher, moving upwards in a\r\nstraight line, by about the length of its ovipositor. It then makes\r\nanother puncture and a fresh chamber for another ten or twelve eggs. In\r\nthis way it scales the twig from bottom to top.\r\n\r\nThese facts being understood, we are able to explain the remarkable\r\narrangement of the eggs. The openings in the rind of the twig are\r\npractically equidistant, since each time the Cigale moves upward it is\r\nby a given length, namely, that of the ovipositor. Very rapid in flight,\r\nshe is a very idle walker. At the most you may see her, on the living\r\ntwig from which she is drinking, moving at a slow, almost solemn pace,\r\nto gain a more sunny point close at hand. On the dry twig in which she\r\ndeposits her eggs she observes the same formal habits, and even\r\nexaggerates them, in view of the importance of the operation. She moves\r\nas little as possible, just so far as she must in order to avoid running\r\ntwo adjacent egg-chambers into one. The extent of each movement upwards\r\nis approximately determined by the depth of the perforation.\r\n\r\nThe apertures are arranged in a straight line when their number is not\r\nvery large. Why, indeed, should the insect wander to right or to left\r\nupon a twig which presents the same surface all over? A lover of the\r\nsun, she chooses that side of the twig which is most exposed to it. So\r\nlong as she feels the heat, her supreme joy, upon her back, she will\r\ntake good care not to change the position which she finds so delightful\r\nfor another in which the sun would fall upon her less directly.\r\n\r\nThe process of depositing the eggs is a lengthy one when it is carried\r\nout entirely on the same twig. Counting ten minutes for each\r\negg-chamber, the full series of forty would represent a period of six or\r\nseven hours. The sun will of course move through a considerable distance\r\nbefore the Cigale can finish her work. In such cases the series of\r\napertures follows a spiral curve. The insect turns round the stalk as\r\nthe sun turns.\r\n\r\nVery often as the Cigale is absorbed in her maternal task a diminutive\r\nfly, also full of eggs, busily exterminates the Cigale's eggs as fast as\r\nthey are laid.\r\n\r\nThis insect was known to Réaumur. In nearly all the twigs examined he\r\nfound its grub, the cause of a misunderstanding at the beginning of his\r\nresearches. But he did not, could not see the audacious insect at work.\r\nIt is one of the Chalcididæ, about one-fifth or one-sixth of an inch in\r\nlength; entirely black, with knotty antennæ, which are slightly thicker\r\ntowards their extremities. The unsheathed ovipositor is implanted in the\r\nunder portion of the abdomen, about the middle, and at right angles to\r\nthe axis of the body, as in the case of the Leucospis, the pest of the\r\napiary. Not having taken the precaution to capture it, I do not know\r\nwhat name the entomologists have bestowed upon it, or even if this dwarf\r\nexterminator of the Cigale has as yet been catalogued. What I am\r\nfamiliar with is its calm temerity, its impudent audacity in the\r\npresence of the colossus who could crush it with a foot. I have seen as\r\nmany as three at once exploiting the unfortunate female. They keep close\r\nbehind the Cigale, working busily with their probes, or waiting until\r\ntheir victim deposits her eggs.\r\n\r\nThe Cigale fills one of her egg-chambers and climbs a little higher in\r\norder to bore another hole. One of the bandits runs to the abandoned\r\nstation, and there, almost under the claws of the giant, and without the\r\nleast nervousness, as if it were accomplishing some meritorious action,\r\nit unsheathes its probe and thrusts it into the column of eggs, not by\r\nthe open aperture, which is bristling with broken fibres, but by a\r\nlateral fissure. The probes works slowly, as the wood is almost intact.\r\nThe Cigale has time to fill the adjacent chamber.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she has finished one of these midges, the very same that has\r\nbeen performing its task below her, replaces her and introduces its\r\ndisastrous egg. By the time the Cigale departs, her ovaries empty, the\r\nmajority of the egg-chambers have thus received the alien egg which will\r\nwork the destruction of their contents. A small, quick-hatching grub,\r\nrichly nourished on a dozen eggs, will replace the family of the Cigale.\r\n\r\nThe experience of centuries has taught the Cigale nothing. With her\r\nexcellent eyesight she must be able to perceive these terrible sappers\r\nas they hover about her, meditating their crime. Too peaceable giantess!\r\nif you see them why do you not seize them in your talons, crush the\r\npigmies at their work, so that you may proceed with your travail in\r\nsecurity? But no, you will leave them untouched; you cannot modify your\r\ninstincts, even to alleviate your maternal misfortunes.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the common Cigale are of a shining ivory white. Conical at\r\nthe ends, and elongated in form, they might be compared in shape to the\r\nweaver's shuttle. Their length is about one-tenth of an inch, their\r\ndiameter about one-fiftieth. They are packed in a row, slightly\r\noverlapping one another. The eggs of the Cacan are slightly smaller, and\r\nare assembled in regular groups which remind one of microscopical\r\nbundles of cigars. We will consider the eggs of the common Cigale to the\r\nexclusion of the others, as their history is the history of all.\r\n\r\nSeptember is not yet over when the shining white as of ivory gives way\r\nto the yellow hue of cheese. During the first days of October you may\r\nsee, at the forward end of the egg, two tiny points of chestnut brown,\r\nwhich are the eyes of the embryo in formation. These two shining eyes,\r\nwhich almost seem to gaze at one, and the cone-shaped head of the egg,\r\ngive it the look of a tiny fish without fins--a fish for whom half a\r\nnut-shell would make a capacious aquarium.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time I notice frequently, on the asphodels in the paddock\r\nand on those of the neighbouring hills, certain indications that the\r\neggs have recently hatched out. There are certain cast-off articles of\r\nclothing, certain rags and tatters, left on the threshold of the\r\negg-chamber by the new-born grubs as they leave it and hurry in search\r\nof a new lodging. We shall see in a moment what these vestiges mean.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of my visits, which were so assiduous as to deserve\r\nsuccess, I had never contrived to see the young Cigales emerge from\r\ntheir egg-chambers. My domestic researches had been pursued in vain. Two\r\nyears running I had collected, in boxes, tubes, and bottles, a hundred\r\ntwigs of every kind which were peopled by the eggs of the Cigale; but\r\nnot one had shown me what I so desired to witness: the issue of the\r\nnew-born Cigales.\r\n\r\nRéaumur experienced the same disappointment. He tells us how all the\r\neggs supplied by his friends were abortive, even when he placed them in\r\na glass tube thrust under his armpit, in order to keep them at a high\r\ntemperature. No, venerable master! neither the temperate shelter of our\r\nstudies and laboratories, nor the incubating warmth of our bodies is\r\nsufficient here; we need the supreme stimulant, the kiss of the sun;\r\nafter the cool of the mornings, which are already sharp, the sudden\r\nblaze of the superb autumn weather, the last endearments of summer.\r\n\r\nIt was under such circumstances, when a blazing sun followed a cold\r\nnight, that I found the signs of completed incubation; but I always came\r\ntoo late; the young Cigales had departed. At most I sometimes found one\r\nhanging by a thread to its natal stem and struggling in the air. I\r\nsupposed it to be caught in a thread of gossamer, or some shred of\r\ncobweb.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 27th of October, despairing of success, I gathered some\r\nasphodels from the orchard, and the armful of dry twigs in which the\r\nCigales had laid their eggs was taken up to my study. Before giving up\r\nall hope I proposed once more to examine the egg-chambers and their\r\ncontents. The morning was cold, and the first fire of the season had\r\nbeen lit in my room. I placed my little bundle on a chair before the\r\nfire, but without any intention of testing the effect of the heat of the\r\nflames upon the concealed eggs. The twigs, which I was about to cut\r\nopen, one by one, were placed there to be within easy reach of my hand,\r\nand for no other reason.\r\n\r\nThen, while I was examining a split twig with my magnifying-glass, the\r\nphenomenon which I had given up all hope of observing took place under\r\nmy eyes. My bundle of twigs was suddenly alive; scores and scores of the\r\nyoung larvæ were emerging from their egg-chambers. Their numbers were\r\nsuch that my ambition as observer was amply satisfied. The eggs were\r\nripe, on the point of hatching, and the warmth of the fire, bright and\r\npenetrating, had the effect of sunlight in the open. I was quick to\r\nprofit by the unexpected piece of good fortune.\r\n\r\nAt the orifice of the egg-chamber, among the torn fibres of the bark, a\r\nlittle cone-shaped body is visible, with two black eye-spots; in\r\nappearance it is precisely like the fore portion of the butter-coloured\r\negg; or, as I have said, like the fore portion of a tiny fish. You would\r\nthink that an egg had been somehow displaced, had been removed from the\r\nbottom of the chamber to its aperture. An egg to move in this narrow\r\npassage! a walking egg! No, that is impossible; eggs \"do not do such\r\nthings!\" This is some mistake. We will break open the twig, and the\r\nmystery is unveiled. The actual eggs are where they always were, though\r\nthey are slightly disarranged. They are empty, reduced to the condition\r\nof transparent skins, split wide open at the upper end. From them has\r\nissued the singular organism whose most notable characteristics are as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nIn its general form, the configuration of the head and the great black\r\neyes, the creature, still more than the egg, has the appearance of an\r\nextremely minute fish. A simulacrum of a ventral fin increases the\r\nresemblance. This apparent fin in reality consists of the two\r\nfore-limbs, which, packed in a special sheath, are bent backwards,\r\nstretched out against one another in a straight line. Its small degree\r\nof mobility must enable the grub to escape from the egg-shell and, with\r\ngreater difficulty, from the woody tunnel leading to the open air.\r\nMoving outwards a little from the body, and then moving back again, this\r\nlever serves as a means of progression, its terminal hooks being already\r\nfairly strong. The four other feet are still covered by the common\r\nenvelope, and are absolutely inert. It is the same with the antennæ,\r\nwhich can scarcely be seen through the magnifying-glass. The organism\r\nwhich has issued from the egg is a boat-shaped body with a fin-shaped\r\nlimb pointing backwards on the ventral face, formed by the junction of\r\nthe two fore-limbs. The segmentation of the body is very clear,\r\nespecially on the abdomen. The whole body is perfectly smooth, without\r\nthe least suspicion of hair.\r\n\r\nWhat name are we to give to this initial phase of the Cigale--a phase so\r\nstrange, so unforeseen, and hitherto unsuspected? Must I amalgamate some\r\nmore or less appropriate words of Greek and fabricate a portentous\r\nnomenclature? No, for I feel sure that barbarous alien phrases are only\r\na hindrance to science. I will call it simply the _primary larva_, as I\r\nhave done in the case of the Meloides, the Leucospis, and the Anthrax.\r\n\r\nThe form of the primary larva of the Cigale is eminently adapted to its\r\nconditions and facilitates its escape. The tunnel in which the egg is\r\nhatched is very narrow, leaving only just room for passage. Moreover,\r\nthe eggs are arranged in a row, not end to end, but partially\r\noverlapping. The larva escaping from the hinder ranks has to squeeze\r\npast the empty shells, still in position, of the eggs which have already\r\nhatched, so that the narrowness of the passage is increased by the empty\r\negg-shells. Under these conditions the larva as it will be presently,\r\nwhen it has torn its temporary wrappings, would be unable to effect the\r\ndifficult passage. With the encumbrance of antennæ, with long limbs\r\nspreading far out from the axis of the body, with curved, pointed talons\r\nwhich hook themselves into their medium of support, everything would\r\nmilitate against a prompt liberation. The eggs in one chamber hatch\r\nalmost simultaneously. It is therefore essential that the first-born\r\nlarvæ should hurry out of their shelter as quickly as possible, leaving\r\nthe passage free for those behind them. Hence the boat-like shape, the\r\nsmooth hairless body without projections, which easily squeezes its way\r\npast obstructions. The primary larva, with its various appendages\r\nclosely wrapped against its body by a common sheath, with its fish-like\r\nform and its single and only partially movable limb, is perfectly\r\nadapted to make the difficult passage to the outer air.\r\n\r\nThis phase is of short duration. Here, for instance, a migrating larva\r\nshows its head, with its big black eyes, and raises the broken fibres of\r\nthe entrance. It gradually works itself forward, but so slowly that the\r\nmagnifying-glass scarcely reveals its progress. At the end of half an\r\nhour at the shortest we see the entire body of the creature; but the\r\norifice by which it is escaping still holds it by the hinder end of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThen, without further delay, the coat which it wears for this rough\r\npiece of work begins to split, and the larva skins itself, coming out of\r\nits wrappings head first. It is then the normal larva; the only form\r\nknown to Réaumur. The rejected coat forms a suspensory thread, expanding\r\nat its free end to form a little cup. In this cup is inserted the end of\r\nthe abdomen of the larva, which, before allowing itself to fall to\r\nearth, takes a sun-bath, grows harder, stretches itself, and tries its\r\nstrength, lightly swinging at the end of its life-line.\r\n\r\nThis little flea, as Réaumur calls it, first white, then amber-coloured,\r\nis precisely the larva which will delve in the earth. The antennæ, of\r\nfair length, are free and waving to and fro; the limbs are bending at\r\ntheir articulations; the fore-limbs, which are relatively powerful, open\r\nand shut their talons. I can scarcely think of any more curious\r\nspectacle than that of this tiny gymnast hanging by its tail, swinging\r\nto the faintest breath, and preparing in the air for its entry into the\r\nworld. It hangs there for a variable period; some larvæ let themselves\r\nfall at the end of half an hour; others spend hours in their\r\nlong-stemmed cup; some even remain suspended until the following day.\r\n\r\nWhether soon or late, the fall of the larva leaves suspended the thread\r\nby which it hung, the wrappings of the primary larva. When all the brood\r\nhave disappeared, the aperture of the nest is thus hung with a branch of\r\nfine, short threads, twisted and knotted together, like dried white of\r\negg. Each thread is expanded into a tiny cup at its free end. These are\r\nvery delicate and ephemeral relics, which perish at a touch. The least\r\nwind quickly blows them away.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the larva. Sooner or later, as we have seen, it falls\r\nto the ground, either by accident or intention. The tiny creature, no\r\nbigger than a flea, has preserved its tender newly-hatched flesh from\r\ncontact with the rough earth by hanging in the air until its tissues\r\nhave hardened. Now it plunges into the troubles of life.\r\n\r\nI foresee a thousand dangers ahead. A mere breath of wind may carry this\r\natom away, and cast it on that inaccessible rock in the midst of a rut\r\nin the road which still contains a little water; or on the sand, the\r\nregion of famine where nothing grows; or upon a soil of clay, too\r\ntenacious to be tunnelled. These mortal accidents are frequent, for\r\ngusts of wind are frequent in the windy and already severe weather of\r\nthe end of October.\r\n\r\nThis delicate organism requires a very soft soil, which can easily be\r\nentered, so that it may immediately obtain a suitable shelter. The cold\r\ndays are coming; soon the frosts will be here. To wander on the surface\r\nwould expose it to grave perils. It must contrive without delay to\r\ndescend into the earth, and that to no trivial depth. This is the unique\r\nand imperative condition of safety, and in many cases it is impossible\r\nof realisation. What use are the claws of this tiny flea against rock,\r\nsandstone, or hardened clay? The creature must perish if it cannot find\r\na subterranean refuge in good time.\r\n\r\nEverything goes to show that the necessity of this first foothold on the\r\nsoil, subject as it is to so many accidents, is the cause of the great\r\nmortality in the Cigale family. The little black parasite, the destroyer\r\nof eggs, in itself evokes the necessity of a large batch of eggs; and\r\nthe difficulty which the larva experiences in effecting a safe lodgment\r\nin the earth is yet another explanation of the fact that the maintenance\r\nof the race at its proper strength requires a batch of three or four\r\nhundred eggs from each mother. Subject to many accidents, the Cigale is\r\nfertile to excess. By the prodigality of her ovaries she conjures the\r\nhost of perils which threaten her offspring.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of my experiment I can at least spare the larvæ the\r\nworst difficulties of their first establishment underground. I take some\r\nsoil from the heath, which is very soft and almost black, and I pass it\r\nthrough a fine sieve. Its colour will enable me more easily to find the\r\ntiny fair-skinned larvæ when I wish to inform myself of passing events;\r\nits lightness makes it a suitable refuge for such weak and fragile\r\nbeings. I pack it Pretty firmly in a glass vase; I plant in it a little\r\ntuft of thyme; I sow in it a few grains of wheat. There is no hole at\r\nthe bottom of the vase, although there should be one for the benefit of\r\nthe thyme and the corn; but the captives would find it and escape by it.\r\nThe plantation and the crop will suffer from this lack of drainage, but\r\nat least I am sure of recovering my larvæ with the help of patience and\r\na magnifying-glass. Moreover, I shall go gently in the matter of\r\nirrigation, giving only just enough water to save the plants from\r\nperishing.\r\n\r\nWhen all is in order, and when the wheat is beginning to shoot, I place\r\nsix young larvæ of the Cigale on the surface of the soil. The tiny\r\ncreatures begin to pace hither and thither; they soon explore the\r\nsurface of their world, and some try vainly to climb the sides of the\r\nvase. Not one of them seems inclined to bury itself; so that I ask\r\nmyself anxiously what can be the object of their prolonged and active\r\nexplorations. Two hours go by, but their wanderings continue.\r\n\r\nWhat do they want? Food? I offer them some tiny bulbs with bundles of\r\nsprouting roots, a few fragments of leaves and some fresh blades of\r\ngrass. Nothing tempts them; nothing brings them to a standstill.\r\nApparently they are seeking for a favourable point before descending\r\ninto the earth. But there is no need for this hesitating exploration on\r\nthe soil I have prepared for them; the whole area, or so it seems to me,\r\nlends itself excellently to the operations which I am expecting to see\r\nthem commence. Yet apparently it will not answer the purpose.\r\n\r\nUnder natural conditions a little wandering might well be indispensable.\r\nSpots as soft as my bed of earth from the roots of the briar-heather,\r\npurged of all hard bodies and finely sifted, are rare in nature. Coarse\r\nsoils are more usual, on which the tiny creatures could make no\r\nimpression. The larva must wander at hazard, must make a pilgrimage of\r\nindefinite duration before finding a favourable place. Very many, no\r\ndoubt, perish, exhausted by their fruitless search. A voyage of\r\nexploration in a country a few inches wide evidently forms part of the\r\ncurriculum of young Cigales. In my glass prison, so luxuriously\r\nfurnished, this pilgrimage is useless. Never mind: it must be\r\naccomplished according to the consecrated rites.\r\n\r\nAt last my wanderers grow less excited. I see them attack the earth with\r\nthe curved talons of their fore-limbs, digging their claws into it and\r\nmaking such an excavation as the point of a thick needle would enter.\r\nWith a magnifying-glass I watch their picks at work. I see their talons\r\nraking atom after atom of earth to the surface. In a few minutes there\r\nis a little gaping well. The larva climbs downwards and buries itself,\r\nhenceforth invisible.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow I turn out the contents of the vase without breaking the\r\nmould, which is held together by the roots of the thyme and the wheat. I\r\nfind all my larvæ at the bottom, arrested by the glass. In twenty-four\r\nhours they had sunk themselves through the entire thickness of the\r\nearth--a matter of some four inches. But for obstacle at the bottom they\r\nwould have sunk even further.\r\n\r\nOn the way they have probably encountered the rootlets of my little\r\nplantation. Did they halt in order to take a little nourishment by\r\nimplanting their proboscis? This is hardly probable, for a few rootlets\r\nwere pressed against the bottom of the glass, but none of my prisoners\r\nwere feeding. Perhaps the shock of reversing the pot detached them.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that underground there is no other nourishment for them\r\nthan the sap of roots. Adult or larva, the Cigale is a strict\r\nvegetarian. As an adult insect it drinks the sap of twigs and branches;\r\nas a larva it sucks the sap of roots. But at what stage does it take the\r\nfirst sip? That I do not know as yet, but the foregoing experiment seems\r\nto show that the newly hatched larva is in greater haste to burrow deep\r\ninto the soil, so as to obtain shelter from the coming winter, than to\r\nstation itself at the roots encountered in its passage downwards.\r\n\r\nI replace the mass of soil in the vase, and the six exhumed larvæ are\r\nonce more placed on the surface of the soil. This time they commence to\r\ndig at once, and have soon disappeared. Finally the vase is placed in my\r\nstudy window, where it will be subject to the influences, good and ill,\r\nof the outer air.\r\n\r\nA month later, at the end of November, I pay the young Cigales a second\r\nvisit. They are crouching, isolated at the bottom of the mould. They do\r\nnot adhere to the roots; they have not grown; their appearance has not\r\naltered. Such as they were at the beginning of the experiment, such they\r\nare now, but rather less active. Does not this lack of growth during\r\nNovember, the mildest month of winter, prove that no nourishment is\r\ntaken until the spring?\r\n\r\nThe young Sitares, which are also very minute, directly they issue from\r\nthe egg at the entrance of the tubes of the Anthrophorus, remain\r\nmotionless, assembled in a heap, and pass the whole of the winter in a\r\nstate of complete abstinence. The young Cigales apparently behave in a\r\nvery similar fashion. Once they have burrowed to such depths as will\r\nsafeguard them from the frosts they sleep in solitude in their winter\r\nquarters, and await the return of spring before piercing some\r\nneighbouring root and taking their first repast.\r\n\r\nI have tried unsuccessfully to confirm these deductions by observation.\r\nIn April I unpotted my plant of thyme for the third time. I broke up the\r\nmould and spread it under the magnifying-glass. It was like looking for\r\nneedles in a haystack; but at last I recovered my little Cigales. They\r\nwere dead, perhaps of cold, in spite of the bell-glass with which I had\r\ncovered the pot, or perhaps of starvation, if the thyme was not a\r\nsuitable food-plant. I give up the problem as too difficult of solution.\r\n\r\nTo rear such larvæ successfully one would require a deep, extensive bed\r\nof earth which would shelter them from the winter cold; and, as I do not\r\nknow what roots they prefer, a varied vegetation, so that the little\r\ncreatures could choose according to their taste. These conditions are by\r\nno means impracticable, but how, in the large earthy mass, containing at\r\nleast a cubic yard of soil, should we recover the atoms I had so much\r\ntrouble to find in a handful of black soil from the heath? Moreover,\r\nsuch a laborious search would certainly detach the larva from its root.\r\n\r\nThe early subterranean life of the Cigale escapes us. That of the\r\nmaturer larva is no better known. Nothing is more common, while digging\r\nin the fields to any depth, to find these impetuous excavators under the\r\nspade; but to surprise them fixed upon the roots which incontestably\r\nnourish them is quite another matter. The disturbance of the soil warns\r\nthe larva of danger. It withdraws its proboscis in order to retreat\r\nalong its galleries, and when the spade uncovers it has ceased to feed.\r\n\r\nIf the hazards of field-work, with its inevitable disturbance of the\r\nlarvæ, cannot teach us anything of their subterranean habits, we can at\r\nleast learn something of the duration of the larval stage. Some obliging\r\nfarmers, who were making some deep excavations in March, were good\r\nenough to collect for me all the larvæ, large and small, unearthed in\r\nthe course of their labour. The total collection amounted to several\r\nhundreds. They were divided, by very clearly marked differences of size,\r\ninto three categories: the large larvæ, with rudiments of wings, such as\r\nthose larvæ caught upon leaving the earth possess; the medium-sized, and\r\nthe small. Each of these stages must correspond to a different age. To\r\nthese we may add the larvæ produced by the last hatching of eggs,\r\ncreatures too minute to be noticed by my rustic helpers, and we obtain\r\nfour years as the probable term of the larvæ underground.\r\n\r\nThe length of their aerial existence is more easily computed. I hear the\r\nfirst Cigales about the summer solstice. A month later the orchestra has\r\nattained its full power. A very few late singers execute their feeble\r\nsolos until the middle of September. This is the end of the concert. As\r\nall the larvæ do not issue from the ground at the same time, it is\r\nevident that the singers of September are not contemporary with those\r\nthat began to sing at the solstice. Taking the average between these two\r\ndates, we get five weeks as the probable duration of the Cigales' life\r\non earth.\r\n\r\nFour years of hard labour underground, and a month of feasting in the\r\nsun; such is the life of the Cigale. Do not let us again reproach the\r\nadult insect with his triumphant delirium. For four years, in the\r\ndarkness he has worn a dirty parchment overall; for four years he has\r\nmined the soil with his talons, and now the mud-stained sapper is\r\nsuddenly clad in the finest raiment, and provided with wings that rival\r\nthe bird's; moreover, he is drunken with heat and flooded with light,\r\nthe supreme terrestrial joy. His cymbals will never suffice to celebrate\r\nsuch felicity, so well earned although so ephemeral.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE MANTIS.--THE CHASE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another creature of the Midi which is quite as curious and\r\ninteresting as the Cigale, but much less famous, as it is voiceless. If\r\nProvidence had provided it with cymbals, which are a prime element of\r\npopularity, it would soon have eclipsed the renown of the celebrated\r\nsinger, so strange is its shape, and so peculiar its manners. It is\r\ncalled by the Provençals _lou Prègo-Diéu_, the creature which prays to\r\nGod. Its official name is the Praying Mantis (_Mantis religiosa_, Lin.).\r\n\r\nFor once the language of science and the vocabulary of the peasant\r\nagree. Both represent the Mantis as a priestess delivering oracles, or\r\nan ascetic in a mystic ecstasy. The comparison is a matter of antiquity.\r\nThe ancient Greeks called the insect [Greek: Mantis], the divine, the\r\nprophet. The worker in the fields is never slow in perceiving analogies;\r\nhe will always generously supplement the vagueness of the facts. He has\r\nseen, on the sun-burned herbage of the meadows, an insect of commanding\r\nappearance, drawn up in majestic attitude. He has noticed its wide,\r\ndelicate wings of green, trailing behind it like long linen veils; he\r\nhas seen its fore-limbs, its arms, so to speak, raised towards to the\r\nsky in a gesture of invocation. This was enough: popular imagination\r\nhas done the rest; so that since the period of classical antiquity the\r\nbushes have been peopled with priestesses emitting oracles and nuns in\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\nGood people, how very far astray your childlike simplicity has led you!\r\nThese attitudes of prayer conceal the most atrocious habits; these\r\nsupplicating arms are lethal weapons; these fingers tell no rosaries,\r\nbut help to exterminate the unfortunate passer-by. It is an exception\r\nthat we should never look for in the vegetarian family of the\r\nOrthoptera, but the Mantis lives exclusively upon living prey. It is the\r\ntiger of the peaceful insect peoples; the ogre in ambush which demands a\r\ntribute of living flesh. If it only had sufficient strength its\r\nblood-thirsty appetites, and its horrible perfection of concealment\r\nwould make it the terror of the countryside. The _Prègo-Diéu_ would\r\nbecome a Satanic vampire.\r\n\r\nApart from its lethal weapon the Mantis has nothing about it to inspire\r\napprehension. It does not lack a certain appearance of graciousness,\r\nwith its slender body, its elegant waist-line, its tender green\r\ncolouring, and its long gauzy wings. No ferocious jaws, opening like\r\nshears; on the contrary, a fine pointed muzzle which seems to be made\r\nfor billing and cooing. Thanks to a flexible neck, set freely upon the\r\nthorax, the head can turn to right or left as on a pivot, bow, or raise\r\nitself high in the air. Alone among insects, the Mantis is able to\r\ndirect its gaze; it inspects and examines; it has almost a physiognomy.\r\n\r\nThere is a very great contrast between the body as a whole, which has a\r\nperfectly peaceable aspect, and the murderous fore-limbs. The haunch of\r\nthe fore-limb is unusually long and powerful. Its object is to throw\r\nforward the living trap which does not wait for the victim, but goes in\r\nsearch of it. The snare is embellished with a certain amount of\r\nornamentation. On the inner face the base of the haunch is decorated\r\nwith a pretty black spot relieved by smaller spots of white, and a few\r\nrows of fine pearly spots complete the ornamentation.\r\n\r\nThe thigh, still longer, like a flattened spindle, carries on the\r\nforward half of the lower face a double row of steely spines. The\r\ninnermost row contains a dozen, alternately long and black and short and\r\ngreen. This alternation of unequal lengths makes the weapon more\r\neffectual for holding. The outer row is simpler, having only four teeth.\r\nFinally, three needle-like spikes, the longest of all, rise behind the\r\ndouble series of spikes. In short, the thigh is a saw with two parallel\r\nedges, separated by a groove in which the foreleg lies when folded.\r\n\r\nThe foreleg, which is attached to the thigh by a very flexible\r\narticulation, is also a double-edged saw, but the teeth are smaller,\r\nmore numerous, and closer than those of the thigh. It terminates in a\r\nstrong hook, the point of which is as sharp as the finest needle: a hook\r\nwhich is fluted underneath and has a double blade like a pruning-knife.\r\n\r\nA weapon admirably adapted for piercing and tearing, this hook has\r\nsometimes left me with visible remembrances. Caught in turn by the\r\ncreature which I had just captured, and not having both hands free, I\r\nhave often been obliged to get a second person to free me from my\r\ntenacious captive! To free oneself by violence without disengaging the\r\nfirmly implanted talons would result in lacerations such as the thorns\r\nof a rosebush will produce. None of our insects is so inconvenient to\r\nhandle. The Mantis digs its knife-blades into your flesh, pierces you\r\nwith its needles, seizes you as in a vice, and renders self-defence\r\nalmost impossible if, wishing to take your quarry alive, you refrain\r\nfrom crushing it out of existence.\r\n\r\nWhen the Mantis is in repose its weapons are folded and pressed against\r\nthe thorax, and are perfectly inoffensive in appearance. The insect is\r\napparently praying. But let a victim come within reach, and the attitude\r\nof prayer is promptly abandoned. Suddenly unfolded, the three long\r\njoints of the deadly fore-limbs shoot out their terminal talons, which\r\nstrike the victim and drag it backwards between the two saw-blades of\r\nthe thighs. The vice closes with a movement like that of the forearm\r\nupon the upper arm, and all is over; crickets, grasshoppers, and even\r\nmore powerful insects, once seized in this trap with its four rows of\r\nteeth, are lost irreparably. Their frantic struggles will never release\r\nthe hold of this terrible engine of destruction.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the Mantis cannot be continuously studied in the freedom\r\nof the fields; the insect must be domesticated. There is no difficulty\r\nhere; the Mantis is quite indifferent to imprisonment under glass,\r\nprovided it is well fed. Offer it a tasty diet, feed it daily, and it\r\nwill feel but little regret for its native thickets.\r\n\r\nFor cages I use a dozen large covers of wire gauze, such as are used in\r\nthe larder to protect meat from the flies. Each rests upon a tray full\r\nof sand. A dry tuft of thyme and a flat stone on which the eggs may be\r\nlaid later on complete the furnishing of such a dwelling. These cages\r\nare placed in a row on the large table in my entomological laboratory,\r\nwhere the sun shines on them during the greater part of the day. There\r\nI install my captives; some singly, some in groups.\r\n\r\nIt is in the latter half of August that I begin to meet with the adult\r\ninsect on the faded herbage and the brambles at the roadside. The\r\nfemales, whose bellies are already swollen, are more numerous every day.\r\nTheir slender companions, on the other hand, are somewhat rare, and I\r\noften have some trouble in completing my couples; whose relations will\r\nfinally be terminated by a tragic consummation. But we will reserve\r\nthese amenities for a later time, and will consider the females first.\r\n\r\nThey are tremendous eaters, so that their entertainment, when it lasts\r\nfor some months is not without difficulties. Their provisions must be\r\nrenewed every day, for the greater part are disdainfully tasted and\r\nthrown aside. On its native bushes I trust the Mantis is more\r\neconomical. Game is not too abundant, so that she doubtless devours her\r\nprey to the last atom; but in my cages it is always at hand. Often,\r\nafter a few mouthfuls, the insect will drop the juicy morsel without\r\ndisplaying any further interest in it. Such is the ennui of captivity!\r\n\r\nTo provide them with a luxurious table I have to call in assistants. Two\r\nor three of the juvenile unemployed of my neighbourhood, bribed by\r\nslices of bread and jam or of melon, search morning and evening on the\r\nneighbouring lawns, where they fill their game-bags, little cases made\r\nfrom sections of reeds, with living grasshoppers and crickets. On my own\r\npart, I make a daily tour of the paddock, net in hand, with the object\r\nof obtaining some choice dish for my guests.\r\n\r\nThese particular captures are destined to show me just how far the\r\nvigour and audacity of the Mantis will lead it. They include the large\r\ngrey cricket (_Pachytylus cinerascens_, Fab.), which is larger than the\r\ncreature which devours it; the white-faced Decticus, armed with powerful\r\nmandibles from which it is wise to guard one's fingers; the grotesque\r\nTruxalis, wearing a pyramidal mitre on its head; and the Ephippigera of\r\nthe vineyards, which clashes its cymbals and carries a sabre at the end\r\nof its barrel-shaped abdomen. To this assortment of disobliging\r\ncreatures let us add two horrors: the silky Epeirus, whose disc-shaped\r\nscalloped abdomen is as big as a shilling, and the crowned Epeirus,\r\nwhich is horribly hairy and corpulent.\r\n\r\nI cannot doubt that the Mantis attacks such adversaries in a state of\r\nnature when I see it, under my wire-gauze covers, boldly give battle to\r\nwhatever is placed before it. Lying in wait among the bushes it must\r\nprofit by the prizes bestowed upon it by hazard, as in its cage it\r\nprofits by the wealth of diet due to my generosity. The hunting of such\r\nbig game as I offer, which is full of danger, must form part of the\r\ncreature's usual life, though it may be only an occasional pastime,\r\nperhaps to the great regret of the Mantis.\r\n\r\nCrickets of all kinds, butterflies, bees, large flies of many species,\r\nand other insects of moderate size: such is the prey that we habitually\r\nfind in the embrace of the murderous arms of the Mantis. But in my cages\r\nI have never known the audacious huntress to recoil before any other\r\ninsect. Grey cricket, Decticus, Epeirus or Truxalis, sooner or later all\r\nare harpooned, held motionless between the saw-edges of the arms, and\r\ndeliciously crunched at leisure. The process deserves a detailed\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of a great cricket, which thoughtlessly approaches along\r\nthe wire-work of the cover, the Mantis, shaken by a convulsive start,\r\nsuddenly assumes a most terrifying posture. An electric shock would not\r\nproduce a more immediate result. The transition is so sudden, the\r\nmimicry so threatening, that the unaccustomed observer will draw back\r\nhis hand, as though at some unknown danger. Seasoned as I am, I myself\r\nmust confess to being startled on occasions when my thoughts have been\r\nelsewhere. The creature spreads out like a fan actuated by a spring, or\r\na fantastic Jack-in-the-box.\r\n\r\nThe wing-covers open, and are thrust obliquely aside; the wings spring\r\nto their full width, standing up like parallel screens of transparent\r\ngauze, forming a pyramidal prominence which dominates the back; the end\r\nof the abdomen curls upwards crosier-wise, then falls and unbends itself\r\nwith a sort of swishing noise, a _pouf! pouf!_ like the sound emitted by\r\nthe feathers of a strutting turkey-cock. One is reminded of the puffing\r\nof a startled adder.\r\n\r\nProudly straddling on its four hind-claws, the insect holds its long\r\nbody almost vertical. The murderous fore-limbs, at first folded and\r\npressed against one another on the thorax, open to their full extent,\r\nforming a cross with the body, and exhibiting the axillæ ornamented with\r\nrows of pearls, and a black spot with a central point of white. These\r\ntwo eyes, faintly recalling those of the peacock's tail, and the fine\r\nebony embossments, are part of the blazonry of conflict, concealed upon\r\nordinary occasions. Their jewels are only assumed when they make\r\nthemselves terrible and superb for battle.\r\n\r\nMotionless in its weird position, the Mantis surveys the acridian, its\r\ngaze fixed upon it, its head turning gently as on a pivot as the other\r\nchanges place. The object of this mimicry seems evident; the Mantis\r\nwishes to terrorise its powerful prey, to paralyse it with fright; for\r\nif not demoralised by fear the quarry might prove too dangerous.\r\n\r\nDoes it really terrify its prey? Under the shining head of the Decticus,\r\nbehind the long face of the cricket, who is to say what is passing? No\r\nsign of emotion can reveal itself upon these immovable masks. Yet it\r\nseems certain that the threatened creature is aware of its danger. It\r\nsees, springing up before it, a terrible spectral form with talons\r\noutstretched, ready to fall upon it; it feels itself face to face with\r\ndeath, and fails to flee while yet there is time. The creature that\r\nexcels in leaping, and might so easily escape from the threatening\r\nclaws, the wonderful jumper with the prodigious thighs, remains\r\ncrouching stupidly in its place, or even approaches the enemy with\r\ndeliberate steps.[2]\r\n\r\nIt is said that young birds, paralysed with terror by the gaping mouth\r\nof a serpent, or fascinated by its gaze, will allow themselves to be\r\nsnatched from the nest, incapable of movement. The cricket will often\r\nbehave in almost the same way. Once within reach of the enchantress, the\r\ngrappling-hooks are thrown, the fangs strike, the double saws close\r\ntogether and hold the victim in a vice. Vainly the captive struggles;\r\nhis mandibles chew the air, his desperate kicks meet with no resistance.\r\nHe has met with his fate. The Mantis refolds her wings, the standard of\r\nbattle; she resumes her normal pose, and the meal commences.\r\n\r\nIn attacking the Truxalis and the Ephippigera, less dangerous game than\r\nthe grey cricket and the Decticus, the spectral pose is less imposing\r\nand of shorter duration. It is often enough to throw forward the talons;\r\nthis is so in the case of the Epeirus, which is seized by the middle of\r\nthe body, without a thought of its venomous claws. With the smaller\r\ncrickets, which are the customary diet in my cages as at liberty, the\r\nMantis rarely employs her means of intimidation; she merely seizes the\r\nheedless passer-by as she lies in wait.\r\n\r\nWhen the insect to be captured may present some serious resistance, the\r\nMantis is thus equipped with a pose which terrifies or perplexes,\r\nfascinates or absorbs the prey, while it enables her talons to strike\r\nwith greater certainty. Her gins close on a demoralised victim,\r\nincapable of or unready for defence. She freezes the quarry with fear or\r\namazement by suddenly assuming the attitude of a spectre.\r\n\r\nThe wings play an important part in this fantastic pose. They are very\r\nwide, green on the outer edge, but colourless and transparent elsewhere.\r\nNumerous nervures, spreading out fan-wise, cross them in the direction\r\nof their length. Others, transversal but finer, cut the first at right\r\nangles, forming with them a multitude of meshes. In the spectral\r\nattitude the wings are outspread and erected in two parallel planes\r\nwhich are almost in contact, like the wings of butterflies in repose.\r\nBetween the two the end of the abdomen rapidly curls and uncurls. From\r\nthe rubbing of the belly against the network of nervures proceeds the\r\nspecies of puffing sound which I have compared to the hissing of an\r\nadder in a posture of defence. To imitate this curious sound it is\r\nenough rapidly to stroke the upper face of an outstretched wing with the\r\ntip of the finger-nail.\r\n\r\nIn a moment of hunger, after a fast of some days, the large grey\r\ncricket, which is as large as the Mantis or larger, will be entirely\r\nconsumed with the exception of the wings, which are too dry. Two hours\r\nare sufficient for the completion of this enormous meal. Such an orgy is\r\nrare. I have witnessed it two or three times, always asking myself where\r\nthe gluttonous creature found room for so much food, and how it\r\ncontrived to reverse in its own favour the axiom that the content is\r\nless than that which contains it. I can only admire the privileges of a\r\nstomach in which matter is digested immediately upon entrance, dissolved\r\nand made away with.\r\n\r\nThe usual diet of the Mantis under my wire cages consists of crickets of\r\ndifferent species and varying greatly in size. It is interesting to\r\nwatch the Mantis nibbling at its cricket, which it holds in the vice\r\nformed by its murderous fore-limbs. In spite of the fine-pointed muzzle,\r\nwhich hardly seems made for such ferocity, the entire insect disappears\r\nexcepting the wings, of which only the base, which is slightly fleshy,\r\nis consumed. Legs, claws, horny integuments, all else is eaten.\r\nSometimes the great hinder thigh is seized by the knuckle, carried to\r\nthe mouth, tasted, and crunched with a little air of satisfaction. The\r\nswollen thigh of the cricket might well be a choice \"cut\" for the\r\nMantis, as a leg of lamb is for us!\r\n\r\nThe attack on the victim begins at the back of the neck or base of the\r\nhead. While one of the murderous talons holds the quarry gripped by the\r\nmiddle of the body, the other presses the head downwards, so that the\r\narticulation between the back and the neck is stretched and opens\r\nslightly. The snout of the Mantis gnaws and burrows into this undefended\r\nspot with a certain persistence, and a large wound is opened in the\r\nneck. At the lesion of the cephalic ganglions the struggles of the\r\ncricket grow less, and the victim becomes a motionless corpse. Thence,\r\nunrestricted in its movements, this beast of prey chooses its mouthfuls\r\nat leisure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE MANTIS.--COURTSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little we have seen of the customs of the Mantis does not square\r\nvery well with the popular name for the insect. From the term\r\n_Prègo-Diéu_ we should expect a peaceful placid creature, devoutly\r\nself-absorbed; and we find a cannibal, a ferocious spectre, biting open\r\nthe heads of its captives after demoralising them with terror. But we\r\nhave yet to learn the worst. The customs of the Mantis in connection\r\nwith its own kin are more atrocious even than those of the spiders, who\r\nbear an ill repute in this respect.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the number of cages on my big laboratory table, to give myself\r\na little more room, while still maintaining a respectable menagerie, I\r\ninstalled several females under one cover. There was sufficient space in\r\nthe common lodging and room for the captives to move about, though for\r\nthat matter they are not fond of movement, being heavy in the abdomen.\r\nCrouching motionless against the wire work of the cover, they will\r\ndigest their food or await a passing victim. They lived, in short, just\r\nas they lived on their native bushes.\r\n\r\nCommunal life has its dangers. When the hay is low in the manger\r\ndonkeys grow quarrelsome, although usually so pacific. My guests might\r\nwell, in a season of dearth, have lost their tempers and begun to fight\r\none another; but I was careful to keep the cages well provided with\r\ncrickets, which were renewed twice a day. If civil war broke out famine\r\ncould not be urged in excuse.\r\n\r\nAt the outset matters did not go badly. The company lived in peace, each\r\nMantis pouncing upon and eating whatever came her way, without\r\ninterfering with her neighbours. But this period of concord was of brief\r\nduration. The bellies of the insects grew fuller: the eggs ripened in\r\ntheir ovaries: the time of courtship and the laying season was\r\napproaching. Then a kind of jealous rage seized the females, although no\r\nmale was present to arouse such feminine rivalry. The swelling of the\r\novaries perverted my flock, and infected them with an insane desire to\r\ndevour one another. There were threats, horrid encounters, and cannibal\r\nfeasts. Once more the spectral pose was seen, the hissing of the wings,\r\nand the terrible gesture of the talons outstretched and raised above the\r\nhead. The females could not have looked more terrible before a grey\r\ncricket or a Decticus. Without any motives that I could see, two\r\nneighbours suddenly arose in the attitude of conflict. They turned their\r\nheads to the right and the left, provoking one another, insulting one\r\nanother. The _pouf! pouf!_ of the wings rubbed by the abdomen sounded\r\nthe charge. Although the duel was to terminate at the first scratch,\r\nwithout any more serious consequence, the murderous talons, at first\r\nfolded, open like the leaves of a book, and are extended laterally to\r\nprotect the long waist and abdomen. The pose is superb, but less\r\nterrific than that assumed when the fight is to be to the death.\r\n\r\nThen one of the grappling-hooks with a sudden spring flies out and\r\nstrikes the rival; with the same suddenness it flies back and assumes a\r\nposition of guard. The adversary replies with a riposte. The fencing\r\nreminds one not a little of two cats boxing one another's ears. At the\r\nfirst sign of blood on the soft abdomen, or even at the slightest wound,\r\none admits herself to be conquered and retires. The other refurls her\r\nbattle standard and goes elsewhere to meditate the capture of a cricket,\r\napparently calm, but in reality ready to recommence the quarrel.\r\n\r\nVery often the matter turns out more tragically. In duels to the death\r\nthe pose of attack is assumed in all its beauty. The murderous talons\r\nunfold and rise in the air. Woe to the vanquished! for the victor seizes\r\nher in her vice-like grip and at once commences to eat her; beginning,\r\nneedless to say, at the back of the neck. The odious meal proceeds as\r\ncalmly as if it were merely a matter of munching a grasshopper; and the\r\nsurvivor enjoys her sister quite as much as lawful game. The spectators\r\ndo not protest, being only too willing to do the like on the first\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nFerocious creatures! It is said that even wolves do not eat one another.\r\nThe Mantis is not so scrupulous; she will eat her fellows when her\r\nfavourite quarry, the cricket, is attainable and abundant.\r\n\r\nThese observations reach a yet more revolting extreme. Let us inquire\r\ninto the habits of the insect at breeding time, and to avoid the\r\nconfusion of a crowd let us isolate the couples under different covers.\r\nThus each pair will have their own dwelling, where nothing can trouble\r\ntheir honeymoon. We will not forget to provide them with abundant food;\r\nthere shall not be the excuse of hunger for what is to follow.\r\n\r\nWe are near the end of August. The male Mantis, a slender and elegant\r\nlover, judges the time to be propitious. He makes eyes at his powerful\r\ncompanion; he turns his head towards her; he bows his neck and raises\r\nhis thorax. His little pointed face almost seems to wear an expression.\r\nFor a long time he stands thus motionless, in contemplation of the\r\ndesired one. The latter, as though indifferent, does not stir. Yet the\r\nlover has seized upon a sign of consent: a sign of which I do not know\r\nthe secret. He approaches: suddenly he erects his wings, which are\r\nshaken with a convulsive tremor.\r\n\r\nThis is his declaration. He throws himself timidly on the back of his\r\ncorpulent companion; he clings to her desperately, and steadies himself.\r\nThe prelude to the embrace is generally lengthy, and the embrace will\r\nsometimes last for five or six hours.\r\n\r\nNothing worthy of notice occurs during this time. Finally the two\r\nseparate, but they are soon to be made one flesh in a much more intimate\r\nfashion. If the poor lover is loved by his mistress as the giver of\r\nfertility, she also loves him as the choicest of game. During the day,\r\nor at latest on the morrow, he is seized by his companion, who first\r\ngnaws through the back of his neck, according to use and wont, and then\r\nmethodically devours him, mouthful by mouthful, leaving only the wings.\r\nHere we have no case of jealousy, but simply a depraved taste.\r\n\r\nI had the curiosity to wonder how a second male would be received by a\r\nnewly fecundated female. The result of my inquiry was scandalous. The\r\nMantis in only too many cases is never sated with embraces and conjugal\r\nfeasts. After a rest, of variable duration, whether the eggs have been\r\nlaid or not, a second male is welcomed and devoured like the first. A\r\nthird succeeds him, does his duty, and affords yet another meal. A\r\nfourth suffers a like fate. In the course of two weeks I have seen the\r\nsame Mantis treat seven husbands in this fashion. She admitted all to\r\nher embraces, and all paid for the nuptial ecstasy with their lives.\r\n\r\nThere are exceptions, but such orgies are frequent. On very hot days,\r\nwhen the atmospheric tension is high, they are almost the general rule.\r\nAt such times the Mantis is all nerves. Under covers which contain large\r\nhouseholds the females devour one another more frequently than ever;\r\nunder the covers which contain isolated couples the males are devoured\r\nmore eagerly than usual when their office has been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nI might urge, in mitigation of these conjugal atrocities, that the\r\nMantis does not commit them when at liberty. The male, his function once\r\nfulfilled, surely has time to wander off, to escape far away, to flee\r\nthe terrible spouse, for in my cages he is given a respite, often of a\r\nwhole day. What really happens by the roadside and in the thickets I do\r\nnot know; chance, a poor schoolmistress, has never instructed me\r\nconcerning the love-affairs of the Mantis when at liberty. I am obliged\r\nto watch events in my laboratory, where the captives, enjoying plenty of\r\nsunshine, well nourished, and comfortably lodged, do not seem in any way\r\nto suffer from nostalgia. They should behave there as they behave under\r\nnormal conditions.\r\n\r\nAlas! the facts force me to reject the statement that the males have\r\ntime to escape; for I once surprised a male, apparently in the\r\nperformance of his vital functions, holding the female tightly\r\nembraced--but he had no head, no neck, scarcely any thorax! The female,\r\nher head turned over her shoulder, was peacefully browsing on the\r\nremains of her lover! And the masculine remnant, firmly anchored,\r\ncontinued its duty!\r\n\r\nLove, it is said, is stronger than death! Taken literally, never has an\r\naphorism received a more striking confirmation. Here was a creature\r\ndecapitated, amputated as far as the middle of the thorax; a corpse\r\nwhich still struggled to give life. It would not relax its hold until\r\nthe abdomen itself, the seat of the organs of procreation, was attacked.\r\n\r\nThe custom of eating the lover after the consummation of the nuptials,\r\nof making a meal of the exhausted pigmy, who is henceforth good for\r\nnothing, is not so difficult to understand, since insects can hardly be\r\naccused of sentimentality; but to devour him during the act surpasses\r\nanything that the most morbid mind could imagine. I have seen the thing\r\nwith my own eyes, and I have not yet recovered from my surprise.\r\n\r\nCould this unfortunate creature have fled and saved himself, being thus\r\nattacked in the performance of his functions? No. We must conclude that\r\nthe loves of the Mantis are fully as tragic, perhaps even more so, than\r\nthose of the spider. I do not deny that the limited area of the cage may\r\nfavour the massacre of the males; but the cause of such butchering must\r\nbe sought elsewhere. It is perhaps a reminiscence of the carboniferous\r\nperiod when the insect world gradually took shape through prodigious\r\nprocreation. The Orthoptera, of which the Mantes form a branch, are the\r\nfirst-born of the insect world.\r\n\r\nUncouth, incomplete in their transformation, they wandered amidst the\r\narborescent foliage, already flourishing when none of the insects sprung\r\nof more complex forms of metamorphosis were as yet in existence: neither\r\nbutterflies, beetles, flies, nor bees. Manners were not gentle in those\r\nepochs, which were full of the lust to destroy in order to produce; and\r\nthe Mantis, a feeble memory of those ancient ghosts, might well preserve\r\nthe customs of an earlier age. The utilisation of the males as food is a\r\ncustom in the case of other members of the Mantis family. It is, I must\r\nadmit, a general habit. The little grey Mantis, so small and looking so\r\nharmless in her cage, which never seeks to harm her neighbours in spite\r\nof her crowded quarters, falls upon her male and devours him as\r\nferociously as the Praying Mantis. I have worn myself out in trying to\r\nprocure the indispensable complements to my female specimens. No sooner\r\nis my capture, strongly winged, vigorous and alert, introduced into the\r\ncage than he is seized, more often than not, by one of the females who\r\nno longer have need of his assistance and devoured. Once the ovaries are\r\nsatisfied the two species of Mantis conceive an antipathy for the male;\r\nor rather they regard him merely as a particularly tasty species of\r\ngame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE MANTIS.--THE NEST\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us take a more pleasant aspect of the insect whose loves are so\r\ntragic. Its nest is a marvel. In scientific language it is known as the\r\n_ootek_, or the \"egg-box.\" I shall not make use of this barbarous\r\nexpression. As one does not speak of the \"egg-box\" of the titmouse,\r\nmeaning \"the nest of the titmouse,\" why should I invoke the box in\r\nspeaking of the Mantis? It may look more scientific; but that does not\r\ninterest me.\r\n\r\nThe nest of the Praying Mantis may be found almost everywhere in places\r\nexposed to the sun: on stones, wood, vine stocks, the twigs of bushes,\r\nstems of dried grass, and even on products of human industry, such as\r\nfragments of brick, rags of heavy cloth, and pieces of old boots. Any\r\nsupport will suffice, so long as it offers inequalities to which the\r\nbase of the nest may adhere, and so provide a solid foundation. The\r\nusual dimensions of the nest are one and a half inches long by\r\nthree-quarters of an inch wide, or a trifle larger. The colour is a pale\r\ntan, like that of a grain of wheat. Brought in contact with a flame the\r\nnest burns readily, and emits an odour like that of burning silk. The\r\nmaterial of the nest is in fact a substance similar to silk, but instead\r\nof being drawn into a thread it is allowed to harden while a mass of\r\nspongy foam. If the nest is fixed on a branch the base creeps round it,\r\nenvelops the neighbouring twigs, and assumes a variable shape according\r\nto the accidents of support; if it is fixed on a flat surface the under\r\nside, which is always moulded by the support, is itself flat. The nest\r\nthen takes the form of a demi-ellipsoid, or, in other words, half an egg\r\ncut longitudinally; more or less obtuse at one end, but pointed at the\r\nother, and sometimes ending in a short curved tail.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the upper face is convex and regular. In it we can\r\ndistinguish three well-marked and longitudinal zones. The middle zone,\r\nwhich is narrower than the others, is composed of thin plates arranged\r\nin couples, and overlapping like the tiles of a roof. The edges of these\r\nplates are free, leaving two parallel series of fissures by which the\r\nyoung can issue when the eggs are hatched. In a nest recently abandoned\r\nthis zone is covered with fine cast-off skins which shiver at the least\r\nbreath, and soon disappear when exposed to the open air. I will call\r\nthis zone the zone of issue, as it is only along this bell that the\r\nyoung can escape, being set free by those that have preceded them.\r\n\r\nIn all other directions the cradle of this numerous family presents an\r\nunbroken wall. The two lateral zones, which occupy the greater part of\r\nthe demi-ellipsoid, have a perfect continuity of surface. The little\r\nMantes, which are very feeble when first hatched, could not possibly\r\nmake their way through the tenacious substance of the walls. On the\r\ninterior of these walls are a number of fine transverse furrows, signs\r\nof the various layers in which the mass of eggs is disposed.\r\n\r\nLet us cut the nest in half transversely. We shall then see that the\r\nmass of eggs constitutes an elongated core, of very firm consistency,\r\nsurrounded as to the bottom and sides by a thick porous rind, like\r\nsolidified foam. Above the eggs are the curved plates, which are set\r\nvery closely and have little freedom; their edges constituting the zone\r\nof issue, where they form a double series of small overlapping scales.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are set in a yellowish medium of horny appearance. They are\r\narranged in layers, in lines forming arcs of a circle, with the cephalic\r\nextremities converging towards the zone of issue. This orientation tells\r\nus of the method of delivery. The newly-born larvæ will slip into the\r\ninterval between two adjacent flaps or leaves, which form a prolongation\r\nof the core; they will then find a narrow passage, none too easy to\r\neffect, but sufficient, having regard to the curious provision which we\r\nshall deal with directly; they will then reach the zone of issue. There,\r\nunder the overlapping scales, two passages of exit open for each layer\r\nof eggs. Half the larvæ will issue by the right-hand passage, half by\r\nthat on the left hand. This process is repeated for each layer, from end\r\nto end of the nest.\r\n\r\nLet us sum up those structural details, which are not easily grasped\r\nunless one has the nest before one. Lying along the axis of the nest,\r\nand in shape like a date-stone, is the mass of eggs, grouped in layers.\r\nA protective rind, a kind of solidified foam, envelops this core, except\r\nat the top, along the central line, where the porous rind is replaced by\r\nthin overlapping leaves. The free edges of these leaves form the\r\nexterior of the zone of issue; they overlap one another, forming two\r\nseries of scales, leaving two exits, in the shape of narrow crevices,\r\nfor each layer of eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1.

PELLET OF THE SISYPHUS WITH DEJECTA OF THE LARVA FORCED THROUGH THE\r\nWALLS.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo be present at the construction of the nest--to learn how the Mantis\r\ncontrives to build so complex a structure--such was the main point of my\r\nresearches. I succeeded, not without difficulty, as the eggs are laid\r\nwithout warning and nearly always at night. After a great deal of futile\r\nendeavour, chance at last favoured me. On the 5th of September one of my\r\nguests, fecundated on the 29th of August, began to make her preparations\r\nunder my eyes, at four o'clock in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nOne remark before proceeding: all the nests I have obtained in the\r\nlaboratory--and I have obtained a good number--have without exception\r\nbeen built upon the wire gauze of the covers. I have been careful to\r\nprovide the insects with roughened stones and tufts of thyme, both being\r\nvery commonly used as foundations in the open fields. The captives have\r\nalways preferred the network of wire gauze, which affords a perfectly\r\nfirm foundation, as the soft material of the nest becomes incrusted upon\r\nthe meshes as it hardens.\r\n\r\nIn natural conditions the nests are never in any way sheltered; they\r\nsupport the inclemencies of winter, resist rain, wind, frost, and snow,\r\nwithout becoming detached. It is true that the female always selects an\r\nuneven support on which the foundations of the nest can be shaped, thus\r\nobtaining a firm hold. The site chosen is always the best obtainable\r\nwithin reach, and the wire gauze is constantly adopted as the best\r\nfoundation obtainable in the cages.\r\n\r\nThe only Mantis that I was able to observe at the moment of laying her\r\neggs worked upside-down, clinging to the wire near the top of the cover.\r\nMy presence, my magnifying-glass, my investigations did not disturb her\r\nin the least, so absorbed was she in her labours. I was able to lift up\r\nthe dome of wire gauze, tilt it, reverse it, turn it over and reverse it\r\nagain, without causing the insect to delay her task for a moment. I was\r\nable, with my tweezers, to raise the long wings in order to observe\r\nrather more closely what was taking place beneath them; the Mantis took\r\nabsolutely no notice of me. So far all was well; the female did not\r\nmove, and lent herself impassively to all the indiscretions of the\r\nobserver. Nevertheless, matters did not proceed as I had wished, so\r\nrapid was the operation and so difficult observation.\r\n\r\nThe end of the abdomen is constantly immersed in a blob of foam, which\r\ndoes not allow one to grasp the details of the process very clearly.\r\nThis foam is of a greyish white, slightly viscous, and almost like\r\nsoapsuds. At the moment of its appearance it adheres slightly to the end\r\nof a straw plunged into it. Two minutes later it is solidified and no\r\nlonger adheres to the straw. In a short time its consistency is that of\r\nthe substance of an old nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. THE MANTIS DEVOURING THE MALE IN THE ACT OF MATING.\r\n\r\n2. THE MANTIS COMPLETING HER NEST.\r\n\r\n3. GOLDEN SCARABÆI CUTTING UP A LOB-WORM.]\r\n\r\nThe foamy mass consists chiefly of air imprisoned in minute bubbles.\r\nThis air, which gives the nest a volume very much greater than that of\r\nthe abdomen of the Mantis, evidently does not issue from the insect\r\nalthough the foam appears at the orifice of the genital organs; it is\r\nborrowed from the atmosphere. The Mantis builds more especially with\r\nair, which is eminently adapted to protect the nest against changes\r\nof temperature. She emits a glutinous substance like the liquid\r\nsecretion of silk-worms, and with this composition, mixed\r\ninstantaneously with the outer air, she produces the foam of which the\r\nnest is constructed.\r\n\r\nShe whips the secretion as we whip white of egg, in order to make it\r\nrise and stiffen. The extremity of the abdomen opens in a long cleft,\r\nforming two lateral ladles which open and shut with a rapid, incessant\r\nmovement, beating the viscous liquid and converting it into foam as it\r\nis secreted. Beside the two oscillating ladles we see the internal\r\norgans rising and falling, protruding and retreating like a piston-rod,\r\nbut it is impossible to observe the precise nature of their action,\r\nbathed as they are in the opaque blob of foam.\r\n\r\nThe end of the abdomen, continually palpitating, rapidly closing and\r\nopening its valves, oscillates right and left like a pendulum. From each\r\nof these oscillations results a layer of eggs in the interior, and a\r\ntransversal crevice on the exterior. As it advances in the arc\r\ndescribed, suddenly, and at frequent intervals, it plunges deeper into\r\nthe foam, as though burying something at the bottom of the frothy mass.\r\nEach time it does so an egg is doubtless deposited; but the operation is\r\nso rapid, and takes place under conditions so unfavourable for\r\nobservation, that I have never once been enabled to see the oviduct at\r\nwork. I can only judge of the advent of the eggs by the movements of the\r\nend of the abdomen, which is immersed more deeply with a sudden plunging\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the viscous composition is emitted in intermittent\r\nwaves, and is beaten into a foam by the terminal valves. The foam thus\r\nobtained spreads itself over the sides and at the base of the layer of\r\neggs, and projects through the meshes of the wire gauze as a result of\r\nthe pressure of the abdomen. Thus the spongy envelope is progressively\r\ncreated as the ovaries are gradually emptied.\r\n\r\nI imagine, although I cannot speak as the result of direct observation,\r\nthat for the central core, where the eggs are surrounded by a material\r\nmore homogeneous than that of the outer shell, the Mantis must employ\r\nher secretion as it emerges, without beating it into a foam. The layer\r\nof eggs once deposited, the two valves would produce the foam required\r\nto envelop the eggs. It is extremely difficult, however, to guess what\r\noccurs beneath the veil of foam-like secretion.\r\n\r\nIn a recent nest the zone of issue is surrounded by a layer of finely\r\nporous matter, of a pure matt, almost chalky white, which contrasts\r\ndistinctly with the remainder of the nest, which is of a dirty white. It\r\nresembles the icing composition made by confectioners with whipped white\r\nof egg, sugar, and starch, for the ornamentation of cakes.\r\n\r\nThis snowy border is easily crumbled and easily detached. When it\r\ndisappears the zone of issue is clearly defined, with its double series\r\nof leaves with free edges. Exposure to the weather, wind, and rain\r\nresult in its disappearance, fragment by fragment, so that old nests\r\npreserve no trace of it.\r\n\r\nAt first sight one is tempted to regard this snowy substance as of a\r\ndifferent material to the rest of the nest. But does the Mantis really\r\nemploy two secretions? No. Anatomy, in the first place, assures us of\r\nthe unity of the materials of the nest. The organ which secretes the\r\nsubstance of the nest consists of cylindrical tubes, having a curious\r\ntangled appearance, which are arranged in two groups of twenty each.\r\nThey are all filled with a colourless, viscous fluid, which is precisely\r\nsimilar in appearance in all parts of the organ. There is no indication\r\nof any organ or secretion which could produce a chalky coloration.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the method by which the snowy band is formed rejects the idea\r\nof a different material. We see the two caudal appendices of the Mantis\r\nsweeping the surface of the foamy mass, and skimming, so to speak, the\r\ncream of the cream, gathering it together, and retaining it along the\r\nhump of the nest in such a way as to form a band like a ribbon of icing.\r\nWhat remains after this scouring process, or what oozes from the band\r\nbefore it has set, spreads over the sides of the nest in a thin layer of\r\nbubbles so fine that they cannot be distinguished without the aid of a\r\nlens.\r\n\r\nWe often see a torrent of muddy water, full of clay in suspension,\r\ncovered with great streaks and masses of foam. On this fundamental foam,\r\nso to call it, which is soiled with earthy matters, we see here and\r\nthere masses of a beautiful white foam, in which the bubbles are much\r\nsmaller. A process of selection results from variations in density, and\r\nhere and there we see foam white as snow resting on the dirty foam from\r\nwhich it is produced. Something of the kind occurs when the Mantis\r\nbuilds her nest. The two appendices whip the viscous secretion of the\r\nglands into foam. The lightest portion, whose bubbles are of the\r\ngreatest tenuity, which is white on account of its finer porosity, rises\r\nto the surface, where the caudal filaments sweep it up and gather it\r\ninto the snowy ribbon which runs along the summit of the nest.\r\n\r\nSo far, with a little patience, observation is possible and yields a\r\nsatisfactory result. It becomes impossible in the matter of the complex\r\ncentral zone, where the exits for the larvæ are contrived through the\r\ndouble series of overlapping leaves. The little I have been able to\r\nlearn amounts to this: The end of the abdomen, deeply cleft in a\r\nhorizontal direction, forms a kind of fork, of which the upper extremity\r\nremains almost motionless, while the lower continuously oscillates,\r\nproducing the foam and depositing the eggs. The creation of the central\r\nzone is certainly the work of the upper extremity.\r\n\r\nIt is always to be seen in the continuation of this central zone, in the\r\nmidst of the fine white foam gathered up by the caudal filaments. The\r\nlatter delimit the zone, one working on either side, feeling the edges\r\nof the belt, and apparently testing it and judging its progress. These\r\ntwo filaments are like two long fingers of exquisite sensitiveness,\r\nwhich direct the difficult operation.\r\n\r\nBut how are the two series of scales obtained, and the fissures, the\r\ngates of exit which they shelter? I do not know; I cannot even imagine.\r\nI leave the end of the problem to others.\r\n\r\nWhat a wonderful mechanism is this, that has the power to emit and to\r\nform, so quickly and methodically, the horny medium of the central\r\nkernel, the foam which forms the protective walls, the white creamy foam\r\nof the ribbon which runs along the central zone, the eggs, and the\r\nfecundating liquid, while at the same time it constructs the overlapping\r\nleaves, the imbricated scales, and the alternating series of open\r\nfissures! We are lost in the face of such a wonder. Yet how easily the\r\nwork is performed! Clinging to the wire gauze, forming, so to speak, the\r\naxis of her nest, the Mantis barely moves. She bestows not a glance on\r\nthe marvel which is growing behind her; her limbs are used only for\r\nsupport; they take no part in the building of the nest. The nest is\r\nbuilt, if we may say so, automatically. It is not the result of industry\r\nand the cunning of instinct; it is a purely mechanical task, which is\r\nconditioned by the implements, by the organisation of the insect. The\r\nnest, complex though it is in structure, results solely from the\r\nfunctioning of the organs, as in our human industries a host of objects\r\nare mechanically fashioned whose perfection puts the dexterity of the\r\nfingers to shame.\r\n\r\nFrom another point of view the nest of the Mantis is even more\r\nremarkable. It forms an excellent application of one of the most\r\nvaluable lessons of physical science in the matter of the conservation\r\nof heat. The Mantis has outstripped humanity in her knowledge of thermic\r\nnonconductors or insulators.\r\n\r\nThe famous physicist Rumford was responsible for a very pretty\r\nexperiment designed to demonstrate the low conductivity of air where\r\nheat other than radiant heat is concerned. The famous scientist\r\nsurrounded a frozen cheese by a mass of foam consisting of well-beaten\r\neggs. The whole was exposed to the heat of an oven. In a few minutes a\r\nlight omelette was obtained, piping hot, but the cheese in the centre\r\nwas as cold as at the outset. The air imprisoned in the bubbles of the\r\nsurrounding froth accounts for the phenomenon. Extremely refractory to\r\nheat, it had absorbed the heat of the oven and had prevented it from\r\nreaching the frozen substance in the centre of the omelette.\r\n\r\nNow, what does the Mantis do? Precisely what Rumford did; she whips her\r\nalbumen to obtain a soufflée, a froth composed of myriads of tiny\r\nair-bubbles, which will protect the germs of life contained in the\r\ncentral core. It is true that her aim is reversed; the coagulated foam\r\nof the nest is a safeguard against cold, not against heat, but what will\r\nafford protection from the one will afford protection from the other; so\r\nthat Rumford, had he wished, might equally well have maintained a hot\r\nbody at a high temperature in a refrigerator.\r\n\r\nRumford understood the athermic properties of a blanket of air-cells,\r\nthanks to the accumulated knowledge of his predecessors and his own\r\nstudies and experiments. How is it that the Mantis, for who knows how\r\nmany ages, has been able to outstrip our physicists in this problem in\r\ncalorics? How did she learn to surround her eggs with this mass of\r\nsolidifying froth, so that it was able, although fixed to a bough or a\r\nstone without other shelter, to brave with impunity the rigours of\r\nwinter?\r\n\r\nThe other Mantes found in my neighbourhood, which are the only species\r\nof which I can speak with full knowledge, employ or omit the envelope of\r\nsolidifying froth accordingly as the eggs are or are not intended to\r\nsurvive the winter. The little Grey Mantis (_Ameles decolor_), which\r\ndiffers so widely from the Praying Mantis in that the wings of the\r\nfemale are almost completely absent, builds a nest hardly as large as a\r\ncherry-stone, and covers it skilfully with a porous rind. Why this\r\ncellular envelope? Because the nest of the _Ameles_, like that of the\r\nPraying Mantis, has to endure through the winter, fixed to a stone or a\r\ntwig, and is thus exposed to the full severity of the dangerous season.\r\n\r\nThe _Empusa pauperata_, on the other hand (one of the strangest of\r\nEuropean insects), builds a nest as small as that of the _Ameles_,\r\nalthough the insect itself is as large as the Praying Mantis. This nest\r\nis quite a small structure, composed of a small number of cells,\r\narranged side by side in three or four series, sloping together at the\r\nneck. Here there is a complete absence of the porous envelope, although\r\nthe nest is exposed to the weather, like the previous examples, affixed\r\nto some twig or fragment of rock. The lack of the insulating rind is a\r\nsign of different climatic conditions. The eggs of the _Empusa_ hatch\r\nshortly after they are laid, in warm and sunny weather. Not being\r\nexposed to the asperities of the winter, they need no protection other\r\nthan the thin egg-cases themselves.\r\n\r\nAre these nice and reasonable precautions, which rival the experiment of\r\nRumford, a fortuitous result?--one of the innumerable combinations which\r\nfall from the urn of chance? If so, let us not recoil before the absurd:\r\nlet us allow that the blindness of chance is gifted with marvellous\r\nforesight.\r\n\r\nThe Praying Mantis commences her nest at the blunter extremity, and\r\ncompletes it at the pointed tail. The latter is often prolonged in a\r\nsort of promontory, in which the insect expends the last drop of\r\nglutinous liquid as she stretches herself after her task. A sitting of\r\ntwo hours, more or less, without interruption, is required for the total\r\naccomplishment of the work. Directly the period of labour is over, the\r\nmother withdraws, indifferent henceforth to her completed task. I have\r\nwatched her, half expecting to see her return, to discover some\r\ntenderness for the cradle of her family. But no: not a trace of maternal\r\npleasure. The work is done, and concerns her no longer. Crickets\r\napproach; one of them even squats upon the nest. The Mantis takes no\r\nnotice of them. They are peaceful intruders, to be sure; but even were\r\nthey dangerous, did they threaten to rifle the nest, would she attack\r\nthem and drive them away? Her impassive demeanour convinces me that she\r\nwould not. What is the nest to her? She is no longer conscious of it.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the many embraces to which the Praying Mantis submits,\r\nand of the tragic end of the male, who is almost invariably devoured as\r\nthough a lawful prey. In the space of a fortnight I have known the same\r\nfemale to adventure upon matrimony no less than seven times. Each time\r\nthe readily consoled widow devoured her mate. Such habits point to\r\nfrequent laying; and we find the appearance confirmed, though not as a\r\ngeneral rule. Some of my females gave me one nest only; others two, the\r\nsecond as capacious as the first. The most fruitful of all produced\r\nthree; of these the two first were of normal dimensions, while the third\r\nwas about half the usual size.\r\n\r\nFrom this we can reckon the productivity of the insect's ovaries. From\r\nthe transverse fissures of the median zone of the nest it is easy to\r\nestimate the layers of eggs; but these layers contain more or fewer eggs\r\naccording to their position in the middle of the nest or near the ends.\r\nThe numbers contained by the widest and narrowest layers will give us\r\nan approximate average. I find that a nest of fair size contains about\r\nfour hundred eggs. Thus the maker of the three nests, of which the last\r\nwas half as large as the others, produced no less than a thousand eggs;\r\neight hundred were deposited in the larger nests and two or three\r\nhundred in the smaller. Truly a fine family, but a thought ungainly,\r\nwere it not that only a few of its members can survive.\r\n\r\nOf a fair size, of curious structure, and well in evidence on its twig\r\nor stone, the nest of the Praying Mantis could hardly escape the\r\nattention of the Provençal peasant. It is well known in the country\r\ndistricts, where it goes by the name of _tigno_; it even enjoys a\r\ncertain celebrity. But no one seems to be aware of its origin. It is\r\nalways a surprise to my rustic neighbours when they learn that the\r\nwell-known _tigno_ is the nest of the common Mantis, the _Prègo-Diéu_.\r\nThis ignorance may well proceed from the nocturnal habits of the Mantis.\r\nNo one has caught the insect at work upon her nest in the silence of the\r\nnight. The link between the artificer and the work is missing, although\r\nboth are well known to the villager.\r\n\r\nNo matter: the singular object exists; it catches the eye, it attracts\r\nattention. It must therefore be good for something; it must possess\r\nvirtue of some kind. So in all ages have the simple reasoned, in the\r\nchildlike hope of finding in the unfamiliar an alleviation of their\r\nsorrows.\r\n\r\nBy general agreement the rural pharmacopoeia of Provence pronounces\r\nthe _tigno_ to be the best of remedies against chilblains. The method of\r\nemployment is of the simplest. The nest is cut in two, squeezed and the\r\naffected part is rubbed with the cut surface as the juices flow from\r\nit. This specific, I am told, is sovereign. All sufferers from blue and\r\nswollen fingers should without fail, according to traditional usage,\r\nhave recourse to the _tigno_.\r\n\r\nIs it really efficacious? Despite the general belief, I venture to doubt\r\nit, after fruitless experiments on my own fingers and those of other\r\nmembers of my household during the winter of 1895, when the severe and\r\npersistent cold produced an abundant crop of chilblains. None of us,\r\ntreated with the celebrated unguent, observed the swelling to diminish;\r\nnone of us found that the pain and discomfort was in the least assuaged\r\nby the sticky varnish formed by the juices of the crushed _tigno_. It is\r\nnot easy to believe that others are more successful, but the popular\r\nrenown of the specific survives in spite of all, probably thanks to a\r\nsimple accident of identity between the name of the remedy and that of\r\nthe infirmity: the Provençal for \"chilblain\" is _tigno_. From the moment\r\nwhen the chilblain and the nest of the Mantis were known by the same\r\nname were not the virtues of the latter obvious? So are reputations\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nIn my own village, and doubtless to some extent throughout the Midi, the\r\n_tigno_--the nest of the Mantis, not the chilblain--is also reputed as a\r\nmarvellous cure for toothache. It is enough to carry it upon the person\r\nto be free of that lamentable affection. Women wise in such matters\r\ngather them beneath a propitious moon, and preserve them piously in some\r\ncorner of the clothes-press or wardrobe. They sew them in the lining of\r\nthe pocket, lest they should be pulled out with the handkerchief and\r\nlost; they will grant the loan of them to a neighbour tormented by some\r\nrefractory molar. \"Lend me thy _tigno_: I am suffering martyrdom!\" begs\r\nthe owner of a swollen face.--\"Don't on any account lose it!\" says the\r\nlender: \"I haven't another, and we aren't at the right time of moon!\"\r\n\r\nWe will not laugh at the credulous victim; many a remedy triumphantly\r\npuffed on the latter pages of the newspapers and magazines is no more\r\neffectual. Moreover, this rural simplicity is surpassed by certain old\r\nbooks which form the tomb of the science of a past age. An English\r\nnaturalist of the sixteenth century, the well-known physician, Thomas\r\nMoffat, informs us that children lost in the country would inquire their\r\nway of the Mantis. The insect consulted would extend a limb, indicating\r\nthe direction to be taken, and, says the author, scarcely ever was the\r\ninsect mistaken. This pretty story is told in Latin, with an adorable\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN GARDENER.--ITS NUTRIMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn writing the first lines of this chapter I am reminded of the\r\nslaughter-pens of Chicago; of those horrible meat factories which in the\r\ncourse of the year cut up one million and eighty thousand bullocks and\r\nseventeen hundred thousand swine, which enter a train of machinery alive\r\nand issue transformed into cans of preserved meat, sausages, lard, and\r\nrolled hams. I am reminded of these establishments because the beetle I\r\nam about to speak of will show us a compatible celerity of butchery.\r\n\r\nIn a spacious, glazed insectorium I have twenty-five Carabi aurati. At\r\npresent they are motionless, lying beneath a piece of board which I gave\r\nthem for shelter. Their bellies cooled by the sand, their backs warmed\r\nby the board, which is visited by the sun, they slumber and digest their\r\nfood. By good luck I chance upon a procession of pine-caterpillars, in\r\nprocess of descending from their tree in search of a spot suitable for\r\nburial, the prelude to the phase of the subterranean chrysalis. Here is\r\nan excellent flock for the slaughter-house of the Carabi.\r\n\r\nI capture them and place them in the insectorium. The procession is\r\nquickly re-formed; the caterpillars, to the number of perhaps a hundred\r\nand fifty, move forward in an undulating line. They pass near the piece\r\nof board, one following the other like the pigs at Chicago. The moment\r\nis propitious. I cry Havoc! and let loose the dogs of war: that is to\r\nsay, I remove the plank.\r\n\r\nThe sleepers immediately awake, scenting the abundant prey. One of them\r\nruns forward; three, four, follow; the whole assembly is aroused; those\r\nwho are buried emerge; the whole band of cut-throats falls upon the\r\npassing flock. It is a sight never to be forgotten. The mandibles of the\r\nbeetles are at work in all directions; the procession is attacked in the\r\nvan, in the rear, in the centre; the victims are wounded on the back or\r\nthe belly at random. The furry skins are gaping with wounds; their\r\ncontents escape in knots of entrails, bright green with their aliment,\r\nthe needles of the pine-tree; the caterpillars writhe, struggling with\r\nloop-like movements, gripping the sand with their feet, dribbling and\r\ngnashing their mandibles. Those as yet unwounded are digging desperately\r\nin the attempt to take refuge underground. Not one succeeds. They are\r\nscarcely half buried before some beetle runs to them and destroys them\r\nby an eviscerating wound.\r\n\r\nIf this massacre did not occur in a dumb world we should hear all the\r\nhorrible tumult of the slaughter-houses of Chicago. But only the ear of\r\nthe mind can hear the shrieks and lamentations of the eviscerated\r\nvictims. For myself, I possess this ear, and am full of remorse for\r\nhaving provoked such sufferings.\r\n\r\nNow the beetles are rummaging in all directions through the heap of\r\ndead and dying, each tugging and tearing at a morsel which he carries\r\noff to swallow in peace, away from the inquisitive eyes of his fellows.\r\nThis mouthful disposed of, another is hastily cut from the body of some\r\nvictim, and the process is repeated so long as there are bodies left. In\r\na few minutes the procession is reduced to a few shreds of still\r\npalpitating flesh.\r\n\r\nThere were a hundred and fifty caterpillars; the butchers were\r\ntwenty-five. This amounts to six victims dispatched by each beetle. If\r\nthe insect had nothing to do but to kill, like the knackers in the meat\r\nfactories, and if the staff numbered a hundred--a very modest figure as\r\ncompared with the staff of a lard or bacon factory--then the total\r\nnumber of victims, in a day of ten hours, would be thirty-six thousand.\r\nNo Chicago \"cannery\" ever rivalled such a result.\r\n\r\nThe speed of assassination is the more remarkable when we consider the\r\ndifficulties of attack. The beetle has no endless chain to seize its\r\nvictim by one leg, hoist it up, and swing it along to the butcher's\r\nknife; it has no sliding plank to hold the victim's head beneath the\r\npole-axe of the knacker; it has to fall upon its prey, overpower it, and\r\navoid its feet and its mandibles. Moreover, the beetle eats its prey on\r\nthe spot as it kills. What slaughter there would be if the insect\r\nconfined itself to killing!\r\n\r\nWhat do we learn from the slaughter-houses of Chicago and the fate of\r\nthe beetle's victims? This: That the man of elevated morality is so far\r\na very rare exception. Under the skin of the civilised being there lurks\r\nalmost always the ancestor, the savage contemporary of the cave-bear.\r\nTrue humanity does not yet exist; it is growing, little by little,\r\ncreated by the ferment of the centuries and the dictates of conscience;\r\nbut it progresses towards the highest with heartbreaking slowness.\r\n\r\nIt was only yesterday that slavery finally disappeared: the basis of the\r\nancient social organism; only yesterday was it realised that man, even\r\nthough black, is really man and deserves to be treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nWhat formerly was woman? She was what she is to-day in the East: a\r\ngentle animal without a soul. The question was long discussed by the\r\nlearned. The great divine of the seventeenth century, Bossuet himself,\r\nregarded woman as the diminutive of man. The proof was in the origin of\r\nEve: she was the superfluous bone, the thirteenth rib which Adam\r\npossessed in the beginning. It has at last been admitted that woman\r\npossesses a soul like our own, but even superior in tenderness and\r\ndevotion. She has been allowed to educate herself, which she has done at\r\nleast as zealously as her coadjutor. But the law, that gloomy cavern\r\nwhich is still the lurking-place of so many barbarities, continues to\r\nregard her as an incapable and a minor. The law in turn will finally\r\nsurrender to the truth.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of slavery and the education of woman: these are two\r\nenormous strides upon the path of moral progress. Our descendants will\r\ngo farther. They will see, with a lucidity capable of piercing every\r\nobstacle, that war is the most hopeless of all absurdities. That our\r\nconquerors, victors of battles and destroyers of nations, are detestable\r\nscourges; that a clasp of the hand is preferable to a rifle-shot; that\r\nthe happiest people is not that which possesses the largest battalions,\r\nbut that which labours in peace and produces abundantly; and that the\r\namenities of existence do not necessitate the existence of frontiers,\r\nbeyond which we meet with all the annoyances of the custom-house, with\r\nits officials who search our pockets and rifle our luggage.\r\n\r\nOur descendants will see this and many other marvels which to-day are\r\nextravagant dreams. To what ideal height will the process of evolution\r\nlead mankind? To no very magnificent height, it is to be feared. We are\r\nafflicted by an indelible taint, a kind of original sin, if we may call\r\nsin a state of things with which our will has nothing to do. We are made\r\nafter a certain pattern and we can do nothing to change ourselves. We\r\nare marked with the mark of the beast, the taint of the belly, the\r\ninexhaustible source of bestiality.\r\n\r\nThe intestine rules the world. In the midst of our most serious affairs\r\nthere intrudes the imperious question of bread and butter. So long as\r\nthere are stomachs to digest--and as yet we are unable to dispense with\r\nthem--we must find the wherewithal to fill them, and the powerful will\r\nlive by the sufferings of the weak. Life is a void that only death can\r\nfill. Hence the endless butchery by which man nourishes himself, no less\r\nthan beetles and other creatures; hence the perpetual holocausts which\r\nmake of this earth a knacker's yard, beside which the slaughter-houses\r\nof Chicago are as nothing.\r\n\r\nBut the feasters are legion, and the feast is not abundant in\r\nproportion. Those that have not are envious of those that have; the\r\nhungry bare their teeth at the satisfied. Then follows the battle for\r\nthe right of possession. Man raises armies; to defend his harvests, his\r\ngranaries, and his cellars, he resorts to warfare. When shall we see the\r\nend of it? Alas, and many times alas! As long as there are wolves in the\r\nworld there must be watch-dogs to defend the flock.\r\n\r\nThis train of thought has led us far away from our beetles. Let us\r\nreturn to them. What was my motive in provoking the massacre of this\r\npeaceful procession of caterpillars who were on the point of self-burial\r\nwhen I gave them over to the butchers? Was it to enjoy the spectacle of\r\na frenzied massacre? By no means; I have always pitied the sufferings of\r\nanimals, and the smallest life is worthy of respect. To overcome this\r\npity there needed the exigencies of scientific research--exigencies\r\nwhich are often cruel.\r\n\r\nIn this case the subject of research was the habits of the Carabus\r\nauratus, the little vermin-killer of our gardens, who is therefore\r\nvulgarly known as the Gardener Beetle. How far is this title deserved?\r\nWhat game does the Gardener Beetle hunt? From what vermin does he free\r\nour beds and borders? His dealings with the procession of\r\npine-caterpillars promise much. Let us continue our inquiry.\r\n\r\nOn various occasions about the end of April the gardens afford me the\r\nsight of such processions, sometimes longer, sometimes shorter. I\r\ncapture them and place them in the vivarium. Bloodshed commences the\r\nmoment the banquet is served. The caterpillars are eviscerated; each by\r\na single beetle, or by several simultaneously. In less than fifteen\r\nminutes the flock is completely exterminated. Nothing remains but a few\r\nshapeless fragments, which are carried hither and thither, to be\r\nconsumed at leisure under the shelter of the wooden board. One well-fed\r\nbeetle decamps, his booty in his jaws, hoping to finish his feast in\r\npeace. He is met by companions who are attracted by the morsel hanging\r\nfrom the mandibles of the fugitive, and audaciously attempt to rob him.\r\nFirst two, then three, they all endeavour to deprive the legitimate\r\nowner of his prize. Each seizes the fragment, tugs at it, commences to\r\nswallow it without further ado. There is no actual battle; no violent\r\nassaults, as in the case of dogs disputing a bone. Their efforts are\r\nconfined to the attempted theft. If the legitimate owner retains his\r\nhold they consume his booty in common, mandibles to mandibles, until the\r\nfragment is torn or bitten through, and each retires with his mouthful.\r\n\r\nAs I found to my cost in bygone experiments, the pine-caterpillar wields\r\na violently corrosive poison, which produces a painful rash upon the\r\nhands. It must therefore, one would think, form a somewhat highly\r\nseasoned diet. The beetles, however, delight in it. No matter how many\r\nflocks I provide them with, they are all consumed. But no one, that I\r\nknow of, has ever found the Golden Gardener and its larva in the silken\r\ncocoons of the Bombyx. I do not expect ever to make such a discovery.\r\nThese cocoons are inhabited only in winter, when the Gardener is\r\nindifferent to food, and lies torpid in the earth. In April, however,\r\nwhen the processions of larvæ are seeking a suitable site for burial and\r\nmetamorphosis, the Gardener should profit largely by its good fortune\r\nshould it by any chance encounter them.\r\n\r\nThe furry nature of the victim does not in the least incommode the\r\nbeetle; but the hairiest of all our caterpillars, the Hedgehog\r\nCaterpillar, with its undulating mane, partly red and partly black, does\r\nseem to be too much for the beetle. Day after day it wanders about the\r\nvivarium in company with the assassins. The latter apparently ignore its\r\npresence. From time to time one of them will halt, stroll round the\r\nhairy creature, examine it, and try to penetrate the tangled fleece.\r\nImmediately repulsed by the long, dense palisade of hairs, he retires\r\nwithout inflicting a wound, and the caterpillar proceeds upon its way\r\nwith undulating mane, in pride and security.\r\n\r\nBut this state of things cannot last. In a hungry moment, emboldened\r\nmoreover by the presence of his fellows, the cowardly creature decides\r\nupon a serious attack. There are four of them; they industriously attack\r\nthe caterpillar, which finally succumbs, assaulted before and behind. It\r\nis eviscerated and swallowed as greedily as though it were a defenceless\r\ngrub.\r\n\r\nAccording to the hazard of discovery, I provision my menagerie with\r\nvarious caterpillars, some smooth and others hairy. All are accepted\r\nwith the utmost eagerness, so long as they are of average size as\r\ncompared with the beetles themselves. If too small they are despised, as\r\nthey would not yield a sufficient mouthful. If they are too large the\r\nbeetle is unable to handle them. The caterpillars of the Sphinx moth and\r\nthe Great Peacock moth, for example, would fall an easy prey to the\r\nbeetle were it not that at the first bite of the assailant the intended\r\nvictim, by a contortion of its powerful flanks, sends the former\r\nflying. After several attacks, all of which end by the beetle being\r\nflung back to some considerable distance, the insect regretfully\r\nabandons his prey. I have kept two strong and lively caterpillars for a\r\nfortnight in the cage of my golden beetles, and nothing more serious\r\noccurred. The trick of the suddenly extended posterior was too much for\r\nthe ferocious mandibles.\r\n\r\nThe chief utility of the Golden Gardener lies in its extermination of\r\nall caterpillars that are not too powerful to attack. It has one\r\nlimitation, however: it is not a climber. It hunts on the ground; never\r\nin the foliage overhead. I have never seen it exploring the twigs of\r\neven the smallest of bushes. When caged it pays no attention to the most\r\nenticing caterpillars if the latter take refuge in a tuft of thyme, at a\r\nfew inches above the ground. This is a great pity. If only the beetle\r\ncould climb how rapidly three or four would rid our cabbages of that\r\ngrievous pest, the larva of the white cabbage butterfly! Alas! the best\r\nhave always some failing, some vice.\r\n\r\nTo exterminate caterpillars: that is the true vocation of the Golden\r\nGardener. It is annoying that it can give us but little or no assistance\r\nin ridding us of another plague of the kitchen-garden: the snail. The\r\nslime of the snail is offensive to the beetle; it is safe from the\r\nlatter unless crippled, half crushed, or projecting from the shell. Its\r\nrelatives, however, do not share this dislike. The horny Procrustes, the\r\ngreat Scarabicus, entirely black and larger than the Carabus, attacks\r\nthe snail most valiantly, and empties its shell to the bottom, in spite\r\nof the desperate secretion of slime. It is a pity that the Procrustes is\r\nnot more frequently found in our gardens; it would be an excellent\r\ngardener's assistant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN GARDENER--COURTSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is generally recognized that the Carabus auratus is an active\r\nexterminator of caterpillars; on this account in particular it deserves\r\nits title of Gardener Beetle; it is the vigilant policeman of our\r\nkitchen-gardens, our flower-beds and herbaceous borders. If my inquiries\r\nadd nothing to its established reputation in this respect, they will\r\nnevertheless, in the following pages, show the insect in a light as yet\r\nunsuspected. The ferocious beast of prey, the ogre who devours all\r\ncreatures that are not too strong for him, is himself killed and eaten:\r\nby his fellows, and by many others.\r\n\r\nStanding one day in the shadow of the plane-trees that grow before my\r\ndoor, I see a Golden Gardener go by as if on pressing business. The\r\npilgrim is well met; he will go to swell the contents of my vivarium. In\r\ncapturing him I notice that the extremities of the wing-covers are\r\nslightly damaged. Is this the result of a struggle between rivals? There\r\nis nothing to tell me. The essential thing is that the insect should not\r\nbe handicapped by any serious injury. Inspected, and found to be without\r\nany serious wound and fit for service, it is introduced into the glass\r\ndwelling of its twenty-five future companions.\r\n\r\nNext day I look for the new inmate. It is dead. Its comrades have\r\nattacked it during the night and have cleaned out its abdomen,\r\ninsufficiently protected by the damaged wing-covers. The operation has\r\nbeen performed very cleanly, without any dismemberment. Claws, head,\r\ncorselet, all are correctly in place; the abdomen only has a gaping\r\nwound through which its contents have been removed. What remains is a\r\nkind of golden shell, formed of the two conjoined elytra. The shell of\r\nan oyster emptied of its inmate is not more empty.\r\n\r\nThis result astonishes me, for I have taken good care that the cage\r\nshould never be long without food. The snail, the pine-cockchafer, the\r\nPraying Mantis, the lob-worm, the caterpillar, and other favourite\r\ninsects, have all been given in alternation and in sufficient\r\nquantities. In devouring a brother whose damaged armour lent itself to\r\nany easy attack my beetles had not the excuse of hunger.\r\n\r\nIs it their custom to kill the wounded and to eviscerate such of their\r\nfellows as suffer damage? Pity is unknown among insects. At the sight of\r\nthe desperate struggles of a crippled fellow-creature none of the same\r\nfamily will cry a halt, none will attempt to come to its aid. Among the\r\ncarnivorous insects the matter may develop to a tragic termination. With\r\nthem, the passers-by will often run to the cripple. But do they do so in\r\norder to help it? By no means: merely to taste its flesh, and, if they\r\nfind it agreeable, to perform the most radical cure of its ills by\r\ndevouring it.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, therefore, that the Gardener with the injured\r\nwing-covers had tempted his fellows by the sight of his imperfectly\r\ncovered back. They saw in their defenceless comrade a permissible\r\nsubject for dissection. But do they respect one another when there is no\r\nprevious wound? At first there was every appearance that their relations\r\nwere perfectly pacific. During their sanguinary meals there is never a\r\nscuffle between the feasters; nothing but mere mouth-to-mouth thefts.\r\nThere are no quarrels during the long siestas in the shelter of the\r\nboard. Half buried in the cool earth, my twenty-five subjects slumber\r\nand digest their food in peace; they lie sociably near one another, each\r\nin his little trench. If I raise the plank they awake and are off,\r\nrunning hither and thither, constantly encountering one another without\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nThe profoundest peace is reigning, and to all appearances will last for\r\never, when in the early days of June I find a dead Gardener. Its limbs\r\nare intact; it is reduced to the condition of a mere golden husk; like\r\nthe defenceless beetle I have already spoken of, it is as empty as an\r\noyster-shell. Let us examine the remains. All is intact, save the huge\r\nbreach in the abdomen. So the insect was sound and unhurt when the\r\nothers attacked it.\r\n\r\nA few days pass, and another Gardener is killed and dealt with as\r\nbefore, with no disorder in the component pieces of its armour. Let us\r\nplace the dead insect on its belly; it is to all appearances untouched.\r\nPlace it on its back; it is hollow, and has no trace of flesh left\r\nbeneath its carapace. A little later, and I find another empty relic;\r\nthen another, and yet another, until the population of my menagerie is\r\nrapidly shrinking. If this insensate massacre continues I shall soon\r\nfind my cage depopulated.\r\n\r\nAre my beetles hoary with age? Do they die a natural death, and do the\r\nsurvivors then clean out the bodies? Or is the population being reduced\r\nat the expense of sound and healthy insects? It is not easy to elucidate\r\nthe matter, since the atrocities are commonly perpetrated in the night.\r\nBut, finally, with vigilance, on two occasions, I surprise the beetles\r\nat their work in the light of day.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of June a female attacks a male before my eyes. The\r\nmale is recognisable by his slightly smaller size. The operation\r\ncommences. Raising the ends of the wing-covers, the assailant seizes her\r\nvictim by the extremity of the abdomen, from the dorsal side. She pulls\r\nat him furiously, eagerly munching with her mandibles. The victim, who\r\nis in the prime of life, does not defend himself, nor turn upon his\r\nassailant. He pulls his hardest in the opposite direction to free\r\nhimself from those terrible fangs; he advances and recoils as he is\r\noverpowered by or overpowers the assassin; and there his resistance\r\nends. The struggle lasts a quarter of an hour. Other beetles, passing\r\nby, call a halt, and seem to say \"My turn next!\" Finally, redoubling his\r\nefforts, the male frees himself and flies. If he had not succeeded in\r\nescaping the ferocious female would undoubtedly have eviscerated him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GOLDEN GARDENER: THE MATING SEASON OVER, THE MALES\r\nARE EVISCERATED BY THE FEMALES.]\r\n\r\nA few days later I witness a similar scene, but this time the tragedy is\r\nplayed to the end. Once more it is a female who seizes a male from\r\nbehind. With no other protest except his futile efforts to escape, the\r\nvictim is forced to submit. The skin finally yields; the wound\r\nenlarges, and the viscera are removed and devoured by the matron, who\r\nempties the carapace, her head buried in the body of her late companion.\r\nThe legs of the miserable victim tremble, announcing the end. The\r\nmurderess takes no notice; she continues to rummage as far as she can\r\nreach for the narrowing of the thorax. Nothing is left but the closed\r\nboat-shaped wing-covers and the fore parts of the body. The empty shell\r\nis left lying on the scene of the tragedy.\r\n\r\nIn this way must have perished the beetles--always males--whose remains\r\nI find in the cage from time to time; thus the survivors also will\r\nperish. Between the middle of June and the 1st of August the inhabitants\r\nof the cage, twenty-five in number at the outset, are reduced to five,\r\nall of whom are females. All the males, to the number of twenty, have\r\ndisappeared, eviscerated and completely emptied. And by whom? Apparently\r\nby the females.\r\n\r\nThat this is the case is attested in the first place by the two assaults\r\nof which I was perchance the witness; on two occasions, in broad\r\ndaylight, I saw the female devouring the male, having opened the abdomen\r\nunder the wing-covers, or having at least attempted to do so. As for the\r\nrest of the massacres, although direct observation was lacking, I had\r\none very valuable piece of evidence. As we have seen, the victim does\r\nnot retaliate, does not defend himself, but simply tries to escape by\r\npulling himself away.\r\n\r\nIf it were a matter of an ordinary fight, a conflict such as might arise\r\nin the struggle for life, the creature attacked would obviously\r\nretaliate, since he is perfectly well able to do so; in an ordinary\r\nconflict he would meet force by force, and return bite for bite. His\r\nstrength would enable him to come well out of a struggle, but the\r\nfoolish creature allows himself to be devoured without retaliating. It\r\nseems as though an invincible repugnance prevents him from offering\r\nresistance and in turn devouring the devourer. This tolerance reminds\r\none of the scorpion of Languedoc, which on the termination of the\r\nhymeneal rites allows the female to devour him without attempting to\r\nemploy his weapon, the venomous dagger which would form a formidable\r\ndefence; it reminds us also of the male of the Praying Mantis, which\r\nstill embraces the female though reduced to a headless trunk, while the\r\nlatter devours him by small mouthfuls, with no rebellion or defence on\r\nhis part. There are other examples of hymeneal rites to which the male\r\noffers no resistance.\r\n\r\nThe males of my menagerie of Gardeners, one and all eviscerated, speak\r\nof similar customs. They are the victims of the females when the latter\r\nhave no further use for them. For four months, from April to August, the\r\ninsects pair off continually; sometimes tentatively, but usually the\r\nmating is effective. The business of mating is all but endless for these\r\nfiery spirits.\r\n\r\nThe Gardener is prompt and businesslike in his affairs of the heart. In\r\nthe midst of the crowd, with no preliminary courtship, the male throws\r\nhimself upon the female. The female thus embraced raises her head a\r\ntrifle as a sign of acquiescence, while the cavalier beats the back of\r\nher neck with his antennæ. The embrace is brief, and they abruptly\r\nseparate; after a little refreshment the two parties are ready for other\r\nadventures, and yet others, so long as there are males available. After\r\nthe feast, a brief and primitive wooing; after the wooing, the feast; in\r\nsuch delights the life of the Gardener passes.\r\n\r\nThe females of my collection were in no proper ratio to the number of\r\naspiring lovers; there were five females to twenty males. No matter;\r\nthere was no rivalry, no hustling; all went peacefully and sooner or\r\nlater each was satisfied.\r\n\r\nI should have preferred a better proportioned assembly. Chance, not\r\nchoice, had given me that at my disposal. In the early spring I had\r\ncollected all the Gardeners I could find under the stones of the\r\nneighbourhood, without distinguishing the sexes, for they are not easy\r\nto recognise merely by external characteristics. Later on I learned by\r\nwatching them that a slight excess of size was the distinctive sign of\r\nthe female. My menagerie, so ill-proportioned in the matter of sex, was\r\ntherefore the result of chance. I do not suppose this preponderance of\r\nmales exists in natural conditions. On the other hand, one never sees\r\nsuch numerous groups at liberty, in the shelter of the same stone. The\r\nGardener lives an almost solitary life; it is rarely that one finds two\r\nor three beneath the same object of shelter. The gathering in my\r\nmenagerie was thus exceptional, although it did not lead to confusion.\r\nThere is plenty of room in the glass cage for excursions to a distance\r\nand for all their habitual manoeuvres. Those who wish for solitude can\r\nobtain it; those who wish for company need not seek it.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, captivity cannot lie heavily on them; that is proved by\r\ntheir frequent feasts, their constant mating. They could not thrive\r\nbetter in the open; perhaps not so well, for food is less abundant under\r\nnatural conditions. In the matter of well-being the prisoners are in a\r\nnormal condition, favourable to the maintenance of their usual habits.\r\n\r\nIt is true that encounters of beetle with beetle are more frequent here\r\nthan in the open. Hence, no doubt, arise more opportunities for the\r\nfemales to persecute the males whom they no longer require; to fall upon\r\nthem from the rear and eviscerate them. This pursuit of their onetime\r\nlovers is aggravated by their confined quarters; but it certainly is not\r\ncaused thereby, for such customs are not suddenly originated.\r\n\r\nThe mating season over, the female encountering a male in the open must\r\nevidently regard him as fair game, and devour him as the termination of\r\nthe matrimonial rites. I have turned over many stones, but have never\r\nchanced upon this spectacle, but what has occurred in my menagerie is\r\nsufficient to convince me. What a world these beetles live in, where the\r\nmatron devours her mate so soon as her fertility delivers her from the\r\nneed of him! And how lightly the males must be regarded by custom, to be\r\nserved in this manner!\r\n\r\nIs this practice of post-matrimonial cannibalism a general custom in the\r\ninsect world? For the moment, I can recollect only three characteristic\r\nexamples: those of the Praying Mantis, the Golden Gardener, and the\r\nscorpion of Languedoc. An analogous yet less brutal practice--for the\r\nvictim is defunct before he is eaten--is a characteristic of the Locust\r\nfamily. The female of the white-faced Decticus will eagerly devour the\r\nbody of her dead mate, as will the Green Grasshopper.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent this custom is excused by the nature of the insect's\r\ndiet; the Decticus and the Grasshopper are essentially carnivorous.\r\nEncountering a dead body of their own species, a female will devour it,\r\neven if it be the body of her latest mate.\r\n\r\nBut what are we to say in palliation of the vegetarians? At the approach\r\nof the breeding season, before the eggs are laid, the Ephippigera turns\r\nupon her still living mate, disembowels him, and eats as much of him as\r\nher appetite will allow.\r\n\r\nThe cheerful Cricket shows herself in a new light at this season; she\r\nattacks the mate who lately wooed her with such impassioned serenades;\r\nshe tears his wings, breaks his musical thighs, and even swallows a few\r\nmouthfuls of the instrumentalist. It is probable that this deadly\r\naversion of the female for the male at the end of the mating season is\r\nfairly common, especially among the carnivorous insects. But what is the\r\nobject of this atrocious custom? That is a question I shall not fail to\r\nanswer when circumstances permit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE FIELD-CRICKET\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breeding of Crickets demands no particular preparations. A little\r\npatience is enough--patience, which according to Buffon is genius; but\r\nwhich I, more modestly, will call the superlative virtue of the\r\nobserver. In April, May, or later we may establish isolated couples in\r\nordinary flower-pots containing a layer of beaten earth. Their diet will\r\nconsist of a leaf of lettuce renewed from time to time. The pot must be\r\ncovered with a square of glass to prevent the escape of the inmates.\r\n\r\nI have gathered some very curious data from these makeshift appliances,\r\nwhich may be used with and as a substitute for the cages of wire gauze,\r\nalthough the latter are preferable. We shall return to the point\r\npresently. For the moment let us watch the process of breeding, taking\r\ncare that the critical hour does not escape us.\r\n\r\nIt was during the first week of June that my assiduous visits were at\r\nlast repaid. I surprised the female motionless, with the oviduct planted\r\nvertically in the soil. Heedless of the indiscreet visitor, she remained\r\nfor a long time stationed at the same point. Finally she withdrew her\r\noviduct, and effaced, though without particular care, the traces of the\r\nhole in which her eggs were deposited, rested for a moment, walked\r\naway, and repeated the operation; not once, but many times, first here,\r\nthen there, all over the area at her disposal. Her behaviour was\r\nprecisely the same as that of the Decticus, except that her movements\r\nwere more deliberate. At the end of twenty-four hours her eggs were\r\napparently all laid. For greater certainty I waited a couple of days\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nI then examined the earth in the pot. The eggs, of a straw-yellow, are\r\ncylindrical in form, with rounded ends, and measure about one-tenth of\r\nan inch in length. They are placed singly in the soil, in a\r\nperpendicular position.\r\n\r\nI have found them over the whole area of the pot, at a depth of a\r\ntwelfth of an inch. As closely as the difficulties of the operation will\r\nallow, I have estimated the eggs of a single female, upon passing the\r\nearth through a sieve, at five or six hundred. Such a family will\r\ncertainly undergo an energetic pruning before very long.\r\n\r\nThe egg of the Cricket is a curiosity, a tiny mechanical marvel. After\r\nhatching it appears as a sheath of opaque white, open at the summit,\r\nwhere there is a round and very regular aperture, to the edge of which\r\nadheres a little valve like a skull-cap which forms the lid. Instead of\r\nbreaking at random under the thrusts or the cuts of the new-formed\r\nlarva, it opens of itself along a line of least resistance which occurs\r\nexpressly for the purpose. The curious process of the actual hatching\r\nshould be observed.\r\n\r\nA fortnight after the egg is laid two large eye-marks, round and of a\r\nreddish black, are seen to darken the forward extremity of the egg.\r\nNext, a little above these two points, and right at the end of the\r\ncylinder, a tiny circular capsule or swelling is seen. This marks the\r\nline of rupture, which is now preparing. Presently the translucency of\r\nthe egg allows us to observe the fine segmentation of the tiny inmate.\r\nNow is the moment to redouble our vigilance and to multiply our visits,\r\nespecially during the earlier part of the day.\r\n\r\nFortune favours the patient, and rewards my assiduity Round the little\r\ncapsule changes of infinite delicacy have prepared the line of least\r\nresistance. The end of the egg, pushed by the head of the inmate,\r\nbecomes detached, rises, and falls aside like the top of a tiny phial.\r\nThe Cricket issues like a Jack-in-the-box.\r\n\r\nWhen the Cricket has departed the shell remains distended, smooth,\r\nintact, of the purest white, with the circular lid hanging to the mouth\r\nof the door of exit. The egg of the bird breaks clumsily under the blows\r\nof a wart-like excrescence which is formed expressly upon the beak of\r\nthe unborn bird; the egg of the Cricket, of a far superior structure,\r\nopens like an ivory casket. The pressure of the inmate's head is\r\nsufficient to work the hinge.\r\n\r\nThe moment he is deprived of his white tunic, the young Cricket, pale\r\nall over, almost white, begins to struggle against the overlying soil.\r\nHe strikes it with his mandibles; he sweeps it aside, kicking it\r\nbackwards and downwards; and being of a powdery quality, which offers no\r\nparticular resistance, he soon arrives at the surface, and henceforth\r\nknows the joys of the sun, and the perils of intercourse with the\r\nliving; a tiny, feeble creature, little larger than a flea. His colour\r\ndeepens. In twenty-four hours he assumes a splendid ebony black which\r\nrivals that of the adult insect. Of his original pallor he retains only\r\na white girdle which encircles the thorax and reminds one of the\r\nleading-string of an infant.\r\n\r\nVery much on the alert, he sounds his surroundings with his long\r\nvibrating antennæ; he toddles and leaps along with a vigour which his\r\nfuture obesity will no longer permit.\r\n\r\nThis is the age of stomach troubles. What are we to give him to eat? I\r\ndo not know. I offer him adult diet--the tender leaves of a lettuce. He\r\ndisdains to bite it; or perhaps his bites escape me, so tiny would they\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nIn a few days, what with my ten households, I see myself loaded with\r\nfamily cares. What shall I do with my five or six thousand Crickets, an\r\nattractive flock, to be sure, but one I cannot bring up in my ignorance\r\nof the treatment required? I will give you liberty, gentle creatures! I\r\nwill confide you to the sovereign nurse and schoolmistress, Nature!\r\n\r\nIt is done. Here and there about my orchard, in the most favourable\r\nlocalities, I loose my legions. What a concert I shall have before my\r\ndoor next year if all goes well! But no! There will probably be silence,\r\nfor the terrible extermination will follow which corresponds with the\r\nfertility of the mother. A few couples only may survive: that is the\r\nmost we can hope.\r\n\r\nThe first to come to the living feast and the most eager at the\r\nslaughter are the little grey lizard and the ant. I am afraid this\r\nlatter, hateful filibuster that it is, will not leave me a single\r\nCricket in my garden. It falls upon the tiny Crickets, eviscerates them,\r\nand devours them with frantic greed.\r\n\r\nSatanic creature! And to think that we place it in the front rank of\r\nthe insect world! The books celebrate its virtues and never tire of its\r\npraises; the naturalists hold it in high esteem and add to its\r\nreputation daily; so true is it of animals, as of man, that of the\r\nvarious means of living in history the most certain is to do harm to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nEvery one knows the _Bousier_ (dung-beetle) and the Necrophorus, those\r\nlively murderers; the gnat, the drinker of blood; the wasp, the\r\nirascible bully with the poisoned dagger; and the ant, the maleficent\r\ncreature which in the villages of the South of France saps and imperils\r\nthe rafters and ceilings of a dwelling with the same energy it brings to\r\nthe eating of a fig. I need say no more; human history is full of\r\nsimilar examples of the useful misunderstood and undervalued and the\r\ncalamitous glorified.\r\n\r\nWhat with the ants and other exterminating forces, the massacre was so\r\ngreat that the colonies of Crickets in my orchard, so numerous at the\r\noutset, were so far decimated that I could not continue my observations,\r\nbut had to resort to the outside world for further information.\r\n\r\nIn August, among the detritus of decaying leaves, in little oases whose\r\nturf is not burned by the sun, I find the young Cricket has already\r\ngrown to a considerable size; he is all black, like the adult, without a\r\nvestige of the white cincture of the early days. He has no domicile. The\r\nshelter of a dead leaf, the cover afforded by a flat stone is\r\nsufficient; he is a nomad, and careless where he takes his repose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. THE FIELD-CRICKET. A DUEL BETWEEN RIVALS.\r\n\r\n2. THE FIELD-CRICKET. THE DEFEATED RIVAL RETIRES, INSULTED BY THE\r\nVICTOR.]\r\n\r\nNot until the end of October, when the first frosts are at hand, does\r\nthe work of burrowing commence. The operation is very simple, as far as\r\nI can tell from what I have learned from the insect in captivity. The\r\nburrow is never made at a bare or conspicuous point; it is always\r\ncommenced under the shelter of a faded leaf of lettuce, the remains of\r\nthe food provided. This takes the place of the curtain of grass so\r\nnecessary to preserve the mysterious privacy of the establishment.\r\n\r\nThe little miner scratches with his fore-claws, but also makes use of\r\nthe pincers of his mandibles in order to remove pieces of grit or gravel\r\nof any size. I see him stamping with his powerful hinder limbs, which\r\nare provided with a double row of spines; I see him raking and sweeping\r\nbackwards the excavated material, and spreading it out in an inclined\r\nplane. This is his whole method.\r\n\r\nAt first the work goes forward merrily. The excavator disappears under\r\nthe easily excavated soil of his prison after two hours' labour. At\r\nintervals he returns to the orifice, always tail first, and always\r\nraking and sweeping. If fatigue overcomes him he rests on the threshold\r\nof his burrow, his head projecting outwards, his antennæ gently\r\nvibrating. Presently he re-enters his tunnel and sets to work again with\r\nhis pincers and rakes. Presently his periods of repose grow longer and\r\ntire my patience.\r\n\r\nThe most important part of the work is now completed. Once the burrow\r\nhas attained a depth of a couple of inches, it forms a sufficient\r\nshelter for the needs of the moment. The rest will be the work of time;\r\na labour resumed at will, for a short time daily. The burrow will be\r\nmade deeper and wider as the growth of the inmate and the inclemency of\r\nthe season demand. Even in winter, if the weather is mild, and the sun\r\nsmiles upon the threshold of his dwelling, one may sometimes surprise\r\nthe Cricket thrusting out small quantities of loosened earth, a sign of\r\nenlargement and of further burrowing. In the midst of the joys of spring\r\nthe cares of the house still continue; it is constantly restored and\r\nperfected until the death of the occupant.\r\n\r\nApril comes to an end, and the song of the Cricket commences. At first\r\nwe hear only timid and occasional solos; but very soon there is a\r\ngeneral symphony, when every scrap of turf has its performer. I am\r\ninclined to place the Cricket at the head of the choristers of spring.\r\nIn the waste lands of Provence, when the thyme and the lavender are in\r\nflower, the Cricket mingles his note with that of the crested lark,\r\nwhich ascends like a lyrical firework, its throat swelling with music,\r\nto its invisible station in the clouds, whence it pours its liquid arias\r\nupon the plain below. From the ground the chorus of the Crickets\r\nreplies. It is monotonous and artless, yet how well it harmonises, in\r\nits very simplicity, with the rustic gaiety of a world renewed! It is\r\nthe hosanna of the awakening, the alleluia of the germinating seed and\r\nthe sprouting blade. To which of the two performers should the palm be\r\ngiven? I should award it to the Cricket; he triumphs by force of numbers\r\nand his never-ceasing note. The lark hushes her song, that the blue-grey\r\nfields of lavender, swinging their aromatic censers before the sun, may\r\nhear the Cricket alone at his humble, solemn celebration.\r\n\r\nBut here the anatomist intervenes, roughly demanding of the Cricket:\r\n\"Show me your instrument, the source of your music!\" Like all things of\r\nreal value, it is very simple; it is based on the same principle as that\r\nof the locusts; there is the toothed fiddlestick and the vibrating\r\ntympanum.\r\n\r\nThe right wing-cover overlaps the left and almost completely covers it,\r\nexcept for the sudden fold which encases the insect's flank. This\r\narrangement is the reverse of that exhibited by the green grasshopper,\r\nthe Decticus, the Ephippigera, and their relations. The Cricket is\r\nright-handed, the others left-handed. The two wing-covers have the same\r\nstructure. To know one is to know the other. Let us examine that on the\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\nIt is almost flat on the back, but suddenly folds over at the side, the\r\nturn being almost at right angles. This lateral fold encloses the flank\r\nof the abdomen and is covered with fine oblique and parallel nervures.\r\nThe powerful nervures of the dorsal portion of the wing-cover are of the\r\ndeepest black, and their general effect is that of a complicated design,\r\nnot unlike a tangle of Arabic caligraphy.\r\n\r\nSeen by transmitted light the wing-cover is of a very pale reddish\r\ncolour, excepting two large adjacent spaces, one of which, the larger\r\nand anterior, is triangular in shape, while the other, the smaller and\r\nposterior, is oval. Each space is surrounded by a strong nervure and\r\ngoffered by slight wrinkles or depressions. These two spaces represent\r\nthe mirror of the locust tribe; they constitute the sonorous area. The\r\nsubstance of the wing-cover is finer here than elsewhere, and shows\r\ntraces of iridescent though somewhat smoky colour.\r\n\r\nThese are parts of an admirable instrument, greatly superior to that of\r\nthe Decticus. The five hundred prisms of the bow biting upon the ridges\r\nof the wing-cover opposed to it set all four tympanums vibrating at\r\nonce; the lower pair by direct friction, the upper pair by the vibration\r\nof the wing-cover itself. What a powerful sound results! The Decticus,\r\nendowed with only one indifferent \"mirror,\" can be heard only at a few\r\npaces; the Cricket, the possessor of four vibratory areas, can be heard\r\nat a hundred yards.\r\n\r\nThe Cricket rivals the Cigale in loudness, but his note has not the\r\ndispleasing, raucous quality of the latter. Better still: he has the\r\ngift of expression, for he can sing loud or soft. The wing-covers, as we\r\nhave seen, are prolonged in a deep fold over each flank. These folds are\r\nthe dampers, which, as they are pressed downwards or slightly raised,\r\nmodify the intensity of the sound, and according to the extent of their\r\ncontact with the soft abdomen now muffle the song to a _mezza voce_ and\r\nnow let it sound _fortissimo_.\r\n\r\nPeace reigns in the cage until the warlike instinct of the mating period\r\nbreaks out. These duels between rivals are frequent and lively, but not\r\nvery serious. The two rivals rise up against one another, biting at one\r\nanother's heads--these solid, fang-proof helmets--roll each other over,\r\npick themselves up, and separate. The vanquished Cricket scuttles off as\r\nfast as he can; the victor insults him by a couple of triumphant and\r\nboastful chirps; then, moderating his tone, he tacks and veers about the\r\ndesired one.\r\n\r\nThe lover proceeds to make himself smart. Hooking one of his antennæ\r\ntowards him with one of his free claws, he takes it between his\r\nmandibles in order to curl it and moisten it with saliva. With his long\r\nhind legs, spurred and laced with red, he stamps with impatience and\r\nkicks out at nothing. Emotion renders him silent. His wing-covers are\r\nnevertheless in rapid motion, but are no longer sounding, or at most\r\nemit but an unrhythmical rubbing sound.\r\n\r\nPresumptuous declaration! The female Cricket does not run to hide\r\nherself in the folds of her lettuce leaves; but she lifts the curtain a\r\nlittle, and looks out, and wishes to be seen:--\r\n\r\n  _Et fugit ad salices, et se cupit ante videri._\r\n\r\nShe flies towards the brake, but hopes first to be perceived, said the\r\npoet of the delightful eclogue, two thousand years ago. Sacred\r\nprovocations of lovers, are they not in all ages the same?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE ITALIAN CRICKET\r\n\r\n\r\nMy house shelters no specimens of the domestic Cricket, the guest of\r\nbakeries and rustic hearths. But although in my village the chinks under\r\nthe hearthstones are mute, the nights of summer are musical with a\r\nsinger little known in the North. The sunny hours of spring have their\r\nsinger, the Field-Cricket of which I have written; while in the summer,\r\nduring the stillness of the night, we hear the note of the Italian\r\nCricket, the _OEcanthus pellucens_, Scop. One diurnal and one\r\nnocturnal, between them they share the kindly half of the year. When the\r\nField-Cricket ceases to sing it is not long before the other begins its\r\nserenade.\r\n\r\nThe Italian Cricket has not the black costume and heavy shape\r\ncharacteristic of the family. It is, on the contrary, a slender, weakly\r\ncreature; its colour very pale, indeed almost white, as is natural in\r\nview of its nocturnal habits. In handling it one is afraid of crushing\r\nit between the fingers. It lives an aerial existence; on shrubs and\r\nbushes of all kinds, on tall herbage and grasses, and rarely descends to\r\nthe earth. Its song, the pleasant voice of the calm, hot evenings from\r\nJuly to October, commences at sunset and continues for the greater part\r\nof the night.\r\n\r\nThis song is familiar to all Provençals; for the least patch of thicket\r\nor tuft of grasses has its group of instrumentalists. It resounds even\r\nin the granaries, into which the insect strays, attracted thither by the\r\nfodder. But no one, so mysterious are the manners of the pallid Cricket,\r\nknows exactly what is the source of the serenade, which is often, though\r\nquite erroneously, attributed to the common field-cricket, which at this\r\nperiod is silent and as yet quite young.\r\n\r\nThe song consists of a _Gri-i-i, Gri-i-i_, a slow, gentle note, rendered\r\nmore expressive by a slight tremor. Hearing it, one divines the extreme\r\ntenuity and the amplitude of the vibrating membranes. If the insect is\r\nnot in any way disturbed as it sits in the low foliage, the note does\r\nnot vary, but at the least noise the performer becomes a ventriloquist.\r\nFirst of all you hear it there, close by, in front of you, and the next\r\nmoment you hear it over there, twenty yards away; the double note\r\ndecreased in volume by the distance.\r\n\r\nYou go forward. Nothing is there. The sound proceeds again from its\r\noriginal point. But no--it is not there; it is to the left now--unless\r\nit is to the right--or behind.... Complete confusion! It is impossible\r\nto detect, by means of the ear, the direction from which the chirp\r\nreally comes. Much patience and many precautions will be required before\r\nyou can capture the insect by the light of the lantern. A few specimens\r\ncaught under these conditions and placed in a cage have taught me the\r\nlittle I know concerning the musician who so perfectly deceives our\r\nears.\r\n\r\nThe wing-covers are both formed of a dry, broad membrane, diaphanous and\r\nas fine as the white skin on the outside of an onion, which is capable\r\nof vibrating over its whole area. Their shape is that of the segment of\r\na circle, cut away at the upper end. This segment is bent at a right\r\nangle along a strong longitudinal nervure, and descends on the outer\r\nside in a flap which encloses the insect's flank when in the attitude of\r\nrepose.\r\n\r\nThe right wing-cover overlaps the left. Its inner edge carries, on the\r\nunder side, near the base, a callosity from which five radiating\r\nnervures proceed; two of them upwards and two downwards, while the fifth\r\nruns approximately at right angles to these. This last nervure, which is\r\nof a slightly reddish hue, is the fundamental element of the musical\r\ndevice; it is, in short, the bow, the fiddlestick, as is proved by the\r\nfine notches which run across it. The rest of the wing-cover shows a few\r\nmore nervures of less importance, which hold the membrane stretched\r\ntight, but do not form part of the friction apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe left or lower wing-cover is of similar structure, with the\r\ndifference that the bow, the callosity, and the nervures occupy the\r\nupper face. It will be found that the two bows--that is, the toothed or\r\nindented nervures--cross one another obliquely.\r\n\r\nWhen the note has its full volume, the wing-covers are well raised above\r\nthe body like a wide gauzy sail, only touching along the internal edges.\r\nThe two bows, the toothed nervures, engage obliquely one with the other,\r\nand their mutual friction causes the sonorous vibration of the two\r\nstretched membranes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ITALIAN CRICKET.]\r\n\r\nThe sound can be modified accordingly as the strokes of each bow bear\r\nupon the callosity, which is itself serrated or wrinkled, or on one of\r\nthe four smooth radiating nervures. Thus in part are explained the\r\nillusions produced by a sound which seems to come first from one point,\r\nthen from another, when the timid insect is alarmed.\r\n\r\nThe production of loud or soft resounding or muffled notes, which gives\r\nthe illusion of distance, the principal element in the art of the\r\nventriloquist, has another and easily discovered source. To produce the\r\nloud, open sounds the wing-covers are fully lifted; to produce the\r\nmuted, muffled notes they are lowered. When lowered their outer edges\r\npress more or less lightly on the soft flanks of the insect, thus\r\ndiminishing the vibratory area and damping the sound.\r\n\r\nThe gentle touch of a finger-tip muffles the sharp, loud ringing of a\r\nglass tumbler or \"musical-glass\" and changes it into a veiled,\r\nindefinite sound which seems to come from a distance. The White Cricket\r\nknows this secret of acoustics. It misleads those that seek it by\r\npressing the edge of its vibrating membranes to the soft flesh of its\r\nabdomen. Our musical instruments have their dampers; that of the\r\n_OEcanthus pellucens_ rivals and surpasses them in simplicity of means\r\nand perfection of results.\r\n\r\nThe Field-Cricket and its relatives also vary the volume of their song\r\nby raising or lowering the elytra so as to enclose the abdomen in a\r\nvarying degree, but none of them can obtain by this method results so\r\ndeceptive as those produced by the Italian Cricket.\r\n\r\nTo this illusion of distance, which is a source of perpetually renewed\r\nsurprise, evoked by the slightest sound of our footsteps, we must add\r\nthe purity of the sound, and its soft tremolo. I know of no insect voice\r\nmore gracious, more limpid, in the profound peace of the nights of\r\nAugust. How many times, _per amica silentia lunæ_, have I lain upon the\r\nground, in the shelter of a clump of rosemary, to listen to the\r\ndelicious concert!\r\n\r\nThe nocturnal Cricket sings continually in the gardens. Each tuft of the\r\nred-flowered cistus has its band of musicians, and each bush of fragrant\r\nlavender. The shrubs and the terebinth-trees contain their orchestras.\r\nWith its clear, sweet voice, all this tiny world is questioning,\r\nreplying, from bush to bush, from tree to tree; or rather, indifferent\r\nto the songs of others, each little being is singing his joys to himself\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nAbove my head the constellation of Cygnus stretches its great cross\r\nalong the Milky Way; below, all around me, palpitates the insect\r\nsymphony. The atom telling of its joys makes me forget the spectacle of\r\nthe stars. We know nothing of these celestial eyes which gaze upon us,\r\ncold and calm, with scintillations like the blinking of eyelids.\r\n\r\nScience tells us of their distance, their speeds, their masses, their\r\nvolumes; it burdens us with stupendous numbers and stupefies us with\r\nimmensities; but it does not succeed in moving us. And why? Because it\r\nlacks the great secret: the secret of life. What is there, up there?\r\nWhat do these suns warm? Worlds analogous to ours, says reason; planets\r\non which life is evolving in an endless variety of forms. A superb\r\nconception of the universe, but after all a pure conception, not based\r\nupon patent facts and infallible testimony at the disposal of one and\r\nall. The probable, even the extremely probable, is not the obvious, the\r\nevident, which forces itself irresistibly and leaves no room for doubt.\r\n\r\nBut in your company, O my Crickets, I feel the thrill of life, the soul\r\nof our native lump of earth; and for this reason, as I lean against the\r\nhedge of rosemary, I bestow only an absent glance upon the constellation\r\nof Cygnus, but give all my attention to your serenade. A little animated\r\nslime, capable of pleasure and pain, surpasses in interest the universe\r\nof dead matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE SISYPHUS BEETLE.--THE INSTINCT OF PATERNITY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duties of paternity are seldom imposed on any but the higher\r\nanimals. They are most notable in the bird; and the furry peoples acquit\r\nthemselves honourably. Lower in the scale we find in the father a\r\ngeneral indifference as to the fate of the family. Very few insects form\r\nexceptions to this rule. Although all are imbued with a mating instinct\r\nthat is almost frenzied, nearly all, when the passion of the moment is\r\nappeased, terminate then and there their domestic relations, and\r\nwithdraw, indifferent to the brood, which has to look after itself as\r\nbest it may.\r\n\r\nThis paternal coldness, which would be odious in the higher walks of\r\nanimal life, where the weakness of the young demands prolonged\r\nassistance, has in the insect world the excuse that the new-born young\r\nare comparatively robust, and are able, without help, to fill their\r\nmouths and stomachs, provided they find themselves in propitious\r\nsurroundings. All that the prosperity of the race demands of the\r\nPierides, or Cabbage Butterflies, is that they should deposit their eggs\r\non the leaves of the cabbage; what purpose would be served by the\r\ninstincts of a father? The botanical instinct of the mother needs no\r\nassistance. At the period of laying the father would be in the way. Let\r\nhim pursue his flirtations elsewhere; the laying of eggs is a serious\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the majority of insects the process of education is\r\nunknown, or summary in the extreme. The insect has only to select a\r\ngrazing-ground upon which its family will establish itself the moment it\r\nis hatched; or a site which will allow the young to find their proper\r\nsustenance for themselves. There is no need of a father in these various\r\ncases. After mating, the discarded male, who is henceforth useless,\r\ndrags out a lingering existence of a few days, and finally perishes\r\nwithout having given the slightest assistance in the work of installing\r\nhis offspring.\r\n\r\nBut matters are not everywhere so primitive as this. There are tribes in\r\nwhich an inheritance is prepared for the family which will assure it\r\nboth of food and of shelter in advance. The Hymenoptera in particular\r\nare past-masters in the provision of cellars, jars, and other utensils\r\nin which the honey-paste destined for the young is stored; they are\r\nperfect in the art of excavating storehouses of food for their grubs.\r\n\r\nThis stupendous labour of construction and provisioning, this labour\r\nthat absorbs the insect's whole life, is the work of the mother only,\r\nwho wears herself out at her task. The father, intoxicated with\r\nsunlight, lies idle on the threshold of the workshop, watching the\r\nheroic female at her work, and regards himself as excused from all\r\nlabour when he has plagued his neighbours a little.\r\n\r\nDoes he never perform useful work? Why does he not follow the example\r\nof the swallows, each of whom brings a fair share of the straw and\r\nmortar for the building of the nest and the midges for the young brood?\r\nNo, he does nothing; perhaps alleging the excuse of his relative\r\nweakness. But this is a poor excuse; for to cut out little circles from\r\na leaf, to rake a little cotton from a downy plant, or to gather a\r\nlittle mortar from a muddy spot, would hardly be a task beyond his\r\npowers. He might very well collaborate, at least as labourer; he could\r\nat least gather together the materials for the more intelligent mother\r\nto place in position. The true motive of his idleness is ineptitude.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious thing that the Hymenoptera, the most skilful of all\r\nindustrial insects, know nothing of paternal labour. The male of the\r\ngenus, in whom we should expect the requirements of the young to develop\r\nthe highest aptitudes, is as useless as a butterfly, whose family costs\r\nso little to establish. The actual distribution of instinct upsets our\r\nmost reasonable previsions.\r\n\r\nIt upsets our expectations so completely that we are surprised to find\r\nin the dung-beetle the noble prerogative which is lacking in the bee\r\ntribe. The mates of several species of dung-beetle keep house together\r\nand know the worth of mutual labour. Consider the male and female\r\nGeotrupes, which prepare together the patrimony of their larvæ; in their\r\ncase the father assists his companion with the pressure of his robust\r\nbody in the manufacture of their balls of compressed nutriment. These\r\ndomestic habits are astonishing amidst the general isolation.\r\n\r\nTo this example, hitherto unique, my continual researches in this\r\ndirection permit me to-day to add three others which are fully as\r\ninteresting. All three are members of the corporation of dung-beetles. I\r\nwill relate their habits, but briefly, as in many respects their history\r\nis the same as that of the Sacred Scarabæus, the Spanish Copris, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe first example is the Sisyphus beetle (_Sisyphus Schæfferi_, Lin.),\r\nthe smallest and most industrious of our pill-makers. It has no equal in\r\nlively agility, grotesque somersaults, and sudden tumbles down the\r\nimpossible paths or over the impracticable obstacles to which its\r\nobstinacy is perpetually leading it. In allusion to these frantic\r\ngymnastics Latreille has given the insect the name of Sisyphus, after\r\nthe celebrated inmate of the classic Hades. This unhappy spirit\r\nunderwent terrible exertions in his efforts to heave to the top of a\r\nmountain an enormous rock, which always escaped him at the moment of\r\nattaining the summit, and rolled back to the foot of the slope. Begin\r\nagain, poor Sisyphus, begin again, begin again always! Your torments\r\nwill never cease until the rock is firmly placed upon the summit of the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nI like this myth. It is, in a way, the history of many of us; not odious\r\nscoundrels worthy of eternal torments, but worthy and laborious folk,\r\nuseful to their neighbours. One crime alone is theirs to expiate: the\r\ncrime of poverty. Half a century or more ago, for my own part, I left\r\nmany blood-stained tatters on the crags of the inhospitable mountain; I\r\nsweated, strained every nerve, exhausted my veins, spent without\r\nreckoning my reserves of energy, in order to carry upward and lodge in\r\na place of security that crushing burden, my daily bread; and hardly was\r\nthe load balanced but it once more slipped downwards, fell, and was\r\nengulfed. Begin again, poor Sisyphus; begin again, until your burden,\r\nfalling for the last time, shall crush your head and set you free at\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nThe Sisyphus of the naturalists knows nothing of these tribulations.\r\nAgile and lively, careless of slope or precipice, he trundles his load,\r\nwhich is sometimes food for himself, sometimes for his offspring. He is\r\nvery rare hereabouts; I should never have succeeded in obtaining a\r\nsufficient number of specimens for my purpose but for an assistant whom\r\nI may opportunely present to the reader, for he will be mentioned again\r\nin these recitals.\r\n\r\nThis is my son, little Paul, aged seven. An assiduous companion of the\r\nchase, he knows better than any one of his age the secrets of the\r\nCigale, the Cricket, and especially of the dung-beetle, his great\r\ndelight. At a distance of twenty yards his clear sight distinguishes the\r\nrefuse-tip of a beetle's burrow from a chance lump of earth; his fine\r\near will catch the chirping of a grasshopper inaudible to me. He lends\r\nme his sight and hearing, and I in return make him free of my thoughts,\r\nwhich he welcomes attentively, raising his wide blue eyes questioningly\r\nto mine.\r\n\r\nWhat an adorable thing is the first blossoming of the intellect! Best of\r\nall ages is that when the candid curiosity awakens and commences to\r\nacquire knowledge of every kind. Little Paul has his own insectorium, in\r\nwhich the Scarabæus makes his balls; his garden, the size of a\r\nhandkerchief, in which he grows haricot beans, which are often dug up to\r\nsee if the little roots are growing longer; his plantation, containing\r\nfour oak-trees an inch in height, to which the acorns still adhere.\r\nThese serve as diversions after the arid study of grammar, which goes\r\nforward none the worse on that account.\r\n\r\nWhat beautiful and useful knowledge the teaching of natural history\r\nmight put into childish heads, if only science would consider the very\r\nyoung; if our barracks of universities would only combine the lifeless\r\nstudy of books with the living study of the fields; if only the red tape\r\nof the curriculum, so dear to bureaucrats, would not strangle all\r\nwilling initiative. Little Paul and I will study as much as possible in\r\nthe open country, among the rosemary bushes and arbutus. There we shall\r\ngain vigour of body and of mind; we shall find the true and the\r\nbeautiful better than in school-books.\r\n\r\nTo-day the blackboard has a rest; it is a holiday. We rise early, in\r\nview of the intended expedition; so early that we must set out fasting.\r\nBut no matter; when we are hungry we shall rest in the shade, and you\r\nwill find in my knapsack the usual viaticum--apples and a crust of\r\nbread. The month of May is near; the Sisyphus should have appeared. Now\r\nwe must explore at the foot of the mountain, the scanty pastures through\r\nwhich the herds have passed; we must break with our fingers, one by one,\r\nthe cakes of sheep-dung dried by the sun, but still retaining a spot of\r\nmoisture in the centre. There we shall find Sisyphus, cowering and\r\nwaiting until the evening for fresher pasturage.\r\n\r\nPossessed of this secret, which I learned from previous fortuitous\r\ndiscoveries, little Paul immediately becomes a master in the art of\r\ndislodging the beetle. He shows such zeal, has such an instinct for\r\nlikely hiding-places, that after a brief search I am rich beyond my\r\nambitions. Behold me the owner of six couples of Sisyphus beetles: an\r\nunheard-of number, which I had never hoped to obtain.\r\n\r\nFor their maintenance a wire-gauze cover suffices, with a bed of sand\r\nand diet to their taste. They are very small, scarcely larger than a\r\ncherry-stone. Their shape is extremely curious. The body is dumpy,\r\ntapering to an acorn-shaped posterior; the legs are very long,\r\nresembling those of the spider when outspread; the hinder legs are\r\ndisproportionately long and curved, being thus excellently adapted to\r\nenlace and press the little pilule of dung.\r\n\r\nMating takes place towards the beginning of May, on the surface of the\r\nsoil, among the remains of the sheep-dung on which the beetles have been\r\nfeeding. Soon the moment for establishing the family arrives. With equal\r\nzeal the two partners take part in the kneading, transport, and baking\r\nof the food for their offspring. With the file-like forelegs a morsel of\r\nconvenient size is shaped from the piece of dung placed in the cage.\r\nFather and mother manipulate the piece together, striking it blows with\r\ntheir claws, compressing it, and shaping it into a ball about the size\r\nof a big pea.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the _Scarabæus sacer_, the exact spherical form is\r\nproduced without the mechanical device of rolling the ball. Before it is\r\nmoved, even before it is cut loose from its point of support, the\r\nfragment is modelled into the shape of a sphere. The beetle as geometer\r\nis aware of the form best adapted to the long preservation of preserved\r\nfoods.\r\n\r\nThe ball is soon ready. It must now be forced to acquire, by means of a\r\nvigorous rolling, the crust which will protect the interior from a too\r\nrapid evaporation. The mother, recognisable by her slightly robuster\r\nbody, takes the place of honour in front. Her long hinder legs on the\r\nsoil, her forelegs on the ball, she drags it towards her as she walks\r\nbackwards. The father pushes behind, moving tail first, his head held\r\nlow. This is exactly the method of the Scarabæus beetles, which also\r\nwork in couples, though for another object. The Sisyphus beetles harness\r\nthemselves to provide an inheritance for their larvæ; the larger insects\r\nare concerned in obtaining the material for a banquet which the two\r\nchance-met partners will consume underground.\r\n\r\nThe couple set off, with no definite goal ahead, across the\r\nirregularities of the soil, which cannot be avoided by a leader who\r\nhauls backwards. But even if the Sisyphus saw the obstacles she would\r\nnot try to evade them: witness her obstinate endeavour to drag her load\r\nup the wire gauze of her cage!\r\n\r\nA hopeless undertaking! Fixing her hinder claws in the meshes of the\r\nwire gauze the mother drags her burden towards her; then, enlacing it\r\nwith her legs, she holds it suspended. The father, finding no purchase\r\nfor his legs, clutches the ball, grows on to it, so to speak, thus\r\nadding his weight to that of the burden, and awaits events. The effort\r\nis too great to last. Ball and beetle fall together. The mother, from\r\nabove, gazes a moment in surprise, and suddenly lets herself fall, only\r\nto re-embrace the ball and recommence her impracticable efforts to scale\r\nthe wall. After many tumbles the attempt is at last abandoned.\r\n\r\nEven on level ground the task is not without its difficulties. At every\r\nmoment the load swerves on the summit of a pebble, a fragment of gravel;\r\nthe team are overturned, and lie on their backs, kicking their legs in\r\nthe air. This is a mere nothing. They pick themselves up and resume\r\ntheir positions, always quick and lively. The accidents which so often\r\nthrow them on their backs seem to cause them no concern; one would even\r\nthink they were invited. The pilule has to be matured, given a proper\r\nconsistency. In these conditions falls, shocks, blows, and jolts might\r\nwell enter into the programme. This mad trundling lasts for hours and\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nFinally, the mother, considering that the matter has been brought to a\r\nsatisfactory conclusion, departs in search of a favourable place for\r\nstorage. The father, crouched upon the treasure, waits. If the absence\r\nof his companion is prolonged he amuses himself by rapidly whirling the\r\npill between his hind legs, which are raised in the air. He juggles with\r\nthe precious burden; he tests its perfections between his curved legs,\r\ncalliper-wise. Seeing him frisking in this joyful occupation, who can\r\ndoubt that he experiences all the satisfactions of a father assured of\r\nthe future of his family? It is I, he seems to say, it is I who have\r\nmade this loaf, so beautifully round; it is I who have made the hard\r\ncrust to preserve the soft dough; it is I who have baked it for my sons!\r\nAnd he raises on high, in the sight of all, this magnificent testimonial\r\nof his labours.\r\n\r\nBut now the mother has chosen the site. A shallow pit is made, the mere\r\ncommencement of the projected burrow. The ball is pushed and pulled\r\nuntil it is close at hand. The father, a vigilant watchman, still\r\nretains his hold, while the mother digs with claws and head. Soon the\r\npit is deep enough to receive the ball; she cannot dispense with the\r\nclose contact of the sacred object; she must feel it bobbing behind her,\r\nagainst her back, safe from all parasites and robbers, before she can\r\ndecide to burrow further. She fears what might happen to the precious\r\nloaf if it were abandoned at the threshold of the burrow until the\r\ncompletion of the dwelling. There is no lack of midges and tiny\r\ndung-beetles--Aphodiinæ--which might take possession of it. It is only\r\nprudent to be distrustful.\r\n\r\nSo the ball is introduced into the pit, half in and half out of the\r\nmouth of the burrow. The mother, below, clasps and pulls; the father,\r\nabove, moderates the jolts and prevents it from rolling. All goes well.\r\nDigging is resumed, and the descent continues, always with the same\r\nprudence; one beetle dragging the load, the other regulating its descent\r\nand clearing away all rubbish that might hinder the operation. A few\r\nmore efforts, and the ball disappears underground with the two miners.\r\nWhat follows will be, for a time at least, only a repetition of what we\r\nhave seen. Let us wait half a day or so.\r\n\r\nIf our vigilance is not relaxed we shall see the father regain the\r\nsurface alone, and crouch in the sand near the mouth of the burrow.\r\nRetained by duties in the performance of which her companion can be of\r\nno assistance, the mother habitually delays her reappearance until the\r\nfollowing day. When she finally emerges the father wakes up, leaves his\r\nhiding place, and rejoins her. The reunited couple return to their\r\npasturage, refresh themselves, and then cut out another ball of dung.\r\nAs before, both share the work; the hewing and shaping, the transport,\r\nand the burial in ensilage.\r\n\r\nThis conjugal fidelity is delightful; but is it really the rule? I\r\nshould not dare to affirm that it is. There must be flighty individuals\r\nwho, in the confusion under a large cake of droppings, forget the fair\r\nconfectioners for whom they have worked as journeymen, and devote\r\nthemselves to the services of others, encountered by chance; there must\r\nbe temporary unions, and divorces after the burial of a single pellet.\r\nNo matter: the little I myself have seen gives me a high opinion of the\r\ndomestic morals of the Sisyphus.\r\n\r\nLet us consider these domestic habits a little further before coming to\r\nthe contents of the burrow. The father works fully as hard as the mother\r\nat the extraction and modelling of the pellet which is destined to be\r\nthe inheritance of a larva; he shares in the work of transport, even if\r\nhe plays a secondary part; he watches over the pellet when the mother is\r\nabsent, seeking for a suitable site for the excavation of the cellar; he\r\nhelps in the work of digging; he carries away the rubbish from the\r\nburrow; finally, to crown all these qualities, he is in a great measure\r\nfaithful to his spouse.\r\n\r\nThe Scarabæus exhibits some of these characteristics. He also assists\r\nhis spouse in the preparation of pellets of dung; he also assists her to\r\ntransport the pellets, the pair facing each other and the female going\r\nbackwards. But as I have stated already, the motive of this mutual\r\nservice is selfish; the two partners labour only for their own good. The\r\nfeast is for themselves alone. In the labours that concern the family\r\nthe female Scarabæus receives no assistance. Alone she moulds her\r\nsphere, extracts it from the lump and rolls it backwards, with her back\r\nto her task, in the position adopted by the male Sisyphus; alone she\r\nexcavates her burrow, and alone she buries the fruit of her labour.\r\nOblivious of the gravid mother and the future brood, the male gives her\r\nno assistance in her exhausting task. How different to the little\r\npellet-maker, the Sisyphus!\r\n\r\nIt is now time to visit the burrow. At no very great depth we find a\r\nnarrow chamber, just large enough for the mother to move around at her\r\nwork. Its very exiguity proves that the male cannot remain underground;\r\nso soon as the chamber is ready he must retire in order to leave the\r\nfemale room to move. We have, in fact, seen that he returns to the\r\nsurface long before the female.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the cellar consist of a single pellet, a masterpiece of\r\nplastic art. It is a miniature reproduction of the pear-shaped ball of\r\nthe Scarabæus, a reproduction whose very smallness gives an added value\r\nto the polish of the surface and the beauty of its curves. Its larger\r\ndiameter varies from half to three-quarters of an inch. It is the most\r\nelegant product of the dung-beetle's art.\r\n\r\nBut this perfection is of brief duration. Very soon the little \"pear\"\r\nbecomes covered with gnarled excrescences, black and twisted, which\r\ndisfigure it like so many warts. Part of the surface, which is otherwise\r\nintact, disappears under a shapeless mass. The origin of these knotted\r\nexcrescences completely deceived me at first. I suspected some\r\ncryptogamic vegetation, some _Spheriæcæa_, for example, recognisable by\r\nits black, knotted, incrusted growth. It was the larva that showed me my\r\nmistake.\r\n\r\nThe larva is a maggot curved like a hook, carrying on its back an ample\r\npouch or hunch, forming part of its alimentary canal. The reserve of\r\nexcreta in this hunch enables it to seal accidental perforations of the\r\nshell of its lodging with an instantaneous jet of mortar. These sudden\r\nemissions, like little worm-casts, are also practised by the Scarabæus,\r\nbut the latter rarely makes use of them.\r\n\r\nThe larvæ of the various dung-beetles utilise their alimentary residues\r\nin rough-casting their houses, which by their dimensions lend themselves\r\nto this method of disposal, while evading the necessity of opening\r\ntemporary windows by which the ordure can be expelled. Whether for lack\r\nof sufficient room, or for other reasons which escape me, the larva of\r\nthe Sisyphus, having employed a certain amount in the smoothing of the\r\ninterior, ejects the rest of its digestive products from its dwelling.\r\n\r\nLet us examine one of these \"pears\" when the inmate is already partly\r\ngrown. Sooner or later we shall see a spot of moisture appear at some\r\npoint on the surface; the wall softens, becomes thinner, and then,\r\nthrough the softened shell, a jet of dark green excreta rises and falls\r\nback upon itself in corkscrew convolutions. One excrescence the more has\r\nbeen formed; as it dries it becomes black.\r\n\r\nWhat has occurred? The larva has opened a temporary breach in the wall\r\nof its shell; and through this orifice, in which a slight thickness of\r\nthe outer glaze still remains, it has expelled the excess of mortar\r\nwhich it could not employ within. This practice of forming oubliettes in\r\nthe shell of its prison does not endanger the grub, as they are\r\nimmediately closed, and hermetically sealed by the base of the jet,\r\nwhich is compressed as by a stroke of a trowel. The stopper is so\r\nquickly put in place that the contents remain moist in spite of the\r\nfrequent breaches made in the shell of the \"pear.\" There is no danger of\r\nan influx of the dry outer air.\r\n\r\nThe Sisyphus seems to be aware of the peril which later on, in the\r\ndog-days, will threaten its \"pear,\" small as it is, and so near the\r\nsurface of the ground. It is extremely precocious. It labours in April\r\nand May when the air is mild. In the first fortnight of July, before the\r\nterrible dog-days have arrived, the members of its family break their\r\nshells and set forth in search of the heap of droppings which will\r\nfurnish them with food and lodging during the fierce days of summer.\r\nThen come the short but pleasant days of autumn, the retreat underground\r\nand the winter torpor, the awakening of spring, and finally the cycle is\r\nclosed by the festival of pellet-making.\r\n\r\nOne word more as to the fertility of the Sisyphus. My six couples under\r\nthe wire-gauze cover furnished me with fifty-seven inhabited pellets.\r\nThis gives an average of more than nine to each couple; a figure which\r\nthe _Scarabæus sacer_ is far from attaining. To what should we attribute\r\nthis superior fertility? I can only see one cause: the fact that the\r\nmale works as valiantly as the female. Family cares too great for the\r\nstrength of one are not too heavy when there are two to support them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nA BEE-HUNTER: THE _PHILANTHUS AVIPORUS_\r\n\r\n\r\nTo encounter among the Hymenoptera, those ardent lovers of flowers, a\r\nspecies which goes a-hunting on its own account is, to say the least of\r\nit, astonishing. That the larder of the larvæ should be provisioned with\r\ncaptured prey is natural enough; but that the provider, whose diet is\r\nhoney, should itself devour its captives is a fact both unexpected and\r\ndifficult to comprehend. We are surprised that a drinker of nectar\r\nshould become a drinker of blood. But our surprise abates if we consider\r\nthe matter closely. The double diet is more apparent than real; the\r\nstomach which fills itself with the nectar of flowers does not gorge\r\nitself with flesh. When she perforates the rump of her victim the\r\nOdynerus does not touch the flesh, which is a diet absolutely contrary\r\nto her tastes; she confines herself to drinking the defensive liquid\r\nwhich the grub distils at the end of its intestine. For her this liquid\r\nis doubtless a beverage of delicious flavour, with which she relieves\r\nfrom time to time her staple diet of the honey distilled by flowers,\r\nsome highly spiced condiment, appetiser or aperient, or perhaps--who\r\nknows?--a substitute for honey. Although the qualities of the liquid\r\nescape me, I see at least that Odynerus cares nothing for the rest.\r\nOnce the pouch is emptied the larva is abandoned as useless offal, a\r\ncertain sign of non-carnivorous appetites. Under these conditions the\r\npersecutor of Chrysomela can no longer be regarded as guilty of an\r\nunnatural double dietary.\r\n\r\nWe may even wonder whether other species also are not apt to draw some\r\ndirect profit from the hunting imposed upon them by the needs of the\r\nfamily. The procedure of Odynerus in opening the anal pouch is so far\r\nremoved from the usual that we should not anticipate many imitators; it\r\nis a secondary detail, and impracticable with game of a different kind.\r\nBut there may well be a certain amount of variety in the means of direct\r\nutilisation. Why, for example, when the victim which has just been\r\nparalysed or rendered insensible by stinging contains in the stomach a\r\ndelicious meal, semi-liquid or liquid in consistency, should the hunter\r\nscruple to rob the half-living body and force it to disgorge without\r\ninjuring the quality of its flesh? There may well be robbers of the\r\nmoribund, attracted not by their flesh but by the appetising contents of\r\ntheir stomachs.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact there are such, and they are numerous. In the first\r\nrank we may cite that hunter of the domestic bee, _Philanthus aviporus_\r\n(Latreille). For a long time I suspected Philanthus of committing such\r\nacts of brigandage for her own benefit, having many times surprised her\r\ngluttonously licking the honey-smeared mouth of the bee; I suspected\r\nthat her hunting of the bee was not undertaken entirely for the benefit\r\nof her larvæ. The suspicion was worth experimental confirmation. At the\r\ntime I was interested in another question also: I wanted to study,\r\nabsolutely at leisure, the methods by which the various predatory\r\nspecies dealt with their victims. In the case of Philanthus I made use\r\nof the improvised cage already described; and Philanthus it was who\r\nfurnished me with my first data on the subject. She responded to my\r\nhopes with such energy that I thought myself in possession of an\r\nunequalled method of observation, by means of which I could witness\r\nagain and again, to satiety even, incidents of a kind so difficult to\r\nsurprise in a state of nature. Alas! the early days of my acquaintance\r\nwith Philanthus promised me more than the future had in store for me!\r\nNot to anticipate, however, let us place under the bell-glass the hunter\r\nand the game. I recommend the experiment to whomsoever would witness the\r\nperfection with which the predatory Hymenoptera use their stings. The\r\nresult is not in doubt and the waiting is short; the moment the prey is\r\nperceived in an attitude favourable to her designs, the bandit rushes at\r\nit, and all is over. In detail, the tragedy develops as follows:\r\n\r\nI place under a bell-glass a Philanthus and two or three domestic bees.\r\nThe prisoners climb the glass walls, on the more strongly lighted side;\r\nthey ascend, descend, and seek to escape; the polished, vertical surface\r\nis for them quite easy to walk upon. They presently quiet down, and the\r\nbrigand begins to notice her surroundings. The antennæ point forward,\r\nseeking information; the hinder legs are drawn up with a slight\r\ntrembling, as of greed and rapacity, in the thighs; the head turns to\r\nthe right and the left, and follows the evolutions of the bees against\r\nthe glass. The posture of the scoundrelly insect is strikingly\r\nexpressive; one reads in it the brutal desires of a creature in ambush,\r\nthe cunning patience that postpones attack. The choice is made, and\r\nPhilanthus throws herself upon her victim.\r\n\r\nTurn by turn tumbled and tumbling, the two insects roll over and over.\r\nBut the struggle soon quiets down, and the assassin commences to plunder\r\nher prize. I have seen her adopt two methods. In the first, more usual\r\nthan the other, the bee is lying on the ground, upon its back, and\r\nPhilanthus, mouth to mouth and abdomen to abdomen, clasps it with her\r\nsix legs, while she seizes its neck in her mandibles. The abdomen is\r\nthen curved forward and gropes for a moment for the desired spot in the\r\nupper part of the thorax, which it finally reaches. The sting plunges\r\ninto the victim, remains in the wound for a moment, and all is over.\r\nWithout loosing the victim, which is still tightly clasped, the murderer\r\nrestores her abdomen to the normal position and holds it pressed against\r\nthat of the bee.\r\n\r\nBy the second method Philanthus operates standing upright. Resting on\r\nthe hinder feet and the extremity of the folded wings, she rises proudly\r\nto a vertical position, holding the bee facing her by her four anterior\r\nclaws. In order to get the bee into the proper position for the final\r\nstroke, she swings the poor creature round and back again with the\r\ncareless roughness of a child dandling a doll. Her pose is magnificent,\r\nsolidly based upon her sustaining tripod, the two posterior thighs and\r\nthe end of the wings, she flexes the abdomen forwards and upwards, and,\r\nas before, stings the bee in the upper part of the thorax. The\r\noriginality of her pose at the moment of striking surpasses anything I\r\nhave ever witnessed.\r\n\r\nThe love of knowledge in matters of natural history is not without its\r\ncruelties. To make absolutely certain of the point attained by the\r\nsting, and to inform myself completely concerning this horrible talent\r\nfor murder, I have provoked I dare not confess how many assassinations\r\nin captivity. Without a single exception, the bee has always been stung\r\nin the throat. In the preparations for the final blow the extremity of\r\nthe abdomen may of course touch here and there, at different points of\r\nthe thorax or abdomen, but it never remains there, nor is the sting\r\nunsheathed, as may easily be seen. Once the struggle has commenced the\r\nPhilanthus is so absorbed in her operations that I can remove the glass\r\ncover and follow every detail of the drama with my magnifying-glass.\r\n\r\nThe invariable situation of the wound being proved, I bend back the head\r\nof the bee, so as to open the articulation. I see under what we may call\r\nthe chin of the bee a white spot, hardly a twenty-fifth of an inch\r\nsquare, where the horny integuments are lacking, and the fine skin is\r\nexposed uncovered. It is there, always there, in that tiny defect in the\r\nbee's armour, that the sting is inserted. Why is this point attacked\r\nrather than another? Is it the only point that is vulnerable? Stretch\r\nopen the articulation of the corselet to the rear of the first pair of\r\nlegs. There you will see an area of defenceless skin, fully as delicate\r\nas that of the throat, but much more extensive. The horny armour of the\r\nbee has no larger breach. If the Philanthus were guided solely by\r\nconsiderations of vulnerability she would certainly strike there,\r\ninstead of insistently seeking the narrow breach in the throat. The\r\nsting would not grope or hesitate, it would find its mark at the first\r\nattempt. No; the poisoned thrust is not conditioned by mechanical\r\nconsiderations; the murderer disdains the wide breach in the corselet\r\nand prefers the lesser one beneath the chin, for purely logical reasons\r\nwhich we will now attempt to elicit.\r\n\r\nThe moment the bee is stung I release it from the aggressor. I am struck\r\nin the first place by the sudden inertia of the antennæ and the various\r\nmembers of the mouth; organs which continue to move for so long a time\r\nin the victims of most predatory creatures. I see none of the\r\nindications with which my previous studies of paralysed victims have\r\nmade me familiar: the antennæ slowly waving, the mandibles opening and\r\nclosing, the palpæ trembling for days, for weeks, even for months. The\r\nthighs tremble for a minute or two at most; and the struggle is over.\r\nHenceforth there is complete immobility. The significance of this sudden\r\ninertia is forced upon me: the Philanthus has stabbed the cervical\r\nganglions. Hence the sudden immobility of all the organs of the head:\r\nhence the real, not the apparent death of the bee. The Philanthus does\r\nnot paralyse merely, but kills.\r\n\r\nThis is one step gained. The murderer chooses the point below the chin\r\nas the point of attack, in order to reach the principal centres of\r\ninnervation, the cephalic ganglions, and thus to abolish life at a\r\nsingle blow. The vital centres being poisoned, immediate death must\r\nfollow. If the object of the Philanthus were merely to cause paralysis\r\nshe would plunge her sting into the defective corselet, as does the\r\nCerceris in attacking the weevil, whose armour is quite unlike the\r\nbee's. Her aim is to kill outright, as we shall presently see; she wants\r\na corpse, not a paralytic. We must admit that her technique is\r\nadmirable; our human murderers could do no better.\r\n\r\nHer posture of attack, which is very different to that of the\r\nparalysers, is infallibly fatal to the victim. Whether she delivers the\r\nattack in the erect position or prone, she holds the bee before her,\r\nhead to head and thorax to thorax. In this position it suffices to flex\r\nthe abdomen in order to reach the joint of the neck, and to plunge the\r\nsting obliquely upwards into the head of the captive. If the bee were\r\nseized in the inverse position, or if the sting were to go slightly\r\nastray, the results would be totally different; the sting, penetrating\r\nthe bee in a downward direction, would poison the first thoracic\r\nganglion and provoke a partial paralysis only. What art, to destroy a\r\nmiserable bee! In what fencing-school did the slayer learn that terrible\r\nupward thrust beneath the chin? And as she has learned it, how is it\r\nthat her victim, so learned in matters of architecture, so conversant\r\nwith the politics of Socialism, has so far learned nothing in her own\r\ndefence? As vigorous as the aggressor, she also carries a rapier, which\r\nis even more formidable and more painful in its results--at all events,\r\nwhen my finger is the victim! For centuries and centuries Philanthus has\r\nstored her cellars with the corpses of bees, yet the innocent victim\r\nsubmits, and the annual decimation of her race has not taught her how to\r\ndeliver herself from the scourge by a well-directed thrust. I am afraid\r\nI shall never succeed in understanding how it is that the assailant has\r\nacquired her genius for sudden murder while the assailed, better armed\r\nand no less powerful, uses her dagger at random, and so far without\r\neffect. If the one has learned something from the prolonged exercise of\r\nthe attack, then the other should also have learned something from the\r\nprolonged exercise of defence, for attack and defence are of equal\r\nsignificance in the struggle for life. Among the theorists of our day,\r\nis there any so far-sighted as to be able to solve this enigma?\r\n\r\nI will take this opportunity of presenting a second point which\r\nembarrasses me; it is the carelessness--it is worse than that--the\r\nimbecility of the bee in the presence of the Philanthus. One would\r\nnaturally suppose that the persecuted insect, gradually instructed by\r\nfamily misfortune, would exhibit anxiety at the approach of the\r\nravisher, and would at least try to escape. But in my bell-glasses or\r\nwire-gauze cages I see nothing of the kind. Once the first excitement\r\ndue to imprisonment has passed the bee takes next to no notice of its\r\nterrible neighbour. I have seen it side by side with Philanthus on the\r\nsame flower; assassin and future victim were drinking from the same\r\ngoblet. I have seen it stupidly coming to inquire what the stranger\r\nmight be, as the latter crouched watching on the floor. When the\r\nmurderer springs it is usually upon some bee which passes before her,\r\nand throws itself, so to speak, into her clutches; either thoughtlessly\r\nor out of curiosity. There is no frantic terror, no sign of anxiety, no\r\ntendency to escape. How is it that the experience of centuries, which is\r\nsaid to teach so much to the lower creatures, has not taught the bee\r\neven the beginning of apine wisdom: a deep-rooted horror of the\r\nPhilanthus? Does the bee count upon its sting? But the unhappy creature\r\nis no fencer; it thrusts without method, at random. Nevertheless, let us\r\nwatch it at the final and fatal moment.\r\n\r\nWhen the ravisher brings her sting into play the bee also uses its\r\nsting, and with fury. I see the point thrusting now in this direction,\r\nnow in that; but in empty air, or grazing and slipping over the\r\nconvexity of the murderer's back, which is violently flexed. These blows\r\nhave no serious results. In the position assumed by the two as they\r\nstruggle the abdomen of the Philanthus is inside and that of the bee\r\noutside; thus the sting of the latter has under its point only the\r\ndorsal face of the enemy, which is convex and slippery, and almost\r\ninvulnerable, so well is it armoured. There is no breach there by which\r\nthe sting might possibly enter; and the operation takes place with the\r\ncertainty of a skilful surgeon using the lancet, despite the indignant\r\nprotests of the patient.\r\n\r\nThe fatal stroke once delivered, the murderer remains for some time on\r\nthe body of the victim, clasping it face to face, for reasons that we\r\nmust now consider. It may be that the position is perilous for\r\nPhilanthus. The posture of attack and self-protection is abandoned, and\r\nthe ventral area, more vulnerable than the back, is exposed to the sting\r\nof the bee. Now the dead bee retains for some minutes the reflex use of\r\nthe sting, as I know to my cost: for removing the bee too soon from the\r\naggressor, and handling it carelessly, I have received a most effectual\r\nsting. In her long embrace of the poisoned bee, how does Philanthus\r\navoid this sting, which does not willingly give up its life without\r\nvengeance? Are there not sometimes unexpected accidents? Perhaps.\r\n\r\nHere is a fact which encourages me in this belief. I had placed under\r\nthe bell-glass at the same time four bees and as many Eristales, in\r\norder to judge of the entomological knowledge of Philanthus as\r\nexemplified in the distinction of species. Reciprocal quarrels broke out\r\namong the heterogeneous group. Suddenly, in the midst of the tumult,\r\nthe killer is killed. Who has struck the blow? Certainly not the\r\nturbulent but pacific Eristales; it was one of the bees, which by chance\r\nhad thrust truly in the mellay. When and how? I do not know. This\r\naccident is unique in my experience; but it throws a light upon the\r\nquestion. The bee is capable of withstanding its adversary; it can, with\r\na thrust of its envenomed needle, kill the would-be killer. That it does\r\nnot defend itself more skilfully when it falls into the hands of its\r\nenemy is due to ignorance of fencing, not to the weakness of the arm.\r\nAnd here again arises, more insistently than before, the question I\r\nasked but now: how is it that the Philanthus has learned for purposes of\r\nattack what the bee has not learned for purposes of defence. To this\r\ndifficulty I see only one reply: the one knows without having learned\r\nand the other does not know, being incapable of learning.\r\n\r\nLet us now examine the motives which induce the Philanthus to kill its\r\nbee instead of paralysing it. The murder once committed, it does not\r\nrelease its victim for a moment, but holding it tightly clasped with its\r\nsix legs pressed against its body, it commences to ravage the corpse. I\r\nsee it with the utmost brutality rooting with its mandibles in the\r\narticulation of the neck, and often also in the more ample articulation\r\nof the corselet, behind the first pair of legs; perfectly aware of the\r\nfine membrane in that part, although it does not take advantage of the\r\nfact when employing its sting, although this vulnerable point is the\r\nmore accessible of the two breaches in the bee's armour. I see it\r\nsqueezing the bee's stomach, compressing it with its own abdomen,\r\ncrushing it as in a vice. The brutality of this manipulation is\r\nstriking; it shows that there is no more need of care and skill. The\r\nbee is a corpse, and a little extra pushing and squeezing will not\r\ndeteriorate its quality as food, provided there is no effusion of blood;\r\nand however rough the treatment, I have never been able to discover the\r\nslightest wound.\r\n\r\nThese various manipulations, above all the compression of the throat,\r\nlead to the desired result: the honey in the stomach of the bee ascends\r\nto the mouth. I see the drops of honey welling out, lapped up by the\r\nglutton as soon as they appear. The bandit greedily takes in its mouth\r\nthe extended and sugared tongue of the dead insect; then once more it\r\npresses the neck and the thorax, and once more applies the pressure of\r\nits abdomen to the honey-sac of the bee. The honey oozes forth and is\r\ninstantly licked up. This odious meal at the expense of the corpse is\r\ntaken in a truly sybaritic attitude: the Philanthus lies upon its side\r\nwith the bee between its legs. This atrocious meal lasts often half an\r\nhour and longer. Finally the exhausted corpse is abandoned; regretfully,\r\nit seems, for from time to time I have seen the ogre return to the feast\r\nand repeat its manipulation of the body. After taking a turn round the\r\ntop of the bell-glass the robber of the dead returns to the victim,\r\nsqueezes it once more, and licks its mouth until the last trace of honey\r\nhas disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe frantic passion of the Philanthus for the honey of the bee is\r\nbetrayed in another fashion. When the first victim has been exhausted I\r\nhave introduced a second bee, which has been promptly stabbed under the\r\nchin and squeezed as before in order to extract its honey. A third has\r\nsuffered the same fate without appeasing the bandit. I have offered a\r\nfourth, a fifth; all are accepted. My notes record that a Philanthus\r\nsacrificed six bees in succession before my eyes, and emptied them all\r\nof honey in the approved manner. The killing came to an end not because\r\nthe glutton was satiated, but because my functions as provider were\r\nbecoming troublesome; the dry month of August leaves but few insects in\r\nthe flowerless garden. Six bees emptied of their honey--what a\r\ngluttonous meal! Yet the famishing creature would doubtless have\r\nwelcomed a copious addition thereto had I had the means of furnishing\r\nit!\r\n\r\nWe need not regret the failure of bees upon this occasion; for what I\r\nhave already written is sufficient testimony of the singular habits of\r\nthis murderer of bees. I am far from denying that the Philanthus has\r\nhonest methods of earning its living; I see it among the flowers, no\r\nless assiduous than the rest of the Hymenoptera, peacefully drinking\r\nfrom their cups of nectar. The male, indeed, being stingless, knows no\r\nother means of supporting himself. The mothers, without neglecting the\r\nflowers as a general thing, live by brigandage as well. It is said of\r\nthe Labba, that pirate of the seas, that it pounces upon sea-birds as\r\nthey rise from the waves with captured fish in their beaks. With a blow\r\nof the beak delivered in the hollow of the stomach, the aggressor forces\r\nthe victim to drop its prey, and promptly catches it as it falls. The\r\nvictim at least escapes with nothing worse than a blow at the base of\r\nthe neck. The Philanthus, less scrupulous, falls upon the bee, stabs it\r\nto death and makes it disgorge in order to nourish herself upon its\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\nNourish, I say, and I do not withdraw the expression. To support my\r\nstatement I have better reasons than those already presented. In the\r\ncages in which various predatory Hymenoptera whose warlike habits I am\r\nstudying are confined, waiting until I have procured the desired\r\nprey--not always an easy proceeding--I have planted a few heads of\r\nflowers and a couple of thistle-heads sprinkled with drops of honey,\r\nrenewed at need. On these my captives feed. In the case of the\r\nPhilanthus the honeyed flowers, although welcomed, are not\r\nindispensable. It is enough if from time to time I place in the cage a\r\nfew living bees. Half a dozen a day is about the proper allowance. With\r\nno other diet than the honey extracted from their victims I keep my\r\nspecimens of Philanthus for a fortnight and three weeks.\r\n\r\nSo much is plain: in a state of freedom, when occasion offers, the\r\nPhilanthus must kill on her own account as she does in captivity. The\r\nOdynerus asks nothing of the Chrysomela but a simple condiment, the\r\naromatic juice of the anal pouch; the Philanthus demands a full diet, or\r\nat least a notable supplement thereto, in the form of the contents of\r\nthe stomach. What a hecatomb of bees must not a colony of these pirates\r\nsacrifice for their personal consumption, to say nothing of their stores\r\nof provisions! I recommend the Philanthus to the vengeance of apiarists.\r\n\r\nFor the moment we will not look further into the original causes of the\r\ncrime. Let us consider matters as we know them, with all their real or\r\napparent atrocity. In order to nourish herself the Philanthus levies\r\ntribute upon the crop of the bee. This being granted, let us consider\r\nthe method of the aggressor more closely. She does not paralyse its\r\ncaptives according to the customary rites of the predatory insects; she\r\nkills them. Why? To the eyes of understanding the necessity of a sudden\r\ndeath is as clear as day. Without eviscerating the bee, which would\r\nresult in the deterioration of its flesh considered as food for the\r\nlarvæ; without having recourse to the bloody extirpation of the stomach,\r\nthe Philanthus intends to obtain its honey. By skilful manipulation, by\r\ncunning massage, she must somehow make the bee disgorge. Suppose the bee\r\nstung in the rear of the corselet and paralysed. It is deprived of\r\nlocomotion, but not of vitality. The digestive apparatus, in particular,\r\nretains in full, or at least in part, its normal energies, as is proved\r\nby the frequent dejections of paralysed victims so long as the intestine\r\nis not emptied; a fact notably exemplified by the victims of the Sphex\r\nfamily; helpless creatures which I have before now kept alive for forty\r\ndays with the aid of a little sugared water. Well! without therapeutic\r\nmeans, without emetics or stomach-pumps, how is a stomach intact and in\r\ngood order to be persuaded to yield up its contents? That of the bee,\r\njealous of its treasure, will lend itself to such treatment less readily\r\nthan another. Paralysed, the creature is inert; but there are always\r\ninternal energies and organic resistances which will not yield to the\r\npressure of the manipulator. In vain would the Philanthus gnaw at the\r\nthroat and squeeze the flanks; the honey would not return to the mouth\r\nas long as a trace of life kept the stomach closed.\r\n\r\nMatters are different with a corpse. The springs relax; the muscles\r\nyield; the resistance of the stomach ceases, and the vessels containing\r\nthe honey are emptied by the pressure of the thief. We see, therefore,\r\nthat the Philanthus is obliged to inflict a sudden death which\r\ninstantly destroys the contractile power of the organs. Where shall the\r\ndeadly blow be delivered? The slayer knows better than we, when she\r\npierces the victim beneath the chin. Through the narrow breach in the\r\nthroat the cerebral ganglions are reached and immediate death ensues.\r\n\r\nThe examination of these acts of brigandage is not sufficient in view of\r\nmy incorrigible habit of following every reply by another query, until\r\nthe granite wall of the unknowable rises before me. Although the\r\nPhilanthus is skilled in forcing the bee to disgorge, in emptying the\r\ncrop distended with honey, this diabolical skill cannot be merely an\r\nalimentary resource, above all when in common with other insects she has\r\naccess to the refectory of the flowers. I cannot regard her talents as\r\ninspired solely by the desire of a meal obtained by the labour of\r\nemptying the stomach of another insect. Something must surely escape us\r\nhere: the real reason for emptying the stomach. Perhaps a respectable\r\nreason is concealed by the horrors I have recorded. What is it?\r\n\r\nEvery one will understand the vagueness which fills the observer's mind\r\nin respect of such a question as this. The reader has the right to be\r\ndoubtful. I will spare him my suspicions, my gropings for the truth, and\r\nthe checks encountered in the search, and give him the results of my\r\nlong inquiry. Everything has its appropriate and harmonious reason. I am\r\ntoo fully persuaded of this to believe that the Philanthus commits her\r\nprofanation of corpses merely to satisfy her appetite. What does the\r\nempty stomach mean? May it not--Yes!--But, after all, who knows? Well,\r\nlet us follow up the scent.\r\n\r\nThe first care of the mothers is the welfare of the family. So far all\r\nwe know of the Philanthus concerns her talent for murder. Let us\r\nconsider her as a mother. We have seen her hunt on her own account; let\r\nus now watch her hunt for her offspring, for the race. Nothing is\r\nsimpler than to distinguish between the two kinds of hunting. When the\r\ninsect wants a few good mouthfuls of honey and nothing else, she\r\nabandons the bee contemptuously when she has emptied its stomach. It is\r\nso much valueless waste, which will shrivel where it lies and be\r\ndissected by ants. If, on the other hand, she intends to place it in the\r\nlarder as a provision for her larvæ, she clasps it with her two\r\nintermediate legs, and, walking on the other four, drags it to and fro\r\nalong the edge of the bell-glass in search of an exit so that she may\r\nfly off with her prey. Having recognised the circular wall as\r\nimpassable, she climbs its sides, now holding the bee in her mandibles\r\nby the antennæ, clinging as she climbs to the vertical polished surface\r\nwith all six feet. She gains the summit of the glass, stays for a little\r\nwhile in the flask-like cavity of the terminal button or handle, returns\r\nto the ground, and resumes her circuit of the glass and her climbing,\r\nrelinquishing the bee only after an obstinate attempt to escape with it.\r\nThe persistence with which the Philanthus retains her clasp upon the\r\nencumbering burden shows plainly that the game would go straight to the\r\nlarder were the insect at liberty.\r\n\r\nThose bees intended for the larvæ are stung under the chin like the\r\nothers; they are true corpses; they are manipulated, squeezed, exhausted\r\nof their honey, just as the others. There is no difference in the method\r\nof capture nor in their after-treatment.\r\n\r\nAs captivity might possibly result in a few anomalies of action, I\r\ndecided to inquire how matters went forward in the open. In the\r\nneighbourhood of some colonies of Philanthidæ I lay in wait, watching\r\nfor perhaps a longer time than the question justified, as it was already\r\nsettled by what occurred in captivity. My scrupulous watching at various\r\ntimes was rewarded. The majority of the hunters immediately entered\r\ntheir nests, carrying the bees pressed against their bodies; some halted\r\non the neighbouring undergrowth; and these I saw treating the bee in the\r\nusual manner, and lapping the honey from its mouth. After these\r\npreparations the corpse was placed in the larder. All doubt was thus\r\ndestroyed: the bees provided for the larvæ are previously carefully\r\nemptied of their honey.\r\n\r\nSince we are dealing with the subject, let us take the opportunity of\r\ninquiring into the customs of the Philanthus in a state of freedom.\r\nMaking use of her victims when absolutely lifeless, so that they would\r\nputrefy in the course of a few days, this hunter of bees cannot adopt\r\nthe customs of certain insects which paralyse their prey, and fill their\r\ncellars before laying an egg. She must surely be obliged to follow the\r\nmethod of the Bembex, whose larva receives, at intervals, the necessary\r\nnourishment; the amount increasing as the larva grows. The facts confirm\r\nthis deduction. I spoke just now of the tediousness of my watching when\r\nwatching the colonies of the Philanthus. It was perhaps even more\r\ntedious than when I was keeping an eye upon the Bembex. Before the\r\nburrows of _Cerceris tuberculus_ and other devourers of the weevil, and\r\nbefore that of the yellow-winged Sphex, the slayer of crickets, there\r\nis plenty of distraction, owing to the busy movements of the community.\r\nThe mothers have scarcely entered the nest before they are off again,\r\nreturning quickly with fresh prey, only to set out once more. The going\r\nand coming is almost continuous until the storehouse is full.\r\n\r\nThe burrows of the Philanthus know nothing of such animation, even in a\r\npopulous colony. In vain my vigils prolonged themselves into whole\r\nmornings or afternoons, and only very rarely does the mother who has\r\nentered with a bee set forth upon a second expedition. Two captures by\r\nthe same huntress is the most that I have seen in my long watches. Once\r\nthe family is provided with sufficient food for the moment the mother\r\npostpones further hunting trips until hunting becomes necessary, and\r\nbusies herself with digging and burrowing in her underground dwelling.\r\nLittle cells are excavated, and I see the rubbish from them gradually\r\npushed up to the surface. With that exception there is no sign of\r\nactivity; it is as though the burrow were deserted.\r\n\r\nTo lay the nest bare is not easy. The burrow penetrates to a depth of\r\nabout three feet in a compact soil; sometimes in a vertical, sometimes\r\nin a horizontal direction. The spade and pick, wielded by hands more\r\nvigorous but less expert than my own, are indispensable; but the conduct\r\nof the excavation is anything but satisfactory. At the extremity of the\r\nlong gallery--it seems as though the straw I use for sounding would\r\nnever reach the end--we finally discover the cells, egg-shaped cavities\r\nwith the longer axis horizontal. Their number and their mutual\r\ndisposition escape me.\r\n\r\nSome already contain the cocoon--slender and translucid, like that of\r\nthe Cerceris, and, like it, recalling the shape of certain\r\nhomoeopathic phials, with oval bodies surmounted by a tapering neck.\r\nBy the extremity of the neck, which is blackened and hardened by the\r\ndejecta of the larvæ, the cocoon is fixed to the end of the cell without\r\nany other support. It reminds one of a short club, planted by the end of\r\nthe handle, in a line with the horizontal axis of the cell. Other cells\r\ncontain the larva in a stage more or less advanced. The grub is eating\r\nthe last victim proffered; around it lie the remains of food already\r\nconsumed. Others, again, show me a bee, a single bee, still intact, and\r\nhaving an egg deposited on the under-side of the thorax. This bee\r\nrepresents the first instalment of rations; others will follow as the\r\ngrub matures. My expectations are thus confirmed; as with Bembex, slayer\r\nof Diptera, so Philanthus, killer of bees, lays her egg upon the first\r\nbody stored, and completes, at intervals, the provisioning of the cells.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the dead bee is elucidated; there remains the other\r\nproblem, of incomparable interest--Why, before they are given over to\r\nthe larvæ, are the bees robbed of their honey? I have said, and I\r\nrepeat, that the killing and emptying of the bee cannot be explained\r\nsolely by the gluttony of the Philanthus. To rob the worker of its booty\r\nis nothing; such things are seen every day; but to slaughter it in order\r\nto empty its stomach--no, gluttony cannot be the only motive. And as the\r\nbees placed in the cells are squeezed dry no less than the others, the\r\nidea occurs to me that as a beefsteak garnished with _confitures_ is not\r\nto every one's taste, so the bee sweetened with honey may well be\r\ndistasteful or even harmful to the larvæ of the Philanthus. What would\r\nthe grub do if, replete with blood and flesh, it were to find under its\r\nmandibles the honey-bag of the bee?--if, gnawing at random, it were to\r\nopen the bees stomach and so drench its game with syrup? Would it\r\napprove of the mixture? Would the little ogre pass without repugnance\r\nfrom the gamey flavour of a corpse to the scent of flowers? To affirm or\r\ndeny is useless. We must see. Let us see.\r\n\r\nI take the young larvæ of the Philanthus, already well matured, but\r\ninstead of serving them with the provisions buried in their cells I\r\noffer them game of my own catching--bees that have filled themselves\r\nwith nectar among the rosemary bushes. My bees, killed by crushing the\r\nhead, are thankfully accepted, and at first I see nothing to justify my\r\nsuspicions. Then my nurslings languish, show themselves disdainful of\r\ntheir food, give a negligent bite here and there, and finally, one and\r\nall, die beside their uncompleted meal. All my attempts miscarry; not\r\nonce do I succeed in rearing my larvæ as far as the stage of spinning\r\nthe cocoon. Yet I am no novice in my duties as dry-nurse. How many\r\npupils have passed through my hands and have reached the final stage in\r\nmy old sardine-boxes as well as in their native burrows! I shall draw no\r\nconclusions from this check, which my scruples may attribute to some\r\nunknown cause. Perhaps the atmosphere of my cabinet and the dryness of\r\nthe sand serving them for a bed have been too much for my nurslings,\r\nwhose tender skins are used to the warm moisture of the subsoil. Let us\r\ntry another method.\r\n\r\nTo decide positively whether honey is or is not repugnant to the grubs\r\nof the Philanthus was hardly practicable by the method just explained.\r\nThe first meals consisted of flesh, and after that nothing in\r\nparticular occurred. The honey is encountered later, when the bee is\r\nlargely consumed. If hesitation and repugnance were manifested at this\r\npoint they came too late to be conclusive; the sickness of the larvæ\r\nmight be due to other causes, known or unknown. We must offer honey at\r\nthe very beginning, before artificial rearing has spoilt the grub's\r\nappetite. To offer pure honey would, of course, be useless; no\r\ncarnivorous creature would touch it, even were it starving. I must\r\nspread the honey on meat; that is, I must smear the dead bee with honey,\r\nlightly varnishing it with a camel's-hair brush.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions the problem is solved with the first few\r\nmouthfuls. The grub, having bitten on the honeyed bee, draws back as\r\nthough disgusted; hesitates for a long time; then, urged by hunger,\r\nbegins again; tries first on one side, then on another; in the end it\r\nrefuses to touch the bee again. For a few days it pines upon its\r\nrations, which are almost intact, then dies. As many as are subjected to\r\nthe same treatment perish in the same way.\r\n\r\nDo they simply die of hunger in the presence of food which their\r\nappetites reject, or are they poisoned by the small amount of honey\r\nabsorbed at the first bites? I cannot say; but, whether poisonous or\r\nmerely repugnant, the bee smeared with honey is always fatal to them; a\r\nfact which explains more clearly than the unfavourable circumstances of\r\nthe former experiment my lack of success with the freshly killed bees.\r\n\r\nThis refusal to touch honey, whether poisonous or repugnant, is\r\nconnected with principles of alimentation too general to be a\r\ngastronomic peculiarity of the Philanthus grub. Other carnivorous\r\nlarvæ--at least in the series of the Hymenoptera--must share it. Let us\r\nexperiment. The method need not be changed. I exhume the larvæ when in a\r\nstate of medium growth, to avoid the vicissitudes of extreme youth; I\r\ncollect the bodies of the grubs and insects which form their natural\r\ndiet and smear each body with honey, in which condition I return them to\r\nthe larvæ. A distinction is apparent: all the larvæ are not equally\r\nsuited to my experiment. Those larvæ must be rejected which are\r\nnourished upon one single corpulent insect, as is that of the Scolia.\r\nThe grub attacks its prey at a determined point, plunges its head and\r\nneck into the body of the insect, skilfully divides the entrails in\r\norder to keep the remains fresh until its meal is ended, and does not\r\nemerge from the opening until all is consumed but the empty skin.\r\n\r\nTo interrupt the larva with the object of smearing the interior of its\r\nprey with honey is doubly objectionable; I might extinguish the\r\nlingering vitality which keeps putrefaction at bay in the victim, and I\r\nmight confuse the delicate art of the larva, which might not be able to\r\nrecover the lode at which it was working or to distinguish between those\r\nparts which are lawfully and properly eaten and those which must not be\r\nconsumed until a later period. As I have shown in a previous volume, the\r\ngrub of the Scolia has taught me much in this respect. The only larvæ\r\nacceptable for this experiment are those which are fed on a number of\r\nsmall insects, which are attacked without any special art, dismembered\r\nat random, and quickly consumed. Among such larvæ I have experimented\r\nwith those provided by chance--those of various Bembeces, fed on\r\nDiptera; those of the Palaris, whose diet consists of a large variety of\r\nHymenoptera; those of the Tachytus, provided with young crickets; those\r\nof the Odynerus, fed upon larvæ of the Chrysomela; those of the\r\nsand-dwelling Cerceris, endowed with a hecatomb of weevils. As will be\r\nseen, both consumers and consumed offer plenty of variety. Well, in\r\nevery case their proper diet, seasoned with honey, is fatal. Whether\r\npoisoned or disgusted, they all die in a few days.\r\n\r\nA strange result! Honey, the nectar of the flowers, the sole diet of the\r\napiary under its two forms and the sole nourishment of the predatory\r\ninsect in its adult phase, is for the larva of the same insect an object\r\nof insurmountable disgust, and probably a poison. The transfiguration of\r\nthe chrysalis surprises me less than this inversion of the appetite.\r\nWhat change occurs in the stomach of the insect that the adult should\r\npassionately seek that which the larva refuses under peril of death? It\r\nis no question of organic debility unable to support a diet too\r\nsubstantial, too hard, or too highly spiced. The grubs which consume the\r\nlarva of the Cetoniæ, for example (the Rose-chafers), those which feed\r\nupon the leathery cricket, and those whose diet is rich in nitrobenzine,\r\nmust assuredly have complacent gullets and adaptable stomachs. Yet these\r\nrobust eaters die of hunger or poison for no greater cause than a drop\r\nof syrup, the lightest diet imaginable, adapted to the weakness of\r\nextreme youth, and a delicacy to the adult! What a gulf of obscurity in\r\nthe stomach of a miserable worm!\r\n\r\nThese gastronomic experiments called for a counter-proof. The\r\ncarnivorous grub is killed by honey. Is the honey-fed grub, inversely,\r\nkilled by carnivorous diet? Here, again, we must make certain\r\nexceptions, observe a certain choice, as in the previous experiments. It\r\nwould obviously be courting a flat refusal to offer a heap of young\r\ncrickets to the larvæ of the Anthophorus and the Osmia, for example; the\r\nhoney-fed grub would not bite such food. It would be absolutely useless\r\nto make such an experiment. We must find the equivalent of the bee\r\nsmeared with honey; that is, we must offer the larva its ordinary food\r\nwith a mixture of animal matter added. I shall experiment with albumen,\r\nas provided by the egg of the hen; albumen being an isomer of fibrine,\r\nwhich is the principal element of all flesh diet.\r\n\r\n_Osmia tricornis_ will lend itself to my experiment better than any\r\nother insect on account of its dry honey, or bee-bread, which is largely\r\nformed of flowery pollen. I knead it with the albumen, graduating the\r\ndose of the latter so that its weight largely exceeds that of the\r\nbee-bread. Thus I obtain pastes of various degrees of consistency, but\r\nall firm enough to support the larva without danger of immersion. With\r\ntoo fluid a mixture there would be a danger of death by drowning.\r\nFinally, on each cake of albuminous paste I install a larva of medium\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThis diet is not distasteful; far from it. The grubs attack it without\r\nhesitation and devour it with every appearance of a normal appetite.\r\nMatters could not go better if the food had not been modified according\r\nto my recipes. All is eaten; even the portions which I feared contained\r\nan excessive proportion of albumen. Moreover--a matter of still greater\r\nimportance--the larvæ of the Osmia fed in this manner attain their\r\nnormal growth and spin their cocoons, from which adults issue in the\r\nfollowing year. Despite the albuminous diet the cycle of evolution\r\ncompletes itself without mishap.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to conclude from all this? I confess I am embarrassed. _Omne\r\nvivum ex ovo_, says the physiologist. All animals are carnivorous in\r\ntheir first beginnings; they are formed and nourished at the expense of\r\nthe egg, in which albumen predominates. The highest, the mammals, adhere\r\nto this diet for a considerable time; they live by the maternal milk,\r\nrich in casein, another isomer of albumen. The gramnivorous nestling is\r\nfed first upon worms and grubs, which are best adapted to the delicacy\r\nof its stomach; many newly born creatures among the lower orders, being\r\nimmediately left to their own devices, live on animal diet. In this way\r\nthe original method of alimentation is continued--the method which\r\nbuilds flesh out of flesh and makes blood out of blood with no chemical\r\nprocesses but those of simple reconstruction. In maturity, when the\r\nstomach is more robust, a vegetable diet may be adopted, involving a\r\nmore complex chemistry, although the food itself is more easily\r\nobtained. To milk succeeds fodder; to the worm, seeds and grain; to the\r\ndead or paralysed insects of the natal burrow, the nectar of flowers.\r\n\r\nHere is a partial explanation of the double system of the Hymenoptera\r\nwith their carnivorous larvæ--the system of dead or paralysed insects\r\nfollowed by honey. But here the point of interrogation, already\r\nencountered elsewhere, erects itself once again. Why is the larva of\r\nthe Osmia, which thrives upon albumen, actually fed upon honey during\r\nits early life? Why is a vegetable diet the rule in the hives of bees\r\nfrom the very commencement, when the other members of the same series\r\nlive upon animal food?\r\n\r\nIf I were a \"transformist\" how I should delight in this question! Yes, I\r\nshould say: yes, by the fact of its germ every animal is originally\r\ncarnivorous. The insect in particular makes a beginning with albuminoid\r\nmaterials. Many larvæ adhere to the alimentation present in the egg, as\r\ndo many adult insects also. But the struggle to fill the belly, which is\r\nactually the struggle for life, demands something better than the\r\nprecarious chances of the chase. Man, at first an eager hunter of game,\r\ncollected flocks and became a shepherd in order to profit by his\r\npossessions in time of dearth. Further progress inspired him to till the\r\nearth and sow; a method which assured him of a certain living. Evolution\r\nfrom the defective to the mediocre, and from the mediocre to the\r\nabundant, has led to the resources of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe lower animals have preceded us on the way of progress. The ancestors\r\nof the Philanthus, in the remote ages of the lacustrian tertiary\r\nformations, lived by capturing prey in both phases--both as larvæ and as\r\nadults; they hunted for their own benefit as well as for the family.\r\nThey did not confine themselves to emptying the stomach of the bee, as\r\ndo their descendants to-day; they devoured the victim entire. From\r\nbeginning to end they remained carnivorous. Later there were fortunate\r\ninnovators, whose race supplanted the more conservative element, who\r\ndiscovered an inexhaustible source of nourishment, to be obtained\r\nwithout painful search or dangerous conflict: the saccharine exudation\r\nof the flowers. The wasteful system of living upon prey, by no means\r\nfavourable to large populations, has been preserved for the feeble\r\nlarvæ; but the vigorous adult has abandoned it for an easier and more\r\nprosperous existence. Thus the Philanthus of our own days was gradually\r\ndeveloped; thus was formed the double system of nourishment practised by\r\nthe various predatory insects which we know.\r\n\r\nThe bee has done still better; from the moment of leaving the egg it\r\ndispenses completely with chance-won aliments. It has invented honey,\r\nthe food of its larvæ. Renouncing the chase for ever, and becoming\r\nexclusively agricultural, this insect has acquired a degree of moral and\r\nphysical prosperity that the predatory species are far from sharing.\r\nHence the flourishing colonies of the Anthophoræ, the Osmiæ, the Euceræ,\r\nthe Halicti, and other makers of honey, while the hunters of prey work\r\nin isolation; hence the societies in which the bee displays its\r\nadmirable talents, the supreme expression of instinct.\r\n\r\nThis is what I should say if I were a \"transformist.\" All this is a\r\nchain of highly logical deductions, and it hangs together with a certain\r\nair of reality, such as we like to look for in a host of \"transformist\"\r\narguments which are put forward as irrefutable. Well, I make a present\r\nof my deductive theory to whosoever desires it, and without the least\r\nregret; I do not believe a single word of it, and I confess my profound\r\nignorance of the origin of the twofold system of diet.\r\n\r\nOne thing I do see more clearly after all my experiments and research:\r\nthe tactics of the Philanthus. As a witness of its ferocious feasting,\r\nthe true motive of which was unknown to me, I treated it to all the\r\nunfavourable epithets I could think of; called it assassin, bandit,\r\npirate, robber of the dead. Ignorance is always abusive; the man who\r\ndoes not know is full of violent affirmations and malign\r\ninterpretations. Undeceived by the facts, I hasten to apologise and\r\nexpress my esteem for the Philanthus. In emptying the stomach of the bee\r\nthe mother is performing the most praiseworthy of all duties; she is\r\nguarding her family against poison. If she sometimes kills on her own\r\naccount and abandons the body after exhausting it of honey, I dare not\r\ncall her action a crime. When the habit has once been formed of emptying\r\nthe bee's crop for the best of motives, the temptation is great to do so\r\nwith no other excuse than hunger. Moreover--who can say?--perhaps there\r\nis always some afterthought that the larvæ might profit by the\r\nsacrifice. Although not carried into effect the intention excuses the\r\nact.\r\n\r\nI therefore withdraw my abusive epithets in order to express my\r\nadmiration of the creature's maternal logic. Honey would be harmful to\r\nthe grubs. How does the mother know that honey, in which she herself\r\ndelights, is noxious to her young? To this question our knowledge has no\r\nreply. But honey, as we have seen, would endanger the lives of the\r\ngrubs. The bees must therefore be emptied of honey before they are fed\r\nto them. The process must be effected without wounding the victim, for\r\nthe larva must receive the latter fresh and moist; and this would be\r\nimpracticable if the insect were paralysed on account of the natural\r\nresistance of the organs. The bee must therefore be killed outright\r\ninstead of being paralysed, otherwise the honey could not be removed.\r\nInstantaneous death can be assured only by a lesion of the primordial\r\ncentre of life. The sting must therefore pierce the cervical ganglions;\r\nthe centre of innervation upon which the rest of the organism is\r\ndependent. This can only be reached in one way: through the neck. Here\r\nit is that the sting will be inserted; and here it is inserted in a\r\nbreach in the armour no larger than a pin's head. Suppress a single link\r\nof this closely knit chain, and the Philanthus reared upon the flesh of\r\nbees becomes an impossibility.\r\n\r\nThat honey is fatal to larvæ is a fact pregnant with consequences.\r\nVarious predatory insects feed their young with honey-makers. Such, to\r\nmy knowledge, are the _Philanthus coronatus_, Fabr., which stores its\r\nburrows with the large Halictus; the _Philanthus raptor_, Lep., which\r\nchases all the smaller Halictus indifferently, being itself a small\r\ninsect; the _Cerceris ornata_, Fabr., which also kills Halictus; and the\r\n_Polaris flavipes_, Fabr., which by a strange eclecticism fills its\r\ncells with specimens of most of the Hymenoptera which are not beyond its\r\npowers. What do these four huntresses, and others of similar habits, do\r\nwith their victims when the crops of the latter are full of honey? They\r\nmust follow the example of the Philanthus or their offspring would\r\nperish; they must squeeze and manipulate the dead bee until it yields up\r\nits honey. Everything goes to prove as much; but for the actual\r\nobservation of what would be a notable proof of my theory I must trust\r\nto the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT PEACOCK, OR EMPEROR MOTH\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a memorable night! I will name it the Night of the Great Peacock.\r\nWho does not know this superb moth, the largest of all our European\r\nbutterflies[3] with its livery of chestnut velvet and its collar of\r\nwhite fur? The greys and browns of the wings are crossed by a paler\r\nzig-zag, and bordered with smoky white; and in the centre of each wing\r\nis a round spot, a great eye with a black pupil and variegated iris,\r\nresolving into concentric arcs of black, white, chestnut, and purplish\r\nred.\r\n\r\nNot less remarkable is the caterpillar. Its colour is a vague yellow. On\r\nthe summit of thinly sown tubercles crowned with a palisade of black\r\nhairs are set pearls of a turquoise-blue. The burly brown cocoon, which\r\nis notable for its curious tunnel of exit, like an eel-pot, is always\r\nfound at the base of an old almond-tree, adhering to the bark. The\r\nfoliage of the same tree nourishes the caterpillar.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 6th of May a female emerged from her cocoon in my\r\npresence on my laboratory table. I cloistered her immediately, all damp\r\nwith the moisture of metamorphosis, in a cover of wire gauze. I had no\r\nparticular intentions regarding her; I imprisoned her from mere habit;\r\nthe habit of an observer always on the alert for what may happen.\r\n\r\nI was richly rewarded. About nine o'clock that evening, when the\r\nhousehold was going to bed, there was a sudden hubbub in the room next\r\nto mine. Little Paul, half undressed, was rushing to and fro, running,\r\njumping, stamping, and overturning the chairs as if possessed. I heard\r\nhim call me. \"Come quick!\" he shrieked; \"come and see these butterflies!\r\nBig as birds! The room's full of them!\"\r\n\r\nI ran. There was that which justified the child's enthusiasm and his\r\nhardly hyperbolical exclamation. It was an invasion of giant\r\nbutterflies; an invasion hitherto unexampled in our house. Four were\r\nalready caught and placed in a bird-cage. Others--numbers of them--were\r\nflying across the ceiling.\r\n\r\nThis astonishing sight recalled the prisoner of the morning to my mind.\r\n\"Put on your togs, kiddy!\" I told my son; \"put down your cage, and come\r\nwith me. We shall see something worth seeing.\"\r\n\r\nWe had to go downstairs to reach my study, which occupies the right wing\r\nof the house. In the kitchen we met the servant; she too was bewildered\r\nby the state of affairs. She was pursuing the huge butterflies with her\r\napron, having taken them at first for bats.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as though the Great Peacock had taken possession of my whole\r\nhouse, more or less. What would it be upstairs, where the prisoner was,\r\nthe cause of this invasion? Happily one of the two study windows had\r\nbeen left ajar; the road was open.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT PEACOCK OR EMPEROR MOTH.]\r\n\r\nCandle in hand, we entered the room. What we saw is unforgettable. With\r\na soft _flic-flac_ the great night-moths were flying round the\r\nwire-gauze cover, alighting, taking flight, returning, mounting to the\r\nceiling, re-descending. They rushed at the candle and extinguished it\r\nwith a flap of the wing; they fluttered on our shoulders, clung to our\r\nclothing, grazed our faces. My study had become a cave of a necromancer,\r\nthe darkness alive with creatures of the night! Little Paul, to reassure\r\nhimself, held my hand much tighter than usual.\r\n\r\nHow many were there? About twenty. To these add those which had strayed\r\ninto the kitchen, the nursery, and other rooms in the house, and the\r\ntotal must have been nearly forty. It was a memorable sight--the Night\r\nof the Great Peacock! Come from all points of the compass, warned I know\r\nnot how, here were forty lovers eager to do homage to the maiden\r\nprincess that morning born in the sacred precincts of my study.\r\n\r\nFor the time being I troubled the swarm of pretenders no further. The\r\nflame of the candle endangered the visitors; they threw themselves into\r\nit stupidly and singed themselves slightly. On the morrow we could\r\nresume our study of them, and make certain carefully devised\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nTo clear the ground a little for what is to follow, let me speak of what\r\nwas repeated every night during the eight nights my observations lasted.\r\nEvery night, when it was quite dark, between eight and ten o'clock, the\r\nbutterflies arrived one by one. The weather was stormy; the sky heavily\r\nclouded; the darkness was so profound that out of doors, in the garden\r\nand away from the trees, one could scarcely see one's hand before one's\r\nface.\r\n\r\nIn addition to such darkness as this there were certain difficulties of\r\naccess. The house is hidden by great plane-trees; an alley densely\r\nbordered with lilacs and rose-trees make a kind of outer vestibule to\r\nthe entrance; it is protected from the _mistral_ by groups of pines and\r\nscreens of cypress. A thicket of evergreen shrubs forms a rampart at a\r\nfew paces from the door. It was across this maze of leafage, and in\r\nabsolute darkness, that the butterflies had to find their way in order\r\nto attain the end of their pilgrimage.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions the screech-owl would not dare to forsake its\r\nhollow in the olive-tree. The butterfly, better endowed with its faceted\r\neyes than the owl with its single pupils, goes forward without\r\nhesitation, and threads the obstacles without contact. So well it\r\ndirects its tortuous flight that, in spite of all the obstacles to be\r\nevaded, it arrives in a state of perfect freshness, its great wings\r\nintact, without the slightest flaw. The darkness is light enough for the\r\nbutterfly.\r\n\r\nEven if we suppose it to be sensitive to rays unknown to the ordinary\r\nretina, this extraordinary sight could not be the sense that warns the\r\nbutterfly at a distance and brings it hastening to the bride. Distance\r\nand the objects interposed make the suggestion absurd.\r\n\r\nMoreover, apart from illusory refractions, of which there is no question\r\nhere, the indications of light are precise; one goes straight to the\r\nobject seen. But the butterfly was sometimes mistaken: not in the\r\ngeneral direction, but concerning the precise position of the attractive\r\nobject. I have mentioned that the nursery on the other side of the house\r\nto my study, which was the actual goal of the visitors, was full of\r\nbutterflies before a light was taken into it. These were certainly\r\nincorrectly informed. In the kitchen there was the same crowd of\r\nseekers gone astray; but there the light of a lamp, an irresistible\r\nattraction to nocturnal insects, might have diverted the pilgrims.\r\n\r\nLet us consider only such areas as were in darkness. There the pilgrims\r\nwere numerous. I found them almost everywhere in the neighbourhood of\r\ntheir goal. When the captive was in my study the butterflies did not all\r\nenter by the open window, the direct and easy way, the captive being\r\nonly a few yards from the window. Several penetrated the house\r\ndownstairs, wandered through the hall, and reached the staircase, which\r\nwas barred at the top by a closed door.\r\n\r\nThese data show us that the visitors to the wedding-feast did not go\r\nstraight to their goal as they would have done were they attracted by\r\nany kind of luminous radiations, whether known or unknown to our\r\nphysical science. Something other than radiant energy warned them at a\r\ndistance, led them to the neighbourhood of the precise spot, and left\r\nthe final discovery to be made after a vague and hesitating search. The\r\nsenses of hearing and smell warn us very much in this way; they are not\r\nprecise guides when we try to determine exactly the point of origin of a\r\nsound or smell.\r\n\r\nWhat sense is it that informs this great butterfly of the whereabouts of\r\nhis mate, and leads him wandering through the night? What organ does\r\nthis sense affect? One suspects the antennæ; in the male butterfly they\r\nactually seem to be sounding, interrogating empty space with their long\r\nfeathery plumes. Are these splendid plumes merely items of finery, or do\r\nthey really play a part in the perception of the effluvia which guide\r\nthe lover? It seemed easy, on the occasion I spoke of, to devise a\r\nconclusive experiment.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow of the invasion I found in my study eight of my nocturnal\r\nvisitors. They were perched, motionless, upon the cross-mouldings of the\r\nsecond window, which had remained closed. The others, having concluded\r\ntheir ballet by about ten o'clock at night, had left as they had\r\nentered, by the other window, which was left open night and day. These\r\neight persevering lovers were just what I required for my experiment.\r\n\r\nWith a sharp pair of scissors, and without otherwise touching the\r\nbutterflies, I cut off their antennæ near the base. The victims barely\r\nnoticed the operation. None moved; there was scarcely a flutter of the\r\nwings. Their condition was excellent; the wound did not seem to be in\r\nthe least serious. They were not perturbed by physical suffering, and\r\nwould therefore be all the better adapted to my designs. They passed the\r\nrest of the day in placid immobility on the cross-bars of the window.\r\n\r\nA few other arrangements were still to be made. In particular it was\r\nnecessary to change the scene; not to leave the female under the eyes of\r\nthe mutilated butterflies at the moment of resuming their nocturnal\r\nflight; the difficulty of the search must not be lessened. I therefore\r\nremoved the cage and its captive, and placed it under a porch on the\r\nother side of the house, at a distance of some fifty paces from my\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall I went for a last time to inspect my eight victims. Six had\r\nleft by the open window; two still remained, but they had fallen on the\r\nfloor, and no longer had the strength to recover themselves if turned\r\nover on their backs. They were exhausted, dying. Do not accuse my\r\nsurgery, however. Such early decease was observed repeatedly, with no\r\nintervention on my part.\r\n\r\nSix, in better condition, had departed. Would they return to the call\r\nthat attracted them the night before? Deprived of their antennæ, would\r\nthey be able to find the captive, now placed at a considerable distance\r\nfrom her original position?\r\n\r\nThe cage was in darkness, almost in the open air. From time to time I\r\nvisited it with a net and lantern. The visitors were captured,\r\ninspected, and immediately released in a neighbouring room, of which I\r\nclosed the door. This gradual elimination allowed me to count the\r\nvisitors exactly without danger of counting the same butterfly more than\r\nonce. Moreover, the provisional prison, large and bare, in no wise\r\nharmed or endangered the prisoners; they found a quiet retreat there and\r\nample space. Similar precautions were taken during the rest of my\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\nAfter half-past ten no more arrived. The reception was over. Total,\r\ntwenty-five males captured, of which one only was deprived of its\r\nantennæ. So of the six operated on earlier in the day, which were strong\r\nenough to leave my study and fly back to the fields, only one had\r\nreturned to the cage. A poor result, in which I could place no\r\nconfidence as proving whether the antennæ did or did not play a\r\ndirecting part. It was necessary to begin again upon a larger scale.\r\n\r\nNext morning I visited the prisoners of the day before. What I saw was\r\nnot encouraging. A large number were scattered on the ground, almost\r\ninert. Taken between the fingers, several of them gave scarcely a sign\r\nof life. Little was to be hoped from these, it would seem. Still, I\r\ndetermined to try; perhaps they would regain their vigour at the lover's\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-four prisoners were all subjected to the amputation of their\r\nantennæ. The one operated on the day before was put aside as dying or\r\nnearly so. Finally the door of the prison was left open for the rest of\r\nthe day. Those might leave who could; those could join in the carnival\r\nwho were able. In order to put those that might leave the room to the\r\ntest of a search, the cage, which they must otherwise have encountered\r\nat the threshold, was again removed, and placed in a room of the\r\nopposite wing, on the ground floor. There was of course free access to\r\nthis room.\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-four lacking their antennæ sixteen only left the room.\r\nEight were powerless to do so; they were dying. Of the sixteen, how many\r\nreturned to the cage that night? Not one. My captives that night were\r\nonly seven, all new-comers, all wearing antennæ. This result seemed to\r\nprove that the amputation of the antennæ was a matter of serious\r\nsignificance. But it would not do to conclude as yet: one doubt\r\nremained.\r\n\r\n\"A fine state I am in! How shall I dare to appear before the other\r\ndogs?\" said Mouflard, the puppy whose ears had been pitilessly docked.\r\nHad my butterflies apprehensions similar to Master Mouflard's? Deprived\r\nof their beautiful plumes, were they ashamed to appear in the midst of\r\ntheir rivals, and to prefer their suits? Was it confusion on their part,\r\nor want of guidance? Was it not rather exhaustion after an attempt\r\nexceeding the duration of an ephemeral passion? Experience would show\r\nme.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth night I took fourteen new-comers and set them apart as\r\nthey came in a room in which they spent the night. On the morrow,\r\nprofiting by their diurnal immobility, I removed a little of the hair\r\nfrom the centre of the corselet or neck. This slight tonsure did not\r\ninconvenience the insects, so easily was the silky fur removed, nor did\r\nit deprive them of any organ which might later on be necessary in the\r\nsearch for the female. To them it was nothing; for me it was the\r\nunmistakable sign of a repeated visit.\r\n\r\nThis time there were none incapable of flight. At night the fourteen\r\nshavelings escaped into the open air. The cage, of course, was again in\r\na new place. In two hours I captured twenty butterflies, of whom two\r\nwere tonsured; no more. As for those whose antennæ I had amputated the\r\nnight before, not one reappeared. Their nuptial period was over.\r\n\r\nOf fourteen marked by the tonsure two only returned. Why did the other\r\ntwelve fail to appear, although furnished with their supposed guides,\r\ntheir antennæ? To this I can see only one reply: that the Great Peacock\r\nis promptly exhausted by the ardours of the mating season.\r\n\r\nWith a view to mating, the sole end of its life, the great moth is\r\nendowed with a marvellous prerogative. It has the power to discover the\r\nobject of its desire in spite of distance, in spite of obstacles. A few\r\nhours, for two or three nights, are given to its search, its nuptial\r\nflights. If it cannot profit by them, all is ended; the compass fails,\r\nthe lamp expires. What profit could life hold henceforth? Stoically the\r\ncreature withdraws into a corner and sleeps the last sleep, the end of\r\nillusions and the end of suffering.\r\n\r\nThe Great Peacock exists as a butterfly only to perpetuate itself. It\r\nknows nothing of food. While so many others, joyful banqueters, fly from\r\nflower to flower, unrolling their spiral trunks to plunge them into\r\nhoneyed blossoms, this incomparable ascetic, completely freed from the\r\nservitude of the stomach, has no means of restoring its strength. Its\r\nbuccal members are mere vestiges, useless simulacra, not real organs\r\nable to perform their duties. Not a sip of honey can ever enter its\r\nstomach; a magnificent prerogative, if it is not long enjoyed. If the\r\nlamp is to burn it must be filled with oil. The Great Peacock renounces\r\nthe joys of the palate; but with them it surrenders long life. Two or\r\nthree nights--just long enough to allow the couple to meet and mate--and\r\nall is over; the great butterfly is dead.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is meant by the non-appearance of those whose antennæ I\r\nremoved? Did they prove that the lack of antennæ rendered them incapable\r\nof finding the cage in which the prisoner waited? By no means. Like\r\nthose marked with the tonsure, which had undergone no damaging\r\noperation, they proved only that their time was finished. Mutilated or\r\nintact, they could do no more on account of age, and their absence meant\r\nnothing. Owing to the delay inseparable from the experiment, the part\r\nplayed by the antennæ escaped me. It was doubtful before; it remained\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nMy prisoner under the wire-gauze cover lived for eight days. Every night\r\nshe attracted a swarm of visitors, now to one part of the house, now to\r\nanother. I caught them with the net and released them as soon as\r\ncaptured in a closed room, where they passed the night. On the next day\r\nthey were marked, by means of a slight tonsure on the thorax.\r\n\r\nThe total number of butterflies attracted on these eight nights amounted\r\nto a hundred and fifty; a stupendous number when I consider what\r\nsearches I had to undertake during the two following years in order to\r\ncollect the specimens necessary to the continuation of my investigation.\r\nWithout being absolutely undiscoverable, in my immediate neighbourhood\r\nthe cocoons of the Great Peacock are at least extremely rare, as the\r\ntrees on which they are found are not common. For two winters I visited\r\nall the decrepit almond-trees at hand, inspected them all at the base of\r\nthe trunk, under the jungle of stubborn grasses and undergrowth that\r\nsurrounded them; and how often I returned with empty hands! Thus my\r\nhundred and fifty butterflies had come from some little distance;\r\nperhaps from a radius of a mile and a quarter or more. How did they\r\nlearn of what was happening in my study?\r\n\r\nThree agents of information affect the senses at a distance: sight,\r\nsound, and smell. Can we speak of vision in this connection? Sight could\r\nvery well guide the arrivals once they had entered the open window; but\r\nhow could it help them out of doors, among unfamiliar surroundings? Even\r\nthe fabulous eye of the lynx, which could see through walls, would not\r\nbe sufficient; we should have to imagine a keenness of vision capable of\r\nannihilating leagues of space. It is needless to discuss the matter\r\nfurther; sight cannot be the guiding sense.\r\n\r\nSound is equally out of the question. The big-bodied creature capable of\r\ncalling her mates from such a distance is absolutely mute, even to the\r\nmost sensitive ear. Does she perhaps emit vibrations of such delicacy or\r\nrapidity that only the most sensitive microphone could appreciate them?\r\nThe idea is barely possible; but let us remember that the visitors must\r\nhave been warned at distances of some thousands of yards. Under these\r\nconditions it is useless to think of acoustics.\r\n\r\nSmell remains. Scent, better than any other impression in the domain of\r\nour senses, would explain the invasion of butterflies, and their\r\ndifficulty at the very last in immediately finding the object of their\r\nsearch. Are there effluvia analogous to what we call odour: effluvia of\r\nextreme subtlety, absolutely imperceptible to us, yet capable of\r\nstimulating a sense-organ far more sensitive than our own? A simple\r\nexperiment suggested itself. I would mask these effluvia, stifle them\r\nunder a powerful, tenacious odour, which would take complete possession\r\nof the sense-organ and neutralise the less powerful impression.\r\n\r\nI began by sprinkling naphthaline in the room intended for the reception\r\nof the males that evening. Beside the female, inside the wire-gauze\r\ncover, I placed a large capsule full of the same substance. When the\r\nhour of the nocturnal visit arrived I had only to stand at the door of\r\nthe room to smell a smell as of a gas-works. Well, my artifice failed.\r\nThe butterflies arrived as usual, entered the room, traversed its\r\ngas-laden atmosphere, and made for the wire-gauze cover with the same\r\ncertainty as in a room full of fresh air.\r\n\r\nMy confidence in the olfactory theory was shaken. Moreover, I could not\r\ncontinue my experiments. On the ninth day, exhausted by her fruitless\r\nperiod of waiting, the female died, having first deposited her barren\r\neggs upon the woven wire of her cage. Lacking a female, nothing could be\r\ndone until the following year.\r\n\r\nI determined next time to take suitable precautions and to make all\r\npreparations for repeating at will the experiments already made and\r\nothers which I had in mind. I set to work at once, without delay.\r\n\r\nIn the summer I began to buy caterpillars at a halfpenny apiece.\r\n\r\nThe market was in the hands of some neighbouring urchins, my habitual\r\nproviders. On Friday, free of the terrors of grammar, they scoured the\r\nfields, finding from time to time the Great Peacock caterpillar, and\r\nbringing it to me clinging to the end of a stick. They did not dare to\r\ntouch it, poor little imps! They were thunderstruck at my audacity when\r\nI seized it in my fingers as they would the familiar silkworm.\r\n\r\nReared upon twigs of the almond-tree, my menagerie soon provided me with\r\nmagnificent cocoons. In winter assiduous search at the base of the\r\nnative trees completed my collection. Friends interested in my\r\nresearches came to my aid. Finally, after some trouble, what with an\r\nopen market, commercial negotiations, and searching, at the cost of many\r\nscratches, in the undergrowth, I became the owner of an assortment of\r\ncocoons of which twelve, larger and heavier than the rest, announced\r\nthat they were those of females.\r\n\r\nDisappointment awaited me. May arrived; a capricious month which set my\r\npreparations at naught, troublesome as these had been. Winter returned.\r\nThe _mistral_ shrieked, tore the budding leaves of the plane-trees, and\r\nscattered them over the ground. It was cold as December. We had to\r\nlight fires in the evening, and resume the heavy clothes we had begun to\r\nleave off.\r\n\r\nMy butterflies were too sorely tried. They emerged late and were torpid.\r\nAround my cages, in which the females waited--to-day one, to-morrow\r\nanother, according to the order of their birth--few males or none came\r\nfrom without. Yet there were some in the neighbourhood, for those with\r\nlarge antennæ which issued from my collection of cocoons were placed in\r\nthe garden directly they had emerged, and were recognised. Whether\r\nneighbours or strangers, very few came, and those without enthusiasm.\r\nFor a moment they entered, then disappeared and did not reappear. The\r\nlovers were as cold as the season.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, too, the low temperature was unfavourable to the informing\r\neffluvia, which might well be increased by heat and lessened by cold as\r\nis the case with many odours. My year was lost. Research is\r\ndisappointing work when the experimenter is the slave of the return and\r\nthe caprices of a brief season of the year.\r\n\r\nFor the third time I began again. I reared caterpillars; I scoured the\r\ncountry in search of cocoons. When May returned I was tolerably\r\nprovided. The season was fine, responding to my hopes. I foresaw the\r\naffluence of butterflies which had so impressed me at the outset, when\r\nthe famous invasion occurred which was the origin of my experiments.\r\n\r\nEvery night, by squadrons of twelve, twenty, or more, the visitors\r\nappeared. The female, a strapping, big-bellied matron, clung to the\r\nwoven wire of the cover. There was no movement on her part; not even a\r\nflutter of the wings. One would have thought her indifferent to all\r\nthat occurred. No odour was emitted that was perceptible to the most\r\nsensitive nostrils of the household; no sound that the keenest ears of\r\nthe household could perceive. Motionless, recollected, she waited.\r\n\r\nThe males, by twos, by threes and more, fluttered upon the dome of the\r\ncover, scouring over it quickly in all directions, beating it\r\ncontinually with the ends of their wings. There were no conflicts\r\nbetween rivals. Each did his best to penetrate the enclosure, without\r\nbetraying any sign of jealousy of the others. Tiring of their fruitless\r\nattempts, they would fly away and join the dance of the gyrating crowd.\r\nSome, in despair, would escape by the open window: new-comers would\r\nreplace them: and until ten o'clock or thereabouts the wire dome of the\r\ncover would be the scene of continual attempts at approach, incessantly\r\ncommencing, quickly wearying, quickly resumed.\r\n\r\nEvery night the position of the cage was changed. I placed it north of\r\nthe house and south; on the ground-floor and the first floor; in the\r\nright wing of the house, or fifty yards away in the left wing; in the\r\nopen air, or hidden in some distant room. All these sudden removals,\r\ndevised to put the seekers off the scent, troubled them not at all. My\r\ntime and my pains were wasted, so far as deceiving them was concerned.\r\n\r\nThe memory of places has no part in the finding of the female. For\r\ninstance, the day before the cage was installed in a certain room. The\r\nmales visited the room and fluttered about the cage for a couple of\r\nhours, and some even passed the night there. On the following day, at\r\nsunset, when I moved the cage, all were out of doors. Although their\r\nlives are so ephemeral, the youngest were ready to resume their\r\nnocturnal expeditions a second and even a third time. Where did they\r\nfirst go, these veterans of a day?\r\n\r\nThey knew precisely where the cage had been the night before. One would\r\nhave expected them to return to it, guided by memory; and that not\r\nfinding it they would go out to continue their search elsewhere. No;\r\ncontrary to my expectation, nothing of the kind appeared. None came to\r\nthe spot which had been so crowded the night before; none paid even a\r\npassing visit. The room was recognised as an empty room, with no\r\nprevious examination, such as would apparently be necessary to\r\ncontradict the memory of the place. A more positive guide than memory\r\ncalled them elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHitherto the female was always visible, behind the meshes of the\r\nwire-gauze cover. The visitors, seeing plainly in the dark night, must\r\nhave been able to see her by the vague luminosity of what for us is the\r\ndark. What would happen if I imprisoned her in an opaque receptacle?\r\nWould not such a receptacle arrest or set free the informing effluvia\r\naccording to its nature?\r\n\r\nPractical physics has given us wireless telegraphy by means of the\r\nHertzian vibrations of the ether. Had the Great Peacock butterfly\r\noutstripped and anticipated mankind in this direction? In order to\r\ndisturb the whole surrounding neighbourhood, to warn pretenders at a\r\ndistance of a mile or more, does the newly emerged female make use of\r\nelectric or magnetic waves, known or unknown, that a screen of one\r\nmaterial would arrest while another would allow them to pass? In a word,\r\ndoes she, after her fashion, employ a system of wireless telegraphy? I\r\nsee nothing impossible in this; insects are responsible for many\r\ninventions equally marvellous.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I lodged the female in boxes of various materials; boxes of\r\ntin-plate, wood, and cardboard. All were hermetically closed, even\r\nsealed with a greasy paste. I also used a glass bell resting upon a\r\nbase-plate of glass.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions not a male arrived; not one, though the warmth\r\nand quiet of the evening were propitious. Whatever its nature, whether\r\nof glass, metal, card, or wood, the closed receptacle was evidently an\r\ninsuperable obstacle to the warning effluvia.\r\n\r\nA layer of cotton-wool two fingers in thickness had the same result. I\r\nplaced the female in a large glass jar, and laced a piece of thin cotton\r\nbatting over the mouth for a cover; this again guarded the secret of my\r\nlaboratory. Not a male appeared.\r\n\r\nBut when I placed the females in boxes which were imperfectly closed, or\r\nwhich had chinks in their sides, or even hid them in a drawer or a\r\ncupboard, I found the males arrived in numbers as great as when the\r\nobject of their search lay in the cage of open wire-work freely exposed\r\non a table. I have a vivid memory of one evening when the recluse was\r\nhidden in a hat-box at the bottom of a wall-cupboard. The arrivals went\r\nstraight to the closed doors, and beat them with their wings, _toc-toc_,\r\ntrying to enter. Wandering pilgrims, come from I know not where, across\r\nfields and meadows, they knew perfectly what was behind the doors of the\r\ncupboard.\r\n\r\nSo we must abandon the idea that the butterfly has any means of\r\ncommunication comparable to our wireless telegraphy, as any kind of\r\nscreen, whether a good or a bad conductor, completely stops the signals\r\nof the female. To give them free passage and allow them to penetrate to\r\na distance one condition is indispensable: the enclosure in which the\r\ncaptive is confined must not be hermetically sealed; there must be a\r\ncommunication between it and the outer air. This again points to the\r\nprobability of an odour, although this is contradicted by my experiment\r\nwith the naphthaline.\r\n\r\nMy cocoons were all hatched, and the problem was still obscure. Should I\r\nbegin all over again in the fourth year? I did not do so, for the reason\r\nthat it is difficult to observe a nocturnal butterfly if one wishes to\r\nfollow it in all its intimate actions. The lover needs no light to\r\nattain his ends; but my imperfect human vision cannot penetrate the\r\ndarkness. I should require a candle at least, and a candle would be\r\nconstantly extinguished by the revolving swarm. A lantern would obviate\r\nthese eclipses, but its doubtful light, interspersed with heavy shadows,\r\nby no means commends it to the scruples of an observer, who must see,\r\nand see well.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the light of a lamp diverts the butterflies from their object,\r\ndistracts them from their affairs, and seriously compromises the success\r\nof the observer. The moment they enter, they rush frantically at the\r\nflame, singe their down, and thereupon, terrified by the heat, are of no\r\nprofit to the observer. If, instead of being roasted, they are held at a\r\ndistance by an envelope of glass, they press as closely as they can to\r\nthe flame, and remain motionless, hypnotised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT PEACOCK MOTH. THE PILGRIMS DIVERTED BY THE\r\nLIGHT OF A LAMP.]\r\n\r\nOne night, the female being in the dining-room, on the table, facing the\r\nopen window, a petroleum lamp, furnished with a large reflector in\r\nopaline glass, was hanging from the ceiling. The arrivals alighted on\r\nthe dome of the wire-gauze cover, crowding eagerly about the\r\nprisoner; others, saluting her in passing, flew to the lamp, circled\r\nround it a few times, and then, fascinated by the luminous splendour\r\nradiating from the opal cone of light, clung there motionless under the\r\nreflector. Already the children were raising their hands to seize them.\r\n\"Leave them,\" I said, \"leave them. Let us be hospitable: do not disturb\r\nthe pilgrims who have come to the tabernacle of the light.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the whole evening not one of them moved. Next day they were still\r\nthere. The intoxication of the light had made them forget the\r\nintoxication of love.\r\n\r\nWith creatures so madly in love with the light precise and prolonged\r\nexperimentation is impracticable the moment the observer requires\r\nartificial light. I renounced the Great Peacock and its nocturnal\r\nhabits. I required a butterfly with different habits; equally notable as\r\na lover, but seeking out the beloved by day.\r\n\r\nBefore going on to speak of my experiments with a subject fulfilling\r\nthese conditions, let me break the chronological order of my record in\r\norder to say a few words concerning another insect, which appeared after\r\nI had completed these inquiries. I refer to the Lesser Peacock (_Attacus\r\npavonia minor_, Lin.).\r\n\r\nSome one brought me, from what locality I do not know, a superb cocoon\r\nenveloped in an ample wrapping of white silk. From this covering, which\r\nlay in large irregular folds, the chrysalis was easily detached; in\r\nshape like that of the Great Peacock, but considerably less in size. The\r\nanterior extremity, which is defended by an arrangement of fine twigs,\r\nconverging, and free at the converging ends, forming a device not unlike\r\nan eel-pot, which presents access to the chrysalis while allowing the\r\nbutterfly to emerge without breaking the defence, indicated a relative\r\nof the great nocturnal butterfly; the silk-work denoted a spinning\r\ncaterpillar.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of March this curious cocoon yielded up a female of the\r\nLesser Peacock, which was immediately sequestered under a wire-gauze\r\ncover in my study. I opened the window to allow news of the event to\r\nreach the surrounding country, and left it open so that such visitors as\r\npresented themselves should find free access to the cage. The captive\r\nclung to the wire gauze and did not move for a week.\r\n\r\nShe was a superb creature, this prisoner of mine, with her suit of brown\r\nvelvet, crossed by undulating lines. The neck was surrounded by white\r\nfur; there was a carmine spot at the extremity of the upper wings, and\r\nfour great eyes in which were grouped, in concentric crescents, black,\r\nwhite, red, and yellow ochre: almost the colouring of the Great Peacock,\r\nbut more vivid. Three or four times in my life I had encountered this\r\nbutterfly, so remarkable for its size and its costume. The cocoon I had\r\nrecently seen for the first time; the male I had never seen. I only knew\r\nthat, according to the books, it was half the size of the female, and\r\nless vividly coloured, with orange-yellow on the lower wings.\r\n\r\nWould he appear, the elegant unknown, with waving plumes; the butterfly\r\nI had never yet seen, so rare does the Lesser Peacock seem to be in our\r\ncountry? Would he, in some distant hedge, receive warning of the bride\r\nwho waited on my study table? I dared to hope it, and I was right. He\r\narrived even sooner than I had hoped.\r\n\r\nNoon struck as we were sitting down to table, when little Paul, delayed\r\nby his absorption in the expected event, suddenly ran to rejoin us, his\r\ncheeks glowing. Between his fingers we saw the fluttering wings of a\r\nhandsome butterfly, caught but a moment before, while it was hovering in\r\nfront of my study. He showed it me, questioning me with his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Aha!\" I cried, \"this is precisely the pilgrim we are waiting for. Fold\r\nyour napkin and come and see what happens. We will dine later.\"\r\n\r\nDinner was forgotten before the marvels that came to pass. With\r\ninconceivable punctuality the butterflies hastened to meet the magical\r\ncall of the captive. With tortuous flight they arrived one by one. All\r\ncame from the north. This detail is significant. A week earlier there\r\nhad been a savage return of the winter. The _bise_ blew tempestuously,\r\nkilling the early almond blossom. It was one of those ferocious storms\r\nwhich in the South commonly serve as a prelude to the spring. But the\r\ntemperature had now suddenly softened, although the wind still blew from\r\nthe north.\r\n\r\nNow on this first occasion all the butterflies hastening to the prisoner\r\nentered the garden from the north. They followed the direction of the\r\nwind; not one flew against it. If their guide was a sense of smell like\r\nours, if they were guided by fragrant atoms suspended in the air, they\r\nshould have arrived in the opposite direction. Coming from the south, we\r\nmight believe them to be warned by effluvia carried on the wind; coming\r\nfrom the north in time of _mistral_, that resistless sweeper of earth\r\nand air, how can we suppose that they had perceived, at a remote\r\ndistance, what we will call an odour? The idea of a flow of odoriferous\r\natoms in a direction contrary to that of the aerial torrent seems to me\r\ninadmissible.\r\n\r\nFor two hours, under a radiant sun, the visitors came and went before\r\nthe outer wall of the study. Most of them sought for a long time,\r\nexploring the wall, flying on a level with the ground. To see them thus\r\nhesitating you would say that they were puzzled to find the exact\r\nposition of the lure which called them. Although they had come from such\r\na distance without a mistake, they seemed imperfectly informed once they\r\nwere on the spot. Nevertheless, sooner or later they entered the room\r\nand saluted the captive, without showing any great ardour. At two\r\no'clock all was over. Ten butterflies had arrived.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole week, and always about noon, at the hour of the\r\nbrightest sunlight, the butterflies arrived, but in decreasing numbers.\r\nThe total approached forty. I thought it useless to repeat experiments\r\nwhich would add nothing to what I had already learned. I will confine\r\nmyself to stating two facts. In the first place, the Lesser Peacock is\r\ndiurnal; that is to say, it celebrates its mating under the dazzling\r\nbrilliance of noon. It needs the full force of the sunlight. The Great\r\nPeacock, on the contrary, which it so closely resembles both in its\r\nadult form and the work of its caterpillar, requires the darkness of the\r\nfirst hours of the night. Who can explain this strange contrast in\r\nhabits?\r\n\r\nIn the second place, a powerful current of air, sweeping away in a\r\ncontrary direction all particles that might inform the sense of smell,\r\ndoes not prevent the butterflies from arriving from a direction opposite\r\nto that taken by the effluvial stream, as we understand such matters.\r\n\r\nTo continue: I needed a diurnal moth or butterfly: not the Lesser\r\nPeacock, which came too late, when I had nothing to ask of it, but\r\nanother, no matter what, provided it was a prompt guest at the wedding\r\nfeast. Was I to find such an insect?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE OAK EGGAR, OR BANDED MONK\r\n\r\n\r\nYes: I was to find it. I even had it already in my possession. An urchin\r\nof seven years, with an alert countenance, not washed every day, bare\r\nfeet, and dilapidated breeches supported by a piece of string, who\r\nfrequented the house as a dealer in turnips and tomatoes, arrived one\r\nday with his basket of vegetables. Having received the few halfpence\r\nexpected by his mother as the price of the garden-stuff, and having\r\ncounted them one by one into the hollow of his hand, he took from his\r\npocket an object which he had discovered the day before beneath a hedge\r\nwhen gathering greenstuff for his rabbits.\r\n\r\n\"And this--will you have this?\" he said, handing me the object. \"Why,\r\ncertainly I will have it. Try to find me more, as many as you can, and\r\non Sunday you shall have lots of rides on the wooden horses. In the\r\nmeantime here is a penny for you. Don't forget it when you make up your\r\naccounts; don't mix it with your turnip-money; put it by itself.\"\r\nBeaming with satisfaction at such wealth, little touzle-head promised to\r\nsearch industriously, already foreseeing a fortune.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone I examined the thing. It was worth examination. It was\r\na fine cocoon, thick and with blunt ends, very like a silkworm's cocoon,\r\nfirm to the touch and of a tawny colour. A brief reference to the\r\ntext-books almost convinced me that this was a cocoon of the _Bombyx\r\nquercus_.[4] If so, what a find! I could continue my inquiry and perhaps\r\nconfirm what my study of the Great Peacock had made me suspect.\r\n\r\nThe Bombyx of the oak-tree is, in fact, a classic moth; indeed, there is\r\nno entomological text-book but speaks of its exploits at mating-time. It\r\nis said that a female emerged from the pupa in captivity, in the\r\ninterior of an apartment, and even in a closed box. It was far from the\r\ncountry, amidst the tumult of a large city. Nevertheless, the event was\r\nknown to those concerned in the woods and meadows. Guided by some\r\nmysterious compass, the males arrived, hastening from the distant\r\nfields; they went to the box, fluttered against it, and flew to and fro\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\nThese marvels I had learned by reading; but to see such a thing with\r\none's own eyes, and at the same time to devise experiments, is quite\r\nanother thing. What had my penny bargain in store for me? Would the\r\nfamous Bombyx issue from it?\r\n\r\nLet us call it by its other name, the Banded Monk. This original name of\r\nMonk was suggested by the costume of the male; a monk's robe of a modest\r\nrusty red. But in the case of the female the brown fustian gives place\r\nto a beautiful velvet, with a pale transversal band and little white\r\neyes on the fore pair of wings.\r\n\r\nThe Monk is not a common butterfly which can be caught by any one who\r\ntakes out a net at the proper season. I have never seen it around our\r\nvillage or in the solitude of my grounds during a residence of twenty\r\nyears. It is true that I am not a fervent butterfly-catcher; the dead\r\ninsect of the collector's cabinet has little interest for me; I must\r\nhave it living, in the exercise of its functions. But although I have\r\nnot the collector's zeal I have an attentive eye to all that flies or\r\ncrawls in the fields. A butterfly so remarkable for its size and\r\ncolouring would never have escaped my notice had I encountered it.\r\n\r\nThe little searcher whom I had enticed by a promise of rides upon wooden\r\nhorses never made a second find. For three years I requisitioned friends\r\nand neighbours, and especially their children, sharp-sighted snappers-up\r\nof trifles; I myself hunted often under heaps of withered leaves; I\r\ninspected stone-heaps and visited hollow tree-trunks. Useless pains; the\r\nprecious cocoon was not to be found. It is enough to say that the Banded\r\nMonk is extremely rare in my neighbourhood. The importance of this fact\r\nwill presently appear.\r\n\r\nAs I suspected, my cocoon was truly that of the celebrated Oak Eggar. On\r\nthe 20th of August a female emerged from it: corpulent, big-bellied,\r\ncoloured like the male, but lighter in hue. I placed her under the usual\r\nwire cover in the centre of my laboratory table, littered as it was with\r\nbooks, bottles, trays, boxes, test-tubes, and other apparatus. I have\r\nexplained the situation in speaking of the Great Peacock. Two windows\r\nlight the room, both opening on the garden. One was closed, the other\r\nopen day and night. The butterfly was placed in the shade, between the\r\nlines of the two windows, at a distance of 12 or 15 feet.\r\n\r\nThe rest of that day and the next went by without any occurrence worthy\r\nof notice. Hanging by the feet to the front of the wire cover, on the\r\nside nearest to the light, the prisoner was motionless, inert. There was\r\nno oscillation of the wings, no tremor of the antennæ, the female of the\r\nGreat Peacock behaved in a similar fashion.\r\n\r\nThe female Bombyx gradually matured, her tender tissues gradually\r\nbecoming firmer. By some process of which our scientists have not the\r\nleast idea she elaborated a mysterious lure which would bring her lovers\r\nfrom the four corners of the sky. What was happening in this big-bellied\r\nbody; what transmutations were accomplished, thus to affect the whole\r\ncountryside?\r\n\r\nOn the third day the bride was ready. The festival opened brilliantly. I\r\nwas in the garden, already despairing of success, for the days were\r\npassing and nothing had occurred, when towards three in the afternoon,\r\nthe weather being very hot and the sun radiant, I perceived a crowd of\r\nbutterflies gyrating in the embrasure of the open window.\r\n\r\nThe lovers had at last come to visit their lady. Some were emerging from\r\nthe room, others were entering it; others, clinging to the wall of the\r\nhouse, were resting as though exhausted by a long journey. I could see\r\nothers approaching in the distance, flying over the walls, over the\r\nscreens of cypress. They came from all directions, but at last with\r\ndecreasing frequency. I had missed the opening of the convocation, and\r\nnow the gathering was almost complete.\r\n\r\nI went indoors and upstairs. This time, in full daylight and without\r\nlosing a detail, I witnessed once more the astonishing spectacle to\r\nwhich the great nocturnal butterfly had first introduced me. The study\r\ncontained a cloud of males, which I estimated, at a glance, as being\r\nabout sixty in number, so far as the movement and confusion allowed me\r\nto count them at all. After circling a few times over the cage many of\r\nthem went to the open window, but returned immediately to recommence\r\ntheir evolutions. The most eager alighted on the cover, trampling on one\r\nanother, jostling one another, trying to get the best places. On the\r\nother side of the barrier the captive, her great body hanging against\r\nthe wire, waited immovable. She betrayed not a sign of emotion in the\r\nface of this turbulent swarm.\r\n\r\nGoing and entering, perched on the cover or fluttering round the room,\r\nfor more than three hours they continued their frenzied saraband. But\r\nthe sun was sinking, and the temperature was slowly falling. The ardour\r\nof the butterflies also cooled. Many went out not to return. Others took\r\nup their positions to wait for the gaieties of the following day; they\r\nclung to the cross-bars of the closed window as the males of the Great\r\nPeacock had done. The rejoicings were over for the day. They would\r\ncertainly be renewed on the morrow, since the courtship was without\r\nresult on account of the barrier of the wire-gauze cover.\r\n\r\nBut, alas I to my great disappointment, they were not resumed, and the\r\nfault was mine. Late in the day a Praying Mantis was brought to me,\r\nwhich merited attention on account of its exceptionally small size.\r\nPreoccupied with the events of the afternoon, and absent-minded, I\r\nhastily placed the predatory insect under the same cover as the moth.\r\nIt did not occur to me for a moment that this cohabitation could lead to\r\nany harm. The Mantis was so slender, and the other so corpulent!\r\n\r\nAlas! I little knew the fury of carnage animating the creature that\r\nwielded those tiny grappling-irons! Next morning I met with a\r\ndisagreeable surprise: I found the little Mantis devouring the great\r\nmoth. The head and the fore part of the thorax had already disappeared.\r\nHorrible creature! at what an evil hour you came to me! Goodbye to my\r\nresearches, the plans which I had caressed all night in my imagination!\r\nFor three years for lack of a subject, I was unable to resume them.\r\n\r\nBad luck, however, was not to make me forget the little I had learned.\r\nOn one single occasion about sixty males had arrived. Considering the\r\nrarity of the Oak Eggar, and remembering the years of fruitless search\r\non the part of my helpers and myself, this number was no less than\r\nstupefying. The undiscoverable had suddenly become multitudinous at the\r\ncall of the female.\r\n\r\nWhence did they come? From all sides, and undoubtedly from considerable\r\ndistances. During my prolonged searches every bush and thicket and heap\r\nof stones in my neighbourhood had become familiar to me, and I can\r\nassert that the Oak Eggar was not to be found there. For such a swarm to\r\ncollect as I found in my laboratory the moths must have come from all\r\ndirections, from the whole district, and within a radius that I dare not\r\nguess at.\r\n\r\nThree years went by and by chance two more cocoons of the Monk or Oak\r\nEggar again fell into my hands. Both produced females, at an interval of\r\na few days towards the middle of August; so that I was able to vary and\r\nrepeat my experiments.\r\n\r\nI rapidly repeated the experiments which had given me such positive\r\nresults in the instance of the Great Peacock moth. The pilgrims of the\r\nday were no less skilful at finding their mates than the pilgrims of the\r\nnight. They laughed at all my tricks. Infallibly they found the\r\nprisoners in their wire-gauze prisons, no matter in what part of the\r\nhouse they were placed; they discovered them in the depths of a\r\nwall-cupboard; they divined the secret of all manner of boxes, provided\r\nthese were not rigorously air-tight. They came no longer when the box\r\nwas hermetically sealed. So far this was only a repetition of the feats\r\nof the Great Peacock.\r\n\r\nA box perfectly closed, so that the air contained therein had no\r\ncommunication with the external atmosphere, left the male in complete\r\nignorance of the recluse. Not a single one arrived, even when the box\r\nwas exposed and plain to see on the window-sill. Thus the idea of\r\nstrongly scented effluvia, which are cut off by screens of wood, metal,\r\ncard, glass, or what not, returns with double force.\r\n\r\nI have shown that the great nocturnal moth was not thrown off the scent\r\nby the powerful odour of naphthaline, which I thought would mask the\r\nextra-subtle emanations of the female, which were imperceptible to human\r\nolfactory organs. I repeated the experiment with the Oak Eggar. This\r\ntime I used all the resources of scent and stench that my knowledge of\r\ndrugs would permit.\r\n\r\nA dozen saucers were arranged, some in the interior of the wire-gauze\r\ncover, the prison of the female, and some around it, in an unbroken\r\ncircle. Some contained naphthaline; others the essential oil of\r\nspike-lavender; others petroleum, and others a solution of alkaline\r\nsulphur giving off a stench of rotten eggs. Short of asphyxiating the\r\nprisoner I could do no more. These arrangements were made in the\r\nmorning, so that the room should be saturated when the congregation of\r\nlovers should arrive.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon the laboratory was filled with the most abominable\r\nstench, in which the penetrating aroma of spike-lavender and the stink\r\nof sulphuretted hydrogen were predominant. I must add that tobacco was\r\nhabitually smoked in this room, and in abundance. The concerted odours\r\nof a gas-works, a smoking-room, a perfumery, a petroleum well, and a\r\nchemical factory--would they succeed in confusing the male moths?\r\n\r\nBy no means. About three o'clock the moths arrived in as great numbers\r\nas usual. They went straight to the cage, which I had covered with a\r\nthick cloth in order to add to their difficulties. Seeing nothing when\r\nonce they had entered, and immersed in an extraordinary atmosphere in\r\nwhich any subtle fragrance should have been annihilated, they\r\nnevertheless made straight for the prisoner, and attempted to reach her\r\nby burrowing under the linen cloth. My artifice had no result.\r\n\r\nAfter this set-back, so obvious in its consequences, which only repeated\r\nthe lesson of the experiments made with naphthaline when my subject was\r\nthe Great Peacock, I ought logically to have abandoned the theory that\r\nthe moths are guided to their wedding festivities by means of strongly\r\nscented effluvia. That I did not do so was due to a fortuitous\r\nobservation. Chance often has a surprise in store which sets us on the\r\nright road when we have been seeking it in vain.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, while trying to determine whether sight plays any part in\r\nthe search for the female once the males had entered the room, I placed\r\nthe female in a bell-glass and gave her a slender twig of oak with\r\nwithered leaves as a support. The glass was set upon a table facing the\r\nopen window. Upon entering the room the moths could not fail to see the\r\nprisoner, as she stood directly in the way. The tray, containing a layer\r\nof sand, on which the female had passed the preceding day and night,\r\ncovered with a wire-gauze dish-cover, was in my way. Without\r\npremeditation I placed it at the other end of the room on the floor, in\r\na corner where there was but little light. It was a dozen yards away\r\nfrom the window.\r\n\r\nThe result of these preparations entirely upset my preconceived ideas.\r\nNone of the arrivals stopped at the bell-glass, where the female was\r\nplainly to be seen, the light falling full upon her prison. Not a\r\nglance, not an inquiry. They all flew to the further end of the room,\r\ninto the dark corner where I had placed the tray and the empty\r\ndish-cover.\r\n\r\nThey alighted on the wire dome, explored it persistently, beating their\r\nwings and jostling one another. All the afternoon, until sunset, the\r\nmoths danced about the empty cage the same saraband that the actual\r\npresence of the female had previously evoked. Finally they departed: not\r\nall, for there were some that would not go, held by some magical\r\nattractive force.\r\n\r\nTruly a strange result! The moths collected where there was apparently\r\nnothing to attract them, and remained there, unpersuaded by the sense of\r\nsight; they passed the bell-glass actually containing the female without\r\nhalting for a moment, although she must have been seen by many of the\r\nmoths both going and coming. Maddened by a lure, they paid no attention\r\nto the reality.\r\n\r\nWhat was the lure that so deceived them? All the preceding night and all\r\nthe morning the female had remained under the wire-gauze cover;\r\nsometimes clinging to the wire-work, sometimes resting on the sand in\r\nthe tray. Whatever she touched--above all, apparently, with her\r\ndistended abdomen--was impregnated, as a result of long contact, with a\r\ncertain emanation. This was her lure, her love-philtre; this it was that\r\nrevolutionised the Oak Eggar world. The sand retained it for some time\r\nand diffused the effluvium in turn.\r\n\r\nThey passed by the glass prison in which the female was then confined\r\nand hastened to the meshes of wire and the sand on which the magic\r\nphiltre had been poured; they crowded round the deserted chamber where\r\nnothing of the magician remained but the odorous testimony of her\r\nsojourn.\r\n\r\nThe irresistible philtre requires time for its elaboration. I conceive\r\nof it as an exhalation which is given off during courtship and gradually\r\nsaturates whatever is in contact with the motionless body of the female.\r\nIf the bell-glass was placed directly on the table, or, still better, on\r\na square of glass, the communication between the inside and the outside\r\nwas insufficient, and the males, perceiving no odour, did not arrive so\r\nlong as that condition of things obtained. It was plain that this\r\nfailure of transmission was not due to the action of the glass as a\r\nscreen simply, for if I established a free communication between the\r\ninterior of the bell-glass and the open air by supporting it on three\r\nsmall blocks, the moths did not collect round it at once, although there\r\nwere plenty in the room; but in the course of half an hour or so the\r\nfeminine alembic began to operate, and the visitors crowded round the\r\nbell-glass as usual.\r\n\r\nIn possession of these data and this unexpected enlightenment I varied\r\nthe experiments, but all pointed to the same conclusion. In the morning\r\nI established the female under the usual wire-gauze cover. For support I\r\ngave her a little twig of oak as before. There, motionless as if dead,\r\nshe crouched for hours, half buried in the dry leaves, which would thus\r\nbecome impregnated with her emanations.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour of the daily visits drew near I removed the twig, which\r\nwas by then thoroughly saturated with the emanations, and laid it on a\r\nchair not far from the open window. On the other hand I left the female\r\nunder the cover, plainly exposed on the table in the middle of the room.\r\n\r\nThe moths arrived as usual: first one, then two, then three, and\r\npresently five and six. They entered, flew out again, re-entered,\r\nmounted, descended, came and went, always in the neighbourhood of the\r\nwindow, not far from which was the chair on which the twig lay. None\r\nmade for the large table, on which, a few steps further from the window,\r\nthe female awaited them in the wire-gauze cover. They hesitated, that\r\nwas plain; they were still seeking.\r\n\r\nFinally they found. And what did they find? Simply the twig, which that\r\nmorning had served the ample matron as bed. Their wings rapidly\r\nfluttering, they alighted on the foliage; they explored it over and\r\nunder, probed it, raised it, and displaced it so that the twig finally\r\nfell to the floor. None the less they continued to probe between the\r\nleaves. Under the buffets and the draught of their wings and the\r\nclutches of their eager feet the little bundle of leaves ran along the\r\nfloor like a scrap of paper patted by the paws of a cat.\r\n\r\nWhile the twig was sliding away with its band of investigators two new\r\narrivals appeared. The chair lay in their path. They stopped at it and\r\nsearched eagerly at the very spot on which the twig had been lying. But\r\nwith these, as with the others, the real object of their desires was\r\nthere, close by, under a wire cover which was not even veiled. None took\r\nany note of it. On the floor, a handful of butterflies were still\r\nhustling the bunch of leaves on which the female had reposed that\r\nmorning; others, on the chair, were still examining the spot where the\r\ntwig had lain. The sun sank, and the hour of departure struck. Moreover,\r\nthe emanations were growing feebler, were evaporating. Without more ado\r\nthe visitors left. We bade them goodbye till the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe following tests showed me that the leaf-covered twig which\r\naccidentally enlightened me might be replaced by any other substance.\r\nSome time before the visitors were expected I placed the female on a bed\r\nof cloth or flannel, card or paper. I even subjected her to the rigours\r\nof a camp-bed of wood, glass, marble, and metal. All these objects,\r\nafter a contact of sufficient duration, had the same attraction for the\r\nmales as the female moth herself. They retained this property for a\r\nlonger or shorter time, according to their nature. Cardboard, flannel,\r\ndust, sand, and porous objects retained it longest. Metals, marble, and\r\nglass, on the contrary, quickly lost their efficacy. Finally, anything\r\non which the female had rested communicated its virtues by contact;\r\nwitness the butterflies crowding on the straw-bottomed chair after the\r\ntwig fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nUsing one of the most favourable materials--flannel, for example--I\r\nwitnessed a curious sight. I placed a morsel of flannel on which the\r\nmother moth had been lying all the morning at the bottom of a long\r\ntest-tube or narrow-necked bottle, just permitting of the passage of a\r\nmale moth. The visitors entered the vessels, struggled, and did not know\r\nhow to extricate themselves. I had devised a trap by means of which I\r\ncould exterminate the tribe. Delivering the prisoners, and removing the\r\nflannel, which I placed in a perfectly closed box, I found that they\r\nre-entered the trap; attracted by the effluvia that the flannel had\r\ncommunicated to the glass.\r\n\r\nI was now convinced. To call the moths of the countryside to the\r\nwedding-feast, to warn them at a distance and to guide them the nubile\r\nfemale emits an odour of extreme subtlety, imperceptible to our own\r\nolfactory sense-organs. Even with their noses touching the moth, none of\r\nmy household has been able to perceive the faintest odour; not even the\r\nyoungest, whose sensibility is as yet unvitiated.\r\n\r\nThis scent readily impregnates any object on which the female rests for\r\nany length of time, when this object becomes a centre of attraction as\r\nactive as the moth herself until the effluvium is evaporated.\r\n\r\nNothing visible betrays the lure. On a sheet of paper, a recent\r\nresting-place, around which the visitors had crowded, there was no\r\nvisible trace, no moisture; the surface was as clean as before the\r\nimpregnation.\r\n\r\nThe product is elaborated slowly, and must accumulate a little before it\r\nreveals its full power. Taken from her couch and placed elsewhere the\r\nfemale loses her attractiveness for the moment and is an object of\r\nindifference; it is to the resting-place, saturated by long contact,\r\nthat the arrivals fly. But the female soon regains her power.\r\n\r\nThe emission of the warning effluvium is more or less delayed according\r\nto the species. The recently metamorphosed female must mature a little\r\nand her organs must settle to their work. Born in the morning, the\r\nfemale of the Great Peacock moth sometimes has visitors the night of the\r\nsame day; but more often on the second day, after a preparation of forty\r\nhours or so. The Oak Eggar does not publish her banns of marriage before\r\nthe third or fourth day.\r\n\r\nLet us return for a moment to the problematical function of the antennæ.\r\nThe male Oak Eggar has a sumptuous pair, as has the Great Peacock or\r\nEmperor Moth. Are we to regard these silky \"feelers\" as a kind of\r\ndirecting compass?--I resumed, but without attaching much importance to\r\nthe matter, my previous experiment of amputation. None of those operated\r\non returned. Do not let us draw conclusions from that fact alone. We saw\r\nin the case of the Great Peacock that more serious reasons than the\r\ntruncation of the antennæ made return as a rule impossible.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a second Bombyx or Eggar, the Clover Moth, very like the Oak\r\nEggar, and like it superbly plumed, poses us a very difficult problem.\r\nIt is fairly abundant around my home; even in the orchard I find its\r\ncocoon, which is easily confounded with that of the Oak Eggar. I was at\r\nfirst deceived by the resemblance. From six cocoons, which I expected to\r\nyield Oak Eggars, I obtained, about the end of August, six females of\r\nthe other species. Well: about these six females, born in my house,\r\nnever a male appeared, although they were undoubtedly present in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\nIf the ample and feathery antennæ are truly sense-organs, which receive\r\ninformation of distant objects, why were not my richly plumed neighbours\r\naware of what was passing in my study? Why did their feathery \"feelers\"\r\nleave them in ignorance of events which would have brought flocks of the\r\nother Eggar? Once more, the organ does not determine the aptitude. One\r\nindividual or species is gifted, but another is not, despite an organic\r\nequality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nA TRUFFLE-HUNTER: THE _BOLBOCERAS GALLICUS_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the matter of physics we hear of nothing to-day but the Röntgen rays,\r\nwhich penetrate opaque bodies and photograph the invisible. A splendid\r\ndiscovery; but nothing very remarkable as compared with the surprises\r\nreserved for us by the future, when, better instructed as to the why and\r\nwherefore of things than now, and supplementing our feeble senses by\r\nmeans of science, we shall succeed in rivalling, however imperfectly,\r\nthe sensorial acuteness of the lower animals.\r\n\r\nHow enviable, in how many cases, is the superiority of the beasts! It\r\nmakes us realise the insufficiency of our impressions, and the very\r\nindifferent efficacy of our sense-organs; it proclaims realities which\r\namaze us, so far are they beyond our own attributes.\r\n\r\nA miserable caterpillar, the Processional caterpillar, found on the\r\npine-tree, has its back covered with meteorological spiracles which\r\nsense the coming weather and foretell the storm; the bird of prey, that\r\nincomparable watchman, sees the fallen mule from the heights of the\r\nclouds; the blind bats guided their flight without collision through the\r\ninextricable labyrinth of threads devised by Spallanzani; the carrier\r\npigeon, at a hundred leagues from home, infallibly regains its loft\r\nacross immensities which it has never known; and within the limits of\r\nits more modest powers a bee, the Chalicodoma, also adventures into the\r\nunknown, accomplishing its long journey and returning to its group of\r\ncells.\r\n\r\nThose who have never seen a dog seeking truffles have missed one of the\r\nfinest achievements of the olfactory sense. Absorbed in his duties, the\r\nanimal goes forward, scenting the wind, at a moderate pace. He stops,\r\nquestions the soil with his nostrils, and, without excitement, scratches\r\nthe earth a few times with one paw. \"There it is, master!\" his eyes seem\r\nto say: \"there it is! On the faith of a dog, there are truffles here!\"\r\n\r\nHe says truly. The master digs at the point indicated. If the spade goes\r\nastray the dog corrects the digger, sniffing at the bottom of the hole.\r\nHave no fear that stones and roots will confuse him; in spite of depth\r\nand obstacles, the truffle will be found. A dog's nose cannot lie.\r\n\r\nI have referred to the dog's speciality as a subtle sense of smell. That\r\nis certainly what I mean, if you will understand by that that the nasal\r\npassages of the animal are the seat of the perceptive organ; but is the\r\nthing perceived always a simple smell in the vulgar acceptation of the\r\nterm--an effluvium such as our own senses perceive? I have certain\r\nreasons for doubting this, which I will proceed to relate.\r\n\r\nOn various occasions I have had the good fortune to accompany a\r\ntruffle-dog of first-class capacities on his rounds. Certainly there was\r\nnot much outside show about him, this artist that I so desired to see at\r\nwork; a dog of doubtful breed, placid and meditative; uncouth,\r\nungroomed, and quite inadmissible to the intimacies of the hearthrug.\r\nTalent and poverty are often mated.\r\n\r\nHis master, a celebrated _rabassier_[5] of the village, being convinced\r\nthat my object was not to steal his professional secrets, and so sooner\r\nor later to set up in business as a competitor, admitted me of his\r\ncompany, a favour of which he was not prodigal. From the moment of his\r\nregarding me not as an apprentice, but merely as a curious spectator,\r\nwho drew and wrote about subterranean vegetable affairs, but had no wish\r\nto carry to market my bagful of these glories of the Christmas goose,\r\nthe excellent man lent himself generously to my designs.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed between us that the dog should act according to his own\r\ninstincts, receiving the customary reward, after each discovery, no\r\nmatter what its size, of a crust of bread the size of a finger-nail.\r\nEvery spot scratched by his paw should be excavated, and the object\r\nindicated was to be extracted without reference to its marketable value.\r\nIn no case was the experience of the master to intervene in order to\r\ndivert the dog from a spot where the general aspect of things indicated\r\nthat no commercial results need be expected, for I was more concerned\r\nwith the miserable specimens unfit for the market than with the choice\r\nspecimens, though of course the latter were welcomed.\r\n\r\nThus conducted, this subterranean botanising was extremely fruitful.\r\nWith that perspicacious nose of his the dog obtained for me both large\r\nand small, fresh and putrid, odorous and inodorous, fragrant and\r\noffensive. I was amazed at my collection, which comprised the greater\r\nnumber of the hypogenous fungi of the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nWhat a variety of structure, and above all of odour, the primordial\r\nquality in this question of scent! There were some that had no\r\nappreciable scent beyond a vague fungoid flavour, more or less common to\r\nall. Others smelt of turnips, of sour cabbage; some were fetid,\r\nsufficiently so to make the house of the collector noisome. Only the\r\ntrue truffle possessed the aroma dear to epicures. If odour, as we\r\nunderstand it, is the dog's only guide, how does he manage to follow\r\nthat guide amidst all these totally different odours? Is he warned of\r\nthe contents of the subsoil by a general emanation, by that fungoid\r\neffluvium common to all the species? Thus a somewhat embarrassing\r\nquestion arises.\r\n\r\nI paid special attention to the ordinary toadstools and mushrooms, which\r\nannounced their near advent by cracking the surface of the soil. Now\r\nthese points, where my eyes divined the cryptogam pushing back the soil\r\nwith its button-like heads, these points, where the ordinary fungoid\r\nodour was certainly very pronounced, were never selected by the dog. He\r\npassed them disdainfully, without a sniff, without a stroke of the paw.\r\nYet the fungi were underground, and their odour was similar to that I\r\nhave already referred to.\r\n\r\nI came back from my outings with the conviction that the truffle-finding\r\nnose has some better guide than odour such as we with our sense-organs\r\nconceive it. It must perceive effluvia of another order as well;\r\nentirely mysterious to us, and therefore not utilised. Light has its\r\ndark rays--rays without effect upon our retinas, but not apparently on\r\nall. Why should not the domain of smell have its secret emanations,\r\nunknown to our senses and perceptible to a different sense-organ?\r\n\r\nIf the scent of the dog leaves us perplexed in the sense that we cannot\r\npossibly say precisely, cannot even suspect what it is that the dog\r\nperceives, at least it is clear that it would be erroneous to refer\r\neverything to human standards. The world of sensations is far larger\r\nthan the limits of our own sensibility. What numbers of facts relating\r\nto the interplay of natural forces must escape us for want of\r\nsufficiently sensitive organs!\r\n\r\nThe unknown--that inexhaustible field in which the men of the future\r\nwill try their strength--has harvests in store for us beside which our\r\npresent knowledge would show as no more than a wretched gleaning. Under\r\nthe sickle of science will one day fall the sheaves whose grain would\r\nappear to-day as senseless paradoxes. Scientific dreams? No, if you\r\nplease, but undeniable positive realities, affirmed by the brute\r\ncreation, which in certain respects has so great an advantage over us.\r\n\r\nDespite his long practice of his calling, despite the scent of the\r\nobject he was seeking, the _rabassier_ could not divine the presence of\r\nthe truffle, which ripens in winter under the soil, at a depth of a foot\r\nor two; he must have the help of a dog or a pig, whose scent is able to\r\ndiscover the secrets of the soil. These secrets are known to various\r\ninsects even better than to our two auxiliaries. They have in\r\nexceptional perfection the power of discovering the tubers on which\r\ntheir larvæ are nourished.\r\n\r\nFrom truffles dug up in a spoiled condition, peopled with vermin, and\r\nplaced in that condition, with a bed of fresh sand, in a glass jar, I\r\nhave in the past obtained a small red beetle, known as the\r\ntruffle-beetle (_Anisotoma cinnamomea_, Panz.), and various Diptera,\r\namong which is a Sapromyzon which, by its sluggish flight and its\r\nfragile form, recalls the _Scatophaga scybalaria_, the yellow velvety\r\nfly which is found in human excrement in the autumn. The latter finds\r\nits refuge on the surface of the soil, at the foot of a wall or hedge or\r\nunder a bush; but how does the former know just where the truffle lies\r\nunder the soil, or at what depth? To penetrate to that depth, or to seek\r\nin the subsoil, is impossible. Its fragile limbs, barely able to move a\r\ngrain of sand, its extended wings, which would bar all progress in a\r\nnarrow passage, and its costume of bristling silken pile, which would\r\nprevent it from slipping through crevices, all make such a task\r\nimpossible. The Sapromyzon is forced to lay its eggs on the surface of\r\nthe soil, but it does so on the precise spot which overlies the truffle,\r\nfor the grubs would perish if they had to wander at random in search of\r\ntheir provender, the truffle being always thinly sown.\r\n\r\nThe truffle fly is informed by the sense of smell of the points\r\nfavourable to its maternal plans; it has the talents of the truffle-dog,\r\nand doubtless in a higher degree, for it knows naturally, without having\r\nbeen taught, what its rival only acquires through an artificial\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nIt would be not uninteresting to follow the Sapromyzon in its search in\r\nthe open woods. Such a feat did not strike me as particularly possible;\r\nthe insect is rare, flies off quickly when alarmed, and is lost to\r\nview. To observe it closely under such conditions would mean a loss of\r\ntime and an assiduity of which I do not feel capable. Another\r\ntruffle-hunter will show us what we could hardly learn from the fly.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty little black beetle, with a pale, velvety abdomen; a\r\nspherical insect, as large as a biggish cherry-stone. Its official title\r\nis _Bolboceras gallicus_, Muls. By rubbing the end of the abdomen\r\nagainst the edge of the wing-cases it produces a gentle chirping sound\r\nlike the cheeping of nestlings when the mother-bird returns to the nest\r\nwith food. The male wears a graceful horn on his head; a duplicate, in\r\nlittle, of that of the _Copris hispanus_.\r\n\r\nDeceived by this horn, I at first took the insect for a member of the\r\ncorporation of dung-beetles, and as such I reared it in captivity. I\r\noffered it the kind of diet most appreciated by its supposed relatives,\r\nbut never, never would it touch such food. For whom did I take it? Fie\r\nupon me! To offer ordure to an epicure! It required, if not precisely\r\nthe truffle known to our _chefs_ and _gourmets_, at least its\r\nequivalent.\r\n\r\nThis characteristic I grasped only after patient investigation. At the\r\nsouthern foot of the hills of Sérignan, not far from the village, is a\r\nwood of maritime pines alternating with rows of cypress. There, towards\r\nToussaint, after the autumnal rains, you may find an abundance of the\r\nmushrooms or \"toadstools\" that affect the conifers; especially the\r\ndelicious Lactaris, which turns green if the points are rubbed and drips\r\nblood if broken. In the warm days of autumn this is the favourite\r\npromenade of the members of my household, being distant enough to\r\nexercise their young legs, but near enough not to fatigue them.\r\n\r\nThere one finds and sees all manner of things: old magpies' nests, great\r\nbundles of twigs; jays, wrangling after filling their crops with the\r\nacorns of the neighbouring oaks; rabbits, whose little white upturned\r\nscuts go bobbing away through the rosemary bushes; dung-beetles, which\r\nare storing food for the winter and throwing up their rubbish on the\r\nthreshold of their burrows. And then the fine sand, soft to the touch,\r\neasily tunnelled, easily excavated or built into tiny huts which we\r\nthatch with moss and surmount with the end of a reed for a chimney; and\r\nthe delicious meal of apples, and the sound of the æolian harps which\r\nsoftly whisper among the boughs of the pines!\r\n\r\nFor the children it is a real paradise, where they can receive the\r\nreward of well-learned lessons. The grown-ups also can share in the\r\nenjoyment. As for myself, for long years I have watched two insects\r\nwhich are found there without getting to the bottom of their domestic\r\nsecrets. One is the _Minotaurus typhæus_, whose male carries on his\r\ncorselet three spines which point forward. The old writers called him\r\nthe Phalangist, on account of his armour, which is comparable to the\r\nthree ranks of lances of the Macedonian phalanx.\r\n\r\nThis is a robust creature, heedless of the winter. All during the cold\r\nseason, whenever the weather relents a little, it issues discreetly from\r\nits lodging, at nightfall, and gathers, in the immediate neighbourhood\r\nof its dwelling, a few fragments of sheep-dung and ancient olives which\r\nthe summer suns have dried. It stacks them in a row at the end of its\r\nburrow, closes the door, and consumes them. When the food is broken up\r\nand exhausted of its meagre juices it returns to the surface and renews\r\nits store. Thus the winter passes, famine being unknown unless the\r\nweather is exceptionally hard.\r\n\r\nThe second insect which I have observed for so long among the pines is\r\nthe Bolboceras. Its burrows, scattered here and there, higgledy-piggledy\r\nwith those of the Minotaur, are easy to recognise. The burrow of the\r\nPhalangist is surmounted by a voluminous rubbish-dump, the materials of\r\nwhich are piled in the form of a cylinder as long as the finger. Each of\r\nthese dumps is a load of refuse and rubbish pushed outward by the little\r\nsapper, which shoulders it up from below. The orifice is closed whenever\r\nthe insect is at home, enlarging its tunnel or peacefully enjoying the\r\ncontents of its larder.\r\n\r\nThe lodging of the Bolboceras is open and surrounded simply by a mound\r\nof sand. Its depth is not great; a foot or hardly more. It descends\r\nvertically in an easily shifted soil. It is therefore easy to inspect\r\nit, if we take care first of all to dig a trench so that the wall of the\r\nburrow may be afterwards cut away, slice by slice, with the blade of a\r\nknife. The burrow is thus laid bare along its whole extent, from the\r\nsurface to the bottom, until nothing remains of it but a\r\ndemi-cylindrical groove.\r\n\r\nOften the violated dwelling is empty. The insect has departed in the\r\nnight, having finished its business there. It is a nomad, a\r\nnight-walker, which leaves its dwelling without regret and easily\r\nacquires another. Often, on the other hand, the insect will be found at\r\nthe bottom of the burrow; sometimes a male, sometimes a female, but\r\nalways alone. The two sexes, equally zealous in excavating their\r\nburrows, work apart without collaboration. This is no family mansion for\r\nthe rearing of offspring; it is a temporary dwelling, made by each\r\ninsect for its own benefit.\r\n\r\nSometimes the burrow contains nothing but the well-sinker surprised at\r\nits work: sometimes--and not rarely--the hermit will be found embracing\r\na small subterranean fungus, entire or partly consumed. It presses it\r\nconvulsively to its bosom and will not be parted from it. This is the\r\ninsect's booty: its worldly wealth. Scattered crumbs inform us that we\r\nhave surprised the beetle at a feast.\r\n\r\nLet us deprive the insect of its booty. We find a sort of irregular,\r\nrugged, purse-like object, varying in size from the largeness of a pea\r\nto that of a cherry. The exterior is reddish, covered with fine warts,\r\nhaving an appearance not unlike shagreen; the interior, which has no\r\ncommunication with the exterior, is smooth and white. The pores, ovoidal\r\nand diaphanous, are contained, in groups of eight, in long capsules.\r\nFrom these characteristics we recognise an underground cryptogam, known\r\nto the botanists as _Hydnocystis arenaria_, and a relation of the\r\ntruffle.\r\n\r\nThis discovery begins to throw a light on the habits of the Bolboceras\r\nand the cause of its burrows, so frequently renewed. In the calm of the\r\ntwilight the little truffle-hunter goes abroad, chirping softly to\r\nencourage itself. It explores the soil, and interrogates it as to its\r\ncontents, exactly as does the truffle-gatherer's dog. The sense of smell\r\nwarns it that the desired object is beneath it, covered by a few inches\r\nof sand. Certain of the precise point where the treasure lies, it sinks\r\na well vertically downwards, and infallibly reaches it. So long as there\r\nis food left it does not again leave the burrow. It feasts happily at\r\nthe bottom of its well, heedless of the open or imperfectly closed\r\nburrow.\r\n\r\nWhen no more food is left it removes in search of further booty, which\r\nbecomes the occasion of another burrow, this too in its turn to be\r\nabandoned. So many truffles eaten necessitate so many burrows, which are\r\nmere dining-rooms or pilgrim's larders. Thus pass the autumn and the\r\nspring, the seasons of the _Hydnocystis_, in the pleasures of the table\r\nand removal from one house to another.\r\n\r\nTo study the insect _rabassier_ in my own house I had to obtain a small\r\nstore of its favourite food. To seek it myself, by digging at random,\r\nwould have resulted merely in waste of time; the little cryptogam is not\r\nso common that I could hope to find it without a guide. The\r\ntruffle-hunter must have his dog; my guide should be the Bolboceras\r\nitself. Behold me, then, a _rabassier_ of a kind hitherto unknown. I\r\nhave told my secret, although I fear my original teacher will laugh at\r\nme if he ever hears of my singular form of competition.\r\n\r\nThe subterranean fungi grow only at certain points, but they are often\r\nfound in groups. Now, the beetle has passed this way; with its subtle\r\nsense of smell it has recognised the ground as favourable; for its\r\nburrows are numerous. Let us dig, then, in the neighbourhood of these\r\nholes. The sign is reliable; in a few hours, thanks to the signs of the\r\nBolboceras, I obtain a handful of specimens of the _Hydnocystis_. It is\r\nthe first time I have ever found this fungus in the ground. Let us now\r\ncapture the insect--an easy matter, for we have only to excavate the\r\nburrows.\r\n\r\nThe same evening I begin my experiments. A wide earthen pan is filled\r\nwith fresh sand which has been passed through a sieve. With the aid of a\r\nstick the thickness of a finger I make six vertical holes in the sand:\r\nthey are conveniently far apart, and are eight inches in depth. A\r\n_Hydnocystis_ is placed at the bottom of each; a fine straw is then\r\ninserted, to show me the precise position later. Finally the six holes\r\nare filled with sand which is beaten down so that all is firm. When the\r\nsurface is perfectly level, and everywhere the same, except for the six\r\nstraws, which mean nothing to the insect, I release my beetles, covering\r\nthem with a wire-gauze cover. They are eight in number.\r\n\r\nAt first I see nothing but the inevitable fatigue due to the incidents\r\nof exhumation, transport, and confinement in a strange place. My exiles\r\ntry to escape: they climb the wire walls, and finally all take to earth\r\nat the edge of their enclosure. Night comes, and all is quiet. Two hours\r\nlater I pay my prisoners a last visit. Three are still buried under a\r\nthin layer of sand. The other five have sunk each a vertical well at the\r\nvery foot of the straws which indicate the position of the buried fungi.\r\nNext morning the sixth straw has its burrow like the rest.\r\n\r\nIt is time to see what is happening underground. The sand is\r\nmethodically removed in vertical slices. At the bottom of each burrow is\r\na Bolboceras engaged in eating its truffle.\r\n\r\nLet us repeat the experiment with the partly eaten fungi. The result is\r\nthe same. In one short night the food is divined under its covering of\r\nsand and attained by means of a burrow which descends as straight as a\r\nplumb-line to the point where the fungus lies. There has been no\r\nhesitation, no trial excavations which have nearly discovered the object\r\nof search. This is proved by the surface of the soil, which is\r\neverywhere just as I left it when smoothing it down. The insect could\r\nnot make more directly for the objective if guided by the sense of\r\nsight; it digs always at the foot of the straw, my private sign. The\r\ntruffle-dog, sniffing the ground in search of truffles, hardly attains\r\nthis degree of precision.\r\n\r\nDoes the _Hydnocystis_ possess a very keen odour, such as we should\r\nexpect to give an unmistakable warning to the senses of the consumer? By\r\nno means. To our own sense of smell it is a neutral sort of object, with\r\nno appreciable scent whatever. A little pebble taken from the soil would\r\naffect our senses quite as strongly with its vague savour of fresh\r\nearth. As a finder of underground fungi the Bolboceras is the rival of\r\nthe dog. It would be the superior of the dog if it could generalise; it\r\nis, however, a rigid specialist, recognising nothing but the\r\n_Hydnocystis_. No other fungus, to my knowledge, either attracts it or\r\ninduces it to dig.[6]\r\n\r\nBoth dog and beetle are very near the subsoil which they scrutinise; the\r\nobject they seek is at no great depth. At a greater depth neither dog\r\nnor insect could perceive such subtle effluvia, nor even the odour of\r\nthe truffle. To attract insect or animal at a great distance powerful\r\nodours are necessary, such as our grosser senses can perceive. Then the\r\nexploiters of the odorous substance hasten from afar off and from all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nIf for purposes of study I require specimens of such insects as dissect\r\ndead bodies I expose a dead mole to the sunlight in a distant corner of\r\nmy orchard. As soon as the creature is swollen with the gases of\r\nputrefaction, and the fur commences to fall from the greenish skin, a\r\nhost of insects arrive--Silphidæ, Dermestes, Horn-beetles, and\r\nNecrophori--of which not a single specimen could ever be obtained in my\r\ngarden or even in the neighbourhood without the use of such a bait.\r\n\r\nThey have been warned by the sense of smell, although far away in all\r\ndirections, while I myself can escape from the stench by recoiling a few\r\npaces. In comparison with their sense of smell mine is miserable; but in\r\nthis case, both for me and for them, there is really what our language\r\ncalls an odour.\r\n\r\nI can do still better with the flower of the Serpent Arum (_Arum\r\ndracunculus_), so noteworthy both for its form and its incomparable\r\nstench. Imagine a wide lanceolated blade of a vinous purple, some twenty\r\ninches in length, which is twisted at the base into an ovoid purse about\r\nthe size of a hen's egg. Through the opening of this capsule rises the\r\ncentral column, a long club of a livid green, surrounded at the base by\r\ntwo rings, one of ovaries and the other of stamens. Such, briefly, is\r\nthe flower or rather the inflorescence of the Serpent Arum.\r\n\r\nFor two days it exhales a horrible stench of putrid flesh; a dead dog\r\ncould not produce such a terrible odour. Set free by the sun and the\r\nwind, it is odious, intolerable. Let us brave the infected atmosphere\r\nand approach; we shall witness a curious spectacle.\r\n\r\nWarned by the stench, which travels far and wide, a host of insects are\r\nflying hither; such insects as dissect the corpses of frogs, adders,\r\nlizards, hedgehogs, moles and field-mice--creatures that the peasant\r\nfinds beneath his spade and throws disembowelled on the path. They fall\r\nupon the great leaf, whose livid purple gives it the appearance of a\r\nstrip of putrid flesh; they dance with impatience, intoxicated by the\r\ncorpse-like odour which to them is so delicious; they roll down its\r\nsteep face and are engulfed in the capsule. After a few hours of hot\r\nsunlight the receptacle is full.\r\n\r\nLet us look into the capsule through the narrow opening. Nowhere else\r\ncould you see such a mob of insects. It is a delirious mixture of backs\r\nand bellies, wing-covers and legs, which swarms and rolls upon itself,\r\nrising and falling, seething and boiling, shaken by continual\r\nconvulsions, clicking and squeaking with a sound of entangled\r\narticulations. It is a bacchanal, a general access of delirium tremens.\r\n\r\nA few, but only a few, emerge from the mass. By the central mast or the\r\nwalls of the purse they climb to the opening. Do they wish to take\r\nflight and escape? By no means. On the threshold of the cavity, while\r\nalready almost at liberty, they allow themselves to fall into the\r\nwhirlpool, retaken by their madness. The lure is irresistible. None will\r\nbreak free from the swarm until the evening, or perhaps the next day,\r\nwhen the heady fumes will have evaporated. Then the units of the swarm\r\ndisengage themselves from their mutual embraces, and slowly, as though\r\nregretfully, take flight and depart. At the bottom of this devil's purse\r\nremains a heap of the dead and dying, of severed limbs and wing-covers\r\ntorn off; the inevitable sequels of the frantic orgy. Soon the woodlice,\r\nearwigs, and ants will appear to prey upon the injured.\r\n\r\nWhat are these insects doing? Were they the prisoners of the flower,\r\nconverted into a trap which allowed them to enter but prevented their\r\nescape by means of a palisade of converging hairs? No, they were not\r\nprisoners; they had full liberty to escape, as is proved by the final\r\nexodus, which is in no way impeded. Deceived by a fallacious odour, were\r\nthey endeavouring to lay and establish their eggs as they would have\r\ndone under the shelter of a corpse? No; there is no trace of eggs in the\r\npurse of the Arum. They came convoked by the odour of a decaying body,\r\ntheir supreme delight; an intoxication seized them, and they rushed into\r\nthe eddying swarm to take part in a festival of carrion-eaters.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to count the number of those attracted. At the height of\r\nthe bacchanal I emptied the purse into a bottle. Intoxicated as they\r\nwere, many would escape my census, and I wished to ensure its accuracy.\r\nA few drops of carbon bisulphide quieted the swarm. The census proved\r\nthat there were more than four hundred insects in the purse of the Arum.\r\nThe collection consisted entirely of two species--Dermestes and\r\nSaprinidæ--both eager prospectors of carrion and animal detritus during\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\nMy friend Bull, an honest dog all his lifetime if ever there was one,\r\namongst other eccentricities had the following: finding in the dust of\r\nthe road the shrivelled body of a mole, flattened by the feet of\r\npedestrians, mummified by the heat of the sun, he would slide himself\r\nover it, from the tip of his nose to the root of his tail, he would rub\r\nhimself against it deliciously over and over again, shaken with nervous\r\nspasms, and roll upon it first in one direction, then in the other.\r\n\r\nIt was his sachet of musk, his flask of eau-de-Cologne. Perfumed to his\r\nliking, he would rise, shake himself, and proceed on his way, delighted\r\nwith his toilet. Do not let us scold him, and above all do not let us\r\ndiscuss the matter. There are all kinds of tastes in a world.\r\n\r\nWhy should there not be insects with similar habits among the amateurs\r\nof corpse-like savours? We see Dermestes and Saprinidæ hastening to the\r\narum-flower. All day long they writhe and wriggle in a swarm, although\r\nperfectly free to escape; numbers perish in the tumultuous orgy. They\r\nare not retained by the desire of food, for the arum provides them with\r\nnothing eatable; they do not come to breed, for they take care not to\r\nestablish their grubs in that place of famine. What are these frenzied\r\ncreatures doing? Apparently they are intoxicated with fetidity, as was\r\nBull when he rolled on the putrid body of a mole.\r\n\r\nThis intoxication draws them from all parts of the neighbourhood,\r\nperhaps over considerable distances; how far we do not know. The\r\nNecrophori, in quest of a place where to establish their family, travel\r\ngreat distances to find the corpses of small animals, informed by such\r\nodours as offend our own senses at a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nThe _Hydnocystis_, the food of the Bolboceras, emits no such brutal\r\nemanations as these, which readily diffuse themselves through space; it\r\nis inodorous, at least to our senses. The insect which seeks it does not\r\ncome from a distance; it inhabits the places wherein the cryptogam is\r\nfound. Faint as are the effluvia of this subterranean fungus, the\r\nprospecting epicure, being specially equipped, perceives them with the\r\ngreatest ease; but then he operates at close range, from the surface of\r\nthe soil. The truffle-dog is in the same case; he searches with his nose\r\nto the ground. The true truffle, however, the essential object of his\r\nsearch, possesses a fairly vivid odour.\r\n\r\nBut what are we to say of the Great Peacock moth and the Oak Eggar, both\r\nof which find their captive female? They come from the confines of the\r\nhorizon. What do they perceive at that distance? Is it really an odour\r\nsuch as we perceive and understand? I cannot bring myself to believe it.\r\n\r\nThe dog finds the truffle by smelling the earth quite close to the\r\ntuber; but he finds his master at great distances by following his\r\nfootsteps, which he recognises by their scent. Yet can he find the\r\ntruffle at a hundred yards? or his master, in the complete absence of a\r\ntrail? No. With all his fineness of scent, the dog is incapable of such\r\nfeats as are realised by the moth, which is embarrassed neither by\r\ndistance nor the absence of a trail.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that odour, such as affects our olfactory sense, consists\r\nof molecules emanating from the body whose odour is perceived. The\r\nodorous material becomes diffused through the air to which it\r\ncommunicates its agreeable or disagreeable aroma. Odour and taste are to\r\na certain extent the same; in both there is contact between the material\r\nparticles causing the impression and the sensitive papillæ affected by\r\nthe impression.\r\n\r\nThat the Serpent Arum should elaborate a powerful essence which\r\nimpregnates the atmosphere and makes it noisome is perfectly simple and\r\ncomprehensible. Thus the Dermestes and Saprinidæ, those lovers of\r\ncorpse-like odours, are warned by molecular diffusion. In the same way\r\nthe putrid frog emits and disseminates around it atoms of putrescence\r\nwhich travel to a considerable distance and so attract and delight the\r\nNecrophorus, the carrion-beetle.\r\n\r\nBut in the case of the Great Peacock or the Oak Eggar, what molecules\r\nare actually disengaged? None, according to our sense of smell. And yet\r\nthis lure, to which the males hasten so speedily, must saturate with its\r\nmolecules an enormous hemisphere of air--a hemisphere some miles in\r\ndiameter! What the atrocious fetor of the Arum cannot do the absence of\r\nodour accomplishes! However divisible matter may be, the mind refuses\r\nsuch conclusions. It would be to redden a lake with a grain of carmine;\r\nto fill space with a mere nothing.\r\n\r\nMoreover, where my laboratory was previously saturated with powerful\r\nodours which should have overcome and annihilated any particularly\r\ndelicate effluvium, the male moths arrived without the least indication\r\nof confusion or delay.\r\n\r\nA loud noise stifles a feeble note and prevents it from being heard; a\r\nbrilliant light eclipses a feeble glimmer. Heavy waves overcome and\r\nobliterate ripples. In the two cases cited we have waves of the same\r\nnature. But a clap of thunder does not diminish the feeblest jet of\r\nlight; the dazzling glory of the sun will not muffle the slightest\r\nsound. Of different natures, light and sound do not mutually interact.\r\n\r\nMy experiment with spike-lavender, naphthaline, and other odours seems\r\nto prove that odour proceeds from two sources. For emission substitute\r\nundulation, and the problem of the Great Peacock moth is explained.\r\nWithout any material emanation a luminous point shakes the ether with\r\nits vibrations and fills with light a sphere of indefinite magnitude.\r\nSo, or in some such manner, must the warning effluvium of the mother Oak\r\nEggar operate. The moth does not emit molecules; but something about it\r\nvibrates, causing waves capable of propagation to distances incompatible\r\nwith an actual diffusion of matter.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view, smell would have two domains--that of particles\r\ndissolved in the air and that of etheric waves.[7] The former domain\r\nalone is known to us. It is also known to the insect. It is this that\r\nwarns the Saprinidæ of the fetid arum, the Silphidæ and the Necrophori\r\nof the putrid mole.\r\n\r\nThe second category of odour, far superior in its action through space,\r\nescapes us completely, because we lack the essential sensory equipment.\r\nThe Great Peacock moth and the Oak Eggar know it at the time of their\r\nnuptial festivities. Many others must share it in differing degrees,\r\naccording to the exigencies of their way of life.\r\n\r\nLike light, odour has its X-rays. Let science, instructed by the insect,\r\none day give us a radiograph sensitive to odours, and this artificial\r\nnose will open a new world of marvels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT-BEETLE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of our machines have extraordinary-looking mechanisms, which remain\r\ninexplicable so long as they are seen in repose. But wait until the\r\nwhole is in motion; then the uncouth-looking contrivance, with its\r\ncog-wheels interacting and its connecting-rods oscillating, will reveal\r\nthe ingenious combination in which all things are skilfully disposed to\r\nproduce the desired effects. It is the same with certain insects; with\r\ncertain weevils, for instance, and notably with the Acorn-beetles or\r\nBalanini, which are adapted, as their name denotes, to the exploitation\r\nof acorns, nuts, and other similar fruits.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable, in my part of France, is the Acorn Elephant\r\n(_Balaninus elephas_, Sch.). It is well named; the very name evokes a\r\nmental picture of the insect. It is a living caricature, this beetle\r\nwith the prodigious snout. The latter is no thicker than a horsehair,\r\nreddish in colour, almost rectilinear, and of such length that in order\r\nnot to stumble the insect is forced to carry it stiffly outstretched\r\nlike a lance in rest. What is the use of this embarrassing pike, this\r\nridiculous snout?\r\n\r\nHere I can see some reader shrug his shoulders. Well, if the only end of\r\nlife is to make money by hook or by crook, such questions are certainly\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nHappily there are some to whom nothing in the majestic riddle of the\r\nuniverse is little. They know of what humble materials the bread of\r\nthought is kneaded; a nutriment no less necessary than the bread made\r\nfrom wheat; and they know that both labourers and inquirers nourish the\r\nworld with an accumulation of crumbs.\r\n\r\nLet us take pity on the question, and proceed. Without seeing it at\r\nwork, we already suspect that the fantastic beak of the Balaninus is a\r\ndrill analogous to those which we ourselves use in order to perforate\r\nhard materials. Two diamond-points, the mandibles, form the terminal\r\narmature of the drill. Like the Larinidæ, but under conditions of\r\ngreater difficulty, the Curculionidæ must use the implement in order to\r\nprepare the way for the installation of their eggs.\r\n\r\nBut however well founded our suspicion may be, it is not a certitude. I\r\ncan only discover the secret by watching the insect at work.\r\n\r\nChance, the servant of those that patiently solicit it, grants me a\r\nsight of the acorn-beetle at work, in the earlier half of October. My\r\nsurprise is great, for at this late season all industrial activity is as\r\na rule at an end. The first touch of cold and the entomological season\r\nis over.\r\n\r\nTo-day, moreover, it is wild weather; the _bise_ is moaning, glacial,\r\ncracking one's lips. One needs a robust faith to go out on such a day in\r\norder to inspect the thickets. Yet if the beetle with the long beak\r\nexploits the acorns, as I think it does, the time presses if I am to\r\ncatch it at its work. The acorns, still green, have acquired their full\r\ngrowth. In two or three weeks they will attain the chestnut brown of\r\nperfect maturity, quickly followed by their fall.\r\n\r\nMy seemingly futile pilgrimage ends in success. On the evergreen oaks I\r\nsurprise a Balaninus with the trunk half sunk in an acorn. Careful\r\nobservation is impossible while the branches are shaken by the\r\n_mistral_. I detach the twig and lay it gently upon the ground. The\r\ninsect takes no notice of its removal; it continues its work. I crouch\r\nbeside it, sheltered from the storm behind a mass of underwood, and\r\nwatch operations.\r\n\r\nShod with adhesive sandals which later on, in my laboratory, will allow\r\nit rapidly to climb a vertical sheet of glass, the elephant-beetle is\r\nsolidly established on the smooth, steep curvature of the acorn. It is\r\nworking its drill. Slowly and awkwardly it moves around its implanted\r\nweapon, describing a semicircle whose centre is the point of the drill,\r\nand then another semicircle in the reverse direction. This is repeated\r\nover and over again; the movement, in short, is identical with that we\r\ngive to a bradawl when boring a hole in a plank.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the rostrum sinks into the acorn. At the end of an hour\r\nit has entirely disappeared. A short period of repose follows, and\r\nfinally the instrument is withdrawn. What is going to happen next?\r\nNothing on this occasion. The Balaninus abandons its work and solemnly\r\nretires, disappearing among the withered leaves. For the day there is\r\nnothing more to be learned.\r\n\r\nBut my interest is now awakened. On calm days, more favourable to the\r\nentomologist, I return to the woods, and I soon have sufficient insects\r\nto people my laboratory cages. Foreseeing a serious difficulty in the\r\nslowness with which the beetle labours, I prefer to study them indoors,\r\nwith the unlimited leisure only to be found in one's own home.\r\n\r\nThe precaution is fortunate. If I had tried to continue as I began, and\r\nto observe the Balaninus in the liberty of the woods, I should never,\r\neven with the greatest good fortune, have had the patience to follow to\r\nthe end the choice of the acorn, the boring of the hole, and the laying\r\nof the eggs, so meticulously deliberate is the insect in all its\r\naffairs; as the reader will soon be able to judge.\r\n\r\nThree species of oak-tree compose the copse inhabited by the Balaninus:\r\nthe evergreen oak and the pubescent oak, which would become fine trees\r\nif the woodman would give them time, and the kermes oak, a mere scrubby\r\nbush. The first species, which is the most abundant of the three, is\r\nthat preferred by the Balaninus. The acorn is firm, elongated, and of\r\nmoderate size; the cup is covered with little warts. The acorns of the\r\npubescent oak are usually stunted, short, wrinkled, and fluted, and\r\nsubject to premature fall. The aridity of the hills of Sérignan is\r\nunfavourable to them. The Acorn-beetles accept them only in default of\r\nsomething better.\r\n\r\nThe kermes, a dwarf oak, a ridiculous tree which a man can jump over,\r\nsurprises me by the wealth of its acorns, which are large, ovoidal\r\ngrowths, the cup being covered with scales. The Balaninus could not make\r\na better choice; the acorn affords a safe, strong dwelling and a\r\ncapacious storehouse of food.\r\n\r\nA few twigs from these three trees, well provided with acorns, are\r\narranged under the domes of some of my wire-gauze covers, the ends being\r\nplunged into a glass of water which will keep them fresh. A suitable\r\nnumber of couples are then introduced into the cages; and the latter are\r\nplaced at the windows of my study, where they obtain the direct sunlight\r\nfor the greater part of the day. Let us now arm ourselves with patience,\r\nand keep a constant watch upon events. We shall be rewarded; the\r\nexploitation of the acorn deserves to be seen.\r\n\r\nMatters do not drag on for very long. Two days after these preparations\r\nI arrive at the precise moment when the task is commenced. The mother,\r\nlarger than the male, and equipped with a longer drill, is inspecting\r\nher acorn, doubtless with a view to depositing her eggs.\r\n\r\nShe goes over it step by step, from the point to the stem, both above\r\nand below. On the warty cup progression is easy; over the rest of the\r\nsurface it would be impossible, were not the soles of her feet shod with\r\nadhesive pads, which enable her to retain her hold in any position.\r\nWithout the least uncertainty of footing, the insect walks with equal\r\nfacility over the top or bottom or up the sides of the slippery fruit.\r\n\r\nThe choice is made; the acorn is recognised as being of good quality.\r\nThe time has come to sink the hole. On account of its excessive length\r\nit is not easy to manoeuvre the beak. To obtain the best mechanical\r\neffect the instrument must be applied perpendicularly to the convex\r\nsurface of the acorn, and the embarrassing implement which is carried in\r\nfront of the insect when the latter is not at work must now be held in\r\nsuch a position as to be beneath the worker.\r\n\r\nTo obtain this result the insect rears herself upon her hind legs,\r\nsupporting herself upon the tripod formed by the end of the wing-covers\r\nand the posterior tarsi. It would be hard to imagine anything more\r\ncurious than this little carpenter, as she stands upright and brings her\r\nnasal bradawl down towards her body.\r\n\r\nNow the drill is held plumb against the surface, and the boring\r\ncommences. The method is that I witnessed in the wood on the day of the\r\nstorm. Very slowly the insect veers round from right to left, then from\r\nleft to right. Her drill is not a spiral gimlet which will sink itself\r\nby a constant rotary motion; it is a bradawl, or rather a trochar, which\r\nprogresses by little bites, by alternative erosion, first in one\r\ndirection, then the other.\r\n\r\nBefore continuing, let me record an accident which is too striking to be\r\npassed over. On various occasions I have found the insect dead in the\r\nmidst of its task. The body is in an extraordinary position, which would\r\nbe laughable if death were not always a serious thing, above all when it\r\ncomes suddenly, in the midst of labour.\r\n\r\nThe drill is implanted in the acorn just a little beyond the tip; the\r\nwork was only commenced. At the top of the drill, at right angles to it,\r\nthe Balaninus is suspended in the air, far from the supporting surface\r\nof the acorn. It is dried, mummified, dead I know not how long. The legs\r\nare rigid and contracted under the body. Even if they retained the\r\nflexibility and the power of extension that were theirs in life, they\r\nwould fall far short of the surface of the acorn. What then has\r\nhappened, that this unhappy insect should be impaled like a specimen\r\nbeetle with a pin through its head?\r\n\r\nAn accident of the workshop is responsible. On account of the length of\r\nits implement the beetle commences her work standing upright, supported\r\nby the two hind-legs. Imagine a slip, a false step on the part of the\r\ntwo adhesive feet; the unfortunate creature will immediately lose her\r\nfooting, dragged by the elasticity of the snout, which she was forced to\r\nbend somewhat at the beginning. Torn away from her foothold, the\r\nsuspended insect vainly struggles in air; nowhere can her feet, those\r\nsafety anchors, find a hold. She starves at the end of her snout, for\r\nlack of foothold whereby to extricate herself. Like the artisans in our\r\nfactories, the elephant-beetle is sometimes the victim of her tools. Let\r\nus wish her good luck, and sure feet, careful not to slip, and proceed.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion all goes well, but so slowly that the descent of the\r\ndrill, even when amplified by the magnifying-glass, cannot be perceived.\r\nThe insect veers round perpetually, rests, and resumes her work. An hour\r\npasses, two hours, wearying the observer by their sustained attention;\r\nfor I wish to witness the precise moment when the beetle withdraws her\r\ndrill, turns round, and deposits her egg in the mouth of the orifice.\r\nThis, at least, is how I foresee the event.\r\n\r\nTwo hours go by, exhausting my patience. I call the household to my aid.\r\nThree of us take turns, keeping an uninterrupted watch upon the\r\npersevering creature whose secret I intend at any cost to discover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. THE GREY LOCUST.\r\n\r\n1'. THE NERVATURES OF THE WING.\r\n\r\n2. THE BALANINUS FALLEN A VICTIM TO THE LENGTH OF HER PROBOSCIS.]\r\n\r\nIt was well that I called in helpers to lend me their eyes and their\r\nattention. After eight hours--eight interminable hours, when it was\r\nnearly night, the sentinel on the watch calls me. The insect appears to\r\nhave finished. She does, in fact, very cautiously withdraw her beak, as\r\nthough fearing to slip. Once the tool is withdrawn she holds it pointing\r\ndirectly in front of her.\r\n\r\nThe moment has come.... Alas, no! Once more I am cheated; my eight hours\r\nof observation have been fruitless. The Balaninus decamps; abandons her\r\nacorn without laying her eggs. I was certainly right to distrust the\r\nresult of observation in the open woods. Such concentration among the\r\noaks, exposed to the sun, wind, and rain would have been an intolerable\r\ntask.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of October, with the aid of such helpers as are needed,\r\nI remark a number of borings, not followed by the laying of eggs. The\r\nduration of the observer's task varies greatly. It usually amounts to a\r\ncouple of hours; sometimes it exceeds half the day.\r\n\r\nWith what object are these perforations made, so laborious and yet so\r\noften unused? Let us first of all discover the position of the egg, and\r\nthe first mouthfuls taken by the grub, and perhaps the reply will be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe peopled acorns remain on the oak, held in their cups as though\r\nnothing had occurred to the detriment of the cotyledons. With a little\r\nattention they may be readily recognised. Not far from the cup, on the\r\nsmooth, still green envelope of the acorn a little point is visible; a\r\ntiny needle-prick. A narrow brown aureole, the product of mortification,\r\nis not long in appearing. This marks the opening of the hole. Sometimes,\r\nbut more rarely, the hole is drilled through the cup itself.\r\n\r\nLet us select those acorns which have been recently perforated: that is\r\nto say, those in which the perforation is not yet surrounded by the\r\nbrown ring which appears in course of time. Let us shell them. Many\r\ncontain nothing out of the way; the Balaninus has bored them but has not\r\nlaid her eggs in them. They resemble the acorns which for hours and\r\nhours were drilled in my laboratory but not utilised. Many, on the\r\ncontrary, contain an egg.\r\n\r\nNow however distant the entrance of the bore may be, this egg is always\r\nat the bottom of the acorn, within the cup, at the base of the\r\ncotyledonary matter. The cup furnishes a thin film like swan-skin which\r\nimbibes the sapid exudations from the stem, the source of nourishment. I\r\nhave seen a young grub, hatched under my eyes, eat as his first\r\nmouthfuls this tender cottony layer, which is moist and flavoured with\r\ntannin.\r\n\r\nSuch nutriment, juicy and easy of digestion, like all nascent organic\r\nmatter, is only found in this particular spot; and it is only there,\r\nbetween the cup and the base of the cotyledons, that the elephant-beetle\r\nestablishes her egg. The insect knows to a nicety the position of the\r\nportions best adapted to the feeble stomach of the newly hatched larva.\r\n\r\nAbove this is the tougher nutriment of the cotyledons. Refreshed by its\r\nfirst meal, the grub proceeds to attack this; not directly, but in the\r\ntunnel bored by the mother, which is littered with tiny crumbs and\r\nhalf-masticated shavings. With this light mealy diet the strength of the\r\ngrub increases, and it then plunges directly into the substance of the\r\nacorn.\r\n\r\nThese data explain the tactics of the gravid mother. What is her object\r\nwhen, before proceeding to sink her hole, she inspects her acorn, from\r\nabove, below, before and behind, with such meticulous care? She is\r\nmaking sure that the acorn is not already occupied. The larder is amply\r\nstored, but it does not contain enough for two. Never in fact, have I\r\nfound two larvæ in the same acorn. One only, always only one, digests\r\nthe copious meal and converts it into a greenish dust before leaving it\r\nand descending to the ground. Only an insignificant shell remains\r\nuneaten. The rule is, to each grub one acorn.\r\n\r\nBefore trusting the egg to the acorn it is therefore essential to\r\nsubject it to a thorough examination, to discover whether it already has\r\nan occupant. This possible occupant would be at the base of the acorn,\r\nunder the cover of the cup. Nothing could be more secret than this\r\nhiding-place. Not an eye could divine the inhabitant if the surface of\r\nthe acorn did not bear the mark of a tiny perforation.\r\n\r\nThis mark, just visible, is my guide. Its presence tells me that the\r\nacorn is inhabited, or at least that it has been prepared for the\r\nreception of the egg; its absence tells me that the acorn has not yet\r\nbeen appropriated. The elephant-beetle undoubtedly draws the same\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nI see matters from on high, with a comprehensive glance, assisted at\r\nwill by the magnifying-glass. I turn the acorn between my fingers for a\r\nmoment, and the inspection is concluded. The beetle, investigating the\r\nacorn at close quarters, is often obliged to scrutinise practically the\r\nentire surface before detecting the tell-tale spot. Moreover, the\r\nwelfare of her family demands a far more careful search than does my\r\ncuriosity. This is the reason for her prolonged and deliberate\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe search is concluded; the acorn is recognised as unoccupied. The\r\ndrill is applied to the surface and rotated for hours; then, very often,\r\nthe insect departs, disdaining the result of her work. Why such\r\nprotracted efforts? Was the beetle piercing the fruit merely to obtain\r\ndrink and refreshment? Was the beak thrust into the depths of the base\r\nmerely to obtain, from the choicer parts, a few sips of nutritious sap?\r\nWas the whole undertaking merely a matter of personal nourishment?\r\n\r\nAt first I believed this to be the solution, though surprised at the\r\ndisplay of so much perseverance rewarded by the merest sip. The\r\nbehaviour of the males, however, forced me to abandon this idea. They\r\nalso possess the long beak, and could readily make such perforations if\r\nthey wished; yet I have never seen one take up his stand upon an acorn\r\nand work at it with his augur. Then why this fruitless labour? A mere\r\nnothing suffices these abstemious creatures. A superficial operation\r\nperformed upon the surface of a tender leaf yields them sufficient\r\nsustenance.\r\n\r\nIf the males, the unoccupied males who have leisure to enjoy the\r\npleasures of the palate, ask no more than the sap of the leaf, how\r\nshould the mothers, busied with the affairs of the breeding-season, find\r\ntime to waste upon such dearly bought pleasures as the inner juices of\r\nthe acorn? No, the acorn is not perforated for the purpose of drinking\r\nits juices. It is possible that once the beak is deeply sunk, the female\r\nmay take a mouthful or two, but it is certain that food and drink are\r\nnot the objects in view.\r\n\r\nAt last I begin to foresee the solution of the problem. The egg, as I\r\nhave said, is always at the base of the acorn, in the midst of a soft\r\ncottony layer which is moistened by the sap which oozes from the stalk.\r\nThe grub, upon hatching out, being as yet incapable of attacking the\r\nfirm substance of the cotyledons, masticates the delicate felt-like\r\nlayer at the base of the cup and is nourished by its juices.\r\n\r\nBut as the acorn matures this layer becomes more solid in its\r\nconsistency. The soft tissues harden; the moist tissues dry up. There is\r\na period during which the acorn fulfils to perfection the conditions\r\nmost conducive to the welfare of the grub. At an earlier period matters\r\nwould not have reached the desired stage; at a later period the acorn\r\nwould be too mature.\r\n\r\nThe exterior of the acorn gives no indication whatever of the progress\r\nof this internal cookery. In order not to inflict unsuitable food on the\r\ngrub, the mother beetle, not sufficiently informed by the look of the\r\nacorn, is thus obliged to taste, at the end of her trunk, the tissues at\r\nthe base of the cup.\r\n\r\nThe nurse, before giving her charge a spoonful of broth, tests it by\r\ntasting it. In the same way the mother beetle plunges her trunk into the\r\nbase of the cup, to test the contents before bestowing them upon her\r\noffspring. If the food is recognised as being satisfactory the egg is\r\nlaid; if not, the perforation is abandoned without more ado. This\r\nexplains the perforations which serve no purpose, in spite of so much\r\nlabour; the tissues at the base of the cup, being carefully tested, are\r\nnot found to be in the required condition. The elephant-beetles are\r\ndifficult to please and take infinite pains when the first mouthful of\r\nthe grub is in question. To place the egg in a position where the\r\nnew-born grub will find light and juicy and easily digested nutriment is\r\nnot enough for those far-seeing mothers; their cares look beyond this\r\npoint. An intermediary period is desirable, which will lead the little\r\nlarva from the delicacies of its first hours to the diet of hard acorn.\r\nThis intermediary period is passed in the gallery, the work of the\r\nmaternal beak. There it finds the crumbs, the shavings bitten off by the\r\nchisels of the rostrum. Moreover, the walls of the tunnel, which are\r\nsoftened by mortification, are better suited than the rest of the acorn\r\nto the tender mandibles of the larva.\r\n\r\nBefore setting to work on the cotyledons the grub does, in fact,\r\ncommence upon the contents and walls of this tiny passage. It first\r\nconsumes the shavings lying loose in the passage; it devours the brown\r\nfragments adhering to the walls; finally, being now sufficiently\r\nstrengthened, it attacks the body of the acorn, plunges into it, and\r\ndisappears. The stomach is ready; the rest is a blissful feast.\r\n\r\nThis intermediary tunnel must be of a certain length, in order to\r\nsatisfy the needs of infancy, so the mother must labour at the work of\r\ndrilling. If the perforation were made solely with the purpose of\r\ntasting the material at the base of the acorn and recognising its degree\r\nof maturity, the operation might be very much shorter, since the hole\r\ncould be sunk through the cup itself from a point close to the base.\r\nThis fact is not unrecognised; I have on occasion found the insect\r\nperforating the scaly cup.\r\n\r\nIn such a proceeding I see the attempt of a gravid mother pressed for\r\ntime to obtain prompt information. If the acorn is suitable the boring\r\nwill be recommenced at a more distant point, through the surface of the\r\nacorn itself. When an egg is to be laid the rule is to bore the hole\r\nfrom a point as distant as is practicable from the base--as far, in\r\nshort, as the length of the rostrum will permit.\r\n\r\nWhat is the object of this long perforation, which often occupies more\r\nthan half the day? Why this tenacious perseverance when, not far from\r\nthe stalk, at the cost of much less time and fatigue, the rostrum could\r\nattain the desired point--the living spring from which the new-born grub\r\nis to drink? The mother has her own reasons for toiling in this manner;\r\nin doing thus she still attains the necessary point, the base of the\r\nacorn, and at the same time--a most valuable result--she prepares for\r\nthe grub a long tube of fine, easily digested meal.\r\n\r\nBut these are trivialities! Not so, if you please, but high and\r\nimportant matters, speaking to us of the infinite pains which preside\r\nover the preservation of the least of things; witnesses of a superior\r\nlogic which regulates the smallest details.\r\n\r\nThe Balaninus, so happily inspired as a mother, has her place in the\r\nworld and is worthy of notice. So, at least, thinks the blackbird, which\r\ngladly makes a meal of the insect with the long beak when fruits grow\r\nrare at the end of autumn. It makes a small mouthful, but a tasty, and\r\nis a pleasant change after such olives as yet withstand the cold.\r\n\r\nAnd what without the blackbird and its rivalry of song were the\r\nreawakening of the woods in spring? Were man to disappear, annihilated\r\nby his own foolish errors, the festival of the life-bringing season\r\nwould be no less worthily observed, celebrated by the fluting of the\r\nyellow-billed songster.\r\n\r\nTo the meritorious rôle of regaling the blackbird, the minstrel of the\r\nforest, the Balaninus adds another--that of moderating the superfluity\r\nof vegetation. Like all the mighty who are worthy of their strength, the\r\noak is generous; it produces acorns by the bushel. What could the earth\r\ndo with such prodigality? The forest would stifle itself for want of\r\nroom; excess would ruin the necessary.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner is this abundance of food produced than there is an influx\r\nfrom every side of consumers only too eager to abate this inordinate\r\nproduction. The field-mouse, a native of the woods, stores acorns in a\r\ngravel-heap near its hay-lined nest. A stranger, the jay, comes in\r\nflocks from far away, warned I know not how. For some weeks it flies\r\nfeasting from oak to oak, giving vent to its joys and its emotions in a\r\nvoice like that of a strangling cat; then, its mission accomplished, it\r\nreturns to the North whence it came.\r\n\r\nThe Balaninus has anticipated them all. The mother confided her eggs to\r\nthe acorns while yet they were green. These have now fallen to earth,\r\nbrown before their time, and pierced by a round hole through which the\r\nlarva has escaped after devouring the contents. Under one single oak a\r\nbasket might easily be filled with these ruined shells. More than the\r\njay, more than the field-mouse, the elephant-beetle has contributed to\r\nreduce the superfluity of acorns.\r\n\r\nPresently man arrives, busied in the interest of his pig. In my village\r\nit is quite an important event when the municipal hoardings announce the\r\nday for opening the municipal woods for the gathering of acorns. The\r\nmore zealous visit the woods the day before and select the best places.\r\nNext day, at daybreak, the whole family is there. The father beats the\r\nupper branches with a pole; the mother, wearing a heavy hempen apron\r\nwhich enables her to force her way through the stubborn undergrowth,\r\ngathers those within reach of the hand, while the children collect those\r\nscattered upon the ground. First the small baskets are filled, then the\r\nbig _corbeilles_, and then the sacks.\r\n\r\nAfter the field-mouse, the jay, the weevil, and so many others have\r\ntaken toll comes man, calculating how many pounds of bacon-fat his\r\nharvest will be worth. One regret mingles with the cheer of the\r\noccasion; it is to see so many acorns scattered on the ground which are\r\npierced, spoiled, good for nothing. And man curses the author of this\r\ndestruction; to hear him you would think the forest is meant for him\r\nalone, and that the oaks bear acorns only for the sake of his pig.\r\n\r\nMy friend, I would say to him, the forest guard cannot take legal\r\nproceedings against the offender, and it is just as well, for our\r\negoism, which is inclined to see in the acorn only a garland of\r\nsausages, would have annoying results. The oak calls the whole world to\r\nenjoy its fruits. We take the larger part because we are the stronger.\r\nThat is our only right.\r\n\r\nMore important than our rights is the equitable division of the fruits\r\nof the earth between the various consumers, great and little, all of\r\nwhom play their part in this world. If it is good that the blackbird\r\nshould flute and rejoice in the burgeoning of the spring, then it is no\r\nbad thing that acorns should be worm-eaten. In the acorn the dessert of\r\nthe blackbird is prepared; the Balaninus, the tasty mouthful that puts\r\nflesh upon his flanks and music into his throat.\r\n\r\nLet the blackbird sing, and let us return to the eggs of the\r\nCurculionidæ. We know where the egg is--at the base of the acorn,\r\nbecause the tenderest and most juicy tissues of the fruit are there. But\r\nhow did it get there, so far from the point of entry? A very trifling\r\nquestion, it is true; puerile even, if you will. Do not let us disdain\r\nto ask it; science is made of these puerilities.\r\n\r\nThe first man to rub a piece of amber on his sleeve and to find that it\r\nthereupon attracted fragments of chaff had certainly no vision of the\r\nelectric marvels of our days. He was amusing himself in a childlike\r\nmanner. Repeated, tested, and probed in every imaginable way, the\r\nchild's experiment has become one of the forces of the world.\r\n\r\nThe observer must neglect nothing; for he never knows what may develop\r\nout of the humblest fact. So again we will ask: by what process did the\r\negg of the elephant-beetle reach a point so far from the orifice in the\r\nacorn?\r\n\r\nTo one who was not already aware of the position of the egg, but knew\r\nthat the grub attacked the base of the acorn first, the solution of that\r\nfact would be as follows: the egg is laid at the entrance of the tunnel,\r\nat the surface, and the grub, crawling down the gallery sunk by the\r\nmother, gains of its own accord this distant point where its infant diet\r\nis to be found.\r\n\r\nBefore I had sufficient data this was my own belief; but the mistake was\r\nsoon exposed. I plucked an acorn just as the mother withdrew, after\r\nhaving for a moment applied the tip of the abdomen to the orifice of the\r\npassage just opened by her rostrum. The egg, so it seemed, must be\r\nthere, at the entrance of the passage.... But no, it was not! It was at\r\nthe other extremity of the passage! If I dared, I would say it had\r\ndropped like a stone into a well.\r\n\r\nThat idea we must abandon at once; the passage is extremely narrow and\r\nencumbered with shavings, so that such a thing would be impossible.\r\nMoreover, according to the direction of the stem, accordingly as it\r\npointed upwards or downwards, the egg would have to fall downwards in\r\none acorn and upwards in another.\r\n\r\nA second explanation suggests itself, not less perilous. It might be\r\nsaid: \"The cuckoo lays her egg on the grass, no matter where; she lifts\r\nit in her beak and places it in the nearest appropriate nest.\" Might not\r\nthe Balaninus follow an analogous method? Does she employ the rostrum to\r\nplace the egg in its position at the base of the acorn? I cannot see\r\nthat the insect has any other implement capable of reaching this remote\r\nhiding-place.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we must hastily reject such an absurd explanation as a\r\nlast, desperate resort. The elephant-beetle certainly does not lay its\r\negg in the open and seize it in its beak. If it did so the delicate ovum\r\nwould certainly be destroyed, crushed in the attempt to thrust it down a\r\nnarrow passage half choked with debris.\r\n\r\nThis is very perplexing. My embarrassment will be shared by all readers\r\nwho are acquainted with the structure of the elephant-beetle. The\r\ngrasshopper has a sabre, an oviscapt which plunges into the earth and\r\nsows the eggs at the desired depth; the Leuscopis has a probe which\r\nfinds its way through the masonry of the mason-bee and lays the egg in\r\nthe cocoon of the great somnolent larva; but the Balaninus has none of\r\nthese swords, daggers, or pikes; she has nothing but the tip of her\r\nabdomen. Yet she has only to apply that abdominal extremity to the\r\nopening of the passage, and the egg is immediately lodged at the very\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nAnatomy will give us the answer to the riddle, which is otherwise\r\nindecipherable. I open the body of a gravid female. There, before my\r\neyes, is something that takes my breath away. There, occupying the whole\r\nlength of the body, is an extraordinary device; a red, horny, rigid rod;\r\nI had almost said a rostrum, so greatly does it resemble the implement\r\nwhich the insect carries on his head. It is a tube, fine as a horsehair,\r\nslightly enlarged at the free extremity, like an old-fashioned\r\nblunderbuss, and expanding to form an egg-shaped capsule at the point of\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThis is the oviduct, and its dimensions are the same as those of the\r\nrostrum. As far as the perforating beak can plunge, so far the oviscapt,\r\nthe interior rostrum, will reach. When working upon her acorn the female\r\nchooses the point of attack so that the two complementary instruments\r\ncan each of them reach the desired point at the base of the acorn.\r\n\r\nThe matter now explains itself. The work of drilling completed, the\r\ngallery ready, the mother turns and places the tip of the abdomen\r\nagainst the orifice. She extrudes the internal mechanism, which easily\r\npasses through the loose debris of the boring. No sign of the probe\r\nappears, so quickly and discreetly does it work; nor is any trace of it\r\nto be seen when, the egg having been properly deposited, the implement\r\nascends and returns to the abdomen. It is over, and the mother departs,\r\nand we have not caught a glimpse of her internal mechanism.\r\n\r\nWas I not right to insist? An apparently insignificant fact has led to\r\nthe authentic proof of a fact that the Larinidæ had already made me\r\nsuspect. The long-beaked weevils have an internal probe, an abdominal\r\nrostrum, which nothing in their external appearance betrays; they\r\npossess, among the hidden organs of the abdomen, the counterpart of the\r\ngrasshopper's sabre and the ichneumon's dagger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE PEA-WEEVIL--_BRUCHUS PISI_\r\n\r\n\r\nPeas are held in high esteem by mankind. From remote ages man has\r\nendeavoured, by careful culture, to produce larger, tenderer, and\r\nsweeter varieties. Of an adaptable character, under careful treatment\r\nthe plant has evolved in a docile fashion, and has ended by giving us\r\nwhat the ambition of the gardener desired. To-day we have gone far\r\nbeyond the yield of the Varrons and Columelles, and further still beyond\r\nthe original pea; from the wild seeds confided to the soil by the first\r\nman who thought to scratch up the surface of the earth, perhaps with the\r\nhalf-jaw of a cave-bear, whose powerful canine tooth would serve him as\r\na ploughshare!\r\n\r\nWhere is it, this original pea, in the world of spontaneous vegetation?\r\nOur own country has nothing resembling it. Is it to be found elsewhere?\r\nOn this point botany is silent, or replies only with vague\r\nprobabilities.\r\n\r\nWe find the same ignorance elsewhere on the subject of the majority of\r\nour alimentary vegetables. Whence comes wheat, the blessed grain which\r\ngives us bread? No one knows. You will not find it here, except in the\r\ncare of man; nor will you find it abroad. In the East, the birthplace\r\nof agriculture, no botanist has ever encountered the sacred ear growing\r\nof itself on unbroken soil.\r\n\r\nBarley, oats, and rye, the turnip and the beet, the beetroot, the\r\ncarrot, the pumpkin, and so many other vegetable products, leave us in\r\nthe same perplexity; their point of departure is unknown to us, or at\r\nmost suspected behind the impenetrable cloud of the centuries. Nature\r\ndelivered them to us in the full vigour of the thing untamed, when their\r\nvalue as food was indifferent, as to-day she offers us the sloe, the\r\nbullace, the blackberry, the crab; she gave them to us in the state of\r\nimperfect sketches, for us to fill out and complete; it was for our\r\nskill and our labour patiently to induce the nourishing pulp which was\r\nthe earliest form of capital, whose interest is always increasing in the\r\nprimordial bank of the tiller of the soil.\r\n\r\nAs storehouses of food the cereal and the vegetable are, for the greater\r\npart, the work of man. The fundamental species, a poor resource in their\r\noriginal state, we borrowed as they were from the natural treasury of\r\nthe vegetable world; the perfected race, rich in alimentary materials,\r\nis the result of our art.\r\n\r\nIf wheat, peas, and all the rest are indispensable to us, our care, by a\r\njust return, is absolutely necessary to them. Such as our needs have\r\nmade them, incapable of resistance in the bitter struggle for survival,\r\nthese vegetables, left to themselves without culture, would rapidly\r\ndisappear, despite the numerical abundance of their seeds, as the\r\nfoolish sheep would disappear were there no more sheep-folds.\r\n\r\nThey are our work, but not always our exclusive property. Wherever food\r\nis amassed, the consumers collect from the four corners of the sky; they\r\ninvite themselves to the feast of abundance, and the richer the food the\r\ngreater their numbers. Man, who alone is capable of inducing agrarian\r\nabundance, is by that very fact the giver of an immense banquet at which\r\nlegions of feasters take their place. By creating more juicy and more\r\ngenerous fruits he calls to his enclosures, despite himself, thousands\r\nand thousands of hungry creatures, against whose appetites his\r\nprohibitions are helpless. The more he produces, the larger is the\r\ntribute demanded of him. Wholesale agriculture and vegetable abundance\r\nfavour our rival the insect.\r\n\r\nThis is the immanent law. Nature, with an equal zeal, offers her mighty\r\nbreast to all her nurslings alike; to those who live by the goods of\r\nothers no less than to the producers. For us, who plough, sow, and reap,\r\nand weary ourselves with labour, she ripens the wheat; she ripens it\r\nalso for the little Calender-beetle, which, although exempted from the\r\nlabour of the fields, enters our granaries none the less, and there,\r\nwith its pointed beak, nibbles our wheat, grain by grain, to the husk.\r\n\r\nFor us, who dig, weed, and water, bent with fatigue and burned by the\r\nsun, she swells the pods of the pea; she swells them also for the\r\nweevil, which does no gardener's work, yet takes its share of the\r\nharvest at its own hour, when the earth is joyful with the new life of\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nLet us follow the manoeuvres of this insect which takes its tithe of\r\nthe green pea. I, a benevolent ratepayer, will allow it to take its\r\ndues; it is precisely to benefit it that I have sown a few rows of the\r\nbeloved plant in a corner of my garden. Without other invitation on my\r\npart than this modest expenditure of seed-peas it arrives punctually\r\nduring the month of May. It has learned that this stony soil, rebellious\r\nto the culture of the kitchen-gardener, is bearing peas for the first\r\ntime. In all haste therefore it has hurried, an agent of the\r\nentomological revenue system, to demand its dues.\r\n\r\nWhence does it come? It is impossible to say precisely. It has come from\r\nsome shelter, somewhere, in which it has passed the winter in a state of\r\ntorpor. The plane-tree, which sheds its rind during the heats of the\r\nsummer, furnishes an excellent refuge for homeless insects under its\r\npartly detached sheets of bark.\r\n\r\nI have often found our weevil in such a winter refuge. Sheltered under\r\nthe dead covering of the plane, or otherwise protected while the winter\r\nlasts, it awakens from its torpor at the first touch of a kindly sun.\r\nThe almanack of the instincts has aroused it; it knows as well as the\r\ngardener when the pea-vines are in flower, and seeks its favourite\r\nplant, journeying thither from every side, running with quick, short\r\nsteps, or nimbly flying.\r\n\r\nA small head, a fine snout, a costume of ashen grey sprinkled with\r\nbrown, flattened wing-covers, a dumpy, compact body, with two large\r\nblack dots on the rear segment--such is the summary portrait of my\r\nvisitor. The middle of May approaches, and with it the van of the\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\nThey settle on the flowers, which are not unlike white-winged\r\nbutterflies. I see them at the base of the blossom or inside the cavity\r\nof the \"keel\" of the flower, but the majority explore the petals and\r\ntake possession of them. The time for laying the eggs has not yet\r\narrived. The morning is mild; the sun is warm without being oppressive.\r\nIt is the moment of nuptial flights; the time of rejoicing in the\r\nsplendour of the sunshine. Everywhere are creatures rejoicing to be\r\nalive. Couples come together, part, and re-form. When towards noon the\r\nheat becomes too great, the weevils retire into the shadow, taking\r\nrefuge singly in the folds of the flowers whose secret corners they know\r\nso well. To-morrow will be another day of festival, and the next day\r\nalso, until the pods, emerging from the shelter of the \"keel\" of the\r\nflower, are plainly visible, enlarging from day to day.\r\n\r\nA few gravid females, more pressed for time than the others, confide\r\ntheir eggs to the growing pod, flat and meagre as it issues from its\r\nfloral sheath. These hastily laid batches of eggs, expelled perhaps by\r\nthe exigencies of an ovary incapable of further delay, seem to me in\r\nserious danger; for the seed in which the grub must establish itself is\r\nas yet no more than a tender speck of green, without firmness and\r\nwithout any farinaceous tissue. No larva could possible find sufficient\r\nnourishment there, unless it waited for the pea to mature.\r\n\r\nBut is the grub capable of fasting for any length of time when once\r\nhatched? It is doubtful. The little I have seen tells me that the\r\nnew-born grub must establish itself in the midst of its food as quickly\r\nas possible, and that it perishes unless it can do so. I am therefore of\r\nopinion that such eggs as are deposited in immature pods are lost.\r\nHowever, the race will hardly suffer by such a loss, so fertile is the\r\nlittle beetle. We shall see directly how prodigal the female is of her\r\neggs, the majority of which are destined to perish.\r\n\r\nThe important part of the maternal task is completed by the end of May,\r\nwhen the shells are swollen by the expanding peas, which have reached\r\ntheir final growth, or are but little short of it. I was anxious to see\r\nthe female Bruchus at work in her quality of Curculionid, as our\r\nclassification declares her.[8] The other weevils are Rhyncophora,\r\nbeaked insects, armed with a drill with which to prepare the hole in\r\nwhich the egg is laid. The Bruchus possesses only a short snout or\r\nmuzzle, excellently adapted for eating soft tissues, but valueless as a\r\ndrill.\r\n\r\nThe method of installing the family is consequently absolutely\r\ndifferent. There are no industrious preparations as with the Balinidæ,\r\nthe Larinidæ, and the Rhynchitides. Not being equipped with a long\r\noviscapt, the mother sows her eggs in the open, with no protection\r\nagainst the heat of the sun and the variations of temperature. Nothing\r\ncould be simpler, and nothing more perilous to the eggs, in the absence\r\nof special characteristics which would enable them to resist the\r\nalternate trials of heat and cold, moisture and drought.\r\n\r\nIn the caressing sunlight of ten o'clock in the morning the mother runs\r\nup and down the chosen pod, first on one side, then on the other, with a\r\njerky, capricious, unmethodical gait. She repeatedly extrudes a short\r\noviduct, which oscillates right and left as though to graze the skin of\r\nthe pod. An egg follows, which is abandoned as soon as laid.\r\n\r\nA hasty touch of the oviduct, first here, then there, on the green skin\r\nof the pea-pod, and that is all. The egg is left there, unprotected, in\r\nthe full sunlight. No choice of position is made such as might assist\r\nthe grub when it seeks to penetrate its larder. Some eggs are laid on\r\nthe swellings created by the peas beneath; others in the barren valleys\r\nwhich separate them. The first are close to the peas, the second at some\r\ndistance from them. In short, the eggs of the Bruchus are laid at\r\nrandom, as though on the wing.\r\n\r\nWe observe a still more serious vice: the number of eggs is out of all\r\nproportion to the number of peas in the pod. Let us note at the outset\r\nthat each grub requires one pea; it is the necessary ration, and is\r\nlargely sufficient to one larva, but is not enough for several, nor even\r\nfor two. One pea to each grub, neither more nor less, is the\r\nunchangeable rule.\r\n\r\nWe should expect to find signs of a procreative economy which would\r\nimpel the female to take into account the number of peas contained in\r\nthe pod which she has just explored; we might expect her to set a\r\nnumerical limit on her eggs in conformity with that of the peas\r\navailable. But no such limit is observed. The rule of one pea to one\r\ngrub is always contradicted by the multiplicity of consumers.\r\n\r\nMy observations are unanimous on this point. The number of eggs\r\ndeposited on one pod always exceeds the number of peas available, and\r\noften to a scandalous degree. However meagre the contents of the pod\r\nthere is a superabundance of consumers. Dividing the sum of the eggs\r\nupon such or such a pod by that of the peas contained therein, I find\r\nthere are five to eight claimants for each pea; I have found ten, and\r\nthere is no reason why this prodigality should not go still further.\r\nMany are called, but few are chosen! What is to become of all these\r\nsupernumeraries, perforce excluded from the banquet for want of space?\r\n\r\nThe eggs are of a fairly bright amber yellow, cylindrical in form,\r\nsmooth, and rounded at the ends. Their length is at most a twenty-fifth\r\nof an inch. Each is affixed to the pod by means of a slight network of\r\nthreads of coagulated albumen. Neither wind nor rain can loosen their\r\nhold.\r\n\r\nThe mother not infrequently emits them two at a time, one above the\r\nother; not infrequently, also, the uppermost of the two eggs hatches\r\nbefore the other, while the latter fades and perishes. What was lacking\r\nto this egg, that it should fail to produce a grub? Perhaps a bath of\r\nsunlight; the incubating heat of which the outer egg has robbed it.\r\nWhether on account of the fact that it is shadowed by the other egg, or\r\nfor other reasons, the elder of the eggs in a group of two rarely\r\nfollows the normal course, but perishes on the pod, dead without having\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nThere are exceptions to this premature end; sometimes the two eggs\r\ndevelop equally well; but such cases are exceptional, so that the\r\nBruchid family would be reduced to about half its dimensions if the\r\nbinary system were the rule. To the detriment of our peas and to the\r\nadvantage of the beetle, the eggs are commonly laid one by one and in\r\nisolation.\r\n\r\nA recent emergence is shown by a little sinuous ribbon-like mark, pale\r\nor whitish, where the skin of the pod is raised and withered, which\r\nstarts from the egg and is the work of the new-born larva; a\r\nsub-epidermic tunnel along which the grub works its way, while seeking a\r\npoint from which it can escape into a pea. This point once attained, the\r\nlarva, which is scarcely a twenty-fifth of an inch in length, and is\r\nwhite with a black head, perforates the envelope and plunges into the\r\ncapacious hollow of the pod.\r\n\r\nIt has reached the peas and crawls upon the nearest. I have observed it\r\nwith the magnifier. Having explored the green globe, its new world, it\r\nbegins to sink a well perpendicularly into the sphere. I have often seen\r\nit half-way in, wriggling its tail in the effort to work the quicker. In\r\na short time the grub disappears and is at home. The point of entry,\r\nminute, but always easily recognisable by its brown coloration on the\r\npale green background of the pea, has no fixed location; it may be at\r\nalmost any point on the surface of the pea, but an exception is usually\r\nmade of the lower half; that is, the hemisphere whose pole is formed by\r\nthe supporting stem.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely in this portion that the germ is found, which will not\r\nbe eaten by the larva, and will remain capable of developing into a\r\nplant, in spite of the large aperture made by the emergence of the adult\r\ninsect. Why is this particular portion left untouched? What are the\r\nmotives that safeguard the germ?\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that the Bruchus is not considering the gardener.\r\nThe pea is meant for it and for no one else. In refusing the few bites\r\nthat would lead to the death of the seed, it has no intention of\r\nlimiting its destruction. It abstains from other motives.\r\n\r\nLet us remark that the peas touch laterally, and are pressed one\r\nagainst the other, so that the grub, when searching for a point of\r\nattack, cannot circulate at will. Let us also note that the lower pole\r\nexpands into the umbilical excrescence, which is less easy of\r\nperforation than those parts protected by the skin alone. It is even\r\npossible that the umbilicum, whose organisation differs from that of the\r\nrest of the pea, contains a peculiar sap that is distasteful to the\r\nlittle grub.\r\n\r\nSuch, doubtless, is the reason why the peas exploited by the Bruchus are\r\nstill able to germinate. They are damaged, but not dead, because the\r\ninvasion was conducted from the free hemisphere, a portion less\r\nvulnerable and more easy of access. Moreover, as the pea in its entirety\r\nis too large for a single grub to consume, the consumption is limited to\r\nthe portion preferred by the consumer, and this portion is not the\r\nessential portion of the pea.\r\n\r\nWith other conditions, with very much smaller or very much larger seeds,\r\nwe shall observe very different results. If too small, the germ will\r\nperish, gnawed like the rest by the insufficiently provisioned inmate;\r\nif too large, the abundance of food will permit of several inmates.\r\nExploited in the absence of the pea, the cultivated vetch and the broad\r\nbean afford us an excellent example; the smaller seed, of which all but\r\nthe skin is devoured, is left incapable of germination; but the large\r\nbean, even though it may have held a number of grubs, is still capable\r\nof sprouting.\r\n\r\nKnowing that the pod always exhibits a number of eggs greatly in excess\r\nof the enclosed peas, and that each pea is the exclusive property of one\r\ngrub, we naturally ask what becomes of the superfluous grubs. Do they\r\nperish outside when the more precocious have one by one taken their\r\nplaces in their vegetable larder? or do they succumb to the intolerant\r\nteeth of the first occupants? Neither explanation is correct. Let us\r\nrelate the facts.\r\n\r\nOn all old peas--they are at this stage dry--from which the adult\r\nBruchus has emerged, leaving a large round hole of exit, the\r\nmagnifying-glass will show a variable number of fine reddish\r\npunctuations, perforated in the centre. What are these spots, of which I\r\ncount five, six, and even more on a single pea? It is impossible to be\r\nmistaken: they are the points of entry of as many grubs. Several grubs\r\nhave entered the pea, but of the whole group only one has survived,\r\nfattened, and attained the adult age. And the others? We shall see.\r\n\r\nAt the end of May, and in June, the period of egg-laying, let us inspect\r\nthe still green and tender peas. Nearly all the peas invaded show us the\r\nmultiple perforations already observed on the dry peas abandoned by the\r\nweevils. Does this actually mean that there are several grubs in the\r\npea? Yes. Skin the peas in question, separate the cotyledons, and break\r\nthem up as may be necessary. We shall discover several grubs, extremely\r\nyouthful, curled up comma-wise, fat and lively, each in a little round\r\nniche in the body of the pea.\r\n\r\nPeace and welfare seem to reign in the little community. There is no\r\nquarrelling, no jealousy between neighbours. The feast has commenced;\r\nfood is abundant, and the feasters are separated one from another by the\r\nwalls of uneaten substance. With this isolation in separate cells no\r\nconflicts need be feared; no sudden bite of the mandibles, whether\r\nintentional or accidental. All the occupants enjoy the same rights of\r\nproperty, the same appetite, and the same strength. How does this\r\ncommunal feast terminate?\r\n\r\nHaving first opened them, I place a number of peas which are found to be\r\nwell peopled in a glass test-tube. I open others daily. In this way I\r\nkeep myself informed as to the progress of the various larvæ. At first\r\nnothing noteworthy is to be seen. Isolated in its narrow chamber, each\r\ngrub nibbles the substance around it, peacefully and parsimoniously. It\r\nis still very small; a mere speck of food is a feast; but the contents\r\nof one pea will not suffice the whole number to the end. Famine is\r\nahead, and all but one must perish.\r\n\r\nSoon, indeed, the aspect of things is entirely changed. One of the\r\ngrubs--that which occupies the central position in the pea--begins to\r\ngrow more quickly than the others. Scarcely has it surpassed the others\r\nin size when the latter cease to eat, and no longer attempt to burrow\r\nforwards. They lie motionless and resigned; they die that gentle death\r\nwhich comes to unconscious lives. Henceforth the entire pea belongs to\r\nthe sole survivor. Now what has happened that these lives around the\r\nprivileged one should be thus annihilated? In default of a satisfactory\r\nreply, I will propose a suggestion.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of the pea, less ripened than the rest of the seed by the\r\nchemistry of the sun, may there not be a softer pulp, of a quality\r\nbetter adapted to the infantile digestion of the grub? There, perhaps,\r\nbeing nourished by tenderer, sweeter, and perhaps more tasty tissues,\r\nthe stomach becomes more vigorous, until it is fit to undertake less\r\neasily digested food. A nursling is fed on milk before proceeding to\r\nbread and broth. May not the central portion of the pea be the\r\nfeeding-bottle of the Bruchid?\r\n\r\nWith equal rights, fired by an equal ambition, all the occupants of the\r\npea bore their way towards the delicious morsel. The journey is\r\nlaborious, and the grubs must rest frequently in their provisional\r\nniches. They rest; while resting they frugally gnaw the riper tissues\r\nsurrounding them; they gnaw rather to open a way than to fill their\r\nstomachs.\r\n\r\nFinally one of the excavators, favoured by the direction taken, attains\r\nthe central portion. It establishes itself there, and all is over; the\r\nothers have only to die. How are they warned that the place is taken? Do\r\nthey hear their brother gnawing at the walls of his lodging? can they\r\nfeel the vibration set up by his nibbling mandibles? Something of the\r\nkind must happen, for from that moment they make no attempt to burrow\r\nfurther. Without struggling against the fortunate winner, without\r\nseeking to dislodge him, those which are beaten in the race give\r\nthemselves up to death. I admire this candid resignation on the part of\r\nthe departed.\r\n\r\nAnother condition--that of space--is also present as a factor. The\r\npea-weevil is the largest of our Bruchidæ. When it attains the adult\r\nstage it requires a certain amplitude of lodging, which the other\r\nweevils do not require in the same degree. A pea provides it with a\r\nsufficiently spacious cell; nevertheless, the cohabitation of two in one\r\npea would be impossible; there would be no room, even were the two to\r\nput up with a certain discomfort. Hence the necessity of an inevitable\r\ndecimation, which will suppress all the competitors save one.\r\n\r\nNow the superior volume of the broad bean, which is almost as much\r\nbeloved by the weevil as the pea, can lodge a considerable community,\r\nand the solitary can live as a cenobite. Without encroaching on the\r\ndomain of their neighbours, five or six or more can find room in the one\r\nbean.\r\n\r\nMoreover, each grub can find its infant diet; that is, that layer which,\r\nremote from the surface, hardens only gradually and remains full of sap\r\nuntil a comparatively late period. This inner layer represents the crumb\r\nof a loaf, the rest of the bean being the crust.\r\n\r\nIn the pea, a sphere of much less capacity, it occupies the central\r\nportion; a limited point at which the grub develops, and lacking which\r\nit perishes; but in the bean it lines the wide adjoining faces of the\r\ntwo flattened cotyledons. No matter where the point of attack is made,\r\nthe grub has only to bore straight down when it quickly reaches the\r\nsofter tissues. What is the result? I have counted the eggs adhering to\r\na bean-pod and the beans included in the pod, and comparing the two\r\nfigures I find that there is plenty of room for the whole family at the\r\nrate of five or six dwellers in each bean. No superfluous larvæ perish\r\nof hunger when barely issued from the egg; all have their share of the\r\nample provision; all live and prosper. The abundance of food balances\r\nthe prodigal fertility of the mother.\r\n\r\nIf the Bruchus were always to adopt the broad bean for the establishment\r\nof her family I could well understand the exuberant allowance of eggs to\r\none pod; a rich food-stuff easily obtained evokes a large batch of\r\neggs. But the case of the pea perplexes me. By what aberration does the\r\nmother abandon her children to starvation on this totally insufficient\r\nvegetable? Why so many grubs to each pea when one pea is sufficient only\r\nfor one grub?\r\n\r\nMatters are not so arranged in the general balance-sheet of life. A\r\ncertain foresight seems to rule over the ovary so that the number of\r\nmouths is in proportion to the abundance or scarcity of the food\r\nconsumed. The Scarabæus, the Sphex, the Necrophorus, and other insects\r\nwhich prepare and preserve alimentary provision for their families, are\r\nall of a narrowly limited fertility, because the balls of dung, the dead\r\nor paralysed insects, or the buried corpses of animals on which their\r\noffspring are nourished are provided only at the cost of laborious\r\nefforts.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary bluebottle, on the contrary, which lays her eggs upon\r\nbutcher's meat or carrion, lays them in enormous batches. Trusting in\r\nthe inexhaustible riches represented by the corpse, she is prodigal of\r\noffspring, and takes no account of numbers. In other cases the provision\r\nis acquired by audacious brigandage, which exposes the newly born\r\noffspring to a thousand mortal accidents. In such cases the mother\r\nbalances the chances of destruction by an exaggerated flux of eggs. Such\r\nis the case with the Meloides, which, stealing the goods of others under\r\nconditions of the greatest peril, are accordingly endowed with a\r\nprodigious fertility.\r\n\r\nThe Bruchus knows neither the fatigues of the laborious, obliged to\r\nlimit the size of her family, nor the misfortunes of the parasite,\r\nobliged to produce an exaggerated number of offspring. Without painful\r\nsearch, entirely at her ease, merely moving in the sunshine over her\r\nfavourite plant, she can ensure a sufficient provision for each of her\r\noffspring; she can do so, yet is foolish enough to over-populate the pod\r\nof the pea; a nursery insufficiently provided, in which the great\r\nmajority will perish of starvation. This ineptitude is a thing I cannot\r\nunderstand: it clashes too completely with the habitual foresight of the\r\nmaternal instinct.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe that the pea is not the original food plant of\r\nthe Bruchus. The original plant must rather have been the bean, one seed\r\nof which is capable of supporting half a dozen or more larvæ. With the\r\nlarger cotyledon the crying disproportion between the number of eggs and\r\nthe available provision disappears.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it is indubitable that the bean is of earlier date than the\r\npea. Its exceptional size and its agreeable flavour would certainly have\r\nattracted the attention of man from the remotest periods. The bean is a\r\nready-made mouthful, and would be of the greatest value to the hungry\r\ntribe. Primitive man would at an early date have sown it beside his\r\nwattled hut. Coming from Central Asia by long stages, their wagons drawn\r\nby shaggy oxen and rolling on the circular discs cut from the trunks of\r\ntrees, the early immigrants would have brought to our virgin land, first\r\nthe bean, then the pea, and finally the cereal, that best of safeguards\r\nagainst famine. They taught us the care of herds, and the use of bronze,\r\nthe material of the first metal implement. Thus the dawn of civilisation\r\narose over France. With the bean did those ancient teachers also\r\ninvoluntarily bring us the insect which to-day disputes it with us? It\r\nis doubtful; the Bruchidæ seem to be indigenous. At all events, I find\r\nthem levying tribute from various indigenous plants, wild vegetables\r\nwhich have never tempted the appetite of man. They abound in particular\r\nupon the great forest vetch (_Lathyrus latifolius_), with its\r\nmagnificent heads of flowers and long handsome pods. The seeds are not\r\nlarge, being indeed smaller than the garden pea; but eaten to the very\r\nskin, as they invariably are, each is sufficient to the needs of its\r\ngrub.\r\n\r\nWe must not fail to note their number. I have counted more than twenty\r\nin a single pod, a number unknown in the case of the pea, even in the\r\nmost prolific varieties. Consequently this superb vetch is in general\r\nable to nourish without much loss the family confided to its pod.\r\n\r\nWhere the forest vetch is lacking, the Bruchus, none the less, bestows\r\nits habitual prodigality of eggs upon another vegetable of similar\r\nflavour, but incapable of nourishing all the grubs: for the example, the\r\ntravelling vetch (_Vicia peregrina_) or the cultivated vetch (_Vicia\r\nsativa_). The number of eggs remains high even upon insufficient pods,\r\nbecause the original food-plant offered a copious provision, both in the\r\nmultiplicity and the size of the seeds. If the Bruchus is really a\r\nstranger, let us regard the bean as the original food-plant; if\r\nindigenous, the large vetch.\r\n\r\nSometime in the remote past we received the pea, growing it at first in\r\nthe prehistoric vegetable garden which already supplied the bean. It was\r\nfound a better article of diet than the broad bean, which to-day, after\r\nsuch good service, is comparatively neglected. The weevil was of the\r\nsame opinion as man, and without entirely forgetting the bean and the\r\nvetch it established the greater part of its tribe upon the pea, which\r\nfrom century to century was more widely cultivated. To-day we have to\r\nshare our peas: the Bruchidæ take what they need, and bestow their\r\nleavings on us.\r\n\r\nThis prosperity of the insect which is the offspring of the abundance\r\nand quality of our garden products is from another point of view\r\nequivalent to decadence. For the weevil, as for ourselves, progress in\r\nmatters of food and drink is not always beneficial. The race would\r\nprofit better if it remained frugal. On the bean and the vetch the\r\nBruchus founded colonies in which the infant mortality was low. There\r\nwas room for all. On the pea-vine, delicious though its fruits may be,\r\nthe greater part of its offspring die of starvation. The rations are\r\nfew, and the hungry mouths are multitudinous.\r\n\r\nWe will linger over this problem no longer. Let us observe the grub\r\nwhich has now become the sole tenant of the pea by the death of its\r\nbrothers. It has had no part in their death; chance has favoured it,\r\nthat is all. In the centre of the pea, a wealthy solitude, it performs\r\nthe duty of a grub; the sole duty of eating. It nibbles the walls\r\nenclosing it, enlarging its lodgment, which is always entirely filled by\r\nits corpulent body. It is well shaped, fat, and shining with health. If\r\nI disturb it, it turns gently in its niche and sways its head. This is\r\nits manner of complaining of my importunities. Let us leave it in peace.\r\n\r\nIt profits so greatly and so swiftly by its position that by the time\r\nthe dog-days have come it is already preparing for its approaching\r\nliberation. The adult is not sufficiently well equipped to open for\r\nitself a way out through the pea, which is now completely hardened. The\r\nlarva knows of this future helplessness, and with consummate art\r\nprovides for its release. With its powerful mandibles it bores a channel\r\nof exit, exactly round, with extremely clean-cut sides. The most skilful\r\nivory-carver could do no better.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the door of exit in advance is not enough; the grub must also\r\nprovide for the tranquillity essential to the delicate processes of\r\nnymphosis. An intruder might enter by the open door and injure the\r\nhelpless nymph. This passage must therefore remain closed. But how?\r\n\r\nAs the grub bores the passage of exit it consumes the farinaceous matter\r\nwithout leaving a crumb. Having come to the skin of the pea it stops\r\nshort. This membrane, semi-translucid, is the door to the chamber of\r\nmetamorphosis, its protection against the evil intentions of external\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\nIt is also the only obstacle which the adult will encounter at the\r\nmoment of exit. To lessen the difficulty of opening it the grub takes\r\nthe precaution of gnawing at the inner side of the skin, all round the\r\ncircumference, so as to make a line of least resistance. The perfect\r\ninsect will only have to heave with its shoulder and strike a few blows\r\nwith its head in order to raise the circular door and knock it off like\r\nthe lid of a box. The passage of exit shows through the diaphanous skin\r\nof the pea as a large circular spot, which is darkened by the obscurity\r\nof the interior. What passes behind it is invisible, hidden as it is\r\nbehind a sort of ground glass window.\r\n\r\nA pretty invention, this little closed porthole, this barricade against\r\nthe invader, this trap-door raised by a push when the time has come for\r\nthe hermit to enter the world. Shall we credit it to the Bruchus? Did\r\nthe ingenious insect conceive the undertaking? Did it think out a plan\r\nand work out a scheme of its own devising? This would be no small\r\ntriumph for the brain of a weevil. Before coming to a conclusion let us\r\ntry an experiment.\r\n\r\nI deprive certain occupied peas of their skin, and I dry them with\r\nabnormal rapidity, placing them in glass test-tubes. The grubs prosper\r\nas well as in the intact peas. At the proper time the preparations for\r\nemergence are made.\r\n\r\nIf the grub acts on its own inspiration, if it ceases to prolong its\r\nboring directly it recognises that the outer coating, auscultated from\r\ntime to time, is sufficiently thin, what will it do under the conditions\r\nof the present test? Feeling itself at the requisite distance from the\r\nsurface it will stop boring; it will respect the outer layer of the bare\r\npea, and will thus obtain the indispensable protecting screen.\r\n\r\nNothing of the kind occurs. In every case the passage is completely\r\nexcavated; the entrance gapes wide open, as large and as carefully\r\nexecuted as though the skin of the pea were in its place. Reasons of\r\nsecurity have failed to modify the usual method of work. This open\r\nlodging has no defence against the enemy; but the grub exhibits no\r\nanxiety on this score.\r\n\r\nNeither is it thinking of the outer enemy when it bores down to the skin\r\nwhen the pea is intact, and then stops short. It suddenly stops because\r\nthe innutritious skin is not to its taste. We ourselves remove the\r\nparchment-like skins from a mess of pease-pudding, as from a culinary\r\npoint of view they are so much waste matter. The larva of the Bruchus,\r\nlike ourselves, dislikes the skin of the pea. It stops short at the\r\nhorny covering, simply because it is checked by an uneatable substance.\r\nFrom this aversion a little miracle arises; but the insect has no sense\r\nof logic; it is passively obedient to the superior logic of facts. It\r\nobeys its instinct, as unconscious of its act as is a crystal when it\r\nassembles, in exquisite order, its battalions of atoms.\r\n\r\nSooner or later during the month of August we see a shadowy circle form\r\non each inhabited pea; but only one on each seed. These circles of\r\nshadow mark the doors of exit. Most of them open in September. The lid,\r\nas though cut out with a punch, detaches itself cleanly and falls to the\r\nground, leaving the orifice free. The Bruchus emerges, freshly clad, in\r\nits final form.\r\n\r\nThe weather is delightful. Flowers are abundant, awakened by the summer\r\nshowers; and the weevils visit them in the lovely autumn weather. Then,\r\nwhen the cold sets in, they take up their winter quarters in any\r\nsuitable retreat. Others, still numerous, are less hasty in quitting the\r\nnative seed. They remain within during the whole winter, sheltered\r\nbehind the trap-door, which they take care not to touch. The door of the\r\ncell will not open on its hinges, or, to be exact, will not yield along\r\nthe line of least resistance, until the warm days return. Then the late\r\narrivals will leave their shelter and rejoin the more impatient, and\r\nboth will be ready for work when the pea-vines are in flower.\r\n\r\nTo take a general view of the instincts in their inexhaustible variety\r\nis, for the observer, the great attraction of the entomological world;\r\nfor nowhere do we gain a clearer sight of the wonderful way in which the\r\nprocesses of life are ordered. Thus regarded entomology is not, I know,\r\nto the taste of everybody; the simple creature absorbed in the doings\r\nand habits of insects is held in low esteem. To the terrible\r\nutilitarian, a bushel of peas preserved from the weevil is of more\r\nimportance than a volume of observations which bring no immediate\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nYet who has told you, O man of little faith, that what is useless to-day\r\nwill not be useful to-morrow? If we learn the customs of insects or\r\nanimals we shall understand better how to protect our goods. Do not\r\ndespise disinterested knowledge, or you may rue the day. It is by the\r\naccumulation of ideas, whether immediately applicable or otherwise, that\r\nhumanity has done, and will continue to do, better to-day than\r\nyesterday, and better to-morrow than to-day. If we live on peas and\r\nbeans, which we dispute with the weevil, we also live by knowledge, that\r\nmighty kneading-trough in which the bread of progress is mixed and\r\nleavened. Knowledge is well worth a few beans.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, knowledge tells us: \"The seedsman need not go to the\r\nexpense of waging war upon the weevil. When the peas arrive in the\r\ngranary, the harm is already done; it is irreparable, but not\r\ntransmissible. The untouched peas have nothing to fear from the\r\nneighbourhood of those which have been attacked, however long the\r\nmixture is left. From the latter the weevils will issue when their time\r\nhas come; they will fly away from the storehouse if escape is possible;\r\nif not, they will perish without in any way attacking the sound peas. No\r\neggs, no new generation will ever be seen upon or within the dried peas\r\nin the storehouse; there the adult weevil can work no further mischief.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bruchus is not a sedentary inhabitant of granaries: it requires the\r\nopen air, the sun, the liberty of the fields. Frugal in everything, it\r\nabsolutely disdains the hard tissues of the vegetable; its tiny mouth is\r\ncontent with a few honeyed mouthfuls, enjoyed upon the flowers. The\r\nlarvæ, on the other hand, require the tender tissues of the green pea\r\ngrowing in the pod. For these reasons the granary knows no final\r\nmultiplication on the part of the despoiler.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the evil is in the kitchen-garden. It is there that we\r\nought to keep a watch on the misdeeds of the Bruchus, were it not for\r\nthe fact that we are nearly always weaponless when it comes to fighting\r\nan insect. Indestructible by reason of its numbers, its small size, and\r\nits cunning, the little creature laughs at the anger of man. The\r\ngardener curses it, but the weevil is not disturbed: it imperturbably\r\ncontinues its trade of levying tribute. Happily we have assistants more\r\npatient and more clear-sighted than ourselves.\r\n\r\nDuring the first week of August, when the mature Bruchus begins to\r\nemerge, I notice a little Chalcidian, the protector of our peas. In my\r\nrearing-cages it issues under my eyes in abundance from the peas\r\ninfested by the grub of the weevil. The female has a reddish head and\r\nthorax; the abdomen is black, with a long augur-like oviscapt. The male,\r\na little smaller, is black. Both sexes have reddish claws and\r\nthread-like antennæ.\r\n\r\nIn order to escape from the pea the slayer of the weevil makes an\r\nopening in the centre of the circular trap-door which the grub of the\r\nweevil prepared in view of its future deliverance. The slain has\r\nprepared the way for the slayer. After this detail the rest may be\r\ndivined.\r\n\r\nWhen the preliminaries to the metamorphosis are completed, when the\r\npassage of escape is bored and furnished with its lid of superficial\r\nmembrane, the female Chalcidian arrives in a busy mood. She inspects the\r\npeas, still on the vine, and enclosed in their pods; she auscultates\r\nthem with her antennæ; she discovers, hidden under the general envelope,\r\nthe weak points in the epidermic covering of the peas. Then, applying\r\nher oviscapt, she thrusts it through the side of the pod and perforates\r\nthe circular trap-door. However far withdrawn into the centre of the\r\npea, the Bruchus, whether larvæ or nymph, is reached by the long\r\noviduct. It receives an egg in its tender flesh, and the thing is done.\r\nWithout possibility of defence, since it is by now a somnolent grub or a\r\nhelpless pupa, the embryo weevil is eaten until nothing but skin\r\nremains. What a pity that we cannot at will assist the multiplication of\r\nthis eager exterminator! Alas! our assistants have got us in a vicious\r\ncircle, for if we wished to obtain the help of any great number of\r\nChalcidians we should be obliged in the first place to breed a\r\nmultiplicity of Bruchidæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nAN INVADER.--THE HARICOT-WEEVIL\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there is one vegetable on earth that more than any other is a gift of\r\nthe gods, it is the haricot bean. It has all the virtues: it forms a\r\nsoft paste upon the tongue; it is extremely palatable, abundant,\r\ninexpensive, and highly nutritious. It is a vegetable meat which,\r\nwithout being bloody and repulsive, is the equivalent of the horrors\r\noutspread upon the butcher's slab. To recall its services the more\r\nemphatically, the Provençal idiom calls it the _gounflo-gus_--the filler\r\nof the poor.\r\n\r\nBlessed Bean, consoler of the wretched, right well indeed do you fill\r\nthe labourer, the honest, skilful worker who has drawn a low number in\r\nthe crazy lottery of life. Kindly Haricot, with three drops of oil and a\r\ndash of vinegar you were the favourite dish of my young years; and even\r\nnow, in the evening of my days, you are welcome to my humble porringer.\r\nWe shall be friends to the last.\r\n\r\nTo-day it is not my intention to sing your merits; I wish simply to ask\r\nyou a question, being curious: What is the country of your origin? Did\r\nyou come from Central Asia with the broad bean and the pea? Did you make\r\npart of that collection of seeds which the first pioneers of culture\r\nbrought us from their gardens? Were you known to antiquity?\r\n\r\nHere the insect, an impartial and well-informed witness, answers: \"No;\r\nin our country antiquity was not acquainted with the haricot. The\r\nprecious vegetable came hither by the same road as the broad bean. It is\r\na foreigner, and of comparatively recent introduction into Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply of the insect merits serious examination, supported as it is\r\nby extremely plausible arguments. Here are the facts. For years\r\nattentive to matters agricultural, I had never seen haricots attacked by\r\nany insect whatever; not even by the Bruchidæ, the licensed robbers of\r\nleguminous seeds.\r\n\r\nOn this point I have questioned my peasant neighbours. They are men of\r\nthe extremest vigilance in all that concerns their crops. To steal their\r\nproperty is an abominable crime, swiftly discovered. Moreover, the\r\nhousewife, who individually examines all beans intended for the\r\nsaucepan, would inevitably find the malefactor.\r\n\r\nAll those I have spoken to replied to my questions with a smile in which\r\nI read their lack of faith in my knowledge of insects. \"Sir,\" they said,\r\n\"you must know that there are never grubs in the haricot bean. It is a\r\nblessed vegetable, respected by the weevil. The pea, the broad bean, the\r\nvetch, and the chick-pea all have their vermin; but the haricot, _lou\r\ngounflo-gus_, never. What should we do, poor folk as we are, if the\r\n_Courcoussoun_ robbed us of it?\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the weevil despises the haricot; a very curious dislike\r\nif we consider how industriously the other vegetables of the same family\r\nare attacked. All, even the beggarly lentil, are eagerly exploited;\r\nwhilst the haricot, so tempting both as to size and flavour, remains\r\nuntouched. It is incomprehensible. Why should the Bruchus, which without\r\nhesitation passes from the excellent to the indifferent, and from the\r\nindifferent to the excellent, disdain this particularly toothsome seed?\r\nIt leaves the forest vetch for the pea, and the pea for the broad bean,\r\nas pleased with the small as with the large, yet the temptations of the\r\nharicot bean leave it indifferent. Why?\r\n\r\nApparently because the haricot is unknown to it. The other leguminous\r\nplants, whether native or of Oriental origin, have been familiar to it\r\nfor centuries; it has tested their virtues year by year, and, confiding\r\nin the lessons of the past, it bases its forethought for the future upon\r\nancient custom. The haricot is avoided as a newcomer, whose merits it\r\nhas not yet learned.\r\n\r\nThe insect emphatically informs us that with us the haricot is of recent\r\ndate. It has come to us from a distant country: and assuredly from the\r\nNew World. Every edible vegetable attracts its consumers. If it had\r\noriginated in the Old World the haricot would have had its licensed\r\nconsumers, as have the pea, the lentil, and the broad bean. The smallest\r\nleguminous seed, if barely bigger than a pin's head, nourishes its\r\nweevil; a dwarf which patiently nibbles it and excavates a dwelling; but\r\nthe plump, delicious haricot is spared.\r\n\r\nThis astonishing immunity can have only one explanation: like the potato\r\nand the maize-plant, the haricot is a gift of the New World. It arrived\r\nin Europe without the company of the insect which exploits it in its\r\nnative country; it has found in our fields another world of insects,\r\nwhich have despised it because they did not know it. Similarly the\r\npotato and the ear of maize are untouched in France unless their\r\nAmerican consumers are accidentally imported with them.\r\n\r\nThe verdict of the insect is confirmed by the negative testimony of the\r\nancient classics; the haricot never appears on the table of the Greek or\r\nRoman peasant. In the second Eclogue of Virgil Thestylis prepares the\r\nrepast of the harvesters:--\r\n\r\n  Thestylis et rapido fessis messoribus æstu\r\n  Allia serpyllumque herbas contundit olentes.\r\n\r\nThis mixture is the equivalent of the _aïoli_, dear to the Provençal\r\npalate. It sounds very well in verse, but is not very substantial. On\r\nsuch an occasion men would look for that fundamental dish, the plate of\r\nred haricots, seasoned with chopped onions. All in good time; this at\r\nleast would ballast the stomach. Thus refreshed in the open air,\r\nlistening to the song of the cigales, the gang of harvesters would take\r\ntheir mid-day rest and gently digest their meal in the shadows of the\r\nsheaves. Our modern Thestylis, differing little from her classic sister,\r\nwould take good care not to forget the _gounflo-gus_, that economical\r\nresource of large appetites. The Thestylis of the past did not think of\r\nproviding it because she did not know it.\r\n\r\nThe same author shows us Tityrus offering a night's hospitality to his\r\nfriend Meliboeus, who has been driven from his property by the\r\nsoldiers of Octavius, and goes limping behind his flock of goats. We\r\nshall have, says Tityrus, chestnuts, cheese, and fruits. History does\r\nnot say if Meliboeus allowed himself to be tempted. It is a pity; for\r\nduring the frugal meal we might have learned in a more explicit fashion\r\nthat the shepherds of the ancient world were not acquainted with the\r\nharicot.\r\n\r\nOvid tells us, in a delightful passage, of the manner in which Philemon\r\nand Baucis received the gods unawares as guests in their humble cottage.\r\nOn the three-legged table, which was levelled by means of a potsherd\r\nunder one of the legs, they served cabbage soup, rusty bacon, eggs\r\npoached for a minute in the hot cinders, cornel-berries pickled in\r\nbrine, honey, and fruits. In this rustic abundance one dish was lacking;\r\nan essential dish, which the Baucis of our countryside would never\r\nforget. After bacon soup would follow the obligatory plate of haricots.\r\nWhy did Ovid, so prodigal of detail, neglect to mention a dish so\r\nappropriate to the occasion? The reply is the same as before: because he\r\ndid not know of it.\r\n\r\nIn vain have I recapitulated all that my reading has taught me\r\nconcerning the rustic dietary of ancient times; I can recollect no\r\nmention of the haricot. The worker in the vineyard and the harvester\r\nhave their lupins, broad beans, peas, and lentils, but never the bean of\r\nbeans, the haricot.\r\n\r\nThe haricot has a reputation of another kind. It is a source of\r\nflatulence; you eat it, as the saying is, and then you take a walk. It\r\nlends itself to the gross pleasantries loved of the populace; especially\r\nwhen they are formulated by the shameless genius of an Aristophanes or a\r\nPlautus. What merriment over a simple allusion to the sonorous bean,\r\nwhat guffaws from the throats of Athenian sailors or Roman porters! Did\r\nthe two masters, in the unfettered gaiety of a language less reserved\r\nthan our own, ever mention the virtues of the haricot? No; they are\r\nabsolutely silent concerning the trumpet-voiced vegetable.\r\n\r\nThe name of the bean is a matter for reflection. It is of an unfamiliar\r\nsound, having no affinity with our language. By its unlikeness to our\r\nnative combinations of sounds, it makes one think of the West Indies or\r\nSouth America, as do _caoutchouc_ and _cacao_. Does the word as a matter\r\nof fact come from the American Indians? Did we receive, together with\r\nthe vegetable, the name by which it is known in its native country?\r\nPerhaps; but how are we to know? Haricot, fantastic haricot, you set us\r\na curious philological problem.\r\n\r\nIt is also known in French as _faséole_, or _flageolet_. The Provençal\r\ncalls it _faioù_ and _favioù_; the Catalan, _fayol_; the Spaniard,\r\n_faseolo_; the Portuguese, _feyâo_; the Italian, _fagiuolo_. Here I am\r\non familiar ground: the languages of the Latin family have preserved,\r\nwith the inevitable modifications, the ancient word _faseolus_.\r\n\r\nNow, if I consult my dictionary I find: _faselus_, _faseolus_,\r\n_phaseolus_, haricot. Learned lexicographer, permit me to remark that\r\nyour translation is incorrect: _faselus_, _faseolus_ cannot mean\r\nharicot. The incontestable proof is in the Georgics, where Virgil tells\r\nus at what season we must sow the _faselus_. He says:--\r\n\r\n  Si vero viciamque seres vilemque faselum ...\r\n  Haud obscura cadens mittet tibi signa Bootes;\r\n  Incipe, et ad medias sementem extende pruinas.\r\n\r\nNothing is clearer than the precept of the poet who was so admirably\r\nfamiliar with all matters agricultural; the sowing of the _faselus_ must\r\nbe commenced when the constellation of Bootes disappears at the set of\r\nsun, that is, in October; and it is to be continued until the middle of\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\nThese conditions put the haricot out of the running: it is a delicate\r\nplant, which would never survive the lightest frost. Winter would be\r\nfatal to it, even under Italian skies. More refractory to cold on\r\naccount of the country of their origin, peas, broad beans, and vetches,\r\nand other leguminous plants have nothing to fear from an autumn sowing,\r\nand prosper during the winter provided the climate be fairly mild.\r\n\r\nWhat then is represented by the _faselus_ of the Georgics, that\r\nproblematical vegetable which has transmitted its name to the haricot in\r\nthe Latin tongues? Remembering that the contemptuous epithet _vilis_ is\r\nused by the poet in qualification, I am strongly inclined to regard it\r\nas the cultivated vetch, the big square pea, the little-valued _jaïsso_\r\nof the Provençal peasant.\r\n\r\nThe problem of the haricot stood thus, almost elucidated by the\r\ntestimony of the insect world alone, when an unexpected witness gave me\r\nthe last word of the enigma. It was once again a poet, and a famous\r\npoet, M. José-Maria de Heredia, who came to the aid of the naturalist.\r\nWithout suspecting the service he was rendering, a friend of mine, the\r\nvillage schoolmaster, lent me a magazine[9] in which I read the\r\nfollowing conversation between the master-sonneteer and a lady\r\njournalist, who was anxious to know which of his own works he preferred.\r\n\r\n\"What would you have me say?\" said the poet.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what to say, I do not know which sonnet I prefer; I have\r\ntaken horrible pains with all of them.... But you, which do you prefer?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear master, how can I choose out of so many jewels, when each one\r\nis perfect in its beauty? You flash pearls, emeralds, and rubies before\r\nmy astonished eyes: how should I decide to prefer the emerald to the\r\npearl? I am transported by admiration of the whole necklace.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, as for me, there is something I am more proud of than of all my\r\nsonnets, and which has done much more for my reputation than my verses.\"\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes wide, \"What is that?\" I asked. The master looked at me\r\nmischievously; then, with that beautiful light in his eyes which fires\r\nhis youthful countenance, he said triumphantly--\r\n\r\n\"It is my discovery of the etymology of the word haricot!\"\r\n\r\nI was so amazed that I forgot to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"I am perfectly serious in telling you this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, my dear master, of your reputation for profound scholarship:\r\nbut to imagine, on that account, that you were famed for your discovery\r\nof the etymology of haricot--I should never have expected it! Will you\r\ntell me how you made the discovery?\"\r\n\r\n\"Willingly. See now: I found some information respecting the haricot\r\nwhile studying that fine seventeenth-century work of natural history by\r\nHernandez: _De Historia plantarum novi orbis_. The word haricot was\r\nunknown in France until the seventeenth century: people used the word\r\n_feve_ or _phaséol_: in Mexican, _ayacot_. Thirty species of haricot\r\nwere cultivated in Mexico before the conquest. They are still known as\r\n_ayacot_, especially the red haricot, spotted with black or violet. One\r\nday at the house of Gaston Paris I met a famous scholar. Hearing my\r\nname, he rushed at me and asked if it was I who had discovered the\r\netymology of the word haricot. He was absolutely ignorant of the fact\r\nthat I had written verses and published the _Trophées_.\"--\r\n\r\nA very pretty whim, to count the jewellery of his famous sonnets as\r\nsecond in importance to the nomenclature of a vegetable! I in my turn\r\nwas delighted with his _ayacot_. How right I was to suspect the\r\noutlandish word of American Indian origin! How right the insect was, in\r\ntestifying, in its own fashion, that the precious bean came to us from\r\nthe New World! While still retaining its original name--or something\r\nsufficiently like it--the bean of Montezuma, the Aztec _ayacot_, has\r\nmigrated from Mexico to the kitchen-gardens of Europe.\r\n\r\nBut it has reached us without the company of its licensed consumer; for\r\nthere must assuredly be a weevil in its native country which levies\r\ntribute on its nourishing tissues. Our native bean-eaters have mistaken\r\nthe stranger; they have not had time as yet to grow familiar with it, or\r\nto appreciate its merits; they have prudently abstained from touching\r\nthe _ayacot_, whose novelty awoke suspicion. Until our own days the\r\nMexican bean remained untouched: unlike our other leguminous seeds,\r\nwhich are all eagerly exploited by the weevil.\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs could not last. If our own fields do not contain\r\nthe insect amateur of the haricot the New World knows it well enough. By\r\nthe road of commercial exchange, sooner or later some worm-eaten sack\r\nof haricots must bring it to Europe. The invasion is inevitable.\r\n\r\nAccording to documents now before me, indeed, it has already taken\r\nplace. Three or four years ago I received from Maillane, in the\r\nBouches-du-Rhône, what I sought in vain in my own neighbourhood,\r\nalthough I questioned many a farmer and housewife, and astonished them\r\nby my questions. No one had ever seen the pest of the haricot; no one\r\nhad ever heard of it. Friends who knew of my inquiries sent me from\r\nMaillane, as I have said, information that gave great satisfaction to my\r\nnaturalist's curiosity. It was accompanied by a measure of haricots\r\nwhich were utterly and outrageously spoiled; every bean was riddled with\r\nholes, changed into a kind of sponge. Within them swarmed innumerable\r\nweevils, which recalled, by their diminutive size, the lentil-weevil,\r\n_Bruchus lenti_.\r\n\r\nThe senders told me of the loss experienced at Maillane. The odious\r\nlittle creature, they said, had destroyed the greater portion of the\r\nharvest. A veritable plague, such as had never before been known, had\r\nfallen upon the haricots, leaving the housewife barely a handful to put\r\nin the saucepan. Of the habits of the creature and its way of going to\r\nwork nothing was known. It was for me to discover them by means of\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nQuick, then, let us experiment! The circumstances favour me. We are in\r\nthe middle of June, and in my garden there is a bed of early haricots;\r\nthe black Belgian haricots, sown for use in the kitchen. Since I must\r\nsacrifice the toothsome vegetable, let us loose the terrible destroyer\r\non the mass of verdure. The development of the plant is at the\r\nrequisite stage, if I may go by what the _Bruchus pisi_ has already\r\ntaught me; the flowers are abundant, and the pods are equally so; still\r\ngreen, and of all sizes.\r\n\r\nI place on a plate two or three handfuls of the infested haricots, and\r\nset the populous heap in the full sunlight by the edge of my bed of\r\nbeans. I can imagine what will happen. Those insects which are already\r\nfree, and those which the stimulus of the sunshine will presently\r\nliberate, will emerge and take to their wings. Finding the maternal\r\nharicot close at hand they will take possession of the vines. I shall\r\nsee them exploring pods and flowers, and before very long they will lay\r\ntheir eggs. That is how the pea-weevil would behave under similar\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nBut no: to my surprise and confusion, matters do not fall out as I\r\nforesaw. For a few minutes the insects bustle about in the sunlight,\r\nopening and closing their wing-covers to ease the mechanism of flight;\r\nthen one by one they fly away, mounting in the luminous air; they grow\r\nsmaller and smaller to the sight, and are quickly lost to view. My\r\npersevering attentions have not met with the slightest success; not one\r\nof the weevils has settled on my haricots.\r\n\r\nWhen the joys of liberty have been tasted will they return--to-night,\r\nto-morrow, or later? No, they do not return. All that week, at\r\nfavourable hours, I inspect the rows of beans pod by pod, flower by\r\nflower; but never a Bruchus do I see, nor even an egg. Yet the season is\r\npropitious, for at this very moment the mothers imprisoned in my jars\r\nlay a profusion of eggs upon the dry haricots.\r\n\r\nNext season I try again. I have at my disposal two other beds, which I\r\nhave sown with the late haricot, the red haricot; partly for the use of\r\nthe household, but principally for the benefit of the weevil. Arranged\r\nin convenient rows, the two crops will be ready, one in August and one\r\nin September or later.\r\n\r\nWith the red haricot I repeat the experiment already essayed with the\r\nblack haricot. On several occasions, in suitable weather, I release\r\nlarge numbers of weevils from my glass jars, the general headquarters of\r\nthe tribe. On each occasion the result is plainly negative. All through\r\nthe season, until both crops are exhausted, I repeat my search almost\r\ndaily; but I can never discover a single pod infested, nor even a single\r\nweevil perching on leaf or flower.\r\n\r\nCertainly the inspection has not been at fault. The household is warned\r\nto respect certain rows of beans which I have reserved for myself. It is\r\nalso requested to keep a look-out for eggs on all the pods gathered. I\r\nmyself examine with a magnifying-glass all the haricots coming from my\r\nown or from neighbouring gardens before handing them over to the\r\nhousewife to be shelled. All my trouble is wasted: there is not an egg\r\nto be seen.\r\n\r\nTo these experiments in the open air I add others performed under glass.\r\nI place, in some tall, narrow bottles, fresh haricot pods hanging from\r\ntheir stems; some green, others mottled with crimson, and containing\r\nseeds not far from mature. Each bottle is finally given a population of\r\nweevils. This time I obtain some eggs, but I am no further advanced;\r\nthey are laid on the sides of the bottles, but not on the pods.\r\nNevertheless, they hatch. For a few days I see the grubs wandering\r\nabout, exploring the pods and the glass with equal zeal. Finally one\r\nand all perish without touching the food provided.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion to be drawn from these facts is obvious: the young and\r\ntender haricot is not the proper diet. Unlike the _Bruchus pisi_, the\r\nfemale of the haricot-weevil refuses to trust her family to beans that\r\nare not hardened by age and desiccation; she refused to settle on my\r\nbean-patch because the food she required was not to be found there. What\r\ndoes she require? Evidently the mature, dry, hard haricot, which falls\r\nto earth with the sound of a small pebble. I hasten to satisfy her. I\r\nplace in the bottles some very mature, horny pods, thoroughly desiccated\r\nby exposure to the sun. This time the family prospers, the grubs\r\nperforate the dry shell, reach the beans, penetrate them, and henceforth\r\nall goes well.\r\n\r\nTo judge by appearances, then, the weevil invades the granary. The beans\r\nare left standing in the fields until both plants and pods, shrivelled\r\nby the sun, are completely desiccated. The process of beating the pods\r\nto loosen and separate the beans is thus greatly facilitated. It is then\r\nthat the weevil, finding matters to suit her, commences to lay her eggs.\r\nBy storing his crop a little late the peasant stores the pest as well.\r\n\r\nBut the weevil more especially attacks the haricot when warehoused. Like\r\nthe Calander-beetle, which nibbles the wheat in our granaries but\r\ndespises the cereal while still on the stalk, it abhors the bean while\r\ntender, and prefers to establish itself in the peace and darkness of the\r\nstorehouse. It is a formidable enemy to the merchant rather than to the\r\npeasant.\r\n\r\nWhat a fury of destruction once the ravager is installed in the\r\nvegetable treasure-house! My bottles give abundant evidence of this. One\r\nsingle haricot bean shelters a numerous family; often as many as twenty\r\nmembers. And not one generation only exploits the bean, but three or\r\nfour in the year. So long as the skin of the bean contains any edible\r\nmatter, so long do new consumers establish themselves within it, so that\r\nthe haricot finally becomes a mere shell stuffed with excreta. The skin,\r\ndespised by the grubs, is a mere sac, pierced with holes as many as the\r\ninhabitants that have deserted it; the ruin is complete.\r\n\r\nThe _Bruchus pisi_, a solitary hermit, consumes only so much of the pea\r\nas will leave a cell for the nymph; the rest remains intact, so that the\r\npea may be sown, or it will even serve as food, if we can overcome our\r\nrepugnance. The American insect knows nothing of these limitations; it\r\nempties the haricot completely and leaves a skinful of filth that I have\r\nseen the pigs refuse. America is anything but considerate when she sends\r\nus her entomological pests. We owe the Phylloxera to America; the\r\nPhylloxera, that calamitous insect against which our vine-growers wage\r\nincessant war: and to-day she is sending us the haricot-weevil, which\r\nthreatens to be a plague of the future. A few experiments gave me some\r\nidea of the peril of such an invasion.\r\n\r\nFor nearly three years there have stood, on my laboratory table, some\r\ndozens of jars and bottles covered with pieces of gauze which prevent\r\nescape while permitting of a constant ventilation. These are the cages\r\nof my menagerie. In them I rear the haricot-weevil, varying the system\r\nof education at will. Amongst other things I have learned that this\r\ninsect, far from being exclusive in its choice, will accommodate itself\r\nto most of our leguminous foods.\r\n\r\nAll the haricots suit it, black and white, red and variegated, large and\r\nsmall; those of the latest crop and those which have been many years in\r\nstock and are almost completely refractory to boiling water. The loose\r\nbeans are attacked by preference, as being easier to invade, but when\r\nthe loose beans are not available those in the natural shelter of their\r\npods are attacked with equal zest. However dry and parchment-like the\r\npods, the grubs have no difficulty in attaining the seeds. When attacked\r\nin the field or garden, the bean is attacked in this way through the\r\npod. The bean known in Provence as the blind haricot--_lou faioù\r\nborgné_--a bean with a long pod, which is marked with a black spot at\r\nthe navel, which has the look of a closed and blackened eye, is also\r\ngreatly appreciated; indeed, I fancy my little guests show an obvious\r\npreference for this particular bean.\r\n\r\nSo far, nothing abnormal; the Bruchus does not wander beyond the limits\r\nof the botanical family _Phaseolus_. But here is a characteristic that\r\nincreases the peril, and shows us this lover of beans in an unexpected\r\nlight. Without the slightest hesitation it accepts the dry pea, the\r\nbean, the vetch, the tare, and the chick-pea; it goes from one to the\r\nother, always satisfied; its offspring live and prosper in all these\r\nseeds as well as in the haricot. Only the lentil is refused, perhaps on\r\naccount of its insufficient volume. The American weevil is a formidable\r\nexperimentalist.\r\n\r\nThe peril would be much greater did the insect pass from leguminous\r\nseeds to cereals, as at first I feared it might. But it does not do so;\r\nimprisoned in my bottles together with a handful of wheat, barley, rice,\r\nor maize, the Bruchus invariably perished and left no offspring. The\r\nresult was the same with oleaginous seeds: such as castor-oil and\r\nsunflower. Nothing outside the bean family is of any use to the Bruchus.\r\nThus limited, its portion is none the less considerable, and it uses and\r\nabuses it with the utmost energy. The eggs are white, slender, and\r\ncylindrical. There is no method in their distribution, no choice in\r\ntheir deposition. The mother lays them singly or in little groups, on\r\nthe walls of the jar as well as on the haricots. In her negligence she\r\nwill even lay them on maize, coffee, castor-oil seeds, and other seeds,\r\non which the newly born grubs will promptly perish, not finding them to\r\ntheir taste. What place has maternal foresight here? Abandoned no matter\r\nwhere in the heap of seeds, the eggs are always in place, as it is left\r\nto the grub to search and to find the points of invasion.\r\n\r\nIn five days at most the egg is hatched. A little white creature with a\r\nred-brown head emerges. It is a mere speck of a creature, just visible\r\nto the naked eye. Its body is thickened forward, to give more strength\r\nto its implements--its mandibles--which have to perforate the hard\r\nsubstance of the dry bean, which is as tough as wood. The larvæ of the\r\nBuprestis and the Capricornis, which burrow in the trunks of trees, are\r\nsimilarly shaped. Directly it issues from the egg the wriggling creature\r\nmakes off at random with an activity we should hardly expect in one so\r\nyoung. It wanders hither and thither, eager to find food and shelter as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\nWithin twenty-four hours it has usually attained both. I see the tiny\r\ngrub perforate the horny skin that covers the cotyledons; I watch its\r\nefforts; I surprise it sunk half-way in the commencement of a burrow, at\r\nthe mouth of which is a white floury powder, the waste from the\r\nmandibles. It works its way inward and buries itself in the heart of the\r\nseed. It will emerge in the adult form in the course of about five\r\nweeks, so rapid is its evolution.\r\n\r\nThis hasty development allows of several generations in the year. I have\r\nrecorded four. On the other hand, one isolated couple has furnished me\r\nwith a family of eighty. Consider only the half of this\r\nnumber--supposing the sexes to be equal in number--and at the end of a\r\nyear the couples issued from this original pair would be represented by\r\nthe fortieth power of forty; in larvæ they would represent the frightful\r\ntotal of more than five millions. What a mountain of haricots would be\r\nravaged by such a legion!\r\n\r\nThe industry of the larvæ reminds us at every point what we have learned\r\nfrom the _Bruchus pisi_. Each grub excavates a lodging in the mass of\r\nthe bean, respecting the epidermis, and preparing a circular trap-door\r\nwhich the adult can easily open with a push at the moment of emergence.\r\nAt the termination of the larval phase the lodgements are betrayed on\r\nthe surface of the bean by so many shadowy circles. Finally the lid\r\nfalls, the insect leaves its cell, and the haricot remains pierced by as\r\nmany holes as it has nourished grubs.\r\n\r\nExtremely frugal, satisfied with a little farinaceous powder, the adults\r\nseem by no means anxious to abandon the native heap or bin so long as\r\nthere are beans untouched. They mate in the interstices of the heap;\r\nthe mothers sow their eggs at random; the young larvæ establish\r\nthemselves some in beans that are so far intact, some in beans which are\r\nperforated but not yet exhausted; and all through the summer the\r\noperations of breeding are repeated once in every five weeks. The last\r\ngeneration of the year--that of September or October--sleeps in its\r\ncells until the warm weather returns.\r\n\r\nIf the haricot pest were ever to threaten us seriously it would not be\r\nvery difficult to wage a war of extermination against it. Its habits\r\nteach us what tactics we ought to follow. It exploits the dried and\r\ngathered crop in the granary or the storehouse. If it is difficult to\r\nattack it in the open it would also be useless. The greater part of its\r\naffairs are managed elsewhere, in our storehouses. The enemy establishes\r\nitself under our roof and is ready to our hand. By means of insecticides\r\ndefence should be relatively easy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE GREY LOCUST\r\n\r\n\r\nI have just witnessed a moving spectacle: the last moult of a locust;\r\nthe emergence of the adult from its larval envelope. It was magnificent.\r\nI am speaking of the Grey Locust, the colossus among our acridians,[10]\r\nwhich is often seen among the vines in September when the grapes are\r\ngathered. By its size--and it grows as long as a man's finger--it lends\r\nitself to observation better than any other of its tribe.\r\n\r\nThe larva, disgustingly fat, like a rude sketch of the perfect insect,\r\nis commonly of a tender green; but it is sometimes of a bluish green, a\r\ndirty yellow, or a ruddy brown, or even an ashen grey, like the grey of\r\nthe adult cricket. The corselet is strongly keeled and indented, and is\r\nsprinkled with fine white spots. As powerful as in the adult insect, the\r\nhind-leg has a corpulent haunch, streaked with red, and a long shin like\r\na two-edged saw.\r\n\r\nThe elytra, which in a few days will extend far beyond the tip of the\r\nabdomen, are at present too small triangular wing-like appendages,\r\ntouching along their upper edges, and continuing and emphasising the\r\nkeel or ridge of the corselet. Their free ends stick up like the gable\r\nof a house. They remind one of the skirts of a coat, the maker of which\r\nhas been ludicrously stingy with the cloth, as they merely cover the\r\ncreature's nakedness at the small of the back. Underneath there are two\r\nnarrow appendages, the germs of the wings, which are even smaller than\r\nthe elytra. The sumptuous, elegant sails of to-morrow are now mere rags,\r\nso miserly in their dimensions as to be absolutely grotesque. What will\r\nemerge from these miserable coverings? A miracle of grace and amplitude.\r\n\r\nLet us observe the whole process in detail. Feeling itself ripe for\r\ntransformation, the insect climbs up the wire-gauze cover by means of\r\nits hinder and intermediate limbs. The fore-limbs are folded and crossed\r\non the breast, and are not employed in supporting the insect, which\r\nhangs in a reversed position, the back downwards. The triangular\r\nwinglets, the sheaths of the elytra, open along their line of juncture\r\nand separate laterally; the two narrow blades, which contain the wings,\r\nrise in the centre of the interval and slightly diverge. The proper\r\nposition for the process of moulting has now been assumed and the proper\r\nstability assured.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do is to burst the old skin. Behind the corselet,\r\nunder the pointed roof of the prothorax, a series of pulsations is\r\nproduced by alternate inflation and deflation. A similar state of\r\naffairs is visible in front of the neck, and probably under the entire\r\nsurface of the yielding carapace. The fineness of the membrane at the\r\narticulations enables us to perceive it at these unarmoured points, but\r\nthe cuirass of the corselet conceals it in the central portion.\r\n\r\nAt these points the circulatory reserves of the insect are pulsing in\r\ntidal onsets. Their gradual increase is betrayed by pulsations like\r\nthose of a hydraulic ram. Distended by this rush of humours, by this\r\ninjection in which the organism concentrates all its forces, the outer\r\nskin finally splits along the line of least resistance which the subtle\r\nprevisions of life have prepared. The fissure extends the whole length\r\nof the corselet, opening precisely along the ridge of the keel, as\r\nthough the two symmetrical halves had been soldered together.\r\nUnbreakable elsewhere, the envelope has yielded at this median point,\r\nwhich had remained weaker than the rest of the sheath. The fissure runs\r\nback a little way until it reaches a point between the attachments of\r\nthe wings; on the head it runs forward as far as the base of the\r\nantennæ, when it sends a short ramification right and left.\r\n\r\nThrough this breach the back is seen; quite soft, and very pale, with\r\nscarcely a tinge of grey. Slowly it curves upwards and becomes more and\r\nmore strongly hunched; at last it is free.\r\n\r\nThe head follows, withdrawing itself from its mask, which remains in\r\nplace, intact in the smallest detail, but looking very strange with its\r\ngreat unseeing glassy eyes. The sheaths of the antennæ, without a\r\nwrinkle, without the least derangement, and in their natural place, hang\r\nover this dead, translucid face.\r\n\r\nIn emerging from their narrow sheaths, which clasped them so tightly and\r\nprecisely, the thread-like antennæ have evidently met with no\r\nresistance, or the sheaths would have been turned inside out, or\r\ncrumpled out of shape, or wrinkled at least. Without harming the jointed\r\nor knotted covers, the contents, of equal volume and equally knotty,\r\nhave slipped out as easily as though they were smooth, slippery objects\r\nsliding out of a loose sheath. The method of extraction is still more\r\nastonishing in the case of the hind-legs.\r\n\r\nIt is now, however, the turn of the front and intermediate pairs of\r\nlegs. They pull out of their gauntlets and leggings without the least\r\nhitch; nothing is torn, nothing buckled; the outer skin is not even\r\ncrumpled, and all the tissues remain in their natural position. The\r\ninsect is now hanging from the dome of the cover solely by the claws of\r\nthe long hind-legs. It hangs in an almost vertical position, the head\r\ndownwards, swinging like a pendulum if I touch the cover. Four tiny,\r\nsteely claws are its only support. If they gave or unclasped themselves\r\nthe insect would be lost, as it is as yet unable to unfurl its enormous\r\nwings; but even had the wings emerged they could not grip the air in\r\ntime to save the creature from the consequences of a fall. But the four\r\nclaws hold fast; life, before withdrawing from them, left them rigidly\r\ncontracted, so that they should support without yielding the struggles\r\nand withdrawals to follow.\r\n\r\nNow the wing-covers and wings emerge. These are four narrow strips,\r\nvaguely seamed and furrowed, like strings of rolled tissue-paper. They\r\nare barely a quarter of their final length.\r\n\r\nThey are so soft that they bend under their own weight, and hang down\r\nthe creature's sides in the reverse of their normal position. The free\r\nextremities, which normally point backwards, are now pointing towards\r\nthe cricket's head as it hangs reversed. The organs of future flight are\r\nlike four leaves of withered foliage shattered by a terrific rainstorm.\r\n\r\nA profound transformation is necessary to bring the wings to their final\r\nperfection. The inner changes are already at work; liquids are\r\nsolidifying; albuminous secretions are bringing order out of chaos; but\r\nso far no outward sign betrays what is happening in the mysterious\r\nlaboratory of the organism. All seems inert and lifeless.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the posterior limbs disengage themselves. The great\r\nhaunches become visible, streaked on the inner faces with a pale rose,\r\nwhich rapidly turns to a vivid crimson. Emergence is easy, the thick and\r\nmuscular upper portion of the haunch preparing the way for the narrower\r\npart of the limb.\r\n\r\nIt is otherwise with the shank. This, in the adult insect, is armed\r\nalong its whole length by a double series of stiff, steely spines.\r\nMoreover, the lower extremity is terminated by four strong spurs. The\r\nshank forms a veritable saw, but with two parallel sets of teeth; and it\r\nis so strongly made that it may well be compared, the question of size\r\napart, to the great saw of a quarry-man.\r\n\r\nThe shank of the larva has the same structure, so that the object to be\r\nextracted is enclosed in a scabbard as awkwardly shaped as itself. Each\r\nspur is enclosed in a similar spur; each tooth engages in the hollow of\r\na similar tooth, and the sheath is so closely moulded upon the shank\r\nthat a no more intimate contact could be obtained by replacing the\r\nenvelope by a layer of varnish applied with a brush.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the tibia, long and narrow as it is, issues from its sheath\r\nwithout catching or sticking anywhere. If I had not repeatedly seen the\r\noperation I could not believe it possible; for the discarded sheath is\r\nabsolutely intact from end to end. Neither the terminal spurs nor the\r\ndouble rows of spines do the slightest damage to the delicate mould. The\r\nlong-toothed saw leaves the delicate sheath unbroken, although a puff of\r\nthe breath is enough to tear it; the ferocious spurs slip out of it\r\nwithout leaving so much as a scratch.\r\n\r\nI was far from expecting such a result. Having the spiny weapons of the\r\nlegs in mind, I imagined that those limbs would moult in scales and\r\npatches, or that the sheathing would rub off like a dead scarf-skin. How\r\ncompletely the reality surpassed my anticipations!\r\n\r\nFrom the spurs and spines of the sheath, which is as thin as the finest\r\ngold-beaters' skin, the spurs and spines of the leg, which make it a\r\nmost formidable weapon, capable of cutting a piece of soft wood, emerge\r\nwithout the slightest display of violence, without a hitch of any kind;\r\nand the empty skin remains in place. Still clinging by its claws to the\r\ntop of the wire cover, it is untorn, unwrinkled, uncreased. Even the\r\nmagnifying-glass fails to show a trace of rough usage. Such as the skin\r\nwas before the cricket left it, so it is now. The legging of dead skin\r\nremains in its smallest details the exact replica of the living limb.\r\n\r\nIf any one asked you to extract a saw from a scabbard exactly moulded\r\nupon the steel, and to conduct the operation without the slightest\r\ndegree of tearing or scratching, you would laugh at the flagrant\r\nimpossibility of the task. But life makes light of such absurdities; it\r\nhas its methods of performing the impossible when such methods are\r\nrequired. The leg of the locust affords us such an instance.\r\n\r\nHard as it is when once free of its sheath, the serrated tibia would\r\nabsolutely refuse to leave the latter, so closely does it fit, unless it\r\nwere torn to pieces. Yet the difficulty must be evaded, for it is\r\nindispensable that the sheaths of the legs should remain intact, in\r\norder to afford a firm support until the insect is completely\r\nextricated.\r\n\r\nThe leg in process of liberation is not the leg with which the locust\r\nmakes its leaps; it has not as yet the rigidity which it will soon\r\nacquire. It is soft, and eminently flexible. In those portions which the\r\nprogress of the moult exposes to view I see the legs bend under the mere\r\nweight of the suspended insect when I tilt the supporting cover. They\r\nare as flexible as two strips of elastic indiarubber. Yet even now\r\nconsolidation is progressing, for in a few minutes the proper rigidity\r\nwill be acquired.\r\n\r\nFurther along the limbs, in the portions which the sheathing still\r\nconceals, the legs are certainly softer still, and in the state of\r\nexquisite plasticity--I had almost said fluidity--which allows them to\r\npass through narrow passages almost as a liquid flows.\r\n\r\nThe teeth of the saws are already there, but have nothing of their\r\nimminent rigidity. With the point of a pen-knife I can partially uncover\r\na leg and extract the spines from their serrated mould. They are germs\r\nof spines; flexible buds which bend under the slightest pressure and\r\nresume their position the moment the pressure is removed.\r\n\r\nThese needles point backwards as the leg is drawn out of the sheath; but\r\nthey re-erect themselves and solidify as they emerge. I am witnessing\r\nnot the mere removal of leggings from limbs already clad in finished\r\narmour, but a kind of creation which amazes one by its promptitude.\r\n\r\nVery much in the same way, but with far less delicate precision, the\r\nclaws of the crayfish, at the period of the moult, withdraw the soft\r\nflesh of their double fingers from their stony sheath.\r\n\r\nFinally the long stilt-like legs are free. They are folded gently\r\nagainst the furrowed thighs, thus to mature undisturbed. The abdomen\r\nbegins to emerge. Its fine tunic-like covering splits, and wrinkles, but\r\nstill encloses the extremity of the abdomen, which adheres to the\r\nmoulted skin for some little time longer. With the exception of this one\r\npoint the entire insect is now uncovered.\r\n\r\nIt hangs head downwards, like a pendulum, supported by the talons of the\r\nnow empty leg-cases. During the whole of the lengthy and meticulous\r\nprocess the four talons have never yielded. The whole operation has been\r\nconducted with the utmost delicacy and prudence.\r\n\r\nThe insect hangs motionless, held by the tip of the abdomen. The abdomen\r\nis disproportionately distended; swollen, apparently, by the reserve of\r\norganisable humours which the expansion of the wings and wing-covers\r\nwill presently employ. Meanwhile the creature rests and recovers from\r\nits exertions. Twenty minutes of waiting elapse.\r\n\r\nThen, exerting the muscles of the back, the suspended insect raises\r\nitself and fixes the talons of the anterior limbs in the empty skin\r\nabove it. Never did acrobat, hanging by the toes to the bar of a\r\ntrapeze, raise himself with so stupendous a display of strength in the\r\nloins. This gymnastic feat accomplished, the rest is easy.\r\n\r\nWith the purchase thus obtained the insect rises a little and reaches\r\nthe wire gauze, the equivalent of the twig which would be chosen for the\r\nsite of the transformation in the open fields. It holds to this with the\r\nfour anterior limbs. Then the tip of the abdomen is finally liberated,\r\nand suddenly, shaken by the final struggle, the empty skin falls to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThis fall is interesting, and reminds me of the persistence with which\r\nthe empty husk of the Cigale braves the winds of winter, without falling\r\nfrom its supporting twig. The transfiguration of the locust takes place\r\nvery much as does that of the Cigale. How is it then that the acridian\r\ntrusts to a hold so easily broken?\r\n\r\nThe talons of the skin hold firmly so long as the labour of escape\r\ncontinues, although one would expect it to shake the firmest grip; yet\r\nthey yield at the slightest shock when the labour is terminated. There\r\nis evidently a condition of highly unstable equilibrium; showing once\r\nmore with what delicate precision the insect escapes from its sheath.\r\n\r\nFor want of a better term I said \"escape.\" But the word is ill chosen;\r\nfor it implies a certain amount of violence, and no violence must be\r\nemployed, on account of the instability of equilibrium already\r\nmentioned. If the insect, shaken by a sudden effort, were to lose its\r\nhold, it would be all up with it. It would slowly shrivel on the spot;\r\nor at best its wings, unable to expand, would remain as miserable scraps\r\nof tissue. The locust does not tear itself away from its sheath; it\r\ndelicately insinuates itself out of it--I had almost said flows. It is\r\nas though it were expelled by a gentle pressure.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the wings and elytra, which have made no apparent\r\nprogress since their emergence from their sheaths. They are still mere\r\nstumps, with fine longitudinal seams; almost like little ropes'-ends.\r\nTheir expansion, which will occupy more than three hours, is reserved\r\nfor the end, when the insect is completely moulted and in its normal\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nWe have just seen the insect turn head uppermost. This reversal causes\r\nthe wings and elytra to fall into their natural position. Extremely\r\nflexible, and yielding to their own weight, they had previously drooped\r\nbackwards with their free extremities pointing towards the head of the\r\ninsect as it hung reversed.\r\n\r\nNow, still by reason of their own weight, their position is rectified\r\nand they point in the normal direction. They are no longer curved like\r\nthe petals of a flower; they no longer point the wrong way; but they\r\nretain the same miserable aspect.\r\n\r\nIn its perfect state the wing is like a fan. A radiating bundle of\r\nstrong nervures runs through it in the direction of its length and forms\r\nthe framework of the fan, which is readily furled and unfurled. The\r\nintervals are crossed by innumerable cross-nervures of slighter\r\nsubstance, which make of the whole a network of rectangular meshes. The\r\nelytrum, which is heavier and much less extensive, repeats this\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nAt present nothing of this mesh-work is visible. Nothing can be seen but\r\na few wrinkles, a few flexuous furrows, which announce that the stumps\r\nare bundles of tissue cunningly folded and reduced to the smallest\r\npossible volume.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of the wing begins near the shoulder. Where nothing\r\nprecise could be distinguished at the outset we soon perceive a\r\ndiaphanous surface subdivided into meshes of beautiful precision.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, with a deliberation that escapes the magnifier, this\r\narea increases its bounds, at the expense of the shapeless bundle at the\r\nend of the wing. In vain I let my eyes rest on the spot where the\r\nexpanding network meets the still shapeless bundle; I can distinguish\r\nnothing. But wait a little, and the fine-meshed tissues will appear with\r\nperfect distinctness.\r\n\r\nTo judge from this first examination, one would guess that an\r\norganisable fluid is rapidly congealing into a network of nervures; one\r\nseems to be watching a process of crystallisation comparable, in its\r\nrapidity, to that of a saturated saline solution as seen through a\r\nmicroscope. But no; this is not what is actually happening. Life does\r\nnot do its work so abruptly.\r\n\r\nI detach a half-developed wing and bring it under the powerful eye of\r\nthe microscope. This time I am satisfied. On the confines of the\r\ntransparent network, where an extension of that network seems to be\r\ngradually weaving itself out of nothing, I can see that the meshes are\r\nreally already in existence. I can plainly recognise the longitudinal\r\nnervures, which are already stiff; and I can also see--pale, and without\r\nrelief--the transverse nervures. I find them all in the terminal stump,\r\nand am able to spread out a few of its folds under the microscope.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the wing is not a tissue in the process of making,\r\nthrough which the procreative energy of the vital juices is shooting its\r\nshuttle; it is a tissue already complete. To be perfect it lacks only\r\nexpansion and rigidity, just as a piece of lace or linen needs only to\r\nbe ironed.\r\n\r\nIn three hours or more the explanation is complete. The wings and elytra\r\nstand erect over the locust's back like an immense set of sails; at\r\nfirst colourless, then of a tender green, like the freshly expanded\r\nwings of the Cigale. I am amazed at their expanse when I think of the\r\nmiserable stumps from which they have expanded. How did so much material\r\ncontrive to occupy so little space?\r\n\r\nThere is a story of a grain of hemp-seed that contained all the\r\nbody-linen of a princess. Here we have something even more astonishing.\r\nThe hemp-seed of the story needed long years to germinate, to multiply,\r\nand at last to give the quantity of hemp required for the trousseau of a\r\nprincess; but the germ of the locust's wing has expanded to a\r\nmagnificent sail in a few short hours.\r\n\r\nSlowly the superb erection composed of the four flat fan-like pinions\r\nassumes rigidity and colour. By to-morrow the colour will have attained\r\nthe requisite shade. For the first time the wings close fan-wise and lie\r\ndown in their places; the elytra bend over at their outer edges, forming\r\na flange which lies snugly over the flanks. The transformation is\r\ncomplete. Now the great locust has only to harden its tissues a little\r\nlonger and to tan the grey of its costume in the ecstasy of the\r\nsunshine. Let us leave it to its happiness, and return to an earlier\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe four stumps which emerge from their coverings shortly after the\r\nrupture of the corselet along its median line contain, as we have seen,\r\nthe wings and elytra with their innumerable nervures. If not perfect,\r\nat least the general plan is complete, with all its innumerable details.\r\nTo expand these miserable bundles and convert them into an ample set of\r\nsails it is enough that the organism, acting like a force-pump, should\r\nforce into the channels already prepared a stream of humours kept in\r\nreserve for this moment and this purpose, the most laborious of the\r\nwhole process. As the capillary channels are prepared in advance a\r\nslight injection of fluid is sufficient to cause expansion.\r\n\r\nBut what were these four bundles of tissue while still enclosed in their\r\nsheaths? Are the wing-sheaths and the triangular winglets of the larva\r\nthe moulds whose folds, wrinkles, and sinuosities form their contents in\r\ntheir own image, and so weave the network of the future wings and\r\nwing-covers?\r\n\r\nWere they really moulds we might for a moment be satisfied. We might\r\ntell ourselves: It is quite a simple matter that the thing moulded\r\nshould conform to the cavity of the mould. But the simplicity is only\r\napparent, for the mould in its turn must somewhere derive the requisite\r\nand inextricable complexity. We need not go so far back; we should only\r\nbe in darkness. Let us keep to the observable facts.\r\n\r\nI examine with a magnifying-glass one of the triangular coat-tails of a\r\nlarva on the point of transformation. I see a bundle of moderately\r\nstrong nervures radiating fan-wise. I see other nervures in the\r\nintervals, pale and very fine. Finally, still more delicate, and running\r\ntransversely, a number of very short nervures complete the pattern.\r\n\r\nCertainly this resembles a rough sketch of the future wing-case; but\r\nhow different from the mature structure! The disposition of the\r\nradiating nervures, the skeleton of the structure, is not at all the\r\nsame; the network formed by the cross-nervures gives no idea whatever of\r\nthe complex final arrangement. The rudimentary is succeeded by the\r\ninfinitely complex; the clumsy by the infinitely perfect, and the same\r\nis true of the sheath of the wing and the final condition of its\r\ncontents, the perfect wing.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly evident, when we have the preparatory as well as the\r\nfinal condition of the wing before our eyes, that the wing-sheath of the\r\nlarva is not a simple mould which elaborates the tissue enclosed in its\r\nown image and fashions the wing after the complexities of its own\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\nThe future wing is not contained in the sheath as a bundle, which will\r\nastonish us, when expanded, by the extent and extreme complication of\r\nits surface. Or, to speak more exactly, it is there, but in a potential\r\nstate. Before becoming an actual thing it is a virtual thing which is\r\nnot yet, but is capable of becoming. It is there as the oak is inside\r\nthe acorn.\r\n\r\nA fine transparent cushion limits the free edge of the embryo wing and\r\nthe embryo wing-case. Under a powerful microscope we can perceive\r\ntherein a few doubtful lineaments of the future lace-work. This might\r\nwell be the factory in which life will shortly set its materials in\r\nmovement. Nothing more is visible; nothing that will make us foresee the\r\nprodigious network in which each mesh must have its form and place\r\npredetermined with geometrical exactitude.\r\n\r\nIn order that the organisable material can shape itself as a sheet of\r\ngauze and describe the inextricable labyrinth of the nervuration, there\r\nmust be something better and more wonderful than a mould. There is a\r\nprototypical plan, an ideal pattern, which imposes a precise position\r\nupon each atom of the tissue. Before the material commences to circulate\r\nthe configuration is already virtually traced, the courses of the\r\nplastic currents are already mapped out. The stones of our buildings\r\nco-ordinate according to the considered plan of the architect; they form\r\nan ideal assemblage before they exist as a concrete assemblage.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the wing of a cricket, that wonderful piece of lace-work\r\nemerging from a tiny sheath, speaks to us of another Architect, the\r\nauthor of the plans according to which life labours.\r\n\r\nThe genesis of living creatures offers to our contemplation an infinity\r\nof wonders far greater than this matter of a locust's wing; but in\r\ngeneral they pass unperceived, obscured as they are by the veil of time.\r\n\r\nTime, in the deliberation of mysteries, deprives us of the most\r\nastonishing of spectacles except our spirits be endowed with a tenacious\r\npatience. Here by exception the fact is accomplished with a swiftness\r\nthat forces the attention.\r\n\r\nWhosoever would gain, without wearisome delays, a glimpse of the\r\ninconceivable dexterity with which the forces of life can labour, has\r\nonly to consider the great locust of the vineyard. The insect will show\r\nhim that which is hidden from our curiosity by extreme deliberation in\r\nthe germinating seed, the opening leaf, and the budding flower. We\r\ncannot see the grass grow; but we can watch the growth of the locust's\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nAmazement seizes upon us before this sublime phantasmagoria of the grain\r\nof hemp which in a few hours has been transmuted into the finest cloth.\r\nWhat a mighty artist is Life, shooting her shuttle to weave the wings of\r\nthe locust--one of those insignificant insects of whom long ago Pliny\r\nsaid: _In his tam parcis, ferè nullis, quae vis, quae sapientia, quam\r\ninextricabilis perfectio!_\r\n\r\nHow truly was the old naturalist inspired! Let us repeat with him: \"What\r\npower, what wisdom, what inconceivable perfection in this least of\r\nsecrets that the vineyard locust has shown us!\"\r\n\r\nI have heard that a learned inquirer, for whom life is only a conflict\r\nof physical and chemical forces, does not despair of one day obtaining\r\nartificially organisable matter--_protoplasm_, as the official jargon\r\nhas it. If it were in my power I should hasten to satisfy this ambitious\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nBut so be it: you have really prepared protoplasm. By force of\r\nmeditation, profound study, minute care, impregnable patience, your\r\ndesire is realised: you have extracted from your apparatus an albuminous\r\nslime, easily corruptible and stinking like the devil at the end of a\r\nfew days: in short, a nastiness. What are you going to do with it?\r\n\r\nOrganise something? Will you give it the structure of a living edifice?\r\nWill you inject it with a hypodermic syringe between two impalpable\r\nplates to obtain were it only the wing of a fly?\r\n\r\nThat is very much what the locust does. It injects its protoplasm\r\nbetween the two surfaces of an embryo organ, and the material forms a\r\nwing-cover, because it finds as guide the ideal archetype of which I\r\nspoke but now. It is controlled in the labyrinth of its course by a\r\ndevice anterior to the injection: anterior to the material itself.\r\n\r\nThis archetype, the co-ordinator of forms; this primordial regulator;\r\nhave you got it on the end of your syringe? No! Then throw away your\r\nproduct. Life will never spring from that chemical filth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE PINE-CHAFER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe orthodox denomination of this insect is _Melolontha fullo_, Lin. It\r\ndoes not answer, I am very well aware, to be difficult in matters of\r\nnomenclature; make a noise of some sort, affix a Latin termination, and\r\nyou will have, as far as euphony goes, the equivalent of many of the\r\ntickets pasted in the entomologist's specimen boxes. The cacophony would\r\nbe excusable if the barbarous term signified nothing but the creature\r\nsignified; but as a rule this name possesses, hidden in its Greek or\r\nother roots, a certain meaning in which the novice hopes to find\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\nThe hope is a delusion. The learned term refers to subtleties difficult\r\nto comprehend, and of very indifferent importance. Too often it leads\r\nthe student astray, giving him glimpses that have nothing whatever in\r\ncommon with the truth as we know it from observation. Very often the\r\nerrors implied by such names are flagrant; sometimes the allusions are\r\nridiculous, grotesque, or merely imbecile. So long as they have a decent\r\nsound, how infinitely preferable are locutions in which etymology finds\r\nnothing to dissect! Of such would be the word _fullo_, were it not that\r\nit already has a meaning which immediately occurs to the mind. This\r\nLatin expression means a _fuller_; a person who kneads and presses cloth\r\nunder a stream of water, making it flexible and ridding it of the\r\nasperities of weaving. What connection has the subject of this chapter\r\nwith the fuller of cloth? I may puzzle my head in vain: no acceptable\r\nreply will occur to me.\r\n\r\nThe term _fullo_ as applied to an insect is found in Pliny. In one\r\nchapter the great naturalist treats of remedies against jaundice,\r\nfevers, and dropsy. A little of everything enters into this antique\r\npharmacy: the longest tooth of a black dog; the nose of a mouse wrapped\r\nin a pink cloth; the right eye of a green lizard torn from the living\r\nanimal and placed in a bag of kid-skin; the heart of a serpent, cut out\r\nwith the left hand; the four articulations of the tail of a scorpion,\r\nincluding the dart, wrapped tightly in a black cloth, so that for three\r\ndays the sick man can see neither the remedy nor him that applies it;\r\nand a number of other extravagances. We may well close the book, alarmed\r\nat the slough of the imbecility whence the art of healing has come down\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these imbecilities, the preludes of medicine, we find a\r\nmention of the \"fuller.\" _Tertium qui vocatur fullo, albis guttis,\r\ndissectum utrique lacerto adalligant_, says the text. To treat fevers\r\ndivide the fuller beetle in two parts and apply half under the right arm\r\nand half under the left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PINE-CHAFER.\r\n\r\n(_Melolontha fullo._)]\r\n\r\nNow what did the ancient naturalist mean by the term \"fuller beetle\"? We\r\ndo not precisely know. The qualification _albis guttis_, white spots,\r\nwould fit the Pine-chafer well enough, but it is not sufficient to\r\nmake us certain. Pliny himself does not seem to have been very certain\r\nof the identity of the remedy. In his time men's eyes had not yet\r\nlearned to see the insect world. Insects were too small; they were well\r\nenough for amusing children, who would tie them to the end of a long\r\nthread and make them walk in circles, but they were not worthy of\r\noccupying the attention of a self-respecting man.\r\n\r\nPliny apparently derived the word from the country-folk, always poor\r\nobservers and inclined to extravagant denominations. The scholar\r\naccepted the rural locution, the work perhaps of the imagination of\r\nchildhood, and applied it at hazard without informing himself more\r\nparticularly. The word came down to us embalmed with age; our modern\r\nnaturalists have accepted it, and thus one of our handsomest insects has\r\nbecome the \"fuller.\" The majesty of antiquity has consecrated the\r\nstrange appellation.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all my respect for the antique, I cannot myself accept the\r\nterm \"fuller,\" because under the circumstances it is absurd. Common\r\nsense should be considered before the aberrations of nomenclature. Why\r\nnot call our subject the Pine-chafer, in reference to the beloved tree,\r\nthe paradise of the insect during the two or three weeks of its aerial\r\nlife? Nothing could be simpler, or more appropriate, to give the better\r\nreason last.\r\n\r\nWe have to wander for ages in the night of absurdity before we reach the\r\nradiant light of the truth. All our sciences witness to this fact; even\r\nthe science of numbers. Try to add a column of Roman figures; you will\r\nabandon the task, stupefied by the confusion of symbols; and will\r\nrecognise what a revolution was made in arithmetic by the discovery of\r\nthe zero. Like the egg of Columbus, it was a very little thing, but it\r\nhad to be thought of.\r\n\r\nWhile hoping that the future will sink the unfortunate \"fuller\" in\r\noblivion, we will use the term \"pine chafer\" between ourselves. Under\r\nthat name no one can possibly mistake the insect in question, which\r\nfrequents the pine-tree only.\r\n\r\nIt has a handsome and dignified appearance, rivalling that of _Oryctes\r\nnasicornis_. Its costume, if it has not the metallic splendour dear to\r\nthe Scarabæi, the Buprestes and the rose-beetles, is at least unusually\r\nelegant. A black or chestnut background is thickly sown with\r\ncapriciously shaped spots of white velvet; a fashion both modest and\r\nhandsome.\r\n\r\nThe male bears at the end of his short antennæ a kind of plume\r\nconsisting of seven large superimposed plates or leaves, which, opening\r\nand closing like the sticks of a fan, betray the emotions that possess\r\nhim. At first sight it seems that this magnificent foliage must form a\r\nsense-organ of great perfection, capable of perceiving subtle odours, or\r\nalmost inaudible vibrations of the air, or other phenomena to which our\r\nsenses fail to respond; but the female warns us that we must not place\r\ntoo much reliance on such ideas; for although her maternal duties demand\r\na degree of impressionability at least as great as that of the male, yet\r\nthe plumes of her antennæ are extremely meagre, containing only six\r\nnarrow leaves.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the use of the enormous fan-like structure of the male\r\nantennæ? The seven-leaved apparatus is for the Pine-chafer what his long\r\nvibrating horns are to the Cerambyx and the panoply of the head to the\r\nOnthophagus and the forked antlers of the mandibles to the Stag-beetle.\r\nEach decks himself after his manner in these nuptial extravagances.\r\n\r\nThis handsome chafer appears towards the summer solstice, almost\r\nsimultaneously with the first Cigales. The punctuality of its appearance\r\ngives it a place in the entomological calendar, which is no less\r\npunctual than that of the seasons. When the longest days come, those\r\ndays which seem endless and gild the harvests, it never fails to hasten\r\nto its tree. The fires of St. John, reminiscences of the festivals of\r\nthe Sun, which the children light in the village streets, are not more\r\npunctual in their date.\r\n\r\nAt this season, in the hours of twilight, the Pine-chafer comes every\r\nevening if the weather is fine, to visit the pine-trees in the garden. I\r\nfollow its evolutions with my eyes. With a silent flight, not without\r\nspirit, the males especially wheel and wheel about, extending their\r\ngreat antennary plumes; they go to and fro, to and fro, a procession of\r\nflying shadows upon the pale blue of the sky in which the last light of\r\nday is dying. They settle, take flight again, and once more resume their\r\nbusy rounds. What are they doing up there during the fortnight of their\r\nfestival?\r\n\r\nThe answer is evident: they are courting their mates, and they continue\r\nto render their homage until the fall of night. In the morning both\r\nmales and females commonly occupy the lower branches. They lie there\r\nisolated, motionless, indifferent to passing events. They do not avoid\r\nthe hand about to seize them. Most of them are hanging by their hind\r\nlegs and nibbling the pine-needles; they seem to be gently drowsing with\r\nthe needles at their mouths. When twilight returns they resume their\r\nfrolics.\r\n\r\nTo watch these frolics in the tops of the trees is hardly possible; let\r\nus try to observe them in captivity. Four pairs are collected in the\r\nmorning and placed, with some twigs off the pine-tree, in a spacious;\r\ncage. The sight is hardly worth my attention; deprived of the\r\npossibility of flight, the insects cannot behave as in the open. At most\r\nI see a male from time to time approaching his beloved; he spreads out\r\nthe leaves of his antennæ, and agitates them so that they shiver\r\nslightly; he is perhaps informing himself if he is welcome. Thereupon he\r\nputs on his finest airs and exhibits his attainments. It is a useless\r\ndisplay; the female is motionless, as though insensible to these\r\ndemonstrations. Captivity has sorrows that are hard to overcome. This\r\nwas all that I was able to see. Mating, it appears, must take place\r\nduring the later hours of the night, so that I missed the propitious\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nOne detail in particular interested me. The Pine-chafer emits a musical\r\nnote. The female is as gifted as the male. Does the lover make use of\r\nhis faculty as a means of seduction and appeal? Does the female answer\r\nthe chirp of her _innamorata_ by a similar chirp? That this may be so\r\nunder normal conditions, amidst the foliage of the pines, is extremely\r\nprobable; but I can make no assertion, as I have never heard anything of\r\nthe kind either among the pines or in my laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe sound is produced by the extremity of the abdomen, which gently\r\nrises and falls, rubbing, as it does so, with its last few segments, the\r\nhinder edge of the wing-covers, which are held firm and motionless.\r\nThere is no special equipment on the rubbing surface nor on the surface\r\nrubbed. The magnifying-glass looks in vain for the fine striations\r\nusually found in the musical instruments of the insect world. All is\r\nsmooth on either hand. How then is the sound engendered?\r\n\r\nRub the end of the moistened finger on a strip of glass, or a\r\nwindow-pane, and you will obtain a very audible sound, somewhat\r\nanalogous to that emitted by the chafer. Better still, use a scrap of\r\nindiarubber to rub the glass with, and you will reproduce with some\r\nfidelity the sound in question. If the proper rhythm is observed the\r\nimitation is so successful that one might well be deceived by it.\r\n\r\nIn the musical apparatus of the Pine-chafer the pad of the finger-tip\r\nand the scrap of indiarubber are represented by the soft abdomen of the\r\ninsect, and the glass is represented by the blade of the wing-cover,\r\nwhich forms a thin, rigid plate, easily set in vibration. The\r\nsound-mechanism of the Pine-chafer is thus of the very simplest\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Acorn-Weevil, _see_ Elephant-Beetle\r\n\r\n  Ameles, _see_

not, it is certain\r\nthat one Cigale would be able to perceive another's cry. The vibrations\r\nof the male Cigale's cry would cause a resonance, a vibration, in the\r\nbody cavities of other male Cigales, and to a lesser extent in the\r\nsmaller cavities in the bodies of the females. Other sounds would cause\r\na slight shock, if loud enough, but not a perceptible vibration May not\r\nthis vibration--felt as in a cathedral we feel the vibrations of the\r\norgan-pipes in the bones of the chest and head or on the covers of the\r\nhymn-book in our hands--serve to keep the insects together, and enable\r\nthe females to keep within sight of the males? The sight of an insect is\r\nin one sense poor--it consists of a kind of mosaic picture, and for one\r\ninsect to distinguish another clearly the distance between them must not\r\nbe very great. Certain gregarious birds and fish whose colouring is\r\nprotective have a habit of showing their white bellies as they swerve on\r\nchanging their direction. These signals help to keep the flock together.\r\nThe white scut of the rabbit and of certain deer is a signal for other\r\ndeer or rabbits to follow a frightened flock. It is obviously to the\r\nadvantage of the Cigale to follow a gregarious habit, if only for\r\npurposes of propagation, for this would be facilitated by the sexes\r\nkeeping together, and, deaf or otherwise, the vibrations of its cry\r\nwould enable it to do so. It would be easy to show _a priori_ that the\r\nperception of such vibrations must cause the insect pleasure, as they\r\nstimulate a nervous structure attuned to the perception or capable of\r\nthe production of certain complex vibrations. The discord of the cry is\r\ncaused by the fact that it consists of a number of vibrations of\r\ndifferent pitch. Some would set the contents of the male resonating\r\ncavities in vibration; others would affect the less regular cavities in\r\nthe thorax of the female. We might compare the Cigale's cry to a\r\nsheep-bell. That it is felt and not heard explains its loudness and its\r\ngrating quality. A Cigale with the resonating cavities destroyed would\r\npossibly be lost. The experiment is worth trying.--[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It is not easy to understand why the Mantis should paralyse\r\nthe cricket with terror while the latter will immediately escape when\r\nthreatened by other enemies. As many species of Mantis exactly mimic\r\nsticks and leaves when motionless for purposes of defence, is it not\r\npossible that they mimic their surroundings for purposes of offence as\r\nwell? It is easy and natural to say that the Mantis presents a\r\nterrifying aspect. It does to us, by association; but how can we say\r\nthat it represents anything of the sort to the probably hypnotic or\r\nautomatic consciousness of the cricket? What does it really represent,\r\nas seen from below? A twig, terminating in a bud, with two branching\r\ntwigs growing from it, and a harmless nondescript fly or butterfly\r\nperched on the back of it. The combination of a familiar sight and a\r\nthreatening sound would very plausibly result in cautious immobility. As\r\nfor its instantaneous assumption of the pose, to move instantaneously is\r\nthe next best thing to not moving at all. It is less likely to startle\r\nthan a slow movement. Twigs which have been bent get suddenly released\r\nin the natural course of events; they do not move slowly. The\r\ninstantaneous appearance of a twig where no twig was before may possibly\r\ngive the victim pause; it may halt out of caution, not out of\r\nterror.--[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The word \"butterfly\" is here used, as is the French\r\n_papillon_, as a general term for all Lepidoptera; the insect in\r\nquestion is of course a moth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Now classified as _Lasiocampa quercus_.--[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Rabasso_ is the Provençal name for the truffle; hence a\r\ntruffle-hunter is known as a _rabassier_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Since these lines were written I have found it consuming\r\none of the true tuberaceæ, the _Tuber Requienii_, Tul., of the size of a\r\ncherry.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The difficulty in conceiving this theory lies in the fact\r\nthat the waves travel in straight lines. On the other hand, matter in a\r\nstate of degradation may expel particles highly energised and of\r\nenormous velocity. Most antennæ are covered with hairs of inconceivable\r\nfineness; others may contain cavities of almost infinite minuteness. Is\r\nit not thinkable that they are able to detect, in the gaseous\r\natmosphere, floating particles that are not gaseous? This would not\r\nprevent the specialisation of antennæ as mere feelers in some insects\r\nand crustaceans. The difficulty of such a supposition lies in the\r\nfact of discrimination; but if we did not possess a sense of taste or\r\nsmell discrimination would seem inconceivable in their case\r\nalso.--[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: This classification is now superseded; the Pea and Bean\r\nWeevils--_Bruchus pisi_ and _Bruchus lenti_--are classed as Bruchidæ, in\r\nthe series of Phytophaga. Most of the other weevils are classed as\r\nCurculionidæ, series Rhyncophora.--[TRANS.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The Christmas number (_Noël_) of the _Annales politiques\r\net littéraires: Les Enfants jugés par leurs pères_, 1901.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The American usage is to call acridians grasshoppers and\r\nLocustidæ locusts. The English usage is to call Locustidæ grasshoppers\r\nand acridians locusts. The Biblical locust is an acridian.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Demy 8vo, Cloth, 10/6 net\r\n\r\n  FABRE: POET OF SCIENCE\r\n\r\n  By G. V.
