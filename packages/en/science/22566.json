I know lots of other stories, and I hope to tell\r\nthem, some time or another; but just now my loving tyrants won't allow\r\nme. They cry: \"Oz--Oz! more about Oz, Mr. Baum!\" and what can I do but\r\nobey their commands?\r\n\r\nThis is Our Book--mine and the children's. For they have flooded me with\r\nthousands of suggestions in regard to it, and I have honestly tried to\r\nadopt as many of these suggestions as could be fitted into one story.\r\n\r\nAfter the wonderful success of \"Ozma of Oz\" it is evident that Dorothy\r\nhas become a firm fixture in these Oz stories. The little ones all love\r\nDorothy, and as one of my small friends aptly states: \"It isn't a real\r\nOz story without her.\" So here she is again, as sweet and gentle and\r\ninnocent as ever, I hope, and the heroine of another strange adventure.\r\n\r\nThere were many requests from my little correspondents for \"more about\r\nthe Wizard.\" It seems the jolly old fellow made hosts of friends in the\r\nfirst Oz book, in spite of the fact that he frankly acknowledged himself\r\n\"a humbug.\" The children had heard how he mounted into the sky in a\r\nballoon and they were all waiting for him to come down again. So what\r\ncould I do but tell \"what happened to the Wizard afterward\"? You will\r\nfind him in these pages, just the same humbug Wizard as before.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing the children demanded which I found it impossible to\r\ndo in this present book: they bade me introduce Toto, Dorothy's little\r\nblack dog, who has many friends among my readers. But you will see, when\r\nyou begin to read the story, that Toto was in Kansas while Dorothy was\r\nin California, and so she had to start on her adventure without him. In\r\nthis book Dorothy had to take her kitten with her instead of her dog;\r\nbut in the next Oz book, if I am permitted to write one, I intend to\r\ntell a good deal about Toto's further history.\r\n\r\nPrincess Ozma, whom I love as much as my readers do, is again introduced\r\nin this story, and so are several of our old friends of Oz. You will\r\nalso become acquainted with Jim the Cab-Horse, the Nine Tiny Piglets,\r\nand Eureka, the Kitten. I am sorry the kitten was not as well behaved as\r\nshe ought to have been; but perhaps she wasn't brought up properly.\r\nDorothy found her, you see, and who her parents were nobody knows.\r\n\r\nI believe, my dears, that I am the proudest story-teller that ever\r\nlived. Many a time tears of pride and joy have stood in my eyes while I\r\nread the tender, loving, appealing letters that come to me in almost\r\nevery mail from my little readers. To have pleased you, to have\r\ninterested you, to have won your friendship, and perhaps your love,\r\nthrough my stories, is to my mind as great an achievement as to become\r\nPresident of the United States. Indeed, I would much rather be your\r\nstory-teller, under these conditions, than to be the President. So you\r\nhave helped me to fulfill my life's ambition, and I am more grateful to\r\nyou, my dears, than I can express in words.\r\n\r\nI try to answer every letter of my young correspondents; yet sometimes\r\nthere are so many letters that a little time must pass before you get\r\nyour answer. But be patient, friends, for the answer will surely come,\r\nand by writing to me you more than repay me for the pleasant task of\r\npreparing these books. Besides, I am proud to acknowledge that the books\r\nare partly yours, for your suggestions often guide me in telling the\r\nstories, and I am sure they would not be half so good without your\r\nclever and thoughtful assistance.\r\n\r\n                                                     L.

It should have arrived at Hugson's\r\nsiding at midnight, but it was already five o'clock and the gray dawn\r\nwas breaking in the east when the little train slowly rumbled up to the\r\nopen shed that served for the station-house. As it came to a stop the\r\nconductor called out in a loud voice:\r\n\r\n\"Hugson's Siding!\"\r\n\r\nAt once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of the\r\ncar, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round bird-cage\r\ncovered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol was tucked\r\nunder her arm. The conductor helped her off the car and then the\r\nengineer started his train again, so that it puffed and groaned and\r\nmoved slowly away up the track. The reason he was so late was because\r\nall through the night there were times when the solid earth shook and\r\ntrembled under him, and the engineer was afraid that at any moment the\r\nrails might spread apart and an accident happen to his passengers. So he\r\nmoved the cars slowly and with caution.\r\n\r\nThe little girl stood still to watch until the train had disappeared\r\naround a curve; then she turned to see where she was.\r\n\r\nThe shed at Hugson's Siding was bare save for an old wooden bench, and\r\ndid not look very inviting. As she peered through the soft gray light\r\nnot a house of any sort was visible near the station, nor was any person\r\nin sight; but after a while the child discovered a horse and buggy\r\nstanding near a group of trees a short distance away. She walked toward\r\nit and found the horse tied to a tree and standing motionless, with its\r\nhead hanging down almost to the ground. It was a big horse, tall and\r\nbony, with long legs and large knees and feet. She could count his ribs\r\neasily where they showed through the skin of his body, and his head was\r\nlong and seemed altogether too big for him, as if it did not fit. His\r\ntail was short and scraggly, and his harness had been broken in many\r\nplaces and fastened together again with cords and bits of wire. The\r\nbuggy seemed almost new, for it had a shiny top and side curtains.\r\nGetting around in front, so that she could look inside, the girl saw a\r\nboy curled up on the seat, fast asleep.\r\n\r\nShe set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol. Presently\r\nhe woke up, rose to a sitting position and rubbed his eyes briskly.\r\n\r\n\"Hello!\" he said, seeing her, \"are you Dorothy Gale?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered, looking gravely at his tousled hair and blinking\r\ngray eyes. \"Have you come to take me to Hugson's Ranch?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he answered. \"Train in?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't be here if it wasn't,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank. Jumping out of\r\nthe buggy he put Dorothy's suit-case under the seat and her bird-cage on\r\nthe floor in front.\r\n\r\n\"Canary-birds?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; it's just Eureka, my kitten. I thought that was the best way to\r\ncarry her.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Eureka's a funny name for a cat,\" he remarked.\r\n\r\n\"I named my kitten that because I found it,\" she explained. \"Uncle Henry\r\nsays 'Eureka' means 'I have found it.'\"\r\n\r\n\"All right; hop in.\"\r\n\r\nShe climbed into the buggy and he followed her. Then the boy picked up\r\nthe reins, shook them, and said \"Gid-dap!\"\r\n\r\nThe horse did not stir. Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of his\r\ndrooping ears, but that was all.\r\n\r\n\"Gid-dap!\" called the boy, again.\r\n\r\nThe horse stood still.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Dorothy, \"if you untied him, he would go.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out.\r\n\r\n\"Guess I'm half asleep yet,\" he said, untying the horse. \"But Jim knows\r\nhis business all right--don't you, Jim?\" patting the long nose of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThen he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse at\r\nonce backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began to trot\r\ndown the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light.\r\n\r\n\"Thought that train would never come,\" observed the boy. \"I've waited at\r\nthat station for five hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had a lot of earthquakes,\" said Dorothy. \"Didn't you feel the ground\r\nshake?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but we're used to such things in California,\" he replied. \"They\r\ndon't scare us much.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOROTHY POKED THE BOY WITH HER PARASOL.]\r\n\r\n\"The conductor said it was the worst quake he ever knew.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he? Then it must have happened while I was asleep,\" he said,\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"How is Uncle Henry?\" she enquired, after a pause during which the horse\r\ncontinued to trot with long, regular strides.\r\n\r\n\"He's pretty well. He and Uncle Hugson have been having a fine visit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is Mr. Hugson your uncle?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Uncle Bill Hugson married your Uncle Henry's wife's sister; so we\r\nmust be second cousins,\" said the boy, in an amused tone. \"I work for\r\nUncle Bill on his ranch, and he pays me six dollars a month and my\r\nboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that a great deal?\" she asked, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's a great deal for Uncle Hugson, but not for me. I'm a splendid\r\nworker. I work as well as I sleep,\" he added, with a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"What is your name?\" asked Dorothy, thinking she liked the boy's manner\r\nand the cheery tone of his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Not a very pretty one,\" he answered, as if a little ashamed. \"My whole\r\nname is Zebediah; but folks just call me 'Zeb.' You've been to\r\nAustralia, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; with Uncle Henry,\" she answered. \"We got to San Francisco a week\r\nago, and Uncle Henry went right on to Hugson's Ranch for a visit while I\r\nstayed a few days in the city with some friends we had met.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long will you be with us?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Only a day. Tomorrow Uncle Henry and I must start back for Kansas.\r\nWe've been away for a long time, you know, and so we're anxious to get\r\nhome again.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy flicked the big, boney horse with his whip and looked\r\nthoughtful. Then he started to say something to his little companion,\r\nbut before he could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously from side\r\nto side and the earth seemed to rise up before them. Next minute there\r\nwas a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side Dorothy saw the ground\r\nopen in a wide crack and then come together again.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness!\" she cried, grasping the iron rail of the seat. \"What was\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was an awful big quake,\" replied Zeb, with a white face. \"It\r\nalmost got us that time, Dorothy.\"\r\n\r\nThe horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock. Zeb shook the\r\nreins and urged him to go, but Jim was stubborn. Then the boy cracked\r\nhis whip and touched the animal's flanks with it, and after a low moan\r\nof protest Jim stepped slowly along the road.\r\n\r\nNeither the boy nor the girl spoke again for some minutes. There was a\r\nbreath of danger in the very air, and every few moments the earth would\r\nshake violently. Jim's ears were standing erect upon his head and every\r\nmuscle of his big body was tense as he trotted toward home. He was not\r\ngoing very fast, but on his flanks specks of foam began to appear and at\r\ntimes he would tremble like a leaf.\r\n\r\nThe sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer sobbing sounds as\r\nit swept over the valley.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a rending, tearing sound, and the earth split into\r\nanother great crack just beneath the spot where the horse was standing.\r\nWith a wild neigh of terror the animal fell bodily into the pit, drawing\r\nthe buggy and its occupants after him.\r\n\r\nDorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy did the same. The\r\nsudden rush into space confused them so that they could not think.\r\n\r\nBlackness engulfed them on every side, and in breathless silence they\r\nwaited for the fall to end and crush them against jagged rocks or for\r\nthe earth to close in on them again and bury them forever in its\r\ndreadful depths.\r\n\r\nThe horrible sensation of falling, the darkness and the terrifying\r\nnoises, proved more than Dorothy could endure and for a few moments the\r\nlittle girl lost consciousness. Zeb, being a boy, did not faint, but he\r\nwas badly frightened, and clung to the buggy seat with a tight grip,\r\nexpecting every moment would be his last.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2.\r\n\r\nTHE GLASS CITY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothy recovered her senses they were still falling, but not so\r\nfast. The top of the buggy caught the air like a parachute or an\r\numbrella filled with wind, and held them back so that they floated\r\ndownward with a gentle motion that was not so very disagreeable to bear.\r\nThe worst thing was their terror of reaching the bottom of this great\r\ncrack in the earth, and the natural fear that sudden death was about to\r\novertake them at any moment. Crash after crash echoed far above their\r\nheads, as the earth came together where it had split, and stones and\r\nchunks of clay rattled around them on every side. These they could not\r\nsee, but they could feel them pelting the buggy top, and Jim screamed\r\nalmost like a human being when a stone overtook him and struck his\r\nboney body. They did not really hurt the poor horse, because everything\r\nwas falling together; only the stones and rubbish fell faster than the\r\nhorse and buggy, which were held back by the pressure of the air, so\r\nthat the terrified animal was actually more frightened than he was\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\nHow long this state of things continued Dorothy could not even guess,\r\nshe was so greatly bewildered. But bye and bye, as she stared ahead into\r\nthe black chasm with a beating heart, she began to dimly see the form of\r\nthe horse Jim--his head up in the air, his ears erect and his long legs\r\nsprawling in every direction as he tumbled through space. Also, turning\r\nher head, she found that she could see the boy beside her, who had until\r\nnow remained as still and silent as she herself.\r\n\r\nDorothy sighed and commenced to breathe easier. She began to realize\r\nthat death was not in store for her, after all, but that she had merely\r\nstarted upon another adventure, which promised to be just as queer and\r\nunusual as were those she had before encountered.\r\n\r\nWith this thought in mind the girl took heart and leaned her head over\r\nthe side of the buggy to see where the strange light was coming from.\r\nFar below her she found six great glowing balls suspended in the air.\r\nThe central and largest one was white, and reminded her of the sun.\r\nAround it were arranged, like the five points of a star, the other five\r\nbrilliant balls; one being rose colored, one violet, one yellow, one\r\nblue and one orange. This splendid group of colored suns sent rays\r\ndarting in every direction, and as the horse and buggy--with Dorothy and\r\nZeb--sank steadily downward and came nearer to the lights, the rays\r\nbegan to take on all the delicate tintings of a rainbow, growing more\r\nand more distinct every moment until all the space was brilliantly\r\nilluminated.\r\n\r\nDorothy was too dazed to say much, but she watched one of Jim's big ears\r\nturn to violet and the other to rose, and wondered that his tail should\r\nbe yellow and his body striped with blue and orange like the stripes of\r\na zebra. Then she looked at Zeb, whose face was blue and whose hair was\r\npink, and gave a little laugh that sounded a bit nervous.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it funny?\" she said.\r\n\r\nThe boy was startled and his eyes were big. Dorothy had a green streak\r\nthrough the center of her face where the blue and yellow lights came\r\ntogether, and her appearance seemed to add to his fright.\r\n\r\n\"I--I don't s-s-see any-thing funny--'bout it!\" he stammered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORSE, BUGGY AND ALL FELL SLOWLY.]\r\n\r\nJust then the buggy tipped slowly over upon its side, the body of the\r\nhorse tipping also. But they continued to fall, all together, and the\r\nboy and girl had no difficulty in remaining upon the seat, just as they\r\nwere before. Then they turned bottom side up, and continued to roll\r\nslowly over until they were right side up again. During this time Jim\r\nstruggled frantically, all his legs kicking the air; but on finding\r\nhimself in his former position the horse said, in a relieved tone of\r\nvoice:\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's better!\"\r\n\r\nDorothy and Zeb looked at one another in wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Can your horse talk?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Never knew him to, before,\" replied the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Those were the first words I ever said,\" called out the horse, who had\r\noverheard them, \"and I can't explain why I happened to speak then. This\r\nis a nice scrape you've got me into, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"As for that, we are in the same scrape ourselves,\" answered Dorothy,\r\ncheerfully. \"But never mind; something will happen pretty soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" growled the horse; \"and then we shall be sorry it\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\nZeb gave a shiver. All this was so terrible and unreal that he could not\r\nunderstand it at all, and so had good reason to be afraid.\r\n\r\nSwiftly they drew near to the flaming colored suns, and passed close\r\nbeside them. The light was then so bright that it dazzled their eyes,\r\nand they covered their faces with their hands to escape being blinded.\r\nThere was no heat in the colored suns, however, and after they had\r\npassed below them the top of the buggy shut out many of the piercing\r\nrays so that the boy and girl could open their eyes again.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to come to the bottom some time,\" remarked Zeb, with a deep\r\nsigh. \"We can't keep falling forever, you know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" said Dorothy. \"We are somewhere in the middle of the\r\nearth, and the chances are we'll reach the other side of it before long.\r\nBut it's a big hollow, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Awful big!\" answered the boy.\r\n\r\n\"We're coming to something now,\" announced the horse.\r\n\r\nAt this they both put their heads over the side of the buggy and looked\r\ndown. Yes; there was land below them; and not so very far away, either.\r\nBut they were floating very, very slowly--so slowly that it could no\r\nlonger be called a fall--and the children had ample time to take heart\r\nand look about them.\r\n\r\nThey saw a landscape with mountains and plains, lakes and rivers, very\r\nlike those upon the earth's surface; but all the scene was splendidly\r\ncolored by the variegated lights from the six suns. Here and there were\r\ngroups of houses that seemed made of clear glass, because they sparkled\r\nso brightly.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure we are in no danger,\" said Dorothy, in a sober voice. \"We are\r\nfalling so slowly that we can't be dashed to pieces when we land, and\r\nthis country that we are coming to seems quite pretty.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll never get home again, though!\" declared Zeb, with a groan.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm not so sure of that,\" replied the girl. \"But don't let us worry\r\nover such things, Zeb; we can't help ourselves just now, you know, and\r\nI've always been told it's foolish to borrow trouble.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy became silent, having no reply to so sensible a speech, and soon\r\nboth were fully occupied in staring at the strange scenes spread out\r\nbelow them. They seemed to be falling right into the middle of a big\r\ncity which had many tall buildings with glass domes and sharp-pointed\r\nspires. These spires were like great spear-points, and if they tumbled\r\nupon one of them they were likely to suffer serious injury.\r\n\r\nJim the horse had seen these spires, also, and his ears stood straight\r\nup with fear, while Dorothy and Zeb held their breaths in suspense. But\r\nno; they floated gently down upon a broad, flat roof, and came to a stop\r\nat last.\r\n\r\nWhen Jim felt something firm under his feet the poor beast's legs\r\ntrembled so much that he could hardly stand; but Zeb at once leaped out\r\nof the buggy to the roof, and he was so awkward and hasty that he kicked\r\nover Dorothy's birdcage, which rolled out upon the roof so that the\r\nbottom came off. At once a pink kitten crept out of the upset cage, sat\r\ndown upon the glass roof, and yawned and blinked its round eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Dorothy. \"There's Eureka.\"\r\n\r\n\"First time I ever saw a pink cat,\" said Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"Eureka isn't pink; she's white. It's this queer light that gives her\r\nthat color.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where's my milk?\" asked the kitten, looking up into Dorothy's face.\r\n\"I'm 'most starved to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Eureka! Can you talk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Talk! Am I talking? Good gracious, I believe I am. Isn't it funny?\"\r\nasked the kitten.\r\n\r\n\"It's all wrong,\" said Zeb, gravely. \"Animals ought not to talk. But\r\neven old Jim has been saying things since we had our accident.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't see that it's wrong,\" remarked Jim, in his gruff tones. \"At\r\nleast, it isn't as wrong as some other things. What's going to become of\r\nus now?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" answered the boy, looking around him curiously.\r\n\r\nThe houses of the city were all made of glass, so clear and transparent\r\nthat one could look through the walls as easily as though a window.\r\nDorothy saw, underneath the roof on which she stood, several rooms used\r\nfor rest chambers, and even thought she could make out a number of queer\r\nforms huddled into the corners of these rooms.\r\n\r\nThe roof beside them had a great hole smashed through it, and pieces of\r\nglass were lying scattered in every direction. A near by steeple had\r\nbeen broken off short and the fragments lay heaped beside it. Other\r\nbuildings were cracked in places or had corners chipped off from them;\r\nbut they must have been very beautiful before these accidents had\r\nhappened to mar their perfection. The rainbow tints from the colored\r\nsuns fell upon the glass city softly and gave to the buildings many\r\ndelicate, shifting hues which were very pretty to see.\r\n\r\nBut not a sound had broken the stillness since the strangers had\r\narrived, except that of their own voices. They began to wonder if there\r\nwere no people to inhabit this magnificent city of the inner world.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a man appeared through a hole in the roof next to the one they\r\nwere on and stepped into plain view. He was not a very large man, but\r\nwas well formed and had a beautiful face--calm and serene as the face of\r\na fine portrait. His clothing fitted his form snugly and was gorgeously\r\ncolored in brilliant shades of green, which varied as the sunbeams\r\ntouched them but was not wholly influenced by the solar rays.\r\n\r\nThe man had taken a step or two across the glass roof before he noticed\r\nthe presence of the strangers; but then he stopped abruptly. There was\r\nno expression of either fear or surprise upon his tranquil face, yet he\r\nmust have been both astonished and afraid; for after his eyes had rested\r\nupon the ungainly form of the horse for a moment he walked rapidly to\r\nthe furthest edge of the roof, his head turned back over his shoulder to\r\ngaze at the strange animal.\r\n\r\n\"Look out!\" cried Dorothy, who noticed that the beautiful man did not\r\nlook where he was going; \"be careful, or you'll fall off!\"\r\n\r\nBut he paid no attention to her warning. He reached the edge of the tall\r\nroof, stepped one foot out into the air, and walked into space as calmly\r\nas if he were on firm ground.\r\n\r\nThe girl, greatly astonished, ran to lean over the edge of the roof, and\r\nsaw the man walking rapidly through the air toward the ground. Soon he\r\nreached the street and disappeared through a glass doorway into one of\r\nthe glass buildings.\r\n\r\n\"How strange!\" she exclaimed, drawing a long breath.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but it's lots of fun, if it _is_ strange,\" remarked the small\r\nvoice of the kitten, and Dorothy turned to find her pet walking in the\r\nair a foot or so away from the edge of the roof.\r\n\r\n\"Come back, Eureka!\" she called, in distress, \"you'll certainly be\r\nkilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nine lives,\" said the kitten, purring softly as it walked around\r\nin a circle and then came back to the roof; \"but I can't lose even one\r\nof them by falling in this country, because I really couldn't manage to\r\nfall if I wanted to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does the air bear up your weight?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Of course; can't you see?\" and again the kitten wandered into the air\r\nand back to the edge of the roof.\r\n\r\n\"It's wonderful!\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we let Eureka go down to the street and get some one to help\r\nus,\" suggested Zeb, who had been even more amazed than Dorothy at these\r\nstrange happenings.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we can walk on the air ourselves,\" replied the girl.\r\n\r\nZeb drew back with a shiver.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't dare try,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"May be Jim will go,\" continued Dorothy, looking at the horse.\r\n\r\n\"And may be he won't!\" answered Jim. \"I've tumbled through the air long\r\nenough to make me contented on this roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we didn't tumble to the roof,\" said the girl; \"by the time we\r\nreached here we were floating very slowly, and I'm almost sure we could\r\nfloat down to the street without getting hurt. Eureka walks on the air\r\nall right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eureka weighs only about half a pound,\" replied the horse, in a\r\nscornful tone, \"while I weigh about half a ton.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't weigh as much as you ought to, Jim,\" remarked the girl,\r\nshaking her head as she looked at the animal. \"You're dreadfully\r\nskinny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well; I'm old,\" said the horse, hanging his head despondently, \"and\r\nI've had lots of trouble in my day, little one. For a good many years I\r\ndrew a public cab in Chicago, and that's enough to make anyone skinny.\"\r\n\r\n\"He eats enough to get fat, I'm sure,\" said the boy, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Do I? Can you remember any breakfast that I've had today?\" growled Jim,\r\nas if he resented Zeb's speech.\r\n\r\n\"None of us has had breakfast,\" said the boy; \"and in a time of danger\r\nlike this it's foolish to talk about eating.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is more dangerous than being without food,\" declared the horse,\r\nwith a sniff at the rebuke of his young master; \"and just at present no\r\none can tell whether there are any oats in this queer country or not. If\r\nthere are, they are liable to be glass oats!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"COME ON, JIM! IT'S ALL RIGHT.\"]\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"I can see plenty of nice gardens and\r\nfields down below us, at the edge of this city. But I wish we could find\r\na way to get to the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you walk down?\" asked Eureka. \"I'm as hungry as the horse is,\r\nand I want my milk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you try it, Zeb\" asked the girl, turning to her companion.\r\n\r\nZeb hesitated. He was still pale and frightened, for this dreadful\r\nadventure had upset him and made him nervous and worried. But he did not\r\nwish the little girl to think him a coward, so he advanced slowly to the\r\nedge of the roof.\r\n\r\nDorothy stretched out a hand to him and Zeb put one foot out and let it\r\nrest in the air a little over the edge of the roof. It seemed firm\r\nenough to walk upon, so he took courage and put out the other foot.\r\nDorothy kept hold of his hand and followed him, and soon they were both\r\nwalking through the air, with the kitten frisking beside them.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Jim!\" called the boy. \"It's all right.\"\r\n\r\nJim had crept to the edge of the roof to look over, and being a sensible\r\nhorse and quite experienced, he made up his mind that he could go where\r\nthe others did. So, with a snort and a neigh and a whisk of his short\r\ntail he trotted off the roof into the air and at once began floating\r\ndownward to the street. His great weight made him fall faster than the\r\nchildren walked, and he passed them on the way down; but when he came to\r\nthe glass pavement he alighted upon it so softly that he was not even\r\njarred.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" said Dorothy, drawing a long breath, \"What a strange\r\ncountry this is.\"\r\n\r\nPeople began to come out of the glass doors to look at the new arrivals,\r\nand pretty soon quite a crowd had assembled. There were men and women,\r\nbut no children at all, and the folks were all beautifully formed and\r\nattractively dressed and had wonderfully handsome faces. There was not\r\nan ugly person in all the throng, yet Dorothy was not especially pleased\r\nby the appearance of these people because their features had no more\r\nexpression than the faces of dolls. They did not smile nor did they\r\nfrown, or show either fear or surprise or curiosity or friendliness.\r\nThey simply stared at the strangers, paying most attention to Jim and\r\nEureka, for they had never before seen either a horse or a cat and the\r\nchildren bore an outward resemblance to themselves.\r\n\r\nPretty soon a man joined the group who wore a glistening star in the\r\ndark hair just over his forehead. He seemed to be a person of authority,\r\nfor the others pressed back to give him room. After turning his composed\r\neyes first upon the animals and then upon the children he said to Zeb,\r\nwho was a little taller than Dorothy:\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, intruder, was it you who caused the Rain of Stones?\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment the boy did not know what he meant by this question. Then,\r\nremembering the stones that had fallen with them and passed them long\r\nbefore they had reached this place, he answered:\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; we didn't cause anything. It was the earthquake.\"\r\n\r\nThe man with the star stood for a time quietly thinking over this\r\nspeech. Then he asked:\r\n\r\n\"What is an earthquake?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said Zeb, who was still confused. But Dorothy, seeing\r\nhis perplexity, answered:\r\n\r\n\"It's a shaking of the earth. In this quake a big crack opened and we\r\nfell through--horse and buggy, and all--and the stones got loose and\r\ncame down with us.\"\r\n\r\nThe man with the star regarded her with his calm, expressionless eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The Rain of Stones has done much damage to our city,\" he said; \"and we\r\nshall hold you responsible for it unless you can prove your innocence.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we do that?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"That I am not prepared to say. It is your affair, not mine. You must\r\ngo to the House of the Sorcerer, who will soon discover the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the House of the Sorcerer?\" the girl enquired.\r\n\r\n\"I will lead you to it. Come!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and walked down the street, and after a moment's hesitation\r\nDorothy caught Eureka in her arms and climbed into the buggy. The boy\r\ntook his seat beside her and said: \"Gid-dap, Jim.\"\r\n\r\nAs the horse ambled along, drawing the buggy, the people of the glass\r\ncity made way for them and formed a procession in their rear. Slowly\r\nthey moved down one street and up another, turning first this way and\r\nthen that, until they came to an open square in the center of which was\r\na big glass palace having a central dome and four tall spires on each\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3.\r\n\r\nTHE ARRIVAL OF THE WIZARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doorway of the glass palace was quite big enough for the horse and\r\nbuggy to enter, so Zeb drove straight through it and the children found\r\nthemselves in a lofty hall that was very beautiful. The people at once\r\nfollowed and formed a circle around the sides of the spacious room,\r\nleaving the horse and buggy and the man with the star to occupy the\r\ncenter of the hall.\r\n\r\n\"Come to us, oh, Gwig!\" called the man, in a loud voice.\r\n\r\nInstantly a cloud of smoke appeared and rolled over the floor; then it\r\nslowly spread and ascended into the dome, disclosing a strange personage\r\nseated upon a glass throne just before Jim's nose. He was formed just as\r\nwere the other inhabitants of this land and his clothing only differed\r\nfrom theirs in being bright yellow. But he had no hair at all, and all\r\nover his bald head and face and upon the backs of his hands grew sharp\r\nthorns like those found on the branches of rose-bushes. There was even a\r\nthorn upon the tip of his nose and he looked so funny that Dorothy\r\nlaughed when she saw him.\r\n\r\nThe Sorcerer, hearing the laugh, looked toward the little girl with\r\ncold, cruel eyes, and his glance made her grow sober in an instant.\r\n\r\n\"Why have you dared to intrude your unwelcome persons into the secluded\r\nLand of the Mangaboos?\" he asked, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"'Cause we couldn't help it,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you wickedly and viciously send the Rain of Stones to crack and\r\nbreak our houses?\" he continued.\r\n\r\n\"We didn't,\" declared the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Prove it!\" cried the Sorcerer.\r\n\r\n\"We don't have to prove it,\" answered Dorothy, indignantly. \"If you had\r\nany sense at all you'd known it was the earthquake.\"\r\n\r\n\"We only know that yesterday came a Rain of Stones upon us, which did\r\nmuch damage and injured some of our people. Today came another Rain of\r\nStones, and soon after it you appeared among us.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the way,\" said the man with the star, looking steadily at the\r\nSorcerer, \"you told us yesterday that there would not be a second Rain\r\nof Stones. Yet one has just occurred that was even worse than the first.\r\nWhat is your sorcery good for if it cannot tell us the truth?\"\r\n\r\n\"My sorcery does tell the truth!\" declared the thorn-covered man. \"I\r\nsaid there would be but one Rain of Stones. This second one was a Rain\r\nof People-and-Horse-and-Buggy. And some stones came with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will there be any more Rains?\" asked the man with the star.\r\n\r\n\"No, my Prince.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither stones nor people?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, my Prince.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite sure, my Prince. My sorcery tells me so.\"\r\n\r\nJust then a man came running into the hall and addressed the Prince\r\nafter making a low bow.\r\n\r\n\"More wonders in the air, my Lord,\" said he.\r\n\r\nImmediately the Prince and all of his people flocked out of the hall\r\ninto the street, that they might see what was about to happen. Dorothy\r\nand Zeb jumped out of the buggy and ran after them, but the Sorcerer\r\nremained calmly in his throne.\r\n\r\nFar up in the air was an object that looked like a balloon. It was not\r\nso high as the glowing star of the six colored suns, but was descending\r\nslowly through the air--so slowly that at first it scarcely seemed to\r\nmove.\r\n\r\nThe throng stood still and waited. It was all they could do, for to go\r\naway and leave that strange sight was impossible; nor could they hurry\r\nits fall in any way. The earth children were not noticed, being so near\r\nthe average size of the Mangaboos, and the horse had remained in the\r\nHouse of the Sorcerer, with Eureka curled up asleep on the seat of the\r\nbuggy.\r\n\r\nGradually the balloon grew bigger, which was proof that it was settling\r\ndown upon the Land of the Mangaboos. Dorothy was surprised to find how\r\npatient the people were, for her own little heart was beating rapidly\r\nwith excitement. A balloon meant to her some other arrival from the\r\nsurface of the earth, and she hoped it would be some one able to assist\r\nher and Zeb out of their difficulties.\r\n\r\nIn an hour the balloon had come near enough for her to see a basket\r\nsuspended below it; in two hours she could see a head looking over the\r\nside of the basket; in three hours the big balloon settled slowly into\r\nthe great square in which they stood and came to rest on the glass\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nThen a little man jumped out of the basket, took off his tall hat, and\r\nbowed very gracefully to the crowd of Mangaboos around him. He was quite\r\nan old little man, and his head was long and entirely bald.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" cried Dorothy, in amazement, \"it's Oz!\"\r\n\r\nThe little man looked toward her and seemed as much surprised as she\r\nwas. But he smiled and bowed as he answered:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear; I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Eh? And you are little\r\nDorothy, from Kansas. I remember you very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who did you say it was?\" whispered Zeb to the girl.\r\n\r\n\"It's the wonderful Wizard of Oz. Haven't you heard of him?\"\r\n\r\nJust then the man with the star came and stood before the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said he, \"why are you here, in the Land of the Mangaboos?\"\r\n\r\n\"Didn't know what land it was, my son,\" returned the other, with a\r\npleasant smile; \"and, to be honest, I didn't mean to visit you when I\r\nstarted out. I live on top of the earth, your honor, which is far better\r\nthan living inside it; but yesterday I went up in a balloon, and when I\r\ncame down I fell into a big crack in the earth, caused by an earthquake.\r\nI had let so much gas out of my balloon that I could not rise again,\r\nand in a few minutes the earth closed over my head. So I continued to\r\ndescend until I reached this place, and if you will show me a way to get\r\nout of it, I'll go with pleasure. Sorry to have troubled you; but it\r\ncouldn't be helped.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince had listened with attention. Said he:\r\n\r\n\"This child, who is from the crust of the earth, like yourself, called\r\nyou a Wizard. Is not a Wizard something like a Sorcerer?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's better,\" replied Oz, promptly. \"One Wizard is worth three\r\nSorcerers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you shall prove that,\" said the Prince. \"We Mangaboos have, at the\r\npresent time, one of the most wonderful Sorcerers that ever was picked\r\nfrom a bush; but he sometimes makes mistakes. Do you ever make\r\nmistakes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" declared the Wizard, boldly.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Oz!\" said Dorothy; \"you made a lot of mistakes when you were in the\r\nmarvelous Land of Oz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said the little man, turning red--although just then a ray\r\nof violet sunlight was on his round face.\r\n\r\n\"Come with me,\" said the Prince to him. \"I wish you to meet our\r\nSorcerer.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wizard did not like this invitation, but he could not refuse to\r\naccept it. So he followed the Prince into the great domed hall, and\r\nDorothy and Zeb came after them, while the throng of people trooped in\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThere sat the thorny Sorcerer in his chair of state, and when the Wizard\r\nsaw him he began to laugh, uttering comical little chuckles.\r\n\r\n\"What an absurd creature!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"He may look absurd,\" said the Prince, in his quiet voice; \"but he is an\r\nexcellent Sorcerer. The only fault I find with him is that he is so\r\noften wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am never wrong,\" answered the Sorcerer.\r\n\r\n\"Only a short time ago you told me there would be no more Rain of Stones\r\nor of People,\" said the Prince.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is another person descended from the air to prove you were wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"One person cannot be called 'people,'\" said the Sorcerer. \"If two\r\nshould come out of the sky you might with justice say I was wrong; but\r\nunless more than this one appears I will hold that I was right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very clever,\" said the Wizard, nodding his head as if pleased. \"I am\r\ndelighted to find humbugs inside the earth, just the same as on top of\r\nit. Were you ever with a circus, brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said the Sorcerer.\r\n\r\n\"You ought to join one,\" declared the little man seriously. \"I belong to\r\nBailum & Barney's Great Consolidated Shows--three rings in one tent and\r\na menagerie on the side. It's a fine aggregation, I assure you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you do?\" asked the Sorcerer.\r\n\r\n\"I go up in a balloon, usually, to draw the crowds to the circus. But\r\nI've just had the bad luck to come out of the sky, skip the solid earth,\r\nand land lower down than I intended. But never mind. It isn't everybody\r\nwho gets a chance to see your Land of the Gabazoos.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mangaboos,\" said the Sorcerer, correcting him. \"If you are a Wizard you\r\nought to be able to call people by their right names.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I'm a Wizard; you may be sure of that. Just as good a Wizard as you\r\nare a Sorcerer.\"\r\n\r\n\"That remains to be seen,\" said the other.\r\n\r\n\"If you are able to prove that you are better,\" said the Prince to the\r\nlittle man, \"I will make you the Chief Wizard of this domain.\r\nOtherwise--\"\r\n\r\n\"What will happen otherwise?\" asked the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"I will stop you from living, and forbid you to be planted,\" returned\r\nthe Prince.\r\n\r\n\"That does not sound especially pleasant,\" said the little man, looking\r\nat the one with the star uneasily. \"But never mind. I'll beat Old\r\nPrickly, all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name is Gwig,\" said the Sorcerer, turning his heartless, cruel eyes\r\nupon his rival. \"Let me see you equal the sorcery I am about to\r\nperform.\"\r\n\r\nHe waved a thorny hand and at once the tinkling of bells was heard,\r\nplaying sweet music. Yet, look where she would, Dorothy could discover\r\nno bells at all in the great glass hall.\r\n\r\nThe Mangaboo people listened, but showed no great interest. It was one\r\nof the things Gwig usually did to prove he was a sorcerer.\r\n\r\nNow was the Wizard's turn, so he smiled upon the assemblage and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Will somebody kindly loan me a hat?\"\r\n\r\nNo one did, because the Mangaboos did not wear hats, and Zeb had lost\r\nhis, somehow, in his flight through the air.\r\n\r\n\"Ahem!\" said the Wizard, \"will somebody please loan me a handkerchief?\"\r\n\r\nBut they had no handkerchiefs, either.\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" remarked the Wizard. \"I'll use my own hat, if you please.\r\nNow, good people, observe me carefully. You see, there is nothing up my\r\nsleeve and nothing concealed about my person. Also, my hat is quite\r\nempty.\" He took off his hat and held it upside down, shaking it\r\nbriskly.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see it,\" said the Sorcerer.\r\n\r\nHe took the hat and examined it carefully, returning it afterward to the\r\nWizard.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the little man, \"I will create something out of nothing.\"\r\n\r\nHe placed the hat upon the glass floor, made a pass with his hand, and\r\nthen removed the hat, displaying a little white piglet no bigger than a\r\nmouse, which began to run around here and there and to grunt and squeal\r\nin a tiny, shrill voice.\r\n\r\nThe people watched it intently, for they had never seen a pig before,\r\nbig or little. The Wizard reached out, caught the wee creature in his\r\nhand, and holding its head between one thumb and finger and its tail\r\nbetween the other thumb and finger he pulled it apart, each of the two\r\nparts becoming a whole and separate piglet in an instant.\r\n\r\nHe placed one upon the floor, so that it could run around, and pulled\r\napart the other, making three piglets in all; and then one of these was\r\npulled apart, making four piglets. The Wizard continued this surprising\r\nperformance until nine tiny piglets were running about at his feet, all\r\nsquealing and grunting in a very comical way.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the Wizard of Oz, \"having created something from nothing, I\r\nwill make something nothing again.\"\r\n\r\nWith this he caught up two of the piglets and pushed them together, so\r\nthat the two were one. Then he caught up another piglet and pushed it\r\ninto the first, where it disappeared. And so, one by one, the nine tiny\r\npiglets were pushed together until but a single one of the creatures\r\nremained. This the Wizard placed underneath his hat and made a mystic\r\nsign above it. When he removed his hat the last piglet had disappeared\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nThe little man gave a bow to the silent throng that had watched him, and\r\nthen the Prince said, in his cold, calm voice:\r\n\r\n\"You are indeed a wonderful Wizard, and your powers are greater than\r\nthose of my Sorcerer.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will not be a wonderful Wizard long,\" remarked Gwig.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" enquired the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"Because I am going to stop your breath,\" was the reply. \"I perceive\r\nthat you are curiously constructed, and that if you cannot breathe you\r\ncannot keep alive.\"\r\n\r\nThe little man looked troubled.\r\n\r\n\"How long will it take you to stop my breath?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"About five minutes. I'm going to begin now. Watch me carefully.\"\r\n\r\nHe began making queer signs and passes toward the Wizard; but the little\r\nman did not watch him long. Instead, he drew a leathern case from his\r\npocket and took from it several sharp knives, which he joined together,\r\none after another, until they made a long sword. By the time he had\r\nattached a handle to this sword he was having much trouble to breathe,\r\nas the charm of the Sorcerer was beginning to take effect.\r\n\r\nSo the Wizard lost no more time, but leaping forward he raised the sharp\r\nsword, whirled it once or twice around his head, and then gave a mighty\r\nstroke that cut the body of the Sorcerer exactly in two.\r\n\r\nDorothy screamed and expected to see a terrible sight; but as the two\r\nhalves of the Sorcerer fell apart on the floor she saw that he had no\r\nbones or blood inside of him at all, and that the place where he was cut\r\nlooked much like a sliced turnip or potato.\r\n\r\n\"Why, he's vegetable!\" cried the Wizard, astonished.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" said the Prince. \"We are all vegetable, in this country.\r\nAre you not vegetable, also?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the Wizard. \"People on top of the earth are all meat.\r\nWill your Sorcerer die?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, sir. He is really dead now, and will wither very quickly. So\r\nwe must plant him at once, that other Sorcerers may grow upon his bush,\"\r\ncontinued the Prince.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" asked the little Wizard, greatly puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"If you will accompany me to our public gardens,\" replied the Prince, \"I\r\nwill explain to you much better than I can here the mysteries of our\r\nVegetable Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WIZARD CUT THE SORCERER EXACTLY IN TWO.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4.\r\n\r\nTHE VEGETABLE KINGDOM\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the Wizard had wiped the dampness from his sword and taken it\r\napart and put the pieces into their leathern case again, the man with\r\nthe star ordered some of his people to carry the two halves of the\r\nSorcerer to the public gardens.\r\n\r\nJim pricked up his ears when he heard they were going to the gardens,\r\nand wanted to join the party, thinking he might find something proper to\r\neat; so Zeb put down the top of the buggy and invited the Wizard to ride\r\nwith them. The seat was amply wide enough for the little man and the two\r\nchildren, and when Jim started to leave the hall the kitten jumped upon\r\nhis back and sat there quite contentedly.\r\n\r\nSo the procession moved through the streets, the bearers of the Sorcerer\r\nfirst, the Prince next, then Jim drawing the buggy with the strangers\r\ninside of it, and last the crowd of vegetable people who had no hearts\r\nand could neither smile nor frown.\r\n\r\nThe glass city had several fine streets, for a good many people lived\r\nthere; but when the procession had passed through these it came upon a\r\nbroad plain covered with gardens and watered by many pretty brooks that\r\nflowed through it. There were paths through these gardens, and over some\r\nof the brooks were ornamental glass bridges.\r\n\r\nDorothy and Zeb now got out of the buggy and walked beside the Prince,\r\nso that they might see and examine the flowers and plants better.\r\n\r\n\"Who built these lovely bridges?\" asked the little girl.\r\n\r\n\"No one built them,\" answered the man with the star. \"They grow.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's queer,\" said she. \"Did the glass houses in your city grow, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he replied. \"But it took a good many years for them to grow\r\nas large and fine as they are now. That is why we are so angry when a\r\nRain of Stones comes to break our towers and crack our roofs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't you mend them?\" she enquired.\r\n\r\n\"No; but they will grow together again, in time, and we must wait until\r\nthey do.\"\r\n\r\nThey first passed through many beautiful gardens of flowers, which grew\r\nnearest the city; but Dorothy could hardly tell what kind of flowers\r\nthey were, because the colors were constantly changing under the\r\nshifting lights of the six suns. A flower would be pink one second,\r\nwhite the next, then blue or yellow; and it was the same way when they\r\ncame to the plants, which had broad leaves and grew close to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhen they passed over a field of grass Jim immediately stretched down\r\nhis head and began to nibble.\r\n\r\n\"A nice country this is,\" he grumbled, \"where a respectable horse has to\r\neat pink grass!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's violet,\" said the Wizard, who was in the buggy.\r\n\r\n\"Now it's blue,\" complained the horse. \"As a matter of fact, I'm eating\r\nrainbow grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does it taste?\" asked the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"Not bad at all,\" said Jim. \"If they give me plenty of it I'll not\r\ncomplain about its color.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the party had reached a freshly plowed field, and the\r\nPrince said to Dorothy:\r\n\r\n\"This is our planting-ground.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral Mangaboos came forward with glass spades and dug a hole in the\r\nground. Then they put the two halves of the Sorcerer into it and covered\r\nhim up. After that other people brought water from a brook and sprinkled\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n\"He will sprout very soon,\" said the Prince, \"and grow into a large\r\nbush, from which we shall in time be able to pick several very good\r\nsorcerers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do all your people grow on bushes?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" was the reply. \"Do not all people grow upon bushes where\r\nyou came from, on the outside of the earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that I ever heard of.\"\r\n\r\n\"How strange! But if you will come with me to one of our folk gardens I\r\nwill show you the way we grow in the Land of the Mangaboos.\"\r\n\r\nIt appeared that these odd people, while they were able to walk through\r\nthe air with ease, usually moved upon the ground in the ordinary way.\r\nThere were no stairs in their houses, because they did not need them,\r\nbut on a level surface they generally walked just as we do.\r\n\r\nThe little party of strangers now followed the Prince across a few more\r\nof the glass bridges and along several paths until they came to a garden\r\nenclosed by a high hedge. Jim had refused to leave the field of grass,\r\nwhere he was engaged in busily eating; so the Wizard got out of the\r\nbuggy and joined Zeb and Dorothy, and the kitten followed demurely at\r\ntheir heels.\r\n\r\nInside the hedge they came upon row after row of large and handsome\r\nplants with broad leaves gracefully curving until their points nearly\r\nreached the ground. In the center of each plant grew a daintily dressed\r\nMangaboo, for the clothing of all these creatures grew upon them and was\r\nattached to their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe growing Mangaboos were of all sizes, from the blossom that had just\r\nturned into a wee baby to the full-grown and almost ripe man or woman.\r\nOn some of the bushes might be seen a bud, a blossom, a baby, a\r\nhalf-grown person and a ripe one; but even those ready to pluck were\r\nmotionless and silent, as if devoid of life. This sight explained to\r\nDorothy why she had seen no children among the Mangaboos, a thing she\r\nhad until now been unable to account for.\r\n\r\n\"Our people do not acquire their real life until they leave their\r\nbushes,\" said the Prince. \"You will notice they are all attached to the\r\nplants by the soles of their feet, and when they are quite ripe they are\r\neasily separated from the stems and at once attain the powers of motion\r\nand speech. So while they grow they cannot be said to really live, and\r\nthey must be picked before they can become good citizens.\"\r\n\r\n\"How long do you live, after you are picked?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"That depends upon the care we take of ourselves,\" he replied. \"If we\r\nkeep cool and moist, and meet with no accidents, we often live for five\r\nyears. I've been picked over six years, but our family is known to be\r\nespecially long lived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you eat?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Eat! No, indeed. We are quite solid inside our bodies, and have no need\r\nto eat, any more than does a potato.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the potatoes sometimes sprout,\" said Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"And sometimes we do,\" answered the Prince; \"but that is considered a\r\ngreat misfortune, for then we must be planted at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you grow?\" asked the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"I will show you,\" was the reply. \"Step this way, please.\"\r\n\r\nHe led them within another but smaller circle of hedge, where grew one\r\nlarge and beautiful bush.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said he, \"is the Royal Bush of the Mangaboos. All of our Princes\r\nand Rulers have grown upon this one bush from time immemorial.\"\r\n\r\nThey stood before it in silent admiration. On the central stalk stood\r\npoised the figure of a girl so exquisitely formed and colored and so\r\nlovely in the expression of her delicate features that Dorothy thought\r\nshe had never seen so sweet and adorable a creature in all her life.\r\nThe maiden's gown was soft as satin and fell about her in ample folds,\r\nwhile dainty lace-like traceries trimmed the bodice and sleeves. Her\r\nflesh was fine and smooth as polished ivory, and her poise expressed\r\nboth dignity and grace.\r\n\r\n\"Who is this?\" asked the Wizard, curiously.\r\n\r\nThe Prince had been staring hard at the girl on the bush. Now he\r\nanswered, with a touch of uneasiness in his cold tones:\r\n\r\n\"She is the Ruler destined to be my successor, for she is a Royal\r\nPrincess. When she becomes fully ripe I must abandon the sovereignty of\r\nthe Mangaboos to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't she ripe now?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\nHe hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"Not quite,\" said he, finally. \"It will be several days before she needs\r\nto be picked, or at least that is my judgment. I am in no hurry to\r\nresign my office and be planted, you may be sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably not,\" declared the Wizard, nodding.\r\n\r\n\"This is one of the most unpleasant things about our vegetable lives,\"\r\ncontinued the Prince, with a sigh, \"that while we are in our full prime\r\nwe must give way to another, and be covered up in the ground to sprout\r\nand grow and give birth to other people.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure the Princess is ready to be picked,\" asserted Dorothy, gazing\r\nhard at the beautiful girl on the bush. \"She's as perfect as she can\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" answered the Prince, hastily, \"she will be all right for a\r\nfew days longer, and it is best for me to rule until I can dispose of\r\nyou strangers, who have come to our land uninvited and must be attended\r\nto at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you going to do with us?\" asked Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"That is a matter I have not quite decided upon,\" was the reply. \"I\r\nthink I shall keep this Wizard until a new Sorcerer is ready to pick,\r\nfor he seems quite skillful and may be of use to us. But the rest of you\r\nmust be destroyed in some way, and you cannot be planted, because I do\r\nnot wish horses and cats and meat people growing all over our country.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't worry,\" said Dorothy. \"We wouldn't grow under ground, I'm\r\nsure.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why destroy my friends?\" asked the little Wizard. \"Why not let them\r\nlive?\"\r\n\r\n\"They do not belong here,\" returned the Prince. \"They have no right to\r\nbe inside the earth at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"We didn't ask to come down here; we fell,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"That is no excuse,\" declared the Prince, coldly.\r\n\r\nThe children looked at each other in perplexity, and the Wizard sighed.\r\nEureka rubbed her paw on her face and said in her soft, purring voice:\r\n\r\n\"He won't need to destroy _me_, for if I don't get something to eat\r\npretty soon I shall starve to death, and so save him the trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he planted you, he might grow some cat-tails,\" suggested the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Eureka! perhaps we can find you some milk-weeds to eat,\" said the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n\"Phoo!\" snarled the kitten; \"I wouldn't touch the nasty things!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't need milk, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy; \"you are big enough now\r\nto eat any kind of food.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I can get it,\" added Eureka.\r\n\r\n\"I'm hungry myself,\" said Zeb. \"But I noticed some strawberries growing\r\nin one of the gardens, and some melons in another place. These people\r\ndon't eat such things, so perhaps on our way back they will let us get\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind your hunger,\" interrupted the Prince. \"I shall order you\r\ndestroyed in a few minutes, so you will have no need to ruin our pretty\r\nmelon vines and berry bushes. Follow me, please, to meet your doom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5.\r\n\r\nDOROTHY PICKS THE PRINCESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words of the cold and moist vegetable Prince were not very\r\ncomforting, and as he spoke them he turned away and left the enclosure.\r\nThe children, feeling sad and despondent, were about to follow him when\r\nthe Wizard touched Dorothy softly on her shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we pick the Royal Princess,\" said the Wizard. \"I'm quite sure\r\nshe's ripe, and as soon as she comes to life she will be the Ruler, and\r\nmay treat us better than that heartless Prince intends to.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" exclaimed Dorothy, eagerly. \"Let's pick her while we have\r\nthe chance, before the man with the star comes back.\"\r\n\r\nSo together they leaned over the great bush and each of them seized one\r\nhand of the lovely Princess.\r\n\r\n\"Pull!\" cried Dorothy, and as they did so the royal lady leaned toward\r\nthem and the stems snapped and separated from her feet. She was not at\r\nall heavy, so the Wizard and Dorothy managed to lift her gently to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful creature passed her hands over her eyes an instant, tucked\r\nin a stray lock of hair that had become disarranged, and after a look\r\naround the garden made those present a gracious bow and said, in a sweet\r\nbut even toned voice:\r\n\r\n\"I thank you very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"We salute your Royal Highness!\" cried the Wizard, kneeling and kissing\r\nher hand.\r\n\r\nJust then the voice of the Prince was heard calling upon them to hasten,\r\nand a moment later he returned to the enclosure, followed by a number of\r\nhis people.\r\n\r\nInstantly the Princess turned and faced him, and when he saw that she\r\nwas picked the Prince stood still and began to tremble.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the Royal Lady, with much dignity, \"you have wronged me\r\ngreatly, and would have wronged me still more had not these strangers\r\ncome to my rescue. I have been ready for picking all the past week, but\r\nbecause you were selfish and desired to continue your unlawful rule,\r\nyou left me to stand silent upon my bush.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know that you were ripe,\" answered the Prince, in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Give me the Star of Royalty!\" she commanded.\r\n\r\nSlowly he took the shining star from his own brow and placed it upon\r\nthat of the Princess. Then all the people bowed low to her, and the\r\nPrince turned and walked away alone. What became of him afterward our\r\nfriends never knew.\r\n\r\nThe people of Mangaboo now formed themselves into a procession and\r\nmarched toward the glass city to escort their new ruler to her palace\r\nand to perform those ceremonies proper to the occasion. But while the\r\npeople in the procession walked upon the ground the Princess walked in\r\nthe air just above their heads, to show that she was a superior being\r\nand more exalted than her subjects.\r\n\r\nNo one now seemed to pay any attention to the strangers, so Dorothy and\r\nZeb and the Wizard let the train pass on and then wandered by themselves\r\ninto the vegetable gardens. They did not bother to cross the bridges\r\nover the brooks, but when they came to a stream they stepped high and\r\nwalked in the air to the other side. This was a very interesting\r\nexperience to them, and Dorothy said:\r\n\r\n\"I wonder why it is that we can walk so easily in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" answered the Wizard, \"it is because we are close to the\r\ncenter of the earth, where the attraction of gravitation is very slight.\r\nBut I've noticed that many queer things happen in fairy countries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this a fairy country?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is,\" returned Dorothy, promptly. \"Only a fairy country\r\ncould have veg'table people; and only in a fairy country could Eureka\r\nand Jim talk as we do.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" said Zeb, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable gardens they found the strawberries and melons, and\r\nseveral other unknown but delicious fruits, of which they ate heartily.\r\nBut the kitten bothered them constantly by demanding milk or meat, and\r\ncalled the Wizard names because he could not bring her a dish of milk by\r\nmeans of his magical arts.\r\n\r\nAs they sat upon the grass watching Jim, who was still busily eating,\r\nEureka said:\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe you are a Wizard at all!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the little man, \"you are quite right. In the strict sense\r\nof the word I am not a Wizard, but only a humbug.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Wizard of Oz has always been a humbug,\" agreed Dorothy. \"I've known\r\nhim for a long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is so,\" said the boy, \"how could he do that wonderful trick\r\nwith the nine tiny piglets?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't know,\" said Dorothy, \"but it must have been humbug.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" declared the Wizard, nodding at her. \"It was necessary to\r\ndeceive that ugly Sorcerer and the Prince, as well as their stupid\r\npeople; but I don't mind telling you, who are my friends, that the thing\r\nwas only a trick.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I saw the little pigs with my own eyes!\" exclaimed Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"So did I,\" purred the kitten.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" answered the Wizard. \"You saw them because they were\r\nthere. They are in my inside pocket now. But the pulling of them apart\r\nand pushing them together again was only a sleight-of-hand trick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's see the pigs,\" said Eureka, eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe little man felt carefully in his pocket and pulled out the tiny\r\npiglets, setting them upon the grass one by one, where they ran around\r\nand nibbled the tender blades.\r\n\r\n\"They're hungry, too,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, what cunning things!\" cried Dorothy, catching up one and petting\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful!\" said the piglet, with a squeal, \"you're squeezing me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" murmured the Wizard, looking at his pets in astonishment.\r\n\"They can actually talk!\"\r\n\r\n\"May I eat one of them?\" asked the kitten, in a pleading voice. \"I'm\r\nawfully hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Eureka,\" said Dorothy, reproachfully, \"what a cruel question! It\r\nwould be dreadful to eat these dear little things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should say so!\" grunted another of the piglets, looking uneasily at\r\nthe kitten; \"cats are cruel things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not cruel,\" replied the kitten, yawning. \"I'm just hungry.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot eat my piglets, even if you are starving,\" declared the\r\nlittle man, in a stern voice. \"They are the only things I have to prove\r\nI'm a wizard.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did they happen to be so little?\" asked Dorothy. \"I never saw such\r\nsmall pigs before.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are from the Island of Teenty-Weent,\" said the Wizard, \"where\r\neverything is small because it's a small island. A sailor brought them\r\nto Los Angeles and I gave him nine tickets to the circus for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what am I going to eat?\" wailed the kitten, sitting in front of\r\nDorothy and looking pleadingly into her face. \"There are no cows here\r\nto give milk; or any mice, or even grasshoppers. And if I can't eat the\r\npiglets you may as well plant me at once and raise catsup.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have an idea,\" said the Wizard, \"that there are fishes in these\r\nbrooks. Do you like fish?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fish!\" cried the kitten. \"Do I like fish? Why, they're better than\r\npiglets--or even milk!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll try to catch you some,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"But won't they be veg'table, like everything else here?\" asked the\r\nkitten.\r\n\r\n\"I think not. Fishes are not animals, and they are as cold and moist as\r\nthe vegetables themselves. There is no reason, that I can see, why they\r\nmay not exist in the waters of this strange country.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Wizard bent a pin for a hook and took a long piece of string\r\nfrom his pocket for a fish-line. The only bait he could find was a\r\nbright red blossom from a flower; but he knew fishes are easy to fool if\r\nanything bright attracts their attention, so he decided to try the\r\nblossom. Having thrown the end of his line in the water of a nearby\r\nbrook he soon felt a sharp tug that told him a fish had bitten and was\r\ncaught on the bent pin; so the little man drew in the string and, sure\r\nenough, the fish came with it and was landed safely on the shore,\r\nwhere it began to flop around in great excitement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE GARDEN OF THE MANGABOOS.]\r\n\r\nThe fish was fat and round, and its scales glistened like beautifully\r\ncut jewels set close together; but there was no time to examine it\r\nclosely, for Eureka made a jump and caught it between her claws, and in\r\na few moments it had entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy, \"did you eat the bones?\"\r\n\r\n\"If it had any bones, I ate them,\" replied the kitten, composedly, as it\r\nwashed its face after the meal. \"But I don't think that fish had any\r\nbones, because I didn't feel them scratch my throat.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were very greedy,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I was very hungry,\" replied the kitten.\r\n\r\nThe little pigs had stood huddled in a group, watching this scene with\r\nfrightened eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Cats are dreadful creatures!\" said one of them.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad we are not fishes!\" said another.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" Dorothy murmured, soothingly, \"I'll not let the kitten\r\nhurt you.\"\r\n\r\nThen she happened to remember that in a corner of her suit-case were one\r\nor two crackers that were left over from her luncheon on the train, and\r\nshe went to the buggy and brought them. Eureka stuck up her nose at such\r\nfood, but the tiny piglets squealed delightedly at the sight of the\r\ncrackers and ate them up in a jiffy.\r\n\r\n\"Now let us go back to the city,\" suggested the Wizard. \"That is, if Jim\r\nhas had enough of the pink grass.\"\r\n\r\nThe cab-horse, who was browsing near, lifted his head with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"I've tried to eat a lot while I had the chance,\" said he, \"for it's\r\nlikely to be a long while between meals in this strange country. But I'm\r\nready to go, now, at any time you wish.\"\r\n\r\nSo, after the Wizard had put the piglets back into his inside pocket,\r\nwhere they cuddled up and went to sleep, the three climbed into the\r\nbuggy and Jim started back to the town.\r\n\r\n\"Where shall we stay?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"I think I shall take possession of the House of the Sorcerer,\" replied\r\nthe Wizard; \"for the Prince said in the presence of his people that he\r\nwould keep me until they picked another Sorcerer, and the new Princess\r\nwon't know but that we belong there.\"\r\n\r\nThey agreed to this plan, and when they reached the great square Jim\r\ndrew the buggy into the big door of the domed hall.\r\n\r\n\"It doesn't look very homelike,\" said Dorothy, gazing around at the\r\nbare room. \"But it's a place to stay, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are those holes up there?\" enquired the boy, pointing to some\r\nopenings that appeared near the top of the dome.\r\n\r\n\"They look like doorways,\" said Dorothy; \"only there are no stairs to\r\nget to them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget that stairs are unnecessary,\" observed the Wizard. \"Let us\r\nwalk up, and see where the doors lead to.\"\r\n\r\nWith this he began walking in the air toward the high openings, and\r\nDorothy and Zeb followed him. It was the same sort of climb one\r\nexperiences when walking up a hill, and they were nearly out of breath\r\nwhen they came to the row of openings, which they perceived to be\r\ndoorways leading into halls in the upper part of the house. Following\r\nthese halls they discovered many small rooms opening from them, and some\r\nwere furnished with glass benches, tables and chairs. But there were no\r\nbeds at all.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if these people never sleep,\" said the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Why, there seems to be no night at all in this country,\" Zeb replied.\r\n\"Those colored suns are exactly in the same place they were when we\r\ncame, and if there is no sunset there can be no night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" agreed the Wizard. \"But it is a long time since I have had\r\nany sleep, and I'm tired. So I think I shall lie down upon one of these\r\nhard glass benches and take a nap.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will, too,\" said Dorothy, and chose a little room at the end of the\r\nhall.\r\n\r\nZeb walked down again to unharness Jim, who, when he found himself free,\r\nrolled over a few times and then settled down to sleep, with Eureka\r\nnestling comfortably beside his big, boney body. Then the boy returned\r\nto one of the upper rooms, and in spite of the hardness of the glass\r\nbench was soon deep in slumberland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6.\r\n\r\nTHE MANGABOOS PROVE DANGEROUS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Wizard awoke the six colored suns were shining down upon the\r\nLand of the Mangaboos just as they had done ever since his arrival. The\r\nlittle man, having had a good sleep, felt rested and refreshed, and\r\nlooking through the glass partition of the room he saw Zeb sitting up on\r\nhis bench and yawning. So the Wizard went in to him.\r\n\r\n\"Zeb,\" said he, \"my balloon is of no further use in this strange\r\ncountry, so I may as well leave it on the square where it fell. But in\r\nthe basket-car are some things I would like to keep with me. I wish you\r\nwould go and fetch my satchel, two lanterns, and a can of kerosene oil\r\nthat is under the seat. There is nothing else that I care about.\"\r\n\r\nSo the boy went willingly upon the errand, and by the time he had\r\nreturned Dorothy was awake. Then the three held a counsel to decide what\r\nthey should do next, but could think of no way to better their\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like these veg'table people,\" said the little girl. \"They're\r\ncold and flabby, like cabbages, in spite of their prettiness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I agree with you. It is because there is no warm blood in them,\"\r\nremarked the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"And they have no hearts; so they can't love anyone--not even\r\nthemselves,\" declared the boy.\r\n\r\n\"The Princess is lovely to look at,\" continued Dorothy, thoughtfully;\r\n\"but I don't care much for her, after all. If there was any other place\r\nto go, I'd like to go there.\"\r\n\r\n\"But _is_ there any other place?\" asked the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" she answered.\r\n\r\nJust then they heard the big voice of Jim the cab-horse calling to them,\r\nand going to the doorway leading to the dome they found the Princess and\r\na throng of her people had entered the House of the Sorcerer.\r\n\r\nSo they went down to greet the beautiful vegetable lady, who said to\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n\"I have been talking with my advisors about you meat people, and we have\r\ndecided that you do not belong in the Land of the Mangaboos and must not\r\nremain here.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can we go away?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you cannot go away, of course; so you must be destroyed,\" was the\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\"In what way?\" enquired the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"We shall throw you three people into the Garden of the Twining Vines,\"\r\nsaid the Princess, \"and they will soon crush you and devour your bodies\r\nto make themselves grow bigger. The animals you have with you we will\r\ndrive to the mountains and put into the Black Pit. Then our country will\r\nbe rid of all its unwelcome visitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are in need of a Sorcerer,\" said the Wizard, \"and not one of\r\nthose growing is yet ripe enough to pick. I am greater than any\r\nthorn-covered sorcerer that ever grew in your garden. Why destroy me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true we need a Sorcerer,\" acknowledged the Princess, \"but I am\r\ninformed that one of our own will be ready to pick in a few days, to\r\ntake the place of Gwig, whom you cut in two before it was time for him\r\nto be planted. Let us see your arts, and the sorceries you are able to\r\nperform. Then I will decide whether to destroy you with the others or\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\nAt this the Wizard made a bow to the people and repeated his trick of\r\nproducing the nine tiny piglets and making them disappear again. He did\r\nit very cleverly, indeed, and the Princess looked at the strange\r\npiglets as if she were as truly astonished as any vegetable person could\r\nbe. But afterward she said:\r\n\r\n\"I have heard of this wonderful magic. But it accomplishes nothing of\r\nvalue. What else can you do?\"\r\n\r\nThe Wizard tried to think. Then he jointed together the blades of his\r\nsword and balanced it very skillfully upon the end of his nose. But even\r\nthat did not satisfy the Princess.\r\n\r\nJust then his eye fell upon the lanterns and the can of kerosene oil\r\nwhich Zeb had brought from the car of his balloon, and he got a clever\r\nidea from those commonplace things.\r\n\r\n\"Your Highness,\" said he, \"I will now proceed to prove my magic by\r\ncreating two suns that you have never seen before; also I will exhibit a\r\nDestroyer much more dreadful than your Clinging Vines.\"\r\n\r\nSo he placed Dorothy upon one side of him and the boy upon the other and\r\nset a lantern upon each of their heads.\r\n\r\n\"Don't laugh,\" he whispered to them, \"or you will spoil the effect of my\r\nmagic.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"NOW, PRINCESS,\" EXCLAIMED THE WIZARD.]\r\n\r\nThen, with much dignity and a look of vast importance upon his wrinkled\r\nface, the Wizard got out his match-box and lighted the two lanterns. The\r\nglare they made was very small when compared with the radiance of the\r\nsix great colored suns; but still they gleamed steadily and clearly. The\r\nMangaboos were much impressed because they had never before seen any\r\nlight that did not come directly from their suns.\r\n\r\nNext the Wizard poured a pool of oil from the can upon the glass floor,\r\nwhere it covered quite a broad surface. When he lighted the oil a\r\nhundred tongues of flame shot up, and the effect was really imposing.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Princess,\" exclaimed the Wizard, \"those of your advisors who\r\nwished to throw us into the Garden of Clinging Vines must step within\r\nthis circle of light. If they advised you well, and were in the right,\r\nthey will not be injured in any way. But if any advised you wrongly, the\r\nlight will wither him.\"\r\n\r\nThe advisors of the Princess did not like this test; but she commanded\r\nthem to step into the flame and one by one they did so, and were\r\nscorched so badly that the air was soon filled with an odor like that of\r\nbaked potatoes. Some of the Mangaboos fell down and had to be dragged\r\nfrom the fire, and all were so withered that it would be necessary to\r\nplant them at once.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the Princess to the Wizard, \"you are greater than any\r\nSorcerer we have ever known. As it is evident that my people have\r\nadvised me wrongly, I will not cast you three people into the dreadful\r\nGarden of the Clinging Vines; but your animals must be driven into the\r\nBlack Pit in the mountain, for my subjects cannot bear to have them\r\naround.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wizard was so pleased to have saved the two children and himself\r\nthat he said nothing against this decree; but when the Princess had gone\r\nboth Jim and Eureka protested they did not want to go to the Black Pit,\r\nand Dorothy promised she would do all that she could to save them from\r\nsuch a fate.\r\n\r\nFor two or three days after this--if we call days the periods between\r\nsleep, there being no night to divide the hours into days--our friends\r\nwere not disturbed in any way. They were even permitted to occupy the\r\nHouse of the Sorcerer in peace, as if it had been their own, and to\r\nwander in the gardens in search of food.\r\n\r\nOnce they came near to the enclosed Garden of the Clinging Vines, and\r\nwalking high into the air looked down upon it with much interest. They\r\nsaw a mass of tough green vines all matted together and writhing and\r\ntwisting around like a nest of great snakes. Everything the vines\r\ntouched they crushed, and our adventurers were indeed thankful to have\r\nescaped being cast among them.\r\n\r\nWhenever the Wizard went to sleep he would take the nine tiny piglets\r\nfrom his pocket and let them run around on the floor of his room to\r\namuse themselves and get some exercise; and one time they found his\r\nglass door ajar and wandered into the hall and then into the bottom part\r\nof the great dome, walking through the air as easily as Eureka could.\r\nThey knew the kitten, by this time, so they scampered over to where she\r\nlay beside Jim and commenced to frisk and play with her.\r\n\r\nThe cab-horse, who never slept long at a time, sat upon his haunches and\r\nwatched the tiny piglets and the kitten with much approval.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be rough!\" he would call out, if Eureka knocked over one of the\r\nround, fat piglets with her paw; but the pigs never minded, and enjoyed\r\nthe sport very greatly.\r\n\r\nSuddenly they looked up to find the room filled with the silent,\r\nsolemn-eyed Mangaboos. Each of the vegetable folks bore a branch covered\r\nwith sharp thorns, which was thrust defiantly toward the horse, the\r\nkitten and the piglets.\r\n\r\n\"Here--stop this foolishness!\" Jim roared, angrily; but after being\r\npricked once or twice he got upon his four legs and kept out of the way\r\nof the thorns.\r\n\r\nThe Mangaboos surrounded them in solid ranks, but left an opening to the\r\ndoorway of the hall; so the animals slowly retreated until they were\r\ndriven from the room and out upon the street. Here were more of the\r\nvegetable people with thorns, and silently they urged the now frightened\r\ncreatures down the street. Jim had to be careful not to step upon the\r\ntiny piglets, who scampered under his feet grunting and squealing, while\r\nEureka, snarling and biting at the thorns pushed toward her, also tried\r\nto protect the pretty little things from injury. Slowly but steadily the\r\nheartless Mangaboos drove them on, until they had passed through the\r\ncity and the gardens and come to the broad plains leading to the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\n\"What does all this mean, anyhow?\" asked the horse, jumping to escape a\r\nthorn.\r\n\r\n\"Why, they are driving us toward the Black Pit, into which they\r\nthreatened to cast us,\" replied the kitten. \"If I were as big as you\r\nare, Jim, I'd fight these miserable turnip-roots!\"\r\n\r\n\"What would you do?\" enquired Jim.\r\n\r\n\"I'd kick out with those long legs and iron-shod hoofs.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the horse; \"I'll do it.\"\r\n\r\nAn instant later he suddenly backed toward the crowd of Mangaboos and\r\nkicked out his hind legs as hard as he could. A dozen of them smashed\r\ntogether and tumbled to the ground, and seeing his success Jim kicked\r\nagain and again, charging into the vegetable crowd, knocking them in\r\nall directions and sending the others scattering to escape his iron\r\nheels. Eureka helped him by flying into the faces of the enemy and\r\nscratching and biting furiously, and the kitten ruined so many vegetable\r\ncomplexions that the Mangaboos feared her as much as they did the horse.\r\n\r\nBut the foes were too many to be repulsed for long. They tired Jim and\r\nEureka out, and although the field of battle was thickly covered with\r\nmashed and disabled Mangaboos, our animal friends had to give up at last\r\nand allow themselves to be driven to the mountain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7.\r\n\r\nINTO THE BLACK PIT AND OUT AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they came to the mountain it proved to be a rugged, towering chunk\r\nof deep green glass, and looked dismal and forbidding in the extreme.\r\nHalf way up the steep was a yawning cave, black as night beyond the\r\npoint where the rainbow rays of the colored suns reached into it.\r\n\r\nThe Mangaboos drove the horse and the kitten and the piglets into this\r\ndark hole and then, having pushed the buggy in after them--for it seemed\r\nsome of them had dragged it all the way from the domed hall--they began\r\nto pile big glass rocks within the entrance, so that the prisoners could\r\nnot get out again.\r\n\r\n\"This is dreadful!\" groaned Jim. \"It will be about the end of our\r\nadventures, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the Wizard was here,\" said one of the piglets, sobbing bitterly, \"he\r\nwould not see us suffer so.\"\r\n\r\n\"We ought to have called him and Dorothy when we were first attacked,\"\r\nadded Eureka. \"But never mind; be brave, my friends, and I will go and\r\ntell our masters where you are, and get them to come to your rescue.\"\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the hole was nearly filled up now, but the kitten gave a\r\nleap through the remaining opening and at once scampered up into the\r\nair. The Mangaboos saw her escape, and several of them caught up their\r\nthorns and gave chase, mounting through the air after her. Eureka,\r\nhowever, was lighter than the Mangaboos, and while they could mount only\r\nabout a hundred feet above the earth the kitten found she could go\r\nnearly two hundred feet. So she ran along over their heads until she had\r\nleft them far behind and below and had come to the city and the House of\r\nthe Sorcerer. There she entered in at Dorothy's window in the dome and\r\naroused her from her sleep.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the little girl knew what had happened she awakened the\r\nWizard and Zeb, and at once preparations were made to go to the rescue\r\nof Jim and the piglets. The Wizard carried his satchel, which was quite\r\nheavy, and Zeb carried the two lanterns and the oil can. Dorothy's\r\nwicker suit-case was still under the seat of the buggy, and by good\r\nfortune the boy had also placed the harness in the buggy when he had\r\ntaken it off from Jim to let the horse lie down and rest. So there was\r\nnothing for the girl to carry but the kitten, which she held close to\r\nher bosom and tried to comfort, for its little heart was still beating\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nSome of the Mangaboos discovered them as soon as they left the House of\r\nthe Sorcerer; but when they started toward the mountain the vegetable\r\npeople allowed them to proceed without interference, yet followed in a\r\ncrowd behind them so that they could not go back again.\r\n\r\nBefore long they neared the Black Pit, where a busy swarm of Mangaboos,\r\nheaded by their Princess, was engaged in piling up glass rocks before\r\nthe entrance.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, I command you!\" cried the Wizard, in an angry tone, and at once\r\nbegan pulling down the rocks to liberate Jim and the piglets. Instead of\r\nopposing him in this they stood back in silence until he had made a\r\ngood-sized hole in the barrier, when by order of the Princess they all\r\nsprang forward and thrust out their sharp thorns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THROUGH THE BLACK PIT.]\r\n\r\nDorothy hopped inside the opening to escape being pricked, and Zeb and\r\nthe Wizard, after enduring a few stabs from the thorns, were glad to\r\nfollow her. At once the Mangaboos began piling up the rocks of glass\r\nagain, and as the little man realized that they were all about to be\r\nentombed in the mountain he said to the children:\r\n\r\n\"My dears, what shall we do? Jump out and fight?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the use?\" replied Dorothy. \"I'd as soon die here as live much\r\nlonger among those cruel and heartless people.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the way I feel about it,\" remarked Zeb, rubbing his wounds.\r\n\"I've had enough of the Mangaboos.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the Wizard; \"I'm with you, whatever you decide. But we\r\ncan't live long in this cavern, that's certain.\"\r\n\r\nNoticing that the light was growing dim he picked up his nine piglets,\r\npatted each one lovingly on its fat little head, and placed them\r\ncarefully in his inside pocket.\r\n\r\nZeb struck a match and lighted one of the lanterns. The rays of the\r\ncolored suns were now shut out from them forever, for the last chinks\r\nhad been filled up in the wall that separated their prison from the Land\r\nof the Mangaboos.\r\n\r\n\"How big is this hole?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"I'll explore it and see,\" replied the boy.\r\n\r\nSo he carried the lantern back for quite a distance, while Dorothy and\r\nthe Wizard followed at his side. The cavern did not come to an end, as\r\nthey had expected it would, but slanted upward through the great glass\r\nmountain, running in a direction that promised to lead them to the side\r\nopposite the Mangaboo country.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't a bad road,\" observed the Wizard, \"and if we followed it it\r\nmight lead us to some place that is more comfortable than this black\r\npocket we are now in. I suppose the vegetable folk were always afraid to\r\nenter this cavern because it is dark; but we have our lanterns to light\r\nthe way, so I propose that we start out and discover where this tunnel\r\nin the mountain leads to.\"\r\n\r\nThe others agreed readily to this sensible suggestion, and at once the\r\nboy began to harness Jim to the buggy. When all was in readiness the\r\nthree took their seats in the buggy and Jim started cautiously along the\r\nway, Zeb driving while the Wizard and Dorothy each held a lighted\r\nlantern so the horse could see where to go.\r\n\r\nSometimes the tunnel was so narrow that the wheels of the buggy grazed\r\nthe sides; then it would broaden out as wide as a street; but the floor\r\nwas usually smooth, and for a long time they travelled on without any\r\naccident. Jim stopped sometimes to rest, for the climb was rather steep\r\nand tiresome.\r\n\r\n\"We must be nearly as high as the six colored suns, by this time,\" said\r\nDorothy. \"I didn't know this mountain was so tall.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are certainly a good distance away from the Land of the Mangaboos,\"\r\nadded Zeb; \"for we have slanted away from it ever since we started.\"\r\n\r\nBut they kept steadily moving, and just as Jim was about tired out with\r\nhis long journey the way suddenly grew lighter, and Zeb put out the\r\nlanterns to save the oil.\r\n\r\nTo their joy they found it was a white light that now greeted them, for\r\nall were weary of the colored rainbow lights which, after a time, had\r\nmade their eyes ache with their constantly shifting rays. The sides of\r\nthe tunnel showed before them like the inside of a long spy-glass, and\r\nthe floor became more level. Jim hastened his lagging steps at this\r\nassurance of a quick relief from the dark passage, and in a few moments\r\nmore they had emerged from the mountain and found themselves face to\r\nface with a new and charming country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8.\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF VOICES\r\n\r\n\r\nBy journeying through the glass mountain they had reached a delightful\r\nvalley that was shaped like the hollow of a great cup, with another\r\nrugged mountain showing on the other side of it, and soft and pretty\r\ngreen hills at the ends. It was all laid out into lovely lawns and\r\ngardens, with pebble paths leading through them and groves of beautiful\r\nand stately trees dotting the landscape here and there. There were\r\norchards, too, bearing luscious fruits that are all unknown in our\r\nworld. Alluring brooks of crystal water flowed sparkling between their\r\nflower-strewn banks, while scattered over the valley were dozens of the\r\nquaintest and most picturesque cottages our travelers had ever beheld.\r\nNone of them were in clusters, such as villages or towns, but each had\r\nample grounds of its own, with orchards and gardens surrounding it.\r\n\r\nAs the new arrivals gazed upon this exquisite scene they were enraptured\r\nby its beauties and the fragrance that permeated the soft air, which\r\nthey breathed so gratefully after the confined atmosphere of the tunnel.\r\nSeveral minutes were consumed in silent admiration before they noticed\r\ntwo very singular and unusual facts about this valley. One was that it\r\nwas lighted from some unseen source; for no sun or moon was in the\r\narched blue sky, although every object was flooded with a clear and\r\nperfect light. The second and even more singular fact was the absence of\r\nany inhabitant of this splendid place. From their elevated position they\r\ncould overlook the entire valley, but not a single moving object could\r\nthey see. All appeared mysteriously deserted.\r\n\r\nThe mountain on this side was not glass, but made of a stone similar to\r\ngranite. With some difficulty and danger Jim drew the buggy over the\r\nloose rocks until he reached the green lawns below, where the paths and\r\norchards and gardens began. The nearest cottage was still some distance\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it fine?\" cried Dorothy, in a joyous voice, as she sprang out of\r\nthe buggy and let Eureka run frolicking over the velvety grass.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed!\" answered Zeb. \"We were lucky to get away from those\r\ndreadful vegetable people.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wouldn't be so bad,\" remarked the Wizard, gazing around him, \"if we\r\nwere obliged to live here always. We couldn't find a prettier place, I'm\r\nsure.\"\r\n\r\nHe took the piglets from his pocket and let them run on the grass, and\r\nJim tasted a mouthful of the green blades and declared he was very\r\ncontented in his new surroundings.\r\n\r\n\"We can't walk in the air here, though,\" called Eureka, who had tried it\r\nand failed; but the others were satisfied to walk on the ground, and the\r\nWizard said they must be nearer the surface of the earth than they had\r\nbeen in the Mangaboo country, for everything was more homelike and\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\n\"But where are the people?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\nThe little man shook his bald head.\r\n\r\n\"Can't imagine, my dear,\" he replied.\r\n\r\nThey heard the sudden twittering of a bird, but could not find the\r\ncreature anywhere. Slowly they walked along the path toward the nearest\r\ncottage, the piglets racing and gambolling beside them and Jim pausing\r\nat every step for another mouthful of grass.\r\n\r\nPresently they came to a low plant which had broad, spreading leaves, in\r\nthe center of which grew a single fruit about as large as a peach. The\r\nfruit was so daintily colored and so fragrant, and looked so appetizing\r\nand delicious that Dorothy stopped and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"What is it, do you s'pose?\"\r\n\r\nThe piglets had smelled the fruit quickly, and before the girl could\r\nreach out her hand to pluck it every one of the nine tiny ones had\r\nrushed in and commenced to devour it with great eagerness.\r\n\r\n\"It's good, anyway,\" said Zeb, \"or those little rascals wouldn't have\r\ngobbled it up so greedily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are they?\" asked Dorothy, in astonishment.\r\n\r\nThey all looked around, but the piglets had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" cried the Wizard; \"they must have run away. But I didn't see\r\nthem go; did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" replied the boy and the girl, together.\r\n\r\n\"Here,--piggy, piggy, piggy!\" called their master, anxiously.\r\n\r\nSeveral squeals and grunts were instantly heard at his feet, but the\r\nWizard could not discover a single piglet.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Why, right beside you,\" spoke a tiny voice. \"Can't you see us?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"ARE THERE REALLY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM?\"]\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the little man, in a puzzled tone.\r\n\r\n\"We can see you,\" said another of the piglets.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard stooped down and put out his hand, and at once felt the small\r\nfat body of one of his pets. He picked it up, but could not see what he\r\nheld.\r\n\r\n\"It is very strange,\" said he, soberly. \"The piglets have become\r\ninvisible, in some curious way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll bet it's because they ate that peach!\" cried the kitten.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't a peach, Eureka,\" said Dorothy. \"I only hope it wasn't\r\npoison.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was fine, Dorothy,\" called one of the piglets.\r\n\r\n\"We'll eat all we can find of them,\" said another.\r\n\r\n\"But _we_ mus'n't eat them,\" the Wizard warned the children, \"or we too\r\nmay become invisible, and lose each other. If we come across another of\r\nthe strange fruit we must avoid it.\"\r\n\r\nCalling the piglets to him he picked them all up, one by one, and put\r\nthem away in his pocket; for although he could not see them he could\r\nfeel them, and when he had buttoned his coat he knew they were safe for\r\nthe present.\r\n\r\nThe travellers now resumed their walk toward the cottage, which they\r\npresently reached. It was a pretty place, with vines growing thickly\r\nover the broad front porch. The door stood open and a table was set in\r\nthe front room, with four chairs drawn up to it. On the table were\r\nplates, knives and forks, and dishes of bread, meat and fruits. The meat\r\nwas smoking hot and the knives and forks were performing strange antics\r\nand jumping here and there in quite a puzzling way. But not a single\r\nperson appeared to be in the room.\r\n\r\n\"How funny!\" exclaimed Dorothy, who with Zeb and the Wizard now stood in\r\nthe doorway.\r\n\r\nA peal of merry laughter answered her, and the knives and forks fell to\r\nthe plates with a clatter. One of the chairs pushed back from the table,\r\nand this was so astonishing and mysterious that Dorothy was almost\r\ntempted to run away in fright.\r\n\r\n\"Here are strangers, mama!\" cried the shrill and childish voice of some\r\nunseen person.\r\n\r\n\"So I see, my dear,\" answered another voice, soft and womanly.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" demanded a third voice, in a stern, gruff accent.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" said the Wizard; \"are there really people in this room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" replied the man's voice.\r\n\r\n\"And--pardon me for the foolish question--but, are you all invisible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" the woman answered, repeating her low, rippling laughter.\r\n\"Are you surprised that you are unable to see the people of Voe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" stammered the Wizard. \"All the people I have ever met before\r\nwere very plain to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where do you come from, then?\" asked the woman, in a curious tone.\r\n\r\n\"We belong upon the face of the earth,\" explained the Wizard, \"but\r\nrecently, during an earthquake, we fell down a crack and landed in the\r\nCountry of the Mangaboos.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dreadful creatures!\" exclaimed the woman's voice. \"I've heard of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"They walled us up in a mountain,\" continued the Wizard; \"but we found\r\nthere was a tunnel through to this side, so we came here. It is a\r\nbeautiful place. What do you call it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the Valley of Voe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. We have seen no people since we arrived, so we came to this\r\nhouse to enquire our way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you hungry?\" asked the woman's voice.\r\n\r\n\"I could eat something,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"So could I,\" added Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"But we do not wish to intrude, I assure you,\" the Wizard hastened to\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" returned the man's voice, more pleasantly than\r\nbefore. \"You are welcome to what we have.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke the voice came so near to Zeb that he jumped back in alarm.\r\nTwo childish voices laughed merrily at this action, and Dorothy was sure\r\nthey were in no danger among such light-hearted folks, even if those\r\nfolks couldn't be seen.\r\n\r\n\"What curious animal is that which is eating the grass on my lawn?\"\r\nenquired the man's voice.\r\n\r\n\"That's Jim,\" said the girl. \"He's a horse.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is he good for?\" was the next question.\r\n\r\n\"He draws the buggy you see fastened to him, and we ride in the buggy\r\ninstead of walking,\" she explained.\r\n\r\n\"Can he fight?\" asked the man's voice.\r\n\r\n\"No! he can kick pretty hard with his heels, and bite a little; but Jim\r\ncan't 'zactly fight,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Then the bears will get him,\" said one of the children's voices.\r\n\r\n\"Bears!\" exclaimed Dorothy. \"Are these bears here?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the one evil of our country,\" answered the invisible man. \"Many\r\nlarge and fierce bears roam in the Valley of Voe, and when they can\r\ncatch any of us they eat us up; but as they cannot see us, we seldom get\r\ncaught.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are the bears invis'ble, too?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; for they eat of the dama-fruit, as we all do, and that keeps them\r\nfrom being seen by any eye, whether human or animal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does the dama-fruit grow on a low bush, and look something like a\r\npeach?\" asked the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"If it makes you invis'ble, why do you eat it?\" Dorothy enquired.\r\n\r\n\"For two reasons, my dear,\" the woman's voice answered. \"The dama-fruit\r\nis the most delicious thing that grows, and when it makes us invisible\r\nthe bears cannot find us to eat us up. But now, good wanderers, your\r\nluncheon is on the table, so please sit down and eat as much as you\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9.\r\n\r\nTHEY FIGHT THE INVISIBLE BEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strangers took their seats at the table willingly enough, for they\r\nwere all hungry and the platters were now heaped with good things to\r\neat. In front of each place was a plate bearing one of the delicious\r\ndama-fruit, and the perfume that rose from these was so enticing and\r\nsweet that they were sorely tempted to eat of them and become invisible.\r\n\r\nBut Dorothy satisfied her hunger with other things, and her companions\r\ndid likewise, resisting the temptation.\r\n\r\n\"Why do you not eat the damas?\" asked the woman's voice.\r\n\r\n\"We don't want to get invis'ble,\" answered the girl.\r\n\r\n\"But if you remain visible the bears will see you and devour you,\" said\r\na girlish young voice, that belonged to one of the children. \"We who\r\nlive here much prefer to be invisible; for we can still hug and kiss one\r\nanother, and are quite safe from the bears.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we do not have to be so particular about our dress,\" remarked the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\"And mama can't tell whether my face is dirty or not!\" added the other\r\nchildish voice, gleefully.\r\n\r\n\"But I make you wash it, every time I think of it,\" said the mother;\r\n\"for it stands to reason your face is dirty, Ianu, whether I can see it\r\nor not.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy laughed and stretched out her hands.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, please--Ianu and your sister--and let me feel of you,\" she\r\nrequested.\r\n\r\nThey came to her willingly, and Dorothy passed her hands over their\r\nfaces and forms and decided one was a girl of about her own age and the\r\nother a boy somewhat smaller. The girl's hair was soft and fluffy and\r\nher skin as smooth as satin. When Dorothy gently touched her nose and\r\nears and lips they seemed to be well and delicately formed.\r\n\r\n\"If I could see you I am sure you would be beautiful,\" she declared.\r\n\r\nThe girl laughed, and her mother said:\r\n\r\n\"We are not vain in the Valley of Voe, because we can not display our\r\nbeauty, and good actions and pleasant ways are what make us lovely to\r\nour companions. Yet we can see and appreciate the beauties of nature,\r\nthe dainty flowers and trees, the green fields and the clear blue of the\r\nsky.\"\r\n\r\n\"How about the birds and beasts and fishes?\" asked Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"The birds we cannot see, because they love to eat of the damas as much\r\nas we do; yet we hear their sweet songs and enjoy them. Neither can we\r\nsee the cruel bears, for they also eat the fruit. But the fishes that\r\nswim in our brooks we can see, and often we catch them to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"It occurs to me you have a great deal to make you happy, even while\r\ninvisible,\" remarked the Wizard. \"Nevertheless, we prefer to remain\r\nvisible while we are in your valley.\"\r\n\r\nJust then Eureka came in, for she had been until now wandering outside\r\nwith Jim; and when the kitten saw the table set with food she cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Now you must feed me, Dorothy, for I'm half starved.\"\r\n\r\nThe children were inclined to be frightened by the sight of the small\r\nanimal, which reminded them of the bears; but Dorothy reassured them by\r\nexplaining that Eureka was a pet and could do no harm even if she wished\r\nto. Then, as the others had by this time moved away from the table, the\r\nkitten sprang upon the chair and put her paws upon the cloth to see what\r\nthere was to eat. To her surprise an unseen hand clutched her and held\r\nher suspended in the air. Eureka was frantic with terror, and tried to\r\nscratch and bite, so the next moment she was dropped to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see that, Dorothy?\" she gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear,\" her mistress replied; \"there are people living in this\r\nhouse, although we cannot see them. And you must have better manners,\r\nEureka, or something worse will happen to you.\"\r\n\r\nShe placed a plate of food upon the floor and the kitten ate greedily.\r\n\r\n\"Give me that nice-smelling fruit I saw on the table,\" she begged, when\r\nshe had cleaned the plate.\r\n\r\n\"Those are damas,\" said Dorothy, \"and you must never even taste them,\r\nEureka, or you'll get invis'ble, and then we can't see you at all.\"\r\n\r\nThe kitten gazed wistfully at the forbidden fruit.\r\n\r\n\"Does it hurt to be invis'ble?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" Dorothy answered; \"but it would hurt me dre'fully to\r\nlose you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I won't touch it,\" decided the kitten; \"but you must keep it\r\naway from me, for the smell is very tempting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell us, sir or ma'am,\" said the Wizard, addressing the air\r\nbecause he did not quite know where the unseen people stood, \"if there\r\nis any way we can get out of your beautiful Valley, and on top of the\r\nEarth again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, one can leave the Valley easily enough,\" answered the man's voice;\r\n\"but to do so you must enter a far less pleasant country. As for\r\nreaching the top of the earth, I have never heard that it is possible to\r\ndo that, and if you succeeded in getting there you would probably fall\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" said Dorothy, \"we've been there, and we know.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Valley of Voe is certainly a charming place,\" resumed the Wizard;\r\n\"but we cannot be contented in any other land than our own, for long.\r\nEven if we should come to unpleasant places on our way it is necessary,\r\nin order to reach the earth's surface, to keep moving on toward it.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said the man, \"it will be best for you to cross our\r\nValley and mount the spiral staircase inside the Pyramid Mountain. The\r\ntop of that mountain is lost in the clouds, and when you reach it you\r\nwill be in the awful Land of Naught, where the Gargoyles live.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are Gargoyles?\" asked Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, young sir. Our greatest Champion, Overman-Anu, once\r\nclimbed the spiral stairway and fought nine days with the Gargoyles\r\nbefore he could escape them and come back; but he could never be induced\r\nto describe the dreadful creatures, and soon afterward a bear caught\r\nhim and ate him up.\"\r\n\r\nThe wanderers were rather discouraged by this gloomy report, but Dorothy\r\nsaid with a sigh:\r\n\r\n\"If the only way to get home is to meet the Gurgles, then we've got to\r\nmeet 'em. They can't be worse than the Wicked Witch or the Nome King.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must remember you had the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman to help\r\nyou conquer those enemies,\" suggested the Wizard. \"Just now, my dear,\r\nthere is not a single warrior in your company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I guess Zeb could fight if he had to. Couldn't you, Zeb?\" asked the\r\nlittle girl.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps; if I had to,\" answered Zeb, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"And you have the jointed sword that you chopped the veg'table Sorcerer\r\nin two with,\" the girl said to the little man.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" he replied; \"and in my satchel are other useful things to fight\r\nwith.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the Gargoyles most dread is a noise,\" said the man's voice. \"Our\r\nChampion told me that when he shouted his battle-cry the creatures\r\nshuddered and drew back, hesitating to continue the combat. But they\r\nwere in great numbers, and the Champion could not shout much because he\r\nhad to save his breath for fighting.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said the Wizard; \"we can all yell better than we can fight,\r\nso we ought to defeat the Gargoyles.\"\r\n\r\n\"But tell me,\" said Dorothy, \"how did such a brave Champion happen to\r\nlet the bears eat him? And if he was invis'ble, and the bears invis'ble,\r\nwho knows that they really ate him up?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Champion had killed eleven bears in his time,\" returned the unseen\r\nman; \"and we know this is true because when any creature is dead the\r\ninvisible charm of the dama-fruit ceases to be active, and the slain one\r\ncan be plainly seen by all eyes. When the Champion killed a bear\r\neveryone could see it; and when the bears killed the Champion we all saw\r\nseveral pieces of him scattered about, which of course disappeared again\r\nwhen the bears devoured them.\"\r\n\r\nThey now bade farewell to the kind but unseen people of the cottage, and\r\nafter the man had called their attention to a high, pyramid-shaped\r\nmountain on the opposite side of the Valley, and told them how to travel\r\nin order to reach it, they again started upon their journey.\r\n\r\nThey followed the course of a broad stream and passed several more\r\npretty cottages; but of course they saw no one, nor did any one speak to\r\nthem. Fruits and flowers grew plentifully all about, and there were many\r\nof the delicious damas that the people of Voe were so fond of.\r\n\r\nAbout noon they stopped to allow Jim to rest in the shade of a pretty\r\norchard, and while they plucked and ate some of the cherries and plums\r\nthat grew there a soft voice suddenly said to them:\r\n\r\n\"There are bears near by. Be careful.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wizard got out his sword at once, and Zeb grabbed the horse-whip.\r\nDorothy climbed into the buggy, although Jim had been unharnessed from\r\nit and was grazing some distance away.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the unseen voice laughed lightly and said:\r\n\r\n\"You cannot escape the bears that way.\"\r\n\r\n\"How _can_ we 'scape?\" asked Dorothy, nervously, for an unseen danger is\r\nalways the hardest to face.\r\n\r\n\"You must take to the river,\" was the reply. \"The bears will not venture\r\nupon the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we would be drowned!\" exclaimed the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, there is no need of that,\" said the voice, which from its gentle\r\ntones seemed to belong to a young girl. \"You are strangers in the Valley\r\nof Voe, and do not seem to know our ways; so I will try to save you.\"\r\n\r\nThe next moment a broad-leaved plant was jerked from the ground where it\r\ngrew and held suspended in the air before the Wizard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ESCAPING THE INVISIBLE BEARS.]\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said the voice, \"you must rub these leaves upon the soles of\r\nall your feet, and then you will be able to walk upon the water without\r\nsinking below the surface. It is a secret the bears do not know, and we\r\npeople of Voe usually walk upon the water when we travel, and so escape\r\nour enemies.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you!\" cried the Wizard, joyfully, and at once rubbed a leaf upon\r\nthe soles of Dorothy's shoes and then upon his own. The girl took a leaf\r\nand rubbed it upon the kitten's paws, and the rest of the plant was\r\nhanded to Zeb, who, after applying it to his own feet, carefully rubbed\r\nit upon all four of Jim's hoofs and then upon the tires of the\r\nbuggy-wheels. He had nearly finished this last task when a low growling\r\nwas suddenly heard and the horse began to jump around and kick viciously\r\nwith his heels.\r\n\r\n\"Quick! To the water, or you are lost!\" cried their unseen friend, and\r\nwithout hesitation the Wizard drew the buggy down the bank and out upon\r\nthe broad river, for Dorothy was still seated in it with Eureka in her\r\narms. They did not sink at all, owing to the virtues of the strange\r\nplant they had used, and when the buggy was in the middle of the stream\r\nthe Wizard returned to the bank to assist Zeb and Jim.\r\n\r\nThe horse was plunging madly about, and two or three deep gashes\r\nappeared upon its flanks, from which the blood flowed freely.\r\n\r\n\"Run for the river!\" shouted the Wizard, and Jim quickly freed himself\r\nfrom his unseen tormenters by a few vicious kicks and then obeyed. As\r\nsoon as he trotted out upon the surface of the river he found himself\r\nsafe from pursuit, and Zeb was already running across the water toward\r\nDorothy.\r\n\r\nAs the little Wizard turned to follow them he felt a hot breath against\r\nhis cheek and heard a low, fierce growl. At once he began stabbing at\r\nthe air with his sword, and he knew that he had struck some substance\r\nbecause when he drew back the blade it was dripping with blood. The\r\nthird time that he thrust out the weapon there was a loud roar and a\r\nfall, and suddenly at his feet appeared the form of a great red bear,\r\nwhich was nearly as big as the horse and much stronger and fiercer. The\r\nbeast was quite dead from the sword thrusts, and after a glance at its\r\nterrible claws and sharp teeth the little man turned in a panic and\r\nrushed out upon the water, for other menacing growls told him more bears\r\nwere near.\r\n\r\nOn the river, however, the adventurers seemed to be perfectly safe.\r\nDorothy and the buggy had floated slowly down stream with the current of\r\nthe water, and the others made haste to join her. The Wizard opened his\r\nsatchel and got out some sticking-plaster with which he mended the cuts\r\nJim had received from the claws of the bears.\r\n\r\n\"I think we'd better stick to the river, after this,\" said Dorothy. \"If\r\nour unknown friend hadn't warned us, and told us what to do, we would\r\nall be dead by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" agreed the Wizard, \"and as the river seems to be flowing\r\nin the direction of the Pyramid Mountain it will be the easiest way for\r\nus to travel.\"\r\n\r\nZeb hitched Jim to the buggy again, and the horse trotted along and drew\r\nthem rapidly over the smooth water. The kitten was at first dreadfully\r\nafraid of getting wet, but Dorothy let her down and soon Eureka was\r\nfrisking along beside the buggy without being scared a bit. Once a\r\nlittle fish swam too near the surface, and the kitten grabbed it in her\r\nmouth and ate it up as quick as a wink; but Dorothy cautioned her to be\r\ncareful what she ate in this valley of enchantments, and no more fishes\r\nwere careless enough to swim within reach.\r\n\r\nAfter a journey of several hours they came to a point where the river\r\ncurved, and they found they must cross a mile or so of the Valley before\r\nthey came to the Pyramid Mountain. There were few houses in this part,\r\nand few orchards or flowers; so our friends feared they might encounter\r\nmore of the savage bears, which they had learned to dread with all their\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to make a dash, Jim,\" said the Wizard, \"and run as fast as\r\nyou can go.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered the horse; \"I'll do my best. But you must remember\r\nI'm old, and my dashing days are past and gone.\"\r\n\r\nAll three got into the buggy and Zeb picked up the reins, though Jim\r\nneeded no guidance of any sort. The horse was still smarting from the\r\nsharp claws of the invisible bears, and as soon as he was on land and\r\nheaded toward the mountain the thought that more of those fearsome\r\ncreatures might be near acted as a spur and sent him galloping along in\r\na way that made Dorothy catch her breath.\r\n\r\nThen Zeb, in a spirit of mischief, uttered a growl like that of the\r\nbears, and Jim pricked up his ears and fairly flew. His boney legs moved\r\nso fast they could scarcely be seen, and the Wizard clung fast to the\r\nseat and yelled \"Whoa!\" at the top of his voice.\r\n\r\n\"I--I'm 'fraid he's--he's running away!\" gasped Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"I _know_ he is,\" said Zeb; \"but no bear can catch him if he keeps up\r\nthat gait--and the harness or the buggy don't break.\"\r\n\r\nJim did not make a mile a minute; but almost before they were aware of\r\nit he drew up at the foot of the mountain, so suddenly that the Wizard\r\nand Zeb both sailed over the dashboard and landed in the soft\r\ngrass--where they rolled over several times before they stopped.\r\nDorothy nearly went with them, but she was holding fast to the iron rail\r\nof the seat, and that saved her. She squeezed the kitten, though, until\r\nit screeched; and then the old cab-horse made several curious sounds\r\nthat led the little girl to suspect he was laughing at them all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10.\r\n\r\nTHE BRAIDED MAN OF PYRAMID MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mountain before them was shaped like a cone and was so tall that its\r\npoint was lost in the clouds. Directly facing the place where Jim had\r\nstopped was an arched opening leading to a broad stairway. The stairs\r\nwere cut in the rock inside the mountain, and they were broad and not\r\nvery steep, because they circled around like a cork-screw, and at the\r\narched opening where the flight began the circle was quite big. At the\r\nfoot of the stairs was a sign reading:\r\n\r\n        WARNING.\r\n  These steps lead to the\r\n        Land of the Gargoyles.\r\n    DANGER! KEEP OUT.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how Jim is ever going to draw the buggy up so many stairs,\"\r\nsaid Dorothy, gravely.\r\n\r\n\"No trouble at all,\" declared the horse, with a contemptuous neigh.\r\n\"Still, I don't care to drag any passengers. You'll all have to walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose the stairs get steeper?\" suggested Zeb, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Then you'll have to boost the buggy-wheels, that's all,\" answered Jim.\r\n\r\n\"We'll try it, anyway,\" said the Wizard. \"It's the only way to get out\r\nof the Valley of Voe.\"\r\n\r\nSo they began to ascend the stairs, Dorothy and the Wizard first, Jim\r\nnext, drawing the buggy, and then Zeb to watch that nothing happened to\r\nthe harness.\r\n\r\nThe light was dim, and soon they mounted into total darkness, so that\r\nthe Wizard was obliged to get out his lanterns to light the way. But\r\nthis enabled them to proceed steadily until they came to a landing where\r\nthere was a rift in the side of the mountain that let in both light and\r\nair. Looking through this opening they could see the Valley of Voe lying\r\nfar below them, the cottages seeming like toy houses from that distance.\r\n\r\nAfter resting a few moments they resumed their climb, and still the\r\nstairs were broad and low enough for Jim to draw the buggy easily after\r\nhim. The old horse panted a little, and had to stop often to get his\r\nbreath. At such times they were all glad to wait for him, for\r\ncontinually climbing up stairs is sure to make one's legs ache.\r\n\r\nThey wound about, always going upward, for some time. The lights from\r\nthe lanterns dimly showed the way, but it was a gloomy journey, and they\r\nwere pleased when a broad streak of light ahead assured them they were\r\ncoming to a second landing.\r\n\r\nHere one side of the mountain had a great hole in it, like the mouth of\r\na cavern, and the stairs stopped at the near edge of the floor and\r\ncommenced ascending again at the opposite edge.\r\n\r\nThe opening in the mountain was on the side opposite to the Valley of\r\nVoe, and our travellers looked out upon a strange scene. Below them was\r\na vast space, at the bottom of which was a black sea with rolling\r\nbillows, through which little tongues of flame constantly shot up. Just\r\nabove them, and almost on a level with their platform, were banks of\r\nrolling clouds which constantly shifted position and changed color. The\r\nblues and greys were very beautiful, and Dorothy noticed that on the\r\ncloud banks sat or reclined fleecy, shadowy forms of beautiful beings\r\nwho must have been the Cloud Fairies. Mortals who stand upon the earth\r\nand look up at the sky cannot often distinguish these forms, but our\r\nfriends were now so near to the clouds that they observed the dainty\r\nfairies very clearly.\r\n\r\n\"Are they real?\" asked Zeb, in an awed voice.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" replied Dorothy, softly. \"They are the Cloud Fairies.\"\r\n\r\n\"They seem like open-work,\" remarked the boy, gazing intently. \"If I\r\nshould squeeze one, there wouldn't be anything left of it.\"\r\n\r\nIn the open space between the clouds and the black, bubbling sea far\r\nbeneath, could be seen an occasional strange bird winging its way\r\nswiftly through the air. These birds were of enormous size, and reminded\r\nZeb of the rocs he had read about in the Arabian Nights. They had fierce\r\neyes and sharp talons and beaks, and the children hoped none of them\r\nwould venture into the cavern.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I declare!\" suddenly exclaimed the little Wizard. \"What in the\r\nworld is this?\"\r\n\r\nThey turned around and found a man standing on the floor in the center\r\nof the cave, who bowed very politely when he saw he had attracted their\r\nattention. He was a very old man, bent nearly double; but the queerest\r\nthing about him was his white hair and beard. These were so long that\r\nthey reached to his feet, and both the hair and the beard were\r\ncarefully plaited into many braids, and the end of each braid fastened\r\nwith a bow of colored ribbon.\r\n\r\n\"Where did you come from?\" asked Dorothy, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"No place at all,\" answered the man with the braids; \"that is, not\r\nrecently. Once I lived on top the earth, but for many years I have had\r\nmy factory in this spot--half way up Pyramid Mountain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we only half way up?\" enquired the boy, in a discouraged tone.\r\n\r\n\"I believe so, my lad,\" replied the braided man. \"But as I have never\r\nbeen in either direction, down or up, since I arrived, I cannot be\r\npositive whether it is exactly half way or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you a factory in this place?\" asked the Wizard, who had been\r\nexamining the strange personage carefully.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" said the other. \"I am a great inventor, you must know, and\r\nI manufacture my products in this lonely spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are your products?\" enquired the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I make Assorted Flutters for flags and bunting, and a superior\r\ngrade of Rustles for ladies' silk gowns.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" said the Wizard, with a sigh. \"May we examine some of\r\nthese articles?\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLOUD FAIRIES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRAIDED MAN.]\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed; come into my shop, please,\" and the braided man turned and\r\nled the way into a smaller cave, where he evidently lived. Here, on a\r\nbroad shelf, were several card-board boxes of various sizes, each tied\r\nwith cotton cord.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said the man, taking up a box and handling it gently, \"contains\r\ntwelve dozen rustles--enough to last any lady a year. Will you buy it,\r\nmy dear?\" he asked, addressing Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"My gown isn't silk,\" she said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind. When you open the box the rustles will escape, whether you\r\nare wearing a silk dress or not,\" said the man, seriously. Then he\r\npicked up another box. \"In this,\" he continued, \"are many assorted\r\nflutters. They are invaluable to make flags flutter on a still day, when\r\nthere is no wind. You, sir,\" turning to the Wizard, \"ought to have this\r\nassortment. Once you have tried my goods I am sure you will never be\r\nwithout them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no money with me,\" said the Wizard, evasively.\r\n\r\n\"I do not want money,\" returned the braided man, \"for I could not spend\r\nit in this deserted place if I had it. But I would like very much a blue\r\nhair-ribbon. You will notice my braids are tied with yellow, pink,\r\nbrown, red, green, white and black; but I have no blue ribbons.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get you one!\" cried Dorothy, who was sorry for the poor man; so\r\nshe ran back to the buggy and took from her suit-case a pretty blue\r\nribbon. It did her good to see how the braided man's eyes sparkled when\r\nhe received this treasure.\r\n\r\n\"You have made me very, very happy, my dear!\" he exclaimed; and then he\r\ninsisted on the Wizard taking the box of flutters and the little girl\r\naccepting the box of rustles.\r\n\r\n\"You may need them, some time,\" he said, \"and there is really no use in\r\nmy manufacturing these things unless somebody uses them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you leave the surface of the earth?\" enquired the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"I could not help it. It is a sad story, but if you will try to restrain\r\nyour tears I will tell you about it. On earth I was a manufacturer of\r\nImported Holes for American Swiss Cheese, and I will acknowledge that I\r\nsupplied a superior article, which was in great demand. Also I made\r\npores for porous plasters and high-grade holes for doughnuts and\r\nbuttons. Finally I invented a new Adjustable Post-hole, which I thought\r\nwould make my fortune. I manufactured a large quantity of these\r\npost-holes, and having no room in which to store them I set them all end\r\nto end and put the top one in the ground. That made an extraordinary\r\nlong hole, as you may imagine, and reached far down into the earth; and,\r\nas I leaned over it to try to see to the bottom, I lost my balance and\r\ntumbled in. Unfortunately, the hole led directly into the vast space you\r\nsee outside this mountain; but I managed to catch a point of rock that\r\nprojected from this cavern, and so saved myself from tumbling headlong\r\ninto the black waves beneath, where the tongues of flame that dart out\r\nwould certainly have consumed me. Here, then, I made my home; and\r\nalthough it is a lonely place I amuse myself making rustles and\r\nflutters, and so get along very nicely.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the braided man had completed this strange tale Dorothy nearly\r\nlaughed, because it was all so absurd; but the Wizard tapped his\r\nforehead significantly, to indicate that he thought the poor man was\r\ncrazy. So they politely bade him good day, and went back to the outer\r\ncavern to resume their journey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11.\r\n\r\nTHEY MEET THE WOODEN GARGOYLES\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother breathless climb brought our adventurers to a third landing\r\nwhere there was a rift in the mountain. On peering out all they could\r\nsee was rolling banks of clouds, so thick that they obscured all else.\r\n\r\nBut the travellers were obliged to rest, and while they were sitting on\r\nthe rocky floor the Wizard felt in his pocket and brought out the nine\r\ntiny piglets. To his delight they were now plainly visible, which proved\r\nthat they had passed beyond the influence of the magical Valley of Voe.\r\n\r\n\"Why, we can see each other again!\" cried one, joyfully.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" sighed Eureka; \"and I also can see you again, and the sight\r\nmakes me dreadfully hungry. Please, Mr. Wizard, may I eat just one of\r\nthe fat little piglets? You'd never miss _one_ of them, I'm sure!\"\r\n\r\n\"What a horrid, savage beast!\" exclaimed a piglet; \"and after we've been\r\nsuch good friends, too, and played with one another!\"\r\n\r\n\"When I'm not hungry, I love to play with you all,\" said the kitten,\r\ndemurely; \"but when my stomach is empty it seems that nothing would fill\r\nit so nicely as a fat piglet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we trusted you so!\" said another of the nine, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n\"And thought you were respectable!\" said another.\r\n\r\n\"It seems we were mistaken,\" declared a third, looking at the kitten\r\ntimorously, \"no one with such murderous desires should belong to our\r\nparty, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, Eureka,\" remarked Dorothy, reprovingly, \"you are making\r\nyourself disliked. There are certain things proper for a kitten to eat;\r\nbut I never heard of a kitten eating a pig, under _any_ cir'stances.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see such little pigs before?\" asked the kitten. \"They are\r\nno bigger than mice, and I'm sure mice are proper for me to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't the bigness, dear; its the variety,\" replied the girl. \"These\r\nare Mr. Wizard's pets, just as you are my pet, and it wouldn't be any\r\nmore proper for you to eat them than it would be for Jim to eat you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's just what I shall do if you don't let those little balls of\r\npork alone,\" said Jim, glaring at the kitten with his round, big eyes.\r\n\"If you injure any one of them I'll chew you up instantly.\"\r\n\r\nThe kitten looked at the horse thoughtfully, as if trying to decide\r\nwhether he meant it or not.\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" she said, \"I'll leave them alone. You haven't many teeth\r\nleft, Jim, but the few you have are sharp enough to make me shudder. So\r\nthe piglets will be perfectly safe, hereafter, as far as I am\r\nconcerned.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is right, Eureka,\" remarked the Wizard, earnestly. \"Let us all be\r\na happy family and love one another.\"\r\n\r\nEureka yawned and stretched herself.\r\n\r\n\"I've always loved the piglets,\" she said; \"but they don't love me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one can love a person he's afraid of,\" asserted Dorothy. \"If you\r\nbehave, and don't scare the little pigs, I'm sure they'll grow very fond\r\nof you.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wizard now put the nine tiny ones back into his pocket and the\r\njourney was resumed.\r\n\r\n\"We must be pretty near the top, now,\" said the boy, as they climbed\r\nwearily up the dark, winding stairway.\r\n\r\n\"The Country of the Gurgles can't be far from the top of the earth,\"\r\nremarked Dorothy. \"It isn't very nice down here. I'd like to get home\r\nagain, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\nNo one replied to this, because they found they needed all their breath\r\nfor the climb. The stairs had become narrower and Zeb and the Wizard\r\noften had to help Jim pull the buggy from one step to another, or keep\r\nit from jamming against the rocky walls.\r\n\r\nAt last, however, a dim light appeared ahead of them, which grew clearer\r\nand stronger as they advanced.\r\n\r\n\"Thank goodness we're nearly there!\" panted the little Wizard.\r\n\r\nJim, who was in advance, saw the last stair before him and stuck his\r\nhead above the rocky sides of the stairway. Then he halted, ducked down\r\nand began to back up, so that he nearly fell with the buggy onto the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go down again!\" he said, in his hoarse voice.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" snapped the tired Wizard. \"What's the matter with you, old\r\nman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything,\" grumbled the horse. \"I've taken a look at this place, and\r\nit's no fit country for real creatures to go to. Everything's dead, up\r\nthere--no flesh or blood or growing thing anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind; we can't turn back,\" said Dorothy; \"and we don't intend to\r\nstay there, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's dangerous,\" growled Jim, in a stubborn tone.\r\n\r\n\"See here, my good steed,\" broke in the Wizard, \"little Dorothy and I\r\nhave been in many queer countries in our travels, and always escaped\r\nwithout harm. We've even been to the marvelous Land of Oz--haven't we,\r\nDorothy?--so we don't much care what the Country of the Gargoyles is\r\nlike. Go ahead, Jim, and whatever happens we'll make the best of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" answered the horse; \"this is your excursion, and not mine;\r\nso if you get into trouble don't blame me.\"\r\n\r\nWith this speech he bent forward and dragged the buggy up the remaining\r\nsteps. The others followed and soon they were all standing upon a broad\r\nplatform and gazing at the most curious and startling sight their eyes\r\nhad ever beheld.\r\n\r\n\"The Country of the Gargoyles is all wooden!\" exclaimed Zeb; and so it\r\nwas. The ground was sawdust and the pebbles scattered around were hard\r\nknots from trees, worn smooth in course of time. There were odd wooden\r\nhouses, with carved wooden flowers in the front yards. The tree-trunks\r\nwere of coarse wood, but the leaves of the trees were shavings. The\r\npatches of grass were splinters of wood, and where neither grass nor\r\nsawdust showed was a solid wooden flooring. Wooden birds fluttered\r\namong the trees and wooden cows were browsing upon the wooden grass; but\r\nthe most amazing things of all were the wooden people--the creatures\r\nknown as Gargoyles.\r\n\r\nThese were very numerous, for the palace was thickly inhabited, and a\r\nlarge group of the queer people clustered near, gazing sharply upon the\r\nstrangers who had emerged from the long spiral stairway.\r\n\r\nThe Gargoyles were very small of stature, being less than three feet in\r\nheight. Their bodies were round, their legs short and thick and their\r\narms extraordinarily long and stout. Their heads were too big for their\r\nbodies and their faces were decidedly ugly to look upon. Some had long,\r\ncurved noses and chins, small eyes and wide, grinning mouths. Others had\r\nflat noses, protruding eyes, and ears that were shaped like those of an\r\nelephant. There were many types, indeed, scarcely two being alike; but\r\nall were equally disagreeable in appearance. The tops of their heads had\r\nno hair, but were carved into a variety of fantastic shapes, some having\r\na row of points or balls around the top, other designs resembling\r\nflowers or vegetables, and still others having squares that looked like\r\nwaffles cut criss-cross on their heads. They all wore short wooden wings\r\nwhich were fastened to their wooden bodies by means of wooden hinges\r\nwith wooden screws, and with these wings they flew swiftly and\r\nnoiselessly here and there, their legs being of little use to them.\r\n\r\nThis noiseless motion was one of the most peculiar things about the\r\nGargoyles. They made no sounds at all, either in flying or trying to\r\nspeak, and they conversed mainly by means of quick signals made with\r\ntheir wooden fingers or lips. Neither was there any sound to be heard\r\nanywhere throughout the wooden country. The birds did not sing, nor did\r\nthe cows moo; yet there was more than ordinary activity everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe group of these queer creatures which was discovered clustered near\r\nthe stairs at first remained staring and motionless, glaring with evil\r\neyes at the intruders who had so suddenly appeared in their land. In\r\nturn the Wizard and the children, the horse and the kitten, examined the\r\nGargoyles with the same silent attention.\r\n\r\n\"There's going to be trouble, I'm sure,\" remarked the horse. \"Unhitch\r\nthose tugs, Zeb, and set me free from the buggy, so I can fight\r\ncomfortably.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jim's right,\" sighed the Wizard. \"There's going to be trouble, and my\r\nsword isn't stout enough to cut up those wooden bodies--so I shall have\r\nto get out my revolvers.\"\r\n\r\nHe got his satchel from the buggy and, opening it, took out two deadly\r\nlooking revolvers that made the children shrink back in alarm just to\r\nlook at.\r\n\r\n\"What harm can the Gurgles do?\" asked Dorothy. \"They have no weapons to\r\nhurt us with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Each of their arms is a wooden club,\" answered the little man, \"and I'm\r\nsure the creatures mean mischief, by the looks of their eyes. Even these\r\nrevolvers can merely succeed in damaging a few of their wooden bodies,\r\nand after that we will be at their mercy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why fight at all, in that case?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"So I may die with a clear conscience,\" returned the Wizard, gravely.\r\n\"It's every man's duty to do the best he knows how; and I'm going to do\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wish I had an axe,\" said Zeb, who by now had unhitched the horse.\r\n\r\n\"If we had known we were coming we might have brought along several\r\nother useful things,\" responded the Wizard. \"But we dropped into this\r\nadventure rather unexpectedly.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gargoyles had backed away a distance when they heard the sound of\r\ntalking, for although our friends had spoken in low tones their words\r\nseemed loud in the silence surrounding them. But as soon as the\r\nconversation ceased the grinning, ugly creatures arose in a flock and\r\nflew swiftly toward the strangers, their long arms stretched out before\r\nthem like the bowsprits of a fleet of sail-boats. The horse had\r\nespecially attracted their notice, because it was the biggest and\r\nstrangest creature they had ever seen; so it became the center of their\r\nfirst attack.\r\n\r\nBut Jim was ready for them, and when he saw them coming he turned his\r\nheels toward them and began kicking out as hard as he could. Crack!\r\ncrash! bang! went his iron-shod hoofs against the wooden bodies of the\r\nGargoyles, and they were battered right and left with such force that\r\nthey scattered like straws in the wind. But the noise and clatter seemed\r\nas dreadful to them as Jim's heels, for all who were able swiftly turned\r\nand flew away to a great distance. The others picked themselves up from\r\nthe ground one by one and quickly rejoined their fellows, so for a\r\nmoment the horse thought he had won the fight with ease.\r\n\r\nBut the Wizard was not so confident.\r\n\r\n\"Those wooden things are impossible to hurt,\" he said, \"and all the\r\ndamage Jim has done to them is to knock a few splinters from their noses\r\nand ears. That cannot make them look any uglier, I'm sure, and it is my\r\nopinion they will soon renew the attack.\"\r\n\r\n\"What made them fly away?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"The noise, of course. Don't you remember how the Champion escaped them\r\nby shouting his battle-cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we escape down the stairs, too,\" suggested the boy. \"We have\r\ntime, just now, and I'd rather face the invis'ble bears than those\r\nwooden imps.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" returned Dorothy, stoutly, \"it won't do to go back, for then we\r\nwould never get home. Let's fight it out.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is what I advise,\" said the Wizard. \"They haven't defeated us yet,\r\nand Jim is worth a whole army.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Gargoyles were clever enough not to attack the horse the next\r\ntime. They advanced in a great swarm, having been joined by many more of\r\ntheir kind, and they flew straight over Jim's head to where the others\r\nwere standing.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard raised one of his revolvers and fired into the throng of his\r\nenemies, and the shot resounded like a clap of thunder in that silent\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nSome of the wooden beings fell flat upon the ground, where they quivered\r\nand trembled in every limb; but most of them managed to wheel and escape\r\nagain to a distance.\r\n\r\nZeb ran and picked up one of the Gargoyles that lay nearest to him. The\r\ntop of its head was carved into a crown and the Wizard's bullet had\r\nstruck it exactly in the left eye, which was a hard wooden knot. Half of\r\nthe bullet stuck in the wood and half stuck out, so it had been the jar\r\nand the sudden noise that had knocked the creature down, more than the\r\nfact that it was really hurt. Before this crowned Gargoyle had recovered\r\nhimself Zeb had wound a strap several times around its body, confining\r\nits wings and arms so that it could not move. Then, having tied the\r\nwooden creature securely, the boy buckled the strap and tossed his\r\nprisoner into the buggy. By that time the others had all retired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12.\r\n\r\nA WONDERFUL ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a while the enemy hesitated to renew the attack. Then a few of them\r\nadvanced until another shot from the Wizard's revolver made them\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n\"That's fine,\" said Zeb. \"We've got 'em on the run now, sure enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"But only for a time,\" replied the Wizard, shaking his head gloomily.\r\n\"These revolvers are good for six shots each, but when those are gone we\r\nshall be helpless.\"\r\n\r\nThe Gargoyles seemed to realize this, for they sent a few of their band\r\ntime after time to attack the strangers and draw the fire from the\r\nlittle man's revolvers. In this way none of them was shocked by the\r\ndreadful report more than once, for the main band kept far away and\r\neach time a new company was sent into the battle. When the Wizard had\r\nfired all of his twelve bullets he had caused no damage to the enemy\r\nexcept to stun a few by the noise, and so he was no nearer to victory\r\nthan in the beginning of the fray.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WIZARD FIRED INTO THE THRONG.]\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do now?\" asked Dorothy, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Let's yell--all together,\" said Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"And fight at the same time,\" added the Wizard. \"We will get near Jim,\r\nso that he can help us, and each one must take some weapon and do the\r\nbest he can. I'll use my sword, although it isn't much account in this\r\naffair. Dorothy must take her parasol and open it suddenly when the\r\nwooden folks attack her. I haven't anything for you, Zeb.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll use the king,\" said the boy, and pulled his prisoner out of the\r\nbuggy. The bound Gargoyle's arms extended far out beyond its head, so by\r\ngrasping its wrists Zeb found the king made a very good club. The boy\r\nwas strong for one of his years, having always worked upon a farm; so he\r\nwas likely to prove more dangerous to the enemy than the Wizard.\r\n\r\nWhen the next company of Gargoyles advanced, our adventurers began\r\nyelling as if they had gone mad. Even the kitten gave a dreadfully\r\nshrill scream and at the same time Jim the cab-horse neighed loudly.\r\nThis daunted the enemy for a time, but the defenders were soon out of\r\nbreath. Perceiving this, as well as the fact that there were no more of\r\nthe awful \"bangs\" to come from the revolvers, the Gargoyles advanced in\r\na swarm as thick as bees, so that the air was filled with them.\r\n\r\nDorothy squatted upon the ground and put up her parasol, which nearly\r\ncovered her and proved a great protection. The Wizard's sword-blade\r\nsnapped into a dozen pieces at the first blow he struck against the\r\nwooden people. Zeb pounded away with the Gargoyle he was using as a club\r\nuntil he had knocked down dozens of foes; but at the last they clustered\r\nso thickly about him that he no longer had room in which to swing his\r\narms. The horse performed some wonderful kicking and even Eureka\r\nassisted when she leaped bodily upon the Gargoyles and scratched and bit\r\nat them like a wild-cat.\r\n\r\nBut all this bravery amounted to nothing at all. The wooden things wound\r\ntheir long arms around Zeb and the Wizard and held them fast. Dorothy\r\nwas captured in the same way, and numbers of the Gargoyles clung to\r\nJim's legs, so weighting him down that the poor beast was helpless.\r\nEureka made a desperate dash to escape and scampered along the ground\r\nlike a streak; but a grinning Gargoyle flew after her and grabbed her\r\nbefore she had gone very far.\r\n\r\nAll of them expected nothing less than instant death; but to their\r\nsurprise the wooden creatures flew into the air with them and bore them\r\nfar away, over miles and miles of wooden country, until they came to a\r\nwooden city. The houses of this city had many corners, being square and\r\nsix-sided and eight-sided. They were tower-like in shape and the best of\r\nthem seemed old and weather-worn; yet all were strong and substantial.\r\n\r\nTo one of these houses which had neither doors nor windows, but only one\r\nbroad opening far up underneath the roof, the prisoners were brought by\r\ntheir captors. The Gargoyles roughly pushed them into the opening, where\r\nthere was a platform, and then flew away and left them. As they had no\r\nwings the strangers could not fly away, and if they jumped down from\r\nsuch a height they would surely be killed. The creatures had sense\r\nenough to reason that way, and the only mistake they made was in\r\nsupposing the earth people were unable to overcome such ordinary\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nJim was brought with the others, although it took a good many Gargoyles\r\nto carry the big beast through the air and land him on the high\r\nplatform, and the buggy was thrust in after him because it belonged to\r\nthe party and the wooden folks had no idea what it was used for or\r\nwhether it was alive or not. When Eureka's captor had thrown the kitten\r\nafter the others the last Gargoyle silently disappeared, leaving our\r\nfriends to breathe freely once more.\r\n\r\n\"What an awful fight!\" said Dorothy, catching her breath in little\r\ngasps.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know,\" purred Eureka, smoothing her ruffled fur with her\r\npaw; \"we didn't manage to hurt anybody, and nobody managed to hurt us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank goodness we are together again, even if we are prisoners,\" sighed\r\nthe little girl.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder why they didn't kill us on the spot,\" remarked Zeb, who had\r\nlost his king in the struggle.\r\n\r\n\"They are probably keeping us for some ceremony,\" the Wizard answered,\r\nreflectively; \"but there is no doubt they intend to kill us as dead as\r\npossible in a short time.\"\r\n\r\n\"As dead as poss'ble would be pretty dead, wouldn't it?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my dear. But we have no need to worry about that just now. Let us\r\nexamine our prison and see what it is like.\"\r\n\r\nThe space underneath the roof, where they stood, permitted them to see\r\non all sides of the tall building, and they looked with much curiosity\r\nat the city spread out beneath them. Everything visible was made of\r\nwood, and the scene seemed stiff and extremely unnatural.\r\n\r\nFrom their platform a stair descended into the house, and the children\r\nand the Wizard explored it after lighting a lantern to show them the\r\nway. Several stories of empty rooms rewarded their search, but nothing\r\nmore; so after a time they came back to the platform again. Had there\r\nbeen any doors or windows in the lower rooms, or had not the boards of\r\nthe house been so thick and stout, escape would have been easy; but to\r\nremain down below was like being in a cellar or the hold of a ship, and\r\nthey did not like the darkness or the damp smell.\r\n\r\nIn this country, as in all others they had visited underneath the\r\nearth's surface, there was no night, a constant and strong light coming\r\nfrom some unknown source. Looking out, they could see into some of the\r\nhouses near them, where there were open windows in abundance, and were\r\nable to mark the forms of the wooden Gargoyles moving about in their\r\ndwellings.\r\n\r\n\"This seems to be their time of rest,\" observed the Wizard. \"All people\r\nneed rest, even if they are made of wood, and as there is no night here\r\nthey select a certain time of the day in which to sleep or doze.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel sleepy myself,\" remarked Zeb, yawning.\r\n\r\n\"Why, where's Eureka?\" cried Dorothy, suddenly.\r\n\r\nThey all looked around, but the kitten was no place to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"She's gone out for a walk,\" said Jim, gruffly.\r\n\r\n\"Where? On the roof?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"No; she just dug her claws into the wood and climbed down the sides of\r\nthis house to the ground.\"\r\n\r\n\"She couldn't climb _down_, Jim,\" said Dorothy. \"To climb means to go\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who said so?\" demanded the horse.\r\n\r\n\"My school-teacher said so; and she knows a lot, Jim.\"\r\n\r\n\"To 'climb down' is sometimes used as a figure of speech,\" remarked the\r\nWizard.\r\n\r\n\"Well, this was a figure of a cat,\" said Jim, \"and she _went_ down,\r\nanyhow, whether she climbed or crept.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! how careless Eureka is,\" exclaimed the girl, much distressed.\r\n\"The Gurgles will get her, sure!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha!\" chuckled the old cab-horse; \"they're not 'Gurgles,' little\r\nmaid; they're Gargoyles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind; they'll get Eureka, whatever they're called.\"\r\n\r\n\"No they won't,\" said the voice of the kitten, and Eureka herself\r\ncrawled over the edge of the platform and sat down quietly upon the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\"Wherever have you been, Eureka?\" asked Dorothy, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"Watching the wooden folks. They're too funny for anything, Dorothy.\r\nJust now they are all going to bed, and--what do you think?--they unhook\r\nthe hinges of their wings and put them in a corner until they wake up\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, the hinges?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; the wings.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" said Zeb, \"explains why this house is used by them for a prison.\r\nIf any of the Gargoyles act badly, and have to be put in jail, they are\r\nbrought here and their wings unhooked and taken away from them until\r\nthey promise to be good.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wizard had listened intently to what Eureka had said.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had some of those loose wings,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Could we fly with them?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"I think so. If the Gargoyles can unhook the wings then the power to fly\r\nlies in the wings themselves, and not in the wooden bodies of the people\r\nwho wear them. So, if we had the wings, we could probably fly as well as\r\nthey do--at least while we are in their country and under the spell of\r\nits magic.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how would it help us to be able to fly?\" questioned the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Come here,\" said the little man, and took her to one of the corners of\r\nthe building. \"Do you see that big rock standing on the hillside\r\nyonder?\" he continued, pointing with his finger.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; it's a good way off, but I can see it,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"Well, inside that rock, which reaches up into the clouds, is an archway\r\nvery much like the one we entered when we climbed the spiral stairway\r\nfrom the Valley of Voe. I'll get my spy-glass, and then you can see it\r\nmore plainly.\"\r\n\r\nHe fetched a small but powerful telescope, which had been in his\r\nsatchel, and by its aid the little girl clearly saw the opening.\r\n\r\n\"Where does it lead to?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"That I cannot tell,\" said the Wizard; \"but we cannot now be far below\r\nthe earth's surface, and that entrance may lead to another stairway that\r\nwill bring us on top of our world again, where we belong. So, if we had\r\nthe wings, and could escape the Gargoyles, we might fly to that rock and\r\nbe saved.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll get you the wings,\" said Zeb, who had thoughtfully listened to all\r\nthis. \"That is, if the kitten will show me where they are.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can you get down?\" enquired the girl, wonderingly.\r\n\r\nFor answer Zeb began to unfasten Jim's harness, strap by strap, and\r\nto buckle one piece to another until he had made a long leather strip\r\nthat would reach to the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FIGHT WITH THE GARGOYLES.]\r\n\r\n\"I can climb down that, all right,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"No you can't,\" remarked Jim, with a twinkle in his round eyes. \"You may\r\n_go_ down, but you can only _climb_ up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll climb up when I get back, then,\" said the boy, with a laugh.\r\n\"Now, Eureka, you'll have to show me the way to those wings.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be very quiet,\" warned the kitten; \"for if you make the least\r\nnoise the Gargoyles will wake up. They can hear a pin drop.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to drop a pin,\" said Zeb.\r\n\r\nHe had fastened one end of the strap to a wheel of the buggy, and now he\r\nlet the line dangle over the side of the house.\r\n\r\n\"Be careful,\" cautioned Dorothy, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said the boy, and let himself slide over the edge.\r\n\r\nThe girl and the Wizard leaned over and watched Zeb work his way\r\ncarefully downward, hand over hand, until he stood upon the ground\r\nbelow. Eureka clung with her claws to the wooden side of the house and\r\nlet herself down easily. Then together they crept away to enter the low\r\ndoorway of a neighboring dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe watchers waited in breathless suspense until the boy again appeared,\r\nhis arms now full of the wooden wings.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to where the strap was hanging he tied the wings all in a\r\nbunch to the end of the line, and the Wizard drew them up. Then the line\r\nwas let down again for Zeb to climb up by. Eureka quickly followed him,\r\nand soon they were all standing together upon the platform, with eight\r\nof the much prized wooden wings beside them.\r\n\r\nThe boy was no longer sleepy, but full of energy and excitement. He put\r\nthe harness together again and hitched Jim to the buggy. Then, with the\r\nWizard's help, he tried to fasten some of the wings to the old\r\ncab-horse.\r\n\r\nThis was no easy task, because half of each one of the hinges of the\r\nwings was missing, it being still fastened to the body of the Gargoyle\r\nwho had used it. However, the Wizard went once more to his\r\nsatchel--which seemed to contain a surprising variety of odds and\r\nends--and brought out a spool of strong wire, by means of which they\r\nmanaged to fasten four of the wings to Jim's harness, two near his head\r\nand two near his tail. They were a bit wiggley, but secure enough if\r\nonly the harness held together.\r\n\r\nThe other four wings were then fastened to the buggy, two on each side,\r\nfor the buggy must bear the weight of the children and the Wizard as it\r\nflew through the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JIM FLUTTERED AND FLOUNDERED THROUGH THE AIR.]\r\n\r\nThese preparations had not consumed a great deal of time, but the\r\nsleeping Gargoyles were beginning to wake up and move around, and soon\r\nsome of them would be hunting for their missing wings. So the prisoners\r\nresolved to leave their prison at once.\r\n\r\nThey mounted into the buggy, Dorothy holding Eureka safe in her lap. The\r\ngirl sat in the middle of the seat, with Zeb and the Wizard on each side\r\nof her. When all was ready the boy shook the reins and said:\r\n\r\n\"Fly away, Jim!\"\r\n\r\n\"Which wings must I flop first?\" asked the cab-horse, undecidedly.\r\n\r\n\"Flop them all together,\" suggested the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"Some of them are crooked,\" objected the horse.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind; we will steer with the wings on the buggy,\" said Zeb. \"Just\r\nyou light out and make for that rock, Jim; and don't waste any time\r\nabout it, either.\"\r\n\r\nSo the horse gave a groan, flopped its four wings all together, and flew\r\naway from the platform. Dorothy was a little anxious about the success\r\nof their trip, for the way Jim arched his long neck and spread out his\r\nbony legs as he fluttered and floundered through the air was enough to\r\nmake anybody nervous. He groaned, too, as if frightened, and the wings\r\ncreaked dreadfully because the Wizard had forgotten to oil them; but\r\nthey kept fairly good time with the wings of the buggy, so that they\r\nmade excellent progress from the start. The only thing that anyone could\r\ncomplain of with justice was the fact that they wobbled first up and\r\nthen down, as if the road were rocky instead of being as smooth as the\r\nair could make it.\r\n\r\nThe main point, however, was that they flew, and flew swiftly, if a bit\r\nunevenly, toward the rock for which they had headed.\r\n\r\nSome of the Gargoyles saw them, presently, and lost no time in\r\ncollecting a band to pursue the escaping prisoners; so that when Dorothy\r\nhappened to look back she saw them coming in a great cloud that almost\r\ndarkened the sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13.\r\n\r\nTHE DEN OF THE DRAGONETTES\r\n\r\n\r\nOur friends had a good start and were able to maintain it, for with\r\ntheir eight wings they could go just as fast as could the Gargoyles. All\r\nthe way to the great rock the wooden people followed them, and when Jim\r\nfinally alighted at the mouth of the cavern the pursuers were still some\r\ndistance away.\r\n\r\n\"But, I'm afraid they'll catch us yet,\" said Dorothy, greatly excited.\r\n\r\n\"No; we must stop them,\" declared the Wizard. \"Quick Zeb, help me pull\r\noff these wooden wings!\"\r\n\r\nThey tore off the wings, for which they had no further use, and the\r\nWizard piled them in a heap just outside the entrance to the cavern.\r\nThen he poured over them all the kerosene oil that was left in his\r\noil-can, and lighting a match set fire to the pile.\r\n\r\nThe flames leaped up at once and the bonfire began to smoke and roar and\r\ncrackle just as the great army of wooden Gargoyles arrived. The\r\ncreatures drew back at once, being filled with fear and horror; for such\r\na dreadful thing as a fire they had never before known in all the\r\nhistory of their wooden land.\r\n\r\nInside the archway were several doors, leading to different rooms built\r\ninto the mountain, and Zeb and the Wizard lifted these wooden doors from\r\ntheir hinges and tossed them all on the flames.\r\n\r\n\"That will prove a barrier for some time to come,\" said the little man,\r\nsmiling pleasantly all over his wrinkled face at the success of their\r\nstratagem. \"Perhaps the flames will set fire to all that miserable\r\nwooden country, and if it does the loss will be very small and the\r\nGargoyles never will be missed. But come, my children; let us explore\r\nthe mountain and discover which way we must go in order to escape from\r\nthis cavern, which is getting to be almost as hot as a bake-oven.\"\r\n\r\nTo their disappointment there was within this mountain no regular flight\r\nof steps by means of which they could mount to the earth's surface. A\r\nsort of inclined tunnel led upward for a way, and they found the floor\r\nof it both rough and steep. Then a sudden turn brought them to a narrow\r\ngallery where the buggy could not pass. This delayed and bothered them\r\nfor a while, because they did not wish to leave the buggy behind them.\r\nIt carried their baggage and was useful to ride in wherever there were\r\ngood roads, and since it had accompanied them so far in their travels\r\nthey felt it their duty to preserve it. So Zeb and the Wizard set to\r\nwork and took off the wheels and the top, and then they put the buggy\r\nedgewise, so it would take up the smallest space. In this position they\r\nmanaged, with the aid of the patient cab-horse, to drag the vehicle\r\nthrough the narrow part of the passage. It was not a great distance,\r\nfortunately, and when the path grew broader they put the buggy together\r\nagain and proceeded more comfortably. But the road was nothing more than\r\na series of rifts or cracks in the mountain, and it went zig-zag in\r\nevery direction, slanting first up and then down until they were puzzled\r\nas to whether they were any nearer to the top of the earth than when\r\nthey had started, hours before.\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow,\" said Dorothy, \"we've 'scaped those awful Gurgles, and that's\r\n_one_ comfort!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"WHY IT'S A DRAGON!\"]\r\n\r\n\"Probably the Gargoyles are still busy trying to put out the fire,\"\r\nreturned the Wizard. \"But even if they succeeded in doing that it\r\nwould be very difficult for them to fly amongst these rocks; so I am\r\nsure we need fear them no longer.\"\r\n\r\nOnce in a while they would come to a deep crack in the floor, which made\r\nthe way quite dangerous; but there was still enough oil in the lanterns\r\nto give them light, and the cracks were not so wide but that they were\r\nable to jump over them. Sometimes they had to climb over heaps of loose\r\nrock, where Jim could scarcely drag the buggy. At such times Dorothy,\r\nZeb and the Wizard all pushed behind, and lifted the wheels over the\r\nroughest places; so they managed, by dint of hard work, to keep going.\r\nBut the little party was both weary and discouraged when at last, on\r\nturning a sharp corner, the wanderers found themselves in a vast cave\r\narching high over their heads and having a smooth, level floor.\r\n\r\nThe cave was circular in shape, and all around its edge, near to the\r\nground, appeared groups of dull yellow lights, two of them being always\r\nside by side. These were motionless at first, but soon began to flicker\r\nmore brightly and to sway slowly from side to side and then up and down.\r\n\r\n\"What sort of a place is this?\" asked the boy, trying to see more\r\nclearly through the gloom.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot imagine, I'm sure,\" answered the Wizard, also peering about.\r\n\r\n\"Woogh!\" snarled Eureka, arching her back until her hair stood straight\r\non end; \"it's a den of alligators, or crocodiles, or some other dreadful\r\ncreatures! Don't you see their terrible eyes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eureka sees better in the dark than we can,\" whispered Dorothy. \"Tell\r\nus, dear, what do the creatures look like?\" she asked, addressing her\r\npet.\r\n\r\n\"I simply can't describe 'em,\" answered the kitten, shuddering. \"Their\r\neyes are like pie-plates and their mouths like coal-scuttles. But their\r\nbodies don't seem very big.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are they?\" enquired the girl.\r\n\r\n\"They are in little pockets all around the edge of this cavern. Oh,\r\nDorothy--you can't imagine what horrid things they are! They're uglier\r\nthan the Gargoyles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut-tut! be careful how you criticise your neighbors,\" spoke a rasping\r\nvoice near by. \"As a matter of fact you are rather ugly-looking\r\ncreatures yourselves, and I'm sure mother has often told us we were the\r\nloveliest and prettiest things in all the world.\"\r\n\r\nHearing these words our friends turned in the direction of the sound,\r\nand the Wizard held his lanterns so that their light would flood one of\r\nthe little pockets in the rock.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's a dragon!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered the owner of the big yellow eyes which were blinking at\r\nthem so steadily; \"you are wrong about that. We hope to grow to be\r\ndragons some day, but just now we're only dragonettes.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Dorothy, gazing fearfully at the great scaley head,\r\nthe yawning mouth and the big eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Young dragons, of course; but we are not allowed to call ourselves real\r\ndragons until we get our full growth,\" was the reply. \"The big dragons\r\nare very proud, and don't think children amount to much; but mother says\r\nthat some day we will all be very powerful and important.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is your mother?\" asked the Wizard, anxiously looking around.\r\n\r\n\"She has gone up to the top of the earth to hunt for our dinner. If she\r\nhas good luck she will bring us an elephant, or a brace of rhinoceri, or\r\nperhaps a few dozen people to stay our hunger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh; are you hungry?\" enquired Dorothy, drawing back.\r\n\r\n\"Very,\" said the dragonette, snapping its jaws.\r\n\r\n\"And--and--do you eat people?\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure, when we can get them. But they've been very scarce for a\r\nfew years and we usually have to be content with elephants or\r\nbuffaloes,\" answered the creature, in a regretful tone.\r\n\r\n\"How old are you?\" enquired Zeb, who stared at the yellow eyes as if\r\nfascinated.\r\n\r\n\"Quite young, I grieve to say; and all of my brothers and sisters that\r\nyou see here are practically my own age. If I remember rightly, we were\r\nsixty-six years old the day before yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that isn't young!\" cried Dorothy, in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"No?\" drawled the dragonette; \"it seems to me very babyish.\"\r\n\r\n\"How old is your mother?\" asked the girl.\r\n\r\n\"Mother's about two thousand years old; but she carelessly lost track of\r\nher age a few centuries ago and skipped several hundreds. She's a little\r\nfussy, you know, and afraid of growing old, being a widow and still in\r\nher prime.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think she would be,\" agreed Dorothy. Then, after a moment's\r\nthought, she asked: \"Are we friends or enemies? I mean, will you be good\r\nto us, or do you intend to eat us?\"\r\n\r\n\"As for that, we dragonettes would love to eat you, my child; but\r\nunfortunately mother has tied all our tails around the rocks at the back\r\nof our individual caves, so that we can not crawl out to get you. If you\r\nchoose to come nearer we will make a mouthful of you in a wink; but\r\nunless you do you will remain quite safe.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a regretful accent in the creature's voice, and at the words\r\nall the other dragonettes sighed dismally.\r\n\r\nDorothy felt relieved. Presently she asked:\r\n\r\n\"Why did your mother tie your tails?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she is sometimes gone for several weeks on her hunting trips, and\r\nif we were not tied we would crawl all over the mountain and fight with\r\neach other and get into a lot of mischief. Mother usually knows what she\r\nis about, but she made a mistake this time; for you are sure to escape\r\nus unless you come too near, and you probably won't do that.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed!\" said the little girl. \"We don't wish to be eaten by such\r\nawful beasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Permit me to say,\" returned the dragonette, \"that you are rather\r\nimpolite to call us names, knowing that we cannot resent your insults.\r\nWe consider ourselves very beautiful in appearance, for mother has told\r\nus so, and she knows. And we are of an excellent family and have a\r\npedigree that I challenge any humans to equal, as it extends back about\r\ntwenty thousand years, to the time of the famous Green Dragon of\r\nAtlantis, who lived in a time when humans had not yet been created. Can\r\nyou match that pedigree, little girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Dorothy, \"I was born on a farm in Kansas, and I guess\r\nthat's being just as 'spectable and haughty as living in a cave with\r\nyour tail tied to a rock. If it isn't I'll have to stand it, that's\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tastes differ,\" murmured the dragonette, slowly drooping its scaley\r\neyelids over its yellow eyes, until they looked like half-moons.\r\n\r\nBeing reassured by the fact that the creatures could not crawl out of\r\ntheir rock-pockets, the children and the Wizard now took time to examine\r\nthem more closely. The heads of the dragonettes were as big as barrels\r\nand covered with hard, greenish scales that glittered brightly under the\r\nlight of the lanterns. Their front legs, which grew just back of their\r\nheads, were also strong and big; but their bodies were smaller around\r\nthan their heads, and dwindled away in a long line until their tails\r\nwere slim as a shoe-string. Dorothy thought, if it had taken them\r\nsixty-six years to grow to this size, that it would be fully a hundred\r\nyears more before they could hope to call themselves dragons, and that\r\nseemed like a good while to wait to grow up.\r\n\r\n\"It occurs to me,\" said the Wizard, \"that we ought to get out of this\r\nplace before the mother dragon comes back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't hurry,\" called one of the dragonettes; \"mother will be glad to\r\nmeet you, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be right,\" replied the Wizard, \"but we're a little particular\r\nabout associating with strangers. Will you kindly tell us which way your\r\nmother went to get on top the earth?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not a fair question to ask us,\" declared another dragonette.\r\n\"For, if we told you truly, you might escape us altogether; and if we\r\ntold you an untruth we would be naughty and deserve to be punished.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" decided Dorothy, \"we must find our way out the best we can.\"\r\n\r\nThey circled all around the cavern, keeping a good distance away from\r\nthe blinking yellow eyes of the dragonettes, and presently discovered\r\nthat there were two paths leading from the wall opposite to the place\r\nwhere they had entered. They selected one of these at a venture and\r\nhurried along it as fast as they could go, for they had no idea when the\r\nmother dragon would be back and were very anxious not to make her\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter 14.\r\n\r\nOZMA USES THE MAGIC BELT\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a considerable distance the way led straight upward in a gentle\r\nincline, and the wanderers made such good progress that they grew\r\nhopeful and eager, thinking they might see sunshine at any minute. But\r\nat length they came unexpectedly upon a huge rock that shut off the\r\npassage and blocked them from proceeding a single step farther.\r\n\r\nThis rock was separate from the rest of the mountain and was in motion,\r\nturning slowly around and around as if upon a pivot. When first they\r\ncame to it there was a solid wall before them; but presently it revolved\r\nuntil there was exposed a wide, smooth path across it to the other side.\r\nThis appeared so unexpectedly that they were unprepared to take\r\nadvantage of it at first, and allowed the rocky wall to swing around\r\nagain before they had decided to pass over. But they knew now that there\r\nwas a means of escape and so waited patiently until the path appeared\r\nfor the second time.\r\n\r\nThe children and the Wizard rushed across the moving rock and sprang\r\ninto the passage beyond, landing safely though a little out of breath.\r\nJim the cab-horse came last, and the rocky wall almost caught him; for\r\njust as he leaped to the floor of the further passage the wall swung\r\nacross it and a loose stone that the buggy wheels knocked against fell\r\ninto the narrow crack where the rock turned, and became wedged there.\r\n\r\nThey heard a crunching, grinding sound, a loud snap, and the turn-table\r\ncame to a stop with its broadest surface shutting off the path from\r\nwhich they had come.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said Zeb, \"we don't want to get back, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not so sure of that,\" returned Dorothy. \"The mother dragon may come\r\ndown and catch us here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is possible,\" agreed the Wizard, \"if this proves to be the path she\r\nusually takes. But I have been examining this tunnel, and I do not see\r\nany signs of so large a beast having passed through it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we're all right,\" said the girl, \"for if the dragon went the other\r\nway she can't poss'bly get to us now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not, my dear. But there is another thing to consider. The\r\nmother dragon probably knows the road to the earth's surface, and if she\r\nwent the other way then we have come the wrong way,\" said the Wizard,\r\nthoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" cried Dorothy. \"That would be unlucky, wouldn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very. Unless this passage also leads to the top of the earth,\" said\r\nZeb. \"For my part, if we manage to get out of here I'll be glad it isn't\r\nthe way the dragon goes.\"\r\n\r\n\"So will I,\" returned Dorothy. \"It's enough to have your pedigree flung\r\nin your face by those saucy dragonettes. No one knows what the mother\r\nmight do.\"\r\n\r\nThey now moved on again, creeping slowly up another steep incline. The\r\nlanterns were beginning to grow dim, and the Wizard poured the remaining\r\noil from one into the other, so that the one light would last longer.\r\nBut their journey was almost over, for in a short time they reached a\r\nsmall cave from which there was no further outlet.\r\n\r\nThey did not realize their ill fortune at first, for their hearts were\r\ngladdened by the sight of a ray of sunshine coming through a small crack\r\nin the roof of the cave, far overhead. That meant that their world--the\r\nreal world--was not very far away, and that the succession of perilous\r\nadventures they had encountered had at last brought them near the\r\nearth's surface, which meant home to them. But when the adventurers\r\nlooked more carefully around them they discovered that they were in a\r\nstrong prison from which there was no hope of escape.\r\n\r\n\"But we're _almost_ on earth again,\" cried Dorothy, \"for there is the\r\nsun--the most _beau'ful_ sun that shines!\" and she pointed eagerly at\r\nthe crack in the distant roof.\r\n\r\n\"Almost on earth isn't being there,\" said the kitten, in a discontented\r\ntone. \"It wouldn't be possible for even me to get up to that crack--or\r\nthrough it if I got there.\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears that the path ends here,\" announced the Wizard, gloomily.\r\n\r\n\"And there is no way to go back,\" added Zeb, with a low whistle of\r\nperplexity.\r\n\r\n\"I was sure it would come to this, in the end,\" remarked the old\r\ncab-horse. \"Folks don't fall into the middle of the earth and then get\r\nback again to tell of their adventures--not in real life. And the whole\r\nthing has been unnatural because that cat and I are both able to talk\r\nyour language, and to understand the words you say.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so can the nine tiny piglets,\" added Eureka. \"Don't forget them,\r\nfor I may have to eat them, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've heard animals talk before,\" said Dorothy, \"and no harm came of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you ever before shut up in a cave, far under the earth, with no\r\nway of getting out?\" enquired the horse, seriously.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Dorothy. \"But don't you lose heart, Jim, for I'm sure\r\nthis isn't the end of our story, by any means.\"\r\n\r\nThe reference to the piglets reminded the Wizard that his pets had not\r\nenjoyed much exercise lately, and must be tired of their prison in his\r\npocket. So he sat down upon the floor of the cave, brought the piglets\r\nout one by one, and allowed them to run around as much as they pleased.\r\n\r\n\"My dears,\" he said to them, \"I'm afraid I've got you into a lot of\r\ntrouble, and that you will never again be able to leave this gloomy\r\ncave.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's wrong?\" asked a piglet. \"We've been in the dark quite a while,\r\nand you may as well explain what has happened.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wizard told them of the misfortune that had overtaken the wanderers.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said another piglet, \"you are a wizard, are you not?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" replied the little man.\r\n\r\n\"Then you can do a few wizzes and get us out of this hole,\" declared the\r\ntiny one, with much confidence.\r\n\r\n\"I could if I happened to be a real wizard,\" returned the master sadly.\r\n\"But I'm not, my piggy-wees; I'm a humbug wizard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" cried several of the piglets, together.\r\n\r\n\"You can ask Dorothy,\" said the little man, in an injured tone.\r\n\r\n\"It's true enough,\" returned the girl, earnestly. \"Our friend Oz is\r\nmerely a humbug wizard, for he once proved it to me. He can do several\r\nvery wonderful things--if he knows how. But he can't wiz a single thing\r\nif he hasn't the tools and machinery to work with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, my dear, for doing me justice,\" responded the Wizard,\r\ngratefully. \"To be accused of being a real wizard, when I'm not, is a\r\nslander I will not tamely submit to. But I am one of the greatest humbug\r\nwizards that ever lived, and you will realize this when we have all\r\nstarved together and our bones are scattered over the floor of this\r\nlonely cave.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe we'll realize anything, when it comes to that,\"\r\nremarked Dorothy, who had been deep in thought. \"But I'm not going to\r\nscatter my bones just yet, because I need them, and you prob'ly need\r\nyours, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are helpless to escape,\" sighed the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"_We_ may be helpless,\" answered Dorothy, smiling at him, \"but there are\r\nothers who can do more than we can. Cheer up, friends. I'm sure Ozma\r\nwill help us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ozma!\" exclaimed the Wizard. \"Who is Ozma?\"\r\n\r\n\"The girl that rules the marvelous Land of Oz,\" was the reply. \"She's a\r\nfriend of mine, for I met her in the Land of Ev, not long ago, and went\r\nto Oz with her.\"\r\n\r\n\"For the second time?\" asked the Wizard, with great interest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The first time I went to Oz I found you there, ruling the Emerald\r\nCity. After you went up in a balloon, and escaped us, I got back to\r\nKansas by means of a pair of magical silver shoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember those shoes,\" said the little man, nodding. \"They once\r\nbelonged to the Wicked Witch. Have you them here with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I lost them somewhere in the air,\" explained the child. \"But the\r\nsecond time I went to the Land of Oz I owned the Nome King's Magic Belt,\r\nwhich is much more powerful than were the Silver Shoes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is that Magic Belt?\" enquired the Wizard, who had listened with\r\ngreat interest.\r\n\r\n\"Ozma has it; for its powers won't work in a common, ordinary country\r\nlike the United States. Anyone in a fairy country like the Land of Oz\r\ncan do anything with it; so I left it with my friend the Princess Ozma,\r\nwho used it to wish me in Australia with Uncle Henry.\"\r\n\r\n\"And were you?\" asked Zeb, astonished at what he heard.\r\n\r\n\"Of course; in just a jiffy. And Ozma has an enchanted picture hanging\r\nin her room that shows her the exact scene where any of her friends may\r\nbe, at any time she chooses. All she has to do is to say: 'I wonder what\r\nSo-and-so is doing,' and at once the picture shows where her friend is\r\nand what the friend is doing. That's _real_ magic, Mr. Wizard; isn't it?\r\nWell, every day at four o'clock Ozma has promised to look at me in that\r\npicture, and if I am in need of help I am to make her a certain sign and\r\nshe will put on the Nome King's Magic Belt and wish me to be with her in\r\nOz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that Princess Ozma will see this cave in her enchanted\r\npicture, and see all of us here, and what we are doing?\" demanded Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"Of course; when it is four o'clock,\" she replied, with a laugh at his\r\nstartled expression.\r\n\r\n\"And when you make a sign she will bring you to her in the Land of Oz?\"\r\ncontinued the boy.\r\n\r\n\"That's it, exactly; by means of the Magic Belt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the Wizard, \"you will be saved, little Dorothy; and I am\r\nvery glad of it. The rest of us will die much more cheerfully when we\r\nknow you have escaped our sad fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ won't die cheerfully!\" protested the kitten. \"There's nothing\r\ncheerful about dying that I could ever see, although they say a cat has\r\nnine lives, and so must die nine times.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you ever died yet?\" enquired the boy.\r\n\r\n\"No, and I'm not anxious to begin,\" said Eureka.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, dear,\" Dorothy exclaimed, \"I'll hold you in my arms, and\r\ntake you with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take us, too!\" cried the nine tiny piglets, all in one breath.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I can,\" answered Dorothy. \"I'll try.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you manage to hold me in your arms?\" asked the cab-horse.\r\n\r\nDorothy laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do better than that,\" she promised, \"for I can easily save you\r\nall, once I am myself in the Land of Oz.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" they asked.\r\n\r\n\"By using the Magic Belt. All I need do is to wish you with me, and\r\nthere you'll be--safe in the royal palace!\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" cried Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"I built that palace, and the Emerald City, too,\" remarked the Wizard,\r\nin a thoughtful tone, \"and I'd like to see them again, for I was very\r\nhappy among the Munchkins and Winkies and Quadlings and Gillikins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who are they?\" asked the boy.\r\n\r\n\"The four nations that inhabit the Land of Oz,\" was the reply. \"I wonder\r\nif they would treat me nicely if I went there again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they would!\" declared Dorothy. \"They are still proud of their\r\nformer Wizard, and often speak of you kindly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you happen to know whatever became of the Tin Woodman and the\r\nScarecrow?\" he enquired.\r\n\r\n\"They live in Oz yet,\" said the girl, \"and are very important people.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Cowardly Lion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he lives there too, with his friend the Hungry Tiger; and Billina\r\nis there, because she liked the place better than Kansas, and wouldn't\r\ngo with me to Australia.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't know the Hungry Tiger and Billina,\" said the Wizard,\r\nshaking his head. \"Is Billina a girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; she's a yellow hen, and a great friend of mine. You're sure to like\r\nBillina, when you know her,\" asserted Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Your friends sound like a menagerie,\" remarked Zeb, uneasily.\r\n\"Couldn't you wish me in some safer place than Oz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" replied the girl. \"You'll just love the folks in Oz, when\r\nyou get acquainted. What time is it, Mr. Wizard?\"\r\n\r\nThe little man looked at his watch--a big silver one that he carried in\r\nhis vest pocket.\r\n\r\n\"Half-past three,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Then we must wait for half an hour,\" she continued; \"but it won't take\r\nlong, after that, to carry us all to the Emerald City.\"\r\n\r\nThey sat silently thinking for a time. Then Jim suddenly asked:\r\n\r\n\"Are there any horses in Oz?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only one,\" replied Dorothy, \"and he's a sawhorse.\"\r\n\r\n\"A what?\"\r\n\r\n\"A sawhorse. Princess Ozma once brought him to life with a witch-powder,\r\nwhen she was a boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was Ozma once a boy?\" asked Zeb, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; a wicked witch enchanted her, so she could not rule her kingdom.\r\nBut she's a girl now, and the sweetest, loveliest girl in all the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sawhorse is a thing they saw boards on,\" remarked Jim, with a sniff.\r\n\r\n\"It is when it's not alive,\" acknowledged the girl. \"But this sawhorse\r\ncan trot as fast as you can, Jim; and he's very wise, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pah! I'll race the miserable wooden donkey any day in the week!\" cried\r\nthe cab-horse.\r\n\r\nDorothy did not reply to that. She felt that Jim would know more about\r\nthe Saw-Horse later on.\r\n\r\nThe time dragged wearily enough to the eager watchers, but finally the\r\nWizard announced that four o'clock had arrived, and Dorothy caught up\r\nthe kitten and began to make the signal that had been agreed upon to the\r\nfar-away, invisible Ozma.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing seems to happen,\" said Zeb, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we must give Ozma time to put on the Magic Belt,\" replied the girl.\r\n\r\nShe had scarcely spoken the words when she suddenly disappeared from the\r\ncave, and with her went the kitten. There had been no sound of any kind\r\nand no warning. One moment Dorothy sat beside them with the kitten in\r\nher lap, and a moment later the horse, the piglets, the Wizard and the\r\nboy were all that remained in the underground prison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOROTHY MADE THE SIGNAL.]\r\n\r\n\"I believe we will soon follow her,\" announced the Wizard, in a tone of\r\ngreat relief; \"for I know something about the magic of the fairyland\r\nthat is called the Land of Oz. Let us be ready, for we may be sent for\r\nany minute.\"\r\n\r\nHe put the piglets safely away in his pocket again and then he and Zeb\r\ngot into the buggy and sat expectantly upon the seat.\r\n\r\n\"Will it hurt?\" asked the boy, in a voice that trembled a little.\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" replied the Wizard. \"It will all happen as quick as a\r\nwink.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that was the way it did happen.\r\n\r\nThe cab-horse gave a nervous start and Zeb began to rub his eyes to make\r\nsure he was not asleep. For they were in the streets of a beautiful\r\nemerald-green city, bathed in a grateful green light that was especially\r\npleasing to their eyes, and surrounded by merry faced people in gorgeous\r\ngreen-and-gold costumes of many extraordinary designs.\r\n\r\nBefore them were the jewel-studded gates of a magnificent palace, and\r\nnow the gates opened slowly as if inviting them to enter the courtyard,\r\nwhere splendid flowers were blooming and pretty fountains shot their\r\nsilvery sprays into the air.\r\n\r\nZeb shook the reins to rouse the cab-horse from his stupor of amazement,\r\nfor the people were beginning to gather around and stare at the\r\nstrangers.\r\n\r\n\"Gid-dap!\" cried the boy, and at the word Jim slowly trotted into the\r\ncourtyard and drew the buggy along the jewelled driveway to the great\r\nentrance of the royal palace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15.\r\n\r\nOLD FRIENDS ARE REUNITED\r\n\r\n\r\nMany servants dressed in handsome uniforms stood ready to welcome the\r\nnew arrivals, and when the Wizard got out of the buggy a pretty girl in\r\na green gown cried out in surprise:\r\n\r\n\"Why, it's Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, come back again!\"\r\n\r\nThe little man looked at her closely and then took both the maiden's\r\nhands in his and shook them cordially.\r\n\r\n\"On my word,\" he exclaimed, \"it's little Jellia Jamb--as pert and pretty\r\nas ever!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, Mr. Wizard?\" asked Jellia, bowing low. \"But I'm afraid you\r\ncannot rule the Emerald City, as you used to, because we now have a\r\nbeautiful Princess whom everyone loves dearly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the people will not willingly part with her,\" added a tall soldier\r\nin a Captain-General's uniform.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard turned to look at him.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not wear green whiskers at one time?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the soldier; \"but I shaved them off long ago, and since then\r\nI have risen from a private to be the Chief General of the Royal\r\nArmies.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's nice,\" said the little man. \"But I assure you, my good people,\r\nthat I do not wish to rule the Emerald City,\" he added, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"In that case you are very welcome!\" cried all the servants, and it\r\npleased the Wizard to note the respect with which the royal retainers\r\nbowed before him. His fame had not been forgotten in the Land of Oz, by\r\nany means.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Dorothy?\" enquired Zeb, anxiously, as he left the buggy and\r\nstood beside his friend the little Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"She is with the Princess Ozma, in the private rooms of the palace,\"\r\nreplied Jellia Jamb. \"But she has ordered me to make you welcome and to\r\nshow you to your apartments.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy looked around him with wondering eyes. Such magnificence and\r\nwealth as was displayed in this palace was more than he had ever dreamed\r\nof, and he could scarcely believe that all the gorgeous glitter was real\r\nand not tinsel.\r\n\r\n\"What's to become of me?\" asked the horse, uneasily. He had seen\r\nconsiderable of life in the cities in his younger days, and knew that\r\nthis regal palace was no place for him.\r\n\r\nIt perplexed even Jellia Jamb, for a time, to know what to do with the\r\nanimal. The green maiden was much astonished at the sight of so unusual\r\na creature, for horses were unknown in this Land; but those who lived in\r\nthe Emerald City were apt to be astonished by queer sights, so after\r\ninspecting the cab-horse and noting the mild look in his big eyes the\r\ngirl decided not to be afraid of him.\r\n\r\n\"There are no stables here,\" said the Wizard, \"unless some have been\r\nbuilt since I went away.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have never needed them before,\" answered Jellia; \"for the Sawhorse\r\nlives in a room of the palace, being much smaller and more natural in\r\nappearance than this great beast you have brought with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that I'm a freak?\" asked Jim, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" she hastened to say, \"there may be many more like you in the\r\nplace you came from, but in Oz any horse but a Sawhorse is unusual.\"\r\n\r\nThis mollified Jim a little, and after some thought the green maiden\r\ndecided to give the cab-horse a room in the palace, such a big building\r\nhaving many rooms that were seldom in use.\r\n\r\nSo Zeb unharnessed Jim, and several of the servants then led the horse\r\naround to the rear, where they selected a nice large apartment that he\r\ncould have all to himself.\r\n\r\nThen Jellia said to the Wizard:\r\n\r\n\"Your own room--which was back of the great Throne Room--has been vacant\r\never since you left us. Would you like it again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed!\" returned the little man. \"It will seem like being at home\r\nagain, for I lived in that room for many, many years.\"\r\n\r\nHe knew the way to it, and a servant followed him, carrying his satchel.\r\nZeb was also escorted to a room--so grand and beautiful that he almost\r\nfeared to sit in the chairs or lie upon the bed, lest he might dim their\r\nsplendor. In the closets he discovered many fancy costumes of rich\r\nvelvets and brocades, and one of the attendants told him to dress\r\nhimself in any of the clothes that pleased him and to be prepared to\r\ndine with the Princess and Dorothy in an hour's time.\r\n\r\nOpening from the chamber was a fine bath-room having a marble tub with\r\nperfumed water; so the boy, still dazed by the novelty of his\r\nsurroundings, indulged in a good bath and then selected a maroon velvet\r\ncostume with silver buttons to replace his own soiled and much worn\r\nclothing. There were silk stockings and soft leather slippers with\r\ndiamond buckles to accompany his new costume, and when he was fully\r\ndressed Zeb looked much more dignified and imposing than ever before in\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nHe was all ready when an attendant came to escort him to the presence of\r\nthe Princess; he followed bashfully and was ushered into a room more\r\ndainty and attractive than it was splendid. Here he found Dorothy seated\r\nbeside a young girl so marvelously beautiful that the boy stopped\r\nsuddenly with a gasp of admiration.\r\n\r\nBut Dorothy sprang up and ran to seize her friend's hand, drawing him\r\nimpulsively toward the lovely Princess, who smiled most graciously upon\r\nher guest. Then the Wizard entered, and his presence relieved the boy's\r\nembarrassment. The little man was clothed in black velvet, with many\r\nsparkling emerald ornaments decorating his breast; but his bald head and\r\nwrinkled features made him appear more amusing than impressive.\r\n\r\nOzma had been quite curious to meet the famous man who had built the\r\nEmerald City and united the Munchkins, Gillikins, Quadlings and Winkies\r\ninto one people; so when they were all four seated at the dinner table\r\nthe Princess said:\r\n\r\n\"Please tell me, Mr. Wizard, whether you called yourself Oz after this\r\ngreat country, or whether you believe my country is called Oz after you.\r\nIt is a matter that I have long wished to enquire about, because you are\r\nof a strange race and my own name is Ozma. No one, I am sure, is better\r\nable to explain this mystery than you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true,\" answered the little Wizard; \"therefore it will give me\r\npleasure to explain my connection with your country. In the first place,\r\nI must tell you that I was born in Omaha, and my father, who was a\r\npolitician, named me Oscar Zoroaster Phadrig Isaac Norman Henkle\r\nEmmannuel Ambroise Diggs, Diggs being the last name because he could\r\nthink of no more to go before it. Taken altogether, it was a dreadfully\r\nlong name to weigh down a poor innocent child, and one of the hardest\r\nlessons I ever learned was to remember my own name. When I grew up I\r\njust called myself O. Z., because the other initials were P-I-N-H-E-A-D;\r\nand that spelled 'pinhead,' which was a reflection on my intelligence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely no one could blame you for cutting your name short,\" said Ozma,\r\nsympathetically. \"But didn't you cut it almost too short?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps so,\" replied the Wizard. \"When a young man I ran away from home\r\nand joined a circus. I used to call myself a Wizard, and do tricks of\r\nventriloquism.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does that mean?\" asked the Princess.\r\n\r\n\"Throwing my voice into any object I pleased, to make it appear that the\r\nobject was speaking instead of me. Also I began to make balloon\r\nascensions. On my balloon and on all the other articles I used in the\r\ncircus I painted the two initials: 'O. Z.', to show that those things\r\nbelonged to me.\r\n\r\n\"One day my balloon ran away with me and brought me across the deserts\r\nto this beautiful country. When the people saw me come from the sky they\r\nnaturally thought me some superior creature, and bowed down before me. I\r\ntold them I was a Wizard, and showed them some easy tricks that amazed\r\nthem; and when they saw the initials painted on the balloon they called\r\nme Oz.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I begin to understand,\" said the Princess, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"At that time,\" continued the Wizard, busily eating his soup while\r\ntalking, \"there were four separate countries in this Land, each one of\r\nthe four being ruled by a Witch. But the people thought my power was\r\ngreater than that of the Witches; and perhaps the Witches thought so\r\ntoo, for they never dared oppose me. I ordered the Emerald City to be\r\nbuilt just where the four countries cornered together, and when it was\r\ncompleted I announced myself the Ruler of the Land of Oz, which included\r\nall the four countries of the Munchkins, the Gillikins, the Winkies and\r\nthe Quadlings. Over this Land I ruled in peace for many years, until I\r\ngrew old and longed to see my native city once again. So when Dorothy\r\nwas first blown to this place by a cyclone I arranged to go away with\r\nher in a balloon; but the balloon escaped too soon and carried me back\r\nalone. After many adventures I reached Omaha, only to find that all my\r\nold friends were dead or had moved away. So, having nothing else to do,\r\nI joined a circus again, and made my balloon ascensions until the\r\nearthquake caught me.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is quite a history,\" said Ozma; \"but there is a little more\r\nhistory about the Land of Oz that you do not seem to understand--perhaps\r\nfor the reason that no one ever told it you. Many years before you came\r\nhere this Land was united under one Ruler, as it is now, and the Ruler's\r\nname was always 'Oz', which means in our language 'Great and Good'; or,\r\nif the Ruler happened to be a woman, her name was always 'Ozma.' But\r\nonce upon a time four Witches leagued together to depose the king and\r\nrule the four parts of the kingdom themselves; so when the Ruler, my\r\ngrandfather, was hunting one day, one Wicked Witch named Mombi stole him\r\nand carried him away, keeping him a close prisoner. Then the Witches\r\ndivided up the kingdom, and ruled the four parts of it until you came\r\nhere. That was why the people were so glad to see you, and why they\r\nthought from your initials that you were their rightful ruler.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, at that time,\" said the Wizard, thoughtfully, \"there were two Good\r\nWitches and two Wicked Witches ruling in the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Ozma, \"because a good Witch had conquered Mombi in the\r\nNorth and Glinda the Good had conquered the evil Witch in the South. But\r\nMombi was still my grandfather's jailor, and afterward my father's\r\njailor. When I was born she transformed me into a boy, hoping that no\r\none would ever recognize me and know that I was the rightful Princess of\r\nthe Land of Oz. But I escaped from her and am now the Ruler of my\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very glad of that,\" said the Wizard, \"and hope you will consider\r\nme one of your most faithful and devoted subjects.\"\r\n\r\n\"We owe a great deal to the Wonderful Wizard,\" continued the Princess,\r\n\"for it was you who built this splendid Emerald City.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your people built it,\" he answered. \"I only bossed the job, as we say\r\nin Omaha.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you ruled it wisely and well for many years,\" said she, \"and made\r\nthe people proud of your magical art. So, as you are now too old to\r\nwander abroad and work in a circus, I offer you a home here as long as\r\nyou live. You shall be the Official Wizard of my kingdom, and be treated\r\nwith every respect and consideration.\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept your kind offer with gratitude, gracious Princess,\" the little\r\nman said, in a soft voice, and they could all see that tear-drops were\r\nstanding in his keen old eyes. It meant a good deal to him to secure a\r\nhome like this.\r\n\r\n\"He's only a humbug Wizard, though,\" said Dorothy, smiling at him.\r\n\r\n\"And that is the safest kind of a Wizard to have,\" replied Ozma,\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\n\"Oz can do some good tricks, humbug or no humbug,\" announced Zeb, who\r\nwas now feeling more at ease.\r\n\r\n\"He shall amuse us with his tricks tomorrow,\" said the Princess. \"I have\r\nsent messengers to summon all of Dorothy's old friends to meet her and\r\ngive her welcome, and they ought to arrive very soon, now.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, the dinner was no sooner finished than in rushed the Scarecrow,\r\nto hug Dorothy in his padded arms and tell her how glad he was to see\r\nher again. The Wizard was also most heartily welcomed by the straw man,\r\nwho was an important personage in the Land of Oz.\r\n\r\n\"How are your brains?\" enquired the little humbug, as he grasped the\r\nsoft, stuffed hands of his old friend.\r\n\r\n\"Working finely,\" answered the Scarecrow. \"I'm very certain, Oz, that\r\nyou gave me the best brains in the world, for I can think with them day\r\nand night, when all other brains are fast asleep.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOROTHY AND OZMA.]\r\n\r\n\"How long did you rule the Emerald City, after I left here?\" was the\r\nnext question.\r\n\r\n\"Quite awhile, until I was conquered by a girl named General Jinjur. But\r\nOzma soon conquered her, with the help of Glinda the Good, and after\r\nthat I went to live with Nick Chopper, the Tin Woodman.\"\r\n\r\nJust then a loud cackling was heard outside; and, when a servant threw\r\nopen the door with a low bow, a yellow hen strutted in. Dorothy sprang\r\nforward and caught the fluffy fowl in her arms, uttering at the same\r\ntime a glad cry.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Billina!\" she said; \"how fat and sleek you've grown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why shouldn't I?\" asked the hen, in a sharp, clear voice. \"I live on\r\nthe fat of the land--don't I, Ozma?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have everything you wish for,\" said the Princess.\r\n\r\nAround Billina's neck was a string of beautiful pearls, and on her legs\r\nwere bracelets of emeralds. She nestled herself comfortably in Dorothy's\r\nlap until the kitten gave a snarl of jealous anger and leaped up with a\r\nsharp claw fiercely bared to strike Billina a blow. But the little girl\r\ngave the angry kitten such a severe cuff that it jumped down again\r\nwithout daring to scratch.\r\n\r\n\"How horrid of you, Eureka!\" cried Dorothy. \"Is that the way to treat my\r\nfriends?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have queer friends, seems to me,\" replied the kitten, in a surly\r\ntone.\r\n\r\n\"Seems to me the same way,\" said Billina, scornfully, \"if that beastly\r\ncat is one of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here!\" said Dorothy, sternly. \"I won't have any quarrelling in the\r\nLand of Oz, I can tell you! Everybody lives in peace here, and loves\r\neverybody else; and unless you two, Billina and Eureka, make up and be\r\nfriends, I'll take my Magic Belt and wish you both home again,\r\n_immejitly_. So, there!\"\r\n\r\nThey were both much frightened at the threat, and promised meekly to be\r\ngood. But it was never noticed that they became very warm friends, for\r\nall of that.\r\n\r\nAnd now the Tin Woodman arrived, his body most beautifully\r\nnickle-plated, so that it shone splendidly in the brilliant light of the\r\nroom. The Tin Woodman loved Dorothy most tenderly, and welcomed with joy\r\nthe return of the little old Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said he to the latter, \"I never can thank you enough for the\r\nexcellent heart you once gave me. It has made me many friends, I assure\r\nyou, and it beats as kindly and lovingly today as it ever did.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad to hear that,\" said the Wizard. \"I was afraid it would get\r\nmoldy in that tin body of yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" returned Nick Chopper. \"It keeps finely, being preserved\r\nin my air-tight chest.\"\r\n\r\nZeb was a little shy when first introduced to these queer people; but\r\nthey were so friendly and sincere that he soon grew to admire them very\r\nmuch, even finding some good qualities in the yellow hen. But he became\r\nnervous again when the next visitor was announced.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said Princess Ozma, \"is my friend Mr. H. M. Woggle-Bug, T. E.,\r\nwho assisted me one time when I was in great distress, and is now the\r\nDean of the Royal College of Athletic Science.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the Wizard; \"I'm pleased to meet so distinguished a\r\npersonage.\"\r\n\r\n\"H. M.,\" said the Woggle-Bug, pompously, \"means Highly Magnified; and T.\r\nE. means Thoroughly Educated. I am, in reality, a very big bug, and\r\ndoubtless the most intelligent being in all this broad domain.\"\r\n\r\n\"How well you disguise it,\" said the Wizard. \"But I don't doubt your\r\nword in the least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nobody doubts it, sir,\" replied the Woggle-Bug, and drawing a book from\r\nits pocket the strange insect turned its back on the company and sat\r\ndown in a corner to read.\r\n\r\nNobody minded this rudeness, which might have seemed more impolite in\r\none less thoroughly educated; so they straightway forgot him and joined\r\nin a merry conversation that kept them well amused until bed-time\r\narrived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16.\r\n\r\nJIM, THE CAB-HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\nJim the Cab-horse found himself in possession of a large room with a\r\ngreen marble floor and carved marble wainscoting, which was so stately\r\nin its appearance that it would have awed anyone else. Jim accepted it\r\nas a mere detail, and at his command the attendants gave his coat a good\r\nrubbing, combed his mane and tail, and washed his hoofs and fetlocks.\r\nThen they told him dinner would be served directly and he replied that\r\nthey could not serve it too quickly to suit his convenience. First they\r\nbrought him a steaming bowl of soup, which the horse eyed in dismay.\r\n\r\n\"Take that stuff away!\" he commanded. \"Do you take me for a\r\nsalamander?\"\r\n\r\nThey obeyed at once, and next served a fine large turbot on a silver\r\nplatter, with drawn gravey poured over it.\r\n\r\n\"Fish!\" cried Jim, with a sniff. \"Do you take me for a tom-cat? Away\r\nwith it!\"\r\n\r\nThe servants were a little discouraged, but soon they brought in a great\r\ntray containing two dozen nicely roasted quail on toast.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" said the horse, now thoroughly provoked. \"Do you take me\r\nfor a weasel? How stupid and ignorant you are, in the Land of Oz, and\r\nwhat dreadful things you feed upon! Is there nothing that is decent to\r\neat in this palace?\"\r\n\r\nThe trembling servants sent for the Royal Steward, who came in haste and\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"What would your Highness like for dinner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Highness!\" repeated Jim, who was unused to such titles.\r\n\r\n\"You are at least six feet high, and that is higher than any other\r\nanimal in this country,\" said the Steward.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my Highness would like some oats,\" declared the horse.\r\n\r\n\"Oats? We have no whole oats,\" the Steward replied, with much\r\ndefference. \"But there is any quantity of oatmeal, which we often cook\r\nfor breakfast. Oatmeal is a breakfast dish,\" added the Steward, humbly.\r\n\r\n\"I'll make it a dinner dish,\" said Jim. \"Fetch it on, but don't cook it,\r\nas you value your life.\"\r\n\r\nYou see, the respect shown the worn-out old cab-horse made him a little\r\narrogant, and he forgot he was a guest, never having been treated\r\notherwise than as a servant since the day he was born, until his arrival\r\nin the Land of Oz. But the royal attendants did not heed the animal's\r\nill temper. They soon mixed a tub of oatmeal with a little water, and\r\nJim ate it with much relish.\r\n\r\nThen the servants heaped a lot of rugs upon the floor and the old horse\r\nslept on the softest bed he had ever known in his life.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, as soon as it was daylight, he resolved to take a walk\r\nand try to find some grass for breakfast; so he ambled calmly through\r\nthe handsome arch of the doorway, turned the corner of the palace,\r\nwherein all seemed asleep, and came face to face with the Sawhorse.\r\n\r\nJim stopped abruptly, being startled and amazed. The Sawhorse stopped at\r\nthe same time and stared at the other with its queer protruding eyes,\r\nwhich were mere knots in the log that formed its body. The legs of the\r\nSawhorse were four sticks driven into holes bored in the log; its tail\r\nwas a small branch that had been left by accident and its mouth a place\r\nchopped in one end of the body which projected a little and served as\r\na head. The ends of the wooden legs were shod with plates of solid gold,\r\nand the saddle of the Princess Ozma, which was of red leather set with\r\nsparkling diamonds, was strapped to the clumsy body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"FOR GOODNESS SAKE, WHAT SORT OF A BEING ARE YOU?\"]\r\n\r\nJim's eyes stuck out as much as those of the Sawhorse, and he stared at\r\nthe creature with his ears erect and his long head drawn back until it\r\nrested against his arched neck.\r\n\r\nIn this comical position the two horses circled slowly around each other\r\nfor a while, each being unable to realize what the singular thing might\r\nbe which it now beheld for the first time. Then Jim exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"For goodness sake, what sort of a being are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a Sawhorse,\" replied the other.\r\n\r\n\"Oh; I believe I've heard of you,\" said the cab-horse; \"but you are\r\nunlike anything that I expected to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt it,\" the Sawhorse observed, with a tone of pride. \"I am\r\nconsidered quite unusual.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are, indeed. But a rickety wooden thing like you has no right to be\r\nalive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't help it,\" returned the other, rather crestfallen. \"Ozma\r\nsprinkled me with a magic powder, and I just had to live. I know I'm not\r\nmuch account; but I'm the only horse in all the Land of Oz, so they\r\ntreat me with great respect.\"\r\n\r\n\"You, a horse!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, not a real one, of course. There are no real horses here at all.\r\nBut I'm a splendid imitation of one.\"\r\n\r\nJim gave an indignant neigh.\r\n\r\n\"Look at me!\" he cried. \"Behold a real horse!\"\r\n\r\nThe wooden animal gave a start, and then examined the other intently.\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible that you are a Real Horse?\" he murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Not only possible, but true,\" replied Jim, who was gratified by the\r\nimpression he had created. \"It is proved by my fine points. For example,\r\nlook at the long hairs on my tail, with which I can whisk away the\r\nflies.\"\r\n\r\n\"The flies never trouble me,\" said the Saw-Horse.\r\n\r\n\"And notice my great strong teeth, with which I nibble the grass.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not necessary for me to eat,\" observed the Saw-horse.\r\n\r\n\"Also examine my broad chest, which enables me to draw deep, full\r\nbreaths,\" said Jim, proudly.\r\n\r\n\"I have no need to breathe,\" returned the other.\r\n\r\n\"No; you miss many pleasures,\" remarked the cab-horse, pityingly. \"You\r\ndo not know the relief of brushing away a fly that has bitten you, nor\r\nthe delight of eating delicious food, nor the satisfaction of drawing a\r\nlong breath of fresh, pure air. You may be an imitation of a horse, but\r\nyou're a mighty poor one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I cannot hope ever to be like you,\" sighed the Sawhorse. \"But I am\r\nglad to meet at last a Real Horse. You are certainly the most beautiful\r\ncreature I ever beheld.\"\r\n\r\nThis praise won Jim completely. To be called beautiful was a novelty in\r\nhis experience. Said he:\r\n\r\n\"Your chief fault, my friend, is in being made of wood, and that I\r\nsuppose you cannot help. Real horses, like myself, are made of flesh and\r\nblood and bones.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can see the bones all right,\" replied the Sawhorse, \"and they are\r\nadmirable and distinct. Also I can see the flesh. But the blood, I\r\nsuppose, is tucked away inside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly,\" said Jim.\r\n\r\n\"What good is it?\" asked the Sawhorse.\r\n\r\nJim did not know, but he would not tell the Sawhorse that.\r\n\r\n\"If anything cuts me,\" he replied, \"the blood runs out to show where I\r\nam cut. You, poor thing! cannot even bleed when you are hurt.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I am never hurt,\" said the Sawhorse. \"Once in a while I get broken\r\nup some, but I am easily repaired and put in good order again. And I\r\nnever feel a break or a splinter in the least.\"\r\n\r\nJim was almost tempted to envy the wooden horse for being unable to feel\r\npain; but the creature was so absurdly unnatural that he decided he\r\nwould not change places with it under any circumstances.\r\n\r\n\"How did you happen to be shod with gold?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Princess Ozma did that,\" was the reply; \"and it saves my legs from\r\nwearing out. We've had a good many adventures together, Ozma and I, and\r\nshe likes me.\"\r\n\r\nThe cab-horse was about to reply when suddenly he gave a start and a\r\nneigh of terror and stood trembling like a leaf. For around the corner\r\nhad come two enormous savage beasts, treading so lightly that they were\r\nupon him before he was aware of their presence. Jim was in the act of\r\nplunging down the path to escape when the Sawhorse cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Stop, my brother! Stop, Real Horse! These are friends, and will do you\r\nno harm.\"\r\n\r\nJim hesitated, eyeing the beasts fearfully. One was an enormous Lion\r\nwith clear, intelligent eyes, a tawney mane bushy and well kept, and a\r\nbody like yellow plush. The other was a great Tiger with purple stripes\r\naround his lithe body, powerful limbs, and eyes that showed through the\r\nhalf closed lids like coals of fire. The huge forms of these monarchs of\r\nthe forest and jungle were enough to strike terror to the stoutest\r\nheart, and it is no wonder Jim was afraid to face them.\r\n\r\nBut the Sawhorse introduced the stranger in a calm tone, saying,\r\n\r\n\"This, noble Horse, is my friend the Cowardly Lion, who is the valiant\r\nKing of the Forest, but at the same time a faithful vassal of Princess\r\nOzma. And this is the Hungry Tiger, the terror of the jungle, who longs\r\nto devour fat babies but is prevented by his conscience from doing so.\r\nThese royal beasts are both warm friends of little Dorothy and have come\r\nto the Emerald City this morning to welcome her to our fairyland.\"\r\n\r\nHearing these words Jim resolved to conquer his alarm. He bowed his head\r\nwith as much dignity as he could muster toward the savage looking\r\nbeasts, who in return nodded in a friendly way.\r\n\r\n\"Is not the Real Horse a beautiful animal?\" asked the Sawhorse\r\nadmiringly.\r\n\r\n\"That is doubtless a matter of taste,\" returned the Lion. \"In the forest\r\nhe would be thought ungainly, because his face is stretched out and his\r\nneck is uselessly long. His joints, I notice, are swollen and overgrown,\r\nand he lacks flesh and is old in years.\"\r\n\r\n\"And dreadfully tough,\" added the Hungry Tiger, in a sad voice. \"My\r\nconscience would never permit me to eat so tough a morsel as the Real\r\nHorse.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad of that,\" said Jim; \"for I, also, have a conscience, and it\r\ntells me not to crush in your skull with a blow of my powerful hoof.\"\r\n\r\nIf he thought to frighten the striped beast by such language he was\r\nmistaken. The Tiger seemed to smile, and winked one eye slowly.\r\n\r\n\"You have a good conscience, friend Horse,\" it said, \"and if you attend\r\nto its teachings it will do much to protect you from harm. Some day I\r\nwill let you try to crush in my skull, and afterward you will know more\r\nabout tigers than you do now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any friend of Dorothy,\" remarked the Cowardly Lion, \"must be our\r\nfriend, as well. So let us cease this talk of skull crushing and\r\nconverse upon more pleasant subjects. Have you breakfasted, Sir Horse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" replied Jim. \"But here is plenty of excellent clover, so if\r\nyou will excuse me I will eat now.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's a vegetarian,\" remarked the Tiger, as the horse began to munch the\r\nclover. \"If I could eat grass I would not need a conscience, for nothing\r\ncould then tempt me to devour babies and lambs.\"\r\n\r\nJust then Dorothy, who had risen early and heard the voices of the\r\nanimals, ran out to greet her old friends. She hugged both the Lion and\r\nthe Tiger with eager delight, but seemed to love the King of Beasts a\r\nlittle better than she did his hungry friend, having known him longer.\r\n\r\nBy the time they had indulged in a good talk and Dorothy had told them\r\nall about the awful earthquake and her recent adventures, the breakfast\r\nbell rang from the palace and the little girl went inside to join her\r\nhuman comrades. As she entered the great hall a voice called out, in a\r\nrather harsh tone:\r\n\r\n\"What! are _you_ here again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am,\" she answered, looking all around to see where the voice\r\ncame from.\r\n\r\n\"What brought you back?\" was the next question, and Dorothy's eye rested\r\non an antlered head hanging on the wall just over the fireplace, and\r\ncaught its lips in the act of moving.\r\n\r\n\"Good gracious!\" she exclaimed. \"I thought you were stuffed.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I am,\" replied the head. \"But once on a time I was part of the Gump,\r\nwhich Ozma sprinkled with the Powder of Life. I was then for a time the\r\nHead of the finest Flying Machine that was ever known to exist, and we\r\ndid many wonderful things. Afterward the Gump was taken apart and I was\r\nput back on this wall; but I can still talk when I feel in the mood,\r\nwhich is not often.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very strange,\" said the girl. \"What were you when you were first\r\nalive?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I have forgotten,\" replied the Gump's Head, \"and I do not think it\r\nis of much importance. But here comes Ozma; so I'd better hush up, for\r\nthe Princess doesn't like me to chatter since she changed her name from\r\nTip to Ozma.\"\r\n\r\nJust then the girlish Ruler of Oz opened the door and greeted Dorothy\r\nwith a good-morning kiss. The little Princess seemed fresh and rosy and\r\nin good spirits.\r\n\r\n\"Breakfast is served, dear,\" she said, \"and I am hungry. So don't let us\r\nkeep it waiting a single minute.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JIM STOOD TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17.\r\n\r\nTHE NINE TINY PIGLETS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast Ozma announced that she had ordered a holiday to be\r\nobserved throughout the Emerald City, in honor of her visitors. The\r\npeople had learned that their old Wizard had returned to them and all\r\nwere anxious to see him again, for he had always been a rare favorite.\r\nSo first there was to be a grand procession through the streets, after\r\nwhich the little old man was requested to perform some of his wizardries\r\nin the great Throne Room of the palace. In the afternoon there were to\r\nbe games and races.\r\n\r\nThe procession was very imposing. First came the Imperial Cornet Band of\r\nOz, dressed in emerald velvet uniforms with slashes of pea-green satin\r\nand buttons of immense cut emeralds. They played the National air\r\ncalled \"The Oz Spangled Banner,\" and behind them were the standard\r\nbearers with the Royal flag. This flag was divided into four quarters,\r\none being colored sky-blue, another pink, a third lavender and a fourth\r\nwhite. In the center was a large emerald-green star, and all over the\r\nfour quarters were sewn spangles that glittered beautifully in the\r\nsunshine. The colors represented the four countries of Oz, and the green\r\nstar the Emerald City.\r\n\r\nJust behind the royal standard-bearers came the Princess Ozma in her\r\nroyal chariot, which was of gold encrusted with emeralds and diamonds\r\nset in exquisite designs. The chariot was drawn on this occasion by the\r\nCowardly Lion and the Hungry Tiger, who were decorated with immense pink\r\nand blue bows. In the chariot rode Ozma and Dorothy, the former in\r\nsplendid raiment and wearing her royal coronet, while the little Kansas\r\ngirl wore around her waist the Magic Belt she had once captured from the\r\nNome King.\r\n\r\nFollowing the chariot came the Scarecrow mounted on the Sawhorse, and\r\nthe people cheered him almost as loudly as they did their lovely Ruler.\r\nBehind him stalked with regular, jerky steps, the famous machine-man\r\ncalled Tik-tok, who had been wound up by Dorothy for the occasion.\r\nTik-tok moved by clockwork, and was made all of burnished copper. He\r\nreally belonged to the Kansas girl, who had much respect for his\r\nthoughts after they had been properly wound and set going; but as the\r\ncopper man would be useless in any place but a fairy country Dorothy had\r\nleft him in charge of Ozma, who saw that he was suitably cared for.\r\n\r\nThere followed another band after this, which was called the Royal Court\r\nBand, because the members all lived in the palace. They wore white\r\nuniforms with real diamond buttons and played \"What is Oz without Ozma\"\r\nvery sweetly.\r\n\r\nThen came Professor Woggle-Bug, with a group of students from the Royal\r\nCollege of Scientific Athletics. The boys wore long hair and striped\r\nsweaters and yelled their college yell every other step they took, to\r\nthe great satisfaction of the populace, which was glad to have this\r\nevidence that their lungs were in good condition.\r\n\r\nThe brilliantly polished Tin Woodman marched next, at the head of the\r\nRoyal Army of Oz which consisted of twenty-eight officers, from Generals\r\ndown to Captains. There were no privates in the army because all were so\r\ncourageous and skillful that they had been promoted one by one until\r\nthere were no privates left. Jim and the buggy followed, the old\r\ncab-horse being driven by Zeb while the Wizard stood up on the seat and\r\nbowed his bald head right and left in answer to the cheers of the\r\npeople, who crowded thick about him.\r\n\r\nTaken altogether the procession was a grand success, and when it had\r\nreturned to the palace the citizens crowded into the great Throne Room\r\nto see the Wizard perform his tricks.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the little humbug did was to produce a tiny white piglet\r\nfrom underneath his hat and pretend to pull it apart, making two. This\r\nact he repeated until all of the nine tiny piglets were visible, and\r\nthey were so glad to get out of his pocket that they ran around in a\r\nvery lively manner. The pretty little creatures would have been a\r\nnovelty anywhere, so the people were as amazed and delighted at their\r\nappearance as even the Wizard could have desired. When he had made them\r\nall disappear again Ozma declared she was sorry they were gone, for she\r\nwanted one of them to pet and play with. So the Wizard pretended to take\r\none of the piglets out of the hair of the Princess (while really he\r\nslyly took it from his inside pocket) and Ozma smiled joyously as the\r\ncreature nestled in her arms, and she promised to have an emerald collar\r\nmade for its fat neck and to keep the little squealer always at hand to\r\namuse her.\r\n\r\nAfterward it was noticed that the Wizard always performed his famous\r\ntrick with eight piglets, but it seemed to please the people just as\r\nwell as if there had been nine of them.\r\n\r\nIn his little room back of the Throne Room the Wizard had found a lot of\r\nthings he had left behind him when he went away in the balloon, for no\r\none had occupied the apartment in his absence. There was enough material\r\nthere to enable him to prepare several new tricks which he had learned\r\nfrom some of the jugglers in the circus, and he had passed part of the\r\nnight in getting them ready. So he followed the trick of the nine tiny\r\npiglets with several other wonderful feats that greatly delighted his\r\naudience and the people did not seem to care a bit whether the little\r\nman was a humbug Wizard or not, so long as he succeeded in amusing them.\r\nThey applauded all his tricks and at the end of the performance begged\r\nhim earnestly not to go away again and leave them.\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said the little man, gravely, \"I will cancel all of my\r\nengagements before the crowned heads of Europe and America and devote\r\nmyself to the people of Oz, for I love you all so well that I can deny\r\nyou nothing.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the people had been dismissed with this promise our friends joined\r\nPrincess Ozma at an elaborate luncheon in the palace, where even the\r\nTiger and the Lion were sumptuously fed and Jim the Cab-horse ate his\r\noatmeal out of a golden bowl with seven rows of rubies, sapphires and\r\ndiamonds set around the rim of it.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon they all went to a great field outside the city gates\r\nwhere the games were to be held. There was a beautiful canopy for Ozma\r\nand her guests to sit under and watch the people run races and jump and\r\nwrestle. You may be sure the folks of Oz did their best with such a\r\ndistinguished company watching them, and finally Zeb offered to wrestle\r\nwith a little Munchkin who seemed to be the champion. In appearance he\r\nwas twice as old as Zeb, for he had long pointed whiskers and wore a\r\npeaked hat with little bells all around the brim of it, which tinkled\r\ngaily as he moved. But although the Munchkin was hardly tall enough to\r\ncome to Zeb's shoulder he was so strong and clever that he laid the boy\r\nthree times on his back with apparent ease.\r\n\r\nZeb was greatly astonished at his defeat, and when the pretty Princess\r\njoined her people in laughing at him he proposed a boxing-match with the\r\nMunchkin, to which the little Ozite readily agreed. But the first time\r\nthat Zeb managed to give him a sharp box on the ears the Munchkin sat\r\ndown upon the ground and cried until the tears ran down his whiskers,\r\nbecause he had been hurt. This made Zeb laugh, in turn, and the boy\r\nfelt comforted to find that Ozma laughed as merrily at her weeping\r\nsubject as she had at him.\r\n\r\nJust then the Scarecrow proposed a race between the Sawhorse and the\r\nCab-horse; and although all the others were delighted at the suggestion\r\nthe Sawhorse drew back, saying:\r\n\r\n\"Such a race would not be fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not,\" added Jim, with a touch of scorn; \"those little wooden\r\nlegs of yours are not half as long as my own.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't that,\" said the Sawhorse, modestly; \"but I never tire, and you\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" cried Jim, looking with great disdain at the other; \"do you\r\nimagine for an instant that such a shabby imitation of a horse as you\r\nare can run as fast as I?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know, I'm sure,\" replied the Sawhorse.\r\n\r\n\"That is what we are trying to find out,\" remarked the Scarecrow. \"The\r\nobject of a race is to see who can win it--or at least that is what my\r\nexcellent brains think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once, when I was young,\" said Jim, \"I was a race horse, and defeated\r\nall who dared run against me. I was born in Kentucky, you know, where\r\nall the best and most aristocratic horses come from.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you're old, now, Jim,\" suggested Zeb.\r\n\r\n\"Old! Why, I feel like a colt today,\" replied Jim. \"I only wish there\r\nwas a real horse here for me to race with. I'd show the people a fine\r\nsight, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why not race with the Sawhorse?\" enquired the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"He's afraid,\" said Jim.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no,\" answered the Sawhorse. \"I merely said it wasn't fair. But if\r\nmy friend the Real Horse is willing to undertake the race I am quite\r\nready.\"\r\n\r\nSo they unharnessed Jim and took the saddle off the Sawhorse, and the\r\ntwo queerly matched animals were stood side by side for the start.\r\n\r\n\"When I say 'Go!'\" Zeb called to them, \"you must dig out and race until\r\nyou reach those three trees you see over yonder. Then circle 'round them\r\nand come back again. The first one that passes the place where the\r\nPrincess sits shall be named the winner. Are you ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I ought to give the wooden dummy a good start of me,\" growled\r\nJim.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that,\" said the Sawhorse. \"I'll do the best I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go!\" cried Zeb; and at the word the two horses leaped forward and the\r\nrace was begun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WIZARD TOOK A PIGLET FROM OZMA'S HAIR.]\r\n\r\nJim's big hoofs pounded away at a great rate, and although he did not\r\nlook very graceful he ran in a way to do credit to his Kentucky\r\nbreeding. But the Sawhorse was swifter than the wind. Its wooden legs\r\nmoved so fast that their twinkling could scarcely be seen, and\r\nalthough so much smaller than the cab-horse it covered the ground much\r\nfaster. Before they had reached the trees the Sawhorse was far ahead,\r\nand the wooden animal returned to the starting place and was being\r\nlustily cheered by the Ozites before Jim came panting up to the canopy\r\nwhere the Princess and her friends were seated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HUNGRY TIGER TEACHES JIM A LESSON.]\r\n\r\nI am sorry to record the fact that Jim was not only ashamed of his\r\ndefeat but for a moment lost control of his temper. As he looked at the\r\ncomical face of the Sawhorse he imagined that the creature was laughing\r\nat him; so in a fit of unreasonable anger he turned around and made a\r\nvicious kick that sent his rival tumbling head over heels upon the\r\nground, and broke off one of its legs and its left ear.\r\n\r\nAn instant later the Tiger crouched and launched its huge body through\r\nthe air swift and resistless as a ball from a cannon. The beast struck\r\nJim full on his shoulder and sent the astonished cab-horse rolling over\r\nand over, amid shouts of delight from the spectators, who had been\r\nhorrified by the ungracious act he had been guilty of.\r\n\r\nWhen Jim came to himself and sat upon his haunches he found the Cowardly\r\nLion crouched on one side of him and the Hungry Tiger on the other, and\r\ntheir eyes were glowing like balls of fire.\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, I'm sure,\" said Jim, meekly. \"I was wrong to kick\r\nthe Sawhorse, and I am sorry I became angry at him. He has won the race,\r\nand won it fairly; but what can a horse of flesh do against a tireless\r\nbeast of wood?\"\r\n\r\nHearing this apology the Tiger and the Lion stopped lashing their tails\r\nand retreated with dignified steps to the side of the Princess.\r\n\r\n\"No one must injure one of our friends in our presence,\" growled the\r\nLion; and Zeb ran to Jim and whispered that unless he controlled his\r\ntemper in the future he would probably be torn to pieces.\r\n\r\nThen the Tin Woodman cut a straight and strong limb from a tree with his\r\ngleaming axe and made a new leg and a new ear for the Sawhorse; and when\r\nthey had been securely fastened in place Princess Ozma took the coronet\r\nfrom her own head and placed it upon that of the winner of the race.\r\nSaid she:\r\n\r\n\"My friend, I reward you for your swiftness by proclaiming you Prince of\r\nHorses, whether of wood or of flesh; and hereafter all other horses--in\r\nthe Land of Oz, at least--must be considered imitations, and you the\r\nreal Champion of your race.\"\r\n\r\nThere was more applause at this, and then Ozma had the jewelled saddle\r\nreplaced upon the Sawhorse and herself rode the victor back to the city\r\nat the head of the grand procession.\r\n\r\n\"I ought to be a fairy,\" grumbled Jim, as he slowly drew the buggy home;\r\n\"for to be just an ordinary horse in a fairy country is to be of no\r\naccount whatever. It's no place for us, Zeb.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's lucky we got here, though,\" said the boy; and Jim thought of the\r\ndark cave, and agreed with him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18.\r\n\r\nTHE TRIAL OF EUREKA THE KITTEN\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral days of festivity and merry-making followed, for such old\r\nfriends did not often meet and there was much to be told and talked over\r\nbetween them, and many amusements to be enjoyed in this delightful\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOzma was happy to have Dorothy beside her, for girls of her own age with\r\nwhom it was proper for the Princess to associate were very few, and\r\noften the youthful Ruler of Oz was lonely for lack of companionship.\r\n\r\nIt was the third morning after Dorothy's arrival, and she was sitting\r\nwith Ozma and their friends in a reception room, talking over old times,\r\nwhen the Princess said to her maid:\r\n\r\n\"Please go to my boudoir, Jellia, and get the white piglet I left on the\r\ndressing-table. I want to play with it.\"\r\n\r\nJellia at once departed on the errand, and she was gone so long that\r\nthey had almost forgotten her mission when the green robed maiden\r\nreturned with a troubled face.\r\n\r\n\"The piglet is not there, your Highness,\" said she.\r\n\r\n\"Not there!\" exclaimed Ozma. \"Are you sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have hunted in every part of the room,\" the maid replied.\r\n\r\n\"Was not the door closed?\" asked the Princess.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, your Highness; I am sure it was; for when I opened it Dorothy's\r\nwhite kitten crept out and ran up the stairs.\"\r\n\r\nHearing this, Dorothy and the Wizard exchanged startled glances, for\r\nthey remembered how often Eureka had longed to eat a piglet. The little\r\ngirl jumped up at once.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Ozma,\" she said, anxiously; \"let us go ourselves to search for\r\nthe piglet.\"\r\n\r\nSo the two went to the dressing-room of the Princess and searched\r\ncarefully in every corner and among the vases and baskets and ornaments\r\nthat stood about the pretty boudoir. But not a trace could they find of\r\nthe tiny creature they sought.\r\n\r\nDorothy was nearly weeping, by this time, while Ozma was angry and\r\nindignant. When they returned to the others the Princess said:\r\n\r\n\"There is little doubt that my pretty piglet has been eaten by that\r\nhorrid kitten, and if that is true the offender must be punished.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't b'lieve Eureka would do such a dreadful thing!\" cried Dorothy,\r\nmuch distressed. \"Go and get my kitten, please, Jellia, and we'll hear\r\nwhat she has to say about it.\"\r\n\r\nThe green maiden hastened away, but presently returned and said:\r\n\r\n\"The kitten will not come. She threatened to scratch my eyes out if I\r\ntouched her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is she?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Under the bed in your own room,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\nSo Dorothy ran to her room and found the kitten under the bed.\r\n\r\n\"Come here, Eureka!\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" answered the kitten, in a surly voice.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Eureka! Why are you so bad?\"\r\n\r\nThe kitten did not reply.\r\n\r\n\"If you don't come to me, right away,\" continued Dorothy, getting\r\nprovoked, \"I'll take my Magic Belt and wish you in the Country of the\r\nGurgles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you want me?\" asked Eureka, disturbed by this threat.\r\n\r\n\"You must go to Princess Ozma. She wants to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" returned the kitten, creeping out. \"I'm not afraid of\r\nOzma--or anyone else.\"\r\n\r\nDorothy carried her in her arms back to where the others sat in grieved\r\nand thoughtful silence.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Eureka,\" said the Princess, gently: \"did you eat my pretty\r\npiglet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't answer such a foolish question,\" asserted Eureka, with a snarl.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes you will, dear,\" Dorothy declared. \"The piglet is gone, and you\r\nran out of the room when Jellia opened the door. So, if you are\r\ninnocent, Eureka, you must tell the Princess how you came to be in her\r\nroom, and what has become of the piglet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who accuses me?\" asked the kitten, defiantly.\r\n\r\n\"No one,\" answered Ozma. \"Your actions alone accuse you. The fact is\r\nthat I left my little pet in my dressing-room lying asleep upon the\r\ntable; and you must hove stolen in without my knowing it. When next the\r\ndoor was opened you ran out and hid yourself--and the piglet was gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's none of my business,\" growled the kitten.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be impudent, Eureka,\" admonished Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"It is you who are impudent,\" said Eureka, \"for accusing me of such a\r\ncrime when you can't prove it except by guessing.\"\r\n\r\nOzma was now greatly incensed by the kitten's conduct. She summoned her\r\nCaptain-General, and when the long, lean officer appeared she said:\r\n\r\n\"Carry this cat away to prison, and keep her in safe confinement until\r\nshe is tried by law for the crime of murder.\"\r\n\r\nSo the Captain-General took Eureka from the arms of the now weeping\r\nDorothy and in spite of the kitten's snarls and scratches carried it\r\naway to prison.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do now?\" asked the Scarecrow, with a sigh, for such a\r\ncrime had cast a gloom over all the company.\r\n\r\n\"I will summon the Court to meet in the Throne Room at three o'clock,\"\r\nreplied Ozma. \"I myself will be the judge, and the kitten shall have a\r\nfair trial.\"\r\n\r\n\"What will happen if she is guilty?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"She must die,\" answered the Princess.\r\n\r\n\"Nine times?\" enquired the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"As many times as is necessary,\" was the reply. \"I will ask the Tin\r\nWoodman to defend the prisoner, because he has such a kind heart I am\r\nsure he will do his best to save her. And the Woggle-Bug shall be the\r\nPublic Accuser, because he is so learned that no one can deceive him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who will be the jury?\" asked the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTRAIT OF THE WIZARD OF OZ.]\r\n\r\n\"There ought to be several animals on the jury,\" said Ozma, \"because\r\nanimals understand each other better than we people understand them.\r\nSo the jury shall consist of the Cowardly Lion, the Hungry Tiger, Jim\r\nthe Cab-horse, the Yellow Hen, the Scarecrow, the Wizard, Tik-tok the\r\nMachine Man, the Sawhorse and Zeb of Hugson's Ranch. That makes the nine\r\nwhich the law requires, and all my people shall be admitted to hear the\r\ntestimony.\"\r\n\r\nThey now separated to prepare for the sad ceremony; for whenever an\r\nappeal is made to law sorrow is almost certain to follow--even in a\r\nfairyland like Oz. But it must be stated that the people of that Land\r\nwere generally so well-behaved that there was not a single lawyer\r\namongst them, and it had been years since any Ruler had sat in judgment\r\nupon an offender of the law. The crime of murder being the most dreadful\r\ncrime of all, tremendous excitement prevailed in the Emerald City when\r\nthe news of Eureka's arrest and trial became known.\r\n\r\nThe Wizard, when he returned to his own room, was exceedingly\r\nthoughtful. He had no doubt Eureka had eaten his piglet, but he realized\r\nthat a kitten cannot be depended upon at all times to act properly,\r\nsince its nature is to destroy small animals and even birds for food,\r\nand the tame cat that we keep in our houses today is descended from the\r\nwild cat of the jungle--a very ferocious creature, indeed. The Wizard\r\nknew that if Dorothy's pet was found guilty and condemned to death the\r\nlittle girl would be made very unhappy; so, although he grieved over the\r\npiglet's sad fate as much as any of them, he resolved to save Eureka's\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nSending for the Tin Woodman the Wizard took him into a corner and\r\nwhispered:\r\n\r\n\"My friend, it is your duty to defend the white kitten and try to save\r\nher, but I fear you will fail because Eureka has long wished to eat a\r\npiglet, to my certain knowledge, and my opinion is that she has been\r\nunable to resist the temptation. Yet her disgrace and death would not\r\nbring back the piglet, but only serve to make Dorothy unhappy. So I\r\nintend to prove the kitten's innocence by a trick.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew from his inside pocket one of the eight tiny piglets that were\r\nremaining and continued:\r\n\r\n\"This creature you must hide in some safe place, and if the jury decides\r\nthat Eureka is guilty you may then produce this piglet and claim it is\r\nthe one that was lost. All the piglets are exactly alike, so no one can\r\ndispute your word. This deception will save Eureka's life, and then we\r\nmay all be happy again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not like to deceive my friends,\" replied the Tin Woodman; \"still,\r\nmy kind heart urges me to save Eureka's life, and I can usually trust my\r\nheart to do the right thing. So I will do as you say, friend Wizard.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some thought he placed the little pig inside his funnel-shaped\r\nhat, and then put the hat upon his head and went back to his room to\r\nthink over his speech to the jury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19.\r\n\r\nTHE WIZARD PERFORMS ANOTHER TRICK\r\n\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock the Throne Room was crowded with citizens, men, women\r\nand children being eager to witness the great trial.\r\n\r\nPrincess Ozma, dressed in her most splendid robes of state, sat in the\r\nmagnificent emerald throne, with her jewelled sceptre in her hand and\r\nher sparkling coronet upon her fair brow. Behind her throne stood the\r\ntwenty-eight officers of her army and many officials of the royal\r\nhousehold. At her right sat the queerly assorted Jury--animals, animated\r\ndummies and people--all gravely prepared to listen to what was said. The\r\nkitten had been placed in a large cage just before the throne, where she\r\nsat upon her haunches and gazed through the bars at the crowds around\r\nher, with seeming unconcern.\r\n\r\nAnd now, at a signal from Ozma, the Woggle-Bug arose and addressed the\r\njury. His tone was pompous and he strutted up and down in an absurd\r\nattempt to appear dignified.\r\n\r\n\"Your Royal Highness and Fellow Citizens,\" he began; \"the small cat you\r\nsee a prisoner before you is accused of the crime of first murdering and\r\nthen eating our esteemed Ruler's fat piglet--or else first eating and\r\nthen murdering it. In either case a grave crime has been committed which\r\ndeserves a grave punishment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean my kitten must be put in a grave?\" asked Dorothy.\r\n\r\n\"Don't interrupt, little girl,\" said the Woggle-Bug. \"When I get my\r\nthoughts arranged in good order I do not like to have anything upset\r\nthem or throw them into confusion.\"\r\n\r\n\"If your thoughts were any good they wouldn't become confused,\" remarked\r\nthe Scarecrow, earnestly. \"My thoughts are always----\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this a trial of thoughts, or of kittens?\" demanded the Woggle-Bug.\r\n\r\n\"It's a trial of one kitten,\" replied the Scarecrow; \"but your manner is\r\na trial to us all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let the Public Accuser continue,\" called Ozma from her throne, \"and I\r\npray you do not interrupt him.\"\r\n\r\n\"The criminal who now sits before the court licking her paws,\" resumed\r\nthe Woggle-Bug, \"has long desired to unlawfully eat the fat piglet,\r\nwhich was no bigger than a mouse. And finally she made a wicked plan to\r\nsatisfy her depraved appetite for pork. I can see her, in my mind's\r\neye----\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"I say I can see her in my mind's eye----\"\r\n\r\n\"The mind has no eye,\" declared the Scarecrow. \"It's blind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your Highness,\" cried the Woggle-Bug, appealing to Ozma, \"have I a\r\nmind's eye, or haven't I?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you have, it is invisible,\" said the Princess.\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" returned the Woggle-Bug, bowing. \"I say I see the criminal,\r\nin my mind's eye, creeping stealthily into the room of our Ozma and\r\nsecreting herself, when no one was looking, until the Princess had gone\r\naway and the door was closed. Then the murderer was alone with her\r\nhelpless victim, the fat piglet, and I see her pounce upon the innocent\r\ncreature and eat it up----\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you still seeing with your mind's eye?\" enquired the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Of course; how else could I see it? And we know the thing is true,\r\nbecause since the time of that interview there is no piglet to be found\r\nanywhere.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EUREKA IN COURT.]\r\n\r\n\"I suppose, if the cat had been gone, instead of the piglet, your mind's\r\neye would see the piglet eating the cat,\" suggested the Scarecrow.\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" acknowledged the Woggle-Bug. \"And now, Fellow Citizens\r\nand Creatures of the Jury, I assert that so awful a crime deserves\r\ndeath, and in the case of the ferocious criminal before you--who is now\r\nwashing her face--the death penalty should be inflicted nine times.\"\r\n\r\nThere was great applause when the speaker sat down. Then the Princess\r\nspoke in a stern voice:\r\n\r\n\"Prisoner, what have you to say for yourself? Are you guilty, or not\r\nguilty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's for you to find out,\" replied Eureka. \"If you can prove I'm\r\nguilty, I'll be willing to die nine times, but a mind's eye is no proof,\r\nbecause the Woggle-Bug has no mind to see with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, dear,\" said Dorothy.\r\n\r\nThen the Tin Woodman arose and said:\r\n\r\n\"Respected Jury and dearly beloved Ozma, I pray you not to judge this\r\nfeline prisoner unfeelingly. I do not think the innocent kitten can be\r\nguilty, and surely it is unkind to accuse a luncheon of being a murder.\r\nEureka is the sweet pet of a lovely little girl whom we all admire, and\r\ngentleness and innocence are her chief virtues. Look at the kitten's\r\nintelligent eyes;\" (here Eureka closed her eyes sleepily) \"gaze at her\r\nsmiling countenance!\" (here Eureka snarled and showed her teeth) \"mark\r\nthe tender pose of her soft, padded little hands!\" (Here Eureka bared\r\nher sharp claws and scratched at the bars of the cage.) \"Would such a\r\ngentle animal be guilty of eating a fellow creature? No; a thousand\r\ntimes, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, cut it short,\" said Eureka; \"you've talked long enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm trying to defend you,\" remonstrated the Tin Woodman.\r\n\r\n\"Then say something sensible,\" retorted the kitten. \"Tell them it would\r\nbe foolish for me to eat the piglet, because I had sense enough to know\r\nit would raise a row if I did. But don't try to make out I'm too\r\ninnocent to eat a fat piglet if I could do it and not be found out. I\r\nimagine it would taste mighty good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it would, to those who eat,\" remarked the Tin Woodman. \"I\r\nmyself, not being built to eat, have no personal experience in such\r\nmatters. But I remember that our great poet once said:\r\n\r\n    \"'To eat is sweet\r\n    When hunger's seat\r\n    Demands a treat\r\n    Of savory meat.'\r\n\r\n\"Take this into consideration, friends of the Jury, and you will readily\r\ndecide that the kitten is wrongfully accused and should be set at\r\nliberty.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Tin Woodman sat down no one applauded him, for his arguments\r\nhad not been very convincing and few believed that he had proved\r\nEureka's innocence. As for the Jury, the members whispered to each other\r\nfor a few minutes and then they appointed the Hungry Tiger their\r\nspokesman. The huge beast slowly arose and said:\r\n\r\n\"Kittens have no consciences, so they eat whatever pleases them. The\r\njury believes the white kitten known as Eureka is guilty of having eaten\r\nthe piglet owned by Princess Ozma, and recommends that she be put to\r\ndeath in punishment of the crime.\"\r\n\r\nThe judgment of the jury was received with great applause, although\r\nDorothy was sobbing miserably at the fate of her pet. The Princess was\r\njust about to order Eureka's head chopped off with the Tin Woodman's axe\r\nwhen that brilliant personage once more arose and addressed her.\r\n\r\n\"Your Highness,\" said he, \"see how easy it is for a jury to be mistaken.\r\nThe kitten could not have eaten your piglet--for here it is!\"\r\n\r\nHe took off his funnel hat and from beneath it produced a tiny white\r\npiglet, which he held aloft that all might see it clearly.\r\n\r\nOzma was delighted and exclaimed, eagerly:\r\n\r\n\"Give me my pet, Nick Chopper!\"\r\n\r\nAnd all the people cheered and clapped their hands, rejoicing that the\r\nprisoner had escaped death and been proved to be innocent.\r\n\r\nAs the Princess held the white piglet in her arms and stroked its soft\r\nhair she said: \"Let Eureka out of the cage, for she is no longer a\r\nprisoner, but our good friend. Where did you find my missing pet, Nick\r\nChopper?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a room of the palace,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Justice,\" remarked the Scarecrow, with a sigh, \"is a dangerous thing to\r\nmeddle with. If you hadn't happened to find the piglet, Eureka would\r\nsurely have been executed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But justice prevailed at the last,\" said Ozma, \"for here is my pet, and\r\nEureka is once more free.\"\r\n\r\n\"I refuse to be free,\" cried the kitten, in a sharp voice, \"unless the\r\nWizard can do his trick with eight piglets. If he can produce but seven,\r\nthen this it not the piglet that was lost, but another one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Eureka!\" warned the Wizard.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be foolish,\" advised the Tin Woodman, \"or you may be sorry for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"The piglet that belonged to the Princess wore an emerald collar,\" said\r\nEureka, loudly enough for all to hear.\r\n\r\n\"So it did!\" exclaimed Ozma. \"This cannot be the one the Wizard gave\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not; he had nine of them, altogether,\" declared Eureka; \"and\r\nI must say it was very stingy of him not to let me eat just a few. But\r\nnow that this foolish trial is ended, I will tell you what really became\r\nof your pet piglet.\"\r\n\r\nAt this everyone in the Throne Room suddenly became quiet, and the\r\nkitten continued, in a calm, mocking tone of voice:\r\n\r\n\"I will confess that I intended to eat the little pig for my breakfast;\r\nso I crept into the room where it was kept while the Princess was\r\ndressing and hid myself under a chair. When Ozma went away she closed\r\nthe door and left her pet on the table. At once I jumped up and told the\r\npiglet not to make a fuss, for he would be inside of me in half a\r\nsecond; but no one can teach one of these creatures to be reasonable.\r\nInstead of keeping still, so I could eat him comfortably, he trembled so\r\nwith fear that he fell off the table into a big vase that was standing\r\non the floor. The vase had a very small neck, and spread out at the top\r\nlike a bowl. At first the piglet stuck in the neck of the vase and I\r\nthought I should get him, after all, but he wriggled himself through and\r\nfell down into the deep bottom part--and I suppose he's there yet.\"\r\n\r\nAll were astonished at this confession, and Ozma at once sent an officer\r\nto her room to fetch the vase. When he returned the Princess looked down\r\nthe narrow neck of the big ornament and discovered her lost piglet, just\r\nas Eureka had said she would.\r\n\r\nThere was no way to get the creature out without breaking the vase, so\r\nthe Tin Woodman smashed it with his axe and set the little prisoner\r\nfree.\r\n\r\nThen the crowd cheered lustily and Dorothy hugged the kitten in her arms\r\nand told her how delighted she was to know that she was innocent.\r\n\r\n\"But why didn't you tell us at first?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"It would have spoiled the fun,\" replied the kitten, yawning.\r\n\r\nOzma gave the Wizard back the piglet he had so kindly allowed Nick\r\nChopper to substitute for the lost one, and then she carried her own\r\ninto the apartments of the palace where she lived. And now, the trial\r\nbeing over, the good citizens of the Emerald City scattered to their\r\nhomes, well content with the day's amusement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20.\r\n\r\nZEB RETURNS TO THE RANCH\r\n\r\n\r\nEureka was much surprised to find herself in disgrace; but she was, in\r\nspite of the fact that she had not eaten the piglet. For the folks of Oz\r\nknew the kitten had tried to commit the crime, and that only an accident\r\nhad prevented her from doing so; therefore even the Hungry Tiger\r\npreferred not to associate with her. Eureka was forbidden to wander\r\naround the palace and was made to stay in confinement in Dorothy's room;\r\nso she began to beg her mistress to send her to some other place where\r\nshe could enjoy herself better.\r\n\r\nDorothy was herself anxious to get home, so she promised Eureka they\r\nwould not stay in the Land of Oz much longer.\r\n\r\nThe next evening after the trial the little girl begged Ozma to allow\r\nher to look in the enchanted picture, and the Princess readily\r\nconsented. She took the child to her room and said: \"Make your wish,\r\ndear, and the picture will show the scene you desire to behold.\"\r\n\r\nThen Dorothy found, with the aid of the enchanted picture, that Uncle\r\nHenry had returned to the farm in Kansas, and she also saw that both he\r\nand Aunt Em were dressed in mourning, because they thought their little\r\nniece had been killed by the earthquake.\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said the girl, anxiously, \"I must get back as soon as poss'ble\r\nto my own folks.\"\r\n\r\nZeb also wanted to see his home, and although he did not find anyone\r\nmourning for him, the sight of Hugson's Ranch in the picture made him\r\nlong to get back there.\r\n\r\n\"This is a fine country, and I like all the people that live in it,\" he\r\ntold Dorothy. \"But the fact is, Jim and I don't seem to fit into a\r\nfairyland, and the old horse has been begging me to go home again ever\r\nsince he lost the race. So, if you can find a way to fix it, we'll be\r\nmuch obliged to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ozma can do it, easily,\" replied Dorothy. \"Tomorrow morning I'll go to\r\nKansas and you can go to Californy.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"I'M MUCH OBLIGED FOR ALL YOUR KINDNESS.\"]\r\n\r\nThat last evening was so delightful that the boy will never forget it as\r\nlong as he lives. They were all together (except Eureka) in the\r\npretty rooms of the Princess, and the Wizard did some new tricks, and\r\nthe Scarecrow told stories, and the Tin Woodman sang a love song in a\r\nsonorous, metallic voice, and everybody laughed and had a good time.\r\nThen Dorothy wound up Tik-tok and he danced a jig to amuse the company,\r\nafter which the Yellow Hen related some of her adventures with the Nome\r\nKing in the Land of Ev.\r\n\r\nThe Princess served delicious refreshments to those who were in the\r\nhabit of eating, and when Dorothy's bed time arrived the company\r\nseparated after exchanging many friendly sentiments.\r\n\r\nNext morning they all assembled for the final parting, and many of the\r\nofficials and courtiers came to look upon the impressive ceremonies.\r\n\r\nDorothy held Eureka in her arms and bade her friends a fond good-bye.\r\n\r\n\"You must come again, some time,\" said the little Wizard; and she\r\npromised she would if she found it possible to do so.\r\n\r\n\"But Uncle Henry and Aunt Em need me to help them,\" she added, \"so I\r\ncan't ever be very long away from the farm in Kansas.\"\r\n\r\nOzma wore the Magic Belt; and, when she had kissed Dorothy farewell and\r\nhad made her wish, the little girl and her kitten disappeared in a\r\ntwinkling.\r\n\r\n\"Where is she?\" asked Zeb, rather bewildered by the suddenness of it.\r\n\r\n\"Greeting her uncle and aunt in Kansas, by this time,\" returned Ozma,\r\nwith a smile.\r\n\r\nThen Zeb brought out Jim, all harnessed to the buggy, and took his seat.\r\n\r\n\"I'm much obliged for all your kindness,\" said the boy, \"and very\r\ngrateful to you for saving my life and sending me home again after all\r\nthe good times I've had. I think this is the loveliest country in the\r\nworld; but not being fairies Jim and I feel we ought to be where we\r\nbelong--and that's at the ranch. Good-bye, everybody!\"\r\n\r\nHe gave a start and rubbed his eyes. Jim was trotting along the\r\nwell-known road, shaking his ears and whisking his tail with a contented\r\nmotion. Just ahead of them were the gates of Hugson's Ranch, and Uncle\r\nHugson now came out and stood with uplifted arms and wide open mouth,\r\nstaring in amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Goodness gracious! It's Zeb--and Jim, too!\" he exclaimed. \"Where in the\r\nworld have you been, my lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, in the world, Uncle,\" answered Zeb, with a laugh.\r\n\r\nThe End\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz, by L.
