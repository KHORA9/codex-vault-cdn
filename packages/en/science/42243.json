  "content": "THE HOUR OF THE DRAGON\r\n\r\n                   By Robert E. Howard\r\n\r\n    [Transcriber's Note: This etext was first published in Weird Tales\r\n    December 1935, January, February, March and April 1936. Extensive\r\n    research did not uncover any evidence that the U.S. copyright on\r\n    this publication was renewed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\nO Sleeper, Awake!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long tapers flickered, sending the black shadows wavering along the\r\nwalls, and the velvet tapestries rippled. Yet there was no wind in the\r\nchamber. Four men stood about the ebony table on which lay the green\r\nsarcophagus that gleamed like carven jade. In the upraised right hand of\r\neach man a curious black candle burned with a weird greenish light.\r\nOutside was night and a lost wind moaning among the black trees.\r\n\r\nInside the chamber was tense silence, and the wavering of the shadows,\r\nwhile four pairs of eyes, burning with intensity, were fixed on the long\r\ngreen case across which cryptic hieroglyphics writhed, as if lent life\r\nand movement by the unsteady light. The man at the foot of the\r\nsarcophagus leaned over it and moved his candle as if he were writing\r\nwith a pen, inscribing a mystic symbol in the air. Then he set down the\r\ncandle in its black gold stick at the foot of the case, and, mumbling\r\nsome formula unintelligible to his companions, he thrust a broad white\r\nhand into his fur-trimmed robe. When he brought it forth again it was as\r\nif he cupped in his palm a ball of living fire.\r\n\r\nThe other three drew in their breath sharply, and the dark, powerful man\r\nwho stood at the head of the sarcophagus whispered: 'The Heart of\r\nAhriman!' The other lifted a quick hand for silence. Somewhere a dog\r\nbegan howling dolefully, and a stealthy step padded outside the barred\r\nand bolted door. But none looked aside from the mummy-case over which\r\nthe man in the ermine-trimmed robe was now moving the great flaming\r\njewel while he muttered an incantation that was old when Atlantis sank.\r\nThe glare of the gem dazzled their eyes, so that they could not be sure\r\nof what they saw; but with a splintering crash, the carven lid of the\r\nsarcophagus burst outward as if from some irresistible pressure applied\r\nfrom within, and the four men, bending eagerly forward, saw the\r\noccupant--a huddled, withered, wizened shape, with dried brown limbs\r\nlike dead wood showing through moldering bandages.\r\n\r\n'Bring that thing _back_?' muttered the small dark man who stood on the\r\nright, with a short sardonic laugh. 'It is ready to crumble at a touch.\r\nWe are fools--'\r\n\r\n'Shhh!' It was an urgent hiss of command from the large man who held the\r\njewel. Perspiration stood upon his broad white forehead and his eyes\r\nwere dilated. He leaned forward, and, without touching the thing with\r\nhis hand, laid on the breast of the mummy the blazing jewel. Then he\r\ndrew back and watched with fierce intensity, his lips moving in\r\nsoundless invocation.\r\n\r\nIt was as if a globe of living fire flickered and burned on the dead,\r\nwithered bosom. And breath sucked in, hissing, through the clenched\r\nteeth of the watchers. For as they watched, an awful transmutation\r\nbecame apparent. The withered shape in the sarcophagus was expanding,\r\nwas growing, lengthening. The bandages burst and fell into brown dust.\r\nThe shriveled limbs swelled, straightened. Their dusky hue began to\r\nfade.\r\n\r\n'By Mitra!' whispered the tall, yellow-haired man on the left. 'He was\r\n_not_ a Stygian. That part at least was true.'\r\n\r\nAgain a trembling finger warned for silence. The hound outside was no\r\nlonger howling. He whimpered, as with an evil dream, and then that\r\nsound, too, died away in silence, in which the yellow-haired man plainly\r\nheard the straining of the heavy door, as if something outside pushed\r\npowerfully upon it. He half turned, his hand at his sword, but the man\r\nin the ermine robe hissed an urgent warning: 'Stay! Do not break the\r\nchain! And on your life do not go to the door!'\r\n\r\nThe yellow-haired man shrugged and turned back, and then he stopped\r\nshort, staring. In the jade sarcophagus lay a living man: a tall, lusty\r\nman, naked, white of skin, and dark of hair and beard. He lay\r\nmotionless, his eyes wide open, and blank and unknowing as a newborn\r\nbabe's. On his breast the great jewel smoldered and sparkled.\r\n\r\nThe man in ermine reeled as if from some let-down of extreme tension.\r\n\r\n'Ishtar!' he gasped. 'It is Xaltotun!--_and he lives!_ Valerius!\r\nTarascus! Amalric! Do you see? Do you see? You doubted me--but I have\r\nnot failed! We have been close to the open gates of hell this night, and\r\nthe shapes of darkness have gathered close about us--aye, they followed\r\n_him_ to the very door--but we have brought the great magician back to\r\nlife.'\r\n\r\n'And damned our souls to purgatories everlasting, I doubt not,' muttered\r\nthe small, dark man, Tarascus.\r\n\r\nThe yellow-haired man, Valerius, laughed harshly.\r\n\r\n'What purgatory can be worse than life itself? So we are all damned\r\ntogether from birth. Besides, who would not sell his miserable soul for\r\na throne?'\r\n\r\n'There is no intelligence in his stare, Orastes,' said the large man.\r\n\r\n'He has long been dead,' answered Orastes. 'He is as one newly awakened.\r\nHis mind is empty after the long sleep--nay, he was _dead_, not\r\nsleeping. We brought his spirit back over the voids and gulfs of night\r\nand oblivion. I will speak to him.'\r\n\r\nHe bent over the foot of the sarcophagus, and fixing his gaze on the\r\nwide dark eyes of the man within, he said, slowly: 'Awake, Xaltotun!'\r\n\r\nThe lips of the man moved mechanically. 'Xaltotun!' he repeated in a\r\ngroping whisper.\r\n\r\n'_You_ are Xaltotun!' exclaimed Orastes, like a hypnotist driving home\r\nhis suggestions. 'You are Xaltotun of Python, in Acheron.'\r\n\r\nA dim flame flickered in the dark eyes.\r\n\r\n'I was Xaltotun,' he whispered. 'I am dead.'\r\n\r\n'You _are_ Xaltotun!' cried Orastes. 'You are not dead! You live!'\r\n\r\n'I am Xaltotun,' came the eery whisper. 'But I am dead. In my house in\r\nKhemi, in Stygia, there I died.'\r\n\r\n'And the priests who poisoned you mummified your body with their dark\r\narts, keeping all your organs intact!' exclaimed Orastes. 'But now you\r\nlive again! The Heart of Ahriman has restored your life, drawn your\r\nspirit back from space and eternity.'\r\n\r\n'The Heart of Ahriman!' The flame of remembrance grew stronger. 'The\r\nbarbarians stole it from me!'\r\n\r\n'He remembers,' muttered Orastes. 'Lift him from the case.'\r\n\r\nThe others obeyed hesitantly, as if reluctant to touch the man they had\r\nrecreated, and they seemed not easier in their minds when they felt firm\r\nmuscular flesh, vibrant with blood and life, beneath their fingers. But\r\nthey lifted him upon the table, and Orastes clothed him in a curious\r\ndark velvet robe, splashed with gold stars and crescent moons, and\r\nfastened a cloth-of-gold fillet about his temples, confining the black\r\nwavy locks that fell to his shoulders. He let them do as they would,\r\nsaying nothing, not even when they set him in a carven throne-like chair\r\nwith a high ebony back and wide silver arms, and feet like golden claws.\r\nHe sat there motionless, and slowly intelligence grew in his dark eyes\r\nand made them deep and strange and luminous. It was as if long-sunken\r\nwitchlights floated slowly up through midnight pools of darkness.\r\n\r\nOrastes cast a furtive glance at his companions, who stood staring in\r\nmorbid fascination at their strange guest. Their iron nerves had\r\nwithstood an ordeal that might have driven weaker men mad. He knew it\r\nwas with no weaklings that he conspired, but men whose courage was as\r\nprofound as their lawless ambitions and capacity for evil. He turned his\r\nattention to the figure in the ebon-black chair. And this one spoke at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n'I remember,' he said in a strong, resonant voice, speaking Nemedian\r\nwith a curious, archaic accent. 'I am Xaltotun, who was high priest of\r\nSet in Python, which was in Acheron. The Heart of Ahriman--I dreamed I\r\nhad found it again--where is it?'\r\n\r\nOrastes placed it in his hand, and he drew breath deeply as he gazed\r\ninto the depths of the terrible jewel burning in his grasp.\r\n\r\n'They stole it from me, long ago,' he said. 'The red heart of the night\r\nit is, strong to save or to damn. It came from afar, and from long ago.\r\nWhile I held it, none could stand before me. But it was stolen from me,\r\nand Acheron fell, and I fled in exile into dark Stygia. Much I remember,\r\nbut much I have forgotten. I have been in a far land, across misty voids\r\nand gulfs and unlit oceans. What is the year?'\r\n\r\nOrastes answered him. 'It is the waning of the Year of the Lion, three\r\nthousand years after the fall of Acheron.'\r\n\r\n'Three thousand years!' murmured the other. 'So long? Who are you?'\r\n\r\n'I am Orastes, once a priest of Mitra. This man is Amalric, baron of\r\nTor, in Nemedia; this other is Tarascus, younger brother of the king of\r\nNemedia; and this tall man is Valerius, rightful heir of the throne of\r\nAquilonia.'\r\n\r\n'Why have you given me life?' demanded Xaltotun. 'What do you require of\r\nme?'\r\n\r\nThe man was now fully alive and awake, his keen eyes reflecting the\r\nworking of an unclouded brain. There was no hesitation or uncertainty in\r\nhis manner. He came directly to the point, as one who knows that no man\r\ngives something for nothing. Orastes met him with equal candor.\r\n\r\n'We have opened the doors of hell this night to free your soul and\r\nreturn it to your body because we need your aid. We wish to place\r\nTarascus on the throne of Nemedia, and to win for Valerius the crown of\r\nAquilonia. With your necromancy you can aid us.'\r\n\r\nXaltotun's mind was devious and full of unexpected slants.\r\n\r\n'You must be deep in the arts yourself, Orastes, to have been able to\r\nrestore my life. How is it that a priest of Mitra knows of the Heart of\r\nAhriman, and the incantations of Skelos?'\r\n\r\n'I am no longer a priest of Mitra,' answered Orastes. 'I was cast forth\r\nfrom my order because of my delving in black magic. But for Amalric\r\nthere I might have been burned as a magician.\r\n\r\n'But that left me free to pursue my studies. I journeyed in Zamora, in\r\nVendhya, in Stygia, and among the haunted jungles of Khitai. I read the\r\niron-bound books of Skelos, and talked with unseen creatures in deep\r\nwells, and faceless shapes in black reeking jungles. I obtained a\r\nglimpse of your sarcophagus in the demon-haunted crypts below the black\r\ngiant-walled temple of Set in the hinterlands of Stygia, and I learned\r\nof the arts that would bring back life to your shriveled corpse. From\r\nmoldering manuscripts I learned of the Heart of Ahriman. Then for a year\r\nI sought its hiding-place, and at last I found it.'\r\n\r\n'Then why trouble to bring me back to life?' demanded Xaltotun, with his\r\npiercing gaze fixed on the priest. 'Why did you not employ the Heart to\r\nfurther your own power?'\r\n\r\n'Because no man today knows the secrets of the Heart,' answered Orastes.\r\n'Not even in legends live the arts by which to loose its full powers. I\r\nknew it could restore life; of its deeper secrets I am ignorant. I\r\nmerely used it to bring you back to life. It is the use of your\r\nknowledge we seek. As for the Heart, you alone know its awful secrets.'\r\n\r\nXaltotun shook his head, staring broodingly into the flaming depths.\r\n\r\n'My necromantic knowledge is greater than the sum of all the knowledge\r\nof other men,' he said; 'yet I do not know the full power of the jewel.\r\nI did not invoke it in the old days; I guarded it lest it be used\r\nagainst me. At last it was stolen, and in the hands of a feathered\r\nshaman of the barbarians it defeated all my mighty sorcery. Then it\r\nvanished, and I was poisoned by the jealous priests of Stygia before I\r\ncould learn where it was hidden.'\r\n\r\n'It was hidden in a cavern below the temple of Mitra, in Tarantia,' said\r\nOrastes. 'By devious ways I discovered this, after I had located your\r\nremains in Set's subterranean temple in Stygia.\r\n\r\n'Zamorian thieves, partly protected by spells I learned from sources\r\nbetter left unmentioned, stole your mummy-case from under the very\r\ntalons of those which guarded it in the dark, and by camel-caravan and\r\ngalley and ox-wagon it came at last to this city.\r\n\r\n'Those same thieves--or rather those of them who still lived after their\r\nfrightful quest--stole the Heart of Ahriman from its haunted cavern\r\nbelow the temple of Mitra, and all the skill of men and the spells of\r\nsorcerers nearly failed. One man of them lived long enough to reach me\r\nand give the jewel into my hands, before he died slavering and gibbering\r\nof what he had seen in that accursed crypt. The thieves of Zamora are\r\nthe most faithful of men to their trust. Even with my conjurements, none\r\nbut they could have stolen the Heart from where it has lain in\r\ndemon-guarded darkness since the fall of Acheron, three thousand years\r\nago.'\r\n\r\nXaltotun lifted his lion-like head and stared far off into space, as if\r\nplumbing the lost centuries.\r\n\r\n'Three thousand years!' he muttered. 'Set! Tell me what has chanced in\r\nthe world.'\r\n\r\n'The barbarians who overthrew Acheron set up new kingdoms,' quoted\r\nOrastes. 'Where the empire had stretched now rose realms called\r\nAquilonia, and Nemedia, and Argos, from the tribes that founded them.\r\nThe older kingdoms of Ophir, Corinthia and western Koth, which had been\r\nsubject to the kings of Acheron, regained their independence with the\r\nfall of the empire.'\r\n\r\n'And what of the people of Acheron?' demanded Xaltotun. 'When I fled\r\ninto Stygia, Python was in ruins, and all the great, purple-towered\r\ncities of Acheron fouled with blood and trampled by the sandals of the\r\nbarbarians.'\r\n\r\n'In the hills small groups of folk still boast descent from Acheron,'\r\nanswered Orastes. 'For the rest, the tide of my barbarian ancestors\r\nrolled over them and wiped them out. They--my ancestors--had suffered\r\nmuch from the kings of Acheron.'\r\n\r\nA grim and terrible smile curled the Pythonian's lips.\r\n\r\n'Aye! Many a barbarian, both man and woman, died screaming on the altar\r\nunder this hand. I have seen their heads piled to make a pyramid in the\r\ngreat square in Python when the kings returned from the west with their\r\nspoils and naked captives.'\r\n\r\n'Aye. And when the day of reckoning came, the sword was not spared. So\r\nAcheron ceased to be, and purple-towered Python became a memory of\r\nforgotten days. But the younger kingdoms rose on the imperial ruins and\r\nwaxed great. And now we have brought you back to aid us to rule these\r\nkingdoms, which, if less strange and wonderful than Acheron of old, are\r\nyet rich and powerful, well worth fighting for. Look!' Orastes unrolled\r\nbefore the stranger a map drawn cunningly on vellum.\r\n\r\nXaltotun regarded it, and then shook his head, baffled.\r\n\r\n'The very outlines of the land are changed. It is like some familiar\r\nthing seen in a dream, fantastically distorted.'\r\n\r\n'Howbeit,' answered Orastes, tracing with his forefinger, 'here is\r\nBelverus, the capital of Nemedia, in which we now are. Here run the\r\nboundaries of the land of Nemedia. To the south and southeast are Ophir\r\nand Corinthia, to the east Brythunia, to the west Aquilonia.'\r\n\r\n'It is the map of a world I do not know,' said Xaltotun softly, but\r\nOrastes did not miss the lurid fire of hate that flickered in his dark\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n'It is a map you shall help us change,' answered Orastes. 'It is our\r\ndesire first to set Tarascus on the throne of Nemedia. We wish to\r\naccomplish this without strife, and in such a way that no suspicion will\r\nrest on Tarascus. We do not wish the land to be torn by civil wars, but\r\nto reserve all our power for the conquest of Aquilonia.\r\n\r\n'Should King Nimed and his sons die naturally, in a plague for instance,\r\nTarascus would mount the throne as the next heir, peacefully and\r\nunopposed.'\r\n\r\nXaltotun nodded, without replying, and Orastes continued.\r\n\r\n'The other task will be more difficult. We cannot set Valerius on the\r\nAquilonian throne without a war, and that kingdom is a formidable foe.\r\nIts people are a hardy, war-like race, toughened by continual wars with\r\nthe Picts, Zingarians and Cimmerians. For five hundred years Aquilonia\r\nand Nemedia have intermittently waged war, and the ultimate advantage\r\nhas always lain with the Aquilonians.\r\n\r\n'Their present king is the most renowned warrior among the western\r\nnations. He is an outlander, an adventurer who seized the crown by force\r\nduring a time of civil strife, strangling King Namedides with his own\r\nhands, upon the very throne. His name is Conan, and no man can stand\r\nbefore him in battle.\r\n\r\n'Valerius is now the rightful heir of the throne. He had been driven\r\ninto exile by his royal kinsman, Namedides, and has been away from his\r\nnative realm for years, but he is of the blood of the old dynasty, and\r\nmany of the barons would secretly hail the overthrow of Conan, who is a\r\nnobody without royal or even noble blood. But the common people are\r\nloyal to him, and the nobility of the outlying provinces. Yet if his\r\nforces were overthrown in the battle that must first take place, and\r\nConan himself slain, I think it would not be difficult to put Valerius\r\non the throne. Indeed, with Conan slain, the only center of the\r\ngovernment would be gone. He is not part of a dynasty, but only a lone\r\nadventurer.'\r\n\r\n'I wish that I might see this king,' mused Xaltotun, glancing toward a\r\nsilvery mirror which formed one of the panels of the wall. This mirror\r\ncast no reflection, but Xaltotun's expression showed that he understood\r\nits purpose, and Orastes nodded with the pride a good craftsman takes in\r\nthe recognition of his accomplishments by a master of his craft.\r\n\r\n'I will try to show him to you,' he said. And seating himself before the\r\nmirror, he gazed hypnotically into its depths, where presently a dim\r\nshadow began to take shape.\r\n\r\nIt was uncanny, but those watching knew it was no more than the\r\nreflected image of Orastes' thought, embodied in that mirror as a\r\nwizard's thoughts are embodied in a magic crystal. It floated hazily,\r\nthen leaped into startling clarity--a tall man, mightily shouldered and\r\ndeep of chest, with a massive corded neck and heavily muscled limbs. He\r\nwas clad in silk and velvet, with the royal lions of Aquilonia worked\r\nin gold upon his rich jupon, and the crown of Aquilonia shone on his\r\nsquare-cut black mane; but the great sword at his side seemed more\r\nnatural to him than the regal accouterments. His brow was low and broad,\r\nhis eyes a volcanic blue that smoldered as if with some inner fire. His\r\ndark, scarred, almost sinister face was that of a fighting-man, and his\r\nvelvet garments could not conceal the hard, dangerous lines of his\r\nlimbs.\r\n\r\n'That man is no Hyborian!' exclaimed Xaltotun.\r\n\r\n'No; he is a Cimmerian, one of those wild tribesmen who dwell in the\r\ngray hills of the north.'\r\n\r\n'I fought his ancestors of old,' muttered Xaltotun. 'Not even the kings\r\nof Acheron could conquer them.'\r\n\r\n'They still remain a terror to the nations of the south,' answered\r\nOrastes. 'He is a true son of that savage race, and has proved himself,\r\nthus far, unconquerable.'\r\n\r\nXaltotun did not reply; he sat staring down at the pool of living fire\r\nthat shimmered in his hand. Outside, the hound howled again, long and\r\nshudderingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\nA Black Wind Blows\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year of the dragon had birth in war and pestilence and unrest. The\r\nblack plague stalked through the streets of Belverus, striking down the\r\nmerchant in his stall, the serf in his kennel, the knight at his banquet\r\nboard. Before it the arts of the leeches were helpless. Men said it had\r\nbeen sent from hell as punishment for the sins of pride and lust. It was\r\nswift and deadly as the stroke of an adder. The victim's body turned\r\npurple and then black, and within a few minutes he sank down dying, and\r\nthe stench of his own putrefaction was in his nostrils even before death\r\nwrenched his soul from his rotting body. A hot, roaring wind blew\r\nincessantly from the south, and the crops withered in the fields, the\r\ncattle sank and died in their tracks.\r\n\r\nMen cried out on Mitra, and muttered against the king; for somehow,\r\nthroughout the kingdom, the word was whispered that the king was\r\nsecretly addicted to loathsome practises and foul debauches in the\r\nseclusion of his nighted palace. And then in that palace death stalked\r\ngrinning on feet about which swirled the monstrous vapors of the plague.\r\nIn one night the king died with his three sons, and the drums that\r\nthundered their dirge drowned the grim and ominous bells that rang from\r\nthe carts that lumbered through the streets gathering up the rotting\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThat night, just before dawn, the hot wind that had blown for weeks\r\nceased to rustle evilly through the silken window curtains. Out of the\r\nnorth rose a great wind that roared among the towers, and there was\r\ncataclysmic thunder, and blinding sheets of lightning, and driving rain.\r\nBut the dawn shone clean and green and clear; the scorched ground veiled\r\nitself in grass, the thirsty crops sprang up anew, and the plague was\r\ngone--its miasma swept clean out of the land by the mighty wind.\r\n\r\nMen said the gods were satisfied because the evil king and his spawn\r\nwere slain, and when his young brother Tarascus was crowned in the great\r\ncoronation hall, the populace cheered until the towers rocked,\r\nacclaiming the monarch on whom the gods smiled.\r\n\r\nSuch a wave of enthusiasm and rejoicing as swept the land is frequently\r\nthe signal for a war of conquest. So no one was surprised when it was\r\nannounced that King Tarascus had declared the truce made by the late\r\nking with their western neighbors void, and was gathering his hosts to\r\ninvade Aquilonia. His reason was candid; his motives, loudly proclaimed,\r\ngilded his actions with something of the glamor of a crusade. He\r\nespoused the cause of Valerius, 'rightful heir to the throne'; he came,\r\nhe proclaimed, not as an enemy of Aquilonia, but as a friend, to free\r\nthe people from the tyranny of a usurper and a foreigner.\r\n\r\nIf there were cynical smiles in certain quarters, and whispers\r\nconcerning the king's good friend Amalric, whose vast personal wealth\r\nseemed to be flowing into the rather depleted royal treasury, they were\r\nunheeded in the general wave of fervor and zeal of Tarascus' popularity.\r\nIf any shrewd individuals suspected that Amalric was the real ruler of\r\nNemedia, behind the scenes, they were careful not to voice such heresy.\r\nAnd the war went forward with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThe king and his allies moved westward at the head of fifty thousand\r\nmen--knights in shining armor with their pennons streaming above their\r\nhelmets, pikemen in steel caps and brigandines, cross-bowmen in leather\r\njerkins. They crossed the border, took a frontier castle and burned\r\nthree mountain villages, and then, in the valley of the Valkia, ten\r\nmiles west of the boundary line, they met the hosts of Conan, king of\r\nAquilonia--forty-five thousand knights, archers and men-at-arms, the\r\nflower of Aquilonian strength and chivalry. Only the knights of Poitain,\r\nunder Prospero, had not yet arrived, for they had far to ride up from\r\nthe southwestern corner of the kingdom. Tarascus had struck without\r\nwarning. His invasion had come on the heels of his proclamation, without\r\nformal declaration of war.\r\n\r\nThe two hosts confronted each other across a wide, shallow valley, with\r\nrugged cliffs, and a shallow stream winding through masses of reeds and\r\nwillows down the middle of the vale. The camp-followers of both hosts\r\ncame down to this stream for water, and shouted insults and hurled\r\nstones across at one another. The last glints of the sun shone on the\r\ngolden banner of Nemedia with the scarlet dragon, unfurled in the breeze\r\nabove the pavilion of King Tarascus on an eminence near the eastern\r\ncliffs. But the shadow of the western cliffs fell like a vast purple\r\npall across the tents and the army of Aquilonia, and upon the black\r\nbanner with its golden lion that floated above King Conan's pavilion.\r\n\r\nAll night the fires flared the length of the valley, and the wind\r\nbrought the call of trumpets, the clangor of arms, and the sharp\r\nchallenges of the sentries who paced their horses along either edge of\r\nthe willow-grown stream.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was in the darkness before dawn that King Conan stirred on his couch,\r\nwhich was no more than a pile of silks and furs thrown on a dais, and\r\nawakened. He started up, crying out sharply and clutching at his sword.\r\nPallantides, his commander, rushing in at the cry, saw his king sitting\r\nupright, his hand on his hilt, and perspiration dripping from his\r\nstrangely pale face.\r\n\r\n'Your Majesty!' exclaimed Pallantides. 'Is aught amiss?'\r\n\r\n'What of the camp?' demanded Conan. 'Are the guards out?'\r\n\r\n'Five hundred horsemen patrol the stream, your Majesty,' answered the\r\ngeneral. 'The Nemedians have not offered to move against us in the\r\nnight. They wait for dawn, even as we.'\r\n\r\n'By Crom,' muttered Conan. 'I awoke with a feeling that doom was\r\ncreeping on me in the night.'\r\n\r\nHe stared up at the great golden lamp which shed a soft glow over the\r\nvelvet hangings and carpets of the great tent. They were alone; not even\r\na slave or a page slept on the carpeted floor; but Conan's eyes blazed\r\nas they were wont to blaze in the teeth of great peril, and the sword\r\nquivered in his hand. Pallantides watched him uneasily. Conan seemed to\r\nbe listening.\r\n\r\n'Listen!' hissed the king. 'Did you hear it? A furtive step!'\r\n\r\n'Seven knights guard your tent, your Majesty,' said Pallantides. 'None\r\ncould approach it unchallenged.'\r\n\r\n'Not outside,' growled Conan. 'It seemed to sound inside the tent.'\r\n\r\nPallantides cast a swift, startled look around. The velvet hangings\r\nmerged with shadows in the corners, but if there had been anyone in the\r\npavilion besides themselves, the general would have seen him. Again he\r\nshook his head.\r\n\r\n'There is no one here, sire. You sleep in the midst of your host.'\r\n\r\n'I have seen death strike a king in the midst of thousands,' muttered\r\nConan. 'Something that walks on invisible feet and is not seen--'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps you were dreaming, your Majesty,' said Pallantides, somewhat\r\nperturbed.\r\n\r\n'So I was,' grunted Conan. 'A devilish dream it was, too. I trod again\r\nall the long, weary roads I traveled on my way to the kingship.'\r\n\r\nHe fell silent, and Pallantides stared at him unspeaking. The king was\r\nan enigma to the general, as to most of his civilized subjects.\r\nPallantides knew that Conan had walked many strange roads in his wild,\r\neventful life, and had been many things before a twist of Fate set him\r\non the throne of Aquilonia.\r\n\r\n'I saw again the battlefield whereon I was born,' said Conan, resting\r\nhis chin moodily on a massive fist. 'I saw myself in a pantherskin\r\nloin-cloth, throwing my spear at the mountain beasts. I was a mercenary\r\nswordsman again, a hetman of the _kozaki_ who dwell along the Zaporoska\r\nRiver, a corsair looting the coasts of Kush, a pirate of the Barachan\r\nIsles, a chief of the Himelian hillmen. All these things I've been, and\r\nof all these things I dreamed; all the shapes that have been I passed\r\nlike an endless procession, and their feet beat out a dirge in the\r\nsounding dust.\r\n\r\n'But throughout my dreams moved strange, veiled figures and ghostly\r\nshadows, and a faraway voice mocked me. And toward the last I seemed to\r\nsee myself lying on this dais in my tent, and a shape bent over me,\r\nrobed and hooded. I lay unable to move, and then the hood fell away and\r\na moldering skull grinned down at me. Then it was that I awoke.'\r\n\r\n'This is an evil dream, your Majesty,' said Pallantides, suppressing a\r\nshudder. 'But no more.'\r\n\r\nConan shook his head, more in doubt than in denial. He came of a\r\nbarbaric race, and the superstitions and instincts of his heritage\r\nlurked close beneath the surface of his consciousness.\r\n\r\n'I've dreamed many evil dreams,' he said, 'and most of them were\r\nmeaningless. But by Crom, this was not like most dreams! I wish this\r\nbattle were fought and won, for I've had a grisly premonition ever since\r\nKing Nimed died in the black plague. Why did it cease when he died?'\r\n\r\n'Men say he sinned--'\r\n\r\n'Men are fools, as always,' grunted Conan. 'If the plague struck all who\r\nsinned, then by Crom there wouldn't be enough left to count the living!\r\nWhy should the gods--who the priests tell me are just--slay five hundred\r\npeasants and merchants and nobles before they slew the king, if the\r\nwhole pestilence were aimed at him? Were the gods smiting blindly, like\r\nswordsmen in a fog? By Mitra, if I aimed my strokes no straighter,\r\nAquilonia would have had a new king long ago.\r\n\r\n'No! The black plague's no common pestilence. It lurks in Stygian\r\ntombs, and is called forth into being only by wizards. I was a swordsman\r\nin Prince Almuric's army that invaded Stygia, and of his thirty\r\nthousand, fifteen thousand perished by Stygian arrows, and the rest by\r\nthe black plague that rolled on us like a wind out of the south. I was\r\nthe only man who lived.'\r\n\r\n'Yet only five hundred died in Nemedia,' argued Pallantides.\r\n\r\n'Whoever called it into being knew how to cut it short at will,'\r\nanswered Conan. 'So I know there was something planned and diabolical\r\nabout it. Someone called it forth, someone banished it when the work was\r\ncompleted--when Tarascus was safe on the throne and being hailed as the\r\ndeliverer of the people from the wrath of the gods. By Crom, I sense a\r\nblack, subtle brain behind all this. What of this stranger who men say\r\ngives counsel to Tarascus?'\r\n\r\n'He wears a veil,' answered Pallantides; 'they say he is a foreigner; a\r\nstranger from Stygia.'\r\n\r\n'A stranger from Stygia!' repeated Conan scowling. 'A stranger from\r\nhell, more like!--Ha! What is that?'\r\n\r\n'The trumpets of the Nemedians!' exclaimed Pallantides. 'And hark, how\r\nour own blare upon their heels! Dawn is breaking, and the captains are\r\nmarshaling the hosts for the onset! Mitra be with them, for many will\r\nnot see the sun go down behind the crags.'\r\n\r\n'Send my squires to me!' exclaimed Conan, rising with alacrity and\r\ncasting off his velvet night-garment; he seemed to have forgotten his\r\nforebodings at the prospect of action. 'Go to the captains and see that\r\nall is in readiness. I will be with you as soon as I don my armor.'\r\n\r\nMany of Conan's ways were inexplicable to the civilized people he ruled,\r\nand one of them was his insistence on sleeping alone in his chamber or\r\ntent. Pallantides hastened from the pavilion, clanking in the armor he\r\nhad donned at midnight after a few hours' sleep. He cast a swift glance\r\nover the camp, which was beginning to swarm with activity, mail clinking\r\nand men moving about dimly in the uncertain light, among the long lines\r\nof tents. Stars still glimmered palely in the western sky, but long pink\r\nstreamers stretched along the eastern horizon, and against them the\r\ndragon banner of Nemedia flung out its billowing silken folds.\r\n\r\nPallantides turned toward a smaller tent near by, where slept the royal\r\nsquires. These were tumbling out already, roused by the trumpets. And as\r\nPallantides called to them to hasten, he was frozen speechless by a deep\r\nfierce shout and the impact of a heavy blow inside the king's tent,\r\nfollowed by the heart-stopping crash of a falling body. There sounded a\r\nlow laugh that turned the general's blood to ice.\r\n\r\nEchoing the cry, Pallantides wheeled and rushed back into the pavilion.\r\nHe cried out again as he saw Conan's powerful frame stretched out on\r\nthe carpet. The king's great two-handed sword lay near his hand, and a\r\nshattered tent-pole seemed to show where his stroke had fallen.\r\nPallantides' sword was out, and he glared about the tent, but nothing\r\nmet his gaze. Save for the king and himself it was empty, as it had been\r\nwhen he left it.\r\n\r\n'Your Majesty!' Pallantides threw himself on his knee beside the fallen\r\ngiant.\r\n\r\nConan's eyes were open; they blazed up at him with full intelligence and\r\nrecognition. His lips writhed, but no sound came forth. He seemed unable\r\nto move.\r\n\r\nVoices sounded without. Pallantides rose swiftly and stepped to the\r\ndoor. The royal squires and one of the knights who guarded the tent\r\nstood there.\r\n\r\n'We heard a sound within,' said the knight apologetically. 'Is all well\r\nwith the king?'\r\n\r\nPallantides regarded him searchingly.\r\n\r\n'None has entered or left the pavilion this night?'\r\n\r\n'None save yourself, my lord,' answered the knight, and Pallantides\r\ncould not doubt his honesty.\r\n\r\n'The king stumbled and dropped his sword,' said Pallantides briefly.\r\n'Return to your post.'\r\n\r\nAs the knight turned away, the general covertly motioned to the five\r\nroyal squires, and when they had followed him in, he drew the flap\r\nclosely. They turned pale at the sight of the king stretched upon the\r\ncarpet, but Pallantides' quick gesture checked their exclamations.\r\n\r\nThe general bent over him again, and again Conan made an effort to\r\nspeak. The veins in his temples and the cords in his neck swelled with\r\nhis efforts, and he lifted his head clear of the ground. Voice came at\r\nlast, mumbling and half intelligible.\r\n\r\n'_The thing--the thing in the corner!_'\r\n\r\nPallantides lifted his head and looked fearfully about him. He saw the\r\npale faces of the squires in the lamplight, the velvet shadows that\r\nlurked along the walls of the pavilion. That was all.\r\n\r\n'There is nothing here, your Majesty,' he said.\r\n\r\n'It was there, in the corner,' muttered the king, tossing his lion-maned\r\nhead from side to side in his efforts to rise. 'A man--at least he\r\nlooked like a man--wrapped in rags like a mummy's bandages, with a\r\nmoldering cloak drawn about him, and a hood. All I could see was his\r\neyes, as he crouched there in the shadows. I thought he was a shadow\r\nhimself, until I saw his eyes. They were like black jewels.\r\n\r\n'I made at him and swung my sword, but I missed him clean--how, Crom\r\nknows--and splintered that pole instead. He caught my wrist as I\r\nstaggered off balance, and his fingers burned like hot iron. All the\r\nstrength went out of me, and the floor rose and struck me like a club.\r\nThen he was gone, and I was down, and--curse him!--I can't move! I'm\r\nparalysed!'\r\n\r\nPallantides lifted the giant's hand, and his flesh crawled. On the\r\nking's wrist showed the blue marks of long, lean fingers. What hand\r\ncould grip so hard as to leave its print on that thick wrist?\r\nPallantides remembered that low laugh he had heard as he rushed into the\r\ntent, and cold perspiration beaded his skin. It had not been Conan who\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n'This is a thing diabolical!' whispered a trembling squire. 'Men say the\r\nchildren of darkness war for Tarascus!'\r\n\r\n'Be silent!' ordered Pallantides sternly.\r\n\r\nOutside, the dawn was dimming the stars. A light wind sprang up from the\r\npeaks, and brought the fanfare of a thousand trumpets. At the sound a\r\nconvulsive shudder ran through the king's mighty form. Again the veins\r\nin his temples knotted as he strove to break the invisible shackles\r\nwhich crushed him down.\r\n\r\n'Put my harness on me and tie me into my saddle,' he whispered. 'I'll\r\nlead the charge yet!'\r\n\r\nPallantides shook his head, and a squire plucked his skirt.\r\n\r\n'My lord, we are lost if the host learns the king has been smitten! Only\r\nhe could have led us to victory this day.'\r\n\r\n'Help me lift him on the dais,' answered the general.\r\n\r\nThey obeyed, and laid the helpless giant on the furs, and spread a\r\nsilken cloak over him. Pallantides turned to the five squires and\r\nsearched their pale faces long before he spoke.\r\n\r\n'Our lips must be sealed for ever as to what happens in this tent,' he\r\nsaid at last. 'The kingdom of Aquilonia depends upon it. One of you go\r\nand fetch me the officer Valannus, who is a captain of the Pellian\r\nspearmen.'\r\n\r\nThe squire indicated bowed and hastened from the tent, and Pallantides\r\nstood staring down at the stricken king, while outside trumpets blared,\r\ndrums thundered, and the roar of the multitudes rose in the growing\r\ndawn. Presently the squire returned with the officer Pallantides had\r\nnamed--a tall man, broad and powerful, built much like the king. Like\r\nhim, also, he had thick black hair. But his eyes were gray and he did\r\nnot resemble Conan in his features.\r\n\r\n'The king is stricken by a strange malady,' said Pallantides briefly. 'A\r\ngreat honor is yours; you are to wear his armor and ride at the head of\r\nthe host today. None must know that it is not the king who rides.'\r\n\r\n'It is an honor for which a man might gladly give up his life,'\r\nstammered the captain, overcome by the suggestion. 'Mitra grant that I\r\ndo not fail of this mighty trust!'\r\n\r\nAnd while the fallen king stared with burning eyes that reflected the\r\nbitter rage and humiliation that ate his heart, the squires stripped\r\nValannus of mail shirt, burganet and leg-pieces, and clad him in Conan's\r\narmor of black plate-mail, with the vizored salade, and the dark plumes\r\nnodding over the wyvern crest. Over all they put the silken surcoat with\r\nthe royal lion worked in gold upon the breast, and they girt him with a\r\nbroad gold-buckled belt which supported a jewel-hilted broadsword in a\r\ncloth-of-gold scabbard. While they worked, trumpets clamored outside,\r\narms clanged, and across the river rose a deep-throated roar as squadron\r\nafter squadron swung into place.\r\n\r\nFull-armed, Valannus dropped to his knee and bent his plumes before the\r\nfigure that lay on the dais.\r\n\r\n'Lord king, Mitra grant that I do not dishonor the harness I wear this\r\nday!'\r\n\r\n'Bring me Tarascus' head and I'll make you a baron!' In the stress of\r\nhis anguish Conan's veneer of civilization had fallen from him. His eyes\r\nflamed, he ground his teeth in fury and blood-lust, as barbaric as any\r\ntribesmen in the Cimmerian hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\nThe Cliffs Reel\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Aquilonian host was drawn up, long serried lines of pikemen and\r\nhorsemen in gleaming steel, when a giant figure in black armor emerged\r\nfrom the royal pavilion, and as he swung up into the saddle of the black\r\nstallion held by four squires, a roar that shook the mountains went up\r\nfrom the host. They shook their blades and thundered forth their acclaim\r\nof their warrior king--knights in gold-chased armor, pikemen in mail\r\ncoats and basinets, archers in their leather jerkins, with their\r\nlongbows in their left hand.\r\n\r\nThe host on the opposite side of the valley was in motion, trotting down\r\nthe long gentle slope toward the river; their steel shone through the\r\nmists of morning that swirled about their horses' feet.\r\n\r\nThe Aquilonian host moved leisurely to meet them. The measured tramp of\r\nthe armored horses made the ground tremble. Banners flung out long\r\nsilken folds in the morning wind; lances swayed like a bristling forest,\r\ndipped and sank, their pennons fluttering about them.\r\n\r\nTen men-at-arms, grim, taciturn veterans who could hold their tongues,\r\nguarded the royal pavilion. One squire stood in the tent, peering out\r\nthrough a slit in the doorway. But for the handful in the secret, no one\r\nelse in the vast host knew that it was not Conan who rode on the great\r\nstallion at the head of the army.\r\n\r\nThe Aquilonian host had assumed the customary formation: the strongest\r\npart was the center, composed entirely of heavily armed knights; the\r\nwings were made up of smaller bodies of horsemen, mounted men-at-arms,\r\nmostly, supported by pikemen and archers. The latter were Bossonians\r\nfrom the western marches, strongly built men of medium stature, in\r\nleathern jackets and iron head-pieces.\r\n\r\nThe Nemedian army came on in similar formation, and the two hosts moved\r\ntoward the river, the wings in advance of the centers. In the center of\r\nthe Aquilonian host the great lion banner streamed its billowing black\r\nfolds over the steel-clad figure on the black stallion.\r\n\r\nBut on his dais in the royal pavilion Conan groaned in anguish of\r\nspirit, and cursed with strange heathen oaths.\r\n\r\n'The hosts move together,' quoth the squire, watching from the door.\r\n'Hear the trumpets peal! Ha! The rising sun strikes fire from\r\nlance-heads and helmets until I am dazzled. It turns the river\r\ncrimson--aye, it will be truly crimson before this day is done!\r\n\r\n'The foe have reached the river. Now arrows fly between the hosts like\r\nstinging clouds that hide the sun. Ha! Well loosed, bowmen! The\r\nBossonians have the better of it! Hark to them shout!'\r\n\r\nFaintly in the ears of the king, above the din of trumpets and clanging\r\nsteel, came the deep fierce shout of the Bossonians as they drew and\r\nloosed in perfect unison.\r\n\r\n'Their archers seek to hold ours in play while their knights ride into\r\nthe river,' said the squire. 'The banks are not steep; they slope to the\r\nwater's edge. The knights come on, they crash through the willows. By\r\nMitra, the clothyard shafts find every crevice of their harness! Horses\r\nand men go down, struggling and thrashing in the water. It is not deep,\r\nnor is the current swift, but men are drowning there, dragged under by\r\ntheir armor, and trampled by the frantic horses. Now the knights of\r\nAquilonia advance. They ride into the water and engage the knights of\r\nNemedia. The water swirls about their horses' bellies and the clang of\r\nsword against sword is deafening.'\r\n\r\n'Crom!' burst in agony from Conan's lips. Life was coursing sluggishly\r\nback into his veins, but still he could not lift his mighty frame from\r\nthe dais.\r\n\r\n'The wings close in,' said the squire. 'Pikemen and swordsmen fight hand\r\nto hand in the stream, and behind them the bowmen ply their shafts.\r\n\r\n'By Mitra, the Nemedian arbalesters are sorely harried, and the\r\nBossonians arch their arrows to drop amid the rear ranks. Their center\r\ngains not a foot, and their wings are pushed back up from the stream\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\n'Crom, Ymir, and Mitra!' raged Conan. 'Gods and devils, could I but\r\nreach the fighting, if but to die at the first blow!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOutside through the long hot day the battle stormed and thundered. The\r\nvalley shook to charge and counter-charge, to the whistling of shafts,\r\nand the crash of rending shields and splintering lances. But the hosts\r\nof Aquilonia held fast. Once they were forced back from the bank, but a\r\ncounter-charge, with the black banner flowing over the black stallion,\r\nregained the lost ground. And like an iron rampart they held the right\r\nbank of the stream, and at last the squire gave Conan the news that the\r\nNemedians were falling back from the river.\r\n\r\n'Their wings are in confusion!' he cried. 'Their knights reel back from\r\nthe sword-play. But what is this? Your banner is in motion--the center\r\nsweeps into the stream! By Mitra, Valannus is leading the host across\r\nthe river!'\r\n\r\n'Fool!' groaned Conan. 'It may be a trick. He should hold his position;\r\nby dawn Prospero will be here with the Poitanian levies.'\r\n\r\n'The knights ride into a hail of arrows!' cried the squire. 'But they do\r\nnot falter! They sweep on--they have crossed! They charge up the slope!\r\nPallantides has hurled the wings across the river to their support! It\r\nis all he can do. The lion banner dips and staggers above the mêlée.\r\n\r\n'The knights of Nemedia make a stand. They are broken! They fall back!\r\nTheir left wing is in full flight, and our pikemen cut them down as they\r\nrun! I see Valannus, riding and smiting like a madman. He is carried\r\nbeyond himself by the fighting-lust. Men no longer look to Pallantides.\r\nThey follow Valannus, deeming him Conan as he rides with closed vizor.\r\n\r\n'But look! There is method in his madness! He swings wide of the\r\nNemedian front, with five thousand knights, the pick of the army. The\r\nmain host of the Nemedians is in confusion--and look! Their flank is\r\nprotected by the cliffs, but there is a defile left unguarded! It is\r\nlike a great cleft in the wall that opens again behind the Nemedian\r\nlines. By Mitra, Valannus sees and seizes the opportunity! He has driven\r\ntheir wing before him, and he leads his knights toward that defile. They\r\nswing wide of the main battle; they cut through a line of spearmen, they\r\ncharge into the defile!'\r\n\r\n'An ambush!' cried Conan, striving to struggle upright.\r\n\r\n'_No!_' shouted the squire exultantly. 'The whole Nemedian host is in\r\nfull sight! They have forgotten the defile! They never expected to be\r\npushed back that far. Oh, fool, fool, Tarascus, to make such a blunder!\r\nAh, I see lances and pennons pouring from the farther mouth of the\r\ndefile, beyond the Nemedian lines. They will smite those ranks from the\r\nrear and crumple them. _Mitra, what is this?_'\r\n\r\nHe staggered as the walls of the tent swayed drunkenly. Afar over the\r\nthunder of the fight rose a deep bellowing roar, indescribably ominous.\r\n\r\n'The cliffs reel!' shrieked the squire. 'Ah, gods, what is this? The\r\nriver foams out of its channel, and the peaks are crumbling! The ground\r\nshakes and horses and riders in armor are overthrown! The cliffs! The\r\ncliffs are falling!'\r\n\r\nWith his words there came a grinding rumble and a thunderous concussion,\r\nand the ground trembled. Over the roar of the battle sounded screams of\r\nmad terror.\r\n\r\n'The cliffs have crumbled!' cried the livid squire. 'They have thundered\r\ndown into the defile and crushed every living creature in it! I saw the\r\nlion banner wave an instant amid the dust and falling stones, and then\r\nit vanished! Ha, the Nemedians shout with triumph! Well may they shout,\r\nfor the fall of the cliffs has wiped out five thousand of our bravest\r\nknights--Hark!'\r\n\r\nTo Conan's ears came a vast torrent of sound, rising and rising in\r\nfrenzy: 'The king is dead! _The king is dead! Flee! Flee! The king is\r\ndead!_'\r\n\r\n'Liars!' panted Conan. 'Dogs! Knaves! Cowards! Oh, Crom, if I could but\r\nstand--but crawl to the river with my sword in my teeth! How, boy, do\r\nthey flee?'\r\n\r\n'Aye!' sobbed the squire. 'They spur for the river; they are broken,\r\nhurled on like spume before a storm. I see Pallantides striving to stem\r\nthe torrent--he is down, and the horses trample him! They rush into the\r\nriver, knights, bowmen, pikemen, all mixed and mingled in one mad\r\ntorrent of destruction. The Nemedians are on their heels, cutting them\r\ndown like corn.'\r\n\r\n'But they will make a stand on this side of the river!' cried the king.\r\nWith an effort that brought the sweat dripping from his temples, he\r\nheaved himself up on his elbows.\r\n\r\n'Nay!' cried the squire. 'They cannot! They are broken! Routed! Oh gods,\r\nthat I should live to see this day!'\r\n\r\nThen he remembered his duty and shouted to the men-at-arms who stood\r\nstolidly watching the flight of their comrades. 'Get a horse, swiftly,\r\nand help me lift the king upon it. We dare not bide here.'\r\n\r\nBut before they could do his bidding, the first drift of the storm was\r\nupon them. Knights and spearmen and archers fled among the tents,\r\nstumbling over ropes and baggage, and mingled with them were Nemedian\r\nriders, who smote right and left at all alien figures. Tent-ropes were\r\ncut, fire sprang up in a hundred places, and the plundering had already\r\nbegun. The grim guardsmen about Conan's tent died where they stood,\r\nsmiting and thrusting, and over their mangled corpses beat the hoofs of\r\nthe conquerors.\r\n\r\nBut the squire had drawn the flap close, and in the confused madness of\r\nthe slaughter none realized that the pavilion held an occupant. So the\r\nflight and the pursuit swept past, and roared away up the valley, and\r\nthe squire looked out presently to see a cluster of men approaching the\r\nroyal tent with evident purpose.\r\n\r\n'Here comes the king of Nemedia with four companions and his squire,'\r\nquoth he. 'He will accept your surrender, my fair lord--'\r\n\r\n'Surrender the devil's heart!' gritted the king.\r\n\r\nHe had forced himself up to a sitting posture. He swung his legs\r\npainfully off the dais, and staggered upright, reeling drunkenly. The\r\nsquire ran to assist him, but Conan pushed him away.\r\n\r\n'Give me that bow!' he gritted, indicating a longbow and quiver that\r\nhung from a tent-pole.\r\n\r\n'But your Majesty!' cried the squire in great perturbation. 'The battle\r\nis lost! It were the part of majesty to yield with the dignity becoming\r\none of royal blood!'\r\n\r\n'I have no royal blood,' ground Conan. 'I am a barbarian and the son of\r\na blacksmith.'\r\n\r\nWrenching away the bow and an arrow he staggered toward the opening of\r\nthe pavilion. So formidable was his appearance, naked but for short\r\nleather breeks and sleeveless shirt, open to reveal his great, hairy\r\nchest, with his huge limbs and his blue eyes blazing under his tangled\r\nblack mane, that the squire shrank back, more afraid of his king than of\r\nthe whole Nemedian host.\r\n\r\nReeling on wide-braced legs Conan drunkenly tore the door-flap open and\r\nstaggered out under the canopy. The king of Nemedia and his companions\r\nhad dismounted, and they halted short, staring in wonder at the\r\napparition confronting them.\r\n\r\n'Here I am, you jackals!' roared the Cimmerian. 'I am the king! Death to\r\nyou, dog-brothers!'\r\n\r\nHe jerked the arrow to its head and loosed, and the shaft feathered\r\nitself in the breast of the knight who stood beside Tarascus. Conan\r\nhurled the bow at the king of Nemedia.\r\n\r\n'Curse my shaky hand! Come in and take me if you dare!'\r\n\r\nReeling backward on unsteady legs, he fell with his shoulders against a\r\ntent-pole, and propped upright, he lifted his great sword with both\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n'By Mitra, it _is_ the king!' swore Tarascus. He cast a swift look about\r\nhim, and laughed. 'That other was a jackal in his harness! In, dogs, and\r\ntake his head!'\r\n\r\nThe three soldiers--men-at-arms wearing the emblem of the royal\r\nguards--rushed at the king, and one felled the squire with a blow of a\r\nmace. The other two fared less well. As the first rushed in, lifting his\r\nsword, Conan met him with a sweeping stroke that severed mail-links like\r\ncloth, and sheared the Nemedian's arm and shoulder clean from his body.\r\nHis corpse, pitching backward, fell across his companion's legs. The man\r\nstumbled, and before he could recover, the great sword was through him.\r\n\r\nConan wrenched out his steel with a racking gasp, and staggered back\r\nagainst the tent-pole. His great limbs trembled, his chest heaved, and\r\nsweat poured down his face and neck. But his eyes flamed with exultant\r\nsavagery and he panted: 'Why do you stand afar off, dog of Belverus? I\r\ncan't reach you; come in and die!'\r\n\r\nTarascus hesitated, glanced at the remaining man-at-arms, and his\r\nsquire, a gaunt, saturnine man in black mail, and took a step forward.\r\nHe was far inferior in size and strength to the giant Cimmerian, but he\r\nwas in full armor, and was famed in all the western nations as a\r\nswordsman. But his squire caught his arm.\r\n\r\n'Nay, your Majesty, do not throw away your life. I will summon archers\r\nto shoot this barbarian, as we shoot lions.'\r\n\r\nNeither of them had noticed that a chariot had approached while the\r\nfight was going on, and now came to a halt before them. But Conan saw,\r\nlooking over their shoulders, and a queer chill sensation crawled along\r\nhis spine. There was something vaguely unnatural about the appearance of\r\nthe black horses that drew the vehicle, but it was the occupant of the\r\nchariot that arrested the king's attention.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall man, superbly built, clad in a long unadorned silk robe.\r\nHe wore a Shemitish head-dress, and its lower folds hid his features,\r\nexcept for the dark, magnetic eyes. The hands that grasped the reins,\r\npulling the rearing horses back on their haunches, were white but\r\nstrong. Conan glared at the stranger, all his primitive instincts\r\nroused. He sensed an aura of menace and power that exuded from this\r\nveiled figure, a menace as definite as the windless waving of tall grass\r\nthat marks the path of the serpent.\r\n\r\n'Hail, Xaltotun!' exclaimed Tarascus. 'Here is the king of Aquilonia! He\r\ndid not die in the landslide as we thought.'\r\n\r\n'I know,' answered the other, without bothering to say how he knew.\r\n'What is your present intention?'\r\n\r\n'I will summon the archers to slay him,' answered the Nemedian. 'As long\r\nas he lives he will be dangerous to us.'\r\n\r\n'Yet even a dog has uses,' answered Xaltotun. 'Take him alive.'\r\n\r\nConan laughed raspingly. 'Come in and try!' he challenged. 'But for my\r\ntreacherous legs I'd hew you out of that chariot like a woodman hewing a\r\ntree. But you'll never take me alive, damn you!'\r\n\r\n'He speaks the truth, I fear,' said Tarascus. 'The man is a barbarian,\r\nwith the senseless ferocity of a wounded tiger. Let me summon the\r\narchers.'\r\n\r\n'Watch me and learn wisdom,' advised Xaltotun.\r\n\r\nHis hand dipped into his robe and came out with something shining--a\r\nglistening sphere. This he threw suddenly at Conan. The Cimmerian\r\ncontemptuously struck it aside with his sword--at the instant of contact\r\nthere was a sharp explosion, a flare of white, blinding flame, and Conan\r\npitched senseless to the ground.\r\n\r\n'He is dead?' Tarascus' tone was more assertion than inquiry.\r\n\r\n'No. He is but senseless. He will recover his senses in a few hours. Bid\r\nyour men bind his arms and legs and lift him into my chariot.'\r\n\r\nWith a gesture Tarascus did so, and they heaved the senseless king into\r\nthe chariot, grunting with their burden. Xaltotun threw a velvet cloak\r\nover his body, completely covering him from any who might peer in. He\r\ngathered the reins in his hands.\r\n\r\n'I'm for Belverus,' he said. 'Tell Amalric that I will be with him if he\r\nneeds me. But with Conan out of the way, and his army broken, lance and\r\nsword should suffice for the rest of the conquest. Prospero cannot be\r\nbringing more than ten thousand men to the field, and will doubtless\r\nfall back to Tarantia when he hears the news of the battle. Say nothing\r\nto Amalric or Valerius or anyone about our capture. Let them think Conan\r\ndied in the fall of the cliffs.'\r\n\r\nHe looked at the man-at-arms for a long space, until the guardsman moved\r\nrestlessly, nervous under the scrutiny.\r\n\r\n'What is that about your waist?' Xaltotun demanded.\r\n\r\n'Why, my girdle, may it please you, my lord!' stuttered the amazed\r\nguardsman.\r\n\r\n'You lie!' Xaltotun's laugh was merciless as a sword-edge. 'It is a\r\npoisonous serpent! What a fool you are, to wear a reptile about your\r\nwaist!'\r\n\r\nWith distended eyes the man looked down; and to his utter horror he saw\r\nthe buckle of his girdle rear up at him. It was a snake's head! He saw\r\nthe evil eyes and the dripping fangs, heard the hiss and felt the\r\nloathsome contact of the thing about his body. He screamed hideously and\r\nstruck at it with his naked hand, felt its fangs flesh themselves in\r\nthat hand--and then he stiffened and fell heavily. Tarascus looked down\r\nat him without expression. He saw only the leathern girdle and the\r\nbuckle, the pointed tongue of which was stuck in the guardsman's palm.\r\nXaltotun turned his hypnotic gaze on Tarascus' squire, and the man\r\nturned ashen and began to tremble, but the king interposed: 'Nay, we can\r\ntrust him.'\r\n\r\nThe sorcerer tautened the reins and swung the horses around.\r\n\r\n'See that this piece of work remains secret. If I am needed, let Altaro,\r\nOrastes' servant, summon me as I have taught him. I will be in your\r\npalace at Belverus.'\r\n\r\nTarascus lifted his hand in salutation, but his expression was not\r\npleasant to see as he looked after the departing mesmerist.\r\n\r\n'Why should he spare the Cimmerian?' whispered the frightened squire.\r\n\r\n'That I am wondering myself,' grunted Tarascus.\r\n\r\nBehind the rumbling chariot the dull roar of battle and pursuit faded in\r\nthe distance; the setting sun rimmed the cliffs with scarlet flame, and\r\nthe chariot moved into the vast blue shadows floating up out of the\r\neast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n'From What Hell Have You Crawled?'\r\n\r\n\r\nOf that long ride in the chariot of Xaltotun, Conan knew nothing. He lay\r\nlike a dead man while the bronze wheels clashed over the stones of\r\nmountain roads and swished through the deep grass of fertile valleys,\r\nand finally dropping down from the rugged heights, rumbled rhythmically\r\nalong the broad white road that winds through the rich meadowlands to\r\nthe walls of Belverus.\r\n\r\nJust before dawn some faint reviving of life touched him. He heard a\r\nmumble of voices, the groan of ponderous hinges. Through a slit in the\r\ncloak that covered him he saw, faintly in the lurid glare of torches,\r\nthe great black arch of a gateway, and the bearded faces of men-at-arms,\r\nthe torches striking fire from their spearheads and helmets.\r\n\r\n'How went the battle, my fair lord?' spoke an eager voice, in the\r\nNemedian tongue.\r\n\r\n'Well indeed,' was the curt reply. 'The king of Aquilonia lies slain and\r\nhis host is broken.'\r\n\r\nA babble of excited voices rose, drowned the next instant by the\r\nwhirling wheels of the chariot on the flags. Sparks flashed from under\r\nthe revolving rims as Xaltotun lashed his steeds through the arch. But\r\nConan heard one of the guardsmen mutter: 'From beyond the border to\r\nBelverus between sunset and dawn! And the horses scarcely sweating! By\r\nMitra, they--' Then silence drank the voices, and there was only the\r\nclatter of hoofs and wheels along the shadowy street.\r\n\r\nWhat he had heard registered itself on Conan's brain but suggested\r\nnothing to him. He was like a mindless automaton that hears and sees,\r\nbut does not understand. Sights and sounds flowed meaninglessly about\r\nhim. He lapsed again into a deep lethargy, and was only dimly aware\r\nwhen the chariot halted in a deep, high-walled court, and he was lifted\r\nfrom it by many hands and borne up a winding stone stair, and down a\r\nlong dim corridor. Whispers, stealthy footsteps, unrelated sounds surged\r\nor rustled about him, irrelevant and far away.\r\n\r\nYet his ultimate awakening was abrupt and crystal-clear. He possessed\r\nfull knowledge of the battle in the mountains and its sequences, and he\r\nhad a good idea of where he was.\r\n\r\nHe lay on a velvet couch, clad as he was the day before, but with his\r\nlimbs loaded with chains not even he could break. The room in which he\r\nlay was furnished with somber magnificence, the walls covered with black\r\nvelvet tapestries, the floor with heavy purple carpets. There was no\r\nsign of door or window, and one curiously carven gold lamp, swinging\r\nfrom the fretted ceiling, shed a lurid light over all.\r\n\r\nIn that light the figure seated in a silver, throne-like chair before\r\nhim seemed unreal and fantastic, with an illusiveness of outline that\r\nwas heightened by a filmy silken robe. But the features were\r\ndistinct--unnaturally so in that uncertain light. It was almost as if a\r\nweird nimbus played about the man's head, casting the bearded face into\r\nbold relief, so that it was the only definite and distinct reality in\r\nthat mystic, ghostly chamber.\r\n\r\nIt was a magnificent face, with strongly chiseled features of classical\r\nbeauty. There was, indeed, something disquieting about the calm\r\ntranquility of its aspect, a suggestion of more than human knowledge, of\r\na profound certitude beyond human assurance. Also an uneasy sensation of\r\nfamiliarity twitched at the back of Conan's consciousness. He had never\r\nseen this man's face before, he well knew; yet those features reminded\r\nhim of something or someone. It was like encountering in the flesh some\r\ndream-image that had haunted one in nightmares.\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' demanded the king belligerently, struggling to a sitting\r\nposition in spite of his chains.\r\n\r\n'Men call me Xaltotun,' was the reply, in a strong, golden voice.\r\n\r\n'What place is this?' the Cimmerian next demanded.\r\n\r\n'A chamber in the palace of King Tarascus, in Belverus.'\r\n\r\nConan was not surprised. Belverus, the capital, was at the same time the\r\nlargest Nemedian city so near the border.\r\n\r\n'And where's Tarascus?'\r\n\r\n'With the army.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' growled Conan, 'if you mean to murder me, why don't you do it\r\nand get it over with?'\r\n\r\n'I did not save you from the king's archers to murder you in Belverus,'\r\nanswered Xaltotun.\r\n\r\n'What the devil did you do to me?' demanded Conan.\r\n\r\n'I blasted your consciousness,' answered Xaltotun. 'How, you would not\r\nunderstand. Call it black magic, if you will.'\r\n\r\nConan had already reached that conclusion, and was mulling over\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\n'I think I understand why you spared my life,' he rumbled. 'Amalric\r\nwants to keep me as a check on Valerius, in case the impossible happens\r\nand he becomes king of Aquilonia. It's well known that the baron of Tor\r\nis behind this move to seat Valerius on my throne. And if I know\r\nAmalric, he doesn't intend that Valerius shall be anything more than a\r\nfigurehead, as Tarascus is now.'\r\n\r\n'Amalric knows nothing of your capture,' answered Xaltotun. 'Neither\r\ndoes Valerius. Both think you died at Valkia.'\r\n\r\nConan's eyes narrowed as he stared at the man in silence.\r\n\r\n'I sensed a brain behind all this,' he muttered, 'but I thought it was\r\nAmalric's. Are Amalric, Tarascus and Valerius all but puppets dancing on\r\nyour string? Who are you?'\r\n\r\n'What does it matter? If I told you, you would not believe me. What if I\r\ntold you I might set you back on the throne of Aquilonia?'\r\n\r\nConan's eyes burned on him like a wolf.\r\n\r\n'What's your price?'\r\n\r\n'Obedience to me.'\r\n\r\n'Go to hell with your offer!' snarled Conan. 'I'm no figurehead. I won\r\nmy crown with my sword. Besides, it's beyond your power to buy and sell\r\nthe throne of Aquilonia at your will. The kingdom's not conquered; one\r\nbattle doesn't decide a war.'\r\n\r\n'You war against more than swords,' answered Xaltotun. 'Was it a\r\nmortal's sword that felled you in your tent before the fight? Nay, it\r\nwas a child of the dark, a waif of outer space, whose fingers were afire\r\nwith the frozen coldness of the black gulfs, which froze the blood in\r\nyour veins and the marrow of your thews. Coldness so cold it burned your\r\nflesh like white-hot iron!\r\n\r\n'Was it chance that led the man who wore your harness to lead his\r\nknights into the defile?--chance that brought the cliffs crashing down\r\nupon them?'\r\n\r\nConan glared at him unspeaking, feeling a chill along his spine. Wizards\r\nand sorcerers abounded in his barbaric mythology, and any fool could\r\ntell that this was no common man. Conan sensed an inexplicable something\r\nabout him that set him apart--an alien aura of Time and Space, a sense\r\nof tremendous and sinister antiquity. But his stubborn spirit refused to\r\nflinch.\r\n\r\n'The fall of the cliffs was chance,' he muttered truculently. 'The\r\ncharge into the defile was what any man would have done.'\r\n\r\n'Not so. You would not have led a charge into it. You would have\r\nsuspected a trap. You would never have crossed the river in the first\r\nplace, until you were sure the Nemedian rout was real. Hypnotic\r\nsuggestions would not have invaded your mind, even in the madness of\r\nbattle, to make you mad, and rush blindly into the trap laid for you, as\r\nit did the lesser man who masqueraded as you.'\r\n\r\n'Then if this was all planned,' Conan grunted skeptically, 'all a plot\r\nto trap my host, why did not the \"child of darkness\" kill me in my\r\ntent?'\r\n\r\n'Because I wished to take you alive. It took no wizardry to predict that\r\nPallantides would send another man out in your harness. I wanted you\r\nalive and unhurt. You may fit into my scheme of things. There is a vital\r\npower about you greater than the craft and cunning of my allies. You are\r\na bad enemy, but might make a fine vassal.'\r\n\r\nConan spat savagely at the word, and Xaltotun, ignoring his fury, took a\r\ncrystal globe from a near-by table and placed it before him. He did not\r\nsupport it in any way, nor place it on anything, but it hung motionless\r\nin midair, as solidly as if it rested on an iron pedestal. Conan snorted\r\nat this bit of necromancy, but he was nevertheless impressed.\r\n\r\n'Would you know of what goes on in Aquilonia?' he asked.\r\n\r\nConan did not reply, but the sudden rigidity of his form betrayed his\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nXaltotun stared into the cloudy depths, and spoke: 'It is now the\r\nevening of the day after the battle of Valkia. Last night the main body\r\nof the army camped by Valkia, while squadrons of knights harried the\r\nfleeing Aquilonians. At dawn the host broke camp and pushed westward\r\nthrough the mountains. Prospero, with ten thousand Poitanians, was miles\r\nfrom the battlefield when he met the fleeing survivors in the early\r\ndawn. He had pushed on all night, hoping to reach the field before the\r\nbattle joined. Unable to rally the remnants of the broken host, he fell\r\nback toward Tarantia. Riding hard, replacing his wearied horses with\r\nsteeds seized from the countryside, he approaches Tarantia.\r\n\r\n'I see his weary knights, their armor gray with dust, their pennons\r\ndrooping as they push their tired horses through the plain. I see, also,\r\nthe streets of Tarantia. The city is in turmoil. Somehow word has\r\nreached the people of the defeat and the death of King Conan. The mob is\r\nmad with fear, crying out that the king is dead, and there is none to\r\nlead them against the Nemedians. Giant shadows rush on Aquilonia from\r\nthe east, and the sky is black with vultures.'\r\n\r\nConan cursed deeply.\r\n\r\n'What are these but words? The raggedest beggar in the street might\r\nprophesy as much. If you say you saw all that in the glass ball, then\r\nyou're a liar as well as a knave, of which last there's no doubt!\r\nProspero will hold Tarantia, and the barons will rally to him. Count\r\nTrocero of Poitain commands the kingdom in my absence, and he'll drive\r\nthese Nemedian dogs howling back to their kennels. What are fifty\r\nthousand Nemedians? Aquilonia will swallow them up. They'll never see\r\nBelverus again. It's not Aquilonia which was conquered at Valkia; it was\r\nonly Conan.'\r\n\r\n'Aquilonia is doomed,' answered Xaltotun, unmoved. 'Lance and ax and\r\ntorch shall conquer her; or if they fail, powers from the dark of ages\r\nshall march against her. As the cliffs fell at Valkia, so shall walled\r\ncities and mountains fall, if the need arise, and rivers roar from their\r\nchannels to drown whole provinces.\r\n\r\n'Better if steel and bowstring prevail without further aid from the\r\n_arts_, for the constant use of mighty spells sometimes sets forces in\r\nmotion that might rock the universe.'\r\n\r\n'From what hell have you crawled, you nighted dog?' muttered Conan,\r\nstaring at the man. The Cimmerian involuntarily shivered; he sensed\r\nsomething incredibly ancient, incredibly evil.\r\n\r\nXaltotun lifted his head, as if listening to whispers across the void.\r\nHe seemed to have forgotten his prisoner. Then he shook his head\r\nimpatiently, and glanced impersonally at Conan.\r\n\r\n'What? Why, if I told you, you would not believe me. But I am wearied of\r\nconversation with you; it is less fatiguing to destroy a walled city\r\nthan it is to frame my thoughts in words a brainless barbarian can\r\nunderstand.'\r\n\r\n'If my hands were free,' opined Conan, 'I'd soon make a brainless corpse\r\nout of you.'\r\n\r\n'I do not doubt it, if I were fool enough to give you the opportunity,'\r\nanswered Xaltotun, clapping his hands.\r\n\r\nHis manner had changed; there was impatience in his tone, and a certain\r\nnervousness in his manner, though Conan did not think this attitude was\r\nin any way connected with himself.\r\n\r\n'Consider what I have told you, barbarian,' said Xaltotun. 'You will\r\nhave plenty of leisure. I have not yet decided what I shall do with you.\r\nIt depends on circumstances yet unborn. But let this be impressed upon\r\nyou: that if I decide to use you in my game, it will be better to submit\r\nwithout resistance than to suffer my wrath.'\r\n\r\nConan spat a curse at him, just as hangings that masked a door swung\r\napart and four giant negroes entered. Each was clad only in a silken\r\nbreech-cloth supported by a girdle, from which hung a great key.\r\n\r\nXaltotun gestured impatiently toward the king and turned away, as if\r\ndismissing the matter entirely from his mind. His fingers twitched\r\nqueerly. From a carven green jade box he took a handful of shimmering\r\nblack dust, and placed it in a brazier which stood on a golden tripod at\r\nhis elbow. The crystal globe, which he seemed to have forgotten, fell\r\nsuddenly to the floor, as if its invisible support had been removed.\r\n\r\nThen the blacks had lifted Conan--for so loaded with chains was he that\r\nhe could not walk--and carried him from the chamber. A glance back,\r\nbefore the heavy, gold-bound teak door was closed, showed him Xaltotun\r\nleaning back in his throne-like chair, his arms folded, while a thin\r\nwisp of smoke curled up from the brazier. Conan's scalp prickled. In\r\nStygia, that ancient and evil kingdom that lay far to the south, he had\r\nseen such black dust before. It was the pollen of the black lotus, which\r\ncreates death-like sleep and monstrous dreams; and he knew that only the\r\ngrisly wizards of the Black Ring, which is the nadir of evil,\r\nvoluntarily seek the scarlet nightmares of the black lotus, to revive\r\ntheir necromantic powers.\r\n\r\nThe Black Ring was a fable and a lie to most folk of the western world,\r\nbut Conan knew of its ghastly reality, and its grim votaries who\r\npractise their abominable sorceries amid the black vaults of Stygia and\r\nthe nighted domes of accursed Sabatea.\r\n\r\nHe glanced back at the cryptic, gold-bound door, shuddering at what it\r\nhid.\r\n\r\nWhether it was day or night the king could not tell. The palace of King\r\nTarascus seemed a shadowy, nighted place, that shunned natural\r\nillumination. The spirit of darkness and shadow hovered over it, and\r\nthat spirit, Conan felt, was embodied in the stranger Xaltotun. The\r\nnegroes carried the king along a winding corridor so dimly lighted that\r\nthey moved through it like black ghosts bearing a dead man, and down a\r\nstone stair that wound endlessly. A torch in the hand of one cast the\r\ngreat deformed shadows streaming along the wall; it was like the descent\r\ninto hell of a corpse borne by dusky demons.\r\n\r\nAt last they reached the foot of the stair, and then they traversed a\r\nlong straight corridor, with a blank wall on one hand pierced by an\r\noccasional arched doorway with a stair leading up behind it, and on the\r\nother hand another wall showing heavy barred doors at regular intervals\r\nof a few feet.\r\n\r\nHalting before one of these doors, one of the blacks produced the key\r\nthat hung at his girdle, and turned it in the lock. Then, pushing open\r\nthe grille, they entered with their captive. They were in a small\r\ndungeon with heavy stone walls, floor and ceiling, and in the opposite\r\nwall there was another grilled door. What lay beyond that door Conan\r\ncould not tell, but he did not believe it was another corridor. The\r\nglimmering light of the torch, flickering through the bars, hinted at\r\nshadowy spaciousness and echoing depths.\r\n\r\nIn one corner of the dungeon, near the door through which they had\r\nentered, a cluster of rusty chains hung from a great iron ring set in\r\nthe stone. In these chains a skeleton dangled. Conan glared at it with\r\nsome curiosity, noticing the state of the bare bones, most of which\r\nwere splintered and broken; the skull which had fallen from the\r\nvertebrae, was crushed as if by some savage blow of tremendous force.\r\n\r\nStolidly one of the blacks, not the one who had opened the door, removed\r\nthe chains from the ring, using his key on the massive lock, and dragged\r\nthe mass of rusty metal and shattered bones over to one side. Then they\r\nfastened Conan's chains to that ring, and the third black turned his key\r\nin the lock of the farther door, grunting when he had assured himself\r\nthat it was properly fastened.\r\n\r\nThen they regarded Conan cryptically, slit-eyed ebony giants, the torch\r\nstriking highlights from their glossy skin.\r\n\r\nHe who held the key to the nearer door was moved to remark, gutturally:\r\n'This your palace now, white dog-king! None but master and we know. All\r\npalace sleep. We keep secret. You live and die here, maybe. Like him!'\r\nHe contemptuously kicked the shattered skull and sent it clattering\r\nacross the stone floor.\r\n\r\nConan did not deign to reply to the taunt, and the black, galled perhaps\r\nby his prisoner's silence, muttered a curse, stooped and spat full in\r\nthe king's face. It was an unfortunate move for the black. Conan was\r\nseated on the floor, the chains about his waist; ankles and wrists\r\nlocked to the ring in the wall. He could neither rise, nor move more\r\nthan a yard out from the wall. But there was considerable slack in the\r\nchains that shackled his wrists, and before the bullet-shaped head could\r\nbe withdrawn out of reach, the king gathered this slack in his mighty\r\nhand and smote the black on the head. The man fell like a butchered ox,\r\nand his comrades stared to see him lying with his scalp laid open, and\r\nblood oozing from his nose and ears.\r\n\r\nBut they attempted no reprisal, nor did they accept Conan's urgent\r\ninvitation to approach within reach of the bloody chain in his hand.\r\nPresently, grunting in their ape-like speech, they lifted the senseless\r\nblack and bore him out like a sack of wheat, arms and legs dangling.\r\nThey used his key to lock the door behind them, but did not remove it\r\nfrom the gold chain that fastened it to his girdle. They took the torch\r\nwith them, and as they moved up the corridor the darkness slunk behind\r\nthem like an animate thing. Their soft padding footsteps died away, with\r\nthe glimmer of their torch, and darkness and silence remained\r\nunchallenged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\nThe Haunter of the Pits\r\n\r\n\r\nConan lay still, enduring the weight of his chains and the despair of\r\nhis position with the stoicism of the wilds that had bred him. He did\r\nnot move, because the jangle of his chains, when he shifted his body,\r\nsounded startlingly loud in the darkness and stillness, and it was his\r\ninstinct, born of a thousand wilderness-bred ancestors, not to betray\r\nhis position in his helplessness. This did not result from a logical\r\nreasoning process; he did not lie quiet because he reasoned that the\r\ndarkness hid lurking dangers that might discover him in his\r\nhelplessness. Xaltotun had assured him that he was not to be harmed, and\r\nConan believed that it was in the man's interest to preserve him, at\r\nleast for the time being. But the instincts of the wild were there, that\r\nhad caused him in his childhood to lie hidden and silent while wild\r\nbeasts prowled about his covert.\r\n\r\nEven his keen eyes could not pierce the solid darkness. Yet after a\r\nwhile, after a period of time he had no way of estimating, a faint glow\r\nbecame apparent, a sort of slanting gray beam, by which Conan could see,\r\nvaguely, the bars of the door at his elbow, and even make out the\r\nskeleton of the other grille. This puzzled him, until at last he\r\nrealized the explanation. He was far below ground, in the pits below the\r\npalace; yet for some reason a shaft had been constructed from somewhere\r\nabove. Outside, the moon had risen to a point where its light slanted\r\ndimly down the shaft. He reflected that in this manner he could tell the\r\npassing of the days and nights. Perhaps the sun, too, would shine down\r\nthat shaft, though on the other hand it might be closed by day. Perhaps\r\nit was a subtle method of torture, allowing a prisoner but a glimpse of\r\ndaylight or moonlight.\r\n\r\nHis gaze fell on the broken bones in the farther corner, glimmering\r\ndimly. He did not tax his brain with futile speculation as to who the\r\nwretch had been and for what reason he had been doomed, but he wondered\r\nat the shattered condition of the bones. They had not been broken on a\r\nrack. Then, as he looked, another unsavory detail made itself evident.\r\nThe shin-bones were split lengthwise, and there was but one explanation;\r\nthey had been broken in that manner in order to obtain the marrow. Yet\r\nwhat creature but man breaks bones for their marrow? Perhaps those\r\nremnants were mute evidence of a horrible, cannibalistic feast, of some\r\nwretch driven to madness by starvation. Conan wondered if his own bones\r\nwould be found at some future date, hanging in their rusty chains. He\r\nfought down the unreasoning panic of a trapped wolf.\r\n\r\nThe Cimmerian did not curse, scream, weep or rave as a civilized man\r\nmight have done. But the pain and turmoil in his bosom were none the\r\nless fierce. His great limbs quivered with the intensity of his\r\nemotions. Somewhere, far to the westward, the Nemedian host was slashing\r\nand burning its way through the heart of his kingdom. The small host of\r\nthe Poitanians could not stand before them. Prospero might be able to\r\nhold Tarantia for weeks, or months; but eventually, if not relieved, he\r\nmust surrender to greater numbers. Surely the barons would rally to him\r\nagainst the invaders. But in the meanwhile he, Conan, must lie helpless\r\nin a darkened cell, while others led his spears and fought for his\r\nkingdom. The king ground his powerful teeth in red rage.\r\n\r\nThen he stiffened as outside the farther door he heard a stealthy step.\r\nStraining his eyes he made out a bent, indistinct figure outside the\r\ngrille. There was a rasp of metal against metal, and he heard the clink\r\nof tumblers, as if a key had been turned in the lock. Then the figure\r\nmoved silently out of his range of vision. Some guard, he supposed,\r\ntrying the lock. After a while he heard the sound repeated faintly\r\nsomewhere farther on, and that was followed by the soft opening of a\r\ndoor, and then a swift scurry of softly shod feet retreated in the\r\ndistance. Then silence fell again.\r\n\r\nConan listened for what seemed a long time, but which could not have\r\nbeen, for the moon still shone down the hidden shaft, but he heard no\r\nfurther sound. He shifted his position at last, and his chains clanked.\r\nThen he heard another, lighter footfall--a soft step outside the nearer\r\ndoor, the door through which he had entered the cell. An instant later a\r\nslender figure was etched dimly in the gray light.\r\n\r\n'King Conan!' a soft voice intoned urgently. 'Oh, my lord, are you\r\nthere?'\r\n\r\n'Where else?' he answered guardedly, twisting his head about to stare at\r\nthe apparition.\r\n\r\nIt was a girl who stood grasping the bars with her slender fingers. The\r\ndim glow behind her outlined her supple figure through the wisp of silk\r\ntwisted about her loins, and shone vaguely on jeweled breast-plates. Her\r\ndark eyes gleamed in the shadows, her white limbs glistened softly, like\r\nalabaster. Her hair was a mass of dark foam, at the burnished luster of\r\nwhich the dim light only hinted.\r\n\r\n'The keys to your shackles and to the farther door!' she whispered, and\r\na slim white hand came through the bars and dropped three objects with a\r\nclink to the flags beside him.\r\n\r\n'What game is this?' he demanded. 'You speak in the Nemedian tongue, and\r\nI have no friends in Nemedia. What deviltry is your master up to now?\r\nHas he sent you here to mock me?'\r\n\r\n'It is no mockery!' The girl was trembling violently. Her bracelets and\r\nbreast-plates clinked against the bars she grasped. 'I swear by Mitra! I\r\nstole the keys from the black jailers. They are the keepers of the pits,\r\nand each bears a key which will open only one set of locks. I made them\r\ndrunk. The one whose head you broke was carried away to a leech, and I\r\ncould not get his key. But the others I stole. Oh, please do not\r\nloiter! Beyond these dungeons lie the pits which are the doors to hell.'\r\n\r\nSomewhat impressed, Conan tried the keys dubiously, expecting to meet\r\nonly failure and a burst of mocking laughter. But he was galvanized to\r\ndiscover that one, indeed, loosed him of his shackles, fitting not only\r\nthe lock that held them to the ring, but the locks on his limbs as well.\r\nA few seconds later he stood upright, exulting fiercely in his\r\ncomparative freedom. A quick stride carried him to the grille, and his\r\nfingers closed about a bar and the slender wrist that was pressed\r\nagainst it, imprisoning the owner, who lifted her face bravely to his\r\nfierce gaze.\r\n\r\n'Who are you, girl?' he demanded. 'Why do you do this?'\r\n\r\n'I am only Zenobia,' she murmured, with a catch of breathlessness, as if\r\nin fright; 'only a girl of the king's seraglio.'\r\n\r\n'Unless this is some cursed trick,' muttered Conan, 'I cannot see why\r\nyou bring me these keys.'\r\n\r\nShe bowed her dark head, and then lifted it and looked full into his\r\nsuspicious eyes. Tears sparkled like jewels on her long dark lashes.\r\n\r\n'I am only a girl of the king's seraglio,' she said, with a certain\r\nproud humility. 'He has never glanced at me, and probably never will. I\r\nam less than one of the dogs that gnaw the bones in his banquet hall.\r\n\r\n'But I am no painted toy; I am of flesh and blood. I breathe, hate,\r\nfear, rejoice and love. And I have loved you, King Conan, ever since I\r\nsaw you riding at the head of your knights along the streets of Belverus\r\nwhen you visited King Nimed, years ago. My heart tugged at its strings\r\nto leap from my bosom and fall in the dust of the street under your\r\nhorse's hoofs.'\r\n\r\nColor flooded her countenance as she spoke, but her dark eyes did not\r\nwaver. Conan did not at once reply; wild and passionate and untamed he\r\nwas, yet any but the most brutish of men must be touched with a certain\r\nawe or wonder at the baring of a woman's naked soul.\r\n\r\nShe bent her head then, and pressed her red lips to the fingers that\r\nimprisoned her slim wrist. Then she flung up her head as if in sudden\r\nrecollection of their position, and terror flared in her dark eyes.\r\n\r\n'Haste!' she whispered urgently. 'It is past midnight. You must be\r\ngone.'\r\n\r\n'But won't they skin you alive for stealing these keys?'\r\n\r\n'They'll never know. If the black men remember in the morning who gave\r\nthem the wine, they will not dare admit the keys were stolen from them\r\nwhile they were drunk. The key that I could not obtain is the one that\r\nunlocks this door. You must make your way to freedom through the pits.\r\nWhat awful perils lurk beyond that door I cannot even guess. But greater\r\ndanger lurks for you if you remain in this cell.\r\n\r\n'King Tarascus has returned--'\r\n\r\n'What? Tarascus?'\r\n\r\n'Aye! He has returned, in great secrecy, and not long ago he descended\r\ninto the pits and then came out again, pale and shaking, like a man who\r\nhad dared a great hazard. I heard him whisper to his squire, Arideus,\r\nthat despite Xaltotun you should die.'\r\n\r\n'What of Xaltotun?' murmured Conan.\r\n\r\nHe felt her shudder.\r\n\r\n'Do not speak of him!' she whispered. 'Demons are often summoned by the\r\nsound of their names. The slaves say that he lies in his chamber, behind\r\na bolted door, dreaming the dreams of the black lotus. I believe that\r\neven Tarascus secretly fears him, or he would slay you openly. But he\r\nhas been in the pits tonight, and what he did there, only Mitra knows.'\r\n\r\n'I wonder if that could have been Tarascus who fumbled at my cell door\r\nawhile ago?' muttered Conan.\r\n\r\n'Here is a dagger!' she whispered, pressing something through the bars.\r\nHis eager fingers closed on an object familiar to their touch. 'Go\r\nquickly through yonder door, turn to the left and make your way along\r\nthe cells until you come to a stone stair. On your life do not stray\r\nfrom the line of the cells! Climb the stair and open the door at the\r\ntop; one of the keys will fit it. If it be the will of Mitra, I will\r\nawait you there.' Then she was gone, with a patter of light slippered\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nConan shrugged his shoulders, and turned toward the farther grille. This\r\nmight be some diabolical trap planned by Tarascus, but plunging headlong\r\ninto a snare was less abhorrent to Conan's temperament than sitting\r\nmeekly to await his doom. He inspected the weapon the girl had given\r\nhim, and smiled grimly. Whatever else she might be, she was proven by\r\nthat dagger to be a person of practical intelligence. It was no slender\r\nstiletto, selected because of a jeweled hilt or gold guard, fitted only\r\nfor dainty murder in milady's boudoir; it was a forthright poniard, a\r\nwarrior's weapon, broad-bladed, fifteen inches in length, tapering to a\r\ndiamond-sharp point.\r\n\r\nHe grunted with satisfaction. The feel of the hilt cheered him and gave\r\nhim a glow of confidence. Whatever webs of conspiracy were drawn about\r\nhim, whatever trickery and treachery ensnared him, this knife was real.\r\nThe great muscles of his right arm swelled in anticipation of murderous\r\nblows.\r\n\r\nHe tried the farther door, fumbling with the keys as he did so. It was\r\nnot locked. Yet he remembered the black man locking it. That furtive,\r\nbent figure, then, had been no jailer seeing that the bolts were in\r\nplace. He had unlocked the door, instead. There was a sinister\r\nsuggestion about that unlocked door. But Conan did not hesitate. He\r\npushed upon the grille and stepped from the dungeon into the outer\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nAs he had thought, the door did not open into another corridor. The\r\nflagged floor stretched away under his feet, and the line of cells ran\r\naway to the right and left behind him, but he could not make out the\r\nother limits of the place into which he had come. He could see neither\r\nthe roof nor any other wall. The moonlight filtered into that vastness\r\nonly through the grilles of the cells, and was almost lost in the\r\ndarkness. Less keen eyes than his could scarcely have discerned the dim\r\ngray patches that floated before each cell door.\r\n\r\nTurning to the left, he moved swiftly and noiselessly along the line of\r\ndungeons, his bare feet making no sound on the flags. He glanced briefly\r\ninto each dungeon as he passed it. They were all empty, but locked. In\r\nsome he caught the glimmer of naked white bones. These pits were a relic\r\nof a grimmer age, constructed long ago when Belverus was a fortress\r\nrather than a city. But evidently their more recent use had been more\r\nextensive than the world guessed.\r\n\r\nAhead of him, presently, he saw the dim outline of a stair sloping\r\nsharply upward, and knew it must be the stair he sought. Then he whirled\r\nsuddenly, crouching in the deep shadows at its foot.\r\n\r\nSomewhere behind him something was moving--something bulky and stealthy\r\nthat padded on feet which were not human feet. He was looking down the\r\nlong row of cells, before each one of which lay a square of dim gray\r\nlight that was little more than a patch of less dense darkness. But he\r\nsaw something moving along these squares. What it was he could not tell,\r\nbut it was heavy and huge, and yet it moved with more than human ease\r\nand swiftness. He glimpsed it as it moved across the squares of gray,\r\nthen lost it as it merged in the expanses of shadow between. It was\r\nuncanny, in its stealthy advance, appearing and disappearing like a blur\r\nof the vision.\r\n\r\nHe heard the bars rattle as it tried each door in turn. Now it had\r\nreached the cell he had so recently quitted, and the door swung open as\r\nit tugged. He saw a great bulky shape limned faintly and briefly in the\r\ngray doorway, and then the thing had vanished into the dungeon. Sweat\r\nbeaded Conan's face and hands. Now he knew why Tarascus had come so\r\nsubtly to his door, and later had fled so swiftly. The king had unlocked\r\nhis door, and, somewhere in these hellish pits, had opened a cell or\r\ncage that held some grim monstrosity.\r\n\r\nNow the thing was emerging from the cell and was again advancing up the\r\ncorridor, its misshapen head close to the ground. It paid no more heed\r\nto the locked doors. It was smelling out his trail. He saw it more\r\nplainly now; the gray light limned a giant anthropomorphic body, but\r\nvaster of bulk and girth than any man. It went on two legs, though it\r\nstooped forward, and it was grayish and shaggy, its thick coat shot with\r\nsilver. Its head was a grisly travesty of the human, its long arms hung\r\nnearly to the ground.\r\n\r\nConan knew it at last--understood the meaning of those crushed and\r\nbroken bones in the dungeon, and recognized the haunter of the pits. It\r\nwas a gray ape, one of the grisly man-eaters from the forests that wave\r\non the mountainous eastern shores of the Sea of Vilayet. Half mythical\r\nand altogether horrible, these apes were the goblins of Hyborian\r\nlegendry, and were in reality ogres of the natural world, cannibals and\r\nmurderers of the nighted forests.\r\n\r\nHe knew it scented his presence, for it was coming swiftly now, rolling\r\nits barrel-like body rapidly along on its short, mighty bowed legs. He\r\ncast a quick glance up the long stair, but knew that the thing would be\r\non his back before he could mount to the distant door. He chose to meet\r\nit face to face.\r\n\r\nConan stepped out into the nearest square of moonlight, so as to have\r\nall the advantage of illumination that he could; for the beast, he knew,\r\ncould see better than himself in the dark. Instantly the brute saw him;\r\nits great yellow tusks gleamed in the shadows, but it made no sound.\r\nCreatures of night and the silence, the gray apes of Vilayet were\r\nvoiceless. But in its dim, hideous features, which were a bestial\r\ntravesty of a human face, showed ghastly exultation.\r\n\r\nConan stood poised, watching the oncoming monster without a quiver. He\r\nknew he must stake his life on one thrust; there would be no chance for\r\nanother; nor would there be time to strike and spring away. The first\r\nblow must kill, and kill instantly, if he hoped to survive that awful\r\ngrapple. He swept his gaze over the short, squat throat, the hairy\r\nswagbelly, and the mighty breast, swelling in giant arches like twin\r\nshields. It must be the heart; better to risk the blade being deflected\r\nby the heavy ribs than to strike in where a stroke was not instantly\r\nfatal. With full realization of the odds, Conan matched his speed of eye\r\nand hand and his muscular power against the brute might and ferocity of\r\nthe man-eater. He must meet the brute breast to breast, strike a\r\ndeath-blow, and then trust to the ruggedness of his frame to survive the\r\ninstant of manhandling that was certain to be his.\r\n\r\nAs the ape came rolling in on him, swinging wide its terrible arms, he\r\nplunged in between them and struck with all his desperate power. He felt\r\nthe blade sink to the hilt in the hairy breast, and instantly, releasing\r\nit, he ducked his head and bunched his whole body into one compact mass\r\nof knotted muscles, and as he did so he grasped the closing arms and\r\ndrove his knee fiercely into the monster's belly, bracing himself\r\nagainst that crushing grapple.\r\n\r\nFor one dizzy instant he felt as if he were being dismembered in the\r\ngrip of an earthquake; then suddenly he was free, sprawling on the\r\nfloor, and the monster was gasping out its life beneath him, its red\r\neyes turned upward, the hilt of the poniard quivering in its breast. His\r\ndesperate stab had gone home.\r\n\r\nConan was panting as if after long conflict, trembling in every limb.\r\nSome of his joints felt as if they had been dislocated, and blood\r\ndripped from scratches on his skin where the monster's talons had\r\nripped; his muscles and tendons had been savagely wrenched and twisted.\r\nIf the beast had lived a second longer, it would surely have dismembered\r\nhim. But the Cimmerian's mighty strength had resisted, for the fleeting\r\ninstant it had endured, the dying convulsion of the ape that would have\r\ntorn a lesser man limb from limb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\nThe Thrust of a Knife\r\n\r\n\r\nConan stooped and tore the knife from the monster's breast. Then he went\r\nswiftly up the stair. What other shapes of fear the darkness held he\r\ncould not guess, but he had no desire to encounter any more. This\r\ntouch-and-go sort of battling was too strenuous even for the giant\r\nCimmerian. The moonlight was fading from the floor, the darkness closing\r\nin, and something like panic pursued him up the stair. He breathed a\r\ngusty sigh of relief when he reached the head, and felt the third key\r\nturn in the lock. He opened the door slightly, and craned his neck to\r\npeer through, half expecting an attack from some human or bestial enemy.\r\n\r\nHe looked into a bare stone corridor, dimly lighted, and a slender,\r\nsupple figure stood before the door.\r\n\r\n'Your Majesty!' It was a low, vibrant cry, half in relief and half in\r\nfear. The girl sprang to his side, then hesitated as if abashed.\r\n\r\n'You bleed,' she said. 'You have been hurt!'\r\n\r\nHe brushed aside the implication with an impatient hand.\r\n\r\n'Scratches that wouldn't hurt a baby. Your skewer came in handy, though.\r\nBut for it Tarascus' monkey would be cracking my shin-bones for the\r\nmarrow right now. But what now?'\r\n\r\n'Follow me,' she whispered. 'I will lead you outside the city wall. I\r\nhave a horse concealed there.'\r\n\r\nShe turned to lead the way down the corridor, but he laid a heavy hand\r\non her naked shoulder.\r\n\r\n'Walk beside me,' he instructed her softly, passing his massive arm\r\nabout her lithe waist. 'You've played me fair so far, and I'm inclined\r\nto believe in you; but I've lived this long only because I've trusted no\r\none too far, man or woman. So! Now if you play me false you won't live\r\nto enjoy the jest.'\r\n\r\nShe did not flinch at sight of the reddened poniard or the contact of\r\nhis hard muscles about her supple body.\r\n\r\n'Cut me down without mercy if I play you false,' she answered. 'The very\r\nfeel of your arm about me, even in menace, is as the fulfillment of a\r\ndream.'\r\n\r\nThe vaulted corridor ended at a door, which she opened. Outside lay\r\nanother black man, a giant in turban and silk loin-cloth, with a curved\r\nsword lying on the flags near his hand. He did not move.\r\n\r\n'I drugged his wine,' she whispered, swerving to avoid the recumbent\r\nfigure. 'He is the last, and outer, guard of the pits. None ever escaped\r\nfrom them before, and none has ever wished to seek them; so only these\r\nblack men guard them. Only these of all the servants knew it was King\r\nConan that Xaltotun brought a prisoner in his chariot. I was watching,\r\nsleepless, from an upper casement that opened into the court, while the\r\nother girls slept; for I knew that a battle was being fought, or had\r\nbeen fought, in the west, and I feared for you....\r\n\r\n'I saw the blacks carry you up the stair, and I recognized you in the\r\ntorchlight. I slipped into this wing of the palace tonight, in time to\r\nsee them carry you to the pits. I had not dared come here before\r\nnightfall. You must have lain in drugged senselessness all day in\r\nXaltotun's chamber.\r\n\r\n'Oh, let us be wary! Strange things are afoot in the palace tonight. The\r\nslaves said that Xaltotun slept as he often sleeps, drugged by the lotus\r\nof Stygia, but Tarascus is in the palace. He entered secretly, through\r\nthe postern, wrapped in his cloak which was dusty as with long travel,\r\nand attended only by his squire, the lean silent Arideus. I cannot\r\nunderstand, but I am afraid.'\r\n\r\nThey came out at the foot of a narrow, winding stair, and mounting it,\r\npassed through a narrow panel which she slid aside. When they had passed\r\nthrough, she slipped it back in place, and it became merely a portion of\r\nthe ornate wall. They were in a more spacious corridor, carpeted and\r\ntapestried, over which hanging lamps shed a golden glow.\r\n\r\nConan listened intently, but he heard no sound throughout the palace. He\r\ndid not know in what part of the palace he was, or in which direction\r\nlay the chamber of Xaltotun. The girl was trembling as she drew him\r\nalong the corridor, to halt presently beside an alcove masked with satin\r\ntapestry. Drawing this aside, she motioned for him to step into the\r\nniche, and whispered: 'Wait here! Beyond that door at the end of the\r\ncorridor we are likely to meet slaves or eunuchs at any time of the day\r\nor night. I will go and see if the way is clear, before we essay it.'\r\n\r\nInstantly his hair-trigger suspicions were aroused.\r\n\r\n'Are you leading me into a trap?'\r\n\r\nTears sprang into her dark eyes. She sank to her knees and seized his\r\nmuscular hand.\r\n\r\n'Oh, my king, do not mistrust me now!' Her voice shook with desperate\r\nurgency. 'If you doubt and hesitate, we are lost! Why should I bring you\r\nup out of the pits to betray you now?'\r\n\r\n'All right,' he muttered. 'I'll trust you; though, by Crom, the habits\r\nof a lifetime are not easily put aside. Yet I wouldn't harm you now, if\r\nyou brought all the swordsmen in Nemedia upon me. But for you Tarascus'\r\ncursed ape would have come upon me in chains and unarmed. Do as you\r\nwish, girl.'\r\n\r\nKissing his hands, she sprang lithely up and ran down the corridor, to\r\nvanish through a heavy double door.\r\n\r\nHe glanced after her, wondering if he was a fool to trust her; then he\r\nshrugged his mighty shoulders and pulled the satin hangings together,\r\nmasking his refuge. It was not strange that a passionate young beauty\r\nshould be risking her life to aid him; such things had happened often\r\nenough in his life. Many women had looked on him with favor, in the days\r\nof his wanderings, and in the time of his kingship.\r\n\r\nYet he did not remain motionless in the alcove, waiting for her return.\r\nFollowing his instincts, he explored the niche for another exit, and\r\npresently found one--the opening of a narrow passage, masked by the\r\ntapestries, that ran to an ornately carved door, barely visible in the\r\ndim light that filtered in from the outer corridor. And as he stared\r\ninto it, somewhere beyond that carven door he heard the sound of another\r\ndoor opening and shutting, and then a low mumble of voices. The familiar\r\nsound of one of those voices caused a sinister expression to cross his\r\ndark face. Without hesitation he glided down the passage, and crouched\r\nlike a stalking panther beside the door. It was not locked, and\r\nmanipulating it delicately, he pushed it open a crack, with a reckless\r\ndisregard for possible consequences that only he could have explained or\r\ndefended.\r\n\r\nIt was masked on the other side by tapestries, but through a thin slit\r\nin the velvet he looked into a chamber lit by a candle on an ebony\r\ntable. There were two men in that chamber. One was a scarred,\r\nsinister-looking ruffian in leather breeks and ragged cloak; the other\r\nwas Tarascus, king of Nemedia.\r\n\r\nTarascus seemed ill at ease. He was slightly pale, and he kept starting\r\nand glancing about him, as if expecting and fearing to hear some sound\r\nor footstep.\r\n\r\n'Go swiftly and at once,' he was saying. 'He is deep in drugged slumber,\r\nbut I know not when he may awaken.'\r\n\r\n'Strange to hear words of fear issuing from the lips of Tarascus,'\r\nrumbled the other in a harsh, deep voice.\r\n\r\nThe king frowned.\r\n\r\n'I fear no common man, as you well know. But when I saw the cliffs fall\r\nat Valkia I knew that this devil we had resurrected was no charlatan. I\r\nfear his powers, because I do not know the full extent of them. But I\r\nknow that somehow they are connected with this accursed thing which I\r\nhave stolen from him. It brought him back to life; so it must be the\r\nsource of his sorcery.\r\n\r\n'He had it hidden well; but following my secret order a slave spied on\r\nhim and saw him place it in a golden chest, and saw where he hid the\r\nchest. Even so, I would not have dared steal it had Xaltotun himself not\r\nbeen sunk in lotus slumber.\r\n\r\n'I believe it is the secret of his power. With it Orastes brought him\r\nback to life. With it he will make us all slaves, if we are not wary. So\r\ntake it and cast it into the sea as I have bidden you. And be sure you\r\nare so far from land that neither tide nor storm can wash it up on the\r\nbeach. You have been paid.'\r\n\r\n'So I have,' grunted the ruffian. 'And I owe more than gold to you,\r\nking; I owe you a debt of gratitude. Even thieves can be grateful.'\r\n\r\n'Whatever debt you may feel you owe me,' answered Tarascus, 'will be\r\npaid when you have hurled this thing into the sea.'\r\n\r\n'I'll ride for Zingara and take ship from Kordava,' promised the other.\r\n'I dare not show my head in Argos, because of the matter of a murder or\r\nso--'\r\n\r\n'I care not, so it is done. Here it is; a horse awaits you in the court.\r\nGo, and go swiftly!'\r\n\r\nSomething passed between them, something that flamed like living fire.\r\nConan had only a brief glimpse of it; and then the ruffian pulled a\r\nslouch hat over his eyes, drew his cloak about his shoulder, and hurried\r\nfrom the chamber. And as the door closed behind him, Conan moved with\r\nthe devastating fury of unchained blood-lust. He had held himself in\r\ncheck so long as he could. The sight of his enemy so near him set his\r\nwild blood seething and swept away all caution and restraint.\r\n\r\nTarascus was turning toward an inner door when Conan tore aside the\r\nhangings and leaped like a blood-mad panther into the room. Tarascus\r\nwheeled, but even before he could recognize his attacker, Conan's\r\nponiard ripped into him.\r\n\r\nBut the blow was not mortal, as Conan knew the instant he struck. His\r\nfoot had caught in a fold of the curtains and tripped him as he leaped.\r\nThe point fleshed itself in Tarascus' shoulder and plowed down along his\r\nribs, and the king of Nemedia screamed.\r\n\r\nThe impact of the blow and Conan's lunging body hurled him back against\r\nthe table and it toppled and the candle went out. They were both carried\r\nto the floor by the violence of Conan's rush, and the foot of the\r\ntapestry hampered them both in its folds. Conan was stabbing blindly in\r\nthe dark, Tarascus screaming in a frenzy of panicky terror. As if fear\r\nlent him superhuman energy, Tarascus tore free and blundered away in the\r\ndarkness, shrieking: 'Help! Guards! Arideus! Orastes! Orastes!'\r\n\r\nConan rose, kicking himself free of the tangling tapestries and the\r\nbroken table, cursing with the bitterness of his blood-thirsty\r\ndisappointment. He was confused, and ignorant of the plan of the palace.\r\nThe yells of Tarascus were still resounding in the distance, and a wild\r\noutcry was bursting forth in answer. The Nemedian had escaped him in the\r\ndarkness, and Conan did not know which way he had gone. The Cimmerian's\r\nrash stroke for vengeance had failed, and there remained only the task\r\nof saving his own hide if he could.\r\n\r\nSwearing luridly, Conan ran back down the passage and into the alcove,\r\nglaring out into the lighted corridor, just as Zenobia came running up\r\nit, her dark eyes dilated with terror.\r\n\r\n'Oh, what has happened?' she cried. 'The palace is roused! I swear I\r\nhave not betrayed you--'\r\n\r\n'No, it was I who stirred up this hornet's nest,' he grunted. 'I tried\r\nto pay off a score. What's the shortest way out of this?'\r\n\r\nShe caught his wrist and ran fleetly down the corridor. But before they\r\nreached the heavy door at the other end, muffled shouts arose from\r\nbehind it and the portals began to shake under an assault from the other\r\nside. Zenobia wrung her hands and whimpered.\r\n\r\n'We are cut off! I locked that door as I returned through it. But they\r\nwill burst it in a moment. The way to the postern gate lies through it.'\r\n\r\nConan wheeled. Up the corridor, though still out of sight, he heard a\r\nrising clamor that told him his foes were behind as well as before him.\r\n\r\n'Quick! Into this door!' the girl cried desperately, running across the\r\ncorridor and throwing open the door of a chamber.\r\n\r\nConan followed her through, and then threw the gold catch behind them.\r\nThey stood in an ornately furnished chamber, empty but for themselves,\r\nand she drew him to a gold-barred window, through which he saw trees and\r\nshrubbery.\r\n\r\n'You are strong,' she panted. 'If you can tear these bars away, you may\r\nyet escape. The garden is full of guards, but the shrubs are thick, and\r\nyou may avoid them. The southern wall is also the outer wall of the\r\ncity. Once over that, you have a chance to get away. A horse is hidden\r\nfor you in a thicket beside the road that runs westward, a few hundred\r\npaces to the south of the fountain of Thrallos. You know where it is?'\r\n\r\n'Aye! But what of you? I had meant to take you with me.'\r\n\r\nA flood of joy lighted her beautiful face.\r\n\r\n'Then my cup of happiness is brimming! But I will not hamper your\r\nescape. Burdened with me you would fail. Nay, do not fear for me. They\r\nwill never suspect that I aided you willingly. Go! What you have just\r\nsaid will glorify my life throughout the long years.'\r\n\r\nHe caught her up in his iron arms, crushed her slim, vibrant figure to\r\nhim and kissed her fiercely on eyes, cheeks, throat and lips, until she\r\nlay panting in his embrace; gusty and tempestuous as a storm-wind, even\r\nhis love-making was violent.\r\n\r\n'I'll go,' he muttered. 'But by Crom, I'll come for you some day!'\r\n\r\nWheeling, he gripped the gold bars and tore them from their sockets with\r\none tremendous wrench; threw a leg over the sill and went down swiftly,\r\nclinging to the ornaments on the wall. He hit the ground running and\r\nmelted like a shadow into the maze of towering rose-bushes and spreading\r\ntrees. The one look he cast back over his shoulder showed him Zenobia\r\nleaning over the window-sill, her arms stretched after him in mute\r\nfarewell and renunciation.\r\n\r\nGuards were running through the garden, all converging toward the\r\npalace, where the clamor momentarily grew louder--tall men in burnished\r\ncuirasses and crested helmets of polished bronze. The starlight struck\r\nglints from their gleaming armor, among the trees, betraying their every\r\nmovement; but the sound of their coming ran far before them. To Conan,\r\nwilderness-bred, their rush through the shrubbery was like the\r\nblundering stampede of cattle. Some of them passed within a few feet of\r\nwhere he lay flat in a thick cluster of bushes, and never guessed his\r\npresence. With the palace as their goal, they were oblivious to all else\r\nabout them. When they had gone shouting on, he rose and fled through the\r\ngarden with no more noise than a panther would have made.\r\n\r\nSo quickly he came to the southern wall, and mounted the steps that led\r\nto the parapet. The wall was made to keep people out, not in. No sentry\r\npatrolling the battlements was in sight. Crouching by an embrasure he\r\nglanced back at the great palace rearing above the cypresses behind him.\r\nLights blazed from every window, and he could see figures flitting back\r\nand forth across them like puppets on invisible strings. He grinned\r\nhardly, shook his fist in a gesture of farewell and menace, and let\r\nhimself over the outer rim of the parapet.\r\n\r\nA low tree, a few yards below the parapet, received Conan's weight, as\r\nhe dropped noiselessly into the branches. An instant later he was racing\r\nthrough the shadows with the swinging hillman's stride that eats up long\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nGardens and pleasure villas surrounded the walls of Belverus. Drowsy\r\nslaves, sleeping by their watchman's pikes, did not see the swift and\r\nfurtive figure that scaled walls, crossed alleys made by the arching\r\nbranches of trees, and threaded a noiseless way through orchards and\r\nvineyards. Watchdogs woke and lifted their deep-booming clamor at a\r\ngliding shadow, half scented, half sensed, and then it was gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a chamber of the palace Tarascus writhed and cursed on a\r\nblood-spattered couch, under the deft, quick fingers of Orastes. The\r\npalace was thronged with wide-eyed, trembling servitors, but the chamber\r\nwhere the king lay was empty save for himself and the renegade priest.\r\n\r\n'Are you sure he still sleeps?' Tarascus demanded again, setting his\r\nteeth against the bite of the herb juices with which Orastes was\r\nbandaging the long, ragged gash in his shoulder and ribs. 'Ishtar, Mitra\r\nand Set! That burns like molten pitch of hell!'\r\n\r\n'Which you would be experiencing even now, but for your good fortune,'\r\nremarked Orastes. 'Whoever wielded that knife struck to kill. Yes, I\r\nhave told you that Xaltotun still sleeps. Why are you so urgent upon\r\nthat point? What has he to do with this?'\r\n\r\n'You know nothing of what has passed in the palace tonight?' Tarascus\r\nsearched the priest's countenance with burning intensity.\r\n\r\n'Nothing. As you know, I have been employed in translating manuscripts\r\nfor Xaltotun, for some months now, transcribing esoteric volumes written\r\nin the younger languages into script he can read. He was well versed in\r\nall the tongues and scripts of his day, but he has not yet learned all\r\nthe newer languages, and to save time he has me translate these works\r\nfor him, to learn if any new knowledge has been discovered since his\r\ntime. I did not know that he had returned last night until he sent for\r\nme and told me of the battle. Then I returned to my studies, nor did I\r\nknow that you had returned until the clamor in the palace brought me out\r\nof my cell.'\r\n\r\n'Then you do not know that Xaltotun brought the king of Aquilonia a\r\ncaptive to this palace?'\r\n\r\nOrastes shook his head, without particular surprise.\r\n\r\n'Xaltotun merely said that Conan would oppose us no more. I supposed\r\nthat he had fallen, but did not ask the details.'\r\n\r\n'Xaltotun saved his life when I would have slain him,' snarled Tarascus.\r\n'I saw his purpose instantly. He would hold Conan captive to use as a\r\nclub against us--against Amalric, against Valerius, and against myself.\r\nSo long as Conan lives he is a threat, a unifying factor for Aquilonia,\r\nthat might be used to compel us into courses we would not otherwise\r\nfollow. I mistrust this undead Pythonian. Of late I have begun to fear\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'I followed him, some hours after he had departed eastward. I wished to\r\nlearn what he intended doing with Conan. I found that he had imprisoned\r\nhim in the pits. I intended to see that the barbarian died, in spite of\r\nXaltotun. And I accomplished----'\r\n\r\nA cautious knock sounded at the door.\r\n\r\n'That's Arideus,' grunted Tarascus. 'Let him in.'\r\n\r\nThe saturnine squire entered, his eyes blazing with suppressed\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\n'How, Arideus?' exclaimed Tarascus. 'Have you found the man who attacked\r\nme?'\r\n\r\n'You did not see him, my lord?' asked Arideus, as one who would assure\r\nhimself of a fact he already knows to exist. 'You did not recognize\r\nhim?'\r\n\r\n'No. It happened so quick, and the candle was out--all I could think of\r\nwas that it was some devil loosed on me by Xaltotun's magic----'\r\n\r\n'The Pythonian sleeps in his barred and bolted room. But I have been in\r\nthe pits.' Arideus twitched his lean shoulders excitedly.\r\n\r\n'Well, speak, man!' exclaimed Tarascus impatiently. 'What did you find\r\nthere?'\r\n\r\n'An empty dungeon,' whispered the squire. 'The corpse of the great ape!'\r\n\r\n'_What?_' Tarascus started upright, and blood gushed from his opened\r\nwound.\r\n\r\n'Aye! The man-eater is dead--stabbed through the heart--and Conan is\r\ngone!'\r\n\r\nTarascus was gray of face as he mechanically allowed Orastes to force\r\nhim prostrate again and the priest renewed work upon his mangled flesh.\r\n\r\n'Conan!' he repeated. 'Not a crushed corpse--escaped! Mitra! He is no\r\nman; but a devil himself! I thought Xaltotun was behind this wound. I\r\nsee now. Gods and devils! It was Conan who stabbed me! Arideus!'\r\n\r\n'Aye, your Majesty!'\r\n\r\n'Search every nook in the palace. He may be skulking through the dark\r\ncorridors now like a hungry tiger. Let no niche escape your scrutiny,\r\nand beware. It is not a civilized man you hunt, but a blood-mad\r\nbarbarian whose strength and ferocity are those of a wild beast. Scour\r\nthe palace-grounds and the city. Throw a cordon about the walls. If you\r\nfind he has escaped from the city, as he may well do, take a troop of\r\nhorsemen and follow him. Once past the walls it will be like hunting a\r\nwolf through the hills. But haste, and you may yet catch him.'\r\n\r\n'This is a matter which requires more than ordinary human wits,' said\r\nOrastes. 'Perhaps we should seek Xaltotun's advice.'\r\n\r\n'No!' exclaimed Tarascus violently. 'Let the troopers pursue Conan and\r\nslay him. Xaltotun can hold no grudge against us if we kill a prisoner\r\nto prevent his escape.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Orastes, 'I am no Acheronian, but I am versed in some of\r\nthe arts, and the control of certain spirits which have cloaked\r\nthemselves in material substance. Perhaps I can aid you in this matter.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fountain of Thrallos stood in a clustered ring of oaks beside the\r\nroad a mile from the walls of the city. Its musical tinkle reached\r\nConan's ears through the silence of the starlight. He drank deep of its\r\nicy stream, and then hurried southward toward a small, dense thicket he\r\nsaw there. Rounding it, he saw a great white horse tied among the\r\nbushes. Heaving a deep gusty sigh he reached it with one stride--a\r\nmocking laugh brought him about, glaring.\r\n\r\nA dully glinting, mail-clad figure moved out of the shadows into the\r\nstarlight. This was no plumed and burnished palace guardsman. It was a\r\ntall man in morion and gray chain-mail--one of the Adventurers, a class\r\nof warriors peculiar to Nemedia; men who had not attained to the wealth\r\nand position of knighthood, or had fallen from that estate; hard-bitten\r\nfighters, dedicating their lives to war and adventure. They constituted\r\na class of their own, sometimes commanding troops, but themselves\r\naccountable to no man but the king. Conan knew that he could have been\r\ndiscovered by no more dangerous a foeman.\r\n\r\nA quick glance among the shadows convinced him that the man was alone,\r\nand he expanded his great chest slightly, digging his toes into the\r\nturf, as his thews coiled tensely.\r\n\r\n'I was riding for Belverus on Amalric's business,' said the Adventurer,\r\nadvancing warily. The starlight was a long sheen on the great two-handed\r\nsword he bore naked in his hand. 'A horse whinnied to mine from the\r\nthicket. I investigated and thought it strange a steed should be\r\ntethered here. I waited--and lo, I have caught a rare prize!'\r\n\r\nThe Adventurers lived by their swords.\r\n\r\n'I know you,' muttered the Nemedian. 'You are Conan, king of Aquilonia.\r\nI thought I saw you die in the valley of the Valkia, but----'\r\n\r\nConan sprang as a dying tiger springs. Practised fighter though the\r\nAdventurer was, he did not realize the desperate quickness that lurks in\r\nbarbaric sinews. He was caught off guard, his heavy sword half lifted.\r\nBefore he could either strike or parry, the king's poniard sheathed\r\nitself in his throat, above the gorget, slanting downward into his\r\nheart. With a choked gurgle he reeled and went down, and Conan\r\nruthlessly tore his blade free as his victim fell. The white horse\r\nsnorted violently and shied at the sight and scent of blood on the\r\nsword.\r\n\r\nGlaring down at his lifeless enemy, dripping poniard in hand, sweat\r\nglistening on his broad breast, Conan poised like a statue, listening\r\nintently. In the woods about there was no sound, save for the sleepy\r\ncheep of awakened birds. But in the city, a mile away, he heard the\r\nstrident blare of a trumpet.\r\n\r\nHastily he bent over the fallen man. A few seconds' search convinced him\r\nthat whatever message the man might have borne was intended to be\r\nconveyed by word of mouth. But he did not pause in his task. It was not\r\nmany hours until dawn. A few minutes later the white horse was galloping\r\nwestward along the white road, and the rider wore the gray mail of a\r\nNemedian Adventurer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\nThe Rending of the Veil\r\n\r\n\r\nConan knew his only chance of escape lay in speed. He did not even\r\nconsider hiding somewhere near Belverus until the chase passed on; he\r\nwas certain that the uncanny ally of Tarascus would be able to ferret\r\nhim out. Besides, he was not one to skulk and hide; an open fight or an\r\nopen chase, either suited his temperament better. He had a long start,\r\nhe knew. He would lead them a grinding race for the border.\r\n\r\nZenobia had chosen well in selecting the white horse. His speed,\r\ntoughness and endurance were obvious. The girl knew weapons and horses,\r\nand, Conan reflected with some satisfaction, she knew men. He rode\r\nwestward at a gait that ate up the miles.\r\n\r\nIt was a sleeping land through which he rode, past grove-sheltered\r\nvillages and white-walled villas amid spacious fields and orchards that\r\ngrew sparser as he fared westward. As the villages thinned, the land\r\ngrew more rugged, and the keeps that frowned from eminences told of\r\ncenturies of border war. But none rode down from those castles to\r\nchallenge or halt him. The lords of the keeps were following the banner\r\nof Amalric; the pennons that were wont to wave over these towers were\r\nnow floating over the Aquilonian plains.\r\n\r\nWhen the last huddled village fell behind him, Conan left the road,\r\nwhich was beginning to bend toward the northwest, toward the distant\r\npasses. To keep to the road would mean to pass by border towers, still\r\ngarrisoned with armed men who would not allow him to pass unquestioned.\r\nHe knew there would be no patrols riding the border marches on either\r\nside, as in ordinary times, but there were those towers, and with dawn\r\nthere would probably be cavalcades of returning soldiers with wounded\r\nmen in ox-carts.\r\n\r\nThis road from Belverus was the only road that crossed the border for\r\nfifty miles from north to south. It followed a series of passes through\r\nthe hills, and on either hand lay a wide expanse of wild, sparsely\r\ninhabited mountains. He maintained his due westerly direction, intending\r\nto cross the border deep in the wilds of the hills that lay to the south\r\nof the passes. It was a shorter route, more arduous, but safer for a\r\nhunted fugitive. One man on a horse could traverse country an army would\r\nfind impassable.\r\n\r\nBut at dawn he had not reached the hills; they were a long, low, blue\r\nrampart stretching along the horizon ahead of him. Here there were\r\nneither farms nor villages, no white-walled villas looming among\r\nclustering trees. The dawn wind stirred the tall stiff grass, and there\r\nwas nothing but the long rolling swells of brown earth, covered with dry\r\ngrass, and in the distance the gaunt walls of a stronghold on a low\r\nhill. Too many Aquilonian raiders had crossed the mountains in not too\r\ndistant days for the countryside to be thickly settled as it was farther\r\nto the east.\r\n\r\nDawn ran like a prairie fire across the grasslands, and high overhead\r\nsounded a weird crying as a straggling wedge of wild geese winged\r\nswiftly southward. In a grassy swale Conan halted and unsaddled his\r\nmount. Its sides were heaving, its coat plastered with sweat. He had\r\npushed it unmercifully through the hours before dawn.\r\n\r\nWhile it munched the brittle grass and rolled, he lay at the crest of\r\nthe low slope, staring eastward. Far away to the northward he could see\r\nthe road he had left, streaming like a white ribbon over a distant rise.\r\nNo black dots moved along that glistening ribbon. There was no sign\r\nabout the castle in the distance to indicate that the keepers had\r\nnoticed the lone wayfarer.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the land still stretched bare. The only sign of life was a\r\nglint of steel on the far-off battlements, a raven in the sky that\r\nwheeled backward and forth, dipping and rising as if seeking something.\r\nConan saddled and rode westward at a more leisurely gait.\r\n\r\nAs he topped the farther crest of the slope, a raucous screaming burst\r\nout over his head, and looking up, he saw the raven flapping high above\r\nhim, cawing incessantly. As he rode on, it followed him, maintaining its\r\nposition and making the morning hideous with its strident cries,\r\nheedless of his efforts to drive it away.\r\n\r\nThis kept up for hours, until Conan's teeth were on edge, and he felt\r\nthat he would give half his kingdom to be allowed to wring that black\r\nneck.\r\n\r\n'Devils of hell!' he roared in futile rage, shaking his mailed fist at\r\nthe frantic bird. 'Why do you harry me with your squawking? Begone, you\r\nblack spawn of perdition, and peck for wheat in the farmer's fields!'\r\n\r\nHe was ascending the first pitch of the hills, and he seemed to hear an\r\necho of the bird's clamor far behind him. Turning in his saddle, he\r\npresently made out another black dot hanging in the blue. Beyond that\r\nagain he caught the glint of the afternoon sun on steel. That could mean\r\nonly one thing: armed men. And they were not riding along the beaten\r\nroad, which was out of his sight beyond the horizon. They were following\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis face grew grim and he shivered slightly as he stared at the raven\r\nthat wheeled high above him.\r\n\r\n'So it is more than the whim of a brainless beast?' he muttered. 'Those\r\nriders cannot see you, spawn of hell; but the other bird can see you,\r\nand they can see him. You follow me, he follows you, and they follow\r\nhim. Are you only a craftily trained feathered creature, or some devil\r\nin the form of a bird? Did Xaltotun set you on my trail? Are you\r\nXaltotun?'\r\n\r\nOnly a strident screech answered him, a screech vibrating with harsh\r\nmockery.\r\n\r\nConan wasted no more breath on his dusky betrayer. Grimly he settled to\r\nthe long grind of the hills. He dared not push the horse too hard; the\r\nrest he had allowed it had not been enough to freshen it. He was still\r\nfar ahead of his pursuers, but they would cut down that lead steadily.\r\nIt was almost a certainty that their horses were fresher than his, for\r\nthey had undoubtedly changed mounts at that castle he had passed.\r\n\r\nThe going grew rougher, the scenery more rugged, steep grassy slopes\r\npitching up to densely timbered mountainsides. Here, he knew, he might\r\nelude his hunters, but for that hellish bird that squalled incessantly\r\nabove him. He could no longer see them in this broken country, but he\r\nwas certain that they still followed him, guided unerringly by their\r\nfeathered allies. That black shape became like a demoniac incubus,\r\nhounding him through measureless hells. The stones he hurled with a\r\ncurse went wide or fell harmless, though in his youth he had felled\r\nhawks on the wing.\r\n\r\nThe horse was tiring fast. Conan recognized the grim finality of his\r\nposition. He sensed an inexorable driving fate behind all this. He could\r\nnot escape. He was as much a captive as he had been in the pits of\r\nBelverus. But he was no son of the Orient to yield passively to what\r\nseemed inevitable. If he could not escape, he would at least take some\r\nof his foes into eternity with him. He turned into a wide thicket of\r\nlarches that masked a slope, looking for a place to turn at bay.\r\n\r\nThen ahead of him there rang a strange, shrill scream, human yet weirdly\r\ntimbred. An instant later he had pushed through a screen of branches,\r\nand saw the source of that eldritch cry. In a small glade below him four\r\nsoldiers in Nemedian chain-mail were binding a noose about the neck of a\r\ngaunt old woman in peasant garb. A heap of fagots, bound with cord on\r\nthe ground near by, showed what her occupation had been when surprised\r\nby these stragglers.\r\n\r\nConan felt slow fury swell his heart as he looked silently down and saw\r\nthe ruffians dragging her toward a tree whose low-spreading branches\r\nwere obviously intended to act as a gibbet. He had crossed the frontier\r\nan hour ago. He was standing on his own soil, watching the murder of one\r\nof his own subjects. The old woman was struggling with surprising\r\nstrength and energy, and as he watched, she lifted her head and voiced\r\nagain the strange, weird, far-carrying call he had heard before. It was\r\nechoed as if in mockery by the raven flapping above the trees. The\r\nsoldiers laughed roughly, and one struck her in the mouth.\r\n\r\nConan swung from his weary steed and dropped down the face of the rocks,\r\nlanding with a clang of mail on the grass. The four men wheeled at the\r\nsound and drew their swords, gaping at the mailed giant who faced them,\r\nsword in hand.\r\n\r\nConan laughed harshly. His eyes were bleak as flint.\r\n\r\n'Dogs!' he said without passion and without mercy. 'Do Nemedian jackals\r\nset themselves up as executioners and hang my subjects at will? First\r\nyou must take the head of their king. Here I stand, awaiting your lordly\r\npleasure!'\r\n\r\nThe soldiers stared at him uncertainly as he strode toward them.\r\n\r\n'Who is this madman?' growled a bearded ruffian. 'He wears Nemedian\r\nmail, but speaks with an Aquilonian accent.'\r\n\r\n'No matter,' quoth another. 'Cut him down, and then we'll hang the old\r\nhag.'\r\n\r\nAnd so saying he ran at Conan, lifting his sword. But before he could\r\nstrike, the king's great blade lashed down, splitting helmet and skull.\r\nThe man fell before him, but the others were hardy rogues. They gave\r\ntongue like wolves and surged about the lone figure in the gray mail,\r\nand the clamor and din of steel drowned the cries of the circling raven.\r\n\r\nConan did not shout. His eyes coals of blue fire and his lips smiling\r\nbleakly, he lashed right and left with his two-handed sword. For all his\r\nsize he was quick as a cat on his feet, and he was constantly in motion,\r\npresenting a moving target so that thrusts and swings cut empty air\r\noftener than not. Yet when he struck he was perfectly balanced, and his\r\nblows fell with devastating power. Three of the four were down, dying in\r\ntheir own blood, and the fourth was bleeding from half a dozen wounds,\r\nstumbling in headlong retreat as he parried frantically, when Conan's\r\nspur caught in the surcoat of one of the fallen men.\r\n\r\nThe king stumbled, and before he could catch himself the Nemedian, with\r\nthe frenzy of desperation, rushed him so savagely that Conan staggered\r\nand fell sprawling over the corpse. The Nemedian croaked in triumph and\r\nsprang forward, lifting his great sword with both hands over his right\r\nshoulder, as he braced his legs wide for the stroke--and then, over the\r\nprostrate king, something huge and hairy shot like a thunderbolt full on\r\nthe soldier's breast, and his yelp of triumph changed to a shriek of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nConan, scrambling up, saw the man lying dead with his throat torn out,\r\nand a great gray wolf stood over him, head sunk as it smelled the blood\r\nthat formed a pool on the grass.\r\n\r\nThe king turned as the old woman spoke to him. She stood straight and\r\ntall before him, and in spite of her ragged garb, her features,\r\nclear-cut and aquiline, and her keen black eyes, were not those of a\r\ncommon peasant woman. She called to the wolf and it trotted to her side\r\nlike a great dog and rubbed its giant shoulder against her knee, while\r\nit gazed at Conan with great green lambent eyes. Absently she laid her\r\nhand upon its mighty neck, and so the two stood regarding the king of\r\nAquilonia. He found their steady gaze disquieting, though there was no\r\nhostility in it.\r\n\r\n'Men say King Conan died beneath the stones and dirt when the cliffs\r\ncrumbled by Valkia,' she said in a deep, strong, resonant voice.\r\n\r\n'So they say,' he growled. He was in no mood for controversy, and he\r\nthought of those armored riders who were pushing nearer every moment.\r\nThe raven above him cawed stridently, and he cast an involuntary glare\r\nupward, grinding his teeth in a spasm of nervous irritation.\r\n\r\nUp on the ledge the white horse stood with drooping head. The old woman\r\nlooked at it, and then at the raven; and then she lifted a strange weird\r\ncry as she had before. As if recognizing the call, the raven wheeled,\r\nsuddenly mute, and raced eastward. But before it had got out of sight,\r\nthe shadow of mighty wings fell across it. An eagle soared up from the\r\ntangle of trees, and rising above it, swooped and struck the black\r\nmessenger to the earth. The strident voice of betrayal was stilled for\r\never.\r\n\r\n'Crom!' muttered Conan, staring at the old woman. 'Are you a magician,\r\ntoo?'\r\n\r\n'I am Zelata,' she said. 'The people of the valleys call me a witch. Was\r\nthat child of the night guiding armed men on your trail?'\r\n\r\n'Aye.' She did not seem to think the answer fantastic. 'They cannot be\r\nfar behind me.'\r\n\r\n'Lead your horse and follow me, King Conan,' she said briefly.\r\n\r\nWithout comment he mounted the rocks and brought his horse down to the\r\nglade by a circuitous path. As he came he saw the eagle reappear,\r\ndropping lazily down from the sky, and rest an instant on Zelata's\r\nshoulder, spreading its great wings lightly so as not to crush her with\r\nits weight.\r\n\r\nWithout a word she led the way, the great wolf trotting at her side, the\r\neagle soaring above her. Through deep thickets and along tortuous ledges\r\npoised over deep ravines she led him, and finally along a narrow\r\nprecipice-edged path to a curious dwelling of stone, half hut, half\r\ncavern, beneath a cliff hidden among the gorges and crags. The eagle\r\nflew to the pinnacle of this cliff, and perched there like a motionless\r\nsentinel.\r\n\r\nStill silent, Zelata stabled the horse in a near-by cave, with leaves\r\nand grass piled high for provender, and a tiny spring bubbling in the\r\ndim recesses.\r\n\r\nIn the hut she seated the king on a rude, hide-covered bench, and she\r\nherself sat upon a low stool before the tiny fireplace, while she made a\r\nfire of tamarisk chunks and prepared a frugal meal. The great wolf\r\ndrowsed beside her, facing the fire, his huge head sunk on his paws, his\r\nears twitching in his dreams.\r\n\r\n'You do not fear to sit in the hut of a witch?' she asked, breaking her\r\nsilence at last.\r\n\r\nAn impatient shrug of his gray-mailed shoulders was her guest's only\r\nreply. She gave into his hands a wooden dish heaped with dried fruits,\r\ncheese and barley bread, and a great pot of the heady upland beer,\r\nbrewed from barley grown in the high valleys.\r\n\r\n'I have found the brooding silence of the glens more pleasing than the\r\nbabble of city streets,' she said. 'The children of the wild are kinder\r\nthan the children of men.' Her hand briefly stroked the ruff of the\r\nsleeping wolf. 'My children were afar from me today, or I had not needed\r\nyour sword, my king. They were coming at my call.'\r\n\r\n'What grudge had those Nemedian dogs against you?' Conan demanded.\r\n\r\n'Skulkers from the invading army straggle all over the countryside, from\r\nthe frontier to Tarantia,' she answered. 'The foolish villagers in the\r\nvalleys told them that I had a store of gold hidden away, so as to\r\ndivert their attentions from their villages. They demanded treasure from\r\nme, and my answers angered them. But neither skulkers nor the men who\r\npursue you, nor any raven will find you here.'\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, eating ravenously.\r\n\r\n'I'm for Tarantia.'\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\n'You thrust your head into the dragon's jaws. Best seek refuge abroad.\r\nThe heart is gone from your kingdom.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' he demanded. 'Battles have been lost before, yet\r\nwars won. A kingdom is not lost by a single defeat.'\r\n\r\n'And you will go to Tarantia?'\r\n\r\n'Aye. Prospero will be holding it against Amalric.'\r\n\r\n'Are you sure?'\r\n\r\n'Hell's devils, woman!' he exclaimed wrathfully. 'What else?'\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. 'I feel that it is otherwise. Let us see. Not\r\nlightly is the veil rent; yet I will rend it a little, and show you your\r\ncapital city.'\r\n\r\nConan did not see what she cast upon the fire, but the wolf whimpered in\r\nhis dreams, and a green smoke gathered and billowed up into the hut. And\r\nas he watched, the walls and ceiling of the hut seemed to widen, to grow\r\nremote and vanish, merging with infinite immensities; the smoke rolled\r\nabout him, blotting out everything. And in it forms moved and faded, and\r\nstood out in startling clarity.\r\n\r\nHe stared at the familiar towers and streets of Tarantia, where a mob\r\nseethed and screamed, and at the same time he was somehow able to see\r\nthe banners of Nemedia moving inexorably westward through the smoke and\r\nflame of a pillaged land. In the great square of Tarantia the frantic\r\nthrong milled and yammered, screaming that the king was dead, that the\r\nbarons were girding themselves to divide the land between them, and that\r\nthe rule of a king, even of Valerius, was better than anarchy. Prospero,\r\nshining in his armor, rode among them, trying to pacify them, bidding\r\nthem trust Count Trocero, urging them to man the wall and aid his\r\nknights in defending the city. They turned on him, shrieking with fear\r\nand unreasoning rage, howling that he was Trocero's butcher, a more evil\r\nfoe than Amalric himself. Offal and stones were hurled at his knights.\r\n\r\nA slight blurring of the picture, that might have denoted a passing of\r\ntime, and then Conan saw Prospero and his knights filing out of the\r\ngates and spurring southward. Behind him the city was in an uproar.\r\n\r\n'Fools!' muttered Conan thickly. 'Fools! Why could they not trust\r\nProspero? Zelata, if you are making game of me, with some trickery----'\r\n\r\n'This has passed,' answered Zelata imperturbably, though somberly. 'It\r\nwas the evening of the day that has passed when Prospero rode out of\r\nTarantia, with the hosts of Amalric almost within sight. From the walls\r\nmen saw the flame of their pillaging. So I read it in the smoke. At\r\nsunset the Nemedians rode into Tarantia, unopposed. Look! Even now, in\r\nthe royal hall of Tarantia----'\r\n\r\nAbruptly Conan was looking into the great coronation hall. Valerius\r\nstood on the regal dais, clad in ermine robes, and Amalric, still in his\r\ndusty, blood-stained armor, placed a rich and gleaming circlet on his\r\nyellow locks--the crown of Aquilonia! The people cheered; long lines of\r\nsteel-clad Nemedian warriors looked grimly on, and nobles long in\r\ndisfavor at Conan's court strutted and swaggered with the emblem of\r\nValerius on their sleeves.\r\n\r\n'Crom!' It was an explosive imprecation from Conan's lips as he started\r\nup, his great fists clenched into hammers, his veins on his temples\r\nknotting, his features convulsed. 'A Nemedian placing the crown of\r\nAquilonia on that renegade--in the royal hall of Tarantia!'\r\n\r\nAs if dispelled by his violence, the smoke faded, and he saw Zelata's\r\nblack eyes gleaming at him through the mist.\r\n\r\n'You have seen--the people of your capital have forfeited the freedom\r\nyou won for them by sweat and blood; they have sold themselves to the\r\nslavers and the butchers. They have shown that they do not trust their\r\ndestiny. Can you rely upon them for the winning back of your kingdom?'\r\n\r\n'They thought I was dead,' he grunted, recovering some of his poise. 'I\r\nhave no son. Men can't be governed by a memory. What if the Nemedians\r\nhave taken Tarantia? There still remain the provinces, the barons, and\r\nthe people of the countrysides. Valerius has won an empty glory.'\r\n\r\n'You are stubborn, as befits a fighter. I cannot show you the future, I\r\ncannot show you all the past. Nay, _I_ show you nothing. I merely make\r\nyou see windows opened in the veil by powers unguessed. Would you look\r\ninto the past for a clue of the present?'\r\n\r\n'Aye.' He seated himself abruptly.\r\n\r\nAgain the green smoke rose and billowed. Again images unfolded before\r\nhim, this time alien and seemingly irrelevant. He saw great towering\r\nblack walls, pedestals half hidden in the shadows upholding images of\r\nhideous, half-bestial gods. Men moved in the shadows, dark, wiry men,\r\nclad in red, silken loincloths. They were bearing a green jade\r\nsarcophagus along a gigantic black corridor. But before he could tell\r\nmuch about what he saw, the scene shifted. He saw a cavern, dim, shadowy\r\nand haunted with a strange intangible horror. On an altar of black stone\r\nstood a curious golden vessel, shaped like the shell of a scallop. Into\r\nthis cavern came some of the same dark, wiry men who had borne the\r\nmummy-case. They seized the golden vessel, and then the shadows swirled\r\naround them and what happened he could not say. But he saw a glimmer in\r\na whorl of darkness, like a ball of living fire. Then the smoke was only\r\nsmoke, drifting up from the fire of tamarisk chunks, thinning and\r\nfading.\r\n\r\n'But what does this portend?' he demanded, bewildered. 'What I saw in\r\nTarantia I can understand. But what means this glimpse of Zamorian\r\nthieves sneaking through a subterranean temple of Set, in Stygia? And\r\nthat cavern--I've never seen or heard of anything like it, in all my\r\nwanderings. If you can show me that much, these shreds of vision which\r\nmean nothing, disjointed, why can you not show me all that is to occur?'\r\n\r\nZelata stirred the fire without replying.\r\n\r\n'These things are governed by immutable laws,' she said at last. 'I can\r\nnot make you understand; I do not altogether understand myself, though I\r\nhave sought wisdom in the silences of the high places for more years\r\nthan I can remember. I cannot save you, though I would if I might. Man\r\nmust, at last, work out his own salvation. Yet perhaps wisdom may come\r\nto me in dreams, and in the morn I may be able to give you the clue to\r\nthe enigma.'\r\n\r\n'What enigma?' he demanded.\r\n\r\n'The mystery that confronts you, whereby you have lost a kingdom,' she\r\nanswered. And then she spread a sheepskin upon the floor before the\r\nhearth. 'Sleep,' she said briefly.\r\n\r\nWithout a word he stretched himself upon it, and sank into restless but\r\ndeep sleep through which phantoms moved silently and monstrous shapeless\r\nshadows crept. Once, limned against a purple sunless horizon, he saw the\r\nmighty walls and towers of a great city such as rose nowhere on the\r\nwaking earth he knew. Its colossal pylons and purple minarets lifted\r\ntoward the stars, and over it, floating like a giant mirage, hovered the\r\nbearded countenance of the man Xaltotun.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConan woke in the chill whiteness of early dawn, to see Zelata crouched\r\nbeside the tiny fire. He had not awakened once in the night, and the\r\nsound of the great wolf leaving or entering should have roused him. Yet\r\nthe wolf was there, beside the hearth, with its shaggy coat wet with\r\ndew, and with more than dew. Blood glistened wetly amid the thick fell,\r\nand there was a cut upon his shoulder.\r\n\r\nZelata nodded, without looking around, as if reading the thoughts of her\r\nroyal guest.\r\n\r\n'He has hunted before dawn, and red was the hunting. I think the man who\r\nhunted a king will hunt no more, neither man nor beast.'\r\n\r\nConan stared at the great beast with strange fascination as he moved to\r\ntake the food Zelata offered him.\r\n\r\n'When I come to my throne again I won't forget,' he said briefly.\r\n'You've befriended me--by Crom, I can't remember when I've lain down and\r\nslept at the mercy of man or woman as I did last night. But what of the\r\nriddle you would read me this morn?'\r\n\r\nA long silence ensued, in which the crackle of the tamarisks was loud on\r\nthe hearth.\r\n\r\n'Find the heart of your kingdom,' she said at last. 'There lies your\r\ndefeat and your power. You fight more than mortal man. You will not\r\npress the throne again unless you find the heart of your kingdom.'\r\n\r\n'Do you mean the city of Tarantia?'\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. 'I am but an oracle, through whose lips the gods\r\nspeak. My lips are sealed by them lest I speak too much. You must find\r\nthe heart of your kingdom. I can say no more. My lips are opened and\r\nsealed by the gods.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDawn was still white on the peaks when Conan rode westward. A glance\r\nback showed him Zelata standing in the door of her hut, inscrutable as\r\never, the great wolf beside her.\r\n\r\nA gray sky arched overhead, and a moaning wind was chill with a promise\r\nof winter. Brown leaves fluttered slowly down from the bare branches,\r\nsifting upon his mailed shoulders.\r\n\r\nAll day he pushed through the hills, avoiding roads and villages. Toward\r\nnightfall he began to drop down from the heights, tier by tier, and saw\r\nthe broad plains of Aquilonia spread out beneath him.\r\n\r\nVillages and farms lay close to the foot of the hills on the western\r\nside of the mountains, for, for half a century, most of the raiding\r\nacross the frontier had been done by the Aquilonians. But now only\r\nembers and ashes showed where farm huts and villas had stood.\r\n\r\nIn the gathering darkness Conan rode slowly on. There was little fear of\r\ndiscovery, which he dreaded from friend as well as from foe. The\r\nNemedians had remembered old scores on their westward drive, and\r\nValerius had made no attempt to restrain his allies. He did not count on\r\nwinning the love of the common people. A vast swath of desolation had\r\nbeen cut through the country from the foothills westward. Conan cursed\r\nas he rode over blackened expanses that had been rich fields, and saw\r\nthe gaunt gable-ends of burned houses jutting against the sky. He moved\r\nthrough an empty and deserted land, like a ghost out of a forgotten and\r\noutworn past.\r\n\r\nThe speed with which the army had traversed the land showed what little\r\nresistance it had encountered. Yet had Conan been leading his\r\nAquilonians the invading army would have been forced to buy every foot\r\nthey gained with their blood. The bitter realization permeated his soul;\r\nhe was not the representative of a dynasty. He was only a lone\r\nadventurer. Even the drop of dynastic blood Valerius boasted had more\r\nhold on the minds of men than the memory of Conan and the freedom and\r\npower he had given the kingdom.\r\n\r\nNo pursuers followed him down out of the hills. He watched for wandering\r\nor returning Nemedian troops, but met none. Skulkers gave him a wide\r\npath, supposing him to be one of the conquerors, what of his harness.\r\nGroves and rivers were far more plentiful on the western side of the\r\nmountains, and coverts for concealment were not lacking.\r\n\r\nSo he moved across the pillaged land, halting only to rest his horse,\r\neating frugally of the food Zelata had given him, until, on a dawn when\r\nhe lay hidden on a river bank where willows and oaks grew thickly, he\r\nglimpsed, afar, across the rolling plains dotted with rich groves, the\r\nblue and golden towers of Tarantia.\r\n\r\nHe was no longer in a deserted land, but one teeming with varied life.\r\nHis progress thenceforth was slow and cautious, through thick woods and\r\nunfrequented byways. It was dusk when he reached the plantation of\r\nServius Galannus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\nDying Embers\r\n\r\n\r\nThe countryside about Tarantia had escaped the fearful ravaging of the\r\nmore easterly provinces. There were evidences of the march of a\r\nconquering army in broken hedges, plundered fields and looted granaries,\r\nbut torch and steel had not been loosed wholesale.\r\n\r\nThere was but one grim splotch on the landscape--a charred expanse of\r\nashes and blackened stone, where, Conan knew, had once stood the stately\r\nvilla of one of his staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nThe king dared not openly approach the Galannus farm, which lay only a\r\nfew miles from the city. In the twilight he rode through an extensive\r\nwoodland, until he sighted a keeper's lodge through the trees.\r\nDismounting and tying his horse, he approached the thick, arched door\r\nwith the intention of sending the keeper after Servius. He did not know\r\nwhat enemies the manor house might be sheltering. He had seen no troops,\r\nbut they might be quartered all over the countryside. But as he drew\r\nnear, he saw the door open and a compact figure in silk hose and richly\r\nembroidered doublet stride forth and turn up a path that wound away\r\nthrough the woods.\r\n\r\n'Servius!'\r\n\r\nAt the low call the master of the plantation wheeled with a startled\r\nexclamation. His hand flew to the short hunting-sword at his hip, and he\r\nrecoiled from the tall gray steel figure standing in the dusk before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' he demanded. 'What is your--_Mitra!_'\r\n\r\nHis breath hissed inward and his ruddy face paled. 'Avaunt!' he\r\nejaculated. 'Why have you come back from the gray lands of death to\r\nterrify me? I was always your true liegeman in your lifetime----'\r\n\r\n'As I still expect you to be,' answered Conan. 'Stop trembling, man; I'm\r\nflesh and blood.'\r\n\r\nSweating with uncertainty Servius approached and stared into the face of\r\nthe mail-clad giant, and then, convinced of the reality of what he saw,\r\nhe dropped to one knee and doffed his plumed cap.\r\n\r\n'Your Majesty! Truly, this is a miracle passing belief! The great bell\r\nin the citadel has tolled your dirge, days agone. Men said you died at\r\nValkia, crushed under a million tons of earth and broken granite.'\r\n\r\n'It was another in my harness,' grunted Conan. 'But let us talk later.\r\nIf there is such a thing as a joint of beef on your board----'\r\n\r\n'Forgive me, my lord!' cried Servius, springing to his feet. 'The dust\r\nof travel is gray on your mail, and I keep you standing here without\r\nrest or sup! Mitra! I see well enough now that you are alive, but I\r\nswear, when I turned and saw you standing all gray and dim in the\r\ntwilight, the marrow of my knees turned to water. It is an ill thing to\r\nmeet a man you thought dead in the woodland at dusk.'\r\n\r\n'Bid the keeper see to my steed which is tied behind yonder oak,'\r\nrequested Conan, and Servius nodded, drawing the king up the path. The\r\npatrician, recovering from his supernatural fright, had become extremely\r\nnervous.\r\n\r\n'I will send a servant from the manor,' he said. 'The keeper is in his\r\nlodge--but I dare not trust even my servants in these days. It is better\r\nthat only I know of your presence.'\r\n\r\nApproaching the great house that glimmered dimly through the trees, he\r\nturned aside into a little-used path that ran between close-set oaks\r\nwhose intertwining branches formed a vault overhead, shutting out the\r\ndim light of the gathering dusk. Servius hurried on through the darkness\r\nwithout speaking, and with something resembling panic in his manner, and\r\npresently led Conan through a small side-door into a narrow, dimly\r\nilluminated corridor. They traversed this in haste and silence, and\r\nServius brought the king into a spacious chamber with a high, oak-beamed\r\nceiling and richly paneled walls. Logs flamed in the wide fireplace, for\r\nthere was a frosty edge to the air, and a great meat pasty in a stone\r\nplatter stood smoking on a broad mahogany board. Servius locked the\r\nmassive door and extinguished the candles that stood in a silver\r\ncandlestick on the table, leaving the chamber illuminated only by the\r\nfire on the hearth.\r\n\r\n'Your pardon, your Majesty,' he apologized. 'These are perilous times;\r\nspies lurk everywhere. It were better that none be able to peer through\r\nthe windows and recognize you. This pasty, however, is just from the\r\noven, as I intended supping on my return from talk with my keeper. If\r\nyour Majesty would deign----'\r\n\r\n'The light is sufficient,' grunted Conan, seating himself with scant\r\nceremony, and drawing his poniard.\r\n\r\nHe dug ravenously into the luscious dish, and washed it down with great\r\ngulps of wine from grapes grown in Servius' vineyards. He seemed\r\noblivious to any sense of peril, but Servius shifted uneasily on his\r\nsettle by the fire, nervously fingering the heavy gold chain about his\r\nneck. He glanced continually at the diamond-panes of the casement,\r\ngleaming dimly in the firelight, and cocked his ear toward the door, as\r\nif half expecting to hear the pad of furtive feet in the corridor\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\nFinishing his meal, Conan rose and seated himself on another settle\r\nbefore the fire.\r\n\r\n'I won't jeopardize you long by my presence, Servius,' he said abruptly.\r\n'Dawn will find me far from your plantation.'\r\n\r\n'My lord----' Servius lifted his hands in expostulation, but Conan waved\r\nhis protests aside.\r\n\r\n'I know your loyalty and your courage. Both are above reproach. But if\r\nValerius has usurped my throne, it would be death for you to shelter me,\r\nif you were discovered.'\r\n\r\n'I am not strong enough to defy him openly,' admitted Servius. 'The\r\nfifty men-at-arms I could lead to battle would be but a handful of\r\nstraws. You saw the ruins of Emilius Scavonus' plantation?'\r\n\r\nConan nodded, frowning darkly.\r\n\r\n'He was the strongest patrician in this province, as you know. He\r\nrefused to give his allegiance to Valerius. The Nemedians burned him in\r\nthe ruins of his own villa. After that the rest of us saw the futility\r\nof resistance, especially as the people of Tarantia refused to fight. We\r\nsubmitted and Valerius spared our lives, though he levied a tax upon us\r\nthat will ruin many. But what could we do? We thought you were dead.\r\nMany of the barons had been slain, others taken prisoner. The army was\r\nshattered and scattered. You have no heir to take the crown. There was\r\nno one to lead us----'\r\n\r\n'Was there not Count Trocero of Poitain?' demanded Conan harshly.\r\n\r\nServius spread his hands helplessly.\r\n\r\n'It is true that his general Prospero was in the field with a small\r\narmy. Retreating before Amalric, he urged men to rally to his banner.\r\nBut with your Majesty dead, men remembered old wars and civil brawls,\r\nand how Trocero and his Poitanians once rode through these provinces\r\neven as Amalric was riding now, with torch and sword. The barons were\r\njealous of Trocero. Some men--spies of Valerius perhaps--shouted that\r\nthe Count of Poitain intended seizing the crown for himself. Old\r\nsectional hates flared up again. If we had had one man with dynastic\r\nblood in his veins we would have crowned and followed him against\r\nNemedia. But we had none.\r\n\r\n'The barons who followed you loyally would not follow one of their own\r\nnumber, each holding himself as good as his neighbor, each fearing the\r\nambitions of the others. You were the cord that held the fagots\r\ntogether. When the cord was cut, the fagots fell apart. If you had had\r\na son, the barons would have rallied loyally to him. But there was no\r\npoint for their patriotism to focus upon.\r\n\r\n'The merchants and commoners, dreading anarchy and a return of feudal\r\ndays when each baron was his own law, cried out that any king was better\r\nthan none, even Valerius, who was at least of the blood of the old\r\ndynasty. There was no one to oppose him when he rode up at the head of\r\nhis steel-clad hosts, with the scarlet dragon of Nemedia floating over\r\nhim, and rang his lance against the gates of Tarantia.\r\n\r\n'Nay, the people threw open the gates and knelt in the dust before him.\r\nThey had refused to aid Prospero in holding the city. They said they had\r\nrather be ruled by Valerius than by Trocero. They said--truthfully--that\r\nthe barons would not rally to Trocero, but that many would accept\r\nValerius. They said that by yielding to Valerius they would escape the\r\ndevastation of civil war, and the fury of the Nemedians. Prospero rode\r\nsouthward with his ten thousand knights, and the horsemen of the\r\nNemedians entered the city a few hours later. They did not follow him.\r\nThey remained to see that Valerius was crowned in Tarantia.'\r\n\r\n'Then the old witch's smoke showed the truth,' muttered Conan, feeling a\r\nqueer chill along his spine. 'Amalric crowned Valerius?'\r\n\r\n'Aye, in the coronation hall, with the blood of slaughter scarcely dried\r\non his hands.'\r\n\r\n'And do the people thrive under his benevolent rule?' asked Conan with\r\nangry irony.\r\n\r\n'He lives like a foreign prince in the midst of a conquered land,'\r\nanswered Servius bitterly. 'His court is filled with Nemedians, the\r\npalace troops are of the same breed, and a large garrison of them occupy\r\nthe citadel. Aye, the hour of the Dragon has come at last.\r\n\r\n'Nemedians swagger like lords through the streets. Women are outraged\r\nand merchants plundered daily, and Valerius either can, or will, make no\r\nattempt to curb them. Nay, he is but their puppet, their figurehead. Men\r\nof sense knew he would be, and the people are beginning to find it out.\r\n\r\n'Amalric has ridden forth with a strong army to reduce the outlying\r\nprovinces where some of the barons have defied him. But there is no\r\nunity among them. Their jealousy of each other is stronger than their\r\nfear of Amalric. He will crush them one by one. Many castles and cities,\r\nrealizing that, have sent in their submission. Those who resist fare\r\nmiserably. The Nemedians are glutting their long hatred. And their ranks\r\nare swelled by Aquilonians whom fear, gold, or necessity of occupation\r\nare forcing into their armies. It is a natural consequence.'\r\n\r\nConan nodded somberly, staring at the red reflections of the firelight\r\non the richly carved oaken panels.\r\n\r\n'Aquilonia has a king instead of the anarchy they feared,' said Servius\r\nat last. 'Valerius does not protect his subjects against his allies.\r\nHundreds who could not pay the ransom imposed upon them have been sold\r\nto the Kothic slave-traders.'\r\n\r\nConan's head jerked up and a lethal flame lit his blue eyes. He swore\r\ngustily, his mighty hands knotting into iron hammers.\r\n\r\n'Aye, white men sell white men and white women, as it was in the feudal\r\ndays. In the palaces of Shem and of Turan they will live out the lives\r\nof slaves. Valerius is king, but the unity for which the people looked,\r\neven though of the sword, is not complete.\r\n\r\n'Gunderland in the north and Poitain in the south are yet unconquered,\r\nand there are unsubdued provinces in the west, where the border barons\r\nhave the backing of the Bossonian bowmen. Yet these outlying provinces\r\nare no real menace to Valerius. They must remain on the defensive, and\r\nwill be lucky if they are able to keep their independence. Here Valerius\r\nand his foreign knights are supreme.'\r\n\r\n'Let him make the best of it then,' said Conan grimly. 'His time is\r\nshort. The people will rise when they learn that I'm alive. We'll take\r\nTarantia back before Amalric can return with his army. Then we'll sweep\r\nthese dogs from the kingdom.'\r\n\r\nServius was silent. The crackle of the fire was loud in the stillness.\r\n\r\n'Well,' exclaimed Conan impatiently, 'why do you sit with your head\r\nbent, staring at the hearth? Do you doubt what I have said?'\r\n\r\nServius avoided the king's eye.\r\n\r\n'What mortal man can do, you will do, your Majesty,' he answered. 'I\r\nhave ridden behind you in battle, and I know that no mortal being can\r\nstand before your sword.'\r\n\r\n'What, then?'\r\n\r\nServius drew his fur-trimmed jupon closer about him, and shivered in\r\nspite of the flame.\r\n\r\n'Men say your fall was occasioned by sorcery,' he said presently.\r\n\r\n'What then?'\r\n\r\n'What mortal can fight against sorcery? Who is this veiled man who\r\ncommunes at midnight with Valerius and his allies, as men say, who\r\nappears and disappears so mysteriously? Men say in whispers that he is a\r\ngreat magician who died thousands of years ago, but has returned from\r\ndeath's gray lands to overthrow the king of Aquilonia and restore the\r\ndynasty of which Valerius is heir.'\r\n\r\n'What matter?' exclaimed Conan angrily. 'I escaped from the\r\ndevil-haunted pits of Belverus, and from diabolism in the mountains. If\r\nthe people rise----'\r\n\r\nServius shook his head.\r\n\r\n'Your staunchest supporters in the eastern and central provinces are\r\ndead, fled or imprisoned. Gunderland is far to the north, Poitain far\r\nto the south. The Bossonians have retired to their marches far to the\r\nwest. It would take weeks to gather and concentrate these forces, and\r\nbefore that could be done, each levy would be attacked separately by\r\nAmalric and destroyed.'\r\n\r\n'But an uprising in the central provinces would tip the scales for us!'\r\nexclaimed Conan. 'We could seize Tarantia and hold it against Amalric\r\nuntil the Gundermen and Poitanians could get here.'\r\n\r\nServius hesitated, and his voice sank to a whisper.\r\n\r\n'Men say you died accursed. Men say this veiled stranger cast a spell\r\nupon you to slay you and break your army. The great bell has tolled your\r\ndirge. Men believe you to be dead. And the central provinces would not\r\nrise, even if they knew you lived. They would not dare. Sorcery defeated\r\nyou at Valkia. Sorcery brought the news to Tarantia, for that very night\r\nmen were shouting of it in the streets.\r\n\r\n'A Nemedian priest loosed black magic again in the streets of Tarantia\r\nto slay men who still were loyal to your memory. I myself saw it. Armed\r\nmen dropped like flies and died in the streets in a manner no man could\r\nunderstand. And the lean priest laughed and said: 'I am only Altaro,\r\nonly an acolyte of Orastes, who is but an acolyte of him who wears the\r\nveil; not mine is the power; the power but works through me.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Conan harshly, 'is it not better to die honorably than to\r\nlive in infamy? Is death worse than oppression, slavery and ultimate\r\ndestruction?'\r\n\r\n'When the fear of sorcery is in, reason is out,' replied Servius. 'The\r\nfear of the central provinces is too great to allow them to rise for\r\nyou. The outlying provinces would fight for you--but the same sorcery\r\nthat smote your army at Valkia would smite you again. The Nemedians hold\r\nthe broadest, richest and most thickly populated sections of Aquilonia,\r\nand they cannot be defeated by the forces which might still be at your\r\ncommand. You would be sacrificing your loyal subjects uselessly. In\r\nsorrow I say it, but it is true: King Conan, you are a king without a\r\nkingdom.'\r\n\r\nConan stared into the fire without replying. A smoldering log crashed\r\ndown among the flames without a bursting shower of sparks. It might have\r\nbeen the crashing ruin of his kingdom.\r\n\r\nAgain Conan felt the presence of a grim reality behind the veil of\r\nmaterial illusion. He sensed again the inexorable drive of a ruthless\r\nfate. A feeling of furious panic tugged at his soul, a sense of being\r\ntrapped, and a red rage that burned to destroy and kill.\r\n\r\n'Where are the officials of my court?' he demanded at last.\r\n\r\n'Pallantides was sorely wounded at Valkia, was ransomed by his family,\r\nand now lies in his castle in Attalus. He will be fortunate if he ever\r\nrides again. Publius, the chancellor, has fled the kingdom in disguise,\r\nno man knows whither. The council has been disbanded. Some were\r\nimprisoned, some banished. Many of your loyal subjects have been put to\r\ndeath. Tonight, for instance, the Countess Albiona dies under the\r\nheadsman's ax.'\r\n\r\nConan started and stared at Servius with such anger smoldering in his\r\nblue eyes that the patrician shrank back.\r\n\r\n'Why?'\r\n\r\n'Because she would not become the mistress of Valerius. Her lands are\r\nforfeit, her henchmen sold into slavery, and at midnight, in the Iron\r\nTower, her head must fall. Be advised, my king--to me you will ever be\r\nmy king--and flee before you are discovered. In these days none is safe.\r\nSpies and informers creep among us, betraying the slightest deed or word\r\nof discontent as treason and rebellion. If you make yourself known to\r\nyour subjects it will only end in your capture and death.\r\n\r\n'My horses and all the men that I can trust are at your disposal. Before\r\ndawn we can be far from Tarantia, and well on our way toward the border.\r\nIf I cannot aid you to recover your kingdom, I can at least follow you\r\ninto exile.'\r\n\r\nConan shook his head. Servius glanced uneasily at him as he sat staring\r\ninto the fire, his chin propped on his mighty fist. The firelight\r\ngleamed redly on his steel mail, on his baleful eyes. They burned in the\r\nfirelight like the eyes of a wolf. Servius was again aware, as in the\r\npast, and now more strongly than ever, of something alien about the\r\nking. That great frame under the mail mesh was too hard and supple for a\r\ncivilized man; the elemental fire of the primitive burned in those\r\nsmoldering eyes. Now the barbaric suggestion about the king was more\r\npronounced, as if in his extremity the outward aspects of civilization\r\nwere stripped away, to reveal the primordial core. Conan was reverting\r\nto his pristine type. He did not act as a civilized man would act under\r\nthe same conditions, nor did his thoughts run in the same channels. He\r\nwas unpredictable. It was only a stride from the king of Aquilonia to\r\nthe skin-clad slayer of the Cimmerian hills.\r\n\r\n'I'll ride to Poitain, if it may be,' Conan said at last. 'But I'll ride\r\nalone. And I have one last duty to perform as king of Aquilonia.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean, your Majesty?' asked Servius, shaken by a\r\npremonition.\r\n\r\n'I'm going into Tarantia after Albiona tonight,' answered the king.\r\n'I've failed all my other loyal subjects, it seems--if they take her\r\nhead, they can have mine too.'\r\n\r\n'This is madness!' cried Servius, staggering up and clutching his\r\nthroat, as if he already felt the noose closing about it.\r\n\r\n'There are secrets to the Tower which few know,' said Conan. 'Anyway,\r\nI'd be a dog to leave Albiona to die because of her loyalty to me. I may\r\nbe a king without a kingdom, but I'm not a man without honor.'\r\n\r\n'It will ruin us all!' whispered Servius.\r\n\r\n'It will ruin no one but me if I fail. You've risked enough. I ride\r\nalone tonight. This is all I want you to do: procure me a patch for my\r\neye, a staff for my hand, and garments such as travelers wear.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n'It is the King or His Ghost!'\r\n\r\n\r\nMany men passed through the great arched gates of Tarantia between\r\nsunset and midnight--belated travelers, merchants from afar with heavily\r\nladen mules, free workmen from the surrounding farms and vineyards. Now\r\nthat Valerius was supreme in the central provinces, there was no rigid\r\nscrutiny of the folk who flowed in a steady stream through the wide\r\ngates. Discipline had been relaxed. The Nemedian soldiers who stood on\r\nguard were half drunk, and much too busy watching for handsome peasant\r\ngirls and rich merchants who could be bullied to notice workmen or dusty\r\ntravelers, even one tall wayfarer whose worn cloak could not conceal the\r\nhard lines of his powerful frame.\r\n\r\nThis man carried himself with an erect, aggressive bearing that was too\r\nnatural for him to realize it himself, much less dissemble it. A great\r\npatch covered one eye, and his leather coif, drawn low over his brows,\r\nshadowed his features. With a long thick staff in his muscular brown\r\nhand, he strode leisurely through the arch where the torches flared and\r\nguttered, and, ignored by the tipsy guardsmen, emerged upon the wide\r\nstreets of Tarantia.\r\n\r\nUpon these well-lighted thoroughfares the usual throngs went about their\r\nbusiness, and shops and stalls stood open, with their wares displayed.\r\nOne thread ran a constant theme through the pattern. Nemedian soldiers,\r\nsingly or in clumps, swaggered through the throngs, shouldering their\r\nway with studied arrogance. Women scurried from their path, and men\r\nstepped aside with darkened brows and clenched fists. The Aquilonians\r\nwere a proud race, and these were their hereditary enemies.\r\n\r\nThe knuckles of the tall traveler knotted on his staff, but, like the\r\nothers, he stepped aside to let the men in armor have the way. Among the\r\nmotley and varied crowd he did not attract much attention in his drab,\r\ndusty garments. But once, as he passed a sword-seller's stall and the\r\nlight that streamed from its wide door fell full upon him, he thought\r\nhe felt an intense stare upon him, and turning quickly, saw a man in the\r\nbrown jerkin of a free workman regarding him fixedly. This man turned\r\naway with undue haste, and vanished in the shifting throng. But Conan\r\nturned into a narrow by-street and quickened his pace. It might have\r\nbeen mere idle curiosity; but he could take no chances.\r\n\r\nThe grim Iron Tower stood apart from the citadel, amid a maze of narrow\r\nstreets and crowding houses where the meaner structures, appropriating a\r\nspace from which the more fastidious shrank, had invaded a portion of\r\nthe city ordinarily alien to them. The Tower was in reality a castle, an\r\nancient, formidable pile of heavy stone and black iron, which had itself\r\nserved as the citadel in an earlier, ruder century.\r\n\r\nNot a long distance from it, lost in a tangle of partly deserted\r\ntenements and warehouses, stood an ancient watchtower, so old and\r\nforgotten that it did not appear on the maps of the city for a hundred\r\nyears back. Its original purpose had been forgotten, and nobody, of such\r\nas saw it at all, noticed that the apparently ancient lock which kept it\r\nfrom being appropriated as sleeping-quarters by beggars and thieves, was\r\nin reality comparatively new and extremely powerful, cunningly disguised\r\ninto an appearance of rusty antiquity. Not half a dozen men in the\r\nkingdom had ever known the secret of that tower.\r\n\r\nNo keyhole showed in the massive, green-crusted lock. But Conan's\r\npractised fingers, stealing over it, pressed here and there knobs\r\ninvisible to the casual eye. The door silently opened inward and he\r\nentered solid blackness, pushing the door shut behind him. A light would\r\nhave showed the tower empty, a bare, cylindrical shaft of massive stone.\r\n\r\nGroping in a corner with the sureness of familiarity, he found the\r\nprojections for which he was feeling on a slab of the stone that\r\ncomposed the floor. Quickly he lifted it, and without hesitation lowered\r\nhimself into the aperture beneath. His feet felt stone steps leading\r\ndownward into what he knew was a narrow tunnel that ran straight toward\r\nthe foundations of the Iron Tower, three streets away.\r\n\r\nThe bell on the citadel, which tolled only at the midnight hour or for\r\nthe death of a king, boomed suddenly. In a dimly lighted chamber in the\r\nIron Tower a door opened and a form emerged into a corridor. The\r\ninterior of the Tower was as forbidding as its external appearance. Its\r\nmassive stone walls were rough, unadorned. The flags of the floor were\r\nworn deep by generations of faltering feet, and the vault of the ceiling\r\nwas gloomy in the dim light of torches set in niches.\r\n\r\nThe man who trudged down that grim corridor was in appearance in keeping\r\nwith his surroundings. He was a tall, powerfully built man, clad in\r\nclose-fitting black silk. Over his head was drawn a black hood which\r\nfell about his shoulders, having two holes for his eyes. From his\r\nshoulders hung a loose black cloak, and over one shoulder he bore a\r\nheavy ax, the shape of which was that of neither tool nor weapon.\r\n\r\nAs he went down the corridor, a figure came hobbling up it, a bent,\r\nsurly old man, stooping under the weight of his pike and a lantern he\r\nbore in one hand.\r\n\r\n'You are not as prompt as your predecessor, master headsman,' he\r\ngrumbled. 'Midnight has just struck, and masked men have gone to\r\nmilady's cell. They await you.'\r\n\r\n'The tones of the bell still echo among the towers,' answered the\r\nexecutioner. 'If I am not so quick to leap and run at the beck of\r\nAquilonians as was the dog who held this office before me, they shall\r\nfind my arm no less ready. Get you to your duties, old watchman, and\r\nleave me to mine. I think mine is the sweeter trade, by Mitra, for you\r\ntramp cold corridors and peer at rusty dungeon doors, while I lop off\r\nthe fairest head in Tarantia this night.'\r\n\r\nThe watchman limped on down the corridor, still grumbling, and the\r\nheadsman resumed his leisurely way. A few strides carried him around a\r\nturn in the corridor, and he absently noted that at his left a door\r\nstood partly open. If he had thought, he would have known that that door\r\nhad been opened since the watchman passed; but thinking was not his\r\ntrade. He was passing the unlocked door before he realized that aught\r\nwas amiss, and then it was too late.\r\n\r\nA soft tigerish step and the rustle of a cloak warned him, but before he\r\ncould turn, a heavy arm hooked about his throat from behind, crushing\r\nthe cry before it could reach his lips. In the brief instant that was\r\nallowed him he realized with a surge of panic the strength of his\r\nattacker, against which his own brawny thews were helpless. He sensed\r\nwithout seeing the poised dagger.\r\n\r\n'Nemedian dog!' muttered a voice thick with passion in his ear. 'You've\r\ncut off your last Aquilonian head!'\r\n\r\nAnd that was the last thing he ever heard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a dank dungeon, lighted only by a guttering torch, three men stood\r\nabout a young woman who knelt on the rush-strewn flags staring wildly up\r\nat them. She was clad only in a scanty shift; her golden hair fell in\r\nlustrous ripples about her white shoulders, and her wrists were bound\r\nbehind her. Even in the uncertain torchlight, and in spite of her\r\ndisheveled condition and pallor of fear, her beauty was striking. She\r\nknelt mutely, staring with wide eyes up at her tormenters. The men were\r\nclosely masked and cloaked. Such a deed as this needed masks, even in a\r\nconquered land. She knew them all nevertheless; but what she knew would\r\nharm no one--after that night.\r\n\r\n'Our merciful sovereign offers you one more chance, Countess,' said the\r\ntallest of the three, and he spoke Aquilonian without an accent. 'He\r\nbids me say that if you soften your proud, rebellious spirit, he will\r\nstill open his arms to you. If not--' he gestured toward a grim wooden\r\nblock in the center of the cell. It was blackly stained, and showed many\r\ndeep nicks as if a keen edge, cutting through some yielding substance,\r\nhad sunk into the wood.\r\n\r\nAlbiona shuddered and turned pale, shrinking back. Every fiber in her\r\nvigorous young body quivered with the urge of life. Valerius was young,\r\ntoo, and handsome. Many women loved him, she told herself, fighting with\r\nherself for life. But she could not speak the word that would ransom her\r\nsoft young body from the block and the dripping ax. She could not reason\r\nthe matter. She only knew that when she thought of the clasp of\r\nValerius' arms, her flesh crawled with an abhorrence greater than the\r\nfear of death. She shook her head helplessly, compelled by an impulsion\r\nmore irresistible than the instinct to live.\r\n\r\n'Then there is no more to be said!' exclaimed one of the others\r\nimpatiently, and he spoke with a Nemedian accent. 'Where is the\r\nheadsman?'\r\n\r\nAs if summoned by the word, the dungeon door opened silently, and a\r\ngreat figure stood framed in it, like a black shadow from the\r\nunderworld.\r\n\r\nAlbiona voiced a low, involuntary cry at the sight of that grim shape,\r\nand the others stared silently for a moment, perhaps themselves daunted\r\nwith superstitious awe at the silent, hooded figure. Through the coif\r\nthe eyes blazed like coals of blue fire, and as these eyes rested on\r\neach man in turn, he felt a curious chill travel down his spine.\r\n\r\nThen the tall Aquilonian roughly seized the girl and dragged her to the\r\nblock. She screamed uncontrollably and fought hopelessly against him,\r\nfrantic with terror, but he ruthlessly forced her to her knees, and bent\r\nher yellow head down to the bloody block.\r\n\r\n'Why do you delay, headsman?' he exclaimed angrily. 'Perform your task!'\r\n\r\nHe was answered by a short, gusty boom of laughter that was\r\nindescribably menacing. All in the dungeon froze in their places,\r\nstaring at the hooded shape--the two cloaked figures, the masked man\r\nbending over the girl, the girl herself on her knees, twisting her\r\nimprisoned head to look upward.\r\n\r\n'What means this unseemly mirth, dog?' demanded the Aquilonian uneasily.\r\n\r\nThe man in the black garb tore his hood from his head and flung it to\r\nthe ground; he set his back to the closed door and lifted the headsman's\r\nax.\r\n\r\n'Do you know me, dogs?' he rumbled. 'Do you know me?'\r\n\r\nThe breathless silence was broken by a scream.\r\n\r\n'The king!' shrieked Albiona, wrenching herself free from the slackened\r\ngrasp of her captor. 'Oh, Mitra, the king!'\r\n\r\nThe three men stood like statues, and then the Aquilonian started and\r\nspoke, like a man who doubts his own senses.\r\n\r\n'Conan!' he ejaculated. 'It is the king, or his ghost! What devil's work\r\nis this?'\r\n\r\n'Devil's work to match devils!' mocked Conan, his lips laughing but hell\r\nflaming in his eyes. 'Come, fall to, my gentlemen. You have your swords,\r\nand I this cleaver. Nay, I think this butcher's tool fits the work at\r\nhand, my fair lords!'\r\n\r\n'At him!' muttered the Aquilonian, drawing his sword. 'It is Conan and\r\nwe must kill or be killed!'\r\n\r\nAnd like men waking from a trance, the Nemedians drew their blades and\r\nrushed on the king.\r\n\r\nThe headsman's ax was not made for such work, but the king wielded the\r\nheavy, clumsy weapon as lightly as a hatchet, and his quickness of foot,\r\nas he constantly shifted his position, defeated their purpose of\r\nengaging him all three at once.\r\n\r\nHe caught the sword of the first man on his ax-head and crushed in the\r\nwielder's breast with a murderous counterstroke before he could step\r\nback or parry. The remaining Nemedian, missing a savage swipe, had his\r\nbrains dashed out before he could recover his balance, and an instant\r\nlater the Aquilonian was backed into a corner, desperately parrying the\r\ncrashing strokes that rained about him, lacking opportunity even to\r\nscream for help.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Conan's long left arm shot out and ripped the mask from the\r\nman's head, disclosing the pallid features.\r\n\r\n'Dog!' grated the king. 'I thought I knew you. Traitor! Damned renegade!\r\nEven this base steel is too honorable for your foul head. Nay, die as\r\nthieves die!'\r\n\r\nThe ax fell in a devastating arch, and the Aquilonian cried out and went\r\nto his knees, grasping the severed stump of his right arm from which\r\nblood spouted. It had been shorn away at the elbow, and the ax,\r\nunchecked in its descent, had gashed deeply into his side, so that his\r\nentrails bulged out.\r\n\r\n'Lie there and bleed to death,' grunted Conan, casting the ax away\r\ndisgustedly. 'Come, Countess!'\r\n\r\nStooping, he slashed the cords that bound her wrists and lifting her as\r\nif she had been a child, strode from the dungeon. She was sobbing\r\nhysterically, with her arms thrown about his corded neck in a frenzied\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\n'Easy all,' he muttered. 'We're not out of this yet. If we can reach\r\nthe dungeon where the secret door opens on stairs that lead to the\r\ntunnel--devil take it, they've heard that noise, even through these\r\nwalls.'\r\n\r\nDown the corridor arms clanged and the tramp and shouting of men echoed\r\nunder the vaulted roof. A bent figure came hobbling swiftly along,\r\nlantern held high, and its light shone full on Conan and the girl. With\r\na curse the Cimmerian sprang toward him, but the old watchman,\r\nabandoning both lantern and pike, scuttled away down the corridor,\r\nscreeching for help at the top of his cracked voice. Deeper shouts\r\nanswered him.\r\n\r\nConan turned swiftly and ran the other way. He was cut off from the\r\ndungeon with the secret lock and the hidden door through which he had\r\nentered the Tower, and by which he had hoped to leave, but he knew this\r\ngrim building well. Before he was king he had been imprisoned in it.\r\n\r\nHe turned off into a side passage and quickly emerged into another,\r\nbroader corridor, which ran parallel to the one down which he had come,\r\nand which was at the moment deserted. He followed this only a few yards,\r\nwhen he again turned back, down another side passage. This brought him\r\nback into the corridor he had left, but at a strategic point. A few feet\r\nfarther up the corridor there was a heavy bolted door, and before it\r\nstood a bearded Nemedian in corselet and helmet, his back to Conan as he\r\npeered up the corridor in the direction of the growing tumult and wildly\r\nwaving lanterns.\r\n\r\nConan did not hesitate. Slipping the girl to the ground, he ran at the\r\nguard swiftly and silently, sword in hand. The man turned just as the\r\nking reached him, bawled in surprise and fright and lifted his pike; but\r\nbefore he could bring the clumsy weapon into play, Conan brought down\r\nhis sword on the fellow's helmet with a force that would have felled an\r\nox. Helmet and skull gave way together and the guard crumpled to the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nIn an instant Conan had drawn the massive bolt that barred the door--too\r\nheavy for one ordinary man to have manipulated--and called hastily to\r\nAlbiona, who ran staggering to him. Catching her up unceremoniously with\r\none arm, he bore her through the door and into the outer darkness.\r\n\r\nThey had come into a narrow alley, black as pitch, walled by the side of\r\nthe Tower on one hand, and the sheer stone back of a row of buildings on\r\nthe other. Conan, hurrying through the darkness as swiftly as he dared,\r\nfelt the latter wall for doors or windows, but found none.\r\n\r\nThe great door clanged open behind them, and men poured out, with\r\ntorches gleaming on breast-plates and naked swords. They glared about,\r\nbellowing, unable to penetrate the darkness which their torches served\r\nto illuminate for only a few feet in any direction, and then rushed\r\ndown the alley at random--heading in the direction opposite to that\r\ntaken by Conan and Albiona.\r\n\r\n'They'll learn their mistake quick enough,' he muttered, increasing his\r\npace. 'If we ever find a crack in this infernal wall--damn! The street\r\nwatch!'\r\n\r\nAhead of them a faint glow became apparent, where the alley opened into\r\na narrow street, and he saw dim figures looming against it with a\r\nglimmer of steel. It was indeed the street watch, investigating the\r\nnoise they had heard echoing down the alley.\r\n\r\n'Who goes there?' they shouted, and Conan grit his teeth at the hated\r\nNemedian accent.\r\n\r\n'Keep behind me,' he ordered the girl. 'We've got to cut our way through\r\nbefore the prison guards come back and pin us between them.'\r\n\r\nAnd grasping his sword, he ran straight at the oncoming figures. The\r\nadvantage of surprise was his. He could see them, limned against the\r\ndistant glow, and they could not see him coming at them out of the black\r\ndepths of the alley. He was among them before they knew it, smiting with\r\nthe silent fury of a wounded lion.\r\n\r\nHis one chance lay in hacking through before they could gather their\r\nwits. But there were half a score of them, in full mail, hard-bitten\r\nveterans of the border wars, in whom the instinct for battle could take\r\nthe place of bemused wits. Three of them were down before they realized\r\nthat it was only one man who was attacking them, but even so their\r\nreaction was instantaneous. The clangor of steel rose deafeningly, and\r\nsparks flew as Conan's sword crashed on basinet and hauberk. He could\r\nsee better than they, and in the dim light his swiftly moving figure was\r\nan uncertain mark. Flailing swords cut empty air or glanced from his\r\nblade, and when he struck it was with the fury and certainty of a\r\nhurricane.\r\n\r\nBut behind him sounded the shouts of the prison guards, returning up the\r\nalley at a run, and still the mailed figures before him barred his way\r\nwith a bristling wall of steel. In an instant the guards would be on his\r\nback--in desperation he redoubled his strokes, flailing like a smith on\r\nan anvil, and then was suddenly aware of a diversion. Out of nowhere\r\nbehind the watchmen rose a score of black figures and there was a sound\r\nof blows, murderously driven. Steel glinted in the gloom, and men cried\r\nout, struck mortally from behind. In an instant the alley was littered\r\nwith writhing forms. A dark, cloaked shape sprang toward Conan, who\r\nheaved up his sword, catching a gleam of steel in the right hand. But\r\nthe other was extended to him empty and a voice hissed urgently: 'This\r\nway, your Majesty! Quickly!'\r\n\r\nWith a muttered oath of surprise, Conan caught up Albiona in one\r\nmassive arm, and followed his unknown befriender. He was not inclined to\r\nhesitate, with thirty prison guardsmen closing in behind him.\r\n\r\nSurrounded by mysterious figures he hurried down the alley, carrying the\r\ncountess as if she had been a child. He could tell nothing of his\r\nrescuers except that they wore dark cloaks and hoods. Doubt and\r\nsuspicion crossed his mind, but at least they had struck down his\r\nenemies, and he saw no better course than to follow them.\r\n\r\nAs if sensing his doubt, the leader touched his arm lightly and said:\r\n'Fear not, King Conan; we are your loyal subjects.' The voice was not\r\nfamiliar, but the accent was Aquilonian of the central provinces.\r\n\r\nBehind them the guards were yelling as they stumbled over the shambles\r\nin the mud, and they came pelting vengefully down the alley, seeing the\r\nvague dark mass moving between them and the light of the distant street.\r\nBut the hooded men turned suddenly toward the seemingly blank wall, and\r\nConan saw a door gape there. He muttered a curse. He had traversed that\r\nalley by day, in times past, and had never noticed a door there. But\r\nthrough it they went, and the door closed behind them with the click of\r\na lock. The sound was not reassuring, but his guides were hurrying him\r\non, moving with the precision of familiarity, guiding Conan with a hand\r\nat either elbow. It was like traversing a tunnel, and Conan felt\r\nAlbiona's lithe limbs trembling in his arms. Then somewhere ahead of\r\nthem an opening was faintly visible, merely a somewhat less black arch\r\nin the blackness, and through this they filed.\r\n\r\nAfter that there was a bewildering succession of dim courts and shadowy\r\nalleys and winding corridors, all traversed in utter silence, until at\r\nlast they emerged into a broad lighted chamber, the location of which\r\nConan could not even guess, for their devious route had confused even\r\nhis primitive sense of direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\nA Coin from Acheron\r\n\r\n\r\nNot all his guides entered the chamber. When the door closed, Conan saw\r\nonly one man standing before him--a slim figure, masked in a black cloak\r\nwith a hood. This the man threw back, disclosing a pale oval of a face,\r\nwith calm, delicately chiseled features.\r\n\r\nThe king set Albiona on her feet, but she still clung to him and stared\r\napprehensively about her. The chamber was a large one, with marble walls\r\npartly covered with black velvet hangings and thick rich carpets on the\r\nmosaic floor, laved in the soft golden glow of bronze lamps.\r\n\r\nConan instinctively laid a hand on his hilt. There was blood on his\r\nhand, blood clotted about the mouth of his scabbard, for he had sheathed\r\nhis blade without cleansing it.\r\n\r\n'Where are we?' he demanded.\r\n\r\nThe stranger answered with a low, profound bow in which the suspicious\r\nking could detect no trace of irony.\r\n\r\n'In the temple of Asura, your Majesty.'\r\n\r\nAlbiona cried out faintly and clung closer to Conan, staring fearfully\r\nat the black, arched doors, as if expecting the entry of some grisly\r\nshape of darkness.\r\n\r\n'Fear not, my lady,' said their guide. 'There is nothing here to harm\r\nyou, vulgar superstition to the contrary. If your monarch was\r\nsufficiently convinced of the innocence of our religion to protect us\r\nfrom the persecution of the ignorant, then certainly one of his subjects\r\nneed have no apprehensions.'\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' demanded Conan.\r\n\r\n'I am Hadrathus, priest of Asura. One of my followers recognized you\r\nwhen you entered the city, and brought the word to me.'\r\n\r\nConan grunted profanely.\r\n\r\n'Do not fear that others discovered your identity,' Hadrathus assured\r\nhim. 'Your disguise would have deceived any but a follower of Asura,\r\nwhose cult it is to seek below the aspect of illusion. You were followed\r\nto the watch tower, and some of my people went into the tunnel to aid\r\nyou if you returned by that route. Others, myself among them, surrounded\r\nthe tower. And now, King Conan, it is yours to command. Here in the\r\ntemple of Asura you are still king.'\r\n\r\n'Why should you risk your lives for me?' asked the king.\r\n\r\n'You were our friend when you sat upon your throne,' answered Hadrathus.\r\n'You protected us when the priests of Mitra sought to scourge us out of\r\nthe land.'\r\n\r\nConan looked about him curiously. He had never before visited the temple\r\nof Asura, had not certainly known that there was such a temple in\r\nTarantia. The priests of the religion had a habit of hiding their\r\ntemples in a remarkable fashion. The worship of Mitra was overwhelmingly\r\npredominant in the Hyborian nations, but the cult of Asura persisted, in\r\nspite of official ban and popular antagonism. Conan had been told dark\r\ntales of hidden temples where intense smoke drifted up incessantly from\r\nblack altars where kidnapped humans were sacrificed before a great\r\ncoiled serpent, whose fearsome head swayed for ever in the haunted\r\nshadows.\r\n\r\nPersecution caused the followers of Asura to hide their temples with\r\ncunning art, and to veil their rituals in obscurity; and this secrecy,\r\nin turn, evoked more monstrous suspicions and tales of evil.\r\n\r\nBut Conan's was the broad tolerance of the barbarian, and he had refused\r\nto persecute the followers of Asura or to allow the people to do so on\r\nno better evidence than was presented against them, rumors and\r\naccusations that could not be proven. 'If they are black magicians,' he\r\nhad said, 'how will they suffer you to harry them? If they are not,\r\nthere is no evil in them. Crom's devils! Let men worship what gods they\r\nwill.'\r\n\r\nAt a respectful invitation from Hadrathus he seated himself on an ivory\r\nchair, and motioned Albiona to another, but she preferred to sit on a\r\ngolden stool at his feet, pressing close against his thigh, as if\r\nseeking security in the contact. Like most orthodox followers of Mitra,\r\nshe had an intuitive horror of the followers and cult of Asura,\r\ninstilled in her infancy and childhood by wild tales of human sacrifice\r\nand anthropomorphic gods shambling through shadowy temples.\r\n\r\nHadrathus stood before them, his uncovered head bowed.\r\n\r\n'What is your wish, your Majesty?'\r\n\r\n'Food first,' he grunted, and the priest smote a golden gong with a\r\nsilver wand.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the mellow notes ceased echoing when four hooded figures\r\ncame through a curtained doorway bearing a great four-legged silver\r\nplatter of smoking dishes and crystal vessels. This they set before\r\nConan, bowing low, and the king wiped his hands on the damask, and\r\nsmacked his lips with unconcealed relish.\r\n\r\n'Beware, your Majesty!' whispered Albiona. 'These folk eat human flesh!'\r\n\r\n'I'll stake my kingdom that this is nothing but honest roast beef,'\r\nanswered Conan. 'Come, lass, fall to! You must be hungry after the\r\nprison fare.'\r\n\r\nThus advised, and with the example before her of one whose word was the\r\nultimate law to her, the countess complied, and ate ravenously though\r\ndaintily, while her liege lord tore into the meat joints and guzzled the\r\nwine with as much gusto as if he had not already eaten once that night.\r\n\r\n'You priests are shrewd, Hadrathus,' he said, with a great beef-bone in\r\nhis hands and his mouth full of meat. 'I'd welcome your service in my\r\ncampaign to regain my kingdom.'\r\n\r\nSlowly Hadrathus shook his head, and Conan slammed the beef-bone down on\r\nthe table in a gust of impatient wrath.\r\n\r\n'Crom's devils! What ails the men of Aquilonia? First Servius--now you!\r\nCan you do nothing but wag your idiotic heads when I speak of ousting\r\nthese dogs?'\r\n\r\nHadrathus sighed and answered slowly: 'My lord, it is ill to say, and I\r\nfain would say otherwise. But the freedom of Aquilonia is at an end.\r\nNay, the freedom of the whole world may be at an end! Age follows age in\r\nthe history of the world, and now we enter an age of horror and slavery,\r\nas it was long ago.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' demanded the king uneasily.\r\n\r\nHadrathus dropped into a chair and rested his elbows on his thighs,\r\nstaring at the floor.\r\n\r\n'It is not alone the rebellious lords of Aquilonia and the armies of\r\nNemedia which are arrayed against you,' answered Hadrathus. 'It is\r\nsorcery--grisly black magic from the grim youth of the world. An awful\r\nshape has risen out of the shades of the Past, and none can stand before\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' Conan repeated.\r\n\r\n'I speak of Xaltotun of Acheron, who died three thousand years ago, yet\r\nwalks the earth today.'\r\n\r\nConan was silent, while in his mind floated an image--the image of a\r\nbearded face of calm inhuman beauty. Again he was haunted by a sense of\r\nuneasy familiarity. Acheron--the sound of the word roused instinctive\r\nvibrations of memory and associations in his mind.\r\n\r\n'Acheron,' he repeated. 'Xaltotun of Acheron--man, are you mad? Acheron\r\nhas been a myth for more centuries than I can remember. I've often\r\nwondered if it ever existed at all.'\r\n\r\n'It was a black reality,' answered Hadrathus, 'an empire of black\r\nmagicians, steeped in evil now long forgotten. It was finally overthrown\r\nby the Hyborian tribes of the west. The wizards of Acheron practised\r\nfoul necromancy, thaumaturgy of the most evil kind, grisly magic taught\r\nthem by devils. And of all the sorcerers of that accursed kingdom, none\r\nwas so great as Xaltotun of Python.'\r\n\r\n'Then how was he ever overthrown?' asked Conan skeptically.\r\n\r\n'By some means a source of cosmic power which he jealously guarded was\r\nstolen and turned against him. That source has been returned to him, and\r\nhe is invincible.'\r\n\r\nAlbiona, hugging the headsman's black cloak about her, stared from the\r\npriest to the king, not understanding the conversation. Conan shook his\r\nhead angrily.\r\n\r\n'You are making game of me,' he growled. 'If Xaltotun has been dead\r\nthree thousand years, how can this man be he? It's some rogue who's\r\ntaken the old one's name.'\r\n\r\nHadrathus leaned to an ivory table and opened a small gold chest which\r\nstood there. From it he took something which glinted dully in the mellow\r\nlight--a broad gold coin of antique minting.\r\n\r\n'You have seen Xaltotun unveiled? Then look upon this. It is a coin\r\nwhich was stamped in ancient Acheron, before its fall. So pervaded with\r\nsorcery was that black empire, that even this coin has its uses in\r\nmaking magic.'\r\n\r\nConan took it and scowled down at it. There was no mistaking its great\r\nantiquity. Conan had handled many coins in the years of his plunderings,\r\nand had a good practical knowledge of them. The edges were worn and the\r\ninscription almost obliterated. But the countenance stamped on one side\r\nwas still clear-cut and distinct. And Conan's breath sucked in between\r\nhis clenched teeth. It was not cool in the chamber, but he felt a\r\nprickling of his scalp, an icy contraction of his flesh. The countenance\r\nwas that of a bearded man, inscrutable, with a calm inhuman beauty.\r\n\r\n'By Crom! It's he!' muttered Conan. He understood, now, the sense of\r\nfamiliarity that the sight of the bearded man had roused in him from the\r\nfirst. He had seen a coin like this once before, long ago in a far land.\r\n\r\nWith a shake of his shoulders he growled: 'The likeness is only a\r\ncoincidence--or if he's shrewd enough to assume a forgotten wizard's\r\nname, he's shrewd enough to assume his likeness.' But he spoke without\r\nconviction. The sight of that coin had shaken the foundations of his\r\nuniverse. He felt that reality and stability were crumbing into an abyss\r\nof illusion and sorcery. A wizard was understandable; but this was\r\ndiabolism beyond sanity.\r\n\r\n'We cannot doubt that it is indeed Xaltotun of Python,' said Hadrathus.\r\n'He it was who shook down the cliffs at Valkia, by his spells that\r\nenthrall the elementals of the earth--he it was who sent the creature of\r\ndarkness into your tent before dawn.'\r\n\r\nConan scowled at him. 'How did you know that?'\r\n\r\n'The followers of Asura have secret channels of knowledge. That does not\r\nmatter. But do you realize the futility of sacrificing your subjects in\r\na vain attempt to regain your crown?'\r\n\r\nConan rested his chin on his fist, and stared grimly into nothing.\r\nAlbiona watched him anxiously, her mind groping bewildered in the mazes\r\nof the problem that confronted him.\r\n\r\n'Is there no wizard in the world who could make magic to fight\r\nXaltotun's magic?' he asked at last.\r\n\r\nHadrathus shook his head. 'If there were, we of Asura would know of him.\r\nMen say our cult is a survival of the ancient Stygian serpent-worship.\r\nThat is a lie. Our ancestors came from Vendhya, beyond the Sea of\r\nVilayet and the blue Himelian mountains. We are sons of the East, not\r\nthe South, and we have knowledge of all the wizards of the East, who are\r\ngreater than the wizards of the West. And not one of them but would be a\r\nstraw in the wind before the black might of Xaltotun.'\r\n\r\n'But he was conquered once,' persisted Conan.\r\n\r\n'Aye; a cosmic source was turned against him. But now that source is\r\nagain in his hands, and he will see that it is not stolen again.'\r\n\r\n'And what is this damnable source?' demanded Conan irritably.\r\n\r\n'It is called the Heart of Ahriman. When Acheron was overthrown, the\r\nprimitive priest who had stolen it and turned it against Xaltotun hid it\r\nin a haunted cavern and built a small temple over the cavern. Thrice\r\nthereafter the temple was rebuilt, each time greater and more\r\nelaborately than before, but always on the site of the original shrine,\r\nthough men forgot the reason therefor. Memory of the hidden symbol faded\r\nfrom the minds of common men, and was preserved only in priestly books\r\nand esoteric volumes. Whence it came no one knows. Some say it is the\r\nveritable heart of a god, others that it is a star that fell from the\r\nskies long ago. Until it was stolen, none had looked upon it for three\r\nthousand years.\r\n\r\n'When the magic of the Mitran priests failed against the magic of\r\nXaltotun's acolyte, Altaro, they remembered the ancient legend of the\r\nheart, and the high priest and an acolyte went down into the dark and\r\nterrible crypt below the temple into which no priest had descended for\r\nthree thousand years. In the ancient iron-bound volumes which speak of\r\nthe Heart in their cryptic symbolism, it is also told of a creature of\r\ndarkness left by the ancient priest to guard it.\r\n\r\n'Far down in a square chamber with arched doorways leading off into\r\nimmeasurable blackness, the priest and his acolytes found a black stone\r\naltar that glowed dimly with inexplicable radiance.\r\n\r\n'On that altar lay a curious gold vessel like a double-valved sea-shell\r\nwhich clung to the stone like a barnacle. But it gaped open and empty.\r\nThe Heart of Ahriman was gone. While they stared in horror, the keeper\r\nof the crypt, the creature of darkness, came upon them and mangled the\r\nhigh priest so that he died. But the acolyte fought off the being--a\r\nmindless, soulless waif of the pits brought long ago to guard the\r\nHeart--and escaped up the long black narrow stairs carrying the dying\r\npriest, who before he died, gasped out the news to his followers, bade\r\nthem submit to a power they could not overcome, and commanded secrecy.\r\nBut the word has been whispered about among the priests, and we of Asura\r\nlearned of it.'\r\n\r\n'And Xaltotun draws his power from this symbol?' asked Conan, still\r\nskeptical.\r\n\r\n'No. His power is drawn from the black gulf. But the Heart of Ahriman\r\ncame from some far universe of flaming light, and against it the powers\r\nof darkness cannot stand, when it is in the hands of an adept. It is\r\nlike a sword that might smite at him, not a sword with which he can\r\nsmite. It restores life, and can destroy life. He has stolen it, not to\r\nuse against his enemies, but to keep them from using it against him.'\r\n\r\n'A shell-shaped bowl of gold on a black altar in a deep cavern,' Conan\r\nmuttered, frowning as he sought to capture the illusive image. 'That\r\nreminds me of something I have heard or seen. But what, in Crom's name,\r\nis this notable Heart?'\r\n\r\n'It is in the form of a great jewel, like a ruby, but pulsing with\r\nblinding fire with which no ruby ever burned. It glows like living\r\nflame--'\r\n\r\nBut Conan sprang suddenly up and smote his right fist into his left palm\r\nlike a thunderclap.\r\n\r\n'Crom!' he roared, 'What a fool I've been! The Heart of Ahriman! The\r\nheart of my kingdom! Find the heart of my kingdom, Zelata said. By Ymir,\r\nit was the jewel I saw in the green smoke, the jewel which Tarascus\r\nstole from Xaltotun while he lay in the sleep of the black lotus!'\r\n\r\nHadrathus was also on his feet, his calm dropped from him like a\r\ngarment.\r\n\r\n'What are you saying? The Heart stolen from Xaltotun?'\r\n\r\n'Aye!' Conan boomed. 'Tarascus feared Xaltotun and wanted to cripple his\r\npower, which he thought resided in the Heart. Maybe he thought the\r\nwizard would die if the Heart was lost. By Crom--ahhh!' With a savage\r\ngrimace of disappointment and disgust he dropped his clenched hand to\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\n'I forgot. Tarascus gave it to a thief to throw into the sea. By this\r\ntime the fellow must be almost to Kordava. Before I can follow him he'll\r\ntake ship and consign the Heart to the bottom of the ocean.'\r\n\r\n'The sea will not hold it!' exclaimed Hadrathus, quivering with\r\nexcitement. 'Xaltotun would himself have cast it into the ocean long\r\nago, had he not known that the first storm would carry it ashore. But on\r\nwhat unknown beach might it not land!'\r\n\r\n'Well,' Conan was recovering some of his resilient confidence, 'there's\r\nno assurance that the thief will throw it away. If I know thieves--and I\r\nshould, for I was a thief in Zamora in my early youth--he won't throw it\r\naway. He'll sell it to some rich trader. By Crom!' he strode back and\r\nforth in his growing excitement. 'It's worth looking for! Zelata bade me\r\nfind the heart of my kingdom, and all else she showed me proved to be\r\ntruth. Can it be that the power to conquer Xaltotun lurks in that\r\ncrimson bauble?'\r\n\r\n'Aye! My head upon it!' cried Hadrathus, his face lightened with fervor,\r\nhis eyes blazing, his fists clenched. 'With it in our hands we can dare\r\nthe powers of Xaltotun! I swear it! If we can recover it, we have an\r\neven chance of recovering your crown and driving the invaders from our\r\nportals. It is not the swords of Nemedia that Aquilonia fears, but the\r\nblack arts of Xaltotun.'\r\n\r\nConan looked at him for a space, impressed by the priest's fire.\r\n\r\n'It's like a quest in a nightmare,' he said at last. 'Yet your words\r\necho the thought of Zelata, and all else she said was truth. I'll seek\r\nfor this jewel.'\r\n\r\n'It holds the destiny of Aquilonia,' said Hadrathus with conviction. 'I\r\nwill send men with you--'\r\n\r\n'Nay!' exclaimed the king impatiently, not caring to be hampered by\r\npriests on his quest, however skilled in esoteric arts. 'This is a task\r\nfor a fighting man. I go alone. First to Poitain, where I'll leave\r\nAlbiona with Trocero. Then to Kordava, and to the sea beyond, if\r\nnecessary. It may be that, even if the thief intends carrying out\r\nTarascus' order, he'll have some difficulty finding an outbound ship at\r\nthis time of the year.'\r\n\r\n'And if you find the Heart,' cried Hadrathus, 'I will prepare the way\r\nfor your conquest. Before you return to Aquilonia I will spread the word\r\nthrough secret channels that you live and are returning with a magic\r\nstronger than Xaltotun's. I will have men ready to rise on your return.\r\nThey will rise, if they have assurance that they will be protected from\r\nthe black arts of Xaltotun.\r\n\r\n'And I will aid you on your journey.'\r\n\r\nHe rose and struck a gong.\r\n\r\n'A secret tunnel leads from beneath this temple to a place outside the\r\ncity wall. You shall go to Poitain on a pilgrim's boat. None will dare\r\nmolest you.'\r\n\r\n'As you will.' With a definite purpose in mind Conan was afire with\r\nimpatience and dynamic energy. 'Only let it be done swiftly.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime events were moving not slowly elsewhere in the city. A\r\nbreathless messenger had burst into the palace where Valerius was\r\namusing himself with his dancing-girls, and throwing himself on his\r\nknee, gasped out a garbled story of a bloody prison break and the escape\r\nof a lovely captive. He bore also the news that Count Thespius, to whom\r\nthe execution of Albiona's sentence had been entrusted, was dying and\r\nbegging for a word with Valerius before he passed.\r\n\r\nHurriedly cloaking himself, Valerius accompanied the man through various\r\nwinding ways, and came to a chamber where Thespius lay. There was no\r\ndoubt that the count was dying; bloody froth bubbled from his lips at\r\neach shuddering gasp. His severed arm had been bound to stop the flow of\r\nblood, but even without that, the gash in his side was mortal.\r\n\r\nAlone in the chamber with the dying man, Valerius swore softly.\r\n\r\n'By Mitra, I had believed that only one man ever lived who could strike\r\nsuch a blow.'\r\n\r\n'Valerius!' gasped the dying man. 'He lives! Conan lives!'\r\n\r\n'What are you saying?' ejaculated the other.\r\n\r\n'I swear by Mitra!' gurgled Thespius, gagging on the blood that gushed\r\nto his lips. 'It was he who carried off Albiona! He is not dead--no\r\nphantom come back from hell to haunt us. He is flesh and blood, and more\r\nterrible than ever. The alley behind the tower is full of dead men.\r\nBeware, Valerius--he has come back--to slay us all--'\r\n\r\nA strong shudder shook the blood-smeared figure, and Count Thespius went\r\nlimp.\r\n\r\nValerius frowned down at the dead man, cast a swift glance about the\r\nempty chamber, and stepping swiftly to the door, cast it open suddenly.\r\nThe messenger and a group of Nemedian guardsmen stood several paces down\r\nthe corridor. Valerius muttered something that might have indicated\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n'Have all the gates been closed?' he demanded.\r\n\r\n'Yes, your Majesty.'\r\n\r\n'Triple the guards at each. Let no one enter or leave the city without\r\nstrictest investigation. Set men scouring the streets and searching the\r\nquarters. A very valuable prisoner has escaped, with the aid of an\r\nAquilonian rebel. Did any of you recognize the man?'\r\n\r\n'No, your Majesty. The old watchman had a glimpse of him, but could only\r\nsay that he was a giant, clad in the black garb of the executioner,\r\nwhose naked body we found in an empty cell.'\r\n\r\n'He is a dangerous man,' said Valerius. 'Take no chances with him. You\r\nall know the Countess Albiona. Search for her, and if you find her, kill\r\nher and her companion instantly. Do not try to take them alive.'\r\n\r\nReturning to his palace chamber, Valerius summoned before him four men\r\nof curious and alien aspect. They were tall, gaunt, of yellowish skin,\r\nand immobile countenances. They were very similar in appearance, clad\r\nalike in long black robes beneath which their sandaled feet were just\r\nvisible. Their features were shadowed by their hoods. They stood before\r\nValerius with their hands in their wide sleeves; their arms folded.\r\nValerius looked at them without pleasure. In his far journeyings he had\r\nencountered many strange races.\r\n\r\n'When I found you starving in the Khitan jungles,' he said abruptly,\r\n'exiles from your kingdom, you swore to serve me. You have served me\r\nwell enough, in your abominable way. One more service I require, and\r\nthen I set you free of your oath.\r\n\r\n'Conan the Cimmerian, king of Aquilonia, still lives, in spite of\r\nXaltotun's sorcery--or perhaps because of it. I know not. The dark mind\r\nof that resurrected devil is too devious and subtle for a mortal man to\r\nfathom. But while Conan lives I am not safe. The people accepted me as\r\nthe lesser of two evils, when they thought he was dead. Let him reappear\r\nand the throne will be rocking under my feet in revolution before I can\r\nlift my hand.\r\n\r\n'Perhaps my allies mean to use him to replace me, if they decide I have\r\nserved my purpose. I do not know. I do know that this planet is too\r\nsmall for two kings of Aquilonia. Seek the Cimmerian. Use your uncanny\r\ntalents to ferret him out wherever he hides or runs. He has many friends\r\nin Tarantia. He had aid when he carried off Albiona. It took more than\r\none man, even such a man as Conan, to wreak all that slaughter in the\r\nalley outside the tower. But no more. Take your staffs and strike his\r\ntrail. Where that trail will lead you, I know not. But find him! And\r\nwhen you find him, slay him!'\r\n\r\nThe four Khitans bowed together, and still unspeaking, turned and padded\r\nnoiselessly from the chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\nSwords of the South\r\n\r\n\r\nDawn that rose over the distant hills shone on the sails of a small\r\ncraft that dropped down the river which curves to within a mile of the\r\nwalls of Tarantia, and loops southward like a great shining serpent.\r\nThis boat differed from the ordinary craft plying the broad\r\nKhorotas--fishermen and merchant barges loaded with rich goods. It was\r\nlong and slender, with a high, curving prow, and was black as ebony,\r\nwith white skulls painted along the gunwales. Amidships rose a small\r\ncabin, the windows closely masked. Other craft gave the ominously\r\npainted boat a wide berth; for it was obviously one of those 'pilgrim\r\nboats' that carried a lifeless follower of Asura on his last mysterious\r\npilgrimage southward to where, far beyond the Poitanian mountains, a\r\nriver flowed at last into the blue ocean. In that cabin undoubtedly lay\r\nthe corpse of the departed worshipper. All men were familiar with the\r\nsight of those gloomy craft; and the most fanatical votary of Mitra\r\nwould not dare touch or interfere with their somber voyages.\r\n\r\nWhere the ultimate destination lay, men did not know. Some said Stygia;\r\nsome a nameless island lying beyond the horizon; others said it was in\r\nthe glamorous and mysterious land of Vendhya where the dead came home at\r\nlast. But none knew certainly. They only knew that when a follower of\r\nAsura died, the corpse went southward down the great river, in a black\r\nboat rowed by a giant slave, and neither boat nor corpse nor slave was\r\never seen again; unless, indeed, certain dark tales were true, and it\r\nwas always the same slave who rowed the boats southward.\r\n\r\nThe man who propelled this particular boat was as huge and brown as the\r\nothers, though closer scrutiny might have revealed the fact that the hue\r\nwas the result of carefully applied pigments. He was clad in leather\r\nloin-cloth and sandals, and he handled the long sweep and oars with\r\nunusual skill and power. But none approached the grim boat closely, for\r\nit was well known that the followers of Asura were accursed, and that\r\nthese pilgrim boats were loaded with dark magic. So men swung their\r\nboats wide and muttered an incantation as the dark craft slid past, and\r\nthey never dreamed that they were thus assisting in the flight of their\r\nking and the Countess Albiona.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange journey, in that black, slim craft down the great river\r\nfor nearly two hundred miles to where the Khorotas swings eastward,\r\nskirting the Poitanian mountains. Like a dream the ever-changing\r\npanorama glided past. During the day Albiona lay patiently in the little\r\ncabin, as quietly as the corpse she pretended to be. Only late at night,\r\nafter the pleasure boats with their fair occupants lounging on silken\r\ncushions in the flare of torches held by slaves had left the river,\r\nbefore dawn brought the hurrying fisherboats, did the girl venture out.\r\nThen she held the long sweep, cunningly bound in place by ropes to aid\r\nher, while Conan snatched a few hours of sleep. But the king needed\r\nlittle rest. The fire of his desire drove him relentlessly; and his\r\npowerful frame was equal to the grinding test. Without halt or pause\r\nthey drove southward.\r\n\r\nSo down the river they fled, through nights when the flowing current\r\nmirrored the million stars, and through days of golden sunlight, leaving\r\nwinter behind them as they sped southward. They passed cities in the\r\nnight, above which throbbed and pulsed the reflection of the myriad\r\nlights, lordly river villas and fertile groves. So at last the blue\r\nmountains of Poitain rose above them, tier above tier, like ramparts of\r\nthe gods, and the great river, swerving from those turreted cliffs,\r\nswept thunderously through the marching hills with many a rapid and\r\nfoaming cataract.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConan scanned the shoreline closely, and finally swung the long sweep\r\nand headed inshore at a point where a neck of land jutted into the\r\nwater, and fir trees grew in a curiously symmetrical ring about a gray,\r\nstrangely shaped rock.\r\n\r\n'How these boats ride those falls we hear roaring ahead of us is more\r\nthan I can see,' he grunted. 'Hadrathus said they did--but here's where\r\nwe halt. He said a man would be waiting for us with horses, but I don't\r\nsee anyone. How word of our coming could have preceded us I don't know\r\nanyway.'\r\n\r\nHe drove inshore and bound the prow to an arching root in the low bank,\r\nand then, plunging into the water, washed the brown paint from his skin\r\nand emerged dripping, and in his natural color. From the cabin he\r\nbrought forth a suit of Aquilonian ring-mail which Hadrathus had\r\nprocured for him, and his sword. These he donned while Albiona put on\r\ngarments suitable for mountain travel. And when Conan was fully armed,\r\nand turned to look toward the shore, he started and his hand went to his\r\nsword. For on the shore, under the trees, stood a black-cloaked figure\r\nholding the reins of a white palfrey and a bay war-horse.\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' demanded the king.\r\n\r\nThe other bowed low.\r\n\r\n'A follower of Asura. A command came. I obeyed.'\r\n\r\n'How, \"came\"?' inquired Conan, but the other merely bowed again.\r\n\r\n'I have come to guide you through the mountains to the first Poitanian\r\nstronghold.'\r\n\r\n'I don't need a guide,' answered Conan. 'I know these hills well. I\r\nthank you for the horses, but the countess and I will attract less\r\nattention alone than if we were accompanied by an acolyte of Asura.'\r\n\r\nThe man bowed profoundly, and giving the reins into Conan's hands,\r\nstepped into the boat. Casting off, he floated down the swift current,\r\ntoward the distant roar of the unseen rapids. With a baffled shake of\r\nhis head, Conan lifted the countess into the palfrey's saddle, and then\r\nmounted the war-horse and reined toward the summits that castellated the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nThe rolling country at the foot of the towering mountains was now a\r\nborderland, in a state of turmoil, where the barons reverted to feudal\r\npractises, and bands of outlaws roamed unhindered. Poitain had not\r\nformally declared her separation from Aquilonia, but she was now, to all\r\nintents, a self-contained kingdom, ruled by her hereditary count,\r\nTrocero. The rolling south country had submitted nominally to Valerius,\r\nbut he had not attempted to force the passes guarded by strongholds\r\nwhere the crimson leopard banner of Poitain waved defiantly.\r\n\r\nThe king and his fair companion rode up the long blue slopes in the soft\r\nevening. As they mounted higher, the rolling country spread out like a\r\nvast purple mantle far beneath them, shot with the shine of rivers and\r\nlakes, the yellow glint of broad fields, and the white gleam of distant\r\ntowers. Ahead of them and far above, they glimpsed the first of the\r\nPoitanian holds--a strong fortress dominating a narrow pass, the crimson\r\nbanner streaming against the clear blue sky.\r\n\r\nBefore they reached it, a band of knights in burnished armor rode from\r\namong the trees, and their leader sternly ordered the travelers to halt.\r\nThey were tall men, with the dark eyes and raven locks of the south.\r\n\r\n'Halt, sir, and state your business, and why you ride toward Poitain.'\r\n\r\n'Is Poitain in revolt then,' asked Conan, watching the other closely,\r\n'that a man in Aquilonian harness is halted and questioned like a\r\nforeigner?'\r\n\r\n'Many rogues ride out of Aquilonia these days,' answered the other\r\ncoldly. 'As for revolt, if you mean the repudiation of a usurper, then\r\nPoitain is in revolt. We had rather serve the memory of a dead man than\r\nthe scepter of a living dog.'\r\n\r\nConan swept off his helmet, and shaking back his black mane, stared full\r\nat the speaker. The Poitanian stared violently and went livid.\r\n\r\n'Saints of heaven!' he gasped. 'It is the king--alive!'\r\n\r\nThe others stared wildly, then a roar of wonder and joy burst from them.\r\nThey swarmed about Conan, shouting their war-cries and brandishing their\r\nswords in their extreme emotion. The acclaim of Poitanian warriors was a\r\nthing to terrify a timid man.\r\n\r\n'Oh, but Trocero will weep tears of joy to see you, sire!' cried one.\r\n\r\n'Aye, and Prospero!' shouted another. 'The general has been like one\r\nwrapped in a mantle of melancholy, and curses himself night and day that\r\nhe did not reach the Valkia in time to die beside his king!'\r\n\r\n'Now we will strike for empery!' yelled another, whirling his great\r\nsword about his head. 'Hail, Conan, king of Poitain!'\r\n\r\nThe clangor of bright steel about him and the thunder of their acclaim\r\nfrightened the birds that rose in gay-hued clouds from the surrounding\r\ntrees. The hot southern blood was afire, and they desired nothing but\r\nfor their new-found sovereign to lead them to battle and pillage.\r\n\r\n'What is your command, sire?' they cried. 'Let one of us ride ahead and\r\nbear the news of your coming into Poitain! Banners will wave from every\r\ntower, roses will carpet the road before your horse's feet, and all the\r\nbeauty and chivalry of the south will give you the honor due you--'\r\n\r\nConan shook his head.\r\n\r\n'Who could doubt your loyalty? But winds blow over these mountains into\r\nthe countries of my enemies, and I would rather these didn't know that I\r\nlived--yet. Take me to Trocero, and keep my identity a secret.'\r\n\r\nSo what the knights would have made a triumphal procession was more in\r\nthe nature of a secret flight. They traveled in haste, speaking to no\r\none, except for a whisper to the captain on duty at each pass; and Conan\r\nrode among them with his vizor lowered.\r\n\r\nThe mountains were uninhabited save by outlaws and garrisons of soldiers\r\nwho guarded the passes. The pleasure-loving Poitanians had no need nor\r\ndesire to wrest a hard and scanty living from their stern breasts. South\r\nof the ranges the rich and beautiful plains of Poitain stretched to the\r\nriver Alimane; but beyond the river lay the land of Zingara.\r\n\r\nEven now, when winter was crisping the leaves beyond the mountains, the\r\ntall rich grass waved upon the plains where grazed the horses and cattle\r\nfor which Poitain was famed. Palm trees and orange groves smiled in the\r\nsun, and the gorgeous purple and gold and crimson towers of castles and\r\ncities reflected the golden light. It was a land of warmth and plenty,\r\nof beautiful men and ferocious warriors. It is not only the hard lands\r\nthat breed hard men. Poitain was surrounded by covetous neighbors and\r\nher sons learned hardihood in incessant wars. To the north the land was\r\nguarded by the mountains, but to the south only the Alimane separated\r\nthe plains of Poitain from the plains of Zingara, and not once but a\r\nthousand times had that river run red. To the east lay Argos and beyond\r\nthat Ophir, proud kingdoms and avaricious. The knights of Poitain held\r\ntheir lands by the weight and edge of their swords, and little of ease\r\nand idleness they knew.\r\n\r\nSo Conan came presently to the castle of Count Trocero....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConan sat on a silken divan in a rich chamber whose filmy curtains the\r\nwarm breeze billowed. Trocero paced the floor like a panther, a lithe,\r\nrestless man with the waist of a woman and the shoulders of a swordsman,\r\nwho carried his years lightly.\r\n\r\n'Let us proclaim you king of Poitain!' urged the count. 'Let those\r\nnorthern pigs wear the yoke to which they have bent their necks. The\r\nsouth is still yours. Dwell here and rule us, amid the flowers and the\r\npalms.'\r\n\r\nBut Conan shook his head. 'There is no nobler land on earth than\r\nPoitain. But it cannot stand alone, bold as are its sons.'\r\n\r\n'It _did_ stand alone for generations,' retorted Trocero, with the quick\r\njealous pride of his breed. 'We were not always a part of Aquilonia.'\r\n\r\n'I know. But conditions are not as they were then, when all kingdoms\r\nwere broken into principalities which warred with each other. The days\r\nof dukedoms and free cities are past, the days of empires are upon us.\r\nRulers are dreaming imperial dreams, and only in unity is there\r\nstrength.'\r\n\r\n'Then let us unite Zingara with Poitain,' argued Trocero. 'Half a dozen\r\nprinces strive against each other, and the country is torn asunder by\r\ncivil wars. We will conquer it, province by province, and add it to your\r\ndominions. Then with the aid of the Zingarans we will conquer Argos and\r\nOphir. We will build an empire--'\r\n\r\nAgain Conan shook his head. 'Let others dream imperial dreams. I but\r\nwish to hold what is mine. I have no desire to rule an empire welded\r\ntogether by blood and fire. It's one thing to seize a throne with the\r\naid of its subjects and rule them with their consent. It's another to\r\nsubjugate a foreign realm and rule it by fear. I don't wish to be\r\nanother Valerius. No, Trocero, I'll rule all Aquilonia and no more, or\r\nI'll rule nothing.'\r\n\r\n'Then lead us over the mountains and we will smite the Nemedians.'\r\n\r\nConan's fierce eyes glowed with appreciation.\r\n\r\n'No, Trocero. It would be a vain sacrifice. I've told you what I must do\r\nto regain my kingdom. I must find the Heart of Ahriman.'\r\n\r\n'But this is madness!' protested Trocero, 'The maunderings of a\r\nheretical priest, the mumblings of a mad witch-woman.'\r\n\r\n'You were not in my tent before Valkia,' answered Conan grimly,\r\ninvoluntarily glancing at his right wrist, on which blue marks still\r\nshowed faintly. 'You didn't see the cliffs thunder down to crush the\r\nflower of my army. No, Trocero, I've been convinced. Xaltotun's no\r\nmortal man, and only with the Heart of Ahriman can I stand against him.\r\nSo I'm riding to Kordava, alone.'\r\n\r\n'But that is dangerous,' protested Trocero.\r\n\r\n'Life is dangerous,' rumbled the king. 'I won't go as king of Aquilonia,\r\nor even as a knight of Poitain, but as a wandering mercenary, as I rode\r\nin Zingara in the old days. Oh, I have enemies enough south of the\r\nAlimane, in the lands and the waters of the south. Many who won't know\r\nme as king of Aquilonia will remember me as Conan of the Barachan\r\npirates, or Amra of the black corsairs. But I have friends, too, and men\r\nwho'll aid me for their own private reasons.' A faintly reminiscent grin\r\ntouched his lips.\r\n\r\nTrocero dropped his hands helplessly and glanced at Albiona, who sat on\r\na near-by divan.\r\n\r\n'I understand your doubts, my lord,' said she. 'But I too saw the coin\r\nin the temple of Asura, and look you, Hadrathus said it was dated five\r\nhundred years _before_ the fall of Acheron. If Xaltotun, then, is the\r\nman pictured on the coin, as his Majesty swears he is, that means he was\r\nno common wizard, even in his other life, for the years of his life were\r\nnumbered by centuries, not as the lives of other men are numbered.'\r\n\r\nBefore Trocero could reply, a respectful rap was heard on the door and a\r\nvoice called: 'My lord, we have caught a man skulking about the castle,\r\nwho says he wishes to speak with your guest. I await your orders.'\r\n\r\n'A spy from Aquilonia!' hissed Trocero, catching at his dagger, but\r\nConan lifted his voice and called: 'Open the door and let me see him.'\r\n\r\nThe door was opened and a man was framed in it, grasped on either hand\r\nby stern-looking men-at-arms. He was a slender man, clad in a dark\r\nhooded robe.\r\n\r\n'Are you a follower of Asura?' asked Conan.\r\n\r\nThe man nodded, and the stalwart men-at-arms looked shocked and glanced\r\nhesitantly at Trocero.\r\n\r\n'The word came southward,' said the man. 'Beyond the Alimane we can not\r\naid you, for our sect goes no farther southward, but stretches eastward\r\nwith the Khorotas. But this I have learned: the thief who took the Heart\r\nof Ahriman from Tarascus never reached Kordava. In the mountains of\r\nPoitain he was slain by robbers. The jewel fell into the hands of their\r\nchief, who, not knowing its true nature, and being harried after the\r\ndestruction of his band by Poitanian knights, sold it to the Kothic\r\nmerchant Zorathus.'\r\n\r\n'Ha!' Conan was on his feet, galvanized. 'And what of Zorathus?'\r\n\r\n'Four days ago he crossed the Alimane, headed for Argos, with a small\r\nband of armed servants.'\r\n\r\n'He's a fool to cross Zingara in such times,' said Trocero.\r\n\r\n'Aye, times are troublous across the river. But Zorathus is a bold man,\r\nand reckless in his way. He is in great haste to reach Messantia, where\r\nhe hopes to find a buyer for the jewel. Perhaps he hopes to sell it\r\nfinally in Stygia. Perhaps he guesses at its true nature. At any rate,\r\ninstead of following the long road that winds along the borders of\r\nPoitain and so at last comes into Argos far from Messantia, he has\r\nstruck straight across eastern Zingara, following the shorter and more\r\ndirect route.'\r\n\r\nConan smote the table with his clenched fist so that the great board\r\nquivered.\r\n\r\n'Then, by Crom, fortune has at last thrown the dice for me! A horse,\r\nTrocero, and the harness of a Free Companion! Zorathus has a long start,\r\nbut not too long for me to overtake him, if I follow him to the end of\r\nthe world!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\nThe Fang of the Dragon\r\n\r\n\r\nAt dawn Conan waded his horse across the shallows of the Alimane and\r\nstruck the wide caravan trail which ran southeastward, and behind him,\r\non the farther bank, Trocero sat his horse silently at the head of his\r\nsteel-clad knights, with the crimson leopard of Poitain floating its\r\nlong folds over him in the morning breeze. Silently they sat, those\r\ndark-haired men in shining steel, until the figure of their king had\r\nvanished in the blue of distance that whitened toward sunrise.\r\n\r\nConan rode a great black stallion, the gift of Trocero. He no longer\r\nwore the armor of Aquilonia. His harness proclaimed him a veteran of\r\nthe Free Companies, who were of all races. His headpiece was a plain\r\nmorion, dented and battered. The leather and mail-mesh of his hauberk\r\nwere worn and shiny as if by many campaigns, and the scarlet cloak\r\nflowing carelessly from his mailed shoulders was tattered and stained.\r\nHe looked the part of the hired fighting-man, who had known all\r\nvicissitudes of fortune, plunder and wealth one day, an empty purse and\r\na close-drawn belt the next.\r\n\r\nAnd more than looking the part, he felt the part; the awakening of old\r\nmemories, the resurge of the wild, mad, glorious days of old before his\r\nfeet were set on the imperial path when he was a wandering mercenary,\r\nroistering, brawling, guzzling, adventuring, with no thought for the\r\nmorrow, and no desire save sparkling ale, red lips, and a keen sword to\r\nswing on all the battlefields of the world.\r\n\r\nUnconsciously he reverted to the old ways; a new swagger became evident\r\nin his bearing, in the way he sat his horse; half-forgotten oaths rose\r\nnaturally to his lips, and as he rode he hummed old songs that he had\r\nroared in chorus with his reckless companions in many a tavern and on\r\nmany a dusty road or bloody field.\r\n\r\nIt was an unquiet land through which he rode. The companies of cavalry\r\nwhich usually patrolled the river, alert for raids out of Poitain, were\r\nnowhere in evidence. Internal strife had left the borders unguarded. The\r\nlong white road stretched bare from horizon to horizon. No laden camel\r\ntrains or rumbling wagons or lowing herds moved along it now; only\r\noccasional groups of horsemen in leather and steel, hawk-faced,\r\nhard-eyed men, who kept together and rode warily. These swept Conan with\r\ntheir searching gaze but rode on, for the solitary rider's harness\r\npromised no plunder, but only hard strokes.\r\n\r\nVillages lay in ashes and deserted, the fields and meadows idle. Only\r\nthe boldest would ride the roads these days, and the native population\r\nhad been decimated in the civil wars, and by raids from across the\r\nriver. In more peaceful times the road was thronged with merchants\r\nriding Poitain to Messantia in Argos, or back. But now these found it\r\nwiser to follow the road that led east through Poitain, and then turned\r\nsouth down across Argos. It was longer, but safer. Only an extremely\r\nreckless man would risk his life and goods on this road through Zingara.\r\n\r\nThe southern horizon was fringed with flame by night, and in the day\r\nstraggling pillars of smoke drifted upward; in the cities and plains to\r\nthe south men were dying, thrones were toppling and castles going up in\r\nflames. Conan felt the old tug of the professional fighting-man, to turn\r\nhis horse and plunge into the fighting, the pillaging and the looting as\r\nin the days of old. Why should he toil to regain the rule of a people\r\nwhich had already forgotten him?--why chase a will-o'-the-wisp, why\r\npursue a crown that was lost for ever? Why should he not seek\r\nforgetfulness, lose himself in the red tides of war and rapine that had\r\nengulfed him so often before? Could he not, indeed, carve out another\r\nkingdom for himself? The world was entering an age of iron, an age of\r\nwar and imperialistic ambition; some strong man might well rise above\r\nthe ruins of nations as a supreme conqueror. Why should it not be\r\nhimself? So his familiar devil whispered in his ear, and the phantoms of\r\nhis lawless and bloody past crowded upon him. But he did not turn aside;\r\nhe rode onward, following a quest that grew dimmer and dimmer as he\r\nadvanced, until sometimes it seemed that he pursued a dream that never\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nHe pushed the black stallion as hard as he dared, but the long white\r\nroad lay bare before him, from horizon to horizon. It was a long start\r\nZorathus had, but Conan rode steadily on, knowing that he was traveling\r\nfaster than the burdened merchants could travel. And so he came to the\r\ncastle of Count Valbroso, perched like a vulture's eyrie on a bare hill\r\noverlooking the road.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nValbroso rode down with his men-at-arms, a lean, dark man with\r\nglittering eyes and a predatory beak of a nose. He wore black\r\nplate-armor and was followed by thirty spearmen, black-mustached hawks\r\nof the border wars, as avaricious and ruthless as himself. Of late the\r\ntoll of the caravans had been slim, and Valbroso cursed the civil wars\r\nthat stripped the roads of their fat traffic, even while he blessed them\r\nfor the free hand they allowed him with his neighbors.\r\n\r\nHe had not hoped much from the solitary rider he had glimpsed from his\r\ntower, but all was grist that came to his mill. With a practised eye he\r\ntook in Conan's worn mail and dark, scarred face, and his conclusions\r\nwere the same as those of the riders who had passed the Cimmerian on the\r\nroad--an empty purse and a ready blade.\r\n\r\n'Who are you, knave?' he demanded.\r\n\r\n'A mercenary, riding for Argos,' answered Conan. 'What matter names?'\r\n\r\n'You are riding in the wrong direction for a Free Companion,' grunted\r\nValbroso. 'Southward the fighting is good and also the plundering. Join\r\nmy company. You won't go hungry. The road remains bare of fat merchants\r\nto strip, but I mean to take my rogues and fare southward to sell our\r\nswords to whichever side seems strongest.'\r\n\r\nConan did not at once reply, knowing that if he refused outright, he\r\nmight be instantly attacked by Valbroso's men-at-arms. Before he could\r\nmake up his mind, the Zingaran spoke again:\r\n\r\n'You rogues of the Free Companies always know tricks to make men talk. I\r\nhave a prisoner--the last merchant I caught, by Mitra, and the only one\r\nI've seen for a week--and the knave is stubborn. He has an iron box,\r\nthe secret of which defies us, and I've been unable to persuade him to\r\nopen it. By Ishtar, I thought I knew all the modes of persuasion there\r\nare, but perhaps you, as a veteran Free Companion, know some that I do\r\nnot. At any rate come with me and see what you may do.'\r\n\r\nValbroso's words instantly decided Conan. That sounded a great deal like\r\nZorathus. Conan did not know the merchant, but any man who was stubborn\r\nenough to try to traverse the Zingaran road in times like these would\r\nvery probably be stubborn enough to defy torture.\r\n\r\nHe fell in beside Valbroso and rode up the straggling road to the top of\r\nthe hill where the gaunt castle stood. As a man-at-arms he should have\r\nridden behind the count, but force of habit made him careless and\r\nValbroso paid no heed. Years of life on the border had taught the count\r\nthat the frontier is not the royal court. He was aware of the\r\nindependence of the mercenaries, behind whose swords many a king had\r\ntrodden the throne-path.\r\n\r\nThere was a dry moat, half filled with debris in some places. They\r\nclattered across the drawbridge and through the arch of the gate. Behind\r\nthem the portcullis fell with a sullen clang. They came into a bare\r\ncourtyard, grown with straggling grass, and with a well in the middle.\r\nShacks for the men-at-arms straggled about the bailey wall, and women,\r\nslatternly or decked in gaudy finery, looked from the doors.\r\nFighting-men in rusty mail tossed dice on the flags under the arches. It\r\nwas more like a bandit's hold than the castle of a nobleman.\r\n\r\nValbroso dismounted and motioned Conan to follow him. They went\r\nthrough a doorway and along a vaulted corridor, where they were\r\nmet by a scarred, hard-looking man in mail descending a stone\r\nstaircase--evidently the captain of the guard.\r\n\r\n'How, Beloso,' quoth Valbroso; 'has he spoken?'\r\n\r\n'He is stubborn,' muttered Beloso, shooting a glance of suspicion at\r\nConan.\r\n\r\nValbroso ripped out an oath and stamped furiously up the winding stair,\r\nfollowed by Conan and the captain. As they mounted, the groans of a man\r\nin mortal agony became audible. Valbroso's torture-room was high above\r\nthe court, instead of in a dungeon below. In that chamber, where a\r\ngaunt, hairy beast of a man in leather breeks squatted gnawing a\r\nbeef-bone voraciously, stood the machines of torture--racks, boots,\r\nhooks and all the implements that the human mind devises to tear flesh,\r\nbreak bones and rend and rupture veins and ligaments.\r\n\r\nOn a rack a man was stretched naked, and a glance told Conan that he was\r\ndying. The unnatural elongation of his limbs and body told of unhinged\r\njoints and unnamable ruptures. He was a dark man, with an intelligent,\r\naquiline face and quick dark eyes. They were glazed and bloodshot now\r\nwith pain, and the dew of agony glistened on his face. His lips were\r\ndrawn back from blackened gums.\r\n\r\n'There is the box.' Viciously Valbroso kicked a small but heavy iron\r\nchest that stood on the floor near by. It was intricately carved, with\r\ntiny skulls and writhing dragons curiously intertwined, but Conan saw no\r\ncatch or hasp that might serve to unlock the lid. The marks of fire, of\r\nax and sledge and chisel showed on it but as scratches.\r\n\r\n'This is the dog's treasure box,' said Valbroso angrily. 'All men of the\r\nsouth know of Zorathus and his iron chest. Mitra knows what is in it.\r\nBut he will not give up its secret.'\r\n\r\nZorathus! It was true, then; the man he sought lay before him. Conan's\r\nheart beat suffocatingly as he leaned over the writhing form, though he\r\nexhibited no evidence of his painful eagerness.\r\n\r\n'Ease those ropes, knave!' he ordered the torturer harshly, and Valbroso\r\nand his captain stared. In the forgetfulness of the moment Conan had\r\nused his imperial tone, and the brute in leather instinctively obeyed\r\nthe knife-edge of command in that voice. He eased away gradually, for\r\nelse the slackening of the ropes had been as great a torment to the torn\r\njoints as further stretching.\r\n\r\nCatching up a vessel of wine that stood near by, Conan placed the rim to\r\nthe wretch's lips. Zorathus gulped spasmodically, the liquid slopping\r\nover on his heaving breast.\r\n\r\nInto the bloodshot eyes came a gleam of recognition, and the\r\nfroth-smeared lips parted. From them issued a racking whimper in the\r\nKothic tongue.\r\n\r\n'Is this death, then? Is the long agony ended? For this is King Conan\r\nwho died at Valkia, and I am among the dead.'\r\n\r\n'You're not dead,' said Conan. 'But you're dying. You'll be tortured no\r\nmore. I'll see to that. But I can't help you further. Yet before you\r\ndie, tell me how to open your iron box!'\r\n\r\n'My iron box,' mumbled Zorathus in delirious disjointed phrases. 'The\r\nchest forged in unholy fires among the flaming mountains of Khrosha; the\r\nmetal no chisel can cut. How many treasures has it borne, across the\r\nwidth and the breadth of the world! But no such treasure as it now\r\nholds.'\r\n\r\n'Tell me how to open it,' urged Conan. 'It can do you no good, and it\r\nmay aid me.'\r\n\r\n'Aye, you are Conan,' muttered the Kothian. 'I have seen you sitting on\r\nyour throne in the great public hall of Tarantia, with your crown on\r\nyour head and the scepter in your hand. But you are dead; you died at\r\nValkia. And so I know my own end is at hand.'\r\n\r\n'What does the dog say?' demanded Valbroso impatiently, not\r\nunderstanding Kothic. 'Will he tell us how to open the box?'\r\n\r\nAs if the voice roused a spark of life in the twisted breast Zorathus\r\nrolled his bloodshot eyes toward the speaker.\r\n\r\n'Only Valbroso will I tell,' he gasped in Zingaran. 'Death is upon me.\r\nLean close to me, Valbroso!'\r\n\r\nThe count did so, his dark face lit with avarice; behind him his\r\nsaturnine captain, Beloso, crowded closer.\r\n\r\n'Press the seven skulls on the rim, one after another,' gasped Zorathus.\r\n'Press then the head of the dragon that writhes across the lid. Then\r\npress the sphere in the dragon's claws. That will release the secret\r\ncatch.'\r\n\r\n'Quick, the box!' cried Valbroso with an oath.\r\n\r\nConan lifted it and set it on a dais, and Valbroso shouldered him aside.\r\n\r\n'Let me open it!' cried Beloso, starting forward.\r\n\r\nValbroso cursed him back, his greed blazing in his black eyes.\r\n\r\n'None but me shall open it!' he cried.\r\n\r\nConan, whose hand had instinctively gone to his hilt, glanced at\r\nZorathus. The man's eyes were glazed and bloodshot, but they were fixed\r\non Valbroso with burning intensity; and was there the shadow of a grim\r\ntwisted smile on the dying man's lips? Not until the merchant knew he\r\nwas dying had he given up the secret. Conan turned to watch Valbroso,\r\neven as the dying man watched him.\r\n\r\nAlong the rim of the lid seven skulls were carved among intertwining\r\nbranches of strange trees. An inlaid dragon writhed its way across the\r\ntop of the lid amid ornate arabesques. Valbroso pressed the skulls in\r\nfumbling haste, and as he jammed his thumb down on the carved head of\r\nthe dragon he swore sharply and snatched his hand away, shaking it in\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n'A sharp point on the carvings,' he snarled. 'I've pricked my thumb.'\r\n\r\nHe pressed the gold ball clutched in the dragon's talons, and the lid\r\nflew abruptly open. Their eyes were dazzled by a golden flame. It seemed\r\nto their dazed minds that the carven box was full of glowing fire that\r\nspilled over the rim and dripped through the air in quivering flakes.\r\nBeloso cried out and Valbroso sucked in his breath. Conan stood\r\nspeechless, his brain snared by the blaze.\r\n\r\n'Mitra, what a jewel!' Valbroso's hand dived into the chest, came out\r\nwith a great pulsing crimson sphere that filled the room with a lambent\r\nglow. In its glare Valbroso looked like a corpse. And the dying man on\r\nthe loosened rack laughed wildly and suddenly.\r\n\r\n'Fool!' he screamed. 'The jewel is yours! I give you death with it! The\r\nscratch on your thumb--look at the dragon's head, Valbroso!'\r\n\r\nThey all wheeled, stared. Something tiny and dully gleaming stood up\r\nfrom the gaping, carved mouth.\r\n\r\n'The dragon's fang!' shrieked Zorathus. 'Steeped in the venom of the\r\nblack Stygian scorpion! Fool, fool to open the box of Zorathus with your\r\nnaked hand! Death! You are a dead man now!'\r\n\r\nAnd with bloody foam on his lips he died.\r\n\r\nValbroso staggered, crying out. 'Ah, Mitra, I burn!' he shrieked. 'My\r\nveins race with liquid fire! My joints are bursting asunder! Death!\r\nDeath!' And he reeled and crashed headlong. There was an instant of\r\nawful convulsions, in which the limbs were twisted into hideous and\r\nunnatural positions, and then in that posture the man froze, his glassy\r\neyes staring sightlessly upward, his lips drawn back from blackened\r\ngums.\r\n\r\n'Dead!' muttered Conan, stooping to pick up the jewel where it rolled on\r\nthe floor from Valbroso's rigid hand. It lay on the floor like a\r\nquivering pool of sunset fire.\r\n\r\n'Dead!' muttered Beloso, with madness in his eyes. And then he moved.\r\n\r\nConan was caught off guard, his eyes dazzled, his brain dazed by the\r\nblaze of the great gem. He did not realize Beloso's intention until\r\nsomething crashed with terrible force upon his helmet. The glow of the\r\njewel was splashed with redder flame, and he went to his knees under the\r\nblow.\r\n\r\nHe heard a rush of feet, a bellow of ox-like agony. He was stunned but\r\nnot wholly senseless, and realized that Beloso had caught up the iron\r\nbox and crashed it down on his head as he stooped. Only his basinet had\r\nsaved his skull. He staggered up, drawing his sword, trying to shake the\r\ndimness out of his eyes. The room swam to his dizzy gaze. But the door\r\nwas open and fleet footsteps were dwindling down the winding stair. On\r\nthe floor the brutish torturer was gasping out his life with a great\r\ngash under his breast. And the Heart of Ahriman was gone.\r\n\r\nConan reeled out of the chamber, sword in hand, blood streaming down his\r\nface from under his burganet. He ran drunkenly down the steps, hearing a\r\nclang of steel in the courtyard below, shouts, then the frantic drum of\r\nhoofs. Rushing into the bailey he saw the men-at-arms milling about\r\nconfusedly, while women screeched. The postern gate stood open and a\r\nsoldier lay across his pike with his head split. Horses, still bridled\r\nand saddled, ran neighing about the court, Conan's black stallion among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n'He's mad!' howled a woman, wringing her hands as she rushed brainlessly\r\nabout. 'He came out of the castle like a mad dog, hewing right and left!\r\nBeloso's mad! Where's Lord Valbroso?'\r\n\r\n'Which way did he go?' roared Conan.\r\n\r\nAll turned and stared at the stranger's blood-stained face and naked\r\nsword.\r\n\r\n'Through the postern!' shrilled a woman, pointing eastward, and another\r\nbawled: 'Who is this rogue?'\r\n\r\n'Beloso has killed Valbroso!' yelled Conan, leaping and seizing the\r\nstallion's mane, as the men-at-arms advanced uncertainly on him. A wild\r\noutcry burst forth at his news, but their reaction was exactly as he had\r\nanticipated. Instead of closing the gates to take him prisoner, or\r\npursuing the fleeing slayer to avenge their lord, they were thrown into\r\neven greater confusion by his words. Wolves bound together only by fear\r\nof Valbroso, they owed no allegiance to the castle or to each other.\r\n\r\nSwords began to clash in the courtyard, and women screamed. And in the\r\nmidst of it all, none noticed Conan as he shot through the postern gate\r\nand thundered down the hill. The wide plain spread before him, and\r\nbeyond the hill the caravan road divided: one branch ran south, the\r\nother east. And on the eastern road he saw another rider, bending low\r\nand spurring hard. The plain swam to Conan's gaze, the sunlight was a\r\nthick red haze and he reeled in his saddle, grasping the flowing mane\r\nwith his hand. Blood rained on his mail, but grimly he urged the\r\nstallion on.\r\n\r\nBehind him smoke began to pour out of the castle on the hill where the\r\ncount's body lay forgotten and unheeded beside that of his prisoner. The\r\nsun was setting; against a lurid red sky the two black figures fled.\r\n\r\nThe stallion was not fresh, but neither was the horse ridden by Beloso.\r\nBut the great beast responded mightily, calling on deep reservoirs of\r\nreserve vitality. Why the Zingaran fled from one pursuer Conan did not\r\ntax his bruised brain to guess. Perhaps unreasoning panic rode Beloso,\r\nborn of the madness that lurked in that blazing jewel. The sun was gone;\r\nthe white road was a dim glimmer through a ghostly twilight fading into\r\npurple gloom far ahead of him.\r\n\r\nThe stallion panted, laboring hard. The country was changing, in the\r\ngathering dusk. Bare plains gave way to clumps of oaks and alders. Low\r\nhills mounted up in the distance. Stars began to blink out. The stallion\r\ngasped and reeled in his course. But ahead rose a dense wood that\r\nstretched to the hills on the horizon, and between it and himself Conan\r\nglimpsed the dim form of the fugitive. He urged on the distressed\r\nstallion, for he saw that he was overtaking his prey, yard by yard.\r\nAbove the pound of the hoofs a strange cry rose from the shadows, but\r\nneither pursuer nor pursued gave heed.\r\n\r\nAs they swept in under the branches that overhung the road, they were\r\nalmost side by side. A fierce cry rose from Conan's lips as his sword\r\nwent up; a pale oval of a face was turned toward him, a sword gleamed\r\nin a half-seen hand, and Beloso echoed the cry--and then the weary\r\nstallion, with a lurch and a groan, missed his footing in the shadows\r\nand went heels over head, hurling his dazed rider from the saddle.\r\nConan's throbbing head crashed against a stone, and the stars were\r\nblotted out in a thicker night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow long Conan lay senseless he never knew. His first sensation of\r\nreturning consciousness was that of being dragged by one arm over rough\r\nand stony ground and through dense underbrush. Then he was thrown\r\ncarelessly down, and perhaps the jolt brought back his senses.\r\n\r\nHis helmet was gone, his head ached abominably, he felt a qualm of\r\nnausea, and blood was clotted thickly among his black locks. But with\r\nthe vitality of a wild thing life and consciousness surged back into\r\nhim, and he became aware of his surroundings.\r\n\r\nA broad red moon was shining through the trees, by which he knew that it\r\nwas long after midnight. He had lain senseless for hours, long enough to\r\nhave recovered from that terrible blow Beloso had dealt him, as well as\r\nthe fall which had rendered him senseless. His brain felt clearer than\r\nit had felt during that mad ride after the fugitive.\r\n\r\nHe was not lying beside the white road, he noticed with a start of\r\nsurprise, as his surroundings began to record themselves on his\r\nperceptions. The road was nowhere in sight. He lay on the grassy earth,\r\nin a small glade hemmed in by a black wall of tree stems and tangled\r\nbranches. His face and hands were scratched and lacerated as if he had\r\nbeen dragged through brambles. Shifting his body he looked about him.\r\nAnd then he started violently--something was squatting over him....\r\n\r\nAt first Conan doubted his consciousness, thought it was but a figment\r\nof delirium. Surely it could not be real, that strange, motionless gray\r\nbeing that squatted on its haunches and stared down at him with\r\nunblinking soulless eyes.\r\n\r\nConan lay and stared, half expecting it to vanish like a figure of a\r\ndream, and then a chill of recollection crept along his spine.\r\nHalf-forgotten memories surged back, of grisly tales whispered of the\r\nshapes that haunted these uninhabited forests at the foot of the hills\r\nthat mark the Zingaran-Argossean border. Ghouls, men called them, eaters\r\nof human flesh, spawn of darkness, children of unholy matings of a lost\r\nand forgotten race with the demons of the underworld. Somewhere in these\r\nprimitive forests were the ruins of an ancient, accursed city, men\r\nwhispered, and among its tombs slunk gray, anthropomorphic\r\nshadows--Conan shuddered strongly.\r\n\r\nHe lay staring at the malformed head that rose dimly above him, and\r\ncautiously he extended a hand toward the sword at his hip. With a\r\nhorrible cry that the man involuntarily echoed, the monster was at his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nConan threw up his right arm, and the dog-like jaws closed on it,\r\ndriving the mail links into the hard flesh. The misshapen yet man-like\r\nhands clutched for his throat, but he evaded them with a heave and roll\r\nof his whole body, at the same time drawing his dagger with his left\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThey tumbled over and over on the grass, smiting and tearing. The\r\nmuscles coiling under that gray corpse-like skin were stringy and hard\r\nas steel wires, exceeding the strength of a man. But Conan's thews were\r\niron too, and his mail saved him from the gnashing fangs and ripping\r\nclaws long enough for him to drive home his dagger, again and again and\r\nagain. The horrible vitality of the semi-human monstrosity seemed\r\ninexhaustible, and the king's skin crawled at the feel of that slick,\r\nclammy flesh. He put all his loathing and savage revulsion behind the\r\nplunging blade, and suddenly the monster heaved up convulsively beneath\r\nhim as the point found its grisly heart, and then lay still.\r\n\r\nConan rose, shaken with nausea. He stood in the center of the glade\r\nuncertainly, sword in one hand and dagger in the other. He had not lost\r\nhis instinctive sense of direction, as far as the points of the compass\r\nwere concerned, but he did not know in which direction the road lay. He\r\nhad no way of knowing in which direction the ghoul had dragged him.\r\nConan glared at the silent, black, moon-dappled woods which ringed him,\r\nand felt cold moisture bead his flesh. He was without a horse and lost\r\nin these haunted woods, and that staring deformed thing at his feet was\r\na mute evidence of the horrors that lurked in the forest. He stood\r\nalmost holding his breath in his painful intensity, straining his ears\r\nfor some crack of twig or rustle of grass.\r\n\r\nWhen a sound did come he started violently. Suddenly out on the night\r\nair broke the scream of a terrified horse. His stallion! There were\r\npanthers in the wood--or--ghouls ate beasts as well as men.\r\n\r\nHe broke savagely through the brush in the direction of the sound,\r\nwhistling shrilly as he ran, his fear drowned in berserk rage. If his\r\nhorse was killed, there went his last chance of following Beloso and\r\nrecovering the jewel. Again the stallion screamed with fear and fury,\r\nsomewhere nearer. There was a sound of lashing heels, and something that\r\nwas struck heavily and gave way.\r\n\r\nConan burst out into the wide white road without warning, and saw the\r\nstallion plunging and rearing in the moonlight, his ears laid back, his\r\neyes and teeth flashing wickedly. He lashed out with his heels at a\r\nslinking shadow that ducked and bobbed about him--and then about Conan\r\nother shadows moved: gray, furtive shadows that closed in on all sides.\r\nA hideous charnel-house scent reeked up in the night air.\r\n\r\nWith a curse the king hewed right and left with his broadsword, thrust\r\nand ripped with his dagger. Dripping fangs flashed in the moonlight,\r\nfoul paws caught at him, but he hacked his way through to the stallion,\r\ncaught the rein, leaped into the saddle. His sword rose and fell, a\r\nfrosty arc in the moonlight, showering blood as it split misshapen\r\nheads, clove shambling bodies. The stallion reared, biting and kicking.\r\nThey burst through and thundered down the road. On either hand, for a\r\nshort space, flitted gray abhorrent shadows. Then these fell behind, and\r\nConan, topping a wooded crest, saw a vast expanse of bare slopes\r\nsweeping up and away before him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n'A Ghost Out of the Past'\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after sunrise Conan crossed the Argossean border. Of Beloso he had\r\nseen no trace. Either the captain had made good his escape while the\r\nking lay senseless, or had fallen prey to the grim man-eaters of the\r\nZingaran forest. But Conan had seen no signs to indicate the latter\r\npossibility. The fact that he had lain unmolested for so long seemed to\r\nindicate that the monsters had been engrossed in futile pursuit of the\r\ncaptain. And if the man lived, Conan felt certain that he was riding\r\nalong the road somewhere ahead of him. Unless he had intended going into\r\nArgos he would never have taken the eastward road in the first place.\r\n\r\nThe helmeted guards at the frontier did not question the Cimmerian. A\r\nsingle wandering mercenary required no passport nor safe-conduct,\r\nespecially when his unadorned mail showed him to be in the service of no\r\nlord. Through the low, grassy hills where streams murmured and oak\r\ngroves dappled the sward with lights and shadows he rode, following the\r\nlong road that rose and fell away ahead of him over dales and rises in\r\nthe blue distance. It was an old, old road, this highway from Poitain to\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nArgos was at peace; laden ox-wains rumbled along the road, and men with\r\nbare, brown, brawny arms toiled in orchards and fields that smiled away\r\nunder the branches of the roadside trees. Old men on settles before inns\r\nunder spreading oak branches called greetings to the wayfarer.\r\n\r\nFrom the men that worked the fields, from the garrulous old men in the\r\ninns where he slaked his thirst with great leathern jacks of foaming\r\nale, from the sharp-eyed silk-clad merchants he met upon the road, Conan\r\nsought for news of Beloso.\r\n\r\nStories were conflicting, but this much Conan learned: that a lean, wiry\r\nZingaran with the dangerous black eyes and mustaches of the western folk\r\nwas somewhere on the road ahead of him, and apparently making for\r\nMessantia. It was a logical destination; all the sea-ports of Argos were\r\ncosmopolitan, in strong contrast with the inland provinces, and\r\nMessantia was the most polyglot of all. Craft of all the maritime\r\nnations rode in its harbor, and refugees and fugitives from many lands\r\ngathered there. Laws were lax; for Messantia thrived on the trade of the\r\nsea, and her citizens found it profitable to be somewhat blind on their\r\ndealings with seamen. It was not only legitimate trade that flowed into\r\nMessantia; smugglers and buccaneers played their part. All this Conan\r\nknew well, for had he not, in the days of old when he was a Barachan\r\npirate, sailed by night into the harbor of Messantia to discharge\r\nstrange cargoes? Most of the pirates of the Barachan Isles--small\r\nislands off the southwestern coast of Zingara--were Argossean sailors,\r\nand as long as they confined their attentions to the shipping of other\r\nnations, the authorities of Argos were not too strict in their\r\ninterpretation of sea-laws.\r\n\r\nBut Conan had not limited his activities to those of the Barachans. He\r\nhad also sailed with the Zingaran buccaneers, and even with those wild\r\nblack corsairs that swept up from the far south to harry the northern\r\ncoasts, and this put him beyond the pale of any law. If he were\r\nrecognized in any of the ports of Argos it would cost him his head. But\r\nwithout hesitation he rode on to Messantia, halting day or night only to\r\nrest the stallion and to snatch a few winks of sleep for himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe entered the city unquestioned, merging himself with the throngs that\r\npoured continually in and out of this great commercial center. No walls\r\nsurrounded Messantia. The sea and the ships of the sea guarded the great\r\nsouthern trading city.\r\n\r\nIt was evening when Conan rode leisurely through the streets that\r\nmarched down to the waterfront. At the ends of these streets he saw the\r\nwharves and the masts and sails of ships. He smelled salt water for the\r\nfirst time in years, heard the thrum of cordage and the creak of spars\r\nin the breeze that was kicking up whitecaps out beyond the headlands.\r\nAgain the urge of far wandering tugged at his heart.\r\n\r\nBut he did not go on to the wharves. He reined aside and rode up a steep\r\nflight of wide, worn stone steps, to a broad street where ornate white\r\nmansions overlooked the waterfront and the harbor below. Here dwelt the\r\nmen who had grown rich from the hard-won fat of the seas--a few old\r\nsea-captains who had found treasure afar, many traders and merchants who\r\nnever trod the naked decks nor knew the roar of tempest or sea-fight.\r\n\r\nConan turned in his horse at a certain gold-worked gate, and rode into a\r\ncourt where a fountain tinkled and pigeons fluttered from marble coping\r\nto marble flagging. A page in jagged silken jupon and hose came forward\r\ninquiringly. The merchants of Messantia dealt with many strange and\r\nrough characters but most of these smacked of the sea. It was strange\r\nthat a mercenary trooper should so freely ride into the court of a lord\r\nof commerce.\r\n\r\n'The merchant Publio dwells here?' It was more statement than question,\r\nand something in the timbre of the voice caused the page to doff his\r\nfeather chaperon as he bowed and replied: 'Aye, so he does, my captain.'\r\n\r\nConan dismounted and the page called a servitor, who came running to\r\nreceive the stallion's rein.\r\n\r\n'Your master is within?' Conan drew off his gauntlets and slapped the\r\ndust of the road from cloak and mail.\r\n\r\n'Aye, my captain. Whom shall I announce?'\r\n\r\n'I'll announce myself,' grunted Conan. 'I know the way well enough. Bide\r\nyou here.'\r\n\r\nAnd obeying that peremptory command the page stood still, staring after\r\nConan as the latter climbed a short flight of marble steps, and\r\nwondering what connection his master might have with this giant\r\nfighting-man who had the aspect of a northern barbarian.\r\n\r\nMenials at their tasks halted and gaped open-mouthed as Conan crossed a\r\nwide, cool balcony overlooking the court and entered a broad corridor\r\nthrough which the sea-breeze swept. Halfway down this he heard a quill\r\nscratching, and turned into a broad room whose many wide casements\r\noverlooked the harbor.\r\n\r\nPublio sat at a carved teakwood desk writing on rich parchment with a\r\ngolden quill. He was a short man, with a massive head and quick dark\r\neyes. His blue robe was of the finest watered silk, trimmed with\r\ncloth-of-gold, and from his thick white throat hung a heavy gold chain.\r\n\r\nAs the Cimmerian entered, the merchant looked up with a gesture of\r\nannoyance. He froze in the midst of his gesture. His mouth opened; he\r\nstared as at a ghost out of the past. Unbelief and fear glimmered in his\r\nwide eyes.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Conan, 'have you no word of greeting, Publio?'\r\n\r\nPublio moistened his lips.\r\n\r\n'Conan!' he whispered incredulously. 'Mitra! Conan! _Amra!_'\r\n\r\n'Who else?' The Cimmerian unclasped his cloak and threw it with his\r\ngauntlets down upon the desk. 'How man?' he exclaimed irritably. 'Can't\r\nyou at least offer me a beaker of wine? My throat's caked with the dust\r\nof the highway.'\r\n\r\n'Aye, wine!' echoed Publio mechanically. Instinctively his hand reached\r\nfor a gong, then recoiled as from a hot coal, and he shuddered.\r\n\r\nWhile Conan watched him with a flicker of grim amusement in his eyes,\r\nthe merchant rose and hurriedly shut the door, first craning his neck up\r\nand down the corridor to be sure that no slave was loitering about.\r\nThen, returning, he took a gold vessel of wine from a near-by table and\r\nwas about to fill a slender goblet when Conan impatiently took the\r\nvessel from him and lifting it with both hands, drank deep and with\r\ngusto.\r\n\r\n'Aye, it's Conan, right enough,' muttered Publio. 'Man, are you mad?'\r\n\r\n'By Crom, Publio,' said Conan, lowering the vessel but retaining it in\r\nhis hands, 'you dwell in different quarters than of old. It takes an\r\nArgossean merchant to wring wealth out of a little waterfront shop that\r\nstank of rotten fish and cheap wine.'\r\n\r\n'The old days are past,' muttered Publio, drawing his robe about him\r\nwith a slight involuntary shudder. 'I have put off the past like a\r\nworn-out cloak.'\r\n\r\n'Well,' retorted Conan, 'you can't put _me_ off like an old cloak. It\r\nisn't much I want of you, but that much I do want. And you can't refuse\r\nme. We had too many dealings in the old days. Am I such a fool that I'm\r\nnot aware that this fine mansion was built on my sweat and blood? How\r\nmany cargoes from my galleys passed through your shop?'\r\n\r\n'All merchants of Messantia have dealt with the sea-rovers at one time\r\nor another,' mumbled Publio nervously.\r\n\r\n'But not with the black corsairs,' answered Conan grimly.\r\n\r\n'For Mitra's sake, be silent!' ejaculated Publio, sweat starting out on\r\nhis brow. His fingers jerked at the gilt-worked edge of his robe.\r\n\r\n'Well, I only wished to recall it to your mind,' answered Conan. 'Don't\r\nbe so fearful. You took plenty of risks in the past, when you were\r\nstruggling for life and wealth in that lousy little shop down by the\r\nwharves, and were hand-and-glove with every buccaneer and smuggler and\r\npirate from here to the Barachan Isles. Prosperity must have softened\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n'I am respectable,' began Publio.\r\n\r\n'Meaning you're rich as hell,' snorted Conan. 'Why? Why did you grow\r\nwealthy so much quicker than your competitors? Was it because you did a\r\nbig business in ivory and ostrich feathers, copper and skins and pearls\r\nand hammered gold ornaments, and other things from the coast of Kush?\r\nAnd where did you get them so cheaply, while other merchants were paying\r\ntheir weight in silver to the Stygians for them? I'll tell you, in case\r\nyou've forgotten: you bought them from me, at considerably less than\r\ntheir value, and I took them from the tribes of the Black Coast, and\r\nfrom the ships of the Stygians--I, and the black corsairs.'\r\n\r\n'In Mitra's name, cease!' begged Publio. 'I have not forgotten. But what\r\nare you doing here? I am the only man in Argos who knew that the king of\r\nAquilonia was once Conan the buccaneer, in the old days. But word has\r\ncome southward of the overthrow of Aquilonia and the death of the king.'\r\n\r\n'My enemies have killed me a hundred times by rumors,' grunted Conan.\r\n'Yet here I sit and guzzle wine of Kyros.' And he suited the action to\r\nthe word.\r\n\r\nLowering the vessel, which was now nearly empty, he said: 'It's but a\r\nsmall thing I ask of you, Publio. I know that you're aware of everything\r\nthat goes on in Messantia. I want to know if a Zingaran named Beloso, or\r\nhe might call himself anything, is in this city. He's tall and lean and\r\ndark like all his race, and it's likely he'll seek to sell a very rare\r\njewel.'\r\n\r\nPublio shook his head.\r\n\r\n'I have not heard of such a man. But thousands come and go in Messantia.\r\nIf he is here my agents will discover him.'\r\n\r\n'Good. Send them to look for him. And in the meantime have my horse\r\ncared for, and have food served me here in this room.'\r\n\r\nPublio assented volubly, and Conan emptied the wine vessel, tossed it\r\ncarelessly into a corner, and strode to a near-by casement,\r\ninvoluntarily expanding his chest as he breathed deep of the salt air.\r\nHe was looking down upon the meandering waterfront streets. He swept the\r\nships in the harbor with an appreciative glance, then lifted his head\r\nand stared beyond the bay, far into the blue haze of the distance where\r\nsea met sky. And his memory sped beyond that horizon, to the golden seas\r\nof the south, under flaming suns, where laws were not and life ran\r\nhotly. Some vagrant scent of spice or palm woke clear-etched images of\r\nstrange coasts where mangroves grew and drums thundered, of ships locked\r\nin battle and decks running blood, of smoke and flame and the crying of\r\nslaughter.... Lost in his thoughts he scarcely noticed when Publio stole\r\nfrom the chamber.\r\n\r\nGathering up his robe, the merchant hurried along the corridors until he\r\ncame to a certain chamber where a tall, gaunt man with a scar upon his\r\ntemple wrote continually upon parchment. There was something about this\r\nman which made his clerkly occupation seem incongruous. To him Publio\r\nspoke abruptly:\r\n\r\n'Conan has returned!'\r\n\r\n'Conan?' The gaunt man started up and the quill fell from his fingers.\r\n'The corsair?'\r\n\r\n'Aye!'\r\n\r\nThe gaunt man went livid. 'Is he mad? If he is discovered here we are\r\nruined! They will hang a man who shelters or trades with a corsair as\r\nquickly as they'll hang the corsair himself! What if the governor should\r\nlearn of our past connections with him?'\r\n\r\n'He will not learn,' answered Publio grimly. 'Send your men into the\r\nmarkets and wharfside dives and learn if one Beloso, a Zingaran, is in\r\nMessantia. Conan said he had a gem, which he will probably seek to\r\ndispose of. The jewel merchants should know of him, if any do. And here\r\nis another task for you: pick up a dozen or so desperate villains who\r\ncan be trusted to do away with a man and hold their tongues afterward.\r\nYou understand me?'\r\n\r\n'I understand.' The other nodded slowly and somberly.\r\n\r\n'I have not stolen, cheated, lied and fought my way up from the gutter\r\nto be undone now by a ghost out of my past,' muttered Publio, and the\r\nsinister darkness of his countenance at that moment would have surprised\r\nthe wealthy nobles and ladies who bought their silks and pearls from his\r\nmany stalls. But when he returned to Conan a short time later, bearing\r\nin his own hands a platter of fruit and meats, he presented a placid\r\nface to his unwelcome guest.\r\n\r\nConan still stood at the casement, staring down into the harbor at the\r\npurple and crimson and vermilion and scarlet sails of galleons and\r\ncaracks and galleys and dromonds.\r\n\r\n'There's a Stygian galley, if I'm not blind,' he remarked, pointing to a\r\nlong, low, slim black ship lying apart from the others, anchored off the\r\nlow broad sandy beach that curved round to the distant headland. 'Is\r\nthere peace, then, between Stygia and Argos?'\r\n\r\n'The same sort that has existed before,' answered Publio, setting the\r\nplatter on the table with a sigh of relief, for it was heavily laden; he\r\nknew his guest of old. 'Stygian ports are temporarily open to our ships,\r\nas ours to theirs. But may no craft of mine meet their cursed galleys\r\nout of sight of land! That galley crept into the bay last night. What\r\nits masters wish I do not know. So far they have neither bought nor\r\nsold. I distrust those dark-skinned devils. Treachery had its birth in\r\nthat dusky land.'\r\n\r\n'I've made them howl,' said Conan carelessly, turning from the window.\r\n'In my galley manned by black corsairs I crept to the very bastions of\r\nthe sea-washed castles of black-walled Khemi by night, and burned the\r\ngalleons anchored there. And speaking of treachery, mine host, suppose\r\nyou taste these viands and sip a bit of this wine, just to show me that\r\nyour heart is on the right side.'\r\n\r\nPublio complied so readily that Conan's suspicions were lulled, and\r\nwithout further hesitation he sat down and devoured enough for three\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAnd while he ate, men moved through the markets and along the\r\nwaterfront, searching for a Zingaran who had a jewel to sell or who\r\nsought for a ship to carry him to foreign ports. And a tall gaunt man\r\nwith a scar on his temple sat with his elbows on a wine-stained table in\r\na squalid cellar with a brass lantern hanging from a smoke-blackened\r\nbeam overhead, and held converse with ten desperate rogues whose\r\nsinister countenances and ragged garments proclaimed their profession.\r\n\r\nAnd as the first stars blinked out, they shone on a strange band\r\nspurring their mounts along the white road that led to Messantia from\r\nthe west. They were four men, tall, gaunt, clad in black, hooded robes,\r\nand they did not speak. They forced their steeds mercilessly onward, and\r\nthose steeds were gaunt as themselves, and sweat-stained and weary as if\r\nfrom long travel and far wandering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\nThe Black Hand of Set\r\n\r\n\r\nConan woke from a sound sleep as quickly and instantly as a cat. And\r\nlike a cat he was on his feet with his sword out before the man who had\r\ntouched him could so much as draw back.\r\n\r\n'What word, Publio?' demanded Conan, recognizing his host. The gold lamp\r\nburned low, casting a mellow glow over the thick tapestries and the rich\r\ncoverings of the couch whereon he had been reposing.\r\n\r\nPublio, recovering from the start given him by the sudden action of his\r\nawakening guest, replied: 'The Zingaran has been located. He arrived\r\nyesterday, at dawn. Only a few hours ago he sought to sell a huge,\r\nstrange jewel to a Shemitish merchant, but the Shemite would have naught\r\nto do with it. Men say he turned pale beneath his black beard at the\r\nsight of it, and closing his stall, fled as from a thing accursed.'\r\n\r\n'It must be Beloso,' muttered Conan, feeling the pulse in his temples\r\npounding with impatient eagerness. 'Where is he now?'\r\n\r\n'He sleeps in the house of Servio.'\r\n\r\n'I know that dive of old,' grunted Conan. 'I'd better hasten before some\r\nof these waterfront thieves cut his throat for the jewel.'\r\n\r\nHe took up his cloak and flung it over his shoulders, then donned a\r\nhelmet Publio had procured for him.\r\n\r\n'Have my steed saddled and ready in the court,' said he. 'I may return\r\nin haste. I shall not forget this night's work, Publio.'\r\n\r\nA few moments later Publio, standing at a small outer door, watched the\r\nking's tall figure receding down the shadowy street.\r\n\r\n'Farewell to you, corsair,' muttered the merchant. 'This must be a\r\nnotable jewel, to be sought by a man who has just lost a kingdom. I\r\nwish I had told my knaves to let him secure it before they did their\r\nwork. But then, something might have gone awry. Let Argos forget Amra,\r\nand let my dealings with him be lost in the dust of the past. In the\r\nalley behind the house of Servio--that is where Conan will cease to be a\r\nperil to me.'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nServio's house, a dingy, ill-famed den, was located close to the\r\nwharves, facing the waterfront. It was a shambling building of stone and\r\nheavy ship-beams, and a long narrow alley wandered up alongside it.\r\nConan made his way along the alley, and as he approached the house he\r\nhad an uneasy feeling that he was being spied upon. He stared hard into\r\nthe shadows of the squalid buildings, but saw nothing, though once he\r\ncaught the faint rasp of cloth or leather against flesh. But that was\r\nnothing unusual. Thieves and beggars prowled these alleys all night, and\r\nthey were not likely to attack him, after one look at his size and\r\nharness.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly a door opened in the wall ahead of him, and he slipped into\r\nthe shadow of an arch. A figure emerged from the open door and moved\r\nalong the alley, not furtively, but with a natural noiselessness, like\r\nthat of a jungle beast. Enough starlight filtered into the alley to\r\nsilhouette the man's profile dimly as he passed the doorway where Conan\r\nlurked. The stranger was a Stygian. There was no mistaking that\r\nhawk-faced, shaven head, even in the starlight, nor the mantle over the\r\nbroad shoulders. He passed on down the alley in the direction of the\r\nbeach, and once Conan thought he must be carrying a lantern among his\r\ngarments, for he caught a flash of lambent light, just as the man\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nBut the Cimmerian forgot the stranger as he noticed that the door\r\nthrough which he had emerged still stood open. Conan had intended\r\nentering by the main entrance and forcing Servio to show him the room\r\nwhere the Zingaran slept. But if he could get into the house without\r\nattracting anyone's attention, so much the better.\r\n\r\nA few long strides brought him to the door, and as his hand fell on the\r\nlock he stifled an involuntary grunt. His practised fingers, skilled\r\namong the thieves of Zamora long ago, told him that the lock had been\r\nforced, apparently by some terrific pressure from the outside that had\r\ntwisted and bent the heavy iron bolts, tearing the very sockets loose\r\nfrom the jambs. How such damage could have been wrought so violently\r\nwithout awakening everyone in the neighborhood Conan could not imagine,\r\nbut he felt sure that it had been done that night. A broken lock, if\r\ndiscovered, would not go unmended in the house of Servio, in this\r\nneighborhood of thieves and cutthroats.\r\n\r\nConan entered stealthily, poniard in hand, wondering how he was to find\r\nthe chamber of the Zingaran. Groping in total darkness he halted\r\nsuddenly. He sensed death in that room, as a wild beast senses it--not\r\nas peril threatening him, but a dead thing, something freshly slain. In\r\nthe darkness his foot hit and recoiled from something heavy and\r\nyielding. With a sudden premonition he groped along the wall until he\r\nfound the shelf that supported the brass lamp, with its flint, steel and\r\ntinder beside it. A few seconds later a flickering, uncertain light\r\nsprang up, and he stared narrowly about him.\r\n\r\nA bunk built against the rough stone wall, a bare table and a bench\r\ncompleted the furnishings of the squalid chamber. An inner door stood\r\nclosed and bolted. And on the hard-beaten dirt floor lay Beloso. On his\r\nback he lay, with his head drawn back between his shoulders so that he\r\nseemed to stare with his wide glassy eyes at the sooty beams of the\r\ncobwebbed ceiling. His lips were drawn back from his teeth in a frozen\r\ngrin of agony. His sword lay near him, still in its scabbard. His shirt\r\nwas torn open, and on his brown, muscular breast was the print of a\r\nblack hand, thumb and four fingers plainly distinct.\r\n\r\nConan glared in silence, feeling the short hairs bristle at the back of\r\nhis neck.\r\n\r\n'Crom!' he muttered. 'The black hand of Set!'\r\n\r\nHe had seen that mark of old, the death-mark of the black priests of\r\nSet, the grim cult that ruled in dark Stygia. And suddenly he remembered\r\nthat curious flash he had seen emanating from the mysterious Stygian who\r\nhad emerged from this chamber.\r\n\r\n'The Heart, by Crom!' he muttered. 'He was carrying it under his mantle.\r\nHe stole it. He burst that door by his magic, and slew Beloso. He was a\r\npriest of Set.'\r\n\r\nA quick investigation confirmed at least part of his suspicions. The\r\njewel was not on the Zingaran's body. An uneasy feeling rose in Conan\r\nthat this had not happened by chance, or without design; a conviction\r\nthat the mysterious Stygian galley had come into the harbor of Messantia\r\non a definite mission. How could the priests of Set know that the Heart\r\nhad come southward? Yet the thought was no more fantastic than the\r\nnecromancy that could slay an armed man by the touch of an open, empty\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nA stealthy footfall outside the door brought him round like a great cat.\r\nWith one motion he extinguished the lamp and drew his sword. His ears\r\ntold him that men were out there in the darkness, were closing in on the\r\ndoorway. As his eyes became accustomed to the sudden darkness, he could\r\nmake out dim figures ringing the entrance. He could not guess their\r\nidentity, but as always he took the initiative--leaping suddenly forth\r\nfrom the doorway without awaiting the attack.\r\n\r\nHis unexpected movement took the skulkers by surprise. He sensed and\r\nheard men close about him, saw a dim masked figure in the starlight\r\nbefore him; then his sword crunched home, and he was fleeting away down\r\nthe alley before the slower-thinking and slower-acting attackers could\r\nintercept him.\r\n\r\nAs he ran he heard, somewhere ahead of him, a faint creak of oar-locks,\r\nand he forgot the men behind him. A boat was moving out into the bay!\r\nGritting his teeth he increased his speed, but before he reached the\r\nbeach he heard the rasp and creak of ropes, and the grind of the great\r\nsweep in its socket.\r\n\r\nThick clouds, rolling up from the sea, obscured the stars. In thick\r\ndarkness Conan came upon the strand, straining his eyes out across the\r\nblack restless water. Something was moving out there--a long, low, black\r\nshape that receded in the darkness, gathering momentum as it went. To\r\nhis ears came the rhythmical clack of long oars. He ground his teeth in\r\nhelpless fury. It was the Stygian galley and she was racing out to sea,\r\nbearing with her the jewel that meant to him the throne of Aquilonia.\r\n\r\nWith a savage curse he took a step toward the waves that lapped against\r\nthe sands, catching at his hauberk and intending to rip it off and swim\r\nafter the vanishing ship. Then the crunch of a heel in the sand brought\r\nhim about. He had forgotten his pursuers.\r\n\r\nDark figures closed in on him with a rush of feet through the sands. The\r\nfirst went down beneath the Cimmerian's flailing sword, but the others\r\ndid not falter. Blades whickered dimly about him in the darkness or\r\nrasped on his mail. Blood and entrails spilled over his hand and someone\r\nscreamed as he ripped murderously upward. A muttered voice spurred on\r\nthe attack, and that voice sounded vaguely familiar. Conan plowed\r\nthrough the clinging, hacking shapes toward the voice. A faint light\r\ngleaming momentarily through the drifting clouds showed him a tall gaunt\r\nman with a great livid scar on his temple. Conan's sword sheared through\r\nhis skull as through a ripe melon.\r\n\r\nThen an ax, swung blindly in the dark, crashed on the king's basinet,\r\nfilling his eyes with sparks of fire. He lurched and lunged, felt his\r\nsword sink deep and heard a shriek of agony. Then he stumbled over a\r\ncorpse, and a bludgeon knocked the dented helmet from his head; the next\r\ninstant the club fell full on his unprotected skull.\r\n\r\nThe king of Aquilonia crumpled into the wet sands. Over him wolfish\r\nfigures panted in the gloom.\r\n\r\n'Strike off his head,' muttered one.\r\n\r\n'Let him lie,' grunted another. 'Help me tie up my wounds before I bleed\r\nto death. The tide will wash him into the bay. See, he fell at the\r\nwater's edge. His skull's split; no man could live after such blows.'\r\n\r\n'Help me strip him,' urged another. 'His harness will fetch a few\r\npieces of silver. And haste. Tiberio is dead, and I hear seamen singing\r\nas they reel along the strand. Let us be gone.'\r\n\r\nThere followed hurried activity in the darkness, and then the sound of\r\nquickly receding footsteps. The tipsy singing of the seamen grew louder.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn his chamber Publio, nervously pacing back and forth before a window\r\nthat overlooked the shadowed bay, whirled suddenly, his nerves tingling.\r\nTo the best of his knowledge the door had been bolted from within; but\r\nnow it stood open and four men filed into the chamber. At the sight of\r\nthem his flesh crawled. Many strange beings Publio had seen in his\r\nlifetime, but none before like these. They were tall and gaunt,\r\nblack-robed, and their faces were dim yellow ovals in the shadows of\r\ntheir coifs. He could not tell much about their features and was\r\nunreasoningly glad that he could not. Each bore a long, curiously\r\nmottled staff.\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' he demanded, and his voice sounded brittle and hollow.\r\n'What do you wish here?'\r\n\r\n'Where is Conan, he who was king of Aquilonia?' demanded the tallest of\r\nthe four in a passionless monotone that made Publio shudder. It was like\r\nthe hollow tone of a Khitan temple bell.\r\n\r\n'I do not know what you mean,' stammered the merchant, his customary\r\npoise shaken by the uncanny aspect of his visitors. 'I know no such\r\nman.'\r\n\r\n'He has been here,' returned the other with no change of inflection.\r\n'His horse is in the courtyard. Tell us where he is before we do you an\r\ninjury.'\r\n\r\n'Gebal!' shouted Publio frantically, recoiling until he crouched against\r\nthe wall. '_Gebal!_'\r\n\r\nThe four Khitans watched him without emotion or change of expression.\r\n\r\n'If you summon your slave he will die,' warned one of them, which only\r\nserved to terrify Publio more than ever.\r\n\r\n'Gebal!' he screamed. 'Where are you, curse you? Thieves are murdering\r\nyour master!'\r\n\r\nSwift footsteps padded in the corridor outside, and Gebal burst into the\r\nchamber--a Shemite, of medium height and mightily muscled build, his\r\ncurled blue-black beard bristling, and a short leaf-shaped sword in his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nHe stared in stupid amazement at the four invaders, unable to understand\r\ntheir presence; dimly remembering that he had drowsed unexplainably on\r\nthe stair he was guarding and up which they must have come. He had never\r\nslept on duty before. But his master was shrieking with a note of\r\nhysteria in his voice, and the Shemite drove like a bull at the\r\nstrangers, his thickly muscled arm drawing back for the disemboweling\r\nthrust. But the stroke was never dealt.\r\n\r\nA black-sleeved arm shot out, extending the long staff. Its end but\r\ntouched the Shemite's brawny breast and was instantly withdrawn. The\r\nstroke was horribly like the dart and recovery of a serpent's head.\r\n\r\nGebal halted short in his headlong plunge, as if he had encountered a\r\nsolid barrier. His bull head toppled forward on his breast, the sword\r\nslipped from his fingers, and then he melted slowly to the floor. It was\r\nas if all the bones of his frame had suddenly become flabby. Publio\r\nturned sick.\r\n\r\n'Do not shout again,' advised the tallest Khitan. 'Your servants sleep\r\nsoundly, but if you awaken them they will die, and you with them. Where\r\nis Conan?'\r\n\r\n'He is gone to the house of Servio, near the waterfront, to search for\r\nthe Zingaran Beloso,' gasped Publio, all his power of resistance gone\r\nout of him. The merchant did not lack courage; but these uncanny\r\nvisitants turned his marrow to water. He started convulsively at a\r\nsudden noise of footsteps hurrying up the stair outside, loud in the\r\nominous stillness.\r\n\r\n'Your servant?' asked the Khitan.\r\n\r\nPublio shook his head mutely, his tongue frozen to his palate. He could\r\nnot speak.\r\n\r\nOne of the Khitans caught up a silken cover from a couch and threw it\r\nover the corpse. Then they melted behind the tapestry, but before the\r\ntallest man disappeared, he murmured: 'Talk to this man who comes, and\r\nsend him away quickly. If you betray us, neither he nor you will live to\r\nreach that door. Make no sign to show him you are not alone.' And\r\nlifting his staff suggestively, the yellow man faded behind the\r\nhangings.\r\n\r\nPublio shuddered and choked down a desire to retch. It might have been a\r\ntrick of the light, but it seemed to him that occasionally those staffs\r\nmoved slightly of their own accord, as if possessed of an unspeakable\r\nlife of their own.\r\n\r\nHe pulled himself together with a mighty effort, and presented a\r\ncomposed aspect to the ragged ruffian who burst into the chamber.\r\n\r\n'We have done as you wished, my lord,' this man exclaimed. 'The\r\nbarbarian lies dead on the sands at the water's edge.'\r\n\r\nPublio felt a movement in the arras behind him, and almost burst from\r\nfright. The man swept heedlessly on.\r\n\r\n'Your secretary, Tiberio, is dead. The barbarian slew him, and four of\r\nmy companions. We bore their bodies to the rendezvous. There was\r\nnothing of value on the barbarian except a few silver coins. Are there\r\nany further orders?'\r\n\r\n'None!' gasped Publio, white about the lips. 'Go!'\r\n\r\nThe desperado bowed and hurried out, with a vague feeling that Publio\r\nwas both a man of weak stomach and few words.\r\n\r\nThe four Khitans came from behind the arras.\r\n\r\n'Of whom did this man speak?' the taller demanded.\r\n\r\n'Of a wandering stranger who did me an injury,' panted Publio.\r\n\r\n'You lie,' said the Khitan calmly. 'He spoke of the king of Aquilonia.\r\nI read it in your expression. Sit upon that divan and do not move or\r\nspeak. I will remain with you while my three companions go search for\r\nthe body.'\r\n\r\nSo Publio sat and shook with terror of the silent, inscrutable figure\r\nwhich watched him, until the three Khitans filed back into the room,\r\nwith the news that Conan's body did not lie upon the sands. Publio did\r\nnot know whether to be glad or sorry.\r\n\r\n'We found the spot where the fight was fought,' they said. 'Blood was on\r\nthe sand. But the king was gone.'\r\n\r\nThe fourth Khitan drew imaginary symbols upon the carpet with his staff,\r\nwhich glistened scalily in the lamplight.\r\n\r\n'Did you read naught from the sands?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Aye,' they answered. 'The king lives, and he has gone southward in a\r\nship.'\r\n\r\nThe tall Khitan lifted his head and gazed at Publio, so that the\r\nmerchant broke into a profuse sweat.\r\n\r\n'What do you wish of me?' he stuttered.\r\n\r\n'A ship,' answered the Khitan. 'A ship well manned for a very long\r\nvoyage.'\r\n\r\n'For how long a voyage?' stammered Publio, never thinking of refusing.\r\n\r\n'To the ends of the world, perhaps,' answered the Khitan, 'or to the\r\nmolten seas of hell that lie beyond the sunrise.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\nThe Return of the Corsair\r\n\r\n\r\nConan's first sensation of returning consciousness was that of motion;\r\nunder him was no solidity, but a ceaseless heaving and plunging. Then he\r\nheard wind humming through cords and spars, and knew he was aboard a\r\nship even before his blurred sight cleared. He heard a mutter of voices\r\nand then a dash of water deluged him, jerking him sharply into full\r\nanimation. He heaved up with a sulphurous curse, braced his legs and\r\nglared about him, with a burst of coarse guffaws in his ears and the\r\nreek of unwashed bodies in his nostrils.\r\n\r\nHe was standing on the poopdeck of a long galley which was running\r\nbefore the wind that whipped down from the north, her striped sail\r\nbellying against the taut sheets. The sun was just rising, in a dazzling\r\nblaze of gold and blue and green. To the left of the shoreline was a dim\r\npurple shadow. To the right stretched the open ocean. This much Conan\r\nsaw at a glance that likewise included the ship itself.\r\n\r\nIt was long and narrow, a typical trading-ship of the southern coasts,\r\nhigh of poop and stern, with cabins at either extremity. Conan looked\r\ndown into the open waist, whence wafted that sickening abominable odor.\r\nHe knew it of old. It was the body-scent of the oarsmen, chained to\r\ntheir benches. They were all negroes, forty men to each side, each\r\nconfined by a chain locked about his waist, with the other end welded to\r\na heavy ring set deep in the solid runway beam that ran between the\r\nbenches from stem to stern. The life of a slave aboard an Argossean\r\ngalley was a hell unfathomable. Most of these were Kushites, but some\r\nthirty of the blacks who now rested on their idle oars and stared up at\r\nthe stranger with dull curiosity were from the far southern isles, the\r\nhomelands of the corsairs. Conan recognized them by their straighter\r\nfeatures and hair, their rangier, cleaner-limbed build. And he saw among\r\nthem men who had followed him of old.\r\n\r\nBut all this he saw and recognized in one swift, all-embracing glance as\r\nhe rose, before he turned his attention to the figures about him.\r\nReeling momentarily on braced legs, his fists clenched wrathfully, he\r\nglared at the figures clustered about him. The sailor who had drenched\r\nhim stood grinning, the empty bucket still poised in his hand, and Conan\r\ncursed him with venom, instinctively reaching for his hilt. Then he\r\ndiscovered that he was weaponless and naked except for his short leather\r\nbreeks.\r\n\r\n'What lousy tub is this?' he roared. 'How did I come aboard here?'\r\n\r\nThe sailors laughed jeeringly--stocky, bearded Argosseans to a man--and\r\none, whose richer dress and air of command proclaimed him captain,\r\nfolded his arms and said domineeringly: 'We found you lying on the\r\nsands. Somebody had rapped you on the pate and taken your clothes.\r\nNeeding an extra man, we brought you aboard.'\r\n\r\n'What ship is this?' Conan demanded.\r\n\r\n'The _Venturer_, out of Messantia, with a cargo of mirrors, scarlet silk\r\ncloaks, shields, gilded helmets and swords to trade to the Shemites for\r\ncopper and gold ore. I am Demetrio, captain of this vessel and your\r\nmaster henceforward.'\r\n\r\n'Then I'm headed in the direction I wanted to go, after all,' muttered\r\nConan, heedless of that last remark. They were racing southeastward,\r\nfollowing the long curve of the Argossean coast. These trading-ships\r\nnever ventured far from the shoreline. Somewhere ahead of him he knew\r\nthat low dark Stygian galley was speeding southward.\r\n\r\n'Have you sighted a Stygian galley--' began Conan, but the beard of the\r\nburly, brutal-faced captain bristled. He was not in the least interested\r\nin any question his prisoner might wish to ask, and felt it high time he\r\nreduced this independent wastrel to his proper place.\r\n\r\n'Get for'ard!' he roared. 'I've wasted time enough with you! I've done\r\nyou the honor of having you brought to the poop to be revived, and\r\nanswered enough of your infernal questions. Get off this poop! You'll\r\nwork your way aboard this galley--'\r\n\r\n'I'll buy your ship--' began Conan, before he remembered that he was a\r\npenniless wanderer.\r\n\r\nA roar of rough mirth greeted these words, and the captain turned\r\npurple, thinking he sensed ridicule.\r\n\r\n'You mutinous swine!' he bellowed, taking a threatening step forward,\r\nwhile his hand closed on the knife at his belt. 'Get for'ard before I\r\nhave you flogged! You'll keep a civil tongue in your jaws, or by Mitra,\r\nI'll have you chained among the blacks to tug an oar!'\r\n\r\nConan's volcanic temper, never long at best, burst into explosion. Not\r\nin years, even before he was king, had a man spoken to him thus and\r\nlived.\r\n\r\n'Don't lift your voice to me, you tar-breeched dog!' he roared in a\r\nvoice as gusty as the sea-wind, while the sailors gaped dumfounded.\r\n'Draw that toy and I'll feed you to the fishes!'\r\n\r\n'Who do you think you are?' gasped the captain.\r\n\r\n'I'll show you!' roared the maddened Cimmerian, and he wheeled and\r\nbounded toward the rail, where weapons hung in their brackets.\r\n\r\nThe captain drew his knife and ran at him bellowing, but before he could\r\nstrike, Conan gripped his wrist with a wrench that tore the arm clean\r\nout of the socket. The captain bellowed like an ox in agony, and then\r\nrolled clear across the deck as he was hurled contemptuously from his\r\nattacker. Conan ripped a heavy ax from the rail and wheeled cat-like to\r\nmeet the rush of the sailors. They ran in, giving tongue like hounds,\r\nclumsy-footed and awkward in comparison to the pantherish Cimmerian.\r\nBefore they could reach him with their knives he sprang among them,\r\nstriking right and left too quickly for the eye to follow, and blood and\r\nbrains spattered as two corpses struck the deck.\r\n\r\nKnives flailed the air wildly as Conan broke through the stumbling,\r\ngasping mob and bounded to the narrow bridge that spanned the waist from\r\npoop to forecastle, just out of reach of the slaves below. Behind him\r\nthe handful of sailors on the poop were floundering after him, daunted\r\nby the destruction of their fellows, and the rest of the crew--some\r\nthirty in all--came running across the bridge toward him, with weapons\r\nin their hands.\r\n\r\nConan bounded out on the bridge and stood poised above the upturned\r\nblack faces, ax lifted, black mane blown in the wind.\r\n\r\n'Who am I?' he yelled. 'Look, you dogs! Look, Ajonga, Yasunga, Laranga!\r\n_Who am I?_'\r\n\r\nAnd from the waist rose a shout that swelled to a mighty roar: 'Amra! It\r\nis Amra! The Lion has returned!'\r\n\r\nThe sailors who caught and understood the burden of that awesome shout\r\npaled and shrank back, staring in sudden fear at the wild figure on the\r\nbridge. Was this in truth that blood-thirsty ogre of the southern seas\r\nwho had so mysteriously vanished years ago, but who still lived in gory\r\nlegends? The blacks were frothing crazy now, shaking and tearing at\r\ntheir chains and shrieking the name of Amra like an invocation. Kushites\r\nwho had never seen Conan before took up the yell. The slaves in the pen\r\nunder the after-cabin began to batter at the walls, shrieking like the\r\ndamned.\r\n\r\nDemetrio, hitching himself along the deck on one hand and his knees,\r\nlivid with the agony of his dislocated arm, screamed: 'In and kill him,\r\ndogs, before the slaves break loose!'\r\n\r\nFired to desperation by that word, the most dread to all galleymen, the\r\nsailors charged on to the bridge from both ends. But with a lion-like\r\nbound Conan left the bridge and hit like a cat on his feet on the runway\r\nbetween the benches.\r\n\r\n'Death to the masters!' he thundered, and his ax rose and fell\r\ncrashingly full on a shackle-chain, severing it like matchwood. In an\r\ninstant a shrieking slave was free, splintering his oar for a bludgeon.\r\nMen were racing frantically along the bridge above, and all hell and\r\nbedlam broke loose on the _Venturer_. Conan's ax rose and fell without\r\npause, and with every stroke a frothing, screaming black giant broke\r\nfree, mad with hate and the fury of freedom and vengeance.\r\n\r\nSailors leaping down into the waist to grapple or smite at the naked\r\nwhite giant hewing like one possessed at the shackles, found themselves\r\ndragged down by the hands of slaves yet unfreed, while others, their\r\nbroken chains whipping and snapping about their limbs, came up out of\r\nthe waist like a blind, black torrent, screaming like fiends, smiting\r\nwith broken oars and pieces of iron, tearing and rending with talons and\r\nteeth. In the midst of the mêlée the slaves in the pen broke down the\r\nwalls and came surging up on the decks, and with fifty blacks freed of\r\ntheir benches Conan abandoned his iron-hewing and bounded up on the\r\nbridge to add his notched ax to the bludgeons of his partisans.\r\n\r\nThen it was massacre. The Argosseans were strong, sturdy, fearless like\r\nall their race, trained in the brutal school of the sea. But they could\r\nnot stand against these maddened giants, led by the tigerish barbarian.\r\nBlows and abuse and hellish suffering were avenged in one red gust of\r\nfury that raged like a typhoon from one end of the ship to the other,\r\nand when it had blown itself out, but one white man lived aboard the\r\n_Venturer_, and that was the blood-stained giant about whom the chanting\r\nblacks thronged to cast themselves prostrate on the bloody deck and beat\r\ntheir heads against the boards in an ecstasy of hero-worship.\r\n\r\nConan, his mighty chest heaving and glistening with sweat, the red ax\r\ngripped in his blood-smeared hand, glared about him as the first chief\r\nof men might have glared in some primordial dawn, and shook back his\r\nblack mane. In that moment he was not king of Aquilonia; he was again\r\nlord of the black corsairs, who had hacked his way to lordship through\r\nflame and blood.\r\n\r\n'Amra! Amra!' chanted the delirious blacks, those who were left to\r\nchant. 'The Lion has returned! Now will the Stygians howl like dogs in\r\nthe night, and the black dogs of Kush will howl! Now will villages burst\r\nin flames and ships founder! Aie, there will be wailing of women and the\r\nthunder of the spears!'\r\n\r\n'Cease this yammering, dogs!' Conan roared in a voice that drowned the\r\nclap of the sail in the wind. 'Ten of you go below and free the oarsmen\r\nwho are yet chained. The rest of you man the sweeps and bend to oars and\r\nhalyards. Crom's devils, don't you see we've drifted inshore during the\r\nfight? Do you want to run aground and be retaken by the Argosseans?\r\nThrow these carcasses overboard. Jump to it, you rogues, or I'll notch\r\nyour hides for you!'\r\n\r\nWith shouts and laughter and wild singing they leaped to do his\r\ncommands. The corpses, white and black, were hurled overboard, where\r\ntriangular fins were already cutting the water.\r\n\r\nConan stood on the poop, frowning down at the black men who watched him\r\nexpectantly. His heavy brown arms were folded, his black hair, grown\r\nlong in his wanderings, blew in the wind. A wilder and more barbaric\r\nfigure never trod the bridge of a ship, and in this ferocious corsair\r\nfew of the courtiers of Aquilonia would have recognized their king.\r\n\r\n'There's food in the hold!' he roared. 'Weapons in plenty for you, for\r\nthis ship carried blades and harness to the Shemites who dwell along the\r\ncoast. There are enough of us to work ship, aye, and to fight! You rowed\r\nin chains for the Argossean dogs: will you row as free men for Amra?'\r\n\r\n'_Aye!_' they roared. 'We are thy children! Lead us where you will!'\r\n\r\n'Then fall to and clean out that waist,' he commanded. 'Free men don't\r\nlabor in such filth. Three of you come with me and break out food from\r\nthe after-cabin. By Crom, I'll pad out your ribs before this cruise is\r\ndone.'\r\n\r\nAnother yell of approbation answered him, as the half-starved blacks\r\nscurried to do his bidding. The sail bellied as the wind swept over the\r\nwaves with renewed force, and the white crests danced along the sweep of\r\nthe wind. Conan planted his feet to the heave of the deck, breathed deep\r\nand spread his mighty arms. King of Aquilonia he might no longer be;\r\nking of the blue ocean he was still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\nBlack-Walled Khemi\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Venturer_ swept southward like a living thing, her oars pulled now\r\nby free and willing hands. She had been transformed from a peaceful\r\ntrader into a war-galley, insofar as the transformation was possible.\r\nMen sat at the benches now with swords at their sides and gilded helmets\r\non their kinky heads. Shields were hung along the rails, and sheafs of\r\nspears, bows and arrows adorned the mast. Even the elements seemed to\r\nwork for Conan now; the broad purple sail bellied to a stiff breeze that\r\nheld day by day, needing little aid from the oars.\r\n\r\nBut though Conan kept a man on the masthead day and night, they did not\r\nsight a long, low, black galley fleeing southward ahead of them. Day by\r\nday the blue waters rolled empty to their view, broken only by\r\nfishing-craft which fled like frightened birds before them, at sight of\r\nthe shields hung along the rail. The season for trading was practically\r\nover for the year, and they sighted no other ships.\r\n\r\nWhen the lookout did sight a sail, it was to the north, not the south.\r\nFar on the skyline behind them appeared a racing-galley, with full\r\nspread of purple sail. The blacks urged Conan to turn and plunder it,\r\nbut he shook his head. Somewhere south of him a slim black galley was\r\nracing toward the ports of Stygia. That night, before darkness shut\r\ndown, the lookout's last glimpse showed him the racing-galley on the\r\nhorizon, and at dawn it was still hanging on their tail, afar off, tiny\r\nin the distance. Conan wondered if it was following him, though he could\r\nthink of no logical reason for such a supposition. But he paid little\r\nheed.\r\n\r\nEach day that carried him farther southward filled him with fiercer\r\nimpatience. Doubts never assailed him. As he believed in the rise and\r\nset of the sun he believed that a priest of Set had stolen the Heart of\r\nAhriman. And where would a priest of Set carry it but to Stygia? The\r\nblacks sensed his eagerness, and toiled as they had never toiled under\r\nthe lash, though ignorant of his goal. They anticipated a red career of\r\npillage and plunder and were content. The men of the southern isles knew\r\nno other trade; and the Kushites of the crew joined whole-heartedly in\r\nthe prospect of looting their own people, with the callousness of their\r\nrace. Blood-ties meant little; a victorious chieftain and personal gain\r\neverything.\r\n\r\nSoon the character of the coastline changed. No longer they sailed past\r\nsteep cliffs with blue hills marching behind them. Now the shore was the\r\nedge of broad meadowlands which barely rose above the water's edge and\r\nswept away and away into the hazy distance. Here were few harbors and\r\nfewer ports, but the green plain was dotted with the cities of the\r\nShemites; green sea, lapping the rim of the green plains, and the\r\nziggurats of the cities gleaming whitely in the sun, some small in the\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nThrough the grazing-lands moved the herds of cattle, and squat, broad\r\nriders with cylindrical helmets and curled blue-black beards, with bows\r\nin their hands. This was the shore of the lands of Shem, where there was\r\nno law save as each city-state could enforce its own. Far to the\r\neastward, Conan knew, the meadowlands gave way to desert, where there\r\nwere no cities and the nomadic tribes roamed unhindered.\r\n\r\nStill as they plied southward, past the changeless panorama of\r\ncity-dotted meadowland, at last the scenery again began to alter. Clumps\r\nof tamarind appeared, the palm groves grew denser. The shoreline became\r\nmore broken, a marching rampart of green fronds and trees, and behind\r\nthem rose bare, sandy hills. Streams poured into the sea, and along\r\ntheir moist banks vegetation grew thick and of vast variety.\r\n\r\nSo at last they passed the mouth of a broad river that mingled its flow\r\nwith the ocean, and saw the great black walls and towers of Khemi rise\r\nagainst the southern horizon.\r\n\r\nThe river was the Styx, the real border of Stygia. Khemi was Stygia's\r\ngreatest port, and at that time her most important city. The king dwelt\r\nat more ancient Luxur, but in Khemi reigned the priestcraft; though men\r\nsaid the center of their dark religion lay far inland, in a mysterious,\r\ndeserted city near the bank of the Styx. This river, springing from some\r\nnameless source far in the unknown lands south of Stygia, ran northward\r\nfor a thousand miles before it turned and flowed westward for some\r\nhundreds of miles, to empty at last into the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe _Venturer_, showing no lights, stole past the port in the night, and\r\nbefore dawn discovered her, anchored in a small bay a few miles south of\r\nthe city. It was surrounded by marsh, a green tangle of mangroves, palms\r\nand lianas, swarming with crocodiles and serpents. Discovery was\r\nextremely unlikely. Conan knew the place of old; he had hidden there\r\nbefore, in his corsair days.\r\n\r\nAs they slid silently past the city whose great black bastions rose on\r\nthe jutting prongs of land which locked the harbor, torches gleamed and\r\nsmoldered luridly, and to their ears came the low thunder of drums. The\r\nport was not crowded with ships, as were the harbors of Argos. The\r\nStygians did not base their glory and power upon ships and fleets.\r\nTrading-vessels and war-galleys, indeed, they had, but not in proportion\r\nto their inland strength. Many of their craft plied up and down the\r\ngreat river, rather than along the sea-coasts.\r\n\r\nThe Stygians were an ancient race, a dark, inscrutable people, powerful\r\nand merciless. Long ago their rule had stretched far north of the Styx,\r\nbeyond the meadowlands of Shem, and into the fertile uplands now\r\ninhabited by the peoples of Koth and Ophir and Argos. Their borders had\r\nmarched with those of ancient Acheron. But Acheron had fallen, and the\r\nbarbaric ancestors of the Hyborians had swept southward in wolfskins and\r\nhorned helmets, driving the ancient rulers of the land before them. The\r\nStygians had not forgotten.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAll day the _Venturer_ lay at anchor in the tiny bay, walled in with\r\ngreen branches and tangled vines through which flitted gay-plumed,\r\nharsh-voiced birds, and among which glided bright-scaled, silent\r\nreptiles. Toward sundown a small boat crept out and down along the\r\nshore, seeking and finding that which Conan desired--a Stygian fisherman\r\nin his shallow, flat-prowed boat.\r\n\r\nThey brought him to the deck of the _Venturer_--a tall, dark, rangily\r\nbuilt man, ashy with fear of his captors, who were ogres of that coast.\r\nHe was naked except for his silken breeks, for, like the Hyrkanians,\r\neven the commoners and slaves of Stygia wore silk; and in his boat was a\r\nwide mantle such as these fishermen flung about their shoulders against\r\nthe chill of the night.\r\n\r\nHe fell to his knees before Conan, expecting torture and death.\r\n\r\n'Stand on your legs, man, and quit trembling,' said the Cimmerian\r\nimpatiently, who found it difficult to understand abject terror. 'You\r\nwon't be harmed. Tell me but this: has a galley, a black racing-galley\r\nreturning from Argos, put into Khemi within the last few days?'\r\n\r\n'Aye, my lord,' answered the fisherman. 'Only yesterday at dawn the\r\npriest Thutothmes returned from a voyage far to the north. Men say he\r\nhas been to Messantia.'\r\n\r\n'What did he bring from Messantia?'\r\n\r\n'Alas, my lord, I know not.'\r\n\r\n'Why did he go to Messantia?' demanded Conan.\r\n\r\n'Nay, my lord, I am but a common man. Who am I to know the minds of the\r\npriests of Set? I can only speak what I have seen and what I have heard\r\nmen whisper along the wharves. Men say that news of great import came\r\nsouthward, though of what none knows; and it is well known that the lord\r\nThutothmes put off in his black galley in great haste. Now he is\r\nreturned, but what he did in Argos, or what cargo he brought back, none\r\nknows, not even the seamen who manned his galley. Men say that he has\r\nopposed Thoth-Amon, who is the master of all priests of Set, and dwells\r\nin Luxur, and that Thutothmes seeks hidden power to overthrow the Great\r\nOne. But who am I to say? When priests war with one another a common man\r\ncan but lie on his belly and hope neither treads upon him.'\r\n\r\nConan snarled in nervous exasperation at this servile philosophy, and\r\nturned to his men. 'I'm going alone into Khemi to find this thief\r\nThutothmes. Keep this man prisoner, but see that you do him no hurt.\r\nCrom's devils, stop your yowling! Do you think we can sail into the\r\nharbor and take the city by storm? I must go alone.'\r\n\r\nSilencing the clamor of protests, he doffed his own garments and donned\r\nthe prisoner's silk breeches and sandals, and the band from the man's\r\nhair, but scorned the short fisherman's knife. The common men of Stygia\r\nwere not allowed to wear swords, and the mantle was not voluminous\r\nenough to hide the Cimmerian's long blade, but Conan buckled to his hip\r\na Ghanata knife, a weapon borne by the fierce desert men who dwelt to\r\nthe south of the Stygians, a broad, heavy, slightly curved blade of fine\r\nsteel, edged like a razor and long enough to dismember a man.\r\n\r\nThen, leaving the Stygian guarded by the corsairs, Conan climbed into\r\nthe fisher's boat.\r\n\r\n'Wait for me until dawn,' he said. 'If I haven't come then, I'll never\r\ncome, so hasten southward to your own homes.'\r\n\r\nAs he clambered over the rail, they set up a doleful wail at his going,\r\nuntil he thrust his head back into sight to curse them into silence.\r\nThen, dropping into the boat, he grasped the oars and sent the tiny\r\ncraft shooting over the waves more swiftly than its owner had ever\r\npropelled it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n'He Has Slain the Sacred Son of Set!'\r\n\r\n\r\nThe harbor of Khemi lay between two great jutting points of land that\r\nran into the ocean. He rounded the southern point, where the great black\r\ncastles rose like a man-made hill, and entered the harbor just at dusk,\r\nwhen there was still enough light for the watchers to recognize the\r\nfisherman's boat and mantle, but not enough to permit recognition of\r\nbetraying details. Unchallenged he threaded his way among the great\r\nblack war galleys lying silent and unlighted at anchor, and drew up to a\r\nflight of wide stone steps which mounted up from the water's edge. There\r\nhe made his boat fast to an iron ring set in the stone, as numerous\r\nsimilar craft were tied. There was nothing strange in a fisherman\r\nleaving his boat there. None but a fisherman could find a use for such a\r\ncraft, and they did not steal from one another.\r\n\r\nNo one cast him more than a casual glance as he mounted the long steps,\r\nunobtrusively avoiding the torches that flared at intervals above the\r\nlapping black water. He seemed but an ordinary, empty-handed fisherman,\r\nreturning after a fruitless day along the coast. If one had observed him\r\nclosely, it might have seemed that his step was somewhat too springy and\r\nsure, his carriage somewhat too erect and confident for a lowly\r\nfisherman. But he passed quickly, keeping in the shadows, and the\r\ncommoners of Stygia were no more given to analysis than were the\r\ncommoners of the less exotic races.\r\n\r\nIn build he was not unlike the warrior casts of the Stygians, who were a\r\ntall, muscular race. Bronzed by the sun, he was nearly as dark as many\r\nof them. His black hair, square-cut and confined by a copper band,\r\nincreased the resemblance. The characteristics which set him apart from\r\nthem were the subtle difference in his walk, and his alien features and\r\nblue eyes.\r\n\r\nBut the mantle was a good disguise, and he kept as much in the shadows\r\nas possible, turning away his head when a native passed him too closely.\r\n\r\nBut it was a desperate game, and he knew he could not long keep up the\r\ndeception. Khemi was not like the sea-ports of the Hyborians, where\r\ntypes of every race swarmed. The only aliens here were negro and Shemite\r\nslaves; and he resembled neither even as much as he resembled the\r\nStygians themselves. Strangers were not welcome in the cities of Stygia;\r\ntolerated only when they came as ambassadors or licensed traders. But\r\neven then the latter were not allowed ashore after dark. And now there\r\nwere no Hyborian ships in the harbor at all. A strange restlessness ran\r\nthrough the city, a stirring of ancient ambitions, a whispering none\r\ncould define except those who whispered. This Conan felt rather than\r\nknew, his whetted primitive instincts sensing unrest about him.\r\n\r\nIf he were discovered his fate would be ghastly. They would slay him\r\nmerely for being a stranger; if he were recognized as Amra, the corsair\r\nchief who had swept their coasts with steel and flame--an involuntary\r\nshudder twitched Conan's broad shoulders. Human foes he did not fear,\r\nnor any death by steel or fire. But this was a black land of sorcery and\r\nnameless horror. Set the Old Serpent, men said, banished long ago from\r\nthe Hyborian races, yet lurked in the shadows of the cryptic temples,\r\nand awful and mysterious were the deeds done in the nighted shrines.\r\n\r\nHe had drawn away from the waterfront streets with their broad steps\r\nleading down to the water, and was entering the long shadowy streets of\r\nthe main part of the city. There was no such scene as was offered by any\r\nHyborian city--no blaze of lamps and cressets, with gay-clad people\r\nlaughing and strolling along the pavements, and shops and stalls wide\r\nopen and displaying their wares.\r\n\r\nHere the stalls were closed at dusk. The only lights along the streets\r\nwere torches, flaring smokily at wide intervals. People walking the\r\nstreets were comparatively few; they went hurriedly and unspeaking, and\r\ntheir numbers decreased with the lateness of the hour. Conan found the\r\nscene gloomy and unreal; the silence of the people, their furtive haste,\r\nthe great black stone walls that rose on each side of the streets. There\r\nwas a grim massiveness about Stygian architecture that was overpowering\r\nand oppressive.\r\n\r\nFew lights showed anywhere except in the upper parts of the buildings.\r\nConan knew that most of the people lay on the flat roofs, among the\r\npalms of artificial gardens under the stars. There was a murmur of weird\r\nmusic from somewhere. Occasionally a bronze chariot rumbled along the\r\nflags, and there was a brief glimpse of a tall, hawk-faced noble, with a\r\nsilk cloak wrapped about him, and a gold band with a rearing\r\nserpent-head emblem confining his black mane; of the ebon, naked\r\ncharioteer bracing his knotty legs against the straining of the fierce\r\nStygian horses.\r\n\r\nBut the people who yet traversed the streets on foot were commoners,\r\nslaves, tradesmen, harlots, toilers, and they became fewer as he\r\nprogressed. He was making toward the temple of Set, where he knew he\r\nwould be likely to find the priest he sought. He believed he would know\r\nThutothmes if he saw him, though his one glance had been in the\r\nsemi-darkness of the Messantian alley. That the man he had seen there\r\nhad been the priest he was certain. Only occultists high in the mazes of\r\nthe hideous Black Ring possessed the power of the black hand that dealt\r\ndeath by its touch; and only such a man would dare defy Thoth-Amon, whom\r\nthe western world knew only as a figure of terror and myth.\r\n\r\nThe street broadened, and Conan was aware that he was getting into the\r\npart of the city dedicated to the temples. The great structures reared\r\ntheir black bulks against the dim stars, grim, indescribably menacing in\r\nthe flare of the few torches. And suddenly he heard a low scream from a\r\nwoman on the other side of the street and somewhat ahead of him--a naked\r\ncourtesan wearing the tall plumed head-dress of her class. She was\r\nshrinking back against the wall, staring across at something he could\r\nnot yet see. At her cry the few people on the street halted suddenly as\r\nif frozen. At the same instant Conan was aware of a sinister slithering\r\nahead of him. Then about the dark corner of the building he was\r\napproaching poked a hideous, wedge-shaped head, and after it flowed coil\r\nafter coil of rippling, darkly glistening trunk.\r\n\r\nThe Cimmerian recoiled, remembering tales he had heard--serpents were\r\nsacred to Set, god of Stygia, who men said was himself a serpent.\r\nMonsters such as this were kept in the temples of Set, and when they\r\nhungered, were allowed to crawl forth into the streets to take what prey\r\nthey wished. Their ghastly feasts were considered a sacrifice to the\r\nscaly god.\r\n\r\nThe Stygians within Conan's sight fell to their knees, men and women,\r\nand passively awaited their fate. One the great serpent would select,\r\nwould lap in scaly coils, crush to a red pulp and swallow as a rat-snake\r\nswallows a mouse. The others would live. That was the will of the gods.\r\n\r\nBut it was not Conan's will. The python glided toward him, its attention\r\nprobably attracted by the fact that he was the only human in sight still\r\nstanding erect. Gripping his great knife under his mantle, Conan hoped\r\nthe slimy brute would pass him by. But it halted before him and reared\r\nup horrifically in the flickering torchlight, its forked tongue\r\nflickering in and out, its cold eyes glittering with the ancient cruelty\r\nof the serpent-folk. Its neck arched, but before it could dart, Conan\r\nwhipped his knife from under his mantle and struck like a flicker of\r\nlightning. The broad blade split that wedge-shaped head and sheared deep\r\ninto the thick neck.\r\n\r\nConan wrenched his knife free and sprang clear as the great body knotted\r\nand looped and whipped terrifically in its death throes. In the moment\r\nthat he stood staring in morbid fascination, the only sound was the thud\r\nand swish of the snake's tail against the stones.\r\n\r\nThen from the shocked votaries burst a terrible cry: 'Blasphemer! He has\r\nslain the sacred son of Set! Slay him! Slay! Slay!'\r\n\r\nStones whizzed about him and the crazed Stygians rushed at him,\r\nshrieking hysterically, while from all sides others emerged from their\r\nhouses and took up the cry. With a curse Conan wheeled and darted into\r\nthe black mouth of an alley. He heard the patter of bare feet on the\r\nflags behind him as he ran more by feel than by sight, and the walls\r\nresounded to the vengeful yells of the pursuers. Then his left hand\r\nfound a break in the wall, and he turned sharply into another, narrower\r\nalley. On both sides rose sheer black stone walls. High above him he\r\ncould see a thin line of stars. These giant walls, he knew, were the\r\nwalls of temples. He heard, behind him, the pack sweep past the dark\r\nmouth in full cry. Their shouts grew distant, faded away. They had\r\nmissed the smaller alley and run straight on in the blackness. He too\r\nkept straight ahead, though the thought of encountering another of Set's\r\n'sons' in the darkness brought a shudder from him.\r\n\r\nThen somewhere ahead of him he caught a moving glow, like that of a\r\ncrawling glow-worm. He halted, flattened himself against the wall and\r\ngripped his knife. He knew what it was: a man approaching with a torch.\r\nNow it was so close he could make out the dark hand that gripped it, and\r\nthe dim oval of a dark face. A few more steps and the man would\r\ncertainly see him. He sank into a tigerish crouch--the torch halted. A\r\ndoor was briefly etched in the glow, while the torch-bearer fumbled with\r\nit. Then it opened, the tall figure vanished through it, and darkness\r\nclosed again on the alley. There was a sinister suggestion of\r\nfurtiveness about that slinking figure, entering the alley-door in\r\ndarkness; a priest, perhaps, returning from some dark errand.\r\n\r\nBut Conan groped toward the door. If one man came up that alley with a\r\ntorch, others might come at any time. To retreat the way he had come\r\nmight mean to run full into the mob from which he was fleeing. At any\r\nmoment they might return, find the narrower alley and come howling down\r\nit. He felt hemmed in by those sheer, unscalable walls, desirous of\r\nescape, even if escape meant invading some unknown building.\r\n\r\nThe heavy bronze door was not locked. It opened under his fingers and he\r\npeered through the crack. He was looking into a great square chamber of\r\nmassive black stone. A torch smoldered in a niche in the wall. The\r\nchamber was empty. He glided through the lacquered door and closed it\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\nHis sandaled feet made no sound as he crossed the black marble floor. A\r\nteak door stood partly open, and gliding through this, knife in hand, he\r\ncame out into a great, dim, shadowy place whose lofty ceiling was only a\r\nhint of darkness high above him, toward which the black walls swept\r\nupward. On all sides black-arched doorways opened into the great still\r\nhall. It was lit by curious bronze lamps that gave a dim weird light. On\r\nthe other side of the great hall a broad black marble stairway, without\r\na railing, marched upward to lose itself in gloom, and above him on all\r\nsides dim galleries hung like black stone ledges.\r\n\r\nConan shivered; he was in a temple of some Stygian god, if not Set\r\nhimself, then someone barely less grim. And the shrine did not lack an\r\noccupant. In the midst of the great hall stood a black stone altar,\r\nmassive, somber, without carvings or ornament, and upon it coiled one of\r\nthe great sacred serpents, its iridescent scales shimmering in the\r\nlamplight. It did not move, and Conan remembered stories that the\r\npriests kept these creatures drugged part of the time. The Cimmerian\r\ntook an uncertain step out from the door, then shrank back suddenly,\r\nnot into the room he had just quitted, but into a velvet-curtained\r\nrecess. He had heard a soft step somewhere near by.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the black arches emerged a tall, powerful figure in sandals\r\nand silken loin-cloth, with a wide mantle trailing from his shoulders.\r\nBut face and head were hidden by a monstrous mask, a half-bestial,\r\nhalf-human countenance, from the crest of which floated a mass of\r\nostrich plumes.\r\n\r\nIn certain ceremonies the Stygian priests went masked. Conan hoped the\r\nman would not discover him, but some instinct warned the Stygian. He\r\nturned abruptly from his destination, which apparently was the stair,\r\nand stepped straight to the recess. As he jerked aside the velvet\r\nhanging, a hand darted from the shadows, crushed the cry in his throat\r\nand jerked him headlong into the alcove, and the knife impaled him.\r\n\r\nConan's next move was the obvious one suggested by logic. He lifted off\r\nthe grinning mask and drew it over his own head. The fisherman's mantle\r\nhe flung over the body of the priest, which he concealed behind the\r\nhangings, and drew the priestly mantle about his own brawny shoulders.\r\nFate had given him a disguise. All Khemi might well be searching now for\r\nthe blasphemer who dared defend himself against a sacred snake; but who\r\nwould dream of looking for him under the mask of a priest?\r\n\r\nHe strode boldly from the alcove and headed for one of the arched\r\ndoorways at random; but he had not taken a dozen strides when he wheeled\r\nagain, all his senses edged for peril.\r\n\r\nA band of masked figures filed down the stair, appareled exactly as he\r\nwas. He hesitated, caught in the open, and stood still, trusting to his\r\ndisguise, though cold sweat gathered on his forehead and the backs of\r\nhis hands. No word was spoken. Like phantoms they descended into the\r\ngreat hall and moved past him toward a black arch. The leader carried an\r\nebon staff which supported a grinning white skull, and Conan knew it was\r\none of the ritualistic processions so inexplicable to a foreigner, but\r\nwhich played a strong--and often sinister--part in the Stygian religion.\r\nThe last figure turned his head slightly toward the motionless\r\nCimmerian, as if expecting him to follow. Not to do what was obviously\r\nexpected of him would rouse instant suspicion. Conan fell in behind the\r\nlast man and suited his gait to their measured pace.\r\n\r\nThey traversed a long, dark, vaulted corridor in which, Conan noticed\r\nuneasily, the skull on the staff glowed phosphorescently. He felt a\r\nsurge of unreasoning, wild animal panic that urged him to rip out his\r\nknife and slash right and left at these uncanny figures, to flee madly\r\nfrom the grim, dark temple. But he held himself in check, fighting down\r\nthe dim monstrous intuitions that rose in the back of his mind and\r\npeopled the gloom with shadowy shapes of horror; and presently he barely\r\nstifled a sigh of relief as they filed through a great double-valved\r\ndoor which was three times higher than a man, and emerged into the\r\nstarlight.\r\n\r\nConan wondered if he dared fade into some dark alley; but hesitated,\r\nuncertain, and down the long dark street they padded silently, while\r\nsuch folk as they met turned their heads away and fled from them. The\r\nprocession kept far out from the walls; to turn and bolt into any of the\r\nalleys they passed would be too conspicuous. While he mentally fumed and\r\ncursed, they came to a low-arched gateway in the southern wall, and\r\nthrough this they filed. Ahead of them and about them lay clusters of\r\nlow, flat-topped mud houses, and palm-groves, shadowy in the starlight.\r\nNow if ever, thought Conan, was his time to escape his silent\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nBut the moment the gate was left behind them those companions were no\r\nlonger silent. They began to mutter excitedly among themselves. The\r\nmeasured, ritualistic gait was abandoned, the staff with its skull was\r\ntucked unceremoniously under the leader's arm, and the whole group broke\r\nranks and hurried onward. And Conan hurried with them. For in the low\r\nmurmur of speech he had caught a word that galvanized him. The word was:\r\n\"_Thutothmes!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n'I Am the Woman Who Never Died'\r\n\r\n\r\nConan stared with burning interest at his masked companions. One of them\r\nwas Thutothmes, or else the destination of the band was a rendezvous\r\nwith the man he sought. And he knew what that destination was, when\r\nbeyond the palms he glimpsed a black triangular bulk looming against the\r\nshadowy sky.\r\n\r\nThey passed through the belt of huts and groves, and if any man saw them\r\nhe was careful not to show himself. The huts were dark. Behind them the\r\nblack towers of Khemi rose gloomily against the stars that were mirrored\r\nin the waters of the harbor; ahead of them the desert stretched away in\r\ndim darkness; somewhere a jackal yapped. The quick-passing sandals of\r\nthe silent neophytes made no noise in the sand. They might have been\r\nghosts, moving toward that colossal pyramid that rose out of the murk of\r\nthe desert. There was no sound over all the sleeping land.\r\n\r\nConan's heart beat quicker as he gazed at the grim black wedge that\r\nstood etched against the stars, and his impatience to close with\r\nThutothmes in whatever conflict the meeting might mean was not unmixed\r\nwith a fear of the unknown. No man could approach one of those somber\r\npiles of black stone without apprehension. The very name was a symbol of\r\nrepellent horror among the northern nations, and legends hinted that the\r\nStygians did not build them; that they were in the land at whatever\r\nimmeasurably ancient date the dark-skinned people came into the land of\r\nthe great river.\r\n\r\nAs they approached the pyramid he glimpsed a dim glow near the base\r\nwhich presently resolved itself into a doorway, on either side of which\r\nbrooded stone lions with the heads of women, cryptic, inscrutable,\r\nnightmares crystalized in stone. The leader of the band made straight\r\nfor the doorway, in the deep well of which Conan saw a shadowy figure.\r\n\r\nThe leader paused an instant beside this dim figure, and then vanished\r\ninto the dark interior, and one by one the others followed. As each\r\nmasked priest passed through the gloomy portal he was halted briefly by\r\nthe mysterious guardian and something passed between them, some word or\r\ngesture Conan could not make out. Seeing this, the Cimmerian purposely\r\nlagged behind, and stooping, pretended to be fumbling with the fastening\r\nof his sandal. Not until the last of the masked figures had disappeared\r\ndid he straighten and approach the portal.\r\n\r\nHe was uneasily wondering if the guardian of the temple were human,\r\nremembering some tales he had heard. But his doubts were set at rest. A\r\ndim bronze cresset glowing just within the door lighted a long narrow\r\ncorridor that ran away into blackness, and a man standing silent in the\r\nmouth of it, wrapped in a wide black cloak. No one else was in sight.\r\nObviously the masked priests had disappeared down the corridor.\r\n\r\nOver the cloak that was drawn about his lower features, the Stygian's\r\npiercing eyes regarded Conan sharply. With his left hand he made a\r\ncurious gesture. On a venture Conan imitated it. But evidently another\r\ngesture was expected; the Stygian's right hand came from under his cloak\r\nwith a gleam of steel and his murderous stab would have pierced the\r\nheart of an ordinary man.\r\n\r\nBut he was dealing with one whose thews were nerved to the quickness of\r\na jungle cat. Even as the dagger flashed in the dim light, Conan caught\r\nthe dusky wrist and smashed his clenched right fist against the\r\nStygian's jaw. The man's head went back against the stone wall with a\r\ndull crunch that told of a fractured skull.\r\n\r\nStanding for an instant above him, Conan listened intently. The cresset\r\nburned low, casting vague shadows about the door. Nothing stirred in the\r\nblackness beyond, though far away and below him, as it seemed, he caught\r\nthe faint, muffled note of a gong.\r\n\r\nHe stooped and dragged the body behind the great bronze door which stood\r\nwide, opened inward, and then the Cimmerian went warily but swiftly down\r\nthe corridor, toward what doom he did not even try to guess.\r\n\r\nHe had not gone far when he halted, baffled. The corridor split in two\r\nbranches, and he had no way of knowing which the masked priests had\r\ntaken. At a venture he chose the left. The floor slanted slightly\r\ndownward and was worn smooth as by many feet. Here and there a dim\r\ncresset cast a faint nightmarish twilight. Conan wondered uneasily for\r\nwhat purpose these colossal piles had been reared, in what forgotten\r\nage. This was an ancient, ancient land. No man knew how many ages the\r\nblack temples of Stygia had looked against the stars.\r\n\r\nNarrow black arches opened occasionally to right and left, but he kept\r\nto the main corridor, although a conviction that he had taken the wrong\r\nbranch was growing in him. Even with their start on him, he should have\r\novertaken the priests by this time. He was growing nervous. The silence\r\nwas like a tangible thing, and yet he had a feeling that he was not\r\nalone. More than once, passing a nighted arch he seemed to feel the\r\nglare of unseen eyes fixed upon him. He paused, half minded to turn back\r\nto where the corridor had first branched. He wheeled abruptly, knife\r\nlifted, every nerve tingling.\r\n\r\nA girl stood at the mouth of a smaller tunnel, staring fixedly at him.\r\nHer ivory skin showed her to be Stygian of some ancient noble family,\r\nand like all such women she was tall, lithe, voluptuously figured, her\r\nhair a great pile of black foam, among which gleamed a sparkling ruby.\r\nBut for her velvet sandals and broad jewel-crusted girdle about her\r\nsupple waist she was quite nude.\r\n\r\n'What do you here?' she demanded.\r\n\r\nTo answer would betray his alien origin. He remained motionless, a grim,\r\nsomber figure in the hideous mask with the plumes floating over him. His\r\nalert gaze sought the shadows behind her and found them empty. But there\r\nmight be hordes of fighting-men within her call.\r\n\r\nShe advanced toward him, apparently without apprehension though with\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\n'You are not a priest,' she said. 'You are a fighting-man. Even with\r\nthat mask that is plain. There is as much difference between you and a\r\npriest as there is between a man and a woman. By Set!' she exclaimed,\r\nhalting suddenly, her eyes flaring wide. 'I do not believe you are even\r\na Stygian!'\r\n\r\nWith a movement too quick for the eye to follow, his hand closed about\r\nher round throat, lightly as a caress.\r\n\r\n'Not a sound out of you!' he muttered.\r\n\r\nHer smooth ivory flesh was cold as marble, yet there was no fear in the\r\nwide, dark, marvelous eyes which regarded him.\r\n\r\n'Do not fear,' she answered calmly. 'I will not betray you. But are you\r\nmad to come, a stranger and a foreigner, to the forbidden temple of\r\nSet?'\r\n\r\n'I'm looking for the priest Thutothmes,' he answered. 'Is he in this\r\ntemple?'\r\n\r\n'Why do you seek him?' she parried.\r\n\r\n'He has something of mine which was stolen.'\r\n\r\n'I will lead you to him,' she volunteered so promptly that his\r\nsuspicions were instantly roused.\r\n\r\n'Don't play with me, girl,' he growled.\r\n\r\n'I do not play with you. I have no love for Thutothmes.'\r\n\r\nHe hesitated, then made up his mind; after all, he was as much in her\r\npower as she was in his.\r\n\r\n'Walk beside me,' he commanded, shifting his grasp from her throat to\r\nher wrist. 'But walk with care. If you make a suspicious move--'\r\n\r\nShe led him down the slanting corridor, down and down, until there were\r\nno more cressets, and he groped his way in darkness, aware less by sight\r\nthan by feel and sense of the woman at his side. Once when he spoke to\r\nher, she turned her head toward him and he was startled to see her eyes\r\nglowing like golden fire in the dark. Dim doubts and vague monstrous\r\nsuspicions haunted his mind, but he followed her, through a labyrinthine\r\nmaze of black corridors that confused even his primitive sense of\r\ndirection. He mentally cursed himself for a fool, allowing himself to be\r\nled into that black abode of mystery; but it was too late to turn back\r\nnow. Again he felt life and movement in the darkness about him, sensed\r\nperil and hunger burning impatiently in the blackness. Unless his ears\r\ndeceived him he caught a faint sliding noise that ceased and receded at\r\na muttered command from the girl.\r\n\r\nShe led him at last into a chamber lighted by a curious seven-branched\r\ncandelabrum in which black candles burned weirdly. He knew they were far\r\nbelow the earth. The chamber was square, with walls and ceiling of\r\npolished black marble and furnished after the manner of the ancient\r\nStygians; there was a couch of ebony, covered with black velvet, and on\r\na black stone dais lay a carven mummy-case.\r\n\r\nConan stood waiting expectantly, staring at the various black arches\r\nwhich opened into the chamber. But the girl made no move to go farther.\r\nStretching herself on the couch with feline suppleness, she intertwined\r\nher fingers behind her sleek head and regarded him from under long\r\ndrooping lashes.\r\n\r\n'Well?' he demanded impatiently. 'What are you doing? Where's\r\nThutothmes?'\r\n\r\n'There is no haste,' she answered lazily. 'What is an hour--or a day, or\r\na year, or a century, for that matter? Take off your mask. Let me see\r\nyour features.'\r\n\r\nWith a grunt of annoyance Conan dragged off the bulky headpiece, and the\r\ngirl nodded as if in approval as she scanned his dark scarred face and\r\nblazing eyes.\r\n\r\n'There is strength in you--great strength; you could strangle a\r\nbullock.'\r\n\r\nHe moved restlessly, his suspicion growing. With his hand on his hilt he\r\npeered into the gloomy arches.\r\n\r\n'If you've brought me into a trap,' he said, 'you won't live to enjoy\r\nyour handiwork. Are you going to get off that couch and do as you\r\npromised, or do I have to--'\r\n\r\nHis voice trailed away. He was staring at the mummy-case, on which the\r\ncountenance of the occupant was carved in ivory with the startling\r\nvividness of a forgotten art. There was a disquieting familiarity about\r\nthat carven mask, and with something of a shock he realized what it was;\r\nthere was a startling resemblance between it and the face of the girl\r\nlolling on the ebon couch. She might have been the model from which it\r\nwas carved, but he knew the portrait was at least centuries old. Archaic\r\nhieroglyphics were scrawled across the lacquered lid, and, seeking back\r\ninto his mind for tag-ends of learning, picked up here and there as\r\nincidentals of an adventurous life, he spelled them out, and said aloud:\r\n'Akivasha!'\r\n\r\n'You have heard of Princess Akivasha?' inquired the girl on the couch.\r\n\r\n'Who hasn't?' he grunted. The name of that ancient, evil, beautiful\r\nprincess still lived the world over in song and legend, though ten\r\nthousand years had rolled their cycles since the daughter of Tuthamon\r\nhad reveled in purple feasts amid the black halls of ancient Luxur.\r\n\r\n'Her only sin was that she loved life and all the meanings of life,'\r\nsaid the Stygian girl. 'To win life she courted death. She could not\r\nbear to think of growing old and shriveled and worn, and dying at last\r\nas hags die. She wooed Darkness like a lover and his gift was life--life\r\nthat, not being life as mortals know it, can never grow old and fade.\r\nShe went into the shadows to cheat age and death--'\r\n\r\nConan glared at her with eyes that were suddenly burning slits. And he\r\nwheeled and tore the lid from the sarcophagus. It was empty. Behind him\r\nthe girl was laughing and the sound froze the blood in his veins. He\r\nwhirled back to her, the short hairs on his neck bristling.\r\n\r\n'You are Akivasha!' he grated.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and shook back her burnished locks, spread her arms\r\nsensuously.\r\n\r\n'I am Akivasha! I am the woman who never died, who never grew old! Who\r\nfools say was lifted from the earth by the gods, in the full bloom of\r\nher youth and beauty, to queen it for ever in some celestial clime! Nay,\r\nit is in the shadows that mortals find immortality! Ten thousand years\r\nago I died to live for ever! Give me your lips, strong man!'\r\n\r\nRising lithely she came to him, rose on tiptoe and flung her arms about\r\nhis massive neck. Scowling down into her upturned, beautiful countenance\r\nhe was aware of a fearful fascination and an icy fear.\r\n\r\n'Love me!' she whispered, her head thrown back, eyes closed and lips\r\nparted. 'Give me of your blood to renew my youth and perpetuate my\r\neverlasting life! I will make you, too, immortal! I will teach you the\r\nwisdom of all the ages, all the secrets that have lasted out the eons in\r\nthe blackness beneath these dark temples. I will make you king of that\r\nshadowy horde which revels among the tombs of the ancients when night\r\nveils the desert and bats flit across the moon. I am weary of priests\r\nand magicians, and captive girls dragged screaming through the portals\r\nof death. I desire a man. Love me, barbarian!'\r\n\r\nShe pressed her dark head down against his mighty breast, and he felt a\r\nsharp pang at the base of his throat. With a curse he tore her away and\r\nflung her sprawling across the couch.\r\n\r\n'Damned vampire!' Blood was trickling from a tiny wound in his throat.\r\n\r\nShe reared up on the couch like a serpent poised to strike, all the\r\ngolden fires of hell blazing in her wide eyes. Her lips drew back,\r\nrevealing white pointed teeth.\r\n\r\n'Fool!' she shrieked. 'Do you think to escape me? You will live and die\r\nin darkness! I have brought you far below the temple. You can never find\r\nyour way out alone. You can never cut your way through those which guard\r\nthe tunnels. But for my protection the sons of Set would long ago have\r\ntaken you into their bellies. Fool, I shall yet drink your blood!'\r\n\r\n'Keep away from me or I'll slash you asunder,' he grunted, his flesh\r\ncrawling with revulsion. 'You may be immortal, but steel will dismember\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\nAs he backed toward the arch through which he had entered, the light\r\nwent out suddenly. All the candles were extinguished at once, though he\r\ndid not know how; for Akivasha had not touched them. But the vampire's\r\nlaugh rose mockingly behind him, poison-sweet as the viols of hell, and\r\nhe sweated as he groped in the darkness for the arch in a near-panic.\r\nHis fingers encountered an opening and he plunged through it. Whether it\r\nwas the arch through which he had entered he did not know, nor did he\r\nvery much care. His one thought was to get out of the haunted chamber\r\nwhich had housed that beautiful, hideous, undead fiend for so many\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nHis wanderings through those black, winding tunnels were a sweating\r\nnightmare. Behind him and about him he heard faint slitherings and\r\nglidings, and once the echo of that sweet, hellish laughter he had heard\r\nin the chamber of Akivasha. He slashed ferociously at sounds and\r\nmovements he heard or imagined he heard in the darkness near him, and\r\nonce his sword cut through some yielding tenuous substance that might\r\nhave been cobwebs. He had a desperate feeling that he was being played\r\nwith, lured deeper and deeper into ultimate night, before being set upon\r\nby demoniac talon and fang.\r\n\r\nAnd through his fear ran the sickening revulsion of his discovery. The\r\nlegend of Akivasha was so old, and among the evil tales told of her ran\r\na thread of beauty and idealism, of everlasting youth. To so many\r\ndreamers and poets and lovers she was not alone the evil princess of\r\nStygian legend, but the symbol of eternal youth and beauty, shining for\r\never in some far realm of the gods. And this was the hideous reality.\r\nThis foul perversion was the truth of that everlasting life. Through his\r\nphysical revulsion ran the sense of a shattered dream of man's idolatry,\r\nits glittering gold proved slime and cosmic filth. A wave of futility\r\nswept over him, a dim fear of the falseness of all men's dreams and\r\nidolatries.\r\n\r\nAnd now he knew that his ears were not playing him tricks. He was being\r\nfollowed, and his pursuers were closing in on him. In the darkness\r\nsounded shufflings and slidings that were never made by human feet; no,\r\nnor by the feet of any normal animal. The underworld had its bestial\r\nlife too, perhaps. They were behind him. He turned to face them, though\r\nhe could see nothing, and slowly backed away. Then the sounds ceased,\r\neven before he turned his head and saw, somewhere down the long\r\ncorridor, a glow of light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\nIn the Hall of the Dead\r\n\r\n\r\nConan moved cautiously in the direction of the light he had seen, his\r\near cocked over his shoulder, but there was no further sound of pursuit,\r\nthough he _felt_ the darkness pregnant with sentient life.\r\n\r\nThe glow was not stationary; it moved, bobbing grotesquely along. Then\r\nhe saw the source. The tunnel he was traversing crossed another, wider\r\ncorridor some distance ahead of him. And along this latter tunnel filed\r\na bizarre procession--four tall, gaunt men in black, hooded robes,\r\nleaning on staffs. The leader held a torch above his head--a torch that\r\nburned with a curious steady glow. Like phantoms they passed across his\r\nlimited range of vision and vanished, with only a fading glow to tell of\r\ntheir passing. Their appearance was indescribably eldritch. They were\r\nnot Stygians, not like anything Conan had ever seen. He doubted if they\r\nwere even humans. They were like black ghosts, stalking ghoulishly along\r\nthe haunted tunnels.\r\n\r\nBut his position could be no more desperate than it was. Before the\r\ninhuman feet behind him could resume their slithering advance at the\r\nfading of the distant illumination, Conan was running down the corridor.\r\nHe plunged into the other tunnel and saw, far down it, small in the\r\ndistance, the weird procession moving in the glowing sphere. He stole\r\nnoiselessly after them, then shrank suddenly back against the wall as he\r\nsaw them halt and cluster together as if conferring on some matter. They\r\nturned as if to retrace their steps, and he slipped into the nearest\r\narchway. Groping in the darkness to which he had become so accustomed\r\nthat he could all but see through it, he discovered that the tunnel did\r\nnot run straight, but meandered, and he fell back beyond the first turn,\r\nso that the light of the strangers should not fall on him as they\r\npassed.\r\n\r\nBut as he stood there, he was aware of a low hum of sound from somewhere\r\nbehind him, like the murmur of human voices. Moving down the corridor in\r\nthat direction, he confirmed his first suspicion. Abandoning his\r\noriginal intention of following the ghoulish travelers to whatever\r\ndestination might be theirs, he set out in the direction of the voices.\r\n\r\nPresently he saw a glint of light ahead of him, and turning into the\r\ncorridor from which it issued, saw a broad arch filled with a dim glow\r\nat the other end. On his left a narrow stone stair went upward, and\r\ninstinctive caution prompted him to turn and mount the stair. The voices\r\nhe heard were coming from beyond that flame-filled arch.\r\n\r\nThe sounds fell away beneath him as he climbed, and presently he came\r\nout through a low arched door into a vast open space glowing with a\r\nweird radiance.\r\n\r\nHe was standing on a shadowy gallery from which he looked down into a\r\nbroad dim-lit hall of colossal proportions. It was a hall of the dead,\r\nwhich few ever see but the silent priests of Stygia. Along the black\r\nwalls rose tier above tier of carven, painted sarcophagi. Each stood in\r\na niche in the dusky stone, and the tiers mounted up and up to be lost\r\nin the gloom above. Thousands of carven masks stared impassively down\r\nupon the group in the midst of the hall, rendered futile and\r\ninsignificant by that vast array of the dead.\r\n\r\nOf this group ten were priests, and though they had discarded their\r\nmasks Conan knew they were the priests he had accompanied to the\r\npyramid. They stood before a tall, hawk-faced man beside a black altar\r\non which lay a mummy in rotting swathings. And the altar seemed to stand\r\nin the heart of a living fire which pulsed and shimmered, dripping\r\nflakes of quivering golden flame on the black stones about it. This\r\ndazzling glow emanated from a great red jewel which lay upon the altar,\r\nand in the reflection of which the faces of the priests looked ashy and\r\ncorpse-like. As he looked, Conan felt the pressure of all the weary\r\nleagues and the weary nights and days of his long quest, and he trembled\r\nwith the mad urge to rush among those silent priests, clear his way with\r\nmighty blows of naked steel, and grasp the red gem with passion-taut\r\nfingers. But he gripped himself with iron control, and crouched down in\r\nthe shadow of the stone balustrade. A glance showed him that a stair led\r\ndown into the hall from the gallery, hugging the wall and half hidden in\r\nthe shadows. He glared into the dimness of the vast place, seeking other\r\npriests or votaries, but saw only the group about the altar.\r\n\r\nIn that great emptiness the voice of the man beside the altar sounded\r\nhollow and ghostly:\r\n\r\n'... And so the word came southward. The night wind whispered it, the\r\nravens croaked of it as they flew, and the grim bats told it to the owls\r\nand the serpents that lurk in hoary ruins. Werewolf and vampire knew,\r\nand the ebon-bodied demons that prowl by night. The sleeping Night of\r\nthe World stirred and shook its heavy mane, and there began a throbbing\r\nof drums in deep darkness, and the echoes of far weird cries frightened\r\nmen who walked by dusk. For the Heart of Ahriman had come again into the\r\nworld to fulfill its cryptic destiny.\r\n\r\n'Ask me not how I, Thutothmes of Khemi and the Night, heard the word\r\nbefore Thoth-Amon who calls himself prince of all wizards. There are\r\nsecrets not meet for such ears even as yours, and Thoth-Amon is not the\r\nonly lord of the Black Ring.\r\n\r\n'I knew, and I went to meet the Heart which came southward. It was like\r\na magnet which drew me, unerringly. From death to death it came, riding\r\non a river of human blood. Blood feeds it, blood draws it. Its power is\r\ngreatest when there is blood on the hands that grasp it, when it is\r\nwrested by slaughter from its holder. Wherever it gleams, blood is spilt\r\nand kingdoms totter, and the forces of nature are put in turmoil.\r\n\r\n'And here I stand, the master of the Heart, and have summoned you to\r\ncome secretly, who are faithful to me, to share in the black kingdom\r\nthat shall be. Tonight you shall witness the breaking of Thoth-Amon's\r\nchains which enslave us, and the birth of empire.\r\n\r\n'Who am I, even I, Thutothmes, to know what powers lurk and dream in\r\nthose crimson deeps? It holds secrets forgotten for three thousand\r\nyears. But I shall learn. These shall tell me!'\r\n\r\nHe waved his hand toward the silent shapes that lined the hall.\r\n\r\n'See how they sleep, staring through their carven masks! Kings, queens,\r\ngenerals, priests, wizards, the dynasties and the nobility of Stygia for\r\nten thousand years! The touch of the heart will awaken them from their\r\nlong slumber. Long, long the Heart throbbed and pulsed in ancient\r\nStygia. Here was its home in the centuries before it journeyed to\r\nAcheron. The ancients knew its full power, and they will tell me when by\r\nits magic I restore them to life to labor for me.\r\n\r\n'I will rouse them, will waken them, will learn their forgotten wisdom,\r\nthe knowledge locked in those withered skulls. By the lore of the dead\r\nwe shall enslave the living! Aye, kings and generals and wizards of old\r\nshall be our helpers and our slaves. Who shall stand before us?\r\n\r\n'Look! This dried, shriveled thing on the altar was once Thothmekri, a\r\nhigh priest of Set, who died three thousand years ago. He was an adept\r\nof the Black Ring. He knew of the Heart. He will tell us of its powers.'\r\n\r\nLifting the great jewel, the speaker laid it on the withered breast of\r\nthe mummy, and lifted his hand as he began an incantation. But the\r\nincantation was never finished. With his hand lifted and his lips parted\r\nhe froze, glaring past his acolytes, and they wheeled to stare in the\r\ndirection in which he was looking.\r\n\r\nThrough the black arch of a door four gaunt, black-robed shapes had\r\nfiled into the great hall. Their faces were dim yellow ovals in the\r\nshadow of their hoods.\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' ejaculated Thutothmes in a voice as pregnant with danger\r\nas the hiss of a cobra. 'Are you mad, to invade the holy shrine of Set?'\r\n\r\nThe tallest of the strangers spoke, and his voice was toneless as a\r\nKhitan temple bell.\r\n\r\n'We follow Conan of Aquilonia.'\r\n\r\n'He is not here,' answered Thutothmes, shaking back his mantle from his\r\nright hand with a curious menacing gesture, like a panther unsheathing\r\nhis talons.\r\n\r\n'You lie. He is in this temple. We tracked him from a corpse behind the\r\nbronze door of the outer portal through a maze of corridors. We were\r\nfollowing his devious trail when we became aware of this conclave. We go\r\nnow to take it up again. But first give us the Heart of Ahriman.'\r\n\r\n'Death is the portion of madmen,' murmured Thutothmes, moving nearer the\r\nspeaker. His priests closed in on cat-like feet, but the strangers did\r\nnot appear to heed.\r\n\r\n'Who can look upon it without desire?' said the Khitan. 'In Khitai we\r\nhave heard of it. It will give us power over the people which cast us\r\nout. Glory and wonder dream in its crimson deeps. Give it to us, before\r\nwe slay you.'\r\n\r\nA fierce cry rang out as a priest leaped with a flicker of steel. Before\r\nhe could strike, a scaly staff licked out and touched his breast, and he\r\nfell as a dead man falls. In an instant the mummies were staring down on\r\na scene of blood and horror. Curved knives flashed and crimsoned, snaky\r\nstaffs licked in and out, and whenever they touched a man, that man\r\nscreamed and died.\r\n\r\nAt the first stroke Conan had bounded up and was racing down the stairs.\r\nHe caught only glimpses of that brief, fiendish fight--saw men swaying,\r\nlocked in battle and streaming blood; saw one Khitan, fairly hacked to\r\npieces, yet still on his feet and dealing death, when Thutothmes smote\r\nhim on the breast with his open empty hand, and he dropped dead, though\r\nnaked steel had not been enough to destroy his uncanny vitality.\r\n\r\nBy the time Conan's hurtling feet left the stair, the fight was all but\r\nover. Three of the Khitans were down, slashed and cut to ribbons and\r\ndisemboweled, but of the Stygians only Thutothmes remained on his feet.\r\n\r\nHe rushed at the remaining Khitan, his empty hand lifted like a weapon,\r\nand that hand was black as that of a negro. But before he could strike,\r\nthe staff in the tall Khitan's hand licked out, seeming to elongate\r\nitself as the yellow man thrust. The point touched the bosom of\r\nThutothmes and he staggered; again and yet again the staff licked out,\r\nand Thutothmes reeled and fell dead, his features blotted out in a rush\r\nof blackness that made the whole of him the same hue as his enchanted\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe Khitan turned toward the jewel that burned on the breast of the\r\nmummy, but Conan was before him.\r\n\r\nIn a tense stillness the two faced each other, amid that shambles, with\r\nthe carven mummies staring down upon them.\r\n\r\n'Far have I followed you, oh king of Aquilonia,' said the Khitan calmly.\r\n'Down the long river, and over the mountains, across Poitain and Zingara\r\nand through the hills of Argos and down the coast. Not easily did we\r\npick up your trail from Tarantia, for the priests of Asura are crafty.\r\nWe lost it in Zingara, but we found your helmet in the forest below the\r\nborder hills, where you had fought with the ghouls of the forests.\r\nAlmost we lost the trail again tonight among these labyrinths.'\r\n\r\nConan reflected that he had been fortunate in returning from the\r\nvampire's chamber by another route than that by which he had been led to\r\nit. Otherwise he would have run full into these yellow fiends instead\r\nof sighting them from afar as they smelled out his spoor like human\r\nbloodhounds, with whatever uncanny gift was theirs.\r\n\r\nThe Khitan shook his head slightly, as if reading his mind.\r\n\r\n'That is meaningless; the long trail ends here.'\r\n\r\n'Why have you hounded me?' demanded Conan, poised to move in any\r\ndirection with the celerity of a hair-trigger.\r\n\r\n'It was a debt to pay,' answered the Khitan. 'To you who are about to\r\ndie, I will not withhold knowledge. We were vassals of the king of\r\nAquilonia, Valerius. Long we served him, but of that service we are free\r\nnow--my brothers by death, and I by the fulfilment of obligation. I\r\nshall return to Aquilonia with two hearts; for myself the Heart of\r\nAhriman; for Valerius the heart of Conan. A kiss of the staff that was\r\ncut from the living Tree of Death--'\r\n\r\nThe staff licked out like the dart of a viper, but the slash of Conan's\r\nknife was quicker. The staff fell in writhing halves, there was another\r\nflicker of the keen steel like a jet of lightning, and the head of the\r\nKhitan rolled to the floor.\r\n\r\nConan wheeled and extended his hand toward the jewel--then he shrank\r\nback, his hair bristling, his blood congealing icily.\r\n\r\nFor no longer a withered brown thing lay on the altar. The jewel\r\nshimmered on the full, arching breast of a naked, living man who lay\r\namong the moldering bandages. Living? Conan could not decide. The eyes\r\nwere like dark murky glass under which shone inhuman somber fires.\r\n\r\nSlowly the man rose, taking the jewel in his hand. He towered beside the\r\naltar, dusky, naked, with a face like a carven image. Mutely he extended\r\nhis hand toward Conan, with the jewel throbbing like a living heart\r\nwithin it. Conan took it, with an eery sensation of receiving gifts from\r\nthe hand of the dead. He somehow realized that the proper incantations\r\nhad not been made--the conjurement had not been completed--life had not\r\nbeen fully restored to his corpse.\r\n\r\n'Who are you?' demanded the Cimmerian.\r\n\r\nThe answer came in a toneless monotone, like the dripping of water from\r\nstalactites in subterranean caverns. 'I was Thothmekri; I am dead.'\r\n\r\n'Well, lead me out of this accursed temple, will you?' Conan requested,\r\nhis flesh crawling.\r\n\r\nWith measured, mechanical steps the dead man moved toward a black arch.\r\nConan followed him. A glance back showed him once again the vast,\r\nshadowy hall with its tiers of sarcophagi, the dead men sprawled about\r\nthe altar; the head of the Khitan he had slain stared sightless up at\r\nthe sweeping shadows.\r\n\r\nThe glow of the jewel illuminated the black tunnels like an ensorceled\r\nlamp, dripping golden fire. Once Conan caught a glimpse of ivory flesh\r\nin the shadows, believed he saw the vampire that was Akivasha shrinking\r\nback from the glow of the jewel; and with her, other less human shapes\r\nscuttled or shambled into the darkness.\r\n\r\nThe dead man strode straight on, looking neither to right nor left, his\r\npace as changeless as the tramp of doom. Cold sweat gathered thick on\r\nConan's flesh. Icy doubts assailed him. How could he know that this\r\nterrible figure out of the past was leading him to freedom? But he knew\r\nthat, left to himself, he could never untangle this bewitched maze of\r\ncorridors and tunnels. He followed his awful guide through blackness\r\nthat loomed before and behind them and was filled with skulking shapes\r\nof horror and lunacy that cringed from the blinding glow of the Heart.\r\n\r\nThen the bronze doorway was before him, and Conan felt the night wind\r\nblowing across the desert, and saw the stars, and the starlit desert\r\nacross which streamed the great black shadow of the pyramid. Thothmekri\r\npointed silently into the desert, and then turned and stalked\r\nsoundlessly back in the darkness. Conan stared after that silent figure\r\nthat receded into the blackness on soundless, inexorable feet as one\r\nthat moves to a known and inevitable doom, or returns to everlasting\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nWith a curse the Cimmerian leaped from the doorway and fled into the\r\ndesert as if pursued by demons. He did not look back toward the pyramid,\r\nor toward the black towers of Khemi looming dimly across the sands. He\r\nheaded southward toward the coast, and he ran as a man runs in\r\nungovernable panic. The violent exertion shook his brain free of black\r\ncobwebs; the clean desert wind blew the nightmares from his soul and his\r\nrevulsion changed to a wild tide of exultation before the desert gave\r\nway to a tangle of swampy growth through which he saw the black water\r\nlying before him, and the _Venturer_ at anchor.\r\n\r\nHe plunged through the undergrowth, hip-deep in the marshes; dived\r\nheadlong into the deep water, heedless of sharks or crocodiles, and swam\r\nto the galley and was clambering up the chain on to the deck, dripping\r\nand exultant, before the watch saw him.\r\n\r\n'Awake, you dogs!' roared Conan, knocking aside the spear the startled\r\nlookout thrust at his breast. 'Heave up the anchor! Lay to the doors!\r\nGive that fisherman a helmet full of gold and put him ashore! Dawn will\r\nsoon be breaking, and before sunrise we must be racing for the nearest\r\nport of Zingara!'\r\n\r\nHe whirled about his head the great jewel, which threw off splashes of\r\nlight that spotted the deck with golden fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nOut of the Dust Shall Acheron Arise\r\n\r\n\r\nWinter had passed from Aquilonia. Leaves sprang out on the limbs of\r\ntrees, and the fresh grass smiled to the touch of the warm southern\r\nbreezes. But many a field lay idle and empty, many a charred heap of\r\nashes marked the spot where proud villas or prosperous towns had stood.\r\nWolves prowled openly along the grass-grown highways, and bands of\r\ngaunt, masterless men slunk through the forests. Only in Tarantia was\r\nfeasting and wealth and pageantry.\r\n\r\nValerius ruled like one touched with madness. Even many of the barons\r\nwho had welcomed his return cried out at last against him. His\r\ntax-gatherers crushed rich and poor alike; the wealth of a looted\r\nkingdom poured into Tarantia, which became less like the capital of a\r\nrealm than the garrison of conquerors in a conquered land. Its merchants\r\nwaxed rich, but it was a precarious prosperity; for none knew when he\r\nmight be accused of treason on a trumped-up charge, and his property\r\nconfiscated, himself cast into prison or brought to the bloody block.\r\n\r\nValerius made no attempt to conciliate his subjects. He maintained\r\nhimself by means of the Nemedian soldiery and by desperate mercenaries.\r\nHe knew himself to be a puppet of Amalric. He knew that he ruled only on\r\nthe sufferance of the Nemedian. He knew that he could never hope to\r\nunite Aquilonia under his rule and cast off the yoke of his masters, for\r\nthe outland provinces would resist him to the last drop of blood. And\r\nfor that matter the Nemedians would cast him from his throne if he made\r\nany attempt to consolidate his kingdom. He was caught in his own vise.\r\nThe gall of defeated pride corroded his soul, and he threw himself into\r\na reign of debauchery, as one who lives from day to day, without thought\r\nor care for tomorrow.\r\n\r\nYet there was subtlety in his madness, so deep that not even Amalric\r\nguessed it. Perhaps the wild, chaotic years of wandering as an exile had\r\nbred in him a bitterness beyond common conception. Perhaps his loathing\r\nof his present position increased this bitterness to a kind of madness.\r\nAt any event he lived with one desire: to cause the ruin of all who\r\nassociated with him.\r\n\r\nHe knew that his rule would be over the instant he had served Amalric's\r\npurpose; he knew, too, that so long as he continued to oppress his\r\nnative kingdom the Nemedian would suffer him to reign, for Amalric\r\nwished to crush Aquilonia into ultimate submission, to destroy its last\r\nshred of independence, and then at last to seize it himself, rebuild it\r\nafter his own fashion with his vast wealth, and use its men and natural\r\nresources to wrest the crown of Nemedia from Tarascus. For the throne of\r\nan emperor was Amalric's ultimate ambition, and Valerius knew it.\r\nValerius did not know whether Tarascus suspected this, but he knew that\r\nthe king of Nemedia approved of his ruthless course. Tarascus hated\r\nAquilonia, with a hate born of old wars. He desired only the destruction\r\nof the western kingdom.\r\n\r\nAnd Valerius intended to ruin the country so utterly that not even\r\nAmalric's wealth could ever rebuild it. He hated the baron quite as much\r\nas he hated the Aquilonians, and hoped only to live to see the day when\r\nAquilonia lay in utter ruin, and Tarascus and Amalric were locked in\r\nhopeless civil war that would as completely destroy Nemedia.\r\n\r\nHe believed that the conquest of the still defiant provinces of\r\nGunderland and Poitain and the Bossonian marches would mark his end as\r\nking. He would then have served Amalric's purpose, and could be\r\ndiscarded. So he delayed the conquest of these provinces, confining his\r\nactivities to objectless raids and forays, meeting Amalric's urges for\r\naction with all sorts of plausible objections and postponements.\r\n\r\nHis life was a series of feasts and wild debauches. He filled his palace\r\nwith the fairest girls of the kingdom, willing or unwilling. He\r\nblasphemed the gods and sprawled drunken on the floor of the banquet\r\nhall wearing the golden crown, and staining his royal purple robes with\r\nthe wine he spilled. In gusts of blood-lust he festooned the gallows in\r\nthe market square with dangling corpses, glutted the axes of the\r\nheadsmen and sent his Nemedian horsemen thundering through the land\r\npillaging and burning. Driven to madness, the land was in a constant\r\nupheaval of frantic revolt, savagely suppressed. Valerius plundered and\r\nraped and looted and destroyed until even Amalric protested, warning him\r\nthat he would beggar the kingdom beyond repair, not knowing that such\r\nwas his fixed determination.\r\n\r\nBut while in both Aquilonia and Nemedia men talked of the madness of the\r\nking, in Nemedia men talked much of Xaltotun, the masked one. Yet few\r\nsaw him on the streets of Belverus. Men said he spent much time in the\r\nhills, in curious conclaves with surviving remnants of an old race:\r\ndark, silent folk who claimed descent from an ancient kingdom. Men\r\nwhispered of drums beating far up in the dreaming hills, of fires\r\nglowing in the darkness, and strange chantings borne on the winds,\r\nchantings and rituals forgotten centuries ago except as meaningless\r\nformulas mumbled beside mountain hearths in villages whose inhabitants\r\ndiffered strangely from the people of the valleys.\r\n\r\nThe reason for these conclaves none knew, unless it was Orastes, who\r\nfrequently accompanied the Pythonian, and on whose countenance a haggard\r\nshadow was growing.\r\n\r\nBut in the full flood of spring a sudden whisper passed over the sinking\r\nkingdom that woke the land to eager life. It came like a murmurous wind\r\ndrifting up from the south, waking men sunk in the apathy of despair.\r\nYet how it first came none could truly say. Some spoke of a strange,\r\ngrim old woman who came down from the mountains with her hair flowing in\r\nthe wind, and a great gray wolf following her like a dog. Others\r\nwhispered of the priests of Asura who stole like furtive phantoms from\r\nGunderland to the marches of Poitain, and to the forest villages of the\r\nBossonians.\r\n\r\nHowever the word came, revolt ran like a flame along the borders.\r\nOutlying Nemedian garrisons were stormed and put to the sword, foraging\r\nparties were cut to pieces; the west was up in arms, and there was a\r\ndifferent air about the rising, a fierce resolution and inspired wrath\r\nrather than the frantic despair that had motivated the preceding\r\nrevolts. It was not only the common people; barons were fortifying their\r\ncastles and hurling defiance at the governors of the provinces. Bands of\r\nBossonians were seen moving along the edges of the marches: stocky,\r\nresolute men in brigandines and steel caps, with longbows in their\r\nhands. From the inert stagnation of dissolution and ruin the realm was\r\nsuddenly alive, vibrant and dangerous. So Amalric sent in haste for\r\nTarascus, who came with an army.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the royal palace in Tarantia the two kings and Amalric discussed the\r\nrising. They had not sent for Xaltotun, immersed in his cryptic studies\r\nin the Nemedian hills. Not since that bloody day in the valley of the\r\nValkia had they called upon him for aid of his magic, and he had drawn\r\napart, communing but little with them, apparently indifferent to their\r\nintrigues.\r\n\r\nNor had they sent for Orastes, but he came, and he was white as spume\r\nblown before the storm. He stood in the gold-domed chamber where the\r\nkings held conclave and they beheld in amazement his haggard stare, the\r\nfear they had never guessed the mind of Orastes could hold.\r\n\r\n'You are weary, Orastes,' said Amalric. 'Sit upon this divan and I will\r\nhave a slave fetch you wine. You have ridden hard--'\r\n\r\nOrastes waved aside the invitation.\r\n\r\n'I have killed three horses on the road from Belverus. I cannot drink\r\nwine, I cannot rest, until I have said what I have to say.'\r\n\r\nHe paced back and forth as if some inner fire would not let him stand\r\nmotionless, and halting before his wondering companions:\r\n\r\n'When we employed the Heart of Ahriman to bring a dead man back to\r\nlife,' Orastes said abruptly, 'we did not weigh the consequences of\r\ntampering in the black dust of the past. The fault is mine, and the sin.\r\nWe thought only of our ambitions, forgetting what ambitions this man\r\nmight himself have. And we have loosed a demon upon the earth, a fiend\r\ninexplicable to common humanity. I have plumbed deep in evil, but there\r\nis a limit to which I, or any man of my race and age, can go. My\r\nancestors were clean men, without any demoniacal taint; it is only I who\r\nhave sunk into the pits, and I can sin only to the extent of my personal\r\nindividuality. But behind Xaltotun lie a thousand centuries of black\r\nmagic and diabolism, an ancient tradition of evil. He is beyond our\r\nconception not only because he is a wizard himself, but also because he\r\nis the son of a race of wizards.\r\n\r\n'I have seen things that have blasted my soul. In the heart of the\r\nslumbering hills I have watched Xaltotun commune with the souls of the\r\ndamned, and invoke the ancient demons of forgotten Acheron. I have seen\r\nthe accursed descendants of that accursed empire worship him and hail\r\nhim as their arch-priest. I have seen what he plots--and I tell you it\r\nis no less than the restoration of the ancient, black, grisly kingdom of\r\nAcheron!'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' demanded Amalric. 'Acheron is dust. There are not\r\nenough survivals to make an empire. Not even Xaltotun can reshape the\r\ndust of three thousand years.'\r\n\r\n'You know little of his black powers,' answered Orastes grimly. 'I have\r\nseen the very hills take on an alien and ancient aspect under the spell\r\nof his incantations. I have glimpsed, like shadows behind the realities,\r\nthe dim shapes and outlines of valleys, forests, mountains and lakes\r\nthat are not as they are today, but as they were in that dim\r\nyesterday--have even sensed, rather than glimpsed, the purple towers of\r\nforgotten Python shimmering like figures of mist in the dusk.\r\n\r\n'And in the last conclave to which I accompanied him, understanding of\r\nhis sorcery came to me at last, while the drums beat and the beast-like\r\nworshippers howled with their heads in the dust. I tell you he would\r\nrestore Acheron by his magic, by the sorcery of a gigantic\r\nblood-sacrifice such as the world has never seen. He would enslave the\r\nworld, and with a deluge of blood _wash away the present and restore the\r\npast_!'\r\n\r\n'You are mad!' exclaimed Tarascus.\r\n\r\n'Mad?' Orastes turned a haggard stare upon him. 'Can any man see what I\r\nhave seen and remain wholly sane? Yet I speak the truth. He plots the\r\nreturn of Acheron, with its towers and wizards and kings and horrors, as\r\nit was in the long ago. The descendants of Acheron will serve him as a\r\nnucleus upon which to build, but it is the blood and the bodies of the\r\npeople of the world today that will furnish the mortar and the stones\r\nfor the rebuilding. I cannot tell you how. My own brain reels when I try\r\nto understand. _But I have seen!_ Acheron will be Acheron again, and\r\neven the hills, the forests and the rivers will resume their ancient\r\naspect. Why not? If I, with my tiny store of knowledge, could bring to\r\nlife a man dead three thousand years, why cannot the greatest wizard of\r\nthe world bring back to life a kingdom dead three thousand years? Out of\r\nthe dust shall Acheron arise at his bidding.'\r\n\r\n'How can we thwart him?' asked Tarascus, impressed.\r\n\r\n'There is but one way,' answered Orastes. 'We must steal the Heart of\r\nAhriman!'\r\n\r\n'But I--' began Tarascus involuntarily, then closed his mouth quickly.\r\n\r\nNone had noticed him, and Orastes was continuing.\r\n\r\n'It is a power that can be used against him. With it in my hands I might\r\ndefy him. But how shall we steal it? He has it hidden in some secret\r\nplace, from which not even a Zamorian thief might filch it. I cannot\r\nlearn its hiding-place. If he would only sleep again the sleep of the\r\nblack lotus--but the last time he slept thus was after the battle of the\r\nValkia, when he was weary because of the great magic he had performed,\r\nand--'\r\n\r\nThe door was locked and bolted, but it swung silently open and Xaltotun\r\nstood before them, calm, tranquil, stroking his patriarchal beard; but\r\nthe lambent lights of hell flickered in his eyes.\r\n\r\n'I have taught you too much,' he said calmly, pointing a finger like an\r\nindex of doom at Orastes. And before any could move, he had cast a\r\nhandful of dust on the floor near the feet of the priest, who stood like\r\na man turned to marble. It flamed, smoldered; a blue serpentine of smoke\r\nrose and swayed upward about Orastes in a slender spiral. And when it\r\nhad risen above his shoulders it curled about his neck with a whipping\r\nsuddenness like the stroke of a snake. Orastes' scream was choked to a\r\ngurgle. His hands flew to his neck, his eyes were distended, his tongue\r\nprotruded. The smoke was like a blue rope about his neck; then it faded\r\nand was gone, and Orastes slumped to the floor a dead man.\r\n\r\nXaltotun smote his hands together and two men entered, men often\r\nobserved accompanying him--small, repulsively dark, with red, oblique\r\neyes and pointed, rat-like teeth. They did not speak. Lifting the\r\ncorpse, they bore it away.\r\n\r\nDismissing the matter with a wave of his hand, Xaltotun seated himself\r\nat the ivory table about which sat the pale kings.\r\n\r\n'Why are you in conclave?' he demanded.\r\n\r\n'The Aquilonians have risen in the west,' answered Amalric, recovering\r\nfrom the grisly jolt the death of Orastes had given him. 'The fools\r\nbelieve that Conan is alive, and coming at the head of a Poitanian army\r\nto reclaim his kingdom. If he had reappeared immediately after Valkia,\r\nor if a rumor had been circulated that he lived, the central provinces\r\nwould not have risen under him, they feared your powers so. But they\r\nhave become so desperate under Valerius' misrule that they are ready to\r\nfollow any man who can unite them against us, and prefer sudden death to\r\ntorture and continual misery.\r\n\r\n'Of course the tale has lingered stubbornly in the land that Conan was\r\nnot really slain at Valkia, but not until recently have the masses\r\naccepted it. But Pallantides is back from exile in Ophir, swearing that\r\nthe king was ill in his tent that day, and that a man-at-arms wore his\r\nharness, and a squire who but recently recovered from the stroke of a\r\nmace received at Valkia confirms his tale--or pretends to.\r\n\r\n'An old woman with a pet wolf has wandered up and down the land,\r\nproclaiming that King Conan yet lives, and will return some day to\r\nreclaim the crown. And of late the cursed priests of Asura sing the same\r\nsong. They claim that word has come to them by some mysterious means\r\nthat Conan is returning to reconquer his domain. I cannot catch either\r\nher or them. This is, of course, a trick of Trocero's. My spies tell me\r\nthere is indisputable evidence that the Poitanians are gathering to\r\ninvade Aquilonia. I believe that Trocero will bring forward some\r\npretender who he will claim is King Conan.'\r\n\r\nTarascus laughed, but there was no conviction in his laughter. He\r\nsurreptitiously felt of a scar beneath his jupon, and remembered ravens\r\nthat cawed on the trail of a fugitive; remembered the body of his\r\nsquire, Arideus, brought back from the border mountains horribly\r\nmangled, by a great gray wolf, his terrified soldiers said. But he also\r\nremembered a red jewel stolen from a golden chest while a wizard slept,\r\nand he said nothing.\r\n\r\nAnd Valerius remembered a dying nobleman who gasped out a tale of fear,\r\nand he remembered four Khitans who disappeared into the mazes of the\r\nsouth and never returned. But he held his tongue, for hatred and\r\nsuspicion of his allies ate at him like a worm, and he desired nothing\r\nso much as to see both rebels and Nemedians go down locked in the death\r\ngrip.\r\n\r\nBut Amalric exclaimed: 'It is absurd to dream that Conan lives!'\r\n\r\nFor answer Xaltotun cast a roll of parchment on the table.\r\n\r\nAmalric caught it up, glared at it. From his lips burst a furious,\r\nincoherent cry. He read:\r\n\r\n     _To Xaltotun, grand fakir of Nemedia: Dog of Acheron, I am\r\n     returning to my kingdom, and I mean to hang your hide on a\r\n     bramble._\r\n\r\n     Conan\r\n\r\n'A forgery!' exclaimed Amalric.\r\n\r\nXaltotun shook his head.\r\n\r\n'It is genuine. I have compared it with the signature on the royal\r\ndocuments on record in the libraries of the court. None could imitate\r\nthat bold scrawl.'\r\n\r\n'Then if Conan lives,' muttered Amalric, 'this uprising will not be like\r\nthe others, for he is the only man living who can unite the Aquilonians.\r\nBut,' he protested, 'this is not like Conan. Why should he put us on our\r\nguard with his boasting? One would think that he would strike without\r\nwarning, after the fashion of the barbarians.'\r\n\r\n'We are already warned,' pointed out Xaltotun. 'Our spies have told us\r\nof preparations for war in Poitain. He could not cross the mountains\r\nwithout our knowledge; so he sends me his defiance in characteristic\r\nmanner.'\r\n\r\n'Why to you?' demanded Valerius. 'Why not to me, or to Tarascus?'\r\n\r\nXaltotun turned his inscrutable gaze upon the king.\r\n\r\n'Conan is wiser than you,' he said at last. 'He already knows what you\r\nkings have yet to learn--that it is not Tarascus, nor Valerius, no, nor\r\nAmalric, but Xaltotun who is the real master of the western nations.'\r\n\r\nThey did not reply; they sat staring at him, assailed by a numbing\r\nrealization of the truth of his assertion.\r\n\r\n'There is no road for me but the imperial highway,' said Xaltotun. 'But\r\nfirst we must crush Conan. I do not know how he escaped me at Belverus,\r\nfor knowledge of what happened while I lay in the slumber of the black\r\nlotus is denied me. But he is in the south, gathering an army. It is his\r\nlast, desperate blow, made possible only by the desperation of the\r\npeople who have suffered under Valerius. Let them rise; I hold them all\r\nin the palm of my hand. We will wait until he moves against us, and then\r\nwe will crush him once and for all.\r\n\r\n'Then we shall crush Poitain and Gunderland and the stupid Bossonians.\r\nAfter them Ophir, Argos, Zingara, Koth--all the nations of the world we\r\nshall weld into one vast empire. You shall rule as my satraps, and as my\r\ncaptains shall be greater than kings are now. I am unconquerable, for\r\nthe Heart of Ahriman is hidden where no man can ever wield it against me\r\nagain.'\r\n\r\nTarascus averted his gaze, lest Xaltotun read his thoughts. He knew the\r\nwizard had not looked into the golden chest with its carven serpents\r\nthat had seemed to sleep, since he laid the Heart therein. Strange as it\r\nseemed, Xaltotun did not know that the heart had been stolen; the\r\nstrange jewel was beyond or outside the ring of his dark wisdom; his\r\nuncanny talents did not warn him that the chest was empty. Tarascus did\r\nnot believe that Xaltotun knew the full extent of Orastes' revelations,\r\nfor the Pythonian had not mentioned the restoration of Acheron, but only\r\nthe building of a new, earthly empire. Tarascus did not believe that\r\nXaltotun was yet quite sure of his power; if they needed his aid in\r\ntheir ambitions, no less he needed theirs. Magic depended, to a certain\r\nextent after all, on sword strokes and lance thrusts. The king read\r\nmeaning in Amalric's furtive glance; let the wizard use his arts to help\r\nthem defeat their most dangerous enemy. Time enough then to turn against\r\nhim. There might yet be a way to cheat this dark power they had raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\nDrums of Peril\r\n\r\n\r\nConfirmation of the war came when the army of Poitain, ten thousand\r\nstrong, marched through the southern passes with waving banners and\r\nshimmer of steel. And at their head, the spies swore, rode a giant\r\nfigure in black armor, with the royal lion of Aquilonia worked in gold\r\nupon the breast of his rich silken surcoat. Conan lived! The king lived!\r\nThere was no doubt of it in men's minds now, whether friend or foe.\r\n\r\nWith the news of the invasion from the south there also came word,\r\nbrought by hard-riding couriers, that a host of Gundermen was moving\r\nsouthward, reinforced by the barons of the northwest and the northern\r\nBossonians. Tarascus marched with thirty-one thousand men to Galparan,\r\non the river Shirki, which the Gundermen must cross to strike at the\r\ntowns still held by the Nemedians. The Shirki was a swift, turbulent\r\nriver rushing southwestward through rocky gorges and canyons, and there\r\nwere few places where an army could cross at that time of the year, when\r\nthe stream was almost bank-full with the melting of the snows. All the\r\ncountry east of the Shirki was in the hands of the Nemedians, and it was\r\nlogical to assume that the Gundermen would attempt to cross either at\r\nGalparan, or at Tanasul, which lay to the south of Galparan.\r\nReinforcements were daily expected from Nemedia, until word came that\r\nthe king of Ophir was making hostile demonstrations on Nemedia's\r\nsouthern border, and to spare any more troops would be to expose Nemedia\r\nto the risk of an invasion from the south.\r\n\r\nAmalric and Valerius moved out from Tarantia with twenty-five thousand\r\nmen, leaving as large a garrison as they dared to discourage revolts in\r\nthe cities during their absence. They wished to meet and crush Conan\r\nbefore he could be joined by the rebellious forces of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe king and his Poitanians had crossed the mountains, but there had\r\nbeen no actual clash of arms, no attack on towns or fortresses. Conan\r\nhad appeared and disappeared. Apparently he had turned westward through\r\nthe wild, thinly settled hill country, and entered the Bossonian\r\nmarches, gathering recruits as he went. Amalric and Valerius with their\r\nhost, Nemedians, Aquilonian renegades, and ferocious mercenaries, moved\r\nthrough the land in baffled wrath, looking for a foe which did not\r\nappear.\r\n\r\nAmalric found it impossible to obtain more than vague general tidings\r\nabout Conan's movements. Scouting-parties had a way of riding out and\r\nnever returning, and it was not uncommon to find a spy crucified to an\r\noak. The countryside was up and striking as peasants and country-folk\r\nstrike--savagely, murderously and secretly. All that Amalric knew\r\ncertainly was that a large force of Gundermen and northern Bossonians\r\nwas somewhere to the north of him, beyond the Shirki, and that Conan\r\nwith a smaller force of Poitanians and southern Bossonians was somewhere\r\nto the southwest of him.\r\n\r\nHe began to grow fearful that if he and Valerius advanced further into\r\nthe wild country, Conan might elude them entirely, march around them and\r\ninvade the central provinces behind them. Amalric fell back from the\r\nShirki valley and camped in a plain a day's ride from Tanasul. There he\r\nwaited. Tarascus maintained his position at Galparan, for he feared that\r\nConan's maneuvers were intended to draw him southward, and so let the\r\nGundermen into the kingdom at the northern crossing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo Amalric's camp came Xaltotun in his chariot drawn by the uncanny\r\nhorses that never tired, and he entered Amalric's tent where the baron\r\nconferred with Valerius over a map spread on an ivory camp table.\r\n\r\nThis map Xaltotun crumpled and flung aside.\r\n\r\n'What your scouts cannot learn for you,' quoth he, 'my spies tell me,\r\nthough their information is strangely blurred and imperfect, as if\r\nunseen forces were working against me.\r\n\r\n'Conan is advancing along the Shirki river with ten thousand Poitanians,\r\nthree thousand southern Bossonians, and barons of the west and south\r\nwith their retainers to the number of five thousand. An army of thirty\r\nthousand Gundermen and northern Bossonians is pushing southward to join\r\nhim. They have established contact by means of secret communications\r\nused by the cursed priests of Asura, who seem to be opposing me, and\r\nwhom I will feed to a serpent when the battle is over--I swear it by\r\nSet!\r\n\r\n'Both armies are headed for the crossing at Tanasul, but I do not\r\nbelieve that the Gundermen will cross the river. I believe that Conan\r\nwill cross, instead, and join them.'\r\n\r\n'Why should Conan cross the river?'\r\n\r\n'Because it is to his advantage to delay the battle. The longer he\r\nwaits, the stronger he will become, the more precarious our position.\r\nThe hills on the other side of the river swarm with people passionately\r\nloyal to his cause--broken men, refugees, fugitives from Valerius'\r\ncruelty. From all over the kingdom men are hurrying to join his army,\r\nsingly and by companies. Daily, parties from our armies are ambushed and\r\ncut to pieces by the country-folk. Revolt grows in the central\r\nprovinces, and will soon burst into open rebellion. The garrisons we\r\nleft there are not sufficient, and we can hope for no reinforcements\r\nfrom Nemedia for the time being. I see the hand of Pallantides in this\r\nbrawling on the Ophirean frontier. He has kin in Ophir.\r\n\r\n'If we do not catch and crush Conan quickly the provinces will be in a\r\nblaze of revolt behind us. We shall have to fall back to Tarantia to\r\ndefend what we have taken; and we may have to fight our way through a\r\ncountry in rebellion, with Conan's whole force at our heels, and then\r\nstand siege in the city itself, with enemies within as well as without.\r\nNo, we cannot wait. We must crush Conan before his army grows too great,\r\nbefore the central provinces rise. With his head hanging above the gate\r\nat Tarantia you will see how quickly the rebellion will fall apart.'\r\n\r\n'Why do you not put a spell on his army to slay them all?' asked\r\nValerius, half in mockery.\r\n\r\nXaltotun stared at the Aquilonian as if he read the full extent of the\r\nmocking madness that lurked in those wayward eyes.\r\n\r\n'Do not worry,' he said at last. 'My arts shall crush Conan finally like\r\na lizard under the heel. But even sorcery is aided by pikes and swords.'\r\n\r\n'If he crosses the river and takes up his position in the Goralian hills\r\nhe may be hard to dislodge,' said Amalric. 'But if we catch him in the\r\nvalley on this side of the river we can wipe him out. How far is Conan\r\nfrom Tanasul?'\r\n\r\n'At the rate he is marching he should reach the crossing sometime\r\ntomorrow night. His men are rugged and he is pushing them hard. He\r\nshould arrive there at least a day before the Gundermen.'\r\n\r\n'Good!' Amalric smote the table with his clenched fist. 'I can reach\r\nTanasul before he can. I'll send a rider to Tarascus, bidding him follow\r\nme to Tanasul. By the time he arrives I will have cut Conan off from the\r\ncrossing and destroyed him. Then our combined force can cross the river\r\nand deal with the Gundermen.'\r\n\r\nXaltotun shook his head impatiently.\r\n\r\n'A good enough plan if you were dealing with anyone but Conan. But your\r\ntwenty-five thousand men are not enough to destroy his eighteen thousand\r\nbefore the Gundermen come up. They will fight with the desperation of\r\nwounded panthers. And suppose the Gundermen come up while the hosts are\r\nlocked in battle? You will be caught between two fires and destroyed\r\nbefore Tarascus can arrive. He will reach Tanasul too late to aid you.'\r\n\r\n'What then?' demanded Amalric.\r\n\r\n'Move with your whole strength against Conan,' answered the man from\r\nAcheron. 'Send a rider bidding Tarascus join us here. We will wait his\r\ncoming. Then we will march together to Tanasul.'\r\n\r\n'But while we wait,' protested Amalric, 'Conan will cross the river and\r\njoin the Gundermen.'\r\n\r\n'Conan will not cross the river,' answered Xaltotun.\r\n\r\nAmalric's head jerked up and he stared into the cryptic dark eyes.\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?'\r\n\r\n'Suppose there were torrential rains far to the north, at the head of\r\nthe Shirki? Suppose the river came down in such flood as to render the\r\ncrossing at Tanasul impassable? Could we not then bring up our entire\r\nforce at our leisure, catch Conan on this side of the river and crush\r\nhim, and then, when the flood subsided, which I think it would do the\r\nnext day, could we not cross the river and destroy the Gundermen? Thus\r\nwe could use our full strength against each of these smaller forces in\r\nturn.'\r\n\r\nValerius laughed as he always laughed at the prospect of the ruin of\r\neither friend or foe, and drew a restless hand jerkily through his\r\nunruly yellow locks. Amalric stared at the man from Acheron with mingled\r\nfear and admiration.\r\n\r\n'If we caught Conan in Shirki valley with the hill ridges to his right\r\nand the river in flood to his left,' he admitted, 'with our whole force\r\nwe could annihilate him. Do you think--are you sure--do you believe such\r\nrains will fall?'\r\n\r\n'I go to my tent,' answered Xaltotun, rising. 'Necromancy is not\r\naccomplished by the waving of a wand. Send a rider to Tarascus. And let\r\nnone approach my tent.'\r\n\r\nThat last command was unnecessary. No man in that host could have been\r\nbribed to approach that mysterious black silken pavilion, the door-flaps\r\nof which were always closely drawn. None but Xaltotun ever entered it,\r\nyet voices were often heard issuing from it; its walls billowed\r\nsometimes without a wind, and weird music came from it. Sometimes, deep\r\nin midnight, its silken walls were lit red by flames flickering within,\r\nlimning misshapen silhouettes that passed to and fro.\r\n\r\nLying in his own tent that night, Amalric heard the steady rumble of a\r\ndrum in Xaltotun's tent; through the darkness it boomed steadily, and\r\noccasionally the Nemedian could have sworn that a deep, croaking voice\r\nmingled with the pulse of the drum. And he shuddered, for he knew that\r\nvoice was not the voice of Xaltotun. The drum rustled and muttered on\r\nlike deep thunder, heard afar off, and before dawn Amalric glancing from\r\nhis tent, caught the red flicker of lightning afar on the northern\r\nhorizon. In all other parts of the sky the great stars blazed whitely.\r\nBut the distant lightning flickered incessantly, like the crimson glint\r\nof firelight on a tiny, turning blade.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt sunset of the next day Tarascus came up with his host, dusty and\r\nweary from hard marching, the footmen straggling hours behind the\r\nhorsemen. They camped in the plain near Amalric's camp, and at dawn the\r\ncombined army moved westward.\r\n\r\nAhead of him roved a swarm of scouts, and Amalric waited impatiently for\r\nthem to return and tell of the Poitanians trapped beside a furious\r\nflood. But when the scouts met the column it was with the news that\r\nConan had crossed the river!\r\n\r\n'What?' exclaimed Amalric. 'Did he cross before the flood?'\r\n\r\n'There was no flood,' answered the scouts, puzzled. 'Late last night he\r\ncame up to Tanasul and flung his army across.'\r\n\r\n'No flood?' exclaimed Xaltotun, taken aback for the first time in\r\nAmalric's knowledge. 'Impossible! There were mighty rains upon the\r\nheadwaters of the Shirki last night and the night before that!'\r\n\r\n'That may be your lordship,' answered the scout. 'It is true the water\r\nwas muddy, and the people of Tanasul said that the river rose perhaps a\r\nfoot yesterday; but that was not enough to prevent Conan's crossing.'\r\n\r\nXaltotun's sorcery had failed! The thought hammered in Amalric's brain.\r\nHis horror of this strange man out of the past had grown steadily since\r\nthat night in Belverus when he had seen a brown, shriveled mummy swell\r\nand grow into a living man. And the death of Orastes had changed lurking\r\nhorror into active fear. In his heart was a grisly conviction that the\r\nman--or devil--was invincible. Yet now he had undeniable proof of his\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\nYet even the greatest of necromancers might fail occasionally, thought\r\nthe baron. At any rate, he dared not oppose the man from Acheron--yet.\r\nOrastes was dead, writhing in Mitra only knew what nameless hell, and\r\nAmalric knew his sword would scarcely prevail where the black wisdom of\r\nthe renegade priest had failed. What grisly abomination Xaltotun plotted\r\nlay in the unpredictable future. Conan and his host were a present\r\nmenace against which Xaltotun's wizardry might well be needed before the\r\nplay was all played.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey came to Tanasul, a small fortified village at the spot where a reef\r\nof rocks made a natural bridge across the river, passable always except\r\nin times of greatest flood. Scouts brought in the news that Conan had\r\ntaken up his position in the Goralian hills, which began to rise a few\r\nmiles beyond the river. And just before sundown the Gundermen had\r\narrived in his camp.\r\n\r\nAmalric looked at Xaltotun, inscrutable and alien in the light of the\r\nflaring torches. Night had fallen.\r\n\r\n'What now? Your magic has failed. Conan confronts us with an army nearly\r\nas strong as our own, and he has the advantage of position. We have a\r\nchoice of two evils: to camp here and await his attack, or to fall back\r\ntoward Tarantia and await reinforcements.'\r\n\r\n'We are ruined if we wait,' answered Xaltotun. 'Cross the river and camp\r\non the plain. We will attack at dawn.'\r\n\r\n'But his position is too strong!' exclaimed Amalric.\r\n\r\n'Fool!' A gust of passion broke the veneer of the wizard's calm. 'Have\r\nyou forgotten Valkia? Because some obscure elemental principle prevented\r\nthe flood do you deem me helpless? I had intended that your spears\r\nshould exterminate our enemies; but do not fear: it is my arts that\r\nshall crush their host. Conan is in a trap. He will never see another\r\nsun set. Cross the river!'\r\n\r\nThey crossed by the flare of torches. The hoofs of the horses clinked on\r\nthe rocky bridge, splashed through the shallows. The glint of the\r\ntorches on shields and breast-plates was reflected redly in the black\r\nwater. The rock bridge was broad on which they crossed, but even so it\r\nwas past midnight before the host was camped in the plain beyond. Above\r\nthem they could see fires winking redly in the distance. Conan had\r\nturned at bay in the Goralian hills, which had more than once before\r\nserved as the last stand of an Aquilonian king.\r\n\r\nAmalric left his pavilion and strode restlessly through the camp. A\r\nweird glow flickered in Xaltotun's tent, and from time to time a\r\ndemoniacal cry slashed the silence, and there was a low sinister\r\nmuttering of a drum that rustled rather than rumbled.\r\n\r\nAmalric, his instincts whetted by the night and the circumstances, felt\r\nthat Xaltotun was opposed by more than physical force. Doubts of the\r\nwizard's power assailed him. He glanced at the fires high above him, and\r\nhis face set in grim lines. He and his army were deep in the midst of a\r\nhostile country. Up there among those hills lurked thousands of wolfish\r\nfigures out of whose hearts and souls all emotion and hope had been\r\nscourged except a frenzied hate for their conquerors, a mad lust for\r\nvengeance. Defeat meant annihilation, retreat through a land swarming\r\nwith blood-mad enemies. And on the morrow he must hurl his host against\r\nthe grimmest fighter in the western nations, and his desperate horde. If\r\nXaltotun failed them now--\r\n\r\nHalf a dozen men-at-arms strode out of the shadows. The firelight\r\nglinted on their breast-plates and helmet crests. Among them they half\r\nled, half dragged a gaunt figure in tattered rags.\r\n\r\nSaluting, they spoke: 'My lord, this man came to the outposts and said\r\nhe desired word with King Valerius. He is an Aquilonian.'\r\n\r\nHe looked more like a wolf--a wolf the traps had scarred. Old sores that\r\nonly fetters make showed on his wrists and ankles. A great brand, the\r\nmark of hot iron, disfigured his face. His eyes glared through the\r\ntangle of his matted hair as he half crouched before the baron.\r\n\r\n'Who are you, you filthy dog?' demanded the Nemedian.\r\n\r\n'Call me Tiberias,' answered the man, and his teeth clicked in an\r\ninvoluntary spasm. 'I have come to tell you how to trap Conan.'\r\n\r\n'A traitor, eh?' rumbled the baron.\r\n\r\n'Men say you have gold,' mouthed the man, shivering under his rags.\r\n'Give some to me! Give me gold and I will show you how to defeat the\r\nking!' His eyes glazed widely, his outstretched, upturned hands were\r\nspread like quivering claws.\r\n\r\nAmalric shrugged his shoulder in distaste. But no tool was too base for\r\nhis use.\r\n\r\n'If you speak the truth you shall have more gold than you can carry,' he\r\nsaid. 'If you are a liar and a spy I will have you crucified head-down.\r\nBring him along.'\r\n\r\nIn the tent of Valerius, the baron pointed to the man who crouched\r\nshivering before them, huddling his rags about him.\r\n\r\n'He says he knows a way to aid us on the morrow. We will need aid, if\r\nXaltotun's plan is no better than it has proved so far. Speak on, dog.'\r\n\r\nThe man's body writhed in strange convulsions. Words came in a stumbling\r\nrush:\r\n\r\n'Conan camps at the head of the Valley of Lions. It is shaped like a\r\nfan, with steep hills on either side. If you attack him tomorrow you\r\nwill have to march straight up the valley. You cannot climb the hills on\r\neither side. But if King Valerius will deign to accept my service, I\r\nwill guide him through the hills and show him how he can come upon King\r\nConan from behind. But if it is to be done at all, we must start soon.\r\nIt is many hours' riding, for one must go miles to the west, then miles\r\nto the north, then turn eastward and so come into the Valley of Lions\r\nfrom behind, as the Gundermen came.'\r\n\r\nAmalric hesitated, tugging his chin. In these chaotic times it was not\r\nrare to find men willing to sell their souls for a few gold pieces.\r\n\r\n'If you lead me astray you will die,' said Valerius. 'You are aware of\r\nthat, are you not?'\r\n\r\nThe man shivered, but his wide eyes did not waver.\r\n\r\n'If I betray you, slay me!'\r\n\r\n'Conan will not dare divide his force,' mused Amalric. 'He will need all\r\nhis men to repel our attack. He cannot spare any to lay ambushes in the\r\nhills. Besides, this fellow knows his hide depends on his leading you as\r\nhe promised. Would a dog like him sacrifice himself? Nonsense! No,\r\nValerius, I believe the man is honest.'\r\n\r\n'Or a greater thief than most, for he would sell his liberator,' laughed\r\nValerius. 'Very well. I will follow the dog. How many men can you spare\r\nme?'\r\n\r\n'Five thousand should be enough,' answered Amalric. 'A surprise attack\r\non their rear will throw them into confusion, and that will be enough. I\r\nshall expect your attack about noon.'\r\n\r\n'You will know when I strike,' answered Valerius.\r\n\r\nAs Amalric returned to his pavilion he noted with gratification that\r\nXaltotun was still in his tent, to judge from the blood-freezing cries\r\nthat shuddered forth into the night air from time to time. When\r\npresently he heard the clink of steel and the jingle of bridles in the\r\nouter darkness, he smiled grimly. Valerius had about served his purpose.\r\nThe baron knew that Conan was like a wounded lion that rends and tears\r\neven in his death-throes. When Valerius struck from the rear, the\r\ndesperate strokes of the Cimmerian might well wipe his rival out of\r\nexistence before he himself succumbed. So much the better. Amalric felt\r\nhe could well dispense with Valerius, once he had paved the way for a\r\nNemedian victory.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe five thousand horsemen who accompanied Valerius were hard-bitten\r\nAquilonian renegades for the most part. In the still starlight they\r\nmoved out of the sleeping camp, following the westward trend of the\r\ngreat black masses that rose against the stars ahead of them. Valerius\r\nrode at their head, and beside him rode Tiberias, a leather thong about\r\nhis wrist gripped by a man-at-arms who rode on the other side of him.\r\nOthers kept close behind with drawn swords.\r\n\r\n'Play us false and you die instantly,' Valerius pointed out. 'I do not\r\nknow every sheep-path in these hills, but I know enough about the\r\ngeneral configuration of the country to know the directions we must take\r\nto come in behind the Valley of Lions. See that you do not lead us\r\nastray.'\r\n\r\nThe man ducked his head and his teeth chattered as he volubly assured\r\nhis captor of his loyalty, staring up stupidly at the banner that\r\nfloated over him, the golden serpent of the old dynasty.\r\n\r\nSkirting the extremities of the hills that locked the Valley of Lions,\r\nthey swung wide to the west. An hour's ride and they turned north,\r\nforging through wild and rugged hills, following dim trails and tortuous\r\npaths. Sunrise found them some miles northwest of Conan's position, and\r\nhere the guide turned eastward and led them through a maze of labyrinths\r\nand crags. Valerius nodded, judging their position by various peaks\r\nthrusting up above the others. He had kept his bearings in a general\r\nway, and he knew they were still headed in the right direction.\r\n\r\nBut now, without warning, a gray fleecy mass came billowing down from\r\nthe north, veiling the slopes, spreading out through the valleys. It\r\nblotted out the sun; the world became a blind gray void in which\r\nvisibility was limited to a matter of yards. Advance became a stumbling,\r\ngroping muddle. Valerius cursed. He could no longer see the peaks that\r\nhad served him as guide-posts. He must depend wholly upon the traitorous\r\nguide. The golden serpent drooped in the windless air.\r\n\r\nPresently Tiberias seemed himself confused; he halted, stared about\r\nuncertainly.\r\n\r\n'Are you lost, dog?' demanded Valerius harshly.\r\n\r\n'Listen!'\r\n\r\nSomewhere ahead of them a faint vibration began, the rhythmic rumble of\r\na drum.\r\n\r\n'Conan's drum!' exclaimed the Aquilonian.\r\n\r\n'If we are close enough to hear the drum,' said Valerius, 'why do we not\r\nhear the shouts and the clang of arms? Surely battle has joined.'\r\n\r\n'The gorges and the winds play strange tricks,' answered Tiberias, his\r\nteeth chattering with the ague that is frequently the lot of men who\r\nhave spent much time in damp underground dungeons.\r\n\r\n'Listen!'\r\n\r\nFaintly to their ears came a low muffled roar.\r\n\r\n'They are fighting down in the valley!' cried Tiberias. 'The drum is\r\nbeating on the heights. Let us hasten!'\r\n\r\nHe rode straight on toward the sound of the distant drum as one who\r\nknows his ground at last. Valerius followed, cursing the fog. Then it\r\noccurred to him that it would mask his advance. Conan could not see him\r\ncoming. He would be at the Cimmerian's back before the noonday sun\r\ndispelled the mists.\r\n\r\nJust now he could not tell what lay on either hand, whether cliffs,\r\nthickets or gorges. The drum throbbed unceasingly, growing louder as\r\nthey advanced, but they heard no more of the battle. Valerius had no\r\nidea toward what point of the compass they were headed. He started as he\r\nsaw gray rock walls looming through the smoky drifts on either hand, and\r\nrealized that they were riding through a narrow defile. But the guide\r\nshowed no sign of nervousness, and Valerius hove a sigh of relief when\r\nthe walls widened out and became invisible in the fog. They were through\r\nthe defile; if an ambush had been planned, it would have been made in\r\nthat pass.\r\n\r\nBut now Tiberias halted again. The drum was rumbling louder, and\r\nValerius could not determine from what direction the sound was coming.\r\nNow it seemed ahead of him, now behind, now on one hand or the other.\r\nValerius glared about him impatiently, sitting on his war-horse with\r\nwisps of mist curling about him and the moisture gleaming on his armor.\r\nBehind him the long lines of steel-clad riders faded away and away like\r\nphantoms into the mist.\r\n\r\n'Why do you tarry, dog?' he demanded.\r\n\r\nThe man seemed to be listening to the ghostly drum. Slowly he\r\nstraightened in his saddle, turned his head and faced Valerius, and the\r\nsmile on his lips was terrible to see.\r\n\r\n'The fog is thinning, Valerius,' he said in a new voice, pointing a bony\r\nfinger. 'Look!'\r\n\r\nThe drum was silent. The fog was fading away. First the crests of cliffs\r\ncame in sight above the gray clouds, tall and spectral. Lower and lower\r\ncrawled the mists, shrinking, fading. Valerius started up in his\r\nstirrups with a cry that the horsemen echoed behind him. On all sides of\r\nthem the cliffs towered. They were not in a wide, open valley as he had\r\nsupposed. They were in a blind gorge walled by sheer cliffs hundreds of\r\nfeet high. The only entrance or exit was that narrow defile through\r\nwhich they had ridden.\r\n\r\n'Dog!' Valerius struck Tiberias full in the mouth with his clenched\r\nmailed hand. 'What devil's trick is this?'\r\n\r\nTiberias spat out a mouthful of blood and shook with fearful laughter.\r\n\r\n'A trick that shall rid the world of a beast! Look, dog!'\r\n\r\nAgain Valerius cried out, more in fury than in fear.\r\n\r\nThe defile was blocked by a wild and terrible band of men who stood\r\nsilent as images--ragged, shock-headed men with spears in their\r\nhands--hundreds of them. And up on the cliffs appeared other\r\nfaces--thousands of faces--wild, gaunt, ferocious faces, marked by fire\r\nand steel and starvation.\r\n\r\n'A trick of Conan's!' raged Valerius.\r\n\r\n'Conan knows nothing of it,' laughed Tiberias. 'It was the plot of\r\nbroken men, of men you ruined and turned to beasts. Amalric was right.\r\nConan has not divided his army. We are the rabble who followed him, the\r\nwolves who skulked in these hills, the homeless men, the hopeless men.\r\nThis was our plan, and the priests of Asura aided us with their mist.\r\nLook at them, Valerius! Each bears the mark of your hand, on his body or\r\non his heart!\r\n\r\n'Look at me! You do not know me, do you, what of this scar your hangman\r\nburned upon me? Once you knew me. Once I was lord of Amilius, the man\r\nwhose sons you murdered, whose daughter your mercenaries ravished and\r\nslew. You said I would not sacrifice myself to trap you? Almighty gods,\r\nif I had a thousand lives I would give them all to buy your doom!\r\n\r\n'And I have bought it! Look on the men you broke, dead men who once\r\nplayed the king! Their hour has come! This gorge is your tomb. Try to\r\nclimb the cliffs: they are steep, they are high. Try to fight your way\r\nback through the defile: spears will block your path, boulders will\r\ncrush you from above! Dog! I will be waiting for you in hell!'\r\n\r\nThrowing back his head he laughed until the rocks rang. Valerius leaned\r\nfrom his saddle and slashed down with his great sword, severing\r\nshoulder-bone and breast. Tiberias sank to the earth, still laughing\r\nghastily through a gurgle of gushing blood.\r\n\r\nThe drums had begun again, encircling the gorge with guttural thunder;\r\nboulders came crashing down; above the screams of dying men shrilled the\r\narrows in blinding clouds from the cliffs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nThe Road to Acheron\r\n\r\n\r\nDawn was just whitening the east when Amalric drew up his hosts in the\r\nmouth of the Valley of Lions. This valley was flanked by low, rolling\r\nbut steep hills, and the floor pitched upward in a series of irregular\r\nnatural terraces. On the uppermost of these terraces Conan's army held\r\nits position, awaiting the attack. The host that had joined him,\r\nmarching down from Gunderland, had not been composed exclusively of\r\nspearmen. With them had come seven thousand Bossonian archers, and four\r\nthousand barons and their retainers of the north and west, swelling the\r\nranks of his cavalry.\r\n\r\nThe pikemen were drawn up in a compact wedge-shaped formation at the\r\nnarrow head of the valley. There were nineteen thousand of them, mostly\r\nGundermen, though some four thousand were Aquilonians of other\r\nprovinces. They were flanked on either hand by five thousand Bossonian\r\narchers. Behind the ranks of the pikemen the knights sat their steeds\r\nmotionless, lances raised: ten thousand knights of Poitain, nine\r\nthousand Aquilonians, barons and their retainers.\r\n\r\nIt was a strong position. His flanks could not be turned, for that would\r\nmean climbing the steep, wooded hills in the teeth of the arrows and\r\nswords of the Bossonians. His camp lay directly behind him, in a narrow,\r\nsteep-walled valley which was indeed merely a continuation of the Valley\r\nof Lions, pitching up at a higher level. He did not fear a surprise from\r\nthe rear, because the hills behind him were full of refugees and broken\r\nmen whose loyalty to him was beyond question.\r\n\r\nBut if his position was hard to shake, it was equally hard to escape\r\nfrom. It was a trap as well as a fortress for the defenders, a desperate\r\nlast stand of men who did not expect to survive unless they were\r\nvictorious. The only line of retreat possible was through the narrow\r\nvalley at their rear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nXaltotun mounted a hill on the left side of the valley, near the wide\r\nmouth. This hill rose higher than the others, and was known as the\r\nKing's Altar, for a reason long forgotten. Only Xaltotun knew, and his\r\nmemory dated back three thousand years.\r\n\r\nHe was not alone. His two familiars, silent, hairy, furtive and dark,\r\nwere with him, and they bore a young Aquilonian girl, bound hand and\r\nfoot. They laid her on an ancient stone, which was curiously like an\r\naltar, and which crowned the summit of the hill. For long centuries it\r\nhad stood there, worn by the elements until many doubted that it was\r\nanything but a curiously shapen natural rock. But what it was, and why\r\nit stood there, Xaltotun remembered from of old. The familiars went\r\naway, with their bent backs like silent gnomes, and Xaltotun stood alone\r\nbeside the altar, his dark beard blown in the wind, overlooking the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nHe could see clear back to the winding Shirki, and up into the hills\r\nbeyond the head of the valley. He could see the gleaming wedge of steel\r\ndrawn up at the head of the terraces, the burganets of the archers\r\nglinting among the rocks and bushes, the silent knights motionless on\r\ntheir steeds, their pennons flowing above their helmets, their lances\r\nrising in a bristling thicket.\r\n\r\nLooking in the other direction he could see the long serried lines of\r\nthe Nemedians moving in ranks of shining steel into the mouth of the\r\nvalley. Behind them the gay pavilions of the lords and knights and the\r\ndrab tents of the common soldiers stretched back almost to the river.\r\n\r\nLike a river of molten steel the Nemedian host flowed into the valley,\r\nthe great scarlet dragon rippling over it. First marched the bowmen, in\r\neven ranks, arbalests half raised, bolts nocked, fingers on triggers.\r\nAfter them came the pikemen, and behind them the real strength of the\r\narmy--the mounted knights, their banners unfurled to the wind, their\r\nlances lifted, walking their great steeds forward as if they rode to a\r\nbanquet.\r\n\r\nAnd higher up on the slopes the smaller Aquilonian host stood grimly\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nThere were thirty thousand Nemedian knights, and, as in most Hyborian\r\nnations, it was the chivalry which was the sword of the army. The\r\nfootmen were used only to clear the way for a charge of the armored\r\nknights. There were twenty-one thousand of these, pikemen and archers.\r\n\r\nThe bowmen began loosing as they advanced, without breaking ranks,\r\nlaunching their quarrels with a whir and tang. But the bolts fell short\r\nor rattled harmlessly from the overlapping shields of the Gundermen. And\r\nbefore the arbalesters could come within killing range, the arching\r\nshafts of the Bossonians were wreaking havoc in their ranks.\r\n\r\nA little of this, a futile attempt at exchanging fire, and the Nemedian\r\nbowmen began falling back in disorder. Their armor was light, their\r\nweapons no match for the Bossonian longbows. The western archers were\r\nsheltered by bushes and rocks. Moreover, the Nemedian footmen lacked\r\nsomething of the morale of the horsemen, knowing as they did that they\r\nwere being used merely to clear the way for the knights.\r\n\r\nThe cross-bowmen fell back, and between their opening lines the pikemen\r\nadvanced. These were largely mercenaries, and their masters had no\r\ncompunction about sacrificing them. They were intended to mask the\r\nadvance of the knights until the latter were within smiting distance. So\r\nwhile the arbalesters plied their bolts from either flank at long range,\r\nthe pikemen marched into the teeth of the blast from above, and behind\r\nthem the knights came on.\r\n\r\nWhen the pikemen began to falter beneath the savage hail of death that\r\nwhistled down the slopes among them, a trumpet blew, their companies\r\ndivided to right and left, and through them the mailed knights\r\nthundered.\r\n\r\nThey ran full into a cloud of stinging death. The clothyard shafts found\r\nevery crevice in their armor and the housings of the steeds. Horses\r\nscrambling up the grassy terraces reared and plunged backward, bearing\r\ntheir riders with them. Steel-clad forms littered the slopes. The charge\r\nwavered and ebbed back.\r\n\r\nBack down in the valley Amalric reformed his ranks. Tarascus was\r\nfighting with drawn sword under the scarlet dragon, but it was the baron\r\nof Tor who commanded that day. Amalric swore as he glanced at the forest\r\nof lance-tips visible above and beyond the head-pieces of the Gundermen.\r\nHe had hoped his retirement would draw the knights out in a charge down\r\nthe slopes after him, to be raked from either flank by his bowmen and\r\nswamped by the numbers of his horsemen. But they had not moved.\r\nCamp-servants brought skins of water from the river. Knights doffed\r\ntheir helmets and drenched their sweating heads. The wounded on the\r\nslopes screamed vainly for water. In the upper valley, springs supplied\r\nthe defenders. They did not thirst that long, hot spring day.\r\n\r\nOn the King's Altar, beside the ancient, carven stone, Xaltotun watched\r\nthe steel tide ebb and flow. On came the knights, with waving plumes and\r\ndipping lances. Through a whistling cloud of arrows they plowed to break\r\nlike a thundering wave on the bristling wall of spears and shields. Axes\r\nrose and fell above the plumed helmets, spears thrust upward, bringing\r\ndown horses and riders. The pride of the Gundermen was no less fierce\r\nthan that of the knights. They were not spear-fodder, to be sacrificed\r\nfor the glory of better men. They were the finest infantry in the world,\r\nwith a tradition that made their morale unshakable. The kings of\r\nAquilonia had long learned the worth of unbreakable infantry. They held\r\ntheir formation unshaken; over their gleaming ranks flowed the great\r\nlion banner, and at the tip of the wedge a giant figure in black armor\r\nroared and smote like a hurricane, with a dripping ax that split steel\r\nand bone alike.\r\n\r\nThe Nemedians fought as gallantly as their traditions of high courage\r\ndemanded. But they could not break the iron wedge, and from the wooded\r\nknolls on either hand arrows raked their close-packed ranks mercilessly.\r\nTheir own bowmen were useless, their pikemen unable to climb the heights\r\nand come to grips with the Bossonians. Slowly, stubbornly, sullenly, the\r\ngrim knights fell back, counting their empty saddles. Above them the\r\nGundermen made no outcry of triumph. They closed their ranks, locking up\r\nthe gaps made by the fallen. Sweat ran into their eyes from under their\r\nsteel caps. They gripped their spears and waited, their fierce hearts\r\nswelling with pride that a king should fight on foot with them. Behind\r\nthem the Aquilonian knights had not moved. They sat their steeds, grimly\r\nimmobile.\r\n\r\nA knight spurred a sweating horse up the hill called the King's Altar,\r\nand glared at Xaltotun with bitter eyes.\r\n\r\n'Amalric bids me say that it is time to use your magic, wizard,' he\r\nsaid. 'We are dying like flies down there in the valley. We cannot break\r\ntheir ranks.'\r\n\r\nXaltotun seemed to expand, to grow tall and awesome and terrible.\r\n\r\n'Return to Amalric,' he said. 'Tell him to re-form his ranks for a\r\ncharge, but to await my signal. Before that signal is given he will see\r\na sight that he will remember until he lies dying!'\r\n\r\nThe knight saluted as if compelled against his will, and thundered down\r\nthe hill at breakneck pace.\r\n\r\nXaltotun stood beside the dark altar-stone and stared across the valley,\r\nat the dead and wounded men on the terraces, at the grim, blood-stained\r\nband at the head of the slopes, at the dusty, steel-clad ranks reforming\r\nin the vale below. He glanced up at the sky, and he glanced down at the\r\nslim white figure on the dark stone. And lifting a dagger inlaid with\r\narchaic hieroglyphs, he intoned an immemorial invocation:\r\n\r\n'Set, god of darkness, scaly lord of the shadows, by the blood of a\r\nvirgin and the sevenfold symbol I call to your sons below the black\r\nearth! Children of the deeps, below the red earth, under the black\r\nearth, awaken and shake your awful manes! Let the hills rock and the\r\nstones topple upon my enemies! Let the sky grow dark above them, the\r\nearth unstable beneath their feet! Let a wind from the deep black earth\r\ncurl up beneath their feet, and blacken and shrivel them----'\r\n\r\nHe halted short, dagger lifted. In the tense silence the roar of the\r\nhosts rose beneath him, borne on the wind.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the altar stood a man in a black hooded robe, whose\r\ncoif shadowed pale delicate features and dark eyes calm and meditative.\r\n\r\n'Dog of Asura!' whispered Xaltotun, his voice was like the hiss of an\r\nangered serpent. 'Are you mad, that you seek your doom? Ho, Baal!\r\nChiron!'\r\n\r\n'Call again, dog of Acheron!' said the other, and laughed. 'Summon them\r\nloudly. They will not hear, unless your shouts reverberate in hell.'\r\n\r\nFrom a thicket on the edge of the crest came a somber old woman in\r\npeasant garb, her hair flowing over her shoulders, a great gray wolf\r\nfollowing at her heels.\r\n\r\n'Witch, priest and wolf,' muttered Xaltotun grimly, and laughed. 'Fools,\r\nto pit your charlatan's mummery against my arts! With a wave of my hand\r\nI brush you from my path!'\r\n\r\n'Your arts are straws in the wind, dog of Python,' answered the Asurian.\r\n'Have you wondered why the Shirki did not come down in flood and trap\r\nConan on the other bank? When I saw the lightning in the night I guessed\r\nyour plan, and my spells dispersed the clouds you had summoned before\r\nthey could empty their torrents. You did not even know that your\r\nrain-making wizardry had failed.'\r\n\r\n'You lie!' cried Xaltotun, but the confidence in his voice was shaken.\r\n'I have felt the impact of a powerful sorcery against mine--but no man\r\non earth could undo the rain-magic, once made, unless he possessed the\r\nvery heart of sorcery.'\r\n\r\n'But the flood you plotted did not come to pass,' answered the priest.\r\n'Look at your allies in the valley, Pythonian! You have led them to the\r\nslaughter! They are caught in the fangs of the trap, and you cannot aid\r\nthem. Look!'\r\n\r\nHe pointed. Out of the narrow gorge of the upper valley, behind the\r\nPoitanians, a horseman came flying, whirling something about his head\r\nthat flashed in the sun. Recklessly he hurtled down the slopes, through\r\nthe ranks of the Gundermen, who sent up a deep-throated roar and clashed\r\ntheir spears and shields like thunder in the hills. On the terraces\r\nbetween the hosts the sweat-soaked horse reared and plunged, and his\r\nwild rider yelled and brandished the thing in his hands like one\r\ndemented. It was the torn remnant of a scarlet banner, and the sun\r\nstruck dazzlingly on the golden scales of a serpent that writhed\r\nthereon.\r\n\r\n'Valerius is dead!' cried Hadrathus ringingly. 'A fog and a drum lured\r\nhim to his doom! I gathered that fog, dog of Python, and I dispersed it!\r\nI, with my magic which is greater than your magic!'\r\n\r\n'What matters it?' roared Xaltotun, a terrible sight, his eyes blazing,\r\nhis features convulsed. 'Valerius was a fool. I do not need him. I can\r\ncrush Conan without human aid!'\r\n\r\n'Why have you delayed?' mocked Hadrathus. 'Why have you allowed so many\r\nof your allies to fall pierced by arrows and spitted on spears?'\r\n\r\n'Because blood aids great sorcery!' thundered Xaltotun, in a voice that\r\nmade the rocks quiver. A lurid nimbus played about his awful head.\r\n'Because no wizard wastes his strength thoughtlessly. Because I would\r\nconserve my powers for the great days to be, rather than employ them in\r\na hill-country brawl. But now, by Set, I shall loose them to the\r\nuttermost! Watch, dog of Asura, false priest of an outworn god, and see\r\na sight that shall blast your reason for evermore!'\r\n\r\nHadrathus threw back his head and laughed, and hell was in his laughter.\r\n\r\n'Look, black devil of Python!'\r\n\r\nHis hand came from under his robe holding something that flamed and\r\nburned in the sun, changing the light to a pulsing golden glow in which\r\nthe flesh of Xaltotun looked like the flesh of a corpse.\r\n\r\nXaltotun cried out as if he had been stabbed.\r\n\r\n'The Heart! The Heart of Ahriman!'\r\n\r\n'Aye! The one power that is greater than your power!'\r\n\r\nXaltotun seemed to shrivel, to grow old. Suddenly his beard was shot\r\nwith snow, his locks flecked with gray.\r\n\r\n'The Heart!' he mumbled. 'You stole it! Dog! Thief!'\r\n\r\n'Not I! It has been on a long journey far to the southward. But now it\r\nis in my hands, and your black arts cannot stand against it. As it\r\nresurrected you, so shall it hurl you back into the night whence it drew\r\nyou. You shall go down the dark road to Acheron, which is the road of\r\nsilence and the night. The dark empire, unreborn, shall remain a legend\r\nand a black memory. Conan shall reign again. And the Heart of Ahriman\r\nshall go back into the cavern below the temple of Mitra, to burn as a\r\nsymbol of the power of Aquilonia for a thousand years!'\r\n\r\nXaltotun screamed inhumanly and rushed around the altar, dagger lifted;\r\nbut from somewhere--out of the sky, perhaps, or the great jewel that\r\nblazed in the hand of Hadrathus--shot a jetting beam of blinding blue\r\nlight. Full against the breast of Xaltotun it flashed, and the hills\r\nre-echoed the concussion. The wizard of Acheron went down as though\r\nstruck by a thunderbolt, and before he touched the ground he was\r\nfearfully altered. Beside the altar-stone lay no fresh-slain corpse, but\r\na shriveled mummy, a brown, dry, unrecognizable carcass sprawling among\r\nmoldering swathings.\r\n\r\nSomberly old Zelata looked down.\r\n\r\n'He was not a living man,' she said. 'The Heart lent him a false aspect\r\nof life, that deceived even himself. I never saw him as other than a\r\nmummy.'\r\n\r\nHadrathus bent to unbind the swooning girl on the altar, when from among\r\nthe trees appeared a strange apparition--Xaltotun's chariot drawn by the\r\nweird horses. Silently they advanced to the altar and halted, with the\r\nchariot wheel almost touching the brown withered thing on the grass.\r\nHadrathus lifted the body of the wizard and placed it in the chariot.\r\nAnd without hesitation the uncanny steeds turned and moved off\r\nsouthward, down the hill. And Hadrathus and Zelata and the gray wolf\r\nwatched them go--down the long road to Acheron which is beyond the ken\r\nof men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDown in the valley Amalric had stiffened in his saddle when he saw that\r\nwild horseman curvetting and caracoling on the slopes while he\r\nbrandished that blood-stained serpent-banner. Then some instinct jerked\r\nhis head about, toward the hill known as the King's Altar. And his lips\r\nparted. Every man in the valley saw it--an arching shaft of dazzling\r\nlight that towered up from the summit of the hill, showering golden\r\nfire. High above the hosts it burst in a blinding blaze that momentarily\r\npaled the sun.\r\n\r\n'That's not Xaltotun's signal!' roared the baron.\r\n\r\n'No!' shouted Tarascus. 'It's a signal to the Aquilonians! Look!'\r\n\r\nAbove them the immobile ranks were moving at last, and a deep-throated\r\nroar thundered across the vale.\r\n\r\n'Xaltotun has failed us!' bellowed Amalric furiously. 'Valerius has\r\nfailed us! We have been led into a trap! Mitra's curse on Xaltotun who\r\nled us here! Sound the retreat!'\r\n\r\n'_Too late!_' yelled Tarascus. '_Look!_'\r\n\r\nUp on the slopes the forest of lances dipped, leveled. The ranks of the\r\nGundermen rolled back to right and left like a parting curtain. And with\r\na thunder like the rising roar of a hurricane, the knights of Aquilonia\r\ncrashed down the slopes.\r\n\r\nThe impetus of that charge was irresistible. Bolts driven by the\r\ndemoralized arbalesters glanced from their shields, their bent helmets.\r\nTheir plumes and pennons streaming out behind them, their lances\r\nlowered, they swept over the wavering lines of pikemen and roared down\r\nthe slopes like a wave.\r\n\r\nAmalric yelled an order to charge, and the Nemedians with desperate\r\ncourage spurred their horses at the slopes. They still outnumbered the\r\nattackers.\r\n\r\nBut they were weary men on tired horses, charging uphill. The onrushing\r\nknights had not struck a blow that day. Their horses were fresh. They\r\nwere coming downhill and they came like a thunderbolt. And like a\r\nthunderbolt they smote the struggling ranks of the Nemedians--smote\r\nthem, split them apart, ripped them asunder and dashed the remnants\r\nheadlong down the slopes.\r\n\r\nAfter them on foot came the Gundermen, blood-mad, and the Bossonians\r\nwere swarming down the hills, loosing as they ran at every foe that\r\nstill moved.\r\n\r\nDown the slopes washed the tide of battle, the dazed Nemedians swept on\r\nthe crest of the wave. Their archers had thrown down their arbalests and\r\nwere fleeing. Such pikemen as had survived the blasting charge of the\r\nknights were cut to pieces by the ruthless Gundermen.\r\n\r\nIn a wild confusion the battle swept through the wide mouth of the\r\nvalley and into the plain beyond. All over the plain swarmed the\r\nwarriors, fleeing and pursuing, broken into single combat and clumps of\r\nsmiting, hacking knights on rearing, wheeling horses. But the Nemedians\r\nwere smashed, broken, unable to re-form or make a stand. By the hundreds\r\nthey broke away, spurring for the river. Many reached it, rushed across\r\nand rode eastward. The countryside was up behind them; the people hunted\r\nthem like wolves. Few ever reached Tarantia.\r\n\r\nThe final break did not come until the fall of Amalric. The baron,\r\nstriving in vain to rally his men, rode straight at the clump of knights\r\nthat followed the giant in black armor whose surcoat bore the royal\r\nlion, and over whose head floated the golden lion banner with the\r\nscarlet leopard of Poitain beside it. A tall warrior in gleaming armor\r\ncouched his lance and charged to meet the lord of Tor. They met like a\r\nthunderclap. The Nemedian's lance, striking his foe's helmet, snapped\r\nbolts and rivets and tore off the casque, revealing the features of\r\nPallantides. But the Aquilonian's lance-head crashed through shield and\r\nbreast-plate to transfix the baron's heart.\r\n\r\nA roar went up as Amalric was hurled from his saddle, snapping the lance\r\nthat impaled him, and the Nemedians gave way as a barrier bursts under\r\nthe surging impact of a tidal wave. They rode for the river in a blind\r\nstampede that swept the plain like a whirlwind. The hour of the Dragon\r\nhad passed.\r\n\r\nTarascus did not flee. Amalric was dead, the color-bearer slain, and the\r\nroyal Nemedian banner trampled in the blood and dust. Most of his\r\nknights were fleeing and the Aquilonians were riding them down; Tarascus\r\nknew the day was lost, but with a handful of faithful followers he raged\r\nthrough the mêlée, conscious of but one desire--to meet Conan, the\r\nCimmerian. And at last he met him.\r\n\r\nFormations had been destroyed utterly, close-knit bands broken asunder\r\nand swept apart. The crest of Trocero gleamed in one part of the plain,\r\nthose of Prospero and Pallantides in others. Conan was alone. The\r\nhouse-troops of Tarascus had fallen one by one. The two kings met man to\r\nman.\r\n\r\nEven as they rode at each other, the horse of Tarascus sobbed and sank\r\nunder him. Conan leaped from his own steed and ran at him, as the king\r\nof Nemedia disengaged himself and rose. Steel flashed blindingly in the\r\nsun, clashed loudly, and blue sparks flew; then a clang of armor as\r\nTarascus measured his full length on the earth beneath a thunderous\r\nstroke of Conan's broadsword.\r\n\r\nThe Cimmerian placed a mail-shod foot on his enemy's breast, and lifted\r\nhis sword. His helmet was gone; he shook back his black mane and his\r\nblue eyes blazed with their old fire.\r\n\r\n'Do you yield?'\r\n\r\n'Will you give me quarter?' demanded the Nemedian.\r\n\r\n'Aye. Better than you'd have given me, you dog. Life for you and all\r\nyour men who throw down their arms. Though I ought to split your head\r\nfor an infernal thief,' the Cimmerian added.\r\n\r\nTarascus twisted his neck and glared over the plain. The remnants of the\r\nNemedian host were flying across the stone bridge with swarms of\r\nvictorious Aquilonians at their heels, smiting with fury of glutted\r\nvengeance. Bossonians and Gundermen were swarming through the camp of\r\ntheir enemies, tearing the tents to pieces in search of plunder, seizing\r\nprisoners, ripping open the baggage and upsetting the wagons.\r\n\r\nTarascus cursed fervently, and then shrugged his shoulders, as well as\r\nhe could, under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n'Very well. I have no choice. What are your demands?'\r\n\r\n'Surrender to me all your present holdings in Aquilonia. Order your\r\ngarrisons to march out of the castles and towns they hold, without their\r\narms, and get your infernal armies out of Aquilonia as quickly as\r\npossible. In addition you shall return all Aquilonians sold as slaves,\r\nand pay an indemnity to be designated later, when the damage your\r\noccupation of the country has caused has been properly estimated. You\r\nwill remain as hostage until these terms have been carried out.'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' surrendered Tarascus. 'I will surrender all the castles and\r\ntowns now held by my garrisons without resistance, and all the other\r\nthings shall be done. What ransom for my body?'\r\n\r\nConan laughed and removed his foot from his foe's steel-clad breast,\r\ngrasped his shoulder and heaved him to his feet. He started to speak,\r\nthen turned to see Hadrathus approaching him. The priest was as calm and\r\nself-possessed as ever, picking his way between rows of dead men and\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nConan wiped the sweat-smeared dust from his face with a blood-stained\r\nhand. He had fought all through the day, first on foot with the pikemen,\r\nthen in the saddle, leading the charge. His surcoat was gone, his armor\r\nsplashed with blood and battered with strokes of sword, mace and ax. He\r\nloomed gigantically against a background of blood and slaughter, like\r\nsome grim pagan hero of mythology.\r\n\r\n'Well done, Hadrathus!' quoth he gustily. 'By Crom, I am glad to see\r\nyour signal! My knights were almost mad with impatience and eating their\r\nhearts out to be at sword-strokes. I could not have held them much\r\nlonger. What of the wizard?'\r\n\r\n'He has gone down the dim road to Acheron,' answered Hadrathus. 'And\r\nI--I am for Tarantia. My work is done here, and I have a task to perform\r\nat the temple of Mitra. All our work is done here. On this field we have\r\nsaved Aquilonia--and more than Aquilonia. Your ride to your capital will\r\nbe a triumphal procession through a kingdom mad with joy. All Aquilonia\r\nwill be cheering the return of their king. And so, until we meet again\r\nin the great royal hall--farewell!'\r\n\r\nConan stood silently watching the priest as he went. From various parts\r\nof the field knights were hurrying toward him. He saw Pallantides,\r\nTrocero, Prospero, Servius Galannus, their armor splashed with crimson.\r\nThe thunder of battle was giving way to a roar of triumph and acclaim.\r\nAll eyes, hot with strife and shining with exultation, were turned\r\ntoward the great black figure of the king; mailed arms brandished\r\nred-stained swords. A confused torrent of sound rose, deep and\r\nthunderous as the sea-surf: '_Hail, Conan, king of Aquilonia!_'\r\n\r\nTarascus spoke.\r\n\r\n'You have not yet named my ransom.'\r\n\r\nConan laughed and slapped his sword home in its scabbard. He flexed his\r\nmighty arms, and ran his blood-stained fingers through his thick black\r\nlocks, as if feeling there his re-won crown.\r\n\r\n'There is a girl in your seraglio named Zenobia.'\r\n\r\n'Why, yes, so there is.'\r\n\r\n'Very well.' The king smiled as at an exceedingly pleasant memory. 'She\r\nshall be your ransom, and naught else. I will come to Belverus for her\r\nas I promised. She was a slave in Nemedia, but I will make her queen of\r\nAquilonia!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Hour of the Dragon, by Robert E. Howard",
