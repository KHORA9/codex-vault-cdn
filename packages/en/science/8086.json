He fizzes!  He does backflips and breaks the furniture!\r\nScience fiction needs Cory Doctorow!\r\n\r\nBruce Sterling Author, The Hacker Crackdown and Distraction\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nIn the true spirit of Walt Disney, Doctorow has ripped a part of our\r\ncommon culture, mixed it with a brilliant story, and burned into our\r\nculture a new set of memes that will be with us for a generation at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nLawrence Lessig Author, The Future of Ideas\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nCory Doctorow doesn't just write about the future - I think he lives\r\nthere. Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom isn't just a really good read,\r\nit's also, like the best kind of fiction, a kind of guide book. See the\r\nTomorrowland of Tomorrow today, and while you're there, why not drop by\r\nFrontierland, and the Haunted Mansion as well? (It's the Mansion that's\r\nthe haunted heart of this book.) Cory makes me feel nostalgic for the\r\nfuture - a dizzying, yet rather pleasant sensation, as if I'm spiraling\r\ndown the tracks of Space Mountain over and over again. Visit the Magic\r\nKingdom and live forever!\r\n\r\nKelly Link Author, Stranger Things Happen\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDown and Out in the Magic Kingdom is the most entertaining and exciting\r\nscience fiction story I've read in the last few years. I love page-\r\nturners, especially when they are as unusual as this novel. I predict\r\nbig things for Down and Out -- it could easily become a breakout genre-\r\nbuster.\r\n\r\nMark Frauenfelder Contributing Editor, Wired Magazine\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nImagine you woke up one day and Walt Disney had taken over the world.\r\nNot only that, but money's been abolished and somebody's developed the\r\nCure for Death.  Welcome to the Bitchun Society--and make sure you're\r\nstrapped in tight, because it's going to be a wild ride.  In a world\r\nwhere everyone's wishes can come true, one man returns to the original,\r\ncrumbling city of dreams--Disney World.   Here in the spiritual center\r\nof the Bitchun Society he struggles to find and preserve the original,\r\nhuman face of the Magic Kingdom against the young, post-human and\r\nincreasingly alien inheritors of the Earth.  Now that any experience can\r\nbe simulated, human relationships become ever more fragile; and to\r\nJulius, the corny, mechanical ghosts of the Haunted Mansion have come to\r\nseem like a precious link to a past when we could tell the real from the\r\nsimulated, the true from the false.\r\n\r\nCory Doctorow--cultural critic, Disneyphile, and ultimate Early Adopter\r\n--uses language with the reckless confidence of the Beat poets.  Yet\r\nbehind the dazzling prose and vibrant characters lie ideas we should all\r\npay heed to.  The future rushes on like a plummeting roller coaster, and\r\nit's hard to see where we're going.  But at least with this book\r\nDoctorow has given us a map of the park.\r\n\r\nKarl Schroeder Author, Permanence\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nCory Doctorow is the most interesting new SF writer I've come across in\r\nyears.Ê He starts out at the point where older SF writers' speculations\r\nend.Ê It's a distinct pleasure to give him some Whuffie.\r\n\r\nRudy Rucker Author, Spaceland\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nCory Doctorow rocks! I check his blog about ten times a day, because\r\nhe's always one of the first to notice a major incursion from the\r\nsocial-technological-pop-cultural future, and his voice is a compelling\r\nvehicle for news from the future. Down and Out in The Magic Kingdom is\r\nabout a world that is visible in its outlines today, if you know where\r\nto look, from reputation systems to peer-to-peer adhocracies. Doctorow\r\nknows where to look, and how to word-paint the rest of us into the\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nHoward Rheingold Author, Smart Mobs\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDoctorow is more than just a sick mind looking to twist the perceptions\r\nof those whose realities remain uncorrupted - though that should be\r\nenough recommendation to read his work. *Down and Out in the Magic\r\nKingdom* is black comedic, sci-fi prophecy on the dangers of\r\nsurrendering our consensual hallucination to the regime. Fun to read,\r\nbut difficult to sleep afterwards.\r\n\r\nDouglas Rushkoff Author of Cyberia and Media Virus!\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\n\"Wow! Disney imagineering meets nanotechnology, the reputation economy,\r\nand Ray Kurzweil's transhuman future.  As much fun as Neal Stephenson's\r\nSnow Crash, and as packed with mind bending ideas about social changes\r\ncascading from the frontiers of science.\"\r\n\r\nTim O'Reilly Publisher and Founder, O'Reilly and Associates\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDoctorow has created a rich and exciting vision of the future, and then\r\nwrote a page-turner of a story in it.  I couldn't put the book down.\r\n\r\nBruce Schneier Author, Secrets and Lies\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nCory Doctorow is one of our best new writers: smart, daring, savvy,\r\nentertaining, ambitious, plugged-in, and as good a guide to the wired\r\nworld of the twenty-first century that stretches out before us as you're\r\ngoing to find.\r\n\r\nGardner Dozois Editor, Asimov's SF\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nCory Doctorow's \"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\" tells a gripping,\r\nfast-paced story that hinges on thought-provoking extrapolation from\r\ntoday's technical realities. This is the sort of book that captures and\r\ndefines the spirit of a turning point in human history when our tools\r\nremake ourselves and our world.\r\n\r\nMitch Kapor Founder, Lotus, Inc., co-founder Electronic Frontier\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n======================= A note about this book: =======================\r\n\r\n\"Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom\" is my first novel. It's an actual,\r\nno-foolin' words-on-paper book, published by the good people at Tor\r\nBooks in New York City. You can buy this book in stores or online, by\r\nfollowing links like this one:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.craphound.com/down/buy.php\r\n\r\nSo, what's with this file? Good question.\r\n\r\nI'm releasing the entire text of this book as a free, freely\r\nredistributable e-book. You can download it, put it on a P2P net, put it\r\non your site, email it to a friend, and, if you're addicted to dead\r\ntrees, you can even print it.\r\n\r\nWhy am I doing this thing? Well, it's a long story, but to shorten it\r\nup: first-time novelists have a tough row to hoe. Our publishers don't\r\nhave a lot of promotional budget to throw at unknown factors like us.\r\nMostly, we rise and fall based on word-of-mouth. I'm not bad at word-of-\r\nmouth. I have a blog, Boing Boing (http://boingboing.net), where I do a\r\n*lot* of word-of-mouthing. I compulsively tell friends and strangers\r\nabout things that I like.\r\n\r\nAnd telling people about stuff I like is *way*, *way* easier if I can\r\njust send it to 'em. Way easier.\r\n\r\nWhat's more, P2P nets kick all kinds of ass. Most of the books, music\r\nand movies ever released are not available for sale, anywhere in the\r\nworld. In the brief time that P2P nets have flourished, the ad-hoc\r\nmasses of the Internet have managed to put just about *everything*\r\nonline. What's more, they've done it for cheaper than any other\r\narchiving/revival effort ever. I'm a stone infovore and this kinda\r\nInternet mishegas gives me a serious frisson of futurosity.\r\n\r\nYeah, there are legal problems. Yeah, it's hard to figure out how people\r\nare gonna make money doing it. Yeah, there is a lot of social upheaval\r\nand a serious threat to innovation, freedom, business, and whatnot. It's\r\nyour basic end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenario, and as a science\r\nfiction writer, end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it scenaria are my stock-in-\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nI'm especially grateful to my publisher, Tor Books (http://www.tor.com)\r\nand my editor, Patrick Nielsen Hayden\r\n(http://nielsenhayden.com/electrolite) for being hep enough to let me\r\ntry out this experiment.\r\n\r\nAll that said, here's the deal: I'm releasing this book under a license\r\ndeveloped by the Creative Commons project (http://creativecommons.org/).\r\nThis is a project that lets people like me roll our own license\r\nagreements for the distribution of our creative work under terms similar\r\nto those employed by the Free/Open Source Software movement.

He was a rangy cowpoke, apparent 25 or so, all\r\nrawhide squint-lines and sunburned neck, boots worn thin and infinitely\r\ncomfortable. I was in the middle of my Chem thesis, my fourth Doctorate,\r\nand he was taking a break from Saving the World, chilling on campus in\r\nToronto and core-dumping for some poor Anthro major. We hooked up at the\r\nGrad Students' Union -- the GSU, or Gazoo for those who knew -- on a\r\nbusy Friday night, spring-ish. I was fighting a coral-slow battle for a\r\nstool at the scratched bar, inching my way closer every time the press\r\nof bodies shifted, and he had one of the few seats, surrounded by a\r\nlitter of cigarette junk and empties, clearly encamped.\r\n\r\nSome duration into my foray, he cocked his head at me and raised a sun-\r\nbleached eyebrow. \"You get any closer, son, and we're going to have to\r\nget a pre-nup.\"\r\n\r\nI was apparent forty or so, and I thought about bridling at being called\r\nson, but I looked into his eyes and decided that he had enough realtime\r\nthat he could call me son anytime he wanted. I backed off a little and\r\napologized.\r\n\r\nHe struck a cig and blew a pungent, strong plume over the bartender's\r\nhead. \"Don't worry about it. I'm probably a little over accustomed to\r\npersonal space.\"\r\n\r\nI couldn't remember the last time I'd heard anyone on-world talk about\r\npersonal space. With the mortality rate at zero and the birth-rate at\r\nnon-zero, the world was inexorably accreting a dense carpet of people,\r\neven with the migratory and deadhead drains on the population. \"You've\r\nbeen jaunting?\" I asked -- his eyes were too sharp for him to have\r\nmissed an instant's experience to deadheading.\r\n\r\nHe chuckled. \"No sir, not me. I'm into the kind of macho shitheadery\r\nthat you only come across on-world. Jaunting's for play; I need work.\"\r\nThe bar-glass tinkled a counterpoint.\r\n\r\nI took a moment to conjure a HUD with his Whuffie score on it. I had to\r\nresize the window -- he had too many zeroes to fit on my standard\r\ndisplay. I tried to act cool, but he caught the upwards flick of my eyes\r\nand then their involuntary widening. He tried a little aw-shucksery,\r\ngave it up and let a prideful grin show.\r\n\r\n\"I try not to pay it much mind. Some people, they get overly grateful.\"\r\nHe must've seen my eyes flick up again, to pull his Whuffie history.\r\n\"Wait, don't go doing that -- I'll tell you about it, you really got to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n\"Damn, you know, it's so easy to get used to life without hyperlinks.\r\nYou'd think you'd really miss 'em, but you don't.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it clicked for me. He was a missionary -- one of those fringe-\r\ndwellers who act as emissary from the Bitchun Society to the benighted\r\ncorners of the world where, for whatever reasons, they want to die,\r\nstarve, and choke on petrochem waste. It's amazing that these\r\ncommunities survive more than a generation; in the Bitchun Society\r\nproper, we usually outlive our detractors. The missionaries don't have\r\nsuch a high success rate -- you have to be awfully convincing to get\r\nthrough to a culture that's already successfully resisted nearly a\r\ncentury's worth of propaganda -- but when you convert a whole village,\r\nyou accrue all the Whuffie they have to give. More often, missionaries\r\nend up getting refreshed from a backup after they aren't heard from for\r\na decade or so. I'd never met one in the flesh before.\r\n\r\n\"How many successful missions have you had?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Figured it out, huh? I've just come off my fifth in twenty years --\r\ncounterrevolutionaries hidden out in the old Cheyenne Mountain NORAD\r\nsite, still there a generation later.\" He sandpapered his whiskers with\r\nhis fingertips. \"Their parents went to ground after their life's savings\r\nvanished, and they had no use for tech any more advanced than a rifle.\r\nPlenty of those, though.\"\r\n\r\nHe spun a fascinating yarn then, how he slowly gained the acceptance of\r\nthe mountain-dwellers, and then their trust, and then betrayed it in\r\nsubtle, beneficent ways: introducing Free Energy to their greenhouses,\r\nthen a gengineered crop or two, then curing a couple deaths, slowly\r\ninching them toward the Bitchun Society, until they couldn't remember\r\nwhy they hadn't wanted to be a part of it from the start. Now they were\r\nmostly off-world, exploring toy frontiers with unlimited energy and\r\nunlimited supplies and deadheading through the dull times en route.\r\n\r\n\"I guess it'd be too much of a shock for them to stay on-world. They\r\nthink of us as the enemy, you know -- they had all kinds of plans drawn\r\nup for when we invaded them and took them away; hollow suicide teeth,\r\nbooby-traps, fall-back-and-rendezvous points for the survivors. They\r\njust can't get over hating us, even though we don't even know they\r\nexist. Off-world, they can pretend that they're still living rough and\r\nhard.\" He rubbed his chin again, his hard calluses grating over his\r\nwhiskers. \"But for me, the real rough life is right here, on-world. The\r\nlittle enclaves, each one is like an alternate history of humanity --\r\nwhat if we'd taken the Free Energy, but not deadheading? What if we'd\r\ntaken deadheading, but only for the critically ill, not for people who\r\ndidn't want to be bored on long bus-rides? Or no hyperlinks, no\r\nadhocracy, no Whuffie? Each one is different and wonderful.\"\r\n\r\nI have a stupid habit of arguing for the sake of, and I found myself\r\nsaying, \"Wonderful? Oh sure, nothing finer than, oh, let's see, dying,\r\nstarving, freezing, broiling, killing, cruelty and ignorance and pain\r\nand misery. I know I sure miss it.\"\r\n\r\nKeep A-Movin' Dan snorted. \"You think a junkie misses sobriety?\"\r\n\r\nI knocked on the bar. \"Hello! There aren't any junkies anymore!\"\r\n\r\nHe struck another cig. \"But you know what a junkie _is_, right? Junkies\r\ndon't miss sobriety, because they don't remember how sharp everything\r\nwas, how the pain made the joy sweeter. We can't remember what it was\r\nlike to work to earn our keep; to worry that there might not be\r\n_enough_, that we might get sick or get hit by a bus. We don't remember\r\nwhat it was like to take chances, and we sure as shit don't remember\r\nwhat it felt like to have them pay off.\"\r\n\r\nHe had a point. Here I was, only in my second or third adulthood, and\r\nalready ready to toss it all in and do something, _anything_, else. He\r\nhad a point -- but I wasn't about to admit it. \"So you say. I say, I\r\ntake a chance when I strike up a conversation in a bar, when I fall in\r\nlove. . . And what about the deadheads? Two people I know, they just\r\nwent deadhead for ten thousand years! Tell me that's not taking a\r\nchance!\" Truth be told, almost everyone I'd known in my eighty-some\r\nyears were deadheading or jaunting or just _gone_. Lonely days, then.\r\n\r\n\"Brother, that's committing half-assed suicide. The way we're going,\r\nthey'll be lucky if someone doesn't just switch 'em off when it comes\r\ntime to reanimate. In case you haven't noticed, it's getting a little\r\ncrowded around here.\"\r\n\r\nI made pish-tosh sounds and wiped off my forehead with a bar-napkin --\r\nthe Gazoo was beastly hot on summer nights. \"Uh-huh, just like the world\r\nwas getting a little crowded a hundred years ago, before Free Energy.\r\nLike it was getting too greenhousey, too nukey, too hot or too cold. We\r\nfixed it then, we'll fix it again when the time comes. I'm gonna be here\r\nin ten thousand years, you damn betcha, but I think I'll do it the long\r\nway around.\"\r\n\r\nHe cocked his head again, and gave it some thought. If it had been any\r\nof the other grad students, I'd have assumed he was grepping for some\r\nbolstering factoids to support his next sally. But with him, I just knew\r\nhe was thinking about it, the old-fashioned way.\r\n\r\n\"I think that if I'm still here in ten thousand years, I'm going to be\r\ncrazy as hell. Ten thousand years, pal! Ten thousand years ago, the\r\nstate-of-the-art was a goat. You really think you're going to be\r\nanything recognizably human in a hundred centuries? Me, I'm not\r\ninterested in being a post-person. I'm going to wake up one day, and I'm\r\ngoing to say, 'Well, I guess I've seen about enough,' and that'll be my\r\nlast day.\"\r\n\r\nI had seen where he was going with this, and I had stopped paying\r\nattention while I readied my response. I probably should have paid more\r\nattention. \"But why? Why not just deadhead for a few centuries, see if\r\nthere's anything that takes your fancy, and if not, back to sleep for a\r\nfew more? Why do anything so _final_?\"\r\n\r\nHe embarrassed me by making a show of thinking it over again, making me\r\nfeel like I was just a half-pissed glib poltroon. \"I suppose it's\r\nbecause nothing else is. I've always known that someday, I was going to\r\nstop moving, stop seeking, stop kicking, and have done with it. There'll\r\ncome a day when I don't have anything left to do, except stop.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nOn campus, they called him Keep-A-Movin' Dan, because of his cowboy vibe\r\nand because of his lifestyle, and he somehow grew to take over every\r\nconversation I had for the next six months. I pinged his Whuffie a few\r\ntimes, and noticed that it was climbing steadily upward as he\r\naccumulated more esteem from the people he met.\r\n\r\nI'd pretty much pissed away most of my Whuffie -- all the savings from\r\nthe symphonies and the first three theses -- drinking myself stupid at\r\nthe Gazoo, hogging library terminals, pestering profs, until I'd\r\nexpended all the respect anyone had ever afforded me. All except Dan,\r\nwho, for some reason, stood me to regular beers and meals and movies.\r\n\r\nI got to feeling like I was someone special -- not everyone had a chum\r\nas exotic as Keep-A-Movin' Dan, the legendary missionary who visited the\r\nonly places left that were closed to the Bitchun Society. I can't say\r\nfor sure why he hung around with me. He mentioned once or twice that\r\nhe'd liked my symphonies, and he'd read my Ergonomics thesis on applying\r\ntheme-park crowd-control techniques in urban settings, and liked what I\r\nhad to say there. But I think it came down to us having a good time\r\nneedling each other.\r\n\r\nI'd talk to him about the vast carpet of the future unrolling before us,\r\nof the certainty that we would encounter alien intelligences some day,\r\nof the unimaginable frontiers open to each of us. He'd tell me that\r\ndeadheading was a strong indicator that one's personal reservoir of\r\nintrospection and creativity was dry; and that without struggle, there\r\nis no real victory.\r\n\r\nThis was a good fight, one we could have a thousand times without\r\nresolving. I'd get him to concede that Whuffie recaptured the true\r\nessence of money: in the old days, if you were broke but respected, you\r\nwouldn't starve; contrariwise, if you were rich and hated, no sum could\r\nbuy you security and peace. By measuring the thing that money really\r\nrepresented -- your personal capital with your friends and neighbors --\r\nyou more accurately gauged your success.\r\n\r\nAnd then he'd lead me down a subtle, carefully baited trail that led to\r\nmy allowing that while, yes, we might someday encounter alien species\r\nwith wild and fabulous ways, that right now, there was a slightly\r\ndepressing homogeneity to the world.\r\n\r\nOn a fine spring day, I defended my thesis to two embodied humans and\r\none prof whose body was out for an overhaul, whose consciousness was\r\npresent via speakerphone from the computer where it was resting. They\r\nall liked it. I collected my sheepskin and went out hunting for Dan in\r\nthe sweet, flower-stinking streets.\r\n\r\nHe'd gone. The Anthro major he'd been torturing with his war-stories\r\nsaid that they'd wrapped up that morning, and he'd headed to the walled\r\ncity of Tijuana, to take his shot with the descendants of a platoon of\r\nUS Marines who'd settled there and cut themselves off from the Bitchun\r\nSociety.\r\n\r\nSo I went to Disney World.\r\n\r\nIn deference to Dan, I took the flight in realtime, in the minuscule\r\ncabin reserved for those of us who stubbornly refused to be frozen and\r\nstacked like cordwood for the two hour flight. I was the only one taking\r\nthe trip in realtime, but a flight attendant dutifully served me a\r\nurine-sample-sized orange juice and a rubbery, pungent, cheese omelet. I\r\nstared out the windows at the infinite clouds while the autopilot banked\r\naround the turbulence, and wondered when I'd see Dan next.\r\n\r\n========= CHAPTER 1 =========\r\n\r\nMy girlfriend was 15 percent of my age, and I was old-fashioned enough\r\nthat it bugged me. Her name was Lil, and she was second-generation\r\nDisney World, her parents being among the original ad-hocracy that took\r\nover the management of Liberty Square and Tom Sawyer Island. She was,\r\nquite literally, raised in Walt Disney World and it showed.\r\n\r\nIt showed. She was neat and efficient in her every little thing, from\r\nher shining red hair to her careful accounting of each gear and cog in\r\nthe animatronics that were in her charge. Her folks were in canopic jars\r\nin Kissimmee, deadheading for a few centuries.\r\n\r\nOn a muggy Wednesday, we dangled our feet over the edge of the Liberty\r\nBelle's riverboat pier, watching the listless Confederate flag over Fort\r\nLanghorn on Tom Sawyer Island by moonlight. The Magic Kingdom was all\r\nclosed up and every last guest had been chased out the gate underneath\r\nthe Main Street train station, and we were able to breathe a heavy sigh\r\nof relief, shuck parts of our costumes, and relax together while the\r\ncicadas sang.\r\n\r\nI was more than a century old, but there was still a kind of magic in\r\nhaving my arm around the warm, fine shoulders of a girl by moonlight,\r\nhidden from the hustle of the cleaning teams by the turnstiles,\r\nbreathing the warm, moist air. Lil plumped her head against my shoulder\r\nand gave me a butterfly kiss under my jaw.\r\n\r\n\"Her name was McGill,\" I sang, gently.\r\n\r\n\"But she called herself Lil,\" she sang, warm breath on my collarbones.\r\n\r\n\"And everyone knew her as Nancy,\" I sang.\r\n\r\nI'd been startled to know that she knew the Beatles. They'd been old\r\nnews in my youth, after all. But her parents had given her a thorough --\r\nif eclectic -- education.\r\n\r\n\"Want to do a walk-through?\" she asked. It was one of her favorite\r\nduties, exploring every inch of the rides in her care with the lights\r\non, after the horde of tourists had gone. We both liked to see the\r\nunderpinnings of the magic. Maybe that was why I kept picking at the\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n\"I'm a little pooped. Let's sit a while longer, if you don't mind.\"\r\n\r\nShe heaved a dramatic sigh. \"Oh, all right. Old man.\" She reached up and\r\ngently tweaked my nipple, and I gave a satisfying little jump. I think\r\nthe age difference bothered her, too, though she teased me for letting\r\nit get to me.\r\n\r\n\"I think I'll be able to manage a totter through the Haunted Mansion, if\r\nyou just give me a moment to rest my bursitis.\" I felt her smile against\r\nmy shirt. She loved the Mansion; loved to turn on the ballroom ghosts\r\nand dance their waltz with them on the dusty floor, loved to try and\r\nstare down the marble busts in the library that followed your gaze as\r\nyou passed.\r\n\r\nI liked it too, but I really liked just sitting there with her, watching\r\nthe water and the trees. I was just getting ready to go when I heard a\r\nsoft _ping_ inside my cochlea. \"Damn,\" I said. \"I've got a call.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell them you're busy,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" I said, and answered the call subvocally. \"Julius here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Julius. It's Dan. You got a minute?\"\r\n\r\nI knew a thousand Dans, but I recognized the voice immediately, though\r\nit'd been ten years since we last got drunk at the Gazoo together. I\r\nmuted the subvocal and said, \"Lil, I've got to take this. Do you mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, _no_, not at all,\" she sarcased at me. She sat up and pulled out\r\nher crack pipe and lit up.\r\n\r\n\"Dan,\" I subvocalized, \"long time no speak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, buddy, it sure has been,\" he said, and his voice cracked on a\r\nsob.\r\n\r\nI turned and gave Lil such a look, she dropped her pipe. \"How can I\r\nhelp?\" she said, softly but swiftly. I waved her off and switched the\r\nphone to full-vocal mode. My voice sounded unnaturally loud in the\r\ncricket-punctuated calm.\r\n\r\n\"Where you at, Dan?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Down here, in Orlando. I'm stuck out on Pleasure Island.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" I said. \"Meet me at, uh, the Adventurer's Club, upstairs on\r\nthe couch by the door. I'll be there in --\" I shot a look at Lil, who\r\nknew the castmember-only roads better than I. She flashed ten fingers at\r\nme. \"Ten minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"Sorry.\" He had his voice back under control. I\r\nswitched off.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" Lil asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not sure. An old friend is in town. He sounds like he's got a\r\nproblem.\"\r\n\r\nLil pointed a finger at me and made a trigger-squeezing gesture.\r\n\"There,\" she said. \"I've just dumped the best route to Pleasure Island\r\nto your public directory. Keep me in the loop, okay?\"\r\n\r\nI set off for the utilidoor entrance near the Hall of Presidents and\r\nbooted down the stairs to the hum of the underground tunnel-system. I\r\ntook the slidewalk to cast parking and zipped my little cart out to\r\nPleasure Island.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI found Dan sitting on the L-shaped couch underneath rows of faked-up\r\ntrophy shots with humorous captions. Downstairs, castmembers were\r\nworking the animatronic masks and idols, chattering with the guests.\r\n\r\nDan was apparent fifty plus, a little paunchy and stubbled. He had\r\nraccoon-mask bags under his eyes and he slumped listlessly. As I\r\napproached, I pinged his Whuffie and was startled to see that it had\r\ndropped to nearly zero.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus,\" I said, as I sat down next to him. \"You look like hell, Dan.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \"Appearances can be deceptive,\" he said. \"But in this case,\r\nthey're bang-on.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want to talk about it?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Somewhere else, huh? I hear they ring in the New Year every night at\r\nmidnight; I think that'd be a little too much for me right now.\"\r\n\r\nI led him out to my cart and cruised back to the place I shared with\r\nLil, out in Kissimmee. He smoked eight cigarettes on the twenty minute\r\nride, hammering one after another into his mouth, filling my runabout\r\nwith stinging clouds. I kept glancing at him in the rear-view. He had\r\nhis eyes closed, and in repose he looked dead. I could hardly believe\r\nthat this was my vibrant action-hero pal of yore.\r\n\r\nSurreptitiously, I called Lil's phone. \"I'm bringing him home,\" I\r\nsubvocalized. \"He's in rough shape. Not sure what it's all about.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll make up the couch,\" she said. \"And get some coffee together. Love\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Back atcha, kid,\" I said.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the tacky little swaybacked ranch-house, he opened his\r\neyes. \"You're a pal, Jules.\" I waved him off. \"No, really. I tried to\r\nthink of who I could call, and you were the only one. I've missed you,\r\nbud.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lil said she'd put some coffee on,\" I said. \"You sound like you need\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nLil was waiting on the sofa, a folded blanket and an extra pillow on the\r\nside table, a pot of coffee and some Disneyland Beijing mugs beside\r\nthem. She stood and extended her hand. \"I'm Lil,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Dan,\" he said. \"It's a pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nI knew she was pinging his Whuffie and I caught her look of surprised\r\ndisapproval. Us oldsters who predate Whuffie know that it's important;\r\nbut to the kids, it's the _world_. Someone without any is automatically\r\nsuspect. I watched her recover quickly, smile, and surreptitiously wipe\r\nher hand on her jeans. \"Coffee?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yeah,\" Dan said, and slumped on the sofa.\r\n\r\nShe poured him a cup and set it on a coaster on the coffee table. \"I'll\r\nlet you boys catch up, then,\" she said, and started for the bedroom.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Dan said. \"Wait. If you don't mind. I think it'd help if I could\r\ntalk to someone. . . younger, too.\"\r\n\r\nShe set her face in the look of chirpy helpfulness that all the second-\r\ngen castmembers have at their instant disposal and settled into an\r\narmchair. She pulled out her pipe and lit a rock. I went through my\r\ncrack period before she was born, just after they made it decaf, and I\r\nalways felt old when I saw her and her friends light up. Dan surprised\r\nme by holding out a hand to her and taking the pipe. He toked heavily,\r\nthen passed it back.\r\n\r\nDan closed his eyes again, then ground his fists into them, sipped his\r\ncoffee. It was clear he was trying to figure out where to start.\r\n\r\n\"I believed that I was braver than I really am, is what it boils down\r\nto,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Who doesn't?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I really thought I could do it. I knew that someday I'd run out of\r\nthings to do, things to see. I knew that I'd finish some day. You\r\nremember, we used to argue about it. I swore I'd be done, and that would\r\nbe the end of it. And now I am. There isn't a single place left on-world\r\nthat isn't part of the Bitchun Society. There isn't a single thing left\r\nthat I want any part of.\"\r\n\r\n\"So deadhead for a few centuries,\" I said. \"Put the decision off.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he shouted, startling both of us. \"I'm _done_. It's _over_.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do it,\" Lil said.\r\n\r\n\"I _can't_,\" he sobbed, and buried his face in his hands. He cried like\r\na baby, in great, snoring sobs that shook his whole body. Lil went into\r\nthe kitchen and got some tissue, and passed it to me. I sat alongside\r\nhim and awkwardly patted his back.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus,\" he said, into his palms. \"Jesus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dan?\" I said, quietly.\r\n\r\nHe sat up and took the tissue, wiped off his face and hands. \"Thanks,\"\r\nhe said. \"I've tried to make a go of it, really I have. I've spent the\r\nlast eight years in Istanbul, writing papers on my missions, about the\r\ncommunities. I did some followup studies, interviews. No one was\r\ninterested. Not even me. I smoked a lot of hash. It didn't help. So, one\r\nmorning I woke up and went to the bazaar and said good bye to the\r\nfriends I'd made there. Then I went to a pharmacy and had the man make\r\nme up a lethal injection. He wished me good luck and I went back to my\r\nrooms. I sat there with the hypo all afternoon, then I decided to sleep\r\non it, and I got up the next morning and did it all over again. I looked\r\ninside myself, and I saw that I didn't have the guts. I just didn't have\r\nthe guts. I've stared down the barrels of a hundred guns, had a thousand\r\nknives pressed up against my throat, but I didn't have the guts to press\r\nthat button.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were too late,\" Lil said.\r\n\r\nWe both turned to look at her.\r\n\r\n\"You were a decade too late. Look at you. You're pathetic. If you killed\r\nyourself right now, you'd just be a washed-up loser who couldn't hack\r\nit. If you'd done it ten years earlier, you would've been going out on\r\ntop -- a champion, retiring permanently.\" She set her mug down with a\r\nharder-than-necessary clunk.\r\n\r\nSometimes, Lil and I are right on the same wavelength. Sometimes, it's\r\nlike she's on a different planet. All I could do was sit there,\r\nhorrified, and she was happy to discuss the timing of my pal's suicide.\r\n\r\nBut she was right. Dan nodded heavily, and I saw that he knew it, too.\r\n\r\n\"A day late and a dollar short,\" he sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Well, don't just sit there,\" she said. \"You know what you've got to\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" I said, involuntarily irritated by her tone.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me like I was being deliberately stupid. \"He's got to get\r\nback on top. Cleaned up, dried out, into some productive work. Get that\r\nWhuffie up, too. _Then_ he can kill himself with dignity.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the stupidest thing I'd ever heard. Dan, though, was cocking an\r\neyebrow at her and thinking hard. \"How old did you say you were?\" he\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty-three,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Wish I'd had your smarts at twenty-three,\" he said, and heaved a sigh,\r\nstraightening up. \"Can I stay here while I get the job done?\"\r\n\r\nI looked askance at Lil, who considered for a moment, then nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Sure, pal, sure,\" I said. I clapped him on the shoulder. \"You look\r\nbeat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Beat doesn't begin to cover it,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Good night, then,\" I said.\r\n\r\n========= CHAPTER 2 =========\r\n\r\nAd-hocracy works well, for the most part. Lil's folks had taken over the\r\nrunning of Liberty Square with a group of other interested, compatible\r\nsouls. They did a fine job, racked up gobs of Whuffie, and anyone who\r\ncame around and tried to take it over would be so reviled by the guests\r\nthey wouldn't find a pot to piss in. Or they'd have such a wicked,\r\nradical approach that they'd ouster Lil's parents and their pals, and do\r\na better job.\r\n\r\nIt can break down, though. There were pretenders to the throne -- a\r\ngroup who'd worked with the original ad-hocracy and then had moved off\r\nto other pursuits -- some of them had gone to school, some of them had\r\nmade movies, written books, or gone off to Disneyland Beijing to help\r\nstart things up. A few had deadheaded for a couple decades.\r\n\r\nThey came back to Liberty Square with a message: update the attractions.\r\nThe Liberty Square ad-hocs were the staunchest conservatives in the\r\nMagic Kingdom, preserving the wheezing technology in the face of a Park\r\nthat changed almost daily. The newcomer/old-timers were on-side with the\r\nrest of the Park, had their support, and looked like they might make a\r\nsuccessful go of it.\r\n\r\nSo it fell to Lil to make sure that there were no bugs in the meager\r\nattractions of Liberty Square: the Hall of the Presidents, the Liberty\r\nBelle riverboat, and the glorious Haunted Mansion, arguably the coolest\r\nattraction to come from the fevered minds of the old-time Disney\r\nImagineers.\r\n\r\nI caught her backstage at the Hall of the Presidents, tinkering with\r\nLincoln II, the backup animatronic. Lil tried to keep two of everything\r\nrunning at speed, just in case. She could swap out a dead bot for a\r\nbackup in five minutes flat, which is all that crowd-control would\r\npermit.\r\n\r\nIt had been two weeks since Dan's arrival, and though I'd barely seen\r\nhim in that time, his presence was vivid in our lives. Our little ranch-\r\nhouse had a new smell, not unpleasant, of rejuve and hope and loss,\r\nsomething barely noticeable over the tropical flowers nodding in front\r\nof our porch. My phone rang three or four times a day, Dan checking in\r\nfrom his rounds of the Park, seeking out some way to accumulate personal\r\ncapital. His excitement and dedication to the task were inspiring,\r\npulling me into his over-the-top-and-damn-the-torpedoes mode of being.\r\n\r\n\"You just missed Dan,\" she said. She had her head in Lincoln's chest,\r\nworking with an autosolder and a magnifier. Bent over, red hair tied\r\nback in a neat bun, sweat sheening her wiry freckled arms, smelling of\r\ngirl-sweat and machine lubricant, she made me wish there were a mattress\r\nsomewhere backstage. I settled for patting her behind affectionately,\r\nand she wriggled appreciatively. \"He's looking better.\"\r\n\r\nHis rejuve had taken him back to apparent 25, the way I remembered him.\r\nHe was rawboned and leathery, but still had the defeated stoop that had\r\nstartled me when I saw him at the Adventurer's Club. \"What did he want?\"\r\n\r\n\"He's been hanging out with Debra -- he wanted to make sure I knew what\r\nshe's up to.\"\r\n\r\nDebra was one of the old guard, a former comrade of Lil's parents. She'd\r\nspent a decade in Disneyland Beijing, coding sim-rides. If she had her\r\nway, we'd tear down every marvelous rube goldberg in the Park and\r\nreplace them with pristine white sim boxes on giant, articulated servos.\r\n\r\nThe problem was that she was _really good_ at coding sims. Her Great\r\nMovie Ride rehab at MGM was breathtaking -- the Star Wars sequence had\r\nalready inspired a hundred fan-sites that fielded millions of hits.\r\n\r\nShe'd leveraged her success into a deal with the Adventureland ad-hocs\r\nto rehab the Pirates of the Caribbean, and their backstage areas were\r\npiled high with reference: treasure chests and cutlasses and bowsprits.\r\nIt was terrifying to walk through; the Pirates was the last ride Walt\r\npersonally supervised, and we'd thought it was sacrosanct. But Debra had\r\nbuilt a Pirates sim in Beijing, based on Chend I Sao, the XIXth century\r\nChinese pirate queen, which was credited with rescuing the Park from\r\nobscurity and ruin. The Florida iteration would incorporate the best\r\naspects of its Chinese cousin -- the AI-driven sims that communicated\r\nwith each other and with the guests, greeting them by name each time\r\nthey rode and spinning age-appropriate tales of piracy on the high seas;\r\nthe spectacular fly-through of the aquatic necropolis of rotting junks\r\non the sea-floor; the thrilling pitch and yaw of the sim as it weathered\r\na violent, breath-taking storm -- but with Western themes: wafts of\r\nJamaican pepper sauce crackling through the air; liquid Afro-Caribbean\r\naccents; and swordfights conducted in the manner of the pirates who\r\nplied the blue waters of the New World. Identical sims would stack like\r\ncordwood in the space currently occupied by the bulky ride-apparatus and\r\ndioramas, quintupling capacity and halving load-time.\r\n\r\n\"So, what's she up to?\"\r\n\r\nLil extracted herself from the Rail-Splitter's mechanical guts and made\r\na comical moue of worry. \"She's rehabbing the Pirates -- and doing an\r\nincredible job. They're ahead of schedule, they've got good net-buzz,\r\nthe focus groups are cumming themselves.\" The comedy went out of her\r\nexpression, baring genuine worry.\r\n\r\nShe turned away and closed up Honest Abe, then fired her finger at him.\r\nSmoothly, he began to run through his spiel, silent but for the soft hum\r\nand whine of his servos. Lil mimed twiddling a knob and his audiotrack\r\nkicked in low: \"All the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa _combined_\r\ncould not, by force, make a track on the Blue Ridge, nor take a drink\r\nfrom the Ohio. If destruction be our lot, then we ourselves must be its\r\nauthor -- and its finisher.\" She mimed turning down the gain and he fell\r\nsilent again.\r\n\r\n\"You said it, Mr. President,\" she said, and fired her finger at him\r\nagain, powering him down. She bent and adjusted his hand-sewn period\r\ntopcoat, then carefully wound and set the turnip-watch in his vest-\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nI put my arm around her shoulders. \"You're doing all you can -- and it's\r\ngood work,\" I said. I'd fallen into the easy castmember mode of\r\nspeaking, voicing bland affirmations. Hearing the words, I felt a flush\r\nof embarrassment. I pulled her into a long, hard hug and fumbled for\r\nbetter reassurance. Finding no words that would do, I gave her a final\r\nsqueeze and let her go.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me sidelong and nodded her head. \"It'll be fine, of\r\ncourse,\" she said. \"I mean, the worst possible scenario is that Debra\r\nwill do her job very, very well, and make things even better than they\r\nare now. That's not so bad.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a 180-degree reversal of her position on the subject the last\r\ntime we'd talked, but you don't live more than a century without\r\nlearning when to point out that sort of thing and when not to.\r\n\r\nMy cochlea struck twelve noon and a HUD appeared with my weekly backup\r\nreminder. Lil was maneuvering Ben Franklin II out of his niche. I waved\r\ngood-bye at her back and walked away, to an uplink terminal. Once I was\r\nclose enough for secure broadband communications, I got ready to back\r\nup. My cochlea chimed again and I answered it.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I subvocalized, impatiently. I hated getting distracted from a\r\nbackup -- one of my enduring fears was that I'd forget the backup\r\naltogether and leave myself vulnerable for an entire week until the next\r\nreminder. I'd lost the knack of getting into habits in my adolescence,\r\ngiving in completely to machine-generated reminders over conscious\r\nchoice.\r\n\r\n\"It's Dan.\" I heard the sound of the Park in full swing behind him --\r\nchildren's laughter; bright, recorded animatronic spiels; the tromp of\r\nthousands of feet. \"Can you meet me at the Tiki Room? It's pretty\r\nimportant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can it wait for fifteen?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Sure -- see you in fifteen.\"\r\n\r\nI rung off and initiated the backup. A status-bar zipped across a HUD,\r\ndumping the parts of my memory that were purely digital; then it\r\nfinished and started in on organic memory. My eyes rolled back in my\r\nhead and my life flashed before my eyes.\r\n\r\n========= CHAPTER 3 =========\r\n\r\nThe Bitchun Society has had much experience with restores from backup --\r\nin the era of the cure for death, people live pretty recklessly. Some\r\npeople get refreshed a couple dozen times a year.\r\n\r\nNot me. I hate the process. Not so much that I won't participate in it.\r\nEveryone who had serious philosophical conundra on that subject just,\r\nyou know, _died_, a generation before. The Bitchun Society didn't need\r\nto convert its detractors, just outlive them.\r\n\r\nThe first time I died, it was not long after my sixtieth birthday. I was\r\nSCUBA diving at Playa Coral, near Veradero, Cuba. Of course, I don't\r\nremember the incident, but knowing my habits at that particular dive-\r\nsite and having read the dive-logs of my SCUBA-buddies, I've\r\nreconstructed the events.\r\n\r\nI was eeling my way through the lobster-caves, with a borrowed bottle\r\nand mask. I'd also borrowed a wetsuit, but I wasn't wearing it -- the\r\nblood-temp salt water was balm, and I hated erecting barriers between it\r\nand my skin. The caves were made of coral and rocks, and they coiled and\r\ntwisted like intestines. Through each hole and around each corner, there\r\nwas a hollow, rough sphere of surpassing, alien beauty. Giant lobsters\r\nskittered over the walls and through the holes. Schools of fish as\r\nbright as jewels darted and executed breath-taking precision maneuvers\r\nas I disturbed their busy days. I do some of my best thinking under\r\nwater, and I'm often slipping off into dangerous reverie at depth.\r\nNormally, my diving buddies ensure that I don't hurt myself, but this\r\ntime I got away from them, spidering forward into a tiny hole.\r\n\r\nWhere I got stuck.\r\n\r\nMy diving buddies were behind me, and I rapped on my bottle with the\r\nhilt of my knife until one of them put a hand on my shoulder. My buddies\r\nsaw what was up, and attempted to pull me loose, but my bottle and\r\nbuoyancy-control vest were firmly wedged. The others exchanged hand\r\nsignals, silently debating the best way to get me loose. Suddenly, I was\r\nthrashing and kicking, and then I disappeared into the cave, minus my\r\nvest and bottle. I'd apparently attempted to cut through my vest's\r\nstraps and managed to sever the tube of my regulator. After inhaling a\r\njolt of sea water, I'd thrashed free into the cave, rolling into a\r\nmonstrous patch of spindly fire-coral. I'd inhaled another lungful of\r\nwater and kicked madly for a tiny hole in the cave's ceiling, whence my\r\nbuddies retrieved me shortly thereafter, drowned-blue except for the\r\npatchy red welts from the stinging coral.\r\n\r\nIn those days, making a backup was a lot more complicated; the procedure\r\ntook most of a day, and had to be undertaken at a special clinic.\r\nLuckily, I'd had one made just before I left for Cuba, a few weeks\r\nearlier. My next-most-recent backup was three years old, dating from the\r\ncompletion of my second symphony.\r\n\r\nThey recovered me from backup and into a force-grown clone at Toronto\r\nGeneral. As far as I knew, I'd laid down in the backup clinic one moment\r\nand arisen the next. It took most of a year to get over the feeling that\r\nthe whole world was putting a monstrous joke over on me, that the\r\ndrowned corpse I'd seen was indeed my own. In my mind, the rebirth was\r\nfigurative as well as literal -- the missing time was enough that I\r\nfound myself hard-pressed to socialize with my pre-death friends.\r\n\r\nI told Dan the story during our first friendship, and he immediately\r\npounced on the fact that I'd gone to Disney World to spend a week\r\nsorting out my feelings, reinventing myself, moving to space, marrying a\r\ncrazy lady. He found it very curious that I always rebooted myself at\r\nDisney World. When I told him that I was going to live there someday, he\r\nasked me if that would mean that I was done reinventing myself.\r\nSometimes, as I ran my fingers through Lil's sweet red curls, I thought\r\nof that remark and sighed great gusts of contentment and marveled that\r\nmy friend Dan had been so prescient.\r\n\r\nThe next time I died, they'd improved the technology somewhat. I'd had a\r\nmassive stroke in my seventy-third year, collapsing on the ice in the\r\nmiddle of a house-league hockey game. By the time they cut my helmet\r\naway, the hematomae had crushed my brain into a pulpy, blood-sotted\r\nmess. I'd been lax in backing up, and I lost most of a year. But they\r\nwoke me gently, with a computer-generated precis of the events of the\r\nmissing interval, and a counselor contacted me daily for a year until I\r\nfelt at home again in my skin. Again, my life rebooted, and I found\r\nmyself in Disney World, methodically flensing away the relationships I'd\r\nbuilt and starting afresh in Boston, living on the ocean floor and\r\nworking the heavy-metal harvesters, a project that led, eventually, to\r\nmy Chem thesis at U of T.\r\n\r\nAfter I was shot dead at the Tiki Room, I had the opportunity to\r\nappreciate the great leaps that restores had made in the intervening ten\r\nyears. I woke in my own bed, instantly aware of the events that led up\r\nto my third death as seen from various third-party POVs: security\r\nfootage from the Adventureland cameras, synthesized memories extracted\r\nfrom Dan's own backup, and a computer-generated fly-through of the\r\nscene. I woke feeling preternaturally calm and cheerful, and knowing\r\nthat I felt that way because of certain temporary neurotransmitter\r\npresets that had been put in place when I was restored.\r\n\r\nDan and Lil sat at my bedside. Lil's tired, smiling face was limned with\r\nhairs that had snuck loose of her ponytail. She took my hand and kissed\r\nthe smooth knuckles. Dan smiled beneficently at me and I was seized with\r\na warm, comforting feeling of being surrounded by people who really\r\nloved me. I dug for words appropriate to the scene, decided to wing it,\r\nopened my mouth and said, to my surprise, \"I have to pee.\"\r\n\r\nDan and Lil smiled at each other. I lurched out of the bed, naked, and\r\nthumped to the bathroom. My muscles were wonderfully limber, with a\r\nbrand-new spring to them. After I flushed I leaned over and took hold of\r\nmy ankles, then pulled my head right to the floor, feeling the marvelous\r\nflexibility of my back and legs and buttocks. A scar on my knee was\r\nmissing, as were the many lines that had crisscrossed my fingers. When I\r\nlooked in the mirror, I saw that my nose and earlobes were smaller and\r\nperkier. The familiar crow's-feet and the frown-lines between my\r\neyebrows were gone. I had a day's beard all over -- head, face, pubis,\r\narms, legs. I ran my hands over my body and chuckled at the ticklish\r\nnewness of it all. I was briefly tempted to depilate all over, just to\r\nkeep this feeling of newness forever, but the neurotransmitter presets\r\nwere evaporating and a sense of urgency over my murder was creeping up\r\non me.\r\n\r\nI tied a towel around my waist and made my way back to the bedroom. The\r\nsmells of tile-cleaner and flowers and rejuve were bright in my nose,\r\neffervescent as camphor. Dan and Lil stood when I came into the room and\r\nhelped me to the bed. \"Well, this _sucks_,\" I said.\r\n\r\nI'd gone straight from the uplink through the utilidors -- three quick\r\ncuts of security cam footage, one at the uplink, one in the corridor,\r\nand one at the exit in the underpass between Liberty Square and\r\nAdventureland. I seemed bemused and a little sad as I emerged from the\r\ndoor, and began to weave my way through the crowd, using a kind of\r\nsinuous, darting shuffle that I'd developed when I was doing field-work\r\non my crowd-control thesis. I cut rapidly through the lunchtime crowd\r\ntoward the long roof of the Tiki Room, thatched with strips of\r\nshimmering aluminum cut and painted to look like long grass.\r\n\r\nFuzzy shots now, from Dan's POV, of me moving closer to him, passing\r\nclose to a group of teenaged girls with extra elbows and knees, wearing\r\nenvironmentally controlled cloaks and cowls covered with Epcot Center\r\nlogomarks. One of them is wearing a pith helmet, from the Jungle Traders\r\nshop outside of the Jungle Cruise. Dan's gaze flicks away, to the Tiki\r\nRoom's entrance, where there is a short queue of older men, then back,\r\njust as the girl with the pith helmet draws a stylish little organic\r\npistol, like a penis with a tail that coils around her arm. Casually,\r\ngrinning, she raises her arm and gestures with the pistol, exactly like\r\nLil does with her finger when she's uploading, and the pistol lunges\r\nforward. Dan's gaze flicks back to me. I'm pitching over, my lungs\r\nbursting out of my chest and spreading before me like wings, spinal\r\ngristle and viscera showering the guests before me. A piece of my\r\nnametag, now shrapnel, strikes Dan in the forehead, causing him to\r\nblink. When he looks again, the group of girls is still there, but the\r\ngirl with the pistol is long gone.\r\n\r\nThe fly-through is far less confused. Everyone except me, Dan and the\r\ngirl is grayed-out. We're limned in highlighter yellow, moving in slow-\r\nmotion. I emerge from the underpass and the girl moves from the Swiss\r\nFamily Robinson Treehouse to the group of her friends. Dan starts to\r\nmove towards me. The girl raises, arms and fires her pistol. The self-\r\nguiding smart-slug, keyed to my body chemistry, flies low, near ground\r\nlevel, weaving between the feet of the crowd, moving just below the\r\nspeed of sound. When it reaches me, it screams upwards and into my\r\nspine, detonating once it's entered my chest cavity.\r\n\r\nThe girl has already made a lot of ground, back toward the\r\nAdventureland/Main Street, USA gateway. The fly-through speeds up,\r\nfollowing her as she merges with the crowds on the street, ducking and\r\nweaving between them, moving toward the breezeway at Sleeping Beauty\r\nCastle. She vanishes, then reappears, forty minutes later, in\r\nTomorrowland, near the new Space Mountain complex, then disappears\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"Has anyone ID'd the girl?\" I asked, once I'd finished reliving the\r\nevents. The anger was starting to boil within me now. My new fists\r\nclenched for the first time, soft palms and uncallused fingertips.\r\n\r\nDan shook his head. \"None of the girls she was with had ever seen her\r\nbefore. The face was one of the Seven Sisters -- Hope.\" The Seven\r\nSisters were a trendy collection of designer faces. Every second teenage\r\ngirl wore one of them.\r\n\r\n\"How about Jungle Traders?\" I asked. \"Did they have a record of the pith\r\nhelmet purchase?\"\r\n\r\nLil frowned. \"We ran the Jungle Traders purchases back for six months:\r\nonly three matched the girl's apparent age; all three have alibis.\r\nChances are she stole it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" I asked, finally. In my mind's eye, I saw my lungs bursting out\r\nof my chest, like wings, like jellyfish, vertebrae spraying like\r\nshrapnel. I saw the girl's smile, an almost sexual smirk as she pulled\r\nthe trigger on me.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't random,\" Lil said. \"The slug was definitely keyed to you --\r\nthat means that she'd gotten close to you at some point.\"\r\n\r\nRight -- which meant that she'd been to Disney World in the last ten\r\nyears. That narrowed it down, all right.\r\n\r\n\"What happened to her after Tomorrowland?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"We don't know,\" Lil said. \"Something wrong with the cameras. We lost\r\nher and she never reappeared.\" She sounded hot and angry -- she took\r\nequipment failures in the Magic Kingdom personally.\r\n\r\n\"Who'd want to do this?\" I asked, hating the self-pity in my voice. It\r\nwas the first time I'd been murdered, but I didn't need to be a drama-\r\nqueen about it.\r\n\r\nDan's eyes got a far-away look. \"Sometimes, people do things for reasons\r\nthat seem perfectly reasonable to them, that the rest of the world\r\ncouldn't hope to understand. I've seen a few assassinations, and they\r\nnever made sense afterwards.\" He stroked his chin. \"Sometimes, it's\r\nbetter to look for temperament, rather than motivation: who _could_ do\r\nsomething like this?\"\r\n\r\nRight. All we needed to do was investigate all the psychopaths who'd\r\nvisited the Magic Kingdom in ten years. That narrowed it down\r\nconsiderably. I pulled up a HUD and checked the time. It had been four\r\ndays since my murder. I had a shift coming up, working the turnstiles at\r\nthe Haunted Mansion. I liked to pull a couple of those shifts a month,\r\njust to keep myself grounded; it helped to take a reality check while I\r\nwas churning away in the rarified climate of my crowd-control\r\nsimulations.\r\n\r\nI stood and went to my closet, started to dress.\r\n\r\n\"_What_ are you doing?\" Lil asked, alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"I've got a shift. I'm running late.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're in no shape to work,\" Lil said, tugging at my elbow. I jerked\r\nfree of her.\r\n\r\n\"I'm fine -- good as new.\" I barked a humorless laugh. \"I'm not going to\r\nlet those bastards disrupt my life any more.\"\r\n\r\n_Those bastards_? I thought -- when had I decided that there was more\r\nthan one? But I knew it was true. There was no way that this was all\r\nplanned by one person: it had been executed too precisely, too\r\nthoroughly.\r\n\r\nDan moved to block the bedroom door. \"Wait a second,\" he said. \"You need\r\nrest.\"\r\n\r\nI fixed him with a doleful glare. \"I'll decide that,\" I said. He stepped\r\naside.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tag along, then,\" he said. \"Just in case.\"\r\n\r\nI pinged my Whuffie. I was up a couple percentiles -- sympathy Whuffie\r\n-- but it was falling: Dan and Lil were radiating disapproval. Screw 'em.\r\n\r\nI got into my runabout and Dan scrambled for the passenger door as I put\r\nit in gear and sped out.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure you're all right?\" Dan said as I nearly rolled the\r\nrunabout taking the corner at the end of our cul-de-sac.\r\n\r\n\"Why wouldn't I be?\" I said. \"I'm as good as new.\"\r\n\r\n\"Funny choice of words,\" he said. \"Some would say that you _were_ new.\"\r\n\r\nI groaned. \"Not this argument again,\" I said. \"I feel like me and no one\r\nelse is making that claim. Who cares if I've been restored from a\r\nbackup?\"\r\n\r\n\"All I'm saying is, there's a difference between _you_ and an exact copy\r\nof you, isn't there?\"\r\n\r\nI knew what he was doing, distracting me with one of our old fights, but\r\nI couldn't resist the bait, and as I marshalled my arguments, it\r\nactually helped calm me down some. Dan was that kind of friend, a person\r\nwho knew you better than you knew yourself. \"So you're saying that if\r\nyou were obliterated and then recreated, atom-for-atom, that you\r\nwouldn't be you anymore?\"\r\n\r\n\"For the sake of argument, sure. Being destroyed and recreated is\r\ndifferent from not being destroyed at all, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brush up on your quantum mechanics, pal. You're being destroyed and\r\nrecreated a trillion times a second.\"\r\n\r\n\"On a very, very small level --\"\r\n\r\n\"What difference does that make?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fine, I'll concede that. But you're not really an atom-for-atom copy.\r\nYou're a clone, with a copied _brain_ -- that's not the same as quantum\r\ndestruction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very nice thing to say to someone who's just been murdered, pal. You\r\ngot a problem with clones?\"\r\n\r\nAnd we were off and running.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe Mansion's cast were sickeningly cheerful and solicitous. Each of\r\nthem made a point of coming around and touching the stiff, starched\r\nshoulder of my butler's costume, letting me know that if there was\r\nanything they could do for me. . . I gave them all a fixed smile and\r\ntried to concentrate on the guests, how they waited, when they arrived,\r\nhow they dispersed through the exit gate. Dan hovered nearby,\r\noccasionally taking the eight minute, twenty-two second ride-through,\r\nrunning interference for me with the other castmembers.\r\n\r\nHe was nearby when my break came up. I changed into civvies and we\r\nwalked over the cobbled streets, past the Hall of the Presidents, noting\r\nas I rounded the corner that there was something different about the\r\nqueue-area. Dan groaned. \"They did it already,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI looked closer. The turnstiles were blocked by a sandwich board: Mickey\r\nin a Ben Franklin wig and bifocals, holding a trowel. \"Excuse our mess!\"\r\nthe sign declared. \"We're renovating to serve you better!\"\r\n\r\nI spotted one of Debra's cronies standing behind the sign, a self-\r\nsatisfied smile on his face. He'd started off life as a squat, northern\r\nChinese, but had had his bones lengthened and his cheekbones raised so\r\nthat he looked almost elfin. I took one look at his smile and understood\r\n-- Debra had established a toehold in Liberty Square.\r\n\r\n\"They filed plans for the new Hall with the steering committee an hour\r\nafter you got shot. The committee loved the plans; so did the net.\r\nThey're promising not to touch the Mansion.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't mention this,\" I said, hotly.\r\n\r\n\"We thought you'd jump to conclusions. The timing was bad, but there's\r\nno indication that they arranged for the shooter. Everyone's got an\r\nalibi; furthermore, they've all offered to submit their backups for\r\nproof.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" I said. \"Right. So they just _happened_ to have plans for a new\r\nHall standing by. And they just _happened_ to file them after I got\r\nshot, when all our ad-hocs were busy worrying about me. It's all a big\r\ncoincidence.\"\r\n\r\nDan shook his head. \"We're not stupid, Jules. No one thinks that it's a\r\ncoincidence. Debra's the sort of person who keeps a lot of plans\r\nstanding by, just in case. But that just makes her a well-prepared\r\nopportunist, not a murderer.\"\r\n\r\nI felt nauseated and exhausted. I was enough of a castmember that I\r\nsought out a utilidor before I collapsed against a wall, head down.\r\nDefeat seeped through me, saturating me.\r\n\r\nDan crouched down beside me. I looked over at him. He was grinning\r\nwryly. \"Posit,\" he said, \"for the moment, that Debra really did do this\r\nthing, set you up so that she could take over.\"\r\n\r\nI smiled, in spite of myself. This was his explaining act, the thing he\r\nwould do whenever I fell into one of his rhetorical tricks back in the\r\nold days. \"All right, I've posited it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why would she: one, take out you instead of Lil or one of the real old-\r\ntimers; two, go after the Hall of Presidents instead of Tom Sawyer\r\nIsland or even the Mansion; and three, follow it up with such a blatant,\r\nsuspicious move?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" I said, warming to the challenge. \"One: I'm important\r\nenough to be disruptive but not so important as to rate a full\r\ninvestigation. Two: Tom Sawyer Island is too visible, you can't rehab it\r\nwithout people seeing the dust from shore. Three, Debra's coming off of\r\na decade in Beijing, where subtlety isn't real important.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Dan said, \"sure.\" Then he launched an answering salvo, and while\r\nI was thinking up my answer, he helped me to my feet and walked me out\r\nto my runabout, arguing all the way, so that by the time I noticed we\r\nweren't at the Park anymore, I was home and in bed.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nWith all the Hall's animatronics mothballed for the duration, Lil had\r\nmore time on her hands than she knew what to do with. She hung around\r\nthe little bungalow, the two of us in the living room, staring blankly\r\nat the windows, breathing shallowly in the claustrophobic, superheated\r\nFlorida air. I had my working notes on queue management for the Mansion,\r\nand I pecked at them aimlessly. Sometimes, Lil mirrored my HUD so she\r\ncould watch me work, and made suggestions based on her long experience.\r\n\r\nIt was a delicate process, this business of increasing throughput\r\nwithout harming the guest experience. But for every second I could shave\r\noff of the queue-to-exit time, I could put another sixty guests through\r\nand lop thirty seconds off total wait-time. And the more guests who got\r\nto experience the Mansion, the more of a Whuffie-hit Debra's people\r\nwould suffer if they made a move on it. So I dutifully pecked at my\r\nnotes, and found three seconds I could shave off the graveyard sequence\r\nby swiveling the Doom Buggy carriages stage-left as they descended from\r\nthe attic window: by expanding their fields-of-vision, I could expose\r\nthe guests to all the scenes more quickly.\r\n\r\nI ran the change in fly-through, then implemented it after closing and\r\ninvited the other Liberty Square ad-hocs to come and test it out.\r\n\r\nIt was another muggy winter evening, prematurely dark. The ad-hocs had\r\nenough friends and family with them that we were able to simulate an\r\noff-peak queue-time, and we all stood and sweated in the preshow area,\r\nwaiting for the doors to swing open, listening to the wolf-cries and\r\nassorted boo-spookery from the hidden speakers.\r\n\r\nThe doors swung open, revealing Lil in a rotting maid's uniform, her\r\neyes lined with black, her skin powdered to a deathly pallor. She gave\r\nus a cold, considering glare, then intoned, \"Master Gracey requests more\r\nbodies.\"\r\n\r\nAs we crowded into the cool, musty gloom of the parlor, Lil contrived to\r\ngive my ass an affectionate squeeze. I turned to return the favor, and\r\nsaw Debra's elfin comrade looming over Lil's shoulder. My smile died on\r\nmy lips.\r\n\r\nThe man locked eyes with me for a moment, and I saw something in there\r\n-- some admixture of cruelty and worry that I didn't know what to make\r\nof. He looked away immediately. I'd known that Debra would have spies in\r\nthe crowd, of course, but with elf-boy watching, I resolved to make this\r\nthe best show I knew how.\r\n\r\nIt's subtle, this business of making the show better from within. Lil\r\nhad already slid aside the paneled wall that led to stretch-room number\r\ntwo, the most recently serviced one. Once the crowd had moved inside, I\r\ntried to lead their eyes by adjusting my body language to poses of\r\nsubtle attention directed at the new spotlights. When the newly\r\nremastered soundtrack came from behind the sconce-bearing gargoyles at\r\nthe corners of the octagonal room, I leaned my body slightly in the\r\ndirection of the moving stereo-image. And an instant before the lights\r\nsnapped out, I ostentatiously cast my eyes up into the scrim ceiling,\r\nnoting that others had taken my cue, so they were watching when the\r\nUV-lit corpse dropped from the pitch-dark ceiling, jerking against the\r\nnoose at its neck.\r\n\r\nThe crowd filed into the second queue area, where they boarded the Doom\r\nBuggies. There was a low buzz of marveling conversation as we made our\r\nway onto the moving sidewalk. I boarded my Doom Buggy and an instant\r\nlater, someone slid in beside me. It was the elf.\r\n\r\nHe made a point of not making eye contact with me, but I sensed his\r\nsidelong glances at me as we rode through past the floating chandelier\r\nand into the corridor where the portraits' eyes watched us. Two years\r\nbefore, I'd accelerated this sequence and added some random swivel to\r\nthe Doom Buggies, shaving 25 seconds off the total, taking the hourly\r\nthroughput cap from 2365 to 2600. It was the proof-of-concept that led\r\nto all the other seconds I'd shaved away since. The violent pitching of\r\nthe Buggy brought me and the elf into inadvertent contact with one\r\nanother, and when I brushed his hand as I reached for the safety bar, I\r\nfelt that it was cold and sweaty.\r\n\r\nHe was nervous! _He_ was nervous. What did _he_ have to be nervous\r\nabout? I was the one who'd been murdered -- maybe he was nervous because\r\nhe was supposed to finish the job. I cast my own sidelong looks at him,\r\ntrying to see suspicious bulges in his tight clothes, but the Doom\r\nBuggy's pebbled black plastic interior was too dim. Dan was in the Buggy\r\nbehind us, with one of the Mansion's regular castmembers. I rang his\r\ncochlea and subvocalized: \"Get ready to jump out on my signal.\" Anyone\r\nleaving their Buggy would interrupt an infrared beam and stop the ride\r\nsystem. I knew I could rely on Dan to trust me without a lot of\r\nexplaining, which meant that I could keep a close watch on Debra's\r\ncrony.\r\n\r\nWe went past the hallway of mirrors and into the hallway of doors, where\r\nmonstrous hands peeked out around the sills, straining against the\r\nhinges, recorded groans mixed in with pounding. I thought about it -- if\r\nI wanted to kill someone on the Mansion, what would be the best place to\r\ndo it? The attic staircase-- the next sequence -- seemed like a good\r\nbet. A cold clarity washed over me. The elf would kill me in the gloom\r\nof the staircase, dump me out over the edge at the blind turn toward the\r\ngraveyard, and that would be it. Would he be able to do it if I were\r\nstaring straight at him? He seemed terribly nervous as it was. I\r\nswiveled in my seat and looked him straight in the eye.\r\n\r\nHe quirked half a smile at me and nodded a greeting. I kept on staring\r\nat him, my hands balled into fists, ready for anything. We rode down the\r\nstaircase, facing up, listening to the clamour of voices from the\r\ncemetery and the squawk of the red-eyed raven. I caught sight of the\r\nquaking groundkeeper animatronic from the corner of my eye and startled.\r\nI let out a subvocal squeal and was pitched forward as the ride system\r\nshuddered to a stop.\r\n\r\n\"Jules?\" came Dan's voice in my cochlea. \"You all right?\"\r\n\r\nHe'd heard my involuntary note of surprise and had leapt clear of the\r\nBuggy, stopping the ride. The elf was looking at me with a mixture of\r\nsurprise and pity.\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, it's all right. False alarm.\" I paged Lil and\r\nsubvocalized to her, telling her to start up the ride ASAP, it was all\r\nright.\r\n\r\nI rode the rest of the way with my hands on the safety bar, my eyes\r\nfixed ahead of me, steadfastly ignoring the elf. I checked the timer I'd\r\nbeen running. The demo was a debacle -- instead of shaving off three\r\nseconds, I'd added thirty. I wanted to cry.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI debarked the Buggy and stalked quickly out of the exit queue, leaning\r\nheavily against the fence, staring blindly at the pet cemetery. My head\r\nswam: I was out of control, jumping at shadows. I was spooked.\r\n\r\nAnd I had no reason to be. Sure, I'd been murdered, but what had it cost\r\nme? A few days of \"unconsciousness\" while they decanted my backup into\r\nmy new body, a merciful gap in memory from my departure at the backup\r\nterminal up until my death. I wasn't one of those nuts who took death\r\n_seriously_. It wasn't like they'd done something _permanent_.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I _had_ done something permanent: I'd dug Lil's grave a\r\nlittle deeper, endangered the ad-hocracy and, worst of all, the Mansion.\r\nI'd acted like an idiot. I tasted my dinner, a wolfed-down hamburger,\r\nand swallowed hard, forcing down the knob of nausea.\r\n\r\nI sensed someone at my elbow, and thinking it was Lil, come to ask me\r\nwhat had gone on, I turned with a sheepish grin and found myself facing\r\nthe elf.\r\n\r\nHe stuck his hand out and spoke in the flat no-accent of someone running\r\na language module. \"Hi there. We haven't been introduced, but I wanted\r\nto tell you how much I enjoy your work. I'm Tim Fung.\"\r\n\r\nI pumped his hand, which was still cold and particularly clammy in the\r\nclose heat of the Florida night. \"Julius,\" I said, startled at how much\r\nlike a bark it sounded. _Careful_, I thought, _no need to escalate the\r\nhostilities._ \"It's kind of you to say that. I like what you-all have\r\ndone with the Pirates.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled: a genuine, embarrassed smile, as though he'd just been given\r\nhigh praise from one of his heroes. \"Really? I think it's pretty good --\r\nthe second time around you get a lot of chances to refine things, really\r\nclarify the vision. Beijing -- well, it was exciting, but it was rushed,\r\nyou know? I mean, we were really struggling. Every day, there was\r\nanother pack of squatters who wanted to tear the Park down. Debra used\r\nto send me out to give the children piggyback rides, just to keep our\r\nWhuffie up while she was evicting the squatters. It was good to have the\r\nopportunity to refine the designs, revisit them without the floor show.\"\r\n\r\nI knew about this, of course -- Beijing had been a real struggle for the\r\nad-hocs who built it. Lots of them had been killed, many times over.\r\nDebra herself had been killed every day for a week and restored to a\r\nseries of prepared clones, beta-testing one of the ride systems. It was\r\nfaster than revising the CAD simulations. Debra had a reputation for\r\npursuing expedience.\r\n\r\n\"I'm starting to find out how it feels to work under pressure,\" I said,\r\nand nodded significantly at the Mansion. I was gratified to see him look\r\nembarrassed, then horrified.\r\n\r\n\"We would _never_ touch the Mansion,\" he said. \"It's _perfect_!\"\r\n\r\nDan and Lil sauntered up as I was preparing a riposte. They both looked\r\nconcerned -- now that I thought of it, they'd both seemed incredibly\r\nconcerned about me since the day I was revived.\r\n\r\nDan's gait was odd, stilted, like he was leaning on Lil for support.\r\nThey looked like a couple. An irrational sear of jealousy jetted through\r\nme. I was an emotional wreck. Still, I took Lil's big, scarred hand in\r\nmine as soon as she was in reach, then cuddled her to me protectively.\r\nShe had changed out of her maid's uniform into civvies: smart coveralls\r\nwhose micropore fabric breathed in time with her own respiration.\r\n\r\n\"Lil, Dan, I want you to meet Tim Fung. He was just telling me war\r\nstories from the Pirates project in Beijing.\"\r\n\r\nLil waved and Dan gravely shook his hand. \"That was some hard work,\" Dan\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me to turn on some Whuffie monitors. It was normally an\r\ninstantaneous reaction to meeting someone, but I was still disoriented.\r\nI pinged the elf. He had a lot of left-handed Whuffie; respect garnered\r\nfrom people who shared very few of my opinions. I expected that. What I\r\ndidn't expect was that his weighted Whuffie score, the one that lent\r\nextra credence to the rankings of people I respected, was also high --\r\nhigher than my own. I regretted my nonlinear behavior even more. Respect\r\nfrom the elf -- _Tim_, I had to remember to call him Tim -- would carry\r\na lot of weight in every camp that mattered.\r\n\r\nDan's score was incrementing upwards, but he still had a rotten profile.\r\nHe had accrued a good deal of left-handed Whuffie, and I curiously\r\nbacktraced it to the occasion of my murder, when Debra's people had\r\naccorded him a generous dollop of props for the levelheaded way he had\r\nscraped up my corpse and moved it offstage, minimizing the disturbance\r\nin front of their wondrous Pirates.\r\n\r\nI was fugueing, wandering off on the kind of mediated reverie that got\r\nme killed on the reef at Playa Coral, and I came out of it with a start,\r\nrealizing that the other three were politely ignoring my blown buffer. I\r\ncould have run backwards through my short-term memory to get the gist of\r\nthe conversation, but that would have lengthened the pause. Screw it.\r\n\"So, how're things going over at the Hall of the Presidents?\" I asked\r\nTim.\r\n\r\nLil shot me a cautioning look. She'd ceded the Hall to Debra's ad-hocs,\r\nthat being the only way to avoid the appearance of childish disattention\r\nto the almighty Whuffie. Now she had to keep up the fiction of good-\r\nnatured cooperation -- that meant not shoulder-surfing Debra, looking\r\nfor excuses to pounce on her work.\r\n\r\nTim gave us the same half-grin he'd greeted me with. On his smooth,\r\npointed features, it looked almost irredeemably cute. \"We're doing good\r\nstuff, I think. Debra's had her eye on the Hall for years, back in the\r\nold days, before she went to China. We're replacing the whole thing with\r\nbroadband uplinks of gestalts from each of the Presidents' lives:\r\nnewspaper headlines, speeches, distilled biographies, personal papers.\r\nIt'll be like having each President _inside_ you, core-dumped in a few\r\nseconds. Debra said we're going to _flash-bake_ the Presidents on your\r\nmind!\" His eyes glittered in the twilight.\r\n\r\nHaving only recently experienced my own cerebral flash-baking, Tim's\r\ndescription struck a chord in me. My personality seemed to be rattling\r\naround a little in my mind, as though it had been improperly fitted. It\r\nmade the idea of having the gestalt of 50-some Presidents squashed in\r\nalong with it perversely appealing.\r\n\r\n\"Wow,\" I said. \"That sounds wild. What do you have in mind for physical\r\nplant?\" The Hall as it stood had a quiet, patriotic dignity cribbed from\r\na hundred official buildings of the dead USA. Messing with it would be\r\nlike redesigning the stars-and-bars.\r\n\r\n\"That's not really my area,\" Tim said. \"I'm a programmer. But I could\r\nhave one of the designers squirt some plans at you, if you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be fine,\" Lil said, taking my elbow. \"I think we should be\r\nheading home, now, though.\" She began to tug me away. Dan took my other\r\nelbow. Behind her, the Liberty Belle glowed like a ghostly wedding cake\r\nin the twilight.\r\n\r\n\"That's too bad,\" Tim said. \"My ad-hoc is pulling an all-nighter on the\r\nnew Hall. I'm sure they'd love to have you drop by.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea seized hold of me. I would go into the camp of the enemy, sit\r\nby their fire, learn their secrets. \"That would be _great_!\" I said, too\r\nloudly. My head was buzzing slightly. Lil's hands fell away.\r\n\r\n\"But we've got an early morning tomorrow,\" Lil said. \"You've got a shift\r\nat eight, and I'm running into town for groceries.\" She was lying, but\r\nshe was telling me that this wasn't her idea of a smart move. But my\r\nfaith was unshakeable.\r\n\r\n\"Eight a.m. shift? No problem -- I'll be right here when it starts. I'll\r\njust grab a shower at the Contemporary in the morning and catch the\r\nmonorail back in time to change. All right?\"\r\n\r\nDan tried. \"But Jules, we were going to grab some dinner at Cinderella's\r\nRoyal Table, remember? I made reservations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw, we can eat any time,\" I said. \"This is a hell of an opportunity.\"\r\n\r\n\"It sure is,\" Dan said, giving up. \"Mind if I come along?\"\r\n\r\nHe and Lil traded meaningful looks that I interpreted to mean, _If he's\r\ngoing to be a nut, one of us really should stay with him_. I was past\r\ncaring -- I was going to beard the lion in his den!\r\n\r\nTim was apparently oblivious to all of this. \"Then it's settled! Let's\r\ngo.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nOn the walk to the Hall, Dan kept ringing my cochlea and I kept sending\r\nhim straight to voicemail. All the while, I kept up a patter of small-\r\ntalk with him and Tim. I was determined to make up for my debacle in the\r\nMansion with Tim, win him over.\r\n\r\nDebra's people were sitting around in the armchairs onstage, the\r\nanimatronic presidents stacked in neat piles in the wings. Debra was\r\nsprawled in Lincoln's armchair, her head cocked lazily, her legs\r\nextended before her. The Hall's normal smells of ozone and cleanliness\r\nwere overridden by sweat and machine-oil, the stink of an ad-hoc pulling\r\nan all-nighter. The Hall took fifteen years to research and execute, and\r\na couple of days to tear down.\r\n\r\nShe was au-naturel, still wearing the face she'd been born with, albeit\r\none that had been regenerated dozens of times after her deaths. It was\r\npatrician, waxy, long, with a nose that was made for staring down. She\r\nwas at least as old as I was, though she was only apparent 22. I got the\r\nsense that she picked this age because it was one that afforded\r\nboundless reserves of energy.\r\n\r\nShe didn't deign to rise as I approached, but she did nod languorously\r\nat me. The other ad-hocs had been split into little clusters, hunched\r\nover terminals. They all had the raccoon-eyed, sleep-deprived look of\r\nfanatics, even Debra, who managed to look lazy and excited\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\n_Did you have me killed_? I wondered, staring at Debra. After all, she'd\r\nbeen killed dozens, if not hundreds of times. It might not be such a big\r\ndeal for her.\r\n\r\n\"Hi there,\" I said, brightly. \"Tim offered to show us around! You know\r\nDan, right?\"\r\n\r\nDebra nodded at him. \"Oh, sure. Dan and I are pals, right?\"\r\n\r\nDan's poker face didn't twitch a muscle. \"Hello, Debra,\" he said. He'd\r\nbeen hanging out with them since Lil had briefed him on the peril to the\r\nMansion, trying to gather some intelligence for us to use. They knew\r\nwhat he was up to, of course, but Dan was a fairly charming guy and he\r\nworked like a mule, so they tolerated him. But it seemed like he'd\r\nviolated a boundary by accompanying me, as though the polite fiction\r\nthat he was more a part of Debra's ad-hoc than Lil's was shattered by my\r\npresence.\r\n\r\nTim said, \"Can I show them the demo, Debra?\"\r\n\r\nDebra quirked an eyebrow, then said, \"Sure, why not. You'll like this,\r\nguys.\"\r\n\r\nTim hustled us backstage, where Lil and I used to sweat over the\r\nanimatronics and cop surreptitious feels. Everything had been torn\r\nloose, packed up, stacked. They hadn't wasted a moment -- they'd spent a\r\nweek tearing down a show that had run for more than a century. The scrim\r\nthat the projected portions of the show normally screened on was ground\r\ninto the floor, spotted with grime, footprints and oil.\r\n\r\nTim showed me to a half-assembled backup terminal. Its housing was off,\r\nand any number of wireless keyboards, pointers and gloves lay strewn\r\nabout it. It had the look of a prototype.\r\n\r\n\"This is it -- our uplink. So far, we've got a demo app running on it:\r\nLincoln's old speech, along with the civil-war montage. Just switch on\r\nguest access and I'll core-dump it to you. It's wild.\"\r\n\r\nI pulled up my HUD and switched on guest access. Tim pointed a finger at\r\nthe terminal and my brain was suffused with the essence of Lincoln:\r\nevery nuance of his speech, the painstakingly researched movement tics,\r\nhis warts and beard and topcoat. It almost felt like I _was_ Lincoln,\r\nfor a moment, and then it passed. But I could still taste the lingering\r\ncoppery flavor of cannon-fire and chewing tobacco.\r\n\r\nI staggered backwards. My head swam with flash-baked sense-impressions,\r\nrich and detailed. I knew on the spot that Debra's Hall of the\r\nPresidents was going to be a hit.\r\n\r\nDan took a shot off the uplink, too. Tim and I watched him as his\r\nexpression shifted from skepticism to delight. Tim looked expectantly at\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"That's really fine,\" I said. \"Really, really fine. Moving.\"\r\n\r\nTim blushed. \"Thanks! I did the gestalt programming -- it's my\r\nspecialty.\"\r\n\r\nDebra spoke up from behind him -- she'd sauntered over while Dan was\r\ngetting his jolt. \"I got the idea in Beijing, when I was dying a lot.\r\nThere's something wonderful about having memories implanted, like you're\r\nreally working your brain. I love the synthetic clarity of it all.\"\r\n\r\nTim sniffed. \"Not synthetic at all,\" he said, turning to me. \"It's nice\r\nand soft, right?\"\r\n\r\nI sensed deep political shoals and was composing my reply when Debra\r\nsaid: \"Tim keeps trying to make it all more impressionistic, less\r\ncomputer-y. He's wrong, of course. We don't want to simulate the\r\nexperience of watching the show -- we want to _transcend it_.\"\r\n\r\nTim nodded reluctantly. \"Sure, transcend it. But the way we do that is\r\nby making the experience _human_, a mile in the presidents' shoes.\r\nEmpathy-driven. What's the point of flash-baking a bunch of dry facts on\r\nsomeone's brain?\"\r\n\r\n========= CHAPTER 4 =========\r\n\r\nOne night in the Hall of Presidents convinced me of three things:\r\n\r\n1. That Debra's people had had me killed, and screw their alibis,\r\n\r\n2. That they would kill me again, when the time came for them to make a\r\nplay for the Haunted Mansion,\r\n\r\n3. That our only hope for saving the Mansion was a preemptive strike\r\nagainst them: we had to hit them hard, where it hurt.\r\n\r\nDan and I had been treated to eight hours of insectile precision in the\r\nHall of Presidents, Debra's people working with effortless cooperation\r\nborn of the adversity they'd faced in Beijing. Debra moved from team to\r\nteam, making suggestions with body language as much as with words,\r\nleaving bursts of inspired activity in her wake.\r\n\r\nIt was that precision that convinced me of point one. Any ad-hoc this\r\ntight could pull off anything if it advanced their agenda. Ad-hoc? Hell,\r\ncall them what they were: an army.\r\n\r\nPoint two came to me when I sampled the Lincoln build that Tim finished\r\nat about three in the morning, after intensive consultation with Debra.\r\nThe mark of a great ride is that it gets better the second time around,\r\nas the detail and flourishes start to impinge on your consciousness. The\r\nMansion was full of little gimcracks and sly nods that snuck into your\r\nexperience on each successive ride.\r\n\r\nTim shuffled his feet nervously, bursting with barely restrained pride\r\nas I switched on public access. He dumped the app to my public\r\ndirectory, and, gingerly, I executed it.\r\n\r\nGod! God and Lincoln and cannon-fire and oratory and ploughs and mules\r\nand greatcoats! It rolled over me, it punched through me, it crashed\r\nagainst the inside of my skull and rebounded. The first pass through,\r\nthere had been a sense of order, of narrative, but this, this was\r\ngestalt, the whole thing in one undifferentiated ball, filling me and\r\nspilling over. It was panicky for a moment, as the essence of Lincolness\r\nseemed to threaten my own personality, and, just as it was about to\r\noverwhelm me, it receded, leaving behind a rush of endorphin and\r\nadrenaline that made me want to jump.\r\n\r\n\"Tim,\" I gasped. \"Tim! That was. . .\" Words failed me. I wanted to hug\r\nhim. What we could do for the Mansion with this! What elegance! Directly\r\nimprinting the experience, without recourse to the stupid, blind eyes;\r\nthe thick, deaf ears.\r\n\r\nTim beamed and basked, and Debra nodded solemnly from her throne. \"You\r\nliked it?\" Tim said. I nodded, and staggered back to the theatre seat\r\nwhere Dan slept, head thrown back, snores softly rattling in his throat.\r\n\r\nIncrementally, reason trickled back into my mind, and with it came ire.\r\nHow dare they? The wonderful compromises of technology and expense that\r\nhad given us the Disney rides -- rides that had entertained the world\r\nfor two centuries and more -- could never compete head to head with what\r\nthey were working on.\r\n\r\nMy hands knotted into fists in my lap. Why the fuck couldn't they do\r\nthis somewhere else? Why did they have to destroy everything I loved to\r\nrealize this? They could build this tech anywhere -- they could\r\ndistribute it online and people could access it from their living rooms!\r\n\r\nBut that would never do. Doing it here was better for the old Whuffie --\r\nthey'd make over Disney World and hold it, a single ad-hoc where three\r\nhundred had flourished before, smoothly operating a park twice the size\r\nof Manhattan.\r\n\r\nI stood and stalked out of the theater, out into Liberty Square and the\r\nPark. It had cooled down without drying out, and there was a damp chill\r\nthat crawled up my back and made my breath stick in my throat. I turned\r\nto contemplate the Hall of Presidents, staid and solid as it had been\r\nsince my boyhood and before, a monument to the Imagineers who\r\nanticipated the Bitchun Society, inspired it.\r\n\r\nI called Dan, still snoring back in the theater, and woke him. He\r\ngrunted unintelligibly in my cochlea.\r\n\r\n\"They did it -- they killed me.\" I knew they had, and I was glad. It\r\nmade what I had to do next easier.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Jesus. They didn't kill you -- they offered their backups,\r\nremember? They couldn't have done it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bullshit!\" I shouted into the empty night. \"Bullshit! They did it, and\r\nthey fucked with their backups somehow. They must have. It's all too\r\nneat and tidy. How else could they have gotten so far with the Hall so\r\nfast? They knew it was coming, they planned a disruption, and they moved\r\nin. Tell me that you think they just had these plans lying around and\r\nmoved on them when they could.\"\r\n\r\nDan groaned, and I heard his joints popping. He must have been\r\nstretching. The Park breathed around me, the sounds of maintenance crews\r\nscurrying in the night. \"I do believe that. Clearly, you don't. It's not\r\nthe first time we've disagreed. So now what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Now we save the Mansion,\" I said. \"Now we fight back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shit,\" Dan said.\r\n\r\nI have to admit, there was a part of me that concurred.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nMy opportunity came later that week. Debra's ad-hocs were showboating,\r\nannouncing a special preview of the new Hall to the other ad-hocs that\r\nworked in the Park. It was classic chutzpah, letting the key influencers\r\nin the Park in long before the bugs were hammered out. A smooth run\r\nwould garner the kind of impressed reaction that guaranteed continued\r\nsupport while they finished up; a failed demo could doom them. There\r\nwere plenty of people in the Park who had a sentimental attachment to\r\nthe Hall of Presidents, and whatever Debra's people came up with would\r\nhave to answer their longing.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to do it during the demo,\" I told Dan, while I piloted the\r\nrunabout from home to the castmember parking. I snuck a look at him to\r\ngauge his reaction. He had his poker face on.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to tell Lil,\" I continued. \"It's better that she doesn't\r\nknow -- plausible deniability.\"\r\n\r\n\"And me?\" he said. \"Don't I need plausible deniability?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said. \"No, you don't. You're an outsider. You can make the case\r\nthat you were working on your own -- gone rogue.\" I knew it wasn't fair.\r\nDan was here to build up his Whuffie, and if he was implicated in my\r\ndirty scheme, he'd have to start over again. I knew it wasn't fair, but\r\nI didn't care. I knew that we were fighting for our own survival. \"It's\r\ngood versus evil, Dan. You don't want to be a post-person. You want to\r\nstay human. The rides are human. We each mediate them through our own\r\nexperience. We're physically inside of them, and they talk to us through\r\nour senses. What Debra's people are building -- it's hive-mind shit.\r\nDirectly implanting thoughts! Jesus! It's not an experience, it's\r\nbrainwashing! You gotta know that.\" I was pleading, arguing with myself\r\nas much as with him.\r\n\r\nI snuck another look at him as I sped along the Disney back-roads, lined\r\nwith sweaty Florida pines and immaculate purple signage. Dan was looking\r\nthoughtful, the way he had back in our old days in Toronto. Some of my\r\ntension dissipated. He was thinking about it -- I'd gotten through to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Jules, this isn't one of your better ideas.\" My chest tightened, and he\r\npatted my shoulder. He had the knack of putting me at my ease, even when\r\nhe was telling me that I was an idiot. \"Even if Debra was behind your\r\nassassination -- and that's not a certainty, we both know that. Even if\r\nthat's the case, we've got better means at our disposal. Improving the\r\nMansion, competing with her head to head, that's smart. Give it a little\r\nwhile and we can come back at her, take over the Hall -- even the\r\nPirates, that'd really piss her off. Hell, if we can prove she was\r\nbehind the assassination, we can chase her off right now. Sabotage is\r\nnot going to do you any good. You've got lots of other options.\"\r\n\r\n\"But none of them are fast enough, and none of them are emotionally\r\nsatisfying. This way has some goddamn _balls_.\"\r\n\r\nWe reached castmember parking, I swung the runabout into a slot and\r\nstalked out before it had a chance to extrude its recharger cock. I\r\nheard Dan's door slam behind me and knew that he was following behind.\r\n\r\nWe took to the utilidors grimly. I walked past the cameras, knowing that\r\nmy image was being archived, my presence logged. I'd picked the timing\r\nof my raid carefully: by arriving at high noon, I was sticking to my\r\ntraditional pattern for watching hot-weather crowd dynamics. I'd made a\r\npoint of visiting twice during the previous week at this time, and of\r\ndawdling in the commissary before heading topside. The delay between my\r\narrival in the runabout and my showing up at the Mansion would not be\r\ndiscrepant.\r\n\r\nDan dogged my heels as I swung towards the commissary, and then hugged\r\nthe wall, in the camera's blindspot. Back in my early days in the Park,\r\nwhen I was courting Lil, she showed me the A-Vac, the old pneumatic\r\nwaste-disposal system, decommissioned in the 20s. The kids who grew up\r\nin the Park had been notorious explorers of the tubes, which still\r\nwhiffed faintly of the garbage bags they'd once whisked at 60 mph to the\r\ndump on the property's outskirts, but for a brave, limber kid, the tubes\r\nwere a subterranean wonderland to explore when the hypermediated\r\nexperiences of the Park lost their luster.\r\n\r\nI snarled a grin and popped open the service entrance. \"If they hadn't\r\nkilled me and forced me to switch to a new body, I probably wouldn't be\r\nflexible enough to fit in,\" I hissed at Dan. \"Ironic, huh?\"\r\n\r\nI clambered inside without waiting for a reply, and started inching my\r\nway under the Hall of Presidents.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nMy plan had covered every conceivable detail, except one, which didn't\r\noccur to me until I was forty minutes into the pneumatic tube, arms held\r\nbefore me and legs angled back like a swimmer's.\r\n\r\nHow was I going to reach into my pockets?\r\n\r\nSpecifically, how was I going to retrieve my HERF gun from my back\r\npants-pocket, when I couldn't even bend my elbows? The HERF gun was the\r\ncrux of the plan: a High Energy Radio Frequency generator with a\r\ndirectional, focused beam that would punch up through the floor of the\r\nHall of Presidents and fuse every goddamn scrap of unshielded\r\nelectronics on the premises. I'd gotten the germ of the idea during\r\nTim's first demo, when I'd seen all of his prototypes spread out\r\nbackstage, cases off, ready to be tinkered with. Unshielded.\r\n\r\n\"Dan,\" I said, my voice oddly muffled by the tube's walls.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah?\" he said. He'd been silent during the journey, the sound of his\r\npainful, elbow-dragging progress through the lightless tube my only\r\nindicator of his presence.\r\n\r\n\"Can you reach my back pocket?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shit,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Goddamn it,\" I said, \"keep the fucking editorial to yourself. Can you\r\nreach it or not?\"\r\n\r\nI heard him grunt as he pulled himself up in the tube, then felt his\r\nhand groping up my calf. Soon, his chest was crushing my calves into the\r\ntube's floor and his hand was pawing around my ass.\r\n\r\n\"I can reach it,\" he said. I could tell from his tone that he wasn't too\r\nhappy about my snapping at him, but I was too wrapped up to consider an\r\napology, despite what must be happening to my Whuffie as Dan did his\r\nslow burn.\r\n\r\nHe fumbled the gun -- a narrow cylinder as long as my palm -- out of my\r\npocket. \"Now what?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Can you pass it up?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nDan crawled higher, overtop of me, but stuck fast when his ribcage met\r\nmy glutes. \"I can't get any further,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Fine,\" I said. \"You'll have to fire it, then.\" I held my breath. Would\r\nhe do it? It was one thing to be my accomplice, another to be the author\r\nof the destruction.\r\n\r\n\"Aw, Jules,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"A simple yes or no, Dan. That's all I want to hear from you.\" I was\r\nboiling with anger -- at myself, at Dan, at Debra, at the whole goddamn\r\nthing.\r\n\r\n\"Fine,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Good. Dial it up to max dispersion and point it straight up.\"\r\n\r\nI heard him release the catch, felt a staticky crackle in the air, and\r\nthen it was done. The gun was a one-shot, something I'd confiscated from\r\na mischievous guest a decade before, when they'd had a brief vogue.\r\n\r\n\"Hang on to it,\" I said. I had no intention of leaving such a damning\r\nbit of evidence behind. I resumed my bellycrawl forward to the next\r\nservice hatch, near the parking lot, where I'd stashed an identical\r\nchange of clothes for both of us.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nWe made it back just as the demo was getting underway. Debra's ad-hocs\r\nwere ranged around the mezzanine inside the Hall of Presidents, a\r\ncollection of influential castmembers from other ad-hocs filling the\r\npre-show area to capacity.\r\n\r\nDan and I filed in just as Tim was stringing the velvet rope up behind\r\nthe crowd. He gave me a genuine smile and shook my hand, and I smiled\r\nback, full of good feelings now that I knew that he was going down in\r\nflames. I found Lil and slipped my hand into hers as we filed into the\r\nauditorium, which had the new-car smell of rug shampoo and fresh\r\nelectronics.\r\n\r\nWe took our seats and I bounced my leg nervously, compulsively, while\r\nDebra, dressed in Lincoln's coat and stovepipe, delivered a short\r\nspeech. There was some kind of broadcast rig mounted over the stage now,\r\nsomething to allow them to beam us all their app in one humongous burst.\r\n\r\nDebra finished up and stepped off the stage to a polite round of\r\napplause, and they started the demo.\r\n\r\nNothing happened. I tried to keep the shit-eating grin off my face as\r\nnothing happened. No tone in my cochlea indicating a new file in my\r\npublic directory, no rush of sensation, nothing. I turned to Lil to make\r\nsome snotty remark, but her eyes were closed, her mouth lolling open,\r\nher breath coming in short huffs. Down the row, every castmember was in\r\nthe same attitude of deep, mind-blown concentration. I pulled up a\r\ndiagnostic HUD.\r\n\r\nNothing. No diagnostics. No HUD. I cold-rebooted.\r\n\r\nNothing.\r\n\r\nI was offline.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nOffline, I filed out of the Hall of Presidents. Offline, I took Lil's\r\nhand and walked to the Liberty Belle load-zone, our spot for private\r\nconversations. Offline, I bummed a cigarette from her.\r\n\r\nLil was upset -- even through my bemused, offline haze, I could tell\r\nthat. Tears pricked her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you tell me?\" she said, after a hard moment's staring into\r\nthe moonlight reflecting off the river.\r\n\r\n\"Tell you?\" I said, dumbly.\r\n\r\n\"They're really good. They're better than good. They're better than us.\r\nOh, God.\"\r\n\r\nOffline, I couldn't find stats or signals to help me discuss the matter.\r\nOffline, I tried it without help. \"I don't think so. I don't think\r\nthey've got soul, I don't think they've got history, I don't think\r\nthey've got any kind of connection to the past. The world grew up in the\r\nDisneys -- they visit this place for continuity as much as for\r\nentertainment. We provide that.\" I'm offline, and they're not -- what\r\nthe hell happened?\r\n\r\n\"It'll be okay, Lil. There's nothing in that place that's better than\r\nus. Different and new, but not better. You know that -- you've spent\r\nmore time in the Mansion than anyone, you know how much refinement, how\r\nmuch work there is in there. How can something they whipped up in a\r\ncouple weeks possibly be better that this thing we've been maintaining\r\nfor all these years?\"\r\n\r\nShe ground the back of her sleeve against her eyes and smiled. \"Sorry,\"\r\nshe said. Her nose was red, her eyes puffy, her freckles livid over the\r\nflush of her cheeks. \"Sorry -- it's just shocking. Maybe you're right.\r\nAnd even if you're not -- hey, that's the whole point of a meritocracy,\r\nright? The best stuff survives, everything else gets supplanted.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, shit, I hate how I look when I cry,\" she said. \"Let's go\r\ncongratulate them.\"\r\n\r\nAs I took her hand, I was obscurely pleased with myself for having\r\nimproved her mood without artificial assistance.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDan was nowhere to be seen as Lil and I mounted the stage at the Hall,\r\nwhere Debra's ad-hocs and a knot of well-wishers were celebrating by\r\npassing a rock around. Debra had lost the tailcoat and hat, and was in\r\nan extreme state of relaxation, arms around the shoulders of two of her\r\ncronies, pipe between her teeth.\r\n\r\nShe grinned around the pipe as Lil and I stumbled through some insincere\r\ncompliments, nodded, and toked heavily while Tim applied a torch to the\r\nbowl.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" she said, laconically. \"It was a team effort.\" She hugged her\r\ncronies to her, almost knocking their heads together.\r\n\r\nLil said, \"What's your timeline, then?\"\r\n\r\nDebra started unreeling a long spiel about critical paths, milestones,\r\nrequirements meetings, and I tuned her out. Ad-hocs were crazy for that\r\nprocess stuff. I stared at my feet, at the floorboards, and realized\r\nthat they weren't floorboards at all, but faux-finish painted over a\r\ncopper mesh -- a Faraday cage. That's why the HERF gun hadn't done\r\nanything; that's why they'd been so casual about working with the\r\nshielding off their computers. With my eye, I followed the copper\r\nshielding around the entire stage and up the walls, where it disappeared\r\ninto the ceiling. Once again, I was struck by the evolvedness of Debra's\r\nad-hocs, how their trial by fire in China had armored them against the\r\nkind of bush-league jiggery-pokery that the fuzzy bunnies in Florida --\r\nmyself included -- came up with.\r\n\r\nFor instance, I didn't think there was a single castmember in the Park\r\noutside of Deb's clique with the stones to stage an assassination. Once\r\nI'd made that leap, I realized that it was only a matter of time until\r\nthey staged another one -- and another, and another. Whatever they could\r\nget away with.\r\n\r\nDebra's spiel finally wound down and Lil and I headed away. I stopped in\r\nfront of the backup terminal in the gateway between Liberty Square and\r\nFantasyland. \"When was the last time you backed up?\" I asked her. If\r\nthey could go after me, they might go after any of us.\r\n\r\n\"Yesterday,\" she said. She exuded bone-weariness at me, looking more\r\nlike an overmediated guest than a tireless castmember.\r\n\r\n\"Let's run another backup, huh? We should really back up at night and at\r\nlunchtime -- with things the way they are, we can't afford to lose an\r\nafternoon's work, much less a week's.\"\r\n\r\nLil rolled her eyes. I knew better than to argue with her when she was\r\ntired, but this was too crucial to set aside for petulance. \"You can\r\nback up that often if you want to, Julius, but don't tell me how to live\r\nmy life, okay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Lil -- it only takes a minute, and it'd make me feel a lot\r\nbetter. Please?\" I hated the whine in my voice.\r\n\r\n\"No, Julius. No. Let's go home and get some sleep. I want to do some\r\nwork on new merch for the Mansion -- some collectible stuff, maybe.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Christ's sake, is it really so much to ask? Fine. Wait while I back\r\nup, then, all right?\"\r\n\r\nLil groaned and glared at me.\r\n\r\nI approached the terminal and cued a backup. Nothing happened. Oh, yeah,\r\nright, I was offline. A cool sweat broke out all over my new body.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nLil grabbed the couch as soon as we got in, mumbling something about\r\nwanting to work on some revised merch ideas she'd had. I glared at her\r\nas she subvocalized and air-typed in the corner, shut away from me. I\r\nhadn't told her that I was offline yet -- it just seemed like\r\ninsignificant personal bitching relative to the crises she was coping\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nBesides, I'd been knocked offline before, though not in fifty years, and\r\noften as not the system righted itself after a good night's sleep. I\r\ncould visit the doctor in the morning if things were still screwy.\r\n\r\nSo I crawled into bed, and when my bladder woke me in the night, I had\r\nto go into the kitchen to consult our old starburst clock to get the\r\ntime. It was 3 a.m., and when the hell had we expunged the house of all\r\ntimepieces, anyway?\r\n\r\nLil was sacked out on the couch, and complained feebly when I tried to\r\nrouse her, so I covered her with a blanket and went back to bed, alone.\r\n\r\nI woke disoriented and crabby, without my customary morning jolt of\r\nendorphin. Vivid dreams of death and destruction slipped away as I sat\r\nup. I preferred to let my subconscious do its own thing, so I'd long ago\r\nprogrammed my systems to keep me asleep during REM cycles except in\r\nemergencies. The dream left a foul taste in my mind as I staggered into\r\nthe kitchen, where Lil was fixing coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you wake me up last night? I'm one big ache from sleeping on\r\nthe couch,\" Lil said as I stumbled in.\r\n\r\nShe had the perky, jaunty quality of someone who could instruct her\r\nnervous system to manufacture endorphin and adrenaline at will. I felt\r\nlike punching the wall.\r\n\r\n\"You wouldn't get up,\" I said, and slopped coffee in the general\r\ndirection of a mug, then scalded my tongue with it.\r\n\r\n\"And why are you up so late? I was hoping you would cover a shift for me\r\n-- the merch ideas are really coming together and I wanted to hit the\r\nImagineering shop and try some prototyping.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't.\" I foraged a slice of bread with cheese and noticed a crumby\r\nplate in the sink. Dan had already eaten and gone, apparently.\r\n\r\n\"Really?\" she said, and my blood started to boil in earnest. I slammed\r\nDan's plate into the dishwasher and shoved bread into my maw.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Really. It's your shift -- fucking work it or call in sick.\"\r\n\r\nLil reeled. Normally, I was the soul of sweetness in the morning, when I\r\nwas hormonally enhanced, anyway. \"What's wrong, honey?\" she said, going\r\ninto helpful castmember mode. Now I wanted to hit something besides the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n\"Just leave me alone, all right? Go fiddle with fucking merch. I've got\r\nreal work to do -- in case you haven't noticed, Debra's about to eat you\r\nand your little band of plucky adventurers and pick her teeth with the\r\nbones. For God's sake, Lil, don't you ever get fucking angry about\r\nanything? Don't you have any goddamned passion?\"\r\n\r\nLil whitened and I felt a sinking feeling in my gut. It was the worst\r\nthing I could possibly have said.\r\n\r\nLil and I met three years before, at a barbecue that some friends of her\r\nparents threw, a kind of castmember mixer. She'd been just 19 --\r\napparent and real -- and had a bubbly, flirty vibe that made me dismiss\r\nher, at first, as just another airhead castmember.\r\n\r\nHer parents -- Tom and Rita -- on the other hand, were fascinating\r\npeople, members of the original ad-hoc that had seized power in Walt\r\nDisney World, wresting control from a gang of wealthy former\r\nshareholders who'd been operating it as their private preserve. Rita was\r\napparent 20 or so, but she radiated a maturity and a fiery devotion to\r\nthe Park that threw her daughter's superficiality into sharp relief.\r\n\r\nThey throbbed with Whuffie, Whuffie beyond measure, beyond use. In a\r\nworld where even a zeroed-out Whuffie loser could eat, sleep, travel and\r\naccess the net without hassle, their wealth was more than sufficient to\r\nrepeatedly access the piffling few scarce things left on earth over and\r\nover.\r\n\r\nThe conversation turned to the first day, when she and her pals had used\r\na cutting torch on the turnstiles and poured in, wearing homemade\r\ncostumes and name tags. They infiltrated the shops, the control centers,\r\nthe rides, first by the hundred, then, as the hot July day ticked by, by\r\nthe thousand. The shareholders' lackeys -- who worked the Park for the\r\nchance to be a part of the magic, even if they had no control over the\r\nmanagement decisions -- put up a token resistance. Before the day was\r\nout, though, the majority had thrown in their lots with the raiders,\r\nhanding over security codes and pitching in.\r\n\r\n\"But we knew the shareholders wouldn't give in as easy as that,\" Lil's\r\nmother said, sipping her lemonade. \"We kept the Park running 24/7 for\r\nthe next two weeks, never giving the shareholders a chance to fight back\r\nwithout doing it in front of the guests. We'd prearranged with a couple\r\nof airline ad-hocs to add extra routes to Orlando and the guests came\r\npouring in.\" She smiled, remembering the moment, and her features in\r\nrepose were Lil's almost identically. It was only when she was talking\r\nthat her face changed, muscles tugging it into an expression decades\r\nolder than the face that bore it.\r\n\r\n\"I spent most of the time running the merch stand at Madame Leota's\r\noutside the Mansion, gladhanding the guests while hissing nasties back\r\nand forth with the shareholders who kept trying to shove me out. I slept\r\nin a sleeping bag on the floor of the utilidor, with a couple dozen\r\nothers, in three hour shifts. That was when I met this asshole\" -- she\r\nchucked her husband on the shoulder -- \"he'd gotten the wrong sleeping\r\nbag by mistake and wouldn't budge when I came down to crash. I just\r\ncrawled in next to him and the rest, as they say, is history.\"\r\n\r\nLil rolled her eyes and made gagging noises. \"Jesus, Rita, no one needs\r\nto hear about that part of it.\"\r\n\r\nTom patted her arm. \"Lil, you're an adult -- if you can't stomach\r\nhearing about your parents' courtship, you can either sit somewhere else\r\nor grin and bear it. But you don't get to dictate the topic of\r\nconversation.\"\r\n\r\nLil gave us adults a very youthful glare and flounced off. Rita shook\r\nher head at Lil's departing backside. \"There's not much fire in that\r\ngeneration,\" she said. \"Not a lot of passion. It's our fault -- we\r\nthought that Disney World would be the best place to raise a child in\r\nthe Bitchun Society. Maybe it was, but. . .\" She trailed off and rubbed\r\nher palms on her thighs, a gesture I'd come to know in Lil, by and by.\r\n\"I guess there aren't enough challenges for them these days. They're too\r\ncooperative.\" She laughed and her husband took her hand.\r\n\r\n\"We sound like our parents,\" Tom said. \"'When we were growing up, we\r\ndidn't have any of this newfangled life-extension stuff -- we took our\r\nchances with the cave bears and the dinosaurs!'\" Tom wore himself older,\r\napparent 50, with graying sidewalls and crinkled smile-lines, the better\r\nto present a non-threatening air of authority to the guests. It was a\r\ntruism among the first-gen ad-hocs that women castmembers should wear\r\nthemselves young, men old. \"We're just a couple of Bitchun\r\nfundamentalists, I guess.\"\r\n\r\nLil called over from a nearby conversation: \"Are they telling you what a\r\npack of milksops we are, Julius? When you get tired of that, why don't\r\nyou come over here and have a smoke?\" I noticed that she and her cohort\r\nwere passing a crack pipe.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use?\" Lil's mother sighed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know that it's as bad as all that,\" I said, virtually my\r\nfirst words of the afternoon. I was painfully conscious that I was only\r\nthere by courtesy, just one of the legion of hopefuls who flocked to\r\nOrlando every year, aspiring to a place among the ruling cliques.\r\n\"They're passionate about maintaining the Park, that's for sure. I made\r\nthe mistake of lifting a queue-gate at the Jungleboat Cruise last week\r\nand I got a very earnest lecture about the smooth functioning of the\r\nPark from a castmember who couldn't have been more than 18. I think that\r\nthey don't have the passion for creating Bitchunry that we have -- they\r\ndon't need it -- but they've got plenty of drive to maintain it.\"\r\n\r\nLil's mother gave me a long, considering look that I didn't know what to\r\nmake of. I couldn't tell if I had offended her or what.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, you can't be a revolutionary after the revolution, can you?\r\nDidn't we all struggle so that kids like Lil wouldn't have to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Funny you should say that,\" Tom said. He had the same considering look\r\non his face. \"Just yesterday we were talking about the very same thing.\r\nWe were talking --\" he drew a breath and looked askance at his wife, who\r\nnodded -- \"about deadheading. For a while, anyway. See if things changed\r\nmuch in fifty or a hundred years.\"\r\n\r\nI felt a kind of shameful disappointment. Why was I wasting my time\r\nschmoozing with these two, when they wouldn't be around when the time\r\ncame to vote me in? I banished the thought as quickly as it came -- I\r\nwas talking to them because they were nice people. Not every\r\nconversation had to be strategically important.\r\n\r\n\"Really? Deadheading.\" I remember that I thought of Dan then, about his\r\nviews on the cowardice of deadheading, on the bravery of ending it when\r\nyou found yourself obsolete. He'd comforted me once, when my last living\r\nrelative, my uncle, opted to go to sleep for three thousand years. My\r\nuncle had been born pre-Bitchun, and had never quite gotten the hang of\r\nit. Still, he was my link to my family, to my first adulthood and my\r\nonly childhood. Dan had taken me to Gananoque and we'd spent the day\r\nbounding around the countryside on seven-league boots, sailing high over\r\nthe lakes of the Thousand Islands and the crazy fiery carpet of autumn\r\nleaves. We topped off the day at a dairy commune he knew where they\r\nstill made cheese from cow's milk and there'd been a thousand smells and\r\nbottles of strong cider and a girl whose name I'd long since forgotten\r\nbut whose exuberant laugh I'd remember forever. And it wasn't so\r\nimportant, then, my uncle going to sleep for three milliennia, because\r\nwhatever happened, there were the leaves and the lakes and the crisp\r\nsunset the color of blood and the girl's laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Have you talked to Lil about it?\"\r\n\r\nRita shook her head. \"It's just a thought, really. We don't want to\r\nworry her. She's not good with hard decisions -- it's her generation.\"\r\n\r\nThey changed the subject not long thereafter, and I sensed discomfort,\r\nknew that they had told me too much, more than they'd intended. I\r\ndrifted off and found Lil and her young pals, and we toked a little and\r\ncuddled a little.\r\n\r\nWithin a month, I was working at the Haunted Mansion, Tom and Rita were\r\ninvested in Canopic jars in Kissimee with instructions not to be woken\r\nuntil their newsbots grabbed sufficient interesting material to make it\r\nworth their while, and Lil and I were a hot item.\r\n\r\nLil didn't deal well with her parents' decision to deadhead. For her, it\r\nwas a slap in the face, a reproach to her and her generation of\r\ntwittering Polyannic castmembers.\r\n\r\nFor God's sake, Lil, don't you ever get fucking angry about anything?\r\nDon't you have any goddamned passion?\r\n\r\nThe words were out of my mouth before I knew I was saying them, and Lil,\r\n15 percent of my age, young enough to be my great-granddaughter; Lil, my\r\nlover and best friend and sponsor to the Liberty Square ad-hocracy; Lil\r\nturned white as a sheet, turned on her heel and walked out of the\r\nkitchen. She got in her runabout and went to the Park to take her shift.\r\n\r\nI went back to bed and stared at the ceiling fan as it made its lazy\r\nturns, and felt like shit.\r\n\r\n========= CHAPTER 5 =========\r\n\r\nWhen I finally returned to the Park, 36 hours had passed and Lil had not\r\ncome back to the house. If she'd tried to call, she would've gotten my\r\nvoicemail -- I had no way of answering my phone. As it turned out, she\r\nhadn't been trying to reach me at all.\r\n\r\nI'd spent the time alternately moping, drinking, and plotting terrible,\r\nirrational vengeance on Debra for killing me, destroying my\r\nrelationship, taking away my beloved (in hindsight, anyway) Hall of\r\nPresidents and threatening the Mansion. Even in my addled state, I knew\r\nthat this was pretty unproductive, and I kept promising that I would cut\r\nit out, take a shower and some sober-ups, and get to work at the\r\nMansion.\r\n\r\nI was working up the energy to do just that when Dan came in.\r\n\r\n\"Jesus,\" he said, shocked. I guess I was a bit of a mess, sprawled on\r\nthe sofa in my underwear, all gamy and baggy and bloodshot.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, Dan. How's it goin'?\"\r\n\r\nHe gave me one of his patented wry looks and I felt the same weird\r\nreversal of roles that we'd undergone at the U of T, when he had become\r\nthe native, and I had become the interloper. He was the together one\r\nwith the wry looks and I was the pathetic seeker who'd burned all his\r\nreputation capital. Out of habit, I checked my Whuffie, and a moment\r\nlater I stopped being startled by its low score and was instead shocked\r\nby the fact that I could check it at all. I was back online!\r\n\r\n\"Now, what do you know about that?\" I said, staring at my dismal\r\nWhuffie.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" he said.\r\n\r\nI called his cochlea. \"My systems are back online,\" I subvocalized.\r\n\r\nHe started. \"You were offline?\"\r\n\r\nI jumped up from the couch and did a little happy underwear dance. \"I\r\n_was_, but I'm not _now_.\" I felt better than I had in days, ready to\r\nbeat the world -- or at least Debra.\r\n\r\n\"Let me take a shower, then let's get to the Imagineering labs. I've got\r\na pretty kickass idea.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe idea, as I explained it in the runabout, was a preemptive rehab of\r\nthe Mansion. Sabotaging the Hall had been a nasty, stupid idea, and I'd\r\ngotten what I deserved for it. The whole point of the Bitchun Society\r\nwas to be more reputable than the next ad-hoc, to succeed on merit, not\r\ntrickery, despite assassinations and the like.\r\n\r\nSo a rehab it would be.\r\n\r\n\"Back in the early days of the Disneyland Mansion, in California,\" I\r\nexplained, \"Walt had a guy in a suit of armor just past the first Doom\r\nBuggy curve, he'd leap out and scare the hell out of the guests as they\r\nwent by. It didn't last long, of course. The poor bastard kept getting\r\npunched out by startled guests, and besides, the armor wasn't too\r\ncomfortable for long shifts.\"\r\n\r\nDan chuckled appreciatively. The Bitchun Society had all but done away\r\nwith any sort of dull, repetitious labor, and what remained -- tending\r\nbar, mopping toilets -- commanded Whuffie aplenty and a life of leisure\r\nin your off-hours.\r\n\r\n\"But that guy in the suit of armor, he could _improvise_. You'd get a\r\nslightly different show every time. It's like the castmembers who spiel\r\non the Jungleboat Cruise. They've each got their own patter, their own\r\njokes, and even though the animatronics aren't so hot, it makes the show\r\nworth seeing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're going to fill the Mansion with castmembers in armor?\" Dan asked,\r\nshaking his head.\r\n\r\nI waved away his objections, causing the runabout to swerve, terrifying\r\na pack of guests who were taking a ride on rented bikes around the\r\nproperty. \"No,\" I said, flapping a hand apologetically at the white-\r\nfaced guests. \"Not at all. But what if all of the animatronics had human\r\noperators -- telecontrollers, working with waldoes? We'll let them\r\ninteract with the guests, talk with them, scare them. . . We'll get rid\r\nof the existing animatronics, replace 'em with full-mobility robots,\r\nthen cast the parts over the Net. Think of the Whuffie! You could put,\r\nsay, a thousand operators online at once, ten shifts per day, each of\r\nthem caught up in our Mansion. . . We'll give out awards for outstanding\r\nperformances, the shifts'll be based on popular vote. In effect, we'll\r\nbe adding another ten thousand guests to the Mansion's throughput every\r\nday, only these guests will be honorary castmembers.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's pretty good,\" Dan said. \"Very Bitchun. Debra may have AI and\r\nflash-baking, but you'll have human interaction, courtesy of the biggest\r\nMansion-fans in the world --\"\r\n\r\n\"And those are the very fans Debra'll have to win over to make a play\r\nfor the Mansion. Very elegant, huh?\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe first order of business was to call Lil, patch things up, and pitch\r\nthe idea to her. The only problem was, my cochlea was offline again. My\r\nmood started to sour, and I had Dan call her instead.\r\n\r\nWe met her up at Imagineering, a massive complex of prefab aluminum\r\nbuildings painted Go-Away Green that had thronged with mad inventors\r\nsince the Bitchun Society had come to Walt Disney World. The ad-hocs who\r\nhad built an Imagineering department in Florida and now ran the thing\r\nwere the least political in the Park, classic labcoat-and-clipboard\r\ntypes who would work for anyone so long as the ideas were cool. Not\r\ncaring about Whuffie meant that they accumulated it in plenty on both\r\nthe left and right hands.\r\n\r\nLil was working with Suneep, AKA the Merch Miracle. He could design,\r\nprototype and produce a souvenir faster than anyone -- shirts,\r\nsculptures, pens, toys, housewares, he was the king. They were\r\ncollaborating on their HUDs, facing each other across a lab-bench in the\r\nmiddle of a lab as big as a basketball court, cluttered with logomarked\r\ntchotchkes and gabbling away while their eyes danced over invisible\r\nscreens.\r\n\r\nDan reflexively joined the collaborative space as he entered the lab,\r\nleaving me the only one out on the joke. Dan was clearly delighted by\r\nwhat he saw.\r\n\r\nI nudged him with an elbow. \"Make a hardcopy,\" I hissed.\r\n\r\nInstead of pitying me, he just airtyped a few commands and pages started\r\nto roll out of a printer in the lab's corner. Anyone else would have\r\nmade a big deal out of it, but he just brought me into the discussion.\r\n\r\nIf I needed proof that Lil and I were meant for each other, the designs\r\nshe and Suneep had come up with were more than enough. She'd been\r\nthinking just the way I had -- souvenirs that stressed the human scale\r\nof the Mansion. There were miniature animatronics of the Hitchhiking\r\nGhosts in a black-light box, their skeletal robotics visible through\r\ntheir layers of plastic clothing; action figures that communicated by\r\nIR, so that placing one in proximity with another would unlock its\r\nMansion-inspired behaviors -- the raven cawed, Mme. Leota's head\r\nincanted, the singing busts sang. She'd worked up some formal attire\r\nbased on the castmember costume, cut in this year's stylish lines.\r\n\r\nIt was good merch, is what I'm trying to say. In my mind's eye, I was\r\nseeing the relaunch of the Mansion in six months, filled with robotic\r\navatars of Mansion-nuts the world 'round, Mme. Leota's gift cart piled\r\nhigh with brilliant swag, strolling human players ad-libbing with the\r\nguests in the queue area. . .\r\n\r\nLil looked up from her mediated state and glared at me as I pored over\r\nthe hardcopy, nodding enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"Passionate enough for you?\" she snapped.\r\n\r\nI felt a flush creeping into face, my ears. It was somewhere between\r\nanger and shame, and I reminded myself that I was more than a century\r\nolder than her, and it was my responsibility to be mature. Also, I'd\r\nstarted the fight.\r\n\r\n\"This is fucking fantastic, Lil,\" I said. Her look didn't soften.\r\n\"Really choice stuff. I had a great idea --\" I ran it down for her, the\r\navatars, the robots, the rehab. She stopped glaring, started taking\r\nnotes, smiling, showing me her dimples, her slanted eyes crinkling at\r\nthe corners.\r\n\r\n\"This isn't easy,\" she said, finally. Suneep, who'd been politely\r\npretending not to listen in, nodded involuntarily. Dan, too.\r\n\r\n\"I know that,\" I said. The flush burned hotter. \"But that's the point --\r\nwhat Debra does isn't easy either. It's risky, dangerous. It made her\r\nand her ad-hoc better -- it made them sharper.\" _Sharper than us, that's\r\nfor sure_. \"They can make decisions like this fast, and execute them\r\njust as quickly. We need to be able to do that, too.\"\r\n\r\nWas I really advocating being more like Debra? The words'd just popped\r\nout, but I saw that I'd been right -- we'd have to beat Debra at her own\r\ngame, out-evolve her ad-hocs.\r\n\r\n\"I understand what you're saying,\" Lil said. I could tell she was upset\r\n-- she'd reverted to castmemberspeak. \"It's a very good idea. I think\r\nthat we stand a good chance of making it happen if we approach the group\r\nand put it to them, after doing the research, building the plans, laying\r\nout the critical path, and privately soliciting feedback from some of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nI felt like I was swimming in molasses. At the rate that the Liberty\r\nSquare ad-hoc moved, we'd be holding formal requirements reviews while\r\nDebra's people tore down the Mansion around us. So I tried a different\r\ntactic.\r\n\r\n\"Suneep, you've been involved in some rehabs, right?\"\r\n\r\nSuneep nodded slowly, with a cautious expression, a nonpolitical animal\r\nbeing drawn into a political discussion.\r\n\r\n\"Okay, so tell me, if we came to you with this plan and asked you to\r\npull together a production schedule -- one that didn't have any review,\r\njust take the idea and run with it -- and then pull it off, how long\r\nwould it take you to execute it?\"\r\n\r\nLil smiled primly. She'd dealt with Imagineering before.\r\n\r\n\"About five years,\" he said, almost instantly.\r\n\r\n\"Five years?\" I squawked. \"Why five years? Debra's people overhauled the\r\nHall in a month!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, wait,\" he said. \"No review at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No review. Just come up with the best way you can to do this, and do\r\nit. And we can provide you with unlimited, skilled labor, three shifts\r\naround the clock.\"\r\n\r\nHe rolled his eyes back and ticked off days on his fingers while\r\nmuttering under his breath. He was a tall, thin man with a shock of\r\ncurly dark hair that he smoothed unconsciously with surprisingly stubby\r\nfingers while he thought.\r\n\r\n\"About eight weeks,\" he said. \"Barring accidents, assuming off-the-shelf\r\nparts, unlimited labor, capable management, material availability. . .\"\r\nHe trailed off again, and his short fingers waggled as he pulled up a\r\nHUD and started making a list.\r\n\r\n\"Wait,\" Lil said, alarmed. \"How do you get from five years to eight\r\nweeks?\"\r\n\r\nNow it was my turn to smirk. I'd seen how Imagineering worked when they\r\nwere on their own, building prototypes and conceptual mockups -- I knew\r\nthat the real bottleneck was the constant review and revisions, the\r\never-fluctuating groupmind consensus of the ad-hoc that commissioned\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nSuneep looked sheepish. \"Well, if all I have to do is satisfy myself\r\nthat my plans are good and my buildings won't fall down, I can make it\r\nhappen very fast. Of course, my plans aren't perfect. Sometimes, I'll be\r\nhalfway through a project when someone suggests a new flourish or\r\napproach that makes the whole thing immeasurably better. Then it's back\r\nto the drawing board. . . So I stay at the drawing board for a long time\r\nat the start, get feedback from other Imagineers, from the ad-hocs, from\r\nfocus groups and the Net. Then we do reviews at every stage of\r\nconstruction, check to see if anyone has had a great idea we haven't\r\nthought of and incorporate it, sometimes rolling back the work.\r\n\r\n\"It's slow, but it works.\"\r\n\r\nLil was flustered. \"But if you can do a complete revision in eight\r\nweeks, why not just finish it, then plan another revision, do _that_ one\r\nin eight weeks, and so on? Why take five years before anyone can ride\r\nthe thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because that's how it's done,\" I said to Lil. \"But that's not how it\r\n_has_ to be done. That's how we'll save the Mansion.\"\r\n\r\nI felt the surety inside of me, the certain knowledge that I was right.\r\nAd-hocracy was a great thing, a Bitchun thing, but the organization\r\nneeded to turn on a dime -- that would be even _more_ Bitchun.\r\n\r\n\"Lil,\" I said, looking into her eyes, trying to burn my POV into her.\r\n\"We have to do this. It's our only chance. We'll recruit hundreds to\r\ncome to Florida and work on the rehab. We'll give every Mansion nut on\r\nthe planet a shot at joining up, then we'll recruit them again to work\r\nat it, to run the telepresence rigs. We'll get buy-in from the biggest\r\nsuper-recommenders in the world, and we'll build something better and\r\nfaster than any ad-hoc ever has, without abandoning the original\r\nImagineers' vision. It will be unspeakably Bitchun.\"\r\n\r\nLil dropped her eyes and it was her turn to flush. She paced the floor,\r\nhands swinging at her sides. I could tell that she was still angry with\r\nme, but excited and scared and yes, passionate.\r\n\r\n\"It's not up to me, you know,\" she said at length, still pacing. Dan and\r\nI exchanged wicked grins. She was in.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" I said. But it was, almost -- she was a real opinion-leader in\r\nthe Liberty Square ad-hoc, someone who knew the systems back and forth,\r\nsomeone who made good, reasonable decisions and kept her head in a\r\ncrisis. Not a hothead. Not prone to taking radical switchbacks. This\r\nplan would burn up that reputation and the Whuffie that accompanied it,\r\nin short order, but by the time that happened, she'd have plenty of\r\nWhuffie with the new, thousands-strong ad-hoc.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, I can't guarantee anything. I'd like to study the plans that\r\nImagineering comes through with, do some walk-throughs --\"\r\n\r\nI started to object, to remind her that speed was of the essence, but\r\nshe beat me to it.\r\n\r\n\"But I won't. We have to move fast. I'm in.\"\r\n\r\nShe didn't come into my arms, didn't kiss me and tell me everything was\r\nforgiven, but she bought in, and that was enough.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nMy systems came back online sometime that day, and I hardly noticed, I\r\nwas so preoccupied with the new Mansion. Holy shit, was it ever\r\naudacious: since the first Mansion opened in California in 1969, no one\r\nhad ever had the guts to seriously fuxor with it. Oh, sure, the Paris\r\nversion, Phantom Manor, had a slightly different storyline, but it was\r\njust a minor bit of tweakage to satisfy the European market at the time.\r\nNo one wanted to screw up the legend.\r\n\r\nWhat the hell made the Mansion so cool, anyway? I'd been to Disney World\r\nany number of times as a guest before I settled in, and truth be told,\r\nit had never been my absolute favorite.\r\n\r\nBut when I returned to Disney World, live and in person, freshly bored\r\nstupid by the three-hour liveheaded flight from Toronto, I'd found\r\nmyself crowd-driven to it.\r\n\r\nI'm a terrible, terrible person to visit theme-parks with. Since I was a\r\npunk kid snaking my way through crowded subway platforms, eeling into\r\nthe only seat on a packed car, I'd been obsessed with Beating The Crowd.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Bitchun Society, I'd known a blackjack player,\r\na compulsive counter of cards, an idiot savant of odds. He was a pudgy,\r\nunassuming engineer, the moderately successful founder of a moderately\r\nsuccessful high-tech startup that had done something arcane with\r\nsoftware agents. While he was only moderately successful, he was\r\nfabulously wealthy: he'd never raised a cent of financing for his\r\ncompany, and had owned it outright when he finally sold it for a bathtub\r\nfull of money. His secret was the green felt tables of Vegas, where he'd\r\npilgrim off to every time his bank balance dropped, there to count the\r\nmonkey-cards and calculate the odds and Beat The House.\r\n\r\nLong after his software company was sold, long after he'd made his nut,\r\nhe was dressing up in silly disguises and hitting the tables, grinding\r\nout hand after hand of twenty-one, for the sheer satisfaction of Beating\r\nThe House. For him, it was pure brain-reward, a jolt of happy-juice\r\nevery time the dealer busted and every time he doubled down on a\r\ndeckfull of face cards.\r\n\r\nThough I'd never bought so much as a lottery ticket, I immediately got\r\nhis compulsion: for me, it was Beating The Crowd, finding the path of\r\nleast resistance, filling the gaps, guessing the short queue, dodging\r\nthe traffic, changing lanes with a whisper to spare -- moving with\r\nprecision and grace and, above all, _expedience_.\r\n\r\nOn that fateful return, I checked into the Fort Wilderness Campground,\r\npitched my tent, and fairly ran to the ferry docks to catch a barge over\r\nto the Main Gate.\r\n\r\nCrowds were light until I got right up to Main Gate and the ticketing\r\nqueues. Suppressing an initial instinct to dash for the farthest one,\r\nbeating my ferrymates to what rule-of-thumb said would have the shortest\r\nwait, I stepped back and did a quick visual survey of the twenty kiosks\r\nand evaluated the queued-up huddle in front of each. Pre-Bitchun, I'd\r\nhave been primarily interested in their ages, but that is less and less\r\na measure of anything other than outlook, so instead I carefully\r\nexamined their queuing styles, their dress, and more than anything,\r\ntheir burdens.\r\n\r\nYou can tell more about someone's ability to efficiently negotiate the\r\ncomplexities of a queue through what they carry than through any other\r\nmeans -- if only more people realized it. The classic, of course, is the\r\nunladen citizen, a person naked of even a modest shoulderbag or\r\nmarsupial pocket. To the layperson, such a specimen might be thought of\r\nas a sure bet for a fast transaction, but I'd done an informal study and\r\ncome to the conclusion that these brave iconoclasts are often the\r\nflightiest of the lot, left smiling with bovine mystification, patting\r\ndown their pockets in a fruitless search for a writing implement, a\r\npiece of ID, a keycard, a rabbit's foot, a rosary, a tuna sandwich.\r\n\r\nNo, for my money, I'll take what I call the Road Worrier anytime. Such a\r\nperson is apt to be carefully slung with four or five carriers of one\r\ndescription or another, from bulging cargo pockets to clever military-\r\ngrade strap-on pouches with biometrically keyed closures. The thing to\r\nwatch for is the ergonomic consideration given to these conveyances: do\r\nthey balance, are they slung for minimum interference and maximum ease\r\nof access? Someone who's given that much consideration to their gear is\r\nlikely spending their time in line determining which bits and pieces\r\nthey'll need when they reach its headwaters and is holding them at ready\r\nfor fastest-possible processing.\r\n\r\nThis is a tricky call, since there are lookalike pretenders, gear-pigs\r\nwho pack _everything_ because they lack the organizational smarts to\r\nfigure out what they should pack -- they're just as apt to be burdened\r\nwith bags and pockets and pouches, but the telltale is the efficiency of\r\nthat slinging. These pack mules will sag beneath their loads, juggling\r\nthis and that while pushing overloose straps up on their shoulders.\r\n\r\nI spied a queue that was made up of a group of Road Worriers, a queue\r\nthat was slightly longer than the others, but I joined it and ticced\r\nnervously as I watched my progress relative to the other spots I\r\ncould've chosen. I was borne out, a positive omen for a wait-free World,\r\nand I was sauntering down Main Street, USA long before my ferrymates.\r\n\r\nReturning to Walt Disney World was a homecoming for me. My parents had\r\nbrought me the first time when I was all of ten, just as the first\r\ninklings of the Bitchun society were trickling into everyone's\r\nconsciousness: the death of scarcity, the death of death, the struggle\r\nto rejig an economy that had grown up focused on nothing but scarcity\r\nand death. My memories of the trip are dim but warm, the balmy Florida\r\nclimate and a sea of smiling faces punctuated by magical, darkened\r\nmoments riding in OmniMover cars, past diorama after diorama.\r\n\r\nI went again when I graduated high school and was amazed by the richness\r\nof detail, the grandiosity and grandeur of it all. I spent a week there\r\nstunned bovine, grinning and wandering from corner to corner. Someday, I\r\nknew, I'd come to live there.\r\n\r\nThe Park became a touchstone for me, a constant in a world where\r\neverything changed. Again and again, I came back to the Park, grounding\r\nmyself, communing with all the people I'd been.\r\n\r\nThat day I bopped from land to land, ride to ride, seeking out the short\r\nlines, the eye of the hurricane that crowded the Park to capacity. I'd\r\ntake high ground, standing on a bench or hopping up on a fence, and do a\r\nvisual reccy of all the queues in sight, try to spot prevailing currents\r\nin the flow of the crowd, generally having a high old obsessive time.\r\nTruth be told, I probably spent as much time looking for walk-ins as I\r\nwould've spent lining up like a good little sheep, but I had more fun\r\nand got more exercise.\r\n\r\nThe Haunted Mansion was experiencing a major empty spell: the Snow Crash\r\nSpectacular parade had just swept through Liberty Square en route to\r\nFantasyland, dragging hordes of guests along with it, dancing to the\r\nJapRap sounds of the comical Sushi-K and aping the movements of the\r\nbrave Hiro Protagonist. When they blew out, Liberty Square was a ghost\r\ntown, and I grabbed the opportunity to ride the Mansion five times in a\r\nrow, walking on every time.\r\n\r\nThe way I tell it to Lil, I noticed her and then I noticed the Mansion,\r\nbut to tell the truth it was the other way around.\r\n\r\nThe first couple rides through, I was just glad of the aggressive air\r\nconditioning and the delicious sensation of sweat drying on my skin. But\r\non the third pass, I started to notice just how goddamn cool the thing\r\nwas. There wasn't a single bit of tech more advanced than a film-loop\r\nprojector in the whole place, but it was all so cunningly contrived that\r\nthe illusion of a haunted house was perfect: the ghosts that whirled\r\nthrough the ballroom were _ghosts_, three-dimensional and ethereal and\r\nphantasmic. The ghosts that sang in comical tableaux through the\r\ngraveyard were equally convincing, genuinely witty and simultaneously\r\ncreepy.\r\n\r\nMy fourth pass through, I noticed the _detail_, the hostile eyes worked\r\ninto the wallpaper's pattern, the motif repeated in the molding, the\r\nchandeliers, the photo gallery. I began to pick out the words to \"Grim\r\nGrinning Ghosts,\" the song that is repeated throughout the ride, whether\r\nin sinister organ-tones repeating the main theme troppo troppo or the\r\nspritely singing of the four musical busts in the graveyard.\r\n\r\nIt's a catchy tune, one that I hummed on my fifth pass through, this\r\ntime noticing that the overaggressive AC was, actually, mysterious\r\nchills that blew through the rooms as wandering spirits made their\r\npresence felt. By the time I debarked for the fifth time, I was\r\nwhistling the tune with jazzy improvisations in a mixed-up tempo.\r\n\r\nThat's when Lil and I ran into each other. She was picking up a\r\ndiscarded ice-cream wrapper -- I'd seen a dozen castmembers picking up\r\ntrash that day, seen it so frequently that I'd started doing it myself.\r\nShe grinned slyly at me as I debarked into the fried-food-and-\r\ndisinfectant perfume of the Park, hands in pockets, thoroughly pleased\r\nwith myself for having so completely _experienced_ a really fine hunk of\r\nart.\r\n\r\nI smiled back at her, because it was only natural that one of the\r\nWhuffie-kings who were privileged to tend this bit of heavenly\r\nentertainment should notice how thoroughly I was enjoying her work.\r\n\r\n\"That's really, really Bitchun,\" I said to her, admiring the titanic\r\nmountains of Whuffie my HUD attributed to her.\r\n\r\nShe was in character, and not supposed to be cheerful, but castmembers\r\nof her generation can't help but be friendly. She compromised between\r\nghastly demeanor and her natural sweet spirit, and leered a grin at me,\r\nthumped through a zombie's curtsey, and moaned \"Thank you -- we _do_ try\r\nto keep it _spirited_.\"\r\n\r\nI groaned appreciatively, and started to notice just how very cute she\r\nwas, this little button of a girl with her rotting maid's uniform and\r\nher feather-shedding duster. She was just so clean and scrubbed and\r\nhappy about everything, she radiated it and made me want to pinch her\r\ncheeks -- either set.\r\n\r\nThe moment was on me, and so I said, \"When do they let you ghouls off?\r\nI'd love to take you out for a Zombie or a Bloody Mary.\"\r\n\r\nWhich led to more horrifying banter, and to my taking her out for a\r\ncouple at the Adventurer's Club, learning her age in the process and\r\nlosing my nerve, telling myself that there was nothing we could possibly\r\nhave to say to each other across a century-wide gap.\r\n\r\nWhile I tell Lil that I noticed her first and the Mansion second, the\r\nreverse is indeed true. But it's also true -- and I never told her this\r\n-- that the thing I love best about the Mansion is:\r\n\r\nIt's where I met her.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDan and I spent the day riding the Mansion, drafting scripts for the\r\ntelepresence players who we hoped to bring on-board. We were in a\r\ntotally creative zone, the dialog running as fast as he could transcribe\r\nit. Jamming on ideas with Dan was just about as terrific as a pass-time\r\ncould be.\r\n\r\nI was all for leaking the plan to the Net right away, getting hearts-\r\nand-minds action with our core audience, but Lil turned it down.\r\n\r\nShe was going to spend the next couple days quietly politicking among\r\nthe rest of the ad-hoc, getting some support for the idea, and she\r\ndidn't want the appearance of impropriety that would come from having\r\noutsiders being brought in before the ad-hoc.\r\n\r\nTalking to the ad-hocs, bringing them around -- it was a skill I'd never\r\nreally mastered. Dan was good at it, Lil was good at it, but me, I think\r\nthat I was too self-centered to ever develop good skills as a\r\npeacemaker. In my younger days, I assumed that it was because I was\r\nsmarter than everyone else, with no patience for explaining things in\r\nshort words for mouth-breathers who just didn't get it.\r\n\r\nThe truth of the matter is, I'm a bright enough guy, but I'm hardly a\r\ngenius. Especially when it comes to people. Probably comes from Beating\r\nThe Crowd, never seeing individuals, just the mass -- the enemy of\r\nexpedience.\r\n\r\nI never would have made it into the Liberty Square ad-hoc on my own. Lil\r\nmade it happen for me, long before we started sleeping together. I'd\r\nassumed that her folks would be my best allies in the process of joining\r\nup, but they were too jaded, too ready to take the long sleep to pay\r\nmuch attention to a newcomer like me.\r\n\r\nLil took me under her wing, inviting me to after-work parties, talking\r\nme up to her cronies, quietly passing around copies of my thesis-work.\r\nAnd she did the same in reverse, sincerely extolling the virtues of the\r\nothers I met, so that I knew what there was to respect about them and\r\ncouldn't help but treat them as individuals.\r\n\r\nIn the years since, I'd lost that respect. Mostly, I palled around with\r\nLil, and once he arrived, Dan, and with net-friends around the world.\r\nThe ad-hocs that I worked with all day treated me with basic courtesy\r\nbut not much friendliness.\r\n\r\nI guess I treated them the same. When I pictured them in my mind, they\r\nwere a faceless, passive-aggressive mass, too caught up in the starchy\r\nworld of consensus-building to ever do much of anything.\r\n\r\nDan and I threw ourselves into it headlong, trolling the Net for address\r\nlists of Mansion-otakus from the four corners of the globe,\r\nspreadsheeting them against their timezones, temperaments, and, of\r\ncourse, their Whuffie.\r\n\r\n\"That's weird,\" I said, looking up from the old-fashioned terminal I was\r\nusing -- my systems were back offline. They'd been sputtering up and\r\ndown for a couple days now, and I kept meaning to go to the doctor, but\r\nI'd never gotten 'round to it. Periodically, I'd get a jolt of urgency\r\nwhen I remembered that this meant my backup was stale-dating, but the\r\nMansion always took precedence.\r\n\r\n\"Huh?\" he said.\r\n\r\nI tapped the display. \"See these?\" It was a fan-site, displaying a\r\ncollection of animated 3-D meshes of various elements of the Mansion,\r\npart of a giant collaborative project that had been ongoing for decades,\r\nto build an accurate 3-D walkthrough of every inch of the Park. I'd used\r\nthose meshes to build my own testing fly-throughs.\r\n\r\n\"Those are terrific,\" Dan said. \"That guy must be a total _fiend_.\" The\r\nmeshes' author had painstakingly modeled, chained and animated every\r\nghost in the ballroom scene, complete with the kinematics necessary for\r\nfull motion. Where a \"normal\" fan-artist might've used a standard human\r\nkinematics library for the figures, this one had actually written his\r\nown from the ground up, so that the ghosts moved with a spectral\r\nfluidity that was utterly unhuman.\r\n\r\n\"Who's the author?\" Dan asked. \"Do we have him on our list yet?\"\r\n\r\nI scrolled down to display the credits. \"I'll be damned,\" Dan breathed.\r\n\r\nThe author was Tim, Debra's elfin crony. He'd submitted the designs a\r\nweek before my assassination.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think it means?\" I asked Dan, though I had a couple ideas\r\non the subject myself.\r\n\r\n\"Tim's a Mansion nut,\" Dan said. \"I knew that.\"\r\n\r\n\"You knew?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked a little defensive. \"Sure. I told you, back when you had me\r\nhanging out with Debra's gang.\"\r\n\r\nHad I asked him to hang out with Debra? As I remembered it, it had been\r\nhis suggestion. Too much to think about.\r\n\r\n\"But what does it mean, Dan? Is he an ally? Should we try to recruit\r\nhim? Or is he the one that'd convinced Debra she needs to take over the\r\nMansion?\"\r\n\r\nDan shook his head. \"I'm not even sure that she wants to take over the\r\nMansion. I know Debra, all she wants to do is turn ideas into things, as\r\nfast and as copiously as possible. She picks her projects carefully.\r\nShe's acquisitive, sure, but she's cautious. She had a great idea for\r\nPresidents, and so she took over. I never heard her talk about the\r\nMansion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you didn't. She's cagey. Did you hear her talk about the Hall\r\nof Presidents?\"\r\n\r\nDan fumbled. \"Not really. . . I mean, not in so many words, but --\"\r\n\r\n\"But nothing,\" I said. \"She's after the Mansion, she's after the Magic\r\nKingdom, she's after the Park. She's taking over, goddamn it, and I'm\r\nthe only one who seems to have noticed.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI came clean to Lil about my systems that night, as we were fighting.\r\nFighting had become our regular evening pastime, and Dan had taken to\r\nsleeping at one of the hotels on-site rather than endure it.\r\n\r\nI'd started it, of course. \"We're going to get killed if we don't get\r\noff our asses and start the rehab,\" I said, slamming myself down on the\r\nsofa and kicking at the scratched coffee table. I heard the hysteria and\r\nunreason in my voice and it just made me madder. I was frustrated by not\r\nbeing able to check in on Suneep and Dan, and, as usual, it was too late\r\nat night to call anyone and do anything about it. By the morning, I'd\r\nhave forgotten again.\r\n\r\nFrom the kitchen, Lil barked back, \"I'm doing what I can, Jules. If\r\nyou've got a better way, I'd love to hear about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, bullshit. I'm doing what I can, planning the thing out. I'm ready\r\nto _go_. It was your job to get the ad-hocs ready for it, but you keep\r\ntelling me they're not. When will they be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Jesus, you're a nag.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't nag if you'd only fucking make it happen. What are you doing\r\nall day, anyway? Working shifts at the Mansion? Rearranging deck chairs\r\non the Great Titanic Adventure?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm working my fucking _ass_ off. I've spoken to every goddamn one of\r\nthem at least twice this week about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" I hollered at the kitchen. \"Sure you have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't take my word for it, then. Check my fucking phone logs.\"\r\n\r\nShe waited.\r\n\r\n\"Well? Check them!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll check them later,\" I said, dreading where this was going.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no you _don't_,\" she said, stalking into the room, fuming. \"You\r\ncan't call me a liar and then refuse to look at the evidence.\" She\r\nplanted her hands on her slim little hips and glared at me. She'd gone\r\npale and I could count every freckle on her face, her throat, her\r\ncollarbones, the swell of her cleavage in the old vee-neck shirt I'd\r\ngiven her on a day-trip to Nassau.\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" she asked. She looked ready to wring my neck.\r\n\r\n\"I can't,\" I admitted, not meeting her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes you can -- here, I'll dump it to your public directory.\"\r\n\r\nHer expression shifted to one of puzzlement when she failed to locate me\r\non her network. \"What's going on?\"\r\n\r\nSo I told her. Offline, outcast, malfunctioning.\r\n\r\n\"Well, why haven't you gone to the doctor? I mean, it's been _weeks_.\r\nI'll call him right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forget it,\" I said. \"I'll see him tomorrow. No sense in getting him out\r\nof bed.\"\r\n\r\nBut I didn't see him the day after, or the day after that. Too much to\r\ndo, and the only times I remembered to call someone, I was too far from\r\na public terminal or it was too late or too early. My systems came\r\nonline a couple times, and I was too busy with the plans for the\r\nMansion. Lil grew accustomed to the drifts of hard copy that littered\r\nthe house, to printing out her annotations to my designs and leaving\r\nthem on my favorite chair -- to living like the cavemen of the\r\ninformation age had, surrounded by dead trees and ticking clocks.\r\n\r\nBeing offline helped me focus. Focus is hardly the word for it -- I\r\nobsessed. I sat in front of the terminal I'd brought home all day, every\r\nday, crunching plans, dictating voicemail. People who wanted to reach me\r\nhad to haul ass out to the house, and _speak_ to me.\r\n\r\nI grew too obsessed to fight, and Dan moved back, and then it was my\r\nturn to take hotel rooms so that the rattle of my keyboard wouldn't keep\r\nhim up nights. He and Lil were working a full-time campaign to recruit\r\nthe ad-hoc to our cause, and I started to feel like we were finally in\r\nharmony, about to reach our goal.\r\n\r\nI went home one afternoon clutching a sheaf of hardcopy and burst into\r\nthe living room, gabbling a mile-a-minute about a wrinkle on my original\r\nplan that would add a third walk-through segment to the ride, increasing\r\nthe number of telepresence rigs we could use without decreasing\r\nthroughput.\r\n\r\nI was mid-babble when my systems came back online. The public chatter in\r\nthe room sprang up on my HUD.\r\n\r\n_And then I'm going to tear off every stitch of clothing and jump you._\r\n\r\n_And then what?_\r\n\r\n_I'm going to bang you till you limp. _\r\n\r\n_Jesus, Lil, you are one rangy cowgirl._\r\n\r\nMy eyes closed, shutting out everything except for the glowing letters.\r\nQuickly, they vanished. I opened my eyes again, looking at Lil, who was\r\nflushed and distracted. Dan looked scared.\r\n\r\n\"What's going on, Dan?\" I asked quietly. My heart hammered in my chest,\r\nbut I felt calm and detached.\r\n\r\n\"Jules,\" he began, then gave up and looked at Lil.\r\n\r\nLil had, by that time, figured out that I was back online, that their\r\nsecret messaging had been discovered.\r\n\r\n\"Having fun, Lil?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nLil shook her head and glared at me. \"Just go, Julius. I'll send your\r\nstuff to the hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"You want me to go, huh? So you can bang him till he limps?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is my house, Julius. I'm asking you to get out of it. I'll see you\r\nat work tomorrow -- we're having a general ad-hoc meeting to vote on the\r\nrehab.\"\r\n\r\nIt was her house.\r\n\r\n\"Lil, Julius --\" Dan began.\r\n\r\n\"This is between me and him,\" Lil said. \"Stay out of it.\"\r\n\r\nI dropped my papers -- I wanted to throw them, but I dropped them,\r\n_flump_, and I turned on my heel and walked out, not bothering to close\r\nthe door behind me.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDan showed up at the hotel ten minutes after I did and rapped on my\r\ndoor. I was all-over numb as I opened the door. He had a bottle of\r\ntequila -- _my_ tequila, brought over from the house that I'd shared\r\nwith Lil.\r\n\r\nHe sat down on the bed and stared at the logo-marked wallpaper. I took\r\nthe bottle from him, got a couple glasses from the bathroom and poured.\r\n\r\n\"It's my fault,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure it is,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"We got to drinking a couple nights ago. She was really upset. Hadn't\r\nseen you in days, and when she _did_ see you, you freaked her out.\r\nSnapping at her. Arguing. Insulting her.\"\r\n\r\n\"So you made her,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head, then nodded, took a drink. \"I did. It's been a long\r\ntime since I. . .\"\r\n\r\n\"You had sex with my girlfriend, in my house, while I was away,\r\nworking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jules, I'm sorry. I did it, and I kept on doing it. I'm not much of a\r\nfriend to either of you.\r\n\r\n\"She's pretty broken up. She wanted me to come out here and tell you it\r\nwas all a mistake, that you were just being paranoid.\"\r\n\r\nWe sat in silence for a long time. I refilled his glass, then my own.\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't do that,\" he said. \"I'm worried about you. You haven't been\r\nright, not for months. I don't know what it is, but you should get to a\r\ndoctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't need a doctor,\" I snapped. The liquor had melted the numbness\r\nand left burning anger and bile, my constant companions. \"I need a\r\nfriend who doesn't fuck my girlfriend when my back is turned.\"\r\n\r\nI threw my glass at the wall. It bounced off, leaving tequila-stains on\r\nthe wallpaper, and rolled under the bed. Dan started, but stayed seated.\r\nIf he'd stood up, I would've hit him. Dan's good at crises.\r\n\r\n\"If it's any consolation, I expect to be dead pretty soon,\" he said. He\r\ngave me a wry grin. \"My Whuffie's doing good. This rehab should take it\r\nup over the top. I'll be ready to go.\"\r\n\r\nThat stopped me. I'd somehow managed to forget that Dan, my good friend\r\nDan, was going to kill himself.\r\n\r\n\"You're going to do it,\" I said, sitting down next to him. It hurt to\r\nthink about it. I really liked the bastard. He might've been my best\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nThere was a knock at the door. I opened it without checking the\r\npeephole. It was Lil.\r\n\r\nShe looked younger than ever. Young and small and miserable. A snide\r\nremark died in my throat. I wanted to hold her.\r\n\r\nShe brushed past me and went to Dan, who squirmed out of her embrace.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, and stood up and sat on the windowsill, staring down at\r\nthe Seven Seas Lagoon.\r\n\r\n\"Dan's just been explaining to me that he plans on being dead in a\r\ncouple months,\" I said. \"Puts a damper on the long-term plans, doesn't\r\nit, Lil?\"\r\n\r\nTears streamed down her face and she seemed to fold in on herself. \"I'll\r\ntake what I can get,\" she said.\r\n\r\nI choked on a knob of misery, and I realized that it was Dan, not Lil,\r\nwhose loss upset me the most.\r\n\r\nLil took Dan's hand and led him out of the room.\r\n\r\n_I guess I'll take what I can get, too_, I thought.\r\n\r\n========= CHAPTER 6 =========\r\n\r\nLying on my hotel bed, mesmerized by the lazy turns of the ceiling fan,\r\nI pondered the possibility that I was nuts.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't unheard of, even in the days of the Bitchun Society, and even\r\nthough there were cures, they weren't pleasant.\r\n\r\nI was once married to a crazy person. We were both about 70, and I was\r\nliving for nothing but joy. Her name was Zoya, and I called her Zed.\r\n\r\nWe met in orbit, where I'd gone to experience the famed low-gravity\r\nsybarites. Getting staggering drunk is not much fun at one gee, but at\r\nten to the neg eight, it's a blast. You don't stagger, you _bounce_, and\r\nwhen you're bouncing in a sphere full of other bouncing, happy,\r\nboisterous naked people, things get deeply fun.\r\n\r\nI was bouncing around inside a clear sphere that was a mile in diameter,\r\nfilled with smaller spheres in which one could procure bulbs of fruity,\r\ndeadly concoctions. Musical instruments littered the sphere's floor, and\r\nif you knew how to play, you'd snag one, tether it to you and start\r\nplaying. Others would pick up their own axes and jam along. The tunes\r\nvaried from terrific to awful, but they were always energetic.\r\n\r\nI had been working on my third symphony on and off, and whenever I\r\nthought I had a nice bit nailed, I'd spend some time in the sphere\r\nplaying it. Sometimes, the strangers who jammed in gave me new and\r\ninteresting lines of inquiry, and that was good. Even when they didn't,\r\nplaying an instrument was a fast track to intriguing an interesting,\r\nnaked stranger.\r\n\r\nWhich is how we met. She snagged a piano and pounded out barrelhouse\r\nruns in quirky time as I carried the main thread of the movement on a\r\ncello. At first it was irritating, but after a short while I came to a\r\ndawning comprehension of what she was doing to my music, and it was\r\nreally _good_. I'm a sucker for musicians.\r\n\r\nWe brought the session to a crashing stop, me bowing furiously as\r\nspheres of perspiration beaded on my body and floated gracefully into\r\nthe hydrotropic recyclers, she beating on the 88 like they were the perp\r\nwho killed her partner.\r\n\r\nI collapsed dramatically as the last note crashed through the bubble.\r\nThe singles, couples and groups stopped in midflight coitus to applaud.\r\nShe took a bow, untethered herself from the Steinway, and headed for the\r\nhatch.\r\n\r\nI coiled my legs up and did a fast burn through the sphere, desperate to\r\nreach the hatch before she did. I caught her as she was leaving.\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" I said. \"That was great! I'm Julius! How're you doing?\"\r\n\r\nShe reached out with both hands and squeezed my nose and my unit\r\nsimultaneously -- not hard, you understand, but playfully. \"Honk!\" she\r\nsaid, and squirmed through the hatch while I gaped at my burgeoning\r\nchub-on.\r\n\r\nI chased after her. \"Wait,\" I called as she tumbled through the spoke of\r\nthe station towards the gravity.\r\n\r\nShe had a pianist's body -- re-engineered arms and hands that stretched\r\nfor impossible lengths, and she used them with a spacehand's grace,\r\nvaulting herself forward at speed. I bumbled after her best as I could\r\non my freshman spacelegs, but by the time I reached the half-gee rim of\r\nthe station, she was gone.\r\n\r\nI didn't find her again until the next movement was done and I went to\r\nthe bubble to try it out on an oboe. I was just getting warmed up when\r\nshe passed through the hatch and tied off to the piano.\r\n\r\nThis time, I clamped the oboe under my arm and bopped over to her before\r\nmoistening the reed and blowing. I hovered over the piano's top, looking\r\nher in the eye as we jammed. Her mood that day was 4/4 time and I-IV-V\r\nprogressions, in a feel that swung around from blues to rock to folk,\r\nteasing at the edge of my own melodies. She noodled at me, I noodled\r\nback at her, and her eyes crinkled charmingly whenever I managed a\r\nsmidge of tuneful wit.\r\n\r\nShe was almost completely flatchested, and covered in a fine, red downy\r\nfur, like a chipmunk. It was a jaunter's style, suited to the climate-\r\ncontrolled, soft-edged life in space. Fifty years later, I was dating\r\nLil, another redhead, but Zed was my first.\r\n\r\nI played and played, entranced by the fluidity of her movements at the\r\nkeyboard, her comical moues of concentration when picking out a\r\nparticularly kicky little riff. When I got tired, I took it to a slow\r\nbridge or gave her a solo. I was going to make this last as long as I\r\ncould. Meanwhile, I maneuvered my way between her and the hatch.\r\n\r\nWhen I blew the last note, I was wrung out as a washcloth, but I\r\nsummoned the energy to zip over to the hatch and block it. She calmly\r\nuntied and floated over to me.\r\n\r\nI looked in her eyes, silvered slanted cat-eyes, eyes that I'd been\r\nstaring into all afternoon, and watched the smile that started at their\r\ncorners and spread right down to her long, elegant toes. She looked back\r\nat me, then, at length, grabbed ahold of my joint again.\r\n\r\n\"You'll do,\" she said, and led me to her sleeping quarters, across the\r\nstation.\r\n\r\nWe didn't sleep.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nZoya had been an early network engineer for the geosynch broadband\r\nconstellations that went up at the cusp of the world's ascent into\r\nBitchunry. She'd been exposed to a lot of hard rads and low gee and had\r\ngenerally become pretty transhuman as time went by, upgrading with a\r\nbewildering array of third-party enhancements: a vestigial tail, eyes\r\nthat saw through most of the RF spectrum, her arms, her fur, dogleg\r\nreversible knee joints and a completely mechanical spine that wasn't\r\nprone to any of the absolutely inane bullshit that plagues the rest of\r\nus, like lower-back pain, intrascapular inflammation, sciatica and\r\nslipped discs.\r\n\r\nI thought I lived for fun, but I didn't have anything on Zed. She only\r\ntalked when honking and whistling and grabbing and kissing wouldn't do,\r\nand routinely slapped upgrades into herself on the basis of any whim\r\nthat crossed her mind, like when she resolved to do a spacewalk bare-\r\nskinned and spent the afternoon getting tin-plated and iron-lunged.\r\n\r\nI fell in love with her a hundred times a day, and wanted to strangle\r\nher twice as often. She stayed on her spacewalk for a couple of days,\r\nfloating around the bubble, making crazy faces at its mirrored exterior.\r\nShe had no way of knowing if I was inside, but she assumed that I was\r\nwatching. Or maybe she didn't, and she was making faces for anyone's\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\nBut then she came back through the lock, strange and wordless and her\r\neyes full of the stars she'd seen and her metallic skin cool with the\r\nbreath of empty space, and she led me a merry game of tag through the\r\nstation, the mess hall where we skidded sloppy through a wobbly ovoid of\r\nrice pudding, the greenhouses where she burrowed like a gopher and\r\nshinnied like a monkey, the living quarters and bubbles as we\r\ninterrupted a thousand acts of coitus.\r\n\r\nYou'd have thought that we'd have followed it up with an act of our own,\r\nand truth be told, that was certainly my expectation when we started the\r\ngame I came to think of as the steeplechase, but we never did. Halfway\r\nthrough, I'd lose track of carnal urges and return to a state of\r\nchildlike innocence, living only for the thrill of the chase and the\r\ngiggly feeling I got whenever she found some new, even-more-outrageous\r\ncorner to turn. I think we became legendary on the station, that crazy\r\npair that's always zipping in and zipping away, like having your party\r\ncrashed by two naked, coed Marx Brothers.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked her to marry me, to return to Earth with me, to live with\r\nme until the universe's mainspring unwound, she laughed, honked my nose\r\nand my willie and shouted, \"YOU'LL _DO_!\"\r\n\r\nI took her home to Toronto and we took up residence ten stories\r\nunderground in overflow residence for the University. Our Whuffie wasn't\r\nso hot earthside, and the endless institutional corridors made her feel\r\nat home while affording her opportunities for mischief.\r\n\r\nBut bit by bit, the mischief dwindled, and she started talking more. At\r\nfirst, I admit I was relieved, glad that my strange, silent wife was\r\nfinally acting normal, making nice with the neighbors instead of\r\npranking them with endless honks and fanny-kicks and squirt guns. We\r\ngave up the steeplechase and she had the doglegs taken out, her fur\r\nremoved, her eyes unsilvered to a hazel that was pretty and as\r\nfathomable as the silver had been inscrutable.\r\n\r\nWe wore clothes. We entertained. I started to rehearse my symphony in\r\nlow-Whuffie halls and parks with any musicians I could drum up, and she\r\ncame out and didn't play, just sat to the side and smiled and smiled\r\nwith a smile that never went beyond her lips.\r\n\r\nShe went nuts.\r\n\r\nShe shat herself. She pulled her hair. She cut herself with knives. She\r\naccused me of plotting to kill her. She set fire to the neighbors'\r\napartments, wrapped herself in plastic sheeting, dry-humped the\r\nfurniture.\r\n\r\nShe went nuts. She did it in broad strokes, painting the walls of our\r\nbedroom with her blood, jagging all night through rant after rant. I\r\nsmiled and nodded and faced it for as long as I could, then I grabbed\r\nher and hauled her, kicking like a mule, to the doctor's office on the\r\nsecond floor. She'd been dirtside for a year and nuts for a month, but\r\nit took me that long to face up to it.\r\n\r\nThe doc diagnosed nonchemical dysfunction, which was by way of saying\r\nthat it was her mind, not her brain, that was broken. In other words,\r\nI'd driven her nuts.\r\n\r\nYou can get counseling for nonchemical dysfunction, basically trying to\r\ntalk it out, learn to feel better about yourself. She didn't want to.\r\n\r\nShe was miserable, suicidal, murderous. In the brief moments of lucidity\r\nthat she had under sedation, she consented to being restored from a\r\nbackup that was made before we came to Toronto.\r\n\r\nI was at her side in the hospital when she woke up. I had prepared a\r\nwritten synopsis of the events since her last backup for her, and she\r\nread it over the next couple days.\r\n\r\n\"Julius,\" she said, while I was making breakfast in our subterranean\r\napartment. She sounded so serious, so fun-free, that I knew immediately\r\nthat the news wouldn't be good.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" I said, setting out plates of bacon and eggs, steaming cups of\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to go back to space, and revert to an older version.\" She had\r\na shoulderbag packed, and she had traveling clothes on.\r\n\r\n_Oh, shit._ \"Great,\" I said, with forced cheerfulness, making a mental\r\ninventory of my responsibilities dirtside. \"Give me a minute or two,\r\nI'll pack up. I miss space, too.\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, and anger blazed in her utterly scrutable hazel\r\neyes. \"No. I'm going back to who I was, before I met you.\"\r\n\r\nIt hurt, bad. I had loved the old, steeplechase Zed, had loved her fun\r\nand mischief. The Zed she'd become after we wed was terrible and\r\nterrifying, but I'd stuck with her out of respect for the person she'd\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nNow she was off to restore herself from a backup made before she met me.\r\nShe was going to lop 18 months out of her life, start over again, revert\r\nto a saved version.\r\n\r\nHurt? It ached like a motherfucker.\r\n\r\nI went back to the station a month later, and saw her jamming in the\r\nsphere with a guy who had three extra sets of arms depending from his\r\nhips. He scuttled around the sphere while she played a jig on the piano,\r\nand when her silver eyes lit on me, there wasn't a shred of recognition\r\nin them. She'd never met me.\r\n\r\nI died some, too, putting the incident out of my head and sojourning to\r\nDisney World, there to reinvent myself with a new group of friends, a\r\nnew career, a new life. I never spoke of Zed again -- especially not to\r\nLil, who hardly needed me to pollute her with remembrances of my crazy\r\nexes.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nIf I was nuts, it wasn't the kind of spectacular nuts that Zed had gone.\r\nIt was a slow, seething, ugly nuts that had me alienating my friends,\r\nsabotaging my enemies, driving my girlfriend into my best friend's arms.\r\n\r\nI decided that I would see a doctor, just as soon as we'd run the rehab\r\npast the ad-hoc's general meeting. I had to get my priorities straight.\r\n\r\nI pulled on last night's clothes and walked out to the Monorail station\r\nin the main lobby. The platform was jammed with happy guests, bright and\r\ncheerful and ready for a day of steady, hypermediated fun. I tried to\r\nmake myself attend to them as individuals, but try as I might, they kept\r\nturning into a crowd, and I had to plant my feet firmly on the platform\r\nto keep from weaving among them to the edge, the better to snag a seat.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was being held over the Sunshine Tree Terrace in\r\nAdventureland, just steps from where I'd been turned into a road-pizza\r\nby the still-unidentified assassin. The Adventureland ad-hocs owed the\r\nLiberty Square crew a favor since my death had gone down on their turf,\r\nso they had given us use of their prize meeting room, where the Florida\r\nsun streamed through the slats of the shutters, casting a hash of dust-\r\nfilled shafts of light across the room. The faint sounds of the tiki-\r\ndrums and the spieling Jungle Cruise guides leaked through the room, a\r\nlow-key ambient buzz from two of the Park's oldest rides.\r\n\r\nThere were almost a hundred ad-hocs in the Liberty Square crew, almost\r\nall second-gen castmembers with big, friendly smiles. They filled the\r\nroom to capacity, and there was much hugging and handshaking before the\r\nmeeting came to order. I was thankful that the room was too small for\r\nthe _de rigeur_ ad-hoc circle-of-chairs, so that Lil was able to stand\r\nat a podium and command a smidge of respect.\r\n\r\n\"Hi there!\" she said, brightly. The weepy puffiness was still present\r\naround her eyes, if you knew how to look for it, but she was expert at\r\nputting on a brave face no matter what the ache.\r\n\r\nThe ad-hocs roared back a collective, \"Hi, Lil!\" and laughed at their\r\nown corny tradition. Oh, they sure were a barrel of laughs at the Magic\r\nKingdom.\r\n\r\n\"Everybody knows why we're here, right?\" Lil said, with a self-\r\ndeprecating smile. She'd been lobbying hard for weeks, after all. \"Does\r\nanyone have any questions about the plans? We'd like to start executing\r\nright away.\"\r\n\r\nA guy with deliberately boyish, wholesome features put his arm in the\r\nair. Lil acknowledged him with a nod. \"When you say 'right away,' do you\r\nmean --\"\r\n\r\nI cut in. \"Tonight. After this meeting. We're on an eight-week\r\nproduction schedule, and the sooner we start, the sooner it'll be\r\nfinished.\"\r\n\r\nThe crowd murmured, unsettled. Lil shot me a withering look. I shrugged.\r\nPolitics was not my game.\r\n\r\nLil said, \"Don, we're trying something new here, a really streamlined\r\nprocess. The good part is, the process is _short_. In a couple months,\r\nwe'll know if it's working for us. If it's not, hey, we can turn it\r\naround in a couple months, too. That's why we're not spending as much\r\ntime planning as we usually do. It won't take five years for the idea to\r\nprove out, so the risks are lower.\"\r\n\r\nAnother castmember, a woman, apparent 40 with a round, motherly demeanor\r\nsaid, \"I'm all for moving fast -- Lord knows, our pacing hasn't always\r\nbeen that hot. But I'm concerned about all these new people you propose\r\nto recruit -- won't having more people slow us down when it comes to\r\nmaking new decisions?\"\r\n\r\n_No_, I thought sourly, _because the people I'm bringing in aren't\r\naddicted to meetings_.\r\n\r\nLil nodded. \"That's a good point, Lisa. The offer we're making to the\r\ntelepresence players is probationary -- they don't get to vote until\r\nafter we've agreed that the rehab is a success.\"\r\n\r\nAnother castmember stood. I recognized him: Dave, a heavyset, self-\r\nimportant jerk who loved to work the front door, even though he blew his\r\nspiel about half the time. \"Lillian,\" he said, smiling sadly at her, \"I\r\nthink you're really making a big mistake here. We love the Mansion, all\r\nof us, and so do the guests. It's a piece of history, and we're its\r\ncustodians, not its masters. Changing it like this, well. . .\" he shook\r\nhis head. \"It's not good stewardship. If the guests wanted to walk\r\nthrough a funhouse with guys jumping out of the shadows saying 'booga-\r\nbooga,' they'd go to one of the Halloween Houses in their hometowns. The\r\nMansion's better than that. I can't be a part of this plan.\"\r\n\r\nI wanted to knock the smug grin off his face. I'd delivered essentially\r\nthe same polemic a thousand times -- in reference to Debra's work -- and\r\nhearing it from this jerk in reference to _mine_ made me go all hot and\r\nred inside.\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" I said. \"If we don't do this, if we don't change things, they'll\r\nget changed _for_ us. By someone else. The question, _Dave_, is whether\r\na responsible custodian lets his custodianship be taken away from him,\r\nor whether he does everything he can to make sure that he's still around\r\nto ensure that his charge is properly cared for. Good custodianship\r\nisn't sticking your head in the sand.\"\r\n\r\nI could tell I wasn't doing any good. The mood of the crowd was getting\r\ndarker, the faces more set. I resolved not to speak again until the\r\nmeeting was done, no matter what the provocation.\r\n\r\nLil smoothed my remarks over, and fielded a dozen more, and it looked\r\nlike the objections would continue all afternoon and all night and all\r\nthe next day, and I felt woozy and overwrought and miserable all at the\r\nsame time, staring at Lil and her harried smile and her nervous\r\nsmoothing of her hair over her ears.\r\n\r\nFinally, she called the question. By tradition, the votes were collected\r\nin secret and publicly tabulated over the data-channels. The group's\r\neyes unfocussed as they called up HUDs and watched the totals as they\r\nrolled in. I was offline and unable to vote or watch.\r\n\r\nAt length, Lil heaved a relieved sigh and smiled, dropping her hands\r\nbehind her back.\r\n\r\n\"All right then,\" she said, over the crowd's buzz. \"Let's get to work.\"\r\n\r\nI stood up, saw Dan and Lil staring into each other's eyes, a meaningful\r\nglance between new lovers, and I saw red. Literally. My vision washed\r\nover pink, and a strobe pounded at the edges of my vision. I took two\r\nlumbering steps towards them and opened my mouth to say something\r\nhorrible, and what came out was \"Waaagh.\" My right side went numb and my\r\nleg slipped out from under me and I crashed to the floor.\r\n\r\nThe slatted light from the shutters cast its way across my chest as I\r\ntried to struggle up with my left arm, and then it all went black.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI wasn't nuts after all.\r\n\r\nThe doctor's office in the Main Street infirmary was clean and white and\r\ndecorated with posters of Jiminy Cricket in doctors' whites with an\r\noutsized stethoscope. I came to on a hard pallet under a sign that\r\nreminded me to get a check-up twice a year, by gum! and I tried to bring\r\nmy hands up to shield my eyes from the over bright light and the over-\r\ncheerful signage, and discovered that I couldn't move my arms. Further\r\ninvestigation revealed that this was because I was strapped down, in\r\nfull-on four-point restraint.\r\n\r\n\"Waaagh,\" I said again.\r\n\r\nDan's worried face swam into my field of vision, along with a serious-\r\nlooking doctor, apparent 70, with a Norman Rockwell face full of\r\ncrow'sfeet and smile-lines.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome back, Julius. I'm Doctor Pete,\" the doctor said, in a kindly\r\nvoice that matched the face. Despite my recent disillusion with\r\ncastmember bullshit, I found his schtick comforting.\r\n\r\nI slumped back against the palette while the doc shone lights in my eyes\r\nand consulted various diagnostic apparati. I bore it in stoic silence,\r\ntoo confounded by the horrible Waaagh sounds to attempt more speech. The\r\ndoc would tell me what was going on when he was ready.\r\n\r\n\"Does he need to be tied up still?\" Dan asked, and I shook my head\r\nurgently. Being tied up wasn't my idea of a good time.\r\n\r\nThe doc smiled kindly. \"I think it's for the best, for now. Don't worry,\r\nJulius, we'll have you up and about soon enough.\"\r\n\r\nDan protested, but stopped when the doc threatened to send him out of\r\nthe room. He took my hand instead.\r\n\r\nMy nose itched. I tried to ignore it, but it got worse and worse, until\r\nit was all I could think of, the flaming lance of itch that strobed at\r\nthe tip of my nostril. Furiously, I wrinkled my face, rattled at my\r\nrestraints. The doc absentmindedly noticed my gyrations and delicately\r\nscratched my nose with a gloved finger. The relief was fantastic. I just\r\nhoped my nuts didn't start itching anytime soon.\r\n\r\nFinally, the doctor pulled up a chair and did something that caused the\r\nhead of the bed to raise up so that I could look him in the eye.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now,\" he said, stroking his chin. \"Julius, you've got a problem.\r\nYour friend here tells me your systems have been offline for more than a\r\nmonth. It sure would've been better if you'd come in to see me when it\r\nstarted up.\r\n\r\n\"But you didn't, and things got worse.\" He nodded up at Jiminy Cricket's\r\nrecriminations: Go ahead, see your doc! \"It's good advice, son, but\r\nwhat's done is done. You were restored from a backup about eight weeks\r\nago, I see. Without more tests, I can't be sure, but my theory is that\r\nthe brain-machine interface they installed at that time had a material\r\ndefect. It's been deteriorating ever since, misfiring and rebooting. The\r\nshut-downs are a protective mechanism, meant to keep it from introducing\r\nthe kind of seizure you experienced this afternoon. When the interface\r\nsenses malfunction, it shuts itself down and boots a diagnostic mode,\r\nattempts to fix itself and come back online.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that's fine for minor problems, but in cases like this, it's bad\r\nnews. The interface has been deteriorating steadily, and it's only a\r\nmatter of time before it does some serious damage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Waaagh?\" I asked. I meant to say, _All right, but what's wrong with my\r\nmouth?_\r\n\r\nThe doc put a finger to my lips. \"Don't try. The interface has locked\r\nup, and it's taken some of your voluntary nervous processes with it. In\r\ntime, it'll probably shut down, but for now, there's no point. That's\r\nwhy we've got you strapped down -- you were thrashing pretty hard when\r\nthey brought you in, and we didn't want you to hurt yourself.\"\r\n\r\n_Probably shut down_? Jesus. I could end up stuck like this forever. I\r\nstarted shaking.\r\n\r\nThe doc soothed me, stroking my hand, and in the process pressed a\r\ntransdermal on my wrist. The panic receded as the transdermal's sedative\r\noozed into my bloodstream.\r\n\r\n\"There, there,\" he said. \"It's nothing permanent. We can grow you a new\r\nclone and refresh it from your last backup. Unfortunately, that backup\r\nis a few months old. If we'd caught it earlier, we may've been able to\r\nsalvage a current backup, but given the deterioration you've displayed\r\nto date. . . Well, there just wouldn't be any point.\"\r\n\r\nMy heart hammered. I was going to lose two months -- lose it all, never\r\nhappened. My assassination, the new Hall of Presidents and my shameful\r\nattempt thereon, the fights with Lil, Lil and Dan, the meeting. My plans\r\nfor the rehab! All of it, good and bad, every moment flensed away.\r\n\r\nI couldn't do it. I had a rehab to finish, and I was the only one who\r\nunderstood how it had to be done. Without my relentless prodding, the\r\nad-hocs would surely revert to their old, safe ways. They might even\r\nleave it half-done, halt the process for an interminable review, present\r\na soft belly for Debra to savage.\r\n\r\nI wouldn't be restoring from backup.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI had two more seizures before the interface finally gave up and shut\r\nitself down. I remember the first, a confusion of vision-occluding\r\nstrobes and uncontrollable thrashing and the taste of copper, but the\r\nsecond happened without waking me from deep unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to again in the infirmary, Dan was still there. He had a\r\nday's growth of beard and new worrylines at the corners of his newly\r\nrejuvenated eyes. The doctor came in, shaking his head.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, it seems like the worst is over. I've drawn up the consent\r\nforms for the refresh and the new clone will be ready in an hour or two.\r\nIn the meantime, I think heavy sedation is in order. Once the restore's\r\nbeen completed, we'll retire this body for you and we'll be all finished\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\nRetire this body? Kill me, is what it meant.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said. I thrilled in my restraints: my voice was back under my\r\ncontrol!\r\n\r\n\"Oh, really now.\" The doc lost his bedside manner, let his exasperation\r\nslip through. \"There's nothing else for it. If you'd come to me when it\r\nall started, well, we might've had other options. You've got no one to\r\nblame but yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I repeated. \"Not now. I won't sign.\"\r\n\r\nDan put his hand on mine. I tried to jerk out from under it, but the\r\nrestraints and his grip held me fast. \"You've got to do it, Julius. It's\r\nfor the best,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to let you kill me,\" I said, through clenched teeth. His\r\nfingertips were callused, worked rough with exertion well beyond the\r\nnormal call of duty.\r\n\r\n\"No one's killing you, son,\" the doctor said. Son, son, son. Who knew\r\nhow old he was? He could be 18 for all I knew. \"It's just the opposite:\r\nwe're saving you. If you continue like this, it will only get worse. The\r\nseizures, mental breakdown, the whole melon going soft. You don't want\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\nI thought of Zed's spectacular transformation into a crazy person. _No,\r\nI sure don't_. \"I don't care about the interface. Chop it out. I can't\r\ndo it now.\" I swallowed. \"Later. After the rehab. Eight more weeks.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe irony! Once the doc knew I was serious, he sent Dan out of the room\r\nand rolled his eyes up while he placed a call. I saw his gorge work as\r\nhe subvocalized. He left me bound to the table, to wait.\r\n\r\nNo clocks in the infirmary, and no internal clock, and it may have been\r\nten minutes or five hours. I was catheterized, but I didn't know it\r\nuntil urgent necessity made the discovery for me.\r\n\r\nWhen the doc came back, he held a small device that I instantly\r\nrecognized: a HERF gun.\r\n\r\nOh, it wasn't the same model I'd used on the Hall of Presidents. This\r\none was smaller, and better made, with the precise engineering of a\r\nsurgical tool. The doc raised his eyebrows at me. \"You know what this\r\nis,\" he said, flatly. A dim corner of my mind gibbered, _he knows, he\r\nknows, the Hall of Presidents_. But he didn't know. That episode was\r\nlocked in my mind, invulnerable to backup.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"This one is high-powered in the extreme. It will penetrate the\r\ninterface's shielding and fuse it. It probably won't turn you into a\r\nvegetable. That's the best I can do. If this fails, we will restore you\r\nfrom your last backup. You have to sign the consent before I use it.\"\r\nHe'd dropped all kindly pretense from his voice, not bothering to\r\ndisguise his disgust. I was pitching out the miracle of the Bitchun\r\nSociety, the thing that had all but obsoleted the medical profession:\r\nwhy bother with surgery when you can grow a clone, take a backup, and\r\nrefresh the new body? Some people swapped corpuses just to get rid of a\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nI signed. The doc wheeled my gurney into the crash and hum of the\r\nutilidors and then put it on a freight tram that ran to the Imagineering\r\ncompound, and thence to a heavy, exposed Faraday cage. Of course: using\r\nthe HERF on me would kill any electronics in the neighborhood. They had\r\nto shield me before they pulled the trigger.\r\n\r\nThe doc placed the gun on my chest and loosened my restraints. He sealed\r\nthe cage and retreated to the lab's door. He pulled a heavy apron and\r\nhelmet with faceguard from a hook beside the door.\r\n\r\n\"Once I am outside the door, point it at your head and pull the trigger.\r\nI'll come back in five minutes. Once I am in the room, place the gun on\r\nthe floor and do not touch it. It is only good for a single usage, but I\r\nhave no desire to find out I'm wrong.\"\r\n\r\nHe closed the door. I took the pistol in my hand. It was heavy, dense\r\nwith its stored energy, the tip a parabolic hollow to better focus its\r\ncone.\r\n\r\nI lifted the gun to my temple and let it rest there. My thumb found the\r\ntrigger-stud.\r\n\r\nI paused. This wouldn't kill me, but it might lock the interface\r\nforever, paralyzing me, turning me into a thrashing maniac. I knew that\r\nI would never be able to pull the trigger. The doc must've known, too --\r\nthis was his way of convincing me to let him do that restore.\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth to call the doc, and what came out was \"Waaagh!\"\r\n\r\nThe seizure started. My arm jerked and my thumb nailed the stud, and\r\nthere was an ozone tang. The seizure stopped.\r\n\r\nI had no more interface.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe doc looked sour and pinched when he saw me sitting up on the gurney,\r\nrubbing at my biceps. He produced a handheld diagnostic tool and pointed\r\nit at my melon, then pronounced every bit of digital microcircuitry in\r\nit dead. For the first time since my twenties, I was no more advanced\r\nthan nature had made me.\r\n\r\nThe restraints left purple bruises at my wrists and ankles, where I'd\r\nthrashed against them. I hobbled out of the Faraday cage and the lab\r\nunder my own power, but just barely, my muscles groaning from the\r\ninadvertent isometric exercises of my seizure.\r\n\r\nDan was waiting in the utilidor, crouched and dozing against the wall.\r\nThe doc shook him awake and his head snapped up, his hand catching the\r\ndoc's in a lightning-quick reflex. It was easy to forget Dan's old line\r\nof work here in the Magic Kingdom, but when he smoothly snagged the\r\ndoc's arm and sprang to his feet, eyes hard and alert, I remembered. My\r\nold pal, the action hero.\r\n\r\nQuickly, Dan released the doc and apologized. He assessed my physical\r\nstate and wordlessly wedged his shoulder in my armpit, supporting me. I\r\ndidn't have the strength to stop him. I needed sleep.\r\n\r\n\"I'm taking you home,\" he said. \"We'll fight Debra off tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" I said, and boarded the waiting tram.\r\n\r\nBut we didn't go home. Dan took me back to my hotel, the Contemporary,\r\nand brought me up to my door. He keycarded the lock and stood awkwardly\r\nas I hobbled into the empty room that was my new home, as I collapsed\r\ninto the bed that was mine now.\r\n\r\nWith an apologetic look, he slunk away, back to Lil and the house we'd\r\nshared.\r\n\r\nI slapped on a sedative transdermal that the doc had given me, and added\r\na mood-equalizer that he'd recommended to control my \"personality\r\nswings.\" In seconds, I was asleep.\r\n\r\n========= CHAPTER 7 =========\r\n\r\nThe meds helped me cope with the next couple of days, starting the rehab\r\non the Mansion. We worked all night erecting a scaffolding around the\r\nfacade, though no real work would be done on it -- we wanted the\r\nappearance of rapid progress, and besides, I had an idea.\r\n\r\nI worked alongside Dan, using him as a personal secretary, handling my\r\ncalls, looking up plans, monitoring the Net for the first grumblings as\r\nthe Disney-going public realized that the Mansion was being taken down\r\nfor a full-blown rehab. We didn't exchange any unnecessary words,\r\nstanding side by side without ever looking into one another's eyes. I\r\ncouldn't really feel awkward around Dan, anyway. He never let me, and\r\nbesides we had our hands full directing disappointed guests away from\r\nthe Mansion. A depressing number of them headed straight for the Hall of\r\nPresidents.\r\n\r\nWe didn't have to wait long for the first panicked screed about the\r\nMansion to appear. Dan read it aloud off his HUD: \"Hey! Anyone hear\r\nanything about scheduled maintenance at the HM? I just buzzed by on the\r\nway to the new H of P's and it looks like some big stuff's afoot --\r\nscaffolding, castmembers swarming in and out, see the pic. I hope\r\nthey're not screwing up a good thing. BTW, don't miss the new H of P's\r\n-- very Bitchun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right,\" I said. \"Who's the author, and is he on the list?\"\r\n\r\nDan cogitated a moment. \"_She_ is Kim Wright, and she's on the list.\r\nGood Whuffie, lots of Mansion fanac, big readership.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call her,\" I said.\r\n\r\nThis was the plan: recruit rabid fans right away, get 'em in costume,\r\nand put 'em up on the scaffolds. Give them outsized, bat-adorned tools\r\nand get them to play at construction activity in thumpy, undead\r\npantomime. In time, Suneep and his gang would have a batch of\r\ntelepresence robots up and running, and we'd move to them, get them\r\nwandering the queue area, interacting with curious guests. The new\r\nMansion would be open for business in 48 hours, albeit in stripped-down\r\nfashion. The scaffolding made for a nice weenie, a visual draw that\r\nwould pull the hordes that thronged Debra's Hall of Presidents over for\r\na curious peek or two. Buzz city.\r\n\r\nI'm a pretty smart guy.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDan paged this Kim person and spoke to her as she was debarking the\r\nPirates of the Caribbean. I wondered if she was the right person for the\r\njob: she seemed awfully enamored of the rehabs that Debra and her crew\r\nhad performed. If I'd had more time, I would've run a deep background\r\ncheck on every one of the names on my list, but that would've taken\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nDan made some small talk with Kim, speaking aloud in deference to my\r\nhandicap, before coming to the point. \"We read your post about the\r\nMansion's rehab. You're the first one to notice it, and we wondered if\r\nyou'd be interested in coming by to find out a little more about our\r\nplans.\"\r\n\r\nDan winced. \"She's a screamer,\" he whispered.\r\n\r\nReflexively, I tried to pull up a HUD with my files on the Mansion fans\r\nwe hoped to recruit. Of course, nothing happened. I'd done that a dozen\r\ntimes that morning, and there was no end in sight. I couldn't seem to\r\nget lathered up about it, though, nor about anything else, not even the\r\nhickey just visible under Dan's collar. The transdermal mood-balancer on\r\nmy bicep was seeing to that -- doctor's orders.\r\n\r\n\"Fine, fine. We're standing by the Pet Cemetery, two cast members, male,\r\nin Mansion costumes. About five-ten, apparent 30. You can't miss us.\"\r\n\r\nShe didn't. She arrived out of breath and excited, jogging. She was\r\napparent 20, and dressed like a real 20 year old, in a hipster climate-\r\ncontrol cowl that clung to and released her limbs, which were long and\r\ndouble-kneed. All the rage among the younger set, including the girl\r\nwho'd shot me.\r\n\r\nBut the resemblance to my killer ended with her dress and body. She\r\nwasn't wearing a designer face, rather one that had enough imperfections\r\nto be the one she was born with, eyes set close and nose wide and\r\nslightly squashed.\r\n\r\nI admired the way she moved through the crowd, fast and low but without\r\njostling anyone. \"Kim,\" I called as she drew near. \"Over here.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave a happy shriek and made a beeline for us. Even charging full-\r\nbore, she was good enough at navigating the crowd that she didn't brush\r\nagainst a single soul. When she reached us, she came up short and\r\nbounced a little. \"Hi, I'm Kim!\" she said, pumping my arm with the\r\npeculiar violence of the extra-jointed. \"Julius,\" I said, then waited\r\nwhile she repeated the process with Dan.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" she said, \"what's the deal?\"\r\n\r\nI took her hand. \"Kim, we've got a job for you, if you're interested.\"\r\n\r\nShe squeezed my hand hard and her eyes shone. \"I'll take it!\" she said.\r\n\r\nI laughed, and so did Dan. It was a polite, castmembery sort of laugh,\r\nbut underneath it was relief. \"I think I'd better explain it to you\r\nfirst,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Explain away!\" she said, and gave my hand another squeeze.\r\n\r\nI let go of her hand and ran down an abbreviated version of the rehab\r\nplans, leaving out anything about Debra and her ad-hocs. Kim drank it\r\nall in greedily. She cocked her head at me as I ran it down, eyes wide.\r\nIt was disconcerting, and I finally asked, \"Are you recording this?\"\r\n\r\nKim blushed. \"I hope that's okay! I'm starting a new Mansion scrapbook.\r\nI have one for every ride in the Park, but this one's gonna be a world-\r\nbeater!\"\r\n\r\nHere was something I hadn't thought about. Publishing ad-hoc business\r\nwas tabu inside Park, so much so that it hadn't occurred to me that the\r\nnew castmembers we brought in would want to record every little detail\r\nand push it out over the Net as a big old Whuffie collector.\r\n\r\n\"I can switch it off,\" Kim said. She looked worried, and I really\r\nstarted to grasp how important the Mansion was to the people we were\r\nrecruiting, how much of a privilege we were offering them.\r\n\r\n\"Leave it rolling,\" I said. \"Let's show the world how it's done.\"\r\n\r\nWe led Kim into a utilidor and down to costuming. She was half-naked by\r\nthe time we got there, literally tearing off her clothes in anticipation\r\nof getting into character. Sonya, a Liberty Square ad-hoc that we'd\r\nstashed at costuming, already had clothes waiting for her, a rotting\r\nmaid's uniform with an oversized toolbelt.\r\n\r\nWe left Kim on the scaffolding, energetically troweling a water-based\r\ncement substitute onto the wall, scraping it off and moving to a new\r\nspot. It looked boring to me, but I could believe that we'd have to tear\r\nher away when the time came.\r\n\r\nWe went back to trawling the Net for the next candidate.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nBy lunchtime, there were ten drilling, hammering, troweling new\r\ncastmembers around the scaffolding, pushing black wheelbarrows, singing\r\n\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\" and generally having a high old time.\r\n\r\n\"This'll do,\" I said to Dan. I was exhausted and soaked with sweat, and\r\nthe transdermal under my costume itched. Despite the happy-juice in my\r\nbloodstream, a streak of uncastmemberly crankiness was shot through my\r\nmood. I needed to get offstage.\r\n\r\nDan helped me hobble away, and as we hit the utilidor, he whispered in\r\nmy ear, \"This was a great idea, Julius. Really.\"\r\n\r\nWe jumped a tram over to Imagineering, my chest swollen with pride.\r\nSuneep had three of his assistants working on the first generation of\r\nmobile telepresence robots for the exterior, and had promised a\r\nprototype for that afternoon. The robots were easy enough -- just off-\r\nthe-shelf stuff, really -- but the costumes and kinematics routines were\r\nsomething else. Thinking about what he and Suneep's gang of\r\nhypercreative super-geniuses would come up with cheered me up a little,\r\nas did being out of the public eye.\r\n\r\nSuneep's lab looked like it had been hit by a tornado. Imagineer packs\r\nrolled in and out with arcane gizmos, or formed tight argumentative\r\nknots in the corners as they shouted over whatever their HUDs were\r\ndisplaying. In the middle of it all was Suneep, who looked like he was\r\nbarely restraining an urge to shout Yippee! He was clearly in his\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nHe threw his arms open when he caught sight of Dan and me, threw them\r\nwide enough to embrace the whole mad, gibbering chaos. \"What wonderful\r\nflumgubbery!\" he shouted, over the noise.\r\n\r\n\"Sure is,\" I agreed. \"How's the prototype coming?\"\r\n\r\nSuneep waved absently, his short fingers describing trivialities in the\r\nair. \"In due time, in due time. I've put that team onto something else,\r\na kinematics routine for a class of flying spooks that use gasbags to\r\nstay aloft -- silent and scary. It's old spy-tech, and the retrofit's\r\ncoming tremendously. Take a look!\" He pointed a finger at me and,\r\npresumably, squirted some data my way.\r\n\r\n\"I'm offline,\" I reminded him gently.\r\n\r\nHe slapped his forehead, took a moment to push his hair off his face,\r\nand gave me an apologetic wave. \"Of course, of course. Here.\" He\r\nunrolled an LCD and handed it to me. A flock of spooks danced on the\r\nscreen, rendered against the ballroom scene. They were thematically\r\nconsistent with the existing Mansion ghosts, more funny than scary, and\r\ntheir faces were familiar. I looked around the lab and realized that\r\nthey'd caricatured various Imagineers.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! You noticed,\" Suneep said, rubbing his hands together. \"A very good\r\njoke, yes?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is terrific,\" I said, carefully. \"But I really need some robots up\r\nand running by tomorrow night, Suneep. We discussed this, remember?\"\r\nWithout telepresence robots, my recruiting would be limited to fans like\r\nKim, who lived in the area. I had broader designs than that.\r\n\r\nSuneep looked disappointed. \"Of course. We discussed it. I don't like to\r\nstop my people when they have good ideas, but there's a time and a\r\nplace. I'll put them on it right away. Leave it to me.\"\r\n\r\nDan turned to greet someone, and I looked to see who it was. Lil. Of\r\ncourse. She was raccoon-eyed with fatigue, and she reached out for Dan's\r\nhand, saw me, and changed her mind.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, guys,\" she said, with studied casualness.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, hello!\" said Suneep. He fired his finger at her -- the flying\r\nghosts, I imagined. Lil's eyes rolled up for a moment, then she nodded\r\nexhaustedly at him.\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" she said. \"I just heard from Lisa. She says the indoor\r\ncrews are on-schedule. They've got most of the animatronics dismantled,\r\nand they're taking down the glass in the Ballroom now.\" The Ballroom\r\nghost effects were accomplished by means of a giant pane of polished\r\nglass that laterally bisected the room. The Mansion had been built\r\naround it -- it was too big to take out in one piece. \"They say it'll be\r\na couple days before they've got it cut up and ready to remove.\"\r\n\r\nA pocket of uncomfortable silence descended on us, the roar of the\r\nImagineers rushing in to fill it.\r\n\r\n\"You must be exhausted,\" Dan said, at length.\r\n\r\n\"Goddamn right,\" I said, at the same moment that Lil said, \"I guess I\r\nam.\"\r\n\r\nWe both smiled wanly. Suneep put his arms around Lil's and my shoulders\r\nand squeezed. He smelled of an exotic cocktail of industrial lubricant,\r\nozone, and fatigue poisons.\r\n\r\n\"You two should go home and give each other a massage,\" he said. \"You've\r\nearned some rest.\"\r\n\r\nDan met my eye and shook his head apologetically. I squirmed out from\r\nunder Suneep's arm and thanked him quietly, then slunk off to the\r\nContemporary for a hot tub and a couple hours of sleep.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI came back to the Mansion at sundown. It was cool enough that I took a\r\nsurface route, costume rolled in a shoulderbag, instead of riding\r\nthrough the clattering, air-conditioned comfort of the utilidors.\r\n\r\nAs a freshening breeze blew across me, I suddenly had a craving for\r\n_real_ weather, the kind of climate I'd grown up with in Toronto. It was\r\nOctober, for chrissakes, and a lifetime of conditioning told me that it\r\nwas May. I stopped and leaned on a bench for a moment and closed my\r\neyes. Unbidden, and with the clarity of a HUD, I saw High Park in\r\nToronto, clothed in its autumn colors, fiery reds and oranges, shades of\r\nevergreen and earthy brown. God, I needed a vacation.\r\n\r\nI opened my eyes and realized that I was standing in front of the Hall\r\nof Presidents, and that there was a queue ahead of me for it, one that\r\nstretched back and back. I did a quick sum in my head and sucked air\r\nbetween my teeth: they had enough people for five or six full houses\r\nwaiting here -- easily an hour's wait. The Hall _never_ drew crowds like\r\nthis. Debra was working the turnstiles in Betsy Ross gingham, and she\r\ncaught my eye and snapped a nod at me.\r\n\r\nI stalked off to the Mansion. A choir of zombie-shambling new recruits\r\nhad formed up in front of the gate, and were groaning their way through\r\n\"Grim Grinning Ghosts,\" with a new call-and-response structure. A small\r\naudience participated, urged on by the recruits on the scaffolding.\r\n\r\n\"Well, at least that's going right,\" I muttered to myself. And it was,\r\nexcept that I could see members of the ad-hoc looking on from the\r\nsidelines, and the looks weren't kindly. Totally obsessive fans are a\r\ngood measure of a ride's popularity, but they're kind of a pain in the\r\nass, too. They lipsynch the soundtrack, cadge souvenirs and pester you\r\nwith smarmy, show-off questions. After a while, even the cheeriest\r\ncastmember starts to lose patience, develop an automatic distaste for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Square ad-hocs who were working on the Mansion had been\r\nrailroaded into approving a rehab, press-ganged into working on it, and\r\nwere now forced to endure the company of these grandstanding megafans.\r\nIf I'd been there when it all started -- instead of sleeping! -- I\r\nmay've been able to massage their bruised egos, but now I wondered if it\r\nwas too late.\r\n\r\nNothing for it but to do it. I ducked into a utilidor, changed into my\r\ncostume and went back onstage. I joined the call-and-response\r\nenthusiastically, walking around to the ad-hocs and getting them to join\r\nin, reluctantly or otherwise.\r\n\r\nBy the time the choir retired, sweaty and exhausted, a group of ad-hocs\r\nwere ready to take their place, and I escorted my recruits to an\r\noffstage break-room.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSuneep didn't deliver the robot prototypes for a week, and told me that\r\nit would be another week before I could have even five production units.\r\nThough he didn't say it, I got the sense that his guys were out of\r\ncontrol, so excited by the freedom from ad-hoc oversight that they were\r\nrunning wild. Suneep himself was nearly a wreck, nervous and jumpy. I\r\ndidn't press it.\r\n\r\nBesides, I had problems of my own. The new recruits were multiplying. I\r\nwas staying on top of the fan response to the rehab from a terminal I'd\r\nhad installed in my hotel room. Kim and her local colleagues were\r\nfielding millions of hits every day, their Whuffie accumulating as\r\nenvious fans around the world logged in to watch their progress on the\r\nscaffolding.\r\n\r\nThat was all according to plan. What wasn't according to plan was that\r\nthe new recruits were doing their own recruiting, extending invitations\r\nto their net-pals to come on down to Florida, bunk on their sofas and\r\nguest-beds, and present themselves to me for active duty.\r\n\r\nThe tenth time it happened, I approached Kim in the break-room. Her\r\ngorge was working, her eyes tracked invisible words across the middle\r\ndistance. No doubt she was penning yet another breathless missive about\r\nthe magic of working in the Mansion. \"Hey, there,\" I said. \"Have you got\r\na minute to meet with me?\"\r\n\r\nShe held up a single finger, then, a moment later, gave me a bright\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Julius!\" she said. \"Sure!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you change into civvies, we'll take a walk through the Park\r\nand talk?\"\r\n\r\nKim wore her costume every chance she got. I'd been quite firm about her\r\nturning it in to the laundry every night instead of wearing it home.\r\n\r\nReluctantly, she stepped into a change-room and switched into her cowl.\r\nWe took the utilidor to the Fantasyland exit and walked through the\r\nlate-afternoon rush of children and their adults, queued deep and thick\r\nfor Snow White, Dumbo and Peter Pan.\r\n\r\n\"How're you liking it here?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nKim gave a little bounce. \"Oh, Julius, it's the best time of my life,\r\nreally! A dream come true. I'm meeting so many interesting people, and\r\nI'm really feeling creative. I can't wait to try out the telepresence\r\nrigs, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm really pleased with what you and your friends are up to here.\r\nYou're working hard, putting on a good show. I like the songs you've\r\nbeen working up, too.\"\r\n\r\nShe did one of those double-kneed shuffles that was the basis of any\r\nnumber of action vids those days and she was suddenly standing in front\r\nof me, hand on my shoulder, looking into my eyes. She looked serious.\r\n\r\n\"Is there a problem, Julius? If there is, I'd rather we just talked\r\nabout it, instead of making chitchat.\"\r\n\r\nI smiled and took her hand off my shoulder. \"How old are you, Kim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nineteen,\" she said. \"What's the problem?\"\r\n\r\nNineteen! Jesus, no wonder she was so volatile. _What's my excuse,\r\nthen?_\r\n\r\n\"It's not a problem, Kim, it's just something I wanted to discuss with\r\nyou. The people you-all have been bringing down to work for me, they're\r\nall really great castmembers.\"\r\n\r\n\"But?\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have limited resources around here. Not enough hours in the day\r\nfor me to stay on top of the new folks, the rehab, everything. Not to\r\nmention that until we open the new Mansion, there's a limited number of\r\nextras we can use out front. I'm concerned that we're going to put\r\nsomeone on stage without proper training, or that we're going to run out\r\nof uniforms; I'm also concerned about people coming all the way here and\r\ndiscovering that there aren't any shifts for them to take.\"\r\n\r\nShe gave me a relieved look. \"Is _that_ all? Don't worry about it. I've\r\nbeen talking to Debra, over at the Hall of Presidents, and she says she\r\ncan pick up any people who can't be used at the Mansion -- we could even\r\nrotate back and forth!\" She was clearly proud of her foresight.\r\n\r\nMy ears buzzed. Debra, one step ahead of me all along the way. She\r\nprobably suggested that Kim do some extra recruiting in the first place.\r\nShe'd take in the people who came down to work the Mansion, convince\r\nthem they'd been hard done by the Liberty Square crew, and rope them\r\ninto her little Whuffie ranch, the better to seize the Mansion, the\r\nPark, the whole of Walt Disney World.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't think it'll come to that,\" I said, carefully. \"I'm sure we\r\ncan find a use for them all at the Mansion. More the merrier.\"\r\n\r\nKim cocked quizzical, but let it go. I bit my tongue. The pain brought\r\nme back to reality, and I started planning costume production, training\r\nrosters, bunking. God, if only Suneep would finish the robots!\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, 'no'?\" I said, hotly.\r\n\r\nLil folded her arms and glared. \"No, Julius. It won't fly. The group is\r\nalready upset that all the glory is going to the new people, they'll\r\nnever let us bring more in. They also won't stop working on the rehab to\r\ntrain them, costume them, feed them and mother them. They're losing\r\nWhuffie every day that the Mansion's shut up, and they don't want any\r\nmore delays. Dave's already joined up with Debra, and I'm sure he's not\r\nthe last one.\"\r\n\r\nDave -- the jerk who'd pissed all over the rehab in the meeting. Of\r\ncourse he'd gone over. Lil and Dan stood side by side on the porch of\r\nthe house where I'd lived. I'd driven out that night to convince Lil to\r\nsell the ad-hocs on bringing in more recruits, but it wasn't going\r\naccording to plan. They wouldn't even let me in the house.\r\n\r\n\"So what do I tell Kim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell her whatever you want,\" Lil said. \"You brought her in -- you\r\nmanage her. Take some goddamn responsibility for once in your life.\"\r\n\r\nIt wasn't going to get any better. Dan gave me an apologetic look. Lil\r\nglared a moment longer, then went into the house.\r\n\r\n\"Debra's doing real well,\" he said. \"The net's all over her. Biggest\r\nthing ever. Flash-baking is taking off in nightclubs, dance mixes with\r\nthe DJ's backup being shoved in bursts into the dancers.\"\r\n\r\n\"God,\" I said. \"I fucked up, Dan. I fucked it all up.\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't say anything, and that was the same as agreeing.\r\n\r\nDriving back to the hotel, I decided I needed to talk to Kim. She was a\r\nproblem I didn't need, and maybe a problem I could solve. I pulled a\r\nscreeching U-turn and drove the little runabout to her place, a tiny\r\ncondo in a crumbling complex that had once been a gated seniors'\r\nvillage, pre-Bitchun.\r\n\r\nHer place was easy to spot. All the lights were burning, faint\r\nconversation audible through the screen door. I jogged up the steps two\r\nat a time, and was about to knock when a familiar voice drifted through\r\nthe screen.\r\n\r\nDebra, saying: \"Oh yes, oh yes! Terrific idea! I'd never really thought\r\nabout using streetmosphere players to liven up the queue area, but\r\nyou're making a lot of sense. You people have just been doing the _best_\r\nwork over at the Mansion -- find me more like you and I'll take them for\r\nthe Hall any day!\"\r\n\r\nI heard Kim and her young friends chatting excitedly, proudly. The anger\r\nand fear suffused me from tip to toe, and I felt suddenly light and cool\r\nand ready to do something terrible.\r\n\r\nI padded silently down the steps and got into my runabout.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nSome people never learn. I'm one of them, apparently.\r\n\r\nI almost chortled over the foolproof simplicity of my plan as I slipped\r\nin through the cast entrance using the ID card I'd scored when my\r\nsystems went offline and I was no longer able to squirt my authorization\r\nat the door.\r\n\r\nI changed clothes in a bathroom on Main Street, switching into a black\r\ncowl that completely obscured my features, then slunk through the\r\nshadows along the storefronts until I came to the moat around\r\nCinderella's castle. Keeping low, I stepped over the fence and duck-\r\nwalked down the embankment, then slipped into the water and sloshed\r\nacross to the Adventureland side.\r\n\r\nSlipping along to the Liberty Square gateway, I flattened myself in\r\ndoorways whenever I heard maintenance crews passing in the distance,\r\nuntil I reached the Hall of Presidents, and in a twinkling I was inside\r\nthe theater itself.\r\n\r\nHumming the Small World theme, I produced a short wrecking bar from my\r\ncowl's tabbed pocket and set to work.\r\n\r\nThe primary broadcast units were hidden behind a painted scrim over the\r\nstage, and they were surprisingly well built for a first generation\r\ntech. I really worked up a sweat smashing them, but I kept at it until\r\nnot a single component remained recognizable. The work was slow and loud\r\nin the silent Park, but it lulled me into a sleepy reverie, an\r\nautohypnotic swing-bang-swing-bang timeless time. To be on the safe\r\nside, I grabbed the storage units and slipped them into the cowl.\r\n\r\nLocating their backup units was a little trickier, but years of hanging\r\nout at the Hall of Presidents while Lil tinkered with the animatronics\r\nhelped me. I methodically investigated every nook, cranny and storage\r\narea until I located them, in what had been a break-room closet. By now,\r\nI had the rhythm of the thing, and I made short work of them.\r\n\r\nI did one more pass, wrecking anything that looked like it might be a\r\nprototype for the next generation or notes that would help them\r\nreconstruct the units I'd smashed.\r\n\r\nI had no illusions about Debra's preparedness -- she'd have something\r\noffsite that she could get up and running in a few days. I wasn't doing\r\nanything permanent, I was just buying myself a day or two.\r\n\r\nI made my way clean out of the Park without being spotted, and sloshed\r\nmy way into my runabout, shoes leaking water from the moat.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in weeks, I slept like a baby.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nOf course, I got caught. I don't really have the temperament for\r\nMachiavellian shenanigans, and I left a trail a mile wide, from the\r\nmuddy footprints in the Contemporary's lobby to the wrecking bar\r\nthoughtlessly left behind, with my cowl and the storage units from the\r\nHall, forgotten on the back seat of my runabout.\r\n\r\nI whistled my personal jazzy uptempo version of \"Grim Grinning Ghosts\"\r\nas I made my way from Costuming, through the utilidor, out to Liberty\r\nSquare, half an hour before the Park opened.\r\n\r\nStanding in front of me were Lil and Debra. Debra was holding my cowl\r\nand wrecking bar. Lil held the storage units.\r\n\r\nI hadn't put on my transdermals that morning, and so the emotion I felt\r\nwas unmuffled, loud and yammering.\r\n\r\nI ran.\r\n\r\nI ran past them, along the road to Adventureland, past the Tiki Room\r\nwhere I'd been killed, past the Adventureland gate where I'd waded\r\nthrough the moat, down Main Street. I ran and ran, elbowing early\r\nguests, trampling flowers, knocking over an apple cart across from the\r\nPenny Arcade.\r\n\r\nI ran until I reached the main gate, and turned, thinking I'd outrun Lil\r\nand Debra and all my problems. I'd thought wrong. They were both there,\r\na step behind me, puffing and red. Debra held my wrecking bar like a\r\nweapon, and she brandished it at me.\r\n\r\n\"You're a goddamn idiot, you know that?\" she said. I think if we'd been\r\nalone, she would've swung it at me.\r\n\r\n\"Can't take it when someone else plays rough, huh, Debra?\" I sneered.\r\n\r\nLil shook her head disgustedly. \"She's right, you are an idiot. The\r\nad-hoc's meeting in Adventureland. You're coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" I asked, feeling belligerent. \"You going to honor me for all my\r\nhard work?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're going to talk about the future, Julius, what's left of it for\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Lil, can't you see what's going on? They _killed_ me!\r\nThey did it, and now we're fighting each other instead of her! Why can't\r\nyou see how _wrong_ that is?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better watch those accusations, Julius,\" Debra said, quietly and\r\nintensely, almost hissing. \"I don't know who killed you or why, but\r\nyou're the one who's guilty here. You need help.\"\r\n\r\nI barked a humorless laugh. Guests were starting to stream into the\r\nnow-open Park, and several of them were watching intently as the three\r\ncostumed castmembers shouted at each other. I could feel my Whuffie\r\nhemorrhaging. \"Debra, you are purely full of shit, and your work is\r\ntrite and unimaginative. You're a fucking despoiler and you don't even\r\nhave the guts to admit it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's _enough_, Julius,\" Lil said, her face hard, her rage barely in\r\ncheck. \"We're going.\"\r\n\r\nDebra walked a pace behind me, Lil a pace before, all the way through\r\nthe crowd to Adventureland. I saw a dozen opportunities to slip into a\r\ngap in the human ebb and flow and escape custody, but I didn't try. I\r\nwanted a chance to tell the whole world what I'd done and why I'd done\r\nit.\r\n\r\nDebra followed us in when we mounted the steps to the meeting room. Lil\r\nturned. \"I don't think you should be here, Debra,\" she said in measured\r\ntones.\r\n\r\nDebra shook her head. \"You can't keep me out, you know. And you\r\nshouldn't want to. We're on the same side.\"\r\n\r\nI snorted derisively, and I think it decided Lil. \"Come on, then,\" she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nIt was SRO in the meeting room, packed to the gills with the entire\r\nad-hoc, except for my new recruits. No work was being done on the rehab,\r\nthen, and the Liberty Belle would be sitting at her dock. Even the\r\nrestaurant crews were there. Liberty Square must've been a ghost town.\r\nIt gave the meeting a sense of urgency: the knowledge that there were\r\nguests in Liberty Square wandering aimlessly, looking for castmembers to\r\nhelp them out. Of course, Debra's crew might've been around.\r\n\r\nThe crowd's faces were hard and bitter, leaving no doubt in my mind that\r\nI was in deep shit. Even Dan, sitting in the front row, looked angry. I\r\nnearly started crying right then. Dan -- oh, Dan. My pal, my confidant,\r\nmy patsy, my rival, my nemesis. Dan, Dan, Dan. I wanted to beat him to\r\ndeath and hug him at the same time.\r\n\r\nLil took the podium and tucked stray hairs behind her ears. \"All right,\r\nthen,\" she said. I stood to her left and Debra stood to her right.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for coming out today. I'd like to get this done quickly. We all\r\nhave important work to get to. I'll run down the facts: last night, a\r\nmember of this ad-hoc vandalized the Hall of Presidents, rendering it\r\nuseless. It's estimated that it will take at least a week to get it back\r\nup and running.\r\n\r\n\"I don't have to tell you that this isn't acceptable. This has never\r\nhappened before, and it will never happen again. We're going to see to\r\nthat.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to propose that no further work be done on the Mansion until\r\nthe Hall of Presidents is fully operational. I will be volunteering my\r\nservices on the repairs.\"\r\n\r\nThere were nods in the audience. Lil wouldn't be the only one working at\r\nthe Hall that week. \"Disney World isn't a competition,\" Lil said. \"All\r\nthe different ad-hocs work together, and we do it to make the Park as\r\ngood as we can. We lose sight of that at our peril.\"\r\n\r\nI nearly gagged on bile. \"I'd like to say something,\" I said, as calmly\r\nas I could manage.\r\n\r\nLil shot me a look. \"That's fine, Julius. Any member of the ad-hoc can\r\nspeak.\"\r\n\r\nI took a deep breath. \"I did it, all right?\" I said. My voice cracked.\r\n\"I did it, and I don't have any excuse for having done it. It may not\r\nhave been the smartest thing I've ever done, but I think you all should\r\nunderstand how I was driven to it.\r\n\r\n\"We're not _supposed_ to be in competition with one another here, but we\r\nall know that that's just a polite fiction. The truth is that there's\r\nreal competition in the Park, and that the hardest players are the crew\r\nthat rehabbed the Hall of Presidents. They _stole_ the Hall from you!\r\nThey did it while you were distracted, they used _me_ to engineer the\r\ndistraction, they _murdered_ me!\" I heard the shriek creeping into my\r\nvoice, but I couldn't do anything about it.\r\n\r\n\"Usually, the lie that we're all on the same side is fine. It lets us\r\nwork together in peace. But that changed the day they had me shot. If\r\nyou keep on believing it, you're going to lose the Mansion, the Liberty\r\nBelle, Tom Sawyer Island -- all of it. All the history we have with this\r\nplace -- all the history that the billions who've visited it have --\r\nit's going to be destroyed and replaced with the sterile, thoughtless\r\nshit that's taken over the Hall. Once that happens, there's nothing left\r\nthat makes this place special. Anyone can get the same experience\r\nsitting at home on the sofa! What happens then, huh? How much longer do\r\nyou think this place will stay open once the only people here are\r\n_you?_\"\r\n\r\nDebra smiled condescendingly. \"Are you finished, then?\" she asked,\r\nsweetly. \"Fine. I know I'm not a member of this group, but since it was\r\nmy work that was destroyed last night, I think I would like to address\r\nJulius's statements, if you don't mind.\" She paused, but no one spoke\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\"First of all, I want you all to know that we don't hold you responsible\r\nfor what happened last night. We know who was responsible, and he needs\r\nhelp. I urge you to see to it that he gets it.\r\n\r\n\"Next, I'd like to say that as far as I'm concerned, we are on the same\r\nside -- the side of the Park. This is a special place, and it couldn't\r\nexist without all of our contributions. What happened to Julius was\r\nterrible, and I sincerely hope that the person responsible is caught and\r\nbrought to justice. But that person wasn't me or any of the people in my\r\nad-hoc.\r\n\r\n\"Lil, I'd like to thank you for your generous offer of assistance, and\r\nwe'll take you up on it. That goes for all of you -- come on by the\r\nHall, we'll put you to work. We'll be up and running in no time.\r\n\r\n\"Now, as far as the Mansion goes, let me say this once and for all:\r\nneither me nor my ad-hoc have any desire to take over the operations of\r\nthe Mansion. It is a terrific attraction, and it's getting better with\r\nthe work you're all doing. If you've been worrying about it, then you\r\ncan stop worrying now. We're all on the same side.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for hearing me out. I've got to go see my team now.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned and left, a chorus of applause following her out.\r\n\r\nLil waited until it died down, then said, \"All right, then, we've got\r\nwork to do, too. I'd like to ask you all a favor, first. I'd like us to\r\nkeep the details of last night's incident to ourselves. Letting the\r\nguests and the world know about this ugly business isn't good for\r\nanyone. Can we all agree to do that?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment's pause while the results were tabulated on the HUDs,\r\nthen Lil gave them a million-dollar smile. \"I knew you'd come through.\r\nThanks, guys. Let's get to work.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI spent the day at the hotel, listlessly scrolling around on my\r\nterminal. Lil had made it very clear to me after the meeting that I\r\nwasn't to show my face inside the Park until I'd \"gotten help,\" whatever\r\nthat meant.\r\n\r\nBy noon, the news was out. It was hard to pin down the exact source, but\r\nit seemed to revolve around the new recruits. One of them had told their\r\nnet-pals about the high drama in Liberty Square, and mentioned my name.\r\n\r\nThere were already a couple of sites vilifying me, and I expected more.\r\nI needed some kind of help, that was for sure.\r\n\r\nI thought about leaving then, turning my back on the whole business and\r\nleaving Walt Disney World to start yet another new life, Whuffie-poor\r\nand fancy-free.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn't be so bad. I'd been in poor repute before, not so long ago.\r\nThat first time Dan and I had palled around, back at the U of T, I'd\r\nbeen the center of a lot of pretty ambivalent sentiment, and Whuffie-\r\npoor as a man can be.\r\n\r\nI slept in a little coffin on-campus, perfectly climate controlled. It\r\nwas cramped and dull, but my access to the network was free and I had\r\nplenty of material to entertain myself. While I couldn't get a table in\r\na restaurant, I was free to queue up at any of the makers around town\r\nand get myself whatever I wanted to eat and drink, whenever I wanted it.\r\nCompared to 99.99999 percent of all the people who'd ever lived, I had a\r\nlife of unparalleled luxury.\r\n\r\nEven by the standards of the Bitchun Society, I was hardly a rarity. The\r\nnumber of low-esteem individuals at large was significant, and they got\r\nalong just fine, hanging out in parks, arguing, reading, staging plays,\r\nplaying music.\r\n\r\nOf course, that wasn't the life for me. I had Dan to pal around with, a\r\nrare high-net-Whuffie individual who was willing to fraternize with a\r\nshmuck like me. He'd stand me to meals at sidewalk cafes and concerts at\r\nthe SkyDome, and shoot down any snotty reputation-punk who sneered at my\r\nWhuffie tally. Being with Dan was a process of constantly reevaluating\r\nmy beliefs in the Bitchun Society, and I'd never had a more vibrant,\r\nthought-provoking time in all my life.\r\n\r\nI could have left the Park, deadheaded to anywhere in the world, started\r\nover. I could have turned my back on Dan, on Debra, on Lil and the whole\r\nmess.\r\n\r\nI didn't.\r\n\r\nI called up the doc.\r\n\r\n========= CHAPTER 8 =========\r\n\r\nDoctor Pete answered on the third ring, audio-only. In the background, I\r\nheard a chorus of crying children, the constant backdrop of the Magic\r\nKingdom infirmary.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, doc,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Julius. What can I do for you?\" Under the veneer of professional\r\nmedical and castmember friendliness, I sensed irritation.\r\n\r\n_Make it all good again_. \"I'm not really sure. I wanted to see if I\r\ncould talk it over with you. I'm having some pretty big problems.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm on-shift until five. Can it wait until then?\"\r\n\r\nBy then, I had no idea if I'd have the nerve to see him. \"I don't think\r\nso -- I was hoping we could meet right away.\"\r\n\r\n\"If it's an emergency, I can have an ambulance sent for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's urgent, but not an emergency. I need to talk about it in person.\r\nPlease?\"\r\n\r\nHe sighed in undoctorly, uncastmemberly fashion. \"Julius, I've got\r\nimportant things to do here. Are you sure this can't wait?\"\r\n\r\nI bit back a sob. \"I'm sure, doc.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right then. When can you be here?\"\r\n\r\nLil had made it clear that she didn't want me in the Park. \"Can you meet\r\nme? I can't really come to you. I'm at the Contemporary, Tower B, room\r\n2334.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't really make house calls, son.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, I know.\" I hated how pathetic I sounded. \"Can you make an\r\nexception? I don't know who else to turn to.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll be there as soon as I can. I'll have to get someone to cover for\r\nme. Let's not make a habit of this, all right?\"\r\n\r\nI whooshed out my relief. \"I promise.\"\r\n\r\nHe disconnected abruptly, and I found myself dialing Dan.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" he said, cautiously.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Pete is coming over, Dan. I don't know if he can help me -- I\r\ndon't know if anyone can. I just wanted you to know.\"\r\n\r\nHe surprised me, then, and made me remember why he was still my friend,\r\neven after everything. \"Do you want me to come over?\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be very nice,\" I said, quietly. \"I'm at the hotel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me ten minutes,\" he said, and rang off.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nHe found me on my patio, looking out at the Castle and the peaks of\r\nSpace Mountain. To my left spread the sparkling waters of the Seven Seas\r\nLagoon, to my right, the Property stretched away for mile after\r\nmanicured mile. The sun was warm on my skin, faint strains of happy\r\nlaughter drifted with the wind, and the flowers were in bloom. In\r\nToronto, it would be freezing rain, gray buildings, noisome rapid\r\ntransit (a monorail hissed by), and hard-faced anonymity. I missed it.\r\n\r\nDan pulled up a chair next to mine and sat without a word. We both\r\nstared out at the view for a long while.\r\n\r\n\"It's something else, isn't it?\" I said, finally.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose so,\" he said. \"I want to say something before the doc comes\r\nby, Julius.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lil and I are through. It should never have happened in the first\r\nplace, and I'm not proud of myself. If you two were breaking up, that's\r\nnone of my business, but I had no right to hurry it along.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" I said. I was too drained for emotion.\r\n\r\n\"I've taken a room here, moved my things.\"\r\n\r\n\"How's Lil taking it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, she thinks I'm a total bastard. I suppose she's right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose she's partly right,\" I corrected him.\r\n\r\nHe gave me a gentle slug in the shoulder. \"Thanks.\"\r\n\r\nWe waited in companionable silence until the doc arrived.\r\n\r\nHe bustled in, his smile lines drawn up into a sour purse and waited\r\nexpectantly. I left Dan on the patio while I took a seat on the bed.\r\n\r\n\"I'm cracking up or something,\" I said. \"I've been acting erratically,\r\nsometimes violently. I don't know what's wrong with me.\" I'd rehearsed\r\nthe speech, but it still wasn't easy to choke out.\r\n\r\n\"We both know what's wrong, Julius,\" the doc said, impatiently. \"You\r\nneed to be refreshed from your backup, get set up with a fresh clone and\r\nretire this one. We've had this talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't do it,\" I said, not meeting his eye. \"I just can't -- isn't\r\nthere another way?\"\r\n\r\nThe doc shook his head. \"Julius, I've got limited resources to allocate.\r\nThere's a perfectly good cure for what's ailing you, and if you won't\r\ntake it, there's not much I can do for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what about meds?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your problem isn't a chemical imbalance, it's a mental defect. Your\r\n_brain_ is _broken_, son. All that meds will do is mask the symptoms,\r\nwhile you get worse. I can't tell you what you want to hear,\r\nunfortunately. Now, If you're ready to take the cure, I can retire this\r\nclone immediately and get you restored into a new one in 48 hours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't there another way? Please? You have to help me -- I can't lose\r\nall this.\" I couldn't admit my real reasons for being so attached to\r\nthis singularly miserable chapter in my life, not even to myself.\r\n\r\nThe doctor rose to go. \"Look, Julius, you haven't got the Whuffie to\r\nmake it worth anyone's time to research a solution to this problem,\r\nother than the one that we all know about. I can give you mood-\r\nsuppressants, but that's not a permanent solution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\nHe boggled. \"You _can't_ just take dope for the rest of your life, son.\r\nEventually, something will happen to this body -- I see from your file\r\nthat you're stroke-prone -- and you're going to get refreshed from your\r\nbackup. The longer you wait, the more traumatic it'll be. You're robbing\r\nfrom your future self for your selfish present.\"\r\n\r\nIt wasn't the first time the thought had crossed my mind. Every passing\r\nday made it harder to take the cure. To lie down and wake up friends\r\nwith Dan, to wake up and be in love with Lil again. To wake up to a\r\nMansion the way I remembered it, a Hall of Presidents where I could find\r\nLil bent over with her head in a President's guts of an afternoon. To\r\nlie down and wake without disgrace, without knowing that my lover and my\r\nbest friend would betray me, _had_ betrayed me.\r\n\r\nI just couldn't do it -- not yet, anyway.\r\n\r\nDan -- Dan was going to kill himself soon, and if I restored myself from\r\nmy old backup, I'd lose my last year with him. I'd lose _his_ last year.\r\n\r\n\"Let's table that, doc. I hear what you're saying, but there're\r\ncomplications. I guess I'll take the mood-suppressants for now.\"\r\n\r\nHe gave me a cold look. \"I'll give you a scrip, then. I could've done\r\nthat without coming out here. Please don't call me anymore.\"\r\n\r\nI was shocked by his obvious ire, but I didn't understand it until he\r\nwas gone and I told Dan what had happened.\r\n\r\n\"Us old-timers, we're used to thinking of doctors as highly trained\r\nprofessionals -- all that pre-Bitchun med-school stuff, long\r\ninternships, anatomy drills... Truth is, the average doc today gets more\r\ntraining in bedside manner than bioscience. 'Doctor' Pete is a\r\ntechnician, not an MD, not the way you and I mean it. Anyone with the\r\nkind of knowledge you're looking for is working as a historical\r\nresearcher, not a doctor.\r\n\r\n\"But that's not the illusion. The doc is supposed to be the authority on\r\nmedical matters, even though he's only got one trick: restore from\r\nbackup. You're reminding Pete of that, and he's not happy to have it\r\nhappen.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI waited a week before returning to the Magic Kingdom, sunning myself on\r\nthe white sand beach at the Contemporary, jogging the Walk Around the\r\nWorld, taking a canoe out to the wild and overgrown Discovery Island,\r\nand generally cooling out. Dan came by in the evenings and it was like\r\nold times, running down the pros and cons of Whuffie and Bitchunry and\r\nlife in general, sitting on my porch with a sweating pitcher of\r\nlemonade.\r\n\r\nOn the last night, he presented me with a clever little handheld, a\r\nmuseum piece that I recalled fondly from the dawning days of the Bitchun\r\nSociety. It had much of the functionality of my defunct systems, in a\r\npackage I could slip in my shirt pocket. It felt like part of a costume,\r\nlike the turnip watches the Ben Franklin streetmosphere players wore at\r\nthe American Adventure.\r\n\r\nMuseum piece or no, it meant that I was once again qualified to\r\nparticipate in the Bitchun Society, albeit more slowly and less\r\nefficiently than I once may've. I took it downstairs the next morning\r\nand drove to the Magic Kingdom's castmember lot.\r\n\r\nAt least, that was the plan. When I got down to the Contemporary's\r\nparking lot, my runabout was gone. A quick check with the handheld\r\nrevealed the worst: my Whuffie was low enough that someone had just\r\ngotten inside and driven away, realizing that they could make more\r\npopular use of it than I could.\r\n\r\nWith a sinking feeling, I trudged up to my room and swiped my key\r\nthrough the lock. It emitted a soft, unsatisfied _bzzz_ and lit up,\r\n\"Please see the front desk.\" My room had been reassigned, too. I had the\r\nshort end of the Whuffie stick.\r\n\r\nAt least there was no mandatory Whuffie check on the monorail platform,\r\nbut the other people on the car were none too friendly to me, and no one\r\noffered me an inch more personal space than was necessary. I had hit\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI took the castmember entrance to the Magic Kingdom, clipping my name\r\ntag to my Disney Operations polo shirt, ignoring the glares of my fellow\r\ncastmembers in the utilidors.\r\n\r\nI used the handheld to page Dan. \"Hey there,\" he said, brightly. I could\r\ntell instantly that I was being humored.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, up in the Square. By the Liberty Tree.\"\r\n\r\nIn front of the Hall of Presidents. I worked the handheld, pinged some\r\nWhuffie manually. Debra was spiked so high it seemed she'd never come\r\ndown, as were Tim and her whole crew in aggregate. They were drawing\r\nfrom guests by the millions, and from castmembers and from people who'd\r\nread the popular accounts of their struggle against the forces of petty\r\njealousy and sabotage -- i.e., me.\r\n\r\nI felt light-headed. I hurried along to costuming and changed into the\r\nheavy green Mansion costume, then ran up the stairs to the Square.\r\n\r\nI found Dan sipping a coffee and sitting on a bench under the giant,\r\nlantern-hung Liberty Tree. He had a second cup waiting for me, and\r\npatted the bench next to him. I sat with him and sipped, waiting for him\r\nto spill whatever bit of rotten news he had for me this morning -- I\r\ncould feel it hovering like storm clouds.\r\n\r\nHe wouldn't talk though, not until we finished the coffee. Then he stood\r\nand strolled over to the Mansion. It wasn't rope-drop yet, and there\r\nweren't any guests in the Park, which was all for the better, given what\r\nwas coming next.\r\n\r\n\"Have you taken a look at Debra's Whuffie lately?\" he asked, finally, as\r\nwe stood by the pet cemetery, considering the empty scaffolding.\r\n\r\nI started to pull out the handheld but he put a hand on my arm. \"Don't\r\nbother,\" he said, morosely. \"Suffice it to say, Debra's gang is number\r\none with a bullet. Ever since word got out about what happened to the\r\nHall, they've been stacking it deep. They can do just about anything,\r\nJules, and get away with it.\"\r\n\r\nMy stomach tightened and I found myself grinding my molars. \"So, what is\r\nit they've done, Dan?\" I asked, already knowing the answer.\r\n\r\nDan didn't have to respond, because at that moment, Tim emerged from the\r\nMansion, wearing a light cotton work-smock. He had a thoughtful\r\nexpression, and when he saw us, he beamed his elfin grin and came over.\r\n\r\n\"Hey guys!\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Hi, Tim,\" Dan said. I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty exciting stuff, huh?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I haven't told him yet,\" Dan said, with forced lightness. \"Why don't\r\nyou run it down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it's pretty radical, I have to admit. We've learned some stuff\r\nfrom the Hall that we wanted to apply, and at the same time, we wanted\r\nto capture some of the historical character of the ghost story.\"\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth to object, but Dan put a hand on my forearm. \"Really?\"\r\nhe asked innocently. \"How do you plan on doing that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we're keeping the telepresence robots -- that's a honey of an\r\nidea, Julius -- but we're giving each one an uplink so that it can\r\nflash-bake. We've got some high-Whuffie horror writers pulling together\r\na series of narratives about the lives of each ghost: how they met their\r\ntragic ends, what they've done since, you know.\r\n\r\n\"The way we've storyboarded it, the guests stream through the ride\r\npretty much the way they do now, walking through the preshow and then\r\ngetting into the ride-vehicles, the Doom Buggies. But here's the big\r\nchange: we _slow it all down_. We trade off throughput for intensity,\r\nmake it more of a premium product.\r\n\r\n\"So you're a guest. From the queue to the unload zone, you're being\r\nchased by these ghosts, these telepresence robots, and they're really\r\nscary -- I've got Suneep's concept artists going back to the drawing\r\nboard, hitting basic research on stuff that'll just scare the guests\r\nsilly. When a ghost catches you, lays its hands on you -- wham! Flash-\r\nbake! You get its whole grisly story in three seconds, across your\r\nfrontal lobe. By the time you've left, you've had ten or more ghost-\r\ncontacts, and the next time you come back, it's all new ghosts with all\r\nnew stories. The way that the Hall's drawing 'em, we're bound to be a\r\nhit.\" He put his hands behind his back and rocked on his heels, clearly\r\nproud of himself.\r\n\r\nWhen Epcot Center first opened, long, long ago, there'd been an ugly\r\ndecade or so in ride design. Imagineering found a winning formula for\r\nSpaceship Earth, the flagship ride in the big golf ball, and, in their\r\ndrive to establish thematic continuity, they'd turned the formula into a\r\ncookie-cutter, stamping out half a dozen clones for each of the \"themed\"\r\nareas in the Future Showcase. It went like this: first, we were cavemen,\r\nthen there was ancient Greece, then Rome burned (cue sulfur-odor FX),\r\nthen there was the Great Depression, and, finally, we reached the modern\r\nage. Who knows what the future holds? We do! We'll all have videophones\r\nand be living on the ocean floor. Once was cute -- compelling and\r\ninspirational, even -- but six times was embarrassing. Like everyone,\r\nonce Imagineering got themselves a good hammer, everything started to\r\nresemble a nail. Even now, the Epcot ad-hocs were repeating the sins of\r\ntheir forebears, closing every ride with a scene of Bitchun utopia.\r\n\r\nAnd Debra was repeating the classic mistake, tearing her way through the\r\nMagic Kingdom with her blaster set to flash-bake.\r\n\r\n\"Tim,\" I said, hearing the tremble in my voice. \"I thought you said that\r\nyou had no designs on the Mansion, that you and Debra wouldn't be trying\r\nto take it away from us. Didn't you say that?\"\r\n\r\nTim rocked back as if I'd slapped him and the blood drained from his\r\nface. \"But we're not taking it away!\" he said. \"You _invited_ us to\r\nhelp.\"\r\n\r\nI shook my head, confused. \"We did?\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Dan said. \"Kim and some of the other rehab cast went to Debra\r\nyesterday and asked her to do a design review of the current rehab and\r\nsuggest any changes. She was good enough to agree, and they've come up\r\nwith some great ideas.\" I read between the lines: the newbies you\r\ninvited in have gone over to the other side and we're going to lose\r\neverything because of them. I felt like shit.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I stand corrected,\" I said, carefully. Tim's grin came back and\r\nhe clapped his hands together. _He really loves the Mansion_, I thought.\r\n_He could have been on our side, if we had only played it all right._\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDan and I took to the utilidors and grabbed a pair of bicycles and sped\r\ntowards Suneep's lab, jangling our bells at the rushing castmembers.\r\n\"They don't have the authority to invite Debra in,\" I panted as we\r\npedaled.\r\n\r\n\"Says who?\" Dan said.\r\n\r\n\"It was part of the deal -- they knew that they were probationary\r\nmembers right from the start. They weren't even allowed into the design\r\nmeetings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Looks like they took themselves off probation,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSuneep gave us both a chilly look when we entered his lab. He had dark\r\ncircles under his eyes and his hands shook with exhaustion. He seemed to\r\nbe holding himself erect with nothing more than raw anger.\r\n\r\n\"So much for building without interference,\" he said. \"We agreed that\r\nthis project wouldn't change midway through. Now it has, and I've got\r\nother commitments that I'm going to have to cancel because this is going\r\noff-schedule.\"\r\n\r\nI made soothing apologetic gestures with my hands. \"Suneep, believe me,\r\nI'm just as upset about this as you are. We don't like this one little\r\nbit.\"\r\n\r\nHe harrumphed. \"We had a deal, Julius,\" he said, hotly. \"I would do the\r\nrehab for you and you would keep the ad-hocs off my back. I've been\r\nholding up my end of the bargain, but where the hell have you been? If\r\nthey replan the rehab now, I'll _have_ to go along with them. I can't\r\njust leave the Mansion half-done -- they'll murder me.\"\r\n\r\nThe kernel of a plan formed in my mind. \"Suneep, we don't like the new\r\nrehab plan, and we're going to stop it. You can help. Just stonewall\r\nthem -- tell them they'll have to find other Imagineering support if\r\nthey want to go through with it, that you're booked solid.\"\r\n\r\nDan gave me one of his long, considering looks, then nodded a minute\r\napproval. \"Yeah,\" he drawled. \"That'll help all right. Just tell 'em\r\nthat they're welcome to make any changes they want to the plan, _if_\r\nthey can find someone else to execute them.\"\r\n\r\nSuneep looked unhappy. \"Fine -- so then they go and find someone else to\r\ndo it, and that person gets all the credit for the work my team's done\r\nso far. I just flush my time down the toilet.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't come to that,\" I said quickly. \"If you can just keep saying no\r\nfor a couple days, we'll do the rest.\"\r\n\r\nSuneep looked doubtful.\r\n\r\n\"I promise,\" I said.\r\n\r\nSuneep ran his stubby fingers through his already crazed hair. \"All\r\nright,\" he said, morosely.\r\n\r\nDan slapped him on the back. \"Good man,\" he said.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nIt should have worked. It almost did.\r\n\r\nI sat in the back of the Adventureland conference room while Dan\r\nexhorted.\r\n\r\n\"Look, you don't have to roll over for Debra and her people! This is\r\n_your_ garden, and you've tended it responsibly for years. She's got no\r\nright to move in on you -- you've got all the Whuffie you need to defend\r\nthe place, if you all work together.\"\r\n\r\nNo castmember likes confrontation, and the Liberty Square bunch were\r\ntough to rouse to action. Dan had turned down the air conditioning an\r\nhour before the meeting and closed up all the windows, so that the room\r\nwas a kiln for hard-firing irritation into rage. I stood meekly in the\r\nback, as far as possible from Dan. He was working his magic on my\r\nbehalf, and I was content to let him do his thing.\r\n\r\nWhen Lil had arrived, she'd sized up the situation with a sour\r\nexpression: sit in the front, near Dan, or in the back, near me. She'd\r\nchosen the middle, and to concentrate on Dan I had to tear my eyes away\r\nfrom the sweat glistening on her long, pale neck.\r\n\r\nDan stalked the aisles like a preacher, eyes blazing. \"They're\r\n_stealing_ your future! They're _stealing_ your _past_! They claim\r\nthey've got your support!\"\r\n\r\nHe lowered his tone. \"I don't think that's true.\" He grabbed a\r\ncastmember by her hand and looked into her eyes. \"Is it true?\" he said\r\nso low it was almost a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" the castmember said.\r\n\r\nHe dropped her hand and whirled to face another castmember. \"Is it\r\ntrue?\" he demanded, raising his voice, slightly.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" the castmember said, his voice unnaturally loud after the\r\nwhispers. A nervous chuckle rippled through the crowd.\r\n\r\n\"Is it true?\" he said, striding to the podium, shouting now.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" the crowd roared.\r\n\r\n\"NO!\" he shouted back.\r\n\r\n\"You don't _have to_ roll over and take it! You can fight back, carry on\r\nwith the plan, send them packing. They're only taking over because\r\nyou're letting them. Are you going to let them?\"\r\n\r\n\"NO!\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nBitchun wars are rare. Long before anyone tries a takeover of anything,\r\nthey've done the arithmetic and ensured themselves that the ad-hoc\r\nthey're displacing doesn't have a hope of fighting back.\r\n\r\nFor the defenders, it's a simple decision: step down gracefully and\r\nsalvage some reputation out of the thing -- fighting back will surely\r\nburn away even that meager reward.\r\n\r\nNo one benefits from fighting back -- least of all the thing everyone's\r\nfighting over. For example:\r\n\r\nIt was the second year of my undergrad, taking a double-major in not\r\nmaking trouble for my profs and keeping my mouth shut. It was the early\r\ndays of Bitchun, and most of us were still a little unclear on the\r\nconcept.\r\n\r\nNot all of us, though: a group of campus shit-disturbers, grad students\r\nin the Sociology Department, were on the bleeding edge of the\r\nrevolution, and they knew what they wanted: control of the Department,\r\noustering of the tyrannical, stodgy profs, a bully pulpit from which to\r\npreach the Bitchun gospel to a generation of impressionable undergrads\r\nwho were too cowed by their workloads to realize what a load of shit\r\nthey were being fed by the University.\r\n\r\nAt least, that's what the intense, heavyset woman who seized the mic at\r\nmy Soc 200 course said, that sleepy morning mid-semester at Convocation\r\nHall. Nineteen hundred students filled the hall, a capacity crowd of\r\nbleary, coffee-sipping time-markers, and they woke up in a hurry when\r\nthe woman's strident harangue burst over their heads.\r\n\r\nI saw it happen from the very start. The prof was down there on the\r\nstage, a speck with a tie-mic, droning over his slides, and then there\r\nwas a blur as half a dozen grad students rushed the stage. They were\r\ndressed in University poverty-chic, wrinkled slacks and tattered sports\r\ncoats, and five of them formed a human wall in front of the prof while\r\nthe sixth, the heavyset one with the dark hair and the prominent mole on\r\nher cheek, unclipped his mic and clipped it to her lapel.\r\n\r\n\"Wakey wakey!\" she called, and the reality of the moment hit home for\r\nme: this wasn't on the lesson-plan.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, heads up! This is _not_ a drill. The University of Toronto\r\nDepartment of Sociology is under new management. If you'll set your\r\nhandhelds to 'receive,' we'll be beaming out new lesson-plans\r\nmomentarily. If you've forgotten your handhelds, you can download the\r\nplans later on. I'm going to run it down for you right now, anyway.\r\n\r\n\"Before I start though, I have a prepared statement for you. You'll\r\nprobably hear this a couple times more today, in your other classes.\r\nIt's worth repeating. Here goes:\r\n\r\n\"We reject the stodgy, tyrannical rule of the profs at this Department.\r\nWe demand bully pulpits from which to preach the Bitchun gospel.\r\nEffective immediately, the University of Toronto Ad-Hoc Sociology\r\nDepartment is _in charge_. We promise high-relevance curriculum with an\r\nemphasis on reputation economies, post-scarcity social dynamics, and the\r\nsocial theory of infinite life-extension. No more Durkheim, kids, just\r\ndeadheading! This will be _fun_.\"\r\n\r\nShe taught the course like a pro -- you could tell she'd been drilling\r\nher lecture for a while. Periodically, the human wall behind her\r\nshuddered as the prof made a break for it and was restrained.\r\n\r\nAt precisely 9:50 a.m. she dismissed the class, which had hung on her\r\nevery word. Instead of trudging out and ambling to our next class, the\r\nwhole nineteen hundred of us rose, and, as one, started buzzing to our\r\nneighbors, a roar of \"Can you believe it?\" that followed us out the door\r\nand to our next encounter with the Ad-Hoc Sociology Department.\r\n\r\nIt was cool, that day. I had another soc class, Constructing Social\r\nDeviance, and we got the same drill there, the same stirring propaganda,\r\nthe same comical sight of a tenured prof battering himself against a\r\nhuman wall of ad-hocs.\r\n\r\nReporters pounced on us when we left the class, jabbing at us with mics\r\nand peppering us with questions. I gave them a big thumbs-up and said,\r\n\"Bitchun!\" in classic undergrad eloquence.\r\n\r\nThe profs struck back the next morning. I got a heads-up from the\r\nnewscast as I brushed my teeth: the Dean of the Department of Sociology\r\ntold a reporter that the ad-hocs' courses would not be credited, that\r\nthey were a gang of thugs who were totally unqualified to teach. A\r\ncounterpoint interview from a spokesperson for the ad-hocs established\r\nthat all of the new lecturers had been writing course-plans and lecture\r\nnotes for the profs they replaced for years, and that they'd also\r\nwritten most of their journal articles.\r\n\r\nThe profs brought University security out to help them regain their\r\nlecterns, only to be repelled by ad-hoc security guards in homemade\r\nuniforms. University security got the message -- anyone could be\r\nreplaced -- and stayed away.\r\n\r\nThe profs picketed. They held classes out front attended by grade-\r\nconscious brown-nosers who worried that the ad-hocs' classes wouldn't\r\ncount towards their degrees. Fools like me alternated between the\r\noutdoor and indoor classes, not learning much of anything.\r\n\r\nNo one did. The profs spent their course-times whoring for Whuffie,\r\nleading the seminars like encounter groups instead of lectures. The\r\nad-hocs spent their time badmouthing the profs and tearing apart their\r\ncoursework.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the semester, everyone got a credit and the University\r\nSenate disbanded the Sociology program in favor of a distance-ed\r\noffering from Concordia in Montreal. Forty years later, the fight was\r\nsettled forever. Once you took backup-and-restore, the rest of the\r\nBitchunry just followed, a value-system settling over you.\r\n\r\nThose who didn't take backup-and-restore may have objected, but, hey,\r\nthey all died.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe Liberty Square ad-hocs marched shoulder to shoulder through the\r\nutilidors and, as a mass, took back the Haunted Mansion. Dan, Lil and I\r\nwere up front, careful not to brush against one another as we walked\r\nquickly through the backstage door and started a bucket-brigade, passing\r\nout the materials that Debra's people had stashed there, along a line\r\nthat snaked back to the front porch of the Hall of Presidents, where\r\nthey were unceremoniously dumped.\r\n\r\nOnce the main stash was vacated, we split up and roamed the ride, its\r\nservice corridors and dioramas, the break-room and the secret passages,\r\nrounding up every scrap of Debra's crap and passing it out the door.\r\n\r\nIn the attic scene, I ran into Kim and three of her giggly little\r\nfriends, their eyes glinting in the dim light. The gaggle of transhuman\r\nkids made my guts clench, made me think of Zed and of Lil and of my\r\nunmediated brain, and I had a sudden urge to shred them verbally.\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nNo. That way lay madness and war. This was about taking back what was\r\nours, not punishing the interlopers. \"Kim, I think you should leave,\" I\r\nsaid, quietly.\r\n\r\nShe snorted and gave me a dire look. \"Who died and made you boss?\" she\r\nsaid. Her friends thought it very brave, they made it clear with double-\r\njointed hip-thrusts and glares.\r\n\r\n\"Kim, you can leave now or you can leave later. The longer you wait, the\r\nworse it will be for you and your Whuffie. You blew it, and you're not a\r\npart of the Mansion anymore. Go home, go to Debra. Don't stay here, and\r\ndon't come back. Ever.\"\r\n\r\nEver. Be cast out of this thing that you love, that you obsess over,\r\nthat you worked for. \"Now,\" I said, quiet, dangerous, barely in control.\r\n\r\nThey sauntered into the graveyard, hissing vitriol at me. Oh, they had\r\nlots of new material to post to the anti-me sites, messages that would\r\nget them Whuffie with people who thought I was the scum of the earth. A\r\npopular view, those days.\r\n\r\nI got out of the Mansion and looked at the bucket-brigade, followed it\r\nto the front of the Hall. The Park had been open for an hour, and a herd\r\nof guests watched the proceedings in confusion. The Liberty Square\r\nad-hocs passed their loads around in clear embarrassment, knowing that they\r\nwere violating every principle they cared about.\r\n\r\nAs I watched, gaps appeared in the bucket-brigade as castmembers slipped\r\naway, faces burning scarlet with shame. At the Hall of Presidents, Debra\r\npresided over an orderly relocation of her things, a cheerful cadre of\r\nher castmembers quickly moving it all offstage. I didn't have to look at\r\nmy handheld to know what was happening to our Whuffie.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nBy evening, we were back on schedule. Suneep supervised the placement of\r\nhis telepresence rigs and Lil went over every system in minute detail,\r\nbossing a crew of ad-hocs that trailed behind her, double- and triple-\r\nchecking it all.\r\n\r\nSuneep smiled at me when he caught sight of me, hand-scattering dust in\r\nthe parlor.\r\n\r\n\"Congratulations, sir,\" he said, and shook my hand. \"It was masterfully\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Suneep. I'm not sure how masterful it was, but we got the job\r\ndone, and that's what counts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your partners, they're happier than I've seen them since this whole\r\nbusiness started. I know how they feel!\"\r\n\r\nMy partners? Oh, yes, Dan and Lil. How happy were they, I wondered.\r\nHappy enough to get back together? My mood fell, even though a part of\r\nme said that Dan would never go back to her, not after all we'd been\r\nthrough together.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you're glad. We couldn't have done it without you, and it\r\nlooks like we'll be open for business in a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I should think so. Are you coming to the party tonight?\"\r\n\r\nParty? Probably something the Liberty Square ad-hocs were putting on. I\r\nwould almost certainly be persona non grata. \"I don't think so,\" I said,\r\ncarefully. \"I'll probably work late here.\"\r\n\r\nHe chided me for working too hard, but once he saw that I had no\r\nintention of being dragged to the party, he left off.\r\n\r\nAnd that's how I came to be in the Mansion at 2 a.m. the next morning,\r\ndozing in a backstage break room when I heard a commotion from the\r\nparlor. Festive voices, happy and loud, and I assumed it was Liberty\r\nSquare ad-hocs coming back from their party.\r\n\r\nI roused myself and entered the parlor.\r\n\r\nKim and her friends were there, pushing hand-trucks of Debra's gear. I\r\ngot ready to shout something horrible at them, and that's when Debra\r\ncame in. I moderated the shout to a snap, opened my mouth to speak,\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\nBehind Debra were Lil's parents, frozen these long years in their\r\ncanopic jars in Kissimmee.\r\n\r\n========= CHAPTER 9 =========\r\n\r\nLil's parents went into their jars with little ceremony. I saw them just\r\nbefore they went in, when they stopped in at Lil's and my place to kiss\r\nher goodbye and wish her well.\r\n\r\nTom and I stood awkwardly to the side while Lil and her mother held an\r\nachingly chipper and polite farewell.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" I said to Tom. \"Deadheading.\"\r\n\r\nHe cocked an eyebrow. \"Yup. Took the backup this morning.\"\r\n\r\nBefore coming to see their daughter, they'd taken their backups. When\r\nthey woke, this event -- everything following the backup -- would never\r\nhave happened for them.\r\n\r\nGod, they were bastards.\r\n\r\n\"When are you coming back?\" I asked, keeping my castmember face on,\r\ncarefully hiding away the disgust.\r\n\r\n\"We'll be sampling monthly, just getting a digest dumped to us. When\r\nthings look interesting enough, we'll come on back.\" He waggled a finger\r\nat me. \"I'll be keeping an eye on you and Lillian -- you treat her\r\nright, you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're sure going to miss you two around here,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe pishtoshed and said, \"You won't even notice we're gone. This is your\r\nworld now -- we're just getting out of the way for a while, letting\r\nyou-all take a run at it. We wouldn't be going down if we didn't have\r\nfaith in you two.\"\r\n\r\nLil and her mom kissed one last time. Her mother was more affectionate\r\nthan I'd ever seen her, even to the point of tearing up a little. Here\r\nin this moment of vanishing consciousness, she could be whomever she\r\nwanted, knowing that it wouldn't matter the next time she awoke.\r\n\r\n\"Julius,\" she said, taking my hands, squeezing them. \"You've got some\r\nwonderful times ahead of you -- between Lil and the Park, you're going\r\nto have a tremendous experience, I just know it.\" She was infinitely\r\nserene and compassionate, and I knew it didn't count.\r\n\r\nStill smiling, they got into their runabout and drove away to get the\r\nlethal injections, to become disembodied consciousnesses, to lose their\r\nlast moments with their darling daughter.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThey were not happy to be returned from the dead. Their new bodies were\r\nimpossibly young, pubescent and hormonal and doleful and kitted out in\r\nthe latest trendy styles. In the company of Kim and her pals, they made\r\na solid mass of irate adolescence.\r\n\r\n\"Just what the hell do you think you're doing?\" Rita asked, shoving me\r\nhard in the chest. I stumbled back into my carefully scattered dust,\r\nraising a cloud.\r\n\r\nRita came after me, but Tom held her back. \"Julius, go away. Your\r\nactions are totally indefensible. Keep your mouth shut and go away.\"\r\n\r\nI held up a hand, tried to wave away his words, opened my mouth to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n\"Don't say a word,\" he said. \"Leave. Now.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Don't stay here and don't come back. Ever_,\" Kim said, an evil look on\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said. \"No goddamn it no. You're going to hear me out, and then\r\nI'm going to get Lil and her people and they're going to back me up.\r\nThat's not negotiable.\"\r\n\r\nWe stared at each other across the dim parlor. Debra made a twiddling\r\nmotion and the lights came up full and harsh. The expertly crafted gloom\r\nwent away and it was just a dusty room with a fake fireplace.\r\n\r\n\"Let him speak,\" Debra said. Rita folded her arms and glared.\r\n\r\n\"I did some really awful things,\" I said, keeping my head up, keeping my\r\neyes on them. \"I can't excuse them, and I don't ask you to forgive them.\r\nBut that doesn't change the fact that we've put our hearts and souls\r\ninto this place, and it's not right to take it from us. Can't we have\r\none constant corner of the world, one bit frozen in time for the people\r\nwho love it that way? Why does your success mean our failure?\r\n\r\n\"Can't you see that we're carrying on your work? That we're tending a\r\nlegacy you left us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you through?\" Rita asked.\r\n\r\nI nodded.\r\n\r\n\"This place is not a historical preserve, Julius, it's a ride. If you\r\ndon't understand that, you're in the wrong place. It's not my goddamn\r\nfault that you decided that your stupidity was on my behalf, and it\r\ndoesn't make it any less stupid. All you've done is confirm my worst\r\nfears.\"\r\n\r\nDebra's mask of impartiality slipped. \"You stupid, deluded asshole,\" she\r\nsaid, softly. \"You totter around, pissing and moaning about your little\r\nmurder, your little health problems -- yes, I've heard -- your little\r\nfixation on keeping things the way they are. You need some perspective,\r\nJulius. You need to get away from here: Disney World isn't good for you\r\nand you're sure as hell not any good for Disney World.\"\r\n\r\nIt would have hurt less if I hadn't come to the same conclusion myself,\r\nsomewhere along the way.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI found the ad-hoc at a Fort Wilderness campsite, sitting around a fire\r\nand singing, necking, laughing. The victory party. I trudged into the\r\ncircle and hunted for Lil.\r\n\r\nShe was sitting on a log, staring into the fire, a million miles away.\r\nLord, she was beautiful when she fretted. I stood in front of her for a\r\nminute and she stared right through me until I tapped her shoulder. She\r\ngave an involuntary squeak and then smiled at herself.\r\n\r\n\"Lil,\" I said, then stopped. _Your parents are home, and they've joined\r\nthe other side_.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in an age, she looked at me softly, smiled even. She\r\npatted the log next to her. I sat down, felt the heat of the fire on my\r\nface, her body heat on my side. God, how did I screw this up?\r\n\r\nWithout warning, she put her arms around me and hugged me hard. I hugged\r\nher back, nose in her hair, woodsmoke smell and shampoo and sweat. \"We\r\ndid it,\" she whispered fiercely. I held onto her. _No, we didn't_.\r\n\r\n\"Lil,\" I said again, and pulled away.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" she said, her eyes shining. She was stoned, I saw that now.\r\n\r\n\"Your parents are back. They came to the Mansion.\"\r\n\r\nShe was confused, shrinking, and I pressed on.\r\n\r\n\"They were with Debra.\"\r\n\r\nShe reeled back as if I'd slapped her.\r\n\r\n\"I told them I'd bring the whole group back to talk it over.\"\r\n\r\nShe hung her head and her shoulders shook, and I tentatively put an arm\r\naround her. She shook it off and sat up. She was crying and laughing at\r\nthe same time. \"I'll have a ferry sent over,\" she said.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI sat in the back of the ferry with Dan, away from the confused and\r\nangry ad-hocs. I answered his questions with terse, one-word answers,\r\nand he gave up. We rode in silence, the trees on the edges of the Seven\r\nSeas Lagoon whipping back and forth in an approaching storm.\r\n\r\nThe ad-hoc shortcutted through the west parking lot and moved through\r\nthe quiet streets of Frontierland apprehensively, a funeral procession\r\nthat stopped the nighttime custodial staff in their tracks.\r\n\r\nAs we drew up on Liberty Square, I saw that the work-lights were blazing\r\nand a tremendous work-gang of Debra's ad-hocs were moving from the Hall\r\nto the Mansion, undoing our teardown of their work.\r\n\r\nWorking alongside of them were Tom and Rita, Lil's parents, sleeves\r\nrolled up, forearms bulging with new, toned muscle. The group stopped in\r\nits tracks and Lil went to them, stumbling on the wooden sidewalk.\r\n\r\nI expected hugs. There were none. In their stead, parents and daughter\r\nstalked each other, shifting weight and posture to track each other,\r\nmaintain a constant, sizing distance.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell are you doing?\" Lil said, finally. She didn't address her\r\nmother, which surprised me. It didn't surprise Tom, though.\r\n\r\nHe dipped forward, the shuffle of his feet loud in the quiet night.\r\n\"We're working,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"No, you're not,\" Lil said. \"You're destroying. Stop it.\"\r\n\r\nLil's mother darted to her husband's side, not saying anything, just\r\nstanding there.\r\n\r\nWordlessly, Tom hefted the box he was holding and headed to the Mansion.\r\nLil caught his arm and jerked it so he dropped his load.\r\n\r\n\"You're not listening. The Mansion is _ours_. _Stop_. _It_.\"\r\n\r\nLil's mother gently took Lil's hand off Tom's arm, held it in her own.\r\n\"I'm glad you're passionate about it, Lillian,\" she said. \"I'm proud of\r\nyour commitment.\"\r\n\r\nEven at a distance of ten yards, I heard Lil's choked sob, saw her\r\ncollapse in on herself. Her mother took her in her arms, rocked her. I\r\nfelt like a voyeur, but couldn't bring myself to turn away.\r\n\r\n\"Shhh,\" her mother said, a sibilant sound that matched the rustling of\r\nthe leaves on the Liberty Tree. \"Shhh. We don't have to be on the same\r\nside, you know.\"\r\n\r\nThey held the embrace and held it still. Lil straightened, then bent\r\nagain and picked up her father's box, carried it to the Mansion. One at\r\na time, the rest of her ad-hoc moved forward and joined them.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThis is how you hit bottom. You wake up in your friend's hotel room and\r\nyou power up your handheld and it won't log on. You press the call-\r\nbutton for the elevator and it gives you an angry buzz in return. You\r\ntake the stairs to the lobby and no one looks at you as they jostle past\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nYou become a non-person.\r\n\r\nScared. I trembled when I ascended the stairs to Dan's room, when I\r\nknocked at his door, louder and harder than I meant, a panicked banging.\r\n\r\nDan answered the door and I saw his eyes go to his HUD, back to me.\r\n\"Jesus,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI sat on the edge of my bed, head in my hands.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" I said, what happened, what happened to me?\r\n\r\n\"You're out of the ad-hoc,\" he said. \"You're out of Whuffie. You're\r\nbottomed-out,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThis is how you hit bottom in Walt Disney World, in a hotel with the\r\nhissing of the monorail and the sun streaming through the window, the\r\nhooting of the steam engines on the railroad and the distant howl of the\r\nrecorded wolves at the Haunted Mansion. The world drops away from you,\r\nrecedes until you're nothing but a speck, a mote in blackness.\r\n\r\nI was hyperventilating, light-headed. Deliberately, I slowed my breath,\r\nput my head between my knees until the dizziness passed.\r\n\r\n\"Take me to Lil,\" I said.\r\n\r\nDriving together, hammering cigarette after cigarette into my face, I\r\nremembered the night Dan had come to Disney World, when I'd driven him\r\nto my -- _Lil's_ -- house, and how happy I'd been then, how secure.\r\n\r\nI looked at Dan and he patted my hand. \"Strange times,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIt was enough. We found Lil in an underground break-room, lightly dozing\r\non a ratty sofa. Her head rested on Tom's lap, her feet on Rita's. All\r\nthree snored softly. They'd had a long night.\r\n\r\nDan shook Lil awake. She stretched out and opened her eyes, looked\r\nsleepily at me. The blood drained from her face.\r\n\r\n\"Hello, Julius,\" she said, coldly.\r\n\r\nNow Tom and Rita were awake, too. Lil sat up.\r\n\r\n\"Were you going to tell me?\" I asked, quietly. \"Or were you just going\r\nto kick me out and let me find out on my own?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were my next stop,\" Lil said.\r\n\r\n\"Then I've saved you some time.\" I pulled up a chair. \"Tell me all about\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing to tell,\" Rita snapped. \"You're out. You had to know it\r\nwas coming -- for God's sake, you were tearing Liberty Square apart!\"\r\n\r\n\"How would you know?\" I asked. I struggled to remain calm. \"You've been\r\nasleep for ten years!\"\r\n\r\n\"We got updates,\" Rita said. \"That's why we're back -- we couldn't let\r\nit go on the way it was. We owed it to Debra.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Lillian,\" Tom said.\r\n\r\n\"And Lillian,\" Rita said, absently.\r\n\r\nDan pulled up a chair of his own. \"You're not being fair to him,\" he\r\nsaid. At least someone was on my side.\r\n\r\n\"We've been more than fair,\" Lil said. \"You know that better than\r\nanyone, Dan. We've forgiven and forgiven and forgiven, made every\r\nallowance. He's sick and he won't take the cure. There's nothing more we\r\ncan do for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could be his friend,\" Dan said. The light-headedness was back, and\r\nI slumped in my chair, tried to control my breathing, the panicked\r\nthumping of my heart.\r\n\r\n\"You could try to understand, you could try to help him. You could stick\r\nwith him, the way he stuck with you. You don't have to toss him out on\r\nhis ass.\"\r\n\r\nLil had the good grace to look slightly shamed. \"I'll get him a room,\"\r\nshe said. \"For a month. In Kissimmee. A motel. I'll pick up his network\r\naccess. Is that fair?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's more than fair,\" Rita said. Why did she hate me so much? I'd been\r\nthere for her daughter while she was away -- ah. That might do it, all\r\nright. \"I don't think it's warranted. If you want to take care of him,\r\nsir, you can. It's none of my family's business.\"\r\n\r\nLil's eyes blazed. \"Let me handle this,\" she said. \"All right?\"\r\n\r\nRita stood up abruptly. \"You do whatever you want,\" she said, and\r\nstormed out of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Why are you coming here for help?\" Tom said, ever the voice of reason.\r\n\"You seem capable enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to be taking a lethal injection at the end of the week,\" Dan\r\nsaid. \"Three days. That's personal, but you asked.\"\r\n\r\nTom shook his head. _Some friends you've got yourself_, I could see him\r\nthinking it.\r\n\r\n\"That soon?\" Lil asked, a throb in her voice.\r\n\r\nDan nodded.\r\n\r\nIn a dreamlike buzz, I stood and wandered out into the utilidor, out\r\nthrough the western castmember parking, and away.\r\n\r\nI wandered along the cobbled, disused Walk Around the World, each\r\nflagstone engraved with the name of a family that had visited the Park a\r\ncentury before. The names whipped past me like epitaphs.\r\n\r\nThe sun came up noon high as I rounded the bend of deserted beach\r\nbetween the Grand Floridian and the Polynesian. Lil and I had come here\r\noften, to watch the sunset from a hammock, arms around each other, the\r\nPark spread out before us like a lighted toy village.\r\n\r\nNow the beach was deserted, the Wedding Pavilion silent. I felt suddenly\r\ncold though I was sweating freely. So cold.\r\n\r\nDreamlike, I walked into the lake, water filling my shoes, logging my\r\npants, warm as blood, warm on my chest, on my chin, on my mouth, on my\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nI opened my mouth and inhaled deeply, water filling my lungs, choking\r\nand warm. At first I sputtered, but I was in control now, and I inhaled\r\nagain. The water shimmered over my eyes, and then was dark.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI woke on Doctor Pete's cot in the Magic Kingdom, restraints around my\r\nwrists and ankles, a tube in my nose. I closed my eyes, for a moment\r\nbelieving that I'd been restored from a backup, problems solved,\r\nmemories behind me.\r\n\r\nSorrow knifed through me as I realized that Dan was probably dead by\r\nnow, my memories of him gone forever.\r\n\r\nGradually, I realized that I was thinking nonsensically. The fact that I\r\nremembered Dan meant that I hadn't been refreshed from my backup, that\r\nmy broken brain was still there, churning along in unmediated isolation.\r\n\r\nI coughed again. My ribs ached and throbbed in counterpoint to my head.\r\nDan took my hand.\r\n\r\n\"You're a pain in the ass, you know that?\" he said, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" I choked.\r\n\r\n\"You sure are,\" he said. \"Lucky for you they found you -- another minute\r\nor two and I'd be burying you right now.\"\r\n\r\n_No_, I thought, confused. _They'd have restored me from backup_. Then\r\nit hit me: I'd gone on record refusing restore from backup after having\r\nit recommended by a medical professional. No one would have restored me\r\nafter that. I would have been truly and finally dead. I started to\r\nshiver.\r\n\r\n\"Easy,\" Dan said. \"Easy. It's all right now. Doctor says you've got a\r\ncracked rib or two from the CPR, but there's no brain damage.\"\r\n\r\n\"No _additional_ brain damage,\" Doctor Pete said, swimming into view. He\r\nhad on his professionally calm bedside face, and it reassured me despite\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nHe shooed Dan away and took his seat. Once Dan had left the room, he\r\nshone lights in my eyes and peeked in my ears, then sat back and\r\nconsidered me. \"Well, Julius,\" he said. \"What exactly is the problem? We\r\ncan get you a lethal injection if that's what you want, but offing\r\nyourself in the Seven Seas Lagoon just isn't good show. In the meantime,\r\nwould you like to talk about it?\"\r\n\r\nPart of me wanted to spit in his eye. I'd tried to talk about it and\r\nhe'd told me to go to hell, and now he changes his mind? But I did want\r\nto talk.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't want to die,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no?\" he said. \"I think the evidence suggests the contrary.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't trying to die,\" I protested. \"I was trying to --\" What? I was\r\ntrying to. . ._abdicate_. Take the refresh without choosing it, without\r\nshutting out the last year of my best friend's life. Rescue myself from\r\nthe stinking pit I'd sunk into without flushing Dan away along with it.\r\nThat's all, that's all.\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't thinking -- I was just acting. It was an episode or something.\r\nDoes that mean I'm nuts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, probably,\" Doctor Pete said, offhandedly. \"But let's worry about\r\none thing at a time. You can die if you want to, that's your right. I'd\r\nrather you lived, if you want my opinion, and I doubt that I'm the only\r\none, Whuffie be damned. If you're going to live, I'd like to record you\r\nsaying so, just in case. We have a backup of you on file -- I'd hate to\r\nhave to delete it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said. \"Yes, I'd like to be restored if there's no other\r\noption.\" It was true. I didn't want to die.\r\n\r\n\"All right then,\" Doctor Pete said. \"It's on file and I'm a happy man.\r\nNow, are you nuts? Probably. A little. Nothing a little counseling and\r\nsome R&R wouldn't fix, if you want my opinion. I could find you\r\nsomewhere if you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not yet,\" I said. \"I appreciate the offer, but there's something else I\r\nhave to do first.\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nDan took me back to the room and put me to bed with a transdermal\r\nsoporific that knocked me out for the rest of the day. When I woke, the\r\nmoon was over the Seven Seas Lagoon and the monorail was silent.\r\n\r\nI stood on the patio for a while, thinking about all the things this\r\nplace had meant to me for more than a century: happiness, security,\r\nefficiency, fantasy. All of it gone. It was time I left. Maybe back to\r\nspace, find Zed and see if I could make her happy again. Anywhere but\r\nhere. Once Dan was dead -- God, it was sinking in finally -- I could\r\ncatch a ride down to the Cape for a launch.\r\n\r\n\"What's on your mind?\" Dan asked from behind me, startling me. He was in\r\nhis boxers, thin and rangy and hairy.\r\n\r\n\"Thinking about moving on,\" I said.\r\n\r\nHe chuckled. \"I've been thinking about doing the same,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI smiled. \"Not that way,\" I said. \"Just going somewhere else, starting\r\nover. Getting away from this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going to take the refresh?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nI looked away. \"No,\" I said. \"I don't believe I will.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be none of my business,\" he said, \"but why the fuck not? Jesus,\r\nJulius, what're you afraid of?\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't want to know,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be the judge of that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let's have a drink, first,\" I said.\r\n\r\nDan rolled his eyes back for a second, then said, \"All right, two\r\nCoronas, coming up.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the room-service bot had left, we cracked the beers and pulled\r\nchairs out onto the porch.\r\n\r\n\"You sure you want to know this?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHe tipped his bottle at me. \"Sure as shootin',\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't want refresh because it would mean losing the last year,\" I\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \"By which you mean 'my last year,'\" he said. \"Right?\"\r\n\r\nI nodded and drank.\r\n\r\n\"I thought it might be like that. Julius, you are many things, but hard\r\nto figure out you are not. I have something to say that might help you\r\nmake the decision. If you want to hear it, that is.\"\r\n\r\nWhat could he have to say? \"Sure,\" I said. \"Sure.\" In my mind, I was on\r\na shuttle headed for orbit, away from all of this.\r\n\r\n\"I had you killed,\" he said. \"Debra asked me to, and I set it up. You\r\nwere right all along.\"\r\n\r\nThe shuttle exploded in silent, slow moving space, and I spun away from\r\nit. I opened and shut my mouth.\r\n\r\nIt was Dan's turn to look away. \"Debra proposed it. We were talking\r\nabout the people I'd met when I was doing my missionary work, the stone\r\ncrazies who I'd have to chase away after they'd rejoined the Bitchun\r\nSociety. One of them, a girl from Cheyenne Mountain, she followed me\r\ndown here, kept leaving me messages. I told Debra, and that's when she\r\ngot the idea.\r\n\r\n\"I'd get the girl to shoot you and disappear. Debra would give me\r\nWhuffie -- piles of it, and her team would follow suit. I'd be months\r\ncloser to my goal. That was all I could think about back then, you\r\nremember.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember.\" The smell of rejuve and desperation in our little cottage,\r\nand Dan plotting my death.\r\n\r\n\"We planned it, then Debra had herself refreshed from a backup -- no\r\nmemory of the event, just the Whuffie for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I said. That would work. Plan a murder, kill yourself, have\r\nyourself refreshed from a backup made before the plan. How many times\r\nhad Debra done terrible things and erased their memories that way?\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he agreed. \"We did it, I'm ashamed to say. I can prove it, too --\r\nI have my backup, and I can get Jeanine to tell it, too.\" He drained his\r\nbeer. \"That's my plan. Tomorrow. I'll tell Lil and her folks, Kim and\r\nher people, the whole ad-hoc. A going-away present from a shitty\r\nfriend.\"\r\n\r\nMy throat was dry and tight. I drank more beer. \"You knew all along,\" I\r\nsaid. \"You could have proved it at any time.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded. \"That's right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You let me. . .\" I groped for the words. \"You let me turn into. . .\"\r\nThey wouldn't come.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" he said.\r\n\r\nAll this time. Lil and he, standing on _my_ porch, telling me I needed\r\nhelp. Doctor Pete, telling me I needed refresh from backup, me saying\r\nno, no, no, not wanting to lose my last year with Dan.\r\n\r\n\"I've done some pretty shitty things in my day,\" he said. \"This is the\r\nabsolute worst. You helped me and I betrayed you. I'm sure glad I don't\r\nbelieve in God -- that'd make what I'm going to do even scarier.\"\r\n\r\nDan was going to kill himself in two days' time. My friend and my\r\nmurderer. \"Dan,\" I croaked. I couldn't make any sense of my mind. Dan,\r\ntaking care of me, helping me, sticking up for me, carrying this\r\nhorrible shame with him all along. Ready to die, wanting to go with a\r\nclean conscience.\r\n\r\n\"You're forgiven,\" I said. And it was true.\r\n\r\nHe stood.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"To find Jeanine, the one who pulled the trigger. I'll meet you at the\r\nHall of Presidents at nine a.m..\"\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nI went in through the Main Gate, not a castmember any longer, a Guest\r\nwith barely enough Whuffie to scrape in, use the water fountains and\r\nstand in line. If I were lucky, a castmember might spare me a chocolate\r\nbanana. Probably not, though.\r\n\r\nI stood in the line for the Hall of Presidents. Other guests checked my\r\nWhuffie, then averted their eyes. Even the children. A year before,\r\nthey'd have been striking up conversations, asking me about my job here\r\nat the Magic Kingdom.\r\n\r\nI sat in my seat at the Hall of Presidents, watching the short film with\r\nthe rest, sitting patiently while they rocked in their seats under the\r\nblast of the flash-bake. A castmember picked up the stageside mic and\r\nthanked everyone for coming; the doors swung open and the Hall was\r\nempty, except for me. The castmember narrowed her eyes at me, then\r\nrecognizing me, turned her back and went to show in the next group.\r\n\r\nNo group came. Instead, Dan and the girl I'd seen on the replay entered.\r\n\r\n\"We've closed it down for the morning,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI was staring at the girl, seeing her smirk as she pulled the trigger on\r\nme, seeing her now with a contrite, scared expression. She was terrified\r\nof me.\r\n\r\n\"You must be Jeanine,\" I said. I stood and shook her hand. \"I'm Julius.\"\r\n\r\nHer hand was cold, and she took it back and wiped it on her pants.\r\n\r\nMy castmember instincts took over. \"Please, have a seat. Don't worry,\r\nit'll all be fine. Really. No hard feelings.\" I stopped short of\r\noffering to get her a glass of water.\r\n\r\n_Put her at her ease_, said a snotty voice in my head. _She'll make a\r\nbetter witness. Or make her nervous, pathetic -- that'll work, too; make\r\nDebra look even worse_.\r\n\r\nI told the voice to shut up and got her a cup of water.\r\n\r\nBy the time I came back, the whole gang was there. Debra, Lil, her\r\nfolks, Tim. Debra's gang and Lil's gang, now one united team. Soon to be\r\nscattered.\r\n\r\nDan took the stage, used the stageside mic to broadcast his voice.\r\n\"Eleven months ago, I did an awful thing. I plotted with Debra to have\r\nJulius murdered. I used a friend who was a little confused at the time,\r\nused her to pull the trigger. It was Debra's idea that having Julius\r\nkilled would cause enough confusion that she could take over the Hall of\r\nPresidents. It was.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a roar of conversation. I looked at Debra, saw that she was\r\nsitting calmly, as though Dan had just accused her of sneaking an extra\r\nhelping of dessert. Lil's parents, to either side of her, were less\r\nsanguine. Tom's jaw was set and angry, Rita was speaking angrily to\r\nDebra. Hickory Jackson in the old Hall used to say, _I will hang the\r\nfirst man I can lay hands on from the first tree I can find_.\r\n\r\n\"Debra had herself refreshed from backup after we planned it,\" Dan went\r\non, as though no one was talking. \"I was supposed to do the same, but I\r\ndidn't. I have a backup in my public directory -- anyone can examine it.\r\nRight now, I'd like to bring Jeanine up, she's got a few words she'd\r\nlike to say.\"\r\n\r\nI helped Jeanine take the stage. She was still trembling, and the\r\nad-hocs were an insensate babble of recriminations. Despite myself,\r\nI was enjoying it.\r\n\r\n\"Hello,\" Jeanine said softly. She had a lovely voice, a lovely face. I\r\nwondered if we could be friends when it was all over. She probably\r\ndidn't care much about Whuffie, one way or another.\r\n\r\nThe discussion went on. Dan took the mic from her and said, \"Please! Can\r\nwe have a little respect for our visitor? Please? People?\"\r\n\r\nGradually, the din decreased. Dan passed the mic back to Jeanine.\r\n\"Hello,\" she said again, and flinched from the sound of her voice in the\r\nHall's PA. \"My name is Jeanine. I'm the one who killed Julius, a year\r\nago. Dan asked me to, and I did it. I didn't ask why. I trusted -- trust\r\n-- him. He told me that Julius would make a backup a few minutes before\r\nI shot him, and that he could get me out of the Park without getting\r\ncaught. I'm very sorry.\" There was something off-kilter about her, some\r\nstilt to her stance and words that let you know she wasn't all there.\r\nGrowing up in a mountain might do that to you. I snuck a look at Lil,\r\nwhose lips were pressed together. Growing up in a theme park might do\r\nthat to you, too.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, Jeanine,\" Dan said, taking back the mic. \"You can have a\r\nseat now. I've said everything I need to say -- Julius and I have had\r\nour own discussions in private. If there's anyone else who'd like to\r\nspeak --\"\r\n\r\nThe words were barely out of his mouth before the crowd erupted again in\r\nwords and waving hands. Beside me, Jeanine flinched. I took her hand and\r\nshouted in her ear: \"Have you ever been on the Pirates of the\r\nCarribean?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.\r\n\r\nI stood up and pulled her to her feet. \"You'll love it,\" I said, and led\r\nher out of the Hall.\r\n\r\n========== CHAPTER 10 ==========\r\n\r\nI booked us ringside seats at the Polynesian Luau, riding high on a\r\nfresh round of sympathy Whuffie, and Dan and I drank a dozen lapu-lapus\r\nin hollowed-out pineapples before giving up on the idea of getting\r\ndrunk.\r\n\r\nJeanine watched the fire-dances and the torch-lighting with eyes like\r\nsaucers, and picked daintily at her spare ribs with one hand, never\r\naverting her attention from the floor show. When they danced the fast\r\nhula, her eyes jiggled. I chuckled.\r\n\r\nFrom where we sat, I could see the spot where I'd waded into the Seven\r\nSeas Lagoon and breathed in the blood-temp water, I could see\r\nCinderella's Castle, across the lagoon, I could see the monorails and\r\nthe ferries and the busses making their busy way through the Park,\r\nshuttling teeming masses of guests from place to place. Dan toasted me\r\nwith his pineapple and I toasted him back, drank it dry and belched in\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\nFull belly, good friends, and the sunset behind a troupe of tawny, half-\r\nnaked hula dancers. Who needs the Bitchun Society, anyway?\r\n\r\nWhen it was over, we watched the fireworks from the beach, my toes dug\r\ninto the clean white sand. Dan slipped his hand into my left hand, and\r\nJeanine took my right. When the sky darkened and the lighted barges\r\nputtered away through the night, we three sat in the hammock.\r\n\r\nI looked out over the Seven Seas Lagoon and realized that this was my\r\nlast night, ever, in Walt Disney World. It was time to reboot again,\r\nstart afresh. That's what the Park was for, only somehow, this visit,\r\nI'd gotten stuck. Dan had unstuck me.\r\n\r\nThe talk turned to Dan's impending death.\r\n\r\n\"So, tell me what you think of this,\" he said, hauling away on a glowing\r\ncigarette.\r\n\r\n\"Shoot,\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm thinking -- why take lethal injection? I mean, I may be done here\r\nfor now, but why should I make an irreversible decision?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you want to before?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it was the macho thing, I guess. The finality and all. But hell, I\r\ndon't have to prove anything, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" I said, magnanimously.\r\n\r\n\"So,\" he said, thoughtfully. \"The question I'm asking is, how long can I\r\ndeadhead for? There are folks who go down for a thousand years, ten\r\nthousand, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"So, you're thinking, what, a million?\" I joked.\r\n\r\nHe laughed. \"A _million_? You're thinking too small, son. Try this on\r\nfor size: the heat death of the universe.\"\r\n\r\n\"The heat death of the universe,\" I repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" he drawled, and I sensed his grin in the dark. \"Ten to the\r\nhundred years or so. The Stelliferous Period -- it's when all the black\r\nholes have run dry and things get, you know, stupendously dull. Cold,\r\ntoo. So I'm thinking -- why not leave a wake-up call for some time\r\naround then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sounds unpleasant to me,\" I said. \"Brrrr.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all! I figure, self-repairing nano-based canopic jar, mass\r\nenough to feed it -- say, a trillion-ton asteroid -- and a lot of\r\nsolitude when the time comes around. I'll poke my head in every century\r\nor so, just to see what's what, but if nothing really stupendous crops\r\nup, I'll take the long ride out. The final frontier.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's pretty cool,\" Jeanine said.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" Dan said.\r\n\r\n\"You're not kidding, are you?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Nope, I sure ain't,\" he said.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThey didn't invite me back into the ad-hoc, even after Debra left in\r\nWhuffie-penury and they started to put the Mansion back the way it was.\r\nTim called me to say that with enough support from Imagineering, they\r\nthought they could get it up and running in a week. Suneep was ready to\r\nkill someone, I swear. _A house divided against itself can_not_ stand_,\r\nas Mr. Lincoln used to say at the Hall of Presidents.\r\n\r\nI packed three changes of clothes and a toothbrush in my shoulderbag and\r\nchecked out of my suite at the Polynesian at ten a.m., then met Jeanine\r\nand Dan at the valet parking out front. Dan had a runabout he'd picked\r\nup with my Whuffie, and I piled in with Jeanine in the middle. We played\r\nold Beatles tunes on the stereo all the long way to Cape Canaveral. Our\r\nshuttle lifted at noon.\r\n\r\nThe shuttle docked four hours later, but by the time we'd been through\r\ndecontam and orientation, it was suppertime. Dan, nearly as Whuffie-poor\r\nas Debra after his confession, nevertheless treated us to a meal in the\r\nbig bubble, squeeze-tubes of heady booze and steaky paste, and we\r\nwatched the universe get colder for a while.\r\n\r\nThere were a couple guys jamming, tethered to a guitar and a set of\r\ntubs, and they weren't half bad.\r\n\r\nJeanine was uncomfortable hanging there naked. She'd gone to space with\r\nher folks after Dan had left the mountain, but it was in a long-haul\r\ngeneration ship. She'd abandoned it after a year or two and deadheaded\r\nback to Earth in a support-pod. She'd get used to life in space after a\r\nwhile. Or she wouldn't.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Dan said.\r\n\r\n\"Yup,\" I said, aping his laconic drawl. He smiled.\r\n\r\n\"It's that time,\" he said.\r\n\r\nSpheres of saline tears formed in Jeanine's eyes, and I brushed them\r\naway, setting them adrift in the bubble. I'd developed some real tender,\r\nbrother-sister type feelings for her since I'd watched her saucer-eye\r\nher way through the Magic Kingdom. No romance -- not for me, thanks! But\r\ncamaraderie and a sense of responsibility.\r\n\r\n\"See you in ten to the hundred,\" Dan said, and headed to the airlock. I\r\nstarted after him, but Jeanine caught my hand.\r\n\r\n\"He hates long good-byes,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" I said, and watched him go.\r\n\r\n#\r\n\r\nThe universe gets older. So do I. So does my backup, sitting in\r\nredundant distributed storage dirtside, ready for the day that space or\r\nage or stupidity kills me. It recedes with the years, and I write out my\r\nlife longhand, a letter to the me that I'll be when it's restored into a\r\nclone somewhere, somewhen. It's important that whoever I am then knows\r\nabout this year, and it's going to take a lot of tries for me to get it\r\nright.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I'm working on another symphony, one with a little bit\r\nof \"Grim Grinning Ghosts,\" and a nod to \"It's a Small World After All,\"\r\nand especially \"There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nJeanine says it's pretty good, but what does she know? She's barely\r\nfifty.\r\n\r\nWe've both got a lot of living to do before we know what's what.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n================= Acknowledgements: =================\r\n\r\nI could never have written this book without the personal support of my\r\nfriends and family, especially Roz Doctorow, Gord Doctorow and Neil\r\nDoctorow, Amanda Foubister, Steve Samenski, Pat York, Grad Conn, John\r\nHenson, John Rose, the writers at the Cecil Street Irregulars and Mark\r\nFrauenfelder.\r\n\r\nI owe a great debt to the writers and editors who mentored and\r\nencouraged me: James Patrick Kelly, Judith Merril, Damon Knight, Martha\r\nSoukup, Scott Edelman, Gardner Dozois, Renee Wilmeth, Teresa Nielsen\r\nHayden, Claire Eddy, Bob Parks and Robert Killheffer.\r\n\r\nI am also indebted to my editor Patrick Nielsen Hayden and my agent\r\nDonald Maass, who believed in this book and helped me bring it to\r\nfruition.\r\n\r\nFinally, I must thank the readers, the geeks and the Imagineers who\r\ninspired this book.\r\n\r\nCory Doctorow San Francisco September 2002\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n================= About the author: =================\r\n\r\nCory Doctorow is Outreach Coordinator for the Electronic Frontier\r\nFoundation, www.eff.org, and maintains a personal site at\r\nwww.craphound.com.

He's lived long enough to see\r\nthe cure for death and the end of scarcity, to learn ten languages and\r\ncompose three symphonies...and to realize his boyhood dream of taking up\r\nresidence in Disney World.\r\n\r\nDisney World! The greatest artistic achievement of the long&#45;ago\r\ntwentieth century. Now in the care of a network of volunteer\r\n\"ad&#45;hocs\" who keep the classic attractions running as they always\r\nhave, enhanced with only the smallest high&#45;tech touches.\r\n\r\nNow, though, it seems the \"ad hocs\" are under attack. A new group has\r\ntaken over the Hall of the Presidents and is replacing its venerable\r\naudioanimatronics with new, immersive direct&#45;to&#45;brain interfaces\r\nthat give guests the illusion of being Washington, Lincoln, and all the\r\nothers. For Jules, this is an attack on the artistic purity of Disney\r\nWorld itself. Worse: it appears this new group has had Jules killed.\r\nThis upsets him. (It's only his fourth death and revival, after all.)\r\nNow it's war: war for the soul of the Magic Kingdom, a war of\r\never&#45;shifting reputations, technical wizardry, and entirely\r\nunpredictable outcomes.\r\n\r\nBursting with cutting&#45;edge speculation and human insight, Down and\r\nOut in the Magic Kingdom reads like Neal Stephenson meets Nick Hornby: a\r\ncoming&#45;of&#45;age romantic comedy and a kick&#45;butt cybernetic\r\ntour de force. </dc:description> <dc:creator><Agent> <dc:title>Cory\r\nDoctorow</dc:title> </Agent></dc:creator> <dc:rights><Agent>\r\n<dc:title>Cory Doctorow</dc:title> </Agent></dc:rights> <dc:type\r\nrdf:resource=\"http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/Text\" /> <license\r\nrdf:resource=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0\" />\r\n</Work>\r\n\r\n<License rdf:about=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd-nc/1.0\">\r\n<requires rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Attribution\" />\r\n<permits rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Reproduction\" />\r\n<permits rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Distribution\" />\r\n<prohibits rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/CommercialUse\" />\r\n<requires rdf:resource=\"http://web.resource.org/cc/Notice\" /> </License>\r\n\r\n</rdf:RDF>\r\n\r\n\r\neof\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, by Cory Doctorow",
