An elusive\r\nblending of tones now seemed pulsing with life; surely even a flickering\r\nflame of vitality would be blown into warm livingness in such a place.\r\n\r\nEven the chart case in the wall glittered with the same clean, brilliant\r\nhues from its glass and metal door. The usual revolving paper disks\r\nshowed white beyond the glass. They were moving; and the ink lines grew\r\nto tell a story of temperature and respiration and of every heart-beat.\r\n\r\nOn the identification-plate a name appeared and a date: \"Chet\r\nBullard--23 years. Admitted: August 10, 1973.\" And below that the\r\never-changing present ticked into the past in silent minutes: \"August\r\n15, 1973; World Standard Time: 10:38--10:39--10:40--\"\r\n\r\nFor five days the minutes had trickled into a rivulet of time that\r\nflowed past a bandaged figure in the bed below--a silent figure and\r\nunmoving, as one for whom time has ceased. But the surgeons of the\r\nAllied Hospital at Vienna are clever.\r\n\r\n10:41--10:42--The bandaged figure stirred uneasily on a snow-white\r\nbed....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA nurse was beside him in an instant. Was her patient about to recover\r\nconsciousness? She examined the bandages that covered a ragged wound in\r\nhis side, where all seemed satisfactory. To all appearances the man who\r\nhad moved was unconscious still; the nurse could not know of the thought\r\nimpressions, blurred at first, then gradually clearing, that were\r\nflashing through his mind.\r\n\r\nFlashing; yet, to the man who struggled to comprehend them, they passed\r\nlaggingly in review: one picture followed another with exasperating\r\nslowness....\r\n\r\nWhere was he? What had happened? He was hardly conscious of his own\r\nidentity....\r\n\r\nThere was a ship ... he held the controls ... they were flying low....\r\nOne hand reached fumblingly beneath the soft coverlet to search for a\r\ntriple star that should be upon his jacket. A triple star: the insignia\r\nof a Master Pilot of the World!--and with the movement there came\r\nclearly a realization of himself.\r\n\r\nChet Bullard, Master Pilot; he was Chet Bullard ... and a wall of water\r\nwas sweeping under him from the ocean to wipe out the great Harkness\r\nTerminal buildings.... It was Harkness--Walt Harkness--from whom he had\r\nsnatched the controls.... To fly to the Dark Moon, of course--\r\n\r\nWhat nonsense was that?... No, it was true: the Dark Moon had raised the\r\ndevil with things on Earth.... How slowly the thoughts came! Why\r\ncouldn't he remember?...\r\n\r\nDark Moon!--and they were flying through space.... They had conquered\r\nspace; they were landing on the Dark Moon that was brilliantly alight.\r\nWalt Harkness had set the ship down beautifully--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen, crowding upon one another in breath-taking haste, came clear\r\nrecollection of past adventures:\r\n\r\nThey were upon the Dark Moon--and there was the girl, Diane. They must\r\nsave Diane. Harkness had gone for the ship. A savage, half-human shape\r\nwas raising a hairy arm to drive a spear toward Diane, and he, Chet, was\r\nleaping before her. He felt again the lancet-pain of that blade....\r\n\r\nAnd now he was dying--yes, he remembered it now--dying in the night on a\r\ngreat, sweeping surface of frozen lava.... It was only a moment before\r\nthat he had opened his eyes to see Harkness' strained face and the\r\nagonized look of Diane as the two leaned above him.... But now he felt\r\nstronger. He must see them again....\r\n\r\nHe opened his eyes for another look at his companions--and, instead of\r\nblack, star-pricked night on a distant globe, there was dazzling\r\nsunlight. No desolate lava-flow, this; no thousand fires that flared and\r\nsmoked from their fumeroles in the dark. And, instead of Harkness and\r\nthe girl, Diane, leaning over him there was a nurse who laid one cool\r\nhand upon his blond head and who spoke soothingly to him of keeping\r\nquiet. He was to take it easy--he would understand later--and everything\r\nwas all right.... And with this assurance Chet Bullard drifted again\r\ninto sleep....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe blurring memories had lost their distortions a week later, as he sat\r\nbefore a broad window in his room and looked out over the housetops of\r\nVienna. Again he was himself, Chet Bullard, with a Master Pilot's\r\nrating; and he let his eyes follow understandingly the moving picture of\r\nthe world outside. It was good to be part of a world whose every\r\nmovement he understood.\r\n\r\nThose cylinders with stubby wings that crossed and recrossed the sky;\r\ntheir sterns showed a jet of thin vapor where a continuous explosion of\r\ndetonite threw them through the air. He knew them all: the pleasure\r\ncraft, the big, red-bellied freighters, the sleek liners, whose multiple\r\nhelicopters spun dazzlingly above as they sank down through the shaft of\r\npale-green light that marked a descending area.\r\n\r\nThat one would be the China Mail. Her under-ports were open before the\r\nhold-down clamps had gripped her; the mail would pour out in an\r\navalanche of pouches where smaller mailships waited to distribute the\r\ncargo across the land.\r\n\r\nAnd the big fellow taking off, her hull banded with blue, was one of\r\nSchwartzmann's liners. He wondered what had become of Schwartzmann, the\r\nman who had tried to rob Harkness of his ship; who had brought the\r\npatrol ships upon them in an effort to prevent their take-off on that\r\nwild trip.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, what had become of Harkness? Chet Bullard was seriously\r\ndisturbed at the absence of any word beyond the one message that had\r\nbeen waiting for him when he regained consciousness. He drew that\r\nmessage from a pocket of his dressing gown and read it again:\r\n\r\n     \"Chet, old fellow, lie low. S has vanished. Means mischief. Think\r\n     best not to see you or reveal your whereabouts until our position\r\n     firmly established. Have concealed ship. Remember, S will stop at\r\n     nothing. Trying to discredit us, but the gas I brought will fix all\r\n     that. Get yourself well. We are planning to go back, of course.\r\n     Walt.\"\r\n\r\nChet returned the folded message to his pocket. He arose and walked\r\nabout the room to test his returning strength: to remain idle was\r\nbecoming increasingly difficult. He wanted to see Walter Harkness, talk\r\nwith him, plan for their return to the wonder-world they had found.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstead he dropped again into his chair and touched a knob on the\r\nnewscaster beside him. A voice, hushed to the requirements of these\r\nhospital precincts spoke softly of market quotations in the far corners\r\nof the earth. He turned the dial irritably and set it on \"World\r\nNews--General.\" The name of Harkness came from the instrument to focus\r\nChet's attention.\r\n\r\n\"Harkness makes broad claims,\" the voice was saying. \"Vienna physicists\r\nridicule his pretensions.\r\n\r\n\"Walter Harkness, formerly of New York, proprietor of Harkness\r\nTerminals, whose great buildings near New York were destroyed in the\r\nDark Moon wave, claims to have reached and returned from the Dark Moon.\r\n\r\n\"Nearly two months have passed since the new satellite crashed into the\r\ngravitational field of Earth, its coming manifested by earth shocks and\r\na great tidal wave. The globe, as we know, was invisible. Although still\r\nunseen, and only a black circle that blocks out distant stars, it is\r\nvisible in the telescopes of the astronomers; its distance and its\r\norbital motion have been determined.\r\n\r\n\"And now this New Yorker claims to have penetrated space; to have landed\r\non the Dark Moon; and to have returned to Earth. Broad claims, indeed,\r\nespecially so in view of the fact that Harkness refuses to submit his\r\nship for examination by the Stratosphere Control Board. He has filed\r\nnotice of ownership, thus introducing some novel legal technicalities,\r\nbut, since space-travel is still a dream of the future, there will be\r\nnone to dispute his claims.\r\n\r\n\"Of immediate interest is Harkness' claim to have discovered a gas that\r\nis fatal to the serpents of space. The monsters that appeared when the\r\nDark Moon came and that attacked ships above the Repelling Area are\r\nstill there. All flying is confined to the lower levels; fast\r\nworld-routes are disorganized.\r\n\r\n\"Whether or not this gas, of which Harkness has a sample, came from the\r\nDark Moon or from some laboratory on Earth is of no particular\r\nimportance. Will it destroy the space-serpents? If it does this, our\r\nhats are off to Mr. Walter Harkness; almost will we be inclined to\r\nbelieve the rest of his story--or to laugh with him over one of the\r\ngreatest hoaxes ever attempted.\"\r\n\r\nChet had been too intent upon the newscast to heed an opening door at\r\nhis back....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"How about it, Chet?\" a voice was asking. \"Would you call it a hoax or\r\nthe real thing?\" And a girl's voice chimed in with exclamations of\r\ndelight at sight of the patient, so evidently recovering.\r\n\r\n\"Diane!\" Chet exulted, \"--and Walt!--you old son-of-a-gun!\" He found\r\nhimself clinging to a girl's soft hand with one of his, while with the\r\nother he reached for that of her companion. But Walt Harkness' arm went\r\nabout his shoulders instead.\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to hammer you plenty,\" Harkness was saying, \"and I don't even\r\ndare give you a friendly slam on the back. How's the side where they got\r\nyou with the spear?--and how are you? How soon will you be ready to\r\nstart back? What about--\"\r\n\r\nDiane Delacouer raised her one free hand to stop the flood of questions.\r\n\"My dear,\" she protested, \"give Chet a chance. He must be dying for\r\ninformation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was dying for another reason the last time I saw you,\" Chet reminded\r\nher, \"--up on the Dark Moon. But it seems that you got me back here in\r\ntime for repairs. And now what?\" His nurse came into the room with extra\r\nchairs; Chet waited till she was gone before he repeated: \"Now what?\r\nWhen do we go back?\"\r\n\r\nHarkness did not answer at once. Instead he crossed to the newscaster in\r\nits compact, metal case. The voice was still speaking softly; at a touch\r\nof a switch it ceased, and in the silence came the soft rush of sound\r\nthat meant the telautotype had taken up its work. Beneath a glass a\r\npaper moved, and words came upon it from a hurricane of type-bars\r\nunderneath. The instrument was printing the news story as rapidly as any\r\nvoice could speak it.\r\n\r\nHarkness read the words for an instant, then let the paper pass on to\r\nwind itself upon a spool. It had still been telling of the gigantic hoax\r\nthat this eccentric American had attempted and Harkness repeated the\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"A hoax!\" he exclaimed, and his eyes, for a moment, flashed angrily\r\nbeneath the dark hair that one hand had disarranged. \"I would like to\r\ntake that facetious bird out about a thousand miles and let him play\r\naround with the serpents we met. But, why get excited? This is all\r\nSchwartzmann's doing. The tentacles of that man's influence reach out\r\nlike those of an octopus.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet ranged himself alongside. Tall and slim and blond, he contrasted\r\nstrongly with this other man, particularly in his own quiet self-control\r\nas against Harkness' quick-flaring anger.\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy, Walt,\" he advised. \"We'll show them. But I judge that you\r\nhave been razzed a bit. It's a pretty big story for them to swallow\r\nwithout proof. Why didn't you show them the ship? Or why didn't you let\r\nDiane and me back up your yarn? And you haven't answered my other\r\nquestions: when do we go back?\"\r\n\r\nHarkness took the queries in turn.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't show the old boat,\" he explained, \"because I'm not ready for\r\nthat yet. I want it kept dark--dark as the Dark Moon. I want to do my\r\npreliminary work there before Schwartzmann and his experts see our ship.\r\nHe would duplicate it in a hurry and be on our trail.\r\n\r\n\"And now for our plans. Well, our there in space the Dark Moon is\r\nwaiting. Have you realized, Chet, that we own that world--you and Diane\r\nand I? Small--only half the size of our old moon--but what a place! And\r\nit's ours!\r\n\r\n\"Back in history--you remember?--an ambitious lad named Alexander sighed\r\nfor more worlds to conquer. Well, we're going Alexander one\r\nbetter--we've found the world. We're the first ever to go out into space\r\nand return again.\r\n\r\n\"We'll go back there, the three of us. We will take no others along--not\r\nyet. We will explore and make our plans for development; and we will\r\nkeep it to ourselves until we are ready to hold it against any\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\n\"And now, how soon can you go? Your injury--how soon will you be well\r\nenough?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right now,\" Chet told him laconically; \"today, if you say the word.\r\nThey've got me welded together so I'll hold, I reckon. But where's the\r\nship? What have you done--\" He broke off abruptly to listen--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo all three came a muffled, booming roar. The windows beside them\r\nshivered with the thud of the distant explosion; they had not ceased\r\ntheir trembling before Harkness had switched on the news broadcast. And\r\nit was a minute only until the news-gathering system was on the air.\r\n\r\n\"Explosion at the Institute of Physical Science!\" it stated. \"This is\r\nVienna broadcasting. An explosion has just occurred. We are giving a\r\npreliminary announcement only. The laboratories of the Scientific\r\nInstitute of this city are destroyed. A number of lives have been lost.\r\nThe cause has not been determined. It is reported that the laboratories\r\nwere beginning analytical work, on the so-called Harkness Dark Moon\r\ngas--\r\n\r\n\"Confirmation has just been radioed to this station. Dark Moon gas\r\nexploded on contact with air. The American, Harkness, is either a\r\ncriminal or a madman; he will be apprehended at once. This confirmation\r\ncomes from Herr Schwartzmann of Vienna who left the Institute only a few\r\nminutes before the explosion occurred--\"\r\n\r\nAnd, in the quiet of a hospital room, Walter Harkness drew a long breath\r\nand whispered; \"Schwartzmann! His hand is everywhere.... And that sample\r\nwas all I had.... I must leave at once--go back to America.\"\r\n\r\nHe was halfway to the door--he was almost carrying Diane Delacouer with\r\nhim--when Chet's quiet tones brought him up short.\r\n\r\n\"I've never seen you afraid,\" said Chet; and his eyes were regarding the\r\nother man curiously; \"but you seem to have the wind up, as the old\r\nflyers used to say, when it comes to Schwartzmann.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness looked at the girl he held so tightly, then grinned boyishly at\r\nChet. \"I've someone else to be afraid for now,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHis smile faded and was replaced by a look of deep concern. \"I haven't\r\ntold you about Schwartzmann,\" he said; \"haven't had time. But he's\r\npoison, Chet. And he's after our ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is the ship; where have you hidden it? Tell me--where?\"\r\n\r\nHarkness looked about him before he whispered sharply: \"Our old shop--up\r\nnorth!\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed to feel that some explanation was due Chet. \"In this day it\r\nseems absurd to say such things,\" he added; \"but this Schwartzmann is a\r\nthrow-back--a conscienceless scoundrel. He would put all three of us out\r\nof the way in a minute if he could get the ship. _He_ knows we have been\r\nto the Dark Moon--no question about that--and he wants the wealth he can\r\nimagine is there.\r\n\r\n\"We'll all plan to leave; I'll radio you later. We'll go back to the\r\nDark Moon--\" He broke off abruptly as the door opened to admit the\r\nnurse. \"You'll hear from me later,\" he repeated; and hurried Diane\r\nDelacouer from the room.\r\n\r\nBut he returned in a moment to stand again at the door--the nurse was\r\nstill in the room. \"In case you feel like going for a hop,\" he told Chet\r\ncasually, \"Diane's leaving her ship here for you. You'll find it up\r\nabove--private landing stage on the roof.\"\r\n\r\nChet answered promptly, \"Fine; that will go good one of these days.\" All\r\nthis for the benefit of listening ears. Yet even Chet would have been\r\nastonished to know that he would be using that ship within an hour....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was standing at the window, and his mind was filled, not with\r\nthoughts of any complications that had developed for his friend\r\nHarkness, but only of the adventures that lay ahead of them both. The\r\nDark Moon!--they had reached it, indeed; but they had barely scratched\r\nthe surface of that world of mystery and adventure. He was wild with\r\neagerness to return--to see again that new world, blazing brightly\r\nbeneath the sun; to see the valley of fires--and he had a score to\r\nsettle with the tribe of ape-men, unless Harkness had finished them off\r\nwhile he, himself, lay unconscious.... Yes, there seemed little doubt of\r\nthat; Walt would have paid the score for all of them.... He seemed\r\nactually back in that world to which his thoughts went winging across\r\nthe depths of space. The buzz of a telephone recalled him.\r\n\r\nIt was the hospital office, he found, when he answered. There was a\r\nmessage--would Mr. Bullard kindly receive it on the telautotype--lever\r\nnumber four, and dial fifteen-point-two--thanks.... And Chet depressed a\r\nkey and adjusted the instrument that had been printing the newscast.\r\n\r\nThe paper moved on beneath the glass, and the type-bars clicked more\r\nslowly now. From some distant station that might be anywhere on or above\r\nthe earth, there was coming a message.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of that sending current was changed at some central\r\noffice; it was stepped down to suit the instrument beside him. And the\r\ntype was spelling out words that made the watching man breathless and\r\nintent--until he tore off the paper and leaped for the call signal that\r\nwould summon the nurse. Through her he would get his own clothes, his\r\nuniform, the triple star that showed his rating and his authority in\r\nevery air-level of the world.\r\n\r\nThat badge would have got him immediate attention on any landing field.\r\nNow, on the flat roof, with steady, gray eyes and a voice whose very\r\nquietness accentuated its imperative commands, Chet had the staff of the\r\nhospital hangars as alert as if their alarm had sounded a general\r\nambulance call.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStraight into the sky a red beacon made a rigid column of light; a radio\r\nsender was crackling a warning and a demand for \"clear air.\" From the\r\nforty level, a patrol ship that had caught the signal came corkscrewing\r\ndown the red shaft to stand by for emergency work.... Chet called her\r\ncommander from the cabin of Diane's ship. A word of thanks--Chet's\r\nnumber--and a dismissal of the craft. Then the white lights signaled\r\n\"all clear\" and the hold-down levers let go with a soft hiss--\r\n\r\nThe feel of the controls was good to his hands; the ship roared into\r\nlife. A beautiful little cruiser, this ship of Diane's; her twin\r\nhelicopters lifted her gracefully into the air. The column of red light\r\nhad changed to blue, the mark of an ascending area; Chet touched a\r\nswitch. A muffled roar came from the stern and the blast drove him\r\nstraight out for a mile; then he swung and returned. He was nosing up as\r\nhe touched the blue--straight up--and he held the vertical climb till\r\nthe altimeter before him registered sixty thousand.\r\n\r\nTraffic is north-bound only on the sixty-level, and Chet set his ship on\r\na course for the frozen wastes of the Arctic; then he gave her the gun\r\nand nodded in tight-lipped satisfaction at the mounting thunder that\r\nanswered from the stern.\r\n\r\nOnly then did he read again the message on a torn fragment of\r\ntelautotype paper. \"Harkness,\" was the signature; and above, a brief\r\nwarning and a call--\"Danger--must leave at once. You get ship and stand\r\nby. I will meet you there.\" And, for the first time, Chet found time to\r\nwonder at this danger that had set the hard-headed, hard-hitting Walt\r\nHarkness into a flutter of nerves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat danger could there be in this well-guarded world? A patrol-ship\r\npassed below him as he asked himself the question. It was symbolic of a\r\nworld at peace; a world too busy with its own tremendous development to\r\nfind time for wars or makers of war. What trouble could this man\r\nSchwartzmann threaten that a word to the Peace Enforcement Commission\r\nwould not quell? Where could he go to elude the inescapable patrols?\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly Chet saw the answer to that question--saw plainly where\r\nSchwartzmann could go. Those vast reaches of black space! If\r\nSchwartzmann had their ship he could go where they had gone--go out to\r\nthe Dark Moon.... And Harkness had warned Chet to get their ship and\r\nstand by.\r\n\r\nHad Walt learned of some plan of Schwartzmann's? Chet could not answer\r\nthe question, but he moved the control rheostat over to the last notch.\r\n\r\nFrom the body of the craft came an unending roar of a generator where\r\nnothing moved; where only the terrific, explosive impact of bursting\r\ndetonite drove out from the stern to throw them forward. \"A good little\r\nship,\" Chet had said of this cruiser of Diane's; and he nodded approval\r\nnow of a ground-speed detector whose quivering needle had left the 500\r\nmark. It touched 600, crept on, and trembled at 700 miles an hour with\r\nthe top speed of the ship.\r\n\r\nThere was a position-finder in the little control-room, and Chet's gaze\r\nreturned to it often to see the pinpoint of light that crept slowly\r\nacross the surface of a globe. It marked their ever-changing location,\r\nand it moved unerringly toward a predetermined goal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a place of ice and snow and bleak outcropping of half-covered\r\nrocks where he descended. Lost from the world, a place where even the\r\nhigh levels seldom echoed to the roar of passing ships, it had been a\r\nperfect location for their \"shop.\" Here he and Walt had assembled their\r\nmystery ship.\r\n\r\nHe had to search intently over the icy waste to find the exact location;\r\na dim red glow from a hidden sun shone like pale fire across distant\r\nblack hills. But the hills gave him a bearing, and he landed at last\r\nbeside a vaguely outlined structure, half hidden in drifting snow.\r\n\r\nThe dual fans dropped him softly upon the snow ground and Chet, as he\r\nwalked toward the great locked doors, was trembling from other causes\r\nthan the cold. Would the ship be there? He was suddenly a-quiver with\r\nexcitement at the thought of what this ship meant--the adventure, the\r\nexploration that lay ahead.\r\n\r\nThe doors swung back. In the warm and lighted room was a cylinder of\r\nsilvery white. Its bow ended in a gaping port where a mighty exhaust\r\ncould roar forth to check the ship's forward speed; there were other\r\nports ranged about the gleaming body. Above the hull a control-room\r\nprojected flatly; its lookouts shone in the brilliance of the nitron\r\nilluminator that flooded the room with light....\r\n\r\nChet Bullard was breathless as he moved on and into the room. His wild\r\nexperiences that had seemed but a weird dream were real again. The Dark\r\nMoon was real! And they would be going back to it!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe muffled beating of great helicopters was sounding in his ears;\r\noutside, a ship was landing. This would be Harkness coming to join him;\r\nyet, even as the thought flashed through his mind, it was countered by a\r\nquick denial. To the experienced hearing of the Master Pilot this sound\r\nof many fans meant no little craft. It was a big ship that was landing,\r\nand it was coming down fast. The blue-striped monster looming large in\r\nthe glow of the midnight sun was not entirely a surprise to Chet's\r\nstaring eyes.\r\n\r\nBut--blue-striped! The markings of the Schwartzmann line!--He had hardly\r\nsensed the danger when it was upon him.\r\n\r\nA man, heavy and broad of frame, was giving orders. Only once had Chet\r\nseen this Herr Schwartzmann, but there was no mistaking him now. And he\r\nwas sending a squad of rushing figures toward the man who struggled to\r\nclose a great door.\r\n\r\nChet crouched to meet the attack. He was outnumbered; he could never win\r\nout. But the knowledge of his own helplessness was nothing beside that\r\nother conviction that flooded him with sickening certainty--\r\n\r\nA hoax!--that was what they had called Walt's story; Schwartzmann had so\r\nnamed it, and now Schwartzmann had been the one to fool them; the\r\nmessage was a fake--a bait to draw him out; and he, Chet, had taken the\r\nbait. He had led Schwartzmann here; had delivered their ship into his\r\nhands--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _He landed one blow on the nearest face._]\r\n\r\nHe landed one blow on the nearest face; he had one glimpse of a clubbed\r\nweapon swinging above him--and the world went dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_Into Space_\r\n\r\n\r\nA pulsing pain that stabbed through his head was Chet's first conscious\r\nimpression. Then, as objects came slowly into focus before his eyes, he\r\nknew that above him a ray of light was striking slantingly through the\r\nthick glass of a control-room lookout.\r\n\r\nOther lookouts were black, the dead black of empty space. Through them,\r\nsparkling points of fire showed here and there--suns, sending their\r\nlight across millions of years to strike at last on a speeding ship.\r\nBut, from the one port that caught the brighter light, came that\r\nstraight ray to illumine the room.\r\n\r\n\"Space,\" thought Chet vaguely. \"That is the sunlight of space!\"\r\n\r\nHe was trying to arrange his thoughts in some sensible sequence. His\r\nhead!--what had happened to his head?... And then he remembered. Again\r\nhe saw a clubbed weapon descending, while the face of Schwartzmann\r\nstared at him through bulbous eyes....\r\n\r\nAnd this control-room where he lay--he knew in an instant where he was.\r\nIt was his own ship that was roaring and trembling beneath him--his and\r\nWalt Harkness'--it was flying through space! And, with the sudden\r\nrealization of what this meant, he struggled to arise. Only then did he\r\nsee the figure at the controls.\r\n\r\nThe man was leaning above an instrument board; he straightened to stare\r\nfrom a rear port while he spoke to someone Chet could not see.\r\n\r\n\"There's more of 'em coming!\" he said in a choked voice. \"_Mein Gott!_\r\nNeffer can we get away!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe fumbled with shaking hands at instruments and controls; and now Chet\r\nsaw his chalk-white face and read plainly the terror that was written\r\nthere. But the cords that cut into his own wrists and ankles reminded\r\nhim that he was bound; he settled back upon the floor. Why struggle? If\r\nthis other pilot was having trouble let him get out of it by\r\nhimself--let him kill his own snakes!\r\n\r\nThat the man was having trouble there was no doubt. He looked once more\r\nbehind him as if at something that pursued; then swung the ball-control\r\nto throw the ship off her course.\r\n\r\nThe craft answered sluggishly, and Chet Bullard grinned where he lay\r\nhelpless upon the floor; for he knew that his ship should have been\r\nthrown crashingly aside with such a motion as that. The answer was\r\nplain: the flask of super-detonite was exhausted; here was the last\r\nfeeble explosion of the final atoms of the terrible explosive that was\r\nbeing admitted to the generator. And to cut in another flask meant the\r\nopening of a hidden valve.\r\n\r\nChet forgot the pain of his swelling hands to shake with suppressed\r\nmirth. This was going to be good! He forgot it until, through a lookout,\r\nhe saw a writhing, circling fire that wrapped itself about the ship and\r\njarred them to a halt.\r\n\r\nThe serpents!--those horrors from space that had come with the coming of\r\nthe Dark Moon! They had disrupted the high-level traffic of the world;\r\nhad seized great, liners; torn their way in; stripped them of every\r\nliving thing, and let the empty shells crash back to earth. Chet had\r\nforgotten or he had failed to realize the height at which this new pilot\r\nwas flying. Only speed could save them; the monsters, with their snouts\r\nthat were great suction-cups, could wrench off a metal door--tear out\r\nthe glass from a port!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe saw the luminous mass crush itself against a forward lookout and felt\r\nthe jar of its body against their ship. Soft and vaporous, these\r\ncloud-like serpents seemed as they drifted through space; yet the\r\nimpact, when they struck, proved that this new matter had mass.\r\n\r\nChet saw the figure at the controls stagger back and cower in fear; the\r\nman's bullet-shaped head was covered by his upraised arms: there was\r\nsome horror outside those windows that his eyes had no wish to see.\r\nBeside him the towering figure of Schwartzmann appeared; he had sprung\r\ninto Chet's view, and he screamed orders at the fear-stricken pilot.\r\n\r\n\"Fool! Swine!\" Schwartzmann was shouting. \"Do something! You said you\r\ncould fly this ship!\" In desperation he leaped forward and reached for\r\nthe controls himself.\r\n\r\nChet's blurred faculties snapped sharply to attention. That yellow glow\r\nagainst the port--the jarring of their ship--it meant instant\r\ndestruction once that searching snout found some place where it could\r\nsecure a hold. If the air-pressure within the ship were released; if\r\neven a crack were opened!--\r\n\r\n\"Here, you!\" he shouted to the frantic Schwartzmann who was jerking\r\nfrenziedly at the controls that no longer gave response. \"Cut these\r\nropes!--leave those instruments alone, you fool!\" He was suddenly\r\nvibrant with hate as he realized what this man had done: he had struck\r\nhim, Chet, down as he would have felled an animal for butchery; he had\r\nstolen their ship; and now he was losing it. Chet hardly thought of his\r\nown desperate plight in his rage at this threat to their ship, and at\r\nSchwartzmann's inability to help himself.\r\n\r\n\"Cut these ropes!\" he repeated. \"Damn it all, turn me loose; I can fly\r\nus out!\" He added his frank opinion of Schwartzmann and all his men. And\r\nSchwartzmann, though his dark face flushed angrily red for one instant,\r\nleaped to Chet's side and slashed at the cords with a knife.\r\n\r\nThe room swam before Chet's dizzy eyes as he came to his feet. He half\r\nfell, half drew himself full length toward the valve that he alone knew.\r\nThen again he was on his feet, and he gripped at the ball-control with\r\none hand while he opened a master throttle that cut in this new supply\r\nof explosive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe room had been silent with the silence of empty space, save only for\r\nthe scraping of a horrid body across the ship's outer shell. The silence\r\nwas shattered now as if by the thunder of many guns. There was no time\r\nfor easing themselves into gradual flight. Chet thrust forward on the\r\nball-control, and the blast from their stern threw the ship as if it had\r\nbeen fired from a giant cannon.\r\n\r\nThe self-compensating floor swung back and up; Chet's weight was almost\r\nunbearable as the ship beneath him leaped out and on, and the terrific\r\nblast that screamed and thundered urged this speeding shell to greater\r\nand still greater speed. And then, with the facility that that speed\r\ngave, Chet's careful hands moved a tiny metal ball within its magnetic\r\ncage, and the great ship bellowed from many ports as it followed the\r\nmotion of that ball.\r\n\r\nCould an eye have seen the wild, twisting flight, it must have seemed as\r\nif pilot and ship had gone suddenly mad. The craft corkscrewed and\r\nwhirled; it leaped upward and aside; and, as the glowing mass was thrown\r\nclear of the lookout, Chet's hand moved again to that maximum forward\r\nposition, and again the titanic blast from astern drove them on and out.\r\n\r\nThere were other shapes ahead, glowing lines of fire, luminous masses\r\nlike streamers of cloud that looped themselves into contorted forms and\r\nwrithed vividly until they straightened into sharp lines of speed that\r\nbore down upon the fleeing craft and the human food that was escaping\r\nthese hungry snouts.\r\n\r\nChet saw them dead ahead; he saw the outthrust heads, each ending in a\r\ngreat suction-cup, the row of disks that were eyes blazing above, and\r\nthe gaping maw below. He altered their course not a hair's breadth as he\r\nbore down upon them, while the monsters swelled prodigiously before his\r\neyes. And the thunderous roar from astern came with never a break, while\r\nthe ship itself ceased its trembling protest against the sudden blast\r\nand drove smoothly on and into the waiting beasts.\r\n\r\nThere was a hardly perceptible thudding jar. They were free! And the\r\nforward lookouts showed only the brilliant fires of distant suns and one\r\nmore glorious than the rest that meant a planet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet turned at last to face Schwartzmann and his pilot where they had\r\nclung helplessly to a metal stanchion. Four or five others crept in from\r\nthe cabin aft; their blanched faces told of the fear that had gripped\r\nthem--fear of the serpents; fear, too, of the terrific plunges into\r\nwhich the ship had been thrown. Chet Bullard drew the metal control-ball\r\nback into neutral and permitted himself the luxury of a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"You're a fine bunch of highwaymen,\" he told Schwartzmann; \"you'll steal\r\na ship you can't fly; then come up here above the R. A. level and get\r\nmixed up with those brutes. What's the idea? Did you think you would\r\njust hop over to the Dark Moon? Some little plan like that in your\r\nmind?\"\r\n\r\nAgain the dark, heavy face of Schwartzmann flushed deeply; but it was\r\nhis own men upon whom he turned.\r\n\r\n\"You,\" he told the pilot--\"you were so clever; you would knock this man\r\nsenseless! You would insist that you could fly the ship!\"\r\n\r\nThe pilot's eyes still bulged with the fear he had just experienced.\r\n\"But, Herr Schwartzmann, it was you who told me--\"\r\n\r\nA barrage of unintelligible words cut his protest short. Schwartzmann\r\npoured forth imprecations in an unknown tongue, then turned to the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n\"Back!\" he ordered. \"Bah!--such men! The danger it iss over--yess! This\r\npilot, he will take us back safely.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned his attention now to the waiting Chet. \"Herr Bullard, iss it\r\nnot--yess?\"\r\n\r\nHe launched into extended apologies--he had wanted a look at this so\r\nmarvelous ship--he had spied upon it; he admitted it. But this murderous\r\nattack was none of his doing; his men had got out of hand; and then he\r\nhad thought it best to take Chet, unconscious as he was and return with\r\nhim where he could have care.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd Chet Bullard kept his eyes steadily upon the protesting man and said\r\nnothing, but he was thinking of a number of things. There was Walt's\r\nwarning, \"this Schwartzmann means mischief,\" and the faked message that\r\nhad brought him from the hospital to get the ship from its hiding place;\r\nno, it was too much to believe. But Chet's eyes were unchanging, and he\r\nnodded shortly in agreement as the other concluded.\r\n\r\n\"You will take us back?\" Schwartzmann was asking. \"I will repay you well\r\nfor what inconvenience we have caused. The ship, you will return it\r\nsafely to the place where it was?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chet, after making and discarding a score of plans, knew there was\r\nnothing else he could do. He swung the little metal ball into a\r\nsharply-banked turn. The straight ray of light from an impossibly\r\nbrilliant sun struck now on a forward lookout; it shone across the\r\nshoulder of a great globe to make a white, shining crescent as of a\r\ngiant moon. It was Earth; and Chet brought the bow-sights to bear on\r\nthat far-off target, while again the thunderous blast was built up to\r\ndrive them back along the trackless path on which they had come. But he\r\nwondered, as he pressed forward on the control, what the real plan of\r\nthis man, Schwartzmann, might be....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLess than half an hour brought them to the Repelling Area, and Chet felt\r\nthe upward surge as he approached it. Here, above this magnetic field\r\nwhere gravitation's pull was nullified, had been the air-lanes for fast\r\nliners. Empty lanes they were now; for the R. A., as the flying\r\nfraternity knew it--the Heaviside Layer of an earlier day--marked the\r\ndanger line above which the mysterious serpents lay in wait. Only the\r\nspeed of Chet's ship saved them; more than one of the luminous monsters\r\nwas in sight as he plunged through the invisible R. A. and threw on\r\ntheir bow-blast strongly to check their fall.\r\n\r\nThen, as he set a course that would take them to that section of the\r\nArctic waste where the ship had been, he pondered once more upon the\r\nsubject of this Schwartzmann of the shifty eyes and the glib tongue and\r\nof his men who had \"got out of hand\" and had captured this ship.\r\n\r\n\"Why in thunder are we back here?\" Chet asked himself in perplexity.\r\n\"This big boy means to keep the ship; and, whatever his plans may have\r\nbeen before, he will never stop short of the Dark Moon now that he has\r\nseen the old boat perform. Then why didn't he keep on when he was\r\nstarted? Had the serpents frightened him back?\"\r\n\r\nHe was still mentally proposing questions to which there seemed no\r\nanswer when he felt the pressure of a metal tube against his back. The\r\nvoice of Schwartzmann was in his ears.\r\n\r\n\"This is a detonite pistol\"--that voice was no longer unctuous and\r\nself-deprecating--\"one move and I'll plant a charge inside you that will\r\nsmash you to a jelly!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were hands that gripped Chet before he could turn; his arms were\r\nwrenched backward; he was helpless in the grip of Schwartzmann's men.\r\nThe former pilot sprang forward.\r\n\r\n\"Take control, Max!\" Schwartzmann snapped; but he followed it with a\r\nquestion while the pilot was reaching for the ball. \"You can fly it for\r\nsure, Max?\"\r\n\r\nThe man called Max answered confidently.\r\n\r\n\"_Ja wohl!_\" he said with eager assurance. \"Up top there would have been\r\nno trouble yet for that _verdammt, verloren_ valve. That one\r\nexperimental trip is enough--I fly it!\"\r\n\r\nThose who held Chet were binding his wrists. He was thrown to the floor\r\nwhile his feet were tied, and, as a last precaution, a gag was forced\r\ninto his mouth. Schwartzmann left this work to his men. He paid no\r\nattention to Chet; he was busy at the radio.\r\n\r\nHe placed the sending-levers in strange positions that would effect a\r\nblending of wave lengths which only one receiving instrument could pick\r\nup. He spoke cryptic words into the microphone, then dropped into a\r\nlanguage that was unfamiliar to Chet. Yet, even then, it was plain that\r\nhe was giving instructions, and he repeated familiar words.\r\n\r\n\"Harkness,\" Chet heard him say, and, \"--Delacouer--_ja!_--Mam'selle\r\nDelacouer!\"\r\n\r\nThen, leaving the radio, he said, \"Put my ship inside the hangar;\" and\r\nthe pilot, Max, grounded their own ship to allow the men to leap out and\r\nfloat into the big building the big aircraft in which Schwartzmann had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n\"Now close the doors!\" their leader ordered. \"Leave everything as it\r\nwas!\" And to the pilot he gave added instructions: \"There iss no air\r\ntraffic here. You will to forty thousand ascend, und you will wait over\r\nthis spot.\" Contemptuously he kicked aside the legs of the bound man\r\nthat he might walk back into the cabin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe take-off was not as smooth as it would have been had Chet's slim\r\nhands been on the controls; this burly one who handled them now was not\r\naccustomed to such sensitivity. But Chet felt the ship lift and lurch,\r\nthen settle down to a swift, spiralling ascent. Now he lay still as he\r\ntried to ponder the situation.\r\n\r\n\"Now what dirty work are they up to?\" he asked himself. He had seen a\r\nsullen fury on the dark face of Herr Schwartzmann as he spoke the names\r\nof Walt and Diane into the radio. Chet remembered the look now, and he\r\nstruggled vainly with the cords about his wrists. Even a detonite pistol\r\nwith its tiny grain of explosive in the end of each bullet would not\r\ncheck him--not when Walt and Diane were endangered. And the expression\r\non that heavy, scowling face had told him all too clearly that some real\r\ndanger threatened.\r\n\r\nBut the cords held fast on his swollen wrists. His head was still\r\nthrobbing; and even his side, not entirely healed, was adding to the\r\ntorment that beat upon him--beat and beat with his pulsing blood--until\r\nthe beating faded out into unconsciousness....\r\n\r\nDimly he knew they were soaring still higher as their radio picked up\r\nthe warning of an approaching patrol ship; vaguely, he realized that\r\nthey descended again to a level of observation. Chet knew in some corner\r\nof his brain that Schwartzmann was watching from an under lookout with a\r\npowerful glass, and he heard his excited command:\r\n\r\n\"Down--go slowly, down!... They are landing.... They have entered the\r\nhangar. Now, down with it. Max! Down! down!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe plunging fall of the ship roused Chet from his stupor. He felt the\r\njolt of the clumsy landing despite the snow-cushioned ground; he heard\r\nplainly the exclamations from beyond an open port--the startled oath in\r\nWalter Harkness' voice, and the stinging scorn in the words of Diane\r\nDelacouer.\r\n\r\nHerr Schwartzmann had been in the employ of Mademoiselle Delacouer, but\r\nhe was taking orders no longer. There was a sound of scuffling feet, and\r\nonce the thud of a blow.... Then Chet watched with heavy, hopeless eyes\r\nas the familiar faces of Diane and Walt appeared in the doorway. Their\r\nhands were bound; they, too, were threatened with a slim-barreled pistol\r\nin the hands of the smirking, exultant Schwartzmann.\r\n\r\nA tall, thin-faced man whom Chet had not seen before followed them into\r\nthe room. The newcomer was motioned forward now, as Schwartzmann called\r\nan order to the pilot:\r\n\r\n\"All right; now we go. Max! Herr Doktor Kreiss will give you the\r\nbearings; he knows his way among the stars.\"\r\n\r\nHerr Schwartzmann doubled over in laughing appreciation of his own\r\nsuccess before he straightened up and regarded his captives with cold\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Such a pleasure!\" he mocked; \"such charming passengers to take with me\r\non my first trip into space; this ship, it iss not so goot. I will build\r\nbetter ships later on; I will let you see them when I shall come to\r\nvisit you.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed again at sight of the wondering looks in the eyes of the\r\nthree; stooping, he jerked the gag from Chet's mouth.\r\n\r\n\"You do not understand,\" he exclaimed. \"I should haff explained. You\r\nsee, _meine guten Freunde_, we go--ach!--you have guessed it already! We\r\ngo to the Dark Moon. I am pleased to take you with me on the trip out;\r\nbut coming back, I will have so much to bring--there will be no room for\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\n\"I could have killed you here,\" he said; and his mockery gave place for\r\na moment to a savage tone, \"but the patrol ships, they are everywhere.\r\nBut I have influence here und there--I arranged that your flask of gas\r\nshould be charged with explosive, I discredited you, and yet I could not\r\nso great a risk take as to kill you all.\r\n\r\n\"So came inspiration! I called your foolish young friend here from the\r\nhospital. I ordered him to go at once to the ship hidden where I could\r\nnot find, and I signed the name of Herr Harkness.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet caught the silent glances of his friends who could yet smile\r\nhopefully through the other emotions that possessed them. He ground his\r\nteeth as the smooth voice of Herr Schwartzmann went on:\r\n\r\n\"He led me here: the young fool! Then I sent for you--und this time I\r\nsigned his name--und you came. So simple!\r\n\r\n\"Und now we go in _my_ ship to _my_ new world. And,\" he added savagely,\r\n\"if one of you makes the least trouble, he will land on the Dark\r\nMoon--yess!--but he will land hard, from ten thousand feet up!\"\r\n\r\nThe great generator was roaring. To Chet came the familiar lift of the\r\nR. A. effect. They were beyond the R. A.; they were heading out and away\r\nfrom Earth; and his friends were captives through his own unconscious\r\ntreachery, carried out into space in their own ship, with the hands of\r\nan enemy gripping the controls....\r\n\r\nChet's groan, as he turned his face away from the others who had tried\r\nto smile cheerfully, had nothing to do with the pain of his body. It was\r\nhis mind that was torturing him.\r\n\r\nBut he muttered broken words as he lay there, words that had reference\r\nto one Schwartzmann. \"I'll get him, damn him! I'll get him!\" he was\r\npromising himself.\r\n\r\nAnd Herr Schwartzmann, who was clever, would have proved his cleverness\r\nstill more by listening. For a Mister Pilot of the World does not get\r\nhis rating on vain boasts. He must know first his flying, his ships and\r\nhis air--but he is apt to make good in other ways as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_Out of Control_\r\n\r\n\r\nWalter Harkness had built this ship with Chet's help. They had designed\r\nit for space-travel. It was the first ship to leave the Earth under its\r\nown power, reach another heavenly body, and come back for a safe\r\nlanding. But they had not installed any luxuries for the passengers.\r\n\r\nIn the room where the three were confined, there were no\r\nself-compensating chairs such as the high-liners used. But the\r\nacceleration of the speeding ship was constant, and the rear wall became\r\ntheir floor where they sat or paced back and forth. Their bonds had been\r\nremoved, and one of Harkness' hands was gripping Diane's where they sat\r\nside by side. Chet was briskly limbering his cramped muscles.\r\n\r\nHe glanced at the two who sat silent nearby, and he knew what was in\r\ntheir minds--knew that each was thinking of the other, forgetting their\r\nown danger; and it was these two who had saved his life on their first\r\nadventure out in space.\r\n\r\nWalt--one man who was never spoiled by his millions; and Diane--straight\r\nand true as they make 'em! Some way, somehow, they must be saved--thus\r\nran his thoughts--but it looked bad for them all. Schwartzmann?--no use\r\nkidding themselves about that lad; he was one bad hombre. The best they\r\ncould hope for was to be marooned on the Dark Moon--left there to live\r\nor to die amid those savage surroundings; and the worst that might\r\nhappen--! But Chet refused to think of what alternatives might occur to\r\nthe ugly, distorted mind of the man who had them at his mercy.\r\n\r\nThere was no echo of these thoughts when he spoke; the smile that\r\nflashed across his lean face brought a brief response from the\r\ndespondent countenances of his companions.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" Chet observed, and ran his hand through a tangle of blond hair,\r\n\"I have heard that the Schwartzmann lines give service, and I reckon\r\nI heard right. Here we were wanting to go back to the Dark Moon,\r\nand,\"--he paused to point toward a black portlight where occasional\r\nlights flashed past--\"I'll say we're going; going somewhere at least.\r\nAll I hope is that that Maxie boy doesn't find the Dark Moon at about\r\nten thousand per. He may be a great little skipper on a nice, slow,\r\nfive-hundred-maximum freighter, but not on this boat. I don't like his\r\nlandings.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDiane Delacouer raised her eyes to smile approvingly upon him. \"You're\r\ngood, Chet,\" she said; \"you are a darn good sport. They knock you down\r\nout of control, and you nose right back up for a forty-thousand foot\r\nzoom. And you try to carry us with you. Well, I guess it's time we got\r\nover our gloom. Now what is going to happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you,\" said Walter Harkness, looking at his watch: \"if that\r\nfool pilot of Schwartzmann's doesn't cut his stern thrust and build up a\r\nbow resistance, we'll overshoot our mark and go tearing on a few hundred\r\nthousand miles in space.\"\r\n\r\nDiane was playing up to Chet's lead.\r\n\r\n\"_Bien!_\" she exclaimed. \"A few million, perhaps! Then we may see some\r\nof those Martians we've been speculating about. I hear they are\r\nhandsome, my Walter--much better looking than you. Maybe this is all for\r\nthe best after all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Say,\" Harkness protested, \"if you two idiots don't know enough to worry\r\nas you ought, I don't see any reason why I should do all the heavy\r\nworrying for the whole crowd. I guess you've got the right idea at that:\r\ntake what comes when it gets here--or when we get there.\"\r\n\r\nSmall wonder, thought Chet, that Herr Schwartzmann stared at them in\r\npuzzled bewilderment when he flung open the door, and took one long\r\nstride into the room. Stocky, heavy-muscled, he stood regarding them, a\r\nfrown of suspicion drawing his face into ugly lines. Plainly he was\r\ndisturbed by this laughing good-humor where he had expected misery and\r\nhopelessness and tears. He moved the muzzle of a detonite pistol back\r\nand forth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You haff been drinking!\" he stated at last. \"You are intoxicated--all\r\nof you!\" His eyes darted searching glances about the little room that\r\nwas too bare to hide any cause for inebriation.\r\n\r\nIt was Mam'selle Diane who answered him with an emphatic shake of her\r\ndark head; an engaging smile tugged at the corners of her lips. \"_Mais\r\nnon!_ my dear Herr Schwartzmann,\" she assured him; \"it is joy--just\r\nhappiness at again approaching our Moon--and in such good company, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fortunes of war, Schwartzmann,\" declared Harkness; \"we know how to\r\naccept them, and we don't hold it against you. We are down now, but your\r\nturn will come.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's reply was a sputtering of rage in words that neither Chet nor\r\nHarkness could understand. The latter turned to the girl with a\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n\"Did you get it, Diane? What did he say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I would not care to translate it literally,\" said Diane\r\nDelacouer, twisting her soft mouth into an expression of distaste; \"but,\r\nspeaking generally, he disagrees with you.\"\r\n\r\nHerr Schwartzmann was facing Harkness belligerently. \"You think you know\r\nsomething! What is it?\" he demanded. \"You are under my feet; I kick you\r\nas I would _meinen Hund_ and you can do nothing.\" He aimed a savage kick\r\ninto the air to illustrate his meaning, and Harkness' face flushed\r\nsuddenly scarlet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhatever retort was on Harkness' tongue was left unspoken; a sharp look\r\nfrom Chet, who brought his fingers swiftly to his lips in a gesture of\r\nsilence, checked the reply. The action was almost unconscious on Chet's\r\npart; it was as unpremeditated as the sudden thought that flashed\r\nabruptly into his mind--\r\n\r\nThey were helpless; they were in this brute's power beyond the slightest\r\ndoubt. Schwartzmann's words, \"You know something. What is it?\" had fired\r\na swift train of thought.\r\n\r\nThe idea was nebulous as yet ... but if they could throw a scare into\r\nthis man--make him think there was danger ahead.... Yes, that was it:\r\nmake Schwartzmann think they knew of dangers that he could not avoid.\r\nThey had been there before: make this man afraid to kill them. The\r\ndreadful alternative that Chet had feared to think of might be\r\naverted....\r\n\r\nAll this came in an instantaneous, flashing correlation of his conscious\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what we mean,\" he told Schwartzmann. He even leaned\r\nforward to shake an impressive finger before the other's startled face.\r\n\"I'll tell you first of all that it doesn't make a damn bit of\r\ndifference who is on top--or it won't in a few hours more. We'll all be\r\nwashed out together.\r\n\r\n\"I've landed once on the Dark Moon; I know what will happen. And do you\r\nknow how fast we are going? Do you know the Moon's speed as it\r\napproaches? Had you thought what you will look like when that fool pilot\r\nrams into it head on?\r\n\r\n\"And that isn't all!\" He grinned derisively into Schwartzmann's flushed\r\nface, disregarding the half-raised pistol; it was as if some secret\r\nthought had filled him with overpowering amusement. His broad grin grew\r\ninto a laugh. \"That isn't all, big boy. What will you do if you do land?\r\nWhat will you do when you open the ports and the--\" He cut his words\r\nshort, and the smile, with all other expression, was carefully erased\r\nfrom his young face.\r\n\r\n\"No, I reckon I won't spoil the surprise. We got through it all right;\r\nmaybe you will, too--maybe!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd again it was Diane who played up to Chet's lead without a moment's\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Chet,\" she demanded, \"aren't you going to warn him? You would not allow\r\nhim and his men to be--\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped in apparent horror of the unsaid words; Chet gave her an\r\napproving glance.\r\n\r\n\"We'll see about that when we get there, Diane.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned abruptly back to Schwartzmann, \"I'll forget what a rotten\r\nwinner you have been; I'll help you out: I'll take the controls if you\r\nlike. Of course, your man, Max, may set us down without damage; then\r\nagain--\"\r\n\r\n\"Take them!\" Schwartzmann ungraciously made an order of his acceptance.\r\n\"Take the controls, Herr Bullard! But if you make a single false move!\"\r\nThe menacing pistol completed the threat.\r\n\r\nBut \"Herr Bullard\" merely turned to his companion with a level,\r\nunderstanding look. \"Come on,\" he said; \"you can both help in working\r\nout our location.\"\r\n\r\nHe stepped before the burly man that Diane might precede them through\r\nthe door. And he felt the hand of Walt Harkness on his arm in a pressure\r\nthat told what could not be said aloud.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were pallid-faced men in the cabin through which they passed; men\r\nwho stared and stared from the window-ports into the black immensity of\r\nspace. Chet, too, stopped to look; there had been no port-holes in that\r\ninner room where they had been confined.\r\n\r\nHe knew what to expect; he knew how awe-inspiring would be the sight of\r\nstrange, luminous bodies--great islands of light--masses of\r\nanimalculae--that glowed suddenly, then melted again into velvet black.\r\nA whirl of violet grew almost golden in sudden motion; Chet knew it for\r\nan invisible monster of space. Glowingly luminous as it threw itself\r\nupon a subtle mass of shimmering light, it faded like a flickering flame\r\nand went dark as its motion ceased.\r\n\r\nLife!--life, everywhere in this ocean of space! And on every hand was\r\ndeath. \"Not surprising,\" Chet realized, \"that these other Earthmen are\r\nawed and trembling!\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was above them; its light struck squarely down through the upper\r\nports. This was polarized light--there was nothing outside to reflect or\r\nrefract it--and, coming as a straight beam from above, it made a\r\nbrilliant circle upon the floor from which it was diffused throughout\r\nthe room. It was as if the floor itself was the illuminating agent.\r\n\r\nNo eye could bear to look into the glare from above; nor was there need,\r\nfor the other ports drew the eyes with their black depths of unplumbed\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nBlack!--so velvet as to seem almost tangible! Could one have reached out\r\na hand, that blackness, it seemed, must be a curtain that the hand could\r\ndraw aside, where unflickering points of light pricked through the dark\r\nto give promise of some radiant glory beyond.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had seen it before, these three, yet Chet caught the eyes of\r\nHarkness and Diane and knew that his own eyes must share something of\r\nthe look he saw in theirs--something of reverent wonder and a strange\r\nhumility before this evidence of transcendent greatness.\r\n\r\nTheir own immediate problem seemed gone. The tyranny of this glowering\r\nhuman and his men--the efforts of the whole world and its struggling\r\nmillions--how absurdly unimportant it all was! How it faded to\r\ninsignificance! And yet....\r\n\r\nChet came from the reverie that held him. There was one man by whom this\r\nbeauty was unseen. Herr Schwartzmann was angrily ordering them on, and,\r\nsurprisingly, Chet laughed aloud.\r\n\r\nThis problem, he realized, was _his_ problem--his to solve with the help\r\nof the other two. And it was not insignificant; he knew with some sudden\r\nwordless knowledge that there was nothing in all the great scheme but\r\nthat it had its importance. This vastness that was beyond the power of\r\nhuman mind to grasp ceased to be formidable--he was part of it. He felt\r\nbuoyed up; and he led the way confidently toward the control-room door\r\nwhere Schwartzmann stood.\r\n\r\nThe scientist, whom Schwartzmann had called Herr Doktor Kreiss, was\r\nbeside the pilot. He was leaning forward to search the stars in the\r\nblackness ahead, but the pilot turned often to stare through the rear\r\nlookouts as if drawn in fearful fascination by what was there. Chet took\r\nthe controls at Schwartzmann's order; the pilot saluted with a trembling\r\nhand and vanished into the cabin at the rear.\r\n\r\n\"Ready for flying orders, Doctor,\" the new pilot told Herr Kreiss. \"I'll\r\nput her where you say--within reason.\"\r\n\r\nBehind him he heard the choked voice of Mademoiselle Diane: \"_Regardez!\r\nAh, mon Dieu_, the beauty of it! This loveliness--it hurts!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne hand was pressed to her throat; her face was turned as the pilot's\r\nhad been that she might stare and stare at a quite impossible moon--a\r\ngreat half-disk of light in the velvet dark.\r\n\r\n\"This loveliness--it hurts!\" Chet looked, too, and knew what Diane was\r\nfeeling. There was a catch of emotion in his own throat--a feeling that\r\nwas almost fear.\r\n\r\nA giant half-moon!--and he knew it was the Earth. Golden Earth-light\r\ncame to them in a flooding glory; the blazing sun struck on it from\r\nabove to bring out half the globe in brilliant gold that melted to\r\nsoftest, iridescent, rainbow tints about its edge. Below, hung\r\nmotionless in the night, was another sphere. Like a reflection of Earth\r\nin the depths of some Stygian lake, the old moon shone, too, in a\r\nhalf-circle of light.\r\n\r\nSmall wonder that these celestial glories brought a gasp of delight from\r\nDiane, or drew into lines of fear the face of that other pilot who saw\r\nonly his own world slipping away. But Chet Bullard, Master Pilot of the\r\nWorld, swung back to scan a star-chart that the scientist was holding,\r\nthen to search out a similar grouping in the black depths into which\r\nthey were plunging, and to bring the cross-hairs of a rigidly mounted\r\ntelescope upon that distant target.\r\n\r\n\"How far?\" he asked himself in a half-spoken thought, \"--how far have we\r\ncome?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was an instrument that ticked off the seconds in this seemingly\r\ntimeless void. He pressed a small lever beside it, and, beneath a glass\r\nthat magnified the readings, there passed the time-tape. Each hour and\r\nminute was there; each movement of the controls was indicated; each\r\ntrifling variation in the power of the generator's blast. Chet made some\r\ncareful computations and passed the paper to Harkness, who tilted the\r\ntime-tape recorder that he might see the record.\r\n\r\n\"Check this, will you, Walt?\" Chet was asking. \"It is based on the time\r\nof our other trip, acceleration assumed as one thousand miles per hour\r\nper hour out of air--\"\r\n\r\nThe scientist interrupted; he spoke in English that was carefully\r\nprecise.\r\n\r\n\"It should lie directly ahead--the Dark Moon. I have calculated with\r\nexactness.\"\r\n\r\nWalter Harkness had snatched up a pair of binoculars. He swung sharply\r\nfrom lookout to lookout while he searched the heavens.\r\n\r\n\"It's damned lucky for us that you made a slight error,\" Chet was\r\ntelling the other.\r\n\r\n\"Error?\" Kreiss challenged. \"Impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you and I are dead right this minute,\" Chet told him. \"We are\r\ncrossing the orbit of the Dark Moon--crossing at twenty thousand miles\r\nper hour relative to Earth, slightly in excess of that figure relative\r\nto the Dark Moon. If it had been here--!\" He had been watching Harkness\r\nanxiously; he bit off his words as the binoculars were thrust into his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n\"There she comes,\" Harkness told him quietly; \"it's up to you!\"\r\n\r\nBut Chet did not need the glasses. With his unaided eyes he could see a\r\nfaint circle of violet light. It lay ahead and slightly above, and it\r\ngrew visibly larger as he watched. A ring of nothingness, whose outline\r\nwas the faintest shimmering halo; more of the distant stars winked out\r\nswiftly behind that ghostly circle; it was the Dark Moon!--and it was\r\nrushing upon them!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet swung an instrument upon it. He picked out a jet of violet light\r\nthat could be distinguished, and he followed it with the cross-hairs\r\nwhile he twirled a micrometer screw; then he swiftly copied the reading\r\nthat the instrument had inscribed. The invisible disk with its ghostly\r\nedges of violet was perceptibly larger as he slammed over the\r\ncontrol-ball to up-end them in air.\r\n\r\nUnder the control-room's nitron illuminator the cheeks of Herr Doktor\r\nKreiss were pale and bloodless as if his heart had ceased to function.\r\nHarkness had moved quietly back to the side of Diane Delacouer and was\r\nholding her two hands firmly in his.\r\n\r\nThe very air seemed charged with the quick tenseness of emotions.\r\nSchwartzmann must have sensed it even before he saw the onrushing death.\r\nThen he leaped to a lookout, and, an instant later, sprang at Chet\r\ncalmly fingering the control.\r\n\r\n\"Fool!\" he screamed, \"you would kill us all? Turn away from it! Away\r\nfrom it!\"\r\n\r\nHe threw himself in a frenzy upon the pilot. The detonite pistol was\r\nstill in his hand. \"Quick!\" he shouted. \"Turn us!\"\r\n\r\nHarkness moved swiftly, but the scientist, Kreiss, was nearer; it was he\r\nwho smashed the gun-hand down with a quick blow and snatched at the\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann was beside himself with rage. \"You, too?\" he demanded.\r\n\"Giff it me--traitor!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the tall man stood uncompromisingly erect. \"Never,\" he said, \"have I\r\nseen a ship large enough to hold two commanding pilots. I take your\r\norders in all things, Herr Schwartzmann--all but this. If we die--we\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann sputtered: \"We should haff turned away. Even yet we might.\r\nIt will--it will--\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" agreed Kreiss, still in that precise, class-room voice,\r\n\"perhaps it will. But this I know: with an acceleration of one thousand\r\nm.p.h. per hour as this young man with the badge of a Master Pilot says,\r\nwe cannot hope, in the time remaining, to overcome our present velocity;\r\nwe can never check our speed and build up a relatively opposite motion\r\nbefore that globe would overwhelm us. If he has figured correctly, this\r\nyoung man--if he has found the true resultant of our two motions of\r\napproach--and if he has swung us that we may drive out on a line\r\nperpendicular to the resultant--\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I have,\" said Chet quietly. \"If I haven't, in just a few\r\nminutes it won't matter to any of us; it won't matter at all.\" He met\r\nthe gaze of Herr Doktor Kreiss who regarded him curiously.\r\n\r\n\"If we escape,\" the scientist told him, \"you will understand that I am\r\nunder Herr Schwartzmann's command; I will be compelled to shoot you if\r\nhe so orders. But, Herr Bullard, at this moment I would be very proud to\r\nshake your hand.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chet, as he extended his hand, managed a grin that was meant also\r\nfor the tense, white-faced Harkness and Diane. \"I like to see 'em dealt\r\nthat way,\" he said, \"--right off the top of the deck.\"\r\n\r\nBut the smile was erased as he turned back to the lookout. He had to\r\nlean close to see all of the disk, so swiftly was the approaching globe\r\nbearing down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt came now from the side; it swelled larger and larger before his eyes.\r\nTheir own ship seemed unmoving; only the unending thunder of the\r\ngenerator told of the frantic efforts to escape. They seemed hung in\r\nspace; their own terrific speed seemed gone--added to and fused with the\r\norbital motion of the Dark Moon to bring swiftly closer that messenger\r\nof death. The circle expanded silently; became menacingly huge.\r\n\r\nChet was whispering softly to himself: \"If I'd got hold of her an hour\r\nsooner--thirty minutes--or even ten.... We're doing over twenty thousand\r\nan hour combined speed, and we'll never really hit it.... We'll never\r\nreach the ground.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned this over in his mind, and he nodded gravely in confirmation\r\nof his own conclusions. It seemed somehow of tremendous importance that\r\nhe get this clearly thought out--this experience that was close ahead.\r\n\r\n\"Skin friction!\" he added. \"It will burn us up!\"\r\n\r\nHe has a sudden vision of a flaming star blazing a hot trail through the\r\natmosphere of this globe; there would be only savage eyes to follow\r\nit--to see the line of fire curving swiftly across the heavens.... He,\r\nhimself, was seeing that blazing meteor so plainly....\r\n\r\nHis eyes found the lookout; the globe was gone. They were close--close!\r\nOnly for the enveloping gas that made of this a dark moon, they would be\r\nseeing the surface, the outlines of continents.\r\n\r\nChet strained his eyes--to see nothing! It was horrible. It had been\r\nfearful enough to watch that expanding globe.... He was abruptly aware\r\nthat the outer rim of the lookout was red!\r\n\r\nFor Chet Bullard, time ceased to have meaning; what were seconds--or\r\ncenturies--as he stared at that glowing rim? He could not have told. The\r\nouter shell of their ship--it was radiant--shining red-hot in the night.\r\nAnd above the roar of the generator came a nerve-ripping shriek. A wind\r\nlike a blast from hell was battering and tearing at their ship.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by!\" He has tried to call; the demoniac shrieking from without\r\nsmothered his voice. One arm was across his eyes in an unconscious\r\nmotion. The air of the little room was stifling. He forced his arm down;\r\nhe would meet death face to face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe lookout was ringed with fire; it was white with the terrible white\r\nof burning steel!--it was golden!--then cherry red! It was dying, as the\r\nfire dies from glowing metal plunged in its tempering bath--or thrown\r\ninto the cold reaches of space!\r\n\r\nIn Chet's ears was the roar of a detonite motor. He tried to realize\r\nthat the lookouts were rimmed with black--cold, fireless black! An\r\nincredible black! There were stars there like pinpoints of flame! But\r\nconviction came only when he saw from a lookout in another wall a circle\r\nof violet that shrank and dwindled as he watched....\r\n\r\nA hand was gripping his shoulder; he heard the voice of Walter Harkness\r\nspeaking, while Walt's hand crept to raise the triple star that was\r\npinned to his blouse.\r\n\r\n\"Master Pilot of the World!\" Harkness was saying. \"That doesn't cover\r\nenough territory, old man. It's another rating that you're entitled to,\r\nbut I'm damned if I know what it is.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, for once, Chet's ready smile refused to form. He stared dumbly at\r\nhis friend; his eyes passed to the white face of Mademoiselle Diane;\r\nthen back to the controls, where his hand, without conscious volition,\r\nwas reaching to move a metal ball.\r\n\r\n\"Missed it!\" he assured himself. \"Hit the fringe of the air--just the\r\nvery outside. If we'd been twenty thousand feet nearer!... He was moving\r\nthe ball: their bow was swinging. He steadied it and set the ship on an\r\napproximate course.\r\n\r\n\"A stern chase!\" he said aloud. \"All our momentum to be overcome--but\r\nit's easy sailing now!\"\r\n\r\nHe pushed the ball forward to the limit, and the explosion-motor gave\r\nthunderous response.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_The Return to the Dark Moon_\r\n\r\n\r\nNo man faces death in so shocking a form without feeling the effects.\r\nDeath had flicked them with a finger of flame and had passed them by.\r\nChet Bullard found his hands trembling uncontrollably as he fumbled for\r\na book and opened it. The tables of figures printed there were blurred\r\nat first to his eyes, but he forced himself to forget the threat that\r\nwas past, for there was another menace to consider now.\r\n\r\nAnd uppermost in his mind, when his thoughts came back into some\r\napproximate order, was condemnation of himself for an opportunity that\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\n\"I could have jumped him,\" he told himself with bitter self-reproach; \"I\r\ncould have grabbed the pistol from Kreiss--the man was petrified.\" And\r\nthen Chet had to admit a fact there was no use of denying: \"I was as\r\nparalyzed as he was,\" he said, and only knew he had spoken aloud when he\r\nsaw the puzzled look that crossed Harkness' face.\r\n\r\nHarkness and Diane had drawn near. In a far corner of the little room\r\nSchwartzmann had motioned to Kreiss to join him; they were as far away\r\nfrom the others as could be managed. Schwartzmann, Chet judged, needed\r\nsome scientific explanation of these disturbing events; also he needed\r\nto take the detonite pistol from Kreiss' hand and jam it into his own\r\nhand. His eyes, at Chet's unconscious exclamation, had come with instant\r\nsuspicion toward the two men.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-seven hours, Walt,\" the pilot said, and repeated it loudly for\r\nSchwartzmann's benefit; \"--forty-seven hours before we return to this\r\nspot. We are driving out into space; we've crossed the orbit of the Dark\r\nMoon, and we're doing twenty thousand miles an hour.\r\n\r\n\"Now we must decelerate. It will take twenty hours to check us to zero\r\nspeed; then twenty-seven more to shoot us back to this same point in\r\nspace, allowing, of course, for a second deceleration. The same figuring\r\nwith only slight variation will cover a return to the Dark Moon. As we\r\nsweep out I can allow for the moon-motion, and we'll hit it at a safe\r\nlanding speed on the return trip this time.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet was paying little attention to his companion as he spoke. His eyes,\r\ninstead, were covertly watching the bulky figure of Schwartzmann. As he\r\nfinished, their captor shot a volley of questions at the scientist\r\nbeside him; he was checking up on the pilot's remarks.\r\n\r\nChet was leaning forward to stare intently from a lookout, his head was\r\nclose to that of Harkness.\r\n\r\n\"Listen, Walt,\" he whispered; \"the Moon's out of sight; it's easy to\r\nlose. Maybe I can't find it again, anyway--it's going to take some nice\r\nnavigating--but I'll miss it by ten thousand miles if you say so, and\r\neven the Herr Doktor can't check me on it.\"\r\n\r\nChet saw the eyes of Schwartzmann grow intent. He reached ostentatiously\r\nfor another book of tables, and he seated himself that he might figure\r\nin comfort.\r\n\r\n\"Just check me on this,\" he told Harkness.\r\n\r\nHe put down meaningless figures, while the man beside him remained\r\nsilent. Over and over he wrote them--would Harkness never reach a\r\ndecision?--over and over, until--\r\n\r\n\"I don't agree with that,\" Harkness told him and reached for the stylus\r\nin Chet's hand. And, while he appeared to make his own swift\r\ncomputations, there were words instead of figures that flowed from his\r\npen.\r\n\r\n\"Only alternative: return to Earth,\" he wrote. \"Then S will hold off;\r\nwait in upper levels. Kreiss will give him new bearings. We'll shoot out\r\nagain and do it better next time. Kreiss is nobody's fool. S means to\r\nmaroon us on Moon--kill us perhaps. He'll get us there, sure. We might\r\nas well go now.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet had seen a movement across the room. \"Let's start all over again,\"\r\nhe broke in abruptly. He covered the writing with a clean sheet of paper\r\nwhere he set down more figures. He was well under way when\r\nSchwartzmann's quick strides brought him towering above them. Again the\r\ndetonite pistol was in evidence; its small black muzzle moved steadily\r\nfrom Harkness to Chet.\r\n\r\n\"For your life--such as is left of it--you may thank Herr Doktor\r\nKreiss,\" he told Chet. \"I thought at first you would have attempted to\r\nkill us.\" His smile, as he regarded them, seemed to Chet to be entirely\r\nevil. \"You were near death twice, my dear Herr Bullard; and the danger\r\nis not entirely removed.\r\n\r\n\"'Forty-seven hours' you have said; in forty-seven hours you will land\r\nus on the Dark Moon. If you do not,\"--he raised the pistol\r\nsuggestively--\"remember that the pilot, Max, can always take us back to\r\nEarth. You are not indispensable.\"\r\n\r\nChet looked at the dark face and its determined and ominous scowl.\r\n\"You're a cheerful sort of soul, aren't you?\" he demanded. \"Do you have\r\nany faint idea of what a job this is? Do you know we will shoot another\r\ntwo hundred thousand miles straight out before I can check this ship?\r\nThen we come back; and meanwhile the Dark Moon has gone on its way. Had\r\nyou thought that there's a lot of room to get lost in out here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty-seven hours!\" said Schwartzmann. \"I would advise that you do not\r\nlose your way.\"\r\n\r\nChet shot one quizzical glance at Harkness.\r\n\r\n\"That,\" he said, \"makes it practically unanimous.\"\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann, with an elaborate show of courtesy, escorted Diane\r\nDelacouer to a cabin where she might rest. At a questioning look between\r\nDiane and Harkness, their captor reassured them.\r\n\r\n\"Mam'selle shall be entirely safe,\" he said. \"She may join you here\r\nwhenever she wishes. As for you,\"--he was speaking to Harkness--\"I will\r\npermit you to stay here. I could tie you up but this iss not necessary.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Harkness must have agreed that it was indeed unnecessary, for either\r\nKreiss or Max, or some other of Schwartzmann's men, was at his side\r\ncontinuously from that moment on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet would have liked a chance for a quiet talk and an exchange of\r\nideas. It seemed that somewhere, somehow, he should be able to find an\r\nanswer to their problem. He stared moodily out into the blackness ahead,\r\nwhere a distant star was seemingly their goal. Harkness stood at his\r\nside or paced back and forth in the little room, until he threw himself,\r\nat last, upon a cot.\r\n\r\nAnd always the great stern-blast roared; muffled by the insulated walls,\r\nits unceasing thunder came at last to be unheard. To the pilot there was\r\nneither sound nor motion. His directional sights were unswervingly upon\r\nthat distant star ahead. Seemingly they were suspended, helpless and\r\ninert, in a black void. But for the occasional glowing masses of strange\r\nliving substance that flashed past in this ocean of space, he must\r\nalmost have believed they were motionless--a dead ship in a dead, black\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nBut the luminous things flashed and were gone--and their coming,\r\nstrangely, was from astern; they flicked past and vanished up ahead.\r\nAnd, by this, Chet knew that their tremendous momentum was unchecked.\r\nThough he was using the great stern blast to slow the ship, it was\r\ndriving stern-first into outer space. Nor, for twenty hours, was there a\r\nchange, more than a slackening of the breathless speed with which the\r\nlights went past.\r\n\r\nTwenty hours--and then Chet knew that they were in all truth hung\r\nmotionless, and he prayed that his figures that told him this were\r\ncorrect.... More timeless minutes, an agony of waiting--and a\r\ndimly-glowing mass that was ahead approached their bow, swung off and\r\nvanished far astern. And, with its going, Chet knew that the return trip\r\nwas begun.\r\n\r\nHe gave Harkness the celestial bearing marks and relinquished the helm.\r\n\"Full speed ahead as you are,\" he ordered; \"then at nineteen-forty on\r\nW.S. time, we'll cut it and ease on bow repulsion to the limit.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, despite the strangeness of their surroundings, the ceaseless,\r\nmurmuring roar of the exhaust, the weird world outside, where endless\r\nspace was waiting for man's exploration--despite the deadly menace that\r\nthreatened, Chet dropped his head upon his outflung arms and slept.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo his sleep-drugged brain it was scarcely a moment until a hand was\r\ndragging at his shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-seven hours!\" the voice of Schwartzmann was saying.\r\n\r\nAnd: \"Some navigating!\" Harkness was exclaiming in flattering amazement.\r\n\"Wake up, Chet! Wake up! The Dark Moon's in sight. You've hit it on the\r\nnose, old man: she isn't three points off the sights!\"\r\n\r\nThe bow-blast was roaring full on. Ahead of them Chet's sleepy eyes\r\nfound a circle of violet; and he rubbed his eyes savagely that he might\r\ntake his bearings on Sun and Earth.\r\n\r\nAs it had been before, the Earth was a giant half-moon; like a\r\nmirror-sphere it shot to them across the vast distance the reflected\r\nglory of the sun. But the globe ahead was a ghostly world. Its black\r\ndisk was lost in the utter blackness of space. It was a circle, marked\r\nonly by the absence of star-points and by the halo of violet glow that\r\nedged it about.\r\n\r\nChet cut down the repelling blast. He let the circle enlarge, then swung\r\nthe ship end for end in mid-space that the more powerful stern exhaust\r\nmight be ready to counteract the gravitational pull of the new world.\r\n\r\nAgain those impalpable clouds surrounded them. Here was the enveloping\r\ngas that made this a dark moon--the gas, if Harkness' theory was\r\ncorrect, that let the sun's rays pass unaltered; that took the light\r\nthrough freely to illumine this globe, but that barred its return\r\npassage as reflected light.\r\n\r\nBlack--dead black was the void into which they were plunging, until the\r\ndarkness gave way before a gentle glow that enfolded their ship. The\r\ngolden light enveloped them in growing splendor. Through every lookout\r\nit was flooding the cabin with brilliant rays, until, from below them,\r\ndirectly astern of the ship, where the thundering blast checked their\r\nspeed of descent, emerged a world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd, to Chet Bullard, softly fingering the controls of the first ship of\r\nspace--to Chet Bullard, whose uncanny skill had brought the tiny speck\r\nthat was their ship safely back from the dark recesses of the\r\nunknown--there came a thrill that transcended any joy of the first\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\nHere was water in great seas of unreal hue--and those seas were his!\r\nVast continents, ripe for adventure and heavy with treasure--and they,\r\ntoo, were his! His own world--his and Diane's and Walt's! Who was this\r\nman, Schwartzmann, that dared dream of violating their possessions?\r\n\r\nA slender tube pressed firmly, uncompromisingly, into his back to give\r\nthe answer to his question. \"Almost I wish you had missed it!\" Herr\r\nSchwartzmann was saying. \"But now you will land; you will set us down in\r\nsome place that you know. No tricks, Herr Bullard! You are clever, but\r\nnot clever enough for that. We will land, yess, where you know it is\r\nsafe.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the lookout, the man stared for a moment with greedy eyes; then\r\nbrought his gaze back to the three. His men, beside Harkness and Diane,\r\nwere alert; the scientist, Kreiss, stood close to Chet.\r\n\r\n\"A nice little world,\" Schwartzmann told them. \"Herr Harkness, you have\r\nfiled claims on it; who am I to dispute with the great Herr Harkness?\r\nWithout question it iss yours!\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed loudly, while his eyes narrowed between creasing wrinkles of\r\nflesh. \"You shall enjoy it,\" he told them; \"--all your life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chet, as he caught the gaze of Harkness and Diane, wondered how long\r\nthis enjoyment would last. \"All your life!\" But this was rather\r\nindefinite as a measure of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_A Desperate Act_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ship that Chet Bullard and Harkness had designed had none of the\r\ninstruments for space navigation that the ensuing years were to bring.\r\nChet's accuracy was more the result of that flyer's sixth sense--that\r\nsame uncanny power that had served aviators so well in an earlier day.\r\nBut Chet was glad to see his instruments registering once more as he\r\napproached a new world.\r\n\r\nEven the sonoflector was recording; its invisible rays were darting\r\ndownward to be reflected back again from the surface below. That\r\nabsolute altitude recording was a joy to read; it meant a definite\r\nrelationship with the world.\r\n\r\n\"I'll hold her at fifty thousand,\" he told Harkness. \"Watch for some\r\noutline that you can remember from last time.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an irregular area of continental size; only when they had\r\ncrossed it did Harkness point toward an outflung projection of land.\r\n\"That peninsula,\" he exclaimed; \"we saw that before! Swing south and\r\ninland.... Now down forty, and east of south.... This ought to be the\r\nspot.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps Harkness, too, had the flyer's indefinable power of orientation.\r\nHe guided Chet in the downward flight, and his pointing finger aimed at\r\nlast at a cluster of shadows where a setting sun brought mountain ranges\r\ninto strong relief. Chet held the ship steady, hung high in the air,\r\nwhile the quick-spreading mantle of night swept across the world below.\r\nAnd, at last, when the little world was deep-buried in shadow, they saw\r\nthe red glow of fires from a hidden valley in the south.\r\n\r\n\"Fire Valley!\" said Chet, \"Don't say anything about me being a\r\nnavigator. Wait, you've brought us home, sure enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Home!\" He could not overcome this strange excitement of a homecoming to\r\ntheir own world. Even the man who stood, pistol in hand, behind him was,\r\nfor the moment, forgotten.\r\n\r\nValley of a thousand fires!--scene of his former adventures! Each\r\nfumerole was adding its smoky red to the fiery glow that illumined the\r\nplace. There were ragged mountains hemming it in; Chet's gaze passed on\r\nto the valley's end.\r\n\r\nDown there, where the fires ceased, there would be water; he would land\r\nthere! And the ship from Earth slipped down in a long slanting line to\r\ncushion against its under exhausts, whose soft thunder echoed back from\r\na bare expanse of frozen lava. Then its roaring faded. The silvery shape\r\nsank softly to its rocky bed as Chet cut the motor that had sung its\r\nsong of power since the moment when Schwartzmann had carried him\r\noff--taken him from that frozen, forgotten corner of an incredibly\r\ndistant Earth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Iss there air?\" Schwartzmann demanded. Chet came to himself again with\r\na start: he saw the man peering from the lookout to right and to left as\r\nif he would see all that there was in the last light of day.\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" he was grumbling to himself. \"A strange place! But those\r\nhills--I saw their markings--there will be metals there. I will explore;\r\nlater I return: I will mine them. Many ships I must build to establish a\r\nline. The first transportation line of space. Me, Jacob Schwartzmann--I\r\nwill do it. I will haff more than anyone else on Earth; I will make them\r\nall come to me crawling on their bellies!\"\r\n\r\nChet saw the hard shine of the narrowed eyes. For an instant only, he\r\ndared to consider the chance of leaping upon the big, gloating figure.\r\nOne blow and a quick snatch for the pistol!... Then he knew the folly of\r\nsuch a plan: Schwartzmann's men were armed; he would be downed in\r\nanother second, his body a shattered, jellied mass.\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann's thoughts had come back to the matter of air; he motioned\r\nChet and Harkness toward the port.\r\n\r\nDiane Delacouer had joined them and she thrust herself quickly between\r\nthe two men. And, though Schwartzmann made a movement as if he would\r\nsnatch her back, he thought better of it and motioned for the portal to\r\nbe swung. Chet felt him close behind as he followed the others out into\r\nthe gathering dark.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe air was heavy with the fragrance of night-blooming trees. They were\r\nclose to the edge of the lava flow. The rock was black in the light of a\r\nstarry sky; it dropped away abruptly to a lower glade. A stream made\r\nsilvery sparklings in the night, while beyond it were waving shadows of\r\nstrange trees whose trunks were ghostly white.\r\n\r\nIt was all so familiar.... Chet smiled understandingly as he saw Walt\r\nHarkness' arm go about the trim figure of Diane Delacouer. No mannish\r\nattire could disguise Diane's charms; nor could nerve and cold courage\r\nthat any man might envy detract from her femininity. Her dark, curling\r\nhair was blowing back from her upraised face as the scented breezes\r\nplayed about her; and the soft beauty of that face was enhanced by the\r\nvery starlight that revealed it.\r\n\r\nIt was here that Walt and Diane had learned to love; what wonder that\r\nthe fragrant night brought only remembrance, and forgetfulness of their\r\npresent plight. But Chet Bullard, while he saw them and smiled in\r\nsympathy, knew suddenly that other eyes were watching, too; he felt the\r\nbulky figure of Herr Schwartzmann beside him grow tense and rigid.\r\n\r\nBut Schwartzmann's voice, when he spoke, was controlled. \"All right,\" he\r\ncalled toward the ship; \"all iss safe.\"\r\n\r\nYet Chet wondered at that sudden tensing, and an uneasy presentiment\r\nfound entrance to his thoughts. He must keep an eye on Schwartzmann,\r\neven more than he had supposed.\r\n\r\nTheir captor had threatened to maroon them on the Dark Moon. Chet did\r\nnot question his intent. Schwartzmann would have nothing to gain by\r\nkilling them now. It would be better to leave them here, for he might\r\nfind them useful later on. But did he plan to leave them all or only\r\ntwo? Behind the steady, expressionless eyes of the Master Pilot, strange\r\nthoughts were passing....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were orders, at length, to return to the ship. \"It is dark\r\nalready,\" Schwartzmann concluded; \"nothing can be accomplished at night.\r\n\r\n\"How long are the days and nights?\" he asked Harkness.\r\n\r\n\"Six hours.\" Harkness told him; \"our little world spins fast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then for six hours we sleep,\" was the order. And again Herr\r\nSchwartzmann conducted Mademoiselle Delacouer to her cabin, while Chet\r\nBullard watched until he saw the man depart and heard the click of the\r\nlock on the door of Diane's room.\r\n\r\nThen for six hours he listened to the sounds of sleeping men who were\r\nsprawled about him on the floor; for six hours he saw the one man who\r\nsat on guard beside a light that made any thought of attack absurd. And\r\nhe cursed himself for a fool, as he lay wakeful and vainly planning--a\r\npoor, futile fool who was unable to cope with this man who had bested\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nNineteen seventy-three!--and here were Harkness and Diane and himself,\r\ncaptured by a man who was mentally and morally a misfit in a modern\r\nworld. A throw-back--that was Schwartzmann: Harkness had said it. He\r\nbelonged back in nineteen fourteen.\r\n\r\nHarkness was beyond the watching guard; from where he lay came sounds of\r\nrestless movement. Chet knew that he was not alone in this mood of\r\nhopeless dejection. There was no opportunity for talk; only with the\r\ncoming of day did the two find a chance to exchange a few quick words.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe guard roused the others at the first sight of sunlight beyond the\r\nports. Harkness sauntered slowly to where Chet was staring from a\r\nlookout. He, too, leaned to see the world outside, and he spoke\r\ncautiously in a half-whisper:\r\n\r\n\"Not a chance, Chet. No use trying to bluff this big crook any more.\r\nHe's here, and he's safe; and he knows it as well as we do. We'll let\r\nhim ditch us--you and Diane and me. Then, when we're on our own, we'll\r\nwatch our chance. He will go crazy with what he finds--may get\r\ncareless--then we'll seize the ship--\" His words ended abruptly. As\r\nSchwartzmann came behind them, he was casually calling Chet's attention\r\nto a fumerole from which a jet of vapor had appeared. Yellowish, it was;\r\nand the wind was blowing it.\r\n\r\nChet turned away; he hardly saw Schwartzmann or heard Harkness' words.\r\nHe was thinking of what Walt had said. Yes, it was all they could do;\r\nthere was no chance of a fight with them now. But later!\r\n\r\nDiane Delacouer came into the control-room at the instant; her dark eyes\r\nwere still lovely with sleep, but they brightened to flash an\r\nencouraging smile toward the two men. There were five of Schwartzmann's\r\nmen in the ship besides the pilot and the scientist, Kreiss. They all\r\ncrowded in after Diane.\r\n\r\nThey must have had their orders in advance; Schwartzmann merely nodded,\r\nand they sprang upon Harkness and Chet. The two were caught off their\r\nguard; their arms were twisted behind them before resistance could be\r\nthought of. Diane gave a cry, started forward, and was brushed back by a\r\nsweep of Schwartzmann's arm. The man himself stood staring at them,\r\nunmoving, wordless. Only the flesh about his eyes gathered into creases\r\nto squeeze the eyes to malignant slits. There was no mistaking the\r\nmenace in that look.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I think we do not need you any more,\" he said at last. \"I think, Herr\r\nHarkness, this is the end of our little argument--and, Herr Harkness,\r\nyou lose. Now, I will tell you how it iss that you pay.\r\n\r\n\"You haff thought, perhaps, I would kill you. But you were wrong, as you\r\nmany times have been. You haff not appreciated my kindness; you haff not\r\nunderstood that mine iss a heart of gold.\r\n\r\n\"Even I was not sure before we came what it iss best to do. But now I\r\nknow. I saw oceans and many lands on this world. I saw islands in those\r\noceans.\r\n\r\n\"You so clever are--such a great thinker iss Herr Harkness--and on one\r\nof those islands you will haff plenty of time to think--yess! You can\r\nthink of your goot friend, Schwartzmann, and of his kindness to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are going to maroon us on an island?\" asked Walt Harkness hoarsely.\r\nPlainly his plans for seizing the ship were going awry. \"You are going\r\nto put the three of us off in some lost corner of this world?\"\r\n\r\nChet Bullard was silent until he saw the figure of Harkness struggling\r\nto throw off his two guards. \"Walt,\" he called loudly, \"take it easy!\r\nFor God's sake, Walt, keep your head!\"\r\n\r\nThis, Chet sensed, was no time for resistance. Let Schwartzmann go ahead\r\nwith his plans; let him think them complacent and unresisting; let Max\r\npilot the ship; then watch for an opening when they could land a blow\r\nthat would count! He heard Schwartzmann laughing now, laughing as if he\r\nwere enjoying something more pleasing than the struggles of Walt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet was standing by the controls. The metal instrument-table was beside\r\nhim; above it was the control itself, a metal ball that hung suspended\r\nin air within a cage of curved bars.\r\n\r\nIt was pure magic, this ball-control, where magnetic fields crossed and\r\nrecrossed; it was as if the one who held it were a genie who could throw\r\nthe ship itself where he willed. Glass almost enclosed the cage of bars,\r\nand the whole instrument swung with the self-compensating platform that\r\nadjusted itself to the \"gravitation\" of accelerated speed. The pilot,\r\nMax, had moved across to the instrument-table, ready for the take-off.\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann's laughter died to a gurgling chuckle. He wiped his eyes\r\nbefore he replied to Harkness' question.\r\n\r\n\"Leave you,\" he said, \"in one place? _Nein!_ One here, the other there.\r\nA thousand miles apart, it might be. And not all three of you. That\r\nwould be so unkind--\"\r\n\r\nHe interrupted himself to call to Kreiss who was opening the port.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he ordered: \"keep it closed. We are not going outside; we are\r\ngoing up.\"\r\n\r\nBut Kreiss had the port open. \"I want a man to get some fresh water,\" he\r\nsaid; \"he will only be a minute.\"\r\n\r\nHe shoved at a waiting man to hurry him through the doorway. It was only\r\na gentle push: Chet wondered as he saw the man stagger and grasp at his\r\nthroat. He was coughing--choking horribly for an instant outside the\r\nopen port--then fell to the ground, while his legs jerked awkwardly,\r\nspasmodically.\r\n\r\nChet saw Kreiss follow. The scientist would have leaped to the side of\r\nthe stricken man, whose body was so still now on the sunlit rock; but\r\nhe, too, crumpled, then staggered back into the room. He pushed feebly\r\nat the port and swung it shut. His face, as he turned, was drawn into\r\nfearful lines.\r\n\r\n\"Acid!\" He choked out the words between strangled breaths.\r\n\"Acid--sulfuric--fumes!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet turned quickly to the spectro-analyzer: the lines of oxygen and\r\nnitrogen were merged with others, and that meant an atmosphere unfit for\r\nhuman lungs! There had been a fumerole where yellowish vapor was\r\nspouting: he remembered it now.\r\n\r\n\"So!\" boomed Schwartzmann, and now his squinting eyes were full on Chet.\r\n\"You--you _schwein_! You said when we opened the ports there would be a\r\nsurprise! Und this iss it! You thought to see us kill ourselves!\r\n\r\n\"Open that port!\" he shouted. The men who held Chet released him and\r\nsprang forward to obey. The pilot, Max, took their place. He put one\r\nhand on Chet's shoulder, while his other hand brought up a threatening\r\nmetal bar.\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann's heavy face had lost its stolid look; it was alive with\r\nrage. He thrust his head forward to glare at the men, while he stood\r\nfirmly, his feet far apart, two heavy fists on his hips. He whirled\r\nabruptly and caught Diane by one arm. He pulled her roughly to him and\r\nencircled the girl's trim figure with one huge arm.\r\n\r\n\"Put you _all_ on one island?\" he shouted. \"Did you think I would put\r\nyou _all_ out of the ship? You\"--he pointed at Harkness--\"and you\"--this\r\ntime it was Chet--\"go out now. You can die in your damned gas that you\r\nexpected would kill me! But, you fools, you imbeciles--Mam'selle, she\r\nstays with me!\" The struggling girl was helpless in the great arm that\r\ndrew her close.\r\n\r\nHarkness' mad rage gave place to a dead stillness. From bloodless lips\r\nin a chalk-white face he spat out one sentence:\r\n\r\n\"Take your filthy hands off her--now--or I'll--\"\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann's one free hand still held the pistol. He raised it with\r\ndeadly deliberation; it came level with Harkness' unflinching eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said Schwartzmann, \"You will do--what?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet saw the deadly tableau. He knew with a conviction that gripped his\r\nheart that here was the end. Walt would die and he would be next. Diane\r\nwould be left defenseless.... The flashing thought that followed came to\r\nhim as sharply as the crack of any pistol. It seemed to burst inside his\r\nbrain, to lift him with some dynamic power of its own and project him\r\ninto action.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself sideways from under the pilot's hand, out from beneath\r\nthe heavy metal bar--and he whirled, as he leaped, to face the man. One\r\nlean, brown hand clenched to a fist that started a long swing from\r\nsomewhere near his knees; it shot upward to crash beneath the pilot's\r\noutthrust jaw and lift him from the floor. Max had aimed the bar in a\r\ndownward sweep where Chet's head had been the moment before; and now man\r\nand bar went down together. In the same instant Chet threw himself upon\r\nthe weapon and leaped backward to his feet.\r\n\r\nOne frozen second, while, to Chet, the figures seemed as motionless as\r\nif carved from stone--two men beside the half-opened port--Harkness in\r\nconvulsive writhing between two others--the figure of Diane, strained,\r\ntense and helpless in Schwartzmann's grasp--and Schwartzmann, whose aim\r\nhad been disturbed, steadying the pistol deliberately upon Harkness--\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" Chet's voice tore through the confusion. He knew he must grip\r\nSchwartzmann's attention--hold that trigger finger that was tensed to\r\nsend a detonite bullet on its way. \"Wait, damn you! I'll answer your\r\nquestion. I'll tell you what we'll do!\"\r\n\r\nIn that second he had swung the metal bar high; now he brought it\r\ncrashing down in front of him. Schwartzmann flinched, half turned as if\r\nto fire at Chet, and saw the blow was not for him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith a splintering crash, the bar went through an obstruction. There was\r\nsound of glass that slivered to a million mangled bits--the sharp tang\r\nof metal broken off--a crash and clatter--then silence, save for one bit\r\nof glass that fell belatedly to the floor, its tiny jingling crash\r\nringing loud in the deathly stillness of the room....\r\n\r\nIt had been the control-room, this place of metal walls and of shining,\r\npolished instruments, and it could be called that no longer. For,\r\nbattered to useless wreckage, there lay on a metal table a cage that had\r\nonce been formed of curving bars. Among the fragments a metal ball that\r\nhad guided the great ship still rocked idly from its fall, until it,\r\ntoo, was still.\r\n\r\nIt was a room where nothing moved--where no person so much as\r\nbreathed....\r\n\r\nThen came the Master Pilot's voice, and it was speaking with quiet\r\nfinality.\r\n\r\n\"And that,\" he said, \"is your answer. Our ship has made its last\r\nflight.\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes held steadily upon the blanched face of Herr Schwartzmann,\r\nwhose limp arms released the body of Diane; the pistol hung weakly at\r\nthe man's side. And the pilot's voice went on, so quiet, so hushed--so\r\ncuriously toneless in that silent room.\r\n\r\n\"What was it that you said?--that Harkness and I would be staying here?\r\nWell, you were right when you said that, Schwartzmann: but it's a hard\r\nsentence, that--imprisonment for life.\"\r\n\r\nChet paused now, to smile deliberately, grimly at the dark face so\r\nbleached and bloodless, before he repeated:\r\n\r\n\"Imprisonment for life!--and you didn't know that you were sentencing\r\nyourself. For you're staying too, Schwartzmann, you contemptible,\r\nthieving dog! You're staying with us--here--on the Dark Moon!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\"_Six to Four_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps to every person in that control room there came, as Chet's\r\nquiet, emotionless tones died away, the same mental picture; for there\r\nwas the same dazed look on the countenances of all.\r\n\r\nThey were seeing an ocean of space, an endless void of empty black. And\r\nacross that etheric sea was a whirling globe. They had seen it from\r\nafar; they had seen its diminutive continents and its snow-clad\r\npoles.... They would never see it again....\r\n\r\nEarth!--their own world!--home! And now for them it was only a moon, a\r\ntremendous, glorious moon, whose apparent nearness would be taunting and\r\ncalling them each day and night of their lives....\r\n\r\nIt was Diane Delacouer who dared to break the hard silence that bound\r\nthem all. From wide eyes she stared at Walt Harkness; then her lips\r\nformed a trembling smile in which Chet, too, was included.\r\n\r\n\"You saved us,\" she whispered; \"you saved us, Chet ... but now it looks\r\nas if we all were exiles.\"\r\n\r\nShe crossed slowly, walking like one in a dream, to stand close to Walt\r\nHarkness. And Chet Bullard also roused himself; but it was toward the\r\nstupefied, hulking figure of Schwartzmann that he moved.\r\n\r\nHe reached for the detonite pistol, and this man who had been their\r\ncaptor was too stunned to make any resistance. Chet jammed the weapon\r\nunder his belt.\r\n\r\n\"Close that port!\" he ordered the two men who had half-opened it at\r\nSchwartzmann's command. \"Keep that poison gas out.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a flash of color that swept by the open port--some flying\r\ncreature of vivid crimson: Chet had no time to see what manner of bird\r\nor beast it was. But it was alive! He crossed to examine the\r\nspectro-analyzer, and the two men disregarded his order and slipped into\r\nthe rear cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Seems all clear to me, Walt,\" he said; and Harkness confirmed his\r\nfindings with a quick glance.\r\n\r\n\"O.K.!\" he assured Chet; \"that air is all right to breathe.\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced from a lookout port. \"The air's moving now,\" he said. \"That\r\ngas--whatever it was--is gone; it must have settled down here in the\r\nnight. Some new vent that has opened since we were here before.\r\n\r\n\"But suppose we forget that and settle matters in here,\" he suggested;\r\nand Chet nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\"Call your men!\" Harkness ordered Schwartzmann.\r\n\r\nThe man had recovered his composure; again his heavy face was flushed\r\nbeneath a stubble of beard. He made no move to comply with Harkness'\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nBut there was no need: from the cabin at the rear came the scientist,\r\nKreiss. His face was pale and drawn, and he stared long and searchingly\r\nat Chet Bullard. His breath still whistled in his throat; the poison gas\r\nhad nearly done for him.\r\n\r\nAt his heels were the two who had been working at the port. Two others,\r\nwho had held Harkness, were drawn off at one side, where they mumbled\r\none to another and shot ugly glances toward Chet.\r\n\r\nThis, Chet knew, accounted for all. Even the pilot, Max, had roused from\r\nthe sleep that a blow on the chin had induced and was again on his feet.\r\nFor him no explanation was needed; the shattered cage of the\r\nball-control told its own story.\r\n\r\nHarkness seated Mademoiselle Delacouer on a bench at the pilot's post.\r\n\"You will want to be in on this,\" he told her, \"but I'll put you here in\r\ncase they get rough. But don't worry,\" he added; \"we'll be ready for\r\nthem now.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen he turned to Schwartzmann: \"Now, you! Oh, there are plenty of\r\nthings I could call you! And you would understand them perfectly, though\r\nthey are all words that no gentleman would use.\"\r\n\r\nAt Schwartzmann's outburst of profane rejoinder, Harkness broke in with\r\nno uncertain tones.\r\n\r\n\"Shut up, Schwartzmann, and stay that way; I'm giving the orders now.\r\nAnd we'll just cut out all the pleasantries; they won't get us anywhere.\r\nWe must face the situation, all of us; see what we're up against and\r\nmake some plans.\"\r\n\r\nBut Herr Schwartzmann was not to be put down so easily. He crossed over\r\nto where Chet stood. Chet's hand dropped to the pistol that was hooked\r\nin his own belt, but Schwartzmann made no move toward it. Instead he\r\nplanted himself before the pilot and jammed his fists into his hips\r\nwhile he tried to draw his stocky form to equal Chet's slim height.\r\n\r\n\"Fool!\" he said. \"Dolt! For a minute I believed you; I thought you had\r\ncut us off from the Earth. Now I know better. Max, he understands ships;\r\nand the Herr Doktor Kreiss iss a man of science: together they the\r\nrepairs will make.\"\r\n\r\nThe Master Pilot smiled grimly. \"Try to do it,\" he said, and turned\r\ntoward the two whom Schwartzmann had named. \"You, Max, and you, too,\r\nDoctor Kreiss--do you want to take on the job? If you do, I will help\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nBut the two looked at the shattered controls and shook their heads at\r\ntheir employer.\r\n\r\n\"Impossible!\" the pilot exclaimed. \"Without new parts it can never be\r\ndone.\"\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann seemed about to vent his fury upon the man who dared give\r\nsuch a report, but Doctor Kreiss raised a restraining hand.\r\n\r\n\"Check!\" he said. \"I check that report. Repairs are out of the\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet caught Harkness' eye upon him. \"I'll be back,\" Harkness told him\r\nand went quickly toward the rear of the ship. Their stores were back\r\nthere; would Walt think to get a detonite pistol? He came back into the\r\nroom while the thought was still in Chet's mind. A gun was in each hand;\r\nhe passed one of the weapons to Diane.\r\n\r\nUnconsciously, Schwartzmann felt for his own gun that was in Chet's\r\nbelt. He laughed mirthlessly. \"Two men,\" he said scornfully; \"two men\r\nand a girl!\"\r\n\r\nHarkness paid no attention. \"Now we will get right down to cases,\" he\r\nremarked. \"Two men and a girl is right--plus what is left of one ship.\r\nAnd please don't forget that the ship is ours and all the supplies that\r\nare in it. Now, you listen to me; I've a few things to tell you.\"\r\n\r\nHe faced squarely toward Schwartzmann, and Chet had to repress a grin at\r\nthe steely glint in his companion's eyes. Nice chap, Harkness--nice,\r\neasy-going sort--up to a certain point. Chet had seen him in action\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"First of all,\" Harkness was saying, \"don't think that we have any\r\nillusions about you. You're a killer, and, like all such, you're a\r\ncoward. If you had the upper hand, you would never give us a chance for\r\nour lives. In fact you were ready to throw us out to be gassed when Chet\r\nraised your little bet.\r\n\r\n\"But it looks as if Chet and Mademoiselle Delacouer and I will have to\r\nbe living on this world for some time. We don't want to start that life\r\nby killing off even such as you--not in cold blood. We will give you a\r\nchance; we will split our provisions with you--give you half of what we\r\nhave; you will have to shift for yourselves when that is gone. We will\r\nall have to learn to do that.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain the heavy, glowering face of Schwartzmann broke into a laugh that\r\nwas half sneer.\r\n\r\n\"You're damned kind,\" he told Harkness, \"and, as usual, a fool. Two men\r\nand a girl!\" He half turned to count his own forces.\r\n\r\n\"There are seven of us,\" he challenged; \"seven! And all of them\r\narmed--all but me!\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke a curt order in his own tongue, and each man whipped a pistol\r\nfrom his clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Seven to two,\" he said, and laughed again; \"maybe it iss that Herr\r\nHarkness would like to count them.\r\n\r\n\"_Your_ ship and _your_ supplies!\" he exclaimed scornfully. \"And you\r\nwould be so kind as to giff us food.\r\n\r\n\"_Gott im Himmel!_\" he shouted; \"I show you! I am talking now! We stay\r\nhere--_ja_--because this _Dummkopf_ has the controls _gebrochen_! But it\r\niss we who stay; und you? You go, because I say so. It iss I who rule,\r\nund I prove it--seven to two!\"\r\n\r\n\"Three!\" a firm voice spoke from between Chet and Harkness; \"seven to\r\nthree! Our odds are improving, Herr Schwartzmann.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chet saw from the corner of his eye that the gun in the small hand\r\nof Mademoiselle Diane was entirely unwavering. But he spoke to her\r\nsharply, and his voice merged with that of Harkness who was saying\r\nsomewhat the same words:\r\n\r\n\"Back--go back, Diane! We can handle this. For God's sake, keep out; we\r\ndon't want any shooting.\"\r\n\r\nNeither of the men had drawn his gun. Their hands were ready, but each\r\nhad hoped to end this weird conference without firing a shot. Here was\r\nno place for gun-play and for wounded men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTheir attention was on Diane for the moment. A growled word from their\r\nenemy brought their minds back to him; they turned to find black pistol\r\nmuzzles staring each of them in the eyes. Herr Schwartzmann, in the\r\nlanguage of an earlier day, had got the drop.\r\n\r\n\"Seven to three,\" Schwartzmann said; \"let it go that way; no difference\r\ndoes it make. If I say one word, you die.\"\r\n\r\nChet's arm ached to snap his hand toward his gun. It would be his last\r\nmove, he well knew. He was sick with chagrin to see how easily they had\r\nbeen trapped; Walt had tried to play fair with a man who had not an atom\r\nof fairness in his character. And now--\r\n\r\n\"Seven to three!\" Schwartzmann was gloating--till another voice broke\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\"I don't check your figures.\" The whistling tones were coming from a\r\ntortured throat, but the words were clear and distinct. \"I don't check\r\nyou; I make it six to four--and if one of your men makes a move, Herr\r\nSchwartzmann, I shall blow you to a pulp!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Herr Doktor Kreiss held a gun in a steady hand as he moved a pace\r\nnearer to Chet--a gun whose slender barrel made a glinting line of light\r\ntoward Schwartzmann's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"If the gentlemen and Mademoiselle will permit,\" he offered almost\r\ndiffidently, \"I would prefer to be aligned with them. We are citizens of\r\nanother world now; my former allegiance to Herr Schwartzmann is ended.\r\nThis is--what is it you say?--a new deal. I would like to see it; and I\r\nuse another of your American aphorisms: I would like to see it a square\r\ndeal.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe voice of a scholar, thought Chet; one more used to the precision of\r\nlaboratory phrases than to wild talk like this; but no man to be trifled\r\nwith, nevertheless. Chet did not hesitate to turn despite the pistols\r\nthat were still aimed at him.\r\n\r\nBut Herr Kreiss was not looking in his direction; his eyes were trained\r\nsteadily in the same line as his gun. This little experiment he was\r\nconducting seemed to require his undivided attention until the end. To\r\nSchwartzmann he said sharply:\r\n\r\n\"Your men--order them to drop their weapons. Quick!\"\r\n\r\nAs they clattered upon the floor the scientist turned and extended his\r\nhand to Chet.\r\n\r\n\"And still speaking not too technically,\" he continued, \"this is one\r\nhell of a fix that you have got us into. Even in desperate straits it\r\ntook nerve to do that.\" He pointed to the shattered remains of the\r\nmultiple bars that had been the control mechanism, and added:\r\n\r\n\"I admire that kind of nerve. And, if you don't mind, since we are\r\nexiles together--\" His throat seemed choking him again.\r\n\r\nThere were weapons in the hands of Chet and Harkness; they were not\r\nmaking the same mistake twice. Chet shifted his gun to his left hand\r\nthat he might reach toward the scientist with his right.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you were white all the time,\" Chet told him; \"I'll say you\r\nbelong!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_The Red Swarm_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of a half hour later when Harkness ordered them all\r\noutside. He had accepted Kreiss as an addition to their ranks and had\r\nmade himself plain to Schwartzmann.\r\n\r\nTo the scientist he said. \"You remarked that no ship could hold two\r\ncommanding pilots: that goes for an expedition like this, too. I am in\r\ncommand. If you will take orders we will be mighty glad to have you with\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nAnd to Schwartzmann, in a different tone: \"I am sparing you and your\r\nmen. I ought to shoot you down, but I won't. And I don't expect you to\r\nunderstand why; any decency such as that would beyond you.\r\n\r\n\"But I am letting you live. This world is big enough to hold us both,\r\nand pretty soon I will tell you what part of it you can live in. And\r\nthen remember this one thing, Schwartzmann--get this straight!--you keep\r\nout of my way. I will show you a valley where you and your men can stay.\r\nAnd if ever you leave that valley I will hunt you down as I would one of\r\nthe beasts that you will see in this world.\"\r\n\r\nChet had to repress a little smile that was twitching at his lips; it\r\nalways amused him hugely to see Harkness when roused.\r\n\r\n\"Turn us out to starve?\" Schwartzmann was demanding. \"You would do\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be food there,\" said Harkness curtly: \"suit yourself about\r\nstarving. Only stay where I put you!\"\r\n\r\nBack of the others of Schwartzmann's men, the pilot, Max, was stooping.\r\nHalf-hidden he moved toward the doorway to the rear cabin and to the\r\nstorage-room and gun-rooms beyond. Chet glimpsed him in his silent\r\nretreat.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't do that if I were you, Max,\" he advised quietly.\r\n\"Personally, I think you're all getting off too well; as for myself, I'm\r\nsort of itching for an excuse to let off this gun.\"\r\n\r\nIt was here that Harkness turned to the open port.\r\n\r\n\"Put them out!\" he snapped. \"You, Chet, go out first and line them up as\r\nthey come--but, no, wait: there may be gas out there.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet was beside the port; a breath from outside came to him sweetly\r\nfragrant. A shadow was moving across the smooth lava rock. \"A bird!\" he\r\nthought. Then a flash of red in startling vividness swept past the open\r\ndoor: it was like a quick flicker of living flame. He could not see what\r\nit was, but it was alive--and this answered his question.\r\n\r\n\"Send 'em along,\" he said; \"it seems all right now.\" He stepped through\r\nthe opening in the heavily insulated walls.\r\n\r\nIt was early morning, yet the sun was already hot upon the smooth\r\nexpanse of the lava flow. Some ancient eruption from the distant peaks\r\nthat hemmed in the valley had sent out this flood of molten rock; it was\r\nhard and black now. But, to the right, where the valley went on and up,\r\nand rose gently and widened as it rose, a myriad of red flames and jets\r\nof steam told of the inner fires that still raged.\r\n\r\nThese were the fumeroles where only a month before he and Harkness and\r\nDiane had found clustering savages who were more apes than men; they had\r\nbeen roasting meat at these flames. And below, where the lava stopped,\r\nwas the open glade where the little stream splashed and sparkled: in the\r\nhigh rock walls that hemmed the glade the caves showed black. And,\r\nbeyond the open ground, was the weird forest, where tree-trunks of\r\nghostly white were laced with a network of red veining. They grew close,\r\nthose spectral columns, in a shadow-world beneath the high roof of\r\ngreenery they supported.\r\n\r\nHere was the scene of an earlier adventure. Chet was swept up in the\r\nflood of recollections born of familiar sights and scents. Herr\r\nSchwartzmann, cursing steadily in a guttural tongue, came from the ship\r\nto bring Chet's thoughts back to the more immediate problem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were five others who followed--the pilot and Schwartzmann's four\r\nmen. There had been another, but his body lay huddled upon the bare\r\nlava. He had followed his master far--and here, for him, was the end.\r\n\r\nKreiss' pistol was still in his hand as he came after. Harkness and\r\nDiane were last.\r\n\r\nHarkness pointed with his gun. \"Over there!\" he ordered. \"Get them away\r\nfrom the ship, Chet. Line them up down below there; all the ape-men have\r\ncleared out since we had our last fight. Get them down by the stream.\r\nDiane and I will bring them some supplies, and then we can send them off\r\nfor good.\"\r\n\r\nChet sent Kreiss down first, where an easy slope made the descent a\r\nsimple matter; it had been the bow-wave of the molten lava--here was the\r\nend of that inundation of another age--and the slope was wrinkled and\r\ncreased. Schwartzmann followed; then the others. The last man was ready\r\nto descend when Diane and Walt came back.\r\n\r\nThey had packages of compressed foods. This was all right with Chet, but\r\nhe raised his eyebrows inquiringly at sight of several boxes of\r\nammunition and an extra gun. Harkness smiled good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n\"I will give them one pistol,\" Walt told him, \"and a good supply of\r\nshells. We don't need to be afraid of them with only one gun, and we\r\ncan't leave the poor devils at the mercy of every wild beast.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're the boss,\" said Chet briefly; \"but, for me, I'd sooner give this\r\nSchwartzmann just one bullet--right where it would do the most good.\r\n\r\n\"Let's make him work for it,\" he suggested, and called to the men below:\r\n\r\n\"Come back up here, Schwartzmann! A little present for you--and I'm\r\nsaying you don't deserve it.\"\r\n\r\nHe watched the return trip as Schwartzmann dragged his heavy bulk up the\r\nslope; he was enjoying the man's explosive, panted curses. Beside him\r\nwere Diane and Walt. With them, it was as it had been with him at first.\r\nThey had eyes only for the familiar ground below: the stream, the open\r\nground, the trees....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEach of them was looking down at that lower ground.\r\n\r\nIt was Kreiss standing down there who first caught Chet's attention.\r\nKreiss was trying to shout. Chet saw his waving arms; he stared,\r\npuzzled, at the facial contortions--the working lips from which no sound\r\ncame. He knew that something was wrong. It was a moment or two before he\r\nrealized that Kreiss could not speak, that the throat, injured by the\r\nchoking fumes, had failed him. Then he heard the strangled croak that\r\nKreiss forced from his lips: \"_Behind you!--look behind you!_\"\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann was scrambling to the top where they stood; every man was\r\naccounted for. What had they to fear? And suddenly it was borne in upon\r\nChet's consciousness that he had been hearing a sound--a sound that was\r\nlouder now--a rustling!--a clashing of dry, rasping things! The very air\r\nseemed to hold something ominous.\r\n\r\nHe knew this in the instant while he whirled about; while he heard the\r\ndry rustling change to a humming roar; while he saw, like a cloud of\r\nflame, a great swarm of red, flying things like the one that had flown\r\npast the port--and one, swifter than the rest, that darted from the\r\nswarm and flashed upon him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _One, swifter than the rest, dashed upon him._]\r\n\r\nIt was red--vividly, dazzlingly red! The body of a reptile--a wild\r\nphantasm of distorted dreams--was supported by short, quivering wings.\r\nThe body was some five feet in length, and it was translucent.\r\n\r\nA shell, like the dried husk of some creature long dead!--yet here was\r\nsomething alive, as its quick attack proved. It had a head of dry scales\r\nwhich ended in a projecting black-tipped beak that came like a sword,\r\nstraight and true for Chet's heart. It seemed an age before he could\r\nbring his pistol up and fire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDetonite, as everyone knows, does not explode on impact; the cap of\r\nfulminate in the end of each bullet sets it off. But even this requires\r\nsome resistance--something more than a dry, red husk to check the\r\nbullet's flight. There was no explosion from the tiny shell that Chet's\r\npistol fired, but the bullet did its work. The creature fell plunging to\r\nthe rocky ground, and its transparent wings sent flurries of dust where\r\nthey beat upon the ground. There were others that went down, for the\r\nbullet had gone on and through the great swarm.\r\n\r\nAnd then they attacked.\r\n\r\nThe very fury of the assault saved the huddle of humans. So close were\r\nthe red things pressed together that their vibrating wings beat and\r\nlocked the swarm into a mass. They were almost above their prey. Chet\r\nknew that he was firing upward into the swarm, but the sound of his\r\npistol was lost. The red cloud hung poised in a whirling maelstrom; and\r\nthe pandemonium of clashing wings whipped down to them not only the\r\nsound of their dry scraping but a stench from those reptile bodies that\r\nwas overpowering.\r\n\r\nSickly sweet, the taste of it was in Chet's mouth; the sound of the\r\nfurious swarm was battering at his ears as he knew that his pistol was\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nThere were red bodies on the bare rock before him. A scaly, scabrous\r\nthing was pressing against his upflung hands that he raised above his\r\nhead--a loathsome touch! A beak that was a needle-pointed tube stabbed\r\nhis shoulder before he could flinch aside: the quick pain of it was\r\npiercingly sharp....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOther red horrors dropped from the main mass overhead; he saw Harkness\r\nbeating at them wildly while he made a shelter of his body above the\r\ncrouched figure of Diane. Two of them--two incredible, beastly, flying\r\nthings! He saw them so plainly where they hovered, and Harkness striking\r\nat them with a useless, empty gun, while they waited to drive home their\r\nlance-like beaks.\r\n\r\nThe picture was so plain! His brain was a photographic plate,\r\nsuper-sensitized by the utter horror of the moment. While the red\r\nmonster stabbed its beak into his shoulder, while he drove home one blow\r\nagainst its parchment body with his empty pistol, while the wild,\r\nbeating wings lifted the creature again into the air--he saw it all.\r\n\r\nHere were Diane and Harkness! Nearby Schwartzmann was on the ground! His\r\nman--the one who had not yet descended with the others--was running\r\nstumblingly forward. He was wounded, and the blood was streaming from\r\nhis back. Chet saw the two monsters hovering above Harkness' head; he\r\nsaw their thick-lidded eyes--and he saw those eyes as they detected an\r\neasier prey.\r\n\r\nThe fleeing man was half-stooped in a shambling run. The winged reptile\r\nChet had beaten off joined the other two and they were upon the wounded\r\nman in a flurry of red.\r\n\r\nChet saw him go down and took one involuntary step forward to give him\r\naid--then stopped, transfixed by what he beheld.\r\n\r\nThe man was down crouching in terror. Above him the three monstrous\r\nthings beat each other with their wings; then their long beaks stabbed\r\ndownward. The man's body was hidden, but through those transparent beaks\r\nthere mounted swiftly a red stream. Plainly visible, Chet saw that vital\r\ncurrent--the living life-blood of a living man--drawn into those beastly\r\nbodies; he saw it spread through a network of canals! And he was held\r\nrigid with horror until a harsh scream from Harkness reached his brain.\r\n\r\n\"The trees!\" Harkness was shouting. \"The trees! Down, Chet, for God's\r\nsake! You can't save him!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWalt was half carrying Diane. Even then Chet was vaguely thankful that\r\ntheir bodies were between the girl and this gruesome sight. And Walt was\r\nleaping madly down the lava slope.\r\n\r\nBeyond him, already on the lower level, was the racing figure of\r\nSchwartzmann. A whirring flash of red pursued him. Another made a\r\ncrimson streak through the air toward Walt's back. Chet came with\r\nstartling abruptness from the frozen rigidity that held him, and he\r\ncrashed his empty pistol in well-directed aim through the body of the\r\nbeast. Then he, too, threw himself in great leaps down the slope.\r\n\r\nKreiss was firing from below; Chet knew dimly that this was checking the\r\nattack of the swarm. He saw Walt stagger; saw blood flowing from a slash\r\non the back of his head, and knew that Kreiss had got the monster just\r\nin time. He sprang toward the stumbling man and got his arms under the\r\nunconscious figure of the girl to help carry the load.\r\n\r\nAnd now it was Kreiss who was shouting. \"The trees! We'll be safe in the\r\ntrees!\" He saw Kreiss drop his pistol and dash headlong for the white\r\ntrunks of ghostly trees.\r\n\r\nHis arm was pierced by a stinging pain; cold eyes, with thick, leathery\r\nlids, were staring into Chet's as he cast one horrified glance over his\r\nshoulder. Then he crashed against the white trunk of a tree and helped\r\nHarkness drag the body of the girl between two twin trunks. He pulled\r\nhimself to safety in the shelter of the protecting trees, and held\r\nweakly to one of them.... And the crimson lace-work of the sap-wood that\r\nshowed through the white bark was no brighter red than the mark of his\r\nblood-stained hands where they clung for support.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_Doomed_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was high when they ventured forth. Diane would have come, but\r\nthe two men would have none of it. They remembered the sight they had\r\nseen; they knew what was left of a man's body lying on the rocks above;\r\nand they ordered the girl to stay hidden while Kreiss remained with her\r\nas a guard.\r\n\r\nThere were only the four who lay hidden in the woods; Schwartzmann and\r\nMax, with the remaining three men, were gone. Harkness' calls were\r\nunanswered, and he ceased the halloo.\r\n\r\n\"Better keep quiet,\" he advised himself and the others. \"We are out of\r\nammunition, though they don't know it. And they have got away. They will\r\nkeep on going, too, and I am not any too well pleased with that. I\r\nwanted to put Schwartzmann where I could keep an eye on him.... Oh,\r\nwell, he isn't very dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nBut Chet Bullard made a few mental and unspoken reservations to that\r\nremark. \"That boy is always dangerous,\" he told himself, \"and he won't\r\nbe happy unless he is making trouble. Thank the Lord he hasn't got that\r\ngun!\"\r\n\r\nHe came out cautiously from among the trees, but the red horde was gone.\r\nThe reptiles' wings had rasped and clashed furiously for a time; they\r\nhad darted in fiery flashes before the protecting trees: and the fitful\r\nbreeze had brought gusts of nauseous odors--until a thin haze formed in\r\nthe higher air and the red things were gone.\r\n\r\n\"There will not be any more for a while,\" said Harkness.\r\n\r\nHe pointed toward the fumerole they had seen from the lookout earlier in\r\nthe day: again it was emitting jets of thin, steamy vapor that did not\r\ndisappear like steam but floated up above their heads. \"The gas has\r\ndriven them off,\" he added.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe two men climbed slowly up the slope that had been the wave front of\r\nmolten rock. Chet found his pistol by the path and picked it up.\r\n\r\n\"We'll get more ammunition up top,\" he told Harkness, \"and we will toss\r\nsome down to Kreiss. He can have the extra gun you brought for\r\nSchwartzmann, too.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped suddenly. He had reached the level top of the lava flow. Here\r\nwas where they had stood when the beasts attacked; where Harkness had\r\ndropped the boxes of ammunition and the pistol--and except for a few\r\nscattered bodies of unbelievable reptiles and for a stain of blood where\r\nhis own wound had bled, there was nothing to show where they had been.\r\n\r\n\"He got 'em!\" Chet exclaimed. \"That son-of-a-gun Schwartzmann got the\r\ngun and shells. I saw him scrambling around on the rock. I thought he\r\nwas just scared to death; but no, he wasn't too frightened to grab the\r\ngun and the ammunition while one of his own men was being killed. And\r\nthat's not so good, either!\"\r\n\r\nA dozen paces beyond was a huddle of clothing that stirred idly in the\r\nbreeze. \"The poor devil!\" exclaimed Chet, and moved over beside the body\r\nof the man who had gone down under the red swarm's attack.\r\n\r\nIt lay face down. Chet stooped to turn the body over, though he knew\r\nthere was no hope of life. He stopped with a gasp of dismay.\r\n\r\nTwo eyes still stared in horror from a face that was colorless--a\r\ndrained, ghastly white face! No tint remained to show that this ever had\r\nbeen a living man. More dreadful than the waxen pallor of death, here\r\nwas a bleached, bloodless flesh that told of the nameless horror that\r\nhad overwhelmed this man, beaten him down and drained him of every drop\r\nof blood.\r\n\r\n\"Vampires!\" Chet heard Harkness saying in a horrified whisper. \"Those\r\nbeaks that were like tubes! And they--they--\" He stopped as if in fear\r\nof the words that would tell what they themselves had escaped.\r\n\r\nChet turned the body to its former position; that dreadful face beneath\r\na pitiless sun was a sight no other eyes should see. \"Let's go on to the\r\nship,\" he said. \"We'll get some ammunition, go back and get Diane--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the thought. Before him he saw the lifeless body\r\nmoving; it rolled and shuddered as if life had returned to this thing\r\nwhere no life should be. Chet raised one hand in an unconscious gesture\r\nas if to ward off some new horror that the body might disclose. It was a\r\nmoment before he realized that the rock was shaking beneath his feet,\r\nthat he was dizzy and that from no great distance a rumbling growl was\r\nsounding in his ears.\r\n\r\nThe moving body had shaken Chet's mental poise as had the earthquake his\r\nphysical equilibrium. Harkness had not seen it; he was looking off\r\nacross the level plateau.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" he exclaimed; \"another vent has opened! See it spout?\"\r\n\r\nSome hundred yards distant were clouds of green vapor that rolled into\r\nthe air. At their base a fountain of mud sputtered and spouted and fell\r\nback to build up a cone. The green cloud whirled sluggishly, then was\r\ncaught by the breeze and began its slow, rolling progress across the\r\nflat rock. It was coming their way, rolling down toward the ship, and\r\nChet gripped suddenly at his companion's arm.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" he said! \"I'm going away from here, and I'm going now. We'll\r\nget Diane and Kreiss: remember what a whiff of gas did to him this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\nHe was drawing Harkness toward the face of the rock; he wondered at his\r\nslowness. Walt seemed fascinated by the oncoming cloud.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" Harkness paused at the top of the descending slope. Chet turned,\r\nto look where Harkness was watching.\r\n\r\nThe green cloud moved slowly. As he turned to stare it touched the bow\r\nof their ship; it flowed slowly, sluggishly, along the sides, and then\r\nswept up and over the top. The lookouts of the control room were\r\nobscured, and the port from which they had come!\r\n\r\n\"Cut off!\" breathed Harkness, his voice heavy with hopeless conviction.\r\n\"We can't get back! And now we're on our own past any doubt!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It may not last,\" Chet was urging an hour later, when, with Kreiss and\r\nDiane, they stood on high ground to look down on the ship.\r\n\r\nThe sparkling sheen of the metal cylinder had changed from silver to\r\npale green. The cloud that enveloped it was not heavy, but it was always\r\nthe same. Yet still Chet insisted: \"It may not last.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to disappoint you,\" replied Kreiss, \"but there is little ground\r\nfor such a belief.\" Again he was the professor instructing a class.\r\n\"These fumeroles, in my opinion, are venting a region far below the\r\nsurface. It is possible that further seismic disturbances may alter\r\nconditions; a rearrangement of the lower rock strata may close existing\r\ncrevices and open others like this you have seen; but, barring that, I\r\nsee no reason for thinking that this emission of what appears to be\r\nchlorine with other gases may not continue indefinitely.\"\r\n\r\nChet looked at Diane. Was it a twinkle that appeared and vanished in her\r\neyes as Herr Professor Kreiss concluded his remarks. She would laugh in\r\nthe very face of death, Chet realized, but her tone was entirely serious\r\nas she offered another suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"If this wind should change,\" she said, \"and if it blew the gas in\r\nanother direction, the ship could be cleared. One of us could go in long\r\nenough to switch on the air generators full.\"\r\n\r\nBut now it was Chet who shook his head in a negative. \"Remember,\" he\r\ntold her, \"when we were here before? All of the time while Walt was gone\r\nfor the ship--how did the wind blow then?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same as now,\" she admitted.\r\n\r\n\"And it never changed.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\"--slowly--\"it never changed.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet turned to Walt and Kreiss. \"That's that,\" he said shortly. \"Any\r\nother good ideas in the crowd? Can anyone go through that gas and get to\r\nthe ship? I'll make a try.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suicide!\" was Kreiss' verdict, and Harkness confirmed his words.\r\n\r\n\"I saw things that moved up in the trees,\" he said. \"Lord knows what\r\nthey were; Birds--beasts of some sort! But they were alive till the gas\r\ntouched them. I saw it drift among the trees when we left, and those\r\nthings up there came plopping down like ripe apples.\"\r\n\r\nDiane Delacouer looked up at Harkness with wide, serious eyes. \"Then,\"\r\nshe shrugged, \"we are really--\"\r\n\r\n\"Castaways,\" Harkness told her. \"We're on our own--off on a desert\r\nisland--shipwrecked--all that sort of thing! And you might as well know\r\nthe worst of it; you, too, Kreiss.\r\n\r\n\"Our good friend, Schwartzmann, is at large, and he has the pistol and\r\nammunition we brought out from the ship. He is armed, and we are not; he\r\nhas food, and we have none. And I'll have to admit that I didn't have\r\nany breakfast and could use a little right now.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are seven shells left in my pistol,\" said Diane. She held the\r\nweapon out to Harkness; he took it carefully.\r\n\r\n\"Seven,\" he said; \"it is all we have. We must kill some animals for\r\nfood, my dear, but not with these; we must save these for bigger game.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we cannot!\" expostulated Kreiss. \"To kill game with our bare\r\nhands--impossible! We are doomed!\"\r\n\r\nAnd now Chet caught Diane's glance brimming with mirth that was\r\nundisguised. Truly, Diane Delacouer would have her laugh in the face of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\"Doomed?\" she exclaimed. \"Not while Chet and I know how to make bows and\r\narrows!... Do you suppose we can find any of their old spears, Chet?\r\nThey made gorgeous bows, you remember.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chet bowed low in an exaggeration of admiration that was not\r\nentirely assumed. \"Lead on!\" he said. \"You are in command. The army is\r\nready to follow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_A Premonition_\r\n\r\n\r\nFire Valley had been the home of the ape-men. On that earlier journey\r\nWalt and Chet had seen them, had fought with the tribe, and had lived\r\nfor a time in their caves that made dark shadows high on the rock wall.\r\nAnd they knew that the wood the ape-men used for their spears was well\r\nsuited for bows.\r\n\r\nBack in the caves they found discarded spears and some wood that had\r\nbeen gathered for shafts. Tough, springy, flexible, it was a simple\r\nmatter for the men to convert these into serviceable weapons. Sinews\r\nthat the ape-men had torn from great beasts made the bowstrings, and\r\nthere were other slim shafts that they notched, then sharpened in the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nYet, to Chet as he worked, came an overwhelming feeling of despondency.\r\nTo be fashioning crude weapons like these--preparing to defend\r\nthemselves as best they could from the dangers of this new, raw world!\r\nNo, it could not be true.... And he knew while he protested that it was\r\nall in vain.\r\n\r\nHe asked himself a score of times if his impulsive, desperate act had\r\nnot been a horrible mistake. And he found the same answer always: it was\r\nall he could have done. Had he attacked Schwartzmann he would have been\r\nkilled--and Walt, too! Schwartzmann would have had Diane. Only some such\r\nstupefying shock as the effect of the shattered control could have\r\nchecked Schwartzmann. No, there had been no alternative. And the thing\r\nwas done. Finally, irrevocably done!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet walked to the cave-mouth to stare down at the ship below him in the\r\nvalley. From the fumerole's throat came a steady, rolling cloud of\r\nshimmering green; the ship was immersed in it. The voice of Herr Kreiss\r\nspoke to him; the scientist, too, had come forward for another look.\r\n\r\n\"If it were at the bottom of the sea,\" he said, \"it would be no more\r\ninaccessible. It is, in very fact, at the bottom of a sea--a sea of gas.\r\nWe could penetrate an aqueous medium more easily.\"\r\n\r\n\"And,\" Chet pondered slowly, \"if only I could have returned.... With\r\ntime--and metal bars--and tools that I could improvise--I might....\"\r\n\r\nHis voice trailed off. What use now to speculate on what he might have\r\ndone. The scientist concluded his thought:\r\n\r\n\"You might have reconstructed the control--yes, I, too, had thought of\r\nthat. But now, the gas! No--we must put that out of our minds, unless we\r\nwould become insane.\"\r\n\r\nChet turned back into the black and odorous cave. He saw Harkness who\r\nwas flexing a bow he was making for Diane; he was showing her how to\r\ngrip it and let the arrow run free.\r\n\r\n\"Towahg was the last one I instructed,\" Walt was saying; and Chet knew\r\nfrom the deep lines in his face that his attempt at casual talk was for\r\nDiane's benefit; \"I wonder how long Towahg remembered. He was a grateful\r\nlittle animal.\"\r\n\r\n\"Towahg?\" queried Kreiss. \"Who is Towahg?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ape-man,\" Harkness told him. \"Friendly little rascal; he helped us out\r\nwhen we were here before. He saved Diane's life, no question about that.\r\nI showed him the use of the bow; jumped him ahead a hundred generations\r\nin the art of self-defense.\"\r\n\r\n\"And offense!\" was Kreiss' comment. \"There are certain drawbacks to\r\narming a potential enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Towahg is all right,\" Harkness reassured the scientist, \"although\r\nhe may have taught the trick to others of the tribe who are not so\r\nfriendly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where are they? In what direction do they live?\" Kreiss continued.\r\n\r\n\"Want to make a social call?\" Chet inquired. \"You needn't mind those\r\nlittle formalities up here, Doctor.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut in the mental makeup of Herr Doktor Kreiss had been included no\r\ntrace of humor; he took Chet's remark at face value. And he answered in\r\nwords that echoed Chet's real thoughts and that took the smile from his\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\"But, no,\" said Herr Kreiss; \"it is the contrary that I desire. Here we\r\nare; here we stay for the rest of our lives. I would wish those years to\r\nbe undisturbed. I have no wish to quarrel with what primitive\r\ninhabitants this globe may hold. There is much to study, to learn. I\r\nshall pass the years so.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" he questioned, \"where is it that we go? Where shall be our\r\nhome?\"\r\n\r\nChet, too, looked inquiringly at Harkness. \"You saw more of this country\r\nthan I did,\" he reminded him; \"what would you suggest?\"\r\n\r\nAnd, at sight of the serious, troubled eyes of Diane Delacouer, he\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\"We want a site for a high-grade subdivision, you understand. Something\r\ngood, something exclusive, where we can keep out the less desirable\r\nelement. Dianeville must appeal to the people who rate socially.\"\r\n\r\nAt the puzzled look on the scientist's face, Chet caught Diane's glance\r\nof unspoken amusement, and knew that his ruse had succeeded: he must not\r\nlet Diane get too serious. Harkness answered slowly:\r\n\r\n\"I saw a valley; I think I can find it again. When Towahg guided me back\r\nto the ship, when we were here before, I saw the valley beyond the third\r\nrange of hills. We go up Fire Valley; follow the stream that comes in\r\nfrom the side--\"\r\n\r\n\"Water?\" Chet questioned.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I saw a lake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cover? Trees? Not the man-eating ones?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything: open ground, hills, woods. It looked good to me then; it\r\nwill look a lot better now,\" said Walt enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n\"Walk faster,\" said Chet; \"I'm stepping on your heels.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey reached the valley floor some distance above the fumerole and the\r\nclouds of poison gas; and the march began. The attack of the flying\r\nreptiles had taught them the danger of exposure in the open, and they\r\nkept close to the trees that fringed the valley.\r\n\r\nOnce Chet left them and vanished among the trees, to return with the\r\nbody of an animal slung over one shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Moon-pig!\" he told the others. \"Ask Doctor Kreiss if you want to know\r\nits species and ancestry and such things. All I know is that it has got\r\nhams, and I am going to roast a slice or so before we start.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bow and arrow?\" asked Harkness.\r\n\r\nChet nodded. \"I'm a dead shot,\" he admitted, \"up to a range of ten feet.\r\nThis thing with the funny face stood still for me, so it looks as if we\r\nwon't starve.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun had swung rapidly into the sky; it was now overhead. One half of\r\ntheir first short day was gone. And Chet's suggestions of food met with\r\napproval.\r\n\r\n\"I can't quite get used to it,\" Diane admitted to the rest; \"to think\r\nthat for us time has turned back. We have been dropped into a new and\r\nsavage world, and we must do as the savages of our world did thousands\r\nof years ago. Now!--in nineteen seventy-three!\"\r\n\r\nChet removed a slab of meat from the hot throat of a tiny fumerole.\r\n\"Nineteen seventy-three on Earth,\" he agreed, \"but not here. This is\r\nabout nineteen thousand B.C.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe called to Kreiss who was digging into a thin stratum of rock. The\r\nscientist had a splinter of flint in his hand, and he was gouging at a\r\nred outcropping layer.\r\n\r\n\"Old John Q. Neanderthal, himself!\" said Chet. \"What have you found,\r\nsilver or gold? Whatever it is, you're forgetting to eat; better come\r\nalong.\" But Doctor Kreiss had turned geologist, it was plain.\r\n\r\n\"Cinnabar,\" he said; \"an ore of hydrargyrum!\" His tone was excited, but\r\nChet refused to have his mind turned from practical things.\r\n\r\n\"Is it good to eat?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"_Nein, nein!_\" Kreiss protested. \"It is what you call\r\nmercury--quicksilver!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said Chet dryly, \"I see where this man Kreiss is\r\nto be a big help. He has discovered the site for the thermometer\r\nfactory. He will be organizing a Chamber of Commerce next.\"\r\n\r\nHe left out a portion of the cooked meat for Kreiss' later attention,\r\nand he and Harkness rolled a supply into leaf-wrapped packages and\r\nstowed them in the pockets of their coats before they started on. Again\r\nthe little procession took up the march with Harkness leading.\r\n\r\n\"Leave as little trail as possible,\" Harkness ordered. \"We don't want to\r\nshout to Schwartzmann where we have gone.\"\r\n\r\nThey left the Valley of the Fires to follow the stream-bed in another\r\nhollow between great hills. Chet found himself looking back at the\r\nfamiliar flares with regret. Here was the only place on this new world\r\nwhich was not utterly strange to his eyes. He continued to glance behind\r\nhim, long after the smoky fires were lost to sight; but he would not\r\nadmit even to himself that it was for another reason.\r\n\r\nNineteen seventy-three!--and he was a man of the modern civilization.\r\nYet deep within him there stirred ancient instincts--racial memories,\r\nperhaps. And, as he splashed through the little stream and bent to make\r\nhis way through strange-leafed vines and leprous-spotted trees, a\r\nwarning voice spoke inaudibly within his own mind--spoke as it might\r\nhave whispered to some ancestor scores of centuries dead.\r\n\r\n\"You are followed!\" it told him. \"Listen!--there is one who follows on\r\nthe trail!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n_A Mysterious Rescuer_\r\n\r\n\r\nTheir way led through tangled growths of trees and vines that were like\r\nunreal things of a dream. Unreal they were, too, in their strange degree\r\nof livingness, for there were snaky tendrils that drew back as if in\r\nfear at their approach and stalks that folded great, thorny leaves\r\nprotectingly about pulpy centers at the first touch of a hand. The world\r\nof vegetation seemed strangely sentient and aware of their approach.\r\nOnly the leprous-white trees remained motionless; their red-veined\r\ntrunks towered high in air, and the sun of late afternoon shot\r\nslantingly through a leafy roof overhead.\r\n\r\nTwice Chet let the others go on ahead while he slipped silently into\r\nsome rocky concealment and watched with staring, anxious eyes back along\r\ntheir trail. But the little stream's gurgling whisper was the only\r\nvoice, and in all the weird jungle there was no movement but for the\r\nunfolding of the vegetation where they had passed.\r\n\r\n\"Nerves!\" he reproached himself. \"You're getting jumpy, and that won't\r\ndo.\" But once more he let the others climb on while he stepped quickly\r\nbehind a projecting rock over which he could look.\r\n\r\nAgain there was silence; again the leaves unfolded their thorny\r\nwrappings while vermiform tendrils crept across the ground or reached\r\ntentatively into the air. And then, while the silence was unbroken,\r\nwhile no evidence came through his feeble, human senses, something\r\napproached.\r\n\r\nNeither sight nor sound betrayed it--this something, that came\r\nnoiselessly after--but a tell-tale plant whipped its leaves into their\r\nformer wrapping; a vine drew its hanging clusters of flowers sharply\r\ninto the air. The unseeing watchers of the forest had sensed what was\r\nunheard and unseen, and Chet knew that his own inner warning had been\r\ntrue.\r\n\r\nHe waited to see this mysterious pursuer come into view; and after\r\nwaiting in vain he realized the folly of thinking himself concealed. He\r\nglanced about him; every plant was drawn tightly upon itself. With\r\nsilent voices they were proclaiming his hiding place, warning this other\r\nto wait, telling him that someone was hidden here.\r\n\r\nChet's face, despite his apprehension, drew into a whimsical, silent\r\ngrin. \"No chance to ambush him, whoever he is or whatever it is,\" he\r\ntold himself. \"But that works two ways: he can't jump us when we're\r\nprepared; not in daylight, anyway.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he asked himself a question he could not answer: \"I wonder,\" he\r\nwhispered softly, \"--I wonder what these plants will do at night!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlmost they could see the swift descent of the sun. Each flashing glint\r\nof light through the dense growth came from lower down toward the\r\ninvisible horizon. It shone at last where Chet cast anxious glances\r\nabout upon a mound of rocks.\r\n\r\nRough blocks of tremendous size had been left here from some seismic\r\ndisturbance. Like the ruins of a castle they were heaped high in air.\r\nEven the tree growths stopped at their base, and above them was an\r\nopening in the roof of tangled branches and leaves--a rough circle of\r\nclear, blue sky.\r\n\r\n\"How about making camp?\" Chet asked. \"This place looks good to me. I\r\nwould just as soon be up off the ground a bit.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness looked at the pile of rocks; glanced once toward the sun.\r\n\"Right!\" he agreed. \"This will do for our first camp.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've named it,\" Chet told him as he scrambled to the top of a great\r\nblock. He extended a hand to Diane, standing tired and breathless at its\r\nside.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to First Camp!\" he told her. \"Take this elevator for the first\r\nten floors.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew her up to the top of the block. Harkness joined them, and Diane,\r\nthough she tried to smile in response to Chet, did not refuse their help\r\nin making the ascent; the day's experiences had told on all of them.\r\n\r\nThirty or forty feet above the ground was Chet's estimate. From the top\r\nof their little fort they watched the shadows of night sweep swiftly\r\ndown. Scrub tree growths whose roots had anchored among the rocks gave\r\nthem shelter, while vines and mosses softened the hard outlines of the\r\nlabyrinth of stones.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet undid the package of meat and passed it out freely. There had been\r\nscurryings and rustlings in the jungle growth that had reassured him in\r\nthe matter of food. Darkness fell as they ate; then it gave way to a new\r\nflood of light.\r\n\r\nGolden light from a monstrous moon! It sent searching fingers through\r\nrifts in the leafy roof, then poured itself over the edge of the opening\r\nabove in a cascade of glory. And, though each one of the four raised his\r\neyes toward that distant globe and knew it for the Earth, no word was\r\nsaid; they ate their food in silence while the silent night wrapped them\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nStill in silence they prepared for the night. Chet and Harkness\r\nimprovised a bed for Diane in the shelter of a sheer-rising rock. They\r\ntore off pieces of moss and stripped leaves from the climbing vines to\r\nmake a mattress for her; then withdrew with Kreiss to a short distance\r\nwhile Chet told them of his suspicions.\r\n\r\n\"Six hours of night,\" he said at last; \"that means two hours for each of\r\nus. We'll take turns standing guard.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness insisted upon being first. Chet flipped a coin with Kreiss and\r\ndrew the last turn of guard duty. He stretched himself out on a bit of\r\nground where vegetation had gained a foothold among the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"It's going to take me a while to get used to these short days,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Six hours of daylight; six hours of night. This is a funny,\r\nlittle world--but it's the only one we've got.\"\r\n\r\nThe night air was softly warm; the day had been hard on muscles and\r\nnerves. Chet stared toward the glorious ball of light that was their\r\nmoon. There were men and women there who were going about their normal\r\naffairs. Ships were roaring through the air at their appointed levels;\r\ntheir pilots were checking their courses, laughing, joking.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet resolutely withdrew his eyes. Think? Hell, no! That was one thing\r\nthat he must not do. He threw one arm across his eyes to shut out the\r\nlight that brought visions of a world he would never see again--that\r\nemphasized the utter hopelessness of their position.... His next\r\nconscious sensation was of his shoulder being shaken, while the hushed\r\nvoice of Doctor Kreiss said:\r\n\r\n\"Your turn now, Herr Bullard; four hours have you slept.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Kreiss, Chet took the pistol with its seven precious shells. \"All\r\nquiet,\" Kreiss told him as he prepared to take Chet's place on the soft\r\nleaves; \"strange, flying things have I seen, but they do not come near.\r\nAnd of your mysterious pursuer we have seen nothing. You imagined it,\r\nperhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"I might have imagined it,\" Chet answered, \"but don't try to tell me\r\nthat the plants did. I'll give this vegetation credit for some damned\r\nuncanny powers but not for imagination--I draw the line there.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked toward the highest point of rock and shook his head. \"Too\r\nplain a target if I'm up there,\" he argued, and took up his position in\r\nthe shadows instead.\r\n\r\nOnce he moved cautiously toward the place they had prepared for Diane.\r\nShe was breathing softly and regularly. And on the rock at her side,\r\nwith only his jacket for a bed, lay Harkness. Their hands were clasped,\r\nand Chet knew that the girl slept peacefully in the assurance of that\r\ntouch.\r\n\r\n\"They don't make 'em any finer!\" he was telling himself, and at the same\r\nmoment he stiffened abruptly to attention.\r\n\r\nSomething was moving! Through and above the hushed noises of the night\r\nhad come a gliding sound. It was an indescribable sound, too elusive for\r\nidentification; and Chet, in the next instant, could not be sure of its\r\nreality. He did not call, but swung alertly back on guard and slipped\r\nfrom shadow to shadow as he made his way across the welter of rocks.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe stopped at last in strained listening to the silent night. One hand\r\nupon a great stone block at his side steadied his body in tense, poised\r\nconcentration.\r\n\r\nFrom afar came a whistling note whose thin keenness was mingled with a\r\nsqueal of fright: some marauder of the night had found its prey. From\r\nthe leafy canopy above him voices whispered as the night wind set a\r\nmyriad leaves in motion. The thousand tiny sounds that blend to make the\r\nsilence of the dark! These he heard, and nothing more, while he forced\r\nhimself to listen beyond them. He followed with his eyes the creeping\r\nflood of Earth-light that came slantingly now through the opening above\r\nto half-illumine this rocky world; and then, in the far margin of that\r\nlight he found something on which his eyes focused sharply--something\r\nthat moved!\r\n\r\nWalt!--Kreiss--he must arouse them! A shout of alarm was in his\r\nthroat--a shout that was never uttered. For, from the darkness at his\r\nback--not where this moving thing had been disclosed by the friendly\r\nEarth-light, but from the place he had just left--came a scream of pure\r\nterror. It was the shocking scream of a person roused from sleep in\r\nutter fright, and the voice was that of Diane.\r\n\r\n\"Walter!\" she cried! \"Walt!\" There were other words that ended in a\r\nstrangling, choking sound, while a hoarse shout from Harkness merged\r\ninto a discord that rang horribly through the still night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet was racing across the rocks; the pistol was in his hand. What\r\nfearful thing would he face? What was it that had attacked? He forced\r\nhis leaden feet to carry him on in a succession of wild leaps. Forgotten\r\nwas the menace behind him, although he half saw, half sensed, a shadow\r\nthat moved faster than he along the upper rocks. He thought only of the\r\nunknown horror that was ahead, that had drawn that despairing shriek\r\nfrom the brave lips of Diane. The few seconds of his crossing were an\r\nage in length.\r\n\r\nOne last spring, one vivid instant while the Earth-light marked in sharp\r\ndistinctness the figure of a leaping man! It was Harkness, throwing\r\nhimself into the air, trying vainly to reach the struggling form of\r\nDiane Delacouer. She was held high above his head, and she was wrapped\r\nin the coils of a monster serpent--coils that finished in a\r\nsmoothly-rounded end. And Chet knew in that instant of horror that the\r\nthing was headless!\r\n\r\nHe was raising his pistol to fire; the long moments that seemed never to\r\nend were in actuality an instant. Where should he aim? He must not\r\ninjure Diane.\r\n\r\nFrom the high rocks beside him came a glint of light, a straight line of\r\nreflected brilliance as from a poised and slender shaft. It moved, it\r\nflashed downward, it hissed angrily as it passed close to Chet's head.\r\nIt went on, a spear like a flash of light--on and down, to drive sharply\r\ninto the body of that serpent shape! And the coils, at that blow,\r\nrelaxed, while the figure of Diane Delacouer fell limply to the\r\noutstretched, cushioning arms of the man below....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHad the weapon been thrown with uncanny accuracy, or had it been meant\r\nfor him? Chet could not be sure. But he knew that before him Walt\r\nHarkness was bending protectingly above the unconscious figure of a\r\ngirl, while above and about the two there flailed a terrible, headless\r\nthing that beat the rocks with sledge-hammer blows. It struck Harkness\r\nonce and sent him staggering, and once it came close to Chet so that his\r\nhands closed upon it for an instant. And with the touch he knew that\r\nthis serpent was no animal shape, but worse--a creeping tendril from\r\nsome flesh-eating horror of the vegetable world.\r\n\r\nHe dashed in beside Walt; he saw Kreiss hurrying across the rocks. They\r\nhad Diane safely out of reach of the threshing, striking thing before\r\nthe scientist arrived.\r\n\r\nThe spear that had passed close to Chet had pinned this deadly thing to\r\nearth; it tore loose as they watched, and the wounded tendril, with the\r\nspear still hanging from its side, slid swiftly down the slope and into\r\nthe darkness at the foot of the rocks.\r\n\r\nEven the calm preciseness of Herr Kreiss was shattered by the attack. In\r\na confusion of words he stammered questions that went unanswered. Chet\r\nthrust his pistol into Harkness' hands and was off down the rocky slope\r\ntoward the springs where they had got water for their evening meal. A\r\nrolled leaf made a cup that he held carefully while he climbed back. A\r\nfew minutes later the pallid face of Diane showed a faint flush, while\r\nshe drew a choking breath.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness held the girl's head in his arms; he was uttering words of\r\nendearment that were mingled with vicious curses for the thing that had\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that,\" argued Chet; \"that one won't bother us again, and\r\nafter this we will be on guard. But here is something to wonder about.\r\nWhat about this spear? Where did it come from?\"\r\n\r\nHarkness had eyes only for Diane's tremulous smile. \"I am all right,\r\ntruly,\" she assured him. Only then did he turn in bewilderment to Chet.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you threw it! But of course not; you couldn't; we didn't have\r\nany spears.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Chet; \"I didn't throw it. I saw something moving over across\r\nthere\"--he pointed toward the farther rocks where he had been--\"I was\r\ngoing to call when Diane's scream beat me to it. But what I saw wasn't\r\nthe thing that attacked her. And if it was the same one who threw that\r\nspear he must have come across here in a hurry. And that spear, by the\r\nway, came uncomfortably close to my head. I'm not at all sure but it was\r\nmeant for me.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness released his arms from Diane, for she was now able to sit\r\nerect. He picked up the crude bow that had been beside him and fitted an\r\narrow to the string.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go and have a look,\" he promised grimly. But Chet held him back.\r\n\r\n\"You're not thinking straight; this shock has knocked you out of\r\ncontrol. If that little stranger with the spear meant to help us there's\r\nno need of hunting him out; he doesn't seem anxious to show himself. And\r\nif he meant it for me, he's still too good a shot to fool with in the\r\ndark. You stick here until daylight.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is good advice,\" Herr Kreiss agreed. \"The night, it will soon be\r\ngone.\" He was looking at the leafy opening overhead where the golden\r\nlight of a distant Earth was fading before the glow of approaching day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_The Sacrificial Altar_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am off the trail,\" Harkness admitted. \"Towahg guided me before; I\r\nwish he were here to do it now.\"\r\n\r\nThey had pushed on for another short day, Harkness leading, and Chet\r\nbringing up the rear and casting frequent backward glances in a vain\r\neffort to catch a glimpse of some other moving figure.\r\n\r\nSmothered at times in a dense tangle of vegetation, where they sweated\r\nand worked with aching muscles to tear a path; watching always for the\r\nflaming, crimson buds on grotesque trees, whose limbs were waving,\r\nundulating arms and from which came tendrils like the one that had\r\nnearly ended Diane's life, they fought their way on.\r\n\r\nThey had seen the buds on that earlier trip; had seen the revolting\r\nbeauty of them--the fleshy lips that opened above a pool of death into\r\nwhich those reaching arms would drop any living thing they touched. They\r\nkept well out of reach when a splash of crimson against the white trees\r\nflashed in warning.\r\n\r\nAgain they would traverse an open space, where outcropping rocks would\r\nsend Kreiss into transports of delight over their rich mineral contents.\r\nBut always their leader's eyes were turned toward a range of hills.\r\n\r\n\"It is beyond there,\" he assured them, \"if only we can reach it.\"\r\nHarkness pointed to a scar on a mountainside where a crystal outcrop in\r\na sheer face of rock sparkled brilliantly in the sunlight. \"I remember\r\nthat--it isn't so very far--and we can look back down the valley from\r\nthere and see our ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we'll never make it to-night,\" said Chet; \"it's a case of making\r\ncamp again.\"\r\n\r\nThey had gained an altitude of perhaps a thousand feet. No longer did\r\nthe jungle press so hard upon them. Even the single file that had been\r\ntheir manner of marching could be abandoned, and Harkness drew Diane to\r\nhis side that he might lend her some of his own strength.\r\n\r\nAgain the soft contours of the rolling ground had been disturbed: a\r\nlandslide in some other century had sent a torrent of boulders from the\r\nhigh slopes above. Harkness threaded his way among great masses of\r\ngranite to come at last to an opening where massive monoliths formed a\r\ngateway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was an entrance to another valley. They did not need to enter, for\r\nthey could skirt it and continue toward the high pass in the hills. But\r\nthe gateway seemed inviting. Harkness took Diane's hand to help her\r\ntoward it; the others followed.\r\n\r\nThe fast sinking sun had buried itself behind a distant range, and long\r\nshadows swept swiftly across the world, as if the oncoming night were\r\nalive--as if it were rousing from the somnolence of its daytime sleep\r\nand reaching out with black and clutching hands toward a fearful,\r\nwaiting world.\r\n\r\n\"No twilight here,\" Chet observed; \"let's find a hide-out--a cave, by\r\nchoice--where we can guard the entrance and--\"\r\n\r\nA gasp from Diane checked him. \"Oh!\" she exclaimed. \"It is not real!\r\n_C'est impossible!_\"\r\n\r\nChet had been busied with the matter of a secure footing; he looked up\r\nnow and took a step forward where Harkness and Diane stood motionless in\r\na gateway of stone. And he, too, stopped as if stunned by the weird\r\nbeauty of the scene.\r\n\r\nA valley. Its length reached out before them to end some half mile away.\r\nSides that might once have sloped evenly seemed weathered to a series of\r\ngreat steps, and an alternation of striations in black and white made a\r\nbanding that encircled the entire oval. Each step was dead-black stone,\r\neach riser was snow-white marble; and the steps mounted up and up until\r\nthey resembled the sides of a great bowl. In the center, like an altar\r\nfor the worship of some wild, gargantuan god, was a stepped pyramid of\r\nthe same startling black and white. Banded like the walls, it rose to\r\nhalf their height to finish in a capstone cut square and true.\r\n\r\nAn altar, perhaps; an arena, beyond a doubt, or so it seemed to Chet. He\r\nwas first to put the impression in words.\r\n\r\n\"A stadium!\" he marvelled; \"an arena for the games of the gods!\"\r\n\r\n\"The gods,\" Diane breathed softly, \"of a wild, lost world--\" But Chet\r\nheld to another thought.\r\n\r\n\"Who--who built it?\" he asked. \"It's tremendous! There is nothing like\r\nit on Earth!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnly Kreiss seemed oblivious to the weird beauty of the spectacle. To\r\nProfessor Kreiss dolomite and black flint rock were dolomite and black\r\nflint; interesting specimens--a peculiar arrangement--but nature must be\r\npermitted her little vagaries.\r\n\r\n\"Who built it?\" He repeated Chet's question and gave a short laugh\r\nbefore answering in words. \"The rains, Herr Bullard, and the winds of\r\nages past. Yes, yes! A most remarkable example of erosion--most\r\nremarkable! I must return this way some time and give it my serious\r\nattention.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness had not spoken; he was shaking his head doubtfully at Kreiss'\r\nwords. \"I am inclined to agree with Chet,\" he said slowly. \"But who\r\ncould have built a gigantic work like this? Have there been former\r\ncivilisations here?\"\r\n\r\nHe straightened up and shook himself free from the effects of the wild,\r\nbarbaric scene.\r\n\r\n\"And you needn't come back,\" he told Kreiss; \"you can have a look now,\r\nto-night, by moonlight. We can't go on. I think we'll be safest on that\r\nbig altar rock; nothing will get near us without our knowing.\"\r\n\r\nChet felt Diane Delacouer's hand on his arm; her other hand was gripping\r\nat Harkness. The shiver that passed through her was plainly perceptible.\r\n\"I'm afraid,\" she confessed in a half-whisper; \"there's something about\r\nit: I do not like it. There is evil there--danger. We should not enter.\"\r\n\r\nWalt Harkness gently patted the hand that trembled on his arm. \"I don't\r\nwonder that you are all shot to pieces,\" he assured her. \"After last\r\nnight, you've a right to be. But I really believe this is the safest\r\nspot we can find.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe stepped forward beyond the great stones that were like a gateway from\r\none wildly impossible world to another. A rock slide, it seemed, had\r\nsmoothed off the great steps from where they stood, for there was a\r\ndescending slope that gave easy footing. He took one step, and then\r\nanother, to show the girl how foolish were her fears; then he started\r\nback. In the fading light something had flashed from the jungle they had\r\nleft. Across the rocky expanse it came, to bury itself in the loose soil\r\nand rubble, not two paces in advance of the startled man. An arrow!--and\r\nit stood quivering in silent warning on the path ahead.\r\n\r\nChet quietly unslung his bow where he had looped it over one shoulder,\r\nbut Harkness motioned him back. The pistol was in his hand, but after a\r\nmoment's hesitation he returned that to his belt. His voice was low and\r\ntense.\r\n\r\n\"Listen,\" he said: \"we're no match for them with our bows. They are\r\nhidden; they could pick us off as we came. And I can't waste a single\r\ndetonite shell on them while they keep out of sight. We can't go back;\r\nwe must go ahead. We will all make a break for it and run as fast as we\r\ncan toward the big altar--the pyramid. From there we can stand them off\r\nfor a while. And we will go now and take them by surprise.\"\r\n\r\nHe seized Diane firmly by one arm and steadied her as they dashed down\r\nthe slope. Chet and the professor were close behind. Each spine must\r\nhave tingled in anticipation of a shower of arrows. Chet threw one hasty\r\nlook toward the rear; the air was clear; no slender shafts pursued them.\r\nBut from the cover of the jungle growth came a peculiar sound, almost\r\nlike a human in distress--a call like a moaning cry.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey slackened their breath-taking pace and approached the great pyramid\r\nmore slowly. As they drew near, the great steps took on their real size;\r\neach block was taller even than Chet, and he had to reach above his head\r\nto touch the edge of the stone.\r\n\r\nThey walked quickly about; found a place where the great blocks were\r\nbroken down, where the slope was littered with debris from the\r\ndisintegrating stone that had sifted down from above. They could climb\r\nhere; it was almost like a crudely formed set of more normally sized\r\nsteps. They made their way upward while Chet counted the courses of\r\nstone. Six, then eight--ten--and here Harkness called a halt.\r\n\r\n\"This--will do,\" he gasped between labored breaths. \"Safe enough here.\r\nChet, you and Kreiss--spread out--watch from all--sides.\"\r\n\r\nThe pilot was not as badly winded as Harkness who bad been helping\r\nDiane. \"Stay here,\" he told Harkness; \"you too, Kreiss; make yourselves\r\ncomfortable. I will go on up to the top. The moon--or the Earth,\r\nrather--will be up pretty soon; I can keep watch in all directions from\r\nup there. We've got to get some sleep; can't let whoever it is that is\r\ntrailing us rob us of our rest or we'll soon be no good. I'll call you\r\nafter a while.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe great capstone projected beyond the blocks that supported it; that\r\nmuch had been apparent from the ground. But Chet was amazed at the size\r\nof the monolith when he stood at last on the broad step over which this\r\ncapstone projected like a roof.\r\n\r\nThe shadows were deep beneath, and Chet, knowing that he could never\r\ndraw himself to the top of the great slab whose under side he could\r\nbarely touch, knew also that he must watch from all sides. The shadowed\r\nfloor beneath the big stone made a shelter from any watchful eyes out\r\nthere in the night; here would be his beat as sentry. He walked slowly\r\nto the side of the pyramid, then around toward the front.\r\n\r\nIt was the front to Chet because it faced the entrance, the rocky\r\ngateway, where they had come in. He did not expect to find that side in\r\nany way differing from the first. Each side was twenty paces in length;\r\nChet measured them carefully, astounded still at the size of the\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\n\"Carved by the winds and rains,\" he said, repeating the opinion of\r\nProfessor Kreiss. \"Now, I wonder.... It seems too regular, too much as\r\nif--\" He paused in his thoughts as he reached the corner; waited to\r\nstare watchfully out into the night; turned the corner, and, still in\r\nshadow, moved on. \"Too much as if nature had had some help!\"\r\n\r\nHis meditation ended as abruptly as did his steady pacing: he was\r\nchecked in midstride, one foot outstretched, while he struggled for\r\nbalance and fought to keep from taking that forward step.\r\n\r\nIn the shelter of the capstone was a darker shadow; there was a\r\nblackness there that could mean only the opening of a cave--a cavern,\r\nwhose regular outlines and square-cut portal dismissed for all time the\r\nthought of a natural opening in the rock. But it was not this alone that\r\nhad brought the man up short in his stealthy stride: it had jolted him\r\nas if he had walked head on into the great monolith itself. It was not\r\nthis but a flat platform before the cave, a raised stone surface some\r\ntwo feet above the floor. And on it, pale and unreal in the first light\r\nof the rising Earth was a naked, human form--a face that grimaced with\r\ndistorted features.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet had known the ape-men on that earlier visit: he knew that while\r\nmost of them were heavily covered with hair there were some who were\r\nalmost human in their hairlessness. The body before him was one of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nIt lay limply across the stone platform, the listless head hanging\r\ndownward over one edge. It had high cheekbones, a retreating forehead,\r\nglassy, staring eyes, and grinning teeth that projected from between\r\nloose lips. And the evening wind stirred the black, stringy hair while\r\nit touched lightly upon the ends of a short length of vine about the\r\nape-man's neck, where only the ends could be seen, for the rest of the\r\npliant vine was sunk deeply into the flesh of the neck. It had been the\r\ninstrument of death; the ape-man had been strangled.\r\n\r\nChet tore his fascinated eyes from the revolting features of that purple\r\nface; he forced himself to look beyond at what else might be on this\r\nsacrificial stone. And, as he saw the assortment of fruit that was there\r\non a green mat of leaves, the surprise was even greater than would have\r\nfollowed a repetition of the first discovery.\r\n\r\nA naked, murdered man!--and ripe fruit! What was the meaning of this?\r\nChet asked himself a score of questions and found the answer to none.\r\nBut one thing he knew now beyond a doubt: Herr Professor Kreiss had been\r\nwrong. This was truly an altar for the performance of unknown and savage\r\nrites, and the altar itself and the whole encircling arena had been\r\ncreated by some intelligence. People--things--embodied intelligences of\r\nsome sort had carved these stones. Chet was oppressed by a feeling of\r\nimpending danger.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts came back sharply to the things on the stone: the absurdly\r\ncontrasting exhibits: a naked body and fruit! But were they so\r\ndifferent? he asked himself, and knew in the same instant that they were\r\nnot. They were one and the same; they differed only in kind. They were\r\nboth food!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the darkness beyond came a shuffling of feet. From the black\r\npassage someone was coming--drawing near to the portal--and coming\r\nslowly, steadily through the dark. The pad of animal feet would have\r\nbeen unnerving--or the stealthy footfalls of an approaching savage--but\r\nthis was neither; it was a scuffing, shuffling sound. The sweat stood\r\nout in beads on Chet's forehead and a trickle of it reached his eyes. He\r\ndashed it away with the back of his hand while he drew silently into the\r\nshadow of the overhanging stone. He held his breath as he watched in the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nHis pistol came noiselessly from his belt. Yet, how could he fire it? he\r\nasked himself in a moment of frantic planning. Only seven cartridges\r\nleft!--they would need them all; and to fire now would bring more\r\nenemies upon them. He returned the gun to his belt and stooped to weigh\r\na fragment of stone in his hand: this must serve him as a weapon.\r\n\r\nThe dragging footsteps were near, where the passage mouth loomed black.\r\nThe light of a distant Earth, struck slantingly across to leave this\r\nface of the pyramid in half-darkness. From that far and peaceful world\r\nthe light poured floodingly down; it shone in under the projecting\r\ncapstone; it struck upon the raised altar and revealed in ghastliest\r\ndetail the gruesome offering there. And surely the strangest sight of\r\nall that that Earth-light disclosed was when it shone golden upon a\r\nblack and hairy body of a beast that was half man, half ape. The\r\ncreature moved slowly forward, walking erect, with its furry arms\r\nstretched gropingly ahead. In the full light it went shuffling on like\r\none who is blind or who walks in the dark, until it stopped before the\r\naltar stone and stood rigidly waiting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWaiting for what? Chet was making demands upon his reason that was\r\nalready taxed beyond its capacity. He heard nothing, and he knew with\r\nentire certainty that there was no audible call, yet he sensed the\r\nmessage at the instant the ape-man moved.\r\n\r\n\"Flesh!\" said the message. \"Bring flesh! Bring it now!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, with glazed, wide-open eyes which plainly saw, but could not\r\ncomprehend, the ape-thing stared at the altar-stone. It bent forward,\r\ntook the fresh-killed body by the throat, and slung it across one\r\nshoulder as easily as a child might handle a doll; then it turned and\r\nvanished once more into the waiting dark.\r\n\r\n\"God!\" breathed Chet when the vision had passed. \"God help us! What does\r\nit mean?\"\r\n\r\nHe took one backward step, then another, and made his way in silence\r\nalong the path he had come. He must get back to the others to tell them\r\nof what he had seen; to help them to flee from this place of horror that\r\nwas more terrible for its qualities of the unknown.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe gave his companions the story in staccato sentences. \"And the ape-man\r\nwas unconscious,\" he concluded; \"he was an automaton only, directed by\r\nanother brain. I know it. I got that message, I tell you; it was radioed\r\nby someone or by something--sent direct to that big ape's brain.\r\n\r\n\"Now let's get out of here. Diane had it right when she said that the\r\nplace was evil. But she didn't make it strong enough. It's foul with\r\nevil! It's damned! Come on, I'm leaving now!\"\r\n\r\nChet's whispered words were uttered with all the emphasis that horror\r\ncould instill. He knew that he spoke truth. But he could not know how\r\nmistaken was his last positive assertion.\r\n\r\n\"I'm leaving now!\" Chet had said, and how desperately he wanted to put\r\nthis place behind him only he himself could know. He took one step\r\ntoward the place where they could descend; then Harkness' hand pulled\r\nhim roughly to his knees.\r\n\r\n\"Down!\" Harkness was commanding; \"get down, Chet! They're coming--a\r\nswarm of them--through the gate!\"\r\n\r\nThe pilot heard them before he saw them. They began a chant as they\r\npoured through the entrance, a weird, wailing note like the cry of a\r\nstricken animal that cries on and on. Then he saw the swarm.\r\n\r\nThey came in a cataract of black bodies that spilled through that stone\r\nportal and down the long slope. They formed a ragged column on the\r\nground and came on toward the pyramid, where, unseen, three men and a\r\ngirl from another world were crouching.\r\n\r\n\"Back!\" Chet ordered in a whisper. \"Keep low--in the shadow! Get around\r\nin back of the pyramid. We can make a run for it!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey crept swiftly along the rocky step where the deep angle was in\r\nshadow. They reached the rear slope where Chet had climbed. And each one\r\nknew without the speaking of a word that retreat was not to be\r\nconsidered. The open arena!--the high bank of great steps in their bold\r\nmarkings of black and white! They could never hope to scale them; they\r\nwould never even reach them alive, for the savage horde would overwhelm\r\nthem before they had crossed the Earth-lit ground.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Chet in acceptance of their unspoken thoughts, \"up it\r\nis! Here's a hand, Diane--up you go! Now watch your step, and climb as\r\nif a thousand devils were after you, for there's all of that!\"\r\n\r\nThe wave of bodies was washing against the pyramid's base when Chet drew\r\nKreiss, the last of the four, into the shadow of the huge capstone. The\r\nnoise of their climbing had been covered by the wailing cry that came\r\npiercing shrilly from the throng far below. And they had been unseen,\r\nChet was sure; unless the one furtive shadow that he had seen draw away\r\nfrom the crowd and slip around toward the rear of the pyramid meant that\r\nsome one of the tribe had found their trail.\r\n\r\nFrom the front of the shadowed top came the shuffling of heavy, dragging\r\nfeet on the stone. It was the same as before. Chet had held some vague\r\nidea of fighting off the horde from the top of the steps, for here was\r\nthe only place where they could ascend. He had forgotten this other one\r\nfor the moment, and he realized in a single flashing instant that here\r\nwas a worse menace than the pack.\r\n\r\nOnly one, it was true, one ape-man who would be no match for them! But\r\nChet remembered those blind, staring eyes and the message that had come\r\nto him. Those eyes had seen the horrible food upon the altar; some other\r\nbrain had seen it too. The ape-man was an instrument only; there was\r\nsome hidden horror in back of him, something that saw with his eyes,\r\nsomething that must never see them, cowering and huddled in the shadow\r\nof that great stone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe shuffling was coming from the right; Chet clutched silently at the\r\nothers to draw them away and toward the left. They retreated to the\r\ncorner, turned it, and went on toward the front; then stopped in silent\r\nwaiting where the shadow ended. The front, where the altar stood, was in\r\nthe full glare of Earth.\r\n\r\nFor the moment they were safe, but what of the time when the ape-man\r\nreturned? He had descended to the ground; when he climbed back again\r\nwould he retrace his steps? Or would he come this side and trap them\r\nhere where the light of their own Earth made any forward step\r\nimpossible?\r\n\r\nBelow them the wailing ceased. Chet leaned forward to see the black\r\nhorde, silent and motionless. Approaching them was the \"big ape\" he had\r\nseen at the altar. His hands were reaching blindly before him and he\r\nmoved as would a human when entranced.\r\n\r\nHe reached the huddled blacks; his groping hands hovered hesitantly\r\nabove a cowering, hairy form. Presently the ape-man passed on to the\r\nnext, and his hands rested on the creature's face. From the massed\r\nfigures there rose a moan, and Chet felt poignantly the animal misery of\r\nit. Suddenly all emotion was transformed to startled attention. From the\r\nslope at the rear had come the rattle of loose stones!\r\n\r\nFar below, in plain view, was the one who had descended--Chet knew that\r\nhis eyes could never mistake that blind, groping figure--but from the\r\nslope they could not see, from around the far edge of the pyramid, a\r\nclicking stone sent a repeated warning.\r\n\r\nChet laid a hand on Harkness' arm. \"Get set, Walt!\" he warned. \"Get\r\nready for trouble. There's something coming: it may come this way!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_In the Shadow of the Pyramid_\r\n\r\n\r\nThey waited, unbreathing, listening to the occasional stealthy sounds.\r\nThe pistol was still in Chet's belt; the three men were crouched before\r\nDiane, in their hands the crude weapons that they had made.\r\n\r\nAnd then the sounds ceased. The menace seemed to have passed, or to be\r\nwithheld; the men had been tensely prepared for some minutes when Diane\r\nspoke softly.\r\n\r\n\"Look below,\" she whispered; \"the savages! That big one seems to be\r\nchoosing them--selecting some from among them.\"\r\n\r\nChet forced himself to look away from that corner of the rocky step\r\nwhere he had been expecting an unknown enemy to appear, and he stared\r\nbelow them where the Earth-light from the fully risen globe swept across\r\nthe arena.\r\n\r\nHe was amazed at the numbers of the savages that the full light\r\ndisclosed. There were hundreds--yes, thousands--of them, he estimated.\r\nAnd they were standing in black, clotted masses, standing awed and\r\nsilent in a world that was all black and white in a dazzling contrast,\r\nwhile there passed among them one with outstretched arms.\r\n\r\nThe black, hairy hands would hover over a cowering head; the eyes, Chet\r\nknew, were staring widely, blindly, at the shivering creature before\r\nhim. And if Chet's surmise was correct, there was another--a hidden,\r\nmysterious something--who was taking the message of those eyes as the\r\nape-man's brain transmitted it; taking it and sending back instructions\r\nas to which victims should be selected.\r\n\r\nOften the hands passed on; but soon they would descend to touch the\r\nsavage face of another in the assemblage. At the touch the selected one\r\njerked sharply erect, then walked stiffly from the ranks to join a group\r\nthat was waiting.\r\n\r\nAt last there were nearly a hundred savage figures in that group, all\r\ngrown men, young and in the full flood of their savage strength. No\r\nwomen were chosen, nor children, though there were countless little\r\nblack bodies huddled with the others.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA prolific race, indeed, Chet thought, and this human automaton down\r\nthere was leaving the women to produce more victims; leaving the\r\nchildren till they were fully grown, taking only the best and strongest\r\nof the pack--for what?\r\n\r\nHis question was answered in part in the next instant. While the wailing\r\ncry quivered again upon the air, the chosen hundred took up their\r\nsomnambulistic walk. The messenger from the pyramid came after like a\r\nherdsman driving cattle to the slaughter. They passed from Chet's view\r\nas they rounded the rear of the pyramid, and then he heard the scuff and\r\nclatter of their ascent.\r\n\r\nNo need to explain to the others; each of the four saw all too clearly\r\ntheir predicament. From the rear, coming steadily on, was the savage\r\nthrong; before them, plainly visible from below, was the lighted edge\r\nwhere the altar rock stood. To step out there in full view would bring\r\nthe whole pack upon them; to drop down to another level would expose\r\nthem as plainly. Only in the dark shelter of the projecting capstone\r\nwere they hidden from the upturned faces now massed solidly about.\r\n\r\nTheir problem was solved for them by the sight of a savage body, black,\r\nragged with unkempt tufts of hair--another!--a score of them! They were\r\nrounding the corner of the pyramid and walking stiffly toward them,\r\npressing upon them.\r\n\r\nAnd the arrow on the drawn bow in Chet's hand was never loosed, for each\r\nsavage face was wide-eyed and devoid of expression; the ape-men neither\r\nsaw nor felt them. They were hypnotized, as Chet was suddenly aware;\r\nthey knew only that they must follow the mental instructions that were\r\nguiding them on.\r\n\r\nThe black, animal bodies were upon them. Chet came from the stupefying\r\nwonder that had claimed them all and sprang to shield the group from the\r\nsteady advance. Harkness was beside him, and an instant later, Kreiss;\r\nDiane was at their backs. And the weight of the advancing bodies swept\r\nthem irresistibly backward, out into the light, along the wide step\r\ntoward the passage that yawned darkly under the projecting cap.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no checking the avalanche of bodies--no resisting them: the\r\nmen were carried along; it was all they could do to keep their footing.\r\nHarkness sprang backward to take Diane in his arms and retreat with her\r\nbefore the advancing horde. Chet was waiting for an outcry from below,\r\nfor some indication that despite the mass of bodies that smothered them,\r\ntheir presence had been observed. But only the wailing cry persisted.\r\n\r\nThere was another advancing column that had circled the other side, and\r\nnow both groups were meeting at the passageway. Chet gripped at the\r\nfigure of Kreiss who was being swept helpless toward the dark vault and\r\nhe dragged him back. The two fought their way out toward the front and\r\nsaw Harkness doing the same.\r\n\r\n\"The altar,\" gasped Chet; \"up on the altar!\" And he saw Harkness swing\r\nDiane up on the stone, then turn and extend a helping hand toward the\r\ntwo men.\r\n\r\nSafe in the sanctuary of this altar dedicated to some deity that they\r\ncould never imagine, they crouched close to its blood-clotted surface,\r\nand still there was no change in the cry from below.\r\n\r\n\"Let them all go in,\" Harkness whispered. \"Then follow them into the\r\nshadow. There will no more come up here, I imagine. We will make our\r\nescape after a bit.\"\r\n\r\nThe black mouth of the passage had swallowed the ape-men by solid\r\nscores, and now only some stragglers were left. Harkness was speaking in\r\nquick, whispered orders:\r\n\r\n\"Follow the last ones. Keep stooped over so they won't spot us from\r\nbelow. Wait in the darkness of the entrance.\"\r\n\r\nChet saw him crouch low as he crept from the stone. Diane followed, then\r\nKreiss; and Chet next, close behind a shambling ape-figure that slunk\r\ninto the darkness of the passageway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat it was a passage Chet had not the least doubt. It had taken in\r\nthese scores of savage figures, taken them somewhere; but where it led\r\nor why these poor stunned creatures had been chosen he could not know.\r\nYet he remembered the one message he had caught: \"Flesh! Bring flesh!\"\r\nIt had meant only one thing: it was food that was wanted--human food!\r\nAnd the fetid stench that was wafted from the darkness of this place of\r\nmystery and horror, that made him reel back and put a hand to his\r\nrevolted lips, would not have encouraged him, even had he had any desire\r\nto learn the answer to the puzzle.\r\n\r\nDiane was half-crouching; she was choking with the foul air. Harkness\r\nspoke gaspingly as he took her by the arm:\r\n\r\n\"Outside, for God's sake!... Horrible!... Get Diane outside--try lying\r\ndown--we may be out of sight!\"\r\n\r\nBut this time he did not follow his own instructions. He rose erect,\r\ninstead, and stood swaying as if dazed; and Chet saw that before him,\r\noutlined against the lighted opening in the rock, was the messenger he\r\nhad seen.\r\n\r\nBlack against the bright Earth-light, his features were lost; no\r\nexpression could be seen. But his eyes, that were dead and white like\r\nthe upturned belly of a fish, came suddenly to life. They glared from\r\nthe dark face with a light that came almost visibly from them to the\r\nstaring eyes of Walt Harkness. Chet saw Harkness stiffen, one upraised\r\nhand falling woodenly to his side; a cry of warning was strangled in his\r\nthroat, and then the glaring eyes passed on to the face of Diane.\r\n\r\nChet had forgotten this messenger from the pyramid's hidden horror. If\r\nhe had thought of him at all he had assumed that he had passed in with\r\nthe other crowding ape-men; he was one like them, undistinguishable from\r\nthe rest. And now the savage figure was before them in terrifying\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe eyes passed on to Kreiss. Then the ugly face swung toward Chet, and,\r\nas their eyes met, it seemed to Chet that a blow had crashed stunningly\r\nupon his brain. He tried to move--he knew that he must move. He must\r\nreach for his bow, must leap upon this hulking brute and beat at the\r\nglaring eyes with his bare fists. And his muscles that he tried to rouse\r\nto action might have changed to stone, so unresponsive were they, and\r\nunmoving.\r\n\r\nThe hairy hands reached out and touched Harkness. They passed on and\r\nlingered upon the blanched features of the girl, and Chet raged inwardly\r\nat his inability to resist and her utter helplessness to draw away. Then\r\nKreiss; and again Chet's turn. And, with the touching of those rough\r\nanimal hands, he felt that a contact had been established with some\r\ndistant force--a something that communicated with him, that sent\r\nthoughts which his brain phrased in words.\r\n\r\n\"Curious!\" said those thoughts. \"How exceedingly curious! We shall be\r\ninterested in learning more. We shall learn all we can in one way and\r\nanother of this new race. We shall dismember them slowly, all but the\r\nwoman: we find her strangely attractive.... You will bring them to us at\r\nonce.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chet knew that the instructions were for the messenger whose hands\r\ncame stiffly upward to point the way; while, with a portion of his mind\r\nthat was functioning freely, Chet raged as he saw Diane take the first\r\nstiff, involuntary step forward. Then Harkness and Kreiss! and he knew\r\nthat he too must follow, knew himself to be as helpless as the driven\r\nbrutes he had seen herded down below. And then, with the same mind that\r\nwas still able to comprehend the messages of his own eyes and ears, he\r\nknew that from behind the savage figure there had come a sound.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis senses were alert, sharpened to an abnormal degree; the almost\r\nsilent footfall otherwise could never have been heard.\r\n\r\nThe raised hand swung toward him; he knew that he must turn and follow\r\nthe others to whatever awaited.... But the hand paused! Then swiftly the\r\nsavage figure swung to face toward the entrance, and those blazing eyes,\r\nas Chet knew, were a match for any opponent.\r\n\r\nBut the eyes never found what they looked for and the quick swing of the\r\nbig ape-body was never completed. In the portal of light there was\r\nframed a naked figure which sprang as if from nowhere, squat, savage and\r\nape-like, but hairless. Its arms were upraised; the hands held a bow;\r\nand the twang of the bowstring came as one with the ripping thud of a\r\nshaft that was tearing through flesh.\r\n\r\nThe savage fell in mid-turn; and it seemed as if the blazing light of\r\nthe terrible eyes must have flicked out before the breath of Death. And,\r\nprotruding from the thick neck, was the shaft of a crude arrow.... There\r\nwere others that flashed, thudding and quivering, into the body that\r\njerked with each impact, then lay still, a darker blot on the floor of a\r\ndark cave.\r\n\r\nChet was breathless; it was an instant before he realized that he was\r\nfree, that the hypnotic bonds that had bound him were loosed. It was\r\nanother instant before he sensed that his companions were still\r\nmarching--trudging stiffly, woodenly off through the dark. He bounded\r\nafter, heedless of bruising walls; he followed where the sound of their\r\nscuffling feet marked their progress to a sure doom.\r\n\r\nThere were stairs; how he sensed them Chet could not have told. But he\r\npaused, hesitated a moment, then found the first step and half ran, half\r\nfell, through the utter darkness of the pit into which they had gone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe odors that had seemed the utmost of vileness now came to him a\r\nhundred times worse. They tore at his throat with a strangling grip, and\r\nhe was weak with nausea when he crashed upon a figure that he knew, was\r\nKreiss. Then on, to grasp at Diane and Harkness; to drag them to a\r\nstandstill in the darkness that pressed upon them smotheringly, while he\r\nshook them, beat at them, shouted their names.\r\n\r\n\"Diane! Walt! Wake up! Wake up, I tell you! We're going back!\"\r\n\r\nHe swung them around; forced them to face about.\r\n\r\n\"Walt, for God's sake, wake up! Diane! Kreiss!\" The deep, sobbing breath\r\nof Diane was the first encouraging response.\r\n\r\nThen: \"Free!\" she gasped. \"I'm free!\" And Harkness and Kreiss both\r\nmumbled incoherently as they came from their hypnotic stupor.\r\n\r\n\"How--\" began Harkness, \"how did you--\" But Chet waited for no\r\nexplanation of the seeming miracle that had just taken place.\r\n\r\n\"Go back,\" he told them, \"--back up the steps!\" And a babble of cries\r\nthat were terrifying in their inhuman savagery welled up from the depths\r\nof the pyramid to urge them on.\r\n\r\nThe body of their captor was prone on the floor above: they stepped over\r\nit to reach the entrance. No figure showed there now; Chet stooped low\r\nand stepped forth cautiously that the surging horde on the ground might\r\nnot see him. The others followed. He felt Harkness' hand in a sudden\r\nwarning grip upon him.\r\n\r\n\"Chet!\" said Harkness, \"there is something there in the shadow--there!\"\r\nAnd Chet saw, even before Walt pointed, a wriggling figure that crept\r\ntoward them.\r\n\r\nHe struck down the bow that Kreiss had raised, and a ray of light came\r\nthrough a jagged niche in the rock above to fall upon the face of the\r\none who drew near.\r\n\r\nAbjectly, in utmost humility, the naked figure crept toward their feet,\r\nand the savage face that was raised to theirs was wreathed in a\r\ndistorted smile.\r\n\r\nBeside him, Chet felt Harkness struggling to speak. In wondering tones\r\nthat were almost unbelieving, Harkness choked out one word.\r\n\r\n\"Towahg!\" he said. \"Towahg!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the thick lips in that upraised face echoed proudly:\r\n\r\n\"Towahg! Me come!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_Happy Valley_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Towahg!\" Chet marveled; \"you little devil! It's you who has been\r\nfollowing us all this time!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish he hadn't been so bashful,\" Harkness added. \"If he had come out\r\nand showed himself he would have saved us a lot of trouble.\" But\r\nHarkness stepped forward and patted the black shoulder that quivered\r\nwith joy beneath his touch. \"Good boy, Towahg!\" he told the grinning\r\nape-man.\r\n\r\nMonkey-like, Towahg had to imitate, and this time he gave a reproduction\r\nof his own acts. He wriggled toward the entrance of the passage, peered\r\naround the edge, and seemed to see something that made him draw back.\r\nThen he fitted an arrow to his bow and springing upright, let it fly.\r\n\r\nSo realistic was the performance that Chet actually expected to see\r\nanother enemy transfixed, but the squat figure of Towahg was doing a\r\ndance of victory beside the prostrate figure of the first and only\r\nvictim. Chet reached out with one long arm and swung the exulting savage\r\nabout. He heard Herr Kreiss expressing his opinion in accents of\r\ndisgust.\r\n\r\n\"Ugly little beast!\" Kreiss was saying. \"And murderous!\"\r\n\r\nThere was no time to lose: the sound of scrambling bodies was coming\r\nnearer from the dark pit beyond. Yet, even then, Chet found an instant\r\nto defend the black.\r\n\r\n\"Damned lucky for us that he is a murderer!\" he told Kreiss. Then to\r\nTowahg:\r\n\r\n\"Listen, you little imp of hell! You don't know more than ten words, but\r\nget this!\"\r\n\r\nChet was standing where the Earth-light struck upon him; he pointed into\r\nthe dark where the sounds of pursuit grew loud, and he shook his head\r\nand screwed his features into an expression that was supposed to depict\r\nfear. \"No! No!\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe dragged the savage forward and pointed cautiously to the milling\r\nhorde below, and repeated, \"No! No!\" Then he included them all in a wave\r\nof his hand and pointed back and out into the night. And Towahg's\r\nunlovely features were again twisted into what was for him a smile, as\r\nhe grunted some unintelligible syllables and motioned them to follow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt had taken but an instant. Towahg was scurrying in advance; he sped\r\nlike a shadow of a passing cloud, and behind him the others followed,\r\ncrouching low in the shelter of the deep-cut step. No figures were below\r\nthem at the rear of the pyramid, and Chet reached for one of Diane's\r\narms, while Harkness took the other. Between them they held her from\r\nfalling while they followed the dark blur that was Towahg leaping\r\nnoiselessly down the long slope.\r\n\r\nNo time for caution now. The savage ahead of them leaped silently; his\r\nflying feet hardly disturbed a stone. But beneath them, Chet felt a\r\nsmall landslide of rubble that came with them in their flight. And above\r\nthe noise of their going came a sound that sped them on--the rising\r\nshout of wonder from the unseen multitude in front, and a chorus of\r\nanimal cries from the pyramid's top.\r\n\r\nChet saw a blot of black figures at the top of the slope just as they\r\nfelt firm ground beneath their feet. They followed where Towahg led in a\r\nswift race across the open arena toward the great steps at the rear.\r\nBlack and white in strongly contrasting bands, the rock reared itself in\r\na barrier that, to Chet, seemed hopelessly unsurmountable. He felt that\r\nthey had come to the end of their tether.\r\n\r\n\"Trapped!\" he told himself, and wondered at Towahg's leading them into\r\nsuch a cul-de-sac, even while he knew that retreat in other directions\r\nwas cut off. The pursuit was gaining on them; savages from beyond the\r\npyramid had sighted them now in the full light of Earth, and their\r\nyelping cry came mingled with hoarse growls as the full pack took the\r\ntrail. Ahead of them, Towahg, reaching the base of the first white step,\r\nwas dancing with excitement beside a narrow cleft in the rocks. He led\r\nthe way through the small passage. And Harkness, bringing up the rear,\r\ntook the detonite pistol in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"One shell! We'll have to waste it!\" he said, and raised the weapon.\r\n\r\nIts own explosion was slight, but the sound of the bursting cartridge\r\nwhen its grain of detonite struck the rocks made a thunderous noise as\r\nit echoed between the narrow walls.\r\n\r\n\"That will check the pursuit,\" Harkness exulted; \"that will make them\r\nstop and think it over.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was another hour before Towahg slackened his pace. He had led them\r\nthrough jungle that to them seemed impassable; had shown them the hidden\r\ntrails and warned them against spiked plants whose darts were needle\r\nsharp. At last he led them to a splashing stream where they followed him\r\nthrough the trackless water for a mile or more.\r\n\r\nThe mountain with the white scar was their beacon. Harkness pointed it\r\nout to their guide and made him understand that that was where they\r\nwould go.\r\n\r\nAnd, when night was gone, and the first rays of the rising sun made a\r\nquickly changing kaleidoscope of the colorful east, they came at last to\r\na barren height. Behind them was a maze of valleys and rolling hills;\r\nbeyond these was a place of smoke, where red fires shone pale in the\r\nearly light, and set off at one side was a shape whose cylindrical\r\noutline could be plainly seen. It caught the first light of the sun to\r\nreflect it in sparkling lines and glittering points, and every\r\nreflection came back to them tinged with pale green, by which they knew\r\nthat the gas was still there.\r\n\r\nChet turned from a prospect that could only be depressing. His muscles\r\nwere heavy with the poisons of utter fatigue; the others must be the\r\nsame, but for the present they were safe, and they could find some\r\nposition that they could defend. Towahg would be a valuable ally. And\r\nnow their lives were ahead of them--lives of loneliness, of exile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness, too, had been staring back toward that ship that was their\r\nonly link with their lost world; his eyes met Chet's in an exchange of\r\nglances that showed how similar were their thoughts. And then, at sound\r\nof a glad laugh from Diane, their looks of despair gave place to\r\nsomething more like shame, and Chet shifted his own eyes quickly away.\r\n\r\n\"It is beautiful, Walter,\" Diane was saying: \"the lovely valley, the\r\nlake, the three mountain peaks like sentinels. It is marvelous. And we\r\nwill be happy there, all of us, I know it.... Happy Valley. There--I've\r\nnamed it! Do you like the name, Walter?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chet saw Harkness' reply in a quick pressure of his hand on one of\r\nDiane's. And he knew why Walt looked suddenly away without giving her an\r\nanswer in words.\r\n\r\n\"Happy Valley!\" Diane of all the four had shown the ability to rise\r\nabove desperate physical weariness, above a despondent mood, to dare\r\nlook ahead instead of backward and to find hope for happiness in the\r\nprospect.\r\n\r\nOff at one side, Chet saw Kreiss; the scientist's weariness was\r\nforgotten while he ran like a puppy after a bird, in pursuit of a\r\nfloating butterfly that drifted like a wind-blown flower. And Harkness,\r\nunspeaking, was still clinging to Diane's firm hand.... Yes, thought\r\nChet, there was happiness to be found here. For himself, it would be\r\nmore than a little lonesome. But, he reflected, what happiness was there\r\nin any place or thing more than the happiness we put there for\r\nourselves?... Happy Valley--and why not? He dared to meet the girl's\r\neyes now, and the smile on his lips spread to his own eyes, as he echoed\r\nhis thoughts:\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" he asked. \"Happy Valley it is; we just didn't recognize it at\r\nfirst.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey came to the lake at last; its sparkling blue had drawn them from\r\nafar off: it was still lovelier as they came near. Here was the same\r\nsteady west wind that had driven the gas upon their ship. But here it\r\nruffled the velvet of waving grasses that swept down to the margin of\r\nthe lake. There was a higher knoll that rose sharply from the shore, and\r\nback of all were forests of white-trunked trees.\r\n\r\nChet had seen none of the crimson buds, nor threatening tendrils since\r\nentering the valley. And Towahg confirmed his estimate of the valley's\r\nsafety. He waved one naked arm in an all-inclusive gesture, and he drew\r\nupon his limited vocabulary to tell them of this place.\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" he said, and waved his arm again. \"Good! Good!\"\r\n\r\n\"Towahg, you're a silver-tongued orator,\" Chet told him: \"no one could\r\nhave described it better. You're darned right; it's good.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his head to take a deep breath of the fragrant air; it was\r\nintoxicating with its blending of spicy odors. At his feet the water\r\nmade emerald waves, where the clear, deep blue of the reflected sky\r\nmerged with yellow sand. Fish darted through the deeper pools where the\r\nbeach shelved off, and above them the air held flashing colorful things\r\nthat circled and skimmed above the waves.\r\n\r\nThe rippling grass was so green, the sky and lake so intense a blue, and\r\none mountainous mass of cloud shone in a white too blinding to be borne.\r\nAnd over it all flowed the warm, soft air that seemed vibrant with a\r\nlife-force pulsing strongly through this virgin world.\r\n\r\nDiane called from where she and Harkness had wandered through the lush\r\ngrass. Kreiss had thrown himself upon a strip of warm sand and was\r\noblivious to the beauties that surrounded him. Towahg was squatted like\r\na half-human frog, binding new heads on his arrows.\r\n\r\n\"Chet,\" she called, \"come over here and help me to exclaim over this\r\nbeautiful place. Walter talks only of building a house and arranging a\r\nplace that we can defend. He is so very practical.\"\r\n\r\n\"Practical!\" exclaimed Chet. \"Why, Walt's a dreamer and a poet compared\r\nto me. I'm thinking of food. Hey, Towahg,\" he called to the black,\r\n\"let's eat!\" He amplified this with unmistakable pointings at his mouth\r\nand suggestive rubbing of his stomach, and Towahg started off at a run\r\ntoward trees that were heavy with strange fruit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy night there were unmistakable signs that the hand of man had been at\r\nwork. A band of savages would have accepted the place as they found it;\r\nfor them the shelter of a rock would have sufficed. They would have\r\npassed on to other hunting grounds and only a handful of ashes and a\r\nbroken branch, perhaps, would have marked where they had been. But your\r\ncivilized man is never satisfied.\r\n\r\nAlong the mile of shore was open ground. Here the trees approached the\r\nwater: again their solid rampart of ghostly trunks was held back some\r\nhundreds of yards. And the open ground was vividly green where the soft\r\ngrass waved; and it was matted, too, with crimson and gold of countless\r\nflowers. A beautiful carpet, flung down by the edge of a crystal lake,\r\nand the flowered covering swept up and over the one high knoll that\r\ntouched the shore.... And on the knoll, near an outcrop of limestone\r\nrocks, was a house.\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly pretentious,\" Chet had admitted, \"but we'll do better later\r\non.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will keep Diane under cover,\" argued Harkness; \"these leaves are\r\nlike leather.\"\r\n\r\nHe helped Diane put another strip of leaf in place on the roof; a twist\r\nof green vine tied around the stem held it loosely.\r\n\r\nThe leaves were huge, as much as ten feet in diameter: great circles of\r\nleathery green that they cut with a pocket knife and \"tailored\" as Diane\r\ncalled it to fit the rough framework of the hut. Towahg had found them\r\nand had given them a name that they did not trouble to learn. \"Towahg's\r\ngrunts sound so much alike,\" Diane complained smilingly. \"He seems to\r\nknow his natural history, but he is difficult to understand.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut Towahg proved a valuable man. He cracked two round stones together,\r\nand cleaved off one to a rounded edge. He bound this with withes to a\r\nshort stick and in a few minutes had a serviceable stone ax that bit\r\ninto slender saplings that were needed for a framework.\r\n\r\nChet nodded his head to call Kreiss' attention to that. \"Herr Doktor,\"\r\nhe said, \"it isn't every scientist who has the chance to see a close-up\r\nof the stone age.\"\r\n\r\nBut Herr Kreiss, as Chet told Harkness later, did not seem to \"snuggle\r\nup nice and friendly\" to the grinning savage. \"He is armed better than\r\nwe,\" Kreiss complained. \"I do not trust him. It is an impossible\r\nsituation, this, that civilized men should be dependent upon one so\r\nsavage. For what is our _kultur_, our great advancement in all lines of\r\nmental endeavor, if at the last, when tested by nature, we must rely\r\nupon such assistance?\"\r\n\r\nChet saw Herr Doktor Kreiss draw himself aloof with meticulous care as\r\nTowahg dashed by, and it occurred to him that perhaps it was as well for\r\nKreiss that the black one knew so little of what was said.\r\n\r\nBut aloud he merely said: \"You'll have lots of chances to use that\r\nmental endeavor stuff later on, Doctor. But right now what we need to\r\nknow is how to get by without any of your laboratories, without text\r\nbooks or tools, with just our bare hands and with brains that are geared\r\nup to the civilization you mention and don't do us a whole lot of good\r\nhere. Better let Towahg show us what he knows.\"\r\n\r\nBut Herr Kreiss only shrugged his thin shoulders and wandered off\r\nthrough this research-man's paradise, where every flower and insect and\r\nstone were calling to him. Chet envied the equanimity with which the man\r\nhad accepted his lot, had come to this place and was prepared to spend\r\nhis remaining years collecting scientific data that were to him\r\nall-important.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain the sun sank swiftly. But this time, Chet stretched himself\r\nluxuriously upon the matted grass and turned to stare at the little fire\r\nthat burned before the entrance of Diane's shelter. His pocket fireflash\r\nhad kindled some dry sticks that burned without smoke.\r\n\r\n\"We will be a little careful about smoke,\" Harkness had warned them all.\r\n\"No use of broadcasting the news of our being here. We have come a long\r\nway and I think there is small chance of Schwartzmann's party or the\r\nsavages finding us in this spot.\"\r\n\r\nBeyond the fire, Harkness raised himself now to sit erect and glance\r\nabout the circle of fire-lit faces. \"There's plenty of planning to be\r\ndone,\" he said. \"There is the matter of defense; we must build a\r\nbarricade of some sort. As for shelter, we must remember that we will be\r\nhere a long time and that we might as well face it. We will need to\r\nbuild some serviceable shelters. Then, what about clothes? These we are\r\nwearing are none the better for the trip through the jungle: they won't\r\nlast forever. We've got to learn--Lord! we've got to learn so many\r\nthings!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the first of many councils was begun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n_A Bag of Green Gas_\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder a tree on the edge of the open ground a notched stick hung. Six\r\nsharply cut V's showed red through the white bark, then one that was\r\ndeeper; another six and another deeper cut; more of them until the stick\r\nwas full: so passed the little days.\r\n\r\n\"Some time,\" Herr Kreiss had promised, \"I shall determine with accuracy\r\nthe length of our Dark Moon days; then we will convert these crude\r\nrecords into Earth time. It is good that we should not lose our\r\nknowledge of the days on Earth.\" He made a ceremony each morning of the\r\ncutting of another notch.\r\n\r\nChet, too, had a bit of daily routine that was never neglected. Each\r\nsunrise found him on the high divide; each morning he watched for the\r\nglint and sparkle of sunlight as it flashed from a metal ship; and each\r\nmorning the reflected light came to him tinged with green, until he knew\r\nat last that it might never be different. The poisonous fumes filled the\r\npocket at the end of the valley where the great ship rested. She was\r\nindeed at the bottom of a sea.\r\n\r\nBack at camp were other signs of the passing days. Around the top of the\r\nknoll a palisade had sprung up. Stakes buried in the ground, with\r\nsharpened ends pointing up and outward, were interwoven with tough vines\r\nto make a barricade that would check any direct assault. And, within the\r\nenclosure, near the little hut that had been built for Diane, were other\r\nshelters. One black night of tropic rainstorm had taught the necessity\r\nfor roofs that would protect them from torrential downpours.\r\n\r\nThese did well enough for the present, these temporary shelters and\r\ndefenses, and they had kept Diane and the two men working like mad when\r\nit was essential that they have something to do, something to think of,\r\nthat they might not brood too long and deeply on their situation and the\r\nlife of exile they were facing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor Kreiss this was not necessary. In Herr Kreiss, it seemed, were the\r\nqualities of the stoic. They were exiled--that was a fact; Herr Kreiss\r\naccepted it and put it aside. For, about him, were countless things\r\nanimate and inanimate of this new world, things which must be taken into\r\nhis thin hands, examined, classified and catalogued in his mind.\r\n\r\nIn the rocky outcrop at the top of their knoll he had found a cave with\r\nwhich this rock seemed honeycombed. Here, within the shelter of the\r\nbarricade, he had established what he called very seriously his\r\n\"laboratory.\" And here he brought strange animals from the\r\njungle--flying things that were more like bats than birds, yet colored\r\ngorgeously. Chet found him one day quietly exultant over a wrinkled\r\npiece of parchment. He was sharpening a quill into a pen, and a\r\ncup-shaped stone held some dark liquid that was evidently ink.\r\n\r\n\"So much data to record,\" he said. \"There will be others who will follow\r\nus some day. Perhaps not during our lifetime, but they will come. These\r\ndiscoveries are mine; I must have the records for them.... And later I\r\nwill make paper,\" he added as an afterthought; \"there is papyrus growing\r\nin the lake.\"\r\n\r\nBut on the whole, Kreiss kept strictly to himself. \"He's a lone wolf,\"\r\nChet told the others, \"and now that he is bringing in those heavy loads\r\nof metals he is more exclusive than ever: won't let me into the back end\r\nof his cave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does he think we will steal his gold?\" Harkness asked moodily. \"What\r\ngood is gold to us here?\"\r\n\r\n\"He may have gold,\" Chet informed him, \"but he has something more\r\nvaluable too. I saw some chunks that glowed in the dark. Rotten with\r\nradium, he told me. But even so, he is welcome to it: we can't use it.\r\nNo, I don't think he suspects us of wanting his trophies; he's merely\r\nthe kind that flocks by himself. He was having a wonderful time today\r\npounding out some of his metals with a stone hammer; I heard him at it\r\nall day. He seems to have settled down in that cave for keeps.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness threw another stick across the fire; its warmth was unneeded,\r\nbut its dancing flames were cheering.\r\n\r\n\"And that is something we must make up our minds about,\" he said slowly:\r\n\"are we to stay here, or should we move on?\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped to the ground near where Diane was sitting, and took one of\r\nher hands in his.\r\n\r\n\"Diane and I plan to 'set up housekeeping,'\" he told Chet, and Chet saw\r\nhim smile whimsically at the words. Housekeeping on the Dark Moon would\r\nbe primitive indeed. \"We are lacking in some of the customary features\r\nof a wedding; we seem to be just out of ministers or civil officials to\r\ntie the knot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Elect me Mayor of Dianeville,\" Chet suggested with a grin, \"and I'll\r\nmarry you--if you think those formalities are necessary here.\"\r\n\r\nDiane broke in. \"It's foolish of me, Chet, I know it; but don't laugh at\r\nme.\" He saw her lips tremble for an instant. \"You see, we're so far away\r\nfrom--from everything, and it seems that that if Walter and I could just\r\nstart our lives with a really and truly marriage--oh, I know it is\r\nfoolish--\"\r\n\r\nThis time Chet interrupted. \"After all you have been through, and after\r\nthe bravery you've shown, I think you are entitled to a little\r\n'foolishness.' And you _shall_ be married with as good a knot as any\r\nminister could tie: you see, that is one of the advantages of being a\r\nMaster Pilot. My warrant permits me to perform a marriage service in any\r\nlevel above the surface of the Earth. A left-over from the time when\r\nship's captains had the same right. And although we are grounded for\r\nkeeps, if we are not above the surface of the Earth right now I don't\r\nknow anything about altitudes. But,\" he added as if it were an\r\nafterthought, \"my fee, although I hate to mention it, is five dollars.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHarkness gravely reached into the pocket of his ragged coat and brought\r\nout a wallet. He tendered a five dollar bill to Chet. \"I think you're\r\nrobbing me,\" he complained, \"but that's what happens when there is no\r\ncompetition. And we'll start building a house to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will we?\" Chet inquired. \"Is this the best place? For my part I would\r\nfeel safer if there were more miles between us and that pyramid. What\r\nwas down in there, God knows. But there was something back of that\r\nhypnotized ape--something that knocked us for a crash landing with one\r\nlook from those eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe night air was warm, where he lay before their huts, but a shiver of\r\napprehension gripped him at the thought of a mysterious Something that\r\nwas beyond the power of his imagination, and that was an enemy they\r\nwould never want to face. Something inhuman in its cold brutality, yet\r\nsuperhuman too, if this mental force were an indication. A something\r\ndifferent from anything the people of Earth had ever known, bestial and\r\ndamnable!\r\n\r\n\"I am with you on that,\" Harkness agreed, \"but what about the ship? You\r\nhave had your eye on it every day; do we want to go where we could not\r\nsee it? If the gas cleared, if there was ever a season when the wind\r\nchanged, think of what that would mean. Ammunition, food, supplies of\r\nall kinds, and the ship as a place of refuge, too, would be lost. No, we\r\ncan't turn that over to Schwartzmann, Chet; we've got to stick around.\"\r\n\r\n\"I still wish we were farther away,\" Chet acknowledged, \"but you are\r\nright, Walt; we could never be satisfied a single day if we thought the\r\nship could be reached. Then, too, Towahg seems to think this is O. K.\r\n\r\n\"As near as I can learn from his sign language and a dozen words, this\r\nis about as good a spot as we can find. He says the ape-men never cross\r\nthe big divide; something spooky about it I judged. However, we must\r\nremember this: the fact that Towahg came across shows that the rest of\r\nthem would if they found it could be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was why he led us so far while we waded up that stream,\" offered\r\nDiane. \"Trailing Towahg would be like trying to follow the wake of an\r\nairship.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I asked him about the red vampires that jumped us down by the\r\nship,\" Chet continued. \"He gave me the clear sign on that, too.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDiane was not anxious for more wanderings, as Chet could see. \"There is\r\ngame here,\" she suggested, \"and the edge of the jungle is simply an\r\norchard of fruit, as you know. And having a lake to bathe in is\r\nimportant--oh, I must not try to influence you. We must do what is\r\nbest.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Chet, \"our own wishes don't count; the ship's the deciding\r\nfactor. You had better build your house here, Walt. Happy Valley will be\r\nheadquarters for the expedition; we've got a whale of a lot of country\r\nto explore. And, of course, we will slip back and check up on\r\nSchwartzmann; find out where he went to--\"\r\n\r\n\"Count me out;\" Harkness interrupted; \"count me out. You go and hunt\r\ntrouble if you want to; Diane and I will have our hands full right here.\r\nGreat heavens, man! We've got to learn to make clothes; and, by the way,\r\nthat uniform you're wearing is no credit to your tailor. If we are to\r\ncall this home, we must do better than the savages. I intend to find\r\nsome bamboo, split it, make some troughs, and bring water down here from\r\nthe spring. I've got to learn where Kreiss is getting his metal and find\r\nsome soft enough to hammer into dishes. We can't call the department\r\nstore by radiophone, you know, and have them shoot a bunch of stuff out\r\nby pneumatic tube.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" Chet mocked; \"by the time you have built a house\r\nwith only a stone ax in your tool kit, you'll think the rest of it is\r\nsimple.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe barricade, or _chevaux de frise_ as Chet insisted upon calling it,\r\nto show his deep study of the wars of earlier days, was built in the\r\nform of a U. The knoll itself sloped on one side directly to the water's\r\nedge: they had left that side open and carried their line of sharp\r\nstakes down to the water, that in the event of a siege they would not be\r\nconquered by thirst.\r\n\r\nOn the highest point of the knoll, some few weeks later, a house was\r\nbeing built--a more pretentious structure, this, than the other little\r\nhuts. The aerial roots that the white trees dropped from their\r\nhigh-flung branches were not impossible to cut with their crude\r\nimplements; they made good building material for a house whose framework\r\nmust be tied together with vines and tough roots. This would be the home\r\nof Harkness and Diane.\r\n\r\nThe two had been insistent that this structure would be incomplete\r\nwithout a room for Chet, but the pilot only laughed at that suggestion.\r\n\r\n\"It's an old saying,\" he told them, \"that one house isn't big enough for\r\ntwo families. I think the remark is as old as the institution of\r\nmarriage, just about. And it's as true on the Dark Moon as it is on\r\nEarth. And, besides, I intend to build some bachelor apartments that\r\nwill make this place of yours look pretty cheap, that is, if I ever find\r\ntime. I am going to be pretty busy just roaming around this little world\r\nseeing what I can see. Even Herr Kreiss has got the wanderlust, you will\r\nnotice.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has been gone four days,\" said Diane. Her tone was frankly worried.\r\nChet finished tying a sapling to a row of uprights and slid to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Don't be alarmed about Kreiss,\" he reassured her. \"He has been\r\nall-fired mysterious for the past several weeks. He's been working on\r\nsomething in that cave of his, and visitors have not been admitted. When\r\nhe left he told me he would be gone for some time, and he looked at me\r\nlike an owl when he said it: his mysterious secret was making his eyes\r\npop out. He has a surprise up his sleeve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wedding present for Diane,\" Harkness suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Well, he showed me some darn nice sapphires,\" Chet agreed. \"Probably\r\nfound some way to cut them and he's setting them in a bracelet of soft\r\ngold: that's my guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish he were here,\" Diane insisted.\r\n\r\nAnd Chet nodded across the clearing as he said fervently: \"I wish I\r\ncould get all my wishes as quickly as that. There he comes now with his\r\nbow in one hand and a bag of something in the other.\"\r\n\r\nThe tall figure moved wearily across the open ground, but straightened\r\nand came briskly toward them as he drew near. He seemed more gaunt than\r\nusual, as if he had finished a long journey and had slept but little.\r\nBut his eyes behind their heavy spectacles were big with pride.\r\n\r\n\"You have--what do you Americans say?--'poked fun' at my helplessness in\r\nthe forest,\" he told Chet. \"And now see. Alone and without help I have\r\nmade a great journey, a most important journey.\" He held up a bladder,\r\ntranslucent, filled with something palely green.\r\n\r\n\"The gas!\" he said proudly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Herr Kreiss,\" Diane exclaimed, amazed, \"you can't mean that you've\r\nbeen to Fire Valley; that that is the gas from about the ship!... And\r\nwhy did you want it? What earthly use....\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe had looked from the proud face of the scientist to that of Harkness;\r\nthen turned toward Chet. Her voice died away, her question unfinished,\r\nat sight of the expression in those other eyes.\r\n\r\n\"From--the ship? You mean that you've been there--Fire Valley? That\r\nyou've come back here?\" Chet was asking on behalf of Harkness as well:\r\nhis companion added nothing to the words of the pilot--words spoken in a\r\ncuriously quiet, strained tone.\r\n\r\n\"But yes!\" Herr Kreiss assured him. His gaze was still proudly fixed\r\nupon the bladder of green gas. \"I needed some for an experiment--a most\r\nimportant experiment.\" And not till then did he glance up and let his\r\nthin face wrinkle in amazed wonder at the look on the pilot's face.\r\n\r\nChet had raised one end of another stick as Kreiss approached. He had\r\nintended to place it against the frame they were building: it fell\r\nheavily to the ground instead. He regarded Harkness with eyes that were\r\nsomber with hopeless despair, yet that somehow crinkled with a whimsical\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I said he had a surprise up his sleeve,\" he reminded them. \"It is\r\nnearly night; I can't do anything now. I'll go to-morrow; take Towahg. I\r\ndon't know that there's anything we can do, but we'll try.\r\n\r\n\"You will stay here with Diane,\" he told Harkness. And Harkness accepted\r\nthe order as he would from one who was in command.\r\n\r\n\"It's up to you now,\" he told Chet. \"I'll stay here and hold the fort.\r\nYou're running the job from now on.\"\r\n\r\nBut the pilot only nodded. Herr Kreiss was sputtering a barrage of how's\r\nand why's; he demanded to know why his success in so hazardous a trip\r\nshould have this result.\r\n\r\nBut Chet Bullard did not answer. He walked slowly away, his eyes on the\r\nground, as one who is trying to plan; driving his thoughts in an effort\r\nto find some escape from a danger that seemed to hover threateningly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n_Terrors of the Jungle_\r\n\r\n\r\nTowahg had learned the names of these white-skinned ones who came down\r\nfrom whatever heaven was pictured in his rudimentary mind. His\r\npronunciation of them was peculiar: it had not been helped any by reason\r\nof Diane's having been his teacher. Her French accent was delightful to\r\nhear, but not helpful to a Dark Moon ape-man who was grappling with\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nBut he knew them by name, using always the French \"Monsieur,\" and when\r\nChet repeated: \"Monsieur Kreiss--he go,\" pointing through the jungle,\r\nand followed this with the command: \"Towahg go! Me go!\" the ape-man's\r\nunlovely face drew into its hideous grin and he nodded his head\r\nviolently to show that he understood.\r\n\r\nChet gripped a hand each if Harkness and Diane and clung to them for a\r\nmoment. Below their knoll the white morning mist drifted eerily toward\r\nthe lake; the knoll was an island and they three the only living\r\ncreatures in a living world. It was the first division of their little\r\nforce, the first parting where any such farewell might be the last. The\r\nsilence hung heavily about them.\r\n\r\n\"Au 'voir,\" Diane said softly; \"and take no chances. Come back here and\r\nwe'll win or lose together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blue skies,\" was Walt Harkness' good-by in the language of the flyer;\r\n\"blue skies and happy landings!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Chet, before the shrouding mist swallowed him up, replied in kind.\r\n\r\n\"Lifting off!\" he announced as if his ship were rising beneath him, \"and\r\nthe air is cleared. I'll drop back in four days if I'm lucky.\"\r\n\r\nTowahg was waiting, curled up for warmth in the hollow of a great tree's\r\nroots. Like all the ape-men he was sullen and taciturn in the chill of\r\nthe morning. Not until the sun warmed him would he become his customary\r\nself. But he grunted when Chet repeated his instructions, \"Monsieur\r\nKreiss, he go! Now Towahg go too--go where Monsieur Kreiss go!\" and he\r\nled the way into the jungle where the scientist had emerged.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet followed close through wraith-like, drifting mist. They were\r\nascending a gentle slope; among the trees and tangled giant vines the\r\nmist grew thin. Then they were above it, and occasional shafts of golden\r\nlight shot flatly in to mark the ascending sun.\r\n\r\nThey were climbing toward the big divide, that much Chet knew. White,\r\nghostly trees gave place to the darker, gloomier growth of the uplands.\r\nStrange monstrosities, they had been to Chet when first he had seen\r\nthem, but he was accustomed to them now and passed unnoticing among\r\ntheir rubbery trunks, so black and shining with morning dew.\r\n\r\nFar above a wind moved among the pliant branches that whipped and\r\nwhirled their elastic lengths into strange, curled forms. Then the\r\nmiracle of the daily growth of leaves took place, and the rubbery limbs\r\nwere clothed in green, where golden flowers budded prodigiously before\r\nthey flashed open and filled the wet air with their fragrance.\r\n\r\nThey were following the path that Chet had traveled on his morning trips\r\nto the divide for a view of the ship. Kreiss would have gone this way,\r\nof course, although to Chet, there was no sign of his having passed.\r\nThen came the divide, and still Chet followed where Towahg led sullenly\r\nacross the expanse of barren rocks. Towahg's head was sunk between his\r\nblack shoulders; his long arms hung limply; and he moved on with a\r\nsteady motion of his short, heavily muscled legs, with apparently no\r\nthought of where he went or why.\r\n\r\nChet stopped for a moment's look at the distant sparkle that meant the\r\nshining ship, which shone green as on every other day, and he wondered\r\nas he had a score of times if it might be possible for them to make a\r\nsuit--a bag to enclose his head, or a gas-mask--anything that could be\r\nmade gas-tight: and could be supplied with air. Then he thought of the\r\nbow that was slung on his shoulder and the stone ax at his belt. These\r\nwere their implements: these were all they had.... Suddenly he began to\r\nwalk rapidly down the slope after Towahg who was almost to the trees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain they were among the black rubbery growth. It rose from a tangle of\r\nmammoth leafed vines and creepers that wove themselves into an\r\nimpassable wall--impassable until Towahg lifted a huge leaf here, swung\r\na hanging vine there, and laid open a passage through the living\r\nlabyrinth.\r\n\r\n\"How did Kreiss ever find his way?\" Chet asked himself. And then he\r\nquestioned: \"Did he come this way? Is Towahg on the trail?\"\r\n\r\nAgain he repeated his instructions to the ape-man, and he showed his own\r\nwonder as to which way they should go.\r\n\r\nThe sun must have done its work effectively, for now Towahg's wide grin\r\nwas in evidence. He nodded vigorously, then dropped to one knee and\r\nmotioned for Chet to see for himself, as he pointed to his proof.\r\n\r\nChet stared at the unbroken ground. Was a tiny leaf crushed? It might\r\nhave been, but so were a thousand others that had fallen from above. He\r\nshook his head, and Towahg could only show his elation by hopping\r\nludicrously from one foot to the other in a dance of joy.\r\n\r\nThen he went on at a pace Chet found difficulty in following, until they\r\ncame to a place where Towahg tore a vine aside to show easier going, but\r\nclimbed instead over a fallen tree, grown thickly with vines, and here\r\neven Chet could see that other feet had tripped and stumbled. The Master\r\nPilot glanced at the triple star still pinned to his blouse; he thought\r\nof the study and training that had preceded the conferring of that\r\nrating, the charting of the stars, navigational problems in a\r\nthree-dimensional sea. And he smiled at his failure to read this trail\r\nthat to Towahg was entirely plain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Every man to his job,\" he told the black, and patted him on the\r\nshoulder, \"and you know yours, Towahg, you're good! Now, where do we\r\nsleep?\"\r\n\r\nHe ventured to suggest a bed of leaves that had gathered amongst a maze\r\nof great rocks, but Towahg registered violent disapproval. He pointed to\r\na pendant vine; his hands that were clumsy at so many things gave an\r\nunmistakable imitation of a bud that developed on that vine and opened.\r\nThen Towahg sniffed once at that imaginary flower, and his body went\r\nsuddenly limp and apparently lifeless as it fell to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"You're right, old top!\" Chet assured him, as Towahg came again to his\r\nfeet. \"This is no place to take a nap.\" A crashing of some enormous body\r\nthat tore the tough jungle in its rush came from beyond the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"And there are other reasons,\" he added as he followed Towahg's example\r\nand leaped for a hanging tangle of laced vines. Here was a ladder ready\r\nto take them to the high roof above, but they did not need it; the\r\ncrashing died away in the distance.\r\n\r\nIt was Chet's first intimation that this section of the Dark Moon held\r\nbeasts more huge than the \"Moon-pigs\" he had killed: it was a disturbing\r\nbit of knowledge. He caught Towahg's cautious, wary eyes and motioned\r\ntoward the branches high overhead.\r\n\r\n\"How about hanging ourselves up there for the night?\" he asked, and the\r\ngestures, though not the words, were plain, as the ape-man's quick\r\ndissent made clear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe motioned Chet to follow. Down they plunged, and always down. Towahg\r\ngave Chet to understand that Kreiss had slept some distance beyond: they\r\nwould try to reach the same place. But the quick-falling dusk caught\r\nthem while yet among the black rubbery trees. And the dark showed Chet\r\nwhy their branches might not be inviting as a sleeping place.\r\n\r\nBy ones and twos they came at first, occasional lines of light that\r\nflowed swiftly and vanished through the black tangle of limbs. Chet\r\ncould hardly believe them real; they appeared and were lost from sight\r\nas if they had melted.\r\n\r\nBut more came, and it seemed at last as if the roof above were alive\r\nwith light. The moving, luminous things glowed in hues that were never\r\nstill: were pure gold, were green, then red, melting and changing\r\nthrough all the colors of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nLiving fireworks that were a blaze of gorgeous beauty! They wove an\r\never-moving canopy of softest lights that raced dazzlingly to and fro,\r\nthat crossed and intertwined; that were dazing to his eyes while they\r\nheld his senses enthralled by their color and sheer loveliness ... until\r\none light detached itself and fell toward him where he stood spellbound\r\nbeside a giant fern.\r\n\r\nIt struck softly behind him, and its crimson glory flashed yellow as it\r\nstruck, then went black and in the dim light, on a great leathery leaf\r\nwith a spread of ten feet, Chet saw an enormous worm, whose head was a\r\nthing of writhing antennae, whose eyes were pure deadliness, and whose\r\nround corrugated body drew up the hanging part that the leaf could not\r\nhold. It hunched itself into a huge inverted U and, before Chet could\r\nrecover from his horrified surprise, was poised to spring.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was Towahg's strength, not his own, that threw him bodily down the\r\npath. It was Towahg who poured a volley of grunted words and shrieks\r\ninto his ear, while he dragged him back. Chet saw the vicious head flash\r\nto loveliest gold while it shot forward to the body's full twelve feet\r\nof length--twelve feet of pulsing lavender and rose and flashing crimson\r\nthat was more horrible by reason of its beauty.\r\n\r\nChet stumbled to his feet and raced after Towahg. The ape-man moved in\r\nswift silence, Chet close at his back. And other luminous horrors\r\ndropped on ropes of translucent silver behind them, until the ghostly\r\nwhite of friendly trees became visible, and they stood at last,\r\nbreathless and shaken, as far as Chet was concerned, in the familiar\r\njungle of the lower valleys.\r\n\r\nAnd Towahg, to whom poison vines and writhing, horrible worms of death\r\nthat had failed to make him their prey were things of a forgotten past,\r\ncurled up in the shelter of an outflung snarl of great roots, grunted\r\nonce, and went calmly to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut Chet Bullard, accustomed only to man-made dangers that would have\r\nheld Towahg petrified with fear, lay long, staring into the dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_Through Air and Water_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was midday when they approached the heights they had reached on their\r\nflight from Fire Valley. Off to one side must lie the arena with the\r\npyramid within. And within the pyramid--! Chet took his thoughts quickly\r\naway from that. Or perhaps it was the shrieking chatter from ahead that\r\ngave him other things to think of.\r\n\r\nTowahg had heard them before, but Chet had not understood his signs. And\r\nnow the chorus of an approaching pack of ape-men was louder with each\r\npassing minute. That they were coming along the same trail seemed\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\nTowahg sprang into the air; his gnarled hands closed on a heavy vine: he\r\nwent up this hand over hand, ready to move off to one side through the\r\nleafy roof with never a sign of his going. He waited impatiently for\r\nChet to join him, and the pilot, regarding the incredible leap of that\r\nsquat ape-man body, shook his head in despair.\r\n\r\n\"Grab a loose end,\" he told Towahg. \"Lower a rope--a vine. Get it down\r\nwhere I can reach it!\" And he raved inwardly at the blank look on the\r\nsavage face while he held himself in check and made signs over and over\r\nin an effort to get the idea across.\r\n\r\nTowahg got it at last. He lowered a vine and hauled Chet up with jerks\r\nthat almost tore the pilot's hands from their hold on the rough bark.\r\nThen off to one side! And they waited in the shelter of concealing\r\nleaves while the yelling pack drew near and a hundred or more of them\r\nraced by along the trail below.\r\n\r\nInvisible to Chet was the marked trail where Kreiss had gone, but these\r\nsavage things ran at top speed and read it as they ran.\r\n\r\nWere they puzzled by the sudden increase in markings? Did they sense\r\nthat some were more recent than those they had followed? Chet could not\r\nsay. But he saw the pack return, staring curiously about until they\r\nswung off and vanished through the trees toward the west. And in that\r\ndirection lay the arena and the haunt of a horror unknown.\r\n\r\nYet Chet lowered himself to the ground with steady hands and motioned\r\nTowahg where the yelling mob had gone.\r\n\r\n\"We'll go that way,\" he said; \"we'll follow them up. And perhaps, if I\r\ncan only get the idea into your thick head, we can learn what their\r\nplans are: find out if Kreiss has really thrown us in their hands--led\r\nthem as straight as a pack of wolves could run to the quiet peace of\r\nHappy Valley.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet might have followed them into the arena itself: he felt so keenly\r\nthat he must know with certainty whether or not the pack would continue\r\ntheir pursuit. And why had they turned back? he asked himself. Had they\r\nreturned to acquaint their horrible god and his hypnotised slaves with\r\nwhat they had learned?\r\n\r\nBut the trail turned off from the rocky waste where the arena lay; it\r\ntook them west and south for another mile, until again to Chet's ears\r\ncame the chattering bedlam of monkey-talk that was almost human. And now\r\nthey moved more cautiously from rock to tree and through the concealing\r\nshadows until they could look into a shallow valley ahead. But before\r\nChet looked he was prepared for a surprising scene. For over and above\r\nthe raucous calling of the ape-folk had come another deeper tone.\r\n\r\n\"_Gott im Himmel!_\" the deep voice said. \"One at a time, you _verdammt_\r\nbeasts. Beat them on the head, Max; make them shut up!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the big bulk of Schwartzmann, when Chet first saw him, was seated on\r\na high rock that was like a barbaric throne in a valley of green. About\r\nhim the ape-men leaped and grimaced and made futile animal efforts to\r\ntell him of their discovery.\r\n\r\n\"They've found something, Max,\" Schwartzmann said to his pilot. \"Get the\r\nother two men. We'll go with the dirty brutes. And if they've got wind\r\nof those others--\" His remarks concluded with a sputtering of profanity\r\nwhose nature was not obscured by its being given in another language.\r\nAnd Chet knew that the obscenities were intended for his companions and\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann's booming voice came plainly even above the chorus of\r\ncoughing growls and shriller chatter. Chet saw him showing his detonite\r\npistol in a half-threatening motion, and the ape-men cringed away in\r\nfear.\r\n\r\n\"Not so well trained an army, Max, that I am general of, but if we find\r\nthat man, Harkness, and his pilot and that traitor Kreiss, we will let\r\nthese soldiers of mine tear them to little bits. Now, we go!\"\r\n\r\nMax's call had brought the other two men of Schwartzmann's party, and\r\nthe black horde of ape-men broke into a wild run across the grass toward\r\nthe place where Chet and Towahg lay. The two slipped hurriedly into the\r\nconcealment of denser growth, then ran at top speed down a jungle trail\r\nthat led off to one side.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were bedded down for the night on the edge of the white forest; no\r\npersuasion of Schwartzmann's would have driven the ape-men into the\r\ndarkness of the black trees and their flashing, luminous worm-beasts.\r\nChet and Towahg came within hearing of their encampment just at dusk,\r\nand a late-rising moon broke through the gaps in the leafy roof to make\r\nsplotched islands of gold in the velvet dark where Chet and Towahg\r\nfought the jungle so they might swing around and past the camp.\r\nOccasional grunts and scufflings showed that the ape-men were restless,\r\nand the two knew that every step must be taken in silence and every\r\nobstructing leaf moved with no rasping friction on other leaves or\r\nbranches. But they came again to the trail, and now they were ahead of\r\nthe pack, as the first gray light of dawn was stealing through the\r\nghostly white of the trees.\r\n\r\nTowahg would have curled himself into a sleepy ball a score of times had\r\nChet not driven him on, and now the pilot only allowed a few minutes for\r\nfood, where ripe purple fruit hung in clusters on the end of stems that\r\nwere like ropes.\r\n\r\nNo use to explain to Towahg. Perhaps the ape-man thought they were\r\nhurrying to get through the black forest; he might even have thought the\r\nmatter through to see the necessity for reaching their own valley and\r\nwarning the others. Certainly he had no idea of any plans other than\r\nthese, and he must have been puzzled some several hours later when Chet\r\nhalted where the trail had crossed a barren expanse of rock.\r\n\r\nTowahg had stopped there on the way down. Then he had sniffed the air,\r\ndropped his head low and circled about, motioning Chet to follow, from\r\nacross the clearing where he had picked up the trail. Chet knew the\r\nape-men would do the same unless they were diverted, and he had a plan.\r\nTo communicate it to his assistant was his greatest problem.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe stopped at the clearing, while Towahg urged him on across the smooth\r\nrock. Chet shook his head and pointed away from the direction of the big\r\ndivide, and at last he made him understand. Then Towahg did what Chet\r\nnever could have done.\r\n\r\nHe followed their former trail across the stone, his head close to the\r\nground. Now he picked a bruised leaf: again he replaced a turned stone\r\nwhose markings showed it had been displaced, and he came back over an\r\narea that even an ape-man would not follow as being a place where men\r\nhad gone.\r\n\r\nFrom where they emerged he turned as Chet had pointed, crossed the\r\nclearing as clumsily as the German scientist might have done, scuffed\r\nhis bare feet in a pocket of gravel, and pointed to soft earth where\r\nChet might walk and leave a mark of shoes. Chet grinned happily while\r\nTowahg did his grotesque dance that indicated satisfaction, though from\r\nafar the first cries of the pack rang in the air.\r\n\r\nThey could never have outdistanced the apes alone, Chet knew that. But\r\nhe also knew that Schwartzmann and the others would slow them up, and he\r\ncounted on the pack staying together on the trail as they traversed this\r\nnew country. He entered the jungle with Towahg where their new trail\r\nled, and drove his tired muscles to greater speed while Towahg, always\r\nin the lead, motioned him on.\r\n\r\nThere were stops for food at times until another night came, and Chet\r\nthrew himself down on a mat of grass and fell instantly asleep. If there\r\nwas danger abroad he neither knew nor cared. He knew only that every\r\nmuscle of his body was aching from the forced march, and that Towahg's\r\ntwitching ears were on guard.\r\n\r\nThe following day they went more slowly, stopping at times to wait for\r\nthe sounds of pursuit. They were leading the pack on a long journey;\r\nChet wanted to be sure they were following and had not turned back. He\r\nleft a plain mark of his boot from time to time, and knew that this mark\r\nwould be shown to Schwartzmann. With that to lead him there would be no\r\nstopping the man: he would drive his army of blacks despite their\r\nsuperstitious fears.\r\n\r\nThe short days and nights formed an endless succession to Chet. Only\r\nonce did he see a familiar place, as they passed a valley and he saw\r\nwhere their ship had rested on that earlier voyage.\r\n\r\n\"This is far enough,\" he told Towahg, and made himself plain with signs.\r\n\"Now we'll lose them; hang them right up in the air and leave them\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\nAnother steep climb and a valley beyond, and in the hollow a tumbling\r\nstream. There was no need to tell Towahg what to do, for he led straight\r\nfor the water, and his thick legs churned through it as he headed down\r\nstream; nor did he stop until they had covered many miles.\r\n\r\nChet had wondered how they would leave the water without trace, but\r\nagain Towahg was ready. A stone where the water splashed would show no\r\nmark of bare feet. From it he leaped into the air toward a swaying vine.\r\nHe missed, tried again, and finally grasped it. And the rest was a\r\nrepetition of what had been done before.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe lowered a vine as Chet had taught him, pulled the slim figure of Chet\r\nup to the dizzy heights of the jungle trees, then took Chet's one arm in\r\na grip of chilled steel and threw him across his back, while he swung\r\nsickeningly from limb to limb, up through the branches of another\r\ngrotesque tree where its queerly distorted limbs sagged and swung them\r\nto its fellow some fifty feet away.\r\n\r\nIt was a wild ride for the pilot. \"I've driven everything that's made\r\nwith an engine in it,\" he told himself, \"but this one-ape-power craft\r\nhas them all stopped for thrills.\"\r\n\r\nAnd at last when even Towahg's chest that seemed ribbed with steel, was\r\nrising and falling with his great breaths, Chet found himself set down\r\non the ground, and he patted the black on the shoulder in the gesture\r\nthat meant approval.\r\n\r\n\"Water and air,\" he said; \"it'll bother them to trail us over that\r\nroute. Towahg, you're there when it comes to trapeze work. Now, if you\r\ncan find the way back again--!\"\r\n\r\nAnd Towahg could, as Chet admitted when, after a series of eventless\r\ndays, they came again to the big divide above the reaches of Happy\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nAnd the grip of Harkness' hand, and the tears in Diane's eyes brought a\r\nchoke to his throat until the voluble apologies of a penitent Herr\r\nKreiss and the antics of a Towahg, recipient of many approving pats,\r\nturned the emotion into the safer channel of laughter.\r\n\r\n\"But I think we switched them off for good,\" Chet said, in conclusion of\r\nhis recital; \"I believe we are as safe as we ever were. And I've only\r\none big regret:\r\n\r\n\"If I could just have been around somewhere when friend Schwartzmann\r\nfound his scouts had led him up a blind alley, it would have been worth\r\nthe trip. He did pretty well when he started cussing us out before; I'll\r\nbet he pumped his vocabulary dry on them this time.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_Hunted Down_\r\n\r\n\r\nWork on the house was resumed. \"And when it is done,\" said Diane with a\r\ngay laugh, \"Walter and I shall have our wedding day. Now you see why you\r\nwere wanted so badly, Chet; it was not that we worried for you, but only\r\nthat we feared the loss of the one person on the Dark Moon who could\r\nperform a marriage ceremony.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I thought all along it was my clever carpenter work that had\r\ncaptivated you,\" responded Chet, and tried to fit the splintered end of\r\na timber into a forked branch that made an upright post.\r\n\r\nAnd each day the house took form, while the sun shone down with tropical\r\nwarmth where the work was going on.\r\n\r\nOnly Harkness and Chet were the builders. Diane's strength was not equal\r\nto the task of cutting tough wood with a crude stone ax, and Herr\r\nKreiss, though willing enough to help when asked, was usually in his own\r\ncave, busied with mysterious experiments of which he would tell nothing.\r\n\r\nTowahg, their only remaining Helper, could not be held. Too wild for\r\nrestraint of any kind, he would vanish into the jungle at break of day\r\nto reappear now and then as silently as a black shadow. But he kept them\r\nall supplied with game and fruit and succulent roots which his wilder\r\nbrethren of the forest must have shown him were fit for food.\r\n\r\nAnd then came an interruption that checked the work on the house, that\r\ndrained the brilliant sunshine of its warmth and light, and turned all\r\nthoughts to the question of defense.\r\n\r\nThe two had been working on the roof, while Diane had returned to the\r\njungle for another of the big leaves. She carried her bow on such trips,\r\nalthough the weeks had brought them a sense of security. But for Chet\r\nthis feeling of safety vanished in the instant that he heard Harkness'\r\nhalf-uttered exclamation and saw him drop quickly to the ground.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeyond him, coming through the green smother of grass that was now as\r\nhigh as her waist, was Diane. Even at a distance Chet could see the\r\nunnatural paleness of her face; she was running fast, coming along the\r\ntrail they had all helped to make.\r\n\r\nChet hit the ground on all fours and reached for the long bow with which\r\nhe had become so expert; then followed Harkness who was racing to meet\r\nthe girl.\r\n\r\n\"An ape!\" she was saying between choking breaths when Chet reached them.\r\n\"An ape-man!\" She was clinging to Harkness in utter fright that was\r\nunlike the Diane he had known.\r\n\r\n\"Towahg,\" Harkness suggested; \"you saw Towahg!\" But the girl shook her\r\nhead. She was recovering something of her normal poise; her breath came\r\nmore evenly.\r\n\r\n\"No! It was not Towahg. I saw it. I was hidden under the big leaves. It\r\nwas an ape-man. He came swinging along through the branches of the\r\ntrees: he was up high and he looked in all directions. I ran. I think he\r\ndid not see me.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" she confessed, \"I am ashamed. I thought I had forgotten the\r\nhorror of that experience, but this brought it all back.... There! I am\r\nall right now.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness held her tenderly close. \"Frightened,\" he reassured her, \"and\r\nno wonder! That night on the pyramid left its mark on us all. Now, come;\r\ncome quietly.\"\r\n\r\nHe was leading the girl toward the knoll that they all called home. Chet\r\nfollowed, casting frequent glances toward the trees. They had covered\r\nhalf the distance to the barricade when Chet spoke in a voice that was\r\nhalf a whisper in its hushed tenseness.\r\n\r\n\"Drop--quick!\" he ordered. \"Get into the grass. It's coming. Now let's\r\nsee what it is.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe knew that the others had taken cover. For himself, he had flung his\r\nlanky figure into the tall grass. The bow was beside him, an arrow\r\nready; and the tip of polished bone and the feathered shaft made it a\r\nweapon that was not one to be disregarded. Long hours of practice had\r\ndeveloped his natural aptitude into real skill. Before him, he parted\r\nthe tall grass cautiously to see the forest whence the sound had come.\r\n\r\nThe swish of leaves had warned Chet; some far-flung branch must have\r\nfailed to bear the big beast's weight and had bent to swing him to the\r\nground--or perhaps the descent was intentional.\r\n\r\nAnd now there was silence, the silence of noonday that is so filled with\r\nunheard summer sounds. A foot above Chet's head a tiny bat-winged bird\r\nrocked and tilted on vermilion leather wings, while its iridescent head\r\nmade flickering rainbow colors with the vibrations of a throat that\r\nhummed a steady call. Across the meadow were countless other flashing,\r\nhumming things, like dust specks dancing in the sun, but magnified and\r\nintensely colored.\r\n\r\nAbove their droning note was the shrill cry of the insects that spent\r\ntheir days in idle and ceaseless unmusical scrapings. They inhabited the\r\nshadowed zone along the forest edge. And now, where the foliage of the\r\ntowering trees was torn back in a great arch, the insect shrilling\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nAs the strings of a harp are damped and silenced in unison, their myriad\r\nvoices ended that shrill note in the same instant. The silence spread;\r\nthere was a hush as if all living things were mute in dread expectancy\r\nof something as yet unseen.\r\n\r\nChet was watching that arched opening. In one instant, except for the\r\nflickering shadows, it was empty; the place was so still it might have\r\nbeen lifeless since the dawn of time. And then--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet neither saw nor heard him come. He was there--a hulking hairy\r\nfigure that came in absolute silence despite his huge weight.\r\n\r\nAn ape-man larger than any Chet had seen: he stood as motionless as an\r\nexhibit in a museum in some city of a far-off Earth. Only the white of\r\nhis eyeballs moved as the little eyes, under their beetling black brows,\r\ndarted swiftly about.\r\n\r\n\"Bad!\" thought Chet. \"Damn bad!\" If this was an advance scout for a pick\r\nof great monsters like himself it meant an assault their own little\r\nforce could never meet. And this newcomer was hostile. There was not the\r\nleast doubt of that.\r\n\r\nChet reached one hand behind him to motion for silence; one of his\r\ncompanions had stirred, had moved the grass in a ripple that was not\r\nthat of the wind. Chet held his hand rigid in air, his whole body\r\nseeming to freeze with a premonition that was pure horror; and within\r\nhim was a voice that said with dreadful certainty: \"They have found you.\r\nThey have hunted you down.\"\r\n\r\nFor the thing in the forest, the creature half-human, half-beast, had\r\nraised its two shaggy arms before it; and, with eyes fixed and staring,\r\nit was walking straight toward them, walking as no other living thing\r\nhad walked, but one. Chet was seeing again that one--a helplessly\r\nhypnotized ape that appeared from a pit in a great pyramid. And the\r\nvoice within him repeated hopelessly: \"They have found you. They have\r\nrun you down.\"\r\n\r\nChet lay motionless. He still hoped that the dread messenger might pass\r\nthem by, but the rigidly outstretched arms were extended straight toward\r\nhim; the creature's short, heavily muscled legs were moving stiffly,\r\ntearing a path through the thick grass and bringing him nearer with\r\nevery step.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDiane and Harkness had been a few paces in advance of Chet when they\r\ndropped into the concealing grass. Chet could see where they lay, and\r\nthe ape-man, as he approached, turned off as if he had lost the\r\ndirection. He passed Chet by, passed where Walt and Diane were hiding\r\nand stopped! And Chet saw the glazed eyes turn here and there about\r\ntheir peaceful valley.\r\n\r\nUnseeing they seemed, but again Chet knew better. Was he more\r\nsensitively attuned than the others? Who could say? But again he caught\r\na message as plainly as if the words had been shouted inside his brain.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the valley of the three sentinel peaks and the lake of blue; we\r\ncan find it again. Houses, shelters--how crudely they build, these\r\nwhite-faced intruders!\" Chet even sensed the contempt that accompanied\r\nthe thoughts. \"That is enough; you have done well. You shall have their\r\nraw hearts for your reward. Now bring them in--bring them in quickly!\"\r\n\r\nThe instant action that followed this command was something Chet would\r\nnever have believed possible had his own eyes not seen the incredible\r\nleap of the huge body. The ape-man's knotted muscles hurled him through\r\nthe air directly toward the spot where Walt and Diane were hidden. But,\r\nhad Chet been able to stand off and observe himself, he might have been\r\nequally amazed at the sight of a man who leaped erect, who raised a long\r\nbow, fitted an arrow, drew it to his shoulder, and did all in the\r\ninstant while the huge brute's body was in the air.\r\n\r\nThe great ape landed on all fours. When he straightened and stood\r\nerect--his arms were extended, and in each of his gnarled hands he held\r\na figure that was helpless in that terrible grasp.\r\n\r\nNo chance to loose the arrow then, though the brute's back was half\r\nturned. He had Harkness and Diane by their throats, and Chet knew by the\r\nunresisting limpness of Harkness' body that the fearful fire in those\r\nblazing eyes had them in a grip even more deadly than the hands of the\r\nbeast.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThoughts were flashing wildly through Chet's brain. \"Knocked 'em cold!\r\nHe'll do the same to me if I meet his eyes. But I can't shoot now;\r\nDiane's in line. I must take him face about; get him before he gets\r\nme--get him first time!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, confusedly, there were other thoughts mingled with his\r\nown--thoughts he was picking up by means of a nervous system that was\r\nlike an aerial antenna:\r\n\r\n\"Good--good! No--do not kill them. Not now; bring them to us alive. The\r\npleasure will come later. And where are the other two? Find them!\" It\r\nwas here that Chet let out a wordless, blood-curdling shriek from lungs\r\nand throat that were tight with breathless waiting.\r\n\r\nHe must face the big brute about, and his wild yell did the work.\r\nStartled by that cry that must have reached even those calloused, savage\r\nnerves, the ape-man leaped straight up in the air. He whirled as he\r\nsprang, to face whatever was behind him, and he threw the bodies of\r\nHarkness and Diane to the ground.\r\n\r\nChet saw the black ugliness of the face; he saw the eyes swing toward\r\nhim.... But he was following with his own narrowed eyes a spot on a\r\nhairy throat; he even seemed to see within it where a great carotid\r\nartery carried pumping blood to an undeveloped brain.\r\n\r\nThe glare of those eyes struck him like a blow: his own were drawn\r\nirresistibly into that meeting of glances that would freeze him to a\r\nrigid statue--but the twang and snap of his own bowstring was in his\r\nears, and a hairy body, its throat pierced in mid-air, was falling\r\nheavily to the ground.\r\n\r\nBut Chet Bullard, even as he leaped to the side of his companions, was\r\nthinking not of his victory, nor even of the two whose lives he had\r\nsaved. He was thinking of some horror that his mind could not clearly\r\npicture: it had found them; it had seen them through this ape-man's eyes\r\nbefore the arrow had closed them in death ... and from now on there\r\ncould not be two consecutive minutes of peace and happiness in this\r\nHappy Valley of Diane's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n_Besieged!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I've felt it for some time,\" Chet confessed. \"I've wakened and known I\r\nhad been dreaming about that damnable thing. And, although it sounds\r\nlike the wildest sort of insanity, I have felt that there was\r\nsomething--some mental force--that was reaching out for our minds;\r\nsearching for us. Well, if there is anything like that--\"\r\n\r\nHe was about to say that the trail made by Kreiss and the apes who\r\ntracked him would have given this other enemy a direction to follow, but\r\nKreiss himself dropped down beside Chet where he and Walt sat before the\r\nfront of Diane's shelter. The pilot did not finish the sentence. Kreiss\r\nhad meant it for the best; there was no use of rubbing it in. But that\r\nthing in the pyramid would never be fooled as Schwartzmann and the apes\r\nhad been.\r\n\r\nChet had told Kreiss of the attack and had shown him the body of the\r\nape-man. \"Council of war,\" he explained as Kreiss rejoined them, but he\r\ncorrected himself at once. \"No--not war! We don't want to go up against\r\nthat bunch. Our job is to plan a retreat.\"\r\n\r\nHarkness turned to look inside the hut. \"Diane, old girl,\" he asked,\r\n\"how about it? Are you going to be able to make a long trip?\"\r\n\r\nWithin the shelter Chet could see Diane's hands drawn into two hard\r\nlittle fists. She would force those tight hands to relax while she lay\r\nquietly in the dark; then again they would tremble, and, unconsciously,\r\nthe nervous tension would be manifested in those white-knuckled little\r\nfists. For all of them the shock had been severe; it was hardest on\r\nDiane.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe answered now in a voice whose very quietness belied her brave words.\r\n\r\n\"Any time--any place!\" she told Walt. \"And--and the farther we go the\r\nbetter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite right,\" Harkness agreed. \"I am satisfied that there is something\r\nthere we can never combat. We don't know what it is, and God help anyone\r\nwho ever finds out. How about it, Chet? And you, too, Kreiss? Do you\r\nagree that there is no use in staying here and trying to fight it out?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not agree,\" the scientist objected. \"My work, my experiments I\r\nhave collected! Would you have me abandon them? Must we run in fear\r\nbecause an anthropoid ape has come into this clearing? And, if there are\r\nmore, we have our barricade; our weapons are crude, but effective, and I\r\nmight add to them with some ideas of my own should occasion demand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen!\" Chet commanded. \"That anthropoid ape is nothing to be afraid\r\nof: you're right on that. But he came from the pyramid, Kreiss, and\r\nthere's something there that knows every foot of ground that messenger\r\nwent over. There's something in that pyramid that can send more ape-men,\r\nthat can come itself, for all that I know, and that can knock us cold in\r\nhalf a second.\r\n\r\n\"It's found us. One arrow went straight, thank God! It has given us a\r\nstay of execution. But is that damnable thing in the pyramid going to\r\nlet it go at that? You know the answer as well as I do. It has probably\r\nsent twenty more of those messengers who are on their way this minute, I\r\nam telling you; and we've got two days at the most before they get\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nKreiss still protested. \"But my work--\"\r\n\r\n\"Is ended!\" snapped Chet. \"Stay if you want to; you'll never finish your\r\nwork. The rest of us will leave in the morning. Towahg will be back here\r\nto-night.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing much to get together,\" he told Harkness. \"I'll see to it; you\r\nstay with Diane.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTheir bows, a store of extra bone-tipped arrows, and food: as Chet had\r\nsaid there was not much to prepare for their flight. They had spent many\r\nhours in arrow making: there were bundles of them stored away in\r\nreadiness for an attack, and Chet looked at them with regret, but knew\r\nthey must travel fast and light.\r\n\r\nOut of his rocky \"laboratory\" Kreiss came at dusk to tramp slowly and\r\nmoodily down to the shelters.\r\n\r\n\"I shall leave when you do,\" he told Chet. \"Perhaps we can find some\r\nplace, some corner of this world, where we can live in peace. But I had\r\nhoped, I had thought--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" Chet queried. \"What did you have on your mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"The gas,\" the scientist replied. \"I was working with a rubber latex. I\r\nhad thought to make a mask, improvise an air-pump and send one of us\r\nthrough the green gas to reach the ship. And there was more that I hoped\r\nto do; but, as you say, my work is ended.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bully for you,\" said Chet admiringly; \"the old bean keeps right on\r\nworking all the time. Well, you may do it yet; we may come back to the\r\nship. Who can tell? But just now I am more anxious about Towahg. Right\r\nnow, when we need him the most, he fails to show up.\"\r\n\r\nThe ape-man was seldom seen by day, but always he came back before\r\nnightfall; his chunky figure was a familiar sight as he slipped\r\nsoundlessly from the jungle where the shadows of approaching night lay\r\nfirst. But now Chet watched in vain at the arched entrance to the leafy\r\ntangle. He even ventured, after dark, within the jungle's edge and\r\ncalled and hallooed without response. And this night the hours dragged\r\nby where Chet lay awake, watching and listening for some sign of their\r\nguide.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen dawn, and golden arrows of light that drove the morning mist in\r\nlazy whirls above the surface of the lake. But no silent shadow-form\r\ncame from among the distant trees. And without Towahg--!\r\n\r\n\"Might as well stay here and take it standing,\" was Chet's verdict, and\r\nHarkness nodded assent.\r\n\r\n\"Not a chance,\" he agreed. \"We might make our way through the forest\r\nafter a fashion, but we would be slow doing it, and the brutes would be\r\nafter us, of course.\"\r\n\r\nThey made all possible preparations to withstand a siege. Chet, after a\r\ncareful, listening reconnaissance, went into the jungle with bow and\r\narrows, and he came back with three of the beasts he had called\r\nMoon-pigs. Other trips, with Kreiss as an assistant, resulted in a great\r\nheap of fruit that they placed carefully in the shade of a hut. Water\r\nthey had in unlimited supply.\r\n\r\nHow they would stand off an enemy who fought only with the terrible\r\ngleam of their eyes no one of them could have said. But they all worked,\r\nand Diane helped, too, to place extra bows at points where they might be\r\nneeded and to put handfuls of arrows at the firing platforms spaced at\r\nregular intervals along the barricade.\r\n\r\nChet smiled sardonically as he saw Herr Kreiss laboring mightily and\r\nalone to rig a catapult that could be turned to face in all directions.\r\nBut he helped to bring in a supply of round stones from a distance down\r\nthe shore, though the picture of this medieval weapon being effective\r\nagainst those broadsides of mental force was not one his mind could\r\neasily paint.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd then Towahg came! Not the silent, swiftly-leaping figure that moved\r\non muscles like coiled steel springs! This was another Towahg who\r\ndragged a bruised body through the grass until Harkness and Chet reached\r\nhim and helped him to the barricade.\r\n\r\n\"Gr-r-ranga!\" he growled. It was the sound he had made before when he\r\nhad seen or had tried to tell them of the ape-men. \"Gr-r-ranga!\r\nGr-r-ranga!\" He pointed about him as if to say: \"There!--and there!--and\r\nthere!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\" Chet assured him. \"We understand: you met up with a pack of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon Towahg, with his monkey mimicry, gave a convincing\r\ndemonstration of himself being seized and beaten: and the tooth-marks on\r\nnearly every inch of his body gave proof of the rough reception he had\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nThen he showed himself escaping, running, swinging through trees, till\r\nhe came to the camp. And now he raised his bruised body to a standing\r\nposition and motioned them toward the forest.\r\n\r\n\"Gr-r-ranga come!\" he warned them, and repeated it over again, while his\r\nface wrinkled in fear that told plainly of the danger he had seen.\r\n\r\nChet glanced at Harkness and knew his own gaze was as disconsolate as\r\nhis companion's. \"He's met up with them,\" he admitted, \"though, for the\r\nlife of me, I can't see how he ever got away if it was a crowd of\r\nmessenger-apes who could petrify him with one look. There's something\r\nstrange about that, but whatever it is, here's our guide in no shape to\r\ntravel.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTowahg was growling and grimacing in an earnest effort to communicate\r\nsome idea. His few words and the full power of his mimicry had been used\r\nto urge them on, to warn them that they must flee for their lives, but\r\nit seemed he had something else to tell. Suddenly he leaped into his\r\ngrotesque dance, though his wounds must have made it an agonizing\r\neffort, but his joy in the thought that had come to him was too great to\r\ntake quietly. He knew how to tell Chet!\r\n\r\nAnd with a protruded stomach he marched before them as a well-fed German\r\nmight walk, and he stroked at an imaginary beard in reproduction of an\r\nact that was habitual with one they had known.\r\n\r\n\"Schwartzmann?\" asked Chet. He had used the name before when he and\r\nTowahg had led their enemy's \"army\" off the trail. \"You have seen\r\nSchwartzmann?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Towahg leaped and capered with delight. \"Szhwarr!\" he growled in an\r\neffort to pronounce the name; \"Szhwarr come!\"\r\n\r\nChet made a wild leap for their bows and supplies.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\" he shouted. \"That's the answer. It isn't the ones from the\r\npyramid; they're coming later. It's Schwartzmann and his bunch of apes.\r\nThey've followed the messenger, they're on their way, and, in spite of\r\nhis being all chewed up, Towahg can travel faster than that crowd. He'll\r\nguide us out of this yet!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was thrusting bundles of supplies--food, arrows, bows--into the eager\r\nhands of the others, while Towahg alternately licked his wounds and\r\ndanced about with excitement. Diane's voice broke in upon the tense\r\nhaste and bustle of the moment. She spoke quietly--her tone was flat,\r\nalmost emotionless--yet there was a quality that made Chet drop what he\r\nwas holding and reach for a bow.\r\n\r\n\"We can't go,\" Diane was saying; \"we can't go. Poor Towahg! He couldn't\r\ntell us how close they were on his trail; he hurried us all he could.\"\r\n\r\nChet saw her hand raised; he followed with his eyes the finger that\r\npointed toward the jungle, and he saw as had Diane the flick of moving\r\nleaves where black faces showed silently for an instant and then\r\nvanished. They were up in the trees--lower--down on the ground. There\r\nwere scores upon scores of the ape-men spying upon them, watching every\r\nmove that they made.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly, across the open ground, where the high-flung branches made\r\nthe great arch that they called the entrance, a ragged figure appeared.\r\nThe figure of a man whose torn clothes fluttered in the breeze, whose\r\nface was black with an unkempt beard, whose thick hand waved to motion\r\nother scarecrow figures to him, and who laughed, loudly and derisively\r\nthat the three quiet men and the girl on the knoll might hear.\r\n\r\n\"_Guten tag, meine Herrschaften_,\" Schwartzmann called loudly, \"_meine\r\nsehr geehrten Herrschaften!_ You must not be so exclusive. Many _guten_\r\nfriends haff I here with me. I haff been looking forward to this time\r\nwhen they would meet you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\"_One for Each of Us_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFor men who had come from a world where wars and warfare were things of\r\nthe past, Chet, and Harkness had done effective work in preparing a\r\ndefense. The knoll made a height of land that any military man would\r\nhave chosen to defend, and the top of the gentle slope was protected by\r\nthe barricade.\r\n\r\nOn each side of the inverted U that ended at the water's edge an opening\r\nhad been left, where they passed in and out. But even here the wall had\r\nbeen doubled and carried past itself: no place was left for an easy\r\nassault, and on the open end the water was their protection.\r\n\r\nWithin the barricade, at about the center, the top of the knoll showed\r\nan outcrop of rocks that rose high enough to be exposed to fire from\r\noutside, but their little shelters were on nearly level ground at the\r\nbase of the rocks. The whole enclosure was some thirty feet in width and\r\nperhaps a hundred feet long. Plenty to protect in case of an attack, as\r\nChet had remarked, but it could not have been much smaller and have done\r\nits work effectively.\r\n\r\nThere was no one of the four white persons but gave unspoken thanks for\r\nthe barricade of sharp stakes, and even Towahg, although his fangs were\r\nbared in an animal snarl at the sound of Schwartzmann's voice, must have\r\nbeen glad to keep his bruised body out of sight behind the sheltering\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nNo one of them replied to Schwartzmann's taunt. Harkness wrinkled his\r\neyes to stare through the bright sunlight and see the pistol in the\r\nman's belt.\r\n\r\n\"He still has it,\" he said, half to himself: \"he's got the gun. I was\r\nrather hoping something might have happened to it. Just one gun; but he\r\nhas plenty of ammunition--\"\r\n\r\n\"And we haven't--\" It was Chet, now, who seemed thinking aloud. \"But, I\r\nwonder--can we bluff him a bit?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe dropped behind the barricade and crawled into one of the huts to come\r\nout with three extra pistols clutched in his hand. Empty, of course, but\r\nthey had brought them with them with some faint hope that some day the\r\nship might be reached and ammunition secured. Chet handed one to Diane\r\nand another to Kreiss; the third weapon he stuck in his own belt where\r\nit would show plainly. Harkness was already armed.\r\n\r\n\"Now let's get up where they can see us,\" was Chet's answer to their\r\nwondering looks; \"let's show off our armament. How can he know how much\r\nammunition we have left? For that matter, he may be getting a little\r\nshort of shells himself, and he won't know that his solitary pistol is\r\nthe thing we are most afraid of.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" Harkness agreed; \"we will play a little good old-fashioned poker\r\nwith the gentleman, but don't overdo it, just casually let him see the\r\nguns.\"\r\n\r\nSchwartzmann, far across the open ground, must have seen them as plainly\r\nas they saw him as they climbed the little hummock of rocks. He could\r\nnot fail to note the pistols in the men's belts, nor overlook the\r\nsignificance of the weapon that gleamed brightly in the pilot's hand.\r\nChet saw him return his pistol to his belt as he backed slowly into the\r\nshadows, and he knew that Schwartzmann had no wish for an exchange of\r\nshots, even at long range, with so many guns against him. But from their\r\nslight elevation he saw something else.\r\n\r\nThe grass was trampled flat all about their enclosure, but, beyond, it\r\nstood half the height of a man; it was a sea of rippling green where the\r\nlight wind brushed across it. And throughout that sea that intervened\r\nbetween them and the jungle Chet saw other ripples forming, little\r\nquiverings of shaken stalks that came here and there until the whole\r\nexpanse seemed trembling.\r\n\r\n\"Down--and get ready for trouble!\" he ordered crisply, then added as he\r\nsprang for his own long bow: \"Their commanding officer doesn't want to\r\nmix it with us--not just yet--but the rest are coming, and there's a\r\nmillion of them, it looks like.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe apes broke cover with all the suddenness of a covey of quail, but\r\nthey charged like wild, hungry beasts that have sighted prey. Only the\r\nlong spears in their bunchy fists and the shorter throwing spears that\r\ncame through the air marked them as primitive men.\r\n\r\nThe standing grass at the end of the clearing beyond their barricade was\r\nabruptly black with naked bodies. To Chet, that charging horde was a\r\nformless dark wave that came rolling up toward them; then, as suddenly\r\nas the black wave had appeared, it ceased to be a mere mass and Chet saw\r\nindividual units. A black-haired one was springing in advance. The man\r\nbehind the barricade heard the twang of his bow as if it were a sound\r\nfrom afar off; but he saw the arrow projecting from a barrel-shaped\r\nchest, and the ape-man tottering over.\r\n\r\nHe loosed his arrows as rapidly as he could draw the bow; he knew that\r\nothers were shooting too. Where naked feet were stumbling over prostrate\r\nbodies the black wave broke in confusion and came on unsteadily into the\r\nhail of winged barbs.\r\n\r\nBut the wave rushed on and up to the barricade in a scattering of\r\nshrieking, leaping ape-man, and Chet spared a second for unspoken thanks\r\nfor the height of the barrier. A full six feet it stood from the ground,\r\nand the ends that had been burned, then pointed with a crude ax, were\r\naimed outward. Inside the enclosure Chet had wanted to throw up a bench\r\nor mound of earth on which they could stand to fire above the high\r\nbarrier, but lack of tools had prevented them. Instead they had laid\r\ncribbing of short poles at intervals and on each of these had built a\r\nplatform of branches.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nClose to the barricade of poles and vines, these platforms enabled the\r\ndefenders to shield themselves from thrown spears and rise as they\r\nwished to fire out and down into the mob. But with the rush of a score\r\nor more of the man-beasts to the barricade itself, Chet suddenly knew\r\nthat they were vulnerable to an attack with long lances.\r\n\r\nA leaping body was hanging on the barrier; huge hands tore and clawed at\r\nthe inner side for a grip. From the platform where Diane stood came an\r\narrow at the same instant Chet shot. One matched the other for accuracy,\r\nand the clawing figure fell limply from sight. But there were\r\nothers--and a lance tipped with the jagged fin, needle-sharp, of a\r\npoison fish was thrusting wickedly toward Diane.\r\n\r\nThis time Harkness' arrow did the work, but Chet ordered a retreat.\r\nAbove the pandemonium of snarling growls, he shouted.\r\n\r\n\"Back to the rocks, Walt,\" he ordered; \"you and Diane! Quick! The rest\r\nof us will hold 'em till you are ready. Then you keep 'em off until we\r\ncome!\" And the two obeyed the cool, crisp voice that was interrupted\r\nonly when its owner, with the others, had to duck quickly to avoid a\r\nbarrage of spears.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nKreiss was wounded. Chet found him dropped beside his firing platform\r\nworking methodically to extract the broad blade of a spear from his\r\nshoulder where it was embedded.\r\n\r\nChet's first thought was of poison, and he shouted for Towahg. But the\r\nsavage only looked once at the spear, seized it and with one quick jerk\r\ndrew the weapon from the wound; then, when the blood flowed freely, he\r\nmotioned to Chet that the man was all right.\r\n\r\nThe savage wadded a handful of leaves into a ball and pressed it against\r\nthe wound, and Chet improvised a first-aid bandage from Kreiss' ragged\r\nblouse before they put him from sight in one of the shelters and ran to\r\nrejoin Harkness and Diane on the rocks.\r\n\r\nBut the first wave was spent. There were no more snarling, white-toothed\r\nfaces above the barricade, and in the open space beyond were shambling\r\nforms that hid themselves in the long grass while others dragged\r\nthemselves to the same concealment or lay limply inert on the open,\r\nsunlit ground.\r\n\r\nAnd within the enclosure one solitary ape-man forgot his bruised body\r\nwhile he stamped up and down or whirled absurdly in a dance that\r\nexpressed his joy in victory.\r\n\r\n\"Better come down,\" said Chet. \"Schwartzmann might take a shot at you,\r\nalthough I think we are out of pistol range. We're lucky that isn't a\r\nservice gun he's got, but come down anyway, and we'll see what's next.\r\nThis time we've had the breaks, but there's more coming. Schwartzmann\r\nisn't through.\"\r\n\r\nBut Schwartzmann was through for the day; Chet was mistaken in expecting\r\na second assault so soon. He posted Towahg as sentry, and, with Diane\r\nand Harkness, threw himself before the door-flap of the shelter where\r\nKreiss had been hidden, and was now sitting up, his arm in a sling.\r\n\r\n\"Either you're a 'mighty hard man to kill,'\" he told Kreiss, \"or else\r\nTowahg is a powerful medicine man.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am still in the fight,\" the scientist assured him. \"I can't do any\r\nmore work with bow and arrow, but I can keep the rest of you supplied.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll need you,\" Chet assured him grimly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey ate in silence as the afternoon drew on toward evening.\r\n\r\nBack by their little fire, with Towahg on guard, Chet shot an\r\nappreciative glance at a white disk in the southern sky. \"Still getting\r\nthe breaks,\" he exulted. \"The moon is up; it will give us some light\r\nafter sunset, and later the Earth will rise and light things up around\r\nhere in good shape.\"\r\n\r\nThat white disk turned golden as the sun vanished where mountainous\r\nclouds loomed blackly far across the jungle-clad hills. Then the quick\r\nnight blanketed everything, and the golden moon made black the fringe of\r\nforest trees while it sent long lines of light through their waving,\r\nsinuous branches, to cast moving shadows that seemed strangely alive on\r\nthe open ground. Muffled by the jungle-sea that absorbed the sound\r\nwaves, faint grumblings came to them, and at a quiver of light in the\r\nblackness where the clouds had been, Harkness turned to Chet.\r\n\r\n\"We had all better get on the job,\" Chet was saying, as he took his bow\r\nand a supply of arrows, \"we've got our work cut out for us to-night.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Harkness nodded grimly as the flickering lightning played fitfully\r\nover far-distant trees. \"We crowed a bit too soon,\" he told Chet;\r\n\"there's a big storm coming, and that's a break for Schwartzmann. No\r\nlight from either moon or Earth to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe moon-disk, as he spoke, lost its first clear brilliance in the haze\r\nof the expanding clouds.\r\n\r\n\"Watch sharp, Towahg!\" Chet ordered. And, to the others: \"Get this fire\r\nmoved away from the huts--here. I'll do that, Walt. You bring a supply\r\nof wood; some of those dried leaves, too. We'll build a big fire, we\r\nhave to depend on that for light.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith the skeleton of a huge palm leaf he raked the fire out into an open\r\nspace; they had plenty of fuel and they fed the blaze until its mounting\r\nflames lighted the entire enclosure. But outside the barricade were dark\r\nshadows, and Chet saw that this light would only make targets of the\r\ndefenders, while the attackers could creep up in safety.\r\n\r\n\"'Way up,\" he ordered; \"we've got to have the fire on the top of the\r\nrocks.\" He clambered to the topmost level of the rocky outcrop and\r\ndragged a blazing stick with him. Harkness handed him more; and now the\r\nlight struck down and over the stockade and illumined the ground\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\"Here's your job, Kreiss,\" said Chet, \"if you're equal to it. You keep\r\nthat fire going and have a pile of dried husks handy if I call for a\r\nbright blaze.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to defend the whole works,\" he explained. \"That bunch today\r\ntried to jump us just from one side, but trust Schwartzmann to divide\r\nhis force and hit us from all sides next time.\r\n\r\n\"But we'll hold the fort,\" he said and he forced a confidence into his\r\nvoice that his inner thoughts did not warrant. To Harkness he whispered\r\nwhen Diane was away: \"Six shells in the gun, Walt; we won't waste them\r\non the apes. There's one for each of us including Towahg, and one extra\r\nin case you miss. We'll fight as long as we are able; then it's up to\r\nyou to shoot quick and straight.\"\r\n\r\nBut Walt Harkness felt for the pistol in his belt and handed it to Chet.\r\n\"I couldn't,\" he said, and his voice was harsh and strained, \"--not\r\nDiane; you'll have to, Chet.\" And Chet Bullard dropped his own useless\r\npistol to the ground while he slipped the other into its holster on the\r\nbelt that bound his ragged clothes about him, but he said nothing. He\r\nwas facing a situation where words were hardly adequate to express the\r\nsurging emotion within.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDiane had returned when he addressed Walt casually. \"Wonder why the\r\nbeggars didn't attack again,\" he pondered. \"Why has Schwartzmann waited;\r\nwhy hasn't he or one of his men crept up in the grass for a shot at us?\r\nHe's got some deviltry brewing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Waiting for night,\" hazarded Walt. He looked up to see Kreiss who had\r\njoined them.\r\n\r\n\"If Towahg could tend the fire,\" suggested the scientist, \"I could fire\r\nmy little catapult with one hand. I think I could do some damage.\" But\r\nChet shook his head and answered gently:\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid Towahg's the better man to-night, Kreiss. You can help best\r\nby giving us light. That's the province of science, you know,\" he added,\r\nand grinned up at the anxious man.\r\n\r\nEach moment of this companionship meant much to Chet. It was the last\r\nconference, he knew. They would be swamped, overwhelmed, and then--only\r\nthe pistol with its six shells was left. But he drew his thoughts back\r\nto the peaceful quiet of the present moment, though the hush was ominous\r\nwith the threat of the approaching storm and of the other assault that\r\nmust come in the storm's concealing darkness. He looked at Diane and\r\nWalt--comrades true and tender. The leaping flames from the rocks above\r\nmade flickering shadows on their upturned faces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe moment ended. A growl from where Towahg was on guard brought them\r\nscrambling to their feet. \"Gr-r-ranga!\" Towahg was warning. \"Granga\r\ncome!\"\r\n\r\nThey fired from their platforms as before, then raced for the rocks and\r\nthe elevation they afforded, for the black bodies had reached the\r\nstockade quickly in the half light. But they came again from one\r\npoint--the farthest curve of the U-shaped fence this time--and though a\r\nscore of black animal faces showed staring eyes and snarling fangs where\r\nheavy bodies were drawn up on the barricade, no one of them reached the\r\ninside.\r\n\r\n\"We're holding them!\" Chet was shouting. But the easy victory was too\r\ngood to believe; he knew there were more to come; this force of some\r\nthirty or forty was not all that Schwartzmann could throw into the\r\nfight. And Schwartzmann, himself! Chet had seen the bronzed faces of Max\r\nand another standing back of the assaulting force, but where was\r\nSchwartzmann?\r\n\r\nIt was Kreiss who answered the insistent question. From above on the\r\nrocks, where he had kept the fire blazing, Kreiss was calling in a\r\nhigh-pitched voice.\r\n\r\n\"The water!\" he shouted, \"they're attacking from the water!\" And Chet\r\nrushed around the broken rock-heap to see a lake like an inky pool,\r\nwhere the firelight showed faint reflections from black, shining faces;\r\nwhere rippling lines of phosphorescence marked each swimming savage; and\r\nwhere larger waves of ghostly light came from a log raft on which was a\r\nfamiliar figure whose face, through its black beard, showed white in\r\ncontrast with the faces of his companions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStill a hundred feet from the shore, they were approaching steadily,\r\ninexorably; and the storm, at that instant, broke with a ripping flash\r\nof light that tore the heavens apart, and that seared the picture of the\r\nattackers upon the eyeballs of the man who stared down.\r\n\r\nFrom behind him came sounds of a renewed attack. He heard Harkness:\r\n\"Shoot, Diane! Nail 'em, Towahg! There's a hundred of them!\" And the\r\nwind that came with the lightning flash, though it brought no rain,\r\nwhipped the black water of the lake to waves that drove the raft and the\r\nswimming savages closer--closer--\r\n\r\nChet glanced above him. \"Come down, Kreiss!\" he ordered. \"Get down here,\r\nquick! This is the finish. We could have licked them on land, but these\r\nothers will get us.\" He stood, dumb with amazement, as he saw the thin\r\nfigure of Kreiss leap excitedly from his rocky perch and vanish like a\r\nterrified rabbit into the cave in the rocks.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't think--\" he was telling himself in wondering disbelief at this\r\ncowardice, when Kreiss reappeared. His one hand was white with a rubbery\r\ncoating that Chet vaguely knew for latex. He was holding a gray, earthy\r\nmass, and he threw himself forward to the catapult where it stood idly\r\nerect in the wind that beat and whipped at it.\r\n\r\n\"Help me!\" It was Kreiss who ordered, and once more he spoke as if he\r\nwere conducting only an interesting experiment. \"Pull here! Bend\r\nit--bend it! Now hold steady; this is metallic sodium, a deposit I found\r\ndeep in the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe gray mass was in the crude bucket of the machine. Kreiss' knife was\r\nready. He slashed at the vine that he'd the bent sapling, and a gray\r\nmass whirled out into the dark; out and down--and the inky waters were\r\nin that instant ablaze with fire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The inky waters were ablaze with fire._]\r\n\r\nFire that threw itself in flaming balls; that broke into many parts and\r\neach part, like a living thing, darted crazily about; that leaped into\r\nthe air to fall again among ape-men who screamed frenziedly in animal\r\nterror.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"It unites with water,\" Kreiss was saying: \"a spontaneous liberation and\r\nignition of hydrogen.\" The white-coated hand had dumped another mass\r\ninto the primitive engine of war. \"Now pull--so--and I cut it!\" And the\r\nleaping, flashing fires tore furiously in redoubled madness where a\r\nshrieking mob of terrified beasts, and one white man among them, drove\r\nashore beyond the end of a barricade.\r\n\r\nChet felt Harkness beside him. \"We drove 'em off in back. What the devil\r\nis going on here?\" Walt was demanding. But Chet was watching the retreat\r\nof the blacks straight off and down the shore where the sand was smooth\r\nand neither grass nor trees could hinder their wild flight.\r\n\r\n\"You've got them licked,\" Harkness was exulting: \"and we've cleaned them\r\nup on our side. Just came over to see if you needed help.\"\r\n\r\n\"We sure would have,\" said Chet; \"more than you could give if it hadn't\r\nbeen for Kreiss.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got 'em licked!\" Harkness repeated wonderingly; \"we've won!\" It\r\nwas too much to grasp all at once. The victory had been so quick, and he\r\nhad already given up hope.\r\n\r\nThe two had clasped hands; they stood so for silent minutes. Chet had\r\nbeen nerved to the point of destroying his companions and himself; the\r\nrevulsion of feeling that victory brought was more stupefying than the\r\nthreat of impending defeat.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nStaring out over the black waters, he knew only vaguely when Harkness\r\nleft; a moment later he followed him gropingly around the jagged rocks,\r\nwhile there came to him, blurred by his own mental numbness, a shouted\r\ncall.... But a moment elapsed before he was aroused, before he knew it\r\nfor Walt's voice. He recognized the agonized tone and sprang forward\r\ninto the clearing.\r\n\r\nThe fire still blazed on the rocky platform above; its uncertain light\r\nreached the figure of a running man who was making madly for the opening\r\nin the wall. As he ran he screamed over and over, in a voice hoarse and\r\nhorrible like one seized in the fright of a fearful dream: \"Diane!\r\nDiane, wait! For God's sake, Diane, don't go!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the driven clouds were torn apart for a space to let through a clear\r\ngolden light. The great lantern of Earth was flashing down through space\r\nto light a grassy opening in a jungle of another world, where, stark and\r\nrigid, a girl was walking toward the shadow-world beyond, while before\r\nher went a black shape, huge and powerful, in whose head were eyes like\r\nburning lights, and whose arms were rigidly extended as if to draw the\r\nstricken girl on and on.\r\n\r\nThe running figure overtook them. Chet saw him checked in mid-spring,\r\nand Harkness, too, stood rigid as if carved from stone, then followed as\r\ndid Diane, where the ape-thing led.... From the far side of the\r\nclearing, where Schwartzmann's men had gone, came a great shout of\r\nlaughter that jarred Chet from the stupor that bound him.\r\n\r\n\"The messenger!\" he said aloud. \"God help them; it's the messenger--and\r\nhe's taking them to the pyramid!\"\r\n\r\nThen the torn clouds closed that the greater darkness might cover those\r\nwho vanished in the shadowed fringe of a stormy, wind-whipped jungle....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n_On to the Pyramid_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was like Walt Harkness to rush impetuously after where Diane was\r\nbeing drawn away; but who, under the same circumstances, would have done\r\notherwise? Yet it was like Chet, too, to keep a sane and level head, to\r\ncheck the first wild impulse to dash to their rescue, to realize that he\r\nwould be throwing himself away by doing it and helping them not at all.\r\nIt was like Chet to stop and think when thinking was desperately needed,\r\nthough what it would lead to he could not have told. There were many\r\nfactors that entered into his calculations.\r\n\r\nHalf-consciously he had walked to the barricade that he might stare into\r\nthe blackness beyond. The worst of the storm had passed, and the strong\r\nEarth-light forced its way through the thinning clouds in a cold, gray\r\nglow. It served to show the great gateway to the jungle, empty and\r\nblack, until Chet saw more of the man-beasts he had called messengers.\r\n\r\nA file of them, stolid, woodenly walking--he could not fail to know them\r\nfrom the ape-men of the tribe. And they moved through the darkness\r\ntoward the sounds of shouts and laughter.\r\n\r\nChet saw them when they returned; following them were three others.\r\nSchwartzmann was not one of them; but the pilot, Max, Chet could\r\ndistinguish plainly; the other two, he was sure, were the men of\r\nSchwartzmann's crew.\r\n\r\nAnd, for each of them, all laughter and shouted jests had escaped. They\r\nmoved like wooden toys half-come to life. And they, too, vanished where\r\nWalt and Diane had gone through the high arch of the jungle's open door.\r\n\r\nChet knew Kreiss was beside him; at a short distance, Towahg, staring\r\nabove the palisade, buried his unkempt, hairy head in the shelter of his\r\narms. All of Towahg's savage bravery had oozed away at direct sight of\r\nthe pyramid men; Chet, even through his heavy-hearted dismay, was aware\r\nof the courage that must have carried this primitive man to their rescue\r\non that other black night when the pyramid had been about to swallow,\r\nthem up.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the pyramid all Chet's thoughts had been tending. There Diane and\r\nHarkness were bound; there he, too, must go, though the thought of\r\ndriving himself into that black maw, through the overpowering stench and\r\ndown to the pit where some horror of mystery lay waiting, was almost\r\nmore than his conscious mind could accept. But, with the sight of Towahg\r\nand the abject fear that had overwhelmed him, Chet found his own mind\r\ncalmly determined, though through that cool self-detachment came savage\r\nspoken words.\r\n\r\n\"If poor Towahg could go near that damned place,\" he reasoned, \"am I\r\ngoing to be stopped by anything between heaven and hell?\"\r\n\r\nAnd his mind was suddenly at ease with the certainty of the next step he\r\nmust take. He turned to speak to Kreiss, but paused instead to stare\r\ninto the dark where shadows that were not the ghosts of clouds were\r\nmoving. Then his whispered orders came sharply to the scientist and to\r\nTowahg.\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" he commanded. \"Come quickly; follow me!\"\r\n\r\nThe two were behind him as he found the narrow opening in the barrier's\r\nfarther side, passed through, and crouched low in the darkness as he ran\r\ntoward the lake where the shallow water of the shore took no mark of\r\ntheir hurrying feet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the end of the lake he stopped. Beside him, Kreiss, weakened by his\r\nwound, was panting and gasping; Towahg, moving like a dark shadow, was\r\nclose behind.\r\n\r\n\"I saw them,\" said Kreiss, when he had breath enough for speech, \"--more\r\nbeasts from the pyramid. They were coming for us! But we can go back\r\nthere after a day or so.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can,\" Chet told him; \"Towahg and I are going on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" Kreiss demanded.\r\n\r\n\"To the pyramid.\"\r\n\r\nChet's reply was brief, and Kreiss' response was equally so. \"You're a\r\nfool,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Chet told him: \"I know there's nothing I can do to help them.\r\nBut I'm going. All I ask is to get one crack at whatever it is that is\r\ndown in that beastly pit and if I can't do that maybe I can still save\r\nDiane and Walt from tortures you and I can't imagine.\" He touched his\r\npistol suggestively.\r\n\r\n\"Still I say you are a fool,\" Kreiss insisted. \"They are gone--captured;\r\nthey will die. That is regrettable, but it is done. Now, besides Herr\r\nSchwartzmann who escaped, only we two remain; the savage, he does not\r\ncount. We two!--and a new world!--and science! Science that remains\r\nafter these two are gone--after you and I are gone! It is greater than\r\nus all.\r\n\r\n\"But I, staying, shall contribute to the knowledge of men; I shall make\r\ndiscoveries that will bear my name always. This world is my laboratory;\r\nI have found deposits such as none has ever seen on Earth.\r\n\r\n\"Be reasonable, Herr Bullard. The enemy has tracked us down by his\r\nsuperior cleverness. We will go far away now where he never shall find\r\nus, you and I. Do not be a fool; do not throw your life away.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet Bullard, a figure of helpless, hopeless despair, stood unspeaking\r\nwhile he stared into the black depths of the jungle, and the night wind\r\nwhipped his tattered clothing about him.\r\n\r\n\"A fool!\" he said at last, and his voice was dull and heavy. \"I guess\r\nyou're right--\"\r\n\r\nHerr Kreiss interrupted: \"Of course I am right--right and reasonable and\r\nlogical!\"\r\n\r\nChet went on as if the other had not spoken:\r\n\r\n\"If I hadn't been a fool I would have found some way to prevent it; I\r\nwould have killed that ape-thing when first I saw it; I would have got\r\nthem free.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned slowly to face his companion in the darkness.\r\n\r\n\"But you were wrong, Kreiss; you forgot a couple of things. You said\r\nthey found us by their superior cleverness. That's wrong. They found us\r\nbecause you left a trail they could follow. We threw them off once,\r\nTowahg and I, but the messenger wouldn't be fooled. Then Schwartzmann\r\nand his pack followed the messenger in.\r\n\r\n\"And you say it is logical that I should quit here, leave Diane and Walt\r\nto take whatever is coming; you say I'm a fool to stay with them till\r\nthe end.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\"--he was speaking very quietly, very simply--\"if you are right\r\nI'm rather glad that I'm a fool. For you see, Kreiss, they're my\r\nfriends, and between friends logic gets knocked all to hell.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Towahg!\" he called. \"Let's see if we can travel this jungle in\r\nthe night!\" He set off toward the fringe of great trees, then let Towahg\r\ngo ahead to find a trail.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTravel at night through the tangle of creepers was not humanly possible.\r\nEven Towahg, after an hour's work, grunted his disgust and curled\r\nhimself up for the night. And Chet, though he found his mind filled with\r\nvain imaginings, was so drained by the day's demands on his nervous\r\nenergy that he slept through to the rising of the sun.\r\n\r\nThen they circled wide of the trail they had taken before; no risk would\r\nChet take of a chance meeting with one of the pyramid apes. And he\r\nplagued his brain with vain questions of what he should do when he\r\nreached the arena and the pyramid and the unknown something that waited\r\nwithin, until he told himself in desperation: \"You're going down, you're\r\ngoing into that damned place; that's all you know for sure.\"\r\n\r\nWhereupon his questioning ceased, and his mind was clear enough to think\r\nof giant creepers that barred his way, of streams to be crossed, and to\r\nwonder, at the last, when the valley of the pyramid was in sight and\r\nwhether the others had reached there before him.\r\n\r\nAnother day's sun was beating straight down into the arena when again it\r\nopened before Chet's eyes. And the bleak horror of this place of black\r\nand white that had seemed so incredibly unreal under Earth-lit skies was\r\ndoubly so in the glare of noon.\r\n\r\nThey entered through the jagged crack that had been their means of\r\nescape. An earthquake, one time, had split the stone, and Chet was more\r\nthan satisfied to avoid the broad entrance where the rocks made a\r\ngateway and where hostile eyes might be watching.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe stood for long minutes in the cleft in the rocks where the hard earth\r\nof the arena made a floor before him, where the huge steps of ribboned\r\nwhite and black swung out on either hand, and where, directly ahead, in\r\nthe same hard, contrasting strata, a pyramid lifted itself to finish in\r\na projecting capstone. And now that he faced it he found himself\r\ncuriously cool.\r\n\r\nHe motioned Towahg to his side, and the black came cowering and\r\ntrembling. He had tried before to ask Towahg about the mystery of the\r\npyramid, but Towahg had never understood, or, as Chet believed, he had\r\npretended not to understand. But now he could no longer feign ignorance\r\nof Chet's queries.\r\n\r\nChet pointed to the pyramid with a commanding hand. \"What is there?\" he\r\ndemanded. \"Towahg afraid! What is Towahg afraid of? Ape-men go in\r\nthere--Gr-r-ranga-men; who sends for them?\"\r\n\r\nAnd Towahg, who must know the sense of the questions, even though some\r\nwords were strange, could not answer. He dropped to his knees there in\r\nthe narrow, ragged chasm in the rock and clutched at Chet's legs with\r\nhis two hands while he buried his shaggy head in his arms. Then--\r\n\r\n\"Krargh!\" he wailed; \"Krargh there! Krargh send--Gr-r-ranga go.\r\nGr-r-ranga no come back!\"\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps the longest speech Towahg had ever made, and Chet nodded\r\nhis understanding. \"Yes,\" he agreed; \"that's right. I imagine. When\r\nKrargh sends for you, you never come back.\"\r\n\r\nBut more eloquent than the ape-man's halting words was the trembling of\r\nhis muscle-knotted shoulders in a fear that struck him limp at Chet's\r\nfeet. And the pilot realized that the fear was inspired in part by the\r\nthought in the savage mind that his master might ask him to go closer to\r\nthe place of dread. He had followed them once and had struck down a\r\nmessenger, but this was when he was avid with curiosity and\r\nhalf-worshipful of the white men as gods. Now, to go that dreadful way\r\nin full daylight!--it was more than Towahg could face.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet patted the cringing shoulder with a kindly hand. \"Get up, Towahg,\"\r\nhe ordered and pointed back toward the jungle. \"Towahg wait outside;\r\nwait today and to-night!\" He gave the ape-man's sign of the open and\r\nclosed hand to signify one day and one night, and Towahg's grunt was\r\nhalf in relief and half in understanding as he slipped back into hiding\r\nwhere the jungle pressed close.\r\n\r\nChet turned again to the pyramid. \"They're down there,\" he told himself,\r\n\"facing God knows what. And now it's sink or swim, and I'm almighty\r\nafraid I know which it's to be. But we'll take it together: 'When Krargh\r\nsends for you, you never come back.'\"\r\n\r\nNo jungle sounds were here in this silent arena, no flashing of\r\nleather-winged birds nor scuttling of little, odd creatures of the\r\nground. It was as if some terror had spread its dark wings above the\r\nplace, a terror unseen of men. But the little, wild things of earth and\r\nair had seen, and they had fled long since from a place unclean and\r\nunfit for life.\r\n\r\nChet felt the silence pressing heavily upon him as he took his hand from\r\nthe rock at his side and stepped out into the arena. And the vast\r\namphitheater seemed peopled with phantom shapes that sat in serried rows\r\nand watched him with dead and terrible eyes, while he went the long way\r\nto the pyramid's base, and his feet found the rough stone ascent....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n_The Monstrous Something_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way to the top of the pyramid was long. One look Chet allowed\r\nhimself out over this world--one slow, sweeping gaze that took in the\r\nbare floor at the pyramid's base, a level platform of rock some distance\r\nin front of the pyramid, the hard black and white of the walled oval,\r\nthe sea of waving green that was the jungle beyond, and, beyond that,\r\nhills, misty and shimmering in the noonday heat. And nestled there,\r\nbeyond that last bare ridge, must be the valley of happiness, Diane\r\nDelacouer's \"Happy Valley.\"\r\n\r\nChet Bullard turned abruptly where the projecting capstone hung heavy\r\nabove a shadowed entrance. He entered the blackness within, stopped once\r\nin choking nausea as the first wave of vile air struck him, then fought\r\nhis way on till his searching feet found the stairway, and he knew he\r\nwas descending into a pit that held something inhumanly horrible--an\r\nabomination unto all gods of decency and right.\r\n\r\nAnd still there persisted that abnormal coolness that made him almost\r\nlight-headed, almost carefree. Even the fetid stench ceased to offend.\r\nHis feet moved with never a sound to find the first step--and the\r\nnext--and the next. He must go cautiously; he must not betray his\r\npresence until he was ready to strike.\r\n\r\nJust where that blow would be delivered or against what adversary he\r\ncould not tell, and perhaps it would be given him only to save Diane and\r\nWalt by the grace of a merciful bullet. It made no difference. Nothing\r\nmade any difference any more; they had had their day, and now if the\r\nnight came suddenly that was all he could ask. And still his cautious\r\nfeet were carrying him down and yet down....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was far below the surface of the ground when he found the foot of the\r\nstairs. They had been a spiral; his hand had touched one wall that led\r\nhim smoothly around a shaft like a great well. And now there was firm\r\nrock beneath his feet, where, with one hand still guiding him along the\r\nstone wall, he followed the wall into a darkness that was an almost\r\nsolid, opaque black. He seemed lost in a great void, smothered in\r\nsilence, and buried under the black weight of the pressing dark, until\r\nthe sound of a footfall gave him sense of direction and of distance.\r\n\r\nIt made soft echoings along rock walls that picked up every slightest\r\nrustle, and Chet realized again how cautious his own advance must be.\r\nIt came toward him, soft, scuffing, followed the wall where he\r\nstood ... and Chet felt that approaching presence almost upon him before\r\nhe stepped silently out and away.\r\n\r\nAnd in the darkness that blotted out his sight he sensed with some inner\r\neye the passing ape-man with arms rigidly extended, while a wave of\r\nthankfulness flooded him as he realized that in the dark the brute was\r\nas blind as himself and that the terrible thing that had sent him could\r\nsee at a distance only with the ape-man's eyes.\r\n\r\nHere was something definite to count on. As long as he remained silent,\r\nas long as he kept himself hidden, he was safe.\r\n\r\nThe scuffling footsteps had gone to nothing in the distance when Chet\r\nreached out for the wall and went swiftly, carefully, on. The messenger\r\nhad come this way; he could hurry now that he knew there was safe\r\nfooting in the dark.\r\n\r\nThe wall ended in a sharp corner; it formed a right angle, and the new\r\nsurface went on and away from him. Chet was debating whether he should\r\nfollow or should cast out into the darkness when his staring eyes found\r\nthe first touch of light.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt came from above, a wavering line that trembled to a flame which\r\nseemed curiously cold. The line grew: a foot-wide band of light high up\r\non the wall, it thrust itself forward like a tendril of the horrible\r\nplants he had seen. It grew on and wrapped itself about a great room,\r\nwhile, behind it, cold flames flickered and leaped. And Chet, so\r\ninterested was he in the motion of this light that seemed almost alive,\r\nrealized only after some moments that the light was betraying him.\r\n\r\nHe glanced quickly about and found himself within a chamber of huge\r\nproportions. Walls that only nature could form reared themselves high in\r\nthe putrescent air of the room; they curved into a ceiling, and from\r\nthat ceiling there hung a glittering array of gems.\r\n\r\nChet knew them for great stalactites, and, even as he cast about\r\ndesperately for some secluded nook, he marveled at the diamond\r\nbrilliance of the display. But on the smooth floor of stone, where\r\ncorresponding stalagmites must have been, were no traces of crystal\r\ngrowths, from which he knew that though nature had formed the room some\r\nother power had fitted it to its own use.\r\n\r\nChet's eyes were darting swift glances about. There was no single moving\r\nthing, no sign of life; he was still undiscovered. But it could not last\r\nlong, this safety; he looked vainly for some niche where the light would\r\nnot strike so clearly, so betrayingly.\r\n\r\nAcross the great chamber was a platform fifteen feet above the floor.\r\nEven at a distance Chet knew this was not a natural formation; he could\r\nsee where the stones had been cleverly fitted. And now his eyes,\r\naccustomed to the light, saw that the platform was carpeted with hides\r\nand strange furs. There were some that hung over the edge; they reached\r\nalmost to the upright block like a table or altar at the platform's\r\nbase. On this altar another great hide of thick leather was spread; it\r\ndragged in places on the floor.\r\n\r\nBare floors, bare walls--no place where an intruder could remain\r\nconcealed! Suddenly from the lighted mouth of another passage he heard\r\nsounds of many feet; the sounds of approaching feet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe impulse that threw him across the room was born of desperation; he\r\nraced frantically to cross the wide expanse before those feet brought\r\ntheir owners within view, and he fought to keep his panting breath\r\ninaudible while he tugged at the heavy leather altar covering, stiff and\r\nthick as a board; while he forced his crouching body beneath and found\r\nspace there where he could move freely about.\r\n\r\nIt walled him in completely on the platform side where it hung to the\r\nfloor, but on the other three sides there were gaps near the floor where\r\nthe light shone in on two pedestals of stone that supported the stone\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nBetween the pedestals Chet crouched, hardly daring to look, hardly\r\ndaring to breathe, while feet, bare and black, tramped shufflingly past.\r\nThey went in groups--he lost count of their number but knew there were\r\nhundreds; he heard them going to the platform above. And, through the\r\nsound of the naked feet, came disjointed fragments of thought that\r\nreached his brain, transformed to words.\r\n\r\nMere fragments at first: \"... back; the Master goes first!... The\r\nlights--how grateful is their coolness!... Who stumbled? Careless and\r\nstupid ape! You, Bearer-captain, shall take him to the torture room; a\r\ntouch of fire will help his infirmity!\"\r\n\r\nAnd there was a cold rage that accompanied the last which set Chet's\r\ntense nerves a-tingle. But there was no fear in the emotion; he was\r\nquivering with a fierce, instinctive, animal hate.\r\n\r\nThe black feet retraced their steps. Then there was silence, and Chet\r\nknew there was something above him on the platform; whether one or many\r\nhe could not tell until an interchange of thoughts reached him to show\r\nthere was at least more than one.\r\n\r\n\"A presence!\" some unseen thing was thinking. \"I sense a strange mental\r\nforce!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA moment of panic gripped Chet at the threat of discovery. Then he\r\nforced himself to relax; he tried to make his mind a blank; or if not\r\nthat, to think of anything but himself--of the jungle, the ape-men, of\r\nthe two comrades who had been captured.\r\n\r\n\"Patience!\" another thinker was counseling. \"It is the captives; they\r\ndraw near.\" And across the great room, from the same passage where he\r\nhad entered, Chet heard again the sound of bare, scuffing feet.\r\n\r\nHe could see them at last; he dared, to stop and peer along the floor.\r\nBare feet--black, hairy legs, and then came sounds of clumping leather\r\nthat brought Chet's heart into his throat, until, directly before the\r\naltar that made his shelter, he saw the stained shoes and torn leggings\r\nof Walt Harkness, and beside them, the little boots and jungle-stained\r\nstockings that encased the slender legs of Mademoiselle Diane.\r\n\r\nThey were there before him, Walt and Diane; he would see them if he but\r\ndared to look. And, from somewhere above, a confusion of thought\r\nmessages poured in upon him like the unintelligible medley of many\r\nvoices. Out of them came one, clearer, more commanding:\r\n\r\n\"Silence! Be still, all! Your Master speaks. I shall question the\r\ncaptives.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there came to Chet, crouched beneath the altar, hardly breathing,\r\nlistening, tense, a battering of questioning thoughts. He heard no\r\nanswer from Harkness and Diane, but he knew that their minds were open\r\npages to the one from whom those thought-waves issued.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you from?--what part of this globe?... Another world?\r\nImpossible! This is our own world, Rajj. It is alone. There is no nearby\r\nstar.\"\r\n\r\nAnd after a moment, when Harkness had silently answered, came other\r\nthoughts:\r\n\r\n\"Strange! Strange! This creature of an inferior race says that our world\r\nhas joined hands with his; that his is greater; that our own world,\r\nRajj, is now a satellite of his world that he calls by the strange name\r\nof 'Earth.'\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo Chet it seemed that this one mysterious thinker, this \"Master\" of an\r\nunknown realm, was explaining his findings to other mysterious beings.\r\nThere followed a babel of released thoughts from which Chet got only a\r\nconfused impression of conflicting emotions: curiosity, rage, hate, and\r\na cold ferocity that bound them into one powerful, vindictive whole.\r\n\r\nAgain the leader quieted the rest; again he laid open the minds of Walt\r\nand Diane for his exploring questions, while Chet mentally listened and\r\ntried to picture what manner of thing this was that held two Earth-folk\r\nhelpless, that called them \"creatures of an inferior race.\"\r\n\r\nSuper-men? No? Super-beasts, these must be. Chet was chilled with a\r\nnameless horror as he sensed the cold deadliness and implacable hate in\r\nthe traces of emotion that clung and came to him with the thoughts. And\r\nhis imagination balked at trying to picture thinking creatures so\r\nabominably vile as these thinkers must be.\r\n\r\nThe questions went on and on. Chet lost all sense of time. He had the\r\nfeeling that the two helpless prisoners were being mentally flayed. No\r\nthought, no hidden emotion, but was stripped from them and displayed\r\nbefore the mental gaze of these inhuman inquisitors. No physical torture\r\ncould have been more revolting.\r\n\r\nAnd at list the ordeal was ended. Chet had forgotten Schwartzmann's men\r\nuntil the \"Master's\" order recalled them to his mind. \"Bring the other\r\ncaptives!\" the unspoken thought commanded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet crouched low to see from under the hanging leather. Naked feet\r\nshuffled aimlessly; they were raised and put down again in the same\r\nposition, until the dazed and hypnotized blacks received their orders\r\nand drew Diane and Harkness to one side. Then other leather-shod feet\r\ncame into view as Max and his companions were brought forward.\r\n\r\nBut there was no more questioning. \"Perhaps another day we shall amuse\r\nourselves with them,\" a thinker said. Chet, for the first time was\r\npaying no attention.\r\n\r\nA slit in the leather--it might bare been where a spear had entered to\r\nslay a dinosaur in some earlier age--served now as a peep-hole from\r\nwhich Chet saw two gray and lifeless faces that were expressionless as\r\nstone. And, as if their bodies, too, were carved from granite, Diane and\r\nHarkness stood motionless.\r\n\r\nHe saw the blacks, saw that all eyes were on the other prisoners. Only\r\nHarkness and Diane stood with lowered gaze, staring stonily at the floor\r\nwhere the leather hung. And through Chet's mind flashed a quick impulse\r\nthat set his nerves thrilling and quivering, though he checked the\r\nemotion in an instant lest some other mind should sense it.\r\n\r\nThose other minds were not contacting Walt and Diane now. Could he reach\r\nthem? Chet wondered. That they were conscious, that they knew with\r\nhorrible clearness every detail of what went on, Chet was certain: his\r\nown brief experience that first night on the pyramid had taught him\r\nthat. And now if these two could see and comprehend what they saw: if\r\nonly he could send them a word--one flashing message of hope! His hands\r\nwere working swiftly at his belt.\r\n\r\nThe detonite pistol slipped silently from its sheath. And as silently he\r\nplaced it on the floor where the two were looking, then slid it\r\ncautiously underneath the leather that just cleared the floor.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis eye was close to the narrow slit. Did a change of expression flash\r\nfor an instant across the face of Walt Harkness? Was it only\r\nimagination, or was there the briefest flicker of life in the dead eyes\r\nof Diane Delacouer? Chet could not be sure, but he dared to hope.\r\n\r\nThe \"Master\" was speaking. To Chet came a conviction that he must not\r\nfail to hear these thoughts. He restored the pistol to his belt.\r\n\r\n\"And now the time has come,\" flashed the message. \"One thousand times\r\nhas Rajj circled the sun since we put his light behind us and came down\r\nto the dark place that had been prepared.\r\n\r\n\"One hundred others and myself; we were the peerless leaders of a\r\npeerless race. To produce the marvelous mentality that made us what we\r\nwere, all the forces of evolution had been laboring for ages. We were\r\nsupreme, and for us there was nothing left; no further growth.\r\n\r\n\"Then, what said Vashta, the All-Wise One? That I and a hundred chosen\r\nones should descend into the dark, there to live until a new world was\r\nready for us, lest our great race of Krargh perish.\" Chet started at the\r\nname. Krargh! It was the same word that Towahg had used.\r\n\r\nThe mental message went on:\r\n\r\n\"And we alone survive. Our world of Rajj is a wasteland where once we\r\nand our fellows lived. And we have been patient, awaiting the day. The\r\nbiped beasts, as you know, have been our food; we have trained them to\r\nbe our slaves as well. By the power of our invincible minds we have sent\r\nthem out to do our bidding and bring in more of the man-herd for\r\nslaughter when we hungered.\r\n\r\n\"And now, remember the words of Vashta, the All-Wise: 'until a new world\r\nis ready.' O Peerless Ones, the new world waits. These ignorant, white\r\nanimals have brought the word. We had thought that Vashta meant us to\r\nmake a new world of our old world of Rajj, but what of this new world\r\ncalled Earth? Perhaps that will be ours.\"\r\n\r\nChet felt the thinker break in on his own thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"One thousand years, but not to a day. Tell us, O Keeper of the Records,\r\nwhen is the time?\"\r\n\r\nAnd another's thoughts came in answer: \"Six days, Master; six days\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nThe leader's thoughts crashed in with an almost physical violence:\r\n\r\n\"On the sixth night we shall go out! In darkness we have lived; in\r\ndarkness we shall emerge. Then shall we feast in the arena of Vashta as\r\nwe did of old. We shall see this new world; we shall breed and people\r\nthe world; we shall take up our lives again.\r\n\r\n\"Let the captives live!\" he commanded. \"Feed them well. They shall be\r\nthe sacrifice to Vashta--all but the woman. She shall see the blood of\r\nthe others flow on the altar stone; then shall she come to me.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a chorus of mental protests; of counter claims. The leader\r\nquieted them as before.\r\n\r\n\"I am Master of All,\" he told them. \"Would you dispute with me over this\r\nbeast of the Earth--a creature of no mental growth? Absurd! But she\r\ninterests me somewhat; I will find her amusing for a time.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were bearers who came crowding in; and again in groups they left.\r\nThey were on the side where Chet dared not look, but he knew each group\r\nof blacks meant a mysterious something that was being carried carefully.\r\n\r\nAnd somewhere in the confusion of black, shuffling feet the others\r\nvanished. No sight of Walt or Diane did the slitted leather give; only a\r\nmotley crew of blacks who were left, and a wall, high-sprung to a\r\nglittering ceiling, and flaming, cold fire that ebbed and flowed till\r\nthe room's last occupant was gone. Then the flames faded to dense\r\nblackness where only fitful images on the retina of Chet's staring eyes\r\nflared and waned, and ghostly voices seemed still whispering through the\r\nclamoring silence of the room....\r\n\r\nThey were echoing within his brain and harshly at his taut nerves as he\r\nmade his slow way toward the passage through which he had come. Despite\r\ntheir terror-filled urging he did not run, but took one silent, cautious\r\nstep at a time, until, after centuries of waiting, his eyes found a\r\nsquare of light that was blinding; and he knew that he was stumbling\r\nthrough the portal in the top of the pyramid of Vashta--Vashta the\r\nAll-Wise--unholy preceptor of an inhuman race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n_Sacrifice_\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Down in the pyramid! You went down there?\" Herr Kreiss forgot even his\r\nabsorbing experiments to exclaim incredulously at Chet's report.\r\n\r\nGuided by Towahg, Chet had returned to Happy Valley. There had been six\r\ndays and nights to be spent, and he felt that he should tell Kreiss what\r\nhe had learned.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Chet dully; \"yes, I went down.\"\r\n\r\nHe was seated on a rock in the enclosure they had built. He raised his\r\ndeep-sunk, sleepless eyes to stare at the house where he and Walt had\r\nworked. There Walt and Diane were to have made their home; Chet found\r\nsomething infinitely pathetic now in the unfinished shelter: its very\r\ncrudities seemed to cry aloud against the blight that had fallen upon\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\n\"And what was there?\" Kreiss demanded. \"This hypnotic power--was it an\r\nattribute of the ape-men themselves? That seems highly improbable. Or\r\nwas there something else--some other source of the thought waves or\r\nradiations of mental force?\"\r\n\r\nChet was still answering almost in monosyllables. \"Something else,\" he\r\ntold Kreiss.\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" exclaimed the scientist, \"I should have liked to see them. Such\r\nmental attainment! Such control of the great thought-force which with us\r\nis so little developed! Mind--pure mentality--carried to that stage of\r\nconscious development, would be worthy of our highest admiration. I\r\nshould like to meet such men.\"\r\n\r\n\"They're not men,\" said Chet; \"they're--they're--\"\r\n\r\nHe knew how unable he was to put into words his impression of the unseen\r\nthings, and he suddenly became voluble with hate.\r\n\r\n\"God knows what they are!\" he exclaimed, \"but they're not men. 'Mind',\r\nyou say; 'mentality!' Well, if those coldly devilish things are an\r\nexample of what mind can evolve into when there's no decency of soul\r\nalong with it, then I tell you hell's full of some marvelous minds!\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang abruptly to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to get out of here,\" he said; \"I can't stand it. Four more\r\ndays, and that's the end of it all. I'm going back to the ship. I saw it\r\nfrom up on the divide. Still buried in gas--but I'm going back. If I\r\ncould just get in there I might do something. There's all our\r\nsupplies--our storage of detonite; I might do some good work yet!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe was pacing up and down restlessly where a path had been worn on the\r\ngrassy knoll, worn by his feet and the pitiful, bruised feet he had seen\r\nfrom his shelter in the pyramid; worn by Walt and Diane--his comrades!\r\nAnd they were helpless; their whole hope lay in him! The thought of his\r\nown impotence was maddening. He poured out the story of his experience\r\nin the pyramid, as if the telling might give him relief.\r\n\r\nKreiss sat in silence, listening to it all. He broke in at last.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" he ordered. \"There are some questions I would have answered. You\r\nsaid once that they found us--these devils that you tell of--because of\r\nthe trail that I left. That is true?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Chet agreed irritably, \"but what of it? It's all over now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly not,\" Herr Kreiss demurred; \"quite possibly not. The fault, it\r\nappears, was mine. Who shall say where the results of that fault shall\r\nlead?\r\n\r\n\"And you say that these thinking creatures are devils, and that they\r\nplan to sacrifice your good friends to strange gods; and still the fault\r\nleads on.\" Herr Kreiss, to whom cause and effect were sure guides,\r\nseemed meditating upon the strange workings of immutable laws.\r\n\r\n\"And you say that if you could reach the interior of your ship you might\r\nperhaps be of help. Yes, it is so! And the ship is engulfed in a fluid\r\nsea, but the sea is of gas. Now in that I am not to blame, and\r\nyet--and--yet--they all tie in together at the last; yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about?\" demanded Chet Bullard harshly. \"It's no\r\nuse to moralize on who is to blame. If you know anything to do, speak\r\nup; if not--\"\r\n\r\nHerr Kreiss raised his spare frame erect. \"I shall do better than that,\"\r\nhe stated; \"I shall act.\" And Chet stared curiously after, as the thin\r\nfigure clambered up on the rocks and vanished into the cave.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe forgot him then and turned to stare moodily across the enclosure that\r\nhad been the scene of their battle. Kreiss had done good work there; he\r\nhad scared the savages into a panic fear. Chet was seeing again the\r\nscenes of that night when a faint explosion came from the rocks at his\r\nside. He looked up to see Herr Kreiss stagger from the cave.\r\n\r\nEyebrows and lashes were gone; his hair was tinged short; but his thick\r\nglasses had protected his eyes. He breathed deeply of the outside air as\r\nhe regarded the remnant of a bladder that once had held a sample of\r\ngreen gas. Then, without a word of explanation, he turned again into the\r\ncave where a thin trickle of smoke was issuing.\r\n\r\nRagged and torn, his clothes were held together by bits of vine. There\r\nwere longer ropes of the same material that made a sling on his\r\nshoulders when he reappeared. And, tied in the sling, were bundles; one\r\nlarge, one small, but sagging with weight. Both were bound tightly in\r\nwrappings of broad leaves.\r\n\r\n\"We will go now,\" Herr Kreiss stated: \"there is no time to be lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go? Go where?\" Chet's question echoed his utter bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"To the ship! Come, savage!\"--he motioned to Towahg--\"I did not do well\r\nwhen I made my way alone. You shall lead now.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's crazy,\" Chet told himself half aloud: \"his motor's shot and his\r\ncontrols are jammed! Oh, well; what's the difference? I might as well\r\nspend the time this way as any. I meant to go back to the old ship once\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nKreiss' arm still troubled from the wound he had got in the fight, but\r\nChet could not induce him to share his load.\r\n\r\n\"_Es ist mein recht_,\" he grumbled, and added cryptically: \"To each man\r\nthis only is sure--that he must carry his own cross.\" And Chet, with a\r\nshrug, let him have his way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was little said on the trip. Chet was as silent and\r\nuncommunicative as Kreiss when, for the last time, he paused on the\r\ndivide to see the green glint from a distant ship, then plunged with the\r\nothers into a forest as unreal as all this experience now seemed.\r\n\r\nAnd at the last, when the red light of late afternoon ensanguined a wild\r\nworld, they came to the smoke of Fire Valley, and a thousand fumeroles,\r\nlittle and big, that emitted their flame and gas. And one, at the lower\r\nend of the valley had built up a great mound of greasy mud from whose\r\ntop issued hot billows of green gas. It was here that Kreiss paused and\r\nunslung his pack.\r\n\r\n\"Take this,\" he told Chet; and the pilot dragged his reluctant eyes from\r\nthe view of the nearby cylinder enveloped in green clouds. The scientist\r\nwas handing him the larger of the two packages. It was bulky but light:\r\nChet took it by a loop in one of the vines.\r\n\r\n\"Careful!\" warned Kreiss. \"I have worked on it for a month; you see, my\r\nequipment was not so good. I thought that the time might come when it\r\nwould be put to use, only first I must conquer the gas--which I now\r\nprepare to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand,\" Chet protested.\r\n\r\n\"You are a Master Pilot of the World?\" questioned Kreiss, and Chet\r\nnodded.\r\n\r\n\"And the control on your ship was a modification of the new ball-control\r\nmechanism such as is used on the latest of the high-level liners?\"\r\n\r\nAgain Chet nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Then, if ever you are so fortunate, Herr Bullard, as to see once more\r\nthat device on one of those ships, will you examine it carefully? And,\r\nstamped on the under side, you will find--\"\r\n\r\n\"The patent marking,\" said Chet; then stopped short as the light of\r\nunderstanding blazed into his brain.\r\n\r\n\"Patented,\" he reflected; \"that's what it says,\" and a wondering\r\ncomprehension was in his voice: \"patented by H. Kreiss, of Austria!\r\nYou--you are the inventor?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I did not speak with entire truth to Herr Schwartzmann,\" admitted\r\nKreiss, \"on that occasion when I told him I could not rebuild the\r\ncontrol you had demolished. With your equipment on the ship I could have\r\ndone a quite creditable job, but even now,\"--he pointed to the\r\nleaf-wrapped bundle in Chet's hand--\"with copper I have hammered from\r\nthe rocks, and with silver and gold and even iron which I found\r\noccurring in a quite novel manner, I have done not so badly.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is--this is--\" Chet stared at the object in his hand; his tongue\r\ncould not be brought to speak the words. \"But what use? How can I get\r\nin? The gas--\"\r\n\r\n\"Cause and effect!\" stated Herr Doktor Kreiss of the Institute at\r\nVienna, and once more he seemed addressing a class and taking pleasure\r\nin his ability to dispense knowledge. \"It is the law of the universe.\r\n\r\n\"I perform an act. It is a cause--I have invoked the law. And the\r\neffects go out like circling waves in an endless ocean of time forever\r\nbeyond our reach.\r\n\r\n\"But we can do other acts, produce other causes, and sometimes we can\r\nneutralize thereby the effects of the first. I do that now.\" He picked\r\nup the second bundle in its wrapping of leaves; it was heavy for him to\r\nmanage with his wounded arm. \"This is all that I have,\" he said! \"I must\r\nplace it surely.\r\n\r\n\"Go down toward the ship,\" he ordered. \"Wait where it is safe. Then\r\nwhen the gas ceases you will have but three minutes. Three\r\nminutes!--remember! Lose no time at the port!\"\r\n\r\nHe had reached the base of the hill of mud. He was on the windward side;\r\nabove him the fumerole was grunting and roaring. And, to Chet, the thin\r\nfigure, gaunt and ungainly and absurd in its wrappings of dilapidated\r\ngarments, became somehow tremendous, vaguely symbolic. He could not get\r\nit clearly, but there was something there of the cool, reasoning\r\nsureness of science itself--an indomitable pressing on toward whatever\r\ngoal the law might lead one to; but Kreiss was human as well. He stopped\r\nonce and looked about him.\r\n\r\n\"A laboratory--this world!\" he exclaimed. \"Virgin! Untouched!... So much\r\nto be learned; so much to be done! And mine would have been the glory\r\nand fame of it!\"\r\n\r\nHe turned hesitantly, almost apologetically, toward Chet standing\r\nmotionless and unspeaking with the wonder of this turn of events.\r\n\r\n\"Should you be so fortunate as to survive,\" began Kreiss, \"perhaps you\r\nwould be so kind--my name--I would not want it lost.\" He straightened\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Go!\" he ordered. \"Get as near as you can!\" His feet were climbing\r\nsteadily up the slippery ascent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe faintest breath of the gas warned Chet back. Almost infinitely\r\ndiluted, it still set him choking while the tears streamed down his\r\nface. But he worked his way as near the ship as he dared, and he saw\r\nthrough the tears that still blinded his stinging eyes the tall figure\r\nof Kreiss as he reached the top.\r\n\r\nA table of steaming mud was there, and Kreiss was sinking into it as he\r\nstruggled forward. At the center was a hot throat where fumes like a\r\nbreath from hell roared and choked with the strangling of its own gas.\r\nThe figure writhed as a whirl of green enveloped it, threw itself\r\nforward. From one outstretched hand an object fell toward the throat;\r\nits leafy wrapping was whipped sharply for an instant by the coughing\r\nbreath....\r\n\r\nAnd then, where the hot blast had been, and the forming clouds and the\r\nerupting mud, was a pillar of fire--a white flame that thundered into\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nStraight and clean, like the sword of some guardian angel, it stood\r\nerect--a line of dazzling light in a darkening sky. And the fumes of\r\ngreen had vanished at its touch.\r\n\r\nBut Kreiss! Chet found himself running toward the fumerole. He must save\r\nhim, drag him back. Then he knew with a certainty that admitted of no\r\nquestion that for Kreiss there was no help: that for this man of science\r\nthe laws of cause and effect were no longer operative on the plane of\r\nEarth. The heat would have killed him, but the enveloping gas must have\r\nreached him first. And he had sacrificed himself for what?--that he,\r\nChet, might reach the ship!... Before Chet's eyes was a silvery cylinder\r\nwhose closed port was plainly marked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNo gas now! No glint of green! The way was clear, and the slim figure of\r\nChet Bullard was checked in its rush toward a mound of mud and the body\r\nof a man that lay next to a blasting column of flame; he turned instead\r\nto throw himself through the clean air toward the ship that was free of\r\ngas.\r\n\r\n\"Three minutes!\" This was what Kreiss had said; this was the allotted\r\ntime. In three minutes he must reach the ship, force open the long\r\nunused port, get inside--!\r\n\r\nAt one side, across the level lava rock he saw Towahg. The savage was\r\nrunning at top speed. He had thrown away his bow, dropping it lest it\r\nimpede his flight from this terrifying witchcraft he had seen. There had\r\nbeen a witch-doctor in Towahg's tribe; the savage knew sorcery when he\r\nsaw it. But never had his witch-doctor changed green gas to a column of\r\nfire; and this white sorcerer, Kreiss, powerful as he was, had been\r\nstruck down by the fire-god before Towahg's eyes. Towahg ran as if the\r\nroaring finger of flame might reach after him at any instant.\r\n\r\nChet saw this in a glance--knew the reason for the black's desertion:\r\nthen lost all thought of him and of Kreiss and even of the waiting ship.\r\nFor, in the same glance, he saw, springing from behind a lava block, the\r\nheavy figure of a man.\r\n\r\nBlack as any ape, hairy of face, roaring strange oaths, the man threw\r\nhimself upon Chet! It was Schwartzmann; and, mingled with profane\r\nexclamations, were the words: \"the ship--und I take it for mineself!\"\r\nAnd his heavy body hurled itself down upon the lighter man in the\r\ninstant that Chet drew his pistol.\r\n\r\nBut, tearing through Chet's mind, was no rage against this man as an\r\nenemy in himself; he thought only of Kreiss' words; \"Three minutes! Lose\r\nno time at the port!\" And now the brave sacrifice! It would be in vain.\r\nHe twisted himself about, so that his shoulder might receive the human\r\nprojectile that was crashing upon him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n_The Might of the \"Master\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs with other measures of matters earthly, time is a relative gauge.\r\nNowhere is this more apparent than in those moments of mental stress\r\nwhen time passes in a flash or, conversely, drags each lagging minute\r\ninto hours of timeless length.\r\n\r\n\"Three minutes!\" The words clanged and reverberated through Chet's\r\nbrain. And it seemed, as he strained and struggled and was forced\r\nbackward and yet backward by the weight of his antagonist, that those\r\nthree minutes had long since passed, and other three's without end.\r\n\r\nThe enemy's leaping body had been upon him before the detonite pistol\r\nwas half drawn. And now he fought desperately; he felt only the jar of\r\nblows that landed on his half-covered face. There was no sting or pain,\r\nonly the crashing thud that made strange clamor and confusion in his\r\nhead. But he ducked and blocked awkwardly with the one arm that held the\r\npackage Kreiss had given him, while the other hand that gripped the\r\npistol was twisted behind him.\r\n\r\nNo chance here for clever blocking, no room for quick foot-work; weight\r\nwas telling, and the weight was all in favor of his big opponent.\r\n\r\nChet knew that possession of the gun was vital. Flashingly it came to\r\nhim that Schwartzmann had not fired: his pistol, then, was lost, or he\r\nwas out of ammunition. And now Chet's hand that held the gun with the\r\nsix precious charges of detonite was fast in the clutch of a huge paw,\r\nand the pain of that twisted arm was sending searing flashes to his\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _With the free hand he shot over a blow._]\r\n\r\nA twist of the body, and the pain relaxed. He dropped the leaf-wrapped\r\npackage to the ground, and, with the free hand, shot over a blow that\r\nbrought a grunt of pain from Schwartzmann and a gush of blood that\r\nsmeared the black, hairy face. He took one stiff jolt himself on his\r\nhalf-averted head that he might counter with another to flatten that\r\ncrushed and painful nose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor one brief instant Schwartzmann's free hand was raised protectingly\r\nto his face so contorted with rage; for one brief instant, below that\r\nbig fist, there showed the contour of a jaw; and, with every ounce of\r\nweight that Chet could put into the swing, he came up from under in that\r\nsame instant with a smashing left that connected with the exposed jaw.\r\n\r\nThe hand that gripped his gun-hand did not let go completely, but Chet\r\nfelt the steel-hard rigidity of that arm relax, and abruptly he knew\r\nthat he could beat this man down if he once got clear. He didn't need\r\nthe gun; he needed only to get both hands free. And, despite the arm\r\nthat clung and swung with his, he managed to wrench himself into a\r\nsideways throw of his whole body at the instant he unclosed his hand.\r\nThe slim barrel of the detonite pistol described a flashing arc through\r\nthe clear air and clattered along the lava underneath a big shining\r\nsurface of metal.\r\n\r\nAnd then, in a breath-taking flash of understanding, Chet knew.\r\n\r\nHe knew he was beside the ship: he saw the closed port and the\r\nself-retracting lever that would open it, and he saw it through clear\r\nair where no taint of the green gas was apparent.\r\n\r\nHe was certain that he had been fighting for an interminable time, yet\r\nbefore him the air was clear. It was impossible, but true; and he threw\r\nthe half-stunned body of Schwartzmann from him. Then, instead of\r\nfollowing it with punishing blows, he sprang toward the port.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith one hand on the lever, he turned to dart a glance toward the column\r\nof flame. It was gone! And in its place came green, billowing gas that\r\nwas coughed and spewed into the air to be caught up in the steady breeze\r\nthat blew directly from the vent.\r\n\r\nBeside him, his antagonist, prone on the lava floor, dragged himself\r\nbeneath the ship to reach for the gun. Chet paid no heed; his every\r\nthought--his whole being, it seemed--was focused upon the lever that\r\nturned so slowly, that let fall, at last, a lock whose releasing\r\nmechanism clanged loudly through the metal wall.\r\n\r\nThe outer port, a thin door that served only to streamline the opening,\r\nswung open under Chet's hand. And, while he held his breath till his\r\npumping heart set his whole body to pulsing, he drew himself into the\r\nship as the green cloud wrapped thickly about. But first he bent to\r\ngrasp the knotted vines and leathery leaves that enclosed a bulky\r\npackage.\r\n\r\nThe port closed silently upon its soft-faced gasket; it was gas-tight\r\nwhen no pressure was applied. And Chet stumbled and reached blindly till\r\nhe fell beside the huge inner compression port, while the breath of gas\r\nthat had touched him tore with ripping talons at his throat.\r\n\r\nMore measureless time--whether hours or minutes Chet could never have\r\ntold--and he sat upright and tried to believe the utterly incredible\r\nstory that his eyes were telling.\r\n\r\nA short passage and a control room beyond! It was just as they had left\r\nit; was it days or years before? The shattered control cage was there,\r\nthe familiar instrument board, the very bar of metal with which he had\r\nwrought such havoc in that wild moment of demolition; it was all crystal\r\nclear under the flooding light of the nitron illuminator!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYes, it was true! He, Chet Bullard, was staring wide-eyed at his own\r\ncontrol-room, in his own ship--his and Walt's--and he was alone! The\r\nremembrance of Walt and Diane, and the realization that now, by some\r\nmiracle, he might be of help, brought him to his feet.\r\n\r\nHe sprang toward a lookout where the last light of day was gone and a\r\nmonstrous moon shone down upon a world of ghastly green. Yet, through\r\nthe gas, every detail of the world outside showed clear; even the giant\r\nfumerole that had been the funeral pyre of a man of science; even the\r\nmound of ashes at its top which the moving air was blowing in dusty\r\npuffs until spouting mud fell back to hide them from sight.\r\n\r\nChet cursed the gas for the dimness that clouded his eyes, and he rubbed\r\nat them savagely as he turned and walked to a side lookout.\r\n\r\nThrough the riot of impressions of the fight outside the port, he had\r\nknown that there was a human body over which he stumbled at times. He\r\nsaw it now--the body of Schwartzmann's henchman, killed these long weeks\r\nbefore but preserved in the ceaseless flow of gas.\r\n\r\nBut now, sprawled across it, was another and bulkier shape. Sightless\r\neyes stared upward from a face turned to the cruel gas clouds and the\r\nhideous green moon above. The mouth sagged open in a black, bearded\r\nface, and one hand still clutched a pistol. It would have shattered his\r\nhuman opponent had the man been given an instant more, but against the\r\nenemy that rolled down and overwhelmed him in billowing clouds no weapon\r\ncould prevail. Herr Schwartzmann had fought his last fight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe package--the last gift of Kreiss--was still securely wrapped. It lay\r\non the metal floor. Chet stooped to lift it, to work at the knotted\r\nvines and lay off the thick wrappings of fibrous leaves, until he stood\r\nat last, under the white glare of the bubbling nitron bulb, to stare and\r\nstare wordlessly at the cage of metal bars in his hand.\r\n\r\nCrude!--yes; no finely polished mechanism, this; no one of the many\r\nconnection clips that the other had had, either. But Chet knew he could\r\nsolder on the hundreds of wires that made the nervous system of the\r\ncontrol and fed the current to the cage; and Kreiss had believed it\r\nwould work!\r\n\r\nThere was no thought of delay in Chet's mind, no waiting for daylight.\r\nThis was the fourth night since he had been in that place of horror,\r\nsince, above him in that Stygian pit, an inhuman satanic _something_ had\r\nsaid: \"... the captives ... a sacrifice to Vashta ... on the sixth\r\nnight....\"\r\n\r\nChet threw off the rags that once had been a trim khaki jacket and went\r\nfeverishly to work. And through the time that was left he drove himself\r\ndesperately. The hours so few and each hour so short! As he worked with\r\nseemingly countless strands of heavy cables, where each strand must be\r\ntraced back and its point of connection determined, he knew how long\r\neach dreadful minute must be for the two captives deep inside the Dark\r\nMoon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was as well, perhaps, that Chet did not have the power of distant\r\nsight, that he had no messenger like those from the pyramid who might\r\nhave gone down in that place and have sent him by mental television a\r\npicture of what was there. For he would have seen that which could have\r\nlent no clarity of vision to his deep-sunk eyes nor skill to the touch\r\nof fumbling, tired hands.\r\n\r\nWalt Harkness, no longer under hypnotic control, stood in a dim-lit room\r\ncarved from solid stone; stood, and stared despairingly at the\r\nsurrounding walls and at the pair of giant ape-men who guarded the one\r\ndoorway. And, clinging to his hand, was a girl; and she, too, had been\r\nreleased from the invisible bonds. She was speaking:\r\n\r\n\"No, Walter; we both saw it; it must be true. It was Chet's pistol; he\r\nwas there in that horrible place. And I will not give up. He will save\r\nus at the last; I know it! He will save us from the inhuman cruelty of\r\nthose terrible things. He shoots straight, Chet does; and he will give\r\nus a bullet apiece from the gun--the last kindly act of a friend. That's\r\nwhat the signal meant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why did he wait! Why didn't he do it then?\" Walt Harkness had made\r\nthe same demand a hundred times.\r\n\r\nAnd Diane answered as always: \"I don't know, Walter, I--don't--know.\"\r\n\r\nChet, cursing insanely at strange machines--equilibrators that\r\ncontrolled the longitudinal and transverse and rotative stability of the\r\nship and that refused to take their electrical charge--knew with\r\nhorrible certainty that the last night had come. But to the two humans,\r\nin the depths of this world where all knowledge of time was lost, the\r\nknowledge came only when they were dragged by their guards into a\r\nfamiliar room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApe-men were all about; they stared unwinkingly at the captives who\r\nstared back again in an effort to keep their eyes averted from the\r\nmonstrous repulsiveness on the platform above them, till their eyes were\r\ndrawn to meet the compelling gaze of the \"Master\" of a lost race.\r\n\r\nA something which, at first glance, seemed all head--this was the\r\n\"Master.\" The naked body, so skeleton-thin, was shrunken and distorted;\r\nit was withered and leathery-brown, like the aged parchment of mummified\r\nflesh. It was seated in a resplendent chair, whose radiating handles\r\nwere for its carrying; and, above it, the head, so incredibly repulsive,\r\nwas made more hideous by its travestied resemblance to human form.\r\n\r\nSoft, pulpy and wetly smooth--a ten-foot sac, enclosed in a membrane of\r\ndead gray shot through with flickerings of color that flamed and\r\ndied--the whole pulsing mass was supported in a sling of golden cloth.\r\nAnd, dominating it, in the center of that flabby forehead, a focal point\r\nfor the gaze of the horrified observers, was a single glassy and lidless\r\neye.\r\n\r\nCold, unchanging, entirely expressionless except for the fixed ferocity\r\nthat was there, the eye was a yellow disk of hate, where quivering lines\r\nof violet culminated in a central, flaming point; and that point of\r\nliving fire swelled prodigiously before their staring eyes. It seemed to\r\nexpand, to slowly draw their senses--their very selves--from their\r\nbodies, to plunge them down to annihilation in that fiery pit where a\r\nsoundless voice was speaking.\r\n\r\n\"Slaves! Apes! Take the captives to the great altar rock of Vashta, to\r\nthe Holy of Holies. The others you were permitted to slaughter for our\r\nfood; hold these two safely. For one shall die slowly for Vashta's\r\npleasure, and one shall live on for mine. And we would not have them\r\nunder our mental control, so guard them well; the offering is more\r\npleasing to Vashta when the blood in his cup flows from a creature\r\nunbound both in body and mind.\" And the two helpless humans found\r\nthemselves released from the flaming pit that became again but an eye in\r\nthe forehead of a loathsome thing.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were fully conscious of their surroundings as they were herded up\r\nthrough the pyramid and out into the night, where rough, calloused hands\r\nseized them and dragged them to a smooth table-top of rock that stood\r\nonly slightly above the ground before the great rocky pile. Stunned,\r\nwaiting dumbly, they saw swarming ape-men clustered like bees on the\r\nlower pyramid face; they saw coverings of stone being removed and a\r\ngreat recess laid open, while the ape-things dropped in awe before a\r\ngrotesque and horrible beast-head carved from a single piece of stone.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the beast shone with some cold, hidden light. They seemed\r\nfixed hungrily upon a cup in a distorted hand, and, though the cup was\r\nempty, there was promise of its being filled. For little sluices of\r\nstone sloped from the place where the captives stood, and they ended\r\nabove the cup so that the life-blood of a slaughtered creature, or a\r\nsacrificed man, might pour splashingly in, a streaming draught for this\r\nblood-thirsty god.\r\n\r\nThe arena filled with abominable life. Now, in the dark silence of a\r\nmoonless night, the cold stars shone down on a gathering of spectators,\r\nwild and unreal--nameless, spectral horrors of a blood-chilling dream.\r\n\r\nThe flat capstone of the pyramid was the resting place of the \"Master\";\r\nhis huge head showed pulpy and gray above the glittering gold of the\r\nmetal carrying-chair where a misshapen body was seated. Others like him\r\nhad poured from the pyramid, carried by thousands of slaves to their\r\nplaces about the arena.\r\n\r\nMonsters of prodigious strength, their forebears must have been, but\r\nthis degenerate product of evolutionary forces had lost all firmness of\r\nflesh. Their bodies, sacrificed for the development of the bulbous\r\nheads, were mere appendages, fit only for the propagation of their kind\r\nand for the digestion of human food.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe clean air of night was polluted with abominable odors as it swept\r\nover the exudations of those glistening, pulpy masses. To the two\r\nwaiting humans on the great sacrificial stone came a deadening of the\r\nsenses, as an executioner, armed with strange torturing instruments,\r\ndrew near. But, of the two, one, clinging hopelessly to the other,\r\nabruptly stifled the dry choking sobs in her throat to lift her head in\r\nsharp, listening alertness.\r\n\r\nWalt Harkness was speaking in a dead, emotionless tone:\r\n\r\n\"Chet has failed us; he is probably dead. Good-by, dear--\"\r\n\r\nBut his words were interrupted and smothered by a breathless, strangling\r\nvoice. Diane Delacouer, staring with agonized eyes into the night was\r\ncalling to him:\r\n\r\n\"Listen! Oh, listen! It's the ship, Walter! It's the ship! It's not the\r\nwind! I'm not dreaming nor insane!--Chet is coming with the ship!\"\r\n\r\nIt was as well that Chet Bullard could not see the two, could not hear\r\nthat voice, trembling and vibrant with an impossible, heart-gripping\r\nhope; and surely it was well that he could not share their emotions\r\nwhen, for them, the silence became faintly resonant, when the distant,\r\nhumming, drumming reverberation grew to a nerve-shattering roar, when\r\nthe black night was ripped apart by the passage of a meteor-ship that\r\nshrieked and thundered through the screaming air close above the arena,\r\nwhile, with the rock beneath them still shuddering from the blasting\r\nvoice of that full exhaust, the sky above burst into dazzling flame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor Chet in that control-room that was darkened that he might see the\r\nworld outside--Chet, grim and haggard and stained of face and with\r\nthin-drawn lips that bled unheeded where his teeth had clamped down on\r\nthem--Chet Bullard, Master Pilot of the World, had no thought nor\r\nemotion to spare for aught beyond the reach of his hand. He was throwing\r\nhis ship at a speed that was sheer suicide over a strange terrain\r\nflashing under and close below.\r\n\r\nHe overshot the target on the first try. The twin beams of his\r\nsearchlights picked up the dazzling black and white of the arena; it was\r\nbefore him!--under him!--lost far astern in one single instant that was\r\nended as it began. But his hand, ready on a release key, pressed as he\r\npassed, and the sky behind him turned blazing bright with the cloud of\r\nflare-dust that made white flame as it fell.\r\n\r\nSuch speed was not meant for close work; nor was a ship expected to hit\r\ndense air with a blast such as this on full. Even through the thick\r\ninsulated walls came a terrible scream. Like voices of humans in agony,\r\nthe tortured air shrieked its protest while Chet threw on the bow-blast\r\nto check them and slanted slowly, slowly upward in a great loop whose\r\ntremendous size was an indication of the speed and the slow turning that\r\nwas all Chet could stand and live through.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe came in more slowly the next time. Floodlights in the under-skin of\r\nthe ship were blazing white, and whiter yet were the star-flares that he\r\ndropped one after another. Brighter than the sunlight of the brightest\r\nday this globe had ever seen, the sky, ablaze with dazzling fire, shone\r\ndown in vivid splendor to drain every shadow and half-light and leave\r\nonly the hard contrast of black and white.\r\n\r\nIn the nose of the ship was a .50 caliber gun. Chet sprayed the pyramid\r\ntop, but it is doubtful if the two below heard the explosions. They must\r\nhave seen the whole cap of the mountain of rock vanish as if,\r\nfeather-light, it had been snatched up in a gust of wind. But perhaps\r\nthey had eyes only for each other and for a glittering, silvery ship\r\nthat came crashing toward the place where they stood, that checked\r\nitself on thunderous exhausts; then touched the hard floor of the arena\r\nas softly as the caress of a master hand on the controls.\r\n\r\nBut from them came no cry nor exclamation of joy; they were dazed, Chet\r\nsaw, when he threw open the port. They were walking slowly,\r\nunbelievingly, toward him till Diane faltered. Then Chet leaped forward\r\nto sweep the drooping, ragged figure up into his arms while he hustled\r\nHarkness ahead and closed the port upon them all. But, still haggard and\r\nstern of face, he left the fainting girl to Harkness' care while he\r\nsprang for a ball-control and a firing key that released a hail of\r\nlittle .50 caliber shells whose touch could plough the earth with the\r\nripping sword of an avenging god.\r\n\r\nAnd later--a pulverous mass where a huge pyramid had been; smoking rock\r\nin a great oval of shattered crumbling blocks; and, under all the cold\r\nlight of the stars, no sign of life but for a screaming, frantic mob of\r\nape-men, freed and fleeing from the broken bondage of masters now\r\ncrushed and dead!\r\n\r\nAll this Chet's straining, blood-shot eyes saw clearly before his hand\r\non the firing key relaxed, before he covered his eyes with trembling\r\nhands as realization of their own release rushed overwhelmingly upon\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were supplies of clothing in the ship--jackets, knee-length\r\ntrousers, silken blouses, boots, and even snug-fitting, fashionable\r\ncaps. Very unlike the ragged wanderers of the mountainous wastes were\r\nthe three who stood safely to windward of a spouting fumerole.\r\n\r\nMud, coughed hoarsely from a hot throat, and green, billowing\r\ngas!--there was nothing now to show that here was the scene of a\r\ncompanion's last moments. With heads bared to the steady breeze that had\r\nbeen their undoing, they stood silent for long minutes.\r\n\r\nBehind them, at a still safer distance, where no chance flicker of a\r\nfire-god's finger might strike him down as it had the white man, a black\r\nfigure danced absurdly from foot to foot and indulged in unexpected\r\ngyrations of joy.\r\n\r\nFor did not Towahg hold in one hand a most marvelous weapon of shining,\r\nkeen-edged metal, with a blade that was longer than his two hands? What\r\nmember of the tribe had ever seen such an indescribably glorious thing?\r\nAnd, lacking the words even to propound that question, Towahg spun\r\nhimself in still tighter spirals of ecstasy.\r\n\r\nThen there was the ax! Not made of stone but fashioned from the same\r\nmetal! And besides this a magic thing for which as yet there was not\r\neven a name! It made flashing reflections in the sun; and if one held it\r\njust so, and moved one's head before it, it showed a quite remarkably\r\nattractive face of a man who was more than half ape--though Towahg had\r\nnever yet been able to catch that man beyond the magic that the white\r\nmen called \"mirror.\"\r\n\r\nHe was still enthralled in his grotesque posturing when Diane looked\r\ndown from the floating ship.\r\n\r\n\"He'll be the Lord Chief Voodoo Man for the whole tribe,\" she said, and,\r\nfor the first time since they had stood at the fumerole, she managed to\r\nsmile. \"And now,\" she asked, \"are we off? What comes next?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChet's hand was on a metal ball in a crudely constructed cage of metal\r\nbars. He looked at Harkness, and, at the other's almost imperceptible\r\nnod, he moved the ball forward and up.\r\n\r\n\"We're off!\" Harkness agreed. \"Off for Earth--home! And it will look\r\ngood to us all. We will take up things where we left them when we were\r\ninterrupted: there's no Schwartzmann to fear now. We can show our ship\r\nto the world--revolutionize all lines of transportation; and we can\r\nplan--\"\r\n\r\nHe failed to finish the sentence. To his reaching vision there were,\r\nperhaps, more potentialities than he could compass in words.\r\n\r\nAnd Chet Bullard, fingering the triple star on his blouse--the insignia\r\nthat had gone with him through all his hopes and despairs--looked out\r\ninto space and smiled.\r\n\r\nBehind him a brilliant world went slowly dark; it became, after long\r\nwatching, a violet ring--then that was gone; the Dark Moon was lost in\r\nthe folds of enshrouding night. Ahead was an infinity of black space\r\nwhere only the distant stars struck sparks of fire in the dark. And\r\nstill he smiled, as if, looking into the unplumbed depths, he, too, made\r\nplans. But he moved the little ball within his hand and swung the bow\r\nsights to bear upon a glorious globe--a brilliant, welcome beacon.\r\n\r\n\"Home it is!\" he stated. \"We're on our way!\"\r\n\r\nBut there was needed the rising roar from astern that his words might\r\nhave meaning; it thundered sonorously its resounding hum in a crescendo\r\nof power that brooked no denial, that threw them out and onward through\r\nthe velvet dark.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe End.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Brood of the Dark Moon, by Charles Willard Diffin",
