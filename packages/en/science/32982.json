Taylor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1876, as Microscopist of the Department of Agriculture, I\r\nprepared, as a part of the exhibit of my Division at the Centennial\r\nExhibition at Philadelphia, a large collection of water-color drawings\r\nrepresenting leading types of the edible and poisonous mushrooms of the\r\nUnited States, together with representations of about nine hundred\r\nspecies of microscopic fungi detrimental to vegetation.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of the first collection I had the valuable assistance\r\nof Prof. Charles H. Peck, State Botanist of New York, and in the second\r\nthe hearty co-operation of Rev. M. J. Berkeley and Dr. M. C. Cook, the\r\neminent British mycologists.\r\n\r\nThe popular character of this exhibit attracted the attention of the\r\ngeneral public, and many letters were received at the Department showing\r\nan awakening interest in the study of fungi, particularly with regard to\r\nthe mushroom family, as to methods of cultivation, the means of\r\ndetermining the good from the unwholesome varieties, etc.\r\n\r\nMy first published paper on the subject of edible mushrooms, entitled\r\n\"Twelve Edible Mushrooms of the U. S.,\" appeared in the annual report of\r\nthe Department of Agriculture for 1885. This was followed by others to\r\nthe number of five, and as the demand for these reports increased,\r\nreprints were made and issued, by order of the Secretary of Agriculture,\r\nin pamphlet form, under the general title of \"Food Products.\" Numerous\r\neditions of these reprints were issued by the Department up to 1894.\r\nDuring the year 1894, and the first half of 1895, 36,600 of these\r\nreports were sent out by the Department, and the supply was exhausted.\r\nThey have been out of print for more than two years. It is in view of\r\nthis fact, and in response to a great and constant demand for these\r\npublications, that I have undertaken to publish a series of five\r\npamphlets on the edible and poisonous mushrooms of the United States,\r\nwhich shall embody the substance of the five pamphlets on \"Food\r\nProducts\" above alluded to, supplemented by new matter relating to\r\nclassification, general and specific, analytical tables of standard\r\nauthors, and a continuation of the chapters on structure, etc.\r\nAdditional plates, representing leading types of edible and poisonous\r\nmushrooms, will also be inserted in each number.\r\n\r\nIn the compilation and extension of this work I have the assistance of\r\nmy daughter, Miss A. Robena Taylor, who has given considerable attention\r\nto the study of fungi, and who has been my faithful coadjutor in the\r\nwork of collecting specimens, etc., for a number of years.\r\n\r\nFor valuable suggestions as to structural characteristics and methods of\r\nclassification I am especially indebted to Prof. Chas. H. Peck, of\r\nAlbany, New York, Dr. M. C. Cooke, of England, and Prof. P. A. Saccardo,\r\nof Italy.\r\n\r\nThe colored plates in pamphlet No. 1, together with a few of those which\r\nwill appear in the succeeding numbers of this series, are reproductions\r\nof those prepared, under my direct supervision, for the pamphlets\r\nentitled \"Food Products\" published by the Department of Agriculture and\r\nreferred to above.\r\n\r\n                                        THOMAS TAYLOR, M. D.\r\n\r\nMay 7, 1897.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRYPTOGAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cryptogamic or flowerless plants, _i. e._, those having neither\r\nstamens nor pistils, and which are propagated by spores, are divided,\r\naccording to Dr. Hooper, into the following four classes:--Pteridophyta\r\nor vascular acrogens, represented by the ferns, club-mosses, etc.;\r\nBryophyta or cellular acrogens, represented by the musci, scale-mosses,\r\netc.; Algae, represented by the \"Red Seaweeds,\" Diatomacae, etc.; Fungi or\r\nAmphigens, which include the molds, mildews, mushrooms, etc. The\r\nlichens, according to the \"Schwendener Hypotheses,\" consist of\r\nascigerous fungi parasitic on algae.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNGI.\r\n\r\nBotanists unite in describing the plants of this class as being\r\ndestitute of chlorophyll and of starch. These plants assume an infinite\r\nvariety of forms, and are propagated by spores which are individually so\r\nminute as to be scarcely perceptible to the naked eye. They are entirely\r\ncellular, and belong to the class Amphigens, which for the most part\r\nhave no determinate axe, and develop in every direction, in\r\ncontradistinction to the Acrogens, which develop from the summit,\r\npossessing an axe, leaves, vessels, etc.\r\n\r\nFungi are divided by systematists into two great classes:\r\n\r\n1. Sporifera, in which the spores are free, naked, or soon exposed.\r\n\r\n2. Sporidifera, in which the spores are not exposed, but instead are\r\nenclosed in minute cells or sacs, called asci.\r\n\r\nThese classes are again subdivided, according to the disposition of the\r\nspores and of the spore bearing surface, called the hymenium, into\r\nvarious families.\r\n\r\nThe sporiferous fungi are arranged into four families, viz:\r\n\r\n1. _Hymenomycetes_, in which the hymenium is free, mostly naked, or soon\r\nexposed. _Example, \"Common Meadow Mushroom.\"_\r\n\r\n2. _Gasteromycetes_, in which the hymenium is enclosed in a second case\r\nor wrapper, called a peridium, which ruptures when mature, thus\r\nreleasing the spores. _Example, Common Puff Ball._\r\n\r\n3. _Coniomycetes_, in which the spores are naked, mostly terminal on\r\ninconspicuous threads, free or enclosed in a perithecium. Dust-like\r\nfungi. _Example, Rust of Wheat._\r\n\r\n4. _Hyphomycetes_, in which the spores are naked on conspicuous threads,\r\nrarely compacted, Thread-like fungi. _Example, Blue Mold._\r\n\r\nOf these four subdivisions of the Sporifera, only the Hymenomycetes and\r\nthe Gasteromycetes contain plants of the mushroom family, and these two\r\ntogether constitute the class known as the Basidiomycetes. The chief\r\ndistinction of the Basidiomycetes is that the naked spores are borne on\r\nthe summits of certain supporting bodies, termed basidia. These basides\r\nare swollen, club-shaped cells, surmounted by four minute tubes or\r\nspore-bearers, called sterigmata, each of which carries a spore. See\r\nFigs. 3 and 4, Plate A.\r\n\r\nThese basides together with a series of elongated cells, termed\r\nparaphyses, packed closely together side by side, and intermixed with\r\nother sterile cells, called cystidia, constitute the spore-bearing\r\nsurface or hymenium of the plant.\r\n\r\nTo the naked eye this hymenium appears simply as a very thin smooth\r\nmembrane, but when a small portion of it is viewed through a microscope\r\nwith high powers its complex structure is readily observed and can be\r\ncarefully studied.\r\n\r\nThe _Sporidiferous_ fungi are represented by the families Physomycetes\r\nand Ascomycetes. The first of these consists wholly of microscopic\r\nfungi.\r\n\r\n_Ascomycetes._--In the plants of this family the spores are not\r\nsupported upon basidia, but instead are enclosed in minute sacs or asci\r\nformed from the fertile cells of a hymenium. In this connection it would\r\nbe well to state that Saccardo does not recognize the divisions\r\n_Sporifera_ and _Sporidifera_ by those names.\r\n\r\nThey are nearly the equivalent of Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes.\r\n\r\nWhat Cooke names Physomycetes, Saccardo calls Phycomyceteae, introducing\r\nit in his work between Gasteromyceteae and Myxomyceteae, which some\r\nmycologists consider somewhat out of place.\r\n\r\nSaccardo calls its asci (sacs which contain the spores) sporangia. He\r\ndoes not regard them as genuine asci, but as corresponding more to the\r\nperidium of the _Gasteromyceteae_ and _Myxomyceteae._\r\n\r\nPeck says that this group seems to present characters of both\r\nHyphomycetes and Ascomycetes, with a preponderance towards Hyphomycetes.\r\n\r\nIt is a small group, however, and since it consists wholly of\r\nmicroscopic fungi, need not be farther considered in this work.\r\n\r\nIn the Ascomycetes are included the sub-families Discomycetes,\r\nPyrenomycetes, and Tuberacei. Of these the Discomycetes and the\r\nTuberacei are the only groups which contain any of the mushrooms, and\r\nbut few of these are large enough or sufficiently tender to possess\r\nvalue as esculents. A good example of the first (Discomycetes) is found\r\nin the Morel, and of the second (Tuberacei) in the Truffle.\r\n\r\nIn the Discomycetes or \"disk fungi,\" the spores are produced in minute\r\nmembraneous sacs, each sac usually containing eight spores. These spore\r\nsacs are imbedded in the flesh of the exterior and upper surface of the\r\nmushroom cap.\r\n\r\nIn the four classes, Hymenomycetes, Gasteromycetes, Discomycetes, and\r\nTuberacei, therefore, are included all of the plants which are here\r\ndesignated under the generic term of \"mushrooms.\"\r\n\r\nSome idea of the relative numerical value of these classes may be\r\nobtained from the following figures given by the distinguished British\r\nmycologist, M. C. Cooke:\r\n\r\n    \"Hymenomyceteae--total number of described species    9,600\r\n     Gasteromycetae--  \"     \"    \"     \"        \"          650\r\n     Discomyceteae--   \"     \"    \"   known      \"        3,500\"\r\n\r\n(The Tuberacei comprise a very small group of subterranean fungi, and\r\ncomparatively few of the species are described.)\r\n\r\nSaccardo in his Sylloge gives a total of 42,000 described species of\r\nfungi of all classes, including the most minute. Of these the\r\nHymenomycetes include by far the largest number of edible mushrooms.\r\n\r\nThe family Hymenomycetes is divided into the following six orders:\r\nAgaricini, Polyporei, Hydnei, Thelephorei, Clavarei, Tremellini.\r\n\r\nIn the order Agaricini the hymenium is found on the under surface of the\r\nmushroom cap, covering pleats or gills, technically called lamellae.\r\nThese gills vary in character in the different genera, being \"persistent\r\nin such as the Agaricus, Russula, and Lentinus, deliquescent (melting)\r\nin Coprinus, Bolbitius, etc. The edge of the gills is acute in Agaricus,\r\nMarasmius, etc., but obtuse and vein-like in Cantharellus,\r\nlongitudinally channelled in Trogia, and splitting in Schyzophyllum.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Polyporei, pore-bearing mushrooms, the gills are replaced by\r\ntubes or pores. The tubes are little cylinders, long or short, pressed\r\none against another, forming by their union a layer on the under surface\r\nof the cap, and the sporiferous membrane or hymenium lines their inner\r\nwalls. Their upper end is always closed, while the lower extremity is\r\nopen to permit the outward passage of the spores. The tubes are\r\ngenerally joined together and are not easily disunited. They are free,\r\n_i. e._, separable, in the sole genus _Fistulina_. As regards their\r\nattachment to the cap, the tubes may be firmly adherent as in the genus\r\nPolyporus or easily detached in a single mass as in Boletus, the fleshy\r\nform of the order Polyporei. They frequently leave a circular space of\r\ngreater or less dimensions around the stem, or they adhere to or are\r\nprolonged upon it in such a manner that the orifices rise in tiers one\r\nabove another. The color of the tubes, although not offering as\r\ncharacteristic varieties as that of the gills, changes nevertheless\r\naccording to species and according to the age of the plant. The tubes\r\nmay sometimes be of a different color from their orifices, as in\r\n_Boletus luridus_. In some of the Boleti the color of the flesh is\r\nchanged on exposure to the air and the tubes often assume the same\r\ntints. The tubes, generally called pores, are sometimes closely adherent\r\nto the substance of the cap, which is often hard, corky, or coriaceous,\r\nas seen in most of the _Polyporei_.\r\n\r\nIn the Hydnei, spine-bearing mushrooms, the hymenium is seen covering\r\nthe spines or needle-like processes which take the place of gills in\r\nthis order, and which project from the under surface of the cap. These\r\nspines may be divided or entire, simple or ramified, and are formed of\r\nthe substance of the cap. In the early stages of development they appear\r\nlike small projecting points or papillae, those on the margin of the cap\r\nand at the apex of the stem being always less developed, frequently\r\nremaining in this rudimentary state. They are rounded in the species\r\nHydnum imbricatum, sometimes compressed in Hydnum repandum, sometimes\r\nterminating in hairs or filaments, as in Hydnum barba Jovis, or very\r\nmuch divided, as in Hydnum fimbriatum.\r\n\r\nIn the Clavarei, the whole plant consists of solid fleshy masses\r\nwithout any stem of a distinct substance, sometimes club-shaped,\r\nsometimes branched with the hymenium smoothly covering the entire\r\nsurface, never incrusting or coriaceous.\r\n\r\nIn the Thelephorei, the lower surface of the cap presents neither gills,\r\npores, nor spines, but instead the hymenium covers an uneven or slightly\r\nwrinkled surface, partially striate, sometimes obscurely papillose. The\r\nplants of this order assume a great variety of shape, from that of a\r\nperfect cup with a central stem to an irregularly and much branched\r\nfrond. They are generally dry and tough. Very few are recommended as\r\nedible. Prof. Peck says of this order that probably no edible species\r\nwill be found in any of its genera outside of the genus Craterellus.\r\n\r\nIn the order Tremellini we have a great departure from the character of\r\nthe substance, external appearance, and internal structure of the other\r\norders of the Hymenomycetes. The substance is gelatinous; the form is\r\nlobed, folded, or convolute, often resembling the brain of some animal.\r\nIt is uniformly composed throughout of a colorless mucilage, with no\r\nappreciable texture, in which are distributed very fine, diversely\r\nbranched, and anastomosing filaments. Towards the surface the ultimate\r\nbranches of this filamentous network give birth to globular cells, both\r\nat their summits and laterally, which attain a comparatively large size.\r\nThese cells are filled with a protoplasm, to which the plant owes its\r\ncolor. The fertile threads are not compacted into a true hymenium.\r\n\r\nRepresentative types of the above-described orders of the Hymenomycetes\r\nare shown in Plate B. The various genera, and species of these orders,\r\nwill be described more in detail in connection with the species\r\nillustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that botanists of various countries, writing in\r\ndiverse languages, have for more than a century been engaged in\r\ndescribing the fungi of their respective countries, with their work\r\nfrequently unknown to one another, it is not surprising that there has\r\nbeen constant revision, or that many changes have been made in the way\r\nof classification and nomenclature which to the amateur student are\r\noften confusing.\r\n\r\nThe classification by the pioneer mycologist, Elias Fries, as presented\r\nin his several works on fungi, ignored all microscopical characters, and\r\nSaccardo's classification, as presented in his _Sylloge Fungorum_, was\r\nthe first complete system offered in its place.\r\n\r\nSaccardo, in 1882, commenced his Sylloge, of which not less than twelve\r\nvolumes have been published. In Saccardo's system of classification the\r\nsix orders of the Hymenomycetes are not essentially different in their\r\narrangement from that of Fries, although Saccardo has raised all the\r\nsubgenera of Agaricus to the rank of genera, and then altered their\r\nsequence so as to bring them into four sections, distinguished by the\r\ncolor of their spores. Having raised the old subgenera of Fries to\r\ngeneric rank, Saccardo found it necessary to limit the application of\r\nthe term Agaricus to the group of fungi to which it was originally\r\napplied by Linnaeus, viz., the common field mushroom Agaricus campester,\r\nand its allies, represented by Agaricus arvensis, Agaricus Rodmani,\r\netc., or, as Prof. Peck more definitely states it, \"to those of the\r\ngilled mushrooms which have brown spores, free gills, a stem bearing a\r\nring, gills generally pink-colored in the early stage, and brownish\r\nblack when fully matured.\" M. C. Cooke, the distinguished English\r\nmycologist, prefers to retain the _genus Agaricus_ with its original\r\nsubgenera intact, succeeded by the other genera of Agaricini, as in the\r\nHymenomycetes Europei of Fries, giving as his reason the belief \"that\r\nfor purposes of classification features should be taken which are\r\npresent and evident in the specimens themselves, and are not dependent\r\non any of their life-history which cannot be presented in the\r\nherbarium.\"\r\n\r\nIn a work such as the present, which is designed to be popular in\r\ncharacter rather than purely technical, it is deemed advisable to select\r\nas a basis for classification that system which is most accessible to\r\nreference by the general reading public. Saccardo's Sylloge, while\r\nexhaustive in character and of inestimable value to the mycologist, is\r\nwritten in Latin, and is, moreover, a very expensive work--facts which\r\nrender it practically unavailable to the general public.\r\n\r\nIn the compilation of this series of pamphlets I have adopted the\r\nclassification of M. C. Cooke, which, as regards the Hymenomycetes, the\r\nfamily containing most of the fleshy fungi, is, with exceptions noted,\r\nin accord with that of Saccardo. M. C. Cooke's hand-book of fungi is of\r\nconvenient size and form for ready reference.\r\n\r\nFor the convenience, however, of those who may wish to familiarize\r\nthemselves with both systems, a synopsis of _Saccardo's Genera_ of\r\nHymenomycetes will be given later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE AGARICINI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy far the greater number of the Agaricini have both cap and stem. The\r\nform of the cap, as well as that of the stem, varies somewhat in the\r\ndifferent genera and species. Those which are terrestrial in habit are\r\ngenerally of an umbrella-like shape, while those which grow upon trees\r\nand decayed tree-stumps are apt to be one-sided or semi-spherical.\r\n\r\nIn many of the parasitical mushrooms the stem is absent. Where the stem\r\nis present it is either an interrupted continuation of the hymenophore\r\nor fleshy substance of the cap, or else is supported separately as a\r\npillar on which the cap rests, a more or less distinct line of\r\ndemarcation showing where the fibers terminate. Sometimes it is quite\r\neasily detached from the cap socket, as in the Lepiota procerus. It may\r\nbe hollow or stuffed, solid or fibrillose. It varies in length and\r\nthickness. In some species it is smooth and polished, in others rough\r\nand hairy, reticulated, etc., sometimes tapering, sometimes distinctly\r\nbulbous at the base.\r\n\r\nThe spores of the species differ in color and are usually globular or\r\noblong in shape. All of these characteristics assist in determining the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM GILLS.\r\n\r\nMushroom gills, or lamellae, anatomically considered, are composed,\r\nfirst, of a central portion, a prolongation of the hymenophore or flesh\r\nof the cap, more or less dense, sometimes so thin as to be scarcely\r\nperceptible; second, the hymenium or spore-bearing membrane covering the\r\nsurfaces of this prolonged hymenophore. They are vertical, simple,\r\nequal, respectively, or more frequently alternating with shorter gills.\r\nThey are often evanescent and putrescent, sometimes liquefying\r\naltogether. Their color is usually different from the upper surface of\r\nthe cap, not always similar to that of the spores borne upon them, at\r\nleast in youth; with age, however, they usually assume the color of the\r\nmature spore. The change of color of the gills according to the age of\r\nthe plant is very important in the study of the Agaricini; it accounts\r\nfor the white gills of certain species in youth, the pink in maturity,\r\nand the brown when aged.\r\n\r\nThe end of the gill nearest the stalk of the plant is termed the\r\nposterior extremity; the opposite end, the anterior extremity. In most\r\nof the Agaricini the gills are unequal. Some extend from the margin to\r\nabout half the space between it and the stem; others are still shorter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VOLVA.\r\n\r\nThe volva is a membrane which envelops the entire plant in embryo,\r\ngiving it the appearance of an egg. It originates at the base of the\r\nmushroom and furnishes it, during its foetal life, with the means of\r\nsupport and nourishment. Its texture is so delicate that it generally\r\ndisappears, leaving very little trace of its existence on the adult\r\nplant. In many of the volvate species this organ exists only so long as\r\nthey are under ground, and some mycologists restrict the term \"volvati\"\r\nto such only as retain it afterwards. As the young plant expands it\r\nbreaks through the top of this volva or wrapper, and, emerging, carries\r\nwith it patches of the membrane on the upper surface of the cap. These\r\nare more or less prominent, numerous, and thick, sometimes irregularly\r\ndisposed, sometimes regularly in the form of plates, warts, etc. At the\r\nbase of the stem of the mushroom the remains of the volva are seen in\r\nthe form of a sort of wrapper. This is more or less ample, thick, and\r\nascending. It is called _free_ when it is loose or easily detached from\r\nthe stem, and _congenital_ when it cannot be separated from it without\r\nlaceration. In some species it is distinctly membranous, and in others\r\nfloccose, and friable in character, sometimes appearing in ridges as a\r\nmere border, at others broken up into scales, and, as the plant matures,\r\nwholly disappearing. The volva is a feature of great importance in the\r\nstudy of the Agaricini, of the subgenera Amanita, Volvaria, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MUSHROOM VEIL.\r\n\r\nThe veil is not a constant feature in the Agaricini, at least it is not\r\nalways visible. When present it consists of a membrane which extends\r\nfrom the margin of the cap to the stem, veiling or protecting the gills.\r\nThis membrane, called the cortina, has given its name to a numerous and\r\nimportant class of mushrooms (the _Cortinarias_). It is generally\r\nwhite, soft, slightly spongy, cottony, at times fibrillose or even\r\nslightly fibrous, again in texture comparable to the spider's web, and\r\nmay be even powdery or glutinous. It exists intact only in the youth of\r\nthe plant. It is not visible in the developing mushroom, at least while\r\nthe cap is closely pressed against the stem, but as the cap expands the\r\nmembrane extends and finally breaks, leaving in some species its\r\nremnants upon the margin of the cap and upon the stem in the usual form\r\nof a ring or a mere zone. When the stem is not ringed the veil rises\r\nhigh upon the stalk, stretches across to meet the edges of the cap, and\r\nis afterwards reflected back over its whole surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM SPORES AND MYCELIUM.\r\n\r\nThe spore is the reproductive organ of the mushroom. It differs from the\r\nseed of the flowering plant in being destitute of an apparent embryo. A\r\nseed contains a plantlet which develops as such. A spore is a minute\r\ncell containing a nucleus or living germ, the reproductive cell germ\r\ncalled by some authors the germinating granule. This in turn throws out\r\na highly elongated process consisting of a series of thread-like cells\r\nbranching longitudinally and laterally, at length bifurcating and\r\nanastomosing the mass, forming the vegetative process known as mycelium\r\nor mushroom spawn.\r\n\r\nOn this mycelium, at intervals, appear knob-like bodies, called\r\ntubercles, from which the mushrooms spring and from which they derive\r\ntheir nourishment. See Fig. 5, Plate A.\r\n\r\nWhere the conditions have been unfavorable this mycelium has been known\r\nto grow for years without bearing fruit.\r\n\r\nMushroom spores are very variable in size, shape, and color, but are\r\ngenerally constant at maturity in the same genus. Their shape, almost\r\nalways spherical in the young plant, becomes ovate, ellipsoidal,\r\nfusiform, reniform, smooth, stellate, sometimes tuberculate, or remains\r\nglobose. This feature, varying thus with the age of the plant, should be\r\nstudied in the mature plant.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYCELIUM.\r\n\r\nDe Leveille has thus defined mycelium: \"Filaments at first simple, then\r\nmore or less complicated, resulting from the vegetation of the spores\r\nand serving as roots to the mushroom.\"\r\n\r\nThe mycelium of mushrooms or the mushroom spawn is usually white, but is\r\nalso found yellow, and even red. It is distinguished by some writers as\r\nnematoid, fibrous, hymenoid, scleroid or tuberculous, and malacoid. The\r\nnematoid mycelium is the most common. Creeping along on the surface of\r\nthe earth, penetrating it to a greater or less depth, developing in\r\nmanure among the debris of leaves or decayed branches, always protected\r\nfrom the light, it presently consists of very delicate filamentous cells\r\nmore or less loosely interwoven, divided, anastomosing in every\r\ndirection and often of considerable extent.\r\n\r\nIts presence is sometimes difficult to detect without the use of the\r\nmicroscope, either on account of its delicacy or because of its being\r\nintermingled with the organic tissues in which it has developed.\r\n\r\nSometimes mycelium unites in bundles more or less thick and branched.\r\nThis has been called the fibrous mycelium. Where the filaments\r\nintercross closely, are felted, and inclined to form a membrane, it is\r\nhymenoid mycelium. Where the filaments are so small and close that they\r\nform very compact bodies, constituting those solid irregular products\r\ncalled sclerotium, it is scleroid or tuberculous mycelium. With malacoid\r\nmycelium we have nothing to do in this paper. It is a soft, pulpy,\r\nfleshy mycelium.\r\n\r\nSystematists have divided the Agaricini into groups according to the\r\ncolor of their spores. These groups are defined as follows by various\r\nauthors:\r\n\r\n    According to--\r\n\r\n    Elias Fries, 5 groups: _Leucosporus_, white; _Hyporhodius_, pink;\r\n    _Cortinaria_, ochraceous; _Derminus_, rust; _Pratella_, purplish\r\n    black.\r\n\r\n    Rev. J. M. Berkeley, 5 groups: Very frequently pure white, but\r\n    presenting also pink, various tints of brown, from yellowish and\r\n    rufous to dark bister, purple-black, and finally black;\r\n    _Leucospori_, white; _Hyporhodii_, salmon; _Dermini_, ferruginous;\r\n    _Pratellae_, brown; _Coprinarius_, black.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Badham, 6 groups: Pure white or a yellow tinge on drying; brown;\r\n    yellow; pink; purple; purple-black; some pass successively from pink\r\n    to purple and from purple to purple-black.\r\n\r\n    Mrs. Hussey, 11 shades: White; rose; pale ocher; olivaceous-ocher;\r\n    reddish-ocher; ochraceous; yellowish olive-green; dull brown;\r\n    scarcely ferruginous; snuff-color; very dark brown.\r\n\r\n    Hogg & Johnson, 5 groups: _Leucosporei_, white; _Hyporhodii_,\r\n    salmon; _Dermini_, rusty; _Pratellae_, purplish-brown; _Coprinarii_,\r\n    black.\r\n\r\n    C. Gillet, 7 shades: White; pink; ochraceous; yellow; ferruginous;\r\n    black or purplish black; round, ovate, elongated, or fusiform,\r\n    smooth, tuberculate or irregular, simple or composite, transparent\r\n    or nebulous, etc.\r\n\r\n    Jules Bel, 5 groups: White; pink; red; brown; black.\r\n\r\n    Dr. Gautier, 5 shades: White; pink; brown; purplish-brown; black.\r\n\r\n    Constantin & Dufour, 5 groups: White; pink; ochraceous;\r\n    brownish-purple; black.\r\n\r\n    J. P. Barla, 7 groups: _Leucosporii_, white; _Hyporhodii_, pink;\r\n    _Cortinariae_, ochraceous; _Dermini_, rust; _Pratellae_,\r\n    purplish-black; _Coprinarii_, blackish; _Coprini_ and _Gomphi_,\r\n    dense black.\r\n\r\n    L. Boyer, 5 groups, 11 shades: White to cream yellow; pale pink to\r\n    ochraceous yellow; bay or red brown to brown or blackish bister;\r\n    rust color, cinnamon or light yellow.\r\n\r\n    W. D. Hay, 5 groups: White; pink; brown; purple; black.\r\n\r\n    C. H. Peck, 5 groups: _Leucosporii_, white; _Hyporhodii_, salmon;\r\n    _Dermini_, rust; _Pratellae_, brown; _Coprinarii_, black.\r\n\r\n    Saccardo divides the Agaricini into four sections, according to the\r\n    color of their spores, as follows: Spores brown, purplish brown or\r\n    black, _Melanosporae_; spores ochraceous or rusty ochraceous,\r\n    _Ochrosporae_; spores rosy or pinkish, _Rhodosporae_; spores white,\r\n    whitish or pale yellow, _Leucosporae_.\r\n\r\n    Dr. M. C. Cooke, 5 groups: _Leucospori_, white or yellowish;\r\n    _Hyporhodii_, rosy or salmon color; _Dermini_, brown, sometimes\r\n    reddish or yellowish brown; _Pratellae_, purple, sometimes brownish\r\n    purple, dark purple, or dark brown; _Coprinarii_, black or nearly\r\n    so.\r\n\r\nThese shades are somewhat different from the colors of the mushrooms'\r\ngills, so that, when it is of importance to determine exactly the color\r\nof the spore in the identification of a species, we may without recourse\r\nto the microscope cut off the stem of an adult plant on a level with the\r\ngills and place the under surface of the cap upon a leaf of white paper\r\nif a dark-spored species, and upon a sheet of black paper if the spores\r\nare light. At the expiration of a few hours we will find, on lifting the\r\ncap, a bed of the shed spores which will represent their exact shade.\r\nThese may be removed to a glass slide and their size and form determined\r\nby means of the microscope.\r\n\r\nIn the present work Dr. M. C. Cooke's grouping of the spore series is\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nETYMOLOGY OF THE WORD \"MUSHROOM.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious opinions have been offered as to the derivation of the word\r\n\"mushroom.\" According to Hay, it probably had its origin in a\r\ncombination of the two Welsh words _maes_, a field, and _rhum_, a knob,\r\nwhich by gradual corruption have become _mushroom_. Some writers on the\r\nother hand regard it as a corruption of _mousseron_, a name specifically\r\napplied by the French to those mushrooms which are found growing in\r\nmossy places. But it seems to be of older usage than such a derivation\r\nwould imply, and therefore the first explanation seems the more likely\r\nto be correct.\r\n\r\nIn England the term \"mushroom\" has been most commonly applied to the\r\n\"meadow mushroom,\" that being the one best known; but English-speaking\r\nmycologists now apply it generically very much as the French do the term\r\n\"champignon,\" while the name \"champignon\" is restricted in England to\r\nthe Marasmius oreades, or \"Fairy Ring\" mushroom.\r\n\r\nBerkeley says the French word \"champignon\" was originally scarcely of\r\nwider signification than our word \"mushroom,\" though now classical in\r\nthe sense of fleshy fungi generally. The German word _Pilz_ (a\r\ncorruption of Boletus) is used to denote the softer kinds by some German\r\nauthors. Constant and Dufour, in their recently published Atlas des\r\nChampignons, include types of a great variety of mushrooms.\r\n\r\nHay contends that the pernicious nick-name \"toad-stool\" has not the\r\nderivation supposed, but that the first part of the word is the Saxon or\r\nold English \"tod,\" meaning a bunch, cluster, or bush, the form of many\r\nterrestrial fungi suggesting it. The second syllable, \"stool,\" is easily\r\nsupplied. \"The erroneous idea of connecting toads with these plants,\"\r\nsays Hay, \"seems to be due to Spenser, or to some poet, possibly, before\r\nhis time.\" Spenser speaks of the loathed paddocks, \"paddock\" then being\r\nthe name given in England to the frog, afterwards corrupted to \"paddic,\"\r\nand once received, readily converted by the Scotch into \"puddick-stool.\"\r\nIt would seem, therefore, from the foregoing, that the term \"toad-stool\"\r\ncan have no proper relation to mushrooms, whether edible or poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe three mushrooms illustrated and described in this pamphlet, Plates\r\nI, II, and III, are of the order Agaricini or gilled mushrooms. They are\r\nwell-defined types and of wide geographical distribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD VALUE OF MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nRollrausch and Siegel, who claim to have made exhaustive investigations\r\ninto the food values of mushrooms, state that \"many species deserve to\r\nbe placed beside meat as sources of nitrogenous nutriment,\" and their\r\nanalysis, if correct, fully bears out the statement. They find in 100\r\nparts of dried _Morchella esculenta_ 35.18 per cent. of protein; in\r\n_Helvella esculenta_, 26.31 per cent. of protein, from 46 to 49 per\r\ncent. of potassium salts and phosphoric acid, 2.3 per cent. of fatty\r\nmatter, and a considerable quantity of sugar. The _Boletus edulis_ they\r\nrepresent as containing in 100 parts of the dried substance 22.82 per\r\ncent. of protein. The nitrogenous values of different foods as compared\r\nwith the mushroom are stated as follows: \"Protein substances calculated\r\nfor 100 parts of bread, 8.03; of oatmeal, 9.74; of barley bread, 6.39;\r\nof leguminous fruits, 27.05; of potatoes, 4.85; of mushrooms, 33.0.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to Schlossberger and Depping, in 100 grams of dried mushrooms\r\nthey found the following proportions of nitrogenous substances:\r\n\r\n        -----------------------+--------\r\n          Varieties.           | Grains.\r\n                               |\r\n        Chanterelles           |  3.22\r\n        Certain Russulas       |  4.25\r\n        Lactarius deliciosus   |  4.68\r\n        Boletus edulis         |  4.25\r\n        Meadow mushroom        |  7.26\r\n        -----------------------+--------\r\n\r\nBut all chemists are not agreed as to these proportions. For instance,\r\nLefort has found 3.51 grains of nitrogenous matter in the cap of\r\n_Agaricus campestris_, 2.1 grains in the gills and only 0.34 of a grain\r\nin the stem. Payen has found 4.68 grains in _Agaricus campestris_, 4.4\r\ngrains in the common Morel (_Morchella esculenta_), 9.96 grains in the\r\nwhite truffle, and 8.76 grains in the black.\r\n\r\nA much larger proportion of the various kinds of mushrooms are edible\r\nthan is generally supposed, but a prejudice has grown up concerning them\r\nin this country which it will take some time to eradicate.\r\nNotwithstanding the occurrence of occasional fatal accidents through the\r\ninadvertent eating of poisonous species, fungi are largely consumed both\r\nby savage and civilized man in all parts of the world, and while they\r\ncontribute so considerable a portion of the food product of the world we\r\nmay be sure their value will not be permanently overlooked in the United\r\nStates, especially when we consider our large accessions of population\r\nfrom countries in which the mushroom is a familiar and much prized\r\nedible. In Italy the value of the mushroom as an article of diet has\r\nlong been understood and appreciated. Pliny, Galen, and Dioscorides\r\nmention various esculent species, notably varieties of the truffle, the\r\nboletus and the puff-ball, and Vittadini writes enthusiastically of the\r\ngastronomic qualities of a large number of species. Of late years large\r\nquantities have been sold in the Italian markets. Quantities of\r\nmushrooms are also consumed in Germany, Hungary, Russia, France, and\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nDarwin speaks of Terra del Fuego as the only country where cryptogamic\r\nplants form a staple article of food. A bright-yellow fungus allied to\r\n_Bulgarin_ forms, with shellfish, the staple food of the Fuegians. In\r\nEngland the common meadow mushroom _Agaricus campestris_ is quite well\r\nknown and used to a considerable extent among the people, but there is\r\nnot that general knowledge of and use of other species which obtains in\r\nContinental Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the English-speaking countries much has been done by the Rev. M. J.\r\nBerkeley, Dr. M. C. Cooke, Worthington G. Smith, Rev. John Stevenson,\r\nProf. Hay, Prof. Chas. H. Peck, Prof. W. J. Farlow, and others,\r\nincluding the various mushroom clubs, to disseminate a more general\r\nknowledge on this subject.\r\n\r\nLate investigations show that nearly all the species common to the\r\ncountries of Continental Europe, and of Great Britain, are found in\r\ndifferent localities in the United States, and a number of species have\r\nbeen found which have not been described in European works.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of many species of the mushroom family is\r\nvery wide. We have had specimens of the _Morel_, for instance, sent to\r\nus from California and Washington, on the Pacific coast, and as far\r\nnorth as Maine, on the Atlantic, as well as from the southern and the\r\nmidwestern States, and the same is true of other species. The season of\r\ntheir appearance varies somewhat according to the latitude and altitude\r\nof place of growth. Mushrooms are rarely seen after the first heavy\r\nfrosts, although an exception is noted in this latitude in the species\r\nHypholoma sublatertium, which has been found growing under the snow, at\r\nthe roots of trees in sheltered woods. Frozen mushrooms of this and\r\nclosely allied species have revived when thawed, and proved quite\r\npalatable when cooked.\r\n\r\nAt the present time only two species, Agaricus campester and Agaricus\r\narvensis, are cultivated in America. Some attempts have been made by an\r\namateur mushroom club in Ohio to cultivate the Morel, but the results\r\nhave not, so far, been reported. In the meantime, however, it is well to\r\nutilize the wild mushrooms as fast as the collector can satisfactorily\r\nidentify them. The woods of all moist regions of this country abound\r\nwith edible varieties. Prof. Curtis, of North Carolina, gives a list of\r\nover one hundred edible species found in that State alone, and nearly\r\nall of these occur in our Northern States as well. It is not contended\r\nthat this list includes all the species which may be eaten, nor have all\r\nof these equal value from a gastronomic point of view. Some are insipid\r\nas to flavor, and others are too tough or too slimy to please the\r\npopular taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUTIONARY SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore collecting for the table mushrooms found growing in the woods or\r\nfields, it would be well for inexperienced persons to consult carefully\r\nsome work on the subject in which the characteristics of edible and\r\npoisonous varieties are described and illustrated.\r\n\r\nConsidering that an opinion seems to prevail that the discoloration of\r\nthe silver spoon or small white onions when brought into contact with\r\nmushrooms during the culinary process is an infallible test of the\r\npoisonous species, I quote from a French author on mushrooms the\r\nfollowing in relation to this supposed test:\r\n\r\n    * * * We may not dispute the fact that a silver spoon or article of\r\n    brass, or onions, may not become discolored on contact with the\r\n    poisonous principle, but this discoloration is not reliable as a\r\n    test for deciding the good or bad quality of mushrooms. In fact, we\r\n    know that in the decomposition of albuminoids sulphureted hydrogen\r\n    is liberated which of itself discolors silver, brass, and onions.\r\n\r\nI have deemed it advisable to publish this as one of the best means of\r\nanswering those correspondents who have made inquiries as to the\r\nreliability of this test.\r\n\r\nIt is by some supposed that high colors and viscidity are indications of\r\nnon-edible species, but there are numerous exceptions here. _Russula\r\nalutacea_--the pileus of which is often a purplish red--_Amanita\r\nCaesarea_, and other species of brilliant coloring are known to be\r\nedible. As to viscidity, two very viscid species, when young, are among\r\nthe highly prized esculents by those who know them, viz., _Fistulina\r\nhepatica_, or the ox tongue, and _Hygrophorus eburneus_, the ivory\r\nmushroom.\r\n\r\nThe method of deciding the character of mushrooms by their odor and\r\nflavor is not to be relied upon. Edible mushrooms are usually\r\ncharacterized by a pleasant flavor and odor; non-edible varieties have\r\nsometimes an unpleasant odor, and produce a biting, burning sensation on\r\nthe tongue and throat, even in very small quantities, but several of the\r\n_Amanitas_ have only a slight odor and taste, and certain species of\r\nmushrooms, acrid otherwise, become edible when cooked.\r\n\r\nIn fact there is no general rule by which the edible species can be\r\ndistinguished from the unwholesome or poisonous ones. The safest as well\r\nas the most sensible plan, therefore, is to apply the same rule as that\r\nwhich we adopt in the case of the esculents among the flowering plants,\r\nviz., to learn to know the characteristics of each individual species so\r\nas to distinguish it from all others.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the mushrooms which have been designated as poisonous, it\r\nshould be remembered that the term \"poisonous\" is used relatively. While\r\nsome are only slightly poisonous, producing severe gastric irritation\r\nand nervous derangement, but without fatal results, others, if eaten in\r\neven very small quantity, may cause death. Happily, however, the most\r\ndangerous species are not numerous as compared with the number that are\r\nedible, and with careful attention on the part of the collector they may\r\nbe avoided.\r\n\r\nSince the Amanita group is made responsible by competent authority for\r\nmost of the recorded cases of fatal poisoning, we would recommend the\r\namateur mycophagist to give special study to this group in order to\r\nlearn to separate the species authentically recorded as edible from the\r\npoisonous ones.\r\n\r\nSome writers, as a measure of precaution, counsel the rejection of all\r\nspecies of Amanita. But this is, of course, a matter for individual\r\npreference. There would seem to be no good reason why the observant\r\nstudent should not learn to discriminate between the edible and the\r\npoisonous species of the Amanita as of any other group, and they should\r\nnot be eaten until this discriminating knowledge is acquired.\r\n\r\nSaccardo describes fifteen edible species of this group of mushrooms. We\r\nhave tested three of this number, which, on account of their abundance\r\nin our locality and their good flavor, we would be loth to discard,\r\nviz., A. rubescens, A. Caesarea, and A. strobiliformis.\r\n\r\nA type of the Amanita group, which is named first in the genera of the\r\norder Agaricini, is shown in Fig. 1, Plate B.\r\n\r\nBy reference to this figure some of the special characteristics of the\r\ngroup can be observed. There are mushrooms in other genera which show a\r\nvolva or sheath at the base of the stem, and which contain edible\r\nspecies, but in these the stem is ringless. The Volvariae, for instance,\r\nshow a conspicuous volva, a stem that is ringless, and pinkish spores.\r\nThe Amanitopsis vaginata carries a volva, but no ring. The spores are\r\nwhite, as in the Amanita.\r\n\r\nIn gathering mushrooms either for the table or for the herbarium, care\r\nshould be taken not to leave any portion of the plant in the ground, so\r\nthat no feature shall be lost that will aid in characterizing the\r\nspecies. In the careless pulling up of the plant the volva in the\r\nvolvate species is often left behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     AGARICINI. Fries.\r\n\r\n     LEUCOSPORI (SPORES WHITE, OR YELLOWISH).\r\n\r\n_Genus Russula_ Fr. The _Russulae_ bear some resemblance to the\r\n_Lactars_, their nearest allies, but are at once distinguished from them\r\nby their want of milk.\r\n\r\nThey are very abundant in the forests and open woods. The genus is cited\r\nby some authors as the most natural of the agarics, but, as many of the\r\nspecies very closely resemble each other, it requires careful analysis\r\nto determine them. The plants of this genus are not volvate, and have\r\nneither veil nor ring. The hymenophore is not separate from the trama of\r\nthe gills. Although some are pure white, the caps are usually brilliant\r\nin coloring, but the color is very susceptible to atmospheric changes,\r\nand after heavy rains the bright hues fade, sometimes only leaving a\r\nslight trace of the original coloring in the central depression of the\r\ncap.\r\n\r\nThe cap in youth is somewhat hemispherical, afterwards expanding,\r\nbecoming slightly depressed in the centre, somewhat brittle in texture;\r\ngills rigid, fragile, with acute edge; stem thick, blunt, and polished,\r\nusually short. The spores are globose, or nearly so, slightly rough,\r\nwhite or yellowish, according to the species. In R. virescens the spores\r\nare white, while in R. alutacea the spores are an ochraceous yellow in\r\ntint.\r\n\r\nA number of the species are of pleasant flavor, others peppery or acrid.\r\nOut of seventy-two described by Cooke, twenty-four are recorded as\r\nacrid. With some of these the acridity is said to disappear in cooking,\r\nand a few mycophagists claim to have eaten all varieties with impunity.\r\nWe have recorded, however, some well authenticated cases of serious\r\ngastric disturbance, accompanied by acute inflammation of the mucous\r\nmembrane, caused by the more acrid of these, notably _R. emetica_ and\r\n_R. foetens_, and in view of this fact it would seem a wise precaution\r\nfor the _amateur_ collector to discard or at least to use very sparingly\r\nall those which have an acrid or peppery taste, until well assured as to\r\ntheir wholesomeness.\r\n\r\nThe _genus Russula_ has been divided into the following tribes or\r\ngroups:--Compactae, Furcatae, Rigidae, Heterophylla, and Fragiles. The\r\nspecies _Russula (Rigidae) virescens_, illustrated in Plate I, belongs\r\nto the tribe Rigidae. In the plants of this group, the cap is absolutely\r\ndry and rigid, destitute of a viscid pellicle; the cuticle commonly\r\nbreaking up into flocci or granules; the flesh thick, compact, and firm,\r\nvanishing near the margin, which is never involute, and shows no\r\nstriations. The gills are irregular in length, some few reaching half\r\nway to the stem, the others divided, dilated, and extending into a broad\r\nrounded end, stem solid.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate I.\r\n     RUSSULA VIRESCENS FR.

The margin is usually even, but specimens occur which show\r\nstriations. The color varies from a light green to a grayish or moldy\r\ngreen, sometimes tinged with yellow; gills white, free from the stem or\r\nnearly so, unequal, rather crowded; stem white, stout, solid, smooth, at\r\nfirst hard, then spongy; spores white, nearly globose.\r\n\r\nOne writer speaks of the \"warts\" of the cap, but the term warts, used in\r\nthis connection, refers merely to the patches resulting from the\r\nsplitting or breaking up of the epidermis of the cap, and not to such\r\nexcrescences called warts, as are commonly observed on the cap of\r\nAmanita muscaria, for instance, which are remnants of the volva.\r\n\r\nThe _R. virescens_ is not as common as some others of the Russulae, in\r\nsome localities, and hitherto seems to have attracted but little\r\nattention as an edible species in this country, although highly esteemed\r\nin Europe. It has been found growing in thin woods in Maryland and in\r\nVirginia from June to November, and we have had reports of its growth\r\nfrom New York and Massachusetts. The peasants in Italy are in the habit\r\nof toasting these mushrooms over wood embers, eating them afterwards\r\nwith a little salt. Vittadini, Roques, and Cordier speak highly of its\r\nesculent qualities and good flavor. We have eaten quantities of the\r\nvirescens gathered in Washington, D. C., and its suburbs, and found it\r\njuicy and of good flavor when cooked.\r\n\r\n     EXPLANATION OF PLATE I.\r\n\r\nPlate I exhibits four views of this mushroom (_R. virescens_) drawn and\r\ncolored from nature. Fig. 1, the immature plant; Fig. 2, advanced stage\r\nof growth, cap expanded or plane; Fig. 3, section showing the unequal\r\nlength of the gills and manner of their attachment to the stem; Fig. 4,\r\nsurface view of the cap showing the epidermis split in characteristic\r\nirregular patches; Fig. 5, spores, white.\r\n\r\n     AGARICINI.\r\n\r\n     COPRINARII (SPORES BLACK OR NEARLY SO).\r\n\r\nGenus _Coprinus_ Fries. Hymenophore distinct from the stem. Gills\r\nmembranaceous, at first coherent from the pressure, then dissolving into\r\na black fluid. Trama obsolete. Spores, oval, even, black. M. C. Cooke.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this genus have been divided into two tribes, viz.,\r\n_Pelliculosi_ and _Veliformis_. In the _Pelliculosi_ the gills of the\r\nmushrooms are covered with a fleshy or membranaceous cuticle, hence the\r\ncap is not furrowed along the lines of the gills, but is torn and\r\nrevolute. In this tribe are included the _Comati_, _Atramentarii_,\r\n_Picacei_, _Tomentosi_, _Micacio_ and _Glabrati_. In the tribe\r\n_Veliformis_ the plants are generally very small, and the cap much\r\nthinner than in those of the _Pelliculosi_, soon showing distinct\r\nfurrows along the back of the gills, which quickly melt into very thin\r\nlines. The stem is thin and fistulose.\r\n\r\nCordier states that all the species of _Coprinus_ are edible when young\r\nand fresh. This is probably true, but most of them have so little\r\nsubstance and are so ephemeral as to be of small value for food\r\npurposes. _C. comatus_, _C. atramentarius_, _C. micaceus_, and _C.\r\novatus_ have the preference with most mycophagists, but even these soon\r\nmelt, and should be gathered promptly and cooked immediately to be of\r\nuse for the table.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate II.\r\n     COPRINUS COMATUS FR.

PHILA.]\r\n\r\n     PLATE II.\r\n\r\n     =Coprinus comatus= Fries. _Maned or Shaggy Coprinus_.\r\n\r\n     EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCap at first oblong or cylindrical, then campanulate, the cuticle\r\nbreaking into shaggy fibrous scales, color whitish, the scales generally\r\nyellow or yellowish, margin revolute and lacerated, soon becoming black.\r\nGills linear, free, and close together, at first white, then pink or\r\npurplish, turning to black. Stem hollow or slightly stuffed, nearly\r\nequal, somewhat fibrillose, with bulb solid; the ring movable or very\r\nslightly adherent, generally disappearing as the plant matures. Spores\r\noval, black, .0005 to .0007 in. long.\r\n\r\nThis species is found in abundance in different parts of the United\r\nStates, generally in rich soil, in pastures, by roadsides, in dumping\r\nlots, etc. Of late years quantities have been gathered in the lawn\r\nsurrounding the Capitol grounds, and in the parks of the District of\r\nColumbia, as well as in the debris of the wooden block pavements used\r\nfor surface soiling gardens in vicinity of the capital. They have been\r\noffered for sale in open market as low as 25 cents per pound.\r\n\r\nA correspondent from Rochester, New York, states that in a patch of his\r\ngrounds which had been quarried out and filled with street sweepings the\r\nCoprinus comatus appeared in such quantities as to make it impossible to\r\nwalk over the space without stepping upon them, and that he was able to\r\ngather from this small space from one to two bushels at a time in the\r\nspring and the fall. In flavor the C. comatus resembles the cultivated\r\nmushroom, though perhaps more delicate.\r\n\r\nThe _Coprinus ovatus_, \"_Oval Coprinus_,\" a closely allied species, is\r\nsimilar to the comatus, but smaller, more ovate in shape and delicate in\r\nflavor, less deliquescent; stem usually 3/4 of an inch long. The\r\n_Coprinus atramentarius_ has a mouse-gray or brownish cap with irregular\r\nmargin, slightly striated. It is not shaggy, but is spotted with minute,\r\ninnate punctate scales. The stem is hollow, somewhat ringed when young.\r\nSpores elliptical, black.\r\n\r\n_Coprinus micaceus_ is a very common species, and is found generally in\r\nclusters on old tree stumps or on decaying wood. The cap is thin and of\r\na reddish buff or ochraceous tint, often showing a sprinkling of\r\nglistening micaceous scales or granules; gills crowded, whitish. It is\r\nat first ovate or bell-shaped, then expanding; striated. The stem is\r\nwhite, slender, and hollow, not ringed. The spores in this species are a\r\nvery dark brown, which is unusual in the genus _Coprinus_.\r\n\r\nIt is generally found in decaying wood or old tree-stumps, growing in\r\ndense clusters.\r\n\r\nProf. Peck says: \"European writers do not record the '_Glistening\r\ncoprinus_' among the edible species, perhaps because of its small size.\r\nBut it compensates for its lack of size by its frequency and abundance.\r\nIn tenderness and delicacy it does not appear to be at all inferior to\r\nthe '_Shaggy coprinus_.'\"\r\n\r\n     EXPLANATION OF PLATE II.\r\n\r\n     =Coprinus comatus= Fr. _The Shaggy Maned Mushroom_.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.

Cooke.\r\n\r\nA characteristic of the species of this genus is their tendency to\r\nwither with drought and revive with moisture. This biological\r\ncharacteristic is of great importance in determining the true Marasmii.\r\nThe plants are usually small and of little substance.\r\n\r\nCooke divides the Marasmii into three tribes, and these again into\r\nseveral subdivisions. In the division Scortei of this genus are classed\r\nthree species which are described in the works of most of the\r\nContinental writers; the Marasmius oreades, which has recognized value\r\nas an esculent, Marasmius urens and Marasmius peronatus, which have the\r\nreputation of being acrid and unwholesome.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate III.\r\n     MARASMIUS OREADES FR.

Spores white.\r\n\r\nThis species is usually found in open grassy places, sometimes in rings,\r\nor in parts of rings, often in clusters, and writers generally agree as\r\nto its agreeable taste and odor. When properly cooked its toughness\r\ndisappears.\r\n\r\nProf. Peck describes two mushrooms which are somewhat similar in\r\nappearance to the \"_Fairy Ring_,\" and which might be taken for it by\r\ncareless observers, viz., the Naucoria semi-orbicularis, sometimes\r\ngrowing in company with it, and the _Collybia dryophila_, a wood variety\r\nwhich is sometimes found in open places.\r\n\r\nThe first of these may be distinguished from the _oreades_, by the rusty\r\nbrown color of the gills, its smooth stem and rusty colored spores. In\r\nthe second the gills are much narrower and the stem is very smooth and\r\nhollow.\r\n\r\nThe _Marasmius urens_ as described by European authors has a pale buff\r\ncap, not umbonate but flat, and at length depressed in the centre, from\r\none to two inches across. The gills are unequal, free, very crowded;\r\ncream color, becoming brownish. The stem is solid and fibrous, densely\r\ncovered with white down at the base. It is very acrid to the taste. In\r\nhabit of growth it is subcaespitose; sometimes found growing in company\r\nwith the M. oreades.\r\n\r\nProf. Peck says of _M. urens_ that he has not yet seen an American\r\nspecimen which he could refer to that species with satisfaction. Our\r\nexperience, so far, is the same as that of Prof. Peck.\r\n\r\n_Marasmius peronatus_ has a reddish buff cap, with crowded thin gills,\r\ncreamy, turning to reddish brown; the stem solid and fibrous, with\r\nyellowish filaments at the base. It is acrid in taste and is usually\r\nfound among fallen leaves in woods.\r\n\r\n     EXPLANATION OF PLATE III.\r\n\r\nIn Plate III, Fig. 1 represents an immature plant; Fig. 2, cap expanding\r\nwith growth; Fig. 3, cap further expanded and slightly umbonate; Fig. 4,\r\nmature specimen, cap plane or fully expanded, margin irregular and\r\nsmooth, stem equal, smooth and ringless; Fig. 5, section showing gills\r\nbroad, free, ventricose, unequal, and flesh white; Fig. 6, spores\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVING AND COOKING MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nIn Europe several species of mushrooms are preserved by boiling and\r\nafterwards placing them in earthern jars or tubs filled with water,\r\nwhich is renewed from time to time. This simple and economical method of\r\nkeeping mushrooms affords the people considerable provision. With regard\r\nto the preparation of fresh mushrooms for table use, Dr. Roques, an\r\neminent writer on fungi, gives the following excellent suggestions:\r\n\"After selecting good mushrooms, remove the skin or epidermis, cutting\r\naway the gills, and in some cases the stem, which is usually of not so\r\nfine a texture.\r\n\r\n\"It is important to collect for use only young and well-preserved\r\nspecimens, because a mushroom of excellent quality may, nevertheless,\r\nwhen overmature or near its decline, become dangerous for food. It then\r\nacts as does every other food substance which incipient decomposition\r\nhas rendered acrid, irritating and indigestible. It is, moreover, rarely\r\nthe case that mushrooms in their decline are not changed by the presence\r\nof larvae.\"\r\n\r\nIn Geneva a very lucrative trade is carried on in the exportation of the\r\n\"_Edible Boletus_,\" which is preserved for use in various ways, the\r\nsimplest of which consists in cutting the caps in slices and stringing\r\nthem, after which they are placed on hurdles in the shade to dry. They\r\nmay also be dried in a stove or oven, but the former method is\r\npreferable, as the mushroom then retains more of its flavor or perfume.\r\nWhen the slices are perfectly dried they are put into sacks and\r\nsuspended in a dry, airy place. Sometimes before the mushrooms are\r\nsliced they are plunged into boiling water for an instant, which\r\ntreatment is said to preserve them from the ravages of insects. Several\r\nkinds of mushrooms are preserved in the following manner: After they\r\nhave been properly washed and cleansed, they are boiled in salted water\r\nand afterwards wiped dry. They are then placed in layers, in jars,\r\nsprinkled with salt and pepper, and covered with pure olive oil or\r\nvinegar. _Lactarius deliciosus_, _Cantharellus cibarius_, _Morchellas_,\r\n_Clavarias_, etc., are thus preserved. Before using the dried mushrooms\r\nthey are soaked in tepid water for some time and afterwards prepared as\r\nif fresh, with the usual seasoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEIPTS.\r\n\r\n_Broiled procerus._--Remove the scales and stalks from the agarics, and\r\nbroil lightly on both sides over a clear fire for a few minutes; arrange\r\nthem on a dish over freshly made, well-buttered toast; sprinkle with\r\npepper and salt and put a small piece of butter on each; set before a\r\nbrisk fire to melt the butter, and serve quickly. Bacon toasted over\r\nmushrooms improves the flavor and saves the butter.\r\n\r\n_Agarics delicately stewed._--Remove the stalks and scales from the\r\nyoung half-grown agarics, and throw each one as you do so into a basin\r\nof fresh water slightly acidulated with the juice of a lemon or a little\r\ngood vinegar. When all are prepared, remove them from the water and put\r\nthem in a stewpan with a very small piece of fresh butter. Sprinkle with\r\npepper and salt and add a little lemon juice; cover up closely and stew\r\nfor half an hour; then add a spoonful of flour with sufficient cream or\r\ncream and milk, till the whole has the thickness of cream. Season to\r\ntaste, and stew again until the agarics are perfectly tender. Remove all\r\nthe butter from the surface and serve in a hot dish garnished with\r\nslices of lemon. A little mace or nutmeg or catsup may be added, but\r\nsome think that spice spoils the flavor.\r\n\r\n_Cottager's procerus pie._--Cut fresh agarics in small pieces; pepper,\r\nsalt, and place them on small shreds of bacon, in the bottom of a pie\r\ndish; then put in a layer of mashed potatoes, and so fill the dish,\r\nlayer by layer, with a cover of mashed potatoes for the crust. Bake well\r\nfor half an hour and brown before a quick fire.\r\n\r\n_A la provencale._--Steep for two hours in some salt, pepper, and a\r\nlittle garlic; then toss them into a small stewpan over a brisk fire\r\nwith parsley chopped and a little lemon juice.\r\n\r\n_Agaric catsup._--Place the agarics of as large a size as you can\r\nprocure, layer by layer, in a deep pan, sprinkling each layer as it is\r\nput in with a little salt. Then next day stir them several times well so\r\nas to mash and extract their juice. On the third day strain off the\r\nliquor, measure and boil for ten minutes, and then to every pint of\r\nliquor add half an ounce of black pepper, a quarter of an ounce of\r\nbruised ginger root, a blade of mace, a clove or two, and a teaspoonful\r\nof mustard seed. Boil again for half an hour; put in two or three bay\r\nleaves and set aside until quite cold. Pass through a strainer and\r\nbottle; cork well and dip salt on the gills. Lay them top downwards on a\r\ngridiron over a moderate fire for five or six minutes at the most.\r\n\r\n_To stew mushrooms._--Trim and rub clean half a pint of large button\r\nmushrooms. Put into a stewpan 2 ounces of butter; shake it over a fire\r\nuntil thoroughly melted; put in the mushrooms, a teaspoonful of salt,\r\nhalf as much pepper, and a blade of mace pounded; stew until the\r\nmushrooms are tender, then serve on a hot dish. This is usually a\r\nbreakfast dish.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms a la creme._--Trim and rub half a pint of button mushrooms;\r\ndissolve in a stewpan 2 ounces of butter rolled in flour; put in the\r\nmushrooms, a bunch of parsley, a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful\r\neach of white pepper and of powdered sugar; shake the pan for ten\r\nminutes; then beat up the yolks of two eggs with two tablespoonfuls of\r\ncream, and add by degrees to the mushrooms; in two or three minutes you\r\ncan serve them in sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms on toast._--Put a pint of mushrooms into a stewpan with two\r\nounces of butter rolled in flour; add a teaspoonful of salt, half a\r\nteaspoonful of white pepper, a blade of powdered mace, and a half a\r\nteaspoonful of grated lemon; stew until the butter is all absorbed; then\r\nserve on toast as soon as the mushrooms are tender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX B.\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN DESCRIBING MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abortive_, imperfectly developed.\r\n\r\n_Acaulescent_, _acaulous_, having a very short stem or none.\r\n\r\n_Acetabuliform_, cup-shaped.\r\n\r\n_Acicular_, needle-shaped.\r\n\r\n_Aculeate_, slender pointed.\r\n\r\n_Acuminate_, terminating in a point.\r\n\r\n_Acute_, sharp pointed.\r\n\r\n_Adnate_, gills firmly attached to the stem.\r\n\r\n_Adnexed_, gills just reaching the stem.\r\n\r\n_Adpressed_, pressed in close contact, as applied to gills.\r\n\r\n_Aeruginous_, verdigris-green.\r\n\r\n_Agglutinated_, glued to the surface.\r\n\r\n_Aggregated_, collected together.\r\n\r\n_Alveolate_, socketed or honeycombed.\r\n\r\n_Amphigenous_, when the hymenium is not restricted to a particular\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n_Analogy_, superficial or general resemblance without structural\r\nagreement.\r\n\r\n_Anastomosing_, branching, joining of one vein with another.\r\n\r\n_Annular_, ring-shaped.\r\n\r\n_Annulate_, having a ring.\r\n\r\n_Annulus_, ring round the stem of agarics.\r\n\r\n_Apex_, in mushrooms the extremity of the stem nearest the gill.\r\n\r\n_Apical_, close to the apex.\r\n\r\n_Apiculate_, terminating in a small point.\r\n\r\n_Appendiculate_, hanging in small fragments.\r\n\r\n_Approximate_, of gills which approach the stem but do not reach it.\r\n\r\n_Arachnoid_, cobweb-like.\r\n\r\n_Arboreal_, _arboricle_, tree-inhabiting.\r\n\r\n_Arcuate_, bow-shaped.\r\n\r\n_Areolate_, divided into little areas or patches.\r\n\r\n_Argillaceous_, clayey, like clay.\r\n\r\n_Ascending_, directed upward.\r\n\r\n_Asci_, _ascidia_, spore-cases of certain mushrooms.\r\n\r\n_Attenuated_, tapering gradually to a point upward or downward.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Band_, a broad bar of color.\r\n\r\n_Banded_, marked with bands.\r\n\r\n_Barbed_, furnished with fibrils or hairs.\r\n\r\n_Basidia_, cellular processes of certain mushroom-bearing spores.\r\n\r\n_Bibliography_, condensed history of the literature of a subject.\r\n\r\n_Bifurcated_, divided into two, as in the gills of certain agarics.\r\n\r\n_Booted_, applied to the stem of a mushroom when inclosed in a sheath or\r\nvolva.\r\n\r\n_Boss_, a knob or short rounded protuberance.\r\n\r\n_Bossed_, _bullate_, furnished with a boss or knob.\r\n\r\n_Branched_, dividing from the sides;

Taylor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASCOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFruit, consisting of sporidia, mostly definite, contained in asci,\r\nspringing from a naked or enclosed stratum of fructifying cells, and\r\nforming a hymenium.--Cooke and Berkeley.\r\n\r\nProf. J. de Seyne states that the three elements which form the hymenium\r\nin the families Hymenomycetes and Gasteromycetes are (1) the normal\r\nbasidium, that is, the fruitful club-shaped cell which supports the\r\nnaked spores, (2) the cystidium or sterile cell, an aborted or atrophied\r\nbasidium, and (3) the paraphyses, hypertrophied basidium, the one organ,\r\nthe basidium, being the basis of it all, according as it experiences an\r\narrest of development, as it grows and fructifies, or as it becomes\r\nhypertrophied.\r\n\r\nIn the family Ascomycetes a minute ascus or spore case envelops the\r\nsporidia, and takes the place of the basidium, and the hymenium consists\r\nof (1) the asci containing the sporidia, (2) the paraphyses, and (3) a\r\ncolorless or yellowish mucilage which envelops the paraphyses and asci.\r\nThe asci are present in all species. In some species, however, the\r\nparaphyses are rare, and the mucilaginous substance is entirely wanting.\r\nThe asci differ in shape and size, according to the species. The\r\nparaphyses, when present, are at first very short, but they rapidly\r\nelongate, and are wholly developed before the appearance of the asci.\r\nThey are linear, simple or branched according to the species of plant,\r\nusually containing oily granules. There is some difference of opinion\r\namong mycologists as to the special functions of the paraphyses, some\r\nconsidering them as abortive asci, and others, like Boudier, as\r\nexcitatory organs for the dehiscence of the asci, by which the spores\r\nare liberated.\r\n\r\nThe family Ascomycetes is rich in genera and species.\r\n\r\nIt consists largely of microscopic fungi, however, and the only group\r\nwhich will be considered here is that which includes plants of the\r\nmushroom family which are edible and indigenous to this country, viz.,\r\nthe sub-family Discomycetes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name Discomycetes, \"disk-like fungi,\" does not give an accurate idea\r\nof the distinguishing characteristics of this sub-family, the discoid\r\nform only belonging to the plants of one of its groups. In the\r\nDiscomyceteae the hymenium is superior, that is, disposed upon the upper\r\nor exterior surface of the mushroom cap. The sporidia are produced in\r\nmembraneous asci, usually four or eight, or some multiple of that\r\nnumber, in each ascus; Cooke says \"rarely four, most commonly eight.\"\r\nThe sporidia are usually hyaline, transparent; colored sporidia are\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nThe asci are so minute as to be imperceptible to the naked eye; but if a\r\nsmall portion of the upper surface of the cap is removed with a pen\r\nknife and placed under a microscope having a magnifying power of from\r\n400 to 800 diameters, the asci, or spore sacks, can be separated and\r\ntheir structure studied.\r\n\r\nOf the genera included in the Discomycetes the genus Peziza comprises by\r\nfar the largest number of described species. The plants in this genus\r\nare generally small, thin, and tough. A few of them have been recorded\r\nas edible by European authors, but not specially commended; one form,\r\nPeziza _cochleata_, has been spoken of by Berkeley as being gathered in\r\nbasketfuls in one county in England, where it is used as a substitute,\r\nthough a very indifferent one, for the Morel.\r\n\r\nVittadini says the Verpa _digitaliformis_ Persoon, a small\r\nbrownish-colored mushroom, is sold in Italian markets for soups, but\r\nthat, \"although sold in the markets, it is only to be recommended when\r\nno other fungus offers, which is sometimes the case in the spring.\" P.\r\n_aurantia_ Vahl., a small Peziza growing in clusters in the grass, is\r\nreported as edible by a member of the Boston Mycological Club, who\r\nspeaks well of it.\r\n\r\nThe genera Morchella, Gyromitra, Helvella, and Mitrula contain, however,\r\nwhat may be considered the most desirable edible species. Types of these\r\nfour groups are represented in Figs. 1, 3, 5, 7, and 10, Plate C.\r\n\r\nThe plants of these genera have a stem and cap. The cap, however,\r\ndiffers very much from that of the ordinary mushroom. In the genus\r\nMorchella the cap is deeply pitted and ridged so that it presents a\r\nhoneycombed appearance. In Gyromitra the cap is convolutely lobed but\r\nnot pitted. In Helvella the cap is very irregular and reflexed, and in\r\nMitrula the cap is ovate or club shaped and smooth. In all four of these\r\ngenera the hymenium is superior, _i. e._, it is on the upper and outer\r\nsurface of the cap, the interior surface being barren.\r\n\r\nIn Plates C and D are figured 9 types of edible fungi included in the\r\nfamily Ascomycetes, sub-family Discomycetes.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate C.\r\n     ASCOMYCETES\r\n     SUB-FAMILY DISCOMYCETES\r\n     TYPES OF FOUR OF THE LEADING GENERA OF DISCOMYCETES,\r\n     IN WHICH OCCUR EDIBLE SPECIES\r\n     T.

Receptacle pileate or clavate, impervious in the\r\ncentre, stipitate, covered with hymenium, which is deeply folded and\r\npitted.--Cooke.\r\n\r\nIn this genus the species have a general resemblance to each other in\r\nsize, color, form, texture, and flavor. The cap is usually a dull\r\nyellow, sometimes slightly olive-tinted, darkening with age to a\r\nbrownish leather tinge. The stems are stout and hollow, white or\r\nwhitish. This genus has a very wide geographical distribution, but the\r\nspecies are not numerous. Cooke describes twenty-four, some of them\r\nfound in India, Java, Great Britain, Central and Northern Europe,\r\nAustralia, and North America. Peck describes six species found in New\r\nYork State. The lines of demarcation between species are not very\r\ndecided; but as none of the species are known to be poisonous, it may\r\nbe considered a safe genus to experiment with.\r\n\r\nIn the Morchella esculenta the cap is ovate, in one variety rotund, the\r\nmargin attaching itself to the stem; ribs firm and anastomosing, forming\r\ndeep hollows or pits; color yellowish tan, olivaceous; spores hyaline,\r\ncolorless; asci very long. The Morel, though rare in some localities, is\r\nfound in large quantities in some of the midwestern States, sometimes in\r\nthe woods along the borders of streams, often in peach orchards, at the\r\nroots of decaying trees.\r\n\r\nI am informed by correspondents who have collected and eaten them that\r\nthe Morels can be gathered in abundance in the springtime along the\r\nbanks of the Missouri and tributary streams. A lieutenant in the United\r\nStates Army informs me that he found fine specimens of this species in\r\nthe mountains of California, five or six thousand feet above sea-level.\r\nA correspondent, Mr. H. W. Henshaw, writes that he has made many\r\nexcellent meals of them, finding them on the banks of Chico Creek,\r\nSacramento Valley, California, on Gen. Bidwell's ranch, in April. A\r\ncorrespondent in Minnesota writes: \"The Morel grows abundantly in some\r\nplaces here, but so prejudiced are many of the natives against\r\n'toad-stools' that I had to eat the Morel alone for a whole season\r\nbefore I could induce any one else to taste it.\" Mr. Hollis Webster, of\r\nthe Boston Mycological Club, reports the Morchella _conica_ as appearing\r\nin abundance in eastern Massachusetts in May of this year. A\r\ncorrespondent in West Virginia reports that quantities of a large-sized\r\nMorel are found in the mountain regions there.\r\n\r\nI have reports also of the appearance of the Morel in Western New York,\r\nand on the coast of Maine and of Oregon. A miner writes to me from\r\nMontana that he and several other miners, having lost their way in the\r\nmountains of that State during the spring of the year, subsisted\r\nentirely for five days on Morels which they collected.\r\n\r\nThe specimen represented in Plate C, Fig. 1, is figured from a Morchella\r\n_esculenta_ which grew in the vicinity of Falls Church, Va., less than\r\nten miles from the District of Columbia. The reports which I have\r\nreceived from correspondents in twenty States show that the Morel is not\r\nso rare in this country as was formerly supposed. The advantages which\r\nthis mushroom possesses over some others are (1) the readiness with\r\nwhich it can be distinguished, (2) its keeping qualities, and (3) its\r\nagreeable taste. It is easily dried, and in that condition can be kept a\r\nlong time without losing its flavor. Though it has not the rich flavor\r\nof the common field mushroom, it is very palatable when cooked, and when\r\ndried it is often used in soups. It is very generally esteemed as an\r\nesculent among mycophagists.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 represents the sporidia enclosed in the ascus, or spore sack,\r\nwith accompanying paraphyses.\r\n\r\n     FIG. 3. =Gyromitra= _esculenta_ Fries. \"_Esculent Gyromitra_.\"\r\n\r\n_Genus Gyromitra_ Fries. This genus contains very few species, but all\r\nare considered edible, though differing somewhat in flavor and\r\ndigestibility. Five or six species are figured by Cooke. Peck speaks of\r\nseveral species found in New York. One of these, G. curtipes Fries, is\r\nalso figured by Cooke as found in North Carolina. This species Cooke\r\nregards as equal in flavor to G. esculenta. G. esculenta has a rounded,\r\ninflated cap, irregularly lobed and hollow, smooth and brittle in\r\ntexture, reddish brown. It falls over the stem in heavy convolutions,\r\ntouching it at various points. The stem is stout, stuffed, at length\r\nhollow, whitish or cinereous; spores elliptical with two nuclei,\r\nyellowish, translucent. The plant is usually from two to four inches in\r\nheight, but larger specimens are found.\r\n\r\nFig. 4 represents the spore sack with enclosed sporidia.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles L. Fox, of Portland, Maine, records the Gyromitra\r\n_esculenta_, of which he sent me a very good specimen last spring, as\r\nquite abundant during May in the open woods near the city named.\r\nSpeaking of this species, he says: \"From the point of view of their\r\nedibility, we have classed them under two heads--the light and the dark\r\nvarieties. These differ in the locality in which they are found, in\r\ntheir color and in the convolutions of their surface. Both grow large.\r\n\r\n\"The _Light Gyromitra_ is the more easily digested of the two. Its\r\nheight varies from three to five inches, cap three to five inches in\r\ndiameter. Its cap is inflated, very irregular, and twisted in large\r\nconvolutions. These convolutions are almost smooth on the surface,\r\nsometimes showing small depressions; margin generally attached to the\r\nstem in parts. It is a transparent yellow in color. This variety does\r\nnot grow dark brown with age. Stem white or very light buff, smooth, and\r\nhollow. It grows best on slopes facing the south, in scant woods of\r\nbirch, maple, and pine. We have found no specimens in open places or on\r\nthe borders of woods.\r\n\r\n\"The _Dark Gyromitra_ is more common than the light variety. Its color\r\nis generally of dark lake brown, even in the young plant, though it is\r\nsometimes of a light warm yellow, which grows darker with age. Stem\r\nflesh-colored or pallid, but not white, nor so light as in the first\r\nvariety. Its cap is similar in its large convolutions to that of the\r\nlight variety, but it is covered with many intricate vermiform ridges,\r\nsometimes in high relief or even strongly undercut. Grows in mossy\r\nplaces, in light sandy soil, on borders of pine woods. Its flesh is\r\nbrittle, but not so tender as that of the first variety. Both varieties\r\ndry readily. We should advise eating the _Dark Gyromitra_ only in\r\nmoderate amounts, as, if eaten in quantity, or if old specimens are\r\nused, indigestion or nausea is liable to follow. In regard to both\r\nvarieties, I would advise that only young specimens should be eaten at\r\nfirst, as they are more tender and less pronounced in flavor than the\r\nolder plants. We have eaten, however, a considerable quantity of the\r\n_Light Gyromitra_ with no unpleasant results. The flavor of the\r\nGyromitras is quite strong, and some have found it too much so to be\r\nagreeable on the first eating. The general opinion here, however, is\r\nfavorable to the Gyromitra as an excellent addition to the table.\"\r\n\r\nSome German authorities speak well of the flavor of the G. esculenta,\r\nand it is sold in the German markets. Cordier records it as agreeable in\r\ntaste when cooked. Peck says that he has repeatedly eaten it without\r\nexperiencing any evil results, but does not consider its flavor equal to\r\nthat of a first-class mushroom. He advises also that it should be eaten\r\nwith moderation, and that only perfectly fresh specimens should be used,\r\nsickness having resulted from eating freely of specimens that had been\r\nkept twenty-four hours before being cooked.\r\n\r\nI have not been fortunate in securing a sufficient quantity of fresh\r\nspecimens to test its edible qualities personally, but the testimony\r\nreceived from those who have eaten it seems to point to the necessity\r\nfor moderation in eating and care in securing fresh specimens to cook.\r\n\r\n     FIG. 5. =Helvella crispa=. \"_Crisp Helvella_.\"\r\n\r\n_Genus Helvella_ Linn. The plants of this genus are usually small,\r\nthough a few of the species are of good size. They are not plentiful,\r\nbut they are very generally regarded as edible, the flavor bearing a\r\nresemblance to that of the Morel. The cap has a smooth, not polished,\r\nsurface, and is very irregular, revolute, and deflexed, not honeycombed\r\nlike the Morel, nor showing the brain-like convolutions of the\r\nGyromitras. Color brownish pale tan, or whitish. The stem in the larger\r\nspecies is stout, and sometimes deeply furrowed in longitudinal grooves,\r\nusually white or whitish.\r\n\r\nThe species Helvella crispa is white or pallid throughout, cap very\r\nirregular, sometimes deeply concave in the centre, with margin at first\r\nerect, then drooping; again it is undulating, much divided and deflexed;\r\nin fact, so irregular is the shape that scarcely two specimens will show\r\nthe cap the same in outline; stem stout and deeply channelled. Spores\r\nelliptical, transparent. Habitat woods, growing singly or in groups, but\r\nnot caespitose.\r\n\r\nFig. 6, the ascus or spore sack and paraphyses.\r\n\r\n_Genus Mitrula_ Fries. Soft and fleshy, simple capitate, stem distinct,\r\nhymenium surrounding the inflated cap; head ovate, obtuse, inflated.--M.\r\nC. Cooke.\r\n\r\nCooke says of this genus that it is scarcely so well characterized as\r\nmany with which it is associated, and that some of the species are\r\nevidently so closely allied to some of the species of the genus\r\nGeoglossum that it is difficult to draw the line of demarcation between\r\nthem, particularly so with the species Mitrula _pistillaris_ B. from\r\nLouisiana.\r\n\r\nThe plants are very small, and though none are recorded as poisonous,\r\nonly one or two have any value as esculents.\r\n\r\n     FIG. 7. =Mitrula sclerotipes= Boudier.\r\n\r\nThe cap in this species is small, and the stem long and slender. The\r\nspores are transparent, the asci club-shaped. The plants of this species\r\nare always found springing from an oblong sclerotium; hence the name\r\nsclerotipes.\r\n\r\nFig. 8 represents the sporidia enclosed in their asci with paraphyses\r\nand individual spores, the latter magnified 800 diameters.

The latter was first described in 1879, in\r\nPeck's Thirty-Second Report, under the name Geoglossum _irregulare_.\r\nProf. Peck now gives preference to the name assigned to it by Saccardo,\r\nand it is so recorded in Peck's later reports.\r\n\r\nProf. Peck records this species as edible, and recommends it as having\r\ntender flesh and an agreeable flavor. It sometimes grows in profusion in\r\nwet mossy places, in woods, or swampy ground. It is bright yellow in\r\ncolor, clean and attractive. The cap is much longer than the stem, often\r\ndeeply lobed, extremely irregular in outline, and tapers to a short\r\nyellowish or whitish stem. The spores are narrowly elliptical and\r\ntransparent. The specimen illustrated is from a small one figured by\r\nPeck. The plants sometimes reach two inches in height. They are most\r\nabundant in temperate climates.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate D.\r\n     FOUR TYPES OF THE GENUS MORCHELLA.\r\n     T.

Peck says that this\r\nspecies has been described by Persoon under the name Morchella\r\n_hybrida_, and this name is adopted in Saccardo's Sylloge Fungorum, but\r\nmost English writers prefer the first.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.

A characteristic\r\nof this species which distinguishes it from others of the same genus is\r\nfound in the number of its sporidia, spores as seen in the ascus or\r\nspore sack. In the plants of the genus Morchella the spore sacks, with\r\none or two exceptions, contain eight spores.\r\n\r\nIn the species M. _bispora_ the spore sacks contain but two spores and\r\nthese are much larger than the sporidia of those which contain eight.\r\nThis characteristic, however, can only be determined by the aid of the\r\nmicroscope.\r\n\r\nCooke figures a specimen taken from those published by Sorokin in\r\nThumen's Exsiccata, and calls it a variety of Morchella _Bohemica_\r\nKromb. He says that it is not unusual to find M. _Bohemica_ with two or\r\nfour sporidia in some of the asci, mixed with others containing more,\r\nsome specimens being entirely tetrasporous, and some, as the variety\r\n_bispora_, usually containing but two sporidia. Cooke contends that M.\r\nbispora is simply a bisporous form of Morchella _Bohemica_, and calls it\r\nM. _Bohemica_ var. _bispora_. It is not as common as other species.\r\n\r\nFig. 9 represents asci of M. bispora showing the two spores in each\r\nascus.\r\n\r\n     FIG. 4. =Morchella conica.= \"_Conical Morel_.\"\r\n\r\n     EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCap conical or oblong-conical, margin adhering to the stem, the\r\nprominent ridges longitudinal and irregularly bisected with shorter\r\nones; the whole plant hollow throughout; color pale tan or ochraceous\r\nyellow, growing dingy and darker with age; stem white; spores\r\nelliptical.\r\n\r\nThis species is quite plentiful in some localities; the flavor is like\r\nthat of M. _esculenta_.\r\n\r\nFig. 5.

Fries.\r\n\r\n     LEUCOSPORI (SPORES WHITE OR YELLOWISH).\r\n\r\n_Genus Lactarius_ Fries. The plants of this genus have neither veil nor\r\nvolva. They somewhat resemble the _Russulae_, but can be readily\r\ndistinguished from them by the greater fleshiness of the stem and by the\r\nmilky juice which exudes from the flesh. The latter is a characteristic\r\nfeature of the _Lactars_, giving to the group its name.\r\n\r\nThe species were originally arranged by Fries into groups according to\r\nthe color and quality of the milk, and of the naked or pruinose\r\ncharacter of the gills. Prof. Peck, however, considering the latter\r\ncharacter not sufficiently constant or obvious to be satisfactory, in\r\nhis early reports makes the color of the milk alone the basis of the\r\nprimary grouping of the American species.\r\n\r\nSaccardo, in his Sylloge, follows Fries in his classification of the\r\nspecies of the genus Lactarius.\r\n\r\nIn some species the milk is at first bright colored and continues\r\nunchanged; in others it is always white or whitish, and in others again\r\nit is at first white, changing to different hues on exposure to the air,\r\nbecoming pinkish, pale violet, or yellow. In one species (C. indigo)\r\nboth plant and milk are of indigo blue. The taste of the milk varies, as\r\ndoes that of the flesh, according to species. Sometimes it is mild or\r\nvery slightly acrid, and again it resembles Cayenne pepper in its hot,\r\nbiting acridity. It is somewhat viscid or sticky in character, and\r\npermeates to some extent the whole flesh of the mushroom, but is most\r\nprofuse in the gills, where in fresh young specimens it is seen exuding\r\non the slightest pressure. In old or wilted specimens it does not flow\r\nso freely, but may be found by breaking off portions of the cap.\r\n\r\nThe plants usually present a fleshy cap, the flesh quite brittle, and\r\nbreaking in clean, even fractures. In a number of the species the upper\r\nsurface of the cap shows bands or zones of warm coloring, not found in\r\nany of the species of the allied genus Russula. The gills are sometimes\r\neven, more often forked, acute on the edge, color white or whitish, but\r\nchanging to yellowish or reddish tints as the plants mature, or when cut\r\nor bruised. While they are at first adnate they become, with the\r\nexpansion of the cap, somewhat decurrent, showing in this particular a\r\nresemblance to the plants of the genus Clitocybe. The stem is central,\r\nexcept in a few species, where it is eccentric or lateral, notably the\r\nlatter in L. _obliquus_; spores white or yellowish, according to\r\nspecies; Cooke says, \"rarely turning yellow.\" They are globose, or\r\nnearly so, and slightly rough.\r\n\r\nThis genus is a large one, and contains many acrid species. Out of\r\nfifty-three described and figured by Cooke, more than half are given as\r\nhaving the milk more or less acrid. More than forty species have been\r\nrecorded as growing in this country, and many of these are extremely\r\nacrid in taste.\r\n\r\nA number of the species are edible, while others have been recorded as\r\ndeleterious, poisonous, etc. L. torminosus, L. piperatus, and L.\r\ninsulsus are species about which there seems to be difference of opinion\r\namong authors as to their wholesomeness or edibility, some contending\r\nthat, in spite of their extreme acridity, they are edible when cooked,\r\nand others that they are deleterious in their effects. L. _deliciosus_\r\nand L. _volemus_ have a good reputation in this country as well as\r\nabroad, and are quite abundant in some localities. They are more\r\nfrequent in temperate climates than in northern latitudes or in the\r\ntropics.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate V.\r\n     LACTARIOUS DELICIOSUS.\r\n     1 General form. 2 Section. 3 Spores.]\r\n\r\n     PLATE V.\r\n\r\n     =Lactarius deliciosus= Fries. \"_Delicious Lactarius_\" _or_ \"_Orange\r\n     Milk Mushroom_.\"\r\n\r\n     EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCap fleshy, viscid, at first convex, then nearly plane, becoming much\r\ndepressed in the centre, funnel-shaped, marked in the adult plant with\r\nrings or rust-colored zones. Color of the cap dull orange, turning\r\npaler, and grayish or greenish yellow when old or dried; margin at first\r\nturned inwards; flesh whitish or tinged with yellow; gills decurrent,\r\ncrowded rather thick, sometimes slightly forked at the base, pale\r\nyellow, sometimes a saffron yellow, exuding when bruised a saffron-red\r\nor orange-colored liquid, hence the popular name of \"Orange Milk\r\nMushroom;\" stem smooth, somewhat spotted, stout, stuffed with a\r\nyellowish pith, eventually becoming hollow; color about the same as that\r\nof the cap. Spores subglobose, yellowish. Taste mild or very slightly\r\nacrid when raw.\r\n\r\nMycophagists generally concur in the opinion that it is of very pleasant\r\nflavor when cooked, and some speak very enthusiastically of its esculent\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nOver-cooking is apt to make it tough. I find steaming in the oven with\r\nbutter, pepper, and salt, and a very small quantity of water, as oysters\r\nare steamed, a very good method of preserving the juices and flavor.\r\n\r\nIt is found in Maryland, under the pines and sometimes in mossy and\r\nswampy places. Prof. Underwood, President of the New York Mycological\r\nClub, reports it as fairly abundant in Connecticut.\r\n\r\nLactarius _volemus_ Fries, the \"Orange-Brown Lactar,\" somewhat resembles\r\nthe L. _deliciosus_ in shape and size, but the cap is dry and glabrous\r\nand the skin is apt to crack in patches in somewhat the same manner as\r\ndoes that of the Russula _virescens_. It is a warm orange-brown in\r\ncolor, varying slightly with age, and is not zoned. The gills are white\r\nor yellowish and crowded, adnate in the young specimens, and decurrent\r\nin the mature, exuding a white milk when bruised. The spores are\r\nglobose, and white. It is found in open woods. The flavor is much like\r\nthat of L. _deliciosus_, although perhaps not so rich.\r\n\r\nOne author states it as his experience that the Lactars which have\r\n_bright_-colored milk, unchanging, are usually edible and have a mild\r\ntaste. L. _indigo_ Schwein has been recorded as less abundant than some\r\nother species, but edible. The plant is a deep blue throughout, the milk\r\nof the same color and unchanging. The taste of both flesh and milk is\r\nmild. Specimens of this species were sent to me from western New York\r\nseveral years ago by a correspondent who found it growing in quantities\r\nin a corn field. He had cooked several dishes of it, and reported its\r\nflavor as very agreeable.\r\n\r\nL. _vellereus_ and L. _piperatus_ are very common in fir woods. The\r\nplants are large and stout, white throughout, the milk white and\r\nexcessively acrid; gills decurrent, unequal and narrow. The milk in\r\n_vellereus_ is apt to be scanty but copious in _piperatus_.\r\n\r\nOf L. _piperatus_, Worthington Smith says: \"So strongly acrid is the\r\nmilk that if it be allowed to trickle over tender hands it will sting\r\nlike the contact of nettles; and if a drop be placed on the lips or\r\ntongue the sensation will be like the scalding of boiling water.\" He\r\nrecords it as \"poisonous.\" Fries and Curtis say that, \"notwithstanding\r\nits intense acridity, it is edible when cooked.\" Cordier, while\r\nrecording it as edible, says that the milk, and butter made from the\r\nmilk of cows fed with it, are bitter and nauseous, although cows eat it\r\nwith avidity. Gibson, while quoting one or two authors as to its\r\nedibility when cooked, says: \"Its decidedly ardent tang warns me not to\r\ndwell too enthusiastically upon its merits in a limited selection of\r\ndesirable esculents.\" The Secretary of the Boston Mycological Club,\r\nwriting in the Club bulletin, says \"it has been eaten as a sort of duty\r\nafter the acridity was cooked out,\" but does not commend it. It is\r\nspoken of as \"an unattractive fungus which usurps in the woods the place\r\nthat might well be occupied by something better.\" In this opinion I\r\nfully concur.\r\n\r\nL. _torminosus_, \"_Wooly Lactarius_,\" sometimes called the \"_Colic\r\nLactarius_,\" has been termed acrid and poisonous by Badham. Cordier and\r\nLetellier, on the other hand, say that it can be eaten with impunity\r\nwhen cooked. Gillet declares it deleterious and even dangerous in the\r\nraw state, constituting a very strong and drastic purgative. One author\r\nstates that, although it does not constitute an agreeable article of\r\nfood, it is eaten in some parts of France and in Russia. Considering the\r\ndifferences of opinion which exist with regard to this and other\r\nextremely acrid species, it would seem the part of prudence for persons\r\nwith delicate stomachs to avoid the use of very acrid species, for,\r\nthough the acridity may be expelled by cooking, there would seem to be\r\nno necessity for risking unpleasant or dangerous results while the range\r\nof unquestionably wholesome and agreeable species is sufficiently wide\r\nto satisfy the most enthusiastic mycophagist.\r\n\r\n     AGARICINI.\r\n\r\n     LEUCOSPORI (SPORES WHITE OR YELLOWISH).\r\n\r\nArmillaria Fries. Cooke places Armillaria in the order Agaricini, _genus\r\nAgaricus_, making of it a _sub_-genus. Saccardo, in taking it out of\r\nAgaricus, elevates it to the position of a separate genus. The name\r\nArmillaria is derived from a Greek word, meaning a ring or bracelet,\r\nreferring to its ringed stem.\r\n\r\nIn the plants of the Armillaria the veil is partial in infancy,\r\nattaching the edge of the cap to the upper part of the stem; the stem\r\nfurnished with a ring. Below the ring the veil is concrete with the\r\nstem, forming scurfy scales upon it. The gills are broadly adnexed. In\r\nabnormal specimens the ring is sometimes absent, or appearing only in\r\nscales, running down the stem. Spores white. The species are few; eight\r\nare recorded as growing in the United States. Cooke describes twelve\r\nspecies found in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate VI.\r\n     AGARICUS (ARMILLARIA) MELLEUS.\r\n     Group from Hynesboro Park, Md., U. S.\r\n     K.

Gills whitish or\r\npaler than the cap, growing mealy with the shedding of the profuse white\r\nspores, and often spotted with reddish-brown stains, adnate, ending with\r\ndecurrent tooth. Stem fibrillose, elastic, stuffed or hollow, ringed,\r\nand adorned with floccose scales which often disappear with age; in some\r\nvarieties distinctly bulbous at the base, in others showing tapering\r\nroot. Specimens occur in which the ring is wanting or only traces of it\r\nappear in the form of scales encircling the stem. Veil usually firm,\r\nmembraneous, and encircling the stem in a well-pronounced ring or\r\ncollar, but sometimes filmy as a spider's web, in very young specimens\r\nhiding the gills, but breaking apart as the cap expands.\r\n\r\nManner of growth caespitose, generally on decayed tree stumps, although\r\nthe group figured in the plate was found growing on moist sand, mixed\r\nwith clay, on a roadside in Hynesbury Park.\r\n\r\nAuthors differ widely as to the value of this species as an esculent. I\r\nhave only eaten the very young and small specimens when cooked, and\r\nfound them very palatable. A Boston mycophagist records it as \"very\r\ngood,\" fried after five minutes' boiling in salted water. Prof. Peck,\r\nhaving tried it, considers it \"a perfectly safe species, but not of\r\nfirst-rate quality.\" It is very common in Maryland and Virginia, and in\r\nthe mountain districts prolific. I have talked with Bohemians and with\r\nGermans who have gathered it in basketfuls in the vicinity of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, who speak well of it, considering it a valuable\r\naddition to the table. Its prolific growth makes it valuable to those\r\nwho like it. There are no species recorded as dangerous in this group.\r\n\r\nAg. (Armillaria) robustus, a very stout species, with a fleshy, compact,\r\nsmooth cap, bay color or tawny, occurs in the Maryland woods, and in the\r\nopen woods of the Massachusetts coast.\r\n\r\n     AGARICINI. Fries.\r\n\r\n_Genus Cantharellus_ Adans. In the plants of this genus the hymenophore\r\nor fleshy substance of the cap is continuous with the stem. They are\r\nfleshy, membranaceous, and putrescent, having neither veil, ring, nor\r\nvolva. The stem is central, except in a few species, where it is\r\nlateral. A characteristic of the genus which separates it from other\r\ngenera of the Agaricini is the vein-like appearance of the gills. They\r\nare very shallow and so obtuse on the edges as to present the appearance\r\nof a network of swollen branching veins. They are usually decurrent and\r\nanastomosing. It is a small genus. Cooke figures nineteen species. Among\r\nthe described species C. cibarius is the only one whose edible qualities\r\nhave been highly recommended. C. umbonatus, a very small plant, found in\r\neastern Massachusetts is commended by those who have eaten it. They are\r\nusually found in woods, and amongst moss. One species, _C. carbonatus_,\r\nis found upon charred ground.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate VII.\r\n     CANTHARELLUS CIBARIUS FR.\r\n     1, 2, 3, 4 Various stages of growth. 5 A section.\r\n     6 Spores. 7 Spores and basidia.\r\n     From Hynesbury, Md., U.

The plant as found in Maryland and Virginia\r\nhas a slightly pungent but agreeable taste when raw, and a pleasant odor\r\nwhen cooked. It is ranked as one of the best of the wood mushrooms by\r\nthose who have eaten it in this locality (District of Columbia). It is\r\nfound here in abundance, after light rains, in fir woods. Berkeley\r\nstates that it is somewhat rare in England, where it is held as a\r\ndelicacy, but quite common on the continent. We have had specimens from\r\nvarious localities throughout the States. Cooke says the spores are\r\nwhite. Peck and Gibson record them as yellow. I find them white,\r\nsometimes slightly tinted with yellow.\r\n\r\nThe _Chantarelle_ takes its name from a Greek word signifying a cup or\r\nvase, referring to its shape and possibly also to its rich golden color;\r\n_cibarius_ refers to its esculent qualities.\r\n\r\nThe variety _rufipes_ Gillet closely resembles C. _cibarius_, but is\r\ndarker, with the stem _rufous_, reddish, at the base.\r\n\r\nC. _aurantiacus_ Fries bears a sufficient resemblance to C. _cibarius_\r\nto be sometimes taken for it, although the cap is tomentose and of a\r\nmuch deeper orange in tint, the gills more crowded, darker than the cap,\r\nand the stem less stout. In the variety _pallidus_ the whole plant is\r\nvery light or buff yellow, and the gills nearly white. C. aurantiacus\r\nhas been recorded as poisonous or unwholesome by some of the earlier\r\nauthors, others say that they have eaten it, but do not commend it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECEIPTS FOR COOKING.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stuffed Morels._--Choose the freshest and lightest colored Morels, open\r\nthe stalk at the base, fill with minced veal and bread-crumbs, secure\r\nthe ends of the stalk and place between thin slices of bacon.\r\n\r\nThe Morel should not be gathered immediately after heavy rains, as it\r\nbecomes insipid with much moisture. The flavor is said to grow stronger\r\nin drying.\r\n\r\n_Escalloped Mushrooms._--(From Mr. Frank Caywood, Fredericktown, Ohio,\r\nNovember 14, 1893.) Season as directed in the usual methods for\r\nmushrooms and add a small quantity of vinegar to hasten the cooking.\r\nCook slowly until tender; rapid boiling evaporates the flavor. When\r\ndone, put in from a pint to a quart of sweet milk and heat. Take a\r\npudding dish and put in a layer of broken crackers; light milk crackers\r\nare the best. Put lumps of butter and pepper and salt over the crackers.\r\nNext a layer of the tender mushrooms with some of the hot gravy and\r\nmilk. Continue these layers until the dish is full, having a layer of\r\ncrackers on top. Place the dish in the oven and bake slowly until the\r\ncrackers are browned.\r\n\r\n_Mushroom Fritters._--Take nice large tops, season, and dip into batter\r\nand fry in hot butter as other fritters.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms en ragout._--Put into a stewpan a little \"stock,\" a small\r\nquantity of vinegar, parsley, and green onions chopped up, salt and\r\nspices. When this is about to boil, the cleaned mushrooms are put in.\r\nWhen done remove them from the fire and thicken with yolks of eggs.\r\n\r\nThe Lactarius _deliciosus_ may be served with a white sauce or fried.\r\nBadham says the best way to cook them is to season first with pepper,\r\nsalt, and small pieces of butter, and bake in a closely covered pie dish\r\nfor about three quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\nThe Cantharellus, being somewhat dry, requires more fluid sauce in\r\ncooking than the juicier mushrooms, and is best minced and slowly stewed\r\nuntil quite tender. Some advise soaking it in milk a few hours before\r\ncooking. The Italians dry or pickle it or keep it in oil for winter use.\r\n\r\nPersoon gives the following recipes for cooking the Morel: 1st. Wash and\r\ncleanse thoroughly, as the earth is apt to collect between the ridges;\r\ndry and put them in a saucepan with pepper, salt, and parsley, adding or\r\nnot a piece of bacon; stew for an hour, pouring in occasionally a little\r\nbroth to prevent burning; when sufficiently done, bind with the yolks of\r\ntwo or three eggs, and serve on buttered toast.\r\n\r\n2. _Morelles a l'Italienne._--Having washed and dried, divide them\r\nacross, put them on the fire with some parsley, scallion, chives,\r\ntarragon, a little salt, and two spoonfuls of fine oil. Stew till the\r\njuice runs out, then thicken with a little flour; serve with bread\r\ncrumbs and a squeeze of lemon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM GROWING.[A]\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] A part of the matter presented under this caption was contributed by\r\nthe author to the Health Magazine and appeared in the March number\r\n(1897) of that periodical.\r\n\r\nTo France is due the credit of being the first country to cultivate\r\nmushrooms on a large scale, and France still supplies the markets of the\r\nworld with canned mushrooms. The mushroom which is cultivated in the\r\ncaves and quarries of France, to the exclusion of all others, is the\r\nAgaricus arvensis (the \"Snowball\"), a species of field mushroom.\r\n\r\nOf late years France has found a formidable competitor in the culture of\r\nmushrooms in Great Britain. The English market gardeners find their\r\nmoist, equable climate favorable to outdoor culture, and abundant crops\r\nare grown by them in the open air, chiefly, however, for the home\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThat mushroom growing can be made a lucrative business is shown by the\r\nexperience of a well-known English grower, Mr. J. F. Barter, who on one\r\nacre of ground has produced in the open air, without the aid of glass,\r\nan average of from ten to twelve thousand pounds of mushrooms annually;\r\nthe price obtained for them varying according to the season, but\r\naveraging ten pence, or twenty cents, per pound for the whole year. The\r\nvalue of twelve thousand pounds of mushrooms at ten pence per pound\r\nwould be L.500 sterling or $2,500.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of comparison the following are quoted from the Pall\r\nMall Gazette, as exceptional prices realized in England for other fruits\r\nand vegetables in recent years:\r\n\r\nPounds sterling per statute acre:\r\n\r\nVery early gooseberries, 100; onions, 192; early lettuces, 100; plums,\r\n100; potatoes, 100; strawberries, 150; black currants, 168; filberts,\r\n200.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that onions and filberts head the list, but the product\r\nof an acre of mushrooms has been shown to be worth more than double that\r\nof either filberts or onions.\r\n\r\nIn the localities specially favorable to hop growing 30 cwt. of hops to\r\nthe acre is considered exceptional, while the average price has been\r\nquoted at 3 pounds sterling, or about one-fifth of the sum obtained from\r\nMr. Barter's acre of mushrooms. Three months in the year the weather\r\ndoes not favor outdoor culture, and these months Mr. Barter spends in\r\nmanufacturing brick spawn, which he exports to this and other countries.\r\nAmong those who have been very successful in indoor culture are Mr.\r\nWilliam Robinson, editor of the \"London Garden,\" and Mr. Horace Cox,\r\nmanager of the \"Field.\"\r\n\r\nIn America, where mushroom culture is still comparatively in its\r\ninfancy, there have already been obtained very encouraging results by\r\npainstaking growers. Most of the cultivation has been in the northern\r\nand midwestern States, where the climatic conditions seemed most\r\nfavorable to indoor culture. A few figures as to the revenue obtained in\r\nthis way may be interesting to readers.\r\n\r\nAn experienced Pennsylvania grower states that from a total area of\r\n5,500 square feet of beds, made up in two mushroom houses, he obtained a\r\ncrop of 5,000 pounds of mushrooms in one season, or about one pound to\r\nthe square foot. These sold at an average of a little over 50 cents per\r\npound. A third house, with 19,000 square feet of beds, produced 2,800\r\npounds, or one and one-half pounds to the square foot. This house\r\nyielded a net profit of one thousand dollars. This, however, can be\r\nquoted only as showing the possibilities of careful culture by\r\nexperienced growers under very favorable circumstances. Amateurs could\r\nscarcely expect such good results. Three-fourths of a pound to the\r\nsquare foot would probably come nearer the average. A Philadelphia\r\ngrower gives the average price secured from fifty shipments of mushrooms\r\nin one season at 54 cents per pound. New York dealers report higher\r\nrates than this. A Washington florist who utilizes the lower shelves of\r\nhis propagating houses for the purpose of mushroom growing informed me\r\nthat during two seasons he received 60 cents per pound wholesale,\r\nshipping to New York, and that he sold one thousand dollars worth in one\r\nseason. Mr. Denton, a market gardener of Long Island, who cultivates in\r\nhouses built for the purpose, markets from 1,700 to 2,500 pounds per\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThus far the market is in the hands of a comparatively few dealers in\r\nthe neighborhood of large cities, but there is certainly no good reason\r\nwhy the growing of mushrooms should not be more generally undertaken by\r\nthe farming community. Certainly no one has better facilities than are\r\nat the command of the enterprising American farmer. On most farms the\r\nconditions are favorable or could easily be made so for mushroom\r\nculture, on a moderate scale, at least. Generally there are disused\r\nsheds, old barns, etc., which with a small outlay could be transformed\r\ninto mushroom houses, and where timber is plentiful the cost of building\r\na small mushroom house would be repaid by the profits accruing from the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIn the culture of mushrooms there are open, to the enterprising with\r\nsmall capital, four sources of profit: first, the sale of the fresh\r\nmushrooms; second, the manufacture of mushroom catsup; third, the\r\ncanning of the small button mushroom for exportation; and, fourth, the\r\nmanufacture of spawn.\r\n\r\nIt is well in this, as in all new industries, to begin in a small way,\r\nand if success is attained it is easy to extend operations on a larger\r\nscale. My advice to amateurs is to begin with one or two beds in a\r\nwell-drained cellar or shed where good ventilation and even temperature\r\ncan be secured at moderate cost. In the underground cellar economy is\r\nsecured by the saving in fuel. The beds can be made on the floor, flat,\r\nridged or banked against the wall, ten or twelve inches deep in a warm\r\ncellar, and from fifteen to twenty inches in a cool cellar. The boxing\r\nfor the sides and ends may be built six or eight inches higher than the\r\nbeds to give the mushrooms plenty of head room.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR PREPARING THE COMPOST FOR THE BEDS.\r\n\r\nProcure not less than a cartload of clean, fresh stable manure. Place it\r\nunder cover, to protect it from rain and drain water, mix well and heap\r\nup the whole mass into a mound three feet high then beat the mound\r\nfirmly down to prevent undue heating. Repeat this operation every other\r\nday until its rank smell is gone, taking care that on each turning the\r\noutside dry manure is placed in the centre of the mound. By this means\r\nthe stable odor is dissipated while its heating properties are equally\r\ndistributed. Add to this from one-fourth to one-fifth of clean, rich\r\ngarden mould. Mix well. After this careful handling, the mass may be\r\nconsidered fit for bedding purposes. When placed in the beds the mass\r\nshould be compacted again by beating with the back of a spade or trowel.\r\nThe bed surface should appear moist but not wet, smooth and of firm\r\nconsistence. From day to day it will be necessary to test its general\r\ntemperature by means of a thermometer. To this end make at various\r\nplaces at different depths openings sufficiently large to admit the use\r\nof a thermometer. It will be found that the temperature is highest\r\nnearest the bottom. Test at various points. At first the temperature\r\nwill run high; 105 to 120 Fahrenheit is probably as high as it will\r\nreach, but in a few days it will fall to 85 or 80 Fahrenheit. At this\r\npoint spawn the bed. For this purpose make holes in the top of the bed\r\nabout six inches apart and two inches deep with a blunt dibble or broom\r\nhandle. Place in these holes or openings a piece of brick spawn about\r\nthe size of a hen's egg, and cover the holes with manure; finish by\r\npacking the same, keeping the surface of the bed smooth and moist. The\r\nspawn should be slightly moistened before using. Should the surface of\r\nthe bed become dry, use water from a fine sprinkling pan. The\r\ntemperature of the cellar or house in which the bed may be placed should\r\nrange between 55 and 75, and should not be lower than 50. If the\r\nspawn is good and all conditions attended to, the white filaments should\r\nappear spreading through the bed within eight or ten days after\r\nspawning. When the white spawn is observed on or near the surface, cover\r\nthe whole surface with from one to two inches of garden loam well\r\npulverized. A good general rule for spawning the bed is to wait until\r\nthe heat of the bed is on the decline and has fallen to at least 90\r\nFahrenheit. If the heat in the middle of the bed runs too high the\r\nspawn is killed. The experience of a number of growers has shown that a\r\nbed spawned at 60 to 80 and kept at 55 after the mushrooms appear\r\ngives better results than one spawned at 90.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the manure makes some difference in its temperature. That\r\nobtained from stables where horses are grass fed will be of lower normal\r\ntemperature and will chill quicker than that obtained from corn or oat\r\nfed stock.\r\n\r\nA solution of saltpeter in proportion of about fifteen grains to a quart\r\nof water, occasionally spread over the bed with a fine hose, helps to\r\naccelerate the growth of the mushrooms.\r\n\r\nThe proper condition of the manure as regards dryness or moistness can\r\nbe readily ascertained by squeezing it in the hand; it should be\r\nunctuous enough to hold together in a lump, and so dry that you cannot\r\nsqueeze a drop of water out of it. Excessive moisture in the manure has\r\nbeen often a cause of failure. It should be remembered also that when\r\nthe heat of the manure is on the decline it falls rapidly, five, often\r\nten degrees a day, till it reaches about 75, and between that and 65\r\nit may rest for weeks.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal causes of the failure of mushroom culture in this\r\ncountry is the use of old or poor spawn. Good spawn should have a fresh,\r\nmushroomy odor, and a bluish-white appearance on the surface. In buying\r\nspawn one should always go to reliable seedsmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOST FOR MUSHROOM BEDS.\r\n\r\nSawdust has been used in England for mushroom beds, after having been\r\nused for stable bedding, with very good results. It has also been used\r\nsuccessfully in the District of Columbia. In fact, the very large models\r\nof cultivated mushrooms exhibited by the Division of Microscopy of the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture at the World's Fair in Chicago were moulded\r\nfrom mushrooms which were grown on the writer's premises, in a\r\ncomposition of sawdust stable bedding, combined with about one-fourth\r\ngarden mould, but I am confident, at the same time, that much depends on\r\nthe kind of timber the sawdust is made from. In this case the sawdust\r\ncame from spruce.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM CULTURE IN CANADA.\r\n\r\nA Canadian correspondent informs me that he, with others, has been very\r\nsuccessful in growing mushrooms in the open air during the summer months\r\nin Canada, and gives the following directions for preparing the beds in\r\nthe colder latitudes:\r\n\r\nPlace under a shed such amount of clean stable manure as may be required\r\nfor the beds, turning it over and over until all free ammonia has\r\nescaped and the tendency of undue fermentation and evolution of high\r\ntemperature has greatly modified. To effect this, it is necessary to\r\nheap up the manure each time in a mound, say three feet high after\r\nturning, and beat it firmly down (the exclusion of free air prevents\r\noverheating). To put the manure in proper condition for use in the beds,\r\nfrom two to four weeks' treatment may be required, but much depends on\r\nthe quality of the manure and temperature of the atmosphere. Before\r\nmaking the beds, and several days after the last turning, test the\r\ninternal temperature of the mound in the following manner: Make a hole\r\nwith a broomstick through the mound from top to bottom, and suspend a\r\nthermometer half way down in the hole for, say, an hour. The temperature\r\nmay be as high as 150 F. After the lapse of the time stated, beat the\r\nmound more firmly down to prevent rise of temperature. Test again two\r\ndays after in the same manner. If the temperature has risen several\r\ndegrees the mound must be again taken down, turned over, and remade. If,\r\non the other hand, the temperature has fallen to 100 F., the permanent\r\nbed may be made. If indoor growth is desired, such as a cellar,\r\noutbuilding, or cave, the atmosphere must not fall below 50 F., nor be\r\nover 80 F. Air drafts cannot be permitted. The floor must be dry and\r\nthe atmosphere moist. The cellar may be dark, or moderately light.\r\nGrowers differ in opinion in this respect. Growers generally add to the\r\nmanure about one-fourth or one-fifth garden soil, but success has been\r\nattained without the use of garden soil, except as surface dressing\r\nafter spawning the bed; an excessive use of loam, in any case, tends to\r\nlower the temperature too rapidly. Having prepared a box or frame-work\r\nfor the bed twelve inches deep, fill it up to within two inches of the\r\ntop; beat gently down with a board, or a brick, until it is even and\r\ncompact. On the following day make holes in the bed, with a dibble, ten\r\ninches deep, in which suspend a thermometer half way down for an hour.\r\nShould the temperature have fallen to 90 F., cover lightly with straw\r\nand test on the following day. Should the temperature prove to be going\r\ndown, say to 80 F., or 85 F., it is safe to plant the spawn; but\r\nshould the temperature be on the rise, wait until it is falling. One\r\ngrower has stated that his greatest success has been when the spawn was\r\nplanted at the temperature of 75 F. Should the temperature fall too\r\nquickly and the surface be too dry, sprinkle with water at blood heat,\r\nusing a very fine hose, and cover the bed with straw.\r\n\r\nThe spawn brick should be cut into pieces, about the size of an egg, and\r\nplanted in holes made in the bed, about two inches deep and about six\r\ninches apart. The holes are then filled up and about two inches of\r\ngarden soil sifted over the surface of the bed. Tamp the bed surface\r\ngently with the back of a spade. Mushrooms may be expected for table use\r\nin about six or seven weeks, provided the spawn is good and the\r\ntemperature has not fallen below 50 F. In outdoor culture the beds must\r\nbe well covered with straw or canvas, and had better be under a shed\r\nroof with southern exposure.\r\n\r\nThe spawn used by this grower is the \"brick\" spawn, imported from Carter\r\n& Holborn, London, England.\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF MUSHROOMS IN JAPAN.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese are very successful in cultivating a mushroom which they\r\ncall \"Shiitake\" or \"Lepiota shiitake.\" China also produces the same\r\nmushroom, but of an inferior quality. The Chinese therefore prefer the\r\nmushroom cultivated by the Japanese, which they import from Japan in\r\nlarge quantities. It is cultivated on a variety of trees, but is said to\r\ngrow best on the \"Shiinoki,\" a species of oak (Quercus cuspidata).\r\n\r\nThere are three varieties of \"Shiitake,\" the spring, summer, and autumn\r\ncrops differing somewhat in quality. The method of growing the\r\n\"Shiitake\" is given by the Japanese Commissioner of Agriculture as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Trees of from twenty to fifty years' growth are cut down at the\r\napproach of winter when the sap has ceased to run, and after the lapse\r\nof twenty or thirty days, according to the condition of the drying of\r\nthe wood, are sawed into logs of 4 or 5 feet in length. Into each of\r\nthese logs incisions are made with a hatchet, at intervals of about 6\r\ninches, and they are piled regularly upon a frame-work erected at a\r\nheight of about 1 foot above the ground, under the trees. The location\r\nof the ground selected for piling the logs should be the slopes of a\r\nforest, facing southeast or southwest. After keeping the logs as above\r\ndescribed for from two to three years, they are immersed in water for\r\ntwenty-four hours in the middle of November, and again laid one upon\r\nanother for about four days; if it is in a cold district, the pile is\r\ncovered with straw or mats. At the expiration of the fourth day the logs\r\nare obliquely tilted against poles fixed horizontally to the trees at a\r\nheight of about 4 feet in a well-ventilated and sunny situation. The\r\nmushrooms soon appear in quantity, and, after twenty or thirty days'\r\ngrowth, are ready for harvesting.\"\r\n\r\nRecent reports of the Japanese Agricultural Department show the total\r\nvalue of the annual export of \"Shiitake\" to be nearly five hundred\r\nthousand \"yen\" (silver).\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURE OF SPAWN.\r\n\r\nAs many tons of artificial spawn are yearly imported into this country,\r\nit would seem that the manufacture of spawn in the United States might\r\nprove a profitable form of investment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"BRICK SPAWN.\"\r\n\r\nFor commercial purposes the English method of making the spawn into\r\nbricks has some advantages over the French \"flake\" process. Its compact\r\nand uniform shape makes the brick more convenient for storage and\r\ngeneral handling, and greatly facilitates its transportation to long\r\ndistances. Brick spawn is made in the following manner: Clean horse\r\ndroppings, cow manure, loam, and road sweepings are beaten up in a\r\nmortar-like consistency and then formed into bricks, moulds being used,\r\nslightly differing in shape with different makers, but usually thinner\r\nand wider than common building bricks. The following proportions are\r\ngiven: (1) Horse droppings the chief part; one-fourth cow dung;\r\nremainder loam. (2) Fresh horse droppings mixed with short litter for\r\nthe greater part; cow dung, one third; and the rest mould or loam. (3)\r\nHorse dung, cow dung, and loam, in equal parts. When about half dry,\r\ndepressions are made in the bricks, sometimes in the centre, and\r\nsometimes in each corner, and small pieces of good spawn are placed in\r\nthese depressions, and plastered over with the material of the brick.\r\nThe cakes are then laid out to dry, standing on their edges, and when\r\nnearly dry are piled in pairs with the spawn-larded surfaces face to\r\nface. The bricks are then stacked away, and covered with sweet\r\nfermenting litter, sufficiently to cause a heat of 60 F. It should not\r\nbe over 70 F. One spawn manufacturer says that the most rapid and\r\nsuccessful growth of the mycelium is attained when the temperature is\r\nfrom 63 F. to 67 F. The bricks are examined frequently during the\r\nprocess, and when the mycelium of the old spawn has permeated the whole\r\nmass like a fine white mould, the bricks are taken out and dried in a\r\nwell-ventilated dark place. They are then placed in a cool, dark\r\nstorehouse, where they are not subject to dampness and where the\r\ntemperature is about 50 F., not over 65 or below 35 F. Slight\r\nventilation is necessary, but not enough to make the bricks dust-dry.\r\nKeeping the spawn dry merely suspends its growth; as soon as it is again\r\nsubmitted to favorable conditions of moisture and heat, its pristine\r\nactivity returns. Dampness, combined with heat, stimulates the growth of\r\nmycelium; frost also destroys the vitality of the spawn. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that these conditions should not exist in the store-room.\r\n\r\nOne manufacturer advocates piling the bricks, after spawning, on a clay\r\nfloor, packing closely four bricks deep, and covering them with sifted\r\nloam. By this method it is claimed that danger of \"fire fang\" will be\r\navoided, as the bricks will be kept at a perfectly uniform temperature\r\nof about 60 or 66, which causes the spawn to run quickly and\r\nuniformly. In from four to six weeks they are ready to take out and dry\r\nfor use or storage.\r\n\r\nThe French or \"Flake\" spawn comes in light masses of loose, dry litter.\r\nIt is obtained in the following way: A bed is made up as if for\r\nmushrooms in the ordinary way, and spawned with \"virgin\" spawn, and when\r\nthe bed is thoroughly impregnated with spawn, it is broken up and set\r\naside to dry. This spawn is usually sold in small boxes, containing from\r\ntwo to five pounds, but it also can be obtained in bulk when it is\r\npurchased by weight. The French or \"flake\" spawn is much more expensive\r\nthan the English or \"brick\" spawn. It is claimed by some very successful\r\ngrowers, who have tried both, that the brick spawn produces heavier and\r\nfleshier mushrooms than the French \"flake.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"MILL TRACK\" SPAWN.\r\n\r\n\"Mill track\" spawn was formerly considered the best in England, but\r\nsince horse power has given place to steam power in the mills there is\r\nnow no further supply of mill track, and it is practically superseded by\r\nthe \"brick\" spawn. The real \"mill track\" is the natural spawn that has\r\nspread through the thoroughly amalgamated horse droppings in mill\r\ntracks, or the sweepings from mill tracks.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAWN PRODUCED IN A MANURE HEAP.\r\n\r\nDuring the past year I have made some experiments in the pine and oak\r\nwoods of Hynesboro' Park, Maryland, with relation to spawn culture, an\r\naccount of which may prove of interest to students in this line of\r\ninvestigation. Several loads of stable manure and oak-leaf bedding were\r\nwell mixed and formed into a mound about three feet in height, having a\r\ndiameter of six feet, and tapering to about four inches in depth at the\r\nouter edge. The mass was quite moist and slightly tamped to give it\r\ngeneral consistency. It was exposed to the open air, without protection,\r\nduring the months of September, October, and November. In the meantime,\r\nfrequent rains occurred. On examination it was found that the rains did\r\nnot penetrate to a depth of more than four inches. On opening up the\r\ncentre of the mound, it was observed that the portion thus exposed\r\nconsisted of highly decomposed leaves, and presented a white mass of\r\nmatted, \"burned\" mycelium. It was evident that the temperature at that\r\npoint had risen considerably above 100 Fahr. The mycelium was,\r\ndoubtless, produced in abundance before the temperature reached 100\r\nFahr. and became scorched as the temperature increased. On examining the\r\nouter edges, where the depth was only twelve inches, I found an\r\nabundance of mycelium which did not show any appearance of having been\r\nscorched by undue temperature. Since no mycelium had been added to the\r\nmound, it is evident that the spores which produced it must have been\r\npresent, although unobserved, and awaiting only the proper conditions\r\nfor development, _i. e._, for budding and the production of mycelium. At\r\nthe end of the third month, groups of the common meadow mushroom,\r\nAgaricus campestris, together with some fine examples of Tricholoma\r\nterreum, an edible mushroom, common to these woods, appeared on the\r\nedges of the mound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\nCONTINUATION OF GLOSSARY OF TERMS USED IN DESCRIBING MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Maculate_, spotted.\r\n\r\n_Marginate_, having a distinct border.\r\n\r\n_Matrix_, the substance upon which a mushroom grows.\r\n\r\n_Medial_, at the middle;

D.,\r\n                                   and\r\n                             A. R. Taylor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     AGARICINI.\r\n\r\n_Subgenus Hypholoma_. Hymenophore continuous with the stem, veil woven\r\ninto a fugacious web, which adheres to the margin of the pileus. Gills\r\nadnate or sinuate; spores brownish purple, sometimes intense purple,\r\nalmost black.--M. C. Cooke.\r\n\r\nThis subgenus has been divided into the following five groups:\r\n\r\n1. Fasciculares.--Pileus smooth, tough, bright colored when dry, not\r\nhygrophanous. Examples, Ag. (Hypholoma) _sublateritius_ and Ag.\r\n(Hypholoma) _fascicularis_.\r\n\r\n2. Viscidi.--Pileus naked, viscid. Example, Ag. (Hypholoma) _oedipus_.\r\n\r\n3. Velutini.--Pileus silky, with innate fibrils. Example, Ag.\r\n(Hypholoma) _velutinus_.\r\n\r\n4. Flocculosi.--Pileus clad with floccose superficial evanescent scales.\r\nExample, Ag. (Hypholoma) _cascus_.\r\n\r\n5. Appendiculati.--Pileus smooth and hygrophanous. Example, Ag.\r\n(Hypholoma) _Candollianus_.\r\n\r\nThe species are not numerous. They are generally either gregarious or\r\ncaespitose, and are often found in clusters upon tree stumps, or\r\nspringing from the buried roots of stumps. A few species are found in\r\nshort grass in open places; but few are recorded as edible, and one, H.\r\n_fascicularis_, has been classed as deleterious by Berkeley, Cooke, and\r\nsome of the earlier authors. I find, however, no authenticated case of\r\npoisoning by this species, and, indeed, have as yet found no species of\r\nHypholoma which could be satisfactorily identified as H. fascicularis.\r\n\r\nThe few species of Hypholoma which I have tested have been palatable,\r\nand one or two are of very delicate flavor.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate VIII.\r\n     EDIBLE\r\n     Agaricus (Hypholoma) _sublateritius_ Fries (Hypholoma sublatertium)\r\n     \"Brick Top.\"\r\n     Group from Seabrooke Woods, Md.\r\n     T. Taylor, del.]\r\n\r\n     PLATE VIII.\r\n\r\n     =Ag. (Hypholoma) sublateritius= Schaeff. \"_Red Tuft_.\" (=Hypholoma\r\n     sublateritium=) \"_The Brick Top_.\"\r\n\r\n     EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nThe cap of this species is fleshy and obtuse, convexo-plane, sometimes\r\nshowing a superficial whitish cloudiness upon the margin coming from the\r\nveil, which soon disappears, leaving it smooth and dry; color tawny\r\nbrick red, with pale straw margin; flesh compact and whitish, turning\r\nyellow when wilted. Stem stuffed and fibrillose, tapering downward. Near\r\nits attachment to the cap the color is very light yellow; lower down and\r\ntowards the root it is covered with patches and lines of burnt sienna\r\ncolor. It bears no distinct ring. In very young plants the filmy veil is\r\nsometimes perceived, reaching from the margin of the cap to the stem.\r\nThis disappears as the cap expands, sometimes leaving the stem obscurely\r\nannulate. Gills adnate in full-grown specimens, slightly decurrent,\r\nsomewhat crowded, dingy white or cinereous, turning to dark olive, never\r\nyellow; in old or wilted specimens changing to a dark brown. In old\r\nspecimens the cap is a reddish brown and the gills are sometimes stained\r\nwith the purplish brown of the spores.\r\n\r\nThis is a very common species and very abundant in pine and oak woods. I\r\nhave seen an oak stump in Prince George's County, Md., measuring from 3\r\nto 4 feet in height, literally covered with mushrooms of this species.\r\nThis mushroom has been recorded as suspicious by some writers, probably\r\nowing to its slightly bitter taste, but I have thoroughly tested its\r\nedible qualities, both uncooked and prepared in various ways for the\r\ntable, using the caps only. It keeps well when dried, and when ground\r\ninto powder, with the addition of boiling water and a little pepper and\r\nsalt, makes a very pleasant and nutritious beverage. It is most abundant\r\nin the early autumn, and is gathered in this latitude well into the\r\nwinter, even when the snow is on the ground.\r\n\r\nOur American plant is less heavy and more graceful in aspect than the\r\nsame species in England, as figured in English works, but the general\r\ncharacteristics are the same.\r\n\r\nAg. (Hypholoma) _fascicularis_ Hudson, recorded as deleterious, is\r\nfigured in \"Cooke's Illustrations.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Berkeley thus distinguishes these two species from each other. Cap\r\nof _sublateritius_ is obtuse, discoid; that of _fascicularis_,\r\nsubumbonate. Flesh of the former, compact, dingy-white; that of the\r\nlatter, yellow. Stem in _sublateritius_ is \"stuffed,\" attenuated\r\ndownwards, ferruginous; stem of _fascicularis_ hollow, thin, flexuose.\r\nThe gills in both species are adnate, crowded; but in _fascicularis_\r\nthey are also linear and deliquescent, and are _yellow_ in color.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--In the Friesian arrangement of the genera of the order Agaricini,\r\nwhich is adopted by M. C. Cooke, Hypholoma finds place as a subgenus of\r\nthe genus Agaricus, spore series Pratelli. Saccardo in his Sylloge\r\nelevates Hypholoma to the rank of a separate genus and places it in his\r\nspore series Melanosporae.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate IX.\r\n     EDIBLE\r\n     Agaricus (Hypholoma) _Candollianus_, Fries., variety _incertus_ Peck\r\n     Figured from specimens collected in the District of Columbia\r\n     T. Taylor, del.]\r\n\r\n     PLATE IX.\r\n\r\n     =Agaricus (Hypholoma) incertus= Peck. (_Hypholoma incertum_.)\r\n\r\n     EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCap fleshy but fragile, smooth and hygrophanous, moist; at first convex,\r\nthen expanding; color creamy white. Gills adnate, narrow, crowded,\r\nwhitish in young specimens, turning to a pinkish dun color, later to a\r\nrosy cinnamon, sometimes showing when mature a slightly purplish tint.\r\nStem smooth, slender, long and hollow, with slight striations near the\r\napex, white. Specimens occur in which the stem is obscurely annulate\r\narising from the attachment to it of fragments of the veil, but usually\r\nit is ringless.\r\n\r\nThe typical species of Hypholoma have the fleshy part of the cap\r\nconfluent with the stem, but in H. _incertum_ the stem is not confluent\r\nand is easily separated from the cap as in the Lepiotas. This mushroom\r\nwas first recorded by Peck in his early reports as the variety\r\n\"_incertus_\" of the species Agaricus (Hypholoma) Candollianus, but has\r\nsince been recorded by Saccardo as a distinct species, Hypholoma\r\nincertum.\r\n\r\nTwo species of Hypholoma have the same habit and sufficiently resemble\r\n_incertum_ to be taken for it, if not carefully examined as to points of\r\ndifference. These are H. _Candollianum_, named in honor of A. De\r\nCandolle, and H. _appendiculatum_. In the first named of these two\r\nspecies the cap is whitish, the gills at first violet in color, changing\r\nto dark cinnamon brown. In H. appendiculatum the pileus is rugose when\r\ndry, and sprinkled with atoms. It is darker in color than that of H.\r\nincertum; Cooke says tawny or pale ochre; Massee says bay, then tawny.\r\nThe gills are sub-adnate, in color resembling those of H. incertum; stem\r\nslender, smooth, and white.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that H. _incertum_ agrees more nearly\r\nwith H. _Candollianum_ in the color of the cap, but more nearly with H.\r\n_appendiculatum_ in the color of the gills. Saccardo recognizes the\r\nthree as \"distinct species of the _genus Hypholoma_.\" As all are edible,\r\nthe slight differences observed are interesting chiefly to the\r\nmycologist. The mycophagist will find them equally valuable from a\r\ngastronomic point of view. In taste they resemble the common mushroom.\r\nThey are more fragile, however, and require less cooking than the\r\ncultivated mushroom. Broiled on toast or cooked for ten minutes in a\r\nchafing dish, they make a very acceptable addition to the lunch menu.\r\n\r\nThe specimens figured in Plate IX were selected from a crop of thirty or\r\nmore growing in the author's garden, in very rich soil at the base of a\r\nplum-tree stump. For several seasons past small crops have been gathered\r\nfrom the same spot, as well as around the base of a flourishing peach\r\ntree. Quantities of all three species have been gathered in the short\r\ngrass of the Capitol grounds for a number of seasons, and in the various\r\nparks of the District of Columbia. Specimens have been received from\r\nwestern New York and Massachusetts. Those growing upon soil very heavily\r\nfertilized are apt to be somewhat stouter and shorter stemmed than those\r\ncoming up through the short grass in the parks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYTICAL TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following compendious analytical table showing prominent\r\ncharacteristics of the leading genera and subgenera of the order\r\nAgaricini, according to Fries, Worthington Smith, and other botanists,\r\nwhich appears in Cooke's Hand Book, revised edition, will be found\r\nhelpful to the collector in determining the genus to which a specimen\r\nmay belong.\r\n\r\n  ORDER AGARICINI\r\n\r\n  I.

The genera are printed in capitals. In the Saccardian\r\nsystem, all the _subgenera_ of _Agaricus_ having been elevated to\r\n_generic_ rank, the term Agaricus is limited to a very small group which\r\nincludes the _subgenus Psalliota_ of Fries, the species being\r\ncharacterized by fleshy caps, free gills, ringed stem, and dark brown or\r\npurplish brown spores. As restricted, it naturally falls into the spore\r\nseries _Melanosporeae._\r\n\r\nIn the white-spored section, Leucospori, the recorded edible species\r\noccur in the following genera: Marasmius, Cantharellus, Lactarius,\r\nRussula, Hygrophorus, Collybia, Pleurotus, Clitocybe, Tricholoma,\r\nArmillaria, Lepiota, and Amanita. The plants of Marasmius are usually\r\nthin and dry, reviving with moisture. Cantharellus is characterized by\r\nthe obtuseness of the edges of the lamellae, Lactarius by the copious\r\nmilky or sticky fluid which exudes from the plants when cut or bruised.\r\nRussula is closely allied to Lactarius, and the plants bear some\r\nresemblance in external appearance to those of that genus, but they are\r\nnever milky, and the gills are usually rigid and brittle. In Hygrophorus\r\nthe plants are moist, not very large, often bright colored, and the\r\ngills have a waxy appearance. The Collybias are usually caespitose, the\r\nstems exteriorly cartilaginous, in some species swelling and splitting\r\nopen in the centre.\r\n\r\nIn Pleurotus the stem is lateral or absent. The plants are epiphytal,\r\nusually springing from the decaying bark of trees and old stumps.\r\n\r\nIn Clitocybe the plants are characterized by a deeply depressed, often\r\nnarrow cap, with the gills acutely adnate, or running far down the stem,\r\nwhich is elastic, with a fibrous outer coat covered with minute fibers.\r\nMany of the species have a fragrant odor. The Tricholomas are stout and\r\nfleshy, somewhat resembling the Russulas, but distinguished from them by\r\nthe sinuate character of the gills, which show a slight notched or\r\ntoothed depression just before reaching the stem (represented in Fig. 4,\r\nPlate IV). Typical species of Armillaria show a well-defined ring and\r\nscales upon the stem, the remains of the partial veil, and the plants\r\nare usually large, and caespitose. The Lepiotas are recognized by the\r\nsoft, thready character of the fleshy portion of the cap, and the\r\nfringed scales formed by the breaking of the cuticle. The ease with\r\nwhich the ringed stem is removed from its socket in the cap is another\r\ncharacteristic which distinguishes the plants from those of other\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\nThe Amanitas are distinguished by the volva, which sheathes the somewhat\r\nbulbous stem at its base and the ring and veil which in the young plant\r\nare very distinct features, the whole plant in embryo being enveloped in\r\nthe volva.\r\n\r\nThe Amanita group, besides containing some very good edible species, is\r\nalso credited with containing the most dangerous species of all the\r\nmushroom family, and some which are undoubtedly fatal in their\r\neffects.[A]\r\n\r\n[A] A more detailed description of this group will appear in No. 5 of\r\nthis series.\r\n\r\nThe Nyctali are minute mushrooms parasitic on other mushrooms.\r\n\r\nIn Omphalia, the plants are quite small, with membranaceous caps, gills\r\ntruly decurrent, and cartilaginous stems.\r\n\r\nThe Myceneae are generally very small, slender, and fragile, usually\r\ncaespitose, with bell-shaped caps, sinuate gills, not decurrent, and\r\ncartilaginous stems. In some species the plants exude a milky juice.\r\n\r\nIn the genera Panus, Lentinus, Lenzites, Schizophyllum, Xerotus, and\r\nTrogia, the plants are leathery or coriaceous, dry and tough, and though\r\nnone are recorded as poisonous, they are too tough to be edible.\r\n\r\nThe mushrooms having pink or salmon colored spores, section Rhodosporii,\r\nform the smallest of the four primary groups of Agaricini, the number of\r\nknown species not exceeding 400, and most of these are tasteless, or of\r\ndisagreeable odor, while some are recorded as unwholesome.\r\n\r\nThe species are pink-gilled when mature, though often white or whitish\r\nwhen very young.\r\n\r\nThe recorded edible species are found in Volvaria, Clitopilus, and\r\nPluteus. The Volvariae are characterized by the very large and perfect\r\nvolva which wraps the base of the stem in loose folds, the ringless\r\nstem, and the pink, soft, liquescent gills, which are free and rounded\r\nbehind. The cap is not warted; in some species it is viscid, and in\r\n_bombycinus_, recorded by several authors as edible, and by some as\r\ndoubtful, it is covered with a silky down.\r\n\r\nIn Clitopilus the odor of the edible species is more or less mealy. The\r\ncap is fleshy, and the margin at first involute. Two edible species\r\nwhich closely resemble each other--viz., Clitopilus _prunulus_, \"Plum\r\nmushroom,\" and Clitopilus _orcella_, \"Sweetbread mushroom,\"--are highly\r\nrecommended for their delicacy of flavor.\r\n\r\nIn Leptonia most of the species are small, thin, and brittle,\r\ncorresponding with Mycena in the white-spored series, and with Psathyra\r\nand Psathyrella in the dark-spored series.\r\n\r\nEccilia corresponds with Omphalia. Claudopus corresponds with Pleurotus\r\nin its habit of growth and lateral stem, differing in the color of the\r\nspores.\r\n\r\nAnnularia includes only a few small species having a ringed stem, no\r\nvolva, and free pink gills. Cooke says of this subgenus that no British\r\nspecies are known.\r\n\r\nThe recorded species of Pluteus have their habitat on tree stumps,\r\nsawdust, or upon fallen timber. One species, Pluteus _cervinus_, is\r\nrecorded as edible, but not specially commended. Of Entoloma,\r\nWorthington Smith says, \"It is allied to Tricholoma, though most of the\r\nspecies are thinner and often brittle. It agrees also in structure with\r\nHebeloma and Hypholoma.\" None of the species are recorded as having\r\nvalue as esculents.\r\n\r\nThe genus Bolbitius is described by Cooke as a small genus intermediate\r\nbetween Agaricus and Coprinus on the one side, and Coprinus and\r\nCortinarius on the other. The species are small and ephemeral. Saccardo\r\nplaces Bolbitius in his division Melanosporae, although the spores are\r\nochraceous.\r\n\r\nIn the section Pratelli Psalliota and Hypholoma contain mushrooms which\r\nare of exceptionally fine flavor. In the first of these is found the\r\ncommon field mushroom Agaricus campester and its allies.\r\n\r\nThe black-spored section Coprinarii contains two genera which include a\r\nfew recorded edible species, viz., Coprinus and Gomphidius. The\r\nPsathyrellas correspond in size to the Mycenas in the white-spored\r\nseries and to the Psathyras in the purple-spored section; the gills are\r\nfree or adnate and turn black when mature. None of the species are\r\nedible.\r\n\r\nIn Paneolus the plants are somewhat viscid when moist, the gills are\r\ndescribed as \"clouded, never becoming purple or brown.\" They are usually\r\nfound on manure heaps near cities. None are edible.\r\n\r\nSaccardo in his Sylloge combines the Pratellae and Coprinarii, making of\r\nthem one section which he calls _Melanosporeae_.\r\n\r\nG. Massee, the British mycologist, makes of the black-spored and the\r\npurple and purplish-brown spored series two divisions, calling them,\r\nrespectively, _Porphyrosporeae_ and _Melanosporeae_.\r\n\r\nThe recorded edible species of the spore section Dermini are found in\r\nPholiota, Cortinarius, and Paxillus. The larger proportion of the\r\nPholiotas grow upon tree stumps. They have a fugacious, persistent\r\nfriable ring, and are liable to be confused with the Cortinarii, unless\r\nattention is paid to the spidery veil and the iron-rust tint of the\r\nspores of the latter. Only a few of the species are recorded as edible,\r\nbut none are known to be poisonous. Cortinarius is a large genus. It\r\ncontains a larger proportion of edible species than Pholiota, and none\r\nare recorded as poisonous. The cobweb-like veil which extends from stem\r\nto margin of cap in the young species, and the rust-colored spores which\r\ndust the gills as the species mature, distinguish the genus from all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nA characteristic feature of Paxillus, and one which makes it easily\r\ndistinguishable from others of the same group, is the ease with which\r\nthe gills as a whole can be separated from the substance or fleshy\r\nportion of the cap. There is an exception to this in the species\r\nPaxillus involutus, recorded by Peck as edible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYPOREI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHymenium lining the cavity of tubes or pores which are sometimes broken\r\nup into teeth or concentric plates.--Berkeley's Outlines.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this second primary group or order of the family\r\nHymenomycetes exhibit a greater dissimilarity of form and texture than\r\ndo those of the Agaricini. Some of its genera consist almost wholly of\r\ncoriaceous or woody plants. A few contain fleshy ones. Some of the\r\nspecies have a distinct stem, while others are stemless. With regard to\r\nthe receptacle in the plants of the genera _Boletus_, _Strobilomyces_,\r\netc., it forms a perfect cap, like that of the common Agaric, a cushion\r\nof tubes taking the place of gills on the under surface of the cap, the\r\nhymenium in this case lining the inner surface of the tubes from which\r\nthe spores drop when mature.\r\n\r\nIn some species, such as those of the genus Poria, the receptacle is\r\nreduced to a single thin fibrous stratum, adhering closely to the matrix\r\nand exposing a surface of crowded pores, and in others it consists of\r\nfibrous strata formed in concentric layers.\r\n\r\nA number of groups, each of which was treated in the original Friesian\r\nclassification as a single genus, have more recently been recognized as\r\ncomprising several distinct genera. In the Saccardian system the genera\r\nTrametes, Daedalea, Merulius, Porothelium, and Fistulina still retain the\r\ngeneric rank assigned to them by Fries, but the old genus Boletus is\r\nsubdivided into four genera, Boletus, Strobilomyces, Boletinus, and\r\nGyrodon, while Polyporus, originally a very large genus, is subdivided\r\ninto the genera Polyporus, Fomes, Polystictus, and Poria. This\r\narrangement was in part suggested by Fries in his later works, and is\r\naccepted by M. C. Cooke, as indicated in his latest work on fungi.\r\n\r\nQuoting M. C. Cooke, \"_Strobilomyces_ is _Boletus_ with a rough warty\r\nand scaly pileus; _Boletinus_ is _Boletus_ with short, large radiating\r\npores; and _Gyrodon_ is _Boletus_ with elongated sinuate irregular\r\npores, all fleshy, firm fungi of robust habit, possessing stem and cap.\"\r\nThe species of the genus Polyporus as now restricted are somewhat fleshy\r\nin the young stage, shrinking as they mature and dry, and becoming\r\nindurated with age. In Fomes the species, of woody consistency from the\r\nfirst, have no room for shrinkage, and are quite rigid; the tubes being\r\nin strata, and the strata growing yearly, the species are virtually\r\nperennial. The pileus of the plant shows a rigid polished crust\r\nresulting from resinous exudations.\r\n\r\nIn Polystictus the plants are usually small, thin, tough, and irregular\r\nin outline, the tubes exceedingly short, with thin walls, which easily\r\nsplit up, giving the pores at times a toothed or fringed appearance. The\r\nsurface is velvety, or hairy, and zoned in varying colors. They are very\r\ncommon upon decaying tree stumps, often covering the surface of the\r\nstump in gaily colored layers. Not esculent.\r\n\r\nPoria is composed of resupinate species with the pores normally in a\r\nsingle series, the whole stratum spread over, and adhering to the\r\nmatrix. The species are coriaceous or woody. Not esculent.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the genus Trametes allied to Fomes are epiphytal, with the\r\ntrama the same in substance and color as the hymenophore. The tubes do\r\nnot form in regular strata, but are sunk into the substance of the\r\npileus. The plants are coriaceous, and none are edible.\r\n\r\nDaedalea closely resembles _Trametes_ with the tubes forming deep\r\nlabyrinthiform depressions. Whole plant woody, sessile.\r\n\r\nHexagonia, allied by its characteristics to Polystictus, has large\r\nhexagonal pores, with firm, entire dissepiments.\r\n\r\nIn Favolus the plants are slightly fleshy and substipitate with the\r\npores angular, and radiating from the stem. Not edible.\r\n\r\nThe species of the genus Laschia are recognized by the shallow\r\nirregular pores and the vein like character of their dissepiments (or\r\npore walls). Substance slightly gelatinous.\r\n\r\nIn the plants of Porothelium, irregular papillae take the place of tubes,\r\nand the plants are sub-membranaceous and resupinate, having the habit of\r\nthose of Poria.\r\n\r\nThe genus Merulius has been termed the lowest and most imperfect of the\r\ngenera of Polyporei. It presents a soft, waxy spore-bearing surface,\r\nreticulated with obtuse folds. Solenia, by early authors placed in\r\nDiscomycetes, thence transferred to Auricularini, and by some authors\r\nassociated with Cyphella in Theleporei, now finds place as one of the\r\ngenera of Polyporei as given by Saccardo.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned genera, together with Myriadoporus, Ceriomyces,\r\nBresadolia, Theleporus, Gloeporus, and Cyclomyces, constitute the\r\nPolyporeae of the Saccardian system.\r\n\r\n_Myriadoporus_ is a North American genus. It is a form of the genus\r\nPolyporus, but with pores in the _interior_ as well as on the _exterior_\r\nsurface. _Ceriomyces_ is generally regarded as a spurious genus. It is\r\nsimilar to _Myriadoporus_, but with internal pores and only spurious\r\npores externally. Of _Bresadolia_ Cooke says \"there is only one\r\ndescribed species, and of this only one specimen has been found.\"\r\n_Theleporus_ is an African genus of which only one species is known.\r\n_Gloeporus_ is a form of resupinate Polyporus, except that the\r\nhymenium or pore-bearing surface is gelatinous instead of being firm.\r\n_Cyclomyces_ is a genus with some features of Lenzites; it is leathery.\r\nAll of these are more or less coriaceous. None are edible. _Campbellia_\r\nis a new genus. It is _Merulius_ with a pileus and central stem.\r\n\r\nThe edible Polyporeae are found in the genera Boletus, Strobilomyces,\r\nGyrodon, Boletinus, Polyporus, and Fistulina. Of these, the first four\r\ngenera contain most of the edible species as well as a few which have\r\nbeen regarded as unwholesome or poisonous.\r\n\r\nIn the genus Polyporus as now restricted, the species Polyporus\r\n_sulphureus_ Fries is perhaps the one most likely to be selected for\r\ntable use, the others becoming very quickly indurated or tough, and this\r\nshould be gathered when very young, as in maturity it loses its fleshy\r\nconsistency and becomes dry and tough. It is common on old tree stumps\r\nand is often found on the dead wood of living trees, the bright yellow\r\nand vivid orange red tints which characterize the young plant making it\r\nvery conspicuous.\r\n\r\nIt is easily recognized by its irregular, closely overlapping frond-like\r\ncaps, white flesh, and the very small sulphur-yellow tubes. The spores\r\nare white, elliptical. The flesh of young specimens is somewhat juicy.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution is wide, and in places where a moist, warm\r\ntemperature prevails plants of this species often attain very large\r\nproportions, sometimes completely encircling the trunk of a tree at its\r\nbase. The bright colors fade as the plant matures, and the plant\r\nbecomes indurated and friable, when very old crumbling readily in the\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nTo prepare for the table, very thin slices of young specimens should be\r\ncut and either allowed to slowly simmer on the back of the range, or\r\nsoaked in milk and then fried in butter.\r\n\r\nOf the genus Fistulina but one species, Fistulina hepatica, figured in\r\nPlate X, is recorded as edible and indigenous to this country.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate X.\r\n     FISTULINA HEPATICA\r\n     1 Specimen, upper view. 2 Same, under view.\r\n     3 Specimen, upper view. 4 Same, under view.\r\n     5 Spores.\r\n     K. MAYO, del.]\r\n\r\n     PLATE X.\r\n\r\n     =Fistulina hepatica= Bull. \"_Beefsteak Mushroom_,\" \"_Liver Fungus_.\"\r\n\r\n     EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n_Genus Fistulina_ Bull. Hymenophore fleshy, hymenium inferior, that is,\r\non the under surface of the cap, at first papillose; the papillae at\r\nlength elongated, and forming distinct tubes.\r\n\r\nBesides Fistulina _hepatica_, five species of this genus are recorded in\r\nSaccardo's Sylloge, viz., F. _radicata_ Schw., F. _spathulata_ B. & C.,\r\nF. _pallida_ B. & R., F. _rosea_ Mont., and F. _antarctica_ Speg.; the\r\nlast indigenous to Patagonia.\r\n\r\nF. _hepatica_ is the only species with which I am familiar. The plants\r\nof this species are very irregular in form, rootless, epiphytal, often\r\nstemless, and sometimes attached to the matrix by a very short stem.\r\nThis fungus is frequently found upon old oak, chestnut, and ash trees,\r\ndeveloping in the rotting bark. It appears first as a rosy pimple, or in\r\na series of red granules. In a very short time it becomes tongue-shaped,\r\nsometimes kidney shaped, assuming the color of a beet root. As it\r\nincreases in size it changes form again, becoming broad in proportion to\r\nits length, and changing in color to a deep blood red, and finally to a\r\ndull liver tint. Its lower surface is often paler than its upper, it\r\nbeing tinged with yellow and pinkish hues.\r\n\r\nOne author states that it requires about two weeks to attain its highest\r\ndevelopment, after which it gradually decays.\r\n\r\nIt varies in size from a few inches to several feet in circumference.\r\nRev. M. J. Berkeley mentions one which weighed thirty pounds. It has\r\nbeen styled, the \"_poor man's fungus_,\" and in flavor resembles meat\r\nmore than any other.\r\n\r\nThe substance is fleshy and juicy in the early stage. The pileus is\r\npapillose, the papillae elongated, and forming distinct tubes as the\r\npileus expands. These tubes are separable from each other, and with age\r\nbecome approximate and jagged at their orifices. The tubes are at first\r\nyellowish, with a pink tinge, becoming dingy with age. The fleshy\r\nsubstance, or hymenophore, is often veined in light and dark red\r\nstreaks. The juice is pellucid, red, and slightly acid. Spores at first\r\nnearly round, becoming elliptical, salmon color.\r\n\r\nThis fungus is esteemed in Europe, where it is eaten prepared in a\r\nvariety of ways.\r\n\r\nWhen young and tender it can be sliced and broiled or minced and stewed,\r\nmaking a delicious dish. When too old the stock is rather tough for good\r\neating, but the gravy taken from it forms a rich flavoring for a\r\nvegetable stew or a meat ragout. The following recipe for cooking this\r\nmushroom has been recommended:\r\n\r\n    Slice and macerate it, add pepper and salt, a little lemon, and\r\n    chopped onions or garlic; then strain and boil the liquid, which\r\n    makes most excellent gravy, resembling that of good beefsteak.\r\n\r\nThe Fistulina hepatica is well known in Europe, and is found in\r\ndifferent parts of the United States, in some places growing abundantly.\r\nI have gathered some fine specimens in Maryland and Virginia, but none\r\nas large as that described by Dr. Berkeley.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES FOR COOKING MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Pot Mushrooms._--The small open mushrooms suit best for potting.\r\nTrim and rub them; put into a stewpan a quart of mushrooms, 3 ounces of\r\nbutter, 2 teaspoonfuls of salt, and half a teaspoonful of cayenne and\r\nmace, mixed, and stew for ten or fifteen minutes, or till the mushrooms\r\nare tender; take them carefully out and drain them perfectly on a\r\nsloping dish, and when cold press them into small pots and pour\r\nclarified butter over them, in which state they will keep for a week or\r\ntwo. Writing-paper placed over the butter, and over that melted suet,\r\nwill effectually preserve them for weeks in a dry, cool place.\r\n\r\n_To Pickle Mushrooms._--Select a number of sound, small pasture\r\nmushrooms, as nearly alike as possible in size. Throw them for a few\r\nminutes into cold water, then drain them, cut off the stalks, and gently\r\nrub off the outer skin with a moist flannel dipped in salt; then boil\r\nthe vinegar, adding to each quart two ounces of salt, half a nutmeg\r\ngrated, a dram of mace, and an ounce of white pepper corns. Put the\r\nmushrooms into the vinegar for ten minutes over the fire; then pour the\r\nwhole into small jars, taking care that the spices are equally divided;\r\nlet them stand a day, then cover them.\r\n\r\n_Baked Mushrooms._--Peel the tops of twenty mushrooms; cut off a portion\r\nof the stalks and wipe them carefully with a piece of flannel dipped in\r\nsalt. Lay the mushrooms in a tin dish, put a small piece of butter on\r\nthe top of each, and season with pepper and salt. Set the dish in the\r\noven and bake them from twenty minutes to half an hour. When done,\r\narrange them high in the centre of a very hot dish, pour the sauce\r\naround them, and serve quickly and as hot as you possibly can.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms with Bacon._--Take some full-grown mushrooms, and, having\r\ncleaned them, procure a few rashers of nice streaky bacon and fry them\r\nin the usual manner. When nearly done add a dozen or so of mushrooms\r\nand fry them slowly until they are cooked. In this process they will\r\nabsorb all the fat of the bacon, and with the addition of a little salt\r\nand pepper will form a most appetizing breakfast relish.\r\n\r\n_Mushroom Pie._--A very good mushroom pie is made in the following\r\nmanner: Chop a quart of mushrooms into small pieces, season to taste,\r\nand add one pound of round steak chopped fine and seasoned with a small\r\npiece of onion. If the steak is lean, add a small piece of suet, unless\r\nbutter is preferred to give flavor. Put the chopped steak and mushrooms\r\nin deep saucepan with cover, and stew slowly until tender. Make a crust\r\nas for beefsteak pie and put in a deep earthern dish, lightly browning\r\nthe under crust before adding the stew, and cover with a crust lightly\r\npunctured.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Russia mushrooms form an important part of the diet of\r\nthe people, especially during the Lenten season, when the fast of the\r\nGreek church is very strictly kept, and meat, fish, eggs, and butter are\r\nforbidden.\r\n\r\nProvision is made for this season in the securing of quantities of dried\r\nand salted mushrooms, which are cut up in strips and made into salads\r\nwith a dressing of olive oil and vinegar. The poorer classes to whom the\r\nolive oil is unattainable use the rape seed and other vegetable oils in\r\nthe cooking of their mushrooms.\r\n\r\nThe following recipes are translated from a recently published Russian\r\nwork on the subject of mushrooms, cultivated and wild:\r\n\r\nSelect fresh, sound Boleti, cut off the caps, and, after wiping clean\r\nwith a napkin, place them in a sieve, pouring over them scalding water;\r\nwhen thoroughly drained, leave them where there is a free current of air\r\nuntil perfectly dry. Next string them upon stout twine, leaving spaces\r\nbetween to allow of free circulation of air. If convenient, they can be\r\ndried artificially by placing in a not too hot oven with the door open.\r\nDried by either method, they can be kept all winter. Before using, they\r\nshould be soaked in water or milk until soft. In this condition they\r\nmake very good flavoring for soup or gravy, and can also be used as\r\nfilling for pies.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms Cooked in Butter._--Wipe the mushrooms clean and dip in dry\r\nflour. Heat a quantity of butter to boiling temperature in a saucepan,\r\nseasoning with a small piece of onion. Drop the flour-covered mushrooms\r\ninto the boiling butter, shaking the pan constantly over the fire. When\r\nthe mushrooms are cooked add sour cream to taste. Before serving,\r\nsprinkle with grated muscat nut.\r\n\r\n_Mushroom Pickle._--Select only young button mushrooms. Put them for a\r\nfew moments in boiling water lightly salted and vinegared. Boil vinegar\r\n(only the best should be used), spicing it according to taste. Allow the\r\nvinegar to cool. Put the mushrooms in layers in a jar and pour over them\r\nenough spiced vinegar to cover. Seal tightly.\r\n\r\n_Salted Piperites._--Only the caps are taken of the Lactarius piperites.\r\nThey are placed first in salted scalding water for several minutes. The\r\nwater is then gently pressed out with a napkin, the mushrooms are\r\nplaced on sieves and cold water poured over them. They are then placed\r\nin layers in a jar, each layer sprinkled with salt, and whole pepper and\r\nminced onion scattered over the layer. When the jar is full a thin round\r\nboard is placed upon the top layer and pressed down with weights, and as\r\nthe mass gives way mushrooms are added until the jar is compactly\r\nfilled. The jar is then covered with parchment or otherwise tightly\r\nsealed. Eight gallons of mushrooms require from one to one and a half\r\nglasses of salt. This makes a good salad when treated with oil.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--L. piperites is an extremely acrid mushroom when in the raw\r\nstate, and the Russians do not stew it, but prepare it in the above way,\r\ntaking the precaution to scald thoroughly with salted water before\r\nputting away. The precaution of scalding through several waters is a\r\nwise one to use in the preparation of all mushrooms inasmuch as the\r\npoisonous principle of most mushrooms is soluble in scalding water.\r\nDilute vinegar is frequently used in the same manner. Vinegar should not\r\nbe used in metal vessels unless porcelain-lined.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF THE GENERA OF HYMENOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following list of the genera of Hymenomycetes, summarized from\r\nKellerman's Synopsis of Saccardo's Sylloge Fungorum, will be found\r\nuseful for reference:\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--AGARICACEAE.\r\n\r\n_Leucosporeae._ (Spores white or slightly tinted yellowish.)\r\n\r\n    GENERA.\r\n\r\n    Amanita Pers.\r\n    Amanitopsis Roze.\r\n    Lepiota Fries.\r\n    Schulzeria Bres.\r\n    Armillaria Fries.\r\n    Tricholoma Fries.\r\n    Clitocybe Fries.\r\n    Collybia Fries.\r\n    Mycena Fries.\r\n    Hiatula Fries.\r\n    Omphalia Fries.\r\n    Pleurotus Fries.\r\n    Hygrophorus Fries.\r\n    Lactarius Fries.\r\n    Russula Pers.\r\n    Cantharellus Adans.\r\n    Arrhenia Fries.\r\n    Nyctalis Fries.\r\n    Stylobates Fries.\r\n    Marasmius Fries.\r\n    Heliomyces Lev.\r\n    Lentinus Fries.\r\n    Panus Fries.\r\n    Xerotus Fries.\r\n    Trogia Fries.\r\n    Lenzites Fries.\r\n    Tilotus Kalch.\r\n    Hymenogramme B. & Mont.\r\n    Oudemansiella Speg.\r\n    Pterophyllus Lev.\r\n    Rachophyllus Berk.\r\n    Schizophyllum Fries.\r\n\r\n_Rhodosporae_ (spores pink or salmon color), corresponding to the\r\nHyporhodii of Fries.\r\n\r\n    GENERA.\r\n\r\n    Volvaria Fr.\r\n    Annularia Schulz.\r\n    Pluteus Fries.\r\n    Entoloma Fries.\r\n    Clitopilus Fries.\r\n    Leptonia Fries.\r\n    Nolanea Fries.\r\n    Eccilia Fries.\r\n    Claudopus Worth.

Dr. Brefield's exhaustive investigations into\r\nthe life-history of fungi in general have been such as to entitle his\r\nviews to consideration, although the system presents some\r\ninconsistencies which may prevent its adoption in its entirety.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Brefield system, as summarized by his colleague Dr. Von\r\nTavel, Fungi are divided into two primary classes: (1) the\r\n_Phycomycetes,_ or lower fungi nearest like the algae, _consisting of a\r\none-celled thallus with sexual as well as non-sexual modes of\r\nreproduction_, and (2) the Mesomycetes and the Mycomycetes, _having a\r\ndivided or many celled thallus, propagated by non-sexually formed\r\nspores_. The Phycomycetes are further divided into two large sections,\r\nbased on their methods of reproduction, termed, respectively,\r\nZygomycetes and Oomycetes. These include the old typical Mucors, the\r\nPeronosporeae or \"rotting moulds,\" once classed with the Hyphomycetes,\r\nthe Saprolegniaceae, \"Fish Moulds,\" of aquatic habit, the\r\nEntomophthoraceae, \"Insect Moulds,\" together with some minor groups. The\r\nMesomycetes connect the Phycomycetes with the Mycomycetes. The class\r\nMycomycetes is primarily divided into two sections, viz., Ascomycetes\r\nand Basidiomycetes, with the Ustilagineae, \"Smut Fungi,\" in Mesomycetes,\r\nforming a transitional group between Phycomycetes and the Basidiomycetal\r\ngroup of the higher fungi.\r\n\r\nThe Ascomycetes are primarily subdivided into _Exoasci_ and _Carpoasci,_\r\ngroups based on the character of the asci. In the first, _Exoasci,_ the\r\nasci are naked and borne directly on the mycelium; in the second,\r\n_Carpoasci,_ they are enclosed in a wrapper composed of fertile hyphae\r\nand sterile threads, having also accessory fruit forms. The first\r\nincludes Endomycetes and Taphrineae. In the second are included the\r\ngroups Gymnoasci, Perisporaceae, Pyrenomycetes, Hysteriaceae,\r\nDiscomycetes, and Helvellaceae.\r\n\r\nThe Basidiomycetes characterized by the possession of basidia are\r\narranged in two groups, based on the character of the basidia: (1) the\r\nProtobasidiomycetes, in which the basidia are septate, divided, and (2)\r\nthe Autobasidiomycetes, in which the basidia are not divided, and bear a\r\ndefinite number of spores.\r\n\r\nThe first of these (Protobasidiomycetes) includes the following distinct\r\ngroups: (1) the Uredineae, \"Rust Fungi,\" which have horizontally divided\r\nbasidia, always free, never enclosed; (2) the Auricularieae, having\r\nbasidia somewhat resembling those of the Uredineae, but which are borne\r\nin fruit bodies with open hymenia; (3) Pileacreae, having horizontal\r\nseptate basidia in closed receptacles; and (4) Tremellineae, having\r\nvertically divided basidia borne in gymnocarpous receptacles--that is,\r\nthose in which the hymenium is exposed while the spores are growing.\r\n\r\nThe Autobasidiomycetes are characterized by undivided basidia, bearing\r\nspores only at the apex. This group is subdivided into three sections:\r\n(1) Dacryomycetes, which includes the lowest of the Tremelloid forms,\r\nwith club-shaped basidia, nearly approaching the true Hymenomycetal\r\ntype, together with several groups of minor import; (2) Gasteromycetes;\r\nand (3) Hymenomycetes, with Phalloideae placed in the group as a\r\nsubsection of Gasteromycetes.\r\n\r\nThe above can only be considered as a very brief abstract of the system\r\nof classification proposed by Dr. Brefield, but it will serve to give\r\nsome idea of the principle on which the system is based, which is\r\nsufficient for our present purpose. Those who wish to study the system\r\nin detail will find it treated in a comprehensive manner in Dr. Von\r\nTavel's summary as it appears in the _Vergleichende Morphologie der\r\nPilze_, Jena, 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONIOMYCETES AND HYPHOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the original classification of Fries two of the primary divisions of\r\nthe sporiferous Fungi were termed, respectively, _Coniomycetes_ and\r\n_Hyphomycetes_. This arrangement was accepted by Berkeley, the term\r\n_Coniomycetes_ being applied to all fungi in which the naked spores,\r\nappearing like an impalpable dust, were the principal feature of the\r\nplant, and the term _Hyphomycetes_ to fungi in which the threads or\r\nhyphae bearing the spores were the most conspicuous feature.\r\n\r\nConiomycetes, as broadly interpreted by Berkeley and other mycologists\r\nof his day, included the Uredineae or \"rust fungi,\" the Ustilagines or\r\n\"smut fungi,\" the Sphaeropsideae, and the Melanconieae. This arrangement\r\nwas very unsatisfactory on account of the distinctively different\r\ncharacter of the methods of reproduction of the respective groups, and\r\nthey have since been disassociated and by some authors ranked as\r\ndistinct orders or families. Others combine Uredinei and Ustilaginei in\r\none group under the name Hypodermei.\r\n\r\nFamiliar examples of Uredinei are seen in the rust of the Barberry leaf,\r\netc., and of the Ustilaginei in the \"smut\" of corn and the \"bunt\" of\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\nSome authors combine the Sphaeropsideae with the closely allied\r\nMelanconieae. M. C. Cooke contends that the _Sphaeropsideae_ should be\r\nconsidered apart from the _Melanconieae,_ on the fundamental basis that\r\nthe former possess a distinct perithecium, while the latter do not.\r\n\r\nThe _Sphaeropsideae_ as recently defined by Cooke are \"Fungi _possessed of\r\na perithecium, but without asci_, ... sporules or stylospores being\r\nproduced internally at the apex of more or less distinct supporting\r\nhyphae or pedicels, termed sporophores.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sphaeropsideae somewhat resemble the Pyrenomyceteae in external\r\ncharacteristics, but differ from them in the absence of asci and\r\nparaphyses. Saccardo retains all the species in his Sylloge, but\r\nrelegates them to an inferior position as imperfect fungi.\r\n\r\nThe group _Pyrenomycetes_, or _Sphaeriacei_, as at first recognized by\r\n_Fries_, included not only the _Sphaeriacei_ and the _Perisporacei_, but\r\nalso the _Sphaeropsidei_ and _Melanconiaceae_. Later, when ascigerous\r\nfungi were separated from stylosporous fungi, this group was revised,\r\nthe ascigerous species only being retained. As at present limited, the\r\nPyrenomycetes are \"_ascigerous_ fungi having the fructification enclosed\r\nwithin a perithecium.\"\r\n\r\nThey constitute a very large group, the described species, according to\r\nCooke's Census of Fungi, numbering not less than 10,500, or at least\r\n1,000 more than all the recorded species of Hymenomycetes. The plants\r\nare microscopic in size, and grow upon vegetable or animal substances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPHOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the Hyphomycetes, Cooke takes the ground that in their\r\ninternal relations to each other, and their external relations to the\r\nremaining orders, the Hyphomycetes are undoubtedly a well-defined and\r\nnatural group, and should have place as such in a systematic work. It is\r\na large order, containing nearly 5,000 species, mostly parasitic on dead\r\nanimals and vegetable matter. The spores, termed conidia, are free, as\r\nin Hymenomycetes. The species are microscopic in size, and the hyphae are\r\nstrongly developed. They have no hymenium and no true basidia, and are\r\nnon-sexual in their reproduction.\r\n\r\nThe four primary sections are the Mucedineae, or \"white moulds;\" the\r\nDematieae, or \"black moulds;\" the Stilbea, with the hyphae or thread-like\r\nfilaments pallid or brown, and densely cohering, and the Tubercularieae,\r\nwith the hyphae densely compacted in wart-like pustules of somewhat\r\ngelatinous consistency.\r\n\r\nThe divisions called Melanconieae, Sphaeropsideae, and Hyphomyceteae are not\r\nrecognized in the Brefield system of classification as distinct groups.\r\nMassee and Cooke, with other mycologists, take exception to this\r\nomission and its implication, in their discussion of the subject, giving\r\nconsistent reasons for the retention of these groups in systematic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYCOMYCETES OR PHYSOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs originally defined by Berkeley, this group was composed chiefly of\r\nthe old typical Mucors and their allies, and was then termed\r\nPhysomycetes. In the newer system of classification its original\r\ndefinition has been extended so as to include a number of groups\r\nsomewhat dissimilar in their habits and characteristics, but \"united\r\nunder the conservating bond of a dimorphic reproduction,\" and the name\r\nhas been changed to Phycomycetes. As at present recognized \"the\r\nPhycomycetes are characterized by a unicellular mycelium, often\r\nparasitic on plants or animals, sometimes saprophytic, developed in the\r\nair or in water. Reproduction sexual or asexual.\" As thus interpreted,\r\nPhycomycetes includes the Mucoracei; the Peronosporaceae, or \"rotting\r\nmoulds;\" the Cystopi, or \"white rusts;\" the Saprolegniaceae, or \"fish\r\nmoulds;\" the Entomophthoraceae, or \"insect moulds,\" together with a few\r\nminor groups of doubtful natural affinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaccardo, P.

Saccardo, in defining the terms which he employs, accepts\r\nthe term spores as applicable exclusively to the naked spores supported\r\non basidia, as found in the Basidiomyceteae. The term sporidia he limits\r\nto spores produced or enclosed in an ascus, as in the Ascomyceteae. The\r\nterm sporules he applies to the spores of imperfect fungi, where they\r\nare enclosed in perithecia (microscopic cups or cells), such as the\r\nSphaeropsidea. The term conidia he uses to designate the spores of\r\nimperfect fungi without perithecia or asci, such as the Hyphomyceteae and\r\nthe Melanconieae. This arrangement is in accordance with M. C. Cooke's\r\npublished views on the subject, except in the case of the spore bodies\r\nof the Melanconieae, which he prefers, for well-defined reasons, to call\r\nsporules.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these limitations, the terms _spermatia_,\r\n_stylospores_, and _clinospores_ are merged in _sporule_.\r\n\r\nOther terms appropriate to their development are employed to designate\r\nthe spores of Uredineae, Phycomyceteae, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           STUDENT'S HAND-BOOK\r\n                                   OF\r\n                          MUSHROOMS OF AMERICA\r\n\r\n                          EDIBLE AND POISONOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   BY\r\n                          THOMAS TAYLOR, M.

Taylor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGASTEROMYCETES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHymenium more or less permanently concealed, consisting in most cases of\r\nclosely packed cells of which the fertile ones (the basidia) bear naked\r\nspores on distinct spicules, exposed only by the rupture or decay of the\r\ninvesting coat or peridium. Berkeley's Outlines.\r\n\r\nThis family has been subjected to numerous revisions since the days of\r\nFries, when its structural characteristics were not so well understood\r\nas at present.\r\n\r\nMontagne and Berkeley are credited with being the first to show the true\r\nstructure of the hymenium in the puff-balls, as well as to demonstrate\r\nthe presence of basidia. This important discovery led to the correlating\r\nof the Gasteromycetes with the Hymenomycetes under the common title\r\nBasidiomycetes, both having the spores borne upon basidia. The two\r\nfamilies still remained distinct, however, not only because of the\r\ndissimilarity in their external features but principally on account of\r\nthe difference in the disposition and character of the hymenium.\r\n\r\nIn the Hymenomycetes the hymenium is exposed to the light from the\r\nfirst, and the spores drop from the basidia as they mature; whereas in\r\nthe Gasteromycetes the hymenial pulp, or gleba, consisting of the spores\r\nwith the supporting basidia and the hyphae, is enclosed within the\r\nsubstance of the fungus, and the spores are exposed only on the decay of\r\nthe investing coat.\r\n\r\nThe basidia of the Gasteromycetes, though resembling those of the\r\nHymenomycetes, are more variable in form and the number of the spores\r\nnot so constant. They perform the same functions and bear spicules,\r\nsometimes in pairs, sometimes quaternate, each spicule being surmounted\r\nby a spore. They dissolve away as the spores mature and can, therefore,\r\nonly be observed in the very young stage of the plant. The spores of the\r\nGasteromycetes are usually colored and, except in the subterranean\r\nspecies, globose. As seen through the microscope they have often a rough\r\nwarty appearance, sometimes spinulose. Paraphyses may be present as\r\naborted basidia, but cystidia are rarely distinguished. A characteristic\r\nof a large proportion of the plants is the drying up of the hymenial\r\nsubstance, so that the cavity of the receptacle becomes at length filled\r\nwith a dusty mass composed of spores and delicate threads, the remains\r\nof the shriveled hyphae.\r\n\r\nThe following table will serve to show the distinctive features of the\r\nfour primary divisions of the Gasteromycetes:\r\n\r\n    _Lycoperdaceae_.--Hymenium fugitive, drying in a dusty mass of\r\n    threads and spores, dispersed by an opening or by fissures of the\r\n    peridium. Terrestrial.\r\n\r\n    _Phalloideae_.--Hymenium deliquescent and slimy; receptacle pileate;\r\n    volva universal. Foetid fleshy fungi.\r\n\r\n    _Hypogaei_, or _Hymenogastreae_.--Hymenium permanent, not becoming\r\n    dusty or deliquescent except when decayed. Capillitium wanting.\r\n    Subterranean.\r\n\r\n    _Nidulariaceae_.--Receptacle cup-shaped or globose; spores produced\r\n    on sporophores or short basidia enclosed in globose or disciform\r\n    bodies (sporangia) contained within a distinct peridium.\r\n    Terrestrial.\r\n\r\nThe section Lycoperdaceae contains upwards of 500 species or more than\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole number of recorded species of the\r\nGasteromycetes. Lycoperdon, Bovista, and Geaster, its most conspicuous\r\ngenera, are said to contain the largest number of well-known species. A\r\nfew are edible.\r\n\r\nThe Phalloideae include about 90 species. The plants are usually\r\nill-smelling and unwholesome. Some are stipitate, others are latticed,\r\netc. Some are conspicuous for their bright coloring. In the young stage\r\nthey are enclosed in an egg-shaped volva having a gelatinous inner\r\nstratum.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the Nidulariaceae are very minute, tough, and widely\r\ndistributed. The species Cyathus, the \"bird's-nest fungus,\" is quite\r\ncommon in some localities, and is interesting because of its peculiar\r\nform. The individual plant is very small, not more than two centimeters\r\nhigh. It resembles an inverted bell, or a miniature wine-glass. A\r\ndelicate white membrane covers the top at first. This disappears as the\r\nplant matures, revealing lentil-shaped bodies packed closely together\r\nlike eggs in a nest. These oval bodies are the peridiola containing the\r\nspores. They are usually found upon rotten wood or sticks on the ground.\r\nSixty-five species are recorded, but none are edible.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the division Hypogaei or Hymenogastreae are subterranean in\r\nhabit, preferring a sandy soil. They are usually somewhat globose in\r\nform, having a thick outer coat or peridium, though in some of the\r\ngenera the outer coat is very thin or obsolete. They are dingy in color.\r\nIn the young plants the interior substance somewhat resembles that of\r\nthe truffle, but is streaked and mottled. When old the gleba consists of\r\na dusty mass of threads and spores. They are known under various\r\nappellations, such as \"underground puff-balls,\" \"false truffles,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe Hypogaei are analogous to the Tuberacei, except that the spores are\r\nnot contained in asci as in the latter. Cooke says they appear to be the\r\nlink which unites the Basidiomycetes to the Ascomycetes by means of the\r\nTuberacei or genuine Truffles. In the young stage the basidia in the\r\nHypogaei are easily distinguished by the aid of the microscope.\r\n\r\nIn external features and habit of growth the species of Elaphomyces, a\r\ngenus of Tuberacei, closely resemble the Hypogaei, and in old age, when\r\nthe _asci_ have disappeared, it is difficult to distinguish the plants\r\nof this genus from the Hypogaei.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Melanogaster_ contains an edible species, _M. variegatus_,\r\nTulasne, commonly known in Europe as the \"Red Truffle\" or \"False\r\nTruffle.\" _M. variegatus_ is usually gregarious and subterranean in\r\nhabit. The exterior is minutely granular, tawny yellow or reddish rust\r\ncolor; the interior soft, bluish-black, streaked with yellow, the spore\r\nmass in maturity becoming pubescent. The odor is pleasantly aromatic,\r\nand the taste sweet. Under trees in woods. The variety _Broomeianus_\r\nBerk. is paler in the marbling, which shows reddish instead of yellow\r\nstreaks. The pulpy mass is at first white, changing to a yellowish,\r\nsmoky hue.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYCOPERDACEAE AND PHALLOIDEAE.\r\n\r\nThe plants figured in Plates G and H belong to the Lycoperdaceae and\r\nPhalloideae.\r\n\r\n\r\nLYCOPERDACEAE.\r\n\r\nMassee, who has given the Puff-Ball group very close study, says that in\r\nthe gleba of the Lycoperdaceae, \"at a very early period two sets of hyphae\r\nare present. One, thin-walled, colorless, septate and rich in\r\nprotoplasm, gives origin to the trama, and elements of the hymenium, and\r\nusually disappears entirely after the formation of the spores; the\r\nsecond type consists of long thick-walled aseptate or sparsely septate,\r\noften colored hyphae, which are persistent and form the capillitium. The\r\nlatter are branches of the hyphae forming the hymenium.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERA LYCOPERDON AND BOVISTA.\r\n\r\nTo the genera Lycoperdon and Bovista belong most of the \"Puff-balls\" and\r\nall of the species figured in Plate G. In the plants of these two genera\r\nthe peridium is more or less distinctly double, and the hyphae, or\r\ndelicate threads which are seen mixed with the dusty mass of spores in\r\nthe mature plant, forming what is called the capillitium, are an\r\nimportant element in classification.\r\n\r\n_Genus Lycoperdon_ Tourn. In this genus the investing coat or peridium\r\nis membranaceous, vanishing above or becoming flaccid; bark or outer\r\nshell adnate, sub-persistent, breaking up into scales or warts;\r\ncapillitium soft, dense, and attached to the peridium, base spongy and\r\nsterile.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate G.\r\n     Gasteromycetes.\r\n     Six Types of the \"Puff-Ball\" Group.\r\n     Edible.]\r\n\r\n     PLATE G.\r\n\r\n     EDIBLE PUFF-BALLS.\r\n\r\n     FIG. 1.--=Lycoperdon caelatum= Fries. \"_Collapsing Puff-Ball_.\"\r\n\r\nPeridium flaccid above, with mealy coating, obtuse, at length\r\ncollapsing, the sterile stratum cellulose.

Edible when young, but not much\r\ncommended. Plant pale cream color.\r\n\r\n     FIGS. 2 and 3.--=Lycoperdon gemmatum= Batsch. \"_Warted Puff-Ball_,\"\r\n     \"_Studded Puff-Ball_.\"\r\n\r\nPlant sub-globular, with a stem-like base; white or cinereous, turning\r\nto light greyish-brown, the surface warty, the warts unequal, the larger\r\nones somewhat pointed, the smaller granular. As the warts fall off they\r\nleave the surface of the denuded peridium somewhat dotted or slightly\r\nreticulated. Flesh, when young, firm and whitish. The plants of this\r\nspecies are small, variable in form, sometimes turbinated, sometimes\r\nnearly globose, or depressed globose, but usually the basal portion is\r\nnarrower than the upper portion. The stem varies in thickness and\r\nlength; sometimes it is quite elongated, in some instances absent.\r\nCapillitium and spores yellowish-green, turning dark olive or brown.\r\nColumella present. When the spores are fully ripe the peridium opens by\r\na small apical aperture for their dispersion. The plants are sometimes\r\ndensely caespitose, and crowd together on the ground or on decaying wood\r\nin large patches after warm rains. They are found both in fields and\r\nopen woods during summer and autumn. They are edible when young, but not\r\nspecially well flavored. There are several varieties. Plants sometimes\r\noval or lens-shaped.\r\n\r\nIn Var. _hirtum_ the plant is turbinate, subsessile, and hairy, with\r\nslender, spinous warts. The variety _papulatum_ is subrotund, sessile,\r\npapillose and pulverulent, the warts being nearly uniform in size.\r\nPlants from one to two inches in height.\r\n\r\n     FIGS. 4 and 5.--=Lycoperdon pyriforme= Schaeffer. \"_Pear-Shaped\r\n     Puff-Ball_.\"\r\n\r\nPlant dingy white or brownish yellow; pear-shaped, or obovate pyriforme,\r\nsometimes approaching L. gemmatum in size and shape, but easily\r\ndistinguished from that species by the surface features of the peridium\r\nand the internal hyphae. The persistent warts which cover the surface of\r\nthe peridium are so minute as to appear to the naked eye like scales. In\r\nsome instances the peridium is almost smooth, and sometimes cracks in\r\nareas, inner peridium thin and tough. The hyphae are thicker than the\r\nspores and branched, continuous with the slightly cellular base, and\r\nforming a columella inside the peridium. Spores greenish-yellow, then\r\nbrownish-olive, smooth and globose.\r\n\r\nThe short stem-like base of the plant terminates in fiber-like rootlets,\r\ncreeping under the soil and branching, thus attaching large clusters of\r\nthe young plants together. They are often found in quantity on the mossy\r\ntrunks of fallen trees.\r\n\r\n     FIG. 6.--=Lycoperdon giganteum= Batsch. \"_Giant Puff-Ball_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Giant Puff-Ball, so generally neglected, is one of the most valuable\r\nof the edible mushrooms. It is readily distinguished from other\r\npuff-balls and allied fungi by its large size. It is subglobose in form,\r\noften flattened at the top and usually wider than deep. The peridium or\r\nrind is membranaceous, smooth, or very slightly floccose, and creamy\r\nwhite at first, turning to pale yellowish-brown when the plant is old.\r\nWhen young it is filled with a white, seemingly homogeneous fleshy\r\nsubstance of pleasant flavor. This substance changes, when mature, to an\r\nelastic, yellowish or olivaceous brown, cottony but dusty mass of\r\nfilaments and spores. The peridium is very fragile above, cracking into\r\nareae in the mature plant and breaking up and falling away in fragments,\r\nthus allowing the dispersion of the spores. The capillitium and spores\r\nare at first greenish-yellow, turning to dingy olive. The plants vary in\r\nsize, but average from ten to twenty inches in diameter. In the columns\r\nof the _Country Gentleman_ some years ago there appeared a description\r\nof a puff-ball of this species which weighed forty seven pounds and\r\nmeasured a little over eight feet in circumference. It was found in a\r\nlow, moist corner of a public park. Specimens weighing from twenty to\r\nthirty pounds are recorded as being found in different parts of the\r\ncountry; but specimens of such large dimensions are unusual. This\r\nspecies is found in many parts of the United States. It is the L.\r\n_bovista_ of Linn. Sacc.\r\n\r\nA correspondent writes that he has found the giant puff-ball in great\r\nabundance growing on the Genessee Flats, Livingstone Co., New York.\r\nAnother writes from Nebraska that it is quite abundant on the prairies\r\nthere in summer. A third writes from Missouri, \"Since the late rains we\r\nhave had puff-balls in abundance, and find them delicious made into\r\nfritters.\"\r\n\r\nThe puff-balls should be gathered young. If the substance within is\r\nwhite and pulpy, it is in good condition for cooking, but if marked with\r\nyellow stains it should be rejected.\r\n\r\nVittadini says:\r\n\r\n\"When the giant puff-ball is conveniently situated you should only take\r\none slice at a time, cutting it horizontally and using great care not to\r\ndisturb its growth, to prevent decay, and thus one may have a fritter\r\nevery day for a week.\"\r\n\r\nDifferent authors write with enthusiasm of the merits of the giant\r\npuff-ball as an esculent.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hussey, an English botanist, gives the following receipt for\r\n\"puff-ball omelet:\"\r\n\r\nFirst, remove the outer skin; cut in slices half an inch thick; have\r\nready some chopped herbs, pepper, and salt; dip the slices in the yolk\r\nof an egg, and sprinkle the herbs upon them; fry in fresh butter, and\r\neat immediately.\r\n\r\nI have tested fine specimens of the giant puff-ball gathered in the\r\npublic parks of Washington, D. C., finding it delicious eating when\r\nfried in batter.\r\n\r\n     FIGS. 7 and 8.--=Lycoperdon cyathiforme= Bose. \"_Cup-shaped\r\n     Puff-Ball_.\"\r\n\r\nSynonyms--L. fragile Vitt. L. albopurpureum Frost.\r\n\r\nPlant nearly globose, with a short, thick, stem-like base, color\r\nvarying, cinereous, brown, tinged with violet.\r\n\r\nRind or peridium smooth, or minutely floccose, scaly in the mature\r\nplant, cracking into somewhat angular areas, the upper portion finally\r\nfalling away in fragments, leaving a wide cup-shaped base, with\r\nirregular margin, which remains long after the dispersion of the spores\r\nand capillitium. This basal portion is often tinged with the purplish\r\nhue of the spores. Spores rough, purplish-brown. Capillitium same color\r\nas the spores.\r\n\r\nLycoperdon _cyathiforme_ is a more common species than L. _giganteum_,\r\nand is deemed quite equal to the latter in flavor. The plants are of\r\ngood size, being from 4 to 10 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThey are frequently found in open fields and grassy places after\r\nelectric storms. When sliced and fried in egg batter, they taste much\r\nlike the _giganteum_ or _giant puff-ball_.\r\n\r\nA puff-ball which is not inferior to either of the two last-named\r\nspecies, though not as large, and perhaps not as abundant as either, is\r\nthe Lycoperdon _saccatum_ of Fries, sometimes called the \"Long-stemmed\r\npuff-ball,\" because of its elongated stem.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this species are attractive in appearance, usually\r\nhemispherical, or lentiform in shape, with cylindrical stem-like base.\r\nThe peridium is thin and delicate, breaking into fragments; creamy white\r\nin the young stage, and clothed with delicate warts, so minute as to\r\ngive the surface a soft mealy appearance, the under surface somewhat\r\nplicate. Capillitium sub-persistent and dense. Both spores and\r\ncapillitium brown.\r\n\r\n     LYCOPERDACEAE.\r\n\r\n_Genus Bovista_ Dill. Peridium papery (or sometimes corky), persistent;\r\nthe outer rind, sometimes called the bark, quite distinct from the\r\ninner, at length shelling off. Capillitium sub-compact, equal, adnate to\r\nthe peridium on all sides; spores pedicillate, brownish.\r\n\r\n     FIGS. 9 and 10.--=Bovista plumbea= Pers. _Lead-Colored Bovista_.\r\n\r\nPlant small, spherical, having a double shell or peridium, the inner one\r\nwhite and the outer one smooth and greyish lead-color or bluish-grey,\r\nand shelling off at maturity. When young the interior is filled with a\r\ncreamy white substance. This soon begins to disintegrate, and, as the\r\nspores mature, changes to a mass of dusty brown spores and threads. When\r\nthe spores are ready for dissemination a small aperture appears in the\r\ntop of the peridium, through which they push their way outwards like a\r\nlittle puff of smoke.\r\n\r\nWhen young, and while the flesh is white throughout, the plant is\r\nedible, although so small that it would take a quantity to make a good\r\ndish. It is found chiefly in pastures in the autumn. Sometimes found\r\ngrowing in company with Agaricus campestris. Of pleasant flavor when\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 11. Basidium and spores of a Lycoperdon highly magnified.\r\n\r\nAn English author states that inflammation of the throat and swelling of\r\nthe tongue have been known to ensue from eating some of the small\r\nspecies of Lycoperdon in the raw state. It would be a wise precaution,\r\ntherefore, to cook all of the smaller species well before eating.\r\n\r\nThe genus Scleroderma is allied to Lycoperdon, but differs from it in\r\nthe absence of a capillitium, and in the thick indehiscent outer skin,\r\nor peridium, which bursts irregularly on the maturity of the spore-mass,\r\nthe flocci adhering on all sides to the peridium and forming distinct\r\nveins in the central mass.\r\n\r\nThe species Scleroderma _vulgare_ is very common in woods, and has\r\nsometimes been mistaken for a form of Truffle. The plants are not very\r\nattractive, and the odor is rank. They are subsessile and irregular in\r\nshape, with a hard outer skin, the larger form of a yellowish or\r\ngreenish brown hue, and covered with large warts or scales, the smaller\r\nvery minutely warty, and of a darker brown hue. The internal mass is of\r\na bluish-black hue, threaded through with white or greyish flocci.\r\nSpores dingy. The interior becomes pulverulent when the plant matures.\r\nThis species has been eaten in its young state when cooked, but the\r\nflavor is by no means equal to that of the large puff-balls. It is\r\nsometimes attacked by a fungus larger than itself, called Boletus\r\n_parasiticus_, and this parasite is again attacked by a species of\r\nHypomyces, one of the genera of the Pyrenomycetes, which grows in\r\npatches upon dead fungi.\r\n\r\n     PHALLOIDEAE OR PHALLACEAE.\r\n\r\nThe Phalloideae, sometimes called the \"Stink-horn\" fungi on account of\r\ntheir foetid odor, are not numerous, the whole number of described\r\nspecies being about eighty. The plants are watery, quick in growth, and\r\ndecay very rapidly. They are varied in form and are quite unlike the\r\nordinary mushroom types. In some of the genera the plants are columnar\r\nand phalloid, in other clathrate or latticed, in others again the disk\r\nis stellate, and in one genus it is coralloid, but they are all\r\nenclosed, in the early stage, in a volva which is at first hidden or\r\npartially hidden beneath the surface of the ground. A gelatinous stratum\r\nis contained within the firmer outside membrane.\r\n\r\n_Genus Ithyphallus_. In this genus the cap is perforated at the top,\r\nfree from the stem and reticulate. No veil. The mature plants are\r\ncolumnar in form with the remains of the volva enclosing the column-like\r\nstem at the base; the cap in its deeply pitted reticulations somewhat\r\nresembling that of the _Morel_, although of different texture.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate H.\r\n     Gasteromycetes.\r\n     Phalloideae.\r\n     Figs. 1 to 6, Ithyphallus impudicus, Linn. \"Foetid Mushroom.\"\r\n     Fig. 7, Clathrus cancellatus, Fr. \"Latticed Mushroom.\"\r\n     Unwholesome.]\r\n\r\n     PLATE H.\r\n\r\n     FIGS. 1 to 6.--=Ithyphallus= _impudicus_ Linn. \"_Foetid Wood Witch_.\"\r\n\r\nIn the embryonic stage the plant is enclosed in a volva which is\r\ncomposed of three layers, the outer one firm, the intermediate one\r\ngelatinous, and the inner one consisting of a thin membrane. The gleba,\r\nor spore-bearing portion, in the early stage forms a conical honeycombed\r\ncap within the inner shell or membrane, concealing the stem to which it\r\nis attached. The stem at this stage is very short, cylindrical, and\r\ncomposed of small cells filled with a gelatinous substance. The volva is\r\nabout the size of a hen's egg. On maturity it ruptures at the apex. The\r\nstem rapidly expands and, elongating, elevates the cap into the air. The\r\nstem becomes open and spongy, owing to the drying of the gelatinous\r\nmatter and its quick expansion.\r\n\r\nThe whole plant attains a height of from four to ten inches in a few\r\nhours. The hymenial surface is on the outside of the cap, the spores\r\nbeing embedded in its glutinous coated ridges and depressions. The\r\nhymenium is at first firm but rapidly deliquesces, holding the spores in\r\nthe liquid mass. The cap is greenish or greenish-gray in color, changing\r\nto a dark bottle-green. In its deliquescent state the odor is very\r\nrepulsive. While enclosed in the volva the unpleasant odor is not so\r\nperceptible, and it has been eaten in that condition without unpleasant\r\neffects, but in its mature stage it is considered unwholesome, and\r\ncertainly its offensive odor would be quite sufficient to deter most\r\npersons from attempting to test its edible qualities. Flies, however,\r\nare very fond of the fluid, and consume it greedily and with impunity.\r\nIt is found in gardens and woods, its presence being detected several\r\nrods away by the offensive odor. Specimens occur in which the color of\r\nthe cap is white or reddish.\r\n\r\nIn the allied genus _Mutinus_ the pileus is adnate and is not perforated\r\nat the apex. Mutinus _caninus_ resembles _impudicus_ in form, but the\r\ncap is continuous with, not free from the stem, and is crimson in color,\r\ncovered with a greenish-brown, odorless mucus. The stem is hollow,\r\nwhitish, tinted with a pale yellow or orange color. Not common.\r\n\r\n_Genus Clathrus_ Mich. In this genus the receptacle is sessile, and\r\nformed of an obovate globular net-work. At first wholly enclosed in a\r\nvolva which becomes torn at the apex and falls away, leaving a\r\ncalyx-like base at its point of contact with the stem.\r\n\r\n     FIG. 7.--=Clathrus cancellatus= Tourn.\r\n\r\n     UNWHOLESOME.\r\n\r\nReceptacle bright vermillion or orange red, covered at first with a\r\ngreenish mucus which holds the colorless spores. Volva white or pale\r\nfawn color. Odor strongly foetid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMYXOMYCETES OR MYXOGASTERS.--\"_Slime Fungi_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn their early history the Myxomycetes, or \"slime moulds,\" were classed\r\nwith the gasteromycetal fungi, and by Fries grouped as a sub-order of\r\nthe Gasteromycetes, under the name Myxogasters. From this connection\r\nthey were severed in 1833 by Link, who, recognizing certain distinctive\r\nfeatures which entitled them to consideration as an entirely separate\r\ngroup, ranked the Myxogasters, as a separate order, under the title\r\n_Myxomycetes_, _Slime moulds_. De Bary, in a monograph on the subject\r\nwritten some years later, questioned the right of this group to the\r\nplace assigned it in the vegetable world, claiming that the Myxogasters\r\nwere as nearly related to the animal as to the vegetable kingdom, and\r\nchanging the name to Mycetozoa. Massee assailed this position in his\r\n\"Monograph of the Myxogasters,\" pointing out that De Bary derived his\r\nreasons and deductions from the early or vegetative stage of the fungi,\r\nwithout taking sufficiently into account the characteristics of the\r\nlater or reproductive stage in which the great disparity between these\r\norganisms and those of the lower animals becomes apparent.\r\n\r\nDr. Rostafinski, the Polish botanist, and pupil of De Bary, adopts the\r\nname given the group by De Bary, but applies it in a more restricted\r\nsense, classifying on a botanical basis. Both De Bary and Massee have\r\ntheir earnest disciples. M. C. Cooke takes the ground that the\r\nMyxomycetes are entitled to mention as \"_fungi_ which produce their\r\nfructification enclosed within a peridium,\" although considering them as\r\nan aberrant group which, on account of certain peculiarities of their\r\nearly or vegetative stage, should no longer be classed as having\r\naffinity with Gasteromycetes. Without further discussion of the subject,\r\nit is sufficient, for our present purpose, to state that mycologists now\r\nvery generally agree in regarding this group as quite distinct from the\r\nGasteromycetes.\r\n\r\nThe species are minute, rarely exceeding a millimeter in diameter, at\r\nfirst pulpy, then dry. In the early or vegetative stage the \"slime\r\nmould\" is plasmoidal, consisting of a mass of protoplasm without cell\r\nwall, and prefers damp surfaces, such as rotting leaves, moist logs,\r\netc. The whole substance is slippery or slimy and presents different\r\nhues, red, orange, violet, brown, etc., according to species, but never\r\ngreen. It is in the reproductive or fruiting stage that their\r\nresemblance to microscopic puff-balls appears, the sporangium in many\r\nspecies exhibiting a distinct peridium or outer coat which encloses the\r\nspores together with the hair-like threads called the capillitium. On\r\nthe ripening of the spores this peridium ruptures, allowing their\r\nescape, the capillitium lending valuable aid in their dissemination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERA OF GASTEROMYCETES, ACCORDING TO SACCARDO.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I.--PHALLACEAE, OR PHALLOIDEAE.\r\n\r\n    Dictyophora, Desvaugh.\r\n    Ithyphallus, Fr.\r\n    Mutinus, Fr.\r\n    Kalchbrennera, Berk.\r\n    Simblum, Klotzsch.\r\n    Clathrus, Mich.\r\n    Colus, Cav. & Sech.\r\n    Lysurus, Fr.\r\n    Anthurus, Kalchbr.\r\n    Calathiscus, Mont.\r\n    Aseroe, La Bill.\r\n    Staurophallus.

Gills typically free,\r\noften remote, not sinuate or decurrent. Stem generally distinct from the\r\nhymenophore. Volva absent. Habitat terrestrial, mostly found on rich\r\nsoil or in grassy places. (In Saccardo's _Sylloge_, Lepiota is given\r\ngeneric rank.)\r\n\r\nThe Lepiotas have a wide geographical distribution. No less than 225\r\nspecies have been recorded as found in different parts of the world.\r\nThese are pretty evenly divided between the torrid and temperate zones.\r\nThey are generally smaller than the Amanitas, less fleshy and somewhat\r\ndry and tough. The flesh is soft and thready, not brittle. In the plants\r\nof most of the species the cap is rough, the cuticle being broken up\r\ninto tufts or scales. These tufts are readily distinguished from the\r\nwarts which characterize certain species of Amanita, being formed from\r\nthe breaking up of the cuticle with the concrete veil, while the\r\nwart-like excrescences seen upon Amanita _muscaria_, for example, are\r\ncomposed of fragments of the volva, which is always found enclosing the\r\nvery young plants of the genus Amanita.\r\n\r\nA few of the species are characterized by a smooth cap; in some\r\ninstances it is granulose or mealy. Usually the cuticle is dry, but in a\r\nfew of the species it is viscid. The stem is generally long and hollow,\r\nand, being of different texture from the flesh of the cap, is easily\r\nseparated from it, often leaving a distinct socket at the junction of\r\nstem and cap. It is sometimes smooth, sometimes floccose. In some\r\nspecies it is bulbous at the base, in others not. The ring which\r\nencircles the stem is at first continuous with the cuticle of the cap,\r\nbreaking apart with its expansion. It is sometimes movable, sometimes\r\nevanescent.\r\n\r\nThe species generally are considered edible, or innoxious. None are\r\nrecorded as dangerous. A mycophagist from Augusta, Ga., reports,\r\nhowever, that the members of a family in that vicinity were made quite\r\nill from eating the Lepiota _Morgani_, a greenish-spored species of\r\nLepiota, while he himself ate of the same dish, experiencing no\r\nunpleasant effects. I have had no personal experience with this species.\r\n\r\nTwo edible species of Lepiota, which are widely commended as of good\r\nquality, and which are sufficiently abundant to have value as esculents,\r\nare figured in Plate XI. A third, Ag. (Lepiota) cepaestipes, var.\r\ncretaceus--Lepiota _cretacea_, figured in Plate XI-1/2, is an exotic\r\nspecies found in greenhouses. It is of very delicate flavor.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate XI.\r\n     EDIBLE\r\n     Figs. 1 to 4 Agaricus (Lepiota) procerus, Fries (Lepiota procera)\r\n     \"_Parasol Mushroom_.\"\r\n     Figs. 5 to 9 Lepiota naucinoides Peck.

Spores\r\nwhite, elliptical. The color of the cap varies from a light tan or\r\nochraceous yellow to a dark reddish-brown. The surface showing beneath\r\nthe lacerated cuticle is of a lighter hue than the cuticle, and is silky\r\nand fibrillose, giving the cap a somewhat shaded or spotted appearance.\r\nThe flesh is dry, soft and thready, white. Taste and odor pleasant.\r\n\r\nCap from 3 to 5 inches broad; stem from 5 to 10 inches high.\r\n\r\nThis species is commonly found in pastures and in open grassy places;\r\nsometimes in open woods near cultivated fields, usually solitary or in\r\nvery small clusters. It is a favorite among mycophagists. Lepiota\r\n_racodes_ closely resembles Lepiota _procera_, and by some botanists the\r\ntwo are regarded as forms of the same species. In L. _racodes_ the\r\npileus is at first globose, expanded, and finally depressed in the\r\ncentre; the cuticle is thin and broken into persistent scales; the whole\r\nplant smaller than L. procera. Flesh slightly reddish when bruised.\r\nEdible. There is also a white variety (_puellaris_) with a floccose\r\nsquamose cap.\r\n\r\n     PLATE XI.\r\n\r\n     FIGS. 5 to 9.--=Ag.

The gills, soon after gathering, become suffused with a faint\r\npinkish or fleshy tint. The spores are white, sub-elliptical. Specimens\r\noccur in which there is a slight granulation in the centre of the cap,\r\nbut they are rare. The variety _squamosa_ shows the surface of the cap,\r\nsomewhat broken into thick scales.\r\n\r\nL. _naucinoides_ is a very clean and attractive looking mushroom,\r\nusually symmetrical in shape. It is a fleshier mushroom than L.\r\n_procera_, and is found in grassy places, in lawns, sometimes in\r\ngardens, or by roadsides, especially where the soil is rich. The\r\nspecimens figured in Plate XI were gathered in a rose garden, growing in\r\nloamy soil. Specimens have been received from different States, some of\r\nthem much larger than those here illustrated.\r\n\r\nThis mushroom is recorded by some authors as equal in flavor to the\r\nParasol mushroom. When stewed with butter it makes a very appetizing\r\ndish.\r\n\r\nThere is a fatally poisonous mushroom to which it bears some\r\nresemblance, and which might be taken for it, viz., Amanita _verna_, or\r\n\"Spring mushroom.\" It is therefore necessary, in order to guard against\r\nsuch a mistake, to give particular attention to the characteristics of\r\nthese two mushrooms. They are both white throughout, and both have white\r\nspores and ringed stem. Amanita _verna_, however, carries a white volva\r\nor cup-shaped sheath at the base of the stem, and the gills do not show\r\na pinkish or flesh colored tinge at any stage. In Lepiota _naucinoides_,\r\nas in all the Lepiotas, the volva is wanting. Amanita _verna_ is apt to\r\nbe moist and clammy to the touch, and is tasteless. L. _naucinoides_ is\r\ndry, and has a pleasant flavor. The first is found _wholly_ in _woods_;\r\nthe second prefers pastures, open grassy places, and gardens, though\r\nsometimes found in light woods. I have never found an Amanita in a lawn,\r\npasture, or garden.\r\n\r\nAn edible mushroom, Agaricus (Psalliota) _cretaceus_, found in pastures,\r\nbears a slight resemblance to L. _naucinoides_, when the color of the\r\nspores and gills are not taken into consideration. In the former the\r\ngills very quickly change from their early stage of rosy pink to a dark\r\npurplish-brown color, like that of the common mushroom. The spores are\r\npurplish-brown, while in L. _naucinoides_ the pinkish hue which tinges\r\nthe fading plant is very faint, and changes to a very light tan color\r\nwith age. The spores being white, the gills retain their white color for\r\na long time, never changing to dark brown.\r\n\r\nL. _Americana_ Pk. A. & S., L. _excoriata_ Schaeff., and L.\r\n_rubrotincta_ Pk. have been tested and are of good flavor.\r\n\r\nL. _Americana_ has a reddish or reddish-brown cap, umbonate, with close\r\nadpressed scales and white flesh. The gills are broad and free from the\r\nstem, sometimes anastomosing near it, white; stem white, hollow,\r\ntapering towards the cap, annulate. When dried the whole plant has a\r\nbrownish-red hue. When cut or bruised it sometimes exudes a reddish\r\njuice. Miss Banning reports specimens found in Druid Hill Park,\r\nBaltimore. I have gathered very beautiful specimens in Montgomery\r\ncounty, Md. This mushroom sometimes grows to a very large size.\r\n\r\nL. _excoriata_ has a pale fawn-colored cap, slightly umbonate, with thin\r\ncuticle, breaking into scales; gills remote, white; stem white, hollow,\r\nand short, nearly cylindrical. Odor faint, pleasant.\r\n\r\nL. _rubrotincta_ Pk. \"_Red-tinted Agaric_.\" Cap reddish or pinkish,\r\nbroadly umbonate and clothed with adpressed scales; gills whitish, free,\r\nand close; stem nearly equal or slightly thickened at the base, with a\r\nwell-developed persistent white or pinkish ring. Spores white,\r\nsub-elliptical.\r\n\r\nL. _holosericeus_ Fries has a fleshy white cap, soft, silky, and\r\nfibrillose, a solid bulbous stem, with persistent broad, reflexed ring,\r\nand free ventricose, white gills. Edible. It is found in gardens and\r\ncultivated places.\r\n\r\nL. _acutesquamosa_ Wein, found in greenhouses and soil in gardens, is a\r\nheavy but not very tall species. The cap is obtuse, and fleshy, at first\r\nfloccose. As the cap expands it bristles with erect pointed tufts or\r\nscales. The gills are white or yellowish, lanceolate and simple, free\r\nfrom the stem. Stem bulbous, somewhat stuffed, rough or silky below the\r\nring, and downy above. Ring persistent. Color of cap whitish or light\r\nbrown, with darker scales.\r\n\r\nL. _granulosus_ Batsch. Cap thin, wrinkled or corrugated, granulose,\r\nmealy; gills white, _reaching the stem_, sometimes free.

The\r\nplants are a pure white throughout, and both stem and pileus are\r\ncovered with small chalk-white mealy tufts. Berkeley says, \"this species\r\nis probably of exotic origin, as it never grows in the open air.\" It is\r\nalso met with in the hothouses of Europe. Specimens have been received\r\nfrom contributors who gathered them in greenhouses in different\r\nlocalities. This species should not be confounded with the\r\npurplish-brown spored mushroom Agaricus (Psalliota) cretaceus, which has\r\npink gills turning to dark brown and is allied to the common meadow\r\nmushroom.\r\n\r\nLepiota _cretacea_ is a delicious mushroom when broiled, or cooked in a\r\nchafing dish, and served on hot buttered toast. It has a pleasant taste\r\nwhen raw.\r\n\r\nLepiota _Morgani_ Peck, the \"_Green-Spored Lepiota_,\" is an exception to\r\nthe general type of Lepiotas in the color of its gills and spores. It is\r\nwestern and southern in its range. This species is described by Peck in\r\nthe Botanical Gazette of March, 1897, p. 137, as follows: \"Pileus\r\nfleshy, soft, at first sub-globose, then expanded, or depressed, white,\r\nthe brownish or alutaceous cuticle breaking up into scales except on the\r\ndisk; lamellae close, lanceolate, remote, white, then green; stem firm,\r\nequal, or tapering upwards, sub-bulbous, smooth, webby-stuffed, whitish,\r\ntinged with brown, annulus rather large, movable; flesh both of the\r\npileus and stem white, changing to reddish, and then to yellowish hue\r\nwhen cut or bruised; spores ovate, sub-elliptical, mostly uninucleate,\r\n.0004 to .0005 inches long, .0003 to .00032 broad, sordid green.\r\n\r\n\"Plant 6 to 8 inches high, pileus 5 to 9 inches broad, stem 6 to 12\r\nlines thick. Open dry grassy places. Dayton, Ohio. A. P. Morgan.\"\r\n\r\n     AGARICINI.\r\n\r\n_Genus Cortinarius_ Fries. This genus is distinguished by a cob-web-like\r\nveil, dry persistent gills, which in the mature plants become\r\ndiscolored, and pulverulent with the rusty or ochraceous colored spores.\r\nThe veil is very delicate, resembling a spider's web. It is not concrete\r\nwith the cuticle of the cap, but extends from its margin to the stem, in\r\nthe young plants sometimes concealing the gills, but disappearing as the\r\ncap expands. Sometimes a few filaments are seen depending from the\r\nmargin of the cap or encircling the stem.\r\n\r\nIn the young plants of this genus the gills vary very much in color.\r\nThey are whitish, clay-color, violet, dark purple, blood-red, etc.,\r\naccording to species, but, as the plants mature, the gills become dusted\r\nwith the rust-colored falling spores, and with age usually become a\r\nrusty ochraceous, or cinnamon color. The stem in some of the species is\r\ndistinctly bulbous and in others equal, cylindrical, or tapering. In\r\nidentifying the species it is necessary, in order to ascertain the true\r\ncolor of the gills, to examine the plants at different periods of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nThe genus Cortinarius is a large one, and contains many beautiful\r\nspecies. It is mainly confined to temperate regions. Not a single\r\nspecies has been recorded as found in Ceylon, the West Indies, or\r\nAfrica, but one tropical species is found in Brazil. Nearly four hundred\r\nspecies have been described, and over three hundred and seventy of these\r\nbelong to the United States and Europe. A few are found in the extreme\r\nsouthern or temperate portion of South America, and several are reported\r\nfrom a temperate elevation among the Himalayas. Sweden and Great\r\nBritain, with their temperate climates, claim a large proportion of the\r\nEuropean species. Not many of the Cortinarii have been recorded as\r\nedible, and none as dangerous. The Rev. M. J. Berkeley records, however,\r\na case of poisoning by one of the species, C. (Inoloma) _bolaris_ Pers.,\r\nwhich though not fatal was somewhat alarming, the symptoms being great\r\noppression of the chest, profuse perspiration, and the enlargement for\r\ntwo days of the salivary glands of the patient. I have seen no other\r\nstatements relating to the poisonous properties of this species, and the\r\nresults alluded to may have been owing to some individual idiosyncrasy.\r\n\r\nBerkeley, in his \"Outlines,\" gives the following description of this\r\nmushroom: \"Pileus fleshy, obsoletely umbonate, growing pale, variegated\r\nwith _saffron-red, adpressed, innate_ scales; stem stuffed, then hollow,\r\nnearly equal, squamose, of the same color as the cap; gills\r\nsubdecurrent, crowded, watery, cinnamon color. Cap 1 to 2 inches broad.\r\nStem 2 to 3 inches long.\" In beech woods in September and October.\r\n\r\nThe genus Cortinarius has been divided by some authors into the\r\nfollowing six groups: (1) _Phlegmacium_, in which the cap is fleshy and\r\nviscid, the veil partial, and the stem firm and dry; (2) _Myxacium_, in\r\nwhich the veil is universal and glutinous, hence the cap and stem both\r\nviscid; cap thin and the gills adnate or decurrent; (3) _Inoloma_, in\r\nwhich the cap is fleshy, dry, and at first silky with innate fibrils;\r\nveil simple and stem slightly bulbous; (4) Dermocybe, in which the\r\npileus is thinly fleshy, dry, and at first downy, becoming smooth; the\r\nveil single and fibrillose; flesh watery, colored when moist, stem equal\r\nor attenuated downwards; (5) Telamonia, in which the cap is moist, at\r\nfirst smooth or dotted with the superficial fragments of the veil, the\r\nstem ringed below, or peronately scaly from the remains of the universal\r\nveil; (6) Hydrocybe, in which the cap is thin and moist, not viscid,\r\nsmooth, or covered with superficial white fibrils; stem rigid, not\r\nscaly, veil thin, occasionally collapsed in an irregular ring. These\r\nsubdivisions have been designated as _tribes_ by some botanists and\r\n_subgenera_ by others, etc. To the divisions Inoloma and Phlegmacium,\r\nrespectively, belong the two species illustrated in Plate XII.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate XII.\r\n     EDIBLE\r\n     Figs. 1 to 4 Cortinarius (Inoloma) violaceus, Linn.\r\n     \"_Violet Cortinarius_.\"\r\n     Figs. 5 to 7 Cortinarius (Phlegmacium) caerulescens, Fries.\r\n     T.

It is edible, and has a mushroomy taste when raw.\r\nAgaricus _nudus_ Bull, a purple species with white spores, is sometimes\r\nconfounded with it. There are other purple species of Cortinarius not so\r\npleasant to the taste, which bear some resemblance to C. _violaceus_.\r\nThe specimens figured in Plate XII were gathered near Dedham, Mass., on\r\nopen ground on the border of a stretch of pine woods.\r\n\r\n     FIGS. 5 TO 7.--=Cortinarius (Phlegmacium) caerulescens=.\r\n\r\n     EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCap fleshy, at first convex, then plane, surface even, viscid; color\r\nbluish or violet; gills adnexed and crowded, at first bluish, changing\r\nto violet or purplish hues; stem solid, short, and thick, with a broadly\r\nbulbous base, same color as the cap; veil filmy, single. In woods and on\r\nthe borders of woods. This mushroom varies in color, the bluish or\r\npurplish tints being quite susceptible to atmospheric changes. When\r\ngrowing in the shade or well-sheltered places, it is much darker in hue\r\nthan when exposed unsheltered to the bright sunlight. The specimen\r\nfigured in Plate XII was gathered on low ground near a pine grove in\r\nEssex County, Mass.\r\n\r\nCortinarius (Phlegmacium) _purpurascens_ Fr. bears a slight resemblance\r\nto _caerulescens_, but can be distinguished from it by the spotted or\r\nzoned character of the cap and the broadly emarginate gills.\r\n\r\nCortinarius _turmalis_, an edible autumnal species, having an ochraceous\r\nor brownish-yellow cap with emarginate or decurrent gills, the latter at\r\nfirst whitish, then reddish clay color, is found in abundance in some\r\nparts of Maryland. The gills are never tinged with purple or blue. The\r\nflesh is white. The plants are easily discovered by those familiar with\r\ntheir habitat, as they grow under pine needles in groups, forming small\r\nmounds extending over large spaces, and in these hiding places, in the\r\nautumnal months, they are free from insects and dust. I have collected a\r\nbushel of them in less than an hour in fresh condition in October. Some\r\nof the French authors do not class this species as edible. Gillet, in\r\nhis Hymenomycetes of France, enumerates fifty-three edible species of\r\nCortinarius, but places _turmalis_ among the suspects. I find this\r\nmushroom not only edible, but very valuable, because of its abundance in\r\nthe localities where found. It is often densely caespitose. The plant,\r\nwhen mature, is from 3 to 5 inches high.\r\n\r\nC. _sebaeceus_, found also in pine woods, is recorded as edible. The\r\nplant is tall, white-stemmed, with broad tan-colored, somewhat viscid\r\ncap; emarginate gills, clay color at first, at last cinnamon color; stem\r\nsolid, stout, fibrillose, and equal.\r\n\r\nCortinarius _collinitus_, Smeared Cortinarius, and Cortinarius\r\n_cinnamomeus_, with its variety semi-sanguinea, have also been tested,\r\nand found edible. The first of these is somewhat common. The plants when\r\nfresh are covered with a glutinous substance, and this should be removed\r\nbefore cooking. Cap smooth under the glutinous coat, light brown or\r\ntawny yellow in color, flesh white; gills whitish or light gray when\r\nyoung, cinnamon-hued in the matured plant. Stem solid, nearly equal,\r\ncylindrical, yellowish, and somewhat scaly. C. _cinnamomeus_ belongs to\r\nthe division Dermocybe. The cap is thin at first, silky with innate\r\nfibrids, becoming smooth, and varies from light brown to a dark cinnamon\r\ncolor. The gills are yellowish, then cinnamon; stem downy or silky,\r\nyellow. The variety _semi-sanguinea_ has the lamellae red, almost as in\r\nthe preceding species.\r\n\r\nC. (Phlegmacium) _varius_, \"Variable Cortinarius,\" edible, has a compact\r\nfleshy viscid, even cap, brownish in color, gills at first violet,\r\nchanging to cinnamon, stout solid stem, white or whitish, adorned with\r\nadpressed flocci, flesh white.\r\n\r\nCortinarius (Telamonia) _armillatus_ Fries is given in M. C. Cooke's\r\nlist of edible Cortinarii. Cap fleshy but not thick, fibrillose and\r\nslightly scaly, bright bay color, thin uneven margin; stem solid, dingy,\r\nrufescent, showing irregular red zones or bands elongated and slightly\r\nbulbous at the base; gills distant, broad, pallid in color at first,\r\nchanging to dark cinnamon. C. (Telamonia) _haematochelis_ Bull. (edible),\r\nsomewhat resembles the former in color and size, though not so bright a\r\nbrown. Cap thin, silky-fibrillose; gills adnate, narrow and crowded,\r\nlight cinnamon; stem long, solid, dingy, with a reddish zone.\r\n\r\nC. (Hydrocybe) _castaneus_ Bull., _Chestnut Cortinarius_ (edible), is\r\nfound in woods and gardens. The plants of this species are usually\r\nsmall. Cap at first campanulate, expanding, sometimes slightly umbonate\r\nin the centre, chestnut color; gills ventricose, crowded, purplish,\r\nchanging to rust color; stem short, hollow or stuffed, cartilaginous,\r\nequal, pallid, reddish brown, or tinged with violet; veil white.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Subgenus Collybia_ Fries. Cap at first convex, then expanded, not\r\ndepressed, with an involute margin; gills reaching the stem, but not\r\ndecurrent, sometimes emarginate; stem hollow, with cartilaginous bark of\r\na different substance from the hymenophore, but confluent with it; often\r\nswollen and splitting in the middle; spores white. The plants are\r\nusually found growing upon dead tree stumps; some grow upon the ground;\r\na few are parasitic on other fungi or springing from _sclerotia_, small\r\nimpacted masses of mycelium. The species are generally small and firm\r\nand of slow growth. A few are edible, some few have an unpleasant odor.\r\nOn account of the cartilaginous stem and the dryness of their substance,\r\nsome of the smaller species are apt to be taken for Marasmii.

The same collection, which now\r\nbelongs to the Museum of the Department of Agriculture, was exhibited at\r\nthe Atlanta Cotton Exposition in 1895, where a diploma was again awarded\r\nfor it, and has since been exhibited at the exposition of 1897 in\r\nNashville, Tenn. The models composing this collection, about one\r\nthousand in number, were made from actual specimens and colored to\r\nnature, the same species being generally represented by numerous\r\nspecimens so as to illustrate the various stages in the life of the\r\nplant, habit of growth, etc.\r\n\r\nThe following is a list of the mushrooms represented in this collection,\r\namong which there are types of most of the genera in which species\r\nrecorded as edible occur:\r\n\r\nAmanita _Caesarea_ Schaeff. \"Orange Amanita.\" Edible.\r\n\r\nAmanita _rubescens_ Pers. \"The Blusher.\" \"Reddish-Brown Amanita.\"\r\nEdible.\r\n\r\nAmanita _strobiliformis_ Vitt. \"Fir-Cone\" or \"Pine-Cone Amanita.\"\r\nEdible.\r\n\r\nAmanita _pantherinus_ D.

The Pleuroti are similar in some respects to\r\nthe Tricholomas and Clitocybes, some of the species having notched gills\r\nnear the stem, and others, again, having the gills decurrent, or running\r\ndown the stem. Most of the species grow upon dead wood or from decaying\r\nportions of live trees. Very few grow upon the ground. The stem is\r\nmostly eccentric, lateral, or wanting; when present it is homogeneous or\r\nconfluent with the substance of the cap; the substance may be compact,\r\nspongy, slightly fleshy, or membranaceous. Veil evanescent or absent.\r\nThe spores are white or slightly tinted.\r\n\r\nM. C. Cooke figures over thirty species of Pleurotus found in Great\r\nBritain, and describes 45 species found in Australia. With few\r\nexceptions, all of these grow upon wood. Very few have value as\r\nesculents.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate J.\r\n     Agaricus (Pleurotus) ostreatus, Jacq.\r\n     Edible.\r\n     _T. Taylor, del._]\r\n\r\n     PLATE J.\r\n\r\n     =Ag. (Pleurotus) ostreatus= Jacq. \"_Oyster Mushroom_.\"\r\n\r\n     EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCap soft, fleshy, smooth, shell-shaped, white or cinereous, turning\r\nbrownish or yellowish with age. Flesh white, somewhat fibrous. Gills\r\nwhite, broad and decurrent, anastamosing at the base. Stem usually not\r\nwell defined, lateral, or absent. Spores elliptical, white. The caps are\r\nsometimes thickly clustered and closely overlapping, and sometimes wide\r\napart. This mushroom has long been known as edible both raw and cooked.\r\nIt has a pleasant but not decided flavor and must be cooked slowly and\r\ncarefully to be tender and easily digestible. Old specimens are apt to\r\nbe tough. It is found on decaying wood and often on fallen logs in moist\r\nplaces or upon decaying tree-trunks. It is frequently recurrent on the\r\nsame tree. I have gathered great quantities of the Oyster mushroom\r\nduring several seasons past from a fallen birch tree which spanned a\r\nsmall stream. The lower end of the tree rested on the moist ground at\r\nthe edge of the stream. Specimens have been found on the willow, ash and\r\npoplar trees, and upon the apple and the laburnum.\r\n\r\n\r\nPleurotus _sapidus_ Kalchb. _Sapid Pleurotus_. Edible.\r\n\r\nThis species closely resembles the Oyster mushroom in form and habit of\r\ngrowth, and is by some considered only a variety of _P. ostreatus_. It\r\ngrows usually in tufts with the caps closely overlapping, varying in\r\ncolor white, ashy, grayish or brownish. Flesh white. The stems are\r\nwhite, smooth and short, mostly springing from a common base. The gills\r\nare white and very broad, and decurrent. The spores assume a very pale\r\nlilac tint on exposure to the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nPleurotus _ulmarius_ Bull. \"_Elm Pleurotus_.\" Edible.\r\n\r\nThe Elm Pleurotus is quite conspicuous by reason of its large size and\r\nlight color. The cap is smooth and compact, usually whitish with a dull\r\nyellowish tinge in the center. Flesh white. The skin cracks very easily,\r\ngiving it a scaly appearance. The gills are broad, and toothed or\r\nnotched near their point of attachment to the stem as in the\r\nTricholomas, white in color, turning yellowish with age. The stem is\r\nfirm and smooth, solid and rather eccentric, thick and sometimes\r\nslightly downy near the base, from two to four inches in length.\r\nAlthough this mushroom seems to prefer the elm and is most frequently\r\nfound on trees of that species, it is found also upon other trees, but\r\nprincipally the maple, the ash, the willow, and the poplar. It grows\r\nupon live trees, usually where the branches have been cut away, and upon\r\nstumps as well. Most authors recommend it as an esculent, although it\r\nhas not the rich flavor of some other mushrooms. It dries well and can\r\nbe kept thus for winter use. This species has a wide range and grows\r\nmost abundantly in the autumn. Its resistance to cold has been\r\nfrequently remarked.\r\n\r\n      AGARICINI.\r\n\r\nSubgenus _Amanita_. The Amanitas are usually large and somewhat watery,\r\nthe flesh brittle rather than tough. The very young plants are enveloped\r\nin a membranous wrapper, which breaks apart with the expansion of the\r\nplant, leaving a more or less persistent sheath at the base of the stem.\r\nThe universal veil is distinct and free from the cuticle of the cap. The\r\ncap is convex at first, then expanded; in some species naked and smooth;\r\nin others, clothed with membranaceous patches of the volva. The stem is\r\ndistinct from the fleshy substance of the cap, ringed and furnished with\r\na volva or sheath. In some of the species this sheath is connate with\r\nthe base of the stem, firm and persistent. In others, it is friable, at\r\nlength nearly obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe ring is usually persistent, deflexed, more or less prominent, in\r\nrare cases pressed close against the stem, and sometimes scarcely\r\ndistinguishable from it. The gills in most of the species are free from\r\nthe stems, but there are exceptions to this rule. Spores white. As to\r\ngeographical distribution, according to M. C. Cooke, seven-eighths of\r\nthe species are distinctly located in the temperate zone, one-twentieth\r\nat a temperate elevation, and only one-twentieth presumably tropical.\r\nOut of the eighty species, about sixty are North American and European,\r\nand one species is found on the slopes of the Andes, in South America.\r\nAs heretofore stated, this group among mushrooms is made responsible for\r\nmost of the well authenticated cases of fatal poisoning by mushrooms. It\r\nwould be judicious, therefore, for those who are not thoroughly familiar\r\nwith the characteristics of the edible Amanitas to defer making\r\nexperiments with them for table use until that familiarity is acquired.\r\n\r\nSaccardo in his _Sylloge_ describes no less than fifteen edible species\r\nof Amanita as found in different parts of the world. Of those I have\r\npersonally been able to identify but three which are common in this\r\ncountry, and which have been well tested. Specimens of these three\r\nspecies are illustrated in Plates XIV and XIV-1/2 of this pamphlet. They\r\nare each and all found in varying abundance in different parts of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate XIV.\r\n     EDIBLE AMANITAS.\r\n     Figs. 1 to 4 Ag.

Odor faint but agreeable. Spores white, elliptical.\r\n\r\nThe whole plant is symmetrical in form, brilliant in coloring, clean and\r\nattractive in appearance. The American plant seems to differ in some\r\nslight respects from the European as figured and described in European\r\nworks. In Europe the pileus or cap is said to vary in color, being\r\nsometimes white, pale yellow, red or even copper color, although it is\r\nusually orange-yellow. My own observation of the American plant of this\r\nspecies agrees with that of Prof. Peck in that the cap is uniform in\r\ncolor, being at first bright reddish-orange or even brilliant red,\r\nfading with age to yellow, either wholly or only on the margin. No white\r\nspecimens have been as yet recorded in this country. The red color\r\ndisappears in the dried specimens. The striations of the margin are\r\nusually quite deep and long and almost as distant as in the edible\r\nspecies Amanitopsis _vaginata_. Some European writers have described the\r\nflesh or substance of the cap as yellowish. In our plant the flesh is\r\nwhite, but stained with yellow or red immediately under the cuticle.\r\nAmanita _Caesarea_ is the only one of the Amanitas which has yellow\r\ngills.\r\n\r\nBerkeley, in his \"Outlines of British Fungi,\" describes A. Caesarea as it\r\nis found in some parts of Continental Europe, but states that up to the\r\ndate of his writing it had not been found in Great Britain. It is not\r\nrecorded in the more recent lists of British fungi by M. C. Cooke nor in\r\nthat of Australian fungi by the same author. The species has a wide\r\nrange in this country, and though not very common in the North, in some\r\nlocalities, as in the pine and oak woods of North Carolina, it is found\r\nin great abundance. Dufour states that it is much esteemed as an\r\nesculent in France, and though rare in the northern part of that\r\ncountry, it is common in the center and the south of France in autumn.\r\nIt is well known in different portions of Continental Europe, and is\r\nfrequently figured in contrast with its very poisonous congener, Amanita\r\nmuscaria, or \"False Orange,\" commonly known as the \"Fly Amanita,\" or\r\n\"Fly-Killer.\"\r\n\r\nA careless observer might mistake one for the other, but with a little\r\nattention to well-defined details the edible form can be readily\r\ndistinguished from the poisonous one.\r\n\r\nIn analyzing the species the attention should be directed to the\r\nfollowing characteristics of the two mushrooms: In A. _Caesarea_ the cap\r\nis _smooth_, the stem, gills and ring _lemon-yellow_, and the cup-shaped\r\nwrapper or volva which sheathes the base of the stem is white and\r\n_persistently membranous_.\r\n\r\nIn A. _muscaria_ the cap is _warty_ or shows the traces or remains of\r\nwarts; the gills _white_, stem _white_, or only very slightly yellowish,\r\nand the wrapper or volva is evanescent, breaking up into ridge-like\r\npatches adhering to the base of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe Amanita Caesarea has long been esteemed as an esculent in foreign\r\ncountries, and was known in ancient times to the Greeks and Romans. It\r\nis known under the following names: \"Orange,\" \"Caesar's mushroom,\"\r\n\"Imperial mushroom,\" \"Yellow-egg,\" \"Kaiserling,\" etc. Mycologists who\r\nhave tested it agree as to its edibility and delicate flavor.\r\n\r\nThe specimens figured in Plate XIV represent the average size of those\r\nwhich I have gathered in the vicinity of the District of Columbia. Much\r\nlarger ones have been gathered in the woody portions of Druid Hill Park,\r\nBaltimore, Md.\r\n\r\nDufour writes: \"This mushroom, the \"true oronge,\" is cooked in a variety\r\nof ways, and it always constitutes an exquisite dish.\" This author gives\r\nthe following recipes for cooking the _Caesarea_, which he calls the\r\n\"Oronge:\"\r\n\r\n_Oronge a la bordelaise._--The stem is minced with fine herbs,\r\nbread-crumbs, and garlic, and seasoned with pepper and salt. This hash\r\nis placed in the concavity of the caps, and all is put to bake with good\r\noil in a pan steamed in a chafing dish.\r\n\r\n_Oronge a l'Italienne._--Stew gently with a little butter and salt, then\r\nserve with a sauce composed of oil seasoned with the juice of lemon,\r\npepper, garlic, and extract of sweet almond.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish are fond of this mushroom, and it is said to enter into\r\ntheir national dish, olla podrida, a mixture of meat, vegetables, and\r\nspices, whenever it can be obtained.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes fried in butter or olive oil and seasoned with sugar.\r\n\r\n     PLATE XIV.\r\n\r\n     FIGS. 5 to 9.--=Ag. (Amanita) rubescens= Pers. (=Amanita\r\n     rubescens=). \"_The Blusher_,\" \"_Reddish Brown Amanita_.\"\r\n\r\n     EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCap at first convex then expanded, margin even or very slightly\r\nstriated, usually reddish-brown or reddish-fawn color, covered with\r\nmealy, more or loss persistent warts; flesh white, changing to a reddish\r\nor pinkish tinge, where cut or bruised, the reddish tinge most intense\r\nin the bulbous portion of the base of the stem; _gills reaching the stem\r\nand forming decurrent lines upon it_, white, becoming spotted with rusty\r\nor wine red stains when bruised or attacked by insects; stem ringed,\r\nwhitish or dingy white, becoming brownish or spotted, with reddish-brown\r\nstains. The base of the stem is usually bulbous, the bulb sometimes\r\ntapering to a point at the root, and in some instances ending abruptly.\r\n\r\nThe ring or collar which encircles the stem near the top is membranous,\r\nand usually well defined.\r\n\r\nThe volva which completely envelops the young plant is very friable and\r\nsoon disappears. Fragments of the volva may be seen in the shape of\r\nscales or small particles upon the mushroom stem, and in wart-like\r\npatches upon the cap. In the representations of this mushroom which\r\nappear in European works the cap is a deeper reddish-brown tint than I\r\nhave found it here. The color of the cap is usually a light reddish\r\nbrown or reddish gray, sometimes almost white. This species is found\r\nusually in light open woods. In a warm moist climate it appears early in\r\nthe season, and can be gathered until the frosts come. Taste very\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\nThere is a poisonous species, Amanita _pantherinus_, rare, which has a\r\nviscid brown warted cap bearing a slight resemblance to that of the\r\n_rubescens_, but the gills do not turn red when bruised, and the volva\r\nat the base of the stem is well defined and persistent.\r\n\r\nThe _rubescens_ is very plentiful in the woods of Maryland and Virginia,\r\nand specimens have been received from different parts of the country. I\r\nhave frequently eaten it stewed with butter, and found it very good\r\neating. Hay speaks of it as being eaten in England, where it is called\r\nthe \"Blusher.\" Cooke says it is pleasant both in taste and odor. It is\r\nspoken of by French authors as of delicate flavor, and as well known in\r\nsome parts of France. In preparing for the table bring the mushroom to a\r\nquick boil and pour off the first water, then stew with flavoring to\r\nsuit the taste.\r\n\r\nThe specimens of this species represented in Plate XIV were collected in\r\nthe woods of Forest Glen, Maryland. They are often found of much larger\r\nsize and much lighter in coloring, with the stains upon the gills redder\r\nin color. The very young plants as they burst through the surface of\r\nthe soil show a distinct volva at the base of the stem. In the mature\r\nplant this disappears, often leaving the slightly bulbous base quite\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate XIV-1/2.\r\n     Agaricus (Amanita) strobiliformis, Vitt. \"Fir-Cone Mushroom.\"\r\n     Edible.\r\n     From Nature.\r\n     _T.

(Amanita) strobiliformis= Fries (=Amanita strobiliformis=).\r\n     \"_Fir-cone Mushroom_.\"\r\n\r\n     EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCap fleshy, convex at first, then expanded, covered with persistent\r\nwhite warts, margin even, white; flesh white, firm and compact; gills\r\nrounded behind and free from the stem, white; stem solid, the bulbous\r\nbase tapering, furrowed with concentric and longitudinal channels at the\r\nroot, and extending well into the ground, white; ring large, soon\r\nsplitting; volva breaking up and appearing in concentric ridges upon the\r\nstem. Spores white.\r\n\r\nThis mushroom is very pleasant to the taste when raw as well as when\r\ncooked. It is found in light woods or on the borders of woods where the\r\nsoil is somewhat friable, generally solitary, but sometimes two or three\r\nare found clustered together. The plants are sometimes so large that two\r\nor three of them would make a very good meal. Specimens have been found\r\nwith the cap measuring 8 to 9 inches across when expanded, the stem\r\nvarying from 6 to 8 inches in height, and from 1 to 3 inches in\r\nthickness. When young the plants are generally snowy white throughout,\r\nchanging with age to a dingy white or cinereous hue. The specimens\r\nfigured in the plate formed one of a cluster of three mushrooms of this\r\nspecies found growing in the fir woods of the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nDuring some seasons I have found the _strobiliformis_, or \"Fir-cone\r\nmushroom,\" fairly plentiful in some parts of Maryland, and in other\r\nseasons it has been rare. The whole plant when young is enclosed in a\r\nwhite membranous wrapper.\r\n\r\nAlthough this species is very generally recognized by mycologists as\r\nedible, I would advise great caution in selecting specimens for table\r\nuse, since there is a dangerous species which might be mistaken for it\r\nby one not familiar with the characteristics of both species; I refer to\r\na form of Amanita muscaria with ochraceous yellow cap which, when faded\r\nor bleached by the sun and rain, sometimes approaches, in tint, the\r\ndingy white of old or faded specimens of the _strobiliformis_. Both\r\nspecies have _white gills_, _white stems_, and _white flocculent veil_.\r\nThe volva is evanescent in both, leaving traces of its existence in\r\nconcentric ridges at the base, and part way up the stem.\r\n\r\nIn the species _strobiliformis_, the flesh of the cap is white\r\nthroughout, as well as the cuticle.\r\n\r\nIn the yellowish _muscaria_, the flesh _immediately_ beneath the cuticle\r\nof the upper surface of the cap is yellowish, frequently deepening at\r\nthe disk to orange hue.\r\n\r\nThe cap of Amanita _muscaria_ is very attractive to flies, but proves\r\nto them, as also to roaches and to some other insects, a deadly poison.\r\n\r\nThe juice of _strobiliformis_ is not poisonous to flies. This fact may\r\naid in identifying the species.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenus _Amanitopsis_ Roze. The species of this subgenus were formerly\r\nincluded in Amanita. The characteristic which separates it from Amanita\r\nis the _absence of a ring on the stem_. The gills are free from the\r\nstem, the spores are white, and the whole plant in youth is encased in\r\nan egg-shaped volva.[A]\r\n\r\n[A] Although this subgenus is not included in M. C. Cooke's analytical\r\nkey to the order of Agaricini, published with his kind permission in No.\r\n3 of this series, he now includes it as one of the subgenera which\r\nshould have a place in that list.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmanitopsis _vaginata_ Roze. Edible.\r\n\r\nThis species is very common in pine and oak forests. The plant, as a\r\nwhole, has a graceful aspect and grows singly or scattered through open\r\nplaces in the woods. It is somewhat fragile and easily broken. The cap\r\nin this species is usually a mouse-gray, sometimes slaty gray or\r\nbrownish, generally umbonate in the center and distinctly striated on\r\nthe margin.\r\n\r\nThe stem is white, equal, and slender in proportion to the width of the\r\ncap, and sheathed quite far up with a loose white membranous wrapper.\r\nThis sheath is so slightly attached to the base of the stem that it is\r\noften left in the ground if the plant is carelessly pulled. The gills\r\nare white, or whitish, free from the stem and rounded at the outer\r\nextremity.\r\n\r\nThere is a white variety, (variety _alba_) A. _nivalis_, in which the\r\nwhole plant is white, and a tawny variety (A. _fulva_ Schaeff.) in which\r\nthe cap is a pale ochraceous yellow, with the gills and stem white or\r\nwhitish. In the variety A. _livida_ or A. _spadicea_ Grev. the cap is\r\nbrown, while the stem and gills are tinged a smoky brown.\r\n\r\nThese are all edible and of fairly good flavor. Except in the absence of\r\nthe ring upon the stem, the light varieties might be mistaken for small\r\nforms of the poisonous species Amanita _verna_ or of _phalloides_. Great\r\ncaution should therefore be observed, in gathering for the table, to be\r\nsure of the species.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: Plate XV.\r\n     Figs. 1 to 7. Ag. (Amanita) muscarius, Linn.

Spores widely\r\nelliptical, white, .0003 to .0004 of an inch in length.\r\n\r\nThe plants of this species vary very much in size and in the color of\r\nthe cap. The latter is sometimes a bright scarlet and again it is orange\r\ncolor, more frequently ochraceous yellow, fading to a very pale yellow\r\ntint. In the variety _albus_ it is white. The stem is stuffed with webby\r\nfibrils and varies very much in thickness: sometimes in young specimens\r\nit is very stout, with a thick ovate bulb reaching well up towards the\r\ncap, and again it is comparatively slender and nearly equal from the cap\r\ndown to a very slight bulb at the base. The very young plant is\r\ncompletely enveloped in a white or yellowish egg-shaped wrapper or\r\nvolva, which, being friable, generally breaks up into scales, forming\r\nwarts upon the upper surface of the cap. When the plant is young and\r\nmoist the cap is slightly sticky. A thickish white veil extends from the\r\nstem to the inner margin of the cap. This breaks away with the growth\r\nand expansion of the plant and falls in lax folds, forming a deflexed\r\nring round the upper portion of the stem.\r\n\r\nThis mushroom is very common in woods and forests in summer and autumn,\r\nand has a wide geographical range. It is recorded by all mycologists as\r\npoisonous. One author states that when eaten in very small quantities it\r\nacts as a cathartic, but that it causes death when eaten freely. Flies\r\nfind in it a deadly poison, and the poisonous alkaloids are not\r\ndestroyed by drying.\r\n\r\nAlthough cases are cited where this mushroom has been eaten without\r\ninjury, its fatally poisonous effects have been too well and too often\r\ntested to allow of any doubt as to the danger of eating it, even in\r\nsmall quantities.\r\n\r\nAmanita Frostiana, Frost's Amanita, is a much smaller species than A.\r\nmuscaria. It bears a very close resemblance to the Fly Amanita, and\r\nmight easily be taken for a small form of the same. The cap is yellowish\r\nand warted, and specimens occur in which the stem and gills are slightly\r\ntinged with yellow. It is poisonous.\r\n\r\n     PLATE XV.\r\n\r\n     FIG. 8.--=Ag. (Amanita) phalloides= Fries (=Amanita phalloides=)\r\n     =A. vernalis= Bolt., =A. verrucosus= Curtis. \"_Poisonous Amanita_,\"\r\n     \"_Death Cup_.\"\r\n\r\n     POISONOUS.\r\n\r\nCap bell-shaped or ovate at first, then expanded, smooth, obtuse,\r\nviscid, margin even, creamy-white, brown, or greenish, without warts;\r\nflesh white; stem white, hollow or stuffed, bulbous at the base,\r\nannulate; gills rounded and ventricose, coarse, and persistently white,\r\nfree from the stem; volva conspicuous, large, loose, adhering to the\r\nbase, but free from the stem at the top, with the margin irregularly\r\nnotched. In the white forms there is frequently a greenish or yellow\r\ntinge at the disk or centre of the cap. The white form is most common,\r\nbut the brownish is often found in this country. I have not yet found\r\nthe green-capped variety sometimes figured in European works. In the\r\nbrown variety the stem and ring are often tinged with brown, as also the\r\nvolva. The cap is usually from 2 to 3 inches broad, and the stem from 3\r\nto 5 inches long. The whole plant is symmetrical in shape and clean\r\nlooking, though somewhat clammy to the touch when moist. It is very\r\ncommon in mixed woods, in some localities, and is universally considered\r\nas fatally poisonous.\r\n\r\nThe white form of A. _phalloides_, although in reality bearing very\r\nlittle resemblance to the common field mushroom, has been mistaken for\r\nit as also for the _Smooth white lepiota_, and in some instances has\r\nbeen eaten with fatal results by those who gathered it.\r\n\r\nThe distinction between this most poisonous Amanita and the common field\r\nmushroom is well marked. In the common mushroom the _gills_ are _pink,\r\nbecoming dark brown_, the _spores purplish brown_, and the whole\r\nmushroom is stout and short stemmed, the stem being shorter than the\r\ndiameter of the cap, and having no volva, or wrapper at its base. In the\r\nspecies A. _phalloides_ the _gills_ are _persistently white_ and the\r\nbulb is distinct and broad at the base, the white cup-shaped wrapper\r\nsheathing the base of the stem like the calyx of a flower. The _Smooth\r\nwhite lepiota_ shows neither volva nor trace of one, and has other\r\ndistinct characteristics which distinguish it from A. _phalloides_. See\r\npage 14, No. 4 of this series.\r\n\r\nThe specimen figured in Plate XV grew in Maryland, where it is quite\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n     PLATE XV.\r\n\r\n     FIG. 9.--=Ag.

The plant\r\nis creamy white throughout and does not seem to be easily\r\ndistinguishable from the white forms of A. _phalloides_. Fries and some\r\nothers consider this species merely a variety of Amanita _phalloides_,\r\nand it is regarded as equally poisonous, the poisonous principle being\r\nthe same as that of A. _phalloides_. It is very common in mixed woods\r\nfrom early spring to frosty weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALOIDS OF THE POISONOUS MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchrader, after some experiments made in 1811, stated that the poisonous\r\nprinciple of the \"Fly mushroom,\" Amanita muscaria, seemed to be combined\r\nwith its red coloring matter and might be extracted by water or aqueous\r\nalcohol, but that it was not soluble in ether.\r\n\r\nVaquelin, as the result of more extended investigations made in 1813,\r\nexpressed the opinion that this poison was not confined to the coloring\r\nmatter of the mushroom, but that it was an integral part of the fatty\r\nconstituents not only of _muscaria_ but of several species of mushrooms.\r\nIn 1826 and 1830, and again in 1867, important investigations were made\r\nand published by Letellier relating to the medical and poisonous\r\nproperties of mushrooms growing around Paris. Letellier's early\r\ninvestigations led him to the conclusion that there were two poisons\r\ncontained in certain fungi--(1) an acrid principle easily destroyed by\r\ndrying or boiling or by maceration in alcohol or in alkaline solution,\r\nand (2) a peculiar poisonous alkaloid found only in certain of the\r\nAmanita group. Letellier in 1866 named this latter alkaloid _amanitin_.\r\nHe then considered it to be the active poison of Amanita _muscaria_,\r\nAmanita _phalloides_, and Amanita _verna_, but a subsequent analysis by\r\nthe German chemists Schmiedeberg and Koppe showed the _amanitin_ of\r\nLetellier to be identical with _cholin_, a substance found in bile.\r\nKobert says that _amanitin_ is non-poisonous in itself, but states that\r\nit may be changed on decay of the mushroom to the muscarin-like acting\r\n_neurin_, which is highly poisonous. He thinks it highly probable that\r\nnearly all of the edible and non-edible mushrooms contain pure\r\n_amanitin_ (cholin) partly in primitive condition and partly in a more\r\nintricate organic connection, as _lecithin_. It has been demonstrated\r\nthat amanitin separates very readily from lecithin during the _decay or\r\ncareless drying_ of mushrooms and changes into the _poisonous neurin_;\r\nhence the necessity of using mushrooms only when _perfectly fresh_ or\r\nwhen _quickly dried_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSCARIN.[A]\r\n\r\n[A] The earliest account of the separation of the poisonous principles\r\nof the mushrooms of the genus Amanita dates back to the experiments of\r\nApoiger in 1851. Harnack's researches were published in 1876 and those\r\nof Huseman in 1882.\r\n\r\nTo the eminent German chemists Schmiedeberg and Koppe is due the credit\r\nof isolating the active poisonous principle of the Fly mushroom\r\n(_muscarin_). These authors published in 1869 a series of interesting\r\nexperiments made with _muscarin_, having relation to its effect upon the\r\nheart, respiration, secretions and digestive organs, etc., and this was\r\nsupplemented by other experiments made by their pupils, Prof. R. Boehm\r\nand E. Harnack. Schmiedeberg and Koppe's work relates to the effect of\r\nthis poison on man as well as upon the lower animals. Dr. J. L. Prevost\r\nin 1874 reviewed the investigations made by Schmiedeberg and Koppe in a\r\npaper read before the Biological Society of Geneva, adding some\r\nconfirmatory observations of his own relative to experiments made with\r\nmuscarin upon the lower animals. The experiments made by these authors\r\ndemonstrated \"that muscarin arrests the action of a frog's heart, that a\r\nmuscarined frog's heart began to beat immediately under the influence of\r\natropin, and further that it was impossible to muscarine a frog's heart\r\nwhile under the influence of atropin.\"\r\n\r\nSchmiedeberg subjected cats and dogs to doses of muscarin, large enough\r\nto produce death, and when the animals were about to succumb, injected\r\nhypodermically from one to two milligrams of sulphate of _atropin_,\r\nafter which the toxic symptoms disappeared and the animals completely\r\nrevived. Prof. Boehm found that _digitalin_ likewise re-established\r\nheart action when suspended by the action of muscarin.\r\n\r\nIn man the fatal termination, in cases of mushroom poisoning, where the\r\nantidote is not used, may take place in from 5 to 12 hours or not for\r\ntwo or three days.\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof. E. Kobert's recent chemical analysis, the \"Fly\r\nmushroom,\" Amanita muscaria, contains not only the very poisonous\r\nalkaloid _muscarin_ and the _amanitin_ of Letellier (_cholin_), but also\r\na third alkaloid, _pilz atropin_. The pilz-atropin (mushroom atropin)\r\nwas discovered by Schmiedeberg in a _commercial_ preparation of\r\n_muscarin_, and later Prof. Kobert discovered it in varying proportions\r\nin fresh mushrooms of different species. The effect of this third\r\nalkaloid, it is claimed, is to neutralize to a greater or less extent\r\nthe effect of the poisonous one. Under its influence, when present in\r\nquantity, the poison is almost entirely neutralized. Contraction of the\r\npupils changes to dilation, and slowing of the pulse may disappear. Only\r\nthrough the presence of this natural antidote in the Fly mushroom, says\r\nKobert, is it possible, as in some parts of France and Russia, to eat\r\nwithout danger this mushroom, which contains 10% of sugar (trehalose or\r\nmycose) in a fermented and unfermented condition. He states also that\r\ndelirium, intoxication, and other symptoms which, according to Prof.\r\nDittmer of Kamschatka and various scientific travellers, are reported\r\neffects of the Fly mushroom in the extreme north, are not experienced in\r\nthe same degree in southern Russia. This difference in action, he\r\nthinks, may be very properly attributed to the varying proportion of the\r\nabove-mentioned atropin in the mushroom or to the presence of substances\r\nwhich develop only in the extreme north.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of _muscarin_ poisoning, apart from vomiting and purging,\r\nare slowing of the pulse, cerebral disturbance, contraction of the\r\npupils, salivation and sweating. In case of death, which is caused by\r\nsuffocation or a suspension of heart action, the lungs are found to be\r\nfilled with air, and there is a transfusion of blood in the alimentary\r\ncanal.\r\n\r\nProf. R. Kobert, in a lecture delivered before the University of Dorpat\r\nin 1891, states that _muscarin_ is found equally in the Fly mushroom (A.\r\nmuscaria), the Panther mushroom (A. pantherinus), Boletus luridus, and\r\nin varying quantities in Russula emetica. He states also that though\r\nhighly poisonous to vertebrates, _muscarin_ is not so to flies, and that\r\nthe noxious principle in A. muscaria which kills the flies is not as yet\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the lower animals, such as sheep and geese, as\r\nwell as man, have been severely poisoned by feeding on the \"Fly\r\nmushroom,\" and that in the case of the horse, experiments have\r\ndemonstrated that even 0.04 of a gramme, 0.62 of a grain, have caused\r\nmarked symptoms of poisoning.\r\n\r\nFor _muscarin_ as for _neurin_ poisoning the antidote is atropin\r\nadministered internally or by subcutaneous injection.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHALLIN.\r\n\r\nThe toxic alkaloid of Amanita _phalloides_ Fries (Amanita _bulbosa_) was\r\nexamined by Boudier, who named it \"_bulbosin_,\" and by Ore, who named it\r\n\"_phalloidin_,\" but their examinations, it is claimed, proved little\r\nbeyond the fact that it seemed to be in the nature of an alkaloid,\r\nidentical neither with _muscarin_ nor _helvellic_ acid.\r\n\r\nOre affirmed that the _phalloidin_ of the Amanita phalloides was very\r\nnearly related to, and perhaps identical with, strychnine. From this\r\nview Kobert and others dissent.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous principle of Amanita _phalloides_ has recently been\r\nsubjected to very careful analysis by Prof. Kobert. As a result of a\r\nlarge number of experiments and post-mortem examinations held on persons\r\npoisoned by A. _phalloides_, Kobert states that the symptoms can be\r\nexplained uniformly by the action of a poison, to which he gives the\r\nprovisional name of \"_phallin_.\" This is an albuminous substance which\r\ndissolves the corpuscles of the blood, resembling in this and other\r\nrespects in a remarkable degree the action of _helvellic_ acid.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kobert _phallin_ has so far only been found in Amanita\r\n_phalloides_ and in its varieties _verna_, _mappa_, etc. He finds also\r\nin this mushroom muscarin and an atropin-like alkaloid.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of the phalloides poisoning are complex. Vomiting is\r\naccompanied by diarrhoea, cold sweats, fainting at times, convulsions,\r\nending in coma. There is also fever and a quickening of the pulse. All\r\nthese symptoms, which follow in succession, according to one author, are\r\ndependent on two different poisonous substances. The first may be an\r\nacrid and fixed poison, for it is found after repeated dryings, as well\r\nin the aqueous as in the alcoholic extract. The second acts by\r\nabsorption, and is purely narcotic.\r\n\r\nPhallin has some of the properties of the toxalbumin of poisonous\r\nspiders, and is a vegetable toxalbumin.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that in cases of poisoning by A. _phalloides_, the\r\nmushroom has tasted very good, and those poisoned felt well for several\r\nhours after eating.\r\n\r\nPhalloides poisoning is said to bear a marked resemblance to phosphorus\r\npoisoning and to acute jaundice. There is no known antidote to the\r\npoisonous alkaloid _phallin_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Prof. Kobert's analyses, the proportion of phallin in the\r\ndried mushroom amounts to less than 1%, but its effect on account of its\r\nconcentration is the more intensive.\r\n\r\nExtensive experiments made by Kobert with ox blood in regard to the\r\ncomparative action of different substances in their power of dissolving\r\nthe red blood corpuscles demonstrate that _phallin_ in this respect\r\nexceeds all known substances. Kobert states that \"If _phallin_ be added\r\nto a mixture of blood with a 1% solution of common salt, using the blood\r\nof man, cattle, dogs, or pigeons, the blood corpuscles will be entirely\r\ndissolved by the poison diluted to 1-125,000.\"\r\n\r\nProf. Kobert states that he has examined the species Boletus edulis,\r\nAgaricus campester, and Amanita Caesarea a number of times, but could\r\nnever detect the action of phallin in them. Neither has he found it in\r\nA. muscaria.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POISONOUS ALKALOID OF GYROMITRA ESCULENTA FRIES (HELVELLA ESCULENTA\r\nPERS.)\r\n\r\nHELVELLIC ACID.\r\n\r\nProf. Kobert writes of a number of cases of poisoning in the Baltic\r\nprovinces of Russia by the mushroom Helvella _esculenta_ Persoon,\r\nsometimes called the Lorchel. It should be here stated that the\r\n_Helvella esculenta_ of Persoon is the _Gyromitra esculenta_ of Fries.\r\nThis mushroom is described as edible and placed in the edible lists by\r\nDr. M. C. Cooke, Prof. Peck, and other distinguished mycologists, who\r\nhave tested it and found it edible when perfectly fresh.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous principle of this mushroom was isolated and analyzed by\r\nProf. R. Boehm, of Russia, in 1885. It was by him designated as\r\n\"_helvellic acid_,\" and found to be soluble in hot water. Profs. Eugene\r\nBostroem and E. Ponfick, after giving some study to the effects of this\r\nmushroom poison, agreed in their report concerning it, which is to the\r\neffect that the _quickly dried_ H. _esculenta_ (Gyromitra _esculenta_)\r\nis not poisonous, and that the poisonous acid of the fresh ones may be\r\nextracted by means of hot water, so that while the decoction is\r\npoisonous the mushroom is not at all so, after the liquid is pressed\r\nout. Experiments with this mushroom were made by both authors on dogs,\r\nwhich ate them greedily, but without exception the dogs were very sick\r\nafterwards. The symptoms were nausea, vomiting, jaundice, stoppage of\r\nthe kidneys, and haemaglobinuria. The symptoms observed in man correspond\r\nto those manifested by the lower animals. Dissection showed the\r\ndissolution of innumerable blood corpuscles.\r\n\r\nProf. Kobert, commenting on the experiments made by Bostroem and\r\nPonfick, states that he himself had been furnished yearly with fresh\r\nspecimens of \"H. _esculenta_\" (G. _esculenta_) specially gathered for\r\nhim at Dorpat, and after making various experiments with the freshly\r\nexpressed juice he became convinced that the poisonous principle greatly\r\nvaries, the juice sometimes operating as very poisonous, and sometimes\r\nas only slightly so. He states also that the proportion of poison in the\r\nmushroom varies with the weather, location, and age of the mushroom. The\r\ninhabitants of Russia do not eat this mushroom, but in Germany it is\r\neaten dried or when perfectly fresh, after cooking, and after the first\r\nwater in which it is boiled is removed.\r\n\r\nHelvellic acid is not found in Morchella _esculenta_ (the true Morel),\r\nnor is it known to exist in any other species except G. _esculenta_. It\r\nhas been stated that there is no antidote for helvellic poisoning after\r\nthe symptoms have appeared.\r\n\r\nA specimen of Gyromitra esculenta was forwarded to me from Portland,\r\nMaine, by a member of a mycological club of that city, who stated that\r\nthis mushroom was quite abundant in the early spring in the woods near\r\nPortland and that the plants were eaten by the members of the club,\r\n_care being taken to use them only when perfectly fresh_. Indigestion\r\nand nausea followed the eating of old specimens, but the general opinion\r\nwas \"favorable to the Gyromitra as an addition to the table.\" (See page\r\n6, part 2, of this series.)\r\n\r\nProf. Chas. H. Peck, of Albany, while placing this mushroom in his\r\nedible list as one which he had repeatedly tested, advises that it\r\nshould be eaten only when perfectly fresh, as nausea and sickness had\r\nbeen known to result from the eating of specimens which had been kept\r\ntwenty-four hours before cooking.\r\n\r\nI forwarded a number of drawings of the American species of G.\r\n_esculenta_, together with a dried specimen of the same received from\r\nMaine, to Prof. Kobert, who identified both drawings and specimen as the\r\n_Gyromitra esculenta_ of Fries, synonymous with the _Helvella esculenta_\r\nof Persoon. Prof. Kobert also informs me that he finds the fresh G.\r\n_esculenta_ perfectly harmless when freed of the water of the first\r\nboiling. He says: \"My wife and I eat it very often, when in fresh\r\ncondition, and after the first water in which it is boiled is poured\r\noff.\" The active poisonous principle of this mushroom is the _helvellic\r\nacid_, which is soluble in hot water. When the mushroom is gathered\r\nfresh and _quickly dried_ it is then also innoxious. In this respect it\r\ndiffers from the species _A. muscaria_, in which the poisonous alkaloid\r\n_muscarin_ is not destroyed in the drying, but remains unchanged for\r\nyears in the dried mushroom.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there have been seemingly well-authenticated cases of\r\nfatal poisoning in the eating of this mushroom shows that if used at\r\nall it should be eaten _only when the conditions essential to safety are\r\nmost carefully observed_, and as these mushrooms show varying qualities,\r\naccording to local conditions of soil and climate, etc., amateurs\r\nfinding it in localities where it has not been heretofore used should\r\nproceed tentatively and with much care before venturing to eat it\r\nfreely.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONOUS AND DELETERIOUS MUSHROOMS OF THE LACTAR, RUSSULA, AND BOLETUS\r\nGROUPS.\r\n\r\nLactarius _torminosus_ Fries contains in its milky juice an acrid resin\r\nwhich causes inflammation of the stomach and of the alimentary canal.\r\nWhen parboiled and the first water removed, it has been eaten without\r\ninjurious effects. Lactarius _plumbeus_ Bull., Lactarius _uvidus_ Fries,\r\nLactarius _turpis_ Weinn., and Lactarius _pyrogalus_ Bull., all acrid\r\nmushrooms, according to Kobert, are similarly poisonous.\r\n\r\nOf the \"Erdschieber\" (Lactarius _vellereus_) and the \"Pfefferling\"\r\n(Lactarius piperatus Scop.) Kobert says they are eaten in parts of\r\nRussia and in some places in Germany, but that neither is very safe.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a species of _Russula_ (R. _emetica_) very common in woods,\r\neasily recognized by its smooth scarlet top, white gills, and white stem\r\nand by its biting acridity, which, though recorded as poisonous by some\r\nauthors, is considered edible by others. This mushroom, R. _emetica_,\r\nhas been subjected to chemical analysis by Kobert, who finds in it\r\n_muscarin_, _cholin_, and _pilz-atropin_ in varying proportions. Kobert\r\nstates that in Germany it is \"_rightly_\" considered poisonous, though\r\neaten in Russia, and ascribes the fact that it is not deemed poisonous\r\nin the latter country to the manner in which it is there prepared, the\r\npoisonous alkaloid being in greater part eliminated by parboiling the\r\nmushrooms, and not merely pouring off the water, but carefully squeezing\r\nit out of the parboiled fungi.\r\n\r\nTo the presence in this mushroom of the neutralizing alkaloid\r\n\"pilz-atropin\" in varying proportions may also be attributed in some\r\nmeasure the safety with which it has been eaten under certain\r\nconditions. R. foetens and other acrid Russulas, as well as Lactars,\r\nhave been known to produce severe gastro-enteritis.\r\n\r\nConsidering the foregoing, it would seem the part of prudence at least\r\nto avoid such of the Lactars and Russulas as have an acrid or peppery\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nI think it would be a wise precaution to pour off the water of the first\r\nboiling in the case of all mushrooms about which there is a particle of\r\ndoubt, whether _recorded_ as poisonous or not.\r\n\r\nLactarius _torminosus_ Fries. Cap fleshy, at first convex, then\r\nexpanded, at length depressed in the center, slightly zoned, margin\r\nturned inwards, pale ochraceous yellow, with flesh-colored mottlings;\r\n_downy_ or _hairy_; gills whitish, changing to pinkish yellow, narrow\r\nand close together; stem equal, stuffed or hollow, pallid or whitish;\r\nmilk persistently _white and acrid_.

Gills narrow, white\r\nor whitish; stem stuffed or hollow, viscid, and of same color as the cap\r\nor paler; milk white and very acrid.\r\n\r\nM. C. Cooke divides the genus Lactarius into 4 \"Tribes\": (1) Piperites,\r\nin which the stem is central, gills _unchangeable_, naked, neither\r\ndiscolored nor _pruinose_, milk at first _white_ and _commonly acrid_;\r\n(2) Dapetes, in which the stem is central, gills naked, _milk from the\r\nfirst deeply colored_; (3) Russulares, in which the stem is central,\r\ngills pallid, _then discolored_, becoming darker, changing when turned\r\nto the light, at length _pruinose_, with milk at _first white_ and\r\n_mild_ and _sometimes becoming acrid_; (4) Pleuropos, in which the stem\r\nis concentric or lateral.\r\n\r\nTo the first of these subdivisions, _Piperites_, belong all of the\r\nLactars enumerated above. The Russians eat the Piperites only after the\r\nwater of the first boiling has been taken off.\r\n\r\nLactarius _rufus_ Scop., a very acrid species of large size, having\r\nreddish ochraceous gills and zoneless cap of reddish yellow with white\r\nmilk, belongs to the subdivision Russulares. Common in fir woods.\r\nDangerous.\r\n\r\nLactarius _volemus_ Fries, a tawny yellow-capped mushroom with white\r\ngills changing to a yellowish hue, and copious _sweet_ white milk,\r\nbelongs also to the latter subdivision. Edible.\r\n\r\nRussula (Fragiles) _emetica_ Fries. Cap fleshy, at first convex, then\r\nexpanded or depressed, smooth, polished, red, margin sulcate; gills\r\nfree, equal and broad, white; stem solid but somewhat spongy in the\r\ncenter, smooth, short, stoutish, white or stained reddish; flesh white,\r\nsometimes slightly tinted red, under the thin red cuticle. The cap of\r\nthis mushroom varies from a deep rich crimson to a pale pinkish red,\r\nbeing very subject to atmospheric changes. Specimens are often found\r\nwith the cap washed almost white after heavy rains, or with but a slight\r\nred spot in the center. The gills and spores are pure white, and the\r\nflesh peppery to the taste. If tasted when raw the juice should not be\r\nswallowed.\r\n\r\nThe variety _Clusii_ has a blood-red cap, pallid yellowish gills,\r\nadnexed, becoming adnate. Spores white. In woods. Acrid. The variety\r\n_fallax_ is fragile, with dingy reddish pileus and adnexed, distant,\r\nwhitish gills.\r\n\r\nBesides the above mentioned, there are other acrid Russulas and Lactars\r\nwhich are regarded with suspicion, though not as yet satisfactorily\r\ntested.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONOUS BOLETI.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Boleti have the reputation of being poisonous or\r\ndeleterious, among them Boletus _luridus_, Boletus _Satanas_, and\r\nBoletus _felleus._ Kobert's analysis of B. _luridus_ shows the presence\r\nof the poisonous alkaloid muscarin in this mushroom, while the\r\nbitterness of B. _felleus_ should make one chary of eating it in\r\nquantity, if at all. Schmiedeberg and Koppe describe experiments made\r\nwith Boletus Satanas, in which the symptoms experienced closely resemble\r\nthose of muscarin poisoning.\r\n\r\nA correspondent living in Georgia, who is quite familiar with the\r\nspecies, writes that he has frequently eaten the yellow form of the\r\n_muscaria_, when cooked, without serious inconvenience. Another\r\ncorrespondent writes that he has eaten the species Boletus luridus and\r\nBoletus Satanas, as well as several other mushrooms of poisonous repute,\r\nwith perfect impunity.\r\n\r\nWithout calling in question the testimony of persons who state that they\r\nhave with impunity eaten mushrooms generally found to be poisonous, it\r\nmust be said that even if, through local conditions of soil or climate,\r\nthe poisonous constituents of such mushrooms sometimes exist in\r\ncomparatively minute proportions, or are _neutralized_ by an unusual\r\nproportion of _mushroom atropin_ in the plant, or eliminated by some\r\nprocess used in its preparation for the table, or, finally, if\r\nconstitutional idiosyncrasies should enable some persons safely to eat\r\nwhat is poisonous to others, the rule that such are to be avoided should\r\nnever be disregarded by the ordinary collector, nor should it be\r\ndeparted from even by experts, except upon the clearest evidence that in\r\nthe given case the departure is safe. It is certainly the part of\r\ndiscretion, when in doubt, to take no risks.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT INSTANCES OF MUSHROOM POISONING.\r\n\r\nAbout a year ago a physician in Vineland, New Jersey, furnished the\r\nfollowing in regard to his personal experience of the effects of\r\nmushroom poisoning: \"My wife, daughter, and self selected, according to\r\nan article in the Encyclopedia Britannica, what we thought were a nice\r\nlot of mushrooms, cooked them in milk, and ate them for dinner with\r\nrelish. In a few hours we were vomiting, laughing, and staggering about\r\nthe house. We could not control ourselves from the elbows to the finger\r\ntips, nor our legs from the knee to the ends of our toes. In other\r\nwords, we were drunk on mushrooms. The mushrooms grew within the shade\r\nof Norway spruce and other ornamental trees on the lawn in front of our\r\nhouse. They were pure white inside and out; smooth shiny tops that\r\neasily peeled off. The caps were about two or three inches in diameter,\r\nand had a stem of the same length. On the day before, my wife and a\r\nfriend ate some of these mushrooms raw and experienced no bad effects.\r\nThe next day at noon we ate them cooked in milk with a little butter,\r\nand they were very good. About two o'clock our food did not seem to\r\ndigest well, and soon my daughter, sixteen years of age, vomited all her\r\ndinner. Then my wife began to feel the effects, and took hot water\r\nfreely, sweet oil, currant wine, and at last an overdose of\r\ntartar-emetic. Of course, she was the sickest of all. I was cool and\r\nhappy and amused at the situation, and drunk from my head down. I did\r\nnot vomit, and my mushrooms remained with me for at least 48 hours. I\r\ntook nothing but hot water and sweet oil. A friend of my daughter's of\r\nher own age partook of the mess and had not a single bad symptom.\"\r\n\r\nA physician from West Grove, Pennsylvania, writes: \"I determined to risk\r\na test of the Amanita muscaria. Accordingly, two good-sized specimens\r\nwere steamed in butter. I ate one, and another member of my family ate\r\nthe other, feeling that the consequences could not be serious from so\r\nsmall an amount. About an hour after eating, a sensation of nausea and\r\nfaintness was experienced in both cases, followed by nervous tingling,\r\nsome cold perspiration and accelerated and weakened action of the heart.\r\nConsiderable prostration ensued within two hours. Knowing that sulphate\r\nof atropin has proved the most successful remedy for the active\r\nprinciple of the Fly agaric, Amanita muscaria, a small dose,\r\none-sixtieth of a grain, was taken by each. Considerable relief was\r\nexperienced within 30 minutes, and all unpleasant symptoms had\r\ndisappeared within 6 hours, without repeating the medicine.\"\r\n\r\nAnother case, wherein the antagonism of atropin for muscarin was\r\ndemonstrated, was brought to our notice during the month of September of\r\nthe past year. An entire party of people were badly poisoned by eating\r\nmushrooms, and, although a doctor was called in very late, most of them\r\nwere saved by the use of sulphate of atropin.\r\n\r\nIt would seem from the foregoing cases that the intensity and action of\r\nthe mushroom poison must depend in some degree on the constitution of\r\nthe individual, as well as on the quality and quantity of the mushrooms\r\neaten. The first treatment should be to get rid of the poison\r\nimmediately and by every possible means, so as to prevent or at least\r\narrest the progress of inflammation of the alimentary canal, and at the\r\nsame time to prevent the absorption of the poison. In a majority of\r\ncases the recovery of the victim depends solely upon the promptness with\r\nwhich vomiting is excited. Vertigo, convulsions, spasms, and other grave\r\nnervous symptoms, which ordinarily follow the cessation of the most\r\nimportant functions, yield, ordinarily, to the action of an emetic\r\nwithout the necessity of ulterior remedies, if taken in time, while the\r\nsubstance is yet in the stomach; when it has entered the lower bowels\r\npurgation is necessary. Sweet oil should always be taken in combination\r\nwith castor oil, or such other purgatives as are used. Enemas of cassia,\r\nsenna, and sulphate of magnesia have also been used with good effect.\r\n\r\nThe fatal poisoning of Count Achilles de Vecchj, in November, 1897, by\r\neating the Amanita muscaria, is so fresh in the public recollection, and\r\nthe details in regard to it were so widely published through the\r\nnewspaper press, that it is unnecessary to take up space in\r\nrecapitulating the circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe death of Chung Yu Ting, in 1894, was occasioned by eating mushrooms\r\nwhich he had collected in a patch of woods near Washington, D. C., and\r\nwhich I identified at the time as Amanita phalloides, sometimes called\r\nthe \"Death Cup.\" He had eaten very freely of this mushroom and died\r\nafter great suffering, although ten hours had elapsed before the toxic\r\neffects began to show themselves.\r\n\r\nSince it has been shown that vinegar and the solution of common salt\r\nhave the power to dissolve the alkaloids of the poisonous mushrooms, it\r\nfollows that the liquor thus formed must be extremely injurious. It\r\nshould, therefore, be obvious that vinegar and salt should not be\r\nintroduced into the stomach after poisonous mushrooms have been eaten.\r\nThe result would only be to hasten death. Ether and volatile alkali are\r\nalso attended with danger. A physician should in all cases be promptly\r\ncalled, and, if muscarin poisoning is suspected, hypodermic injections\r\nof the sulphate of atropin, the only chemical antidote known to be\r\nefficacious, should be administered, the dose being from 1/180 up to\r\n1/35 of a grain. Small doses of atropin can also be taken internally, to\r\naccelerate heart action. To relieve the pains and irritation in the\r\nabdomen sweet oil and mucilaginous drinks should be given.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY--FUNGI.\r\n\r\nNORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\n\r\nBerkeley, M.

Fig. 3, the exposed inner surface of the cap, should be\r\n                   _smooth_, not _ridged_, as the straight lines in the\r\n                   engraving might suggest.\r\n  Plate V.       For Lactarious read Lactarius.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART 3.\r\n\r\n  Plate VIII.    The red on the upper surface of the cap is too bright in\r\n                   tint. It should be a dull brick-red.\r\n  Plate IX.      Fig. 6. The spores should be a deeper tint or brownish\r\n                   purple.\r\n\r\n    The spores as delineated on the plates represent a magnification of\r\n    from 400 to 500 diameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Notes.\r\n\r\nTo avoid confusion, corrections noted above were not made to the plates\r\nor their captions.\r\n\r\n\"Membranaceous,\" \"membraneous\" and \"membranous\" all appear multiple\r\ntimes; I left them as is.
