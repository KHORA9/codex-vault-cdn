It has been thought better to adopt the views of\r\nrecognised leading specialists in the various groups, and thus place\r\nbefore the reader the combined results of recent investigation. This\r\nmethod may, perhaps, occasion a certain number of small discrepancies,\r\nbut it is believed that the ultimate effect will be to the advantage of\r\nthe student.\r\n\r\nThe classification adopted for the recent Cephalopoda is that of\r\nHoyle (‘Challenger’ Reports, _Zoology_, vol. xvi.), for the fossil\r\nCephalopoda (Nautiloidea) that of Foord (_Catalogue of the Fossil\r\nCephalopoda in the British Museum_, 1888–91), and (Ammonoidea) P.\r\nFischer (_Manuel de Conchyliologie_, 1887). In the Gasteropoda the\r\noutlines are those adopted by Pelseneer (_Mém. Soc. Malacol. Belg._\r\nxxvii. 1894), while the details are derived, in the main, from P.\r\nFischer. The Amphineura, however, have not been regarded as a separate\r\nclass. The grouping of the Nudibranchiata is that of Bergh (Semper,\r\n_Reisen im Archipel der Philippinen_, ii. 3). The Pelecypoda are\r\nclassified according to Pelseneer’s most recent grouping.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgment of the principal sources of information has been made in\r\nfootnotes, and a short list of leading authorities has been appended\r\nto the chapters on anatomy, for the use of students desirous to pursue\r\nthe subject further. In the case of geographical distribution the\r\nauthorities are too numerous and scattered to admit of a list being\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nA special word of thanks is due to Mr. Edwin Wilson for his patient\r\ncare in preparing the illustrations, the majority of which are taken\r\nfrom specimens in the University Museum of Zoology. Mr. Edgar Smith,\r\nbesides affording the kind help which visitors to the British Museum\r\nalways experience at his hands, has permitted me to use many specimens\r\nfor the purposes of illustration.\r\n\r\n                                                         A.

A. H. COOKE, M.A.\r\n             Fellow and Tutor of King’s College, Cambridge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n   INTRODUCTION--POSITION OF MOLLUSCA IN THE ANIMAL\r\n     KINGDOM--CLASSIFICATION--ORIGIN OF LAND AND\r\n     FRESH-WATER MOLLUSCA\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the generally accepted opinion among men of science that all\r\nlife originated in the sea. Not that all parts of the sea are equally\r\nfavourable to the development of forms of life. The ocean surface,\r\nwith its entire absence of shelter or resting-place, and the deep sea,\r\nwhose abysses are always dark and cold and changeless, offer little\r\nencouragement to plant or animal life, as an original starting-point.\r\nTrue, both the surface and the depths of the sea have become colonised\r\nby myriads of forms, Mollusca amongst them, but these quarters are in\r\nthe truest sense colonised, for the ancestors of those who inhabit them\r\nin all probability migrated from elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIt was no doubt the littoral region and the shallow waters immediately\r\nbelow it, a region of changeable currents, of light and shade, of\r\nvariation, within definite limits, of temperature and tide effects,\r\nwhich became the scene of the original development of plant life,\r\nin other words, of the food-supply which rendered possible its\r\ncolonisation by higher animals. But the littoral region, besides the\r\nadvantages of tenancy which it offers to animal life, has also its\r\ndrawbacks. The violence of the surf may beat its inhabitants in pieces,\r\nthe retreat of the tide exposes them, not merely to innumerable enemies\r\nin the shape of predatory birds and beasts, but also to a change in\r\nthe atmospheric medium by which they are surrounded. Hence, in all\r\nprobability, have arisen the various forms of adaptation which are\r\ncalculated to bring about the ‘survival of the fittest’; hence, to\r\nnarrow our point of view to the MOLLUSCA, the development of\r\nhard shells, or exoskeletons, hence the sand-burrowing, rock-boring,\r\nrock-clinging instincts of various genera and species.[1]\r\n\r\nWhat was the primitive form of molluscan life is little likely to be\r\never positively known, although, on grounds of comparative anatomy,\r\nsomething approaching to the archi-mollusc is often constructed, with\r\nmore or less probability, by careful observers. From one of the oldest\r\nknown geological strata, the Cambrian, nearly four hundred species\r\nof Mollusca are known, which include representatives of nearly all\r\nthe great Orders as they exist at the present day, and without the\r\nslightest sign of approximation to one another. With regard to the\r\norigin of the land and fresh-water Mollusca some definite conclusions\r\ncan be arrived at, which will be given in their proper place.\r\n\r\nScarcely any portion of the coast-line of the world is destitute of\r\nmolluscan life, except in regions where extreme cold forbids its\r\nexistence. Thus along the shores of Northern Asia there is no proper\r\nlittoral fauna, the constant influence of travelling ice sweeping it\r\nall away; animal life begins at about three fathoms. But in every coast\r\nregion not positively hostile to existence Mollusca make their home.\r\nEach description of habitat has its own peculiar species, which there\r\nflourish best, and exist precariously, if at all, elsewhere. Thus the\r\nsandy waste of estuaries, the loose and shingly beaches, the slimy\r\nmud-flats beset with mangroves, the low stretches of jagged rock, and\r\neven the precipitous cliffs, from whose base the sea never recedes,\r\nhave all their own special inhabitants. The same is true of the deep\r\nsea, and of the ocean surface. And when we come to examine the land and\r\nfresh-water Mollusca, it is found not merely that some Mollusca are\r\nterrestrial and others fluviatile, but that certain species haunt the\r\nhills and others the valleys, some the recesses of woods and others the\r\nopen meadow sides, some prefer the limestone rocks, others the sandy\r\nor clayey districts, some live only in still or gently moving waters,\r\nwhile others are never found except where the current is rapid and\r\npowerful.\r\n\r\nIt is within the tropics that the Mollusca become most numerous, and\r\nassume their finest and quaintest forms. A tropical beach, especially\r\nwhere there is a good tide-fall and considerable variety of station,\r\nabounds in molluscan life to an extent which must literally be seen to\r\nbe believed. The beach at Panama, to select an instance familiar to\r\nthe present writer, is astonishingly rich in species, which probably\r\namount in all to several hundreds. This is due to the immense variety\r\nof habitat. On the rocks at high-water mark, and even above them,\r\noccur _Truncatella_, _Melampus_, _Littorina_, and _Siphonaria_;\r\nwhere a mangrove-swamp replaces the rock, on the branches overhead\r\nare huge _Littorina_, while three species of _Cerithidea_ crawl on\r\nthe mud, and _Cyrena_ and _Arca_ burrow into it. Lower down, in the\r\nrock pools at half-tide mark are _Cerithium_, _Purpura_, _Omphalius_,\r\n_Anachis_ (2 sp.), _Nassa_, and several _Crepidula_. At low-water\r\nmark of ordinary tides, under stones half buried in clean sand, are\r\n_Coecum_ and _Vitrinella_; under the blocks which rest on solid rock\r\nare _Cypraea_ (4 or 5 sp.), _Cantharus_, more _Anachis_, _Columbella_\r\n(3 sp. including the graceful _C. harpiformis_), and _Nitidella_.\r\nWhere the blocks of rock are rather muddy, _Conus_ lurks, and with it\r\n_Turritella_ and _Latirus_. Where the rocks form a flat-topped platform\r\n2 or 3 feet high, with here and there a deep crack, huge Chitons 3\r\ninches long conceal themselves, with two species of _Turbo_, _Purpura_,\r\nand _Clavella_. At extreme low-water mark of spring tides, _on_ the\r\nisolated rocks are _Monoceros_, _Leucozonia_, and _Vermetus_, _in_ them\r\nare _Pholas_ and a burrowing _Mytilus_, _under_ them are more _Conus_,\r\n_Dolium_, and huge frilled _Murices_. Patches of clean gravelly sand\r\nhere produce _Strombus_; on the operculum of the great _Str. galea_\r\nis sure to be a _Crepidula_, exactly fitting its breadth. On the\r\nliquid mud-flats to the north glide about _Marginella_, _Nassa_, and\r\n_Truncaria_, in the clean sandstretch to the west _Olivella_ ploughs\r\nabout by hundreds with several species of _Natica_, and _Tellina_\r\nand _Donax_ bury themselves deep, while farther down are _Artemis_,\r\n_Chione_, and, where mud begins to mix with the sand, _Mytilus_\r\nand more _Arca_. Each of these species has its own habitat, often\r\ncircumscribed to a few square feet at the most, and it would be utterly\r\nuseless to seek for it anywhere except in its own special domain.\r\n\r\nEqually abundant are the land Mollusca of the tropics. Prof. C. B.\r\nAdams relates that within the limits of a single parish in Jamaica,\r\nnamed Manchester, which measures no more than four miles long and one\r\nmile broad, he obtained no fewer than one hundred species. Mr. J. S.\r\nGibbons, in a description of the Mollusca he obtained near St. Ann’s,\r\nCuraçao, gives a lively picture of their abundance in an exceptionally\r\nfavoured locality:--[2]\r\n\r\n“Near the outskirts of the town a waste piece of ground supplied\r\nme with occupation for all the time I had to spare. Neither grass\r\nnor water was to be seen, the only vegetation consisting of a few\r\nstunted cacti and still fewer acacia bushes. This, however, was so\r\nrich in shells that of several species enough specimens could have\r\nbeen collected in a few yards to supply, I should suppose, all the\r\nshell cabinets in the world.... The stones, plants, and ground were\r\ncovered with _Strophia uva_ L., _Tudora megacheila_, P. and M., was\r\nin equal abundance, suspended by its silk-like thread from acacia\r\nboughs, or strewed thickly on the ground underneath. A _Bulimulus_\r\n(_B. multilineatus_ var. _sisalensis_) abounded on the smaller boughs,\r\nwhile under masses of coral _Macroceramus inermis_ Gundl., _Pupa\r\nparraiana_ d’Orb, and _P. pellucida_ Pfr., were abundant. In the loose\r\nsoil _Cylindrella Raveni_ Bland, _Cistula Raveni_ Bland, and a curious\r\n_Cionella_ were so numerous that a spade would have been the best\r\ninstrument with which to collect them. I wasted a good deal of valuable\r\ntime in separating them from the soil, when by simply taking away a few\r\nhandfuls of mould, I might have obtained a larger number of specimens.\r\nA species of _Stenogyra_ and a _Succinea_ complete a list, all of which\r\nmight have been gathered from almost any square yard of ground on the\r\nhillside.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Position of Mollusca in the Animal Kingdom.=--Up to very recent times\r\nit was usual to regard the Mollusca as one of the four subdivisions\r\nof a great family known as _Malacozoa_, the subdivisions being (1)\r\nMollusca, (2) Tunicata, (3) Brachiopoda, (4) Polyzoa or Bryozoa. This\r\nclassification is still retained in the leading modern manual on the\r\nsubject.[3] The progress, however, of investigation leads to the belief\r\nthat the Mollusca are not so closely related to these other groups as\r\nsuch a classification would seem to imply. The Tunicata, for instance,\r\nappear, from the whole course of their development, to occupy a\r\nposition near to the Vertebrata. The relations of the Brachiopoda\r\nand Polyzoa will be more particularly referred to in that part of\r\nthis History which deals especially with those groups. The position\r\nof the Mollusca is, in many respects, one of considerable isolation.\r\nAny attempt, therefore, definitely to relate them to one group or\r\nanother, is, in all probability, to go further than the present state\r\nof our knowledge warrants. Especially to be deprecated are systems of\r\nclassification which confidently _derive_ the Mollusca in general from\r\nthis or that group. The first undisputed traces of animal life, which\r\nappear in the Cambrian epoch, exhibit the same phyletic distinctions as\r\nnow exist. Sponges, Echinoderms, Mollusca, and Worms, formed already,\r\nin those immeasurably remote ages, groups apparently as generally\r\ndistinct from one another as they are at the present time. It would\r\nseem that any theory of development, which confidently teaches the\r\nderivation of any one of these groups from any other, is, in the\r\npresent state of the evidence before us, hazardous in the extreme.\r\n\r\nSome indications of relationship, which must not be pushed too far, may\r\nbe drawn from a consideration of embryonic resemblance. An especial\r\ncharacteristic of the Mollusca is the possession of a particular form\r\nof larva, which occurs in one of the stages of development, known as\r\nthe _trochosphere_ (see p. 130). This form of larva is shared with two\r\norders of Annelida, the Chaetopoda and the Gephyrea armata, and, in\r\nall probability, with the Polyzoa as well. It may also be significant\r\nthat the adult form in Rotifera bears a close resemblance to the\r\ntrochosphere larva in those groups.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Basis of Classification.=--The Mollusca are divided into four\r\ngreat Orders--=Cephalopoda=, =Gasteropoda=, =Scaphopoda=, and\r\n=Pelecypoda=.[4] Each name, it will be noticed, bears reference to the\r\n‘foot,’ _i.e._ to the organ of motion which corresponds in function to\r\nthe foot in the Vertebrata.\r\n\r\nIn the _Cephalopoda_ the feet, or, as they are more frequently termed,\r\nthe ‘arms,’ are arranged symmetrically round the head or mouth. The\r\ncommon forms of ‘cuttle-fish’ (_Octopus_, _Loligo_) are familiar\r\nexamples of Cephalopods.\r\n\r\nThe _Gasteropoda_ crawl on the flat under-surface or ‘sole’ of the\r\nfoot. Snails, slugs, sea-hares, whelks, periwinkles, and coats-of-mail\r\nor chitons are examples of this Order.\r\n\r\nThe _Scaphopoda_ possess a long tubular shell open at both ends; with\r\ntheir small and elongated foot they are supposed to dig into the mud in\r\nwhich they live. The common _Dentalium_ or tusk-shell of our coasts is\r\na representative of this Order.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Examples of the four Orders: =A=,\r\n  Cephalopoda; =B=, Gasteropoda; =C=, Scaphopoda, and =D=,\r\n  Pelecypoda.\r\n\r\n  =A=, _Ommastrephes sagittatus_ Lam., Naples: _a_, _a_,\r\n  arms surrounding the mouth; _f_, funnel; _t_, _t_, the two\r\n  ‘tentacular’ arms, × ⅖. =B=, _Buccinum undatum_ L., Britain: _f_,\r\n  foot; _pr_, proboscis. × ½. =C=, _Dentalium entalis_ L., Norway:\r\n  _f_, foot. =D=, _Cardium oblongum_ Chem., Naples: _f_, foot; _s_,\r\n  efferent or anal siphon; _s’_, efferent or branchial siphon, × ½.]\r\n\r\nThe _Pelecypoda_[5] are enclosed in a bivalve shell fastened by a\r\nmuscular hinge, the adjacent part of the valves being generally more or\r\nless toothed; the foot is as a rule roughly comparable to the shape of\r\nan axe-head.\r\n\r\nTo these four Orders is frequently added a fifth, the _Pteropoda_,\r\nwhose exact position is at present not absolutely settled. The\r\nPteropoda[6] are ‘pelagic,’ _i.e._ they live in the open waters of the\r\nocean, rising to the surface at night, and sinking into cooler water by\r\nday. They are provided with a pair of wing-like appendages or ‘feet,’\r\non each side of the head, by means of which they are enabled to swim.\r\nSome authorities regard the Pteropoda as a subdivision of Gasteropoda,\r\nothers as forming a separate Order, of equivalent value to the other\r\nfour. The question will be further discussed below (see chap. xv.),\r\nbut for the present it will be sufficient to state that the weight of\r\nevidence appears to show that the Pteropoda are modified Gasteropoda,\r\nwith special adaptations to pelagic life, and are therefore not\r\nentitled to rank as a separate Order.\r\n\r\nSome writers conveniently group together the first three of these\r\nOrders, the Cephalopoda, Gasteropoda, and Scaphopoda, under the\r\ntitle =Glossophora=,[7] or Mollusca furnished with a _radula_ or\r\nribbon-shaped ‘tongue,’ set with rows of teeth and situated in\r\nsomething of the nature of a head, as distinguished from the =Aglossa=\r\n(or _Lipocephala_),[8] _i.e._ those Mollusca which have no radula and\r\nno head. To the latter belong only the fourth Order, the Pelecypoda.\r\nThis view postulates, for the primitive ancestral Mollusc, a body\r\nwith a more or less developed head, and possibly the rudiments of an\r\napparatus for grinding or triturating food. This form, it is held,\r\neither developed or degenerated. In the former case, in consequence\r\nof the more active mode of life upon which it may be supposed to have\r\nentered, it gave rise to all the more highly organised forms which\r\nare grouped under the three great Orders. When, on the other hand,\r\nthe ancestral form associated itself with an inactive or sedentary\r\nlife, it was, we may believe, modified accordingly, and either lost\r\nby atrophy or failed to acquire those special points of organisation\r\nwhich characterise the highly-developed form. Hence the Pelecypoda, or\r\nbivalves, whose characteristic is the absence of any definite cephalic\r\nregion or masticatory apparatus. It is a remarkable fact in support\r\nof this theory of the origin of the Aglossa that certain of their\r\nlarvae are known to possess traces of higher organisation, _e.g._ an\r\nexternal mouth and eyes, the former of which becomes covered by the\r\nmantle lobes, while the latter disappear long before the adult stage is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nThus we have\r\n\r\n                                MOLLUSCA\r\n                                    |\r\n                   +----------------+----------------------------------+\r\n                   |                                                   |\r\n           =Glossophora=                                    =Aglossa=\r\n                   |                                                   |\r\n          +--------+----------+-------------------+                    |\r\n          |                   |                   |                    |\r\n _Cephalopoda_   _Gasteropoda_   _Scaphopoda_    _Pelecypoda_\r\n\r\n\r\n=Classification of Gasteropoda.=--The _Gasteropoda_ are numerically\r\nvery largely in excess of the two other Orders of the Glossophora,\r\nfar more complicated as regards classification, and contain a large\r\nproportion of those examples of the Mollusca which are most familiar\r\nto the ordinary observer. It will therefore be convenient to postpone\r\nfor the present a fuller discussion of the subdivisions of the\r\nCephalopoda and Scaphopoda, as well as of the Aglossa, returning to\r\nthem again in special chapters (chaps. xiii. and xvi.), and to devote\r\na few introductory words to the classification and relations of the\r\nGasteropoda.\r\n\r\nThe Gasteropoda are divided into four Classes, _Amphineura_,\r\n_Prosobranchiata_, _Opisthobranchiata_, and _Pulmonata_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--An example of the Polyplacophora: _Chiton\r\n  spinosus_ Brug.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--An example of the Aplacophora, _Neomenia\r\n  carinata_ Tullb.: _a_, anus; _gr_, ventral groove; _m_, mouth.]\r\n\r\n(1) The _Amphineura_[9] are bilaterally symmetrical Mollusca, _i.e._\r\nwith organs either single and central, or paired and disposed on\r\neither side of the longer axis of the animal. The shell, when\r\npresent, is never spiral, but consists of eight overlapping plates,\r\nkept together by an elliptical girdle. The Amphineura are divided\r\ninto (_a_) _Polyplacophora_,[10] or Chitons, and (_b_) _Aplacophora_\r\n(_Chaetoderma_ and _Neomenia_).\r\n\r\n(2) The _Prosobranchiata_[11] are so named from the fact that the\r\nbreathing organ (branchia or ctenidium[12]) is as a rule situated _in\r\nfront of_ the heart, the auricle at the same time being in front of\r\nthe ventricle. They are asymmetrical, almost always furnished with a\r\nshell, which is at some time spiral, and with an operculum. The sexes\r\nare separate. They are either marine animals, or can be shown to be\r\nmore or less directly derived from genera which are marine. They\r\nare divided into (_a_) _Diotocardia_[13] (_Haliotis_, _Fissurella_,\r\n_Trochus_, _Nerita_, _Patella_), which have, or whose immediate\r\nancestors are believed to have had, two auricles to the heart, two sets\r\nof breathing organs, two kidneys, but no proboscis, penis, or siphon,\r\nand (_b_) _Monotocardia_,[14] in which the heart has only one auricle,\r\nthe true breathing organ is single, and there is a single kidney. To\r\nthis division belong the great majority of marine univalve Mollusca,\r\n_e.g._ _Cypraea_, _Buccinum_, _Murex_, _Littorina_, _Ianthina_,\r\nall the land and fresh-water operculates (_Cyclostoma_, _Melania_,\r\n_Paludina_, etc.), as well as the _Heteropoda_, which are a group of\r\nProsobranchiata which have betaken themselves to a pelagic life.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Example of a Heteropod, _Carinaria\r\n  mediterranea_ Lam., Naples: _a_, anus; _br_, branchia; _f_, foot;\r\n  _i_, intestine; _m_, mouth; _p_, penis; _s_, sucker; _sh_, shell;\r\n  t, tentacles. × ½. The animal swims foot uppermost.]\r\n\r\n(3) In the _Opisthobranchiata_[5] the breathing organs (when present)\r\nare _behind_ the heart, and the auricle of the heart is consequently\r\nbehind the ventricle. They are asymmetrical marine animals; usually,\r\nbut by no means always, without a shell, scarcely ever with an\r\noperculum in the adult state. The sexes are united in the same\r\nindividual. The _Opisthobranchiata_ fall into two divisions: (_a_)\r\n_Tectibranchiata_, in which the breathing organ is more or less covered\r\nby the mantle, and a shell is usually present, which is sometimes\r\nrudimentary, _e.g._ _Bulla_, _Aplysia_, _Umbrella_, and the whole\r\ngroup of _Pteropoda_; (_b_) _Nudibranchiata_, or sea slugs, which have\r\nno shell and no true ctenidia, but breathe either by the skin, or by\r\n‘cerata’ or papilliform organs prominently developed on the back:\r\n_e.g._ _Doris_, _Aeolis_, _Dendronotus_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.--=A=, A Tectibranchiate Opisthobranch,\r\n  _Umbrella mediterranea_ Lam., Naples: _a_, anus; _br_, branchia;\r\n  _f_, foot; _m_, mouth; _rh_, rhinophores; _sh_, shell.\r\n\r\n  =B=, A Pteropod, _Hyalaea tridentata_ Forsk., Naples: _sh_,\r\n  shell; _l_, _l_, swimming lobes of foot.\r\n\r\n  =C=, A Nudibranchiate Opisthobranch, _Aeolis peregrina_, Naples:\r\n  _f_, foot; _c_, cerata.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--Examples of--=A=, Pulmonata\r\n  Basommatophora, the common _Limnaea peregra_ Müll.: _e_, _e_,\r\n  eyes; _t_, _t_, tentacles. =B=, Pulmonata Stylommatophora, _Helix\r\n  hortensis_ Müll.: _e_, _e_, eyes; _t_, _t_, tentacles; _p. o_,\r\n  pulmonary orifice (the position of the pulmonary orifice in\r\n  _Limnaea_ will be seen by reference to Fig. 101).]\r\n\r\n(4) The _Pulmonata_[15] are asymmetrical air-breathing non-marine\r\nMollusca, generally, but not always, furnished with a shell. The sexes\r\nare always united in the same individual, and the operculum is always\r\nwanting, except in _Amphibola_. They are conveniently divided into\r\n_Stylommatophora_,[16] in which the eyes are at the tip of the upper\r\ntentacles, which are retractile (_Helix_, _Limax_, _Bulimus_, and all\r\ntrue land slugs and snails), and _Basommatophora_, in which the eyes\r\nare at the base of the tentacles, which are not retractile (_Limnaea_,\r\n_Planorbis_, _Physa_, and all the _Auriculidae_).\r\n\r\nThus we have\r\n\r\n                { _Amphineura_         { Polyplacophora\r\n                {                      { Aplacophora\r\n                {\r\n                { _Prosobranchiata_    { Diotocardia\r\n =Gasteropoda=  {                      { Monotocardia (incl.

The problem\r\nof the origin and mutual relationship of the various forms of molluscan\r\nlife is of extreme subtlety, and its solution can only be approached\r\nafter a comprehensive survey of many complicated anatomical details.\r\nBut there is one branch of the Mollusca--the land and fresh-water\r\ngenera--whose origin is, comparatively speaking, of recent date, and\r\nwhose relationships are therefore less likely to have suffered complete\r\nobliteration.\r\n\r\n=Origin of the Land and Fresh-water Mollusca.=--The ultimate\r\nderivation of the whole of the land and fresh-water molluscan fauna\r\nmust, as has already been remarked, be looked for in the sea. In\r\ncertain cases the process of conversion, if it may be so termed, from\r\na marine to a non-marine genus, is still in progress, and can be\r\ndefinitely observed; in others the conversion is complete, but the\r\nmodification of form has been so slight, or the date of its occurrence\r\nso recent, that the connexion is unmistakable, or at least highly\r\nprobable; in others again, the modification has been so great, or the\r\ndate of its occurrence so remote, that the actual line of derivation is\r\nobscured or at best only conjectural.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--=A=, the common cockle (_Cardium edule_\r\n  L.). =B=, _Adacna plicata_ Eichw., Caspian Sea. =C=, _Didacna\r\n  trigonoides_ Pall., Caspian Sea.]\r\n\r\nThis passage from a marine to a non-marine life--in other words, this\r\ndirect derivation of non-marine from marine genera--is illustrated\r\nby the faunal phenomena of an inland brackish-water sea like the\r\nCaspian, which is known to have been originally in connexion with the\r\nMediterranean, and therefore originally supported a marine fauna.\r\nThe Mollusca of the Caspian, although without exception brackish- or\r\nfresh-water species, are in their general facies distinctly marine.\r\nOf the 26 univalve species which inhabit it 19 belong to 4 peculiar\r\ngenera (_Micromelania_, _Caspia_, _Clessinia_, _Nematurella_), all of\r\nwhich are modified forms of the marine _Rissoidae_. The characteristic\r\nbivalves belong to the genera _Adacna_, _Didacna_, and _Monodacna_, all\r\nof which can be shown to be derived from the common _Cardium edule_.\r\nWe have here a case where complete isolation from the sea, combined\r\nno doubt with a gradual freshening of the water, has resulted in the\r\ndevelopment of a number of new genera. The singularly marine facies\r\nof several of the fresh-water genera now inhabiting Lake Tanganyika,\r\nhas given rise to the belief, among some authorities, that that lake\r\nwas at one time an inlet of the Indian Ocean. In the upper waters of\r\nthe Baltic, marine and fresh-water Mollusca flourish side by side.\r\nSo complete is the intermixture, that an observer who had lived on\r\nno other shores would probably be unable to separate the one set of\r\nspecies from the other.[18] Thus between Dagö and Papen-Wiek[19]\r\n_Mytilus edulis_, _Cardium edule_, _Tellina balthica_, _Mya arenaria_,\r\n_Littorina rudis_, and _Hydrobia balthica_ are the only true marine\r\nspecies; with these live _Unio_, _Cyclas_, _Neritina_, _Limnaea_, and\r\n_Bithynia_. The marine species and _Neritina_ live down to 15–20 fath.,\r\nthe rest only down to 3 fath. Under stones close to the shore of the\r\nSkärgård at Stockholm[20] are found young _Cardium_ and _Tellina_,\r\nand at 3 to 6 fath. _Limnaea peregra_, and _Physa fontinalis_. Near\r\nGothland _Limnaea_ is found in the open sea at 8–12 fath., and with it\r\noccur _Cardium_ and _Tellina_. At the Frisches Haff[21] _Mya arenaria_\r\nis the only marine species, and lives in company with 6 sp. _Limnaea_,\r\n1 _Physa_, 9 _Planorbis_, 1 _Ancylus_, 4 _Valvata_, 2 _Sphaerium_. Were\r\nthe Sound to become closed, and the waters of the Baltic perfectly\r\nfresh, it would be inevitable that _Mya arenaria_, and such other\r\nmarine species as continued to live under their changed conditions,\r\nshould in course of time submit to modifications similar in kind to\r\nthose experienced by the quondam marine species of the Caspian.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable, however, that the origin, at least in a great part,\r\nof the land and fresh-water Mollusca need not be accounted for by such\r\ninvoluntary changes of environment as the enclosure of arms of the sea,\r\nor the possible drying up of inland lakes. These cases may be taken as\r\nillustrations of the much more gradual processes of nature by which the\r\nland and fresh-water fauna must have been developed. The ancestry of\r\nthat fauna must be looked for, as far as the Gasteropoda are concerned,\r\nin _the littoral and estuarine species_; for the Pelecypoda, in _the\r\nestuarine alone_. The effect of the recess of the tide, in the one\r\ncase, and the effect of the reduced percentage of salt, in the other,\r\nhas tended to produce a gradual adaptation to new surroundings, an\r\nadaptation which becomes more and more perfect. It may be safely\r\nasserted that no marine species could pass into a land or fresh-water\r\nspecies except after a period, more or less prolonged, of littoral\r\nor estuarine existence. Thus we find no land or fresh-water species\r\nexhibiting relationships with such deep-sea genera as the _Volutidae_,\r\n_Cancellariidae_, _Terebridae_, or even with genera trenching on the\r\nlowest part of the littoral zone, such as the _Haliotidae_, _Conidae_,\r\n_Olividae_, _Capulidae_. The signs of connexion are rather with the\r\n_Neritidae_, _Cerithiidae_, and above all the _Littorinidae_, which\r\nare accustomed to live for hours, and in the case of _Littorina_ for\r\ndays or even weeks, without being moistened by the tide. Similarly\r\nthe fresh-water Pelecypoda exhibit relationships, not with genera\r\nexclusively marine, but with genera known to inhabit estuaries, such as\r\nthe _Mytilidae_, _Corbulidae_, _Cardiidae_.\r\n\r\nIt would be natural to expect that we should find this process of\r\nconversion still going on, and that we should be able to detect\r\nparticular species or groups of species in process of emigration\r\nfrom sea to land, or from sea to fresh water. Such species will be\r\nintermediate between a marine and a land or fresh-water species, and\r\ndifficult to classify distinctly as one or the other. Cases of Mollusca\r\noccupying this intermediate position occur all over the world. They\r\ninhabit brackish swamps, damp places at high-water mark, and rocks only\r\nat intervals visited by the tide. Such are _Potamides_, _Assiminea_,\r\n_Siphonaria_, _Melampus_, _Hydrobia_, _Truncatella_, among the\r\nunivalves, and many species of _Cyrena_ and _Arca_ among the bivalves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    =Origin of the Fresh-water Fauna=\r\n\r\n(_a_) =Pelecypoda.=--Estuarine species, which have become accustomed to\r\na certain admixture of fresh water, have gradually ascended the streams\r\nor been cut off from the sea, and have at last become habituated to\r\nwater which is perfectly fresh.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8.--=A=, The common _Mytilus edulis_ L.,\r\n  a marine genus and species. =B=, _Dreissensia_, a fresh-water\r\n  genus, closely allied to _Mytilus_.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9.--=A=, _Arca navicella_ Reeve, Philippines,\r\n  a marine species. =B=, _Arca (Scaphula) pinna_ Bens., R.\r\n  Tenasserim, a fresh-water species which lives many miles above\r\n  the tide-way.]\r\n\r\nThus _Dreissensia_ (rivers and canals throughout N. Europe and N.\r\nAmerica) and _Mytilopsis_ (rivers of America) are scarcely modified\r\n_Mytili_ (Fig. 8); _Scaphula_ is a modified _Arca_, and lives in\r\nthe Ganges, the Jumna, and the Tenasserim at a distance of 1600\r\nmiles from the sea (Fig. 9). _Pholas rivicola_ is found imbedded in\r\nfloating wood on the R. Pantai many miles from its mouth. _Cyrena_,\r\n_Corbicula_, and probably _Sphaerium_ and _Pisidium_ are derived, in\r\ndifferent degrees of removal, from the exclusively marine _Veneridae_;\r\n_Potamomya_ (rivers of S. America), and _Himella_ (R. Amazon) are forms\r\nof _Corbula_. The Caspian genera derived from _Cardium_ (_Adacna_,\r\n_Didacna_, _Monodacna_), have already been referred to. _Nausitora_ is\r\na form of _Teredo_, which lives in fresh water in Bengal. _Rangia_,\r\n_Fischeria_, and _Galatea_ probably share the derivation of the\r\nCyrenidae, while in _Iphigenia_ we have one of the Donacidae which\r\nhas not yet mounted rivers, but is confined to a strictly estuarine\r\nlife. The familiar _Scrobicularia piperata_ of our own estuaries is a\r\n_Tellina_, which lives by preference in brackish water.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10.--_Trigonia pectinata_ Lam., Sydney,\r\n  N.S.W.]\r\n\r\nThe great family of the Unionidae is regarded by Neumayr[22] as derived\r\nfrom _Trigonia_, the points of similarity being the development of a\r\nnacreous shell, the presence of a strong epidermis, and the arrangement\r\nof the muscular scars. It is remarkable, too, that on many Uniones of\r\nPliocene times there is found shell ornamentation of such a type as\r\noccurs elsewhere among the Pelecypoda only on _Trigonia_.\r\n\r\nThe genera of fresh-water Pelecypoda are comparatively few in number,\r\nand their origin is far more clearly discernible than that of any other\r\ngroup. This is perhaps due to the fact that the essential changes of\r\nstructure required to convert a marine into a fresh-water bivalve\r\nare but slight. Both animals “breathe water,” and both obtain their\r\nnutriment from matter contained in water. Similar remarks apply to\r\nfresh-water operculate Gasteropoda. But the passage from a marine to an\r\naerial life involves much profounder changes of environment, which have\r\nto be met by correspondingly important changes in the organism. This\r\nmay be in part the reason why the ancestry of all Pulmonata, whether\r\nland or fresh-water, is so difficult to trace.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--=A=, _Cominella_, a marine genus, which\r\n  lives between tide marks, and from which is probably derived =B=,\r\n  _Clea_, a genus occurring only in fresh water.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--=A=, _Cerithium columna_ Sowb.

It is a remarkable fact that in\r\n_Geomelania_ (with its sub-genera _Chittya_ and _Blandiella_) we have\r\na form of _Truncatella_ which has entirely deserted the neighbourhood\r\nof the sea, and lives in woody mountainous localities in certain of\r\nthe West Indies. _Cremnoconchus_, a remarkable shell occurring only on\r\nwet cliffs in the ghâts of southern India, is a modified _Littorina_.\r\n_Neritina_ and _Nerita_ form a very interesting case in illustration\r\nof the whole process. _Nerita_ is a purely marine genus, occurring\r\non rocks in the littoral zone; one species, however, (_N. lineata_,\r\nChem.) ascends rivers as far as 25 miles from their mouth, and others\r\nhaunt marshes of brackish water. _Neritina_ is the fresh-water form,\r\nsome species of which are found in brackish swamps or even creeping on\r\nwet mud between tide marks, while the great majority are fluviatile,\r\none group (_Neritodryas_) actually occurring in the Philippines on\r\ntrees of some height, at a distance of a quarter of a mile from any\r\nwater. _Navicella_ is a still further modified form of _Neritina_,\r\noccurring only on wet rocks, branches, etc., in non-tidal streams (Fig.\r\n13).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Illustrating the development of the\r\n  fresh-water genus _Navicella_, through the brackish-water\r\n  _Neritina_, from the marine _Nerita_, with corresponding changes\r\n  in the operculum. 1. _Nerita_; 2, 3. _Neritina_; 4. _Neritina_,\r\n  intermediate form; 5, 6. _Navicella_.]\r\n\r\nThe great family of the Melaniidae, which occurs in the rivers of warm\r\ncountries all over the world, and that of the Pleuroceridae, which\r\nis confined to North America, are, in all probability, derived from\r\nsome form or forms of _Cerithium_. The origin of the Paludinidae,\r\nValvatidae, and Ampullariidae is more doubtful. Their migration from\r\nthe sea was probably of an early date, since the first traces of all\r\nthree appear in the lower Cretaceous, while Melaniidae are not known\r\nuntil Tertiary times. _Ampullaria_, however, shows distinct signs\r\nof relationship to _Natica_, while the affinities of _Paludina_ and\r\n_Valvata_ cannot as yet be approximately affirmed.\r\n\r\n(2) _Pulmonata._--Intermediate between the essentially fresh-water\r\nand the essentially marine species come the group sometimes known as\r\nGehydrophila, consisting of the two families Auriculidae and Otinidae.\r\nThese may be regarded as Mollusca which, though definitely removed\r\nfrom all marine species by the development of a true lung or lung\r\ncavity in the place of a gill, have yet never become, in respect of\r\nhabitat, genuine fresh-water species. Like _Potamides_, they haunt salt\r\nmarshes, mangrove swamps, and the region about high-water mark. In\r\nsome cases (_Otina_, _Melampus_, _Pedipes_) they live on rocks which\r\nare moistened, or even bathed by the spray, in others (_Cassidula_,\r\n_Auricula_) they are immersed in some depth of brackish water at\r\nhigh tide, in others again (_Scarabus_) they are more definitely\r\nterrestrial, and live under dead leaves in woods at some little\r\ndistance from water. Indeed one genus of diminutive size (_Carychium_)\r\nhas completely abandoned the neighbourhood of the sea, and inhabits\r\nswampy ground almost all over the world.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Examples of the _Auriculidae_: =A=,\r\n  _Auricula Judae_ Lam., Borneo; =B=, _Scarabus Lessoni_ Blainv.,\r\n  E.

Pacific; =E=, _Pedipes\r\n  quadridens_ Pfr., Jamaica.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15.--An example of _Amphibola_ (_avellana_\r\n  Chem.), the only true Pulmonate which possesses an operculum.]\r\n\r\nTo this same section Gehydrophila have been assigned two remarkable\r\nforms of air-breathing “limpet,” _Siphonaria_ and _Gadinia_ (see\r\npage 151), and the aberrant _Amphibola_, a unique instance of a true\r\noperculated pulmonate. _Siphonaria_ possesses a pulmonary cavity\r\nas well as a gill, while _Gadinia_ and _Amphibola_ are exclusively\r\nair-breathing. _Siphonaria_ lives on rocks at or above high-water\r\nmark, _Gadinia_ between tide marks, _Amphibola_ (Fig. 15) in\r\nbrackish water at the estuaries of rivers, half buried in the sand.\r\nThere can be little doubt that all these are marine forms which\r\nare gradually becoming accustomed to a terrestrial existence. In\r\n_Gadinia_ and _Amphibola_ the process is so far complete that they\r\nhave exchanged gills for a pulmonary cavity, while in _Siphonaria_\r\nwe have an intermediate stage in which both organs exist together.\r\nA curious parallel to this is found in the case of _Ampullaria_,\r\nwhich is furnished with two gills and a pulmonary chamber, and\r\nbreathes indifferently air and water. It is a little remarkable that\r\n_Siphonaria_, which lives at a higher tide level than _Gadinia_, should\r\nretain the gill, while _Gadinia_ has lost it.\r\n\r\nThe ultimate affinities of the essentially fresh-water groups,\r\n_Limnaea_, _Physa_, _Chilina_, cannot be precisely affirmed. The\r\nform of shell in _Latia_, _Gundlachia_, and perhaps _Ancylus_, may\r\nsuggest to some a connexion with the Otinidae, and in _Chilina_,\r\na similar connexion with the Auriculidae. But, in a question of\r\nderivation, similarities of shell alone are of little value. It is\r\nnot a little remarkable, for instance, that we should find a simple\r\npatelliform shell in genera so completely distinct from one another\r\nin all anatomical essentials as _Ancylus_, _Patella_, _Siphonaria_,\r\n_Propilidium_, _Hipponyx_, _Cocculina_, and _Umbrella_.\r\n\r\nSome recent authors, on grounds of general organisation, regard the\r\nLimnaeidae and their allies as Opisthobranchs adapted to an aerial\r\nlife. It is held[24] that the Nudibranchiate Opisthobranchs have\r\ngiven birth to the Pulmonata Stylommatophora or land _snails_, and\r\nthe Tectibranchiate Opisthobranchs to the Pulmonata Basommatophora or\r\nfresh-water _snails_. Such a view seems at first sight open to some\r\nobjection from other views than those which deal simply with anatomy.\r\nThe _Opisthobranchiata_ are not, to any marked extent, littoral genera,\r\nnor do they specially haunt the mouths of rivers. On the contrary,\r\nthey inhabit, as a rule, only the very lowest part of the littoral\r\nzone, and are seldom found, except where the water is purely salt.\r\nIn other cases, when the derivation of land or fresh-water genera is\r\nfairly well established, intermediate forms persist, which indicate,\r\nwith more or less clearness, the lines along which modification has\r\nproceeded. It has, however, recently been shown that _Siphonaria_[25]\r\nand _Gadinia_,[26] which have, as has been already mentioned, hitherto\r\nbeen classified as _Pulmonata_, are in reality modified forms of\r\nOpisthobranchiata, which are in process of adaptation to a life partly\r\nmarine, partly on land. They may therefore be regarded as supplying the\r\nlink, hitherto missing, between the land _Pulmonata_ and the marine\r\ngroups from one or other of which the latter must have been derived.\r\nThe general consensus of recent opinion inclines towards accepting\r\nthese views, some writers[27] being content to regard the _Pulmonata_,\r\nas a whole, as derived from the Tectibranchiate Opisthobranchs, while\r\nothers[28] go further and regard the Stylommatophora as derived\r\ndirectly from the Basommatophora.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =Origin of the Land Fauna=\r\n\r\n=Gasteropoda.=--(1) _Operculate._ On _a priori_ grounds, one might\r\npredict a double origin for land operculates. Marine species might\r\nbe imagined to accustom themselves to a terrestrial existence, after\r\na period, more or less prolonged, of littoral probation. Or again,\r\nfresh-water species, themselves ultimately derived from the sea, might\r\nsubmit to a similar transformation, after a preliminary or intermediate\r\nstage of life on mudbanks, wet swamps, branches overhanging the water,\r\netc. Two great families in this group, and two only, seem to have\r\nundergone these transformations, the Littorinidae and the Neritidae.\r\nThe derivation of almost all existing land operculates may be referred\r\nto one or other of these groups.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--Two rows of the radula of _Littorina\r\n  littorea L._, × 72.]\r\n\r\nThe power of the Littorinidae to live for days or even weeks without\r\nbeing moistened by the sea may be verified by the most casual observer.\r\nIn the tropics this power seems even greater than on our own shores. I\r\nhave seen, in various parts of Jamaica, _Littorina muricata_ living at\r\nthe top of low cliffs among grass and herbage. At Panama I have taken\r\nthree large species of _Littorina_ (_varia_, _fasciata_, _pulchra_), on\r\ntrees at and above high-water mark. Cases have been recorded in which\r\na number of _L. muricata_, collected and put aside, have lived for\r\nthree months, and _L. irrorata_ for four months.[29] These facts are\r\nsignificant, when we know that the land operculates almost certainly\r\noriginated in a tropical climate.\r\n\r\nThe Cyclophoridae, Cyclostomatidae, and Aciculidae, which, as\r\ncontrasted with the other land operculates, form one group, have very\r\nclose relations, particularly in the length and formation of the\r\nradula, or lingual ribbon, with the Littorinidae.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Two rows of the radula of _Cyclophorus_\r\n  sp., India, × 40.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Helicinidae, Hydrocenidae, and Proserpinidae are\r\nequally closely related to _Neritina_. The Proserpinidae (restricted\r\nto the Greater Antilles, Central America and Venezuela) may perhaps\r\nbe regarded as the ultimate term of the series. They have lost the\r\ncharacteristic operculum, which in their case is replaced by a number\r\nof folds or lamellae in the interior of the shell. It has already been\r\nnoticed how one group of _Neritina_ (_Neritodryas_) occurs normally\r\nout of the water. This group furnishes a link between the fresh-water\r\nand land forms. It is interesting to notice that here we have the most\r\nperfect sequence of derivatives; _Nerita_ in the main a purely marine\r\nform, with certain species occurring also in brackish water; _Neritina_\r\nin the main fresh-water, but some species occurring on the muddy shore,\r\nothers on dry land; _Helicina_ the developed land form; and finally\r\n_Proserpina_, an aberrant derivative which has lost the operculum.[30]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 18.--=A=, _Neritina reticularis_ Sowb.,\r\n  Calcutta (brackish water); =B=, _Helicina neritella_ Lam.,\r\n  Jamaica (land); =C=, _Proserpina_ (_Ceres_) _eolina_ Ducl.,\r\n  Central America (land).]\r\n\r\n=Gasteropoda.=--(2) _Pulmonata._ The origin of these, the bulk of the\r\nland fauna, must at present be regarded as a problem not yet finally\r\nsolved. Some authorities, as we have seen, regard them as derived\r\nfrom the Nudibranchiate, others, probably more correctly, from the\r\nTectibranchiate Opisthobranchs.\r\n\r\nThe first known members of the land Pulmonata (_Pupa_ [?], _Hyalinia_)\r\nare from the Carboniferous of North America. Similar but new forms\r\nappear in the Cretaceous, from which time to the present we have\r\nan unbroken series. The characteristically modern forms, according\r\nto Simroth,[31] are Helices with thick shells. According to the\r\nsame author, _Vitrina_ and _Hyalinia_ are ancestral types, which\r\ngive origin not only to many modern genera with shells, but to many\r\nshell-less genera also, _e.g._ _Testacella_ is probably derived through\r\n_Daudebardia_ from _Hyalinia_, while from _Vitrina_ came _Limax_ and\r\n_Amalia_. A consideration of the radulae of the genera concerned\r\ncertainly tends in favour of these views.\r\n\r\nGodwin-Austen, speaking generally, considers[32] genera of land\r\nPulmonata with strongly developed mantle-lobes and rudimentary shell as\r\nmore advanced in development than genera in which the shell is large\r\nand covers all or nearly all the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n            LAND AND FRESH-WATER MOLLUSCA, THEIR HABITS AND\r\n                            GENERAL ECONOMY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Land Mollusca are probably more sensitive than is\r\nusually believed. The humidity of the air must affect the surface of\r\ntheir skin to a considerable extent. Every one has noticed how the\r\nsnails ‘come out’ on a damp evening, especially after rain. As a rule,\r\nthey wait till rain is over, probably objecting to the patter of the\r\ndrops upon their delicate tentacles. Snails kept in captivity under\r\na bell-glass are acutely sensitive of a damp atmosphere, and will\r\nbestir themselves after rain just as if they were in the open air.\r\nCertain Helices which are accustomed to live in moist places, will\r\nfind their way to water, if removed from their usual haunts. A case is\r\nrecorded[33] of a specimen of _H. arbustorum_, kept in a kitchen, which\r\nused to find its way directly under the cold water tap, and appeared to\r\nenjoy the luxury of a douche. How delicately the conditions of life are\r\nbalanced in some of these creatures is seen in the case of _Omalonyx_,\r\na genus akin to _Succinea_, which is found in Brazil and the northern\r\nparts of South America. It lives creeping on plants which overhang the\r\nmargin of water, but perishes equally, if placed in the water itself,\r\nor removed to a distance from it for any length of time.[34]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Endurance of Heat and Cold.=--The Mollusca are capable, at least\r\nas far as some species are concerned, of enduring severe extremes\r\nboth of cold and heat. The most northern pulmonate yet observed is\r\na fresh-water species, _Physa_ (_Aplecta_) _hypnorum_ L. This hardy\r\nmollusc, whose shell is so fragile as to need most careful handling,\r\nhas been noticed on the peninsula of Taimyr, North Siberia, in 73° 30’\r\nN. lat, a region whose mean annual temperature is below 10° F. with a\r\nrange of from 40° F. in July to -30° F. in January.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the Limnaeidae, and probably most fresh-water\r\nMollusca of sub-temperate regions, can continue to live not merely\r\nunder, but enveloped in ice, and themselves frozen hard. Garnier\r\nrelates[35] that, during the winter of 1829–30, some large _Limnaea\r\nauricularia_, which had been placed in a small basin, were frozen into\r\na solid mass, experiencing a cold of -2° F. He supposed they were dead,\r\nbut, to his surprise, when the basin thawed, the Limnaea gradually\r\nrevived. _Paludina vivipara_ and _Anodonta anatina_ have been known\r\nto resist a temperature of 23° F., and the former has produced young\r\nshortly after being thawed out of the ice.[36] As far north as Bodø in\r\nNorway (67° 37’ N. lat., well within the Arctic circle) there are found\r\nno less than fourteen species of terrestrial Mollusca, among them being\r\n_Balea perversa_ and _Clausilia rugosa_.[37]\r\n\r\n_Vitrina_ is one of our most hardy molluscs, and may be observed\r\ncrawling on bright mornings over the frost-covered leaves of a wood or\r\ncopse. _V. glacialis_ is said by Charpentier to live in the Alps at a\r\nheight where the stones are covered with snow from nine to ten months\r\nof the year. Many of the _Hyaliniae_ are very hardy. _Arion_, in spite\r\nof having no external shell to protect it, is apparently less affected\r\nby the cold than _Helix_, and does not commence hibernation till a\r\nlater period in the autumn. The operculate land Mollusca, in spite of\r\nthe protection which their operculum may be supposed to afford, are\r\nexceedingly sensitive to cold, and the whole group is without doubt a\r\nproduct of tropical or semi-tropical regions (see map at frontispiece).\r\nA species of _Helicina_ which inhabits the southern States of North\r\nAmerica has been known to be almost exterminated from certain districts\r\nby the occurrence of an unusually severe winter.\r\n\r\nOne of the highest altitudes at which a land shell is known to live\r\nappears to be the Liti Pass (Himalayas, 14,000 ft.). At this enormous\r\naltitude, two species of _Buliminus_ (_arcuatus_ Hutt. and _nivicola_\r\nBens.) live on juniper bushes among patches of snow. An _Anadenus_ is\r\nsaid to have been found in a similar locality at 15,000 ft., while\r\n_Limnaea Hookeri_ has been taken from over 16,400 ft. in Landour. In\r\nthe Andes of Peru and Bolivia, five species of _Bulimulus_, one of\r\n_Pupa_, and one of _Limax_ occur at an elevation of 10,500 to 15,000\r\nft. Several fresh-water Mollusca inhabit Lake Titicaca, which stands at\r\na height of 12,550 ft. in the Bolivian table-land.\r\n\r\nIn certain parts of the desert of Algeria, where there is not a trace\r\nof vegetation to be seen, and the temperature at mid-day is 110° F.,\r\nthe ground is sometimes so covered with _Helix lactea_ as to appear\r\nperfectly white. Dr. F. H. H. Guillemard has told me that he noticed,\r\nin somewhat similar surroundings between Fez and Tangier, _H. pisana_\r\nin such extraordinary abundance that they hung from the low scrub in\r\nbunches the size of a man’s two fists. It is singular that Mollusca\r\nshould live, and not only live, but flourish, in localities apparently\r\nso unpromising. Shells which occur in the Algerian Sahara are actually\r\nlarger and altogether finer than the ordinary European form of the\r\nsame species. In order to protect themselves to some extent against\r\nthe scorching heat and consequent evaporation, desert species are\r\nfrequently modified in one of two ways; the shell becomes either white\r\nor a light dusky brown, as in the familiar _Helix desertorum_, or else\r\nit gains immensely in thickness. Specimens of _H. pomatia_, recently\r\nprocured from Fez, are of extraordinary thickness as compared with\r\nforms from our own chalk downs of Kent and Surrey.\r\n\r\nFresh-water Mollusca are frequently found inhabiting hot springs. Thus\r\n_Neritina fluviatilis_ lives at Bagnères de Bigorre in water at about\r\n68° F. In another hot spring in the eastern Pyrenees a _Bithynia_ lives\r\nat a temperature of over 73° F.; while Blainville mentions another case\r\nof a _Bithynia_ living in water at 122° F.\r\n\r\n=Hibernation and Aestivation.=--As autumn begins to draw on, and the\r\nfirst frosts to nip vegetation, terrestrial species retire beneath\r\nstones, into cracks in old walls, holes in tree trunks, deep fissures\r\nin rocks, and nooks and crannies of every kind, or else bury themselves\r\ndeeply in the earth or in moss and heaps of leaves. They thus commence\r\ntheir period of _hibernation_, which varies in length according to\r\nthe duration of winter. Frequently masses of Helices may be found\r\nattached to one another, probably not so much for the sake of warmth,\r\nfor their temperature is but low, as to share the comforts of a cosy\r\nretreat in common. Slugs generally hibernate alone, excavating a sort\r\nof nest in the earth, in which they encyst themselves, contracting\r\ntheir bodies until they are almost round, and secreting a covering of\r\ntheir own slime. The Helices usually close up the mouth of their shell\r\nby the formation of a membranous or chalky _epiphragm_, which will be\r\nfurther described below. Both snails and slugs take care to be in good\r\ncondition at the time their winter sleep begins, and for this reason\r\nthe former are said to be most esteemed by foreign epicures if captured\r\njust at this period.[38]\r\n\r\nDuring hibernation, the action of the heart in land Pulmonata ceases\r\nalmost entirely. This appears to be directly due to the effect of cold.\r\nMr. C. Ashford has related[39] some interesting experiments made upon\r\n_H. hortensis_ and _Hyal. cellaria_, with the view of ascertaining the\r\neffect of cold upon their pulsations. His observations may be tabulated\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n       Number of pulsations per minute\r\n    _Helix hortensis_   _Hyal. cellaria_   At degrees Fahr.\r\n            22                 21                52°\r\n            14                 12                44°\r\n            10                 11                38°\r\n             4                  9                30°\r\n\r\nAt low temperatures the character, as well as the number of the\r\npulsations changed; they became imperfect and intermittent, although\r\nexceptionally at 31° F. a _H. rufescens_ gave five or six pulsations a\r\nminute, very full and deliberate. The result of taking the _Hyalinia_\r\nsuddenly into the heat of a greenhouse was to bring on palpitations.\r\nFurther experiments resulted in evidence of a similar kind. _Hyal.\r\nradiatula_, placed upon a deal table in a room, showed 52 pulsations\r\nper minute at 62° F. Placed upon the palm of the hand, the action\r\nsoon rose to 108. _Hyal. alliaria_, similarly treated, rose from 72\r\npulsations to 110. Floated upon water, the action of the heart of the\r\nlatter suddenly fell to 29.\r\n\r\nFresh-water Pulmonata do not appear to hibernate. _Unio_ and\r\n_Anodonta_, however, bury themselves more deeply in the mud, and\r\n_Dreissensia_ casts off its byssus and retires under the mud in deeper\r\nwater.[40] _Limnaea_ and _Planorbis_ have often been noticed to crawl\r\nabout under the lower surface of a thick coating of ice. In periods of\r\nprolonged drought, when the water in the ponds dries up, the majority\r\nof genera bury themselves in the mud. I have known _Limnaea peregra_\r\nbury itself three inches deep, when surprised by a sudden fall of the\r\nwater in the ditch on Coe Fen, behind Peterhouse, Cambridge. _Physa\r\nhypnorum_ frequents by preference ditches which dry up in summer, as\r\ndoes also _Planorbis spirorbis_, the latter often forming a sort of\r\nepiphragm against evaporation. _Ancylus_ has been observed to spend the\r\nwhole winter out of water, and _P. spirorbis_ has been noticed alive\r\nafter four months’ desiccation.[41]\r\n\r\nTrue aestivation, however, occurs mainly in the tropics, where there is\r\nno winter, but only a period when it is not quite so hot as the rest\r\nof the year, or on a coast like the Mediterranean, which is subject to\r\nsudden and severe heat. This period is usually rainless, and the heat\r\nis therefore a dry heat. At this season, which may last for three or\r\nfour months, most of the land Mollusca enter upon a period of inaction,\r\neither burying themselves deeply in the ground, or else permanently\r\nattaching themselves to the stalks of grass and other herbage, or the\r\nunder sides of rocks. For instance, the large and beautifully painted\r\n_Orthalicus_, _Corona_, and _Porphyrobaphe_, which inhabit Brazil,\r\nEcuador, and eastern Peru, bury themselves deeply in the ground during\r\nthe dry season, while in the rains they climb to the topmost branches\r\nof the great forest trees.[42] Thus it may well happen that a visitor\r\nto a tropical island, Ceylon for instance, or one of the Greater\r\nAntilles, if he times his visit to coincide with the rainless season,\r\nmay be grievously disappointed at what seems its unaccountable poverty\r\nin land Mollusca. But as soon as the weather breaks, and the moisture\r\npenetrates their retreats, every bush and every stone, in favoured\r\nlocalities, will be alive with interesting species.\r\n\r\n=The Epiphragm.=--A considerable number of the land Pulmonata (and\r\na very few of the fresh-water) possess the power of closing the\r\naperture of their shell by means of what is known as an _epiphragm_\r\nor covering of hardened mucus. This epiphragm is habitually formed by\r\ncertain species during hibernation or aestivation, or even during\r\nshorter periods of inactivity and retirement, the object being, either\r\nto check evaporation of the moisture of the body, or to secure the\r\nanimal against the cold by retaining a thin layer of slightly warm air\r\nimmediately within the aperture of the shell.\r\n\r\nThe epiphragm differs widely in character in different species,\r\nsometimes (_Clausilia_, _Pupa_, _Planorbis_) consisting of the merest\r\npellicle of transparent membrane, while at others (_Helix aperta_,\r\n_H. pomatia_) it is a thick chalky substance, with a considerable\r\nadmixture of carbonate of lime, with the consistency of a hardened\r\nlayer of plaster of Paris. Within these extremes every variety of\r\nthickness, solidity, and transparency occurs. During long hibernation\r\nseveral epiphragms are not unfrequently formed by the same individual\r\nsnail, one within the other, at gradually lessening distances. The\r\nepiphragm thus performs, to a certain extent, the part of an operculum,\r\nbut it must be remembered that it differs radically from an operculum\r\nphysiologically, in being only a temporary secretion, while the\r\noperculum is actually a living part of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe actual mode of formation of the epiphragm would seem to differ in\r\ndifferent species. According to Fischer,[43] the mollusc withdraws into\r\nits shell, completely blocking all passage of air into the interior,\r\nand closing the pulmonary orifice. Then, from the middle part of the\r\nfoot, which is held exactly at the same plane as the aperture, is\r\nslowly secreted a transparent pellicle, which gradually thickens,\r\nand in certain species becomes calcareous. Dr. Binney, who kept a\r\nlarge number of _Helix hortensis_ in confinement, had frequently\r\nan opportunity of noticing the manner in which the epiphragm was\r\nformed.[44] The aperture of the shell being upward, and the collar\r\nof the animal having been brought to a level with it, a quantity of\r\ngelatinous matter is thrown out [? where from]. The pulmonary orifice\r\nis then opened, and a portion of the air within suddenly ejected, with\r\nsuch force as to separate the viscid matter from the collar, and to\r\nproject it, like a bubble of air, from the aperture. The animal then\r\nquickly withdraws farther into the shell, and the pressure of the\r\nexternal air forces back the vesicle to a level with the aperture,\r\nwhen it hardens and forms the epiphragm. In some of the European\r\nspecies in which the gelatinous secretion contains more carbonate of\r\nlime, solidification seems to take place at the moment when the air is\r\nexpelled, and the epiphragm in these is in consequence strongly convex.\r\n\r\n=Thread-spinning.=--A considerable number of fresh-water Mollusca\r\npossess the power of stretching a thread, which is no more than an\r\nexceedingly elongated piece of mucus, to the surface of the water, and\r\nof using it as a means of locomotion. This thread bears no analogy\r\nwhatever to the fibrous byssus of certain bivalves, being formed in an\r\nentirely different manner, without the need of a special gland.\r\n\r\nThe threads are ‘spun’ by several species of _Limnaea_, _Physa_,\r\nand _Planorbis_, by _Bithynia tentaculata_, and several of the\r\n_Cycladidae_. They are anchored to the surface by a minute concavity at\r\nthe upper end, which appears to act like a small boat in keeping the\r\nthread steady. The longest threads are those of the _Physae_, which\r\nhave been noticed to attain a length, in confinement, of 14 inches.\r\nThey are always spun in the ascent, and as a rule, when the animal\r\ndescends, it rolls the thread up and carries it down as it goes. A\r\nsingle thread is never spun on the descent, but occasionally, when a\r\nthread has become more or less of a permanence, it becomes stronger by\r\nthe addition of more mucus each time it is used, whether for ascending\r\nor descending purposes. _Cyclas cornea_ appears to be an exception to\r\nthe rule that threads are only spun on the ascent. This species, which\r\nis particularly fond of crawling along the under surface of the water,\r\nhas been noticed to spin a thread half an inch in length while on the\r\nsurface, and to hang suspended from it for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nWhat the exact use of the thread may be, must to a certain extent\r\nbe matter of conjecture. The Limnaeidae are, in the great majority\r\nof cases, compelled to make periodic visits to the surface in order\r\nto inspire oxygen. It is also a favourite habit with them to float\r\njust under the surface, or crawl about on its under side, perhaps in\r\npursuit of tiny vegetable organisms. Whatever may be the object of an\r\nexcursion to the surface, a taut thread will obviously be a nearer way\r\nup than any other which is likely to present itself; indeed, without\r\nthis thread-spinning power, which insures a tolerably rapid arrival at\r\nthe surface, the animal might find itself asphyxiated, or at least\r\nseriously inconvenienced, before it could succeed in taking in the\r\ndesired supply of oxygen. With the Cycladidae, which do not breathe\r\nair, such an explanation is out of place; in their case the thread\r\nseems to be a convenient means of resting in one position in the\r\nintervals of the periods of active exercise to which several of the\r\nspecies are so much addicted.\r\n\r\nThe power of suspension by a thread is also possessed by certain of\r\nthe _Cyclostomatidae_, by some _Cerithidea_, several _Rissoa_ and\r\nother marine genera, prominent among which is _Litiopa bombyx_, whose\r\nname expresses its power of anchoring itself to the Sargasso weed by a\r\nsilken thread of mucus. Several species of slugs are known to be able\r\nto let themselves down by threads from the branches of trees. _Limax\r\narborum_ is especially noted for this property, and has been observed\r\nsuspended in pairs during the breeding time. According to Binney, all\r\nthe American species of _Limax_, besides those of _Tebennophorus_,\r\npossess this singular property. _Limax arborum_ appears to be the only\r\nslug which has been noticed to ascend, as well as descend, its thread.\r\nIt has also been observed[45] that when this species is gorged with\r\nfood, its slime is thin and watery, and unable to sustain its weight,\r\nbut that after the process of digestion has been performed, the mucus\r\nagain becomes thick and tenacious. It appears therefore that when\r\nthe animal is hungry and most in need of the power of making distant\r\nexcursions in search of food, its condition enables it to do so, but\r\nthat when no such necessity is pressing, the thread-forming mucus is\r\nnot secreted, or is perhaps held in suspense while the glands assist in\r\nlubricating the food before digestion.[46]\r\n\r\n=Food of Land and Fresh-water Mollusca.=--_Arion ater_, the great black\r\nslug, although normally frugivorous, is unquestionably carnivorous\r\nas well, feeding on all sorts of animal matter, whether decaying,\r\nfreshly killed, or even in a living state. It is frequently noticed\r\nfeeding on earthworms; kept in captivity, it will eat raw beef; it does\r\nnot disdain the carcases of its own dead brethren. An old man near\r\nBerwick-on-Tweed, going out one morning to mow grass, found a black\r\nslug devouring, as he supposed, a dead mouse. Being of an inquisitive\r\nturn, and wishing to ascertain if it were really thus engaged, he drew\r\nthe mouse a little back. When he returned in the evening, the mouse was\r\nreduced almost to a skeleton, and the slug was still there.[47] Indeed\r\nit would seem almost difficult to name anything which _Arion ater_ will\r\nnot eat. Dr. Gray mentions[48] a case of a specimen which devoured\r\nsand recently taken from the beach, which contained just enough animal\r\nmatter to render it luminous when trodden on in the dark; after a\r\nlittle time the faeces of the slug were composed of pure sand, united\r\ntogether by a little mucus. A specimen kept two days in captivity was\r\nturned out on a newspaper, and commenced at once to devour it. The same\r\nspecimen ate dead bodies of five other species of slugs, a dead _Unio_,\r\npupae of _Adimonia tanaceti_, part of the abdomen of a dragon-fly, and\r\nPears’ soap, the latter reluctantly.[49]\r\n\r\nAccording to Simroth[50] and Scharff[51] the food of several of our\r\nBritish slugs, _e.g._ _Limax maximus_, _L. flavus_, _Arion subfuscus_,\r\n_A. intermedius_, consists of non-chlorophyllaceous substances only,\r\nwhile anything containing chlorophyll is as a rule refused. On the\r\nother hand _L. agrestis_ and _Amalia carinata_ feed almost entirely on\r\ngreen food, and are most destructive in gardens. The latter species\r\nlives several inches under ground during the day, and comes to the\r\nsurface only at night. It is largely responsible for the disappearance\r\nof bulbs, to which it is extremely partial. _L. marginatus_ (=\r\n_arborum_ Bouch.) feeds exclusively on lichens, and in captivity\r\nabsolutely refuses green leaves and a flesh diet. It follows therefore,\r\nif these observations are correct, that the popular notions about slugs\r\nmust be revised, and that while we continue to exterminate from our\r\ngardens those species which have a taste for chlorophyll, we ought\r\nto spare, if not encourage those whose tastes lie in the opposite\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n_Limax agrestis_ has been seen devouring the crushed remains of _Arion\r\nater_. Five specimens of the same species were once noticed busily\r\ndevouring a May-fly each, and this in the middle of a large meadow,\r\nwhere it may be presumed there was no lack of green food. The capture\r\nand eating of insects by Mollusca seems very remarkable, but this\r\nstory does not stand alone. Mr. T. Vernon Wollaston once enclosed in\r\na bottle at least three dozen specimens of Coleoptera together with\r\n4 _Helix cantiana_, 5 _H. hispida_, and 1 _H. virgata_, together\r\nwith an abundant supply of fresh leaves and grass. About a fortnight\r\nafterwards, on the bottle being opened, it was found that every single\r\nspecimen of the Coleoptera had been devoured by the snails.[52] _Amalia\r\nmarginata_ in captivity has been fed upon the larvae of _Euchelia\r\njacobaeae_, eating three in two hours.[53]\r\n\r\n_Limax maximus_ (Fig. 19) has been seen frequently to make its way into\r\na dairy and feed on raw beef.[54] Individuals kept in confinement are\r\nguilty of cannibalism. Mr. W. A. Gain kept three specimens in a box\r\ntogether, and found one of them two-thirds eaten, “the tail left clean\r\ncut off, reminding one of that portion of a fish on a fishmonger’s\r\nstall.” That starvation did not prompt the crime was proved by the\r\nfact that during the preceding night the slug had been supplied with,\r\nand had eaten, a considerable quantity of its favourite food. On two\r\nother occasions the same observer found one of his slugs deprived of\r\nits slime and a portion of its skin, and in a dying condition.[55] An\r\nadult _L. maximus_, kept for thirty-three days in captivity with a\r\nyoung _Arion ater_, attacked it frequently, denuded it of its slime,\r\nand gnawed numerous small pieces of skin off the body and mantle.[56]\r\nThe present writer has found no better bait for this species on a warm\r\nsummer night than the bodies of its brethren which were slain on the\r\nnight preceding; it will also devour dead _Helix aspersa_. Mr. Gain\r\nconsiders it a very dainty feeder, preferring fungi to all other foods,\r\nand apparently doing no harm in the garden.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19.--_Limax maximus_ L. =PO=, pulmonary\r\n  orifice: × ⅔.]\r\n\r\n_Limax flavus_, which is fond of inhabiting the vicinity of cellars,\r\nmakes its presence most disagreeable by attacking articles of food,\r\nand especially by insinuating itself into vessels containing meal and\r\nflour.[57] It is particularly partial to cream.\r\n\r\nSlugs will sometimes bite their captor’s hands. Mr. Kew relates\r\nthat a _Limax agrestis_, on being stopped with the finger, while\r\nendeavouring to escape from the attack of a large _Arion_, attempted\r\nto bite fiercely, the rasping action of its radula being plainly felt.\r\nAccording to the same authority, probably all the slugs will rasp the\r\nskin of the finger, if it is held out to them, and continue to do so\r\nfor a considerable time, without however actually drawing blood.[58]\r\nWhile Mr. Gain was handling a large _Arion ater_, it at once seized one\r\nof the folds of skin between the fingers of the hand on which it was\r\nplaced; after the action of the radula had been allowed to continue for\r\nabout a minute, the skin was seen to be abraded.[59] Another specimen\r\nof _Arion ater_, carried in the hand for a long time enclosed in a\r\ndock leaf, began to rasp the skin. The operation was permitted until\r\nit became too painful to bear. Examination with a lens showed the skin\r\nalmost rasped away, and the place remained tender and sore, like a\r\nslight burn, for several days.[60]\r\n\r\n_Helix pisana_, if freshly caught, and placed in a box with other\r\nspecies, will set to work and devour them within twenty-four hours.\r\nThe present writer has noticed it, in this position, attack and kill\r\nlarge specimens of _H. ericetorum_, cleaning them completely out, and\r\ninserting its elongated body into the top whorls of its unfortunate\r\nvictims in a most remarkable manner. Amongst a large number of species\r\nbred in captivity by Miss F. M. Hele,[61] was _Hyalinia Draparnaldi_.\r\nIn the first summer the young offspring were fed on cabbage, coltsfoot,\r\nand broadleafed docks. They would not hibernate even in the severest\r\nfrosts, and, no outdoor food being available, were fed on chopped beef.\r\nThis, Miss Hele thinks, must have degenerated their appetites, for in\r\nthe following spring and summer they constantly devoured each other.\r\n\r\n_Zonites algirus_ feeds on decayed fruit and vegetables, and on\r\nstinking flesh.[62] _Achatina panthera_ has been known to eat meat,\r\nother snails (when dead), vegetables, and paper.[63] The common\r\n_Stenogyra decollata_ of the South of Europe has a very bad character\r\nfor flesh-eating habits, when kept in captivity. Mr. Binney[64] kept\r\na number for a long time as scavengers, to clean the shells of other\r\nsnails. As soon as a living _Helix_ was placed in a box with them, one\r\nwould attack it, introduce itself into the upper whorls, and completely\r\nremove the animal. One day a number of _Succinea ovalis_ were left\r\nwith them for a short time, and disappeared entirely! The _Stenogyra_\r\nhad eaten shell as well as animal. This view of _Stenogyra_ is quite\r\nconfirmed by Miss Hele, who has bred them in thousands. “I can keep,”\r\nshe writes,[65] “no small _Helix_ or _Bulimus_ with them, for they at\r\nonce kill and eat them. They will also eat raw meat.”\r\n\r\nEven the common _Limnaea stagnalis_, which is usually regarded as\r\nstrictly herbivorous, will sometimes betake itself, apparently by\r\npreference, to a diet of flesh. Karl Semper frequently observed the\r\nLimnaeae in his aquarium suddenly attack healthy living specimens of\r\nthe common large water newt (_Triton taeniatus_), overcome them, and\r\ndevour them, although there was plenty of their favourite vegetable\r\nfood growing within easy reach.[66] The same species has also been\r\nnoticed to devour its own ova, and the larvae of _Dytiscus_. _Limnaea\r\nperegra_ has been detected capturing and partially devouring minnows\r\nin an aquarium, when deprived of other food, and Dr. Jeffreys has seen\r\nthe same species attack its own relatives under similar circumstances,\r\npiercing the spire at its thinnest point near to the apex.[67] _L.\r\nstagnalis_, kept in an aquarium, has succeeded in overpowering and\r\npartially devouring healthy specimens of the common stickleback.[68]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Powers of Intelligence, Homing, and finding Food.=--It is not easy to\r\ndiscover whether land Mollusca possess any faculties which correspond\r\nto what we call intelligence, as distinct from their capacities for\r\nsmell, sight, taste, and hearing. Darwin mentions[69] a remarkable\r\ncase, communicated to him by Mr. Lonsdale. A couple of _Helix pomatia_,\r\none of which was sickly, were placed in a small and ill-provided\r\ngarden. The stronger of the two soon disappeared over the wall into\r\nthe next garden, which was well furnished with food. It was concluded\r\nthat the snail had deserted its weakly mate, but after twenty-four\r\nhours it returned, and apparently communicated the results of its\r\nexpedition, for after a short time both started off along the same\r\ntrack, and disappeared over the wall. According to Dr. W. H. Dall,[70]\r\na young girl who possessed a remarkable power over animals succeeded\r\nin training a snail (_H. albolabris_) to come out of its lurking-place\r\nat her call. If placed in a room, it would shrink into its shell at\r\nthe sound of any other voice, but it would always start off in the\r\ndirection of hers.\r\n\r\nSnails and slugs possess to a considerable extent the faculty of\r\n‘homing,’ or returning to the same hiding-place day after day, after\r\ntheir night excursions in search of food. Mr. C. Ashford once marked\r\nwith a dab of white paint seven _Helix aspersa_ found lurking under a\r\nbroken flagstone; at 10 P.M. the same evening three had disappeared\r\non the forage; the next morning all were ‘at home.’ The following\r\nnight at 10 P.M. five were gone out, two being discovered with some\r\ndifficulty ‘in a small jungle’ six feet away; the next morning six\r\nout of the seven were safely beneath the flagstone. According to the\r\nsame authority, _Helix aspersa_ will find its way across a cinder-path\r\n(which it specially detests) to get to its favourite food, and will\r\nreturn by the same way to its old quarters, although it could easily\r\nhave found new lodgings nearer the food-supply. A snail has been\r\nobserved to occupy a hole in the brick wall of a kitchen-garden about\r\nfour feet from the ground. Leaning against the wall, and immediately\r\nunder the hole, was a piece of wood, the lower end of which rested in\r\na bed of herbs. For months the snail employed this ladder between its\r\nfood and its home, coming down as soon as it was dark, and retiring to\r\nrest during the day.\r\n\r\nIn greenhouses a slug will forage night after night--as gardeners know\r\nto their cost--over the same beat, and will always return to the same\r\nhiding-place. _Limax flavus_ has been noticed crawling with great\r\nregularity to a sink from a hole near the water-pipe, and keeping to\r\na well-marked circular track. In all probability the scent, either of\r\nthe desired object of food, or of the creature’s own trail, plays\r\na considerable part in keeping it to the same outward and homeward\r\ntrack, or at least in guiding it back to its hiding-place. Yet even\r\nscent is occasionally at fault, for on one occasion a _Limax flavus_\r\nwas accustomed to make nightly excursions to some basins of cream,\r\nwhich were kept in a cool cellar. When the basins were removed to a\r\ndistant shelf, the creature was found the next morning ‘wandering\r\ndisconsolately’ about in the place where the basins had formerly\r\nstood.[71]\r\n\r\nA remarkable case of the power of smell, combined with great\r\nperseverance on the part of a _Helix_, is recorded by Furtado.[72] He\r\nnoticed a _Helix aspersa_ lodged between a column on a verandah and a\r\nflower-pot containing a young banana plant, and threw it away into a\r\nlittle court below, and six or seven yards distant. Next morning the\r\nsnail was in precisely the same place on the flower-pot. Again he threw\r\nit away, to the same distance, and determined to notice what happened.\r\nNext morning at nine o’clock, the snail was resting on the rail of a\r\nstaircase leading up to the verandah from the court; in the evening\r\nit started again, quickening its space as it advanced, eventually\r\nattacking the banana in precisely the same place where it had been\r\ngnawed before.\r\n\r\nFor further instances of the power of smell in snails, see chap. vii.\r\n\r\nSlugs have been known to make their way into bee-hives, presumably\r\nfor the sake of the honey.[73] ‘Sugaring’ the trees at night for\r\nmoths will often attract a surprising concourse of slugs. Sometimes a\r\nparticular plant in a greenhouse will become the object of the slugs’\r\npersistent attacks, and they will neglect every other food in order\r\nto obtain it. _Farfugium grande_ is one of these favourite foods,\r\n“the young leaves and shoots being always eaten in preference to all\r\nother plants growing in the houses; where no _Farfugiums_ were kept\r\nthe slugs nibbled indiscriminately at many kinds.”[74] The flowers\r\nof orchidaceous plants exercise a special attraction over slugs,\r\nwhich appear to have some means of discovering when the plants are in\r\nbloom. “I have often observed,” says Mr. T. Baines, “that a slug will\r\ntravel over the surface of a pot in which is growing a _Dendrobium\r\nnobile_, a _Cattleya_, _Vanda_, or similar upright plant for a score\r\nof times without ever attempting to ascend into the head of the plant\r\nunless it is in bloom, in which case they are certain to find their\r\nway straight to the flowers; after which they will descend, and\r\nreturn to some favourite hiding-place, often at the opposite end of\r\nthe house.”[75] Mr. R. Warner has “actually seen many little slugs\r\nsuspending themselves by slime-threads from the rafters and descending\r\non the spikes of the beautiful _Odontoglossum alexandrae_; and thus\r\nmany spikes, thickly wadded round with cotton wool (which the slugs\r\ncould not travel over), and growing in pots surrounded by water, had\r\nbeen lost.”[76] Perhaps the most singular instance of a liking for\r\na particular food is that related by Mr. E. Step.[77] In a London\r\npublishing house, slugs were observed, during a period of nearly twelve\r\nmonths, to have fed almost nightly on the colouring matter in certain\r\nbookcovers, and though the trails were often seen over the shelves,\r\nand cabbage and lettuce leaves laid down to tempt the creatures, they\r\ncontinued their depredations with impunity for the time above mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Limnaea peregra_ has been observed feeding on old fish-heads thrown\r\ninto a dirty stream, and a large gathering of _Limnaea stagnalis_ has\r\nbeen noticed feeding upon an old newspaper in a pond on Chislehurst\r\nCommon, ‘so that for the space of about a square foot nothing else\r\ncould be seen.’[78]\r\n\r\n=Tenacity of Life.=--Land Mollusca have been known to exhibit, under\r\nunusual conditions, remarkable tenacity of life. Some of the most\r\nnoteworthy and best authenticated instances of this faculty may be here\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe well-known story of the British Museum snail is thus related by Mr.\r\nBaird.[79] On the 25th March 1846 two specimens of _Helix desertorum_,\r\ncollected by Charles Lamb, Esq., in Egypt some time previously, were\r\nfixed upon tablets and placed in the collection among the other\r\nMollusca of the Museum. There they remained fast gummed to the tablet.\r\nAbout the 15th March 1850, having occasion to examine some shells in\r\nthe same case, Mr. Baird noticed a recently formed epiphragm over the\r\nmouth of one of these snails. On removing the snails from the tablet\r\nand placing them in tepid water, one of them came out of its shell, and\r\nthe next day ate some cabbage leaf. A month or two afterwards it began\r\nrepairing the lip of its shell, which was broken when it was first\r\naffixed to the tablet.\r\n\r\nWhile resident in Porto Santo, from 27th April to 4th May 1848, Mr.\r\nS. P. Woodward[80] collected a number of Helices and sorted them out\r\ninto separate pill-boxes. On returning home, these boxes were placed in\r\nempty drawers in an insect cabinet, and on 19th October 1850, nearly\r\ntwo and a half years afterwards, many of them were found to be still\r\nalive. A whole bagful of _H. turricula_, collected on the Ilheo de Cima\r\non 24th April 1849, were all alive at the above-mentioned date.\r\n\r\nIn September 1858 Mr. Bryce Wright sent[81] to the British Museum two\r\nspecimens of _H. desertorum_ which had been dormant for four years.\r\nThey were originally collected in Egypt by a Mr. Vernèdi, who, in May\r\n1854, while stopping at one of the stations in the desert, found a\r\nheap of thorn-bushes lying in a corner of the building, rather thickly\r\nstudded with the snails. He picked off fifteen or twenty specimens,\r\nwhich he carried home and locked up in a drawer, where they remained\r\nundisturbed until he gave two to Mr. Wright in September 1858.\r\n\r\nIn June 1855 Dr. Woodward placed specimens of _H. candidissima_ and _H.\r\naperta_ in a glass box, to test their tenacity of life; he writes of\r\ntheir being still alive in April 1859.\r\n\r\nMr. R. E. C. Stearns records[82] a case of _Buliminus pallidior_ and\r\n_H. Veatchii_ from Cerros I. living without food from 1859 to March\r\n1865.\r\n\r\nH. Aucapitaine mentions[83] a case of _H. lactea_ found in calcinated\r\nground in a part of the Sahara heated to 122° F., where no rain was\r\nsaid to have fallen for five years. The specimen revived after being\r\nenclosed in a bottle for three and a half years.\r\n\r\nIn August 1863, Mr. W. J. Sterland[84] put specimens of _H. nemoralis_\r\nin a box and afterwards placed the box in his cabinet; in November 1866\r\none specimen was discovered to be alive.\r\n\r\nGaskoin relates[85] a case in which specimens of _H. lactea_ were\r\npurchased from a dealer in whose drawer they had been for two years.\r\nThis dealer had them from a merchant at Mogador, who had kept them for\r\nmore than that time under similar conditions. One of these shells on\r\nbeing immersed in water revived, and in April 1849 was placed quite\r\nalone under a bell jar with earth and food. In the end of the following\r\nOctober about thirty young _H. lactea_ were found crawling on the glass.\r\n\r\nMr. R. D. Darbishire bought[86] some _H. aperta_ in the market at Nice\r\non 18th February 1885. Two specimens of these, placed with wool in a\r\npaper box, were alive in December 1888. This is a very remarkable case,\r\n_H. aperta_ not being, like _H. desertorum_, _H. lactea_, _H. Veatchii_\r\nand _Bul. pallidior_, a desert snail, and therefore not accustomed to\r\nfasting at all.\r\n\r\n=Age of Snails.=--It would appear, from the existing evidence, which\r\nis not too plentiful, that five years is about the average age of\r\nthe common garden snail. Mr. Gain has published[87] some interesting\r\nobservations on the life of a specimen from the cradle to the grave,\r\nwhich may be exhibited in a tabular form.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 1882.        Eggs hatched; one attained diameter of ⅜ in.\r\n                        before winter; fed on coltsfoot and cabbage.\r\n\r\n    5th Oct. 1883.    Shell 1 in. in diameter, no lip formed.\r\n\r\n    July 1884.        Shell finished; diameter 1⅛ in., including\r\n                        perfect lip.\r\n\r\n    3rd May 1885.     Left winter quarters; companion introduced,\r\n                        with which it was seen in company on 5th\r\n                        August.\r\n\r\n    9th Aug.  „       Laid eggs in soil, which were hatched on\r\n                        10th September, and feeding on 17th September;\r\n                        in May 1886 the largest of these\r\n                        was 11/16 in. diameter.\r\n\r\n    13th Oct. 1887.   Old snail died, aged 5 years 2 months.\r\n\r\nAccording to Clessin, the duration of life in _Vitrina_ is one year,\r\n_Cyclas_ 2 years; _Hyalinia_, _Succinea_, _Limnaea_, _Planorbis_, and\r\n_Ancylus_ are full grown in 2 to 3 years, _Helix_ and _Paludina_ in 2\r\nto 4, and _Anodonta_ in 12 to 14. Hazay finds[88] that the duration of\r\nlife in _Hyalinia_ is 2 years, in _Helix pomatia_ 6 to 8, in _Helix\r\ncandicans_ 2 to 3, in _Paludina_ 8 to 10, in _Limnaea_ and _Planorbis_\r\n3 to 4.\r\n\r\n=Growth of the Shell.=--Mr. E. J. Lowe, many years ago, conducted[89]\r\nsome interesting experiments on the growth of snails. The facts arrived\r\nat were--\r\n\r\n(1) The shells of Helicidae increase but little for a considerable\r\nperiod, never arriving at maturity before the animal has _once_\r\nbecome dormant.\r\n\r\n(2) Shells do not grow whilst the animal itself remains dormant.\r\n\r\n(3) The growth of shells is very rapid when it does take place.\r\n\r\n(4) Most species bury themselves in the ground to increase the\r\ndimensions of their shells.\r\n\r\nSix recently hatched _H. pomatia_ were placed in a box and regularly\r\nfed on lettuce and cabbage leaves from August until December, when\r\nthey buried themselves in the soil for winter; at this period they had\r\ngradually increased in dimensions to the size of _H. hispida_. On the\r\n1st April following, the box was placed in the garden, and on the 3rd\r\nthe Helices reappeared on the surface, being _no larger_ in size than\r\nthey were in December. Although regularly fed up to 20th June, they\r\nwere not perceptibly larger, but on that day five of them disappeared,\r\nhaving buried themselves, with the mouth of the shell _downwards_, in\r\nthe soil. After ten days they reappeared, having in that short time\r\ngrown so rapidly as to be equal in size to _H. pisana_. On the 15th\r\nJuly they again buried themselves, and reappeared on 1st August, having\r\nagain increased in size. For three months from this date they did not\r\nbecome perceptibly larger; on 2nd November food was withheld for the\r\nwinter and they became dormant.\r\n\r\nA similar experiment, with similar results, was carried on with a\r\nnumber of _H. aspersa_, hatched on 20th June. During the summer they\r\ngrew but little, buried themselves on 10th October with the _head\r\nupwards_, and rose to the surface again on 5th April, not having\r\ngrown during the winter. In May they buried themselves with the _head\r\ndownwards_, and appeared again in a week double the size; this went on\r\nat about fortnightly intervals until 18th July, when they were almost\r\nfully grown.\r\n\r\n_Helix nemoralis_, _H. virgata_, _H. caperata_, and _H. hispida_ bury\r\nthemselves to grow; _H. rotundata_ burrows into decayed wood; _Hyalinia\r\nradiatula_ appears to remain on decaying blades of grass; _Pupa\r\numbilicata_, _Clausilia rugosa_, and _Buliminus obscurus_ bury their\r\nheads only.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Mr. W. E. Collinge[90] do not at all agree with\r\nthose of Mr. Lowe, with regard to the mode in which land Mollusca\r\nenlarge their shells. He bred and reared most of the commoner forms\r\nof _Helix_ and also _Clausilia rugosa_, but never saw them bury any\r\npart of their shell when enlarging it. While admitting that they may\r\nincrease their shells when in holes or burrows of earthworms, he\r\nthinks that the process of burying would seriously interfere with the\r\naction of the mantle during deposition, and in many cases damage the\r\nmembranaceous film before the calcareous portion was deposited. Mr.\r\nCollinge has found the following species under the surface in winter:\r\n_Arion ater_ (3–4 in.), _Agriolimax agrestis_, (6–8 in.), _Hyalinia\r\ncellaria_ and _H. alliaria_ (6–8 in.), _Hyalinia glabra_ (5 in.),\r\n_Helix aspersa_ (5–6 in.), _H. rufescens_ (4–6 in.), _H. rotundata_\r\n(4–5 in.), _H. hispida_ (7 in.), _Buliminus obscurus_ (4–6 in.),\r\n_B. montanus_[91] (24 in.), and the following in summer, _Hyalinia\r\ncellaria_ and _alliaria_ (6–8 in.), _Helix rotundata_ (4–5 in.), _Balea\r\nperversa_ (6–8 in.), _Cyclostoma elegans_ (3–4 in.). The same author\r\nhas found the following species of fresh-water Mollusca living in hard\r\ndry mud: _Sphaerium corneum_ (3–14 in.), _S. rivicola_ (5–6 in.), _S.\r\nlacustre_ (10–14 in.), all the British species of _Pisidium_ (4–12\r\nin.), _Limnaea truncatula_ (18 in., a single specimen). All our species\r\nof _Unio_, _Anodonta_, _Bithynia_, and _Paludina_ bury themselves\r\nhabitually in fine or thick wet mud, to a depth of from 4 to 14 inches.\r\n\r\nThis burying propensity on the part of Mollusca has been known to\r\nplay its part in detecting fraud. When my friend Mr. E. L. Layard was\r\nadministering justice in Ceylon, a native landowner on a small scale\r\ncomplained to him of the conduct of his neighbour, who had, during his\r\nabsence from home, diverted a small watercourse, which ran between\r\ntheir holdings, in such a way as to filch a certain portion of the\r\nland. The offender had filled up and obliterated the ancient course\r\nof the stream, and protested that it had never run but in its present\r\nbed. Mr. Layard promptly had a trench sunk across what was said to\r\nbe the old course, and the discovery of numerous _living Ampullaria_,\r\nburied in the mud, confirmed the story of one of the litigants and\r\nconfounded the other.[92]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Depositing and Hatching of Eggs: Self-fertilisation.=--There appears\r\nto be no doubt that Helices, when once impregnated, can lay successive\r\nbatches of eggs, and possibly can continue laying for several years,\r\nwithout a further act of union. A specimen of _Helix aspersa_ was\r\nnoticed in company with another on 5th August; on 9th August it laid\r\neggs in the soil, and early in the following summer it laid a second\r\nbatch of eggs, although its companion had been removed directly after\r\nits first introduction. An _Arion_ received from a distance laid 30\r\neggs on 5th September, and 70 more on the 23rd of the same month,\r\nalthough quite isolated during the whole time.[93] By far the most\r\nremarkable case of the kind is related by Gaskoin.[94] A specimen of\r\n_Helix lactea_ was kept in a drawer for about two years, and then in\r\nanother drawer for about two years more. It was then taken out, and\r\nplaced in water, when it revived, and was placed alone under a bell jar\r\nwith earth and food. Six months after, about 30 young _H. lactea_ were\r\nfound crawling on the glass, the act of oviposition not having been\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nThe observations of Mr. F. W. Wotton,[95] with regard to the\r\nfertilisation and egg-laying of _Arion ater_, are of extreme interest\r\nand value. A pair of this species, kept in captivity, united on 10th\r\nSeptember 1889, the act lasting about 25 minutes. From that date until\r\nthe eggs were laid, the animals looked sickly, dull of colour, with a\r\nsomewhat dry skin. Eggs were deposited in batches, one, which we will\r\ncall _A_, beginning three days before _B_. On 10th October _A_ laid 80\r\neggs; on the 16th, 110; on the 25th, 77; on 8th November, 82; and on\r\n17th November, 47; making a total of 396. Specimen _B_, which began on\r\n13th October, three days after _A_, made up for the delay by laying 246\r\neggs in 40 hours; on 26th October it laid 9, on 10th November, 121; and\r\non 30th November, 101; a total of 477. These eggs weighed 624 to the\r\nounce, and, in excluding the batch of 246, _B_ parted with ⅜ of its own\r\nweight in 40 hours, while the whole number laid were rather over ¾ of\r\nits own weight!\r\n\r\nWhile depositing the eggs, the slug remained throughout in the\r\nsame position on the surface of the ground, with the head drawn up\r\nunderneath the mantle, which was lifted just above the reproductive\r\norifice. When taken into the hand, it went on laying eggs without\r\ninterruption or agitation of any kind. After it had finished laying\r\nit ate half a raw potato and then took a bath, remaining submerged\r\nfor more than an hour. Bathing is a favourite pastime at all periods.\r\nSpecimens, says Mr. Wotton, have survived a compulsory bath, with total\r\nsubmersion, of nearly three days’ duration.\r\n\r\nMr. Wotton’s account of the hatching of the eggs is equally\r\ninteresting. It is noticeable that the eggs of one batch do not hatch\r\nby any means simultaneously; several days frequently intervene. The\r\naverage period is about 60 days, a damp and warm situation bringing out\r\nthe young in 40 days, while cold and dryness extended the time to 74\r\ndays, extremes of any kind proving fatal. Of the batch of eggs laid by\r\n_B_ on 30th November, the first 2 were hatched on the following 16th\r\nJanuary, and 2 more on the 17th; others, from 10 to 20, followed suit\r\non the succeeding 5 days, until 82 in all were hatched, the remaining\r\n19 being unproductive.[96]\r\n\r\nBy placing the egg on a looking-glass the act of exclusion can be\r\nperfectly observed. For several days the inmate can be seen in motion,\r\nuntil at last a small crack appears in the surface of the shell: this\r\ngradually enlarges, until the baby slug is able to crawl out, although\r\nit not unfrequently backs into the shell again, as if unwilling to risk\r\nitself in the world. When it once begins to crawl freely, it buries\r\nitself in the ground for 4 or 5 days without food, after which time it\r\nemerges, nearly double its original size. At exclusion, the average\r\nlength is 9 mm., increasing to 56 mm. after the end of 5 months. Full\r\ngrowth is attained about the middle of the second year, and nearly all\r\ndie at the end of this year or the beginning of the next. Death from\r\nexhaustion frequently occurs after parturition. Death from suffocation\r\nis sometimes the result of the formation of small blisters on the\r\nmargin of the respiratory aperture. The attacks of an internal parasite\r\ncause death in a singular way. The upper tentacles swell at the base in\r\nsuch a way as to prevent their extrusion; digestive troubles follow,\r\nwith rigidity and loss of moisture, and death ensues in 2 or 3 days.\r\n\r\nMr. Wotton isolated newly-hatched specimens, with the view of\r\nexperimenting on their power of self-fertilisation, if the opportunity\r\nof fertilising and being fertilised by others was denied them. One\r\nof these, after remaining in absolute solitude for 10½ months, began\r\nto lay, scantily at first (11th January, 2; 25th January, 2; 11th\r\nFebruary, 2), but more abundantly afterwards (3rd April, 60; 15th and\r\n16th, 70; 29th, 53, etc.), the eggs being hatched out in 42–48 days.\r\nThe precautions taken seem to have been absolutely satisfactory, and\r\nthe fact of the power of self-fertilisation appears established as far\r\nas _Arion ater_ is concerned.\r\n\r\nBraun took young individuals of _Limnaea auricularia_ on the day they\r\nwere hatched out, and placed them singly in separate vessels with\r\ndiffering amounts of water. This was on 15th June 1887. In August 1888\r\nspecimen _A_ had only produced a little spawn, out of which three\r\nyoung were hatched; specimen _B_ had produced four pieces of spawn\r\nof different sizes, all of which were hatched; specimen _C_, which\r\nhappened to be living with three _Planorbis_, produced five pieces\r\nof spawn distinctly Limnaeidan, but nothing is recorded of their\r\nhatching. Self-impregnation, therefore, with a fruitful result, appears\r\nestablished for this species of _Limnaea_.[97]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Reproduction of Lost Parts.=--When deprived of their tentacles, eyes,\r\nor portions of the foot, Mollusca do not seem to suffer severely, and\r\ngenerally reproduce the lost parts in a short time. If, however, one of\r\nthe ganglia is injured, they perish. Certain of the Mollusca possess\r\nthe curious property of being able to amputate certain parts at will.\r\nWhen _Prophysaon_, a species of Californian slug, is annoyed by being\r\nhandled, an indented line appears at a point about two-thirds of the\r\nlength from the head, the line deepens, and eventually the tail is\r\nshaken completely off. Sometimes the _Prophysaon_ only threatens this\r\nspontaneous dismemberment; this line appears (always exactly in the\r\nsame place), but it thinks better of it, and the indentation proceeds\r\nno further.[98] According to Gundlach,[99] _Helix imperator_ and _H.\r\ncrenilabris_, two large species from Cuba, possess the same property,\r\nwhich is said to be also characteristic of the sub-genus _Stenopus_\r\n(W. Indies). Amongst marine species, _Harpa ventricosa_ and _Solen\r\nsiliqua_ have been observed to act in a similar way, _Harpa_ apparently\r\ncutting off the end of the foot by pressure of the shell. Karl Semper,\r\nin commenting on the same property in species of _Helicarion_ from the\r\nPhilippines (which whisk their tail up and down with almost convulsive\r\nrapidity, until it drops off), considers[100] it greatly to the\r\nadvantage of the mollusc, since any predacious bird which attempted\r\nto seize it, but only secured a fragment of tail, would probably be\r\ndiscouraged from a second attack, especially as the _Helicarion_ would\r\nmeanwhile have had time to conceal itself among the foliage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Strength and Muscular Force.=--The muscular strength of snails is\r\nsurprisingly great. Sandford relates[101] an experiment on a _Helix\r\naspersa_, weighing ¼ oz. He found it could drag vertically a weight of\r\n2¼ oz., or nine times its own weight. Another snail, weighing ⅓ oz.,\r\nwas able to drag in a horizontal direction along a smooth table twelve\r\nreels of cotton, a pair of scissors, a screwdriver, a key, and a knife,\r\nweighing in all no less than 17 oz., or more than fifty times its own\r\nweight. This latter experiment was much the same as asking a man of 12\r\nstone to pull a load of over 3¾ tons.\r\n\r\nIf a snail be placed on a piece of glass and made to crawl, it will\r\nbe seen that a series of waves appear to pursue one another along\r\nthe under surface of the foot, travelling from back to front in the\r\ndirection in which the animal is moving. Simroth has shown that the\r\nsole of the foot is covered with a dense network of muscular fibres,\r\nthose which run longitudinally being chiefly instrumental in producing\r\nthe undulatory motion. By means of these muscles the sole is first\r\nelongated in front, and then shortened behind to an equal extent. Thus\r\na snail _slides_, not on the ground, but on its own mucus, which it\r\ndeposits mechanically, and which serves the purpose of lubricating the\r\nground on which it travels. It has been calculated that an averaged\r\nsized snail of moderate pace progresses at the rate of about a mile in\r\n16 days 14 hours.[102]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sudden Appearance of Mollusca.=--It is very remarkable to notice how\r\nsuddenly Pulmonata seem to appear in certain districts where they have\r\nnot been noticed before. This sudden appearance is more common in the\r\ncase of fresh-water than of land Mollusca, and there can be little\r\ndoubt that, wherever a new pond happens to be formed, unless there is\r\nsomething in its situation or nature which is absolutely hostile to\r\nmolluscan life, Mollusca are certain to be found in it sooner or later.\r\n“Some 23 years ago,” writes Mr. W. Nelson,[103] “I was in the habit\r\nof collecting shells in a small pond near to the Black Hills, Leeds.\r\nAt that time the only molluscan forms found there were a dwarf form\r\nof _Sphaerium lacustre_, _Pisidium pusillum_, _Planorbis nautileus_,\r\nand _Limnaea peregra_. About 10 years ago I resumed my visits to the\r\nlocality, and found, in addition to the species already enumerated,\r\n_Planorbis corneus_. These were the only species found there until this\r\nspring [1883], when, during one of my frequent visits, I was surprised\r\nto find _Physa fontinalis_ and _Planorbis vortex_ were added to the\r\ngrowing list of species. Later on _Pl. carinatus_, _Limnaea stagnalis_,\r\nand _Ancylus lacustris_ turned up; and during June, _Pl. contortus_\r\nwas found in this small but prolific pond.” _Limnaea glutinosa_ is\r\nprominent for these remarkable appearances and disappearances. In 1822\r\nthis species suddenly appeared in some small gravel pits at Bottisham,\r\nCambs., in such numbers that they might have been scooped out by\r\nhandfuls. After that year they did not appear numerous, and after three\r\nor four seasons they gradually disappeared.[104] _Physa_ (_Aplecta_)\r\n_hypnorum_ is noted in a similar way. In February 1852, for instance,\r\nafter a wet month, the water stood in small puddles about 3 feet by 2\r\nin a particular part of Bottisham Park which was sometimes a little\r\nswampy, though usually quite dry. One of these puddles was found to\r\ncontain immense numbers of the _Aplecta_, which up to that time had not\r\nbeen noted as occurring in Cambridgeshire at all.[105] In a few days\r\nthe species entirely disappeared and was never again noticed in the\r\nlocality.[106]\r\n\r\nWriting to the Zoological Society of London from New Caledonia, Mr. E.\r\nL. Layard remarks:[107] “The West Indian species _Stenogyra octona_\r\nhas suddenly turned up here in thousands; how introduced, none can\r\ntell. They are on a coffee estate at Kanala on the east coast. I have\r\nmade inquiries, and cannot find that the planter ever had seed coffee\r\nfrom the West Indies. All he planted came from Bombay, and it would be\r\ninteresting to find out whether the species has appeared there also.”\r\n\r\nSometimes a very small event is sufficient to disturb the natural\r\nequilibrium of a locality, and to become the cause either of the\r\nintroduction or of the destruction of a species. In 1883 a colony of\r\n_Helix sericea_ occupied a portion of a hedge bottom twenty yards long\r\nnear Newark. It scarcely occurred outside this limit, but within it was\r\nvery plentiful, living in company with _H. nemoralis_, _H. hortensis_,\r\n_H. hispida_, _H. rotundata_, _Hyalinia cellaria_ and _Hy. nitidula_,\r\nand _Cochlicopa lubrica_. In 1888 the hedge was well trimmed, but the\r\nbottom was not touched, and the next year a long and careful search was\r\nrequired to find even six specimens of the _sericea_.[108]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Showers of Shells.=--_Helix virgata_, _H. caperata_, and _Cochlicella\r\nacuta_ sometimes occur on downs near our sea-coasts in such\r\nextraordinary profusion, that their sudden appearance out of their\r\nhiding-places at the roots of the herbage after a shower of rain has\r\nled to the belief, amongst credulous people, that they have actually\r\ndescended with the rain. There seems, however, no reason to doubt that\r\nMollusca may be caught up by whirlwinds into the air and subsequently\r\ndeposited at some considerable distance from their original habitat,\r\nin the same way as frogs and fishes. A very recent instance of such a\r\nphenomenon occurred[109] at Paderborn, in Westphalia, where, on 9th\r\nAugust 1892, a yellowish cloud suddenly attracted attention from its\r\ncolour and the rapidity of its motion. In a few moments it burst,\r\nwith thunder and a torrential rain, and immediately afterwards the\r\npavements were found to be covered with numbers of _Anodonta anatina_,\r\nall of which had the shell broken by the violence of the fall. It was\r\nclearly established that the shells could not have been washed into\r\nthe streets from any adjacent river or pond, and their true origin\r\nwas probably indicated when it was found that the funnel-shaped cloud\r\nwhich burst over the town had passed across the one piece of water near\r\nPaderborn, which was known to contain the _Anodonta_ in abundance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cases of Singular Habitat.=--Mollusca sometimes accustom themselves\r\nto living in very strange localities, besides the extremes of heat and\r\ncold mentioned above (pp. 23–24). In the year 1852, when some large\r\nwaterpipes in the City Road, near St. Luke’s Hospital, were being taken\r\nup for repairs, they were found to be inhabited in considerable numbers\r\nby _Neritina fluviatilis_ and a species of _Limnaea_.[110] _Dreissensia\r\npolymorpha_ has been found in a similar situation in Oxford Street,\r\nand also in Hamburg, and has even been known to block the pipes and\r\ncisterns of private houses. In an engine cistern at Burnley, 60 feet\r\nabove the canal from which the water was pumped into the cistern,\r\nwere found the following species: _Sphaerium corneum_, _S. lacustre_;\r\n_Valvata piscinalis_, _Bithynia tentaculata_; _Limnaea peregra_, very\r\nlike _Succinea_ in form and texture; _Planorbis albus_, _P. corneus_,\r\n_P. nitidus_, _P. glaber_, and thousands of _P. dilatatus_, much larger\r\nthan the forms in the canal below, a fact probably due to the equable\r\ntemperature of the water in the cistern all the year round.[111] In\r\ncertain parts of southern Algeria the fresh-water genera _Melania_ and\r\n_Melanopsis_ inhabit abundantly waters so surcharged with salt that\r\nthe marine _Cardium edule_ has actually become extinct from excess\r\nof brine. The common _Mytilus edulis_ is sometimes found within the\r\nbranchial chamber and attached to the abdomen of crabs (_Carcinus\r\nmaenas_), which are obliged to carry about a burden of which they\r\nare powerless to rid themselves (see p. 78). A variety of the common\r\n_Limnaea peregra_ lives in the hot water of some of the geysers of\r\nIceland, and has accordingly been named _geisericola_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Underground Snails.=--Not only do many of the land Mollusca aestivate,\r\nor hibernate, as the case may be, beneath the surface of the soil, but\r\na certain number of species live permanently underground, like the\r\nmole, and scarcely ever appear in the light of day. Our own little\r\n_Caecilianella acicula_ lives habitually from 1 to 3 feet below\r\nground, appearing to prefer the vicinity of graveyards. _Testacella_,\r\nthe carnivorous slug, scarcely ever appears on the surface during\r\nthe day, except when driven by excessive rain, and even then it\r\nlurks awhile under some protecting cover of leafage. There is a\r\ncurious little _Helix_ (_tristis_ Pfr.), peculiar to Corsica, which\r\nis of distinctly subterranean habits. It lives in drifted sand above\r\nhigh-water mark, always at the roots of _Genista Saltzmanni_, at a\r\ndepth which varies with the temperature and dryness of the air. In hot\r\nand very dry weather it buries itself nearly 2 feet below the surface,\r\nonly coming up during rain, and burying itself again immediately the\r\nrain is over. Like a _Solen_, it often has a hole above its burrow, by\r\nwhich it communicates with the air above, so as to avoid being stifled\r\nin the sand. The animal, in spite of its dry habitat, is singularly\r\nsoft and succulent, and exudes a very glutinous mucus. It probably\r\ndescends in its burrow until it arrives at the humid stratum, the\r\npersistence of which is due to the capillarity of the sand.[112] I am\r\nassured by Mr. E. L. Layard that precisely similar underground habits\r\nare characteristic of _Coeliaxis Layardi_, which lives exclusively in\r\nsand at the roots of scrub and coarse grass at East London.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rock-boring Snails.=--Cases have sometimes been recorded, from which\r\nit would appear that certain species of snails possess the power of\r\nexcavating holes in rocks to serve as hiding-places. At Les Bois des\r\nRoches, ten miles from Boulogne, occur a number of solid calcareous\r\nrocks scattered about in the wood. The sides of the rocks which face\r\nN.E. and E. are covered with multitudes of funnel-shaped holes, 1½\r\ninch in diameter at the opening and contracting suddenly within to\r\n½ inch. Sometimes the holes are 6 inches deep, and terminate, after\r\nconsiderable windings, in a cup-shaped cavity. _Helix hortensis_\r\ninhabits these holes, and has been observed to excavate them at the\r\nrate of ½ inch each hibernation, choosing always the side of the rock\r\nwhich is sheltered from the prevailing rains. It does not form an\r\nepiphragm, but protrudes part of its body against the rock. That the\r\nsnails secrete an acid which acts as a solvent seems probable from the\r\nfact that red litmus paper, on being applied to the place where the\r\nfoot has been, becomes stained with violet.[113] _Helix aspersa_ is\r\nsaid to excavate holes 10 to 12 cm. deep at Constantine,[114] and _H.\r\nMazzullii_ is recorded as perforating limestone at Palermo.[115]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Snails as Barometers.=--An American writer of more than thirty years\r\nago[116] gave his experience of Helices as weather-prophets. According\r\nto him, _H. alternata_ is never seen abroad except shortly before rain;\r\nit then climbs on the bark of trees, and stations itself on leaves.\r\n_Helix clausa_, _H. ligera_, _H. pennsylvanica_, and _H. elevata_ climb\r\ntrees two days before rain, if it is to be abundant and continuous.\r\n_Succinea_ does the same, and its body is yellow before rain and bluish\r\nafter it. Several of the Helices assume a sombre colour after rain,\r\nwhen their bodies are exceedingly humid; after the humidity has passed\r\noff they resume a clearer and lighter tint.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Production of Musical and other Sounds.=--Certain molluscs are said\r\nto be capable of producing musical sounds. Sir J. E. Tennent describes\r\nhis visit to a brackish-water lake at Batticaloa, in Ceylon, where the\r\nfishermen give the name of the ‘crying shell’ to the animal supposed to\r\nproduce the sounds. “The sounds,” he says,[117] “came up from the water\r\nlike the gentle thrills of a musical chord, or the faint vibrations\r\nof a wineglass when its rim is rubbed by a moistened finger. It was\r\nnot one sustained note, but a multitude of tiny sounds, each clear\r\nand distinct in itself; the sweetest treble mingling with the lowest\r\nbass. On applying the ear to the woodwork of the boat, the vibration\r\nwas greatly increased in volume. The sounds varied considerably at\r\ndifferent points as we moved across the lake, and occasionally we rowed\r\nout of hearing of them altogether.” According to the fishermen, the\r\nshells were _Pyrazus palustris_ and _Littorina laevis_. It appears\r\nuncertain whether the sounds are really due to Mollusca. Fishermen in\r\nother parts of India assert that the sounds are made by fish, and, like\r\nthose in Ceylon, produce the fish which they say ‘sings.’ The same,\r\nor a similar sound, has also been noticed to issue from the water in\r\ncertain parts of Chili, and on the northern shores of the Gulf of\r\nMexico. _Dendronotus arborescens_, when confined in a glass jar of sea\r\nwater, has been noticed[118] to emit a sound like the clink of a steel\r\nwire. According to Lieut.-Col. Portlock,[119] F.R.S., _Helix aperta_,\r\na very common species in South Europe, has the property of emitting\r\nsounds when irritated. When at Corfu, he noticed that if the animal is\r\nirritated by a touch with a piece of straw or other light material, it\r\nemits a noise, as if grumbling at being disturbed. He kept a specimen\r\nin his house for a considerable time, which would make this noise\r\nwhenever it was touched.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. H. G. Barnacle describes the musical properties of\r\n_Achatinella_ in the following terms:[120] “When up the mountains\r\nof Oahu I heard the grandest but wildest music, as from hundreds of\r\nAeolian harps, wafted to me on the breezes, and my companion (a native)\r\ntold me it came from, as he called them, the singing shells. It was\r\nsublime. I could not believe it, but a tree close at hand proved it.\r\nOn it were many of the _Achatinella_, the animals drawing after them\r\ntheir shells, which grated against the wood and so caused a sound; the\r\nmultitude of sounds produced the fanciful music. On this one tree I\r\ntook 70 shells of all varieties.”\r\n\r\n\r\n=Habits of the Agnatha.=--Not much is known of the habits and mode of\r\nlife of the _Agnatha_, or carnivorous Land Mollusca. In this country\r\nwe have only two, or at most three, of this group, belonging to the\r\ngenus _Testacella_, and, in all probability, not indigenous to our\r\nshores. There seems little doubt, when all the circumstances of their\r\ndiscovery are taken into account, that both _Testacella haliotidea_\r\nand _T. Maugei_ have been imported, perhaps from Spain or Portugal in\r\nthe first instance, along with roots imbedded in foreign earth, for\r\ntheir earliest appearances can almost invariably be traced back to the\r\nneighbourhood of large nursery grounds, or else to gardens supplied\r\ndirectly from such establishments.\r\n\r\nThe underground life of _Testacella_ makes observation of its habits\r\ndifficult. It is believed to feed exclusively on earthworms, which\r\nit pursues in their burrows. Continued wet weather drives it to the\r\nsurface, for though loving damp soil it is decidedly averse to\r\ntoo much moisture, and under such circumstances it has even been\r\nnoticed[121] in considerable numbers crawling over a low wall. In the\r\nspring and autumn months, according to Lacaze-Duthiers,[122] it comes\r\nto the surface at night, hiding itself under stones and _débris_ during\r\nthe day. Earthworms are, at these periods, nearer the surface, and the\r\n_Testacella_ has been seen creeping down into their burrows. The author\r\nhas taken _T. Maugei_ abundantly under clumps of the common white pink\r\nin very wet weather, lying in a sort of open nest in the moist earth.\r\nOn the other hand, when the earth is baked dry by continued drought,\r\nthey either bury themselves deeper, sometimes at a depth of 3 feet, in\r\nthe ground, or else become encysted in a capsule of hardened mucus to\r\nprevent evaporation from the skin. When first taken from the earth and\r\nplaced in a box, the _Testacella_ invariably resents its capture by\r\nspitting up the contents of its stomach in the shape of long fragments\r\nof half-digested worms.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--_Testacella haliotidea_ Drap.,\r\n  protruding its pharynx (_ph_) and radula (_r_); _oe_, oesophagus;\r\n  _p.o_, pulmonary orifice; _sh_, shell; _t_, tentacles (after\r\n  Lacaze-Duthiers).]\r\n\r\nIt appears not to bite the worm up before swallowing it, but contrives,\r\nin the most remarkable manner, to take down whole worms apparently\r\nmuch too large for its stomach. Mr. Butterell relates[123] that, after\r\nteasing a specimen of _T. Maugei_, and making it emit a quantity of\r\nfrothy mucus from the respiratory aperture, he procured a worm of about\r\nthree inches long, and rubbed the worm gently across the head of the\r\n_Testacella_. The tongue was rapidly extended, and the victim seized.\r\nThe odontophore was then withdrawn, carrying with it the struggling\r\nworm, which made every effort to escape, but in vain; in about five\r\nminutes all had disappeared except the head, which was rejected. This\r\nprotrusion of the tongue (_radula_) and indeed of the whole pharynx,\r\nis a very remarkable feature in the habits of the animal. It appears,\r\nas it were, to harpoon its prey by a rapid thrust, and when the victim\r\nis once pierced by a few of the powerful sickle-shaped teeth (compare\r\nchap. viii.) it is slowly but surely drawn into the oesophagus (Fig.\r\n20).\r\n\r\nMost gardeners are entirely ignorant of the character of _Testacella_,\r\nand confuse it, if they happen to notice it at all, with the common\r\nenemies of their tender nurslings. Cases have been known, however,\r\nwhen an intelligent gardener has kept specimens on purpose to kill\r\nworms in ferneries or conservatories. In some districts these slugs\r\nare very numerous; Lacaze-Duthiers once dug 182 specimens from a good\r\nwell-manured piece of ground whose surface measured only ten square\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of September or beginning of October the period of\r\nhibernation begins. I infer this from the behaviour of specimens kept\r\nin captivity, which, for about a fortnight before this time, gorged\r\nthemselves inordinately on as many worms as I chose to put into their\r\nbox, and then suddenly refused food, buried themselves deeply in the\r\nearth, and appeared no more during the winter. The eggs are apparently\r\nmuch less numerous than is the case with _Limax_ or _Helix_, and very\r\nlarge, measuring about ⅙ inch in diameter. They are enveloped in a\r\nremarkably tough and elastic membrane, and, if dropped upon any hard\r\nsurface, rebound several inches, just like an india-rubber ball.\r\n\r\nThe animal creeps rather rapidly, and has the power of elongating\r\nits body to a remarkable extent. When placed on the surface of the\r\nground, in the full light of day, it soon betrays uneasiness, and\r\nendeavours to creep into concealment. Its method of burying itself is\r\nvery interesting to watch. It first elongates its neck and inserts its\r\nhead into the soil; gradually the body begins to follow, while the tail\r\ntilts upwards into the air. No surface motion of the skin, no writhing\r\nor wriggling motion of any kind occurs; the creature simply works its\r\nway down in a stealthy and mysterious way, until at last it is lost to\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThe great _Glandina_, which attain their maximum development in Mexico\r\nand the southern United States, are a very noticeable family in this\r\ngroup. According to Mr. Binney,[124] _Glandina truncata_ Gmel., one\r\nof the commonest species of the genus, is somewhat aquatic in its\r\nhabits. It is found in the sea islands of Georgia and around the keys\r\nand everglades of Florida, where it attains a maximum length of 4\r\ninches, while in less humid situations it scarcely measures more than\r\n1 inch. It occurs most abundantly in the centre of clumps and tussocks\r\nof coarse grass in marshes close to the sea-coast. By the action of\r\nthe sharp, sickle-shaped teeth of its radula the soft parts of its\r\nprey (which consists chiefly of living Helices) are rapidly rasped\r\naway; sometimes they are swallowed whole. It has been known to attack\r\n_Limax_ when confined in the same box, rasping off large pieces of the\r\nintegument. In one case an individual was noticed to devour one of its\r\nown species, thrusting its long neck into the interior of the shell,\r\nand removing all the viscera.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 21.--_Glandina sowerbyana_ Pfr. (Strebel).]\r\n\r\nThe _Glandinae_ of southern Europe, although scarcely rivalling those\r\nof Central America in size or beauty, possess similar carnivorous\r\npropensities. _Glandina Poireti_ has been observed,[125] on Veglia\r\nIsland, attacking a living _Cyclostoma elegans_. By its powerful teeth\r\nit filed through two or three whorls of the shell of its victim, and\r\nthen proceeded to devour it, exactly in the same manner as a _Natica_\r\nor _Buccinum_ perforates the shell of a _Tellina_ or _Mactra_ in order\r\nto get at its contents.\r\n\r\nFew observations appear to have been made on the habits or food of\r\n_Streptaxis_, _Rhytida_, _Ennea_, _Daudebardia_, _Paryphanta_, and\r\nother carnivorous Mollusca. A specimen of _Ennea sulcata_, enclosed in\r\nthe same box as a Madagascar _Helix_ (_sepulchralis_ Fér.) many times\r\nits own size, completely emptied the shell of its inhabitant.[126]\r\nMr. E. L. Layard informs me that certain Cape _Rhytida_, _e.g._ _R.\r\ncapsula_ Bens., _R. dumeticola_ Bens., and _R. vernicosa_ Kr., eat\r\n_Cyclostoma affine_, _Helix capensis_, _H. cotyledonis_, etc. To Mr.\r\nLayard I am also indebted for the--perhaps apocryphal--tradition that\r\nthe best time to capture the great _Aerope caffra_ Fér. in numbers\r\nwas after an engagement between the Kaffirs and Zulus, when they might\r\nbe observed streaming from all points of the compass towards the field\r\nof slaughter. The Cuban _Oleacina_ are known to secrete a very bitter\r\nfluid which they emit; this perhaps produces a poisoning or benumbing\r\neffect upon their victims when seized. They devour operculates, _e.g._\r\n_Helicina regina_ and _sagraiana_.[127]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n          ENEMIES OF THE MOLLUSCA--MEANS OF DEFENCE--MIMICRY\r\n                 AND PROTECTIVE COLORATION--PARASITIC\r\n                   MOLLUSCA--COMMENSALISM--VARIATION\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =Enemies of the Mollusca=\r\n\r\nThe juicy flesh and defenceless condition of many of the Mollusca make\r\nthem the favourite food and often the easy prey of a host of enemies\r\nbesides man. Gulls are especially partial to bivalves, and may be\r\nnoticed, in our large sandy bays at the recess of the tide, busily\r\ndevouring _Tellina_, _Mactra_, _Mya_, _Syndosmya_, and _Solen_. On the\r\nIrish coast near Drogheda a herring gull has been observed[128] to take\r\na large mussel, fly up with it in the air over some shingly ground and\r\nlet it fall. On alighting and finding that the shell was unbroken it\r\nagain took it up and repeated the process a number of times, flying\r\nhigher and higher with it until the shell was broken. Hooded crows,\r\nafter many unavailing attempts to break open mussels with their beak,\r\nhave been seen to behave in a similar way.[129] Crows, vultures, and\r\naquatic birds carry thousands of mussels, etc., up to the top of the\r\nmountains above Cape Town, where their empty shells lie in enormous\r\nheaps about the cliffs.[130]\r\n\r\nThe common limpet is the favourite food of the oyster-catcher, whose\r\nstrong bill, with its flattened end, is admirably calculated to\r\ndislodge the limpet from its seat on the rock. When the limpet is\r\nyoung, the bird swallows shell and all, and it has been calculated\r\nthat a single flock of oyster-catchers, frequenting a small Scotch\r\nloch, must consume hundreds of thousands of limpets in the course\r\nof a single year. Rats are exceedingly fond of limpets, whose shells\r\nare frequently found in heaps at the mouth of rat holes, especially\r\nwhere a cliff shelves gradually towards a rocky shore. A rat jerks the\r\nlimpet off with a sudden movement of his powerful jaw, and, judging\r\nfrom the size of the empty shells about the holes, has no difficulty in\r\ndislodging the largest specimens. ‘I once landed,’ relates a shepherd\r\nto Mr. W. Anderson Smith,[131] ‘on the I. of Dunstaffnage to cut grass,\r\nand it was so full of rats that I was afraid to go on; and the grass\r\nwas so full of limpets that I could scarcely use the scythe, and had\r\nto keep sharpening it all the time.’ Sometimes, however, the limpet\r\ngets the better both of bird and beast. The same writer mentions the\r\ncase of a rat being caught by the lip by a limpet shell, which it was\r\ntrying to dislodge. A workman once observed[132] a bird on Plymouth\r\nbreakwater fluttering in rather an extraordinary manner, and, on going\r\nto the spot, found that a ring dotterel had somehow got its toe under a\r\nlimpet, which, in closing instantly to the rock, held it fast. Similar\r\ncases of the capture of ducks by powerful bivalves are not uncommon,\r\nand it is said that on some parts of the American coasts, where clams\r\nabound, it is impossible to keep ducks at all,[133] for they are sure\r\nto be caught by the molluscs and drowned by the rising tide.\r\n\r\nThe _Weekly Bulletin_ of San Francisco, 17th May 1893, contains an\r\naccount of the trapping of a coyote, or prairie wolf, at Punta Banda,\r\nSan Diego Co., by a _Haliotis Cracherodii_. The coyote had evidently\r\nbeen hunting for a fish breakfast, and finding the _Haliotis_ partially\r\nclinging to the rock, had inserted his muzzle underneath to detach it,\r\nwhen the _Haliotis_ instantly closed down upon him and kept him fast\r\nprisoner.\r\n\r\nRats devour the ponderous Uniones of North America. When _Unio_ moves,\r\nthe foot projects half an inch or more beyond the valves. If, when in\r\nthis condition, the valves are tightly pinched, the foot is caught, and\r\nif the pinching is continued the animal becomes paralysed and unable to\r\nmake use of the adductor muscles, and consequently flies open even if\r\nthe pressure is relaxed. The musk-rat (_Fiber zibethicus_) seizes the\r\n_Unio_ in his jaws, and by the time he reaches his hole, the _Unio_ is\r\nready to gape.[134] Rats also eat _Vivipara_, and even _Limnaea_, in\r\nevery part of the world.\r\n\r\nEvery kind of slug and snail is eaten greedily by blackbirds, thrushes,\r\nchaffinches, and in fact by many species of birds. A thrush will very\r\noften have a special sacrificial stone, on which he dashes the shells\r\nof _Helix aspersa_ and _nemoralis_, holding them by the lip with his\r\nbeak, until the upper whorls are broken; heaps of empty shells will be\r\nfound lying about the place of slaughter. The bearded Titmouse (_Parus\r\nbiarmicus_) consumes quantities of _Succinea putris_ and small _Pupa_,\r\nwhich are swallowed whole and become triturated in the bird’s stomach\r\nby the aid of numerous angular fragments of quartz.[135]\r\n\r\nFrogs and toads are very partial to land Mollusca. A garden attached to\r\nthe Laboratory of Agricultural Chemistry at Rouen had been abandoned\r\nfor three years to weeds and slugs. The director introduced 100 toads\r\nand 90 frogs, and in less than a month all the slugs were destroyed,\r\nand all kinds of vegetables and flowers, whose cultivation had until\r\nthen been impossible, were enabled to flourish.[136]\r\n\r\nCertain Coleoptera are known to prey upon Helices and other land\r\nMollusca. Récluz noticed, near Agde, a beetle (_Staphylinus olens_)\r\nattack _Helix ericetorum_ when crawling among herbage, sticking its\r\nsharp mandibles into its head. Every time the snail retreated into\r\nits shell the beetle waited patiently for its reappearance, until at\r\nlast the snail succumbed to the repeated assaults. M. Lucas noticed,\r\nat Oran, the larva of a _Drilus_ attacking a _Cyclostoma_. The\r\n_Drilus_ stood sentinel at the mouth of a shell, which was closed by\r\nthe operculum, until the animal began to issue forth. The _Drilus_\r\nthen with its mandibles cut the muscle which attaches the operculum\r\nto the foot, disabling it sufficiently to prevent its being securely\r\nclosed, upon which it entered and took possession of the body of its\r\ndefenceless host, completing its metamorphosis inside the shell, after\r\na period of six weeks.[137] The female glow-worm (_Lampyris noctiluca_)\r\nattacks and kills _Helix nemoralis_.\r\n\r\nAmong the Clavicornia, some species of _Silpha_ carry on a determined\r\nwarfare against small Helices. They seize the shell in their\r\nmandibles, and then, throwing their head backwards, break the shell by\r\nstriking it against their prothorax.\r\n\r\nThe common water beetle, _Dytiscus marginalis_, from its strength and\r\nsavage disposition, is a dangerous enemy to fresh-water Mollusca. One\r\n_Dytiscus_, kept in an aquarium, has been noticed to kill and devour\r\nseven _Limnaea stagnalis_ in the course of one afternoon. The beetles\r\nalso eat _L. peregra_, but apparently prefer _stagnalis_, for when\r\nequal quantities of both species were placed within their reach, they\r\nfixed on the latter species first.[138]\r\n\r\nIn East Africa a species of Ichneumon (_Herpestes fasciatus_) devours\r\nsnails, lifting them up in its forepaws and dashing them down upon some\r\nhard substance.[139] In certain islands off the south coasts of Burmah,\r\nflat rocks covered with oysters are laid bare at low tide. A species\r\nof Monkey (_Macacus cynomolgus_) has been noticed to furnish himself\r\nwith a stone, and knock the oysters open, always breaking the hinge-end\r\nfirst, and then pulling out the mollusc with his fingers.[140]\r\n\r\nThe walrus is said to support himself almost entirely on two species\r\nof _Mya_ (_truncata_ and _arenaria_), digging them out of the sand, in\r\nwhich they live buried at a depth of about 1½ feet, with his powerful\r\ntusks. Whales swallow enormous numbers of pelagic molluscs (_Clio_,\r\n_Limacina_), which are at times so abundant in the Arctic seas, as to\r\ncolour the surface for miles. Many of the larger Cetacea subsist in\r\ngreat part on Cephalopoda; as many as 18 lbs. of beaks of Teuthidae\r\nhave been taken from the stomach of a single _Hyperoodon_.\r\n\r\nFish are remarkably partial to Mollusca of various kinds. The\r\ncat-fish (_Chimaera_) devours _Pectunculus_ and _Cyprina_, crushing\r\nthe stout shells with its powerful jaws, while flounders and soles\r\ncontent themselves with the smaller _Tellina_ and _Syndosmya_ which\r\nthey swallow whole. As many as from 30 to 40 specimens of _Buccinum\r\nundatum_ have been taken from the stomach of a single cod, and the same\r\n‘habitat’ has been recorded for some of the rarer whelks, _e.g._ _Bucc.\r\nhumphreysianum_, _Fusus fenestratus_, the latter also occurring as the\r\nfood of the haddock and the red gurnard. No less than 35,000 _Turtonia\r\nminuta_ have been found in the stomach of a single mullet. Nudibranchs\r\nare no doubt dainty morsels for fish, and hence have developed, in many\r\ncases, special faculties for concealment, or, if distasteful, special\r\nmeans of remaining conspicuous (see pp. 71–74).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Two valves of _Mytilus edulis_ L.,\r\n  representing diagrammatically the approximate position of the\r\n  holes bored by _Purpura_ in about 100 specimens of _Mytilus_,\r\n  gathered at Newquay, Cornwall.]\r\n\r\nBesides the dangers to which they are exposed from other enemies, many\r\nof the weaker forms of Mollusca fall a prey to their own brethren.\r\n_Nassa_ and _Murex_ on this side of the Atlantic, and _Urosalpinx_ on\r\nthe other, are the determined foes of the oyster. _Purpura lapillus_\r\nprefers _Mytilus edulis_ to any other food, piercing the shell in about\r\ntwo days’ time by its powerful radula, which it appears to employ\r\nsomewhat in gimlet fashion. If _Mytilus_ cannot be procured, it will\r\neat _Littorina_ or _Trochus_, but its attempts on the hard shell of\r\n_Patella_ are generally failures. The statement which is sometimes\r\nmade, that the _Purpura_ makes its hole over the vital parts of the\r\n_Mytilus_, appears, according to the evidence embodied in the annexed\r\nfigure, to be without foundation. The fact is that a hole in any part\r\nof its shell is fatal to the _Mytilus_, since the long proboscis of\r\nthe _Purpura_, having once made an entrance, can reach from one end of\r\nthe shell to the other. The branchiae are first attacked, the adductor\r\nmuscles and edges of the mantle last. _Natica_ and _Nassa_ pierce in a\r\nsimilar way the shells of _Mactra_, _Tellina_, _Donax_, and _Venus_.\r\n_Murex fortispina_ is furnished with a powerful tooth at the lower part\r\nof its outer lip. At Nouméa, in New Caledonia, its favourite food is\r\n_Arca pilosa_, which lives half buried in coral refuse. The _Murex_ has\r\nbeen seen to drag the _Arca_ from its place of concealment, and insert\r\nthe tooth between the valves, so as to prevent their closing, upon\r\nwhich it was enabled to devour its prey at leisure.[141]\r\n\r\nThe carnivorous land Mollusca, with the exception of _Testacella_,\r\nappear to feed by preference upon other snails (pp. 54, 55).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Parasitic Worms, Mites, etc.=--A considerable number of the\r\nTrematode worms pass one or more of the stages in the cycle of their\r\ndevelopment within the bodies of Mollusca, attaining to the more\r\nperfect or sexual form on reaching the interior of some vertebrate.\r\nThus _Distoma endolabum_ Duj. finds its first intermediate host in\r\n_Limnaea stagnalis_ and _L. ovata_, its second in _L. stagnalis_, or\r\nin one of the fresh-water shrimps (_Gammarus pulex_), or in the larvae\r\nof one of the _Phryganeidae_ (_Limnophilus rhombicus_), attaining to\r\nthe sexual form in the common frog. _Distoma ascidia_ v. Ben. passes\r\nfirstly through _Limnaea stagnalis_ or _Planorbis corneus_, secondly\r\nthrough certain flies and gnats (_Ephemera_, _Perla_, _Chironomus_),\r\nand finally arrives within certain species of bats. _Distoma nodulosum_\r\nZed. inhabits firstly _Paludina impura_, secondly certain fishes\r\n(_Cyprinus Acerina_), and lastly the common perch. The sporocyst of\r\n_Distoma macrostomum_ inhabits _Succinea putris_, pushing itself up\r\ninto the tentacles, which become unnaturally distended (Fig. 23). While\r\nin this situation it is swallowed by various birds, such as the thrush,\r\nwagtail, and blackbird, which are partial to _Succinea_, and thus\r\nobtains lodgment in their bodies. _Amphistoma subclavatum_ spends an\r\nearly stage in _Planorbis contortus_, after which it becomes encysted\r\non the skin of a frog. When the frog sheds its skin, it swallows it,\r\nand with it the _Amphistoma_, which thus becomes established in the\r\nfrog’s stomach.[142]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 23.--A Trematode worm (_Leucochloridium\r\n  paradoxum_ Car.) parasitic in the tentacles of _Succinea putris_\r\n  L. × 20 (after Baudon).]\r\n\r\nThe common liver-fluke, which in the winter of 1879–1880 cost Great\r\nBritain the lives of no less than three million sheep, is perhaps the\r\nbest known of these remarkable parasitic forms of life. Its history\r\nshows us, in one important particular, how essential it is for the\r\ncreature to meet, at certain stages of its existence, with the exact\r\nhost to which it is accustomed. Unless the newly-hatched embryo finds\r\na _Limnaea truncatula_ within about eight hours it becomes exhausted,\r\nsinks, and dies. It has been tried with all the other common pond and\r\nriver Mollusca, with _Limnaea peregra_, _palustris_, _auricularia_,\r\n_stagnalis_, with _Planorbis marginatus_, _carinatus_, _vortex_, and\r\n_spirorbis_, with _Physa fontinalis_, _Bithynia tentaculata_, _Paludina\r\nvivipara_, as well as with _Succinea putris_, _Limax agrestis_ and\r\n_maximus_, _Arion ater_ and _hortensis_. Not one of them would it\r\ntouch, except occasionally very young specimens of _L. peregra_, and in\r\nthese its development was arrested at an early stage. But on touching\r\na _L. truncatula_ the embryo seems to know at once that it has got\r\nwhat it wants, and sets to work immediately to bore its way into the\r\ntissues of its involuntary host, making by preference for the branchial\r\nchamber; those which enter the foot or other outlying parts of the\r\n_Limnaea_ proceed no farther.[143]\r\n\r\nMany similar cases occur, in which littoral Mollusca, such as\r\n_Littorina_ and _Buccinum_, form the intermediate host to a worm which\r\neventually arrives within some sea-bird.\r\n\r\nCertain Nematode worms (_Rhabditis_) are known to inhabit the intestine\r\nof _Arion_, and the salivary glands of _Limax agrestis_. Diptera\r\nhabitually lay their eggs within the eggs of _Helix_ and _Limax_.\r\nMany species of mite (_Acarina_) infest land Pulmonata. No adult\r\n_Limax maximus_ is without at least one specimen of _Philodromus_ (?)\r\n_limacum_, and the same, or an allied species, appears to occur on the\r\nlarger of our _Helices_, retiring upon occasion into the pulmonary\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the Crustacea live associated with certain molluscs.\r\n_Pinnotheres_ lives within the shell of _Pinna_, _Ostrea_, _Astarte_,\r\n_Pectunculus_, and others. Apparently the females alone reside within\r\nthe shell of their host, while the males seize favourable opportunities\r\nto visit them there. A specimen of the great pearl-oyster (_Meleagrina\r\nmargaritifera_) was recently observed which contained a male\r\nPinnotheres encysted in nacre. It was suggested that he had intruded at\r\nan unfortunate time, when no female of his kind happened to be in, and\r\nthat, having penetrated too far beneath the mantle in the ardour of his\r\nsearch, was made prisoner before he could escape.[144] _Ostracotheres\r\nTridacnae_ lives in the branchiae of the great _Tridacna_. A little\r\nbrachyurous crustacean inhabits the raft of _Ianthina_, and assumes the\r\nbrilliant blue colour of the mollusc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Means of Defence=\r\n\r\nAs a rule, among the Mollusca, the shell forms a passive mode of\r\nresistance to the attacks of enemies. Bivalves are enabled, by closing\r\ntheir valves, to baffle the assault of their smaller foes, and the\r\noperculum of univalves, both marine and land, serves a similar purpose.\r\nMany land Mollusca, especially _Helix_ and _Pupa_, as well as a number\r\nof _Auriculidae_, have the inside of the aperture beset with teeth,\r\nwhich are sometimes so numerous and so large that it is puzzling to\r\nunderstand how the animal can ever come out of its shell, or, having\r\ncome out, can ever draw itself back again. Several striking cases of\r\nthese toothed apertures are given in Fig. 24. Whatever may be the\r\norigin of these teeth, there can be little doubt that their extreme\r\ndevelopment must have a protective result in opposing a barrier to\r\nthe entrance, predatory or simply inquisitive, of beetles and other\r\ninsects. Sometimes, it will be noticed (_G_), the aperture itself is\r\nfairly simple, but a formidable array of obstacles is encountered a\r\nlittle way in. It is possible that the froth emitted by many land\r\nsnails has a similar effect in involving an irritating intruder in\r\na mass of sticky slime. The mucus of slugs and snails, on the other\r\nhand, is more probably, besides its use in facilitating locomotion, a\r\ncontrivance for checking evaporation, by surrounding the exposed parts\r\nof their bodies with a viscid medium.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Illustrating the elaborate\r\n  arrangement of teeth in the aperture of some land Pulmonata.\r\n  =A.= _Helix_ (_Labyrinthus_) _bifurcata_ Desh., Equador.\r\n  =B.= H.

The singular genus\r\n_Xenophora_ protects itself from observation by gluing stones, shells,\r\nand various _débris_ to the upper side of its whorls (Fig. 25).\r\nSometimes the selection is made with remarkable care; the _Challenger_,\r\nfor instance, obtained a specimen which had decorated its body whorl\r\nexclusively with long and pointed shells (Fig. 26).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 25.--_Xenophora_ (_Phorus_) _conchyliophora_\r\n  Born., concealed by the stones which it glues to the upper\r\n  surface of its shell. (From a British Museum specimen.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 26.--_Xenophora_ (_Phorus_) _pallidula_\r\n  Reeve. A mollusc which escapes detection by covering itself with\r\n  dead shells of other species. (From a _Challenger_ specimen in\r\n  the British Museum, × ½.)]\r\n\r\nThe formidable spines with which the shells, _e.g._ of the _Murex_\r\nfamily, are furnished must contribute greatly to their protection\r\nagainst fishes, and other predatory animals. _Murex tenuispina_, for\r\ninstance (see chap. ix.), would prove as dangerous a morsel in the\r\nmouth of a fish as a hedgehog in that of a dog. Whether the singular\r\ntooth in the outer lip of _Leucozonia_ (see chap. xiv.), a feature\r\nwhich is repeated, to a less marked extent, in _Monoceros_ and several\r\nof the West Coast muricoids, is developed for defensive purposes,\r\ncannot at present be decided.\r\n\r\nThe _Strombidae_ possess the power of executing long leaps, which they\r\ndoubtless employ to escape from their foes. In their case alone this\r\npower is combined with singular quickness of vision. On one occasion\r\nMr. Cuming, the celebrated collector, lost a beautiful specimen of\r\n_Terebellum_, by the animal suddenly leaping into the water, as he was\r\nholding and admiring it in his hand. Miss Saul has informed me that the\r\nfirst living specimen of _Trigonia_ that was ever obtained was lost\r\nin a similar way. It was dredged by Mr. Stutchbury in Sydney Harbour,\r\nand placed on the thwart of a small boat. He had just remarked to a\r\ncompanion that it must be a _Trigonia_, and his companion had laughed\r\nat the idea, reminding him that all known _Trigonia_ were fossil, when\r\nthe shell in question baffled their efforts to discover its generic\r\nposition by suddenly leaping into the sea, and it was three months\r\nbefore Mr. Stutchbury succeeded in obtaining another.\r\n\r\nSome genera possess more than merely passive means of defence. Many\r\nCephalopoda emit a cloud of inky fluid, which is of a somewhat viscous\r\nnature, and perhaps, besides being a means of covering retreat, serves\r\nto entangle or impede the pursuer. The formidable suckers and hooks\r\npossessed by many genera in this Order are most dangerous weapons,\r\nboth for offence and defence. _Aplysia_, when irritated, ejects a\r\npurple fluid which used to be considered dangerously venomous. Many of\r\nthe Aeolididae, including our own common _Aeolis papillosa_, possess\r\nstinging cells at the end of their dorsal papillae, the effect of which\r\nis probably to render them exceedingly distasteful to fish.\r\n\r\nThe common _Vitrina pellucida_ has a curious habit which in all\r\nprobability serves for a defence against birds in the winter. When\r\ncrawling on the edge of a stone or twig it has the power of suddenly\r\njerking its ‘tail,’ so as to throw itself on the ground, where it is\r\nprobably lost to sight among decaying leaves. At other times it rolls\r\naway a few inches and repeats the jump. It also possesses the power of\r\nattaching to itself bits of leaves or soil, which entirely cover and\r\nconceal both shell and animal.[145] The property of parting with the\r\ntail altogether, a remarkable form of self-defence, has already been\r\nnoticed on p. 44.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous nature of the bite of certain species of _Conus_ is well\r\nauthenticated. Surgeon Hinde, R.N., saw[146] a native on the I. of\r\nMatupi, New Britain, who had been bitten by a _Conus geographus_, and\r\nwho had at once cut small incisions with a sharp stone all over his\r\narm and shoulder. The blood flowed freely, and the native explained\r\nthat had he not taken these precautions he would have died. Instances\r\nhave been recorded of poisonous wounds being inflicted by the bite\r\nof _Conus aulicus_, _C. textile_, and _C. tulipa_. According to Mr.\r\nJ. Macgillivray[147] _C. textile_ at Aneitum (S. Pacific) is called\r\n_intrag_, and the natives say it spits the poison upon them from\r\nseveral inches off! Two cases of bites from _C. textile_ occurred to\r\nthis gentleman’s notice, one of which terminated fatally by gangrene.\r\nSir Edward Belcher, when in command of the _Samarang_, was bitten[148]\r\nby a _Conus aulicus_ at a little island off Ternate in the Moluccas.\r\nAs he took the creature out of the water, it suddenly exserted its\r\nproboscis and inflicted a wound, causing a sensation similar to that\r\nproduced by the burning of phosphorus under the skin. The wound was\r\na small, deep, triangular mark, succeeded by a watery vesicle. The\r\nnatives of New Guinea have a wholesome dread of the bite of Cones.\r\nMr. C. Hedley relates[149] that while collecting on a coral reef he\r\nonce rolled over a boulder and exposed a living _C. textile_. Before\r\nhe could pick it up, one of the natives hastily snatched it away, and\r\nexplained, with vivid gesticulations, its hurtful qualities. On no\r\naccount would he permit Mr. Hedley to touch it, but insisted on himself\r\nplacing it in the bottle of spirits.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 27.--A tooth from the radula of _Conus\r\n  imperialis_ L., × 50, showing barb and poison duct.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                  =Mimicry and Protective Coloration.=\r\n\r\nCases of Mimicry, or protective resemblance, when a species otherwise\r\ndefenceless adopts the outward appearance of a better protected\r\nspecies, are rare among the Mollusca. Karl Semper[150] mentions an\r\ninteresting case of the mimicry of _Helicarion tigrinus_ by _Xesta\r\nCumingii_, in the Philippines. It appears that all species of\r\n_Helicarion_ possess the singular property of shaking off the ‘tail’ or\r\nhinder part of the foot, when seized or irritated. Specimens captured\r\nby collectors, _Hel. tigrinus_ amongst them, have succeeded in escaping\r\nfrom the hand, and concealing themselves, by a sort of convulsive leap,\r\namong the dry leaves on the ground. This power of self-amputation must\r\nbe of great value to _Helicarion_, not only as enabling it to escape\r\nfrom the clutch of its enemies, but also as tending to discourage\r\nthem from attempting to capture it at all. Now the genus _Xesta_ is,\r\nin anatomy, very far removed from _Helicarion_, and the majority\r\nof the species are also, as far as the shell is concerned, equally\r\ndistinct. _Xesta Cumingii_, however, has, according to Semper, assumed\r\nthe appearance of a _Helicarion_, the thin shell, the long tail, and\r\nthe mantle lobes reflected over the shell; but it has not the power\r\nof parting with its tail at short notice. It lives associated with\r\n_Helicarion_, and so close is the resemblance between them that, until\r\nSemper pointed out its true position, it had always been classified as\r\na member of that group.\r\n\r\nIn the same passage Semper draws attention to two other cases\r\nof apparent mimicry. The first is another species of _Xesta_\r\n(_mindanaensis_) which closely resembles a species of _Rhysota_\r\n(_Antonii_), a genus not indeed so far removed from _Xesta_ as\r\n_Helicarion_, but, as far as the shell is concerned, well distinguished\r\nfrom it. In this case, however, there is no obvious advantage gained by\r\nthe resemblance, since _Rhysota_ as compared with _Xesta_ is not known\r\nto possess any definite point of superiority which it would be worth\r\nwhile to counterfeit. A second case of resemblance between certain\r\nspecies of the genus _Chloraea_ and the characteristic Philippine group\r\n_Cochlostyla_ will not hold good as affording evidence of mimicry, for\r\n_Chloraea_ is now recognised as a sub-genus of _Cochlostyla_.\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca are not much mimicked by creatures of different\r\norganisation. This appears at first sight strange, since it might have\r\nbeen thought that the strong defensive house of a snail was worth\r\nimitating. Still it is probably not easy for creatures bilaterally\r\nsymmetrical to curl themselves up into an elevated spiral for any\r\nlength of time. One or two instances, however, may be mentioned. The\r\nlarva of a moth belonging to the Psychidae, and occurring in France,\r\nGermany, the Tyrol, and Syria, coils itself up into a sinistral spiral\r\nof three whorls, and is aptly named _Psyche helix_, a kindred species\r\nfrom Italy being known as _Ps. planorbis_.\r\n\r\nAn insect larva (_Cochlophora valvata_) from E. Africa is said to\r\nresemble a _Valvata_ or young _Cyclostoma_. In this case the spiral\r\nis indifferently dextral or sinistral, the ‘shell’ being formed of\r\nmasticated vegetable matter, united together by threads spun by the\r\nlarva. Certain larvae of the Phryganeidae (“Caddis-worms”) enclose\r\nthemselves in houses which more or less resemble a spiral shell, and\r\nhave in some cases actually been described as molluscan; such species,\r\nsome of which belong to _Helicopsyche_, have been noticed in S. Europe,\r\nCeylon, Further India, China, Tasmania, New Zealand, Tennessee, Mexico,\r\nCentral America, Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina, and all[151] possess\r\na dextral ‘shell.’ In all these cases ‘mimicry’ is probably not so much\r\nto be thought of as the practical advantages which accrue to the animal\r\nin question from the spiral form, which gives it greater strength\r\nto resist external blows, and enables it to occupy, during a very\r\ndefenceless portion of its existence, a very small amount of space.\r\n\r\nThe larva of some species of the Syrphidae (_Diptera_) fixes itself on\r\nthe under side of stones in the Tyrol, and closely resembles a small\r\nslug. The naturalist Von Spix, in 1825, described to the Bavarian\r\nAcademy as a new genus of land Mollusca a somewhat similar larval form\r\nfound in decaying wood on the banks of a German lake.[152] Simroth\r\nmentions[153] a curious case as occurring near Grimma. The caterpillars\r\nof certain Microlepidoptera occur on slabs of porphyry, associated\r\nwith a species of _Clausilia_. Besides being of the same colour as the\r\nClausiliae, the caterpillars have actually developed cross lines on the\r\nback, _i.e._ on the side turned away from the rock, in imitation of the\r\nsuture of the mollusc.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested[154] that there is mimicry between _Aeolis\r\npapillosa_ (a common British nudibranch) and _Sagartia troglodytes_\r\n(an Actinian), and also between another species of _Sagartia_ and\r\n_Aeolidiella Alderi_. The facts observed are not sufficient to warrant\r\na decided opinion, but it seems more probable that the Actinian\r\nmimics the nudibranch than _vice versâ_, since _Aeolis_ is known to be\r\nunpalatable to fishes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 28.--=A=, _Strombus mauritianus_ Lam., which\r\n  mimics _Conus_ in shape. =B=, _Conus janus_ Hwass, Mauritius.]\r\n\r\nCertain species of _Strombus_ (_mauritianus_ L., _luhuanus_ L.) show\r\na remarkable similarity in the shape of the shell to that of _Conus_,\r\nso much so, that a tiro would be sure to mistake them, at first sight,\r\nfor Cones. In the case of _S. luhuanus_ at least, this similarity is\r\nincreased by the possession of a remarkably stout brown epidermis.\r\nNow _Conus_ is a flesh-eating genus, armed with very powerful teeth\r\nwhich are capable of inflicting even on man a poisonous and sometimes\r\nfatal wound (see p. 66). _Strombus_, on the other hand, is probably\r\nfrugivorous, and is furnished with weak and inoffensive teeth. It is\r\npossible that this resemblance is a case of ‘mimicry.’ It is quite\r\nconceivable that powerful fishes which would swallow a _Strombus_ whole\r\nand not suffer for it, might acquire a distaste for a Cone, which\r\nwas capable of lacerating their insides after being swallowed. And\r\ntherefore the more like a Cone the _Strombus_ became, the better chance\r\nit would have of being passed over as an ineligible article of food.\r\n\r\n_Protective coloration_ is not uncommon among the Mollusca. _Littorina\r\nobtusata_ is habitually found, on our own coasts, on _Fucus\r\nvesiculosus_, the air-bladders of which it closely resembles in colour\r\nand shape. _Littorina pagodus_, a large and showy species, resembles so\r\nclosely the spongy crumbling rocks of Timor, on which it lives, that it\r\ncan hardly be discerned a pace off. _Helcion pellucidum_, the common\r\nBritish ‘blue limpet,’ lives, when young, almost exclusively on the\r\niridescent leaves of the great Laminariae, with the hues of which its\r\nown conspicuous blue lines harmonise exactly. In mature life, when the\r\n_Helcion_ invariably transfers its place of abode to the lower parts\r\nof the stalk and finally to the root of the Laminaria, which are quite\r\ndestitute of iridescence, these blue lines disappear or become much\r\nless marked.\r\n\r\nThe specimens of _Purpura lapillus_ which occur at Newquay in Cornwall\r\nare banded with rings of colour, especially with black and white, in a\r\nmore varied and striking way than any other specimens that have ever\r\noccurred to my notice. I am inclined to refer this peculiarity to a\r\ntendency towards protective coloration, since the rocks on which the\r\n_Purpura_ occurs are often banded with veins of white and colour, and\r\nvariegated to a very marked extent.\r\n\r\n_Ovula_ varies the colour of its shell from yellow to red, to match the\r\ncolour of the _Gorgonia_ on which it lives. The same is the case with\r\n_Pedicularia_, which occurs on red and yellow coral.\r\n\r\n_Helix desertorum_, by its gray-brown colour, harmonises well with\r\nthe prevailing tint of the desert sands, among which it finds a home.\r\nBenson observes that the gaudy _H. haemastoma_, which lives on the\r\ntrunks of palm-trees in Ceylon, daubs its shell with its excrement.\r\nOur own _Buliminus obscurus_, which lives principally on the trunks of\r\nsmooth-barked trees, daubs its shell with mud, and must often escape\r\nthe observation of its enemies by its striking resemblance to the\r\nlittle knots on the bark, especially of beech trees, its favourite\r\nhaunt. Some species of _Microphysa_, from the West Indies, habitually\r\nencrust their shells with dirt, and the same peculiarity in _Vitrina_\r\nhas already been mentioned. _Ariophanta Dohertyi_ Aldr., a recent\r\ndiscovery from Sumatra, is of a green colour, with a singularly\r\ndelicate epidermis; it is arboreal in its habits, and is almost\r\ninvisible amongst the foliage.[155] Many of our own slugs, according\r\nto Scharff, are coloured protectively according to their surroundings.\r\nA claret-coloured variety of _Arion ater_ occurred to this observer\r\nonly in pine woods, where it harmonised with the general colouring of\r\nthe ground and the pine-needles, while young winter forms of the same\r\nspecies choose for hiding-places the yellow fallen leaves, whose colour\r\nthey closely resemble. _Limax marginatus_ (= _arborum_ Bouch.) haunts\r\ntree trunks, and may easily be mistaken for a piece of bark; _Amalia\r\ncarinata_ lives on and under the ground, and in colour resembles the\r\nmould; _Arion intermedius_ feeds almost exclusively on fungi, to which\r\nits colour, which is white, gray, or light yellow, tends to approximate\r\nit closely; _Geomalacus maculosus_ conceals itself by its striking\r\nresemblance to the lichens which grow on the surface of rocks, and\r\nactually presumes on this resemblance so much as to expose itself,\r\ncontrary to the usual custom of its congeners, to the full light of the\r\nafternoon sun.[156]\r\n\r\nSeveral views have been advanced with regard to the dorsal papillae,\r\nor _cerata_, in the Nudibranchs. Professor W. A. Herdman, who has\r\nexamined a considerable number of our own British species, in which\r\nthese processes occur, is of opinion[157] that they are of two quite\r\ndistinct kinds. In the first place, they may contain large offshoots,\r\nor _diverticula_, of the liver, and thus be directly concerned in the\r\nwork of digestion. This is the case with _Aeolis_ and _Doto_. In the\r\nsecond place, they may be simply lobes on the skin, with no connexion\r\nwith the liver, and no special function to perform. This is the case\r\nwith _Tritonia_, _Ancula_, and _Dendronotus_.\r\n\r\nProfessor Herdman is of opinion that although the cerata may in all\r\ncases aid in respiration to a certain extent, yet that extent is\r\nso small as to be left out of consideration altogether. He regards\r\nthe cerata in both the two classes mentioned above as “of primary\r\nimportance in giving to the animals, by their varied shapes and\r\ncolours, appearances which are in some cases protective, and in others\r\nconspicuous and warning.”\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, _Tritonia plebeia_, which is fairly abundant at\r\nPuffin and Hilbre Is., appears always to be found creeping on the\r\ncolonies of a particular polyp, _Alcyonium digitatum_, and nowhere\r\nelse. The specimens in each colony of the polyp differ noticeably\r\nboth in the matter of colour, and of size, and of varied degrees of\r\nexpansion. The _Tritonia_ differs also, being marked in varied tints\r\nof yellow, brown, blue, gray, black, and opaque white, in such a way\r\nas to harmonise with the varied colours of the _Alcyonium_ upon which\r\nit lives. The cerata on the back of the _Tritonia_ contribute to this\r\ngeneral resemblance. They are placed just at the right distance apart,\r\nand are just the right size and colour, to resemble the crown of\r\ntentacles on the half-expanded polyp.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, _Doto coronata_, which, when examined by itself, is a very\r\nconspicuous animal, with showy, bright-coloured cerata, is found by\r\nProfessor Herdman to haunt no other situations but the under side of\r\nstones and overhanging ledges of rock which are colonised by a hydroid,\r\nknown as _Clava multicornis_. The _Doto_ is masked by the tentacles and\r\nclusters of sporosacs on the zoophyte, with whose colouring and size\r\nits own cerata singularly correspond. A similar and even more deceptive\r\ncorrespondence with environment was noticed in the case of the very\r\nconspicuous _Dendronotus arborescens_.\r\n\r\nIn these cases, the colouring and general shape of the cerata are\r\nprotective, _i.e._ they match their surroundings in such a way as to\r\nenable the animal, in all probability, to escape the observation of\r\nits enemies. According to Professor Herdman, however, the brilliant\r\nand showy coloration of the cerata of _Aeolis_ is not protective\r\nbut ‘warning.’ _Aeolis_ does not hide itself away as if shunning\r\nobservation, like _Doto_, _Tritonia_, and _Dendronotus_; on the\r\ncontrary, it seems perfectly fearless and indifferent to being noticed.\r\nIts cerata are provided with sting-cells, like those of Coelenterata,\r\nat their tips, and its very conspicuousness is a warning to its\r\nenemies that they had better not try to attack it, just as the showy\r\nwhite tail of the skunk acts as a sort of danger-signal to its own\r\nparticular foes. It is important for the _Aeolis_, not merely to _be_\r\nan unpalatable nettle in animal shape, but also to be conspicuous\r\nenough to prevent its being experimented upon as an article of food, in\r\nmistake for something less nasty.\r\n\r\nProfessor Herdman subsequently conducted some experiments[158] with\r\nfishes, with the view of testing his theory that the shapes and colours\r\nof Nudibranchs serve the purpose either of protection or warning, and\r\nbear direct relation to the creature’s edibility. These experiments,\r\non the whole, distinctly tended to confirm the theory. _Aeolis_ was\r\nevidently very nasty, and probably stung the mouths of the fishes who\r\ntried it. For the complete success of the theory, they ought to have\r\nlet it severely alone, but the fish were evidently accustomed to make a\r\ndash at anything that was dropped into their tank. Another conspicuous\r\nmollusc, _Ancula cristata_, was introduced, Professor Herdman and his\r\ncollaborator each commencing operations by eating a live specimen\r\nthemselves. They found the taste pleasant, distinctly like that of an\r\noyster. The fish, however, when the experiments were conducted under\r\nconditions which made the scene as much like ‘real life’ as possible,\r\ndid not agree with Professor Herdman. The _Ancula_ crawled over various\r\nparts of the tank for several days untouched by the fish, who sometimes\r\nwent close to them and looked at them, but never attempted to taste\r\nthem. Experiments with species whose colours were protective, such as\r\n_Dendronotus_, were also conducted, and the decided edibility of these\r\nspecies was established, the fish competing eagerly for them, and\r\ntearing them rapidly to pieces.\r\n\r\nMr. W. Garstang, of the Plymouth Laboratory of the Marine Biological\r\nAssociation, confirms[159] Professor Herdman’s views as to the shape\r\nand colour of Opisthobranchs. _Pleurobranchus membranaceus_ is known\r\nto secrete, on the surface of the body, an acid which reddens blue\r\nlitmus paper. It is, therefore, no doubt distasteful to fish, which\r\nall abominate the taste of acids, and is conspicuously marked with\r\nred-brown and yellowish ‘warning’ colours. _Haminea_ and _Philine_, on\r\nthe other hand, are good to eat, and consequently possess ‘protective’\r\ncoloration. _Runcina Hancocki_, which is of a brown colour, crawls\r\nover brown mud and weeds, but avoids green weeds, on whose surface it\r\nwould appear conspicuous. _Elysia viridis_ varies its colour according\r\nto its habitat, being green when on green weeds, and dark olive,\r\nbrown, or reddish brown, on pools among tufts of littoral algae. Green\r\nspecimens of _Hermaea dendritica_ were kept in captivity, and placed in\r\na dish with green and red sea-weeds. They were never observed crawling\r\nupon the red weed, upon which they would have been very conspicuous.\r\n_Archidoris flammea_ occurred on bright red sponges, to which its\r\ncolour was so closely assimilated that Mr. Garstang at first quite\r\noverlooked it. _Goniodoris castanea_ was found under stones, feeding on\r\ncompound Ascidians (_Botryllus_), which it sufficiently resembled to be\r\nvery inconspicuous in that position.\r\n\r\nAgain, _Jorunna Johnstoni_ lives[160] upon stones on our southern\r\ncoast, associated with a certain sponge (_Halichondria_ sp.), which it\r\nresembles so closely in outline, in colour, in character of surface,\r\nand in its projecting plumes, as to make it very difficult even for\r\nthe careful observer to distinguish the one from the other. And, since\r\nfishes, are known to be distinctly averse to sponges of any kind as an\r\narticle of food, this resemblance must be decidedly to the advantage\r\nof the _Jorunna_. Another Nudibranch (_Calma glaucoides_ A. and H.)\r\nimitates the ova of certain fishes, on which it feeds. Its elongated\r\nand depressed form of body, transparent integuments, and silvery gray\r\npapillae combine to give it a strong resemblance to the spawn of the\r\nfish, which is deposited on stones, the roots of _Laminaria_, etc.[161]\r\n\r\nThe common _Lamellaria perspicua_ appears to possess the power of\r\nprotectively assimilating its colour, markings, etc., to the Ascidians\r\non which it lives. A recent case, occurring off the Isle of Man, is\r\nthus described by Professor Herdman.[162] “The mollusc was on a colony\r\nof _Leptoclinum maculatum_, in which it had eaten a large hole. It lay\r\nin this cavity so as to be flush with the general surface; and its\r\ndorsal integument was not only whitish with small darker marks which\r\nexactly reproduced the appearance of the _Leptoclinum_ surface with\r\nthe ascidiozooids scattered over it, but there were also two larger\r\nelliptical clear marks which looked like the large common cloacal\r\napertures of the Ascidian colony.... Presumably the _Lamellaria_\r\nescapes the observation of its enemies through being mistaken for part\r\nof the _Leptoclinum_ colony; and the _Leptoclinum_, being crowded like\r\na sponge with minute sharp-pointed spicules, is, I suppose, avoided as\r\ninedible (if not actually noxious through some peculiar smell or taste)\r\nby carnivorous animals which might devour such things as the soft\r\nunprotected mollusc.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Parasitic Mollusca=\r\n\r\nVarious grades of parasitism occur among the Mollusca, from the true\r\nparasite, living and nourishing itself on the tissues and secretions of\r\nits host, to simple cases of commensalism. Some authors have divided\r\nthese forms into endo- and ectoparasites, according as they live\r\ninside or outside of their host. Such a division, however, cannot\r\nbe rigidly carried out, for certain forms are indifferently endo-\r\nand ecto-parasitical, while others are ecto-parasitic in the young\r\nform, and become endo-parasitic in the adult. It will be convenient,\r\ntherefore, simply to group the different forms according to the home on\r\nwhich they find a lodgment.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 29.--_Magilus antiquus_ L.: =A=, the adult,\r\n  imbedded in coral, which has been broken away to show the tube;\r\n  =B=, the young (free) form.]\r\n\r\nOn _Sponges_.--_Vulsella_ and _Crenatula_ almost invariably occur\r\nin large masses of irregular shape, boring into sponges. They are\r\nespecially abundant on Porifera from the Red Sea. Corals form a\r\nfavourite home of many species, amongst which are several forms\r\nof _Coralliophila_, _Rhizochilus_, _Leptoconchus_, and _Sistrum_.\r\n_Rhizochilus_ is a very singular creature, inhabiting branching corals.\r\nWhen adult, it forms irregular shelly extensions of both the inner and\r\nouter lips, which adhere to the shafts of the coral, or to the surface\r\nof neighbouring shells; at length the aperture becomes completely\r\nclosed with the exception of the siphonal tube, which becomes long, and\r\nconsists of the same shelly material. The common _Magilus_ (Fig. 29),\r\nfrom the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, in the young form is shaped like\r\na small _Buccinum_. As the coral (_Meandrina_) to which it attaches\r\nitself grows, the _Magilus_ develops at the mouth a long calcareous\r\ntube, the aperture of which keeps pace with the growth of the coral,\r\nand prevents the mollusc from being entombed. The animal lives at the\r\nfree, or outer, end of the tube, and is thus continually shifting its\r\nposition, while the space it abandons becomes completely closed by a\r\nmass of solid calcareous matter. Certain species of _Ovula_ inhabit\r\nGorgonia, assuming the colour, yellow or red, of their host, and, in\r\ncertain cases, developing, probably for prehensile purposes, a pointed\r\nextension of the two extremities of the shell. _Pedicularia_, a form\r\nakin to _Cypraea_, but with a more patulous mouth, inhabits the common\r\n_Corallium rubrum_ of the Mediterranean, and another species has been\r\nnoticed by Graeffe[163] on _Melithaea ochracea_ in Fiji.\r\n\r\nOn _Echinodermata_.--(_a_) _Crinoidea._ _Stylina comatulicola_ lives on\r\n_Comatula mediterranea_, fixed to the outer skin, which it penetrates\r\nby a very long proboscis; the shell is quite transparent.[164] A\r\ncurious case of a fossil parasite has been noticed by Roberts.[165]\r\nA _Calyptrea_-shaped shell named _Platyceras_ always occurred on the\r\nventral side of a crinoid, encompassed by the arms. For some time this\r\nwas thought to afford conclusive proof of the rapacity and carnivorous\r\nhabits of the echinoderm, which had died in the act of seizing its\r\nprey. Subsequent investigations, however, showed that in all the\r\ncases noticed (about 150) the _Platyceras_ covered the anal opening\r\nof the crinoid in such a way that the mouth of the mollusc must have\r\nbeen directly over the orifice of the anus. (_b_) _Asteroidea._ The\r\ncomparatively soft texture of the skin of the starfishes renders\r\nthem a favourite home of various parasites. The brothers Sarasin\r\nnoticed[166] a species of _Stilifer_ encysted on the rays of _Linckia\r\nmultiformis_. Each shell was enveloped up to the apex, which just\r\nprojected from a hole at the top of the cyst. The proboscis was long,\r\nand at its base was a kind of false mantle, which appeared to possess\r\na pumping action. On the under side of the rays of the same starfish\r\noccurred a capuliform mollusc (_Thyca ectoconcha_), furnished with a\r\nmuscular plate, whose cuticular surface was indented in such a way\r\nas to grip the skin of the _Linckia_. This plate was furnished with\r\na hole, through which the pharynx projected into the texture of the\r\nstarfish, acting as a proboscis and apparently furnished with a kind\r\nof pumping or sucking action. Adams and Reeve[167] describe _Pileopsis\r\nastericola_ as living ‘on the tubercle of a starfish,’ and _Stilifer\r\nastericola_, from the coast of Borneo, as ‘living in the body of a\r\nstarfish.’ In the British Museum there is a specimen of _Pileopsis\r\ncrystallina_ ‘in situ’ on the ray of a starfish, (_c_) On the brittle\r\nstarfishes (_Ophiuroidea_) occur several species of _Stiliferina_.\r\n(_d_) _Echinoidea._ Various species of _Stilifer_ occur on the ventral\r\nspines of echinoids, where they probably subsist on the excreta, and\r\nare sometimes found imbedded in the spines themselves. _St. Turtoni_\r\noccurs on the British coasts on several species of _Echinus_, and\r\n_Montacuta substriata_ frequents _Spatangus purpureus_ and certain\r\nspecies of _Echinocardium_, _Cidaris_, and _Brissus_. _Lepton\r\nparasiticum_ has been described from Kerguelen I. on a _Hemiaster_,\r\nand a new genus, _Robillardia_, has recently been established[168]\r\nfor a _Hyalinia_-shaped shell, parasitic on an _Echinus_ from\r\nMauritius. (_e_) _Holothurioidea._ The ‘sea-cucumbers’ afford lodgment\r\nto a variety of curious forms, some of which have experienced such\r\nmodifications that their generic position is by no means established.\r\n_Entoconcha_ occurs fixed by its buccal end to the blood-vessels of\r\ncertain _Synapta_ in the Mediterranean and the Philippines. _Entocolax_\r\nhas been dredged from 180 fath. in Behring’s Straits, attached by its\r\nhead to certain anterior muscles of a _Myriotrochus_.[169] A curious\r\ncase of parasitism is described by Voeltzkow[170] as occurring on\r\na _Synapta_ found between tide-marks on the I. of Zanzibar. In the\r\noesophagus of the _Synapta_ was found a small bivalve (_Entovalva_),\r\nthe animal of which was very large for its shell, and almost entirely\r\nenveloped the valves by its mantle. As many as five specimens occurred\r\non a single _Synapta_. In the gut of the same Holothurian lived a small\r\nunivalve, not creeping freely, but fixed to a portion of the stomach\r\nwall by a very long proboscis which pierced through it into the body\r\ncavity. This proboscis was nearly three times as long as the animal,\r\nand the forward portion of it was set with sharp thorns, no doubt in\r\norder to enable it to retain its hold and resist evacuation. Various\r\nspecies of _Eulima_ have been noticed in every part of the world, from\r\nNorway to the Philippines, both inside and outside Holothurians.[171]\r\n_Stilifer_ also occurs on this section of Echinoderms.[172]\r\n\r\nOn _Annelida_.--_Cochliolepis parasiticus_ has been noticed under\r\nthe scales of _Acoetes lupina_ (a kind of ‘sea-mouse’) in Charleston\r\nHarbour.[173]\r\n\r\nOn _Crustacea_.--A mussel, ⅜ in. long, has been found[174] living\r\nunder the carapace of the common shore-crab (_Carcinus maenas_), and\r\none case has been noticed[175] where two mussels, one of several\r\nmonths’ growth, the other smaller, well secured by their byssi, were\r\nfound under the abdomen of the same species, in such a position as to\r\nforce the appendages apart and askew. These, however, are not so much\r\ncases of parasitism as of involuntary habitat, the mussel no doubt\r\nhaving become involved in the branchiae and the abdomen of the crab in\r\nthe larval form.\r\n\r\nOn _Mollusca_.--A species of _Odostomia_ (_pallida_ Mont.) is found on\r\nour own coasts on the ‘ears’ of _Pecten maximus_, and also[176] on the\r\noperculum of _Turritella communis_. Another species (_O. rissoides_)\r\nfrequently occurs in hiding under beds of mussels, but it is not clear\r\nwhether the habitat is due to parasitism, or simply to the fact that\r\nthe mass of mussels, knitted together and to the rock by the byssi,\r\naffords the _Odostomia_ a safe lurking-place. At Panama the present\r\nwriter found _Crepidula_ (2 sp.) plentiful on the opercula of the\r\ngreat _Strombus galea_ and of _Cerithium irroratum_. In each case the\r\nparasite exactly fitted the size of the operculum, and had assumed its\r\ncolour, dark brown or chestnut. _Amalthea_ is very commonly found on\r\n_Conus_, _Turbo_, and other large shells from the South Pacific, but\r\nthis is probably not a case of parasitism, but simply of convenience of\r\nhabitat, just as young oysters are frequently seen on the carapace and\r\neven on the legs of large crabs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 30.--_Crepidula onyx_ Sowb., parasitic on the\r\n  operculum of _Strombus galeatus_ Swains., Panama.]\r\n\r\nOn _Tunicata_.--_Lamellaria_ deposits its eggs and lives on an Ascidian\r\n(_Leptoclinum_), and the common _Modiolaria marmorata_ lives in\r\ncolonies imbedded in the test of _Ascidia mentula_ and other simple\r\nAscidians.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 31.--Two species of _Eulima_: =A= is sessile\r\n  on the skin of a Holothurian, through which it plunges its\r\n  sucking proboscis (_Pr_); =B= creeps freely in the stomach of a\r\n  Holothurian. (After K. Semper.)]\r\n\r\nSpecial points of interest with regard to parasitic Mollusca relate\r\nto (1) _Colour_. This is in most cases absent, the shell being of\r\na uniform hyaline or milky white. This may be due, in the case of\r\nthe endo-parasitic forms, to absence of light, and possibly, in\r\nthose living outside their host, to some deficiency in the nutritive\r\nmaterial. A colourless shell is not necessarily protective, for\r\nthough a transparent shell might evade detection, a milk-white hue\r\nwould probably be conspicuous. (2) _Modifications of structure._\r\nThese are in many cases considerable. _Entoconcha_ and _Entocolax_\r\nhave no respiratory or circulatory organs, and no known nervous\r\nsystem; _Thyca_ and certain _Stilifer_ possess a curious suctorial\r\napparatus; the foot in many cases has aborted, since the necessity for\r\nlocomotion is reduced to a minimum, and its place is supplied by an\r\nenormous development of the proboscis, which enables the creature to\r\nprovide itself with nutriment without shifting its position. K. Semper\r\nnotices a case where a _Eulima_, whose habitat is the stomach of a\r\nHolothurian, retains the foot unmodified, while a species occurring\r\non the outer skin, but provided with a long proboscis, has lost its\r\nfoot altogether.[177] Special provision for holding on is noticed in\r\ncertain cases, reminding us of similar provision in human parasites.\r\nEyes are frequently, but not always wanting, even in endo-parasitic\r\nforms. A specially interesting modification of structure occurs in\r\n(3) the _Radula_ or ribbon-shaped arrangement of the teeth. In most\r\ncases of parasitism (_Eulima_, _Stilifer_, _Odostomia_, _Entoconcha_,\r\n_Entocolax_, _Magilus_, _Coralliophila_, _Leptoconcha_) it is absent\r\naltogether. In _Ovula_ and _Pedicularia_, genera which are in all\r\nother respects closely allied to _Cypraea_, the radula exhibits marked\r\ndifferences from the typical radula of the Cypraeidae. The formula\r\n(3·1·3) remains the same, but the laterals are greatly produced\r\nand become fimbriated, sometimes at the extremity only, sometimes\r\nalong the whole length. A very similar modification occurs in the\r\nradula of _Sistrum spectrum_ Reeve, a species which is known to live\r\nparasitically on one of the branching corals. Here the laterals differ\r\nfrom those of the typical _Purpuridae_ in being very long and curved at\r\nthe extremity. The general effect of these modifications appears to be\r\nthe production of a radula rather of the type of the vegetable-feeding\r\n_Trochidae_, which may perhaps be regarded as a link in the chain of\r\ngradually-degraded forms which eventually terminate in the absence of\r\nthe organ altogether. The softer the food, the less necessity there\r\nis for strong teeth to tear it; the teeth either become smaller and\r\nmore numerous, or else longer and more slender, and eventually pass\r\naway altogether. It is curious, however, that the same modified form\r\nof radula should appear in species of _Ovula_ (_e.g._ _ovum_) and that\r\nthe same absence of radula should occur in species of _Eulima_ (_e.g._\r\n_polita_) known to be not parasitic. This fact perhaps points back to\r\na time when the ancestral forms of each group are parasitic and whose\r\nradulae were modified or wanting, the modification or absence of that\r\norgan being continued in some of their non-parasitical descendants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             =Commensalism=\r\n\r\nMollusca are concerned in several interesting cases of commensalism,\r\nor the habitual association of two organisms, as distinguished from\r\nparasitism, where one form preys more or less upon the other.\r\n\r\nMr. J. T. Marshall has given[178] an interesting account of the\r\nassociation of _Montacuta ferruginosa_ with _Echinocardium cordatum_.\r\nThe Echinoderm lives in muddy sand in Torbay, at a depth of about 6\r\ninches, and the _Montacuta_ lives in a burrow leading from its ventral\r\nend and running irregularly in a sloping direction for 3 or 4 inches,\r\nthe burrow, which is made by a current from the Echinoderm, being\r\nalmost exactly the width of the _Montacuta_. The _Montacuta_ were\r\nalways arranged in the burrows in order of size, the largest being\r\nclose to the Echinoderm, and the smallest of a string of about six at\r\nthe other end of the burrow. In another part of S. Devon, where the\r\nsand was soft and sloppy, the Echinocardia rise to the surface and\r\ntravel along the sand; in this case the _Montacuta_ were attached to\r\ntheir host by means of a byssus, and were dragged along as it travelled.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Dr. Norman has noted[179] a somewhat similar habitat for\r\n_Lepton squamosum_. This rare little British species was found at\r\nSalcombe, living in the burrows of _Gebia stellata_, in all probability\r\nfeeding upon the secretions from the body of the crustacean. Dr.\r\nNorman suggests that the extreme flatness of the shell of the _Lepton_\r\nis of great advantage in enabling it not to get in the way of the\r\n_Gebia_ as he scuttles up and down his burrow. Another species of\r\n_Lepton_ is found on the coast of Florida in a precisely similar\r\nlocality,[180] while a third species, occurring on the Oregon and\r\nCalifornia coasts, actually attaches itself to the inner surface of the\r\nabdomen of a _Gebia_.[181]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 32.--_Ephippodonta Macdougalli_ Tate, S.\r\n  Australia. =A=, Burrow of prawn, the X indicating the position of\r\n  the mollusc; _sp_, sponge. =B=, Ventral view of _Ephippodonta_;\r\n  _by_, byssus; _f_, foot; _m_, mantle; _mm_, fused mantle borders.\r\n  =C=, View of interior of shells; _h_, hinge; m´m´, adductor\r\n  muscles.

For some reason at present unexplained,\r\nthe burrow of this particular prawn appears to be exceedingly popular\r\nas a habitat for certain bivalves, for, besides two species of\r\n_Ephippodonta_, a _Kellia_ and three _Mylitta_ are found there, and\r\nthere alone. Sometimes the prawn, when the rock is hard, builds a\r\ntunnel of mud upon it, at other times it excavates the soft calciferous\r\nsandstone. “This burrow is lined with a tenacious brown mud, composed\r\nof excrementitious matter; and, in addition to the mud lining, there\r\nis always more or less present an orange-coloured sponge which I have\r\nnever found elsewhere. Upon the mud or sponge, and adhering very\r\nclosely, are found the _Ephippodonta_. They quickly form a pit-like\r\ndepression by means of their foot, and appear almost covered by the\r\nmud.” During the winter months (March-July) the prawn appears to fill\r\nhis burrow, possibly as a provision against stormy weather, with large\r\nquantities of minced seaweed, underneath which immense numbers of\r\nvery young _Ephippodonta_ are found living.[182] The extreme flatness\r\nof the _Ephippodonta_ must be due to the same cause as the flatness\r\nof the _Lepton_ noticed above, namely, the necessity of not impeding\r\nor interfering with the lively motions of the prawn. In the case of\r\n_Lepton_ the two valves close completely and the shell is still very\r\nflat; in _Ephippodonta_, on the other hand, the same result is produced\r\nby the valves being opened to their widest possible extent. As in\r\n_Entovalva_, a continuation of the mantle covers the outer surface of\r\nthe shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               =Variation=\r\n\r\nIt is a familiar experience to the student, not only of the Mollusca,\r\nbut of every branch of animal or vegetable life, to come across\r\nexamples which exhibit certain slight deviations from the type\r\nform as usually understood. These deviations may be more or less\r\npronounced, but, as a rule, a series of forms can be discovered,\r\ngradually leading up to or down from the type. The definition of what\r\nconstitutes a species,--and, still more, the rigid application of\r\nsuch definition--will always remain a difficult task, so long as the\r\npersonal element persists in him who defines.[183] What seems to one\r\nauthority ample ground for distinction of species, another may regard\r\nas of comparatively trivial importance. The practical outcome of these\r\ndivergent views is sufficiently illustrated by the attitude of Mr. F.\r\nP. Marrat on the one hand, and of what may be called the modern French\r\nschool of conchologists on the other. Mr. Marrat holds, or held, that\r\nthe great genus _Nassa_, of which more than 150 species are generally\r\nrecognised, is one shell (species) in an endless variety of forms. The\r\nmodern French school go to the other extreme, and apparently proceed\r\nupon the view that almost any difference in form, however slight, is\r\nsufficient to constitute a separate species.\r\n\r\nIt will be generally admitted, however, that some _structural\r\ndifference_ in the organisation of the animal (as distinct from that\r\nof the shell alone) is necessary for the permanent constitution of\r\nspecific rank.[184] What _amount_ of structural difference is required,\r\nwhat particular organ or organs must exhibit this difference, will\r\ndepend largely upon the idiosyncrasy of the observer. But if this, or\r\nsomething like this definition of a species be accepted, it will follow\r\nthat a so-called ‘variety’ will be a form which exhibits differences\r\nfrom the type which do not amount to permanent structural differences\r\nin the organisation of the animal. The final court of appeal as to what\r\naffords sufficient evidence for ‘permanent structural differences’ will\r\nhave to be, as with Aristotle of old, the judgment of the educated man.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, more to our present purpose to discuss the _causes of\r\nvariation_ than to lay down definitions of what variation is. One of\r\nthe most obvious causes of variation lies in a change or changes in\r\nthe environment. If we may assume, for the moment, that the type form\r\nof a species is the form which is the mean of all the extremes, and\r\nthat this form is the resultant of all the varied forces brought to\r\nbear upon it, whether of food, climate, temperature, competition of\r\nnumbers, soil, light, amount of water, etc., it will follow that any\r\nchange in one or more of these forces, if continuous and considerable,\r\nany change, in other words, of the environment, will produce its\r\neffect upon the organism in question. And this effect will be for\r\nthe better or for the worse, according to the particular nature of\r\nthe change itself as tending towards, or away from, the _optimum_ of\r\nenvironment for the species concerned. Hence may be produced varieties,\r\nmore or less marked according to the gravity of the change, although\r\nit must be noted that at times a change apparently unimportant from\r\nour point of view, will produce very marked results upon the species.\r\nIt is indeed scarcely possible to predict with any certainty, in the\r\npresent state of our knowledge (beyond certain broad results) what will\r\nbe the particular effect upon a species of any given change in its\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Effects of Change in the Environment as tending to produce Variation.=\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Changes in Climate, Temperature, Elevation, etc._--In the\r\neastern basin of the Baltic the marine Mollusca are much more stunted\r\nthan in the western.[185] For instance, _Mytilus edulis_ near Kiel\r\nis 8–9 cm. long, while near Gothland it only attains a length of\r\n3–4 cm. Mollusca living at only a shallow depth (_e.g._ _Tellina\r\nbalthica_, _Mya arenaria_, _Cardium edule_) do not differ much in\r\nsize in different parts of the Baltic, but in the far eastern basin\r\nthe calcareous layers of the shells of _Mya arenaria_ and _Tellina\r\nbalthica_ are extraordinarily thin, and disappear very rapidly\r\nafter death, leaving only the cuticular membrane, still united by\r\nthe ligament, in a perfect state of preservation. These remarkable\r\nvariations are no doubt to a large extent due to the violent changes\r\nof temperature which are experienced in the Baltic, and by which the\r\nsteady development of the animals in question is interrupted and\r\nthrown out of gear. The same species occur on the coasts of Greenland\r\nand Iceland, where they attain a considerably larger size than in the\r\nBaltic, in spite of the lower mean temperature, probably because their\r\ndevelopment is not interrupted by any sudden change from cold to heat\r\nor _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nKarl Semper has shown that _Limnaea stagnalis_ is developed, lives\r\nand feeds best in a mean temperature of about 20° C. (= 68° F.). This\r\nmean, however, must not be the mean of two distant extremes, for the\r\n_Limnaea_ cannot digest its food and grow in a temperature which is\r\nless than 14° or 15° C. (= 57° or 59° F.), or more than 30° to 32° C.\r\n(= 86° to 90° F.). In certain localities, therefore, the interruption\r\nto the growth of this species must be serious and prolonged, and may\r\ntend towards the production of more or less dwarfed varieties. Thus\r\nspecimens from Malham Tarn, a lake in Yorkshire 1250 feet above the\r\nsea, are permanently dwarfed, and have a very thin and fragile shell.\r\n_Limnaea peregra_ in the Pyrenees, Alps, and Himalayas is generally of\r\na very delicate form and dwarfed habit, while the small variety known\r\nas _lacustris_ occurs, according to Jeffreys, only in mountain lakes in\r\nZetland, Scotland, Ireland, and N. England. Specimens brought by Mr.\r\nBateson from lakes near the Sea of Aral, which are salt for some months\r\nand comparatively fresh for others, exhibit clearly the effect of\r\nchanges in the environment (Figs. 33 and 34). Excess of heat produces\r\nsimilar results to excess of cold. _L. peregra_ var. _thermalis_,\r\nfound in the warm springs of the Pyrenees and the Vosges, and the var.\r\n_geisericola_, from the hot water of the Iceland geysers, are alike\r\nthin and dwarfed forms.\r\n\r\nMany instances may be given of ‘varieties due to locality.’ In some of\r\nthese, the cause which predisposes towards variation can be inferred\r\nwith some approach to certainty, in others we must be content to note\r\nthe fact, without at present being able to perceive its explanation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 33.--Four examples of _Limnaea peregra_\r\n  Müll., from salt marshes near the Sea of Aral, showing different\r\n  effects produced by abnormal conditions of life.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 34.--Four examples of _Limnaea stagnalis_\r\n  L., from marshes in the Aral district which are salt for several\r\n  months in the year, illustrating variation produced by changes in\r\n  the environment. × ½.]\r\n\r\nDesert specimens of widely distributed species, _e.g._ _Helix pomatia_,\r\n_H. niciensis_, _H. pisana_, _Leucochroa candidissima_ are much thicker\r\nthan the type, and tend to lose all trace of coloured bands. These\r\nmodifications are clearly the means of preventing evaporation of\r\nmoisture, the dull white or grayish brown colour being calculated to\r\nabsorb the smallest possible amount of heat. Desert shells in all parts\r\nof the world (_e.g._ N. Africa, Arabia, Central Asia, S. Africa, W.\r\nAmerica) have been noticed to exhibit these peculiarities.\r\n\r\nA very singular case of the reverse process, _i.e._ the production\r\nof darkened forms of shell through cold, has been noticed by Fischer\r\nas characteristic of the marine shells of the west coast of South\r\nAmerica.[186] This melanism is especially noticeable in _Trochus_,\r\n_Turbo_, _Chiton_, _Mitra_, and _Pleurotoma_, and is attested by the\r\nspecific names, not merely expressive of actual blackness (_e.g._\r\n_nigerrimus_, _ater_, _atramentarius_, _maurus_), but also of a\r\ngenerally lugubrious tone (_e.g._ _moestus_, _funebralis_, _tristis_,\r\n_lugubris_, _luctuosus_). It is highly probable that this concurrence\r\nof specific melanism (which stands quite alone in the world) is due\r\nto the cold polar current which impinges on the Chilian coasts, for\r\nthe same genera occur on the opposite shores of the continent without\r\nexhibiting any trace whatever of this mournful characteristic.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known fact, attested by many observers, that our common\r\n_Limax agrestis_ as well as the young of _Arion ater_ become decidedly\r\ndarker in summer than in winter. If these slugs were accustomed to\r\ndisport themselves in the sun, it might have been suggested that this\r\nincreased darkness of colour tended to absorb more of the heat rays.\r\nBut since this is not the case, the result is probably due to some\r\nunexplained effect of higher temperature. According to Lessona and\r\nPollonera, the length of the keel in _Limax arborum_ varies greatly in\r\ndifferent parts of Italy, being shorter in specimens from low ground,\r\nbut much longer in those inhabiting more elevated regions. The longer\r\nthe keel, the more obscure the colouring becomes, so that in the\r\nUpper Alps of Piedmont individuals are practically black. Roebuck has\r\nobserved that Scottish specimens of this same slug are much darker\r\nand less translucent than English forms. According to Simroth, our\r\ncommon black slug, _Arion ater_, is a northern type, which in more\r\nsouthern latitudes assumes the form known as _A. rufus_. Similarly\r\n_Limax maximus_ “in its northern form _cinereo-niger_ is almost wholly\r\nblack, but in the more genial climate of Italy develops a series of\r\nbrilliantly coloured and strikingly marked variations which have\r\nreceived numerous distinctive names from Italian limacologists.”[187]\r\nAccording to Scharff, however[188] (who regards the colours of slugs as\r\nin the main protective), these dark forms are by no means exclusively\r\nnorthern, being found equally on the parched plains of Spain and\r\nPortugal, and in the bleak climate of Norway. The same authority\r\nobserves that similar forms occur both in the dry regions of E.\r\nGermany, and in the very humid district of western Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt appears unquestionable that marine genera from high northern\r\nlatitudes are provided with shells of uniform colour, or whitish with a\r\npale brown epidermis; spots, bands, or stripes seldom occur. The arctic\r\nforms of _Buccinum_, _Trophon_, _Chrysodomus_, _Margarita_, _Crenella_,\r\n_Leda_, _Yoldia_, _Astarte_ illustrate this fact. In the more temperate\r\nseas of Europe, colours tend on the whole to increase, although there\r\nare certain genera (_e.g._ _Pecten_) which are not more brightly\r\ncoloured in Mediterranean than in Icelandic waters.\r\n\r\nLand Mollusca inhabiting the mainland of a continent not unfrequently\r\nbecome smaller when they have spread to adjacent islands where perhaps\r\nthe rainfall is less abundant or the soil and food-supply less nicely\r\nadjusted to their wants. _Orthalicus undatus_ is decidedly larger on\r\nthe mainland of S. America than on the adjacent islands of Trinidad and\r\nGrenada. Specimens of _Bulimulus exilis_ from Barbados are invariably\r\nbroader and more obese than those from S. Thomas, while those from the\r\nvolcanic island of S. Lucia, where lime is deficient, are small and\r\nvery slender. _Streptaxis deformis_, as occurring at Trinidad, is only\r\nhalf the size of specimens from Georgetown, Demerara.[189]\r\n\r\nCertain localities appear, for some unexplained reason, to be\r\nparticularly favourable to the production of albino varieties. The\r\nneighbourhood of Lewes, in Sussex, has produced no fewer than fourteen\r\nof these forms of land Mollusca and five of fresh-water.[190]\r\n\r\nOur common _Helix aspersa_, as found near Bristol, is said to be ‘dark\r\ncoloured’; about Western-super-mare ‘brown, with black markings’;\r\nnear Bath ‘very pale and much mottled’; at Cheddar ‘very solid and\r\nlarge.’[191] Sometimes the same kind of variation is exhibited\r\nby different species in the same locality. Thus specimens of _H.\r\naspersa_, _H. nemoralis_, and _H. hortensis_, taken from the same\r\nbank at Torquay, presented a straw-coloured tinge of ground colour,\r\nwith red-brown bands or markings. Trochiform _H. nemoralis_ and _H.\r\narbustorum_, sinistral _H. hortensis_ and _H. aspersa_, sinistral _H.\r\naspersa_ and _H. virgata_, and similarly banded forms of _H. caperata_\r\nand _H. virgata_, have been taken together.[192]\r\n\r\nThe immediate neighbourhood of the sea appears frequently to have the\r\neffect of dwarfing land Mollusca. Thus the var. _conoidea_ of _Helix\r\naspersa_, which is small, conical, with a compressed mouth, occurs\r\n‘on sandhills and cliffs at the seaside.’ The varieties _conica_ and\r\n_nana_ of _Helix hispida_ are found ‘near the sea.’ _Helix virgata_\r\nis exceedingly small in similar localities, and tends to become\r\nunicoloured. _H. caperata_ var. _Gigaxii_, a small depressed form,\r\noccurs at ‘Sandwich and Falmouth.’[193] Sometimes, however, the exact\r\nopposite is the case, for _H. nemoralis_ var. _major_, which is\r\n‘much larger’ than the type, occurs on ‘sandhills and downs’ and is\r\n‘remarkably large in the I. of Arran, Co. Galway.’ The dwarf form of\r\n_Limnaea peregra_ known as _maritima_ appears to be confined to the\r\nneighbourhood of the sea.\r\n\r\nDwarfing of the shell seems frequently to be the result of an elevated\r\nlocality, not perhaps so much as the direct consequence of purer air\r\nand less barometric pressure, as of changes in the character of the\r\nfood supply and in the humidity of the air. Several species of _Helix_\r\nhave a variety _minor_ which is characteristic of an Alpine habitat.\r\n_Helix arbustorum_ var. _alpestris_, which is scarcely two-thirds the\r\nsize of the type, occurs on the Swiss Alps in the region of perpetual\r\nsnow. Sometimes a very slight elevation is sufficient to produce the\r\ndwarfed form. At Tenby the type form of _Helix pisana_ is scattered in\r\ncountless numbers over the sandhills just above high-water mark. At the\r\nextreme western end of these sandhills rises abruptly to a height of\r\nover 100 feet the promontory known as Giltar Head, the vegetation of\r\nwhich is entirely distinct from that of the burrows below. There is a\r\ncolony of _H. pisana_ at the end of Giltar, all of which are devoid of\r\nthe characteristic markings of the typical form, and most are dwarfed\r\nand stunted in growth.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the same variety will be found to be produced by\r\nsurroundings of very different nature. Thus the var. _alpestris_, of\r\n_H. arbustorum_ mentioned above, besides being characteristic of high\r\nAlpine localities, also occurs abundantly in low marshes at Hoddesdon\r\non the River Lea. _Helix pulchella_ var. _costata_, according to\r\nJeffreys, is found in dry and sandy places, often under loose stones\r\nand bricks on walls, while other authorities have noticed it in wet and\r\ndry localities quite indifferently.\r\n\r\nSometimes the production of a variety may be traced to the intrusion\r\nof some other organism. According to Brot, nine-tenths of the _Limnaea\r\nperegra_ inhabiting a certain pond near Geneva, were, during one\r\nseason, afflicted with a malformation of the base of the columella.\r\nThis deformity coincided with the appearance, in the same waters, of\r\nextraordinary numbers of _Hydra viridis_. The next season, when the\r\n_Hydra_ disappeared, the next generation of _Limnaea_ was found to\r\nhave resumed its normal form.\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed that a form of _Helix caperata_ with a flattened\r\nspire and wide umbilicus is restricted to tilled fields, especially the\r\nborders of clover fields, while a form with a more elevated spire and\r\nmore compact whorls occurs exclusively in open downs and uncultivated\r\nplaces. The Rev. S. S. Pearce accounts[194] for this divergence by the\r\nexplanation that the flatter spire enables the shell of the fields\r\nto creep about more easily under the leaves or matted weeds, seldom\r\nrequiring to crawl up a stalk or stem, while on the short turf of the\r\ndowns and pastures the smaller and more rounded shell enables the\r\nanimal to manoeuvre in and out of the blades of grass, and even to\r\ncrawl up them with considerable activity. The same writer endeavours\r\nto explain the causes which regulate the distribution of _H. caperata_\r\nvar. _ornata_. He found that this variety (dark bands on a white\r\nground) occurred almost exclusively on downs which were fed upon by\r\nsheep, associated with the common or mottled form, while the latter\r\nform alone occurred in localities where sheep were not accustomed to\r\nfeed. Assuming then, as is probably the case, that sheep, in the course\r\nof their close pasturing, devour many small snails, he believes that\r\nindividuals of the more conspicuous form _ornata_ were more likely\r\nto be noticed, and therefore avoided, by the sheep, than the mottled\r\nform, which would more easily escape their observation. Hence the var.\r\n_ornata_ is due to the advantage which strikingly coloured individuals\r\nobtained owing to their conspicuous habit, as compared with the typical\r\nform, which would be less readily detected.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Changes in Soil, Station, Character of Water, etc._--A\r\ndeficiency of lime in the composition of the soil of any particular\r\nlocality produces very marked effects upon the shells of the Mollusca\r\nwhich inhabit it; they become small and very thin, occasionally almost\r\ntransparent. The well-known var. _tenuis_ of _Helix aspersa_ occurs\r\non downs in the Channel Islands where calcareous material is scarce.\r\nFor similar reasons, _H. arbustorum_ develops a var. _fusca_, which is\r\ndepressed, very thin, and transparent, at Scilly, and also at Lunna I.,\r\nE. Zetland.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 35.--19 specimens of _Purpura lapillus_ L.,\r\n  Great Britain, illustrating variation.\r\n\r\n   (1) Felixstowe, sheltered coast; (2), (3) Newquay, on veined\r\n   and coloured rock; (4) Herm, rather exposed; (5) Solent, very\r\n   sheltered; (6) Land’s End, exposed rocks, small food supply;\r\n   (7) Scilly, exposed rocks, fair food supply; (8) St. Leonards,\r\n   flat mussel beds at extreme low water; (9) Robin Hood’s Bay,\r\n   sheltered under boulders, good food supply; (10) Rhoscolyn, on\r\n   oyster bed, 4–7 fath.

All from\r\n   the author’s collection, except (10).]\r\n\r\nThe common dog-whelk (_Purpura lapillus_) of our own coasts is an\r\nexceedingly variable species, and in many cases the variations may be\r\nshown to bear a direct relation to the manner of life (Fig. 35). Forms\r\noccurring in very exposed situations, _e.g._ Land’s End, outer rocks of\r\nthe Scilly Is., coasts of N. Devon and Yorkshire, are stunted, with a\r\nshort spire and relatively large mouth, the latter being developed in\r\norder to increase the power of adherence to the rock and consequently\r\nof resistance to wave force. On the other hand, shells occurring in\r\nsheltered situations, estuaries, narrow straits, or even on open coasts\r\nwhere there is plenty of shelter from the waves, are comparatively\r\nof great size, with a well-developed, sometimes produced spire, and\r\na mouth small in proportion to the area of shell surface. In the\r\naccompanying figure, the specimens from the Conway estuary and the\r\nSolent (12, 5) well illustrate this latter form of shell, while that\r\nfrom exposed rocks is illustrated by the specimens from Robin Hood’s\r\nBay (13, 14). Had these specimens occurred alone, or had they been\r\nbrought from some distant and unexplored region, they must inevitably\r\nhave been described as two distinct species.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 36.--Valves of _Cardium edule_ from the four\r\n  upper terraces of Shumish Kul, a dry salt lake adjacent to the\r\n  Aral Sea. (After Bateson.)]\r\n\r\nMr. W. Bateson has made[195] some observations on the shells of\r\n_Cardium edule_ taken from a series of terraces on the border of\r\ncertain salt lakes which once formed a portion of the Sea of Aral.\r\nAs these lakes gradually became dry, the water they contained became\r\nsalter, and thus the successive layers of dead shells deposited on\r\ntheir borders form an interesting record of the progressive variation\r\nof this species under conditions which, in one respect at least, can\r\nbe clearly appreciated. At the same time the diminishing volume of\r\nwater, and the increasing average temperature, would not be without\r\ntheir effect. It was found that the principal changes were as follows:\r\nthe thickness, and consequently the weight, of the shells became\r\ndiminished, the size of the beaks was reduced, the shell became highly\r\ncoloured, and diminished considerably in size, and the breadth of the\r\nshells increased in proportion to their length (Fig. 36). Shells of\r\nthe same species of _Cardium_, occurring in Lake Mareotis, were found\r\nto exhibit very similar variations as regards colour, size, shape, and\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\n_Unio pictorum_ var. _compressa_ occurs near Norwich at two similar\r\nlocalities six or seven miles distant from one another, under\r\ncircumstances which tend to show that similar conditions have produced\r\nsimilar results. The form occurs where the river, by bending sharply\r\nin horse-shoe shape, causes the current to rush across to the opposite\r\nside and form an eddy near the bank on the outside of the bend. Just\r\nat the edge of the sharp current next the eddy the shells are found,\r\nthe peculiar form being probably due to the current continually washing\r\naway the soft particles of mud and compelling the shell to elongate\r\nitself in order to keep partly buried at the bottom.[196]\r\n\r\nThe rivers Ouse and Foss, which unite just below York, are rivers\r\nof strikingly different character, the Ouse being deep, rapid, with\r\na bare, stony bottom, and little vegetable growth, and receiving a\r\ngood deal of drainage, while the Foss is shallow, slow, muddy, full\r\nof weeds and with very little drainage. In the Foss, fine specimens\r\nof _Anodonta anatina_ occur, lustrous, with beautifully rayed shells.\r\nA few yards off, in the Ouse, the same species of _Anodonta_ is dull\r\nbrown in colour, its interior clouded, the beaks and epidermis often\r\ndeeply eroded. Precisely the same contrast is shown in specimens of\r\n_Unio tumidus_, taken from the same rivers, Ouse specimens being also\r\nslightly curved in form. Just above Yearsley Lock in the Foss, _Unio\r\ntumidus_ occurs, but always dwarfed and malformed, a result probably\r\ndue to the effect of rapidly running water upon a species accustomed to\r\nlive in still water.[197] Simroth records the occurrence of remarkably\r\ndistorted varieties in two species of _Aetheria_ which lived in swift\r\nfalls of the River Congo.[198]\r\n\r\nA variety of _Limnaea peregra_ with a short spire and rather strong,\r\nstoutly built shell occurs in Lakes Windermere, Derwentwater, and\r\nLlyn-y-van-fach. It lives adhering to stones in places where there are\r\nvery few weeds, its shape enabling it to withstand the surf of these\r\nlarge lakes, to which the ordinary form would probably succumb.[199]\r\n\r\nScalariform specimens of _Planorbis_ are said to occur most commonly in\r\nwaters which are choked by vegetation, and it has been shown that this\r\nform of shell is able to make its way through masses of dense weed much\r\nmore readily than specimens of normal shape.\r\n\r\nContinental authorities have long considered _Limnaea peregra_ and\r\n_L. ovata_ as two distinct species. Hazay, however, has succeeded in\r\nrearing specimens of so-called _peregra_ from the ova of _ovata_, and\r\nso-called _ovata_ from the ova of _peregra_, simply by placing one\r\nspecies in running water, and the other in still water.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. J. S. Gibbons[200] certain species of _Littorina_, in\r\ntropical and sub-tropical regions, are confined to water more or less\r\nbrackish, being incapable of living in pure salt water. “I have met,”\r\nsays Mr. Gibbons, “with three of these species, and in each case they\r\nhave been distinguished from the truly marine species by the extreme\r\n(comparative) thinness of their shells, and by their colouring being\r\nricher and more varied; they are also usually more elaborately marked.\r\nThey are to be met with under three different conditions--(1) in\r\nharbours and bays where the water is salt with but a slight admixture\r\nof fresh water; (2) in mangrove swamps where salt and fresh water mix\r\nin pretty equal volume; (3) on dry land, but near a marsh or the dry\r\nbed of one.\r\n\r\n“_L. intermedia_ Reeve, a widely diffused E. African shell, attaches\r\nitself by a thin pellicle of dried mucus to grass growing by the margin\r\nof slightly brackish marshes near the coast, resembling in its mode\r\nof suspension the Old World _Cyclostoma_. I have found it in vast\r\nnumbers in situations where, during the greater part of the year,\r\nit is exposed to the full glare of an almost vertical sun, its only\r\nsource of moisture being a slight dew at night-time. The W. Indian _L.\r\nangulifera_ Lam., and a beautifully coloured E. African species (_? L.\r\ncarinifera_), are found in mangrove swamps; they are, however, less\r\nindependent of salt water than the last.”\r\n\r\nMr. Gibbons goes on to note that brackish water species (although not\r\nso solid as truly marine species) tend to become more solid as the\r\nwater they inhabit becomes less salt. This is a curious fact, and the\r\nreverse of what one would expect. Specimens of _L. intermedia_ on\r\nstakes at the mouth of the Lorenço Marques River, Delagoa Bay, are\r\nmuch smaller, darker, and more fragile, than those living on grass a\r\nfew hundred yards away. _L. angulifera_ is unusually solid and heavy\r\nat Puerto Plata (S. Domingo) among mangroves, where the water is in a\r\ngreat measure fresh; at Havana and at Colon, where it lives on stakes\r\nin water but slightly brackish, it is thinner and smaller and also\r\ndarker coloured.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Changes in the Volume of Water._--It has long been known that\r\nthe largest specimens, _e.g._ of _Limnaea stagnalis_ and _Anodonta\r\nanatina_, only occurred in pieces of water of considerable size.\r\nRecent observation, however, has shown conclusively that the volume of\r\nwater in which certain species live has a very close relation to the\r\nactual size of their shells, besides producing other effects. _Lymnaea\r\nmegasoma_, when kept in an aquarium of limited size, deposited eggs\r\nwhich hatched out; this process was continued in the same aquarium for\r\nfour generations in all, the form of the shell of the last generation\r\nhaving become such that an experienced conchologist gave it as his\r\nopinion that the first and last terms of the series could have no\r\npossible specific relation to one another. The size of the shell\r\nbecame greatly diminished, and in particular the spire became very\r\nslender.[201]\r\n\r\nThe same species being again kept in an aquarium under similar\r\nconditions, it was found that the third generation had a shell only\r\nfour-sevenths the length of their great grandparents. It was noticed\r\nalso that the sexual capacities of the animals changed as well. The\r\nliver was greatly reduced, and the male organs were entirely lost.[202]\r\n\r\nK. Semper conducted some well-known experiments bearing on this point.\r\nHe separated[203] specimens of _Limnaea stagnalis_ from the same mass\r\nof eggs as soon as they were hatched, and placed them simultaneously in\r\nbodies of water varying in volume from 100 to 2000 cubic centimetres.\r\nAll the other conditions of life, and especially the food supply, were\r\nkept at the known optimum. He found, in the result, that the size of\r\nthe shell varied directly in proportion to the volume of the water\r\nin which it lived, and that this was the case, whether an individual\r\nspecimen was kept alone in a given quantity of water, or shared it with\r\nseveral others. At the close of 65 days the specimens raised in 100\r\ncubic cm. of water were only 6 mm. long, those in 250 cubic cm. were 9\r\nmm. long, those in 600 cubic cm. were 12 mm. long, while those kept in\r\n2000 cubic cm. attained a length of 18 mm. (Fig. 37).\r\n\r\nAn interesting effect of a sudden fall of temperature was noticed by\r\nSemper in connection with the above experiments. Vessels of unequal\r\nsize, containing specimens of the _Limnaea_, happened to stand before a\r\nwindow at a time when the temperature suddenly fell to about 55° F. The\r\nsun, which shone through the window, warmed the water in the smaller\r\nvessels, but had no effect upon the temperature of the larger. The\r\nresult was, that the _Limnaea_ in 2000 cubic cm., which ought to have\r\nbeen 10 mm. long when 25 days old, were scarcely longer, at the end of\r\nthat period, than those which had lived in the smaller vessels, but\r\nwhose water had been sufficiently warm.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 37.--Four equally old shells of _Limnaea\r\n  stagnalis_, hatched from the same mass of ova, but reared in\r\n  different volumes of water: =A= in 100, =B= in 250, =C= in 600,\r\n  and =D= in 2000 cubic centimetres.

Semper.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n   USES OF SHELLS FOR MONEY, ORNAMENT, AND FOOD--CULTIVATION OF THE\r\n    OYSTER, MUSSEL, AND SNAIL--SNAILS AS MEDICINE--PRICES GIVEN FOR\r\n                                SHELLS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe employment of shells as a medium of exchange was exceedingly common\r\namongst uncivilised tribes in all parts of the world, and has by no\r\nmeans yet become obsolete. One of the commonest species thus employed\r\nis the ‘money cowry’ (_Cypraea moneta_, L.), which stands almost alone\r\nin being used entire, while nearly all the other forms of shell money\r\nare made out of portions of shells, thus requiring a certain amount of\r\nlabour in the process of formation.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest mentions of the cowry as money occurs in an ancient\r\nHindoo treatise on mathematics, written in the seventh century A.D.\r\nA question is propounded thus: ‘the ¼ of 1/16 of ⅕ of ¾ of ⅔ of ½ a\r\ndramma was given to a beggar by one from whom he asked an alms; tell\r\nme how many cowry shells the miser gave.’ In British India about 4000\r\nare said to have passed for a shilling, but the value appears to differ\r\naccording to their condition, poor specimens being comparatively\r\nworthless. According to Reeve[204] a gentleman residing at Cuttack is\r\nsaid to have paid for the erection of his bungalow entirely in cowries.\r\nThe building cost him 4000 Rs. sicca (about £400), and as 64 cowries =\r\n1 pice, and 64 pice = 1 rupee sicca, he paid over 16,000,000 cowries in\r\nall.\r\n\r\nCowries are imported to England from India and other places for the\r\npurposes of exportation to West Africa, to be exchanged for native\r\nproducts. The trade, however, appears to be greatly on the decrease. At\r\nthe port of Lagos, in 1870, 50,000 cwts. of cowries were imported.[205]\r\n\r\nA banded form of _Nerita polita_ was used as money in certain parts of\r\nthe South Pacific. The sandal-wood imported into the China market is\r\nlargely obtained from the New Hebrides, being purchased of the natives\r\nin exchange for _Ovulum angulosum_, which they especially esteem as an\r\nornament. Sometimes, as in the Duke of York group, the use of shell\r\nmoney is specially restricted to certain kinds of purchase, being\r\nemployed there only in the buying of swine.\r\n\r\nAmong the tribes of the North-West coasts of America the common\r\n_Dentalium indianorum_ used to form the standard of value, until it\r\nwas superseded, under the auspices of the Hudson’s Bay Company, by\r\nblankets. A slave was valued at a fathom of from 25 to 40 of these\r\nshells, strung lengthwise. Inferior or broken specimens were strung\r\ntogether in a similar way, but were less highly esteemed; they\r\ncorresponded more to our silver and copper coins, while the strings of\r\nthe best shells represented gold.\r\n\r\nThe _wampum_ of the eastern coast of North America differed from all\r\nthese forms of shell money, in that it required a laborious process\r\nfor its manufacture. Wampum consisted of strings of cylindrical beads,\r\neach about a quarter of an inch in length and half that breadth. The\r\nbeads were of two colours, white and purple, the latter being the more\r\nvaluable. Both were formed from the common clam, _Venus mercenaria_,\r\nthe valves of which are often stained with purple at the lower margins,\r\nwhile the rest of the shell is white. Cut small, ground down, and\r\npierced, these shells were converted into money, which appears to have\r\nbeen current along the whole sea-board of North America from Maine to\r\nFlorida, and on the Gulf Coast as far as Central America, as well as\r\namong the inland tribes east of the Mississippi. Another kind of wampum\r\nwas made from the shells of _Busycon carica_ and _B. perversum_. By\r\nstaining the wampum with various colours, and disposing these colours\r\nin belts in various forms of arrangement, the Indians were able to\r\npreserve records, send messages, and keep account of any kind of event,\r\ntreaty, or transaction.\r\n\r\nAnother common form of money in California was _Olivella biplicata_,\r\nstrung together by rubbing down the apex. Button-shaped disks cut from\r\n_Saxidomus arata_ and _Pachydesma crassatelloides_, as well as oblong\r\npieces of _Haliotis_, were employed for the same purpose, when strung\r\ntogether in lengths of several yards.\r\n\r\n“There is a curious old custom,” writes Mr. W. Anderson Smith,[206]\r\n“that used formerly to be in use in this locality [the western coast\r\nof Scotland], and no doubt was generally employed along the sea-board,\r\nas the most simple and ready means of arrangement of bargains by a\r\nnon-writing population. That was, when a bargain was made, each party\r\nto the transaction got one half of a bivalve shell--such as mussel,\r\ncockle, or oyster--and when the bargain was implemented, the half that\r\nfitted exactly was delivered up as a receipt! Thus a man who had a box\r\nfull of unfitted shells might be either a creditor or a debtor; but the\r\nbox filled with fitted shells represented receipted accounts. Those who\r\nknow the difficulty of fitting the valves of some classes of bivalves\r\nwill readily acknowledge the value of this arrangement.”\r\n\r\nShells are employed for use and for ornament by savage--and even by\r\ncivilised--tribes in all parts of the world. The natives of Fiji\r\nthread the large _Turbo argyrostoma_ and _crenulatus_ as weights at\r\nthe edge of their nets, and also employ them as sinkers. A _Cypraea\r\ntigris_ cut into two halves and placed round a stone, with two or three\r\nshowy _Oliva_ at the sides, is used as a bait for cuttles. _Avicula\r\nmargaritifera_ is cut into scrapers and knives by this and several\r\nother tribes. Breast ornaments of _Chama_, grouped with _Solarium\r\nperspectivum_ and _Terebra duplicata_ are common among the Fijians, who\r\nalso mount the _Avicula_ on a backing of whales’ teeth sawn in two,\r\nfor the same purpose. The great Orange Cowry (_Cypraea aurantiaca_)\r\nis used as a badge of high rank among the chieftains. One of the\r\nmost remarkable Fijian industries is the working of whales’ teeth to\r\nrepresent this cowry, as well as the commoner _C. talpa_, which is more\r\neasily imitated.\r\n\r\nAmong the Solomon islanders, cowries are used to ornament their shields\r\non great field days, and split cowries are worn as a necklace, to\r\nrepresent human teeth. Small bunches of _Terebellum subulatum_ are\r\nworn as earrings, and a large valve of _Avicula_ is employed as a head\r\nornament in the centre of a fillet. The same islanders ornament the\r\nraised prows of their canoes, as well as the inside of the stern-post,\r\nwith a long row of single _Natica_.\r\n\r\nThe native Papuans employ shells for an immense variety of purposes.\r\nCirclets for the head are formed of rows of _Nassa gibbosula_, rubbed\r\ndown till little but the mouth remains. Necklaces are worn which\r\nconsist of strings of _Oliva_, young _Avicula_, _Natica melanostoma_,\r\nopercula of _Turbo_, and valves of a rich brown species of _Cardium_,\r\npendent at the end of strings of the seeds known as Job’s tears.\r\n_Struthiolaria_ is rubbed down until nothing but the mouth is left,\r\nand worn in strings round the neck. This is remarkable, since\r\n_Struthiolaria_ is not a native Papuan shell, and indeed occurs no\r\nnearer than New Zealand. Sections of _Melo_ are also worn as a breast\r\nornament, dependent from a necklace of cornelian stones. _Cypraea\r\nerosa_ is used to ornament drinking bowls, and _Ovulum ovum_ is\r\nattached to the native drums, at the base of a bunch of cassowary\r\nfeathers, as well as being fastened to the handle of a sago-beater.\r\n\r\nIn the same island, the great _Turbo_ and _Conus millepunctatus_ are\r\nground down to form bracelets, which are worn on the biceps. The\r\ncrimson lip of _Strombus luhuanus_ is cut into beads and perforated\r\nfor necklaces. Village elders are distinguished by a single _Ovulum\r\nverrucosum_, worn in the centre of the forehead. The thick lip of\r\n_Cassis cornuta_ is ground down to form nose pieces, 4½ inches long.\r\nFragments of a shell called _Kaïma_ (probably valves of a large\r\n_Spondylus_) are worn suspended from the ears, with little wisps of\r\nhair twisted up and thrust through a hole in the centre. For trumpets,\r\n_Cassis cornuta_, _Triton tritonis_, and _Ranella lampas_ are used,\r\nwith a hole drilled as a mouthpiece in one of the upper whorls. Valves\r\nof _Batissa_, _Unio_, and _Mytilus_ are used as knives for peeling\r\nyams. Spoons for scooping the white from the cocoa-nut are made from\r\n_Avicula margaritifera_. _Melo diadema_ is used as a baler in the\r\ncanoes.[207]\r\n\r\nIn the Sandwich Islands _Melampus luteus_ is worn as a necklace, as\r\nwell as in the Navigator Islands. A very striking necklace, in the\r\nlatter group, is formed of the apices of a _Nautilus_, rubbed down to\r\nshow the nacre. The New Zealanders use the green opercula of a Turbo,\r\na small species of _Venus_, and _Cypraea asellus_ to form the eyes of\r\ntheir idols. Fish-hooks are made throughout the Pacific of the shells\r\nof _Avicula_ and _Haliotis_, and are sometimes strengthened by a\r\nbacking made of the columella of _Cypraea arabica_. Small axe-heads are\r\nmade from _Terebra crenulata_ ground down (Woodlark I.), and larger\r\nforms are fashioned from the giant _Tridacna_ (Fiji).\r\n\r\nShells are used to ornament the elaborate cloaks worn by the women of\r\nrank in the Indian tribes of South America. Specimens of _Ampullaria_,\r\n_Orthalicus_, _Labyrinthus_, and _Bulimulus_ depend from the bottom\r\nand back of these garments, while great _Bulimi_, 6 inches long, are\r\nworn as a breast ornament, and at the end of a string of beads and\r\nteeth.[208]\r\n\r\nThe chank-shell (_Turbinella rapa_) is of especial interest from\r\nits connexion with the religion of the Hindoos. The god Vishnu is\r\nrepresented as holding this shell in his hand, and the sinistral form\r\nof it, which is excessively rare, is regarded with extraordinary\r\nveneration. The chank appears as a symbol on the coins of some of the\r\nancient Indian Empires, and is still retained on the coinage of the\r\nRajah of Travancore.\r\n\r\nThe chief fishery of the chank-shell is at Tuticorin, on the Gulf of\r\nManaar, and is conducted during the N. E. monsoon, October-May. In\r\n1885–86 as many as 332,000 specimens were obtained, the net amount\r\nrealised being nearly Rs.24,000. In former days the trade was much\r\nmore lucrative, 4 or 5 millions of specimens being frequently shipped.\r\nThe government of Ceylon used to receive £4000 a year for licenses to\r\nfish, but now the trade is free. The shells are brought up by divers\r\nfrom 2 or 3 fathoms of water. In 1887 a sinistral specimen was found at\r\nJaffna, which sold for Rs.700.[209] Nearly all the shells are sent to\r\nDacca, where they are sliced into bangles and anklets to be worn by the\r\nHindoo women.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important industry which deals only with the shells of\r\nMollusca is that connected with the ‘pearl-oyster.’ The history of the\r\ntrade forms a small literature in itself. It must be sufficient here\r\nto note that the species in question is not an ‘oyster,’ properly so\r\ncalled, but an _Avicula_ (_margaritifera_ Lam.). The ‘mother-of-pearl,’\r\nwhich is extensively employed for the manufacture of buttons, studs,\r\nknife-handles, fans, card-cases, brooches, boxes, and every kind of\r\ninlaid work, is the internal nacreous laminae of the shell of this\r\nspecies. The most important fisheries are those of the Am Islands, the\r\nSoo-loo Archipelago, the Persian Gulf, the Red Sea, Queensland, and the\r\nPearl Islands in the Bay of Panama. The shell also occurs in several\r\nof the groups of the South Pacific--the Paumotu, Gambier and Navigator\r\nIslands, Tahiti being the centre of the trade--and also on the coasts\r\nof Lower California.[210]\r\n\r\nPearls are the result of a disease in the animal of this species of\r\n_Avicula_ and probably in all other species within which they occur.\r\nWhen the _Avicula_ is large, well formed, and with ample space for\r\nindividual development, pearls scarcely occur at all, but when the\r\nshells are crowded together, and become humped and distorted, as\r\nwell as affording cover for all kinds of marine worms and parasitic\r\ncreatures, then pearls are sure to be found. Pearls of inferior value\r\nand size are also produced by _Placuna placenta_, many species of\r\n_Pinna_, the great _Tridacna_, the common _Ostrea edulis_, and several\r\nother marine bivalves. They are not uncommon in _Unio_ and _Anodonta_,\r\nand the common _Margaritana margaritifera_ of our rapid streams is\r\nstill said to be collected, in some parts of Wales, for the purpose of\r\nextracting its small ‘seed-pearls.’ Pink pearls are obtained from the\r\ngiant conch-shell of the West Indies (_Strombus gigas_), as well as\r\nfrom certain _Turbinella_.\r\n\r\nIn Canton, many houses are illuminated almost entirely by skylights and\r\nwindows made of shells, probably the semitransparent valves of _Placuna\r\nplacenta_. In China lime is commonly made of ground cockle-shells,\r\nand, when mixed with oil, forms an excellent putty, used for cementing\r\ncoffins, and in forming a surface for the frescoes with which the\r\ngables of temples and private houses are adorned. Those who suffer from\r\ncutaneous diseases, and convalescents from small-pox, are washed in\r\nCanton with the water in which cockles have been boiled.[211]\r\n\r\nA recent issue of the Peking Gazette contains a report from the\r\noutgoing Viceroy of Fukhien, stating that he had handed over the\r\ninsignia of office to his successor, including _inter alia_ the\r\nconch-shell bestowed by the Throne. A conch-shell with a whorl turning\r\nto the _right_, _i.e._ a sinistral specimen, is supposed when blown to\r\nhave the effect of stilling the waves, and hence is bestowed by the\r\nEmperor upon high officers whose duties oblige them to take voyages by\r\nsea. The Viceroy of Fukhien probably possesses one of these shells in\r\nvirtue of his jurisdiction over Formosa, to which island periodical\r\nvisits are supposed to be made.[212]\r\n\r\nShells appear to be used occasionally by other species besides man.\r\nOyster-catchers at breeding time prepare a number of imitation nests\r\nin the gravel on the spit of land where they build, putting bits of\r\nwhite shell in them to represent eggs.[213] This looks like a trick\r\nin order to conceal the position of the true nest. According to\r\nNordenskjöld, when the eider duck of Spitzbergen has only one or two\r\neggs in its nest, it places a shell of _Buccinum glaciale_ beside\r\nthem. The appropriation of old shells by hermit-crabs is a familiar\r\nsight all over the world. Perhaps it is most striking in the tropics,\r\nwhere it is really startling, at first experience, to meet--as I have\r\ndone--a large _Cassis_ or _Turbo_, walking about in a wood or on a hill\r\nside at considerable distances from the sea. A Gephyrean (_Phascolion\r\nstrombi_) habitually establishes itself in the discarded shells of\r\nmarine Mollusca. Certain Hymenoptera make use of dead shells of _Helix\r\nhortensis_ in which they build their cells.[214] Magnus believes that\r\nin times when heavy rains prevail, and the usual insects do not venture\r\nout, certain flowers are fertilised by snails and slugs crawling over\r\nthem, _e.g._ _Leucanthemum vulgare_ by _Limax laevis_.[215]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mollusca as Food for Man.=--Probably there are few countries in the\r\nworld in which less use is made of the Mollusca as a form of food than\r\nin our own. There are scarcely ten native species which can be said to\r\nbe at all commonly employed for this purpose. Neighbouring countries\r\nshow us an example in this respect. The French, Italians, and Spanish\r\neat _Natica_, _Turbo_, _Triton_, and _Murex_, and, among bivalves,\r\n_Donax_, _Venus_, _Lithodomus_, _Pholas_, _Tapes_, and _Cardita_,\r\nas well as the smaller Cephalopoda. Under the general designation\r\nof _clam_ the Americans eat _Venus mercenaria_, _Mya arenaria_,\r\nand _Mactra solidissima_. In the Suez markets are exposed for sale\r\n_Strombus_ and _Melongena_, _Avicula_ and _Cytherea_. At Panama _Donax_\r\nand _Solen_ are delicacies, while the natives also eat the great\r\n_Murex_ and _Pyrula_, and even the huge _Arca grandis_, which lives\r\nembedded in the liquid river mud.\r\n\r\nThe common littoral bivalves seem to be eaten in nearly all countries\r\nexcept our own, and it is therefore needless to enumerate them. The\r\nGasteropoda, whose habits are scarcely so cleanly, seem to require a\r\nbolder spirit and less delicate palate to venture on their consumption.\r\n\r\nThe Malays of the East Indian islands eat _Telescopium fuscum_ and\r\n_Pyrazus palustris_, which abound in the mangrove swamps. They throw\r\nthem on their wood fires, and when they are sufficiently cooked, break\r\noff the top of the spire and suck the animal out through the opening.\r\n_Haliotis_ they take out of the shell, string together, and dry in the\r\nsun. The lower classes in the Philippines eat _Arca inaequivalvis_,\r\nboiling them as we do mussels.[216] In the Corean islands a species\r\nof _Monodonta_ and another of _Mytilus_ are quite peppery, and bite\r\nthe tongue; our own _Helix revelata_, as I can vouch from personal\r\nexperience, has a similar flavour. _Fusus colosseus_, _Rapana bezoar_,\r\nand _Purpura luteostoma_ are eaten on the southern coasts of China;\r\n_Strombus luhuanus_, _Turbo chrysostomus_, _Trochus niloticus_, and\r\n_Patella testudinaria_, by the natives of New Caledonia; _Strombus\r\ngigas_ and _Livona pica_ in the West Indies; _Turbo niger_ and\r\n_Concholepas peruvianus_ on the Chilian coasts; four species of\r\n_Strombus_ and _Nerita_, one each of _Purpura_ and _Turbo_, besides two\r\n_Tridacna_ and one _Hippopus_, by the natives of British New Guinea.\r\nWest Indian negroes eat the large Chitons which are abundant on their\r\nrocky coasts, cutting off and swallowing raw the fleshy foot, which\r\nthey call ‘beef,’ and rejecting the viscera. Dried cephalopods are a\r\nfavourite Chinese dish, and are regularly exported to San Francisco,\r\nwhere the Chinamen make them into soup. The ‘Challenger’ obtained two\r\nspecies of _Sepia_ and two of _Loligo_ from the market at Yokohama.\r\n\r\nThe insipidity of fresh-water Mollusca renders them much less desirable\r\nas a form of food. Some species of Unionidae, however, are said to\r\nbe eaten in France. _Anodonta edulis_ is specially cultivated for\r\nfood in certain districts of China, and the African _Aetheriae_ are\r\neaten by negroes. _Navicella_ and _Neritina_ are eaten in Mauritius,\r\n_Ampullaria_ and _Neritina_ in Guadeloupe, and _Paludina_ in Cambodia.\r\n\r\nThe vast heaps of empty shells known as ‘kitchen-middens,’ occur in\r\nalmost every part of the world. They are found in Scotland, Denmark,\r\nthe east and west coasts of North America, Brazil, Tierra del Fuego,\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, and are sometimes several hundred yards\r\nin length. They are invariably composed of the edible shells of the\r\nadjacent coast, mixed with bones of Mammals, birds, and fish. From\r\ntheir great size, it is believed that many of them must have taken\r\ncenturies to form.\r\n\r\nPre-eminent among existing shell-fish industries stands the cultivation\r\nof the oyster and the mussel, a more detailed account of which may\r\nprove interesting.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the oyster[217] as a luxury of food dates at least\r\nfrom the gastronomic age of Rome. Every one has heard of the epicure\r\nwhose taste was so educated that\r\n\r\n                                    “he could tell\r\n    At the first mouthful, if his oysters fed\r\n    On the Rutupian or the Lucrine bed\r\n    Or at Circeii.”[218]\r\n\r\nThe first artificial oyster-cultivator on a large scale appears to have\r\nbeen a certain Roman named Sergius Orata, who lived about a century\r\nB.C. His object, according to Pliny the elder,[219] was not\r\nto please his own appetite so much as to make money by ministering\r\nto the appetites of others. His _vivaria_ were situated on the\r\nLucrine Lake, near Baiae, and the Lucrine oysters obtained under his\r\ncultivation a notoriety which they never entirely lost, although\r\nBritish oysters eventually came to be more highly esteemed. He must\r\nhave been a great enthusiast in his trade, for on one occasion when he\r\nbecame involved in a law-suit with one of the riparian proprietors,\r\nhis counsel declared that Orata’s opponent made a great mistake if he\r\nexpected to damp his ardour by expelling him from the lake, for, sooner\r\nthan not grow oysters at all, he would grow them upon the roof of his\r\nhouse.[220] Orata’s successors in the business seem to have understood\r\nthe secret of planting young oysters in new beds, for we are told that\r\nspecimens brought from Brundisium and even from Britain were placed for\r\na while in the Lucrine Lake, to fatten after their long journey, and\r\nalso to acquire the esteemed “Lucrine flavour.”\r\n\r\nOysters are ‘in season’ whenever there is an ‘r’ in the month, in other\r\nwords, from September to April. ‘Mensibus erratis,’ as the poet has\r\nit, ‘vos ostrea manducatis!’ It has been computed that the quantity\r\nannually produced in Great Britain amounts to no less than sixteen\r\nhundred million, while in America the number is estimated at five\r\nthousand five hundred million, the value being over thirteen million\r\ndollars, and the number of persons employed fifty thousand. Arcachon,\r\none of the principal French oyster-parks, has nearly 10,000 acres of\r\noyster beds, the annual value being from eight to ten million francs;\r\nin 1884–85, 178,359,000 oysters were exported from this place alone. In\r\nthe season 1889–90, 50,000 tons of oysters were consumed in London.\r\n\r\nFew will now be found to echo the poet Gay’s opinion:\r\n\r\n    “That man had sure a palate covered o’er\r\n    With brass or steel, that on the rocky shore\r\n    First broke the oozy oyster’s pearly coat,\r\n    And risq’d the living morsel down his throat.”\r\n\r\nThere were halcyon days in England once, when oysters were to be\r\nprocured at 8d. the bushel. Now it costs exactly that amount before\r\na bushel, brought up the Thames, can even be exposed for sale at\r\nBillingsgate (4d. porterage, 4d. market toll), and prime Whitstable\r\nnatives average from 3½d. to 4d. each. The principal causes of this\r\nrise in prices, apart from the increased demand, are (1) over-dredging;\r\n(2) ignorant cultivation, and to these may be added (3) the effect of\r\nbad seasons in destroying young oysters, or preventing the spat from\r\nmaturing. Our own principal beds are those at Whitstable, Rochester,\r\nColchester, Milton (famous for its ‘melting’ natives), Faversham,\r\nQueenborough, Burnham, Poole, and Carlingford in Co. Down, and\r\nNewhaven, near Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nThe oyster-farms at Whitstable, public and private, extend over an\r\narea of more than 27 square miles. The principal of these is a kind of\r\njoint-stock company, with no other privilege of entrance except birth\r\nas a free dredgeman of the town. When a holder dies, his interest dies\r\nwith him. Twelve directors, known as “the Jury,” manage the affairs of\r\nthe company, which finds employment for several thousand people, and\r\nsometimes turns over as much as £200,000 a year. The term ‘Natives,’\r\nas applied to these Whitstable or to other English oysters, requires a\r\nword of explanation. A ‘Native’ oyster is simply an oyster which has\r\nbeen bred on or near the Thames estuary, but very probably it may be\r\ndeveloped from a brood which came from Scotland or some other place at\r\na distance. For some unexplained reason, oysters bred on the London\r\nclay acquire a greater delicacy of flavour than elsewhere. The company\r\npay large sums for brood to stock their own grounds, since there can be\r\nno certainty that the spat from their own oysters will fall favourably,\r\nor even within their own domains at all. Besides purchases from other\r\nbeds, the parks are largely stocked with small oysters picked up along\r\nthe coast or dredged from grounds public to all, sometimes as much\r\nas 50s. a bushel being paid for the best brood. It is probably this\r\nsystem of transplanting, combined with systematic working of the beds,\r\nwhich has made the Whitstable oyster so excellent both as to quality\r\nand quantity of flesh. The whole surface of the ‘layings’ is explored\r\nevery year by the dredge, successive portions of the ground being\r\ngone over in regular rotation, and every provision being made for the\r\nwell-being of the crop, and the destruction of their enemies. For three\r\ndays of every week the men dredge for ‘planting,’ _i.e._ for the\r\ntransference of suitable specimens from one place to another, the\r\nseparation of adhering shells, the removal of odd valves and of every\r\nkind of refuse, and the killing off of dangerous foes. On the other\r\nthree days they dredge for the market, taking care only to lift such a\r\nnumber as will match the demand.\r\n\r\nThe Colne beds are natural beds, as opposed to the majority of the\r\ngreat working beds, which are artificial. They are the property of\r\nthe town of Colchester, which appoints a water-bailiff to manage the\r\nconcern. Under his direction is a jury of twelve, who regulate the\r\ntimes of dredging, the price at which sales are to be made, and are\r\ngenerally responsible for the practical working of the trade. Here, and\r\nat Faversham, Queenborough, Rochester, and other places, ‘natives’ are\r\ngrown which rival those of Whitstable.\r\n\r\nThere can be no question, however, that the cultivation of oysters by\r\nthe French is far more complete and efficient than our own, and has\r\nreached a higher degree of scientific perfection combined with economy\r\nand solid profits. And yet, between 40 and 50 years ago, the French\r\nbeds were utterly exhausted and unproductive, and showed every sign\r\nof failure and decay. It was in 1858 that the celebrated beds on the\r\nIle de Ré, near Rochelle, were first started. Their originator was\r\na certain shrewd stone-mason, by name Boeuf. He determined to try,\r\nentirely on his own account, whether oysters could not be made to grow\r\non the long muddy fore-shore which is left by the ebb of the tide.\r\nAccordingly, he constructed with his own hands a small basin enclosed\r\nby a low wall, and placed at the bottom a number of stones picked out\r\nof the surrounding mud, stocking his ‘parc’ with a few bushels of\r\nhealthy young brood. The experiment was entirely successful, in spite\r\nof the jeers of his neighbours, and Boeuf’s profits, which soon began\r\nto mount up at an astonishing rate, induced others to start similar\r\nor more extensive farms for themselves. The movement spread rapidly,\r\nand in a few years a stretch of miles of unproductive mud banks was\r\nconverted into the seat of a most prosperous industry. The general\r\ninterests of the trade appear to be regulated in a similar manner to\r\nthat at Whitstable; delegates are appointed by the various communities\r\nto watch over the business as a whole, while questions affecting the\r\nwell-being of oyster-culture are discussed in a sort of representative\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nAt the same time as Boeuf was planting his first oysters on the shores\r\nof the Ile de Ré, M. Coste had been reporting to the French government\r\nin favour of such a system of ostreiculture as was then practised\r\nby the Italians in the old classic Lakes Avernus and Lucrinus. The\r\nprinciple there adopted was to prevent, as far as possible, the escape\r\nof the spat from the ground at the time when it is first emitted by\r\nthe breeding oyster. Stakes and fascines of wood were placed in such\r\na position as to catch the spat and give it a chance of obtaining a\r\nhold before it perished or was carried away into the open sea. The old\r\noyster beds in the Bay of St. Brieuc were renewed on this principle,\r\nbanks being constructed and overlaid with bundles of wood to prevent\r\nthe escape of the new spat. The attempt was entirely successful, and\r\nled to the establishment or re-establishment of those numerous parcs,\r\nwith which the French coast is studded from Brest to the Gironde. The\r\nprincipal centres of the industry are Arcachon, Auray, Cancale, and la\r\nTeste.\r\n\r\nIt is at Marennes, in Normandy, that the production of the celebrated\r\n‘green oyster’ is carried out, that especial luxury of the French\r\nepicure. Green oysters are a peculiarly French taste, and, though they\r\nsometimes occur on the Essex marshes, there is no market for them in\r\nEngland. The preference for them, on the continent, may be traced back\r\nas early as 1713, when we find a record of their having been served\r\nup at a supper given by an ambassador at the Hague. Green oysters are\r\nnot always green, it is only after they are placed in the ‘claires,’\r\nor fattening ponds, that they acquire the hue; they never occur in\r\nthe open sea. The green colour does not extend over the whole animal,\r\nbut is found only in the branchiae and labial tentacles, which are\r\nof a deep blue-green. Various theories have been started to explain\r\nthe ‘greening’ of the mollusc; the presence of copper in the tanks,\r\nthe chlorophyll of marine algae, an overgrowth of some parasite, a\r\ndisease akin to liver complaint, have all found their advocates. Prof.\r\nLankester seems to have established[221] the fact,--which indeed had\r\nbeen observed 70 years before by a M. Gaillon,--that the greening is\r\ndue to the growth of a certain diatom (_Navicula ostrearia_) in the\r\nwater of the tanks. This diatom, which is of a deep blue-green colour,\r\nappears from April to June, and in September. The oyster swallows\r\nquantities of the _Navicula_; the pigment enters the blood in a\r\ncondition of chemical modification, which makes it colourless in all\r\nthe other parts of the body, but when the blood reaches the gills the\r\naction of the secretion cells causes the blue tint to be restored. The\r\nfact that the colour is rather green than blue in the gills, which are\r\nyellowish brown, is due to certain optical conditions.\r\n\r\nNot till the young white oyster has been steeped for several years in\r\nthe muddy waters of the ‘claires’ does it acquire the proper tint to\r\nqualify it for the Parisian restaurant. The ‘claires’ are each about\r\n100 feet square, surrounded by low broad banks of earth, about 3 feet\r\nhigh and 6 feet thick at the base. Before the oysters are laid down,\r\nthe gates which admit the tide are carefully opened and shut a great\r\nmany times, in order to collect a sufficient amount of the _Navicula_.\r\nWhen this is done, the beds are formed, and are not again overflowed\r\nby the sea, except at very high tides. The oysters are shifted from\r\none ‘claire’ to another, in order to perfect the ‘greening’ process.\r\nAbout fifty million of these ‘huitres de Marennes’ are produced\r\nannually, yielding a revenue of 2,500,000 francs.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from the experience of one of the most enthusiastic of\r\nFrench oyster-growers (Dr. Kemmerer), that oysters _grow_ best in\r\nmuddy water, and _breed_ best in clear water. Thus the open sea is\r\nthe place where the spat should fall and be secured, and, as soon as\r\nit is of a suitable size, it should be transferred to the closed tank\r\nor reservoir, where it will find the quiet and the food (confervae,\r\ninfusoria, minute algae) which are so requisite for its proper growth.\r\nIn muddy ground the animal and phosphorous matter increases, and the\r\nflesh becomes fatter and more oily. A sudden change from the clear\r\nsea-water to the muddy tank is inadvisable, and thus a series of\r\nshiftings through tanks with water of graduated degrees of nourishment\r\nis the secret of proper oyster cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe American oyster trade is larger even than the French. The Baltimore\r\noyster beds in the Chesapeake River and its tributaries cover 3000\r\nacres, and produce an annual crop of 25 million bushels, as many as\r\n100,000 bushels being sometimes taken from Chesapeake Bay in a single\r\nday. Baltimore is the centre of the tinned oyster trade, while that\r\nin raw oysters centres in New York. Most of the beds whose produce is\r\ncarried to New York are situated in New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware,\r\nor Virginia. The laws of these states do not allow the beds to be owned\r\nby any but resident owners, and the New York dealers have consequently\r\nto form fictitious partnerships with residents near the various oyster\r\nbeds, supply them with money to buy the beds and plant the oysters,\r\nand then give them a share in the profits. It has been estimated that\r\nfrom the Virginia beds 4,000,000 bushels of oysters are carried every\r\nyear to Fair Haven in New England, 4,000,000 to New York, 3,000,000 to\r\nProvidence, and 2,000,000 each to Boston, Philadelphia, and Baltimore.\r\nThe American ‘native’ (_O. virginica_) is a distinct species from our\r\nown, being much larger and longer in proportion to its breadth; it is\r\nsaid to be also much more prolific.\r\n\r\nAccording to Milne-Edwards,[222] in the great oyster parks on the\r\ncoasts of Calvados, the oysters are educated to keep their shells\r\nclosed when out of water, and so retain water enough inside to keep\r\ntheir gills moist, and arrive at their destination in good condition.\r\nAs soon as an oyster is taken out of the sea, it closes its shells,\r\nand keeps them closed until the shock of removal has passed away, or\r\nperhaps until the desirability of a fresh supply of water suggests\r\nitself. The men take advantage of this to exercise the oysters,\r\nremoving them from the sea for longer and longer periods. In time this\r\nhas the desired effect; the well-educated mollusc learns that it is\r\nhopeless to ‘open’ when out of the water, and so keeps his shell closed\r\nand his gills moist, and his general economy in good condition.\r\n\r\nOysters have been known to live entirely out of water for a\r\nconsiderable time. Prof. Verrill once noticed[223] a large cluster\r\nof oysters attached to an old boot, hanging outside a fish-shop\r\nin Washington. They had been taken out of the water on about 10th\r\nDecember, and on 25th February following some of the largest were still\r\nalive. It was noticed that all those which survived had the hinge\r\nupward and the ventral edge downward, this being the most favourable\r\nposition possible for the retention of water within the gill-cavity,\r\nsince the edge of the mantle would pack against the margins of the\r\nshell, and prevent the water from leaking away.\r\n\r\nSuch a succulent creature as the oyster has naturally many enemies.\r\nOne of the worst of these is the ravenous Starfish, or Five-finger.\r\nHis omnivorous capacities are well described by a clever writer and\r\nshrewd observer of nature: “Here is one doubled up like a sea-urchin,\r\nbrilliant of hue, and when spread out quite 16 inches in diameter;\r\nwhere, and oh where, can you obtain a prey? The hoe we carry is thrust\r\nout and the mass dragged shorewards, when the rascal disgorges two\r\nlarge dog-whelks he has been in the process of devouring. We feel\r\na comfortable glow of satisfaction to think that this enemy of our\r\noyster-beds is also the enemy of our other enemy, this carnivorous\r\nborer. Here, quite close alongside, is another, only inferior in size,\r\nand we drag him ashore likewise, to find that the fellow has actually\r\nhad the courage and audacity to suck the contents out of a large\r\nhorse-mussel (_Modiola_), the strong muscle alone remaining undevoured.\r\nWe proceed along but a short way when we meet with still another in\r\nthe curled-up condition in which they gorge themselves, and as we drag\r\nit shorewards the shell of a _Tapes pullastra_ drops from the relaxing\r\ngrasp of the ogre. Slowly the extended stomach returns to its place,\r\nand the monster settles back to an uncomfortable after-dinner siesta\r\non an exposed boulder; for the starfish wraps its turned-out stomach\r\naround the prey it has secured, in place of attempting to devour the\r\nlimey covering in which most of its game is protected. Once the mouth\r\nof the shell is enclosed in the stomach of the starfish, the creature\r\nsoon sickens, the hinge-spring relaxes its hold, and the shell opening\r\npermits the starfish to suck out the gelatinous contents, and cast free\r\nthe calcareous skeleton.”[224]\r\n\r\nAccording to other observers the starfish seizes the oyster with two\r\nof his fingers, while with the other three he files away the edge of\r\nthe flat or upper valve until the points of contact with the round\r\nvalve are reduced almost to nothing; then he can introduce an arm, and\r\nthe rest is easy work. Others suggest that the starfish suffocates the\r\noyster by applying two of its fingers so closely to the edge of the\r\nvalves that the oyster is unable to open them; after a while the vital\r\npowers relax and the shell gapes. The Rev. J. G. Wood holds[225] that\r\nthe starfish pours a secretion from its mouth which “paralyses the\r\nhinge muscle and causes the shell to open.” Sometimes in a single night\r\na whole bed of oysters will be totally destroyed by an invasion of\r\nstarfish. Another dreaded enemy is the ‘whelk,’ a term which includes\r\n_Purpura lapillus_, _Murex erinaceus_, _Buccinum undatum_, and probably\r\nalso _Nassa reticulata_. All these species perforate the shell with the\r\nend of their radula, and then suck out the contents through the neatly\r\ndrilled hole. Skate fish are the cause of terrible destruction in the\r\nopen beds, and a scarcely less dangerous visitant is the octopus. Crabs\r\ncrush the young shells with their claws, and are said to gather in\r\nbands and scratch sand or mud over the larger specimens, which makes\r\nthem open their shells. Yet another, and perhaps unconscious, foe is\r\nfound in the common mussel, which takes up room meant for the young\r\noysters, grows over the larger individuals, and harbours all sorts\r\nof refuse between and under its closely packed ranks. _Cliona_, a\r\nparasitic sponge, bores in between the layers of the oyster’s shell,\r\npitting them with tiny holes (corresponding to its _oscula_), and\r\ndisturbing the inmate, who has constantly to construct new layers of\r\nshell from the inside. Weed, annelids, ‘blubber,’ shifting sand or\r\nmud, sewage or any poisoning of the water, are seriously harmful to\r\nthe oyster’s best interests. A very severe winter is often the cause\r\nof wholesale destruction in the beds. According to the _Daily News_ of\r\n26th March 1891, the Whitstable oyster companies lost property to the\r\nvalue of £30,000 in the exceptionally cold winter of 1890–91, when, on\r\nthe coast of Kent, the surface temperature of the sea sank below 32°,\r\nand the advancing tide pushed a small ice-floe before it. Two million\r\noysters were laid down in one week of the following spring, to make up\r\nfor the loss. During the severe winter of 1892–93 extraordinary efforts\r\nwere made at Hayling I. to protect the oysters from the frost. Twenty\r\nmillion oysters were placed in ponds for the winter, and a steam-engine\r\nwas for days employed to keep the ponds thawed and supplied with water,\r\nwhile large coal and coke fires were kept burning at the edge of the\r\nponds.[226] On the other hand, the unusually warm and sunny summer\r\nof 1893 is said to have resulted in the finest fall of spat known in\r\nWhitstable for fifty years.[227]\r\n\r\nThe _reproductive activity_ of the oyster is supposed to commence about\r\nthe third year. Careful research has shown[228] that the sexes in the\r\nEnglish oyster are not separate, but that each individual is male as\r\nwell as female, producing spermatozoa as well as ova in the same gland.\r\nHere, however, two divergent views appear. Some authorities hold that\r\nthe oyster does not fecundate its own eggs, but that this operation is\r\nperformed by spermatozoa emitted by other specimens. It is believed\r\nthat, in each individual, the spermatozoa arrive at maturity first, and\r\nthat the ova are not produced until after the spermatozoa have been\r\nemitted; thus the oyster is first male and then female, morphologically\r\nhermaphrodite, but physiologically unisexual. Others are of opinion\r\nthat the oyster does fecundate its own eggs, ova being first produced,\r\nand passed into the infrabranchial chamber--the ‘white-sick’ stage--and\r\nthen, after an interval, spermatozoa being formed and fecundating\r\nthese ova--the ‘black-sick’ stage. In this latter view the oyster\r\nis first female and then male, and is, both morphologically and\r\nphysiologically, hermaphrodite. The old view, that ‘black-sick’ oysters\r\nare the male, and ‘white-sick’ the female, is therefore quite incorrect.\r\n\r\nThe ova, in their earliest stage, consist of minute oval clusters of\r\nglobules floating in a transparent mucus. They pass from the ovary\r\ninto the gills and folds of the mantle, and are probably fecundated\r\nwithin the excretory ducts of the ovary, before arriving in the mantle\r\nchamber. In this stage the oyster is termed ‘white-sick.’ In about a\r\nfortnight, as the course of development proceeds, the fertilised ova\r\nbecome ciliated at one end (the so-called _veliger_ stage, p. 131),\r\nand soon pigment appears in various parts of the embryos, giving them\r\na darker colour, which varies from grayish to blue, and thus the\r\nwhite-sick oyster becomes ‘black-sick.’ When the black spat emerge,\r\nthey are still furnished with cilia for their free-swimming life. This\r\nis of very short duration, for unless the embryo finds some suitable\r\nground on which to affix itself within forty-eight hours, it perishes.\r\nAs the spat escapes from the parent oyster, which slightly opens its\r\nvalves and blows the spat out in jets, it resembles a thick cloud in\r\nthe water, and is carried about at the mercy of wind and tide. April to\r\nAugust are the usual spawning months, warm weather being apparently an\r\nabsolute necessity to secure the adhering of the spat. A temperature\r\nof 65° to 72° F. seems requisite for their proper deposit. Thus on a\r\nfine, warm day, with little wind or tide running, the spat will fall\r\nnear the parents and be safely secured, while in cold, blustering\r\nweather it will certainly be carried off to a distance, and probably\r\nbe altogether lost. The number of young produced by each individual\r\nhas been variously estimated at from 300,000 to 60,000,000. Either\r\nextreme seems enormous, but it must be remembered that besides climatal\r\ndangers, hosts of enemies--other Mollusca, fish, and Crustacea--beset\r\nthe opening career of the young oyster.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the spat has safely ‘fallen,’ it adheres to some solid\r\nobject, and loses the cilia which were necessary for its swimming life.\r\nIt begins to grow rapidly, increasing from about 1/20 inch in diameter\r\nto about the size of a threepenny piece in five or six months, and in\r\na year to one inch in diameter. Roughly speaking, the best guide to an\r\noyster’s age is its size; it is as many years old as it measures inches\r\nacross.\r\n\r\nThe oyster is at its prime at the age of five; its natural life is\r\nsupposed to be about ten years. The rings, or ‘shoots’ on a shell are\r\nnot--as is frequently supposed--marks of annual growth; cases have been\r\nnoticed where as many as three ‘shoots’ were made during the year.\r\n\r\nAn oyster is furnished, on the protruding edges of the mantle, with\r\npigmented spots which may be termed ‘visual organs,’ though they hardly\r\nrise to the capacities and organisation of real ‘eyes.’ But there is no\r\ndoubt that they are sufficiently sensitive to the action of light to\r\nenable the oyster to apprehend the approach of danger, and close his\r\ndoors accordingly. ‘How sensitive,’ notes Mr. W. Anderson Smith,[229]\r\n‘the creatures are to the light above them; the shadow of the iron as\r\nit passes overhead is instantaneously noted, and snap! the lips are\r\nfirmly closed.’\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of _Ostrea edulis_ extends from Tränen,\r\nin Norway, close to the Arctic circle, to Gibraltar and certain parts\r\nof the Mediterranean, Holland, and N. Germany to Heligoland, and the\r\nwestern shores of Sleswick and Jutland. It occurs in Iceland, but does\r\nnot enter the Baltic, where attempts to colonise it have always failed.\r\nSome authorities regard the Mediterranean form as a distinct species.\r\n\r\nThe literature of oyster-cookery may be passed over in silence. The\r\ncurious may care to refer to M. S. Lovell’s _Edible British Mollusks_,\r\nwhere no less than thirty-nine different ways of dressing oysters\r\nare enumerated. It may, however, be worth while to add a word on\r\nthe subject of _poisonous_ oysters. Cases have been known where a\r\nparticular batch of oysters has, for some reason, been fatal to those\r\nwho have partaken of them. It is possible that this may have been due,\r\nin certain instances, to the presence of a superabundance of copper\r\nin the oysters, and there is no doubt that the symptoms detailed have\r\noften closely resembled those of copper poisoning. Cases of poisoning\r\nhave occurred at Rochefort through’ the importation of ‘green oysters’\r\nfrom Falmouth. It would no doubt be dangerous ever to eat oysters\r\nwhich had grown on the copper bottom of a ship. But copper is present,\r\nin more or less minute quantities, in very many Mollusca, and it\r\nis more probable that a certain form of slow decomposition in some\r\nshell-fish develops an alkaloid poison which is more harmful to some\r\npeople than to others, just as some people can never digest any kind\r\nof shell-fish.[230] These alkaloid developments from putrescence are\r\ncalled ptomaines. In confirmation of this view, reference may be\r\nmade to a case, taken from an Indian Scientific Journal, in which an\r\nofficer, his wife, and household ate safely of a basket of oysters for\r\nthree days at almost every meal. The basket then passed out of their\r\nhands, not yet exhausted of its contents, and a man who had already\r\neaten of these oysters at the officer’s table was afterwards poisoned\r\nby some from the same basketful.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of the common mussel (_Mytilus edulis_ L.) is not\r\npractised in this country, although it is used as food in the natural\r\nstate of growth all round our coasts. The French appear to be the only\r\nnation who go in for extensive mussel farming. The principal of these\r\nestablishments is at a little town called Esnaudes, not far from La\r\nRochelle, and within sight of the Ile de Ré and its celebrated oyster\r\nparks. The secret of the cultivation consists in the employment of\r\n‘bouchots,’ or tall hurdles, which are planted in the mud of the\r\nfore-shore, and upon which the mussel (_la moule_, as the French call\r\nit) grows. The method is said[231] to have been invented as long ago as\r\n1235 by a shipwrecked Irishman named Walton. He used to hang a purse\r\nnet to stakes, in the hope of capturing sea birds. He found, however,\r\nthat the mussels which attached themselves to his stakes were a much\r\nmore easily attainable source of food, and he accordingly multiplied\r\nhis stakes, out of which the present ‘_bouchot_’ system has developed.\r\nThe shore is simply a stretch of liquid mud, and the bouchots are\r\narranged in shape like a single or double V, with the opening looking\r\ntowards the sea. The fishermen, in visiting the bouchots, glide about\r\nover the mud in _piroques_ or light, flat-bottomed boats, propelling\r\nthem by shoving the mud with their feet. Each bouchot is now about 450\r\nyards long, standing 6 feet out of the mud, making a strong wall of\r\nsolid basket-work, and as there are altogether at least 500 bouchots,\r\nthe total mussel-bearing length of wall is nearly 130 miles.\r\n\r\nThe mussel-spat affixes itself naturally to the bouchots nearest the\r\nsea, in January and February. Towards May the planting begins. The\r\nyoung mussels are scraped off these outermost bouchots, and placed\r\nin small bags made of old canvas or netting, each bag holding a good\r\nhandful of the mussels. The bags are then fastened to some of the inner\r\nbouchots, and the mussels soon attach themselves by their byssus, the\r\nbag rotting and falling away. They hang in clusters, increasing rapidly\r\nin size, and at the proper time are transplanted to bouchots farther\r\nand farther up the tide level, the object being to bring the matured\r\nanimal as near as possible to the land when it is time for it to be\r\ngathered. This process, which aims at keeping the mussel out of the\r\nmud, while at the same time giving it all the nutrition that comes\r\nfrom such a habitat, extends over about a year in the case of each\r\nindividual. Quality, rather than quantity, is the aim of the Esnaudes\r\nboucholiers. The element of quantity, however, seems to come in when\r\nwe are told that each yard of the bouchots is calculated to yield a\r\ncartload of mussels, value 6 francs, and that the whole annual revenue\r\nis at least £52,000.\r\n\r\nIn this country, and especially in Scotland, mussels are largely used\r\nas bait for long-line fishing. Of late years other substances have\r\nrather tended to take the place of mussels, but within the last twenty\r\nyears, at Newhaven on the Firth of Forth, three and a half million\r\nmussels were required annually to supply bait for four deep-sea craft\r\nand sixteen smaller vessels. According to Ad. Meyer,[232] boughs of\r\ntrees are laid down in Kiel Bay, and taken up again, after three, four,\r\nor five years, between December and March, when they are found covered\r\nwith fine mussels. The boughs are then sold, just as they are, by\r\nweight, and the shell-fish sent into the interior of Germany.\r\n\r\nMussels are very sensitive to cold weather. In 1874, during an\r\neasterly gale, 195 acres of mussels at Boston, in Lincolnshire, were\r\nkilled in a single night. They soon affix themselves to the bottom\r\nof vessels that have lain for any length of time in harbour or near\r\nthe coast. The bottom of the _Great Eastern_ steamship was at one\r\ntime so thickly coated with mussels that it was estimated that a\r\nvessel of 200 tons could have been laden from her. In some of our\r\nlow-lying coast districts mussels are a valuable protection against\r\ninundation. “An action for trespass was brought some time ago for the\r\npurpose of establishing the right of the lord of the manor to prevent\r\nthe inhabitants of Heacham from taking mussels from the sea-shore.\r\nThe locality is the fore-shore of the sea, running from Lynn in a\r\nnorth-westerly direction towards Hunstanton in Norfolk; and the\r\nnature of the shore is such that it requires constant attention, and\r\nno little expenditure of money, to maintain its integrity, and guard\r\nagainst the serious danger of inundations of the sea. Beds of mussels\r\nextend for miles along the shore, attaching themselves to artificial\r\njetties running into the sea, thereby rendering them firm, and thus\r\nacting as barriers against the sea [and as traps to catch the silt,\r\nand thus constantly raise the level of the shore]. Therefore, while it\r\nis important for the inhabitants, who claim a right by custom, to take\r\nmussels and other shell-fish from the shore, it is equally important\r\nfor the lord of the manor to do his utmost to prevent these natural\r\nfriends of his embankments and jetties from being removed in large\r\nquantities.”[233]\r\n\r\nThe fable that Bideford Bridge is held together by the byssi of\r\n_Mytilus_, which prevent the fabric from being carried away by the\r\ntide, has so often been repeated that it is perhaps worth while to give\r\nthe exact state of the case, as ascertained from a Town Councillor.\r\nThe mussels are supposed to be of some advantage to the bridge,\r\nconsequently there is a by-law forbidding their removal, but the\r\ncorporation have not, and never had, any boat or men employed in any\r\nway with regard to them.\r\n\r\nPoisoning by mussels is much more frequent than by oysters. At\r\nWilhelmshaven,[234] in Germany, in 1885, large numbers of persons were\r\npoisoned, and some died, from eating mussels taken from the harbour.\r\nIt was found that when transferred to open water these mussels became\r\ninnocuous, while, on the other hand, mussels from outside, placed in\r\nthe harbour, became poisonous. The cause obviously lay in the stagnant\r\nand corrupted waters of the harbour, which were rarely freshened by\r\ntides. It was proved to demonstration that the poison was not due to\r\ndecomposition; the liver of the mussels was the poisonous part. In the\r\npersons affected, the symptoms were of three kinds, exanthematous\r\n(skin eruptions), choleraic, and paralytic. Cases of similar poisoning\r\nare not unfrequent in our own country, and the circumstances tend to\r\nshow that, besides the danger from mussels bred in stagnant water,\r\nthere is also risk in eating them when ‘out of season’ in the spawning\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n_Whelks_ are very largely employed for bait, especially in the cod\r\nfishery. The whelk fishery in Whitstable Bay, both for bait and for\r\nhuman food, yields £12,000 a year. Dr. Johnston, of Berwick, estimated\r\nthat about 12 million limpets were annually consumed for bait in that\r\ndistrict alone. The cockle fishery in Carmarthen Bay employs from 500\r\nto 600 families, and is worth £15,000 a year, that in Morecambe Bay is\r\nworth £20,000.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation of Snails for Food; Use as Medicine.=--It was a certain\r\nFulvius Hirpinus who, according to Pliny the elder,[235] first\r\ninstituted snail preserves at Tarquinium, about 50 B.C. He appears to\r\nhave bred several species in his ‘cochlearia,’ keeping them separate\r\nfrom one another. In one division were the _albulae_, which came from\r\nReate; in another the ‘very big snails’ (probably _H. lucorum_), from\r\nIllyria; in a third the African snails, whose characteristic was their\r\nfecundity; in a fourth those from Soletum, noted for their ‘nobility.’\r\nTo increase the size of his snails, Hirpinus fed them on a fattening\r\nmixture of meal and new wine, and, says the author in a burst of\r\nenthusiasm, ‘the glory of this art was carried to such an extent that\r\na single snail-shell was capable of holding eighty sixpenny pieces.’\r\nVarro[236] recommends that the snaileries be surrounded by a ditch, to\r\nsave the expense of a special slave to catch the runaways. Snails were\r\nnot regarded by the Romans as a particular luxury. Pliny the younger\r\nreproaches[237] his friend Septicius Clarus for breaking a dinner\r\nengagement with him, at which the _menu_ was to have been a lettuce,\r\nthree snails and two eggs apiece, barley water, mead and snow, olives,\r\nbeetroot, gourds and truffles, and going off somewhere else where he\r\ngot oysters, scallops, and sea-urchins. In Horace’s time they were used\r\nas a gentle stimulant to the appetite, for\r\n\r\n    “’Tis best with roasted shrimps and Afric snails\r\n    To rouse your drinker when his vigour fails.”[238]\r\n\r\nEscargotières, or snail-gardens, still exist in many parts of Europe,\r\n_e.g._ at Dijon, at Troyes and many other places in central and\r\nsouthern France, at Brunswick, Copenhagen, and Ulm. The markets at\r\nParis, Marseilles, Bordeaux, Toulouse, Nantes, etc., are chiefly\r\nsupplied by snails gathered from the open country, and particularly\r\nfrom the vineyards, in some of which _Helix pomatia_ abounds. In the\r\n_Morning Post_ of 8th May 1868 there is an account of the operation of\r\nclearing the celebrated Clos de Vougeot vineyard of these creatures. No\r\nless than 240 gallons were captured, at a cost in labour of over 100\r\nfrancs, it being estimated that these snails would have damaged the\r\nvines to an extent represented by the value of 15 to 20 pipes of wine,\r\nagainst which may be set the price fetched by the snails when sold in\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nIt is generally considered dangerous to eat snails at once which have\r\nbeen gathered in the open country. Cases have occurred in which death\r\nby poisoning has resulted from a neglect of this precaution, since\r\nsnails feed on all manner of noxious herbs. Before being sent to table\r\nat the restaurants in the great towns, they are fattened by being fed\r\nwith bran in the same way as oysters.\r\n\r\nThe Roman Catholic Church permits the consumption of snails during\r\nLent. Very large numbers are eaten in France and Austria at this time.\r\nAt the village of Cauderon, near Bordeaux, it is the proper thing to\r\nend Carnival with especial gaiety, but to temper the gaiety with a dish\r\nof snails, as a foretaste of Lenten mortification.\r\n\r\nThe following species appear to be eaten in France at the present\r\nday: _H. pomatia_, _aspersa_, _nemoralis_, _hortensis_, _aperta_,\r\n_pisana_, _vermiculata_, _lactea_. According to Dr. Gray, the glassmen\r\nat Newcastle used to indulge in a snail feast once a year, and a recent\r\nwriter informs us that _H. aspersa_ is still eaten by working people in\r\nthe vicinity of Pontefract and Knottingley.[239] But in this country\r\nsnails appear to be seldom consciously used as an article of food;\r\nthe limitation is necessary, for Lovell tells us that they are much\r\nemployed in the manufacture of cream, and that a retired (!) milkman\r\npronounced it the most successful imitation known.\r\n\r\nPreparations made from snails used to be highly esteemed as a cure\r\nfor various kinds of diseases and injuries. Pliny the elder recommends\r\nthem for a cough and for a stomach-ache, but it is necessary “to take\r\nan uneven number of them.”[240] Five African slugs, roasted and beaten\r\nto a powder, with half a drachm of acacia, and taken with myrtle wine,\r\nis an excellent remedy for dysentery. Treated in various ways, snails\r\nhave been considered, in modern times, a cure for ague, corns, web\r\nin the eye, scorbutic affections, hectic fevers, pleurisy, asthma,\r\nobstructions, dropsy, swelling of the joints, headache, an impostume\r\n(whitlow), and burns. One of Pliny’s remedies for headache, which\r\ncompetes with the bones of a vulture’s head or the brain of a crow or\r\nan owl, is a plaister made of slugs with their heads cut off, which is\r\nto be applied to the forehead. He regards slugs as immature snails,\r\nwhose growth is not yet complete (_nondum perfectae_). Lovell\r\nstates that “a large trade in snails is carried on for Covent Garden\r\nmarket in the Lincolnshire fens, and that they are sold at 6d. per\r\nquart, being much used for consumptive patients and weakly children.”\r\n\r\nThe custom still seems to linger on in some parts of the country. Mr.\r\nE. Rundle, of the Royal Cornwall Infirmary, gives his experience in\r\nthe following terms: “I well remember, some twelve years since, an\r\nindividual living in an adjoining parish [near Truro] being pointed\r\nout to me as ‘a snail or slug eater.’ He was a delicate looking man,\r\nand said to be suffering from consumption. Last summer I saw this man,\r\nand asked him whether the statement that he was a ‘snail eater’ was\r\ntrue: he answered, ‘Yes, that he was ordered small white slugs--not\r\nsnails--and that up till recently he had consumed a dozen or more every\r\nmorning, and he believed they had done him good.’ There is also another\r\nuse to which the country people here put snails, and that is as an eye\r\napplication. I met with an instance a few weeks since, and much good\r\nseemed to have followed the use.”[241]\r\n\r\nA reverend Canon of the Church of England, whose name I am not\r\npermitted to disclose, informs me that there was a belief among the\r\nyouth of his native town (Pontypool, in Monmouthshire) that young\r\nslugs were ‘good for consumption,’ and that they were so recommended\r\nby a doctor who practised in the town. The slugs selected were about ¾\r\ninch long, “such as may be seen crawling on the turf of a hedge-bank\r\nafter a shower of rain.” They were “placed upon the tongue without\r\nany previous preparation, and swallowed alive.” My informant himself\r\nindulged in this practice for some time, “not on account of any\r\ngustatory pleasure it afforded, but from some vague notion that it\r\nmight do him good.”\r\n\r\nA colleague of mine at King’s College tells me that the country people\r\nat Ponteland, near Morpeth, habitually collect _Limax agrestis_\r\nand boil it in milk as a prophylactic against consumption. He has\r\nhimself frequently devoured them alive, but they must be swallowed, not\r\nscrunched with the teeth, or they taste somewhat bitter.\r\n\r\nSnails have occasionally fallen, with other noxious creatures, under\r\nthe ban of the Church. In a prayer of the holy martyr Trypho of\r\nLampsacus (about 10th cent. A.D.) there is a form of exorcism\r\ngiven which may be used as occasion requires. It runs as follows: “O\r\nye Caterpillars, Worms, Beetles, Locusts, Grasshoppers, Woolly-Bears,\r\nWireworms, Longlegs, Ants, Lice, Bugs, Skippers, Cankerworms,\r\nPalmerworms, _Snails_, Earwigs, and all other creatures that cling\r\nto and wither the fruit of the grape and all other herbs, I charge you\r\nby the many-eyed Cherubim, and by the six-winged Seraphim, which fly\r\nround the throne, and by the holy Angels and all the Powers, etc. etc.,\r\nhurt not the vines nor the land nor the fruit of the trees nor the\r\nvegetables of ---- the servant of the Lord, but depart into the wild\r\nmountains, into the unfruitful woods, in which God hath given you your\r\ndaily food.”\r\n\r\n=Prices given for Shells.=--Very high prices have occasionally been\r\ngiven for individual specimens, particularly about thirty or forty\r\nyears ago, when the mania for collecting was at its height. In those\r\ndays certain families, such as the Volutidae, Conidae, and Cypraeidae,\r\nwere the especial objects of a collector’s ardour, and he spared no\r\nexpense to make his set of the favourite genus as complete as possible.\r\nThus at Stevens’ auction-rooms in Covent Garden, on 21st July 1854,\r\none specimen of _Conus cedo nulli_ fetched £9: 10s., and another £16,\r\na _C. omaicus_ 16 guineas, _C. victor_ £10, and _C. gloria maris_,\r\nthe greatest prize of all, £43: 1s. At the Vernède sale, on 14th\r\nDec. 1859 two _Conus omaicus_ fetched £15 and £22, and a _C. gloria\r\nmaris_ £34. At the great Dennison sale, in April 1865, the _Conidae_\r\nfetched extravagant prices, six specimens averaging over £20 apiece.\r\n_Conus cedo nulli_ went for £18 and £22, _C. omaicus_ for £12, _C.\r\nmalaccanus_ for 10 guineas (this and one of the _cedo nulli_ being the\r\nactual specimens figured in Reeve’s _Conchologia Iconica_), _C. cervus_\r\nfor £19 and _C. gloria maris_ for £42. On 9th May 1866 a _Cypraea\r\nBroderipii_ was sold at Stevens’ auction-rooms for £13, and at the\r\nDennison sale a _Cypraea princeps_ fetched £40, and _C. guttata_ £42.\r\nThe _Volutidae_, although not quite touching these prices, have yet\r\ndone fairly well. Mr. Dennison’s _Voluta fusiformis_ sold for £6: 15s.,\r\n_V. papillaris_ for £5, _V. cymbiola_ for £5: 15s., _V. reticulata_\r\nfor eight guineas, and two specimens of the rarest of all Volutas, _V.\r\nfestiva_, for £14 and £16, both being figured in the _Conchologia_. At\r\nthe same sale, two unique specimens of _Oniscia Dennisoni_ fetched £17\r\nand £18 respectively, and, at the Vernède sale, _Ancillaria Vernèdei_\r\nwas bought for £6: 10s., and _Voluta piperata_ for £7: 10s.\r\n\r\nA unique specimen of a recent _Pleurotomaria_ (_quoyana_ F. and B.) was\r\npurchased by Miss de Burgh in 1873 for 25 guineas, and another species\r\nof the same genus (_adansoniana_ Cr. and F.), of extraordinary size and\r\nbeauty, is now offered for sale for about £100.\r\n\r\nBivalves have never fetched quite such high prices as univalves, but\r\nsome of the favourite and showy genera have gone near to rival them.\r\nOn 22nd June 1869, at Stevens’, _Pecten solaris_ fetched £4: 5s.,\r\n_P. Reevii_ £4: 8s., and _Cardita varia_ 5 guineas. Mr. Dennison’s\r\nspecimens of _Pecten subnodosus_ sold for £7, of _Corbula Sowerbyi_ for\r\n£10, of _Pholadomya candida_ for £8 and £13, while at the Vernède sale\r\na _Chama damicornis_ fetched £7.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n    REPRODUCTION--DEPOSITION OF EGGS--DEVELOPMENT OF THE FERTILISED\r\n         OVUM--DIFFERENCES OF SEX--DIOECIOUS AND HERMAPHRODITE\r\n             MOLLUSCA--DEVELOPMENT OF FRESH-WATER BIVALVES\r\n\r\n\r\nReproduction in the Mollusca invariably takes place by means of\r\neggs, which, after being developed in the ovary of the female, are\r\nfertilised by the spermatozoa of the male. As a rule, the eggs are\r\n‘laid,’ and undergo their subsequent development apart from the\r\nparent. This rule, however, has its exceptions, both among univalve\r\nand bivalve Mollusca, a certain number of which hatch their young\r\nfrom the egg before expelling them. Such ovoviviparous genera are\r\n_Melania_, _Paludina_, _Balea_, and _Coeliaxis_ among land and\r\nfresh-water Mollusca, and _Cymba_ and many _Littorina_ amongst marine.\r\nThe young of _Melania tuberculata_, in Algeria, have been noticed to\r\nreturn, as if for shelter, to the branchial cavity of the mother, some\r\ndays after first quitting it. Isolated species among Pulmonata are\r\nknown to be ovoviviparous, _e.g._ _Patula Cooperi_, _P. Hemphilli_,\r\nand _P. rupestris_, _Acanthinula harpa_, _Microphysa vortex_,\r\n_Pupa cylindracea_ and _muscorum_, _Clausilia ventricosa_, _Opeas\r\ndominicensis_, _Rhytida inaequalis_, etc. All fresh-water Pelecypoda\r\nyet examined, except _Dreissensia_, are ovoviviparous.\r\n\r\nThe number of eggs varies greatly, being highest in the Pelecypoda. In\r\n_Ostrea edulis_ it has been estimated at from 300,000 to 60,000,000;\r\nin _Anodonta_ from 14,000 to 20,000; in _Unio pictorum_ 200,000. The\r\neggs of _Doris_ are reckoned at from 80,000 to 600,000, of _Loligo_\r\nand _Sepia_ at about 30,000 to 40,000. Pulmonata lay comparatively few\r\neggs. _Arion ater_ has been observed to lay 477 in forty-eight days (p.\r\n42). Nests of _Helix aspersa_ have been noticed, in which the number\r\nof eggs varied from about 40 to 100. They are laid in little cup-shaped\r\nhollows at the roots of grass, with a little loose earth spread over\r\nthem. The eggs of _Testacella_ are rather large, and very elastic; if\r\ndropped on a stone floor they will rebound sharply several inches. The\r\n_Cochlostyla_ of the Philippines lay their eggs at the tops of the\r\ngreat forest trees, folding a leaf together to serve as a protection.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the great tropical _Bulimus_ and _Achatina_, together with\r\nthose of the _Macroön_ group of _Helix_ (_Helicophanta_, _Acavus_,\r\n_Panda_) are exceedingly large, and the number laid must be decidedly\r\nless than in the smaller Pulmonata. _Bulimus oblongus_, for instance,\r\nfrom Barbados, lays an egg about the size of a sparrow’s (Fig. 38),\r\n_Achatina sinistrorsa_ as large as a pigeon’s. The Cingalese _Helix\r\nWaltoni_ when first hatched is about the size of a full-grown _H.\r\nhortensis_. There is, in the British Museum, a specimen of the egg of a\r\n_Bulimus_ from S. America (probably _maximus_ or _popelairanus_) which\r\nmeasures exactly 1¾ inch in length.\r\n\r\nThe _Limnaeidae_ deposit their eggs in irregular gelatinous masses\r\non the under side of the leaves of water-plants, and on all kinds of\r\ndébris.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 38.--Newly-hatched young and egg of _Bulimus\r\n  oblongus_ Müll., Barbados. _Natural size._]\r\n\r\nThe _Rachiglossa_ or marine carnivorous families lay their eggs in\r\ntough leathery or bladdery capsules, which are frequently joined\r\ntogether in shapes which differ with the genus. Each capsule contains\r\na varying number of ova. The cluster of egg-capsules of _Buccinum\r\nundatum_ is a familiar object on all our sandy coasts. The capsules\r\nof _Purpura lapillus_ are like delicate pink grains of rice, set\r\non tiny stalks. They are not attached to one another, but are set\r\nclosely together in groups in sheltered nooks of the rocks. A single\r\n_Purpura_ has been observed to produce 245 capsules! _Busycon_ lays\r\ndisc-shaped capsules which are all attached at a point in the edge to\r\na cartilaginous band nearly 3 feet in length, looking like a number of\r\ncoins tied to a string at equal distances from one another. In _Murex\r\nerinaceus_ the egg-capsules are triangular, with a short stalk. They\r\nare deposited separately in clusters of from 15 to 150, there being\r\nabout 20 ova in each capsule. It appears that all the species of the\r\nsame genus have by no means the same method of depositing their eggs,\r\nnor do they always produce eggs of at all similar size or shape. Thus,\r\nof two British species of _Nassa_, _N. reticulata_ lays egg-capsules in\r\nshape like flattened pouches with a short stalk, and fastens them in\r\nrows to the leaves of _Zostera_; _M. incrassata_, on the other hand,\r\ndeposits solitary capsules, which are shaped like rounded oil-flasks.\r\n_Neptunea antiqua_ lays its eggs in bunched capsules, like _Bucc.\r\nundatum_ (Fig. 40), but the capsules of _N. gracilis_ are solitary.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 39.--Various forms of spawn in\r\n  _Prosobranchiata_: =A= and =D=, _Pyrula_ or _Busycon_; =B=,\r\n  _Conus_; =C=, _Voluta musica_; =E=, _Ampullaria_ (from specimens\r\n  in the British Museum); all × ⅔.]\r\n\r\nIn _Natica_ the eggs are deposited in what looks like a thick piece of\r\nsand-paper, curled in a spiral form (Fig. 41). The sand is agglutinated\r\nby copious mucus into a sort of sheet, and the eggs are let into this,\r\nsometimes (_N. heros_) in regular quincunx form. _Ianthina_ attaches\r\nits eggs to the under side of its float (Fig. 42). The Trochidae\r\ndeposit their eggs on the under side of stones and sea-weeds, each\r\novum being contained in a separate capsule, and all the capsules\r\nglued together into an irregular mass of varying size. The female of\r\n_Galerus chinensis_ hatches her eggs by keeping them between her foot\r\nand the stone she adheres to. They are laid in from 6 to 10 capsules,\r\nconnected by a pedicle and arranged like the petals of a rose, with\r\n10 to 12 eggs in each capsule. Those _Littorina_ which are not\r\novoviviparous deposit their spawn on sea-weeds, rocks, and stones. The\r\neggs are enveloped in a glairy mass which is just firm enough to retain\r\nits shape in the water; each egg has its own globule of jelly and is\r\nseparated from the others by a very thin transparent membrane.[242]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 40.--Egg-capsules of, =A=, _Nassa reticulata_\r\n  L. × ⅔; =B=, _Buccinum undatum_ L. × ⅔; =C=, _Neptunea antiqua_\r\n  L. × ⅓.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 41.--Spawn of a species of _Natica_ (from a\r\n  specimen in the British Museum) × ½.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 42.--_Ianthina fragilis_ Lam. =FL=, float;\r\n  =O=, ova; =Pr=, proboscis; =Br=, branchiae; =F=, foot. (Quoy and\r\n  Gaimard.)]\r\n\r\n_Chiton marginatus_, when kept in captivity, has been noticed[243] to\r\nelevate the posterior part of the girdle, and to pour out a continuous\r\nstream of flaky white matter like a fleecy cloud, which proved to be of\r\na glutinous nature. It then discharged ova, at the rate of one or two\r\nevery second, for at least fifteen minutes, making a total of 1300 to\r\n1500, each being about 1/100 inch diameter. The ova were shot into the\r\nglutinous cloud, which seemed to serve as a sort of nidus to entangle\r\nthe ova and prevent them being carried away. The subsequent development\r\nwas rapid, and in seven days the young _Chiton_ was hatched, being then\r\nabout 1/20 inch long. Lovén has described the same species as laying\r\nits eggs, loosely united in clusters of seven to sixteen, upon small\r\nstones. There is probably some mistake about the identification, but\r\nthe observation illustrates the varying methods of oviposition among\r\nallied forms.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 43.--Egg-capsules of =A=, _Sepia elegans_\r\n  Orb., and =B=, _Octopus vulgaris_ Lam.]\r\n\r\nNot very much is known with regard to the ovipositing of the\r\n_Cephalopoda_, especially those which inhabit deep water. Masses of\r\nova arranged in very various forms have occasionally been met with\r\nfloating in the ocean, but it is next to impossible to determine to\r\nwhat species, or even genus, they belong.[244]\r\n\r\nIn _Loligo punctata_ the ova are contained in small cylindrical cases\r\nmeasuring 3 to 4 in. by ½ in., to the number of about 250 ova in each\r\ncase. Hundreds of these cases are attached together like a bundle of\r\nsausages or young carrots, and the movements of the embryos within can\r\nbe distinctly noted. _Sepia officinalis_ lays large black pear-shaped\r\ncapsules, each of which is tied to some place of attachment by a kind\r\nof ribbon at the upper end of the capsule, the whole forming a large\r\ngroup like a bunch of grapes. _Octopus vulgaris_ deposits thousands\r\nof small berry-shaped ova, attached to a string which runs along the\r\ncentre of the mass (Fig. 43).\r\n\r\nThe so-called shell of the female _Argonauta_ is nothing more than a\r\nform of protection for the ova, and is in no sense homologous to the\r\nordinary molluscan shell. The ova consist of a large granulated mass,\r\nattached to a many branched stem; they are contained in the spire\r\nof the shell, in contact with the posterior part of the body of the\r\nmother, but sometimes project externally beyond the coil of the spire.\r\n\r\nCertain species possess the curious property of laying their eggs\r\non the outside of their own shells. _Buccinopsis Dalei_ is not\r\nunfrequently found decorated with its own egg-capsules. Possibly this\r\nspecies, which lives on oozy ground, finds this the only secure place\r\nof attachment for its progeny. _Neritina fluviatilis_ has a similar\r\nhabit, and so have many other species of _Neritina_ and _Navicella_.\r\nIt is not quite clear, in the latter cases, whether the eggs are laid\r\nby the specimens on whose shell they are found, or whether they are\r\ndeposited by others. In either case, perhaps the shell is the safest\r\nplace for them in the rapid streams which both genera frequent.\r\nSpecimens of _Hydrobia ulvae_ taken on the wet sands at the mouth\r\nof the Dee, are found to have several little rounded excrescences\r\nscattered over the surface of the shell. These, on examination, are\r\nfound to be little masses of small sand-grains, in the centre of which\r\nis a clear jelly containing segmenting ova or young embryos. Here\r\nagain, in all probability, the shell is the only comparatively stable\r\nobject, in the expanse of shifting sands, on which the eggs can be\r\nlaid.[245]\r\n\r\nThe pulmonate genus _Libera_, which occurs on a few of the island\r\ngroups in the Central Pacific, is remarkable for the habit of laying\r\nits eggs within its own cavernous umbilicus, which is narrowed at the\r\nlower part. The eggs number from four to six, or the same number of\r\nvery young shells may be seen closely packed in the cavity, each being\r\nin shape exactly like a young _Planorbis_. This constriction of the\r\numbilicus does not occur till the formation of the last two whorls,\r\n_i.e._ till the animal is sexually mature. Some species, but not all,\r\nprovide for the safety of their eggs more completely by forming a very\r\nthin shelly plate, which nearly closes the umbilical region, and breaks\r\naway or is absorbed to facilitate the escape of the young shells.[246]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Union of Limax.=--With regard to the act of union itself, the method\r\nin certain species of _Limax_ deserves special notice. _L. maximus_\r\nhas been observed at midnight to ascend a wall or some perpendicular\r\nsurface. A pair then crawl round and round one another emitting a\r\nquantity of mucus which at length forms a patch, 2 to 2½ inches in\r\ndiameter. When this acquires consistency the pair begin to twist round\r\neach other in corkscrew form, and detach themselves from the wall,\r\nhanging by a cord of the thickened mucus, about 8–15 inches long, and\r\nstill twisting round each other. The external generative organs are\r\nthen protruded and copulation takes place, after which the bodies\r\nuntwist, separate, and crawl up the cord again to the wall.[247]\r\n\r\n=Periodicity in Breeding.=--In the marine Mollusca, the winter months\r\nappear to be the usual time for the deposition of eggs. Careful\r\nobservations have been made on the Mollusca occurring at Naples,[248]\r\nand the general result seems to be that for all Orders alike the\r\nsix winter months from November to April, roughly speaking, are the\r\nbreeding time. Scarcely any forms appear to breed habitually in August,\r\nSeptember, or October. On our own coasts, Nudibranchiata come in shore\r\nto deposit their ova from January to April. _Purpura lapillus_ may\r\nbe observed depositing ova all the year round, but is most active\r\nfrom January to April. _Buccinum undatum_ breeds from October to May;\r\n_Littorina_ all the year round.\r\n\r\nThe land Mollusca exhibit rather more periodicity than the marine. In\r\ntemperate climates they breed exclusively in the summer months. In the\r\ntropics their periods are determined by the dry and rainy seasons,\r\nwhere such occur, otherwise they cohabit all the year round. According\r\nto Karl Semper, the snails of the warm Mediterranean region arrive at\r\nsexual maturity when they are six months old, _i.e._ before they are\r\nfully grown. After a rest of about three months during the heat of\r\nsummer, a second period of ovipositing occurs.[249] _Helix hortensis_\r\nand _H. nemoralis_ ascend trees, sometimes to a height of forty feet,\r\nwhen pairing.[250]\r\n\r\n=Hybridism= as the result of union between different species of\r\nMollusca is exceedingly rare. Lecoq once noticed[251] on a wall at\r\nAnduze (Gard) as many as twenty specimens of _Pupa cinerea_ united\r\nwith _Clausilia papillaris_. No offspring seem to have resulted from\r\nwhat the professor calls ‘this innocent error,’ for the wall was\r\ncarefully scrutinised for a long time, and no hybrid forms were ever\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nThe same observer noticed, in the Luxembourg garden at Paris, and\r\nM. Gassies has noticed[252] at various occasions, union between\r\n_Helix aspersa_ and _nemoralis_, _H. aspersa_ and _vermiculata_,\r\nbetween _Stenogyra decollata_ and a _Helix_ (sp. not mentioned), _H.\r\nvariabilis_ and _pisana_, _H. nemoralis_ and _hortensis_. In the two\r\nlatter cases a hybrid progeny was the result. It has been noticed that\r\nthese unions generally took place when the air was in a very electric\r\ncondition, and rain had fallen, or was about to fall, abundantly.\r\n\r\nOf marine species _Littorina rudis_ has been noticed[253] in union both\r\nwith _L. obtusata_ and with _L. littorea_, but no definite facts are\r\nknown as to the result of such unions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Self-impregnation= (see p. 44).\r\n\r\n=Development of the Fertilised Ovum.=--The first stages in the\r\ndevelopment of the Mollusca are identical with those which occur in\r\nother classes of animals. The fertilised ovum consists of a vitellus\r\nor yolk, which is surrounded with albumen, and is either contained in\r\na separate capsule, or else several, sometimes many, ova are found in\r\nthe same capsule, only a small proportion of which ultimately develop.\r\nThe germinal vesicle, which is situated at one side of the vitellus,\r\nundergoes unequal segmentation, the result of which is usually the\r\nformation of a layer of small ectoderm cells overlying a few much\r\nlarger cells which contain nearly the whole of the yolk. The large\r\ncells are then invaginated, or are simply covered by the growth of the\r\nectoderm cells. The result in either case is the formation of an area,\r\nthe blastopore, where the inner cells are not covered by the ectoderm.\r\nThe blastopore gradually narrows to a circular opening, which, in\r\nthe great majority of cases, eventually becomes the mouth. The usual\r\ndifferentiation of germinal layers takes place, the epiblast eventually\r\ngiving rise to the epidermis, nervous system, and special sense organs,\r\nthe hypoblast to the liver and to the middle region of the alimentary\r\ntract, the mesoblast to the muscles, the body cavity, the vascular,\r\nthe excretory and reproductive systems. The next, or _trochosphere_\r\n(_trochophora_) stage, involves the formation of a circlet of praeoral\r\ncilia, dividing the still nearly spherical embryo into two unequal\r\nportions, the smaller of which consists simply of the prostomium, or\r\npart in front of the mouth, the larger bearing the mouth and anus.\r\n\r\nSo far the series of changes undergone by the embryo are not\r\npeculiar to the Mollusca; we now come to those which are definitely\r\ncharacteristic of that group. The stage next succeeding the development\r\nof the trochosphere is the definitive formation of the _velum_, a\r\nprocess especially characteristic of the Gasteropoda and Pelecypoda,\r\nbut apparently not occurring in the great majority of land Pulmonata.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 44.--Veligers of _Dentalium entalis_ L.: =A=,\r\n  longitudinal section of a larva 14 hours old, × 285; =B=, larva\r\n  of 37 hours, × 165; =C=, longitudinal section of larva of 34\r\n  hours, × 165; _m_, mouth; _v_, _v_, velum. (After Kowalewsky.)]\r\n\r\nThe circlet of cilia becomes pushed more and more towards the anterior\r\nportion of the embryo, the cilia themselves become longer, while the\r\nportion of the body from which they spring becomes elevated into a\r\nridge or ring, which, as a rule, develops on each side a more or less\r\npronounced lobe. The name _velum_ is applied to this entire\r\nprocess of ciliated ring and lobes, and to the area which they enclose.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG.45.--Veliger of _Patella vulgata_ L., 130\r\n  hours old: _f_, rudimentary foot; _op_, operculum; _sh_, shell;\r\n  _v_, _v_, velum. (After Patten, highly magnified.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 46.--Developed larva of _Cyclas cornea_ L.:\r\n  _br_, rudimentary branchiae; _by_, byssus; _f_, foot; _m.e_,\r\n  mantle edge; _sh_, shell. (After Ziegler, highly magnified.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 47.--=A=, Advanced veliger of _Dreissensia_:\r\n  _f_, foot; _m_, mouth; _sh_, shell; _v_, _v_, velum. (After\r\n  Korschelt and Heider, much enlarged.) =B=, Veliger of a Pteropod\r\n  (_Tiedemannia_): _op_, operculum; _sh_, shell; _v_, velum. (After\r\n  Krohn, much enlarged.)]\r\n\r\nIn this so-called _veliger_ stage, the velum serves, in the first\r\nplace, to cause rotation of the larva within the egg-capsules, and,\r\nafter hatching, as an organ of locomotion. As a rule, the velum\r\ndisappears entirely in the adult mollusc after the free-swimming stage\r\nis over, but in the common _Limnaea stagnalis_ it persists, losing its\r\ncilia, as the very prominent circum-oral lobes. Simultaneously with\r\nthe development of the velum, and in some cases earlier, appear the\r\nrudiments of the shell-gland and of the foot, the latter being situated\r\non the ventral side, between the mouth and anus, the former on the\r\ndorsal side, behind the velum, and above the surface of the eventual\r\nvisceral sac. Thus the prime characteristics of the veliger stage,\r\nsubsequent to the appearance of the velum itself, are the development\r\nof the visceral sac and shell-gland on the upper, and of the foot on\r\nthe under side. According to Lankester the primitive shell-gland does\r\nnot, as a rule, directly give rise to the shell of the adult mollusc,\r\nbut becomes filled up by a horny substance, and eventually disappears;\r\nthe permanent shell then forms over the surface of the visceral hump\r\nfrom the original centre of the shell-gland. It is only in _Chiton_,\r\nand possibly in _Limax_, that the primitive shell-sac is retained and\r\ndeveloped into the final shell-forming area, which is much wider, and\r\nextends to the edges of the mantle. Within the velar area first appear\r\nthe rudiments of the tentacles and eyes; when these become developed\r\nthe velum atrophies and disappears.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these veligers when captured in the open sea have been\r\nmistaken for perfect forms, and have been described as such. Thus the\r\nlarva of _Dolium_ has been described as _Macgillivrayia_, that of a\r\n_Purpura_ as _Chelotropis_ and _Sinusigera_, that of _Aporrhais pes\r\npelecani_ as _Chiropteron_, that of _Marsenia conspicua_ as _Brownia_,\r\n_Echinospira_, and _Calcarella_.\r\n\r\n_Cephalopoda._--The embryonic development of the Cephalopoda is\r\nentirely distinct from that of all other Mollusca. The segmentation of\r\nthe vitellus is partial, and the embryo is furnished with a vitelline\r\nsac, which is very large in the majority of cases (Fig. 48). There\r\nis no free-swimming stage, but the embryo emerges from the egg fully\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\n=Differences of Sex.=--In the Mollusca there are two main types of\r\nsexual difference: (i) sexes separate (_dioecious_ type), (ii) sexes\r\nunited in the same individual (_hermaphrodite_ type).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 48.--Two stages in the development of _Loligo\r\n  vulgaris_ Lam.: _a_{1}_, _a_{1}_, first, and _a_{2}_, _a_{2}_,\r\n  second pairs of arms; _br_, branchiae, seen through _m_, mantle;\r\n  _e_, _e_, eyes; _fi_, fins; _fu_, funnel; _v.s_, vitelline sac.\r\n  (After Kowalewsky.)]\r\n\r\nIn some cases--_e.g._ certain Pelecypoda--what is practically a third\r\ntype occurs. The animal is hermaphrodite, but the male and female\r\nelements are not developed simultaneously, _i.e._ the same individual\r\nis at one time female, at another male.\r\n\r\n1. The sexes are separate in\r\n\r\n   All _Cephalopoda_.\r\n\r\n   _Gasteropoda Amphineura_ (except _Neomeniidae_).\r\n\r\n   _Gasteropoda Prosobranchiata_ (except _Valvata_ and\r\n   some species of _Marsenia_).\r\n\r\n   _Scaphopoda_.\r\n\r\n   Many _Pelecypoda_.\r\n\r\n2. The sexes are united in\r\n\r\n   _Gasteropoda Opisthobranchiata_.\r\n\r\n   _Gasteropoda Pulmonata_.\r\n\r\n   Certain _Pelecypoda_.[254]\r\n\r\nIn the dioecious Mollusca, sexual union is the rule, but is by no means\r\nuniversal. In some instances,--_e.g._ _Vermetus_, _Magilus_, _Patella_,\r\n_Haliotis_, _Crepidula_, _Chiton_, the _Scaphopoda_--the form and\r\nhabits of the animal do not admit of it; in others (many _Trochus_)\r\na male copulative organ is wanting. When this is the case, the male\r\nscatters the spermatozoa freely; the majority must perish, but some\r\nwill be carried by currents in the direction of the female.\r\n\r\nWhen the sexes are separate, the female is frequently larger than the\r\nmale. This is markedly the case in _Littorina_, _Buccinum_, and all the\r\n_Cephalopoda_; in _Argonauta_ the difference is extreme, the male not\r\nbeing more than ¼ the size of the female.\r\n\r\nThose hermaphrodite Mollusca which are capable of sexual union\r\n(Gasteropoda, Pulmonata, and Opisthobranchiata) are conveniently\r\ndivided into two sections, according as (1) there are separate\r\norifices for the male and female organs, or (2) one orifice serves for\r\nboth. To the former section (_Digonopora_[2]) belong the Limnaeidae,\r\nVaginulidae, and Onchidiidae, and many Opisthobranchiata, including\r\nall the Pteropoda; to the latter (_Monogonopora_[255]) nearly all the\r\nNudibranchiate Opisthobranchiata, and all the rest of the Pulmonata.\r\nIn the latter case during union, mutual impregnation takes place, and\r\neach of the two individuals concerned has been observed (compare p.\r\n42) to deposit eggs. In the former, however, no such reciprocal act\r\ncan take place, but the same individual can play the part of male to\r\none and female to another, and we sometimes find a string of _Limnaea_\r\nthus united, each being at once male and female to its two adjacent\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Reproductive System.=--Broadly speaking, the complicated\r\narrangements which are found in Mollusca resolve themselves into\r\nmodifications of three important factors:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _gonads_ or _germ-glands_, in which are developed the ova\r\nand the spermatozoa. These glands are generally known as the _ovary_ in\r\nthe female, the sperm-gland or _testis_ in the male.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The channels which provide for the passage of the seminal\r\nproducts; namely, the _oviduct_ in the female, the _vas deferens_ or\r\nsperm-duct in the male.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The external generative organs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 49.--Generative and other organs of\r\n  _Littorina obtusata_ L., _female_.\r\n\r\n    =A=, anus.\r\n    =Br=, branchia.\r\n    =Buc=, buccal mass.\r\n    =H=, heart.\r\n    =Hep=, hepatic duct.\r\n    =I=, continuation of oesophagus.\r\n    =Ki=, kidney.\r\n    =Li=, liver.\r\n    =M=, muscle of attachment.\r\n    =O´=, female orifice.\r\n    =Od=, oviduct.\r\n    =Oes=, oesophagus.\r\n    =Ov=, ovary.\r\n    =Ra=, radula.\r\n    =St=, stomach.\r\n    =U=, uterus.\r\n\r\n  (After Souleyet.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 50.--Generative and other organs of\r\n  _Littorina obtusata_ L., _male_.\r\n\r\n    =A=, anus.\r\n    =Br=, branchia.\r\n    =H=, heart.\r\n    =I=, intestine.\r\n    =Li=, liver.\r\n    =M=, muscle of attachment.\r\n    =Pe=, penis.\r\n    =Te=, testis.\r\n    =VD=, vas deferens.\r\n\r\n  (After Souleyet.)]\r\n\r\n=Dioecious Mollusca.=--The common _Littorina obtusata_ will serve as\r\na typical instance of a dioecious prosobranchiate, exhibiting the\r\nsimplest form of organs. In the female the _ovary_, a lobe-shaped\r\nbody, is embedded in the liver. An _oviduct_ with many convolutions\r\nconveys the ova into the _uterus_, an oblong chamber which consists\r\nsimply of a dilatation of the oviduct. The ova descend into the uterus,\r\nwhich is sometimes furnished with a seminal pouch. In this seminal\r\npouch, or above it, in the oviduct, the ova come into contact with\r\nthe spermatozoa. The lower part of the uterus secretes a gelatinous\r\nmedium (or capsule, as the case may be) in which the fertilised ova\r\nbecome enclosed previous to exclusion. In position the oviduct abuts\r\non the kidney, while the uterus is in close proximity to the rectum,\r\nand the female external orifice is found close to the anus, within the\r\nbranchial cavity.\r\n\r\nThe male organs of _Littorina_ are more simple. The _testis_ is lodged,\r\nlike the ovary, in the liver; the _vas deferens_ is, like the oviduct,\r\nconvoluted, and eventually traverses the right side of the neck,\r\nemerging near the right tentacle, and terminating in the _penis_ or\r\nexternal copulative organ (Fig. 50).\r\n\r\nThis system prevails, with but slight modifications in detail,\r\nthroughout the prosobranchiate Gasteropoda. The most important\r\nmodification is the passage of the seminal products in certain cases\r\n(many of the Diotocardia) through the right kidney, with which the\r\noviduct and vas deferens always stand in close relation. The same\r\narrangement occurs in the Scaphoda and some Pelecypoda.\r\n\r\nThe penis varies greatly in form and size. In the Strombidae (see\r\nFig. 99) and Buccinidae (Fig. 62) it is very large and prominent; in\r\n_Littorina_ it is somewhat spinulose at one side; in _Paludina_ a\r\nportion of it is lodged in the right tentacle, which becomes atrophied\r\nand much more obtuse than the tentacle on the left side.\r\n\r\n=Spermatozoa.=--The shape of the spermatozoa and of the ova in\r\nMollusca is of the usual type. In _Paludina Ampullaria_, and certain\r\nspecies of _Murex_ two types of spermatozoa occur, one hair-like,\r\nthe other worm-like, three times as long as the former, and not\r\ntapering at one end. The former type alone take part in fertilisation,\r\nand penetrate the ovum. It has been suggested that these worm-like\r\nspermatozoa are a kind of incipient ova, and indicate a possible\r\nstage in commencing hermaphroditism. And, since the nearest allies of\r\nthe Prosobranchiata (in which these types occur) are hermaphrodite\r\n(_i.e._ the Opisthobranchiata and Pulmonata), it is not unreasonable\r\nto suppose that the Prosobranchiata should show some tendency towards\r\nhermaphroditism in their genital glands.[256]\r\n\r\n=Cephalopoda.=--The special characteristic of the reproductive organs\r\nin female Cephalopoda is the development of various glands, some of\r\nconsiderable size, in connexion with the ovary and oviduct. _Sepia_,\r\n_Loligo_, and _Sepiola_ are furnished with two large _nidamental\r\nglands_, which open into the mantle cavity independently of the\r\noviduct. Their purpose is to produce a viscid mucus, which envelops the\r\nova at the moment of their emission and eventually hardens into the\r\negg-capsules. A pair of accessory nidamental glands occur in _Sepia_,\r\nas well as a pair of smaller glands situated on the oviduct itself.\r\n\r\nIn many of the male Cephalopoda the vas deferens is long and dilated\r\nat its outer end into a glandular reservoir, within which are formed\r\nthe spermatophores, or narrow cylindrical packets which contain a very\r\nlarge number of spermatozoa. When charged, the spermatophores pass\r\ninto what is known as Needham’s sac, where they remain until required\r\nfor use. These spermatophores are a very characteristic part of the\r\nreproductive arrangements in the Cephalopoda. The male of _Sepia_ has\r\nbeen noticed to deposit them, during union, upon the buccal membrane\r\nof the female. During the emission of the ova by the female, the\r\nspermatophores, apparently through the agency of a kind of spring\r\ncontained at one end, burst, and scatter the spermatozoa over the ova.\r\n\r\n=The Hectocotylus Arm.=--Perhaps the most remarkable feature in the\r\nsexual relations of all the Mollusca is the so-called _hectocotylus_\r\nof the Cephalopoda. In the great majority of the male Cephalopoda, one\r\nof the ‘arms,’ which is modified for the purpose in various ways and\r\nto a greater or less extent, becomes charged with spermatophores, and\r\nsometimes, during union, becomes detached and remains within the mantle\r\nof the female, preserving for some considerable time its power of\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThe hectocotylus is confined to the dibranchiate Cephalopoda, and\r\nits typical form, _i.e._ when part of the arm becomes disengaged and\r\nleft with the female, occurs only in three genera of the Octopodidae,\r\n_viz._[_Argonauta_, _Ocythoe_ (_Philonexis_), and _Tremoctopus_. In\r\nall of these, the male is many sizes smaller than the female. In\r\n_Argonauta_ the third arm on the left side becomes hectocotylised. At\r\nfirst it is entirely enveloped in a kind of cyst, in such a way that\r\nonly a small portion of the tip projects; subsequently the cyst parts\r\nasunder, and allows the arm to become expanded to its full length,\r\nwhich considerably exceeds that of the other arms. At a certain point\r\nthe acetabula or suckers terminate, and the remainder of the arm\r\nconsists of a very long, tapering, sometimes thread-like filament,\r\nwhich is pointed at the extreme tip. It is not yet known how the\r\nspermatophores find their way into the hectocotylus, or how the\r\nhectocotylus impregnates the ova of the female. The arm thus affected\r\nis not always the same. In _Tremoctopus_ it is the third of the right\r\nside, in the _Decapoda_ the modification usually affects the fourth of\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 51.--Male of _Ocythoe tuberculata_ Raf. (=\r\n  _Philonexis catenulatus_ Fér.), Mediterranean, showing three\r\n  stages, =A=, =B=, and =C=, in the development of the hectocotylus\r\n  arm: _h.cy_, hectocotylus still in the cyst; _c´y´_, spoon-shaped\r\n  cyst at the end of the arm when freed; _th_, thread-like organ\r\n  freed by the rupture of _c´y´_. Natural size. From specimens in\r\n  the British Museum.]\r\n\r\nThis singular property of the male Cephalopoda has only recently\r\nbeen satisfactorily explained. It is true that Aristotle, more than\r\ntwenty-two centuries ago, distinctly stated that certain of the arms\r\nwere modified for sexual purposes. Speaking of what he calls the\r\npolypus (which appears to represent the _Octopus vulgaris_ of the\r\nMediterranean), he says: ‘It differs from the female in having what the\r\nfishermen call the white sexual organ _on its arm_;’ again, ‘Some say\r\nthat the male has something of a sexual nature (αὶδοιῶδές τι) on one of\r\nits arms, that on which the largest suckers occur; that this is a kind\r\nof muscular appendage attached to the middle of the arm, and that it is\r\nentirely introduced within the funnel of the female’. Unfortunately the\r\nword translated by _introduced_ is corrupt, and can only be restored\r\nconjecturally. He again remarks, ‘The last of the arms, which tapers to\r\na fine point and is the only whitish arm, it uses in sexual union.’[257]\r\n\r\nThe typical hectocotylus seems to have entirely escaped notice until\r\nearly in the present century, when both Delle Chiaje and Cuvier\r\ndescribed it, as detected within the female, as a _parasite_, the\r\nlatter under the name of _Hectocotylus octopodis_. Kölliker, in\r\n1845–49, regarded the Hectocotylus of _Tremoctopus_ as the entire male\r\nanimal, and went so far as to discern in it an intestine, heart, and\r\nreproductive system. It was not until 1851 that the investigations of\r\nVérany and Filippi confirmed a suggestion of Dujardin,[258] while H.\r\nMüller, in 1853, completed the discovery by describing the entire male\r\nof _Argonauta_.\r\n\r\nIn all genera of dibranchiate Cephalopoda except _Argonauta_,\r\n_Ocythoe_, and _Tremoctopus_, one of the arms is sexually modified\r\nin various ways, but never becomes so much prolonged, and is never\r\ndetached and left with the female. In _Loligo Forbesii_ Stp. the fourth\r\narm on the left has 23 pairs of regularly developed acetabula, which\r\nthen lessen in size and disappear, being replaced by long pedunculated\r\npapillae, of which there are about 40 pairs. In _Loligo vulgaris_ Lam.\r\nand _L. Pleii_ Orb. 18 or 19 pairs of acetabula are regularly formed,\r\nand then occur 40 pairs of papillae, as in _Forbesii_. In other species\r\nof _Loligo_ (_gahi_ Orb., _brevis_ Bl., _brasiliensis_ Orb.) only the\r\nouter row of suckers becomes modified into papillae after about the\r\n20th to the 22nd pair. In _Sepioteuthis sepioides_ the modification\r\nis the same as in the _Loligo_ last mentioned, but the corresponding\r\narm on the right side is so covered with acetabula towards its extreme\r\nend, that it is thought that it in some way co-operates with the\r\nhectocotylised left arm.\r\n\r\nIn _Octopus_, the third arm on the right side is subject to\r\nmodification. This arm is always shorter than the corresponding arm on\r\nthe other side, and carries fewer suckers, but is furnished at the\r\nextreme tip with a peculiar kind of plate, which connects with the\r\nmembrane at the base of the arm by a channel of skin, which probably\r\nconveys the spermatophores up to the tip.\r\n\r\nIn _Octopus vulgaris_, the species referred to by Aristotle, the\r\nhectocotylised arm is short, thin in its outer half and pointed at the\r\nextremity, while the fold of skin is very white, and gives the arm\r\nan appearance of being divided by a cleft at the side. At the same\r\ntime, an unusual development of one or two suckers on the arm is not\r\nuncommon.[259]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 52.--_Octopus lentus_ Baird, N. Atlantic,\r\n  showing the peculiar formation of the hectocotylus arm, _h.a_.\r\n  (After Verrill, × ½.)]\r\n\r\nIt is believed that in the Tetrabranchiate Cephalopoda (_Nautilus_) a\r\nunion of the four inner ventral arms may correspond functionally to the\r\nhectocotylising of the arm in the Dibranchiates.\r\n\r\n=Hermaphrodite Mollusca.=--(_a_) _Monogonopora._--The reproductive\r\nsystem in the hermaphrodite Mollusca is far more complicated than in\r\nthe dioecious, from the union of the male and female organs in the same\r\nindividual. As a type of the Monogonopora, in which a single orifice\r\nserves for both male and female organs, may be taken the common garden\r\nsnail (_Helix aspersa_), the accompanying figure of which is drawn from\r\ntwo specimens found in the act of union (Fig. 53).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 53.--Genitalia of _Helix aspersa_ Müller,\r\n  drawn from two individuals in the act of union, from a dissection\r\n  by F.

Within this gland\r\nare developed the ova and spermatozoa. The former are rather large\r\nround cells, produced within the outer wall of the gland, while\r\nthe spermatozoa, which are produced in the more central part, are\r\nthread-like bodies, generally aggregated in small bundles. From the\r\nhermaphrodite gland the ova and spermatozoa pass through the upper\r\npart of the _hermaphrodite duct_ (H.D.), which is always more or less\r\nconvoluted. Below the convoluted portion, the duct opens into the\r\n_albumen gland_ (A.G.), a large linguiform mass of tissue which becomes\r\ndilated at the time of pairing, and secretes a thick viscid fluid which\r\nprobably serves to envelop the ova. Up to this point both the male and\r\nfemale elements follow the same course, but on their exit from the\r\nalbumen gland they diverge. The hermaphrodite duct becomes greatly\r\nenlarged, and is partially divided by a kind of septum into a male and\r\nfemale portion. These run parallel to one another, the larger or female\r\nportion (H.DF.), through which the ova pass (and which is sometimes\r\ntermed the _uterus_) being dilated into a number of puckered folds,\r\nwhile the smaller or male portion (H.DM.) is comparatively narrow,\r\nand not dilated. At their anterior end, the two portions of the duct\r\nseparate completely from one another, the female portion being then\r\ntermed the _oviduct_ (OV.) and the male portion the _vas deferens_\r\n(V.D.).\r\n\r\nFollowing first the oviduct, we find that it soon widens into the\r\n_vagina_ (V.), which is furnished with a pair of _mucous glands_\r\n(M.G.), one on each side. These are much branched, and resemble little\r\nbunches of whitish seaweed. A little above the mucous glands a long\r\ntube diverges from the vagina, which is furnished with a produced\r\n_coecum_ (C.) and a pouch, the _spermatheca_ (SP.) at the extreme\r\nend. In this pouch, and in the duct leading to it, is stored the\r\nspermatophore received in union with another snail. Just below the\r\nmucous glands the vagina is joined by the _dart sac_ (D.S.), which is\r\nmore fully described below. Finally, at its lower end the vagina unites\r\nwith the penis sac at a point just posterior to the common orifice.\r\n\r\nReturning now to the male organs, we find that the _vas deferens_\r\nis the continuation of the male portion of the hermaphrodite duct,\r\nafter its final separation from the female portion. It passes under\r\nthe retractor muscle of the upper right tentacle, which has been cut\r\naway in the specimen figured, to dissect it out. Just before the vas\r\ndeferens widens into the penis sac, it branches off into a long and\r\ntapering tube, the _flagellum_, in which the spermatozoa are stored and\r\nbecome massed together in the long packet known as the _spermatophore_.\r\nThe _penis sac_ (P.S.) is the continuation of the vas deferens beyond\r\nthe point at which the flagellum diverges. It joins the vagina at\r\nits extreme anterior end, uniting with it to form the common genital\r\naperture, which cannot be exactly represented in the figure. The\r\n_penis_ itself lies in the interior of the penis sac, and is a rather\r\nlong muscular tube which is protruded during union, but at other times\r\nremains retracted within the sac.\r\n\r\nIn the Helicidae generally, the form of the generative organs varies\r\nwith each separate species, sometimes merely as regards the size of\r\nthe different parts, at others in the direction of greater simplicity\r\nor complication. The mucous glands may be absent, and the flagellum\r\ngreatly reduced in size, or absent altogether.\r\n\r\n=The Dart Sac.=--A remarkable part of the reproductive system in many\r\nof the true Helicidae is the so-called _dart_, _Liebespfeil_, or _telum\r\nveneris_. It consists of ‘a straight, or curved, sometimes slightly\r\ntwisted tubular shaft of carbonate of lime, tapering to a fine point\r\nabove, and enlarging gradually, more often somewhat abruptly, to\r\nthe base.’ The sides of the shaft are sometimes furnished with two\r\nor more blades; these are apparently not for cutting purposes, but\r\nsimply to brace the stem. The dart is contained in a dart sac, which\r\nis attached as a sort of pocket to the vagina, at no great distance\r\nfrom its orifice. There are four different forms of sac. It may be\r\nsingle or double, and each of these divisions may be bilobed, each lobe\r\ncontaining one dart at a time. In _Helix aspersa_ the dart is about\r\n5/16 in. in length, and ⅛ in. in breadth at its base (see Fig. 54).\r\n\r\nIt appears most probable that the dart is employed as an adjunct to\r\nthe sexual act. Besides the fact of the position of the dart sac\r\nanatomically, we find that the darts are extruded and become embedded\r\nin the flesh just before or during the act of copulation. It may\r\nbe regarded, then, as an organ whose punctures induce excitement\r\npreparatory to sexual union. It only occurs in well-grown specimens.\r\nWhen once it begins to form, it grows very rapidly, perhaps not more\r\nthan a week being required for its entire formation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 54.--Darts of British land snails: =A=,\r\n  _Hyalinia excavata_ Bean; =B=, _Helix hortensis_ Müll.; =C=,\r\n  _Helix aspersa_ Müll. (After Ashford.)]\r\n\r\nThe dart is almost confined to _Helicidae_, a certain number of\r\nexceptions being known which border on _Helix_. _Hyalinia nitida_ and\r\n_excavata_ are the only British species, not _Helices_, which are known\r\nto possess it. It has not been noticed to occur in the slugs, except in\r\nthe N. American genus _Tebennophorus_. About one-third of the British\r\nHelices are destitute of the dart.[260] _H. rufescens_ possesses a\r\ndouble bilobed sac, but only two darts, which lie in the lower lobes.\r\nIt does not use the darts, and could not do so, from the relative sizes\r\nof dart and sac; it has often been watched when uniting, but the use of\r\nthe darts has never been observed. From this it has been inferred that\r\nthe darts are degenerate weapons of defence, and that they were in fact\r\nat one time much stronger organs and more often used.[261] This theory,\r\nhowever, does not seem consistent with the whole circumstances of the\r\noccurrence, position, and present use of the darts.\r\n\r\n=Hermaphrodite Mollusca.=--(_b_) _Digonopora._--As an example of\r\nthe _Digonopora_ or hermaphrodite Mollusca with separate generative\r\napertures for the male and female organs, we may take the common\r\n_Limnaea stagnalis_ (Fig. 55). It will be seen from the figure that\r\nthe relative positions of the hermaphrodite gland and duct, and of\r\nthe albumen gland, are the same as in _Helix_. When the oviduct parts\r\ncompany from the vas deferens, it becomes furnished with several\r\naccessory glands, one of which (GL.E.) probably serves as a reservoir\r\nfor the ova, and answers more or less to a uterus. The tube leading to\r\nthe spermatheca is short, and there is no divergent caecum. The female\r\norifice lies near to the external opening of the branchial cavity. The\r\nvas deferens, which is very long, is furnished with a large prostate\r\ngland. The penis sac is greatly dilated, and there is no flagellum. The\r\nmale orifice is behind the right tentacle, slightly in advance of the\r\nfemale orifice (compare Fig. 102).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 55.--Genitalia of _Limnaea stagnalis_ L.\r\n  (from a dissection by F. B. Stead), × 2.\r\n\r\n    =A.G=, albumen gland.\r\n    =Ac.G=, accessory gland.\r\n    =F.O=, female orifice.\r\n    =Gl.E=, glandular enlargement.\r\n    =H.D=, hermaphrodite duct.\r\n    =H.G=, hermaphrodite gland.\r\n    =Li=, liver.\r\n    =M.O=, male orifice.\r\n    =P=, penis sac.\r\n    =Pr=, prostate.\r\n    =R.M=, retractor muscle of penis.\r\n    =Sp=, spermatheca.\r\n    =V.D=, vas deferens.]\r\n\r\nMost of the _Opisthobranchiata_, but not all, have separate sexual\r\norifices. Numerous variations from the type just described will be\r\nfound to occur, particularly in the direction of the development of\r\naccessory glands, which are sometimes very large, and whose precise\r\npurpose has in many cases not been satisfactorily determined.\r\n\r\n_Pelecypoda._--In the dioecious Pelecypoda, which form the great\r\nmajority, the reproductive system is simple, and closely parallel in\r\nboth sexes. It consists of a pair of gonads, which are either ovaries\r\nor testes, and a pair of oviducts or sperm-ducts which lead to a\r\ngenital aperture. The gonads are usually placed symmetrically at the\r\nsides or base of the visceral mass. The oviduct is short, and the\r\ngenital aperture is usually within the branchial chamber, thus securing\r\nthe fertilisation of the ova by the spermatozoa, which are carried into\r\nthe branchial chamber with the water which passes through the afferent\r\nsiphon.\r\n\r\nHermaphrodite Pelecypoda are rare, the sexes being usually separate.\r\nThe following are assured instances: _Pecten glaber_, _P. jacobaeus_,\r\n_P. maximus_, _Ostrea edulis_, _Cardium norvegicum_, _Pisidium\r\npusillum_, _Cyclas cornea_, _Pandora rostrata_, _Aspergillum\r\ndichotomum_, and perhaps _Clavagella_. The greater number of these\r\nhave only a single genital gland (gonad) on each side, with a single\r\nefferent duct from each, but part of the gland is male and part female,\r\n_e.g._ in the Pectens above mentioned. _Pandora_ and _Aspergillum_ have\r\ntwo distinct glands, respectively male and female, on each side, each\r\nof the two glands possessing its separate duct, and the two ducts from\r\neach side eventually opening near one another. It appears probable that\r\nthe _Septibranchiata_ (_Cuspidaria_, _Poromya_, _Lyonsiella_, etc.)\r\nmust also be added to the number of hermaphrodite Pelecypoda which have\r\nseparate male and female glands.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark that all the hermaphrodite Pelecypoda belong to\r\nforms decidedly specialised, while forms distinctly primitive, such as\r\n_Nucula_, _Solenomya_, _Arca_, and _Trigonia_ are all dioecious. In\r\nGasteropoda similarly, the least specialised forms (the _Amphineura_,\r\nwith the exception of the _Neomeniidae_, and the _Rhipidoglossa_)\r\nare dioecious. It is possible therefore that in the ancestors of the\r\nMollusca the separation of the sexes had already become the normal\r\ntype of things, and that hermaphroditism in the group is, to a certain\r\nextent, a sign or accompaniment of specialisation.[262]\r\n\r\n=Development of Fresh-water Bivalves.=--The vast majority of\r\nfresh-water bivalves either pass the larval stage entirely within\r\nthe mother, and do not quit her except in a perfectly developed form\r\n(_Cyclas_, _Pisidium_), or assume a mode of development in which free\r\nlarvae indeed occur, but are specially modified for adaptation to\r\nspecial circumstances (_Unio_). _Cyclas_ and _Pisidium_, and no doubt\r\nall the kindred genera, preserve their ova in a sort of brood-pouch\r\nwithin the gills, in which the ova pass the earlier stages of their\r\ndevelopment. But, even so, the larva of these genera retains some\r\ntraces of its original free-swimming habits, for a rudimentary velum,\r\nwhich is quite useless for its present form of development, has been\r\ndetected in _Cyclas_.\r\n\r\nThe larva of _Dreissensia_ (see Fig. 47, A), so far as is at present\r\nknown, stands alone among fresh-water bivalves in being free-swimming,\r\nand to this property has been attributed, no doubt with perfect\r\njustice, the fact of the extraordinarily rapid spread of _Dreissensia_\r\nover the continent of Europe (chap. xvi.). In expelling the ova,\r\nthe parent slightly opens the shells and then quickly closes them,\r\nshooting out a small point of white slime, which is in fact a little\r\nball of eggs. The general course of development is precisely parallel\r\nto that of marine _Pelecypoda_, greatly resembling, so far as form is\r\nconcerned, certain stages in the growth of the larvae of _Modiolaria_\r\nand _Cardium_, as figured by Lovén.[263]\r\n\r\nIn June and July the larvae appear in large numbers on the surface of\r\nthe water, when in spite of their exceedingly small size, they can\r\nbe captured with a fine hand-net. They pass about eight days on the\r\nsurface, feeding apparently on minute floating algae. During this time,\r\nthe principal change they undergo is in the formation of the foot,\r\nwhich first appears as a small prominence midway between the mouth\r\nand anus, and gradually increases in length and flexibility. When the\r\nlarva sinks to the bottom, the velum soon disappears entirely, the\r\nfoot becomes exceedingly long and narrow, while the shell is circular,\r\nstrongly resembling a very young _Cyclas_.\r\n\r\n=Larvae of Unionidae.=--The early stages of the development of _Unio_\r\nand _Anodonta_ (so far as the species of North America, Europe, and\r\nAsia are concerned) is of extreme interest, from the remarkable fact\r\nthat the young live for some time parasitically attached to certain\r\nspecies of fresh-water fishes. In order to secure this attachment,\r\nthe larva, which is generally known as _Glochidium_, develops a long\r\nfilament which perhaps renders it aware of the neighbourhood of a fish,\r\nand also a larval shell furnished with strong hooks by which it fastens\r\nitself to the body of its unconscious host (Fig. 56). According to some\r\ninteresting observations made by Mr. O. H. Latter,[264] the ova pass\r\ninto the external gill of the mother, in which is secreted a nutritive\r\nmucus on which they are sustained until they arrive at maturity and a\r\nsuitable opportunity occurs for their ‘being born.’ If this opportunity\r\nis deferred, and the _Glochidia_ mature, their so-called ‘byssus’\r\nbecomes developed, and by being entangled in the gill filaments of the\r\nparent, prevents their escaping. It is interesting to notice that, when\r\nthe nutritive mucus of the parent is used up, it becomes, as it were,\r\nthe turn of the children to provide for themselves a secondary mode of\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 56.--=A=, _Glochidium_ immediately after it\r\n  is hatched: _ad_, adductor muscle; _by_, ‘byssus’ cord; _s_,\r\n  sense organs; _sh_, shell. =B=, _Glochidium_ after it has been on\r\n  the fish for some weeks: _a.ad_, _p.ad_, anterior and posterior\r\n  adductors; _al_, alimentary canal; _au.v_, auditory vesicle;\r\n  _br_, branchiae; _f_, foot; _mt_, mantle. (Balfour.)]\r\n\r\nThe mother _Anodonta_ does not always retain the _Glochidium_ until\r\nfish are in her neighbourhood. Gentle stirring of the water caused\r\nthem to emit _Glochidium_ in large masses, if the movement was not so\r\nviolent as to cause alarm. The long slimy masses of _Glochidium_ were\r\nobserved to be drawn back again within the shell of the mother, even\r\nafter they had been ejected to a distance of 2 or 3 inches.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to assert that the young _Glochidium_ can swim. When\r\nthey finally quit the mother, they sink to the bottom, and there\r\nremain resting on their dorsal side, with the valves gaping upwards and\r\nthe so-called byssus streaming up into the water above them. There they\r\nremain, until a convenient ‘host’ comes within reach, and if no ‘host’\r\ncomes within a certain time, they perish. They are evidently peculiarly\r\nsensitive to the presence of fish, but whether they perceive them by\r\nsmell or some other sense is unknown. “The tail of a recently killed\r\nstickleback thrust into a watch-glass containing _Glochidium_ throws\r\nthem all into the wildest agitation for a few seconds; the valves are\r\nviolently closed and again opened with astonishing rapidity for 15–25\r\nseconds, and then the animals appear exhausted and lie placid with\r\nwidely gaping shells--unless they chance to have closed upon any object\r\nin the water (_e.g._ another _Glochidium_), in which case the valves\r\nremain firmly closed.”\r\n\r\nIn about four weeks after the _Glochidium_ has quitted its host, and\r\nthe permanent shell has made its appearance _within_ the two valves\r\nof the _Glochidium_, the projecting teeth of the latter press upon\r\nthe ventral edge of the permanent shell, at a point about half way in\r\nits lengthward measurement, retarding the growth of the shell at that\r\nparticular point, and indenting its otherwise uninterrupted curve with\r\nan irregular notch or dent. As growth proceeds, this dent becomes less\r\nand less perceptible on the ventral margin of the shell itself, but its\r\neffects may be detected, in well-preserved specimens, by the wavy turn\r\nin the lines of growth, especially near the umbones of the young shell.\r\n\r\nMr. Latter found that all species of fish with which he experimented\r\nhad a strong dislike to _Glochidium_ as an article of food. Sometimes\r\na fish would taste it “just to try,” but invariably spit it out again\r\nin a very decided manner. The cause of unpleasantness seemed not to be\r\nthe irritation produced in the mouth of the fish by the attempt of the\r\n_Glochidium_ to attach itself, but was more probably due to what the\r\nfish considered a nasty taste or odour in the object of his attentions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following works will be found useful for further study of this\r\nportion of the subject:--\r\n\r\n   =F.

The blood is purified by being brought, in successive\r\ninstalments, into contact with pure air or pure water, the effect of\r\nwhich is to expel the carbonic acid produced by animal combustion, and\r\nto take up fresh supplies of oxygen. Whether the medium in which a\r\nmollusc lives be water or air, the effect of the respiratory action is\r\npractically the same.\r\n\r\nBroadly speaking, Mollusca whose usual habitat is the water ‘breathe’\r\nwater, while those whose usual habitat is the land ‘breathe’ air. But\r\nthis rule has its exceptions on both sides. The great majority of the\r\nfresh-water Mollusca which are not provided with an operculum (_e.g._\r\n_Limnaea_, _Physa_, _Planorbis_), breathe air, in spite of living in\r\nthe water. They make periodic visits to the surface, and take down\r\na bubble of air, returning again for another when it is exhausted.\r\nOn the other hand many marine Mollusca which live between tide-marks\r\n(_e.g._ _Patella_, _Littorina_, _Purpura_, many species of _Cerithium_,\r\n_Planaxis_, and _Nerita_) are left out of the water, through the\r\nbi-diurnal recess of the tide, for many hours together. Such species\r\ninvariably retain several drops of water in their branchiae, and,\r\naided by the moisture of the air, contrive to support life until the\r\nwater returns to them. Some species of _Littorina_ (_e.g._ our own _L.\r\nrudis_ and many tropical species) live so near high-water mark that\r\nat neap-tides it must frequently happen that they are untouched by\r\nthe sea for several weeks together, while they are frequently exposed\r\nto a burning sun, which beats upon the rocks to which they cling. In\r\nthis case it appears that the respiratory organs will perform their\r\nfunctions if they can manage to retain an extremely small amount of\r\nmoisture.[265]\r\n\r\nThe important part which the respiratory organs play in the economy of\r\nthe Mollusca may be judged from the fact that the primary subdivision\r\nof the Cephalopoda into Dibranchiata and Tetrabranchiata is based\r\nupon the number of branchiae they possess. Further, the three great\r\ndivisions of the Gasteropoda have been named from the position or\r\ncharacter of the breathing apparatus, _viz_. Prosobranchiata,\r\nOpisthobranchiata and Pulmonata, while the name Pelecypoda has hardly\r\nyet dispossessed Lamellibranchiata, the more familiar name of the\r\nbivalves.\r\n\r\nRespiration may be conducted by means of--(_a_) Branchiae or Gills,\r\n(_b_) a Lung or Lung-cavity, (_c_) the outer skin.\r\n\r\nIn the Pelecypoda, Cephalopoda, Scaphopoda, and the great majority of\r\nthe Gasteropoda, respiration is by means of branchiae, also known as\r\n_ctenidia_[266], when they represent the primitive Molluscan gill and\r\nare not ‘secondary’ branchiae (pp. 156, 159).\r\n\r\nIn all non-operculate land and fresh-water Mollusca, in the\r\nAuriculidae, and in one aberrant operculate (_Amphibola_), respiration\r\nis conducted by means of a lung-cavity, or rarely by a true lung,\r\nwhence the name _Pulmonata_. The land operculates (Cyclophoridae,\r\nCyclostomatidae, Aciculidae, and Helicinidae) also breathe air, but are\r\nnot classified as Pulmonata, since other points in their organisation\r\nrelate them more closely to the marine Prosobranchiata. Both methods of\r\nrespiration are united in _Ampullaria_, which breathes indifferently\r\nair through a long siphon which it can elevate above the surface of the\r\nwater, and water through a branchia (see p. 158). _Siphonaria_ (Fig.\r\n57) is also furnished with a lung-cavity as well as a branchia. Both\r\nthese genera may be regarded as in process of change from an aqueous\r\nto a terrestrial life, and in _Siphonaria_ the branchia is to a great\r\nextent atrophied, since the animal is out of the water, on the average,\r\ntwenty-two hours out of the twenty-four. In the allied genus _Gadinia_,\r\nwhere there is no trace of a branchia, but only a lung-cavity, and\r\nin _Cerithidea obtusa_, which has a pulmonary organisation exactly\r\nanalogous to that of _Cyclophorus_,[267] this process may be regarded\r\nas practically completed.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 57.--=A=, _Siphonaria gigas_ Sowb., Panama,\r\n  the animal contracted in spirit: _gr_, siphonal groove on right\r\n  side. =B=, _Gadinia peruviana_, Sowb., Chili, shell only: _gr_,\r\n  mark of siphonal groove to right of head.]\r\n\r\nRespiration by means of the skin, without the development of any\r\nspecial organ, is the simplest method of breathing which occurs in the\r\nMollusca. In certain cases, _e.g._ _Elysia_, _Limapontia_, and _Cenia_\r\namong the Nudibranchs, and the parasitic _Entoconcha_ and _Entocolax_,\r\nnone of which possess breathing organs of any kind, the whole outer\r\nsurface of the body appears to perform respiratory functions. In\r\nothers, the dorsal surface is covered with papillae of varied size and\r\nnumber, which communicate with the heart by an elaborate system of\r\nveins. This is the case with the greater number of the _Aeolididae_\r\n(Fig. 58, compare Fig. 5, C), but it is curious that when the animal is\r\nentirely deprived of these papillae, respiration appears to be carried\r\non without interruption through the skin.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 58.--_Aeolis despecta_ Johnst., British\r\n  coasts. (After Alder and Hancock.)]\r\n\r\nIn the development of a distinct breathing organ, it would seem as if\r\nprogress had been made along two definite lines, each resulting in\r\nthe exposure of a larger length of veins, _i.e._ of a larger amount\r\nof blood, to the simultaneous operation of fresh air or fresh water.\r\nEither (_a_) the skin itself may have developed, at more or less\r\nregular intervals, elevations, or folds, which gradually took the form\r\nof papillae, or else (_b_) an inward folding, or ‘invagination,’ of\r\nthe skin, or such a modification of the mantle-fold as is described\r\nbelow (p. 172) may have taken place, resulting in the formation of a\r\ncavity more or less surrounded by walls, within which the breathing\r\norgans were ultimately developed. Sometimes a combination of both\r\nprocesses seems to have occurred, and after a papilliform organ has\r\nbeen produced, an extension or prolongation of the skin has taken\r\nplace, in order to afford a protection to it. Respiration by means of a\r\nlung-cavity is certainly subsequent, in point of time, to respiration\r\nby means of branchiae.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 59.--_Chiton squamosus_ L., Bermuda: =A=,\r\n  anus; =Br=, branchiae; =M=, mouth.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 60.--_Fissurella virescens_ Sowb., Panama,\r\n  showing position of the branchiae: =Br=, branchiae: =E=, =E=,\r\n  eyes; =F=, foot; =M=, mantle; =T=, =T=, tentacles.]\r\n\r\nThe branchiae seem to have been originally paired, and arranged\r\nsymmetrically on opposite sides of the body. It is not easy to decide\r\nwhether the multiple form of branchia which occurs in _Chiton_ (Fig.\r\n59), or the simple form as in _Fissurella_ (Fig. 60), is the more\r\nprimitive. Some authorities hold that the multiple branchia has\r\ngradually coalesced into the simple, others that the simple form has\r\ngrown, by serial repetition, into the multiple. There appears to be no\r\ntrace of any intermediate forms, and, as a matter of fact, the multiple\r\nbranchia is found only in the _Amphineura_, while one or rarely\r\ntwo (never more) pairs of branchiae, occur, with various important\r\nmodifications, in the vast majority of the Mollusca.\r\n\r\n_Amphineura._--In _Chiton_ the branchiae are external, forming a long\r\nrow of short plumes, placed symmetrically along each side of the foot.\r\nThe number of plumes, at the base of each of which lies an osphradial\r\npatch, varies from about 70 to as few as 6 or 7. When the plumes are\r\nfew, they are confined to the posterior end, and thus approximate\r\nto the form and position of the branchiae in the other Amphineura.\r\nIn _Chaetoderma_, the branchiae consist of two small feather-shaped\r\nbodies, placed symmetrically on either side of the anus, which opens\r\ninto a sort of cloaca within which the branchiae are situated. In\r\n_Neomenia_ the branchiae are still further degraded, consisting\r\nof a single bunch of filaments lying within the cloaca, while in\r\n_Proneomenia_ there is no more than a few irregular folds on the\r\ncloaca-wall (Fig. 61).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 61.--Terminal portions of the Amphineura,\r\n  illustrating the gradual degradation of the branchiae, and\r\n  their grouping round the anus in that class. =A=, _Chiton_\r\n  (_Hemiarthrum_) _setulosus_ Carp., Torres Str.; =B=, _Chiton_\r\n  (_Leptochiton_) _benthus_ Hadd., Torres Str.; =C=, _Chaetoderma_;\r\n  =D=, _Neomenia_; _a_, anus; _br_, _br_, branchiae; _k_, _k_,\r\n  kidneys; _p_, pericardium. (=A= and =B= after Haddon, =C= and =D=\r\n  after Hubrecht.)]\r\n\r\nIn the _Prosobranchiata_, symmetrically paired branchiae occur only\r\nin the Fissurellidae, Haliotidae, and Pleurotomariidae, in the former\r\nof which two perfectly equal branchiae are situated on either side\r\nof the back of the neck. These three families taken together form\r\nthe group known as _Zygobranchiata_.[268] In all other families the\r\nasymmetry of the body has probably caused one of the branchiae,\r\nthe right (originally left), to become aborted, and consequently\r\nthere is only one branchia, the left, in the vast majority of\r\nmarine Prosobranchiata, which have been accordingly grouped as\r\n_Azygobranchiata_. Even in _Haliotis_ the right branchia is rather\r\nsmaller than the left, while the great size of the attachment muscle\r\ncauses the whole branchial cavity to become pushed over towards the\r\nleft side. In those forms which in other respects most nearly approach\r\nthe Zygobranchiata, namely, the Trochidae, Neritidae, and Turbinidae,\r\nthe branchia has two rows of filaments, one on each side of the long\r\naxis, while in all other Prosobranchiata there is but one row (see Fig.\r\n79, p. 169).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 62.--_Bullia laevissima_ Gmel., showing\r\n  branchial siphon =S=; =F=, =F=, =F=, foot; =OP=, operculum; =P=,\r\n  penis; =Pr=, proboscis; =T=, =T=, tentacles. (After Quoy and\r\n  Gaimard.)]\r\n\r\nIn the great majority of marine Prosobranchiata the branchia is\r\nsecurely concealed within a chamber or pouch (the respiratory cavity),\r\nwhich is placed on the left dorsal side of the animal, generally near\r\nthe back of the neck. For breathing purposes, water has to be conveyed\r\ninto this chamber, and again expelled after it has passed over the\r\nbranchia. In the majority of the vegetable-feeding molluscs (_e.g._\r\n_Littorina_, _Cerithium_, _Trochus_) water is carried into the chamber\r\nby a simple prolongation of one of the lobes or lappets of the mantle,\r\nand makes its exit by the same way, the incoming and outgoing currents\r\nbeing separated by a valve-like fringe depending from the lobe. In the\r\ncarnivorous molluscs, on the other hand, a regular tube, the _branchial\r\nsiphon_, which is more or less closed, has been developed from a fold\r\nof the mantle surface, for the special purpose of conducting water to\r\nthe branchia. After performing its purpose there, the spent water does\r\nnot return through the siphon, but is conducted towards the anus by\r\nvibratile cilia situated on the branchiae themselves. In a large number\r\nof cases, this siphon is protected throughout its entire length by a\r\nspecial prolongation of the shell called the canal. Sometimes, as in\r\n_Buccinum_ and _Purpura_, this canal is little more than a mere notch\r\nin the ‘mouth’ of the shell, but in many of the Muricidae (_e.g._ _M.\r\nhaustellum_, _tenuispina_, _tribulus_) the canal becomes several inches\r\nlong, and is set with formidable spines (see Fig. 164, p. 256). In\r\n_Dolium_ and _Cassis_ the canal is very short, but the siphon is very\r\nlong, and is reflected back over the shell.\r\n\r\nThe presence or absence of this siphonal notch or canal forms a fairly\r\naccurate indication of the carnivorous or vegetarian tendencies of most\r\nmarine Prosobranchiata, which have been, on this basis, subdivided\r\ninto _Siphonostomata_ and _Holostomata_. But this classification is\r\nof no particular value, and is seriously weakened by the fact that\r\n_Natica_, which is markedly ‘holostomatous,’ is very carnivorous, while\r\n_Cerithium_, which has a distinct siphonal notch, is of vegetarian\r\ntendencies.\r\n\r\nIn the Zygobranchiata the water, after having aerated the blood in the\r\nbranchiae, usually escapes by a special hole or holes in the shell,\r\nsituated either at the apex (_Fissurella_) or along the side of the\r\nlast whorl (_Haliotis_). In _Pleurotomaria_ the slit answers a similar\r\npurpose, serving as a sluice for the ejection of the spent water, and\r\nthus preventing the inward current from becoming polluted before it\r\nreaches the branchiae (see Fig. 179, p. 266).\r\n\r\nIn _Patella_ the breathing arrangements are very remarkable. In spite\r\nof their apparent external similarity, this genus possesses no such\r\nsymmetrically paired plume-shaped branchiae as _Fissurella_, but we\r\nnotice a circlet of gill-lamellae, which extends completely round the\r\nedge of the mantle. It has been shown by various authorities that\r\nthese lamellae are in no sense morphologically related to the paired\r\nbranchiae in other Mollusca, but only correspond to them functionally.\r\nThe typical paired branchiae, as has been shown by Spengel, exist\r\nin _Patella_ in a most rudimentary form, being reduced to a pair\r\nof minute yellow bodies on the right and left sides of the back of\r\nthe ‘neck.’ A precisely similar abortion of the true branchiae, and\r\nspecial development of a new organ to perform their work, is shown in\r\n_Phyllidia_ and _Pleurophyllidia_ (see below under Opisthobranchiata).\r\nThis circlet of functional gills in _Patella_ has therefore little\r\nsystematic value, being only developed in an unusual position, like\r\nthe eyes on the mantle in certain _Pelecypoda_, to supply the place of\r\nthe true organs which have fallen into disuse. Accordingly Cuvier’s\r\nclass of _Cyclobranchiata_, which included _Patella_ and _Chiton_, has\r\nno value, and has indeed long been discarded. In _Chiton_ the gills\r\nnever extend completely round the animal, but are always more or less\r\ninterrupted at the head and anus. They are the true gills, the plumes\r\nbeing serially repeated in the same way as the shell plates.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 63.--_Patella vulgata_ L., seen from the\r\n  ventral side: _f_, foot; _g.l_, circlet of gill lamellae; _m.e_,\r\n  edge of the mantle; _mu_, attachment muscle; _sl_, slits in the\r\n  same; _sh_, shell; _v_, vessel carrying aerated blood to the\r\n  heart; _v´_, vessel carrying blood from the heart; _ve_, small\r\n  accessory vessels.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 64.--_Patella vulgata_ L., seen from the\r\n  dorsal side after the removal of the shell and the black pigment\r\n  covering the integument; the anterior portion of the mantle is\r\n  cut away or turned back: _a_, anus; _br_, _br_, remains of the\r\n  true branchiae (ctenidia); _i_, intestine; _k_, _k´_, kidneys;\r\n  _k.ap_, their apertures on each side of the anus; _l_, liver;\r\n  _m_, _m_, mantle; _mu_, attachment muscles, severed in removal of\r\n  shell; _t_, _t_, tentacles.]\r\n\r\nIn the land Prosobranchiata (Cyclostomatidae, Cyclophoridae,\r\nAciculidae, Helicinidae) which, having exchanged a marine for an\r\naerial life, breathe air instead of water, the branchia has completely\r\ndisappeared, and breathing is conducted, as in the Pulmonata, by a\r\nlung-cavity. In certain genera of land operculates, _e.g._ _Pupina_,\r\n_Cataulus_, _Pterocyclus_, a slight fissure or tube in the last whorl\r\n(see Fig. 180, p. 266) serves to introduce air into the shell, which\r\nis perhaps otherwise closed to air by the operculum. In _Aulopoma_,\r\nwhich has no tube, the operculum admits free circulation of air. In\r\ncertain other Cyclostomatidae the apex is truncated, and air can enter\r\nthere. De Folin closed with wax the aperture of _Cycl. elegans_, and\r\nfound that on placing it in a pneumatic machine, the shell gave off\r\nair through its whole surface. On the other hand, _Cylindrella_ and\r\n_Stenogyra decollata_, on being submitted to the same test, showed that\r\nthe truncated part alone was permeable by air.\r\n\r\nFischer and Bouvier have made some interesting observations on the\r\nbreathing of a species of _Ampullaria_ (_insularum_ Orb.). The species\r\nhas, in common with all _Ampullaria_, two siphons, but while the\r\nright siphon is but slightly developed, the left is very long, almost\r\ntwice as long as the shell (see Fig. 65). The animal, when under the\r\nwater, lengthens its siphon, brings the orifice to the surface, and by\r\nalternately raising and depressing its head produces in the pulmonary\r\nsac movements of ex- and inspiration; these are repeated about ten or\r\nfifteen times at regular intervals of from six to eight seconds, a\r\nmethod of respiration strongly resembling that of the Cetacea. At the\r\nsame time, branchial respiration takes place. If powdered carmine is\r\nadded to water, the particles are seen to enter the branchial cavity\r\nby the siphon and pass out by the short right siphon. Sometimes the\r\nanimal remains under water for hours without rising to the surface to\r\ninspire air. In _Valvata_ (Fig. 66) the branchia is very large, and\r\nprojects like a leaf or fan above the shell on the left side; on the\r\ncorresponding position on the right side is a long filiform appendage,\r\nwhich some have regarded as representing the other branchia.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 65.--_Ampullaria insularum_ Orb.: =A=,\r\n  breathing water; =B=, breathing air; =Si=, siphon; =T=, upper;\r\n  _t_, lower tentacles; =X=, pallial expansion, performing the part\r\n  of excurrent siphon. (After Fischer and Bouvier, x ⅓.)]\r\n\r\n_Opisthobranchiata._--A true branchia occurs only in the\r\nTectibranchiata and the Ascoglossa. It lies on the right side, and is\r\nusually more or less external, being partly covered sometimes by the\r\nshell (as in _Umbrella_, Fig. 5), sometimes by a fold of the mantle. In\r\nthe Pteropoda (which are probably derived from the Tectibranchiata),\r\nall the Thecosomata, with the exception of _Cavolinia_, have no\r\nspecialised branchia, but probably respire through portions or the\r\nwhole of the integument. In the Gymnosomata an accessory branchia\r\nhas in many cases been developed at the posterior end of the body.\r\n_Pneumodermon_ alone has both lateral and posterior branchiae well\r\ndeveloped, _Clione_ and _Halopsyche_ are destitute of either, while the\r\nfour remaining families have one branchia, sometimes lateral, sometimes\r\nposterior.[269]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 66.--_Valvata piscinalis_ Müll.: _br_,\r\n  branchia; _fi_, filament; _f.l_, foot lobes. (After Boutan.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 67.--_Doris_ (_Archidoris_) _tuberculata_ L.,\r\n  Britain: _a_, anus; _br_, branchiae, surrounding the anus; _m_,\r\n  male organ; _rh_, _rh_, rhinophores. × ⅔.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 68.--_Pleurophyllidia lineata_ Otto,\r\n  Mediterranean: _a_, anus; _br_, secondary branchiae; _m_, mouth;\r\n  _s.o_, sexual orifice.]\r\n\r\nCertain of the Nudibranchiata possess no special breathing organs, and\r\nprobably respire through the skin (_Elysia_, _Limapontia_, _Cenia_,\r\n_Phyllirrhoë_). The majority, however, have developed secondary\r\nbranchiae, in the form of prominent lobes or leaf-like processes (the\r\n_cerata_), which are carried upon the back, without any means of\r\nprotection. These cerata are, as a rule, of extreme beauty and variety\r\nof form, consisting sometimes of long whip-like tentaculae, in other\r\ncases of arborescent plumes of fern-like leafage, in others of curious\r\nbead-like appendages of every imaginable shape and colour. In _Doris_\r\nthey lie at the posterior end of the body, in a sort of rosette, which\r\nis generally capable of retraction into a chamber. In _Phyllidia_ and\r\n_Pleurophyllidia_ these secondary branchiae lie, as in _Patella_, on\r\nthe lateral portions of the mantle.\r\n\r\nThe Scaphopoda in all probability possess neither true nor secondary\r\nbranchiae.\r\n\r\n_Pulmonata._--When we use the term ‘lung,’ it must be remembered that\r\nthis organ in the Mollusca does not correspond, morphologically, with\r\nthe spongy, cellular lung of vertebrates; it simply performs the same\r\nfunctions. The ‘lung,’ in the Mollusca, is a pouch or cavity, lined\r\nwith blood-vessels which are disposed over its vaulted surface in\r\nvarious patterns of network. The pulmonary sac or cavity is therefore a\r\nbetter name by which to denote this organ.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 69.--_Geomalacus maculosus_ Allm., S.\r\n  Ireland: =P.O=, pulmonary orifice.]\r\n\r\nIt seems probable, as has been already shown (pp. 18–22), that all\r\nPulmonata are ultimately derived from marine forms which breathed\r\nwater by means of branchiae. Thus we find intermediate forms, such as\r\n_Siphonaria_, possessed of both a branchia and a pulmonary sac, the\r\nformer being evanescent, while in _Gadinia_ and _Amphibola_ it has\r\nquite disappeared. In the vast majority of _Pulmonata_ no trace of\r\na branchia remains; its function is performed by a chamber, always\r\nsituated at the right side of the animal, and generally more or less\r\nanterior, admitting air by a narrow aperture which is rhythmically\r\nopened and closed. In _Arion_ and _Geomalacus_ (Fig. 69) this aperture\r\nis in the front of the right side of the ‘shield,’ in _Limax_ (Fig. 71)\r\nin the hinder part, in _Testacella_ (Fig. 20) it is near the extremity\r\nof the tail, under the spire of the shell; in _Janella_ it is on\r\nthe middle of the right edge of the shield (Fig. 70). If a specimen\r\nof _Helix aspersa_, or better, of _H. pomatia_, is held up to the\r\nlight, the beautiful arborescent vessels, with which the upper part\r\nof the pulmonary chamber is furnished, can be clearly seen by looking\r\nthrough the aperture as it dilates. It is only in the Auriculidae\r\nthat an actual spongy mass of lung material appears to exist. When\r\nin motion, a _Helix_ inspires air much more frequently than when at\r\nrest. Temperature, too, seems to affect the number of inspirations; it\r\nappears doubtful whether, during hibernation, a snail breathes at all.\r\nIn any case, the amount of air required to sustain life must be small.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 70.--_Janella hirudo_ Fisch., N. Caledonia:\r\n  =G=, generative orifice; =P=, pulmonary orifice; =T=, =T=,\r\n  tentacles. (After Fischer.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 71.--_Limax maximus_ L.: =PO=, pulmonary\r\n  orifice. × ⅔.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the respiration of fresh-water Pulmonata there appears\r\nto be some difference of opinion. It is held, on the one hand, that\r\nthe Limnaeidae only respire air, making periodic visits to the surface\r\nto procure it, and that they perish, if prevented from doing so, by\r\nasphyxiation. If, we are told,[270] as a _Limnaea_ is floating on\r\nthe surface of the water in a glass jar, a morsel of common salt be\r\ndropped upon its outstretched foot, it will sink heavily to the bottom,\r\nemitting a stream of air from its pulmonary orifice. On recovering\r\nfrom the shock, it will anxiously endeavour to regain the surface, but\r\nwill have some difficulty in doing so, owing to its now much greater\r\nspecific gravity. When it succeeds, it creeps almost out of the\r\nwater, and exposes its respiratory orifice freely to the air. If the\r\nexperiment is repeated several times on the same individual, it becomes\r\nso much weakened that it has to be taken out of the water to save its\r\nlife. Moquin-Tandon, on the other hand, is strongly of opinion[271]\r\nthat there is no absolute necessity for _Limnaea_ to obtain air by\r\nrising to the surface, and that, if prevented from emerging, it can\r\nobtain air from the water. When covered in by a roof of ice, _Limnaea_\r\nhas not been observed to suffer any inconvenience. Moquin-Tandon kept\r\n_L. glabra_ and _Planorbis rotundatus_ in good health under 20 mm.\r\nof water for eighteen and nineteen days, and relates a case in which\r\n_Physa_ was kept alive under water for four days, and _Planorbis_ for\r\ntwelve. Young specimens, both of _Limnaea_ and _Planorbis_, do not rise\r\nto the surface for a supply of air; they are hatched with the pulmonary\r\ncavity full of water.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, therefore, that Limnaeidae are capable, on occasion,\r\nof respiration through the skin. Some authorities are of opinion that\r\ncertain long and narrow lamellae, situated within the pulmonary sac,\r\nare employed for the purpose of aqueous respiration. _Ancylus_, which\r\nnever makes periodic excursions to the surface, perhaps respires by\r\nreceiving into its pulmonary chamber the minute quantities of oxygen\r\ngiven off by the vegetation on which it feeds.\r\n\r\nLimnaeidae taken from a great depth of water, _e.g._ from 130 fathoms\r\nin the lake of Geneva, have been examined by Forel.[272] The pulmonary\r\nsac is full of water, but there is no transformation of organs, no\r\nappearance of a branchia, to meet the changed circumstances of their\r\nenvironment. Doubtless a good deal of respiration is done by the skin;\r\nbeing soft and vascular, it respires the air dissolved in the water.\r\nForel cites cases of _Limnaea_ living at much shallower depths, which\r\ncome to the surface once, and then remain below for months. The oxygen\r\nof this supply must soon have become exhausted, and the animals,\r\ndiscontinuing for a time the use of the pulmonary chamber, must have\r\nrespired through the skin. Shallow-water _Limnaea_, according to the\r\nsame authority, remain beneath the surface during cold weather; when\r\nwarm weather returns they rise to the surface to take in a supply of\r\nair. Since the water at great depths is always very cold, there is no\r\nneed for the _Limnaea_ living there to rise to the surface at all.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious fact that _Limnaea_, which have been respiring by\r\nthe skin for the whole winter, should suddenly, on the first warm\r\ndays of summer, take to rising to the surface and breathing air. But\r\nexactly the same phenomenon is shown in the case of _Limnaea_ from\r\ngreat depths. Placed in an aquarium, they _immediately_ begin rising\r\nto the surface and inspiring air; in other words, they experience\r\ninstantaneously a complete transformation of their respiratory system.\r\n\r\nIn _Onchidium_, a land pulmonate which has retrogressed to an\r\namphibious or quasi-marine mode of life, there is no organ which\r\nrepresents the pulmonary or branchial cavity, the so-called lung being\r\nonly a cavity of the kidney. Respiration is, however, conducted by the\r\nskin as well, and by the dorsal papillae.[273]\r\n\r\nLand Mollusca can sustain, for a considerable time, complete\r\ndeprivation of atmospheric air. Helices placed in an exhausted receiver\r\nshow no signs of being inconvenienced for about 20 hours, and are able\r\nto survive for about two or three days. If detained under water, they\r\nare very active for about 6 hours, then become motionless, the body\r\nswells, owing to the water absorbed, and death ensues in about 36\r\nhours. Immersion for only 24 hours is generally followed by recovery.\r\nIn the latter case, the cause of death is not so much deprivation\r\nof air as compulsory absorption of water by the skin. The amount of\r\nwater thus taken up is surprising. Spallanzani found that a _Helix_\r\nwhich weighed 18 grammes increased in weight by 13½ grammes after a\r\nprolonged immersion. Even slugs enclosed in moist paper gained more\r\nthan 2 grammes in the course of half an hour. Experiment has shown\r\nthat the amount of carbonic acid gas produced by respiration stands in\r\ndirect relation to the amount of food consumed. Four pairs of snails\r\nwere taken which had recently awakened from their winter sleep and had\r\neaten heartily, and an equal number, under the same circumstances,\r\nwhich had been prevented from eating. It was found that the first\r\nfour pairs produced, in consuming a given amount of oxygen, 11, 9,\r\n10, and 13 parts respectively of carbonic acid, while the second\r\nset produced, in consuming the same amount of oxygen, only 4, 8, 7,\r\nand 9 parts of carbonic acid.[274] Hibernating Helices, if weighed\r\nin December and again in April, will be found to have lost weight,\r\ndue to the expiration of carbonic acid. Owing to the difficulty of\r\nexperiment, opinions vary as to the absolute temperature of snails. It\r\nappears to be established that several snails, if placed together in\r\na tube, raise the temperature one or two degrees C., but as a rule,\r\nthe temperature of a solitary _Helix_ differs very slightly from that\r\nof the surrounding air. Increased activity, whether in respiration or\r\nfeeding, is found to raise the temperature.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 72.--_Cardium edule_ L.: =A=, anal; =B=,\r\n  branchial siphon; =F=, foot. (After Möbius.)]\r\n\r\nW. H. Dall, writing of the branchia in _Pelecypoda_, remarks[275]\r\nthat there can be no doubt that its original form was a simple\r\npinched-up lamella or fold of the skin or mantle. This, elongated,\r\nbecomes a filament. Filaments united by suitable tissue, trussed,\r\npropped, and stayed by a chitinous skeleton, result in the forms,\r\nwonderful in number and complexity, which puzzle the student to\r\ndescribe, much more to classify.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 73.--_Scrobicularia piperata_ Gmel., in its\r\n  natural position in the sand: =A=, efferent or anal siphon; =B=,\r\n  afferent or branchial siphon. (After Möbius.)]\r\n\r\nIn Pelecypoda the branchiae are placed on each side of the body,\r\nbetween the mantle and the visceral mass. They lie in a chamber known\r\nas the _branchial cavity_. Leading into this cavity, and behind it,\r\nare, as a rule, two tubes or siphons, one of which conducts water to\r\nthe branchiae, while the other carries it away after it has passed over\r\nthem. The lower is known as the _branchial_ or _afferent_ siphon, the\r\nupper as the _anal_ or _efferent_ siphon (see Figs. 72 and 73). The\r\naction of these siphons can readily be observed by placing a little\r\ncarmine in water, near to the siphonal apertures of an _Anodonta_ or\r\n_Unio_. In many cases (_e.g._ _Psammobia_, _Tellina_, _Mya_, genera\r\nwhich burrow deeply in sand) both the siphons are exceedingly long,\r\nsometimes considerably longer than the whole shell. In some cases the\r\ntwo tubes are free throughout their entire length, in others they\r\nbecome fused together before their entrance within the shell (Fig.\r\n74). In other genera, which do not burrow (_e.g._ _Ostrea_, _Pecten_,\r\n_Arca_, _Mytilus_), the siphons are rudimentary or altogether absent\r\n(Fig. 75).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 74.--_Solecurtus strigillatus_ L., Naples:\r\n  _s.af_, afferent siphon; _s.ef_, efferent siphon, the two uniting\r\n  in _SS_ externally to the shell, × ½.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 75.--_Mytilus edulis_ L., attached by its\r\n  byssus (=By=) to a piece of wood: =F=, foot; =S=, anal siphon,\r\n  the branchial siphon being below it and not closed. (After\r\n  Möbius.)]\r\n\r\nThe number and arrangement of the branchiae varies considerably. It\r\nappears probable that the different degrees of complication of the\r\ngill indicate degrees of specialisation in the different groups of\r\nPelecypoda, in other words, assuming that a simpler form of gill\r\nprecedes, in point of development, a more complicated form, the nature\r\nof the gill may be taken as indicating different degrees of removal\r\nfrom the primitive form of bivalve.\r\n\r\n1. The simplest form of gill (_Nucula_, _Leda_, _Solenomya_, etc.)\r\nis that which consists (Fig. 76, A, compare Fig. 100, p. 201) of two\r\nrows of very short, broad, not reflected filaments, the rows being\r\nplaced in such a way that they incline at right angles to one another\r\nfrom a common longitudinal axis. The filaments are not connected with\r\none another, nor are the two leaves of each gill united at any point.\r\n(_Protobranchiata._)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 76.--Morphology of the branchiae\r\n  of Pelecypoda, seen diagrammatically in section:\r\n  =A=, _Protobranchiata_; =B=, _Filibranchiata_; =C=,\r\n  _Eulamellibranchiata_; =D=, _Septibranchiata_; _e_, _e_, external\r\n  row of filaments; _i_, _i_, internal row of filaments; _e´_,\r\n  external row or plate folded back; _i´_, internal row folded\r\n  back; _f_, foot; _m_, mantle; _s_, septum; _v_, visceral mass.\r\n  (From A. Lang.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 77.--Four gill filaments of _Mytilus_, highly\r\n  magnified; _cj_, ciliary junctions; _f_, filament. (After Peck.)]\r\n\r\n2. In the _Anomiidae_, _Arcadae_, _Trigoniidae_, and _Mytilidae_ each\r\ngill consists of two plates or rows of much longer filaments, which\r\nconsequently occupy a much larger space in the mantle cavity (Fig.\r\n76, B). Unable to extend beyond the limits of the mantle, filaments\r\nare reflected or doubled back upon one another, those of the external\r\nplate being reflected towards the outside, those of the internal plate\r\ntowards the inside. Each separate filament is not connected with the\r\nfilament next adjacent, except by surface cilia situated on small\r\nprojections on the sides of the filaments, and interlocking with the\r\ncilia of the adjacent filament. The two superposed plates or leaves\r\nof the gill may or may not be united by cords running between the two\r\nparts of a filament. (_Filibranchiata._)\r\n\r\n3. In the _Pectinidae_, _Aviculidae_, and _Ostreidae_ a further\r\ndevelopment takes place. The filaments of each gill are reflected in\r\nthe same way as in the _Filibranchiata_, but the part thus reflected\r\nmay become completely united or ‘concresce’ with the mantle on the\r\nexterior and with the base of the foot on the interior side. The leaves\r\nof each gill plate, which have thus become doubled (the gills being\r\napparently two instead of one on each side), are folded or crumpled,\r\nand the filaments are modified at the re-entrant angles of the fold.\r\n(_Pseudolamellibranchiata._)\r\n\r\n4. In all the remaining _Pelecypoda_, except class 5, in other words,\r\nin the very large majority of families, the filaments are either\r\nreflected, as in (3), or simple; but the process of concrescence is\r\nso far advanced that the adjacent filaments are always intimately\r\nconnected with one another in such a way as to admit the passage of the\r\nblood; and the leaves of each gill-plate (Fig. 76, C) are united by\r\ncross channels in a similar way. (_Eulamellibranchiata._)\r\n\r\n5. In certain of the _Anatinacea_ alone (_Cuspidaria_, _Lyonsiella_,\r\n_Poromya_, _Silenia_) the gills are transformed into a more or less\r\nmuscular partition, extending from one adductor muscle to the other\r\n(Fig. 76, D), and separating off the pallial chamber into two distinct\r\ndivisions, which communicate by means of narrow slits in the partition.\r\n(_Septibranchiata._)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 78.--Transverse section of portion of an\r\n  outer gill plate of _Anodonta_, highly magnified: _il_, inner\r\n  lamella; _il´_, outer lamella; _ilj_, interlamellar junctions;\r\n  _v_, large vertical vessels. (After Peck.)]\r\n\r\nThus the process of gill development in the Pelecypoda appears to lead\r\nup from a simple to a very complex type. In its original form, at all\r\nevents in the most primitive form known to us, the gill is a series of\r\nshort filaments, quite independent of one another, strung in two rows;\r\nthen the filaments become longer and double back, while at the same\r\ntime they begin to show signs of adhesion, as yet only superficial, to\r\none another. In a further stage, the reflected portions become fused to\r\nthe adjacent surfaces of the foot and mantle, while the interlamellar\r\njunctions serve to lock the two gill-plates together; finally, the\r\nmere ciliary junction of adjacent filaments is exchanged for intimate\r\nvascular connection, while the gill-plates as a whole become closely\r\nfused together in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nThis theory of origin is strengthened by closer observation of the\r\nphenomena of a single group. Taking the Septibranchiata as an instance,\r\nwe find that in _Lyonsiella_ the branchiae unite with the mantle\r\nin such a way as to form two large pallial chambers, the structure\r\nof the branchiae being preserved, and their lamellae covering the\r\npartition. A further stage is observed in _Poromya_. There, a similar\r\npartition exists, but it has become muscular, preserving, however, on\r\neach side two groups of branchial lamellae, separated one from the\r\nother by a series of slits, which form a communication between the\r\ntwo pallial chambers. A further stage still is seen in _Silenia_.\r\nThere the same muscular partition exists, but the branchial lamellae\r\non either side have disappeared, the slits between the two chambers,\r\nwhich occur in _Poromya_, still persisting, but separated into three\r\ngroups. _Cuspidaria_ represents the last stage in the development. In\r\nthe ventral chamber there appears nothing at all corresponding to a\r\nbranchia; the surface of the partition appears perfectly uniform, but\r\non careful examination three little separate orifices, remains of the\r\nthree groups of orifices in _Silenia_, are observed.[276]\r\n\r\n_Relation between Branchiae and Heart._--The object of the branchiae\r\nbeing, as has been already stated, to aerate the blood on its way to\r\nthe heart, we find that the heart and the branchiae stand in very\r\nimportant structural relations to one another. When the branchiae\r\nare in pairs, we find that the auricles of the heart are also\r\npaired, the auricle on the right and left sides being supplied by\r\nthe right and left branchiae respectively. This is the case with the\r\nDibranchiate Cephalopods (_Argonauta_, _Octopus_, _Loligo_, etc.),\r\nthe Zygobranchiate Prosobranchs (_Fissurella_, _Haliotis_), and all\r\n_Pelecypoda_. In the _Amphineura_ (_Chiton_, etc.) there are two\r\nauricles corresponding to the two sets of multiple branchiae. In the\r\ncase of the Tetrabranchiate Cephalopods (_Nautilus_) there are four\r\nauricles corresponding to each of the four branchiae. Compare Fig. 79,\r\nA, B, C, D, E.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when the branchia is single, or when both branchiae\r\nare on the same side, and one is aborted and functionless, the auricle\r\nis single too, and on the same side as the branchia. This is the case\r\nwith the Tectibranchiate Opisthobranchs (_Philine_, _Scaphander_,\r\netc.), all the Pectinibranchiate Prosobranchs (Rachiglossa,\r\nTaenioglossa, and Ptenoglossa), and the other Azygobranchiate\r\nProsobranchs (Trochidae, Neritidae, etc.). In the last case the right\r\nauricle exists, as well as the left, but is simply a closed sac, the\r\ncoalescing of the two gills on the left side having thrown all the work\r\nupon the left auricle. Compare Fig. 79, F, G, H.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 79.--Diagram illustrating the relations\r\n  between branchiae, heart, and aorta in the Mollusca: =A=, In\r\n  Chiton; =B=, Pelecypoda; =C=, Dibranchiate Cephalopoda; =D=,\r\n  Tetrabranchiate Cephalopoda; =E=, Prosobranchiata Zygobranchiata;\r\n  =F=, Prosobranchiata Azygobranchiata; =G=, Prosobranchiata\r\n  Monotocardia; =H=, Opisthobranchiata Tectibranchiata: 1,\r\n  Ventricle; 2, Auricle; 3, Aorta; 3_a_, Cephalic aorta; 3_b_,\r\n  Visceral aorta; 3_c_, Posterior aorta. (From A. Lang.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Circulatory System=\r\n\r\nAll Mollusca, without exception, possess a circulatory system of more\r\nor less complexity. The centre of the system is the heart, which\r\nreceives the aerated blood from the breathing organs, and propels it to\r\nevery part of the body. In the Scaphopoda alone there appears to be no\r\ndistinct heart.\r\n\r\nThe heart may consist simply of a single auricle and ventricle, and\r\nan aorta opening out of the ventricle. From the aorta the blood is\r\nconveyed to the various parts of the body by arteries. Veins convey the\r\nblood back to the breathing organs, after passing over which it returns\r\nby the branchial or pulmonary vein to the heart, thus completing the\r\ncircuit.\r\n\r\nAs regards position, the heart is situated within the pericardium,\r\na separate chamber which in the Pelecypoda, Cephalopoda, and the\r\nbilaterally symmetrical Gasteropoda lies on the median line, while in\r\nthe asymmetrical Gasteropoda it is on one or other of the sides of the\r\nbody, usually the right. The veins connected with the branchiae, and\r\nconsequently the auricle into which they open, are situated _behind_\r\nthe ventricle in the Opisthobranchiata (whence their name), while in\r\nthe Prosobranchiata they are situated _in front of_ the ventricle.\r\n\r\nThe number of auricles corresponds to the number of branchiae. Thus\r\nthere is only one auricle in the great majority of Prosobranchiata\r\n(which are accordingly classified as _Monotocardia_), and also in\r\nthe Opisthobranchiata, while the Pulmonata have a single auricle\r\ncorresponding to the pulmonary chamber. There are two auricles in\r\nthe Amphineura, in a small group of Gasteropoda, hence known as\r\n_Diotocardia_, in all Pelecypoda, and in the Dibranchiate Cephalopoda.\r\nIn the Tetrabranchiate Cephalopoda alone there are four auricles\r\ncorresponding to the four branchiae.\r\n\r\nA single aorta occurs only in the Amphineura and in the Tetrabranchiate\r\nCephalopoda. In all the other groups there are two aortae, leading\r\nout of the anterior and posterior ends of the ventricle in Pelecypoda\r\nand Dibranchiate Cephalopoda, while a single aorta leads out of the\r\nposterior end alone, and subsequently bifurcates, in most of the\r\nGasteropoda. One aorta, the cephalic, supplies the front part of the\r\nbody, the oesophagus, stomach, mantle, etc.; the other, the visceral\r\naorta, supplies the posterior part, the liver and sexual organs.\r\n\r\nThe general circulatory system in the Mollusca has not yet been\r\nthoroughly investigated. As a general rule, the blood driven from the\r\nventricle through the aorta into the arteries, passes, on reaching\r\nthe alimentary canal and other adjacent organs, into a number of\r\nirregular spaces called _lacunae_. These in their turn branch into\r\n_sinuses_, or narrow tubes covered with muscular tissue, which\r\npenetrate the body in every direction. In the Dibranchiate Cephalopoda\r\ntrue capillaries are said to occur, which in some cases form a direct\r\ncommunication between the arteries and veins. According to some\r\nauthorities[277] capillaries and veins exist in certain Pelecypoda in\r\nconnexion with the intestinal lacunae, but this again is regarded by\r\nothers as not established. A similar difference of opinion occurs with\r\nregard to the precise function of the foot-pore which occurs in many\r\nMollusca, some holding that it serves as a means for the introduction\r\nof water into the blood-vascular system, while others regard it as a\r\nform of secretion gland, the original purpose of which has perhaps\r\nbecome lost.\r\n\r\n=Blood.=--As a rule, the blood of the Mollusca--_i.e._ not the\r\ncorpuscles but the liquor sanguinis--is colourless, or slightly tinged\r\nwith blue on exposure to the air. This is due to the presence of a\r\npigment termed _haemocyanin_, in which are found traces of copper and\r\niron, the former predominating. _Haemoglobin_, the colouring matter\r\nof the blood in Vertebrates, is, according to Lankester,[278] of very\r\nrestricted occurrence. It is found--(1) in special corpuscles in the\r\nblood of _Solen legumen_ (and _Arca Noae_); (2) in the general blood\r\nsystem of _Planorbis_; (3) in the muscles of the pharynx and jaws\r\nof certain Gasteropoda, _e.g._ _Limnaea_, _Paludina_, _Littorina_,\r\n_Chiton_, _Aplysia_. This distribution of haemoglobin is explained by\r\nLankester in reference to its chemical activity; whenever increased\r\nfacilities for oxidisation are required, then it may be present to\r\ndo the work. The Mollusca, being as a rule otiose, do not possess it\r\ngenerally diffused in the blood, as do the Vertebrata. The actively\r\nburrowing _Solen_ possesses it, and perhaps its presence in _Planorbis_\r\nis to be explained from its respiring the air of stagnant marshes.\r\nIts occurrence in the pharyngeal muscles and jaws of other genera may\r\nbe due to the constant state of activity in which these organs are\r\nkept.[279]\r\n\r\nAccording to Tenison-Woods[280] a species of _Arca_ (_trapezia_ Desh.)\r\nand two species of _Solen_, all Australian, have red blood. It is\r\nsuggested that in these cases the habits of the animal (the _Solen_\r\nburrowing deeply in sand, the _Arca_ in mud) require some highly\r\noxidising element, surrounded as the creature is by ooze. In _Arca\r\npexata_ (N. America) the blood is red, the animal being familiarly\r\nknown as the ‘bloody clam.’ Burrowing species, however, are not all\r\ndistinguished by this peculiarity. Tenison-Woods finds red fluids in\r\nthe buccal mass of many Gasteropoda, _e.g._ in species of _Patella_,\r\n_Acmaea_, _Littorina_, _Trochus_, _Turbo_, giving the parts the\r\nappearance of raw meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =The Mantle=\r\n\r\nOn the dorsal side of the typical molluscan body, between the visceral\r\nsac and the shell, lies a duplicature of the integument, generally\r\nknown as the _mantle_. The depending sides of the mantle, which are\r\nusually somewhat thickened, enclose between themselves and the body\r\nmass a chamber of varying size and shape, called the _mantle cavity_,\r\nwhich communicates freely with the external air or water, and encloses\r\nand furnishes a protection for the organ or organs of respiration. On\r\nits upper or dorsal surface the mantle is closely applied to the shell\r\nthroughout its whole extent, the cells with which it is furnished\r\nsecreting the materials from which the shell is formed (see p. 255).\r\nThe whole mantle is capable, to some degree, of secreting shelly\r\nmatter, but the most active agent in its production is the mantle edge\r\nor margin.\r\n\r\nIn the Prosobranchiata the mantle cavity, for reasons which have\r\nalready been explained, is found on the left side of the animal, its\r\nfront portion being in many cases produced into a tubular siphon.\r\nWithin the mantle cavity are found, besides the branchia, the anus,\r\nthe apertures of the kidneys, and the osphradium. In the pulmonata the\r\nmantle fold encloses a so-called lung-cavity. The front edge of the\r\nmantle coalesces with the integument of the neck in such a way as to\r\nenclose the cavity very completely, the only communication with the\r\nouter air being by means of the contractile breathing or pulmonary\r\naperture on the right side. In the Tectibranchiate Opisthobranchs the\r\nmantle fold is inconsiderable, and is usually not of sufficient extent\r\nto cover the branchia, while in the Nudibranchs, which have no true\r\nbranchiae, it disappears altogether.\r\n\r\nIn the Pelecypoda the mantle cavity is equally developed on each side,\r\nenclosing the two sets of branchiae. The mantle may thus be regarded as\r\nconsisting of two equal portions, which form a sort of lining to the\r\ntwo valves. The lower or ventral portion of the mantle edges may be\r\nsimple, or provided with ocelli (_Pecten_, _Arca_), tentacles, cilia\r\n(_Lima_, _Lepton_), or doubled folds. The two portions of the mantle\r\ntouch one another along the whole line of the edge of the two valves,\r\nand, although thus in contact, may remain completely separate from one\r\nanother, or else become permanently united at one or more points. This\r\nfusion of the mantle edges corresponds to important changes in the\r\norganisation of the animal as a whole. The anal and branchial siphons\r\nare no more than prolongations of the mantle edges on the posterior\r\nside into a tubular form. These ‘siphons’ exhibit the siphonal form\r\nmore distinctly according as the adjacent portions of the mantle become\r\nmore definitely fused together.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 80.--Diagram illustrating the various\r\n  stages in the closing of the mantle in Pelecypoda: =A=, mantle\r\n  completely open; =B=, rudiments of siphons, mantle still\r\n  completely open; =C=, mantle closed at one point; =D=, mantle\r\n  closed at two points, with complete formation of siphonal\r\n  apertures; =E=, development of siphons, ventral closure more\r\n  extended; =F=, mantle closed at three points, with fourth\r\n  orifice: _f_, foot; _s.a_, _s.b_, anal and branchial siphons;\r\n  1, 2, 3, first, second, and third points of closure of mantle.\r\n  (After A. Lang.)]\r\n\r\nThis progressive fusion of the mantle edges may be taken as indicating\r\ndefinite stages in the development of the Pelecypoda. A perfectly free\r\nmantle edge, joined at no point with the edge of the adjacent mantle,\r\noccurs in _Nucula_, _Arca_, _Anomia_, and _Trigonia_ (see Fig. 80,\r\nA, B). Here there is nothing in the nature of a siphon, either anal\r\nor branchial; in other words, no contrivance exists to prevent the\r\nspent water which has passed over the branchiae from becoming mixed\r\nwith the fresh water which is to reach them. When the mantle edges\r\nare fused at _one point only_, this is invariably on the middle part\r\nof the posterior side, thus separating off an anal opening which may\r\nbecome prolonged into a tube-like form. At the same time the adjacent\r\nunderlying portions of the mantle edges draw together, without actually\r\ncoalescing, to form an opening for the incurrent stream of water,\r\nthe rudiments of the ‘branchial siphon’ (Fig. 80, C). This is the\r\ncase with most _Mytilidae_ (see Fig. 75) with _Cardita_, _Astarte_,\r\nand _Pisidium_. In the next stage the branchial opening is separated\r\noff by the concrescence of the mantle edges beneath it, and we have\r\nthe mantle united _in two places_, thus forming three openings, the\r\nventral of which is the opening for the protrusion of the foot (Fig.\r\n80, D). This is the case in _Yoldia_, _Leda_, the majority of the\r\nEulamellibranchiata (_e.g._ _Lucina_, _Cyrena_, _Donax_, _Psammobia_,\r\n_Tellina_, _Venus_, _Cardium_, _Mactra_), and all Septibranchiata.\r\nIn _Chama_ and _Tridacna_ the fused portions of the mantle become\r\nmore extended, and in _Pholas_, _Xylophaga_, _Teredo_, _Pandora_, and\r\n_Lyonsia_ this concrescence takes place over the greater length of the\r\nwhole mantle edge, so that the mantle may be regarded as closed, with\r\nthe exception of the three apertures for the foot and the two siphons\r\n(Fig. 80, E).\r\n\r\nIn certain genera there occurs, besides these three apertures, a\r\nfourth, in the line of junction between the pedal and branchial\r\norifices. It appears probable that this fourth orifice (which has been\r\nregarded by some as an inlet for water when the siphons are retracted),\r\nstands in relation to the byssal apparatus (Fig. 80, F). In _Lyonsia_,\r\nfor instance, a thick byssus protrudes through the orifice, which is\r\nlarge and open. In _Solen_, _Lutraria_, _Glycimeris_, _Cochlodesma_,\r\n_Thracia_, _Aspergillum_, and a few more genera, which have no byssus,\r\nthe orifice is very small and narrow. It is possible that in these\r\nlatter cases, the byssal apparatus having become atrophied, the orifice\r\nhas been correspondingly reduced in size.[281]\r\n\r\n=Mantle Reflected over the Shell.=--It is sometimes the case that the\r\nmantle edges tend to double back over the external surface of the\r\nshell, and to enclose it to a greater or less extent. When this process\r\nis carried to an extreme, the edges of the reflected mantle unite, and\r\nthe shell becomes completely internal. We see an incipient stage of\r\nthis process in _Cypraea_ and _Marginella_, where the bright polish\r\non the surface of the shell is due to the protection afforded by the\r\nlobes of the mantle. A considerable portion of the shell of _Scutus_\r\nis concealed in a similar way, while in _Cryptochiton_, _Lamellaria_,\r\nand _Aplysia_ the shell is more or less completely enclosed. Among\r\nPulmonata, it is possible that in forms like _Vitrina_, _Parmacella_,\r\n_Limax_, and _Arion_, we have successive stages in a process which\r\nstarts with a shell completely external, as in _Helix_, and ends, not\r\nmerely by enveloping the shell in the mantle, but by effecting its\r\ndisappearance altogether. In _Vitrina_ and some allied genera we\r\nhave a type in which the mantle lobes are partly reflected over the\r\nshell, which at the same time exhibits rather less of a spiral form\r\nthan in _Helix_. In the stage represented by _Parmacella_, the mantle\r\nedges have coalesced over the whole of the shell, except for a small\r\naperture immediately over the spire; the nucleus alone of the shell\r\nis spiral, the rest considerably flattened. In _Limax_ the shell has\r\nbecome completely internal, and is simply a flat and very thin plate,\r\nthe spiral form being entirely lost, and the nucleus represented by a\r\nsimple thickening at one end of the plate. In _Arion_, the final stage,\r\nwe find that the shell, being no longer needed as a protection to the\r\nvital organs, has either become resolved into a number of independent\r\ngranules, or else has entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nSome indications of a similar series of changes occur in the\r\nPelecypoda. The mantle edge of _Lepton_ is prolonged beyond the area\r\nof the valves, terminating in some cases in a number of filaments. In\r\n_Galeomma_ and _Scintilla_ the valves are partially concealed by the\r\nreflected mantle lobes, and in a remarkable form recently discovered\r\nby Dall[282] (_Chlamydoconcha_) the shell is completely imbedded in\r\nthe mantle, which is perforated at the anterior end by an orifice for\r\nthe mouth, and at the posterior end by a similar orifice for the anus.\r\nIn all these cases, except _Lepton_, it is interesting to notice that\r\nthe hinge teeth have completely disappeared, the additional closing\r\npower gained by the external mantle rendering the work done by a hinge\r\nunnecessary. It is quite possible, on the analogy of the Gasteropoda\r\nmentioned above, and also, it may be added, of the Cephalopoda and\r\nother groups, that we have here indicated the eventual occurrence of a\r\ntype of Pelecypoda altogether deprived of valves, a greatly thickened\r\nmantle performing the part of a shell.[283]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following works will be found useful for further study of this\r\nportion of the subject:--\r\n\r\n   =F.

Nearly all Gasteropoda are\r\nfurnished with at least two cephalic tentacles, projecting like horns\r\nfrom each side of the fore part of the head. At or near the base of\r\nthese are generally situated the eyes. In the Helicidae the eyes are\r\nsituated, not at the base, but at the apex of the tentacles, and in\r\nthat case--except in _Vertigo_--a second pair of shorter tentacles\r\nappears beneath the longer pair. It frequently happens that several\r\nsenses are centred in a single organ; thus the upper tentacles of\r\nsnails not only carry the eyes and serve to a certain extent as tactile\r\norgans, but they also carry the organs of smell.\r\n\r\nThe edges of the mantle, which are sometimes specialised into lobes,\r\nappear to be keenly sensitive to touch in all Gasteropoda.\r\n\r\nIn _Cypraea_ (Fig. 81) these lobes, or tentaculae, are a prominent\r\nfeature of the animal, and also in certain genera of the Trochidae\r\n(Fig. 82). In most of the carnivorous land Pulmonata--_e.g._\r\n_Testacella_, _Rhytida_, _Ennea_--there are developed, under the lower\r\npair of tentacles, and close to the mouth, large labial palps or\r\nfeelers. These are connected with the cerebral ganglion by a very large\r\nnerve, and may therefore be supposed to be of extreme sensitiveness.\r\nIn some of the large carnivorous forms (_Glandina_, _Aerope_, compare\r\nFig. 21, p. 54) these palpae are of great size, and curl upwards like\r\nan enormous pair of moustaches. When a _Glandina_ seizes its prey, the\r\npalpae (see Fig. 83) appear to enfold it and draw it in towards the\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 81.--_Cypraea moneta_ L., showing tentaculae\r\n  at edge of mantle, which partly envelops the shell: =Si=, siphon;\r\n  =M=, =M=, mantle; =F=, foot; =T´=, tentaculae at edge of mantle.\r\n  (After Quoy and Gaimard.) × 3/2.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 82.--_Monodonta canalifera_ Lam., New\r\n  Ireland, showing mantle lobes. (After Quoy and Gaimard.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 83.--_Glandina_ seizing its prey, with buccal\r\n  papillae turned back. (Strebel.)]\r\n\r\nIt is in the Opisthobranchiata that the organs of touch attain their\r\nmaximum development. Many of this group are shell-less or possess a\r\nsmall internal shell, and accordingly, in the absence of this special\r\nform of defence, a multiplied sense of touch is probably of great\r\nservice. Thus we find, besides the ordinary cephalic tentacles,\r\nclusters or crowns of the same above the head of many Nudibranchiata,\r\nwith lobe-like prolongations of the integument, and tentacular\r\nprocesses in the neighbourhood of, or surrounding the branchiae (see\r\nFigs. 58 and 84), or even projecting from the whole upper surface of\r\nthe body (Fig. 5, C).\r\n\r\nIn the Pelecypoda, the chief organs of touch are the foot, which is\r\nalways remarkably sensitive, especially towards its point, the labial\r\npalps on each side of the mouth, and the siphons. In certain cases the\r\nmantle border is prolonged into a series of threads or filaments. These\r\nare particularly noticeable in _Pecten_, _Lepton_, and _Lima_ (Fig.\r\n85), the mantle lobes of the common _L. hians_ of our own coasts being\r\nvery numerous, and of a bright orange colour. In many genera--_e.g._\r\n_Unio_, _Mactra_--this sensibility to touch appears to be shared\r\nby the whole mantle border, although it is not furnished with any\r\nspecial fringing. The ‘arms’ of the Cephalopoda appear to be keenly\r\nsensitive to touch, and this is particularly the case with the front\r\nor tentacular pair of arms, which seem to be employed in an especial\r\ndegree for exploration and investigation of strange objects.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 84.--_Idalia Leachii_ A. and H., British\r\n  seas; _br_, branchiae. (After Alder and Hancock.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 85.--_Lima squamosa_ Lam., Naples, showing\r\n  tentacular lobes of mantle (_t_, _t_); _a_, anus; _ad.m_,\r\n  adductor muscle; _br_, _br_, branchiae; _f_, foot; _sh_, shell.]\r\n\r\n=Taste.=--The sense of taste is no doubt present, to a greater or less\r\nextent, in all the head-bearing Mollusca. In many of these a special\r\nnerve or nerves has been discovered in the pharynx, connecting with the\r\ncerebral ganglion; this no doubt indicates the seat of the faculty of\r\ntaste. The Mollusca vary greatly in their likings for different kinds\r\nof food. Some seem to prefer decaying and highly odoriferous animal\r\nmatter (_Buccinum_, _Nassa_), others apparently confine themselves to\r\nfresh meat (_Purpura_, _Natica_, _Testacella_), others again, although\r\nnaturally vegetarian, will not refuse flesh on occasion (_Limax_,\r\n_Helix_).\r\n\r\nMr. W. A. Gain[284] has made some interesting experiments on the taste\r\nof British land Mollusca, as evidenced by the acceptance or rejection\r\nof various kinds of food. He kept twelve species of _Arion_ and\r\n_Limax_, and eight species of _Helix_ in captivity for many months, and\r\ntried them with no less than 197 different kinds of food, cannibalism\r\nincluded. Some curious points came out in his table of results.\r\n_Amalia gagates_ appears to be surprisingly omnivorous, for out of 197\r\nkinds of food it ate all but 25; _Arion ater_ came next, eating all but\r\n40. _Limax arborum_, on the other hand, was dainty to a fault, eating\r\nonly seven kinds of food, and actually refusing Swedes, which every\r\nother species took with some avidity. Certain food was rejected by all\r\nalike, _e.g._ London Pride, Dog Rose, Beech and Chestnut leaves, Spruce\r\nFir, Common Rush, Liverwort, and Lichens; while all, or nearly all, ate\r\ngreedily of Potatoes, Turnips, Swedes, Lettuces, Leeks, Strawberries,\r\n_Boletus edulis_, and common grasses. Few of our common weeds or\r\nhedgerow flowers were altogether rejected. _Arion_ and _Limax_ were\r\ndecidedly less particular in their food than _Helix_, nearly all of\r\nthem eating earthworms and puff-balls, which no _Helix_ would touch.\r\n_Arion ater_ and _Limax maximus_ ate the slime off one another, and\r\nportions of skin. _Cyclostoma elegans_ and _Hyalinia nitida_ preferred\r\nmoist dead leaves to anything else.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              II. _Sight_\r\n\r\n=Position of Eyes.=--In the majority of the head-bearing Mollusca\r\nthe eyes are two in number, and are placed on, or in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the head. Sometimes they are carried on projecting\r\ntentacles or ‘ommatophores,’ which are either simple (as in\r\nProsobranchiata) or capable of retraction like the fingers of a\r\nglove (_Helix_, etc.). Sometimes, as in a large number of the marine\r\nGasteropoda, the eyes are at the outer base of the cephalic tentacles,\r\nor are mounted on the tentacles themselves, but never at the tip\r\n(compare Fig. 60, p. 153 and Fig. 98, p. 199). In other cases they are\r\nplaced somewhat farther back, at the sides of the neck. The Pulmonata\r\nare usually subdivided into two great groups, _Stylommatophora_ and\r\n_Basommatophora_ (Fig. 86), according as the eyes are carried on the\r\ntip of the large tentacles (_Helix_, and all non-operculate land\r\nshells), or placed at the inner side of their base (_Limnaea_, _Physa_,\r\netc.). In land and fresh-water operculates, the eyes are situated at\r\nthe outer base of the tentacles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 86.--=A=, _Limnaea peregra_ Müll.; _e_, _e_,\r\n  eyes; _t_, _t_, tentacles; =B=, _Helix nemoralis_ Müll.; _e_,\r\n  _e_, eyes; _t_, _t_, tentacles; _p.o_, pulmonary orifice.]\r\n\r\nIn the Helicidae, careful observation will show that the eyes are not\r\nplaced exactly in the centre of the end of the tentacle, but on its\r\nupper side, inclining slightly outwards. The eye is probably pushed on\r\none side, as it were, by the development of the neighbouring olfactory\r\nbulb. The sense of smell being far more important to these animals than\r\nthe sense of sight, the former sense develops at the expense of the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n=Organisation of the Molluscan Eye.=--The eye in Mollusca exhibits\r\nalmost every imaginable form, from the extremely simple to the\r\nelaborately complex. It may be, as in certain bivalves, no more than\r\na pigmented spot on the mantle, or it may consist, as in some of the\r\nCephalopoda, of a cornea, a sclerotic, a choroid, an iris, a lens, an\r\naqueous and vitreous humour, a retina, and an optic nerve, or of some\r\nof these parts only.\r\n\r\nIn most land and fresh-water Mollusca the eye may be regarded, roughly\r\nspeaking, as a ball connected by an exceedingly fine thread (the optic\r\nnerve) with a nerve centre (the cerebral ganglion). In _Paludina_\r\nthis ball is elliptic, in _Planorbis_ and _Neritina_ it is drawn out\r\nat the back into a conical or pear shape. In _Helix_ (Fig. 87) there\r\nis a structureless membrane, surrounding the whole eye, a lens, and a\r\nretina, the latter consisting of a nervous layer, a cellular layer, and\r\na layer of rods containing pigment, this innermost layer (that nearest\r\nthe lens) being of the thickness of half the whole retina.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 87.--Eye of _Helix pomatia_ L., retracted\r\n  within the tentacle; _c_, cornea; _ep_, epithelial layer; _l_,\r\n  lens; _op.n_, optic nerve; _r_, retina. (After Simroth.)]\r\n\r\nComparing the eyes of different Gasteropoda together, we find that\r\nthey represent stages in a general course of development. Thus in\r\n_Patella_ the eye is scarcely more than an invagination or depression\r\nin the integument, which is lined with pigmented and retinal cells.\r\nThe next upward stage occurs in _Trochus_, where the depression\r\nbecomes deeper and bladder-shaped, and is filled with a gelatinous or\r\ncrystalline mass, but still is open at the top, and therefore permits\r\nthe eye to be bathed in water. Then, as in _Turbo_, the bladder becomes\r\nclosed by a thin epithelial layer, which finally, as in some _Murex_,\r\nbecomes much thicker, while the ‘eyeball’ encloses a lens (Fig. 88),\r\nwhich probably corresponds with the ‘vitreous humour’ of other types.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 88.--Eyes of Gasteropoda, showing arrest of\r\n  development at successive stages: =A=, _Patella_; =B=, _Trochus_;\r\n  =C=, _Turbo_; =D=, _Murex_; _ep_, epidermis; _l_, lens; _op.n_,\r\n  optic nerve; _r_, retina; _v.h_, vitreous humour. (After Hilger.)]\r\n\r\nIn _Nautilus_ the eye is of a very simple type. It consists of a\r\ncup-shaped depression, with a small opening which is not quite closed\r\nby the integument. The retina consists of cells which line the\r\ninterior of the depression, and which communicate directly with the\r\nbranches of the optic nerve, there being no iris or lens. This type of\r\neye, it will be observed, corresponds exactly with that which occurs in\r\n_Patella_. It appears also to correspond to a stage in the development\r\nof eyes in the Dibranchiata (_e.g._ _Octopus_, _Sepia_, _Loligo_).\r\nLankester has shown[285] that in _Loligo_ the eye first appears as a\r\nridge, enclosing an oval area in the integument. By degrees the walls\r\nof this area close in, and eventually join, enclosing the retinal cells\r\nwithin the chamber in which the lens is afterwards developed (Fig.\r\n89). It thus appears that in some cases the development of the eye is\r\narrested at a point which in other cases only forms a temporary stage\r\ntowards a higher type of organisation.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 89.--Three stages in the development of the\r\n  eye of _Loligo_; _r_, _r_, ridge, enclosing _p.o.c_, primitive\r\n  optic chamber; _or_, orifice between the closing ridges;\r\n  _s.o.c_, secondary optic chamber; _ci_, _ci_, ciliary body; _l_,\r\n  rudimentary lens; _R_, retina. (After Lankester.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 90.--Eye in =A=, _Loligo_; =B=, _Helix_ or\r\n  _Limax_; =C=, _Nautilus_: _a.o.c_, anterior optic chamber; _c_,\r\n  cornea; _int_, integument; _ir_, iris; _l_, lens; _l´_, external\r\n  portion of lens; _op.n_, optic nerve; _op.g_, optic ganglion;\r\n  _p.o.c_, posterior optic chamber; _r_, retina. (After Grenacher.)]\r\n\r\nThe developed eye in the dibranchiate Cephalopods consists of a\r\ntransparent cornea, which may or may not be closed over the front of\r\nthe lens. Behind the cornea is a narrow chamber (the anterior optic\r\nchamber) which is continued for three parts round the whole circle\r\nof the eye, and into which project the front portion of the lens and\r\nthe folds of the iris. Throughout its whole extent, the anterior optic\r\nchamber is lined by the integument, the portion of which on the inner\r\nside is the choroid. The lens is divided into an outer and inner\r\nsegment by a thin membrane, and is supported by the ciliary body which\r\nforms a continuation of the retina. The main portion of the lens lies\r\nwithin the posterior optic chamber, at the back and sides of which is\r\nfound the retina (Grenacher).\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the Cephalopoda use their eyes to observe,\r\nbut there is nothing to show that any other Mollusca use their eyes\r\nfor this purpose, the sense of smell in their case largely taking the\r\nplace of visual observation. Madame Jeannette Power once saw[286]\r\nthe _Octopus_ in her aquarium holding a fragment of rock in one of\r\nits arms, and watching a _Pinna_ which was opening its valves. As\r\nsoon as they were perfectly open, the Poulpe, with incredible address\r\nand promptitude, placed the stone between the valves, preventing\r\nthe _Pinna_ from closing again, upon which it set about devouring\r\nits victim. The next day the Poulpe was seen, after crushing some\r\n_Tellina_, to stretch himself down close by a _Triton nodiferus_, and\r\nwatch it attentively. After four hours the _Triton_ emerged from its\r\nshell, when the _Octopus_ sprang upon it, and surrounded it with its\r\narms.\r\n\r\n=Powers of Vision in Land Mollusca.=--The Helicidae are undoubtedly\r\nvery short-sighted. Seldom emerging from their retreats except in\r\ntwilight and darkness, they are naturally myopic, and see better in a\r\nsubdued than in a bright light. Experiment has shown that a _Helix_ can\r\nperceive an object better at 6 centimetres distance in a weak light\r\nthan at 4 or 5 millimetres in a strong one. _Cyclostoma elegans_ and\r\n_Paludina vivipara_ are comparatively long-sighted, perceiving objects\r\nat a distance of 20 to 30 centimetres.[287] The increased power of\r\nvision is due, in these two cases, to increased elaboration in the\r\nconstruction of the eye, _Paludina_ possessing a large and almost\r\nspherical lens, to which the vitreous humour closely adheres, while in\r\n_Cyclostoma_ the lens is remarkably hard, and the aqueous humour very\r\nabundant. According to V. Willem,[288] the Pulmonata are very sensitive\r\nto the slightest movement of the air or jarring of the surface on which\r\nthey crawl, but are so short-sighted as only to perceive a confused\r\nimage of a large object at about 1 cm., and to distinguish the form of\r\nobjects at not more than 1 or 2 mm. The senses of touch and smell are\r\nfar more active than that of sight. A bean-pod enclosed in a narrow\r\nglass case and placed before a hungry snail was not noticed, but when\r\ntaken out of the case and placed 8 cm. behind the snail, the latter at\r\nonce turned towards it to devour it.\r\n\r\nSome interesting experiments were conducted by the same author with the\r\nview of ascertaining whether snails avoid or court the light. He placed\r\na number of species in different wooden boxes, which were divided into\r\na light and a dark compartment, having previously well soaked the boxes\r\nin water to secure a humid atmosphere and surface, and so induce the\r\nsnails to move about. The result showed that nearly all species have a\r\nmarked predilection one way or the other, but not all in the same way.\r\n_Helix aspersa_, _Arion empiricorum_, six species of _Limax_, and three\r\nof _Planorbis_, are lovers of darkness, while _H. nemoralis_, _Succinea\r\nputris_, and two species of _Limnaea_ are lovers of light. _Physa\r\nfontinalis_ stands alone in being quite indifferent.\r\n\r\nM. Willem endeavoured further to discover whether any of the Mollusca\r\npossessed ‘dermatoptic perception,’ or the faculty of perceiving\r\nvariation of light by means of the skin alone. He accordingly repeated\r\nthe above-mentioned experiments, having previously extirpated the\r\neyes in all cases. The result was remarkable. In a few instances the\r\nexperiment was not conclusive, but _H. aspersa_, _A. empiricorum_,\r\nseveral species of _Limax_, and one _Limnaea_ shunned or sought the\r\nlight just as they had done when their eyes were present. A few marine\r\nMollusca (_Littorina littorea_, _Trochus cinerarius_, _T. umbilicatus_,\r\n_Patella vulgata_) were also shown to be exceedingly sensitive to the\r\nimpact of a shadow, whether with or without their eyes.\r\n\r\n=Blind and Eyeless Mollusca.=--In a large number of marine Mollusca\r\nwhich habitually creep about half buried in wet sand (_Bullia_,\r\n_Sigaretus_, _Scaphander_, _Philine_), eyes are altogether absent. In\r\nsome species of _Natica_ and _Sigaretus_, and in _Doris_, eyes are\r\ndeveloped, but are enclosed in a thick layer of skin, through which\r\nthey can probably do little more than faintly appreciate different\r\ndegrees of light and darkness. _Chiton_ has cephalic eyes in the\r\nembryo, but loses them in the adult stage. The two great _Auricula_,\r\n_A. auris Judae_ and _A. auris Midae_, which habitually creep about\r\nin the liquid mud of mangrove swamps, have entirely lost their eyes.\r\nCertain pelagic Mollusca seem to have a tendency, which is not easily\r\nexplained, to lose their eyes or the power of seeing with them. Thus\r\n_Ianthina_ has no eyes at all. Pteropoda as a rule have no eyes,\r\nand the few that have (_Creseis_, _Cavolinia_) possess only certain\r\npigmented spots placed near to the nervous centres. In the Heteropoda,\r\nhowever, and the Cephalopoda, many of which are pelagic, the eyes are\r\nunusually large.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 91.--_Sigaretus laevigatus_ Lam., a species\r\n  frequenting wet sand, and destitute of external eyes: =F=,\r\n  anterior portion of foot. (After Souleyet.)]\r\n\r\n=Eyes in Deep-sea and Underground Mollusca.=--Deep-sea Mollusca, as a\r\nrule, possess no visual organs, or possess them only in a rudimentary\r\nstate, but this rule has its exceptions. Dr. Pelseneer found[289] no\r\ntrace of eyes in two species of _Pleurotoma_ from 1850 and 1950 fath.,\r\nnone in a _Fossarus_ from 1400 f., none in a _Puncturella_ from 1340 f.\r\nA remarkable form of _Voluta_ (_Guivillea_) from 1600 f. possessed eyes\r\nwhich could hardly be functional, as they were destitute of pigment,\r\nand exhibited other changes of structure. On the other hand, it is\r\nremarkable to notice that in three different species of _Trochus_ from\r\n450 f., 565 f., and 1375 f., the eyes were pigmented and well developed.\r\n\r\nIn land Mollusca which live beneath the surface of the ground or in\r\nabsolute darkness, the eyes are generally more or less modified.\r\nThus in _Testacella_, which usually burrows deeply in the soil, but\r\noccasionally emerges into the open air, the eyes are very small, but\r\ndistinct and pigmented. Our little _Caecilianella acicula_, which\r\nis never seen above the surface, is altogether destitute of eyes. A\r\nspecies of _Zospeum_, a _Helix_, and a _Bithynella_ from dark caves\r\nin Carniola have suffered a similar loss. On the other hand, a small\r\n_Hyalinia_ from a dark cave in Utah (probably a recent addition to the\r\ncave fauna) has the eyes normally developed.\r\n\r\n=Eyes of Onchidium.=--Many species of _Onchidium_, a naked land\r\npulmonate which creeps on rocks near high-water mark, are provided\r\nwith dorsal eyes of various degrees of organisation, and in numbers\r\nvarying up to nearly one hundred. The tropical _Onchidium_ are the\r\nprey of a fish (_Periophthalmus_) which skips along the beach by the\r\naid of its large ventral fins, and feeds principally on insects and\r\n_Onchidium_. Karl Semper suggests[290] that the eyes are of service to\r\n_Onchidium_ as enabling it to apprehend the shadow of the approaching\r\n_Periophthalmus_, and defend itself by suddenly contracting certain\r\nglands on the skin and expressing a liquid secretion which flies\r\ninto the air like shot and frightens the _Periophthalmus_ away. This\r\ntheory for it is no more than theory--may or may not be true, but it\r\nis remarkable that _Onchidium_ with dorsal eyes have precisely the\r\nsame geographical distribution as _Periophthalmus_, and that where no\r\n_Periophthalmus_ exists, _e.g._ on our own S.W. coasts, the _Onchidium_\r\nare entirely destitute of dorsal eyes. In those species of _Onchidium_\r\nwhich have no dorsal eyes, the latter are on the tips of the tentacles,\r\nas in _Helix_. The eyes are developed _on_ the head, and afterwards\r\nascend with the growth of the ommatophores, while in _Helix_ the\r\nommatophores are formed first, and the eyes developed upon them.[291]\r\n\r\n=Dorsal Eyes in the Chitonidae.=--The remarkable discoveries of Moseley\r\nwith regard to the dorsal eyes of _Chiton_ were first published in\r\n1884.[292] He happened to notice, while examining a specimen of\r\n_Schizochiton incisus_, a number of minute black dots on the outer\r\nsurface of the shell, which appeared to refract light as if composed\r\nof glass or crystal. These ‘eyes,’ in all the species of _Chiton_ yet\r\nexamined, are restricted to the outer surface of the exposed area of\r\nthe shell, never being on the laminae of insertion or on the girdle.\r\nIn certain sub-genera of _Chiton_ the eyes are scattered irregularly\r\nover the surface, in others they are arranged symmetrically in rows\r\ndiverging from the apex of each plate, but in old specimens the eyes\r\ntowards the apices are generally rubbed off by erosion or abrasion.\r\nMoseley regarded the occurrence of scattered eyes as indicating an\r\noriginal stage of development, when the eyes were at first disposed\r\nirregularly all over the surface of the shell; the gathering into\r\nregular rows showing a later stage.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 92.--Dorsal eyes of _Chitonidae_, showing the\r\n  various forms of arrangement in the first and fourth valves of 1,\r\n  1_a_, _Acanthopleura spinigera_ Sowb., E. Indies, × 2; 2, 2_a_,\r\n  _Tonicia suezensis_ Reeve, Suez, × 3; 3, 3_a_, _Acanthopleura\r\n  granulata_ Gmel., W. Indies, × 2; 4, 4_a_, _Tonicia lineolata_\r\n  Fremb., Chili, × 2. From specimens in the Museum of Zoology,\r\n  Cambridge.]\r\n\r\nThe eyes appear to be invariably more numerous on the anterior plate.\r\nThus in _Corephium aculeatum_ there are about 12,000 in all, of which\r\nmore than 3000 are on the anterior plate. In _Schizochiton_ they are\r\narranged in very symmetrical rows, six of which are situated on the\r\nanterior, and only two, sometimes only one, on the central plates. In\r\n_Tonicia marmorata_ the eyes are sunk in little cup-shaped depressions\r\nof the shell, possibly to escape abrasion. As regards shape and size,\r\nin _Ch. incisus_ they are circular, and about 1/35 inch in diameter,\r\nthis being the largest size known; in _Ch. spiniger_ and _Ch.\r\naculeatus_ they are oval, measuring about 1/400 x 1/600 inch. There are\r\nno eyes in _Chiton_ proper, nor in _Mopalia_, _Maugeria_, _Lorica_,\r\nand _Ischnochiton_.[293] None of our English species appear to possess\r\nthem.[294]\r\n\r\n=Eyes in Bivalve Mollusca.=--Some, possibly most, of the Pelecypoda\r\npossess, in the larval state, true paired eyes at the oral end of the\r\nbody. These become aborted as the animal develops, since that part of\r\nthe body becomes entirely screened from the light by the growth of the\r\nshell. To compensate for their loss, numerous _ocelli_, or pigmented\r\nspots sensitive to the action of light, are in many cases developed\r\non different parts of the mantle, functionally corresponding to the\r\n‘eyes’ of _Chiton_ described above. As in _Chiton_, too, we have here\r\nan interesting series of instances in which true eyes have suffered\r\ntotal obliteration, through disuse, and, as if to restore to the animal\r\nin some measure its lost sense, visual organs of a low power have\r\nsubsequently been developed and are now observed in various stages of\r\nspecialisation.\r\n\r\n=Concentration of Eyes in Special Parts of the Mantle.=--Sharp has\r\nshown[295] that in several species of _Ostrea_, _Cardium_, _Anomia_,\r\n_Lima_, _Avicula_, _Arca_, and _Tellina_ pigmented cells, with a\r\nhighly refractive cuticle, are scattered over a considerable portion\r\nof the mantle. Experiment has proved the powers of ‘vision,’ _i.e._\r\nof sensitiveness to different degrees of light, possessed by these\r\norgans. In _Dreissena polymorpha_, _Tapes decussatus_, and two species\r\nof _Venus_ these cells are concentrated on that particular part of the\r\nmantle which is not always covered by the shell, _i.e._ the siphon,\r\nbut since the siphon can be completely retracted within the shell,\r\nthere is no special provision for their protection. A further step\r\nis shown in the case of _Mya arenaria_, where the siphon is scarcely\r\ncapable of complete retraction. Here, while some of the pigment cells\r\nare scattered about over the surface of the siphon, the majority\r\nare placed in grooves at the base of the siphonal tentacles, forming\r\nan intensely black band round them. A higher stage still is shown in\r\n_Solen vagina_, _S. ensis_, and _Mactra solidissima_, where the cells\r\nare situated only in the siphonal grooves, which are more or less\r\nspecialised in numbers and complexity.\r\n\r\n_Arca Noae_, according to Patten, is very sensitive to any sudden\r\nchange in the amount of light falling upon its mantle-edge. A faint\r\nshadow cast upon it by the hand is sufficient to cause it to close\r\nits valves quickly, but always one or two seconds afterwards, the\r\npromptitude in all cases depending upon the depth of the shadow.\r\nSensitiveness in this direction was found to depend greatly upon\r\nthe vitality of the animals themselves, since it always became less\r\nin those specimens which had been kept for long in confinement. A\r\nshadow was not always necessary to make them close. An ordinary\r\nblack pencil, if approached within two or three inches with extreme\r\ncaution, produced the same result, while a glass rod brought within\r\nthe same distance, and even moved rapidly to and fro, appeared to\r\ncause no alarm. Sensitiveness to change in intensity of light was\r\nexperimentally noticed by the same author in the case of _Ostrea_,\r\n_Mactra_, _Avicula_ (to a special extent), and _Cardium_. It is very\r\nremarkable to find that increased elaboration in the structure of the\r\neyes does not necessarily carry with it increased sensitiveness, _i.e._\r\nhigher visual powers. _Avicula_, which is only provided with a few\r\nscattered ommatidia, which would entirely escape the notice of any one\r\nwho had not seen them better developed elsewhere, was considerably more\r\nsensitive to light and shade than _Arca_, with its eyes of conspicuous\r\nsize and much more perfect organisation, instantly contracting the\r\nmantle upon the impact of a shadow so faint as to be invisible to the\r\nexperimenter.[296]\r\n\r\n=Visual Faculties of Solen and Ostrea.=--The visual power of _Solen_\r\nmay be exemplified by any one who is walking along almost any of our\r\nsandy bays at extreme low-water mark. If the day be warm and sunny,\r\nnumbers of _Solen_ will be seen raising themselves an inch or two out\r\nof their holes; but if you wish to catch them you must approach very\r\ncautiously, and on no account allow your shadow to fall upon them, or\r\nthey will pop down into their burrows in an instant, and it is vain\r\nto attempt to dig them out. ‘How sensitive,’ remarks Mr. W. Anderson\r\nSmith, with reference to oysters,[297] ‘the creatures are to the\r\nlight above them; the shadow [of the boat] as it passes overhead is\r\ninstantaneously noted, and, snap! the lips are firmly closed.’\r\n\r\n=Ocelli of Pecten.=--In _Pecten_ and _Spondylus_ the _ocelli_ are\r\nremarkably large and prominent, shining like precious stones, and are\r\nplaced along the two edges of the mantle so as to receive the light\r\nwhen the shell gapes (Fig. 93). In _Pecten opercularis_, _jacobaeus_,\r\nand _maximus_ their number varies from 80 to 120. In _Spondylus\r\ngaederopus_, a very inequivalve shell, 60 have been counted on the\r\nright or fixed valve, and 90 on the left or upper valve. Each ocellus\r\nis connected, by means of its optic nerve, with the large circumpalleal\r\nnerve, and so with the branchial ganglion. They possess a cornea,\r\nlens, choroidea, and optic nerve, and, according to Hickson,[298] bear\r\na considerable resemblance to the vertebrate type of eye. In spite\r\nof this, the power of vision in these genera does not appear at all\r\nsuperior to that of other Pelecypoda.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 93.--_Pecten opercularis_ L., showing the\r\n  _ocelli_ on the two edges of the mantle.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 94.--Compound eyes (_c.e_) of _Arca barbata_\r\n  L.; _m.l_, mantle fold; _omm_, ommatidia. (After Patten.)]\r\n\r\nAccording to the elaborate investigations of Patten, the ‘eyes’ in\r\n_Arca_ occur upon the middle or ‘ophthalmic’ fold of the mantle-edge,\r\nwhich is thickened at the end to admit of their reception. Along this\r\nis ranged a row of dark brown spots of various sizes, which are larger\r\nat the anterior and posterior ends of the mantle-edge, but smaller and\r\nmore numerous towards the middle. These brown spots, or ‘eyes,’ are\r\nmany of them compound, being made up of the fusion of a number of\r\nommatidia (from 10 to 80) into one large round eye, which is generally\r\nelevated above the surface of the surrounding epithelium. Sometimes\r\nthese eyes themselves tend to fuse together. In one specimen of _Arca\r\nNoae_, 133 of these faceted eyes were counted in one mantle border, and\r\n102 in the other.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the development of these functional\r\neyes, or sensitive spots, in bivalve Mollusca, is due to special\r\nneeds. They appear to be entirely absent in fresh-water bivalves (with\r\nthe exception of _Dreissensia_, which is obviously a marine genus\r\nrecently become fresh-water), while they are most abundant in genera\r\nliving between tide marks (_Solen_, _Mya_, _Mactra_), and most highly\r\nspecialised in a genus that is, for a bivalve, of singularly active\r\nhabits (_Pecten_). Now genera living in sand between tide marks, as\r\nthe three above-mentioned genera are in the habit of doing, and also\r\nprotruding their siphons, and occasionally a considerable portion\r\nof their shells, out of their burrow, are manifestly very much at\r\nthe mercy of their watchful enemies the gulls, and anything which\r\nwould enable them to apprehend the approach of their enemies would be\r\ngreatly to their advantage. Here, perhaps, lies the explanation of the\r\ngreater elaboration of these pigmented spots in littoral genera, as\r\ncompared with those inhabiting deeper water. _Pecten_, again, a genus\r\ndistinguished by great activity, which can ‘fly’ for considerable\r\ndistances in the water by flapping its valves together and expelling\r\nthe water from the apertures at either side of the hinge, may be\r\ngreatly assisted by its ocelli in directing its flight so as to escape\r\nits enemies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             III. _Smell_\r\n\r\nThe sense of smell--touch at a distance, as Moquin-Tandon has called\r\nit--is probably the most important sense which the Mollusca possess,\r\nand is unquestionably far more valuable to them than that of sight.\r\nAny one who has ever enjoyed the fun of hauling up lobster pots\r\nwill recollect that part of the contents was generally a plentiful\r\nsprinkling of _Buccinum_, _Nassa_, and _Natica_, attracted by the smell\r\nof the stinking piece of fish with which the trap was baited. According\r\nto Mr. J. S. Gibbons,[299] _Bullia rhodostoma_ congregates in hundreds\r\non gigantic medusae which are stranded on the sandy bays near the\r\nCape of Good Hope. Dr. J. G. Jeffreys says[300] that quantities of the\r\ncommon _Neptunea antiqua_ “are procured on the Cheshire coast by the\r\nfishermen placing a dead dog on the sands at low-water mark during\r\nspring tides. The bait is then completely covered with stones, which\r\nare piled up like a cairn. On the next turn of the tide the heap of\r\nstones is visited, and the whelks are found on the surface in great\r\nnumbers, having been apparently attracted by the smell of the bait,\r\nbut unable to get at it.” Mr. W. A. Lloyd kept specimens of _Nassa\r\nreticulata_ in a tank in the sand, at the bottom of which they usually\r\nremained buried. If a piece of meat of any kind were drawn over the\r\nsand, the _Nassa_ would appear above the surface in a few minutes.\r\nHalf-picked beef or mutton bones, if placed in the tank, were covered\r\nin a few minutes. In fact, no animal matter, whether living or dead,\r\ncould be introduced without the _Nassa_ smelling it, and coming up to\r\nsee what they could get.[301]\r\n\r\nAny one can experiment for themselves on the olfactory powers of our\r\ncommon snails or slugs. Moquin-Tandon records[302] two interesting\r\ncases, one communicated to him by letter, the other occurring to\r\nhimself. His correspondent, a M. Parenteau, was one day walking along a\r\ndusty high-road, when he noticed, near the middle of the road, an empty\r\nbean-pod and two Arions eating it. Attributing the meeting of feeders\r\nand food to mere chance, he was walking on, when he noticed a second\r\nbean-pod, and, about two yards away from it, a third _Arion_, hurrying\r\nstraight towards it. When the _Arion_ had yet more than a yard to\r\ntraverse, M. Parenteau picked up the bean and put it in his pocket. The\r\n_Arion_ stopped, raised its head, and turned in every direction, waving\r\nits tentacles, but without advancing. M. Parenteau then carried the\r\nbean to the other side of the road, and put it in a small hole behind a\r\npiece of stone. The _Arion_, after a moment’s indecision, started off\r\nstraight for the bean. Again the position of the precious morsel was\r\nchanged, and again the _Arion_ made for it, this time without being\r\nfurther tantalised. M. Moquin-Tandon noticed, one rainy day in the\r\nbotanical gardens at Toulouse, two _Limax maximus_ approaching a rotten\r\napple from different directions. He changed the position of the apple\r\nseveral times, placing it at a sufficient distance, to be sure they\r\ncould not see it, but they always hit it off correctly, after raising\r\ntheir heads and moving their long tentacles in every direction. It then\r\noccurred to him to hold the apple in the air, some centimetres above\r\nthe head of the _Limax_. They perceived where it was, raised their\r\nheads and lengthened their necks, endeavouring to find some solid body\r\non which to climb to their food.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the land Mollusca have the power of exhaling a disagreeable\r\nsmell, _Hyalinia alliaria_ smelling strongly of garlic, and _Stenogyra\r\ndecollata_ of laudanum; but this need not be any argument for the sense\r\nof smell in the creatures themselves.\r\n\r\n=Position of Olfactory Organs in Pulmonata.=--Most authorities are\r\nof opinion that the olfactory organs are situated in the tentacles.\r\nMoquin-Tandon considered that in the Helicidae and Limacidae the sense\r\nof smell is confined to the little knob or elevation at the end of\r\nthe longer tentacles, close to the eye. He found that when he cut off\r\nthese tentacles both in _Limax_ and _Arion_, the creatures were quite\r\nunable to discover the whereabouts even of strongly-scented food. The\r\nsame author believed that in the Basommatophora the sense of smell\r\nwas present in the whole of the tentacle, which is covered with an\r\nexceedingly sensitive ciliated epithelium. Lacaze-Duthiers, however,\r\nplaces the olfactory sense in this group at the outer side of the base\r\nof the tentacles, near to the eyes. Some authorities[303] deny that the\r\nHelicidae have the olfactory organ at the tip of the tentacles, and\r\nlocate it in a pedal gland near the mouth, which contains conspicuous\r\nsensitive cells. A _Helix_ whose tentacles had been removed manifested\r\nits repulsion to the smell of spirits of turpentine, while another\r\n_Helix_, which was unmutilated, did not object to the turpentine being\r\nheld between its tentacles. Altogether, then, the exact position of the\r\nsmell-organ in the Helicidae must be considered as not yet thoroughly\r\ndetermined. Simroth holds that the sense of smell is distributed over\r\nthe whole soft integument, and is especially concentrated in the\r\nfeelers, and in the neighbourhood of the respiratory orifice.[304]\r\n\r\nIn nearly all marine Mollusca yet examined, the organ of smell or\r\n_osphradium_ is in situation intimately connected with the breathing\r\norgans, being generally placed near their base, with the object,\r\napparently, of testing the quality of the water before it passes over\r\nthe branchiae. It consists of a patch of the epithelium, modified in a\r\nspecial manner, and connected by its own nerve with one of the visceral\r\nganglia.\r\n\r\nAn osphradium does not necessarily occur in all genera; for instance,\r\nit has not been detected in _Fissurella_. It is most highly specialised\r\nin the Conidae, and in the carnivorous Gasteropoda generally. In\r\n_Buccinum undatum_, for instance, it is very large indeed, and, from\r\nits plumed form, has sometimes been mistaken for an accessory branchia\r\n(Fig. 95). In _Haliotis_ it is paired, one lying in close proximity to\r\neach of the two branchiae, but in _Turbo_ it is single, corresponding\r\nto the single branchia. In _Chiton_ there is an osphradium at the\r\nbase of each separate gill filament, making a total of twenty or more\r\non each side. Its position in _Physa_ and in _Cyclostoma_ will be\r\nseen by reference to Figs. 103 and 104 (p. 205). In the Pelecypoda\r\nthe osphradia are paired, and lie adjacent to the posterior adductor\r\nmuscle, close to the hinder end of the axis of the branchiae. In the\r\nTetrabranchiate Cephalopoda there are two osphradia, placed between\r\nthe bases of the two pairs of gills. In the Dibranchiates on the other\r\nhand, a groove above the eyes has been regarded as the seat of the\r\norgan of smell. This groove contains sensory and ciliated cells, and\r\nappears to be connected with a special nerve centre of its own, which\r\nultimately is derived from the cerebral ganglion.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 95.--_Buccinum undatum_ L., deprived of its\r\n  shell, showing the relative position of branchia (_br_) and\r\n  osphradium (_os_); _m_, mucous glands; _s_, siphon. The portion\r\n  of the mantle covering the osphradium has been removed.]\r\n\r\nScarcely any instances of the exercise of the sense of smell on the\r\npart of bivalve Mollusca have been recorded. Something of the sort,\r\nhowever, seems to have been present in a case related by Mr. R. L.\r\nKing.[305] A skull of a fox had been placed in a small ditch in order\r\nto soak, and after a few days, when taken out, was found to be covered\r\nwith _Pisidium pusillum_ to the number of at least two hundred,\r\nwhich had been probably attracted from the water in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood by the smell of the decaying flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             IV. _Hearing_\r\n\r\nExperiments made with a view to ascertain whether the Mollusca are\r\nsensitive to noises have usually led to the conclusion that they\r\nare deaf to very loud sounds. This is the more curious, because an\r\nundoubted auditory apparatus has been discovered in a large number\r\nof genera. In the case of an experiment, it is not easy to be sure\r\nthat the animal is not affected, at least in part, by the shock or\r\njar, rather than by the actual sound. In some experiments, however,\r\nconducted at the Plymouth Marine Biological Laboratory, Mr. Bateson\r\nfound[306] that _Anomia_ could be made to shut its shell by smearing\r\nthe glass of the tank with the finger in such a way as to make a\r\ncreaking sound. It was evident that the cause of alarm was not the\r\njarring of the solid framework of the tank, for the same result\r\noccurred when the object on which the _Anomia_ were fixed was suspended\r\nin the water by a thread. It was found that the sound had to be of a\r\nparticular pitch to excite the attention of the mollusc.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the organ of hearing is nothing more than a small vesicle\r\nor sac (the _otocyst_), filled with a fluid secretion, in which\r\nare suspended one or usually more calcareous concretions known as\r\n_otoliths_. By means of cilia, which connect with sense-cells, these\r\notoliths are given a peculiar movement or oscillation in the medium\r\nin which they are suspended. The number of the otoliths varies in\r\ndifferent genera and species; there are several hundreds in _Arion_ and\r\n_Limax_, about a hundred in _Helix pomatia_, _nemoralis_, _hispida_,\r\n_arbustorum_, _rotundata_, _Succinea putris_, and _Limnaea stagnalis_;\r\nabout fifty in _Planorbis contortus_ and _Physa fontinalis_, only\r\none in _Cyclostoma elegans_. The number increases with age. In young\r\nspecimens of _Limn. stagnalis_ as few as ten, nine, and seven have been\r\nnoticed.[307]\r\n\r\nThe otocysts are always paired, and, in Gasteropoda, are placed close\r\nto the pedal ganglia. The acoustic nerve, however, has been shown by\r\nLacaze-Duthiers to connect with the cerebral ganglia in certain cases.\r\nThe otocysts are never on the surface of the body and are rarely\r\nconnected with it by any passage or tube; it is probable therefore that\r\nsound reaches them simply through the medium of the tissues.\r\n\r\nIn the _Pelecypoda_ the otocyst is similarly situated near the pedal\r\nganglion, and is probably (though this has not yet been proved)\r\nsimilarly connected with the cerebral. There is only a single otolith.\r\nPelseneer finds[308] in Nuculidae alone a free communication between\r\nthe otocyst and the exterior. _Anodonta_ has been observed[309] to\r\nwithdraw its foot into the shell at the noise of an opening door, a\r\nloud voice, or a shrill whistle, whether in a basin of water or lying\r\non a study table.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 96.--Illustrating the otocyst in =A=,\r\n  _Anodonta_, =B=, _Cyclas_; _ot_, otolith; _a_, _b_, _c_, _c´_,\r\n  cellular layers surrounding the chamber; _ci_, cilia on interior\r\n  walls of chamber: =C=, an otolith crushed. (After Simroth.)]\r\n\r\nDelage extirpated the otocysts in certain Octopoda, and obtained some\r\nunexpected results. He found that remarkable effects were produced upon\r\nthe animal’s powers of locomotion, so that it was unable to preserve\r\nits proper balance in the water when in rapid motion, but its body\r\nwas forced to undergo a form of rotation more or less pronounced.\r\nHe concluded that the otocysts must possess, besides their auditory\r\nfunctions, a power which stands in some relation to the proper\r\norientation of the body in locomotion, a power which is not wholly\r\nsupplied by sight and touch alone. The otocysts may thus regulate\r\nlocomotion by stimulating muscular acts which tend to keep the body in\r\nthe straight line during the process of movement.[310]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               =The Foot=\r\n\r\nOne of the most characteristic organs of the Mollusca is the foot,\r\nwhich, under one form or another, occurs throughout the whole phylum.\r\nThe foot is a thickening, on the ventral side, of a portion of the\r\nintegument of the animal, modified to serve different forms of\r\nmotion. It attains its maximum relative area in the Chitonidae, many\r\nNudibranchs, and the slugs generally, in nearly all of which there is\r\nno portion of the body which is not subtended by the foot. Here too it\r\npresents the form of a regular disc or ellipse, which is more or less\r\nproduced. In many cases, however, the foot becomes modified in such a\r\nway that we are enabled to recognise well-marked anterior and posterior\r\nportions, which have received the name of _propodium_ and _metapodium_\r\nrespectively, while the intervening central portion is termed the\r\n_mesopodium_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 97.--_Sigaretus laevigatus_ Lam., showing\r\n  excessive development of the propodium (_pr_) and metapodium\r\n  (_met_) in a mollusc living in sand (the shell, which covers only\r\n  the liver and adjacent parts, has been removed); _l_, liver;\r\n  _s.ap_, aperture of proboscis, here deflected from the median\r\n  line; _t_, _t_, tentacles. (After Quoy and Gaimard.)]\r\n\r\nThe propodium is most strongly developed in genera which crawl about in\r\nwet sand, _e.g._ _Natica_, _Sigaretus_, _Oliva_, _Harpa_, _Scaphander_\r\n(Figs. 97 and 98, and compare Fig. 91). In such cases it seems to serve\r\nas a sort of fender or snow-plough, to push the sand away on both sides\r\nof the path the animal is traversing. In some species of _Sigaretus_\r\nthe propodium becomes as it were banked up against the head and\r\nproboscis, which are thus unnaturally elevated, or tend to disappear\r\naltogether. _Bullia_ (Fig. 62), which crawls about rapidly on wet sand,\r\nappears to attain its object by a wide extension of the foot on all\r\nsides, and so slides over the sand instead of ploughing through it;\r\nthe little lappets at the end of the ‘tail’ probably serve as rudders.\r\n\r\nIn _Melampus_ and _Pedipes_ the propodium is marked off by a groove\r\nacross the ventral surface. When the animal is in motion it first\r\nadvances the propodium and then pulls the rest of the foot after it\r\nwith the looping gait of certain caterpillars. In many Cyclostomatidae\r\nthis groove, instead of being transverse, is longitudinal, and the\r\nanimal advances first the right and then the left segment of the foot,\r\nwhich gives it a swaying motion from side to side.\r\n\r\nUpon the metapodium lies the operculum, when it occurs. As a rule the\r\nmetapodium is not sharply marked off from the rest of the foot. In\r\n_Strombus_ (Fig. 99) it becomes erected into a sort of hump or column,\r\non the top of which the operculum is situated.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 98.--_Oliva textilina_ Lam., showing how the\r\n  front part of the foot (_f_) is developed into a sort of fender,\r\n  the propodium (_pr_); _e_, _e_, eyes; _m.ap_, front appendage\r\n  of mantle; _m.ap´_, hinder appendage of mantle, folded into\r\n  the suture when the animal is at rest; _si_, siphon; _t_, _t_,\r\n  tentacles. (After Quoy and Gaimard.)]\r\n\r\nThe _epipodium_ is a prominent fold or border, which occurs upon the\r\nupper edge of the foot in most Diotocardia. In _Haliotis_ it is of\r\nconsiderable breadth, and is covered by a number of lobes which spring\r\nfrom a moss-like prolongation of the skin. From the epipodium are\r\ndeveloped the lateral tentaculae of _Monodonta_ (Fig. 82, p. 178), and\r\nof other sub-genera of the Trochidae.[311]\r\n\r\nIn the Opisthobranchiata the lateral edges of the foot (the\r\n_parapodia_) are frequently produced into broad folds or wing-like\r\nextensions, which in many cases tend to fold over the shell, and, in\r\nconjunction with the mantle, eventually imbed it altogether. By the\r\nwavy motion of the parapodia the animal is enabled to progress through\r\nthe water. The paired natatory lobes of the Pteropoda are simply the\r\nparapodia of the Tectibranchs modified for swimming purposes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 99.--_Strombus lentiginosus_ Lam., showing\r\n  the modified form of the foot (_f_): _e_, _e_, eyes on their\r\n  pedicels; _mp_, metapodium; _op_, operculum; _p_, penis; _pr_,\r\n  proboscis; _t_, _t_, tentacles. (After Quoy and Gaimard.)]\r\n\r\nIt is in the Heteropoda, Pteropoda, and most of all, the Cephalopoda,\r\ngroups which have, for the most part, exchanged a crawling for\r\na swimming life, that the modifications of the foot are most\r\nconsiderable. In _Oxygyrus_ and _Atlanta_, for instance, the propodium\r\nand metapodium are sharply distinguished from the mesopodium, and\r\nno doubt have acquired, as a means of propulsion, the power of\r\nseparate movement, the animal swimming with these portions of the\r\nfoot uppermost. In _Carinaria_ and _Pterotrachea_ the metapodium has\r\nprobably become continuous with the long axis of the body, while\r\nthe so-called ‘foot’ with its sucker represents only the original\r\npropodium. In the Cephalopoda the arms and funnel represent the\r\nmodified foot, the sides of which are prolonged into a number of very\r\nlong specialised tentaculae. In the adult Cephalopod some of the arms\r\nhave assumed a position in advance of the mouth, the latter being in\r\nfact surrounded by a circle of arms. But in the Cephalopod embryo the\r\nmouth opens as in the Gasteropoda, _i.e._ in advance of the arms, and\r\nit is only gradually that it becomes encircled by them. Arms and funnel\r\nalike are found to be innerved from the pedal ganglion.[312]\r\n\r\nThe pointed axe-shaped foot, which is characteristic of the majority of\r\nPelecypoda, is doubtless derived from a form more akin to the flattened\r\n‘sole’ of the Gasteropoda. A foot with something of this disc-shaped\r\nbase actually occurs in some of the Nuculidae, the parapodia being\r\nfurnished with pleats which recall similar formations in other Orders\r\n(Fig. 100). The principal modifications of the foot are due to its\r\nemployment as a burrowing organ. In genera which burrow but slightly\r\nit is small and feebly developed, while in genera which habitually\r\nexcavate, it becomes the largest and strongest organ of the body. At\r\nthe same time it has a tendency to shift its position from the ventral\r\nto the anterior margin, accompanied by a corresponding narrowing of\r\nthe shell, until it arrives at the position seen in Mollusca of the\r\nshape of _Mya_, _Pholas_, and _Solen_. In sedentary or attached genera,\r\n_e.g._ _Pecten_, _Chama_, _Ostrea_, the foot tends to become aborted.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 100.--_Yoldia limatula_ Say, Greenland,\r\n  showing the short plumed branchiae (_br_, _br_), the\r\n  gasteropodous foot (_f_), and the large labial palps (_l.p_,\r\n  _l.p_): =A=, as seen from the ventral margin; =B=, from the left\r\n  side, with the mantle turned back; _a.m_, position of anterior\r\n  adductor muscle; _i_, intestine; _l_, liver; _m_, _m_, mantle.]\r\n\r\nThe _byssus gland_, secreting a byssus of horny threads, is\r\ncharacteristic of many Pelecypoda, and may be observed by any one\r\nin the common mussel. It occurs in the larvae of many species which\r\ndo not possess a byssus in the adult stage. The pedal gland of many\r\nProsobranchiates, which secretes a tough and almost thread-like slime,\r\nis possibly homologous with the byssus gland of bivalves.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =Nervous System=\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca possess a nervous system, which usually consists of a\r\nnumber of nerve centres or _ganglia_, linked together by bands (the\r\n_commissures_) and sending out thread-like nerves which ramify into the\r\nvarious organs. The character of the nervous system varies greatly\r\nin different groups, ranging as it does from a condition of extreme\r\ncomplexity, in which the ganglia are numerous and the commissures\r\nequally so, to that of considerable simplicity, in which ganglia are\r\nalmost entirely absent.\r\n\r\nThe most important ganglia are (1) the _cerebral_,[313] which are\r\nalways placed above or on either side of the mouth, and from which\r\nproceed the nerves of the eyes and tentacles; (2) the _pedal_, which\r\nin Gasteropoda are situated below the oesophagus, in Pelecypoda at the\r\nbase of the foot, and from which the nerves of the foot and sometimes\r\nthe acoustic nerve arise; (3) the _pleural_,[314] whose position varies\r\nconsiderably, but is always below the oesophagus and slightly above\r\nthe pedal ganglia; these innervate the mantle, branchiae, heart, and\r\nviscera generally.\r\n\r\n=Gasteropoda.=--The simplest form of nerve system as thus understood\r\noccurs in the Amphineura, and more particularly in the Chitons. Here\r\nwe find four longitudinal nerve-cords, parallel to one another for\r\nnearly the whole length of the mollusc. The two exterior cords probably\r\nrepresent the pleural, the two interior the pedal nervous system.\r\nThere being no head or tentacles, but simply a mouth at the anterior\r\nend, the cerebral ganglia do not exist, but they are represented by\r\nthe curved ring formed by the massing together of the two nerve-cords\r\non each side. The only distinct ganglia are a pair of buccal ganglia\r\n(which are developed on a pair of commissures which pass forward from\r\nthe cerebral mass and innervate the lips and buccal region), and a much\r\nsmaller group, the sublingual. The two pedal cords are united by a\r\nnumber of transverse parallel connectives, which recall similar modes\r\nof connexion in the Chaetopod worms and in Arthropoda.\r\n\r\nThis quadruple set of nerve-cords is characteristic of all the\r\nAmphineura, but the absence of ganglia is most marked in the Chitons.\r\nIn _Proneomenia_ and _Neomenia_ there is a distinct cerebral\r\nganglion, formed by the massing of the two ganglia into one, while\r\nin _Proneomenia_ the lateral cords are joined to the pedal, as well\r\nas the pedal to one another, by connectives. In _Chaetoderma_ the\r\ncerebral ganglia, though adjacent, are distinct, and both the pedal and\r\nlateral cords connect directly with them, while there are no transverse\r\nconnectives.\r\n\r\nThe remaining three great divisions of Gasteropoda, namely, the\r\nProsobranchiata, Opisthobranchiata, and Pulmonata, may be regarded as\r\ncomprising two distinct types of nervous condition, according as the\r\nloop formed by the two visceral nerve-cords is twisted over itself,\r\nforming a figure of 8, or continues straight and uncrossed. In the\r\nformer case, we get the condition known as _streptoneurous_, in the\r\nlatter that as _euthyneurous_.[315] The _Euthyneura_ include the whole\r\nof the Opisthobranchiata[316] and Pulmonata, the _Streptoneura_ all the\r\nProsobranchiata.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 101.--Nervous system of the Amphineura:\r\n  =A=, _Proneomenia_; =B=, _Neomenia_; =C=, _Chaetoderma_; =D=,\r\n  _Chiton_; _c_, cerebral ganglia; _l_, _l_, lateral cords; _pc_,\r\n  posterior commissure; _s_, sublingual commissure or ring, with\r\n  ganglia; _v_, _v_, pedal cords. (Alter Hubrecht.)]\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of nervous system in the euthyneurous Gasteropoda\r\noccurs in the Opisthobranchiata. The cerebral, pleural, and pedal\r\nganglia tend to become concentrated in a ring-like form, united by\r\nshort commissures at the posterior end of the pharynx. The visceral\r\nloop is in some cases long, and the two or three visceral ganglia are\r\nthen situated at its posterior extremity. The nervous system of the\r\nPulmonata is of a similar type, the visceral loop being often much\r\nshorter, and tending to draw in towards the central group of ganglia.\r\nThe tentacular and optic nerves are, as usual, derived from the\r\ncerebral ganglion, with which also the octocysts are probably connected\r\nby rather long nerves. A pair of buccal ganglia innervate the buccal\r\nmass, and are united by commissures with the right and left cerebral\r\nganglia. The osphradial nerve springs from one of the ganglia on the\r\nvisceral loop, the osphradium itself being situated (in _Limnaea_)\r\nimmediately above the pulmonary orifice and adjacent to the anus (Fig.\r\n102). This massing of the ganglia is still better illustrated by the\r\naccompanying figure of _Physa_ (Fig. 103), in which the animal is\r\nrepresented as if transparent, so that the ganglia and nerves are seen\r\nthrough the tissues.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 102.--I.

The pedal nerves are united by transverse commissures\r\nthroughout their entire length, while a double commissure unites the\r\ncerebral ganglia to the mass from which the pedal nerves proceed.\r\nIn the great majority of the Streptoneura the ganglia (except the\r\nvisceral) are more concentrated and the commissures are consequently\r\nmuch shorter. The accompanying figure of _Cyclostoma_, in which\r\nthe animal is represented as in that of _Physa_ just described,\r\nillustrates this grouping of the ganglia, the twist of the visceral\r\nloop, and the position of the visceral ganglia at its posterior end.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 103.--Nervous system of _Physa acuta_\r\n  Drap., showing the massing of the ganglia at the hinder end of\r\n  the pharynx: _e_, _e_, eyes; _m_, mouth; _m.l_, _m.l_, mantle\r\n  lappets; _o.f_, female generative orifice; _o.m_, male generative\r\n  orifice; _os_, osphradium.

(After\r\n  Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\n=Scaphopoda.=--In the Scaphopoda the nervous system resembles that of\r\nthe Pelecypoda. The cerebral and pleural ganglia lie close together,\r\nwhile the pedal ganglia are placed in the anterior part of the foot,\r\nconnected with the cerebral ganglia by long commissures; the visceral\r\nloop is rather long, and the two visceral ganglia are adjacent to the\r\nanus.\r\n\r\n=Pelecypoda.=--The nervous system in the Pelecypoda is the simplest\r\ntype in which well-marked ganglionic centres occur. The ganglia are\r\nfew, symmetrically placed, and are usually at a considerable distance\r\napart. There are, as a rule, three distinct pairs of ganglia, the\r\ncerebral (cerebro-pleural), pedal, and visceral. The cerebral are\r\nformed by the fusion of the cerebral and pleural ganglia, which,\r\nhowever, in some cases (Protobranchiata) continue distinct.[317] They\r\nlie above or on each side of the mouth, united by a commissure of\r\nvarying length. Another pair of commissures unites them with the pedal\r\nganglia, which are placed at the base of the foot, and are usually\r\nvery close together, sometimes (as in _Anodonta_) becoming partially\r\nfused. The length of these commissures depends upon the distance\r\nbetween mouth and foot; thus they are very long in _Mya_ and _Modiola_,\r\nand very short in _Pecten_. In cases where the foot is rudimentary or\r\nbecomes aborted through disuse (_e.g._ _Ostrea_), the pedal ganglia\r\nmay dwindle or disappear altogether. The visceral ganglia are on the\r\nventral side of the posterior adductor muscle, beneath the rectum,\r\nand innervate the branchiae, osphradia, and the whole of the visceral\r\nsac. A pair of cerebro-visceral commissures traverses the base of the\r\nfoot, surrounding it with a comparatively short loop (compare Fig. 106,\r\n_c.v.c´_), while a long commissure, which runs round the entire edge\r\nof the mantle, and supplies branching nerves to the mantle border and\r\nsiphons (Fig. 106, _c.v.c_), may also connect the visceral and cerebral\r\nganglia.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 105.--Nervous system of Pelecypoda: _A_,\r\n  _Teredo_; _B_, _Anodonta_; _C_, _Pecten_; _a_, _a_, cerebral\r\n  ganglia; _b_, pedal ganglia; _c_, visceral ganglia. (After\r\n  Gegenbaur.)]\r\n\r\n=Cephalopoda.=--In the Cephalopoda the concentration of ganglia\r\nattains its maximum, and may perhaps be regarded as approaching the\r\npoint at which a definite brain may be said to exist. Another point\r\nof distinction is the formation of special small ganglia upon the\r\nnerve-cords in different parts of the body. In the Tetrabranchiata\r\n(_Nautilus_) the cerebral and pedal ganglia form a broad ring which\r\nsurrounds the oesophagus, the former giving out the optic nerves,\r\nwith their special optic ganglion, and a pair each of buccal and\r\npharyngeal ganglia, the latter the nerves of the arms and funnel. The\r\nvisceral loop is still present in the form of a separate band, which\r\ninnervates the branchiae, osphradia, and viscera generally, forming\r\na special genital ganglion in connexion with the reproductive organs.\r\nThe principal ganglia of the Dibranchiata are still more concentrated,\r\neven the visceral loop being possibly united with the rest in forming\r\nan unbroken mass in which scarcely any trace of commissures can be\r\ndetected. The pedal ganglion becomes separated into two portions,\r\none of which innervates the arms, the other the funnel. Two peculiar\r\nganglia (the stellate ganglia) supply a number of branching nerves to\r\nthe mantle.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 106.--Nervous system of _Cardium edule_\r\n  L.: _a.m_, anterior adductor muscle; _br_, branchiae; _br.n_,\r\n  branchial nerve; _c.g_, _c.g_, cerebral ganglia; _c.p.c_,\r\n  cerebro-pedal commissure; _c.v.c’_, cerebro-visceral commissure;\r\n  _c.v.c_, cerebro-visceral commissure of mantle; _l.p_, labial\r\n  palps: _m_, mouth; _p.g_, pedal ganglion; _p.m_, posterior\r\n  adductor muscle; _v.g_, visceral ganglion.

It may be regarded as\r\nconsisting of the following parts: (1) a _mouth_ or _oral aperture_:\r\n(2) a _throat_ or _pharynx_; (3) an _oesophagus_, leading into (4) a\r\n_stomach_, (5) an _intestine_ and _rectum_, ending in (6) an _anus_.\r\n\r\nThe primitive positions of mouth and anus were presumably at the\r\nanterior and posterior ends of the animal, as in the Amphineura and\r\nsymmetrical Mollusca generally. But the modifications of original\r\nmolluscan symmetry, which have already been referred to (p. 154,\r\ncompare pp. 245, 246), have resulted in the anus becoming, in the great\r\nmajority of Gasteropoda, twisted forward, and occupying a position on\r\nsome point in the right side in dextral, and in the left in sinistral\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe process of digestion, as the food passes from one end of the tract\r\nto the other, is performed by the aid of the secretions of various\r\nglands, which open into the alimentary canal at different points in\r\nits course. The principal of these are the _salivary glands_, situated\r\non the pharynx and oesophagus, and the _liver_, _biliary_ or _hepatic\r\ngland_, connecting with the stomach. With these may be considered the\r\n_anal_ and _ink-glands_, which, in certain genera, connect with the\r\nterminal portion of the rectum.\r\n\r\n1. The _mouth_ is generally, as in the common snail and periwinkle,\r\nplaced on the lower part of the head, and may be either a mere\r\naperture, circular or semicircular, in the head-mass, or, as is more\r\nusual, may be carried on a blunt snout (compare Fig. 6, p. 10, and Fig.\r\n68, p. 159), which is capable of varying degrees of protrusion. From\r\nthe retractile snout has doubtless been derived the long proboscis\r\nwhich is so prominent a feature of many genera (compare Figs. 1, B, and\r\n99), and in some (_e.g._ _Mitra_, _Dolium_) attains a length exceeding\r\nthat of the whole body. As a rule, Mollusca provided with a proboscis\r\nare carnivorous, while those whose mouth is on the surface of the head\r\nare Vegetable feeders, but this rule is by no means invariable. The\r\nmouth is thickened round the aperture into ‘lips,’ which are often\r\nextensile, and appear capable of closing upon and grasping the food.\r\nIn the Pelecypoda the mouth is furnished, on each side, with a pair\r\nof special external lobes, the ‘labial palps,’ which appear to be of\r\na highly sensitive nature, and whose object it is to collect, and\r\npossibly to taste, the food before it passes into the mouth.\r\n\r\n2. The _Pharynx, Jaws, and Radula_.--Immediately behind the lips the\r\nmouth opens into the muscular throat, pharynx, or buccal mass. The\r\npharynx of the Glossophora, _i.e._ of the Gasteropoda, Scaphopoda,\r\nand Cephalopoda, is distinguished from that of the Pelecypoda,[318]\r\nby the possession of two very characteristic organs for the rasping\r\nor trituration of food before it reaches the oesophagus and stomach.\r\nThese are (_a_) the _jaw_ or _jaws_, and (_b_) the _radula_,[319]\r\n_odontophore_, or _lingual ribbon_. The jaws bite the food, the\r\nradula tears it up small before it passes into the stomach to undergo\r\ndigestion. The jaws are not set with teeth like our own; roughly\r\nspeaking, the best idea of the relations of the molluscan jaw and\r\nradula may be obtained by imagining our own teeth removed from our jaws\r\nand set in parallel rows along a greatly prolonged tongue.[320]\r\n\r\nIn nearly all land Pulmonata the jaw is single, and is placed behind\r\nthe upper lip. If a common _Helix aspersa_ be observed crawling up\r\nthe inside of a glass jar, or feeding on some succulent leaf, the\r\nposition and action of the jaw can be readily discerned. It shows\r\nvery black when the creature opens its mouth, and under its operation\r\nthe edge of a lettuce leaf shows a regular series of little curved\r\nindentations, in shape not unlike the semicircular bites inflicted by\r\na schoolboy upon his bread and butter. The jaw of _Helix_ (Fig. 107,\r\nB) is arched in shape, and is strengthened by a number of projecting\r\nvertical ribs. That of _Limax_ (A) is straighter, and is slightly\r\nstriated, without vertical ribs. In _Bulimulus_ (C) the arch of the\r\njaw is very conspicuous, and the upper edges are always denticulated;\r\nin _Orthalicus_ there is a central triangular plate with a number of\r\noverlapping plates on either side; in _Succinea_ (E) there is a large\r\nsquare accessory plate above the jaw proper. The form of the jaw\r\nis peculiar not only to the genus but to the species as well. Thus\r\nthe jaw of _H. aspersa_ is specifically distinct from that of _H.\r\npomatia_, and that of _H. nemoralis_ is distinct from both. Wiegmann\r\nhas observed[321] that in young _Arion_, _Limax_, and _Helix_, the jaw\r\nconsists of two pieces, which coalesce by fusion in the adult, thus\r\nindicating a stage of development in advance of the double jaw which\r\nis found in most of the non-pulmonate Mollusca. In all fresh-water\r\nPulmonata there are two small accessory side plates besides the jaw\r\nproper (Fig. 107, F).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 107.--Jaws of various Pulmonata: =A=, _Limax_\r\n  (_gagates_ Drap., Lancashire, × 15); =B=, _Helix_ (_acutissima_\r\n  Lam., Jamaica, × 15); =C=, _Bulimulus_ (_depictus_ Reeve,\r\n  Venezuela, × 20); =D=, _Achatina_ (_fulica_ Fér., Mauritius, ×\r\n  7); =E=, _Succinea_ (_elegans_ Riss., Aral District, × 30); =F=,\r\n  _Limnaea_ (_stagnalis_ L., Cambridge, × 30).]\r\n\r\nNearly all the non-carnivorous Prosobranchiata, land, fresh-water,\r\nand marine alike, are provided with two large lateral jaws. Many of\r\nthese are sculptured with the most elaborate patterns, and appear to\r\nbe furnished with raised teeth, like a file. In the Nudibranchiata the\r\njaws are of great size and beauty of ornamentation (Fig. 109).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 108.--Jaws of =A=, _Triton australis_\r\n  Lam., Sydney; =B=, _Ampullaria fasciata_ Reeve, Demerara; =C=,\r\n  _Calliostoma punctulatum_ Mart., New Zealand; =D=, _Cyclophorus\r\n  atramentarius_ Sowb., Sanghir; all × 15.]\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 109.--Jaws of =A=, _Chromodoris\r\n  gracilis_ Iher., × 15; =B=, _Scyllaea pelagica_ L., × 7; =C=,\r\n  _Pleurobranchus plumula_ Mont., × 10; =D=, _Pleurobranchaea\r\n  Meckelii_ Lam., × 5/2.]\r\n\r\nThe carnivorous genera, whether marine (_e.g._ _Conus_, _Murex_,\r\n_Buccinum_, _Nassa_) or land (_e.g._ _Testacella_, _Glandina_,\r\n_Streptaxis_, _Ennea_), are entirely destitute of jaws, the reason\r\nprobably being that in all these cases the teeth of the radula are\r\nsufficiently powerful to do the work of tearing up the food without\r\nthe aid of a masticatory organ as well. Jaws are also wanting in the\r\nHeteropoda, and in many of the Nudibranchiata and Tectibranchiata.\r\n\r\nIn the Cephalopoda the jaws, or ‘beaks,’ as they are called, are most\r\nformidable weapons of attack. In shape they closely resemble the beaks\r\nof a parrot, but the hook on the dorsal side of the mouth does not,\r\nas in birds, close over the lower hook, but fits under it. Powerful\r\nmuscles govern these mandibles, which must operate with immense effect\r\nupon their prey (Fig. 110).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 110.--Jaws of _Sepia_: =A=, _in situ_ within\r\n  the buccal mass, several of the arms having been cut away; =B=,\r\n  removed from the mouth and slightly enlarged.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 111.--_Patella vulgata_ L., showing the\r\n  normal position of the radula, which is doubled back in a bow;\r\n  the shell has been removed, and the whole visceral mass is turned\r\n  forward, exposing the dorsal surface of the muscular foot:\r\n  _gr_, longitudinal groove on this surface; _i_, _i_, intestine;\r\n  _l_, liver; _m_, _m_, mantle edge; _mu_, muscles (cut through)\r\n  fastening the visceral mass to the upper sides of the foot; _ov_,\r\n  ovary; _r_, radula; _u.f_, upper or dorsal surface of the foot.]\r\n\r\n_The Radula._[322]--When the food has passed beyond the operation\r\nof the jaw, it comes within the province of the radula, the front\r\npart of which perhaps co-operates to a certain extent with the jaw in\r\nperforming the biting process. The function of the radula as a whole\r\nis to tear or scratch, not to bite; the food passes over it and is\r\ncarded small, the effect being very much the same as if, instead of\r\ndragging a harrow over the surface of a field, we were to turn the\r\nharrow points upwards, and then drag the field over the harrow.\r\n\r\nThe radula itself is a band or ribbon of varying length and breadth,\r\nformed of chitin, generally almost transparent, sometimes beautifully\r\ncoloured, especially at the front end, with red or yellow.[323] It lies\r\nenveloped in a kind of membrane, in the floor of the mouth and throat,\r\nbeing quite flat in the forward part, but usually curving up so as to\r\nline the sides of the throat farther back, and in some cases eventually\r\nforming almost a tube. The upper surface, _i.e._ the surface over\r\nwhich the food passes, is covered with teeth of the most varied shape,\r\nsize, number, and disposition, which are almost invariably arranged in\r\nsymmetrical rows. These teeth are attached to the cartilage on which\r\nthey work by muscles which serve to erect or depress them; probably\r\nalso the radula as a whole can be given a forward or backward motion,\r\nso as to rasp or card the substances which pass over it.\r\n\r\nThe teeth on the front part of the radula are often much worn (Fig.\r\n112), and probably fall away by degrees, their place being taken by\r\nothers successively pushed up from behind. At the extreme hinder end of\r\nthe radula the teeth are in a nascent condition, and there are often\r\nas many as a dozen or more scarcely developed rows. Here, too, lie the\r\ncells from which the teeth are originally formed.\r\n\r\nThe length and breadth of the radula vary greatly in different genera.\r\nIn _Littorina_ it is very narrow, and several times the length of the\r\nwhole animal. It is kept coiled away like a watch-spring at the back\r\nof the throat, only a small proportion of the whole being in use. I\r\nhave counted as many as 480 rows in the common _Littorina littorea_.\r\nIn _Patella_ it is often longer than the shell itself, and if the\r\nradula of a large specimen be freshly extracted and drawn across the\r\nhand, the action of the hooks can be plainly felt. In _Aerope_, the\r\nTurbinidae generally, and _Haliotis_ it is very large. In _Turritella_,\r\n_Aporrhais_, _Cylichna_, _Struthiolaria_, and the Cephalopoda it\r\nis small in proportion to the size of the animal. In the Pulmonata\r\ngenerally it is very broad, the length not exceeding, as a rule, thrice\r\nthe breadth; in most other groups the breadth is inconsiderable, as\r\ncompared to the length.\r\n\r\nThe Radula is wanting in two families of Prosobranchiata, the Eulimidae\r\nand Pyramidellidae, which are consequently grouped together as the\r\nsection Gymnoglossa. It is probable that in these cases the radula\r\nhas aborted through disuse, the animals having taken to a food\r\nwhich does not require trituration. Thus several genera contained\r\nin both these families are known to live parasitically upon various\r\nanimals--Holothurians, Echinoderms, etc.--nourishing themselves on\r\nthe juices of their host. In some cases, the development of a special\r\nsuctorial proboscis compensates for the loss of radula (see pp. 76–77).\r\nIn _Harpa_ there is no radula in the adult, though it is present in the\r\nyoung form. No explanation of this fact has yet been given. It is also\r\nabsent in the Coralliophilidae, a family closely akin to _Purpura_,\r\nbut invariably parasitic on corals, and probably nourished by their\r\nexudations. There is no radula in _Entoconcha_, an obscure form\r\nparasitic on the blood-vessels of _Synapta_, or in _Neomenia_, a genus\r\nof very low organisation, or in the Tethyidae, or sea-hares, or in one\r\nor two other genera of Nudibranchiata.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 112.--Example of a front portion of a radula\r\n  (_Cantharus ringens_ Reeve, Panama), much worn by use. × 70.]\r\n\r\nThe number of teeth in the radula varies greatly. When the teeth are\r\nvery large, they are usually few in number, when small, they are\r\nvery numerous. In the carnivorous forms, as a rule, the teeth are\r\ncomparatively few and powerful, while in the phytophagous genera they\r\nare many and small. Large hooked and sickle-shaped teeth, sometimes\r\nfurnished with barbs like an arrow-head, and poison-glands, are\r\ncharacteristic of genera which feed on flesh; vegetable feeders, on\r\nthe contrary, have the teeth rounded, and blunter at the apex, or, if\r\nlong and narrow, so slender as to be of comparatively little effect.\r\nGenera which are normally vegetarian, but which will, upon occasion,\r\neat flesh, _e.g._ _Limax_ and _Hyalinia_, exhibit a form of teeth\r\nintermediate between these two extremes (see Fig. 140, A).\r\n\r\nIn _Chaetoderma_ there is but one tooth. In _Aeolis coronata_ there are\r\nabout 17, in _A. papillosa_ and _Elysia viridis_ about 19, in _Glaucus\r\natlanticus_ about 21, in _Fiona nobilis_ about 28. In the common\r\nwhelk (_Buccinum undatum_) there are from 220 to 250, in the common\r\nperiwinkle about 3500. As many as 8343 have been counted in _Limnaea\r\nstagnalis_, about 15,000 in _Helix aspersa_ (that is, about 400,000\r\nto the square inch), about 30,000 in _Limax maximus_, and as many as\r\n40,000 in _Helix Ghiesbreghti_, a large species from Mexico; they are\r\nvery numerous also in _Nanina_, _Vitrina_, _Gadinia_, and _Actaeon_.\r\nBut _Umbrella_ stands far and away the first, as far as number of teeth\r\nis concerned. In both _U. mediterranea_ and _U. indica_ they entirely\r\nbaffle calculation, possibly 750,000 may be somewhere near the truth.\r\n\r\nThe teeth on the radula are almost invariably disposed in a kind of\r\npattern, exactly like the longitudinal rows of colour in a piece of\r\nribbon, down the centre of which runs a narrow stripe, and every band\r\nof colour on one side is repeated in the same relative position on\r\nthe other side. The middle tooth of each row--the rows being counted\r\nacross the radula, not longitudinally--is called the _central_ or\r\n_rachidian_ tooth; the teeth next adjacent on each side are known as\r\nthe _laterals_, while the outermost are styled _uncini_ or _marginals_.\r\nAs a rule, the distinction between the laterals and marginals is fairly\r\nwell indicated, but in the Helicidae and some of the Nudibranchiata it\r\nis not easy to perceive, and in these cases there is a very gradual\r\npassage from one set to the other.\r\n\r\nThe central tooth is nearly always present. It is wanting in certain\r\ngroups of Opisthobranchiata, some of the carnivorous Pulmonata, and\r\nin the Conidae and Terebridae, which have lost the laterals as well.\r\n_Voluta_ has lost both laterals and marginals in most of the species,\r\nand the same is the case with _Harpa_. In _Aeolis_, _Elysia_, and some\r\nother Nudibranchiata the radula consists of a single central row. Other\r\npeculiarities will be described below in their proper order.\r\n\r\nThe extreme importance of a study of the radula depends upon the fact,\r\nthat in each species, and _a fortiori_ in each genus and family, the\r\nradula is characteristic. In closely allied species the differences\r\nexhibited are naturally but slight, but in well-marked species the\r\ndifferences are considerable. The radula, therefore, serves as a test\r\nfor the distinction of genera and species. For instance, in the four\r\nknown recent genera of the family Strombidae, _viz._ _Strombus_,\r\n_Pteroceras_, _Rostellaria_, and _Terebellum_, the radula is of the\r\nsame general type throughout, but with distinct modifications for each\r\ngenus; and the same is true, though to a lesser extent, for all the\r\nspecies hitherto examined in each of the genera. These facts are true\r\nfor all known genera, differences of the radula corresponding to and\r\nemphasising those other differences which have caused genera to be\r\nconstituted. The radula therefore forms a _basis of classification_,\r\nand it is found especially useful in this respect in dealing with the\r\nlargest class of all, the Gasteropoda, and particularly with the chief\r\nsection of this order, the Prosobranchiata. Thus we have--\r\n\r\n                                       { (_a_) _Toxoglossa_\r\n                                       { (_b_) _Rachiglossa_\r\n                      { _Monotocardia_ { (_c_) _Taenioglossa_\r\n                      {                { (_d_) _Ptenoglossa_\r\n    =Prosobranchiata= {                { (_e_) _Gymnoglossa_\r\n                      {\r\n                      { _Diotocardia_  { (_f_) _Rhipidonlossa_\r\n                                       { (_g_) _Docoglossa_[324]\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Toxoglossa._--Only three families, Terebridae, Conidae, and\r\nCancellariidae, belong to this section. There is no central tooth,\r\nand no laterals, the radula consisting simply of large marginals on\r\neach side. In _Conus_ these are of great size, with a blunt base which\r\ncontains a poison-gland (see p. 66), the contents of which are carried\r\nto the point by a duct. The point is always singly and sometimes doubly\r\nbarbed (Fig. 116). When extracted, the teeth resemble a small sheaf\r\nof arrows (Figs. 113, 115). A remarkable form of radula, belonging to\r\n_Spirotropis_ (a sub-genus of _Drillia_, one of the Conidae), enables\r\nus to explain the true history of the radula in the Toxoglossa. Here\r\nthere are five teeth in a row, a central tooth, and one lateral and one\r\nmarginal on each side, the marginals being very similar in shape to the\r\ncharacteristic shafts of the Conidae (Fig. 114). It is evident, then,\r\nthat the great mass of the Toxoglossa have lost both their central\r\nand lateral teeth, and that those which remain are true uncini or\r\nmarginals. _Spirotropis_ appears to be the solitary survival of a group\r\nretaining the primitive form of radula.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 113.--Radula of _Bela turricula_ Mont. × 70.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 114.--Portion of radula of _Spirotropis\r\n  carinata_ Phil., Norway. × 70.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 115.--Eight teeth from the radula of _Terebra\r\n  caerulescens_ Lam. × 60.]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of teeth in all these sections is expressed by a\r\nformula applicable to each transverse row of the series. The central\r\ntooth, if present, is represented by 1, and the laterals and marginals,\r\naccording to their number, on each side of the central figure. Thus the\r\ntypical formula of the Toxoglossa is 1.0.0.0.1, the middle 0 standing\r\nfor the central tooth which is absent, and the 0 on each side of it for\r\nthe absent laterals; the 1 on each extreme represents the one uncinus\r\nin each row. Thus the formula for _Spirotropis_, which has also one\r\nlateral on each side and a rachidian or central tooth, is 1.1.1.1.1.\r\nOften the formula is given thus: 1.0.0.0.1 / 30, 1.1.1.1.1 / 42, where\r\n30 and 42 stand for the average number of _rows_ of teeth in _Conus_\r\nand _Spirotropis_ respectively; the same is sometimes expressed thus:\r\n1.0.0.0.1 × 30; 1.1.1.1.1 × 42.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 116.--A tooth from the radula of _Conus\r\n  imperialis_ L., S. Pacific, × 50, showing barb and poison duct.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 117.--Portion of the radula of _Melongena\r\n  vespertilio_ Lam., Ceylon. × 30.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 118.--Portion of the radula of _Eburna\r\n  japonica_ Sowb., China. × 30.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 119.--Portion of the radula of _Murex regius_\r\n  Lam., Panama. × 60.]\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _Rachiglossa_ comprise the 12 families Olividae, Harpidae,\r\nMarginellidae, Volutidae, Mitridae, Fasciolariidae, Turbinellidae,\r\nBuccinidae, Nassidae, Columbellidae, Muricidae, and Coralliophilidae.\r\nCertainly most and probably all of these families are or have been\r\ncarnivorous, the Coralliophilidae being a degraded group which have\r\nbecome parasitic on corals, and have lost their teeth in consequence.\r\nThe characteristics of the group are the possession of a central tooth\r\nwith from one cusp (_Boreofusus_) to about fourteen (_Bullia_), and\r\na single lateral more or less cuspidate, the outer cusp of all being\r\ngenerally much the largest. Thus in _Melongena respertilio_ (Fig. 117)\r\nthe central tooth is tricuspid, the central cusp being the smallest,\r\nwhile the laterals are bicuspid; in _Eburna japonica_ (Fig. 118) the\r\ncentral tooth is 5-cusped, the two outer cusps being much the smallest.\r\nThe teeth, on the whole, are sharp and hooked, with a broad base and\r\nformidable cutting edge. In the Olividae, _Turricula_, _Buccinopsis_,\r\nand the Muricidae the laterals are unicuspid and somewhat degraded\r\n(Fig. 119). In _Mitra_ and the Fasciolariidae they are very broad and\r\nfinely equally toothed like a comb (Figs. 120, 121). The whole group is\r\ndestitute of marginals.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 120.--Portion of the radula of _Imbricaria\r\n  marmorata_ Swains. × 80.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 121.--Three rows of teeth from the radula of\r\n  _Fasciolaria trapezium_ Lam. × 40.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 122.--Six teeth from the radula of _Cymbium\r\n  diadema_ Lam., Torres Strait. × 25.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 123.--Examples of degraded forms of radula:\r\n  =A=, _Cantharus pagodus_ Reeve, Panama (nascent end), × 40; =A´=,\r\n  same radula, central and front portion; =B=, _Columbella varia_\r\n  Sowb., Panama, × 50.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 124.--Three rows of the radula of _Sistrum\r\n  spectrum_ Reeve, Tonga, × 80. The laterals to the right are not\r\n  drawn in.]\r\n\r\nSeveral remarkable peculiarities occur. _Harpa_ loses the radula\r\naltogether in the adult. In the young it has lost only the laterals,\r\nand consists of nothing but the central tooth. _Marginella_ has no\r\nlaterals; the central tooth is small and comb-shaped, with blunt cusps.\r\nIn _Voluta_ the laterals are generally lost, but in _Volutomitra_ and\r\none species of _Voluta_[325] they are retained. The central tooth\r\nusually has three strong cusps, and is very thick and coloured a deep\r\nred or orange (Fig. 122); in the sub-genus _Amoria_ it is unicuspid, in\r\nshape rather like a spear-head with broadened wings; in _Volutolyria_\r\nit is of a different type, with numerous unequal denticulations,\r\nsomething like the laterals of _Mitra_ or _Fasciolaria_. Of the\r\nMitridae, _Cylindromitra_ has lost the laterals. Among the Buccinidae,\r\n_Buccinopsis_ possesses a curiously degraded radula, the central\r\ntooth having no cusps, but being reduced to a thin basal plate, while\r\nthe laterals are also weakened. This degradation from the type is a\r\nremarkable feature among radulae, and appears to be characteristic,\r\nsometimes of a whole family, _e.g._ the Columbellidae (Fig. 123, B),\r\nsometimes of a genus, sometimes again of a single species. Thus in\r\n_Cantharus_ (a sub-genus of _Buccinum_) the radula is typical in the\r\ngreat majority of species, but in _C. pagodus_ Reeve, a large and\r\nwell-grown species, it is most remarkably degraded, both in the central\r\nand lateral teeth (Fig. 123, A). This circumstance is the more singular\r\nsince _C. pagodus_ lives at Panama side by side with _C. ringeus_\r\nand _C. insignis_, both of which have perfectly typical radulae. It\r\nis probable that the nature of the food has something to do with the\r\nphenomenon. Thus _Sistrum spectrum_ Reeve was found to possess a very\r\naberrant radula, not of the common muricoid type, but with very long\r\nreed-like laterals. This singularity was a standing puzzle to the\r\npresent writer, until he was fortunate enough to discover that _S.\r\nspectrum_, unlike all other species of _Sistrum_, lives exclusively on\r\na branching coral.\r\n\r\nThe dental formula for the _Rachiglossa_ is thus 1.1.1, except in those\r\ncases where the laterals are absent, when it is 0.1.0.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 125.--Portion of the radula of _Cassis\r\n  sulcosa_ Born., × 40. The marginals to the right are not fully\r\n  drawn.]\r\n\r\n(_c_) The _Taenioglossa_ comprise 46 families in all, of which the\r\nmost important are Tritonidae, Cassididae, Cypraeidae, Strombidae,\r\nCerithiidae, Turritellidae, Melaniidae, Littorinidae, Rissoidae,\r\nPaludinidae, Ampullariidae, Cyclophoridae, Cyclostomatidae, and\r\nNaticidae. The radula is characterised by a central tooth of very\r\nvariable form, the prevailing type being multicuspid, the central cusp\r\nthe largest, on a rather broad base; a single lateral, which is often a\r\nbroad plate, more or less cusped, and two uncini, rather narrow, with\r\nsingle hooks, or slightly cusped. The accompanying figures of _Cassis_,\r\n_Vermetus_, and _Cypraea_, and those of _Littorina_ and _Cyclophorus_\r\ngiven on pp. 20, 21, are good examples of typical taenioglossate\r\nradulae.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 126.--Four rows of teeth from the radula of\r\n  _Vermetus grandis_ Gray, Andamans. × 40.]\r\n\r\nIn _Homalogyra_ the radula is much degraded, the central tooth is\r\nlarge and triangular on a broad base, the lateral is represented only\r\nby a thin oblong plate, and the uncini are absent. In some species\r\nof _Jeffreysia_ the uncini are said to be absent, while present in\r\nothers. _Lamellaria_ has lost both its uncini, but the radula of the\r\nallied _Velutina_ is quite typical. A peculiar feature in this group\r\nis the tendency of the marginals to increase in number. A stage in\r\nthis direction is perhaps seen in _Ovula_, _Pedicularia_, and the\r\n_Cyclostomatidae_. Here the outermost of the two marginals is by far\r\nthe larger and broader, and is strongly pectinated on its upper edge;\r\nin the _Cyclostomatidae_ the pectinations are rather superficial;\r\nin _Ovula_ (where both marginals are pectinated) they are decidedly\r\ndeeper; in _Pedicularia_ they are deeper still, and make long slits\r\nin the tooth, tending to subdivide it altogether. In _Turritella_ the\r\nnumber of marginals is said to vary from none (in _T. acicula_) to\r\nthree (_T. triplicata_), but the fact wants confirmation. _Solarium_\r\nis an aberrant form, possessing simply a number of long uncini, which\r\nrecall those of _Conus_ or _Pleurotoma_, and is therefore hard to\r\nclassify; the allied _Torinia_ has a radula which appears allied\r\nto _Ovula_ or _Pedicularia_. In _Triforis_ the teeth are identical\r\nthroughout, very small, about 27 in a row, tricuspid on a square base,\r\ncusps short.\r\n\r\nThe normal formula of the _Taenioglossa_ is 2.1.1.1.2; in _Lamellaria_,\r\n1.1.1; in _Triforis_, 13.1.13, or thereabouts.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 127.--Two rows of the radula of _Cypraea\r\n  tigris_ L. × 30.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 128.--Portion of the radula of _Ianthina\r\n  communis_ Lam. × 40.]\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Ptenoglossa._--This section consists of two families only,\r\nwhich certainly appear remarkably dissimilar in general habits\r\nand appearance, _viz._, the Ianthinidae and Scalariidae. In all\r\nprobability their approximation is only provisional. The radula,\r\nwhich in _Ianthina_ is very large, and in _Scalaria_ very small,\r\npossesses an indefinite number of long hooked teeth, of which the\r\noutermost are the largest. The central tooth, if present (it does not\r\noccur in _Ianthina_), is the smallest in the series, and thus recalls\r\nthe arrangement in some of the carnivorous _Pulmonata_ (p. 232). In\r\n_Ianthina_ the radula is formed of two large divisions, with a gap\r\nbetween them down the middle.\r\n\r\nThe formula is ∞.1.∞ or ∞.O.∞ according as the central tooth in\r\n_Scalaria_ is or is not reckoned to exist.\r\n\r\n(_e_) _Gymnoglossa._--In the absence of both jaw and radula it is\r\nnot easy to classify the two families (Eulimidae and Pyramidellidae)\r\nwhich are grouped under this section. Fischer regards them as modified\r\nPtenoglossa; one would think it more natural to approximate them to the\r\nTaenioglossa.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 129.--Portion of the radula of _Margarita\r\n  umbilicalis_ Brod., Labrador. × 75 and 300.]\r\n\r\n(_f_) _Rhipidoglossa._--This section consists of seventeen families,\r\nthe most important being the Helicinidae, Neritidae, Turbinidae,\r\nTrochidae, Haliotidae, Pleurotomariidae, and Fissurellidae. The radula\r\nis characterised by--\r\n\r\n(1) The extraordinary development of the uncini, of which there are so\r\nmany that they are always reckoned as indefinitely numerous. They are\r\nlong, narrow, hooked, and often cusped at the top, and crowded together\r\nlike the ribs of a fan, those at the extreme edge not being set\r\nstraight in the row, but curving away backwards as they become smaller;\r\nin _Solariella_ alone, where there are from five to ten, can they be\r\ncounted.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 130.--Portion of the radula of _Nerita\r\n  albicilla_ L., Andaman Is., with central tooth highly magnified:\r\n  _c_, _c_, the capituliform tooth. × 40.]\r\n\r\n(2) The varying number of the laterals. The average number of these\r\nis five on each side; in some cases (_Livona_) there are as many as\r\nnine, in some (_Neritopsis_) only three. The lateral next to the uncini\r\n(which is specially large in the Neritidae, and is then known as the\r\n_capituliform_ tooth) is regarded by some authorities as the first\r\nuncinus, by others as the sole representative of the laterals, the\r\nteeth on the inner side of it being reckoned as multiplied central\r\nteeth. According to this latter view, _Livona_ will have as many\r\nas seventeen central teeth. Taking five as the average number of\r\n‘laterals,’ we shall have the following different ways of constituting\r\nthe rhipidoglossate formula, the first being that to which preference\r\nis given, _viz._:--\r\n\r\n   (1) ∞.5.1.5.∞, _i.e._ one central, five laterals, including\r\n   the ‘last lateral’ tooth.\r\n\r\n   (2) (∞.1).4.1.4.(1.∞), regarding the ‘last lateral’ as first\r\n   uncinus, but specialising it by a number.\r\n\r\n   (3) ∞.1.(4.1.4).1.∞, regarding the ‘last lateral’ as the only\r\n   lateral.\r\n\r\nIn the Neritidae and the derived fresh-water genera (_Neritina_,\r\n_Navicella_) the first lateral, as well as the capituliform\r\ntooth, is very large, and in shape rather like the blade bone of\r\na shoulder of mutton; the intervening laterals are very small. In\r\n_Neritopsis_ (a degraded form) the central tooth and first lateral\r\nare entirely wanting. In the neritiform land-shells (_Helicina_,\r\n_Proserpina_) the first lateral is no larger than the others, while\r\nthe capituliform tooth is enormous. _Hydrocena_ is a very aberrant\r\nand apparently degraded form; the laterals between the first and the\r\ncapituliform tooth are all wanting. In _Haliotis_, _Scissurella_,\r\nand _Pleurotomaria_ the five laterals are of fairly equal size; in\r\n_Fissurella_ we again meet with a large capituliform tooth, with very\r\nsmall laterals.\r\n\r\n(_g_) The _Docoglossa_ are in direct contrast with the Rhipidoglossa\r\nin possessing few and strong teeth, instead of many and weak. There\r\nare only three families, Acmaeidae, Patellidae, and Lepetidae. In some\r\nof the Acmaeidae there are not more than two teeth in a row, while in\r\nno species are there more than twelve. The radula is, however, very\r\nlong; there are as many as 180 rows in _Patella vulgata_. The teeth\r\nare thick, generally of a very deep red horn colour, rather opaque.\r\nThe cartilage in which they are set is remarkably thick, and in some\r\nspecies whose teeth are very few a considerable portion of this\r\ncartilage is left quite bare.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 131.--Portion of the radula of _Patella\r\n  cretacea_ Reeve, seen in half profile. × 40.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the teeth are so few, the arrangement is by no means simple.\r\nThe special feature of the group is the multiplication of identical\r\ncentrals. Of these there are two in _Acmaea_, and four, as a rule,\r\nin _Patella_. Thus in these two genera there is seldom an absolutely\r\n_central_ tooth. Either laterals or marginals are liable to be lost,\r\nbut there are never more than two of either in _Acmaea_, and never\r\nmore than two laterals and three marginals in _Patella_. Thus the\r\nformula varies from 0.0.(1 + 0 + 1).0.0 in _Pectinodonta_, 2.2.(1 + 0\r\n+ 1).2.2 in _Collisellina_ (both Acmaeidae), to 3.2.(1 + 0 + 1).2.3\r\nin _Patinella_, and 3.1.(2 + 0 + 2).1.3 in _Patella_ proper. In the\r\nLepetidae there is an absolutely central tooth, which appears to be\r\nmade up of the coalescence of several teeth, no laterals, and about two\r\nmarginals; formula, 2.0.1.0.2.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 132.--Two rows of the radula of\r\n  _Pterotrachea mutica_ Les., Naples. × 60.]\r\n\r\nThe radula of the _Heteropoda_ is quite characteristic, and shows\r\nno sign of affinity with any other Prosobranchiate. The central tooth\r\nis large, broad, tricuspid, and denticulated on a broad base; the\r\nsingle lateral is strong, often bicuspid; the two marginals simple,\r\nlong, falciform; formula, 2.1.1.1.2 (Fig. 132).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 133.--=A=, Portion of the radula of _Chiton_\r\n  (_Acanthopleura_) _spiniger_] Sowb., Andamans, × 30; =B=, portion\r\n  of the radula of _Dentalium entalis_ L., Clyde, × 50.]\r\n\r\n=Amphineura.=--(_a_) _Polyplacophora._--The radula of the _Chitonidae_\r\nis quite unique. It resembles that of the _Docoglossa_ in being very\r\nlong, and composed of thick and dark horn-coloured teeth. The number of\r\nteeth, however, is considerably greater, amounting almost invariably\r\nto seventeen in each row. There are three rather small central teeth,\r\nthe two outer of these being similar; next comes a very large lateral\r\n(the _major_ lateral), usually tricuspid, which is followed by two much\r\nsmaller laterals, which are scarcely more than accessory plates; then\r\na very large and arched marginal (the _major_ uncinus), at the outer\r\nside of which are three accessory plates. Some consider there is only\r\none central tooth, and count the two small teeth on each side of it as\r\nlaterals.\r\n\r\nThus the formula is either (3 + 1).(2 + 1).3.(1 + 2).(1 + 3) or (3 +\r\n1).(2 + 1 + 1).1.(1 + 1 + 2).(1 + 3).\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Aplacophora._--Of this rather obscure order, _Chaetoderma_ has a\r\nsingle strong central tooth, _Neomenia_ has no radula, _Proneomenia_\r\nand _Lepidomenia_ have about twenty falciform teeth, much larger at one\r\nend of the radula than the other; formula, 0.1.0.\r\n\r\n=Opisthobranchiata.=--The radula of the Opisthobranchiata is\r\nexceedingly variable in shape, size, and number and character of\r\nteeth. Not only do allied families differ greatly from one another,\r\nbut allied genera often possess radulae widely distinct in plan.\r\nThus, among the Polyceridae, _Goniodoris_ has no central tooth, one\r\nlarge lateral and one marginal (form. 1.1.0.1.1); _Doridunculus_ the\r\nsame, with five marginals (form. 5.1.0.1.5); _Lamellidoris_ one each\r\nof median, laterals, and marginals (1.1.1.1.1); _Idalia_, _Ancula_,\r\nand _Thecacera_ the same as _Goniodoris_; _Crimora_ several each of\r\nlaterals and marginals. Even species of the same genus may differ; thus\r\nthe formula for _Aeolis papillosa_ is 0.1.0, but for _Ae. Landsbergi_\r\n1.1.1; for _Philine aperta_ 1.0.1, but for _Philine pruinosa_ 6.0.6.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 134.--Two teeth from the radula of _Aeolis\r\n  papillosa_ L. × 55.]\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten, however, that a simple repetition of the same\r\ntooth, whether lateral or marginal, does not necessarily constitute\r\nan important characteristic, nor does the presence or absence of a\r\ncentral tooth. In most of the cases mentioned above, the difference in\r\nthe number of laterals and marginals is due to the multiplication of\r\nidentical forms, while the central tooth, when present, is often a mere\r\nplate or narrow block without cusps, whose presence or absence makes\r\nlittle difference to the character of the radula as a whole.\r\n\r\nThere appear to be three well-marked types of radula among the\r\nOpisthobranchiata.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Radula with a single strong central tooth, rows few. This form\r\nis characteristic of the Aeolididae, Fionidae, Glaucidae, Dotoidae,\r\nHermaeidae, Elysiidae (Fig. 135), and Limapontiidae. In the Aeolididae\r\nit is sometimes accompanied by a single lateral. The same type occurs\r\nin _Oxynoe_, and in _Lobiger_ (= _Lophocercus_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) Radula with the first lateral very strongly developed. This type\r\nmay take the form of (1) a single lateral, no central or marginals,\r\n_e.g._ _Onchidoris_, _Scaphander_ (Fig. 137, A), _Philine_ (certain\r\nspecies), _Ringicula_, or (2) first lateral strongly developed, and\r\nrepeated in succeeding laterals (2–6) on a smaller scale, _e.g._\r\n_Philine_ (certain species). A few marginals are sometimes added,\r\n_e.g._ in _Polycera_, _Lamellidoris_ (where there is a degraded central\r\ntooth, Fig. 137, B), _Idalia_, and _Ancula_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 135.--Radula of _Elysia viridis_ Mont. × 40.\r\n  Type (_a_).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 136.--Portion of the radula of _Gadinia\r\n  peruviana_ Sowb., Chili. × 250. Type (_c_).]\r\n\r\n(_c_) Radula with an indefinite number of marginals, laterals (if\r\npresent) merging into marginals, central tooth present or absent,\r\ninconspicuous, teeth all very small. This type of radula, among the\r\nNudibranchiata, is characteristic of certain sub-genera of _Doris_\r\n(_e.g._ _Chromodoris_, _Aphelodoris_, _Casella_, _Centrodoris_), of\r\n_Hypobranchiaea_ and _Pleurophyllidia_; among the Tectibranchiata,\r\nof _Actaeon_, many of the Bullidae, _Aplustrum_, the Aplysiidae,\r\n_Pleurobranchus_, _Umbrella_ and _Gadinia_ (Figs. 136 and 137, C).\r\n\r\nIn the _Pteropoda_ there are two types of radula. The Gymnosomata,\r\nwhich are in the main carnivorous, possess a radula with a varying\r\nnumber (4–12) of sickle-shaped marginals, central tooth present or\r\nabsent. In the Thecosomata, which feed on a vegetable diet, there are\r\nnever more than three teeth, a central and a marginal on each side;\r\nteeth more or less cusped on a square base.\r\n\r\n=Pulmonata.=--The radula of the Testacellidae, or carnivorous land\r\nMollusca, is large, and consists of strong sickle-shaped teeth with\r\nvery sharp points, arranged in rows with or without a central tooth,\r\nin such a way that the largest teeth are often on the outside, and the\r\nsmallest on the inside of the row (as in _Rhytida_, Fig. 139). The\r\nnumber and size of the teeth vary. In _Testacella_ and _Glandina_,\r\nthey are numerous, consisting of from 30 to 70 in a row, with about\r\n50 rows, the size throughout being fairly uniform. In _Aerope_ they\r\nare exceedingly large, and only eight in a row, the outermost marginal\r\nbeing probably the largest single tooth in the whole of the Mollusca.\r\nThe central tooth is always obscure, being, when present, simply a\r\nweaker form of the weakest lateral; in genera with only a few teeth in\r\na row it is generally absent altogether.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 137.--Portions of the radula of\r\n  Opisthobranchiata, illustrating types (_b_) and (_c_); =A=,\r\n  _Scaphander lignarius_ L.; =A´=, one of the teeth seen from the\r\n  other side, × 40; =B=, _Lamellidoris bilamellata_ L., Torbay, ×\r\n  60; =C=, _Hydatina physis_ L., E. Indies, × 75.]\r\n\r\nThe first family of jaw-bearing snails, the Selenitidae, is distinctly\r\nintermediate. The possession of a jaw relates it to the main body of\r\nHelicidae, but the jaw is not strong, while the teeth are still, with\r\nthe exception of the central, thoroughly Testacellidan. The central\r\ntooth is quite rudimentary, but it is something more than a mere\r\nweak reproduction of the marginals. There are no true laterals. The\r\nLimacidae show a further stage in the transition. Here the central\r\ntooth has a definite shape of its own, tricuspid on a broad base, which\r\nis more or less repeated in the first laterals; these, as they approach\r\nthe marginals, gradually change in form, until the outer marginals\r\nare again thoroughly Testacellidan.[326] This is the general form\r\nof radula, varied more or less in different genera, which occurs in\r\n_Nanina_, _Helicarion_, _Limax_, _Parmacella_, and all the sub-genera\r\nof _Zonites_. It is certain that some, and probable that all of these\r\ngenera will, on occasion, eat flesh, although their usual food appears\r\nto be vegetable. The jaw is more powerful than in the Selenitidae, but\r\nnever so large or so strongly ribbed as in _Helix_ proper.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 138.--Portion of the radula of _Glandina\r\n  truncata_ Gmel. × 40.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 139.--Portion of the radula of _Rhytida\r\n  Kraussii_ Pfr., S. Africa. × 25.]\r\n\r\nWhen we reach the Helicidae, we arrive at a type of radula\r\nin which the aculeate form of tooth--so characteristic of the\r\nAgnatha--disappears even in the marginals, and is replaced by teeth\r\nwith a more or less quadrate base; the laterals, which are always\r\npresent, are intermediate in form between the central and the\r\nmarginals, and insensibly pass into the latter. In size and number\r\nof cusps the first few laterals resemble the central tooth; in the\r\nextreme marginals the cusps often become irregular or evanescent. As\r\na rule, the teeth are set squarely in the rows, with the exception of\r\nthe extreme marginals, which tend to slope away on either side. In\r\nsome Helicidae there is a slight approximation to the Zonitidae in the\r\nelongation of the first marginals.\r\n\r\nThe above is the type of radula occurring in the great family\r\nHelicidae, which includes not only _Helix_ proper, with several\r\nthousand species, but also _Arion_, _Bulimus_, _Ariolimax_, and other\r\ngenera. The jaw is almost always strongly transversely ribbed.\r\n\r\nIn the _Orthalicidae_ (Fig. 140, C) the teeth of the radula, instead of\r\nbeing in straight rows, slope back at an angle of about 45 degrees from\r\nthe central tooth. The central and laterals are very similar, with an\r\nobtuse cusp on rather a long stem; the marginals become bicuspid.\r\n\r\nIn the _Bulimulidae_, which include the important genera _Placostylus_,\r\n_Amphidromus_, _Partula_, _Amphibulimus_, and all the groups of South\r\nAmerican _Bulimulus_, the jaw is very characteristic, being thin,\r\narched, and denticulated at the edges, as if formed of numerous\r\nnarrow folds overlapping one another. The radula is like that of the\r\nHelicidae, but the inner cusp of the laterals is usually lengthened and\r\nincurved. In _Partula_ the separation between laterals and marginals is\r\nvery strongly marked.\r\n\r\nThe remaining families of Pulmonata must be more briefly described. In\r\nthe _Cylindrellidae_ there are three distinct types of radula: (_a_)\r\nCentral tooth a narrow plate, laterals all very curiously incurved\r\nwith a blunt cusp, no marginals (Fig. 140, D); (_b_) radula long and\r\nnarrow, central tooth as in (_a_), two laterals, and about eight small\r\nmarginals; (_c_) much more helicidan in type, central and laterals\r\nobtusely unicuspid, marginals quite helicidan. Type (_c_) is restricted\r\nto Central America, types (_a_) and (_b_) are West Indian.\r\n\r\n_Pupidae_: Radula long and narrow; teeth of the helicidan type,\r\ncentrals and laterals tricuspid on a quadrate base, marginals very\r\nsmall, cusps irregular and evanescent. This type includes _Anostoma_,\r\n_Odontostomus_, _Buliminus_, _Vertigo_, _Strophia_, _Holospira_,\r\n_Clausilia_, and _Balea_.\r\n\r\n_Stenogyridae_, including _Achatina_, _Stenogyra_, and all its\r\nsub-genera: Central tooth small and narrow, laterals much larger,\r\ntricuspid, central cusp long, marginals similar, but smaller.\r\n\r\n_Achatinellidae_: Two types occur; (_a_) teeth in very oblique rows,\r\ncentral, laterals, and marginals all of the same type, base narrow,\r\nhead rather broad, with numerous small denticles (_Achatinella_ proper,\r\nwith _Auriculella_ and _Tornatellina_, Fig. 140, E); (_b_) central\r\ntooth small and narrow, laterals bicuspid, marginals as in _Helix_\r\n(_Amastra_ and _Carelia_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 140.--Portions of the radula of =A=,\r\n  _Hyalinia nitidula_ Drap., Yorkshire, with central tooth, first\r\n  lateral, and a marginal very highly magnified; =B=, _Helix\r\n  pomatia_ L., Kent, showing central tooth, laterals, and one\r\n  extreme marginal, the two former also highly magnified; =C=,\r\n  _Orthalicus undatus_ Brug., Trinidad, with three laterals highly\r\n  magnified; =D=, _Cylindrella rosea_ Pfr., Jamaica, central tooth\r\n  and laterals, the same very highly magnified; =E=, _Achatinella\r\n  vulpina_ Fér., Oahu, central tooth (_c_) and laterals, the same\r\n  highly magnified.]\r\n\r\n_Succineidae_: Central and laterals helicidan, bi- or tricuspid on a\r\nquadrate plate, marginals denticulate on a narrow base; jaw with an\r\naccessory oblong plate.\r\n\r\n_Janellidae_: Central tooth very small, laterals and marginals like\r\n_Achatinellidae_ (_a_).\r\n\r\n_Vaginulidae_: Central, laterals, and marginals unicuspid throughout,\r\non same plan.\r\n\r\n_Onchidiidae_: Rows oblique at the centre, straight near the edges;\r\ncentral strong, tricuspid; laterals and marginals very long, falciform,\r\narched, unicuspid.\r\n\r\n_Auriculidae_: Teeth very small; central narrow, tricuspid on rather a\r\nbroad base; laterals and marginals obscurely tricuspid on a base like\r\n_Succinea_.\r\n\r\n_Limnaeidae_: Jaw composed of one upper and two lateral pieces; central\r\nand lateral teeth resembling those of Helicidae; marginals much\r\npectinated and serriform (Fig. 141, A). In _Ancylus_ proper the teeth\r\nare of a very different type, base narrow, head rather blunt, with\r\nno sharp cusps, teeth similar throughout, except that the marginals\r\nbecome somewhat pectinated (Fig. 141, B); another type more resembles\r\n_Limnaea_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 141.--Portions of the radula of =A=, _Limnaea\r\n  stagnalis_ L., with the central tooth and two first laterals,\r\n  and two of the marginals, very highly, magnified; =B=, _Ancylus\r\n  fluviatilis_ Müll., with two of the marginals very highly\r\n  magnified; =C=, _Physa fontinalis_ L., with central tooth and two\r\n  of the marginals very highly magnified.]\r\n\r\n_Physidae_: Jaw simple, but with a fibrous growth at its upper edge,\r\nwhich may represent an accessory plate; radula with very oblique\r\nrows, central tooth denticulate, laterals and marginals serriform,\r\ncomb-like, with a wing-like appendage at the superior outer edge (Fig.\r\n141, C).\r\n\r\n_Chilinidae_: Central tooth small, cusped on an excavated triangular\r\nbase, marginals five-cusped, with a projection as in _Physa_, laterals\r\ncomb-like, serrations not deep.\r\n\r\n_Amphibolidae_: Central tooth five-cusped on a broad base, central\r\ncusp very large; two laterals only, the first very small, thorn-like,\r\nthe second like the central tooth, but three-cusped; laterals simple,\r\nsabre-shaped.\r\n\r\n=Scaphopoda.=--In the single family (_Dentaliidae_) the radula is\r\nlarge, and quite unlike that of any other group. The central tooth is a\r\nsimple broad plate; the single lateral is strong, arched, and slightly\r\ncusped; the marginal a very large quadrangular plate, quite simple;\r\nformula, 1.1.1.1.1 (Fig. 133, B).\r\n\r\n=Cephalopoda.=--The radula of the Cephalopoda presents no special\r\nfeature of interest. Perhaps the most remarkable fact about it is its\r\nsingular uniformity of structure throughout a large number of genera.\r\nIt is always very small, as compared with the size of the animal, most\r\nof the work being done by the powerful jaws, while the digestive powers\r\nof the stomach are very considerable.\r\n\r\nThe general type of structure is a central tooth, a very few laterals,\r\nand an occasional marginal or two; teeth of very uniform size and shape\r\nthroughout. In the Dibranchiata, marginals are entirely absent, their\r\nplace being always taken, in the Octopoda, by an accessory plate of\r\nvarying shape and size. This plate is generally absent in the Decapoda.\r\nThe central tooth is, in the Octopoda, very strong and characteristic;\r\nin _Eledone_ and _Octopus_ it is five-cusped, central cusp strong; in\r\n_Argonauta_ unicuspid, in _Tremoctopus_ tricuspid. The laterals are\r\nalways three in number, the innermost lateral having a tendency to\r\nassume the form of the central. In _Sepia_ the two inner laterals are\r\nexact reproductions of the central tooth; in _Eledone_, _Sepiola_,\r\n_Loligo_, and _Sepia_, the third lateral is falciform and much the\r\nlargest.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 142.--Portion of the radula of _Octopus\r\n  tetracirrhus_ D. Ch., Naples, × 20.]\r\n\r\nIn _Nautilus_, the only living representative of the Tetrabranchiata,\r\nthere are two sickle-shaped marginals on each side, each of which has\r\na small accessory plate at the base. The two laterals and the central\r\ntooth are small, very similar to one another, unicuspid on a square\r\nbase.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 143.--Alimentary canal of _Helix aspersa_\r\n  L.: _a_, anus; _b.d_, _b.d´_, right and left biliary ducts;\r\n  _b.m_, buccal mass; _c_, crop; _h.g_, hermaphrodite gland; _i_,\r\n  intestine; _i.o_, opening of same from stomach (pyloric orifice);\r\n  _l_, _l´_, right and left lobes of liver; _m_, mouth; _oe_,\r\n  oesophagus; _r_, rectum; _s.d_, salivary duct; _s.g_, salivary\r\n  gland; _st_, stomach; _t_, left tentacle. (After Howes and\r\n  Marshall, slightly modified.)]\r\n\r\n_Salivary glands_ are found in most Glossophora. They occur in one or\r\ntwo pairs on each side of the pharynx and oesophagus, the duct usually\r\nleading forwards and opening into the anterior part of the pharynx\r\n(see Figs. 143, 144). They are exceptionally large in the carnivorous\r\nGasteropoda. In certain genera, _e.g._ _Murex_, _Dolium_, _Cassis_,\r\n_Pleurobranchus_, the secretions of these glands are found to contain\r\na considerable proportion (sometimes as much as 4·25 per cent) of\r\nfree sulphuric acid. This fact was first noticed by Troschel, who,\r\nwhile handling a _Dolium galea_ at Messina, saw the creature spit a\r\njet of saliva upon a marble slab, which immediately produced a brisk\r\neffervescence. A number of the genera thus provided bore through the\r\nshells of other Mollusca and of Echinoderms, to prey upon their soft\r\ntissues, and it is possible that the acid assists in the piercing of\r\nthe shell by converting the hard carbonate of lime into sulphate of\r\nlime, which can easily be removed by the action of the radula.[327] In\r\nthe majority of the Cephalopoda there are two pairs of salivary glands,\r\none lying on each side of the mouth, the other on the middle of the\r\noesophagus.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 144.--Alimentary canal, etc., of _Sepia\r\n  officinalis_ L.: _a_, anus; _b.d_, one of the biliary ducts;\r\n  _b.m_, buccal mass; _c_, coecum; _i_, ink-sac; _i.d_, duct of\r\n  same; _j_, jaws; _l.l_, lobes of the liver; _oe_, oesophagus;\r\n  _p_, pancreatic coeca; _r_, rectum; _s.g_, salivary glands; _st_,\r\n  stomach.

(After Vanstone.)]\r\n\r\n3. _The Oesophagus._--That part of the alimentary canal which lies\r\nbetween the pharynx and the stomach (in Pelecypoda between the mouth\r\nand stomach) is known as the oesophagus. Its exact limits are not easy\r\nto define, since in many cases the tube widens so gradually, while the\r\nmuscular structure of its walls changes so slowly that it is difficult\r\nto say where oesophagus ends and stomach begins. As a rule, the\r\noesophagus is fairly simple in structure, and consists of a straight\r\nand narrow tube. In the Pulmonata and Opisthobranchiata it often widens\r\nout into a ‘crop,’ which appears to serve the purpose of retaining a\r\nquantity of masticated food before it passes on to the stomach. In\r\n_Octopus_ and _Patella_ the crop takes the form of a lobular coecum.\r\nIn the carnivorous Mollusca the oesophagus becomes complicated by\r\nthe existence of a varying number of glands, by the action of which\r\ndigestion appears to begin in some cases before the food reaches the\r\nstomach proper.\r\n\r\n4. _The Stomach._--At the posterior end of the oesophagus lies the\r\nmuscular pouch known as the stomach, in which the digestion of the\r\nfood is principally performed. This organ may be, as in _Limax_, no\r\nmore than a dilatation of the alimentary canal, or it may, as is\r\nusually the case, take the form of a well-marked bag or pocket. The two\r\norifices of the stomach are not always situated at opposite ends; when\r\nthe stomach itself is a simple enlargement of the wall of one side of\r\nthe alimentary canal, the cardiac or entering orifice often becomes\r\napproximated to the orifice of exit (pyloric orifice).\r\n\r\nThe walls of the stomach itself are usually thickened and strengthened\r\nby constrictor muscles. In some Nudibranchs (_Scyllaea_, _Bornella_)\r\nthey are lined on the inside with chitinous teeth. In _Cyclostoma_, and\r\nsome _Bithynia_, _Strombus_, and _Trochus_ there is a free chitinous\r\nstylet within the stomach.[328] In _Melongena_ (Fig. 146) the posterior\r\nend of the oesophagus is provided with a number of hard plate-like\r\nridges, while the stomach is lined with a double row of cuticular\r\nknobs, which are movable on their bases of attachment, and serve the\r\npurpose of triturating food.[329] _Aplysia_ has several hard plates,\r\nset with knobs and spines, and similar organs occur in the Pteropoda.\r\nBut the most formidable organ for the crushing of food is possessed by\r\nthe Bullidae, and particularly by _Scaphander_ (Fig. 145). Here there\r\nis a strong gizzard, consisting of several plates connected by powerful\r\ncartilages, which crush the shells, which are swallowed whole.\r\n\r\nInto the stomach, or into the adjacent portions of the digestive tract,\r\nopen the ducts which connect with the so-called _liver_. The functions\r\nof this important organ have not yet been thoroughly worked out. The\r\nliver is a lobe-shaped gland of a brown-gray or light red colour, which\r\nin the spirally-shelled families usually occupies the greater part of\r\nthe spire. In the Cephalopoda, the two ducts of the liver are covered\r\nby appendages which are usually known as the pancreatic coeca; the\r\nbiliary duct, instead of leading directly into the stomach, passes\r\ninto a very large coecum (see Fig. 144) or expansion of the same,\r\nwhich serves as a reservoir for the biliary secretions. At the point\r\nof connexion between the coecum and stomach is found a valve, which\r\nopens for the issue of the biliary products into the stomach, but\r\ncloses against the entry of food into the coecum. In most Gasteropoda\r\nthe liver consists of two distinct lobes, between which are embedded\r\nthe stomach and part of the intestine. In many Nudibranchiata the liver\r\nbecomes ‘diffused’ or broken up into a number of small diverticula or\r\nglands connecting with the stomach and intestine. The so-called cerata\r\nor dorsal lobes in the Aeolididae are in effect an external liver,\r\nthe removal of which to the outside of the body gives the creature\r\nadditional stomach-room.\r\n\r\n=The Hyaline Stylet.=--In the great majority of bivalves the intestine\r\nis provided with a blind sac, or coecum of varying length. Within\r\nthis is usually lodged a long cylindrical body known as the _hyaline_\r\nor _crystalline stylet_. In a well-developed _Mytilus edulis_ it is\r\nover an inch in length, and in _Mya arenaria_ between two and three\r\ninches. The bladder-like skin of the stylet, as well as its gelatinoid\r\nsubstance, are perfectly transparent. In the Unionidae there is no\r\nblind sac, and the stylet, when present, is in the intestine itself. It\r\nis said to be present or absent indifferently in certain species.\r\n\r\nThe actual function performed by the hyaline stylet is at present a\r\nmatter of conjecture. Haseloff’s experiments on _Mytilus edulis_ tend\r\nto confirm the suggestion of Möbius, that the structure represents\r\na reserve of food material, not specially secreted, but a chemical\r\nmodification of surplus food. He found that under natural conditions\r\nit was constantly present, but that specimens which were starved lost\r\nit in a few days, the more complete the starvation the more thorough\r\nbeing the loss; it reappeared when they were fed again. Schulze, on the\r\nother hand, believes that it serves, in combination with mucus secreted\r\nby the stomach, to protect the intestine against laceration by sharp\r\nparticles introduced with the food. W. Clark found that in _Pholas_ the\r\nstylet is connected with a light yellow corneous plate, and imagined\r\ntherefore that it acts as a sort of spring to work the plate in order\r\nto comminute the food, the two together performing somewhat the\r\nfunction of a gizzard.[330]\r\n\r\n5. and 6. _The Intestine, Rectum, and Anus._--The intestine, the wider\r\nanal end of which is called the rectum, almost invariably makes a bend\r\nforward on leaving the stomach. This is the case in the Cephalopoda,\r\nScaphopoda, and the great majority of Gasteropoda. The exceptions are\r\nthe bilaterally symmetrical Amphineura, in which the anus is terminal,\r\nand many Opisthobranchiata, in which it is sometimes lateral (Fig. 68,\r\np. 159), sometimes dorsal (Fig. 67). The intestine is usually short in\r\ncarnivorous genera, but long and more or less convoluted in those which\r\nare phytophagous. In all cases where a branchial or pulmonary cavity\r\nexists, the anus is situated within it, and thus varies its position\r\naccording to the position of the breathing organ. Thus in _Helix_ it\r\nis far forward on the right side, in _Testacella_, _Vaginula_, and\r\n_Onchidium_ almost terminal, in _Patella_ at the back of the neck,\r\nslightly to the right side (Fig. 64, p. 157).\r\n\r\nIn the rhipidoglossate section of the Diotocardia (_Trochus_,\r\n_Haliotis_, etc.) the rectum passes through the ventricle of the heart,\r\na fact which, taken in conjunction with others, is evidence of their\r\nrelationship to the Pelecypoda.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 147.--Ink-sac of _Sepia_, showing its\r\n  relation to the rectum: _a_, anus; _d_, duct of sac; _i.g_,\r\n  ink-gland; _i.r_, portion of the sac which serves as a reservoir\r\n  for the ink; _o_, orifice of ink-gland; _r_, rectum; _sp_, double\r\n  set of sphincter muscles controlling upper end of duct. (Modified\r\n  from Girod.)]\r\n\r\nIn nearly all Pelecypoda the intestine is very long and convoluted,\r\nbeing sometimes doubled forward over the mouth. Towards its terminal\r\npart it traverses the ventricle of the heart, except in _Ostrea_,\r\n_Anomia_, _Teredo_, and a few more. The anus is always at the posterior\r\nend of the animal, adjacent to and slightly above the adductor muscle.\r\n\r\nAnal glands, which open into the rectum close to the anus, are present\r\nin some Prosobranchiata, _e.g._ _Murex_, _Purpura_. In the Cephalopoda\r\nthe anal gland becomes of considerable size and importance, and is\r\ngenerally known as the ink-sac (Fig. 147); it occurs in all known\r\nliving genera, except _Nautilus_. The ink-sac consists of a large bag\r\ngenerally divided into two portions, in one of which the colouring\r\nmatter is secreted, while the other acts as a reservoir for its\r\nstorage. A long tube connects the bag with the end of the rectum, the\r\nmouth of the tube being controlled, in _Sepia_, by a double set of\r\nsphincter muscles.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =The Kidneys=\r\n\r\nThe kidneys, nephridia,[331] renal or excretory organs, consist\r\ntypically of two symmetrical glands, placed on the dorsal side of\r\nthe body in close connexion with the pericardium. Each kidney opens\r\non the one hand into the mantle cavity, close to the anus (see Fig.\r\n64, p. 157), and on the other, into the pericardium. The venous blood\r\nreturning from the body passes through the vascular walls of the\r\nkidneys, which are largely formed of cells containing uric acid. The\r\nblood thus parts with its impurities before it reaches the breathing\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nThe kidneys are paired in all cases where the branchiae are paired,\r\nand where the heart has two auricles, _i.e._ in the Amphineura, the\r\nDiotocardia (with the exception of the Neritidae), the Pelecypoda,\r\nand all Cephalopoda except _Nautilus_, which has four branchiae,\r\nfour auricles, and four kidneys. In other Gasteropoda only one\r\nkidney survives, corresponding to the left kidney of Zygobranchiate\r\nGasteropods.\r\n\r\nBesides their use as excretory organs the kidneys, in certain groups of\r\nthe Mollusca, stand in very close relation to the genital glands. In\r\nsome of the Amphineura the generative products, instead of possessing\r\na separate external orifice of their own, pass from the genital gland\r\ninto the pericardium and so out through the kidneys (see Fig. 61 C, D,\r\np. 154). In the Diotocardia it is the right kidney alone which serves,\r\nbesides its excretory functions, as a duct for the emission of the\r\ngenerative products, the left kidney being at the same time greatly\r\nreduced in size. Thus in _Patella_ the left nephridium is small, the\r\nright being much larger; both function as excretory organs, but the\r\nright serves as a mode of conveyance for the seminal products as well.\r\nIn certain Pelecypoda (_e.g._ _Yoldia_, _Avicula_, _Modiola_, _Pecten_,\r\n_Spondylus_) the genital glands communicate directly, and with a\r\nsimilar object, with the renal pouch on the same side of the body, but\r\nin the majority of cases the orifices are distinct.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following memoirs will be found useful for further study of this\r\nportion of the subject:--\r\n\r\n   =D.

This fact only tends to emphasise the truth that the shell\r\nand animal are in the closest possible connexion, and that the shell\r\nis a living part of the organism, and is equally sensitive to external\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nA striking instance of the comparative valuelessness of the shell alone\r\nas a primary basis of classification is furnished by the large number\r\nof cases in which a _limpet-shaped_ shell is assumed by genera widely\r\nremoved from one another in cardinal points of organisation. This\r\nform of shell occurs in the common limpet (Patellidae), in _Ancylus_\r\n(Limnaeidae), _Hemitoma_ (Fissurellidae), _Cocculina_ (close to\r\nTrochidae), _Umbrella_ and _Siphonaria_ (Opisthobranchiata), while in\r\nmany other cases the limpet form is nearly approached.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, about three-quarters of the known Mollusca, recent\r\nand fossil, possess a univalve, and about one-fifth a bivalve shell.\r\nIn _Pholas_, and in some species of _Thracia_, there is a small\r\naccessory hinge plate; in the Polyplacophora, or Chitons, the shell\r\nconsists of eight plates (see Fig. 2, p. 8), usually overlapping. A\r\ncertain proportion of the Mollusca have no shell at all. In many of\r\nthese cases the shell has been present in the larva, but is lost in the\r\nadult.\r\n\r\nThe shell may be\r\n\r\n(1) _External_, as in the great majority of both univalves and\r\nbivalves.\r\n\r\n(2) _Partly external_, _partly internal_; _e.g._ _Homalonyx_,\r\n_Hemphillia_, some of the _Naticidae_, _Scutum_, _Acera_, _Aplustrum_\r\n(Figs. 148 and 149).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 148.--_Aplustrum aplustre_ L. Mauritius,\r\n  showing the partly internal shell (=S=); =F=, foot; =LL=,\r\n  cephalic lappets; =TT=, double set of tentacles. (After Quoy and\r\n  Gaimard.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 149.--_Sigaretus laevigatus_ Lam., showing\r\n  shell partially immersed in the foot; =F=, anterior prolongation\r\n  of the foot. (After Souleyet.)]\r\n\r\n(3) _Internal_; _e.g._ _Philine_, _Gastropteron_, _Pleurobranchus_,\r\n_Aplysia_, _Limax_, _Arion_, _Hyalimax_, _Parmacella_, _Lamellaria_,\r\n_Cryptochiton_, and, among bivalves, _Chlamydoconcha_.\r\n\r\n(4) _Absent_; _e.g._ all _Nudibranchiata_ and _Aplacophora_, many\r\n_Cephalopoda_, a few land Mollusca, _e.g._ all _Onchidiidae_,\r\n_Philomycus_, and _Vaginula_.\r\n\r\n=The Univalve Shell.=--In univalve Mollusca the normal form of the\r\nshell is an elongated cone twisted into a spiral form round an axis,\r\nthe spiral ascending to the left. Probably the original form of the\r\nshell was a simple cone, which covered the vital parts like a tent.\r\nAs these parts tended to increase in size, their position on the\r\ndorsal side of the animal caused them gradually to fall over, drawing\r\nthe shell with them. The result of these two forces combined, the\r\nincreasing size of the visceral hump, and its tendency to pull the\r\nshell over with it, probably resulted in the conversion of the conical\r\ninto the spiral shell, which gradually came to envelop the whole\r\nanimal. Where the visceral hump, instead of increasing in size, became\r\nflattened, the conical shape of the shell may have been modified into a\r\nsimple elliptical plate (_e.g._ _Limax_), the nucleus representing the\r\napex of the cone. In extreme cases even this plate dwindles to a few\r\ncalcareous granules, or disappears altogether (_Arion_, _Vaginula_).\r\n\r\n=Varieties of the Spiral.=--Almost every conceivable modification of\r\nthe spiral occurs, from the type represented by _Gena_, _Haliotis_,\r\n_Sigaretus_, and _Lamellaria_, in which the spire is practically\r\nconfined to the few apical whorls, with the body-whorl inordinately\r\nlarge in proportion, to a multispiral form like _Terebra_, with about\r\ntwenty whorls, very gradually increasing in size.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 150.--Examples of shells with =A=, a\r\n  flattened spire (_Polygyratia_); =B=, a globose spire (_Natica_);\r\n  =C=, a greatly produced spire (_Terebra_).]\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the spire is more or less obliquely coiled round the axis,\r\neach whorl being partially covered, and therefore hidden by, its\r\nimmediate successor, while the size of the whorls, and therefore the\r\ndiameter of the spire as a whole, increases somewhat rapidly. The\r\neffect of this is to produce the elevated spire, the shell of six to\r\nten whorls, and the wide aperture, of the normal type of mollusc, the\r\nwhelk, snail, periwinkle, etc.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the coil of the whorls, instead of being oblique,\r\ntends to become horizontal to the axis, and thus we have another series\r\nof gradations of form, from the excessively produced spire of _Terebra_\r\nto the flattened disc of _Planorbis_, _Polygyratia_, _Euomphalus_, and\r\n_Ammonites_. The shell of many species of _Conus_ practically belongs\r\nto the latter type, each whorl folding so closely over its predecessor\r\nthat the spiral nature of the shell is not perceived until it is looked\r\nat at right angles to the spire.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 151.--Examples of shells with disconnected\r\n  whorls; =A=, _Cyathopoma cornu_ Mf., Philippines; =B=,\r\n  _Cylindrella hystrix_ Wright, Cuba. (Both × 4.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 152.--Example of a shell whose apical whorls\r\n  alone are coiled, and the remainder produced in a regular curve.\r\n  (_Cyclosurus Mariei_ Morel., Mayotte.)]\r\n\r\nIn some cases the regularly spiral form is kept, but the whorls are\r\ncompletely disconnected; _e.g._ some _Scalaria_, _Spirula_; among\r\nfossil Cephalopoda, _Gyroceras_, _Crioceras_, and _Ancyloceras_; and,\r\namong recent land Mollusca, _Cylindrella hystrix_ and _Cyathopoma\r\ncornu_ (Fig. 151). Sometimes only the last whorl becomes disconnected\r\nfrom the others, as in _Rhiostoma_ (see Fig. 180, p. 266),\r\n_Teinostoma_, and in the fossil _Ophidioceras_ and _Macroscaphites_.\r\nSometimes, again, not more than one or two whorls at the apex are\r\nspirally coiled, and the rest of the shell is simply produced or\r\ncoiled in an exceedingly irregular manner, _e.g._ _Cyclosurus_,\r\n_Lituites_, _Orygoceras_, _Siliquaria_ (Fig. 153), _Vermetus_. In\r\n_Coecum_ (Fig. 170, p. 260) the spiral part is entirely lost, and the\r\nshell becomes simply a cylinder. In a few cases the last whorl is\r\ncoiled irregularly backwards, and is brought up to the apex, so that\r\nthe animal in crawling must carry the shell with the spire downwards,\r\nas in _Anostoma_ (Fig. 154), _Opisthostoma_ (Fig. 208, p. 309),\r\n_Strophostoma_, and _Hypselostoma_ (Fig. 202 A, p. 302).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 153.--_Siliquaria anguina_ Lam., showing\r\n  scalariform coil of upper whorls and irregular extension of the\r\n  lower.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 154.--_Anostoma globulosum_ Lam., Brazil.\r\n  (After P. Fischer.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 155.--Various forms of the internal plate in\r\n  _Capulidae_: =A=, _Calyptraea_ (_Mitrularia_) _equestris_ Lam.,\r\n  E. Indies; =B=, _Crucibulum scutellatum_ Gray, Panama; =C=,\r\n  _Ergaea plana_ Ad., and Reeve, Japan; =D=, _Galerus chinensis_\r\n  L., Britain; =E=, _Crepipatella dilatata_ Lam., Callao; =F=,\r\n  _Trochita maculata_ Quoy, N. Zealand; =G=, _Crepidula fornicata_\r\n  Lam., N. America.]\r\n\r\nSome genera of the _Capulidae_, in which the shell is of a broadly\r\nconical form or with scarcely any spire, develop an internal plate\r\nor process which serves the purpose of keeping the animal within the\r\nshell, and does the work of a strong attachment muscle. In _Mitrularia_\r\nthis process takes the form of a raised horse-shoe; in _Crucibulum_ it\r\nis cup-shaped, with the edge free all round; in _Galerus_, _Ergaea_,\r\n_Crepipatella_, and _Trochita_ we get a series of changes, in which\r\nthe edge of the cup adheres to the interior of the shell, and then\r\ngradually flattens into a plate. In _Crepidula_ proper this plate\r\nbecomes a regular partition, covering a considerable portion of the\r\ninterior (Fig. 155 G). _Hipponyx_ secretes a thin calcareous plate on\r\nthe ventral surface of the foot, which intervenes like an operculum\r\nbetween the animal and the substance to which it adheres.\r\n\r\n_Sinistral, or Left-handed Shells._--The vast majority of univalve\r\nspiral shells are normally _dextral_, _i.e._ when held spire uppermost,\r\nwith the aperture towards the observer, the aperture is to the right\r\nof the axis of the spire. If we imagine such a shell to be a spiral\r\nstaircase, as we ascended it we should always have the axis of the\r\nspire to our left.\r\n\r\nSinistral or ‘reversed’ forms are not altogether uncommon, and may be\r\ngrouped under four classes:--\r\n\r\n(1) Cases in which the _genus is_ normally sinistral; (2) cases in\r\nwhich the _genus_ is _normally dextral_, but _certain species_ are\r\n_normally sinistral_; (3) cases in which the shell is _indifferently\r\ndextral or sinistral_; (4) cases in which _both genus and species_ are\r\n_normally dextral_, and a sinistral form is an _abnormal monstrosity_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 156.--_Fulgur perversum_ L., Florida. × ½.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 157.--Illustration of the gradation of forms\r\n  in _Ampullaria_ between a dextral (=A=) and an ultra-dextral\r\n  species (=F=).]\r\n\r\nIn all cases of sinistral monstrosity, and all in which a sinistral and\r\ndextral form are interchangeable (sections 3 and 4 above), the position\r\nof the apertures of the internal organs appears to be relatively\r\naffected, _i.e._ the body is sinistral, as well as the shell. This has\r\nbeen proved to be the case in all specimens hitherto examined, and may\r\ntherefore be assumed for the rest. The same uniformity, however, does\r\nnot hold good in all cases for genera and species normally sinistral\r\n(sections 1 and 2). As a rule, the anal and genital apertures are, in\r\nthese instances also, to the left, but not always. In _Spirialis_,\r\n_Limacina_, _Meladomus_, and _Lanistes_ the shell is sinistral, but\r\nthe animal is dextral. This apparent anomaly has been most ingeniously\r\nexplained by Simroth, Von Ihering, and Pelseneer. The shell, in all\r\nthese cases, is not really sinistral, but _ultra-dextral_. Imagine\r\nthe whorls of a dextral species capable of being flattened, as in a\r\n_Planorbis_, and continue the process, still pushing, as it were, the\r\nspire downwards until it occupies the place of the original umbilicus,\r\nbecoming turned completely ‘inside out,’ and we have the whole\r\nexplanation of these puzzling forms. The animal remains dextral, the\r\nshell has become sinistral. A convincing proof of the truth of this\r\nis furnished by the operculum. It is well known that the twist of the\r\noperculum varies with that of the shell; when the shell is dextral, the\r\noperculum is sinistral, with its nucleus near the columella, and _vice\r\nversâ_. In these ultra-dextral shells, however, where it is simply the\r\nmethod of the enrolment of the spire that comes in question, and not\r\nthe formation of the whorls themselves, the operculum remains sinistral\r\non the apparently sinistral shell.\r\n\r\nThe reverse case to this, when the shell is dextral but the orifices\r\nsinistral, is instanced by the two fresh-water genera _Pompholyx_ (from\r\nN. America), and _Choanomphalus_ (L. Baikal). A similar transition in\r\nthe enrolment of the whorls may be confidently assumed to have taken\r\nplace, and the shells are styled _ultra-sinistral_.\r\n\r\nYet another variation remains, in which the embryonic form is\r\nsinistral, but the adult shell dextral, the former remaining across the\r\nnucleus of the spire. This is the case with _Odostomia_, _Eulimella_,\r\n_Turbonilla_, and _Mathilda_, all belonging to the Prosobranchiata,\r\nwith _Actaeon_, _Tornatina_, and _Actaeonina_ among the Opisthobranchs,\r\nand _Melampus_ alone among Pulmonates.\r\n\r\n=Monstrosities of the Shell.=--Abnormal growths of the shell constantly\r\noccur, some of them being scarcely noticeable, except by a practised\r\neye, others of a more serious nature, involving an entire change in\r\nthe normal aspect of the creature. _Scalariform_ monstrosities are\r\noccasionally met with, especially in _Helix_ and _Planorbis_, when\r\nthe whorls become unnaturally elevated, and sometimes quite disjoined\r\nfrom one another; _carinated_ monstrosities develop a keel on a whorl\r\nusually smooth; _acuminated_ monstrosities have the spire produced to\r\nan extreme length (Fig. 158); _sinistral_ monstrosities (see above)\r\nhave the spire reversed: dwarfs and giants, as in our own race, are\r\noccasionally noticed among a crowd of individuals.\r\n\r\nMore serious forms of monstrosity are those which occur in individual\r\ncases. Mr. S. P. Woodward once observed[332] a specimen of an adult\r\n_Helix aspersa_ with a second, half-grown individual fixed to its\r\nspire, and partly embedded in the suture of the body whorl. The younger\r\nsnail had died during its first hibernation, as was shown by the\r\nepiphragm remaining in the aperture, and its neighbour, not being able\r\nto get free of the incubus, partially enveloped it in the course of\r\nits growth. In the British Museum two _Littorina littorea_ have become\r\nentangled in a somewhat similar way (Fig. 160 B), possibly as a result\r\nof embryonic fusion. Double apertures are not uncommon[333] in the\r\nmore produced land-shells, such as _Cylindrella_ and _Clausilia_ (Fig.\r\n160 A). In the Pickering collection was a _Helix hortensis_ which had\r\ncrawled into a nutshell when young, and, growing too large to escape,\r\nhad to carry about this decidedly extra shell to the end of its days.\r\nA monstrosity of the cornucopia form, in which the whorls are uncoiled\r\nalmost throughout, is of exceedingly rare occurrence (Fig. 161).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 158.--Monstrosities of _Neptunea antiqua_ L.,\r\n  and _Buccinum undatum_ L., with a greatly produced spire (from\r\n  specimens in the Brit. Mus.).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 159.--Monstrosities of _Littorina rudis_ Mat,\r\n  The Fleet, Weymouth. (After Sykes.)]\r\n\r\nSome decades ago ingenious Frenchmen amused themselves by creating\r\nartificial monstrosities. _H. aspersa_ was taken from its shell, by\r\ncarefully breaking it away, and then introduced into another shell of\r\nsimilar size (_H. nemoralis_, _vermiculata_, or _pisana_). At the end\r\nof several days attachment to the columella took place, and then growth\r\nbegan, the new shell becoming soldered to the old, and the spiral\r\npart of the animal being protected by a thin calcareous envelope. A\r\ngrowth of from one to two whorls took place under these conditions.\r\nThe individuals so treated were always sordid and lethargic, but they\r\nbred, and naturally produced a normal _aspersa_ offspring.[334] In the\r\nBritish Museum there is a specimen of one of these artificial unions of\r\na _Helix_ with the shell of a _Limnaea stagnalis_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 160.--Monstrosities with two apertures: =A=,\r\n  _Cylindrella agnesiana_ C. B. Ad., Jamaica; =B=, _Littorina\r\n  littorea_ (from specimens in the British Museum).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 161.--Cornucopia-shaped monstrosity of _Helix\r\n  aspersa_, from Ilfracombe. (British Museum.)]\r\n\r\n=Composition of the Shell.=--The shell is mainly composed of pure\r\ncarbonate of lime, with a very slight proportion of phosphate of lime,\r\nand an organic base allied to chitin, known as _conchiolin_. The\r\nproportion of carbonate of lime is known to vary from about 99 p.c. in\r\n_Strombus_ to about 89 p.c. in _Turritella_. Nearly 1 p.c. of phosphate\r\nof lime has been obtained from the shell of _Helix nemoralis_, and\r\nnearly 2 p.c. from that of _Ostrea virginica_. The conchiolin forms a\r\nsort of membranous framework for the shell; it soon disappears in dead\r\nspecimens, leaving the shell much more brittle than it was when alive.\r\nCarbonate of magnesia has also been detected, to the extent of ·12 p.c.\r\nin _Telescopium_ and ·48 p.c. in _Neptunea antiqua_. A trace of silica\r\nhas also occasionally been found.\r\n\r\nWhen the shell exhibits a crystalline formation, the carbonate of lime\r\nmay take the form either of _calcite_ or _aragonite_. The calcite\r\ncrystals are rhombohedral, optically uniaxal, and cleave easily, while\r\nthe aragonite cleave badly, belong to the rhombic system, and are\r\nharder and denser, and optically biaxal. Both classes of crystal may\r\noccur in the same shell.\r\n\r\nTwo main views have been held with regard to the formation and\r\nstructure of the shell--(1) that of Bowerbank and Carpenter, that the\r\nshell is an organic formation, growing by interstitial deposit, in the\r\nsame manner as the teeth and bones of the higher animals; (2) that\r\nof Réaumur, Eisig, and most modern writers, that the shell is of the\r\nnature of an excretion, deposited like a cuticle on the outside of the\r\nskin, being formed simply of a number of calcareous particles held\r\ntogether by a kind of ‘animal glue.’ Leydig’s view is that the shell\r\nof the Monotocardia is a secretion of the epithelium, but that in the\r\nPulmonata it originates within the skin itself, and afterwards becomes\r\nfree.[335]\r\n\r\nAccording to Carpenter, when a fragment of any recent shell is\r\ndecalcified by being placed in dilute acid, a definite animal basis\r\nremains, often so fine as to be no more than a membranous film, but\r\nsometimes consisting of an aggregation of ‘cells’ with perfectly\r\ndefinite forms. He accordingly divides all shell structure into\r\n_cellular_ and _membranous_, according to the characteristics of the\r\nanimal basis. Cellular structure is comparatively rare; it occurs most\r\nnotably in _Pinna_, where the shell is composed of a vast multitude of\r\ntolerably regular hexagonal prisms (Fig. 162 B). Membranous structure\r\ncomprises all forms of shell which do not present a cellular tissue.\r\nCarpenter held that the membrane itself was at one time a constituent\r\npart of the mantle of the mollusc, the carbonate of lime being secreted\r\nin minute ‘cells’ on its surface, and afterwards spreading over the\r\nsubjacent membrane through the bursting of the cells.\r\n\r\nThe iridescence of _nacreous_ shells is due to a peculiar lineation\r\nof their surface, which can be readily detected by a lens. According\r\nto Brewster, the iridescence is due to the alternation of layers of\r\ngranular carbonate of lime and of a very thin organic membrane, the\r\nlayers very slightly undulating. Carpenter, on the other hand, holds\r\nthat it depends upon the disposition of a single membranous layer\r\nin folds or plaits, which lie more or less obliquely to the general\r\nsurface, so that their edges show as lines. The nacreous type of\r\nshell occurs largely among those Mollusca which, from other details\r\nin their organisation, are known to represent very ancient forms\r\n(_e.g._ _Nucula_, _Avicula_, _Trigonia_, _Nautilus_). It is also the\r\nleast permanent, and thus in some strata we find that only casts of\r\nthe nacreous shells remain, while those of different constitution are\r\npreserved entire.\r\n\r\n_Porcellanous_ shells (of which the great majority of Gasteropoda are\r\ninstances) usually consist of three layers, each of which is composed\r\nof a number of adjacent plates, like cards on edge. The inclination of\r\nthe plates in the different layers varies, but that of the plates in\r\nthe inner and outer layer is frequently the same, thus if the plates\r\nare transverse in the middle stratum, they are longitudinal in the\r\ninner and outer strata, and, if longitudinal in the middle, they are\r\ntransverse in the other two. Not uncommonly (Fig. 163 B) other layers\r\noccur. In bivalves the disposition and nature of the layers is much\r\nmore varied.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 162.--=A=, Section of shell of _Unio_:\r\n  _a_, periostracal layer; _b_, prismatic layer; _c_, nacreous\r\n  layer. =B=, Horizontal section of shell of _Pinna_, showing the\r\n  hexagonal prisms.]\r\n\r\nIn _Unio_ the periostracal or uppermost layer is very thin; beneath\r\nthis is a prismatic layer of no great depth, while the whole remainder\r\nof the shell is nacreous (Fig. 162 A). Many bivalves show traces of\r\ntubular structure, while in the Veneridae the formation and character\r\nof the layers approaches closely to that of the Gasteropoda. Further\r\ndetails may be gathered from Carpenter’s researches.[336]\r\n\r\n=Formation of Shell.=[337]--The mantle _margin_ is the principal agent\r\nin the deposition of shell. It is true that if the shell be fractured\r\nat any point, the hole will be repaired, thus showing that every part\r\nof the mantle is furnished with shell-depositing cells, but such new\r\ndeposits are devoid of colour and of periostracum, and no observation\r\nseems to have been made with regard to the layers of which they are\r\ncomposed. As a rule the mantle, except at its margin, only serves to\r\nthicken the innermost layer of shell.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the carbonate of lime, of which the shell is mainly\r\ncomposed, is separated from the blood by the epithelial cells of the\r\nmantle margin, and takes the crystalline or granular form as it hardens\r\non exposure after deposition. The three layers of a porcellanous shell\r\nare deposited successively, and the extreme edge of the mouth, when\r\nshell is forming, will contain only one layer, the outermost; a little\r\nfurther in, two layers appear, and further still, three. The pigment\r\ncells which colour the surface are situated at the front edge of the\r\nmantle margin.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 163.--Sections of shells. =A=, _Conus_:\r\n  _a_, outer layer; _b_, middle prismatic layer, with obliquely\r\n  intersecting laminae above and below; _c_, inner layer. =B=,\r\n  _Oliva_: _a_, outer layer; _b_, layer of crossed and curved\r\n  laminae; _c_, prismatic layer, succeeded by layer of laminae at\r\n  right angles to one another; _d_, inner layer. =C=, _Cypraea_:\r\n  _a_, outer layer; _b_, middle layer; _c_, inner layer.]\r\n\r\nShelly matter is deposited, and probably secreted, not only by the\r\nmantle, but also in some genera by the foot. This is certainly the case\r\nin _Cymbium_, _Oliva_, _Ancillaria_, _Cassis_, _Distortio_, and others,\r\nin several of which the foot is so large that the shell appears to be\r\nquite immersed in it.[338]\r\n\r\nThe deposition of shell is not continuous. Rest periods occur, during\r\nwhich the function is dormant; these periods are marked off on the\r\nedge of the shell, and are known as _lines of growth_. In some cases\r\n(_Murex_, _Triton_, _Ranella_), the rest period is marked by a decisive\r\nthickening of the lip, which persists on the surface of the shell as\r\nwhat is called a _varix_ (see p. 263).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 164.--_Murex tenuispina_ L., Ceylon. × ⅔.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 165.--_Neritina longispina_ Récl., Mauritius.\r\n  (Operculum removed.)]\r\n\r\nThe various details of sculpture on the exterior surface of the shell,\r\nthe striae, ribs, nodules, imbrications, spines, and other forms\r\nof ornamentation are all the product of similar and corresponding\r\nirregularities in the mantle margin, and have all been originally\r\nsituated at the edge of the lip. Spines, _e.g._ those of _Murex_ and\r\n_Pteroceras_, are first formed as a hollow thorn, cleft down its lower\r\nside, and are afterwards filled in with solid matter as the mantle\r\nedge withdraws. What purpose is served by the extreme elaboration\r\nof these spiny processes in some cases, can hardly be considered as\r\nsatisfactorily ascertained. Possibly they are a form of sculptural\r\ndevelopment which is, in the main, protective, and secures to its\r\nowners immunity from the attacks of predatory fishes.\r\n\r\n‘Attached’ genera (e.g. _Chama_, _Spondylus_) when living on smooth\r\nsurfaces have a flat shell, but when affixed to coral and other uneven\r\nsurfaces they become very irregular in shape. The sculpture of the base\r\non which they rest is often reproduced in these ‘attached’ shells,\r\nnot only on the lower, but also on the upper valve, the growing edge\r\nof which rests on the uneven surface of the base. Oysters attached to\r\nthe branches of the mangrove frequently display a central convex rib,\r\nmodelled on the shape of the branch, from which the plaits of sculpture\r\nradiate, while specimens fixed to the smooth trunk have no such rib.\r\n_Crepidula_, a genus which is in the habit of attaching itself to other\r\nshells, varies in sculpture according to that of its host. Sometimes\r\nthe fact may be detected that a specimen has lived on a ribbed shell\r\nwhen young, and on a smooth one when old, or _vice versâ_. A new genus\r\nwas actually founded by Brown for a _Capulus_ which had acquired ribs\r\nthrough adhesion to a _Pecten_. A specimen of _Hinnites giganteus_ in\r\nthe British Museum must at one period of its growth have adhered to\r\na surface on which was a Serpula, the impression of which is plainly\r\nreproduced on the upper valve of the _Hinnites_.[339]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 166.--A specimen of _Anomia ephippium_ L.,\r\n  Weymouth, taken upon _Pecten maximus_, the sculpture of which\r\n  is reproduced on the upper valve of the _Anomia_, and even on a\r\n  young _Anomia_ attached to the larger specimen.]\r\n\r\n=Growth of the Shell.=--Nothing very definite is known with regard to\r\nthe rate of growth of the shell in marine Mollusca. Under favourable\r\nconditions, however, certain species are known to increase very\r\nrapidly, especially if the food supply be abundant, and if there\r\nis no inconvenient crowding of individuals. Petit de la Saussaye\r\nmentions[340] the case of a ship which sailed from Marseilles for\r\nthe west coast of Africa, after being fitted with an entirely new\r\nbottom. On arriving at its destination, the vessel spent 68 days in\r\nthe Gambia River, and took 86 days on its homeward voyage. On being\r\ncleaned immediately on its return to Marseilles, an _Avicula_ 78 mm.\r\nand an _Ostrea_ 95 mm. long (both being species peculiar to W. Africa)\r\nwere taken from its keel. These specimens had therefore attained this\r\ngrowth in at most 154 days, for at the period of their first attachment\r\nthey are known to be exceedingly minute. P. Fischer relates[341] that\r\nin 1862 a buoy, newly cleaned and painted, was placed in the basin\r\nat Arcachon. In less than a year after, it was found to be covered\r\nwith thousands of very large _Mytilus edulis_, 100 mm. × 48 mm., the\r\nordinary size on the adjoining banks being only about 50 to 60 × 30 mm.\r\n\r\nSome observations have already been recorded (p. 40) on the growth of\r\n_Helix aspersa_. In the summer of 1858, which was very dry, especially\r\nin the south of France, the young Helices born that year were still\r\nvery small in August. About the end of that month abundant rain came\r\non, and in four or five days young _H. variabilis_, _H. pisana_, and\r\n_H. aspersa_, eating without cessation, as if to make up for lost\r\ntime, grew more than a centimetre of shell. The lip of a young _H.\r\narbustorum_ has been observed to have grown, at the end of the first\r\nweek in the season’s growth, 3 mm., at the end of the second week, 6·25\r\nmm., the third, 11·5 mm., and the fourth 12·5 mm., with a finished\r\nlip.[342]\r\n\r\nCareful observation has shown that in the growth of the shell of\r\n_Helix aspersa_ the periostracum is first produced; it is covered with\r\nhyaline globules, 10–12 mm. in diameter, which persist even in the\r\noldest shells. Calcareous matter is deposited on the internal face of\r\nthe new periostracum, at some distance from the margin. It is secreted\r\nby a white zone or band of cells bounding the entire breadth of the\r\nmantle as applied to the peristome. Immediately behind the white zone\r\nare a series of pigment cells which not only give the shell its colour\r\nbut complete the calcification of the shelly matter laid down by the\r\nwhite zone. When the animal has attained its full growth and the lip\r\nis finished off, the white band and the periostracum cells completely\r\ndisappear, and only such cells persist as contribute to the internal\r\nthickening of the shell. Shell growth, in this species, is very rapid.\r\nIf a portion of the pulmonary sac is laid bare, by removing a fragment\r\nof shell, at the end of 1½ or 2 hours there may be detected a delicate\r\norganic membrane covering the hole, and strewn with crystals of\r\ncarbonate of lime. This thickens with great rapidity, and soon fills\r\nup the hole with solid matter. For two consecutive months an animal,\r\ndeprived of food, has been known to reproduce this membrane daily after\r\nits removal every morning.[343] Prof. Schiedt has found that oysters,\r\nif deprived of the right valve and exposed to the light, not only\r\ndevelop brown pigment over the whole exposed surface of mantle and\r\nbranchiae, but actually succeed in part in reproducing the valve and\r\nhinge.[344]\r\n\r\n_Deposit of Additional Layers of Shell._--Mollusca possess the power\r\nof thickening the interior of the shell, by the deposit of successive\r\nlayers. This is frequently done in self-defence against the attacks\r\nof boring Mollusca, sponges, and worms. Cases may often be noticed of\r\n_Ostrea_, _Spondylus_, and other sedentary molluscs, which, unable\r\nto escape the gradual assaults of their foes, have provided against\r\nthem by the deposit of fresh shelly matter. A somewhat similar plan is\r\nadopted to provide against intrusion by way of the aperture. Pearls\r\nare, in many cases, the result of shell deposition upon the eggs or\r\neven the body of some intrusive parasite (_Distoma_, _Filaria_, etc.),\r\nand are, in some countries, artificially produced by the introduction\r\nof fragments of sand, metal, etc., into living _Unio_ and _Anodonta_.\r\nLittle joss images are made in India and China, the nacre on which is\r\nproduced by thrusting them inside living Unionidae.\r\n\r\nA specimen of _Helix rosacea_, in the British Museum, into whose shell\r\na piece of grass somehow became introduced, has partitioned it off\r\nby the formation of a sort of shelly tunnel extending throughout its\r\nentire length (Fig. 167).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 167.--A specimen of _Helix rosacea_ Müll.,\r\n  Cape of Good Hope, into which a piece of grass has by some means\r\n  become introduced. The animal has protected itself by covering\r\n  the grass with a shelly layer. (From a specimen in the British\r\n  Museum.)]\r\n\r\n=Absorption of Internal Portions.=--Certain genera have the remarkable\r\nproperty of absorbing, when they become adult, the internal portions\r\nof the whorls and the greater part of the columellar axis. The\r\neffect of this is to make the shell, when the process is complete,\r\nno longer a spiral but a more or less produced cone, and it is found\r\nthat in such cases the viscera of the spire lose their spiral form,\r\nand take the shape of the cavity in which they lie. Amongst the\r\ngenera in which this singular process takes place are _Nerita_,[345]\r\n_Olivella_, and _Cypraea_ amongst marine forms, and nearly the whole\r\nof the Auriculidae[346] (Fig. 168). _Conus_ reduces the internal\r\nsubdivisions of the spire to extreme thinness. It is noticeable that\r\nthese genera are all of considerable thickness of shell, and it is\r\nperhaps the result of the whole energy of the animal being directed to\r\nthe formation of its external protection that the internal walls of the\r\nspire become atrophied and eventually disappear.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 168.--_Auricula Judae_ Lam., showing the\r\n  disappearance of the partitions of the whorls, which are\r\n  represented by dotted lines. (After Fischer.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 169.--=A=, Decollated (adult) form, and =B=,\r\n  perfect (young) form of _Cylindrella nobilior_ Ad., Jamaica; the\r\n  dotted line shows where decollation takes place.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 170.--Development of _Coecum_: =A=, showing\r\n  the gradual formation of septa; _a_, apex; _ap_, aperture; _ss_,\r\n  first septum; _s´s´_, second septum. (After de Folin.) =B=, Adult\r\n  form of _C. eburneum_ Ad., Panama. × 8.]\r\n\r\n=Decollation.=--In certain genera, when the shell becomes adult, the\r\nanimal ceases to occupy the upper whorls, which accordingly die and\r\ndrop off, the orifice at the top having meanwhile been closed by a\r\nshelly deposit. Such shells are termed _decollated_. In some land\r\ngenera decollation is the rule, _e.g._ in _Cylindrella_ (Fig. 169),\r\n_Eucalodium_, and _Rumina_, as well as in many species of the brackish\r\nwater genera, _Truncatella_, _Cerithidea_, and _Quoyia_. _Stenogyra_\r\n(_Rumina_) _decollata_, a common shell in the south of Europe, has\r\nbeen noticed to bang its upper whorls violently against some hard\r\nsubstance, as if to get rid of them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 171.--Four stages in the growth of\r\n  _Fissurella_, showing how the spire gradually disappears and\r\n  the marginal slit becomes an apical hole, =A=, =B=, =C=, highly\r\n  magnified, =D=, natural size. (After Boutan.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 172.--Three stages in the growth of _Cypraea\r\n  exanthema_ L. (From specimens taken at Panama.)]\r\n\r\n=Special Points in the Growth of Certain Genera.=--In the young of\r\n_Coecum_ the apex is at first spiral, but as growth proceeds and the\r\nlong tube begins to form, a septum is produced at the base of the apex,\r\nwhich soon drops off. Soon afterwards, a second septum forms a little\r\nfarther down, and a second piece drops off, leaving the shell in the\r\nnormal cylindrical form of the adult (Fig. 170). The development of\r\n_Fissurella_ is of extreme interest. In an early stage it possesses\r\na spiral shell, with a slit on the margin of the outer lip of the\r\nlast whorl. As growth advances, shelly matter is deposited on both\r\nmargins, which results in the slit becoming a hole and the spire a\r\nmere callosity, until at last they appear to coalesce in the apex of\r\nthe adult shell (Fig. 171). The singular formations of _Magilus_ and\r\n_Rhizochilus_ have already been described (pp. 75, 76). _Cypraea_, in\r\nthe young stage, is a thin spiral shell with a conspicuous apex. As\r\ngrowth proceeds, the surface of the whorls, which are nearly enveloped\r\nby two large lobes of the mantle, becomes overlaid with new layers\r\nof shelly matter, until eventually the spire becomes embedded, and\r\nultimately disappears from view (Fig. 172).\r\n\r\n_Patella_, when young, has a nautiloid shell (see Fig. 45, p. 134),\r\nbut it is a remarkable fact that we are entirely ignorant, in this\r\ncommonest of molluscs, of the transition stages which convert the\r\nnautiloid into the familiar conical shell. The young shell of\r\n_Pteroceras_ is deceptively unlike the adult, and is entirely devoid\r\nof the finger-like processes which are so characteristic of the genus\r\n(chap. xiv.).\r\n\r\nAmong the bivalve Mollusca, _Anomia_ in a young stage is not to be\r\ndistinguished from Ostrea. Soon a small sinus appears on the ventral\r\nmargin, which gradually deepens and, as the shell grows round it, forms\r\na hole for the byssus, eventually becoming fixed beneath the umbones\r\n(see Fig. 173). In _Teredo_ the two valves of the shell proper, which\r\nis very small, become lodged in a long calcareous tube or cylinder,\r\nwhich is generally open at both ends (see chap. xvi.). In _Aspergillum_\r\na somewhat similar cylinder is developed, but the valves are soldered\r\nto the tube, and form a part of it, the tube itself being furnished, at\r\nthe anterior end, with a disc, which is perforated with holes like the\r\nrose of a watering-pot. In _Clavagella_ the left valve alone becomes\r\nsoldered to the tube, while the right valve is free within it (see\r\nchap. xvi.). _Fistulana_ encloses the whole of its shell in a long\r\ntapering tube, which is not at any point adherent to the shell.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 173.--Development of the byssus or the\r\n  plug-hole in _Anomia_. (After Morse.)]\r\n\r\n=Terms employed to denote various Parts of the Univalve Shell.=--The\r\n_apex_ is the extreme top of the spire, and generally consists of\r\nthe embryonic shell, which may often be recognised by its entire\r\nwant of sculpture. When the embryonic shell happens to be large, the\r\napex is often mammillated, _e.g._ in _Fusus_, _Neptunea_, and some\r\n_Turbinella_; in the _Pyramidellidae_ it is sinistral.\r\n\r\nThe _suture_ is the line of junction between any two successive\r\nwhorls. It may be deep, and even channelled, or very shallow, as in\r\nFig. 150 B (p. 246).\r\n\r\nThe _spire_ is the whole series of whorls except the last or _body\r\nwhorl_. A _whorl_ is a single revolution of the spiral cone round\r\nthe axis. The spire may be _subulate_ (as in _Terebra_, Fig. 150 C),\r\n_turreted_ (_Scalaria_), _depressed_ (_Polygyratia_, Fig. 150 A),\r\n_conical_ (_Trochus_), _globose_ (_Ampullaria_, _Natica_, Fig. 150\r\nB), with almost all conceivable gradations between these types. The\r\nnumber of whorls is best counted by placing the shell mouth downwards,\r\nand reckoning _one_ for every suture that occurs between the extreme\r\nanterior point of the shell and the apex.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 174.--Illustrating the technical terms\r\n  applied to the various parts of a univalve shell.]\r\n\r\nThe _mouth_ or aperture may be (_a_) entire, as in _Helix_, _Natica_,\r\n_Ampullaria_, when its _peristome_ or margin is not interrupted by any\r\nnotch or canal, or (_b_) prolonged at its anterior and sometimes also\r\nat its posterior end into a _canal_. The _anterior canal_ serves as a\r\nprotection to the siphon,[347] the _posterior canal_ is mainly anal\r\nin function, and corresponds, in part, to the hole of _Fissurella_,\r\nthe slit in _Pleurotoma_ and _Emarginula_, and the row of holes in\r\n_Haliotis_. The mouth presents every variety of shape, from the perfect\r\ncircle in _Cyclostoma_ and _Trochus_, to the narrow and prolonged slit\r\nin _Conus_ and _Oliva_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 175.--Anal slit in _Pleurotoma_.]\r\n\r\nThe right margin of the mouth (the left, in sinistral shells) is\r\ntermed the _outer lip_ or _labrum_, the left margin the _inner lip_,\r\n_labium_, or _columella lip_.[348] In young shells the outer lip\r\nis usually thin and unfinished, while in the adult it is generally\r\nthickened into a rib, or furnished with more or less prominent teeth,\r\nor given an inward or outward curve. In some genera, especially the\r\nStrombidae, the outer lip of the adult develops long finger-like\r\nprocesses, which sometimes attain an extraordinary size (chap.\r\nxiv.). As growth proceeds, these marginal teeth and ribs are either\r\ndissolved and disappear, or are permanently incorporated, in the shape\r\nof _varices_, with the framework of the shell. Some shells, _e.g._\r\n_Natica_, _Turritella_, _Actaeon_, have a permanently unfinished\r\nouter lip, even in the adult stage. The columella lip varies in shape\r\nwith the mouth as a whole; thus it may be straight, as in _Conus_, or\r\nexcavated, as in _Sigaretus_, _Struthiolaria_, and _Bulla_. Frequently\r\nit is continued by part of the body whorl, as in _Ficula_, _Dolium_,\r\nand _Fasciolaria_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 176.--_Solarium perspectivum_ Lam., from the\r\n  under side.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 177.--Section of _Turbinella pyrum_ L.,\r\n  showing the plicae on the columella and the growth of successive\r\n  whorls.]\r\n\r\nThe folds or plaits on the columella, which are often characteristic\r\nof the genus or even family (_e.g._ Fasciolariidae, Mitridae,\r\nTurbinellidae) are not merely external, but continue down the whole\r\nspire (see Fig. 177, which also shows how successive fresh growths have\r\nthickened the columella).\r\n\r\nThe whorls may be wound in a spiral, which is either hollow, as in\r\n_Solarium_, or quite compact, as in _Oliva_, _Terebra_, _Cypraea_,\r\nwith every possible intermediate grade. This concavity, which\r\nvaries in depth and width, is known as the _umbilicus_, and shells\r\nare accordingly spoken of as _deeply_ (_e.g._ most Trochidae and\r\nNaticidae), _narrowly_ (_e.g._ _Lacuna_, _Littorina_), or _widely_\r\n(_e.g._ _Solarium_) _umbilicated_. When the spiral is quite flat, as in\r\n_Planorbis_ and some _Helix_, the umbilicus vanishes entirely. Shells\r\nin which the whorls are so compactly coiled on an ascending spiral that\r\nthere is no umbilicus, are termed _imperforate_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 178.--The slit in =A=, _Hemitoma_, =B=,\r\n  _Emarginula_, =C=, _Macroschisma_, =D=, _Craniopsis_, =E=,\r\n  _Puncturella_, =F=, _Fissurella_.]\r\n\r\n_The Slit._--Many shells are furnished with a slit in the last whorl,\r\nwhich opens, in most cases, on the outer lip, and is sometimes of\r\nconsiderable depth, at others a mere notch. In the patelliform shells\r\nit is always in front of the apex. The function of the slit appears to\r\nbe mainly anal, the excretory products being thus allowed to escape\r\nby a passage of their own, without soiling the clean water taken in\r\nby the branchiae. The posterior canal of some Gasteropoda probably\r\nperforms a similar function. In the adult _Fissurella_ the slit\r\nbecomes an apical hole (see Fig. 178 F), in the allied genera it is\r\neither immediately in front of the spire (_Puncturella_), or half-way\r\nbetween the spire and the anterior margin (_Rimula_), or on the margin\r\nand well marked (_Emarginula_), or a mere indentation of the margin\r\n(_Hemitoma_). In _Pleurotomaria_ it is exceptionally long, and is well\r\nmarked in _Bellerophon_, _Schismope_, _Scissurella_, _Murchisonia_, and\r\n_Pleurotoma_ (where it is sutural). In _Haliotis_ and _Polytremaria_\r\nit is replaced by a series of holes, which are closed up as the\r\nanimal grows past them. Some of these holes (at least in _Haliotis_)\r\ncertainly serve the purpose of admitting water to the branchiae, while\r\nothers are anal. In _Trochotoma_ there are only two holes, united by a\r\nnarrow fissure.\r\n\r\n_The Tubed Land Operculates._--A group of the Cyclophoridae, which is\r\nrestricted to Further India and the great Malay Islands, has developed\r\na remarkable _sutural tube_ on the exterior of the last whorl, near\r\nthe aperture, A similar tube, but more obscure, exists in _Alycaeus_.\r\nSeveral stages in the development of this tube may be noticed,\r\nbeginning with the elevation of part of the peristome into a simple\r\nirregular shelly plate, which is continued, first into a short, and\r\nthen into a long tube, which becomes soldered to the shell; finally,\r\nthe tube becomes free, and the anterior part of the last whorl is\r\ndisconnected from the spire (Fig. 180 A-D).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 179.--The slit in =A=, _Bellerophon_, =B=,\r\n  _Pleurotomaria_, =C=, _Schismope_, =D=, _Polytremaria_, =E=,\r\n  _Haliotis_ (not drawn to scale).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 180.--Development of the tube in the\r\n  tube operculates: =A=, _Pterocycus rupestris_ Bens.; =B=,\r\n  _Opisthoporus birostris_ Pfr.; =C=, _Spiraculum travancoricum_\r\n  Bedd.; =D=, _Rhiostoma Housei_ Pfr.]\r\n\r\nIt is singular that the tube does not appear to be of any use to\r\nthe animal, since its internal extremity, in the complete form, is\r\nclosed, and does not communicate with the interior of the whorl. It\r\nmay be presumed, however, that in origin the tube served as a means of\r\nconveying air to the animal when the operculum was closed. The holes in\r\nthe peristome of _Pupina_, _Cataulus_, and _Anostoma_ (Fig. 154) may be\r\ncompared.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 181.--_Eburna spirata_ Lam., E. Indies. =F=,\r\n  foot; =OP=, operculum; =P=, penis; =S=, siphon; =T=, tentacles,\r\n  with eyes at their base. (After Souleyet.)]\r\n\r\n=The Operculum.=--The operculum is a cuticular development of a\r\ngroup of cells situated on the dorsal side of the foot, exactly over\r\nthe terminal point of the fibres of the columellar muscle. It is so\r\nsituated that in crawling it is generally carried free of the shell,\r\nsometimes at the extreme upper end of the foot, more usually somewhat\r\nnearer to the shell (Fig. 181). In _Pterocyclus_ it is pushed back into\r\nthe umbilicus when the animal is in motion.\r\n\r\nThe operculum is present in nearly all land, fresh-water, and marine\r\nProsobranchiata, absent in all Opisthobranchiata in the adult state,\r\nexcept _Actaeon_, and in all Pulmonata, except _Amphibola_. It has\r\nbeen lost in the following marine Prosobranchiata: many Cancellariidae\r\nand Conidae, _Oliva_ (though present in _Olivella_ and _Ancilla_),\r\nHarpidae, Marginellidae, _Voluta_ proper (though present in _V.\r\nmusica_), nearly all Mitridae, Cypraeidae, Doliidae, Ianthinidae; and,\r\nof land genera, in Proserpinidae. It is evident, therefore, that its\r\npresence or absence is of limited value in classification. In some\r\nspecies of _Ampullaria_ and _Natica_ it is horny, in others shelly.\r\nDall found that in a number of specimens of _Volutharpa ampullacea_,\r\n15 p.c. had opercula, 10 p.c. traces of the operculigenous area, but\r\nno operculum, the rest no trace of either. Monstrosities of _Buccinum\r\nundatum_ sometimes occur, which have two, or in rare case three\r\nopercula.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the operculum exactly fits the mouth of the shell. But\r\nin cases where the mouth is very large (_e.g._ _Conus_, _Strombus_,\r\n_Concholepas_, some _Bullia_), it only covers a very small portion and\r\nis quite inadequate as a protection (Fig. 62, p. 155). Again, when the\r\nshell has assumed a more or less limpet-shaped form, and habitually\r\nadheres to flat surfaces without much occasion for locomotion, the\r\noperculum becomes degraded and is probably on the way to being lost\r\naltogether. This is the case with _Navicella_ (a modified _Nerita_, see\r\nFig. 13, p. 17), _Concholepas_ (a modified _Purpura_), _Sigaretus_ (a\r\nmodified _Natica_). Probably the more completely patelliform shells of\r\n_Crepidula_, _Haliotis_, _Fissurella_, and _Patella_ have reached the\r\nstage at which the operculum has been lost entirely. In _Navicella_,\r\nbesides becoming degraded, the operculum has actually become partly\r\ninternal, and apparently serves the purpose of separating the viscera\r\nfrom the upper part of the foot, something like the shelly plate in\r\n_Crepidula_. This explains why the operculum in this genus is polished\r\non both sides.[349]\r\n\r\nSome authors have imagined that the operculum is homologous (_a_)\r\nto the second valve in Pelecypoda, (_b_) to the byssus. It differs,\r\nhowever, morphologically from the former in the essential point of not\r\nbeing produced by the mantle, and from the latter in not being produced\r\nby a special gland.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n      Turbo         Turbo    Livona    Ampullaria    Natica\r\n   Sarmaticus)   (Callopoma)\r\n\r\n  FIG. 182.--Various forms of opercula.]\r\n\r\nAs regards shape and formation, the operculum has usually a more or\r\nless well-marked nucleus which may be central (_e.g._ _Livona_),\r\nsub-central (_Ampullaria_), lateral (_Purpura_), or terminal\r\n(_Pyrula_). As a rule, both the inner and outer surfaces are fairly\r\nflat, but in _Torinia_, _Cyathopoma_, and _Pterocyclus_ the outer\r\nsurface is elevated and conically spiral, in some _Turbo_ (_e.g._\r\n_Sarmaticus_) it is covered with raised tubercles resembling coral,\r\nwhile in others (_e.g._ _Callopoma_) it is scored with a deep trench.\r\n_Aulopoma_, a land genus peculiar to Ceylon, has a paucispiral\r\noperculum with hollow whorls, deceptively like a _Planorbis_; it fits\r\nover the aperture instead of into it. In _Livona_ and most Trochidae\r\nthe operculum is cartilaginous and multispiral. In _Strombus_ it is\r\nnarrow, curved, and often serrated like a leaf on one of the edges; in\r\n_Conus_ it is narrowly oblong and rather featureless; in _Littorina_,\r\npaucispiral and always cartilaginous. In many cases (_e.g._\r\n_Paludina_) there is no true spiral form, but the striae are concentric\r\nto a nearly central nucleus, and thus give the appearance of a spiral.\r\nThe evolution of the operculum in _Navicella_ from _Nerita_ has already\r\nbeen illustrated (p. 10). _Neritopsis_ has a very remarkable operculum,\r\nthe striated appendage of which locks behind the columella of the\r\nshell, like the tooth in the opercula of the Neritidae.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Pyrula    Purpura    Littorina    Aulopoma    Torinia\r\n                                       × 3/2        × 3\r\n\r\n    Neritopsis    Strombus    Conus\r\n                                × 2\r\n\r\n  FIG. 183.--Various forms of opercula.]\r\n\r\n=Terms employed to denote various parts of the Bivalve Shell.=--The\r\n_umbo_, or _beak_, is the apex of the hollow cone, of which each valve\r\nmay be regarded as consisting. This apex is usually more or less\r\ntwisted: it is markedly spiral in _Isocardia_, _Diceras_, some _Chama_,\r\nand especially _Requienia_, while in _Pecten_, _Lepton_, and others the\r\nspiral is altogether absent. As a rule the umbones point _forward_,\r\n_i.e._ towards the anterior end of the shell. In _Donax_, _Nucula_, and\r\n_Trigonia_, however, they point backward. The umbones are generally\r\nmore or less approximated, but in _Arca_ they are widely separated.\r\n\r\nAn _equilateral_ shell is one in which the umbones are more or less\r\ncentral with regard to its anterior and posterior portion, while in\r\nan _inequilateral_ shell the umbones are much nearer one end than the\r\nother. On the other hand, _equivalve_ and _inequivalve_ are terms used\r\nto express the relation of the two valves to one another as a whole.\r\nThus nearly all bivalve shells are more or less inequilateral, but a\r\ncomparatively small proportion are inequivalve.\r\n\r\nThe _dorsal margin_ is adjacent to, the _ventral margin_ opposite to,\r\nthe umbones. The _anterior_ and _posterior margins_ are respectively\r\nthe front and hinder edges of the shell.\r\n\r\nThe muscles which serve to close the valves leave _impressions_ on the\r\ninner surface of each valve. These, when both muscles are present, are\r\nknown as the _anterior_ and _posterior adductor impressions_. The\r\nimpression produced by the muscular edge of the mantle, which curves\r\ndownwards and backwards from the anterior adductor impression, is known\r\nas the _pallial line_. In shells with only one muscle it is represented\r\nby an irregular row of small marks, or disappears altogether\r\n(_Ostrea_). The _pallial sinus_ is produced by the muscles which\r\nretract the siphons, and is most marked in those genera in which the\r\nmuscles are powerful and the siphons large (_e.g._ _Tellina_, _Mya_).\r\nIt is entirely absent in genera possessing no retractile siphons.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 184.--Left valve of _Venus gnidia_ L.: =A=,\r\n  anterior, =B=, posterior, =C=, dorsal, =D=, ventral margin, =AB=,\r\n  length, =CD=, breadth of shell.\r\n\r\n  _a.m_, anterior; _p.m_, posterior adductor muscle; _p_, pallial\r\n  line; _p.s_, pallial sinus; _l_, ligament; _lu_, lunule; _u_,\r\n  umbo; _c_, cardinal teeth; _a.l_, anterior lateral tooth; _p.l_,\r\n  posterior lateral tooth.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 185.--Right valve of _Lucina tigerina_ L.:\r\n  =A=, anterior, =B=, posterior, =C=, dorsal, =D=, ventral margin;\r\n  =AB=, length, =CD=, breadth of shell.\r\n\r\n  _a.m_, anterior; _p.m_, posterior adductor muscles; _p_, pallial\r\n  line; _l_, ligament; _u_, umbo; _c_, cardinal teeth; _a.l_,\r\n  _p.l_, anterior and posterior lateral tooth.]\r\n\r\n_Right and Left Valve._--The simplest way of distinguishing the\r\nvalves as right and left is to hold the shell in such a way that the\r\nsiphons point towards the observer, and the mouth away from him; in\r\nthis position the valve to the right is called the _right valve_, and\r\nthe valve to the left the _left valve_. If, however, the animal is\r\nnot present, it may be remembered that the ligament is nearly always\r\n_behind_ the beaks, and that the beaks, as a rule, point _forward_,\r\nthus the right and left valves can generally be named by observation\r\nof the beaks and ligament. When the ligament is median to the valves\r\n(_e.g._ _Ostrea_, _Pecten_), and the beaks are not curved, the\r\nvalves may be recognised by noting the fact that the impression of\r\nthe adductor muscle (in these cases always single) is nearer to the\r\nposterior than to the anterior side. In a similar way the pallial\r\nimpression, which only forms a sinus on the posterior side, furnishes a\r\nguide to the valves of _Donax_, in which the beaks point backward, and\r\nof _Tellina_, in which the beaks are frequently central.\r\n\r\nIn the fixed inequivalves (_e.g._ _Chama_) it is sometimes the right,\r\nsometimes the left valve which is undermost, but the fixed valve,\r\nwhether right or left, is always deep, and the free valve flat.\r\n_Ostrea_ and _Anomia_ are always fixed by the _left_ valve.\r\n\r\nThe _lunule_ is a well-marked area _in front of_ and close to the\r\numbones, usually more or less heart-shaped, and limited by a ridge.\r\nGenerally it is shallow, but sometimes, as in _Dosinia_, _Opis_, and\r\nsome _Cardium_, deeply impressed. A corresponding area _behind_ the\r\numbones, enclosing the ligament, is called the _escutcheon_ (Fig. 186),\r\nbut it seldom occurs.\r\n\r\nThe _ligament_ is a more or less elastic band, which unites the two\r\nvalves along a line adjacent to the umbones. As a rule, the greater\r\npart of the ligament is external to the shell, but it may be entirely\r\ninternal. It is placed, normally, _behind_ the umbones, but in a few\r\ncases, when the hinge line is very long (_Arca_, _Pectunculus_),\r\nit extends in front of them as well. The edges of the valves, when\r\nthe ligament is mainly external, are more or less excavated for its\r\nreception. When internal it is generally contained in a groove or\r\nspoon-shaped pit, known as the _fossette_ (compare Fig. 187).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 186.--_Venus subrostrata_ Lam.: _es_,\r\n  escutcheon; _li_, ligament; _lu_, lunule; _u_, _u_, umbones.]\r\n\r\nThe ligament consists of two distinct parts, which may occur together\r\nor separately, the external, or _ligament proper_, and the internal, or\r\n_cartilage_. Only the external portion can be seen when the valves are\r\nclosed. As a rule, the two portions are intimately connected with one\r\nanother, the ligament folding over the cartilage, but in some cases,\r\n_e.g._ _Mya_, _Mactra_, where the cartilage is lodged within the hinge,\r\nthey are completely disconnected (Fig. 187).\r\n\r\nIn _Pecten_ the external ligament is very thin, and runs along the\r\ndorsal margin, while the internal ligament is large, solid, and\r\nsituated in a shallow pit. In _Perna_, where the hinge is toothless,\r\nthe ligament is folded into a number of transverse ridges, which fit\r\ninto corresponding grooves in the shell.\r\n\r\nThe ligament proper is _inelastic_ and insoluble in caustic potash.\r\nThe cartilage is very elastic, composed of parallel fibres, slightly\r\niridescent, and soluble in caustic potash.\r\n\r\nThe operation of the ligament--using the word as including the whole\r\nligamental process--is in opposition to that of the adductor muscles.\r\nWhen the latter close the valves, they compress the ligament, an action\r\nwhich its elasticity resists: thus its operation tends in part towards\r\nkeeping the valves open. But when ligament and cartilage are both fully\r\ndeveloped, they work in opposition to one another, the ligament, by its\r\nresistance to compression, preventing any straining of the adductor\r\nmuscles when the valves are open, and the cartilage, for the same\r\nreason, preventing the ventral margins of the shell from closing too\r\nrapidly upon one another when the valves are being shut.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 187.--Hinge of =A=, right valve, and =B=,\r\n  left valve of _Mulinia edulis_ King; _ca_, cardinals; _l.a_,\r\n  anterior laterals; _l.p_, posterior laterals; _f_, fossette; _c_,\r\n  cartilage; _l_, ligament.]\r\n\r\n_The Hinge._--The valves of _Pelecypoda_ are generally articulated,\r\nbelow the umbones, by a _hinge_ which is furnished, in the majority of\r\ncases, with interlocking teeth, small pits or depressions in each valve\r\ncorresponding to the teeth in the other. The teeth are distinguished\r\nas _cardinal_, or those immediately below the umbo, and _lateral_,\r\nor those to either side of the cardinals, the latter being also\r\ndistinguished as _anterior_ and _posterior laterals_, according as they\r\nare before or behind the umbo (Fig. 184). In shells which are tolerably\r\nequilateral there is no difficulty in distinguishing between cardinal\r\nand lateral teeth. But when they are very inequilateral, the whole\r\nhinge may share in the inequality of growth, and an anterior lateral\r\nmay be thrown backward and simulate a cardinal, or a cardinal may be\r\nthrown backward and simulate a posterior lateral (_e.g._ _Cardita_,\r\n_Unio_, Fig. 188). In many _Chama_ the cardinals are pushed up into\r\nthe umbo and become a mere ridge, while the strong anterior lateral\r\nbecomes nearly central and simulates a cardinal.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 188.--Hinges of =A=, _Cardita semiorbiculata_\r\n  Brug., and =B=, _Unio rectus_ Lam., showing how, in inequilateral\r\n  shells, the lateral teeth tend to shift their position. _a.m_,\r\n  anterior adductor, _p.m_, posterior adductor muscle; _c_, _c_,\r\n  cardinal teeth; _p.l_, posterior lateral teeth; _l_, ligament.]\r\n\r\nSome bivalves, _e.g._ _Anodonta_, _Ostrea_, _Pedum_, many _Mytilus_,\r\nhave no hinge teeth at all, in others the laterals are wanting\r\n(_Psammobia_, _Diplodonta_). In the Arcadae the hinge consists of a\r\nnumber of very similar denticles, which are often serrated like the\r\nteeth of a comb (Fig. 189).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 189.--The hinge in _Arcadae_: =A=, _Nacula\r\n  Loringi_ Ang. × 4/3; =B=, _Arca granosa_ L.; _u.a_, umbonal area.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 190.--=A=, _Tridacna scapha_ Lam.; =B=,\r\n  _Cardium enode_ Sowb., showing the interlocking of the ventral\r\n  margins.]\r\n\r\nHinge-teeth are probably, in origin, derived from the crenulations or\r\nribbings of the surface of the shell, the upper ends of which impinge\r\nupon the dorsal margin and mark it in a way which is quite recognisable\r\nwhen the shell is thin. Similar crenulations, resulting in interlocking\r\nof the valves, are not uncommon upon the ventral margin in certain\r\ngenera (Fig. 190). The mechanical effect of these continued riblets,\r\nwhen fitted together on the opposing valves, would be to prevent the\r\nvalves sliding upon one another while closing, or after being closed.\r\nThus there would be a probability of their surviving, even after the\r\nribbing had disappeared from the surface of the shell, the increased\r\nstrength given by the hinge compensating for, and making it possible to\r\ndo without, the extra strength supplied by the ribs. It is therefore\r\npossible that the teeth of the Nuculidae and Arcadae, which have no\r\ndistinction between cardinals and laterals, represent a very ancient\r\ntype, from which have been evolved the various forms of hinge in which\r\ncardinals and laterals are distinguished. Even in some forms of Arcadae\r\n(comp. _Pectunculus_) we get a hint how the transverse teeth of the\r\ntypical _Arca_ may have become transformed into the longitudinal tooth\r\nof the normal lateral.[350]\r\n\r\nThe developed hinge-teeth, then, ensure the opening of the valves in\r\none direction; they also secure their accurate closure upon one another\r\nin exactly the same plane. Exposed shells and gaping siphons matter\r\nlittle to animals which are protected by their burrowing propensities,\r\nbut to those which live in material which can be easily penetrated\r\nby their foes, it must be of advantage to be able to buckle their\r\narmour absolutely tight. The edentulous hinge of _Anodonta_\r\nis a degeneration from a dentate type, which retains its teeth (in\r\n_Unio_, etc.) when subject to the jar of rapid streams, but tends\r\nto lose them in the stiller waters of canals, lakes, and ponds.\r\n\r\n_Other processes in the bivalve shell._--In _Anatina_ each umbo is\r\nfissured and strengthened on the inside by a kind of umbonal plate\r\nwhich carries the ligament. Some forms of _Liligna_ develop a strong\r\ninternal umbonal rib, which serves as a buttress to strengthen the\r\nshell. In _Pholas_, the so-called falciform process serves as a point\r\nof attachment for the muscles of the foot and viscera. There is no\r\nligament or hinge-teeth, the place of the latter being taken by the\r\nanterior adductor muscle, which is attached to the hinge-plate, the\r\nlatter being reflected back into the shell.\r\n\r\nIn _Septifer_ the anterior adductor muscle is carried on a sort of\r\nshelf or _myophore_, and in _Cucullaea_ the posterior adductor is\r\npartly raised on a similar and very prominent formation.\r\n\r\n_Length and breadth_ of bivalve shells is variously measured. Most\r\nauthorities measure _length_, or ‘antero-posterior diameter,’ by a\r\nstraight line drawn from the extreme anterior to the extreme posterior\r\nmargin, and _breadth_ by a similar line, drawn from the umbones to a\r\npoint, not very clearly marked, on the opposite ventral margin (see\r\nFigs. 184 and 185). Others, less correctly, reverse these terms.\r\n_Thickness_ is measured by the extreme distance of the opposite faces\r\nof the closed valves. As a rule, the length exceeds, and often greatly\r\nexceeds, the thickness, but in a few cases--_e.g._ the _Cardissa_\r\nsection of _Cardium_--this is reversed.\r\n\r\n_The periostracum._--Nearly all shells are covered, at some period of\r\ntheir growth, by a _periostracum_,[351] or surface skin, which serves\r\nthe purpose of protecting the shell against the destructive effects of\r\nthe chemical action set up by water or air. It also, in some cases (see\r\np. 258), acts as a kind of base upon which the shell is deposited. In\r\nold shells it is commonly worn away, especially at those parts which\r\nare likely to become abraded.\r\n\r\nThe form and composition of the periostracum varies greatly. Sometimes\r\n(_e.g._ _Oliva_) it is a mere transparent film, at others (_Zonites_)\r\nit is transparent, but stout and solid. It is corneous in _Solenomya_,\r\ncovered with fine hairs in many _Helicidae_, in _Conus_, _Velutina_,\r\nand _Cantharus_ it is thick, fibrous, and persistent; in _Trichotropis_\r\nand some _Triton_ it is furnished with long bristles on a thick ground\r\n(Fig. 191). In fresh-water shells it is usually rather thick, in order\r\nto protect the shell from the erosive powers of certain kinds of water.\r\nIn some cases (_Mya_, _Anatina_) the periostracum is continued over the\r\nsiphons, so as to form a protection throughout their whole length.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 191.--_Triton olearium_ L., Mediterranean,\r\n  an example of a shell with a stout and hairy periostracum. × ½.]\r\n\r\n_Erosion._--The fresh-water Mollusca generally, and marine mollusca in\r\na few rare cases (_Purpura_, _Littorina_) are subject to _erosion_,\r\nor decay in the shell substance. In univalves erosion usually sets\r\nin near the apex (Fig. 192), where the life of the shell may be\r\nregarded as weakest, and in bivalves near the umbones. It is commonest\r\nin old shells, and rarely occurs in the very young. So long as the\r\nperiostracum is present to protect the shell, erosion cannot set in,\r\nbut when once it has been removed the shell is liable to the chemical\r\nchanges set up in its substance by water. There is abundant evidence\r\nto show that erosion is caused by pollution of water. Out of many\r\ninstances one must suffice. In a certain stream near Boston, U.S.,\r\nnumbers of Mollusca occurred, the shells of which were very perfect and\r\nfree from disease. Some little way down stream an alkaline manufactory\r\ndrained its refuse into the water. At and below this point for some\r\ndistance every shell was more or less eroded, most of them seriously.\r\nFarther down, when the alkali refuse became diluted away, the shells\r\nretained their normal condition.[352]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 192.--Example of an eroded fresh-water shell\r\n  (_Melania confusa_ Dohrn, Ceylon).]\r\n\r\nA small percentage of lime in the water appears to produce erosion. The\r\nresult of some experiments by G. W. Shrubsole, in the investigation of\r\nthis point, may be tabulated as follows:[353]--\r\n\r\n         Water from             Lime present        Result\r\n                                per gall.\r\n\r\n    River Dee, near Chester     3·00 grs.     acted strongly on shells\r\n    Wrexham                     4·00 grs.       „      „         „\r\n    River Dee, near Llanderyel  0·53 grs.       „      „         „\r\n    Trent Canal                 8·33 grs.     no action          „\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n    GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF LAND AND FRESH-WATER MOLLUSCA--THE\r\n            PALAEARCTIC, ORIENTAL, AND AUSTRALASIAN REGIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca afford specially valuable evidence on problems of\r\ngeographical distribution. This fact is largely due to their extreme\r\nsusceptibility to any change in the conditions of life. Genera which\r\nare accustomed to live in a certain temperature and on certain food,\r\ncannot sustain life if the temperature falls or rises beyond certain\r\nlimits, or if the required food be not forthcoming. There is therefore\r\na marked contrast between the Mollusca of the tropics and of the\r\ntemperate zones, while different regions in the same latitude, whether\r\nwithin or without the tropics, often show great diversity in their\r\nfauna. Every region is thus _characterised_ by its Mollusca. The\r\nMollusca, for instance, of Australia or of South Africa characterise\r\nthose countries quite as much as do the kangaroo and the emu, the\r\nhartebeest and the ostrich; there is nothing like them anywhere else in\r\nthe world. In the Greater Antilles the Mollusca stand out beyond all\r\nother forms of life as characteristic of the islands as a whole, and of\r\neach separate island in particular.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of the land and fresh-water Mollusca must\r\nbe considered quite apart from that of the marine Mollusca. The sea\r\noffers no such serious barriers to the spread of the latter as the land\r\ndoes to the spread of the former. If we were to journey to the Azores,\r\nand turn our attention to the land-snails, we should find them almost\r\nwholly peculiar, while amongst the sea-shells we should recognise many\r\nas occurring also on our southern coasts, and few that were different\r\nfrom those of the Mediterranean. The marine Mollusca of the Sandwich\r\nIslands, in spite of the enormous intervening distance, are not very\r\ndifferent from those of Natal, but the land Mollusca of the two\r\ncountries are as widely different as is possible to imagine.\r\n\r\nLand Mollusca are, as has been remarked, fettered to the soil.\r\nQuadrupeds, birds, fishes, and reptiles are provided with organs of\r\nmotion which enable them to overpass barriers of various kinds. Even\r\nplants, although themselves incapable of motion, may be conveyed in\r\nevery direction by means of seeds, which are either wafted by the wind\r\nor adhere to the skin of animals. But the Mollusca have no such regular\r\nmeans of transport, and are, in a large number of instances, limited to\r\ndistricts of a certain character of soil, or producing certain kinds of\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nThe localisation, both of genera and species, occurs all over the\r\nworld. The genus _Achatinella_, which is peculiar to the Sandwich\r\nIslands, is found there in a profusion of species. It lives in the\r\nmountain valleys which radiate from the central ridge of each island,\r\nand each valley is characterised by its own peculiar set of species.\r\nThe great carnivorous _Glandina_ is restricted to Central America and\r\nthe adjacent parts of the two continents, with one or two species in\r\nSouthern Europe. _Bulimus_ proper is restricted to South America;\r\n_Achatina_ to Africa south of the Sahara; _Tornatellina_ to the\r\nPacific Islands; _Cochlostyla_ to the Philippines; _Cylindrella_ and\r\n_Bulimulus_ are peculiar to the New World; _Buliminus_, _Nanina_,\r\n_Scarabus_, and _Cassidula_ to the Old.\r\n\r\nExtreme cases of this restriction of habitat sometimes occur. Thus\r\n_Limnaea involuta_ is found only in a single small mountain tarn in\r\nIreland; _Clausilia scalaris_ along a narrow strip of limestone in\r\nMalta; _Strophia nana_ is confined to a few square rods on an island\r\nthat is itself a mere dot in the Caribbean Sea; the genus _Camptonyx_\r\noccurs only in the neighbourhood of Mt. Girnar, in Gujerat; and\r\n_Lantzia_ in moss on the top of a mountain in Bourbon.\r\n\r\nAttempts to colonise snails in strange localities have usually resulted\r\nin failure, especially when the attempt has involved serious changes\r\nof environment. The common _Cochlicella acuta_ of our coasts resists\r\nall endeavours to establish it beyond a certain distance from the\r\nsea. Snails brought from the Riviera and placed under almost similar\r\nconditions of climate on our own southern coasts have lived for a\r\nwhile, but have very rarely taken permanent root. Mr. H. W. Kew[354]\r\nhas collected a good many of these attempts to acclimatise species,\r\nthe general success of which seems to depend almost entirely on a\r\nrestoration of the old conditions of life.\r\n\r\nAt the same time there are certain species which exhibit a curiously\r\nopposite tendency, and which seem capable of flourishing in almost\r\nany part of the world, and under the most varied surroundings. Our\r\nown common garden snail (_Helix aspersa_) is a striking instance of\r\nthis adaptability to new conditions. It has been established, by art\r\nor by accident, in Nova Scotia, Maine, South Carolina, New Orleans,\r\nCalifornia, Mexico city, Cuba, Hayti, Cayenne, Brazil, Valparaiso,\r\nCape Town, the Azores, St. Helena, Mauritius, Loyalty Islands, and\r\nAustralia. The great _Achatina fulica_ of East Africa has been\r\nestablished first in Mauritius, and from thence has been carried to\r\nthe Seychelles and Calcutta. _Helix lactea_, a common Mediterranean\r\nspecies, has been carried to Teneriffe and Montevideo; _Helix\r\nsimilaris_, whose fatherland is Eastern Asia, has been transported to\r\nMauritius, Bourbon, West Africa, West Indies, Brazil, and Australia;\r\n_Ennea bicolor_ (Eastern Asia) to India, Bourbon, Mauritius, West\r\nIndies; _Stenogyra decollata_ (Mediterranean basin) to South Carolina;\r\n_S. Goodallii_ (West Indies) to British pineries; _Helix Hortensis_ to\r\nNew Jersey. Seven common English species (_Limax gagates_, _Hyalinia\r\ncellaria_, _H. alliaria_, _Helix aspersa_, _H. pulchella_, _Pupa\r\numbilicata_) have become naturalised in St. Helena,[355] and as many as\r\nnineteen in Australia.[356]\r\n\r\nCases of artificial transport of this kind are readily detected; they\r\nfollow the lines of trade. The snails themselves or their ova have\r\nbeen accidentally enclosed with plants or mould, or have adhered\r\nto packing-cases, or to hay and grass used in packing. Thus they\r\nconstitute no disturbance to the general rule of the persistent\r\nlocalisation of species and genera, and there is little fear that the\r\nevidence which the geographical distribution of the Mollusca brings to\r\nbear upon the general problems of distribution will be confused by any\r\nintermixture of fauna naturally distinct.\r\n\r\n_Land Mollusca: Barriers to Dispersal._--The chief natural barriers\r\nto dispersal are extremes of temperature, the sea, mountain ranges,\r\nand deserts. Rivers, however large, seem of little effect in checking\r\ndispersal. There is no appreciable difference between the land Mollusca\r\nnorth and south of the Ganges, or north and south of the Amazon. Living\r\nsnails, or their ova, are no doubt transported from one bank to another\r\non floating débris of various kinds. The barrier offered by the sea is\r\nobvious, and at first sight appears insurmountable; but the facts with\r\nregard to oceanic groups of islands like the Azores and Canaries (see\r\np. 297) show that even a stretch of salt water many hundred miles in\r\nbreadth may be ineffectual in preventing the dispersal of Mollusca.\r\n\r\nMountain ranges, provided they are too high to be scaled, and too\r\nlong to be turned in flank, offer a far more effective barrier than\r\nthe sea. Every thousand feet upward means a fall of so many degrees\r\nin the mean temperature, and a change, more or less marked, in the\r\ncharacter of the vegetation. There is generally, too, a considerable\r\ndifference in the nature of the climate on the two sides of a great\r\nmountain range, one side being often arid and cold, the other rainy and\r\nwarm. The combined effect of these influences is, as a rule, decisive\r\nagainst the dispersal of Mollusca. Thus the Helices of California are\r\nalmost entirely peculiar; one or two intruders from states farther east\r\nhave succeeded in threading their way through the deep valleys into\r\nthe Pacific provinces, but not a single genuine Californian species\r\nhas been able to scale the heights of the Cascade Mountains. The land\r\nMollusca of India are numbered by hundreds; not one penetrates north\r\nof the Himalayas. According to Mr. Nevill,[357] the change from the\r\nIndo-Malayan to the so-called European molluscan fauna at the northern\r\nwatershed of the Kashmir valley is most abrupt and distinct; in two\r\ndays’ march northward, every species is different. Ranges of inferior\r\naltitude, such as the Pyrenees, the Carpathians, or the Alleghanies,\r\nmay be turned in flank as well as scaled, and we find no such marked\r\ncontrast between the Mollusca on their opposite sides.\r\n\r\nThe most effective barrier of all, however, is a desert. Its scorching\r\nheat, combined with the absence of water and of vegetable life, check\r\ndispersal as nothing else can. The distribution of the Mollusca of the\r\nPalaearctic Region is an excellent instance of this. Their southern\r\nlimit is the great desert which stretches, with scarcely a break,\r\nfrom the west coast of Africa to the extreme east coast of Asia. The\r\nMediterranean offers no effectual barrier; shells of southern Europe\r\nare found in profusion in Morocco, Tunis, and Egypt, while all through\r\nSiberia to the extreme of Kamschatka the same types, and even the same\r\nspecies, of Mollusca occur.\r\n\r\nA detailed examination of the means, other than voluntary, by which\r\nMollusca are transported from one place to another hardly comes within\r\nthe scope of this work. Ocean currents, rivers, floods, cyclonic\r\nstorms of wind, birds, and even beetles and frogs, play a part, more\r\nor less considerable, in carrying living Mollusca or their ova, either\r\nseparately or in connexion with floating débris of every kind, to a\r\ndistance from their native home. Accidental locomotion, of one or\r\nother of these kinds, combined with the well-known tenacity of life\r\nin many species (p. 37), may have contributed to enlarge the area of\r\ndistribution in many cases, especially in the tropics, where the forces\r\nof nature are more vigorous than in our latitudes. The ease with which\r\nspecies are accidentally spread by man increases the probability of\r\nsuch cases occurring without the intervention of human agency, and\r\nnumbers of instances may be collected of their actual occurrence.[358]\r\n\r\nA point, however, which more concerns us here is to remark on the\r\nexceedingly wide distribution of the prevailing forms of fresh-water\r\nMollusca. It might have been expected that the area of distribution in\r\nthe fresh-water forms would be greatly restricted, since they cannot\r\nmigrate across the land from one piece of water to another, and since\r\nthe barriers between pond and pond, lake and lake, and one river system\r\nand another are, as far as they are concerned, all but insuperable. We\r\nmight have expected, therefore, as Darwin and Wallace have remarked, to\r\nfind a great multiplicity of species confined to very restricted areas,\r\nsince the possibility of communication with the parent stock appears,\r\nin any given case, to be so exceedingly remote.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the exact reverse occurs. The range, not merely of\r\ngenera, but even of individual species, is astonishingly wide. This is\r\nespecially the case with regard to the Pulmonata and Pelecypoda. The\r\ngenera _Limnaea_, _Planorbis_, _Physa_, _Ancylus_, _Unio_, and _Cyclas_\r\nare world-wide. Out of about ten genera of fresh-water Mollusca in\r\nNew Zealand, one of the most isolated districts known, only one is\r\npeculiar. In South Africa and the Antilles no genus is peculiar. In the\r\nlatter case, this fact is remarkable, when we consider that the same\r\nsub-region has at least ten peculiar genera of operculate land Mollusca\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nTo give a few instances of the distribution of particular species:--\r\n\r\n_Limnaea stagnalis_ L. occurs in the whole of Europe, and northern\r\nAsia to Amoorland, Turkestan, Afghanistan, North Persia, and Kashmir;\r\nGreenland, North America from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and\r\nfrom North Canada and British Columbia as far south as Texas. The\r\ndistribution of _L. peregra_ Müll., _L. truncatula_ Müll., and _L.\r\npalustris_ Müll, is almost equally wide.\r\n\r\n_Planorbis albus_ occurs in the whole of Europe, and northern Asia to\r\nAmoorland, Kamschatka, and Japan; Turkestan, the Altai-Baikal district,\r\nAlaska and Greenland, North Canada, and the whole of eastern North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of _Anodonta anatina_ L., _Cyclas cornea_ L., and\r\n_Pisidium pusillum_ Gmel. is almost equally wide.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the accidental means of transport mentioned above\r\nare insufficient to account for the facts as we find them; we are\r\ntherefore compelled to seek for further explanation. Anything in the\r\nnature of a current furnishes a ready means of transport for Mollusca\r\nwhich have obtained a footing in the upper waters of a river, and there\r\nis no difficulty in imagining the gradual spread of species, through\r\nthe agency of floods or otherwise, over a whole river system, when\r\nonce established at any point upon it. The feeble clinging power of\r\nnewly-hatched _Limnaea_ has often been noticed as contributing to the\r\nchances of their range of distribution becoming extended. Fresh-water\r\nMollusca, too, or their ova, are exceedingly likely, from their\r\nextreme abundance, to be transported by water-birds, which fly without\r\nalighting from one piece of water to another. Again, the isolation\r\nof one river system from another is, in many instances, by no means\r\nwell marked or permanent, and a very slight alteration of level will\r\nfrequently have the effect of diverting the supplies of one watershed\r\ninto another. When we know what enormous oscillations in level have\r\ntaken place over practically the whole surface of the globe, we can\r\nrecognise the probability that the whole river system of the earth has\r\nbeen mixed up and reconstructed again and again, with a very thorough\r\nblending of adjacent fauna.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the very uniform conditions under which fresh-water\r\nMollusca live may have something to do with the uniformity of their\r\ndistribution and the comparative sameness in their development. There\r\ncan scarcely be any question that the environments of fresh-water\r\nspecies are in themselves less varied and less liable to fluctuation\r\nthan those of species whose home is the land. Water is very like\r\nwater, all the world over; it may be running or motionless, warm or\r\ncold, clear or muddy, but the general tendency is for it to be free\r\nfrom extremes of any kind. Even if the surface water of a lake or\r\nriver freezes, or becomes unusually hot, there is generally plenty of\r\nwater at a lower stratum which maintains a less extreme temperature,\r\nand to which creatures can retire on the first symptoms of a change.\r\nFrom this two results will follow. Not only will the inhabitants of a\r\npiece of water not be inclined to vary much from the type, since their\r\nwhole surroundings, food, etc., continue very much the same, but,\r\nif transported by any accident or cataclysm elsewhere, they will be\r\nexceedingly likely to arrive at a place which closely resembles their\r\nformer home in all essentials. Thus the tendency for new types to be\r\nformed would be constantly checked, or rather would very seldom arise.\r\n\r\nMr. Belt, while recognising the importance of changes of level as\r\naffecting the distribution of fresh-water species, appears to regard\r\nthe operations of such changes from a rather different point of view\r\nto that described above. “I think it probable,” he writes,[359] “that\r\nthe variation of fresh-water species of animals and plants has been\r\nconstantly checked by the want of continuity of lakes and rivers in\r\ntime and space. In the great oscillation of the surface of the earth,\r\nof which geologists find so many proofs, every fresh-water area has\r\nagain and again been destroyed.... Thus species of restricted range\r\nwere always exposed to destruction, because their habitat was temporary\r\nand their retreat impossible, and only families of wide distribution\r\ncould be preserved.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial surface of the globe has been divided, as indicating\r\nthe facts of geographical distribution, into six regions--the\r\nPalaearctic, Oriental, Australasian, Ethiopian, Nearctic, and\r\nNeotropical. To these is sometimes added a seventh, the Neantarctic,\r\nconsisting of Chili and Patagonia (and certain islands of the south\r\nAtlantic); but since the Mollusca of Chili unmistakably form a part\r\nof the Neotropical fauna, it seems hardly worth while to recognise a\r\nseparate region for those of the extreme south of South America, which\r\nhave no peculiar characteristics.\r\n\r\nIn certain points the exact limits of these regions, as indicated by\r\nthe Mollusca, will probably not correspond to those which are marked\r\nout by other zoological classes. Wallace’s line, for instance, does not\r\nexist, as far as the Mollusca are concerned.\r\n\r\nThese regions may be further subdivided into sub-regions, thus:--\r\n\r\n    Regions          Sub-regions\r\n\r\n                   { Septentrional\r\n    =Palaearctic=  { Mediterranean\r\n                   { Central Asiatic\r\n\r\n    =Oriental=     { Indo-Malay\r\n                   { Chinese\r\n\r\n                   { Papuan\r\n    =Australasian= { Australian\r\n                   { Polynesian\r\n\r\n                   { Central African\r\n    =Ethiopian=    { South African\r\n                   { Malagasy\r\n\r\n                   { American\r\n    =Nearctic=     { Californian\r\n\r\n                   { Antillean\r\n                   { Central American\r\n    =Neotropical=  { Colombian\r\n                   { Brazilian\r\n                   { Chilian\r\n\r\n\r\n                      =A. The Palaearctic Region=\r\n\r\nThe southern boundary of this region is the northern limit of the\r\nAfrican Sahara, the Mediterranean forming no break whatever in its\r\ncontinuity. In Asia this boundary is less well marked, but roughly\r\ncorresponds to the southernmost of the vast ranges of mountains\r\nwhich border the great tablelands of central Asia. Across Africa the\r\nline of desert is well defined; but in the north-east, as the desert\r\napproaches more nearly to the sea, the African extent of the region\r\nis correspondingly narrowed until it becomes little more than a strip\r\nof coast land, scarcely widening even in Lower Egypt. On the Morocco\r\ncoast, Palaearctic land forms penetrate as far south as Cape Nun.[360]\r\nAt its eastern extremity the line becomes less well defined, but\r\nprobably proceeds along the snowy mountains west of Setchouan, the\r\nPe-ling and Tan-sia-shan ranges, so as to include all the high ground\r\nof Thibet and of the upper waters of the Hoang-ho, and ultimately\r\nreaches its eastern limit at some point on the shores of the Sea of\r\nJapan.\r\n\r\nThe region thus includes all Europe, Africa north of the Sahara, with\r\nthe Atlantic islands (the Azores, Canaries, etc.), North Arabia,\r\nAsiatic Turkey, the greater part of Persia, Afghanistan, Thibet, all\r\nAsiatic Russia, and a very large portion of the Chinese empire.\r\n\r\nThe principal characteristics of the region as a whole are:--\r\n\r\n(1) The rich development of _Helix_, _Arion_, _Limax_, _Buliminus_, and\r\n_Clausilia_.\r\n\r\n(2) The comparative absence of land operculates (see map,\r\n_frontispiece_).\r\n\r\n(3) The uniform character of the fresh-water fauna.\r\n\r\nIt is in the southern portion of the region that _Helix_ (in the\r\nsub-genera _Macularia_, _Iberus_, _Pomatia_, and _Xerophila_) and\r\n_Buliminus_ (_Zebrina_, _Chondrula_, _Ena_) attain their maximum.\r\nIn the north, _Fruticicola_ is the characteristic group; in the\r\nmountainous districts of the south-east, _Campylaea_, with _Clausilia_.\r\nThe Arionidae have their headquarters in the damp and warm regions\r\nof western Europe, but are rare in the south. They only approach the\r\nMediterranean coast in Algeria, near Gibraltar, and in the region\r\nbetween the base of the Pyrenees and the Maritime Alps, and are very\r\npoor in species throughout Italy and Sardinia. They are absent from\r\nalmost the whole of northern Africa, the Mediterranean islands (except\r\nSardinia), the whole Balkan district, the Crimea, Caucasus, and western\r\nAsia.[361]\r\n\r\nThe uniformity of the fresh-water fauna is disturbed only in the\r\nextreme south. A few species of _Melanopsis_, with _Neritina_, occur\r\nin southern Spain and Austria, Galicia, and southern Russia, while a\r\n_Melania_ or two (absent from Spain) penetrate the south-eastern parts\r\nof Europe as far as Germany. _Cyrena_ begins to replace _Cyclas_ in\r\nsouthern Russia and the Caucasus.\r\n\r\nThe Palaearctic region falls into three sub-regions:--\r\n\r\n(1) The =Northern or Septentrional Sub-region=, _i.e._ the district\r\nnorth of the line formed by the Pyrenees,[362] Alps, Carpathians, and\r\nwhich, passing to the northward of the Aralo-Caspian district, follows\r\nthe great central mountain range of Asia until it reaches the Sea of\r\nJapan, perhaps somewhere in the neighbourhood of Vladivostok.\r\n\r\n(2) The =Mediterranean Sub-region=, _i.e._ the countries bordering\r\non the Mediterranean, the Black and Caspian Seas, with the Atlantic\r\nIslands.\r\n\r\n(3) The =Central Asiatic Sub-region=, _i.e._ Turkestan, Afghanistan,\r\nThibet, and probably the districts of Mongolia and Manchuria.[363]\r\n\r\n(1) The =Septentrional Sub-region= has been divided by some writers\r\ninto two provinces, the European and the Siberian. There seems, on\r\nthe whole, but little occasion to separate off northern Asia, the\r\ncharacteristic of which is, as will be seen below, rather the gradual\r\ndisappearance, as we proceed eastward, of European species and genera,\r\nthan the development of any new and peculiar groups. The remarkable\r\nfauna of Lake Baikal stands apart, not only from European, but also\r\nfrom the Siberian types occurring in its immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the Septentrional Sub-region is poor in species\r\nexcept those which inhabit fresh water. This fact is probably due\r\nto the extreme vicissitudes of temperature which prevail, and it is\r\ninteresting to notice that the number of land Mollusca appears to touch\r\nits lowest point in districts where the annual range of temperature is\r\ngreatest. On the other hand, in the western portions of the region,\r\nwhere the climate is moist and temperature more equable, the Mollusca\r\nare considerably more abundant and varied.\r\n\r\nThe line which separates the Septentrional from the Mediterranean\r\nSub-region must of necessity be very roughly drawn, and stragglers from\r\nthe south will be found to make their way northward, and _vice versâ_,\r\nunder favouring circumstances of temperature and geological formation.\r\nJordan has noticed[364] that species which in southern countries are\r\nnot confined to any particular quality of soil are in more northern\r\nlatitudes found only on limestone, which absorbs more heat than other\r\nformations. Conversely, the higher elevations of the Alps, Pyrenees,\r\nand even Carpathians are like islands in a sea, and support a\r\nthoroughly northern fauna, quite strange to that of the plains below.\r\nThus _Helix harpa_ Say, a completely boreal shell, which is at home in\r\nCanada, Sweden, Lapland, and the Amoor district, is found on the Riffel\r\nAlp, at a height of 6000 feet.[365] _Vertigo arctica_ Wall., a species\r\nabundant in Lapland, North Siberia, Iceland, and Greenland, occurs on\r\nthe high Alps of the Tyrol.\r\n\r\n_Circumpolar Species._--A certain number of species are common to\r\nthe extreme north both of the Palaearctic and Nearctic regions, and\r\nare, in fact, circumpolar. The number of these species, however, is\r\nso small, not exceeding about 40 species (= 16 genera), that it seems\r\nhardly worth while creating a special sub-region for their reception,\r\nparticularly as no genus is peculiar. At the same time the fact is\r\ninstructive as illustrating the close connexion of the northern\r\ndistricts of the two regions, a connexion which was no doubt more\r\nintimate in recent geological times than it is now.\r\n\r\nThe circumpolar genera are as follows. The list decisively sets forth\r\nthe superior hardiness of the fresh-water as compared with the land\r\ngenera:--\r\n\r\n    Valvata   1 sp.\r\n    Bithynia  1  „\r\n    Vitrina   1  „\r\n    Hyalinia  4  „\r\n    Helix     2  „\r\n    Patula    2  „\r\n    Pupa      3  „\r\n    Cionella  1  „\r\n    Succinea  1  „\r\n    Limnaea   7  „\r\n    Planorbis 5  „\r\n    Aplecta   1  „\r\n    Physa     1  „\r\n    Anodonta  1  „\r\n    Unio      1  „\r\n    Pisidium  1  „\r\n\r\n_Great Britain._--There are in all about 130 species--83 land, 46\r\nfresh-water; _Limnaea involuta_ (mountain tarn near Killarney) appears\r\nto be the only peculiar species. There are 11 _Hyalinia_, 5 _Arion_,\r\nand 25 _Helix_, the latter belonging principally to the sub-genera\r\n_Xerophila_, _Tachea_, _Trichia_, and _Fruticicola_. Three _Testacella_\r\nare probably not indigenous, but are now so well established as to\r\nreckon in the total. Of the four _Clausilia_ two reach Ireland and\r\none Scotland; two do not occur north of the Forth. There are only\r\ntwo land operculates, one of which (_Cyclostoma elegans_) occurs in\r\nIreland but not in Scotland, while the other (_Acicula lineata_)\r\nreaches the southern counties of Scotland. Several species, _e.g._\r\n_Helix pomatia_, _H. obvoluta_, _H. revelata_, _H. cartusiana_, _H.\r\npisana_, _Buliminus montanus_, are restricted to the more southern or\r\nwestern counties; _Geomalacus maculosus_ is confined to a district in\r\nsouth-western Ireland.\r\n\r\nThe Pleistocene beds of East Anglia contain a number of species now\r\nextinct in these islands, whose occurrence appears to indicate a warmer\r\nclimate than the present. Such are _Helix ruderata_, _H. fruticum_,\r\n_H. incarnata_, _Clausilia pumila_, _Unio littoralis_, _Hydrobia\r\nmarginata_, and _Corbicula fluminalis_.\r\n\r\n_Scandinavian Peninsula._--From Norway 121 species in all are recorded,\r\nand 148 from Sweden. The milder climate of Norway allows many species\r\nto reach a considerably higher latitude than in Sweden, thus in Sweden\r\n_Limax maximus_ only reaches 62°, but in Norway 66° 50´. Similarly\r\n_Arion hortensis_ and _Balea perversa_ only reach 63° and 61°\r\nrespectively in Sweden, but in Norway are found as far north as 69° and\r\n67° 50´. _Clausilia_ is represented by 9 species in southern Norway;\r\none of these is found north of the Arctic circle. There are 4 _Pupa_,\r\n9 _Vertigo_, and 11 _Hyalinia_, but _Helix_ dwindles to 14, 9 of which\r\noccur north of the Arctic circle. No land operculates are found;\r\n_Cyclostoma elegans_, however, occurs in Jutland and Zealand, which\r\npractically form a part of this district.\r\n\r\n_Iceland._--Eleven species, all Scandinavian, occur. These are _Arion_\r\n2, _Limax_ 1, _Helix_ 2 (_arbustorum_ L. and _hortensis_ Müll., the\r\nlatter being found only on the warmer southern coast), _Limnaea_ 1,\r\n_Planorbis_ 1, _Pisidium_ 4.\r\n\r\n_France._--The northern, central, and eastern districts belong to\r\nthis sub-region, while the southern and western, in which an entirely\r\nnew element occurs and many northern forms disappear, belong to the\r\nMediterranean. Thus, for instance, _Helix pomatia_ L., _H. incarnata_\r\nMüll., _H. fruticum_ Müll., _H. cantiana_ Mont., _H. strigella_ Drap.,\r\n_H. rufescens_ Penn., _H. plebeia_ Drap., are not found in southern\r\nFrance. No detailed enumeration of species is at present possible,\r\nthe efforts of a large number of the leading French authorities\r\nbeing directed to indiscriminate species-making rather than to the\r\ncareful comparison of allied forms. Perhaps the principal difference\r\nbetween the Mollusca of northern France and those of our own islands\r\nis the occurrence of two species of _Pomatias_. In the more elevated\r\ndistricts of eastern France (the Vosges, Jura, western Alps), a certain\r\nnumber of species occur which are confined to the high grounds of\r\nsouth central Europe. Among these are _Helix holoserica_ Stud.,\r\n_H. personata_ Lam., _H. bidens_ Chem., _H. depilata_ Drap., _H.\r\ncobresiana_ Alt., _H. alpina_ Faure.\r\n\r\nThe Pleistocene deposits of the valley of the Somme tell the same\r\ntale as those of eastern England, containing as they do species\r\nand even genera whose northern range is now much more limited. The\r\nEocene fossils from the Paris beds show most remarkable relationships\r\nto genera now existing in the West Indies and Central America.\r\nOthers again indicate affinities with India. Thus we find _Ceres_,\r\n_Megalomastoma_, and _Tudora_ by the side of _Leptopoma_, _Faunus_, and\r\n_Paludomus_.\r\n\r\n_Germany._--The Mollusca of the plains of northern Germany are\r\nfew and not striking, and exhibit little difference from those of\r\nour own islands. In the mountainous districts of the south and\r\nsouth-east, a number of new forms occur, amongst which are 3 species\r\nof _Daudebardia_, a remarkable carnivorous form, with the general\r\nappearance of a _Vitrina_; 24 of _Clausilia_, many _Pupa_, several\r\n_Buliminus_, 3 of the _Campylaea_ group of _Helix_, stragglers from\r\nthe Italo-Dalmatian fauna, and 1 of _Zonites_ proper. Our familiar\r\n_Helix aspersa_ is entirely absent from Germany. There are only 4 land\r\noperculates--_Pomatias_ 2, _Acicula_ 1, _Cyclostoma_ 1, all of which\r\noccur exclusively in the south. _Bithynella_ and _Vitrella_, two minute\r\nforms of fresh-water operculates akin to _Hydrobia_, occur throughout\r\nthe district.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 193.--=A=, _Daudebardia brevipes_ Fér.: _sh_,\r\n  shell; _p.o_, pulmonary orifice. (After Pfeiffer.) =B=, shell of\r\n  _D. rufa_ Pfr., S. Germany.]\r\n\r\n_Northern Russia and Siberia._--This vast tract extends from eastern\r\nGermany to the Amoor district. It is exceedingly poor in Mollusca, and\r\nis chiefly characterised by the gradual disappearance, as we proceed\r\neastward, of European species. There are a few characteristic Siberian\r\nMollusca, closely allied to European forms, and in the extreme east a\r\nnew element is introduced in the appearance of types which indicate\r\nChinese affinities. The whole district may be regarded as bounded to\r\nthe south by a line drawn from Lemberg to Moscow, and thence to Perm;\r\npassing south of the Ural mountains, it includes the whole basins of\r\nthe rivers Obi, Yenesei, and Lena, coinciding with the vast mountain\r\nranges which terminate to the north the table-land of central Asia, at\r\nthe eastern extremity of which it dips sharply southwards, so as to\r\ninclude the Amoor basin and Corea.\r\n\r\nAll the larger Helices are wanting, and no land operculates occur.\r\n_Helix arbustorum_ L., _H. nemoralis_ Müll., _H. lapicida_ L., _H.\r\naculeata_ Müll., and _Hyalinia nitidula_ Drap., do not appear to occur\r\neast of the Baltic; _Arion fuscus_ Müll., _Helix strigella_ Drap.,\r\n_Buliminus obscurus_ Müll., _Clausilia laminata_ Mont., _C. bidentata_\r\nBttg., _C. plicatula_ Drap., _Viviparus fasciatus_ Müll., and _Neritina\r\nfluviatilis_ L., do not pass the Urals.\r\n\r\nIn the Obi district (West Siberia) a further batch of European species\r\nfind their easterly limit. Among these are _Helix hispida_ L.,\r\n_Bithynia tentaculata_ L., _Vivipara vivipara_ L., _Pisidium amnicum_\r\nMüll., and _Unio tumidus_ Retz. A few distinctly Siberian species now\r\nappear, _e.g._ _Ancylus sibiricus_ Gerst., _Valvata sibirica_ Midd.,\r\nand _Vitrina rugulosa_ Koch.\r\n\r\nThe following are among the European species which reach eastern\r\nSiberia: _Hyalinia nitida_ Müll., _Succinea oblonga_ Drap., _Planorbis\r\nvortex_ L., _spirorbis_ L., _marginatus_ Drap., _rotundatus_ Poir.,\r\n_fontanus_ Light., _Valvata piscinalis_ Müll., _Bithynia ventricosa_\r\nLeach, and _Anodonta variabilis_ Drap. Here first occur such\r\ncharacteristic species as _Physa sibirica_ West., _P. aenigma_ West.,\r\n_Helix pauper_ Gld., _H. Stuxbergi_ West., _H. Nordenskiöldi_ West.,\r\n_Planorbis borealis_ Lov., _Valvata aliena_ West., _Cyclas nitida_\r\nCless., and _C. levinodis_ West. In the Amoor district a decided\r\nChinese element makes its appearance in a few hardy forms which have\r\npenetrated northward, _e.g._ _Philomycus bilineatus_ Bens., and a few\r\neach of the _Fruticicola_ (Chinese) and _Acusta_ groups of _Helix_. Out\r\nof 53 species, however, enumerated from this district, as many as 33,\r\nbelonging to 18 genera, occur also in Great Britain.\r\n\r\n_Lake Baikal._--The Mollusca of Lake Baikal exhibit distinct\r\ncharacteristics of their own, which seem to indicate the long-continued\r\nexistence of the lake in its present condition. Several entirely\r\npeculiar genera occur, which are specialised forms of _Hydrobia_,\r\n_e.g._ _Baikalia_, _Liobaikalia_, _Gerstfeldtia_, _Dybowskia_, and\r\n_Maackia_; _Benedictia_ alone extends to the basin of the Amoor.\r\n_Choanomphalus_, another peculiar and ultra-dextral (p. 250) genus\r\nbelonging to the Limnaeidae, appears to be related to the West American\r\n_Carinifex_.\r\n\r\n(2) The =Mediterranean Sub-region= is divided into four provinces:\r\n(_a_) The Mediterranean province proper; (_b_) the Pontic; (_c_) the\r\nCaucasian; and (_d_) the Atlantidean province.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _Mediterranean province proper_ is best considered by further\r\nsubdividing it, with Fischer and others, into separate districts, each\r\nof which has certain peculiar characteristics.\r\n\r\n(i) The _Hispano-Algerian_ district includes the greater part of\r\nthe Iberian peninsula, the Balearic Islands, and northern Africa\r\nfrom Morocco to Tunis. The extreme western parts of these districts,\r\nincluding West Morocco, Portugal, Asturias, and south-west France,\r\nunder the influence of the moist climate caused by the Atlantic, show\r\nsome peculiar features which, in the view of some, are sufficient to\r\njustify their separation from the rest of the Hispano-Algerian portion.\r\nAmong these is a marked development of the slugs, _Testacella_,\r\n_Arion_, and _Geomalacus_, the latter of which occurs even in\r\nsouth-western Ireland.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 194.--=A=, _Parmacella Valenciensii_ W. and\r\n  B. × ⅔. (After Moquin-Tandon.) =A´=, shell of the same, natural\r\n  size.]\r\n\r\n_Spain._--The principal features are the development of the\r\n_Macularia_, _Iberus_, and _Gonostoma_ groups of _Helix_, and the\r\noccurrence of the remarkable slug _Parmacella_, which is found in\r\nmany other parts of the sub-region, and extends eastward as far as\r\nAfghanistan. _Clausilia_ has but few species, mostly in the north.\r\nThere are four species of land operculates, one of which is referred\r\nto a genus (_Tudora_) now living only in the West Indies, but which\r\noccurs in the Eocene fossils of the Paris basin. In the south there are\r\nseveral species of _Melanopsis_ and _Neritina_.\r\n\r\nThe _States of Northern Africa_ have a thoroughly Mediterranean fauna,\r\nwhose facies on the whole shows rather more affinity to Spain than to\r\nSicily. The Helices of Morocco and Algeria belong to the same groups as\r\nthose of southern Spain. Many are of a dead white colour, the better\r\nto resist the scorching effect of the sun. _Ferussacia_ is abundant,\r\n_Geomalacus_ and _Parmacella_ are represented by a single species\r\neach, and there is one _Clausilia_. According to Kobelt,[366] the\r\noriginal land connexion between southern Spain and Morocco must have\r\nbeen much more extensive than is usually assumed, and probably reached\r\nat least to the meridian of Oran and Cartagena. The Mollusca of Oran\r\nand Cartagena are, according to him, much more closely related than\r\nthose of Oran and Tangier, or those of Cartagena and Gibraltar, but at\r\nCartagena some species, which are characteristic of the Mediterranean\r\ncoasts from Syria westward, disappear, are absent from the rest of\r\nSpain and from Morocco, but reappear on the south-western coasts of\r\nFrance. These species may possibly have pushed along that arm of the\r\nsea which, when the Straits of Gibraltar were closed as far as the\r\nlatitude of Oran and Cartagena, united in comparatively recent times\r\nthe Bay of Biscay with the Gulf of Lions.\r\n\r\nThe following genera, which do not occur in Spain, have probably spread\r\ninto northern Africa as far as Algeria, _via_ Sicily and Tunis, namely,\r\n_Glandina_ (1 sp.), _Daudebardia_ (1 sp.), _Pomatias_ (2 sp.). Tunis\r\nshows strong traces of Sicilian influence, and Kobelt found a colony of\r\nsnails, of Sicilian affinities, as far west as Tetuan.\r\n\r\n_The Sahara._--The Algerian Sahara contains, in many places, a\r\nsub-fossil Molluscan fauna which appears to show that the district\r\nhas, in quite recent times, undergone a gradual desiccation. The\r\nspecies are mainly fresh-water, including _Melania_, _Melanopsis_,\r\nand _Corbicula_, with here and there valves of _Cardium edule_, and\r\nindicate, on the whole, an affinity with recent Egyptian, rather than\r\nNorth African species. It is probable that a vast series of _étangs_,\r\nor brackish-water lakes, once stretched along this region, and were\r\nultimately connected with the sea somewhere between Tunis and Egypt.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 195.--Characteristic shells of S. France:\r\n  =A=, _Helix_ (_Macularia_) _niciensis_ Fér.; =B=, _Leucochroa\r\n  candidissima_ Drap.]\r\n\r\n(ii) _Southern France._--The southern portion of France bordering on\r\nthe Mediterranean contains many species, especially of _Helix_, which\r\ndo not occur in the centre and north. Amongst these are--\r\n\r\n    Leucochroa candidissima Drap.\r\n    Hyalinia olivetorum Gmel.\r\n    Zonites algirus L.\r\n    Helix rangiana Desh.\r\n      „   serpentina Fér.\r\n      „   niciensis Fér.\r\n      „   splendida Drap.\r\n      „   vermiculata Müll.\r\n      „   melanostoma Drap.\r\n      „   aperta Born.\r\n      „   ciliata Ven.\r\n      „   explanata Müll.\r\n      „   apicina Lam.\r\n      „   cespitum Drap.\r\n      „   Terverii Mich.\r\n      „   pyramidata Drap.\r\n      „   trochoides Poir.\r\n    Ferussacia folliculus Gron.\r\n    Rumina decollata L.\r\n    Pupa megacheilos C. and J.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of fresh-water _Hydrobia_ (_Bithynella_) occur. The\r\ndistrict, on the whole, unites certain characteristics derived from\r\nnorthern Italy with those of eastern Spain.\r\n\r\n(iii) The _Italo-Dalmatian_ district includes Italy and the\r\nneighbouring islands (Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Malta), and the\r\nregions at the head and north-eastern shores of the Adriatic\r\n(Carinthia, Carniola, Croatia, and Dalmatia), the line which separates\r\nthese latter districts from the fauna of southern Austria, Bosnia, and\r\nServia being very difficult to define.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 196.--_Helix_ (_Pomatia_) _aperta_ L., S.\r\n  France, showing epiphragm.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 197.--_Helix_ (_Campylaea_) _zonata_ Stud.,\r\n  Piedmont.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 198.--_Helix_ (_Iberus_) _strigata_ Müll.,\r\n  Florence.]\r\n\r\n_Italy_, with the neighbouring islands, has a rich molluscan fauna.\r\nIn the sub-Alpine districts of northern Italy the prominent _Helix_\r\ngroups are _Campylaea_, _Pomatia_, and _Anchistoma_, which in the south\r\nare generally replaced by _Iberus_, which here attains its maximum\r\ndevelopment. Large _Hyalinia_ are abundant in the north, and _Pomatias_\r\nand _Clausilia_ are frequent all along the Apennines. _Sicily_ has\r\nabout 250 species, half of which are peculiar. Helices of the _Iberus_\r\ntype abound, but _Campylaea_ is reduced to two species. Many peculiar\r\nforms of _Clausilia_ occur, especially a latticed type of great beauty.\r\n_Ferussacia_ and _Pupa_ are well represented, and there are one each\r\nof _Glandina_ and _Daudebardia_.\r\n\r\n_Dalmatia_ and the adjacent districts are chiefly remarkable for the\r\nrich development of _Clausilia_, which here attains its maximum (nearly\r\n100 species). The _Campylaea_ section of _Helix_ is represented by its\r\nhandsomest forms, many of which are studded with short hairs. Here too\r\nis the headquarters of _Zonites_ proper, which stretches westward as\r\nfar as Provence, and eastward to Asia Minor; and also of the single\r\nEuropean _Glandina_, which has a similar eastward range, but spreads\r\nwestward through Italy and Sicily to Algeria, not occurring in southern\r\nFrance. The land operculates are chiefly represented by _Pomatias_, and\r\namong the fresh-water operculates are a _Melania_ and a _Lithoglyphus_,\r\nthe latter having probably spread from the basin of the Danube.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 199.--=A=, _Clausilia crassicosta_ Ben.,\r\n  Sicily; =B=, _Clausilia macarana_ Zieg., Dalmatia; =B´=,\r\n  clausilium of same.]\r\n\r\n(iv) The _Egypto-Syrian_ district extends along the south-eastern\r\nshores of the Mediterranean from Tripoli to North Syria, and eastward\r\nto the Euphrates valley. Lower Egypt alone belongs to this portion,\r\nthe fauna of Upper Egypt being of an entirely tropical character, and\r\nbelonging to the Ethiopian Region.\r\n\r\n_Lower Egypt._--The Mollusca of Lower Egypt stand in the unique\r\nposition of belonging, half to the Palaearctic, and half to the\r\nEthiopian Region. The land Mollusca are of a distinctly Mediterranean\r\ntype, while the fresh-water, directly connected as they are by the\r\ngreat highway of the Nile with regions much farther south, contain\r\na large admixture of thoroughly tropical genera (_Ampullaria_,\r\n_Lanistes_, _Melania_, _Cleopatra_, _Corbicula_, _Cyrena_, _Iridina_,\r\n_Spatha_, _Mutela_). The _Helices_, which are not numerous, are\r\nrather a mixture of circum-Mediterranean species than of a specially\r\ndistinctive character. _H. desertorum_, however, belonging to the group\r\n_Eremophila_, is characteristic. There is a single _Parmacella_, but\r\nthe physical features of the country are unfavourable to the occurrence\r\nof such genera as _Clausilia_, _Pupa_, _Hyalinia_, and the land\r\noperculates.\r\n\r\n_Syria._--The Mollusca, especially in the more mountainous regions\r\nof the north, are much more varied and numerous than those of\r\nEgypt. _Clausilia_ is again fairly plentiful, and the Helicidae are\r\nrepresented by some striking forms of the sections _Levantina_,\r\n_Pomatia_, and _Nummulina_. _Leucochroa_ has several curious types with\r\na constricted aperture, and the Agnatha are represented by _Libania_, a\r\npeculiar form of _Daudebardia_. A prominent feature is the occurrence\r\nof a number of large white _Buliminus_ of the _Petraeus_ section (Fig.\r\n200). Land operculates appear to be absent, but _Melanopsis_ and\r\n_Neritina_ are abundant. The Dead Sea contains no Mollusca, but Lake\r\nTiberias has a rich fauna, including the above-mentioned genera, with a\r\n_Corbicula_ and several _Unio_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 200.--=A=, _Buliminus_ (_Petraeus_)\r\n  _labrosus_ Oliv., Beyrout; =B=, _Buliminus_ (_Chondrula_)\r\n  _septemdentatus_ Roth., Palestine.]\r\n\r\n_Upper Mesopotamia_ appears to possess a mixture of Syrian and\r\nCaucasian forms, including a _Parmacella_. Lower Mesopotamia has an\r\nexceedingly poor land fauna, but is comparatively rich in fresh-water\r\nspecies, the growing eastern character of which is shown by the\r\noccurrence of several _Corbicula_ and _Pseudodon_, and of a _Neritina_\r\nof a distinctly Indian type.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _Pontic province_ extends from Western Austria to the Sea of\r\nAzof, and includes Austria, Hungary, Roumania, the Balkan peninsula\r\n(so far as it does not form part of the Mediterranean sub-region),\r\nthe islands of the Greek Archipelago, southern Russia and the Crimea,\r\nand Asia Minor. It thus practically corresponds to the whole Danube\r\nbasin, together with the lands bordering on the Black Sea, except at\r\nthe extreme east, which belongs to the Caucasian sub-region. Fischer\r\nseparates off Greece, Asia Minor (except the northern coast-line),\r\nand the intervening islands, with Crete and Cyprus, as constituting\r\na portion (Hellado-Anatolic) of the Mediterranean sub-region proper.\r\nThese districts, however, appear to possess scarcely sufficient\r\nindividuality to warrant their separate consideration.\r\n\r\nA prominent characteristic of the Pontic Mollusca is the great\r\nabundance of _Clausilia_ and _Buliminus_. In the islands east and\r\nwest of Greece _Clausilia_ forms a large proportion of the fauna,\r\neach island, however small, possessing its own peculiar forms. The\r\nHelices belong principally to the groups _Campylaea_ (which is very\r\nabundant in Austro-Hungary), _Pomatia_ (Greece and Asia Minor), and\r\n_Anchistoma_. _Macularia_ is comparatively scarce, but is represented\r\nin Greece by one very large form (_Codringtonii_ Gray). _Zonites_\r\nproper has its metropolis in this sub-region, and the Danube basin\r\ncontains one or two species of _Melania_ and _Lithoglyphus_.\r\n_Buliminus_ is abundant throughout the sub-region, in the sub-genera\r\n_Zebrina_, _Napaeus_, _Mastus_, and _Chondrula_. Several striking forms\r\nof _Zebrina_ (_Ena_) are peculiar to the Crimea.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Caucasian Province._--The limits of this province can hardly\r\nbe exactly defined at present. It appears, however, to include the\r\nwhole line of the Caucasus range, Armenia, and North Persia.\r\n\r\nThe land Mollusca are abundant and interesting. Among the carnivorous\r\ngenera are four species of _Daudebardia_, a _Glandina_, and three\r\npeculiar forms of naked slug, _Pseudomilax_, _Trigonochlamys_, and\r\n_Selenochlamys_. There is a single _Parmacella_, the same species as\r\nthe Mesopotamian, and a good many forms of _Limax_. _Vitrina_ and\r\n_Hyalinia_ are well represented, and the predominant groups of _Helix_\r\nare _Euloto_, _Cartusiana_, _Xerophila_, and _Fruticocampylaea_, the\r\nlast being peculiar. _Clausilia_ and _Pupa_ are rich in species,\r\ntogether with _Buliminus_ of the _Chondrula_ type. One _Clausilia_ of\r\nthe _Phaedusa_ section, together with a _Macrochlamys_ (Transcaspian\r\nonly), a _Corbicula_, and a _Cyclotus_, show marked traces of Asiatic\r\naffinity. There is one species each of _Acicula_ and _Cyclostoma_, and\r\none of _Pomatias_.\r\n\r\nThe Caspian Sea, like Lakes Baikal and Tanganyika, is distinguished\r\nby the possession of several remarkable and peculiar genera. The sea\r\nitself, the waters of which are brackish, is 80 feet below the level\r\nof the Black Sea, and is no doubt a relict of what formed, in earlier\r\ntimes, a very much larger expanse of water. Marine deposits containing\r\nfauna now characteristic of the Caspian, have been found as far north\r\nas the Samara bend of the Volga. It is probable, therefore, that\r\nin Post-pliocene times an arm of the Aralo-Caspian Sea penetrated\r\nnorthward up the present basin of the Volga to at least 54° N. The\r\nKazan depression of the Volga (55° N.) also contains characteristic\r\nCaspian fossils.[367] According to Brusina,[368] the Caspian fauna, as\r\na whole, is closely related to the Tertiary fauna of southern Europe.\r\n\r\nTwenty-six species of univalve Mollusca, the majority being modified\r\nforms of _Hydrobia_, have been described from the Caspian, namely,\r\n_Micromelania_ (6), _Caspia_ (7), _Clessinia_ (3), _Nematurella_ (3),\r\n_Lithoglyphus_ (1), _Planorbis_ (1), _Zagrabica_ (1), _Hydrobia_ (2),\r\n_Neritina_ (2). The bivalves are mostly modified forms of _Cardium_\r\n(_Didacna_, _Adacna_, _Monodacna_), which also occur in estuaries along\r\nthe north of the Black Sea. A form of _Cardium edule_ itself occurs,\r\nand numberless varieties of the same species are found in a semi-fossil\r\ncondition in the dry or half dry lake-beds, which are so abundant\r\nthroughout the Aral district.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The Atlantidean province_ consists of the four groups of\r\nislands, the Madeiran group, the Canaries, the Azores, and the Cape\r\nVerdes.\r\n\r\n_The Madeiran group_ contains between 140 and 150 species of Mollusca\r\nwhich may be regarded as indigenous, the great majority of which are\r\npeculiar. Only 11 species are common to Madeira and to the Azores,\r\nand about the same number, in spite of their much greater proximity,\r\nto Madeira and the Canaries. No less than 74 species, or almost\r\nexactly one-half, belong to _Helix_, and 9 to _Patula_. A considerable\r\nnumber of the Helices are not only specifically but generically\r\npeculiar, the genera bearing close relationship to those occurring\r\nin the Mediterranean region. As a rule they are small in size, but\r\noften of singular beauty of ornamentation. Various forms of _Pupa_\r\nare exceedingly abundant (28 sp.), as is also _Ferussacia_ (12 sp.).\r\nThere are also 3 _Clausilia_ (which genus occurs on this group alone),\r\nand 3 _Vitrina_ (a genus which occurs on all the groups). The land\r\noperculates are represented solely by 4 _Craspedopoma_, which is common\r\nto all the groups except the Cape Verdes.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 201.--Characteristic land Mollusca from the\r\n  Madeira group: =A=, _Helix_ (_Irus_) _laciniosa_ Lowe, Madeira;\r\n  =B=, _Helix_ (_Hystricella_) _turricula_ Lowe, Porto Santo; =C=,\r\n  _Helix_ (_Iberus_) _Wollastoni_ Lowe, Porto Santo; =D=, _Helix_\r\n  (_Coronaria_) _delphinuloides_ Lowe, Madeira.]\r\n\r\n_The Canaries_ have about 160 species, only about a dozen of which are\r\nnot peculiar. As many as 75 of these belong to _Helix_ (the sub-genera\r\nbeing very much the same as in the Madeiran group), and 11 to _Patula_.\r\nThere is 1 species of _Parmacella_ (which occurs in this group\r\nalone), and 6 of _Vitrina_, of considerable size. A remarkable slug\r\n(_Plectrophorus_) was described from Teneriffe by Férussac many years\r\nago, but it has never been rediscovered, and is probably mythical, or\r\nwrongly assigned. _Buliminus_ (_Napaeus_) has as many as 28 species,\r\nall but one being peculiar, and _Ferussacia_ 7. _Cyclostoma_ has two\r\nindigenous species, which, with one _Hydrocena_ and one _Craspedopoma_,\r\nmake up the operculate land fauna.\r\n\r\n_The Azores_ are comparatively poor in Mollusca, having only 52\r\nspecies, nearly two-thirds of which are peculiar. _Helix_ has 15\r\nspecies, _Patula_ 4, and _Pupa_ 8. _Ferussacia_, so abundant in\r\nMadeira and the Canaries, is entirely absent, its place being taken by\r\n_Napaeus_ (7 sp.), which is curiously absent from Madeira, but richly\r\nrepresented in the Canaries. There are 7 _Vitrina_, while the land\r\noperculates consist of one each of _Craspedopoma_ and _Hydrocena_.\r\nA singular slug (_Plutonia_), with an ancyliform internal shell, is\r\nsaid to occur. The group was long believed to possess no fresh-water\r\nMollusca, but two species (one each of _Pisidium_ and _Physa_) have\r\nrecently been discovered.\r\n\r\n_The Cape Verdes_, owing to the extreme dryness of their climate, are\r\npoor in land Mollusca. There are 11 _Helix_, nearly all of which belong\r\nto the group _Leptaxis_, which is common to Madeira and the Canaries.\r\n_Ferussacia_ is absent, _Buliminus_ is represented by a single species,\r\nand there are no land operculates. Ethiopian influence, however, as\r\nmight be expected from the situation of the group, is seen in the\r\noccurrence of an _Ennea_, a _Melania_, and an _Isidora_.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed how little countenance the molluscan fauna of these\r\nisland groups gives to any theory of an Atlantis, any theory which\r\nregards the islands as the remains of a western continent now sunk\r\nbeneath the ocean. Had ‘Atlantis’ ever existed, we should have expected\r\nto find a considerable proportion of the Mollusca common to all the\r\ngroups, and perhaps to Europe as well, and there would apparently be\r\nno reason why a genus which occurred in one group should not occur in\r\nall. As a fact, we find the species extremely localised throughout,\r\nand genera occur and fail to occur in a particular group without any\r\nobvious reason. All the evidence tends to show that the islands are\r\npurely oceanic, and have been colonised from the western coasts of the\r\nMediterranean, _i.e._ from the direction of the prevailing currents and\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\n(3) =Central-Asiatic Sub-region.=--The countries included in this vast\r\nsub-region are Turkestan, Songaria, Afghanistan, including the Pamirs,\r\nWestern Thibet, and probably Mongolia. Kashmir belongs to the Indian\r\nfauna. At present the whole district is very imperfectly known; indeed,\r\nit is only at a few points that anything like a thorough investigation\r\nof the fauna has been made. It is therefore almost premature to\r\npronounce any decided opinion upon the Mollusca, but all the evidence\r\nat present to hand tends to show that they belong to the Palaearctic\r\nand not to the Oriental system. This is especially the case with regard\r\nto the fresh-water Mollusca, many of which are specifically identical\r\nwith those occurring in our own islands. A slight admixture of such\r\nwidely distributed types as _Corbicula_ and _Melania_ occurs, but it\r\nis not sufficient to disturb the general European facies of the whole.\r\nIt is possible that eventually the whole district may be regarded as a\r\nsub-region combining certain characteristics of the eastern portions of\r\nthe Mediterranean basin with an extension of the septentrional element,\r\ndue to higher elevation and more rigorous climate. The principal\r\nfeatures in the land Mollusca appear to be the occurrence of a number\r\nof _Buliminus_ of the _Napaeus_ group, a few _Parmacella_ (Afghanistan\r\nbeing the limit of the genus eastward), _Clausilia_, _Pupa_, _Limax_,\r\nand _Helix_, with several stray species of _Macrochlamys_.\r\n\r\n\r\n              =B. The Oriental or Palaeotropical Region=\r\n\r\nThis region includes all Asia to the south of the boundary of the\r\nPalaearctic region, that is to say, India, with Ceylon, Burmah, Siam,\r\nand the whole of the Malay Peninsula, China proper, with Hainan and\r\nFormosa, and Japan south of Yesso. It also includes the Andamans and\r\nNicobars, and the whole of Malaysia, with the Philippines, as far\r\neastward as, and including Celebes with the Xulla Is., and the string\r\nof islands south of the Banda Sea up to the Ké Is. The Moluccas,\r\nin their two groups, are intermediate between the Oriental and\r\nAustralasian regions.\r\n\r\nIn this vast extent of land two distinct centres of influence are\r\nprominent--the Indian and the Chinese. Each is of marked individuality,\r\nbut they differ in this essential point, that while the Chinese element\r\nis decidedly restricted in area, being, in fact, more or less confined\r\nto China itself and the adjacent islands, the Indian element, on the\r\nother hand, extends far beyond continental Asia, and embraces all the\r\nMalay islands to their farthest eastward extent, until it becomes\r\noverpowered by the Papuan and Australian fauna. Upper Burmah, with\r\nSiam, forms a sort of meeting-point of the two elements, which here\r\nintermingle in such a way that no very definite line of demarcation can\r\nbe drawn between them.\r\n\r\nThus we have--\r\n\r\n                   {                             { (_a_) Indian Province\r\n                   { 1. _Indo-Malay Sub-Region_  { (_b_) Siamese Province\r\n =Oriental Region= {                             { (_c_) Malay Province\r\n                   {                             { (_d_) Philippine Province\r\n                   {\r\n                   {                             { (_a_) Chinese Province\r\n                   { 2. _Chinese Sub-Region_     { (_b_) Japanese Province\r\n\r\nThe Indo-Malay fauna spreads eastward from its metropolis, but has\r\npractically no westward extension, or only such as may be traced on the\r\neastern coasts of Africa and the off-lying islands. There appears to\r\nexist no other case in the world where the metropolis of a fauna is so\r\nplainly indicated, or where it lies, not near the centre, but at one of\r\nthe ends of the whole area of distribution.\r\n\r\nComparing the two sub-regions, the Chinese is distinguished by the\r\ngreat predominance of _Helix_, while in the Indo-Malay sub-region\r\n_Nanina_ and the related genera are in the ascendancy. In India\r\nitself there are only 6 genera of true Helicidae, poorly represented\r\nin point of numbers; in China there are at least three times this\r\namount, most of them abundant in species. The Indo-Malay sub-region,\r\non the other hand, is the metropolis of the Naninidae, which abound\r\nboth in genera and species. In the Chinese sub-region _Clausilia_\r\nattains a development almost rivalling that of S.E. Europe, while in\r\nIndia there are scarcely a dozen species. A marked feature of the\r\nIndo-Malay sub-region is the singular group of tubed land operculates\r\n(_Opisthoporus_, _Pterocyclus_, etc.). In China the group is only\r\nrepresented by stragglers of Indian derivation, while the land\r\noperculate fauna, as a whole, is distinctly inferior to the Indian.\r\nAnother characteristic group of the Indo-Malay region is _Amphidromus_,\r\nwith its gaudily painted and often sinistral shell; the genus is\r\nentirely absent from China proper and Japan, where its place is taken\r\nby various small forms of the _Buliminus_ group. Fresh-water Mollusca,\r\nespecially the bivalves and operculates, are far more abundant in the\r\nChinese sub-region than in the Indo-Malay.\r\n\r\n(1) The =Indo-Malay Sub-region=.--(_a_) _The Indian Province_ proper\r\nincludes the peninsula of Hindostan, together with Assam and Upper and\r\nLower Burmah. To the east and extreme north-east, the boundaries of the\r\nprovince are ill-defined, and the fauna gradually assimilates with the\r\nSiamese on the one hand and the Chinese on the other. Roughly speaking,\r\nthe line of demarcation follows the mountain ranges which separate\r\nBurmese from Chinese territory, but the debatable ground is of wide\r\nextent, and Yunnan, the first Chinese province over the border, has\r\nmany species common with Upper Burmah.\r\n\r\nThe gigantic ranges of mountains which bound the sub-region to the\r\nnorth-west and north limit the extension of the Indian fauna in those\r\ndirections in a most decisive manner. There is no quarter of the world,\r\neven in W. America, where a mountain chain has equal effect in barring\r\nback a fauna. In the north of Kashmir, where the great forests end,\r\nthere is a most complete change of environment as the traveller gains\r\nthe summit of the watershed; but Kashmir itself distinctly belongs to\r\nthe Indian and not the Palaearctic system. The great desert to the\r\nsouth of the Punjab is equally effective as a barrier towards the west.\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca of India proper include a very large number of interesting\r\nand remarkable genera. India is the metropolis of the great family\r\nof the Naninidae, or snails with a caudal mucus-pore, which are here\r\nrepresented by no less than 14 genera and over 200 species. The\r\ngenera _Macrochlamys_, _Sitala_, _Kaliella_, _Ariophanta_, _Girasia_,\r\n_Austenia_, and _Durgella_ are at their maximum. _Helix_ is scarcely\r\nrepresented, containing only about 30 inconspicuous species (leaving\r\nCeylon out of account). _Buliminus_ is abundant, especially in\r\nthe north. The Stenogyridae are represented by _Glessula_, which\r\nis exceedingly abundant in India, but has only a few straggling\r\nrepresentatives in the rest of the Oriental region. Among the Pupidae\r\nis the remarkable form _Boysia_, with its twisted upturned mouth,\r\nwhile _Lithotis_ is a peculiar form allied to _Succinea_, to which\r\ngroup also probably belongs _Camptonyx_, a limpet-like form with a very\r\nsmall spire, peculiar to the Kattiawar peninsula. _Camptoceras_, an\r\nextraordinarily elongated sinistral shell, with a loosely coiled spire,\r\nis peculiar to the N.W. Provinces.\r\n\r\nAmong the fresh-water pulmonates is an _Ampullarina_, a genus only\r\nknown elsewhere from the Fiji Is. and E. Australia. _Cremnoconchus_ is\r\na form of _Littorina_, peculiar to the W. Ghâts, which has habituated\r\nitself to a terrestrial life on moist rocks many miles from the sea.\r\nThe fresh-water operculates include the peculiar forms _Mainwaringia_,\r\nfrom the mouth of the Ganges (intermediate between _Melania_ and\r\n_Paludomus_), _Stomatodon_, _Larina_, _Fossarulus_, _Tricula_, and\r\nothers. The bivalves are neither numerous nor remarkable; _Velorita_, a\r\ngenus of the Cyrenidae, is peculiar.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 202.--Characteristic Indian Mollusca: =A=,\r\n  _Hypselostoma tubiferum_ Blanf.; =B=, _Camptoceras terebra_\r\n  Bens.; =C=, _Camptonyx Theobaldi_ Bens.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 203.--_Streptaxis Perroteti_ Pfr., Nilghiri\r\n  Hills: =A=, adult; =A´=, young form.]\r\n\r\nThe land operculate fauna of India is singularly rich and varied. About\r\n25 genera, and at least 190 species, occur. Here we find the metropolis\r\nof _Cyclophorus_ among the larger forms, and of _Diplommatina_ and\r\n_Alycaeus_ among the smaller. A large proportion of the operculate\r\ngenera are quite peculiar to the extreme south of India and Ceylon. The\r\nappearance of a few species of the European genus _Pomatias_ is very\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nThe carnivorous genera are poorly represented. A few _Ennea_ occur,\r\nwhile _Streptaxis_ is practically confined to the extreme south and\r\nnorth-east.\r\n\r\n\r\n            _Land and Fresh-water Mollusca of India proper_\r\n\r\n    Streptaxis        9\r\n    Ennea             8\r\n    Helicarion       15\r\n    Girasia          14\r\n    Austenia         11\r\n    Ibycus            1\r\n    Africarion        2\r\n    Durgella          4\r\n    Ariophanta       15\r\n    Xesta             8\r\n    Macrochlamys     78\r\n    Microcystis       7\r\n    Sitala           20\r\n    Kaliella         35\r\n    Hemiplecta       15\r\n    Sesara            3\r\n    Trochomorpha      5\r\n    Trochomorphoides  1\r\n    Parmacella (?)    1\r\n    Tebennophorus     1\r\n    Anadenus          4\r\n    Plectopylis      11\r\n    Plectotropis      3\r\n    Trachia          12\r\n    Thysanota         1\r\n    Camaena           1\r\n    Amphidromus       2\r\n    Boysia            1\r\n    Petraeus         14\r\n    Cerastus          6\r\n    Rachis            5\r\n    Cylindrus         1\r\n    Pupa             15\r\n    Hapalus           4\r\n    Clausilia        10\r\n    Subulina          2\r\n    Opeas             6\r\n    Glessula         49\r\n    Geostilbia        3\r\n    Succinea         11\r\n    Lithotis          2\r\n    Vaginula          1\r\n    Camptonyx         1\r\n    Coelostele        1\r\n    Carychium         3\r\n    Ancylus           1\r\n    Limnaea           7\r\n    Camptoceras       3\r\n    Planorbis        10\r\n    Ampullarina       1\r\n    Melania          17\r\n    Mainwaringia      1\r\n    Paludomus        10\r\n    Stomatodon        1\r\n    Larina            1\r\n    Cremnoconchus     3\r\n    Fairbankia        2\r\n    Tricula           1\r\n    Bithynia          9\r\n    Fossarulus        1\r\n    Stenothyra        3\r\n    Vivipara          4\r\n    Valvata           1\r\n    Ampullaria        4\r\n    Assiminea         9\r\n    Acmella           2\r\n    Pomatias          4\r\n    Diplommatina     63\r\n    Pupina            1\r\n    Streptaulus       1\r\n    Coptochilus       3\r\n    Alycaeus         49\r\n    Lagochilus        1\r\n    Cyclophorus      12\r\n    Scalaina          1\r\n    Micraulax         2\r\n    Jerdonia         10\r\n    Spiraculum        4\r\n    Otopoma           1\r\n    Cyclotopsis       2\r\n    Georissa          1\r\n    Modiola           1\r\n    Scaphula          1\r\n    Unio             40\r\n    Solenaia          1\r\n    Cyrena           13\r\n    Sphaerium         1\r\n    Pisidium          5\r\n    Velorita          2\r\n    Tanysiphon        1\r\n    Novaculina        1\r\n    Nausitora         1\r\n\r\n_The Cingalese district_, which almost approaches the character of a\r\ndistinct province, presents several remarkable points of dissimilarity\r\nfrom the rest of India. It consists of the island of Ceylon, and of\r\na portion of S. India whose exact limits have yet to be defined. It\r\nappears, however, that the Western or Malabar coast, with the hills\r\nparallel to it, is more akin to Ceylon than the Eastern or Coromandel\r\ncoast. The Travancore, Malabar, and S. Canara districts, with the\r\nPalnai, Anamalai, and Nilghiri Hills, are markedly Cingalese, while\r\nthere seems to be no distinct evidence of similar relationship on the\r\npart of the Madras or even the Cuddalore district.\r\n\r\nAmong the principal features of the Cingalese district is the\r\noccurrence of three peculiar genera of _Helix_, one (_Acavus_) large\r\nand finely coloured, another (_Corilla_) smaller, with a singularly\r\ntoothed aperture. While the _Corilla_ group shows relations with\r\n_Plectopylis_ and other Burmese and Siamese sub-genera _Acavus_ (Fig.\r\n204) is totally distinct from any other Indian form, and shows signs\r\nof close relationship, in the great size of the embryonic shell, to\r\nthe Helices of Madagascar (p. 335). In Ceylon the group is entirely\r\nisolated, and its occurrence, besides decisively separating that\r\nisland from India, Burmah, and Siam, forms a most interesting problem\r\nin the history of distribution. _Eurystoma_, with a single species (_E.\r\nvittata_ Müll.), is also peculiar.\r\n\r\nAs usual when _Helix_ gains ascendancy, the Naninidae retrogress.\r\n_Durgella_, _Austenia_, and _Girasia_ are absent altogether, while\r\n_Macrochlamys_, _Sitala_, _Kaliella_, etc., are present in greatly\r\ndiminished numbers. The sub-genus _Beddomea_ is peculiar, a form\r\ndirectly related to _Amphidromus_ (Siam and Malacca). The fresh-water\r\noperculate _Philopotamis_ is peculiar, but for one species found in\r\nSumatra; while _Tanalia_ is quite peculiar. But the forms which, next\r\nto the _Helices_, most emphasise the separation of the Cingalese\r\ndistrict are the land operculates. There are eleven genera or\r\nsub-genera of land operculates which do not occur in the rest of India\r\nproper. Two (_Aulopoma_ and _Cataulus_) are quite peculiar, while the\r\nother nine are represented in Burmah, Siam, and the Malay islands, but\r\nnot in India. On the other hand, _Diplommatina_ and _Alycaeus_, so\r\nprofusely abundant in India, have not yet been discovered in Ceylon.\r\nAmong the slugs, _Tennentia_ is a peculiar genus, whose nearest\r\nrelation occurs in the Seychelles.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 204.--_Helix_ (_Acavus_) _Waltoni_ Reeve,\r\n  Ceylon, showing embryonic shell (_emb_). × ⅔.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genera and Subgenera occurring in the Cingalese District, but not in\r\nN. and Central India_\r\n\r\n    Streptaxis\r\n    Tennentia\r\n    Acavus\r\n    Eurystoma\r\n    Corilla\r\n    Beddomea\r\n    Philopotamis\r\n    Tanalia\r\n    Theobaldius\r\n    Leptopomoides\r\n    Craspedotropis\r\n    Pterocyclus\r\n    Aulopoma\r\n    Ditropis\r\n    Cyathopoma\r\n    Mychopoma\r\n    Cataulus\r\n    Nicida\r\n    Opisthostoma\r\n\r\nThe district consisting of _Upper Burmah_, _Pegu_, _Tenasserim_, and\r\n_Aracan_, while essentially a part of the Indian province, contains\r\nseveral Siamese genera which are not found in India proper, as well\r\nas several which are at present peculiar. Amongst the former category\r\nare, of Helicidae, a single representative each of the genera _Camaena_\r\n(Siamese and Chinese) and _Aegista_ (Chinese). Influence of the same\r\nkind is seen in the increased numbers of _Plectopylis_ (14 sp.) and\r\n_Plectotropis_ (5 sp.), of _Clausilia_ (10 sp.) and _Amphidromus_ (5\r\nsp.), and of the large tubed operculates (11 sp. in all). _Sesara_ and\r\n_Sophina_ among the Naninidae are strange to India, while _Hyalimax_ is\r\ncommon only to the Andamans, Nicobars, and Mascarene Is. _Hypselostoma_\r\n(Fig. 202, A) is a most remarkable genus of the Pupidae, reminding one\r\nof _Anostoma_ of the New World. It is peculiar to the peninsula, but\r\nfor one species in the Philippines. Among the Pupinidae, we have the\r\npeculiar _Raphaulus_ and _Hybocystis_ (Fig. 205), a very remarkable\r\nform, of which another species occurs at Perak. Two _Helicina_ mark the\r\nmost westward extension of the genus on the mainland. In the extreme\r\nnorth of Upper Burmah, Indian and Chinese forms intermingle.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 205.--_Hybocystis gravida_ Bens. Young and\r\n  adult.]\r\n\r\nThe Burmese district, together with the Indian and Siamese provinces,\r\nis pre-eminently the home of a group of Mollusca, originally of marine\r\norigin, which have permanently habituated themselves to a brackish\r\nor fresh-water existence. They belong to widely different families,\r\nand even Orders. Besides _Cremnoconchus_ mentioned above, we have,\r\namong the bivalves, _Novaculina_, a _Solen_ living in fresh water in\r\nthe Ganges, Irawadi, and Tenasserim estuaries; _Scaphula_, an _Arca_,\r\none species of which occurs in the Ganges hundreds of miles above\r\nthe tide-way (see Fig. 9, p. 14); and _Martesia_, a _Pholas_ from\r\nthe Irawadi Delta. _Clea_ (which also occurs in Java and Sumatra) is\r\nprobably an estuarine _Cominella_; a _Tectura_ has earned the name\r\n_fluminalis_ from its exclusive residence in the Irawadi R.; _Iravadia_\r\nis probably a _Rissoina_ of similar habits, occurring from Ceylon round\r\nto Hong-Kong; _Brotia_ is a _Cerithium_ from an affluent of the River\r\nSalwin, and _Canidia_ is a _Nassa_, occurring in the embouchures of\r\nrivers from India to Borneo. Nowhere else in the world is there such\r\na collection--not exhausted by this list--of marine forms caught in\r\nprocess of habituation to a fresh-water or even a land existence.\r\n\r\nThe _Andaman_ and _Nicobar_ Islands possess no peculiar features in\r\ntheir land Mollusca. They are closely related to the adjacent coasts of\r\nLower Burmah. _Amphidromus_ (2 sp.) occurs in the Andamans alone, and\r\n_Clausilia_ (2 sp.) in the Nicobars alone, while _Hyalimax_ occurs in\r\nboth groups. A remarkable _Helix_ (_codonodes_ Fér.) from the Nicobars\r\nappears to find its nearest relations in the isolated group from\r\nBusuanga and Mindoro (p. 315). Land operculates are abundant, in the\r\nNicobars actually outnumbering the pulmonates (28 to 22). _Helicina_\r\nand _Omphalotropis_, genera characteristic of small islands, are found\r\non both groups.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _Siamese Province_ includes the area occupied by the\r\ndistricts known as Siam, Laos, Cambodia, Cochin China, Annam, and\r\nTonquin. Along the whole of its northern frontier, the zoological is\r\nno more than a political boundary, while on the east the mountain\r\nranges which part Siam from Pegu and Tenasserim are not of sufficient\r\nheight to offer any effective barrier to distribution. The province is\r\naccordingly qualified to a considerable extent by Indian and Chinese\r\nelements.\r\n\r\n_Streptaxis_ is, but for three _Ennea_, the sole representative of the\r\ncarnivorous genera, and attains its maximum in the Old World. Partly\r\nowing to Chinese influence, the Helicidae, with 11 genera and 46\r\nspecies, begin to regain their position as compared with the Naninidae\r\n(12 genera, 54 species). Of the Helicidae, _Acusta_ and _Hadra_ appear\r\nnow for the first time, and, with _Plectotropis_, _Stegodera_, and\r\n_Clausilia_, form a marked Chinese element. _Amphidromus_, with 33\r\nspecies, is the most characteristic land pulmonate. Several genera,\r\nwhose nucleus of distribution lies among the islands farther east,\r\nappear to have penetrated as far as these coasts. Such are _Chloritis_,\r\n_Camaena_, and _Obbina_ among the Helicidae, _Trochomorpha_, and, of\r\nthe operculates, _Helicina_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 206.--_Cyclophorus siamensis_ Sowb., Siam.]\r\n\r\nLand operculates are very richly developed. In all, there are 17 genera\r\nand 104 species known. The tubed operculates attain their maximum,\r\nand _Cyclophorus_ is even more abundant than in India. Fresh-water\r\nbivalves abound. _Dipsas_ and _Pseudodon_ are common to China, and\r\n_Unio_ and _Anodonta_ are profusely represented. A curious resemblance\r\nto S. America appears in this group, a single _Mycetopus_ occurring,\r\nthe only species not Brazilian, while _Arconaia_ appears very closely\r\nto approach the _Hyria_ of the same locality. Several genera of the\r\n_Hydrobia_ type (_Pachydrobia_, _Jullienia_, _Chlorostracia_) are\r\npeculiar.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Land and Fresh-water Mollusca of the Siamese Province_\r\n\r\n    Streptaxis       20\r\n    Ennea             3\r\n    Helicarion        7\r\n    Microcystis       3\r\n    Sesara (?)        1\r\n    Medyla            1\r\n    Xesta             4\r\n    Macrochlamys      6\r\n    Kaliella          5\r\n    Hyalinia (?)      1\r\n    Hemiplecta       14\r\n    Rhysota           2\r\n    Trochomorpha      6\r\n    Trochomorphoides  3\r\n    Plectopylis       5\r\n    Stegodera         2\r\n    Plectotropis     12\r\n    Trachia           3\r\n    Fruticicola       2\r\n    Acusta            2\r\n    Chloritis         8\r\n    Dorcasia          1\r\n    Camaena           5\r\n    Hadra             5\r\n    Obbina            1\r\n    Amphidromus      33\r\n    Bocourtia         2\r\n    Buliminus         4\r\n    Hypselostoma      2\r\n    Tonkinia          1\r\n    Clausilia        15\r\n    Opeas             7\r\n    Spiraxis (?)      2\r\n    Subulina          1\r\n    Succinea          4\r\n    Vaginula          7\r\n    Limnaea           7\r\n    Planorbis         6\r\n    Canidia          13\r\n    Melania          39\r\n    Faunus            1\r\n    Bithynia          9\r\n    Wattebledia       1\r\n    Stenothyra        4\r\n    Hydrobia          1\r\n    Pachydrobia       9\r\n    Jullienia         6\r\n    Lacunopsis        6\r\n    Chlorostracia     4\r\n    Vivipara         39\r\n    Valvata           1\r\n    Ampullaria       15\r\n    Assiminea         7\r\n    Procyclotus       6\r\n    Dasytherium       2\r\n    Opisthoporus      5\r\n    Rhiostoma         7\r\n    Myxostoma         1\r\n    Pterocyclus       7\r\n    Cyclophorus      28\r\n    Leptopoma        10\r\n    Lagochilus        6\r\n    Pupina            8\r\n    Hybocystis        3\r\n    Alycaeus          6\r\n    Cataulus (?)      1\r\n    Diplommatina      2\r\n    Helicina          4\r\n    Georissa          2\r\n    Modiola (f. w.)   2\r\n    Dreissensia       3\r\n    Anodonta         17\r\n    Mycetopus         1\r\n    Pseudodon        18\r\n    Dipsas            4\r\n    Unio             64\r\n    Arconaia          1\r\n    Cyrena            6\r\n    Batissa           1\r\n    Corbicula        35\r\n\r\n(_c_) _The Malay Province_ includes the peninsula of Malacca south\r\nof Tenasserim, and the series of islands beginning with Sumatra and\r\nstretching eastward up to the Ké Is., besides Borneo and Celebes. The\r\nPhilippines form a separate province.\r\n\r\nThe Malay province is singularly poor in representative forms, whether\r\nwe regard it as a whole or consider the islands separately. Not a\r\nsingle genus, with the exception of _Rhodina_ (Malacca), appears to\r\nbe peculiar. The contrast with the West Indies is in this respect\r\nvery striking. Java, for instance, which is well explored, and almost\r\nexactly eleven times the size of Jamaica, has about 100 species of land\r\nMollusca, while Jamaica has about 460.\r\n\r\nThis want of individuality in the land Mollusca of the Malay islands is\r\naccounted for by a consideration of the sea depths which separate them\r\nfrom the Asiatic mainland. The accompanying map, the red line on which\r\nis intended to show what would be the result of an elevation of the sea\r\nbottom for no greater amount than 100 fathoms, exhibits clearly the\r\nfact that these islands are practically a part of Asia, a large stretch\r\nof very shallow sea extending between Siam and the greater part of the\r\nnorth-west coast of Borneo.\r\n\r\nIn all probability the three great islands of Sumatra, Java, and\r\nBorneo were united with the mainland of Asia, and with one another, at\r\na period, geologically speaking, comparatively recent. This follows\r\nfrom the general uniformity of their land Mollusca, both as regards\r\none another and as regards the mainland. Nor do the smaller members\r\nof the island series--Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, Flores, Timor, and Timor\r\nLaut--show any marked individuality in the possession of peculiar\r\ngenera. Wallace’s line is absolutely non-existent, so far as the land\r\nMollusca are concerned. The really noticeable break in distribution\r\ncomes with the Aru Is., for while the Tenimber group (Timor Laut, etc.)\r\nare decidedly Malay, and the Ké Is., in the poverty of our information,\r\nuncertain, the Aru Is. are as Papuan as New Guinea itself. The profound\r\ndepths of the Banda Sea to the north, and the Timor Sea to the south,\r\nappear to have kept the islands from Flores to Timor Laut free from the\r\nintrusion of any Moluccan or any considerable Australian element. The\r\nMoluccas, as has been already remarked, besides possessing considerable\r\npeculiarities of their own, unite a mixture of the Malay and Papuan\r\nelements, and serve as a sort of debatable ground for the meeting of\r\nthe two.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 207.--_Ariophanta Rumphii_ v. d. B., Java.]\r\n\r\nThe Malay peninsula is practically another island of somewhat the same\r\nshape and general trend as Sumatra, and about one-half the size. Its\r\ngeneral relations--and the remark applies to the great Sunda Islands as\r\nwell--appear to be rather more with Burmah, Tenasserim, and even the\r\nCingalese district, than with Siam. Points of connexion between Ceylon\r\nand Sumatra, and Ceylon and Borneo, have already (p. 304) been brought\r\nout.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Map to illustrate the\r\n    GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n    of the Land Mollusca of the\r\n    EAST INDIAN ARCHIPELAGO\r\n\r\n  _The red line marks the 100 fathom line_\r\n\r\n    London: Macmillan & Co.  _London Stanford’s Geog^l. Estab^t_.]\r\n\r\nIt seems not impossible, from the point of view of the land Mollusca\r\nonly, that the Sunda Islands may at one time have stretched much\r\nfarther into the Bay of Bengal, prolonged, perhaps, into what are now\r\nthe Andaman and Nicobar groups, while Ceylon and the western side of\r\nthe Deccan, united into one continuous piece of land, and possibly\r\nseparated from N. India by a wide stretch of sea, extended farther\r\neastward in a long island, or series of islands.\r\n\r\nJava, from its Mollusca, does not appear to hold the comparatively\r\nisolated position which its mammals and birds seem to indicate. Borneo,\r\non the other hand, is more Siamese than Java or Sumatra in respect of\r\na group whose metropolis is Siam, namely, the tubed operculates; for\r\nwhile that section is represented by 3 species in Sumatra and only 2\r\nin Java, in Borneo it has as many as 19, _Rhiostoma_ not occurring in\r\nthe two former islands at all. _Alycaeus_, _Lagochilus_, _Pupina_,\r\nand _Cyclophorus_ are found throughout, but _Hybocystis_ (Malacca, 1\r\nsp.) does not quit the mainland. Borneo is remarkably rich in land\r\noperculates, especially noticeable being the occurrence (11 sp.) of\r\n_Opisthostoma_ (Fig. 208), a most extraordinary form of land shell\r\n(Ceylon, Siam), of _Diplommatina_ (17 sp.), and _Raphaulus_. The\r\noccurrence of a single _Papuina_ (Moluccas eastward) is very remarkable.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 208.--=A=, _Opisthostoma Cookei_ E. A. Smith,\r\n  Borneo; =B=, _Opisthostoma grandispinosum_ G.-A., Borneo. Both ×\r\n  8.]\r\n\r\n_Amphidromus_ is a genus characteristic of the great Sunda Islands,\r\nattaining its maximum in Java (12 sp.). The Indian _Glessula_ still\r\nhas one species each in Sumatra, Java, and Borneo. One species of\r\n_Streptaxis_[369] occurs in Malacca, but _Ennea_ (3 sp.) reaches as\r\nfar east as Borneo and the Philippines. _Parmarion_, _Helicarion_,\r\n_Ariophanta_, and other groups of the Naninidae are well represented.\r\n_Hemiplecta_ and _Xesta_ are abundant and large, while the _Rhysota_\r\nof Borneo contain some huge sinistral forms. _Rhodina_ is a remarkable\r\nform from Malacca, whose exact generic position is not yet settled.\r\n_Clausilia_ has a few species on all the islands, the last occurring\r\non Ternate, and a single _Papuina_ (Moluccas and N. Guinea) occurs in\r\nBorneo.\r\n\r\nThe _Island of Celebes_ marks the beginning of a distinct decrease in\r\nthe Indo-Malay element. The Naninidae lose ground, in proportion to the\r\nHelicidae, _Macrochlamys_, for instance, being represented by only one\r\nspecies, and _Hemiplecta_ by four. Other characteristic genera of the\r\nIndian region dwindle, such as _Amphidromus_, _Clausilia_, the tubed\r\noperculates, and _Cyclophorus_, while _Sitala_, _Kaliella_, _Glessula_,\r\nand _Plectotropis_ disappear altogether. Comparing the total numbers\r\nof Naninidae and Helicidae from Sumatra to New Guinea, we obtain this\r\ninteresting result:--\r\n\r\n                        Sumatra  Java  Borneo  Celebes  Moluccas  N. Guinea\r\n _Nanina_ (all genera)     26     32     51       22       36       40\r\n _Helix_ (all genera)       7     11     13       14       55       91\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the proportion of Naninidae to Helicidae,\r\nwhich has been nearly 4 to 1 in Sumatra, falls to 3 to 1 in Java, and\r\nrises again to 4 to 1 in Borneo (showing the essentially continental\r\ncharacter of the island); in Celebes it further falls to 3 to 2, while\r\nin the Moluccas the scale turns and _Helix_ has the advantage by about\r\n8 to 5, and in N. Guinea by more than 2 to 1.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 209.--_Amphidromus perversus_ L., Java.]\r\n\r\nThere is the same absence of marked features of individuality in\r\nCelebes as in the islands dealt with above. Not a single genus is\r\npeculiar. The nature of the sea bottom between Borneo and Celebes,\r\nwith its indications of a somewhat broad bridge over an otherwise deep\r\nchannel of separation, would seem to account for and suggest the true\r\nexplanation of the facts as they stand. At the same time, there are\r\nindications of a certain amount of contrast between N. and S. Celebes.\r\nThe Indian element, which constitutes the preponderating majority of\r\nthe fauna, is common to north and south alike. But the north part\r\nof the island, in which _Obba_ and _Obbina_ occur, shows decided\r\nrelationship with the Philippines, while the occurrence of three\r\n_Chloritis_ and one _Planispira_ tend to approximate S. Celebes rather\r\nwith the Moluccas.\r\n\r\nThe _islands eastward of Java_, from Bali to Timor Laut and the\r\nTenimber Is., present no trace of individual peculiarities; they simply\r\ncarry on the Indo-Malay fauna as though along a great peninsula. Even\r\nTimor, surrounded as it is on all sides by sea of profound depth, shows\r\nno sign of possessing even one peculiar genus. _Amphidromus_, perhaps\r\nthe most characteristic of all Indo-Malay genera, occurs throughout,\r\ndiminishing in numbers as we go eastward (Bali, Lombok, and Sumbawa 4\r\nsp., Timor 2 sp., Timor Laut 1 sp.), while _Plectotropis_ reaches no\r\nfarther than Flores and Timor. The tubed operculates are altogether\r\nwanting. In Timor Laut we have Moluccan influence appearing in 3\r\n_Chloritis_, and there is one (supposed) _Corasia_. Two _Helices_ of a\r\nmarked Australian type (_Rhagada_) occur, one in Flores, the other on\r\nDama I., south-west of Timor. The configuration of the sea bottom (see\r\nmap) would lead us to believe that the north-west coast of Australia\r\nonce stretched a good deal nearer to these islands.\r\n\r\nThe _Moluccas_, taken as a whole, constitute a transition region\r\nbetween the Indo-Malay and the Papuan faunas, uniting, to a very\r\nconsiderable extent, the features of both. They fall into two\r\nwell-defined groups. The northern, or Ternate group, consists of Gilolo\r\n(Halmahera), Batchian, and the outlying islands as far south as and\r\nincluding Obi major. The southern, or Amboyna group, consists of Buru,\r\nCeram, Amboyna, and the chain of islands to the south-east of Ceram, as\r\nfar as, and including the Ké Is.\r\n\r\nThe Ternate group shows decidedly closer relations with New Guinea than\r\nthe Amboyna group. Thus, among the _Helices_, the markedly Papuan genus\r\n_Papuina_ is represented by 7 species in the Ternate group, but by 1 in\r\nthe Amboyna group. Again, the _Cristigibba_ section of _Planispira_,\r\nwhich is a Papuan form, has 4 representatives in the northern group,\r\nbut only 1 in the southern. Certain points of connexion with Celebes\r\ncome out in the southern group which are wanting in the northern; thus\r\nof _Chloritis_ there are 8 species in Amboyna, 0 in Ternate, 3 in\r\nCelebes.\r\n\r\nIn the Moluccas the Helicidae, for the first time as we move eastward\r\nfrom India, gain the ascendancy over the Naninidae, the numbers being,\r\n_Helix_ 55, _Nanina_ 36. If we take the groups separately, we find that\r\nin the Amboyna group the proportion is 22 to 23, while in the Ternate\r\ngroup it is 33 to 13, an additional proof that the Amboyna group is far\r\nless Papuan than the Ternate. Of _Planispira_, the most characteristic\r\nsub-genus of _Helix_, there are 12 species in the Ternate group, and 5\r\nin the Amboyna. The section _Phania_, which contains 4 species of the\r\nfinest _Helices_ known, is quite peculiar to the Ternate group. One\r\nspecies of _Obbina_, a sub-genus markedly Philippine, occurs in each\r\ngroup. Several of the Indo-Malay land operculates (_e.g._ _Ditropis_)\r\nreach their limit here, and here too we have the last _Clausilia_\r\n(strangely absent from the Amboyna group). _Amphidromus_ is not\r\nreported on sufficient authority to warrant its insertion in the list.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Land Mollusca of the Moluccas._ (T = Ternate, A = Amboyna[370] group)\r\n\r\n    Helicarion            1 A\r\n    Euplecta              1 A\r\n    Xesta            6 A, 4 T\r\n    Macrochlamys          1 A\r\n    Lamprocystis     4 A, 2 T\r\n    Macrocycloides        4 A\r\n    Sitala                1 A\r\n    Kaliella         3 A, 1 T\r\n    Trochomorpha     3 A, 3 T\r\n    Endodonta             1 A\r\n    Patula                1 A\r\n    Plectotropis          1 T\r\n    Eulota                1 A\r\n    Chloritis             8 A\r\n    Planispira      5 A, 12 T\r\n    Cristigibba      1 A, 4 T\r\n    Obbina           1 A, 1 T\r\n    Phania                4 T\r\n    Albersia              3 T\r\n    Camaena               1 T\r\n    Papuina          1 A, 7 T\r\n    Pupa                  3 A\r\n    Vertigo               2 A\r\n    Clausilia             1 T\r\n    Opeas            4 A, 4 T\r\n    Subulina              1 A\r\n    Tornatellina          1 A\r\n    Vaginula              1 A\r\n    Melania         18 A, 4 T\r\n    Faunus                1 A\r\n    Vivipara              1 A\r\n    Acmella               1 A\r\n    Diplommatina     4 A, 2 T\r\n    Registoma             1 T\r\n    Pupinella             1 A\r\n    Callia                2 A\r\n    Leptopoma        4 A, 5 T\r\n    Lagochilus       1 A, 1 T\r\n    Ditropis              3 A\r\n    Cyclotus         4 A, 6 T\r\n    Omphalotropis         3 A\r\n    Georissa              1 T\r\n    Helicina         6 A, 3 T\r\n\r\n(_d_) _The Philippine Province._--In the extraordinarily rich\r\ndevelopment of their Mollusca, the Philippines form a remarkable\r\ncontrast with the poverty of the adjacent Malay islands. No less\r\nthan 727 species of land Mollusca alone are known from the group,\r\namongst which are included some of the finest and handsomest forms\r\nyet discovered. The main features of the fauna are Indo-Malay, with\r\nthe addition of a certain Australasian element, and a remarkable\r\ndevelopment of individual characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe principal indigenous feature is the profuse abundance of the\r\ngenus _Cochlostyla_, a group of large and elegant land shells, partly\r\nhelicoid, partly bulimoid in shape, many of the species of which are\r\ncovered with a curious hydrophanous epidermis. They are in the main of\r\narboreal habits, living in the tops of the enormous forests which cover\r\nthe greater part of the islands. As many as 247 species, belonging to\r\n15 sub-genera, have been described.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 210.--_Cochlostyla_ (_Chrysalis_)\r\n  _mindoroensis_ Brod., Mindoro, Philippines.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 211.--_Cochlostyla_ (_Orthostylus_) _Portei_\r\n  Reeve, Luzon. × ⅔.]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the sub-genera of _Cochlostyla_ on the different\r\nislands of the Philippine group affords important evidence on the\r\ngeological relation of the islands to one another. Thus we find\r\n_Orthostylus_ and _Hypselostyla_ occurring in the central islands and\r\nS. Luzon, but not in Mindanao or Mindoro; we find _Chrysalis_ peculiar\r\nto Mindoro, _Prochilus_ to Mindoro and the Cuyos, _Ptychostyla_ to\r\nLuban, all these being sub-genera of very marked characteristics.\r\nSix out of the fifteen sub-genera are entirely absent from Mindanao,\r\nalthough occurring on the islands in the immediate vicinity. The\r\nlittle group Tablas-Romblon-Sibuyan are entirely deficient in certain\r\nsub-genera which occur on the islands surrounding them on all\r\nsides.[371]\r\n\r\nOther forms peculiar to the Philippines are _Diaphora_, a section of\r\n_Ennea_ with a curiously produced mouth, and several sub-genera of the\r\nNaninidae (_Vitriniconus_, _Vitrinoidea_, _Hemitrichia_). The great\r\n_Rhysota_ here find their metropolis. Another very marked group of\r\n_Helix_ is _Obbina_, 19 of the 25 known species being peculiar.\r\n\r\nThe Helicidae proper of the Philippines are still held in check, as in\r\nthe greater part of the Indian region, by the Naninidae. The single\r\n_Trachia_ and _Plectotropis_, and the 2 species each of _Plectopylis_\r\nand _Satsuma_, indicate affinities with Indo-China. Further important\r\nIndian relationships are seen in the great _Nanina_ and _Cyclophorus_,\r\nwhich here attain almost Indian dimensions; in _Kaliella_ (8 sp.),\r\n_Sitala_ (2), _Clausilia_ (1). Among the operculates we still have\r\n1 _Alycaeus_ and 1 _Coptochilus_. Singularly enough, several Indian\r\ngenera which occur here are not found in the intervening islands\r\nof Borneo, Sumatra, or Java, _e.g._ _Streptaxis_, _Hypselostoma_,\r\n_Ditropis_, _Acmella_, and _Cyathopoma_. The curiously tubed Malay\r\noperculates, _Opisthoporus_, etc., fail to reach the Philippines\r\nproper, although occurring in Borneo and N. Celebes; one of them\r\nreaches Palawan. The strikingly Malay genus _Amphidromus_ reaches\r\nPalawan, but no farther (1 sp.), while 2 species reach Mindanao, and\r\none of these penetrates as far as Bohol and S. Leyte. Amongst the\r\nslugs, _Mariaella_ occurs again only in the Seychelles, and _Tennentia_\r\nonly in Ceylon.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 212.--_Helix_ (_Obbina_) _rota_ Brod.,\r\n  Philippines.]\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Land and Fresh-water Mollusca of the Philippines_\r\n\r\n    Streptaxis        1\r\n    Ennea            10\r\n    Mariaella         3\r\n    Tennentia         1\r\n    Helicarion       21\r\n    Vitrinopsis       5\r\n    Vitrinoidea       1\r\n    Rhysota          17\r\n    Trochonanina      2\r\n    Euplecta         28\r\n    Hemiplecta       11\r\n    Hemitrichia      15\r\n    Xesta             2\r\n    Macrochlamys      5\r\n    Microcystis       3\r\n    Lamprocystis     17\r\n    Bensonia          4\r\n    Vitriniconus     16\r\n    Sitala            2\r\n    Kaliella          8\r\n    Trochomorpha     21\r\n    Endodonta         1\r\n    Plectopylis       3\r\n    Plectotropis      1\r\n    Aulacospira       3\r\n    Pupisoma          1\r\n    Satsuma           2\r\n    Dorcasia          2\r\n    Chloritis         7\r\n    Obbina           19\r\n    Papuina           1\r\n    Phoenicobius      7\r\n    Cochlostyla     247\r\n    Amphidromus       2\r\n    Hapalus (?)       4\r\n    Hypselostoma      1\r\n    Pupa              4\r\n    Clausilia         1\r\n    Subulina          3\r\n    Prosopeas         2\r\n    Opeas             4\r\n    Geostilbia        1\r\n    Tornalellina      1\r\n    Succinea          3\r\n    Vaginula          2\r\n    Ancylus           1\r\n    Limnaea           3\r\n    Planorbis         3\r\n    Physa             2\r\n    Melania          50\r\n    Pirena            2\r\n    Bithynia          1\r\n    Vivipara          7\r\n    Ampullaria        5\r\n    Acmella           2\r\n    Diplommatina     41\r\n    Arinia            6\r\n    Pupina            5\r\n    Registoma         7\r\n    Hargreavesia      1\r\n    Callia            2\r\n    Pupinella         3\r\n    Helicomorpha      4\r\n    Coptochilus       1\r\n    Alycaeus          1\r\n    Leptopoma        42\r\n    Lagochilus       11\r\n    Cyclophorus      31\r\n    Ditropis          7\r\n    Cyathopoma        5\r\n    Cyclotus         19\r\n    Omphalotropis     3\r\n    Helicina         18\r\n    Georissa          3\r\n    Anodonta          1\r\n    Cyrena            3\r\n    Corbicula         7\r\n\r\n_Islands adjacent to the Philippines._--The Philippines are connected\r\nwith Borneo by two distinct ridges or banks of elevation, which enclose\r\nbetween them the Soo-loo or Mindoro Sea. There can be little doubt\r\nthat these ridges represent the ancient highway of transit, by which\r\nIndo-Malay species passed into the Philippines. The depth of the sea on\r\neither side is profound, ranging from an average of about 1000 fathoms\r\nwest of Palawan to 2550 off the south-west coast of Mindanao.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the fauna of the Soo-loo ridge is definitely Philippine\r\nup to and including Bongao, Sibutu, and Bilatan, the last islands\r\nat the Bornean end of the ridge. On these are found two species of\r\n_Cochlostyla_ and an _Obbina_.\r\n\r\nThe Palawan ridge may also be described as more or less Philippine\r\nthroughout. One species of _Cochlostyla_ occurs on Balabac, just north\r\nof Borneo, and two on Palawan, but these are perhaps counterbalanced\r\nby the definitely Indo-Malay _Amphidromus_ and _Opisthoporus_ (1 sp.\r\neach). At the northern end of the ridge, on Busuanga and Calamian, the\r\nPhilippine element predominates.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of two remarkable groups of _Helix_ (_Camaena_ and\r\n_Phoenicobius_) occur along the Palawan ridge and in Mindoro. The\r\n_Phoenicobius_ find their nearest allies in the curious small group\r\nknown as _Obba_, from N. Celebes, the _Camaena_ possibly in a type\r\nof _Helix_ (_Hadra_) occurring in New Guinea and N.E. Australia. The\r\nonly other _Helix_ from the whole of the E. Indies which bears any\r\nresemblance to the _Phoenicobius_ group is _H. codonodes_ Pfr., which\r\nis peculiar to the Nicobars. A few forms assigned to _Camaena_ also\r\noccur in Further India and Siam. It would appear possible, therefore,\r\nthat these two isolated groups are a sort of survival of a fauna which\r\nperhaps had once a much more extended range.\r\n\r\n(2) The =Chinese Sub-region=.--The _Chinese Sub-region_ includes the\r\nwhole of China from its southern frontier up to and including the\r\nbasin of the Blue or Yang-tse River, together with the coast district,\r\nincluding Corea, perhaps as far north as Vladivostok, and the outlying\r\nislands of Hainan, Formosa, the Loo-Choo and Bonin groups, and Japan to\r\nthe north of Niphon. It may be divided into two provinces, the Chinese\r\nand the Japanese.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The fauna of the _Chinese province proper_ bears, in many\r\nrespects, strong marks of relationship to that of India and Siam. Thus\r\n_Streptaxis_, _Helicarion_, _Macrochlamys_, _Kaliella_, _Sitala_,\r\n_Ariophanta_, _Rhysota_, _Hemiplecta_, _Diplommatina_, _Opisthoporus_,\r\n_Pterocyclus_, _Lagochilus_, and _Alycaeus_ all occur, especially in\r\nSouthern China. The two points in which the sub-region bears special\r\nmarks of individuality are _Helix_ and _Clausilia_. The sub-genera of\r\n_Helix_ which have their metropolis in China are _Satsuma_, _Cathaica_,\r\n_Aegista_, _Acusta_, _Euhadra_, _Plectotropis_, and _Plectopylis_.\r\nSinistral forms (compare Fig. 213) are rather prevalent. In several\r\ncases--_e.g._ _Trichia_, _Gonostoma_, _Fruticicola_--there is a\r\nreappearance of forms which appear to belong to well-known European\r\nsub-genera. _Clausilia_ here attains a kind of second centre of\r\ndistribution, and is represented by its finest forms, which belong to\r\nseveral peculiar sub-genera. The carnivorous Mollusca are not abundant,\r\nand are represented by _Rathouisia_ (a peculiar genus of naked slug),\r\n_Ennea_, and _Streptaxis_. In the western provinces _Buliminus_ is\r\nabundant in several sub-genera, one of which appears to be the European\r\n_Napaeus_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 213.--_Helix_ (_Camaena_) _cicatricosa_\r\n  Müll., China.]\r\n\r\nThere is little which is striking in the operculates, which are most\r\nabundant in the south, and appear to be mainly derived from Indian and\r\nSiamese sources. The occurrence of _Helicina_ (3 sp.), _Omphalotropis_\r\n(1), _Leptopoma_ (2), and _Realia_ (2), is evidence of some influence\r\nfrom the far East. _Heudeia_ is a very remarkable and quite peculiar\r\nform of _Helicina_ with internal plicae, perhaps akin to the Central\r\nAmerican _Ceres_.\r\n\r\nFresh-water genera are exceedingly abundant, especially _Melania_,\r\n_Unio_, and _Anodonta_. The occurrence of _Mycetopus_ (a South-American\r\ngenus) is remarkable.

The\r\ncharacteristic Chinese groups of _Helix_ and _Clausilia_ occur, and\r\nthere is still a considerable Indian element in several species\r\nof _Streptaxis_, _Macrochlamys_, _Kaliella_, and _Alycaeus_. The\r\noccurrence of two _Amphidromus_, a genus which, though Siamese, is not\r\nfound in China or Hainan, is remarkable.\r\n\r\nThe peninsula of _Corea_ must undoubtedly be included in the Chinese\r\nsub-region. It is true that the land operculates scarcely occur,\r\nbut there are still a number of _Clausilia_, and several of the\r\ncharacteristic Chinese groups of _Helix_ are reproduced. In some points\r\nCorea appears to show more affinity to Japan than to China, four of\r\nthe _Helices_ being specifically identical with those of Japan, but the\r\npeninsula is at present too little explored for any generalisations to\r\nbe made as to its fauna in this respect.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Japanese Province._--Kobelt distinguishes four groups of\r\nMollusca inhabiting Japan (_a_) circumpolar species, actually occurring\r\nin Europe, Siberia, or N. America, or represented by nearly allied\r\nspecies (these of course do not belong to the Japanese province as\r\nsuch); (_b_) Indo-tropical species; (_c_) species which are Chinese\r\nor akin to Chinese; (_d_) peculiar species, a mixture of two forms,\r\nsouthern and northern, the latter being chiefly _Hyalinia_, _Patula_,\r\nand _Fruticicola_. Out of a total of 193 Japanese species, at least 164\r\nare peculiar.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese _Helices_ belong to sub-genera common to China\r\n(_Plectotropis_ 8, _Euhadra_ 21, _Acusta_ 23?); but the Naninidae\r\nscarcely occur at all. The principal feature of the fauna is the\r\ndevelopment of _Clausilia_, which presents some extraordinarily fine\r\nforms. One slug (_Philomycus_) is identical with an Indian species.\r\nThe operculates, which consist mainly of a few species each of\r\n_Diplommatina_, _Cyclophorus_, _Pupinella_, _Pupina_, _Helicina_, and\r\n_Georissa_, belong almost exclusively to the southern islands Kiu-siu,\r\nSikoku, and southern Niphon. The three species usually reckoned as\r\n_Japonia_ are probably forms of _Lagochilus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     =C. The Australasian Region=\r\n\r\nThis region includes all the islands of the Pacific east of the\r\nMoluccas, and falls into three sub-regions--the Papuan, the Australian,\r\nand the Polynesian.\r\n\r\n1. The =Papuan Sub-region= may be divided into--(_a_) the _Papuan\r\nProvince_ proper, which includes New Guinea, with the Aru Is. and\r\nWaigiou, the Admiralty Is., New Ireland, New Britain, and the\r\nd’Entrecasteaux and Louisiade Groups; (_b_) the _Queensland Province_,\r\nor the strip of N.E. Australia from C. York to the Clarence R. (about\r\n29° S. lat.); (_c_) the _Melanesian Province_, which includes the New\r\nHebrides, New Caledonia, with the Loyalty Is. and the Viti Is. The\r\nSolomons form a transition district between the Papuan and Melanesian\r\nprovinces, abounding on the one hand in characteristic Papuan\r\n_Helices_, while on the other they form the north-western limit of\r\n_Placostylus_, the group especially characteristic of the Melanesian\r\nprovince.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Papuan Province._--The molluscan fauna of New Guinea is the\r\nrichest and by far the most original of all the Australasian region.\r\nWe find ourselves, almost in a moment, in a district full of new and\r\npeculiar forms. New Guinea may be regarded as the metropolis of the\r\nrich Helicidan fauna, which is also characteristic of the Moluccas to\r\nthe west, of N. and N.E. Australia to the south and south-east, and of\r\nthe Solomons and other groups to the north-east. Here abound species\r\nof _Papuina_ and _Insularia_ (the latter being quite peculiar), among\r\nwhich are found, if not the largest, certainly the most finished forms\r\nof all existing _Helices_. _Chloritis_ (13 sp.), _Planispira_ (5),\r\nand _Cristigibba_ (9) are common with the Moluccas, while a tropical\r\nAustralian element is shown in _Pedinogyra_ (1) and _Hadra_ (4). Very\r\nremarkable, too, is the occurrence of one species of _Obbina_ and\r\n_Rhysota_, genera which culminate in the Philippines and here find\r\ntheir most eastward extension; while a single _Corasia_ serves to\r\nform a link between the _Corasia_ of the Philippines and those of the\r\nSolomon Is., if the latter are true _Corasia_.\r\n\r\nWe naturally find considerable traces of a Polynesian element, which\r\nappears to be principally characteristic of the eastern part of the\r\nisland. Most noteworthy in this respect is the occurrence of _Partula_\r\n(3), _Tornatellina_ (1), _Charopa_ (1), _Thalassia_ (3). As compared\r\nwith the true _Pulmonata_, the operculates are feebly represented,\r\nand the great majority are of a markedly Polynesian type. Not a\r\nsingle _Cyclophorus_ occurs; _Lagochilus_, _Alycaeus_, and all the\r\ntubed operculates, so marked a feature of the Indo-Malay fauna, are\r\nconspicuous by their absence, and the prevailing genera are _Cyclotus_,\r\n_Helicina_, and a number of sections of _Pupina_. _Leptopoma_, as\r\nin the Philippines, is strongly represented. Not that an Indo-Malay\r\nelement is altogether absent. We still have _Xesta_ (5), _Hemiplecta_\r\n(8), and even _Sitala_ (2), but the great predominance of _Helix_\r\nseems to have barred the progress, for the greater part, of the Indian\r\nNaninidae.\r\n\r\nThe slugs appear to be represented by a solitary _Vaginula_. A single\r\n_Perrieria_ is a very marked feature of union with Queensland, where\r\nthe only other existing species (_P. australis_) occurs. The solitary\r\n_Rhytida_, so far the only representative of the carnivorous group of\r\nsnails, emphasises this union still further. Little is known of the\r\nfresh-water fauna. _Melania_ (28 sp.) is predominant, but on the whole\r\nthe relations are Australian rather than Indo-Malay. _Ampullaria_ is\r\nwanting, while a decisive point of similarity is the occurrence of\r\n_Isidora_ (3 sp.), a genus entirely strange to the Oriental region, but\r\nmarkedly characteristic of the Australasian.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Land and Fresh-water Mollusca of New Guinea_\r\n\r\n    Rhytida         1\r\n    Helicarion      2\r\n    Rhysota         1\r\n    Hemiplecta     11\r\n    Xesta           2\r\n    Microcystis     3\r\n    Microcystina    2\r\n    Sitala          2\r\n    Oxytes (?)      2\r\n    Conulus         1\r\n    Trochomorpha    8\r\n    Nanina (?)      3\r\n    Charopa         1\r\n    Thalassia       3\r\n    Ochthephila(?)  1\r\n    Chloritis      13\r\n    Planispira      5\r\n    Cristigibba     9\r\n    Insularia      17\r\n    Obbina          1\r\n    Albersia        3\r\n    Hadra           4\r\n    Pedinogyra      1\r\n    Papuina        35\r\n    Corasia (?)     1\r\n    Bulimus (?)     1\r\n    Calycia         4\r\n    Partula         3\r\n    Pupa            1\r\n    Stenogyra       1\r\n    Tornatellina    1\r\n    Perrieria       1\r\n    Succinea        1\r\n    Vaginula        1\r\n    Limnaea         2\r\n    Isidora         3\r\n    Melania        28\r\n    Faunus          1\r\n    Vivipara        4\r\n    Diplommatina    1\r\n    Pupina          4\r\n    Pupinella       3\r\n    Omphalotropis   2\r\n    Bellardiella    2\r\n    Leptopoma      16\r\n    Cyclotus        5\r\n    Cyclotropis     5\r\n    Helicina       15\r\n    Unio            4\r\n    Cyrena          3\r\n    Corbicula       1\r\n    Batissa         8\r\n\r\n_Waigiou_ is practically a part of New Guinea. Twelve genera and twenty\r\nspecies of Mollusca are known, eight of the latter being peculiar. The\r\noccurrence of _Papuina_, _Insularia_, and _Calycia_ sufficiently attest\r\nits Papuan relationship. Two species each of _Albersia_, _Chloritis_,\r\nand _Planispira_ occur.[372]\r\n\r\nThe _Aru Is._ are, as we should expect from their position, and\r\nparticularly from the configuration of the adjacent sea bottom (see\r\nmap), markedly Papuan. At the same time they show unmistakable signs\r\nof long-continued separation from the parent island, for of their 36\r\nland Mollusca 15, and of their 20 fresh-water Mollusca 9 are peculiar.\r\nThe Papuan element consists in the presence of _Papuina_, _Albersia_,\r\nand _Cristigibba_. Moluccan influence is not absent, for the three\r\n_Helicina_, the _Albersia_, and one _Cyclotus_ are all Moluccan\r\nspecies. The fresh-water fauna appears to be a mixture of varied\r\nelements. The single _Segmentina_ is common to India, the _Glaucomya_\r\nto Malacca and the Philippines, while the single _Batissa_ is also\r\nfound in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Land and Fresh-water Mollusca of the Aru Islands_\r\n\r\n    Xesta         4\r\n    Microcystis   1\r\n    Hyalinia(?)   1\r\n    Trochomorpha  1\r\n    Patula        1\r\n    Eulota        1\r\n    Chloritis     5\r\n    Cristigibba   2\r\n    Albersia      1\r\n    Papuina       4\r\n    Pupa          2\r\n    Stenogyra     2\r\n    Planorbis     1\r\n    Segmentina    1\r\n    Melania      14\r\n    Leptopoma     3\r\n    Moussonia     1\r\n    Realia        1\r\n    Cyclotus      3\r\n    Helicina      3\r\n    Cyrena        2\r\n    Glaucomya     1\r\n    Batissa       1\r\n\r\nThe _Louisiades_, the _d’Entrecasteaux_, and _Trobriand Is._,\r\nand _Woodlark I._, are closely related to New Guinea, containing\r\nno peculiar genera. Each group, however, contains a considerable\r\nproportion of peculiar species, an indication that their separation\r\nfrom New Guinea dates from a very distant period. From the Louisiades\r\nare known 34 species in all, 22 of which are peculiar.\r\n\r\nThe fauna of the _Admiralty Is._, of _New Hanover_, and _New Ireland_\r\nis markedly Papuan, without any especial feature of distinction. The\r\nAdmiralty Is. contain 15 sp. _Papuina_, 7 _Chloritis_, 1 _Planispira_,\r\nand 1 _Corasia_. A single _Janella_ shows relationship with the New\r\nHebrides and with New Zealand. In New Ireland _Planispira_ (which\r\nis specially characteristic of W. New Guinea and the Moluccas)\r\nhas disappeared, but there are 7 _Papuina_ and 6 _Chloritis_. The\r\nessentially Polynesian _Partula_ is present in both groups.\r\n\r\nThe prominent feature of the Mollusca of the _Solomon Is._ is the\r\nextraordinary development of _Papuina_, which here culminates in a\r\nprofusion of species and singularity of form. The genus is arboreal,\r\ncrawling on the branches and attaching itself to the leaves of trees\r\nand underwood. Of the 140 land _Pulmonata_ known from the group, no\r\nless than 50, or 36 per cent, are _Papuina_. Ten species of _Corasia_\r\noccur, but whether the shells so identified are generically identical\r\nwith those of the Philippines, is not satisfactorily determined.\r\n_Trochomorpha_, with 22 species, here attains its maximum. _Chloritis_\r\nbegins to fail, but still has 3 species. Indo-Malay influence still\r\nappears, though feebly, in _Hemiplecta_ (3), _Xesta_ (1), and possibly\r\neven _Macrochlamys_ (1). The _Rhytida_, the 3 _Hadra_, and possibly\r\nthe _Paryphanta_ represent the Australian element. The growing numbers\r\nof _Partula_ (13), the small and inconspicuous land operculates (only\r\n22 in all, with _Helicina_ very prominent), and the almost complete\r\nabsence of fresh-water bivalves, show signs of strong Polynesian\r\naffinities. An especial link with the New Hebrides, New Caledonia,\r\nand the Viti Is. is the occurrence of _Placostylus_ (16 sp.). It is\r\nvery remarkable that this genus should occur in the Solomon Is. and not\r\nin New Ireland. The occurrence of _Streptaxis_, if authentic, is very\r\nnoteworthy, the nearest species being from the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _Land and Fresh-water Mollusca of the Solomon Islands_\r\n\r\n    Streptaxis (?) 1\r\n    Rhytida        1\r\n    Paryphanta (?) 1\r\n    Helicarion     2\r\n    Xesta          1\r\n    Macrochlamys   1\r\n    Hemiplecta     3\r\n    Microcystis    2\r\n    Trochomorpha  22\r\n    Nanina (?)     2\r\n    Patula         1\r\n    Thalassia      2\r\n    Chloritis      3\r\n    Philina        2\r\n    Hadra          3\r\n    Papuina       50\r\n    Merope         1\r\n    Corasia (?)   10\r\n    Placostylus   16\r\n    Partula       13\r\n    Succinea       1\r\n    Melania       18\r\n    Diplommatina   2\r\n    Pupina         4\r\n    Leptopoma      4\r\n    Omphalotropis  2\r\n    Cyclotus       1\r\n    Cyclotropis    2\r\n    Helicina       7\r\n    Unio           1\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Queensland Province._--The strip of coast-line from Cape\r\nYork to the Clarence R. stands apart from the rest of Australia, and\r\nis closely connected with New Guinea. There can be little doubt that\r\nit has been colonised from the latter country, since an elevation\r\nof even 10 fathoms would create (see map) a wide bridge between the\r\ntwo. Many of the genera are quite strange to the rest of Australia.\r\nLand operculates are abundant, and of a Papuan type. Several of the\r\ncharacteristic Papuan genera of _Helix_ (_Papuina_, _Chloritis_,\r\n_Planispira_) occur, while _Hadra_ attains its maximum. _Panda_,\r\n_Pedinogyra_, and _Thersites_ are three remarkable groups in a rich\r\n_Helix_ fauna. _Parmacochlea_ is a peculiar form akin to _Helicarion_.\r\nThe carnivorous Mollusca are represented by _Rhytida_, _Diplomphalus_\r\n(New Caledonia), and _Elaea_. One species of _Janella_, a slug peculiar\r\nto this region, occurs.

A single species\r\nof _Placostylus_ occurs both on Lord Howe’s I. and in the North I. of\r\nNew Zealand, but this fact, while highly interesting as indicating a\r\npossible former extension of land in a south-easterly direction, is\r\nhardly sufficient to bring these islands within the province as now\r\nlimited. The Solomon Is., although containing _Placostylus_ as far to\r\nthe west as Faro I., form, as has been already stated, a transitional\r\ndistrict to the Papuan province.\r\n\r\n_New Caledonia._--The chief features of the Mollusca are the remarkable\r\ndevelopment of the helicoid carnivorous genera _Rhytida_ (30 sp.) and\r\n_Diplomphalus_ (13 sp.), and of _Placostylus_ (45 sp.). There is a\r\nstray _Papuina_, and a peculiar form _Pseudopartula_, but _Helix_ has\r\nalmost entirely disappeared. Polynesian influence is represented by\r\n_Microcystis_ (3 sp.), the so-called _Patula_ (13 sp., many of which\r\nare probably _Charopa_), _Tornatellina_ (2 sp.), and _Helicina_ (20\r\nsp.). _Partula_ does not reach so far south, but there are two species\r\nof _Janella_. The recurrence of _Melanopsis_ (19 sp.), absent from\r\nthe whole Oriental region, is curious, and forms another link with\r\nNew Zealand. The curious sinistral _Limnaea_ (_Isidora_), common with\r\nAustralia and New Zealand, is abundant.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 215.--_Placostylus caledonicus_ Pet., New\r\n  Caledonia, × ⅔.]\r\n\r\n_The New Hebrides_ link New Caledonia and the Solomons by their\r\npossession of the typical heavy _Placostylus_ (5 sp.) of the former,\r\nand the lighter and more elegant _Charis_ (2 sp.) of the latter. There\r\nare 4 _Papuina_, and _Partula_ is abundant (18 sp.), but there is no\r\nevidence at present that the carnivorous genera or the _Melanopsis_ and\r\n_Isidora_ of New Caledonia occur.\r\n\r\n_The Fiji Is._, by the possession of 14 _Placostylus_ of the _Charis_\r\nsection, which is entirely absent from the adjacent Tonga group,\r\nform the eastern limit of the province. There appears to be only a\r\nsingle _Partula_, but the Polynesian element, especially as seen in\r\n_Navicella_ (8 sp.), _Neritina_ (20 sp.), _Helicina_ (11 sp.), and\r\n_Omphalotropis_ (11 sp.), is very strong. The _Microcystis_ (9 sp.) and\r\n_Trochomorpha_ (14 sp.) are also of a Polynesian type.\r\n\r\n(2) The =Australian Sub-region= includes the whole of Australia (with\r\nthe exception of the Queensland province) and Tasmania, with New\r\nZealand and the off-lying islands. The fauna, from the prevalence of\r\ndesert, is scanty, especially in genera. Land operculates are almost\r\nentirely wanting. _Limax_ is not indigenous, though several species\r\nhave become naturalised. The bulk of the fresh-water species belong to\r\n_Isidora_, and it is doubtful whether _Physa_ occurs at all. _Unio_\r\nhas a few species, and also _Vivipara_, but neither _Anodonta_ nor\r\n_Ampullaria_ occur. There are a few _Melania_ and _Neritina_.\r\n\r\n_Tropical South Australia._--The Mollusca are scanty, and occur chiefly\r\nin the neighbourhood of the rivers, the soil being arid, with no\r\nshelter either of trees or rocks. Fresh-water species predominate, and\r\nthe rich land fauna of Queensland is totally wanting. There are no land\r\noperculates, 6 _Hadra_, 1 _Bulimus_ (?), 1 _Stenogyra_.\r\n\r\n_West Australia._--Owing to the deserts which bound it, the Mollusca\r\nare very isolated, only one species being common with N., S., and E.\r\nAustralia. The chief characteristics are _Liparus_, a form intermediate\r\nbetween _Helix_ and _Bulimus_, and, among the _Helices_, the group\r\n_Rhagada_. There are no slugs, no carnivorous snails, and only three\r\nland operculates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   _Land Mollusca of West Australia_\r\n\r\n    Lamprocystis  1\r\n    Hyalinia      1\r\n    Patula        7\r\n    Chloritis     2\r\n    Gonostoma     2\r\n    Trachia       3\r\n    Xerophila     1\r\n    Rhagada       8\r\n    Hadra         5\r\n    Liparus      10\r\n    Pupa          4\r\n    Succinea      3\r\n    Cyclophorus   2\r\n    Helicina      1\r\n\r\nIn _Eastern and Southern Australia_ (New South Wales, Victoria, and\r\nSouth Australia) the tropical element, so abundant in Queensland,\r\nalmost entirely disappears, the last operculate (a _Helicina_) only\r\nreaching Port Macquarie, though several species of _Helicarion_ occur\r\nin the extreme south. _Hadra_ is still abundant in New South Wales (18\r\nsp.) and S. Australia (10 sp.), but becomes scarce in Victoria (2 sp.);\r\nNew South Wales has also one _Panda_ and two _Thersites_. _Cystopelta_\r\nis common with Tasmania, and one of the Janellidae (_Aneitea_) with\r\nQueensland. The carnivorous snails are represented by _Rhytida_.\r\n_Caryodes_, a bulimoid group perhaps akin to _Liparus_, is common with\r\nTasmania only.\r\n\r\n_Tasmania._--About 80 species of land Mollusca are known, not more than\r\n10 being common with Australia. No land operculates occur; _Endodonta_\r\nand _Charopa_ are rare, and _Hadra_ has entirely disappeared, but\r\n_Pupa_ and _Succinea_ occur. Carnivorous genera are represented by\r\n_Paryphanta_, _Rhytida_, and _Rhenea_. _Anoglypta_ is a peculiar\r\nsection of _Helix_, while _Caryodes_, _Cystopelta_, and _Helicarion_\r\nare common with Australia. Among the fresh-water Mollusca are a\r\n_Gundlachia_ (see p. 345), and some forms of _Amnicola_ or _Hydrobia_,\r\none of which (_Potamopyrgus_) is common only with New Zealand.[373]\r\n\r\n_The Neozealanian Province._--The Mollusca of New Zealand, with the\r\nKermadec, Chatham, and Auckland Is., are remarkably isolated. Such\r\ngenera as _Nanina_, _Partula_, _Pupa_, _Stenogyra_, _Succinea_,\r\n_Vaginula_, _Truncatella_, _Helicina_, and _Navicella_, which might\r\nhave been expected to occur, are entirely absent. The bulk of the\r\nland Mollusca are small and obscure forms, perhaps remains of a very\r\nearly type, and appear to belong to the Zonitidae, neither _Patula_\r\nnor _Helix_ occurring at all. The carnivorous forms are represented\r\nby _Schizoglossa_, a peculiar genus akin to _Daudebardia_, by\r\n_Paryphanta_, an extraordinary group of large shells with a thick\r\nleathery epidermis, and by _Rhytida_ and _Rhenea_. In spite of its\r\nextreme isolation, the general relations of the fauna are partly\r\nwith New Caledonia, partly with E. Australia. The occurrence of\r\n_Placostylus_ has already been mentioned (p. 323), and three species of\r\n_Janella_, a genus which also occurs in Queensland and New Caledonia,\r\nindicate the same affinity. _Otoconcha_ is peculiar. The fresh-water\r\nMollusca, besides the _Isidora_ characteristic of the sub-region, are\r\npartly related to New Caledonia through the occurrence of _Melanopsis_,\r\npartly to Tasmania through _Potamopyrgus_, while the peculiar _Latia_\r\nis possibly akin to _Gundlachia_ (Tasmania). The land operculates\r\nnumber only 5 genera and 14 species in all, excluding a doubtful\r\n_Diplommatina_.[374]\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Land and Fresh-water Mollusca of the Neozealanian Province_\r\n\r\n    Schizoglossa  1\r\n    Paryphanta    5\r\n    Rhytida       6\r\n    Rhenea        2\r\n    Helicarion    1\r\n    Otoconcha     1\r\n    Microcystis   1\r\n    Trochonanina  1\r\n    Phacussa      3\r\n    Thalassohelix 5\r\n    Gerontia      2\r\n    Allodiscus   10\r\n    Pyrrha        1\r\n    Therasia      7\r\n    Phenacohelix  3\r\n    Suteria       1\r\n    Flammulina   13\r\n    Laoma        23\r\n    Endodonta    10\r\n    Charopa      28\r\n    Placostylus   1\r\n    Carthaea      1\r\n    Tornatellina  1\r\n    Janella       3\r\n    Latia         2\r\n    Ancylus       2\r\n    Limnaea       5\r\n    Amphipeplea   2\r\n    Planorbis     1\r\n    Isidora       7\r\n    Melanopsis    2\r\n    Potamopyrgus  4\r\n    Paxillus      1\r\n    Lagochilus    7\r\n    Omphalotropis 1\r\n    Realia        4\r\n    Hydrocena     1\r\n    Unio          9\r\n    Sphaerium     1\r\n    Pisidium      2\r\n\r\n_Lord Howe’s I._ is remarkable as containing a _Placostylus_, which\r\nthus links the island with this province. The remainder of the fauna\r\nis Polynesian, with the exception of a species (common to the Fijis)\r\nof _Parmella_, a slug akin to _Helicarion_, _Parmacochlea_, and\r\n_Cystopelta_.\r\n\r\n(3) The =Polynesian Sub-region= includes all the island groups of the\r\ncentral and southern Pacific (except those classified in the Papuan and\r\nAustralian sub-regions), from the Pelews and Carolines in the west to\r\nthe Marquesas and Paumotus in the east, and from the Tonga group in the\r\nsouth to the Sandwich Is. in the north. It may be subdivided into (_a_)\r\nthe Polynesian province proper, and (_b_) the Hawaiian province, which\r\nincludes the Sandwich Is. only.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 216.--Characteristic Polynesian Mollusca:\r\n  =A=, _Achatinella vulpina_ Fér., Sandwich Is.; =B=, _Partula\r\n  planilabrum_ Pease, Society Is.]\r\n\r\n(_a_) The general features of the _Polynesian province_ are very\r\nsimilar throughout, although the Mollusca of each island group are\r\nin the main peculiar. The species are mostly small and obscure.\r\n_Helix_ scarcely occurs, its place being taken by small Zonitidae\r\n(_Microcystis_, _Charopa_, _Trochomorpha_, etc.), and by groups of\r\nso-called _Patula_ (_Endodonta_, _Pitys_, etc.), the exact position\r\nof which is not yet settled. _Libera_, remarkable for its method of\r\novipositing (p. 128), is peculiar to the Society and Hervey Is.;\r\n_Partula_ is almost universal, attaining its maximum (40 sp.) in the\r\nSociety Is.; _Tornatellina_, _Pupa_, and _Vertigo_ occur throughout.\r\n\r\nThe land operculates consist chiefly of _Omphalotropis_, _Pupina_,\r\n_Realia_, and _Helicina_. _Diplommatina_ and _Palaina_ are abundant\r\non the Pelews, and a _Moussonia_ occurs in the Samoa Is. _Ostodes_, a\r\nsmall form of _Cyclophorus_, is found in some of the southern groups.\r\nThe fresh-water operculates are _Melania_, _Neritina_ (including\r\n_Clithon_, a sub-genus furnished with spines), and _Navicella_; there\r\nare no Unionidae, while fresh-water _Pulmonata_ are very scarce.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The land Mollusca of the _Hawaiian province_ are distinguished\r\nby the possession of four entirely peculiar genera--_Achatinella_,\r\n_Leptachatina_, _Carelia_, and _Auriculella_. More than 300 of the\r\ntwo former genera have been described, every mountain valley of some\r\nof the islands having its own peculiar species. The destruction of\r\nthe indigenous herbage by goats is rapidly extinguishing many forms.\r\n_Partula_, and the small land operculates, so characteristic of the\r\nother groups, are, with the exception of _Helicina_, entirely wanting.\r\nThe occurrence of one of the _Merope_ group of _Helix_ (Solomon Is.) is\r\nremarkable, and there is a rich development of _Succinea_. “_Patula_,”\r\n_Microcystis_, _Tornatellina_, and the other small Polynesian land\r\n_Pulmonata_ are well represented. The presence of _Isidora_, absent\r\nfrom the central Pacific groups, is remarkable, and _Erinna_ is a\r\npeculiar genus belonging to the Limnaeidae.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n     GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF LAND MOLLUSCA (_continued_)--THE\r\n             ETHIOPIAN, NEARCTIC, AND NEOTROPICAL REGIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =D. The Ethiopian Region=\r\n\r\nThe Ethiopian region includes the whole of Africa south of the Great\r\nDesert, and Southern Arabia, together with the outlying islands,\r\nexcepting those of the Atlantidean province (p. 297).\r\n\r\nRegarded as a whole, the Ethiopian is poorest in land Mollusca of all\r\nthe tropical regions. And yet its characteristics are very remarkable.\r\nThe entire _Achatina_ group is peculiar, and takes, especially in W.\r\nAfrica, some curious forms (_Columna_, _Perideris_, _Pseudachatina_).\r\nCarnivorous Mollusca (_Ennea_, _Gibbus_, etc.) are highly developed,\r\nespecially in the south and east, the largest known helicoid form\r\n(_Aerope_) being from Natal. In the possession of these types of the\r\nAgnatha, Africa is more closely related to the Australasian than to the\r\nOriental region. The true _Cyclostoma_ are entirely peculiar to the\r\nregion, but are absent from West Africa.\r\n\r\nFresh-water Mollusca are abundant and characteristic, especially in and\r\nnear the Great Lakes. _Lanistes_, _Cleopatra_, and _Meladomus_, among\r\nthe operculates, together with _Mutela_ and _Aetheria_ (Unionidae),\r\n_Galatea_ and _Fischeria_ (Cyrenidae), are peculiar.\r\n\r\nIn its negative, as well as its positive features, the Ethiopian region\r\nis markedly isolated. Helicidae and Naninidae are equally deficient,\r\nthe former, indeed, attaining some numerical predominance in the\r\nextreme south, but the species are nearly all insignificant in size\r\nand colouring. It is only in Madagascar that _Helix_ asserts itself.\r\n_Arion_, _Limax_, _Hyalinia_, _Clausilia_, and a number of other\r\ngenera abundant along the Mediterranean, are either altogether absent,\r\nor are very scantily represented. Land operculates, so characteristic\r\nof other tropical countries, are almost entirely wanting. If we\r\ndisregard the Malagasy sub-region, there are scarcely forty species of\r\nland operculates on the whole African continent.\r\n\r\nThe Ethiopian region may be divided into three sub-regions: (1) the\r\nCentral African; (2) the South African; (3) the Malagasy.\r\n\r\n(1) =The Central African Sub-region= is bounded on the north by the\r\nGreat Desert, on the east and west by the ocean, and on the south by a\r\nline roughly drawn between the mouth of the Orange River and Delagoa\r\nBay; it also includes S. Arabia. No natural features exist which tend\r\nto break up this vast district into areas of independent zoological\r\ndevelopment. The absence of long and lofty mountain ranges, the\r\nenormous size of the great river basins, and the general uniformity\r\nof climate, equalise the conditions of life throughout. It will be\r\nconvenient to break the sub-region up into provinces, but in most cases\r\nno precise line of demarcation can be laid down.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The _Senegambian Province_ may be regarded as extending from\r\nthe mouth of the Senegal River to Cape Palmas. Only 8 genera of land\r\nMollusca are known, including 4 _Limicolaria_ and 3 _Thapsia_, with 1\r\nsmall _Cyclophorus_. Fresh-water genera are abundant, and include most\r\nof the characteristic Ethiopian forms.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The _West African Province_ extends from Cape Palmas to the mouth\r\nof the Congo, and is rich in Mollusca. The great _Achatina_, largest\r\nof land snails, whose shell sometimes attains a length of 6½ in.,\r\n_Limicolaria_, _Perideris_, and _Pseudachatina_ are the characteristic\r\nforms. The Agnatha are represented by _Ennea_, _Streptaxis_, and\r\n_Streptostele_. _Rachis_ and _Pachnodus_, sub-genera of _Buliminus_,\r\noccur also on the east coast. A special feature is the development of\r\nseveral peculiar slug-like genera, _e.g._ _Oopelta_, perhaps a form of\r\n_Arion_; _Estria_, a slug with an external shell, akin to _Parmacella_;\r\nand _Aspidelus_, a form intermediate between _Helicarion_ and _Limax_.\r\n_Claviger_, a handsome group akin to _Cerithium_, is peculiar to the\r\nestuaries of West African rivers.\r\n\r\nAbout sixteen species are known from the _Cameroons District_, but\r\nno peculiar genera occur. The _French Congo District_ has not yet\r\nbeen well explored. _Tomostele_, a genus allied to _Streptostele_, is\r\npeculiar, and _Pseudachatina_ attains its maximum.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 217.--_Columna flammea_ Müll., Princes I.]\r\n\r\n_St. Thomas and Princes Is._, in the Gulf of Guinea, are well known.\r\nPrinces I. has 22 species, 14 peculiar, and 2 common to St. Thomas\r\nonly, one of the latter being the great sinistral _Achatina bicarinata_\r\nChem. The remarkable genus _Columna_ (Fig. 217) is peculiar, and\r\n_Streptostele_ (4 sp.) attains its maximum. Peculiar to St. Thomas are\r\n_Pyrgina_, a turreted form of _Stenogyra_; _Thyrophorella_, a sinistral\r\nform of _Zonites_; and _Atopocochlis_, a large bulimoid shell, whose\r\ntrue relationships are not yet known. _Homorus_, a group of _Achatina_\r\nwith an elongated spire, occurring also in the Angola District and on\r\nthe east coast, has 4 species. No fresh-water species have as yet been\r\ndiscovered in either of the islands.\r\n\r\nThe _Angola and Benguela District_, extending from the Congo to the\r\nCunene R., probably belongs to the West African Sub-region, but until\r\nits fauna is better known it is advisable to consider it apart.\r\n_Achatina_ continues abundant, but the other characteristic West\r\nAfrican forms (_Pseudachatina_, _Streptostele_, _Perideris_) diminish\r\nor are absent altogether. No _Helix_ and only 1 _Cyclophorus_ occur.\r\n\r\n_Ovampo_, _Damara_, and _Great Namaqualand_, lying between the Cumene\r\nand Orange rivers, seem to form a transition district between the West\r\nand South African faunas. _Helix_ reappears, while the characteristic\r\nWest African genera are almost entirely wanting.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The _East African Province_ extends from about Delagoa Bay to the\r\nAbyssinian shores of the Red Sea. In general out-line the province\r\nconsists of a flat marshy district, extending inland for many miles\r\nfrom the sea; this is succeeded by rising ground, which eventually\r\nbecomes a high table-land, often desolate and arid, whose line of slope\r\nlies parallel to the trend of the coast. The Mollusca are little known,\r\nand have only been studied in isolated districts, usually from the\r\ndiscoveries of exploring expeditions.\r\n\r\nThe _Mozambique District_, from Delagoa Bay to Cape Delgado, includes\r\nno genus which does not occur on the west coast, except _Cyclostoma_\r\n(2 sp.). _Trochonanina_ (4 sp.), _Urocyclus_, a characteristic African\r\nslug (2 sp.), _Rachis_ (6 sp.), _Pachnodus_ (2 sp.), and _Achatina_ (5\r\nsp.), are the principal groups.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 218.--_Urocyclus comorensis_ Fisch.,\r\n  Comoro Is.: =G=, Generative orifice; =M=, mucous gland; =O=,\r\n  orifice leading to internal shell; =P=, pulmonary orifice; =T=,\r\n  tentacles. (After Fischer.)]\r\n\r\nThe _Zanzibar District_, from Cape Delgado to the Somali country, has\r\nthe same general features. _Meladomus_, a large sinistral _Ampullaria_,\r\nis characteristic, while _Cyclostoma_ (5 sp.) becomes more abundant.\r\n_Helix_ is still absent, but the carnivorous forms (_Streptaxis_ 2 sp.,\r\n_Ennea_ 7 sp.) are rather numerous.\r\n\r\nThe _Somali District_ is characterised by operculate groups of\r\nthe _Otopoma_ type (_Georgia_, _Rochebrunia_, _Revoilia_) whose\r\ngeneric value is rather doubtful. _Petraeus_, in an Arabian type,\r\nsupplants _Rachis_ and _Pachnodus_. _Achatina_ is nearly wanting, but\r\n_Limicolaria_ has 9 species. A few _Helix_, said to be of the _Pisana_\r\ngroup, occur.\r\n\r\nThe _District between the Great Lakes and the coast region_ is fairly\r\nwell known through recent explorations, especially those associated\r\nwith Emin Pasha. _Streptaxis_ (6 sp.) and _Ennea_ (24 sp.) are\r\nnumerous, _Helix_ is wanting, and the Naninidae are represented by\r\n_Trochonanina_ (7 sp.), and other forms at present grouped under\r\n_Nanina_ or _Hyalinia_. On the high ground _Buliminus_, _Cerastus_, and\r\n_Hapalus_ replace, to some extent, the _Achatina_ and _Limicolaria_ of\r\nthe marshy plains. Land operculates (_Cyclophorus_ 1, _Cyclostoma_ 8)\r\nare more numerous; among fresh-water genera we have _Lanistes_ (5 sp.),\r\n_Cleopatra_ (3 sp.), _Meladomus_ (1 sp.), and _Leroya_, a sinistral\r\nform with the facies of a _Littorina_. The characteristic African\r\nbivalves (_Mutela_, _Spatha_, etc.) are few in number.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Province of the Great Lakes._--The Mollusca of the four great\r\nlakes of Eastern Central Africa--Lakes Albert Nyanza (Luta Nzige,\r\n2720 ft.), Victoria Nyanza (Oukéréwé, 3700 ft.), Nyassa (1520 ft.),\r\nand Tanganyika (2800 ft.)--are well known, and supply an interesting\r\nproblem in distribution. Those of the three first mentioned lakes\r\ndiffer in no way from the rest of tropical Africa, but the Mollusca\r\nof Tanganyika include, in addition to the ordinary African element,\r\na number of peculiar operculate genera, belonging principally to the\r\nMelaniidae and Hydrobiidae. Several of these possess a solidity of form\r\nand compactness of structure which is unusual in fresh-water genera,\r\nand has led to the belief, among some authorities, that they are the\r\ndirect descendants of marine species, and that Tanganyika represents\r\nan ancient marine area. This view appears untenable. The Victoria\r\nNyanza and Nyassa are part of the same system as Tanganyika, and it\r\nis not easy to see how, if Tanganyika were once an arm of the sea,\r\nthey were not equally so, especially as they are several hundred miles\r\nnearer the Indian Ocean as at present defined. Nor, as will be seen\r\nfrom the figures given above, is there anything in the altitudes which\r\nwould make us expect anything exceptional in Tanganyika. The similar\r\ncase of L. Baikal must be compared (p. 290), where again a number of\r\nspecialised forms of _Hydrobia_ occur.\r\n\r\nOf the genera concerned, _Paramelania_ and _Nassopsis_ are forms of\r\nMelaniidae; _Tiphobia_ (Fig. 219), which is allied to _Paludomus_, is a\r\ncompact shell with angulated spinose whorls; _Lacunopsis_, _Ponsonbya_,\r\n_Limnotrochus_, and _Tanganyicia_ are probably forms of _Lithoglyphus_,\r\nsome, as their names denote, being of decidedly marine facies;\r\n_Syrnolopsis_ and _Turbonilla_ (?) look like Pyramidellidae, _Horea_\r\nand _Reymondia_ like _Rissoina_; _Bourguignatia_ appears to belong\r\nto _Vivipara_, with which has now been merged the genus _Neothauma_.\r\nRecently discovered forms from the adjacent L. Mweru are evidently of\r\nkindred origin.\r\n\r\n(_e_) The _Afro-Arabian Province_ includes Abyssinia, with S. Arabia,\r\nthe African shores of the Gulf of Aden, and Socotra. The province\r\ncontains a singular mixture of types. The high ground of Abyssinia\r\nstands like a lofty European island in the midst of a tropical plain,\r\nwith Palaearctic genera flourishing like hardy northern plants on a\r\nmountain in low latitudes. _Helix_, _Vitrina_, and _Pupa_ abound,\r\nwith a few _Clausilia_ and even a _Limax_. On the lower levels occur\r\n_Limicolaria_ (3 sp.), _Subulina_ (7 sp.), _Helicarion_, and _Homorus_,\r\nbut land operculates are entirely wanting. Characteristic of the\r\nprovince as a whole are various forms of _Buliminus_, which in Socotra\r\nare represented by two peculiar sub-genera, _Achatinelloides_ and\r\n_Passamaiella_. In S. Arabia the mixture of types produces curious\r\nresults: the _Helix_, _Clausilia_, and _Vitrina_ being Palaearctic,\r\nthe _Limicolaria_ and all the operculates Ethiopian, while the\r\nsingle _Trochomorpha_ is Indian. Indian influence, indeed, comes out\r\nunmistakably throughout the province. Thus in Socotra there are two\r\n_Cyclotopsis_, in Abyssinia two _Africarion_ (closely related to the\r\nIndian _Girasia_), two _Microcystis_, and a _Glessula_, and in the\r\nScioa district there is a _Sitala_. The fresh-water Mollusca of Socotra\r\nare Indian forms.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 219.--_Tiphobia Horei_ E. A.

Africa is the occurrence of numerous small species\r\nof Helicidae, belonging chiefly to the groups _Pella_, _Phasis_,\r\n_Dorcasia_, and _Sculptaria_, all of which are practically peculiar.\r\nCarnivorous genera are also prominent, _Ennea_ here attaining its\r\nmaximum. _Rhytida_ (to which several species still regarded as _Pella_\r\nbelong) is common only to the S. Pacific and Australasia, and forms,\r\nwith _Isidora_ among the fresh-water pulmonates, a remarkable link of\r\nconnexion. _Aerope_, the largest of all helicoid carnivorous genera,\r\nand _Chlamydephorus_, a carnivorous slug with an internal shell, are\r\npeculiar. _Achatina_ is still abundant, but _Limicolaria_ is wanting.\r\n_Livinhacea_, a form with a continuous peristome, perhaps akin to\r\n_Bulimus_; _Apera_, a form of slug; and _Coeliaxis_, a genus perhaps\r\nakin to the Papuan and Queensland _Perrieria_, are all peculiar. The\r\nland operculates, which are not numerous, are of the East African type.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Land Mollusca of the S.

American forms, the two former being especially\r\ncharacteristic of Brazil. How this mixture of genera now confined to\r\nregions so widely distant, not only from St. Helena itself, but from\r\none another, became associated here, is a problem obviously not easy\r\nof solution. The fauna is probably a remnant of a very ancient type,\r\npossibly at one time much more widely distributed. _Endodonta_ (an\r\nessentially insular form, like _Omphalotropis_) actually occurs on\r\nFernando Noronha, off the Brazil coast, and we shall see how an Indian\r\nand even a Polynesian element is present off the eastern coasts of\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\n_Ascension I._--One indigenous species, a so-called _Limax_, is all\r\nthat has ever been discovered.\r\n\r\n(3) =The Malagasy Sub-region= includes Madagascar with its attendant\r\nsatellites Bourbon, Mauritius, and Rodriguez, and the Seychelles and\r\nComoro groups. No land Mollusca are known from the Amirantes, the\r\nChagos, or from Aldabra. The special characteristics of the sub-region\r\nare the great development of the carnivorous land Mollusca (_Ennea_,\r\n_Gibbus_), the occurrence of a considerable number of true Helicidae of\r\ngreat size and beauty, and the prominence of the genus _Cyclostoma_.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _The Madagascan Province._--The land Mollusca of Madagascar,\r\nalthough as yet imperfectly known, possess a striking individuality.\r\nTwo of the chief characteristics of the Ethiopian region are the\r\npaucity of its land operculate and of its _Helix_ fauna; Madagascar\r\nis especially distinguished by the rich development of both these\r\ngroups. For size, colouring, and beauty of shape, the Helicidae of the\r\ntwo sub-genera _Ampelita_ and _Helicophanta_ rival, if they do not\r\nsurpass, any in the world. They are quite peculiar to this sub-region,\r\nnot a trace of them occurring on the Mascarenes, Seychelles, or even\r\non the Comoros. _Helicophanta_ is distinguished by the enormous size\r\nof its embryonic shell, which persists in the adult (Fig. 223), and in\r\nthis respect the group appears to be related to _Acavus_ (Ceylon, Fig.\r\n204) and _Panda_ (N.E. Australia). As is usual when _Helix_ is well\r\ndeveloped, _Nanina_ (about 12 sp.) is proportionately scanty.\r\n\r\nThe African _Bulimini_ (_Pachnodus_ and _Rachis_) are represented by\r\ntwo species, but _Achatina_, so abundant on the mainland, is scarce.\r\nTwo other groups of _Buliminus_, _Leucotaenia_ and _Clavator_, are\r\npeculiar. The presence of a single _Kaliella_, specifically identical\r\nwith a common Indian form, is very remarkable.\r\n\r\n_Cyclostoma_ proper, of which Madagascar is the metropolis, is richly\r\ndeveloped (54 sp.). Many of the species are of great size and of\r\nstriking beauty of ornamentation. Unlike its Helicidae, this genus is\r\nnot restricted to Madagascar; several species occur on the mainland,\r\n6 on the Comoros, one on the Seychelles, and 16 in Mauritius. The\r\nsub-genera _Acroptychia_ and _Hainesia_ are peculiar.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 222.--_Pachyotus auris vulpina_ Desh., St.\r\n  Helena (sub-fossil).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 223.--_Helix_ (_Helicophanta_) _Souverbiana_\r\n  Fisch., Madagascar, showing embryonic shell. × ⅔.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 224.--_Cyclostoma campanulatum_ Pfr.,\r\n  Madagascar.]\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water Mollusca of Madagascar contain further traces of Indian\r\nrelationship. Thus we find two species of _Paludomus_, a genus whose\r\nmetropolis is Ceylon, India, and Further India, and which is barely\r\nrepresented on the Seychelles and in the Somali district. _Melanatria_,\r\nwhich is peculiar to Madagascar, has its nearest affinities in the\r\nCingalese and East Indian faunas. Several of the _Melania_ and the two\r\n_Bithynia_ are of a type entirely wanting in Africa, but common in the\r\nIndo-Malay sub-region. Not a single one of the characteristic African\r\nfresh-water bivalves (_Mutela_, _Spatha_, _Aetheria_, _Galatea_, etc.)\r\nhas been found in Madagascar. On the other hand, certain African\r\nGasteropoda, such as _Cleopatra_ and _Isidora_, occur, indicating, in\r\ncommon with the land Mollusca, that an ultimate land connexion with\r\nAfrica must have taken place, but at an immeasurably remote period.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _Land and Fresh-water Mollusca of Madagascar_\r\n\r\n    Ennea                9\r\n    Urocyclus            2\r\n    Helicarion (?)       1\r\n    Macrocyclis (?)      1\r\n    Kaliella             1\r\n    Nanina (inc. sed.)   9\r\n    Ampelita            35\r\n    Helicophanta        17\r\n    Pachnodus            2\r\n    Rachis               2\r\n    Leucotaenia          2\r\n    Clavator             2\r\n    Achatina             3\r\n    Opeas                2\r\n    Subulina             3\r\n    Vaginula             4\r\n    Limnea               2\r\n    Planorbis            3\r\n    Isidora              3\r\n    Melania              7\r\n    Melanatria           4\r\n    Paludomus            2\r\n    Vivipara             1\r\n    Bithynia             2\r\n    Cleopatra            2\r\n    Ampullaria           6\r\n    Cyclophorus          2\r\n    Cyclotus (?)         1\r\n    Cyclostoma          54\r\n    Otopoma              5\r\n    Lithidion            1\r\n    Acroptychia          3\r\n    Hainesia             3\r\n    Unio                 1\r\n    Corbicula            2\r\n    Sphaerium            1\r\n    Pisidium             1\r\n\r\n_The Comoro Islands._--This isolated group possesses about 100 species,\r\nalmost all of which are peculiar. The principal feature is the rich\r\ndevelopment of _Ennea_ (30 sp.). On the whole the group shows more\r\nrelationship to Madagascar than to the mainland. Thus we have six\r\nspecies of true _Cyclostoma_, and only one _Achatina_, while among the\r\nfresh-water genera is _Septaria_, which is characteristic of the whole\r\nMalagasy Sub-region, but is absent from the mainland. The Helicidae\r\nare all of insignificant size. Peculiar to the group is the remarkable\r\ngenus _Cyclosurus_ (Fig. 152, p. 247).\r\n\r\n(_b_) _The Mascarene Province_ (Mauritius, Bourbon, Rodriguez, and the\r\nSeychelles).--The percentage of peculiar species, which is very high,\r\ncan only be paralleled in the case of some of the West Indian islands,\r\nand sufficiently attests the extreme isolation of the group from\r\nMadagascar.

It attains its maximum in Mauritius\r\n(17 sp.), with 5 sp. in Bourbon and one sub-fossil sp. in Rodriguez,\r\nwhile in the Seychelles it is absent. But the principal feature of the\r\nMascarene group is the extraordinary development of the carnivorous\r\ngenus _Gibbus_, which has 27 sp. in Mauritius, 8 in Bourbon, 4 in\r\nRodriguez; in the Seychelles, it is replaced by _Edentulina_ and\r\n_Streptostele_. The principal link with Madagascar is found in a part\r\nof the operculate land fauna. _Cyclostoma_ is present (with _Otopoma_)\r\nin several fine living forms, and the number of sub-fossil species is a\r\nclear indication that this group was, not long ago, much more abundant,\r\nfor of the 16 _Cyclostoma_ known from Mauritius 10 are sub-fossil. The\r\noperculates form a decided feature of the land fauna; thus in Mauritius\r\nthere are 32 species, or more than 28 per cent of the whole.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 225.--Characteristic Mauritian land shells:\r\n  =A=, _Gibbus palanga_ Fér.; =A´=, young of same; =B=, _Gibbus\r\n  lyonetianus_ Pall.]\r\n\r\nIndian and Australasian affinities are unmistakably present. Thus\r\n_Omphalotropis_, a genus characteristic of _small_ islands, is\r\nprofusely represented, but it does not occur in Madagascar or Africa.\r\nTwo _Helicina_ (Mauritius and Seychelles) and a single _Leptopoma_\r\n(possibly a _Leptopomoides_) are also of eastern relationship.\r\n_Cyclotopsis_, _Cyathopoma_, and _Geostilbia_ are markedly Indian\r\ngenera. _Microcystis_, _Patula_, and _Tornatellina_ are Polynesian.\r\n_Hyalimax_--and this is a very striking fact--occurs nowhere else but\r\nin the Andamans and Nicobars, and on the Aracan coast. The nearest\r\nrelation to the Seychelles _Mariaella_ appears to be the Cingalese\r\n_Tennentia_. Not a single representative of these eleven genera has\r\nbeen found even in Madagascar.\r\n\r\nThe fresh-water Mollusca (omitting the Neritidae) are: Mauritius 9\r\nspecies, Bourbon 5, Rodriguez 4, Seychelles 6, with only 15 species in\r\nall. The one _Planorbis_ and the _Vivipara_, the _Paludomus_ and two of\r\nthe _Melania_ are of Indian types. The _Lantzia_ (peculiar to Bourbon)\r\nis probably allied to the Indian _Camptonyx_. Owing to the paucity of\r\npermanent streams, no fresh-water bivalves occur. Among the Neritidae\r\nis a single _Septaria_, a genus which, though occurring in Madagascar,\r\nis entirely strange to Africa, and is abundant in the Oriental and\r\nAustralasian regions.\r\n\r\nIt would seem probable that when the closer connexion which at one\r\ntime undoubtedly existed between India and Eastern Africa began to\r\nbe less continuous,[376] the Mascarene group was first severed from\r\nwhat ultimately became Madagascar, while the Seychelles, and perhaps\r\nthe Comoros, still continued united to it. The Comoros, which lack\r\nthe great _Helices_, separated off from Madagascar first, while the\r\nSeychelles continued in more or less direct union with that island\r\nsufficiently long to receive the progenitors of _Stylodonta_ (a\r\npeculiar group of _Helix_), but became disunited at an exceedingly\r\nremote period.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =E. The Nearctic Region=\r\n\r\nThe southern boundary of this region may be regarded as roughly\r\ncorresponding to that of the United States, _i.e._ Lower California and\r\nMexico are excluded. The southern portion of Florida belongs to the\r\nAntillean sub-region.\r\n\r\nThe principal characteristic of the Nearctic Region is the remarkable\r\npoverty of its land Mollusca. No district in the world of equal extent\r\nis so poor in genera, while those which occur are generally of small\r\nsize, with scarcely anything remarkable either in colouring or form.\r\nThe elongated land shells (_Clausilia_, _Buliminus_), so characteristic\r\nof Europe, are entirely wanting, but a few _Bulimulus_, of Neotropical\r\norigin, penetrate Texas, and from the same sources come a few species\r\nof _Glandina_ (as far north as S. Carolina), _Holospira_ (Texas), and\r\n_Helicina_.\r\n\r\nThe region falls into two well-marked sub-regions, the N. American\r\nand the Californian, with the Rocky Mountain district as a sort of\r\ndebatable ground between them. The Californian sub-region consists of\r\nthe narrow strip of country between the Sierra Nevada, the Cascade\r\nMountains and the coast-line, from San Diego to Alaska; the N. American\r\nsub-region consists of the remainder of the region.\r\n\r\n(1) =The N. American Sub-region.=--The Carnivorous genera are\r\nrepresented solely by the few _Glandina_ mentioned above, and by the\r\nindigenous genus _Selenites_, a form midway between _Testacella_ and\r\n_Limax_, whose metropolis is on the Pacific slope, but which spreads\r\neastward into the Antilles. Among the Limacidae, _Limax_ is common\r\nto both sub-regions, but _Tebennophorus_ (4 sp., 3 of which belong\r\nto the genus _Pallifera_), a genus found also in China and Siam,\r\nand _Vitrinozonites_ do not occur in the Californian. _Hyalinia_\r\n(_Zonites_) is fairly abundant, especially in the groups _Mesomphix_\r\nand _Gastrodonta_ (peculiar to this sub-region), and _Hyalinia_ proper.\r\n_Patula_ is well represented. The Helicidae belong principally to\r\nthe groups _Mesodon_, _Stenotrema_, _Triodopsis_, _Polygyra_, and\r\n_Strobila_, only 6 of which, out of a total of 84, reach the Pacific\r\nslope. Land operculates are conspicuous for their almost complete\r\nabsence (see map, _frontispiece_).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 226.--Characteristic North American Mollusca.\r\n  =A=, _Helix_ (_Mesodon_) _palliata_ Say, Ohio. =B=, _Helix_\r\n  (_Polygyra_) _cereolus_ Mühlf., Texas. =C=, _Patula alternata_\r\n  Say, Tennessee.]\r\n\r\nThe poverty of the land fauna is atoned for by the extraordinary\r\nabundance and variety of the fresh-water genera. A family of\r\noperculates, the Pleuroceridae, with 10 genera and about 450 species,\r\nis quite peculiar, a few stragglers only reaching Central America and\r\nthe Antilles. The nucleus of their distribution is the Upper Tennessee\r\nRiver with its branches, and the Coosa River. They appear to dislike\r\nthe neighbourhood of the sea, and are never found numerously within\r\n100 miles of it. They adhere to stones in rapid water, and differ from\r\nthe Melaniidae of the Old World and of S. America in the absence of a\r\nfringe to the mantle and in being oviparous. They do not occur north\r\nof the St. Lawrence River, or north of U.S. territory in the west,\r\nor in New England. Three-quarters of all the known species inhabit\r\nthe rough square formed by the Tennessee River, the Mississippi,\r\nthe Chattahoochee River, and the Gulf of Mexico. The Mississippi\r\nis a formidable barrier to their extension, and a whole section\r\n(_Trypanostoma_, with the four genera _Io_, _Pleurocera_, _Angitrema_,\r\nand _Lithasia_) does not occur west of that river. The Viviparidae are\r\nalso very largely developed, the genera _Melantho_, _Lioplax_, and\r\n_Tulotoma_ being peculiar. The Pulmonata are also abundant, while the\r\nrichness of the Unionidae may be gathered from the fact that Wetherby\r\nstates[377] that in 1874 no less than 832 species in all had been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThe entire Mississippi basin is inhabited by a common assemblage of\r\nUnionidae, and a considerable number of the species are distributed\r\nover the whole of this area, Texas, and parts of E. Mexico. Some\r\nspecies have spread out of this area into Michigan, Canada, the Red\r\nRiver, and Hudson’s Bay district, and even into streams in New York\r\nwhich drain into the Atlantic. An entirely different set of forms\r\noccupy the great majority of the rivers falling into the Atlantic, the\r\nAppalachian Mountains acting as an effective barrier between the two\r\ngroups of species, which appear to mingle below the southern end of the\r\nrange. In many cases Unionidae seem to have no difficulty in migrating\r\nfrom river to river, if the distance is not extreme; they probably are\r\ncarried across overflowed districts in time of flood.[378]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 227.--_Helix_ (_Arionta_) _fidelis_ Gray,\r\n  Oregon.]\r\n\r\n(2) =The Californian Sub-region= is markedly distinct from the rest of\r\nN. America. The characteristic sombre Helices of the Eastern States\r\nare almost entirely wanting, and are replaced by _Arionta_ (20 sp.), a\r\nlarger and more varied group, which may have some affinity to Chinese\r\nforms. _Glyptostoma_ (1 sp.) is also peculiar. _Selenites_ here has\r\nits metropolis, and _Pristiolma_ is a remarkable group of small\r\n_Hyalinia_ (_Zonites_), but the larger forms of the Eastern States are\r\nwanting. Several remarkable and quite peculiar forms of slug occur,\r\nnamely, _Ariolimax_ (whose nearest relation is _Arion_), _Prophysaon_,\r\n_Hemphillia_, and _Binneya_. There are no land operculates.\r\n\r\nNot more than 15 to 20 species of the Pleuroceridae (sect.\r\n_Goniobasis_) occur west of the Rocky Mountains, and only a single\r\n_Unio_, 5 _Anodonta_, and 1 _Margaritana_, which is common to New\r\nEngland. _Pompholyx_ is a very remarkable ultra-dextral form of\r\n_Limnaea_, apparently akin to the _Choanomphalus_ of L. Baikal.\r\n_Bithynia_, absent from the Eastern States, is represented by two\r\nspecies. The general indications are in favour of the Californian fauna\r\nhaving migrated from an Old World source after the upheaval of the\r\nSierras; the American fauna, on the other hand, is purely indigenous,\r\nwith no recent Old World influence at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Land Mollusca of the Nearctic Region_\r\n\r\n    Glandina        4\r\n    Selenites       6\r\n    Limax           4\r\n    Vitrina         4\r\n    Vitrinozonites  1\r\n    Mesomphix      15\r\n    Hyalinia       22\r\n    Conulus         1\r\n    Gastrodonta     9\r\n    Pristiloma      2\r\n    Tebennophorus   4\r\n    Ariolimax       6\r\n    Prophysaon      2\r\n    Hemphillia      1\r\n    Binneya         1\r\n    Patula         18\r\n    Punctum         2\r\n    Arionta        20\r\n    Praticola       2\r\n    Glyptostoma     1\r\n    Mesodon        27\r\n    Stenotrema     11\r\n    Triodopsis     21\r\n    Polygyra       23\r\n    Polygyrella     2\r\n    Gonostoma       1\r\n    Vallonia        1\r\n    Strobila        2\r\n    Pupa           18\r\n    Vertigo         8\r\n    Holospira       2\r\n    Cionella        1\r\n    Bulimulus       6\r\n    Macroceramus    1\r\n    Succinea       21\r\n    Vaginulus       1\r\n    Helicina        2\r\n\r\n\r\n=F. The Neotropical Region=\r\n\r\nThe land Mollusca of the Neotropical Region stand in complete contrast\r\nto those of the Nearctic. Instead of being scanty, they are exceedingly\r\nabundant; instead of being small and obscure, they are among the\r\nlargest in size, most brilliant in colour, and most singular in shape\r\nthat are known to exist. At the same time they are, as a whole,\r\nisolated in type, and exhibit but little relation with the Mollusca of\r\nany other region.\r\n\r\nThe most marked feature is the predominance of the peculiar genera\r\n_Bulimus_ and _Bulimulus_, the centre of whose development appears to\r\nlie in Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia, but which diminish, both in numbers\r\nand variety of form, in the eastern portion of the region. In the\r\nforests of Central America, Venezuela, and Ecuador, and, to a lesser\r\ndegree, in those of Peru and Brazil, occurs the genus _Orthalicus_,\r\nwhose tree-climbing habits recall the _Cochlostyla_ of the Philippines.\r\nThese three groups of bulimoid forms constitute, as far as the\r\nmainland is concerned, the preponderating mass of the land Mollusca.\r\n_Helix_ proper is most strongly developed in the Greater Antilles,\r\nwhich possess several peculiar groups of great beauty. In Central\r\nAmerica _Helix_ is comparatively scarce, but in the northern portions\r\nof the continent several fine genera (_Labyrinthus_, _Isomeria_,\r\n_Solaropsis_) occur, which disappear altogether towards the south.\r\n\r\nCarnivorous land Mollusca are, so far as Central America is concerned,\r\nmore highly developed than in any other quarter of the world,\r\nparticularly in the genera _Glandina_ and _Streptostyla_. These genera\r\nalso penetrate the northern portions of the continent, _Glandina_\r\nreaching as far as Ecuador, and _Streptostyla_ as far as Peru. The\r\nGreater Antilles have also characteristic forms of these genera.\r\n_Streptaxis_ is tolerably abundant all over tropical South America, and\r\nis the one pulmonate genus which shows any affinity with the African\r\nfauna.\r\n\r\nThe slugs are exceedingly scarce. _Vaginula_ occurs throughout, and is\r\nthe only genus in any sense characteristic.\r\n\r\n_Clausilia_, in the sub-genus _Nenia_, occurs along the Andean chain\r\nfrom the extreme north (but not in Central America) as far south as\r\nBolivia. It has in all probability made its way into S. America in\r\nexceedingly remote ages from its headquarters in Eastern Asia. No\r\nspecies survives in N. America, and a single straggler is found in\r\nPorto Rico. The genera _Macroceramus_, _Cylindrella_, and _Strophia_,\r\nare characteristic West Indian forms, which are only slightly\r\nrepresented on the mainland. _Homalonyx_, a curious form akin to\r\n_Succinea_, is peculiar to the region.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 228.--_Homalonyx unguis_ Fér., Demerara.\r\n  _sh_, Shell (shown also separate); _p.o_, pulmonary orifice.]\r\n\r\nLand operculates attain a most extraordinary development in the Greater\r\nAntilles, and constitute, in some cases, nearly one-half of the whole\r\nMolluscan fauna. Several groups of the Cyclostomatidae find their\r\nheadquarters here, and some spread no farther. On the mainland this\r\nprominence does not continue. West Indian influence is felt in Central\r\nAmerica and on the northern coast district, and some Antillean genera\r\nmake their way as far as Ecuador. The whole group entirely disappears\r\nin Chili and Argentina, becoming scarce even in Brazil.\r\n\r\nAmong the fresh-water operculates, _Ampullaria_ is abundant, and\r\nwidely distributed. _Vivipara_, so characteristic of N. America, is\r\nentirely absent. _Chilina_, a remarkable fresh-water pulmonate, akin\r\nto _Limnaea_, is peculiar to Chili, Patagonia, and Southern Brazil,\r\nbut is not found in the tropical portion of the continent. Of the\r\nfresh-water Pelecypoda _Mycetopus_, _Hyria_, _Castalia_, _Leila_, and\r\n_Mülleria_ are peculiar forms, akin to the Unionidae.\r\n\r\n(1) =The Antillean Sub-region= surpasses all other districts in the\r\nworld in respect of (1) extraordinary abundance of species, (2) sharp\r\ndefinition of limits as a whole, (3) extreme localisation of the\r\nfauna of the separate islands. The sub-region includes the whole of\r\nthe half-circle of islands from the Bahamas to Grenada, together with\r\nthe extreme southern end of the peninsula of Florida, which was once,\r\nno doubt, a number of small islands like the Bahamas. Trinidad, and\r\nprobably Tobago, although containing an Antillean element, belong to\r\nthe mainland of S. America, from which they are only separated by very\r\nshallow water.\r\n\r\nThe sub-region appears to fall into four provinces:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) Cuba, the Bahamas, and S. Florida; (_b_) Jamaica; (_c_) San\r\nDomingo (Haiti), Porto Rico, and the Virgin Is., with the Anguilla and\r\nSt. Bartholomew group; (_d_) the islands from Guadeloupe to Grenada.\r\nThe first three provinces contain the mass of the characteristic\r\nAntillean fauna, the primary feature being the extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of the land operculates, which here reaches a point\r\nunsurpassed in any other quarter of the globe. The relative numbers are\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n                 Cuba  Jamaica  San Domingo  Porto Rico\r\n\r\n    Inoperculate  362    221       152            75\r\n    Operculate    252    242       100            23\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that the proportion of operculate to inoperculate\r\nspecies, while very high in Cuba (about 41 per cent of the whole),\r\nreaches its maximum in Jamaica (where the operculates are actually in\r\na majority), begins to decline in San Domingo (about 40 per cent), and\r\ncontinues to do so in Porto Rico, where they are not more than 24 per\r\ncent of the whole. These operculates almost all belong to the families\r\nCyclostomatidae and Helicinidae, only two genera (_Aperostoma_ and\r\n_Megalomastoma_) belonging to the _Cyclophorus_ group. Comparatively\r\nfew genera are absolutely peculiar to the islands, one or two species\r\nof most of them occurring in Central or S. America, but of the several\r\nhundreds of operculate species which occur on the islands, not two\r\nscore are common to the mainland.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Map to illustrate the\r\n    GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION\r\n    of the Land Mollusca of the\r\n    WEST INDIES.\r\n\r\n  _The red line marks the 100 fathom line._\r\n\r\n  London: Macmillan and C^ọ. _London: Stanford’s Geog^ḷ Estab^ṭ._]\r\n\r\nThe next special feature of the sub-region is a remarkable development\r\nof peculiar sub-genera of _Helix_. In this respect the Antilles\r\npresent a striking contrast to both Central and S. America, where the\r\nprime feature of the land Pulmonata is the profusion of _Bulimus_\r\nand _Bulimulus_, and _Helix_ is relatively obscured. No less than 14\r\nsub-genera of _Helix_, some of which contain species of almost unique\r\nbeauty and size, are quite peculiar to the Greater Antilles, and some\r\nare peculiar to individual islands.\r\n\r\nHere, too, is the metropolis of _Cylindrella_ (of which there are 130\r\nspecies in Cuba alone), a genus which just reaches S. America, and\r\nhas a few species along the eastern sea-board of the Gulf of Mexico.\r\n_Macroceramus_ and _Strophia_ are quite peculiar; the former, a genus\r\nallied to _Cylindrella_, which attains its maximum in Cuba and San\r\nDomingo, is scarcely represented in Jamaica, and disappears south of\r\nAnguilla; the latter, a singular form, resembling a large _Pupa_ in\r\nshape, which also attains its maximum in Cuba, is entirely wanting\r\nin Jamaica, and has its last representative in S. Croix. One species\r\nirregularly occurs at Curaçao.\r\n\r\nThe carnivorous group of land Mollusca are represented by several\r\npeculiar forms of _Glandina_, which attain their maximum in Jamaica and\r\nCuba, but entirely disappear in the Lesser Antilles.\r\n\r\nA certain number of the characteristic N. American genera are found in\r\nthe Antillean Sub-region, indicating a former connexion, more or less\r\nintimate, between the W. Indies and the mainland. The genera are all of\r\nsmall size. The characteristic N. American _Hyalinia_ are represented\r\nin Cuba, San Domingo, and Porto Rico; among the _Helicidae_, _Polygyra_\r\nreaches Cuba, but no farther, and _Strobila_ Jamaica. The fresh-water\r\nPulmonata are of a N. American type, as far as the Greater Antilles\r\nare concerned, but the occurrence of _Gundlachia_ (Tasmania and\r\nTrinidad only) in Cuba is an unexplained problem at present. Unionidae\r\nsignificantly occur only at the two ends of the chain of islands, not\r\nreaching farther than Cuba (_Unio_ 3 sp.) at one end, and Trinidad\r\n(which is S. American) at the other.\r\n\r\nA small amount of S. American influence is perceptible throughout the\r\nAntilles, chiefly in the occurrence of a few species of _Bulimulus_\r\nand _Simpulopsis_. The S. American element may have strayed into\r\nthe sub-region by three distinct routes: (1) by way of Trinidad,\r\nTobago, and the islands northward; (2) by a north-easterly extension\r\nof Honduras towards Jamaica, forming a series of islands of which the\r\nRosalind and Pedro banks are perhaps the remains; (3) by a similar\r\napproximation of the peninsula of Yucatan and the western extremity\r\nof Cuba. Central America is essentially S. American in its fauna, and\r\nthe characteristic genera of Antillean operculates which occur on its\r\neastern coasts are sufficient evidence of the previous existence of a\r\nland connexion more or less intimate (see map).\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Cuba_ is by far the richest of the Antilles in land Mollusca,\r\nbut it must be remembered that it is also much better explored than San\r\nDomingo, the only island likely to rival it in point of numbers. It\r\ncontains in all 658 species, of which 620 are land and 38 fresh-water,\r\nthe land operculates alone amounting to 252.\r\n\r\nCarnivorous genera form but a small proportion of the whole. There are\r\n18 _Glandina_ (which belong to the sections _Varicella_ and _Boltenia_)\r\nand 4 _Streptostyla_, the occurrence of this latter genus being\r\npeculiar to Cuba and Haiti (1 sp.) among the Antilles, and associating\r\nthem closely with the mainland of Central America, where _Streptostyla_\r\nis abundant. These two genera alone represent the Agnatha throughout\r\nthe sub-region.\r\n\r\nThere are no less than 84 species of _Helix_, belonging to 12\r\nsub-genera. Only one of these (_Polymita_) is quite peculiar to Cuba,\r\nbut of 7 known species of _Jeanerettia_ and 8 of _Coryda_, 6 and 7\r\nrespectively are Cuban. _Thelidomus_ has 15 species (Jamaica 3, Porto\r\nRico 3); _Polydontes_ has 3, the only other being from Porto Rico;\r\n_Hemitrochus_ has 12 (Jamaica 1, Bahamas 6); _Cysticopsis_ 9 (Jamaica\r\n6); _Eurycampta_ 4 (Bahamas 1).\r\n\r\nThe Cylindrellidae find their maximum development in Cuba. As many as\r\n34 _Macroceramus_ occur (two-thirds of the known species), and 130\r\n_Cylindrella_, some of the latter being most remarkable in form (see\r\nFig. 151, B, p. 247).\r\n\r\nThe land operculates belong principally to the families Cyclostomatidae\r\nand Helicinidae. Of the former, Cuba is the metropolis of _Ctenopoma_\r\nand _Chondropoma_, the former of which includes 30 Cuban species, as\r\ncompared with 1 from San Domingo and 2 from Jamaica. _Megalomastoma_\r\n(Cyclophoridae) is also Haitian and Porto Rican, but not Jamaican.\r\n_Blaesospira_, _Xenopoma_, and _Diplopoma_ are peculiar. The\r\nHelicinidae consist mainly of _Helicina_ proper (58 sp.), which here\r\nattains by far its finest development in point of size and beauty,\r\nand of _Eutrochatella_ (21 sp.), which is peculiar to the three great\r\nislands (Jamaica 6 sp., San Domingo 6 sp.).\r\n\r\nThe _Bahamas_, consisting in all of more than 700 islands, are very\r\nimperfectly known, but appear to be related partly to Cuba, partly to\r\nSan Domingo, from each of which they are separated by a narrow channel\r\nof very deep water. They are certainly not rich in the characteristic\r\ngroups of the Greater Antilles. The principal forms of _Helix_ are\r\n_Plagioptycha_ (6 sp.), common with San Domingo, and _Hemitrochus_\r\n(6 sp.), common with Cuba. _Strophia_ is exceedingly abundant, but\r\n_Cylindrella_, _Macroceramus_, and _Glandina_ have but few species.\r\nThere are a few species of _Ctenopoma_, _Chondropoma_, and _Cistula_,\r\nwhile a single _Schasicheila_ (absent from the rest of the sub-region)\r\nforms a link with Mexico.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 229.--Characteristic Cuban Helices. =A=,\r\n  _Polydontes imperator_ Montf. =B=, _Caracolus rostrata_ Pfr. =C=,\r\n  _Polymita muscarum_ Lea.]\r\n\r\n_Southern Florida_, with one or two species each of _Hemitrochus_,\r\n_Cylindrella_, _Macroceramus_, _Strophia_, _Ctenopoma_, and\r\n_Chondropoma_, belongs to this province.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Jamaica._--The land Mollusca of Jamaica are, in point of numbers\r\nand variety, quite unequalled in the world. There are in all as many\r\nas 56 genera and more than 440 species, the latter being nearly all\r\npeculiar. The principal features are the Glandinae, the Helicidae,\r\nand the land operculates. The Glandinae belong principally to the\r\nsub-genera _Varicella_, _Melia_, and _Volutaxis_, _Streptostyla_ being\r\nabsent, although occurring in Cuba and San Domingo. There are 10 genera\r\nof _Helix_, of which _Pleurodonta_ is quite peculiar, while _Sagda_\r\n(13 sp.) is common only with S.W. San Domingo (2 sp.), and _Leptoloma_\r\n(8 sp.) only with Cuba (1 sp.). The single _Strobila_ seems to be a\r\nstraggler from a N. American source. _Macroceramus_ has only 2 species\r\nas against 34 in Cuba, and of _Cylindrella_, in which Cuba (130 sp.) is\r\nso rich, only 36 species occur. The genus _Leia_, however (14 sp.), is\r\nall but peculiar, occurring elsewhere only in the neighbouring angle\r\nof San Domingo, which is so closely allied with Jamaica. The complete\r\nabsence of _Strophia_ is remarkable.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 230.--Characteristic Jamaican and Haitian\r\n  Mollusca: =A=, _Sagdae pistylium_ Müll., Jamaica; =B=,\r\n  _Chondropoma salleanum_ Pfr., San Domingo; =C=, _Eutrochatella\r\n  Tankervillei_ Gray, Jamaica; =D=, _Cylindrella agnesiana_ C. B.\r\n  Ad., Jamaica.]\r\n\r\nThe land operculates form the bulk of the land fauna, there being\r\nactually 242 species, as against 221 of land Pulmonata, a proportion\r\nnever again approached in any part of the world. As many as 80 of\r\nthese belong to the curious little genus _Stoastoma_, which is all but\r\npeculiar to the island, one species having been found in San Domingo,\r\nand one in Porto Rico. _Geomelania_ and _Chittya_, two singular inland\r\nforms akin to _Truncatella_, are quite peculiar. _Alcadia_ reaches\r\nits maximum of 14 species, as against 4 species in San Domingo and 9\r\nspecies in Cuba, and _Lucidella_ is common to San Domingo only; but, if\r\n_Stoastoma_ be omitted, the Helicinidae generally are not represented\r\nby so many or by so striking forms as in Cuba, which has 90 species, as\r\nagainst Jamaica 44, and San Domingo 35.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _San Domingo_, although not characterised by the extraordinary\r\nrichness of Cuba and Jamaica, possesses many specially remarkable forms\r\nof land Mollusca, to which a thorough exploration, when circumstances\r\npermit, will no doubt make important additions. From its geographical\r\nposition, impinging as it does on all the islands of the Greater\r\nAntilles, it would be expected that the fauna of San Domingo would not\r\nexhibit equal signs of isolation, but would appear to be influenced\r\nby them severally. This is exactly what occurs, and San Domingo is\r\nconsequently, although very rich in peculiar species, not equally so in\r\npeculiar genera. The south-west district shows distinct relations with\r\nJamaica, the Jamaican genera _Leia_, _Stoastoma_, _Lucidella_, and the\r\n_Thaumasia_ section of _Cylindrella_ occurring here only. The north and\r\nnorth-west districts are related to Cuba, while the central district,\r\nconsisting of the long band of mountainous country which traverses the\r\nisland, contains the more characteristic Haitian forms.\r\n\r\nThe Helicidae are the most noteworthy of the San Domingo land\r\nMollusca. The group _Eurycratera_, which contains some of the finest\r\nexisting land snails, is quite peculiar, while _Parthena_, _Cepolis_,\r\n_Plagioptycha_, and _Caracolus_ here reach their maximum. The\r\nCylindrellidae are very abundant, but no section is peculiar. Land\r\noperculates do not bear quite the same proportion to the Pulmonata\r\nas in Cuba and Jamaica, but they are well represented (100 to 152);\r\n_Rolleia_ is the only peculiar genus.\r\n\r\nThe relations of San Domingo to the neighbouring islands are\r\nconsiderably obscured by the fact that they are well known, while San\r\nDomingo is comparatively little explored. To this may perhaps be due\r\nthe curious fact that there are actually more species common to Cuba\r\nand Porto Rico (26) than to Porto Rico and San Domingo. Cuba shares\r\nwith San Domingo its small-sized _Caracolus_ and also _Liguus_, but\r\nthe great _Eurycratera_, _Parthena_, and _Plagioptycha_ are wholly\r\nwanting in Cuba. The land operculates are partly related to Cuba,\r\npartly to Jamaica, thus _Choanopoma_, _Ctenopoma_, _Cistula_, _Tudora_,\r\nand many others, are represented on all these islands, while the\r\nJamaican _Stoastoma_ occurs on San Domingo and Porto Rico, but not\r\non Cuba, and _Lucidella_ is common to San Domingo and Jamaica alone.\r\nAn especial link between Jamaica and San Domingo is the occurrence\r\nin the south-west district of the latter island of _Sagda_ (2 sp.).\r\nThe relative numbers of the genera _Strophia_, _Macroceramus_, and\r\n_Helicina_, as given below (p. 351), are of interest in this connexion.\r\n\r\n_Porto Rico_, with Vièque, is practically a fragment of San Domingo.\r\nThe points of close relationship are the occurrence of _Caracolus_,\r\n_Cepolis_, and _Parthena_ among the Helicidae, and of _Simpulopsis_,\r\n_Pseudobalea_, and _Stoastoma_. _Cylindrella_ and _Macroceramus_\r\nare but poorly represented, but _Strophia_ still occurs. The land\r\noperculates (see the Table) show equal signs of removal from the\r\nheadquarters of development. _Megalomastoma_, however, has some\r\nstriking forms. The appearance of a single _Clausilia_, whose nearest\r\nrelations are in the northern Andes, is very remarkable. _Gaeotis_,\r\nwhich is allied to _Peltella_ (Ecuador only), is peculiar.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: FIG. 231.--Examples of West Indian Helices: =A=,\r\n  _Helix_ (_Parthena_) _angulata_ Fér., Porto Rico; =B=, _Helix_\r\n  (_Thelidomus_) _lima_ Fér., Vièque; =C=, _Helix_ (_Dentellaria_)\r\n  _nux denticulata_ Chem., Martinique.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                _Land Mollusca of the Greater Antilles_\r\n\r\n                  Cuba.

to the south, up to Grenada (all\r\nof which are volcanic), show marked traces of S. American influence.\r\nSt. Kitt’s, Antigua, and Montserrat may be regarded as intermediate\r\nbetween the two groups. St. Thomas, St. John, and Tortola have each\r\none _Plagioptycha_ and one _Thelidomus_, while St. Croix has two\r\nsub-fossil _Caracolus_ which are now living in Porto Rico, together\r\nwith one _Plagioptycha_ and one _Thelidomus_ (sub-fossil). The gradual\r\ndisappearance of some of the characteristic greater Antillean forms,\r\nand the appearance of S. American forms in the Lesser Antilles, is\r\nshown by the following table:--\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n    |                       |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   | S |   |   |\r\n    |                       | P | S |   |   |   |   | S |   | G |   | M |   |   | t |   |   |\r\n    |                       | o | t |   | S |   |   | t |   | u |   | a | S |   | . |   |   |\r\n    |                       | r | . |   | t |   | A | . |   | a | D | r | t | B |   |   | T |\r\n    |                       | t |   | S | . | T | n |   | A | d | o | t | . | a | V | G | r |\r\n    |                       | o | T | t |   | o | g | K | n | e | m | i |   | r | i | r | i |\r\n    |                       |   | h | . | C | r | u | i | t | l | i | n | L | b | n | e | n |\r\n    |                       | R | o |   | r | t | i | t | i | o | n | i | u | a | c | n | i |\r\n    |                       | i | m | J | o | o | l | t | g | u | i | q | c | d | e | a | d |\r\n    |                       | c | a | a | i | l | l | ’ | u | p | c | u | i | o | n | d | a |\r\n    |                       | o | s | n | x | a | a | s | a | e | a | e | a | s | t | a | d |\r\n    |                       | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |\r\n    +-----------------------+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+\r\n    | Bulimulus             | 7 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 8 | 9 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 6 | 2 | 4 |\r\n    | Cylindrella           | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | . | . | . | 1 | . | 1 | 1 | 1 | . | . | 1 |\r\n    | Macroceramus          | 3 | 1 | 1 | . | 2 | 1 | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |   |\r\n    | Cyclostomatidae, etc. |23 | 4 | 1 | 5 | 1 | 1 | 1 | . | 4 | . | . | . | . | . | . | 1 |\r\n    | Dentellaria           | . | . | . | . | . | . | 1 | 1 | 8 | 5 |11 | 2 | 2 | . | 1 | 1 |\r\n    | Cyclophorus           | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | 1 | 2 | 2 | . | . | . | . | . |\r\n    | Amphibulimus          | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | 2 | 3 | 1 | . | . | . | . | . |\r\n    | Homalonyx             | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | 1 | 1 | . | . | . | . | . | . |\r\n    +---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n(_d_) In Guadeloupe we find _Cyclophorus_, _Amphibulimus_, _Homalonyx_,\r\nand _Pellicula_, which are characteristic of S. America, and nearly\r\nall recur in Dominica and Martinique. These islands are the metropolis\r\nof _Dentellaria_, a group of _Helix_, evidently related to some of the\r\nforms developed in the Greater Antilles. Stragglers occur as far north\r\nas St. Kitt’s and Antigua, and there are several on the mainland as\r\nfar south as Cayenne. Traces of the great _Bulimus_, so characteristic\r\nof South America, occur as far north as S. Lucia, where also is found\r\na _Parthena_ (San Domingo and Porto Rico). Trinidad is markedly S.\r\nAmerican; 55 species in all are known, of which 22 are peculiar, 28\r\nare common to S. America (8 of these reach no farther north along the\r\nislands), and only 5 are common to the Antilles, but not to S. America.\r\nThe occurrence of _Gundlachia_ in Trinidad has already been mentioned.\r\n\r\n_The Bermudas_ show no very marked relationship either to the N.\r\nAmerican or to the West Indian fauna. In common with the former they\r\npossess a _Polygyra_, with the latter (introduced species being\r\nexcluded) one species each of _Hyalosagda_, _Subulina_, _Vaginula_, and\r\n_Helicina_, so that, on the whole, they may be called West Indian. The\r\nonly peculiar group is _Poecilozonites_, a rather large and depressed\r\nshell of the _Hyalinia_ type.\r\n\r\n(2) =The Central American Sub-region= may be regarded as extending\r\nfrom the political boundary of Mexico in the north to the isthmus of\r\nPanama in the south. It thus impinges on three important districts--the\r\nN. American, West Indian, and S. American; and it appears, as we\r\nshould perhaps expect, that the two latter of these regions have\r\nconsiderably more influence upon its fauna than the former. Of the\r\nN. American Helicidae, _Polygyra_ is abundant in Mexico only, and\r\ntwo species of _Strobila_ reach N. Guatemala, while the Californian\r\n_Arionta_ occurs in Mexico. S. American Helicidae, in the sub-genera\r\n_Solaropsis_ and _Labyrinthus_, occur no farther north than Costa Rica.\r\nNot a single representative of any of the characteristic West Indian\r\nHelicidae occurs. _Bulimulus_ and _Otostomus_, which form so large a\r\nproportion of the Mollusca of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru,\r\ntogether with _Orthalicus_, are abundant all over the region. Again,\r\n_Cylindrella_, _Macroceramus_, and some of the characteristic Antillean\r\noperculates, are represented, their occurrence being in most cases\r\nlimited to the eastern coast-line and eastern slope of the central\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nBesides these external elements, the region is rich in indigenous\r\ngenera. Central America is remarkable for an immense number of large\r\ncarnivorous Mollusca possessing shells. There are 49 species of\r\n_Glandina_, the bulk of which occur in eastern and southern Mexico; 36\r\nof _Streptostyla_ (S.E. Mexico and Guatemala, only 1 species reaching\r\nVenezuela and another Peru); 5 of _Salasiella_, 2 of _Petenia_, and 1\r\nof _Strebelia_; the last three genera being peculiar. _Streptaxis_,\r\nfairly common in S. America, does not occur. _Velifera_ and\r\n_Cryptostracon_, two remarkable slug-like forms, each with a single\r\nspecies, are peculiar to Costa Rica. Among the especial peculiarities\r\nof the region are the giant forms belonging to the Cylindrellidae,\r\nwhich are known as _Holospira_, _Eucalodium_, and _Coelocentrum_ (Fig.\r\n232). They are almost entirely peculiar to Mexico, only 7 out of a\r\ntotal of 33 reaching south of that district, and only 1 not occurring\r\nin it at all.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 232.--Examples of characteristic Mexican\r\n  Mollusca: =A=, _Coelocentrum turris_ Pfr.; =B=, _Streptostyla\r\n  Delattrei_ Pfr.]\r\n\r\nThe land operculates are but scanty. _Tomocyclus_ and _Amphicyclotus_\r\nare peculiar, and _Schasicheila_, a form of _Helicina_, occurs\r\nelsewhere only in the Bahamas. _Ceres_ (see Fig. 18, C, p. 21) and\r\n_Proserpinella_, two remarkable forms of non-operculate Helicinidae\r\n(compare the Chinese _Heudeia_), are quite peculiar. _Pachychilus_, one\r\nof the characteristic fresh-water genera, belongs to the S.

It has been usual to\r\nseparate off the two latter countries as forming a distinct “Peruvian”\r\nsub-region; but there is, as will be seen, absolutely no line to be\r\ndrawn between the Mollusca of Peru and those of Ecuador; nor would\r\none, on geographical considerations, expect to be able to draw such\r\na line. A better method of subdivision, so far as the species of the\r\nwhole eastern portion of the region are concerned, would be to group\r\nthe Mollusca according to the altitude at which they occur, were it not\r\nthat the evidence on this point is at present but fragmentary. We know,\r\nhowever, that all along the line of the Andes certain species, more\r\nparticularly of _Bulimulus_, occupy their own zones of elevation, some\r\nascending as high as 10,000 feet above the sea, and never occurring on\r\nthe plains.\r\n\r\nIn the northern portions of this sub-region, Central American and West\r\nIndian influence is felt to a certain extent. Thus there are eight\r\n_Glandina_ and one _Streptostyla_ in Venezuela and Colombia together\r\nwith one or two species of _Cistula_, _Chondropoma_, _Proserpina_, and\r\n_Cylindrella_, while a single _Strophia_ (decidedly a straggler) occurs\r\nat Curaçao. In Demerara and Cayenne there are three or four species\r\nof _Dentellaria_. In Ecuador, however, _Glandina_ diminishes to three\r\nspecies, and in Peru disappears altogether, although one _Streptostyla_\r\noccurs. Similarly the West Indian operculates are reduced to one\r\n_Chondropoma_ (Ecuador) and disappear entirely in Peru.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 233.--=A=, _Orthalicus Deburghiae_ Reeve,\r\n  Ecuador; =B=, _Bulimus_ (_Pachyotus_) _egregius_ Jay, Brazil.]\r\n\r\nThe Helicidae are most abundant in the north and west, and are\r\nrepresented by several very striking sub-genera, some of which possess\r\nremarkably toothed apertures, and perhaps betray an ancestry common to\r\nsome of the West Indian genera. Of these, _Labyrinthus_ has 12 species\r\nin Venezuela and Colombia, 5 in Ecuador, and 3 in Peru and Bolivia;\r\n_Isomeria_ 12 in Venezuela and Colombia, 20 in Ecuador, and 2 in Peru\r\nand Bolivia; _Salaropsis_ is represented in these countries by 6, 3,\r\nand 7 species, and _Systrophia_ by 4, 5, and 8 species respectively.\r\n\r\n_Clausilia_--in the group _Nenia_--appears in some numbers along the\r\nAndes chain, the only other representative in the New World being the\r\nsolitary species occurring at Porto Rico. There have been described,\r\nfrom Venezuela and Colombia 10 species, from Ecuador 5, and from Peru\r\nand Bolivia 12.\r\n\r\nAnother marked feature of the region is the occurrence of the\r\nOrthalicidae, in the two genera _Orthalicus_ and _Porphyrobaphe_.\r\nThe latter of these magnificent forms is peculiar, while the former\r\nreaches Mexico, the West Indies, and Brazil. Ecuador, which contains 23\r\nspecies, seems the metropolis of the group.\r\n\r\n_Bulimus_ and _Bulimulus_, the former genus being peculiar to S.\r\nAmerica and the adjacent islands, are largely represented, the former\r\nin the three groups _Borus_, _Dryptus_, and _Orphnus_. These attain\r\ntheir maximum in Peru, with 25 species, but Venezuela and Colombia have\r\nas many as 17. _Bulimulus_ has been subdivided into a number of groups,\r\n_e.g._ _Drymaeus_, _Mesembrinus_, _Thaumastus_, _Mormus_, _Scutalus_,\r\nwith many others,--the exact scientific limits of which are not easily\r\ndiscernible. It must suffice here to state that Peru seems to be the\r\nheadquarters of the group with about 190 species (which probably may\r\nwell be reduced), Ecuador having about 70, and Venezuela and Colombia\r\nbetween 80 and 90.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 234.--_Rhodea gigantea_ Mouss., New Grenada.]\r\n\r\nTwo very remarkable forms belonging to the Pupidae, _Anostoma_ (Fig.\r\n154, p. 248) and _Tomigerus_, occur in Venezuela, the metropolis.\r\n_Rhodea_, another very peculiar shell (Fig. 234), whose exact family\r\nposition is uncertain, is peculiar to New Grenada. The land operculates\r\nare few in number, and in Bolivia almost disappear. They belong\r\nprincipally to _Neocyclotus_ (of which 11 species occur in Venezuela\r\nand Colombia) and _Helicina_ (10 species in the same district),\r\nbesides the stragglers already mentioned from West Indian sources, and\r\na few _Cyclophorus_. _Bourcieria_ is a form of _Helicina_ peculiar\r\nto Ecuador. _Ampullaria_, with _Ceratodes_, a peculiar planorbiform\r\nsub-genus, and _Hemisinus_, form the bulk of the fresh-water\r\noperculates.\r\n\r\n_The Galapagos._--Thirty-four species of land Mollusca, all peculiar,\r\nare known from these islands; 25 of these are forms of _Bulimulus_.\r\nThere are no Helicidae, one each of _Hyalinia_, _Leptinaria_, and\r\n_Helicina_, and two _Pupa_. The _Bulimulus_ are mostly of the group\r\n_Nesiotis_, and in their brown colour bear some outward resemblance to\r\nthe dark _Achatinella_ of the Sandwich Is., living as they do mostly\r\nunder scoriae on the ground, and not on trees. In type, however, they\r\nappear to be derived from Chili and Peru, rather than from the parts\r\nof S. America immediately contiguous. Another section (_Pleuropyrgus_\r\n2 sp.) closely resembles a marine _Chemnitzia_. The islands are all\r\nvolcanic, and are probably not the result of subsidence; thus the\r\nexisting species are not to be regarded as the relics of a more\r\nwidespread fauna, but as a new set of inhabitants.\r\n\r\n(4) =The Brazilian Sub-region.=--This immense district is very\r\nlittle known, except in the south, and it is consequently impossible\r\nto give any satisfactory account of its Mollusca. It is possible\r\nthat eventually it will be found that it falls into provinces\r\nwhich correspond more or less to (_a_) the Amazon basin; (_b_) the\r\nmountainous district in the east, drained by the Tocantins and the San\r\nFrancisco; (_c_) the Parana basin in the south central district; and\r\n(_d_) the Argentine or Pampas district in the extreme south. But at\r\npresent the data are insufficient to establish any such subdivisions,\r\nwhose existence, if proved, would have an important bearing on the\r\nproblem of the coalescence of S. America into its present form.[379]\r\n\r\nThe Agnatha are represented by _Streptaxis_ alone (17 sp.). _Helix_ is\r\nrare, but includes the peculiar _Polygyratia_ (Fig. 150 A, p. 246),\r\nwhile _Labyrinthus_ (2 sp.), _Solaropsis_ (5 sp.), and _Systrophia_\r\nare common with the Colombian Sub-region, and _Oxychona_ (4 sp.) with\r\nthe Central American. _Bulimus_ has in all 36 species, the sub-genera\r\n_Pachyotus_ (Fig. 233) and _Strophochilus_ being peculiar. _Bulimulus_,\r\nthough not so abundant as in Peru and Ecuador, has about 60 species, of\r\nwhich _Navicula_ (Fig. 235) is the most remarkable group. _Megaspira_\r\nis peculiar. _Orthalicus_ has only 4 species, while _Tomigerus_ (4 sp.)\r\nand _Anostoma_ (3 sp.) are common with Venezuela. Land operculates are\r\nscarce, and appear to include only _Neocyclotus_, _Cyclophorus_, and\r\n_Helicina_.\r\n\r\nIn Argentina, which may probably rank as a separate province, the\r\ntropical forms greatly decrease, _Streptaxis_ being reduced to\r\n2 species, and _Bulimus_ and _Bulimulus_ together to 40, while\r\n_Orthalicus_, the great Helices, and the land operculates disappear\r\naltogether. _Odontostomus_ (Fig. 236), a genus of the Pupidae, is\r\nabundant in the northern part of the province. Two or three species of\r\n_Chilina_ occur.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 235.--_Bulimulus_ (_Navicula_) _navicula_\r\n  Wagn., Brazil.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 236.--_Odontostomus pantagruelinus_ Moric.,\r\n  S. Brazil. × ½.]\r\n\r\n(5) =The Chilian Sub-region.=--The greater part of Chili, from its\r\narid and rainless climate, is unfavourable to the existence of land\r\nMollusca. _Bulimus_ (_Borus_) still has 3 or 4 species, and _Bulimulus_\r\n(_Plectostylus_ 11, _Scutalus_ 9, _Peronaeus_ 7) is fairly abundant,\r\nbut the profusion of the tropics is wanting. There are no carnivorous\r\ngenera, and only two land operculates. A remarkable form of _Helix_\r\n(_Macrocyclis_, Fig. 237) is quite peculiar, but the majority of\r\nthe species belong to two rather obscure groups, _Stepsanoda_ and\r\n_Amphidoxa_. _Chilina_, a singularly solid form of _Limnaea_ (of which\r\n8 sp., with a sub-genus _Pseudochilina_, occur in Chili), is peculiar\r\nto Chili, S. Brazil, and Patagonia. From the two islands of _Juan\r\nFernandez_ and _Masafuera_, are known several _Helix_, of Chilian\r\naffinity, several curious _Succinea_, a _Homalonyx_, _Leptinaria_,\r\nand _Nothus_, and three species of _Tornatellina_, with the almost\r\nuniversal _Limax gagates_.\r\n\r\nThe question of the existence at some remote period of a Neantarctic\r\ncontinent, which formed a communication between the three great\r\nsouthern peninsulas of the world, is one on which the Mollusca may\r\noffer evidence. Von Ihering holds that an essential difference can be\r\nobserved between certain of the Unionidae which inhabit S. America,\r\nAfrica, and Australia with New Zealand, and those which inhabit\r\nEurope, Asia, and N. America, but the point can hardly be regarded as\r\ndefinitely established at present. Something perhaps may be made of\r\nthe distribution of _Bulimus_ and _Bulimulus_. It seems difficult to\r\nexplain the occurrence of sub-fossil _Bulimus_ on St. Helena except\r\non some such lines as have been recently adduced to account for the\r\npresence of struthious birds in the Mascarenes, and possibly the\r\nform _Livinhacea_ may be a trace of the same element in S. Africa.\r\nAgain, the _Liparus_ of S. and W. Australia, with the _Caryodes_ of\r\nTasmania, and the _Leucotaenia_ and _Clavator_ of Madagascar (which\r\nall may be related to _Bulimus_), together with the _Placostylus_ of\r\nNew Caledonia and the adjacent islands, reaching even to New Zealand,\r\nand perhaps even the _Amphidromus_ of Malaysia (which are more akin to\r\n_Bulimulus_), may be thought to exhibit, in some remote degree, traces\r\nof a common ancestry.\r\n\r\nThe land operculates give no help, and, of the carnivorous genera,\r\n_Rhytida_ is a marked link between Africa and Australia, while\r\n_Streptaxis_ is equally so between S. America and Africa. As regards\r\nfresh-water Gasteropoda, _Ampullaria_ is common to S. America and\r\nAfrica, while _Isidora_ is common to Africa, Australia, and New\r\nZealand, but is altogether absent from S. America. _Gundlachia_ occurs\r\nin Florida, Trinidad, and Tasmania, but has not been detected in\r\nAfrica. It must be concluded, therefore, that the present state of\r\nthe evidence which the Mollusca can afford, while exhibiting certain\r\ncurious points of relationship between the three regions in question,\r\nis insufficient to warrant any decided conclusion.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 237.--_Macrocyclis laxata_ Fér., Chili.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n          DISTRIBUTION OF MARINE MOLLUSCA--DEEP-SEA MOLLUSCA\r\n                       AND THEIR CHARACTERISTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nMarine Mollusca may be divided roughly into Pelagic and non-Pelagic\r\ngenera. To the former division belong all Pteropoda and Heteropoda, and\r\na large number of Cephalopoda, together with a very few specialised\r\nforms of Gasteropoda (_Ianthina_, _Litiopa_, _Phyllirrhoe_, etc.).\r\nPelagic Mollusca appear, as a rule, to live at varying depths below\r\nthe surface during the day, and to rise to the top only at night. The\r\nmajority inhabit warm or tropical seas, though some are exceedingly\r\nabundant in the Arctic regions; _Clione_ and _Limacina_ have been\r\nnoticed as far north as 72°.[380]\r\n\r\nThe vertical range of Pelagic Mollusca has received attention from\r\nDr. Murray of the _Challenger_, Professor Agassiz of the _Blake_ and\r\n_Albatross_, and others. Agassiz appears to have established the fact\r\nthat the surface fauna of the sea is limited to a comparatively narrow\r\nbelt of depth, and that there is no intermediate belt of animal life\r\nbetween creatures which live on or near the bottom and the surface\r\nfauna. Pelagic forms sink to avoid disturbances of various kinds,\r\nto depths not much exceeding 150 to 200 fathoms, except in closed\r\nseas like the Gulf of California and the Mediterranean, where the\r\nbathymetrical range appears to be much greater.[381]\r\n\r\nNon-Pelagic Mollusca are, from one point of view, conveniently\r\nclassified according to the different _zones of depth_ at which\r\nthey occur. Thus we are enabled to distinguish Mollusca of (_a_)\r\nthe _littoral_, (_b_) the _laminarian_, (_c_) the _nullipore_, or\r\n_coralline_, and (_d_) the _abyssal_ zones. It must be borne in mind,\r\nhowever, that these zones cannot be exactly defined, and that while the\r\nlittoral zone may be understood to imply the area between tide-marks,\r\nand the abyssal zone a depth of 500 fathoms and upwards, the limits\r\nbetween the laminarian and the coralline, and between the coralline and\r\nabyssal zones can only be fixed approximately.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of assigning special genera or species to special\r\n‘zones of depth’ is increased by two important facts in the phenomena\r\nof distribution. In the first place, it is found that species which\r\noccur in shallow water in northern seas often extend to very deep\r\nwater in much lower latitudes. This interesting fact, which shows\r\nthe importance of temperature in determining distribution, was first\r\nestablished by the dredgings of the _Lightning_ and _Porcupine_ off\r\nthe western coasts of Europe. In the second place, a certain number\r\nof species seem equally at home in shallow and in abyssal waters, in\r\ncases where a great difference of latitude does not occur to equalise\r\nthe temperature. Thus the _Challenger_ found _Venus mesodesma_ living\r\non the beach (New Zealand) and at 1000 fath. (Tristan da Cunha); _Lima\r\nmulticostata_ in ‘shallow water’ (Tonga and Port Jackson) and at 1075\r\nfath. (Bermuda); _Scalaria acus_ from 49 to 1254 fath. (N. Atlantic);\r\nand _S. hellenica_ from 40 to 1260 fath. (Canaries). The _Lightning_\r\nand _Porcupine_ found, or record as found,[382] _Anomia ephippium_\r\nat 0 to 1450 fath., _Pecten groenlandicus_ at 5 to 1785 fath., _Lima\r\nsubauriculata_ at 10 to 1785 fath., _Modiolaria discors_ at 0 to 1785\r\nfath., _Crenella decussata_ at 0 to 1750 fath., _Dacrydium vitreum_\r\nat 30 to 2750 fath., _Arca glacialis_ at 25 to 1620 fath., _Astarte\r\ncompressa_ at 3 to 2000 fath., and _Scrobicularia longicallus_ at 20 to\r\n2435 fath. _Puncturella noachina_ has been found at 20 to 1095 fath.,\r\n_Natica groenlandica_ at 2 to 1290 fath., _Rissoa tenuisculpta_ at 25\r\nto 1095 fath. In many of these cases we are assured that no appreciable\r\ndifference can be detected between specimens from the two extremes of\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of these remarkable vagaries on the part of certain\r\nspecies, we are enabled roughly to distinguish a large number of\r\ngenera as ‘shallow-water’ and ‘deep-water’ respectively, while a still\r\nlarger number occupy an intermediate position. Among shallow-water\r\ngenera may be named _Patella_, _Littorina_, _Nassa_, _Purpura_,\r\n_Strombus_, _Haliotis_, _Mytilus_, _Cardium_, _Solen_; while among\r\ndeep-water genera are _Pleurotoma_, _Scissurella_, _Seguenzia_,\r\n_Dentalium_, _Cadulus_, _Limopsis_, _Nucula_, _Leda_, _Lima_, and\r\n_Axinus_.\r\n\r\nTheories on the geographical distribution of marine Mollusca have been\r\nrevolutionised by the discoveries of recent exploring expeditions.\r\nThe principal have been those of Torell (Swedish) (1859–61) on the\r\ncoasts of Greenland and Spitzbergen; of the _Lightning_ and _Porcupine_\r\n(British) in 1868–70, in the N.E. Atlantic, off the Scotch, Irish,\r\nFrench, and Portuguese coasts, and in the Mediterranean; of the\r\n_Challenger_ (British), under Sir C. Wyville Thomson, in 1873–76,\r\nin which all the great ocean basins were dredged or sounded; of the\r\n_Blake_ (American), under Alexander Agassiz, in 1877–80, in the West\r\nAtlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean Seas; of the _Travailleur_\r\n(French) in 1880–83, off the west coasts of France, Portugal, and\r\nMorocco, Madeira, the Canaries, and the Golfe du Lion; of the\r\n_Talisman_ (French) in 1882, off the west coast of Africa from Tangier\r\nto Senegal, the Atlantic Islands, and the Sargasso Sea; of the\r\n_Albatross_ (American) in 1891, off the west coast of tropical America;\r\nof several other vessels belonging to the U.S. Fish Commission and\r\nCoast Survey, off east American shores; and of the Prince of Monaco in\r\nthe _Hirondelle_ and _Princesse Alice_ at the present time, in the N.\r\nAtlantic and Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe general result of these explorations has been to show that the\r\nmarine fauna of very deep water is much the same all the world\r\nover, and that identical species occur at points as far removed as\r\npossible from one another. The ocean floor, in fact, with its uniform\r\nsimilarity of temperature, food, station, and general conditions of\r\nlife, contains no effectual barrier to the almost indefinite spread\r\nof species.[383] To give a few instances. The _Challenger_ dredged\r\n_Silenia Sarsii_ in 1950 fath., 1100 miles south-west of Australia,\r\nand also in 2650 fath. off the mouth of the Rio de la Plata; _Semele\r\nprofundorum_ in 1125 fath. near the Canaries, and in 2900 fath. mid\r\nN. Pacific; _Verticordia deshayesiana_ in 155 fath. near Cape York,\r\nand in 350 fath. off Pernambuco; _Arca pteroessa_ in 2050 fath. mid N.\r\nPacific, in 1000–1675 fath. west of the Azores, and in 390 fath. off\r\nthe West Indies; _Arca corpulenta_ in 1400 fath. off N.E. Australia, in\r\n2425 fath. mid-Pacific, and in 1375 fath. near Juan Fernandez; _Lima\r\ngoliath_ in 775 fath. off S. Japan, and in 245 fath. off S. Patagonia;\r\n_Pleurotoma engonia_ in 700 fath. north-east of New Zealand, and in\r\n345 fath. off Inoshima. A surprising range was occasionally found even\r\nin shallow-water species; thus _Petricola lapicida_ was discovered\r\nby the same expedition in the West Indies and N. Australia, _Cardita\r\ncalyculata_ off Teneriffe and in Bass Strait, _Arca imbricata_ off Cape\r\nYork and in the West Indies, _Modiolaria cuneata_ at Port Jackson and\r\nCape of Good Hope, _Lima squamosa_ at Teneriffe and the Philippines. In\r\nthese latter cases it is not improbable that the species lives in deep\r\nwater as well, from which it has not yet been dredged.\r\n\r\nIt follows from these considerations that any attempt to classify\r\nmarine Mollusca under Regions and Provinces can only apply to Mollusca\r\nwhich occur at moderate depths. The most important factor in the\r\nenvironment, as determining distribution, is the _temperature of the\r\nwater_, which is probably to be regarded as affecting not so much the\r\nadult Mollusca as their ova; for the adult might possibly support\r\nlife under conditions in which the ova would perish. It appears that\r\na sudden change of temperature is the most effective barrier to\r\ndistribution,[384] and may bring the range of a species to an almost\r\ninstantaneous stop, while a very gradual change will allow it to extend\r\nits range very widely.\r\n\r\nIt has been usual to classify marine Mollusca from moderate depths\r\nunder the following regions and sub-regions:--\r\n\r\n         Regions         Sub-regions\r\n\r\n                        {1.

Caribbean.\r\n                        {8. Transatlantic.\r\n\r\n\r\n=A. The Atlantic Region=\r\n\r\nincludes the whole to the eastern shores of the Atlantic, from the\r\nextreme north of the Cape of Good Hope, together with the circumpolar\r\nseas, which may be regarded as roughly bounded by the Aleutian Islands\r\nand the coast of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Arctic Sub-region_ includes the circumpolar seas, and is\r\nbounded in the N. Pacific by a line drawn between Cape Avinoff in\r\nAlaska, and Cape Lopatka in Kamchatka, so as to exclude the Aleutian\r\nIslands. On the western shores of the Atlantic the cold Labrador\r\ncurrent brings it as far south as the coast of Newfoundland, but on\r\nthe eastern shores the influence of the Gulf Stream has the contrary\r\neffect, so that the North Cape may be taken as its southern limit.\r\n\r\nThe principal genera (many species of which are common to the whole\r\nsub-region) are _Volutomitra_, _Buccinum_, _Buccinopsis_, _Neptunea_,\r\n_Trophon_, _Bela_, _Admete_, _Velutina_, _Trichotropis_, _Lacuna_,\r\n_Margarita_, _Philine_, _Pecten_, _Leda_, _Yoldia_, _Astarte_, and\r\n_Mya_. The shells are generally unicoloured, and of a dead white or\r\nrather sombre tint.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Boreal Sub-region_ may be subdivided into two provinces, the\r\nEuropean and the American. The former includes the entire coast-line\r\nof Norway, the Färoe Islands, and Iceland (except perhaps the northern\r\ncoast), and possibly the Shetland Islands; the latter the American\r\ncoasts from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Cape Cod (lat. 42°). Thus the\r\nBoreal American province does not extend nearly so far south as the\r\nBoreal European, the reason being that on the American coasts the\r\ncold Labrador current, which hugs the land, bars back the advance of\r\nsouthern genera, but allows Boreal genera to spread southwards, while\r\non the European side the warmer conditions produced by the Gulf Stream\r\nkeep the Boreal species back, and allow more southern forms to spread\r\nnorthwards.\r\n\r\nMany of the Boreal species occur on both sides of the Atlantic, and\r\nthus support the theory of a more continuous fringe of continental land\r\nonce existing along the north of the Atlantic. Among the prominent\r\ngenera, besides several of those mentioned under the Arctic Sub-region,\r\nare _Purpura_, _Chenopus_, _Littorina_, _Gibbula_, _Natica_, _Patella_,\r\n_Tectura_, _Chiton_, _Doris_, _Aeolis_, _Tellina_, _Thracia_.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Celtic Sub-region_ includes the British Islands (excepting\r\nperhaps the Shetland Islands), the coasts of the North Sea and the\r\nBaltic, with N. France to Cape Ushant. The absence of any cold or\r\nwarm current exerting direct influence upon the coast-line of this\r\nsub-region causes a very gradual change in the conditions of life\r\nas we move either southward or northward. The fauna of the British\r\nseas contains a decided mixture of northern and southern forms. The\r\nfollowing are among the common Boreal species which attain their\r\nsouthward range on our coasts: _Tectura testudinalis_ Müll. (to Dublin\r\nBay and Scarborough), _Trichotropis borealis_ Brod. (to the Dogger\r\nBank), _Margarita helicina_ Fabr. (to Yorkshire and Dublin Bay), _M.\r\ngroenlandica_ Chem. (western Scotland), _Natica montacuti_ Forb. (to\r\nCornwall), _Trophon truncatus_ Str. (to Tenby), _Chiton marmoreus_\r\nFabr. (to Dublin Bay and Scarborough). _Buccinum undatum_ and\r\n_Littorina littorea_ become very scarce on our extreme south-western\r\ncoasts. Among Lusitanian species which reach our coasts are _Gibbula\r\nmagus_ L. (to Orkney and Shetland Islands), _Phasianella pullus_ L.\r\n(to Caithness), _Galerus chinensis_ L. (to Milford Haven), _Galeomma\r\nTurtoni_ Turt. (to Weymouth), _Cardium aculeatum_ L. (to Isle of Man),\r\n_Solen vagina_ L. (to north Ireland).\r\n\r\nIt appears from the Mollusca of our Crag formations that at the\r\ntime of their deposition the temperature of our seas must have been\r\nconsiderably warmer than it is now. Thus in the Crag we find many\r\nspecies and even genera (_e.g._ _Mitra_, _Fossarus_, _Triton_,\r\n_Vermetus_, _Ringicula_, _Chama_) which now occur no farther north\r\nthan the southern coasts of the Channel, the west of France, and the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nThe Baltic, a sea specially liable to violent changes of temperature,\r\nwith a large admixture of fresh water at its eastern end, appears to\r\npossess only about 65 species in all. More than 50 genera occurring on\r\nthe western coasts of Denmark do not enter the Sound. In the eastern\r\nportion of the Baltic marine and fresh-water species live together (p.\r\n12).\r\n\r\n(4) _The Lusitanian Sub-region_ extends from Cape Ushant in the north\r\nto Cape Juby (lat. 28°) in the south, and includes the whole of the\r\nMediterranean, as well as the Azores, Canaries, and Madeira groups.\r\n\r\nThe English Channel acts as an effectual barrier to the northward\r\nextension of many species; as many as 81 species which occur in\r\nwestern France do not reach British coasts (P. Fischer). At the same\r\ntime, the western coasts of France are rather intermediate between\r\nthe two sub-regions than distinctly Lusitanian, for between 50 and 60\r\nMediterranean genera do not occur on those coasts.\r\n\r\nThe Mediterranean itself is exceedingly rich in species, about 1200\r\nin all (including deep-water species) being known. A certain number\r\nof these belong to tropical genera which here find their northern\r\nlimit, _e.g._ _Fasciolaria_, _Cancellaria_, _Sigaretus_, _Siliquaria_,\r\n_Chama_, _Spondylus_. Here too occur _Carinaria_, _Lobiger_, _Oxynoe_,\r\n_Pedicularia_, _Cypraea_, _Marginella_, _Mitra_, _Dolium_, _Cassis_,\r\n_Cassidaria_, _Pisania_, _Euthria_, _Vermetus_, _Argonauta_, and many\r\nothers. A few Celtic and even Boreal species, which occur on the\r\nwestern coasts of Morocco, do not enter the Mediterranean. Among these\r\nare _Purpura lapillus_, _Helcion pellucidum_, and _Tellina balthica_.\r\n_Halia_, a rare West African genus akin to _Pleurotoma_, is found in\r\nCadiz Bay, and the West African _Cymbium_ occurs on the Spanish coasts\r\nas far as Malaga.\r\n\r\nThe Black Sea, whose northern and western coasts are exceedingly\r\ncold, is comparatively poor in species. The Sea of Azof is chiefly\r\ncharacterised by forms of _Cardium_.\r\n\r\n(5) _The West African Sub-region_ extends from Cape Juby to a point\r\nprobably not very far south of lat. 30° S., the cold current which\r\nsweeps up from the Pole probably limiting the southward extension of\r\ntropical species on this side of Africa, while the warm Mozambique\r\ncurrent on the eastern side permits the spread of many Indo-Pacific\r\nspecies almost as far south as the Cape. Owing to its extreme\r\nunhealthiness, and the absence of harbours, the sub-region is very\r\nlittle known.\r\n\r\nThe principal genera are _Cymbium_, _Pleurotoma_, _Marginella_,\r\n_Terebra_, _Mitra_, _Agaronia_, _Murex_, _Cancellaria_, _Purpura_,\r\n_Pseudoliva_, _Natica_, _Tellina_, _Lucina_, _Tugonia_, _Schizodesma_,\r\nand _Arca_. Studer has enumerated as many as 55 species common to West\r\nAfrica and the opposite American shores. The north and south equatorial\r\ncurrents, which circulate in this part of the Atlantic, probably\r\ntransport the larvae from one coast to the other. _Purpura coronata_\r\nLam., a characteristic West African species, is represented by a\r\nwell-marked variety in Demerara.\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca of St. Helena (178 known species) most resemble those of\r\nthe West Indies, 50 per cent being common, while 30 per cent are common\r\nto the Mediterranean. From Ascension Island only 33 species are known,\r\nwhich in their general relations resemble those of St. Helena.[385]\r\n\r\n(6) _The South African Sub-region_ extends along the coast from about\r\nlat. 30° on the west, to about East London on the east. Mr. G. B.\r\nSowerby enumerates 740 species from ‘South Africa,’ but includes in\r\nthis list Natal species, which more properly belong to the Indo-Pacific\r\nfauna. Of these 740, 323 are peculiar, while 67 also occur in European\r\nseas, some being familiar on our own shores. It is remarkable to\r\nfind in a sub-region separated from ourselves by the whole width\r\nof the tropics, such well-known forms as _Mangilia costata_ Don.,\r\n_M. septangularis_ Mont., _Cylichna cylindracea_ Penn., _Pholas\r\ndactylus_ L., _Solen marginatus_ Pult., _Cultellus pellucidus_ Penn.,\r\n_Ceratisolen legumen_ L., _Lutraria oblonga_ Chem., _Tellina fabula_\r\nGmel., _T. tenuis_ Da C., _Modiolaria discors_ L., and many others.\r\n\r\nThe leading genera are _Euthria_, _Triton_, _Cominella_, _Bullia_,\r\n_Nassa_, _Cypraeovula_, _Oxystele_, _Fissurella_, _Fissurellidaea_,\r\n_Patella_, and _Chiton_.\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca of Kerguelen Island and the Marion and Crozets groups\r\nshow relationship partly with South America, partly with the Cape, and\r\npartly with South Australia and New Zealand, thus showing some trace\r\nof a circumpolar antarctic fauna corresponding to, but not nearly so\r\nwell marked as that of the circumpolar arctic sub-region. Among the\r\nremarkable forms discovered off Kerguelen are _Neobuccinum_ and a\r\nsub-genus of _Struthiolaria_ (_Perissodonta_).\r\n\r\n\r\n                     =B. The Indo-Pacific Region=\r\n\r\nincludes the whole of the coast-line of the Indian and western Pacific\r\noceans, from about East London in South Africa to the north of Niphon\r\n(lat. 42°) in Japan, with the Red Sea and Persian Gulf, the whole of\r\nthe Indo-Malay Archipelago, Polynesia to the Sandwich Islands in the\r\nnorth-east, and Easter Island in the south-east, and Australia to Swan\r\nRiver in the west, and to Sandy Cape and Lord Howe’s Island in the\r\neast. It is especially the region of coral reefs, which furnish so\r\nfavourite a home of the Mollusca, and which are entirely absent from\r\nthe Atlantic Region.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Indo-Pacific Sub-region proper_ (which includes the whole of\r\nthis region except that part defined below as the Japanese Sub-region)\r\nis by far the richest in the world. The marine Mollusca of the\r\nPhilippines alone (in some respects the nucleus of the whole region)\r\nhave been estimated at between 5000 and 6000 species, and Jousseaume\r\nestimates Red Sea species at about 1000. Some prominent genera are\r\nvery rich in species. Garrett enumerates from Polynesia 81 species of\r\n_Conus_, 60 of which occur on the Viti Is., 21 on the Sandwich Is.,\r\nand only 14 on the Marquesas, where coral reefs are almost absent; 82\r\nspecies of _Cypraea_, Viti Is. 44, Sandwich Is. 31, Marquesas only 13;\r\n167 species of _Mitra_ (besides 29 recorded by others), Viti Is. 120,\r\nSandwich Is. 36, Marquesas 7. Of 50 existing species of _Strombus_, 39\r\noccur in this region, and 10 out of 11 _Eburna_.\r\n\r\nThe following important genera are quite peculiar to the region:\r\n_Nautilus_, several forms of Purpuridae, _e.g._ _Rapana_, _Magilus_,\r\n_Rapa_, _Melapium_, and _Ricinula_; _Tudicla_, several forms of\r\nStrombidae, _e.g._ _Rostellaria_, _Terebellum_, _Pteroceras_, and\r\n_Rimella_; _Cithara_, _Melo_, _Neritopsis_, _Stomatia_, _Malleus_,\r\n_Vulsella_, _Cucullaea_, _Tridacna_, _Hippopus_, _Libitina_,\r\n_Glaucomya_, _Anatina_, _Aspergillum_, and many others.\r\n\r\nThe number of species common to the Red Sea and Mediterranean is\r\nexceedingly small, some authorities even denying the existence of a\r\nsingle common species. The present author, from an examination of the\r\nshells dredged by MacAndrew at Suez, regarded 17 species as common, and\r\nMr. E. A. Smith has confirmed this view with regard to 8 of the species\r\nin question.[386] The Mollusca occurring in Post-pliocene beds at Suez\r\nshow that Mediterranean species lived there in comparatively recent\r\ngeological times.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the Suez Canal appears to have already induced several\r\nspecies to start on their travels from the Mediterranean to the Red Sea\r\nand _vice versâ_. Two Red Sea species (_Mactra olorina_ Phil., _Mytilus\r\nvariabilis_ Kr.) had in 1882 established themselves at Port Said, while\r\ntwo Mediterranean species (_Pholas dactylus_ L., _Solen vagina_ L.) had\r\nreached Ismailia.[387]\r\n\r\n(2) _The Japanese Sub-region_ consists of the Japanese Islands to\r\nNiphon, together with Corea and a stretch of adjacent mainland coast of\r\nunknown extent. The warm Kuro Siwo current, sweeping up between Luzon\r\nand Formosa, permits tropical species to extend much farther north than\r\non the opposite shores of America, where a cold polar current keeps\r\nthem back. A certain number of species, however, are common to the\r\ntwo shores of the Pacific, and a few circumpolar species occurring on\r\nour own coasts reach Japan, _e.g.__Trophon clathratus_, _Puncturella\r\nnoachina_, _Mya arenaria_, _Modiola modiolus_, _Lasaea rubra_, and\r\n_Nucula tenuis_.\r\n\r\nAmong the characteristic genera are _Fusus_, _Siphonalia_,\r\n_Columbarium_, _Hemifusus_, _Rapana_, _Chlorostoma_, _Pleurotomaria_,\r\n_Haliotis_, and _Cyclina_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      =C. The Australian Region=\r\n\r\nincludes the Australian coast-line from about Swan R.[388] (lat.\r\n32° S.) to Sandy Cape (lat. 25° S.), Tasmania, New Zealand, and the\r\nadjacent islands (except Lord Howe’s I.).\r\n\r\n(1) _The Australian Sub-region proper_ (which consists of the whole\r\nof the region excepting New Zealand and the adjacent islands) is\r\ndetermined by the influence of the Antarctic Drift, which washes the\r\nwhole of the southern coasts of Australia, and runs strongly northward\r\nbetween Australia and New Zealand. The E. Australian warm current from\r\nthe north is checked at Sandy Cape by this cold current, and flows off\r\nto New Zealand, the western shores of which island are consequently\r\nmuch warmer than the eastern. On the western coast of Australia the\r\nAntarctic Drift has less force, and tropical genera accordingly range\r\nsome 7 degrees farther south on the western than on the eastern coasts.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic genera are _Voluta_ (of which half the known\r\nspecies occur on Australian coasts[389]), _Cominella_, _Siphonalia_,\r\n_Struthiolaria_, _Risella_, _Phasianella_, a number of genera belonging\r\nto the Trochidae, _e.g._ _Liotia_, _Clanculus_, _Euchelus_, _Thalotia_,\r\n_Elenchus_, _Trochocochlea_, _Zizyphinus_, _Bankivia_, _Trigonia_,\r\n_Myodora_, _Myochama_, _Solenomya_, _Ephippodonta_, _Anapa_, _Mylitta_,\r\n_Mesodesma_, and _Chamostrea_. _Trigonia_, originally discovered as\r\na recent form in Sydney Harbour (p. 65), is not peculiar to that\r\nlocality, occurring also off Cape York, West Australia, and Tasmania.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Neozealanian Sub-region_ includes New Zealand, with the\r\noutlying islands (Chatham, Auckland, and Campbell Is.).\r\n\r\nAs many as 455 species (Cephalopoda, 8; Gasteropoda, 311; Scaphopoda,\r\n2; Pelecypoda, 134) have been enumerated by Professor F. W. Hutton as\r\noccurring within the sub-region, of which only 64 are found elsewhere,\r\nthe proportion of peculiar species being thus nearly 86 per cent. New\r\nZealand therefore is, in its marine, no less than its land Mollusca,\r\ngreatly isolated.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic genera are _Anthora_, _Cryptoconchus_, and\r\n_Vanganella_, which appear to be quite peculiar, _Trophon_,\r\n_Cominella_, _Euthria_, most of the Trochidae also characteristic of\r\nS. Australia, _Haliotis_, _Patella_, _Taria_, _Mesodesma_, _Mylitta_,\r\n_Zenatia_, _Standella_, and _Myodora_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =D. The American Region=\r\n\r\nincludes the entire coasts of North and South America with the adjacent\r\nislands, south of Cape Avinoff on the western, and south of Cape Cod\r\non the eastern coast, the portions north of these points belonging to\r\nthe Arctic Sub-region.\r\n\r\n(1) _The Aleutian Sub-region_ consists of the islands of Yesso and\r\nSaghalien, with the adjacent shores of the Sea of Okhotsk to Cape\r\nLopatka, the Aleutian Is., and the west American coast from about Cape\r\nAvinoff (lat. 60° N.) to St. Jean de Fuca Straits.\r\n\r\nA certain number of species, probably of arctic origin, are common\r\nwith British and also with East American shores, the former being the\r\nmore numerous. Species as familiar to us as _Lacuna divaricata_ Fabr.,\r\n_Trichotropis borealis_ Brod., _Pholas crispata_ L., _Mya truncata_ L.,\r\n_M. arenaria_ L., _Mytilus edulis_ L., and _Modiolaria nigra_ Gray,\r\noccur. The more characteristic genera are _Chrysodomus_, _Volutharpa_,\r\n_Buccinum_, _Tectura_, _Scurria_, _Chiton_, _Cryptochiton_ (_Cr.\r\nStelleri_ Midd. is by far the largest known of the Chitonidae, 6 inches\r\nlong), _Tellina_ and _Pecten_.\r\n\r\n(2) _The Californian Sub-region_ extends from St. Jean de Fuca Straits\r\n(lat. 48° N.) to Cape St. Lucas, the Gulf of California belonging to\r\nthe Panamic sub-region. The northern polar current, which washes the\r\nshores of this sub-region throughout their whole extent, prolongs the\r\nsouthward range of the more northern genera, and keeps back those more\r\nmarkedly tropical, the latter, however, creeping northward in the\r\nwarmer waters of the Gulf of California. Some authorities subdivide\r\nthis immense stretch of coast-line, as characterised by sub-temperate,\r\ntemperate, and sub-tropical genera, into the Oregonian, Californian,\r\nand Lower Californian provinces.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic genera are--in the north, _Argobuccinum_,\r\n_Zizyphinus_, _Chlorostoma_, _Tectura_, _Scurria_, _Chiton_\r\n(_Katharina_, _Mopalia_, _Tonicia_), _Cryptochiton_, _Placunanomia_,\r\nand _Mytilimeria_; in the centre, _Purpura_, _Monoceros_, _Amphissa_,\r\n_Norrisia_, _Platyodon_, _Tapes_, and _Macoma_; and, towards the south,\r\n_Olivella_, _Chorus_, _Macron_, _Pseudoliva_, _Trivia_, and _Haliotis_.\r\n\r\n(3) _The Panamic Sub-region_ extends from the head of the Gulf of\r\nCalifornia to Payta in Peru (lat. 5° S.). It is exceedingly rich in\r\nspecies, about 1500 having been described. The Mollusca are entirely\r\ndistinct from those of the Indo-Pacific Region, which, although\r\nextending from Natal to the Sandwich Islands, are unable to pass the\r\nenormous extent of sea which separates the nearest Polynesian island\r\nfrom the American coast.\r\n\r\nOn the two sides of the isthmus of Panama there occur certain pairs\r\nof species, which, while specifically distant, are evidently closely\r\nrelated to one another. Amongst these are, on the Panamic side,\r\n_Purpura speciosa_, _Cypraea cervinetta_, _Cassis abbreviata_, _Natica\r\nChemnitzii_, and _Strombus gracilior_, corresponding to _Purpura\r\ndeltoidea_, _Cypraea exanthema_, _Cassis inflata_, _Natica maroccana_,\r\nand _Strombus pugilis_, on the Caribbean. It is reasonable to conclude\r\nthat these “analogous species” are descendants of a stock which was\r\ncommon to both seas when the isthmus was open (probably not later than\r\nMiocene times), and which have, since the closing of the isthmus,\r\nbecome modified, some species considerably more than others.\r\n\r\nAmong the characteristic genera (compare p. 3) are _Conus_,\r\n_Pleurotoma_, _Terebra_, _Murex_, _Purpura_, _Oliva_, _Northia_,\r\n_Cantharus_, _Columbella_, _Anachis_, _Cypraea_, _Strombus_,\r\n_Cerithium_, _Coecum_, _Crepidula_, _Crucibulum_, _Vitrinella_;\r\n_Tellina_, _Semele_, _Tellidora_; and _Arca_.\r\n\r\n(4) _The Peruvian Sub-region_ extends from Payta in Peru to about the\r\nlatitude of Conception in S. Chili (37° S.), being checked from further\r\nextension southward by the cold Humboldt current, whose force is\r\ndistinctly felt as far north as Callao. This cold current thus produces\r\nthe same results as the similar current which impinges on S. Africa,\r\nbut has even more effect in decisively separating the fauna on the two\r\nsides of the great peninsula, scarcely a single species being common\r\nto the western and eastern coasts of S. America. The characteristics\r\nof the coast-lines themselves contribute to this result. The Chilian\r\ncoast is rocky, and descends abruptly to a great depth, while that of\r\nPatagonia and Argentina is sandy and very shallow to a great distance\r\nfrom land.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic genera are _Cancellaria_, _Columbella_, _Monoceros_,\r\n_Concholepas_, _Trochita_, _Fissurella_, _Chiton_; _Ceronia_,\r\n_Malletia_, and _Cumingia_. Some of the Californian genera, absent or\r\npoorly represented in the Panamic Sub-region, reappear in Chili, _e.g._\r\n_Scurria_, _Tectura_, and _Chlorostoma_.\r\n\r\n(5) _The Magellanic Sub-region_ includes the coast-line and adjacent\r\nislands (with the Falklands) from Conception in S. Chili to about Port\r\nMelo in Eastern Patagonia (lat. 45° S.).\r\n\r\nThe principal genera (many of which find a habitat on the gigantic\r\nMacrocystis which grows on every rock at low water) are _Euthria_,\r\n_Voluta_ (6 species, one, _V. magellanica_, the largest known)\r\n_Monoceros_, _Photinula_, _Patella_, _Chiton_; _Modiolarca_,\r\n_Malletia_, and _Mulinia_. Several genera characteristic of the Boreal\r\nand Arctic sub-regions recur, _e.g._ _Trophon_, _Admete_, _Margarita_,\r\n_Puncturella_, _Cyamium_, and _Astarte_.\r\n\r\n(6) _The Argentinian[390] Sub-region_ extends from about Cape Melo in\r\nPatagonia to the neighbourhood of S. Caterina I. in South Brazil (lat.\r\n28° S.). The sub-region stands in the same relation to the Magellanic,\r\non the east coast, as the Peruvian sub-region on the west, but, owing\r\nto the influence of the warm Brazil current, which overpowers the\r\ncolder water of the Falkland branch of the Cape Horn current, it\r\nreaches a point much farther south.\r\n\r\nThe Mollusca are not well known. The prevailing genera appear to\r\nbe _Oliva_, _Olivancillaria_, _Voluta_, _Bullia_, _Crepidula_;\r\n_Periploma_, and _Lyonsia_.\r\n\r\n(7) _The Caribbean Sub-region_ extends from S. Caterina I. in the south\r\nto Florida in the north, and includes the shores of the Gulf of Mexico\r\nand the whole of the West Indies. The influence of the warm Brazil\r\ncurrent (a branch of the South Equatorial) carries the range of the\r\npurely tropical species to a point much farther south than is reached\r\nby the tropical species on the west coast.\r\n\r\nThe sub-region is very rich in species, especially on the coral reefs\r\nof the Bahamas and N. Cuba, but the exceedingly small tide-fall makes\r\nshore collecting somewhat difficult beyond a certain point. The leading\r\ngenera are _Murex_, _Purpura_, _Melongena_, _Latirus_, _Marginella_,\r\n_Strombus_, _Triton_, _Cerithium_, _Littorina_, _Nerita_, _Scalaria_;\r\n_Tellina_, _Strigilla_, _Lucina_, and _Venus_. _Pleurotomaria_, a genus\r\nlong regarded as extinct, has been dredged alive off Tobago.\r\n\r\nAs compared with the tropical fauna of the Old World, that of the New\r\nWorld is poor in peculiar genera (compare p. 368). The relations of\r\nthis sub-region to the West African and the Panamic have been already\r\ndealt with (pp. 367 and 372).\r\n\r\n(8) _The Transatlantic Sub-region_ extends from Florida to Cape Cod\r\n(see p. 364). In the north the limits of the sub-region are distinctly\r\nmarked, in the south Caribbean species intermingle. Gould and Binney,\r\nin their _Invertebrata of Massachusetts_, enumerate 275 species\r\n(Cephalopoda, 6; Gasteropoda, 159; Scaphopoda, 2; Pelecypoda, 108), of\r\nwhich 59 (Gasteropoda, 37; Pelecypoda, 22) are British.\r\n\r\nAmong the characteristic genera are _Urosalpinx_, _Eupleura_, _Fulgur_,\r\n_Ptychatractus_, _Nassa_, _Crepidula_; _Solenomya_, _Mactra_,\r\n_Cypricia_, _Raëta_, _Astarte_, and _Yoldia_. Our common _Littorina\r\nlittorea_ appears to have been introduced into Nova Scotian waters in\r\nabout 1857, no previous trace of it occurring either in literature or\r\nshell-heaps. Since then it has spread rapidly into the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence, and also as far south as Newhaven, and is said to be driving\r\nout the indigenous _L. palliata_ from New England shores.[391] The debt\r\nhas been repaid by the introduction into British waters of the American\r\nclam (_Venus mercenaria_ L.), which, according to the _Manchester City\r\nNews_ of 23rd March 1889, was first observed in the Humber in 1864, and\r\nhas steadily increased up to the present time, when it bids fair to\r\ncompete, in those waters, with the familiar _Cardium edule_.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of Abyssal Mollusca.=--Large shells appear to be\r\nrare in the great ocean depths, and are usually very fragile; even\r\nmoderately-sized specimens are far from common. The only group in which\r\nspecies occur larger than the usual size is the Nudibranchs, which are\r\nrepresented by at least one form larger than an orange.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that abyssal molluscs are much less active and energetic\r\nthan their brethren on the shores. This view is favoured by the\r\nlooseness of their tissues, which seem ill adapted for prompt and\r\nvigorous action. The tenacious character of the mud on the ocean floor\r\nmust make rapid motion very difficult. The shell itself is usually\r\nfragile and delicate, the upper layers of arragonite being thin as\r\ncompared with shallow-water species, which makes the nacreous layer,\r\nwhen present, appear unusually conspicuous; in many cases the surface\r\nis characterised by a peculiar iridescence or sheen. The colour in\r\nthe shell of deep-sea Mollusca is never very pronounced, and is often\r\nabsent altogether. Light pink and salmon, pale yellow and brown, are\r\nnot uncommon. If the colour is in pattern, it is usually in the form\r\nof necklaces of spots, which sometimes coalesce into bands. With\r\nregard to sculpture, stout knobs and powerfully buttressed varices,\r\nsuch as occur in the tropical _Murex_ and _Purpura_, are not found in\r\ndeep-sea species. But the ornamentation is frequently elaborate, and\r\nthe sculpture rich and varied. There is an especial tendency towards\r\nstrings of bead-like knobs, revolving striae, and delicate transverse\r\nwaves, the sculpture being in many cases of a character which tends to\r\nstrengthen the structure of the shell, like the ridges in corrugated\r\niron.\r\n\r\nA remarkable feature in some deep-sea Mollusca is their singular\r\nresemblance, in shape, and particularly in the possession of a strong\r\ngreen periostracum, to some of our common fresh-water species.\r\nAccording to Dr. Dall, the cause of this phenomenon is the same in both\r\ncases. The fresh-water Mollusca secrete a strong periostracum, in order\r\nto protect the shell against the corrosive influence of the carbonic\r\nacid gas with which the water is surcharged. The shells of deep-sea\r\nMollusca, living, as they do, in water probably undisturbed by currents\r\nof any kind, have to protect themselves against the same eroding\r\ninfluence, and do so in the same way.[392]\r\n\r\nMollusca which live exclusively on algae and other forms of plant life\r\nare almost entirely wanting in the great depths, where vegetation is\r\nprobably unknown. The struggle for existence must be much less keen\r\nthan in the thickly populated shallows, where vicissitudes of every\r\nkind occur. The absence of rapid motion of water must obliterate many\r\nof those mechanical effects which tend to produce modifying influences\r\nupon the animals affected. In the absence of circumstances tending\r\nto cause variation, in the unbroken monotony of their surroundings,\r\nspecies must, one would think, preserve a marked uniformity over an\r\nexceedingly wide area of range.\r\n\r\nVegetable food being wanting, those genera which in shallower waters\r\nnever taste flesh, are compelled to become carnivorous. Characteristic\r\nof the great depths are very remarkable forms of Trochidae, in whose\r\nstomachs have been found the remains of Corallines and Foraminifera.\r\nAccording to Dr. Dall, the results of this diet show themselves in the\r\ngreatly increased space occupied by the intestine, in the diminution,\r\nas regards size, of the masticatory organs, the teeth and jaws, and\r\nalso in the prolongation of the anal end of the intestine into a free\r\ntube, which carries away the excreta in such a way that they do not\r\nfoul the water taken into the gills. The amount of nutriment contained\r\nin the bodies of dead Foraminifera is so small that a comparatively\r\nlarge quantity must be swallowed to keep the vital energies active,\r\nand therefore the amount evacuated must be proportionately larger\r\nalso. The abyssal Trochidae, then, and many other genera, sustain\r\nthemselves by feeding on the ‘rain’ of dead animal matter which falls\r\nupon the ocean floor, not so much hunting their prey as opening their\r\nmouths and eating whatever happens to fall into them. Genera which are\r\nnormally carnivorous would appear to do the same. The Pleurotomidae,\r\nfor instance, are a family markedly characteristic of very deep water.\r\nRepresentatives of the genus which occur in shallower water are known\r\nto secure their prey while in the living state. But, according to\r\nDr. Dall, a singularly small proportion of deep-sea Mollusca, as\r\ncompared with those from the littoral region, show signs of having\r\nbeen drilled or attacked by other Mollusca. This could hardly be the\r\ncase if the Pleurotomidae retained their predatory habits, since they\r\nare more numerous in the great depths than any six other families\r\ntaken together. It has already been mentioned (p. 186) that a large\r\nproportion of deep-sea Mollusca are perfectly blind.\r\n\r\nAmongst other remarkable forms from the great depths may be mentioned\r\n_Pleurotomaria_, with its singular anal slit (Fig. 269, p. 407)\r\nextending in some cases half way round the last whorl. Three or four\r\nspecies of this genus, so characteristic of almost all fossiliferous\r\nstrata down to the Cambrian, have been obtained in very limited\r\nnumbers off the West Indies and Japan. Dentaliidae, especially the\r\nsub-genus _Cadulus_, find a congenial home in the slimy ocean mud.\r\nOne of the greatest molluscan treasures procured by the _Challenger_\r\nwas _Guivillea alabastrina_ Wats., a magnificent Volute as white as\r\nalabaster, 6½ inches long, which was dredged from 1600 fath. in the\r\nSouth Atlantic, between Marion Island and the Crozets. Another very\r\ncurious form, belonging to the same family, is _Provocator pulcher_\r\nWats., a shell about half the size of _Guivillea_, of stouter\r\nproportions, and with an angulated and patulous mouth. This shell was\r\ndredged by the _Challenger_ in comparatively shallow water (105–150\r\nfath.) off Kerguelen Island. Among the Trochidae are the fine new\r\ngenera _Basilissa_, _Bembix_, and _Gaza_. The exploring voyages of\r\nthe American surveying steamer _Blake_, in the Gulf of Mexico and the\r\nCaribbean Sea, have given us the remarkable new forms _Benthobia_\r\n(possibly akin to _Admete_), _Mesorhytis_ (a sub-genus of _Fasciolaria_\r\nhitherto only known from the Cretaceous of North America), and\r\n_Benthodolium_ (possibly = _Oocorys_), a genus akin to _Cassis_.\r\n\r\nIn his report on the Pelecypoda obtained by the _Challenger_, Mr. E.\r\nA. Smith remarks that as a rule “very deep-water ‘benthal’ species\r\ncertainly have a tendency to be without colour and of thin structure,\r\nfacts no doubt resulting from the absence of light, the difficulty of\r\nsecreting lime, the scarcity of food, and other unfavourable conditions\r\nof existence.” At the same time, he notices that most of the species\r\nobtained belong to genera which, even when occurring in shallow water,\r\nare thin and colourless, _e.g._ _Neaera_, _Lima_, _Cryptodon_, _Abra_,\r\n_Verticordia_, etc. Deep-water species of such genera as have a decided\r\nperiostracum (_Malletia_, _Limopsis_, _Leda_, _Nucula_, _Arca_) retain\r\nit with little if any modification. The deep-water Pelecypoda of the\r\nAtlantic and Pacific Oceans present no special features of interest.\r\nThe species are few in number, and the genera are not remarkable either\r\nfor novelty or peculiarity of form.\r\n\r\nThe greatest depth at which Pelecypoda have been obtained is 2900 fath.\r\nmid North Pacific (_Callocardia pacifica_ Sm., _Abra profundorum_\r\nSm.); the greatest depth at which Gasteropoda have been obtained is\r\n2650 fath. South Atlantic (_Stylifer brychius_ Wats.), both by the\r\n_Challenger_. The deepest _Challenger_ Nudibranch came from 2425 fath.,\r\nand the deepest _Chiton_ from 2300 fath. The greatest depth ever\r\ndredged is 4575 fath. off the east coast of Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                           CLASS CEPHALOPODA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cephalopoda present a complete contrast to the majority of the\r\nMollusca in habits and in many points of organisation. In their power\r\nof rapid movement and their means of progression, their extreme\r\nferocity and carnivorous habits, their loss, in so many cases, of a\r\nshell, and in its constitution when present, in the general symmetry of\r\ntheir parts, in their reproductive and nervous system, they stand in\r\na position of extreme isolation with nothing to connect them with the\r\nrest of the phylum.\r\n\r\nProfessor A. E. Verrill has collected many interesting details with\r\nregard to gigantic Cephalopoda occurring on the north-eastern coasts\r\nof America. From these it appears that the tentacular arms of some\r\nspecies of _Architeuthis_ measure as much as 32, 33, 35, and 42 feet in\r\nlength, while the total length, including the body, sometimes exceeds\r\n50 feet. Even off the Irish coast a specimen was once captured whose\r\ntentacular arms were 30 feet long, the mandibles 4 inches across, and\r\nthe eyes about 15 inches in diameter.[393] The strength of these giant\r\nCephalopods, aided as they are by formidable rows of suckers and other\r\nmeans of securing a grip, is almost incredible. Cases are not uncommon,\r\nin which persons diving or bathing have been attacked, and have with\r\ndifficulty made their escape.\r\n\r\nGreat damage is frequently inflicted by Cephalopoda upon shoals of fish\r\non British coasts. Off Lybster (Caithness) _Loligo_ and _Ommastrephes_\r\ndevour the herring, large numbers of which are cut up and bitten on\r\nthe back of the neck by these creatures. On the American coasts the\r\nmackerel fisheries are sometimes entirely spoiled by the immense\r\nschools of squid which infest the Bay of St. Lawrence.[394] When\r\nexcited in the pursuit of fish Cephalopoda leap high out of the sea.\r\nDr. W. H. Rush[395] relates that when about 300 miles off the coast of\r\nBrazil, a swarm of hundreds of decapods flew from the water and landed\r\non the deck of the ship, which was 12 feet above the surface level, and\r\nthey had to go over the hammock nettings to reach it.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 238.--_Octopus vulgaris_ Lam., Naples: =A=,\r\n  At rest; =B=, in motion; _f_, funnel, the arrow showing the\r\n  direction of the propelling current of water. (After Merculiano.)]\r\n\r\nThe common _Octopus vulgaris_ Lam., of British and south European\r\ncoasts, inhabits some rocky hole, the approaches to which, like the\r\nden of a fabled giant, are strewn with the bones of his victims. Homer\r\nhimself knew how hard it is to drag the polypus out of his hole,\r\nand how the stones cling fast to his suckers. The colour-changes,\r\nwhich flit across the skin of the _Octopus_, appear, to some extent,\r\nexpressive of the different emotions of the animal. They are also\r\nundoubtedly protective, enabling it to assimilate itself in colour to\r\nits environment. Mr. J. Hornell[396] has noticed an _Octopus_, while\r\ncrawling over the rock-work in his tank, suddenly change the colour of\r\nthe whole right or left side of its body, and of the four arms on the\r\nsame side, to a snowy whiteness. They have also been seen to change\r\ncolour, as if involuntarily, according to the material on which they\r\ncrawl. The nerve-centres which control the chromatophores or pigment\r\ncells, causing them to expand or contract, are found to connect with\r\nthe optic ganglia; hence the changes of colour may be regarded as a\r\nreflex result of the creature’s visual perception of its surroundings.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Order Dibranchiata.=\r\n\r\nCephalopoda with two symmetrical branchiae, funnel completely tubular,\r\nmouth surrounded by 8 or 10 arms furnished with suckers or hooks,\r\nink-sac and fins usually present, eyes with a lens; shell internal or\r\nabsent.\r\n\r\nThe Dibranchiata are not known from Palaeozoic strata, and first\r\nappear (_Belemnites_, _Belemnoteuthis_) in the Trias. Whether they\r\nare to be regarded as derived from some form of Tetrabranchiata,\r\n_e.g._ _Orthoceras_, or as possessing an independent origin from some\r\ncommon stock, cannot at present be decided. They attain their highest\r\ndevelopment at the present time. The earliest representatives of the\r\nOrder (the _Phragmophora_) possessed a shell chambered like that of the\r\nTetrabranchiata. These chambered Dibranchiates rapidly reached their\r\nmaximum in the upper Lias and as rapidly declined, until at the close\r\nof the Cretaceous epoch they were comparatively scarce, only a few\r\ngenera (_Beloptera_, _Spirulirostra_) surviving into Tertiary times.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary Dibranchiate Cephalopod may be regarded as consisting of\r\ntwo parts--(_a_) the head, in which are situated the organs of sense,\r\nand to which are appended the prehensile organs and the principal\r\norgans of locomotion; (_b_) a trunk or visceral sac, enclosed in\r\na muscular mantle and containing the respiratory, generative, and\r\ndigestive organs. The visceral sac is often strengthened, and the\r\nviscera protected, by an internal non-spiral shell. The ‘arms’ which\r\nsurround the mouth are modifications of the molluscan foot (p. 200),\r\nand are either eight or ten in number. In the former case (Octopoda)\r\nthe arms, which are termed ‘sessile,’ are all of similar formation, in\r\nthe latter (Decapoda), besides the eight sessile arms there are two\r\nmuch longer ‘tentacular’ arms, which widen at their tips into ‘clubs’\r\ncovered with suckers.\r\n\r\nRemarks have already been made on the generative organs of Cephalopoda\r\n(p. 136 f.), the branchiae (p. 170), the nervous system (p. 206), the\r\neye (p. 182), the radula (p. 236), and the ink-sac (p. 241).\r\n\r\nOne of the most characteristic features of the Dibranchiata are the\r\n_acetabula_, or suckers, with which the arms are furnished. They\r\nare usually disposed on the sessile arms in rows (of which there\r\nare four in most _Sepia_, two in _Octopus_, and one in _Eledone_),\r\nand become more numerous and smaller at the tip of the arm. They\r\nare massed together in large numbers of unequal size on the ‘clubs’\r\nin the Decapoda, particularly in _Loligo_. In most Octopoda their\r\nbase is flush with the surface of the arm, but in Decapoda the\r\nacetabula are pedunculate, or raised on short stalks. In Octopoda\r\nagain, the acetabula are fleshy throughout, but in the Decapoda they\r\nare strengthened by a corneous rim with a smooth or denticulate\r\nedge (_Ommastrephes_, _Architeuthis_). Many of the acetabula on the\r\ntentacular and sometimes on the sessile arms of the Onychoteuthidae\r\nenclose a powerful hook, which is retractile like the claws of a cat.\r\n\r\nIn mechanical structure the acetabula consist of a disc with a slightly\r\nswollen margin, from which a series of muscular folds converge\r\ntowards the centre of the disc, where a round aperture leads to a\r\ngradually widening cavity. Within this cavity is a sort of button, the\r\n_caruncle_, which can be elevated or depressed like the piston of a\r\nsyringe; thus when the sucker is applied the piston is withdrawn and a\r\nvacuum created (Owen).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 239.--‘Club’ of _Loligo vulgaris_ L., showing\r\n  the crowded pedunculate acetabula, × ½.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 240.--One of the suckers of _Architeuthis\r\n  dux_ Stp., showing the denticulate margin and corneous ring; _p_,\r\n  peduncle.]\r\n\r\nIn many Octopoda the arms are connected by a web (the _umbrella_),\r\nwhich sometimes extends up the greater part of the arms\r\n(_Cirrhoteuthis_, some _Eledone_), at others occurs only at the\r\nbase. The use of the umbrella is perhaps to assist in locomotion, by\r\nalternate contraction and expansion.\r\n\r\nA cartilaginous skeleton is well developed, especially in the Decapoda.\r\nIn _Sepia_ a cephalic cartilage forms a complete ring round the\r\noesophagus, the eyes being situated in lateral prolongations of\r\nthe same. In front of the cephalic cartilage occurs a piece like an\r\ninverted T, which supports the base of the anterior arms. The\r\nDecapoda have also a ‘nuchal’ cartilage, connecting the head with the\r\nanterior dorsal portion of the mantle, while cartilaginous knobs on the\r\nventral mantle button into corresponding sockets on the funnel.\r\n\r\n=Sub-order I.=--_Octopoda._--Body round or bag-like, generally without\r\nfins, arms eight, suckers fleshy, usually sessile, oviducts paired, no\r\nnidamental glands, shell absent.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 241.--_Cirrhoteuthis magna_ Hoyle, S.\r\n  Atlantic.

Pliocene----.\r\n\r\nThe shell consists of three layers, the two external being prismatic,\r\nthe middle fibrous. Its secretion by the arms and not by the mantle\r\nedge is unique, and shows that it is not homologous with the ordinary\r\nmolluscan shell.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 243.--_Argonauta argo_ L., the position\r\n  assumed by a specimen kept in captivity, the arrow showing\r\n  the direction of movement: _f_, funnel; _m_, mouth, with jaws\r\n  projecting; _sh_, shell, with arms as seen through it; _wa_,\r\n  webbed arm clasping shell. (After Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nThe great controversy on the _Argonauta_, which once raged with so\r\nmuch fierceness, is now matter of ancient history. It seems scarcely\r\ncredible that between fifty and sixty years ago, two of the leading\r\nzoologists of the day, Mr. Gray and M. de Blainville maintained that\r\nthe animal which inhabits the Argonaut shell is a parasite, without any\r\nmeans of depositing or forming a shell of its own, but which possesses\r\nitself of the Argonaut shell, either by expelling or succeeding the\r\noriginal inhabitant, a supposed nucleo-branchiate (Heteropod) mollusc\r\nakin to _Carinaria_. The final blow to this strange hypothesis--which\r\nwas urged by the most ingenious series of arguments--was given by\r\nProfessor Owen, who in 1839 brought before the Zoological Society\r\nof London the admirable observations of Madame Jeannette Power, who\r\nmade a continuous study of a number of specimens of _Argonauta_ in\r\nher vivarium at Messina. The result of these observations tended to\r\nshow that the young _Argonauta_ when first excluded from the egg is\r\nnaked, but that in ten or twelve days the shell begins to form, that\r\nthe principal agents in the deposition of shell are the two velated\r\nor web-like arms; and that portions of the shell, if broken away, are\r\nrepaired by a deposition of calcareous matter.[397]\r\n\r\nFAM. 4. _Philonexidae._--Mantle supported by two ridges placed on\r\nthe funnel; large ‘aquiferous’ pores (supposed to introduce water\r\ninto the tissues) near the head or funnel; suckers in two rows,\r\npedunculate.--Atlantic and Mediterranean.\r\n\r\nGenera: _Ocythoe_, arms of unequal size, no intervening membrane, third\r\narm on the right hectocotylised (see Fig. 51, p. 138), two aquiferous\r\npores at the base of the siphon; male very small; _Tremoctopus_, two\r\naquiferous pores between the eyes, two on the ventral side of the head.\r\n\r\nFAM. 5. _Alloposidae._--Mantle edge united to the head by three\r\ncommissures; arms extensively webbed, acetabula sessile.

The third right arm (Fig. 52, p.\r\n140) is hectocotylised, the modified extremity being, according to\r\nHoyle, sometimes minute, sometimes spoon-shaped, with a tendency to\r\ntransverse ridges, rarely slender and very long. The relative length\r\nof the pairs of arms varies in different species. Two cartilaginous\r\nstylets, imbedded in the dorsal mantle, are said by Owen to represent\r\nthe shell.\r\n\r\nOther genera; _Pinnoctopus_, body furnished with broad lateral wings\r\nwhich meet at the posterior end; _Cistopus_, a large web prolonged\r\nalong the sides of the arms, fitted with oval aquiferous pouches, with\r\npores at their base, between each pair of arms; _Eledone_ (Fig. 244),\r\none row of acetabula; _Tritaxeopus_, _Iapetella_.\r\n\r\n=Sub-order II.=--_Decapoda._--Body oblong, mouth surrounded by\r\nfour pairs of sessile and one pair of tentacular arms, the latter\r\nterminated by a ‘club’; acetabula pedunculate and furnished with a\r\ncorneous margin; mantle margin locked to the base of the funnel by a\r\ncartilaginous apparatus; head and anterior part of body furnished with\r\naquiferous pores; fins present; mandibles corneous; oviduct single,\r\nlarge nidamental glands in the female; shell internal.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 244.--_Eledone Aldrovandi_ Delle Chiaje,\r\n  Naples, from ventral side, × ½.]\r\n\r\nThe tentacular arms, which are the principal external feature of the\r\nDecapoda, are not derived from the same muscular ring as the sessile\r\narms, but arise from the cephalic cartilage, and emerge between the\r\nthird and fourth arm on each side. In _Sepia_ they can be entirely\r\nretracted into a kind of pocket behind the eyes, while in _Loligo_ they\r\nare simply folded over one another. In _Chiroteuthis_ the arms are six\r\ntimes as long as the body, and the clubs have four rows of denticulate\r\nsuckers.\r\n\r\nThe anterior ventral[398] portion of the mantle is furnished with a\r\nsingular contrivance for locking it to the funnel, and so rendering the\r\nwhole animal more capable of resisting the impact of any force. This\r\ncontrivance generally consists of a series of ridges or buttons which\r\nfit into grooves or button-holes, the ridges being on the interior face\r\nof the mantle and the corresponding grooves on the funnel, or _vice\r\nversâ_. The ‘resisting apparatus’ is most elaborate in the pelagic\r\ngenera, and least so in the more sluggish littoral forms. A similar,\r\nbut not so complex, arrangement occurs also in the Octopoda.\r\n\r\nThe different forms of the shell appear to indicate successive stages\r\nin a regular course of development. We have in _Spirula_ (Fig. 247)\r\na chambered shell of the Tetrabranchiate type, but of considerably\r\ndiminished size, which has ceased to contain the animal in its last\r\nchamber, and has become almost entirely enveloped in reflected folds\r\nof the mantle. These folds gradually concresce to form a definite\r\nshell-sac, by the walls of which are secreted additional laminae of\r\ncalcareous shell-substance. These laminae invest the original shell,\r\nwhich gradually (_Spirulirostra_, _Belosepia_) loses the spiral form\r\nand becomes straight, eventually disappearing, while the calcareous\r\nlaminae alone remain (_Sepia_). These in their turn disappear, leaving\r\nonly the plate or ‘pen’ upon which they were deposited (_Loligo_),\r\nwhich itself also, with the shell-sac, finally disappears, surviving\r\nonly in the early stages of _Octopus_ (Lankester).\r\n\r\nThe Decapoda are divided, according to the character of the shell, into\r\n_Phragmophora_, _Sepiophora_, and _Chondrophora_.[399]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 245.--‘Club’ of _Onychoteuthis_ sp., showing\r\n  the hooks and clusters of fixing cushions and acetabula below\r\n  them, × ½.]\r\n\r\nA. PHRAGMOPHORA.--Arms furnished with hooks or acetabula; shell\r\nconsisting of a _phragmocone_ or chambered sac enclosed in a thin wall\r\n(the _conotheca_), septa pierced by a siphuncle near the ventral margin\r\n(in _Spirula_ alone this chambered sac forms the whole of the shell).\r\nThe apex of the cone lies towards the posterior end of the body, and\r\nis usually enveloped in a calcareous _guard_ or _rostrum_. Beyond the\r\nanterior end of the rostrum the conotheca is extended forward dorsally\r\nby a _pro-ostracum_ or anterior shell, which may be shelly or horny,\r\nand corresponds to the _gladius_ of the Chondrophora. The rostrum\r\nconsists of calcareous fibres arranged perpendicularly to the planes\r\nof the laminae of growth, and radiating from an axis, the so-called\r\n_apical line_, which extends from the extremity of the phragmocone to\r\nthat of the rostrum. _Distribution_, see p. 380.\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. _Spirulidae._--Arms with acetabula, shell a loose spiral,\r\nwithout rostrum or pro-ostracum, partially external, enclosed in two\r\nlobes of the mantle (Figs. 247 and 248).\r\n\r\nThe single species of the single genus (_S. Peronii_ Lam. = _laevis_\r\nGray) has not yet been thoroughly investigated, although the shell\r\noccurs in thousands on many tropical beaches, and is sometimes drifted\r\non our own shores. The animal appears to have the power of adhesion\r\nto the rocks by means of a terminal sucker or pore. The protoconch\r\nis present, and contains a prosiphon, which does not connect with\r\nthe siphuncle. The septal necks are continuous, not broken as in\r\n_Nautilus_. The siphuncle is on the ventral margin of the shell, the\r\nlast whorl of which projects slightly on the dorsal and ventral sides,\r\nbut is even there covered by a thin fold of the mantle. The retractor\r\nmuscles of the funnel and of the head find their _point d’appui_ on the\r\nshell, the last chamber of which contains the posterior part of the\r\nliver, with which the membranous siphuncle is connected.\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. _Belemnitidae._--Arms hooked as in _Onychoteuthis_, fins large;\r\nphragmocone straight, initial chamber globular, larger than the second,\r\nrostrum often very long, investing the phragmocone, pro-ostracum\r\nsword- or leaf-shaped, rounded in front, seldom preserved, ink-sac\r\npresent.--Lower Lias to Cretaceous.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 246.--_Sepia officinalis_ L., with mantle cut\r\n  away to show position of internal shell, × ½. (The ends of the\r\n  tentacular arms are cut off.)]\r\n\r\nThe Belemnitidae are believed to have been gregarious, and to have\r\nlived in shallow water on a muddy bottom. Specimens are sometimes found\r\nin which even the ink-sac can be recognised _in situ_. The relative\r\nproportions of rostrum and phragmocone vary greatly in different\r\ngroups, the rostrum being in some cases two feet long, in others only\r\njust enclosing the phragmocone. As a rule the rostrum is the only\r\nportion which has been preserved.\r\n\r\nFAM. 3. _Belosepiidae._--Phragmocone short, slightly curved, chambers\r\nsmall, placed at the posterior end of a sepion, rostrum solid,\r\nobtuse.--Eocene (Paris, Bracklesham, etc.).\r\n\r\n_Fam. 4._ _Belopteridae._--Sepion not known; phragmocone curved,\r\nsiphuncle on the ventral margin, rostrum well developed, pointed.\r\nPrincipal genus, _Spirulirostra_.--Miocene of Turin.\r\n\r\nThese two families, with their small, curved phragmocone and (in the\r\ncase of the Belosepiidae) large sepion, are clearly intermediate\r\nbetween the Phragmophora and Sepiophora. Some authorities place them\r\nwith the latter group.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 247.--Shell of _Spirula Peronii_ Lam.\r\n  =A=, Cutside view; =B=, showing last chamber and position of\r\n  siphuncle; =C=, in section, showing the septa and course of\r\n  siphuncle; =D=, shell broken to show the convexity of the inner\r\n  side of the septa; =E=, portion of a septal neck.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 248.--_Spirula Peronii_ Lam.: _d_, terminal\r\n  sucker; _f_, funnel; _s_{1}_, _s_{2}_, projecting portions of\r\n  shell, the internal part of which is dotted in.

In _Onychia_, _Onychoteuthis_\r\nand _Ancistroteuthis_, the sessile arms have acetabula only, in\r\n_Gonatus_ and _Abralia_ they have hooks as well, while in _Verania_,\r\n_Ancistrochirus_ and _Enoploteuthis_, the sessile arms have hooks only.\r\nThe number of rows of hooks or acetabula varies with the different\r\ngenera.\r\n\r\nFAM. 7. _Chiroteuthidae._--Head nearly as large as the body; fins\r\nterminal, tentacular arms very long, sessile arms slightly webbed,\r\nacetabula denticulated; mantle-supports consisting of cartilaginous\r\nridges on the mantle, which fit into corresponding depressions on the\r\nfunnel, gladius expanded at each end.--Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nThe six dorsal arms in _Histioteuthis_ are united by a broad web,\r\nwhile in _Histiopsis_ the web only reaches half way up the arm. In\r\n_Chiroteuthis_ the tentacular arms have scattered sessile suckers\r\nthroughout their whole length, and four rows of very long pedunculate\r\nsuckers on the clubs.\r\n\r\nFAM. 8. _Cranchiidae._--Head small, body rounded, barrel-shaped, fins\r\nterminal, eyes often very large, sessile arms short, tentacular arms\r\nlong, thread-like.--World-wide.\r\n\r\n_Cranchia_ proper has the tentacular clubs finned, with eight rows of\r\nsuckers, body sometimes covered with warty tubercles. _Loligopsis_ has\r\na very attenuated body, with fins terminally united; some species are\r\nspotted with colour, or have rows of tubercles on the ventral side.\r\n_Taonius_ (Fig. 251) is doubtfully distinct from _Loligopsis_.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 251.--_Taonius hyperboreus_ Stp., N.\r\n  Atlantic: _e_, _e_, eyes; _f_, _f_, fins; _t_, _t_, tentacular\r\n  arms.

In most of the Nautiloidea they are\r\nregularly curved, as in _Nautilus_, or straight, as in _Orthoceras_,\r\nbut in the Ammonoidea they are often exceedingly complex. The edge of\r\nthe septum, where it unites with the shell-wall, is called the suture,\r\nand the sutural line, which is not seen until the porcellanous layer is\r\nremoved, varies in shape with the septum.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 252.--_Nautilus pompilius_ L., in section,\r\n  showing the septa (_s_, _s_), the septal necks (_s.n_, _s.n_),\r\n  the siphuncle dotted in (_si_), and the large body chamber\r\n  (_ch_).]\r\n\r\nThe septa are traversed by a membranous tube known as the _siphuncle_,\r\nwhich in _Nautilus_ is said by Owen to connect ultimately with the\r\npericardium. The _septal necks_, or short tubular prolongations of the\r\nsepta where they are perforated by the siphuncle, are in the great\r\nmajority of the Nautiloidea directed backwards (Fig. 252), _i.e._,\r\nthey project from the front wall of each chamber, while in nearly all\r\nAmmonoidea they are directed forwards. When the siphuncle is narrow,\r\nas in the Ammonoidea, it is simple, but when wide, as in many of the\r\nNautiloidea, its walls are often thickened by the deposition of\r\nmasses of calcareous matter, or by rings and radiating lamellae of\r\nthe same material. In position, the siphuncle is sometimes central,\r\nsometimes sub-central, sometimes (Ammonoidea) marginal. In some cases\r\nits position is believed to change during the growth of the individual.\r\nThe precise object served by the siphuncle is at present unknown. Some\r\nhold that it preserves the vitality of the unoccupied chambers, by\r\nconnecting them with the soft parts of the animal; others have regarded\r\nit as a means for lightening the shell by the passage of some gas into\r\nthe chambers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 253.--_Ammonites_ (_Cadoceras_) _sublaevis_\r\n  Sowb., Kellaway’s Rock, showing the marginal position of the\r\n  siphuncle (_si_).]\r\n\r\nThe initial chamber in Nautiloidea consists of an obtuse incurved cone,\r\nmarked on the outer surface of its posterior wall by a small scar known\r\nas the _cicatrix_, which may be slit-like, round, oval, or cruciform\r\nin shape. It has been held that the cicatrix originally communicated\r\nwith the protoconch or larval shell, which probably dropped off as\r\ndevelopment proceeded. In the Ammonoidea, on the other hand, there\r\nis no cicatrix, and the initial chamber probably represents the\r\nprotoconch, as seen in the nucleus of many Gasteropoda.\r\n\r\n=Sub-order 1.= _Nautiloidea._--Shell straight, bent, or coiled,\r\naperture simple or contracted; siphuncle often narrowed by internal\r\ndeposits, position variable; septal necks short, usually directed\r\nbackwards; septa concave towards the aperture; initial chamber conical,\r\nwith a cicatrix on the posterior wall.\r\n\r\nThe Nautiloidea, of which _Nautilus_ is the sole living representative,\r\ndate back to the Cambrian epoch, and attain their maximum in the\r\nSilurian and Devonian. At the close of the Palaeozoic era, every\r\nfamily, with the sole exceptions of the _Orthoceratidae_ and\r\n_Nautilidae_, appears to have become extinct. The former disappear with\r\nthe Trias, and after the lapse of the whole Secondary era, _Aturia_, a\r\nform closely related to _Nautilus_, makes its appearance.\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Retrosiphonata_: septal necks directed _backwards_.\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. _Orthoceratidae._[401]--Shell straight or slightly curved,\r\naperture simple, body-chamber large; siphuncle cylindrical, position\r\nvariable.

When the animal swims, the tentacles are\r\nextended radially from the head, somewhat like those of a sea-anemone.\r\nThe direction of the many pairs of tentacles at constant but different\r\nangles from the head, is the most striking feature in the living\r\n_Nautilus_, and accounts for its being described, when seen on the\r\nsurface, as ‘a shell with something like a cauliflower sticking out\r\nof it.’[402] The funnel is not a complete tube, but is formed by the\r\noverlapping of the margins of two thin fleshy lobes (which are probably\r\nmorphologically epipodia), so that when the two lobes are parted, a\r\nbroad canal appears, leading to the branchial cavity. The head is\r\nconical, and the mouth and its appendages can be retracted into a sort\r\nof sheath, over which fits the ‘hood.’\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 255.--=A=, _Gomphoceras ellipticum_ M’Coy,\r\n  Silurian: =B=, aperture (_ap_) of same; _s_, _s_, septa; _si_,\r\n  position of siphuncle.

Others again regard the Ammonoidea as a third, and\r\ndistinct Order of Cephalopoda. Their distribution extends from the\r\nSilurian to (possibly) the early Tertiary. No trace has ever been\r\nfound of an ink-sac, mandible, or hooks on the arms; the shell was\r\nundoubtedly external.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 256.--Diagram of the sutures of Ammonites:\r\n  =A=, an elaborate suture (_Phylloceras_); =B=, a simple suture\r\n  (_Ceratites_); _s.s_, siphonal, _s.v_, ventral, _s.l_, first\r\n  lateral, _s.l´_, second lateral saddles; _s.a_, _s.a_, auxiliary\r\n  saddles; _l.v_, ventral, _l_, first lateral, _l´_, second lateral\r\n  lobe; _l.a_, _l.a_, auxiliary lobes. The arrow points _towards_\r\n  the aperture. (From Woodward.) Compare Fig. 258.]\r\n\r\nThe sutural line, which indicates the septa, and is generally\r\nconcealed beneath the outer layer of shell, consists of a number of\r\n_lobes_ or depressions, the concave part of which is directed towards\r\nthe aperture. Between these lobes lie corresponding elevations, or\r\n_saddles_, the convex part of which is directed towards the aperture.\r\nThere are six principal lobes (Fig. 256): the _siphonal_ or _ventral_,\r\nwhich is traversed by the siphuncle, the _dorsal_, and a superior and\r\ninferior lateral on each side; smaller auxiliary lobes may succeed\r\nthese latter. The adjacent saddles have received corresponding\r\nnames. As a rule the sutural line is very complex, but in some cases\r\n(_Goniatites_, _Lobites_) it is simple (Fig. 258, A). The first saddle\r\nof a large number of genera serves as a means of classification,\r\naccording as it is broad or narrow. Some authorities reverse the terms\r\nventral and dorsal, as applied above. It is probable, however, that\r\nthe position of the animal of _Ammonites_ in its shell resembled that\r\nof _Nautilus_. The siphuncle is dorsal (internal) in _Clymenia_ only,\r\nventral (external) in all other genera.\r\n\r\nThe _aptychus_ of Ammonoidea is a corneous or calcareous valve-like\r\nbody, generally formed of two symmetrical parts (Fig. 257). It has been\r\nregarded by some as the covering of the nidamental gland, and hence as\r\noccurring only in the female, by others, with more probability, as an\r\noperculum, covering or imbedded in a hood formed, as in _Nautilus_,\r\nof modified arms.

Silurian ----.\r\n\r\nThe Chitons are found in all parts of the world, ranging in size from\r\na length of about half an inch to six inches or more in the giant\r\n_Cryptochiton_. Although in the main sub-littoral, they occur at very\r\ngreat depths; the _Challenger_ dredged _Leptochiton benthus_ Hadd. at\r\n2300 fathoms. _Chiton Polii_ exceptionally occurs at Malta--_teste_\r\nMacAndrew--above sea margin, but within reach of the ripple. As a\r\nrule, the Chitons live in concealment, on the under surface of stones\r\nor in deep and narrow fissures in the rocks. When the stone to which\r\nthey are attached is turned over, they crawl slowly to the side which\r\nis not exposed, as if disliking the light. An undescribed species,\r\nhowever, which I took at Panama, crawled quite as fast as an ordinary\r\nsnail. _Chiton fulvus_ Wood, apparently is accustomed to crawl with\r\nsome rapidity. MacAndrew took it in abundance on his anchor chain in\r\nVigo Bay every time his yacht was got under weigh. He also found it\r\ncrawling in sand on the shore, to which habit is no doubt due its\r\nextreme cleanness and freedom from the foreign growths which are\r\nso characteristic of many of the species. When detached a _Chiton_\r\ncontracts the muscles of the whole body, and rolls up into a ball like\r\na wood-louse.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 261.--Valves of a _Chiton_ separated to\r\n  show the various parts (anterior valve uppermost): _a_, _a_,\r\n  articulamentum; _b_, beak; _j_, jugum; _pl_, _pl_, pleura; _t_,\r\n  _t_, tegmentum.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 262.--Valves of _Chitonellus_ separated out\r\n  (anterior valve uppermost): _a_, _a_, articulamentum; _t_, _t_,\r\n  tegmentum. × 2.]\r\n\r\nThe _Polyplacophora_ are characterised, _externally_, by their usually\r\narticulated shell of eight _plates_ or _valves_, which is surrounded\r\nand partly kept in position by a muscular _girdle_. These plates\r\noverlap like tiles on a roof in such a way that the posterior edge of\r\nthe first, cephalic, or anterior valve projects over the anterior edge\r\nof the succeeding valve, which in its turn overlaps the next, and so on\r\nthroughout. Seven-valved monstrosities very rarely occur.\r\n\r\nA certain portion of each valve is covered either by the girdle or\r\nby the valve next anterior to it. This portion, which is whitish in\r\ncolour and non-porous in structure, forms part of an inner layer which\r\nunderlies the rest of the substance of the valve, and is called the\r\n_articulamentum_. The external portion of the valves, or _tegmentum_,\r\nis generally more or less sculptured, and is largely composed of\r\nchitin, impregnated with salts of lime, thus answering more to a\r\ncuticle than to a shell proper. It is very porous, being pierced by\r\na quantity of minute holes of two sizes, known as _megalopores_ and\r\n_micropores_, which are connected together by minute canals containing\r\nwhat is probably fibrous or nerve tissue, the mouths of the pores being\r\noccupied by sense organs connected with these nerves. The tegmentum of\r\nthe six intermediate valves is generally divided into three triangular\r\nareas by two more or less prominent ribs, which diverge from the\r\nneighbourhood of the median _beak_ or _umbo_. The space enclosed\r\nbetween these ribs is known as the _median area_ or _jugum_, the other\r\ntwo spaces as the _lateral areas_ or _pleura_. The ribs terminate with\r\nthe edge of the tegmentum, and are not found on the articulamentum.\r\nIn certain genera these areas are either non-existent, or are not\r\ndistinctly marked. The sculpture of the lateral areas (which is, as\r\na rule, much stronger than that of the median area) will generally\r\nbe found to resemble that of the anterior valve, which has no proper\r\nmedian area. In the posterior valve the median area is very small,\r\nwhile the sculpture of the rest of the valve corresponds to that of the\r\nlateral areas generally (see Fig. 261).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 263.--First, fourth, and eighth valves of a\r\n  _Chiton_, showing _l.i_, laminae of insertion; _n_, _n_, notches;\r\n  _s.l_, _s.l_, sutural laminae. × 2.]\r\n\r\nThe articulamentum of the intermediate valves is divided into two equal\r\nparts in the middle of the anterior edge, opposite to the beak, by a\r\n_sinus_. Each of the portions thus formed is again divided by a _notch_\r\nor suture into two unequal parts, the anterior of which is known as\r\nthe _sutural lamina_, and is more or less concealed by the valve in\r\nfront of it, while the lateral part, or _lamina of insertion_, is\r\nentirely concealed by the girdle. The articulamenta of the anterior and\r\nposterior valves are either simple or pierced by a series of notches\r\n(Fig. 263).\r\n\r\nThe girdle of the _Chitonidae_ varies considerably in character.\r\nSometimes its upper surface is simply corneous or cartilaginoid, with\r\nno other sculpture than fine striae, at others it is densely beset with\r\nspines or bristles, or tufted at intervals with bunches of deciduous\r\nhairs; again it is marbled like shagreen or mossy down, or covered with\r\nserpent-like scales. The width of the girdle varies greatly, being\r\nsometimes very narrow, sometimes entirely covering all the valves\r\n(_Cryptochiton_). As a rule, its outer edge is continuous, but in\r\n_Schizochiton_ it is sharply notched over the anus.\r\n\r\nA description has already been given of the dorsal eyes in Chiton (p.\r\n187), the nervous system (p. 202), the branchiae (p. 154), the radula\r\n(p. 228), and the generative system (p. 126).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 264.--Girdles of various Chitonidae. =A=,\r\n  _Radsia sulcata_ Wood, × 2; =B=, _Maugeria granulata_ Gmel., ×\r\n  3; =C=, _Enoplochiton niger_ Barnes, × 3; =D=, _Acanthochiton\r\n  fascicularis_ L., × 4; =E=, _Tonicia fastigiata_ Sowb., × 4.]\r\n\r\nThe recent Chitons are thus classified by Dr. W.

Single genus, _Choristes_.\r\n\r\nSECTION II. HETEROPODA.--Foot fin-shaped, not flat.\r\n\r\nThe Heteropoda are free-swimming Mollusca, being, like the Pteropoda,\r\nGasteropoda modified to suit their pelagic environment. Their nervous\r\nsystem is streptoneurous, and they are therefore probably derived from\r\nthe Prosobranchiata, but they are highly specialised forms. Pelseneer\r\nconsiders them far more widely removed from the Streptoneura than the\r\nPteropoda are from the Euthyneura. They swim on the surface “upside\r\ndown,” _i.e._ with the ventral side uppermost.\r\n\r\nThe tissues and shell are transparent, permitting observation of the\r\ninternal organs. In the Pterotrachaeidae the foot takes the form\r\nof a fan-shaped disc, usually furnished with a sucker. The body is\r\ncompressed at the posterior end, often with a ventral “fin.” In\r\n_Atlanta_ the foot consists of three very distinct parts: a propodium,\r\na mesopodium, on which is a small sucker, and a metapodium, which\r\ncarries the operculum. The branchiae are carried on the visceral sac,\r\nand are free in _Pterotrachaea_, slightly protected by the shell in\r\n_Carinaria_, and entirely covered in _Atlanta_; absent altogether in\r\n_Firoloida_.\r\n\r\nThe head carries two tentacles (except in _Pterotrachaea_),\r\nwith large, highly organised eyes on short lobes at their outer\r\nbase. The alimentary tract consists of a long protrusible proboscis,\r\nwith a taenioglossate radula (Fig. 132, p. 227), a long oesophagus,\r\nand a slightly flexured intestine. In _Atlanta_ the visceral\r\nsac is spiral and protected by a spiral planorbiform shell; in\r\n_Carinaria_ the visceral sac is small, conical, protected by a\r\nvery thin capuliform shell. There is no shell in _Pterotrachaea_\r\nor _Firoloida_.\r\n\r\nThe Heteropoda are dioecious. In the male there is a flagellum\r\nbehind the penis, which is near the middle of the right side.\r\n_Pterotrachaea_ lays long chains of granular eggs, and has\r\nbeen noticed to produce a metre’s length in a day. The eggs of\r\n_Atlanta_ are isolated. The embryo has a deeply bilobed velum.\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. _Pterotrachaeidae._--Body long, with a caudal “fin;” branchiae\r\ndorsal, free or partly protected by a shell; foot consisting of a\r\nmuscular disc, with or without a sucker.\r\n\r\n_Pterotrachaea_ proper has no mantle, shell, or tentacles. The\r\nbranchiae are disposed round the visceral sac, at the upper part of\r\nwhich is the anus. In _Firoloida_ the body is abruptly truncated\r\nbehind, with a long filiform segmented caudal appendage; visceral sac\r\nat the posterior end: fin-sucker present or absent in both male and\r\nfemale. _Cardiapoda_ resembles _Carinaria_, but the visceral sac is\r\nmore posterior and is only slightly protected by a very small spiral\r\nshell. _Carinaria_ (Fig. 279) has a rugose translucent skin, visceral\r\nsac sub-median, apparently pedunculated, covered by a capuliform shell.\r\nThe larval shell, which persists in the adult, is helicoid.\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. _Atlantidae._--Shell spiral, operculate, covering the animal.\r\nBranchiae in a dorsal cavity of the mantle; foot trilobed, with a small\r\nsucker on the mesopodium.\r\n\r\nThe shell of _Atlanta_ is discoidal and sharply keeled, while that of\r\n_Oxygyrus_ is nautiloid, with the spire concealed, no keel, aperture\r\ndilated.\r\n\r\n(_c_) GYMNOGLOSSA.--Radula and jaws absent; proboscis prominent, sexes\r\nprobably separate, penis present. The section is probably artificial\r\nand unnecessary, the families composing it being, in all probability,\r\nTaenioglossa which have lost their radula in consequence of changed\r\nconditions of life (pp. 79, 225).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 279.--_Carinaria mediterranea_ Lam., Naples:\r\n  _a_, anus; _br_, branchiae; _f_, foot; _i_, intestine; _m_,\r\n  mouth; _p_, penis; _s_, sucker; _sh_, shell; _t_, tentacles. × ½.]\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. _Eulimidae._--Proboscis very long, retractile, mantle\r\nforming a siphonal fold; shell small, long, subulate, polished;\r\nsuture shallow, aperture continuous, operculum present or absent.\r\nAnimal often parasitic, sucking the juices of its host by its long\r\nproboscis.

Opisthobranchiata=\r\n\r\nVisceral loop not twisted (except in _Actaeon_) in a figure of 8\r\n(Euthyneurous type, p. 203), auricle usually behind the ventricle,\r\nctenidium often replaced by secondary branchiae, pallial cavity, if\r\nexisting, more or less open, shell present or absent, operculum absent\r\n(except in _Actaeon_), animal hermaphrodite, with separate sexual\r\nopenings, marine only.--Carboniferous to present time.\r\n\r\nThe character of their nervous system decisively removes the\r\nOpisthobranchiata from the Prosobranchiata, and approximates them to\r\nthe Pulmonata. _Actaeon_, however, which is streptoneurous, as well\r\nas possessing an operculate shell with prominent spire, forms an\r\ninteresting link with the Prosobranchiata. At the opposite extreme\r\nto _Actaeon_ stand forms like _Siphonaria_ and _Gadinia_, which are\r\nprobably close links with the Pulmonata (p. 19). The generative\r\nsystem of the whole group, which is, as in the Basommatophora, of\r\nthe hermaphrodite type, without mutual fecundation, is another link\r\nof connexion with the Pulmonata. The respiratory organs present the\r\nmost varied forms, sometimes consisting of one ctenidium (never two),\r\nsometimes of secondary branchiae, variously placed, while sometimes no\r\nspecial organ exists.\r\n\r\nThe prolongation of the foot into lateral epipodia or parapodia\r\n(possibly to aid in swimming), and the effect of the epipodia upon the\r\nshell, according as they involve it completely or partially, are among\r\nthe most instructive features of the Opisthobranchiata. If the epipodia\r\nare developed on the anterior portion of the body, and do not become\r\nreflected, they may, as in most Pteropoda Thecosomata, not directly\r\naffect the shell. But when, as in the Tectibranchiata, the epipodia\r\nare medio-lateral, and tend to envelope the shell, their effect may\r\nbe traced by a series of forms varying in proportion to the amount\r\nof shell-surface covered by the epipodia. The two principal lines\r\nalong which modification takes place are the gradual reduction of the\r\nspiral nature of the shell, and the gradual lessening of its solidity.\r\nBoth these changes are the direct result of the additional protection\r\nafforded to the visceral mass by the reflected epipodia, which renders\r\nthe existence of a shell less and less necessary. A precisely similar\r\nline of change is seen in the Pulmonata, culminating in forms like\r\n_Arion_ (p. 174).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 286.--Illustrating the transition of form\r\n  in the shell of Tectibranchiata from the pointed spiral to the\r\n  almost flattened plate: =A=, _Actaeon_; =B=, _Aplustrum_; =C=,\r\n  _Cylichna_; =D=, _Atys_; =E=, _Philine_; =F=, _Dolabella_; =G=,\r\n  _Aplysia_; =H=, _Pleurobranchus_.

(Not drawn to scale.)]\r\n\r\nThe habits of life of the Opisthobranchiata are very varied. Some,\r\nespecially the heavier types, burrow in sand, and are then usually\r\nfurnished with a broad cephalic disc, as a digging apparatus; some\r\n(certain _Bulla_) flit about in shallow pools on mud flats; others\r\n(_Phyllirrhoe_ and the Pteropoda) swim freely in the open sea; others\r\n(most Nudibranchiata) crawl slug-like on sea-weeds or corallines, and\r\nin colour singularly harmonise with their environment (p. 71 f.);\r\nothers again (_Siphonaria_, _Gadinia_), stick limpet-like to rocks\r\nbetween tide marks. As a rule, they occur only in clean salt water,\r\nbut _Embletonia_ has been found in the Victoria Docks at Rotherhithe,\r\nas well as in parts of the Baltic, where the water has only 7 parts\r\nof salt in 1000, while _Limapontia_ occurs in nearly fresh water at\r\nBornholm and Gothland.\r\n\r\nTheir food varies greatly. As a rule, they are frugivorous, but many\r\ncases of carnivorous habit occur. _Scaphander_ has been seen to swallow\r\n_Dentalium_ six at a time, and in six hours the shells of all were\r\nreduced to tiny fragments. _Glaucus_ devours the soft portions of the\r\npelagic _Porpita_ and _Velella_; _Idalia elegans_ eats its way into\r\nthe test of Ascidians, and completely buries itself in the body of its\r\nprey.[403]\r\n\r\nThe Opisthobranchiata may be classified as follows:--\r\n\r\n                                             { _Bulloidea_\r\n                        { 1.

Single genus, _Corambe_ (=\r\n_Hypobranchiaea_). Bergh unites this and the two preceding families in\r\nthe group _Dorididae phanerobranchiatae_.\r\n\r\n=Sub-order IV.= =Pteropoda.=--The Pteropoda are pelagic animals in\r\nwhich the lateral portions of the foot are modified into fins, which\r\nare innervated by the pedal ganglia. Their systematic position has\r\nundergone recent revision. It has been the custom to regard them as an\r\nOrder of equivalent value to the other four, while some have held them\r\nto be a subdivision of Cephalopoda. Modern authorities, chief among\r\nwhom is Pelseneer, regard the Pteropoda not as a primitive, but as a\r\nderived and recent group. They are “Gasteropoda in which the adaptation\r\nto pelagic life has so modified their external characters as to give\r\nthem an apparent symmetry.”\r\n\r\nThe principal point which relates the Pteropoda to the Gasteropoda is\r\nthe asymmetry of the visceral organs, intestine, heart, kidney, and\r\ngenital gland, which results from their development on one side only\r\nof the body. Their hermaphroditism and the structure of their nervous\r\nsystem relate them to the Euthyneura rather than to the Streptoneura.\r\nResemblances in the organs of circulation and generation approximate\r\nthem to the Opisthobranchiata rather than to the Pulmonata, while\r\nof the two groups of the former, they tend to closer relationship\r\nwith the Tectibranchiata than with the Nudibranchiata. The two\r\nsections of Pteropoda have been considered of distinct origin, the\r\nThecosomata being derived from the Bulloidea, the Gymnosomata from the\r\nAplysioidea.[406]\r\n\r\nThus the Pteropoda are a group whose true relations are masked by the\r\nspecial conditions of their existence, which have tended towards the\r\ndevelopment of certain organs, the so-called “wings” and the shell,\r\nwhich give them an apparent symmetry; this symmetry disappears on a\r\ncloser investigation of the internal organs. They are hermaphrodite;\r\nthe genital gland has a single efferent duct (except in some\r\n_Cavolinia_), a seminal groove leading to the copulatory organ,\r\nwhich in the Thecosomata is on the right side of the head, in the\r\nGymnosomata on the right side of the foot. The genital system resembles\r\nthat of the Opisthobranchiata and of the “digonoporous” Pulmonata.\r\n\r\nSECTION 1. THECOSOMATA.--Shell or cartilaginoid test always present,\r\nfins united by an intermediate lobe, ctenidia as a rule absent,\r\nreplaced by secondary branchiae, no very distinct head or eyes, one\r\npair of tentacles; cerebral ganglia on the sides of and under the\r\noesophagus; radula with three rather large teeth in a row, generally\r\nunicuspid, jaw in two pieces, stomach with horny plates, anus generally\r\non the left side.\r\n\r\nThe Thecosomata feed on Protozoa and the lower Algae; they have no\r\nproboscis, and the intestine is flexured. The fins are always closely\r\nconnected with the head, or what answers to it. About 42 species are\r\nknown, belonging to 8 genera.\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. _Limacinidae._--Fins very large, branchial chamber dorsal, anus\r\non right side; shell spiral, sinistral (ultra-dextral, see p. 249),\r\noperculate. Genera: _Limacina_, shell helicoid, deeply umbilicated (_L.\r\nhelicina_ swarms in Arctic seas and furnishes food for many Cetacea);\r\n_Peraclis_, spire turreted, aperture large, elongated, produced\r\nanteriorly, no umbilicus; operculum sinistral, in spite of the shell\r\nbeing ultra-dextral.\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. _Cavoliniidae._--Fins large, branchial chamber ventral, shell\r\na non-spiral cone, angular or round, very thin, embryonic portion\r\ndistinct, or formed of two separate plates.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 290.--Illustrations of Pteropoda Thecosomata:\r\n  =A=, _Limacina australis_ Eyd.; =B=, _Cleodora cuspidata_ Bosc.\r\n  (shell only); =C=, _Cuvierina columnella_ Rang; =D=, _Creseis\r\n  virgula_ Rang; =E=, _Clio balantium_ Rang; _f_, _f_, fins; _l_,\r\n  liver; _o_, ovary; _sh_, shell. (After Souleyet.)]\r\n\r\nIn _Cavolinia_ (= _Hyalaea_, Fig. 5 B, p. 10) the shell consists of two\r\nplates, the ventral being convex, with one to three sharp spines at\r\nthe posterior end, the dorsal flatter, without spines. The aperture is\r\nbroad, contracted dorso-ventrally. Two long pointed prolongations of\r\nthe mantle project from the lateral slits of the shell, and probably\r\nserve to balance the bulky body when swimming. Fins trilobed at the\r\nmargin. _Cleodora_ has only rudimentary lateral prolongations, fins\r\nbilobed, shell triangular, angles greatly produced, aperture very\r\nwide, dorsal side keeled. In _Cuvierina_ the shell is straight,\r\nsub-cylindrical, with a median partition, slightly expanding towards\r\nthe apex, which is truncated in the adult. The principal sub-genera of\r\n_Clio_ are _Creseis_, which has an elongated sub-cylindrical shell,\r\nsometimes slightly curved, smooth or grooved; and _Clio_ proper, in\r\nwhich the shell is long, angular, with a dorsal rib, apex (= embryonic\r\nshell) rounded, constricted. _Styliola_ and _Hyalocylix_ also belong to\r\nthis group.\r\n\r\nFAM. 3. _Cymbuliidae._--Test (which is not homologous with the shell of\r\nother Thecosomata) slipper-shaped, cartilaginoid, simply a thickening\r\nof the mantle; embryo with a calcareous, spiral, operculate shell.\r\nGenera: _Cymbulia_, _Cymbuliopsis_, _Gleba_.\r\n\r\nThree other families, Hyalithidae, Pterothecidae, and Conulariidae,\r\nfrom Palaeozoic strata, are generally added to the Thecosomata. All\r\nare fossil only, and it is doubtful whether they are really Molluscan.\r\nPelseneer holds that no true fossil Pteropoda occur until the lower\r\nTertiaries.\r\n\r\nSECTION 2. GYMNOSOMATA.--Mantle and shell absent in the adult, fins not\r\nconnected by a lobe, no branchial chamber, head well developed, with\r\ntwo pairs of tentacles, eyes on the posterior pair; cerebral ganglia\r\nabove the oesophagus; buccal cavity provided with a pair of protrusible\r\n“hook-sacs,” radula generally with 4 to 12 hooked laterals, central\r\ntooth triangular, jaw in one piece, composed of horny plates, no horny\r\nplates in stomach, anus on the right side.\r\n\r\nThe Gymnosomata are carnivorous, feeding on Thecosomata and other\r\npelagic animals, being provided for this purpose with a formidable\r\nbuccal armature of hook-sacs and suckers. The intestine, as usual in\r\ncarnivorous groups, passes straight from the stomach to the anus; the\r\nfins are not attached to the head, but to the anterior part of the\r\nbody. The larva has a straight shell, which disappears in the adult.\r\nAbout 21 species are known, belonging to 7 genera.\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. _Pneumodermatidae._--Animal fusiform, fins rather small, head\r\nprominent, anterior part of buccal cavity protrusible, with suckers on\r\nthe ventral side, hook-sacs well marked; branchia on right side, skin\r\nsoft, pigmented. Genera: _Dexiobranchaea_, no posterior gill, hook-sacs\r\nshort; _Spongiobranchaea_, posterior gill circular; _Pneumoderma_, gill\r\ntetraradiate, hook-sacs long.\r\n\r\nFAM. 2. _Clionopsidae._--Body barrel-shaped, proboscis three times the\r\nlength of the body, no buccal appendages; hook-sacs short, no lateral\r\ngill, posterior gill tetraradiate, skin not pigmented. _Clionopsis_ is\r\nthe single genus.\r\n\r\nFAM. 3. _Notobranchaeidae._--Body ovate, buccal appendages conical,\r\nno lateral gill, posterior gill with three radiating crests, skin\r\npigmented. _Notobranchaea_ is the single genus.\r\n\r\nFAM. 4. _Clionidae._--Body long, angulated behind, proboscis short,\r\nmouth with two or three pairs of appendages, no jaw, no gills.\r\n\r\n_Clione limacina_ is so abundant in Arctic seas as at times to colour\r\nthe surface for miles. Each of the cephalic appendages has about 60,000\r\nminute pedicellated suckers.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 291.--=A=, Anterior portion of _Pneumoderma_;\r\n  =B=, _Clione limacina_ Phipps; =C=, _Halopsyche Gaudichaudi_\r\n  Soul.; _f_, _f_, fins; _h.s_, _h.s_, hook-sacs; _l.f_, lobe of\r\n  the foot; _s_, _s_, suckers; _o_, posterior genital orifice; _t_,\r\n  _t_, tentacles.

There are two long non-retractile buccal appendages.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Order IV. Pulmonata=\r\n\r\nGasteropoda with two pairs of tentacles, visceral loop euthyneurous,\r\nganglia concentrated round the oesophagus; breathing air by a\r\npallial cavity formed by the union of the front edge of the mantle\r\nwith the cervical region, sexes united, shell present or absent, no\r\noperculum[407] (except in _Amphibola_).\r\n\r\n=Sub-order I.= =Basommatophora.=--Eyes generally at the base of the\r\ntentacles, which are not retractile, male and female genital orifices\r\nseparate, radula (p. 235) multiseriate, shell always present, external.\r\nFresh water or quasi-marine.\r\n\r\nFAM. 1. _Auriculidae._--Breathing organ a pulmonary sac or true lung;\r\nshell spiral, conoidal, internal partitions usually absorbed, aperture\r\nmore or less strongly toothed.

(After Lacaze-Duthiers.)]\r\n\r\nThe Scaphopoda form a small but very distinct class, whose organisation\r\nis decidedly of a low type. The body is usually slightly curved, the\r\nconcave side being the dorsal; muscles near the posterior end attach\r\nthe body to the shell. The foot, which can be protruded from the\r\nanterior or wider aperture, is rather long, pointed, and has sometimes\r\ntwo lateral lobes (_Dentalium_), sometimes a terminal retractile disc\r\n(_Siphonodentalium_), sometimes a retractile disc with a central\r\ntentacle (_Pulsellum_). The cephalic region, as in Pelecypoda, is\r\ncovered by the mantle. The mouth is situated on a kind of projection\r\nof the pharynx; the buccal mass, containing the radula (p. 236), is\r\nat the base of the foot, and the intestine branches forward from the\r\nfront part of the stomach. The liver (Fig. 299) is paired, and consists\r\nof a number of symmetrical, radiating coeca. There are no eyes, but\r\non each side of the mouth are small bunches of exsertile filaments\r\n(_captacula_), which appear to act as tactile organs for the seizing\r\nof food. There is no special respiring apparatus, heart or arterial\r\nsystem, breathing being conducted by the walls of the mantle. The\r\nnervous system has already been described (p. 205).\r\n\r\nTwo kidneys open on either side of the anus. The genital gland is\r\nlarge, occupying nearly all the posterior part of the body, the sexual\r\nproducts being emitted through the right kidney. The veliger has\r\nalready been figured (p. 131, Fig. 44). The embryonic shell is formed\r\nof two calcareous laminae, which subsequently unite to form the tube.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their general relationships, the Scaphopoda resemble\r\nthe Gasteropoda in their univalve shell, and in the possession of a\r\nradula; while the pointed foot, the non-lobed velum in the veliger, the\r\ngenerative system, the bilateral symmetry of the organs generally, and\r\nthe absence of any definite head, eyes, or tentacles, are points which\r\napproximate them to the Pelecypoda.\r\n\r\nThe Scaphopoda are known from Devonian strata to the present time. They\r\nare found at a depth of a few fathoms to very deep water. The only\r\nthree genera are _Dentalium_, _Siphonodentalium_ (subg. _Cadulus_), and\r\n_Pulsellum_, which differ in the structure of the foot, as described\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CLASS PELECYPODA\r\n\r\nCephalic region rudimentary, mantle consisting of two symmetrical right\r\nand left lobes, covering the body and secreting a bivalve shell hinged\r\nat the dorsal margin; no radula, sexes usually separate. Reference has\r\nalready been made to the reproductive system (p. 145), breathing organs\r\n(p. 164 f.), mantle (p. 172), nervous system (p. 205), digestive system\r\n(p. 237 f.), and nomenclature of the various parts of the shell (p. 269\r\nf.).\r\n\r\nThe shape of the shell, in many Pelecypoda, involving as it does the\r\nposition, size, and number of the adductor muscles, is probably due to\r\nmechanical causes, depending on the habits and manner of life of the\r\nindividual genus. Thus in a typical dimyarian or two-muscled bivalve,\r\n_e.g._ _Mya_ (Fig. 300, A), the adductor muscles lie well towards each\r\nend of the long axis of the shell, with the hinge about midway between\r\nthem. In this position they are best placed for effectually closing the\r\nvalves, and since they are nearly equidistant from the axis of motion,\r\n_i.e._ from the hinge, they do an equal amount of work, and are about\r\nequal in size. But in a form like _Modiola_, where the growth of the\r\nshell is irregular in relation to the hinge-line, the anterior muscle\r\nis brought nearer and nearer to the umbones, where its power to do\r\nwork, and therefore its size, becomes less and less. But the work to\r\nbe done remains the same, and the posterior muscle has to do it nearly\r\nall; hence it moves farther and farther away from the hinge-line, and\r\nat the same time gains in size. In shells like _Ostrea_, _Pecten_,\r\nand _Vulsella_, the anterior muscle, having drawn into line with the\r\nhinge and the posterior muscle, becomes atrophied, while the posterior\r\nmuscle, having double work to do, has doubled its size.[409]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 300.--Illustrating changes in the position\r\n  and size of the adductor muscles according to the shape of the\r\n  shell: =A=, _Mya_; =B=, _Modiola_; =C=, _Vulsella_. The upper\r\n  dotted line shows the hinge-line, the lower connects the two\r\n  muscles.]\r\n\r\nThe development of the foot, again, largely depends upon habits of\r\nlife. It is well developed in burrowing forms, while in sessile genera\r\n(_Ostrea_, _Chama_, _Spondylus_) it becomes unnecessary and aborts.\r\nEven in _Pecten_, which does not become sessile, but has ceased to use\r\nthe foot as an organ of progression, a similar result follows. Forms\r\nwhich burrow deeply often “gape” widely, sometimes at one end only,\r\nsometimes at both. _Venus_, _Donax_, _Tellina_, _Mactra_, which are\r\nshallow burrowers, do not gape; _Solen_, _Lutraria_, and to a less\r\ndegree _Mya_, burrow deeply and gape widely. In order to burrow deeply\r\nthe foot must be highly developed, and the larger it becomes, the\r\nmore will it tend to keep the valves apart at the place where it is\r\nhabitually protruded. Burrowing species always remain in communication\r\nwith the surface by means of their siphons, the constant extension of\r\nwhich tends to keep the valves apart at the end opposite to the foot.\r\nBurrowing species, again, tend to burrow in such a way as to descend\r\nmost easily, and not be impeded by their own shells; in other words,\r\nthey act as a wedge, and descend with their narrowest part foremost.\r\nBut the burrowing organ, the foot, has to follow suit, and gradually\r\ndraws round to the narrowest part of the shell, so that the habitual\r\ndeep burrower, such as _Lutraria_, lies with its long axis exactly at\r\nright angles to the surface, its siphons protruding from, and keeping\r\nopen, the uppermost or posterior margin of the shell, and the foot\r\nproducing the same effect upon the lower or anterior margin. The deeper\r\nthe burrower, the more elongated does the shell become, until, through\r\nforms like _Pholas_ and _Saxicava_, we arrive at _Solen_, the most\r\nhighly specialised burrower of all, in which the breadth of the shell\r\nis equal throughout, and no obstructive curve exists to impede its\r\nrapid ascent or descent.\r\n\r\nThe Pelecypoda have been classified in various ways; by the\r\ncompleteness or sinuation of the pallial line, depending on the absence\r\nor presence of siphons, by the number of adductor muscles, by the\r\ncharacter of the hinge-teeth, and by the number of the branchiae.\r\nFor various reasons, none of these methods have proved entirely\r\nsatisfactory. That adopted here was suggested by Pelseneer, and\r\ndepends upon the character of the branchiae themselves, as suggesting\r\nsuccessive stages of development (p. 166 f.).\r\n\r\n\r\n                      =Order I.

Whereas at the present time\r\nthe number of extant species amounts to but about 120, Davidson in\r\nhis admirable monograph[410] on the British Fossil Brachiopoda has\r\nenumerated close upon 1000 fossil species, found within the limits of\r\nthe United Kingdom alone.\r\n\r\nThe amount of interest that the group in question has excited amongst\r\nnaturalists is evinced by the invaluable Bibliography of Brachiopoda,\r\nprepared by the same author and his friend W. H. Dalton.[411] This\r\nmonument of patient research contains over 160 quarto pages, each with\r\nthe titles of from eighteen to twenty separate papers dealing with\r\nBrachiopods, published between the years 1606 and 1885.\r\n\r\nProbably the first reference to Brachiopods in zoological literature\r\nis to be found in a work entitled _Aquatilium et Terrestrium aliquot\r\nAnimalium_, published in the year 1606 by Prince Fabio Colonna at Rome.\r\nThis work contains the first description of a Brachiopod under the\r\nname of _Concha diphya_. In a second edition, which is not so rare in\r\nour libraries as the first, the author mentions three more species\r\nof Brachiopods. Towards the end of the same century, Martin Lister of\r\nOxford, in his _Historia sive Synopsis methodica Conchyliorum_ which\r\nappeared in parts, described and figured a considerable number of\r\nBrachiopods, which, under the name of _Anomia_, were until the present\r\ncentury regarded as Molluscs, and placed in the subdivision Pelecypoda\r\n(Lamellibranchiata).\r\n\r\nThe first satisfactory figure and description of a _Terebratula_ were\r\npublished in the year 1766, in Pallas’ _Miscellanea Zoologica_, still\r\nunder the name _Anomia_. In 1781 O. F. Müller figured a _Crania_, under\r\nthe name _Patella anomala_, the generic name being subsequently altered\r\nby Cuvier into _Orbicula_.\r\n\r\nBruguière in the year 1789 was the first to recognise the relationship\r\nbetween _Lingula_ and the other Brachiopods. He for the first time\r\nsaw the stalk of this genus, and compared it with that of the stalked\r\nBarnacles, a class of animals which has been more than once associated\r\nwith our group.\r\n\r\nCuvier in his _Mémoire sur l’Anatomie de la Lingule_, 1797, gave\r\nthe first account of the internal anatomy of a Brachiopod. The same\r\nnaturalist first described the nephridia, although his mistake in\r\nconsidering them lateral hearts was not rectified until the middle of\r\nthe present century, when Huxley pointed out that these structures\r\nserve as excretory ducts for the genital products.\r\n\r\nDuméril in 1807 proposed the somewhat unfortunate name of Brachiopoda;\r\nand although efforts have been made by de Blainville, who suggested\r\nPalliobranchiata, and more recently by Haeckel, who proposed\r\nSpirobranchiata, to arrive at a name which would be both grammatically\r\nand physiologically more correct, the older name has maintained its\r\nposition, and is now universally in use.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 and 1835 Professor Owen published the results of his researches\r\ninto the anatomy of the Brachiopoda. He investigated in these years the\r\nstructure of _Waldheimia flavescens_, of a species of _Lingula_ and of\r\na _Discina_, called by him _Orbicula_. He regarded the group as midway\r\nbetween the Pelecypoda and the Ascidians. The structure of _Lingula_\r\nwas further investigated by Carl Vogt, who in 1851 also supported the\r\nview that the Brachiopoda were related to the Mollusca. But already\r\nin 1847 and 1848 Steenstrup had thrown doubts upon this relationship,\r\nand had maintained that the Order was more closely related to certain\r\nmembers of the Chaetopoda, a view which afterwards found its ablest\r\nsupporter in the American naturalist Morse.\r\n\r\nD’Orbigny seems to have been the first observer who drew attention\r\nto the resemblances alleged to exist between the Brachiopoda and the\r\nPolyzoa, and Hancock, in his masterly works _On the Anatomy of the\r\nFresh-water Bryozoa_ (_Polyzoa_) and in his _Organisation of the\r\nBrachiopoda_, dwelt on these resemblances, and placed the Brachiopoda\r\nbetween the Polyzoa on the one hand and the Ascidians on the other; a\r\ncollocation which subsequently resulted in their inclusion in the now\r\ndiscarded group of Molluscoidea.\r\n\r\nIn 1854 Huxley[412] published what is, with the possible exception of\r\nHancock’s monograph, mentioned above, the most important work upon the\r\nanatomy of the Brachiopoda with which we are acquainted. He corrected\r\nnumerous errors of his predecessors and added many new facts to our\r\nknowledge of the group. He was the first to describe the true nature\r\nof the lateral hearts of Cuvier, and to describe the true heart,\r\nafterwards so carefully figured by Hancock.\r\n\r\nA further step was made in 1860 and 1861 by the discovery and\r\ndescription of the larvae of Brachiopoda, by F. Müller and\r\nLacaze-Duthiers. Since that time we owe what little advance has been\r\nmade in the embryology of the group to the researches of Morse and of\r\nKowalevsky.\r\n\r\nModern methods of research--section cutting, etc.--were first applied\r\nto the group by the Dutch naturalist, van Bemmelen,[413] from whose\r\nadmirable historical account of our knowledge of the group many of the\r\nabove facts have been gathered. These methods have thrown considerable\r\nlight upon the histology of the group, but have not added very much to\r\nour knowledge of the structure or the affinities of the Brachiopoda.\r\nThe modern views as to the latter point may be best discussed after\r\nsome account of the anatomy of the various genera has been given.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =The Shell=\r\n\r\nThe body of a Brachiopod is enclosed within a bivalve shell, but the\r\ntwo halves are not, as they are in the Pelecypoda, one on each side\r\nof the body, but occupy a different position with regard to the main\r\naxes of the body. What this position is, has formed the subject of a\r\ngood deal of discussion. For our purpose, however, it will suffice\r\nto distinguish the two valves by the most commonly accepted terms of\r\n_dorsal_ and _ventral_. The former is, as a rule, the smaller\r\nof the two, and usually lies on the lower surface of the animal in\r\nlife. Adopting the orientation indicated above, the stalk by means of\r\nwhich the Brachiopoda are attached to the rocks and stones, etc., upon\r\nwhich they live, becomes posterior, and the broader edge of the two\r\nshells, which are capable of being opened to some extent, is anterior.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: _Fig. 312._--Four specimens of _Terebratulina\r\n  caput serpentis_, attached to a waterlogged piece of wood, from\r\n  the Clyde area.]\r\n\r\nThe posterior end of the shell usually narrows, and the ventral valve\r\nprojects behind the dorsal, and may be produced into a sort of beak\r\nor funnel, through the aperture of which the stalk protrudes. This\r\naperture may be completed by the ventral shell, or the latter may only\r\nbe notched, in which case the hole is completed by the posterior edge\r\nof the dorsal shell.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the shell has been used in classifying the group into two\r\norders:--\r\n\r\n   I. The Ecardines, whose shell is chitinous but slightly\r\n   strengthened by a deposit of calcareous salts. There is no hinge\r\n   and no internal supports for the arms. The alimentary canal\r\n   terminates in an anus.\r\n\r\n   II. The Testicardines, whose shells are composed of calcareous\r\n   spicules. The valves are hinged together, and there is usually\r\n   an internal skeleton supporting the arms. There is no anus.\r\n\r\nThe outside of the shell of recent Brachiopods is often smooth, but\r\nmany are ridged. In a recent species, _Rhynchonella Döderleini_ from\r\nJapan, Davidson[414] has described a number of spines arranged in\r\nconcentric circles on the ribbed shell. They are not so long as the\r\nspines irregularly scattered on the shell of _Rh. spinosa_ from the\r\nJurassic formations. Some shells are brightly coloured, as, for\r\ninstance, the various species of _Cistella_ which live on the coralline\r\nrock in the Mediterranean; these exhibit bands or rays of alternate\r\norange and bright pink. On the other hand, the shells of _Terebratula\r\nvitrea_ are of a slightly translucent white, and of the utmost\r\ndelicacy. They are very large, so that the cavity within the valves is\r\nof much greater size than the body of the animal, but in other genera\r\nthe soft parts are packed very closely, and there is but a very small\r\nmantle-cavity or space within the shell unoccupied by the body of the\r\nanimal. It is, however, more common for the shells of Brachiopods to be\r\nof a dull yellowish colour, and to be somewhat massive. Most species\r\nare attached by a pedicle or stalk to some rock or stone at the bottom\r\nof the sea, but in some, as in _Crania_, the ventral valve becomes\r\nclosely adherent to its support, so much so that it is difficult, or\r\nimpossible, to remove the animal without leaving the ventral valve\r\nbehind. _Lingula_, like _Crania_, one of the Ecardines, lives in sand\r\n(Fig. 321, p. 483), and does not use its long pedicle to adhere to any\r\nfixed object. . The outline of the shell varies extremely. It may be\r\nalmost round or prolonged along either axis; the edges of the valves\r\nmay be smooth or fluted in correspondence with the ridges and grooves\r\nof the outside of the shell.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 313.--Three specimens of _Crania anomala_ on\r\n  a stone dredged in Loch Fyne. The topmost specimen is seen in\r\n  profile.]\r\n\r\nOn the inner surface of the shell of the Testicardinate Brachiopoda,\r\nat the hinder end of the ventral valve, are two lateral teeth, which\r\nfit into corresponding sockets in the dorsal valve. These form a\r\nhinge, which in many cases is so arranged as to permit the shell\r\nto be opened to only a very limited extent. There are also certain\r\nplate-like processes which project into the lumen of the shell, and\r\nhelp to support various portions of the body; and in _Terebratula_,\r\n_Waldheimia_, etc., these form a complicated band-like loop, which\r\nincreases in complexity with advancing age, and serves to support the\r\narms. In the extinct _Spirifera_ the internal skeleton takes the form\r\nof two spirally coiled lamellae, which almost entirely fill the cavity\r\nof the shell; the apices of the spirals point outwards (Fig. 330). The\r\ninner surface of the shell also bears the marks of the insertion of the\r\nnumerous muscles which govern its movements.\r\n\r\nMicroscopic examination of thin sections of the shell shows that it\r\nconsists of small prisms or spicules of calcareous substance, whose\r\nlong axis lies, roughly speaking, at right angles to the surface of the\r\nshell. These spicules are held together by an organic matrix, in which,\r\nhowever, no cellular elements can be detected. In sections made through\r\na decalcified shell the position of the spicules which have been\r\ndissolved by the acid is indicated by spaces, and the matrix remains\r\nas a network of fibrils, which end on the outside in a thin cuticular\r\nlayer of organic matter. In _Lingula_ and _Discina_ the organic matter\r\ntakes a much larger share in the formation of the shell, which in\r\nthese genera consists of a number of alternating layers of horny and\r\ncalcareous matter. The former is described by Gratiolet as fibrillated,\r\nthe fibrils being obliquely placed, whilst the latter consists of a\r\nnumber of small prisms set at right angles to the surface of the shell.\r\n\r\nIn many genera, as in _Terebratula_, _Terebratella_, _Cistella_,\r\n_Waldheimia_, _Crania_, etc., the shell is pierced by a number of small\r\ncanals (Fig. 314), which in the dried specimens form so many open\r\npores, but in the living animal contain prolongations of the mantle\r\nor body wall which secretes the shell. They contain extensions of the\r\nlayer of epithelial cells which lines and secretes the shell. The\r\ncanals come to the surface and at their outer end are often slightly\r\nswollen. They are closed by the cuticular layer which is mentioned\r\nabove as covering the shell externally. They are not found in the loops\r\nor other internal processes of the shell. In _Crania_ the canals depart\r\nto some extent from the usual type; instead of running a straight\r\ncourse to a somewhat swollen outer end, they break up into a number of\r\nvery fine branching tubules, which form a very minute meshwork near\r\nthe surface of the shell. These fine branches contain protoplasmic\r\nfibrils, which have their origin in the epithelial cells which lie in\r\nthe tubules.\r\n\r\nBy carefully counting the number of tubules in a given area of young\r\nand old specimens of _Waldheimia cranium_, van Bemmelen[415] was able\r\nto show that the spaces between the tubules did not increase with age.\r\nHe therefore reasoned that the shells of Brachiopoda do not increase by\r\nintussusception, and that their increase in size must be entirely due\r\nto additions made round their free edge.\r\n\r\nThe function of the tubules has been a matter of some discussion.\r\nThey have been regarded as respiratory organs, but it would seem more\r\nreasonable to suppose that they serve as organs to supply nourishment,\r\netc., to the organic matrix of the shell.[416]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the genus _Crania_, it is usual for Brachiopods\r\nto bear round the edge of their mantle rows or bundles of chitinous\r\nsetae or bristles (Figs. 315 and 319). The length and arrangement of\r\nthese structures vary in the different species; they are secreted from\r\nlittle pits in the edge of the mantle. It seems probable that they\r\nserve to some extent as organs of defence, especially in the larva,\r\nwhere they make their appearance at an early stage; possibly they also\r\nserve as a filter, and prevent the entrance of foreign bodies into\r\nthe shell. Their presence has been taken to indicate a certain degree\r\nof affinity between Brachiopods and Chaetopods, since setae are very\r\ncharacteristic of the last-named group.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              =The Body=\r\n\r\nThe shell of a Brachiopod is secreted partly by the general surface of\r\nthe body which is situated at the hinder end of the shell, and partly\r\nby the two leaf-like extensions of the body, which are termed the\r\ndorsal and ventral mantles. These are, in fact, folds of the body wall,\r\nand into them the body cavity and certain of its contents, such as the\r\nliver and generative glands, etc., extend. The space between the two\r\nfolds of the mantle, which is limited behind by the anterior wall of\r\nthe body, is termed the pallial or mantle cavity. On each side of the\r\nmiddle line the anterior wall of the body is produced into two “arms,”\r\nwhich occupy as a rule a considerable part of the mantle cavity. These\r\narms may be but flattened portions of the general body wall, which\r\noccupies a large part of what in other genera is the mantle of the\r\ndorsal valve, as in _Cistella_ and _Argiope_;[417] or they may be\r\noutgrowths of the body wall in the form of long processes, which are\r\ncoiled and twisted in a very characteristic manner in the various\r\ngenera. In any case the cross section of the arm shows a groove, one\r\nside of which forms a continuous lip, and the other takes the form of\r\na single row of tentacles, which are richly ciliated and capable of\r\nconsiderable movement. The whole arm in _Rhynchonella_ can be protruded\r\nfrom the shell, as was noted years ago by O. F. Müller, and although\r\nhis statement to this effect has often been doubted, its truth was\r\nconfirmed by Professor Morse,[418] who writes: “In the year 1872,\r\nwhile studying living _Rhynchonella_ in the St. Lawrence, I observed a\r\nspecimen protrude its arms to a distance of 4 c.m. beyond the anterior\r\nborders of the shell, a distance nearly equalling twice the length of\r\nthe shell.” The same observer also mentions that _Lingula_ has the\r\npower of partially protruding its arms. In most genera the cirrhi or\r\ntentacles can alone be protruded.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 314.--View of the left half of _Cistella_\r\n  (_Argiope_) _neapolitana_, which has been cut in two by a median\r\n  longitudinal incision, to show the disposition of the organs.\r\n  Partly diagrammatic. The inorganic part of the shell only is\r\n  shown. The tubular extensions of the mantle and the organic outer\r\n  layer are not indicated, and hence the pores appear open.\r\n\r\n    1. The ventral valve.\r\n    2. The dorsal valve.\r\n    3. The stalk.\r\n    4. The mouth.\r\n    5. Lip which overhangs the mouth and runs all round the tentacular\r\n         arms.\r\n    6. Tentacles.\r\n    7. Ovary in dorsal valve.\r\n    8. Liver diverticula.\r\n    9. Occlusor muscle; its double origin is shown.\r\n    10. Internal opening of left nephridium.\r\n    11. External opening of left nephridium.\r\n    12. Ventral adjuster. The line from 10 crosses the dorsal adjuster.\r\n    13. Divaricator muscle.]\r\n\r\nThe cilia which clothe the tentacles keep up a constant flow of water\r\ninto the mantle cavity. This stream not only serves to aerate the blood\r\nof the animals--a process which probably takes place through the thin\r\ninner lining of the mantle--but it also brings with it a number of\r\ndiatoms and other minute organisms which serve as food. These particles\r\nbecome entangled in the tentacles, and are ultimately lodged in the\r\ngroove at their base, and passing along this by the action of the cilia\r\nthey find their way into the wide mouth, into which the groove deepens\r\nin the posterior median line.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =The Digestive System=\r\n\r\nThe mouth leads into an oesophagus; this widens into a chamber which\r\nmay be termed the stomach (Fig. 314), and which receives the openings\r\nof two large branching glands usually known as the liver. The stomach\r\npasses into a short intestine which is usually bent at about a right\r\nangle with the oesophagus. In the Testicardines the intestine ends\r\nblindly, but in the Ecardines it is of much greater length, and\r\nterminates in an anus, situated posteriorly in the median line in\r\n_Crania_, but asymmetrical and to the right of the body in _Lingula_\r\n(Fig. 315) and _Discina_; in both cases, however, the opening is into\r\na portion of the mantle cavity. The alimentary canal is supported by\r\na median dorsal and ventral mesentery, and by two pairs of lateral\r\nmesenteries which pass to the body wall. The lateral mesenteries are\r\nnot always quite distinct. When they are, the anterior pair are known\r\nas the gastro-parietal bands, and the posterior as the ileo-parietal.\r\nIn _Rhynchonella_ there are two pairs of renal organs, and each of\r\nthese mesenteries bears the internal openings of one pair. In all other\r\nBrachiopods there is only one pair, and they are supported by the\r\nileo-parietal bands.\r\n\r\nThe alimentary canal is ciliated throughout, and some interesting\r\nobservations have been made by Schulgin[419] on the shortening of\r\nthese cilia in _Argiope_ (_Cistella_) when the animal is well fed,\r\nand their elongation when the animal is hungry. Amongst the ciliated\r\ncells certain glandular cells have been described. The so-called liver\r\nconsists of two more or less branching glands, which open by wide\r\napertures, one on each side of the stomach. It seems probable that a\r\ngood deal of digestion is carried on in these glands, since the diatoms\r\nand other minute organisms upon which the Brachiopoda live are usually\r\nfound in the branches of these glands, and the glandular cells lining\r\nthe tubules vary much in appearance according to the animal’s state of\r\nnutrition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =The Body Cavity=\r\n\r\nThe alimentary canal and liver occupy a considerable portion of the\r\nbody cavity or general space of the body; this space is to some extent\r\ncut up by the various mesenteries above mentioned. It also lodges the\r\nreproductive organs and the excretory ducts. Its walls are ciliated,\r\nand the action of the cilia keeps in motion the corpusculated fluid\r\nthat bathes the various organs in the body cavity. The mantles, which\r\nare nothing but flattened leaf-like extensions of the body wall lining\r\nthe shell, also contain diverticula of the body cavity, which may be\r\nsimple flattered spaces or may be broken up into definite channels, as\r\nin _Lingula_ (Fig. 315). It seems not improbable that the body\r\ncavity fluid is aerated through the thin inner layer of the mantle.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 315.--View of the inner side of a valve\r\n  of _Lingula anatifera_ (after François), to show the definite\r\n  arrangement of the channels in the mantle: _a_, position of\r\n  mouth; _b_, position of anus.]\r\n\r\nRunning along the base of each arm are two canals, a small one at the\r\nbase of the tentacles, which we may term the tentacular canal, and a\r\nlarger one, the canal of the lip. The former sends a prolongation into\r\neach tentacle. The latter is, according to Blochmann, a closed canal\r\nin _Crania_, _Lingula_, _Rhynchonella_, and others; but according\r\nto Joubin,[420] it communicates in _Crania_ at one point with the\r\ntentacular canal. It is probably originally a part of the body cavity.\r\nBlochmann[421] states in very definite terms that in _Crania_ neither\r\nthe large canal nor the small canal communicates with the general body\r\ncavity, but he admits that in _Lingula_ the small canal opens into that\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =The Circulatory System=\r\n\r\nThe details of the discovery of the central circulatory organ of\r\nBrachiopods form a curious and instructive chapter in the history of\r\nmodern morphological inquiry. Hancock, in his monograph on the group,\r\ndescribed and figured on the dorsal surface of the alimentary canal a\r\nwell-developed heart, which had been previously noticed by Huxley, who\r\nfirst showed that the organs which up to his time had been regarded\r\nas hearts were in reality excretory organs. In connexion with this\r\nheart Hancock described numerous arteries, distributed to various\r\nparts of the body. The observers who have written upon the anatomy of\r\nBrachiopods since Hancock’s time, in spite of the fact that they had\r\nat their disposal such refined methods of research as section cutting,\r\nwhich was quite unknown at the time his monograph was written, have\r\nalmost all failed to find this circulatory system, and many of them\r\nhave been tempted to deny its existence. Blochmann,[422] however,\r\nin the year 1885 stated that he had found the heart, and had seen\r\nit pulsating in several species of Brachiopoda which he had rapidly\r\nopened whilst alive. Joubin has also described it in large specimens of\r\n_Waldheimia venosa_, and recently Blochmann has published a detailed\r\naccount of his work on this subject. Both these authors describe\r\nthe heart as a vesicle with muscular walls, situated dorsal to the\r\nalimentary canal. From this, according to Blochmann, a vessel--the\r\nbranchio-visceral of Hancock--runs forward as a triangular split in the\r\ndorsal mesentery supporting the alimentary canal. This vessel divides\r\ninto two at the oesophagus, and passing through some lacunae in the\r\nwalls of this tube, opens into the tentacular canal, and consequently\r\nsupplies the tentacles with blood. These two canals which diverge\r\nfrom the median artery are connected ventrally by a vessel which runs\r\nbelow the oesophagus; the latter is therefore surrounded by a vascular\r\nring. Blochmann also describes two pairs of vessels that were seen\r\nand figured by Hancock. A pair of these pass over the gastro-parietal\r\nmesenteries and into the dorsal mantle sinus, the second pair pass\r\nover the ileo-parietal mesenteries and into the ventral mantle sinus;\r\neach of these four arteries runs to one of the four generative\r\nglands, which, as is so usually the case in the animal kingdom, have\r\nthus a specially rich blood supply. If this description should prove\r\nto be correct, the vascular system of Brachiopods shows a striking\r\nresemblance to that of the closed vascular system of the unarmed\r\nGephyrea, except that the former group has specialised genital vessels.\r\nThe blood is colourless.\r\n\r\nJoubin’s description of the vascular system of _W. venosa_ differs\r\nin some respects from that of Blochmann. He regards the heart as\r\ncollecting the lymph which it receives from numerous lacunar spaces in\r\nthe walls of the alimentary canal, and distributing it through various\r\nvessels, which in the main correspond with those of Blochmann, and\r\nwhich run both to the “arms” and to the generative glands. The latter\r\nvessels, however, open freely into the body cavity, and the fluid which\r\nis forced out from their openings freely bathes the organs found in\r\nthe body cavity. Whichever of these accounts should prove to be more\r\nclosely in accordance with the facts, there is little doubt that in\r\naddition to the true blood there is a corpusculated fluid in the body\r\ncavity which is to some extent kept in motion by the ciliated cells\r\nthat line its walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =The Excretory Organs=\r\n\r\nThe excretory organs (kidneys) which were at one time regarded by\r\nCuvier and Owen as hearts, are typical nephridia--that is to say,\r\nthey are tubes with glandular excretory walls which open at one end\r\nby a wide but flattened funnel-shaped opening into the body cavity,\r\nand at the other end by a circular pore to the exterior (Fig. 314).\r\nIn _Rhynchonella_, where there are two pairs of these tubes,--the\r\nonly evidence that the group presents of any metameric repetition of\r\nparts,--the inner ends of the anterior pair are supported by the\r\ngastro-parietal mesenteries, and those of the posterior pair by the\r\nileo-parietal mesenteries. In all other Brachiopods the posterior pair\r\nalone exists. The external opening of these nephridia is near the base\r\nof the anus; in _Cistella_ it is at the bottom of a brood-pouch formed\r\nby the tucking in of the body wall in this neighbourhood, and in this\r\nbrood-pouch the eggs develop until the larval stage is reached.\r\n\r\nThe walls of these nephridia are lined by ciliated cells, amongst\r\nwhich are some excretory cells, in which numerous brown and yellow\r\nconcretions are to be seen; these are probably the nitrogenous excreta\r\nof the animal, and pass out of the body, being washed away by the\r\nstream of water which is constantly passing between the shells.\r\n\r\nAs in so many other animals, the nephridia act as genital ducts, and\r\nthrough them the ova and spermatozoa, which break off from the genital\r\nglands and fall into the body cavity, find their way to the outer world.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =The Stalk and Muscles=\r\n\r\nThe body cavity of a Brachiopod is traversed by several pairs of\r\nmuscles, which are very constant in position, and whose contraction\r\nserves to open and close the shell, to move the animal upon its stalk,\r\nand to govern the movements of the arms.\r\n\r\nThe stalk is absent in _Crania_, and the members of this genus are\r\nattached to the rocks on which they are found by the whole surface of\r\ntheir ventral valve. In _Lingula_ (Fig. 315) the stalk is long and\r\nhollow, containing what is probably a portion of the body cavity,\r\nsurrounded by muscular walls. _Lingula_ is not a fixed form, but lives\r\nhalf-buried in the sand of the sea-shore (Fig. 321). _Discina_, the\r\nother member of the Ecardines, has a peduncle which pierces the ventral\r\nvalve and fixes the animal to its support. Amongst the Testicardines,\r\n_Thecidium_ is also fixed to its supports by the surface of its ventral\r\nvalve; the other genera, however, are provided with stalks, which,\r\nbeing the means of the fixation of the animals, become at the same\r\ntime the fixed points upon which their very limited movements can be\r\neffected. The stalk protrudes through the notch or aperture at the\r\nposterior end of the ventral valve, and it probably belongs to the\r\nventral side of the body. It is in _Cistella_, and doubtless in other\r\ngenera, in close organic connexion with both valves, and it seems to\r\nconsist of an unusually large development of the supporting tissue\r\nwhich occurs so frequently in the body of Brachiopods. The surface of\r\nthe peduncle is produced into several irregularities and projections\r\nwhich fit into any depressions of the rock upon which the animal is\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\nIn _Cistella_ there are four pairs of muscles, two connected with\r\nopening and closing the shell, and two with the movement of the body\r\nupon the stalk (Fig. 314). The most considerable of these muscles are\r\nthe two occlusors, which have their origin, one on each side of the\r\nmiddle line of the dorsal valve, and their insertion by means of a\r\ntendon into the ventral valve. In the species in question each of these\r\nmuscles arises by a double head, the two muscles thus formed probably\r\nrepresenting the anterior and posterior occlusors of other forms. The\r\ncontraction of these muscles undoubtedly serves to close the shell,\r\nwhich is opened by a small pair of divaricators arising from the\r\nventral valve, and inserted into a portion of the dorsal shell which\r\nis posterior to the axis of the hinge. Contraction of these muscles\r\nwould thus serve to approximate the posterior edges of the valves and\r\ndivaricate the anterior edges and thus to open the shell.\r\n\r\nThe adjustors are four in number, a ventral pair running from the\r\nventral valve to be inserted into the stalk, and a corresponding dorsal\r\npair from the dorsal valve. The simultaneous contraction of either pair\r\nwould tend to raise the valve, whilst the alternate contraction of the\r\nmuscles of each side would tend to rotate the shell upon the peduncle.\r\nThe muscles of _Waldheimia flavescens_ are shown in Fig. 329, and\r\ndescribed briefly on p. 502.\r\n\r\nThe muscles of the Ecardines differ from those of the Testicardines\r\ninasmuch as they do not terminate in a tendon, but the muscle fibres\r\nrun straight from shell to shell. They are also more numerous. In\r\n_Crania_ there is an anterior and a posterior pair of occlusor\r\nmuscles, and two pairs of oblique muscles, which seem when they\r\ncontract together to move the dorsal shell forwards, or when they\r\ncontract alternately to slightly rotate it. In this genus there are\r\nalso a pair of protractors and a pair of retractors, and two levators\r\nof the arms, whose function is to draw forward or retract the arms, and\r\nan unpaired median or levator ani muscle. In addition to these bundles\r\nof muscles there are certain muscles in the body wall, and it seems\r\nprobable that by their contraction, when the adductors are relaxed,\r\nthe body may become somewhat thicker and the valves of the shells will\r\nslightly open.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 316.--A semi-diagrammatic figure of the\r\n  muscular system of _Crania_ (after Blochmann): _a_, anterior\r\n  occlusor; _b_, posterior occlusor; _c_, superior oblique; _d_,\r\n  inferior oblique; _e_, retractor of the arms; _f_, elevator of\r\n  the arms; _g_, protractor of the arms; _h_, unpaired median\r\n  muscle. The dorsal valve is uppermost.]\r\n\r\nIn _Lingula_ (Fig. 322) the muscular system is more complicated;\r\nin addition to the anterior (= anterior laterals) and posterior\r\n(= centrals) pairs of occlusors, there is a single divaricator (=\r\numbonal), whose contractions in conjunction with those of certain\r\nmuscles in the body wall press forward the fluid in the body cavity,\r\nand thus force the valves of the shell apart; and there are three pairs\r\nof adjustor muscles. These latter are called respectively the central\r\n(= middle laterals), external (= external laterals), and posterior\r\n(= transmedians) adjustors, whose action adjusts the shells when all\r\ncontract together, and brings about a certain sliding movement of the\r\nshells on one another when they act independently of each other.[423]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =The Nervous System=\r\n\r\nThe nervous system of Brachiopods is not very clearly understood, and\r\nthere are considerable discrepancies in the accounts of the various\r\ninvestigators, even when they are dealing with the same species. So\r\nmuch, however, seems certain, that there is a nervous ring surrounding\r\nthe oesophagus, that this ring is enlarged dorsally, or, in other\r\nwords, near the base of the lip, into a small and inconspicuous dorsal\r\nganglion, and again ventrally or just behind the base of the tentacles\r\ninto a ventral or sub-oesophageal ganglion. The latter is, contrary\r\nto what is usual in Invertebrates, of much larger size than the\r\nsupra-oesophageal ganglion, but like the last named, it has retained\r\nits primitive connexion with the ectoderm or outermost layer of the\r\nskin. Both ganglia give off a nerve on each side which runs to the\r\narms and along the base of the tentacles and lips. The sub-oesophageal\r\nganglion also gives off nerves which supply the dorsal and ventral\r\nfolds of the mantle, the muscles, and other parts.\r\n\r\nThe modified epithelium in connexion with the ganglia may possibly have\r\nsome olfactory or tactile function, but beyond this the Brachiopoda\r\nwould appear to be devoid of eyes, ears, or any other kind of sense\r\norgans,--a condition of things doubtless correlated with their sessile\r\nhabits, and with the presence of a bivalved shell which leaves no part\r\nof their body exposed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =The Reproductive System=\r\n\r\nThe majority of Brachiopods are bisexual, and many authorities regard\r\nthe separation of sex as characteristic of the group; on the other\r\nhand, _Lingula pyramidata_ is stated to be hermaphrodite, and it is not\r\nimpossible that other species are in the same condition.\r\n\r\nThe generative organs are of the typical sort, that is, they are formed\r\nfrom modified mesoblastic cells lining the body cavity. These cells are\r\nheaped up, usually in four places, and form the four ovaries or testes\r\nas the case may be (Fig. 314). The generative glands usually lie partly\r\nin the general body cavity and partly in the dorsal and ventral mantle\r\nfolds, two on each side of the body. Along the axis of the heaped-up\r\ncells runs a blood-vessel, which doubtless serves to nourish the\r\ngland, the outer surface of which is bathed in the perivisceral fluid.\r\nEvery gradation can be found between the ripe generative cell and the\r\nordinary cell lining the body cavity. When the ova and spermatozoa\r\nare ripe they fall off from the ovary and testis respectively into\r\nthe body cavity, thence they are conveyed to the exterior through the\r\nnephridia. The ova in certain genera, such as _Argiope_, _Cistella_,\r\nand _Thecidium_, develop in brood-pouches which are either lateral\r\nor median involutions of the body wall in the neighbourhood of the\r\nexternal opening of the nephridia; they are probably fertilised there\r\nby spermatozoa carried from other individuals in the stream of water\r\nwhich flows into the shell. In other species the ova are thrown out\r\ninto the open sea, and their chances of meeting with a spermatozoon is\r\nmuch increased by the gregarious habits of their sessile parents, for\r\nas a rule considerable numbers of a given species are found in the same\r\nlocality.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =The Embryology=\r\n\r\nWe owe what little we know of the Embryology of the group chiefly to\r\nKowalevsky,[424] Lacaze-Duthiers,[425] and Morse.[426] The Russian\r\nnaturalist worked on _Cistella_ (_Argiope_) _neapolitana_, the French\r\non _Thecidium_, and the American chiefly on _Terebratulina_.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is not known with any certainty, it seems probable that\r\nthe eggs of Brachiopods are fertilised after they have been laid, and\r\nnot whilst in the body of the mother. The spermatozoa are doubtless\r\ncast out into the sea by the male, and carried to the female by the\r\ncurrents set up by the cilia clothing the tentacles.\r\n\r\nIn _Thecidium_, _Cistella_, and _Argiope_ the first stages of\r\ndevelopment, up to the completion of the larva, take place in\r\nbrood-pouches; in _Terebratulina_ the eggs pass out of the shell of\r\nthe mother and hang in spermaceti-white clusters from her setae and on\r\nsurrounding objects. In the course of a few hours they become ciliated\r\nand swim about freely. The brood-pouch in _Thecidium_ is median, in\r\nthe convex lower shell, in _Cistella_ it is paired, and arises by the\r\npushing in of the lateral walls of the body in the region just behind\r\nthe horse-shoe-shaped tentacular arms; the renal ducts, which also\r\nserve as oviducts, open into these lateral recesses.\r\n\r\nIn the female _Thecidium_ (Fig. 317) the two median tentacles which lie\r\njust behind the mouth are enlarged and their ends somewhat swollen;\r\nthey are bent back into the brood-pouch, and to them the numerous\r\nlarvae are attached by a short filament inserted into the second of the\r\nfour segments into which the larva is divided. In _Cistella_ a similar\r\nfilament attaches the larvae to the walls of the brood-sac; thus they\r\nare secured from being washed away by the currents constantly flowing\r\nthrough the mantle cavity of the mother.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 317.--Brood-pouch of _Thecidium\r\n  mediterraneum_. (After Lacaze-Duthiers.) Part of the wall of the\r\n  pouch has been removed to show the clusters of larvae.\r\n\r\n   1. Mouth, overhung by lip.\r\n\r\n   2. One of the two median tentacles which are enlarged and\r\n   modified to bear the larvae.\r\n\r\n   3. Wall of brood-pouch into which the median tentacles are\r\n   folded.\r\n\r\n   4. Larva attached to the swollen end of the tentacles.]\r\n\r\nIn _Cistella_ the larva consists at first of two segments, but the\r\nanterior one divides into two, so that in the free swimming larva\r\nwe find three segments, the hindermost somewhat longer and narrower\r\nthan the others and destined to form the stalk. About the time of\r\nthe appearance of the second segment four red eye-spots arise in the\r\nanterior segment, which tends to become constricted off from the\r\nothers, and may now be termed the head. It gradually becomes somewhat\r\numbrella-shaped, develops cilia all over its surface and a special ring\r\nof large cilia round its edge.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the second or mantle segment has grown down and\r\nenveloped the stalk, and four bundles of setae have arisen from its\r\nedge. In this stage the larva leaves its mother’s shell and swims\r\nout into the world of water to look for a suitable place on which to\r\nsettle down. This is the only stage in the life history of a Brachiopod\r\nwhen the animal is locomotor, and can serve to spread its species.\r\nThe extreme minuteness of the larva and the short time it spends in\r\nthis motile condition probably accounts for the fact that Brachiopods\r\nare extremely localised. Where they do occur they are found in great\r\nnumbers, rocks being often almost covered with them, but they are not\r\nfound over large areas. When viewed under a microscope the larvae seem\r\nto be moving with surprising rapidity, but judging from the analogy of\r\nother forms, it seems doubtful if they swim a yard in an hour.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 318.--Young larva of _Cistella neapolitana_,\r\n  showing three segments, two eye-spots, and two bundles of setae.\r\n  (After Kowalevsky.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 319.--Full-grown larva of _Cistella\r\n  neapolitana_, with umbrella-shaped head, ciliated. (After\r\n  Kowalevsky.)]\r\n\r\nFrequently the larva stands on its head for some time, as if\r\ninvestigating the nature of the rocks on which it may settle; it\r\nis extremely contractile, turning its head from time to time, and\r\nseldom retaining the same outline for any length of time; the setae\r\nare protruded, and at times stick out in every direction; they are\r\npossibly defensive in function. When fully stretched out the larva is\r\nabout ⅓ mm. long, but it frequently shortens its body to two-thirds\r\nof this length. The larvae are of a pinkish red colour, with eye-spots\r\nof ruby red. Their colour renders them difficult to discern when they\r\nare swimming over the red coralline rocks upon which they frequently\r\nsettle. After swimming about for a few hours the larva fixes itself\r\nfinally, apparently adhering by some secretion produced by the stalk\r\nsegment. The folds of the second or body segment then turn forward\r\nover the head, and now form the ventral and dorsal mantle folds; these\r\nat once begin to secrete the shell on their outer surfaces. The head\r\nwith its eye-spots must be to some extent absorbed, but what goes on\r\nwithin the mantle is not accurately known. The setae drop off and the\r\ntentacular arms begin to appear as a thickening on the dorsal lobe of\r\nthe mantle. They are at first circular in outline. The various changes\r\nwhich the larva passes through are well illustrated by Morse for\r\n_Terebratulina_, which spawns at Eastport, Me., from April till\r\nAugust. The different stages are represented in outline in Fig. 320,\r\ntaken from his paper.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 320.--Stages in the development of the larva\r\n  of _Terebratulina septentrionalis_. (After Morse.) The youngest\r\n  larva has two segments, a third then appears, the larva then\r\n  fixes itself, and the second segment folds over the first and\r\n  develops bristles round its edge.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               =Habits=\r\n\r\nThere is little to be said about the habits and natural history of the\r\nBrachiopoda. When once the larva has settled down, the animal never\r\nmoves from the spot selected; occasionally it may rotate slightly from\r\nside to side on its stalk, and from time to time it opens its shell. As\r\nso frequently is the case with sessile animals, the sense organs are\r\nreduced to a minimum, the eyes of the larva disappear, and the only\r\ncommunication which the animal has with the world around it is by\r\nmeans of the currents set up by the cilia on the tentacles.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the absence of any definite eyes, _Thecidium_, according to\r\nLacaze-Duthiers, is sensitive to light; he noticed for instance that,\r\nwhen his shadow fell across a number of these animals he was watching\r\nin a vessel, their shells, which had been previously gaping, shut up at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nIn _Cistella_ the tentacles can be protruded from the open shell, and\r\nin _Rhynchonella_ the spirally-coiled arms can be unrolled and extruded\r\nfrom the shell, but this does not seem to have been observed in other\r\ngenera, with the possible exception of _Lingula_. The food of these\r\nanimals consists of minute fragments of animal and vegetable matter, a\r\nvery large proportion of it being diatoms and other small algae.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 321.--Figures illustrating the tubes in which\r\n  _Lingula anatifera_ lives. The upper figure is a view of the\r\n  trilobed opening of the tube. The lower figure shows the tube\r\n  in the sand laid open and the animal exposed. The dotted line\r\n  indicates the position of the body when retracted. The darker\r\n  portion is the tube of sand agglutinated by the secretion of the\r\n  stalk. (After François.)]\r\n\r\n_Lingula_ differs markedly from the other members of the group,\r\ninasmuch as it is not firmly fixed to a rock or some such body by a\r\nstalk or by one of its valves, but lives in a tube in the sand. Some\r\nrecent observations of Mons. P. François[427] on living specimens of\r\n_Lingula anatifera_ which he found living in great numbers on the\r\nsea-shore at Nouméa in New Caledonia may be mentioned. The presence of\r\nthe animal is shown by a number of elongated trilobed orifices which\r\nlead into the tube in which the _Lingula_ lives. The animals, like most\r\nother Brachiopods, live well in captivity, and he was able to watch\r\ntheir habits in the aquaria of his laboratory. The _Lingula_ place\r\nthemselves vertically; the anterior end of the body just reaches the\r\nlevel of the sand; the three lobes into which the orifice of the tube\r\nis divided corresponding with the three brushes of setae which project\r\nfrom the anterior rim of the mantles. These setae are described by\r\nMorse as projecting in the form of three funnels; currents of water are\r\nseen continually passing in at the side orifices and out through the\r\ncentral. The tube consists of two portions: an upper part, which is\r\nflattened to correspond with the flat shape of the body, and a lower\r\npart, in which the stalk lies. The upper part is lined with a layer of\r\nmucus, but the sand is not glued together to form a definite tube. The\r\nlower part of the stalk, or the whole when the animal is contracted, is\r\nlodged in a definite tube composed of grains of sand agglutinated by\r\nmucus, probably secreted from the walls of the stalk. At the least sign\r\nof danger the stalk is contracted violently, and the body is withdrawn\r\nto the bottom of the upper portion of the tube. The rapid retreat of\r\nthe animal is followed by the collapse of the sand at the mouth of the\r\ntube, and all trace of the presence of the _Lingula_ is lost.\r\n\r\nThe shells of this species are frequently rotated through a small angle\r\nupon one another, a movement which is prevented in the Testicardines\r\nby the hinge. In very young transparent specimens François was able\r\nto observe the movements of the fluid in the system of tubules which\r\npenetrate the mantle; these tubules are figured by him, and Fig. 315 is\r\ntaken from his illustration.\r\n\r\nDavidson in his Monograph on the British Fossil Brachiopoda states\r\nthat the largest “recent Brachiopod which has come under my notice is\r\na specimen of _Waldheimia venosa_ Solander, measuring 3 inches 2 lines\r\nin length, by 2 inches in breadth, and 1 inch 11 lines in depth.” It\r\nwas found in the outer harbour of Fort William, Falkland Islands, in\r\n1843. A specimen of _Terebratula grandis_ from the Tertiary deposits,\r\nhowever, exceeds this in all its dimensions. Its length was 4½ inches,\r\nits breadth 3 inches 2 lines, and its depth 2 inches 2 lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =Distribution in Space=\r\n\r\nBrachiopods are very localised; they live in but few places, but when\r\nthey are found they usually occur in great numbers. During the cruise\r\nof the _Challenger_, dredging was conducted at 361 stations; at only\r\n38 or 39 of these were Brachiopoda brought up. Mr. Cuming, quoted\r\nby Davidson, records that after a great storm in the year 1836, he\r\ncollected as many as 20 bushels of _Lingula anatifera_ on the sea-shore\r\nat Manilla, where, he relates, they are used as an article of food. It\r\nhas been suggested above that their abundance in certain localities is\r\ndue to their limited powers of locomotion, which are effective but for\r\na few hours, the larva being, moreover, so minute that unless borne by\r\na current it could not travel far from its parent. When once settled\r\ndown it has little to fear from the attacks of other animals. The\r\nsize of its shell relative to its body would deter most animals from\r\nregarding it as a desirable article of food, and as far as is known\r\nat present the Brachiopoda suffer but little from internal parasites,\r\nthe only case I know being a minute parasitic Copepod belonging to a\r\nnew and as yet unnamed genus which I found within the mantle cavity\r\nof _Cistella_ (_Argiope_) _neapolitana_ in Naples. Their slight value\r\nas an article of diet has doubtless helped to preserve them through\r\nthe long periods of geological time, through which they have existed\r\napparently unchanged.\r\n\r\nTwo of the recent genera of the family Lingulidae, _Lingula_ and\r\n_Glottidia_, are usually found between tide-marks or in shallow water\r\nnot exceeding 17 fathoms. _Discina_ is also found about the low-tide\r\nlevel, but one species at any rate, _Discinisca atlantica_, has been\r\ndredged, according to Davidson, “at depths ranging from 690 to nearly\r\n2425 fathoms.” Their larvae frequently settle on the shells of their\r\nparents, and thus numbers of overlapping shells are found clustered\r\ntogether. _Crania_ is usually dredged from moderate depths down to 808\r\nfathoms, adhering to rocks, lumps of coral, stones, and shells.\r\n\r\nOf the Testicardines, _Terebratula Wyvillei_ has probably been found at\r\nthe greatest depth, _i.e._ 2900 fathoms, in the North Pacific. It is\r\ninteresting to note that its shell is glassy and extremely thin. The\r\nBrachiopoda are, however, as a rule, found in shallower water; they\r\nabound up to a depth of 500 or 600 fathoms, after which they rapidly\r\ndiminish with increasing depth. About one-half the named species occur\r\nat a depth of less than 100 fathoms.\r\n\r\nThe vertical range of depth of certain species is great; _Terebratula\r\nvitrea_ is recorded from 5 to 1456 fathoms, _T. Wyvillei_ from 1035\r\nto 2900 fathoms. This is to some extent explicable since, after a\r\ncertain depth has been reached, many of the external conditions, such\r\nas absence of temperature and light, must remain constant even to the\r\ngreatest depths of the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe area of the ocean explored by dredging forms such an infinitesimal\r\nfraction of the whole, that it seems superfluous to consider the\r\nhorizontal distribution of Brachiopods. A few facts may, however,\r\nbe mentioned. Certain species, as _Terebratula vitrea_, _T. caput\r\nserpentis_, _Waldheimia cranium_, _Megerlia truncata_, and _Discinisca\r\natlantica_, have a very wide if not cosmopolitan distribution. The\r\nsecond of the above named extends as far north as Spitzbergen, and as\r\nfar south as Kerguelen Island. Many species are, on the other hand,\r\nvery localised, and have hitherto only been found in one place. A very\r\nconsiderable number of these have been dredged off Japan and Korea, and\r\nthis region may be to some extent regarded as the headquarters of the\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nThe following species have been obtained within the limits of the\r\nBritish Area, as defined by Canon Norman, who has been good enough to\r\nrevise the list, which is founded on that drawn up by Davidson in his\r\nChallenger Report. Their range of bathymetric distribution is given in\r\nthe column on the left.\r\n\r\n    Depth in\r\n    Fathoms\r\n\r\n   0 to 1180.   _Terebratulina caput           Oban, and off Cumbrae\r\n                   serpentis_ Lin.

This family contains one species of\r\n                           _Discina_ and six of _Discinisca_.\r\n\r\n    F. LINGULIDAE.         This family consists of eight species of\r\n                            _Lingula_ and three of _Glottidia_.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to come to any satisfactory conclusion as to the\r\nposition of the group Brachiopoda with relation to the rest of the\r\nanimal kingdom. They have, in accordance with the views of various\r\ninvestigators, been placed in close connexion with many of the large\r\ngroups into which the Invertebrates are split up. The Mollusca, the\r\nTunicata, the Polyzoa, the Chaetopoda, the Gephyrea, and of recent\r\ntimes such isolated forms as _Phoronis_ and _Sagitta_, have all in turn\r\nhad their claims advanced of relationship to this most ancient group.\r\nAs far as I am in a position to judge, their affinities seem to be\r\nperhaps more closely with the Gephyrea and with _Phoronis_ than with\r\nany of the other claimants; but I think even these are too remote to\r\njustify any system of classification which would bring them together\r\nunder a common name. Investigation into the details of the embryology\r\nof the group, more especially into that of the Ecardines, might throw\r\nsome light on this subject, and it is much to be desired that this\r\nshould be undertaken without delay. That the group is a most ancient\r\none, extending from the oldest geological formations, we know, that the\r\nexisting members of it have changed but little during the vast lapse\r\nof time since their earliest fossil ancestors flourished, we believe;\r\nbut we are in almost total ignorance of the origin or affinities of\r\nthe group, and we can hardly hope for any light on the subject except\r\nthrough embryological research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BRACHIOPODA\r\n\r\n                                PART II\r\n                   PALAEONTOLOGY OF THE BRACHIOPODA\r\n\r\n                                  BY\r\n\r\n                    F.

It is a most fortunate circumstance that the\r\nexcellent state of preservation in which we frequently find them, and\r\nthe immense amount of material at our disposal, enable us to determine\r\nwith accuracy and certainty the internal characters of the shells in\r\nthe great majority of cases. But it is only since the beginning of the\r\npresent century that our knowledge of the anatomy of the soft parts\r\nof the living animal has rendered any tracing of homologies possible.\r\nIn the case of features in fossil extinct types the interpretation\r\nmust be to some extent doubtful. Barrande, Clarke, Davidson, Hall,\r\nKing, Oehlert, Waagen, de Verneuil, and a host of other workers have\r\ncontributed to the information which we now possess; and their works\r\nmust be consulted for details of the subject.[428]\r\n\r\nSince all Brachiopods are inhabitants of the sea, the geologist at once\r\nrecognises as a marine deposit any bed which contains their remains.\r\nUnder favourable conditions they swarmed in the seas of Palaeozoic\r\nand Mesozoic times. Beds of limestone are frequently almost entirely\r\ncomposed of their shells, as, for instance, some of the Devonian\r\nlimestones of Bohemia. Often they give the facies to the fauna and\r\noutnumber in species and individuals all the other organisms of the\r\nperiod. The Ungulite Sandstone (Cambrian) of Russia and the Productus\r\nLimestone of the Salt Range in India of Carboniferous and Permian age\r\nare well-known examples.\r\n\r\nMany species seem to have been gregarious in habit; thus _Productus\r\ngiganteus_ of the Carboniferous Limestone may generally be found in\r\ncrowded masses, as in some localities in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nThe fact that certain species of Brachiopods characterise definite\r\nstratigraphical horizons or “zones” gives them occasionally an\r\nimportance equal to that of Graptolites; for instance, the Ecardinate\r\nspecies _Trematis corona_ marks a set of beds in the Ordovician, and\r\nthe isolated _Stringocephalus Burtini_ is restricted to the upper part\r\nof the Middle Devonian, giving to the limestone on that horizon its\r\ndistinctive name. It is noteworthy also how certain species affect a\r\nsandy and others a calcareous sea-bottom, so that beds of the same\r\nage show differences in their Brachiopod fauna owing to a dissimilar\r\nlithological composition.\r\n\r\nWhile few of the recent Brachiopods reach a large size, some of the\r\nextinct species measure several inches in breadth, but the great\r\n_Productus giganteus_ attained the width of even a foot.\r\n\r\nThe bright colours of the shells of the living animals are not\r\ngenerally preserved amongst the fossil species from the older rocks;\r\nyet in a Carboniferous _Terebratula_ we can even now detect the purple\r\nbands in some specimens, and a Cretaceous _Rhynchonella_ similarly\r\nexhibits its original colour.\r\n\r\nThe Brachiopoda are evidently a group in its decline, as the geological\r\nrecord shows; but they date back from the earliest known fossiliferous\r\nrocks, in which the Ecardinate division is alone represented. As we\r\nascend through the stratigraphical series the number and variety of\r\ngenera and species belonging to both divisions rapidly increase until\r\nin the united Ordovician and Silurian there are nearly 2000 species and\r\nabout 70 genera. From this point of maximum development down to the\r\npresent day there is a gradual decrease in numbers.\r\n\r\nAccording to Davidson, at least 17 Upper Tertiary species are still\r\nliving on our sea-bottoms; and many recent Mediterranean forms occur in\r\nthe Pliocene rocks of the islands and shores of that sea, and in the\r\nCrags of East Anglia.\r\n\r\nA brief review of the chief characteristics of fossil Brachiopoda\r\nis given below. Those genera which have the greatest zoological or\r\ngeological importance can alone be noticed owing to the exigencies of\r\nspace.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             I. ECARDINES\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =External Characters=\r\n\r\nA considerable diversity of external form is met with even in this\r\ndivision, from the limpet-like _Discina_ to the flattened tongue-shaped\r\n_Lingula_. The valves have most commonly a smooth external surface with\r\ndelicate growth-lines; but sometimes pittings (_Trematis_) or radiating\r\nribs (_Crania_) are present, and in a few forms the shell is furnished\r\nwith spines (_Siphonotreta_), which perhaps serve to anchor it in the\r\nsoft mud of the sea-bottom. The usual mode of fixation was by means of\r\nthe pedicle (= peduncle or stalk), which either (1) passed out simply\r\nbetween the posterior gaping portion of the valves (_Lingula_), or (2)\r\nlay in a slit in the ventral valve (_Lingulella_), or (3) pierced the\r\nsubstance of the latter valve by a definite foramen (_Discina_). The\r\nfirst-mentioned condition of the pedicle seems the most primitive.\r\nRarely the pedicle was absent, and the shell was attached by the whole\r\nsurface of the ventral valve (_Crania_, p. 467).\r\n\r\nThe two valves in the fossil Ecardines were held together by muscular\r\naction, though in some families (_Trimerellidae_) we see traces of\r\narticulating processes. The “hinge line,” or line along which the\r\nvalves worked as on a hinge, is in most forms more or less curved. A\r\n“hinge area” (_i.e._ that portion of the shell generally smoother than\r\nother parts of the valves, more or less triangular in form, and lying\r\nbetween the beaks on one or both sides of the hinge line), is usually\r\nabsent in the Ecardines.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 322.--Muscle-scars of _Lingula anatina_.\r\n  Inner surface of =A=, Pedicle-valve or ventral valve. =B=,\r\n  Brachial or dorsal valve; _p.s_, parietal scar; _u_, umbonal\r\n  muscle; _t_, transmedians; _c_, centrals; _a.m.e_, laterals (_a_,\r\n  anteriors; _m_, middles; _e_, externals).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 323.--_Trimerella._ (After Davidson and\r\n  King.) =A=, Inner surface of pedicle-valve or ventral valve: _a_,\r\n  pseudo-deltidium; _b_, deltidial slope; _c_, deltidial ridges;\r\n  _d_, areal borders; _e_, cardinal callosities; _f_, cardinal\r\n  facet; _g_, lozenge; _i_, umbonal chambers separated by cardinal\r\n  buttress; _j_, platform; _k_, platform vaults; _l_, median plate;\r\n  _m_, median scars; _n_, anterior scars; _o_, lateral scars; _p_,\r\n  post-median scars; _q_, crown crescent; _r_, side or lateral\r\n  crescent; _s_, end or terminal crescent; _t_, transverse scars;\r\n  _u_, archlet (vascular sinuses); _w_, sub-cardinal scars; _x_,\r\n  umbo-lateral scars. =B=, Brachial or dorsal valve: _e_, cardinal\r\n  sockets; _j_, platform; _k_, platform vaults; _l_, median plate;\r\n  _m_, median scars; _n_, anterior scars; _q_, crown crescent; _r_,\r\n  side or lateral crescent; _s_, end or terminal crescent; _t_,\r\n  transverse scars; _u_, archlet (vascular sinuses); _v_, cardinal\r\n  scars; _w_, sub-cardinal scars.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Internal Characters=\r\n\r\nOwing to the rarity of well-preserved interiors of valves in this\r\ndivision, our knowledge of their internal characters is still far\r\nfrom satisfactory. The arrangement of the muscular impressions varies\r\ngreatly amongst extinct genera, but we are often able to interpret\r\nthem with a considerable amount of certainty by a study of the scars\r\nand the muscles of the well-known recent _Lingula_ (Fig. 322). The\r\nextreme specialisation of the muscles in many of the earliest genera\r\n(_e.g._ _Lingula_) is remarkable, and points to a long but so far\r\nundiscovered ancestry in pre-Cambrian times.[429] In fossil species\r\nof _Crania_ and _Lingula_ the muscle-scars correspond closely with\r\nthose in the living representatives of these genera. In the most\r\nhighly specialised family of the Ecardines--the _Trimerellidae_--we\r\nmeet with features of peculiar interest.[430] The muscle-scars in this\r\nfamily (Fig. 323, A, B) are most remarkable for the development of the\r\nso-called “crescent,” (_q.r.s._) which skirts the posterior margin of\r\nboth valves as a sub-cardinal impression. It is believed to be the\r\ntrace of a strong post-parietal muscular wall, analogous in position\r\nto that of _Lingula_. The three pairs of “lateral” muscle-scars in\r\nthe latter genus seem to be represented by the “terminal” (_s_) and\r\n“lateral” (_r_) scars on the crescent of the _Trimerellidae_. A\r\npair of “transverse” scars (_t_) occurs in each valve between the\r\n“terminals” and the antero-lateral edge of the “platform” (_j_).\r\n“Cardinal” (_v_), “sub-cardinal” (_w_), and “umbo-lateral” (_x_) scars\r\nalso occur. The median impression which covers the “platform” (_j_)\r\nconsists of a central, lateral, and usually an anterior pair of scars;\r\nand the impressions of the genital organs, according to Davidson\r\nand King, lie medianly posterior to the “platform.” The “platform”\r\nitself is a more or less conspicuous central calcareous elevated area\r\noccurring in each valve, but most developed in the dorsal; in some\r\ncases it is double-chambered with tubular cavities (“platform vaults,”\r\nFig. 323, A, B, _k_), in others it is more or less solid. It appears to\r\nhave originated through a posterior shifting of the central muscular\r\nbands, that they might be inserted behind the liver; at the same time a\r\ndeposition of shelly material, to form fulcra to work the heavy valves,\r\ntook place at these points. The tunnelling-out of the platform was\r\nprobably due to the continual pressure of the lobes of the liver. The\r\ndivision of the umbonal cavity into definite chambers in _Monomerella_,\r\nand to a less extent in other members of this family, appears,\r\naccording to Davidson and King, to have been caused by pressure of the\r\novarian lobes.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the foregoing remarks on the development of the\r\n“platform,” it may be mentioned that the paths along which the\r\nmuscle-bands move, as the shell of Brachiopods increases in size, are\r\nmarked by elongated scars, and often by shelly deposits; and when the\r\nmembers of a muscle-pair come into juxtaposition these shelly deposits\r\n(which act as fulcra for the muscles) combine, and by the growth\r\nof the shell form a septum, as in the case of the median septum of\r\n_Lingulepis_.\r\n\r\nThe _Obolidae_ show some important features in the internal\r\nimpressions. _Obolella crassa_ (Hall) may be taken as a well-known\r\ntype of the family. In this species a pair of small scars, one on each\r\nside of the pedicle-groove, lies close under the hinge line in the\r\nventral valve. There is also a well-marked scar for the insertion of\r\nthe pedicle-muscle at the end of the pedicle-groove. A pair of much\r\nelongated lateral impressions extending forward from the “cardinals”\r\nmay be homologous with the “laterals” of _Lingula_; and the two small\r\ncentral scars between them may be compared with the “centrals” of\r\n_Lingula_ which are in a somewhat similar position. In the dorsal valve\r\nof _O. crassa_ a pair of “cardinals” is found, and on each side of a\r\nlow median rounded ridge are two small “central” scars. Indistinct\r\n“lateral” scars arise close to or in the central area, and diverge\r\nanteriorly.\r\n\r\nSometimes a great concentration of muscle-scars occurs round the\r\nforamen in the ventral valve, as in _Siphonotreta_.\r\n\r\nAs regards the minute structure and composition of the shell in\r\nthe Ecardines, we find that the _Lingulidae_ and _Discinidae_ have\r\ntheir shell composed of alternating layers of phosphate of lime and\r\na corneous substance; the former layers are pierced by microscopic\r\ncanals. The _Craniidae_ have calcareous shells traversed by tubules,\r\nwhich divide into many fine branches near the external surface; a thin\r\nperiostracum covers the exterior. The _Trimerellidae_ have heavy thick\r\ncalcareous shells, for which they required the previously-described\r\nelaborate arrangement of muscles to open and shut them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           II. TESTICARDINES\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =External Characters=\r\n\r\nIt is to this division that the great majority of the Brachiopoda\r\nbelong; and the diversity of form, of ornamentation, and of internal\r\ncharacters is correspondingly greater than in the Ecardines.\r\n\r\nA transversely or longitudinally oval shape of shell is the commonest;\r\nbut sometimes it is triangular, as in _Rhynchonella_ (Fig. 327), or\r\nbilobed, as in _Pygope_ (= _Terebratula diphya_). The ventral valve is\r\nusually more convex than the dorsal, and the former may be prolonged\r\ninto a tube by the accelerated growth and infolding of the anterior\r\nand lateral margins, producing a very abnormal form (_Proboscidella_).\r\nThe external surface of the valves is frequently ornamented with more\r\nor less prominent radiating ribs; and fine concentric growth-lines\r\nare commonly shown, and may be developed into coarse ridges or\r\nwrinkles, particularly in old individuals. The members of the family\r\n_Productidae_ are usually furnished with tubular spines, which are\r\nsometimes of great length, and served to anchor the free shells in the\r\nmud, or were twisted round Crinoid stems and similar objects.\r\n\r\nIn the ventral valve of many genera there is a median sinus, with\r\na corresponding fold in the dorsal valve, and rarely _vice versâ_;\r\nsometimes the fold and sinus are double.\r\n\r\nThe hinge line is either curved or straight, and the valves are\r\narticulated by means of a pair of “hinge-teeth” (Fig. 329, _t_) in the\r\nventral valve, which fit into corresponding sockets in the opposite\r\nvalve. Some genera have the teeth very rudimentary, or have lost them\r\naltogether. The teeth are frequently supported by “dental plates,” and\r\nthe sockets by “socket plates” (_e.g._ _Conchidium_, Figs. 324, 325).\r\nA few genera with a long hinge line have the whole of it denticulated\r\n(_Stropheodonta_). In the dorsal valve medianly close under the hinge\r\nline is a shelly protuberance--the “cardinal process”--to which\r\nthe diductor muscles are attached. It is sometimes of great length\r\nand forked (_Stringocephalus_, Fig. 326), or tripartite, or even\r\nquadripartite; but in _Rhynchonella_ and some other genera it is\r\nrudimentary.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 324.--_Conchidium galeatum._ Wenlock\r\n  Limestone.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 325.--_Conchidium galeatum._ Transverse\r\n  section. _d_, Dorsal valve; _d.s_, dorsal septum; _s_, socket\r\n  plate; _v_, ventral valve; _v.s_, ventral septum; _d.p_, dental\r\n  plate.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 326.--_Stringocephalus Burtini._ (Modified\r\n  from Woodward.)

In those genera that possess it a\r\ntriangular fissure--the “deltidial fissure”--frequently traverses it\r\non both valves; in the dorsal valve the fissure is merely the space\r\nbetween the dental sockets, and may be occupied by the cardinal-\r\nprocess (Fig. 334, C) or covered by a shelly plate--the “chilidium.” In\r\nthe ventral valve it gives passage to the pedicle, and may be partly\r\nor entirely closed by a similar plate (Fig. 334, _d_) known as the\r\n“pseudo-deltidium,” especially large in _Clitambonites_, or remain\r\nopen (_Orthis_). This pseudo-deltidium is a primitive character, and\r\narises in an early stage of the development as a shell-growth on the\r\ndorsal side of the animal, becoming attached to the ventral valve\r\nsubsequently. The pedicle in many genera passes out through a special\r\nforamen in the beak of the ventral valve; and its proximal portion\r\nis often embraced by a pair of small plates--the deltidial plates or\r\n“deltidium”--which are formed on lateral extensions of the ventral\r\nmantle lobe, according to Beecher. These plates lie on each side of the\r\npedicle, or grow round and unite in front of it (_Rhynchonella_, Fig.\r\n327), or constitute merely its anterior border (_Terebratula_, Fig.\r\n328). In some cases this foramen becomes closed in old age.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 327.--_Rhynchonella Boueti._ (Cornbrash.)\r\n  _d_, Deltidium; _f_, foramen.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 328.--_Terebratula sella._ (Lower Greensand.)\r\n  _d_, Deltidium; _f_, foramen.]\r\n\r\nThe dorsal valve in a few cases has its beak perforated by a\r\nforamen--the “visceral foramen.” This foramen is in no way connected\r\nwith the pedicle foramen, but points perhaps to the existence in\r\nthe early Testicardinate genera of an anal aperture. In _Athyris\r\nconcentrica_ (Devonian) this foramen is connected internally with a\r\ncylindrical tube, which extends longitudinally to about one-third the\r\nlength of the valve. In _Centronella_ the aperture in the cardinal\r\nplate is rounded and complete; and in _Strophomena_ and its allies\r\nthe opening lies between the cardinal processes. If this feature is\r\ncorrectly interpreted, it suggests a retrogression of the group since\r\nPalaeozoic times not only in numbers, but in structure; and other\r\nevidence points the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Internal Characters=\r\n\r\nThe interior of the shell is sometimes more or less divided up by\r\nsepta. A median septum occurs in one or both valves of many genera as\r\na low ridge or strongly developed partition (_Waldheimia_, Fig. 329,\r\n_ss_; and Stringocephalus, Fig. 326, B, _v.s_). _Conchidium_ (Fig. 325)\r\nhas its dental plates of great size, and uniting to form a V-shaped\r\nchamber or “spondylium,” supported by a median double septum; and by\r\nmeans of these with a pair of septa and the large socket-plates in the\r\ndorsal valve the interior of the shell of this genus is divided up into\r\nseveral chambers.\r\n\r\nThe interiors of several other genera are somewhat similarly divided up.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 329.--_Waldheimia (Magellania) flavescens._\r\n  =A=, Interior of ventral valve: _a_, adductor scars; _v.a_,\r\n  ventral adjustors; _d_, divaricators; _a.d_, accessory\r\n  divaricators; _p_, peduncular muscle; _dm_, deltidium; _f_,\r\n  foramen; _t_, teeth. =B=, Interior of dorsal valve: _a.a_,\r\n  anterior adductor (occlusor) scars; _a.p_, posterior adductor\r\n  (occlusor) scars; _c.p_, cardinal process; _cr_, crura; _d.s_,\r\n  dental sockets; _hp_, hinge-plate; _l_, brachial loop; _ss_,\r\n  septum. (After Davidson.)]\r\n\r\nIn the Carboniferous genus _Syringothyris_ two special plates, situated\r\nbetween the dental plates, are rolled into an incomplete tube, so as\r\nto enclose probably the anal extremity of the alimentary canal; and\r\nin several genera a sub-umbonal “cardinal plate” is present, which is\r\nperforated (_Athyris_) or slit in some cases for the passage of the\r\nanal tube.\r\n\r\nFor the support of the fleshy “spiral arms” the calcareous structures\r\nforming the “brachial apparatus” are of two main types--(1) the loop\r\ntype; (2) the spiral-cone type. In the _Strophomenidae_ no special\r\ncalcareous support seems to have been usually present (Fig. 334),\r\nthough in some species of _Leptaena_ spirally-grooved elevated areas\r\nsupported the fleshy arms; in the _Productidae_ it is probable that the\r\nridges enclosing the “reniform impressions” (Fig. 333, _i_) served for\r\na similar purpose.\r\n\r\nThe _Terebratulidae_ show the “loop type” of brachial apparatus. In\r\n_Waldheimia_ (Fig. 329), which may be taken as an example, we notice\r\nfirst in the dorsal valve the “crura” (_cr_), from which arise the two\r\n“descending branches” which run forwards and then are bent back to form\r\nthe “ascending branches” which are united by the “transverse band.” In\r\nsome genera the “ascending branches” may be reduced to mere points,\r\nand the “transverse band” become a median vertical plate; the “crura,”\r\ntoo, may be fused so as to form a “crural band”; and the “descending\r\nbranches” may be connected by a cross band--the “jugal band.” In\r\n_Stringocephalus_ (Fig. 326, _l_, _s.p_) the loop is furnished on its\r\ninner edge with radiating processes; and in _Argiope_ the loop is\r\nsimple, not reflected, and fused with marginal septa; while in the\r\n_Thecidiidae_ it is more or less fused with the shell itself, and with\r\nthe mass of calcareous spicules secreted by the mantle.\r\n\r\nThe “spiral-cone type” of brachial apparatus is found in the\r\n_Spiriferidae_, _Atrypidae_, and _Koninckinidae_, and consists of two\r\nspirally-enrolled calcified lamellae, forming two cones with their\r\napices directed laterally (_Spirifera_, Fig. 330), or towards the\r\ninterior of the dorsal valve (_Atrypa_, Fig. 332), or towards each\r\nother (_Glassia_); or forming two flat spirals in the same plane\r\n(_Koninckinidae_). A “jugal band” is generally present, but varies much\r\nin position, and in some genera has complicated posterior processes.\r\n\r\nThe _Rhynchonellidae_ have no loop or spiral cones, but merely a pair\r\nof short “crura.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 330.--_Spirifera striata._ (Carboniferous\r\n  Limestone.) Showing brachial spires.]\r\n\r\nThe principal modifications in the attachments of the muscles in the\r\n_Testicardines_ are illustrated by _Productus giganteus_ (Fig. 333),\r\n_Leptaena rhomboidalis_ (Fig. 334), and _Waldheimia flavescens_ (Fig.\r\n329).\r\n\r\nIn _Productus_ (Fig. 333) we see in the ventral valve a pair of\r\ndendritic occlusor, often called adductor, impressions and a pair of\r\nlarge flabellate divaricator impressions. In the dorsal valve the large\r\n“cardinal process” served for the attachment of the divaricator, and a\r\nlow median septum separated the dendritic occlusor scars, which are\r\nrarely divisible into anterior and posterior pairs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 331.--_Atrypa reticularis._ (Wenlock\r\n  Limestone.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 332.--Interior of the same, seen from the\r\n  dorsal side, showing brachial spires. (After Hall.)]\r\n\r\nIn _Leptaena_ (Fig. 334) the occlusor scars (_a_) in the ventral valve\r\nare narrow and median, and are enclosed by a pair of flabelliform\r\ndivaricator impressions (_d.v_); in the dorsal valve two pairs of\r\nocclusor scars (_a.a_, _p.a_) are well marked, and accessory posterior\r\nocclusor scars are traceable in some specimens. The vascular sinuses\r\n(_v.s_) and genital areas are conspicuous in many species of this and\r\nother genera.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 333.--_Productus giganteus._ (After\r\n  Woodward.)

In the dorsal valve anterior and\r\nposterior pairs of occlusor scars (_a.a_, _a.p_) are visible.\r\n\r\nThe minute structure of the calcareous shell of the Testicardines is\r\nof flattened fibrous prisms inclined at a very acute angle to the\r\nsurfaces. In many forms minute tubes more or less closely arranged\r\npierce through the fibrous shell-substance; but in some genera\r\n(_Productus_) they do not reach the outer surface (see p. 468). Allied\r\ngenera, however, differ much in the punctate or impunctate character of\r\nthe shell.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 334.--_Leptaena rhomboidalis._ (Silurian.)\r\n  =A=, External view of ventral valve. =B=, Interior of ventral\r\n  valve: _a_, occlusor scars; _d_, pseudo-deltidium; _d.v_,\r\n  divaricator scars; _c.a_, hinge area; _t_, teeth. =C=, Interior\r\n  of dorsal valve: _a.a_, anterior occlusor scars; _p.a_, posterior\r\n  occlusor scars; _c.a_, hinge area; _c.p_, cardinal process; _d_,\r\n  chilidium; _s_, dental sockets; _v.s_, vascular sinuses.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSYNOPSIS OF FAMILIES\r\n\r\n\r\n                             I.

Such are _Lingula_, ranging\r\nfrom the Cambrian; _Discina_ and _Crania_, ranging from the Ordovician;\r\nand amongst the hinged forms _Terebratula_ from the Devonian, and\r\n_Rhynchonella_ from the Ordovician.\r\n\r\nIn the lowest Cambrian (Olenellus beds) the most important genera\r\nare _Linnarssonia_ and _Kutorgina_. The hinged forms appear in the\r\nCambrian, being represented by _Orthis_; but the majority in this\r\nformation belong to the Ecardines. _Lingula_, _Lingulella_, and\r\n_Obolella_ are characteristic.\r\n\r\nIn the Ordovician many new genera of the Testicardines make\r\ntheir appearance, such as _Strophomena_, _Leptaena_, _Atrypa_,\r\n_Rhynchonella_, _Clitambonites_, etc., but the extraordinary abundance\r\nand variety of _Orthis_ is most remarkable. The Ecardines are\r\nreinforced by such forms as _Trematis_ and _Siphonotreta_. It is,\r\nhowever, in the Silurian that the Testicardinate Brachiopoda attain\r\ntheir maximum, for in addition to a great development of species\r\namongst the older forms, a host of new genera for the first time occur\r\nhere (_Spirifera_, _Athyris_, _Conchidium_, _Stricklandia_, _Chonetes_,\r\n_Cyrtia_, etc.); and the _Trimerellidae_ are especially characteristic\r\nof the Wenlock.\r\n\r\nWith the commencement of Devonian times many species and genera\r\nbecome extinct, but new forms come in (_Terebratula_, _Orthothetes_,\r\n_Productus_, etc.), and some genera are wholly confined to this\r\nformation (_Uncites_, _Stringocephalus_). The Carboniferous is\r\nmarked by the maximum development of _Productus_ and _Spirifera_;\r\n_Orthothetes_, _Stenochisma_, and _Athyris_ are also abundant, but\r\nthere is a considerable extinction of the older genera and species, and\r\na great diminution in the number of individuals and species of those\r\nthat persist.\r\n\r\nA further reduction occurs in the Permian, where the most important\r\ngenera are _Productus_, _Strophalosia_, and _Stenochisma_; but\r\n_Aulosteges_ is a new form peculiar to this period. In the Trias a new\r\nera commences; the principal families and genera of the older rocks\r\ndisappear entirely; a few spire-bearing genera persist (_Spiriferina_,\r\n_Athyris_), and the genus _Koninckina_ is restricted to this formation.\r\n\r\nThe enormous development of species of the _Terebratulidae_ and\r\n_Rhynchonellidae_ is the most noticeable feature in Jurassic times; and\r\na few ancient types linger on into the Lias (_Spiriferina_, _Suessia_,\r\na sub-genus of _Spirifera_); _Koninckella_ here occurs.\r\n\r\nThe Cretaceous Brachiopoda are closely allied to the Jurassic; _Magas_\r\nand _Lyra_ are peculiar to the period, and the _Terebratulidae_ and\r\n_Rhynchonellidae_ are very abundant, together with the Ecardinate genus\r\n_Crania_.\r\n\r\nWith the commencement of Tertiary times the Brachiopoda have lost their\r\ngeological importance, and have dwindled down into an insignificant\r\nproportion of the whole Invertebrate fauna.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *

of an individual\r\nresemble in important anatomical features the adult individuals of\r\nother species occurring in successive members of a stratigraphical\r\nseries, the development of the individual may be regarded as an epitome\r\nof the development of the species; it also generally throws light on\r\nthe origin and relationships of allied genera and families.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the fossil Brachiopoda comparatively little work has yet\r\nbeen done in tracing their ontogeny or phylogeny, though the abundance,\r\nvariety, and excellent state of preservation of the extinct species\r\noffer a promising field for investigation. It is to Dr. C. E. Beecher\r\nand other recent American palaeontologists that we owe our advance in\r\nthis branch of the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, in about forty genera, representing nearly all the\r\nleading families of the group, the important fact has been established\r\nof the presence of a common form of embryonic shell, termed the\r\n“protegulum,” which is “semicircular or semielliptical in shape with a\r\nstraight or arcuate hinge line and no hinge area” (Beecher).[431] Its\r\nminute size and delicate texture cause its preservation to be rare, but\r\nits impression is not uncommonly left on the beak of the adult shell.\r\n\r\nThe main features of this embryonic shell are exhibited in the adult\r\nLower Cambrian Brachiopod _Obolus_ (_Kutorgina_) _labradoricus_\r\n(Billings); the sub-equal semielliptical valves have lines of growth\r\nrunning concentrically and parallel to the margin of the shell, and\r\nending abruptly against the straight hinge line; and this indicates\r\nthat there has been no change in the outline and proportions of the\r\nshell during its stages of growth, but only a general increase in size.\r\nIt is very significant that we have here a mature type possessing the\r\ncommon embryonic characters of a host of widely separated genera, and\r\nwe may therefore regard it as the most primitive form known.\r\n\r\nMany genera pass through this so-called “Paterina” stage either in\r\nthe case of both their valves, or more generally in the case of the\r\ndorsal valve only; but modifications in the form of the protegulum\r\narise, which are due to the influence of accelerated growth, by\r\nwhich features belonging to later stages become impressed on the\r\nearly embryonic shell. The most variable and specialised valve--the\r\nventral or pedicle valve naturally exhibits the effect of this\r\ninfluence first and to the greatest extent. The Palaeozoic adult forms\r\nof many species represent various pre-adult stages of the Mesozoic,\r\nTertiary, and Recent species, as is especially well shown in the genera\r\n_Orbiculoidea_ and _Discinisca_.\r\n\r\nIn the Strophomenoid shells the protegulum in the dorsal valve is\r\nusually normal, but in the ventral valve abbreviation of the hinge\r\nand curvature of the hinge line are produced by acceleration of the\r\n“Discinoid stage” in which a pedicle notch is present.\r\n\r\nNo marked variation has yet been noticed in the spire-bearing, or\r\nTerebratuloid, or Rhynchonelloid genera.\r\n\r\nThe form of the shell and the amount of difference in shape and size of\r\nthe valves seem to be largely due to the length of the pedicle and its\r\ninclination to the axis of the body, as evidenced by the development\r\nof _Terebratulina_. A series showing progressive dissimilarity of the\r\ntwo valves arising from these causes can be traced from _Lingula_ to\r\n_Crania_. The greater alteration that takes place in the ventral valve\r\nappears to be due to its position as lower and attached valve. If the\r\npedicle is short a transversely-expanded shell with long hinge line\r\nresults when the plane of the valves is vertical or ascending, but\r\nwhen the latter is horizontal a Discinoid form is found. This mode of\r\nattachment is often accompanied by a more or less plainly developed\r\nradial symmetry. Shells with long pedicles, on the other hand, are\r\nusually longer than wide.\r\n\r\nThe character of the pedicle-opening is of great significance from\r\nan evolutional and classificatory point of view, for the successive\r\nstages through which it passes in embryonic growth are chronologically\r\nparalleled by different genera, and are likewise accompanied by the\r\nsuccessive acquisition of other important anatomical characters, as\r\nhas been shown by Beecher and others. The first and simplest type of\r\npedicle opening is in shells with a posterior gaping of the valves,\r\nwhere the pedicle protrudes freely between them in a line with the\r\naxis, and the opening is shared by both valves, though generally\r\nto a greater extent by the ventral valve. _Paterina_ (_= Obolus\r\nlabradoricus_) and _Lingula_ furnish examples of this type. In the\r\nsecond type the pedicle opening is restricted to the ventral valve,\r\nand the direction of the pedicle makes a right angle with the plane\r\nof the valves; in the lower forms the pedicle lies in a slit or sinus\r\n(_Trematidae_), but by further specialisation it becomes enclosed by\r\nshell growth so as to lie within the periphery, and finally becomes\r\nsub-central in some genera (_Discinidae_). The third type shows the\r\npedicle opening confined to the ventral valve and sub-marginal. A\r\npseudo-deltidium may preserve the original opening (_Clitambonites_);\r\nor this shelly plate may become worn away or reabsorbed in the adult\r\nso that the deltidial fissure through which the pedicle passes remains\r\nquite open (_Orthidae_). In the fourth type the incipient stage marks\r\na return to the simple conditions of the first type; but ultimately\r\na pair of deltidial plates develop, and may completely limit the\r\npedicle opening below. Examples of this type are _Spirifera_ and\r\n_Rhynchonella_. By means of these four types the Brachiopods have been\r\ndivided into four Orders: the _Atremata_ (type i.); the _Neotremata_\r\n(type ii.); the _Protremata_ (type iii.); and the _Telotremata_ (type\r\niv.).\r\n\r\nThe _Telotremata_ were the last to appear, but the four types of\r\npedicle-opening with the various forms of calcareous brachial apparatus\r\nwere in existence in the Bala period of the Ordovician.\r\n\r\nAs _Paterina_ is the most primitive form of all, we may place it at\r\nthe root of the phylogenetic tree. From it sprang the _Atremata_,\r\nwhich gave off the _Neotremata_ and _Protremata_; the most primitive\r\n_Neotremata_ seem to be the _Trematidae_, while the connecting\r\nlink between the _Protremata_ and _Atremata_ is furnished by the\r\n_Kutorginidae_. From the genus _Conchidium_ and its allies we may see\r\nhow the _Rhynchonellidae_ ushered in the _Telotremata_ as an offshoot\r\nfrom the _Protremata_. The _Telotremata_ subsequently gave off two\r\nmain branches, which became specialised with the loop-bearing and\r\nspire-bearing forms respectively.\r\n\r\nThe evolution and mutual relationships of genera have been indicated\r\nwith much probability by Hall, Clarke, and others. The Obolelloid\r\ntype may be connected with the Linguloid by means of _Lingulella_\r\nand _Linyulepis_, while in _Lingula_ itself we find the point of\r\ndivergence for the ancestors of _Trimerella_, and for a line of\r\nvariation culminating in _Dignomia_. The Palaeozoic Rhynchonelloids\r\nbranched off at an early period from the same stock as _Orthis_, and\r\nare connecting links between this genus and Mesozoic Rhynchonellae;\r\nand a whole series of genera exhibit intermediate stages of structure\r\nbetween the Rhynchonelloid and Pentameroid groups. The Terebratuloids\r\ncan be traced back to the primitive type _Renssoellaria_; and amongst\r\nspire-bearing forms, the protean genus _Spirifera_ can be split up into\r\ngroups of species which diverge along lines tending to forms no longer\r\ncongeneric. When we come to deal with specific differences we find\r\nfrequently such a host of intermediate varieties that the separation of\r\nmany species, as in the case of Mesozoic Terebratulae, is to a large\r\nextent arbitrary and artificial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n    References to figures are printed in thick type (=248=, =197=);\r\n           to

Zool. Soc._ x. p. 485. Rücker has observed (_Ber.\r\nOberhess. Gesell. Nat. Heilk._ xxii. p. 207) that the radula in\r\n_Helix pomatia_ is the product of five rows of cells; the use\r\nof the first row is uncertain, the second forms the membrane of the\r\nradula, while rows three to five originate the teeth.\r\n\r\n[321] _Jahrb. Deut. Malak. Gesell._ iii. p. 193.\r\n\r\n[322] The whole of the radulae and jaws figured in this work are\r\ntaken from the original specimens in the collection of the Rev. Prof.\r\nH. M. Gwatkin, who has always been ready to give me the run of his\r\ncabinets, which probably contain the finest series of radulae in the\r\nworld. To his kindness I owe the following description of the process\r\nof mounting: “The first step is to obtain the radula. Dissection is\r\neasy in species of a reasonable size. On opening the head from above,\r\nso as to lay open the floor of the mouth, the radula itself is seen in\r\nmost of the marine species, though in others it is contained in a sort\r\nof proboscis; and in the Pulmonata and others the student will find\r\nthe buccal mass, with commonly a brown mandible at its front end, and\r\nthe lingual ribbon in its hinder part. The teeth may be recognised by\r\ntheir silvery whiteness, except in a few cases like _Patella_ and\r\n_Chiton_, where they are of a deep brown colour. When obtained,\r\nthe radula may be cleaned by boiling in a solution of caustic potash.\r\nThere is no risk of injury if the solution is not too strong.\r\n\r\n“Smaller species may be treated more summarily. The proboscis, the\r\nbuccal mass, or even the whole animal may be thrown into the potash\r\nsolution and boiled till scarcely anything is left but the cleaned\r\nradula. Remains of animals dried inside the shell may be similarly\r\ndealt with, after soaking in clean water. With a little care, this\r\nprocess will answer for shells down to the size of _Ancylus_ or\r\n_Rissoa_. The very smallest (_Carychium_, _Tornatellina_, _Skenea_,\r\netc.) must be crushed on the slide and boiled on it, after removing as\r\nmuch as possible of the broken shell. The radula can then be searched\r\nfor under the microscope, and washed and mounted on the slide.\r\n\r\n“The student must be warned that though the general process is simple,\r\nthere are difficulties in particular cases. In the Pulmonata, for\r\nexample, membranes on both sides of the radula need careful removal.\r\n_Murex_, _Purpura_, and most of the _Taenioglossa_ have the side teeth\r\nfolded down over the central, so that the arrangement is not well seen\r\ntill they have been brushed back. The Cones, again, have no basal\r\nmembrane at all, so that if the potash is not used with great care,\r\nthe single teeth will fall asunder and be lost. Perhaps the worst case\r\nis where a large animal has a radula as small as that of a _Rissoa_,\r\nlike _Turritella_, _Harpa_, or _Struthiolaria_, or where the radula is\r\nalmost filmy in its transparency, like those of _Actaeon_ and the small\r\n_Scalaria_.\r\n\r\n“When once the radula is laid out, the mounting is commonly easy.\r\nCanada balsam makes it too transparent. Fluids may be used, and are\r\nalmost necessary for thick radulae like those of large _Chitons_;\r\nbut the best general medium is glycerine jelly. It runs under the\r\ncover glass by capillary attraction, and may be boiled (though only\r\nfor a moment) to get rid of air bubbles. It should then be left\r\nunfinished for several weeks. If cracks appear, the reason is either\r\nthat the jelly is a bad sample, or that it has been boiled too long,\r\nor (commonly) that the object is too thick; and there is not often\r\nany difficulty in remounting. I have no serious complaint of want\r\nof permanence against the medium, if I may speak from a pretty wide\r\nexperience during the last twenty years.”\r\n\r\n[323] The substance both of the jaw and radula is neither crystalline\r\nnor cellular, but laminated. Chitin is the substance which forms\r\nthe ligament in bivalves, the ‘pen’ in certain Cephalopoda, and the\r\noperculum in many univalves. Neither silica nor keratine enter into the\r\ncomposition of the radula.\r\n\r\n[324] τόξον, arrow; ῥάχις, ridge, sharp edge; ταινία, ribbon; πτηνός,\r\nwinged; γυμνὀς, bare; ῥιπίς, fan; δοκός, beam.\r\n\r\n[325] _V. concinna_, according to Schacko (_Conch. Mitth._ i.\r\np. 126, Pl. xxiv. f. 5); the lateral is large, strong, unicuspid on a\r\nbroad base.\r\n\r\n[326] In some cases (_e.g._ _Hyalinia inornata_) the laterals\r\nare very few, while in _Zonites laevigatus_ the first side tooth\r\nis more of a marginal than a lateral.\r\n\r\n[327] Semon, _Biol. Centralbl._ ix. p. 80.\r\n\r\n[328] According to Moquin-Tandon (_Moll. de France_, i. p. 44)\r\nthis process in _Bithynia_ is attached by one end to the wall of\r\nthe stomach. _Vivipara_, with two jaw pieces, does not possess\r\nthis stylet; _Bithynia_, which does possess it, has no jaw.\r\n\r\n[329] J.

Twenty-one species are “introduced.”\r\n\r\n[375] Nine species have been introduced: 6 from Europe, 2 from the West\r\nIndies, 1 from the Western Isles.\r\n\r\n[376] It is by no means implied that _unbroken_ land communication\r\nbetween India and Madagascar, across the Indian Ocean, ever existed.\r\nA series of great islands, whose remains are attested by the Chagos\r\nand other banks, would be quite sufficient to account for the results,\r\nas we find them. See especially Medlicott and Blanford, _Geology of\r\nIndia_, vol. i. p. lxviii.\r\n\r\n[377] _Journ. Cinc. Soc. Nat. Hist._ iii. p. 317. The number is\r\ndoubtless susceptible of very considerable reduction, say by one-half\r\nat least.\r\n\r\n[378] Simpson, _Amer. Nat._ xxvii. 1893, p. 354.\r\n\r\n[379] Compare von Martens, _Malak. Blätt._ 1868, p. 169; von\r\nIhering, _Nachr. Deutsch. Malak. Gesell._ 1891, p. 93.\r\n\r\n[380] The distribution of some Pteropoda has been worked out by Munthe,\r\n_Bih. Svensk. Ak. Handl._ XII. iv. 2, by Pelseneer _“Challenger”\r\nRep._, Zool. xxiii., and by Boas, _Spolia Atlantica_.\r\n\r\n[381] _Bull. Mus. C. Z. Harv._ xiv. p. 202; xxiii. p. 34 f.\r\n\r\n[382] See papers in _P. Z. S._ 1878–85.\r\n\r\n[383] A break in this uniformity may be found underneath the course\r\nof a great oceanic current like the Gulf Stream, which rains upon\r\nthe bottom a large amount of food. A. Agassiz (_Bull. Mus. C. Z.\r\nHarv._ xxi. p. 185 f.) explains in this way the richness of the\r\nfauna of the Gulf of Mexico as compared with that of the west coast of\r\ntropical America.\r\n\r\n[384] On the western coasts of Europe and America, where the change\r\nin surface temperature is very gradual, _Purpura lapillus_ (the\r\nwest American ‘species’ are at best only derivatives) is able to creep\r\nas far south as lat. 32° (Mogador) in the former case, and lat. 24°\r\n(Margarita Bay) in the latter, the mean annual temperature of the\r\nsurface water being 66° off Mogador, with an extreme range of only 8°,\r\nand that of Margarita Bay 73°, with an extreme range of only 5°. On\r\nthe eastern coasts, where the Pacific and Atlantic gulf-streams cause\r\na sudden change of temperature, the _Purpura_ is barred back at\r\npoints many degrees farther north, _viz._ at lat. 41° (Hakodadi),\r\nsurface temperature 52°, extreme range 25°; and at lat. 42° (Newhaven),\r\nsurface temperature 52°, extreme range 30°.\r\n\r\n[385] E. A. Smith, _P. Z. S._ 1890, pp. 247, 317.\r\n\r\n[386] A. H. Cook, _Ann. Mag. Nat. Hist._ (5) xviii. (1886) p. 380\r\nf; E. A. Smith, _P. Z. S._ 1891, p. 391 f.\r\n\r\n[387] C. Keller, _Neue denksch. Schw. Gesell._ xxviii. 1883, pt. 3.\r\n\r\n[388] According to Tate (_Trans. Roy. Soc. S. Austr._ 1887–88,\r\np. 70), ‘Australian’ species predominate at Freemantle (32°), but\r\nTenison-Woods (_J. Roy. Soc. N. S. Wales_, xxii. p. 106) holds\r\nthat the tropical fauna extends as far south as Cape Leeuwin (34°), and\r\nthat the Australian forms are not predominant until the extreme south.\r\nTenison-Woods regards Cape Byron (31°) as the limit of the tropical\r\nfauna on the east coast, while some characteristic tropical genera\r\nreach Port Jackson, and a few (_e.g._ _Cypraea annulus_)\r\nTasmania.\r\n\r\n[389] A full account of the distribution of _Voluta_ is given by\r\nCrosse, _Journ. de Conchyl._ (3) xix. p. 263.\r\n\r\n[390] Usually known as ‘Patagonian,’ but since the Magellanic\r\nSub-region includes a considerable part of Patagonia, and since the\r\ngreater part of sub-region (6) lies out of Patagonia, it has been\r\nthought advisable to change the name.\r\n\r\n[391] _Amer. Nat._ xx. p. 931.\r\n\r\n[392] W. H. Dall, _Proc. Biol. Soc. Washington_, v. p. 1 f.\r\n\r\n[393] _Trans. Connect. Acad._ v. p. 177; _Zoologist_, 1875,\r\np. 4502.\r\n\r\n[394] _Rep.

Fossil Cephal.\r\nBrit. Mus._, 1888.\r\n\r\n[402] Saville Kent, _Proc. Roy. Soc. Queensland_, vi. p. 229.\r\n\r\n[403] J. Power, _Ann. Mag. N. H_. (2) xx. p. 334; _P. Z. S._\r\n1836, p. 113; _Arch.

It may be doubted whether\r\nthat position will stand the test of further investigation, and\r\nwhether the families concerned will not be added to the Cladohepatic\r\nNudibranchs.\r\n\r\n[405] This family has also been classified with the Bulloidea and with\r\nthe Aplysioidea.\r\n\r\n[406] It appears more convenient to treat the whole group together,\r\nrather than deal with the two sections separately.\r\n\r\n[407] An operculum is said to exist in the young forms of\r\n_Auricula_ and _Parmacella_.\r\n\r\n[408] _Proc.

The lateral muscles enable the\r\nvalves to move backwards and forwards on each other; the centrals close\r\nthe shell; the umbonals open it; and the transmedians allow a sliding\r\nsideways movement of one valve across the other (see also p. 477).\r\n\r\n[430] Davidson and King, _Quart.
