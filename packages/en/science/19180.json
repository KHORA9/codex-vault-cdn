Fairbairn, Dr. Joule, and Mr.\r\nSpence, which at once put an entirely new complexion on the matter.\r\n\r\nDr. Joule says:\r\n\r\n\"As is usual in a severe frost, we have recently heard of many severe\r\naccidents consequent upon the fracture of the tires of the wheels of\r\nrailway carriages. The common-sense explanation of these accidents is,\r\nthat the ground being harder than usual, the metal with which it\r\nis brought into contact is more severely tried than in ordinary\r\ncircumstances. In order apparently to excuse certain railway\r\ncompanies, a pretence has been set up that iron and steel become\r\nbrittle at a low temperature. This pretence, although put forth in\r\ndefiance, not only of all we know, of the properties of materials, but\r\nalso of the experience of everyday life, has yet obtained the credence\r\nof so many people that I thought it would be useful to make the\r\nfollowing simple experiments:\r\n\r\n\"1st. A freezing mixture of salt and snow was placed on a table. Wires\r\nof steel and of iron were stretched, so that a part of them was in\r\ncontact with the freezing mixture and another part out of it. In every\r\ncase I tried the wire broke outside of the mixture, showing that it\r\nwas weaker at 50 deg. F., than at about 12 deg. F.\r\n\r\n\"2d. I took twelve darning needles of good quality, 3 in. long, 1/24\r\nin. thick. The ends of these were placed against steel props, 2-1/8\r\nin. asunder. In making an experiment, a wire was fastened to\r\nthe middle of a needle, the other end being attached to a spring\r\nweighing-machine. This was then pulled until the needle gave way. Six\r\nof the needles, taken at random, were tried at a temperature of 55 deg.\r\nF., and the remaining six in a freezing mixture which brought down\r\ntheir temperature to 12 deg. F. The results were as follow:--\r\n\r\n        Warm Needles.          Cold Needles.\r\n         64 ounces broke        55 ounces broke\r\n         65   \"      \"          64   \"      \"\r\n         55   \"      \"          72   \"      \"\r\n         62   \"      \"          60   \"    bent\r\n         44   \"      \"          68   \"    broke\r\n         60   \"    bent         40   \"      \"\r\n         ---                    ---\r\nAverage, 58-1/3        Average, 59-5/6\r\n\r\n\"I did not notice any perceptible difference in the perfection of\r\nelasticity in the two sets of needles. The result, as far as it goes,\r\nis in favor of the cold metal.\r\n\r\n\"3d. The above are doubtless decisive of the question at issue. But\r\nas it might be alleged that the violence to which a railway wheel is\r\nsubjected is more akin to a blow than a steady pull; and as, moreover,\r\nthe pretended brittleness is attributed more to cast iron than any\r\nother description of the metal, I have made yet another kind of\r\nexperiment. I got a quantity of cast iron garden nails, an inch and\r\na quarter long and 1/8 in. thick in the middle. These I weighed,\r\nand selected such as were nearly of the same weight. I then arranged\r\nmatters so that by removing a prop I could cause the blunt edge of a\r\nsteel chisel weighted to 4lb. 2oz., to fall from a given height upon\r\nthe middle of the nail as it was supported from each end, 1-1/16 in.\r\nasunder. In order to secure the absolute fairness of the trials, the\r\nnails were taken at random, and an experiment with a cold nail was\r\nalways alternated with one at the ordinary temperature. The nails to\r\nbe cooled were placed in a mixture of salt and snow, from which they\r\nwere removed and struck with the hammer in less than 5\".\"\r\n\r\nThe collective result of the experiments, the details of which need\r\nnot be given, was that 21 cold nails broke and 20 warm ones.\r\n\r\nDr. Joule adds, \"The experiments of Lavoisier and Laplace, of Smeaton,\r\nof Dulong and Petit, and of Troughton, conspire in giving a less\r\nexpansion by heat to steel than iron, especially if the former be in\r\nan untempered state; but this, would in certain limits have the effect\r\nof strengthening rather than of weakening an iron wheel with a tire of\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\n\"The general conclusion is this: Frost does _not_ make either iron\r\n(cast or wrought), or steel, brittle.\r\n\r\nMr. Spence, in his experiments, decided on having some lengths of\r\ncast iron made of a uniform thickness of 1/2 in. square, from the same\r\nmetal and the same mould.\r\n\r\nHe writes:--\"Two of the four castings I got seemed to be good ones,\r\nand I got the surface taken off, and made them as regular a thickness\r\nas was practicable.\r\n\r\n\"I then fixed two knife-edged wedges upon the surface of a plank, at\r\nexactly nine inches distance from each other, with an opening in the\r\nplank in the intervening space, the bar being laid across the wedges,\r\na knife-edged hook was hung in the middle of the suspended piece of\r\nthe bar, and to the hook was hung a large scale on which to place\r\nweights.\r\n\r\n\"The bar was tried first at a temperature of 60 deg. F.; to find the\r\nbreaking weight I placed 56lb. weights one after another on the scale,\r\nand when the ninth was put on the bar snapped. This was the only\r\nunsatisfactory experiment, as 14 or 28lb. might have done it, but I\r\ninclude it among others. I now adopted another precaution, by placing\r\nthe one end of the plank on a fixed point and the other end on to a\r\nscrew-jack, by raising which I could, without any vibration, bring the\r\nweight to bear upon the bar. By this means, small weights up to 7lb.\r\ncould be put on while hanging, but when these had to be taken off and\r\na large weight put on, the scale was lowered to the rest, and again\r\nraised after the change was made. I may here state that a curious\r\ncircumstance occurred twice, which seems to indicate that mere raising\r\nof the weight, without the slightest apparent vibration, was equal in\r\neffect to an additional weight. 33/4 cwts. were on the scale, a 14lb.\r\nweight was added, then 7lb., then 4lb., 2lb., 1lb., and 1lb., making\r\n4cwts. and 1lb. This was allowed to act for from one to two minutes,\r\nand then lowered to take off the small weights, which were replaced by\r\na 56lb. with the intention of adding small weights when suspended; the\r\nwhole was then raised so imperceptibly by the screw, that the only way\r\nof ascertaining that it was suspended, was by looking under the scale\r\nto see that it was clear of the rest. As soon as it was half-an-inch\r\nclear it snapped, thus breaking at once with one pound less than it\r\nresisted for nearly two minutes.\r\n\r\n\"Six experiments were carefully conducted at 60 deg. F., the parts of the\r\nbars being selected so as to give to each set of experiments similar\r\nportions of both bars; the results are marked on the pieces. My\r\nassistant now prepared a refrigerating mixture which stood at zero,\r\nthe bars were immersed for some time in this, and we prepared for the\r\nbreaking trials to be made as quickly as could be, consistently with\r\naccuracy; and to secure the low temperature, each bar, on being placed\r\nin the machine, had its surface at top covered with the freezing\r\nmixture. The bars at zero broke with more regularity than at 60 deg., but\r\ninstead of the results confirming the general impression as to cold\r\nrendering iron more brittle, they are calculated to substantiate\r\nan exactly opposite idea, namely, that reduction of temperature,\r\n_caeteris paribus_, increases the strength of cast iron. The only\r\ndoubtful experiment of the whole twelve is the first, and as it stands\r\nmuch the highest, the probability is that it should be lower; yet,\r\neven taking it as it stands, the average of the six experiments at\r\n60 deg. F., gives 4cwt. 4lb. as the breaking weight of the bar at that\r\ntemperature, while the average of the six experiments at zero gives\r\n4cwt 20lb. as the breaking weight of the bar at zero, being an\r\nincrease of strength, from the reduction of temperature, equal to 3.5\r\nper cent.\"\r\n\r\nSir W. Fairbairn states: \"It has been asserted, in evidence given at\r\nthe coroner's inquest, in a recent railway accident, that the breaking\r\nof the steel tire was occasioned by the intensity of the frost, which\r\nis supposed to have rendered the metal, of which this particular\r\ntire was composed, brittle. This is the opinion of most persons, but\r\njudging from my own experience such is not the fact. Some years since\r\nI endeavored to settle this question by a long and careful series\r\nof experiments on wrought iron, from which it was proved that the\r\nresistance to a tensile chain was as great at the temperature of zero\r\nas it was at 60 deg. or upwards, until it attained a scarcely visible red\r\nheat.\"\r\n\r\nThe immense number of purposes to which both iron and steel are\r\napplied, and the changes of temperature to which they are exposed,\r\nrenders the inquiry not only interesting in a scientific point of\r\nview, but absolutely necessary to a knowledge of their security under\r\nthe various influences of those changes. It was for these reasons\r\nthat the experiments in question were undertaken, and the summary of\r\nresults is sufficiently conclusive to show that changes of temperature\r\nare not always the cause of failure. Sir W. Fairbairn adds: \"The\r\ndanger arising from broken tires does not, according to my opinion,\r\narise so much from changes of temperature as from the practice of\r\nheating them to a dull red heat, and shrinking them on to the rim of\r\nthe wheels. This, I believe, is the general practice, and the unequal,\r\nand in some cases, the severe strains to which they are subject, has a\r\ndirect tendency to break the tires.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOAK GRAINING IN OIL COLORS.\r\n\r\nCONDENSED FROM THE BUILDING NEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a charm and feeling about work executed by the hand, which\r\ngives it a value no mere machine work can possess. Machine work, from\r\nits very nature, necessitates a repetition of pattern, which cannot\r\nbe avoided. Hand-work, on the contrary, can imitate every variety, and\r\nfollow nature so closely that no two pieces need be alike. There\r\nis also in hand-work a wide scope for the inventive faculty and\r\nthe exercise of good taste (both in form and color) and skillful\r\nworkmanship. As a rule, strong contrasts between the ground and the\r\ngraining color should be avoided. The figure and grain should of\r\ncourse be seen clearly, but only so clearly as to be distinct, without\r\ninterfering with the general and uniform quietness of tone necessary\r\nto fulfil the conditions required by the laws of harmony and good\r\ntaste. Violent contrasts and gaudy coloring are always vulgar,\r\nbrilliancy and richness of color are not necessarily vulgar; it is\r\nthe absence of the guiding power of knowledge and pure taste in their\r\narrangement which degrades them to the rank of vulgarity. We have\r\nbefore spoken of the importance of good combing, and of the various\r\nkinds of combs used; we now proceed to describe how the work is done.\r\nThe graining color is brushed over the work, in the ordinary manner,\r\nwith a pound-brush, care being taken not to put too much color on,\r\nor else it is very liable to be dirty. A dry duster is now used to\r\nstipple with, which, if properly done, will distribute the color\r\nevenly; it is now ready for combing. In the real oak it will be found,\r\nas a rule, that the grain is invariably coarser on one side of the\r\npanel than on the other; this arises from the very nature of the\r\ngrowth of the tree; it is, therefore, well to imitate this\r\npattern, and in order to do so we take first a medium or coarse cut\r\ngutta-percha comb, and draw it down one side of the panel; then use a\r\nfiner one to complete it. This comb will leave the marks of the grain\r\nin clear unbroken lines from top to bottom of the panel. We now take a\r\nfine steel comb and go over the whole of the previous combing, moving\r\nit in a slanting or diagonal direction across the previous grain, or\r\nwith a quick and short wavy motion or curl; both the former and the\r\nlatter motion will break up the long lines, left by the gutta-percha\r\ncomb, into short bits, which of course represent the pores or grains\r\nof the real wood. There are several other motions of the comb having\r\nthe same end in view; and by using the gutta-percha or cork combs, in\r\nconjunction with the fine steel, an infinite variety of grain may be\r\nproduced. Steel combs, with one or more folds of thin rag placed\r\nover the ends of the teeth are a style of comb which has nothing to\r\nrecommend it. A natural variation in the grain may be produced by one\r\ncomb alone, according to the manner in which it is held. For instance,\r\nif we take a coarse or broad-toothed gutta-percha comb, and commence\r\nat the top of a panel, with the comb, placed at its full width: if\r\ndrawn down in this position it will leave a grain of the same width\r\nas the width of the teeth: but if we start with the full width, and\r\ngradually turn the comb or slightly incline it to one side--that is to\r\nsay, on its edge, we thereby graduate the grain from coarse to fine\r\nat pleasure, and by holding the comb at a certain inclination we may\r\nactually make very fine the coarse comb. A very important point is\r\nthe formation of the joints in the wood, as much of the effect of\r\notherwise good work is lost in consequence of neglect in this respect.\r\nIn looking at a real oak door, the joints of the stiles and rails are\r\nclearly and sharply defined, not by any defect of workmanship, but\r\nby the difference in the run of the grain, the stiles being\r\nperpendicular, and the rails horizontal. The rails being cut sharp\r\noff by the stiles, show a perfectly straight line. The light also acts\r\ndifferently upon the two, simply because the grain or fibre of the\r\nwood is exposed to its influence under different aspects. This also\r\ntends to produce a difference in the depth of the color of rails and\r\nstiles, and panels also. It will be evident that no imitations can be\r\nconsidered really good except they include these seemingly unimportant\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nIt is a common practice for grainers to imitate a broad piece of heart\r\nor sap of oak, upon the back rail of almost every door they do, and\r\nmany of them are not even content with that, but daub the stiles over\r\nfrom top to bottom with it also. There is nothing so vulgar or in\r\nsuch bad taste. It should only be done upon those parts of the work on\r\nwhich it would appear on a real oak door, namely, on the edges of the\r\ndoors and on mouldings. There is a vulgar pretentiousness about what\r\nwe may call the sappy style of work which is very undesirable. The\r\nfigures cross the grain more or less abruptly and of course are of\r\ndifferent shapes, sizes, and forms, a knowledge of which can only be\r\nacquired by study of the real wood. The figure may be wiped out with\r\na piece of soft rag, held tight over the thumb nail. This should have\r\ntwo or three folds over the nail, the superfluous rag being held by\r\nthe other hand to prevent it hanging down and smearing the grain; and\r\nevery time a figure is wiped, the rag should be moved slightly, so\r\nthat the same part of the rag will not be used twice, thus insuring\r\nclean work. It will often happen that the thumb-nail will get broken,\r\nor is too weak to stand the work; in these cases, or, in fact, in\r\nany case, a good substitute or artificial thumb-nail may be made of\r\ngutta-percha, thus: A piece of thin sheet gutta-percha is put into\r\nwarm water, and, while soft, is wrapped around the end of the thumb up\r\nto the first joint. It is then pressed with the hand, so as to fit\r\nand take the shape of the thumb and nail. This cannot be done at one\r\nheating, but will have to be put into the hot water again, and the end\r\npinched and squeezed into form to the shape of the nail, and to fit\r\neasily upon the thumb. When this gets hard, it may be trimmed into\r\nperfect form with a penknife. This artificial nail will answer the\r\npurpose admirably if properly made; and even when the natural nail\r\nis good, the gutta-percha will serve to save it from injury. Good\r\nfiguring may also be done by using the blank end of the steel\r\ncomb with a rag folded over its edge. We have also used a piece of\r\ngutta-percha to take out the lights. This should be square-ended,\r\nabout one inch wide, and three or four inches long, and will do\r\nsuccessful work of a certain class, but not of the best. Many grainers\r\nuse a piece of thin horn, in shape something like a spatula, about\r\nthree or four inches long and three quarters of an inch wide, with\r\nrounded ends, and quite flexible. With this tool the figure is cut\r\nor scooped out--a sort of quick, side-long motion, very difficult to\r\ndescribe, and requiring a very considerable amount of practice\r\nbefore it can be worked with any success. There is, however, the same\r\nobjection to this tool as may be urged against the gutta-percha for\r\nfiguring, namely, that neither of them take the color clean away, but\r\nleave an accumulation of color on the edge of the figure, which is\r\nfatal to good work; and therefore we cannot honestly recommend the\r\nuse of any method but the wiping out with the thumb-nail or its\r\nsubstitute. When the figure is wiped out it will require to be\r\nsoftened. By softening, we mean the imitation of those half shades\r\nseen upon and about the figures in the real wood. Between and around\r\nthe lights or figure in oak, there is always a lighter tint of color;\r\nthis is imitated by doubling a piece of rag into a small roll, and\r\nwith the side of this the grain is partially wiped away, but not to\r\nthe extent of taking off the whole of the grain. A recent but most\r\nadmirable system of graining oak, by means of over-combing, is worked\r\nexactly the reverse of any of the foregoing methods; that is to\r\nsay, the figure is first wiped out, and the combing or grain is done\r\nafterwards, when the graining color is dry, in this wise: The graining\r\ncolor is mixed somewhat thinner than for ordinary graining, and is\r\nbrushed over the work sparingly, leaving it just sufficiently strong\r\nto show a clear distinction between the ground and the color. The\r\nlight or figure is then softened by drawing the end of a flat hog-hair\r\nfitch, or a small thin mottler, across each figure, and slightly\r\nsoftening with the badger-hair softener. The figure is broken up a\r\nlittle with fine lines across it in parts, such as may be seen in the\r\nreal wood; but previous to wiping out the figure, streaks of light\r\nshould be wiped out and softened on one side of the panel or across\r\nthe stiles, in imitation of the reflective lights seen in oak. The\r\ncolor should also be partially wiped off the rails or stiles at their\r\njunction; this tends to define the joint. The color is now let to\r\ndry hard, when it will be ready for over-combing--that is, combing or\r\ngraining over the figure (hence its name), and this will have to be\r\ndone somewhat differently to the ordinary combing. As thus: The color\r\nis rubbed in as before, and combed solely with the gutta-percha combs,\r\nbut these are specially cut for the purpose; they are best about 2 in.\r\nwide. The first must be cut with teeth about three-sixteenths of an\r\ninch in width, the next one-eighth, and the third about one-sixteenth.\r\nThe broad-toothed comb is first used, and must be drawn down the\r\npanel, with a wavy motion, in short or long curls; either will\r\nanswer our purpose now. The next size of comb is then drawn straight\r\ndown--the straighter the better. This has the effect of breaking the\r\nwavy combing into short and long straight bits, similar to the pores\r\nor grain of the real wood. Both the first and second combing may be\r\nvaried by holding the comb in a slanting direction, and may be fine or\r\ncoarse, according to the width of the combs used; now take a soft rag\r\nfolded, and with this partially clear off the grain which runs over\r\nthe figure, leaving only a sufficient quantity crossing the light\r\nor figure, to be just distinguished, exactly as it appears upon the\r\nfigure in real oak. The grain is also wiped off in parts on the plain\r\nspaces between the figure, in order to break it up and take away any\r\nformality. If this method be well and probably done, a thoroughly\r\ndeceptive imitation may be produced; and except this end be kept in\r\nview, no really good work will result.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOTS AND SPLICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[_SEE ENGRAVING ON FIRST PAGE._]\r\n\r\n1. Turn used in making up ropes.\r\n\r\n2. End tapered for the purpose of passing it readily through a loop.\r\nTo make this, we unlay the rope for the necessary length, reducing\r\na rope diminishing in diameter towards the end, which is finished\r\nby interlacing the ends without cutting them, as it would weaken the\r\nwork; it is lastly \"whipped\" with small twine.\r\n\r\n3. Tapered end, covered with interlaced cordage for the purpose of\r\nmaking it stronger. This is done with very small twine attached at\r\none end to the small eye, and at the other to the strands of the rope,\r\nthus making a strong \"webbing\" around the end.\r\n\r\n4. Double turn used for making rope.\r\n\r\n5. Eye splice. The strands of the cable are brought back over\r\nthemselves, and interlaced with their original turns, as in a splice.\r\n\r\n6. Tie for the end of a four-strand rope.\r\n\r\n7. The same completed; the strands are tied together, forming loops,\r\nlaying one over the other.\r\n\r\n8. Commencement for making the end by interlacing the strands.\r\n\r\n9. Interlacing complete, but not fastened.\r\n\r\n10 and 11. Shell in two views used in No. 65, showing the disposition\r\nof it at the throat. This joining is advantageous, as it does not\r\nstrain the cords, and it prevents them from cutting each other; so\r\nthat the rings pass one into the other and are joined outside the\r\nintermediate shell.\r\n\r\n12. Interlacing in two directions.\r\n\r\n13. Mode of finishing the end by several turns of the twine continued\r\nover the cable.\r\n\r\n14. Interlacing commenced, in one direction.\r\n\r\n15. Interlacing finished, the ends being worked under the strands, as\r\nin a splice.\r\n\r\n16. Pigtail commenced.\r\n\r\n17. Interlacing fastened.\r\n\r\n18. Pigtail with the strands taut.\r\n\r\n19. Dead eye, shown in two views.\r\n\r\n20. Pigtail finished. We pass the ends of the strands, one under the\r\nother, in the same way as if we were making a pudding splice: thus\r\nbringing it in a line with the rope, to which it is seized fast, and\r\nthe ends cut off.\r\n\r\n21. Scull pigtail; instead of holding the ends by a tie, we interlace\r\nthem again, as in No. 16, the one under the other.\r\n\r\n22. Pigtail, or \"lark's nest.\" We make this to the \"pennant\" of a\r\ncable, which has several strands, by taking the requisite number of\r\nturns over the pudding, in such a manner that the strands shall lay\r\nunder each other. This \"pigtail\" forms a knot at the end of the\r\nrope. It thus draws together two ropes, as shown in No. 32, forming a\r\n\"shroud\" knot. In these two pigtails, the strands are crossed before\r\nfinishing the ends, so that the button, a, is made with the strands,\r\na, and b, with those of the rope, b.\r\n\r\n23. Slip clinch to sailors' knot.\r\n\r\n24. Slip clinch, secured.\r\n\r\n25. Ordinary knot upon a double rope.\r\n\r\n26. Bowline knot for a man to sit in at his work.\r\n\r\n27. Called a \"short splice,\" as it is not of great length, and\r\nbesides, can be made quickly.\r\n\r\n30. Long splice. This extends from a to b. We unlay the strands of\r\neach of the ropes we intend to join, for about half the length that\r\nthe splice will be, putting each strand of the one between two strands\r\nof the other.\r\n\r\n31. Simple fastening on a rope.\r\n\r\n32. A \"shroud\" knot.\r\n\r\n33. The ends of the rope are prepared for making the splice (No.\r\n29) in the same manner as for the \"shroud\" knot in No. 32. When the\r\nstrands are untwisted, we put the ends of two cords together as close\r\nas possible, and place the ends of the one between the strands of the\r\nother, above and below alternately, so as to interlace them as in No.\r\n29. This splice is not, however, very strong, and is only used when\r\nthere is not time to make a long splice, which is much the best.\r\n\r\n34 and 35. Marline spikes. Tools made of wood or iron, used to open\r\nout a rope to pass the strands of another through it.\r\n\r\n36. Shows strands arranged as described in No. 30.\r\n\r\n37. Fastening when a lever is used, and is employed when hauling upon\r\nlarge ropes, where the strength of several men are necessary.\r\n\r\n38. A \"pudding splice.\" This is commenced, like the others, by placing\r\nthe rope end to end, the turns of the one being passed between those\r\nof the other; having first swelled out the yarns by a \"rat's-tail,\" we\r\nput them, two by two, one over the other, twisting them tightly, and\r\nopening a way for them with the marlinspike. The inconvenience of this\r\nsplice is, that it is larger in diameter than the rope itself; but\r\nwhen made sufficiently long, by gradually reducing the size of the\r\nstrands, it has great strength.\r\n\r\n39. This shows two strands, a and b, of the ropes, A B, knotted\r\ntogether, being drawn as tight as possible; we unlay the strand,\r\na', of the rope, A, for half the length of the splice, and twist the\r\nstrand, b', of the rope, B, strongly in its place, tying a' and b'\r\ntogether tightly. The same process is again gone through on the rope,\r\nB, the strand, a\", of the rope, A, being knotted to the strand, b\",\r\nof the rope, B. When all the strands are thus knotted together, we\r\ninterlace them with the strands of the cable. Thus the strands, a a'\r\na\", are interlocked by being passed alternately above and below the\r\nturns of the cord, B, the ends being also sometimes \"whipped.\" In the\r\nsame manner the strands, b b' b\", pass alternately over and under\r\nthe strands of the rope, A, and are in like manner \"whipped.\" It is\r\nimportant that the several interlacings and knots should not meet at\r\none point; we reduce the size of the strands towards the end, so that\r\nthey loose themselves in the body of the splice, cutting off such\r\nparts as may project. This splice is employed for joining the ends of\r\na rope when a chafed part has been cut out, and is quite as strong as\r\nthe rope itself.\r\n\r\n40. Belaying-pin opened to serve as a button; these are used where it\r\nis necessary to stop or check velocity.\r\n\r\n41. Chain knot, or fastening.\r\n\r\n42. Variable or regulating lashing. By laying the piece, a f,\r\nhorizontally, it can be slipped along the rope, b; by raising or\r\nlowering this, we shall raise or depress the weight, c, the cord, b,\r\nrunning over the two pulleys, d, from the piece, a f, in the direction\r\nshown in the figure. The friction of the cord, b, passing through the\r\nhole, e, sufficiently fixes the piece, a f, and holds the weight, c,\r\nsecurely.\r\n\r\n43. Cleet, with three ties.\r\n\r\n44. Cleet, showing the mode of belaying the cord.\r\n\r\n45. The piece, a f, of No. 42.\r\n\r\n46. Fair leader.\r\n\r\n47. Cleet to be fixed to a stay.\r\n\r\n48. Loop for slipping other lines.\r\n\r\n49. A \"bend\" which is only used for fear of the stoppers snapping.\r\n\r\n50. Bastard loop, made on the end of the rope, and whipped with yarns.\r\n\r\n51. Tie to pins: a, the pin; b, small cords fixed by a cross tie.\r\n\r\n52. Cleet, fixed to the \"rail,\" either with screws or nails, to which\r\nthe lines are belayed.\r\n\r\n53. Waterman's knot.\r\n\r\n54. Fair leader.\r\n\r\n55. Tie, or bend to pier.\r\n\r\n56. Simple fastening to tie.\r\n\r\n57. Fastening by a loop. This can be tied or untied without loosening\r\nthe loop itself. It is made by following, towards the longer loop, the\r\ndirection as numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and is terminated by the loop, 6,\r\n7, 6, finally passing it over the head of the post, A. This knot holds\r\nitself, the turns being in opposite directions. To untie it, we slack\r\nthe turns of the cable sufficiently to again pass the loop, 6, 7, 6,\r\nover the post, A, and turn the ends in the contrary direction to that\r\nin which they were made (as 5, 4, 3, 2, 1).\r\n\r\n58. Iron \"shell,\" in two views.\r\n\r\n59 and 60. \"Wedding\" knots; a b, eyelets; c d, the join; e, the\r\nfastening.\r\n\r\n61. Lark's-head fastening to running knot.\r\n\r\n62. A round turn; the cord, a, is passed through the bight of the\r\ncord, b, over the button, c, where it is secured by an ordinary knot.\r\n\r\n63. Belaying-pin splice. The cord, b, \"stops\" the pin, e, its end\r\nbeing spliced upon itself, and \"served\" with yarn; this rope, with its\r\npin, is passed through the spliced eye, f of the line, g.\r\n\r\n64. Round button.\r\n\r\n65. Joint by a spherical shell, each loop, a and b, being made by ties\r\nand splices, and surrounding the shell, c.\r\n\r\n66. Belaying-pin, shown separately, before being stoppered.\r\n\r\n67. Fastening to shears.\r\n\r\n68. Square mooring. When the cable is round the post, A, and the\r\npiece, c, without being crossed, it lays in the section 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\r\n6, 7, and the end is fastened by tying.\r\n\r\n69. Wooden shell in section.\r\n\r\n70. Crossed fastening. The turns of the cable, passing in front of the\r\npost, B, are crossed at the back of C, in the direction 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,\r\n6, 7, 8, the end, 8, being secured to the cable.\r\n\r\n71. Wooden shell.\r\n\r\n72. Double-chain fastening.\r\n\r\n73. Lashing for \"ram\" block, or \"dead-eye.\" The ram blocks, a and b,\r\nare strapped by the cords, e, which hold them; the small lanyards,\r\nd, pass through the holes to make the connection, and as they are\r\ntightened give the requisite tension to the cordage; the ends are\r\nfastened to the main rope. Usually one of these dead-eyes is held by\r\nan iron strap to the point where it is required to fix and strain the\r\ncordage, which is ordinarily a shroud.\r\n\r\n74. Chain fastening.\r\n\r\n  1'. Simple band, showing the upper side.\r\n\r\n  2'. The same, showing the under side and the knot.\r\n\r\n  3'. Tie, with crossed ends, commenced; a turn is taken under the\r\n  strands, to hold the ends of the cord.\r\n\r\n  4'. The same, completed.\r\n\r\n  5'. Bend with crossed strands, commenced, the one end being looped\r\n  over the other.\r\n\r\n  6'. The same, completed.\r\n\r\n  7'. Necklace tie, seen on the upper side.\r\n\r\n  8'. The same, seen underneath. The greater the strain on the cords,\r\n  the tighter the knot becomes.\r\n\r\n  9' and 10' are similar splices to 7' and 8' with slight\r\n  modifications.\r\n\r\n  11' shows the commencement of 13', the legs in elevation; 12' being\r\n  a front view. An ordinary band, made by several turns of a small\r\n  rope, is lapped round them and hauled taut, and then interlaced at\r\n  the ends. This done, the legs are shifted into the shape of a St.\r\n  Andrew's cross. Thus the lashing is tightened, and, for further\r\n  security, we pass the line several times over the tie and between\r\n  the spars, knotting the ends.\r\n\r\n  13'. Portuguese knot. This is a lashing for shear legs, and must be\r\n  tight enough to prevent the spars slipping on each other; the\r\n  crossing of the two legs gives a means of securing the knot.\r\n\r\n  14'. For binding timbers; a, knot commenced. Take several turns\r\n  round the timbers, and fasten the ends by passing them under the\r\n  turns; b, knot completed. The end of a round stick, m n, termed a\r\n  packing stick, should be passed under the knob, the cord being slack\r\n  enough to allow of this. By turning the stick, the turns can be\r\n  tightened to any extent; when tight, we fasten the longer arm of the\r\n  lever to some fixed point, by a rope, p q, so that it cannot fly\r\n  back. Care must be taken not to turn the stick too far, or the rope\r\n  may be broken. As the timber dries and shrinks, the lever may be\r\n  used to make all taut again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HARTFORD STEAM BOILER INSPECTION AND INSURANCE COMPANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hartford Steam Boiler Inspection and Insurance Company makes the\r\nfollowing report of its inspections in January, 1871:\r\n\r\nDuring the month, there were 522 visits of inspection made, and 1,030\r\nboilers examined--853 externally and 363 internally, while 106\r\nhave been tested by hydraulic pressure. Number of defects in all\r\ndiscovered, 431, of which 163 were regarded as dangerous. These\r\ndefects were as follows: Furnaces out of shape, 24--3 dangerous;\r\nfractures, 47--25 dangerous; burned plates, 29--14 dangerous;\r\nblistered plates, 54--10 dangerous; cases of sediment and deposit,\r\n97--18 dangerous; cases of incrustation and scale, 70--24 dangerous.\r\nTo show how little attention is paid to the internal condition of\r\nboilers by incompetent engineers, we copy the following from a letter\r\nof one of our inspectors:\r\n\r\n\"In one tubular boiler I found sediment in the back end, eight inches\r\ndeep, and extending forward more than four feet. It seemed to be an\r\naccumulation of fine scale cemented together, so that it was necessary\r\nto break it up with a hammer and chisel before it could be removed.\r\nThe engineer said _he had cleaned the boilers only three days before_,\r\nand objected to my making another examination. This is one of the\r\nmany cases we find, where the proprietor trusts everything about his\r\nboilers to his engineer, supposing him to be reliable.\"\r\n\r\nWith such accumulation of sediment and deposit, is it any wonder that\r\nsheets are burned? A careful engineer will understand, if the feed\r\nwater be impure, that he must blow down two or three inches every day,\r\nor oftener, that the sediment may be removed as it accumulates, and\r\nthen an internal examination once in two weeks, or once a month, will\r\ninsure a clean boiler.\r\n\r\nCases of external corrosion, 26--10 dangerous; cases of internal\r\ncorrosion, 17--5 dangerous; cases of internal grooving, 28--11\r\ndangerous; water gages out of order, 50; blow-out apparatus out of\r\norder, 15--7 dangerous; safety valves overloaded, 40--12 dangerous;\r\npressure gages out of order, 54--6 dangerous, varying from -15 to\r\n+8 pounds. (We have found several gages entirely ruined from being\r\nfrozen). Boilers without gages, 4; cases of deficiency of water,\r\n5--1 dangerous; broken braces and stays, 31--7 dangerous; boilers\r\ncondemned, 2--both dangerous.\r\n\r\nTwo engineers were found drunk on duty, and promptly discharged. There\r\nwere 9 serious explosions during the month, by which 99 persons were\r\nkilled, and 6 wounded. Eighty-seven of the killed were passengers on\r\nthe ill-fated steamer _H.R. Arthur_, on the Mississippi River. Many\r\nwere drowned, and some burned, but the origin of the calamity was the\r\nbad quality of the boilers, which a careless management was unable\r\nto detect. The upper and fore part of the boat was blown away by the\r\nexploded boilers, and, to add to the horror, what remained took fire.\r\n\r\nNone of these exploded boilers were under the care of this company.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFive ore-roasting furnaces are in full blast in Nevada.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPROVED COMPOUND SPIRAL CAR SPRING FOR RAILWAY CARRIAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur engravings illustrate an improved compound car-spring, which\r\nappears to possess all the requisites of a first-class spring,\r\ncombining in its construction extreme simplicity with great strength,\r\nand a feature whereby the power of the spring increases with increase\r\nof the load, and _vice versa_, so that its flexibility remains nearly\r\nconstant for all loads.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 is a perspective view of this spring, with a portion of the\r\nside of the case broken out to show the interior arrangement of the\r\nspiral springs. Fig. 2 is a section of the compressing plate. Fig. 3\r\nis a plan view, showing the arrangement of the tubes which enclose the\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POTT'S' SPIRAL CAR SPRING FOR RAILWAY CARRIAGES.\r\n_Fig. 1       Fig. 2        Fig. 3_]\r\n\r\nThe case is cast in two pieces. Its vertical wall is cast in a single\r\npiece, and has at the top a flange or bead extending inwardly, against\r\nwhich the compressing plate abuts when the spring is not compressed,\r\nas shown in Fig. 2. A bottom plate completes the case.\r\n\r\nThe spiral components of the spring are inclosed in tubes, as shown in\r\nFigs. 1 and 3. It is not deemed essential that these tubes should be\r\nseamless, or that their edges, brought together in bending, should be\r\nsoldered, brazed, or welded. They act merely as guides to compel the\r\ncomponent springs to expand or contract in vertical lines, and need\r\nonly be strong enough for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe compressing plate is formed with concentric steps or ledges,\r\nas shown in Fig. 2, so that with light loads, only a portion of the\r\ncomponent spirals act. With a heavier load a new series of spirals is\r\nbrought into action, and so on, till the spring is loaded to its full\r\ncapacity. This feature is novel, and as important as novel, as it\r\ngives the spring a far more easy and flexible carriage, with light\r\nloads, than would be the case if all the spirals were permitted to\r\nact.\r\n\r\nIn putting the spring together, the vertical part of the case is\r\ninverted. The compressing plate is then placed within the case,\r\nresting upon the inner flange of the case above described. The tubes\r\nwith their inclosed springs are then arranged in position, as shown in\r\nthe plan view, Fig. 3. The bottom plate of the case is then placed in\r\nposition, and held to its place by lugs and rivets, as shown in Fig.\r\n1; the spring is then ready for use.\r\n\r\nThe employment of tubes in the manner described, enables springs of\r\nthe greatest practical length to be used, without the sectional or\r\ndivision plates met with in other spiral car springs. A greater\r\nand easier movement is therefore obtained. These springs can, it\r\nis claimed, compete in price with any spring in market, and are\r\nguaranteed by the manufacturers.

G. Buzby, of Philadelphia, Pa. It\r\nis a combined writing and copying case. Besides the usual recesses\r\nor chambers for pen, ink, paper, etc., it is provided with a book of\r\ncopying paper, in which copies of important letters may be made, by\r\ndamping the letters in the usual way, and pressing them between the\r\nleaves of the copying book; or the transfer paper may be used, so that\r\nthe letter will be copied as it is written, if preferred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WALKING STICKS ARE MADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSticks are manufactured both from large timber of from two to six\r\nfeet girth, and from small underwood of about the thickness of a man's\r\nthumb. The timber, which is chiefly beech, is first sawed into battens\r\nof about three feet in length and as many inches in width; and\r\nfrom each of these battens two square sticks, with square heads are\r\nafterwards cut in opposite directions, so that the middle portion\r\nis waste wood. The corners of each are afterwards rounded off by a\r\nplaning process called \"trapping,\" and the square head is reduced, by\r\na small saw, to a curve or rectangular bend, so as to form a handle.\r\nWhen the sticks are brought in this way to the exact size and pattern,\r\nthey are polished with great care, are finely varnished, and packed\r\nin boxes or bundles for the market. Many sawn sticks, however, are\r\nsupplied with bone and horn handles, which are fastened on with glue;\r\nand then of course there is less wood waste, as a larger number of\r\nthem may be cut from one batten.\r\n\r\nA very different process takes place in the manufacture of sticks\r\nfrom small underwood, in which there is no sawing required. The rough\r\nunfashioned sticks, which are generally of hazel, ash, oak and thorn,\r\nare cut with a bill in the same way as kidney bean sticks, and are\r\nbrought to the factory in large bavins or bundles, piled on a timber\r\ntug. There must of course, be some little care in their selection, yet\r\nit is evident that the woodmen are not very particular on this score,\r\nfor they have in general an ungainly appearance; and many are so\r\ncrooked and rough, that no drover or country boy would think it worth\r\nwhile to polish the like of them with his knife. Having arrived at\r\nthis place, however, their numerous excrescences are soon pruned away,\r\nand their ugliness converted into elegance. When sufficiently seasoned\r\nand fit for working, they are first laid to soak in wet sand, and\r\nrendered more tough and pliable; a workman then takes them one by one,\r\nand securing them with an iron stock, bends them skillfully this way\r\nand that, so as to bring out their natural crooks, and render them at\r\nlast all straight even rods. If they are not required to be knotted,\r\nthey next go to the \"trapper,\" who puts them through a kind of\r\ncircular plane, which takes off knots, and renders them uniformly\r\nsmooth and round. The most important process of all is that of giving\r\nthem their elegantly curved handles, for which purpose they are passed\r\nover to the \"crooker.\" Every child knows that if we bend a tough stick\r\nmoderately when the pressure is discontinued, it will soon fly back,\r\nmore or less, to its former position; and if we bend it very much,\r\nit will break. Now the crooker professes to accomplish the miracle of\r\nbending a stick as it might be an iron wire, so that it shall neither\r\nbreak nor \"backen.\" To prevent the breaking, the wood is rendered\r\npliant by further soaking in wet sand; and a flexible band of metal\r\nis clamped down firmly to that portion of the stick that will form the\r\noutside of the curve; the top end is then fitted into a grooved iron\r\nshoulder which determines the size of the crook, the other end being\r\nbrought round so as to point in the opposite direction; the metal\r\nband during this process binding with increasing tightness against the\r\nstretching fibers of the wood, so that they cannot snap or give way\r\nunder the strain. The crook having been made, the next thing is to fix\r\nit, or remove from the fibers the reaction of elasticity, which would\r\notherwise, on the cessation of the bending force, cause it to backen\r\nmore or less, and undo the work. In the old process of crooking by\r\nsteam, as timber bending is effected, the stick was merely left till\r\nit was cold to acquire a permanent set; but in the new process, a more\r\npermanent set is given by turning the handle about briskly over a jet\r\nof gas. The sticks being now fashioned, it only remains to polish\r\nand stain or varnish them; and they are sometimes scorched or\r\nburned brown, and carved with foliage, animal heads and other\r\ndevices.--_Chambers' Journal_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOWERING OF THE VICTORIA REGIA IN THE OPEN AIR.--Joseph Mager, Esq.,\r\nhas succeeded in flowering the Victoria lily, in his pond in England.\r\nThe pond is perfectly open, but the water is heated by hot water pipes\r\ncoming from a boiler near the pond, carefully concealed. The seeds\r\nof the Victoria were planted in May last, and the first flower was\r\nproduced Sept. 10th. Afterwards seven other flowers opened. The plant\r\nhas eight leaves, of which the largest is five feet two inches in\r\ndiameter.

W.\r\nRailroad, was worked until recently by a rope and stationary engine,\r\nto avoid fouling the air of the tunnel by the passage of locomotives;\r\nbut the increase of the traffic having necessitated the abandonment of\r\nthe rope and the substitution of locomotives for bringing the trains\r\nup through the tunnel, it became requisite to provide some efficient\r\nmeans of ventilation for clearing the tunnel speedily of the smoke and\r\nsteam after the passage of each train. A large exhausting fan has been\r\ndesigned by Mr. John Ramsbottom for this purpose, which works in a\r\nchamber situated near the middle of the length of the tunnel, and\r\ndraws the air in from the tunnel, through a cross drift; discharging\r\nit up a tapering chimney that extends to a considerable hight above\r\nthe surface of the ground over the tunnel. The fan is about thirty\r\nfeet diameter, and is made with straight radial vanes; it revolves\r\non a horizontal shaft at a speed of about forty-five revolutions per\r\nminute, within a brick casing, built concentric with the fan for the\r\nfirst half of the circumference, and afterwards expanding gradually\r\nfor discharging into the base of the chimney, the air from the tunnel\r\nbeing drawn in at the center of the fan at each side, and discharged\r\nfrom the circumference of the fan by the revolution of the vanes.\r\nThe engine driving the fan is started by telegraph signal at each\r\ndeparture of a train from the terminal station, and the fan is kept\r\nrunning until the discharge from it becomes quite clear, showing that\r\nno steam or smoke remains in the tunnel; this is usually the case in\r\nabout eight minutes after the time of the train entering the lower end\r\nof the tunnel, the passage of the train through the tunnel occupying\r\nabout three minutes. The fan draws air in at both ends of the tunnel\r\nsimultaneously, and begins to clear the lower end immediately upon the\r\ntrain entering; the clearing of the upper end commences as soon as the\r\ntrain has passed out of the tunnel, and as the fan is situated nearer\r\nthe upper end of the tunnel than the lower, the clearing of both\r\nlengths is completed almost simultaneously. The fan is so constructed\r\nas to allow an uninterrupted passage through it, for the air, whilst\r\nthe fan is standing still; and the natural ventilation thus obtained\r\nby means of the large chimney is found sufficient for clearing the\r\ntunnel during the night and some portion of the day, without the fan\r\nbeing worked at those times. This natural ventilation is aided by the\r\nengine exhaust and the boiler discharging into the chimney. The fan\r\nhas now been in regular operation for three-quarters of a year, and\r\nhas been found completely successful.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPREGNATING WOOD WITH TAR OR OTHER PRESERVING MATERIAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preservation of wood is a problem which is attracting increased\r\nattention, as year by year diminishes the material supply of timber,\r\nand consequently gradually increases its price. Among other methods\r\nemployed, the impregnation of wood by the vapors of tar, creosote,\r\npetroleum, etc., has been tried, and one of the practical difficulties\r\nmet with has been the obtaining of suitable apparatus for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe engraving annexed is an invention intended to supply this want.\r\nThe wood is inclosed, in a tank kept hot by a steam jacket which\r\nsurrounds it, as shown. A boiler at one end is used to heat the\r\nsubstance with which it is desired to impregnate the wood. An air pump\r\nis also employed to remove the steam, generated in the heated timber,\r\nand the air from the tank. The pores of the wood being thus rendered\r\nvacuous, the hot liquid or vapors from the heating tank readily\r\npenetrate the entire substance, and thoroughly impregnate it. This\r\napparatus is the invention of George Pustkuchen, of Hoboken, N.

EDITORS:--I have hesitated about the propriety of replying to\r\nthe criticisms of your correspondent, J. E. Hendricks, upon my paper,\r\non the action of the reciprocating parts of steam engines. It is not\r\nto be expected that a truth so opposed to commonly received\r\nnotions--the reception of which requires so much to be unlearned--should\r\nat once receive the assent of every one. Some odd fancies on the\r\nsubject are likely to be ventilated first.\r\n\r\nBut your correspondent touches the root of the matter, and perhaps the\r\nfact questioned by him should be more clearly placed beyond dispute.\r\n\r\nI will dismiss the introductory part of his letter, merely observing\r\nthat his \"logical inference\" is quite gratuitous and unwarranted. He\r\nsays himself that its absurdity is obvious, in which I quite agree\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nThe real question is this: What is the figure representing the\r\nacceleration of the motion of a piston, controlled by a crank which\r\nrevolves with a uniform velocity? I stated it to be a right-angled\r\ntriangle, and indicated, as I supposed, clearly enough, a simple\r\nmethod by which this could be shown. Your correspondent claims that\r\nthe calculation, according to my own rule, gives a figure of a totally\r\ndifferent form, and one that shows the acceleration, as well as the\r\nmotion, to be reduced to zero at the commencement of the stroke. Let\r\nus see. Let the straight line, AJ, in the following figure, represent\r\nhalf the stroke of the piston, and let the distances, AB, AC, etc., on\r\nthis line, represent the versed sines of 10 deg., 20 deg., etc., up to 90 deg., or\r\nthe motion of the piston while the crank is moving through these arcs.\r\nAt the points A, B, C, etc., erect the perpendiculars, Aa, Bb, Cc,\r\netc., and let the length of each of these ordinates represent the\r\nacceleration imparted in a given time at that point of the stroke.\r\nThen will AJ be to Aa as IJ is to Ii, as HJ is to Hh, etc., showing\r\nthat the straight line, aJ, connects the extremities of all the\r\nordinates, and that the triangle, AJa, represents the acceleration of\r\nthe motion of the piston, from the commencement to the middle of the\r\nstroke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe following table will enable any one to make the calculations\r\nproving the truth of the above proposition:\r\n\r\nDegrees.

The ordinary tables in the hand-books, going\r\nonly to five places of decimals, are of no use for these computations.\r\n\r\nI would suggest a practical experiment. Let any one having an engine\r\nrunning at a good speed, loosen the crank pin brasses a little, so\r\nthat, at starting, it will thump heavily. Let the engine be lightly\r\nloaded, so that only a small portion of the boiler pressure will need\r\nto be admitted to the cylinder. As its speed increases, the thump\r\nwill die away; and, if at its full speed, the pressure of the steam\r\nadmitted is not so great as to overcome the centrifugal strain of the\r\nreciprocating parts on the crank, as it passes the centers, the engine\r\nwill revolve in silence. Any one can ascertain, by the rule given\r\nin the note to the paper, just what pressure can be admitted without\r\ncausing a thump, or this can be found by a little experimenting. I am\r\nrunning an engine which does not thump with loose crank pin brasses,\r\nunder eighty pounds pressure, admitted sharply on the centers.\r\n\r\nCharles T.

EDITORS:--In one of the late numbers of your journal, you\r\npublish a paper, read by Mr. Porter before some learned society in New\r\nYork, on something about the possibility or practicability of running\r\na steam engine at a high rate of speed, and claiming to give a\r\nscientific explanation of the why and wherefore. Now, scientifically,\r\nI know nothing about a steam engine; practically, I know how to stop\r\nand start one. Therefore, you will understand that what I say is not\r\nas coming from one who claims to be wise above what is written, but as\r\nsimply being a statement of the case, as it appears to one who wants\r\nto learn, and takes this way to draw out the truth. A scientific\r\ntheory, invested with all its sines, coefficients, and other\r\nparaphernalia, is a very pretty thing to look at, no doubt, for those\r\nwho understand it, and, when properly applied, is invaluable; but\r\nwhen, as in this case, a practical question is to be decided, by the\r\naid of a scientific demonstration, it will not do to throw aside the\r\nmain elements of the problem, or any, in fact, of the minor points, no\r\nmatter how trivial they may appear.\r\n\r\nMr. Porter's labors were strictly of a scientific nature. He starts\r\nout with the proposition that what he is about to explain is very\r\nsimple, and very likely it is; but, for one, I can't see it, and I\r\nwant more light. He says that it takes a certain number of pounds to\r\novercome the inertia of the reciprocating parts of a certain weight,\r\nto give it a certain speed. What is inertia? He says, \"we will not\r\ntake into account the friction of parts.\" Now, my understanding of\r\nthis point is, that friction is practically one of the main elements\r\nin the problem. How can we hope to obtain a correct solution when he\r\nrubs out one of the terms of the equation? What is friction doing all\r\nthe time, while he is theoretically having his reciprocating parts\r\nstoring up power and then giving it out again, just at the right time,\r\nand in the right quantity?\r\n\r\nWhat an immense amount of iron has been wasted by being cast into fly\r\nwheels, when a fraction of the amount, if only put into cross heads,\r\nwould render fly wheels unnecessary!\r\n\r\nMr. Porter stops short in his discussion. He should have added a table\r\ngiving the proportionate length of stroke, weight of parts, and number\r\nof revolutions required to produce the effect of an engine running at\r\na high speed, without the least fraction of inequality in the strain\r\non the crank, and then the sun would have fairly risen in the \"dawn of\r\na new era for the steam engine.\" But, as it is so very simple, we can\r\nall figure it out for ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn the diagram Mr. Porter gives, to illustrate the travel of the\r\npiston, he wets his finger and draws it over another term in the\r\nequation (a method of elimination not taught by Hutton, Davies, and\r\nother mathematicians). It is a quick way, but is it correct? He says,\r\n\"the distance traveled by the piston is the versed sine of an angle\r\nformed by a line from the center of the crank pin, in any part of its\r\nstroke to the center of the circle described by the crank pin, leaving\r\nout of the calculation the angular vibration of the connecting rod.\"\r\nWhat he means by the \"angular vibration,\" I do not know. He is wrong\r\nin the statement. If he will think of it he will see it. If he meant\r\nto say that the piston's travel was measured by the versed sine of the\r\nangle formed by the connecting rod and the line of horizontal centers,\r\nhe is wrong again, yet nearer the truth than before, just as the\r\nproportion between the length of the connecting rod and the half\r\ndiameter of the circle described by the crank pin. This can quickly\r\nbe seen by supposing the connecting rod to be detached, and allowed\r\nto fall down on the center line, at any part of the stroke. If he\r\nunderstood this (as no doubt he did), he should not ignore the facts.\r\n\r\nWhat I am aiming at is this. When a man attempts to demonstrate a\r\nthing mathematically, he must take into his calculation everything\r\nessentially connected with the problem, just exactly as it is, and not\r\nas he would have it; otherwise, he cannot, by any possibility, attain\r\na correct result. When he claims, as now, the practicability of\r\nrunning engines at a high speed, I think he is claiming too much.\r\nBuild an engine of proper materials, make it strong, and fit\r\neverything as it should be, balance crank and fly wheel to a nicety,\r\nkeep everything snugly in its place, and the terrors of a quick stroke\r\nvanish.\r\n\r\nS.

EDITORS:--I have read, with much interest, Dr. Chandler's\r\ncolorimetric test of the purity of white lead, as published in the\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN sometime ago. I enclose another test, which,\r\nthough not new, is of value to all using white lead on account of its\r\nsimplicity and effectiveness. It has been in use here for nearly two\r\nyears, and has been found reliable. Having never seen it in print, I\r\nhave tried to put it in as simple words as possible.\r\n\r\nFELIX MCARDLE, Analytical Chemist.\r\nSt. Louis, Mo.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of firm, close grained charcoal, and, near one end of it,\r\nscoop out a cavity about half an inch in diameter and a quarter of an\r\ninch in depth. Place in the cavity a sample, of the lead to be tested,\r\nabout the size of a small pea, and apply to it continuously the\r\nblue or hottest part of the flame of the blow pipe; if the sample be\r\nstrictly pure, it will in a very short time, say in two minutes, be\r\nreduced to metallic lead, leaving no residue; but if it be adulterated\r\nto the extent of ten per cent. only, with oxide of zinc, sulphate of\r\nbaryta, whiting or any other carbonate of lime, (which substances are\r\nnow the only adulterations used), or if it be composed entirely of\r\nthese materials, as is sometimes the case with cheap lead, it cannot\r\nbe reduced, but will remain on the charcoal an infusible mass.\r\n\r\nDry white lead, (carbonate of lead) is composed of metallic lead,\r\noxygen and carbonic acid, and, when ground with linseed oil, forms the\r\nwhite lead of commerce. When it is subjected to the above treatment,\r\nthe oil is first burned off, and then at a certain degree of heat, the\r\noxygen and carbonic acid are set free, leaving only the metallic lead\r\nfrom which it was manufactured. If, however, there be present in the\r\nsample any of the above mentioned adulterations, they cannot of course\r\nbe reduced to metallic lead, and cannot be reduced, by any heat of\r\nthe blow pipe flame, to their own metallic bases; and being intimately\r\nincorporated and ground with the carbonate of lead, they prevent it\r\nfrom being reduced.\r\n\r\nIt is well, after blowing upon the sample, say for half a minute, by\r\nwhich time the oil will be burned off, to loosen the sample from the\r\ncharcoal, with a knife blade or spatula, in order that the flame may\r\npass under as well as over and against it. With proper care the lead\r\nwill run into one button, instead of scattering over the charcoal,\r\nand this is the reason why the cavity above mentioned is necessary. A\r\ncommon star candle or a lard oil lamp furnishes the best flame for use\r\nof the blow pipe; a coal oil lamp should not be used.\r\n\r\nBy the above test, after a little practice, so small an adulteration\r\nas one or two per cent. can be detected; it is, however, only a test\r\nof the purity or impurity of a lead, and if found adulterated, the\r\ndegree or percentage of adulteration cannot be well ascertained by it.\r\n\r\nJewellers usually have all the necessary apparatus for making the\r\ntest, and any one of them can readily make it by observing the above\r\ndirections, and from them can be obtained a blow pipe at small cost.\r\n\r\nIf you have no open package of the lead to be tested, a sample can\r\nmost easily be obtained by boring into the side or top of a keg with\r\na gimlet, and with it taking out the required quantity; care should be\r\nused to free it entirely from the borings or particles of wood, and it\r\nshould not be larger than the size mentioned; a larger quantity can be\r\nreduced, but of course more time will be required, and the experiment\r\ncannot be so neatly performed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD A CHIMNEY.\r\n\r\nMESSRS. EDITORS:--I am satisfied that a great many fires originate\r\nthrough poorly constructed chimneys; and, although not a bricklayer\r\nby trade, I would offer a few hints how to construct a fire-proof\r\nchimney. Let the bed be laid of brick and mortar, iron, or stone; then\r\nthe workman should take a brick in his left hand, and with the trowel,\r\ndraw the mortar upon the end of the brick, from the under side, and\r\nnot from the outside edge, as is usual. Then, by pressing the brick\r\nagainst the next one, the whole space between the two bricks will be\r\nfilled with mortar; and so he should point up the inside as perfectly\r\nas the outside, as he proceeds.\r\n\r\nBy drawing the mortar on the edge of the brick, the space between\r\nthe ends will not always be entirely filled, and will make (where the\r\ninside pointing is not attended to) a leaky and unsafe chimney, which,\r\nif not kept clear of soot, will, in burning out, stand a good chance\r\nof setting the building on fire. The best thing that I know of, to\r\nput the fire out in a burning chimney is salt; but the matter of first\r\nimportance, after having a chimney properly constructed, is to keep it\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nAUSTIN B.

An excavation,\r\nfive or six feet, into the wall, revealed the skeleton of a man laid\r\nat length, having an extra coverlid of wooden material. Eighteen large\r\noblong beads, an ax of polished green stone, eleven arrow points, and\r\nfive implements of bone (to be described) were deposited on the\r\nleft side; and a few small beads, an ornamental shell pin, two small\r\nhatchets, and a sharp-pointed flint knife or lance, eight inches long,\r\nhaving a neck or projection at the base, suitable for a handle, or for\r\ninsertion in a shaft, on the right side. The earth behind the skull\r\nbeing removed, three enormous conch shells presented their open\r\nmouths. One of my assistants started back as if the ghost of the\r\ndeparted had come to claim the treasure preserved, in accordance with\r\nsuperstitious notions, for its journey to the \"happy lands.\" The alarm\r\nseemed to be a warning, for at the moment the embankment, overloaded\r\non one side, caved in, nearly burying three workmen, myself, and a\r\nspectator. Our tools being at the bottom of the heap, and the wall on\r\nthe other side, shaken by the falling earth, giving tokens of a change\r\nof base, our prospects of a ready deliverance were not very hopeful.\r\nThe bystanders, however, went to work with their hands, and we were\r\nsoon relieved, not without casualty, the spectator having the worst of\r\nit. Struggling to extricate himself, instead of abiding his time, he\r\ndragged one leg out of the pile shorter than the other.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of marine shells in a burial depository, especially of\r\nthe varieties pyrula and oliva, four or five hundred miles from the\r\nGulf and that portion of the Southern coast where the mollusks exist,\r\nbears upon the question of migration and tribal intercourse, and\r\nthe commercial value of these articles. Obtained from a distance and\r\nregarded as precious commodities, they were used in exchange, for the\r\nmaterial of ornaments, and for choice utensils. Only two or three of\r\nthese shells have been found in a perfect condition, but defective\r\nones are frequent, with fragments, \"cuttings,\" and various trinkets\r\nmade out of them--such as ornamental pins, needles, crosses, buttons,\r\namulets, engraved plates, and beads. From one of the specimens\r\nrecovered from the mound sepulchre, the spire and columella had been\r\nremoved, leaving a hollow utensil. It would have been suitable for\r\na water vessel, but for a hole in the bottom, which had furnished a\r\nbutton-shaped ornament, or piece of money, which was found with the\r\nrelic, and exactly corresponded to the orifice. The twirled end of the\r\nshell, however, had been improved for a handle by shallow cavities,\r\none on the inside slanting from the middle longitudinal line, and one\r\ncrossing that line at right angles on the convex side, so as to be\r\nfitted to the thumb and fore finger of the left hand, suggesting a use\r\nof the implement as a shield, or a mask held before the face. Adair\r\nspeaks of large shells in use by the Indians of his time (1735),\r\nsuspended about the neck for shields, and regarded as badges of\r\npriestly dignity.\r\n\r\nA trench was dug on the east side of the mound, nearly corresponding\r\nin dimensions to the one on the west side, making the length of the\r\nwhole excavation, including the central cavity, thirty-two feet.\r\n\r\nIn the last opening, eight skeletons were exhumed; the mode of burial\r\nwas the same throughout. The only article of value recovered was a\r\ncuriously wrought pipe of stone, having a \"figure head\" representing\r\nthe human face, which I have put down in a list of \"articles stolen,\"\r\nand which the thief can describe better than the writer. After filling\r\nup all the gaps, and levelling the surface to suit the taste of the\r\nproprietor, we closed our labors on the mound in the Bent.\r\n\r\nOf the skulls collected, it is sufficient to say that they belong to\r\nthe \"short heads,\" the length and breadth having a comparative medium\r\nproportion, a common form of cranium in the mounds of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nOf stone implements I specify an ax of serpentine, ten inches long,\r\ntwo thick, and four broad, having plain sides and a straight edge\r\nground down on both of the flat faces; hatchets (\"tomahawks\") of\r\ngreen stone, flint, and diorite, from five to eight inches long, with\r\nrounded faces and sides, contracted to an edge at one end, and to a\r\nflat heel at the other; a wedge of black slate, seven inches long and\r\nhalf an inch thick, of a square finish on the faces and sides and at\r\nthe heel, which was diminished two inches, as compared with the length\r\nof the edge; hatchets with a serrated edge at each end, plane on both\r\nsides, convex on one face and flat on the other.\r\n\r\nWith one skeleton was deposited a \"set of tools,\" eight in number, of\r\nthe species of rock before mentioned, varying in length from two to\r\neight inches. Their peculiarity consists in a variety of shapes--no\r\ntwo being precisely alike--and in their fitness to various uses,\r\nsuch as carving, hacking, paring, and grooving. The smallest of them,\r\nhaving a square finish, was held by the thumb and two fingers, and is\r\nsuitable for cutting lines and figures in wood and shells. Specimens\r\nof this art were furnished from the mound. The largest number might\r\nserve for hatchets, chisels, and gouges. One had been ground in the\r\nform of a cylinder five inches long and an inch thick, and then cut\r\nan inch on two sides to an edge, and worked into a handle with a round\r\nbead, from the center of the elliptical faces. It might be used for\r\nchipping wood and stone. One answered the purpose of a cold chisel;\r\nanother was somewhat similar, but had a hollow face reduced to a\r\ncurved edge for grooving. These polished instruments, wrought with\r\nmuch care, seemed intended for use by the hand rather than for\r\ninsertion in a handle or socket, or attachment to a shaft by means\r\nof a strap or withe. Only one was perforated. The drilling through\r\ngranite, quartz, and diorite, without the use of metal, was a severe\r\nlabor, even for savage patience. A long knife of silex, with a wrought\r\nhandle, lance heads, leaf shaped, of the same material, of beautiful\r\nworkmanship, arrow points of fine finish, furnished, with others\r\nbefore mentioned, an assortment of arms. Several flint points, though\r\nonly an inch long, were curved like a cimeter, and used probably as\r\nflaying instruments. True disks, of various mineral substances, from\r\nan inch to five inches in diameter, having convex faces, complete the\r\nlist of stone implements. Those of bone comprise several like hollow\r\nchisels, sharpened at one end, and pierced through one face, near the\r\nother extremity, so as to be fastened to a handle; these were used\r\nfor dressing skins. One was formed like a poniard, with a worked hilt.\r\nWith these may be connected arrow heads and sharp pointed weapons of\r\nthe worked antlers of the stag, and tusks of the wild boar.\r\n\r\nOf ornaments, I noticed pins used for dressing the hair, made of the\r\ncolumns of large sea shells. The head is generally round, sometimes\r\noval, from an eighth to a half of an inch in diameter, retaining the\r\ndiagonal groove of the pillar from which it is made. The stems vary\r\nin length from one to six inches. It would be tedious even to classify\r\nornamental beads and buttons of shell work, such as are usually found\r\nin the mounds. These trinkets are perforated, and, in addition to\r\ntheir being articles of dress, were used probably as \"wampum,\" the\r\ncurrency of the recent Indians.\r\n\r\nA miscellaneous collection includes a hematite stone, wrought in\r\nthe shape of a cup weighing half a pound; when rubbed or ground it\r\nfurnished the war paint of the savages; also the extremity of a copper\r\ntube, two inches long; needles in bone and shell, from an inch to\r\nsix inches long, with grooves round the head, to serve the purpose of\r\neyes; and plates of mica. The use of mica plates, which are found of\r\nlarge size in some of the Western mounds, has excited some inquiry.\r\nOf a certain thickness, they make good mirrors. Beside their use\r\nfor ornamental purposes, they were probably looking-glasses of the\r\nbeauties of the stone age. There was also found a pipe of soap stone,\r\nhaving a stem five inches long, and a bowl with a broad brim, like a\r\nQuaker's hat.\r\n\r\nOf earthenware, there was an endless variety of fragments of the usual\r\nblack, grey, or red compressed clay, mixed with pulverized shells or\r\nstones. One kind I have never seen described. The sherds had a red\r\ncoating on both sides, an eighth of an inch in thickness, evidently\r\nnot a paint or a glaze. The red coloring might have come from the\r\npottery being burnt in the open air, instead of baked in a furnace,\r\nwere not the layer of uniform thickness and of homogeneous paste,\r\nunlike the material of the vessel, which was a gray mixture of clay\r\nand particles of shells.\r\n\r\nI give the above memoranda to the general fund of information,\r\ntouching a subject that invites inquiry on account of its novelty and\r\nethnological importance. Every examination of the monumental remains\r\nof the ancient Americans brings to light some new feature in structure\r\nor type of rudimental art. And since archaeology has become a science,\r\ninvestigators, for half a century, may be looking about for facts to\r\ncomplete the system auspiciously introduced by the antiquarians of\r\nNorthern Europe, and advanced in our own country by the researches\r\nof Caleb Atwater (_Archaeologia Americana_) and by those of the\r\nSmithsonian contributors to knowledge, especially Squier and Davis.\r\nRAMBLER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA SMALL WATER WHEEL.--There is in the town of Meriden, Conn., a\r\nLeffel double turbine wheel, running under 240 feet fall and driving\r\na manufactory.

This is, also, beyond comparison the\r\ngreatest fall applied to the propulsion of a wheel in America.

V. ANDREWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA vague notion that silk culture ought to form one of the industrial\r\npursuits of the American people seems to be prevalent enough; but it\r\ndoes not take practical hold upon anybody. The nearest approach to\r\nanything practical which we have seen, in late years--excepting, of\r\ncourse, what has been done in California--occurred in New York in July\r\nlast, when a number of gentlemen pledged themselves, according to a\r\nreport given in the _Tribune_ of July 30, \"to promote the native silk\r\ntrade.\"\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen present at the meeting represented the most prominent\r\nsilk manufacturing and importing houses in this country. What these\r\ngentlemen have since done towards promoting the native silk trade, I\r\ndo not know, but, having pledged themselves, it is presumed they have\r\ndone something.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting, of which the _Tribune_ article is a report, dags,\r\nand other things, manufactured from California silk, were exhibited;\r\nand the report goes on to say that \"Mr. Warren also exhibited samples\r\nof native and foreign cocoons, and of raw and thrown silk, together\r\nwith the common _Cecropia_ and _Bombyx Cynthia_, species of\r\nsilkworms which feed upon oak leaves.  *  *  Also the _Bombyx Yamamai_\r\nwhich feeds upon mulberry leaves; also the _Bombyx Pernyi_, of\r\nwhich the cocoons are early as good as the cocoons of worms fed upon\r\nmulberry leaves.\"\r\n\r\nI have given this extract, word for word, as it stands in the columns\r\nof the _Tribune_, because it contains more blunders of one kind or\r\nanother than I remember ever to have seen in so many words. _Cecropia_\r\nis certainly not very particular as to its food, but it is not an oak\r\nfeeder. _Cynthia_ will thrive on nothing except ailanthus, though it\r\nwill eat one or two other things, but not oak. The _Yamamai_, on\r\nthe other hand, will eat oak, indeed it is its natural food; but Mr.\r\nWarren errs greatly when he says that it will feed on mulberry. The\r\nlast clause of the sentence, which says that cocoons of _Pernyi_ are\r\nnearly as good as those of worms fed on mulberry leaves, must be a\r\nsort of entomological joke, of which the point is not discoverable by\r\nme, so I pass it over.\r\n\r\nI do not, however, notice this report on account of its grammatical\r\nand entomological mistakes. It is because of the evil effects it may,\r\nand probably will, have on amateur silk culturists, that I notice\r\nit; for most assuredly, failure will be the result of all attempts\r\nto produce silk cocoons by feeding the caterpillars of the different\r\nmoths on the food prescribed by Mr. Warren. Any patriotic, money\r\nmaking farmer, who believes in the _Tribune_, purchasing _Yamamai_\r\neggs and setting his worms to feed upon mulberry, which they refuse to\r\neat, and consequently, all die, will probably give up silk culture\r\nas being nothing more or less than a humbug. And thus the cause is\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\nFor several years past, I have made some experiments in the rearing of\r\nthe silkworms, giving the result of my experience in the first year in\r\nVol. II., page 311, of the _American Naturalist_; and of a subsequent\r\nyear in the _Entomologist_, for November, 1869.\r\n\r\nThe paper in the _Naturalist_ is devoted to my experiments with the\r\nailanthus silkworm, _Samia Cynthia_ (G. & R.), a naturalized species\r\nfrom the East. In that paper, I have said all that is necessary to\r\nsay at present, on that species, except perhaps that I am further\r\nconvinced, from the inspection of samples of sewing and other silks,\r\nmade from the cocoons of _Cynthia_, that one day it will be reared\r\nvery extensively in the United States. It is perfectly hardy, is\r\ndouble brooded, and may be reared by any one possessed of a few acres\r\nof land, which may be good enough for growing ailanthus trees, but\r\nnot good enough to grow any thing else. The labor of a few old men,\r\nor women, or even children, is sufficient for the purpose. The cost is\r\ntherefore trifling.\r\n\r\nThe objection to the cultivation of _Cynthia_ is that the cocoon\r\ncannot be reeled. But it can be carded, and if the Chinese can make\r\nexcellent silk goods from it, why cannot we? I suspect, too, that\r\n_Cynthia_ silk can be worked in with cotton, or, perhaps, woolen\r\ngoods, adding to their beauty and durability (for it is indestructible\r\nin wear), and thus open up branches of manufacture hitherto unknown.\r\n\r\nFor manufacturers of coarse goods, I have no doubt that the silk\r\nfrom our native silk moths, _Cecropia_ and _Polyphemus_, may be used.\r\nIndeed, I believe that M. Trouvelot is of opinion that _Polyphemus_\r\nmay fairly enter into competition with _Bombyx mori_, the ordinary\r\nmulberry silkworm. The worm, however, is rather difficult to rear.\r\n\r\nIn reference, however, to _Bombyx mori_, it is well known that the\r\nsilk crop in France and Italy has been reduced greatly, and the price\r\nof silk goods consequently enhanced, by prevalence of disease among\r\nthe worms. So much is this the case, that silk breeders have been\r\nobliged to look around for some silk-producing moths whose products\r\nmay, at any rate, supplement the deficient crop. _Cynthia_, as already\r\nmentioned as one of these, and two others mentioned by Warren in the\r\n_Tribune_ reports above adverted to, are at present the subjects of\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nMy article mentioned before as appearing in the _American\r\nEntomologist_ is mainly devoted to my experiments, and those of my\r\ncorrespondents, with _Yamamai_, which, as I said before, is an oak\r\nfeeder. In Japan, which is its native country, it feeds, in its wild\r\nstate, on _Quercus serrata_. Whether that oak be found in America, I\r\ndo not know, but it is of little importance, as the worm will feed on\r\nalmost any species of oak, although I think that it prefers white oak.\r\nThe importance of acclimatizing new species of silk moths is of so\r\nmuch prospective importance, that I shall devote the remainder of this\r\narticle to the consideration of whether _Yamamai_ and _Pernyi_ may not\r\nbe naturalized here. Any one, who happens to have the number of the\r\n_Entomologist_ containing the article above alluded to, may find it\r\nworth while to read it, but as many persons may not be able to obtain\r\nthat number, I will here repeat the substance of my remarks, adding as\r\nmuch new matter as subsequent experience has afforded.\r\n\r\nThe silk from the _Yamamai_ being considered superior to that produced\r\nby any other of the substitute silk moths, great efforts have been\r\nmade in Europe to acclimatize it; but, it must be confessed, hitherto\r\nwith but slight success. There are exceptions, however, particularly\r\namong amateurs in Germany, sufficient to show that success is\r\npossible. The Baron de Bretton raises about 27,000 cocoons annually.\r\n\r\nIn this country but little has been done, or attempted, and that\r\nlittle has not been very successful.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, that _Yamamai_ is a difficult moth to rear in a country\r\nlike this, where in early spring the temperature varies so much; but\r\nthat success is possible, I am convinced.\r\n\r\nThe moth emerges from the cocoon in the latter part of the summer,\r\ncopulates, lays its eggs, and of course dies. And now the trouble\r\ncommences; that is, with eggs laid, say in Japan, from whence we\r\nmainly get our supplies.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the egg is laid, the young larva commences its formation,\r\nwhich in a short time (about one month) is perfected. It lies in the\r\negg in a quiescent state till early spring. If the egg remain in the\r\ncountry where it is laid, and is kept at a pretty even temperature,\r\nand free from damp, the caterpillar emerges in a healthy condition.\r\nBut if it be removed some thousands of miles, passing in the transit\r\nfrom heat to cold, and back to heat again: and if, in addition, it\r\nbe closely confined in a damp place, with little or no circulation of\r\nair, the egg is attacked by a fungus which sometimes prevents the worm\r\nfrom emerging at all; or, if it emerge, it is in a sickly condition.\r\nThat these conditions obtain in the transit of eggs, from Japan\r\nto Europe, and thence to America, is evident enough; and it may,\r\ntherefore, require the efforts of many persons, continued for a long\r\ntime, to enable us to acclimatize the _Yamamai_. But this is all that\r\nis required, and I feel confident that ultimate success is certain.\r\n\r\nOn hatching out, the worm is of a brimstone yellow, and thinly covered\r\nwith strong hairs; after the second month it is greenish, with black,\r\nlongitudinal streaks, and the thread a dull coral red color. After the\r\nthird month it becomes of a fine apple green, with yellow tubercles\r\non each segment, from which issue a few black hairs. The head and legs\r\nare chocolate brown, the prolegs reddish, and the first segment edged\r\nwith pinkish color. The greatest care is necessary, as the spring\r\nadvances, to prevent the eggs from hatching before the oak buds\r\nare ready for them, and the temperature must be regulated with the\r\ngreatest nicety. If the eggs can be kept somewhere about 50 deg. Fah.,\r\nit would be quite safe; higher than that the mercury should not be\r\nallowed to rise, till you are quite ready for the worms, and, on the\r\nother hand, the eggs should not be allowed to freeze.\r\n\r\nOn emerging from the eggs, the worms should be allowed either to crawl\r\nto the oak branches, or rather to sprigs obtained for that purpose,\r\nthe end of which should be placed in a jar, or bottle, of water, or\r\nthe worms may be placed on gently with a camel-hair brush. The leaves\r\nshould be well sprinkled with clean water that the caterpillars may\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\nFrom some cause, not well understood, the young caterpillars have\r\na tendency to wander; and if care be not taken many may be lost. To\r\nprevent this, it is well to cover the branches with a gauze bag, tied\r\ntightly around the stems, and close to the bottle. Care must also\r\nbe taken that the caterpillars do not find their way into the water,\r\nwhich they assuredly will if they have the opportunity, committing\r\nsuicide in the most reckless manner. If the number of caterpillars be\r\nfew, it is a good plan to place them at the outset with their food,\r\nin a wide-mouthed bottle, covering the mouth with gauze. The branches,\r\nparticularly if the weather be warm, must still be occasionally\r\nsprinkled, so that the caterpillars may have the opportunity of\r\ndrinking. It must be remembered that experiment is necessary in\r\nrearing _Yamamai_, but one thing is ascertained, and that is, that the\r\nworms must not be exposed to direct sunshine, at least not after seven\r\nor eight in the morning. If the spring be warm, I am inclined to think\r\nthat a northeastern exposure is the best, and we may sum up by saying,\r\nthat comparatively cool and moist seasons are more favorable to\r\nsuccess that hot, dry weather. In America the worms suffer in the\r\nearly spring, from the rapid changes of temperature, 40 deg. at 9 A.M.\r\nincreasing to 70 deg. in the afternoon and falling off to freezing point\r\nduring the night. The worms cannot stand this. They become torpid,\r\nrefuse to eat, and consequently die. To prevent this, if the nights\r\nbe cold, they must be placed where no such change of temperature can\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to say that an ample supply of fresh food\r\nmust be always supplied, but it may not be amiss to say that it is\r\nwell, when supplying fresh branches, to remove the worms from the old\r\nto the new. The best way of doing this is to clip off the branch, or\r\nleaf, on which the worm is resting, and tie, pin, or in some way affix\r\nthe same to the new branches. If this be not done, they will continue\r\nto eat the old leaf, even if it be withered, and this induces disease.\r\nIf the worm has fastened itself for the purpose of moulting, the best\r\nway is to remove the entire branch, clipping off all the dried\r\nleaves before so removing it. These remarks apply, in general, to the\r\ntreatment of all silkworms, except _Bombyx mori_.\r\n\r\nThe results of numerous experiments with _Yamamai_ go to show that it\r\nis, as I said before, a difficult worm to rear; but it has been reared\r\nnear New York to the extent of eight hundred cocoons out of sixteen\r\nhundred eggs, and this, although not a remunerative result, is\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese silk moth, _Aulterea Pernyi_, also an oak feeder, has been\r\nsuccessfully raised by me and by others, for several years. Eggs have\r\nbeen sold to persons in States widely separated, and the results show\r\nthat this worm is perfectly hardy.\r\n\r\nThe moth winters in the cocoon, emerges early in May, if the weather\r\nbe warm, pairs readily, and lays from 150 to 200 eggs. These hatch\r\nout in about fourteen days, and like _Yamamai_, always about 5 or 6\r\no'clock in the morning. It is necessary to be on the alert to catch\r\nthem on hatching only, and to remember that they are vagabonds, even\r\nto a greater extent than _Yamamai_. Consequently similar precautions\r\nmust be taken.\r\n\r\nThe worm on emerging from the egg is large, and of a chocolate-brown\r\ncolor. After the first month it becomes of a yellowish green; head,\r\npale brown; feet and prolegs of nearly the same color. The body has\r\nnumerous reddish tubercles, from which issue a few reddish hairs. At\r\nthe base of some of the tubercles on the anterior segments are silvery\r\npatches.\r\n\r\nThe _Pernyi_ worm is much more easily reared than that of _Yamamai_,\r\nbut still great care is needed; fresh food of course is essential, and\r\na slight sprinkling of the branches and worms in very warm weather is\r\nadvisable; although it is not so necessary as with _Yamamai_. It is\r\nremarkable that _Pernyi_ worms, fed in the open air, on oak trees,\r\ndo not, at present, thrive so well as those fed in-doors, but this,\r\ndoubtless, is a question of acclimation. I advise white oak (_Quercus\r\nalba_) as food, if it can be readily obtained, but failing that, pin\r\noak (_Quercus palustris_) will do; and I have no doubt that they will\r\nfeed on any kind of oak. They will, indeed, feed on birch, and on\r\nsweet gum (_Liquidambar_), but oak is the proper food. It is worthy of\r\nremark that _Pernyi_ bears a strong resemblance to our _Polyphemus_,\r\nbut it is more easily reared in confinement, and double brooded; an\r\nimportant fact for the silk culturist. From American reared eggs, I\r\nobtained cocoons as early as July 4th, the perfect insect emerging on\r\nJuly 31. Copulation immediately ensued, and the resulting eggs hatched\r\nonly on August 12, ten days only from the time of laying; and as the\r\nworm feeds up in about four or five weeks, this affords plenty of\r\ntime for rearing the second brood. It must be remembered that on the\r\nquantity and quality of food, much depends, not only with _Pernyi_\r\nbut with all caterpillars. By furnishing food sparingly the time of\r\nfeeding would be much prolonged.\r\n\r\nI have already said that both _Yamamai_ and _Pernyi_ should be fed\r\nunder shelter for the reasons given, but there is another reason of\r\nless importance. The young worms are liable to be attacked by spiders\r\nand wasps, and even after the second month, they are not safe from\r\nthese enemies. I have seen a wasp bite a large caterpillar in two,\r\ncarry off the anterior section and return for the posterior, which\r\nhad held on by its prolegs. Did the wasp anticipate this fact, and\r\ntherefore carry off the anterior part first? As to the spiders, they\r\nform a series of pulleys and hoist the caterpillar off its legs,\r\nsucking its juices at leisure.\r\n\r\nAnd now I must devote a few words to the advisability of silk culture\r\nfrom a pecuniary point of view. _Bombyx mori_, or the ordinary\r\nmulberry silkworm, is, of course, the best to rear, if you can obtain\r\nhealthy eggs. But this is the difficulty, and thence arises the\r\nnecessity of cultivating other silk-producing species. I imagine\r\nthat silk can be produced in most of the States of the Union, and\r\nmanufactured from the cocoon at a large profit; but for the present,\r\nwe will leave the manufacture out of the question, and consider only,\r\nwhether it will not pay to rear eggs and cocoons for sale? It must\r\nbe remembered that European manufacturers are at this moment largely\r\ndependent on foreign countries for the supply of both eggs and\r\ncocoons; and this, because of the general prevalence of disease among\r\nall the races of _Bombyx mori_. And now, to what extent does the\r\nreader suppose this dependence exists? Of cocoons I have no returns at\r\nhand, but, of raw silk, European manufacturers purchase, annually, not\r\nless than $160,000,000 worth; and of eggs (_Bombyx mori_) to the\r\nvalue of $10,000,000. This, then, is a business of no trifling amount.\r\nCalifornia seems to be alive to the fact, and, I am informed, raised,\r\nthis last season, $3,000,000 cocoons; and, for sale, about 4,000\r\nounces of eggs, worth at least $4 per ounce, wholesale. Now, there is\r\nno earthly reason why California should monopolize this business.\r\nWhy are not companies formed in other States for this purpose? or if\r\nprivate individuals lack the enterprise or the means, why do not the\r\nlegislatures, of those States most favorably located, do something by\r\nway of starting the business? A few thousand dollars loaned, or even\r\ndonated, may prove to be a valuable investment for the people at\r\nlarge, and, even supposing a failure, would not be a very great loss\r\nto any body.\r\n\r\nSo far as farmers are concerned, it may interest them to know that one\r\nman in England, Capt. Mason, clears $50 per acre by rearing silkworms\r\n(_Bombyx mori_ in this case), and I much doubt whether any crop raised\r\nhere pays as well.\r\n\r\nBy way of commencement, then, let everybody that has sufficient\r\nleisure set to work, and rear as many silkworms, of the above-named\r\nspecies, as he possibly can; and if the process be not remunerative in\r\na pecuniary sense, it most assuredly will be in the amount of pleasure\r\nand knowledge obtained.\r\n\r\nOne caution I must give to those who cultivate _Bombyx mori_. Although\r\n_Yamamai_ requires sprinkled branches, _Bombyx mori_ does not; nor\r\nmust the leaves be furnished to them while wet with rain or dew.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF COLD UPON IRON.--The article upon this subject, giving\r\nexperiments of Fairbairn and others, referred to in our editorial\r\nupon the same subject, in our last issue, was crowded out by press of\r\nmatter.

The machine herewith illustrated is manufactured\r\nby the same firm, and is a valuable addition to the many excellent\r\nwood-working machines now in use. A boring machine, though one of the\r\nsimplest, is by no means an unimportant adjunct to a full outfit of\r\nwood-working machines. The one shown in our engraving is one of the\r\nmost complete ever brought to our notice, and the great variety of\r\nwork it is capable of performing, renders the name chosen for it\r\npeculiarly applicable. It is called the \"Universal Boring Machine\"\r\nbecause the most prominent feature of its construction is its power to\r\nbore a hole in any desired angle with the axis of the bit.\r\n\r\nAny sized bit required is inserted into the chuck, which is adjustable\r\nto fit large and small shanks. The mandrel which carries the chuck is\r\nmade to traverse by a foot lever, so as to bore any depth up to twelve\r\ninches. The mandrel is driven by belt from a cone pulley of three\r\nfaces, which gives the proper speeds for different sized bits.\r\n\r\nSlots and stops upon the table enable the work to be set at any\r\ndesired angle on the horizontal plane, while the table can be set on\r\nan incline to any angle not exceeding forty-five degrees. The table\r\nis twenty-one inches wide, with fifteen inches slide, and it can be\r\nraised or lowered fifteen inches.\r\n\r\nThe countershaft rests in self-adjusting boxes, and has a tight and\r\na loose pulley eight inches in diameter. The traversing mandrel is of\r\nthe best quality of steel, and the machine is otherwise made of iron\r\nin a substantial manner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: McBETH, BENTEL, & MARGEDANT'S UNIVERSAL BORING\r\nMACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe several adjustments enable the operator to do all kinds of light\r\nand heavy boring, with ease and with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nThis machine was awarded the first premium at the Cincinnati\r\nIndustrial Exposition, in October, 1870, and was patented through the\r\nScientific American Patent Agency, Aug. 16, 1870. It is manufactured\r\nby McBeth, Bentel and Margedant, of Hamilton, Ohio, whom address for\r\nmachines rights to manufacture, or other information.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBINED TRUNK AND ROCKING CHAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nA unique invention, calculated to increase the comforts of travellers\r\non steamboats, ships, and in crowded rooms of hotels, is illustrated\r\nin the engraving published herewith. It is the invention of T. Nye,\r\nof Westbrook, Me., and was patented by him, June 18, 1867. It is a\r\ncombined trunk and rocking chair. The rockers are made to fold into\r\nrecesses, where they are retained by suitable appliances till wanted.\r\nThe trunk being opened, as shown, forms a back to the seat, which\r\nis held by metallic braces. When closed, the whole presents the\r\nappearance of an ordinary trunk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOSMETICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extensive use of preparations for hiding nature's bloom on the\r\nhuman countenance, and presenting to our view a sort of metallic\r\nplaster, suggests the inquiry, \"how are these pigments made?\" Without\r\ngoing into an unnecessary analysis of the \"Bloom of Youth,\" the\r\n\"Rejuvenator,\" the \"Corpse Decorator,\" or the other inventions for\r\ndestroying the skin, with which the druggists' stores abound, we\r\nmay state again the fact, always unheeded, that all the detestable\r\ncompounds are injurious. They are nearly all metallic poisons, and,\r\nif there be any that are innocent of this charge, they are in every\r\ninstance harmful to the health. The color and surface of the skin\r\ncannot be changed by any application which does not close the pores;\r\nthe pores, which are so exquisitely fine that there are millions of\r\nthem to the square inch, and which must be kept open if a healthy and\r\ncleanly body is to be preserved. There is more breathing done through\r\nthe pores of a healthy person than through the lungs; and we need not\r\nremind our readers of a ghastly piece of cruelty once enacted in Paris\r\n(that of gilding the body of a child, for a triumphal procession,\r\nwhich killed the subject in two hours), to show that the stoppage, in\r\nany degree, of the natural functions of so important an organ as the\r\nskin, is injurious. The immediate effect of the use of such compounds\r\nis to destroy the vitality of the skin, and to render it, in\r\nappearance, a piece of shriveled parchment. We must warn our readers\r\nthat a temporary and meretricious \"bloom\" can only be attained at the\r\ncost of future freshness and lively appearance, so that a year or two\r\nof \"looking like paint\" is followed by a long period of \"looking like\r\ndilapidation.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMITH'S INFANT DINING CHAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe accompanying engraving illustrates a convenient and cheap infant\r\ndining chair, which can be attached to any of the ordinary chairs in\r\ncommon use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt consists of a chair without legs, suspended by the posts of the\r\nback, as shown, on pins engaging with hooked bars, which are placed\r\nupon the back of an ordinary chair. The details of the device will be\r\nseen by a glance at the engraving. The chair is adjusted in hight\r\nby placing the pins in the proper holes in the posts made for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nFor further information, address Smith, Hollenbeck & Co., Toledo,\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MEDICINES OF THE ANCIENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the recent commencement of the Homeopathic College in this city,\r\nMr. S. H. Wales, of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN addressed the graduating\r\nclass, and from his remarks, we quote the following:\r\n\r\n\"Many writers of our time persist in regarding this, above all others,\r\nas the best period in the history of our race; and, doubtless, it is\r\ntrue in many important respects. But I cannot forbear the suggestion\r\nat this moment that there was a time in the history of the world\r\nwhen the science of medicine was unknown, when people lived to the\r\nincredible age of many centuries; and, even after the span of life\r\nhad been reduced to threescore and ten, sickness was comparatively\r\nunknown. In ancient times, it was looked upon as a calamity, that\r\nhad overtaken a tribe or people, when one of its members prematurely\r\nsickened and died.\r\n\r\n\"Other arts and sciences flourished in Rome long before medicine\r\nwas thought of; and the historian tells us that the first doctor who\r\nsettled in Rome, some two hundred years before Christ, was banished on\r\naccount of his poor success and the very severe treatment applied to\r\nhis patients; and it was a hundred years before the next one came. He\r\nrose to great popularity, simply because he allowed his patients to\r\ndrink all the wine they wanted, and to eat their favorite dishes.\r\nSome writer on hygiene has made the statement that the whole code\r\nof medical ethics presented by Moses consisted simply in bathing,\r\npurification, and diet. This simplicity of life was not confined to\r\nthe wandering tribes who settled in the land of Canaan, but was the\r\nuniversal custom of all nations of which history gives us any account.\r\nThis simple arrangement for health was considered enough in those\r\nprimitive times, when the human system had not been worn out and\r\nexhausted by depletive medicines. The luxuries of public baths,\r\nathletic sports and games were deemed ample, both to educate the\r\nphysical perceptions and to prevent disease.\r\n\r\n\"All this wisdom, which had its origin in ancient games and sports\r\nof the field, led to the erection of extensive bath-houses, and the\r\nadoption of other healthful luxuries to which all the people could\r\nresort to recreate their wasted powers.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARNES' VENTILATOR FOR MATTRESSES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany diseases are caused by the use of beds not properly aired; and\r\nit is difficult, if not impossible, to properly air, or ventilate,\r\na mattress, made in the usual manner. If this could be done more\r\nthoroughly than it generally is, much sickness would be avoided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo secure this object cheaply and efficiently is the design of the\r\ninvention herewith illustrated. By it a complete circulation of\r\nair through the mattress is secured, which carries off all dampness\r\narising from constant use. Thus the mattress becomes more healthy for\r\nsleeping purposes, more durable and better fitted for the sick room.\r\nThe ventilators consist of coiled wire, covered with coarse cloth\r\n(to prevent the stuffing closing up the tube), running through the\r\nmattress in all directions. The ends of the coils are secured to the\r\nticking by means of metal thimbles, inside of which are pieces of wire\r\ngauze, to prevent insects getting in, but which admit air freely. The\r\ncost of the ventilators is small, and they will last as long as any\r\nmattress. They can be applied to any bed at small expense.\r\n\r\nThis invention was patented through the Scientific American Patent\r\nAgency, January 10, 1871. The right to manufacture will be disposed\r\nof in any part of the country. Further information can be obtained by\r\naddressing the proprietors, Barnes & Allen, Hoosick Falls, N.

The article in question\r\nis a curiosity in literature. It deserves a much wider circulation\r\nthan _Engineering_ can give it, and we would gladly transfer it to our\r\ncolumns, but for its exceeding length--a serious fault generally, not\r\nonly with _Engineering's_ articles, but most other technical journals\r\npublished in England. It would scarcely do for them to be brief in\r\ntheir discussions, and above all other things, spice and piquancy\r\nmust always be excluded. _Engineering_ evidently labors under the\r\nconviction that the heavier it can make its discussions, the more\r\nprofoundly will it be able to impress its readers. Hence, we are\r\nequally astonished and gratified to find a gleam of humor flashing out\r\nfrom the ordinary sober-sided composition of our learned contemporary.\r\nThe article came to us just as we were laboring under an attack of\r\ndyspepsia, and its reading fairly shook our atrabilious _corpus_. We\r\nsaid to ourselves, \"can it be possible that _Engineering_ is about to\r\nexperience the new birth, to undergo regeneration, and a baptism of\r\nfire?\" The article is really worth reading, and we begin to indulge\r\nthe hope that at least one English technical is going to try to make\r\nitself not only useful, but readable and interesting. And what is\r\nmost perplexingly novel in this new manifestation, is the display of\r\na considerable amount of egotism, which we had always supposed to be\r\na sinful and naughty thing in technical journalism. And, as if to\r\nmagnify this self-complaisance, it actually alludes to its \"_own\r\nextensive and ever-increasing circulation in America_.\" Now to show\r\nhow small a thing can impart comfort to the soul of our cotemporary,\r\nwe venture to say that the circulation of _Engineering_ in this\r\ncountry cannot much exceed three hundred copies per week.\r\n\r\nIt evidently amazes our English cotemporary that a journal like the\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, which, according to its own notions, is chiefly\r\nthe work of \"scissors and paste,\" should circulate so widely; and it\r\neven belittles our weekly circulation by several thousand copies,\r\nin order to give point to its very amusing, and, we will also add,\r\ngenerally just criticism.\r\n\r\nThe writer in _Engineering_, whoever he may be, appears to be a sort\r\nof literary Rip Van Winkle, just waking out of a long sleep; and\r\nhe cannot get the idea through his head that it is possible that a\r\ntechnical journal can become a vehicle of popular information to\r\nthe mass of mankind, instead of being the organ of a small clique of\r\nprofessional engineers or wealthy manufacturers, such as seems to\r\nhold control of the columns of _Engineering_, and who use it either\r\nto ventilate their own pet schemes and theories, or to advertise, by\r\nillustration and otherwise, in the reading columns, a repetition of\r\nlathes, axle-boxes brakes, cars, and other trade specialities, which\r\ncan lay little or no claim to novelty. It is, furthermore, a crying\r\nsin in the estimation of our English critic that American technical\r\njournals do not separate their advertisements from the subject matter;\r\nand he thinks that when Yankee editors learn that trade announcements\r\nare out of place in the body of a journal, they will see how to make\r\ntheir journals pay by making them higher priced. Now we venture to\r\nsay, without intending to give offence, that Yankee editors understand\r\ntheir business quite as well as do English editors; and it is\r\npresumable, at least, that they know what suits their readers on\r\nthis side, much better than do English editors. We venture to\r\nsuggest--modestly, of course--that journalism in the two countries\r\nis not the same, and should the editor of _Engineering_ undertake\r\nto transfer his system of intellectual labor to this side of the\r\nAtlantic, he would not be long in making the discovery that those\r\nwandering Bohemian engineers, who, he tells us, are in sorrow and\r\nheaviness over the short-comings of American technical journals, would\r\nturn out after all to be slender props for him to lean upon. We think\r\nit probable, however, that with a little more snap, a journal like\r\n_Engineering_ might possibly attain a circulation, in this country, of\r\n500 or 1000 copies weekly.\r\n\r\nWhy, American engineers have scarcely yet been able to organize\r\nthemselves into an association for mutual advancement in their\r\nprofession, much less to give the reading public the benefit of their\r\nexperience and labors! This fact alone ought, of itself, to satisfy\r\n_Engineering_ that no such journal could profitably exist in this\r\ncountry. Whenever our American engineers are ready to support such a\r\njournal, there will be no difficulty in finding a publisher.\r\n\r\n_Engineering_, in its casual reference to the various technical\r\njournals of America, omits to name our leading scientific monthly, but\r\nintroduces with just commendation a venerable cotemporary, now upwards\r\nof three score years of age. Now, it is no disparagement of this\r\nreally modest monthly to say, that perhaps there are not sixty hundred\r\npeople in the States who know it, even by name; and so far as the use\r\nof \"scissors and paste\" are made available in our technical journals,\r\nwe venture the assertion that the editorial staff expenses of the\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN are as great, if not greater, than those of\r\n_Engineering_. The question, however, is not so much one of original\r\noutlay, but which of the two journals gives most for the money. In\r\nthis very essential particular, and with no intention to depreciate\r\nthe value of _Engineering_, we assert, with becoming modesty, that the\r\nSCIENTIFIC AMERICAN occupies a position which _Engineering_ will never\r\nbe able to attain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHERMAN PROCESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen people boast of extraordinary successes in processes the details\r\nof which are kept profoundly hidden from public scrutiny, and when the\r\nevidences of success are presented in the doubtful form of specimens\r\nwhich the public has no means of tracing directly to the process, the\r\npublic is apt to be skeptical, and to express skepticism often in not\r\nvery complimentary terms.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time, the public has been treated to highly-colored\r\naccounts of a wonderful metallurgic process whereby the best iron and\r\nsteel were said to be made, from the very worst materials, almost\r\nin the twinkling of an eye. This process has been called after its\r\nassumed inventor, or discoverer, the \"Sherman Process.\" The details of\r\nthe process are still withheld, but we last week gave an extract from\r\nan English contemporary, which throws a little light upon the subject.\r\n\r\nThe agent relied upon to effect the remarkable transformation claimed,\r\nis iodine, used preferably in the form of iodide of potassium, and\r\nvery little of it is said to produce a most marvellous change in the\r\ncharacter of the metal.\r\n\r\nA very feeble attempt at explaining the rationale of this effect has\r\nbeen made, in one or two English journals, which we opine will not\r\nprove very satisfactory to chemists and scientific metallurgists. The\r\n_Engineer_ has published two three-column articles upon the subject,\r\nthe first containing very little information, and the second a great\r\nnumber of unnecessary paragraphs, but which gives the proportion of\r\nthe iodide used, in the extremely scientific and accurate formula\r\nexpressed in the terms \"a small quantity.\"\r\n\r\nAssertions of remarkable success have also been given. Nothing,\r\nhowever, was said of remarkable failures, of which there have\r\ndoubtless been some. A series of continued successes would, we\r\nshould think, by this time, have sufficed for the parturition of\r\nthis metallurgic process, and the discovery would ere this have been\r\nintroduced to the world, had there not been some drawbacks.\r\n\r\nWe are not prepared to deny _in toto_ that the process is all that is\r\nclaimed for it; but the way in which it has been managed is certainly\r\none not likely to encourage faith in it.\r\n\r\nThe very name of \"process\" implies a system perfected, and if it be\r\nstill so far back in the experimental stage that nothing definite in\r\nthe way of results can be relied upon, it is not yet a process. If, in\r\nthe use of iodine, in some instances, fine grades of iron or steel are\r\nproduced, and in as many other experiments, with the same material,\r\nfailures result, it is just as fair to attribute the failures to the\r\niodine, as the successes. A process worthy the name is one that acts\r\nwith approximate uniformity, and when, in its use, results vary\r\nwidely from what is usual, the variation may be traced to important\r\ndifferences in the conditions of its application.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we are inclined to believe Mr. Sherman's experiments\r\nhave not yet developed a definite process, and we shall receive with\r\nmuch allowance the glowing statements published in regard to it, until\r\nsuch time as it can face the world and defy unbelief.\r\n\r\nThe patents obtained by Mr. Sherman seem to cover the use of iodine,\r\nrather than the manner of using it, and throw no light upon the\r\nrationale of the process.\r\n\r\nA patent was granted by the United States Patent Office, Sept. 13,\r\n1870, to J. C. Atwood, in which the inventor claims the use of iodide\r\nof potassium in connection with the carbons and fluxes used in making\r\nand refining iron. In his specification he states that he uses about\r\n_fifteen grains_ of this salt to eighty pounds of the metal. This\r\nis about 1/373 of one per cent. He uses in connection with this\r\nexceedingly small proportion of iodide of potassium, about two ounces\r\nof lampblack, or charcoal, and four ounces of manganese, and asserts\r\nthat steel made with these materials will be superior in quality\r\nto that made by the old method. These claims we are inclined to\r\ndiscredit. Certainly, we see no chemical reason why this small amount\r\nof iodide should produce such an effect, and the specification itself\r\nthrows no light upon our darkness.\r\n\r\nIf the experiments in these so-called processes have no better basis\r\nthan is apparent from such information as at present can be gathered\r\nrespecting them, it is probable we shall wait some time before the\r\npromised revolution in iron and steel manufacture is accomplished\r\nthrough their use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRUBBER TIRES FOR TRACTION ENGINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen it was first discovered that a smooth-faced driving wheel,\r\nrunning on a smooth-faced rail, would \"bite,\" the era of iron railways\r\nand locomotive engines may be said to have fairly commenced. The\r\ncorrection of a single radical error was, in this case, the dawn of a\r\nnew system of travel, so extensive in its growth and marvelous in its\r\nresults, that even the wildest dreamer could not, at that time, have\r\nimagined the consequences of so simple a discovery.\r\n\r\nA popular and somewhat similar error regarding the bite of wheels on\r\nrough and uneven surfaces, has also prevailed. We say popular error,\r\nbecause engineers have not shared it, and it has obtained, to any\r\nnotable extent, only among those unfamiliar with mechanical science.\r\nThe error in question is, that hard-surfaced wheels will not bite on\r\na moderately rough surface, sufficiently to give an efficient tractile\r\npower. It seems strange that this error should have diffused itself\r\nvery extensively, when it is remembered that a certain degree of\r\nroughness is essential to frictional resistance. The smoothness of the\r\nordinary railway track is roughness compared to that of an oiled or\r\nunctuous metallic surface; and it has been amply demonstrated that\r\nthe resistance of friction, of two bearing surfaces depends, not\r\nupon their extent, but upon the pressure with which they are forced\r\ntogether. A traction wheel, of given weight, resting upon two square\r\ninches of hard earth or rock, would develop the same tractile power\r\nas though it had a bearing surface of two square feet of similar\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nOn very rough and stony ways, however, another element practically of\r\nno importance on moderately rough ways, like a macadam surface or a\r\nconcrete road, where the prominences are nearly of uniform hight, and\r\nso near together as to admit between their summits only very small\r\narcs of the circumference of the wheel; comes into action. This\r\nelement is the constantly recurring lifting of the superincumbent\r\nweight of the machine. Even this would not result in loss of power,\r\ncould the power developed in falling be wholly applied to useful work\r\nin the direction of the advance of the engine. The fact is, however,\r\nthat it is not so applied, and in any method of propulsion at present\r\nknown to engineering science, cannot be so applied. Above a certain\r\npoint where friction enough is developed to prevent slip, the more\r\nuneven the road surface is, the greater the power demanded for the\r\npropulsion of the locomotive. And this will hold good for both hard\r\nand soft-tired wheels.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the advantage, if any, of rubber-tired wheels? The\r\nadvantages claimed may be enumerated as follows: increased tractile\r\npower, with a given weight, secured without damage to roadways; ease\r\nof carriage to the supported machinery, whereby it--the machinery--is\r\nsaved from stress and wear; and economy of the power, expended in\r\nmoving the extra weight required by rigid-tired wheels, to secure the\r\nrequired frictional resistance. The last-mentioned claim depends upon\r\nthe first, and must stand or fall with it. The saving of roadway,\r\nease of carriage, and its favorable result upon the machinery, are\r\ngenerally conceded.\r\n\r\nA denial of the first claim has been made, by those interested in the\r\nmanufacture of rigid-tired traction engines and others, in so far\r\nas the rubber tires are employed on comparatively smooth surfaces;\r\nalthough the increased tractile power on quite _rough_ pavements and\r\nroads is acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThis denial is based upon results of experiments performed on the\r\nstreets of Rochester, England, between the 9th October and the 2nd\r\nNovember, 1870, by a committee of the Royal Engineers (British Army),\r\nwith a view to determine accurately the point in question.\r\n\r\nCare was taken to make the circumstances, under which the trials\r\ntook place, exactly alike for both the rubber and the iron tires. The\r\nexperiments were performed with an Aveling and Porter six-horse power\r\nroad engine, built in the Royal Engineers' establishment. The weight\r\nof the engine, without rubber tires, was 11,225 pounds; with rubber\r\ntires, it weighed 12,025 pounds. Without rubber tires it drew 2.813\r\ntimes its own weight up a gradient of 1 in 11; with rubber\r\ntires, it drew up the same incline 2.763 times the weight of engine,\r\nwith the weight of rubber tires added; showing that, although it drew\r\na little over 2,200 pounds more than it could do without the rubber\r\ntires, the increase of traction was only that which might be expected\r\nfrom the additional weight.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed, moreover, that the additional traction power and\r\nsuperior ease of carriage on rough roads, secured with rubber tires,\r\nis dearly bought at the very great increase in cost, of an engine\r\nfitted with them, over one not so fitted.\r\n\r\nThis is a point we regard as not fully settled, though it will not\r\nlong remain in doubt. There are enough of both types of wheels now in\r\nuse to soon answer practically any question there may be of durability\r\n(upon which the point of economy hinges), so far as the interest on\r\nthe increased cost due to rubber tires, is offset against the greater\r\nwear and tear of iron rimmed wheels. It is stated, on good authority\r\nthat a rubber tired engine, started at work in Aberdeen, Scotland,\r\nwore out its tires between April and September, inclusive, and when\r\nit is taken into consideration, that the cost of these tires is\r\nabout half that of other engines, made with solid iron rimmed driving\r\nwheels, it will be seen that, unless very much greater durability than\r\nthis can be shown for the rubber, the advantages of such tires are\r\nvery nearly, if not more than, balanced by their disadvantages.\r\n\r\nThe fact that one set of tires wore out so soon does not prove a rule.\r\nThere may have been causes at work which do not affect such tires\r\ngenerally, and it would be, we think, quite premature to form\r\nfavorable or unfavorable judgment, of relative economy from such data\r\nas have been yet furnished.\r\n\r\nThe difference in the current expenses of running the two most\r\nprominent types of engines, with hard and soft tires, now in use, does\r\nnot affect the question of rubber tires, unless it can be shown that\r\nthese tires necessitate, _per se_, such a form of engine as requires\r\na greater consumption of fuel, and greater cost of attendance, to\r\nperform a given amount of work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCENTRAL SHAFT OF THE HOOSAC TUNNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs many of our readers have evinced much interest and ingenuity on\r\nthe question of the propriety of placing reliance upon the accuracy of\r\ndropping a perpendicular from the top to the bottom of a shaft 1,030\r\nfeet in depth, by means of an ordinary plummet, we take the earliest\r\nopportunity of settling the matter beyond dispute, by reporting\r\nthe results lately obtained, through a series of experiments by the\r\nengineers in charge, for the ultimate purpose of laying down the\r\ncorrect line for the tunnel.\r\n\r\nThe perpendicular line has, of course, been dropped many times, and\r\nthe main result taken. The plummet used is made of steel, properly\r\nbalanced and polished, in shape something like a pineapple, and of\r\nabout the same size, weighing fifteen pounds. It was suspended, with\r\nthe large end downwards, by a thin copper wire, one fortieth of an\r\ninch in diameter, immersed in water; and, after careful steadying with\r\nthe hand, occupied about an hour in assuming its final position or\r\nmotion, which, contrary to the expectation and theories of many,\r\nresulted in a circular motion around a fixed point, the diameter of\r\nthe circle being a mean of one quarter of an inch. The suspending\r\nwire in these operations was not quite the entire length of the shaft,\r\nbeing only 900 feet; and before the plummet had settled, the wire had\r\nstretched nearly twenty feet.\r\n\r\nThe suspension of the plummet in water was not considered necessary\r\nfor any other reason than that water was continually trickling down\r\nthe wire, and dropping on the plummet. The experiments so far have\r\nnot been of the perfect character it is determined to attain, when the\r\nfinal alignment is made, as, until the headings east and west of the\r\nshaft have advanced to a considerable distance, any slight error would\r\nbe of no account.\r\n\r\nA neat and ingenious instrument has been constructed for determining\r\nthe variation of the plummet, and will be used when great accuracy is\r\ndesired; the plummet will also be suspended in oil.\r\n\r\nThe bearing of the tunnel is about S. 81 deg. E.; but, independently of\r\nits near approach to the line of revolution described by the earth,\r\nit is not considered necessary to take into account any motion it may\r\nderive from this cause. In fact, the opinion is, that the motion of\r\nthe earth will not practically have any effect.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, after the still imperfect experiments which have been\r\nmade, enough is established to show there is no difficulty to be\r\nencountered, other than the accurate and delicate manipulation of the\r\nplummet and its attachments.\r\n\r\nThe shaft headings are progressing favorably. The rock is not so hard\r\nor varied as that met with at the west end markings. Already nearly\r\n300 feet have been taken out, and with the proved energy of the\r\ncontractors, this great task will doubtless be prosecuted steadily and\r\nsurely to completion, within the contract time expiring March 1, 1874.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MUSEUM OF ART AND NATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur recent articles on \"Scientific Destitution in New York\" and \"The\r\nScientific Value of the Central Park,\" have called forth numerous\r\nletters from correspondents, and have been extensively noticed by the\r\npress. We now learn that the legislature of the State has taken\r\nthe matter in hand, and there is some prospect, with an honest\r\nadministration of the appropriations, of something being done to\r\nrelieve our city of the opprobrium that rests upon it. A bill is\r\npending, before the Senate, authorizing the Park Commissioners to\r\nbuild, equip, and furnish, on Manhattan Square, or any other public\r\nsquare or park, suitable fire-proof buildings, at a cost not exceeding\r\n$500,000 for each corporation, for the purpose of establishing a\r\nmuseum of art, by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and of a museum\r\nof natural history, by the American Museum of Natural History, two\r\nsocieties recently incorporated by the Legislature. This is a million\r\ndollars to begin with, and an ample site, without cost, to the\r\naforementioned corporations.\r\n\r\nManhattan Square extends from Seventy-seventh to Eighty-first streets,\r\nand from Eighth to Ninth avenues, and spans about eighteen acres.\r\nUntil it was set apart by the state Board of Commissioners, for the\r\npurposes of a Zoological Garden, it was proposed, by a number of\r\nenlightened citizens of New York, to devote it to the uses of four of\r\nour existing corporations, giving to each one a corner, and an equal\r\nshare in the allotment of space. The societies were, \"the Academy of\r\nDesign,\" for art, \"the Historical Society,\" for public records and\r\nlibraries, \"the Lyceum of Natural History,\" for science, and \"the\r\nAmerican Institute,\" for technology. These have been incorporated\r\nfor many years, and are known to include the leading artists, men\r\nof letters, science, and the arts, of the city, on their lists of\r\nmembers. The committee went so far as to have plans of the building\r\ndrawn by competent architects; but, like many other well-meant\r\nschemes, want of money compelled the originators of the plan to\r\nabandon any further attempts. In the meantime, the Legislature\r\nchartered the American Botanical and Zoological Society, and gave the\r\nCommissioners of the Park authority to set apart a portion of it,\r\nnot exceeding sixty acres, for the use of the Society, for the\r\nestablishment of a zoological and botanical garden. This society\r\nwas duly organized under the act, and Mr. Hamilton Fish was made\r\nits president, and considerable sums of money were subscribed. But,\r\naccording to the sixth annual report of the Board of Commissioners,\r\n\"the society never manifested its desire for an allotment of ground.\"\r\nIt appears to have died, and made no sign. Some of our citizens,\r\nfearing that the Central Park would go the way of every other public\r\nwork in the city, made strenuous effort to revive the Zoological\r\nSociety, for the purpose of obtaining a perpetual lease of a suitable\r\nsite, on which to establish a zoological garden, similar to those in\r\nLondon, Paris, Amsterdam, and Cologne. Their object was to remove this\r\npart of the Park beyond the reach of political intrigue. Subsequent\r\nevents have shown that the fears of these gentlemen were well founded.\r\nThe Legislature of the State, on the 25th of March, 1862, gave ample\r\npowers to the New York Historical Society to establish a Museum of\r\nAntiquity and Science, and a Gallery of Art, in the Central Park.\r\nThey have submitted designs for a building, but, for some reason, no\r\ndecisive steps have been taken towards its construction.\r\n\r\nThe Lyceum of Natural History was also negotiating with the\r\nCommissioners, for the use of the upper rooms of the arsenal for its\r\ncollections, and there is no doubt that an arrangement to this\r\neffect would have been made, if a fire had not destroyed the entire\r\ncollections of the Lyceum. The Lyceum made great effort to raise money\r\nto purchase a new collection, but without avail; and, although this\r\nis the oldest scientific society in New York, and has inrolled in its\r\nlist of members, nearly every professional scientist of the city, it\r\nis probably the poorest, in income and resources, of any academy of\r\nsciences in the world. We do not know that the Academy of Design has\r\never applied for a home in the Central Park; and we cannot speak for\r\nthe American Institute, nor for the Geographical Society, in this\r\nparticular. As we stated in our former article, the old Board of\r\nCommissioners appears to have become weary of the unsuccessful\r\nattempts on the part of numerous societies to divide up and apportion\r\nthe Central Park, and they applied to the Legislature for authority to\r\nconduct matters in their own way. An act was duly passed, authorizing\r\nthe Board \"to erect, establish, conduct, and maintain, on the Central\r\nPark, a Meteorological and Astronomical Observatory, a Museum of\r\nNatural History, and a Gallery of Art, and the buildings therefor, and\r\nto provide the necessary instruments, furniture, and equipments for\r\nthe same.\"\r\n\r\nHere would seem to be ample power for the establishment of museums of\r\nscience and art, but nothing is said about the manner of raising the\r\nmoney. One would suppose, however, that, by means of the \"Central Park\r\nImprovement Fund,\" abundant means could have been raised. The bill\r\nnow before the Legislature puts matters in a new light. If it does not\r\nconflict with previous enactments, nor destroy vested rights, it has\r\nthe appearance of being a thoroughly practical way of solving the\r\nquestion of art and science for the city. The Metropolitan Museum of\r\nArt and the American Museum of Natural History are in the hands of\r\nthe most respectable citizens of New York. It would not be possible to\r\nfind a body of men of more unimpeachable integrity and greater\r\nworth, than the gentlemen who have founded these two societies. It is\r\nimpossible that they should lend their names to anything that will\r\nnot bear the closest scrutiny; hence the proposition, now before the\r\nLegislature, to put up buildings for them, at a cost of a million\r\ndollars, must attract unusual attention. If the State would\r\nappropriate the money to these corporations, giving them the control\r\nof its expenditure, we should have considerably more confidence in its\r\nhonest administration than, we are grieved to say, we can feel under\r\nthe present circumstances; and if we knew what other institutions\r\nare to have the remaining portions of Manhattan Square, it would be a\r\ngreat relief to our minds.\r\n\r\n\"We fear the Greeks bringing gifts,\" but are willing to accept the\r\ngifts, if the officers of the two organizations are certain that it is\r\nall right.\r\n\r\nThe need of a Museum of Natural History, and of a Gallery of Art, in\r\nNew York, is so pressing that there is some danger of our accepting\r\nthe appropriations without a proper regard to consequences. The Court\r\nHouse is not yet finished, and the foundations of the Post-office are\r\nscarcely laid.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF THE JUDGES OF GROUP 1, DEPARTMENT V. OF THE EXHIBITION OF\r\nTHE AMERICAN INSTITUTE FOR 1870. THE ALLEN ENGINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe labors of the judges in this department were much lighter in the\r\nlast exhibition than in the preceding one, and we are happy to say,\r\nwere, in our opinion, so far as the award of premiums is concerned,\r\nmuch more fairly performed. The award of two first premiums to two\r\ncompeting engines could scarcely be repeated this time, as there was\r\nin reality no competition. The Allen engine was the only important\r\none entered, and of course received the first premium. The engine is,\r\nhowever, one that evidently could have competed favorably with those\r\npreviously exhibited.\r\n\r\nWe are in receipt of advanced sheets of the judges' report pertaining\r\nto the critical examination of this engine, being a record and account\r\nof experiments performed under the supervision of Washington Lee, C. E.\r\nThe experiments were very comprehensive, and comprised approved tests,\r\nof each important detail, usually made by expert engineers.\r\n\r\nThe report is too voluminous for reprint or even for condensation\r\nin our columns. In looking it through, we are satisfied that the\r\nexperiments were accurately made, and that the engine exhibited great\r\nworking efficiency and economy.\r\n\r\nAs the engine has been recently illustrated and described in our\r\ncolumns, we deem it unnecessary to dwell upon the details of its\r\nconstruction. The water test of the previous exhibition was employed,\r\nthe water being this time measured, with indisputable accuracy, in a\r\ntank, instead of by a meter as before.\r\n\r\nThe voluminous comparison of this engine with those previously\r\nexhibited, seems unnecessary, and we think not in good taste in such a\r\nreport, however much it may possess of scientific interest. Moreover,\r\nthe circumstances under which the trials were respectively performed,\r\nrender the comparison difficult, if not unfair.\r\n\r\nMr. Lee concludes his report with a thorough endorsement of the theory\r\nof Mr. Porter upon the action of the reciprocating parts of engines,\r\nas set forth by the last named gentleman in recent articles in this\r\njournal. He says:\r\n\r\n\"Under the resistance of 128.375 horse powers at the brake, the motion\r\nof the engine was remarkably uniform; not the least diminution of\r\nspeed in passing the centers could be detected, illustrating very\r\nsatisfactorily the value, in this respect, of the speed employed, and\r\nof the action of the reciprocating parts of the engine in equalizing\r\nthe rotative pressure on the crank through the stroke. The governor\r\nwas, during the trials and through the exhibition, nearly motionless,\r\nwhile the load remained constant, and instantaneous in its action on\r\nchanges of resistance, maintaining a steadiness of running which left\r\nnothing to be desired.\"\r\n\r\nThe judges--Prof. F. A. P. Barnard, Thos. J. Sloan, and Robert\r\nWeir--speak in their report as follows:\r\n\r\n\"The performance of this engine has exceeded that of the two fine\r\nengines which were on trial here last year. The results seem to be\r\nwithout precedent in such engines. The engine ran from 11 to 12\r\nhours repeatedly without showing a sign of a warm bearing, displaying\r\nthorough perfection in all its parts. In all respects the engine is\r\nfirst-class, and from the fact of its presenting weight with speed, as\r\na requisite for perfection in steam engines, it has opened a new era\r\nin this necessary branch--its economy having been clearly demonstrated\r\nin the careful trials, which ought to be published in full.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLYCEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was an unusually large attendance of members at the meeting of\r\nthe Lyceum of Natural History, on Monday evening, the 6th inst.,\r\nto listen to an address by Professor B. Waterhouse Hawkins, on the\r\nprogress of the work of the restoration of the forms of extinct\r\nanimals in the Central Park. Mr. Hawkins gave an account of the\r\ndifficulties he encountered at the outset, in finding any skeletons\r\nof animals in New York, with which to make comparisons, and he was\r\nfinally compelled to go to Boston and Philadelphia for this purpose.\r\nAfter much study and many delays, the casts of the _Hadrosaurus_ were\r\ncompleted, and numerous smaller skeletons prepared. At this stage of\r\nthe proceedings an entire change in the administration of the Park\r\ntook place, and the newly appointed Commissioners decided to suspend\r\nthe work upon the Palaeozoic Museum, and they dismissed Mr. Hawkins\r\nfrom their service.\r\n\r\nThe announcement that an end had thus been summarily put to one of the\r\nmost important educational projects ever started in this country, was\r\nreceived by the Lyceum with profound surprise. For a few minutes after\r\nthe close of Mr. Hawkins' report, no one felt disposed to make any\r\ncomment, but as the truth of the great damage became apparent, there\r\nwas considerable disposition manifested to have the Society give\r\nexpression to its sense of the value of Mr. Hawkins' services in the\r\ncause of education, and their regret that so important a work should\r\nbe suspended at this critical period. Remarks were made by Dr.\r\nNewbery, Professor Joy, Mr. Andrew H. Green, Professor Seely, Dr.\r\nWalz, Mr. E. G. Squier, and others, and the following resolutions were\r\nunanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the Lyceum of Natural History, in the city of New\r\n  York, has learned with deep regret of the temporary suspension\r\n  of the work of restoration of the forms of extinct animals,\r\n  as hitherto prosecuted in the Central Park, under the able\r\n  superintendence of Professor Waterhouse Hawkins.\r\n\r\n  _Resolved_, That the Society considers the proposed palaeozoic\r\n  museum not only a valuable acquisition to the scientific treasures\r\n  and resources of the city, but also as a most important adjunct\r\n  and complement to our great system of public education.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWARMING AND VENTILATION OF RAILROAD CARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere has been enough of denunciation against the present general\r\nmethod of warming and ventilating railway cars. It produces no effect\r\non the corporations who could, if they would, adopt appliances that\r\nwould not burn people to death in cases of accident, nor regularly and\r\npersistently poison them with bad air.\r\n\r\nThere is no lack of ways and means; the problem is simple and easily\r\nsolved; nay--a not very extensive search through the Patent Office\r\nrecords will show that it has been solved already; perhaps not in the\r\nmost practical and perfect manner, but still solved so well, as, were\r\nit not for corporation cupidity, would greatly add to the comfort and\r\nsafety of passengers.\r\n\r\nThe real problem is how to compel corporations to recognize the\r\nfact that the public has rights they are bound to respect. It is the\r\ndisregard of these rights that fills our cars with smoke, dust, and\r\nexhalations, and puts box stoves full of hot coals in the corners,\r\nready to cook the human stew whenever a frisky car shall take a\r\nnotion to turn a somersault. The invention needed is a conscience for\r\ncorporations--an invention, by the way, scarcely less difficult\r\nthan the one advertised for in our last issue, namely, a plan for\r\npreventing the sale of intoxicating liquors and tobacco in New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe _Railroad Gazette_, imitating the English ideal of prolixity in\r\ndiscussion, for which _Engineering_ has recently patted it on the\r\nback approvingly, treats us, in its issue of February 11th, to a page\r\narticle, to be continued, under the title of \"Warming and Ventilation\r\nof Railroad Cars.\" In this article the writer takes the ground that\r\npeople in general are ignorant of the effects of pure air, and not\r\nbeing able to \"see the foulness,\" they \"therefore do not believe\r\nit exists.\" It is quite possible they may not be able to see the\r\nfoulness, but if in the majority of railroad cars run in this country,\r\nthey are not able to feel it in gritty, grimy accumulations on skin\r\nand linen, and smell it in suffocating stenches which serve, with\r\nsneeze-provoking dust, to stifle anything like comfort, their skin\r\nmust be thicker, their linen more neglected, and their noses less\r\nsensitive than those of the majority of fellow travellers it has been\r\nour fortune to be cooped up with for a day's railroad journey.\r\n\r\nThe _Railroad Gazette_ makes this wholesale charge of ignorance\r\nand insensibility the excuse for an essay on the physiology of\r\nrespiration, mostly extracted from Huxley's \"Elementary Lessons in\r\nPhysiology,\" and therefore excellent in its way, though having a\r\nsomewhat remote bearing upon the subject as announced in the title of\r\nthe article. We trust that before this journal concludes its series of\r\narticles thus commenced, it will tell how to breathe into the breasts\r\nof the corporations which choke us in their human packing boxes,\r\nsomething resembling the soul which they are universally acknowledged\r\nto be destitute of. When this is done, carbonic acid, ammoniacal\r\nsmells, organic exhalations, smoke, and dust, will be invited to shun\r\nthe interiors of railway cars, and comparative comfort will descend\r\nupon the peregrinating public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINERAL RESOURCES OF MISSOURI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe incalculable wealth, which lies hid in the bosom of Mother Earth,\r\nin our vast possessions of the West, is undoubtedly centered in the\r\nState of Missouri; and the development of this fund of riches must\r\nadd to the national prosperity, not only by its immeasurable intrinsic\r\nvalue, but by its affording occupation to armies of laborers, the\r\nlatter being the highest and most important consideration.\r\n\r\nIn 1852-3, a geological survey of the State was wisely decided upon,\r\nand a liberal provision for its execution made. Two valuable reports,\r\nby Professor Swallow, have been printed, in the year 1855, but the\r\nnotes of his subsequent investigations have not been made public.\r\n\r\nIn the session of 1869-70, further action, in this important public\r\nwork, was taken by the State legislature, and arrangements made for a\r\nstill more accurate and detailed examination, under the direction of\r\nProfessor A. D. Hager, of Vermont.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of metals all over the State will be seen in the\r\nfollowing figures, taken from the St. Louis _Journal of Commerce_,\r\nwhich show the number of counties in which the various ores are found:\r\nIron in 46 counties, lead in 43, coal in 36, copper in 24, marble in\r\n11, zinc in 27, fire clay in 16, barytes in 10, nickel in 6, granite\r\nin 4, tin in 4, plumbago in 2, gypsum in 2, alum in 1, antimony in 4.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no country in the world so endowed as this. Of iron\r\nalone, according to the State geologist's report for 1855, there is\r\nore of the best quality, sufficient to furnish 200,000,000 tuns of\r\niron; and this quantity lies in a small space, in the vicinity of\r\nPilot Knob and Iron Mountain, and within 100 miles of St. Louis.\r\n\r\nThe quality of the iron is highly spoken of by the manufacturers, and\r\nthe capacity of the smelting appliances has reached to over 150,000\r\ntuns per annum. The coal is well suited for reduction of ores,\r\neither by hot or cold blast treatment. The Scotia Iron Co. commenced\r\noperations in January, 1870; and, although the materials for building\r\nblast furnaces had to be carried 80 miles into a desert, the first\r\nfurnace was blown into blast in August, 1870. This furnace will run\r\nabout 24 tuns per day. The company procures ore from a hill, near the\r\nfurnace, in which there is an apparently inexhaustible supply of red\r\noxide and brown specular. This ore yields 60 per cent of pure metal.\r\nThe erection of mills for making wrought iron is contemplated, and the\r\nhigh quality and prodigious quantity of the raw material will justify\r\nand reward any outlay of capital in this direction.\r\n\r\nThe shipment of ore to other States goes on constantly, the last\r\nyear's account showing that 246,555 tuns were dispersed over Indiana,\r\nOhio, and others. The furnaces at Kingsland, South St. Louis, Lewis\r\nIron Co.'s Works, Carondelet, and Maramec are all well situated as\r\nto coal and limestone, the Maramec Works having a most valuable\r\nwater-power. These latter works also ship about 40,000 tuns red\r\nhematite ore yearly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to _Petermann's Mittheilungen_, the new German empire,\r\nincluding Alsatia and Lorraine, will embrace 9,901 square miles, with\r\n40,148,209 inhabitants. Russia alone will exceed it in extent and\r\npopulation, for Russia in Europe has 100,285 square miles with a\r\npopulation of 69,379,500. France, after the loss of Alsatia and\r\nLorraine, will have 9,588 square miles of territory, with 36,428,548\r\ninhabitants.

W. W.\r\nGriffin, clerk in charge of the draftsmen's division, who, it appears,\r\nhas been levying black mail on the lady employes of the office, for\r\nnearly two years. During the administration of Colonel Fisher, late\r\nCommissioner of Patents, a large number of ladies were employed, for\r\nthe purpose of recopying drawings, when ordered by the inventors, of\r\npatents already on file.\r\n\r\n\"These ladies were placed under charge of Griffin, with power to\r\nretain them in office so long as their services were satisfactory. It\r\nhas been proved that Griffin hired the ladies at regular salaries of\r\n$1,000 per annum, the most of whom he blackmailed to the amount of\r\n$400 per year each. It is estimated that he has made $1,000 per month\r\nfor the past two years.\r\n\r\n\"The matter was brought to the notice of Commissioner Duncan, and an\r\ninvestigation ordered, which resulted in the dismissal of Griffin.\r\n\r\n\"It is thought that there are other cases of this kind, and the\r\nCommissioner expresses his determination to ferret them all out,\r\nand make a clean sweep of all parties in his department engaged in\r\nswindling operations, against the government or against individuals.\r\n\r\n\"The Patent Office has for a long time been considered a rich field\r\nfor operations of this kind, and investigations have often been\r\nsuggested, but passed unheeded by the proper authorities.\r\n\r\n\"It is openly stated that an investigation into the relations existing\r\nbetween certain examiners of patents and certain patent agents, would\r\ndisclose a more fearful state of blackmailing than exists in all the\r\nother government departments combined.\"\r\n\r\n[We find the above sensational paragraph among the recent Washington\r\nitems of the _Evening Mail_. We are in a position to say that \"the\r\nhigh state of excitement\" alluded to has existed only in the brain of\r\nthe newspaper correspondent. The facts, in brief, are these: In July,\r\n1869, a lady, and wife of one of the clerks in the draftsmen's room,\r\nmade application to Commissioner Fisher for a position in the copying\r\ndivision of the same department; and, upon the urgent solicitation and\r\nrecommendation of Mr. E. W. W. Griffin, chief of the division, she\r\nwas appointed, and has held the position from that time until now,\r\nreceiving as salary $1,000 per annum, which, with the full knowledge\r\nof her husband, she has divided with Griffin, in consideration of his\r\nservices in procuring for her the appointment. About a month ago, one\r\nof the lady's friends got hold of the matter, and reported it to the\r\nCourt, which resulted in an investigation and the subsequent dismissal\r\nof Griffin. This is the only case of the kind that we have heard of,\r\nand we have no reason to believe that there is any other, or that\r\ncorruption exists in the Examining Corps, as alleged.--EDS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA method of testing the purity of samples of water, by watching\r\nthe rapidity of its action on soap and similar compounds, has been\r\nintroduced by the French _savants_, MM.

Fesquet, Chemist and Engineer.\r\nTo which is added an Appendix, containing Information respecting the\r\nMaterials and the Practice of Coach and Car Painting and Varnishing,\r\nin the United States and Great Britain. Philadelphia: Henry Carey\r\nBaird, Industrial Publisher, 406 Walnut street. London: Sampson Low,\r\nSon & Marston, Crown Buildings, 188 Fleet street. 1871. Price, by\r\nmail, to any part of the United States, $1.25.\r\n\r\n  This is another of the large number of practical works and\r\n  industrial treatises issued from the press of Mr. Baird. It is\r\n  intended as a practical manual for the use of coach painters, and\r\n  we must say, upon examination of its contents, that we think it\r\n  admirably adapted to meet the wants of that class of artisans\r\n  for which it has been prepared. There is perhaps no department of\r\n  decorative art in which there is greater room for the display of\r\n  skill and taste than in coach painting. This work, however, does\r\n  not deal with the subject of art, to any great extent. Its aim\r\n  is to give information in regard to colors, varnishes, etc., and\r\n  their management in carriage painting in the plainest manner, and\r\n  in this way it thoroughly fulfils the intention of the author.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE GENERATION OF SPECIES. By St. George Mivart, F. R. S. London:\r\nMACMILLAN & CO. 1871.\r\n\r\n  The Darwinian theory of the Origin of Species, has, perhaps,\r\n  aroused more attention, excited more dispute, and won more\r\n  converts in a shorter time among scientific and unscientific\r\n  men, than any other of equal importance promulgated in the 19th\r\n  century. It seems to be the rule either to swallow the theory\r\n  whole, or reject it as unworthy of belief, and as conflicting with\r\n  orthodoxy. The author of the work before us has, however, taken\r\n  a middle ground, from which we opine it will be difficult to\r\n  dislodge him, though it is within full range of the batteries of\r\n  both the contending parties. While he admits the truth of Darwin's\r\n  views regarding the operation of natural selection as a cause of\r\n  the origin of species, he denies that it is the sole cause, yet\r\n  maintains that if it could be demonstrated to be the sole cause,\r\n  it would in no manner conflict with orthodox belief in the\r\n  Scriptures as the revelation of God to mankind. The perfect candor\r\n  of the author is one of the marked features of the discussion,\r\n  and his style is a model of pure terse English writing, seldom,\r\n  if ever, excelled by any scientific writer. The work is an octavo,\r\n  most beautifully printed on tinted paper, and illustrated by many\r\n  fine wood engravings.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHITECT'S AND BUILDER'S POCKET COMPANION AND PRICE BOOK,\r\nConsisting of a Short but Comprehensive Epitome of Decimals,\r\nDuodecimals, Geometry and Mensuration; with Tables of U.

Consequently, unless the\r\nmelter exercises good judgment in charging, the Scotch pig will\r\nmelt and run off before the car-wheel iron is melted. If G. H. P.\r\nbe particular in the quality and strength of his iron, he will make\r\nbetter results by using soft American charcoal pig, with old car-wheel\r\niron. It will make stronger castings, mix better, and melt more\r\nuniformly; but he should always recollect in charging his furnace that\r\nsoft iron will melt before hard in the same position, in the cupola. I\r\nalso think he had better use a larger proportion of soft pig, as every\r\ntime cast iron is melted it becomes harder, so much so that iron which\r\ncan be filed and turned with ease, when re-cast will often be found\r\ntoo hard to work.--J.

H. will use one pound of alum for every\r\nfive pounds of tallow, his candles will be as hard and white as wax.\r\nThe alum must be dissolved in water, then put in the tallow, and\r\nstirred until they are both melted together, and run in molds.--F. O.\r\nH.\r\n\r\n\r\nL. L., of N. Y.--According to Ure, strass is made as follows: 8 ounces\r\nof pure rock crystal or flint, in powder, mixed with 4 ounces of\r\nsalt of tartar, are to be baked and left to cool. The mixture is then\r\npoured into hot water, and treated with dilute nitric acid till it\r\nceases to effervesce, and the \"frit\" is then washed in water till the\r\nwater comes off tasteless. The frit is then dried, and mixed with 12\r\nounces of white lead, and this last mixture reduced to fine powder,\r\nand washed with distilled water; 1 ounce of calcined borax is now\r\nadded to every 12 ounces of the mixture, the whole rubbed together in\r\na porcelain mortar, melted in a clean crucible, and poured out into\r\npure cold water. This melting and pouring into water must be done\r\nthree times, using a clean, new crucible each time. The third frit is\r\npulverized, five drachms of niter added, and then melted for the last\r\ntime, when a clean, beautiful white crystal mass results.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. M. S., of Wis.--There are no precise proportions observed in\r\nmaking the coal-tar and gravel walks of which you speak. The aim is to\r\nsaturate the gravel with the hot tar without surplus. The interstices\r\nof the gravel are simply to be filled, and the amount required to\r\ndo this depends wholly upon the coarseness or fineness of the gravel\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n\r\nW. P. T., of Ohio.--Two teams of horses, of equal strength, pulling\r\nagainst each other, by means of a rope, would create the same tension\r\nin the rope, as one of the teams drawing against an immovable object.\r\n\r\n\r\nW. H. B., of Va.--Ice can be made by compressing air, and, after it\r\nhas radiated its heat, allowing it to extract the heat of water with\r\nwhich it is brought into contact. The temperature of air at 59 deg. Fah.,\r\nwould be raised, by compressing the air to one fourth its original\r\nvolume, to 317 deg. Fah; and the air would radiate and absorb again, in\r\nexpanding, about 190 units of heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nE. T. H., of Ga.--The friable sandstone, a specimen of which you send\r\nus, may, we think, be rendered firmer by soaking it in a solution of\r\nsilicate of soda, and allowing it to stand till dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. A. V., of Ohio.--The use of steam expansively, by means of cut-off\r\nappliances, enables the expansive force of the steam to be utilized,\r\nwhich cannot be done when the pressure is maintained at one standard,\r\nand steam admitted through the fall stroke. It takes no more power\r\nto do a given amount of work in one case than in the other, but more\r\nboiler capacity, and more fuel, as the working power of the steam is\r\nmore economically applied when the cut-off is used.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeo. F. R., of Ohio.--Type metal is composed of 3 parts lead and 1\r\npart antimony for smallest, hardest, and most brittle types; 4 of\r\nlead and 1 of antimony for next grade; 5 of lead and 1 of antimony for\r\nmedium sizes; 6 of lead and 1 of antimony for larger types; and 7 of\r\nlead and 1 of antimony for the largest.\r\n\r\n\r\nE. J. M., of Texas.--The term \"power of a boiler\" means its\r\nevaporating power, and in that sense is proper. If its evaporative\r\npower be sufficient to perform a given amount of work, it is proper\r\nto estimate that work in horse power. Water can not be pumped out of a\r\npipe from which atmospheric air is excluded. A pipe driven into a soil\r\nimpervious to air, can never yield water unless the water is forced up\r\nby hydraulic power, as in the artesian system.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. P. Y., of N. Y.--You will find descriptions of iron enamelling\r\nprocesses, on pages 297 and 408, Vol. XII. of this journal. It can be\r\ndone in colors. See Ure's \"Dictionary of Arts and Manufactures.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nH. C., of Pa.--We do not think increasing the size of the journals of\r\nyour car axles from 21/2 inches to 6 inches diameter, would make them\r\nrun lighter.\r\n\r\n\r\nH. H. A., of N. Y.--The lining up of a beam engine, in a vessel, is\r\na process for which no definite mode of procedure is exclusively\r\napplicable. It is an operation to which common sense and judgment must\r\nbe brought, and for which each engineer must be a law unto himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. S., of Va.--The use of horizontal propellers to force balloons up\r\nor down is not a new suggestion. It has been tried, but, we believe,\r\nwithout much practical success.\r\n\r\nJ. T .S., of N. Y.--You will find further information on the subject\r\nof transmitting power by compressed air, in our editorial columns of\r\nlast week.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPLICATIONS FOR EXTENSION OF PATENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARVESTERS.--William T.

During this\r\nlong experience they have examined not less than _Fifty Thousand\r\nInventions_, and have prosecuted upwards of THIRTY THOUSAND\r\nAPPLICATIONS FOR PATENTS. In addition to this they have made, at the\r\nPatent Office, _Twenty-Five Thousand_ Special Examinations into the\r\nnovelty of various Inventions.\r\n\r\nThe important advantage of MUNN & CO.'s American and European Patent\r\nAgency is that the practice has been tenfold greater than that of any\r\nother agency in existence, with the additional advantages of having\r\nthe aid of the highest professional skill in every department and a\r\nBranch Office at Washington, that watches and supervises cases when\r\nnecessary, as they pass through Official Examination.\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO.,\r\n\r\nASK SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEIR SYSTEM OF DOING BUSINESS.\r\n\r\n_CONSULTATION AND OPINIONS FREE._\r\n\r\nInventors who desire to consult with MUNN & CO. are invited to call at\r\ntheir office 37 PARK ROW, or to send a sketch and description of the\r\ninvention, which will be examined and an opinion given or sent by mail\r\nwithout charge.\r\n\r\nA SPECIAL EXAMINATION\r\n\r\nis made into the novelty of an invention by personal examination at\r\nthe Patent Office of all patented inventions bearing on the particular\r\nclass. This search is made by examiners of long experience, for which\r\na fee of $5 is charged. A report is given in writing.\r\n\r\nTo avoid all possible misapprehension, MUNN & CO. advise generally,\r\nthat inventors send models. But the Commissioner may at his discretion\r\ndispense with a model--this can be arranged beforehand.\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO. take special care in preparation of drawings and\r\nspecifications.\r\n\r\nIf a case should for any cause be rejected it is investigated\r\nimmediately, and the rejection if an improper one set aside.\r\n\r\nNO EXTRA CHARGE\r\n\r\nis made to clients for this extra service. MUNN & CO. have skillful\r\nexperts in attendance to supervise cases and to press them forward\r\nwhen necessary.\r\n\r\nREJECTED CASES.\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO. give very special attention to the examination and\r\nprosecution of rejected cases filed by inventors and other attorneys.\r\nIn such cases a fee of $5 is required for special examination and\r\nreport; and in case of probable success by further prosecution and the\r\npapers are found tolerably well prepared, MUNN & CO. will take up the\r\ncase and endeavor to get it through for a reasonable fee to be agreed\r\nupon in advance of prosecution.\r\n\r\nCAVEATS\r\n\r\nAre desirable if an inventor is not fully prepared to apply for a\r\nPatent. A Caveat affords protection for one year against the issue of\r\na patent to another for the same invention. Caveat papers should be\r\ncarefully prepared.\r\n\r\nThe Government fee on filing a Caveat is $10, and MUNN & CO.'s charge\r\nfor preparing the necessary papers is usually from $10 to $12.\r\n\r\nREISSUES.\r\n\r\nA patent when discovered to be defective may be reissued by the\r\nsurrender of the original patent, and the filing of amended papers.\r\nThis proceeding should be taken with great care.\r\n\r\nDESIGNS, TRADE-MARKS, & COMPOSITIONS\r\n\r\nCan be patented for a term of years, also new medicines or medical\r\ncompounds, and useful mixtures of all kinds.\r\n\r\nWhen the invention consists of a medicine or compound, or a new\r\narticle of manufacture, or a new composition, samples of the article\r\nmust be furnished, neatly put up. There should also be forwarded a\r\nfull statement of its ingredients, proportions, mode of preparation,\r\nuses, and merits.\r\n\r\nCANADIANS and all other foreigners can now obtain patents upon the\r\nsame terms as citizens.\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN PATENTS.\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO. have solicited a larger number of European Patents than\r\nany other agency. They have agents located at London, Paris, Brussels,\r\nBerlin, and other chief cities. A pamphlet containing a synopsis of\r\nthe Foreign Patent Laws sent free.\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO. could refer, if necessary, to thousands of patentees who\r\nhave had the benefit of their advice and assistance, to many of the\r\nprincipal business men in this and other cities, and to members of\r\nCongress and prominent citizens throughout the country.\r\n\r\nAll communications are treated as confidential.\r\n\r\n_Address_\r\n\r\nMUNN & CO.,\r\nNo. 37 Park Row,\r\n_NEW  YORK._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECENT AMERICAN AND FOREIGN PATENTS.\r\n\r\n_Under this heading we shall publish weekly notes of some of the more\r\nprominent home and foreign patents._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSELF-ACTING SHACKLE AND CAR BRAKE.--Lyman Alphonzo Russell,\r\nShrewsbury, Vt.--This invention relates to improvements in self-acting\r\nshackles and car brakes, and consists in an improved connection of\r\nthe brakes with the shackle, for automatic operation, whereby the\r\nconnection may be readily so adjusted that the brakes will not be set\r\nin action as when required to back up the train.\r\n\r\nFEED BAGS FOR HORSES.--W. A. Hough, South Butler, N. Y.--This\r\ninvention relates to a new and useful improvement in feed bags for\r\nhorses, and consists in making the bag self-supplying, by means of\r\none or more reservoirs, the discharge orifices of which reservoirs are\r\nclosed by a valve or valves.\r\n\r\nTRUSS.--Adam Hinoult, Montgomery, N. Y.--This invention has for its\r\nobject to furnish an improved truss, which shall be so constructed as\r\nto yield freely to the various movements of the body of the wearer,\r\nwhile holding the rupture securely in place.\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR FOR STEAM ENGINES.--Charles A. Conde, Indianapolis,\r\nInd.--This invention relates to a new method of regulating the\r\nmovement of the balls of a steam governor, with a view of adjusting\r\nthe same in proportion to the increased or diminished centrifugal\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR SAW GUARD.--G. W. Shipman, Ischua, N. Y.--This invention\r\nrelates to a new and useful improvement in means for protecting the\r\noperator and others, near running circular saws, from injury, and it\r\nconsists in a movable guard, operated by means of the saw carriage, in\r\nsuch a manner that, during the period of danger (when the saw is not\r\ncutting), the guard covers the saw, and is thrown back from the saw\r\nwhen the latter is in actual use.\r\n\r\nCARPET-CLEANING MACHINE.--J. C. Craft, Baltimore, Md.--This invention\r\nrelates to a machine, through which a carpet may be passed, and so\r\nbeaten and brushed, during its passage, as to come out of the\r\nmachine thoroughly cleansed. The invention consists in the peculiar\r\nconstruction and arrangement of beaters and brushes for effecting this\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nCOMBINED COTTON AND CORN PLANTER.--L. A. Perrault, Natchez,\r\nMiss.--This invention relates to improvements in machinery for\r\nplanting seed, and consists in a combination, in one machine, of a\r\nseed-dropping apparatus, adapted for corn, and another adapted for\r\ncotton, in a manner to utilize one running gear for the two kinds of\r\nseed, and thereby save the expense of separate gear for each.\r\n\r\nLIME KILN.--T. A. Kirk, Kansas City, Mo.--This invention has for its\r\nobject to furnish an improved lime kiln, which shall be so constructed\r\nas to enable the kiln to be worked from the front, in firing and in\r\ndrawing the lime and ashes, which will not allow cold or unburnt rock\r\nto pass through, and which will consume its own smoke.\r\n\r\nCAR BRAKE.--S. D. Tripp, Lynn, and Luther Hill, Stoneham, Mass.--This\r\ninvention relates to improvements in railroad car brakes, and consists\r\nin an arrangement, on the locomotive or tender, of a steam cylinder\r\nand piston, and the arrangement, on the cars, in connection with the\r\nbrakes, of sliding rods, so that the rod of the car next to the\r\nengine or tender, being moved backwards by the piston rod of the above\r\ncylinder, will bring the brakes of the rear wheels down upon them, as\r\nwell as the brakes of the tender, and slacken the speed thereby, so\r\nthat the rear projecting end of the brake rod will come in contact\r\nwith the rod of the next car, and set its brakes in action in like\r\nmanner, and so on, throughout the train. The arrangement of the said\r\nbrake actuating rods is such that no matter which end of the car is\r\nforemost, the wheels of one track will be acted on by the brakes.\r\n\r\nCOMBINED RULER, BLOTTER, AND PAPER CUTTER.--Hugh S. Ball,\r\nSpartanburgh, S. C.--This invention relates to a new and useful\r\nimprovement in a combined ruler, blotter, and paper cutter, three\r\narticles indispensable for the desk, combined in one.\r\n\r\nREED FOR ORGANS AND MELODEONS.--Augustus Newell, Chicago, Ill.--The\r\nobject of this invention is to so construct the tongue-butts, or\r\nshanks, of musical reeds, that the same cannot, during the vibratory\r\nmotion of the tongues, be raised from their seats.\r\n\r\nANTI-FRICTION COMPOUND.--Victory Purdy, Poughkeepsie, N.

W.\r\n\r\n2.--BOILER FURNACE.--I have two boilers, twenty-four feet long and\r\nfour feet in diameter each, with five ten-inch flues. The fire passes\r\nunder the boiler, and enters the flues at the back end, passes through\r\nthe flues, and enters the smoke stack at the front end. I use hard\r\npine wood for fuel. Will some of your many readers give me the best\r\nway of constructing the flue under the boiler, from the end of the\r\ngrate bars to where it enters the flues at the back end, and also\r\nstate the proper distance from the back wall to the end of the\r\nboiler?--N. H.\r\n\r\n3.--MEDAL CASTS.--I have some medals which I should like to copy.\r\nHaving tried several times, and failed, I thought that I would ask\r\nadvice through your query columns. I do not know of what the medals\r\nare manufactured. They are, I suppose, made to imitate bronze. I have\r\ntried casting them in plaster of Paris molds, but have had very poor\r\nsuccess, as the surface of the medals was covered with small holes.\r\nThe metal used was lead and antimony, seven to one. I should like to\r\nknow, if there be any metal that I can cast them of, and bring out the\r\nbronze color afterwards, or if there be any metal that I can cast them\r\nof, and afterwards color by some solution. Also, of what should I make\r\nmy molds?--J. E. M.\r\n\r\n4.--REMOVING THE TASTE OF TAR FROM RAIN WATER.--Will some of your\r\ncorrespondents tell me if rain water, which runs off a gravel roof,\r\nand tastes very strongly of tar, is unhealthy, and if there be\r\nanything that will prevent its tasting, as it is very disagreeable for\r\ncooking purposes?--C.

It is easy of application, and does\r\nnot require any repairs for a long time. It is more durable than\r\nsome slates, and has been found a suitable substitute for iron or\r\ntin roofs. It has a sanded or stony surface, which renders it\r\nUNINFLAMMABLE and FIRE-PROOF. Exposed to the most intense fire, and\r\nsparks falling upon it, it will not propagate the fire. Under the\r\ninfluence of the sun it will not run, which makes it specially adapted\r\nto hot climates. Its easy application and pleasing appearance have\r\nmade it a favorite roofing material throughout all the Indies and\r\nother colonies. Being not cumbrous for transport, it is of invaluable\r\nservice to settlers and farmers in far remote districts. When used for\r\ntemporary purposes it may be taken off and applied again to another\r\nconstruction. It replaces common Asphalting on Terraces, Lobbies,\r\nCounting-houses, Office Floors, etc.; is a great preservative against\r\ndampness and vermin, and equalizes the temperature. It is 32 inches\r\nwide, and made in rolls of 25 yards each. Send for circular to\r\n\r\nE. H. MARTIN,\r\n70 MAIDEN LANE AND 9 LIBERTY ST., N.

The ingredients are strictly free from deleterious\r\nsubstances, and hence the full strength of each is obtained, and the\r\nresults are uniform every time it is used. This cannot be the case in\r\nthose of ordinary manufacture, and for proof of our assertion, we ask\r\nthose who have never used DOOLEY'S YEAST POWDER to give it a trial.\r\nYour grocer keeps it.
