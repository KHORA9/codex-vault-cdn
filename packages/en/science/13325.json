EMERSON TENNENT, K.C.S. LL.D. &c.\r\n\r\n1861\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the contents of the present volume formed the\r\nzoological section of a much more comprehensive work recently published,\r\non the history and present condition of Ceylon.[1] But its inclusion\r\nthere was a matter of difficulty; for to have altogether omitted the\r\nchapters on Natural History would have impaired the completeness of the\r\nplan on which I had attempted to describe the island; whilst to insert\r\nthem as they here appear, without curtailment, would have encroached\r\nunduly on the space required for other essential topics. In this\r\ndilemma, I was obliged to adopt the alternative of so condensing the\r\nmatter as to bring the whole within the prescribed proportions.\r\n\r\nBut this operation necessarily diminished the general interest of the\r\nsubjects treated, as well by the omission of incidents which would\r\notherwise have been retained, as by the exclusion of anecdotes\r\ncalculated to illustrate the habits and instincts of the animals\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ceylon: An Account of the Island, Physical, Historical,\r\nand Typographical; with Notices of its Natural History, Antiquities, and\r\nProductions._ By Sir JAMES EMERSON TENNENT, K.C.S., LL.D., &c.\r\nIllustrated by Maps. Plans, and Drawings. 2 vols. 8vo. Longman and Co.,\r\n1859.]\r\n\r\nA suggestion to re-publish these sections in an independent form has\r\nafforded an opportunity for repairing some of these defects by revising\r\nthe entire, restoring omitted passages, and introducing fresh materials\r\ncollected in Ceylon; the additional matter occupying a very large\r\nportion of the present volume.\r\n\r\nI have been enabled, at the same time, to avail myself of the\r\ncorrections and communications of scientific friends; and thus to\r\ncompensate, in some degree for what is still incomplete, by increased\r\naccuracy in minute particulars.\r\n\r\nIn the Introduction to the First Edition of the original work I alluded,\r\nin the following terms, to that portion of it which is now reproduced in\r\nan extended form:--\r\n\r\n\"Regarding the _fauna_ of Ceylon, little has been published in any\r\ncollective form, with the exception of a volume by Dr. KELAART entitled\r\n_Prodromus Faunæ Zeilanicæ_; several valuable papers by Mr. EDGAR L.\r\nLAYARD in the _Annals and Magazine of Natural History_ for 1852 and\r\n1853; and some very imperfect lists appended to PRIDHAM'S compiled\r\naccount of the island.[1] KNOX, in the charming narrative of his\r\ncaptivity, published in the feign of Charles II., has devoted a chapter\r\nto the animals of Ceylon, and Dr. DAVY has described some of the\r\nreptiles: but with these exceptions the subject is almost untouched in\r\nworks relating to the colony. Yet a more than ordinary interest attaches\r\nto the inquiry, since Ceylon, instead of presenting, as is generally\r\nassumed, an identity between its _fauna_ and that of Southern India,\r\nexhibits a remarkable diversity, taken in connection with the limited\r\narea over which the animals included in it are distributed. The island,\r\nin fact, may be regarded as the centre of a geographical circle,\r\npossessing within itself forms, whose allied species radiate far into\r\nthe temperate regions of the north, as well as in to Africa, Australia,\r\nand the isles of the Eastern Archipelago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _An Historical, Political, and Statistical Account of\r\nCeylon and its Dependencies_, by C. PRIDHAM, Esq. 2 vols. 8vo., London,\r\n1849.]\r\n\r\n\"In the chapters that I have devoted to its elucidation, I have\r\nendeavoured to interest others in the subject, by describing my own\r\nobservations and impressions, with fidelity, and with as much accuracy\r\nas may be expected from a person possessing, as I do, no greater\r\nknowledge of zoology and the other physical sciences than is ordinarily\r\npossessed by any educated gentleman. It was my good fortune, however, in\r\nmy journeys to have the companionship of friends familiar with many\r\nbranches of natural science: the late Dr. GARDNER, Mr. EDGAR L. LAYARD,\r\nan accomplished zoologist, Dr. TEMPLETON, and others; and I was thus\r\nenabled to collect on the spot many interesting facts relative to the\r\nstructure and habits of the numerous tribes. These, chastened by the\r\ncorrections of my fellow-travellers, and established by the examination\r\nof collections made in the colony, and by subsequent comparison with\r\nspecimens contained in museums at home, I have ventured to submit as\r\nfaithful outlines of the _fauna_ of Ceylon.\r\n\r\n\"The sections descriptive of the several classes are accompanied by\r\nlists, prepared with the assistance of scientific friends, showing the\r\nextent to which each particular branch had been investigated by\r\nnaturalists, up to the period of my departure from Ceylon at the close\r\nof 1849. These, besides their inherent interest, will, I trust,\r\nstimulate others to engage in the same pursuit, by exhibiting chasms,\r\nwhich it remains for future industry and research to fill up;--and the\r\nstudy of the zoology of Ceylon may thus serve as a preparative for that\r\nof Continental India, embracing, as the former does, much that is common\r\nto both, as well as possessing a _fauna_ peculiar to the island, that in\r\nitself will amply repay more extended scrutiny.\r\n\r\n\"From these lists have been excluded all species regarding the\r\nauthenticity of which reasonable doubts could be entertained[1], and of\r\nsome of them, a very few have been printed in _italics_, in order to\r\ndenote the desirability of more minute comparison with well-determined\r\nspecimens in the great national depositories before finally\r\nincorporating them with the Singhalese catalogues.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: An exception occurs in the list of shells, prepared by Mr.\r\nSYLVANUS HANLEY, in which some whose localities are doubtful have been\r\nadmitted for reasons adduced. (See p. 387.)]\r\n\r\n\"In the labour of collecting and verifying the facts embodied in these\r\nsections, I cannot too warmly express my thanks for the aid I have\r\nreceived from gentlemen interested in similar studies in Ceylon: from\r\nDr. KELAART[1] and Mr. EDGAR L. LAYARD, as well as from officers of the\r\nCeylon Civil Service; the Hon. GERALD C. TALBOT, Mr. C.R. BULLER, Mr.\r\nMERCER, Mr. MORRIS, Mr. WHITING, Major SKINNER, and Mr. MITFORD.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is with deep regret that I have to record the death of\r\nthis accomplished gentleman, which occurred in 1860.]\r\n\r\n\"Before venturing to commit these chapters of my work to the press, I\r\nhave had the advantage of having portions of them read by Professor\r\nHUXLEY, Mr. MOORE, of the East India House Museum; Mr. R. PATTERSON,\r\nF.R.S., author of the _Introduction to Zoology_; and by Mr. ADAM WHITE,\r\nof the British Museum; to each of whom I am exceedingly indebted for the\r\ncare they have bestowed. In an especial degree I have to acknowledge the\r\nkindness of Dr. J.E. GRAY, F.R.S., for valuable additions and\r\ncorrections in the list of the Ceylon Reptilia; and to Professor FARADAY\r\nfor some notes on the nature and qualities of the \"Serpent Stone,\"[2]\r\nsubmitted to him.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See p. 312.]\r\n\r\n\"The extent to which my observations on _the Elephant_ have been\r\ncarried, requires some explanation. The existing notices of this noble\r\ncreature are chiefly devoted to its habits and capabilities _in\r\ncaptivity_; and very few works, with which I am acquainted, contain\r\nillustrations of its instincts and functions when wild in its native\r\nwoods. Opportunities for observing the latter, and for collecting facts\r\nin connection with them, are abundant in Ceylon; and from the moment of\r\nmy arrival, I profited by every occasion afforded to me for observing\r\nthe elephant in a state of nature, and obtaining from hunters and\r\nnatives correct information as to its oeconomy and disposition.\r\nAnecdotes in connection with this subject, I received from some of the\r\nmost experienced residents in the island; amongst others, from Major\r\nSKINNER, Captain PHILIP PAYNE GALLWEY, Mr. FAIRHOLME, Mr. CRIPPS, and\r\nMr. MORRIS. Nor can I omit to express my acknowledgments to Professor\r\nOWEN, of the British Museum, to whom this portion of my manuscript was\r\nsubmitted previous to its committal to the press.\"\r\n\r\nTo the foregoing observations I have little to add beyond my\r\nacknowledgment to Dr. ALBERT GÜNTHER, of the British Museum, for the\r\ncommunication of important facts in illustration of the ichthyology of\r\nCeylon, as well as of the reptiles of the island.\r\n\r\nMr. BLYTH, of the Calcutta Museum, has carefully revised the Catalogue\r\nof Birds, and supplied me with much useful information in regard to\r\ntheir geographical distribution. To his experienced scrutiny is due the\r\nperfected state in which the list is now presented. It will be seen,\r\nhowever, from the italicised names still retained, that inquiry is far\r\nfrom being exhausted.\r\n\r\nMr. THWAITES, the able Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens at\r\nPeradenia, near Kandy, has forwarded to me many valuable observations,\r\nnot only in connection with the botany, but the zoology of the mountain\r\nregion. The latter I have here embodied in their appropriate places, and\r\nthose relating to plants and vegetation will appear in a future edition\r\nof my large work.\r\n\r\nTo M. NIETNER, of Colombo, I am likewise indebted for many particulars\r\nregarding Singhalese Entomology, a department to which his attention has\r\nbeen given, with equal earnestness and success.\r\n\r\nThrough the Hon. RICHARD MORGAN, acting Senior Puisne Judge of the\r\nSupreme Court at Colombo, I have received from his Interpreter, M.D. DE\r\nSILVA GOONERATNE MODLIAR, a Singhalese gentleman of learning and\r\nobservation, many important notes, of which I have largely availed\r\nmyself, in relation to the wild animals, and the folk-lore and\r\nsuperstitions of the natives in connection with them.\r\n\r\nOf the latter I have inserted numerous examples; in the conviction that,\r\nnotwithstanding their obvious errors in many instances, these popular\r\nlegends and traditions occasionally embody traces of actual observation,\r\nand may contain hints and materials deserving of minuter inquiry.\r\n\r\nI wish distinctly to disclaim offering the present volume as a\r\ncompendium of the Natural History of Ceylon. I present it merely as a\r\n\"mémoire pour servir,\" materials to assist some future inquirer in the\r\nformation of a more detailed and systematic account of the _fauna_ of\r\nthe island. My design has been to point out to others the extreme\r\nrichness and variety of the field, the facility of exploring it, and the\r\ncharms and attractions of the undertaking. I am eager to show how much\r\nremains to do by exhibiting the little that has as yet been done.\r\n\r\nThe departments of _Mammalia_ and _Birds_ are the only two which can be\r\nsaid to have as yet undergone tolerably close investigation; although\r\neven in these it is probable that large additions still remain to be\r\nmade to the ascertained species. But, independently of forms and\r\nspecific characteristics, the more interesting inquiry into habits and\r\ninstincts is still open for observation and remark; and for the\r\ninvestigation of these no country can possibly afford more inviting\r\nopportunities than Ceylon.\r\n\r\nConcerning the _Reptilia_ a considerable amount of information has been\r\namassed. The Batrachians and smaller Lizards have, I apprehend, been\r\nimperfectly investigated; but the Tortoises are well known, and the\r\nSerpents, from the fearful interest attaching to the race, and\r\nstimulating their destruction, have been so vigilantly pursued, that\r\nthere is reason to believe that few, if any, varieties exist which have\r\nnot been carefully examined. In a very large collection, made by Mr.\r\nCHARLES REGINALD BULLER during many years' residence in Kandy, and\r\nrecently submitted by him to Dr. Günther, only one single specimen\r\nproved to be new or previously unknown to belong to the island.\r\n\r\nOf the _Ichthyology_ of Ceylon I am obliged to speak ill very different\r\nterms; for although the materials are abundant almost to profusion,\r\nlittle has yet been done to bring them under thoroughly scientific\r\nscrutiny. In the following pages I have alluded to the large collection\r\nof examples of Fishes sent home by officers of the Medical Staff, and\r\nwhich still remain unopened, in the Fort Pitt Museum at Chatham; but I\r\nam not without hope that these may shortly undergo comparison with the\r\ndrawings which exist of each, and that this branch of the island _fauna_\r\nmay at last attract the attention to which its richness so eminently\r\nentitles it.\r\n\r\nIn the department of Entomology much has already been achieved; but an\r\nextended area still invites future explorers; and one which the Notes of\r\nMr. Walker prefixed to the List of Insects in this volume, show to be of\r\nextraordinary interest, from the unexpected convergence in Ceylon of\r\ncharacteristics heretofore supposed to have been kept distinct by the\r\nbroad lines of geographical distribution.\r\n\r\nRelative to the inferior classes of _Invertebrata_ very little has as\r\nyet been ascertained. The Mollusca, especially the lacustrine and\r\nfluviatile, have been most imperfectly investigated; and of the\r\nland-shells, a large proportion have yet to be submitted to scientific\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of the _Arachnida_ and _Crustacea_. The jungle is\r\nfrequented by spiders, _phalangia_[1], and acarids, of which nothing is\r\nknown with certainty; and the sea-shore and sands have been equally\r\noverlooked, so far as concerns the infinite variety of lobsters,\r\ncrayfish, crabs, and all their minor congeners. The _polypi, echini,\r\nasterias_, and other _radiata_ of the coast, as well as the _acalephæ_\r\nof the deeper waters, have shared the same neglect: and literally\r\nnothing has been done to collect and classify the infusoriæ and minuter\r\nzoophytes, the labours of Dr. Kelaart amongst the Diatomaceæ being the\r\nsolitary exception.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Commonly called \"harvest-men.\"]\r\n\r\nNothing is so likely to act as a stimulant to future research as an\r\naccurate conception of what has already been achieved. With equal\r\nterseness and truth Dr. Johnson has observed that the traveller who\r\nwould bring back knowledge from any country must carry knowledge with\r\nhim at setting out: and I am not without hope that the demonstration I\r\nnow venture to offer, of the little that has already been done for\r\nzoology in Ceylon, may serve to inspire others with a desire to resume\r\nand complete the inquiry.\r\n\r\nJ.

attention to\r\nwhich its richness and variety most amply entitle it. The Singhalese\r\nthemselves, habitually indolent, and singularly unobservant of nature\r\nand her operations, are at the same time restrained from the study of\r\nnatural history by the tenet of their religion which forbids the\r\ntaking of life under any circumstances. From the nature of their\r\navocations, the majority of the European residents, engaged in\r\nplanting and commerce, are discouraged by want of leisure from\r\ncultivating the taste; and it is to be regretted that, with few\r\nexceptions, the civil servants of the government, whose position and\r\nduties would have afforded them influence and extended opportunities\r\nfor successful investigation, have never seen the importance of\r\nencouraging such studies.\r\n\r\nThe first effective impulse to the cultivation of natural science in\r\nCeylon, was communicated by Dr. Davy when connected with the medical\r\nstaff[1] of the army from 1816 to 1820, and his example stimulated\r\nsome of the assistant-surgeons of Her Majesty's forces to make collections\r\nin illustration of the productions of the colony. Of these the late\r\nDr. Kinnis was one of the most energetic and successful. He was\r\nseconded by Dr. Templeton of the Royal Artillery, who engaged\r\nassiduously in the investigation of various orders, and commenced an\r\ninterchange of specimens with Mr. Blyth[2], the distinguished\r\nnaturalist and curator of the Calcutta Museum. The birds and rarer\r\nvertebrata of the island were thus compared with their peninsular\r\ncongeners, and a tolerable knowledge of those belonging to the island,\r\nso far as regards the higher classes of animals, has been the result.\r\nThe example so set was perseveringly followed by Mr. E.L. Layard and\r\nthe late Dr. Kelaart, and infinite credit is due to Mr. Blyth for the\r\nzealous and untiring energy with which he has devoted his attention\r\nand leisure to the identification of the specimens forwarded from\r\nCeylon, and to their description in the Calcutta Journal. To him, and\r\nto the gentlemen I have named, we are mainly indebted for whatever\r\naccurate knowledge we now possess of the zoology of the colony.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. DAVY, brother to the illustrious Sir Humphry Davy,\r\npublished, in 1821, his _Account of the Interior of Ceylon and its\r\nInhabitants_, which contains the earliest notice of the Natural\r\nHistory of the island, and especially of its ophidian reptiles.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Journ. Asiat. Soc.

Co-operating with him, Mr. Layard has\r\nsupplied a fund of information especially in ornithology and conchology.\r\nThe zoophytes and Crustacea have I believe been partially investigated\r\nby Professor Harvey, who visited Ceylon in 1852, and more recently by\r\nProfessor Schmarda, of the University of Prague. From the united labours\r\nof these gentlemen and others interested in the same pursuits, we may\r\nhope at an early day to obtain such a knowledge of the zoology of Ceylon\r\nas will to some extent compensate for the long indifference of the\r\ngovernment officers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Prodromus Faunæ Zeylanicæ; being Contributions to the\r\nZoology of Ceylon_, by F.

QUADRUMANA. 1. _Monkeys_.--To a stranger in the tropics, among\r\nthe most attractive creatures in the forests are the troops of\r\n_monkeys_ that career in ceaseless chase among the loftiest\r\ntrees. In Ceylon there are five species, four of which belong to one\r\ngroup, the Wanderoos, and the other is the little graceful grimacing\r\n_rilawa_[1], which is the universal pet and favourite of both\r\nnatives and Europeans. The Tamil conjurors teach it to dance, and in\r\ntheir wanderings carry it from village to village, clad in a grotesque\r\ndress, to exhibit its lively performances. It does not object to smoke\r\ntobacco. The Wanderoo is too grave and melancholy to be trained to\r\nthese drolleries.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Macacus pileatus_, Shaw and Desmarest. The\r\n\"bonneted Macaque\" is common in the south and west; it is replaced on\r\nthe neighbouring coast of the Peninsula of India by the Toque, _M.\r\nradiatus_, which closely resembles it in size, habit, and form, and\r\nin the peculiar appearance occasioned by the hairs radiating from the\r\ncrown of the head. A spectacled monkey is _said_ to inhabit the\r\nlow country near to Bintenne; but I have never seen one brought\r\nthence. A paper by Dr. TEMPLETON, in the _Mag. Nat. Hist._ n. s.\r\nxiv. p. 361, contains some interesting facts relative to the Rilawa of\r\nCeylon.]\r\n\r\nKNOX, in his captivating account of the island, gives an accurate\r\ndescription of both; the Rilawas, with \"no beards, white faces, and long\r\nhair on the top of their heads, which parteth and hangeth down like a\r\nman's, and which do a deal of mischief to the corn, and are so impudent\r\nthat they will come into their gardens and eat such fruit as grows\r\nthere. And the Wanderoos, some as large as our English spaniel dogs, of\r\na darkish grey colour, and black faces with great white beards round\r\nfrom ear to ear, which makes them show just like old men. This sort does\r\nbut little mischief, keeping in the woods, eating only leaves and buds\r\nof trees, but when they are catched they will eat anything.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: KNOX, _Historical Relation of Ceylon, an Island in the\r\nEast Indies_.--P. i. ch. vi. p. 25. Fol. Lond. 1681. See an account\r\nof his captivity in SIR J. EMERSON TENNENT'S _Ceylon_, etc., Vol.\r\nII. p. 66 n.]\r\n\r\nKNOX, whose experience during his long captivity was confined almost\r\nexclusively to the hill country around Kandy, spoke in all probability\r\nof one large and comparatively powerful species, _Presbytes ursinus_,\r\nwhich inhabits the lofty forests, and which, as well as another of the\r\nsame group, _P. Thersites_, was, till recently, unknown to European\r\nnaturalists. The Singhalese word _Ouandura_ has a generic sense, and\r\nbeing in every respect the equivalent fur our own term of \"monkey\" it\r\nnecessarily comprehends the low country species, as well as those which\r\ninhabit other parts of the island. In point of fact, there are no less\r\nthan four animals in the island, each of which is entitled to the name\r\nof \"wanderoo.\"[1] Each separate species has appropriated to itself a\r\ndifferent district of the wooded country, and seldom encroaches on the\r\ndomain of its neighbours.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Down to a very late period, a large and somewhat\r\nrepulsive-looking monkey, common to the Malabar coast, the Silenus\r\nveter, _Linn._, was, from the circumstance of his possessing a\r\n\"great white beard,\" incorrectly assumed to be the \"wanderoo\" of\r\nCeylon, described by KNOX; and under that usurped name it has figured\r\nin every author from Buffon to the present time. Specimens of the true\r\nSinghalese species were, however, received in Europe; but in the\r\nabsence of information in this country as to their actual habitat,\r\nthey were described, first by Zimmerman, on the continent, under the\r\nname of, _Leucoprymnus cephalopterus_, and subsequently by Mr. E.\r\nBennett, under that of _Semnopithecus Nestor_ (_Proc. Zool.\r\nSoc._ pt. i. p. 67: 1833); the generic and specific characters\r\nbeing on this occasion most carefully pointed out by that eminent\r\nnaturalist. Eleven years later Dr. Templeton forwarded to the\r\nZoological Society a description, accompanied by drawings, of the\r\nwanderoo of the western maritime districts of Ceylon, and noticed the\r\nfact that the wanderoo of authors (_S. veter_) was not to be\r\nfound in the island except as an introduced species in the custody of\r\nthe Arab horse-dealers, who visit the port of Colombo at stated\r\nperiods. Mr. Waterhouse, at the meeting (_Proc. Zool. Soc._ p. 1:\r\n1844) at which this communication was read, recognised the identity of\r\nthe subject of Dr. Templeton's description with that already laid\r\nbefore them by Mr. Bennett; and from this period the species in\r\nquestion was believed to truly represent the wanderoo of Knox. The\r\nlater discovery, however, of the _P. ursinus_ by Dr. Kelaart, in\r\nthe mountains amongst which we are assured that Knox spent so many\r\nyears of captivity, reopens the question, but at the same time appears\r\nto me clearly to demonstrate that in this latter we have in reality\r\nthe animal to which his narrative refers.]\r\n\r\n1. Of the four species found in Ceylon, the most numerous in the\r\nisland, and the one best known in Europe, is the Wanderoo of the low\r\ncountry, the _P. cephalopterus_ of Zimmerman.[1] Although common\r\nin the southern and western provinces, it is never found at a higher\r\nelevation than 1300 feet. It is an active and intelligent creature,\r\nlittle larger than the common bonneted Macaque, and far from being so\r\nmischievous as others of the monkeys in the island. In captivity it is\r\nremarkable for the gravity of its demeanour and for an air of\r\nmelancholy in its expression and movements which are completely in\r\ncharacter with its snowy beard and venerable aspect. In disposition it\r\nis gentle and confiding, sensible in the highest degree of kindness,\r\nand eager for endearing attention, uttering a low plaintive cry when\r\nits sympathies are excited. It is particularly cleanly in its habits\r\nwhen domesticated, and spends much of its time in trimming its fur,\r\nand carefully divesting its hair of particles of dust.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Leucoprymnus Nestor, _Bennett_.]\r\n\r\nThose which I kept at my house near Colombo were chiefly fed upon\r\nplantains and bananas, but for nothing did they evince a greater\r\npartiality than the rose-coloured flowers of the red hibiscus (H.\r\n_rosa-sinensis_).\r\n\r\nThese they devoured with unequivocal gusto; they likewise relished the\r\nleaves of many other trees, and even the bark of a few of the more\r\nsucculent ones. A hint might possibly be taken from this circumstance\r\nfor improving the regimen of monkeys in menageries, by the occasional\r\nadmixture of a few fresh leaves and flowers with their solid and\r\nsubstantial dietary.\r\n\r\nA white monkey, taken between Ambepusse and Kornegalle, where they are\r\nsaid to be numerous, was brought to me to Colombo. Except in colour,\r\nit had all the characteristics of _Presbytes cephalopterus_. So\r\nstriking was its whiteness that it might have been conjectured to be\r\nan albino, but for the circumstance that its eyes and face were black.\r\nI have heard that white monkeys have been seen near the Ridi-galle\r\nWihara in Seven Korles and also at Tangalle; but I never saw another\r\nspecimen. The natives say they are not uncommon, and KNOX that they\r\nare \"milk-white both in body and face; but of this sort there is not\r\nsuch plenty.\"[1] The Rev. R. SPENCE HARDY mentions, in his learned\r\nwork on _Eastern Monachism_, that on the occasion of his visit to\r\nthe great temple of Dambool, he encountered a troop of white monkeys\r\non the rock in which it is situated--which were, doubtless, a variety\r\nof the Wanderoo.[2] PLINY was aware of the fact that white monkeys are\r\noccasionally found in India.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: KNOX, pt. i.e. vi. p. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Eastern Monachism_. c: xix; p. 204.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: PLINY, Nat. Hist. I. viii. c. xxxii.]\r\n\r\nWhen observed in their native wilds, a party of twenty or thirty of\r\nthese creatures is generally busily engaged in the search for berries\r\nand buds. They are seldom to be seen on the ground, except when\r\nthey may have descended to recover seeds or fruit which have fallen at\r\nthe foot of their favourite trees. When disturbed, their leaps are\r\nprodigious: but, generally speaking, their progress is made not so\r\nmuch by _leaping_ as by swinging from branch to branch, using\r\ntheir powerful arms alternately; and when baffled by distance,\r\nflinging themselves obliquely so as to catch the lower boughs of an\r\nopposite tree, the momentum acquired by their descent being sufficient\r\nto cause a rebound of the branch, that carries them upwards again,\r\ntill they can grasp a higher and more distant one, and thus continue\r\ntheir headlong flight. In these perilous achievements, wonder is\r\nexcited less by the surpassing agility of these little creatures,\r\nfrequently encumbered as they are by their young, which cling to them\r\nin their career, than by the quickness of their eye and the unerring\r\naccuracy with which they seem almost to calculate the angle at which a\r\ndescent will enable them to cover a given distance, and the recoil to\r\nattain a higher altitude.\r\n\r\n2. The low country Wanderoo is replaced in the hills by the larger\r\nspecies, _P. ursinus_, which inhabits the mountain zone. The natives,\r\nwho designate the latter the _Maha_ or Great Wanderoo, to distinguish it\r\nfrom the _Kaloo_, or black one, with which they are familiar, describe\r\nit as much wilder, and more powerful than its congener of the lowland\r\nforests. It is rarely seen by Europeans, this portion of the country\r\nhaving till very recently been but partially opened; and even now it is\r\ndifficult to observe its habits, as it seldom approaches the few roads\r\nwhich wind through these deep solitudes. At early morning, ere the day\r\nbegins to dawn, its loud and peculiar howl, which consists of a quick\r\nrepetition of the sounds _how how!_ maybe frequently heard in the\r\nmountain jungles, and forms one of the characteristic noises of these\r\nlofty situations. It was first captured by Dr. Kelaart in the woods near\r\nNuera-ellia, and from its peculiar appearance it has been named _P.\r\nursinus_ by Mr. Blyth.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Blyth quotes as authority for this trivial name a\r\npassage from MAJOR FORBES' _Eleven Years in Ceylon;_ and I can\r\nvouch for the graphic accuracy of the remark.--\"A species of very\r\nlarge monkey, that passed some distance before me, when resting on all\r\nfours, looked so like a Ceylon bear, that I nearly took him for one.\"]\r\n\r\n3. The _P. Thersites_, which is chiefly distinguished from the\r\nothers by wanting the head tuft, is so rare that it was for some time\r\ndoubtful whether the single specimen procured by Dr. Templeton from\r\nthe Nuera-kalawa, west of Trincomalie, and on which Mr. Blyth\r\nconferred this new name, was in reality native; but the occurrence of\r\na second, since identified by Dr. Kelaart, has established its\r\nexistence as a separate species. Like the common wanderoo, the one\r\nobtained by Dr. Templeton was partial to fresh vegetables, plantains,\r\nand fruit; but he ate freely boiled rice, beans, and gram. He was fond\r\nof being noticed and petted, stretching out his limbs in succession to\r\nbe scratched, drawing himself up so that his ribs might be reached by\r\nthe finger, closing his eyes during the operation, and evincing his\r\nsatisfaction by grimaces irresistibly ludicrous.\r\n\r\n4. The _P. Priamus_ inhabits the northern and eastern provinces, and the\r\nwooded hills which occur in these portions of the island. In appearance\r\nit differs both in size and in colour from the common wanderoo, being\r\nlarger and more inclined to grey; and in habits it is much less\r\nreserved. At Jaffna, and in other parts of the island where the\r\npopulation is comparatively numerous, these monkeys become so\r\nfamiliarised with the presence of man as to exhibit the utmost daring\r\nand indifference. A flock of them will take possession of a Palmyra\r\npalm; and so effectually can they crouch and conceal themselves among\r\nthe leaves that, on the slightest alarm, the whole party becomes\r\ninvisible in an instant. The presence of a dog, however, excites such an\r\nirrepressible curiosity that, in order to watch his movements, they\r\nnever fail to betray themselves. They may be frequently seen congregated\r\non the roof of a native hut: and, some years ago, the child of a\r\nEuropean clergyman stationed near Jaffna having been left on the ground\r\nby the nurse, was so teased and bitten by them as to cause its death.\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese have the impression that the remains of a monkey are\r\nnever to be found in the forest; a belief which they have embodied in\r\nthe proverb that \"he who has seen a white crow, the nest of a paddi\r\nbird, a straight coco-nut tree, or a dead monkey, is certain to live\r\nfor ever.\" This piece of folk-lore has evidently reached Ceylon from\r\nIndia, where it is believed that persons dwelling on the spot where a\r\nhanumân monkey, _Semnopithecus entellus_, has been killed, will\r\ndie, that even its bones are unlucky, and that no house erected where\r\nthey are hid under ground can prosper. Hence when a dwelling is to be\r\nbuilt, it is one of the employments of the Jyotish philosophers to\r\nascertain by their science that none such are concealed; and Buchanan\r\nobserves that \"it is, perhaps, owing to this fear of ill-luck that no\r\nnative will acknowledge his having seen a dead hanumân.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: BUCHANAN'S _Survey of Bhagulpoor_, p. 142. At\r\nGibraltar it is believed that the body of a _dead monkey_ has\r\nnever been found on the rock.]\r\n\r\nThe only other quadrumanous animal found in Ceylon is the little\r\nloris[1], which, from its sluggish movements, nocturnal habits, and\r\nconsequent inaction during the day, has acquired the name of the\r\n\"Ceylon Sloth.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Loris græilis, _Geof_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LORIS.]\r\n\r\nThere are two varieties in the island; one of the ordinary fulvous\r\nbrown, and another larger, whose fur is entirely black. A specimen of\r\nthe former was sent to me from Chilaw, on the western coast, and lived\r\nfor some time at Colombo, feeding on rice, fruit, and vegetables. It was\r\npartial to ants and, other insects, and was always eager for milk or the\r\nbone of a fowl. The naturally slow motion of its limbs enables the loris\r\nto approach its prey so stealthily that it seizes birds before they can\r\nbe alarmed by its presence. The natives assert that it has been known to\r\nstrangle the pea-fowl at night, to feast on the brain. During the day\r\nthe one which I kept was usually asleep in the strange position\r\nrepresented on the last page; its perch firmly grasped with both hands,\r\nits back curved into a ball of soft fur, and its head hidden deep\r\nbetween its legs. The singularly-large and intense eyes of the loris\r\nhave attracted the attention, of the Singhalese, who capture the\r\ncreature for the purpose of extracting them as charms and love-potions,\r\nand this they are said to effect by holding the little animal to the\r\nfire till its eyeballs burst. Its Tamil name is _thaxangu_, or\r\n\"thin-bodied;\" and hence a deformed child or an emaciated person has\r\nacquired in the Tamil districts the same epithet. The light-coloured\r\nvariety of the loris in Ceylon has a spot on its forehead, somewhat\r\nresembling the _namam_, or mark worn by the worshippers of Vishnu; and,\r\nfrom this peculiarity, it is distinguished as the _Nama-thavangu_.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is an interesting notice of the Loris of Ceylon by\r\nDr. TEMPLETON, in the _Mag. Nat. Hist._ 1844, ch. xiv. p. 362.]\r\n\r\nII. CHEIROPTERA. _Bats_.--The multitude of _bats_ is one of the features\r\nof the evening landscape; they abound in every cave and subterranean\r\npassage, in the tunnels on the highways, in the galleries of the\r\nfortifications, in the roofs of the bungalows, and the ruins of every\r\ntemple and building. At sunset they are seen issuing from their diurnal\r\nretreats to roam through the twilight in search of crepuscular insects,\r\nand as night approaches and the lights in the rooms attract the\r\nnight-flying lepidoptera, the bats sweep round the dinner-table and\r\ncarry off their tiny prey within the glitter of the lamps. Including the\r\nfrugivorous section about sixteen species have been identified in\r\nCeylon; and remarkable varieties of two of these are peculiar to the\r\nisland. The colours of some of them are as brilliant as the plumage of a\r\nbird, bright yellow, deep orange, and a rich ferruginous brown inclining\r\nto red.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1:\r\n  Rhinolophus affinis? _var_. rubidus, _Kelaart_.\r\n  Hipposideros murinus, _var_. fulvus, _Kelaart_.\r\n  Hipposideros speoris, _var_. aureus, _Kelaart_.\r\n  Kerivoula picta, _Pallas_.\r\n  Scotophilus Heathii, _Horsf_.]\r\n\r\nBut of all the bats, the most conspicuous from its size and numbers,\r\nand the most interesting from its habits, is the rousette of\r\nCeylon[1];--the \"flying fox,\" as it is called by Europeans, from the\r\nsimilarity to that animal in its head and ears, its bright eyes, and\r\nintelligent little face. In its aspect it has nothing of the\r\ndisagreeable and repulsive look so common amongst the ordinary\r\nvespertilionidæ; it likewise differs from them in the want of the\r\nnose-leaf, as well as of the tail. In the absence of the latter, its\r\nflight is directed by means of a membrane attached to the inner side\r\nof each of the hind legs, and kept distended at the lower extremity by\r\na projecting bone, just as a fore-and-aft sail is distended by a\r\n\"gaff.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pteropus Edwardsii, _Geoff_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLYING FOXES.]\r\n\r\nIn size the body measures from ten to twelve inches in length, but the\r\narms are prolonged, and especially the metacarpal bones and phalanges of\r\nthe four fingers over which the leathery wings are distended, till the\r\nalar expanse measures between four and five feet. Whilst the function of\r\nthese metamorphosed limbs in sustaining flight entitles them to the\r\ndesignation of \"wings,\" they are endowed with another faculty, the\r\nexistence of which essentially distinguishes them from the feathery\r\nwings of a bird, and vindicates the appropriateness of the term\r\n_Cheiro-ptera_[1], or \"winged hands,\" by which the bats are designated.\r\nOver the entire surface of the thin membrane of which they are formed,\r\nsentient nerves of the utmost delicacy are distributed, by means of\r\nwhich the animal is enabled during the darkness to direct its motions\r\nwith security, avoiding objects against contact with which at such times\r\nits eyes and other senses would be insufficient to protect it.[2]\r\nSpallanzani ascertained the perfection of this faculty by a series of\r\ncruel experiments, by which he demonstrated that bats, even after their\r\neyes had been destroyed, and their external organs, of smell and hearing\r\nobliterated, were still enabled to direct their flight with unhesitating\r\nconfidence, avoiding even threads suspended to intercept them. But after\r\nascertaining the fact, Spallanzani was slow to arrive at its origin; and\r\nascribed the surprising power to the existence of some sixth\r\nsupplementary sense, the enjoyment of which was withheld from other\r\nanimals. Cuvier, however, dissipated the obscurity by showing the seat\r\nof this extraordinary endowment to be in the wings, the superficies of\r\nwhich retains the exquisite sensitiveness to touch that is inherent in\r\nthe palms of the human hand and the extremities of the fingers, as well\r\nas in the feet of some of the mammalia.[3] The face and head of the\r\n_Pteropus_ are covered with brownish-grey hairs, the neck and chest are\r\ndark ferruginous grey, and the rest of the body brown, inclining to\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: [Greek: cheir] the \"hand,\" and [Greek: pteron] a \"wing.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See BELL _On the Hand_, ch. iii. p. 70;]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See article on _Cheiroptera_, in TODD'S\r\n_Cyclopiadia of Anatomy and Physiology_, vol. i. p. 599.]\r\n\r\nThese active and energetic creatures, though chiefly frugivorous, are\r\nto some extent insectivorous also, as attested by their teeth[1], as\r\nwell as by their habits. They feed, amongst other things, on the\r\nguava, the plantain, the rose-apple, and the fruit of the various\r\nfig-trees. Flying foxes are abundant in all the maritime districts,\r\nespecially at the season when the _pulum-imbul_[2], one of the\r\nsilk-cotton trees, is putting forth its flower-buds, of which they are\r\nsingularly fond. By day they suspend themselves from the highest\r\nbranches, hanging by the claws of the hind legs, with the head turned\r\nupwards, and pressing the chin against the breast. At sunset taking\r\nwing, they hover, with a murmuring sound occasioned by the beating of\r\ntheir broad membranous wings, around the fruit trees, on which they\r\nfeed till morning, when they resume their pensile attitude as before.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Those which I have examined have four minute incisors in\r\neach jaw, with two canines and a very minute pointed tooth behind each\r\ncanine. They have six molars in the upper jaw and ten in the lower,\r\nlongitudinally grooved, and with a cutting edge directed backwards.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Eriodendron Orientale, _Stead_.]\r\n\r\nA favourite resort of these bats is to the lofty india-rubber trees,\r\nwhich on one side overhang the Botanic Gardens of Paradenia in the\r\nvicinity of Kandy. Thither for some years past, they have congregated,\r\nchiefly in the autumn, taking their departure when the figs of the\r\n_ficus elastica_ are consumed. Here they hang in such prodigious\r\nnumbers, that frequently, large branches give way beneath their\r\naccumulated weight. Every forenoon, generally between the hours of 9 and\r\n11 A.M., they take to wing, apparently for exercise, and possibly to sun\r\ntheir wings and fur, and dry them after the dews of the early morning.\r\nOn these occasions, their numbers are quite surprising, flying in clouds\r\nas thick as bees or midges. After these recreations, they hurry back to\r\ntheir favourite trees, chattering and screaming like monkeys, and always\r\nwrangling and contending angrily for the most shady and comfortable\r\nplaces in which to hang for the rest of the day protected from the sun.\r\nThe branches they resort to soon become almost divested of leaves, these\r\nbeing stripped off by the action of the bats, attaching and detaching\r\nthemselves by means of their hooked feet. At sunset, they fly off to\r\ntheir feeding-grounds, probably at a considerable distance, as it\r\nrequires a large area to furnish sufficient food for such multitudes.\r\n\r\nIn all its movements and attitudes, the action of the _Pteropus_\r\nis highly interesting. If placed upon the ground, it is almost\r\nhelpless, none of its limbs being calculated for progressive motion;\r\nit drags itself along by means of the hook attached to each of its\r\nextended thumbs, pushing at the same time with those of its hind feet.\r\nIts natural position is exclusively pensile; it moves laterally from\r\nbranch to branch with great ease, by using each foot alternately, and\r\nclimbs, when necessary, by means of its claws.\r\n\r\nWhen at rest, or asleep, the disposition of the limbs is most curious.\r\nAt such times it suspends itself by one foot only, bringing the other\r\nclose to its side, and thus it is enabled to wrap itself in the ample\r\nfolds of its wings, which envelop it like a mantle, leaving only its\r\nupturned head uncovered. Its fur is thus protected from damp and rain,\r\nand to some extent its body is sheltered from the sun.\r\n\r\nAs it collects its food by means of its mouth, either when on the\r\nwing, or when suspended within reach of it, the flying-fox is always\r\nmore or less liable to have the spoil wrested from it by its intrusive\r\ncompanions, before it can make good its way to some secure retreat in\r\nwhich to devour it unmolested. In such conflicts they bite viciously,\r\ntear each other with their hooks, and scream incessantly, till, taking\r\nto flight, the persecuted one reaches some place of safety, where he\r\nhangs by one foot, and grasping the fruit he has secured in the claws\r\nand opposable thumb of the other, he hastily reduces it to lumps, with\r\nwhich he stuffs his cheek pouches till they become distended like those\r\nof a monkey; then suspended in safety, he commences to chew and suck the\r\npieces, rejecting the refuse with his tongue.\r\n\r\nTo drink, which it does by lapping, the _Pteropus_ suspends\r\nitself head downwards from a branch above the water.\r\n\r\nInsects, caterpillars, birds' eggs, and young birds are devoured by\r\nthem; and the Singhalese say that the flying-fox will even attack a\r\ntree snake. It is killed by the natives for the sake of its flesh,\r\nwhich, I have been told by a gentleman who has eaten of it, resembles\r\nthat of the hare.[1] It is strongly attracted to the coconut trees\r\nduring the period when toddy is drawn for distillation, and exhibits,\r\nit is said, at such times, symptoms resembling intoxication.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In Western India the native Portuguese eat the\r\nflying-fox, and pronounce it delicate, and far from disagreeable in\r\nflavour.]\r\n\r\nNeither the flying-fox, nor any other bat that I know of in Ceylon,\r\never hybernates.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties (one of them peculiar to the island) of\r\nthe horse-shoe-headed _Rhinolophus_, with the strange leaf-like\r\nappendage erected on the extremity of the nose.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the insectivorous bats, though nocturnal,\r\nare deficient in that keen vision characteristic of animals which take\r\ntheir prey by night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RINOLOPHUS.]\r\n\r\nI doubt whether this conjecture be well founded; it certainly does not\r\napply to the _Pteropus_ and the other frugivorous species, in\r\nwhich the faculty of sight is singularly clear. As regards the others,\r\nit is possible that in their peculiar oeconomy some additional power\r\nmay be required to act in concert with that of vision, as in insects,\r\ntouch is superadded, in its most sensitive development, to that of\r\nsight. It is probable that the noseleaf, which forms an extended\r\nscreen stretched behind the nostrils in some of the bats, may be\r\nintended by nature to facilitate the collection and conduction of\r\nodours, just as the vast expansion of the shell of the ear in the same\r\nfamily is designed to assist in the collection of sounds--and thus to\r\nsupplement their vision when in pursuit of prey in the dusk by the\r\nsuperior sensitiveness of the organs of hearing and smell.\r\n\r\nOne tiny little bat, not much larger than the humble\r\nbee[1], and of a glossy black colour, is sometimes to be seen about\r\nColombo. It is so familiar and gentle that it will alight on the cloth\r\nduring dinner, and manifests so little alarm that it seldom makes any\r\neffort to escape before a wine glass can be inverted to secure it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is a _very_ small Singhalese variety of\r\nScotophilus Coromandelicus, _F. Cuv._]\r\n\r\nAlthough not strictly in order, this seems not an inappropriate place\r\nto notice one of the most curious peculiarities connected with the\r\nbats--their singular parasite, the Nycteribia.[1] On cursory\r\nobservation this creature appears to have neither head, antennæ, eyes,\r\nnor mouth; and the earlier observers of its structure satisfied\r\nthemselves that the place of the latter was supplied by a cylindrical\r\nsucker, which, being placed between the shoulders, the insect had no\r\noption but to turn on its back to feed. Another anomaly was thought to\r\ncompensate for this apparent inconvenience;--its three pairs of legs,\r\narmed with claws, are so arranged that they seem to be equally\r\ndistributed over its upper and under sides, the creature being thus\r\nenabled to use them like hands, and to grasp the strong hairs above it\r\nwhile extracting its nourishment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This extraordinary creature had formerly been discovered\r\nonly on a few European bats. Joínville figured one which he found on\r\nthe large roussette (the flying-fox), and says he had seen another on\r\na bat of the same family. Dr. Templeton observed them in Ceylon in\r\ngreat abundance on the fur of the _Scotophilus Coromandelicus_,\r\nand they will, no doubt, be found on many others.]\r\n\r\nIt moves, in fact, by rolling itself rapidly along, rotating like a\r\nwheel on the extremities of its spokes, or like the clown in a\r\npantomime, hurling himself forward on hands and feet alternately. Its\r\ncelerity is so great that Colonel Montague, who was one of the first\r\nto describe it minutely[1], says its speed exceeds that of any\r\nknown insect, and as its joints are so flexible as to yield in every\r\ndirection (like what mechanics call a \"ball and socket\"), its motions\r\nare exceedingly grotesque as it tumbles through the fur of the bat.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Celeripes vespertilionis, _Mont. Lin. Trans._ xi. p.11.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NYCTERBIA.]\r\n\r\nTo enable it to attain its marvellous velocity, each foot is armed\r\nwith two sharp hooks, with elastic opposable pads, so that the hair\r\ncan not only be rapidly seized and firmly held, but as quickly\r\ndisengaged, as the creature whirls away in its headlong career.\r\n\r\nThe insects to which it bears the nearest affinity, are the\r\n_Hippoboscidæ_, or \"spider flies,\" that infest birds and horses;\r\nbut, unlike them, the Nycteribia is unable to fly.\r\n\r\nIts strangest peculiarity, and that which gave rise to the belief that\r\nit was headless, is its faculty when at rest of throwing back its head\r\nand pressing it close between its shoulders till the under side\r\nbecomes uppermost, not a vestige of head being discernible where we\r\nwould naturally look for it, and the whole seeming but a casual\r\ninequality on its back.\r\n\r\nOn closer examination this, apparent tubercle is found to have a\r\nleathery attachment like a flexible neck, and by a sudden jerk the\r\nlittle creature is enabled to project it forward into its normal\r\nposition, when it is discovered to be furnished with a mouth, antennæ,\r\nand four eyes, two on each side.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of such an insect is a marvellous adaptation of\r\nphysical form to special circumstances. As the nycteribia has to make\r\nits way through fur and hairs, its feet are furnished with prehensile\r\nhooks that almost convert them into hands; and being obliged to conform\r\nto the sudden flights of its patron, and accommodate itself to inverted\r\npositions, all attitudes are rendered alike to it by the arrangement of its\r\nlimbs, which enables it, after every possible gyration, to find itself\r\nalways on its feet.\r\n\r\nIII. CARNIVORA.--_Bears_.--Of the _carnivora_, the one most\r\ndreaded by the natives of Ceylon, and the only one of the larger\r\nanimals that makes the depths of the forest its habitual retreat, is\r\nthe bear[1], attracted chiefly by the honey which is found in the\r\nhollow trees and clefts of the rocks. Occasionally spots of fresh\r\nearth are observed which have been turned up by the bears in search of\r\nsome favourite root. They feed also on the termites and ants. A friend\r\nof mine traversing the forest, near Jaffna, at early dawn, had his\r\nattention attracted by the growling of a bear, that was seated upon a\r\nlofty branch, thrusting portions of a red-ants' nest into his mouth\r\nwith one paw, whilst with the other he endeavoured to clear his\r\neyebrows and lips of the angry inmates, which bit and tortured him in\r\ntheir rage. The Ceylon bear is found in the low and dry districts of\r\nthe northern and south-eastern coast, and is seldom met with on the\r\nmountains or the moist and damp plains of the west. It is furnished\r\nwith a bushy tuft of hair on the back, between the shoulders, by which\r\nthe young are accustomed to cling till sufficiently strong to provide\r\nfor their own safety. During a severe drought that prevailed in the\r\nnorthern province in 1850, the district of Caretchy was so infested by\r\nbears that the Oriental custom of the women resorting to the wells was\r\naltogether suspended, as it was a common occurrence to find one of these\r\nanimals in the water, unable to climb up the yielding and slippery soil,\r\ndown which its thirst had impelled it to slide during the night.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Prochilus labiatus, _Blainville_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDIAN BEAR.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the structure of the bear shows him to be naturally omnivorous,\r\nhe rarely preys upon flesh in Ceylon, and his solitary habits whilst in\r\nsearch of honey and fruits render him timid and retiring. Hence he\r\nevinces alarm on the approach of man or other animals, and, unable to\r\nmake a rapid retreat, his panic, rather than any vicious disposition,\r\nleads him to become an assailant in self-defence. But so furious are his\r\nassaults under such circumstances that the Singhalese have a terror of\r\nhis attack greater than that created by any other beast of the forest.\r\nIf not armed with a gun, a native, in the places where bears abound,\r\nusually carries a light axe, called \"kodelly,\" with which to strike them\r\non the head. The bear, on the other hand, always aims at the face, and,\r\nif successful in prostrating his victim, usually commences by assailing\r\nthe eyes. I have met numerous individuals on our journeys who exhibited\r\nfrightful scars from such encounters, the white seams of their wounds\r\ncontrasting hideously with the dark colour of the rest of their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe Veddahs in Bintenne, whose principal stores consist of honey, live\r\nin dread of the bears, because, attracted by the perfume, they will\r\nnot hesitate to attack their rude dwellings, when allured by this\r\nirresistible temptation. The Post-office runners, who always travel by\r\nnight, are frequently exposed to danger from these animals, especially\r\nalong the coast from Putlam to Aripo, where they are found in\r\nconsiderable numbers; and, to guard against surprise, they are\r\naccustomed to carry flambeaux, to give warning to the bears, and\r\nenable them to shuffle out of the path.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Amongst the Singhalese there is a belief that certain\r\ncharms are efficacious in protecting them from the violence of bears,\r\nand those whose avocations expose them to encounters of this kind are\r\naccustomed to carry a talisman either attached to their neck or\r\nenveloped in the folds of their luxuriant hair. A friend of mine,\r\nwriting of an adventure which occurred at Anarajapoora, thus describes\r\nan occasion on which a Moor, who attended him, was somewhat, rudely\r\ndisabused of his belief in the efficacy of charms upon bears:--\"Desiring\r\nto change the position of a herd of deer, the Moorman (with his charm)\r\nwas sent across some swampy land to disturb them. As he was proceeding,\r\nwe saw him suddenly turn from an old tree and run back with all speed,\r\nhis hair becoming unfastened and like his clothes streaming in the wind.\r\nIt soon became evident that he was flying from some terrific object, for\r\nhe had thrown down his gun, and, in his panic, he was taking the\r\nshortest line towards us, which lay across a swamp covered with sedge\r\nand rushes that greatly impeded his progress, and prevented us\r\napproaching him, or seeing what was the cause of his flight. Missing his\r\nsteps from one hard spot to another he repeatedly fell into the water,\r\nbut he rose and resumed his flight. I advanced as far as the sods would\r\nbear my weight, but to go further was impracticable. Just within\r\nball-range there was an open space, and, as the man gained it. I saw\r\nthat he was pursued by a bear and two cubs. As the person of the\r\nfugitive covered the bear, it was impossible to fire without risk. At\r\nlast he fall exhausted, and the bear being close upon him, I discharged\r\nboth barrels. The first broke the bear's shoulder, but this only made\r\nher more savage, and rising on her hind legs she advanced with ferocious\r\nprowls, when the second barrel, though I do not think it took effect,\r\nserved to frighten her, for turning round she retreated, followed by the\r\ncubs. Some natives then waded through the mud to the Moorman, who was\r\njust exhausted, and would have been drowned but that he fell with his\r\nhead upon a tuft of grass: the poor man was unable to speak, and for\r\nseveral weeks his intellect seemed confused. The adventure sufficed to\r\nsatisfy him that he could not again depend upon a charm to protect him,\r\nfrom bears, though he always insisted that but for its having fallen\r\nfrom his hair where he had fastened it under his turban, the bear would\r\nnot have ventured to attack him.\"]\r\n\r\nLeopards[1] are the only formidable members of the tiger race in\r\nCeylon[2], and they are neither very numerous nor very dangerous, as\r\nthey seldom attack man. By the Europeans, the Ceylon leopard is\r\nerroneously called a _cheetah_, but the true \"cheetah\" (_felis\r\njubata_),' the hunting leopard of India, does not exist in the\r\nisland.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Felis pardus, _Linn._ What is called a leopard, or a\r\ncheetah, in Ceylon, is in reality the true panther.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A belief is prevalent at Trincomalie that a Bengal tiger\r\ninhabits the jungle in its vicinity; and the story runs that it\r\nescaped from the wreck of a vessel on which it had been embarked for\r\nEngland. Officers of the Government state positively that they have\r\nmore than once come on it whilst hunting; and one gentleman of the\r\nRoyal Engineers, who had seen it, assured me that he could not be\r\nmistaken as to its being a tiger of India, and one of the largest\r\ndescription.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mr. BAKER, in his _Eight Years in Ceylon_, has\r\nstated that there are two species of leopard in the island, one of\r\nwhich he implies is the Indian cheetah. But although he specifies\r\ndiscrepancies in size, weight, and marking between the varieties which\r\nhe has examined, his data are not sufficient to identify any of them\r\nwith the true _felis jubata_.]\r\n\r\nThere is a rare variety of the leopard which has been found in various\r\nparts of the island, in which the skin, instead of being spotted, is of\r\na uniform black.[1] Leopards frequent the vicinity of pasture hinds in\r\nquest of the deer and other peaceful animals which resort to them; and\r\nthe villagers often complain of the destruction of their cattle by these\r\nformidable marauders. In relation to them, the natives have a curious\r\nbut firm conviction that when a bullock is killed by a leopard, and, in\r\nexpiring, falls so that _its right side is undermost_, the leopard will\r\nnot return to devour it. I have been told by English sportsmen (some of\r\nwhom share in the popular belief), that sometimes, when they have\r\nproposed to watch by the carcase of a bullock recently killed by a\r\nleopard, in the hope of shooting the spoiler on his return in search of\r\nhis prey, the native owner of the slaughtered animal, though earnestly\r\ndesiring to be avenged, has assured them that it would be in vain, as\r\nthe beast having fallen on its right side, the leopard not return.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: F. melas, _Peron_ and _Leseur_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEOPARD AND CHEETAH.]\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese hunt them for the sake of their extremely beautiful\r\nskins, but prefer taking them in traps and pitfalls, and occasionally\r\nin spring cages formed of poles driven firmly into the ground, within\r\nwhich a kid is generally fastened as a bait; the door being held open\r\nby a sapling bent down by the united force of several men, and so\r\narranged as to act as a spring, to which a noose is ingeniously\r\nattached, formed of plaited deer's hide. The cries of the kid attract\r\nthe leopard, which being tempted to enter, is enclosed by the\r\nliberation of the spring, and grasped firmly round the body by the\r\nnoose.\r\n\r\nLike the other carnivora, leopards are timid and cowardly in the\r\npresence of man, never intruding on him voluntarily, and making a\r\nhasty retreat when approached. Instances have, however, occurred of\r\nindividuals having been slain by them; and it is believed, that,\r\nhaving once tasted human blood, they, like the tiger, acquire an\r\nhabitual relish for it. A peon, on duty by night at the court-house of\r\nAnarajapoora, was some years ago carried off by a leopard from a table\r\nin the verandah on which he had laid down his head to sleep. At\r\nBatticaloa a \"cheetah\" in two instances in succession was known to\r\ncarry off men placed on a stage erected in a tree to drive away\r\nelephants from rice-land: but such cases are rare, and, as compared\r\nwith their dread of the bear, the natives of Ceylon entertain but\r\nslight apprehensions of the \"cheetah.\" It is, however, the dread of\r\nsportsmen, whose dogs when beating in the jungle are especially\r\nexposed to its attacks: and I am aware of an instance in which a party\r\nhaving tied their dogs to the tent-pole for security, and fallen\r\nasleep round them, a leopard sprang into the tent and carried\r\noff a dog from the midst of its slumbering masters. On one occasion\r\nbeing in the mountains near Kandy, a messenger despatched to me\r\nthrough the jungle excused his delay by stating that a \"cheetah\" had\r\nseated itself in the only practicable path, and remained quietly\r\nlicking its fore paws and rubbing them over its face, till he was\r\nforced to drive it, with stones, into the forest.\r\n\r\nLeopards are strongly attracted by the peculiar odour which\r\naccompanies small-pox. The reluctance of the natives to submit\r\nthemselves or their children to vaccination exposes the island to\r\nfrightful visitations of this disease; and in the villages in the\r\ninterior it is usual on such occasions to erect huts in the jungle to\r\nserve as temporary hospitals. Towards these the leopards are certain\r\nto be allured; and the medical officers are obliged to resort to\r\nincreased precautions in consequence. This fact is connected with a\r\ncurious native superstition. Amongst the avenging scourges sent direct\r\nfrom the gods, the Singhalese regard both the ravages of the leopard,\r\nand the visitation of the small-pox. The latter they call _par\r\nexcellence \"maha ledda_,\" the great \"sickness;\" they look upon it\r\nas a special manifestation of _devidosay_, \"the displeasure of\r\nthe gods;\" and the attraction of the cheetahs to the bed of the\r\nsufferer they attribute to the same indignant agency. A few years ago,\r\nthe capua, or demon-priest of a \"dewale,\" at Oggalbodda, a village\r\nnear Caltura, when suffering under small-pox, was devoured by a\r\ncheetah, and his fate was regarded by those of an opposite faith as a\r\nspecial judgment from heaven.\r\n\r\nSuch is the awe inspired by this belief in connection with the\r\nsmall-pox, that a person afflicted with it is always approached as one\r\nin immediate communication with the deity; his attendants, address him\r\nas \"my lord,\" and \"your lordship,\" and exhaust on him the whole series\r\nof honorific epithets in which their language abounds for approaching\r\npersonages of the most exalted rank. At evening and morning, a lamp is\r\nlighted before him, and invoked with prayers to protect his family from\r\nthe dire calamity which has befallen himself. And after his recovery,\r\nhis former associates refrain from communication with him until a\r\nceremony shall have been performed by the capua, called\r\n_awasara-pandema_, or \"the offering of lights for permission,\" the\r\nobject of which is to entreat permission of the deity to regard him as\r\nfreed from the divine displeasure, with liberty to his friends to renew\r\ntheir intercourse as before.\r\n\r\nMajor SKINNER, who for upwards of forty years has had occasionally to\r\nlive for long periods in the interior, occupied in the prosecution of\r\nsurveys and the construction of roads, is strongly of opinion that the\r\ndisposition of the leopard towards man is essentially pacific, and\r\nthat, when discovered, its natural impulse is to effect its escape. In\r\nillustration of this I insert an extract from one of his letters,\r\nwhich describes an adventure highly characteristic of this instinctive\r\ntimidity:--\r\n\r\n\"On the occasion of one of my visits to Adam's Peak, in the prosecution\r\nof my military reconnoissances of the mountain zone, I fixed on a pretty\r\nlittle patena (_i.e._, meadow) in the midst of an extensive and dense\r\nforest in the southern segment of the Peak Range, as a favourable spot\r\nfor operations. It would have been difficult, after descending from the\r\ncone of the peak, to have found one's way to this point, in the midst of\r\nso vast a wilderness of trees, had not long experience assured me that\r\ngood game tracks would be found leading to it, and by one of them I\r\nreached it. It was in the afternoon, just after one of those tropical\r\nsunshowers that decorate every branch and blade with pendant brilliants,\r\nand the little patena was covered with game, either driven to the open\r\nspace by the drippings from the leaves or tempted by the freshness of\r\nthe pasture: there were several pairs of elk, the bearded antlered male\r\ncontrasting finely with his mate; and other varieties of game in a\r\nprofusion not to be found in any place frequented by man. It was some\r\ntime before I would allow them to be disturbed by the rude fall of the\r\naxe, in our necessity to establish our bivouac for the night, and they\r\nwere so unaccustomed to danger that it was long before they took alarm\r\nat our noises.\r\n\r\n\"The following morning, anxious to gain a height for my observations\r\nin time to avail myself of the clear atmosphere of sunrise, I started\r\noff by myself through the jungle, leaving orders for my men, with my\r\nsurveying instruments, to follow my track by the notches which I cut\r\nin the bark of the trees. On leaving the plain, I availed myself of a\r\nfine wide game track which lay in my direction, and had gone, perhaps,\r\nhalf a mile from the camp, when I was startled by a slight rustling in\r\nthe nilloo[1] to my right, and in another instant, by the spring of a\r\nmagnificent leopard, which, in a bound of full eight feet in height\r\nover the lower brushwood, lighted at my feet within eighteen inches of\r\nthe spot whereon I stood, and lay in a crouching position, his fiery\r\ngleaming eyes fixed on me.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A species of one of the suffruticose _Acanthaccæ_\r\n(Strobilanthes), which grows, abundantly in the mountain ranges of\r\nCeylon.]\r\n\r\n\"The predicament was not a pleasant one. I had no weapon of defence, and\r\nwith one spring or blow of his paw the beast could have annihilated me.\r\nTo move I knew would only encourage his attack. It occurred to me at the\r\nmoment that I had heard of the power of man's eye over wild animals, and\r\naccordingly I fixed my gaze as intently as the agitation of such a\r\nmoment enabled me on his eyes: we stared at each other for some seconds,\r\nwhen, to my inexpressible joy, the beast turned and bounded down the\r\nstraight open path before me. This scene occurred just at that period of\r\nthe morning when the grazing animals retired from the open patena to the\r\ncool shade of the forest: doubtless, the leopard had taken my approach\r\nfor that of a deer, or some such animal. And if his spring had been at a\r\nquadruped instead of a biped, his distance was so well measured, that it\r\nmust have landed him on the neck of a deer, an elk, or a buffalo; as it\r\nwas, one pace more would have done for me. A bear would not have let his\r\nvictim off so easily.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the unequalled agility of the monkey, it falls a prey,\r\nand not unfrequently, to the leopard. The latter, on approaching a tree\r\non which a troop of monkeys have taken shelter, causes an instant and\r\nfearful excitement, which they manifest by loud and continued screams,\r\nand incessant restless leaps from branch to branch. The leopard\r\nmeanwhile walks round and round the tree, with his eyes firmly fixed\r\nupon his victims, till at last exhausted by terror, and prostrated by\r\nvain exertions to escape, one or more falls a prey to his voracity. So\r\nrivetted is the attention of both during the struggle, that a sportsman,\r\non one occasion, attracted by the noise, was enabled to approach within\r\nan uncomfortable distance of the leopard, before he discovered the cause\r\nof the unusual dismay amongst the monkeys overhead.\r\n\r\nIt is said, but I have never been able personally to verify the fact,\r\nthat the leopard of Ceylon exhibits a peculiarity in being unable\r\nentirely to retract its claws within their sheaths.\r\n\r\nThere is another piece of curious folk lore, in connexion with the\r\nleopard. The natives assert that it devours the _kaolin_ clay\r\ncalled by them _kiri-mattie_[1] in a very peculiar way. They say\r\nthat the cheetah places it in lumps beside him, and then gazes\r\nintently on the sun, till on turning his eyes on the clay, every piece\r\nappears of a red colour like flesh, when he instantly devours it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Sir J.E. TENNENT'S _Ceylon_, vol. i. p. 31.]\r\n\r\nThey likewise allege that the female cheetah never produces more than\r\none litter of whelps.\r\n\r\nOf the _lesser feline species_, the number and variety in Ceylon\r\nis inferior to those of India. The Palm-cat[1] lurks by day among the\r\nfronds of the coco-nut palms, and by night makes destructive forays on\r\nthe fowls of the villagers; and, in order to suck the blood of its\r\nvictim, inflicts a wound so small as to be almost imperceptible. The\r\nglossy genette[2], the \"_Civet_\" of Europeans, is common in the\r\nnorthern province, where the Tamils confine it in cages for the sake\r\nof its musk, which they collect from the wooden bars on which it rubs\r\nitself. Edrisi, the Moorish geographer, writing in the twelfth\r\ncentury, enumerates musk as one of the productions then exported from\r\nCeylon.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Paradoxurus typus, _F. Cuv._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Viverra Indica, _Geoffr., Hodgs._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: EDRISI, _Géogr._ sec. vii. Jauberts's translation,\r\nt. ii. p. 72. In connexion with cats, a Singhalese gentleman has\r\ndescribed to me a plant in Ceylon, called _Cuppa-mayniya_ by the\r\nnatives; by which he says cats are so enchanted, that they play with\r\nit as they would with, a captured mouse; throwing if into the air,\r\nwatching it till it falls, and crouching to see if it will move. It\r\nwould be worth inquiring into the truth of this; and the explanation\r\nof the attraction.]\r\n\r\n_Dogs_.--There is no native wild dog in Ceylon, but every village\r\nand town is haunted by mongrels of European descent, that are known by\r\nthe generic description of _Pariahs_. They are a miserable race,\r\nlean, wretched, and mangy, acknowledged by no owners, living on the\r\ngarbage of the streets and sewers, and if spoken to unexpectedly they\r\nshrink with an almost involuntary cry. Yet in these persecuted\r\noutcasts there survives that germ of instinctive affection which binds\r\nthe dog to the human race, and a gentle word, even a look of\r\ncompassionate kindness, is sufficient foundation for a lasting\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese, from their religious aversion to taking away life in any\r\nform, permit the increase of these desolate creatures till in the hot\r\nseason they become so numerous as to be a nuisance; and the only\r\nexpedient hitherto devised by the civil government to reduce their\r\nnumbers, is once in each year to offer a reward for their destruction,\r\nwhen the Tamils and Malays pursue them in the streets with clubs (guns\r\nbeing forbidden by the police for fear of accidents), and the\r\nunresisting dogs are beaten to death on the side-paths and door-steps\r\nwhere they had been taught to resort for food. Lord Torrington, during\r\nhis government of Ceylon, attempted the more civilised experiment of\r\nputting some check on their numbers, by imposing a dog-tax, the effect\r\nof which would have been to lead to the drowning of puppies; whereas\r\nthere is reason to believe that dogs are at present _bred_ by the\r\nhorse-keepers to be killed for sake of the reward.\r\n\r\nThe Pariahs of Colombo exhibit something of the same instinct, by\r\nwhich the dogs in other eastern cities partition the towns into\r\ndistricts, each apportioned to a separate pack, by whom it is\r\njealously guarded from the encroachments of all intruders. Travellers\r\nat Cairo and Constantinople are often startled at night by the racket\r\noccasioned by the demonstrations made by the rightful possessors of a\r\nlocality in repelling its invasion by some straggling wanderer. At\r\nAlexandria, in 1844, the dogs had multiplied to such an inconvenient\r\nextent, that Mehemet Ali, to abate the nuisance, caused them to be\r\nshipped in boats and conveyed to one of the islands at the mouth of\r\nthe Nile. But the streets, thus deprived of their habitual patroles,\r\nwere speedily infested by dogs from the suburbs, in such numbers that\r\nthe evil became greater than before, and in the following year, the\r\nlegitimate denizens were recalled from their exile in the Delta, and\r\nspeedily drove back the intruders within their original boundary. May\r\nnot this disposition of the dog be referable to the impulse by which,\r\nin a state of nature, each pack appropriates its own hunting-fields\r\nwithin a particular area? and may not the impulse which, even in a\r\nstate of domestication, they still manifest to attack a passing dog\r\nupon the road, be a remnant of this localised instinct, and a\r\nconcomitant dislike of intrusion?\r\n\r\n_Jackal_.--The Jackal[1] in the low country of Ceylon hunts thus in\r\npacks, headed by a leader, and these audacious prowlers have been seen\r\nto assault and pull down a deer. The small number of hares in the\r\ndistricts they infest is ascribed to their depredations. In the legends\r\nof the natives, and in the literature of the Buddhists, the jackal in\r\nCeylon is as essentially the type of cunning as the fox is the emblem of\r\ncraft and adroitness in the traditions of Europe. In fact, it is more\r\nthan doubtful whether the jackal of the East be not the creature alluded\r\nto, in the various passages of the Sacred Writings which make allusion\r\nto the artfulness and subtlety of the \"fox.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Canis Aureus, _Linn._]\r\n\r\nThese faculties they display in a high degree in their hunting\r\nexpeditions, especially in the northern portions of the island, where\r\nthey are found in the greatest numbers. In these districts, where the\r\nwide sandy plains are thinly covered with brushwood, the face of the\r\ncountry is diversified by patches of thick jungle and detached groups\r\nof trees, that form insulated groves and topes. At dusk, or after\r\nnightfall, a pack of jackals, having watched a hare or a small deer\r\ntake refuge in one of these retreats, immediately surround it on all\r\nsides; and having stationed a few to watch the path by which the game\r\nentered, the leader commences the attack by raising the unearthly cry\r\npeculiar to their race, and which resembles the sound _okkay!_\r\nloudly and rapidly repeated. The whole party then rush into the\r\njungle, and drive out the victim, which generally falls into the\r\nambush previously laid to entrap it.\r\n\r\nA native gentleman[1], who had favourable opportunities of observing the\r\nmovements of these animals, informed me, that when a jackal has brought\r\ndown his game and killed it, his first impulse is to hide it in the\r\nnearest jungle, whence he issues with an air of easy indifference to\r\nobserve whether anything more powerful than himself may be at hand, from\r\nwhich he might encounter the risk of being despoiled of his capture. If\r\nthe coast be clear, he returns to the concealed carcase, and carries it\r\naway, followed by his companions. But if a man be in sight, or any other\r\nanimal to be avoided, my informant has seen the jackal seize a coco-nut\r\nhusk in his mouth, or any similar substance, and fly at full speed, as\r\nif eager to carry off his pretended prize, returning for the real booty\r\nat some more convenient season.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. D. de Silva Gooneratné.]\r\n\r\nThey are subject to hydrophobia, and instances are frequent in Ceylon\r\nof cattle being bitten by them and dying in consequence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JACKAL'S SKULL AND HORN]\r\n\r\nAn excrescence is sometimes found on the head of the jackal, consisting\r\nof a small horny cone about half an inch in length, and concealed by a\r\ntuft of hair. This the natives call _narrie-comboo_; and they aver that\r\nthis \"Jackal's Horn\" only grows on the head of the leader of the\r\npack.[1] Both the Singhalese and the Tamils regard it as a talisman, and\r\nbelieve that its fortunate possessor can command by its instrumentality\r\nthe realisation of every wish, and that if stolen or lost by him, it\r\nwill invariably return of its own accord. Those who have jewels to\r\nconceal rest in perfect security if along with them they can deposit a\r\nnarri-comboo, fully convinced that its presence is an effectual\r\nsafeguard against robbers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the Museum of the College of Surgeons, London (No.\r\n4362 A), there is a cranium of a jackal which exhibits this strange\r\nosseous process on the super-occipital; and I have placed along with\r\nit a specimen of the horny sheath, which was presented to me by Mr.\r\nLavalliere, the late district judge of Kandy.]\r\n\r\nOne fabulous virtue ascribed to the _narrie-comboo_ by the Singhalese is\r\nabsurdly characteristic of their passion for litigation, as well as of\r\ntheir perceptions of the \"glorious uncertainty of the law.\" It is the\r\npopular belief that the fortunate discoverer of a jackal's horn becomes\r\nthereby invincible in every lawsuit, and must irresistibly triumph over\r\nevery opponent. A gentleman connected \"with the Supreme Court of Colombo\r\nhas repeated to me a circumstance, within his own knowledge, of a\r\nplaintiff who, after numerous defeats, eventually succeeded against his\r\nopponent by the timely acquisition of this invaluable charm. Before the\r\nfinal hearing of the cause, the mysterious horn was duly exhibited to\r\nhis friends; and the consequence was, that the adverse witnesses,\r\nappalled by the belief that no one could possibly give judgment against\r\na person so endowed, suddenly modified their previous evidence, and\r\nsecured an unforeseen victory for the happy owner of the\r\n_narrie-comboo!_\r\n\r\n_The Mongoos_.--Of the Mongoos or Ichneumon four species have been\r\ndescribed; and one, that frequents the hills near Neuera-ellia[1], is so\r\nremarkable from its bushy fur, that the invalid soldiers in the\r\nsanatarium there, to whom it is familiar, have given it the name of the\r\n\"Ceylon Badger.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Herpestes vitticollis_. Mr. W. ELLIOTT, in his _Catalogue\r\nof Mammalia found in the Southern Maharata Country_, Madras, 1840, says,\r\nthat \"One specimen of this Herpestes was procured by accident in the\r\nGhât forests in 1829, and is now deposited in the British Museum; it is\r\nvery rare, inhabiting only the thickest woods, and its habits are very\r\nlittle known,\" p. 9. In Ceylon it is comparatively common.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERPESTES VITTICOLLIS.]\r\n\r\nI have found universally that the natives of Ceylon attach no credit to\r\nthe European story of the Mongoos (_H. griseus_) resorting to some\r\nplant, which no one has yet succeeded in identifying, as an antidote\r\nagainst the bite of the venomous serpents on which it preys: There is no\r\ndoubt that, in its conflicts with the cobra de capello and other\r\npoisonous snakes, which it attacks with as little hesitation as the\r\nharmless ones, it may be seen occasionally to retreat, and even to\r\nretire into the jungle, and, it is added, to eat some vegetable; but a\r\ngentleman, who has been a frequent observer of its exploits, assures me\r\nthat most usually the herb it resorted to was grass; and if this were\r\nnot at hand, almost any other plant that grew near seemed equally\r\nacceptable. Hence has probably arisen the long list of plants, such as\r\nthe _Ophioxylon serpentinum_ and _Ophiorhiza mungos_, the _Aristolochia\r\nIndica_, the _Mimosa octandria_, and others, each of which has been\r\nasserted to be the ichneumon's specific; whilst their multiplicity is\r\ndemonstrative of the non-existence of any one in particular on which the\r\nanimal relies as an antidote. Were there any truth in the tale as\r\nregards the mongoos, it would be difficult to understand why creatures,\r\nsuch as the secretary bird and the falcon, and others, which equally\r\ndestroy serpents, should be left defenceless, and the ichneumon alone\r\nprovided with a prophylactic. Besides, were the ichneumon inspired by\r\nthat courage which would result from the consciousness of security, it\r\nwould be so indifferent to the bite of the serpent that we might\r\nconclude that, both in its approaches and its assault, it would be\r\nutterly careless as to the precise mode of its attack. Such, however, is\r\nfar from being the case: and next to its audacity, nothing can be more\r\nsurprising than the adroitness with which it escapes the spring of the\r\nsnake under a due sense of danger, and the cunning with which it makes\r\nits arrangements to leap upon the back and fasten its teeth in the head\r\nof the cobra. It is this display of instinctive ingenuity that Lucan[1]\r\ncelebrates where he paints the ichneumon diverting the attention of the\r\nasp, by the motion of his bushy tail, and then seizing it in the midst\r\nof its confusion:--\r\n\r\n  \"Aspidas ut Pharias caudâ solertior hostis\r\n  Ludit, et iratas incertâ provocat umbrâ:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The passage in Lucan is a versification of the same\r\nnarrative related by Pliny, lib. viii. ch. 53; and Ælian, lib. iii. ch.\r\n22.]\r\n\r\n  Obliquusque caput vanas serpentis in auras\r\n  Effuse toto comprendit guttura morsu\r\n  Letiferam citra saniem; tunc irrita pestis\r\n  Exprimitur, faucesque fluunt pereunte veneno.\"\r\n                      _Pharsalia_, lib. iv. v. 729.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the mongoos and its antidote has been referred to the\r\nsupposition that there may be some peculiarity in its organisation which\r\nrenders it _proof against_ the poison of the serpent. It remains for\r\nfuture investigation to determine how far this conjecture is founded in\r\ntruth; and whether in the blood of the mongoos there exists any element\r\nor quality which acts as a prophylactic. Such exceptional provisions are\r\nnot without precedent in the animal oeconomy: the hornbill feeds with\r\nimpunity on the deadly fruit of the strychnos; the milky juice of some\r\nspecies of euphorbia, which is harmless to oxen, is invariably fatal to\r\nthe zebra; and the tsetse fly, the pest of South Africa, whose bite is\r\nmortal to the ox, the dog, and the horse, is harmless to man and the\r\nuntamed creatures of the forest.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. LIVINGSTONE, _Tour in S. Africa_, p. 80. Is it a fact\r\nthat, in America, pigs extirpate the rattlesnakes with impunity?]\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese distinguish one species of mongoos, which they designate\r\n\"_Hotambeya_\" and which they assert never preys upon serpents. A writer\r\nin the _Ceylon Miscellany_ mentions, that they are often to be seen\r\n\"crossing rivers and frequently mud-brooks near Chilaw; the adjacent\r\nthickets affording them shelter, and their food consisting of aquatic\r\nreptiles, crabs, and mollusca.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is possibly the \"musbilai\" or mouse-cat of Behar,\r\nwhich preys upon birds and fish. Can it be the Urva of the Nepalese\r\n(_Urva cancrivora_, Hodgson), which Mr. Hodgson describes as dwelling in\r\nburrows, and being carnivorous and ranivorous?--Vide _Journ. As. Soc.\r\nBeng._ vol. vi. p. 56.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLYING SQUIRREL.]\r\n\r\nIV. RODENTIA. _Squirrels_.--Smaller animals in great numbers enliven the\r\nforests and lowland plains with their graceful movements. Squirrels[1],\r\nof which there are a great variety, make their shrill metallic call\r\nheard at early morning in the woods; and when sounding their note of\r\nwarning on the approach of a civet or a tree-snake, the ears tingle with\r\nthe loud trill of defiance, which rings as clear and rapid as the\r\nrunning down of an alarum, and is instantly caught up and re-echoed from\r\nevery side by their terrified playmates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Of two kinds which frequent the mountains, one which is\r\npeculiar to Ceylon was discovered by Mr. Edgar L. Layard, who has done\r\nme the honour to call it the _Sciurus Tennentii_. Its dimensions are\r\nlarge, measuring upwards of two feet from head to tail. It is\r\ndistinguished from the _S. macrurus_ by the predominant black colour of\r\nthe upper surface of the body, with the exception of a rusty spot at the\r\nbase of the ears.]\r\n\r\nOne of the largest, belonging to a closely allied subgenus, is known as\r\nthe \"Flying Squirrel,\"[1] from its being assisted, in its prodigious\r\nleaps from tree to tree, by a parachute formed by the skin of the\r\nflanks, which, on the extension of the limbs front and rear, is\r\nlaterally expanded from foot to foot. Thus buoyed up in its descent, the\r\nspring which it is enabled to make from one lofty tree to another\r\nresembles the flight of a bird rather than the bound of a quadruped.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pteromys oral., _Tickel_. P. petaurista, _Pallas_.]\r\n\r\nOf these pretty creatures there are two species, one common to Ceylon\r\nand India, the other (_Sciuropterus Layardii_, Kelaart) is peculiar to\r\nthe island, and by far the most beautiful of the family.\r\n\r\n_Rats_.--Among the multifarious inhabitants to which the forest affords\r\nat once a home and provender is the tree rat[1], which forms its nest on\r\nthe branches, and by turns makes its visits to the dwellings of the\r\nnatives, frequenting the ceilings in preference to the lower parts of\r\nhouses. Here it is incessantly followed by the rat-snake[2], whose\r\ndomestication is encouraged by the servants, in consideration of its\r\nservices in destroying vermin. I had one day an opportunity of\r\nsurprising a snake that had just seized on a rat of this description,\r\nand of covering it suddenly with a glass shade, before it had time to\r\nswallow its prey. The serpent, appeared stunned by its own capture, and\r\nallowed the rat to escape from its jaws, which cowered at one side of\r\nthe glass in the most pitiable state of trembling terror. The two were\r\nleft alone for some moments, and on my return to them the snake was as\r\nbefore in the same attitude of sullen stupor. On setting them at\r\nliberty, the rat bounded towards the nearest fence; but quick as\r\nlightning it was followed by its pursuer, which seized it before it\r\ncould gain the hedge, through which I saw the snake glide with its\r\nvictim in its jaws. In parts of the central province, at Oovah and\r\nBintenne, the house-rat is eaten as a common article of food. The\r\nSinghalese believe it and the mouse to be liable to hydrophobia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There are two species of the tree rat in Ceylon: M.\r\nrufescens, _Gray_; (M. flavescens, _Elliot_;) and Mus nemoralis,\r\n_Blyth_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Coryphodon Blumenbachii, _Merr_.]\r\n\r\nAnother indigenous variety of the rat is that which made its appearance\r\nfor the first time in the coffee plantations on the Kandyan hills in the\r\nyear 1847; and in such swarms does it continue to infest them, at\r\nintervals, that as many as a thousand have been killed in a single day\r\non one estate. In order to reach the buds and blossoms of the coffee, it\r\ncuts such of the slender branches as would not sustain its weight, and\r\nfeeds on them when fallen to the ground; and so delicate and sharp are\r\nits incisors, that the twigs thus destroyed are detached by as clean a\r\ncut as if severed with a knife.\r\n\r\nThe coffee-rat[1] is an insular variety of the _Mus hirsutus_ of W.\r\nElliot, found in Southern India. They inhabit the forests, making their\r\nnests among the roots of the trees, and feeding, in the season, on the\r\nripe seeds of the nilloo. Like the lemmings of Norway and Lapland, they\r\nmigrate in vast numbers on the occurrence of a scarcity of their\r\nordinary food. The Malabar coolies are so fond of their flesh, that they\r\nevince a preference for those districts in which the coffee plantations\r\nare subject to their incursions, where they fry the rats in coco-nut\r\noil, or convert them into curry.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Golunda Ellioti, _Gray_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COFFEE RAT.]\r\n\r\n_Bandicoot_.--Another favourite article of food with the coolies is the\r\npig-rat or Bandicoot[1], which attains on those hills the weight of two\r\nor three pounds, and grows to nearly the length of two feet. As it feeds\r\non grain and roots, its flesh is said to be delicate, and much\r\nresembling young pork.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mus bandicota, _Beckst._ The English term bandicoot is a\r\ncorruption of the Telinga name _pandikoku_, literally _pig-rat_.]\r\n\r\nIts nests, when rifled, are frequently found to contain considerable\r\nquantities of rice, stored up against the dry season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BANDICOOT.]\r\n\r\n_Porcupine_.--The Porcupine[1] is another of the _rodentia_ which has\r\ndrawn down upon itself the hostility of the planters, from its\r\ndestruction of the young coconut palms, to which it is a pernicious and\r\npersevering, but withal so crafty, a visitor, that it is with difficulty\r\nany trap can be so disguised, or any bait made so alluring, as to lead\r\nto its capture. The usual expedient in Ceylon is to place some of its\r\nfavourite food at the extremity of a trench, so narrow as to prevent the\r\nporcupine turning, whilst the direction of his quills effectually bars\r\nhis retreat backwards. On a newly planted coconut tope, at Hang-welle,\r\nwithin a few miles of Colombo, I have heard of as many as twenty-seven\r\nbeing thus captured in a single night; but such success is rare. The\r\nmore ordinary expedient is to smoke them out by burning straw at the\r\napertures of their burrows. At Ootacamund, on the continent of the\r\nDekkan, spring-guns have been used with great success by the\r\nSuperintendent of the Horticultural Gardens; placing them so as to sweep\r\nthe runs of the porcupines. The flesh is esteemed a delicacy in Ceylon,\r\nand in consistency, colour, and flavour it very much resembles young\r\npork.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Hystrix leucurus, _Sykes_.]\r\n\r\nV. EDENTATA. _Pengolin_.--Of the Edentata the only example in Ceylon is\r\nthe scaly ant-eater, called by the Singhalese, Caballaya, but usually\r\nknown by its Malay name of _Pengolin_[1], a word indicative of its\r\nfaculty, when alarmed, of \"rolling itself up\" into a compact ball, by\r\nbending its head towards its stomach, arching its back into a circle,\r\nand securing all by a powerful fold of its mail-covered tail. The feet\r\nof the pengolin are armed with powerful claws, which in walking they\r\ndouble in, like the ant-eater of Brazil. These they use in extracting\r\ntheir favourite food from ant-hills and decaying wood. When at liberty,\r\nthey burrow in the dry ground to a depth of seven or eight feet, where\r\nthey reside in pairs, and produce annually one or two young.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Manis pentadactyla, _Linn._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: I am assured that there is a hedge-hog in Ceylon; but as I\r\nhave never seen it, I cannot tell whether it belongs to either of the\r\ntwo species known in India (_Erinaceus mentalis_ and _E. collaris_)--nor\r\ncan I vouch for its existence there at all. But the fact was told to me,\r\nin connexion with the statement, that its favourite dwelling is in the\r\nsame burrow with the pengolin. The popular belief in this is attested by\r\na Singhalese proverb, in relation to an intrusive personage; the import\r\nof which is that he is like \"_a hedge-hog in the den of a pengolin_.\"]\r\n\r\nOf two specimens which I kept alive at different times, one, about two\r\nfeet in length, from the vicinity of Kandy, was a gentle and affectionate\r\ncreature, which, after wandering over the house in search of ants, would\r\nattract attention to its wants by climbing up my knee, laying hold of my\r\nleg with its prehensile tail. The other, more than double that length,\r\nwas caught in the jungle near Chilaw, and brought to me in Colombo. I\r\nhad always understood that the pengolin was unable to climb trees; but\r\nthe one last mentioned frequently ascended a tree in my garden, in\r\nsearch of ants; and this it effected by means of its hooked feet, aided\r\nby an oblique grasp of the tail. The ants it seized by extending its\r\nround and glutinous tongue along their tracks; and in the stomach of one\r\nwhich was opened after death, I found a quantity of small stones and\r\ngravel, which had been taken to facilitate digestion. In both specimens\r\nin my possession the scales of the back were a cream-coloured white,\r\nwith a tinge of red in that which came from Chilaw, probably acquired by\r\nthe insinuation of the Cabook dust which abounds along the western coast\r\nof the island.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PENGOLIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF PENGOLIN.]\r\n\r\nOf the habits of the pengolin I found that very little was known by the\r\nnatives, who regard it with aversion, one name given to it being the\r\n\"Negombo Devil.\" Those kept by me were, generally speaking, quiet during\r\nthe day, and grew restless and active as evening and night approached.\r\nBoth had been taken near rocks, in the hollows of which they had their\r\ndwelling, but owing to their slow power of motion, they were unable to\r\nreach their hiding place when overtaken. When frightened, they rolled\r\nthemselves instantly into a rounded ball; and such was the powerful\r\nforce of muscle, that the strength of a man was insufficient to uncoil\r\nit. In reconnoitring they made important use of the tail, resting upon\r\nit and their hind legs, and holding themselves nearly erect, to command\r\na view of their object. The strength of this powerful limb will be\r\nperceived from the accompanying drawing of the skeleton of the Manis; in\r\nwhich it will be seen that the tail is equal in length to all the rest\r\nof the body, whilst the vertebræ which compose it are stronger by far\r\nthan those of the back.\r\n\r\nFrom the size and position of the bones of the leg, the pengolin is\r\nendued with prodigious power; and its faculty of exerting this\r\nvertically, was displayed in overturning heavy cases, by insinuating\r\nitself under them, between the supports, by which it is customary in\r\nCeylon to raise trunks a few inches above the floor, in order to prevent\r\nthe attacks of white ants.\r\n\r\nVI. RUMINANTIA. _The Gaur_.--Besides the deer, and some varieties of the\r\nhumped ox, that have been introduced from the opposite continent of\r\nIndia, Ceylon has probably but one other indigenous bovine _ruminant_,\r\nthe buffalo.[1] There is a tradition that the gaur, found in the\r\nextremity of the Indian peninsula, was at one period a native of the\r\nKandyan Mountains; but as Knox speaks of one which in his time \"was kept\r\namong the king's creatures\" at Kandy[2], and his account of it tallies\r\nwith that of the _Bos Gaurus_ of Hindustan, it would appear even then to\r\nhave been a rarity. A place between Neuera-ellia and Adam's Peak bears\r\nthe name of \"Gowra-ellia,\" and it is not impossible that the animal may\r\nyet be discovered in some of the imperfectly explored regions of the\r\nisland.[3] I have heard of an instance in which a very old Kandyan,\r\nresiding in the mountains near the Horton Plains, asserted that when\r\nyoung he had seen what he believed to have been a gaur, and he described\r\nit as between an elk and a buffalo in size, dark brown in colour, and\r\nvery scantily provided with hair.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Bubalus buffelus, _Gray_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: KNOX, _Historical Relation of Ceylon, &c._, A.D. 1681. Book\r\ni. c. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: KELAART, _Fauna Zeylan_., p. 87.]\r\n\r\n_Oxen_.--Oxen are used by the peasantry both in ploughing and in\r\ntempering the mud in the wet paddi fields before sowing the rice; and\r\nwhen the harvest is reaped they \"tread out the corn,\" after the\r\nimmemorial custom of the East. The wealth of the native chiefs and\r\nlanded proprietors frequently consists in their herds of bullocks, which\r\nthey hire out to their dependents during the seasons for agricultural\r\nlabour; and as they already supply them with land to be tilled, and lend\r\nthe seed which is to crop it, the further contribution of this portion\r\nof the labour serves to render the dependence of the peasantry on the\r\nchiefs and headmen complete.\r\n\r\nThe cows are often worked as well as the oxen; and as the calves are\r\nalways permitted to suck them, milk is an article which the traveller\r\ncan rarely hope to procure in a Kandyan village. From their constant\r\nexposure at all seasons, the cattle in Ceylon, both those employed in\r\nagriculture and those on the roads, are subject to devastating murrains,\r\nthat sweep them away by thousands. So frequent is the recurrence of\r\nthese calamities, and so extended their ravages, that they exercise a\r\nserious influence upon the commercial interests of the colony, by\r\nreducing the facilities of agriculture, and augmenting the cost of\r\ncarriage during the most critical periods of the coffee harvest.\r\n\r\nA similar disorder, probably peripneumonia, frequently carries off the\r\ncattle in Assam and other hill countries on the continent of India; and\r\nthere, as in Ceylon, the inflammatory symptoms in the lungs and throat,\r\nand the internal derangement and external eruptive appearances, seem to\r\nindicate that the disease is a feverish influenza, attributable to\r\nneglect and exposure in a moist and variable climate; and that its\r\nprevention might be hoped for, and the cattle preserved, by the simple\r\nexpedient of more humane and considerate treatment, especially by\r\naffording them cover at night.\r\n\r\nDuring my residence in Ceylon an incident occurred at Neuera-ellia,\r\nwhich invested one of these pretty animals with an heroic interest. A\r\nlittle cow, belonging to an English gentleman, was housed, together with\r\nher calf, near the dwelling of her owner, and being aroused during the\r\nnight by her furious bellowing, the servants, on hastening to the stall,\r\nfound her goring a leopard, which had stolen in to attack the calf. She\r\nhad got it into a corner, and whilst lowing incessantly to call for\r\nhelp, she continued to pound it with her horns. The wild animal,\r\napparently stupified by her unexpected violence, was detained by her\r\ntill despatched by a bullet.\r\n\r\nThe number of bullock-carts encountered between Colombo and Kandy, laden\r\nwith coffee from the interior, or carrying up rice and stores for the\r\nsupply of the plantations in the hill-country, is quite surprising. The\r\noxen thus employed on this single road, about seventy miles long, are\r\nestimated at upwards of twenty thousand. The bandy to which they are\r\nyoked is a barbarous two-wheeled waggon, with a covering of plaited\r\ncoco-nut leaves, in which a pair of strong bullocks will draw from five\r\nto ten hundred weight, according to the nature of the country; and with\r\nthis load on a level they will perform a journey of twenty miles a day.\r\n\r\nA few of the large humped cattle of India are annually imported for\r\ndraught; but the vast majority of those in use are small and\r\ndark-coloured, with a graceful head and neck, and elevated hump, a deep\r\nsilky dewlap, and limbs as slender as a deer. They appear to have\r\nneither the strength nor weight requisite for this service; and yet the\r\nentire coffee crop of Ceylon, amounting annually to upwards of half a\r\nmillion hundred weight, is year after year brought down from the\r\nmountains to the coast by these indefatigable little creatures, which,\r\non returning, carry up proportionally heavy loads, of rice and\r\nimplements for the estates.[1] There are two varieties of the native\r\nbullock; one a somewhat coarser animal, of a deep red colour; the other,\r\nthe high-bred black one I have just described. So rare was a white one\r\nof this species, under the native kings, that the Kandyans were\r\ncompelled to set them apart for the royal herd.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A pair of these little bullocks carry up about twenty\r\nbushels of rice to the hills, and bring down from fifty to sixty bushels\r\nof coffee to Colombo.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: WOLF says that, in the year 1763, he saw in Ceylon two\r\nwhite oxen, each of which measured upwards of eight feet high. They were\r\nsent as a present from the King of Atchin.--_Life and Adventures_, p.\r\n172.]\r\n\r\nAlthough bullocks may be said to be the only animals of draught and\r\nburden in Ceylon (horses being rarely used except in spring carriages),\r\nno attempt has been made to improve the breed, or even to better the\r\ncondition and treatment of those in use. Their food is indifferent,\r\npasture in all parts of the island being rare, and cattle are seldom\r\nhoused under any vicissitudes of weather.\r\n\r\nThe labour for which they are best adapted, and in which, before the\r\nopening of roads, these cattle were formerly employed, is in traversing\r\nthe jungle paths of the interior, carrying light loads as pack-oxen in\r\nwhat is called a \"_tavalam_\"--a term which, substituting bullocks for\r\ncamels, is equivalent to a \"caravan.\"[1] The class of persons engaged in\r\nthis traffic in Ceylon resemble in their occupations the \"Banjarees\" of\r\nHindustan, who bring down to the coast corn, cotton, and oil, and take\r\nback to the interior cloths and iron and copper utensils. In the\r\nunopened parts of the island, and especially in the eastern provinces,\r\nthis primitive practice still continues. When travelling in these\r\ndistricts I have often encountered long files of pack-bullocks toiling\r\nalong the mountain paths, their bells tinkling musically as they moved;\r\nor halting during the noonday heat beside some stream in the forests,\r\ntheir burdens piled in heaps near the drivers, who had lighted their\r\ncooking fires, whilst the bullocks were permitted to bathe and browse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Attempts have been made to domesticate the camel in Ceylon;\r\nbut, I am told, they died of ulcers in the feet, attributed to the too\r\ngreat moisture of the roads at certain seasons. This explanation seems\r\ninsufficient if taken in connection with the fact of the camel living in\r\nperfect health in climates equally, if not more, exposed to rain. I\r\napprehend that sufficient justice has not been done to the experiment.]\r\n\r\nThe persons engaged in this wandering trade are chiefly Moors, and the\r\nbusiness carried on by them consists in bringing up salt from the\r\ngovernment depots on the coast to be bartered with the Kandyans in the\r\nhills for \"native coffee,\" which is grown in small quantities round\r\nevery house, but without systematic cultivation. This they carry down to\r\nthe maritime towns, and the proceeds are invested in cotton cloths and\r\nbrass utensils, dried fish, and other commodities, with which the\r\n_tavalams_ supply the secluded villages of the interior.\r\n\r\n_The Buffalo_.--Buffaloes abound in all parts of Ceylon, but they are\r\nonly to be seen in their native wildness in the vast solitudes of the\r\nnorthern and eastern provinces, where rivers, lagoons, and dilapidated\r\ntanks abound. In these they delight to immerse themselves, till only\r\ntheir heads appear above the surface; or, enveloped in mud to protect\r\nthemselves from the assaults of insects, they luxuriate in the long\r\nsedges by the water margins. When the buffalo is browsing, a crow will\r\nfrequently be seen stationed on its back, engaged in freeing it from the\r\nticks and other pests which attach themselves to its leathery hide, the\r\nsmooth brown surface of which, unprotected by hair, shines with an\r\nunpleasant polish in the sunlight. When in motion a buffalo throws back\r\nits clumsy head till the huge horns rest on its shoulders, and the nose\r\nis presented in a line with the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe temper of the wild buffalo is morose and uncertain, and such is its\r\nstrength and courage that in the Hindu epic of the Ramayana its\r\nonslaught is compared to that of the tiger.[1] It is never quite safe to\r\napproach them, if disturbed in their pasture or alarmed from their\r\nrepose in the shallow lakes. On such occasions they hurry into line,\r\ndraw up in defensive array, with a few of the oldest bulls in advance;\r\nand, wheeling in circles, their horns clashing with a loud sound as they\r\nclank them together in their rapid evolutions, they prepare for attack;\r\nbut generally, after a menacing display the herd betake themselves to\r\nflight; then forming again at a safer distance, they halt as before,\r\nelevating their nostrils, and throwing back their heads to take a\r\ndefiant survey of the intruders. The true sportsman rarely molests them,\r\nso huge a creature affording no worthy mark for his skill, and their\r\nwanton slaughter adds nothing to the supply of food for their assailant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: CAREY and MARSHMAN'S Transl. vol. i. p. 430, 447.]\r\n\r\nIn the Hambangtotte country, where the Singhalese domesticate buffaloes,\r\nand use them to assist in the labour of the rice lands, the villagers\r\nare much annoyed by the wild ones, that mingle with the tame when sent\r\nout to the woods to pasture; and it constantly happens that a savage\r\nstranger, placing himself at the head of the tame herd, resists the\r\nattempts of the owners to drive them homewards at sunset. In the\r\ndistricts of Putlam and the Seven Corles, buffaloes are generally used\r\nfor draught; and in carrying heavy loads of salt from the coast towards\r\nthe interior, they drag a cart over roads which would defy the weaker\r\nstrength of bullocks.\r\n\r\nIn one place between Batticaloa and Trincomalie I found the natives\r\nmaking an ingenious use of them when engaged in shooting water-fowl in\r\nthe vast salt marshes and muddy lakes. Being an object to which the\r\nbirds are accustomed, the Singhalese train the buffalo to the sport,\r\nand, concealed behind, the animal browsing listlessly along, they guide\r\nit by ropes attached to its horns, and thus creep undiscovered within\r\nshot of the flock. The same practice prevails, I believe, in some of the\r\nnorthern parts of India, where they are similarly trained to assist the\r\nsportsman in approaching deer. One of these \"sporting buffaloes\" sells\r\nfor a considerable sum.\r\n\r\nIn the thick forests which cover the Passdun Corle, to the east, and\r\nsouth of Caltura, the natives use the sporting buffalo in another way,\r\nto assist in hunting deer and wild hogs. A bell is attached to its neck,\r\nand a box or basket with one side open is securely strapped on its back.\r\nThis at nightfall is lighted by flambeaux of wax, and the buffalo\r\nbearing it, is driven slowly into the jungle. The huntsmen, with their\r\nfowling pieces, keep close under the darkened side, and as it moves\r\nslowly onwards, the wild animals, startled by the sound, and bewildered\r\nby the light, steal cautiously towards it in stupified fascination. Even\r\nthe snakes, I am assured, will be attracted by this extraordinary\r\nobject; and the leopard too falls a victim to curiosity.\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiarity in the formation of the buffalo's foot, which,\r\nthough it must have attracted attention, I have never seen mentioned by\r\nnaturalists. It is equivalent to the arrangement which distinguishes the\r\nfoot of the reindeer from that of the stag and the antelope. In the\r\nlatter, the hoofs, being constructed for lightness and flight, are\r\ncompact and vertical; but, in the reindeer, the joints of the tarsal\r\nbones admit of lateral expansion, and the front hoofs curve upwards,\r\nwhile the two secondary ones behind (which are but slightly developed in\r\nthe fallow deer and others of the same family) are prolonged vertically\r\ntill, in certain positions, they are capable of being applied to the\r\nground, thus adding to the circumference and sustaining power of the\r\nfoot. It has been usually suggested as the probable design of this\r\nstructure, that it is to enable the reindeer to shovel away the snow in\r\norder to reach the lichens beneath it; but I apprehend that another use\r\nof it has been overlooked, that of facilitating its movements in search\r\nof food by increasing the difficulty of its sinking in the snow.\r\n\r\nA formation precisely analogous in the buffalo seems to point to a\r\ncorresponding design. The ox, whose life is spent on firm ground, has\r\nthe bones of the foot so constructed as to afford the most solid support\r\nto an animal of its great weight; but in the buffalo, which delights in\r\nthe morasses on the margins of pools and rivers, the construction of the\r\nfoot resembles that of the reindeer. The tarsi in front extend almost\r\nhorizontally from the upright bones of the leg, and spread apart widely\r\non touching the ground; the hoofs are flattened and broad, with the\r\nextremities turned upwards; and the false hoofs behind descend till they\r\nmake a clattering sound as the animal walks. In traversing the marshes,\r\nthis combination of abnormal incidents serves to give extraordinary\r\nbreadth to the foot, and not only prevents the buffalo from sinking\r\ninconveniently in soft ground[1], but at the same time presents no\r\nobstacle to the withdrawal of its foot from the mud.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PROFESSOR OWEN has noticed a similar fact regarding the\r\nrudiments of the second and fifth digits in the instance of the elk and\r\nbison, which have them largely expanded where they inhabit swampy\r\nground; whilst they are nearly obliterated in the camel and dromedary,\r\nthat traverse arid deserts.--OWEN _on Limbs_, p. 34; see also BELL _on\r\nthe Hand_, ch. iii.]\r\n\r\nThe buffalo, like the elk, is sometimes found in Ceylon as an albino,\r\nwith purely white hair and a pink iris.\r\n\r\n_Deer_.--\"Deer,\" says the truthful old chronicler, Robert Knox, \"are in\r\ngreat abundance in the woods, from the largeness of a cow to the\r\nsmallness of a hare, for here is a creature in this land no bigger than\r\nthe latter, though every part rightly resembleth a deer: it is called\r\n_meminna_, of a grey colour, with white spots and good meat.\"[1] The\r\nlittle creature which thus dwelt in the recollection of the old man, as\r\none of the memorials of his long captivity, is the small \"musk deer\"[2]\r\nso called in India, although neither sex is provided with a musk-bag.\r\nThe Europeans in Ceylon know it by the name of the \"moose deer;\" and in\r\nall probability the terms _musk_ and _moose_ are both corruptions of the\r\nDutch word \"_muis_,\" or \"mouse\" deer, a name particularly applicable to\r\nthe timid and crouching attitudes and aspect of this beautiful little\r\ncreature. Its extreme length never reaches two feet; and of those which\r\nwere domesticated about my house, few exceeded ten inches in height,\r\ntheir graceful limbs being of proportionate delicacy. It possesses long\r\nand extremely large tusks, with which it can inflict a severe bite. The\r\ninterpreter moodliar of Negombo had a _milk white_ meminna in 1847,\r\nwhich he designed to send home as an acceptable present to Her Majesty,\r\nbut it was unfortunately killed by an accident.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: KNOX'S _Relation, &c._, book i. c. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Moschus meminna.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: When the English look possession of Kandy, in 1803, they\r\nfound \"five beautiful milk-white deer in the palace, which was noted as\r\na very extraordinary thing.\"--_Letter_ in Appendix to PERCIVAL'S\r\n_Ceylon_, p. 428. The writer does not say of what species they were.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"MOOSE\" DEER (MOSCHUS MEMINNA)]\r\n\r\n_Ceylon Elk_.--In the mountains, the Ceylon elk[1], which reminds one of\r\nthe red deer of Scotland, attains the height of four or five feet; it\r\nabounds in all shady places that are intersected by rivers; where,\r\nthough its chase affords an endless resource to the sportsman, its\r\nvenison scarcely equals in quality the inferior beef of the lowland ox.\r\nIn the glades and park-like openings that diversify the great forests of\r\nthe interior, the spotted Axis troops in herds as numerous as the fallow\r\ndeer in England: but, in journeys through the jungle, when often\r\ndependent on the guns of our party for the precarious supply of the\r\ntable, we found the flesh of the Axis[2] and the Muntjac[3] a sorry\r\nsubstitute for that of the pea-fowl, the jungle-cock, and flamingo. The\r\noccurrence of albinos is very frequent in troops of the axis. Deer's\r\nhorns are an article of export from Ceylon, and considerable quantities\r\nare annually sent to the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Rusa Aristotelis. Dr. GRAY has lately shown that this is\r\nthe great _axis_ of Cuvier.--_Oss. Foss._ 502. t. 39; f. 10: The\r\nSinghalese, on following the elk, frequently effect their approaches by\r\nso imitating the call of the animal as to induce them to respond. An\r\ninstance occurred during my residence in Ceylon, in which two natives,\r\nwhose mimicry had mutually deceived them, crept so close together in the\r\njungle that one shot the other, supposing the cry to proceed from the\r\ngame.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Axis maculata, _H. Smith_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Stylocerus muntjac, _Horss_.]\r\n\r\nVII. PACHYDERMATA.--_The Elephant_.--The elephant, and the wild boar,\r\nthe Singhalese \"waloora,\"[1] are the only representatives of the\r\n_pachydermatous_ order. The latter, which differs somewhat from the wild\r\nboar of India, is found in droves in all parts of the island where\r\nvegetation and water are abundant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. BLYTH of Calcutta has distinguished, from the hog,\r\ncommon in India, a specimen sent to him from Ceylon, the skull of which\r\napproaches in form, that of a species from Borneo, the _susbarbatus_ of\r\nS. Müller.]\r\n\r\nThe elephant, the lord paramount of the Ceylon forests, is to be met\r\nwith in every district, on the confines of the woods, in the depths of\r\nwhich he finds concealment and shade during the hours when the sun is\r\nhigh, and from which he emerges only at twilight to wend his way towards\r\nthe rivers and tanks, where he luxuriates till dawn, when he again seeks\r\nthe retirement of the deep forests. This noble animal fills so dignified\r\na place both in the zoology and oeconomy of Ceylon, and his habits in a\r\nstate of nature have been so much misunderstood, that I shall devote a\r\nseparate section to his defence from misrepresentation, and to an\r\nexposition of what, from observation and experience, I believe to be his\r\ngenuine character when free in his native domains. But this seems the\r\nproper place to allude to a recent discovery in connexion with the\r\nelephant, which strikingly confirms a conjecture which I ventured to\r\nmake elsewhere[1], relative to the isolation of Ceylon and its\r\ndistinctness, in many remarkable particulars, from the great continent\r\nof India. Every writer who previously treated of the island, including\r\nthe accomplished Dr. Davy and the erudite Lassen, was contented, by a\r\nglance at its outline and a reference to its position on the map, to\r\nassume that Ceylon was a fragment, which in a very remote age had been\r\ntorn from the adjacent mainland, by some convulsion of nature. Hence it\r\nwas taken for granted that the vegetation which covers and the races of\r\nanimals which inhabit it, must be identical with those of Hindustan; to\r\nwhich Ceylon was alleged to bear the same relation as Sicily presents to\r\nthe peninsula of Italy. MALTE BRUN[2] and the geographers generally,\r\ndeclared the larger animals of either to be common to both. I was led to\r\nquestion the soundness of this dictum;--and from a closer examination of\r\nits geological conformation and of its botanical and zoological\r\ncharacteristics I came to the conclusion that not only is there an\r\nabsence of sameness between the formations of the two localities; but\r\nthat plants and animals, mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects exist in\r\nCeylon, which are not to be found in the flora and fauna of the Dekkan;\r\nbut which present a striking affinity, and occasionally an actual\r\nidentity, with those of the Malayan countries and some of the islands of\r\nthe Eastern Archipelago. Startling as this conclusion appeared to be, it\r\nwas strangely in unison with the legends of the Singhalese themselves,\r\nthat at an infinitely remote period Ceylon formed an integral portion of\r\na vast continent, known in the mythical epics of the Brahmans by the\r\ndesignation of \"_Lanka_;\" so immense that its southern extremity fell\r\nbelow the equator, whilst in breadth it was prolonged till its western\r\nand eastern boundaries touch at once upon the shores of Africa and\r\nChina.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ceylon, &c._, by Sir J. EMERSON TENNENT, vol. i. pp. 7,\r\n13, 85, 160, 183, n., 205, 270, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: MALTE BRUN, _Geogr. Univ._, l. xlix.]\r\n\r\nDim as is this ancient tradition, it is in consistency with the\r\nconclusions of modern geology, that at the commencement of the tertiary\r\nperiod northern Asia and a considerable part of India were in all\r\nprobability covered by the sea but that south of India land extended\r\neastward and westward connecting Malacca with Arabia. PROFESSOR ANSTED\r\nhas propounded this view. His opinion is, that the Himalayas then\r\nexisted only as a chain of islands, and did not till a much later age\r\nbecome elevated into mountain ranges,--a change which took place during\r\nthe same revolution that raised the great plains of Siberia and Tartary\r\nand many parts of north-western Europe. At the same time the great\r\ncontinent whose position between the tropics has been alluded to, and\r\nwhose previous existence is still indicated by the Coral islands, the\r\nLaccadives, the Maldives, and the Chagos group, underwent simultaneous\r\ndepression by a counteracting movement.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _The Ancient World_, by D.T. ANSTED, M.A., &c., pp.\r\n322-324.]\r\n\r\nBut divested of oriental mystery and geologic conjecture, and brought to\r\nthe test of \"geographical distribution,\" this once prodigious continent\r\nwould appear to have connected the distant Islands of Ceylon and Sumatra\r\nand possibly to have united both to the Malay peninsula, from which the\r\nlatter is now severed by the Straits of Malacca. The proofs of physical\r\naffinity between these scattered localities are exceedingly curious.\r\n\r\nA striking dissimilarity presents itself between some of the Mammalia of\r\nCeylon and those of the continent of India. In its general outline and\r\nfeature, this branch of the island fauna, no doubt, exhibits a general\r\nresemblance to that of the mainland, although many of the larger animals\r\nof the latter are unknown in Ceylon: but, on the other hand, some\r\nspecies discovered there are peculiar to the island. A deer[1] as large\r\nas the Axis, but differing from it in the number and arrangement of its\r\nspots, has been described by Dr. Kelaart, to whose vigilance the natural\r\nhistory of Ceylon is indebted, amongst others, for the identification of\r\ntwo new species of monkeys[2], a number of curious shrews[3], and an\r\norange-coloured ichneumon[4], before unknown. There are also two\r\nsquirrels[5] that have not as yet been discovered elsewhere, (one of\r\nthem belonging to those equipped with a parachute[6],) as well as some\r\nlocal varieties of the palm squirrel (Sciurus penicillatus, _Leach_).[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cervus orizus, KELAART, _Prod. F. Zeyl.,_ p. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Presbytes ursinus, _Blyth_, and P. Thersites, _Elliot_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Sorex montanus, S. ferrugineus, and Feroculus macropus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Herpestes fulvescens, KELAART, _Prod. Faun. Zeylan_..

Dr. TEMPLETON has noticed a little shrew (Corsira purpurascens,\r\n_Mag. Nat. Hist_. 1855, p. 238) at Neuera-ellia, not as yet observed\r\nelsewhere.]\r\n\r\nBut the Ceylon Mammalia, besides wanting a number of minor animals found\r\nin the Indian peninsula, cannot boast such a ruminant as the majestic\r\nGaur[1], which inhabits the great forests from Cape Comorin to the\r\nHimalaya; and, providentially, the island is equally free of the\r\nformidable tiger and the ferocious wolf of Hindustan. The Hyena and\r\nCheetah[2], common in Southern India, are unknown in Ceylon; and, though\r\nabundant in deer, the island possesses no example of the Antelope or the\r\nGazelle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Bos cavifrons, _Hodgs_.; B. frontalis, _Lamb_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Felis jubata, _Schreb_.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the Birds of Ceylon, the same abnormity is apparent. About\r\nthirty-eight species will be presently particularised[1], which,\r\nalthough some of them may hereafter be discovered to have a wider\r\ngeographical range, are at present believed to be unknown in continental\r\nIndia. I might further extend this enumeration, by including the Cheela\r\neagle of Ceylon, which, although I have placed it in my list as\r\nidentical with the _Hematornis cheela_ of the Dekkan, is, I have since\r\nbeen assured, a different bird, and is most probably the _Falco bido_ of\r\nHorsfield, known to us by specimens obtained from Java and Sumatra.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Chapter on the Birds of Ceylon.]\r\n\r\nAs to the Fishes of Ceylon, they are of course less distinct; and\r\nbesides they have hitherto been very imperfectly compared. But the\r\nInsects afford a remarkable confirmation of the view I have ventured to\r\npropound; so much so that Mr. Walker, by whom the elaborate lists\r\nappended to this work have been prepared, asserts that some of the\r\nfamilies have a less affinity to the entomology of India than to that of\r\nAustralia.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Chapter on the Insects of Ceylon.]\r\n\r\nBut more conclusive than all, is the discovery to which I have alluded,\r\nin relation to the elephant of Ceylon. Down to a very recent period it\r\nwas universally believed that only two species of the elephant are now\r\nin existence, the African and the Asiatic; distinguished by certain\r\npeculiarities in the shape of the cranium, the size of the ears, the\r\nridges of the teeth, the number of vertebræ, and, according to Cuvier,\r\nin the number of nails on the hind feet. The elephant of Ceylon was\r\nbelieved to be identical with the elephant of India. But some few years\r\nback, TEMMINCK, in his survey of the Dutch possessions in the Indian\r\nArchipelago[1], announced the fact that the elephant which abounds in\r\nSumatra (although unknown in the adjacent island of Java), and which had\r\ntheretofore been regarded as the same species with the Indian one, has\r\nbeen recently found to possess peculiarities, in which it differs as\r\nmuch from the elephant of India, as the latter from its African\r\ncongener. On this new species of elephant, to which the natives give the\r\nname of _gadjah_, TEMMINCK has conferred the scientific designation of\r\nthe _Elephas Sumatranus_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Coup d'Oeil Général sur les Possessions Néerlandaises dans\r\nl'Inde Archipélagique_.]\r\n\r\nThe points which entitle it to this distinction he enumerated minutely\r\nin the work[1] before alluded to, but they have been summarized as\r\nfollows by Prince Lucien Bonaparte.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: TEMMINCK, _Coup-d'oeil, &c_., t. i. c. iv. p. 328.; t. ii.\r\nc. iii. p. 91.]\r\n\r\n\"This species is perfectly intermediate between the Indian and African,\r\nespecially in the shape of the skull, and will certainly put an end to\r\nthe distinction between _Elephas_ and _Loxodon_, with those who admit\r\nthat anatomical genus; since although the crowns of the teeth of _E.\r\nSumatranus_ are more like the Asiatic animal, still the less numerous\r\nundulated ribbons of enamel are nearly quite as wide as those forming\r\nthe lozenges of the African. The number of pairs of false ribs (which\r\nalone vary, the true ones being always six) is fourteen, one less than\r\nin the _Africanus_, _one_ more than in the _Indicus_; and so it is with\r\nthe dorsal vertebræ, which are twenty in the _Sumatranus_ (_twenty-one_\r\nand _nineteen_, in the others), whilst the new species agrees with\r\n_Africanus_ in the number of sacral vertebræ (_four_), and with\r\n_Indicus_ in that of the caudal ones, which are _thirty-four_.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Proceed. Zool. Soc. London_, 1849. p. 144, _note_. The\r\noriginal description of TEMMINCK is as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Elephas Sumatranus, _Nob_. ressemble, par la forme générale du crâne à\r\nl'éléphant du continent de l'Asie; mais la partie libre des\r\nintermaxillaires est beaucoup plus courte et plus étroite; les cavités\r\nnasales sont beaucoup moins larges; l'espace entre les orbites des yeux\r\nest plus étroit; la partie postérieur du crâne au contraire est plus\r\nlarge que dans l'espèce du continent.\r\n\r\n\"Les machelières se rapprochent, par la forme de leur couronne, plutòt\r\nde l'espèce Asíatique que do celle qui est propre à l'Afrique;\r\nc'est-à-dire que leur couronne offre la forme de rubans ondoyés et non\r\npas en losange; mais ces rubans sont de la largeur de ceux qu'on voit à\r\nla couronne des dents de l'éléphant d'Afrique; ils sont conséquemment\r\nmoins nombreux que dans celuí du continent de l'Asie. Les dimensions de\r\nces rubans, dans la direction d'avant en arrière, comparées à celle\r\nprises dans la direction transversale et latérale, sont en raison de 3\r\nou 4 à 1; tandis que dans l'éléphant du continent elles sont comme 4 ou\r\n6 à 1. La longueur totale de six de ces rubans, dans l'espèce nouvelle\r\nde Sumatra, ainsi que dans celle d'Afrique, est d'environ 12\r\ncentimètres, tandis que cette longueur n'est que de 8 à 10 centimètres\r\ndans l'espèce du continent de l'Asie.\r\n\r\n\"Les autres formes ostéologiques sont à peu près les mêmes dans les\r\ntrois espèces; mais il y a différence dans le nombre des os dont le\r\nsquelette se compose, ainsi que le tableau comparatif ci-joint\r\nl'éprouve.\r\n\r\n\"_L'elephas Africanus_ a 7 vertèbres du cou, 21 vert. dorsales, 3\r\nlombaires, 4 sacrées, et 26 caudales; 21 paires de côtes, dont 6 vraies,\r\net 15 fausses. _L'elephas Indicus_ a 7 vertèbres du cou, 19 dorsales, 3\r\nlombaires, 5 sacrées, et 34 caudales, 19 paires de côtes, dont 6 vraies,\r\net 3 fausses. _L'elephas Sumatranus_ a 7 vertèbres du cou, 20 dorsales,\r\n3 lombaires, 4 sacrées, et 34 caudales; 20 paires du côtes, dont 6\r\nvraies, et 14 fausses.\r\n\r\n\"Ces caractères ont été constatés sur trois squelettes de l'espèce\r\nnouvelle, un mâle et une femelle adultes et un jeune mâle. Nous n'avons\r\npas encore été à même de nous procurer la dépouille de cette espèce.\"]\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR SCHLEGEL of Leyden, in a paper lately submitted by him to the\r\nRoyal Academy of Sciences of Holland, (the substance of which he has\r\nobligingly communicated to me, through Baron Bentinck the Netherlands\r\nMinister at this Court), has confirmed the identity of the Ceylon\r\nelephant with that found in the Lampongs of Sumatra. The osteological\r\ncomparison of which TEMMINCK has given the results was, he says,\r\nconducted by himself with access to four skeletons of the latter. And\r\nthe more recent opportunity of comparing a living Sumatran elephant with\r\none from Bengal, has served to establish other though minor points of\r\ndivergence. The Indian species is more robust and powerful: the\r\nproboscis longer and more slender; and the extremity, (a point, in which\r\nthe elephant of Sumatra resembles that of Africa,) is more flattened and\r\nprovided with coarser and longer hair than that of India.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR SCHLEGEL, adverting to the large export of elephants from\r\nCeylon to the Indian continent, which has been carried on from time\r\nimmemorial, suggests the caution with which naturalists, in\r\ninvestigating this question, should first satisfy themselves whether the\r\nelephants they examine are really natives of the mainland,  or whether\r\nthey have been brought to it from the islands.[1] \"The extraordinary\r\nfact,\" he observes in his letter to me, \"of the identity thus\r\nestablished between the elephants of Ceylon and Sumatra; and the points\r\nin which they are found to differ from that of Bengal, leads to the\r\nquestion whether all the elephants of the Asiatic continent belong to\r\none single species; or whether these vast regions may not produce in\r\nsome quarter as yet unexplored the one hitherto found only in the two\r\nislands referred to? It is highly desirable that naturalists who have\r\nthe means and opportunity, should exert themselves to discover, whether\r\nany traces are to be found of the Ceylon elephant in the Dekkan; or of\r\nthat of Sumatra in Cochin China or Siam.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A further inquiry suggests itself, how far the intermixture\r\nof the breed may have served to confound specific differences, in the\r\ncase of elephants bred on the continent of India, from stock partially\r\nimported from Ceylon?]\r\n\r\nTo me the establishment of a fact so conclusively confirmatory of the\r\ntheory I had ventured to broach, is productive of great satisfaction.\r\nBut it is not a little remarkable that the distinction should not long\r\nbefore have been discovered between the elephant of India and that of\r\nCeylon. Nor can it be regarded otherwise than as a singular illustration\r\nof \"geographical distribution\" that two remote islands should be thus\r\nshown to possess in common a species unknown in any other quarter of the\r\nglobe. As bearing on the ancient myth which represents both countries as\r\nforming parts of a submerged continent, the discovery is curious--and it\r\nis equally interesting in connection with the circumstance alluded to by\r\nGibbon, that amongst the early geographers and even down to a\r\ncomparatively modern date, Sumatra and Ceylon were confounded; and grave\r\ndoubts were entertained as to which of the two was the \"Taprobane\" of\r\nantiquity. GEMMA FRISIUS, SEBASTIAN MUNSTER, JULIUS SCALIGER, ORTELIUS\r\nand MERCATOR contended for the former; SALMASIUS, BOCHART, CLUVERIUS,\r\nand VOSSIUS for Ceylon: and the controversy did not cease till it was\r\nterminated by DELISLE about the beginning of the last century.\r\n\r\nVIII. CETACEA.--Whales are so frequently seen that they have been\r\ncaptured within sight of Colombo, and more than once their carcases,\r\nafter having been flinched by the whalers, have floated on shore near\r\nthe lighthouse, tainting the atmosphere within the fort by their rapid\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\nOf this family, one of the most remarkable animals on the coast is the\r\ndugong[1], a phytophagous cetacean, numbers of which are attracted to\r\nthe inlets, from the bay of Calpentyn to Adam's Bridge, by the still\r\nwater and the abundance of marine algæ in these parts of the gulf. One\r\nwhich was killed at Manaar and sent to me to Colombo[2] in 1847,\r\nmeasured upwards of seven feet in length; but specimens considerably\r\nlarger have been taken at Calpentyn, and their flesh is represented as\r\nclosely resembling veal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Halicore dugung_, F. Cuv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The skeleton is now in the Museum of the Natural History\r\nSociety of Belfast.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DUGONG.]\r\n\r\nThe rude approach to the human outline, observed in the shape of the\r\nhead of this creature, and the attitude of the mother when suckling her\r\nyoung, clasping it to her breast with one flipper, while swimming with\r\nthe other, holding the heads of both above water; and when disturbed,\r\nsuddenly diving and displaying her fish-like tail,--these, together with\r\nher habitual demonstrations of strong maternal affection, probably gave\r\nrise to the fable of the \"mermaid;\" and thus that earliest invention of\r\nmythical physiology may be traced to the Arab seamen and the Greeks, who\r\nhad watched the movements of the dugong in the waters of Manaar.\r\n\r\nMegasthenes records the existence of a creature in the ocean, near\r\nTaprobane, with the aspect of a woman[1]; and Ælian, adopting and\r\nenlarging on his information, peoples the seas of Ceylon with fishes\r\nhaving the heads of lions, panthers, and rams, and, stranger still,\r\n_cetaceans in the form of satyrs_. Statements such as these must have\r\nhad their origin in the hairs, which are set round the mouth of the\r\ndugong, somewhat resembling a beard, which Ælian and Megasthenes both\r\nparticularise, from their resemblance to the hair of a woman: \"[Greek:\r\nkai gynaikôn opsin echousin aisper anti plokamôn akanthai\r\nprosêrtêntai\"][2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: MEGASTHENES, _Indica_, fragm. lix. 34,]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: ÆLIAN, _Nat. Hist._, lib. xvi. ch. xviii.]\r\n\r\nThe Portuguese cherished the belief in the mermaid, and the annalist of\r\nthe exploits of the Jesuits in India, gravely records that seven of\r\nthese monsters, male and female, were captured at Manaar in 1560, and\r\ncarried to Goa, where they were dissected by Demas Bosquez, physician to\r\nthe Viceroy, and \"their internal structure found to be in all respects\r\nconformable to the human.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Hist, de la Compagnie de Jésus_, quoted in the _Asiat.\r\nJourn._ vol. xiv. p. 461; and in FORBES' _Orient. Memoirs_, vol. i. p.\r\n421.]\r\n\r\nThe Dutch were no less inclined to the marvellous, and they propagated\r\nthe belief in the mermaid with earnestness and particularity. VALENTYN,\r\none of their chaplains, in his account of the Natural History of\r\nAmboina, embodied in his great work on the Netherlands' Possessions in\r\nIndia, published so late as 1727[1], has devoted the first section of\r\nhis chapter on the Fishes of that island to a minute description of the\r\n\"Zee-Menschen, Zee-Wyven,\" and mermaids. As to the dugong he admits its\r\nresemblance to the mermaid, but repudiates the idea of its having given\r\nrise to the fable, by being mistaken for one. This error he imagines\r\nmust have arisen at a time when observations on such matters were made\r\nwith culpable laxity; but now more recent and minute attention has\r\nestablished the truth beyond cavil.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: FRAN. VALENTYN, _Beschryving van Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien_,\r\n&c. 5 vol. fol. Dordrecht and Amsterdam, MDCCXXVII. vol. iii. p. 330.]\r\n\r\nFor instance, he states that in 1653, when a lieutenant in the Dutch\r\nservice was leading a party of soldiers along the sea-shore in Amboina,\r\nhe and all his company saw the mermen swimming at a short distance from\r\nthe beach with long and flowing hair, of a colour between gray and\r\ngreen--and six weeks afterwards, the creatures were again seen by him\r\nand more than fifty witnesses, at the same place, by clear daylight.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: VALENTYN, _Beschryving, &c._, vol. iii. p. 331.]\r\n\r\n\"If any narrative in the world,\" adds VALENTYN, \"deserves credit, it is\r\nthis; since _not only one but two mermen_ together were seen by so many\r\neye-witnesses. Should the stubborn world, however, hesitate to believe\r\nit, it matters nothing; as there are people who would even deny that\r\nsuch cities as Rome, Constantinople or Cairo, exist, merely because they\r\nthemselves have not happened to see them.\"\r\n\r\nBut what are such incredulous persons, he continues, to make of the\r\ncircumstance recorded by Albert Herport in his account of India[1], that\r\na sea-man was seen in the water near the Church of Taquan, on the\r\nmorning of the 29th of April 1661, and a mermaid at the same spot the\r\nsame afternoon?--or what do they say to the fact that in 1714, a mermaid\r\nwas not only seen but captured near the island of Booro? \"five feet\r\nRhineland measure in height, which lived four days and seven hours, but\r\nrefusing all food, died without leaving any intelligible account of\r\nherself.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Probably the _Itinerarium Indicum_ of ALBRECHT HERPORT.\r\nBerne, 1669.]\r\n\r\nValentyn, in support of his own faith in the mermaid, cites numerous\r\nother instances in which both \"sea-men and women\" were seen and taken at\r\nAmboina; especially one by an office-bearer in the Church of Holland[1],\r\nby whom it was surrendered to the Governor Vanderstel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A \"krank-bezoeker\" or visitant of the sick.]\r\n\r\nOf this well-authenticated specimen he gives an elaborate engraving\r\namongst those of the authentic fishes of the island--together with a\r\nminute ichthyological description of each for the satisfaction of men of\r\nscience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MERMAID (From VALENTYN)]\r\n\r\nThe fame of this creature having reached Europe, the British Minister in\r\nHolland wrote to Valentyn on the 28th December 1716, whilst the Emperor,\r\nPeter the Great of Russia, was his guest at Amsterdam; to communicate\r\nthe desire of the Czar, that the mermaid should be brought home from\r\nAmboina for his Imperial inspection.\r\n\r\nTo complete his proofs of the existence of mermen and women, Valentyn\r\npoints triumphantly to the historical fact, that in Holland in the year\r\n1404, a mermaid was driven during a tempest, through a breach in the\r\ndyke of Edam, and was taken alive in the lake of Purmer. Thence she was\r\ncarried to Harlem, where the Dutch women taught her to spin; and where,\r\nseveral years after, she died in the Roman Catholic faith;--\"but this,\"\r\nsays the pious Calvinistic chaplain, \"in no way militates against the\r\ntruth of her story.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: VALENTYN, _Beschryving, &c_., p. 333.]\r\n\r\nFinally Valentyn winds up his proofs, by the accumulated testimony of\r\nPliny [1], Theodore Gaza, George of Trebisond, and Alexander ab\r\nAlexandro, to show that mermaids had in all ages been known in Gaul,\r\nNaples, Epirus, and the Morea. From these and a multitude of more modern\r\ninstances he comes to the conclusion, that as there are \"sea-cows,\"\r\n\"sea-horses,\" and \"sea-dogs;\" as well as \"sea-trees\" and \"sea-flowers\"\r\nwhich he himself had seen, what grounds in reason are there to doubt\r\nthat there may also be \"sea-maidens\" and \"sea-men!\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Nat. Hist_. l. ix. c. 5, where Pliny speaks of the\r\nNereids.]\r\n\r\n_List of Ceylon Mammalia._\r\n\r\nA list of the Mammalia of Ceylon is subjoined. In framing it, as well as\r\nthe lists appended to the other chapters on the Fauna of the island, the\r\nprincipal object in view has been to exhibit the extent to which the\r\nNatural History of the island had been investigated, and collections\r\nmade up to the period of my leaving the colony in 1850. It has been\r\nconsidered expedient to exclude a few individuals which have not had the\r\nadvantage of a direct comparison with authentic specimens, either at\r\nCalcutta or in England. This will account for the omission of a number\r\nthat have appeared in other catalogues, but of which many, though\r\nascertained to exist, have not been submitted to this rigorous process\r\nof identification.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of the species of mammals and birds contained in\r\nthese lists will be found, with suitable references to the most accurate\r\ndescriptions, in the admirable catalogue of the collection at the India\r\nHouse, published under the care of the late Dr. Horsfield. This work\r\ncannot be too highly extolled, not alone for the scrupulous fidelity\r\nwith which the description of each species is referred to its first\r\ndiscoverer, but also for the pains which have been taken to elaborate\r\nsynonymes and to collate from local periodicals and other sources,\r\n(little accessible to ordinary inquirers,) such incidents and traits as\r\nare calculated to illustrate characteristics and habits.\r\n\r\nQUADRUMANA.\r\n\r\nPresbytes\r\n  cephalopterus, _Zimm_.\r\n  ursinus, _Blyth_.\r\n  Priamus, _Elliot & Blyth_.\r\n  Thersites, _Blyth_.\r\nMacacus pileatus, _Shaw & Desm_.\r\nLoris gracilis, _Geoff_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEIROPTERA.\r\n\r\nPteropus Edwardsii, _Geoff_.\r\n  Leschenaultii, _Dum_.\r\nCynopterus\r\n  marginatus, _Ham_.\r\nMegaderma spasma, _Linn._\r\n  lyra, _Geoff_.\r\nRhinolophus _affinis_, _Horsf_.\r\nHipposideros\r\n  murinus, _Elliot_.\r\n  speoris, _Elliot_.\r\n  armiger, _Hodgs_.\r\n  vulgaris, _Horsf_.\r\nKerivoula picta, _Pall_.\r\nTaphozous\r\n  longimanus, _Har_.\r\nScotophilus Coromandelicus, _F.

II.\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Structure and Functions._\r\n\r\nDuring my residence at Kandy, I had twice the opportunity of witnessing\r\nthe operation on a grand scale, of capturing wild elephants, intended to\r\nbe trained for the public service in the establishment of the Civil\r\nEngineer;--and in the course of my frequent journeys through the\r\ninterior of the island, I succeeded in collecting so many facts relative\r\nto the habits of these interesting animals in a state of nature, as\r\nenable me not only to add to the information previously possessed, but\r\nto correct many fallacies popularly received regarding their instincts\r\nand disposition. These particulars I am anxious to place on record\r\nbefore proceeding to describe the scenes of which I was a spectator,\r\nduring the progress of the elephant hunts in the district of the Seven\r\nKorles, at which I was present in 1846, and again in 1847.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the narrow but densely inhabited belt of\r\ncultivated land, that extends along the seaborde of the island from\r\nChilaw on the western coast to Tangalle on the south-east, there is no\r\npart of Ceylon in which elephants may not be said to abound; even close\r\nto the environs of the most populous localities of the interior. They\r\nfrequent both the open plains and the deep forests; and their footsteps\r\nare to be seen wherever food and shade, vegetation and water[1], allure\r\nthem, alike on the summits of the loftiest mountains, and on the borders\r\nof the tanks and lowland streams.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: M. AD. PICTET has availed himself of the love of the\r\nelephant for water, to found on it a solution of the long-contested\r\nquestion as to the etymology of the word \"elephant,\"-a term which,\r\nwhilst it has passed into almost every dialect of the West, is scarcely\r\nto be traced in any language of Asia. The Greek [Greek: elephas], to\r\nwhich we are immediately indebted for it, did not originally mean the\r\nanimal, but, as early as the time of Homer, was applied only to its\r\ntusks, and signified _ivory_. BOCHART has sought for a Semitic origin,\r\nand seizing on the Arabic _fil_, and prefixing the article _al_,\r\nsuggests _alfil_, akin to [Greek: eleph]; but rejecting this, BOCHART\r\nhimself resorts to the Hebrew _eleph_, an \"ox\"--and this conjecture\r\nderives a certain degree of countenance from the fact that the Romans,\r\nwhen they obtained their first sight of the elephant in the army of\r\nPyrrhus, in Lucania, called it the _Luca bos_. But the [Greek: antos] is\r\nstill unaccounted for; and POTT has sought to remove the difficulty by\r\nintroducing the Arabic _hindi_, Indian, s thus making _eleph-hindi_,\r\n\"_bos Indicus_.\" The conversion of _hindi_ into [Greek: antos] is an\r\nobstacle, but here the example of \"tamarind\" comes to aid; _tamar\r\nhindi_, the \"Indian date,\" which in mediæval Greek forms [Greek:\r\ntamarenti]. A theory of Benary, that helhephas might be compounded of\r\nthe Arabic _al_, and _ibha_, a Sanskrit name for the elephant, is\r\nexposed to still greater etymological exception. PICTET'S solution is,\r\nthat in the Sanskrit epics \"the King of Elephants,\" who has the\r\ndistinction of carrying the god Indra, is called _airarata_ or\r\n_airavana_, a modification of _airavanta_, \"son of the ocean,\" which\r\nagain comes from _iravat_, \"abounding in water.\" \"Nous aurions done\r\nainsi, comme corrélatif du gree [Greek: elephanto], une ancienne forme,\r\n_âirâvanta_ ou _âilâvanta_, affaiblie plus tard en _âirâvata_ ou\r\n_âirâvana_.... On connaît la prédilection de l'éléphant pour le\r\nvoisinage des fleuves, et son amour pour l'eau, dont l'abondance est\r\nnécessaire à son bien-être.\" This Sanskrit name, PICTET supposes, may\r\nhave been carried to the West by the Phoenicians, who were the purveyors\r\nof ivory from India; and, from the Greek, the Latins derived _elephas_,\r\nwhich passed into the modern languages of Italy, Germany, and France.\r\nBut it is curious that the Spaniards acquired from the Moors their\r\nArabic term for ivory, _marfil_, and the Portuguese _marfim_; and that\r\nthe Scandinavians, probably from their early expeditions to the\r\nMediterranean, adopted _fill_ as their name for the elephant itself, and\r\n_fil-bein_ for ivory; in Danish, _fils-ben_. (See _Journ. Asiat._ 1843,\r\nt. xliii. p. 133.) The Spaniards of South America call the palm which\r\nproduces the vegetable ivory (_Phytelephas macrocarpa_) _Palma de\r\nmarfil_, and the nut itself, _marfil vegetal_.\r\n\r\nSince the above was written Gooneratné Modliar, the Singhalese\r\nInterpreter to the Supreme Court at Colombo, has supplied me with\r\nanother conjecture, that the word elephant may possibly be traced to the\r\nSinghalese name of the animal, _alia_, which means literally, \"the huge\r\none.\" _Alia_, he adds, is not a derivation from Sanskrit or Pali, but\r\nbelongs to a dialect more ancient than either.]\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial the natives have been taught to capture and tame\r\nthem and the export of elephants from Ceylon to India has been going on\r\nwithout interruption from the period of the first Punic War.[1] In later\r\ntimes all elephants were the property of the Kandyan crown; and their\r\ncapture or slaughter without the royal permission was classed amongst\r\nthe gravest offences in the criminal code.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ÆLIAN, _de Nat. Anim._ lib. xvi. c. 18; COSMAS INDICOPL.,\r\np. 128.]\r\n\r\nIn recent years there is reason to believe that their numbers have\r\nbecome considerably reduced. They have entirely disappeared from\r\nlocalities in which they were formerly numerous[1]; smaller herds have\r\nbeen taken in the periodical captures for the government service, and\r\nhunters returning from the chase report them to be growing scarce. In\r\nconsequence of this diminution the peasantry in some parts of the island\r\nhave even suspended the ancient practice of keeping watchers and fires\r\nby night to drive away the elephants from their growing crops.[2] The\r\nopening of roads and the clearing of the mountain forests of Kandy for\r\nthe cultivation of coffee, have forced the animals to retire to the low\r\ncountry, where again they have been followed by large parties of\r\nEuropean sportsmen; and the Singhalese themselves, being more freely\r\nprovided with arms than in former times, have assisted in swelling the\r\nannual slaughter.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: LE BRUN, who visited Ceylon A.D. 1705, says that in the\r\ndistrict round Colombo, where elephants are now never seen, they were\r\nthen so abundant, that 160 had been taken in a single corral. (_Voyage_,\r\n&c., tom. ii. ch. lxiii. p. 331.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In some parts of Bengal, where elephants were formerly\r\ntroublesome (especially near the wilds of Ramgur), the natives got rid\r\nof them by mixing a preparation of the poisonous Nepal root called\r\n_dakra_ in balls of grain, and other materials, of which the animal is\r\nfond. In Cuttack, above fifty years ago, mineral poison was laid for\r\nthem in the same way, and the carcases of eighty were found which had\r\nbeen killed by it. (_Asiat. Res._, xv. 183.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The number of elephants has been similarly reduced\r\nthroughout the south of India.]\r\n\r\nHad the motive that incites to the destruction of the elephant in Africa\r\nand India prevailed in Ceylon, that is, had the elephants there been\r\nprovided with tusks, they would long since have been annihilated for the\r\nsake of their ivory.[1] But it is a curious fact that, whilst in Africa\r\nand India both sexes have tusks[2], with some slight disproportion in\r\nthe size of those of the females: not one elephant in a hundred is found\r\nwith tusks in Ceylon, and the few that possess them are exclusively\r\nmales. Nearly all, however, have those stunted processes called\r\n_tushes_, about ten or twelve inches in length and one or two in\r\ndiameter. These I have observed them to use in loosening earth,\r\nstripping off bark, and snapping asunder small branches and climbing\r\nplants; and hence tushes are seldom seen without a groove worn into them\r\nnear their extremities.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The annual importation of ivory into Great Britain alone,\r\nfor the last few years, has been about _one million_ pounds; which,\r\ntaking the average weight of a tusk at sixty pounds, would require the\r\nslaughter of 8,333 male elephants.\r\n\r\nBut of this quantity the importation from Ceylon has generally averaged\r\nonly five or six hundred weight; which, making allowance for the\r\nlightness of the tusks, would not involve the destruction of more than\r\nseven or eight in each year. At the same time, this does not fairly\r\nrepresent the annual number of tuskers shot in Ceylon, not only because\r\na portion of the ivory finds its way to China and to other places, but\r\nbecause the chiefs and Buddhist priests have a passion for collecting\r\ntusks, and the finest and largest are to be found ornamenting their\r\ntemples and private dwellings. The Chinese profess that for their\r\nexquisite carvings the ivory of Ceylon excels all other, both in density\r\nof texture and in delicacy of tint; but in the European market, the\r\nivory of Africa, from its more distinct graining and other causes,\r\nobtains a higher price.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A writer in the _India Sporting Review_ for October 1857\r\nsays, \"In Malabar a tuskless male elephant is rare; I have seen but\r\ntwo.\"--p. 157.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The old fallacy is still renewed, that the elephant sheds\r\nhis tusks. ÆLIAN says he drops them once in ten years (lib. xiv. c. 5):\r\nand PLINY repeats the story, adding that, when dropped, the elephants\r\nhide them under ground (lib. viii.) whence SHAW says, in his _Zoology_,\r\n\"they are frequently found in the woods,\" and exported from Africa (vol.\r\ni. p. 213): and Sir W. JARDINE in the _Naturalist's Library_ (vol. ix.\r\np. 110), says, \"the tusks are shed about the twelfth or thirteenth\r\nyear.\" This is erroneous: after losing the first pair, or, as they are\r\ncalled, the \"milk tusks,\" which drop in consequence of the absorption of\r\ntheir roots, when the animal is extremely young, the second pair acquire\r\ntheir full size, and become the \"permanent tusks,\" which are never\r\nshed.]\r\n\r\nAmongst other surmises more ingenious than sound, the general absence of\r\ntusks in the elephant of Ceylon has been associated with the profusion\r\nof rivers and streams in the island; whilst it has been thrown out as a\r\npossibility that in Africa, where water is comparatively scarce, the\r\nanimal is equipped with these implements in order to assist it in\r\ndigging wells in the sand and in raising the juicy roots of the mimosas\r\nand succulent plants for the sake of their moisture. In support of this\r\nhypothesis, it has been observed, that whilst the tusks of the Ceylon\r\nspecies, which are never required for such uses, are slender, graceful\r\nand curved, seldom exceeding fifty or sixty pounds' weight, those of the\r\nAfrican elephant are straight and thick, weighing occasionally one\r\nhundred and fifty, and even three hundred pounds.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Notwithstanding the inferiority in weight of the Ceylon\r\ntusks, as compared with those of the elephant of India, it would, I\r\nthink, be precipitate to draw the inference that the size of the former\r\nwas uniformly and naturally less than that of the latter. The truth, I\r\nbelieve to be, that if permitted to grow to maturity, the tusks of the\r\none would, in all probability, equal those of the other; but, so eager\r\nis the search for ivory in Ceylon, that a tusker, when once observed in\r\na herd, is followed up with such vigilant impatience, that he is almost\r\ninvariably shot before attaining his full growth. General DE LIMA, when\r\nreturning from the governorship of the Portuguese settlements at\r\nMozambique, told me, in 1848, that he had been requested to procure two\r\ntusks of the largest size, and straightest possible shape, which were to\r\nbe formed into a cross to surmount the high altar of the cathedral at\r\nGoa: he succeeded in his commission, and sent two, one of which was 180\r\npounds, and the other 170 pounds' weight, with the slightest possible\r\ncurve. In a periodical, entitled _The Friend_, published in Ceylon, it\r\nis stated in the volume for 1837 that the officers belonging to the\r\nships Quorrah and Alburhak, engaged in the Niger Expedition, were shown\r\nby a native king two tusks, each two feet and a half in circumference at\r\nthe base, eight feet long, and weighing upwards of 200 pounds. (Vol. i.\r\np. 225.) BRODERIP, in his _Zoological Recreations_, p. 255, says a tusk\r\nof 350 pounds' weight was sold at Amsterdam, but he does not quote his\r\nauthority.]\r\n\r\nBut it is manifestly inconsistent with the idea that tusks were given to\r\nthe elephant to assist him in digging for his food, to find that the\r\nfemales are less bountifully supplied with them than the males, whilst\r\nthe necessity for their use extends equally to both sexes. The same\r\nargument serves to demonstrate the fallacy of the conjecture, that the\r\ntusks of the elephant were given to him as weapons of offence, for if\r\nsuch were the case the vast majority in Ceylon, males as well as\r\nfemales, would be left helpless in presence of an assailant. But\r\nalthough in their conflicts with one another, those which are provided\r\nwith tusks may occasionally push with them clumsily at their opponents;\r\nit is a misapprehension to imagine that tusks are designed specially to\r\nserve \"in warding off the attacks of the wily tiger and the furious\r\nrhinoceros, often securing the victory by one blow which transfixes the\r\nassailant to the earth.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Menageries, &c._, published by the Society for the\r\nDiffusion of Useful Knowledge, vol. i. p. 68: \"The Elephant,\" ch. iii.\r\nIt will be seen that I have quoted repeatedly from this volume, because\r\nit is the most compendious and careful compilation with which I am\r\nacquainted of the information previously existing regarding the\r\nelephant. The author incorporates no speculations of his own, but has\r\nmost diligently and agreeably arranged all the facts collected by his\r\npredecessors. The story of antipathy between the elephant and rhinoceros\r\nis probably borrowed from ÆLIAN _de Nat._, lib. xvii. c. 44.]\r\n\r\nSo harmless and peaceful is the life of the elephant, that nature\r\nappears to have left it unprovided with any weapon of offence: its trunk\r\nis too delicate an organ to be rudely employed in a conflict with other\r\nanimals, and although on an emergency it may push or gore with its tusks\r\n(to which the French have hastily given the term \"_défenses_\"), their\r\nalmost vertical position, added to the difficulty of raising its head\r\nabove the level of the shoulder, is inconsistent with the idea of their\r\nbeing designed for attack, since it is impossible for the elephant to\r\nstrike an effectual blow, or to \"wield\" its tusks as the deer and the\r\nbuffalo can direct their horns. Nor is it easy to conceive under what\r\ncircumstances an elephant could have a hostile encounter with either a\r\nrhinoceros or a tiger, with whose pursuits in a state of nature its own\r\ncan in no way conflict.\r\n\r\nTowards man elephants evince shyness, arising from their love of\r\nsolitude and dislike of intrusion; any alarm they exhibit at his\r\nappearance may be reasonably traced to the slaughter which has reduced\r\ntheir numbers; and as some evidence of this, it has always been observed\r\nthat an elephant exhibits greater impatience of the presence of a white\r\nman than of a native. Were its instincts to carry it further, or were it\r\ninfluenced by any feeling of animosity or cruelty, it must be apparent\r\nthat, as against the prodigious numbers that inhabit the forests of\r\nCeylon, man would wage an unequal contest, and that of the two one or\r\nother must long since have been reduced to a helpless minority.\r\n\r\nOfficial testimony is not wanting in confirmation of this view;--in the\r\nreturns of 108 coroners' inquests in Ceylon, during five years, from\r\n1849 to 1855 inclusive, held in cases of death occasioned by wild\r\nanimals; 16 are recorded as having been caused by elephants, 15 by\r\nbuffaloes, 6 by crocodiles, 2 by boars, 1 by a bear, and 68 by serpents\r\n(the great majority of the last class of sufferers being women and\r\nchildren, who had been bitten during the night). Little more than\r\n_three_ fatal accidents occurring annually on the average of five years,\r\nis certainly a very small proportion in a population estimated at a\r\nmillion and a half, in an island abounding with elephants, with which,\r\nindependently of casual encounters, voluntary conflicts are daily\r\nstimulated by the love of sport or the hope of gain. Were the elephants\r\ninstinctively vicious or even highly irritable in their temperament, the\r\ndestruction of human life under the circumstances must have been\r\ninfinitely greater. It must also be taken into account, that some of the\r\naccidents recorded may have occurred in the rutting season, when\r\nelephants are subject to fits of temporary fury, known in India by the\r\nterm _must_, in Ceylon _mudda_,--a paroxysm which speedily passes away,\r\nbut during the fury of which it is dangerous even for the mahout to\r\napproach those ordinarily the gentlest and most familiar.\r\n\r\nBut, then, the elephant is said to \"entertain an extraordinary dislike\r\nto all quadrupeds; that dogs running near him produce annoyance; that he\r\nis alarmed if a hare start from her form;\" and from Pliny to Buffon\r\nevery naturalist has recorded its supposed aversion to swine.[1] These\r\nalleged antipathies are in a great degree, if not entirely, imaginary.\r\nThe habits of the elephant are essentially harmless, its wants lead to\r\nno rivalry with other animals, and the food to which it is most attached\r\nflourishes in such abundance that it is obtained without an effort. In\r\nthe quiet solitudes of Ceylon, elephants may constantly be seen browsing\r\npeacefully in the immediate vicinity of other animals, and in close\r\ncontact with them. I have seen groups of deer and wild buffaloes\r\nreclining in the sandy bed of a river in the dry season, and elephants\r\nplucking the branches close beside them. They show no impatience in the\r\ncompany of the elk, the bear, and the wild hog; and on the other hand, I\r\nhave never discovered an instance in which these animals have evinced\r\nany apprehension of elephants. The elephant's natural timidity, however,\r\nis such that it becomes alarmed on the appearance in the jungle of any\r\nanimal with which it is not familiar. It is said to be afraid of the\r\nhorse; but from my own experience, I should say it is the horse that is\r\nalarmed at the aspect of the elephant. In the same way, from some\r\nunaccountable impulse, the horse has an antipathy to the camel, and\r\nevinces extreme impatience, both of the sight and the smell of that\r\nanimal.[2] When enraged, an elephant will not hesitate to charge a rider\r\non horseback; but it is against the man, not against the horse, that his\r\nfury is directed; and no instance has been ever known of his wantonly\r\nassailing a horse. A horse, belonging to the late Major Rogers[3], had\r\nrun away from his groom, and was found some considerable time afterwards\r\ngrazing quietly with a herd of elephants. In DE BRY'S splendid\r\ncollection of travels, however, there is included \"_The voyage of a\r\nCertain Englishman to Cambay_;\" in which the author asserts that at\r\nAgra, in the year 1607, he was present at a spectacle given by the\r\nViceregent of the great Mogul, in the course of which he saw an elephant\r\ndestroy two horses, by seizing them in its trunk, and crushing them\r\nunder foot.[4] But the display was avowedly an artificial one, and the\r\ncreature must have been cruelly tutored for the occasion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Menageries, &c._, \"The Elephant,\" ch. iii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This peculiarity was noticed by the ancients, and is\r\nrecorded by Herodotus: [Greek: \"kamêlon hippos phobeetai, kai ouk\r\nanechetai oute tên ideên autês oreôn oute tên odmên osphrainomenos\"]\r\n(Herod. ch. 80). Camels have long been bred by the Grand Duke of\r\nTuscany, at his establishment near Pisa, and even there the same\r\ninstinctive dislike to them is manifested by the horse, which it is\r\nnecessary to train and accustom to their presence in order to avoid\r\naccidents. Mr. BRODERIP mentions, that, \"when the precaution of such\r\ntraining has not been adopted, the sudden and dangerous terror with\r\nwhich a horse is seized in coming unexpectedly upon one of them is\r\nexcessive.\"--_Note-book of a Naturalist_, ch. iv. p. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Major ROGERS was many years the chief civil officer of\r\nGovernment in the district of Oovah, where he was killed by lightning,\r\n1845.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: \"Quidam etiam cum equis silvestribus pugnant. Sæpe unus\r\nelephas cum sex equis committitur; atque ipse adeo interfui cum unus\r\nelephas duos equos cum primo impetu protinus prosternerit;--injecta enim\r\njugulis ipsorum longa proboscide, ad se protractos, dentibus porro\r\ncomminuit ac protrivit.\" _Angli Cujusdam in Cambayam Navigatio_. DE BRY,\r\n_Coll., &c._, vol. iii. ch. xvi. p. 31.]\r\n\r\nPigs are constantly to be seen feeding about the stables of the tame\r\nelephants, which manifest no repugnance to them. As to the smaller\r\nanimals, the elephant undoubtedly evinces uneasiness at the presence of\r\na dog, but this is referable to the same cause as its impatience of a\r\nhorse, namely, that neither is habitually seen by it in the forest; but\r\nit would be idle to suppose that this feeling could amount to hostility\r\nagainst a creature incapable of inflicting on it the slightest\r\ninjury.[1] The truth I apprehend to be that, when they meet, the\r\nimpudence and impertinences of the dog are offensive to the gravity of\r\nthe elephant, and incompatible with his love of solitude and ease. Or\r\nmay it be assumed as an evidence of the sagacity of the elephant, that\r\nthe only two animals to which it manifests an antipathy, are the two\r\nwhich it has seen only in the company of its enemy, man? One instance\r\nhas certainly been attested to me by an eye-witness, in which the trunk\r\nof an elephant was seized in the teeth of a Scotch terrier, and such was\r\nthe alarm of the huge creature that it came at once to its knees. The\r\ndog repeated the attack, and on every renewal of it the elephant\r\nretreated in terror, holding its trunk above its head, and kicking at\r\nthe terrier with its fore feet. It would have turned to flight, but for\r\nthe interference of its keeper.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: To account for the impatience manifested by the elephant at\r\nthe presence of a dog, it has been suggested that he is alarmed lest the\r\nlatter should attack _his feet_, a portion of his body of which the\r\nelephant is peculiarly careful. A tame elephant has been observed to\r\nregard with indifference a spear directed towards his head, but to\r\nshrink timidly from the same weapon when pointed at his foot.]\r\n\r\nMajor Skinner, formerly commissioner of roads in Ceylon, whose official\r\nduties in constructing highways involved the necessity of his being in\r\nthe jungle for months together, always found that, by night or by day,\r\nthe barking of a dog which accompanied him, was sufficient to put a herd\r\nto flight. On the whole, therefore, I am of opinion that the elephant\r\nlives on terms of amity with every quadruped in the forest, that it\r\nneither regards them as its foes, nor provokes their hostility by its\r\nacts; and that, with the exception of man, _its greatest enemy is a\r\nfly_!\r\n\r\nThe current statements as to the supposed animosity of the elephant to\r\nminor animals originated with Ælian and Pliny, who had probably an\r\nopportunity of seeing, what may at any time be observed, that when a\r\ncaptive elephant is picketed beside a post, the domestic animals, goats,\r\nsheep, and cattle, will annoy and irritate him by their audacity in\r\nmaking free with his provender; but this is an evidence in itself of the\r\nlittle instinctive dread which such comparatively puny creatures\r\nentertain of one so powerful and yet so gentle.\r\n\r\nAmongst elephants themselves, jealousy and other causes of irritation\r\nfrequently occasion contentions between individuals of the same herd;\r\nbut on such occasions it is their habit to strike with their trunks, and\r\nto bear down their opponents with their heads. It is doubtless correct\r\nthat an elephant, when prostrated by the force and fury of an antagonist\r\nof its own species, is often wounded by the downward pressure of the\r\ntusks, which in any other position it would be almost impossible to use\r\noffensively.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A writer in the _India Sporting Review_ for October 1857\r\nsays a male elephant was killed by two others close to his camp: \"the\r\nhead was completely smashed in; there was a large hole in the side, and\r\nthe abdomen was ripped open. The latter wound was given probably after\r\nit had fallen.\"--P. 175.]\r\n\r\nMr. Mercer, who in 1846 was the principal civil officer of Government at\r\nBadulla, sent me a jagged fragment of an elephant's tusk, about five\r\ninches in diameter, and weighing between twenty and thirty pounds, which\r\nhad been brought to him by some natives, who, being attracted by a noise\r\nin the jungle, witnessed a combat between a tusker and one without\r\ntusks, and saw the latter with his trunk seize one of the tusks of his\r\nantagonist and wrench from it the portion in question, which measured\r\ntwo feet in length.\r\n\r\nHere the trunk was shown to be the more powerful offensive weapon of the\r\ntwo; but I apprehend that the chief reliance of the elephant for defence\r\nis on its ponderous weight, the pressure of its foot being sufficient to\r\ncrush any minor assailant after being prostrated by means of its trunk.\r\nBesides, in using its feet for this purpose, it derives a wonderful\r\nfacility from the peculiar formation of the knee-joint in the hind leg,\r\nwhich, enabling it to swing the hind feet forward close to the ground,\r\nassists it to toss the body alternately from foot to foot, till deprived\r\nof life.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the Third Book of Maccabees, which is not printed in our\r\nApocrypha, but appears in the series in the Greek Septuagint, the\r\nauthor, in describing the persecution of the Jews by Ptolemy Philopater,\r\nB.C. 210, states that the king swore vehemently that he would send them\r\ninto the other world, \"foully trampled to death by the knees and feet of\r\nelephants\" ([Greek: pempsein eis hadên en gonasi kai posi thêrion\r\nhêkismenous.] 3 Mac. v. 42). ÆLIAN makes the remark, that elephants on\r\nsuch occasions use their _knees_ as well as their feet to crush their\r\nvictims.--_Hist Anim._ viii. 10.]\r\n\r\nA sportsman who had partially undergone this operation, having been\r\nseized by a wounded elephant but rescued from its fury, described to me\r\nhis sufferings as he was thus flung back and forward between the hind\r\nand fore feet of the animal, which ineffectually attempted to trample\r\nhim at each concussion, and abandoned him without inflicting serious\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nKNOX, in describing the execution of criminals by the state elephants of\r\nthe former kings of Kandy, says, \"they will run their teeth (_tusks_)\r\nthrough the body, and then tear it in pieces and throw it limb from\r\nlimb;\" but a Kandyan chief, who was witness to such scenes, has assured\r\nme that the elephant never once applied its tusks, but, placing its foot\r\non the prostrate victim, plucked off his limbs in succession by a sudden\r\nmovement of the trunk. If the tusks were designed to be employed\r\noffensively, some alertness would naturally be exhibited in using them;\r\nbut in numerous instances where sportsmen have fallen into the power of\r\na wounded elephant, they have escaped through the failure of the enraged\r\nanimal to strike them with its tusks, even when stretched upon the\r\nground.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Hastisilpe_, a Singhalese work which treats of the\r\n\"Science of Elephants,\" enumerates amongst those which it is not\r\ndesirable to possess, \"the elephant which will fight with a stone or a\r\nstick in his trunk.\"]\r\n\r\nPlaced as the elephant is in Ceylon, in the midst of the most luxuriant\r\nprofusion of its favourite food, in close proximity at all times to\r\nabundant supplies of water, and with no enemies against whom to protect\r\nitself, it is difficult to conjecture any probable utility which it\r\ncould derive from such appendages. Their absence is unaccompanied by any\r\ninconvenience to the individuals in whom they are wanting; and as\r\nregards the few who possess them, the only operations in which I am\r\naware of their tusks being employed in relation to the oeconomy of the\r\nanimal, is to assist in ripping open the stem of the jaggery palms and\r\nyoung palmyras to extract the farinaceous core; and in splitting the\r\njuicy shaft of the plantain. Whilst the tuskless elephant crushes the\r\nlatter under foot, thereby soiling it and wasting its moisture; the\r\nother, by opening it with the point of his tusk, performs the operation\r\nwith delicacy and apparent ease.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are trivial and almost accidental advantages: on the\r\nother hand, owing to irregularities in their growth, the tusks are\r\nsometimes an impediment in feeding[1]; and in more than one instance in\r\nthe Government studs, tusks which had so grown as to approach and cross\r\none another at the extremities, have had to be removed by the saw; the\r\ncontraction of space between them so impeding the free action of the\r\ntrunk as to prevent the animal from conveying branches to its mouth.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Among other eccentric forms, an elephant was seen in 1844,\r\nin the district of Bintenne, near Friar's-Hood Mountain, one of whose\r\ntusks was so bent that it took what sailors term a \"round turn,\" and\r\nresumed its curved direction as before. In the Museum of the College of\r\nSurgeons, London, there is a specimen, No. 2757, of a _spira_ tusk.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Since the foregoing remarks were written relative to the\r\nundefined use of tusks to the elephant, I have seen a speculation on the\r\nsame subject in Dr. HOLLAND'S \"_Constitution of the Animal Creation, as\r\nexpressed in structural Appendages_;\" but the conjecture of the author\r\nleaves the problem scarcely less obscure than before. Struck with the\r\nmere _supplemental_ presence of the tusks, the absence of all apparent\r\nuse serving to distinguish them from the essential organs of the\r\ncreature, Dr. HOLLAND concludes that their production is a process\r\nincident, but not ancillary, to other important ends, especially\r\nconnected with the vital functions of the trunk and the marvellous\r\nmotive powers inherent to it; his conjecture is, that they are \"a\r\nspecies of safety valve of the animal oeconomy,\"--and that \"they owe\r\ntheir development to the predominance of the senses of touch and smell,\r\nconjointly with the muscular motions of which the exercise of these is\r\naccompanied.\" \"Had there been no proboscis,\" he thinks, \"there would\r\nhave been no supplementary appendages,--the former creates the\r\nlatter.\"--Pp. 246, 271.]\r\n\r\nIt is true that in captivity, and after a due course of training, the\r\nelephant discovers a new use for its tusks when employed in moving\r\nstones and piling timber; so much so that a powerful one will raise and\r\ncarry on them a log of half a ton weight or more. One evening, whilst\r\nriding in the vicinity of Kandy, towards the scene of the massacre of\r\nMajor Davie's party in 1803, my horse evinced some excitement at a noise\r\nwhich approached us in the thick jungle, and which consisted of a\r\nrepetition of the ejaculation _urmph! urmph!_ in a hoarse and\r\ndissatisfied tone. A turn in the forest explained the mystery, by\r\nbringing me face to face with a tame elephant, unaccompanied by any\r\nattendant. He was labouring painfully to carry a heavy beam of timber,\r\nwhich he balanced across his tusks, but the pathway being narrow, he was\r\nforced to bend his head to one side to permit it to pass endways; and\r\nthe exertion and this inconvenience combined led him to utter the\r\ndissatisfied sounds which disturbed the composure of my horse. On seeing\r\nus halt, the elephant raised his head, reconnoitred us for a moment,\r\nthen flung down the timber, and voluntarily forced himself backwards\r\namong the brushwood so as to leave a passage, of which he expected us to\r\navail ourselves. My horse hesitated: the elephant observed it, and\r\nimpatiently thrust himself deeper into the jungle, repeating his cry of\r\n_urmph!_ but in a voice evidently meant to encourage us to advance.\r\nStill the horse trembled; and anxious to observe the instinct of the two\r\nsagacious animals, I forbore any interference: again the elephant of his\r\nown accord wedged himself further in amongst the trees, and manifested\r\nsome impatience that we did not pass him. At length the horse moved\r\nforward; and when we were fairly past, I saw the wise creature stoop and\r\ntake up its heavy burthen, trim and balance it on its tusks, and resume\r\nits route as before, hoarsely snorting its discontented remonstrance.\r\n\r\nBetween the African elephant and that of Ceylon, with the exception of\r\nthe striking peculiarity of the infrequency of tusks in the latter, the\r\ndistinctions are less apparent to a casual observer than to a scientific\r\nnaturalist. In the Ceylon species the forehead is higher and more\r\nhollow, the ears are smaller, and, in a section of the teeth, the\r\ngrinding ridges, instead of being lozenge-shaped, are transverse bars of\r\nuniform breadth.\r\n\r\nThe Indian elephant is stated by Cuvier to have four nails on the hind\r\nfoot, the African variety having only three: but amongst the perfections\r\nof a high-bred elephant of Ceylon, is always enumerated the possession\r\nof _twenty_ nails, whilst those of a secondary class have but eighteen\r\nin all.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Chapter on Mammalia, p. 60.]\r\n\r\nSo conversant are the natives with the structure and \"points\" of the\r\nelephant, that they divide them readily into castes, and describe with\r\nparticularity their distinctive excellences and defects. In the\r\n_Hastisilpe_, a Singhalese work which treats of their management, the\r\nmarks of inferior breeding are said to be \"eyes restless like those of a\r\ncrow, the hair of the head of mixed shades; the face wrinkled; the\r\ntongue curved and black; the nails short and green; the ears small; the\r\nneck thin, the skin freckled; the tail without a tuft, and the\r\nfore-quarter lean and low:\" whilst the perfection of form and beauty is\r\nsupposed to consist in the \"softness of the skin, the red colour of the\r\nmouth and tongue, the forehead expanded and hollow, the ears broad and\r\nrectangular, the trunk broad at the root and blotched with pink in\r\nfront; the eyes bright and kindly, the cheeks large, the neck full, the\r\nback level, the chest square, the fore legs short and convex in front,\r\nthe hind quarter plump, and five nails on each foot, all smooth,\r\npolished, and round.[1] An elephant with these perfections,\" says the\r\nauthor of the _Hastisilpe_, \"will impart glory and magnificence to the\r\nking; but he cannot be discovered amongst thousands, yea, there shall\r\nnever be found an elephant clothed at once with _all_ the excellences\r\nherein described.\" The \"points\" of an elephant are to be studied with\r\nthe greatest advantage in those attached to the temples, which are\r\nalways of the highest caste, and exhibit the most perfect breeding.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A native of rank informed me, that \"the tail of a\r\nhigh-caste elephant will sometimes touch the ground, but such are very\r\nrare.\"]\r\n\r\nThe colour of the animal's skin in a state of nature is generally of a\r\nlighter brown than that of those in captivity; a distinction which\r\narises, in all probability, not so much from the wild animal's\r\npropensity to cover itself with mud and dust, as from the superior care\r\nwhich is taken in repeatedly bathing the tame ones, and in rubbing their\r\nskins with a soft stone, a lump of burnt clay, or the coarse husk of a\r\ncoco-nut. This kind of attention, together with the occasional\r\napplication of oil, gives rise to the deeper black which the hides of\r\nthe latter present.\r\n\r\nAmongst the native Singhalese, however, a singular preference is evinced\r\nfor elephants that exhibit those flesh-coloured blotches which\r\noccasionally mottle the skin of an elephant, chiefly about the head and\r\nextremities. The front of the trunk, the tips of the ears, the forehead,\r\nand occasionally the legs, are thus diversified with stains of a\r\nyellowish tint, inclining to pink. These are not natural; nor are they\r\nhereditary, for they are seldom exhibited by the younger individuals in\r\na herd, but appear to be the result of some eruptive affection, the\r\nirritation of which has induced the animal in its uneasiness to rub\r\nitself against the rough bark of trees, and thus to destroy the outer\r\ncuticle.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is confirmed by the fact that the scar of the ancle\r\nwound, occasioned by the rope on the legs of those which have been\r\ncaptured by noosing, presents precisely the same tint in the healed\r\nparts.]\r\n\r\nTo a European these spots appear blemishes, and the taste that leads the\r\nnatives to admire them is probably akin to the feeling that has at all\r\ntimes rendered a _white elephant_ an object of wonder to Asiatics. The\r\nrarity of the latter is accounted for by regarding this peculiar\r\nappearance as the result of albinism; and notwithstanding the\r\nexaggeration of Oriental historians, who compare the fairness of such\r\ncreatures to the whiteness of snow, even in its utmost perfection, I\r\napprehend that the tint of a white elephant is little else than a\r\nflesh-colour, rendered somewhat more conspicuous by the blanching of the\r\nskin, and the lightness of the colourless hairs by which it is sparsely\r\ncovered. A white elephant is mentioned in the _Mahawanso_ as forming\r\npart of the retinue attached to the \"Temple of the Tooth\" at\r\nAnarajapoora, in the fifth century after Christ[1]; but it commanded no\r\nreligious veneration, and like those in the stud of the kings of Siam,\r\nit was tended merely as an emblem of royalty[2]; the sovereign of Ceylon\r\nbeing addressed as the \"Lord of Elephants.\"[3] In 1633 a white elephant\r\nwas exhibited in Holland[4]; but as this was some years before the Dutch\r\nhad established themselves firmly in Ceylon, it was probably brought\r\nfrom some other of their eastern possessions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Mahawanso_, ch. xxxviii. p. 254, A.D. 433.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: PALLEGOIX, _Siam, &c._, vol. i. p. 152.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Mahawanso_, ch. xviii. p. 111.

III.\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Habits when Wild_.\r\n\r\nAlthough found generally in warm and sunny climates, it is a mistake to\r\nsuppose that the elephant is partial either to heat or to light. In\r\nCeylon, the mountain tops, and not the sultry valleys, are its favourite\r\nresort. In Oovah, where the elevated plains are often crisp with the\r\nmorning frost, and on Pedura-talla-galla, at the height of upwards of\r\neight thousand feet, they are found in herds, whilst the hunter may\r\nsearch for them without success in the hot jungles of the low country.\r\nNo altitude, in fact, seems too lofty or too chill for the elephant,\r\nprovided it affords the luxury of water in abundance; and, contrary to\r\nthe general opinion that the elephant delights in sunshine, it seems at\r\nall times impatient of glare, and spends the day in the thickest depth\r\nof the forests, devoting the night to excursions, and to the luxury of\r\nthe bath, in which it also indulges occasionally by day. This partiality\r\nfor shade is doubtless ascribable to the animal's love of coolness and\r\nsolitude; but it is not altogether unconnected with the position of the\r\neye, and the circumscribed use which its peculiar mode of life permits\r\nit to make of the faculty of sight.\r\n\r\nAll the elephant hunters and natives to whom I have spoken on the\r\nsubject, concur in opinion that its range of vision is circumscribed,\r\nand that it relies more on its ear and sense of smell than on its sight,\r\nwhich is liable to be obstructed by dense foliage; besides which, from\r\nthe formation of its short neck, the elephant is incapable of directing\r\nthe range of the eye much above the level of the head.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: After writing the above, I was permitted by the late Dr.\r\nHARRISON, of Dublin, to see some accurate drawings of the brain of an\r\nelephant, which he had the opportunity of dissecting in 1847; and on\r\nlooking to that of the base, I have found a remarkable verification of\r\nthe information which I collected in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe small figure A is the ganglion of the fifth nerve, showing the small\r\nmotor and large sensitive portion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe _olfactory lobes_, from which the olfactory nerves proceed, are\r\nlarge, whilst the _optic and muscular nerves of the orbit are singularly\r\nsmall_ for so vast an animal; and one is immediately struck by the\r\nprodigious size of the fifth nerve, which supplies the proboscis with\r\nits exquisite sensibility, as well as by the great size of the motor\r\nportion of the seventh, which supplies the same organ with its power of\r\nmovement and action.]\r\n\r\nThe elephant's small range of vision is sufficient to account for its\r\nexcessive caution, its alarm at unusual noises, and the timidity and\r\npanic exhibited at trivial objects and incidents which, imperfectly\r\ndiscerned, excite suspicions for its safety.[1] In 1841 an officer[2]\r\nwas chased by an elephant that he had slightly wounded. Seizing him near\r\nthe dry bed of a river, the animal had its forefoot already raised to\r\ncrush him; but its forehead being caught at the instant by the tendrils\r\nof a climbing plant which had suspended itself from the branches above,\r\nit suddenly turned and fled; leaving him badly hurt, but with no limb\r\nbroken. I have heard similar instances, equally well attested, of this\r\npeculiarity in the elephant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Menageries, &c._, \"The Elephant,\" p. 27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Major ROGERS. An account of this singular adventure will be\r\nfound in the _Ceylon Miscellany_ for 1842, vol. i. p. 221.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the power of smell is so remarkable as almost to\r\ncompensate for the deficiency of sight. A herd is not only apprised of\r\nthe approach of danger by this means, but when scattered in the forest,\r\nand dispersed out of range of sight, they are enabled by it to\r\nreassemble with rapidity and adopt precautions for their common safety.\r\nThe same necessity is met by a delicate sense of hearing, and the use of\r\na variety of noises or calls, by means of which elephants succeed in\r\ncommunicating with each other upon all emergencies. \"The sounds which\r\nthey utter have been described by the African hunters as of three kinds:\r\nthe first, which is very shrill, produced by blowing through the trunk,\r\nis indicative of pleasure; the second, produced by the mouth, is\r\nexpressive of want; and the third, proceeding from the throat, is a\r\nterrific roar of anger or revenge.\"[1] These words convey but an\r\nimperfect idea of the variety of noises made by the elephant in Ceylon;\r\nand the shrill cry produced by blowing through his trunk, so far from\r\nbeing regarded as an indication of \"pleasure,\" is the well-known cry of\r\nrage with which he rushes to encounter an assailant. ARISTOTLE describes\r\nit as resembling the hoarse sound of a \"trumpet.\"[2] The French still\r\ndesignate the proboscis of an elephant by the same expression \"trompe,\"\r\n(which we have unmeaningly corrupted into _trunk_,) and hence the scream\r\nof the elephant is known as \"trumpeting\" by the hunters in Ceylon. Their\r\ncry when in pain, or when subjected to compulsion, is a grunt or a deep\r\ngroan from the throat, with the proboscis curled upwards and the lips\r\nwide apart.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Menageries, &c._, \"The Elephant,\" ch. iii. p. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: ARISTOTLE, _De Anim_., lib. iv. c. 9. \"[Greek: homoion\r\nsalpingi].\" See also PLINY, lib. x. ch. cxiii. A manuscript in the\r\nBritish Museum, containing the romance of \"_Alexander_\" which is\r\nprobably of the fifteenth century, is interspersed with drawings\r\nillustrative of the strange animals of the East. Amongst them are two\r\nelephants, whose trunks are literally in form of _trumpets with expanded\r\nmouths_. See WRIGHT'S _Archæological Album_, p. 176.]\r\n\r\nShould the attention of an individual in the herd be attracted by any\r\nunusual appearance in the forest, the intelligence is rapidly\r\ncommunicated by a low suppressed sound made by the lips, somewhat\r\nresembling the twittering of a bird, and described by the hunters by the\r\nword \"_prut_.\"\r\n\r\nA very remarkable noise has been described to me by more than one\r\nindividual, who has come unexpectedly upon a herd during the night, when\r\nthe alarm of the elephants was apparently too great to be satisfied with\r\nthe stealthy note of warning just described. On these occasions the\r\nsound produced resembled the hollow booming of an empty tun when struck\r\nwith a wooden mallet or a muffled sledge. Major MACREADY, Military\r\nSecretary in Ceylon in 1836, who heard it by night amongst the wild\r\nelephants in the great forest of Bintenne, describes it as \"a sort of\r\nbanging noise like a cooper hammering a cask;\" and Major SKINNER is of\r\nopinion that it must be produced by the elephant striking his sides\r\nrapidly and forcibly with his trunk. Mr. CRIPPS informs me that he has\r\nmore than once seen an elephant, when surprised or alarmed, produce this\r\nsound by striking the ground forcibly with the flat side of the trunk;\r\nand this movement was instantly succeeded by raising it again, and\r\npointing it in the direction whence the alarm proceeded, as if to\r\nascertain by the sense of smell the nature of the threatened danger. As\r\nthis strange sound is generally mingled with the bellowing and ordinary\r\ntrumpeting of the herd, it is in all probability a device resorted to,\r\nnot alone for warning their companions of some approaching peril, but\r\nalso for the additional purpose of terrifying unseen intruders.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PALLEGOIX, in his _Description du Royaume Thai ou Siam_,\r\nadverts to a sound produced by the elephant when weary: \"quand il est\r\nfatigué, _il frappe la terre avec sa_ trompe, et en tire un son\r\nsemblable à celui du cor.\"--Tom. i. p. 151.]\r\n\r\nElephants are subject to deafness; and the Singhalese regard as the most\r\nformidable of all wild animals, a \"rogue\"[1] afflicted with this\r\ninfirmity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an explanation of the term \"rogue\" as applied to an\r\nelephant, see p. 115.]\r\n\r\nExtravagant estimates are recorded of the height of the elephant. In an\r\nage when popular fallacies in relation to him were as yet uncorrected in\r\nEurope by the actual inspection of the living animal, he was supposed to\r\ngrow to the height of twelve or fifteen feet. Even within the last\r\ncentury in popular works on natural history, the elephant, when full\r\ngrown, was said to measure from seventeen to twenty feet from the ground\r\nto the shoulder.[1] At a still later period, so imperfectly had the\r\nfacts been collated, that the elephant of Ceylon was believed \"to excel\r\nthat of Africa in size and strength.\"[2] But so far from equalling the\r\nsize of the African species, that of Ceylon seldom exceeds the height of\r\nnine feet; even in the Hambangtotte country, where the hunters agree\r\nthat the largest specimens are to be found, the tallest of ordinary\r\nherds do not average more than eight feet. WOLF, in his account of the\r\nCeylon elephant[3], says he saw one taken near Jaffna, which measured\r\ntwelve feet and one inch high. But the truth is, that the general bulk\r\nof the elephant so far exceeds that of the animals which we are\r\naccustomed to see daily, that the imagination magnifies its unusual\r\ndimensions; and I have seldom or ever met with an inexperienced\r\nspectator who did not unconsciously over-estimate the size of an\r\nelephant shown to him, whether in captivity or in a state of nature.\r\nMajor DENHAM would have guessed some which he saw in Africa to be\r\nsixteen feet in height, but the largest when killed was found to measure\r\nnine feet six, from the foot to the hip-bone.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Natural History of Animals_. By Sir JOHN HILL, M.D.\r\nLondon, 1748-52, p. 565. A probable source of these false estimates is\r\nmentioned by a writer in the _Indian Sporting Review_ for Oct. 1857.\r\n\"Elephants were measured formerly, and even now, by natives, as to their\r\nheight, by throwing a rope over them, the ends brought to the ground on\r\neach side, and half the length taken as the true height. Hence the\r\norigin of elephants fifteen and sixteen feet high. A rod held at right\r\nangles to the measuring rod, and parallel to the ground, will rarely\r\ngive more than ten feet, the majority being under nine.\"--P. 159.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: SHAW'S _Zoology_.

Wolf was a\r\nnative of Mecklenburg, who arrived in Ceylon about 1750, as chaplain in\r\none of the Dutch East Indiamen, and having been taken into the\r\ngovernment employment, he served for twenty years at Jaffna, first as\r\nSecretary to the Governor, and afterwards in an office the duties of\r\nwhich he describes to be the examination and signature of the \"writings\r\nwhich served to commence a suit in any of the Courts of justice.\" His\r\nbook embodies a truthful and generally accurate account of the northern\r\nportion of the island, with which alone he was conversant, and his\r\nnarrative gives a curious insight into the policy of the Dutch\r\nGovernment, and of the condition of the natives under their dominion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: DENHAM'S _Travels, &c_., 4to p. 220. The fossil remains of\r\nthe Indian elephant have been discovered at Jabalpur, showing a height\r\nof fifteen feet.--_Journ. Asiat. Soc. Beng_. vi. Professor ANSTED in his\r\n_Ancient World_, p. 197, says he was informed by Dr. Falconer \"that out\r\nof eleven hundred elephants from which the tallest were selected and\r\nmeasured with care, on one occasion in India, there was not one whose\r\nheight equalled eleven feet.\"]\r\n\r\nFor a creature of such extraordinary weight it is astonishing how\r\nnoiselessly and stealthily the elephant can escape from a pursuer. When\r\nsuddenly disturbed in the jungle, it will burst away with a rush that\r\nseems to bear down all before it; but the noise sinks into absolute\r\nstillness so suddenly, that a novice might well be led to suppose that\r\nthe fugitive had only halted within a few yards of him, when further\r\nsearch will disclose that it has stolen silently away, making scarcely a\r\nsound in its escape; and, stranger still, leaving the foliage almost\r\nundisturbed by its passage.\r\n\r\nThe most venerable delusion respecting the elephant, and that which held\r\nits ground with unequalled tenacity, is the ancient fallacy which is\r\nexplained by SIR THOMAS BROWNE in his _Pseudodoxia Epidemica_, that \"it\r\nhath no joynts; and this absurdity is seconded by another, that being\r\nunable to lye downe it sleepeth against a tree, which the hunters\r\nobserving doe saw almost asunder, whereon the beast relying, by the fall\r\nof the tree falls also downe it-selfe and is able to rise no more.\"[1]\r\nSir THOMAS is disposed to think that \"the hint and ground of this\r\nopinion might be the grosse and somewhat cylindricall composure of the\r\nlegs of the elephant, and the equality and lesse perceptible disposure\r\nof the joynts, especially in the forelegs of this animal, they\r\nappearing, when he standeth, like pillars of flesh;\" but he overlooks\r\nthe fact that PLINY has ascribed the same peculiarity to the\r\nScandinavian beast somewhat resembling a horse, which he calls a\r\n\"machlis,\"[2] and that CÆSAR in describing the wild animals in the\r\nHercynian forests, enumerates the _alce_, \"in colour and configuration\r\napproaching the goat, but surpassing it in size, its head destitute of\r\nhorns _and its limbs of joints_, whence it can neither lie down to rest,\r\nnor rise if by any accident it should fall, but using the trees for a\r\nresting-place, the hunters by loosening their roots bring the _alce_ to\r\nthe ground, so soon as it is tempted to lean on them.\"[3] This fallacy,\r\nas Sir THOMAS BROWNE says, is \"not the daughter of latter times, but an\r\nold and grey-headed errour, even in the days of ARISTOTLE,\" who deals\r\nwith the story as he received it from CTESIAS, by whom it appears to\r\nhave been embodied in his lost work on India. But although ARISTOTLE\r\ngenerally receives the credit of having exposed and demolished the\r\nfallacy of CTESIAS, it will be seen by a reference to his treatise _On\r\nthe Progressive Motions of Animals_, that in reality he approached the\r\nquestion with some hesitation, and has not only left it doubtful in one\r\npassage whether the elephant has joints _in his knee_, although he\r\ndemonstrates that it has joints in the shoulders[4]; but in another he\r\ndistinctly affirms that on account of his weight the elephant cannot\r\nbend his forelegs together, but only one at a time, and reclines to\r\nsleep on that particular side.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Vulgar Errors_, book iii. chap. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Machlis (said to be derived from _a_, priv., and [Greek:\r\nklinô], _cubo_, quod non cubat). \"Moreover in the island of Scandinavia\r\nthere is a beast called _Machlis_, that hath neither ioynt in the hough,\r\nnor pasternes in his hind legs, and therefore he never lieth down, but\r\nsleepeth leaning to a tree, wherefore the hunters that lie in wait for\r\nthese beasts cut downe the trees while they are asleepe, and so take\r\nthem; otherwise they should never be taken, they are so swift of foot\r\nthat it is wonderful.\"--PLINY, _Natur.

NERO. D. 1. fol. 168, b.]\r\n\r\nIn the numerous mediæval treatises on natural history, known under the\r\ntitle of _Bestiaries_, this delusion regarding the elephant is often\r\nrepeated; and it is given at length in a metrical version of the\r\n_Physiologus_ of THEOBALDUS, amongst the Arundel Manuscripts in the\r\nBritish Museum.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Arundel MSS_.

It has been printed in\r\nthe _Reliquiæ Antiquæ_, vol. i. p. 208, by Mr. WRIGHT, to whom I am\r\nindebted for the following rendering of the passage referred to:--\r\n\r\n    in water ge sal stonden\r\n    in water to mid side\r\n    that wanne hire harde tide\r\n    that ge ne falle nither nogt\r\n    that it most in hire thogt\r\n    for he ne haven no lith\r\n    that he mugen risen with, etc.\r\n\r\n  \"They will stand in the water,\r\n  in water up to the middle of the side,\r\n  that when it comes to them hard,\r\n  they may not fall down:\r\n  that is most in their thought,\r\n  for they have no joint\r\n  to enable them to rise again.\r\n  How he resteth him this animal,\r\n  when he walketh abroad,\r\n  hearken how it is here told.\r\n  For he is all unwieldy,\r\n  forsooth he seeks out a tree,\r\n  that it strong and stedfast,\r\n  and leans confidently against it,\r\n  when he is weary of walking.\r\n  The hunter has observed this,\r\n  who seeks to ensnare him,\r\n  where his usual dwelling is,\r\n  to do his will;\r\n  saws this tree and props it\r\n  in the manner that he best may,\r\n  covers it well that he (the elephant) may not be on his guard.\r\n  Then he makes thereby a seat,\r\n  himself sits alone and watches\r\n  whether his trap takes effect.\r\n  Then cometh this unwieldy elephant,\r\n  and leans him on his side,\r\n  rests against the tree in the shadow,\r\n  and so both fall together.\r\n  If nobody be by when he falls,\r\n  he roars ruefully and calls for help,\r\n  roars ruefully in his manner,\r\n  hopes he shall through help rise.\r\n  Then cometh there one (elephant) in haste,\r\n  hopes he shall cause him to stand up;\r\n  labours and tries all his might,\r\n  but he cannot succeed a bit.\r\n  He knows then no other remedy,\r\n  but roars with his brother,\r\n  many and large (elephants) come there in search,\r\n  thinking to make him get up,\r\n  but for the help of them all\r\n  he may not get up.\r\n  Then they all roar one roar,\r\n  like the blast of a horn or the sound of bell,\r\n  for their great roaring\r\n  a young one cometh running,\r\n  stoops immediately to him,\r\n  puts his snout under him,\r\n  and asks the help of them all;\r\n  this elephant they raise on his legs:\r\n  and thus fails this hunter's trick,\r\n  in the manner that I have told you.\"]\r\n\r\nWith the Provençal song writers, the helplessness of the fallen elephant\r\nwas a favourite simile, and amongst others RICHARD DE BARBEZIEUX, in the\r\nlatter half of the twelfth century, sung[1],\r\n\r\n  \"Atressi cum l'olifans\r\n  Que quan chai no s'pot levar.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: One of the most venerable authorities by whom the fallacy\r\nwas transmitted to modern times was PHILIP de THAUN, who wrote, about\r\nthe year 1121, A.D., his _Livre des Créatures_, dedicated to Adelaide of\r\nLouvaine, Queen of Henry I. of England. In the copy of it printed by the\r\nHistorical Society of Science in 1841, and edited by Mr. WRIGHT, the\r\nfollowing passage occurs:--\r\n\r\n  \"Et Ysidre nus dit ki le elefant descrit,\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Es jambes par nature nen ad que une jointure,\r\n  Il ne pot pas gesir quant il se volt dormir,\r\n  Ke si cuchet estait par sei nen leveraît;\r\n  Pur ceo li stot apuier, el lui del cucher,\r\n  U à arbre u à mur, idunc dort aseur.\r\n\r\n  E le gent de la terre, ki li volent conquere,\r\n  Li mur enfunderunt, u le arbre encíserunt;\r\n  Quant li elefant vendrat, ki s'i apuierat,\r\n  La arbre u le mur carrat, e il tribucherat;\r\n  Issi faiterement le parnent cele gent.\"\r\n  P. 100.]\r\n\r\nAs elephants were but rarely seen in Europe prior to the seventeenth\r\ncentury, there were but few opportunities of correcting the popular\r\nfallacy by ocular demonstration.

III. ch. xii. p. 147.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: THOMSON'S _Seasons_, A.D. 1728.]\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to see whence this antiquated delusion took its\r\norigin; nor is it, as Sir THOMAS BROWNE imagined, to be traced\r\nexclusively \"to the grosse and cylindricall structure\" of the animal's\r\nlegs. The fact is, that the elephant, returning in the early morning\r\nfrom his nocturnal revels in the reservoirs and water-courses, is\r\naccustomed to rub his muddy sides against a tree, and sometimes\r\nagainst a rock if more convenient. In my rides through the northern\r\nforests, the natives of Ceylon have often pointed out that the\r\nelephants which had preceded me must have been of considerable size,\r\nfrom the height at which their marks had been left on the trees\r\nagainst which they had been rubbing. Not unfrequently the animals\r\nthemselves, overcome with drowsiness from the night's gambolling, are\r\nfound dosing and resting against the trees they had so visited, and in\r\nthe same manner they have been discovered by sportsmen asleep, and\r\nleaning against a rock.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to explain that the position is accidental, and\r\nthat it is taken by the elephant not from any difficulty in lying at\r\nlength on the ground, but rather from the coincidence that the structure\r\nof his legs affords such support in a standing position, that reclining\r\nscarcely adds to his enjoyment of repose; and elephants in a state of\r\ncaptivity have been known for months together to sleep without lying\r\ndown.[1] So distinctive is this formation, and so self-sustaining the\r\nconfiguration of the limbs, that an elephant shot in the brain, by Major\r\nRogers in 1836, was killed so instantaneously that it died literally _on\r\nits knees_, and remained resting on them. About the year 1826, Captain\r\nDawson, the engineer of the great road to Kandy, over the Kaduganava\r\npass, shot an elephant at Hangwelle on the banks of the Kalany Ganga;\r\n_it remained on its feet_, but so motionless, that after discharging a\r\nfew more balls, he was induced to go close to it, and found it dead.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: So little is the elephant inclined to lie down in\r\ncaptivity, and even after hard labour, that the keepers are generally\r\ndisposed to suspect illness when he betakes himself to this posture.\r\nPHILE, in his poem _De Animalium Proprietate_, attributes the propensity\r\nof the elephant to sleep on his legs, to the difficulty he experiences\r\nin rising to his feet:\r\n\r\n    [Greek:\r\n    'Orthostadên de kai katheudei panychos\r\n    'HOt ouk anastêsai men eucherôs pelei.]\r\n\r\nBut this is a misapprehension.]\r\n\r\nThe real peculiarity in the elephant in lying down is, that he extends\r\nhis hind legs backwards as a man does when he kneels, instead of\r\nbringing them under him like the horse or any other quadruped. The wise\r\npurpose of this arrangement must be obvious to any one who observes the\r\nstruggle with which the horse _gets up_ from the ground, and the violent\r\nefforts which he makes to raise himself erect. Such an exertion in the\r\ncase of the elephant, and the force requisite to apply a similar\r\nmovement to raise his weight (equal to four or five tons) would be\r\nattended with a dangerous strain upon the muscles, and hence the simple\r\narrangement, which by enabling him to draw the hind feet gradually under\r\nhim, assists him to rise without a perceptible effort.\r\n\r\nThe same construction renders his gait not a \"gallop,\" as it has been\r\nsomewhat loosely described[1], which would be too violent a motion for\r\nso vast a body; but a shuffle, that he can increase at pleasure to a\r\npace as rapid as that of a man at full speed, but which he cannot\r\nmaintain for any considerable distance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Menageries, &c_. \"The elephant,\" ch. i. Sir CHARLES BELL,\r\nin his essay on _The Hand and its Mechanism_, which forms one of the\r\n\"Bridgewater Treatises,\" has exhibited the reasons deducible from\r\norganisation, which show the incapacity of the elephant to _spring_ or\r\n_leap_ like the horse and other animals whose structure is designed to\r\nfacilitate agility and speed. In them the various bones of the shoulder\r\nand fore limbs, especially the clavicle and humerus, are set at such an\r\nangle, that the shock in descending is modified, and the joints and\r\nsockets protected from the injury occasioned by concussion. But in the\r\nelephant, where the weight of the body is immense, the bones of the leg,\r\nin order to present solidify and strength to sustain it, are built in\r\none firm and perpendicular column; instead of being placed somewhat\r\nobliquely at their points of contact. Thus whilst the force of the\r\nweight in descending is broken and distributed by this arrangement in\r\nthe case of the horse; it would be so concentrated in the elephant as to\r\nendanger every joint from the toe to the shoulder.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is to the structure of the knee-joint that the elephant is indebted\r\nfor his singular facility in ascending and descending steep activities,\r\nclimbing rocks and traversing precipitous ledges, where even a mule dare\r\nnot venture; and this again leads to the correction of another generally\r\nreceived error, that his legs are \"formed more for strength than\r\nflexibility, and fitted to bear an enormous weight upon a level surface,\r\nwithout the necessity of ascending or descending great acclivities.\"[1]\r\nThe same authority assumes that, although the elephant is found in the\r\nneighbourhood of mountainous ranges, and will even ascend rocky passes,\r\nsuch a service is a violation of its natural habits.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Menageries, &c_., \"The Elephant,\" ch. ii.]\r\n\r\nOf the elephant of Africa I am not qualified to speak, nor of the nature\r\nof the ground which it most frequents; but certainly the facts in\r\nconnection with the elephant of India are all irreconcilable with the\r\ntheory mentioned above. In Bengal, in the Nilgherries, in Nepal, in\r\nBurmah, in Siam, Sumatra, and Ceylon, the districts in which the\r\nelephants most abound, are all hilly and mountainous. In the latter,\r\nespecially, there is not a range so elevated as to be inaccessible to\r\nthem. On the very summit of Adam's Peak, at an altitude of 7,420 feet,\r\nand on a pinnacle which the pilgrims climb with difficulty, by means of\r\nsteps hewn in the rock, Major Skinner, in 1840, found the spoor of an\r\nelephant.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1840, and before coffee-plantations had been extensively opened\r\nin the Kandyan ranges, there was not a mountain or a lofty feature of\r\nland of Ceylon which they had not traversed, in their periodical\r\nmigrations in search of water; and the sagacity which they display in\r\n\"laying out roads\" is almost incredible. They generally keep along the\r\n_backbone_ of a chain of hills, avoiding steep gradients: and one\r\ncurious observation was not lost upon the government surveyors, that in\r\ncrossing the valleys from ridge to ridge, through forests so dense as\r\naltogether to obstruct a distant view, the elephants invariably select\r\nthe line of march which communicates most judiciously with the opposite\r\npoint, by means of _the safest ford_.[1] So sure-footed are they, that\r\nthere are few places where man can go that an elephant cannot follow,\r\nprovided there be space to admit his bulk, and solidity to sustain his\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. HOOKER, in describing the ascent of the Himalayas,\r\nsays, the natives in making their paths despise all zigzags, and run in\r\nstraight lines up the steepest hill faces; whilst \"the elephant's path\r\nis an excellent specimen of engineering--the opposite of the native\r\ntrack,--for it winds judiciously.\"--_Himalayan Journal_, vol. i. ch.\r\niv.]\r\n\r\nThis faculty is almost entirely derived from the unusual position, as\r\ncompared with other quadrupeds, of the knee joint of the hind leg;\r\narising from the superior length of the thigh-bone, and the shortness of\r\nthe metatarsus: the heel being almost where it projects in man, instead\r\nof being lifted up as a \"hock.\" It is this which enables him, in\r\ndescending declivities, to depress and adjust the weight of his hinder\r\nportions, which would otherwise overbalance and force him headlong.[1]\r\nIt is by the same arrangement that he is enabled, on uneven ground, to\r\nlift his feet, which are tender and sensitive, with delicacy, and plant\r\nthem with such precision as to ensure his own safety as well as that of\r\nobjects which it is expedient to avoid touching.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Since the above passage was written, I have seen in the\r\n_Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal_, vol. xiii, pt. ii. p. 916, a\r\npaper upon this subject, illustrated by the subjoined diagram.\r\n\r\nThe writer says, \"an elephant descending a bank of too acute an angle to\r\nadmit of his walking down it direct, (which, were he to attempt, his\r\nhuge tody, soon disarranging the centre of gravity, would certainly\r\ntopple over,) proceeds thus. His first manoeuvre is to kneel down close\r\nto the edge of the declivity, placing his chest to the ground: one\r\nfore-leg is then cautiously passed a short way down the slope; and if\r\nthere is no natural protection to afford a firm footing, he speedily\r\nforms one by stamping into the soil if moist, or kicking out a footing\r\nif dry. This point gained, the other fore-leg is brought down in the\r\nsame way; and performs the same work, a little in advance of the first;\r\nwhich is thus at liberty to move lower still. Then, first one and then\r\nthe second of the hind legs is carefully drawn over the side, and the\r\nhind-feet in turn occupy the resting-places previously used and left by\r\nthe fore ones. The course, however, in such precipitous ground is not\r\nstraight from top to bottom, but slopes along the face of the bank,\r\ndescending till the animal gains the level below. This an elephant has\r\ndone, at an angle of 45 degrees, carrying a _howdah_, its occupant, his\r\nattendant, and sporting apparatus; and in a much less time than it takes\r\nto describe the operation.\" I have observed that an elephant in\r\ndescending a declivity uses his knees, on the side next the bank; and\r\nhis feet on the lower side only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]]\r\n\r\nA _herd_ of elephants is a family, not a group whom accident or\r\nattachment may have induced to associate together. Similarity of\r\nfeatures and caste attest that, among the various individuals which\r\ncompose it, there is a common lineage and relationship. In a herd of\r\ntwenty-one elephants, captured in 1844, the trunks of each individual\r\npresented the same peculiar formation,--long, and almost of one uniform\r\nbreadth throughout, instead of tapering gradually from the root to the\r\nnostril. In another instance, the eyes of thirty-five taken in one\r\ncorral were of the same colour in each. The same slope of the back, the\r\nsame form of the forehead, is to be detected in the majority of the same\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nIn the forest several herds will browse in close contiguity, and in\r\ntheir expeditions in search of water they may form a body of possibly\r\none or two hundred; but on the slightest disturbance each distinct herd\r\nhastens to re-form within its own particular circle, and to take\r\nmeasures on its own behalf for retreat or defence.\r\n\r\nThe natives of any place which may chance to be frequented by elephants,\r\nobserve that the numbers of the same herd fluctuate very slightly; and\r\nhunters in pursuit of them, who may chance to have shot one or more,\r\nalways reckon with certainty the precise number of those remaining,\r\nalthough a considerable interval may intervene before they again\r\nencounter them. The proportion of males is generally small, and some\r\nherds have been seen composed exclusively of females; possibly in\r\nconsequence of the males having been shot. A herd usually consists of\r\nfrom ten to twenty individuals, though occasionally they exceed the\r\nlatter number; and in their frequent migrations and nightly resort to\r\ntanks and water-courses, alliances are formed between members of\r\nassociated herds, which serve to introduce new blood into the family.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the attachment of the elephant to its young, the\r\nauthority of KNOX has been quoted, that \"the shees are alike tender of\r\nany one's young ones as of their own.\"[1] Their affection in this\r\nparticular is undoubted, but I question whether it exceeds that of other\r\nanimals; and the trait thus adduced of their indiscriminate kindness to\r\nall the young of the herd,--of which I have myself been an\r\neye-witness,--so far from being an evidence of the strength of parental\r\nattachment individually, is, perhaps, somewhat inconsistent with the\r\nexistence of such a passion to any extraordinary degree.[2] In fact,\r\nsome individuals, who have had extensive facilities for observation,\r\ndoubt whether the fondness of the female elephants for their offspring\r\nis so great as that of many other animals; as instances are not wanting\r\nin Ceylon, in which, when pursued by the hunters, the herd has abandoned\r\nthe young ones in their flight, notwithstanding the cries of the latter\r\nfor help.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A correspondent of Buffon, M. MARCELLUS BLES, Seigneur de\r\nMoergestal, who resided eleven years in Ceylon in the time of the Dutch,\r\nsays in one of his communications, that in herds of forty or fifty,\r\nenclosed in a single corral, there were frequently very young calves;\r\nand that \"on ne pouvoit pas reconnaître quelles étoient les mères de\r\nchacun de ces petits éléphans, car tous ces jeunes animaux paroissent\r\nfaire manse commune; ils têtent indistinctement celles des femelles de\r\ntoute la troupe qui ont du lait, soit qu'elles aient elles-mêmes un\r\npetit en propre, soit qu'elles n'en aient point.\"--BUFFON, _Suppl. à\r\nl'Hist. des Anim._, vol. vi. p. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: WHITE, in his _Natural History of Selborne_, philosophising\r\non the fact which had fallen under his own notice of this indiscriminate\r\nsuckling of the young of one animal by the parent of another, is\r\ndisposed to ascribe it to a selfish feeling; the pleasure and relief of\r\nhaving its distended teats drawn by this intervention. He notices the\r\ncircumstance of a leveret having been thus nursed by a cat, whose\r\nkittens had been recently drowned: and observes, that \"this strange\r\naffection was probably occasioned by that desiderium, those tender\r\nmaternal feelings, which the loss of her kittens had awakened in her\r\nbreast; and by the complacency and ease she derived to herself from\r\nprocuring her teats to be drawn, which were too much distended with\r\nmilk; till from habit she became as much delighted with this foundling\r\nas if it had been her real offspring. This incident is no bad solution\r\nof that strange circumstance which grave historians, as well as the\r\npoets, assert of exposed children being sometimes nurtured by female\r\nwild beasts that probably had lost their young. For it is not one whit\r\nmore marvellous that Romulus and Remus in their infant state should be\r\nnursed by a she wolf than that a poor little suckling leveret should be\r\nfostered and cherished by a bloody Grimalkin.\"--WHITE'S _Selborne_,\r\nlett. xx.]\r\n\r\nIn an interesting paper on the habits of the Indian elephant, published\r\nin the _Philosophical Transactions for_ 1793, Mr. CORSE says: \"If a wild\r\nelephant happens to be separated from its young for only two days,\r\nthough giving suck, she never after recognises or acknowledges it,\"\r\nalthough the young one evidently knows its dam, and by its plaintive\r\ncries and submissive approaches solicits her assistance.\r\n\r\nIf by any accident an elephant becomes hopelessly separated from his own\r\nherd, he is not permitted to attach himself to any other. He may browse\r\nin the vicinity, or frequent the same place to drink and to bathe; but\r\nthe intercourse is only on a distant and conventional footing, and no\r\nfamiliarity or intimate association is under any circumstances\r\npermitted. To such a height is this exclusiveness carried, that even\r\namidst the terror and stupefaction of an elephant corral, when an\r\nindividual, detached from his own party in the _mêlée_ and confusion,\r\nhas been driven into the enclosure with an unbroken herd, I have seen\r\nhim repulsed in every attempt to take refuge among them, and driven off\r\nby heavy blows with their trunks as often as he attempted to insinuate\r\nhimself within the circle which they had formed for common security.\r\nThere can be no reasonable doubt that this jealous and exclusive policy\r\nnot only contributes to produce, but mainly serves to perpetuate, the\r\nclass of solitary elephants which are known by the term _goondahs_, in\r\nIndia, and which from their vicious propensities and predatory habits\r\nare called _Hora_, or _Rogues_, in Ceylon.[1]\r\n\r\nIt is believed by the Singhalese that these are either individuals, who\r\nby accident have lost their former associates and become morose and\r\nsavage from rage and solitude; or else that being naturally vicious they\r\nhave become daring from the yielding habits of their milder companions,\r\nand eventually separated themselves from the rest of the herd which had\r\nrefused to associate with them. Another conjecture is, that being almost\r\nuniversally males, the death or capture of particular females may have\r\ndetached them from their former companions in search of fresh\r\nalliances.[2] It is also believed that a tame elephant escaping from\r\ncaptivity, unable to rejoin its former herd, and excluded from any\r\nother, becomes a \"_rogue_\" from necessity. In Ceylon it is generally\r\nbelieved that the _rogues_ are all males (but of this I am not certain),\r\nand so sullen is their disposition that although two may be in the same\r\nvicinity, there is no known instance of their associating, or of a\r\n_rogue_ being seen in company with another elephant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The term \"rogue\" is scarcely sufficiently accounted for by\r\nsupposing it to be the English equivalent for the Singhalese word\r\n_Hora_. In that very curious book, the _Life and Adventures of_ JOHN\r\nCHRISTOPHER WOLF, _late principal Secretary at Jaffnapatam in Ceylon_,\r\nthe author says, when a male elephant in a quarrel about the females \"is\r\nbeat out of the field and obliged to go without a consort, he becomes\r\nfurious and mad, killing every living creature, be it man or beast: and\r\nin this state is called _ronkedor_, an object of greater terror to a\r\ntraveller than a hundred wild ones.\"--P. 142. In another passage, p.\r\n164, he is called _runkedor_, and I have seen it spelt elsewhere\r\n_ronquedue_, WOLF does not give \"_ronkedor_\" as a term peculiar to that\r\nsection of the island; but both there and elsewhere, it is obsolete at\r\nthe present day, unless it be open to conjecture that the modern term\r\n\"rogue\" is a modification of _ronquedue._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: BUCHANAN, in his _Survey of Bhagulpore_, p. 503, says that\r\nsolitary males of the wild buffalo, \"when driven from the herd by\r\nstronger competitors for female society, are reckoned very dangerous to\r\nmeet with; for they are apt to wreak their vengeance on whatever they\r\nmeet, and are said to kill annually three or four people.\" LIVINGSTONE\r\nrelates the same of the solitary hippopotamus which becomes soured in\r\ntemper, and wantonly attacks the passing canoes.--_Travels in South\r\nAfrica_, p. 231.]\r\n\r\nThey spend their nights in marauding, often about the dwellings of men,\r\ndestroying their plantations, trampling down their gardens, and\r\ncommitting serious ravages in rice grounds and young coco-nut\r\nplantations. Hence from their closer contact with man and his dwellings,\r\nthese outcasts become disabused of many of the terrors which render the\r\nordinary elephant timid and needlessly cautious; they break through\r\nfences without fear; and even in the daylight a _rogue_ has been known\r\nnear Ambogammoa to watch a field of labourers at work in reaping rice,\r\nand boldly to walk in amongst them, seize a sheaf from the heap, and\r\nretire leisurely to the jungle. By day they generally seek concealment,\r\nbut are frequently to be met with prowling about the by-roads and jungle\r\npaths, where travellers are exposed to the utmost risk from their savage\r\nassaults. It is probable that this hostility to man is the result of the\r\nenmity engendered by those measures which the natives, who have a\r\nconstant dread of their visits, adopt for the protection of their\r\ngrowing crops. In some districts, especially in the low country of\r\nBadulla, the villagers occasionally enclose their cottages with rude\r\nwalls of earth and branches to protect them from nightly assaults. In\r\nplaces infested by them, the visits of European sportsmen to the\r\nvicinity of their haunts are eagerly encouraged by the natives, who\r\nthink themselves happy in lending their services to track the ordinary\r\nherds in consideration of the benefit conferred on the village\r\ncommunities by the destruction of a rogue. In 1847 one of these\r\nformidable creatures frequented for some months the Rangbodde Pass on\r\nthe great mountain road leading to the sanatarium, at Neuera-ellia; and\r\namongst other excesses, killed a Caffre belonging to the corps of Caffre\r\npioneers, by seizing him with its trunk and beating him to death against\r\nthe bank.\r\n\r\nTo return to the herd: one member of it, usually the largest and most\r\npowerful, is by common consent implicitly followed as leader. A tusker,\r\nif there be one in the party, is generally observed to be the commander;\r\nbut a female, if of superior energy, is as readily obeyed as a male. In\r\nfact, in this promotion there is no reason to doubt that supremacy is\r\nalmost unconsciously assumed by those endowed with superior vigour and\r\ncourage rather than from the accidental possession of greater bodily\r\nstrength; and the devotion and loyalty which the herd evince to their\r\nleader are very remarkable. This is more readily seen in the case of a\r\ntusker than any other, because in a herd he is generally the object of\r\nthe keenest pursuit by the hunters. On such occasions the others do\r\ntheir utmost to protect him from danger: when driven to extremity they\r\nplace their leader in the centre and crowd so eagerly in front of him\r\nthat the sportsmen have to shoot a number which they might otherwise\r\nhave spared. In one instance a tusker, which was badly wounded by Major\r\nROGERS, was promptly surrounded by his companions, who supported him\r\nbetween their shoulders, and actually succeeded in covering his retreat\r\nto the forest.\r\n\r\nThose who have lived much in the jungle in Ceylon, and who have had\r\nconstant opportunities of watching the habits of wild elephants, have\r\nwitnessed instances of the submission of herds to their leaders, that\r\nsuggest an inquiry of singular interest as to the means adopted by the\r\nlatter to communicate with distinctness, orders which are observed with\r\nthe most implicit obedience by their followers. The following narrative\r\nof an adventure in the great central forest toward the north of the\r\nisland, communicated to me by Major SKINNER, who was engaged for some\r\ntime in surveying and opening roads through the thickly-wooded districts\r\nthere, will serve better than any abstract description to convey an idea\r\nof the conduct of a herd on such occasions:--\r\n\r\n\"The case you refer to struck me as exhibiting something more than\r\nordinary brute instinct, and approached nearer to reasoning powers than\r\nany other instance I can now remember. I cannot do justice to the scene,\r\nalthough it appeared to me at the time to be so remarkable that it left\r\na deep impression in my mind.\r\n\r\n\"In the height of the dry season in Neuera-Kalawa, you know the streams\r\nare all dried up, and the tanks nearly so. All animals are then sorely\r\npressed for water, and they congregate in the vicinity of those tanks in\r\nwhich there may remain ever so little of the precious element.\r\n\r\n\"During one of those seasons I was encamped on the bund or embankment of\r\na very small tank, the water in which was so dried that its surface\r\ncould not have exceeded an area of 500 square yards. It was the only\r\npond within many miles, and I knew that of necessity a very large herd\r\nof elephants, which had been in the neighbourhood all day, must resort\r\nto it at night.\r\n\r\n\"On the lower side of the tank, and in a line with the embankment, was a\r\nthick forest, in which the elephants sheltered themselves during the\r\nday. On the upper side and all around the tank there was a considerable\r\nmargin of open ground. It was one of those beautiful bright, clear,\r\nmoonlight nights, when objects could be seen almost as distinctly as by\r\nday, and I determined to avail myself of the opportunity to observe the\r\nmovements of the herd, which had already manifested some uneasiness at\r\nour presence. The locality was very favourable for my purpose, and an\r\nenormous tree projecting over the tank afforded me a secure lodgement in\r\nits branches. Having ordered the fires of my camp to be extinguished at\r\nan early hour, and all my followers to retire to rest, I took up my post\r\nof observation on the overhanging bough; but I had to remain for upwards\r\nof two hours before anything was to be seen or heard of the elephants,\r\nalthough I knew they were within 500 yards of me. At length, about the\r\ndistance of 300 yards from the water, an unusually large elephant issued\r\nfrom the dense cover, and advanced cautiously across the open ground to\r\nwithin 100 yards of the tank, where he stood perfectly motionless. So\r\nquiet had the elephants become (although they had been roaring and\r\nbreaking the jungle throughout the day and evening), that not a movement\r\nwas now to be heard. The huge vidette remained in his position, still as\r\na rock, for a few minutes, and then made three successive stealthy\r\nadvances of several yards (halting for some minutes between each, with\r\nears bent forward to catch the slightest sound), and in this way he\r\nmoved slowly up to the water's edge. Still he did not venture to quench\r\nhis thirst, for though his fore-feet were partially in the tank and his\r\nvast body was reflected clear in the water, he remained for some minutes\r\nlistening in perfect stillness. Not a motion could be perceived in\r\nhimself or his shadow. He returned cautiously and slowly to the position\r\nhe had at first taken up on emerging from the forest. Here in a little\r\nwhile he was joined by five others, with which he again proceeded as\r\ncautiously, but less slowly than before, to within a few yards of the\r\ntank, and then posted his patrols. He then re-entered the forest and\r\ncollected around him the whole herd, which must have amounted to between\r\n80 and 100 individuals,--led them across the open ground with the most\r\nextraordinary composure and quietness, till he joined the advanced\r\nguard, when he left them for a moment and repeated his former\r\nreconnoissance at the edge of the tank. After which, having apparently\r\nsatisfied himself that all was safe, he returned and obviously gave the\r\norder to advance, for in a moment the whole herd rushed into the water\r\nwith a degree of unreserved confidence, so opposite to the caution and\r\ntimidity which had marked their previous movements, that nothing will\r\never persuade me that there was not rational and preconcerted\r\nco-operation throughout the whole party, and a degree of responsible\r\nauthority exercised by the patriarch leader.\r\n\r\n\"When the poor animals had gained possession of the tank (the leader\r\nbeing the last to enter), they seemed to abandon themselves to enjoyment\r\nwithout restraint or apprehension of danger. Such a mass of animal life\r\nI had never before seen huddled together in so narrow a space. It seemed\r\nto me as though they would have nearly drunk the tank dry. I watched\r\nthem with great interest until they had satisfied themselves as well in\r\nbathing as in drinking, when I tried how small a noise would apprise\r\nthem of the proximity of unwelcome neighbours. I had but to break a\r\nlittle twig, and the solid mass instantly took to flight like a herd of\r\nfrightened deer, each of the smaller calves being apparently shouldered\r\nand carried along between two of the older ones.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Letter from Major SKINNER.]\r\n\r\nIn drinking, the elephant, like the camel, although preferring water\r\npure, shows no decided aversion to it when discoloured with mud[1]; and\r\nthe eagerness with which he precipitates himself into the tanks and\r\nstreams attests his exquisite enjoyment of the fresh coolness, which to\r\nhim is the chief attraction. In crossing deep rivers, although his\r\nrotundity and buoyancy enable him to swim with a less immersion than\r\nother quadrupeds, he generally prefers to sink till no part of his huge\r\nbody is visible except the tip of his trunk, through which he breathes,\r\nmoving beneath the surface, and only now and then raising his head to\r\nlook that he is keeping the proper direction.[2] In the dry season the\r\nscanty streams which, during the rains, are sufficient to convert the\r\nrivers of the low country into torrents, often entirely disappear,\r\nleaving only broad expanses of dry sand, which they have swept down with\r\nthem from the hills. In this the elephants contrive to sink wells for\r\ntheir own use by scooping out the sand to the depth of four or five\r\nfeet, and leaving a hollow for the percolation of the spring. But as the\r\nweight of the elephant would force in the side if left perpendicular,\r\none approach is always formed with such a gradient that he can reach the\r\nwater with his trunk without disturbing the surrounding sand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This peculiarity was known in the middle ages, and PHILE,\r\nwriting in the fourteenth century, says, that such is his _preference_,\r\nfor muddy water that the elephant _stirs it_ before he drinks.\r\n\r\n[Greek:\r\n\r\n  \"Ydor de pineisynchythen prin anpinoi\r\n  To gar dieides akribos diaptuei.\"]\r\n\r\n         --PHILE _de Eleph_., i. 144.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A tame elephant, when taken by his keepers to be bathed,\r\nand to have his skin washed and rubbed, lies down on his side, pressing\r\nhis head to the bottom under water, with only the top of his trunk\r\nprotruded, to breathe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe, although the fact has not been authoritatively\r\nstated by naturalists, that the stomach of the elephant will be found to\r\ninclude a section analogous to that possessed by some of the ruminants,\r\ncalculated to contain a supply of water as a provision against\r\nemergencies. The fact of his being enabled to retain a quantity of water\r\nand discharge it at pleasure has been long known to every observer of\r\nthe habits of the animal; but the proboscis has always been supposed to\r\nbe \"his water-reservoir,\"[1] and the theory of an internal receptacle\r\nhas not been discussed. The truth is that the anatomy of the elephant is\r\neven yet but imperfectly understood[2], and, although some peculiarities\r\nof his stomach were observed at an early period, and even their\r\nconfiguration described, the function of the abnormal portion remained\r\nundetermined, and has been only recently conjectured. An elephant which\r\nbelonged to Louis XIV. died at Versailles in 1681 at the age of\r\nseventeen, and an account of its dissection was published in the\r\n_Mémoires pour servir à l'Histoire Naturelle_, under the authority of\r\nthe Academy of Sciences, in which the unusual appendages of the stomach\r\nare pointed out with sufficient particularity, but no suggestion is made\r\nas to their probable uses.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: BRODERIP'S _Zoological Recreations_, p. 259.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For observing the osteology of the elephant, materials are\r\nof course abundant in the indestructible remains of the animal: but the\r\nstudy of the intestines, and the dissection of the softer parts by\r\ncomparative anatomists in Europe, have been up to the present time beset\r\nby difficulties. These arise not alone from the rarity of subjects, but\r\neven in cases where elephants have died in these countries,\r\ndecomposition interposes, and before the thorough examination of so vast\r\na body can be satisfactorily completed, the great mass falls into\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\nThe principal English authorities are _An Anatomical Account of the\r\nElephant accidentally burnt in Dublin_, by A. MOLYNEUX, A.D. 1696; which\r\nis probably a reprint of a letter on the same subject in the library of\r\nTrinity College, Dublin, addressed by A. Moulin, to Sir William Petty,\r\nLond. 1682. There are also some papers communicated to Sir Hans Sloane,\r\nand afterwards published in the _Philosophical Transactions_ of the year\r\n1710, by Dr. P. BLAIR, who had an opportunity of dissecting an elephant\r\nwhich died at Dundee in 1708. The latter writer observes that,\r\n\"notwithstanding the vast interest attaching to the elephant in all\r\nages, yet has its body been hitherto very little subjected to\r\nanatomical, inquiries;\" and he laments that the rapid decomposition of\r\nthe carcase, and other causes, had interposed obstacles to the scrutiny\r\nof the subject he was so fortunate as to find access to.\r\n\r\nIn 1723 Dr. WM. STUCKLEY published _Some Anatomical Observations made\r\nupon the Dissection of an Elephant_; but each of the above essays is\r\nnecessarily unsatisfactory, and little has since been done to supply\r\ntheir defects. One of the latest and most valuable contributions to the\r\nsubjects, is a paper read before the Royal Irish Academy, on the 18th of\r\nFeb., 1847, by Professor HARRISON, who had the opportunity of dissecting\r\nan Indian elephant which died of acute fever; but the examination, so\r\nfar as he has made it public, extends only to the cranium, the brain,\r\nand the proboscis, the larynx, trachea, and oesophagus. An essential\r\nservice would be rendered to science if some sportsman in Ceylon, or\r\nsome of the officers connected with the elephant establishment there,\r\nwould take the trouble to forward the carcase of a young one to England\r\nin a state fit for dissection.\r\n\r\n_Postscriptum._--I am happy to say that a young elephant, carefully\r\npreserved in spirits, has recently been obtained in Ceylon, and\r\nforwarded to Prof. Owen, of the British Museum, by the joint exertions\r\nof M. DIARD and Major SKINNER. An opportunity has thus been afforded\r\nfrom which science will reap advantage, of devoting a patient attention\r\nto the internal structure of this interesting animal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The passage as quoted by BUFFON from the _Mémoires_ is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n--\"L'estomac avoit peu de diamètre; il en avoit moins que le colon, car\r\nson diamètre n'étoit que de quatorze pouces dans la partie la plus\r\nlarge; il avoit trois pieds et demi de longueur: l'orifice supérieur\r\nétoit à-peu-près aussi éloigné du pylore que du fond du grand cul-de-sac\r\nqui se terminoit en une pointe composée de tuniques beaucoup plus\r\népaisses que celles du reste de l'estomac; il y avoit au fond du grand\r\ncul-de-sac plusieurs feuillets épais d'une ligne, larges d'un pouce et\r\ndemi, et disposés irrégulierement; le reste de parois intérieures étoit\r\npercé de plusieurs petits trous et par de plus grands qui\r\ncorrespondoîent à des grains glanduleux.\"--BUFFON, _Hist. Nat_., vol.\r\nxi. p. 109.]\r\n\r\nA writer in the _Quarterly Review_ for December 1850, says that \"CAMPER\r\nand other comparative anatomists have shown that the left, or cardiac\r\nend of the stomach in the elephant is adapted, by several wide folds of\r\nlining membrane, to serve as a receiver for water;\" but this is scarcely\r\ncorrect, for although CAMPER has accurately figured the external form of\r\nthe stomach, he disposes of the question of the interior functions with\r\nthe simple remark that its folds \"semblent en faire une espèce de\r\ndivision particulière.\"[1] In like manner SIR EVERARD HOME, in his\r\n_Lectures on Comparative Anatomy_, has not only carefully described the\r\nform of the elephant's stomach, and furnished a drawing of it even more\r\naccurate than CAMPER; but he has equally omitted to assign any purpose\r\nto so strange a formation, contenting himself with observing that the\r\nstructure is a peculiarity, and that one of the remarkable folds nearest\r\nthe orifice of the diaphragm appears to act as a valve, so that the\r\nportion beyond may be considered as an appendage similar to that of the\r\nhog and the _peccary_.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"L'extrémité voisine du cardia se termine par une poche\r\ntrès-considérable et doublée à l'intérieure du quatorze valvules\r\norbiculaires que semblent en faire une espèce de division\r\nparticulière.\"--CAMPER, _Description Anatomique d'un Eléphant Mâle_, p.\r\n37, tabl. IX.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"The elephant has another peculiarity in the internal\r\nstructure of the stomach. It is longer and narrower than that of most\r\nanimals. The cuticular membrane of the oesophagus terminates at the\r\norifice of the stomach. At the cardiac end, which is very narrow and\r\npointed at the extremity, the lining is thick and glandular, and is\r\nthrown into transverse folds, of which five are broad and nine narrow.\r\nThat nearest the orifice of the oesophagus is the broadest, and appears\r\nto act occasionally as a valve, so that the part beyond may be\r\nconsidered as an appendage similar to that of the peccary and the hog.\r\nThe membrane of the cardiac portion is uniformly smooth; that of the\r\npyloric is thicker and more vascular.\"--_Lectures on Comparative\r\nAnatomy_, by Sir EVERARD HOME, Bart. 4to. Lond. vol. i. p. 155. The\r\nfigure of the elephant's stomach is given, in his _Lectures_, vol. ii.\r\nplate xviii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELEPANT'S STOMACH.]\r\n\r\nThe appendage thus alluded to by Sir EVERARD HOME is the grand\r\n\"cul-de-sac,\" noticed by the Académic des Sciences, and the \"division\r\nparticulière,\" figured by CAMPER. It is of sufficient dimensions to\r\ncontain ten gallons of water, and by means of the valve above alluded\r\nto, it can be shut off from the chamber devoted to the process of\r\ndigestion. Professor OWEN is probably the first who, not from an\r\nautopsy, but from the mere inspection of the drawings of CAMPER and\r\nHOME, ventured to assert (in lectures hitherto unpublished), that the\r\nuses of this section of the elephant's stomach may be analogous to those\r\nascertained to belong to a somewhat similar arrangement in the stomach\r\nof the camel, one cavity of which is exclusively employed as a reservoir\r\nfor water, and performs no function the preparation of food.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A similar arrangement, with some modifications, has more\r\nrecently been found in the llama of the Andes, which, like the camel, is\r\nused as a beast of burden in the Cordilleras of Chili and Peru; but both\r\nthese and the camel are _ruminants_, whilst the elephants belongs to the\r\nPachydermata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhilst Professor OWEN was advancing this conjecture, another comparative\r\nanatomist, from the examination of another portion of the structure of\r\nthe elephant, was led to a somewhat similar conclusion. Dr. HARRISON of\r\nDublin had, in 1847, an opportunity of dissecting the body of an\r\nelephant which had suddenly died; and in the course of his examination\r\nof the thoracic viscera, he observed that an unusually close connection\r\nexisted between the trachea and oesophagus, which he found to depend on\r\na muscle unnoticed by any previous anatomist, connecting the back of the\r\nformer with the forepart of the latter, along which the fibres descend\r\nand can be distinctly traced to the cardiac orifice of the stomach.\r\nImperfectly acquainted with the habits and functions of the elephant in\r\na state of nature, Dr. HARRISON found it difficult to pronounce as to\r\nthe use of this very peculiar structure; but looking to the intimate\r\nconnection between the mechanism concerned in the functions of\r\nrespiration and deglutition, and seeing that the proboscis served in a\r\ndouble capacity as an instrument of voice and an organ for the\r\nprehension of food, he ventured (apparently without adverting to the\r\nabnormal form of the stomach) to express the opinion that this muscle,\r\nviewing its attachment to the trachea, might either have some influence\r\nin raising the diaphragm, and thereby assisting in expiration, \"_or that\r\nit might raise the cardiac orifice of the stomach, and so aid this organ\r\nto regurgitate a portion of its contents into the oesophagus_.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Proceed. Roy. Irish Acad_., vol. iv. p. 133.]\r\n\r\nDr. HARRISON, on the reflection that \"we have no satisfactory evidence\r\nthat the animal ever ruminates,\" thought it useless to speculate on the\r\nlatter supposition as to the action of the newly discovered muscle, and\r\nrather inclined to the surmise that it was designed to assist the\r\nelephant in producing the remarkable sound through his proboscis known\r\nas \"trumpeting;\" but there is little room to doubt that of the two the\r\nrejected hypothesis was the more correct one. I have elsewhere described\r\nthe occurrence to which I was myself a witness[1], of elephants\r\ninserting their proboscis in their mouths, and withdrawing gallons of\r\nwater, which could only have been contained in the receptacle figured by\r\nCAMPER and HOME, and of which the true uses were discerned by the clear\r\nintellect of Professor OWEN. I was not, till very recently, aware that a\r\nsimilar observation as to the remarkable habit of the elephant, had been\r\nmade by the author of the _Ayeen Akbery_, in his account of the _Feel_\r\n_Kaneh_, or elephant stables of the Emperor Akbar, in which he says, \"an\r\nelephant frequently with his trunk takes water out of his stomach and\r\nsprinkles himself with it, and it is not in the least offensive.\"[2]\r\nFORBES, in his Oriental Memoirs, quotes this passage of the _Ayeen\r\nAkbery_, but without a remark; nor does any European writer with whose\r\nworks I am acquainted appear to have been cognisant of the peculiarity\r\nin question.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the account of an elephant corral, chap. vi.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ayeen Akbery_, transl. by GLADWIN, vol i. pt. i, p. 147.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATER-CELLS IN THE STOMACH OF THE CAMEL.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that Professor OWEN'S dissection of the young\r\nelephant, recently arrived, may serve to decide this highly interesting\r\npoint.[1] Should scientific investigation hereafter more clearly\r\nestablish the fact that, in this particular, the structure of the\r\nelephant is assimilated to that of the llama and the camel, it will be\r\nregarded as more than a common coincidence, that an apparatus, so unique\r\nin its purpose and action, should thus have been conferred by the\r\nCreator on the three animals which in sultry climates are, by this\r\narrangement, enabled to traverse arid regions in the service of man.[2]\r\nTo show this peculiar organization where it attains its fullest\r\ndevelopment, I have given a sketch of the water-cells, in the stomach of\r\nthe camel on the preceding page.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: One of the Indian names for the elephant is _duipa_, which\r\nsignifies \"to drink twice\" (AMANDI, p. 513). Can this have reference to\r\nthe peculiarity of the stomach for retaining a supply of water? Or has\r\nit merely reference to the habit of the animal to fill his trunk before\r\ntransferring the water to his mouth.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The buffalo and the humped cattle of India, which are used\r\nfor draught and burden, have, I believe, a development of the\r\norganisation of the reticulum which enables the ruminants generally, to\r\nendure thirst, and abstain from water, somewhat more conspicuous than in\r\nthe rest of their congeners; but nothing that approaches in singularity\r\nof character to the distinct cavities in the stomach exhibited by the\r\nthree animals above alluded to.]\r\n\r\nThe _food_ of the elephant is so abundant, that in feeding he never\r\nappears to be impatient or voracious, but rather to play with the leaves\r\nand branches on which he leisurely feeds. In riding by places where a\r\nherd has recently halted, I have sometimes seen the bark peeled\r\ncuriously off the twigs, as though it had been done in mere dalliance.\r\nIn the same way in eating grass the elephant selects a tussac which he\r\ndraws from the ground by a dexterous twist of his trunk, and nothing can\r\nbe more graceful than the ease with which, before conveying it to his\r\nmouth, he beats the earth from its roots by striking it gently upon his\r\nfore-leg. A coco-nut he first rolls under foot, to detach the strong\r\nouter bark, then stripping off with his trunk the thick layer of fibre\r\nwithin, he places the shell in his mouth, and swallows with evident\r\nrelish the fresh liquid which flows as he crushes it between his\r\ngrinders.\r\n\r\nThe natives of the peninsula of Jaffna always look for the periodical\r\nappearance of the elephants, at the precise time when the fruit of the\r\npalmyra palm begins to fall to the ground from ripeness. In like manner\r\nin the eastern provinces where the custom prevails of cultivating what\r\nis called _chena_ land (by clearing a patch of forest for the purpose of\r\nraising a single crop, after which the ground is abandoned, and reverts\r\nto jungle again), although a single elephant may not have been seen in\r\nthe neighbourhood during the early stages of the process, the Moormen,\r\nwho are the cultivators of this class, will predict their appearance\r\nwith almost unerring confidence so soon as the grains shall have begun\r\nto ripen; and although the crop comes to maturity at different periods\r\nin different districts, herds are certain to be seen at each in\r\nsuccession, as soon as it is ready to be cut. In these well-timed\r\nexcursions, they resemble the bison of North America, which, by a\r\nsimilarly mysterious instinct, finds its way to portions of the distant\r\nprairies, where accidental fires have been followed by a growth of\r\ntender grass. Although the fences around these _chenas_ are little more\r\nthan lines of reeds loosely fastened together, they are sufficient, with\r\nthe presence of a single watcher, to prevent the entrance of the\r\nelephants, who wait patiently till the rice and _coracan_ have been\r\nremoved, and the watcher withdrawn; and, then finding gaps in the fence,\r\nthey may be seen gleaning among the leavings and the stubble; and they\r\ntake their departure when these are exhausted, apparently in the\r\ndirection of some other _chena_, which they have ascertained to be about\r\nto be cut.\r\n\r\nThere is something still unexplained in the dread which an elephant\r\nalways exhibits on approaching a fence, and the reluctance which he\r\ndisplays to face the slightest artificial obstruction to his passage. In\r\nthe fine old tank of Tissa-weva, close by Anarajapoora, the natives\r\ncultivate grain, during the dry season, around the margin where the\r\nground has been left bare by the subsidence of the water. These little\r\npatches of rice they enclose with small sticks an inch in diameter and\r\nfive or six feet in height, such as would scarcely serve to keep out a\r\nwild hog if he attempted to force his way through. Passages of from ten\r\nto twenty feet wide are left between each field, to permit the wild\r\nelephants, which abound in the vicinity to make their nocturnal visits\r\nto the water still remaining in the tank. Night after night these open\r\npathways are frequented by immense herds, but the tempting corn is never\r\ntouched, nor is a single fence disturbed, although the merest, movement\r\nof a trunk would be sufficient to demolish the fragile structure. Yet\r\nthe same spots, the fences being left open as soon as the grain has been\r\ncut and carried home, are eagerly entered by the elephants to glean\r\namongst the stubble.\r\n\r\nSportsmen observe that an elephant, even when enraged by a wound, will\r\nhesitate to charge an assailant across an intervening hedge, but will\r\nhurry along it to seek for an opening. It is possible that, on the part\r\nof the elephant, there may be some instinctive consciousness, that owing\r\nto his superior bulk, he is exposed to danger from sources that might be\r\nperfectly harmless in the case of lighter animals, and hence his\r\nsuspicion that every fence may conceal a snare or pitfall. Some similar\r\napprehension is apparent in the deer, which shrinks from attempting a\r\nfence of wire, although it will clear without hesitation a solid wall of\r\ngreater height.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the caution with which the elephant is supposed to\r\napproach insecure ground and places of doubtful[1] solidity, appears to\r\nme, so far as my own observation and experience extend, to be\r\nexaggerated, and the number of temporary bridges which are annually\r\nbroken down by elephants in all parts of Ceylon, is sufficient to show\r\nthat, although in captivity, and when familiar with such structures, the\r\ntame ones may, and doubtless do, exhibit all the wariness attributed to\r\nthem; yet, in a state of liberty, and whilst unaccustomed to such\r\nartificial appliances, their instincts are not sufficient to ensure\r\ntheir safety. Besides, the fact is adverted to elsewhere[2], that the\r\nchiefs of the Wanny, during the sovereignty of the Dutch, were\r\naccustomed to take in pitfalls the elephants which they rendered as\r\ntribute to government.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"One of the strongest instincts which the elephant\r\npossesses, is this which impels him to experiment upon the solidity of\r\nevery surface which he is required to cross.\"--_Menageries, &c._ \"The\r\nElephant,\" vol. i. pp. 17, 19, 66.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: WOLF'S _Life and Adventures_, p. 151. See p. 115, _note_.]\r\n\r\nA fact illustrative at once of the caution and the spirit of curiosity\r\nwith which an elephant regards an unaccustomed object has been\r\nfrequently mentioned to me by the officers engaged in opening roads\r\nthrough the forest. On such occasions the wooden \"tracing pegs\" which\r\nthey are obliged to drive into the ground to mark the levels taken\r\nduring the day, will often be withdrawn by the elephants during the\r\nnight, to such an extent as frequently to render it necessary to go over\r\nthe work a second time, in order to replace them.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Private Letter_ from Dr. DAVY, author of _An Account of\r\nthe Interior of Ceylon_.]\r\n\r\nColonel HARDY, formerly Deputy Quarter-Master-General in Ceylon, when\r\nproceeding, about the year 1820, to a military out-post in the\r\nsouth-east of the island, imprudently landed in an uninhabited part of\r\nthe coast, intending to take a short cut through the forest, to his\r\ndestination. He not only miscalculated the distance, but, on the\r\napproach of nightfall, he was chased by a vicious rogue elephant. The\r\npursuer was nearly upon him, when, to gain time, he flung down a small\r\ndressing-case, which he happened to be carrying. The device was\r\nsuccessful; the elephant halted and minutely examined its contents, and\r\nthus gave the colonel time to effect his escape.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Colombo Observer_ for March 1858, contains an offer of\r\na reward of twenty-five guineas for the destruction of an elephant which\r\ninfested the Rajawallé coffee plantation, in the vicinity of Kandy. Its\r\nobject seemed to be less the search for food, than the satisfying of its\r\ncuriosity and the gratification of its passion for mischief. Mr. TYTLER,\r\nthe proprietor, states that it frequented the jungle near the estate,\r\nwhence it was its custom to sally forth at night for the pleasure of\r\npulling down buildings and trees, \"and it seemed to have taken a spite\r\nat the pipes of the water-works, the pillars of which it several times\r\nbroke down--its latest fancy being to wrench off the taps.\" This\r\nelephant has since been shot.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the general sagacity of the elephant, although it has not\r\nbeen over-rated in the instances of those whose powers have been largely\r\ndeveloped in captivity, an undue estimate has been formed in relation to\r\nthem whilst still untamed. The difference of instincts and habits\r\nrenders it difficult to institute a just comparison between them and\r\nother animals. CUVIER[1] is disposed to ascribe the exalted idea that\r\nprevails of their intellect to the feats which an elephant performs with\r\nthat unique instrument, its trunk, combined with an imposing expression\r\nof countenance: but he records his own conviction that in sagacity it in\r\nno way excels the dog, and some other species of Carnivora. If there be\r\na superiority, I am disposed to award it to the dog, not from any excess\r\nof natural capacity, but from the higher degree of development\r\nconsequent on his more intimate domestication and association with man.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: CUVIER, _Règne Animal_. \"Les Mammiferes,\" p. 280.]\r\n\r\nOne remarkable fact was called to my attention by a gentleman who\r\nresided on a coffee plantation at Rassawé, one of the loftiest mountains\r\nof the Ambogammoa range. More than once during the terrific\r\nthunder-bursts that precede the rains at the change of each monsoon, he\r\nobserved that the elephants in the adjoining forest hastened from under\r\ncover of the trees and took up their station in the open ground, where I\r\nsaw them on one of these occasions collected into a group; and here, he\r\nsaid, it was their custom to remain till the lightning had ceased, when\r\nthey retired again into the jungle.[1] It must be observed, however,\r\nthat showers, and especially light drizzling rain, are believed to bring\r\nthe elephants from the jungle towards pathways or other openings in the\r\nforest;--and hence, in places infested by them, timid persons are afraid\r\nto travel in the afternoon during uncertain weather.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The elephant is believed by the Singhalese to express his\r\nuneasiness by his voice, on the approach of _rain_; and the Tamils have\r\na proverb.--\"_Listen to the elephant, rain is coming._\"]\r\n\r\nWhen free in its native woods the elephant evinces rather simplicity\r\nthan sagacity, and its intelligence seldom exhibits itself in cunning.\r\nThe rich profusion in which nature has supplied its food, and\r\nanticipated its every want, has made it independent of those devices by\r\nwhich carnivorous animals provide for their subsistence; and, from the\r\nabsence of all rivalry between it and the other denizens of the plains,\r\nit is never required to resort to artifice for self-protection. For\r\nthese reasons, in its tranquil and harmless life, it may appear to\r\ncasual observers to exhibit even less than ordinary ability; but when\r\ndanger and apprehension call for the exertion of its powers, those who\r\nhave witnessed their display are seldom inclined to undervalue its\r\nsagacity.\r\n\r\nMr. CRIPPS has related to me an instance in which a recently captured\r\nelephant was either rendered senseless from fear, or, as the native\r\nattendants asserted, _feigned death_ in order to regain its freedom. It\r\nwas led from the corral as usual between two tame ones, and had already\r\nproceeded far towards its destination; when night closing in, and the\r\ntorches being lighted, it refused to go on, and finally sank to the\r\nground, apparently lifeless. Mr. CRIPPS ordered the fastenings to be\r\nremoved from its legs, and when all attempts to raise it had failed, so\r\nconvinced was he that it was dead, that he ordered the ropes to be taken\r\noff and the carcase abandoned. While this was being done he and a\r\ngentleman by whom he was accompanied leaned against the body to rest.\r\nThey had scarcely taken their departure and proceeded a few yards, when,\r\nto their astonishment, the elephant rose with the utmost alacrity, and\r\nfled towards the jungle, screaming at the top of its voice, its cries\r\nbeing audible long after it had disappeared in the shades of the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNARRATIVES OF THE NATIVES OF CEYLON RELATIVE TO ENCOUNTERS WITH ROGUE\r\nELEPHANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following narratives have been taken down by a Singhalese gentleman,\r\nfrom the statements of the natives by whom they are recounted;--and they\r\nare here inserted, in order to show the opinion prevalent amongst the\r\npeople of Ceylon as to the habits and propensities of the rogue\r\nelephant. The stories are given in words of my correspondent, who writes\r\nin English, as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. \"We,\" said my informant, who was a native trader of Caltura, \"were on\r\nour way to Badulla, by way of Ratnapoora and Balangodde, to barter our\r\nmerchandize for coffee. There were six in our party, myself, my\r\nbrother-in-law, and four coolies, who carried on pingoes[1] our\r\nmerchandize, which consisted of cloth and brass articles. About 4\r\no'clock, P.M., we were close to Idalgasinna, and our coolies were rather\r\nunwilling to go further for fear of elephants, which they said were sure\r\nto be met with at that noted place, especially as there had been a\r\nslight drizzling of rain during the whole afternoon. I was as much\r\nafraid of elephants as the coolies themselves; but I was anxious to\r\nproceed, and so, after a few words of encouragement addressed to them,\r\nand a prayer or two offered up to _Saman dewiyo_[2], we resumed our\r\njourney. I also took the further precaution of hanging up a few\r\nleaves.[3] As the rain was coming down fast and thick, and I was anxious\r\nto get to our halting-place before night, we moved on at a rapid pace.\r\nMy brother-in-law was in the van of the party, I myself was in the rear,\r\nand the four coolies between us, all moving along on a rugged, rocky,\r\nand difficult path; as the road to Badulla till lately was on the\r\nsloping side of a hill, covered with jungle, pieces of projecting rock,\r\nand brushwood. It was about five o'clock in the evening, or a little\r\nlater, and we had hardly cleared the foot of the hill and got to the\r\nplain below, when a rustling of leaves and a crackling of dry brushwood\r\nwere heard on our right, followed immediately by the trumpeting of a\r\n_hora allia_[4], which was making towards us. We all fled, followed by\r\nthe elephant. I, who was in the rear of the party, was the first to take\r\nto flight; the coolies threw away their pingoes, and my brother-in-law\r\nhis umbrella, and all ran in different directions. I hid myself behind a\r\nlarge boulder of granite nearly covered by jungle: but as my place of\r\nconcealment was on high ground, I could see all that was going on below.\r\nThe first thing I observed was the elephant returning to the place where\r\none of the pingoes was lying: he was carrying one of the coolies in a\r\ncoil of his trunk. The body of the man was dangling with the head\r\ndownward. I cannot say whether he was then alive or not; I could not\r\nperceive any marks of blood or bruises on his person: but he appeared to\r\nbe lifeless. The elephant placed him down on the ground, put the pingo\r\non his (the man's) shoulder, steadying both the man and the pingo with\r\nhis trunk and fore-legs. But the man of course did not move or stand up\r\nwith his pingo. Seeing this, the elephant again raised the cooly and\r\ndashed him against the ground, and then trampled the body to a very\r\njelly. This done, he took up the pingo and moved away from the spot; but\r\nat the distance of about a fathom or two, laid it down again, and\r\nripping open one of the bundles, took out of it all the contents,\r\n_somans_[5], _camb[=a]yas_[6], handkerchiefs, and several pieces of\r\nwhite cambrick cloth, all which he tore to small pieces, and flung them\r\nwildly here and there. He did the same with all the other pingoes. When\r\nthis was over the elephant quietly walked away into the jungle,\r\ntrumpeting all the way as far as I could hear. When danger was past I\r\ncame out of my concealment, and returned to the place where we had\r\nhalted that morning. Here the rest of my companions joined me soon\r\nafter. The next morning we set out again on our journey, our party being\r\nnow increased by some seven or eight traders from Salpity Corle: but\r\nthis time we did not meet with the elephant. We found the mangled corpse\r\nof our cooly on the same spot where I had seen it the day before,\r\ntogether with the torn pieces of my cloths, of which we collected as\r\nfast as we could the few which were serviceable, and all the brass\r\nutensils which were quite uninjured. That elephant was a noted rogue. He\r\nhad before this killed many people on that road, especially those\r\ncarrying pingoes of coco-nut oil and ghee. He was afterwards killed by\r\nan Englishman. The incidents I have mentioned above, took place about\r\ntwenty years ago.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Yokes borne on the shoulder, with a package at each end.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The tutelary spirit of the sacred mountain, Adam's Peak.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The Singhalese hold the belief, that twigs taken from one\r\nbush and placed on another growing close to a pathway, ensure protection\r\nto travellers from the attacks of wild animals, and especially of\r\nelephants. Can it be that the latter avoid the path, on discovering this\r\nevidence of the proximity of recent passengers?]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: A rogue elephant.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Woman's robe.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The figured cloth worn by men.]\r\n\r\nThe following also relates to the same locality. It was narrated to me\r\nby an old Moorman of Barberyn, who, during his earlier years, led the\r\nlife of a pedlar.\r\n\r\n2. \"I and another,\" said he, \"were on our way to Badulla, one day some\r\ntwenty-five or thirty years ago. We were quietly moving along a path\r\nwhich wound round a hill, when all of a sudden, and without the\r\nslightest previous intimation either by the rustling of leaves or by any\r\nother sign, a huge elephant with short tusks rushed to the path. Where\r\nhe had been before I can't say; I believe he must have been lying in\r\nwait for travellers. In a moment he rushed forward to the road,\r\ntrumpeting dreadfully, and seized my companion. I, who happened to be in\r\nthe rear, took to flight, pursued by the elephant, which had already\r\nkilled my companion by striking him against the ground. I had not moved\r\nmore than seven or eight fathoms, when the elephant seized me, and threw\r\nme up with such force, that I was carried high into the air towards a\r\n_Cahata_ tree, whose branches caught me and prevented my falling to the\r\nground. By this I received no other injury than the dislocation of one\r\nof my wrists. I do not know whether the elephant saw me after he had\r\nhurled me away through the air; but certainly he did not come to the\r\ntree to which I was then clinging: even if he had come, he couldn't have\r\ndone me any more harm, as the branch on which I was far beyond the reach\r\nof his trunk, and the tree itself too large for him to pull down. The\r\nnext thing I saw was the elephant returning to the corpse of my\r\ncompanion, which he again threw on the ground, and placing one of his\r\nfore feet on it, he tore it with his trunk limb after limb; and dabbled\r\nin the blood that flowed from the shapeless mass of flesh which he was\r\nstill holding under his foot.\"\r\n\r\n3. \"In 1847 or '46,\" said another informant, \"I was a superintendent of\r\na coco-nut estate belonging to Mr. Armitage, situated about twelve miles\r\nfrom Negombo. A rogue elephant did considerable injury to the estate at\r\nthat time; and one day, hearing that it was then on the plantation, a\r\nMr. Lindsay, an Englishman, who was proprietor of the adjoining\r\nproperty, and myself, accompanied by some seven or eight people of the\r\nneighbouring village, went out, carrying with us six rifles loaded and\r\nprimed. We continued to walk along a path which, near one of its turns,\r\nhad some bushes on one side. We had calculated to come up with the brute\r\nwhere it had been seen half an hour before; but no sooner had one of our\r\nmen, who was walking foremost, seen the animal at the distance of some\r\nfifteen or twenty fathoms, than he exclaimed, 'There! there!' and\r\nimmediately took to his heels, and we all followed his example. The\r\nelephant did not see us until we had run some fifteen or twenty paces\r\nfrom the spot where we turned, when he gave us chase, screaming\r\nfrightfully as he came on. The Englishman managed to climb a tree, and\r\nthe rest of my companions did the same; as for myself I could not,\r\nalthough I made one or two superhuman efforts. But there was no time to\r\nbe lost. The elephant was running at me with his trunk bent down in a\r\ncurve towards the ground. At this critical moment Mr. Lindsay held out\r\nhis foot to me, with the help of which and then of the branches of the\r\ntree, which were three or four feet above my head, I managed to scramble\r\nup to a branch. The elephant came directly to the tree and attempted to\r\nforce it down, which he could not. He first coiled his trunk round the\r\nstem, and pulled it with all his might, but with no effect. He then\r\napplied his head to the tree, and pushed for several minutes, but with\r\nno better success. He then trampled with his feet all the projecting\r\nroots, moving, as he did so, several times round and round the tree.\r\nLastly, failing in all this, and seeing a pile of timber, which I had\r\nlately cut, at a short distance from us, he removed it all (thirty-six\r\npieces) one at a time to the root of the tree, and piled them up in a\r\nregular business-like manner; then placing his hind feet on this pile,\r\nhe raised the fore part of his body, and reached out his trunk, but\r\nstill he could not touch us, as we were too far above him. The\r\nEnglishman then fired, and the ball took effect somewhere on the\r\nelephant's head, but did not kill him. It made him only the more\r\nfurious. The next shot, however, levelled him to the ground. I\r\nafterwards brought the skull of the animal to Colombo, and it is still\r\nto be seen at the house of Mr. Armitage.\"\r\n\r\n4. \"One night a herd of elephants entered a village in the Four Corles.\r\nAfter doing considerable injury to plaintain bushes and young coco-nut\r\ntrees, they retired, the villagers being unable to do anything to\r\nprotect their fruit trees from destruction. But one elephant was left\r\nbehind, who continued to scream the whole night through at the same\r\nspot. It was then discovered that the elephant, on seeing a jak fruit on\r\na tree somewhat beyond the reach of his trunk, had raised himself on his\r\nhind legs, placing his fore feet against the stem, in order to lay hold\r\nof the fruit, but unluckily for him there happened to be another tree\r\nstanding so close to it that the vacant space between the two stems was\r\nonly a few inches. During his attempts to take hold of the fruit one of\r\nhis legs happened to get in between the two trees, where, on account of\r\nhis weight and his clumsy attempts to extricate himself, it got so\r\nfirmly wedged that he could not remove it, and in this awkward position\r\nhe remained for some days, till he died on the spot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Elephant Shooting._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the shooting of an elephant, whatever endurance and adroitness the\r\nsport may display in other respects, requires the smallest possible\r\nskill as a marksman, the numbers which are annually slain in this way\r\nmay be regarded as evidence of the multitudes abounding in those parts\r\nof Ceylon to which they resort. One officer, Major ROGERS, killed\r\nupwards of 1400; another, Captain GALLWEY, has the credit of slaying\r\nmore than half that number; Major SKINNER, the Commissioner of Roads,\r\nalmost as many; and less persevering aspirants follow at humbler\r\ndistances.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: To persons like myself, who are not addicted to what is\r\ncalled \"sport,\" the statement of these wholesale slaughters is\r\ncalculated to excite surprise and curiosity as to the nature of a\r\npassion that impels men to self-exposure and privation, in a pursuit\r\nwhich presents nothing but the monotonous recurrence of scenes of blood\r\nand suffering. Mr. BAKER, who has recently published, under the title of\r\n\"_The Rifle and the Hound in Ceylon_\" an account of his exploits in the\r\nforest, gives us the assurance that \"_all real sportsmen are\r\ntender-hearted men, who shun cruelty to an animal, and are easily moved\r\nby a tale of distress_;\" and that although man is naturally\r\nbloodthirsty, and a beast of prey by instinct, yet that the true\r\nsportsman is distinguished from the rest of the human race by his \"_love\r\nof nature, and of noble scenery_.\" In support of this pretension to a\r\ngentler nature than the rest of mankind, the author proceeds to attest\r\nhis own abhorrence of cruelty by narrating the sufferings of an old\r\nhound, which, although \"toothless,\" he cheered on to assail a boar at\r\nbay, but the poor dog recoiled \"covered with blood, cut nearly in half,\r\nwith a wound fourteen inches in length, from the lower part of the\r\nbelly, passing up the flank, completely severing the muscles of the hind\r\nleg, and extending up the spine; his hind leg having the appearance of\r\nbeing nearly off.\" In this state, forgetful of the character he had so\r\nlately given of the true sportsman, as a lover of nature and a hater of\r\ncruelty, he encouraged \"the poor old dog,\" as he calls him, to resume\r\nthe fight with the boar, which lasted for an hour, when he managed to\r\ncall the dogs off; and perfectly exhausted, the mangled hound crawled\r\nout of the jungle with several additional wounds, including a severe\r\ngash in his throat. \"He fell from exhaustion, and we made a litter with\r\ntwo poles and a horsecloth to carry him home.\"--P. 314. If such were the\r\nhabitual enjoyments of this class of sportsmen, their motiveless\r\nmassacres would admit of no manly justification. In comparison with them\r\none is disposed to regard almost with favour the exploits of a hunter\r\nlike Major ROGERS, who is said to have applied the value of the ivory\r\nobtained from his encounters towards the purchase of his successive\r\nregimental commissions, and had, therefore, an object, however\r\ndisproportionate, in his slaughter of 1400 elephants.\r\n\r\nOne gentleman in Ceylon, not less distinguished for his genuine kindness\r\nof heart, than for his marvellous success in shooting elephants, avowed\r\nto me that the eagerness with which he found himself impelled to pursue\r\nthem had often excited surprise in his own mind; and although he had\r\nnever read the theory of Lord Kames, or the speculations of Vicesimus\r\nKnox, he had come to the conclusion that the passion thus excited within\r\nhim was a remnant of the hunter's instinct, with which man was\r\noriginally endowed, to enable him, by the chase, to support existence in\r\na state of nature, and which, though rendered dormant by civilisation,\r\nhad not been utterly eradicated.\r\n\r\nThis theory is at least more consistent and intelligible than the \"love\r\nof nature and scenery,\" sentimentally propounded by the author quoted\r\nabove.]\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding this prodigious destruction, a reward of a few\r\nshillings per head offered by the Government for taking elephants was\r\nclaimed for 3500 destroyed in part of the northern province alone, in\r\nless than three years prior to 1848: and between 1851 and 1856, a\r\nsimilar reward was paid for 2000 in the southern province, between Galle\r\nand Hambangtotte.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is little opportunity for the display of marksmanship in\r\nan elephant battue, there is one feature in the sport, as conducted in\r\nCeylon, which contrasts favourably with the slaughterhouse details\r\nchronicled with revolting minuteness in some recent accounts of elephant\r\nshooting in South Africa. The practice in Ceylon is to aim invariably at\r\nthe head, and the sportsman finds his safety to consist in boldly facing\r\nthe animal, advancing to within fifteen paces, and lodging a bullet,\r\neither in the temple or in the hollow over the eye, or in a well-known\r\nspot immediately above the trunk, where the weaker structure of the\r\nskull affords an easy access to the brain.[1] The region of the ear is\r\nalso a fatal spot, and often resorted to,--the places I have mentioned\r\nin the front of the head being only accessible when the animal is\r\n\"charging.\" Professor HARRISON, in his communication to the Royal Irish\r\nAcademy on the Anatomy of the Elephant, has rendered an intelligible\r\nexplanation of this in the following passage descriptive of the\r\ncranium:--\"it exhibits two remarkable facts: _first_, the small space\r\noccupied by the brain; and, _secondly_, the beautiful and curious\r\nstructure of the bones of the head. The two tables of all these bones,\r\nexcept the occipital, are separated by rows of large cells, some from\r\nfour to five inches in length, others only small, irregular, and\r\nhoney-comb-like:--these all communicate with each other, and, through\r\nthe frontal sinuses, with the cavity of the nose, and also with the\r\ntympanum or drum of each ear; consequently, as in some birds, these\r\ncells are filled with air, and thus while the skull attains a great size\r\nin order to afford an extensive surface for the attachment of muscles,\r\nand a mechanical support for the tusks, it is at the same time very\r\nlight and buoyant in proportion to its bulk; a property the more\r\nvaluable as the animal is fond of water and bathes in deep rivers.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The vulnerability of the elephant in this region of the\r\nhead was known to the ancients, and PLINY, describing a combat of\r\nelephants in the amphitheatre at Rome, says, that one was slain by a\r\nsingle blow, \"pilum sub oculo adactum, in vitalia capitis venerat\" (Lib.\r\nviii. c. 7.) Notwithstanding the comparative facility of access to the\r\nbrain afforded at this spot, an ordinary leaden bullet is not certain to\r\npenetrate, and frequently becomes flattened. The hunters, to counteract\r\nthis, are accustomed to harden the ball, by the introduction of a small\r\nportion of type-metal along with the lead.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF ELEPHANT'S HEAD.]\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, a single ball, planted in the forehead, ends the\r\nexistence of the noble creature instantaneously: and expert sportsmen\r\nhave been known to kill right and left, one with each barrel; but\r\noccasionally an elephant will not fall before several shots have been\r\nlodged in his head.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"There is a wide difference of opinion as to the most\r\ndeadly shot. I think the temple the most certain, but authority in\r\nCeylon says the 'fronter,' that is, above the trunk. Behind the ear is\r\nsaid to be deadly, but that is a shot which I never fired or saw fired\r\nthat I remember. If the ball go true to its mark, all shots (in the\r\nhead) are certain; but the bones on either side of the honey-comb\r\npassage to the brain are so thick that there is in all a 'glorious\r\nuncertainty' which keeps a man on the _qui vive_ till he sees the\r\nelephant down.\"--From a paper on _Elephant Shooting in Ceylon_, by Major\r\nMACREADY, late Military Secretary at Colombo.]\r\n\r\nContrasted with this, one reads with a shudder the sickening details of\r\nthe African huntsman approaching _behind_ the retiring animal, and of\r\nthe torture inflicted by the shower of bullets which tear up its flesh\r\nand lacerate its flank and shoulders.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In Mr. GORDON CUMMING'S account of a _Hunter's Life in\r\nSouth Africa_, there is a narrative of his pursuit of a wounded elephant\r\nwhich he had lamed by lodging a ball in its shoulder-blade. It limped\r\nslowly towards a tree, against which it leaned itself in helpless agony,\r\nwhilst its pursuer seated himself in front of it, in safety, to _boil\r\nhis coffee_, and observe its sufferings. The story is continued as\r\nfollows:--\"Having admired him for a considerable time, _I resolved to\r\nmake experiments on vulnerable points_; and approaching very near I\r\nfired several bullets at different parts of his enormous skull. He only\r\nacknowledged the shots by a salaam-like movement of his trunk, with the\r\npoint of which he gently touched the wounds with a striking and peculiar\r\naction. Surprised and shocked at finding that I was only prolonging the\r\nsufferings of the noble beast, which bore its trials with such dignified\r\ncomposure, I resolved to finish the proceeding with all possible\r\ndespatch, and accordingly opened fire upon him from the left side,\r\naiming at the shoulder. I first fired _six_ shots with the two-grooved\r\nrifle, which must have eventually proved mortal. After which I fired\r\n_six_ shots at the same part with the Dutch six-pounder. _Large tears\r\nnow trickled from his eyes, which he slowly shut and opened, his\r\ncolossal frame shivered convulsively, and falling on his side, he\r\nexpired_.\" (Vol. ii. p. 10.)\r\n\r\nIn another place, after detailing the manner in which he assailed a poor\r\nanimal--he says, \"I was loading and firing as fast as could be,\r\nsometimes at the head, sometimes behind the shoulder, until my\r\nelephant's fore-quarter was a mass of gore; notwithstanding which he\r\ncontinued to hold on, leaving the grass and branches of the forest\r\nscarlet in his wake. * * * Having fired _thirty-five rounds_ with my\r\ntwo-grooved rifle, I opened upon him with the Dutch six-pounder, and\r\nwhen forty bullets had perforated his hide, he began for the first time,\r\nto evince signs of a dilapidated constitution.\" The disgusting\r\ndescription is closed thus: \"Throughout the charge he repeatedly cooled\r\nhis person with large quantities of water, which he ejected from his\r\ntrunk over his sides and back, and just as the pangs of death came over\r\nhim, he stood trembling violently beside a thorn tree, and kept pouring\r\nwater into his bloody mouth until he died, when he pitched heavily\r\nforward with the whole weight of his fore-quarters resting on the points\r\nof his tusks. The strain was fair, and the tusks did not yield; but the\r\nportion of his head in which the tusks were embedded, extending a long\r\nway above the eye, yielded and burst with a muffled crash.\"--(_Ib_.,\r\nvol. ii. pp. 4, 5.)]\r\n\r\nThe shooting of elephants in Ceylon has been described with tiresome\r\niteration in the successive journals of sporting gentlemen, but one who\r\nturns to their pages for traits of the animal and his instincts is\r\ndisappointed to find little beyond graphic sketches of the daring and\r\nexploits of his pursuers, most of whom, having had no further\r\nopportunity of observation than is derived from a casual encounter with\r\nthe outraged animal, have apparently tried to exalt their own prowess,\r\nby misrepresenting the ordinary character of the elephant, describing\r\nhim as \"savage, wary, and revengeful.\"[1]\r\n\r\nThese epithets may undoubtedly apply to the outcasts from the herd, the\r\n\"Rogues\" or _hora allia_, but so small is the proportion of these that\r\nthere is not probably one _rogue_ to be found for every five hundred of\r\nthose in herds; and it is a manifest error, arising from imperfect\r\ninformation, to extend this censure to them generally, or to suppose the\r\nelephant to be an animal \"thirsting for blood, lying in wait in the\r\njungle to rush on the unwary passer-by, and knowing no greater pleasure\r\nthan the act of crushing his victim to a shapeless mass beneath his\r\nfeet.\"[2] The cruelties practised by the hunters have no doubt taught\r\nthese sagacious creatures to be cautious and alert, but their\r\nprecautions are simply defensive; and beyond the alarm and apprehension\r\nwhich they evince on the approach of man, they exhibit no indication of\r\nhostility or thirst for blood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _The Rifle and the Hound in Ceylon_; by S.W. BAKER, Esq.,\r\npp. 8, 9. \"Next to a rogue,\" says Mr. BAKER, \"in ferocity, and even more\r\npersevering in the pursuit of her victim, is a female elephant.\" But he\r\nappends the significant qualification, \"_when her young one has been\r\nkilled_.\"--_Ibid_., p. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_.]\r\n\r\nAn ordinary traveller seldom comes upon elephants unless after sunset or\r\ntowards daybreak, as they go to or return from their nightly visits to\r\nthe tanks: but when by accident a herd is disturbed by day, they evince,\r\nif unattacked, no disposition to become assailants; and if the attitude\r\nof defence which they instinctively assume prove sufficent to check the\r\napproach of the intruder, no further demonstration is to be apprehended.\r\n\r\nEven the hunters who go in search of them find them in positions and\r\noccupations altogether inconsistent with the idea of their being savage,\r\nwary, or revengeful. Their demeanour when undisturbed is indicative of\r\ngentleness and timidity, and their actions bespeak lassitude and\r\nindolence, induced not alone by heat, but probably ascribable in some\r\ndegree to the fact that the night has been spent in watchfulness and\r\namusement. A few are generally browsing listlessly on the trees and\r\nplants within reach, others fanning themselves with leafy branches, and\r\na few are asleep; whilst the young run playfully among the herd, the\r\nemblems of innocence, as the older ones are of peacefulness and gravity.\r\n\r\nAlmost every elephant may be observed to exhibit some peculiar action of\r\nthe limbs when standing at rest; some move the head monotonously in a\r\ncircle, or from right to left; some swing their feet back and forward;\r\nothers flap their ears or sway themselves from side to side, or rise and\r\nsink by alternately bending and straightening the fore knees. As the\r\nopportunities of observing this custom have been almost confined to\r\nelephants in captivity, it has been conjectured to arise from some\r\nmorbid habit contracted during the length of a voyage by sea[1], or from\r\nan instinctive impulse to substitute a motion of this kind in lieu of\r\ntheir wonted exercise; but this supposition is erroneous; the propensity\r\nbeing equally displayed by those at liberty and those in captivity. When\r\nsurprised by sportsmen in the depths of the jungle, individuals of a\r\nherd are always occupied in swinging their limbs in this manner; and in\r\nthe several corrals which I have seen, where whole herds have been\r\ncaptured, the elephants in the midst of the utmost excitement, and even\r\nafter the most vigorous charges, if they halted for a moment in stupor\r\nand exhaustion, manifested their wonted habit, and swung their limbs or\r\nswayed their bodies to and fro incessantly. So far from its being a\r\nsubstitute for exercise, those in the government employment in Ceylon\r\nare observed to practise their acquired motion, whatever it may be, with\r\nincreased vigour when thoroughly fatigued after excessive work. Even the\r\nfavourite practice of fanning themselves with a leafy branch seems less\r\nan enjoyment in itself than a resource when listless and at rest. The\r\nterm \"fidgetty\" seems to describe appropriately the temperament of the\r\nelephant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Menageries_, &c., \"The Elephant,\" ch. i. p. 21.]\r\n\r\nThey evince the strongest love of retirement and a corresponding dislike\r\nto intrusion. The approach of a stranger is perceived less by the eye,\r\nthe quickness of which is not remarkable (besides which its range is\r\nobscured by the foliage), than by sensitive smell and singular acuteness\r\nof hearing; and the whole herd is put in instant but noiseless motion\r\ntowards some deeper and more secure retreat. The effectual manner in\r\nwhich an animal of the prodigious size of the elephant can conceal\r\nhimself, and the motionless silence which he preserves, is quite\r\nsurprising; whilst beaters pass and repass within a few yards of his\r\nhiding place, he will maintain his ground till the hunter, creeping\r\nalmost close to his legs, sees his little eye peering out through the\r\nleaves, when, finding himself discovered, the elephant breaks away with\r\na crash, levelling the brushwood in his headlong career.\r\n\r\nIf surprised in open ground, where stealthy retreat is impracticable, a\r\nherd will hesitate in indecision, and, after a few meaningless\r\nmovements, stand huddled together in a group, whilst one or two, more\r\nadventurous than the rest, advance a few steps to reconnoitre. Elephants\r\nare generally observed to be bolder in open ground than in cover, but,\r\nif bold at all, far more dangerous in cover than in open ground.\r\n\r\nIn searching for them, sportsmen often avail themselves of the\r\nexpertness of the native trackers; and notwithstanding the demonstration\r\nof Combe that the brain of the timid Singhalese is deficient in the\r\norgan of destructiveness[1], he shows an instinct for hunting, and\r\nexhibits in the pursuit of the elephant a courage and adroitness far\r\nsurpassing in interest the mere handling of the rifle, which is the\r\nprincipal share of the proceeding that falls to his European companions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _System of Phrenology_, by GEO. COMBE, vol. i. p. 256.]\r\n\r\nThe beater on these occasions has the double task of finding the game\r\nand carrying the guns; and, in an animated communication to me, an\r\nexperienced sportsman describes \"this light and active creature, with\r\nhis long glossy hair hanging down his shoulders, every muscle quivering\r\nwith excitement; and his countenance lighting up with intense animation,\r\nleaping from rock to rock, as nimble as a deer, tracking the gigantic\r\ngame like a blood-hound, falling behind as he comes up with it, and as\r\nthe elephants, baffled and irritated, make the first stand, passing one\r\nrifle into your eager hand and holding the other ready whilst right and\r\nleft each barrel performs its mission, and if fortune does not flag, and\r\nthe second gun is as successful as the first, three or four huge\r\ncarcases are piled one on another within a space equal to the area of a\r\ndining room.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Private letter from Capt. PHILIP PAYNE GALLWEY.]\r\n\r\nIt is curious that in these encounters the herd never rush forward in a\r\nbody, as buffaloes or bisons do, but only one elephant at a time moves\r\nin advance of the rest to confront, or, as it is called, to \"charge,\"\r\nthe assailants. I have heard of but one instance in which _two_ so\r\nadvanced as champions of their companions. Sometimes, indeed, the whole\r\nherd will follow a leader, and manoeuvre in his rear like a body of\r\ncavalry; but so large a party are necessarily liable to panic; and, one\r\nof them having turned in alarm, the entire body retreat with terrified\r\nprecipitation.\r\n\r\nAs regards boldness and courage, a strange variety of temperament is\r\nobservable amongst elephants, but it may be affirmed that they are, much\r\nmore generally timid than courageous. One herd may be as difficult to\r\napproach as deer, gliding away through the jungle so gently and quickly\r\nthat scarcely a trace marks their passage; another, in apparent stupor,\r\nwill huddle themselves together like swine, and allow their assailant to\r\ncome within a few yards before they break away in terror; and a third\r\nwill await his approach without motion, and then advance, with fury to\r\nthe \"charge.\"\r\n\r\nIn individuals the same differences are discernible; one flies on the\r\nfirst appearance of danger, whilst another, alone and unsupported, will\r\nface a whole host of enemies. When wounded and infuriated with pain,\r\nmany of them become literally savage[1]; but, so unaccustomed are they\r\nto act as assailants, and so awkward and inexpert in using their\r\nstrength, that they rarely or ever exceed in killing a pursuer who falls\r\ninto their power. Although the pressure of a foot, a blow with the\r\ntrunk, or a thrust with the tusk, could scarcely fail to prove fatal,\r\nthree-fourths of those who have fallen into their power have escaped\r\nwithout serious injury. So great is this chance of impunity, that the\r\nsportsman prefers to approach within about fifteen paces of the\r\nadvancing elephant, a space which gives time for a second fire should\r\nthe first shot prove ineffectual, and should both fail there is still\r\nopportunity for flight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Some years ago an elephant which had been wounded by a\r\nnative, near Hambangtotte, pursued the man into the town, followed him\r\nalong the street, trampled him to death in the bazaar before a crowd of\r\nspectators, and succeeded in making good its retreat to the jungle.]\r\n\r\nAmongst full-grown timber, a skilful runner can escape from an elephant\r\nby \"dodging\" round the trees, but in cleared land, and low brushwood,\r\nthe difficulty is much increased, as the small growth of underwood which\r\nobstructs the movements of man presents no obstacle to those of an\r\nelephant. On the other hand, on level and open ground the chances are\r\nrather in favour of the elephant, as his pace in full flight exceeds\r\nthat of man, although as a general rule, it is unequal to that of a\r\nhorse, as has been sometimes asserted.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: SHAW, in his _Zoology_, asserts that an elephant can run as\r\nswiftly as a horse can gallop. London, 1800-6, vol. i. p. 216.]\r\n\r\nThe incessant slaughter of elephants by sportsmen in Ceylon, appears to\r\nbe merely in subordination to the influence of the organ of\r\ndestructiveness, since the carcase is never applied to any useful\r\npurpose, but left to decompose and to defile the air of the forest. The\r\nflesh is occasionally tasted as a matter of curiosity: as a steak it is\r\ncoarse and tough; but the tongue is as delicate as that of an ox; and\r\nthe foot is said to make palatable soup. The Caffres attached to the\r\npioneer corps in the Kandyan province are in the habit of securing the\r\nheart of any elephant shot in their vicinity, and say it is their custom\r\nto eat it in Africa. The hide it has been found impracticable to tan in\r\nCeylon, or to convert to any useful purpose, but the bones of those shot\r\nhave of late years been collected and used for manuring coffee estates.\r\nThe hair of the tail, which is extremely strong and horny, is mounted by\r\nthe native goldsmith, and made into bracelets; and the teeth are sawn by\r\nthe Moormen at Galle (as they used to be by the Romans during a scarcity\r\nof ivory) into plates, out of which they fashion numerous articles of\r\nornament, knife-handles, card racks, and \"presse-papiers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst extraordinary recoveries from desperate wounds, I venture to\r\nrecord here an instance which occurred in Ceylon to a gentleman while\r\nengaged in the chase of elephants, and which, I apprehend, has few\r\nparallels in pathological experience. Lieutenant GERARD FRETZ, of the\r\nCeylon Rifle Regiment, whilst firing at an elephant in the vicinity of\r\nFort MacDonald, in Oovah, was wounded in the face by the bursting of his\r\nfowling-piece, on the 22nd January, 1828. He was then about thirty-two\r\nyears of age. On raising him, it was found that part of the breech of\r\nthe gun and about two inches of the barrel had been driven through the\r\nfrontal sinus, at the junction of the nose and forehead. It had sunk\r\nalmost perpendicularly till the iron-plate called \"the tail-pin,\" by\r\nwhich the barrel is made fast to the stock by a screw, had descended\r\nthrough the palate, carrying with it the screw, one extremity of which\r\nhad forced itself into the right nostril, where it was discernible\r\nexternally, whilst the headed end lay in contact with his tongue. To\r\nextract the jagged mass of iron thus sunk in the ethmoidal and\r\nsphenoidal cells was found hopelessly impracticable; but, strange to\r\ntell, after the inflammation subsided, Mr. FRETZ recovered rapidly; his\r\ngeneral health was unimpaired, and he returned to his regiment with\r\nthis, singular appendage firmly embedded behind the bones of his face.\r\nHe took his turn of duty as usual, attained the command of his company,\r\nparticipated in all the enjoyments of the mess-room, and died _eight\r\nyears afterwards_, on the 1st of April, 1836, not from any consequences\r\nof this fearful wound, but from fever and inflammation brought on by\r\nother causes.\r\n\r\nSo little was he apparently inconvenienced by the presence of the\r\nstrange body in his palate that he was accustomed with his finger\r\npartially to undo the screw, which but for its extreme length he might\r\naltogether have withdrawn. To enable this to be done, and possibly to\r\nassist by this means the extraction of the breech itself through the\r\noriginal orifice (which never entirely closed), an attempt was made in\r\n1835 to take off a portion of the screw with a file; but, after having\r\ncut it three parts through the operation was interrupted, chiefly owing\r\nto the carelessness and indifference of Capt. FRETZ, whose death\r\noccurred before the attempt could be resumed. The piece of iron, on\r\nbeing removed after his decease, was found to measure 2-3/4 inches in\r\nlength, and weighed two scruples more than two ounces and three\r\nquarters. A cast of the breech and screw now forms No. 2790 amongst the\r\ndeposits in the Medical Museum of Chatham.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_An Elephant Corral_.\r\n\r\nSo long as the elephants of Ceylon were merely required in small numbers\r\nfor the pageantry of the native princes, or the sacred processions of\r\nthe Buddhist temples, their capture was effected either by the\r\ninstrumentality of female decoys, or by the artifices and agility of the\r\nindividuals and castes who devoted themselves to their pursuit and\r\ntraining. But after the arrival of the European conquerors of the\r\nisland, and when it had become expedient to take advantage of the\r\nstrength and intelligence of these creatures in clearing forests and\r\nmaking roads and other works, establishments were organised on a great\r\nscale by the Portuguese and Dutch, and the supply of elephants kept up\r\nby periodical battues conducted at the cost of the government, on a plan\r\nsimilar to that adopted on the continent of India, when herds varying in\r\nnumber from twenty to one hundred and upwards are driven into concealed\r\nenclosures and secured.\r\n\r\nIn both these processes, success is entirely dependent on the skill with\r\nwhich the captors turn to advantage the terror and inexperience of the\r\nwild elephant, since all attempts would be futile to subdue or confine\r\nby ordinary force an animal of such strength and sagacity.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The device of taking them by means of pitfalls still\r\nprevails in India: but in addition to the difficulty of providing\r\nagainst that caution with which the elephant is supposed to reconnoitre\r\nsuspicious ground, it has the further disadvantage of exposing him to\r\ninjury from bruises and dislocations in his fall. Still it was the mode\r\nof capture employed by the Singhalese, and so late as 1750 WOLF relates\r\nthat the native chiefs of the Wanny, when capturing elephants for the\r\nDutch, made \"pits some fathoms deep in those places whither the elephant\r\nis wont to go in search of food, across which were laid poles covered\r\nwith branches and baited with the food of which he is fondest, making\r\ntowards which he finds himself taken unawares. Thereafter being subdued\r\nby fright and exhaustion, he was assisted to raise himself to the\r\nsurface by means of hurdles and earth, which he placed underfoot as they\r\nwere thrown down to him, till he was enabled to step out on solid\r\nground, when the noosers and decoys were in readiness to tie him up to\r\nthe nearest tree.\"--See WOLF'S _Life and Adventures_, p. 152. Shakspeare\r\nappears to have been acquainted with the plan of taking elephants in\r\npitfalls: Decius, encouraging the conspirators, reminds them of Cæsar's\r\ntaste for anecdotes of animals, by which he would undertake to lure him\r\nto his fate:\r\n\r\n  \"For he loves to hear\r\n  That unicorns may be betrayed with trees.\r\n  And bears with glasses; _elephants with holes_.\"\r\n\r\nJULIUS CÆSAR, Act ii. Scene I.]\r\n\r\nKnox describes with circumstantiality the mode adopted, two centuries\r\nago, by the servants of the King of Kandy to catch elephants for the\r\nroyal stud. He says, \"After discovering the retreat of such as have\r\ntusks, unto these they drive some _she elephants_, which they bring with\r\nthem for the purpose, which, when once the males have got a sight of,\r\nthey will never leave, but follow them wheresoever they go; and the\r\nfemales are so used to it that they will do whatsoever, either by word\r\nor a beck, their keepers bid them. And so they delude them along through\r\ntowns and countries, and through the streets of the city, even to the\r\nvery gates of the king's palace, where sometimes they seize upon them by\r\nsnares, and sometimes by driving them into a kind of pound, they catch\r\nthem.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: KNOX'S _Historical Relation of Ceylon_, A.D. 1681, part i.\r\nch. vi. p. 21.]\r\n\r\nIn Nepaul and Burmah, and throughout the Chin-Indian Peninsula, when in\r\npursuit of single elephants, either _rogues_ detached from the herd, or\r\nindividuals who have been marked for the beauty of their ivory, the\r\nnatives avail themselves of the aid of females in order to effect their\r\napproaches and secure an opportunity of casting a noose over the foot of\r\nthe destined captive. All accounts concur in expressing high admiration\r\nof their courage and address; but from what has fallen under my own\r\nobservation, added to the descriptions I have heard from other\r\neye-witnesses, I am inclined to believe that in such exploits the\r\nMoormen of Ceylon evince a daring and adroitness, surpassing all others.\r\n\r\nThese professional elephant catchers, or, as they are called, Panickeas,\r\ninhabit the Moorish villages in the north and north-east of the island,\r\nand from time immemorial have been engaged in taking elephants, which\r\nare afterwards trained by Arabs, chiefly for the use of the rajahs and\r\nnative princes in the south of India, whose vakeels are periodically\r\ndespatched to make purchases in Ceylon.\r\n\r\nThe ability evinced by these men in tracing elephants through the woods\r\nhas almost the certainty of instinct; and hence their services are\r\neagerly sought by the European sportsmen who go down into their country\r\nin search of game. So keen is their glance, that like hounds running\r\n\"breast high\" they will follow the course of an elephant, almost at the\r\ntop of their speed, over glades covered with stunted grass, where the\r\neye of a stranger would fail to discover a trace of its passage, and on\r\nthrough forests strewn with dry leaves, where it seems impossible to\r\nperceive a footstep. Here they are guided by a bent or broken twig, or\r\nby a leaf dropped from the animal's mouth, on which the pressure of a\r\ntooth may be detected. If at fault, they fetch a circuit like a setter,\r\ntill lighting on some fresh marks, they go a-head again with renewed\r\nvigour. So delicate is the sense of smell in the elephant, and so\r\nindispensable is it to go against the wind in approaching him, that on\r\nthose occasions when the wind is so still that its direction cannot be\r\notherwise discerned, the Panickeas will suspend the film of a gossamer\r\nto determine it and shape their course accordingly.\r\n\r\nThey are enabled by the inspection of the footmarks, when impressed in\r\nsoft clay, to describe the size as well as the number of a herd before\r\nit is seen; the height of an elephant at the shoulder being as nearly as\r\npossible twice the circumference of his fore foot.[1]\r\n\r\nOn overtaking the game their courage is as conspicuous as their\r\nsagacity. If they have confidence in the sportsman for whom they are\r\nfinding, they will advance to the very heel of the elephant, slap him on\r\nthe quarter, and convert his timidity into anger, till he turns upon his\r\ntormentor and exposes his front to receive the bullet which is awaiting\r\nhim.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Previous to the death of the female elephant in the\r\nZoological Gardens, in the Regent's Park, in 1851, Mr. MITCHELL, the\r\nSecretary, caused measurements to be accurately made, and found the\r\nstatement of the Singhalese hunters to be strictly correct, the height\r\nat the shoulders being precisely twice the circumference of the fore\r\nfoot.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Major SKINNER, the Chief Officer at the head of the\r\nCommission of Roads, in Ceylon, in writing to me, mentions an anecdote\r\nillustrative of the daring of the Panickeas. \"I once saw,\" he says, \"a\r\nvery beautiful example of the confidence with which these fellows, from\r\ntheir knowledge of the elephants, meet their worst defiance. It was in\r\nNeuera-Kalawa; I was bivouacking on the bank of a river, and had been\r\nkept out so late that I did not get to my tent until between 9 and 10 at\r\nnight. On our return towards it we passed several single elephants\r\nmaking their way to the nearest water, but at length we came upon a\r\nlarge herd that had taken possession of the only road by which we could\r\npass, and which no intimidation would induce to move off. I had some\r\nPanickeas with me; they knew the herd, and counselled extreme caution.\r\nAfter trying every device we could think of for a length of time, a\r\nlittle old Moorman of the party came to me and requested we should all\r\nretire to a distance. He then took a couple of chules (flambeaux of\r\ndried wood, or coco-nut leaves), one in each hand, and waving them above\r\nhis head till they flamed out fiercely, he advanced at a deliberate pace\r\nto within a few yards of the elephant who was acting as leader of the\r\nparty, and who was growling and trumpeting in his rage, and flourished\r\nthe flaming torches in his face. The effect was instantaneous: the whole\r\nherd dashed away in a panic, bellowing, screaming, and crushing through\r\nthe underwood, whilst we availed ourselves of the open path to make our\r\nway to our tents.\"]\r\n\r\nSo fearless and confident are they that two men, without aid or\r\nattendants, will boldly attempt to capture the largest-sized elephant.\r\nTheir only weapon is a flexible rope made of elk's or buffalo's hide,\r\nwith which it is their object to secure one of the hind legs. This they\r\neffect either by following in its footsteps when in motion or by\r\nstealing close up to it when at rest, and availing themselves of its\r\nwell-known propensity at such moments to swing the feet backwards and\r\nforwards, they contrive to slip a noose over the hind leg.\r\n\r\nAt other times this is achieved by spreading the noose on the ground\r\npartially concealed by roots and leaves beneath a tree on which one of\r\nthe party is stationed, whose business it is to lift it suddenly by\r\nmeans of a cord, raising it on the elephant's leg at the moment when his\r\ncompanion has succeeded in provoking him to place his foot within the\r\ncircle, the other end having been previously made fast to the stem of\r\nthe tree. Should the noosing be effected in open ground, and no tree of\r\nsufficient strength at hand round which to wind the rope, one of the\r\nMoors, allowing himself to be pursued by the enraged elephant, entices\r\nhim towards the nearest grove; where his companion, dexterously laying\r\nhold of the rope as it trails along the ground, suddenly coils it round\r\na suitable stem, and brings the fugitive to a stand still. On finding\r\nhimself thus arrested, the natural impulse of the captive is to turn on\r\nthe man who is engaged in making fast the rope, a movement which it is\r\nthe duty of his colleague to present by running up close to the\r\nelephant's head and provoking the animal to confront him by irritating\r\ngesticulations and taunting shouts of _dah! dah!_ a monosyllable, the\r\nsound of which the elephant peculiarly dislikes. Meanwhile the first\r\nassailant, having secured one noose, comes up from behind with another,\r\nwith which, amidst the vain rage and struggles of the victim, he entraps\r\na fore leg, the rope being, as before, secured to another tree in front,\r\nand the whole four feet having been thus entangled, the capture is\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nA shelter is then run up with branches, to protect their prisoner from\r\nthe sun, and the hunters proceed to build a wigwam for themselves in\r\nfront of him, kindling their fires for cooking, and making all the\r\nnecessary arrangements for remaining day and night on the spot to await\r\nthe process of subduing and taming his rage. In my journeys through the\r\nforest I have come unexpectedly on the halting place of adventurous\r\nhunters when thus engaged; and on one occasion, about sunrise, in\r\nascending the steep ridge from the bed of the Malwatte river, the\r\nforemost rider of our party was suddenly driven back by a furious\r\nelephant, which we found picketed by two Panickeas on the crest of the\r\nbank. In such a position, the elephant soon ceases to struggle; and what\r\nwith the exhaustion of rage and resistance, the terror of fire which he\r\ndreads, and the constant annoyance of smoke which he detests, in a very\r\nshort time, a few weeks at the most, his spirit becomes subdued; and\r\nbeing plentifully supplied with plantains and fresh food, and indulged\r\nwith water, in which he luxuriates, he grows so far reconciled to his\r\nkeepers that they at length venture to remove him to their own village,\r\nor to the sea-side for shipment to India.\r\n\r\nNo part of the hunter's performances exhibits greater skill and audacity\r\nthan this first forced march of the recently captured elephant from the\r\ngreat central forests to the sea-coast. As he is still too morose to\r\nsubmit to be ridden, and as it would be equally impossible to lead or to\r\ndrive him by force, the ingenuity of the captors is displayed in\r\nalternately irritating and eluding him, but always so attracting his\r\nattention as to allure him along in the direction in which they want him\r\nto go. Some assistance is derived from the rope by which the original\r\ncapture was effected, and which, as it serves to make him safe at night,\r\nis never removed from the leg till his taming is sufficiently advanced\r\nto permit of his being entrusted with partial liberty.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon the principal place for exporting these animals to India is\r\nManaar, on the western coast, to which the Arabs from the continent\r\nresort, bringing with them horses to be bartered for elephants. In order\r\nto reach the sea, open plains must be traversed, across which it\r\nrequires the utmost courage, agility, and patience of the Moors to coax\r\ntheir reluctant charge. At Manaar the elephants are usually detained\r\ntill any wound on the leg caused by the rope has been healed, when the\r\nshipment is effected in the most primitive manner. It being next to\r\nimpossible to induce the still untamed creature to walk on board, and no\r\nmechanical contrivances being provided to ship him; a dhoney, or native\r\nboat, of about forty tons' burthen, and about three parts filled with\r\nthe strong ribbed leaves of the Palmyra palm, is brought alongside the\r\nquay in front of the Old Dutch Fort, and lashed so that the gunwale may\r\nbe as nearly as possible on a line with the level of the wharf. The\r\nelephant being placed with his back to the water is forced by goads to\r\nretreat till his hind legs go over the side of the quay, but the main\r\ncontest commences when it is attempted to disengage his fore feet from\r\nthe shore, and force him to entrust himself on board. The scene becomes\r\nexciting from the screams and trumpeting of the elephants, the shouts of\r\nthe Arabs, the calls of the Moors, and the rushing of the crowd.\r\nMeanwhile the huge creature strains every nerve to regain the land; and\r\nthe day is often consumed before his efforts are overcome, and he finds\r\nhimself fairly afloat. The same dhoney will take from four to five\r\nelephants, who place themselves athwart it, and exhibit amusing\r\nadroitness in accommodating their movements to the rolling of the little\r\nvessel; and in this way they are ferried across the narrow strait which\r\nseparates the continent of India from Ceylon.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the _Philosophical Transactions_ for 1701, there is \"An\r\nAccount of the taking of Elephants in Ceylon, by Mr. STRACHAN, a\r\nPhysician who lived seventeen years there,\" in which the author\r\ndescribes the manner in which they were shipped by the Dutch, at Matura,\r\nGalle, and Negombo. A piece of strong sail-cloth having been wrapped\r\nround the elephant's chest and stomach, he was forced into the sea\r\nbetween two tame ones, and there made fast to a boat. The tame ones then\r\nreturned to land, and he swam after the boat to the ship, where tackle\r\nwas reeved to the sail-cloth, and he was hoisted on board.\r\n\r\n\"But a better way has been invented lately,\" says Mr. Strachan; \"a large\r\nflat-bottomed vessel is prepared, covered with planks like a floor; so\r\nthat this floor is almost of a height with the key. Then the sides of\r\nthe key and the vessel are adorned with green branches, so that the\r\nelephant sees no water till he is in the ship.\"--_Phil. Trans._, vol.\r\nxxiii. No. 227, p. 1051.]\r\n\r\nBut the feat of ensnaring and subduing a single elephant, courageous as\r\nit is, and demonstrative of the supremacy with which man wields his\r\n\"dominion over every beast of the earth,\" falls far short of the daring\r\nexploit of capturing a whole herd: when from thirty to one hundred wild\r\nelephants are entrapped in one vast decoy. The mode of effecting this,\r\nas it is practised in Ceylon, is no doubt imitated, but with\r\nconsiderable modifications, from the methods prevalent in various parts\r\nof India. It was introduced by the Portuguese, and continued by the\r\nDutch, the latter of whom had two elephant hunts in each year, and\r\nconducted their operations on so large a scale, that the annual export\r\nafter supplying the government establishments, was from one hundred to\r\none hundred and fifty elephants, taken principally in the vicinity of\r\nMatura, in the southern province, and marched for shipment to Manaar.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: VALENTYN. _Oud en Nieuw Oost-Indien_, ch. xv. p. 272.]\r\n\r\nThe custom in Bengal is to construct a strong enclosure (called a\r\n_keddah_), in the heart of the forest, formed of the trunks of trees\r\nfirmly secured by transverse beams and buttresses, and leaving the gate\r\nfor the entrance of the elephants. A second enclosure, opening from the\r\nfirst, contains water (if possible a rivulet): this, again, communicates\r\nwith a third, which terminates in a funnel-shaped passage, too narrow to\r\nadmit of an elephant turning, and within this the captives being driven\r\nin line, are secured with ropes introduced from the outside, and led\r\naway in custody of tame ones trained for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe _keddah_ being prepared, the first operation is to drive the\r\nelephants towards it, for which purpose vast bodies of men fetch a\r\ncompass in the forest around the haunts of the herds, contracting it by\r\ndegrees, till they complete the enclosure of a certain area, round which\r\nthey kindle fires, and cut footpaths through the jungle, to enable the\r\nwatchers to communicate and combine. All this is performed in cautious\r\nsilence and by slow approaches, to avoid alarming the herd. A fresh\r\ncircle nearer to the _keddah_ is then formed in the same way, and into\r\nthis the elephants are admitted from the first one, the hunters\r\nfollowing from behind, and lighting new fires around the newly inclosed\r\nspace. Day after day the process is repeated; till the drove having been\r\nbrought sufficiently close to make the final rush, the whole party close\r\nin from all sides, and with drums, guns, shouts, and flambeaux, force\r\nthe terrified animals to enter the fatal enclosure, when the passage is\r\nbarred behind them, and retreat rendered impossible.\r\n\r\nTheir efforts to escape are repressed by the crowd, who drive them back\r\nfrom the stockade with spears and flaming torches; and at last compel\r\nthem to pass on into the second enclosure. Here they are detained for a\r\nshort time, and their feverish exhaustion relieved by free access to\r\nwater;--until at last, being tempted by food, or otherwise induced to\r\ntrust themselves in the narrow outlet, they are one after another made\r\nfast by ropes, passed in through the palisade; and picketed in the\r\nadjoining woods to enter on their course of systematic training.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements vary in different districts of Bengal; and the method\r\nadopted in Ceylon differs in many essential particulars from them all;\r\nthe Keddah, or, as it is here called, the corral or _korahl_[1] (from\r\nthe Portuguese _curral_, a \"cattle-pen\"), consists of but one enclosure\r\ninstead of three. A stream or watering-place is not uniformly enclosed\r\nwithin it, because, although water is indispensable after the long\r\nthirst and exhaustion of the captives, it has been found that a pond or\r\nrivulet within the corral itself adds to the difficulty of leading them\r\nout, and increases their reluctance to leave it; besides which, the\r\nsmaller ones are often smothered by the others in their eagerness to\r\ncrowd into the water. The funnel-shaped outlet is also dispensed with,\r\nas the animals are liable to bruise and injure themselves within the\r\nnarrow stockade; and should one of them die in it, as is too often the\r\ncase in the midst of the struggle, the difficulty of removing so great a\r\ncarcase is extreme. The noosing and securing them, therefore, takes\r\nplace in Ceylon within the area of the first enclosure into which they\r\nenter, and the dexterity and daring displayed in this portion of the\r\nwork far surpasses that of merely attaching the rope through the\r\nopenings of the paling, as in an Indian keddah.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is thus spelled by WOLF, in his _Life and Adventures_,\r\np. 144. _Corral_ is at the present day a household word in South\r\nAmerica, and especially in La Plata, to designate an _enclosure for\r\ncattle_.]\r\n\r\nOne result of this change in the system is manifested in the increased\r\nproportion of healthy elephants which are eventually secured and trained\r\nout of the number originally enclosed. The reason of this is obvious:\r\nunder the old arrangements, months were consumed in the preparatory\r\nsteps of surrounding and driving in the herds, which at last arrived so\r\nwasted by excitement and exhausted by privation that numbers died within\r\nthe corral itself, and still more died during the process of training.\r\nBut in later years the labour of months is reduced to weeks, and the\r\nelephants are driven in fresh and full of vigour, so that comparatively\r\nfew are lost either in the enclosure or the stables. A conception of the\r\nwhole operation from commencement to end will be best conveyed by\r\ndescribing the progress of an elephant corral as I witnessed it in 1847\r\nin the great forest on the banks of the Alligator River, the Kimbul-oya,\r\nin the district of Kornegalle, about thirty miles north-west of Kandy.\r\n\r\nKornegalle, or Kurunai-galle, was one of the ancient capitals of the\r\nisland, and the residence of its kings from A.D. 1319 to 1347.[1] The\r\ndwelling-house of the principal civil officer in charge of the district\r\nnow occupies the site of the former palace, and the ground is strewn\r\nwith fragments of columns and carved stones, the remnants of the royal\r\nbuildings. The modern town consists of the bungalows of the European\r\nofficials, each surrounded with its own garden; two or three streets\r\ninhabited by Dutch descendants and by Moors; and a native bazaar, with\r\nthe ordinary array of rice and curry stuffs and cooking chattees of\r\nbrass or burnt clay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See SIR J. EMERSON TENNENT'S _Ceylon_, Vol. I. Pt. III. ch.\r\nxii. p. 415.]\r\n\r\nThe charm of the village is the unusual beauty of its position. It rests\r\nwithin the shade of an enormous rock of gneiss upwards of 600 feet in\r\nheight, nearly denuded of verdure, and so rounded and worn by time that\r\nit has acquired the form of a couchant elephant, from which it derives\r\nits name of Ætagalla, the Rock of the Tusker.[1] But Ætagalla is only\r\nthe last eminence in a range of similarly-formed rocky mountains, which\r\nhere terminate abruptly; and, which from the fantastic shapes into which\r\ntheir gigantic outlines have been wrought by the action of the\r\natmosphere, are called by the names of the Tortoise Rock, the Eel Rock,\r\nand the Rock of the Tusked Elephant. So impressed are the Singhalese by\r\nthe aspect of these stupendous masses that in ancient grants lands are\r\nconveyed in perpetuity, or \"so long as the sun and the moon, so long as\r\nÆtagalla and Andagalla shall endure.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Another enormous mass of gneiss is called the\r\nKuruminiagalla, or the Beetle-rock, from its resemblance in shape to the\r\nback of that insect, and hence is said to have been derived the name of\r\nthe town, _Kuruna-galle_ or Kornegalle.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: FORBES quotes a Tamil conveyance of land, the purchaser of\r\nwhich is to \"possess and enjoy it as long as the sun and the moon, the\r\nearth and its vegetables, the mountains and the River Cauvery\r\nexist.\"--_Oriental Memoirs_, vol. ii. chap. ii. It will not fail to be\r\nobserved, that the same figure was employed in Hebrew literature as a\r\ntype of duration--\" They shall fear thee, _so long as the sun and moon\r\nendure_; throughout all generations.\"--Psalm lxxii. 5, 17.]\r\n\r\nKornegalle is the resort of Buddhists from the remotest parts of the\r\nisland, who come to visit an ancient temple on the summit of the great\r\nrock, to which access is had from the valley below by means of steep\r\npaths and steps hewn out of the solid stone. Here the chief object of\r\nveneration is a copy of the sacred footstep hollowed in the granite,\r\nsimilar to that which confers sanctity on Adam's Peak, the towering apex\r\nof which, about forty miles distant, the pilgrims can discern from\r\nÆtagalla.\r\n\r\nAt times the heat at Kornegalle is intense, in consequence of the\r\nperpetual glow diffused from these granite cliffs. The warmth they\r\nacquire during the blaze of noon becomes almost intolerable towards\r\nevening, and the sultry night is too short to permit them to cool\r\nbetween the setting and the rising of the sun. The district is also\r\nliable to occasional droughts when the watercourses fail, and the tanks\r\nare dried up. One of these calamities occurred about the period of my\r\nvisit, and such was the suffering of the wild animals that numbers of\r\ncrocodiles and bears made their way into the town to drink at the wells.\r\nThe soil is prolific in the extreme; rice, cotton, and dry grain are\r\ncultivated largely in the valley. Every cottage is surrounded by gardens\r\nof coco-nuts, arecas, jak-fruit and coffee; the slopes, under tillage,\r\nare covered with luxuriant vegetation, and, as far as the eye can reach\r\non every side, there are dense forests intersected by streams, in the\r\nshade of which the deer and the elephant abound.\r\n\r\nIn 1847 arrangements were made for one of the great elephant hunts for\r\nthe supply of the Civil Engineer's Department, and the spot fixed on by\r\nMr. Morris, the Government officer who conducted the corral, was on the\r\nbanks of the Kimbul river, about fifteen miles from Kornegalle. The\r\ncountry over which we rode to the scene of the approaching capture\r\nshowed traces of the recent drought, the fields lay to a great extent\r\nuntilled, owing to the want of water, and the tanks, almost reduced to\r\ndryness, were covered with the leaves of the rose-coloured lotus.\r\n\r\nOur cavalcade was as oriental as the scenery through which it moved; the\r\nGovernor and the officers of his staff and household formed a long\r\ncortege, escorted by the native attendants, horse-keepers, and\r\nfoot-runners. The ladies were borne in palankins, and the younger\r\nindividuals of the party carried in chairs raised on poles, and covered\r\nwith cool green awnings made of the fresh leaves of the talipat palm.\r\n\r\nAfter traversing the cultivated lands, the path led across open glades\r\nof park-like verdure and beauty, and at last entered the great-forest\r\nunder the shade of ancient trees wreathed to their crowns with climbing\r\nplants and festooned by natural garlands of convolvulus and orchids.\r\nHere silence reigned, disturbed only by the murmuring hum of glittering\r\ninsects, or the shrill clamour of the plum-headed parroquet and the\r\nflute-like calls of the golden oriole.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the broad sandy beds of two rivers over-arched by tall trees,\r\nthe most conspicuous of which is the Kombook[1], from the calcined bark\r\nof which the natives extract a species of lime to be used with their\r\nbetel. And from the branches hung suspended over the water the gigantic\r\npods of the huge puswæl bean[2], the sheath of which measures six feet\r\nlong by five or six inches broad.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Pentaptera paniculata_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Entada pursætha_.]\r\n\r\nOn ascending the steep bank of the second stream, we found ourselves in\r\nfront of the residences which had been extemporised for our party in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the corral. These cool and enjoyable structures\r\nwere formed of branches and thatched with palm leaves and fragrant lemon\r\ngrass; and in addition to a dining-room and suites of bedrooms fitted\r\nwith tent furniture, they included kitchens, stables, and storerooms,\r\nall run up by the natives in the course of a few days.\r\n\r\nIn former times, the work connected with these elephant hunts was\r\nperformed by the \"forced labour\" of the natives, as part of that feudal\r\nservice which under the name of Raja-kariya was extorted from the\r\nSinghalese during the rule of their native sovereigns. This system was\r\ncontinued by the Portuguese and Dutch, and prevailed under the British\r\nGovernment till its abolition by the Earl of Ripon in 1832. Under it\r\nfrom fifteen hundred to two thousand men superintended by their headmen,\r\nused to be occupied, in constructing the corral, collecting the\r\nelephants, maintaining the cordon of watch-fires and watchers, and\r\nconducting all the laborious operations of the capture. Since the\r\nabolition of Raja-kariya, however, no difficulty has been found in\r\nobtaining the voluntary co-operation of the natives on these exciting\r\noccasions. The government defrays the expense of that portion of the\r\npreparations which involves actual cost,--for the skilled labour\r\nexpended in the erection of the corral and its appurtenances, and the\r\nproviding of spears, ropes, arms, flutes, drums, gunpowder, and other\r\nnecessaries for the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe period of the year selected is that which least interferes with the\r\ncultivation of the rice-lands (in the interval between seed time and\r\nharvest), and the people themselves, in addition to the excitement and\r\nenjoyment of the sport, have a personal interest in reducing the number\r\nof elephants, which inflict serious injury on their gardens and growing\r\ncrops. For a similar reason the priests encourage the practice, because\r\nthe elephants destroy their sacred Bo-trees, of the leaves of which they\r\nare passionately fond; besides which it promotes the facility for\r\nobtaining elephants for the processions of the temples: and the\r\nRata-mahat-mayas and headmen have a pride in exhibiting the number of\r\nretainers who follow them to the field, and the performances of the tame\r\nelephants which they lend for the business of the corral. Thus vast\r\nnumbers of the peasantry are voluntarily occupied for many weeks in\r\nputting up the stockades, cutting paths through the jungle, and\r\nrelieving the beaters who are engaged in surrounding and driving in the\r\nelephants.\r\n\r\nIn selecting the scene for the hunt a position is chosen which lies on\r\nsome old and frequented route of the animals, in their periodical\r\nmigrations in search of forage and water; and the vicinity of a stream\r\nis indispensable, not only for the supply of the elephants during the\r\ntime spent in inducing them to approach the enclosure, but to enable\r\nthem to bathe and cool themselves throughout the process of training\r\nafter capture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUND PLAN OF A CORRAL, AND METHOD OF FENCING IT.]\r\n\r\nIn constructing the corral itself, care is taken to avoid disturbing the\r\ntrees or the brushwood within the included space, and especially on the\r\nside by which the elephants are to approach, where it is essential to\r\nconceal the stockade as much as possible by the density of the foliage.\r\nThe trees used in the structure are from ten to twelve inches in\r\ndiameter; and are sunk about three feet in the earth, so as to leave a\r\nlength of from twelve to fifteen feet above ground; with spaces between\r\neach stanchion sufficiently wide to permit a man to glide through. The\r\nuprights are made fast by transverse beams, to which they are lashed\r\nsecurely by ratans and flexible climbing plants, or as they are called\r\n\"jungle ropes,\" and the whole is steadied by means of forked supports,\r\nwhich grasp the tie beams, and prevent the work from being driven\r\noutward by the rush of the wild elephants.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion I am now attempting to describe, the space thus enclosed\r\nwas about 500 feet in length by 250 wide. At one end an entrance was\r\nleft open, fitted with sliding bars, so prepared as to be capable of\r\nbeing instantly shut;--and from each angle of the end by which the\r\nelephants were to approach, two lines of the same strong fencing were\r\ncontinued, and cautiously concealed by the trees; so that if, instead of\r\nentering by the open passage, the herd should swerve to right, or left,\r\nthey would find themselves suddenly stopped and forced to retrace their\r\ncourse to the gate.\r\n\r\nThe preparations were completed by placing a stage for the Governor's\r\nparty on a group of the nearest trees looking down into the enclosure,\r\nso that a view could be had of the entire proceeding, from the entrance\r\nof the herd, to the leading out of the captive elephants.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to observe that the structure here described,\r\nmassive as it is, would be entirely ineffectual to resist the shock, if\r\nassaulted by the full force of an enraged elephant; and accidents have\r\nsometimes happened by the breaking through of the herd; but reliance is\r\nplaced not so much on the resistance of the stockade as on the timidity\r\nof the captives and their unconsciousness of their own strength, coupled\r\nwith the daring of their captors and their devices for ensuring\r\nsubmission.\r\n\r\nThe corral being prepared, the beaters address themselves to drive in\r\nthe elephants. For this purpose it is often necessary to fetch a circuit\r\nof many miles in order to surround a sufficient number, and the caution\r\nto be observed involves patience and delay; as it is essential to avoid\r\nalarming the elephants, which might otherwise escape. Their disposition\r\nbeing essentially peaceful, and their only impulse to browse in solitude\r\nand security, they withdraw instinctively before the slightest\r\nintrusion, and advantage is taken of this timidity and love of seclusion\r\nto cause only just such an amount of disturbance as will induce them to\r\nreturn slowly in the direction which it is desired they should take.\r\nSeveral herds are by this means concentrated within such an area as will\r\nadmit of their being completely surrounded by the watchers; and day\r\nafter day, by degrees, they are moved gradually onwards to the immediate\r\nconfines of the corral. When their suspicions become awakened and they\r\nexhibit restlessness and alarm, bolder measures are adopted for\r\npreventing their escape. Fires are kept burning at ten paces apart,\r\nnight and day, along the circumference of the area within which they are\r\ndetained; a corps of from two to three thousand beaters is completed,\r\nand pathways are carefully cleared through the jungle so as to keep open\r\na communication along the entire circuit. The headmen keep up a constant\r\npatrol, to see that their followers are alert at their posts, since\r\nneglect at any one spot might permit the escape of the herd, and undo in\r\na moment the vigilance of weeks. By this means any attempt of the\r\nelephants to break away is generally checked, and on any point\r\nthreatened a sufficient force can be promptly assembled to drive them\r\nback. At last the elephants are forced onwards so close to the\r\nenclosure, that the investing cordon is united at either end with the\r\nwings of the corral, the whole forming a circle of about two miles,\r\nwithin the area of which the herd is detained to await the signal for\r\nthe final drive.\r\n\r\nTwo months had been spent in these preliminaries, and the preparations\r\nhad been thus far completed, on the day when we arrived and took our\r\nplaces on the stage erected for us, overlooking the entrance to the\r\ncorral. Close beneath us a group of tame elephants sent by the temples\r\nand the chiefs to assist in securing the wild ones, were picketed in the\r\nshade, and lazily fanning themselves with leaves. Three distinct herds,\r\nwhose united numbers were variously represented at from forty to fifty\r\nelephants, were enclosed, and were at that moment concealed in the\r\njungle within a short distance of the stockade. Not a sound was\r\npermitted to be made, each person spoke to his neighbour in whispers,\r\nand such was the silence observed by the multitude of the watchers at\r\ntheir posts, that occasionally we could hear the rustling of the\r\nbranches as some of the elephants stripped off a leaf.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the signal was made, and the stillness of the forest was broken\r\nby the shouts of the guard, the rolling of the drums and tom-toms, and\r\nthe discharge of muskets; and beginning at the most distant side of the\r\narea, the elephants were urged forward at a rapid pace towards the\r\nentrance into the corral.\r\n\r\nThe watchers along the line kept silence only till the herd had passed\r\nthem, and then joining the cry in their rear they drove them onward with\r\nredoubled shouts and noises. The tumult increased as the terrified rout\r\ndrew near, swelling now on one side now on the other, as the herd in\r\ntheir panic dashed from point to point in their endeavours to force the\r\nline, but they were instantly driven back by screams, muskets, and\r\ndrums.\r\n\r\nAt length the breaking of the branches and the crackling of the\r\nbrushwood announced their close approach, and the leader bursting from\r\nthe jungle rushed wildly forward to within twenty yards of the entrance\r\nfollowed by the rest of the herd. Another moment and they would have\r\nplunged into the open gate, when suddenly they wheeled round, re-entered\r\nthe forest, and in spite of the hunters resumed their original position.\r\nThe chief headman came forward and accounted for the freak by saying\r\nthat a wild pig[1], an animal which the elephants are said to dislike,\r\nhad started out of the cover and run across the leader, who would\r\notherwise have held on direct for the corral; and intimated that as the\r\nherd was now in the highest pitch of excitement: and it was at all times\r\nmuch more difficult to effect a successful capture by daylight than by\r\nnight when the fires and flambeaux act with double effect, it was the\r\nwish of the hunters to defer their final effort till the evening, when\r\nthe darkness would greatly aid their exertions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Fire, the sound of a horn, and the grunting of a boar are\r\nthe three things which the Greeks, in the middle ages, believed the\r\nelephant specially to dislike:\r\n\r\n  [Greek:\r\n  Pyr de ptoeitai kai krion kerasphoron,\r\n  Kai tôn moniôn tên boên tên athroan.]\r\n\r\n    --PHILE, _Expositio de Elephante_, 1. 177.]\r\n\r\nAfter sunset the scene exhibited was of extraordinary interest; the low\r\nfires, which had apparently only smouldered in the sunlight, assumed\r\ntheir ruddy glow amidst the darkness, and threw their tinge over the\r\ngroups collected round them; while the smoke rose in eddies through the\r\nrich foliage of the trees. The crowds of spectators maintained a\r\nprofound silence, and not a sound was perceptible beyond the hum of an\r\ninsect. On a sudden the stillness was broken by the distant roll of a\r\ndrum, followed by a discharge of musketry. This was the signal for the\r\nrenewed assault, and the hunters entered the circle with shouts and\r\nclamour; dry leaves and sticks were flung upon the watch-fires till they\r\nblazed aloft, and formed a line of flame on every side, except in the\r\ndirection of the corral, which was studiously kept dark; and thither the\r\nterrified elephants betook themselves, followed by the yells and racket\r\nof their pursuers.\r\n\r\nThe elephants approached at a rapid pace, trampling down the brushwood\r\nand crushing the dry branches; the leader emerged in front of the\r\ncorral, paused for an instant, stared wildly round, and then rushed\r\nheadlong through the open gate, followed by the rest of the herd.\r\nInstantly, as if by magic, the entire circuit of the corral, which up to\r\nthis moment had been kept in profound darkness, blazed with thousands of\r\nlights, every hunter on the instant that the elephants entered, rushing\r\nforward to the stockade with a torch kindled at the nearest watch-fire.\r\n\r\nThe elephants first dashed to the very extremity of the enclosure, and\r\nbeing brought up by the fence, retreated to regain the gate, but found\r\nit closed. Their terror was sublime: they hurried round the corral at a\r\nrapid pace, but saw it now girt by fire on every side; they attempted to\r\nforce the stockade, but were driven back by the guards with spears and\r\nflambeaux; and on whichever side they approached they were repulsed with\r\nshouts and volleys of musketry. Collecting into one group, they would\r\npause for a moment in apparent bewilderment, then burst off in another\r\ndirection, as if it had suddenly occurred to them to try some point\r\nwhich they had before overlooked; but again baffled, they slowly\r\nreturned to their forlorn resting-place in the centre of the corral.\r\n\r\nThe attraction of this strange scene was not confined to the spectators;\r\nit extended to the tame elephants which were stationed outside. At the\r\nfirst approach of the flying herd they evinced the utmost interest. Two\r\nin particular which were picketed near the front were intensely excited,\r\nand continued tossing their heads, pawing the ground, and starting as\r\nthe noise drew near. At length, when the grand rush into the corral took\r\nplace, one of them fairly burst from her fastenings and rushed towards\r\nthe herd, levelling a tree of considerable size which obstructed her\r\npassage.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The other elephant, a fine tusker, which belonged to\r\nDehigam Ratamahatmeya, continued in extreme excitement throughout all\r\nthe subsequent operations of the capture, and at last, after attempting\r\nto break its way into the corral, shaking the bars with its forehead and\r\ntusks, it went off in a state of frenzy into the jungle. A few days\r\nafter the Aratchy went in search of it with a female decoy, and watching\r\nits approach, sprang fairly on the infuriated beast, with a pair of\r\nsharp hooks in his hands, which he pressed into tender parts in front of\r\nthe shoulder, and thus held the elephant firmly till chains were passed\r\nover its legs, and it permitted itself to be led quietly away.]\r\n\r\nFor upwards of an hour the elephants continued to traverse the corral\r\nand assail the palisade with unabated energy, trumpeting and screaming\r\nwith rage after each disappointment. Again and again they attempted to\r\nforce the gate, as if aware, by experience, that it ought to afford an\r\nexit as it had already served as an entrance, but they shrank back\r\nstunned and bewildered. By degrees their efforts became less and less\r\nfrequent. Single ones rushed excitedly here and there, returning\r\nsullenly to their companions after each effort; and at last the whole\r\nherd, stupified and exhausted, formed themselves into a single group,\r\ndrawn up in a circle with the young in the centre, and stood motionless\r\nunder the dark shade of the trees in the middle of the corral.\r\n\r\nPreparations were now made to keep watch during the night, the guard was\r\nreinforced around the enclosure, and wood heaped on the fires to keep up\r\na high flame till sunrise.\r\n\r\nThree herds had been originally entrapped by the beaters outside; but\r\nwith characteristic instinct they had each kept clear of the other,\r\ntaking up different stations in the space invested by the watchers. When\r\nthe final drive took place one herd only had entered the enclosure, the\r\nother two keeping behind; and as the gate had to be instantly shut on\r\nthe first division, the last were unavoidably excluded and remained\r\nconcealed in the jungle. To prevent their escape, the watchers were\r\nordered to their former stations, the fires were replenished; and all\r\nprecautions having been taken, we returned to pass the night in our\r\nbungalows by the river.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Captives._\r\n\r\nAs our sleeping-place was not above two hundred yards from the corral,\r\nwe were frequently awakened by the din of the multitude who were\r\nbivouacking in the forest, by the merriment round the watch-fires, and\r\nnow and then by the shouts with which the guards repulsed some sudden\r\ncharge of the elephants in attempts to force the stockade. But at\r\ndaybreak, on going down to the corral, we found all still and vigilant.\r\nThe fires were allowed to die out as the sun rose, and the watchers who\r\nhad been relieved were sleeping near the great fence, the enclosure on\r\nall sides being surrounded by crowds of men and boys with spears or\r\nwhite peeled wands about ten feet long, whilst the elephants within were\r\nhuddled together in a compact group, no longer turbulent and restless,\r\nbut exhausted and calm, and utterly subdued by apprehension and\r\namazement at all that had been passing around them.\r\n\r\nNine only had been as yet entrapped[1], of which three were very large,\r\nand two were little creatures but a few months old. One of the large\r\nones was a \"rogue\" and being unassociated with the rest of the herd, he\r\nwas not admitted to their circle, although permitted to stand near them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In some of the elephant hunts conducted in the southern\r\nprovinces of Ceylon by the earlier British Governors, as many as 170 and\r\n200 elephants were secured in a single corral, of which a portion only\r\nwere taken out for the public service, and the rest shot, the motive\r\nbeing to rid the neighbourhood of them, and thus protect the crops from\r\ndestruction. In the present instance, the object being to secure only as\r\nmany as were required for the Government stud, it was not sought to\r\nentrap more than could conveniently be attended to and trained after\r\ncapture.]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, preparations were making outside to conduct the tame\r\nelephants into the corral, in order to secure the captives. Noosed ropes\r\nwere in readiness; and far apart from all stood a party of the out-caste\r\nRodiyas, the only tribe who will touch a dead carcase, to whom,\r\ntherefore, the duty is assigned of preparing the fine flexible rope for\r\nnoosing, which is made from the fresh hides of the deer and the buffalo.\r\n\r\nAt length, the bars which secured the entrance to the corral were\r\ncautiously withdrawn, and two trained elephants passed stealthily in,\r\neach ridden by its mahout (or _ponnekella_, as the keeper is termed in\r\nCeylon), and one attendant; and, carrying a strong collar, formed by\r\ncoils of rope made from coco-nut fibre, from which hung on either side\r\ncords of elk's hide, prepared with a ready noose. Along with these, and\r\nconcealed behind them, the headman of the \"_cooroowe_,\" or noosers,\r\ncrept in, eager to secure the honour of taking the first elephant, a\r\ndistinction which this class jealously contests with the mahouts of the\r\nchiefs and temples. He was a wiry little man, nearly seventy years old,\r\nwho had served in the same capacity under the Kandyan king, and wore two\r\nsilver bangles, which had been conferred on him in testimony of his\r\nprowess. He was accompanied by his son, named Ranghanie, equally\r\nrenowned for his courage and dexterity.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion ten tame elephants were in attendance; two were the\r\nproperty of an adjoining temple (one of which had been caught but the\r\nyear before, yet it was now ready to assist in capturing others), four\r\nbelonged to the neighbouring chiefs, and the rest, including the two\r\nwhich first entered the corral, were part of the Government stud. Of the\r\nlatter, one was of prodigious age, having been in the service of the\r\nDutch and English Governments in succession for upwards of a century.[1]\r\nThe other, called by her keeper \"Siribeddi,\" was about fifty years old,\r\nand distinguished for gentleness and docility. She was a most\r\naccomplished decoy, and evinced the utmost relish for the sport. Having\r\nentered the corral noiselessly, carrying a mahout on her shoulders with\r\nthe headman of the noosers seated behind him, she moved slowly along\r\nwith a sly composure and an assumed air of easy indifference; sauntering\r\nleisurely in the direction of the captives, and halting now and then to\r\npluck a bunch of grass or a few leaves as she passed. As she approached\r\nthe herd, they put themselves in motion to meet her, and the leader,\r\nhaving advanced in front and passed his trunk gently over her head,\r\nturned and paced slowly back to his dejected companions. Siribeddi\r\nfollowed with the same listless step, and drew herself up close behind\r\nhim, thus affording the nooser an opportunity to stoop under her and\r\nslip the noose over the hind foot of the wild one. The latter instantly\r\nperceived his danger, shook off the rope, and turned to attack the man.\r\nHe would have suffered for his temerity had not Siribeddi protected him\r\nby raising her trunk and driving the assailant into the midst of the\r\nherd, when the old man, being slightly wounded, was helped out of the\r\ncorral, and his son, Ranghanie, took his place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This elephant is since dead; she grew infirm and diseased,\r\nand died at Colombo in 1848. Her skeleton is now in the Museum of the\r\nNatural History Society at Belfast.]\r\n\r\nThe herd again collected in a circle, with their heads towards the\r\ncentre. The largest male was singled out, and two tame ones pushed\r\nboldly in, one on either side of him, till the three stood nearly\r\nabreast. He made no resistance, but betrayed his uneasiness by shifting\r\nrestlessly from foot to foot. Ranghanie now crept up, and, holding the\r\nrope open with both hands (its other extremity being made fast to\r\nSiribeddi's collar), and watching the instant when the wild elephant\r\nlifted its hind-foot, succeeded in passing the noose over its leg, drew\r\nit close, and fled to the rear. The two tame elephants instantly fell\r\nback, Siribeddi stretched the rope to its full length, and, whilst she\r\ndragged out the captive, her companion placed himself between her and\r\nthe herd to prevent any interference.\r\n\r\nIn order to tie him to a tree he had to be drawn backwards some twenty\r\nor thirty yards, making furious resistance, bellowing in terror,\r\nplunging on all sides, and crushing the smaller timber, which bent like\r\nreeds beneath his clumsy struggles. Siribeddi drew him steadily after\r\nher, and wound the rope round the proper tree, holding it all the time\r\nat its full tension, and stepping cautiously across it when, in order to\r\ngive it a second turn, it was necessary to pass between the tree and the\r\nelephant. With a coil round the stem, however, it was beyond her\r\nstrength to haul the prisoner close up, which was, nevertheless,\r\nnecessary in order to make him perfectly fast; but the second tame one,\r\nperceiving the difficulty, returned from the herd, confronted the\r\nstruggling prisoner, pushed him shoulder to shoulder, and head to head,\r\nforcing him backwards, whilst at every step Siribeddi hauled in the\r\nslackened rope till she brought him fairly up to the foot of the tree,\r\nwhere he was made fast by the cooroowe people. A second noose was then\r\npassed over the other hind-leg, and secured like the first, both legs\r\nbeing afterwards hobbled together by ropes made from the fibre of the\r\nkitool or jaggery palm, which, being more flexible than that of the\r\ncoco-nut, occasions less formidable ulcerations. The two decoys then\r\nranged themselves, as before, abreast of the prisoner on either side,\r\nthus enabling Ranghanie to stoop under them and noose the two fore-feet\r\nas he had already done the hind; and these ropes being made fast to a\r\ntree in front, the capture was complete, and the tame elephants and\r\nkeepers withdrew to repeat the operation on another of the herd.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs long as the tame ones stood beside him the poor animal remained\r\ncomparatively calm and almost passive under his distress, but the moment\r\nthey moved off, and he was left utterly alone, he made the most\r\nsurprising efforts to set himself free and rejoin his companions. He\r\nfelt the ropes with his trunk and tried to untie the numerous knots; he\r\ndrew backwards to liberate his fore-legs, then leaned forward to\r\nextricate the hind ones, till every branch of the tall tree vibrated\r\nwith his struggles. He screamed in anguish, with his proboscis raised\r\nhigh in the air, then falling on his side he laid his head to the\r\nground, first his cheek and then his brow, and pressed down his\r\ndoubled-in trunk as though he would force it into the earth; then\r\nsuddenly rising he balanced himself on his forehead and forelegs,\r\nholding his hind-feet fairly off the ground. This scene of distress\r\ncontinued some hours, with occasional pauses of apparent stupor, after\r\nwhich the struggle was from time to time renewed convulsively, and as if\r\nby some sudden impulse; but at last the vain strife subsided, and the\r\npoor animal remained perfectly motionless, the image of exhaustion and\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Ranghanie presented himself in front of the governor's stage\r\nto claim the accustomed largesse for tying the first elephant. He was\r\nrewarded by a shower of rupees, and retired to resume his perilous\r\nduties in the corral.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the herd were now in a state of pitiable dejection, and\r\npressed closely together as if under a sense of common misfortune. For\r\nthe most part they stood at rest in a compact body, fretful and uneasy.\r\nAt intervals one more impatient than the rest would move out a few steps\r\nto reconnoitre; the others would follow at first slowly, then at a\r\nquicker pace, and at last the whole herd would rush off furiously to\r\nrenew the often-baffled attempt to storm the stockade.\r\n\r\nThere was a strange combination of the sublime and the ridiculous in\r\nthese abortive onsets; the appearance of prodigious power in their\r\nponderous limbs, coupled with the almost ludicrous shuffle of their\r\nclumsy gait, and the fury of their apparently resistless charge,\r\nconverted in an instant into timid retreat. They rushed madly down the\r\nenclosure, their backs arched, their tails extended, their ears spread,\r\nand their trunks raised high above their heads, trumpeting and uttering\r\nshrill screams, yet when one step further would have dashed the opposing\r\nfence into fragments, they stopped short on a few white rods being\r\npointed at them through the paling[1]; and, on catching the derisive\r\nshouts of the crowd, they turned in utter discomfiture, and after an\r\nobjectless circle or two through the corral, they paced slowly back to\r\ntheir melancholy halting place in the shade.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The fact of the elephant exhibiting timidity, on having a\r\nlong rod pointed towards him, was known to the Romans; and PLINY,\r\nquoting from the annals of PISO, relates, that in order to inculcate\r\ncontempt for want of courage in the elephant, they were introduced into\r\nthe circus during the triumph of METELLUS, after the conquest of the\r\nCarthaginians in Sicily, and _driven round the area by workmen holding\r\nblunted spears_,--\"Ab operariis hastas præpilatas habentibus, per circum\r\ntotam actos.\"--Lib. viii. c. 6.]\r\n\r\nThe crowd, chiefly comprised of young men and boys, exhibited\r\nastonishing nerve and composure at such moments, rushing up to the point\r\ntowards which the elephants charged, pointing their wands at their\r\ntrunks, and keeping up the continual cry of _whoop! whoop!_ which\r\ninvariably turned them to flight.\r\n\r\nThe second victim singled out from the herd was secured in the same\r\nmanner as the first. It was a female. The tame ones forced themselves in\r\non either side as before, cutting her off from her companions, whilst\r\nRanghanie stooped under them and attached the fatal noose, and Siribeddi\r\ndragged her out amidst unavailing struggles, when she was made fast by\r\neach leg to the nearest group of strong trees. When the noose was placed\r\nupon her fore-foot, she seized it with her trunk, and succeeded in\r\ncarrying it to her mouth, where she would speedily have severed it had\r\nnot a tame elephant interfered, and placing his foot on the rope pressed\r\nit downwards out of her jaws. The individuals who acted as leaders in\r\nthe successive charges on the palisades were always those selected by\r\nthe noosers, and the operation of tying each, from the first approaches\r\nof the decoys, till the captive was left alone by the tree, occupied on\r\nan average somewhat less than three-quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\nIt is strange that in these encounters the wild elephants made no\r\nattempt to attack or dislodge the mahouts or the cooroowes, who rode on\r\nthe tame ones. They moved in the very midst of the herd, any individual\r\nin which could in a moment have pulled the riders from their seats; but\r\nno effort was made to molest them.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"In a corral, to be on a tame elephant, seems to insure\r\nperfect immunity from the attacks of the wild ones. I once saw the old\r\nchief Mollegodde ride in amongst a herd of wild elephants, on a small\r\nelephant; so small that the Adigar's head was on a level the back of the\r\nwild animals: I felt very nervous, but he rode right in among them, and\r\nreceived not the slightest molestation.\"--_Letter from_ MAJOR SKINNER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs one after another their leaders wore entrapped and forced away from\r\nthem, the remainder of the group evinced increased emotion and\r\nexcitement; but whatever may have been their sympathy for their lost\r\ncompanions, their alarm seemed to prevent them at first from following\r\nthem to the trees to which they had been tied. In passing them\r\nafterwards they sometimes stopped, mutually entwined their trunks,\r\nlapped them round each other's limbs and neck, and exhibited the most\r\ntouching distress at their detention, but made no attempt to disturb the\r\ncords that bound them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe variety of disposition in the herd as evidenced by difference of\r\ndemeanour was very remarkable: some submitted with comparatively little\r\nresistance; whilst others in their fury dashed themselves on the ground\r\nwith a force sufficient to destroy any weaker animal. They vented their\r\nrage upon every tree and plant within reach; if small enough to be torn\r\ndown, they levelled them with their trunks, and stripping them of their\r\nleaves and branches, they tossed them wildly over their heads on all\r\nsides. Some in their struggles made no sound, whilst others bellowed and\r\ntrumpeted furiously, then uttered short convulsive screams, and at last,\r\nexhausted and hopeless, gave vent to their anguish in low and piteous\r\nmoanings. Some, after a few violent efforts of this kind, lay motionless\r\non the ground, with no other indication of suffering than the tears\r\nwhich suffused their eyes and flowed incessantly. Others in all the\r\nvigour of their rage exhibited the most surprising contortions; and to\r\nus who had been accustomed to associate with the unwieldy bulk of the\r\nelephant the idea that he must of necessity be stiff and inflexible, the\r\nattitudes into which they forced themselves were almost incredible. I\r\nsaw one lie with the cheek pressed to the earth, and the fore-legs\r\nstretched in front, whilst the body was twisted round till the hind-legs\r\nextended in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nIt was astonishing that their trunks were not wounded by the violence\r\nwith which they flung them on all sides. One twisted his proboscis into\r\nsuch fantastic shapes, that it resembled the writhings of a gigantic\r\nworm; he coiled it and uncoiled it with restless rapidity, curling it up\r\nlike a watch-spring, and suddenly unfolding it again to its full length.\r\nAnother, which lay otherwise motionless in all the stupor of hopeless\r\nanguish, slowly beat the ground with the extremity of his trunk, as a\r\nman in despair beats his knee with the palm of his hand.\r\n\r\nThey displayed an amount of sensitiveness and delicacy of touch in the\r\nfoot, which was very remarkable in a limb of such clumsy dimensions and\r\nprotected by so thick a covering. The noosers could always force them to\r\nlift it from the ground by the gentlest touch of a leaf or twig,\r\napparently applied so as to tickle; but the imposition of the rope was\r\ninstantaneously perceived, and if it could not be reached by the trunk\r\nthe other foot was applied to feel its position, and if possible remove\r\nit before the noose could be drawn tight.\r\n\r\nOne practice was incessant with almost the entire herd: in the interval\r\nbetween their struggles they beat the ground with their fore feet, and\r\ntaking up the dry earth in a coil of the trunk, they flung it\r\ndexterously over every part of their body. Even when lying down, the\r\nsand within reach was thus collected and scattered over their limbs:\r\nthen inserting the extremity of the trunk in their mouths, they withdrew\r\na quantity of water, which they discharged over their backs, repeating\r\nthe operation again and again, till the dust was thoroughly saturated. I\r\nwas astonished at the quantity of water thus applied, which was\r\nsufficient when the elephant, as was generally the case, had worked the\r\nspot where he lay into a hollow, to convert its surface into a coating\r\nof mud. Seeing that the herd had been now twenty-four hours without\r\naccess to water of any kind, surrounded by watch-fires, and exhausted by\r\nstruggling and terror, the supply of moisture an elephant is capable of\r\ncontaining in the receptacle attached to his stomach must be very\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of the tame ones during all these proceedings was truly\r\nwonderful. They displayed the most perfect conception of every movement,\r\nboth of the object to be attained, and of the means to accomplish it.\r\n\r\nThey manifested the utmost enjoyment in what was going on. There was no\r\nill-humour, no malignity in the spirit displayed, in what was otherwise\r\na heartless proceeding, but they set about it in a way that showed a\r\nthorough relish for it, as an agreeable pastime. Their caution was as\r\nremarkable as their sagacity; there was no hurrying, no contusion, they\r\nnever ran foul of the ropes, were never in the way of the animals\r\nalready noosed; and amidst the most violent struggles, when the tame\r\nones had frequently to step across the captives, they in no instance\r\ntrampled on them, or occasioned the slightest accident or annoyance. So\r\nfar from this, they saw intuitively a difficulty or a danger, and\r\naddressed themselves unbidden to remove it. In tying up one of the\r\nlarger elephants, he contrived before he could be hauled close up to the\r\ntree, to walk once or twice round it, carrying the rope with him; the\r\ndecoy, perceiving the advantage he had thus gained over the nooser,\r\nwalked up of her own accord, and pushed him backwards with her head,\r\ntill she made him unwind himself again; upon which the rope was hauled\r\ntight and made fast. More than once, when a wild one was extending his\r\ntrunk, and would have intercepted the rope about to be placed over his\r\nleg, Siribeddi, by a sudden motion of her own trunk, pushed his aside,\r\nand prevented him; and on one occasion, when successive efforts had\r\nfailed to put the noose over the fore-leg of an elephant which was\r\nalready secured by one foot, but which wisely put the other to the\r\nground as often as it was attempted to pass the noose under it, I saw\r\nthe decoy watch her opportunity, and when his foot was again raised,\r\nsuddenly push in her own leg beneath it, and hold it up till the noose\r\nwas attached and drawn tight.\r\n\r\nOne could almost fancy there was a display of dry humour in the manner\r\nin which the decoys thus played with the fears of the wild herd, and\r\nmade light of their efforts at resistance. When reluctant they shoved\r\nthem forward, when violent they drove them back; when the wild ones\r\nthrew themselves down, the tame ones butted them with head and\r\nshoulders, and forced them up again. And when it was necessary to keep\r\nthem down, they knelt upon them, and prevented them from rising, till\r\nthe ropes were secured.\r\n\r\nAt every moment of leisure they fanned themselves with a bunch of\r\nleaves, and the graceful ease with which an elephant uses his trunk on\r\nsuch occasions is very striking. It is doubtless owing to the\r\ncombination of a circular with a horizontal movement in that flexible\r\nlimb; but it is impossible to see an elephant fanning himself without\r\nbeing struck by the singular elegance of motion which he displays. The\r\ntame ones, too, indulged in the luxury of dusting themselves with sand,\r\nby flinging it from their trunks; but it was a curious illustration of\r\ntheir delicate sagacity, that so long as the mahout was on their necks,\r\nthey confined themselves to flinging the dust along their sides and\r\nstomach, as if aware, that to throw it over their heads and back would\r\ncause annoyance to their riders.\r\n\r\nOne of the decoys which rendered good service, and was obviously held in\r\nspecial awe by the wild herd, was a tusker belonging to Dehigame\r\nRata-mahatmeya. It was not that he used his tusks for purposes of\r\noffence, but he was enabled to insinuate himself between two elephants\r\nby wedging them in where he could not force his head; besides which they\r\nassisted him in raising up the fallen and refractory with greater ease.\r\nIn some instances where the intervention of the other decoys failed to\r\nreduce a wild one to order, the mere presence and approach of the tusker\r\nseemed to inspire fear, and insure submission, without more active\r\nintervention.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether it was the surprising qualities exhibited by the\r\ntame elephants that cast the courage and dexterity of the men into the\r\nshade, but even when supported by the presence, the sagacity, and\r\nco-operation of these wonderful creatures, the part sustained by the\r\nnoosers can bear no comparison with the address and daring displayed by\r\nthe _pícador_ and _matador_ in a Spanish bull-fight. They certainly\r\npossessed great quickness of eye in watching the slightest movement of\r\nthe elephant, and great expertness in flinging the noose over its foot\r\nand attaching it firmly before the animal could tear it off with its\r\ntrunk; but in all this they had the cover of the decoys to conceal them;\r\nand their shelter behind which to retreat. Apart from the services\r\nwhich, from their prodigious strength, the tame elephants are alone\r\ncapable of rendering, in dragging out and securing the captives, it is\r\nperfectly obvious that without their co-operation the utmost prowess and\r\ndexterity of the hunters would not avail them, unsupported, to enter the\r\ncorral and ensnare and lead out a single captive.\r\n\r\nOf the two tiny elephants which were entrapped, one was about ten months\r\nold, the other somewhat more. The smaller one had a little bolt head\r\ncovered with woolly brown hair, and was the most amusing and interesting\r\nminiature imaginable. Both kept constantly with the herd, trotting after\r\nthem in every charge; when the others stood at rest they ran in and out\r\nbetween the legs of the older ones; and not their own mothers alone, but\r\nevery female in the group caressed them in turn.\r\n\r\nThe dam of the youngest was the second elephant singled out by the\r\nnoosers, and as she was dragged along by the decoys, the little creature\r\nkept by her side till she was drawn close to the fatal tree. The men at\r\nfirst were rather amused than otherwise by its anger; but they found\r\nthat it would not permit them to place the second noose upon its mother;\r\nit ran between her and them, it tried to seize the rope, it pushed them\r\nand struck them with its little trunk, till they were forced to drive it\r\nback to the herd. It retreated slowly, shouting all the way, and pausing\r\nat every step to look back. It then attached itself to the largest\r\nfemale remaining in the group, and placed itself across her forelegs,\r\nwhilst she hung down her trunk over its side and soothed and caressed\r\nit. Here it continued moaning and lamenting; till the noosers had left\r\noff securing its mother, when it instantly returned to her side; but as\r\nit became troublesome again, attacking every one who passed, it was at\r\nlast tied up by a rope to an adjoining tree, to which the other young\r\none was also tied. The second little one, equally with its playmate,\r\nexhibited great affection for its dam; it went willingly with its captor\r\nas far as the tree to which she was fastened, and in passing her\r\nstretched out its trunk and tried to rejoin her; but finding itself\r\nforced along, it caught at every twig and branch within its reach, and\r\nscreamed with grief and disappointment.\r\n\r\nThese two little creatures were the most vociferous of the whole herd,\r\ntheir shouts were incessant, they struggled to attack every one within\r\nreach; and as their bodies were more lithe and pliant than those of\r\ngreater growth, their contortions were quite wonderful. The most amusing\r\nthing was, that in the midst of all their agony and affliction, the\r\nlittle fellows seized on every article of food that was thrown to them,\r\nand ate and roared simultaneously.\r\n\r\nAmongst the last of the elephants noosed was the rogue. Though far more\r\nsavage than the others, he joined in none of their charges and assaults\r\non the fences, as they uniformly drove him off and would not permit him\r\nto enter their circle. When dragged past another of his companions in\r\nmisfortune, who was lying exhausted on the ground, he flew upon him and\r\nattempted to fasten his teeth in his head; this was the only instance of\r\nviciousness which occurred during the progress of the corral. When tied\r\nup and overpowered, he was at first noisy and violent, but soon lay down\r\npeacefully, a sign, according to the hunters, that his death was at\r\nhand. Their prognostication was correct; he continued for about twelve\r\nhours to cover himself with dust like the others, and to moisten it with\r\nwater from his trunk; but at length he lay exhausted, and died so\r\ncalmly, that having been moving but a few moment before, his death was\r\nonly perceived by the myriads of black flies by which his body was\r\nalmost instantly covered, although not one was visible a moment\r\nbefore.[1] The Rodiyas were called in to loose the ropes that bound him,\r\nfrom the tree, and two tame elephants being harnessed to the dead body,\r\nit was dragged to a distance without the corral.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The surprising faculty of vultures for discovering carrion,\r\nhas been a subject of much speculation, as to whether it be dependent on\r\ntheir power of sight or of scent. It is not, however, more mysterious\r\nthan the unerring certainty and rapidity with which some of the minor\r\nanimals, and more especially insects, in warm climates congregate around\r\nthe offal on which they feed. Circumstanced as they are, they must be\r\nguided towards their object mainly if not exclusively by the sense of\r\nsmell; but that which excites astonishment is the small degree of odour\r\nwhich seems to suffice for the purpose; the subtlety and rapidity with\r\nwhich it traverses and impregnates the air; and the keen and quick\r\nperception with which it is taken up by the organs of those creatures.\r\nThe instance of the scavenger beetles has been already alluded to; the\r\npromptitude with which they discern the existence of matter suited to\r\ntheir purposes, and the speed with which they hurry to it from all\r\ndirections; often from distances as extraordinary, proportionably, as\r\nthose traversed by the eye of the vulture. In the instance of the dying\r\nelephant referred to above, life was barely extinct when the flies, of\r\nwhich not one was visible but a moment before, arrived in clouds and\r\nblackened the body by their multitude; scarcely an instant was allowed\r\nto elapse for the commencement of decomposition; no odour of\r\nputrefaction could be discerned by us who stood close by; yet some\r\npeculiar smell of mortality, simultaneously with parting breath, must\r\nhave summoned them to the feast. Ants exhibit an instinct equally\r\nsurprising. I have sometimes covered up a particle of refined sugar with\r\npaper on the centre of a polished table; and counted the number of\r\nminutes which would elapse before it was fastened on by the small black\r\nants of Ceylon, and a line formed to lower it safely to the floor. Here\r\nwas a substance which, to our apprehension at least, is altogether\r\ninodorous, and yet the quick sense of smell must have been the only\r\nconductor of the ants. It has been observed of those fishes which travel\r\noverland on the evaporation of the ponds in which they live, that they\r\ninvariably march in the direction of the nearest water, and even when\r\ncaptured, and placed on the floor of a room, their efforts to escape are\r\nalways made towards the same point. Is the sense of smell sufficient to\r\naccount for this display of instinct in them? or is it aided by special\r\norgans in the case of the others? Dr. MCGEE, formerly of the Royal Navy,\r\nwriting to me on the subject of the instant appearance of flies in the\r\nvicinity of dead bodies, says: \"In warm climates they do not wait for\r\ndeath to invite them to the banquet. In Jamaica I have again and again\r\nseen them settle on a patient, and hardly to be driven away by the\r\nnurse, the patient himself saying. 'Here are these flies coming to eat\r\nme ere I am dead.' At times they have enabled the doctor, when otherwise\r\nhe would have been in doubt as to his prognosis, to determine whether\r\nthe strange apyretic interval occasionally present in the last stage of\r\nyellow fever was the fatal lull or the lull of recovery; and 'What say\r\nthe flies?' has been the settling question. Among many, many cases\r\nduring a long period I have seen but one recovery after the assembling\r\nof the flies. I consider the foregoing as a confirmation of smell being\r\nthe guide even to the attendants, a cadaverous smell has been perceived\r\nto arise from the body of a patient twenty-four hours before death.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen every wild elephant had been noosed and tied up, the scene\r\npresented was truly oriental. From one to two thousand natives, many of\r\nthem in gaudy dresses and armed with spears, crowded about the\r\nenclosures. Their families had collected to see the spectacle; women,\r\nwhose children clung like little bronzed Cupids by their sides; and\r\ngirls, many of them in the graceful costume of that part of the\r\ncountry,--a scarf, which, after having been brought round the waist, is\r\nthrown over the left shoulder, leaving the right arm and side free and\r\nuncovered.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of each tree was its captive elephant; some still struggling\r\nand writhing in feverish excitement, whilst others, in exhaustion and\r\ndespair, lay motionless, except that, from time to time, they heaped\r\nfresh dust upon their heads. The mellow notes of a Kandyan flute, which\r\nwas played at a distance, had a striking effect upon one or more of\r\nthem; they turned their heads in the direction from which the music\r\ncame, expanded their broad ears, and were evidently soothed with the\r\nplaintive sound. The two young ones alone still roared for freedom; they\r\nstamped their feet, and blew clouds of dust over their shoulders,\r\nbrandishing their little trunks aloft, and attacking every one who came\r\nwithin their reach.\r\n\r\nAt first the older ones, when secured, spurned every offer of food,\r\ntrampled it under foot, and turned haughtily away. A few, however, as\r\nthey became more composed, could not resist the temptation of the juicy\r\nstems of the plantain, but rolling them under foot, till they detached\r\nthe layers, they raised them in their trunks, and commenced chewing\r\nlistlessly.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, whilst the sagacity, the composure, and docility of the\r\ndecoys were such as to excite lively astonishment, it was not possible\r\nto withhold the highest admiration from the calm and dignified demeanour\r\nof the captives. Their entire bearing was at variance with the\r\nrepresentation made by some of the \"sportsmen\" who harass them, that\r\nthey are treacherous, savage, and revengeful; when tormented by the guns\r\nof their persecutors, they, no doubt, display their powers and sagacity\r\nin efforts to retaliate or escape; but here their every movement was\r\nindicative of innocence and timidity. After a struggle, in which they\r\nevinced no disposition to violence or revenge, they submitted with the\r\ncalmness of despair. Their attitudes were pitiable, their grief was most\r\ntouching, and their low moaning went to the heart. We could not have\r\nborne to witness their distress had their capture been effected by the\r\nneedless infliction of pain, or had they been destined to ill-treatment\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nIt was now about two hours after noon, and the first elephants that had\r\nentered the corral having been disposed of, preparations were made to\r\nreopen the gate, and drive in the other two herds, over which the\r\nwatchers were still keeping guard. The area of the enclosure was\r\ncleared; and silence was again imposed on the crowds who surrounded the\r\ncorral. The bars that secured the entrance were withdrawn and every\r\nprecaution repeated as before; but as the space inside was now somewhat\r\ntrodden down, especially near the entrance, by the frequent charges of\r\nthe last herd, and as it was to be apprehended that the others might be\r\nearlier alarmed and retrace their steps, before the barricades could be\r\nreplaced, two tame ones were stationed inside to protect the men to whom\r\nthat duty was assigned.\r\n\r\nAll preliminaries being at length completed, the signal was given; the\r\nbeaters on the side most distant from the corral closed in with tom-toms\r\nand discordant noises; a hedge-fire of musketry was kept up in the rear\r\nof the terrified elephants; thousands of voices urged them forward; we\r\nheard the jungle crashing as they came on, and at last they advanced\r\nthrough an opening amongst the trees, bearing down all before them like\r\na charge of locomotives. They were led by a huge female, nearly nine\r\nfeet high, after whom one half of the herd dashed precipitately through\r\nthe narrow entrance, but the rest turning suddenly towards the left,\r\nsucceeded in forcing the cordon of guards and making good their escape\r\nto the forest.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the others passed the gate, than the two tame elephants\r\nstepped forward from either side, and before the herd could return from\r\nthe further end of the enclosure, the bars were drawn, the entrance\r\nclosed, and the men in charge glided outside the stockade. The elephants\r\nwhich had previously been made prisoners within exhibited intense\r\nexcitement as the fresh din arose around them; they started to their\r\nfeet, and stretched their trunks in the direction whence they winded the\r\nscent of the herd in its headlong flight; and as the latter rushed past,\r\nthey renewed their struggles to get free and follow. It is not possible\r\nto imagine anything more exciting than the spectacle which the wild ones\r\npresented careering round the corral, uttering piercing screams, their\r\nheads erect and trunks aloft, the very emblems of rage and perplexity,\r\nof power and helplessness.\r\n\r\nAlong with those which entered at the second drive was one that\r\nevidently belonged to another herd, and had been separated from them in\r\nthe _mêlée_ when the latter effected their escape, and, as usual, his\r\nnew companions in misfortune drove him off indignantly as often as he\r\nattempted to approach them.\r\n\r\nThe demeanour of those taken in the second drive differed materially\r\nfrom that of the preceding captives, who, having entered the corral in\r\ndarkness, to find themselves girt with fire and smoke, and beset by\r\nhideous sounds and sights on every side, were speedily reduced by fear\r\nto stupor and submission--whereas, the second herd having passed into\r\nthe enclosure by daylight, and its area being trodden down in many\r\nplaces, could clearly discover the fences, and were consequently more\r\nalarmed and enraged at their confinement. They were thus as restless as\r\nthe others had been calm, and so much more vigorous in their assaults\r\nthat, on one occasion, their courageous leader, undaunted by the\r\nmultitude of white wands thrust towards her, was only driven back from\r\nthe stockade by a hunter hurling a blazing flambeau at her head. Her\r\nattitude as she stood repulsed, but still irresolute, was a study for a\r\npainter. Her eye dilated, her ears expanded, her back arched like a\r\ntiger, and her fore-foot in air, whilst she uttered those hideous\r\nscreams that are imperfectly described by the term \"_trumpeting_.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough repeatedly passing by the unfortunates from the former drove,\r\nthe new herd seemed to take no friendly notice of them; they halted\r\ninquiringly for a minute, and then resumed their career round the\r\ncorral, and once or twice in their headlong flight they rushed madly\r\nover the bodies of the prostrate captives as they lay in their misery on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nIt was evening before the new captives had grown wearied with their\r\nfurious and repeated charges, and stood still in the centre of the\r\ncorral collected into a terrified and motionless group. The fires were\r\nthen relighted, the guard redoubled by the addition of the watchers, who\r\nwere now relieved from duty in the forest, and the spectators retired to\r\ntheir bungalows for the night. The business of the _third day_ began by\r\nnoosing and tying up the new captives, and the first sought out was\r\ntheir magnificent leader. Siribeddi and the tame tusker having forced\r\nthemselves on either side of her, a boy in the service of the\r\nRata-Mahatmeya succeeded in attaching a rope to her hind-foot. Siribeddi\r\nmoved off, but feeling her strength insufficient to drag the reluctant\r\nprize, she went down on her fore-knees, so as to add the full weight of\r\nher body to the pull. The tusker, seeing her difficulty, placed himself\r\nin front of the prisoner, and forced her backwards, step by step, till\r\nhis companion, brought her fairly up to the tree, and wound the rope\r\nround the stem. Though overpowered by fear, she showed the fullest sense\r\nof the nature of the danger she had to apprehend. She kept her head\r\nturned towards the noosers, and tried to step in advance of the decoys;\r\nin spite of all their efforts, she tore off the first noose from her\r\nfore-leg, and placing it under her foot, snapped it into fathom lengths.\r\nWhen finally secured, her writhings were extraordinary. She doubled in\r\nher head under her chest, till she lay as round as a hedgehog, and\r\nrising again, stood on her fore-feet, and lifting her hind-feet off the\r\nground, she wrung them from side to side, till the great tree above her\r\nquivered in every branch.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to catch the others, we requested that the smaller\r\ntrees and jungle, which partially obstructed our view, might be broken\r\naway, being no longer essential to screen the entrance to the corral;\r\nand five of the tame elephants were brought up for the purpose. They\r\nfelt the strength of each tree with their trunks, then swaying it\r\nbackwards and forwards, by pushing it with their foreheads, they watched\r\nthe opportunity when it was in full swing to raise their fore-feet\r\nagainst the stem, and bear it down to the ground. Then tearing off the\r\nfestoons of climbing plants, and trampling down the smaller branches and\r\nbrushwood, they pitched them with their tusks, piling them into heaps\r\nalong the side of the fence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration of elephant resisting capture.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the last that was secured was the solitary individual belonging\r\nto the fugitive herd. When they attempted to drag him backwards from the\r\ntree near which he was noosed, he laid hold of it with his trunk and lay\r\ndown on his side immoveable. The temple tusker and another were ordered\r\nup to assist, and it required the combined efforts of the three\r\nelephants to force him along. When dragged to the place at which he was\r\nto be tied up, he continued the contest with desperation, and to prevent\r\nthe second noose being placed on his foot, he sat down on his haunches,\r\nalmost in the attitude of the \"Florentine Boar,\" keeping his hind-feet\r\nbeneath him, and defending his fore-feet with his trunk, with which he\r\nflung back the rope as often as it was attempted to attach it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration of elephant lying on ground after capture.]\r\n\r\nWhen overpowered and made fast, his grief was most affecting; his\r\nviolence sunk to utter prostration, and he lay on the ground, uttering\r\nchoking cries, with tears trickling down his cheeks.\r\n\r\nThe final operation was that of slackening the ropes, and marching each\r\ncaptive down to the river between two tame ones. This was effected very\r\nsimply. A decoy, with a strong collar round its neck, stood on either\r\nside of the wild one, on which a similar collar was formed, by\r\nsuccessive coils of coco-nut rope; and then, connecting the three\r\ncollars together, the prisoner was effectually made safe between his two\r\nguards. During this operation, it was curious to see how the tame\r\nelephant, from time to time, used its trunk to shield the arm of its\r\nrider, and ward off the trunk of the prisoner, who resisted the placing\r\nthe rope round his neck. This done, the nooses were removed from his\r\nfeet, and he was marched off to the river, in which he and his\r\ncompanions were allowed to bathe; a privilege of which all availed\r\nthemselves eagerly. Each was then made fast to a tree in the forest, and\r\nkeepers being assigned to him, with a retinue of leaf-cutters, he was\r\nplentifully supplied with his favourite food, and left to the care and\r\ntuition of his new masters.\r\n\r\nReturning from a spectacle such as I have attempted to describe, one\r\ncannot help feeling how immeasurably it exceeds in interest those royal\r\nbattues where timid deer are driven in crowds to unresisting slaughter;\r\nor those vaunted \"wild sports\" the amusement of which appears to be in\r\nproportion to the effusion of blood. Here the only display of power was\r\nthe imposition of restraint; and though considerable mortality often\r\noccurs amongst the animals caught, the infliction of pain, so far from\r\nbeing an incident of the operation, is most cautiously avoided from its\r\ntendency to enrage, the policy of the captor being to conciliate and\r\nsoothe. The whole scene exhibits the most marvellous example of the\r\nvoluntary alliance of animal sagacity and instinct in active\r\nco-operation with human intelligence and courage; and nothing else in\r\nnature, not even the chase of the whale, can afford so vivid an\r\nillustration of the sovereignty of man over brute creation even when\r\nconfronted with force in its most stupendous embodiment.\r\n\r\nOf the two young elephants which were taken in the corral, the smallest\r\nwas sent down to my house at Colombo, where he became a general\r\nfavourite with the servants. He attached himself especially to the\r\ncoachman, who had a little shed erected for him near his own quarters at\r\nthe stables. But his favourite resort was the kitchen, where he received\r\na daily allowance of milk and plantains, and picked up several other\r\ndelicacies besides. He was innocent and playful in the extreme, and when\r\nwalking in the grounds he would trot up to me, twine his little trunk\r\nround my arm, and coax me to take him to the fruit-trees. In the evening\r\nthe grass-cutters now and then indulged him by permitting him to carry\r\nhome a load of fodder for the horses, on which occasions he assumed an\r\nair of gravity that was highly amusing, showing that he was deeply\r\nimpressed with the importance and responsibility of the service\r\nentrusted to him. Being sometimes permitted to enter the dining-room,\r\nand helped to fruit at desert, he at last learned his way to the\r\nside-board; and on more than one occasion having stolen in, during the\r\nabsence of the servants, he made a clear sweep of the wine-glasses and\r\nchina in his endeavours to reach a basket of oranges. For these and\r\nsimilar pranks we were at last forced to put him away. He was sent to\r\nthe Government stud, where he was affectionately received and adopted by\r\nSiribeddi, and he now takes his turn of public duty in the department of\r\nthe Commissioner of Roads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nTHE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\n      *        *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Conduct in Captivity._\r\n\r\nThe idea prevailed in ancient times, and obtains even at the present\r\nday, that the Indian elephant surpasses that of Africa in sagacity and\r\ntractability, and consequently in capacity for training, so as to render\r\nits services more available to man. There does not appear to me to be\r\nsufficient ground for this conclusion. It originated, in all\r\nprobability, in the first impressions created by the accounts of the\r\nelephant brought back by the Greeks after the Indian expedition of\r\nAlexander, and above all by the descriptions of Aristotle, whose\r\nknowledge of the animal was derived exclusively from the East. A long\r\ninterval elapsed before the elephant of Africa, and its capabilities,\r\nbecame known in Europe. The first elephants brought to Greece by\r\nAntipater, were from India, as were also those introduced by Pyrrhus\r\ninto Italy. Taught by this example, the Carthaginians undertook to\r\nemploy African elephants in war. Jugurtha led them against Metellus, and\r\nJuba against Cæsar; but from inexperienced and deficient training, they\r\nproved less effective than the elephants of India[1], and the historians\r\nof these times ascribed to inferiority of race, that which was but the\r\nresult of insufficient education.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ARMANDI, _Hist. Milit. des Eléphants_, liv. i. ch. i. p. 2.\r\nIt is an interesting fact, noticed by ARMANDI, that the elephants\r\nfigured on the coins of Alexander, and the Seleucidæ invariably exhibit\r\nthe characteristics of the Indian type, whilst those on Roman medals can\r\nat once be pronounced African, from the peculiarities of the convex\r\nforehead and expansive ears.--_Ibid_. liv. i. cap. i. p. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nARMANDI has, with infinite industry, collected from original sources a\r\nmass of curious informations relative to the employment of elephants in\r\nancient warfare, which he has published under the title of _Histoire\r\nMilitaire des Eléphants depuis les temps les plus reculés jusqu' à\r\nl'introduction des armes a feu_. Paris. 1843.]\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be remembered that the elephants which, at a later\r\nperiod, astonished the Romans by their sagacity, and whose performances\r\nin the amphitheatre have been described by Ælian and Pliny, were brought\r\nfrom Africa, and acquired their accomplishments from European\r\ninstructors[1]; a sufficient proof that under equally favourable\r\nauspices the African species are capable of developing similar docility\r\nand powers with those of India. It is one of the facts from which the\r\ninferiority of the Negro race has been inferred, that they alone, of all\r\nthe nations amongst whom the elephant is found, have never manifested\r\nability to domesticate it; and even as regards the more highly developed\r\nraces who inhabited the valley of the Nile, it is observable that the\r\nelephant is nowhere to be found amongst the animals figured on the\r\nmonuments of ancient Egypt, whilst the camelopard, the lion, and even\r\nthe hippopotamus are represented. And although in later times the\r\nknowledge of the art of training appears to have existed under the\r\nPtolemies, and on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, it admits of\r\nno doubt that it was communicated by the more accomplished natives of\r\nIndia who had settled there.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ÆLIAN, lib. ii. cap. ii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See SCHLEGEL'S Essay on the Elephant and the Sphynx.\r\n_Classical Journal_, No. lx. Although the trained elephant nowhere\r\nappears upon the monuments of the Egyptians, the animal was not unknown\r\nto them, and ivory and elephants are figured on the walls of Thebes and\r\nKarnac amongst the spoils of Thothmes III., and the tribute paid to\r\nRameses I. The Island of Elephantine, in the Nile, near Assouan (Syene)\r\nis styled in hieroglyphical writing \"The Land of the Elephant;\" but as\r\nit is a mere rock, it probably owes its designation to its form. See Sir\r\nGARDNER WILKINSON'S _Ancient Egyptians_, vol. i. pl. iv.; vol. v. p.\r\n176. Above the first cataract of the Nile are two small islands, each\r\nbearing the name of Phylæ;--quære, is the derivation of this word at all\r\nconnected with the Arabic term _fil_? See ante, p. 76, note. The\r\nelephant figured in the sculptures of Nineveh is universally as wild,\r\nnot domesticated.]\r\n\r\nAnother favourite doctrine of the earlier visitors to the East seems to\r\nme to be equally fallacious; PYRARD, BERNIER, PHILLIPE, THEVENOT, and\r\nother travellers in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, proclaimed\r\nthe superiority of the elephant of Ceylon, in size, strength, and\r\nsagacity, above those of all other parts of India[1]; and TAVERNIER in\r\nparticular is supposed to have stated that if a Ceylon elephant be\r\nintroduced amongst those bred in any other place, by an instinct of\r\nnature they do him homage by laying their trunks to the ground, and\r\nraising them reverentially. This passage has been so repeatedly quoted\r\nin works on Ceylon that it has passed into an aphorism, and is always\r\nadduced as a testimony to the surpassing intelligence of the elephants\r\nof that island; although a reference to the original shows that\r\nTavernier's observations are not only fanciful in themselves, but are\r\nrestricted to the supposed excellence of the Ceylon animal _in war_.[2]\r\nThis estimate of the superiority of the elephant of Ceylon, if it ever\r\nprevailed in India, was not current there at a very early period; for in\r\nthe _Ramayana_, which is probably the oldest epic in the world, the stud\r\nof Dasartha, the king of Ayodhya, was supplied with elephants from the\r\nHimalaya and the Vindhya Mountains.[3] I have had no opportunity of\r\ntesting by personal observation the justice of the assumption; but from\r\nall that I have heard of the elephants of the continent, and seen of\r\nthose of Ceylon, I have reason to conclude that the difference, if not\r\nimaginary, is exceptional, and must have arisen in particular and\r\nindividual instances, from more judicious or elaborate instruction.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is merely a reiteration of the statement of ÆLIAN, who\r\nascribes to the elephants of Taprobane a vast superiority in size,\r\nstrength, and intelligence, above, those of continental India,--[Greek:\r\n\"Kai oide ge næsiotai elephantes ton hæpiroton halkimoteroi te tæn\r\nrhomæn kai meixous idein eisi, kai thumosophoteroi de panta pantæ\r\nkrinointo han.\"]--ÆLIAN, _De Nat. Anim_., lib. Xvi. Cap. xviii.\r\n\r\nÆLIAN also, in the same chapter, states the fact of the shipment of\r\nelephants in large boats from Ceylon to the opposite continent of India,\r\nfor sale to the king of Kalinga; so that the export from Manaar,\r\ndescribed in a former passage, has been going on apparently without\r\ninterruption since the time of the Romans.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The expression of TAVERNIER is to the effect that as\r\ncompared with all others, the elephants of Ceylon are \"plus courageux _à\r\nla guerre_.\" The rest of the passage is a curiosity:--\r\n\r\n\"Il faut remarquer ici une chose qu'on aura peut-être de la peine à\r\ncroire main quit est toutefois très-véritable: c'est que lorsque quelque\r\nroi on quelque seigneur a quelqu'un de ces éléphants de Ceylan, et qu'on\r\nen amène quelqu'autre des lieux où les marchands vont les prendre, comme\r\nd'Achen, de Siam, d'Arakan, de Pegu, du royáume de Boutan, d'Assam, des\r\nterres de Cochin et de la coste du Mélinde, dés que les éléphants en\r\nvoient un de Ceylan, par un instinct de nature, ils lui font la\r\nrévérence, portant le bout de leur trompe à la terre et la relevant. Il\r\nest vrai que les éléphants que les grand seigneurs entretiennent, quand\r\nen les amine devant eux, pour voir s'ils sent en bon point, font troi\r\nfois une espére de révérence avec leur troupe, _a que j'ai en souvent_,\r\nmais ils sont stylés à cela, et leurs maitres le leur enseignent de\r\nbonne heure.\"--_Les Six Voyages de_ J.B. TAVERNIER, lib. iii. ch. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ramayana_, sec. vi.: CAREY and MARSHMAN, i. 105: FAUCHE,\r\nt. i. p. 66.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest knowledge of the elephant in Europe and the West, was\r\nderived from the conspicuous position assigned to it in the wars of the\r\nEast: in India, from the remotest antiquity, it formed one of the most\r\npicturesque, if not the most effective, features in the armies of the\r\nnative princes.[1] It is more than probable that the earliest attempts\r\nto take and train the elephant, were with a view to military uses, and\r\nthat the art was perpetuated in later times to gratify the pride of the\r\neastern kings, and sustain the pomp of their processions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The only mention of the elephant in Sacred History in the\r\naccount given in _Maccabees_ of the invasion of Egypt by Antiochus, who\r\nentered it 170 B.C., \"with chariots and elephants, and horsemen, and a\r\ngreat navy.\"--1 _Macc_. i. 17. Frequent allusions to the use of\r\nelephants in war occur in both books: and in chap. vi. 34, it is stated\r\nthat \"to provoke the elephants to fight they showed them the blood of\r\ngrapes and of mulberries.\" The term showed, \"[Greek: edeixan],\" might be\r\nthought to imply that the animals were enraged by the sight of the wine\r\nand its colour, but in the Third Book of Maccabees, in the Greek\r\nSeptuagint, various other passages show that wine, on such occasions,\r\nwas administered to the elephants to render them furious.--Mace, v. 2.\r\n10, 45. PHILE mentions the same fact, _De Elephante_, i. 145.\r\n\r\nThere is a very curious account of the mode in which the Arab conquerors\r\nof Seinde, in the 9th and 10th centuries, equipped the elephant for war;\r\nwhich being written with all the particularity of an eye-witness, bears\r\nthe impress of truth and accuracy. MASSOUDI, who was born in Bagdad at\r\nthe close of the 9th century, travelled in India in the year A.D. 913,\r\nand visited the Gulf of Cambay, the coast of Malabar, and the Island of\r\nCeylon:--from a larger account of his journeys he compiled a summary\r\nunder the title of \"_Moroudj al-dzeheb,\" or the \"Golden Meadows_,\" the\r\nMS. of which is now in the Bibliothèque Nationale. M. REINAUD, in\r\ndescribing this manuscript says on its authority, \"The Prince of\r\nMensura, whose dominions lay south of the Indus, maintained eighty\r\nelephants trained for war, each of which bore in his trunk a bent\r\ncymeter (carthel), with which he was taught to cut and thrust at all\r\nconfronting him. The trunk itself was effectually protected by a coat of\r\nmail, and the rest of the body enveloped in a covering composed jointly\r\nof iron and horn. Other elephants were employed in drawing chariots,\r\ncarrying baggage, and grinding forage, and the performance of all\r\nbespoke the utmost intelligence and docility.\"--REINAUD, _Mèmoires sur\r\nl'Inde, antérieurement au milieu du XIe siècle, d'après les écrivains\r\narabes, persans et chinois_. Paris, M.D.CCC. XLIX. p. 215. See\r\nSPRENGER'S English Translation of Massoudi, vol. i. p. 383.]\r\n\r\nAn impression prevails even to the present day, that the process of\r\ntraining is tedious and difficult, and the reduction of a full-grown\r\nelephant to obedience, slow and troublesome in the extreme.[1] In both\r\nparticulars, however, the contrary is the truth. The training as it\r\nprevails in Ceylon is simple, and the conformity and obedience of the\r\nanimal are developed with singular rapidity. For the first three days,\r\nor till they will eat freely, which they seldom do in a less time, the\r\nnewly-captured elephants are allowed to stand quiet; and, if\r\npracticable, a tame elephant is tied near to give the wild ones\r\nconfidence. Where many elephants are being trained at once, it is\r\ncustomary to put every new captive between the stalls of half-tamed\r\nones, when it soon takes to its food. This stage being attained,\r\ntraining commences by placing tame elephants on either side. The\r\n\"cooroowe vidahn,\" or the head of the stables, stands in front of the\r\nwild elephants holding a long stick with a sharp iron point. Two men are\r\nthen stationed one on either side, assisted by the tame elephants, and\r\neach holding a _hendoo_ or crook[2] towards the wild one's trunk, whilst\r\none or two others rub their hands over his back, keeping up all the\r\nwhile a soothing and plaintive chaunt, interlarded with endearing\r\nepithets, such as \"ho! my son,\" or \"ho! my father,\" or \"my mother,\" as\r\nmay be applicable to the age and sex of the captive. The elephant is at\r\nfirst furious, and strikes in all directions with his trunk; but the men\r\nin front receiving all these blows on the points of their weapons, the\r\nextremity of the trunk becomes so sore that the animal curls it up\r\nclose, and seldom afterwards attempts to use it offensively. The first\r\ndread of man's power being thus established, the process of taking him\r\nto bathe between two tame elephants is greatly facilitated, and by\r\nlengthening the neck rope, and drawing the feet together as close as\r\npossible, the process of laying him down in the water is finally\r\naccomplished by the keepers pressing the sharp point of their hendoos\r\nover the backbone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: BRODERIP, _Zoological Recreations_, p. 226.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The iron goad with which the keeper directs the movements\r\nof the elephants, called a _hendoo_ in Ceylon and _hawkus_ in Bengal,\r\nappears to have retained the present shape from the remotest antiquity.\r\nIt is figured in the medals of Caracalla in the identical form in which\r\nit is in use at the present day in India.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks called it [Greek: harpê], and the Romans _cuspis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Medal of Numidia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modern Hendoo.]]\r\n\r\nFor many days the roaring and resistance which attend the operation are\r\nconsiderable, and it often requires the sagacious interference of the\r\ntame elephants to control the refractory wild ones. It soon, however,\r\nbecomes practicable to leave the latter alone, only taking them to and\r\nfrom the stall by the aid of a decoy. This step lasts, under ordinary\r\ntreatment, for about three weeks, when an elephant may be taken alone\r\nwith his legs hobbled, and a man walking backwards in front with the\r\npoint of the hendoo always presented to the elephant's head, and a\r\nkeeper with an iron crook at each ear. On getting into the water, the\r\nfear of being pricked on his tender back induces him to lie down\r\ndirectly on the crook being only held over him _in terrorem_. Once this\r\npoint has been achieved, the further process of taming is dependent upon\r\nthe disposition of the creature.\r\n\r\nThe greatest care is requisite, and daily medicines are applied to heal\r\nthe fearful wounds on the legs which even the softest ropes occasion.\r\nThis is the great difficulty of training; for the wounds fester\r\ngrievously, and months and sometimes years will elapse before an\r\nelephant will allow his feet to be touched without indications of alarm\r\nand anger.\r\n\r\nThe observation has been frequently made that the elephants most vicious\r\nand troublesome to tame, and the most worthless when tamed, are those\r\ndistinguished by a thin trunk and flabby pendulous ears. The period of\r\ntuition does not appear to be influenced by the size or strength of the\r\nanimals: some of the smallest give the greatest amount of trouble;\r\nwhereas, in the instance of the two largest that have been taken in\r\nCeylon within the last thirty years, both were docile in a remarkable\r\ndegree. One in particular, which was caught and trained by Mr. Cripps,\r\nwhen Government agent, in the Seven Korles, fed from the hand the first\r\nnight it was secured, and in a very few days evinced pleasure on being\r\npatted on the head.[1] There is none so obstinate, not even a _rogue_,\r\nthat may not, when kindly and patiently treated, be conciliated and\r\nreconciled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This was the largest elephant that had been tamed in\r\nCeylon; he measured upwards of nine feet at the shoulders and belonged\r\nto the caste so highly prized for the temples. He was gentle after his\r\nfirst capture, but his removal from the corral to the stables, though\r\nonly a distance of six miles, was a matter of the extremest difficulty;\r\nhis extraordinary strength rendering him more than a match for the\r\nattendant decoys. He, on one occasion, escaped, but was recaptured in\r\nthe forest; and he afterwards became so docile as to perform a variety\r\nof tricks. He was at length ordered to be removed to Colombo; but such\r\nwas his terror on approaching the gate, that on coaxing him to enter the\r\ngate, he became paralysed in the extraordinary way elsewhere alluded to,\r\nand _died on the spot_.]\r\n\r\nThe males are generally more unmaneagable than the females, and in both\r\nan inclination to lie down to rest is regarded as a favourable symptom\r\nof approaching tractability, some of the most resolute having been known\r\nto stand for months together, even during sleep. Those which are the\r\nmost obstinate and violent at first are the soonest and most effectually\r\nsubdued, and generally prove permanently docile and submissive. But\r\nthose which are sullen or morose, although they may provoke no\r\nchastisement by their viciousness, are always slower in being taught,\r\nand are rarely to be trusted in after life.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The natives profess that the high caste elephants, such as\r\nare allotted to the temples, are of all others the most difficult to\r\ntame, and M. BLES, the Dutch correspondent of BUFFON, mentions a caste\r\nof elephants which he had heard of, as being peculiar to the Kandyan\r\nkingdom, that were not higher than a heifer (génisse), covered with\r\nhair, and insusceptible of being tamed. (BUFFON, _Supp._ vol. vi. p.\r\n29.) Bishop HEBER, in the account of his journey from Bareilly towards\r\nthe Himalayas, describes the Raja Gourman Sing, \"mounted on a little\r\nfemale elephant, hardly bigger than a Durham ox, and almost as shaggy as\r\na poodle.\"--_Journx._, ch. xvii. It will be remembered that the mammoth\r\ndiscovered in 1803 embedded in icy soil in Siberia, was covered with a\r\ncoat of long hair, with a sort of wool at the roots. Hence there arose\r\nthe question whether that northern region had been formerly inhabited by\r\na race of elephants, so fortified by nature against cold; or whether the\r\nindividual discovered had been borne thither by currents from some more\r\ntemperate latitudes. To the latter theory the presence of hair seemed a\r\nfatal objection; but so far as my own observation goes, I believe the\r\nelephants are more or less provided with hair. In some it is more\r\ndeveloped than in others, and it is particularly observable in the\r\nyoung, which when captured are frequently covered with a woolly fleece,\r\nespecially about the head and shoulders. In the older individuals in\r\nCeylon, this is less apparent: and in captivity the hair appears to be\r\naltogether removed by the custom of the mahouts to rub their skin daily\r\nwith oil and a rough lump of burned clay. See a paper on the subject,\r\n_Asiat. Journ._ N.S. vol. xiv. p. 182, by Mr. G. FAIRHOLME.]\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be its natural gentleness and docility, the temper of\r\nan elephant is seldom to be implicitly relied on in a state of captivity\r\nand coercion. The most amenable are subject to occasional fits of\r\nstubbornness; and even after years of submission, irritability and\r\nresentment will unaccountably manifest themselves. It may be that the\r\nrestraints and severer discipline of training have not been entirely\r\nforgotten; or that incidents which in ordinary health would be\r\nproductive of no demonstration whatever, may lead, in moments of\r\ntemporary illness, to fretfulness and anger. The knowledge of this\r\ninfirmity led to the popular belief recorded by PHILE, that the elephant\r\nhad _two hearts_, under the respective influences of which it evinced\r\nferocity of gentleness; subdued by the one to habitual tractability and\r\nobedience, but occasionally roused by the other to displays of rage and\r\nresistance.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1:\r\n  [Greek:\r\n  \"Diplês de phasin euporêsai kardias\r\n  Kai tê men einai thumikon to thêrion\r\n  Eis akratê kinêsin êrethismenon,\r\n  Tê de prosênes kai thrasytêtos xenon.\r\n  Kai pê men autôn akroasthai ton logôn\r\n  Ous an tis Indos eu tithaseuôn legoi,\r\n  Pê de pros autous tous nomeis epitrechein\r\n  Eis tas palaias ektrapen kakoupgias.\"]\r\n       PHILE, _Expos. de Eleph._, l. 126, &c.]\r\n\r\nIn the process of taming, the presence of the tame ones can generally be\r\ndispensed with after two months, and the captive may then be ridden by\r\nthe driver alone; and after three or four months he may be entrusted\r\nwith labour, so far as regards docility;--but it is undesirable, and\r\neven involves the risk of life, to work an elephant too soon; it has\r\nfrequently happened that a valuable animal has lain down and died the\r\nfirst time it was tried in harness, from what the natives believe to be\r\n\"broken heart,\"--certainly without any cause inferable from injury or\r\nprevious disease.[1] It is observable, that till a captured elephant\r\nbegins to relish food, and grow fat upon it, he becomes so fretted by\r\nwork, that it kills him in an incredibly short space of time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Captain YULE, in his _Narrative of an Embassy to Ava in_\r\n1855, records an illustration of this tendency of the elephant to sudden\r\ndeath; one newly captured, the process of taming which was exhibited to\r\nthe British Envoy, \"made vigorous resistance to the placing of a collar\r\non its neck, and the people were proceeding to tighten it, when the\r\nelephant, which had lain down as if quite exhausted, reared suddenly on\r\nthe hind quarters, and fell on its side--_dead_!\"--P. 104.\r\n\r\nMr. STRACHAN noticed the same liability of the elephants to sudden death\r\nfrom very slight causes; \"of the fall.\" he says, \"at any time, though on\r\nplain ground, they either die immediately, or languish till they die;\r\ntheir great weight occasioning them so much hurt by the fall.\"--_Phil.\r\nTrans._ A.D. 1701, vol. xxiii. p. 1052.]\r\n\r\nThe first employment to which an elephant is put is to tread clay in a\r\nbrick-field, or to draw a waggon in double harness with a tame\r\ncompanion. But the work in which the display of sagacity renders his\r\nlabours of the highest value, is that which involves the use of heavy\r\nmaterials; and hence in dragging and piling timber, or moving stones[1]\r\nfor the construction of retaining walls and the approaches to bridges,\r\nhis services in an unopened country are of the utmost importance. When\r\nroads are to be constructed along the face of steep declivities, and the\r\nspace is so contracted that risk is incurred either of the working\r\nelephant falling over the precipice or of rocks slipping down from\r\nabove, not only are the measures to which he resorts the most judicious\r\nand reasonable that could be devised, but if urged by his keeper to\r\nadopt any other, he manifests a reluctance sufficient to show that he\r\nhas balanced in his own mind the comparative advantages of each. An\r\nelephant appears on all occasions to comprehend the purpose and object\r\nthat he is expected to promote, and hence he voluntarily executes a\r\nvariety of details without any guidance whatever from his keeper. This\r\nis one characteristic in which this animal manifests a superiority over\r\nthe horse; although his strength in proportion to his weight is not so\r\ngreat as that of the latter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A correspondent informs me that on the Malabar coast of\r\nIndia, the elephant, when employed in dragging stones, moves them by\r\nmeans of a rope, which he either draws with his forehead, or manages by\r\nseizing it in his teeth.]\r\n\r\nHis minute motions when engrossed by such operations, the activity of\r\nhis eye, and the earnestness of his attitudes, can only be comprehended\r\nby being seen. In moving timber and masses of rock his trunk is the\r\ninstrument on which he mainly relies, but those which have tusks turn\r\nthem to good account. To get a weighty stone out of a hollow an elephant\r\nwill kneel down so as to apply the pressure of his head to move it\r\nupwards, then steadying it with one foot till he can raise himself, he\r\nwill apply a fold of his trunk to shift it to its place, and fit it\r\naccurately in position: this done, he will step round to view it on\r\neither side, and adjust it with due precision. He appears to gauge his\r\ntask by his eye, and to form a judgment whether the weight be\r\nproportionate to his strength. If doubtful of his own power, he\r\nhesitates and halts, and if urged against his will, he roars and shows\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\nIn clearing an opening through forest land, the power of the African\r\nelephant, and the strength ascribed to him by a recent traveller, as\r\ndisplayed in uprooting trees, have never been equalled or approached by\r\nanything I have seen of the elephant in Ceylon[1] or heard of them in\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Here the trees were large and handsome, but not strong\r\nenough to resist the inconceivable strength of the mighty monarch of\r\nthese forests; almost every tree had half its branches broken short by\r\nthem and at every hundred yards I came upon entire trees, and these,\r\n_the largest in the forest_, uprooted clean out of the ground, and\r\n_broken short across their stems_.\"--_A Hunter's Life in South Africa_.\r\nBy R. GORDON CUMMING, vol. ii. p. 305.--\r\n\r\n\"Spreading out from one another, they smash and destroy all the finest\r\ntrees in the forest which happen to be in their course.... I have rode\r\nthrough forests where the trees thus broken lay so thick across one\r\nanother, that it was almost impossible to ride through the\r\ndistrict.\"--_Ibid_., p. 310.\r\n\r\nMr. Gordon Cumming does not name the trees which he saw thus \"uprooted\"\r\nand \"broken across,\" nor has he given any idea of their size and weight;\r\nbut Major DENHAM, who observed like traces of the elephant in Africa,\r\nsaw only small trees overthrown by them; and Mr. PRINGLE, who had an\r\nopportunity of observing similar practices of the animals in the neutral\r\nterritory of the Eastern frontier of the Cape of Good Hope, describes\r\ntheir ravages as being confined to the mimosas, \"immense numbers of\r\nwhich had been torn out of the ground, and placed in an inverted\r\nposition, in order to enable the animals to browse at their ease on the\r\nsoft and juicy roots, which form a favourite part of their food. Many of\r\nthe _larger mimosas had resisted all their efforts; and indeed, it is\r\nonly after heavy rain, when the soil is soft and loose, that they ever\r\nsuccessfully attempt this operation._\"--Pringle's _Sketches of South\r\nAfrica._]\r\n\r\nOf course much must depend on the nature of the timber and the moisture\r\nof the soil; thus a strong tree on the verge of a swamp may be\r\noverthrown with greater ease than a small and low one in parched and\r\nsolid ground. I have seen no \"tree\" deserving the name, nothing but\r\njungle and brushwood, thrown down by the mere movement of an elephant\r\nwithout some special exertion of force. But he is by no means fond of\r\ngratuitously tasking his strength; and food being so abundant that he\r\nobtains it without an effort, it is not altogether apparent, even were\r\nhe able to do so, why he should assail \"the largest trees in the\r\nforest,\" and encumber his own haunts with their broken stems; especially\r\nas there is scarcely anything which an elephant dislikes more than\r\nventuring amongst fallen timber.\r\n\r\nA tree of twelve inches in diameter resisted successfully the most\r\nstrenuous struggles of the largest elephant I ever saw led to it; and\r\nwhen directed by their keepers to clear away jungle, the removal of even\r\na small tree, or a healthy young coco-nut palm, is a matter both of time\r\nand exertion. Hence the services of an elephant are of much less value\r\nin clearing a forest than in dragging and piling felled timber. But in\r\nthe latter occupation he manifests an intelligence and dexterity which\r\nis surprising to a stranger, because the sameness of the operation\r\nenables the animal to go on for hours disposing of log after log, almost\r\nwithout a hint or direction from his attendant. For example, two\r\nelephants employed in piling ebony and satinwood in the yards attached\r\nto the commissariat stores at Colombo, were so accustomed to their work,\r\nthat they were able to accomplish it with equal precision and with\r\ngreater rapidity than if it had been done by dock-labourers. When the\r\npile attained a certain height, and they were no longer able by their\r\nconjoint efforts to raise one of the heavy logs of ebony to the summit,\r\nthey had been taught to lean two pieces against the heap, up the\r\ninclined plane of which they gently rolled the remaining logs, and\r\nplaced them trimly on the top.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that in their occupations \"elephants are to a\r\nsurprising extent the creatures of habit,\"[1] that their movements are\r\naltogether mechanical, and that \"they are annoyed by any deviation from\r\ntheir accustomed practice, and resent any constrained departure from the\r\nregularity of their course.\" So far as my own observation goes, this is\r\nincorrect; and I am assured by officers of experience, that in regard to\r\nchanging his treatment, his hours, or his occupation, an elephant\r\nevinces no more consideration than a horse, but exhibits the same\r\npliancy and facility.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Menageries_, &c., \"The Elephant,\" vol. ii. p. 23.]\r\n\r\nAt one point, however, the utility of the elephant stops short. Such is\r\nthe intelligence and earnestness he displays in work, which he seems to\r\nconduct almost without supervision, that it has been assumed[1] that he\r\nwould continue his labour, and accomplish his given task, as well in the\r\nabsence of his keeper as during his presence. But here his innate love\r\nof ease displays itself, and if the eye of his attendant be withdrawn,\r\nthe moment he has finished the thing immediately in hand, he will stroll\r\naway lazily, to browse or enjoy the luxury of fanning himself and\r\nblowing dust over his back.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid._, ch. vi. p. 138.]\r\n\r\nThe means of punishing so powerful an animal is a question of difficulty\r\nto his attendants. Force being almost inapplicable, they try to work on\r\nhis passions and feelings, by such expedients as altering the nature of\r\nhis food or withholding it altogether for a time. Ou such occasions the\r\ndemeanour of the creature will sometimes evince a sense of humiliation\r\nas well as of discontent. In some parts of India it is customary, in\r\ndealing with offenders, to stop their allowance of sugar canes or of\r\njaggery; or to restrain them from eating their own share of fodder and\r\nleaves till their companions shall have finished; and in such cases the\r\nconsciousness of degradation betrayed by the looks and attitudes of the\r\nculprit is quite sufficient to identify him, and to excite a feeling of\r\nsympathy and pity.\r\n\r\nThe elephant's obedience to his keeper is the result of affection, as\r\nwell as of fear; and although his attachment becomes so strong that an\r\nelephant in Ceylon has been known to remain out all night, without food,\r\nrather than abandon his mahout, lying intoxicated in the jungle, yet he\r\nmanifests little difficulty in yielding the same submission to a new\r\ndriver in the event of a change of attendants. This is opposed to the\r\npopular belief that \"the elephant cherishes such an enduring remembrance\r\nof his old mahout, that he cannot easily be brought to obey a\r\nstranger.\"[1] In the extensive establishments of the Ceylon Government,\r\nthe keepers are changed without hesitation, and the animals, when\r\nequally kindly treated, are usually found to be as tractable and\r\nobedient to their new driver as to the old, in fact so soon as they have\r\nbecome familiarised with his voice. This is not, however, invariably the\r\ncase; and Mr. CRIPPS, who had remarkable opportunities for observing the\r\nhabits of the elephant in Ceylon, mentioned to me an instance in which\r\none of a singularly stubborn disposition occasioned some inconvenience\r\nafter the death of its keeper, by refusing to obey any other, till its\r\nattendants bethought them of a child about twelve years old, in a\r\ndistant village, where the animal had been formerly picketed, and to\r\nwhom it had displayed much attachment. The child was sent for: and on\r\nits arrival the elephant, as anticipated, manifested extreme\r\nsatisfaction, and was managed with ease, till by degrees it became\r\nreconciled to the presence of a new superintendent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Menageries, &c._, \"The Elephant,\" vol. i. p. 19.]\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the mahouts die young, owing to some supposed\r\ninjury to the spinal column from the peculiar motion of the elephant;\r\nbut this remark does not apply to those in Ceylon, who are healthy, and\r\nas long lived as other men. If the motion of the elephant be thus\r\ninjurious, that of the camel must be still more so; yet we never hear of\r\nearly death ascribed to this cause by the Arabs.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the keeper, with a very limited vocabulary of articulate\r\nsounds, serves almost alone to guide the elephant in his domestic\r\noccupations.[1] Sir EVERARD HOME, from an examination of the muscular\r\nfibres in the drum of an elephant's ear, came to the conclusion, that\r\nnotwithstanding the distinctness and power of his perception of sounds\r\nat a greater distance than other animals, he was insensible to their\r\nharmonious modulation and destitute of a musical ear.[2] But Professor\r\nHARRISON, in a paper read before the Royal Irish Academy in 1847, has\r\nstated that on a careful examination of the head of an elephant which he\r\nhad dissected, he could \"see no evidence of the muscular structure of\r\nthe _membrana tympani_ so accurately described by Sir E. HOME.\" Sir\r\nEVERARD'S deduction, I may observe, is clearly inconsistent with the\r\nfact that the power of two elephants may be combined by singing to them\r\na measured chant, somewhat resembling a sailor's capstan song; and in\r\nlabour of a particular kind, such as hauling a stone with ropes, they\r\nwill thus move conjointly a weight to which their divided strength would\r\nbe unequal.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The principal sound by which the mahouts in Ceylon direct\r\nthe motions of the elephants is a repetition, with various modulations,\r\nof the words _ur-re! ur-re!_ This is one of those interjections in which\r\nthe sound is so expressive of the sense that persons in charge of\r\nanimals of almost every description throughout the world appear to have\r\nadopted it with a concurrence that is very curious. The drivers of\r\ncamels in Turkey, Palestine, and Egypt encourage them to speed by\r\nshouting _ar-ré! ar-ré!_ The Arabs in Algeria cry _eirich!_ to their\r\nmules. The Moors seem to have carried the custom with them into Spain,\r\nwhere mules are still driven with cries of _arré_ (whence the muleteers\r\nderive their Spanish appellation of \"arrieros\"). In France the Sportsman\r\nexcites the hound by shouts of _hare! hare!_ and the waggoner there\r\nturns his horses by his voice, and the use of the word _hurhaut!_ In the\r\nNorth, \"_Hurs_ was a word used by the old Germans in urging their horses\r\nto speed;\" and to the present day, the herdsmen in Ireland, and parts of\r\nScotland, drive their pigs with shouts of _hurrish!_ a sound closely\r\nresembling that used by the mahouts in Ceylon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _On the Difference between the Human Membrana Tympani and\r\nthat of the Elephant_.

Royal Irish Academy, vol. iii. p. 386.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I have already noticed the striking effect produced on the\r\ncaptive elephants in the corral, by the harmonious notes of an ivory\r\nflute; and on looking to the graphic description which is given by ÆLIAN\r\nof the exploits which he witnessed as performed by the elephants\r\nexhibited at Rome, it is remarkable how very large a share of their\r\ntraining appears to have been ascribed to the employment of music.\r\n\r\nPHILE, in the account which he has given of the elephant's fondness for\r\nmusic, would almost seem to have versified the prose narrative of ÆLIAN,\r\nas he describes its excitement at the more animated portions, its step\r\nbeing regulated to the time and movements of the harmony: the whole\r\n\"_surprising in a creature whose limbs are without joints!_\r\n\r\n  [Greek:\r\n  \"Kainon ti poiôn ex anarthrôn organôn.\"]\r\n          PHILE, _Expos. de Eleph_, 1. 216.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the training and performances of the elephants at\r\nRome, as narrated by ÆLIAN see the appendix to this chapter.]\r\n\r\nNothing can more strongly exhibit the impulse to obedience in the\r\nelephant, than the patience with which, at the order of his keeper, he\r\nswallows the nauseous medicines of the native elephant-doctors; and it\r\nis impossible to witness the fortitude with which (without shrinking) he\r\nsubmits to excruciating surgical operations for the removal of tumours\r\nand ulcers to which he is subject, without conceiving a vivid impression\r\nof his gentleness and intelligence. Dr. DAVY when in Ceylon was\r\nconsulted about an elephant in the government Stud, which was suffering\r\nfrom a deep, burrowing sore in the back, just over the back-bone, which\r\nhad long resisted the treatment ordinarily employed. He recommended the\r\nuse of the knife, that issue might be given to the accumulated matter,\r\nbut no one of the attendants was competent to undertake the operation.\r\n\"Being assured,\" he continues, \"that the creature would behave well, I\r\nundertook it myself. The elephant was not bound, but was made to kneel\r\ndown at his keeper's command--and with an amputating knife, using all my\r\nforce, I made the incision required through the tough integuments. The\r\nelephant did not flinch, but rather inclined towards me when using the\r\nknife; and merely uttered a low, and as it were suppressed, groan. In\r\nshort, he behaved as like a human being as possible, as if conscious (as\r\nI believe he was), that the operation was for his good, and the pain\r\nunavoidable.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The _Angler in the Lake District_, p. 23.]\r\n\r\nObedience to the orders of his keepers is not, however, to be assumed as\r\nthe result of a uniform perception of the object to be attained by\r\ncompliance; and we cannot but remember the touching incident which took\r\nplace during the slaughter of the elephant at Exeter Change in 1846,\r\nwhen, after receiving ineffectually upwards of 120 balls in various\r\nparts of his body, he turned his face to his assailants on hearing the\r\nvoice of his keeper, and knelt down at the accustomed word of command,\r\nso as to bring his forehead within view of the rifles.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A shocking account of the death of this poor animal is\r\ngiven in HONE'S _Every-Day Book_, March, 1830, p. 337.]\r\n\r\nThe working elephant is always a delicate animal, and requires\r\nwatchfulness and care. As a beast of burden he is unsatisfactory; for\r\nalthough in point of mere strength there is scarcely any weight which\r\ncould be conveniently placed on him that he could not carry, it is\r\ndifficult to pack his load without causing abrasions that afterwards\r\nulcerate. His skin is easily chafed by harness, especially in wet\r\nweather. During either long droughts or too much moisture, his feet\r\nbecome liable to sores, that render him non-effective for months. Many\r\nattempts have been made to provide him with some protection for the sole\r\nof the foot, but from his extreme weight and peculiar mode of planting\r\nthe foot, they have all been unsuccessful. His eyes are also liable to\r\nfrequent inflammations, and the skill of the native elephant-doctors,\r\nwhich has been renowned since the time of Ælian, is nowhere more\r\nstrikingly displayed than in the successful treatment of such\r\nattacks.[1] In Ceylon, the murrain among cattle is of frequent\r\noccurrence, and carries off great numbers of animals, wild as well as\r\ntame. In such visitations the elephants suffer severely, not only those\r\nat liberty in the forest, but those carefully tended in the government\r\nstables. Out of a stud of about 40 attached to the department of the\r\nCommission of Roads, the deaths between 1841 and 1849 were on an average\r\n_four_ in each year, and this was nearly doubled in those years when\r\nmurrain prevailed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ÆLIAN, lib. xiii. c. 7.]\r\n\r\nOf 240 elephants, employed in the public departments of the Ceylon\r\nGovernment, which died in twenty-five years, from 1831 to 1856, the\r\nlength of time that each lived in captivity has only been recorded in\r\nthe instances of 138.

During training, many elephants die in\r\nthe unaccountable manner already referred to, of what the natives\r\ndesignate _a broken heart_.\r\n\r\nOn being first subjected to work, the elephant is liable to severe and\r\noften fatal swellings of the jaws and abdomen.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The elephant which was dissected by DR. HARRISON of Dublin,\r\nin 1847, died of a febrile attack, after four or five days' illness,\r\nwhich, as Dr. H. tells me in a private letter, was \"very like\r\nscarlatina, at that time a prevailing disease; its skin in some places\r\nbecame almost scarlet.\"]\r\n\r\n  From these causes there died, between 1841 and 1849    9\r\n  Of cattle murrain                                     10\r\n  Sore feet                                              1\r\n  Colds and inflammation                                 6\r\n  Diarrhoea                                              1\r\n  Worms                                                  1\r\n  Of diseased liver                                      1\r\n  Injuries from a fall                                   1\r\n  General debility                                       1\r\n  Unknown causes                                         3\r\n\r\nOf the entire, twenty-three were females and eleven males.\r\n\r\nThe ages of those that died could not be accurately stated, owing to the\r\ncircumstance of their having been captured in corral.

Towards keeping the stud in health, nothing has been found so\r\nconducive as regularly bathing the elephants, and giving them the\r\nopportunity to stand with their feet in water, or in moistened earth.\r\n\r\nElephants are said to be afflicted with tooth-ache; their tushes have\r\nlikewise been found with symptoms of internal perforation by some\r\nparasite, and the natives assert that, in their agony, the animals have\r\nbeen known to break them off short.[1] I have never heard of the teeth\r\nthemselves being so affected, and it is just possible that the operation\r\nof shedding the subsequent decay of the milk-tushes, may have in some\r\ninstances been accompanied by incidents that gave rise to this story.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See a paper entitled \"_Recollections of Ceylon_,\" in\r\n_Fraser's Magazine_ for December, 1860.]\r\n\r\nAt the same time the probabilities are in favour of its being true.\r\nCUVIER committed himself to the statement that the tusks of the elephant\r\nhave no attachments to connect them with the pulp lodged in the cavity\r\nat their base, from which the peculiar modification of dentine, known as\r\n\"ivory,\" is secreted[1]; and hence, by inference, that they would be\r\ndevoid of sensation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Annales du Muséum_ F. viii. 1805. p. 94, and _Ossemens\r\nFossiles_, quoted by OWEN, in the article on \"Teeth,\" in TODD'S _Cyclop.\r\nof Anatomy, &c_., vol. iv. p. 929.]\r\n\r\nBut independently of the fact that ivory in permeated by tubes so fine\r\nthat at their origin from the pulpy cavity they do not exceed 1/15000th\r\npart of an inch in diameter, OWEN had the tusk and pulp of the great\r\nelephant which died at the Zoological Gardens in London in 1847\r\nlongitudinally divided, and found that, \"although the pulp could be\r\neasily detached from the inner surface of the cavity, it was not without\r\na certain resistance; and when the edges of the co-adapted pulp and tusk\r\nwere examined by a strong lens, the filamentary processes from the outer\r\nsurface of the former could be seen stretching, as they were drawn from\r\nthe dentinal tubes, before they broke. These filaments are so minute, he\r\nadds, that to the naked eye the detached surface of the pulp seems to be\r\nentire; and hence CUVIER was deceived into supposing that there was no\r\norganic connexion between the pulp and the ivory. But if, as there seems\r\nno reason to doubt, these delicate nervous processes traverse the tusk\r\nby means of the numerous tubes already described, if attacked by caries\r\nthe pain occasioned to the elephant would be excruciating.\r\n\r\nAs to maintaining a stud of elephants for the purposes to which they are\r\nnow assigned in Ceylon, there may be a question on the score of prudence\r\nand economy. In the rude and unopened parts of the country, where rivers\r\nare to be forded, and forests are only traversed by jungle paths, their\r\nlabour is of value, in certain contingencies, in the conveyance of\r\nstores, and in the earlier operations for the construction of fords and\r\nrough bridges of timber. But in more highly civilised districts, and\r\nwherever macadamised roads admit of the employment of horses and oxen\r\nfor draught, I apprehend that the services of elephants might, with\r\nadvantage, be gradually reduced, if not altogether dispensed with.\r\n\r\nThe love of the elephant for coolness and shade renders him at all times\r\nmore or less impatient of work in the sun, and every moment of leisure\r\nhe can snatch is employed in covering his back with dust, or fanning\r\nhimself to diminish the annoyance of the insects and heat. From the\r\ntenderness of his skin and its liability to sores, the labour in which\r\nhe can most advantageously be employed is that of draught; but the\r\nreluctance of horses to meet or pass elephants renders it difficult to\r\nwork the latter with safety on frequented roads. Besides, were the full\r\nload which an elephant is capable of drawing, in proportion to his\r\nmuscular strength, to be placed upon waggons of corresponding dimension,\r\nthe to the roads would be such that the wear and tear of the highways\r\nand bridges would prove too costly to be borne. On the other hand, by\r\nrestricting it to a somewhat more manageable quantity, and by limiting\r\nthe weight, as at present, to about _one ton and a half_, it is doubtful\r\nwhether an elephant performs so much more work than could be done by a\r\nhorse or by bullocks, as to compensate for the greater cost of his\r\nfeeding and attendance.\r\n\r\nAdd to this, that from accidents and other causes, from ulcerations of\r\nthe skin, and illnesses of many kinds, the elephant is so often\r\ninvalided, that the actual cost of his labour, when at work, is very\r\nconsiderably enhanced. Exclusive of the salaries of higher officers\r\nattached to the government establishments, and other permanent charges,\r\nthe expenses of an elephant, looking only to the wages of his attendants\r\nand the cost of his food and medicines, varies from _three shillings to\r\nfour shillings and sixpence_, per diem, according to his size and\r\nclass.[1] Taking the average at three shillings and nine-pence, and\r\ncalculating that hardly any individual works more than four days out of\r\nseven, the charge for each day so employed would amount to _six\r\nshillings and sixpence_. The keep per day of a powerful dray-horse,\r\nworking five days in the week, would not exceed half-a-crown, and two\r\nsuch would unquestionably do more work than any elephant under the\r\npresent system. I do not know whether it be from a comparative\r\ncalculation of this kind that the strength of the elephant\r\nestablishments in Ceylon has been gradually diminished of late years,\r\nbut in the department of the Commissioner of Roads, the stud, which\r\nformerly numbered upwards of sixty elephants, was reduced, some years\r\nago, to thirty-six, and is at present less than half that number.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: An ordinary-sized elephant engrosses the undivided\r\nattention of _three_ men. One, as his mahout or superintendent, and two\r\nas leaf-cutters, who bring him branches and grass for his daily\r\nsupplies. An animal of larger growth would probably require a third\r\nleaf-cutter. The daily consumption is two cwt. of green food with about\r\nhalf a bushel of grain. When in the vicinity of towns and villages, the\r\nattendants have no difficulty in procuring an abundant supply of the\r\nbranches of the trees to which elephants are partial; and in journeys\r\nthrough the forests and unopened country, the leaf-cutters are\r\nsufficiently expert in the knowledge of those particular plants with\r\nwhich the elephant is satisfied. Those that would be likely to disagree\r\nwith him he unerringly rejects. His favourites are the palms, especially\r\nthe cluster of rich, unopened leaves, known as the \"cabbage,\" of the\r\ncoco-nut, and areca; and he delights to tear open the young trunks of\r\nthe palmyra and jaggery (_Caryota urens_) in search of the farinaceous\r\nmatter contained in the spongy pith. Next to these come the varieties of\r\nfig-trees. particularly the sacred _Bo_ (_F. religiosa_) which is found\r\nnear every temple, and the _na gaha_ (_Messua ferrea_), with thick dark\r\nleaves and a scarlet flower. The leaves of the Jak-tree and bread-fruit\r\n(_Artocarpus integrifolia_, and _A. incisa_), the Wood apple (_Ægle\r\nMarmelos_), Palu (_Mimusops Indica_), and a number of others well known\r\nto their attendants, are all consumed in turn. The stems of the\r\nplaintain, the stalks of the sugar-cane, and the feathery tops of the\r\nbamboos, are irresistible luxuries. Pine-apples, water-melons, and\r\nfruits of every description, are voraciously devoured, and a coco-nut\r\nwhen found is first rolled under foot to detach it from the husk and\r\nfibre, and then raised in his trunk and crushed, almost without an\r\neffort, by his ponderous jaws.\r\n\r\nThe grasses are not found in sufficient quantity to be an item of daily\r\nfodder; the Mauritius or the Guinea grass is seized with avidity; lemon\r\ngrass is rejected from its overpowering perfume, but rice in the straw,\r\nand every description of grain, whether growing or dry; gram (_Cicer\r\narietinum_), Indian Corn, and millet are his natural food. Of such of\r\nthese as can be found, it is the duty of the leaf-cutters, when in the\r\njungle and on march, to provide a daily supply.]\r\n\r\nThe fallacy of the supposed reluctance of the elephant to breed in\r\ncaptivity has been demonstrated by many recent authorities; but with the\r\nexception of the birth of young elephants at Rome, as mentioned by\r\nÆLIAN, the only instances that I am aware of their actually producing\r\nyoung under such circumstances, took place in Ceylon. Both parents had\r\nbeen for several years attached to the stud of the Commissioner of\r\nRoads, and in 1844 the female, whilst engaged in dragging a waggon, gave\r\nbirth to a still-born calf. Some years before, an elephant that had been\r\ncaptured by Mr. Cripps, dropped a female calf, which he succeeded in\r\nrearing. As usual, the little one became the pet of the keepers; but as\r\nit increased in growth, it exhibited the utmost violence when thwarted;\r\nstriking out with its hind-feet, throwing itself headlong on the ground,\r\nand pressing its trunk against any opposing object.\r\n\r\nThe duration of life in the elephant has been from the remotest times a\r\nmatter of uncertainty and speculation. Aristotle says it was reputed to\r\nlive from two to three hundred years[1], and modern zoologists have\r\nassigned to it an age very little less; CUVIER[2] allots two hundred and\r\nDE BLAINVILLE one hundred and twenty. The only attempt which I know of\r\nto establish a period historically or physiologically is that of\r\nFLEURENS, who has advanced an ingenious theory on the subject in his\r\ntreatise \"_De la Longévité Humaine_.\" He assumes the sum total of life\r\nin all animals to be equivalent to five times the number of years\r\nrequisite to perfect their growth and development;--and he adopts as\r\nevidence of the period at which growth ceases, the final consolidation\r\nof the bones with their _epiphyses_; which in the young consist of\r\ncartilages; but in the adult become uniformly osseous and solid. So long\r\nas the epiphyses are distinct from the bones, the growth of the animal\r\nis proceeding, but it ceases so soon as the consolidation is complete.\r\nIn man, according to FLEURENS, this consummation takes place at 20 years\r\nof age, in the horse at 5, in the dog at 2; so that conformably to this\r\ntheory the respective normal age for each would be 100 years for man, 25\r\nfor the horse, and 10 for a dog. As a datum for his conclusion, FLEURENS\r\ncites the instance of one young elephant in which, at 26 years old, the\r\nepiphyses were still distinct, whereas in another, which died at 31,\r\nthey were firm and adherent. Hence he draws the inference that the\r\nperiod of completed solidification is thirty years, and consequently\r\nthat the normal age of the elephant is _one hundred and fifty_.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ARISTOTELES _de Anim. l. viii._ c. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Menag. de Mus. Nat._ p. 107.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: FLEURENS, _De la Longévité Humaine_, pp. 82, 89.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the Singhalese the ancient fable of the elephant attaining to\r\nthe age of two or three hundred years still prevails; but the Europeans,\r\nand those in immediate charge of tame ones, entertain the opinion that\r\nthe duration of life for about _seventy_ years is common both to man and\r\nthe elephant; and that before the arrival of the latter period, symptoms\r\nof debility and decay ordinarily begin to manifest themselves. Still\r\ninstances are not wanting in Ceylon of trained decoys that have lived\r\nfor more than double the reputed period in actual servitude. One\r\nemployed by Mr. Cripps in the Seven Korles was represented by the\r\nCooroowe people to have served the king of Kandy in the same capacity\r\nsixty years before; and amongst the papers left by Colonel Robertson\r\n(son to the historian of \"Charles V.\"), who held a command in Ceylon in\r\n1799, shortly after the capture of the island by the British, I have\r\nfound a memorandum showing that a decoy was then attached to the\r\nelephant establishment at Matura, which the records proved to have\r\nserved under the Dutch during the entire period of their occupation\r\n(extending to upwards of one hundred and forty years); and it was said\r\nto have been found in the stables by the Dutch on the expulsion of the\r\nPortugese in 1656.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps from this popular belief in their almost illimitable age,\r\nthat the natives generally assert that the body of a dead elephant is\r\nseldom or never to be discovered in the woods. And certain it is that\r\nfrequenters of the forest with whom I have conversed, whether European\r\nor Singhalese, are consistent in their assurances that they have never\r\nfound the remains of an elephant that had died a natural death. One\r\nchief, the Wannyah of the Trincomalie district, told a friend of mine,\r\nthat once after a severe murrain, which had swept the province, he found\r\nthe carcases of elephants that had died of the disease. On the other\r\nhand, a European gentleman, who for thirty-six years without\r\nintermission has been living in the jungle, ascending to the summits of\r\nmountains in the prosecution of the trigonometrical survey, and\r\npenetrating valleys in tracing roads and opening means of\r\ncommunication,--one, too, who has made the habits of the wild elephant a\r\nsubject of constant observation and study,--has often expressed to me\r\nhis astonishment that after seeing many thousands of living elephants in\r\nall possible situations, he had never yet found a single skeleton of a\r\ndead one, except of those which had fallen by the rifle.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This remark regarding the elephant of Ceylon does not\r\nappear to extend to that of Africa, as I observe that BEAVER, in his\r\n_African Memoranda,_ says that \"the skeletons of old ones that have died\r\nin the woods are frequently found.\"--_African Memoranda relative to an\r\nattempt to establish British Settlements at the Island of Bulama_. Lond.\r\n1815, p. 353.]\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that the bones of the elephant, may be so porous\r\nand spongy as to disappear in consequence of an early decomposition; but\r\nthis remark would not apply to the grinders or to the tusks; besides\r\nwhich, the inference is at variance with the fact, that not only the\r\nhorns and teeth, but entire skeletons of deer, are frequently found in\r\nthe districts inhabited by the elephant.\r\n\r\nThe natives, to account for this popular belief, declare that the\r\nsurvivors of the herd bury such of their companions as die a natural\r\ndeath.[1] It is curious that this belief was current also amongst the\r\nGreeks of the Lower Empire; and PHILE, writing early in the fourteenth\r\ncentury, not only describes the younger elephants as tending the\r\nwounded, but as burying the dead:\r\n\r\n[Greek: \"Otan d' epistê tês teleutês o chronos Koinou telous amunan o\r\nxenos pherei].\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A corral was organised near Putlam in 1846, by Mr. Morris,\r\nthe chief officer of the district. It was constructed across one of the\r\npaths which the elephants frequent in their frequent marches, and during\r\nthe course of the proceedings two of the captured elephants died. Their\r\ncarcases were left of course within the enclosure, which was abandoned\r\nas soon as the capture was complete. The wild elephants resumed their\r\npath through it, and a few days afterwards the headman reported to Mr.\r\nMorris that the bodies had been removed and carried outside the corral\r\nto a spot to which nothing but the elephants could have borne them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: PHILE, _Expositio de Eleph._ l. 243.]\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese have a further superstition in relation to the close of\r\nlife in the elephant: they believe that, on feeling the approach of\r\ndissolution, he repairs to a solitary valley, and there resigns himself\r\nto death. A native who accompanied Mr. Cripps, when hunting, in the\r\nforests of Anarajapoora, intimated to him that he was then in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the spot \"_to which the elephants come to die_,\"\r\nbut that it was so mysteriously concealed, that although every one\r\nbelieved in its existence, no one had ever succeeded in penetrating to\r\nit. At the corral which I have described at Kornegalle, in 1847,\r\nDehigame, one of the Kandyan chiefs, assured me it was the universal\r\nbelief of his countrymen, that the elephants, when about to die,\r\nresorted to a valley in Saffragam, among the mountains to the east of\r\nAdam's Peak, which was reached by a narrow pass with walls of rock on\r\neither side, and that there, by the side of a lake of clear water, they\r\ntook their last repose.[1] It was not without interest that I afterwards\r\nrecognised this tradition in the story of _Sinbad of the Sea_, who in\r\nhis Seventh Voyage, after conveying the presents of Haroun al Raschid to\r\nthe king of Serendib, is wrecked on his return from Ceylon, and sold as\r\na slave to a master who employs him in shooting elephants for the sake\r\nof their ivory; till one day the tree on which he was stationed having\r\nbeen uprooted by one of the herd, he fell senseless to the ground, and\r\nthe great elephant approaching wound his trunk around him and carried\r\nhim away, ceasing not to proceed, until he had taken him to a place\r\nwhere, his terror having subsided, _he found himself amongst the bones\r\nof elephants, and knew that this was their burial place_.[2] It is\r\ncurious to find this legend of Ceylon in what has, not inaptly, been\r\ndescribed as the \"Arabian Odyssey\" of Sinbad; the original of which\r\nevidently embodies the romantic recitals of the sailors returning from\r\nthe navigation of the Indian Seas, in the middle ages[3], which were\r\ncurrent amongst the Mussulmans, and are reproduced in various forms\r\nthroughout the tales of the _Arabian Nights_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The selection by animals of a _place to die_, is not\r\nconfined to the elephant, DARWIN says, that in South America \"the\r\nguanacos (llamas) appear to have favourite spots for lying down to die;\r\non the banks of the Santa Cruz river, in certain circumscribed spaces\r\nwhich were generally bushy and all near the water, the ground was\r\nactually white with their bones; on one such spot I counted between ten\r\nand twenty heads.\"--_Nat. Voy._ ch. viii. The same has been remarked in\r\nthe Rio Gallegos; and at St. Jago in the Cape de Verde Islands, DARWIN\r\nsaw a retired corner similarly covered with the bones of the goat, as if\r\nit were \"the burial-ground of all the goats in the island.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Arabian Nights' Entertainment_, LANE'S edition, vol. iii.\r\np. 77.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See a disquisition on the origin of the story of Sinbad, by\r\nM. REINAUD, in the introduction prefixed to his translation of the\r\n_Arabian Geography of Aboulfeda_, vol. i. p. lxxvi.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs Ælian's work on the _Nature of Animals_ has never, I believe, been\r\nrepublished in any English version, and the passage in relation to the\r\ntraining and performance of elephants is so pertinent to the present\r\ninquiry, I venture to subjoin a translation of the 11th Chapter of his\r\n2nd Book.\r\n\r\n\"Of the cleverness of the elephant I have spoken elsewhere, and likewise\r\nof the manner of hunting. I have mentioned these things, a few out of\r\nthe many which others have stated; but for the present I purpose to\r\nspeak of their musical feeling, their tractability, and facility in\r\nlearning what it is difficult for even a human being to acquire, much\r\nless a beast, hitherto so wild:--such as to dance, as is done on the\r\nstage; to walk with a measured gait; to listen to the melody of the\r\nflute and to perceive the difference of sounds, that, being pitched low\r\nlead to a slow movement, or high to a quick one: all this the elephant\r\nlearns and understands, and is accurate withal, and makes no mistake.\r\nThus has Nature formed him not only the greatest in size, but the most\r\ngentle and the most easily taught. Now if I were going to write about\r\nthe tractability and aptitude to learn amongst those of India, Æthiopia,\r\nand Libya, I should probably appear to be concocting a tale and acting\r\nthe braggart, or to be telling a falsehood respecting the nature of the\r\nanimal founded on a mere report, all which it behoves a philosopher, and\r\nmost of all one who is an ardent lover of truth, not to do. But what I\r\nhave seen myself, and what others have described as having occurred at\r\nRome, this I have chosen to relate, selecting a few facts out of many,\r\nto show the particular nature of those creatures. The elephant when\r\ntamed is an animal most gentle and most easily led to do whatever he is\r\ndirected. And by way of showing honour to time, I will first narrate\r\nevents of the oldest date. Cæsar Germanicus, the nephew of Tiberius,\r\nexhibited once a public show, wherein there were many full-grown\r\nelephants, male and female, and some of their breed born in this\r\ncountry. When their limbs were beginning to become firm, a person\r\nfamiliar with such animals instructed them by a strange and surpassing\r\nmethod of teaching; using only gentleness and kindness, and adding to\r\nhis mild lessons the bait of pleasant and varied food. By this means he\r\nled them by degrees to throw off all wildness, and, as it were, to\r\ndesert to a state of civilisation, conducting themselves in a manner\r\nalmost human. He taught them neither to be excited on hearing the pipe,\r\nnor to be disturbed by the beat of drum, but to be soothed by the sounds\r\nof the reed, and to endure unmusical noises and the clatter of feet from\r\npersons while marching; and they were trained to feel no fear of a mass\r\nof men, nor to be enraged at the infliction of blows, not even when\r\ncompelled to twist their limbs and to bend them like a stage-dancer, and\r\nthis too although endowed with strength and might. And there is in this\r\na very noble addition to nature, not to conduct themselves in a\r\ndisorderly manner and disobediently towards the instructions of man; for\r\nafter the dancing-master had made them expert, and they had learnt their\r\nlessons accurately, they did not belie the labour of his instruction\r\nwhenever a necessity and opportunity called upon them to exhibit what\r\nthey had been taught. For the whole troop came forward from this and\r\nthat side of the theatre, and divided themselves into parties: they\r\nadvanced walking with a mincing gait and exhibiting in their whole body\r\nand persons the manners of a beau, clothed in the flowery dresses of\r\ndancers; and on the ballet-master giving a signal with his voice, they\r\nfell into line and went round in a circle, and if it were requisite to\r\ndeploy they did so. They ornamented the floor of the stage by throwing\r\nflowers upon it, and this they did in moderation and sparingly, and\r\nstraightway they beat a measure with their feet and kept time together.\r\n\r\n\"Now that Damon and Spintharus and Aristoxenus and Xenophilus and\r\nPhiloxenus and others should know music excellently well, and for their\r\ncleverness be ranked amongst the few, is indeed a thing of wonder, but\r\nnot incredible nor contrary at all to reason. For this reason that a man\r\nis a rational animal, and the recipient of mind and intelligence. But\r\nthat a jointless animal ([Greek: anarthron]) should understand rhythm\r\nand melody, and preserve a gesture, and not deviate from a measured\r\nmovement, and fulfil the requirements of those who laid down\r\ninstructions, these are gifts of nature, I think, and a peculiarity in\r\nevery way astounding. Added to these there were things enough to drive\r\nthe spectator out of his senses; when the strewn rushes and other\r\nmaterials for beds on the ground were placed on the sand of the theatre,\r\nand they received stuffed mattrasses such as belonged to rich houses and\r\nvariegated bed coverings, and goblets were placed there, very expensive,\r\nand bowls of gold and silver, and in them a great quantity of water; and\r\ntables were placed there of sweet-smelling wood and ivory very superb:\r\nand upon them flesh meats and loaves enough to fill the stomachs of\r\nanimals the most voracious. When the preparations were completed and\r\nabundant, the banqueters came forward, six male and an equal number of\r\nfemale elephants; the former had on a male dress, and the latter a\r\nfemale; and on a signal being given they stretched forward their trunks\r\nin a subdued manner, and took their food in great moderation, and not\r\none of them appeared to be gluttonous greedy, or to snatch at a greater\r\nportion, as did the Persian mentioned by Xenophon. And when it was\r\nrequisite to drink, a bowl was placed by the side of each; and inhaling\r\nwith their trunks they took a draught very orderly; and then they\r\nscattered the drink about in fun; but not as in insult. Many other acts\r\nof a similar kind, both clever and astonishing, have persons described,\r\nrelating to the peculiarities of these animals, and I saw them writing\r\nletters on Roman tablets with their trunks, neither looking awry nor\r\nturning aside. The hand, however, of the teacher was placed so as to be\r\na guide in the formation of the letters; and while it was writing the\r\nanimal kept its eye fixed down in an accomplished and scholarlike\r\nmanner.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nBIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the _Birds_ of the island, upwards of three hundred and twenty\r\nspecies have been indicated, for which we are indebted to the\r\npersevering labours of Dr. Templeton, Dr. Kelaart, and Mr. Layard; but\r\nmany yet remain to be identified. In fact, to the eye of a stranger,\r\ntheir prodigious numbers, and especially the myriads of waterfowl which,\r\nnotwithstanding the presence of the crocodiles, people the lakes and\r\nmarshes in the eastern provinces, form one of the marvels of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nIn the glory of their plumage, the birds of the interior are surpassed\r\nby those of South America and Northern India; and the melody of their\r\nsong bears no comparison with that of the warblers of Europe, but the\r\nwant of brilliancy is compensated by their singular grace of form, and\r\nthe absence of prolonged and modulated harmony by the rich and melodious\r\ntones of their clear and musical calls. In the elevations of the Kandyan\r\ncountry there are a few, such as the robin of Neuera-ellia[1] and the\r\nlong-tailed thrush[2], whose song rivals that of their European\r\nnamesakes; but, far beyond the attraction of their notes, the traveller\r\nrejoices in the flute-like voices of the Oriole, the Dayal-bird[3], and\r\nsome others equally charming; when at the first dawn of day, they wake\r\nthe forest with their clear _réveil_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pratincola atrata, _Kelaart_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Kittacincla macrura, _Gm_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Copsychussaularis, _Linn._. Called by the Europeans in\r\nCeylon the \"Magpie Robin.\" This is not to be confounded with the other\r\npopular favourite the \"Indian Robin\" (Thamnobia fulicata, _Linn._),\r\nwhich is \"never seen in the unfrequented jungle, but, like the coco-nut\r\npalm, which the Singhalese assert will only flourish within the sound of\r\nthe human voice, it is always found near the habitations of men.\"--E.L.\r\nLAYARD.]\r\n\r\nIt is only on emerging from the dense woods and coming into the vicinity\r\nof the lakes and pasture of the low country, that birds become visible\r\nin great quantities. In the close jungle one occasionally hears the call\r\nof the copper-smith[1], or the strokes of the great orange-coloured\r\nwoodpecker[2] as it beats the decaying trees in search of insects,\r\nwhilst clinging to the bark with its finely-pointed claws, and leaning\r\nfor support upon the short stiff feathers of its tail. And on the lofty\r\nbranches of the higher trees, the hornbill[3] (the toucan of the East),\r\nwith its enormous double casque, sits to watch the motions of the tiny\r\nreptiles and smaller birds on which it preys, tossing them into the air\r\nwhen seized, and catching them in its gigantic mandibles as they\r\nfall.[4] The remarkable excrescence on the beak of this extraordinary\r\nbird may serve to explain the statement of the Minorite friar Odoric, of\r\nPortenau in Friuli, who travelled in Ceylon in the fourteenth century,\r\nand brought suspicion on the veracity of his narrative by asserting that\r\nhe had there seen \"_birds with two heads_.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The greater red-headed Barbet (Megalaima indica, _Lath_.;\r\nM. Philippensis, _var. A. Lath_.), the incessant din of which resembles\r\nthe blows of a smith hammering a cauldron.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Brachypternus aurantius, _Linn._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Buceros pica, _Scop_.; B. Malaharicus, _Jerd_. The natives\r\nassert that B. pica builds in holes in the trees, and that when\r\nincubation has fairly commenced, the female takes her seat on the eggs,\r\nand the male closes up the orifice by which she entered, leaving only a\r\nsmall aperture through which he feeds his partner, whilst she\r\nsuccessfully guards their treasures from the monkey tribes; her\r\nformidable bill nearly filling the entire entrance. See a paper by Edgar\r\nL. Layard, Esq. _Mag. Nat. Hist._ March, 1853. Dr. Horsfield had\r\npreviously observed the same habit in a species of Buceros in Java. (See\r\nHORSFIELD and MOORE'S _Catal. Birds_, E.I. Comp. Mus. vol. ii.) It is\r\ncurious that a similar trait, though necessarily from very different\r\ninstincts, is exhibited by the termites, who literally build a cell\r\nround the great progenitrix of the community, and feed her through\r\napertures.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The hornbill is also frugivorous, and the natives assert\r\nthat when endeavouring to detach a fruit, if the stem is too tough to be\r\nsevered by his mandibles, he flings himself off the branch so as to add\r\nthe weight of his body to the pressure of his beak. The hornbill abounds\r\nin Cuttack, and bears there the name of \"Kuchila-Kai,\" or Kuchila-eater,\r\nfrom its partiality for the fruit of the Strychnus nuxvomica. The\r\nnatives regard its flesh as a sovereign specific for rheumatic\r\naffections.--_Asiat. Res._ ch. xv. p. 184.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Itinerarius_ FRATRIS ODORICI, de Foro Julii de\r\nPortu-vahonis, &c.--HAKLUYT, vol. ii. p. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HORNBILL.]\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese have a belief that the hornbill never resorts to the\r\nwater to drink; but that it subsists exclusively by what it catches in\r\nits prodigious bill while rain is falling. This they allege is\r\nassociated with the incessant screaming which it keeps up during\r\nshowers.\r\n\r\nAs we emerge from the dark shade, and approach park-like openings on the\r\nverge of the low country, quantities of pea-fowl are to be found either\r\nfeeding on the seeds among the long grass or sunning themselves on the\r\nbranches of the surrounding trees. Nothing to be met with in English\r\ndemesnes can give an adequate idea of the size and magnificence of this\r\nmatchless bird when seen in his native solitudes. Here he generally\r\nselects some projecting branch, from which his plumage may hang free of\r\nthe foliage, and, if there be a dead and leafless bough, he is certain\r\nto choose it for his resting-place, whence he droops his wings and\r\nsuspends his gorgeous train, or spreads it in the morning sun to drive\r\noff the damps and dews of the night.\r\n\r\nIn some of the unfrequented portions of the eastern province, to which\r\nEuropeans rarely resort, and where the pea-fowl are unmolested by the\r\nnatives, their number is so extraordinary that, regarded as game, it\r\nceases to be \"sport\" to destroy them; and their cries at early dawn are\r\nso tumultuous and incessant as to banish sleep, and amount to an actual\r\ninconvenience. Their flesh is excellent in flavour when served up hot,\r\nthough it is said to be indigestible; but, when cold, it contracts a\r\nreddish and disagreeable tinge.\r\n\r\nThe European fable of the jackdaw borrowing the plumage of the peacock,\r\nhas its counterpart in Ceylon, where the popular legend runs that the\r\npea-fowl stole the plumage of a bird called by the natives _avitchia_. I\r\nhave not been able to identify the species which bears this name; but it\r\nutters a cry resembling the word _matkiang!_ which in Singhalese means,\r\n\"I _will_ complain!\" This they believe is addressed by the bird to the\r\nrising sun, imploring redress for its wrongs. The _avitchia_ is\r\ndescribed as somewhat less than a crow, the colours of its plumage being\r\ngreen, mingled with red.\r\n\r\nBut of all, the most astonishing in point of multitude, as well as the\r\nmost interesting from their endless variety, are the myriads of aquatic\r\nbirds and waders which frequent the lakes and watercourses; especially\r\nthose along the coast near Batticaloa, between the mainland and the sand\r\nformations of the shore, and the innumerable salt marshes and lagoons to\r\nthe south of Trincomalie. These, and the profusion of perching birds,\r\nfly-catchers, finches, and thrushes, that appear in the open country,\r\nafford sufficient quarry for the raptorial and predatory\r\nspecies--eagles, hawks, and falcons--whose daring sweeps and effortless\r\nundulations are striking objects in the cloudless sky.\r\n\r\nI. ACCIPITRES. _Eagles_.--The Eagles, however, are small, and as\r\ncompared with other countries rare; except, perhaps, the crested\r\neagle[1], which haunts the mountain provinces and the lower hills,\r\ndisquieting the peasantry by its ravages amongst their poultry; and the\r\ngloomy serpent eagle[2], which, descending from its eyrie in the lofty\r\njungle, and uttering a loud and plaintive cry, sweeps cautiously around\r\nthe lonely tanks and marshes, to feed upon the reptiles on their margin.\r\nThe largest eagle is the great sea Erne[3], seen on the northern coasts\r\nand the salt lakes of the eastern provinces, particularly when the\r\nreceding tide leaves bare an expanse of beach, over which it hunts, in\r\ncompany with the fishing eagle[4], sacred to Siva. Unlike its\r\ncompanions, however, the sea eagle rejects garbage for living prey, and\r\nespecially for the sea snakes which abound on the northern coasts. These\r\nit seizes by descending with its wings half closed, and, suddenly\r\ndarting down its talons, it soars aloft again with its writhing\r\nvictim.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Spizaëtuslimnaëtus, _Horsf_. The race of these birds in the\r\nDeccan and Ceylon are rather more crested, originating the Sp.\r\nCristatellus, _Auct_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Which Gould believes to be the _Hæmatornis Bacha_, Daud.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Pontoaëtus leucogaster, _Gmel_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Haliastur Indus, _Bodd._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: E.L. Layard. Europeans have given this bird the name of the\r\n\"Brahminy Kite,\" probably from observing the superstitious feeling of\r\nthe natives regarding it, who believe that when two armies are about to\r\nengage, its appearance prognosticates victory to the party over whom it\r\nhovers.]\r\n\r\n_Hawks_.--The beautiful Peregrine Falcon[1] is rare, but the Kestrel[2]\r\nis found almost universally; and the bold and daring Goshawk[3] wherever\r\nwild crags and precipices afford safe breeding places. In the district\r\nof Anarajapoora, where it is trained for hawking, it is usual, in lieu\r\nof a hood, to darken its eyes by means of a silken thread passed through\r\nholes in the eyelids. The ignoble birds of prey, the Kites[4], keep\r\nclose by the shore, and hover round the returning boats of the fishermen\r\nto feast on the fry rejected from their nets.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Falco peregrinus, _Linn._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Tinnunculus alaudarius, _Briss._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Astur trivirgatus, _Temm._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Milvus govinda, _Sykes._ Dr. Hamilton Buchanan remarks that\r\nwhen gorged this bird delights to sit on the entablature of buildings,\r\nexposing its back to the hottest rays of the sun, placing its breast\r\nagainst the wall, and stretching out its wings _exactly as the Egyptian\r\nHawk is represented on the monuments_.]\r\n\r\n_Owls_.--Of the nocturnal accipitres the most remarkable is the brown\r\nowl, which, from its hideous yell, has acquired the name of the\r\n\"Devil-Bird.\"[1] The Singhalese regard it literally with horror, and its\r\nscream by night in the vicinity of a village is bewailed as the\r\nharbinger of impending calamity.[2] There is a popular legend in\r\nconnection with it, to the effect that a morose and savage husband, who\r\nsuspected the fidelity of his wife, availed himself of her absence to\r\nkill her child, of whose paternity he was doubtful, and on her return\r\nplaced before her a curry prepared from its flesh. Of this the unhappy\r\nwoman partook, till discovering the crime by finding the finger of her\r\ninfant, she fled in frenzy to the forest, and there destroyed herself.\r\nOn her death she was metamorphosed, according to the Buddhist belief,\r\ninto an _ulama_, or Devil-bird, which still at nightfall horrifies the\r\nvillagers by repeating the frantic screams of the bereaved mother in her\r\nagony.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Syrnium Indranee, _Sykes._ Mr. Blyth writes to me from\r\nCalcutta that there are some doubts about this bird. There would appear\r\nto be three or four distinguishable races, the Ceylon bird approximating\r\nmost nearly to that of the Malayan Peninsula.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"DEVIL BIRD.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The horror of this nocturnal scream was equally prevalent\r\nin the West as in the East. Ovid introduces it in his _Fasti_, L. vi. l.\r\n139; and Tibullus in his Elegies, L. i. El. 5. Statius says--\r\n\r\n  Nocturnæque gemunt striges, et feralla bubo\r\n  _Damna canens_.       Theb. iii. l. 511.\r\n\r\nBut Pliny, l. xi. c. 93, doubts as to what bird produced the sound;--and\r\nthe details of Ovid's description do not apply to an owl.\r\n\r\nMr. Mitford, of the Ceylon Civil Service, to whom I am indebted for many\r\nvaluable notes relative to the birds of the island, regards the\r\nidentification of the Singhalese Devil-Bird as open to similar doubt: he\r\nsays--\"The Devil-Bird is not an owl. I never heard it until I came to\r\nKornegalle, where it haunts the rocky hill at the back of\r\nGovernment-house. Its ordinary note is a magnificent clear shout like\r\nthat of a human being, and which can be heard at a great distance, and\r\nhas a fine effect in the silence of the closing night. It has another\r\ncry like that of a hen just caught, but the sounds which have earned for\r\nit its bad name, and which I have heard but once to perfection, are\r\nindescribable, the most appalling that can be imagined, and scarcely to\r\nbe heard without shuddering; I can only compare it to a boy in torture,\r\nwhose screams are being stopped by being strangled. I have offered\r\nrewards for a specimen, but without success. The only European who had\r\nseen and fired at one agreed with the natives that it is of the size of\r\na pigeon, with a long tail. I believe it is a Podargus or Night Hawk.\"\r\nIn a subsequent note he further says--\"I have since seen two birds by\r\nmoonlight, one of the size and shape of a cuckoo, the other a large\r\nblack bird, which I imagine to be the one which gives these calls.\"]\r\n\r\nII. PASSERES. _Swallows_.--Within thirty-five miles of Caltura, on the\r\nwestern coast, are inland caves, to which the Esculent Swift[1] resorts,\r\nand there builds the \"edible bird's nest,\" so highly prized in China.\r\nNear the spot a few Chinese immigrants have established themselves, who\r\nrent the nests as a royalty from the government, and make an annual\r\nexport of the produce. But the Swifts are not confined to this district,\r\nand caves containing them have been found far in the interior, a fact\r\nwhich complicates the still unexplained mystery of the composition of\r\ntheir nest; and, notwithstanding the power of wing possessed by these\r\nbirds, adds something to the difficulty of believing that it consists of\r\nglutinous material obtained from algæ.[2] In the nests brought to me\r\nthere was no trace of organisation; and the original material, whatever\r\nit be, is so elaborated by the swallow as to present somewhat the\r\nappearance and consistency of strings of isinglass. The quantity of\r\nthese nests exported from Ceylon is trifling.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Collocalia brevirostris, _McClell_.; C. nidifica, _Gray_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: An epitome of what has been written on this subject will be\r\nfound in _Dr. Horsfield's Catalogue_ of the Birds in the E.I. Comp.\r\nMuseum, vol. i. p. 101, &c. Mr. Morris assures me, that he has found the\r\nnests of the Esculent Swallow eighty miles distant from the sea.]\r\n\r\n_Kingfishers_.--In solitary places, where no sound breaks the silence\r\nexcept the gurgle of the river as it sweeps round the rocks, the lonely\r\nKingfisher, the emblem of vigilance and patience, sits upon an\r\noverhanging branch, his turquoise plumage hardly less intense in its\r\nlustre than the deep blue of the sky above him; and so intent is his\r\nwatch upon the passing fish that intrusion fails to scare him from his\r\npost.\r\n\r\n_Sun Birds_.--In the gardens the tiny Sun Birds[1] (known as the Humming\r\nBirds of Ceylon) hover all day long, attracted to the plants, over which\r\nthey hang poised on their glittering wings, and inserting their curved\r\nbeaks to extract the insects that nestle in the flowers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Nectarina Zeylanica, _Linn._]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most graceful of the birds of Ceylon in form and motions,\r\nand the most chaste in colouring, is the one which Europeans call \"the\r\nBird of Paradise,\"[1] and natives \"the Cotton Thief,\" from the\r\ncircumstance that its tail consists of two long white feathers, which\r\nstream behind it as it flies. Mr. Layard says:--\"I have often watched\r\nthem, when seeking their insect prey, turn suddenly on their perch and\r\n_whisk their long tails with a jerk_ over the bough, as if to protect\r\nthem from injury.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Tchitrea paradisi, _Linn._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TCHITREA PARADISI.]\r\n\r\nThe tail is sometimes brown, and the natives have the idea that the bird\r\nchanges its plumage at stated periods, and that the tail-feathers become\r\nwhite and brown in alternate years. The fact of the variety of plumage\r\nis no doubt true, but this story as to the alternation of colours in the\r\nsame individual requires confirmation.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The engraving of the Tchitrea given on page 244 is copied\r\nby permission from one of the splendid drawings in. MR. GOULD'S _Birds\r\nof India_.]\r\n\r\n_The Bulbul_.--The _Condatchee Bulbul_[1], which, from the crest on its\r\nhead, is called by the Singhalese the \"Konda Cooroola,\" or _Tuft bird_,\r\nis regarded by the natives as the most \"_game_\" of all birds; and\r\ntraining it to fight was one of the duties entrusted by the Kings of\r\nKandy to the Cooroowa, or Head-man, who had charge of the King's animals\r\nand Birds. For this purpose the Bulbul is taken from the nest as soon as\r\nthe sex is distinguishable by the tufted crown; and secured by a string,\r\nis taught to fly from hand to hand of its keeper. When pitted against an\r\nantagonist, such is the obstinate courage of this little creature that\r\nit will sink from exhaustion rather than release its hold. This\r\npropensity, and the ordinary character of its notes, render it\r\nimpossible that the Bulbul of India could be identical with the Bulbul\r\nof Iran, the \"Bird of a Thousand Songs,\"[2] of which, poets say that its\r\ndelicate passion for the rose gives a plaintive character to its note.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pycnonotus hæmorrhous, _Gmel_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Hazardasitaum\" the Persian name for the bulbul. \"The\r\nPersians,\" according to Zakary ben Mohamed al Caswini, \"say the bulbul\r\nhas a passion for the rose, and laments and cries when he sees it\r\npulled.\"--OUSELEY'S _Oriental Collections_, vol. i. p. 16. According to\r\nPallas it is the true nightingale of Europe, Sylvia luscinia, which the\r\nArmenians call _boulboul_, and the Crim-Tartars _byl-byl-i_.]\r\n\r\n_Tailor-Bird_.--_The Weaver-Bird_.--The tailor-bird[1] having completed\r\nher nest, sewing together leaves by passing through them a cotton thread\r\ntwisted by herself, leaps from branch to branch to testify her happiness\r\nby a clear and merry note; and the Indian weaver[2], a still more\r\ningenious artist, hangs its pendulous dwelling from a projecting bough;\r\ntwisting it with grass into a form somewhat resembling a bottle with a\r\nprolonged neck, the entrance being inverted, so as to baffle the\r\napproaches of its enemies, the tree snakes and other reptiles. The\r\nnatives assert that the male bird carries fire flies to the nest, and\r\nfastens them to its sides by a particle of soft mud;--Mr. Layard assures\r\nme that although he has never succeeded in finding the fire fly, the\r\nnest of the male bird (for the female occupies another during\r\nincubation) invariably contains a patch of mud on each side of the\r\nperch. Grass is apparently the most convenient material for the purposes\r\nof the Weaver-bird when constructing its nest, but other substances are\r\noften substituted, and some nests which I brought from Ceylon proved to\r\nbe formed with delicate strips from the fronds of the dwarf date-palm,\r\n_Phoenix paludosa_, which happened to grow near the breeding place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Orthotomus longicauda, _Gmel_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Ploceus baya, _Blyth_.; P. Philippinus, _Auct_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"CISSA PUELLA.\"]\r\n\r\nAmongst the birds of this order, one which, as far as I know, is\r\npeculiar to the island is _Layard's Mountain-jay_ (_Cissa puella_, Blyth\r\nand Layard), is distinguished not less by the beautiful blue colour\r\nwhich enlivens its plumage, than by the elegance of its form and the\r\ngrace of its attitudes. It frequents the hill country, and is found\r\nabout the mountain streams at Neuera-ellia, and elsewhere.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The engraving above is taken by permission of Mr. Gould\r\nfrom one of his drawings for his _Birds of India_.]\r\n\r\n_Crows_.--Of all the Ceylon birds of this order the most familiar and\r\nnotorious are the small glossy crows, whose shining black plumage shot\r\nwith blue has suggested the title of _Corvus splendens_.[1] They\r\nfrequent the towns in companies, and domesticate themselves in the close\r\nvicinity of every house; and it may possibly serve to account for the\r\nfamiliarity and audacity which they exhibit in their intercourse with\r\nmen, that the Dutch during their sovereignty in Ceylon, enforced severe\r\npenalties against any one killing a crow, under the belief that they\r\nwere instrumental in extending the growth of cinnamon by feeding on the\r\nfruit, and thus disseminating the undigested seed.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is another species, the _C. culminatus_, so called\r\nfrom the convexity of its bill; but though seen in the towns, it lives\r\nchiefly in the open country, and may be constantly observed wherever\r\nthere are buffaloes, perched on their backs and engaged, in company with\r\nthe small Minah (_Acridotheres tristis_), in freeing them from ticks.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: WOLF'S _Life and Adventures_, p. 117.]\r\n\r\nSo accustomed are the natives to their presence and exploits, that, like\r\nthe Greeks and Romans, they have made the movements of crows the basis\r\nof their auguries; and there is no end to the vicissitudes of good and\r\nevil fortune which may not be predicted from the direction of their\r\nflight, the hoarse or mellow notes of their croaking, the variety of\r\ntrees on which they rest, and the numbers in which they are seen to\r\nassemble.\r\n\r\nAll day long these birds are engaged in watching either the offal of the\r\noffices, or the preparation for meals in the dining-room: and as doors\r\nand windows are necessarily opened to relieve the heat, nothing is more\r\ncommon than the passage of a crow across the room, lifting on the wing\r\nsome ill-guarded morsel from the dinner-table. No article, however\r\nunpromising its quality, provided only it be portable, can with safety\r\nbe left unguarded in any apartment accessible to them. The contents of\r\nladies' work-boxes, kid gloves, and pocket handkerchiefs vanish\r\ninstantly if exposed near a window or open door. They open paper parcels\r\nto ascertain the contents; they will undo the knot on a napkin if it\r\nencloses anything eatable, and I have known a crow to extract the peg\r\nwhich fastened the lid of a basket in order to plunder the provender\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion a nurse seated in a garden adjoining a regimental\r\nmess-room, was terrified by seeing a bloody clasp-knife drop from the\r\nair at her feet; but the mystery was explained on learning that a crow,\r\nwhich had been watching the cook chopping mince-meat, had seized the\r\nmoment when his head was turned to carry off the knife.\r\n\r\nOne of these ingenious marauders, after vainly attitudinising in front\r\nof a chained watch-dog, that was lazily gnawing a bone, and after\r\nfruitlessly endeavouring to divert his attention by dancing before him,\r\nwith head awry and eye askance, at length flew away for a moment, and\r\nreturned bringing a companion which perched itself on a branch a few\r\nyards in the rear. The crow's grimaces were now actively renewed, but\r\nwith no better success, till its confederate, poising itself on its\r\nwings, descended with the utmost velocity, striking the dog upon the\r\nspine with all the force of its strong beak. The _ruse_ was successful;\r\nthe dog started with surprise and pain, but not quickly enough to seize\r\nhis assailant, whilst the bone he had been gnawing was snatched away by\r\nthe first crow the instant his head was turned. Two well-authenticated\r\ninstances of the recurrence of this device came within my knowledge at\r\nColombo, and attest the sagacity and powers of communication and\r\ncombination possessed by these astute and courageous birds.\r\n\r\nOn the approach of evening the crows near Colombo assemble in noisy\r\ngroups along the margin of the freshwater lake which surrounds the fort\r\non the eastern side; and here for an hour or two they enjoy the luxury\r\nof throwing the water over their shining backs, and arranging their\r\nplumage decorously, after which they disperse, each taking the direction\r\nof his accustomed quarters for the night.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A similar habit has been noticed in the damask Parrots of\r\nAfrica (_Palæornis fuscus_) which daily resort at the same hour to their\r\naccustomed pools to bathe.]\r\n\r\nDuring the storms which usher in the monsoon, it has been observed, that\r\nwhen coco-nut palms are destroyed by lightning, the effect frequently\r\nextends beyond a single tree, and from the contiguity and conduction of\r\nthe spreading leaves, or some other peculiar cause, large groups will be\r\naffected by a single flash, a few killed instantly, and the rest doomed\r\nto rapid decay. In Belligam Bay, a little to the east of Point-de-Galle,\r\na small island, which is covered with coco-nuts, has acquired the name\r\nof \"Crow Island,\" from being the resort of those birds, which are seen\r\nhastening towards it in thousands towards sunset. A few years ago,\r\nduring a violent storm of thunder, such was the destruction of the crows\r\nthat the beach for some distance was covered with a black line of their\r\nremains, and the grove on which they had been resting was to a great\r\nextent destroyed by the same flash.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Similar instances are recorded in other countries of sudden\r\nand prodigious mortality amongst crows; but whether occasioned by\r\nlightning seems uncertain. In 1839 thirty-three thousand dead crows were\r\nfound on the shores of a lake in the county Westmeath in Ireland after a\r\nstorm.--THOMPSON'S _Nat. Hist. Ireland_, vol. i. p. 319. PATTERSON in\r\nhis _Zoology_, p. 356, mentions other cases.]\r\n\r\nIII. SCANSORES. _Parroquets_.--Of the Psittacidæ the only examples are\r\nthe parroquets, of which the most renowned is the _Palæornis Alexandri_,\r\nwhich has the historic distinction of bearing the name of the great\r\nconqueror of India, having been the first of its race introduced to the\r\nknowledge of Europe on the return of his expedition. An idea of their\r\nnumber may be formed from the following statement of Mr. Layard, as to\r\nthe multitudes which are to be found on the western coast. \"At Chilaw, I\r\nhave seen such vast flights of parroquets hurrying towards the coco-nut\r\ntrees which overhang the bazaar, that their noise drowned the Babel of\r\ntongues bargaining for the evening provisions. Hearing of the swarms\r\nthat resorted to this spot, I posted myself on a bridge some half mile\r\ndistant, and attempted to count the flocks which came from a single\r\ndirection to the eastward. About four o'clock in the afternoon,\r\nstraggling parties began to wend towards home, and in the course of half\r\nan hour the current fairly set in. But I soon found that I had no longer\r\ndistinct flocks to count, it became one living screaming stream. Some\r\nflew high in the air till right above their homes, and dived abruptly\r\ndownward with many evolutions till on a level with the trees; others\r\nkept along the ground and dashed close by my face with the rapidity of\r\nthought, their brilliant plumage shining with an exquisite lustre in the\r\nsun-light. I waited on the spot till the evening closed, when I could\r\nhear, though no longer distinguish, the birds fighting for their\r\nperches, and on firing a shot they rose with a noise like the 'rushing\r\nof a mighty wind,' but soon settled again, and such a din commenced as I\r\nshall never forget; the shrill screams of the birds, the fluttering of\r\ntheir innumerable wings, and the rustling of the leaves of the palm\r\ntrees was almost deafening, and I was glad at last to escape to the\r\nGovernment Rest House.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Annals of Nat. Hist._ vol. xiii. p. 263.]\r\n\r\nIV. COLUMBIDÆ. _Pigeons_.--Of pigeons and doves there are at least a\r\ndozen species. Some live entirely on trees[1], never alighting on the\r\nground; others, notwithstanding the abundance of food and warmth, are\r\nmigratory[2], allured, as the Singhalese allege, by the ripening of the\r\ncinnamon berries, and hence one species is known in the southern\r\nprovinces as the \"Cinnamon Dove.\" Others feed on the fruits of the\r\nbanyan: and it is probably to their instrumentality that this marvellous\r\ntree chiefly owes its diffusion, its seeds being carried by them to\r\nremote localities. A very beautiful pigeon, peculiar to the mountain\r\nrange, discovered in the lofty trees at Neuera-ellia, has, in compliment\r\nto the Viscountess Torrington, been named _Carpophaga Torringtoniæ_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Treron bicincta. _Jerd_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Alsocomus puniceus_, the \"Season Pigeon\" of Ceylon, so\r\ncalled from its periodical arrival and departure.]\r\n\r\nAnother, called by the natives _neela-cobeya_[1], although strikingly\r\nelegant both in shape and colour, is still more remarkable for the\r\nsingularly soothing effect of its low and harmonious voice. A gentleman\r\nwho has spent many years in the jungle, in writing to me of this bird\r\nand of the effects of its melodious song, says, that \"its soft and\r\nmelancholy notes, as they came from some solitary place in the forest,\r\nwere the most gentle sounds I ever listened to. Some sentimental smokers\r\nassert that the influence of the propensity is to make them feel _as if\r\nthey could freely forgive all who had ever offended them_; and I can say\r\nwith truth such has been the effect on my own nerves of the plaintive\r\nmurmurs of the neela-cobeya, that sometimes, when irritated, and not\r\nwithout reason, by the perverseness of some of my native followers, the\r\nfeeling has almost instantly subsided into placidity on suddenly hearing\r\nthe loving tones of these beautiful birds.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Chalcophaps Indicus, _Linn._]\r\n\r\nV. GALLINÆ. _The Ceylon Jungle-fowl_.--The jungle-fowl of Ceylon[1] is\r\nshown by the peculiarity of its plumage to be not only distinct from the\r\nIndian species, but peculiar to the island. It has never yet bred or\r\nsurvived long in captivity, and no living specimens have been\r\nsuccessfully transmitted to Europe. It abounds in all parts of the\r\nisland, but chiefly in the lower ranges of mountains; and one of the\r\nvivid memorials which are associated with our journeys through the\r\nhills, is its clear cry, which sounds like a person calling \"George\r\nJoyce,\"[2] and rises at early morning amidst mist and dew, giving life\r\nto the scenery, that has scarcely yet been touched by the sun-light.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gallus Lafayetti, _Lesson_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: I apprehend that in the particular of the peculiar cry the\r\nCeylon jungle fowl differs from that of the Dekkan, where _I am told_\r\nthat it crows like a bantam cock.]\r\n\r\nThe female of this handsome bird was figured many years ago by Dr. GRAY\r\nin his illustrations of \"_Indian Zoology_,\" under the name of _G.\r\nStanleyi_. The cock bird subsequently received from LESSON, the name by\r\nwhich the species is now known: but its habitat was not discovered,\r\nuntil a specimen having been forwarded from Ceylon to Calcutta, Dr.\r\nBLYTH recognised it as the long-sought-for male of Dr. Gray's specimen.\r\n\r\nAnother of the Gallinæ of Ceylon, remarkable for the delicate\r\npencillings of its plumage, as well as for the peculiarity of the double\r\nspur, from which it has acquired its trivial name, is the _Galloperdix\r\nbicalcaratus_, of which a figure is given from a drawing by Mr. Gould.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GALLOPERDIX BICALCARATUS.]\r\n\r\nVI. GRALLÆ.--On reaching the marshy plains and shallow lagoons on either\r\nside of the island, the astonishment of the stranger is excited by the\r\nendless multitudes of stilt-birds and waders which stand in long array\r\nwithin the wash of the water, or sweep in vast clouds above it.\r\nIbises[1], storks[2], egrets, spoonbills[3], herons[4], and the smaller\r\nraces of sand larks and plovers, are seen busily traversing the wet\r\nsand, in search of the red worm which burrows there, or peering with\r\nsteady eye to watch the motions of the small fry and aquatic insects in\r\nthe ripple on the shore.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Tantalus leucocephalus, and Ibis falcinellus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The violet-headed Stork (Ciconia leticocephala).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Platalea leucorodia, _Linn._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Ardea cinerea. A. purpurea.]\r\n\r\nVII. ANSERES.--Preeminent in size and beauty, the tall _flamingoes_[1],\r\nwith rose-coloured plumage, line the beach in long files. The Singhalese\r\nhave been led, from their colour and their military order, to designate\r\nthem the \"_English Soldier birds_.\" Nothing can be more startling than\r\nthe sudden flight of these splendid creatures when alarmed; their strong\r\nwings beating the air with a sound like distant thunder; and as they\r\nsoar over head, the flock which appeared almost white but a moment\r\nbefore, is converted into crimson by the sudden display of the red\r\nlining of their wings. A peculiarity in the beak of this bird has\r\nscarcely attracted the attention it merits, as a striking illustration\r\nof creative wisdom in adapting the organs of animals to their local\r\nnecessities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLAMINGO.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Phoenicopterus roseus, _Pallas_.]\r\n\r\nThe upper mandible, which is convex in other birds, is flattened in the\r\nflamingo, whilst the lower, instead of being flat, is convex. To those\r\nwho have had an opportunity of witnessing the action of the bird in its\r\nnative haunts, the expediency of this arrangement is at once apparent.\r\nTo counteract the extraordinary length of its legs, it is provided with\r\na proportionately long neck, so that in feeding in shallow water the\r\ncrown of the head becomes inverted and the upper mandible brought into\r\ncontact with the bottom; where its flattened surface qualifies it for\r\nperforming the functions of the lower one in birds of the same class;\r\nand the edges of both being laminated, it is thus enabled, like the\r\nduck, by the aid of its fleshy tongue, to sift before swallowing its\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nFloating on the surface of the deeper water, are fleets of the Anatidæ,\r\nthe Coromandel teal[1], the Indian hooded gull[2], the Caspian tern, and\r\na countless variety of ducks and smaller fowl--pintails[3], teal[4],\r\nred-crested pochards[5], shovellers[6], and terns.[7] Pelicans[8] in\r\ngreat numbers resort to the mouths of the rivers, taking up their\r\nposition at sunrise on some projecting rock, from which to dart on the\r\npassing fish, and returning far inland at night to their retreats among\r\nthe trees, which overshadow some solitary river or deserted tank.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Nettapus coromandelianus, _Gm_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Larus brunnicephalus, _Jerd_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Dafila acuta, _Linn._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Querquedula creeca, _Linn._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Fuligula rufina, _Pallas_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Spatula clypeata, _Linn._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Sterna minuta, _Linn._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Pelicanus Philippensis, _Gmel_.]\r\n\r\nI chanced upon one occasion to come unexpectedly upon one of these\r\nremarkable breeding places during a visit which I made to the great tank\r\nof Padivil, one of those gigantic constructions by which the early kings\r\nof Ceylon have left imperishable records of their reigns.\r\n\r\nIt is situated in the depth of the forests to the north-west of\r\nTrincomalie; and the tank is itself the basin of a broad and shallow\r\nvalley, enclosed between two lines of low hills, that gradually sink\r\ninto the plain as they approach towards the sea. The extreme breadth of\r\nthe included space may be twelve or fourteen miles, narrowing to eleven\r\nat the spot where the retaining bund has been constructed across the\r\nvalley; and when this enormous embankment was in effectual repair, and\r\nthe reservoir filled by the rains, the water must have been thrown back\r\nalong the basin of the valley for at least fifteen miles. It is\r\ndifficult now to determine the precise distances, as the overgrowth of\r\nwood and jungle has obliterated all lines left by the original level of\r\nthe lake at its junction with the forest. Even when we rode along it,\r\nthe centre of the tank was deeply submerged, so that notwithstanding the\r\npartial escape, the water still covered an area of ten miles in\r\ndiameter. Even now its depth when full must be very considerable, for\r\nhigh on the branches of the trees that grow in the area, the last flood\r\nhad left quantities of driftwood and withered grass; and the rocks and\r\nbanks were coated with the yeasty foam, that remains after the\r\nsubsidence of an agitated flood.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the tank was difficult to ride over, being still soft and\r\ntreacherous, although covered everywhere with tall and waving grass; and\r\nin every direction it was poched into deep holes by the innumerable\r\nelephants that had congregated to roll in the soft mud, to bathe in the\r\ncollected water, or to luxuriate in the rich herbage, under the cool\r\nshade of the trees. The ground, too, was thrown up into hummocks like\r\ngreat molehills which, the natives told us, were formed by a huge\r\nearthworm, common in Ceylon, nearly two feet in length, and as thick as\r\na small snake. Through these inequalities the water was still running\r\noff in natural drains towards the great channel in the centre, that\r\nconducts it to the broken sluice; and across these it was sometimes\r\ndifficult to find a safe footing for our horses.\r\n\r\nIn a lonely spot, towards the very centre of the tank, we came\r\nunexpectedly upon an extraordinary scene. A sheet of still water, two or\r\nthree hundred yards broad, and about half a mile long, was surrounded by\r\na line of tall forest-trees, whose branches stretched above its margin.\r\nThe sun had not yet risen, when we perceived some white objects in large\r\nnumbers on the tops of the trees; and as we came nearer, we discovered\r\nthat a vast colony of pelicans had formed their settlement and\r\nbreeding-place in this solitary retreat. They literally covered the\r\ntrees in hundreds; and their heavy nests, like those of the swan,\r\nconstructed of large sticks, forming great platforms, were sustained by\r\nthe horizontal branches. Each nest contained three eggs, rather larger\r\nthan those of a goose; and the male bird stood placidly beside the\r\nfemale as she sat upon them.\r\n\r\nNor was this all; along with the pelicans prodigious numbers of other\r\nwater-birds had selected this for their dwelling-place, and covered the\r\ntrees in thousands, standing on the topmost branches; tall flamingoes,\r\nherons, egrets, storks, ibises, and other waders. We had disturbed them\r\nthus early, before their habitual hour for betaking themselves to their\r\nfishing-fields. By degrees, as the light increased, we saw them\r\nbeginning to move upon the trees; they looked around them on every side,\r\nstretched their awkward legs behind them, extended their broad wings,\r\ngradually rose in groups, and slowly soared away in the direction of the\r\nseashore.\r\n\r\nThe pelicans were apparently later in their movements; they allowed us\r\nto approach as near them as the swampy nature of the soil would permit;\r\nand even when a gun was discharged amongst them, only those moved off\r\nwhich the particles of shot disturbed. They were in such numbers at this\r\nfavourite place; that the water over which they had taken up their\r\nresidence was swarming with crocodiles, attracted by the frequent fall\r\nof the young birds; and the natives refused, from fear of them, to wade\r\nin for one of the larger pelicans which had fallen, struck by a rifle\r\nball. It was altogether a very remarkable sight.\r\n\r\nOf the birds familiar to European sportsmen, partridges and quails are\r\nto be had at all times; the woodcock has occasionally been shot in the\r\nhills, and the ubiquitous snipe, which arrives in September from\r\nSouthern India, is identified not alone by the eccentricity of its\r\nflight, but by retaining in high perfection the qualities which have\r\nendeared it to the gastronome at home. But the magnificent pheasants,\r\nwhich inhabit the Himalayan range and the woody hills of the Chin-Indian\r\npeninsula, have no representative amongst the tribes that people the\r\nwoods of Ceylon; although a bird believed to be a pheasant has more than\r\nonce been seen in the jungle, close to Rangbodde, on the road to\r\nNeuera-ellia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_List of Ceylon Birds_.\r\n\r\nIn submitting this Catalogue of the birds of Ceylon, I am anxious to\r\nstate that the copious mass of its contents is mainly due to the\r\nuntiring energy and exertions of my friend, Mr. E.L. Layard. Nearly\r\nevery bird in the list has fallen by his gun; so that the most ample\r\nfacilities have been thus provided, not only for extending the limited\r\namount of knowledge which formerly existed on this branch of the zoology\r\nof the island; but for correcting, by actual comparison with recent\r\nspecimens, the errors which had previously prevailed as to imperfectly\r\ndescribed species.

some\r\nfuture day that some included in it have a wider geographical range.\r\n\r\nHæmatornis spilogaster. The \"Ceylon eagle;\" was discovered by Mr. Layard\r\nin the Wanny, and by Dr. Kelaart at Trincomalie.\r\n\r\nAthene castonotus. The chestnut-winged hawk owl. This pretty little owl\r\nwas added to the list of Ceylon birds by Dr. Templeton. Mr. Blyth is at\r\npresent of opinion that this bird is identical with Ath. Castanopterus,\r\n_Horsf_. of Java as figured by Temminck: _P. Col._\r\n\r\nBatrachostomus moniliger. The oil bird; was discovered amongst the\r\nprecipitous rocks of the Adam's Peak range by Mr. Layard. Another\r\nspecimen was sent about the same time to Sir James Emerson Tennent from\r\nAvisavelle. Mr. Mitford has met with it at Ratnapoora.\r\n\r\nCaprimulgus Kelaarti. Kelaart's nightjar; swarms on the marshy plains of\r\nNeuera-ellia at dusk.\r\n\r\nHirundo hyperythra. The red-bellied swallow; was discovered in 1849, by\r\nMr. Layard at Ambepusse. They build a globular nest, with a round hole\r\nat top. A pair built in the ring for a hanging lamp in Dr. Gardner's\r\nstudy at Peradenia, and hatched their young, undisturbed by the daily\r\ntrimming and lighting of the lamp.\r\n\r\nCisticola omalura. Layard's mountain grass warbler; is found in\r\nabundance on Horton Plain and Neuera-ellia, among the long Patena grass.\r\n\r\nDrymoica valida. Layard's wren-warbler; frequents tufts of grass and low\r\nbushes, feeding on insects.\r\n\r\nPratincola atrata. The Neuera-ellia robin; a melodious songster; added\r\nto our catalogue by Dr. Kelaart.\r\n\r\nBrachypteryx Palliseri. Ant thrush. A rare bird, added by Dr. Kelaart\r\nfrom Dimboola and Neuera-ellia.\r\n\r\nPellorneum fuscocapillum. Mr. Layard found two specimens of this rare\r\nthrush creeping about shrubs and bushes, feeding on insects.\r\n\r\nAlcippe nigrifrons. This thrush frequents low impenetrable thickets, and\r\nseems to be widely distributed.\r\n\r\nOreocincla spiloptera. The spotted thrush is only found in the mountain\r\nzone about lofty trees.\r\n\r\nMerula Kinnisii. The Neuera-ellia blackbird; was added by Dr. Kelaart.\r\n\r\nGarrulax cinereifrons. The ashy-headed babbler; was found by Mr. Layard\r\nnear Ratnapoora.\r\n\r\nPomatorhinus melanurus. Mr. Layard states that the mountain babbler\r\nfrequents low, scraggy, impenetrable brush, along the margins of\r\ndeserted cheena land. This may turn out to be little more than a local\r\nyet striking variety of P. Horsfieldii of the Indian Peninsula.\r\n\r\nMalacocercus rufescens. The red dung thrush added by Dr. Templeton to\r\nthe Singhalese Fauna, is found in thick jungle in the southern and\r\nmidland districts.\r\n\r\nPycnonotus penicillatus. The yellow-eared bulbul; was found by Dr.\r\nKelaart at Neuera-ellia.\r\n\r\nButalis Muttui. This very handsome flycatcher was procured at Point\r\nPedro, by Mr. Layard.\r\n\r\nDicrurus edoliformis. Dr. Templeton found this kingcrow at the Bibloo\r\nOya. Mr. Layard has since got it at Ambogammoa.\r\n\r\nDicrurus leucopygialis. The Ceylon kingcrow was sent to Mr. Blyth from\r\nthe vicinity of Colombo, by Dr. Templeton. A species very closely allied\r\nto D. coerulescens of the Indian continent.\r\n\r\nTephrodornis affinis. The Ceylon butcher-bird. A migatory species found\r\nin the wooded grass lands in October.\r\n\r\nCissa puella. Layard's mountain jay. A most lovely bird, found along\r\nmountain streams at Neuera-ellia and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nEulabes ptilogenys. Templeton's mynah. The largest and most beautiful of\r\nthe species. It is found in flocks perching on the highest trees,\r\nfeeding on berries.\r\n\r\nMunia Kelaarti. This Grosbeak previously assumed to be M. pectoralls of\r\nJerdon; is most probably peculiar to Ceylon.\r\n\r\nLoriculus asiaticus. The small parroquet, abundant in various districts.\r\n\r\nPalæornis Calthropæ. Layard's purple-headed parroquet, found at Kandy,\r\nis a very handsome bird, flying in flocks, and resting on the summits of\r\nthe very highest trees. Dr. Kelaart states that it is the only parroquet\r\nof the Neuera-ellia range.\r\n\r\nMegalaima flavifrons. The yellow-headed barbet, is not uncommon.\r\n\r\nMegalaima rubricapilla, is found in most parts of the island.\r\n\r\nPicus gymnophthalmus. Layard's woodpecker. The smallest of the species,\r\nwas discovered near Colombo, amongst jak-trees.\r\n\r\nBrachypternus Ceylonus. The Ceylon woodpecker, is found in abundance\r\nnear Neuera-ellia.\r\n\r\nBrachypternus rubescens. The red woodpecker.\r\n\r\nCentropus chlororhynchus. The yellow-billed cuckoo, was detected by Mr.\r\nLayard in dense jungle near Colombo and Avisavelle.\r\n\r\nPhoenicophaus pyrrhocephalus. The malkoha, is confined to the southern\r\nhighlands.\r\n\r\nTreron Pompadoura. The Pompadour pigeon. \"The Prince of Canino has shown\r\nthat this is a totally distinct bird from Tr. flavogularis, with which\r\nit was confounded: it is much smaller, with the quantity of maroon\r\ncolour on the mantle greatly reduced.\"--Paper by Mr. BLYTH, _Mag. Nat.\r\nHist._ p. 514: 1857.\r\n\r\nCarpophaga Torringtoniæ. Lady Torrington's pigeon; a very handsome\r\npigeon discovered in the highlands by Dr. Kelaart. It flies high in long\r\nsweeps, and makes its nest on the loftiest trees. Mr. Blyth is of\r\nopinion that it is no more than a local race, barely separable from C.\r\nElphinstonii of the Nilgiris and Malabar coast.\r\n\r\nCarpophaga pusilla. The little-hill dove a migratory species found by\r\nMr. Layard in the mountain zone, only appearing with the ripened fruit\r\nof the teak, banyan, &c., on which they feed.\r\n\r\nGallus Lafayetti.--The Ceylon jungle fowl. The female of this handsome\r\nbird was figured by Mr. GRAY (_Ill. Ind. Zool._) under the name of G.\r\nStanleyi. The cock bird had long been lost to naturalists, until a\r\nspecimen was forwarded by Dr. Templeton to Mr. Blyth, who at once\r\nrecognised it as the long-looked-for male of Mr. Gray's recently\r\ndescribed female. It is abundant in all the uncultivated portions of\r\nCeylon; coming out into the open spaces to feed in the mornings and\r\nevenings. Mr. Blyth states that there can be no doubt that Hardwicke's\r\npublished figure refers to the hen of this species, long afterwards\r\ntermed G. Lafayetti.\r\n\r\nGalloperdix bicalcaratus. Not uncommon in suitable situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nREPTILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIZARDS. _Iguana_.--One of the earliest, if not the first remarkable\r\nanimal to startle a stranger on arriving in Ceylon, whilst wending his\r\nway from Point-de-Galle to Colombo, is a huge lizard of from four to\r\nfive feet in length, the _Talla-goy[=a]_ of the Singhalese, and\r\nIguana[1] of the Europeans. It may be seen at noonday searching for ants\r\nand insects in the middle of the highway and along the fences; when\r\ndisturbed, but by no means alarmed, by the approach of man, it moves off\r\nto a safe distance; and, the intrusion being at an end, it returns again\r\nto the occupation in which it had been interrupted. Repulsive as it is\r\nin appearance, it is perfectly harmless, and is hunted down by dogs in\r\nthe maritime provinces, and its delicate flesh, which is believed to be\r\na specific in dysentery, is converted into curry, and its skin into\r\nshoes. When seized, it has the power of inflicting a smart blow with its\r\ntail. The Talla-goy[=a] lives in almost any convenient hollow, such as a\r\nhole in the ground, or a deserted nest of the termites; and some small\r\nones, which frequented my garden at Colombo, made their retreat in the\r\nheart of a decayed tree.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Monitor dracæna, _Linn._ Among the barbarous nostrums of\r\nthe uneducated natives, both Singhalese and Tamil, is the tongue of the\r\niguana, which they regard as a specific for consumption, if plucked from\r\nthe living animal and swallowed whole.]\r\n\r\nA still larger species, the _Kabara-goy[=a]_[1], is partial to marshy\r\nground, and when disturbed upon land, will take refuge in the nearest\r\nwater. From the somewhat eruptive appearance of the yellow blotches on\r\nits scales, a closely allied species, similarly spotted, formerly\r\nobtained amongst naturalists the name of _Monitor exanthematicus_, and\r\nit is curious that the native appellation of this one, _kabara_[2], is\r\nsuggestive of the same idea. The Singhalese, on a strictly homoeopathic\r\nprinciple, believe that its fat, externally applied, is a cure for\r\ncutaneous disorders, but that taken inwardly it is poisonous. The\r\nskilfulness of the Singhalese in their preparation of poisons, and their\r\naddiction to using them, are unfortunately notorious traits in the\r\ncharacter of the rural population. Amongst these preparations, the one\r\nwhich above all others excites the utmost dread, from the number of\r\nmurders attributed to its agency, is the potent kabara-tel--a term which\r\nEuropeans sometimes corrupt into _cobra-tel_, implying that the venom is\r\nobtained from the hooded-snake; whereas it professes to be extracted\r\nfrom the \"kabara-goy[=a].\" Such is the bad renown of this formidable\r\npoison, that an individual suspected of having it in his possession, is\r\ncautiously shunned by his neighbours. Those especially who are on\r\ndoubtful terms with him, suspect their servants lest they should be\r\nsuborned to mix kabara-tel in the curry. So subtle is the virus supposed\r\nto be, that one method of administering it, is to introduce it within\r\nthe midrib of a leaf of betel, and close the orifice with chunam; and,\r\nas it is an habitual act of courtesy for one Singhalese on meeting\r\nanother to offer the compliment of a betel-leaf, which it would be\r\nrudeness to refuse, facilities are thus afforded for presenting the\r\nconcealed drug. It is curious that to this latent suspicion has been\r\ntraced the origin of a custom universal amongst the natives, of nipping\r\noff with the thumb nail the thick end of the stem before chewing the\r\nbetel.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Hydrosaurus salvator, _Laur_. Tail compressed; fingers\r\nlong; nostrils near the extremity of the snout. A black band on each\r\ntemple; round yellow spots disposed in transverse series on the back.\r\nTeeth with the crown compressed and notched.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In the _Mahawanso_ the hero Tissa, is said to have been\r\n\"afflicted with a cutaneous complaint which made his skin scaly like\r\nthat of the _godho_.\"--Ch. xxiv. p. 148. \"Godho\" is the Pali name for\r\nthe Kabara-goy[=a].]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE KABARA-GOYA.]\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this mysterious compound, the unfortunate\r\nKabara-goya is forced to take a painfully prominent part. The receipt,\r\nas written down by a Kandyan, was sent to me from Kornegalle, by Mr.\r\nMorris, the civil officer of that district; and in dramatic arrangement\r\nit far outdoes the cauldron of _Macbeth's_ witches. The ingredients are\r\nextracted from venomous snakes, the cobra de capello, the Carawilla, and\r\nthe Tic-polonga, by making incisions in the head of these reptiles and\r\nsuspending them over a chattie to collect the poison as it flows. To\r\nthis, arsenic and other drugs are added, and the whole is \"boiled in a\r\nhuman skull, with the aid of the three Kabara-goyas, which are tied on\r\nthree sides of the fire, with their heads directed towards it, and\r\ntormented by whips to make them hiss, so that the fire may blaze. The\r\nfroth from their lips is then added to the boiling mixture, and so soon\r\nas an oily scum rises to the surface, the _kabara-tel_ is complete.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that arsenic is the main ingredient in the poison, and Mr.\r\nMorris reported to me that the mode of preparing it, described above,\r\nwas actually practised in his district. This account was transmitted by\r\nhim apropos to the murder of a Mohatal[1] and his wife, which had been\r\ncommitted with the _kabara-tel_, and was then under investigation.\r\nBefore commencing the operation of preparing the poison, a cock has to\r\nbe sacrificed to the _yakhos_ or demons.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A native head-man of low rank.]\r\n\r\nThis ugly lizard is itself regarded with such aversion by the\r\nSinghalese, that if a _kabara_ enter a house or walk over the roof, it\r\nis regarded as an omen of ill fortune, sickness, or death; and in order\r\nto avert the evil, a priest is employed to go through a rhythmical\r\nincantation; one portion of which consists in the repetition of the\r\nwords\r\n\r\n  Kabara goyin wan d[=o]sey\r\n  Ada palayan e d[=o]sey.\r\n\r\n\"These are the inflictions caused by the Kabara-goya--let them now be\r\naverted!\"\r\n\r\nIt is one of the incidents that serve to indicate that Ceylon may belong\r\nto a separate circle of physical geography, that this lizard, though\r\nfound to the eastward in Burmah[1], has not hitherto been discovered in\r\nthe Dekkan or Hindustan.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In corroboration of the view propounded elsewhere (see pp.\r\n7, 84, &c), and opposed to the popular belief that Ceylon, at some\r\nremote period, was detached from the continent of India by the\r\ninterposition of the sea, a list of reptiles will be found at p. 319,\r\nincluding not only individual species, but whole genera peculiar to the\r\nisland, and not to be found on the mainland. See a paper by Dr. A.\r\nGÜNTHER on _The Geog. Distribution of Reptiles_. Magaz. Nat. Hist. for\r\nMarch, 1859, p. 230.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALOTES OPHIOMACHUS]\r\n\r\n_Blood-suckers_.--The lizards already mentioned, however, are but the\r\nstranger's introduction to innumerable varieties of others, all most\r\nattractive in their sudden movements, and some unsurpassed in the\r\nbrilliancy of their colouring, which bask on banks, dart over rocks, and\r\npeer curiously out of the chinks of every ruined wall. In all their\r\nmotions there is that vivid and brief energy, the rapid but restrained\r\naction associated with their limited power of respiration, which\r\njustifies the accurate picture of--\r\n\r\n  \"The green lizard, rustling thro' the grass,\r\n  And up the fluted shaft, _with short, quick, spring_\r\n  To vanish in the chinks which time has made.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ROGERS' _Pæstum._]\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful of the race is the _green calotes_[1], in length\r\nabout twelve inches, which, with the exception of a few dark streaks\r\nabout the head, is as brilliant as the purest emerald or malachite.\r\nUnlike its congeners of the same family, it never alters this dazzling\r\nhue; whilst many of them possess, but in a less degree, the power, like\r\nthe chameleon, of exchanging their ordinary colours for others less\r\nconspicuous. One of the most remarkable features in the physiognomy of\r\nthose lizards is the prominence of their cheeks. This results from the\r\ngreat development of the muscles of the jaws; the strength of which is\r\nsuch that they can crush the hardest integuments of the beetles on which\r\nthey feed. The calotes will permit its teeth to be broken, rather than\r\nquit its hold of a stick into which it may have struck them. It is not\r\nprovided, like so many other tropical lizards, with a gular sac or\r\nthroat-pouch, capable of inflation when in a state of high excitement.\r\nThe tail, too, is rounded, not compressed, thus clearly indicating that\r\nits habits are those of a land-animal.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Calotes sp.]\r\n\r\nThe _Calotes versicolor_; and another, the _Calotes ophioimachus_, of\r\nwhich a figure is attached, possess in a remarkable degree the faculty,\r\nabove alluded to, of changing their hue. The head and neck, when the\r\nanimal is irritated or hastily swallowing its food, become of a\r\nbrilliant red (whence the latter species has acquired the name of the\r\n\"blood-sucker\"), whilst the usual tint of the rest of the body is\r\nconverted into pale yellow.[1] The _sitana_[2], and a number of others,\r\nexhibit similar phenomena.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The characteristics by which the _Calotes ophiomachus_ may\r\nbe readily recognised, are a small crest formed by long spines running\r\non each side of the neck to above the ear, coupled with a green\r\nground-colour of the scales. Many specimens are uniform, others banded\r\ntransversely with white, and others again have a black band on each side\r\nof the neck.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Sitana Ponticereana, _Cuv_.]\r\n\r\nThe lyre-headed lizard[1], which is not uncommon in the woods about\r\nKandy, is more bulky than any of the species of Calotes, and not nearly\r\nso active in its movements.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Lyriocephalus scutatus, _Linn._]\r\n\r\nAs usually observed it is of a dull greenish brown, but when excited its\r\nback becomes a rich olive green, leaving the head yellowish: the\r\nunderside of the body is of a very pale blue, almost approaching white.\r\nThe open mouth exhibits the fauces of an intense vermilion tint; so\r\nthat, although extremely handsome, this lizard presents, from its\r\nextraordinarily shaped head and threatening gestures, a most malignant\r\naspect. It is, however, perfectly harmless.\r\n\r\n_Chameleon_.--The true chameleon[1] is found, but not in great numbers,\r\nin the dry districts to the north of Ceylon, where it frequents the\r\ntrees, in slow pursuit of its insect prey; but compensated for the\r\nsluggishness of its other movements, by the electric rapidity of its\r\nextensible tongue. Apparently sluggish in its general habits, the\r\nchameleon rests motionless on a branch, from which its varied hues\r\nrender it scarcely distinguishable in colour; and there patiently awaits\r\nthe approach of the insects on which it feeds. Instantly on their\r\nappearance its wonderful tongue comes into play.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Chameleo vulgaris, _Daud_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TONGUE OF CHAMELEON.]\r\n\r\nThough ordinarily concealed, it is capable of protrusion till it exceeds\r\nin length the whole body of the creature. No sooner does an incautious\r\nfly venture within reach than the extremity of this treacherous weapon\r\nis disclosed, broad and cuneiform, and covered with a viscid fluid; and\r\nthis, extended to its full length, is darted at its prey with an\r\nunerring aim, and redrawn within the jaws with a rapidity that renders\r\nthe act almost invisible.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Prof. RYMER JONES, art. _Reptilia_, in TODD'S _Cyclop. of\r\nAnat_. vol. iv. pt. i. p. 292.]\r\n\r\nWhilst the faculty of this creature to assume all the colours of the\r\nrainbow has attracted the wonder of all ages, sufficient attention has\r\nhardly been given to the imperfect sympathy which subsists between the\r\ntwo lobes of its brain, and the two sets of nerves that permeate the\r\nopposite sides of its frame. Hence, not only has each of the eyes an\r\naction quite independent of the other, but one side of its body appears\r\nto be sometimes asleep whilst the other is vigilant and active; one will\r\nassume a green tinge whilst the opposite one is red; and it is said that\r\nthe chameleon is utterly unable to swim, from the incapacity of the\r\nmuscles of the two sides to act in concert.\r\n\r\n_Ceratophora_.--This which till lately was an unique lizard, known by\r\nonly two specimens, one in the British Museum, and another in that of\r\nLeyden, was ascertained by Dr. Kelaart, about five years ago, to be a\r\nnative of the higher Kandyan hills, where it is sometimes seen in the\r\nolder trees in pursuit of insect larvæ. The first specimen brought to\r\nEurope was called _Ceratophora Stoddartii_, after the name of its\r\nfinder; and the recent discovery of several others in the National\r\nCollection has enabled me, by the aid of Dr. A. Günther, to add some\r\nimportant facts to their history.\r\n\r\nThis lizard is remarkable for having no external ear; and it has\r\nacquired its generic name from the curious horn-like process on the\r\nextremity of the nose. This horn, as it is found in mature males of ten\r\ninches in length, is five lines long, conical, pointed, and slightly\r\ncurved; a miniature form of the formidable weapon, from which the\r\n_Rhinoceros_ takes its name. But the comparison does not hold good\r\neither from an anatomical or a physiological point of view. For, whilst\r\nthe horn of the rhinoceros is merely a dermal production, a\r\nconglomeration of hairs cemented into one dense mass as hard as bone,\r\nand answering the purpose of a defensive weapon, besides being used for\r\ndigging up the roots on which the animal lives; the horn of the\r\n_ceratophora_ is formed of a soft, spongy substance, coated by the\r\nrostral shield, which is produced into a kind of sheath. Although\r\nflexible, it always remains erect, owing to the elasticity of its\r\nsubstance. Not having access to a living specimen, which would afford\r\nthe opportunity of testing conjecture, we are left to infer from the\r\ninternal structure of this horn, that it is an erectile organ which, in\r\nmoments of irritation, will swell like the comb of a cock. This opinion\r\nas to its physiological nature is confirmed by the remarkable\r\ncircumstance that, like the rudimentary comb of the hen and young cocks,\r\nthe female and the immature males of the _ceratophora_ have the horn\r\nexceedingly small. In mature females of eight inches in length (and the\r\nfemales appear always to be smaller than the males), the horn is only\r\none half or one line long; while in immature males five inches in\r\nlength, it is one line and a half.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CERATOPHORA TENNENTII and C. STODDARTII]\r\n\r\nAmong the specimens sent from Ceylon by Dr. Kelaart, and now in the\r\nBritish Museum, there is one which so remarkably differs from _C.\r\nStoddartii_, that it attracted my attention, by the peculiar form of\r\nthis rostral appendage. Dr. Günther pronounced it to be a new species;\r\nand Dr. Gray concurring in this opinion, they have done me the honour to\r\ncall it _Ceratophora Tennentii_. Its \"horn\" somewhat resembles the comb\r\nof a cock not only in its internal structure, but also in its external\r\nappearance; it is nearly six lines long by two broad, slightly\r\ncompressed, soft, flexile, and extensible, and covered with a\r\ncorrugated, granular skin. It bears no resemblance to the depressed\r\nrostral hump of _Lyriocephalus_, and the differences of the new species\r\nfrom the latter lizard may be easily seen from the annexed drawing and\r\nthe notes given below.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The specimen in the British Museum is apparently an adult\r\nmale, ten inches long, and is, with regard to the distribution of the\r\nscales and the form of the head very similar to _C. Stoddartii_. The\r\nposterior angles of the orbit are not projecting, but there is a small\r\ntubercle behind them; and a pair of somewhat larger tubercles on the\r\nneck. The gular sac is absent. There are five longitudinal quadrangular,\r\nimbricate scales on each side of the throat; and the sides of the body\r\npresent a nearly horizontal series of similar scales. The scales on the\r\nmedian line of the back scarcely form a crest; it is, however distinct\r\non the nape of the neck. The scales on the belly, on the extremities,\r\nand on the tail are slightly keeled. Tail nearly round. This species is\r\nmore uniformly coloured than _C. Stoddartii_; it is greenish, darker on\r\nthe sides.]\r\n\r\n_Geckoes_.--The most familiar and attractive of the lizard class are the\r\n_Geckoes_[1], that frequent the sitting-rooms, and being furnished with\r\npads to each toe, they are enabled to ascend perpendicular walls and\r\nadhere to glass and ceilings. Being nocturnal in their habits, the pupil\r\nof the eye, instead of being circular as in the diurnal species, is\r\nlinear and vertical like that of the cat. As soon as evening arrives,\r\nthe geckoes are to be seen in every house in keen and crafty pursuit of\r\ntheir prey; emerging from the chinks and recesses where they conceal\r\nthemselves during the day, to search for insects that then retire to\r\nsettle for the night. In a boudoir where the ladies of my family spent\r\ntheir evenings, one of these familiar and amusing little creatures had\r\nits hiding-place behind a gilt picture frame. Punctually as the candles\r\nwere lighted, it made its appearance on the wall to be fed with its\r\naccustomed crumbs; and if neglected, it reiterated it sharp, quick call\r\nof _chic, chic, chit,_ till attended to. It was of a delicate gray\r\ncolour, tinged with pink; and having by accident fallen on a work-table,\r\nit fled, leaving part of its tail behind it, which, however, it\r\nreproduced within less than a month. This faculty of reproduction is\r\ndoubtless designed to enable the creature to escape from its assailants:\r\nthe detaching of the limb is evidently its own act; and it is\r\nobservable, that when reproduced, the tail generally exhibits some\r\nvariation from the previous form, the diverging spines being absent, the\r\nnew portion covered with small square uniform scales placed in a cross\r\nseries, and the scuta below being seldom so distinct as in the original\r\nmember.[2] In an officer's quarters in the fort of Colombo, a geckoe had\r\nbeen taught to come daily to the dinner-table, and always made its\r\nappearance along with the dessert. The family were absent for some\r\nmonths, during which the house underwent extensive repairs, the roof\r\nhaving been raised, the walls stuccoed, and the ceilings whitened. It\r\nwas naturally surmised that so long a suspension of its accustomed\r\nhabits would have led to the disappearance of the little lizard; but on\r\nthe return of its old friends, it made its entrance as usual at their\r\nfirst dinner the instant the cloth was removed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Hemidactylus maculatus, _Dum_. et _Bib_., H. Leschenaultii,\r\n_Dum_, et _Bib_; H. frenatus, _Schlegel_. Of these the last is very\r\ncommon in the houses of Colombo. Colour, grey; sides with small\r\ngranules; thumb short; chin-shields four; tail rounded with transverse\r\nseries of small spines; femoral and preanal pores in a continuous line.\r\nGRAY, _Lizard_, p. 155.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Brit. Mus. Cat._ p. 143; KELAART's _Prod. Faun. Zeylan.,_\r\np. 183.]\r\n\r\n_Crocodile._--The Portuguese in India, like the Spaniards in South\r\nAmerica, affixed the name of _lagarto_ to the huge reptiles that\r\ninfested the rivers and estuaries of both continents; and to the present\r\nday the Europeans in Ceylon apply the term _alligator_ to what are in\r\nreality _crocodiles_, which literally swarm in the still waters and\r\ntanks in the low country, but rarely frequent rapid streams, and have\r\nnever been found in the marshes among the hills. The differences,\r\nhowever, between the two, when once ascertained, are sufficiently\r\nmarked, to prevent their being afterwards confounded. The head of the\r\nalligator is broader and the snout less prolonged, and the canine teeth\r\nof the under jaw, instead of being received into foramina in the upper,\r\nas in the crocodile, fit into furrows on each side of it. The legs of\r\nthe alligator, too, are not denticulated, and the feet are only\r\nsemi-palmate.\r\n\r\nThe following drawing exhibits a cranium of each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKULLS OF ALLIGATOR AND CROCODILE]\r\n\r\nThe instincts of the crocodiles in Ceylon do not lead to any variation\r\nfrom the habits of those found in other countries. There would appear to\r\nbe two well-distinguished species found in the island, the\r\n_Eli-kimboola_[1], the Indian crocodile, inhabiting the rivers and\r\nestuaries throughout the low countries of the coasts, attaining the\r\nlength of sixteen or eighteen feet, and ready to assail man when pressed\r\nby hunger; and the marsh-crocodile[2], which lives exclusively in fresh\r\nwater, frequenting the tanks in the northern and central provinces, and\r\nconfining its attacks to the smaller animals: in length it seldom\r\nexceeds twelve or thirteen feet. Sportsmen complain that their dogs are\r\nconstantly seized by both species; and water-fowl, when shot, frequently\r\ndisappear before they can be secured by the fowler.[3] It is generally\r\nbelieved in Ceylon that, in the case of larger animals, the crocodile\r\nabstains from devouring them till the commencement of decomposition\r\nfacilitates the operation of swallowing. To assist in this, the natives\r\nassure me that the reptile contrives to fasten the carcase behind the\r\nroots of a mangrove or some other convenient tree and tears off each\r\npiece by a backward spring.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Crocodilus biporcatus. _Cuvier_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Crododilus palustris, _Less_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: In Siam the flesh of the crocodile is sold for food in the\r\nmarkets and bazaars, \"Un jour je vis plus de cinquante crocodiles,\r\npetits et grands, attachés aux colonnes de leurs maisons. Ils es vendent\r\nla chair comme on vendrait de la chair de porc, mais à bien meilleur\r\nmarché.\"-PALLEGOIX, _Siam_, vol. i. p. 174.]\r\n\r\nThere is another popular belief that the crocodile is exceedingly\r\nsensitive to tickling; and that it will relax its hold of a man, if he\r\ncan only contrive to reach and rub with his hand the softer parts of its\r\nunder side.[1] An incident indicative of some reality in this piece of\r\nfolklore, once came under my own observation. One morning, about\r\nsunrise, when riding across the sandy plain near the old fort of\r\nMoeletivoe, we came suddenly upon a crocodile asleep under some bushes\r\nof the Buffalo-thorn, several hundred yards from the water. The terror\r\nof the poor wretch was extreme, when it awoke and found itself\r\ndiscovered and completely surrounded. It was a hideous creature, upwards\r\nof ten feet long, and evidently of prodigious strength, had it been in a\r\ncondition to exert it, but consternation completely paralysed it. It\r\nstarted to its feet and turned round in a circle hissing and clanking\r\nits bony jaws, with its ugly green eye intently fixed upon us. On being\r\nstruck with a stick, it lay perfectly quiet and apparently dead.\r\nPresently it looked cunningly round, and made a rush towards the water,\r\nbut on a second blow it lay again motionless and feigning death. We\r\ntried to rouse it, but without effect, pulled its tail, slapped its\r\nback, struck its hard scales, and teased it in every way, but all in\r\nvain; nothing would induce it to move till accidentally my son, then a\r\nboy of twelve years old, tickled it gently under the arm, and in an\r\ninstant it drew the limb close to its side and turned to avoid a\r\nrepetition of the experiment. Again it was touched under the other arm,\r\nand the same emotion was exhibited, the great monster twisting about\r\nlike an infant to avoid being tickled. The scene was highly amusing, but\r\nthe sun was rising high, and we pursued our journey to Moeletivoe,\r\nleaving the crocodile to make its way to the adjoining lake.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A native gentleman who resided for a long time at Caltura\r\ntells me that in the rivers which flow into the sea, both there and at\r\nBentotte, crocodiles are frequently caught in corrals, formed of stakes\r\ndriven into the ground in shallow water, and so constructed, that when\r\nthe reptile enters to seize the bait placed within, the aperture closes\r\nbehind and secures him. A professional \"crocodile charmer\" then enters\r\nmuttering a spell, and with one end of a stick pats the creature gently\r\non the head for a time. The operator then boldly mounts astride upon its\r\nshoulders, and continues to soothe it with his one hand, whilst with the\r\nother he contrives to pass a rope under its body, by which it is at last\r\ndragged on shore. This story serves to corroborate the narrative of Mr.\r\nWaterton and his alligator.]\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese believe that the crocodile can only move swiftly on sand\r\nor smooth clay, its feet being too tender to tread firmly on hard or\r\nstony ground. In the dry season, when the watercourses begin to fail and\r\nthe tanks become exhausted, the marsh-crocodiles have occasionally been\r\nencountered in the jungle, wandering in search of water. During a severe\r\ndrought in 1844, they deserted a tank near Kornegalle and traversed the\r\ntown during the night, on their way to another reservoir in the suburb;\r\ntwo or three fell into the wells; others in their trepidation, laid eggs\r\nin the street, and some were found entangled in garden fences and\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nGenerally, however, during the extreme drought, when unable to procure\r\ntheir ordinary food from the drying up of the watercourses, they bury\r\nthemselves in the mud, and remain in a state of torpor till released by\r\nthe recurrence of rains.[1] At Arne-tivoe, in the eastern province,\r\nwhilst riding across the parched bed of the tank, I was shown the\r\nrecess, still bearing the form and impress of a crocodile, out of which\r\nthe animal had been seen to emerge the day before. A story was also\r\nrelated to me of an officer attached to the department of the\r\nSurveyor-General, who, having pitched his tent in a similar position,\r\nwas disturbed during the night by feeling a movement of the earth below\r\nhis bed, from which on the following day a crocodile emerged, making its\r\nappearance from beneath the matting.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HERODOTUS records the observations of the Egyptians that\r\nthe crocodile of the Nile abstains from food during the four winter\r\nmonths.--_Euterpe_, lviii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: HUMBOLDT relates a similar story as occurring at Calabazo,\r\nin Venezuela.--_Personal Narrative_, c, xvi.]\r\n\r\nThe fresh water species that inhabits the tanks is essentially cowardly\r\nin it instincts, and hastens to conceal itself on the appearance of man.\r\nA gentleman (who told me the circumstance), when riding in the jungle,\r\novertook a crocodile, evidently roaming in search of water. It fled to a\r\nshallow pool almost dried by the sun, and, thrusting its head into the\r\nmud till it covered up its eyes, remained unmoved in profound confidence\r\nof perfect concealment. In 1833, during the progress of the Pearl\r\nFishery, Sir Robert Wilmot Horton employed men to drag for crocodiles in\r\na pond which was infested by them in the immediate vicinity of Aripo.\r\nThe pool was about fifty yards in length, by ten or twelve wide,\r\nshallowing gradually to the edge, and not exceeding four or five feet at\r\nthe deepest part. As the party approached the bund, from twenty to\r\nthirty reptiles, which had been basking in the sun, rose and fled to the\r\nwater. A net, specially weighted so as to sink its lower edge to the\r\nbottom, was then stretched from bank to bank and swept to the further\r\nend of the pond, followed by a line of men with poles to drive the\r\ncrocodiles forward: so complete was the arrangement, that no individual\r\ncould have evaded the net, yet, to the astonishment of the Governor's\r\nparty, not one was to be found when it was drawn on shore, and no means\r\nof escape for them was apparent or possible except by their descending\r\ninto the mud at the bottom of the pond.\r\n\r\nThe lagoon of Batticaloa, and indeed all the still waters of this\r\ndistrict, are remarkable for the numbers and prodigious size of the\r\ncrocodiles which infest them. Their teeth are sometimes so large that\r\nthe natives mount them with silver lids and use them for boxes to carry\r\nthe powdered chunam, which they chew with the betel leaf. During one of\r\nmy visits to the lake a crocodile was caught within a few yards of the\r\ngovernment agent's residence, a hook having been laid the night before,\r\nbaited with the entrails of a goat; and made fast, in the native\r\nfashion, by a bunch of fine cords, which the creature cannot gnaw\r\nasunder as it would a solid rope, since they sink into the spaces\r\nbetween its teeth. The one taken was small, being only about ten or\r\neleven feet in length, whereas they are frequently killed from fifteen\r\nto nineteen feet long. As long as it was in the water, it made strong\r\nresistance to being hauled on shore, carrying the canoe out into the\r\ndeep channel, and occasionally raising its head above the surface, and\r\nclashing its jaws together menacingly. This action has a horrid sound,\r\nas the crocodile has no fleshy lips; and it brings its teeth and the\r\nbones of the mouth together with a loud crash, like the clank of two\r\npieces of hard wood. After playing it a little, the boatmen drew it to\r\nland, and when once fairly on the shore all courage and energy seemed\r\nutterly to desert it. It tried once or twice to regain the water, but at\r\nlast lay motionless and perfectly helpless on the sand. It was no easy\r\nmatter to kill it; a rifle ball sent diagonally through its breast had\r\nlittle or no effect, and even when the shot had been repeated more than\r\nonce, it was as full of life as ever.[1] It feigned death and lay\r\nmotionless, with its eye closed; but, on being pricked with a spear, it\r\nsuddenly regained all its activity. It was at last finished by a\r\nharpoon, and then opened. Its maw contained several small tortoises, and\r\na quantity of broken bricks and gravel, taken medicinally, to promote\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A remarkable instance of the vitality of the common\r\ncrocodile, _C. biporcatus_, was related to me by a gentleman at Galle:\r\nhe had caught on a baited hook an unusually large one, which his coolies\r\ndisembowelled, the aperture in the stomach being left expanded by a\r\nstick placed across it. On returning in the afternoon with a view to\r\nsecure the head, they found that the creature had crawled for some\r\ndistance, and made its escape into the water.\r\n\r\n\"A curious incident occurred some years ago on the Maguruganga, a stream\r\nwhich flows through the Pasdun Corle, to join the Bentolle river. A man\r\nwas fishing seated on the branch of a tree that overhung the water; and\r\nto shelter himself from the drizzling rain, he covered his head and\r\nshoulder with a bag folded into a shape common with the natives. While\r\nin this attitude, a leopard sprang upon him from the jungle, but missing\r\nits aim, seized the bag and not the man, and fell with it into the\r\nriver. Here a crocodile, which had been eyeing the angler is despair,\r\nseized the leopard as it fell, and sunk with it to the\r\nbottom.\"--_Letter_ from GOONE-RATNE Modliar, interpreter of the Supreme\r\nCourt, 10th Jany., 1861.]\r\n\r\nDuring our journeys we had numerous opportunities of observing the\r\nhabits of these hideous creatures, and I am far from considering them so\r\nformidable as they are usually supposed to be. They are evidently not\r\nwantonly destructive; they act only under the influence of hunger, and\r\neven then their motions on land are awkward and ungainly, their action\r\ntimid, and their whole demeanour devoid of the sagacity and courage\r\nwhich characterise other animals of prey.\r\n\r\nTESTUDINATA. _Tortoise_.--Land tortoises are numerous, but present no\r\nremarkable features beyond the beautiful marking of the starred\r\nvariety[1], which is common in the north-western province around Putlam\r\nand Chilaw, and is distinguished by the bright yellow rays which\r\ndiversify the deep black of its dorsal shield. From one of these which\r\nwas kept in my garden I took a number of flat ticks (_Ixodes_), which\r\nadhere to its fleshy neck in such a position as to baffle any attempt of\r\nthe animal itself to remove them; but as they are exposed to constant\r\ndanger of being crushed against the plastron during the protrusion and\r\nretraction of the head, each is covered with a horny case almost as\r\nresistant as the carapace of the tortoise itself. Such an adaptation of\r\nstructure is scarcely less striking than that of the parasites found on\r\nthe spotted lizard of Berar by Dr. Hooker, each of which presents the\r\ndistinct colour of the scale to which it adheres.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Testudo stellata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE THREE-RIDGED TORTOISE (EMYS TRIJUGA)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: HOOKER'S _Himalayan Journals_, vol. i. p. 37.]\r\n\r\nThe marshes and pools of the interior are frequented by _terrapins_[1],\r\nwhich the natives are in the habit of keeping alive in wells under the\r\nconviction that they clear them of impurities. These fresh-water\r\ntortoises, the greater number of which are included in the genus _Emys_\r\nof naturalists, are distinguished by having their toes webbed. Their\r\nshell is less convex than that of their congeners on land (but more\r\nelevated than that of the sea-turtle); and it has been observed that the\r\nmore rounded the shell, the nearer does the terrapin approach to the\r\nland-tortoise both in its habits and in the choice of its food. Some of\r\nthem live upon animal as well as vegetable food, and those which subsist\r\nexclusively on the former, are noted as having the flattest shells.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Cryptopus granum_, SCHÖPF; DR. KELAART, in his _Prodromus_\r\n(p. 179), refers this to the common Indian species, _C. punctata_; but\r\nit is distinct. It is generally distributed in the lower parts of\r\nCeylon, in lakes and tanks. It is the one usually put into wells to act\r\nthe part of a scavenger. By the Singhalese it is named _Kiri-ibba_.]\r\n\r\nThe terrapins lay about thirty eggs in the course of several weeks, and\r\nthese are round, with a calcareous shell. They thrive in captivity,\r\nprovided that they have a regular supply of water and of meat, cut into\r\nsmall pieces and thrown to them. The tropical species, if transferred to\r\na colder climate, should have arrangements made for enabling them to\r\nhybernate during the winter: they will die in a very short time if\r\nexposed to a temperature below the freezing point.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Of the _Emys trijuga_, the fresh water tortoise figured on\r\npreceding page, the technical characteristics are;--vertical plates\r\nlozenge-shaped; shell convex and oval; with three more or less distinct\r\nlongitudinal keels; shields corrugated; with areola situated in the\r\nupper posterior corner. Shell brown, with the areolæ and the keels\r\nyellowish; head brown, with a yellow streak over each eye.]\r\n\r\nThe edible turtle[1] is found on all the coasts of the island, and sells\r\nfor a few shillings or a few pence, according to its size and abundance\r\nat the moment. A very repulsive spectacle is exhibited in the markets of\r\nJaffna by the mode in which the flesh of the turtle is sold piece-meal,\r\nwhilst the animal is still alive, by the families of the Tamil\r\nfishermen. The creatures are to be seen in the market-place undergoing\r\nthis frightful mutilation; the plastron and its integuments having been\r\npreviously removed, and the animal thrown on its back, so as to display\r\nall the motions of the heart, viscera, and lungs. A broad knife, from\r\ntwelve to eighteen inches in length, is first inserted at the left side,\r\nand the women, who are generally the operators, introduce one hand to\r\nscoop out the blood, which oozes slowly. The blade is next passed round,\r\ntill the lower shell is detached and placed on one side, and the\r\ninternal organs exposed in full action. A customer, as he applies, is\r\nserved with any part selected, which is cut off as ordered, and sold by\r\nweight. Each of the fins is thus successively removed, with portions of\r\nthe fat and flesh, the turtle showing, by its contortions, that each act\r\nof severance is productive of agony. In this state it lies for hours,\r\nwrithing in the sun, the heart[2] and head being usually the last pieces\r\nselected, and till the latter is cut off the snapping of the mouth, and\r\nthe opening and closing of the eyes, show that life is still inherent,\r\neven when the shell has been nearly divested of its contents.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Chelonia virgata, _Schweig_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: ARISTOTLE was aware of the fact that the turtle will live\r\nafter the removal of the heart.--_De Vita et Morte_, ch. ii.]\r\n\r\nAt certain seasons the flesh of turtle on the south-western coast of\r\nCeylon is avoided as poisonous, and some lamentable instances are\r\nrecorded of deaths ascribed to its use. At Pantura, to the south of\r\nColombo, twenty-eight persons who had partaken of turtle in October,\r\n1840, were immediately seized with sickness, after which coma\r\nsupervened, and eighteen died during the night. Those who survived said\r\nthere was nothing unusual in the appearance of the flesh except that it\r\nwas fatter than ordinary. Other similarly fatal occurrences have been\r\nattributed to turtle curry; but as they have never been proved to\r\nproceed exclusively from that source, there is room for believing that\r\nthe poison may have been contained in some other ingredient.\r\n\r\nIn the Gulf of Manaar turtle is frequently found of such a size as to\r\nmeasure between four and five feet in length; and on one occasion, in\r\nriding along the sea-shore north of Putlam, I saw a man in charge of\r\nsome sheep, resting under the shade of a turtle shell, which he had\r\nerected on sticks to protect him from the sun--almost verifying the\r\nstatement of Ælian, that in the seas off Ceylon there are tortoises so\r\nlarge that several persons may find ample shelter beneath a single\r\nshell.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: [Greek: \"Tiktontai de ara en tautê tê thalattê, kai\r\nchelônai megistai, ônper oun ta elytra orophoi ginontai kai gar esti kai\r\npentekaideka pêchôn en chelôneion, ôs hypoikein ouk oligous, kai tous\r\nhêlious pyrodestatous apostegei, kai skian asmenois parechei.\"]--Lib.\r\nxvi. c. 17.

May not Megasthenes have referred to some\r\ntradition connected with the gigantic fossilised species discovered on\r\nthe Sewalik Hills, the remains of which are now in the Museum at the\r\nEast India House?]\r\n\r\nThe hawksbill-turtle[1], which supplies the tortoise-shell of commerce,\r\nwas at former times taken in great numbers in the vicinity of\r\nHambangtotte during the season when they came to deposit their eggs.\r\nThis gave rise to the trade in tortoise-shell at Point de Galle, where\r\nit is still manufactured into articles of ornament by the Moors; but the\r\nshell they employ is almost entirely imported from the Maldives.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Caretta imbricata, _Linn._]\r\n\r\nIf taken from the animal after death and decomposition, the colour of\r\nthe shell becomes clouded and milky, and hence the cruel expedient is\r\nresorted to of seizing the turtles as they repair to the shore to\r\ndeposit their eggs, and suspending them over fires till heat makes the\r\nplates on the dorsal shields start from the bone of the carapace, after\r\nwhich the creature is permitted to escape to the water.[1] In\r\nillustration of the resistless influence of instinct at the period of\r\nbreeding, it may be mentioned that the identical tortoise is believed to\r\nreturn again and again to the same spot, notwithstanding that at each\r\nvisit she may have to undergo a repetition of this torture. In the year\r\n1826, a hawksbill turtle was taken near Hambangtotte, which bore a ring\r\nattached to one of its fins that had been placed there by a Dutch\r\nofficer thirty years before, with a view to establish the fact of these\r\nrecurring visits to the same beach.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At Celebes, whence the finest tortoise-shell is exported to\r\nChina, the natives kill the turtle by blows on the head, and immerse the\r\nshell in boiling water to detach the plates. Dry heat is only resorted\r\nto by the unskilful, who frequently destroy the tortoise-shell in the\r\noperation--_Journal Indian Archipel_. vol. iii. p. 227, 1849.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: BENNETT'S _Ceylon, &c._, c. xxxiv.]\r\n\r\nAn opportunity is afforded on the sea-shore of Ceylon for observing a\r\nremarkable illustration of instinct in the turtle, when about to deposit\r\nits eggs. As if conscious that if she went and returned by one and the\r\nsame line across the sandy beach, her hiding place would be discovered\r\nat its farthest extremity, she resorts to the expedient of curving her\r\ncourse, so as to regain the sea by a different track; and after\r\ndepositing the eggs, burying them about eighteen inches deep, she\r\ncarefully smoothes over the surface to render the precise spot\r\nindiscernible. The Singhalese, aware of this device, sound her line of,\r\nmarch with a rod till they come upon the concealed nest.\r\n\r\n_Snakes_.--It is perhaps owing to the aversion excited by the ferocious\r\nexpression and unusual action of serpents, combined with an instinctive\r\ndread of attack[1], that exaggerated ideas prevail both as to their\r\nnumbers in Ceylon, and the danger to be apprehended from encountering\r\nthem. The Singhalese profess to distinguish a great many kinds, of which\r\nthey say not more than one half have as yet been scientifically\r\nidentified[2]; but so cautiously do serpents make their appearance, that\r\nthe surprise of persons long resident is invariably expressed at the\r\nrarity with which they are to be seen; and from my own journeys through\r\nthe jungle, often of from two to five hundred miles, I have frequently\r\nreturned without observing a single snake. Mr. Bennett, who resided much\r\nin the south-east of the island, ascribes the rarity of serpents in the\r\njungle to the abundance of the wild peafowl, whose partiality to young\r\nsnakes renders them the chief destroyers of these reptiles. It is\r\nlikely, too, that they are killed by the jungle-cocks; for they are\r\nfrequently eaten by the common barn-door fowl in Ceylon. This is\r\nrendered the more probable by the fact, that in those districts where\r\nthe extension of cultivation, and the visits of sportsmen, have reduced\r\nthe numbers of the jungle-cocks and pea-fowl, snakes have perceptibly\r\nincreased. The deer also are enemies of the snakes, and the natives who\r\nhave had opportunities of watching their encounters assert that they\r\nhave seen deer rush upon a serpent and crush it by leaping on it with\r\nall its four feet. As to the venomous powers of snakes, DR. DAVY, whose\r\nattention was carefully directed to the poisonous serpents of Ceylon[3],\r\ncame to the conclusion that but _four_, out of twenty species examined\r\nby him, were venomous, and that of these only two (the _tic-polonga_[4]\r\nand _cobra de capello_[5]) were capable of inflicting a wound likely to\r\nbe fatal to man. The third is the _carawala_[6], a brown snake of about\r\ntwo feet in length; and for the fourth, of which only a few specimens\r\nhave been procured, the Singhalese have no name in their vernacular--a\r\nproof that it is neither deadly nor abundant. But Dr. Davy's estimate of\r\nthe venom of the _carawala_ is below the truth, as cases have been\r\nauthenticated to me, in which death from its bite ensued within a few\r\ndays. The effect, however, is not uniformly fatal; a circumstance which\r\nthe natives explain by asserting that there are three varieties of the\r\ncarawala, named the _hil-la_, the _dunu_, and the _mal_-carawala; the\r\nsecond being the largest and the most dreaded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Genesis iii. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This is not likely to be true: in a very large collection\r\nof snakes made in Ceylon by Mr. C.R. Butler, and recently examined by\r\nDr. Günther, of the British Museum, only a single-specimen proved to be\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one venomous snake, of the existence of which I am\r\nassured by a native correspondent in Ceylon, no mention has yet been\r\nmade by European naturalists. It is called M[=a]pil[=a] by the\r\nSinghalese; it is described to me as being about four feet in length, of\r\nthe diameter of the little finger, and of a uniform dark brown colour.\r\nIt is said to be often seen in company with another snake called in\r\nSinghalese _Lay Medilla_, a name which implies its deep red hue. The\r\nlatter is believed to be venomous. It would be well if some collector in\r\nCeylon would send home for examination the species which respectively\r\nbear these names.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See DAVY'S _Ceylon_, ch. xiv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Daboia elegans, _Daud._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Naja tripudians, _Merr._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Trigonocephalus hypnale, _Merr._]\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the _tic-polonga_, particularised by Dr. Davy, is said\r\nto be but one out of seven varieties of that formidable reptile. The\r\nword \"tic\" means literally the \"spotted\" polonga, from the superior\r\nclearness of the markings on its scales. Another, the _nidi_, or\r\n\"sleeping\" polonga, is so called from the fact that a person bitten by\r\nit is soon prostrated by a lethargy from which he never awakes.[1] These\r\nformidable serpents so infested the official residence of the District\r\nJudge of Trincomalie in 1858, as to compel his family to abandon it. In\r\nanother instance, a friend of mine, going hastily to take a supply of\r\nwafers from an open tin case which stood in his office, drew back his\r\nhand, on finding the box occupied by a tic-polonga coiled within it.\r\nDuring my residence in Ceylon, I never heard of the death of a European\r\nwhich was caused by the bite of a snake; and in the returns of coroners'\r\ninquests made officially to my department, such accidents to the natives\r\nappear chiefly to have happened at night, when the animal, having been\r\nsurprised or trodden on, inflicted the wound in self-defence.[2] For\r\nthese reasons the Singhalese, when obliged to leave their houses in the\r\ndark, carry a stick with a loose ring, the noise[3] of which as they\r\nstrike it on the ground is sufficient to warn the snakes to leave their\r\npath.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The other varieties are the _getta, lay, alu, kunu,_ and\r\n_nil-polongas._ I have heard of an eighth, the _palla-polonga_.\r\n\r\nAmongst the numerous pieces of folk-lore in Ceylon in connexion with\r\nsnakes, is the belief that a deadly enmity subsists between the polonga\r\nand the cobra de capello, and that the latter, which is naturally shy\r\nand retiring, is provoked to conflicts by the audacity of its rival.\r\nHence the proverb applied to persons at enmity, that \"they hate like the\r\npolonga and cobra.\"\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese believe the polonga to be by far the most savage and\r\nwanton of the two, and they illustrate this by a popular legend, that\r\nonce upon a time a child, in the absence of its mother, was playing\r\nbeside a tub of water, which a cobra, impelled by thirst during a\r\nlong-continued drought, approached to drink, the unconscious child all\r\nthe while striking it with its hands to prevent the intrusion. The\r\ncobra, on returning, was met by a tic-polonga, which seeing its scales\r\ndripping with delicious moisture, entreated to be told the way to the\r\nwell. The cobra, knowing the vicious habits of the other snake, and\r\nanticipating that it would kill the innocent child which it had so\r\nrecently spared, at first refused, and only yielded on condition that\r\nthe infant was not to be molested. But the polonga, on reaching the tub,\r\nwas no sooner obstructed by the little one, than it stung him to death.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In a return of 112 coroners' inquests, in cases of death\r\nfrom wild animals, held in Ceylon in five years, from 1851 to 1855\r\ninclusive, 68 are ascribed to the bites of serpents; and in almost every\r\ninstance the assault is set down as having taken place _at night_. The\r\nmajority of the sufferers were children and women.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: PLINY notices that the serpent has the sense of hearing\r\nmore acute than that of sight; and that it is more frequently put in\r\nmotion by the sound of footsteps than by the appearance of the intruder,\r\n\"excitatur pede sæpius.\"--Lib, viii. c. 36.]\r\n\r\n_Cobra de Capello._--The cobra de capello is the only one exhibited by\r\nthe itinerant snake-charmers: and the truth of Davy's conjecture, that\r\nthey control it, not by extracting its fangs, but by courageously\r\navailing themselves of its well-known timidity and extreme reluctance to\r\nuse its fatal weapons, received a painful confirmation during my\r\nresidence in Ceylon, by the death of one of these performers, whom his\r\naudience had provoked to attempt some unaccustomed familiarity with the\r\ncobra; it bit him on the wrist, and he expired the same evening. The\r\nhill near Kandy, on which the official residences of the Governor and\r\nColonial Secretary are built, is covered in many places with the\r\ndeserted nests of the white ants (_termites_), and these are the\r\nfavourite retreats of the sluggish and spiritless cobra, which watches\r\nfrom their apertures the toads and lizards on which it preys. Here, when\r\nI have repeatedly come upon them, their only impulse was concealment;\r\nand on one occasion, when a cobra of considerable length could not\r\nescape, owing to the bank being nearly precipitous on both sides of the\r\nroad, a few blows from my whip were sufficient to deprive it of life.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A Singhalese work, the _Sarpados[=a]_, enumerates four\r\ncastes of the cobra;--the _raja_, or king: the _bamunu_, or Brahman; the\r\n_velanda_, or trader; and the _gori_, or agriculturist. Of these the\r\nraja, or \"king of the cobras,\" is said to have the head and the anterior\r\nhalf of the body of so light a colour, that at a distance it seems like\r\na silvery white. The work is quoted, but not correctly, in the _Ceylon\r\nTimes_ for January, 1857. It is more than probable, as the division\r\nrepresents the four castes of the Hindus, Chastriyas, Brahmans Vaisyas,\r\nand Sudras; that the insertion of the _gori_ instead of the latter was a\r\npious fraud of some copyist to confer rank upon the Vellales, the\r\nagricultural caste of Ceylon.]\r\n\r\nA gentleman who held a civil appointment at Kornegalle, had a servant\r\nwho was bitten by a snake and he informed me that on enlarging a hole\r\nnear the foot of the tree under which the accident occurred, he\r\nunearthed a cobra of upwards of three feet long, and so purely white as\r\nto induce him to believe that it was an albino. With the exception of\r\nthe _rat-snake_[1], the cobra de capello is the only serpent which seems\r\nfrom choice to frequent the vicinity of human dwellings, doubtless\r\nattracted by the young of the domestic fowl and by the moisture of the\r\nwells and drainage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Coryphodon Blumenbachii._ There is a belief in Ceylon that\r\nthe bite of the rat-snake, though harmless to man, is fatal to black\r\ncattle. The Singhalese add that it would be equally so to man were the\r\nwound to be touched by cow-dung. WOLF, in the interesting story of his\r\n_Life and Adventures in Ceylon_, mentions that rat-snakes were often so\r\ndomesticated by the native as to feed at their table. He says: \"I once\r\nsaw an example of this in the house of a native. It being meal time, he\r\ncalled his snake, which immediately came forth from the roof under which\r\nhe and I were sitting. He gave it victuals from his own dish, which the\r\nsnake took of itself from off a fig-leaf that was laid for it, and ate\r\nalong with its host. When it had eaten its fill, he gave it a kiss, and\r\nbade it go to its hole.\" Major SKINNER, writing to me 12th Dec., 1858,\r\nmentions the still more remarkable case of the domestication of the\r\ncobra de capello in Ceylon. \"Did you ever hear,\" he says, \"of tame\r\ncobras being kept and domesticated about a house, going in and out at\r\npleasure, and in common with the rest of the inmates? In one family,\r\nnear Negombo, cobras are kept as protectors, in the place of dogs, by a\r\nwealthy man who has always large sums of money in his house. But this is\r\nnot a solitary case of the kind. I heard of it only the other day, but\r\nfrom undoubtedly good authority. The snakes glide about the house, a\r\nterror to thieves, but never attempting to harm the inmates.\"]\r\n\r\nThe young cobras, it is said, in the _Sarpa-dosa_, are not venomous till\r\nafter the thirteenth day, when they shed their coat for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese remark that if one cobra be destroyed near a house, its\r\ncompanion is almost certain to be discovered immediately after,--a\r\npopular belief which I had an opportunity of verifying on more than one\r\noccasion. Once, when a snake of this description was killed in a bath of\r\nthe Government House at Colombo, its mate was found in the same spot the\r\nday after; and again, at my own stables, a cobra of five feet long,\r\nhaving fallen into the well, which was too deep to permit its escape,\r\nits companion of the same size was found the same morning in an\r\nadjoining drain.[1] On this occasion the snake, which had been several\r\nhours in the well, swam with ease, raising its head and hood above\r\nwater; and instances have repeatedly occurred of the cobra de capello\r\nvoluntarily taking considerable excursions by sea. When the\r\n\"Wellington,\" a government vessel employed in the conservancy of the\r\npearl banks, was anchored about a quarter of a mile from the land, in\r\nthe bay of Koodremalé, a cobra was seen, about an hour before sunset,\r\nswimming vigorously towards the ship. It came within twelve yards, when\r\nthe sailors assailed it with billets of wood and other missiles, and\r\nforced it to return to land. The following morning they discovered the\r\ntrack which it had left on the shore, and traced it along the sand till\r\nit was lost in the jungle. On a later occasion, in the vicinity of the\r\nsame spot, when the \"Wellington\" was lying at some distance from the\r\nshore, a cobra was found and killed on board, where it could only have\r\ngained access by climbing up the cable. It was first discovered by a\r\nsailor, who felt the chill as it glided over his foot.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PLINY notices the affection that subsists between the male\r\nand female asp; and that if one of them happens to be killed, the other\r\nseeks to avenge its death.--Lib. viii. c. 37.]\r\n\r\nOne curious tradition in Ceylon embodies the popular legend, that the\r\nstomach of the cobra de capello occasionally contains a precious stone\r\nof such unapproachable brilliancy as to surpass all known jewels. This\r\ninestimable stone is called the _n[=a]ga-m[=a]nik-kya_; but not one\r\nsnake in thousands is supposed to possess such a treasure. The cobra,\r\nbefore eating, is believed to cast it up and conceal it for the moment;\r\nelse its splendour, like a flambeau, would attract all beholders. The\r\ntales of the peasantry, in relation to it, all turn upon the devices of\r\nthose in search of the gem, and the vigilance and cunning of the cobra\r\nby which they are baffled; the reptile itself being more enamoured of\r\nthe priceless jewel than even its most ardent pursuers.\r\n\r\nIn BENNETT'S account of \"_Ceylon and its Capabilities_,\" there is\r\nanother curious piece of Singhalese folk-lore, to the effect, that the\r\ncobra de capello every time it expends its poison _loses a joint of its\r\ntail_, and eventually acquires a head resembling that of a toad. A\r\nrecent addition to zoological knowledge has thrown light on the origin\r\nof this popular fallacy. The family of \"false snakes\" (_pseudo\r\ntyphlops_, as Schlegel names the group) have till lately consisted of\r\nbut three species, of which only one was known to inhabit Ceylon. They\r\nbelong to a family intermediate between the serpents and that Saurian\r\ngroup-commonly called _Slow-worms_ or _Glass-snakes_; they in fact\r\nrepresent the slow-worms of the temperate regions in Ceylon. They have\r\nthe body of a snake, but the cleft of their mouth is very narrow, and\r\nthey are unable to detach the lateral parts of the lower jaw from each\r\nother, as the true snakes do when devouring a prey. The most striking\r\ncharacter of the group, however, is the size and form of the tail; this\r\nis very short, and according to the observations of Professor Peters of\r\nBerlin[1], shorter in the female than in the male. It does not terminate\r\nin a point as in other snakes, but is truncated obliquely, the abrupt\r\nsurface of its extremity being either entirely flat, or more or less\r\nconvex, and always covered with rough keels. The reptile assists its own\r\nmovements by pressing the rough end to the ground, and from this\r\npeculiar form of the tail, the family has received the name of\r\n_Uropeltidæ_, or \"Shield-tails.\" Within a very recent period important\r\nadditions have been made to this family. which now consists of four\r\ngenera and eleven species. Those occurring in Ceylon are enumerated in\r\nthe List appended to this chapter. One of these, the _Uropeltis grandis_\r\nof Kelaart[2], is distinguished by its dark brown colour, shot with a\r\nbluish metallic lustre, closely approaching the ordinary shade of the\r\ncobra; and the tail is abruptly and flatly compressed as though it had\r\nbeen severed by a knife. The form of this singular reptile will be best\r\nunderstood by a reference to the accompanying figure; and there can, I\r\nthink, be little doubt that to its strange and anomalous structure is to\r\nbe traced the fable of the transformation of the cobra de capello. The\r\ncolour alone would seem to identify the two reptiles, but the head and\r\nmouth are no longer those of a serpent, and the disappearance of the\r\ntail might readily suggest the mutilation which the tradition asserts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UROPELTIS PHILIPPINUS.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PETERS, _De Serpentum familia Uropeltaceorum_. Berol, 4.\r\n1861.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The _Uropeltis grandis_ of Kelaart, which was at first\r\nsupposed to be a new species, proves to be identical with _U.\r\nPhillippinus_ of Cuvier. It is doubtful, however, whether this species\r\nbe found in the Phillippine Islands, as stated by Cuvier; and it is more\r\nthan, probable that the typical specimen came from Ceylon--a further\r\nillustration of the affinity of the fauna of Ceylon to that of the\r\nEastern Archipelago. The characteristics of this reptile, as given by\r\nDr. GRAY, are as follows:--\"Caudal disc subcircular, with large\r\nscattered tubercles; snout subacute, slightly produced. Dark brown,\r\nlighter below, with some of the scales dark brown in the centre near the\r\nposterior edge. GRAY, _Proceed. Zool. Soc._ 1858, p. 262.]\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese Buddhists, in their religious abstinence from inflicting\r\ndeath on any creature, are accustomed, after securing a venomous snake,\r\nto enclose it in a basket woven of palm leaves, and to set it afloat on\r\na river.\r\n\r\n_The Python._--The great python[1] (the \"boa,\" as it is commonly\r\ndesignated by Europeans, the \"anaconda\" of Eastern story), which is\r\nsupposed to crush the bones of an elephant, and to swallow the tiger, is\r\nfound, though not of such portentous dimensions, in the cinnamon gardens\r\nwithin a mile of the fort of Colombo, where it feeds on hog-deer, and\r\nother smaller animals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Python reticulatus, _Gray_.]\r\n\r\nThe natives occasionally take it alive, and securing it to a pole expose\r\nit for sale as a curiosity. One that was brought to me tied in this way\r\nmeasured seventeen feet with a proportionate thickness: but one more\r\nfully grown, which crossed my path on a coffee estate on the Peacock\r\nMountain at Pusilawa, considerably exceeded these dimensions. Another\r\nwhich I watched in the garden at Elie House, near Colombo, surprised me\r\nby the ease with which it erected itself almost perpendicularly in order\r\nto scale a wall upwards of ten feet high.\r\n\r\nThe Singhalese assert that when it has swallowed a deer, or any animal\r\nof similarly inconvenient bulk, the python draws itself through the\r\nnarrow aperture between two trees, in order to crush the bones and\r\nassist in the process of deglutition.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular fact that the small and innocuous ground-snakes called\r\n_Calamariæ_, which abound on the continent of India and in the islands\r\nare not to be found in Ceylon; where they would appear to be replaced by\r\ntwo singular genera, the _Aspidura_ and _Haplocercus_, These latter have\r\nonly one series of shields below the tail, whilst most other harmless\r\nsnakes (_Calamaria_ included) have a double series of sub-candals. The\r\n_Aspidura_ has been known to naturalists for many years[1]; the\r\n_Haplocercus_ of Ceylon has only recently been described by Dr. Günther,\r\nand of it not more than three existing specimens are known: hence its\r\nhabits and the extent of its distribution over the island are still left\r\nin uncertainty.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Boie in Isis 1827 p. 517.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: GÜNTH. _Col. Snakes_, p. 14. In the hope that some inquirer\r\nin Ceylon will be able to furnish such information as may fill up this\r\nblank in the history of the haplocercus, the following particulars are\r\nhere appended. The largest of the specimens in the British Museum is\r\nabout twenty-five inches in length; the body thin, and much elongated;\r\nthe head narrow, and not distinct from the neck, the tail of moderate\r\nlength. Forehead covered by three shields, one anterior and two\r\nposterior frontals; no loreal shield; one small shield before, two\r\nbehind the eye; seven shields along the upper lip, the eye being above\r\nthe fourth. The scales are disposed in seventeen longitudinal series;\r\nthey are lanceolate and strongly keeled. The upper parts are uniform\r\nblackish or brown, with two dorsal rows of small indistinct black spots;\r\nocciput with a whitish collar, edged with darker. The lower parts\r\nuniform yellowish.]\r\n\r\nOf ten species of snakes that ascend trees in Ceylon to search for\r\nsquirrels and lizards, and to rifle the nests of birds, one half,\r\nincluding the green _carawala_, and the deadly _tic polonga_, are\r\nbelieved by the natives to be venomous; but the truth of this is very\r\ndubious. I have heard of the cobra being found on the crown of a\r\ncoco-nut palm, attracted, it was said, by the toddy which was flowing at\r\nthe time, it being the season for drawing it. Surrounding Elie House,\r\nnear Colombo, in which I resided, were a number of tall _casuarinas_ and\r\nIndia-rubber trees, whose branches almost touched the lattices of the\r\nwindow of the room in which I usually sat. These were a favourite resort\r\nof the tree-snakes, and in the early morning the numbers which clung to\r\nthem were sometimes quite remarkable. I had thus an opportunity of\r\nobserving the action of these creatures, which seems to me one of\r\nvigilance rather than of effort, the tongue being in perpetual activity,\r\nas if it were an organ of feeling; and in those in which the nose is\r\nelongated, a similar mobility and restlessness, especially when alarmed,\r\naffords evidence of the same faculty.\r\n\r\nThe general characteristic of the Tree-snake is an exceedingly thin and\r\ndelicate body, often adorned with colours exquisite as those of the\r\nfoliage amongst which they live concealed. In some of the South American\r\nspecies the tints vie in brilliancy with those of the humming-birds;\r\nwhilst their forms are so flexible and slender as to justify the name\r\nconferred on them of \"_whip-snakes_.\" The Siamese, to denote these\r\ncombinations of grace and splendour, call them \"Sun-beams.\" A\r\nnaturalist[1], describing a bright green species in Brazil (_Philodryas\r\nviridissimus_), writes: \"I am always delighted when I find that another\r\ntree-snake has settled in my garden. You look for a bird's nest, the\r\nyoung ones have gone, but you find their bed occupied by one of these\r\nbeautiful creatures, which will coil up its body of two feet in length\r\nwithin a space no larger than the hollow of your hand. They appear to be\r\nalways watchful; for at the instant you discover one, the quick playing\r\nof the long, black, forked tongue will show you that you too are\r\nobserved. On perceiving the slightest sign of your intention to disturb\r\nit, the snake will dart upwards through the branches and over the leaves\r\nwhich scarcely appear to bend beneath the weight. A moment more, and you\r\nhave lost sight of it. Whenever I return to Europe, you may be sure that\r\nin my hot-house those harmless, lovely creatures shall not be missing.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. WUCHERER of Bahia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TREE SNAKE. Passerita fusca.]\r\n\r\nCeylon has several species of Tree-snakes, and one of the most common is\r\nthe green _Passerita_, easily recognized from its bright colour and from\r\nthe pointed moveable appendage, into which the snout is prolonged. The\r\nsnakes of this genus being active chiefly during the night, the pupil of\r\nthe eye is linear and horizontal. They never willingly descend from\r\ntrees, but prey there upon nocturnal Saurians, geckoes, small birds and\r\ntheir young; and they are perfectly harmless, although they often try to\r\nbite. It is strange that none of the numerous specimens which it has\r\nbeen attempted to bring to Europe have ever fed in captivity; whilst in\r\nSouth America they take their food freely in confinement, provided that\r\nsome green plants are placed in their cage.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon I have never seen any specimen of a larger size than three\r\nfeet; whilst they are known to attain to more than five on the Indian\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nThe inference is obvious, that the green coloration of the majority of\r\ntree-snakes has more or less connection with their habits and mode of\r\nlife. Indeed, whenever a green-coloured snake is observed, it may at\r\nonce be pronounced, if slender or provided with a prehensile tail, to be\r\nof the kind which passes its life on trees; but if it be short-bodied\r\nthen it lives on the prairies. There are nevertheless tree-snakes which\r\nhave a very different coloration; and one of the most remarkable species\r\nis the _Passerita fusca_ or _Dryinus fuscus_, of which a figure is\r\nannexed. It closely resembles the green Passerita in form, so that\r\nnaturalists have considered it to be a mere variety. It is entirely of a\r\nshining brown, shot with purple, and the yellow longitudinal stripe\r\nwhich runs along the side of the belly of the green species, is absent\r\nin this one. It is much more rare than the green one, and does not\r\nappear to be found in Hindostan: no intermediate forms have been\r\nobserved in Ceylon.\r\n\r\n_Water-Snakes._--The fresh-water snakes, of which several species[1]\r\ninhabit the still waters and pools, are all harmless in Ceylon. A\r\ngentleman, who found near a river an agglutinated cluster of the eggs of\r\none variety (_Tropidophis schistosus_), placed them under a glass shade\r\non his drawing-room table, where one by one the young reptiles emerged\r\nfrom the shell to the number of twenty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Chersydrus granulatus, _Merr_.; Cerberus cinereus. _Daud._;\r\nTropidophis schistosus, _Daud._]\r\n\r\nThe _sea-snakes_ of the Indian tropics did not escape the notice of the\r\nearly Greek mariners who navigated those seas; and amongst the facts\r\ncollected by them, Ælian has briefly recorded that the Indian Ocean\r\nproduces serpents _with flattened tails_[1], whose bite, he adds, is to\r\nbe dreaded less for its venom than the laceration of its teeth. The\r\nfirst statement is accurate, but the latter is incorrect, as there is an\r\nall but unanimous concurrence of opinion that every species of this\r\nfamily of serpents is more or less poisonous. The compression of the\r\ntail noticed by Ælian is one of the principal characteristics of these\r\nreptiles, as their motion through the water is mainly effected by its\r\naid, coupled with the undulating movement of the rest of the body. Their\r\nscales, instead of being imbricated like those of land-snakes, form\r\nhexagons; and those on the belly, instead of being scutate and enlarged,\r\nare nearly of the same size and form as on other parts of the body.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"[Greek: Plateis tas ouras].\" ÆLIAN, L. xvi. c. 8.\r\n\r\nÆlian speaks elsewhere of fresh-water snakes. His remark on the\r\ncompression of the tail shows that his informants were aware of this\r\nspeciality in those that inhabit the sea.]\r\n\r\nSea-snakes (_Hydrophis_) are found on all the coasts of Ceylon. I have\r\nsailed through large shoals of them in the Gulf of Manaar, close to the\r\npearl-banks of Aripo. The fishermen of Calpentyn on the west live in\r\nperpetual dread of them, and believe their bite to be fatal. In the\r\ncourse of an attempt which was recently made to place a lighthouse on\r\nthe great rocks of the south-east coast, known by seamen as the\r\nBasses[1], or _Baxos_, the workmen who first landed found the portion of\r\nthe surface liable to be covered by the tides, honeycombed, and hollowed\r\ninto deep holes filled with water, in which were abundance of fishes and\r\nsome molluscs. Some of these cavities also contained sea-snakes from\r\nfour to five feet long, which were described as having the head \"hooded\r\nlike the cobra de capello, and of a light grey colour, slightly\r\nspeckled. They coiled themselves like serpents on land, and darted at\r\npoles thrust in among them. The Singhalese who accompanied the party,\r\nsaid that they not only bit venomously, but crushed the limb of any\r\nintruder in their coils.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Basses are believed to be the remnants of the great\r\nisland of Giri, swallowed up by the sea.--_Mahawanso_, ch. i. p. 4. They\r\nmay possibly be the _Bassæ_ of Ptolemy's map of _Taprobane_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Official Report to the Governor of Ceylon.]\r\n\r\nStill, sea-snakes, though well-known to the natives, are not abundant\r\nround Ceylon, as compared with their numbers in other places. Their\r\nprincipal habitat is the ocean between the southern shores of China and\r\nthe northern coast of New Holland; and their western limit appears to be\r\nabout the longitude of Cape Comorin. It has long since been ascertained\r\nthat they frequent the seas that separate the islands of the Pacific;\r\nbut they have never yet been found in the Atlantic, nor even on the\r\nwestern shores of tropical America. And if, as has been stated[1], they\r\nhave been seen on a late occasion in considerable numbers in the Bay of\r\nPanama, the fact can only be regarded as one of the rare instances, in\r\nwhich a change in the primary distribution of a race of animals has\r\noccurred, either by an active or a passive immigration. Being\r\nexclusively inhabitants of the sea, they are liable to be swept along by\r\nthe influence of currents; but to compensate for this they have been\r\nendowed with a wonderful power of swimming. The individuals of all the\r\ngroups of terrestrial serpents are observed to be possessed of this\r\nfaculty to a greater or a less degree; and they can swim for a certain\r\ndistance without having any organs specially modified for the purpose;\r\nexcept, perhaps, the lung, which is a long sac capable of taking in a\r\nsufficient quantity of air, to keep the body of the snake above water.\r\nNor do we find any peculiar or specially adapted organs even in the\r\nfreshwater-snakes, although they can catch frogs or fishes while\r\nswimming. But in the _hydrophids_, which are permanent inhabitants of\r\nthe ocean, and which in an adult state, approach the beach only\r\noccasionally, and for very short times, the tail, which is rounded and\r\ntapering in the others, is compressed into a vertical rudder-like organ,\r\nsimilar to, and answering all the purposes of, the caudal fin in a fish.\r\nWhen these snakes are brought on shore or on the deck of a ship, they\r\nare helpless and struggle vainly in awkward attitudes. Their food\r\nconsists exclusively of such fishes as are found near the surface; a\r\nfact which affords ample proof that they do not descend to great depths,\r\nalthough they can dive as well as swim. They are often found in groups\r\nduring calm weather, sleeping on the sea; but owing to their extreme\r\ncaution and shyness, attempts to catch them are rarely successful; on\r\nthe least alarm, they suddenly expel the air from their lungs and\r\ndescend below the surface; a long stream of rising air-bubbles marking\r\nthe rapid course which they make below. Their poisonous nature has been\r\nquestioned; but the presence of a strong perforated tooth and of a\r\nvenomous gland sufficiently attest their dangerous powers, even if these\r\nhad not been demonstrated by the effects of their bite. But fortunately\r\nfor the fishermen, who sometimes find them unexpectedly among the\r\ncontents of their nets, sea-snakes are unable, like other venomous\r\nserpents, to open the jaws widely, and in reality they rarely inflict a\r\nwound. Dr. Cantor believes, that, they are blinded by the light when\r\nremoved from their own element; and he adds that they become sluggish\r\nand speedily die.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Proc. Zool. Soc. 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Catal. Mal. Rept_. p. 136.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEA SNAKE Hydrophis subloevis]\r\n\r\nThose found near the coasts of Ceylon are generally small,--from one to\r\nthree feet in length, and apparently immature; and it is certain that\r\nthe largest specimens taken in the Pacific do not attain to greater\r\nlength than eight feet. In colour they are generally of a greenish\r\nbrown, in parts inclining to yellow, with occasionally cross bands of\r\nblack. The species figured in the accompanying drawing is the _Hydrophis\r\nsubloevis_ of Gray; or _Hydrus cyanocinctus_ of Boie.[1] The specimen\r\nfrom which the drawing is taken, was obtained by Dr. Templeton at\r\nColombo.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Its technical characteristics are as follows,--Body rather\r\nslender; ground colour yellowish with irregular black rings. Scales\r\nnearly smooth; ventral plates broad, six-sided, smooth, some divided\r\ninto two, by a slight central groove. Occipital shields large,\r\ntriangular, and produced, with a small central shield behind them; a\r\nseries of four large temporal shields; chin shields in two pairs; eyes\r\nvery small, over the fourth and fifth labials; one ante-and two\r\npost-oculars; the second upper labial shield elongated.]\r\n\r\nThe use of the Pamboo-Kaloo, or snake-stone, as a remedy in cases of\r\nwounds by venomous serpents, has probably been communicated to the\r\nSinghalese by the itinerant snake-charmers who resort to the island from\r\nthe coast of Coromandel; and more than one well-authenticated instance\r\nof its successful application has been told to me by persons who had\r\nbeen eye-witnesses to what they described. On one occasion, in March,\r\n1854, a friend of mine was riding, with some other civil officers of the\r\nGovernment, along a jungle path in the vicinity of Bintenne, when he saw\r\none of two Tamils, who were approaching the party, suddenly dart into\r\nthe forest and return, holding in both hands a cobra de capello which he\r\nhad seized by the head and tail. He called to his companion for\r\nassistance to place it in their covered basket, but, in doing this, he\r\nhandled it so inexpertly that it seized him by the finger, and retained\r\nits hold for a few seconds, as if unable to retract its fangs. The blood\r\nflowed, and intense pain appeared to follow almost immediately; but,\r\nwith all expedition, the friend of the sufferer undid his waistcloth,\r\nand took from it two snake-stones, each of the size of a small almond,\r\nintensely black and highly polished, though of an extremely light\r\nsubstance. These he applied, one to each wound inflicted by the teeth of\r\nthe serpent, to which they attached themselves closely; the blood that\r\noozed from the bites being rapidly imbibed by the porous texture of the\r\narticle applied. The stones adhered tenaciously for three or four\r\nminutes, the wounded man's companion in the meanwhile rubbing his arm\r\ndownwards from the shoulder towards the fingers. At length the\r\nsnake-stones dropped off of their own accord; the suffering of the man\r\nappeared to subside; he twisted his fingers till the joints cracked, and\r\nwent on his way without concern. Whilst this had been going on, another\r\nIndian of the party who had come up took from his bag a small piece of\r\nwhite wood, which resembled a root, and passed it gently near the head\r\nof the cobra, which the latter immediately inclined close to the ground;\r\nhe then lifted the snake without hesitation, and coiled it into a circle\r\nat the bottom of his basket. The root by which he professed to be\r\nenabled to perform this operation with safety he called the _Naya-thalic\r\nKalanga_ (the root of the snake-plant), protected by which he professed\r\nhis ability to approach any reptile with impunity.\r\n\r\nIn another instance, in 1853, Mr. Lavalliere, then District Judge of\r\nKandy, informed me that he saw a snake-charmer in the jungle, close by\r\nthe town, search for a cobra de capello, and, after disturbing one in\r\nits retreat, the man tried to secure it, but, in the attempt, he was\r\nbitten in the thigh till blood trickled from the wound. He instantly\r\napplied the _Pamboo-Kaloo_, which adhered closely for about ten minutes,\r\nduring which time he passed the root which he held in his hand backwards\r\nand forwards above the stone, till the latter dropped to the ground. He\r\nassured Mr. Lavalliere that all danger was then past. That gentleman\r\nobtained from him the snake-stone he had relied on, and saw him\r\nrepeatedly afterwards in perfect health.\r\n\r\nThe substances used on both these occasions are now in my possession.\r\nThe roots employed by the several parties are not identical. One appears\r\nto be a bit of the stem of an Aristolochia; the other is so dried as to\r\nrender its identification difficult, but it resembles the quadrangular\r\nstem of a jungle vine. Some species of Aristolochia, such as the _A.\r\nserpentaria_ of North America, are supposed to act as specifics in the\r\ncure of snakebites; and the _A. indica_ is the plant to which the\r\nichneumon is popularly believed to resort as an antidote when bitten[1];\r\nbut it is probable that the use of any particular plant by the\r\nsnake-charmers is a pretence, or rather a delusion, the reptile being\r\noverpowered by the resolute action of the operator[2], and not by the\r\ninfluence of any secondary appliance. In other words, the confidence\r\ninspired by the supposed talisman enables its possessor to address\r\nhimself fearlessly to his task, and thus to effect, by determination and\r\nwill, what is popularly believed to be the result of charms and\r\nstupefaction. Still it is curious that, amongst the natives of Northern\r\nAfrica, who lay hold of the _Cerastes_ without fear or hesitation,\r\nimpunity is ascribed to the use of a plant with the juice of which they\r\nanoint themselves before touching the reptile[3]; and Bruce says of the\r\npeople of Sennar, that they acquire exemption from the fatal\r\nconsequences of the bite by chewing a particular root, and washing\r\nthemselves with an infusion of certain plants. He adds that a portion of\r\nthis root was given him, with a view to test its efficacy in his own\r\nperson, but that he had not sufficient resolution to make the\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an account of the encounter between the ichneumon and\r\nthe venomous snakes of Ceylon, see Ch. I. p. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The following narrative of the operations of a\r\nsnake-charmer in Ceylon is contained in a note from Mr. Reyne, of the\r\ndepartment of public works: \"A snake-charmer came to my bungalow in\r\n1851, requesting me to allow him to show me his snakes dancing. As I had\r\nfrequently seen them, I told him I would give him a rupee if he would\r\naccompany me to the jungle, and catch a cobra, that I knew frequented\r\nthe place. He was willing, and as I was anxious to test the truth of the\r\ncharm, I counted his tame snakes, and put a watch over them until I\r\nreturned with him. Before going I examined the man, and satisfied myself\r\nhe had no snake about his person. When we arrived at the spot, he played\r\non a small pipe, and after persevering for some time out came a large\r\ncobra from an ant hill, which I knew it occupied. On seeing the man it\r\ntried to escape, but he caught it by the tail and kept swinging it round\r\nuntil we reached the bungalow. He then made it dance, but before long it\r\nbit him above the knee. He immediately bandaged the leg above the bite,\r\nand applied a snake-stone to the wound to extract the poison. He was in\r\ngreat pain for a few minutes, but after that it gradually went away, the\r\nstone falling off just before he was relieved. When he recovered he held\r\na cloth up which the snake flew at, and caught its fangs in it; while in\r\nthat position, the man passed his hand up its back, and having seized it\r\nby the throat, he extracted the fangs in my presence and gave them to\r\nme. He then squeezed out the poison on to a leaf. It was a clear oily\r\nsubstance, and when rubbed on the hand produced a fine lather. I\r\ncarefully watched the whole operation, which was also witnessed by my\r\nclerk and two or three other persons. _Colombo, 13th January_\r\n1860.--H.E. REYNE.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Hasselquist.]\r\n\r\nAs to the snake-stone itself, I submitted one, the application of which\r\nI have been describing, to Mr. Faraday, who has communicated to me, as\r\nthe result of his analysis, his belief that it is \"a piece of charred\r\nbone which has been filled with blood perhaps several times, and then\r\ncarefully charred again. Evidence of this is afforded, as well by the\r\napertures of cells or tubes on its surface as by the fact that it yields\r\nand breaks, under pressure; and exhibits an organic structure within.\r\nWhen heated slightly, water rises from it, and also a little ammonia;\r\nand, if heated still more highly in the air, carbon burns away, and a\r\nbulky white ash is left, retaining the shape and size of the stone.\"\r\nThis ash, as is evident from inspection, cannot have belonged toany\r\nvegetable substance, for it is almost entirely composed of phosphate of\r\nlime. Mr. Faraday adds that \"if the piece of matter has ever been\r\nemployed as a spongy absorbent, it seems hardly fit for that purpose in\r\nits present state: but who can say to what treatment it has been\r\nsubjected since it was fit for use, or to what treatment the natives may\r\nsubmit it when expecting to have occasion to use it?\"\r\n\r\nThe probability is, that the animal charcoal, when instantaneously\r\napplied, may be sufficiently porous and absorbent to extract the venom\r\nfrom the recent wound, together with a portion of the blood, before it\r\nhas had time to be carried into the system; and that the blood which Mr.\r\nFaraday detected in the specimen submitted to him was that of the Indian\r\non whose person the effect was exhibited on the occasion to which my\r\ninformant was an eye-witness. The snake-charmers from the coast who\r\nvisit Ceylon profess to prepare the snake-stones for themselves, and to\r\npreserve the composition a secret. Dr. Davy[1], on the authority of Sir\r\nAlexander Johnston, says the manufacture of them is a lucrative trade,\r\ncarried on by the monks of Manilla, who supply the merchants of\r\nIndia--and his analysis confirms that of Mr. Faraday. Of the three\r\ndifferent kinds which he examined--one being of partially burnt bone,\r\nand another of chalk, the third, consisting chiefly of vegetable matter,\r\nresembled bezoar,--all of them (except the first, which possessed a\r\nslight absorbent power) were quite inert, and incapable of having any\r\neffect except on the imagination of the patient. Thunberg was shown the\r\nsnake-stone used by the boers at the Cape in 1772, which was imported\r\nfor them \"from the Indies, especially from Malabar,\" at so high a price\r\nthat few of the farmers could afford to possess themselves of it; he\r\ndescribes it as convex on one side, black and so porous that \"when\r\nthrown into water, it caused bubbles to rise;\" and hence, by its\r\nabsorbent qualities, it served, if speedily applied, to extract the\r\npoison from the wound.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Account of the Interior of Ceylon_, ch. iii. p. 101.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Thunberg_, vol. i. p. 155. Since the foregoing account was\r\npublished, I have received a note from Mr. HARDY, relative to the\r\n_piedra ponsona_, the snake-stone of Mexico, in which he gives the\r\nfollowing account of the method of preparing and applying it: \"Take a\r\npiece of hart's horn of any convenient size and shape; cover it well\r\nround with grass or hay, enclose both in a thin piece of sheet copper\r\nwell wrapped round them, and place the parcel in a charcoal fire till\r\nthe bone is sufficiently charred.\r\n\r\n\"When cold, remove the calcined horn from its envelope, when it will be\r\nready for immediate use. In this state it will resemble a solid black\r\nfibrous substance, of the same shape and size as before it was subjected\r\nto this treatment.\r\n\r\n\"USE.--The wound being slightly punctured, apply the bone to the\r\nopening, to which it will adhere firmly for the space of two minutes;\r\nand when it falls, it should be received into a basin of water. It\r\nshould then be dried in a cloth, and again applied to the wound. But it\r\nwill not adhere longer than about one minute. In like manner it may be\r\napplied a third time; but now it will fall almost immediately, and\r\nnothing will cause it to adhere any more.\r\n\r\n\"These effects I witnessed in the case of a bite of a rattle-snake at\r\nOposura, a town in the province of Sonora, in Mexico, from whence I\r\nobtained my recipe; and I have given other particulars respecting it in\r\nmy Travels in the Interior of Mexico, published in 1830.

HARDY.\r\n_Bath_, 30_th January_, 1860.\"]\r\n\r\n_Coecilia_.--The rocky jungle, bordering the higher coffee estates,\r\nprovides a safe retreat for a very singular animal, first introduced to\r\nthe notice of European naturalists about a century ago by Linnæus, who\r\ngave it the name _Coecilia glutinosa_, to indicate two peculiarities\r\nmanifest to the ordinary observer--an apparent defect of vision, from\r\nthe eyes being so small and embedded as to be scarcely distinguishable;\r\nand a power of secreting from minute pores in the skin a viscous fluid,\r\nresembling that of snails, eels, and some salamanders. Specimens are\r\nrare in Europe owing to the readiness with which it decomposes, breaking\r\ndown into a flaky mass in the spirits in which it is attempted to\r\npreserve it.\r\n\r\nThe creature is about the length and thickness of an ordinary round desk\r\nruler, a little flattened before and rounded behind. It is brownish,\r\nwith a pale stripe along either side. The skin is furrowed into 350\r\ncircular folds, in which are imbedded minute scales. The head is\r\ntolerably distinct, with a double row of fine curved teeth for seizing\r\nthe insects and worms on which it is supposed to live.\r\n\r\nNaturalists are most desirous that the habits and metamorphoses of this\r\ncreature should be carefully ascertained, for great doubts have been\r\nentertained as to the position it is entitled to occupy in the chain of\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n_Batrachians._--In the numerous marshes formed by the overflowing of the\r\nrivers in the plains of the low country, there are many varieties of\r\nfrogs, which, both by their colours and by their extraordinary size, are\r\ncalculated to excite the surprise of a stranger. In the lakes around\r\nColombo and the still water near Trincomalie, there are huge creatures\r\nof this family, from six to eight inches in length[1], of an olive hue,\r\ndeepening into brown on the back and yellow on the under side. A Kandyan\r\nspecies, recently described, is of much smaller dimensions, but\r\ndistinguished by its brilliant colouring, a beautiful grass green above\r\nand deep orange underneath[2].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A Singhalese variety of the _Rana cutipora?_ and the\r\nMalabar bull-frog, _Hylarana Malabarica_. A frog named by BLYTH _Rana\r\nrobusta_ proves to be a Ceylon specimen of the _R. cutipora_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _R. Kandiana_, Kelaart.]\r\n\r\nIn the shrubberies around my house at Colombo the graceful little\r\ntree-frogs[1] were to be found in great numbers, sheltered under broad\r\nleaves to protect them from the scorching sun;--some of them utter a\r\nsharp metallic sound at night, similar to that produced by smacking the\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Polypedates maculatus,_ Gray.]\r\n\r\nIn the gardens and grounds toads[1] crouch in the shade, and pursue the\r\nflies and minute coleoptera. In Ceylon, as in Europe, these creatures\r\nsuffer from the bad renown of injecting a poison into the wound\r\ninflicted by their bite.[2] The main calumny is confuted by the fact\r\nthat no toad has yet been discovered furnished with any teeth\r\nwhatsoever; but the obnoxious repute still attaches to the milky\r\nexudation sometimes perceptible from glands situated on either side\r\nbehind the head; nevertheless experiments have shown, that though acrid,\r\nthe secretions of the toad are incapable of exciting more than a slight\r\nerythema on the most delicate skins. The smell is, however, fetid and\r\noffensive, and hence toads are less exposed to the attacks of\r\ncarnivorous animals and of birds than frogs, in which such glands do not\r\nexist.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Bufo melanostictus_, Schneid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In Ceylon this error is as old as the third century, B.C.,\r\nwhen, as the _Mahawanso_ tells us, the wife of \"King Asoka attempted to\r\ndestroy the great bo-tree (at Magadha) _with, the poisoned fang of a\r\ntoad._\"--Ch. xx. p. 122.]\r\n\r\nIn the class of Reptiles, those only are included in the order of\r\nBatrachians which undergo a metamorphosis before attaining maturity; and\r\nas they offer the only example amongst Vertebrate animals of this\r\nmarvellous transformation, they are justly considered as the lowest in\r\nthe scale, with the exception of fishes, which remain during life in\r\nthat stage of development which is only the commencement of existence to\r\na frog.\r\n\r\nIn undergoing this change, it is chiefly the organs of respiration that\r\nmanifest alteration. In its earliest form the young batrachian, living\r\nin the water, breathes as a fish does by _gills_, either free and\r\nprojecting as in the water-newt, or partially covered by integument as\r\nin the tadpole. But the gills disappear as the lungs gradually become\r\ndeveloped: the duration of the process being on an average one hundred\r\ndays from the time the eggs were first deposited. After this important\r\nchange, the true batrachian is incapable any longer of living\r\ncontinuously in water, and either betakes itself altogether to the land,\r\nor seeks the surface from time to time to replenish its exhausted\r\nlungs.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A few Batrachians, such as the _Siren_ of Carolina, the\r\n_Proteus_ of Illyria, the _Axolotl_ of Mexico, and the _Menobranchus_ of\r\nthe North American Lakes, retain their gills during life; but although\r\nprovided with lungs in mature age, they are not capable of living out of\r\nthe water. Such batrachians form an intermediate link between reptiles\r\nand fishes.]\r\n\r\nThe change in the digestive functions during metamorphosis is scarcely\r\nless extraordinary; frogs, for example, which feed on animal substances\r\nat maturity, subsist entirely upon vegetable when in the condition of\r\nlarvæ, and the subsidiary organs undergo remarkable development, the\r\nintestinal canal in the earlier stage being five times its length in the\r\nlater one.\r\n\r\nOf the family of tailed batrachians, Ceylon does not furnish a single\r\nexample; but of those without this appendage, the island, as above\r\nremarked, affords many varieties; seven distinguishable species\r\npertaining to the genus _rana_, or true frogs with webs to the hind\r\nfeet; two to the genus _bufo_, or true toads, and five to the\r\n_Polypedates_, or East Indian \"tree-frogs;\" besides a few others in\r\nallied genera. The \"tree-frog,\" whose toes are terminated by rounded\r\ndiscs which assist it in climbing, possesses, in a high degree, the\r\nfaculty of changing its hues; and one as green as a leaf to-day, will be\r\nfound grey and spotted like the bark to-morrow.

Little has been done in the examination\r\nand description of its fishes, especially those which frequent the\r\nrivers and inland waters. Mr. BENNETT, who was for some years employed\r\nin the Civil Service, directed his attention to the subject, and\r\npublished in 1830 some portions of a projected work on the marine fishes\r\nof the island[1], but it never proceeded beyond the description of\r\nthirty individuals. The great work of Cuvier and Valenciennes[2]\r\nparticularises about one hundred species, specimens of which were\r\nprocured from Ceylon by Reynard, Leschenault and other correspondents;\r\nbut of these not more than half a dozen belong to fresh water.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _A Selection of the most Remarkable and Interesting Fishes\r\nfound on the Coast of Ceylon._ By J.W. BENNETT, Esp. London, 1830.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Histoire Naturelle des Poissons._]\r\n\r\nThe fishes of the coast, as far as they have been examined, present few\r\nthat are not in all probability common to the seas of Ceylon and India.\r\nA series of drawings, including upwards of six hundred species and\r\nvarieties of Ceylon fish, all made from recently-captured specimens,\r\nhave been submitted to Professor Huxley, and a notice of their general\r\ncharacteristics forms an interesting appendix to the present chapter.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See note B appended to this chapter.]\r\n\r\nOf those in ordinary use for the table the finest by far is the\r\nSeir-fish[1], a species of Scomberoids, which is called _Tora-malu_ by\r\nthe natives. It is in size and form very similar to the salmon, to which\r\nthe flesh of the female fish, notwithstanding its white colour, bears a\r\nvery close resemblance both in firmness and flavour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Cybium_ (_Scomber_, Linn.) _guttatum_.]\r\n\r\nMackerel, carp, whitings, mullet both red and striped, perches and soles\r\nare abundant, and a sardine (_Sardinella Neohowii_, Val.) frequents the\r\nsouthern and eastern coast in such profusion that in one instance in\r\n1839, a gentleman who was present saw upwards of four hundred thousand\r\ntaken in a haul of the nets in the little bay of Goyapanna, east of\r\nPoint-de-Galle. As this vast shoal approached the shore the broken water\r\nbecame as smooth as if a sheet of ice had been floating below the\r\nsurface.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: These facts serve to explain the story told by the friar\r\nODORIC of Friuli, who visited Ceylon about the year 1320 A.D., and says\r\nthere are \"fishes in those seas that come swimming towards the said\r\ncountry in such abundance that for a great distance into the sea nothing\r\ncan be seen but the backs of fishes, which casting themselves on the\r\nshore, do suffer men for the space of three daies to come and to take as\r\nmany of them as they please, and then they return again into the\r\nsea.\"--_Hakluyt_, vol. ii. p. 57.]\r\n\r\n_Poisonous Fishes._--The sardine has the reputation of being poisonous\r\nat certain seasons, and accidents ascribed to eating it are recorded in\r\nall parts of the island. Whole families of fishermen who have partaken\r\nof it have died. Twelve persons in the jail of Chilaw were thus\r\npoisoned, about the year 1829; and the deaths of soldiers have\r\nrepeatedly been ascribed to the same cause. It is difficult in such\r\ninstances to say with certainty whether the fish were in fault; whether\r\nthere was not a peculiar susceptibility in the condition of the\r\nrecipients; or whether the mischief may not have been occasioned by the\r\nwilful administration of poison, or its accidental occurrence in the\r\nbrass cooking vessels used by the natives. The popular belief was,\r\nhowever, deferred to by an order passed by the Governor in Council in\r\nFebruary, 1824, which, after reciting that \"Whereas it appears by\r\ninformation conveyed to the Government that at three several periods at\r\nTrincomalie, death has been the consequence to several persons from\r\neating the fish called Sardinia during the months of January and\r\nDecember,\" enacts that it shall not be lawful in that district to catch\r\nsardines during these months, under pain of fine and imprisonment. This\r\norder is still in force, but the fishing continues notwithstanding.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There are other species of Sardine found at Ceylon besides\r\nthe _S. Neohowii_; such as the _S. lineolata_, Cuv. and Val. and the _S.\r\nleiogaster_, Cuv. and Val. xx. 270, which was found by M. Reynaud at\r\nTrincomalie. It occurs also off the coast of Java. Another Ceylon fish\r\nof the same group, a Clupea, is known as the \"poisonous sprat;\" the\r\nbonito (_Thynnus affinis_, Cang.), the kangewena, or unicorn fish\r\n(_Balistes?_), and a number of others, are more or less in bad repute\r\nfrom the same imputation.]\r\n\r\n_Sharks._--Sharks appear on all parts of the coast, and instances\r\ncontinually occur of persons being seized by them whilst bathing even in\r\nthe harbours of Trincomalie and Colombo. In the Gulf of Manaar they are\r\ntaken for the sake of their oil, of which they yield such a quantity\r\nthat \"shark's oil\" is a recognised export. A trade also exists in drying\r\ntheir fins, for which, owing to the gelatine contained in them, a ready\r\nmarket is found in China; whither the skin of the basking shark is also\r\nsent, to be converted, it is said, into shagreen.\r\n\r\n_Saw Fish._--The huge _Pristis antiquorum_[1] infests the eastern coast\r\nof the island, where it attains a length of from twelve to fifteen feet,\r\nincluding the serrated rostrum from which its name is derived. This\r\npowerful weapon seems designed to compensate for the inadequacy of the\r\nordinary maxillary teeth which are unusually small, obtuse, and\r\ninsufficient to capture and kill the animals which form the food of this\r\npredatory shark. To remedy this, the fore part of the head and its\r\ncartilages are prolonged into a flattened plate, the length of which is\r\nnearly equal to one third of the whole body, its edges being armed with\r\nformidable teeth, that are never shed or renewed, but increase in size\r\nwith the growth of the creature.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Two other species are found in the Ceylon waters, _P.\r\ncuspidatus_ and _P. pectinatus_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF THE SAWFISH (PRISTIS ANTIQUORUM)]\r\n\r\nThe _Rays_ form a large tribe of cartilaginous fishes in which, although\r\nthe skeleton is not osseous, the development of organs is so advanced\r\nthat they would appear to be the highest of the class, approaching\r\nnearest to amphibians. They are easily distinguished from the sharks by\r\ntheir broad and flat body, the pectoral fins being expanded like wings\r\non each side of the trunk. They are all inhabitants of the ocean, and\r\nsome grow to a prodigious size. Specimens have been caught of twenty\r\nfeet in breadth. These, however, are of rare occurrence, as such huge\r\nmonsters usually retreat into the depths of the sea, where they are\r\nsecure from the molestation of man. It is, generally speaking, only the\r\nyoung and the smaller species that approach the coasts, where they find\r\na greater supply of those marine animals which form their food. The Rays\r\nhave been divided into several generic groups, and the one of which a\r\ndrawing (_Aëtobates narinari_[1]) is given, has very marked\r\ncharacteristics in its produced snout, pointed and winged-like pectoral\r\nfins, and exceedingly long, flagelliform tail. The latter is armed with\r\na strong, serrated spine, which is always broken off by the fishermen\r\nimmediately on capture, under the impression that wounds inflicted by it\r\nare poisonous. Their fears, however, are utterly groundless, as the ray\r\nhas no gland for secreting any venomous fluid. The apprehension may,\r\nhowever, have originated in the fact that a lacerated wound such as\r\nwould be produced by a serrated spine, is not unlikely to assume a\r\nserious character, under the influence of a tropical climate. The\r\nspecies figured on the last page is brownish-olive on the upper surface,\r\nwith numerous greenish-white round spots, darkening towards the edges.\r\nThe anterior annulations of the tail are black and white, the posterior\r\nentirely black. Its mouth is transverse and paved with a band of\r\nflattened teeth calculated to crush the hard shells of the animals on\r\nwhich it feeds. It moves slowly along the bottom in search of its food,\r\nwhich consists of crustacea and mollusca, and seems to be unable to\r\ncatch fishes or other quickly moving animals. Specimens have been taken\r\nnear Ceylon, of six feet in width. Like most deep-sea fishes, the ray\r\nhas a wide geographical range, and occurs not only in all the Indian\r\nOcean, but also in the tropical tracts of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RAY (AËTOBATES NARINARI).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Raja narinari_, Bl. Schn. p. 361. _Aëtobates narinari_,\r\nMüll. und Henle., Plagiost. p. 179.]\r\n\r\nAnother armed fish, renowned since the times of Ælian and Pliny for its\r\ncourage in attacking the whale, and even a ship, is the sword-fish\r\n(_Xiphias gladius_).[1] Like the thunny and bonito, it is an inhabitant\r\nof the deeper seas, and, though known in the Mediterranean, is chiefly\r\nconfined to the tropics. The dangerous weapon with which nature has\r\nequipped it is formed by the prolongation and intertexture of the bones\r\nof the upper jaw into an exceedingly compact cylindrical protuberance,\r\nsomewhat flattened at the base, but tapering to a sharp point. In\r\nstrange inconsistence with its possession of so formidable an armature,\r\nthe general disposition of the sword-fish is represented to be gentle\r\nand inoffensive; and although the fact of its assaults upon the whale\r\nhas been incontestably established, yet the motive for such conflicts,\r\nand the causes of its enmity, are beyond conjecture. Competition for\r\nfood is out of the question, as the Xiphias can find its own supplies\r\nwithout rivalry on the part of its gigantic antagonist; and as to\r\nconverting the whale itself into food, the sword-fish, from the\r\nconstruction of its mouth and the small size of its teeth, is quite\r\nincapable of feeding on animals of such dimensions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: ÆLIAN tells a story of a ship in the Black Sea, the bottom\r\nof which was penetrated by the sword of a _Xiphias_ (L. xiv. c. 23); and\r\nPLINY (L. xxxii. c. 8) speaks of a similar accident on the coast of\r\nMauritania. In the British Museum there is a specimen of a plank of oak,\r\npierced by a sword-fish, and still retaining the broken weapon.]\r\n\r\nIn the seas around Ceylon sword-fishes sometimes attain to the length of\r\ntwenty feet, and are distinguished by the unusual height of the dorsal\r\nfin. Those both of the Atlantic and Mediterranean possess this fin in\r\nits full proportions, only during the earlier stages of their growth.\r\nIts dimensions even then are much smaller than in the Indian species;\r\nand it is a curious fact that it gradually decreases as the fish\r\napproaches to maturity; whereas in the seas around Ceylon, it retains\r\nits full size throughout the entire period of life. They raise it above\r\nthe water, whilst dashing along the surface in their rapid course; and\r\nthere is no reason to doubt that it occasionally acts as a sail.\r\n\r\nThe Indian species (which are provided with two long and filamentous\r\nventral fins) have been formed into the genus _Histiophorus_; to which\r\nbelongs the individual figured on the next page. It is distinguished\r\nfrom others most closely allied to it, by having the immense dorsal fin\r\nof one uniform dark violet colour; whilst in its congeners, it is\r\nspotted with blue. The fish from which the engraving has been made, was\r\nprocured by Dr. Templeton, near Colombo. The species was previously\r\nknown only by a single specimen captured in the Red Sea, by Rüppell, who\r\nconferred upon it the specific designation of \"_immaculatus_.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Trans. Zool. Soc. ii. p. 71. Pl. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SWORD FISH (MISMOPHORUS IMMACULATUS).]\r\n\r\nÆlian, in his graphic account of the strange forms presented by the\r\nfishes inhabiting the seas around Ceylon, says that one in particular is\r\nso grotesque in its configuration, that no painter would venture to\r\ndepict it; its main peculiarity being that it has feet or claws rather\r\nthan fins.[1] The annexed drawing[2] may probably represent the creature\r\nto which the informants of Ælian referred. It is a cheironectes; one of\r\na group in which the bones of the carpus form arms that support the\r\npectoral fins, and enable these fishes to walk along the moist ground,\r\nalmost like quadrupeds.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: [Greek: Podas ge mên chêlas ê pterygia.]--Lib. xvi. c. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The fish from which this drawing of the _Cheironectes_ was\r\nmade, was taken near Colombo, and from the peculiarities which it\r\npresents it is in all probability a new and undescribed species. Dr.\r\nGÜNTHER has remarked, that in it, whilst the first and second dorsal\r\nspines are situated as usual over the eye (and form, one the angling\r\nbait of the fish, the other the crest above the nose), the third is at\r\nan unusual distance from the second, and is not separated, as in the\r\nother species, from the soft fin by a notch.]\r\n\r\nThey belong to the family of _Lophiads_ or \"anglers,\" not unfrequent on\r\nthe English coast; which conceal themselves in the mud, displaying only\r\nthe erectile ray, situated on the head, which bears an excrescence on\r\nits extremity resembling a worm; by agitating which, they attract the\r\nsmaller fishes, that thus become an easy prey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHEIRONECTES]\r\n\r\nOn the rocks in Ceylon which are washed by the surf there are quantities\r\nof the curious little fish, _Salarius alticus_[1], which possesses the\r\nfaculty of darting along the surface of the water, and running up the\r\nwet stones, with the utmost ease and rapidity. By aid of the pectoral\r\nand ventral fins and gill-cases, they move across the damp sand, ascend\r\nthe roots of the mangroves, and climb up the smooth face of the rocks in\r\nsearch of flies; adhering so securely as not to be detached by repeated\r\nassaults of the waves. These little creatures are so nimble, that it is\r\nalmost impossible to lay hold of them, as they scramble to the edge, and\r\nplunge into the sea on the slightest attempt to molest them. They are\r\nfrom three to four inches in length, and of a dark brown colour, almost\r\nundistinguishable from the rocks they frequent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cuv. and VALEN., _Hist. Nat. des Poissons_, tom. xi. p.\r\n249. It is identical with _S. tridactylus,_ Schn.]\r\n\r\nBut the most striking to the eye of a stranger are those fishes whose\r\nbrilliancy of colouring has won for them the wonder even of the listless\r\nSinghalese. Some, like the Red Sea Perch (_Holocentrum rubrum_, Forsk)\r\nand the Great Fire Fish[1], are of the deepest scarlet and flame colour;\r\nin others purple predominates, as in the _Serranus flavo-cæruleus_; in\r\nothers yellow, as in the _Choetodon Brownriggii_[2], and _Acanthurus\r\nvittatus_, of Bennett[3], and numbers, from the lustrous green of their\r\nscales, have obtained from the natives the appropriate name of\r\n_Giraway_, or _parrots_, of which one, the _Sparus Hardwickii_ of\r\nBennett, is called the \"Flower Parrot,\" from its exquisite colouring,\r\nbeing barred with irregular bands of blue, crimson, and purple, green,\r\nyellow, and grey, and crossed by perpendicular stripes of black.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Pterois muricata_, Cuv. and Val. iv. 363. _Scarpæna\r\nmiles_, Bennett; named, by the Singhalese, \"_Maharata-gini_,\" the Great\r\nRed Fire, a very brilliant red species spotted with black. It is very\r\nvoracious, and is regarded on some parts of the coast as edible, while\r\non others it is rejected.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Glyphisodon Brownriggii_, Cuv. and Val. v. 484; _Choetodon\r\nBrownriggii_, Bennett. A very small fish about two inches long, called\r\n_Kaha hartikyha_ by the natives. It is distinct from Choetodon, in which\r\nBENNETT placed it. Numerous species of this genus are scattered\r\nthroughout the Indian Ocean. It derives its name from the fine hair-like\r\ncharacter of its teeth. They are found chiefly among coral reefs, and,\r\nthough eaten, are not much esteemed. In the French colonies they are\r\ncalled \"Chauffe-soleil.\" One species is found on the shores of the New\r\nWorld (_G. saxatalis_), and it is curious that Messrs. QUOY and GAIMARD\r\nfound this fish at the Cape de Verde Islands in 1827.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: This fish has a sharp round spine on the side of the body\r\nnear the tail; a formidable weapon, which is generally partially\r\nconcealed within a scabbard-like incision. It raises or depresses this\r\nspine at pleasure. The fish is yellow, with several nearly parallel blue\r\nstripes on the back and sides; the belly is white, the tail and fins\r\nbrownish green, edged with blue.\r\n\r\nIt is found in rocky places; and according to BENNETT, who has figured\r\nit in his second plate, it is named _Seweya_. It has been known,\r\nhowever, to all the old ichthyologists, Valentyn, Renard, Seba, Artedi,\r\nand has been named _Chætodon lineatus_, by Linné. It is scarce on the\r\nsouthern coast of Ceylon.]\r\n\r\nOf these richly coloured fishes the most familiar in the Indian seas are\r\nthe _Pteroids_. They are well known on the coast of Africa, and thence\r\neastward to Polynesia; but they do not extend to the west coast of\r\nAmerica, and are utterly absent from the Atlantic. The rays of the\r\ndorsal and pectoral fins are so elongated, that when specimens were\r\nfirst brought to Europe it was conjectured that these fishes have the\r\nfaculty of flight, and hence the specific name of \"_volitans_\" But this\r\nis an error, for, owing to the deep incisions between the pectoral rays,\r\nthe pteroids are wholly unable to sustain themselves in the air. They\r\nare not even bold swimmers, living close to the shore and never\r\nventuring into the deep sea. Their head is ornamented with a number of\r\nfilaments and cutaneous appendages, of which one over each eye and\r\nanother at the angles of the mouth are the most conspicuous. Sharp\r\nspines project on the crown and on the side of the gill-apparatus, as in\r\nthe other sea-perches, _Scorpæna, Serranus_, &c., of which these are\r\nonly a modified and ornate form. The extraordinary expansion of their\r\nfins is not, however, accompanied by a similar development of the bones\r\nto which they are attached, simply because they appear to have no\r\npeculiar function, as in flying fishes, or in those where the spines of\r\nthe fins are weapons of offence. They attain to the length of twelve\r\ninches, and to a weight of about two pounds; they live on small marine\r\nanimals, and by the Singhalese the flesh (of some at least) is\r\nconsidered good for table. Nine or ten species are known to occur in the\r\nEast Indian Seas, and of these the one figured above is, perhaps, the\r\nmost common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PTEROIS VOLITANS.]\r\n\r\nAnother species known to occur on the coasts of Ceylon is the _Scorpæna\r\nmiles_, Bennett, or _Pterois miles_, Günther[1], of which Bennett has\r\ngiven a figure[2], but it is not altogether correct in some particulars.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The fish from the Sea of Pinang, described by Dr. CANTOR\r\nwith this name (Catal. Mal. Fish. p. 42), is again different, and\r\nbelongs to a third species.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Fishes of Ceylon_, Pl. ix.]\r\n\r\nIn the fishes of Ceylon, however, beauty is not confined to the\r\nbrilliancy of their tints. In some, as in the _/Scarus harid_, Forsk[1],\r\nthe arrangement of the scales is so graceful, and the effect is so\r\nheightened by modifications of colour, as to present the appearance of\r\ntessellation, or mosaic work.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is the fish figured by BENNETT as _Sparus pepo_.\r\n_Fishes of Ceylon_, Plate xxviii.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCARUS HARID. After Bennett.]\r\n\r\n_Fresh-water Fishes_.--Of the fresh-water fish, which inhabit the rivers\r\nand tanks, so very little has hitherto been known to naturalists[1],\r\nthat of nineteen drawings sent home by Major Skinner in 1852, although\r\nspecimens of well-known genera, Colonel Hamilton Smith pronounced nearly\r\nthe whole to be new and undescribed species.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In extenuation of the little that is known of the\r\nfresh-water fishes of Ceylon, it may be observed that very few of them\r\nare used at table by Europeans, and there is therefore no stimulus on\r\nthe part of the natives to catch them. The burbot and grey mullet are\r\noccasionally eaten, but they taste of mud, and are not in request.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the experiment was made, with success, of introducing\r\ninto Mauritius the _Osphromenus olfax_ of Java, which has also been\r\ntaken to French Guiana. In both places it is now highly esteemed as a\r\nfish for table. As it belongs to a family which possesses the faculty,\r\nhereafter alluded to, of surviving in the damp soil after the subsidence\r\nof the water in the tanks and rivers, it might with equal advantage be\r\nacclimated in Ceylon. It grows to 20 lbs. weight and upwards.]\r\n\r\nOf eight of these, which were from the Mahawelliganga, and caught in the\r\nvicinity of Kandy, five were carps; two were _Leucisci_, and one a\r\n_Mastacembelus_ (_M. armatus_, Lacep); one was an _Ophiocephalus_, and\r\none a _Polyacanthus_, with no serræ on the gills. Six were from the\r\nKalanyganga, close to Colombo, of which two were _Helostoma_, in shape\r\napproaching the Chætodon; two _Ophiocephali_, one a _Silurus_, and one\r\nan _Anabas_, but the gills were without denticulation. From the still\r\nwater of the lake, close to the walls of Colombo, there were two species\r\nof _Eleotris_, one _Silurus_ with barbels, and two _Malacopterygians_,\r\nwhich appear to be _Bagri_.\r\n\r\nThe _fresh-water Perches_ of Europe and of the North of America are\r\nrepresented in Ceylon and India by several genera, which bear to them a\r\ngreat external similarity (_Lates, Therapon_). They have the same habits\r\nas their European allies, and their flesh is considered equally\r\nwholesome, but they appear to enter salt-water, or at least brackish\r\nwater, more freely. It is, however, in their internal organisation that\r\nthey differ most from the perches of Europe; their skeletons are\r\ncomposed of fewer vertebræ, and the air bladder of the _Therapon_ is\r\ndivided into two portions, as in the carps. Four species at least of\r\nthis genus inhabit the lakes and rivers of Ceylon, and one of them, of\r\nwhich a figure is given above, has been but imperfectly described in any\r\nichthyological work[1]; it attains to the length of seven inches.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Holocentrus quadrilineatus, _Bloch_. It is allied to\r\n_Helotes polytoenia_, Bleek., from Halmaheira which it can be readily\r\ndistinguished by having only five or six blackish longitudinal bands,\r\nthe black humeral spot being between the first and second; another\r\nblackish blotch is in the spinous dorsal fin. There are two specimens in\r\nthe British Museum collection, one of which has recently arrived from\r\nAmoy; of the other the locality is unknown. See GÜNTHER, _Acanthopt.\r\nFishes_, vol. i. p. 282, where mention of the black humeral spot has\r\nbeen omitted.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THERAPON QUADRILINEATUS.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to marine eels, in which the Indian coasts abound, Ceylon\r\nhas some true fresh-water eels, which never enter the sea. These are\r\nknown to the natives under the name of _Theliya_, and to naturalists by\r\nthat of _Mastacembelus_. They have sometimes in ichthyological systems\r\nbeen referred to the Scombridæ and other marine families, from the\r\ncircumstance that the dorsal fin anteriorly is composed of spines. But,\r\nin addition to the general shape of the body, their affinity to the eel\r\nis attested, by their confluent fins, by the absence of ventral fins, by\r\nthe structure of the mouth and its dentition, by the apparatus of the\r\ngills, which opens with an inferior slit, and above all by the formation\r\nof the skeleton itself.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See GÜNTHER'S _Acanthopt. Fishes_, vol. iii. (Family\r\nMastacembelidæ).]\r\n\r\nTheir skin is covered with minute scales, coated by a slimy exudation,\r\nand the upper jaw is produced into a soft tripartite tentacle, with\r\nwhich they are enabled to feel for their prey in the mud. They are very\r\ntenacious of life, and belong, without doubt, to those fishes which in\r\nCeylon descend during the drought into the muddy soil.[1] Their flesh\r\nvery much resembles that of the eel; and is highly esteemed.[2] They\r\nwere first made known to European naturalists by Russell[3], who brought\r\nto Europe from the rivers round Aleppo specimens, some of which are\r\nstill preserved in the collection of the British Museum. Aleppo is the\r\nmost western point of their geographical range, the group being mainly\r\nconfined to the East-Indian continent and its islands.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon only one species appears to occur, the\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See post, p. 351.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: CUV. and VAL., _Hist. Poiss._ vol. iii. p. 459.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Nat. Hist. Aleppo_, 2nd edit. Lond. 1794, vol. ii. p. 208,\r\npl. vi.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MASTACEMBELUS ARMATUS]\r\n\r\n_Mastacembelus armatus_.[1] The back is armed with from thirty-five to\r\nthirty-nine short, stout spines; there being three others before the\r\nanal fin. The ground colour of the fish is brown, and the head has two\r\nrather irregular longitudinal black bands; deep-brown spots run along\r\nthe back as well as along the dorsal and anal fins; and the sides are\r\nornamented with irregular and reticulated brown lines. This eel attains\r\nto the length of two feet. The old females do not show any markings,\r\nbeing of a uniform brown colour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Macrognathus armatus, _Lacép._; Mastacembelus armatus,\r\n_Cuv., Val._]\r\n\r\nIn the collection of Major Skinner, before alluded to, brought together\r\nwithout premeditation, the naturalist will be struck by the\r\npreponderance of those genera which are adapted by nature to endure, a\r\ntemporary privation of moisture; and this, taken in connection with the\r\nvicissitudes affecting the waters they inhabit, exhibits a surprising\r\nillustration of the wisdom of the Creator in adapting the organisation\r\nof his creatures to the peculiar circumstances under which they are\r\ndestined to exist.\r\n\r\nSo abundant are fish in all parts of the island, that Knox says, not the\r\nrunning streams alone, but the reservoirs and ponds, \"nay, every ditch\r\nand little plash of water but ankle deep hath fish in it.\"[1] But many\r\nof these reservoirs and tanks are, twice in each year, liable to be\r\nevaporated to dryness till the mud of the bottom is converted into dust,\r\nand the clay cleft by the heat into gaping apertures; yet within a very\r\nfew days after the change of the monsoon, the natives are busily engaged\r\nin fishing in those very spots and in the hollows contiguous to them,\r\nalthough the latter are entirely unconnected with any pool or running\r\nstreams. Here they fish in the same way which Knox described nearly 200\r\nyears ago, with a funnel-shaped basket, open at bottom and top, \"which,\"\r\nas he says, \"they jibb down, and the end sticks in the mud, which often\r\nhappens upon a fish; which, when they feel beating itself against the\r\nsides, they put in their hands and take it out, and reive a ratan\r\nthrough their gills, and so let them drag after them.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Knox's _Historical Relation of Ceylon,_ Part i. ch. vii.\r\nThe occurrence of fish in the most unlooked-for situations, is one of\r\nthe mysteries of other eastern countries as well as Ceylon and India. In\r\nPersia irrigation is carried on to a great extent by means of wells sunk\r\nin line in the direction in which it is desired to lead a supply of\r\nwater, and these are connected by channels, which are carefully arched\r\nover to protect them from evaporation. These _kanats,_ as they are\r\ncalled, are full of fish, although neither they nor the wells they unite\r\nhave any connection with streams or lakes.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Knox, _Historical Relation of Ceylon_, Part i. ch vi.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM KNOX'S CEYLON, A.D. 1681]\r\n\r\nThis operation may be seen in the lowlands, traversed by the high road\r\nleading from Colombo to Kandy. Before the change of the monsoon, the\r\nhollows on either side of the highway are covered with dust or stunted\r\ngrass; but when flooded by the rains, they are immediately resorted to\r\nby the peasants with baskets, constructed precisely as Knox has stated,\r\nin which the fish are entrapped and taken out by the hand.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: As anglers, the native Singhalese exhibit little\r\nexpertness; but for fishing the rivers, they construct with singular\r\ningenuity fences formed of strong stakes, protected by screens of ratan,\r\nthat stretch diagonally across the current; and along these the fish are\r\nconducted into a series of enclosures from which retreat is\r\nimpracticable. MR. LAYARD, in the _Magazine of Natural History_ for May,\r\n1853, has given a diagram of one of these fish \"corrals,\" as they are\r\ncalled, of which a copy is shown on the next page.]\r\n\r\nSo singular a phenomenon as the sudden re-appearance of full-grown\r\nfishes in places that a few days before had been encrusted with hardened\r\nclay, has not failed to attract attention; but the European residents\r\nhave been content to explain it by hazarding conjectures, either that\r\nthe spawn must have lain imbedded in the dried earth till released by\r\nthe rains, or that the fish, so unexpectedly discovered, fall from the\r\nclouds during the deluge of the monsoon.\r\n\r\nAs to the latter conjecture; the fall of fish during showers, even were\r\nit not so problematical in theory, is too rare an event to account for\r\nthe punctual appearance of those found in the rice-fields, at stated\r\nperiods of the year. Both at Galle and Colombo in the south-west\r\nmonsoon, fish are popularly believed to have fallen from the clouds\r\nduring violent showers, but those found on the occasions that give rise\r\nto this belief, consist of the smallest fry, such as could be caught up\r\nby waterspouts, and vortices analogous to them, or otherwise blown on\r\nshore from the surf; whereas those which suddenly appear in the\r\nreplenished tanks and in the hollows which they overflow, are mature and\r\nwell-grown fish.[1] Besides, the latter are found, under the\r\ncircumstances I have described, in all parts of the interior, whilst the\r\nprodigy of a supposed fall of fish from the sky has been noticed, I\r\napprehend, only in the vicinity of the sea, or of some inland water.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: I had an opportunity, on one occasion only, of witnessing\r\nthe phenomenon which gives rise to this popular belief. I was driving in\r\nthe cinnamon gardens near the fort of Colombo, and saw a violent but\r\npartial shower descend at no great distance before me. On coming to the\r\nspot I found a multitude of small silvery fish from one and a half to\r\ntwo inches in length, leaping on the gravel of the high road, numbers of\r\nwhich I collected and brought away in my palankin. The spot was about\r\nhalf a mile from the sea, and entirely unconnected with any watercourse\r\nor pool.\r\n\r\nMr. Whiting, who was many years resident in Trincomadie, writes me that\r\nhe \"had often been told by the natives on that side of the island that\r\nit sometimes rained fishes; and on one occasion\" (he adds) \"I was taken\r\nby them, in 1849, to a field at the village of Karrancotta-tivo, near\r\nBatticaloa, which was dry when I passed over it in the morning, but, had\r\nbeen covered in two hours by sudden rain to the depth of three inches,\r\nin which there was then a quantity of small fish. The water had no\r\nconnection with any pond or stream whatsoever.\" Mr. Cripps, in like\r\nmanner, in speaking of Galle, says: \"I have seen in the vicinity of the\r\nfort, fish taken from rain-water that had accumulated in the hollow\r\nparts of land that in the hot season are perfectly dry and parched. The\r\nplace is accessible to no running stream or tank; and either the fish or\r\nthe spawn from which they were produced, must of necessity have fallen\r\nwith the rain.\"\r\n\r\nMr. J. PRINSEP, the eminent secretary to the Asiatic Society of Bengal,\r\nfound a fish in the pulviometer at Calcutta, in 1838.--_Journ. Asiat.\r\nSoc. Bengal_, vol. vi. p. 465.\r\n\r\nA series of instances in which fishes have been found on the continent\r\nof India under circumstances which lead to the conclusion that they must\r\nhave fallen from the clouds, have been collected by the late Dr. BUIST\r\nof Bombay, and will be found in the appendix to this chapter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISH CORRAL]\r\n\r\nThe surmise of the buried spawn is one sanctioned by the very highest\r\nauthority. Mr. Yarrell in his \"_History of British Fishes_,\" adverting\r\nto the fact that ponds (in India) which had been previously converted\r\ninto hardened mud, are replenished with small fish in a very few days\r\nafter the commencement of each rainy season, offers this solution of the\r\nproblem as probably the true one: \"The impregnated ova of the fish of\r\none rainy season are left unhatched in the mud through the dry season,\r\nand from their low state of organisation as ova, the vitality is\r\npreserved till the recurrence, and contact of the rain and oxygen in the\r\nnext wet season, when vivification takes place from their joint\r\ninfluence.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: YARRELL, _History of British Fishes_, introd. vol. i. p.\r\nxxvi. This too was the opinion of Aristotle, _De Respiratione_, c. ix.]\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis, however, appears to have been advanced upon imperfect\r\ndata; for although some fish, like the salmon, scrape grooves in the\r\nsand and place their spawn in inequalities and fissures; yet as a\r\ngeneral rule spawn is deposited not beneath but on the surface of the\r\nground or sand over which the water flows, the adhesive nature of each\r\negg supplying the means of attachment. But in the Ceylon tanks not only\r\nis the surface of the soil dried to dust after the evaporation of the\r\nwater, but earth itself, twelve or eighteen inches deep, is converted\r\ninto sun-burnt clay, in which, although the eggs of mollusca, in their\r\ncalcareous covering, are in some instances preserved, it would appear to\r\nbe as impossible for the ova of fish to be kept from decomposition as\r\nfor the fish themselves to sustain life. Besides, moisture in such\r\nsituations is only to be found at a depth to which spawn could not be\r\nconveyed by the parent fish, by any means with which we are yet\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nBut supposing it possible to carry the spawn sufficiently deep, and to\r\ndeposit it safely in the mud below, which is still damp, whence it could\r\nbe liberated on the return of the rains, a considerable interval would\r\nstill be necessary after the replenishing of the ponds with water to\r\nadmit of vivification and growth. Yet so far from this interval being\r\nallowed to elapse, the rains have no sooner fallen than the taking of\r\nthe fish commences, and those captured by the natives in wicker cages\r\nare mature and full grown instead of being \"small fish\" or fry, as\r\nsupposed by Mr. Yarrell.\r\n\r\nEven admitting the soundness of his theory, and the probability that,\r\nunder favourable circumstances, the spawn in the tanks might be\r\npreserved during the dry season so as to contribute to the perpetuation\r\nof their breed, the fact is no longer doubtful, that adult fish in\r\nCeylon, like some of those that inhabit similar waters both in the New\r\nand Old World, have been endowed by the Creator with the singular\r\nfaculty of providing against the periodical droughts either by\r\njourneying overland in search of still unexhausted water, or, on its\r\nutter disappearance, by burying themselves in the mud to await the\r\nreturn of the rains.\r\n\r\nIt is an illustration of the eagerness with which, after the expedition\r\nof Alexander the Great, particulars connected with the natural history\r\nof India were sought for and arranged by the Greeks, that in the works\r\nboth of ARISTOTLE and THEOPHRASTUS facts are recorded of the fishes in\r\nthe Indian rivers migrating in search of water, of their burying\r\nthemselves in the mud on its failure, of their being dug out thence\r\nalive during the dry season, and of their spontaneous reappearance on\r\nthe return of the rains. The earliest notice is in ARISTOTLE'S treatise\r\n_De Respiratione_[1], where he mentions the strange discovery of living\r\nfish found beneath the surface of the soil, \"[Greek: tôn ichthyôn oi\r\npolloi zôsin en tê gê, akinêtizontes mentoi, kai euriskontai\r\noryttomenoi?]\" and in his History of Animals he conjectures that in\r\nponds periodically dried the ova of the fish so buried become vivified\r\nat the change of the season.[2] HERODOTUS had previously hazarded a\r\nsimilar theory to account for the sudden appearance of fry in the\r\nEgyptian marshes on the rising of the Nile; but the cases are not\r\nparallel. THEOPHRASTUS, the friend and pupil of Aristotle, gave\r\nimportance to the subject by devoting to it his essay [Greek: Peri tês\r\ntôn ichthyôn en zêrô diamonês], _De Piscibus in sicco degentibus_. In\r\nthis, after adverting to the fish called _exocoetus_, from its habit of\r\ngoing on shore to sleep, \"[Greek: apo tês koitês,]\" he instances the\r\nsmall fish ([Greek: ichthydia]), that leave the rivers of India to\r\nwander like frogs on the land; and likewise a species found near\r\nBabylon, which, when the Euphrates runs low, leave the dry channels in\r\nsearch of food, \"moving themselves along by means of their fins and\r\ntail.\" He proceeds to state that at Heraclea Pontica there are places in\r\nwhich fish are dug out of the earth, \"[Greek: oryktoi tôn ichthyôn],\"\r\nand he accounts for their being found under such circumstances by the\r\nsubsidence of the rivers, \"when the water being evaporated the fish\r\ngradually descend beneath the soil in search of moisture; and the\r\nsurface becoming hard they are preserved in the damp clay below it, in a\r\nstate of torpor, but are capable of vigorous movements when disturbed.\"\r\n\"In, this manner, too,\" adds Theophrastus, \"the buried fish propagate,\r\nleaving behind them their spawn, which becomes vivified on the return of\r\nthe waters to their accustomed bed.\" This work of Theophrastus became\r\nthe great authority for all subsequent writers on this question.\r\nATHENÆUS quotes it[3], and adds the further testimony of POLYBIUS, that\r\nin Gallia Narbonensis fish are similarly dug out of the ground.[4]\r\nSTRABO repeats the story[5], and the Greek naturalists one and all\r\nreceived the statement as founded on reliable authority.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Chap. ix.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Lib. vi. ch. 15, 16, 17.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Lib. viii. ch. 2.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Ib._ ch. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Lib. iv. and xii.]\r\n\r\nNot so the Romans. LIVY mentions it as one of the prodigies which were\r\nto be \"expiated\" on the approach of a rupture with Macedon, that \"in\r\nGallico agro qua induceretur aratrum sub glebis pisces emersisse,\"[1]\r\nthus taking it out of the category of natural occurrences. POMPONIUS\r\nMELA, obliged to notice the matter in his account of Narbon Gaul,\r\naccompanies it with the intimation that although asserted by both Greek\r\nand Roman authorities, the story was either a delusion or a fraud,\r\nJUVENAL has a sneer for the rustic--\r\n\r\n          \"miranti sub aratro\r\n   Piscibus inventis.\"--_Sat_. xiii. 63.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Lib. xlii. ch. 2.]\r\n\r\nAnd SENECA, whilst he quotes Theophrastus, adds ironically, that now we\r\nmust go to fish with a _hatchet_ instead of a hook; \"non cum hamis, sed\r\ncum dolabra ire piscatum.\" PLINY, who devotes the 35th chapter of his\r\n9th book to this subject, uses the narrative of Theophrastus, but with\r\nobvious caution, and universally the Latin writers treated the story as\r\na fable.\r\n\r\nIn later times the subject received more enlightened attention, and\r\nBeekman, who in 1736 published his commentary on the collection [Greek:\r\nPeri Thaumasiôn akousmatôn], ascribed to Aristotle, has given a list of\r\nthe authorities about his own times,--GEORGIUS AGRICOLA, GESNER,\r\nRONDELET, DALECHAMP, BOMARE, and GRONOVIUS, who not only gave credence\r\nto the assertions of Theophrastus, but adduced modern instances in\r\ncorroboration of his Indian authorities.\r\n\r\nAs regards the fresh-water fishes of India and Ceylon, the fact is now\r\nestablished that certain of them possess the power of leaving the rivers\r\nand returning to them again after long migrations on dry land, and\r\nmodern observation has fully confirmed their statements. They leave the\r\npools and nullahs in the dry season, and led by an instinct as yet\r\nunexplained, shape their course through the grass towards the nearest\r\npool of water. A similar phenomenon is observable in countries similarly\r\ncircumstanced. The Doras of Guiana[1] have been seen travelling over\r\nland during the dry season in search of their natural element[2], in\r\nsuch droves that the negroes fill baskets with them during these\r\nterrestrial excursions. PALLEGOIX in his account of Siam, enumerates\r\nthree species of fishes which leave the tanks and channels and traverse\r\nthe damp grass[3]; and SIR JOHN BOWRING, in his account of his embassy\r\nto the Siamese kings in 1855, states, that in ascending and descending\r\nthe river Meinam to Bankok, he was amused with the novel sight of fish\r\nleaving the river, gliding over the wet banks, and losing themselves\r\namongst the trees of the jungle.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _D. Hancockii_, CUV. et VAL.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Sir R. Schomburgk's _Fishes of Guiana_, vol. i. pp. 113,\r\n151, 160. Another migratory fish was found by Bose very numerous in the\r\nfresh waters of Carolina and in ponds liable to become dry in summer.\r\nWhen captured and placed on the ground, \"they _always, directed\r\nthemselves towards the nearest water, which they could not possibly\r\nsee_, and which they must have discovered by some internal index. They\r\nbelong to the genus _Hydrargyra_ and are called Swampines.--KIRBY,\r\n_Bridgewater Treatise_, vol. i. p. 143.\r\n\r\nEels kept in a garden, when August arrived (the period at which instinct\r\nimpels them to go to the sea to spawn) were in the habit of leaving the\r\npond, and were invariably found moving eastward _in the direction of the\r\nsea_.--YARRELL, vol. ii. p. 384. Anglers observe that fish newly caught,\r\nwhen placed out of sight of water, always struggle towards it to\r\nescape.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: PALLEGOIX, vol. i. p. 144.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Sir J. BOWERING'S _Siam,_ &c., vol. i. p. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe class of fishes endowed with this power are chiefly those with\r\nlabyrinthiform pharyngeal bones, so disposed in plates and cells as to\r\nretain a supply of moisture, which, whilst they are crawling on land,\r\ngradually exudes so as to keep the gills damp.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: CUVIER and VALENCIENNES, _Hist. Nat. des Poissons_, tom.\r\nvii. p. 246.]\r\n\r\nThe individual most frequently seen in these excursions in Ceylon is a\r\nperch called by the Singhalese _Kavaya_ or _Kawhy-ya_, and by the Tamils\r\n_Pannei-eri_, or _Sennal_. It is closely allied to the _Anabas scandens_\r\nof Cuvier, the _Perca scandens_ of Daldorf. It grows to about six inches\r\nin length, the head round and covered with scales, and the edges of the\r\ngill-covers strongly denticulated. Aided by the apparatus already\r\nadverted to in its head, this little creature issues boldly from its\r\nnative pools and addresses itself to its toilsome march generally at\r\nnight or in the early morning, whilst the grass is still damp with the\r\ndew; but in its distress it is sometimes compelled to move by day, and\r\nMr. E.L. Layard on one occasion encountered a number of them travelling\r\nalong a hot and dusty road under the midday sun.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Annals and Mag. of Nat. Hist_., May, 1853, p. 390. Mr.\r\nMorris, the government-agent of Trincomalie, writing to me on this\r\nsubject in 1856, says--\"I was lately on duty inspecting the kind of a\r\nlarge tank at Nade-cadua, which, being out of repair, the remaining\r\nwater was confined in a small hollow in the otherwise dry bed. Whilst\r\nthere heavy rain came on, and, as we stood on the high ground, we,\r\nobserved a pelican on the margin of the shallow pool gorging himself;\r\nour people went towards him and raised a cry of fish! fish! We hurried\r\ndown, and found numbers of fish struggling upwards through the grass in\r\nthe rills formed by the trickling of the rain. There was scarcely water\r\nenough to cover them, but nevertheless they made rapid progress up the\r\nbank, on which our followers collected about two bushels of them at a\r\ndistance of forty yards from the tank. They were forcing their way up\r\nthe knoll, and, had they not been intercepted first by the pelican and\r\nafterwards by ourselves, they would in a few minutes have gained the\r\nhighest point and descended on the other side into a pool which formed\r\nanother portion of the tank. They were chub, the same as are found in\r\nthe mud after the tanks dry up.\" In a subsequent communication in July,\r\n1857, the same gentleman says--\"As the tanks dry up the fish congregate\r\nin the little pools till at last you find them in thousands in the\r\nmoistest parts of the beds, rolling in the blue mud which is at that\r\ntime about the consistence of thick gruel.\"\r\n\r\n\"As the moisture further evaporates the surface fish are left uncovered,\r\nand they crawl away in search of fresh pools. In one place I saw\r\nhundreds diverging in every direction, from the tank they had just\r\nabandoned to a distance of fifty or sixty yards, and still travelling\r\nonwards. In going this distance, however, they must have used muscular\r\nexertion sufficient to have taken them half a mile on level ground, for\r\nat these places all the cattle and wild animals of the neighbourhood had\r\nlatterly come to drink; so that the surface was everywhere indented with\r\nfootmarks in addition to the cracks in the surrounding baked mud, into\r\nwhich the fish tumbled in their progress. In those holes which were deep\r\nand the sides perpendicular they remained to die, and were carried off\r\nby kites and crows.\"\r\n\r\n\"My impression is that this migration takes place at night or before\r\nsunrise, for it was only early in the morning that I have seen them\r\nprogressing, and I found that those I brought away with me in chatties\r\nappeared quiet by day, but a large proportion managed to get out of the\r\nchatties at night--some escaped altogether, others were trodden on and\r\nkilled.\"\r\n\r\n\"One peculiarity is the large size of the vertebral column, quite\r\ndisproportioned to the bulk of the fish. I particularly noticed that all\r\nin the act of migrating had their gills expanded.\"]\r\n\r\nReferring to the _Anabas scandens_, DR. HAMILTON BUCHANAN says, that of\r\nall the fish with which he was acquainted it is the most teliacious of\r\nlife; and he has known boatmen on the Ganges to keep them for five or\r\nsix days in an earthen pot without water, and daily to use what they\r\nwanted, finding them as lively and fresh as when caught.[1] Two Danish\r\nnaturalists residing at Tranquebar, have contributed their authority to\r\nthe fact of this fish ascending trees on the coast of Coromandel, an\r\nexploit from which it acquired its epithet of _Perca scandens_. DALDORF,\r\nwho was a lieutenant in the Danish East India Company's service,\r\ncommunicated to Sir Joseph Banks, that in the year 1791 he had taken\r\nthis fish from a moist cavity in the stem of a Palmyra palm, that grew\r\nnear a lake. He saw it when already five feet above the ground\r\nstruggling to ascend still higher;--\"suspending itself by its\r\ngill-covers, and bending its tail to the left, it fixed its anal fin in\r\nthe cavity of the bark, and sought by expanding its body to urge its way\r\nupwards, and its march was only arrested by the hand with which he\r\nseized it.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Fishes of the Ganges_, 4to. 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Transactions Linn. Soc._ vol. iii. p. 63. It is\r\nremarkable, however, that this discovery of Daldorf, which excited so\r\ngreat an interest in 1791, had been anticipated by an Arabian voyager a\r\nthousand years before. Abou-zeyd, the compiler of the remarkable MS.\r\nknown since Renaudot's translation by the title of the _Travels of the\r\nTwo Mahometans_, states that Suleyman, one of his informants, who\r\nvisited India at the close of the ninth century, was told there of a\r\nfish which, issuing from the waters, ascended the coco-nut palms to\r\ndrink their sap, and returned to the sea. \"On parle d'un poisson de mer\r\nqui, sortant de l'eau, monte sur la cocotier et boit le suc de la\r\nplante; ensuite il retourne á la mer.\" See REINAUD, _Rélations des\r\nVoyages faits par les Arabes et Persans dans le neuvième siècle_, tom.\r\ni. p, 21, tom. ii. p. 93.]\r\n\r\nThere is considerable obscurity about the story of this ascent, although\r\ncorroborated by M. JOHN. Its motive for climbing is not apparent, since\r\nwater being close at hand it could not have gone for sake of the\r\nmoisture contained in the fissures of the palm; nor could it be in\r\nsearch of food, as it lives not on fruit but on aquatic insects.[1] The\r\ndescent, too, is a question of difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Kirby says that it is \"in pursuit of certain crustaceans\r\nthat form its food\" (_Bridgewater Treatise_, vol i. p. 144); but I am\r\nnot aware of any crustaceans in the island which ascend the palmyra or\r\nfeed upon its fruit. The _Birgus latro_, which inhabits Mauritius, and\r\nis said to climb the coco-nut for this purpose, has not been observed in\r\nCeylon.]\r\n\r\nThe position of its fins, and the spines on its gill-covers, might\r\nassist its journey upwards, but the same apparatus would prove anything\r\nbut a facility in steadying its journey down. The probability is, as\r\nsuggested by Buchanan, that the ascent which was witnessed by Daldorf\r\nwas accidental, and ought not to be regarded as the habit of the animal.\r\nIn Ceylon I heard of no instance of the perch ascending trees[1], but\r\nthe fact is well established that both it, the _pullata_ (a species of\r\n_polyacanthus_), and others, are capable of long journeys on the level\r\nground.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This assertion must be qualified by a fact stated by Mr.\r\nE.A. Layard, who mentions that on visiting one of the fishing stations\r\non a Singhalese river, where the fish are caught in staked enclosures,\r\nas described at p. 342, and observing that the chambers were covered\r\nwith netting, he asked the reason, and was told \"_that some of the fish\r\nclimbed up the sticks and got over._\"--Mag. Nat. Hist, for May 1823, p.\r\n390-1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Strange accidents have more than once occurred at Ceylon\r\narising from the habit of the native anglers; who, having neither\r\nbaskets nor pockets in which to place what they catch, will seize a fish\r\nin their teeth whilst putting fresh bait on their hook. In August, 1853,\r\na man was carried into the Pettah hospital at Colombo, having a climbing\r\nperch, which he thus attempted to hold, firmly imbedded in his throat.\r\nThe spines of its dorsal fin prevented its descent, whilst those of the\r\ngill-covers equally forbade its return. It was eventually extracted by\r\nthe forceps through an incision in the oesophagus, and the patient\r\nrecovered. Other similar cases have proved fatal.]\r\n\r\n_Burying Fishes._--But a still more remarkable power possessed by some\r\nof the Ceylon fishes, is that already alluded to, of secreting\r\nthemselves in the earth in the dry season, at the bottom of the\r\nexhausted ponds, and there awaiting the renewal of the water at the\r\nchange of the monsoon. The instinct of the crocodile to resort to the\r\nsame expedient has been already referred to[1], and in like manner the\r\nfish, when distressed by the evaporation of the tanks, seek relief by\r\nimmersing first their heads, and by degrees their whole bodies, in the\r\nmud; sinking to a depth at which they find sufficient moisture to\r\npreserve life in a state of lethargy long after the bed of the tank has\r\nbeen consolidated by the intense heat of the sun. It is possible, too,\r\nthat the cracks which reticulate the surface may admit air to some\r\nextent to sustain their faint respiration.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _ante_, p. 285.]\r\n\r\nThe same thing takes place in other tropical regions, subject to\r\nvicissitudes of drought and moisture. The Protopterus[1], which inhabits\r\nthe Gambia (and which though demonstrated by Professor Owen to possess\r\nall the essential organisation of fishes, is nevertheless provided with\r\ntrue lungs), is accustomed in the dry season, when the river retires\r\ninto its channel, to bury itself to the depth of twelve or sixteen\r\ninches in the indurated mud of the banks, and to remain in a state of\r\ntorpor till the rising of the stream after the rains enables it to\r\nresume its active habits. At this period the natives of the Gambia, like\r\nthose of Ceylon, resort to the river, and secure the fish in\r\nconsiderable numbers as they flounder in the still shallow water. A\r\nparallel instance occurs, in Abyssinia in relation to the fish of the\r\nMareb, one of the sources of the Nile, the waters of which are partially\r\nabsorbed in traversing the plains of Taka. During the summer its bed is\r\ndry, and in the slime at the depth of more than six feet is found a\r\nspecies of fish without scales, different from any known to inhabit the\r\nNile.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Lepidosiren annectans_, Owen. See _Linn. Trans._ 1839.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This statement will be found in QUATREMERE'S Mémoires sur\r\nl'Egypte, tom. i. p. 17, on the authority of Abdullah ben Ahmed ben\r\nSolaim Assouany, in his _History of Nubia_, \"Simon, héritier présomptif\r\ndu royanme d'Alouah, m'a assuré que l'on trouve, dans la vase qui couvre\r\nfond de cette rivière, un grand poisson sans écailles, qui ne ressemble\r\nen rien aux poissons du Nil, et que, pour l'avoir, il faut creuser à une\r\ntoise et plus de profondeur.\" To this passage, there is appended this\r\nnote:--\"Le patriarche Mendes, cité par Legrand (_Relation Hist. d'\r\nAbyssinie_, du P. LOBO, p. 212-3) rapporte que le fleuve Mareb, après\r\navoir arrosé une étendue de pays considérable, se perd sous terre; et\r\nque quand les Portugais faisaient la guerre dans ce pays, ils\r\nfouilloient dans le sable, et y trouvoient de la bonne eau et du ban\r\npoisson. An rapport de l'auteur de _l' Ayin Akbery_ (tom. ii, p. 146,\r\ned. 1800), dans le Soubah do Caschmir, pres du lieu nommé Tilahmoulah,\r\nest une grande pièce de terre qui est inondée pendant la saison des\r\npluies. Lorsque les eaux se sont évaporées, et que la vase est presque\r\nséche, les habitans prennant des bâtons d'environ une aune do long,\r\nqu'ils enfoncent dans la vase, et ils y trouvent quantité de grands et\r\npetits poissons.\" In the library of the British Museum there is an\r\nunique MS. of MANOEL DE ALMEIDA, written in the sixteenth century, from\r\nwhich Balthasar Tellec compiled his _Historia General de Ethiopia alta_,\r\nprinted at Coimbra in 1660, and in it the above statement of Mendes is\r\ncorroborated by Almeida, who says that he was told by João Gabriel, a\r\nCreole Portuguese, born in Abyssinia, who had visited the Mareb, and who\r\nsaid that the \"fish were to be found everywhere eight or ten palms down,\r\nand that he had eaten of them.\"]\r\n\r\nIn South America the \"round-headed hassar\" of Guiana, _Callicthys\r\nlittoralis_, and the \"yarrow,\" a species of the family Esocidæ, although\r\nthey possess no specially modified respiratory organs, are accustomed to\r\nbury themselves in the mud on the subsidence of water in the pools\r\nduring the dry season.[1] The _Loricaria_ of Surinam, another Siluridan,\r\nexhibits a similar instinct, and resorts to the same expedient. Sir R.\r\nSchomburgk, in his account of the fishes of Guiana, confirms this\r\naccount of the Callicthys, and says \"they can exist in muddy lakes\r\nwithout any water whatever, and great numbers of them are sometimes dug\r\nup from such situations.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Paper \"_on some Species of Fishes and Reptiles in\r\nDemerara_,\" by J. HANDCOCK, Esq., M.D., _Zoological Journal_, vol. iv.\r\np. 243.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: A curious account of the _borachung_ or \"ground fish\" of\r\nBhootan, will be found in Note (C.) appended to this chapter.]\r\n\r\nIn those portions of Ceylon where the country is flat, and small tanks\r\nare extremely numerous, the natives are accustomed in the hot season to\r\ndig in the mud for fish. Mr. Whiting, the chief civil officer of the\r\neastern province, informs me that, on two occasions, he was present\r\naccidentally when the villagers were so engaged, once at the tank of\r\nMalliativoe, within a few miles of Kottiar, near the bay of Trincomalie,\r\nand again at a tank between Ellendetorre and Arnitivoe, on the bank of\r\nthe Vergel river. The clay was firm, but moist, and as the men flung out\r\nlumps of it with a spade, it fell to pieces, disclosing fish from nine\r\nto twelve inches long, which were full grown and healthy, and jumped on\r\nthe bank when exposed to the sun light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANABAS OF THE DRY TANKS.]\r\n\r\nBeing desirous of obtaining a specimen of fish so exhumed, I received\r\nfrom the Moodliar of Matura, A.B. Wickremeratne, a fish taken along with\r\nothers of the same kind from a tank in which the water had dried up; it\r\nwas found at a depth of a foot and a half where the mud was still moist,\r\nwhilst the surface was dry and hard. The fish which the moodliar sent to\r\nme is an Anabas, closely resembling the _Perca scandens_ of Daldorf; but\r\non minute examination it proves to be a species unknown in India, and\r\nhitherto found only in Boreno and China. It is the _A. oligolepis_ of\r\nBleek.\r\n\r\nBut the faculty of becoming torpid at such periods is not confined in\r\nCeylon to the crocodile sand fishes;--it is also possessed by some of\r\nthe fresh-water mollusca and aquatic coleoptera. One of the former, the\r\n_Ampullaria glauca_, is found in still water in all parts of the island,\r\nnot alone in the tanks, but in rice-fields and the watercourses by which\r\nthey are irrigated. When, during the dry season, the water is about to\r\nevaporate, it burrows and conceals itself[1] till the returning rains\r\nrestore it to activity, and reproduce its accustomed food. There, at a\r\nconsiderable depth in the soft mud, it deposits a bundle of eggs with a\r\nwhite calcareous shell, to the number of one hundred or more in each\r\ngroup. The _Melania Paludina_ in the same way retires during the\r\ndroughts into the muddy soil of the rice lands; and it can only be by\r\nsuch an instinct that this and other mollusca are preserved when the\r\ntanks evaporate, to re-appear in full growth and vigour immediately on\r\nthe return of the rains.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A knowledge of this fact was turned to prompt account by\r\nMr. Edgar S. Layard, when holding a judicial office at Point Pedro in\r\n1849. A native who had been defrauded of his land complained before him\r\nof his neighbour, who, during his absence, had removed their common\r\nlandmark, diverting the original watercourse and obliterating its traces\r\nby filling it up to a level with the rest of the field. Mr. Layard\r\ndirected a trench to be sunk at the contested spot, and discovering\r\nnumbers of the Ampullaria, the remains of the eggs, and the living\r\nanimal which had been buried for months, the evidence was so resistless\r\nas to confound the wrong-doer, and terminate the suit.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For a similar fact relative to the shells and water beetles\r\nin the pools near Rio Janeiro, see DARWIN'S _Nat. Journal_, ch. v. p.\r\n99. BENSON, in the first vol. of _Gleanings of Science_, published at\r\nCalcutta in 1829, describes a species of _Paludina_ found in pools,\r\nwhich are periodically dried up in the hot season but reappear with the\r\nrains, p. 363. And in the _Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal_ for\r\nSept. 1832, Lieut. HUTTON, in a singularly interesting paper, has\r\nfollowed up the same subject by a narrative of his own observations at\r\nMirzapore, wherein June, 1832, after a few heavy showers of rain, that\r\nformed pools on the surface of the ground near a mango grove, he saw the\r\n_Paludinæ_ issuing from the ground, \"pushing aside the moistened earth\r\nand coming forth from their retreats; but on the disappearance of the\r\nwater not one of them was to be seen above ground. Wishing to ascertain\r\nwhat had become of them he turned up the earth at the base of several\r\ntrees, and invariably found the shells buried from an inch to two inches\r\nbelow the surface.\" Lieut. Hutton adds that the _Ampullariæ_ and\r\n_Planorbes_, as well as the _Paludinæ_ are found in similar situations\r\nduring the heats of the dry season. The British _Pisidea_ exibit the\r\nsame faculty (see a monograph in the _Camb. Phil. Trans._ vol. iv.). The\r\nfact is elsewhere alluded to in the present work of the power possessed\r\nby the land leech of Ceylon of retaining vitality even after being\r\nparched to hardness during the heat of the rainless season. LYELL\r\nmentions the instance of some snails in Italy which, when they\r\nhybernate, descend to the depth of five feet and more below the surface.\r\n_Princip. of Geology,_ &c, p. 373.]\r\n\r\nDr. John Hunter[1] has advanced an opinion that hybernation, although a\r\nresult of cold, is not its immediate consequence, but is attributable to\r\nthat deprivation of food and other essentials which extreme cold\r\noccasions, and against the recurrence of which nature makes a timely\r\nprovision by a suspension of her functions. Excessive heat in the\r\ntropics produces an effect upon animals and vegetables analogous to that\r\nof excessive cold in northern regions, and hence it is reasonable to\r\nsuppose that the torpor induced by the one may be but the counterpart of\r\nthe hybernation which results from the other. The frost that imprisons\r\nthe alligator in the Mississippi as effectually cuts it off from food\r\nand action as the drought which incarcerates the crocodile in the\r\nsun-burnt clay of a Ceylon tank. The hedgehog of Europe enters on a\r\nperiod of absolute torpidity as soon as the inclemency of winter\r\ndeprives it of its ordinary supply of slugs and insects; and the\r\n_tenrec_[2] of Madagascar, its tropical representative, exhibits the\r\nsame tendency during the period when excessive heat produces in that\r\nclimate a like result.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HUNTER'S _Observations on parts of the Animal oeconomy_, p.\r\n88.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Centetes ecaudatus_, Illiger.]\r\n\r\nThe descent of the _Ampullaria_, and other fresh-water molluscs, into\r\nthe mud of the tanks, has its parallel in the conduct of the _Bulimi_\r\nand _Helices_ on land. The European snail, in the beginning of winter,\r\neither buries itself in the earth or withdraws to some crevice or\r\noverarching stone to await the returning vegetation of spring. So, in\r\nthe season of intense heat, the _Helix Waltoni_ of Ceylon, and others of\r\nthe same family, before retiring under cover, close the aperture of\r\ntheir shells with an impervious epiphragm, which effectually protects\r\ntheir moisture and juices from evaporation during the period of their\r\næstivation. The Bulimi of Chili have been found alive in England in a\r\nbox packed in cotton after an interval of two years, and the animal\r\ninhabiting a land-shell from Suez, which was attached to a tablet and\r\ndeposited in the British Museum in 1846, was found in 1850 to have\r\nformed a fresh epiphragm, and on being immersed in tepid water, it\r\nemerged from its shell. It became torpid again on the 15th November,\r\n1851, and was found dead and dried up in March, 1852.[1] But exceptions\r\nserve to prove the accuracy of Hunter's opinion almost as strikingly as\r\naccordances, since the same genera of animals that hybernate in Europe,\r\nwhere extreme cold disarranges their oeconomy, evince no symptoms of\r\nlethargy in the tropics, provided their food be not diminished by the\r\nheat. Ants, which are torpid in Europe during winter, work all the year\r\nround in India, where sustenance is uniform.[2] The shrews of Ceylon\r\n(_Sorex montanus_ and _S. ferrugineus_ of Kelaart), like those at home,\r\nsubsist upon insects, but as they inhabit a region where the equable\r\ntemperature admits of the pursuit of their prey at all seasons of the\r\nyear, unlike those of Europe, they never hybernate. A similar\r\nobservation applies to bats, which are dormant during a northern winter\r\nwhen insects are rare, but never become torpid in any part of the\r\ntropics. The bear, in like manner, is nowhere deprived of its activity\r\nexcept when the rigour of severe frost cuts off its access to its\r\naccustomed food. On the other hand, the tortoise, which in Venezuela\r\nimmerses itself in indurated mud during the hot months shows no tendency\r\nto torpor in Ceylon, where its food is permanent; and yet it is subject\r\nto hybernation when carried to the colder regions of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Annals of Natural History_, 1860. See Dr. BAIRD'S _Account\r\nof Helix desertorum; Excelsior,_ &c., ch. i. p. 345.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Colonel SKYES has described in the _Entomological Trans._\r\nthe operations of an ant in India which lays up a store of hay against\r\nthe rainy season.]\r\n\r\nTo the fish in the detached tanks and pools when the heat, by exhausting\r\nthe water, deprives them at once of motion and sustenance, the practical\r\neffect must be the same as when the frost of a northern winter encases\r\nthem in ice. Nor is it difficult to believe that they can successfully\r\nundergo the one crisis when we know beyond question that they may\r\nsurvive the other.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: YARRELL, vol. i. p. 364, quotes the authority of Dr. J.\r\nHunter in his _Animal oeconomy_, that fish, \"after being frozen still\r\nretain so much of life as when thawed to resume their vital actions;\"\r\nand in-the same volume (_Introd_. vol. i. p. xvii.) he relates from\r\nJESSE'S _Gleanings in Natural History_, the story of a gold fish\r\n(_Cyprinus auratus_), which, together with the a marble basin, was\r\nfrozen into one solid lump of ice, yet, on the water being thawed, the\r\nfish became as lively as usual. Dr. RICHARDSON in the third vol of his\r\n_Fauna Borealis Americana_, says the grey sucking carp, found in the fur\r\ncountries of North America, may be frozen and thawed again without being\r\nkilled in the process.]\r\n\r\n_Hot-water Fishes_.--Another incident is striking in connection with the\r\nfresh-water fishes of Ceylon. I have described elsewhere the hot springs\r\nof Kannea[1], in the vicinity of Trincomalie, the water in which flows\r\nat a temperature varying at different seasons from 85° to 115°. In the\r\nstream formed by these wells M. Reynaud found and forwarded to Cuvier\r\ntwo fishes which he took from the water at a time when his thermometer\r\nindicated a temperature of 37° Reaumur, equal to 115° of Fahrenheit. The\r\none was an Apogon, the other an Ambassis, and to each, from the heat of\r\nits habitat, he assigned the specific name of \"thermalis.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See SIR J. EMERSON TENNET's _Ceylon_, &c., vol. ii. p.\r\n496.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: CUV. and VAL., vol. iii. p. 363. In addition to the two\r\nfishes above named, a loche _Cobitis thermalis_, and a carp, _Nuria\r\nthermoicos_, were found in the hot-springs of Kannea, at a heat 40°\r\nCent., 114° Fahr., and a roach, _Leuciscus thermalis_, when the\r\nthermometer indicated 50° Cent, 122° Fahr.--_Ib_. xviii. p. 59, xvi. p.\r\n182, xvii. p. 94. Fish have been taken from a hot spring at Pooree when\r\nthe thermometer stood at 112° Fahr., and as they belonged to a\r\ncarnivorous genus, they must have found prey living in the same high\r\ntemperature.--_Journ.

In July, 1826, live fish were seen to\r\nfall on the grass at Moradabad during a storm. They were the common\r\ncyprinus, so prevalent in our Indian waters. On the 19th of February,\r\n1830, at noon, a heavy fall of fish occurred at the Nokulhatty factory,\r\nin the Daccah zillah; depositions on the subject were obtained from nine\r\ndifferent parties. The fish were all dead; most of them were large; some\r\nwere fresh, others were rotten and mutilated. They were seen at first in\r\nthe sky, like a flock of birds, descending rapidly to the ground; there\r\nwas rain drizzling, but no storm. On the 16th and 17th of May, 1833, a\r\nfall of fish occurred in the zillah of Futtehpoor, about three miles\r\nnorth of the Jumna, after a violent storm of wind and rain. The fish\r\nwere from a pound and a half to three pounds in weight, and of the same\r\nspecies as those found in the tanks in the neighbourhood. They were all\r\ndead and dry. A fall of fish occurred at Allahabad, during a storm in\r\nMay, 1835; they were of the chowla species, and were found dead and dry\r\nafter the storm had passed over the district. On the 20th of September,\r\n1839, after a smart shower of rain, a quantity of live fish, about three\r\ninches in length and all of the same kind, fell at the Sunderbunds,\r\nabout twenty miles south of Calcutta. On this occasion it was remarked\r\nthat the fish did not fall here and there irregularly over the ground,\r\nbut in a continuous straight line, not more than a span in breadth. The\r\nvast multitudes of fish, with which the low grounds round Bombay are\r\ncovered, about a week or ten days after the first burst of the monsoon,\r\nappear to be derived from the adjoining pools or rivulets, and not to\r\ndescend from the sky. They are not, so far as I know, found in the\r\nhigher parts of the island. I have never seen them, (though I have\r\nwatched carefully,) in casks collecting water from the roofs of\r\nbuildings, or heard of them on the decks or awnings of vessels in the\r\nharbour, where they must have appeared had they descended from the sky.\r\nOne of the most remarkable phenomena of this kind occurred during a\r\ntremendous deluge of rain at Kattywar, on the 25th of July, 1850, when\r\nthe ground around Rajkote was found literally covered with fish; some of\r\nthem were found on the tops of haystacks, where probably they had been\r\ndrifted by the storm. In the course of twenty-four successive hours\r\ntwenty-seven inches of rain fell, thirty-five fell in twenty-six hours,\r\nseven inches within one hour and a half, being the heaviest fall on\r\nrecord. At Poonah, on the 3rd of August, 1852, after a very heavy fall\r\nof rain, multitudes of fish were caught on the ground in the\r\ncantonments, full half a mile from the nearest stream. If showers of\r\nfish are to be explained on the assumption that they are carried up by\r\nsqualls or violent winds, from rivers or spaces of water not far away\r\nfrom where they fall, it would be nothing wonderful were they seen to\r\ndescend from the air during the furious squalls which occasionally occur\r\nin June.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE (B.)\r\n\r\nCEYLON FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Memorandum by Professor Huxley._)\r\n\r\nSee Page 324.\r\n\r\nThe large series of beautifully coloured drawings of the fishes of\r\nCeylon, which has been submitted to my inspection, possesses an unusual\r\nvalue for several reasons.\r\n\r\nThe fishes, it appears, were all captured at Colombo, and even had those\r\nfrom other parts of Ceylon been added, the geographical area would not\r\nhave been very extended. Nevertheless there are more than 600 drawings,\r\nand though it is possible that some of these represent varieties in\r\ndifferent stages of growth of the same species, I have not been able to\r\nfind definite evidence of the fact in any of those groups which I have\r\nparticularly tested. If, however, these drawings represent _six hundred_\r\ndistinct species of fish, they constitute, so far as I know, the largest\r\ncollection of fish from one locality in existence.\r\n\r\nThe number of known British fishes may be safely assumed to be less than\r\n250, and Mr. Yarrell enumerates only 226, Dr. Cantor's valuable work on\r\nMalayan fishes enumerates not more than 238, while Dr. Russell has\r\nfigured only 200 from Coromandel. Even the enormous area of the Chinese\r\nand Japanese seas has as yet not yielded 800 species of fishes.\r\n\r\nThe large extent of the collection alone, then, renders it of great\r\nimportance: but its value is immeasurably enhanced by the two\r\ncircumstances,--_first_, that every drawing was made while the fish\r\nretained all that vividness of colouring which becomes lost so soon\r\nafter its removal from its native element; and _secondly_, that when the\r\nsketch was finished its subject was carefully labelled, preserved in\r\nspirits, and forwarded to England, so that at the present moment the\r\noriginal of every drawing can be subjected to anatomical examination,\r\nand compared with already named species.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, I do not hesitate to say that the collection\r\nis one of the most valuable in existence, and might, if properly worked\r\nout, become a large and secure foundation for all future investigation\r\ninto the ichthyology of the Indian Ocean.\r\n\r\nIt would be very hazardous to express an opinion as to the novelty or\r\notherwise of the species and genera figured without the study of the\r\nspecimens themselves, as the specific distinctions of fish are for the\r\nmost part based upon character--the fin-rays, teeth, the operculum, &c.,\r\nwhich can only be made out by close and careful examination of the\r\nobject, and cannot be represented in ordinary drawings however accurate.\r\n\r\nThere are certain groups of fish, however, whose family traits are so\r\nmarked as to render it almost impossible to mistake even their\r\nportraits, and hence I may venture, without fear of being far wrong,\r\nupon a few remarks as to the general features of the ichthyological\r\nfauna of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nIn our own seas rather less than a tenth of the species of fishes belong\r\nto the cod tribe. I have not found one represented in these drawings,\r\nnor do either Russell or Cantor mention any in the surrounding seas, and\r\nthe result is in general harmony with the known laws of distribution of\r\nthese most useful of fishes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the mackerel family, including the tunnies, the\r\nbonitas, the dories, the horse-mackerels, &c., which form not more than\r\none sixteenth of our own fish fauna, but which are known to increase\r\ntheir proportion in hot climates, appear in wonderful variety of form\r\nand colour, and constitute not less than one fifth of the whole of the\r\nspecies of Ceylon fish. In Russell's catalogue they form less than one\r\nfifth, in Cantor's less than one sixth.\r\n\r\nMarine and other siluroid fishes, a group represented on the continent\r\nof Europe, but doubtfully, if at all, in this country, constitute one\r\ntwentieth of the Ceylon fishes. In Russell's and Cantor's lists they\r\nform about one thirtieth of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe sharks and rays form about one seventh of our own fish fauna. They\r\nconstitute about one tenth or one eleventh of Russell's and Cantor's\r\nlists, while among these Ceylon drawings I find not more than twenty, or\r\nabout one thirtieth of the whole, which can be referred to this group of\r\nfishes. It must be extremely interesting to know whether this\r\ncircumstance is owing to accident, or to the local peculiarities of\r\nColombo, or whether the fauna of Ceylon really is deficient in such\r\nfishes.\r\n\r\nThe like exceptional character is to be noticed in the proportion of the\r\ntribe of flat fishes, or _Pleuronectidæ_. Soles, turbots, and the like,\r\nform nearly one twelfth of our own fishes.

In these extemporised wells these fishes are found always in\r\npairs, and I when brought to the surface they glide rapidly over the\r\nground with a serpentine motion. This account appeared in 1839; but some\r\nyears later, Mr. Campbell, the Superintendent of Darjeeling, in a\r\ncommunication to the same journal[2], divested the story of much of its\r\nexaggeration, by stating, as the result of personal inquiry in Bhootan,\r\nthat the _bora-chung_ inhabits the jheels and slow-running streams near\r\nthe hills, but lives principally on the banks, into which it penetrates\r\nfrom one to five or six feet. The entrance to these retreats leading\r\nfrom the river into the bank is generally a few inches below the\r\nsurface, so that the fish can return to the water at pleasure. The mode\r\nof catching them is by introducing the hand into these holes; and the\r\n_bora-chungs_ are found generally two in each chamber, coiled\r\nconcentrically like snakes. It is not believed that they bore their own\r\nburrows, but that they take possession of those made by land-crabs. Mr.\r\nCampbell denies that they are more capable than other fish of moving on\r\ndry ground. From the particulars given, the _bora-chung_ would appear to\r\nbe an _Ophiocephalus_, probably the _O. barka_ described by Buchanan, as\r\ninhabiting holes in the banks of rivers tributary to the Ganges.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Paper by Mr. J.T. PEARSON, _Journ. Asiat. Soc. Beng._, vol.\r\nviii p. 551.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Journ. Asiat. Soc. Beng._, vol. xi. p. 963.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XI.\r\n\r\nSHELLS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Mollusca.--Radiata, &c._\r\n\r\nCeylon has long been renowned for the beauty and variety of the shells\r\nwhich abound in its seas and inland waters, and in which an active trade\r\nhas been organised by the industrious Moors, who clean them with great\r\nexpertness, arrange them in satin-wood boxes, and send them to Colombo\r\nand all parts of the island for sale. In general, however, these\r\nspecimens are more prized for their beauty than valued for their rarity,\r\nthough some of the \"Argus\" cowries[1] have been sold as high as _four\r\nguineas_ a pair.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Cypræa Argus_.]\r\n\r\nOne of the principal sources whence their supplies are derived is the\r\nbeautiful Bay of Venloos, to the north of Batticaloa, formed by the\r\nembouchure of the Natoor river. The scenery at this spot is enchanting.\r\nThe sea is overhung by gentle acclivities wooded to the summit; and in\r\nan opening between two of these eminences the river flows through a\r\ncluster of little islands covered with mangroves and acacias. A bar of\r\nrocks projects across it, at a short distance from the shore; and these\r\nare frequented all day long by pelicans, that come at sunrise to fish,\r\nand at evening return to their solitary breeding-places remote from the\r\nbeach. The strand is literally covered with beautiful shells in rich\r\nprofusion, and the dealers from Trincomalie know the proper season to\r\nvisit the bay for each particular description. The entire coast,\r\nhowever, as far north as the Elephant Pass, is indented by little rocky\r\ninlets, where shells of endless variety may be collected in great\r\nabundance.[1] During the north-east monsoon a formidable surf bursts\r\nupon the shore, which is here piled high with mounds of yellow sand; and\r\nthe remains of shells upon the water mark show how rich the sea is in\r\nmollusca. Amongst them are prodigious numbers of the ubiquitous\r\nviolet-coloured _Ianthina_[2], which rises when the ocean is calm, and\r\nby means of its inflated vesicles floats lightly on the surface.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In one of these beautiful little bays near Catchavelly,\r\nbetween Trincomalie and Batticaloa, I found the sand within the wash of\r\nthe sea literally covered with mollusca and shells, and amongst others a\r\nspecies of _Bullia_ (B. vittata, I think), the inhabitant of which, has\r\nthe faculty of mooring itself firmly by sending down its membranous foot\r\ninto the wet sand, where, imbibing the water, this organ expands\r\nhorizontally into a broad, fleshy disc, by which the animal anchors\r\nitself, and thus secured, collects its food in the ripple of the waves.\r\nOn the slightest alarm, the water is discharged, the disc collapses into\r\nits original dimensions, and the shell and its inhabitant disappear\r\ntogether beneath the sand.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BULLIA VITTATA]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ianthina communis_, Krause and _I. prolongata_, Blainv.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IANTHINA.]\r\n\r\nThe trade in shells is one of extreme antiquity in Ceylon. The Gulf of\r\nManaar has been fished from the earliest times for the large chank\r\nshell, _Turbinella_ _rapa_, to be exported to India, where it is still\r\nsawn into rings and worn as anklets and bracelets by the women of\r\nHindustan. Another use for these shells is their conversion into wind\r\ninstruments, which are sounded in the temples on all occasions of\r\nceremony. A chank, in which the whorls, instead of running from left to\r\nright, as in the ordinary shell, are reversed, and run from right to\r\nleft, is regarded with such reverence that a specimen formerly sold for\r\nits weight in gold, but one may now be had for four or five pounds.\r\nCOSMAS INDICO-PLEUSTES, writing in the fifth century, describes a place\r\non the west coast of Ceylon, which he calls Marallo, and says it\r\nproduced \"[Greek: kochlious],\" which THEVENOT translates \"oysters;\" in\r\nwhich case Marallo might be conjectured to be Bentotte, near Colombo,\r\nwhich yields the best edible \"oysters\" in Ceylon.[1] But the shell in\r\nquestion was most probably the chank, and Marallo was Mantotte, off\r\nwhich it is found in great numbers.[2] In fact, two centuries later\r\nAbouzeyd, an Arab, who wrote an account of the trade and productions of\r\nIndia, speaks of these shells by the name they still bear, which he\r\nstates to be _schenek_[3]; but \"schenek\" is not an Arabic word, and is\r\nmerely an attempt to spell the local term, _chank_, in Arabic\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: COSMAS INDICO-PLEUSTES, in Thevenot's ed. t i. p. 21.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: At Kottiar, near Trincomalie, I was struck with the\r\nprodigious size of the edible oysters, which were brought to us at the\r\nrest-house. The shell of one of these measured a little more than eleven\r\ninches in length, by half as many broad: thus unexpectedly attesting the\r\ncorrectness of one of the stories related by the historians of\r\nAlexander's expedition, that in India they had found oysters a foot\r\nlong. PLINY says: \"In Indico mari Alexandri rerum auctores pedalia\r\ninveniri prodidere.\"--_Nat. Hist._ lib. xxxii. ch. 31. DARWIN says, that\r\namongst the fossils of Patagonia, he found \"a massive gigantic oyster,\r\nsometimes even a foot in diameter.\"--_Nat. Voy._, ch. viii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3:--ABOUZEYD, _Voyages Arabes,_ &c., t. i. p. 6; REINAUD,\r\n_Mémoire sur l'Inde,_ &c p. 222.]\r\n\r\nBERTOLACCI mentions a curious local peculiarity[1] observed by the\r\nfishermen in the natural history of the chank. \"All shells,\" he says,\r\n\"found to the northward of a line drawn from a point about midway from\r\nManaar to the opposite coast (of India) are of the kind called _patty_,\r\nand are distinguished by a short flat head; and all those found to the\r\nsouthward of that line are of the kind called _pajel_, and are known\r\nfrom having a longer and more pointed head than the former. Nor is there\r\never an instance of deviation from this singular law of nature. The\r\n_Wallampory_, or 'right-hand chanks,' are found of both kinds.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See also the _Asiatic Journal for_ 1827, p. 469.]\r\n\r\nThis tendency of particular localities to re-produce certain\r\nspecialities of form and colour is not confined to the sea or to the\r\ninstance of the chank shell. In the gardens which line the suburbs of\r\nGalle in the direction of Matura the stems of the coco-nut and jak trees\r\nare profusely covered with the shells of the beautiful striped _Helix\r\nhamastoma_. Stopping frequently to collect them, I was led to observe\r\nthat each separate garden seemed to possess a variety almost peculiar to\r\nitself; in one the mouth of every individual shell was _red_; in\r\nanother, separated from the first only by a wall, _black_; and in others\r\n(but less frequently) _pure white_; whilst the varieties of external\r\ncolouring were equally local. In one enclosure they were nearly all red,\r\nand in an adjoining one brown.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: DARWIN, in his _Naturalist's Voyage_, mentions a parallel\r\ninstance of the localised propagation of colours amoungst the cattle\r\nwhich range the pasturage of East Falkland Island: \"Round Mount Osborne\r\nabout half of some of the herds were mouse-coloured, a tint no common\r\nanywhere else,--near Mount Pleasant dark-brown prevailed; whereas south\r\nof Choiseul Sound white beasts with black heads and feet were\r\ncommon.\"--Ch. ix. p. 192.]\r\n\r\nA trade more ancient by far than that carried on in chanks, and\r\ninfinitely more renowned, is the fishery of pearls on the west coast of\r\nCeylon, bordering the Gulf of Manaar. No scene in Ceylon presents so\r\ndreary an aspect as the long sweep of desolate shore to which, from time\r\nimmemorial, adventurers have resorted from the uttermost ends of the\r\nearth in search of the precious pearls for which this gulf is renowned.\r\nOn approaching it from sea the only perceptible landmark is a building\r\nerected by Lord Guildford, as a temporary residence for the Governor,\r\nand known by the name of the \"Doric,\" from the style of its\r\narchitecture. A few coco-nut palms appear next above the low sandy\r\nbeach, and presently are discovered the scattered houses which form the\r\nvillages of Aripo and Condatchy.\r\n\r\nBetween these two places, or rather between the Kalaar and Arrive river,\r\nthe shore is raised to a height of many feet, by enormous mounds of\r\nshells, the accumulations of ages, the millions of oysters[1], robbed of\r\ntheir pearls, having been year after year flung into heaps, that extend\r\nfor a distance of many miles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is almost unnecessary to say that the shell fish which\r\nproduces the true Oriental pearls is not an oyster, but belongs to the\r\ngenus Avicula, or more correctly, Meleagrina. It is the _Meleagrina\r\nMargaritifera_ of Lamarck.]\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of a pearl-fishery, this singular and dreary expanse\r\nbecomes suddenly enlivened by the crowds who congregate from distant\r\nparts of India; a town is improvised by the construction of temporary\r\ndwellings, huts of timber and cajans[1], with tents of palm leaves or\r\ncanvas; and bazaars spring up, to feed the multitude on land, as well as\r\nthe seamen and divers in the fleets of boats that cover the bay.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Cajan_ is the local term for the plaited fronds of a\r\ncoco-nut.]\r\n\r\nI visited the pearl banks officially in 1848 in company with Capt.\r\nStenart, the official inspector. My immediate object was to inquire into\r\nthe causes of the suspension of the fisheries, and to ascertain the\r\nprobability of reviving a source of revenue, the gross receipts from\r\nwhich had failed for several years to defray the cost of conservancy. In\r\nfact, between 1837 and 1854, the pearl banks were an annual charge,\r\ninstead of producing an annual income, to the colony. The conjecture,\r\nhastily adopted, to account for the disappearance of mature shells, had\r\nreference to mechanical causes; the received hypothesis being that the\r\nyoung broods had been swept off their accustomed feeding grounds, by the\r\nestablishment of unusual currents, occasioned by deepening the narrow\r\npassage between Ceylon and India at Paumbam. It was also suggested, that\r\na previous Governor, in his eagerness to replenish the colonial\r\ntreasury, had so \"scraped\" and impoverished the beds as to exterminate\r\nthe oysters. To me, neither of these suppositions appeared worthy of\r\nacceptance; for, in the frequent disruptions of Adam's Bridge, there was\r\nample evidence that the currents in the Gulf of Manaar had been changed\r\nat former times without destroying the pearl beds: and moreover the\r\noysters had disappeared on many former occasions, without any imputation\r\nof improper management on the part of the conservators; and returned\r\nafter much longer intervals of absence than that which fell under my own\r\nnotice, and which was then creating serious apprehension in the colony.\r\n\r\nA similar interruption had been experienced between 1820 and 1828: the\r\nDutch had had no fishing for twenty-seven years, from 1768 till 1796[1];\r\nand they had been equally unsuccessful from 1732 till 1746. The Arabs\r\nwere well acquainted with similar vicissitudes, and Albyronni (a\r\ncontemporary of Avicenna), who served under Mahmoud of Ghuznee, and\r\nwrote in the eleventh century, says that the pearl fishery, which\r\nformerly existed in the Gulf of Serendib, had become exhausted in his\r\ntime, simultaneously with the appearance of a fishery at Sofala, in the\r\ncountry of the Zends, where pearls were unknown before; and hence, he\r\nsays, arose the conjecture that the pearl oyster of Serendib had\r\nmigrated to Sofala.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This suspension was in some degree attributable to disputes\r\nwith the Nabob of Arcot and other chiefs, and the proprietors of temples\r\non the opposite coast of India, who claimed, a right to participate in\r\nthe fisheries of the Gulf of Manaar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Il y avait autrefois dans le Golfe de Serendyb, une\r\npêcherie de perles qui s'est épuiseé de notre temps. D'un autre côté il\r\ns'est formé une pêcherie de Sofala dans le pays des Zends, là ou il n'en\r\nexistait pas auparavant--on dit que c'est la pêcherie de Serendyb qui\r\ns'est transportée à Sofala.\"--ALBYROUNI, _in_ RENAUD'S _Fragmens Arabes,\r\n&c_, p. 125; see also REINAUD'S _Mémoire sur l'Inde_, p. 228.]\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me that the explanation of the phenomenon was to be\r\nsought, not merely in external causes, but also in the instincts and\r\nfaculties of the animals themselves, and, on my return to Colombo, I\r\nventured to renew a recommendation, which had been made years before,\r\nthat a scientific inspector should be appointed to study the habits and\r\nthe natural history of the pearl-oyster, and that his investigations\r\nshould be facilitated by the means at the disposal of the Government.\r\n\r\nDr. Kelaart was appointed to this office, by Sir H.G. Ward, in 1857, and\r\nhis researches speedily developed results of great interest. In\r\nopposition to the received opinion that the pearl-oyster is incapable of\r\nvoluntary movement, and unable of itself to quit the place to which it\r\nis originally attached[1], he demonstrated, not only that it possesses\r\nlocomotive powers, but also that their exercise is indispensable to its\r\noeconomy when obliged to search for food, or compelled to escape from\r\nlocal impurities. He showed that, for this purpose, it can sever its\r\nbyssus, and re-form it at pleasure, so as to migrate and moor itself in\r\nfavourable situations.[2] The establishment of this important fact may\r\ntend to solve the mystery of the occasional disappearances of the\r\noyster; and if coupled with the further discovery that it is susceptible\r\nof translation from place to place, and even from salt to brackish\r\nwater, it seems reasonable to expect that beds may be formed with\r\nadvantage in positions suitable for its growth and protection. Thus,\r\nlike the edible oyster of our own shores, the pearl-oyster may be\r\nbrought within the domain of pisciculture, and banks may be created in\r\nsuitable places, just as the southern shores of France are now being\r\ncolonised with oysters, under the direction of M. Coste.[3] The\r\noperation of sowing the sea with pearl, should the experiment succeed,\r\nwould be as gorgeous in reality, as it is grand in conception: and the\r\nwealth of Ceylon, in her \"treasures of the deep,\" might eclipse the\r\nrenown of her gems when she merited the title of the \"Island of Rubies.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: STEUART'S _Pearl Fisheries of Ceylon_, p. 27: CORDINER'S\r\n_Ceylon, &c_, vol. ii. p. 45.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See Dr. KELAART'S Report on the Pearl Oyster in the _Ceylon\r\nCalendar for 1858--Appendix_, p. 14.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Rapport de_ M. COSTE, Professeur d'Embryogénie, &c.,\r\nParis, 1858.]\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at Aripo, the pearl-divers, under the orders of their\r\nAdapanaar, put to sea, and commenced the examination of the banks.[1]\r\nThe persons engaged in this calling are chiefly Tamils and Moors, who\r\nare trained for the service by diving for chanks. The pieces of\r\napparatus employed to assist the diver in his operations are exceedingly\r\nsimple in their character: they consist merely of a stone, about thirty\r\npounds' weight, (to accelerate the rapidity of his descent,) which is\r\nsuspended over the side of the boat, with a loop attached to it for\r\nreceiving the foot; and of a net-work basket, which he takes down to the\r\nbottom and fills with the oysters as he collects them. MASSOUDI, one of\r\nthe earliest Arabian geographers, describing, in the ninth century, the\r\nhabits of the pearl-divers in the Persian Gulf, says that, before\r\ndescending, each filled his ears with cotton steeped in oil, and\r\ncompressed his nostrils by a piece of tortoise-shell.[2] This practice\r\ncontinues there to the present day[3]; but the diver of Ceylon rejects\r\nall such expedients; he inserts his foot in the \"sinking stone\" and\r\ninhales a full breath; presses his nostrils with his left hand; raises\r\nhis body as high as possible above water, to give force to his descent:\r\nand, liberating the stone from its fastenings, he sinks rapidly below\r\nthe surface. As soon as he has reached the bottom, the stone is drawn\r\nup, and the diver, throwing himself on his face, commences with alacrity\r\nto fill his basket with oysters. This, on a concerted signal, is hauled\r\nrapidly to the surface; the diver assisting his own ascent by springing\r\non the rope as it rises.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Detailed accounts of the pearl fishery of Ceylon and the\r\nconduct of the divers, will be found in PERCIVAL's _Ceylon_, ch. iii.:\r\nand in CORDINER'S _Ceylon_, vol. ii. ch. xvi. There is also a valuable\r\npaper on the same subject by Mr. LE BECK, in the _Asiatic Researches_,\r\nvol. v. p. 993; but by far the most able and intelligent description is\r\ncontained in the _Account of the Pearl Fisheries of Ceylon_, by JAMES\r\nSTEUART, Esq., Inspector of the Pearl Banks, 4to. Colombo, 1843.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: MASSOUDI says that the Persian divers, as they could not\r\nbreathe through their nostrils, _cleft the root of the ear_ for that\r\npurpose: \"_Ils se fendaient la racine de l'oreille pour respirer_; en\r\neffet, ils ne peuvent se servir pour cet objet des narines, vu qu'ils se\r\nles bouchent avec des morceaux d'écailles de tortue marine on bien avec\r\ndes morceaux de corne ayant la forme d'un fer de lance. En même temps\r\nils se mettent dans l'oreille du coton trempé dans de\r\nl'huile.\"--_Moroudj-al-Dzeheb,_ &c., REINAUD, _Mémoire sur l'Inde,_ p.\r\n228.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Colonel WILSON says they compress the nose with horn, and\r\nclose the ears with beeswax. See _Memorandum on the Pearl Fisheries in\r\nPersian Gulf.--Journ. Geogr. Soc._ 1833, vol. iii. p. 283.]\r\n\r\nImprobable tales have been told of the capacity which these men acquire\r\nof remaining for prolonged periods under water. The divers who attended\r\non this occasion were amongst the most expert on the coast, yet not one\r\nof them was able to complete a full minute below. Captain Steuart, who\r\nfilled for many years the office of Inspector of the Pearl Banks,\r\nassured me that he had never known a diver to continue at the bottom\r\nlonger than eighty-seven seconds, nor to attain a greater depth than\r\nthirteen fathoms; and on ordinary occasions they seldom exceeded\r\nfifty-five seconds in nine fathom water[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: RIBEYRO says that a diver could remain below whilst two\r\n_credos_ were being repeated: \"Il s'y tient l'espace de deux\r\n_credo_.\"--Lib. i. ch. xxii. p. 169. PERCIVAL says the usual time for\r\nthem to be under water was two minutes, but that some divers stayed\r\n_four_ or _five_, and one _six_ minutes,--_Ceylon_ p. 91; LE BECK says\r\nthat in 1797 he saw a Caffre boy from Karical remain down for the space\r\nof seven minutes.--_Asiat. Res_ vol. v. p. 402.]\r\n\r\nThe only precaution to which the Ceylon diver devotedly resorts, is the\r\nmystic ceremony of the shark-charmer, whose exorcism is an indispensable\r\npreliminary to every fishery. His power is believed to be hereditary;\r\nnor is it supposed that the value of his incantations is at all\r\ndependent upon the religious faith professed by the operator, for the\r\npresent head of the family happens to be a Roman Catholic. At the time\r\nof our visit this mysterious functionary was ill and unable to attend;\r\nbut he sent an accredited substitute, who assured me that although he\r\nhimself was ignorant of the grand and mystic secret, the mere fact of\r\nhis presence, as a representative of the higher authority, would be\r\nrecognised and respected by the sharks.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, though the Gulf of Manaar abounds with these hideous\r\ncreatures, not more than one well authenticated accident[1] is known to\r\nhave occurred from this source during any pearl fishery since the\r\nBritish have had possession of Ceylon. In all probability the reason is\r\nthat the sharks are alarmed by the unusual number of boats, the\r\nmultitude of divers, the noise of the crews, the incessant plunging of\r\nthe sinking stones, and the descent and ascent of the baskets filled\r\nwith shells. The dark colour of the divers themselves may also be a\r\nprotection; whiter skins might not experience an equal impunity.\r\nMassoudi relates that the divers of the Persian Gulf were so conscious\r\nof this advantage of colour, that they were accustomed to blacken their\r\nlimbs, in order to baffle the sea monsters.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: CORDINER'S _Ceylon_, vol. ii p. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Ils s'enduisaient les pieds et les jambes d'une substance\r\nnoirâtre, atin de faire peur aux monstres marins, que, sans cela,\r\nseraient tentés de les dévorer.\"--_Moroudj-al-Dzekeb,_ REINAUD, _Mém.\r\nsur l'Inde_, p. 228.]\r\n\r\nThe result of our examination of the pearl banks, on this occasion, was\r\nsuch as to discourage the hope of an early fishery. The oysters in point\r\nof number were abundant, but in size they were little more than \"spat,\"\r\nthe largest being barely a fourth of an inch in diameter. As at least\r\nseven years are required to furnish the growth at which pearls may be\r\nsought with advantage[1], the inspection served only to suggest the\r\nprospect (which has since been realised) that in time the income from\r\nthis source might be expected to revive;--and, forced to content\r\nourselves with this anticipation, we weighed anchor from Condatchy, on\r\nthe 30th March, and arrived on the following day at Colombo.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Along with this two plates are given from drawings made for\r\nthe Official Inspector, and exhibiting the ascertained size of the pearl\r\noyster at every period of its growth, from the \"spat\" to the mature\r\nshell. The young \"brood\" are shown at Nos. 1 and 2. The shell at four\r\nmonths old, No. 3, No. 4. six months, No. 5. one year, No. 6, two years.\r\nThe second plate exhibits the shell at its full growth.]\r\n\r\nThe banks of Aripo are not the only localities, nor is the _acicula_ the\r\nonly mollusc, by which pearls are furnished. The Bay of Tamblegam,\r\nconnected with the magnificent harbour of Trincomalie, is the seat of\r\nanother pearl fishery, and the shell which produces them is the thin\r\ntransparent oyster (_Placuna placenta_). whose clear white shells are\r\nused, in China and elsewhere, as a substitute for window glass. They are\r\nalso collected annually for the sake of the diminutive pearls contained\r\nin them. These are exported to the coast of India, to be calcined for\r\nlime, which the luxurious affect to chew with their betel. These pearls\r\nare also burned in the mouths of the dead. So prolific are the mollusca\r\nof the _Placuna_, that the quantity of shells taken by the licensed\r\nrenter in the three years prior to 1858, could not have been less than\r\neighteen millions.[1] They delight in brackish water, and on more than\r\none recent occasion, an excess of either salt water or fresh has proved\r\nfatal to great numbers of them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Report of_ Dr. KELAART, Oct. 1857.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEARL OYSTER.\r\n\r\n1, 2. The young brood or spat.\r\n3. Four months old.\r\n4. Six months old.\r\n5. One year old.\r\n6. Two years old.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEARL OYSTER. Full Growth.]\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of a visit which I made to Batticaloa. in September,\r\n1848, I made some inquiries relative to a story which had reached me of\r\nmusical sounds, said to be often heard issuing from the bottom of the\r\nlake, at several places, both above and below the ferry opposite the old\r\nDutch Fort; and which the natives suppose to proceed from some fish\r\npeculiar to the locality. The report was confirmed in all its\r\nparticulars, and one of the spots whence the sounds proceed was pointed\r\nout between the pier and a rock that intersects the channel, two or\r\nthree hundred yards to the eastward. They were said to be heard at\r\nnight, and most distinctly when the moon was nearest the full, and they\r\nwere described as resembling the faint sweet notes of an Æolian harp. I\r\nsent for some of the fishermen, who said they were perfectly aware of\r\nthe fact, and that their fathers had always known of the existence of\r\nthe musical sounds, heard, they said, at the spot alluded to, but only\r\nduring the dry season, as they cease when the lake is swollen by the\r\nfreshes after the rain. They believed them to proceed not from a fish,\r\nbut from a shell, which is known by the Tamil name of (_oorie cooleeroo\r\ncradoo_, or) the \"crying shell,\" a name in which the sound seems to have\r\nbeen adopted as an echo to the sense. I sent them in search of the\r\nshell, and they returned bringing me some living specimens of different\r\nshells, chiefly _littorina_ and _cerithium._[1]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CERITHIUM PALUSTRE.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Littorina lævis. Cerithium palustre._ Of the latter the\r\nspecimens brought to me were dwarfed and solid, exhibiting in this\r\nparticular the usual peculiarities that distinguish (1) shells\r\ninhabiting a rocky locality from (2) their congeners in a sandy bottom.\r\nTheir longitudinal development was less, with greater breadth, and\r\nincreased strength and weight.]\r\n\r\nIn the evening when the moon rose, I took a boat and accompanied the\r\nfishermen to the spot. We rowed about two hundred yards north-east of\r\nthe jetty by the fort gate; there was not a breath of wind, nor a ripple\r\nexcept those caused by the dip of our oars. On coming to the point\r\nmentioned, I distinctly heard the sounds in question. They came up from\r\nthe water like the gentle thrills of a musical chord, or the faint\r\nvibrations of a wine-glass when its rim is rubbed by a moistened finger.\r\nIt was not one sustained note, but a multitude of tiny, sounds, each\r\nclear and distinct in itself; the sweetest treble mingling with the\r\nlowest bass. On applying the ear to the woodwork of the boat, the\r\nvibration was greatly increased in volume. The sounds varied\r\nconsiderably at different points, as we moved across the lake, as if the\r\nnumber of the animals from which they proceeded was greatest in\r\nparticular spots; and occasionally we rowed out of hearing of them\r\naltogether, until on returning to the original locality the sounds were\r\nat once renewed.\r\n\r\nThis fact seems to indicate that the causes of the sounds, whatever they\r\nmay be, are stationary at several points; and this agrees with the\r\nstatement of the natives, that they are produced by mollusca, and not by\r\nfish. They came evidently and sensibly from the depth of the lake, and\r\nthere was nothing in the surrounding circumstances to support the\r\nconjecture that they could be the reverberation of noises made by\r\ninsects on the shore conveyed along the surface of the water; for they\r\nwere loudest and most distinct at points where the nature of the land,\r\nand the intervention of the fort and its buildings, forbade the\r\npossibility of this kind of conduction.\r\n\r\nSounds somewhat similar are heard under water at some places on the\r\nwestern coast of India, especially in the harbour of Bombay.[1] At\r\nCaldera, in Chili, musical cadences are stated to issue from the sea\r\nnear the landing-place; they are described as rising and falling fully\r\nfour notes, resembling the tones of harp strings, and mingling like\r\nthose at Batticaloa, till they produce a musical discord of great\r\ndelicacy and sweetness. The same interesting phenomenon has been\r\nobserved at the mouth of the Pascagoula, in the State of Mississippi,\r\nand of another river called the \"Bayou coq del Inde,\" on the northern\r\nshore of the Gulf of Mexico. The animals from which they proceed have\r\nnot been identified at either of these places, and the mystery remains\r\nunsolved, whether the sounds at Batticaloa are given forth by fishes or\r\nby molluscs.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: These sounds are thus described by Dr. BUIST in the _Bombay\r\nTimes_ of January 1847: \"A party lately crossing from the promontory in\r\nSalsette called the 'Neat's Tongue,' to near Sewree, were, about sunset,\r\nstruck by hearing long distinct sounds like the protracted booming of a\r\ndistant bell, the dying cadence of an Æolian harp, the note of a\r\npitchpipe or pitch-fork, or any other long-drawn-out musical note. It\r\nwas, at first, supposed to be music from Parell floating at intervals on\r\nthe breeze; then it was perceived to come from all directions, almost in\r\nequal strength, and to arise from the surface of the water all around\r\nthe vessel. The boatmen at once intimated that the sounds were produced\r\nby fish, abounding in the muddy creeks and shoals around Bombay and\r\nSalsette; they were perfectly well known, and very often heard.\r\nAccordingly, on inclining the ear towards the surface of the water; or,\r\nbetter still, by placing it close to the planks of the vessel, the notes\r\nappeared loud and distinct, and followed each other in constant\r\nsuccession. The boatmen next day produced specimens of the fish--a\r\ncreature closely resembling, in size and shape the fresh-water perch of\r\nthe north of Europe--and spoke of them as plentiful and perfectly well\r\nknown. It is hoped they may be procured alive, and the means afforded of\r\ndetermining how the musical sounds are produced and emitted, with other\r\nparticulars of interest supposed new in Ichthyology. We shall be\r\nthankful to receive from our readers any information they can give us in\r\nregard to a phenomenon which does not appear to have been heretofore\r\nnoticed, and which cannot fail to attract the attention of the\r\nnaturalist. Of the perfect accuracy with which the singular facts above\r\nrelated have been given, no doubt will be entertained when it is\r\nmentioned that the writer was one of a party of five intelligent\r\npersons, by all of whom they were most carefully observed, and the\r\nimpressions of all of whom in regard to them were uniform. It is\r\nsupposed that the fish are confined to particular localities--shallows,\r\nestuaries, and muddy creeks, rarely visited by Europeans; and that this\r\nis the reason why hitherto no mention, so far as we know, has been made\r\nof the peculiarity in any work on Natural History.\"\r\n\r\nThis communication elicited one from Vizagapatam, relative to \"musical\r\nsounds like the prolonged notes on the harp\" heard to proceed from under\r\nwater at that station. It appeared in the _Bombay Times_ of Feb. 13,\r\n1849.]\r\n\r\nCertain fishes are known to utter sounds when removed from the water[1],\r\nand some are capable of making noises when under it[2]; but all the\r\ncircumstances connected with the sounds which I heard at Batticaloa are\r\nunfavourable to the conjecture that they were produced by either.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Cuckoo Gurnard (_Triglia cuculus_) and the maigre\r\n(_Sciæna aquila_) utter sounds when taken out of the water (YARRELL,\r\nvol. i. p. 44, 107); and herrings when the net has just been drawn have\r\nbeen observed to do the same. This effect has been attributed to the\r\nescape of air from the air bladder, but no air bladder has been found in\r\nthe _Cottus_, which makes a similar noise.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The fishermen assert that a fish about five inches in\r\nlength, found in the lake at Colombo, and called by them \"_magoora_,\"\r\nmakes a grunt when disturbed under water. PALLEGOIX, in his account of\r\nSiam, speaks of a fish resembling a sole, but of brilliant colouring\r\nwith black spots, which the natives call the \"dog's tongue,\" that\r\nattaches itself to the bottom of a boat, \"et fait entendre un bruit\r\ntrès-sonore et même harmonieux.\"--Tom. i. p. 194. A _Silurus_, found in\r\nthe Rio Parana, and called the \"armado,\" is remarkable for making a\r\nharsh grating noise when caught by hook or line, which can be distinctly\r\nheard when the fish is beneath the water. DARWIN, _Nat. Journ._ ch. vii.\r\nAristotle and Ælian were aware of the existence of this faculty in some\r\nof the fishes of the Mediterranean. ARISTOTLE, _De Anim_., lib. iv. ch.\r\nix.; ÆLIAN, _De Nat. Anim._, lib. x. ch. xi.; see also PLINY, lib. ix.\r\nch. vii.. lib. xi. ch. cxiii.; ATHENÆUS, lib. vii. ch. iii. vi. I have\r\nheard of sounds produced under water at Baltimore, and supposed to be\r\nproduced by the \"cat-fish;\" and at Swan River in Australia, where they\r\nare ascribed to the \"trumpeter.\" A similar noise heard in the Tagus is\r\nattributed by the Lisbon fishermen to the \"_Corvina_\"--but what fish is\r\nmeant by that name, I am unable to tell.]\r\n\r\nOrgans of hearing have been clearly ascertained to exist, mot only in\r\nfishes[1], but in mollusca. In the oyster the presence of an acoustic\r\napparatus of the simplest possible construction has been established by\r\nthe discoveries of Siebold[2], and from our knowledge of the reciprocal\r\nrelations existing between the faculties of hearing and of producing\r\nsounds, the ascertained existence of the one affords legitimate grounds\r\nfor inferring the coexistence of the other in animals of the same\r\nclass.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: AGASSIZ, _Comparative Physiology_, sec. ii. 158.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It consists of two round vesicles containing fluid, and\r\ncrystalline or elliptical calcareous particles or otolites, remarkable\r\nfor their oscillatory action in the living or recently killed animal.\r\nOWEN'S _Lectures on the Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of the\r\nInvertebrate Animals_, 1855, p. 511-552.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I am informed that Professor MÜLLER read a paper on\r\n\"Musical fishes\" before the Academy of Berlin, in 1856. It will probably\r\nbe found in the volume of MÜLLER'S _Archiv. für Physiologie_ for that\r\nyear; but I have not had an opportunity of reading it.]\r\n\r\nBesides, it has been clearly established, that one at least of the\r\ngasteropoda is furnished with the power of producing sounds. Dr. Grant,\r\nin 1826, communicated to the Edinburgh Philosophical Society the fact,\r\nthat on placing some specimens of the _Tritonia arborescens_ in a glass\r\nvessel filled with sea water, his attention was attracted by a noise\r\nwhich he ascertained to proceed from these mollusca. It resembled the\r\n\"clink\" of a steel wire on the side of the jar, one stroke only being\r\ngiven at a time, and repeated at short intervals.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Edinburgh Philosophical Journ_., vol. xiv. p. 188. See\r\nalso the Appendix to this chapter.]\r\n\r\nThe affinity of structure between the _Tritonia_ and the mollusca\r\ninhabiting the shells brought to me at Batticaloa, might justify the\r\nbelief of the natives of Ceylon, that the latter are the authors of the\r\nsounds I heard; and the description of those emitted by the former as\r\ngiven by Dr. Grant, so nearly resemble them, that I have always\r\nregretted my inability, on the occasion of my visits to Batticaloa, to\r\ninvestigate the subject more narrowly. At subsequent periods I have\r\nsince renewed my efforts, but without success, to obtain specimens or\r\nobservations of the habits of the living mollusca.\r\n\r\nThe only species afterwards sent to me were _Cerithia_; but no vigilance\r\nsufficed to catch the desired sounds, and I still hesitate to accept the\r\ndictum of the fishermen, as the same mollusc abounds in all the other\r\nbrackish estuaries on the coast; and it would be singular, if true, that\r\nthe phenomenon of its uttering a musical note should be confined to a\r\nsingle spot in the lagoon of Batticaloa.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The letter which I received from Dr. Grant on this subject,\r\nI have placed in a note to the present chapter, in the hope that it may\r\nstimulate some other inquirer in Ceylon to prosecute the investigation\r\nwhich I was unable to carry out successfully.]\r\n\r\nAlthough naturalists have long been familiar with the marine testacea of\r\nCeylon, no successful attempt has yet been made to form a classified\r\ncatalogue of the species; and I am indebted to the eminent conchologist,\r\nMr. Sylvanus Hanley, for the list which accompanies this notice.\r\n\r\nIn drawing it up, Mr. Hanley observes that he found it a task of more\r\ndifficulty than would at first be surmised, owing to the almost total\r\nabsence of reliable data from which to construct it. Three sources were\r\navailable: collections formed by resident naturalists, the contents of\r\nthe well-known satin-wood boxes prepared at Trincomalie, and the\r\nlaborious elimination of locality from the habitats ascribed to all the\r\nknown species in the multitude of works on conchology in general.\r\n\r\nBut, unfortunately, the first resource proved fallacious. There is no\r\nlarge collection in this country composed exclusively of Ceylon\r\nshells;--and as the very few cabinets rich in the marine treasures of\r\nthe island have been filled as much by purchase as by personal exertion,\r\nthere is an absence of the requisite confidence that all professing to\r\nbe Singhalese have been actually captured in the island and its waters.\r\n\r\nThe cabinets arranged by the native dealers, though professing to\r\ncontain the productions of Ceylon, include shells which have been\r\nobtained from other islands in the Indian seas; and the information\r\ncontained in books, probably from these very circumstances, is either\r\nobscure or deceptive. The old writers content themselves with assigning\r\nto any particular shell the too-comprehensive habitat of \"the Indian\r\nOcean,\" and seldom discriminate between a specimen from Ceylon and one\r\nfrom the Eastern Archipelago or Hindustan. In a very few instances,\r\nCeylon has been indicated with precision as the habitat of particular\r\nshells, but even here the views of specific essentials adopted by modern\r\nconchologists, and the subdivisions established in consequence, leave us\r\nin doubt for which of the described forms the collective locality should\r\nbe retained.\r\n\r\nValuable notices of Ceylon shells are to be found in detached papers, in\r\nperiodicals, and in the scientific surveys of exploring voyages. The\r\nauthentic facts embodied in the monographs of REEVE, KUSTER, SOWERBY,\r\nand KIENER, have greatly enlarged our knowledge of the marine testacea;\r\nand the land and fresh-water mollusca have been similarly illustrated by\r\nthe contributions of BENSON and LAYARD to the _Annals of Natural\r\nHistory_.\r\n\r\nThe dredge has been used, but only in a few insulated spots along the\r\ncoasts of Ceylon; European explorers have been rare; and the natives,\r\nanxious only to secure the showy and saleable shells of the sea, have\r\nneglected the less attractive ones of the land and the lakes. Hence Mr.\r\nHanley finds it necessary to premise that the list appended, although\r\nthe result of infinite labour and research, is less satisfactory than\r\ncould have been wished. \"It is offered,\" he says, \"with diffidence, not\r\npretending to the merit of completeness as a shell-fauna of the island,\r\nbut rather as a form, which the zeal of other collectors may hereafter\r\nelaborate and fill up.\"\r\n\r\nLooking at the little that has yet been done, compared with the vast and\r\nalmost untried field which invites explorers, an assiduous collector may\r\nquadruple the species hitherto described. The minute shells especially\r\nmay be said to be unknown; a vigilant examination of the corals and\r\nexcrescences upon the spondyli and pearl-oysters would signally increase\r\nour knowledge of the Rissoæ, Chemnitziæ, and other perforating testacea,\r\nwhilst the dredge from the deep water will astonish the amateur by the\r\nwholly new forms it can scarcely fail to display.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_List of Ceylon Shells._\r\n\r\nThe arrangement here adopted is a modified Lamarckian one, very similar\r\nto that used by Reeve and Sowerby, and by Mr. HANLEY, in his\r\n_Illustrated Catalogue of Recent Shells_.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Below will be found a general reference to the Works or\r\nPapers in which are given descriptive notices of the shells contained in\r\nthe following list; the names of the authors (in full or abbreviated)\r\nbeing, as usual, annexed to each species.\r\n\r\nADAMS, _Proceed.

This fact gives to\r\nCeylon specimens an importance which can only be appreciated by\r\ncollectors and the students of Mollusca.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. RADIATA.\r\n\r\nThe eastern seas are profusely stocked with radiated animals, but it is\r\nto be regretted that they have as yet received but little attention from\r\nEnglish naturalists. Recently, however, Dr. Kelaart has devoted himself\r\nto the investigation of some of the Singhalese species, and has\r\npublished his discoveries in the Journal of the Ceylon Branch of the\r\nAsiatic Society for 1856-8. Our information respecting the radiata on\r\nthe confines of the island is, therefore, very scanty; with the\r\nexception of the genera[1] examined by him. Hence the notice of this\r\nextensive class of animals must be limited to indicating a few of those\r\nwhich exhibit striking peculiarities, or which admit of the most common\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Actinia, 9 sp.; Anthea, 4 sp.; Actinodendron, 3 sp.;\r\nDioscosoma, 1 sp.; Peechea, 1 sp.; Zoanthura, 1 sp.]\r\n\r\n_Star Fish_.--Very large species of _Ophiuridæ_ are to be met with at\r\nTrincomalie, crawling busily about, and insinuating their long\r\nserpentine arms into the irregularities and perforations in the rocks.\r\nTo these they attach themselves with such a firm grasp, especially when\r\nthey perceive that they have attracted attention, that it is almost\r\nimpossible to procure unmutilated specimens without previously depriving\r\nthem of life, or at least modifying their muscular tenacity. The upper\r\nsurface is of a dark purple colour, and coarsely spined; the arms of the\r\nlargest specimens are more than a foot in length, and very fragile.\r\n\r\nThe star fishes, with immovable rays[1], are by no means rare; many\r\nkinds are brought up in the nets, or maybe extracted from the stomachs\r\nof the larger market fish. One very large species[2], figured by\r\nJoinville in the manuscript volume in the library at the India House, is\r\nnot uncommon; it has thick arms, from which and the disc numerous large\r\nfleshy cirrhi of a bright crimson colour project downwards, giving the\r\ncreature a remarkable aspect. No description of it, so far as I am\r\naware, has appeared in any systematic work on zoology.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Asterias_, Linn.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Pentaceros?_]\r\n\r\n_Sea Slugs_.--There are a few species of _Holothuria_, of which the\r\ntrepang is the best known example. It is largely collected in the Gulf\r\nof Manaar, and dried in the sun to prepare it for export to China. A\r\ngood description and figures of its varieties are still desiderata.\r\n\r\n_Parasitic Worms_.--Of these entozoa, the _Filaria medinensis_, or\r\nGuinea-worm, which burrows in the cellular tissue under the skin, is\r\nwell known in the north of the island, but rarely found in the damper\r\ndistricts of the south and west. In Ceylon, as elsewhere, the natives\r\nattribute its occurrence to drinking the waters of particular wells; but\r\nthis belief is inconsistent with the fact that its lodgment in the human\r\nbody is almost always effected just above the ankle. This shows that the\r\nminute parasites are transferred to the skin of the leg from the moist\r\nvegetation bordering the footpaths leading to wells. At this period the\r\ncreatures are very small, and the process of insinuation is painless and\r\nimperceptible. It is only when they attain to considerable size, a foot\r\nor more in length, that the operation of extracting them is resorted to,\r\nwhen exercise may have given rise to inconvenience and inflammation.\r\n\r\nThese pests in all probability received their popular name of\r\n_Guinea-worms_, from the narrative of Bruno or Braun, a citizen and\r\nsurgeon of Basle, who about the year 1611 made several voyages to that\r\npart of the African coast, and on his return published, amongst other\r\nthings, an account of the local diseases.[1] But Linschoten, the Dutch\r\nnavigator, had previously observed the same worms at Ormus in 1584, and\r\nthey are thus described, together with the method of removing them, in\r\nthe English version of his voyage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In DE BRY'S, _Collect_, vol. i. p. 49.]\r\n\r\n\"There is in Ormus a sickenesse or common plague of wormes, which growe\r\nin their legges, it is thought that they proceede of the water that they\r\ndrink. These wormes are like, unto lute strings, and about two or three\r\nfadomes longe, which they must plucke out and winde them aboute a straw\r\nor a feather, everie day some part thereof, so longe as they feele them\r\ncreepe; and when they hold still, letting it rest in that sort till the\r\nnext daye, they bind it fast and annoynt the hole, and the swelling from\r\nwhence it commeth foorth, with fresh butter, and so in ten or twelve\r\ndayes, they winde them out without any let, in the meanetime they must\r\nsit still with their legges, for if it should breake, they should not,\r\nwithout great paine get it out of their legge, as I have seen some men\r\ndoe.\" [1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: JOHN HUIGHEN VAN LINSCHOTEN _his Discours of Voyages into\r\nthe Easte and West Indies._ London, 1599, p, 16.]\r\n\r\nThe worm is of a whitish colour, sometimes inclining to brown. Its\r\nthickness is from a half to two-thirds of a line, and its length has\r\nsometimes reached to ten or twelve feet. Small specimens have been found\r\nbeneath the tunica conjunctiva of the eye; and one species of the same\r\ngenus of _Nematoidea_ infests the cavity of the eye itself.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: OWEN'S _Lectures on the Invertebrata_, p. 96.]\r\n\r\n_Planaria_.--In the journal already mentioned, Dr. Kelaart has given\r\ndescriptions of fifteen species of planaria, and four of a new genus,\r\ninstituted by him for the reception of those differing from the normal\r\nkinds by some peculiarities which they exhibit in common. At Point\r\nPedro, Mr. Edgar Layard met with one on the bark of trees, after heavy\r\nrain, which would appear to belong to the subgenus _geoplana_.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"A curious species, which is of a light brown above, white\r\nunderneath; very broad and thin, and has a peculiarly shaped tail,\r\nhalf-moon-shaped in fact, like a grocer's cheese knife.\"]\r\n\r\n_Acalephæ_.--Acalephæ[1] are plentiful, so much so, indeed, that they\r\noccasionally tempt the larger cetacea into the Gulf of Manaar. In the\r\ncalmer months of the year, when the sea is glassy, and for hours\r\ntogether undisturbed by a ripple, the minute descriptions are rendered\r\nperceptible by their beautiful prismatic tinting. So great is their\r\ntransparency that they are only to be distinguished from the water by\r\nthe return to the eye of the reflected light that glances from their\r\ndelicate and polished surfaces. Less frequently they are traced by the\r\nfaint hues of their tiny peduncles, arms, or tentaculæ; and it has been\r\nwell observed that they often give the seas in which they abound the\r\nappearance of being crowded with flakes of half-melted snow. The larger\r\nkinds, when undisturbed in their native haunts, attain to considerable\r\nsize. A faintly blue medusa, nearly a foot across, may be seen in the\r\nGulf of Manaar, where, no doubt, others of still larger growth are to be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Jelly-fish.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PHYSALUS URTICULUS.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally after storms, the beach at Colombo is strewn with the thin\r\ntransparent globes of the \"Portuguese Man of War,\" _Physalus urticulus_,\r\nwhich are piled upon the lines left by the waves, like globules of glass\r\ndelicately tinted with purple and blue. They sting, as their trivial\r\nname indicates, like a nettle when incautiously touched.\r\n\r\n_Red infusoria_.--On both sides of the island (but most frequently on\r\nthe west), during the south-west monsoon, a broad expanse of the sea\r\nassumes a red tinge, considerably brighter than brick-dust; and this is\r\nconfined to a space so distinct that a line seems to separate it from\r\nthe green water which flows on either side. Observing at Colombo that\r\nthe whole area so tinged changed its position without parting with any\r\nportion of its colouring, I had some of the water brought on shore, and,\r\non examination with the microscope, found it to be filled with\r\n_infusoria_, probably similar to those which have been noticed near the\r\nshores of South America, and whose abundance has imparted a name to the\r\n\"Vermilion Sea\" off the coast of California.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The late Dr. BUIST, of Bombay, in commenting on this\r\nstatement, writes to the _Athenæum_ that: \"The red colour with which the\r\nsea is tinged, round the shores of Ceylon, during a part of the S.W.\r\nmonsoon is due to the _Proto-coccus nivalis_, or the Himatta-coccus,\r\nwhich presents different colours at different periods of the\r\nyear--giving us the seas of milk as well as those of blood. The coloured\r\nwater at times is to be seen all along the coast north to Kurrachee, and\r\nfar out, and of a much more intense tint in the Arabian Sea. The\r\nfrequency of its appearance in the Red Sea has conferred on it its\r\nname.\"]\r\n\r\nThe remaining orders, including the corals, madrepores, and other\r\npolypi, have yet to find a naturalist to undertake their investigation,\r\nbut in all probability the new species are not very numerous.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nTRITONIA ARBORESCENS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is the letter of Dr. Grant, referred to at page 385:--\r\n\r\nSir,--I have perused, with much interest, your remarkable communication\r\nreceived yesterday, respecting the musical sounds which you heard\r\nproceeding from under water, on the east coast of Ceylon. I cannot\r\nparallel the phenomenon you witnessed at Batticaloa, as produced by\r\nmarine animals, with anything with which my past experience has made me\r\nacquainted in marine zoology. Excepting the faint clink of the _Tritonia\r\narborescens_, repeated only once every minute or two, and apparently\r\nproduced by the mouth armed with two dense horny laminæ, I am not aware\r\nof any sounds produced in the sea by branchiated invertebrata. It is to\r\nbe regretted that in the memorandum you have not mentioned your\r\nobservations on the living specimens brought you by the sailors as the\r\nanimals which produced the sounds. Your authentication of the hitherto\r\nunknown fact, would probably lead to the discovery of the same\r\nphenomenon in other common accessible paludinæ, and other allied\r\nbranchiated animals, and to the solution of a problem, which is still to\r\nme a mystery, even regarding the _tritonia_.\r\n\r\nMy two living _tritonia_, contained in a large clear colourless glass\r\ncylinder, filled with pure sea water, and placed on the central table of\r\nthe Wernerian Natural History Society of Edinburgh, around which many\r\nmembers were sitting, continued to clink audibly within the distance of\r\ntwelve feet during the whole meeting. These small animals were\r\nindividually not half the size of the last joint of my little finger.\r\nWhat effect the mellow sounds of millions of these, covering the shallow\r\nbottom of a tranquil estuary, in the silence of night, might produce, I\r\ncan scarcely conjecture.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of your authentication, and of all geological explanation\r\nof the continuous sounds, and of all source of fallacy from the hum and\r\nbuzz of living creatures in the air or on the land, or swimming on the\r\nwaters, I must say that I should be inclined to seek for the source of\r\nsounds so audible as those you describe rather among the pulmonated\r\nvertebrata, which swarm in the depths of these seas--as fishes, serpents\r\n(of which my friend Dr. Cantor has described about twelve species he\r\nfound in the Bay of Bengal), turtles, palmated birds, pinnipedous and\r\ncetaceous mammalia, &c.\r\n\r\nThe publication of your memorandum in its present form, though not quite\r\nsatisfactory, will, I think, be eminently calculated to excite useful\r\ninquiry into a neglected and curious part of the economy of nature.\r\n\r\nI remain, Sir,\r\n\r\nYours most respectfully,\r\n\r\nROBERT E. GRANT.\r\n\r\n_Sir J. Emerson Tennent, &c. &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. XII.\r\n\r\nINSECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOwing to the favourable combination of heat, moisture, and vegetation,\r\nthe myriads of insects in Ceylon form one of the characteristic features\r\nof the island. In the solitude of the forests there is a perpetual music\r\nfrom their soothing and melodious hum, which frequently swells to a\r\nstartling sound as the cicada trills his sonorous drum on the sunny bark\r\nof some tall tree. At morning the dew hangs in diamond drops on the\r\nthreads and gossamer which the spiders suspend across every pathway; and\r\nabove the pool dragon-flies, of more than metallic lustre, flash in the\r\nearly sunbeams. The earth teems with countless ants, which emerge from\r\nbeneath its surface, or make their devious highways to ascend to their\r\nnests in the trees. Lustrous beetles, with their golden elytra, bask on\r\nthe leaves, whilst minuter species dash through the air in circles,\r\nwhich the ear can follow by the booming of their tiny wings. Butterflies\r\nof large size and gorgeous colouring, flutter over the endless expanse\r\nof flowers, and at times the extraordinary sight presents itself of\r\nflights of these delicate creatures, generally of a white or pale yellow\r\nhue, apparently miles in breadth, and of such prodigious extension as to\r\noccupy hours, and even days, uninterruptedly in their passage--whence\r\ncoming no one knows; whither going no one can tell.[1] As day declines,\r\nthe moths issue from their retreats, the crickets add their shrill\r\nvoices to swell the din; and when darkness descends, the eye is charmed\r\nwith the millions of emerald lamps lighted up by the fire-flies amidst\r\nthe surrounding gloom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The butterflies I have seen in these wonderful migrations\r\nin Ceylon were mostly _Callidryas Hilariæ, C. Alcmeone_, and _C.\r\nPyranthe_, with straggling individuals of the genus _Euplæa, E. Coras_,\r\nand _E. Prothoe_. Their passage took place in April and May, generally\r\nin a north-easterly direction. The natives have a superstitious belief\r\nthat their flight is ultimately directed to Adam's Peak, and that their\r\npilgrimage ends on reaching the sacred mountain. A friend of mine\r\ntravelling from Kandy to Kornegalle, drove for nine miles through a\r\ncloud of white butterflies, which were passing across the road by which\r\nhe went.]\r\n\r\nAs yet no attempt has been made to describe the insects of Ceylon\r\nsystematically, much less to enumerate the prodigous number of species\r\nthat abound in every locality. Occasional observers have, from time to\r\ntime, contributed notices of particular families to the Scientific\r\nAssociations of Europe, but their papers remain undigested, and the time\r\nhas not yet arrived for the preparation of an Entomology of the island.\r\n\r\nWhat DARWIN remarks of the Coleoptera of Brazil is nearly as applicable\r\nto the same order of insects in Ceylon: \"The number of minute and\r\nobscurely coloured beetles is exceedingly great; the cabinets of Europe\r\ncan as yet, with partial exceptions, boast only of the larger species\r\nfrom tropical climates, and it is sufficient to disturb the composure of\r\nan entomologist to look forward to the future dimensions of a catalogue\r\nwith any pretensions to completeness.\"[1] M. Nietner, a German\r\nentomologist, who has spent some years in Ceylon, has recently\r\npublished, in one of the local periodicals, a series of papers on the\r\nColeoptera of the island, in which every species introduced is stated to\r\nbe previously undescribed.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Nat. Journal_, p. 39.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Republished in the _Ann. Nat. Hist._]\r\n\r\nCOLEOPTERA.--_Buprestidæ; Golden Beetles_.--In the morning the\r\nherbaceous plants, especially on the eastern side of the island, are\r\nstudded with these gorgeous beetles, whose golden wing-cases[1] are used\r\nto enrich the embroidery of the Indian zenana, whilst the lustrous\r\njoints of the legs are strung on silken threads, and form necklaces and\r\nbracelets of singular brilliancy.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Sternocera Chrysis; S. sternicornis_.]\r\n\r\nThese exquisite colours are not confined to one order, and some of the\r\nElateridæ[1] and Lamellicorns exhibit hues of green and blue, that rival\r\nthe deepest tints of the emerald and sapphire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Of the family of _Elateridæ_, one of the finest is a\r\nSinghalese species, the _Campsosternus Templetonii_, of an exquisite\r\ngolden green colour, with blue reflections (described and figured by Mr.\r\nWESTWOOD in his _Cabinet of Oriental Entomology_, pl. 35, f. 1). In the\r\nsame work is figured another species of large size, also from Ceylon,\r\nthis is the _Alaus sordidus_.--WESTWOOD, l. c. pl. 35, f. 9.]\r\n\r\n_Scavenger Beetles_.--Scavenger beetles[1] are to be seen wherever the\r\npresence of putrescent and offensive matter affords opportunity for the\r\ndisplay of their repulsive but most curious instincts; fastening on it\r\nwith eagerness, severing it into lumps proportionate to their strength,\r\nand rolling it along in search of some place sufficiently soft in which\r\nto bury it, after having deposited their eggs in the centre. I had\r\nfrequent opportunities, especially in traversing the sandy jungles in\r\nthe level plains to the north of the island, of observing the unfailing\r\nappearance of these creatures instantly on the dropping of horse dung,\r\nor any other substance suitable for their purpose; although not one was\r\nvisible but a moment before. Their approach on the wing is announced by\r\na loud and joyous booming sound, as they dash in rapid circles in search\r\nof the desired object, led by their sense of smell, and evidently little\r\nassisted by the eye in shaping their course towards it. In these\r\nexcursions they exhibit a strength of wing and sustained power of\r\nflight, such as is possessed by no other class of beetles with which I\r\nam acquainted, but which is obviously indispensable for the due\r\nperformance of the useful functions they discharge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ateuchus sacer; Copris sagax; C. capucinus_, &c. &c.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONGHORN BEETLE (BATEROCERA RUBUS).]\r\n\r\n_The Coco-nut Beetle_.--In the luxuriant forests of Ceylon the extensive\r\nfamily of _Longicorns_[1] and _Passalidæ_ live in destructive abundance.\r\nTo the coco-nut planters the ravages committed by beetles are painfully\r\nfamiliar.[2] The larva of one species of _Dynastida_, the _Oryctes\r\nrhinoceros_, called by the Singhalese \"_Gascooroominiya_,\" makes its way\r\ninto the younger trees, descending from the top, and after perforating\r\nthem in all directions, forms a cocoon of the gnawed wood and sawdust,\r\nin which it reposes during its sleep as a pupa, till the arrival of the\r\nperiod when it emerges as a perfect beetle. Notwithstanding the\r\nrepulsive aspect of the large pulpy larvæ of these beetles, they are\r\nesteemed a luxury by the Malabar coolies, who so far avail themselves of\r\nthe privilege accorded by the Levitical law, which permitted the Hebrews\r\nto eat \"the beetle after his kind.\"[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The engraving on the preceding page represents in its\r\nvarious transformations one of the most familiar and graceful of the\r\nlongicorn beetles of Ceylon, the _Batocera rubus_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: There is a paper in the _Journ. of the Asiat. Society of\r\nCeylon_, May, 1845, by Mr. CAPPER, on the ravages perpetrated by these\r\nbeetles. The writer had recently passed through several coco-nut\r\nplantations, \"varying in extent from 20 to 150 acres, and about two to\r\nthree years old: and in these he did not discover a single young tree\r\nuntouched by the cooroominiya.\"--P. 49.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Leviticus, xi. 22.]\r\n\r\nAmongst the superstitions of the Singhalese arising out of their belief\r\nin demonology, one remarkable one is connected with the appearance of a\r\nbeetle when observed on the floor of a dwelling-house after nightfall.\r\nThe popular belief is that in obedience to a certain form of incantation\r\n(called _cooroominiya-pilli_) a demon in the shape of a beetle is sent\r\nto the house of some person or family whose destruction it is intended\r\nto compass, and who presently falls sick and dies. The only means of\r\naverting this catastrophe is, that some one, himself an adept in\r\nnecromancy, should perform a counter-charm, the effect of which is to\r\nsend back the disguised beetle to destroy his original employer; for in\r\nsuch a conjuncture the death of one or the other is essential to appease\r\nthe demon whose intervention has been invoked. Hence the discomfort of a\r\nSinghalese on finding a beetle in his house after sunset, and his\r\nanxiety to expel but not to kill it.\r\n\r\n_Tortoise Beetles_.--There is one family of insects, the members of\r\nwhich cannot fail to strike the traveller by their singular beauty, the\r\n_Cassididæ_ or tortoise beetles, in which the outer shell overlaps the\r\nbody, and the limbs are susceptible of being drawn entirely within it.\r\nThe rim is frequently of a different tint from the centre, and one\r\nspecies which I have seen is quite startling from the brilliancy of its\r\ncolouring, which gives it the appearance of a ruby enclosed in a frame\r\nof pearl; but this wonderful effect disappears immediately on the death\r\nof the insect.\r\n\r\nORTHOPTERA. _Leaf-insects_.--But in relation to the insects of Ceylon\r\nthe admiration of their colours is still less exciting than the\r\nastonishment created by the forms in which some of the families present\r\nthemselves; especially the \"soothsayers\" (_Mantidæ_) and \"walking\r\nleaves.\" The latter[1], exhibiting the most cunning of all nature's\r\ndevices for the preservation of her creatures, are found in the jungle\r\nin all varieties of hues, from the pale yellow of an opening bud to the\r\nrich green of the full-blown leaf, and the withered tint of decay. So\r\nperfect is the imitation of a leaf in structure and articulation, that\r\nthis amazing insect when at rest is almost undistinguishable from the\r\nfoliage around: not only are the wings modelled to resemble ribbed and\r\nfibrous follicles, but every joint of the legs is expanded into a broad\r\nplait like a half-opened leaflet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Phyllium siccifolium.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STICK INSECT AND MANTIS]\r\n\r\nIt rests on its abdomen, the legs serving to drag it slowly along, and\r\nthus the flatness of its attitude serves still further to add to the\r\nappearance of a leaf. One of the most marvellous incidents connected\r\nwith its organisation was exhibited by one which I kept under a glass\r\nshade on my table, it laid a quantity of eggs, that, in colour and\r\nshape, were not to be distinguished from _seeds_. They were brown, and\r\npentangular, with a short stem, and slightly punctured at the\r\nintersections.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe \"soothsayer,\" on the other hand (_Mantis superstitiosa._ Fab.[1]),\r\nlittle justifies by its propensities the appearance of gentleness, and\r\nthe attitudes of sanctity, which have obtained for it the title of the\r\n\"praying mantis.\" Its habits are carnivorous, and degenerate into\r\ncannibalism, as it preys on the weaker individuals of its own species.\r\nTwo which I enclosed in a box were both found dead a few hours after,\r\nliterally severed limb from limb in their encounter. The formation of\r\nthe foreleg enables the tibia to be so closed on the sharp edge of the\r\nthigh as to amputate any slender substance grasped within it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _M. aridifolia_ and _M. extensicollis_, as well as _Empusa\r\ngongylodes_, remarkable for the long leaf-like head, and dilatations on\r\nthe posterior thighs, are common in the island.]\r\n\r\n_The Stick-insect_.--The _Phasmidæ_ or spectres, another class of\r\northoptera, present as close a resemblance to small branches or leafless\r\ntwigs as their congeners do to green leaves. The wing-covers, where they\r\nexist, instead of being expanded, are applied so closely to the body as\r\nto detract nothing from its rounded form, and hence the name which they\r\nhave acquired of \"_walking-sticks_.\" Like the _Phyllium_, the _Phasma_\r\nlives exclusively on vegetables, and some attain the length of several\r\ninches.\r\n\r\nOf all the other tribes of the _Orthoptera_ Ceylon possesses many\r\nrepresentatives; in swarms of cockroaches, grasshoppers, locusts, and\r\ncrickets.\r\n\r\nNEUROPTERA. _Dragon-flies_.--Of the _Neuroptera_, some of the\r\ndragon-flies are pre-eminently beautiful; one species, with rich\r\nbrown-coloured spots upon its gauzy wings, is to be seen near every\r\npool.[1] Another[2], which dances above the mountain streams in Oovah,\r\nand amongst the hills descending towards Kandy, gleams in the sun as if\r\neach of its green enamelled wings had been sliced from an emerald.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Libellula pulchella_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Euphæa splendens_.]\r\n\r\n_The Ant-Lion._--Of the ant-lion, whose larvæ have earned a bad renown\r\nfrom their predaceous ingenuity, Ceylon has, at least, four species,\r\nwhich seem peculiar to the island.[1] This singular creature,\r\npreparatory to its pupal transformation, contrives to excavate a conical\r\npitfall in the dust to the depth of about an inch, in the bottom of\r\nwhich it conceals itself, exposing only its open mandibles above the\r\nsurface; and here every ant and soft-bodied insect which curiosity\r\ntempts to descend, or accident may precipitate into the trap, is\r\nruthlessly seized and devoured by its ambushed inhabitant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Palpares contrarius_, Walker; _Myrmeleon gravis_, Walker;\r\n_M. dirus_, Walker; _M. barbarus_, Walker.]\r\n\r\n_The White Ant_.--But of the insects of this order the most noted are\r\nthe _white ants_ or termites (which are ants only by a misnomer). They\r\nare, unfortunately, at once ubiquitous and innumerable in every spot\r\nwhere the climate is not too chilly, or the soil too sandy, for them to\r\nconstruct their domed edifices.\r\n\r\nThese they raise from a considerable depth under ground, excavating the\r\nclay with their mandibles, and moistening it with tenacious saliva[1]\r\nuntil it assume the appearance, and almost the consistency, of\r\nsandstone. So delicate is the trituration to which they subject this\r\nmaterial, that the goldsmiths of Ceylon employ the powdered clay of the\r\nant hills in preference to all other substances in the preparation of\r\ncrucibles and moulds for their finer castings: and KNOX says, \"the\r\npeople use this finer clay to make their earthen gods of, it is so pure\r\nand fine.\"[2] These structures the termites erect with such perseverance\r\nand durability that they frequently rise to the height of ten or twelve\r\nfeet from the ground, with a corresponding diameter. They are so firm in\r\ntheir texture that the weight of a horse makes no apparent indentation\r\non their solidity; and even the intense rains of the monsoon, which no\r\ncement or mortar can long resist, fail to penetrate the surface or\r\nsubstance of an ant hill.[3] In their earlier stages the termites\r\nproceed with such energetic rapidity, that I have seen a pinnacle of\r\nmoist clay, six inches in height and twice as large in diameter,\r\nconstructed underneath a table between sitting down to dinner and the\r\nremoval of the cloth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It becomes an interesting question whence the termites\r\nderive the large supplies of moisture with which they not only temper\r\nthe clay for the construction of their long covered ways above ground,\r\nbut for keeping their passages uniformly damp and cool below the\r\nsurface. Yet their habits in this particular are unvarying, in the\r\nseasons of droughts as well as after rain; in the driest and least\r\npromising positions, in situations inaccessible to drainage from above,\r\nand cut off by rocks and impervious strata from springs from below. Dr.\r\nLivingstone, struck with this phenomenon in Southern Africa, asks: \"Can\r\nthe white ants possess the power of combining the oxygen and hydrogen of\r\ntheir vegetable food by vital force so as to form water?\"--_Travels_, p.\r\n22. And he describes at Angola, an insect[A] resembling the _Aphrophora\r\nspumaria_; seven or eight individuals of which distil several pints of\r\nwater every night.--P. 414. It is highly probable that the termites are\r\nendowed with some such faculty: nor is it more remarkable that an insect\r\nshould combine the gases of its food to produce water, than that a fish\r\nshould decompose water in order to provide itself with gas. FOURCROIX\r\nfound the contents of the air-bladder in a carp to be pure\r\nnitrogen.--_Yarrell_, vol. i. p. 42. And the aquatic larva of the\r\ndragon-fly extracts air for its respiration from the water in which it\r\nis submerged. A similar mystery pervades the inquiry whence plants under\r\npeculiar circumstances derive the water essential to vegetation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: _A. goudotti?_ Bennett.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: KNOX'S _Ceylon_, Part i, ch. vi, p.24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Dr. HOOKER, in his _Himalayan Journal_ (vol. i. p. 20) is\r\nof opinion that the nests of the termites are not independent\r\nstructures, but that their nucleus is \"the debris of clumps of bamboos\r\nor the trunks of large trees which these insects have destroyed.\" He\r\nsupposes that the dead tree falls leaving the stump coated with sand,\r\n_which the action of the weather soon fashions into a cone_. But\r\nindependently of the fact that the \"action of the weather\" produces\r\nlittle or no effect on the closely cemented clay of the white ants'\r\nnest, they may be daily seen constructing their edifices in the very\r\nform of a cone, which they ever after retain. Besides which, they appear\r\nin the midst of terraces and fields where no trees are to be seen: and\r\nDr. Hooker seems to overlook the fact that the termites rarely attack a\r\nliving tree; and although their nests may be built against one, it\r\ncontinues to flourish not the less for their presence.]\r\n\r\nAs these lofty mounds of earth have all been carried up from beneath the\r\nsurface, a cave of corresponding dimensions is necessarily scooped out\r\nbelow, and here, under the multitude of miniature cupolas and pinnacles\r\nwhich canopy it above, the termites hollow out the royal chamber for\r\ntheir queen, with spacious nurseries surrounding it on all sides; and\r\nall are connected by arched galleries, long passages, and doorways of\r\nthe most intricate and elaborate construction. In the centre and\r\nunderneath the spacious dome is the recess for the queen--a hideous\r\ncreature, with the head and thorax of an ordinary termite, but a body\r\nswollen to a hundred times its usual and proportionate bulk, and\r\npresenting the appearance of a mass of shapeless pulp. From this great\r\nprogenitrix proceed the myriads that people the subterranean hive,\r\nconsisting, like the communities of the genuine ants, of labourers and\r\nsoldiers, which are destined never to acquire a fuller development than\r\nthat of larvæ, and the perfect insects which in due time become invested\r\nwith wings and take their departing flight from the cave. But their new\r\nequipment seems only destined to facilitate their dispersion from the\r\nparent nest, which takes place at dusk; and almost as quickly as they\r\nleave it they divest themselves of their ineffectual wings, waving them\r\nimpatiently and twisting them in every direction till they become\r\ndetached and drop off, and the swarm, within a few hours of their\r\nemancipation, become a prey to the night-jars and bats, which are\r\ninstantly attracted to them as they issue in a cloud from the ground. I\r\nam not prepared to say that the other insectivorous birds would not\r\ngladly make a meal of the termites, but, seeing that in Ceylon their\r\nnumbers are chiefly kept in check by the crepuscular birds, it is\r\nobservable, at least as a coincidence, that the dispersion of the swarm\r\ngenerally takes place at _twilight_. Those that escape the _caprimulgi_\r\nfall a prey to the crows, on the morning succeeding their flight.\r\n\r\nThe strange peculiarity of the omnivorous ravages of the white ants is\r\nthat they shrink from the light; in all their expeditions for providing\r\nfood they construct a covered pathway of moistened clay, and their\r\ngalleries above ground extend to an incredible distance from the central\r\nnest. No timber, except ebony and ironwood, which are too hard, and\r\nthose which are strongly impregnated with camphor or aromatic oils,\r\nwhich they dislike, presents any obstacle to their ingress. I have had a\r\ncase of wine filled, in the course of two days, with almost solid clay,\r\nand only discovered the presence of the white ants by the escape from\r\nthe corks. I have had a portmanteau in my tent so peopled with them in\r\nthe course of a single night that the contents were found worthless in\r\nthe morning. In an incredibly short time a detachment of these pests\r\nwill destroy a press full of records, reducing the paper to fragments;\r\nand a shelf of books will be tunnelled into a gallery if it happen to be\r\nin their line of march. The timbers of a house when fairly attacked are\r\neaten from within till the beams are reduced to an absolute shell, so\r\nthin that it may be punched through with the point of the finger: and\r\neven kyanized wood, unless impregnated with an extra quantity of\r\ncorrosive sublimate, appears to occasion them no inconvenience. The only\r\neffectual precaution for the protection of furniture is incessant\r\nvigilance--the constant watching of every article, and its daily removal\r\nfrom place to place, in order to baffle their assaults.\r\n\r\nThey do not appear in the hills above the elevation of 4000 or 5000\r\nfeet. One species of white ant, the _Termes Taprobanes_, was at one time\r\nbelieved by Mr. Walker to be peculiar to the island, but it has recently\r\nbeen found in Sumatra and Borneo, and in some parts of Hindustan.\r\n\r\nThere is a species of Termes in Ceylon (_T. monoceros_), which always\r\nbuilds its nest in the hollow of an old tree; and, unlike the others,\r\ncarries on its labours without the secrecy and protection of a covered\r\nway. A marching column of these creatures may be observed at early\r\nmorning in the vicinity of their nest, returning laden with the spoils\r\ncollected during their foraging excursions. These consist of comminuted\r\nvegetable matter, derived, it may be, from a thatched roof, if one\r\nhappens to be within reach, or from the decaying leaves of a coco-nut.\r\nEach little worker in the column carries its tiny load in its jaws; and\r\nthe number of individuals in one of these lines of march must be\r\nimmense, for the column is generally about two inches in width, and very\r\ndensely crowded. One was measured which had most likely been in motion\r\nfor hours, moving in the direction of the nest, and was found to be\r\nupwards of sixty paces in length. If attention be directed to the mass\r\nin motion, it will be observed that flanking it on each side throughout\r\nits whole length are stationed a number of horned soldier termites,\r\nwhose duty it is to protect the labourers, and to give notice of any\r\ndanger threatening them. This latter duty they perform by a peculiar\r\nquivering motion of the whole body, which is rapidly communicated from\r\none to the other for a considerable distance: a portion of the column is\r\nthen thrown into confusion for a short time, but confidence soon\r\nreturns, and the progress of the little creatures goes on with\r\nsteadiness and order as before. The nest is of a black colour, and\r\nresembles a mass of scoriæ; the insects themselves are of a pitchy\r\nbrown.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For these particulars of the _termes monoceros_, I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Thwaites, of the Roy. Botanic Garden at Kandy.]\r\n\r\nHYMENOPTERA. _Mason Wasp_.--In Ceylon as in all other countries, the\r\norder of hymenopterous insects arrests us less by the beauty of their\r\nforms than the marvels of their sagacity and the achievements of their\r\ninstinct. A fossorial wasp of the family of _Sphegidæ_,[1] which is\r\ndistinguished by its metallic lustre, enters by the open windows, and\r\nconverts irritation at its movements into admiration of the graceful\r\nindustry with which it stops up the keyholes and similar apertures with\r\nclay in order to build in them a cell. Into this it thrusts the pupa of\r\nsome other insect, within whose body it has previously introduced its\r\nown eggs. The whole is surrounded with moistened earth, through which\r\nthe young parasite, after undergoing its transformations, gnaws its way\r\ninto light, to emerge as a four-winged fly.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It belongs to the genus _Pelopæus, P. Spinolæ_, of St.\r\nFargean. The _Ampulex compressa_, which drags about the larvæ of\r\ncockroaches into which it has implanted its eggs, belongs, to the same\r\nfamily.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Mr. E.L. Layard has given an interesting account of this\r\nMason wasp in the _Annals and Magazine of Nat. History_ for May, 1853.\r\n\"I have frequently,\" he says, \"selected one of these flies for\r\nobservation, and have seen their labours extend over a period of a\r\nfortnight or twenty days; sometimes only half a cell was completed in a\r\nday, at others as much as two. I never saw more than twenty cells in one\r\nnest, seldom indeed that number, and whence the caterpillars were\r\nprocured was always to me a mystery. I have seen thirty or forty brought\r\nin of a species which I knew to be very rare in the perfect state, and\r\nwhich I had sought for in vain, although I knew on what plant they fed.\r\n\r\n\"Then again how are they disabled by the wasp, and yet not injured so as\r\nto cause their immediate death? Die they all do, at least all that I\r\nhave ever tried to rear, after taking them from the nest.\r\n\r\n\"The perfected fly never effects its egress from the closed aperture,\r\nthrough which the caterpillars were inserted, and when cells are placed\r\nend to end, as they are in many instances, the outward end of each is\r\nalways selected. I cannot detect any difference in the thickness in the\r\ncrust of the cell to cause this uniformity of practice. It is often as\r\nmuch as half an inch through, of great hardness, and as far as I can see\r\nimpervious to air and light. How then does the enclosed fly always\r\nselect the right end, and with what secretion is it supplied to\r\ndecompose this mortar?\"]\r\n\r\nA formidable species (_Sphex ferruginea_ of St. Fargeau), which is\r\ncommon to India and most of the eastern islands, is regarded with the\r\nutmost dread by the unclad natives, who fly precipitately on finding\r\nthemselves in the vicinity[1] of its nests. These are of such ample\r\ndimensions, that when suspended from a branch, they often measure\r\nupwards of six feet in length.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It ought to be remembered in travelling in the forests of\r\nCeylon that sal volatile applied immediately is a specific for the sting\r\nof a wasp.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: At the January (1839) meeting of the Entomological Society,\r\nMr. Whitehouse exhibited portions of a wasps' nest from Ceylon, between\r\nseven and eight feet long and two feet in diameter, and showed that the\r\nconstruction of the cells was perfectly analogous to those of the hive\r\nbee, and that when connected each has a tendency to assume a circular\r\noutline. In one specimen where there were three cells united the outer\r\npart was circular, whilst the portions common to the three formed\r\nstraight walls. From this Singhalese nest Mr. Whitehouse demonstrated\r\nthat the wasps at the commencement of their comb proceed slowly, forming\r\nthe bases of several together, whereby they assume the hexagonal shape,\r\nwhereas, if constructed separately, he thought each single cell would be\r\ncircular. See _Proc. Ent. Soc._, vol. iii. p. 16.]\r\n\r\n_Bees._--Bees of several species and genera, some unprovided with\r\nstings, and some in size scarcely exceeding a house-fly, deposit their\r\nhoney in hollow trees, or suspend their combs from a branch. The spoils\r\nof their industry form one of the chief resources of the uncivilised\r\nVeddahs, who collect the wax in the upland forests, to be bartered for\r\narrow points and clothes in the lowlands.[1] I have never heard of an\r\ninstance of persons being attacked by the bees of Ceylon, and hence the\r\nnatives assert, that those most productive of honey are destitute of\r\nstings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A gentleman connected with the department of the\r\nSurveyor-General writes to me that he measured a honey-comb which he\r\nfound fastened to the overhanging branch of a small tree in the forest\r\nnear Adam's Peak, and found it nine links of his chain or about six feet\r\nin length and a foot in breadth where it was attached to the branch, but\r\ntapering towards the other extremity. \"It was a single comb with a layer\r\nof cells on either side, but so weighty that the branch broke by the\r\nstrain.\"]\r\n\r\n_The Carpenter Bee._--The operations of one of the most interesting of\r\nthe tribe, the Carpenter bee[1], I have watched with admiration from the\r\nwindow of the Colonial Secretary's official residence at Kandy. So soon\r\nas the day grew warm, these active creatures were at work perforating\r\nthe wooden columns which supported the verandah. They poised themselves\r\non their shining purple wings, as they made the first lodgment in the\r\nwood, enlivening the work with an uninterrupted hum of delight, which\r\nwas audible to a considerable distance. When the excavation had\r\nproceeded so far that the insect could descend into it, the music was\r\nsuspended, but renewed from time to time, as the little creature came to\r\nthe orifice to throw out the chips, to rest, or to enjoy the fresh air.\r\nBy degrees, a mound of saw-dust was formed at the base of the pillar,\r\nconsisting of particles abraded by the mandibles of the bee. These, when\r\nthe hollow was completed to the depth of several inches, were partially\r\nreplaced in the excavation after being agglutinated to form partitions\r\nbetween the eggs, as they were deposited within. The mandibles[2] of\r\nthese bees are admirably formed for the purpose of working out the\r\ntunnels required, being short, stout, and usually furnished at the tip\r\nwith two teeth which are rounded somewhat into the form of\r\ncheese-cutters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Xylocopa tenuiscapa_, Westw.; Another species found in\r\nCeylon is the _X. latipes_, Drury.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See figure above.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CARPENTER BEE]\r\n\r\nThese when brought into operation cut out the wood in the same way as a\r\ncarpenter's double gouge, the teeth being more or less hollowed out\r\nwithin. The female alone is furnished with these powerful instruments.\r\nIn the males the mandibles are slender as compared with those of the\r\nfemales. The bores of some of these bees are described as being from\r\ntwelve to fourteen inches in length.\r\n\r\n_Ants_.--As to ants, I apprehend that, notwithstanding their numbers and\r\nfamiliarity, information is very imperfect relative to the varieties and\r\nhabits of these marvellous insects in Ceylon.[1] In point of multitude\r\nit is scarcely an exaggeration to apply to them the figure of \"the sands\r\nof the sea.\" They are everywhere; in the earth, in the houses, and on\r\nthe trees; they are to be seen in every room and cupboard, and almost on\r\nevery plant in the jungle. To some of the latter they are, perhaps,\r\nattracted by the sweet juices secreted by the aphides and coccidæ.[2]\r\nSuch is the passion of the ants for sugar, and their wonderful faculty\r\nof discovering it, that the smallest particle of a substance containing\r\nit is quickly covered with them, though placed in the least conspicuous\r\nposition, where not a single one may have been visible a moment before.\r\nBut it is not sweet substances alone that they attack; no animal or\r\nvegetable matter comes amiss to them: no aperture appears too small to\r\nadmit them; it is necessary to place everything which it may be\r\ndesirable to keep free from their invasion, under the closest cover, or\r\non tables with cups of water under every foot. As scavengers, they are\r\ninvaluable; and as ants never sleep, but work without cessation during\r\nthe night as well as by day, every particle of decaying vegetable or\r\nputrid animal matter is removed with inconceiveable speed and certainty.\r\nIn collecting shells, I have been able to turn this propensity to good\r\naccount; by placing them within their reach, the ants in a few days\r\nremoved every vestige of the mollusc from the innermost and otherwise\r\ninaccessible whorls; thus avoiding all risk of injuring the enamel by\r\nany mechanical process.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Jerdan, in a series of papers in the thirteenth volume\r\nof the _Annals of Natural History_, has described forty-seven species of\r\nants in Southern India. But M. Nietner has recently forwarded to the\r\nBerlin Museum upwards of seventy species taken by him in Ceylon, chiefly\r\nin the western province and the vicinity of Colombo. Of these many are\r\nidentical with those noted by Mr. Jerdan as belonging to the Indian\r\ncontinent. One (probably _Drepanognathus saltator_ of Jerdan) is\r\ndescribed by M. Nietner as occasionally \"moving by jumps of several\r\ninches at a spring.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Dr. DAVY, in a paper on Tropical Plants, has introduced the\r\nfollowing passage relative to the purification of sugar by ants:\r\n\r\n\"If the juice of the sugar-cane--the common syrup as expressed by the\r\nmill--be exposed to the air, it gradually evaporates, yielding a\r\nlight-brown residue, like the ordinary muscovado sugar of the best\r\nquality. If not protected, it is presently attacked by ants, and in a\r\nshort time is, as it were, converted into white crystalline sugar, the\r\nants having refined it by removing the darker portion, probably\r\npreferring that part from it containing azotized matter. The negroes, I\r\nmay remark, prefer brown sugar to white: they say its sweetening power\r\nis greater; no doubt its nourishing quality is greater, and therefore as\r\nan article of diet deserving of preference. In refining sugar as in\r\nrefining salt (coarse bay salt containing a little iodine), an error may\r\nbe committed in abstracting matter designed by nature for a useful\r\npurpose.\"]\r\n\r\nBut the assaults of the ants are not confined to dead animals alone,\r\nthey attack equally such small insects as they can overcome, or find\r\ndisabled by accidents or wounds; and it is not unusual to see some\r\nhundreds of them surrounding a maimed beetle, or a bruised cockroach,\r\nand hurrying it along in spite of its struggles. I have, on more than\r\none occasion, seen a contest between, them and one of the viscous\r\nophidians, _Cæcilia, glutinosa_[1], a reptile resembling an enormous\r\nearthworm, common in the Kandyan hills, of an inch in diameter, and\r\nnearly two feet in length. On these occasions it would seem as if the\r\nwhole community had been summoned and turned out for such a prodigious\r\neffort; they surround their victim literally in tens of thousands,\r\ninflicting wounds on all parts, and forcing it along towards their nest\r\nin spite of resistance. In one instance to which I was a witness, the\r\nconflict lasted for the latter part of a day, but towards evening the\r\nCoecilia was completely exhausted, and in the morning it had totally\r\ndisappeared, having been carried away either whole or piecemeal by its\r\nassailants.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _ante_, p. 317.]\r\n\r\nThe species I here allude to is a very small ant, which the Singhalese\r\ncall by the generic name of _Koombiya_. There is a species still more\r\nminute, and evidently distinct, which frequents the caraffes and toilet\r\nvessels. A third, probably the _Formica nidificans_ of Jerdan, is black,\r\nof the same size as that last mentioned, and, from its colour, called\r\nthe _Kalu koombiga_ by the natives. In the houses its propensities and\r\nhabits are the same as those of the others; but I have observed that it\r\nfrequents the trees more profusely, forming small paper cells for its\r\nyoung, like miniature wasps' nests, in which it deposits its eggs,\r\nsuspending them from a twig.\r\n\r\nThe most formidable of all is the great red ant or Dimiya.[1] It is\r\nparticularly abundant in gardens, and on fruit trees; it constructs its\r\ndwellings by glueing the leaves of such species as are suitable from\r\ntheir shape and pliancy into hollow balls, and these it lines with a\r\nkind of transparent paper, like that manufactured by the wasp. I have\r\nwatched them at the interesting operation of forming these dwellings;--a\r\nline of ants standing on the edge of one leaf bring another into contact\r\nwith it, and hold both together with their mandibles till their\r\ncompanions within attach them firmly by means of their adhesive paper,\r\nthe assistants outside moving along as the work proceeds. If it be\r\nnecessary to draw closer a leaf too distant to be laid hold of by the\r\nimmediate workers, they form a chain by depending one from the other\r\ntill the object is reached, when it is at length brought into contact,\r\nand made fast by cement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Formica smaragdina,_ Fab.]\r\n\r\nLike all their race, these ants are in perpetual motion, forming lines\r\non the ground along which they pass, in continual procession to and from\r\nthe trees on which they reside. They are the most irritable of the whole\r\norder in Ceylon, biting with such intense ferocity as to render it\r\ndifficult for the unclad natives to collect the fruit from the mango\r\ntrees, which the red ants especially frequent. They drop from the\r\nbranches upon travellers in the jungle, attacking them with venom and\r\nfury, and inflicting intolerable pain both upon animals and man. On\r\nexamining the structure of the head through a microscope, I found that\r\nthe mandibles, instead of merely meeting in contact, are so hooked as to\r\ncross each other at the points, whilst the inner line is sharply\r\nserrated throughout its entire length; thus occasioning the intense pain\r\nof their bite, as compared with that of the ordinary ant.\r\n\r\nTo check the ravages of the coffee bug[1] (_Lecanium coffeæ_, Walker),\r\nwhich for some years past has devastated some of the plantations in\r\nCeylon, the experiment was made of introducing the red ants, who feed\r\ngreedily on the Coccus. But the remedy threatened to be attended with\r\nsome inconvenience, for the Malabar Coolies, with bare and oiled skins,\r\nwere so frequently and fiercely assaulted by the ants as to endanger\r\ntheir stay on the estates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an account of this pest, see p. 437.]\r\n\r\nThe ants which burrow in the ground in Ceylon are generally, but not\r\ninvariably, black, and some of them are of considerable size. One\r\nspecies, about the third of an inch in length, is abundant in the hills,\r\nand especially about the roots of trees, where they pile up the earth in\r\ncircular heaps round the entrance to their nests, and in doing this I\r\nhave observed a singular illustration of their instinct. To carry up\r\neach particle of sand by itself would be an endless waste of labour, and\r\nto carry two or more loose ones securely would be to them embarrassing,\r\nif not impossible. To overcome the difficulty they glue together with\r\ntheir saliva so much earth or sand as is sufficient for a burden, and\r\neach ant may be seen hurrying up from below with his load, carrying it\r\nto the top of the circular heap outside, and throwing it over, the mass\r\nbeing so strongly attached as to roll to the bottom without breaking\r\nasunder.\r\n\r\nThe ants I have been here describing are inoffensive, differing in this\r\nparticular from the Dimiya and another of similar size and ferocity,\r\nwhich is called by the Singhalese _Kaddiya_. They have a legend\r\nillustrative of their alarm for the bites of the latter, to the effect\r\nthat the cobra de capello invested the Kaddiya with her own venom in\r\nadmiration of the singular courage displayed by these little\r\ncreatures.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: KNOX'S _Historical Relation of Ceylon_, pt. i. ch. vi. p.\r\n23.]\r\n\r\nLEPIDOPTERA. _Butterflies_.--In the interior of the island butterflies\r\nare comparatively rare, and, contrary to the ordinary belief, they are\r\nseldom to be seen in the sunshine. They frequent the neighbourhood of\r\nthe jungle, and especially the vicinity of the rivers and waterfalls,\r\nliving mainly in the shade of the moist foliage, and returning to it in\r\nhaste after the shortest flights, as if their slender bodies were\r\nspeedily dried up and exhausted by exposure to the intense heat.\r\n\r\nAmong the largest and most gaudy of the Ceylon Lepidoptera is the great\r\nblack and yellow butterfly (_Ornithoptera darsius_, Gray); the upper\r\nwings of which measure six inches across, and are of deep velvet black,\r\nthe lower ornamented by large particles of satiny yellow, through which\r\nthe sunlight passes. Few insects can compare with it in beauty, as it\r\nhovers over the flowers of the heliotrope, which furnish the favourite\r\nfood of the perfect fly, although the caterpillar feeds on the\r\naristolochia and the _betel leaf_, and suspends its chrysalis from its\r\ndrooping tendrils.\r\n\r\nNext in size as to expanse of wing, though often exceeding it in\r\nbreadth, is the black and blue _Papilio Polymnestor_, which darts\r\nrapidly through the air, alighting on the ruddy flowers of the hibiscus,\r\nor the dark green foliage of the citrus, on which it deposits its eggs.\r\nThe larvæ of this species are green with white bands, and have a hump on\r\nthe fourth or fifth segment. From this hump the caterpillar, on being\r\nirritated, protrudes a singular horn of an orange colour, bifurcate at\r\nthe extremity, and covered with a pungent mucilaginous secretion. This\r\nis evidently intended as a weapon of defence against the attack of the\r\nichneumon flies, that deposit their eggs in its soft body, for when the\r\ngrub is pricked, either by the ovipositor of the ichneumon, or by any\r\nother sharp instrument, the horn is at once protruded, and struck upon\r\nthe offending object with unerring aim.\r\n\r\nAmongst the more common of the larger butterflies is the _P. Hector_,\r\nwith gorgeous crimson spots set in the black velvet of the inferior\r\nwings; these, when fresh, are shot with a purple blush, equalling in\r\nsplendour the azure of the European \"_Emperor._\"\r\n\r\n_The Spectre Butterfly._--Another butterfly, but belonging to a widely\r\ndifferent group, is the \"sylph\" (_Hestia Jasonia_), called by the\r\nEuropeans by the various names of _Floater, Spectre_, and _Silver-paper\r\nfly_, as indicative of its graceful flight. It is found only in the deep\r\nshade of the damp forest, usually frequenting the vicinity of pools of\r\nwater and cascades, about which it sails heedless of the spray, the\r\nmoisture of which may even be beneficial in preserving the elasticity of\r\nits thin and delicate wings, that bend and undulate in the act of\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nThe _Lycanidæ_[1], a particularly attractive group, abound near the\r\nenclosures of cultivated grounds, and amongst the low shrubs edging the\r\npatenas, flitting from flower to flower, inspecting each in turn, as if\r\nattracted by their beauty, in the full blaze of sun-light; and shunning\r\nexposure less sedulously than the other diurnals. Some of the more\r\nrobust kinds[2] are magnificent in the bright light, from the splendour\r\nof their metallic blues and glowing purples, but they yield in elegance\r\nof form and variety to their tinier and more delicately-coloured\r\ncongeners.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Lycæna polyommatus, &c._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Amblypodia pseudocentaurus, &c._]\r\n\r\nShort as is the eastern twilight, it has its own peculiar forms, and the\r\nnaturalist marks with interest the small, but strong, _Hesperidæ_[1],\r\nhurrying, by abrupt and jerking flights, to the scented blossoms of the\r\nchampac or the sweet night-blowing moon-flower; and, when darkness\r\ngathers around, we can hear, though hardly distinguish amid the gloom,\r\nthe humming of the powerful wings of innumerable hawk moths, which hover\r\nwith their long proboscides inserted into the starry petals of the\r\nperiwinkle.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Pamphila hesperia, &c._]\r\n\r\nConspicuous amidst these nocturnal moths is the richly-coloured\r\n_Acherontia Satanas_, one of the Singhalese representatives of our\r\nDeath's-head moth, which utters a sharp and stridulous cry when seized.\r\nThis sound has been conjectured to be produced by the friction of its\r\nthorax against the abdomen;--Reaumur believed it to be caused by the\r\nrubbing of the palpi against the tongue. I have never been able to\r\nobserve either motion, and Mr. E.L. Layard is of opinion that the sound\r\nis emitted from two apertures concealed by tufts of wiry bristles thrown\r\nout from each side of the inferior portion of the thorax.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is another variety of the same moth in Ceylon which\r\nclosely resembles it in its markings, but in which I have never detected\r\nthe uttering of this curious cry. It is smaller than the _A. Satanas_,\r\nand, like it, often enters dwellings at night, attracted by the lights;\r\nbut I have not found its larvæ, although that of the other species is\r\ncommon on several widely different plants.]\r\n\r\n_Moths._--Among the strictly nocturnal _Lepidoptera_ are some gigantic\r\nspecies. Of these the cinnamon-eating _Atlas_, often attains the\r\ndimensions of nearly a foot in the stretch of its superior wings. It is\r\nvery common in the gardens about Colombo, and its size, and the\r\ntransparent talc-like spots in its wings, cannot fail to strike even the\r\nmost careless saunterer. But little inferior to it in size is the famed\r\nTusseh silk moth[1], which feeds on the country almond (_Terminalia\r\ncatappa_) and the palma Christi or Castor-oil plant; it is easily\r\ndistinguishable from the Atlas, which has a triangular wing, whilst its\r\nis falcated, and the transparent spots are covered with a curious\r\nthread-like division drawn across them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Antheræa mylitta,_ Drury.]\r\n\r\nTowards the northern portions of the island this valuable species\r\nentirely displaces the other, owing to the fact that the almond and\r\n_palma Christi_ abound there. The latter plant springs up spontaneously\r\non every manure-heap or neglected spot of ground; and might be\r\ncultivated, as in India, with great advantage, the leaf to be used as\r\nfood for the caterpillar, the stalk as fodder for cattle, and the seed\r\nfor the expression of castor-oil. The Dutch took advantage of this\r\nfacility, and gave every encouragement to the cultivation of silk at\r\nJaffna[1], but it never attained such a development as to become an\r\narticle of commercial importance. Ceylon now cultivates no silkworms\r\nwhatever, notwithstanding this abundance of the favourite food of one\r\nspecies; and the rich silken robes sometimes worn by the Buddhist\r\npriesthood are imported from China and the continent of India.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Portuguese had made the attempt previous to the arrival\r\nof the Dutch, and a strip of land on the banks of the Kalany river near\r\nColombo, still bears the name of Orta Seda, the silk garden. The attempt\r\nof the Dutch to introduce the true silkworm, the _Bombyx mori_, took\r\nplace under the governorship; of Ryklof Van Goens, who, on handing over\r\nthe administration to his successor in A.D. 1663, thus apprises him of\r\nthe initiation of the experiment:--\"At Jaffna Palace a trial has been\r\nundertaken to feed silkworms, and to ascertain whether silk may be\r\nreared at that station. I have planted a quantity of mulberry trees,\r\nwhich grow well there, and they ought to be planted in other\r\ndirections.\"--VALENTYN, chap. xiii. The growth of the mulberry trees is\r\nnoticed the year after in a report to the governor-general of India, but\r\nthe subject afterwards ceased to be attended to.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Atlas moth and the Mylitta, there are many other\r\n_Bombycidæ_; in Ceylon; and, though the silk of some of them, were it\r\nsusceptible of being unwound from the cocoon, would not bear a\r\ncomparison with that of the _Bombyx mori_, or even of the Tusseh moth,\r\nit might still prove to be valuable when carded and spun. If the\r\nEuropean residents in the colony would rear the larvæ of these\r\nLepidoptera, and make drawings of their various changes, they would\r\nrender a possible service to commerce, and a certain one to\r\nentomological knowledge.\r\n\r\n_Stinging Caterpillars_.--The Dutch carried to their Eastern settlements\r\ntwo of their home propensities, which distinguish and embellish the\r\ntowns of the Low Countries; they indulged in the excavation of canals,\r\nand they planted long lines of trees to diffuse shade over the sultry\r\npassages in their Indian fortresses. For the latter purpose they\r\nemployed the Suriya (_Hibiscus populneus_), whose broad umbrageous\r\nleaves and delicate yellow flowers impart a delicious coolness, and give\r\nto the streets of Galle and Colombo the fresh and enlivening aspect of\r\nwalks in a garden.\r\n\r\nIn the towns, however, the suriya trees are productive of one serious\r\ninconvenience. They are the resort of a hairy greenish caterpillar[1],\r\nlongitudinally striped, great numbers of which frequent them, and at a\r\ncertain stage of growth descend by a silken thread to the ground and\r\nhurry away, probably in search of a suitable spot in which to pass\r\nthrough their metamorphoses. Should they happen to alight, as they often\r\ndo, upon some lounger below, and find their way to his unprotected skin,\r\nthey inflict, if molested, a sting as pungent, but far more lasting,\r\nthan that of a nettle or a star-fish.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The species of moth with which it is identified has not yet\r\nbeen determined, but it most probably belongs to a section of\r\nBoisduval's genus _Bombyx_ allied to _Cnethocampa_, Stephens.]\r\n\r\nAttention being thus directed to the quarter whence an assailant has\r\nlowered himself down, the caterpillars above will be found in clusters,\r\nsometimes amounting to hundreds, clinging to the branches and the bark,\r\nwith a few straggling over the leaves or suspended from them by lines.\r\nThese pests are so annoying to children as well as destructive to the\r\nfoliage, that it is often necessary to singe them off the trees by a\r\nflambeau fixed on the extremity of a pole; and as they fall to the\r\nground they are eagerly devoured by the crows and domestic fowls.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Another caterpillar which feeds on the jasmine flowering\r\nCarissa, stings with such fury that I have known a gentleman to shed\r\ntears while the pain was at its height. It is short and broad, of a pale\r\ngreen, with fleshy spines on the upper surface, each of which seems to\r\nbe charged with the venom that occasions this acute suffering. The moth\r\nwhich this caterpillar produces, _Neæra lepida_, Cramer; _Limacodes\r\ngraciosa_, Westw., has dark brown wings, the primary traversed by a\r\nbroad green band. It is common in the western side of Ceylon. The larvæ\r\nof the genus _Adolia_ are also hairy, and sting with virulence.]\r\n\r\n_The Wood-carrying Moth_.--There is another family of insects, the\r\nsingular habits of which will not fail to attract the traveller in the\r\ncultivated tracts of Ceylon--these are moths of the genus\r\n_Oiketicus_[1], of which the females are devoid of wings, and some\r\npossess no articulated feet. Their larvæ construct for themselves cases,\r\nwhich they suspend to a branch frequently of the pomegranate[2],\r\nsurrounding them with the stems of leaves, and thorns or pieces of twigs\r\nbound together by threads, till the whole presents the appearance of a\r\nbundle of rods about an inch and a half long; and, from the resemblance\r\nof this to a Roman fasces, one African species has obtained the name of\r\n\"Lictor.\" The German entomologists denominated the group _Sackträger_,\r\nthe Singhalese call them _Dara-kattea_ or \"billets of firewood,\" and\r\nregard the inmates as human beings, who, as a punishment for stealing\r\nwood in some former state of existence, have been condemned to undergo a\r\nmetempsychosis under the form of these insects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Eumeta_, Wlk.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The singular instincts of a species of Thecla, _Dipsas\r\nIsocrates_, Fab., in connection with the fruit of the pomegranate, were\r\nfully described by Mr. Westwood, in a paper read before the\r\nEntomological Society of London in 1835.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WOOD-CARRYING MOTH.]\r\n\r\nThe male, at the close of the pupal rest, escapes from one end of this\r\nsingular covering, but the female makes it her dwelling for life; moving\r\nabout with it at pleasure, and entrenching herself within it, when\r\nalarmed, by drawing together the purse-like aperture at the open end. Of\r\nthese remarkable creatures there are five ascertained species in Ceylon:\r\n_Psyche Doubledaii_, Westw.; _Metisa plana_; Walker; _Eumeta Cramerii_,\r\nWestw.; _E. Templetonii_, Westw.; and _Cryptothelea consorta_, Temp.\r\n\r\nAll the other tribes of minute _Lepitoptera_ have abundant\r\nrepresentatives in Ceylon; some of them most attractive from the great\r\nbeauty of their markings and colouring. The curious little split-winged\r\nmoth (_Pterophorus_) is frequently seen in the cinnamon gardens and in\r\nthe vicinity of the fort, hid from the noon-day heat among the cool\r\ngrass shaded by the coco-nut topes. Three species have been captured,\r\nall characterised by the same singular feature of having the wings\r\nfan-like, separated nearly their entire length into detached sections,\r\nresembling feathers in the pinions of a bird expanded for flight.\r\n\r\nHOMOPTERA. _Cicada._--Of the _Homoptera_, the one which will most\r\nfrequently arrest attention is the cicada, which, resting high up on the\r\nbark of a tree, makes the forest re-echo with a long-sustained noise so\r\ncuriously resembling that of a cutler's wheel that the creature\r\nproducing it has acquired the highly-appropriate name of the\r\n\"knife-grinder.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CICADA--\"THE KNIFE GRINDER.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the jungle which adjoined the grounds attached to my official\r\nresidence at Kandy, the shrubs were frequented by an insect covered\r\nprofusely with a snow-white powder, arranged in delicate filaments that\r\ncurl like a head of dressed celery. These it moves without dispersing\r\nthe powder: but when dead they fall rapidly to dust. I regret that I did\r\nnot preserve specimens, but I have reason to think that they are the\r\nlarvæ of the _Flata limbata_, or of some other closely allied\r\nspecies[1], though I have not seen in Ceylon any of the wax produced by\r\nthe _flata_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Amongst the specimens of this order which I brought from\r\nCeylon, two proved to be new and undescribed, and have been named by Mr.\r\nA. WHITE _Elidiptera Emersoniana_ and _Poeciloptera Tennentina_.]\r\n\r\nHEMIPTERA. _Bugs_.--On the shrubs in his compound the newly-arrived\r\ntraveller will be attracted by an insect of a pale green hue and\r\ndelicately-thin configuration, which, resting from its recent flight,\r\ncomposes its scanty wings, and moves languidly along the leaf. But\r\nexperience will teach him to limit his examination to a respectful view\r\nof its attitudes; it is one of a numerous family of bugs, (some of them\r\nmost attractive[1] in their colouring,) which are inoffensive if\r\nunmolested, but if touched or irritated, exhale an odour that, once\r\nendured, is never afterwards forgotten.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Such as _Cantuo ocellatus, Leptoscelis Marginalis, Callidea\r\nStockerius_, &c. &c. Of the aquatic species, the gigantic _Belostoma\r\nIndicum_ cannot escape notice, attaining a size of nearly three inches.]\r\n\r\nAPHANIPTERA. _Fleas_.--Fleas are equally numerous, and may be seen in\r\nmyriads in the dust of the streets or skipping in the sunbeams which\r\nfall on the clay floors of the cottages. The dogs, to escape them,\r\nselect for their sleeping places spots where a wood fire has been\r\npreviously kindled; and here prone on the white ashes, their stomachs\r\nclose to the earth, and their hind legs extended behind, they repose in\r\ncomparative coolness, and bid defiance to their persecutors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POECILOPTERA TENNENTINA.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELIDIPTERA EMERSONIANA.]\r\n\r\nDIPTERA. _Mosquitoes_.--But of all the insect pests that beset an\r\nunseasoned European the most provoking by far is the truculent\r\nmosquito.[1] Next to the torture which it inflicts, its most annoying\r\npeculiarities are the booming hum of its approach, its cunning, its\r\naudacity, and the perseverance with which it renews its attacks however\r\nfrequently repulsed. These characteristics are so remarkable as fully to\r\njustify the conjecture that the mosquito, and not the ordinary fly,\r\nconstituted the plague inflicted upon Pharaoh and the Egyptians.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Culex laniger?_ Wied. In Kandy Mr. Thwaites finds _C.\r\nfuscanns, C. circumcolans,_ &c., and one with a most formidable hooked\r\nproboscis, to which he has assigned the appropriate name _C. Regius_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The precise species of insect by means of which the\r\nAlmighty signalised the plague of flies, remains uncertain, as the\r\nHebrew term _arob_ or _oror_ which has been rendered in one place.\r\n\"Divers sorts of flies,\" Ps. cv. 31; and in another, \"swarms of flies,\"\r\nExod. viii. 21, &c., means merely \"an assemblage.\" a \"mixture\" or a\r\n\"swarm,\" and the expletive. \"_of flies_\" is an interpolation of the\r\ntranslators. This, however, serves to show that the fly implied was one\r\neasily recognisable by its habit of _swarming_; and the further fact\r\nthat it _bites_, or rather stings, is elicited from the expression of\r\nthe Psalmist, Ps. lxxviii. 45, that the insects by which the Egyptians\r\nwere tormented \"devoured them,\" so that here are two peculiarities\r\ninapplicable to the domestic fly, but strongly characteristic of gnats\r\nand mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nBruce thought that the fly of the fourth plague was the \"zimb\" of\r\nAbyssinia which he so graphically describes: and WESTWOOD, in an\r\ningenious passage in his _Entomologist's Text-book._ p. 17, combats the\r\nstrange idea of one of the bishops, that it was a cockroach! and argues\r\nin favour of the mosquito. This view he sustains by a reference to the\r\nhabits of the creature, the swarms in which it invades a locality, and\r\nthe audacity with which it enters the houses; and he accounts for the\r\nexemption of \"the land of Goshen in which the Isrælites dwelt,\" by the\r\nfact of its being sandy pasture above the level of the river; whilst the\r\nmosquitoes were produced freely in the rest of Egypt, the soil of which\r\nwas submerged by the rising of the Nile.\r\n\r\nIn all the passages in the Old Testament in which flies are alluded to,\r\notherwise than in connection with the Egyptian infliction, the word used\r\nin the Hebrew is _zevor_, which the Septuagint renders by the ordinary\r\ngeneric term for flies in general, [Greek: muia], \"_musca_\" (Eccles. x.\r\n1, Isaiah vii. 10); but in every instance in which mention is made of\r\nthe miracle of Moses, the Septuagint says that the fly produced was the\r\n[Greek: kunomyia], the \"dog-fly.\" What insect was meant by this name it\r\nis not now easy to determine, but ÆLIAN intimates that the dogfly both\r\ninflicts a wound and emits a booming sound, in both of which particulars\r\nit accords with the mosquito (lib. iv, 51); and PHILO-JUDÆUS, in his\r\n_Vita Mosis_, lib. i. ch. xxiii., descanting on the plague of flies, and\r\nusing the term of the Septuagint, [Greek: kunomyia], describes it as\r\ncombining the characteristic of \"the most impudent of all animals, the\r\nfly and the dog, exhibiting the courage and the cunning of both, and\r\nfastening on its victim with the noise and rapidity of an\r\narrow\"--[Greek: meta roizou kathaper belos]. This seems to identify the\r\ndog-fly of the Septuagint with the description of the Psalmist, Ps.\r\nlxxviii. 45, and to vindicate the conjecture that the tormenting\r\nmosquito, and not the house-fly, was commissioned by the Lord to humble\r\nthe obstinacy of the Egyptian tyrant.]\r\n\r\nEven in the midst of endurance from their onslaughts one cannot but be\r\namused by the ingenuity of their movements; as if aware of the risk\r\nincident to an open assault, a favourite mode of attack is, when\r\nconcealed by a table, to assail the ankles through the meshes of the\r\nstocking, or the knees which are ineffectually protected by a fold of\r\nRussian duck. When you are reading, a mosquito will rarely settle on\r\nthat portion of your hand which is within range of your eyes, but\r\ncunningly stealing by the underside of the book fastens on the wrist or\r\nlittle finger, and noiselessly inserts his proboscis there. I have\r\ntested the classical expedient recorded by Herodotus, who states that\r\nthe fishermen inhabiting the fens of Egypt, cover their beds with their\r\nnets, knowing that the mosquitoes, although they bite through linen\r\nrobes, will not venture through a net.[1] But, notwithstanding the\r\nopinion of Spence[2], that nets with meshes an inch square will\r\neffectually exclude them, I have been satisfied by painful experience\r\nthat (if the theory be not altogether fallacious) at least the modern\r\nmosquitoes of Ceylon are uninfluenced by the same considerations which\r\nrestrained those of the Nile under the successors of Cambyses.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: HERODOTUS, _Euterpe._ xcv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: KIRBY and SPENCE'S _Entomology_, letter iv.]\r\n\r\n_The Coffee-Bug_.--Allusion has been made in a previous passage to the\r\ncoccus known in Ceylon as the \"Coffee-Bug\" (_Lecanium Caffeæ_, Wlk.),\r\nwhich of late years has made such destructive ravages in the plantations\r\nin the Mountain Zone.[1] The first thing that attracts attention on\r\nlooking at a coffee tree infested by it, is the number of brownish\r\nwart-like bodies that stud the young shoots and occasionally the margins\r\non the underside of the leaves.[2] Each of these warts or scales is a\r\ntransformed female, containing a large number of eggs which are hatched\r\nwithin it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The following notice of the \"coffee-bug,\" and of the\r\nsingularly destructive effects produced by it on the plants, has been\r\nprepared chiefly from a memoir presented to the Ceylon Government by the\r\nlate Dr. Gardner, in which he traces the history of the insect from its\r\nfirst appearance in the coffee districts, until it had established\r\nitself more or less permanently in all the estates in full cultivation\r\nthroughout the island.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See the annexed drawing, Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nWhen the young ones come out from their nest, they run about over the\r\nplant like diminutive wood-lice, and at this period there is no apparent\r\ndistinction between male and female. Shortly after being hatched the\r\nmales seek the underside of the leaves, while the females prefer the\r\nyoung shoots as a place of abode. If the under surface of a leaf be\r\nexamined, it will be found to be studded, particularly on its basil\r\nhalf, with minute yellowish-white specks of an oblong form.[1] These are\r\nthe larvæ of the males undergoing transformation into pupæ, beneath\r\ntheir own skins; some of these specks are always in a more advanced\r\nstate than the others, the full-grown ones being whitish and scarcely a\r\nline long. Some of this size are translucent, the insect having escaped;\r\nthe darker ones still retain it within, of an oblong form, with the\r\nrudiment of a wing on each side attached to the lower part of the thorax\r\nand closely applied to the sides; the legs are six in number, the four\r\nhind ones being directed backwards, the anterior forwards (a peculiarity\r\nnot common in other insects); the two antennæ are also inclined\r\nbackwards, and from the tail protrude three short bristles, the middle\r\none thinner and longer than the rest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Figs. 2, and 3 and 5 in the engraving, where these and all\r\nthe other figures are considerably enlarged.]\r\n\r\nWhen the transformation is complete, the mature insect makes its way\r\nfrom beneath the pellucid case[1], all its organs having then attained\r\ntheir full size: the head is sub-globular, with two rather prominent\r\nblack eyes, and two antennæ, each with eleven joints, hairy throughout,\r\nand a tuft of rather longer hairs at the apices; the legs are also\r\ncovered with hairs, the wings are horizontal, of an obovate oblong\r\nshape, membranous, and extending a little farther than the bristles of\r\nthe tail. They have only two nerves, neither of which reaches so far as\r\nthe tips; one of them runs close to the costal margin, and is much\r\nthicker than the other, which branches off from its base and skirts\r\nalong the inner margin; behind the wings is attached a pair of minute\r\nhalteres of peculiar form. The possession of wings would appear to be\r\nthe cause why the full-grown male is more rarely seen on the coffee\r\nbushes than the female.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Fig. 4. Mr. WESTWOOD, who observed the operation in one\r\nspecies, states that they escape backwards, the wings being extended\r\nflatly over the head.]\r\n\r\nThe female, like the male, attaches herself to the surface of the plant,\r\nthe place selected being usually the young shoots; but she is also to be\r\nmet with on the margins of the undersides of the leaves (on the upper\r\nsurface neither the male nor female ever attach themselves); but, unlike\r\nthe male, which derives no nourishment from the juices of the tree (the\r\nmouth being obsolete in the perfect state), she punctures the cuticle\r\nwith a proboscis (a very short three-jointed _promuscis_), springing as\r\nit were from the breast, but capable of being greatly porrected, and\r\ninserted in the cuticle of the plant, and through this she abstracts her\r\nnutriment. In the early pupa state the female is easily distinguishable\r\nfrom the male, by being more elliptical and much more convex. As she\r\nincreases in size her skin distends and she becomes smooth and dry; the\r\nrings of the body become effaced; and losing entirely the form of an\r\ninsect, she presents, for some time, a yellowish pustular shape, but\r\nultimately assumes a roundish conical form, of a dark brown colour.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Figs. 6 and 7. There are many other species of the Coccus\r\ntribe in Ceylon, some (Pseudococcus?) never appearing as a scale, the\r\nfemale wrapping herself up in a white cottony exudation; many species\r\nnearly allied to the true Coccus infest common plants about gardens,\r\nsuch as the Nerium Oleander, Plumeria Acuminata, and others with milky\r\njuices; another subgenus (Ceroplastes?), the female of which produces a\r\nprotecting waxy material, infests the Gendurassa Vulgaris, the Furrcæa\r\nGigantea, the Jak Tree, Mango, and other common trees.]\r\n\r\nUntil she has nearly reached her full size, she still possesses the\r\npower of locomotion, and her six legs are easily distinguishable in the\r\nunder surface of her corpulent body; but at no period of her existence\r\nhas she wings. It is about the time of her obtaining full size that\r\nimpregnation takes place[1]; after which the scale becomes somewhat more\r\nconical, assumes a darker colour, and at length is permanently fixed to\r\nthe surface of the plant, by means of a cottony substance interposed\r\nbetween it and the vegetable cuticle to which it adheres. The scale,\r\nwhen full grown, exactly resembles in miniature the hat of a Cornish\r\nminer[2], there being a narrow rim at the base, which gives increased\r\nsurface of attachment. It is about 1/8 inch in diameter, by about 1/12\r\ndeep, and it appears perfectly smooth to the naked eye; but it is in\r\nreality studded over with a multitude of very minute warts, giving it a\r\ndotted appearance. Except the margin, which is ciliated, it is entirely\r\ndestitute of hairs. The number of eggs contained in one of the scales is\r\nenormous, amounting in a single one to 691. The eggs are of an oblong\r\nshape, of a pale flesh colour, and perfectly smooth.[3] In some of the\r\nscales, the eggs when laid on the field of the microscope resemble those\r\nmasses of life sometimes seen in decayed cheese.[4] A few small\r\nyellowish maggots are sometimes found with them, and these are the\r\nlarvæ[5] of insects, the eggs of which have been deposited in the female\r\nwhile the scale was soft. They escape when mature by cutting a small\r\nround hole in the dorsum of the scale.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: REAUMUR has described the singular manner in which this\r\noccurs. _Mem._ tom. iv.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Figs. 10, 11.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Of the parasitic Chalcididiæ, many genera of which are well\r\nknown to deposit their eggs in the soft Coccus, viz.: Encystus,\r\nCoccophagus, Pteromalus, Mesosela, Agonioneurus; besides Aphidius, a\r\nminutely sized genus of Ichneumonidæ. Most, if not all, of these genera\r\nare Singhalese.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE COFFEE BUG. Lecanium Coffeæ.]\r\n\r\nIt is not till after this pest has been on an estate for two or three\r\nyears that it shows itself to an alarming extent. During the first year\r\na few only of the ripe scales are seen scattered over the bushes,\r\ngenerally on the younger shoots; but that year's crop does not suffer\r\nmuch, and the appearance of the tree is little altered.\r\n\r\nThe second year, however, brings a change for the worse; if the young\r\nshoots and the underside of the leaves he now examined, the scales will\r\nbe found to have become much more numerous, and with them appear a\r\nmultitude of white specks, which are the young scales in a more or less\r\nforward state. The clusters of berries now assume a black sooty look,\r\nand a great number of them fall off before coming to maturity; the\r\ngeneral health of the tree also begins to fail, and it acquires a\r\nblighted appearance. A loss of crop is this year sustained, but to no\r\ngreat extent.\r\n\r\nThe third year brings about a more serious change, the whole plant\r\nacquires a black hue, appearing as if soot had been thrown over it in\r\ngreat quantities; this is caused by the growth of a parasitic fungus[1]\r\nover the shoots and the upper surface of the leaves, forming a fibrous\r\ncoating, somewhat resembling velvet or felt. This never makes its\r\nappearance till the insect has been a considerable time on the bush, and\r\nprobably owes its existence there to an unhealthy condition of the\r\njuices of the leaf, consequent on the irritation produced by the coccus,\r\nsince it never visits the upper surface of the leaf until the latter has\r\nfully established itself on the lower. At this period the young shoots\r\nhave an exceedingly disgusting look from the dense mass of yellow\r\npustular bodies forming on them, the leaves get shrivelled, and the\r\ninfected trees become conspicuous in the row. The black ants are\r\nassiduous in their visits to them. Two-thirds of the crop is lost, and\r\non many trees not a single berry forms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Racodium?_ Species of this genus are not confined to the\r\ncoffee plant alone in Ceylon, but follow the \"bugs\" in their attacks on\r\nother bushes. It appears like a dense interlaced mesh of fibres, each\r\nmade up of a single series of minute oblong vesicles applied end to\r\nend.]\r\n\r\nThis _Lecanium_, or a very closely allied species, has been observed in\r\nthe Botanic Garden at Peradenia, on the _Citrus acida, Psidium\r\npomiferum, Myrtus Zeylanica, Rosa Indica, Careya arborea, Vitex\r\nNegundo_, and other plants. The coffee coccus has generally been first\r\nobserved in moist, hollow places sheltered from the wind; and thence it\r\nhas spread itself even over the driest and most exposed parts of the\r\nisland. On some estates, after attaining a maximum, it has generally\r\ndeclined, but has shown a liability to reappear, especially in low\r\nsheltered situations, and it is believed to prevail most extensively in\r\nwet seasons. While in its earlier stages, it is easily transmitted from\r\none estate to another, on the clothes of human beings, and in various\r\nother ways, which will readily suggest themselves. Dr. Gardner, after a\r\ncareful consideration and minute examination of estates, arrived at the\r\nconclusion, that all remedies suggested up to that time had utterly\r\nfailed, and that none at once cheap and effectual was likely to be\r\ndiscovered. He seems also to have been of opinion that the insect was\r\nnot under human control; and that even if it should disappear, it would\r\nonly be when it should have worn itself out as other blighte have been\r\nknown to do in some mysterious way. Whether this may prove to be the\r\ncase or not, is still very uncertain, but every thing observed by Dr.\r\nGardner tends to indicate the permanency of the pest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_List of Ceylon Insects._\r\n\r\nFor the following list of the insects of the island, and the remarks\r\nprefixed to it, I am indebted to Mr. F. Walker, by whom it has been\r\nprepared after a careful inspection of the collections made by Dr.\r\nTempleton, Mr. E.L. Layard, and others: as well as of those in the\r\nBritish Museum and in the Museum of the East India Company.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The entire of the new species contained in this list have\r\nbeen described in a series of papers by Mr. WALKER in successive numbers\r\nof the _Annals of Natural History_ (1858-61): those, from Dr.\r\nTEMPLETON'S collection of which descriptions have been taken, have been\r\nat his desire transferred to the British Museum for future reference and\r\ncomparison.]\r\n\r\n\"A short notice of the aspect of the island will afford the best means\r\nof accounting, in some degree, for its entomological Fauna: first, as it\r\nis an island, and has a mountainous central region, the tropical\r\ncharacter of its productions, as in most other cases, rather diminishes,\r\nand somewhat approaches that of higher latitudes.\r\n\r\n\"The coast-region of Ceylon, and fully one-third of its northern part,\r\nhave a much drier atmosphere than that of the rest of its surface; and\r\ntheir climate and vegetation are nearly similar to those of the\r\nCarnatic, with which this island may have been connected at no very\r\nremote period.[1] But if, on the contrary, the land in Ceylon is\r\ngradually rising, the difference of its Fauna from that of Central\r\nHindustan is less remarkable. The peninsula of the Dekkan might then be\r\nconjectured to have been nearly or wholly separated from the central\r\npart of Hindustan, and confined to the range of mountains along the\r\neastern coast; the insect-fauna of which is as yet almost unknown, but\r\nwill probably be found to have more resemblance to that of Ceylon than\r\nto the insects of northern and western India--just as the insect-fauna\r\nof Malaya appears more to resemble the similar productions of\r\nAustralasia than those of the more northern continent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On the subject of this conjecture see _ante_, p. 60.]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Layard's collection was partly formed in the dry northern province\r\nof Ceylon; and among them more Hindustan insects are to be observed than\r\namong those collected by Dr. Templeton, and found wholly in the district\r\nbetween Colombo and Kandy. According to this view the faunas of the\r\nNilgherry Mountains, of Central Ceylon, of the peninsula of Malacca, and\r\nof Australasia would be found to form one group;--while those of\r\nNorthern Ceylon, of the western Dekkan, and of the level parts of\r\nCentral Hindustan would form another of more recent origin. The\r\ninsect-fauna of the Carnatic is also probably similar to that of the\r\nlowlands of Ceylon; but it is still unexplored. The regions of Hindustan\r\nin which species have been chiefly collected, such as Bengal, Silbet,\r\nand the Punjaub, are at the distance of from 1300 to 1600 miles from\r\nCeylon, and therefore the insects of the latter are fully as different\r\nfrom those of the above regions as they are from those of Australasia,\r\nto which Ceylon is as near in point of distance, and agrees more with\r\nregard to latitude.\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Hagen has remarked that he believes the fauna of the mountains of\r\nCeylon to be quite different from that of the plains and of the shores.\r\nThe south and west districts have a very moist climate, and as their\r\nvegetation is like that of Malabar, their insect-fauna will probably\r\nalso resemble that of the latter region.\r\n\r\n\"The insects mentioned in the following list are thus distributed:--\r\n\r\n\"Order COLEOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"The recorded species of _Cicindelidæ_ inhabit the plains or the coast\r\ncountry of Ceylon, and several of them are also found in Hindustan.\r\n\r\n\"Many of the species of _Carabidæ_ and of _Staphylinidæ_, especially\r\nthose collected by Mr. Thwaites, near Kandy, and by M. Nietner at\r\nColombo, have much resemblance to the insects of these two families in\r\nNorth Europe; in the _Scydmænid, Ptiliadæ, Phalacridæ, Nitidulidæ,\r\nColydiadæ_, and _Lathridiadæ_ the northern form is still more striking,\r\nand strongly contrasts with the tropical forms of the gigantic _Copridæ,\r\nBuprestidæ, and Cerambycidæ_, and with the _Elateridæ, Lampyridæ,\r\nTenebrionidæ, Helopidæ, Meloidæ, Curculionidæ, Prionidæ, Cerambycidæ,\r\nLamiidæ_, and _Endomychidæ_.\r\n\r\n\"The _Copridæ, Dynastidæ, Melolonthidæ, Cetoniadæ_, and _Passalidæ_ are\r\nwell represented on the plains and on the coast, and the species are\r\nmostly of a tropical character.\r\n\r\n\"The _Hydrophilidæ_ have a more northern aspect, as is generally the\r\ncase with aquatic species.\r\n\r\n\"The order _Strepsiptera_ is here considered as belonging to the\r\n_Mordellidæ_, and is represented by the genus _Myrmecolax_, which is\r\npeculiar, as yet, to Ceylon.\r\n\r\n\"In the _Curculionidæ_ the single species of _Apion_ will recall to mind\r\nthe great abundance of that genus in North Europe.\r\n\r\n\"The _Prionidæ_ and the two following families have been investigated by\r\nMr. Pascoe, and the _Hispidæ_, with the five following families, by Mr.\r\nBaly; these two gentlemen are well acquainted with the above tribes of\r\nbeetles, and kindly supplied me with the names of the Ceylon species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder ORTHOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"These insects in Ceylon have mostly a tropical aspect. The _Physapoda_,\r\nwhich will probably be soon incorporated with them, are likely to be\r\nnumerous, though only one species has as yet been noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder NEUROPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"The list here given is chiefly taken from the catalogue published by\r\nDr. Hagen, and containing descriptions of the species named by him or by\r\nM. Nietner. They were found in the most elevated parts of the island,\r\nnear Rangbodde, and Dr. Hagen informs me that not less than 500 species\r\nhave been noticed in Ceylon, but that they are not yet recorded, with\r\nthe exception of the species here enumerated. It has been remarked that\r\nthe _Trichoptera_ and other aquatic _Neuroptera_ are less local than the\r\nland species, owing to the more equable temperature of the habitation of\r\ntheir larvæ, and on account of their being often conveyed along the\r\nwhole length of rivers. The species of _Psocus_ in the list are far more\r\nnumerous than those yet observed in any other country, with the\r\nexception of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder HYMENOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"In this order the _Formicidæ_ and the _Poneridæ_ are very numerous, as\r\nthey are in other damp and woody tropical countries. Seventy species of\r\nants have been observed, but as yet few of them have been named. The\r\nvarious other families of aculeate _Hymenoptera_ are doubtless more\r\nabundant than the species recorded indicate, and it may be safely\r\nreckoned that the parasitic _Hymenoptera_ in Ceylon far exceed one\r\nthousand species in number, though they are yet only known by means of\r\nabout two dozen kinds collected at Kandy by Mr. Thwaites.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder LEPIDOPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"The fauna of Ceylon is much better known in this order than in any\r\nother of the insect tribes, but as yet the _Lepidoptera_ alone in their\r\nclass afford materials for a comparison of the productions of Ceylon\r\nwith those of Hindustan and of Australasia; nine hundred and thirty-two\r\nspecies have been collected by Dr. Templeton and by Mr. Layard in the\r\ncentral, western, and northern parts of the island. All the families,\r\nfrom the _Papilionidæ_ to the _Tineidæ_, abound, and numerous species\r\nand several genera appear, as yet, to be peculiar to the island. As\r\nCeylon is situate at the entrance to the eastern regions, the list in\r\nthis volume will suitably precede the descriptive catalogues of the\r\nheterocerous _Lepidoptera_ of Hindustan, Java, Borneo, and of other\r\nparts of Australasia, which are being prepared for publication. In some\r\nof the heterocerous families several species are common to Ceylon and to\r\nAustralasia, and in various cases the faunas of Ceylon and of\r\nAustralasia seem to be more similar than those of Ceylon and of\r\nHindustan. The long intercourse between those two regions may have been\r\nthe means of conveying some species from one to the other. Among the\r\n_Pyralites, Hymenia recurvalis_ inhabits also the West Indies, South\r\nAmerica, West Africa, Hindustan, China, Australasia, Australia, and New\r\nZealand; and its food-plant is probably some vegetable which is\r\ncultivated in all those regions; so also _Desmia afflictalis_ is found\r\nin Sierra Leone, Abyssinia, Ceylon, and China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder DIPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"About fifty species were observed by Dr. Templeton, but most of those\r\nhere recorded were collected by Mr. Thwaites at Kandy, and have a great\r\nlikeness to North European species. The mosquitoes are very annoying on\r\naccount of their numbers, as might be expected from the moisture and\r\nheat of the climate. _Culex laniger_ is the coast species, and the other\r\nkinds here mentioned are from Kandy. Humboldt observed that in some\r\nparts of South America each stream had its peculiar mosquitoes, and it\r\nyet remains to be seen whether the gnats in Ceylon are also thus\r\nrestricted in their habitation. The genera _Sciara, Cecidomyia_, and\r\n_Simulium_, which abound so exceedingly in temperate countries, have\r\neach one representative species in the collection made by Mr. Thwaites.\r\nThus an almost new field remains for the Entomologist in the study of\r\nthe yet unknown Singhalese Diptera, which must be very numerous.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder HEMIPTERA.\r\n\r\n\"The species of this order in the list are too few and too similar to\r\nthose of Hindustan to need any particular mention. _Lecanium coffeæ_ may\r\nbe noticed, on account of its infesting the coffee plant, as its name\r\nindicates, and the ravages of other species of the genus will be\r\nremembered, from the fact that one of them, in other regions, has put a\r\nstop to the cultivation of the orange as an article of commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In conclusion, it may be observed that the species of insects in Ceylon\r\nmay be estimated as exceeding 10,000 in number, of which about 2000 are\r\nenumerated in this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass ARACHNIDA.\r\n\r\n\"Four or five species of spiders, of which the specimens cannot be\r\nsatisfactorily described; one _Ixodes_ and one _Chelifer_ have been\r\nforwarded to England from Ceylon by Mr. Thwaites.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The asterisk prefixed denotes the species discovered in Ceylon\r\nsince Sir J.E.

XIII.\r\n\r\nARTICULATA.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Arachinida--Myriopoda--Crustacea, etc._\r\n\r\nWith a few striking exceptions, the true _spiders_ of Ceylon resemble in\r\noeconomy and appearance those we are accustomed to see at home;--they\r\nfrequent the houses, the gardens, the rocks and the stems of trees, and\r\nalong the sunny paths, where the forest meets the open country, the\r\n_Epeira_ and her congeners, the true net-weaving spiders, extend their\r\nlacework, the grace of the designs being even less attractive than the\r\nbeauty of the creatures that elaborate them.\r\n\r\nSuch of them as live in the woods select with singular sagacity the\r\nbridle-paths and narrow passages for expanding their nets; perceiving no\r\ndoubt that the larger insects frequent these openings for facility of\r\nmovement through the jungle; and that the smaller ones are carried\r\ntowards them by currents of air. Their nets are stretched across the\r\npath from four to eight feet above the ground, suspended from projecting\r\nshoots, and attached, if possible, to thorny shrubs; and they sometimes\r\nexhibit the most remarkable scenes of carnage and destruction. I have\r\ntaken down a ball as large as a man's head consisting of successive\r\nlayers rolled together, in the heart of which was the original den of\r\nthe family, whilst the envelope was formed, sheet after sheet, by coils\r\nof the old web filled with the wings and limbs of insects of all\r\ndescriptions, from large moths and butterflies to mosquitoes and minute\r\ncoleoptera. Each layer appeared to have been originally hung across the\r\npassage to intercept the expected prey; and, when it had become\r\nsurcharged with carcases, to have been loosened, tossed over by the wind\r\nor its own weight, and wrapped round the nucleus in the centre, the\r\nspider replacing it by a fresh sheet, to be in turn detached and added\r\nto the mass within.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spider]\r\n\r\nSeparated by marked peculiarities both of structure and instinct, from\r\nthe spiders which live in the open air, and busy themselves in providing\r\nfood during the day, the _Mygale fasciata_ is not only sluggish in its\r\nhabits, but disgusting in its form and dimensions. Its colour is a\r\ngloomy brown, interrupted by irregular blotches and faint bands (whence\r\nits trivial name); it is sparingly sprinkled with hairs, and its limbs,\r\nwhen expanded, stretch over an area of six to eight inches in diameter.\r\nIt is familiar to Europeans in Ceylon, who have given it the name, and\r\nascribed to it the fabulous propensities, of the Tarentula.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Species of the true _Tarentula_ are not uncommon in Ceylon;\r\nthey are all of very small size, and perfectly harmless.]\r\n\r\nThe Mygale is found abundantly in the northern and eastern parts of the\r\nisland, and occasionally in dark unfrequented apartments in the western\r\nprovince; but its inclinations are solitary, and it shuns the busy\r\ntraffic of towns.\r\n\r\nThe largest specimens I have seen were at Gampola in the vicinity of\r\nKandy, and one taken in the store-room of the rest-house there, nearly\r\ncovered with its legs an ordinary-sized breakfast plate.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Plate opposite.]\r\n\r\nThis hideous creature does not weave a broad web or spin a net like\r\nother spiders, but nevertheless it forms a comfortable mansion in the\r\nwall of a neglected building, the hollow of a tree, or under the eave of\r\nan overhanging stone. This it lines throughout with a tapestry of silk\r\nof a tubular form; and of a texture so exquisitely fine and closely\r\nwoven, that no moisture can penetrate it. The extremity of the tube is\r\ncarried out to the entrance, where it expands into a little platform,\r\nstayed by braces to the nearest objects that afford a firm hold. In\r\nparticular situations, where the entrance is exposed to the wind, the\r\nmygale, on the approach of the monsoon, extends the strong tissue above\r\nit so as to serve as an awning to prevent the access of rain.\r\n\r\nThe construction of this silken dwelling is exclusively designed for the\r\ndomestic luxury of the spider; it serves no purpose in trapping or\r\nsecuring prey, and no external disturbance of the web tempts the\r\ncreature to sally out to surprise an intruder, as the epeira and its\r\ncongeners would.\r\n\r\nBy day it remains concealed in its den, whence it issues at night to\r\nfeed on larvæ and worms, devouring cockroaches and their pupæ, and\r\nattacking the millepeds, gryllotalpæ, and other fleshy insects.\r\n\r\nMr. EDGAR L. LAYARD has described[1] an encounter between a Mygale and a\r\ncockroach, which he witnessed in the madua of a temple at Alittane,\r\nbetween Anarajapoora and Dambool. When about a yard apart, each\r\ndiscerned the other and stood still, the spider with his legs slightly\r\nbent and his body raised, the cockroach confronting him and directing\r\nhis antennæ with a restless undulation towards his enemy. The spider, by\r\nstealthy movements, approached to within a few inches and paused, both\r\nparties eyeing each other intently; then suddenly a rush, a scuffle, and\r\nboth fell to the ground, when the blatta's wings closed, the spider\r\nseized it under the throat with his claws, and dragged it into a corner,\r\nwhen the action of his jaws was distinctly audible. Next morning Mr.\r\nLayard found that the soft parts of the body had been eaten, nothing but\r\nthe head, thorax, and clytra remaining.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ann. and Mag. Nat. Hist._ May, 1853.]\r\n\r\nBut, in addition to minor and ignoble prey, the Mygale rests under the\r\nimputation of seizing small birds and feasting on their blood. The\r\nauthor who first gave popular currency to this story was Madame MERIAN,\r\na zoological artist of the last century, many of whose drawings are\r\nstill preserved in the Museums of St. Petersburg, Holland, and England.\r\nIn a work on the Insects of Surinam, published in 1705[1], she figured\r\nthe _Mygale aricularia_, in the act of devouring a humming-bird. The\r\naccuracy of her statement has since been impugned[2] by a correspondent\r\nof the Zoological Society of London, on the ground that the mygale makes\r\nno net, but lives in recesses, to which no humming-bird would resort;\r\nand hence, the writer somewhat illogically declares, that he\r\n\"disbelieves the existence of any bird-catching spider.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Dissertatio de Generatione et Metamorphosibus Insectorum\r\nSurinamensium_, Amst. 1701. Fol.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: By Mr. MACLEAY in a paper communicated to the Zoological\r\nSociety of London, _Proc._ 1834, p. 12.]\r\n\r\nSome years later, however, the same writer felt it incumbent on him to\r\nqualify this hasty conclusion[1], in consequence of having seen at\r\nSydney an enormous spider, the _Epeira diadema_, in the act of sucking\r\nthe juices of a bird (the _Zosterops dorsalis_ of Vigors and Horsfield),\r\nwhich, it had caught in the meshes of its geometrical net. This\r\ncircumstance, however, did not in his opinion affect the case of the\r\n_Mygale_; and even as regards the _Epeira_, Mr. MacLeay, who witnessed\r\nthe occurrence, was inclined to believe the instance to be accidental\r\nand exceptional; \"an exception indeed so rare, that no other person had\r\never witnessed the fact.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _Ann. and Mag. of Nat. Hist._ for 1842, vol. viii. p.\r\n324.]\r\n\r\nSubsequent observation has, however, served to sustain the story of\r\nMadame Merian.[1] Baron Walckenær and Latreille both corroborated it by\r\nother authorities; and M. Moreau da Jonnès, who studied the habits of\r\nthe Mygale in Martinique, says it hunts far and wide in search of its\r\nprey, conceals itself beneath leaves for the purpose of surprising them,\r\nand climbs the branches of trees to devour the young of the\r\nhumming-bird, and of the _Certhia flaveola_. As to its mode of attack,\r\nM. Jonnès says that when it throws itself on its victim it clings to it\r\nby the double hooks of its tarsi, and strives to reach the back of the\r\nhead, to insert its jaws between the skull and the vertebræ.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See authorities quoted by Mr. SHUCKARD in the _Ann. and\r\nMag. of Nat. Hist._ 1842, vol. viii. p. 436, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: At a meeting of the Entomological Society, July 20, 1855, a\r\npaper was read by Mr. H.W. BATES, who stated that in 1849 at Cameta in\r\nBrazil, he \"was attracted by a curious movement of the large grayish\r\nbrown Mygale on the trunk of a vast tree: it was close beneath a deep\r\ncrevice or chink in the tree, across which this species weaves a dense\r\nweb, at one end open for its exit and entrance. In the present instance\r\nthe lower part of the web was broken, and two small finches were\r\nentangled in its folds. The finch was about the size of the common\r\nSiskin of Europe, and he judged the two to be male and female; one of\r\nthem was quite dead, but secured in the broken web; the other was under\r\nthe body of the spider, not quite dead, and was covered in parts with a\r\nfilthy liquor or saliva exuded by the monster. \"The species of spider,\"\r\nMr. Bates says, \"I cannot name; it is wholly of a gray brown colour, and\r\nclothed with coarse pile.\" \"If the Mygales,\" he adds, \"did not prey upon\r\nvertebrated animals, I do not see how they could find sufficient\r\nsubsistence.\"--_The Zoologist_, vol. xiii. p. 480.]\r\n\r\nFor my own part, no instance came to my knowledge in Ceylon of a mygale\r\nattacking a bird; but PERCIVAL, who wrote his account of the island in\r\n1805, describes an enormous spider (possibly an Epeirid) thinly covered\r\nwith hair which \"makes webs strong enough to entangle and hold even\r\nsmall birds that form its usual food.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: PERCIVAL'S _Ceylon_, p. 313.]\r\n\r\nThe fact of its living on millepeds, blattæ, and crickets, is\r\nuniversally known; and a lady who lived at Marandahn, near Colombo, told\r\nme that she had, on one occasion, seen a little house-lizard (_gecko_)\r\nseized and devoured by one of these ugly spiders.\r\n\r\nWalckenær has described a spider of large size, under the name of _Olios\r\nTaprobanius_, which is very common in Ceylon, and conspicuous from the\r\nfiery hue of the under surface, the remainder being covered with gray\r\nhair so short and fine that the body seems almost denuded. It spins a\r\nmoderate-sized web, hung vertically between two sets of strong lines,\r\nstretched one above the other athwart the pathways. Some of the threads\r\nthus carried horizontally from tree to tree at a considerable height\r\nfrom the ground are so strong as to cause a painful check across the\r\nface when moving quickly against them; and more than once in riding I\r\nhave had my hat lifted off my head by one of these cords.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Over the country generally are scattered species of\r\n_Gasteracantha_, remarkable for their firm shell-covered bodies, with\r\nprojecting knobs arranged in pairs. In habit these anomalous-looking\r\n_Epeirdæ_ appear to differ in no respect from the rest of the family,\r\nwaylaying their prey in similar situations and in the same manner.\r\n\r\nAnother very singular subgenus, met with in Ceylon, is distinguished by\r\nthe abdomen being dilated behind, and armed with two long spines,\r\narching obliquely backwards. These abnormal kinds are not so handsomely\r\ncoloured as the smaller species of typical form.]\r\n\r\nAn officer in the East India Company's Service[1], in a communication to\r\nthe Asiatic Society of Bengal, describes the gigantic web of a black and\r\nred spider six inches in diameter, (his description of which, both in\r\ncolour and size, seems to point to some species closely allied to the\r\n_Olios Taprobanius_,) which he saw near Monghyr on the Ganges; in this\r\nweb \"a bird was entangled, and the young spiders, eight in number, and\r\nentirely of a brick red colour, were feeding on the carcase.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Capt. Sherwill.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Jour. Asiat. Soc. Bengal_, 1850, vol. xix. p. 475.]\r\n\r\nThe voracious _Galeodes_ has not yet been noticed in Ceylon; but its\r\ncarnivorous propensities are well known in those parts of Hindustan,\r\nwhere it is found, and where it lives upon crickets, coleoptera and\r\nother insects, as well as small lizards and birds. This \"tiger of the\r\ninsect world,\" as it has aptly been designated by a gentleman who was a\r\nwitness to its ferocity[1], was seen to attack a young sparrow half\r\ngrown, and seize it by the thigh, _which it sawed through_. The \"savage\r\nthen caught the bird by the throat, and put an end to its sufferings by\r\ncutting off its head.\" \"On another occasion,\" says the same authority,\r\n\"Dr. Baddeley confined one of these spiders under a glass wall-shade\r\nwith two young musk-rats (_Sorex Indicus_), both of which it destroyed.\"\r\nIt must be added, however, that neither in the instance of the bird, of\r\nthe lizard, or the rats, did the galeodes devour its prey after killing\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Capt. Hutton. See a paper on the _Galeodes voræ_ in the\r\n_Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal_, vol. xi. Part 11. p. 860.]\r\n\r\nIn the hills around Pusilawa, I have seen the haunts of a curious\r\nspecies of long-legged spiders[1], popularly called \"harvest-men,\" which\r\ncongregate in hollow trees and in holes in the banks by the roadside, in\r\ngroups of from fifty to a hundred, that to a casual observer look like\r\nbunches of horse-hair. This appearance is produced by the long and\r\nslender legs of these creatures, which are of a shining black, whilst\r\ntheir bodies, so small as to be mere specks, are concealed beneath them.\r\nThe same spider is found in the low country near Galle, but there it\r\nshows no tendency to become gregarious. Can it be that they thus\r\nassemble in groups in the hills for the sake of accumulated warmth at\r\nthe cool altitude of 4000 feet?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Phalangium bisignatum_.]\r\n\r\n_Ticks_.--Ticks are to be classed among the intolerable nuisances to the\r\nCeylon traveller. They live in immense numbers in the jungle[1], and\r\nattaching themselves to the plants by the two forelegs, lie in wait to\r\ncatch at unwary animals as they pass. A shower of these diminutive\r\nvermin will sometimes drop from a branch, if unluckily shaken, and\r\ndisperse themselves over the body, each fastening on the neck, the ears,\r\nand eyelids, and inserting a barbed proboscis. They burrow, with their\r\nheads pressed as far as practicable under the skin, causing a sensation\r\nof smarting, as if particles of red hot sand had been scattered over the\r\nflesh. If torn from their hold, the suckers remain behind and form an\r\nulcer. The only safe expedient is to tolerate the agony of their\r\npenetration till a drop of coco-nut oil or the juice of a lime can be\r\napplied, when these little furies drop off without further ill\r\nconsequences. One very large species, dappled with grey, attaches itself\r\nto the buffaloes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. HOOKER, in his _Himalayan Journal_, vol. i. p. 279, in\r\nspeaking of the multitude of those creatures in the mountains of Nepal,\r\nwonders what they tend to feed on, as in these humid forests in which\r\nthey literally swarmed, there was neither pathway nor animal life. In\r\nCeylon they abound everywhere in the plains on the low brush-wood; and\r\nin the very driest seasons they are quite as numerous as at other times.\r\nIn the mountain zone, which is more humid, they are less prevalent. Dogs\r\nare tormented by them: and they display something closely allied to\r\ncunning in always fastening on an animal in those parts where they\r\ncannot be torn off by his paws; on his eye-brows, the tips of his ears,\r\nand the back of his neck. With a corresponding instinct I have always\r\nobserved in the gambols of the Pariah dogs, that they invariably\r\ncommence their attentions by mutually gnawing each other's ears and\r\nnecks, as if in pursuit of ticks from places from which each is unable\r\nto expel them for himself. Horses have a similar instinct; and when they\r\nmeet, they apply their teeth to the roots of the ears of their\r\ncompanions, to the neck and the crown of the head. The buffaloes and\r\noxen are relieved of ticks by the crows which rest on their backs as\r\nthey browse, and free them from these pests. In the low country the same\r\nacceptable office is performed by the \"cattle-keeper heron\" (_Ardea\r\nbubulcus_), which is \"sure to be found in attendance on them while\r\ngrazing; and the animals seem to know their benefactors, and stand\r\nquietly, while the birds peck their tormentors from their\r\nflanks.\"--_Mag. Nat. Hist._ p. 111, 1844.]\r\n\r\n_Mites_.--The _Trombidium tinctorum_ of Hermann is found about Aripo,\r\nand generally over the northern provinces,--where after a shower of rain\r\nor heavy night's dew, they appear in countless myriads. It is about half\r\nan inch long, like a tuft of crimson velvet, and imparts its colouring\r\nmatter readily to any fluid in which it may be immersed. It feeds on\r\nvegetable juices, and is perfectly innocuous. Its European\r\nrepresentative, similarly tinted, and found in garden mould, is commonly\r\ncalled the \"Little red pillion.\"\r\n\r\nMYRIAPODS.--The certainty with which an accidental pressure or unguarded\r\ntouch is resented and retorted by a bite, makes the centipede, when it\r\nhas taken up its temporary abode, within a sleeve or the fold of a\r\ndress, by far the most unwelcome of all the Singhalese assailants. The\r\ngreat size, too (little short of a foot in length), to which it\r\nsometimes attains, renders it formidable, and, apart from the\r\napprehension of unpleasant consequences from a wound, one shudders at\r\nthe bare idea of such a hideous creature crawling over the skin, beneath\r\nthe innermost folds of one's garments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CERMATIA.]\r\n\r\nAt the head of the _Myriapods_, and pre-eminent from a\r\nsuperiorly-developed organisation, stands the genus _Cermatia_:\r\nsingular-looking objects; mounted upon slender legs, of gradually\r\nincreasing length from front to rear, the hind ones in some species\r\nbeing amazingly prolonged, and all handsomely marked with brown annuli\r\nin concentric arches. These myriapods are harmless, excepting to\r\nwoodlice, spiders, and young cockroaches, which form their ordinary\r\nprey. They are rarely to be seen; but occasionally at daybreak, after a\r\nmore than usually abundant repast, they may be observed motionless, and\r\nresting with their regularly extended limbs nearly flat against the\r\nwalls. On being disturbed they dart away with a surprising velocity, to\r\nconceal themselves in chinks until the return of night.\r\n\r\nBut the species to be really dreaded are the true _Scolopendræ_, which\r\nare active and carnivorous, living in holes in old walls and other\r\ngloomy dens. One species[1] attains to nearly the length of a foot, with\r\ncorresponding breadth; it is of a dark purple colour, approaching black,\r\nwith yellowish legs and antennæ, and in its whole aspect repulsive and\r\nfrightful. It is strong and active, and evinces an eager disposition to\r\nfight when molested. The _Scolopendræ_ are gifted by nature with a rigid\r\ncoriaceous armour, which does not yield to common pressure, or even to a\r\nmoderate blow; so that they often escape the most well-deserved and\r\nwell-directed attempts to destroy them, seeking refuge in retreats which\r\neffectually conceal them from sight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Scolopendra crassa_, Temp.]\r\n\r\nThere is a smaller species[1], that frequents dwelling-houses; it is\r\nabout one quarter the size of the preceding, and of a dirty olive\r\ncolour, with pale ferruginous legs. It is this species that generally\r\ninflicts the wound, when persons complain of being bitten by a scorpion;\r\nand it has a mischievous propensity for insinuating itself into the\r\nfolds of dress. The bite at first does not occasion more suffering than\r\nwould arise from the penetration of two coarsely-pointed needles; but\r\nafter a little time the wound swells, becomes acutely painful, and if it\r\nbe over a bone or any other resisting part, the sensation is so\r\nintolerable as to produce fever. The agony subsides after a few hours'\r\nduration. In some cases the bite is unattended by any particular degree\r\nof annoyance, and in these instances it is to be supposed that the\r\ncontents of the poison gland had become exhausted by previous efforts,\r\nsince, if much tasked, the organ requires rest to enable it to resume\r\nits accustomed functions and to secrete a supply of venom.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Scolopendra pallipes_.]\r\n\r\n_The Fish-insect_.--The chief inconvenience of a residence in Ceylon,\r\nboth on the coast and in the mountains, is the prevalence of damp, and\r\nthe difficulty of protecting articles liable to injury from this cause.\r\nBooks, papers, and manuscripts rapidly decay; especially during the\r\nsouth-west monsoon, when the atmosphere is saturated with moisture.\r\nUnless great precautions are taken, the binding fades and yields, the\r\nleaves grow mouldy and stained, and letter-paper, in an incredibly short\r\ntime, becomes so spotted and spongy as to be unfit for use. After a very\r\nfew seasons of neglect, a book falls to pieces, and its decomposition\r\nattracts hordes of minute insects, that swarm to assist in the work of\r\ndestruction. The concealment of these tiny creatures during daylight\r\nrenders it difficult to watch their proceedings, or to discriminate the\r\nprecise species most actively engaged; but there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that the larvæ of the death-watch and numerous acari are amongst\r\nthe most active. As nature seldom peoples a region supplied with\r\nabundance of suitable food, without, at the same time, taking measures\r\nof precaution against the disproportionate increase of individuals; so\r\nhave these vegetable depredators been provided with foes who pursue and\r\nfeed greedily upon them. These are of widely different genera; but\r\ninstead of their services being gratefully recognised, they are\r\npopularly branded as accomplices in the work of destruction. One of\r\nthese ill-used creatures is a tiny, tail-less scorpion (_Chelifer_[1]),\r\nand another is the pretty little silvery creature (_Lepisma_), called by\r\nEuropeans the \"fish-insect.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Of the first of these, three species have been noticed in\r\nCeylon, all with the common characteristics of being nocturnal, very\r\nactive, very minute, of a pale chesnut colour, and each armed with a\r\ncrab-like claw. They are\r\n\r\n  _Chelifer Librorum_, Temp.\r\n  _Chelifer oblongus_, Temp.\r\n  _Chelifer acaroides_, Hermann.\r\n\r\nDr. Templeton appears to have been puzzled to account for the appearance\r\nof the latter species in Ceylon, so far from its native country, but it\r\nhas most certainly been introduced from Europe, in Dutch or Portuguese\r\nbooks.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Lepisma niveo-fasciata_, Templeton, and _L. niger_, Temp.\r\nIt was called \"Lepisma\" by Fabricius, from its fish-like scales. It has\r\nsix legs, filiform antenna, and the abdomen terminated by three\r\nelongated setæ, two of which are placed nearly at right angles to the\r\ncentral one. LINNÆUS states that the European species, with which book\r\ncollectors are familiar, was first brought in sugar ships from America.\r\nHence, possibly, these are more common in seaport towns in the South of\r\nEngland and elsewhere, and it is almost certain that, like the chelifer,\r\none of the species found on book-shelves in Ceylon, has been brought\r\nthither from Europe.]\r\n\r\nThe latter, which is a familiar genus, comprises several species, of\r\nwhich only two have as yet been described; one is of a large size, most\r\ngraceful in its movements, and singularly beautiful in appearance, owing\r\nto the whiteness of the pearly scales from which its name is derived.\r\nThese, contrasted with the dark hue of the other parts, and its\r\ntri-partite tail, attract the eye as the insect darts rapidly along.\r\nLike the chelifer, it shuns the light, hiding in chinks till sunset, but\r\nis actively engaged throughout the night feasting on the acari and\r\nsoft-bodied insects which assail books and papers.\r\n\r\n_Millepeds_.--In the hot dry season, and more especially in the northern\r\nportions of the island, the eye is attracted along the edges of the\r\nsandy roads by fragments of the dislocated rings of a huge species of\r\nmillepede[1], lying in short curved tubes, the cavity admitting the tip\r\nof the little finger. When perfect the creature is two-thirds of a foot\r\nlong, of a brilliant jet black, and with above a hundred yellow legs,\r\nwhich, when moving onward, present the appearance of a series of\r\nundulations from rear to front, bearing the animal gently forwards. This\r\n_Julus_ is harmless, and may be handled with perfect impunity. Its food\r\nconsists chiefly of fruits and the roots and stems of succulent\r\nvegetables, its jaws not being framed for any more formidable purpose.\r\nAnother and a very pretty species[2], quite as black, but with a bright\r\ncrimson band down the back, and the legs similarly tinted, is common in\r\nthe gardens about Colombo and throughout the western province.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Julus ater_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Julus carnifex_, Fab.]\r\n\r\nCRUSTACEA.--The seas around Ceylon abound with marine articulata; but a\r\nknowledge of the crustacea of the island is at present a desideratum;\r\nand with the exception of the few commoner species that frequent the\r\nshores, or are offered in the markets, we are literally without\r\ninformation, excepting the little that can be gleaned from already\r\npublished systematic works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALLING CRAB OF CEYLON.]\r\n\r\nIn the bazaars several species of edible crabs are exposed for sale; and\r\namongst the delicacies at the tables of Europeans, curries made from\r\nprawns and lobsters are the triumphs of the Ceylon cuisine. Of these\r\nlatter the fishermen sometimes exhibit specimens[1] of extraordinary\r\ndimensions and of a beautiful purple hue, variegated with white. Along\r\nthe level shore north and south of Colombo, and in no less profusion\r\nelsewhere, the nimble little Calling Crabs[2] scamper over the moist\r\nsands, carrying aloft the enormous hand (sometimes larger than the rest\r\nof the body), which is their peculiar characteristic, and which, from\r\nits beckoning gesture has suggested their popular name. They hurry to\r\nconceal themselves in the deep retreats which they hollow out in the\r\nbanks that border the sea.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Palinurus ornatus_, Fab. P--n. s.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Gelasimus tetragonon_? Edw.; _G. annulipes_? Edw.; _G.\r\nDussumieri_? Edw.]\r\n\r\n_Sand Crabs_.--In the same localities, or a little farther inland, the\r\n_Ocypode_[1] burrows in the dry soil, making deep excavations, bringing\r\nup literally armfulls of sand; which with a spring in the air, and\r\nemploying its other limbs, it jerks far from its burrows, distributing\r\nit in a circle to the distance of several feet.[2] So inconvenient are\r\nthe operations of these industrious pests that men are kept regularly\r\nemployed at Colombo in filling up the holes formed by them on the\r\nsurface of the Galle face. This, the only equestrian promenade of the\r\ncapital, is so infested by these active little creatures that accidents\r\noften occur through horses stumbling in their troublesome excavations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ocypode ceratophthamus_. Pall.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ann. Nat. Hist_. April, 1852. Paper by Mr. EDGAR L.\r\nLAYARD.]\r\n\r\n_Painted Crabs_.--On the reef of rocks which lies to the south of the\r\nharbour at Colombo, the beautiful little painted crabs[1], distinguished\r\nby dark red markings on a yellow ground, may be seen all day long\r\nrunning nimbly in the spray, and ascending and descending in security\r\nthe almost perpendicular sides of the rocks which are washed by the\r\nwaves. _Paddling Crabs_[2], with the hind pair of legs terminated by\r\nflattened plates to assist them in swimming, are brought up in the\r\nfishermen's nets. _Hermit Crabs_ take possession of the deserted shells\r\nof the univalves, and crawl in pursuit of garbage along the moist beach.\r\nPrawns and shrimps furnish delicacies for the breakfast table; and the\r\ndelicate little pea crab, _Pontonia inflata_[3], recalls its\r\nMediterranean congener[4], which attracted the attention of Aristotle,\r\nfrom taking up its habitation in the shell of the living pinna.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Grapsus strigosus_, Herbst.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Neptunus pelagicus_, Linn.; _N. sanguinolentus_, Herbst,\r\n&c. &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: MILNE EDW., _Hist.

They are terrestrial, never visiting ponds or streams. In\r\nsize they are about an inch in length, and as fine as a common knitting\r\nneedle; but they are capable of distension till they equal a quill in\r\nthickness, and attain a length of nearly two inches. Their structure is\r\nso flexible that they can insinuate themselves through the meshes of the\r\nfinest stocking, not only seizing on the feet and ankles, but ascending\r\nto the back and throat and fastening on the tenderest parts of the body.\r\nIn order to exclude them, the coffee planters, who live amongst these\r\npests, are obliged to envelope their legs in \"leech gaiters\" made of\r\nclosely woven cloth. The natives smear their bodies with oil, tobacco\r\nashes, or lemon juice[2]; the latter serving not only to stop the flow\r\nof blood, but to expedite the healing of the wounds. In moving, the land\r\nleeches have the power of planting one extremity on the earth and\r\nraising the other perpendicularly to watch for their victim. Such is\r\ntheir vigilance and instinct, that on the approach of a passer-by to a\r\nspot which they infest, they may be seen amongst the grass and fallen\r\nleaves on the edge of a native path, poised erect, and preparing for\r\ntheir attack on man and horse. On descrying their prey they advance\r\nrapidly by semi-circular strides, fixing one end firmly and arching the\r\nother forwards, till by successive advances they can lay hold of the\r\ntraveller's foot, when they disengage themselves from the ground and\r\nascend his dress in search of an aperture to enter. In these encounters\r\nthe individuals in the rear of a party of travellers in the jungle\r\ninvariably fare worst, as the leeches, once warned of their approach,\r\ncongregate with singular celerity. Their size is so insignificant, and\r\nthe wound they make is so skilfully punctured, that both are generally\r\nimperceptible, and the first intimation of their onslaught is the\r\ntrickling of the blood or a chill feeling of the leech when it begins to\r\nhang heavily on the skin from being distended by its repast. Horses are\r\ndriven wild by them, and stamp the ground in fury to shake them from\r\ntheir fetlocks, to which they hang in bloody tassels. The bare legs of\r\nthe palankin bearers and coolies are a favourite resort; and, as their\r\nhands are too much engaged to be spared to pull them off, the leeches\r\nhang like bunches of grapes round their ankles; and I have seen the\r\nblood literally flowing over the ledge of a European's shoe from their\r\ninnumerable bites. In healthy constitutions the wounds, if not\r\nirritated, generally heal, occasioning no other inconvenience than a\r\nslight inflammation and itching; but in those with a bad state of body,\r\nthe punctures, if rubbed, are liable to degenerate into ulcers, which\r\nmay lead to the loss of limb or even of life. Both Marshall and Davy\r\nmention, that during the march of troops in the mountains, when the\r\nKandyans were in rebellion, in 1818, the soldiers, and especially the\r\nMadras sepoys, with the pioneers and coolies, suffered so severely from\r\nthis cause that numbers perished.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Hæmadipsa Ceylanica_. Bose. Blainv. These pests are not,\r\nhowever, confined to Ceylon, they infest the lower ranges of the\r\nHimalaya.--HOOKER, vol. i. p. 107; vol. ii. p. 54. THUNBERG, who records\r\n(_Travels_, vol. iv. p. 232) having seen them in Ceylon, likewise met\r\nwith them in the forests and slopes of Batavia. MARSDEN (_Hist_. p. 311)\r\ncomplains of them dropping on travellers in Sumatra. KNORR found them at\r\nJapan; and it is affirmed that they abound in islands farther to the\r\neastward. M. GAY encountered them in Chili.--(MOQUIN-TANDON,\r\n_Hirudinées_, p. 211, 346). It is very doubtful, however, whether all\r\nthese are to be referred to one species. M. DE BLAINVILLE, under _H.\r\nCeylanica_, in the _Dict. de Scien. Nat_. vol. xlvii. p. 271, quotes M.\r\nBosc as authority for the kind, which that naturalist describes being\r\n\"rouges et tachetées;\" which is scarcely applicable to the Singhalese\r\nspecies. It is more than probable therefore, considering the period at\r\nwhich M. BOSC wrote, that he obtained his information from travellers to\r\nthe further east, and has connected with the habitat universally\r\nascribed to them from old KNOX'S work (Part 1. chap. vi.) a meagre\r\ndescription, more properly belonging to the land leech of Batavia or\r\nJapan. In all likelihood, therefore, there may be a _H. Boscii_,\r\ndistinct from the _H. Ceylanica_. That which is found in Ceylon is\r\nround, a little flattened on the inferior surface, largest at the anal\r\nextremity, thence gradually tapering forward, and with the anal sucker\r\ncomposed of four rings, and wider in proportion than in other species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EYES AND TEETH OF THE LAND LEECH OF CEYLON]\r\n\r\nIt is of a clear brown colour, with a yellow stripe the entire length of\r\neach side, and a greenish dorsal one. The body is formed of 100 rings;\r\nthe eyes, of which there are five pairs, are placed in an arch on the\r\ndorsal surface; the first four pairs occupying contiguous rings (thus\r\ndiffering from the water-leeches, which have an unoccupied ring betwixt\r\nthe third and fourth); the fifth pair are located on the seventh ring,\r\ntwo vacant rings intervening. To Mr. Thwaites, Director of the Botanic\r\nGarden at Peradenia, who at my request examined their structure\r\nminutely, I am indebted for the following most interesting particulars\r\nrespecting them. \"I have been giving a little time to the examination of\r\nthe land leech. I find it to have five pairs of ocelli, the first four\r\nseated on corresponding segments, and the posterior pair on the seventh\r\nsegment or ring, the fifth and sixth rings being eyeless (_fig_. A). The\r\nmouth is very retractile, and the aperture is shaped as in ordinary\r\nleeches. The serratures of the teeth, or rather the teeth themselves,\r\nare very beautiful. Each of the three 'teeth,' or cutting instruments,\r\nis principally muscular, the muscular body being very clearly seen. The\r\nrounded edge in which the teeth are set appears to be cartilaginous in\r\nstructure; the teeth are very numerous, (_fig_. B); but some near the\r\nbase have a curious appendage, apparently (I have not yet made this out\r\nquite satisfactorily) set upon one side. I have not yet been able to\r\ndetect the anal or sexual pores. The anal sucker seems to be formed of\r\nfour rings, and on each side above is a sort of crenated flesh-like\r\nappendage. The tint of the common species is yellowish-brown or\r\nsnuff-coloured, streaked with black, with a yellow-greenish dorsal, and\r\nanother lateral line along its whole length. There is a larger species\r\nto be found in this garden with a broad green dorsal fascia; but I have\r\nnot been able to procure one although I have offered a small reward to\r\nany coolie who will bring me one.\" In a subsequent communication Mr.\r\nThwaites remarks \"that the dorsal longitudinal fascia is of the same\r\nwidth as the lateral ones, and differs only in being perhaps slightly\r\nmore green; the colour of the three fasciæ varies from brownish-yellow\r\nto bright green.\" He likewise states \"that the rings which compose the\r\nbody are just 100, and the teeth 70 to 80 in each set, in a single row,\r\nexcept to one end, where they are in a double row.\"]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAND LEECHES IN PURSUIT]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Minorite friar, ODORIC of Portenau. writing in A.D.\r\n1320, says that the gem-finders who sought the jewels around Adam's\r\nPeak, \"take lemons which they peel, anointing themselves with the juice\r\nthereof, so that the leeches may not be able to hurt them.\"--HAKLUYT,\r\n_Voy._ vol. ii. p. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: DAVY'S _Ceylon_, p. 104; MARSHALL'S _Ceylon_, p. 15.]\r\n\r\nOne circumstance regarding these land leeches is remarkable and\r\nunexplained; they are helpless without moisture, and in the hills where\r\nthey abound at all other times, they entirely disappear during long\r\ndroughts;--yet re-appear instantaneously on the very first fall of rain;\r\nand in spots previously parched, where not one was visible an hour\r\nbefore, a single shower is sufficient to reproduce them in thousands,\r\nlurking beneath the decaying leaves, or striding with rapid movements\r\nacross the gravel. Whence do they re-appear? Do they, too, take a\r\n\"summer sleep,\" like the reptiles, molluscs, and tank fishes? or may\r\nthey, like the _Rotifera_, be dried up and preserved for an indefinite\r\nperiod, resuming their vital activity on the mere recurrence of\r\nmoisture?[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See an account of the _Rotifera_ and their faculty of\r\nrepeated vivifaction, in the note appended to this chapter.]\r\n\r\nBesides a species of the medicinal leech, which[1] is found in Ceylon,\r\nnearly double the size of the European one, and with a prodigious\r\nfaculty of engorging blood, there is another pest in the low country,\r\nwhich is a source of considerable annoyance, and often of loss, to the\r\nhusbandman. This is the cattle leech[2], which infests the stagnant\r\npools, chiefly in the alluvial lands around the base of the mountain\r\nzone, whither the cattle resort by day, and the wild animals by night,\r\nto quench their thirst and to bathe. Lurking amongst the rank vegetation\r\nthat fringes these deep pools, and hid by the broad leaves, or concealed\r\namong the stems and roots covered by the water, there are quantities of\r\nthese pests in wait to attack the animals on their approach to drink.\r\nTheir natural food consists of the juices of lumbrici and other\r\ninvertebrata; but they generally avail themselves of the opportunity\r\nafforded by the dipping of the muzzles of the animals in the water to\r\nfasten on their nostrils, and by degrees to make their way to the deeper\r\nrecesses of the nasal passages, and the mucous membranes of the throat\r\nand gullet. As many as a dozen have been found attached to the\r\nepiglottis and pharynx of a bullock, producing such irritation and\r\nsubmucous effusion that death has eventually ensued; and so tenacious\r\nare the leeches that even after death they retain their hold for some\r\nhours.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Hirudo sanguisorba_. The paddi-field leech of Ceylon, used\r\nfor surgical purposes, has the dorsal surface of blackish olive, with\r\nseveral longitudinal striæ, more or less defined; the crenated margin\r\nyellow. The ventral surface is fulvous, bordered laterally with olive;\r\nthe extreme margin yellow. The eyes are ranged as in the common\r\nmedicinal leech of Europe; the four anterior ones rather larger than the\r\nothers. The teeth are 140 in each series, appearing as a single row; in\r\nsize diminishing gradually from one end, very close set, and about half\r\nthe width of a tooth apart. When full grown, these leeches are about two\r\ninches long, but reaching to six inches when extended. Mr. Thwaites, to\r\nwhom I am indebted for these particulars, adds that he saw in a tank at\r\nKolona Korle leeches which appeared to him flatter and of a darker\r\ncolour than those described above, but that he had not an opportunity of\r\nexamining them particularly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DORSAL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VENTRAL.]\r\n\r\nMr. Thwaites states that there is a smaller tank leech of an olive-green\r\ncolour, with some indistinct longitudinal striæ on the upper surface;\r\nthe crenated margin of a pale yellowish-green; ocelli as in the\r\npaddi-field leech; length, one inch at rest, three inches when extended.\r\n\r\nMr. E.L. LAYARD informs us, _Mag. Nat. Hist_. p. 225, 1853, that a\r\nbubbling spring at the village of Tonniotoo, three miles S.W. of\r\nMoeletivoe, supplies most of the leeches used in the island. Those in\r\nuse at Colombo are obtained in the immediate vicinity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Hæmopsis paludum_. In size the cattle leech of Ceylon is\r\nsomewhat larger than the medicinal leech of Europe: in colour it is of a\r\nuniform brown without bands, unless a rufous margin may be so\r\nconsidered. It has dark striæ. The body is somewhat rounded, flat when\r\nswimming, and composed of rather more than ninety rings. The greatest\r\ndimension is a little in advance of the anal sucker; the body thence\r\ntapers to the other extremity, which ends in an upper lip projecting\r\nconsiderably beyond the mouth. The eyes, ten in number, are disposed as\r\nin the common leech. The mouth is oval, the biting apparatus with\r\ndifficulty seen, and the teeth not very numerous. The bite is so little\r\nacute that the moment of attachment, and the incision of the membrane is\r\nscarcely perceived by the sufferer from its attack.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Even men, when stooping to drink at a pool, are not safe\r\nfrom the assault of the cattle leeches. They cannot penetrate the human\r\nskin, but the delicate membrane of the mucous passages is easily\r\nruptured by their serrated jaws. Instances have come to my knowledge of\r\nEuropeans into whose nostrils they had gained admission and caused\r\nserious disturbance.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICULATA.\r\n\r\n_APTERA_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHYSANURA.\r\n\r\nPodura _albicollis_.\r\n  _atricollis_.\r\n  _viduata_.\r\n  _pilosa_.\r\n\r\nArchoreutes _coccinea_.\r\n\r\nLepisma nigrofasciara, _Temp_.\r\n  _nigra._\r\n\r\n\r\nARACHNIDA.\r\n\r\nButhus afer. _Linn_.\r\n  Ceylonicus, _Koch_.\r\n\r\nScorpio _linearis_.\r\n\r\nChelifer librorum.\r\n  _oblongus_.\r\n\r\nObisium _crassifemur_.\r\n\r\nPhrynus lunatus, _Pall_.\r\n\r\nThelyphonus caudatus, _Linn._\r\n\r\nPhalangium _bisignatum_.\r\n\r\nMygale fasciata, _Walck_.\r\n\r\nOlios taprobanius, _Walck_.\r\n\r\nNephila ... ?\r\n\r\nTrombidium tinctorum, _Herm_.\r\n\r\nOribata ... ?\r\n\r\nIxodes ... ?\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRIAPODA.\r\n\r\nCermatia _dispar_.\r\n\r\nLithobius _umbratilis_.\r\n\r\nScolopendra _crassa_.\r\n  spinosa, _Newp_.\r\n  _pallipes_.\r\n  _Grayii_? _Newp_.\r\n  tuberculidens, _Newp_.\r\n  Ceylonensis, _Newp_.\r\n  flava, _Newp_.\r\n  _olivacea_.\r\n  _abdominalis_,\r\n\r\nCryptops _sordidus_.\r\n  _assimilis_.\r\n\r\nGeophilus _tegularius_.\r\n  _speciosus_.\r\n\r\nJulus _ater_.\r\n  carnifex, _Fabr_.\r\n  _pallipes_.\r\n  _fiaviceps_.\r\n  _pallidus_.\r\n\r\nCraspedosoma _juloides_.\r\n  _præusta_.\r\n\r\nPolydesmus _granulatus_.\r\n\r\nCambala _catenulata_.\r\n\r\nZephronia _conspicua_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CRUSTACEA_.\r\n\r\nDECAPODA BHACHTUEA.\r\n\r\n_Polybius_.\r\n\r\nNeptunus pelagicus, _Linn._\r\n  sanguinolentus, _Herbst_.\r\n\r\nThalamlta ... ?\r\n\r\nThelphusa _Indica, Latr_.\r\n\r\n_Cardisoma_ ... ?\r\n\r\nOcypoda ceratophthalmus, _Pall_,\r\n  _macrocera, Edw_.\r\n\r\nGelasimus _tetragonon, Edw_.\r\n  _annulipes, Edw_.\r\n\r\nMacrophthalmus _carinimanus, Latr_.\r\n\r\nGrapsus _messor, Forsk_.\r\n  strigosus, _Herbst_.\r\n\r\nPlagusia depressa, _Fabr_.\r\n\r\nCalappa philargus, _Linn._\r\n  _tuberculata, Fabr_.\r\n\r\nMatota victor, _Fabr_.\r\n\r\nLeucosia _fugax, Fabr_.\r\n\r\n_Dorippe_.\r\n\r\nDECAPODA ANOMURA.\r\n\r\n_Dromia_ ... ?\r\n\r\nHippa Asiatica, _Edw_.\r\n\r\nPagurus affinis, _Edw_.\r\n  _punctulatus, Oliv_.\r\n\r\n_Porcellana_ ... ?\r\n\r\nDECAPODA MACRURA.\r\n\r\nScyllarus _orientalis, Fabr_.\r\n\r\nPalinurus ornatus, _Fabr_.\r\n  affinis, _N.S._\r\n\r\n_Crangon_ ... ?\r\n\r\n_Alpheus_ ... ?\r\n\r\nPomonia inflata, _Edw_.\r\n\r\nPalæmon carcinus, _Fabr_.\r\n\r\nSteaopus ... ?\r\n\r\nPeneus ...?\r\n\r\nSTOMATOPODA.\r\n\r\n_Squilla_ ... ?\r\n\r\nGonodactylus chiragra, _Fabr_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_CIRRHIPEDIA_.\r\n\r\n_Lepas_.\r\n\r\n_Balanus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ANNELIDA_.\r\n\r\nTubicolæ.\r\n\r\nDorsibranchiata.\r\n\r\nAbranchia.\r\n  Hirudo _sanguisorba_.\r\n    _Thwaitesii_.\r\n  Hæmopsis _paludum_.\r\n  Hæmadipsa Ceylana. _Blainv_.\r\n\r\nLumbricus ... ?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE\r\n\r\nON THE FACULTY OF REPEATED RE-VIVIFICATION POSSESSED BY THE _ROTIFERA_,\r\nETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Rotifer_, a singular creature, although it can only truly live in\r\nwater, inhabits the moss on house-tops, dying each time the sun dries up\r\nits place of retreat, to revive as often as a shower of rain supplies it\r\nwith the moisture essential to its existence; thus employing several\r\nyears to exhaust the eighteen days of life which nature has allotted to\r\nit. These creatures were discovered by LEUWENHOECK, and have become the\r\ntypes of a class already numerous, which undergo the same conditions of\r\nlife, and possess the same faculty. Besides the _Rotifera_, the\r\n_Tardigrades_, (which belong to the _Acari_,) and certain paste-eels,\r\nall exhibit a similar phenomenon. But although these different species\r\nmay die and be resuscitated several times in succession, this power has\r\nits limits, and each successive experiment generally proves fatal to one\r\nor more individuals. SPALLANZANI, in his experiments on the _Rotifera_,\r\ndid not find that any survived after the sixteenth alternation of\r\ndesiccation and damping, but paste-eels bore seventeen of those\r\nvicissitudes.\r\n\r\nSPALLANZANI, after thoroughly drying sand rich in _Rotifera_, kept it\r\nfor more than three years, moistening portions taken from it every five\r\nor six months. BAKER went further still in his experiments on\r\npaste-eels, for he kept the paste from which they had been taken,\r\nwithout moistening it in any way, for twenty-seven years, and at the end\r\nof that time the eels revived on being immersed in a drop of water. _If\r\nthey had exhausted their lives all at once and without these\r\nintermissions, these Rotifera and paste-eels would not have lived beyond\r\nsixteen or eighteen consecutive days._\r\n\r\nTo remove all doubt as to the complete desiccation of the animalcules\r\nexperimented on by SPALLANZANI and BAKER, M. DOYÈRE has published, in\r\nthe _Annales des Sciences Naturales_ for 1842, the results of his own\r\nobservation, in cases in which the mosses containing the insects were\r\ndried under the receiver of an air-pump and left there for a week; after\r\nwhich they were placed in a stove heated to 267° Fahr., and yet, when\r\nagain immersed in water, a number of the _Rotifera_ became as lively as\r\never.\r\n\r\nFurther particulars of these experiments will be found in the Appendix\r\nto the _Rambles of a Naturalist, &c._, by M. QUARTREFAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nABOU-ZEYD, his account of fish on dry land, 350 n.\r\nAbyssinia, fishes of, 352.\r\n_Acalephæ_, 398. _See_
