THOMPSON\r\n\r\nUniversity of Chicago Press\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nI wrote this Treatise during my sojourn in France twelve years ago,\r\nand I communicated it in the year 1678 to the learned persons who then\r\ncomposed the Royal Academy of Science, to the membership of which the\r\nKing had done me the honour of calling, me. Several of that body who\r\nare still alive will remember having been present when I read it, and\r\nabove the rest those amongst them who applied themselves particularly\r\nto the study of Mathematics; of whom I cannot cite more than the\r\ncelebrated gentlemen Cassini, Römer, and De la Hire. And, although I\r\nhave since corrected and changed some parts, the copies which I had\r\nmade of it at that time may serve for proof that I have yet added\r\nnothing to it save some conjectures touching the formation of Iceland\r\nCrystal, and a novel observation on the refraction of Rock Crystal. I\r\nhave desired to relate these particulars to make known how long I have\r\nmeditated the things which now I publish, and not for the purpose of\r\ndetracting from the merit of those who, without having seen anything\r\nthat I have written, may be found to have treated of like matters: as\r\nhas in fact occurred to two eminent Geometricians, Messieurs Newton\r\nand Leibnitz, with respect to the Problem of the figure of glasses for\r\ncollecting rays when one of the surfaces is given.\r\n\r\nOne may ask why I have so long delayed to bring this work to the\r\nlight. The reason is that I wrote it rather carelessly in the Language\r\nin which it appears, with the intention of translating it into Latin,\r\nso doing in order to obtain greater attention to the thing. After\r\nwhich I proposed to myself to give it out along with another Treatise\r\non Dioptrics, in which I explain the effects of Telescopes and those\r\nthings which belong more to that Science. But the pleasure of novelty\r\nbeing past, I have put off from time to time the execution of this\r\ndesign, and I know not when I shall ever come to an end if it, being\r\noften turned aside either by business or by some new study.\r\nConsidering which I have finally judged that it was better worth while\r\nto publish this writing, such as it is, than to let it run the risk,\r\nby waiting longer, of remaining lost.\r\n\r\nThere will be seen in it demonstrations of those kinds which do not\r\nproduce as great a certitude as those of Geometry, and which even\r\ndiffer much therefrom, since whereas the Geometers prove their\r\nPropositions by fixed and incontestable Principles, here the\r\nPrinciples are verified by the conclusions to be drawn from them; the\r\nnature of these things not allowing of this being done otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt is always possible to attain thereby to a degree of probability\r\nwhich very often is scarcely less than complete proof. To wit, when\r\nthings which have been demonstrated by the Principles that have been\r\nassumed correspond perfectly to the phenomena which experiment has\r\nbrought under observation; especially when there are a great number of\r\nthem, and further, principally, when one can imagine and foresee new\r\nphenomena which ought to follow from the hypotheses which one employs,\r\nand when one finds that therein the fact corresponds to our prevision.\r\nBut if all these proofs of probability are met with in that which I\r\npropose to discuss, as it seems to me they are, this ought to be a\r\nvery strong confirmation of the success of my inquiry; and it must be\r\nill if the facts are not pretty much as I represent them. I would\r\nbelieve then that those who love to know the Causes of things and who\r\nare able to admire the marvels of Light, will find some satisfaction\r\nin these various speculations regarding it, and in the new explanation\r\nof its famous property which is the main foundation of the\r\nconstruction of our eyes and of those great inventions which extend so\r\nvastly the use of them.\r\n\r\nI hope also that there will be some who by following these beginnings\r\nwill penetrate much further into this question than I have been able\r\nto do, since the subject must be far from being exhausted. This\r\nappears from the passages which I have indicated where I leave certain\r\ndifficulties without having resolved them, and still more from matters\r\nwhich I have not touched at all, such as Luminous Bodies of several\r\nsorts, and all that concerns Colours; in which no one until now can\r\nboast of having succeeded. Finally, there remains much more to be\r\ninvestigated touching the nature of Light which I do not pretend to\r\nhave disclosed, and I shall owe much in return to him who shall be\r\nable to supplement that which is here lacking to me in knowledge. The\r\nHague. The 8 January 1690.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE BY THE TRANSLATOR\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the great influence which this Treatise has exercised in\r\nthe development of the Science of Optics, it seems strange that two\r\ncenturies should have passed before an English edition of the work\r\nappeared. Perhaps the circumstance is due to the mistaken zeal with\r\nwhich formerly everything that conflicted with the cherished ideas of\r\nNewton was denounced by his followers. The Treatise on Light of\r\nHuygens has, however, withstood the test of time: and even now the\r\nexquisite skill with which he applied his conception of the\r\npropagation of waves of light to unravel the intricacies of the\r\nphenomena of the double refraction of crystals, and of the refraction\r\nof the atmosphere, will excite the admiration of the student of\r\nOptics. It is true that his wave theory was far from the complete\r\ndoctrine as subsequently developed by Thomas Young and Augustin\r\nFresnel, and belonged rather to geometrical than to physical Optics.\r\nIf Huygens had no conception of transverse vibrations, of the\r\nprinciple of interference, or of the existence of the ordered sequence\r\nof waves in trains, he nevertheless attained to a remarkably clear\r\nunderstanding of the principles of wave-propagation; and his\r\nexposition of the subject marks an epoch in the treatment of Optical\r\nproblems. It has been needful in preparing this translation to\r\nexercise care lest one should import into the author's text ideas of\r\nsubsequent date, by using words that have come to imply modern\r\nconceptions. Hence the adoption of as literal a rendering as possible.\r\nA few of the author's terms need explanation. He uses the word\r\n\"refraction,\" for example, both for the phenomenon or process usually\r\nso denoted, and for the result of that process: thus the refracted ray\r\nhe habitually terms \"the refraction\" of the incident ray. When a\r\nwave-front, or, as he terms it, a \"wave,\" has passed from some initial\r\nposition to a subsequent one, he terms the wave-front in its\r\nsubsequent position \"the continuation\" of the wave. He also speaks of\r\nthe envelope of a set of elementary waves, formed by coalescence of\r\nthose elementary wave-fronts, as \"the termination\" of the wave; and\r\nthe elementary wave-fronts he terms \"particular\" waves. Owing to the\r\ncircumstance that the French word _rayon_ possesses the double\r\nsignification of ray of light and radius of a circle, he avoids its\r\nuse in the latter sense and speaks always of the semi-diameter, not of\r\nthe radius. His speculations as to the ether, his suggestive views of\r\nthe structure of crystalline bodies, and his explanation of opacity,\r\nslight as they are, will possibly surprise the reader by their seeming\r\nmodernness. And none can read his investigation of the phenomena found\r\nin Iceland spar without marvelling at his insight and sagacity.\r\n\r\nS.P.T.\r\n\r\nJune, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF MATTERS\r\n\r\nContained in this Treatise\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\nOn Rays Propagated in Straight Lines.\r\n\r\n  That Light is produced by a certain movement.\r\n\r\n  That no substance passes from the luminous object to the eyes.\r\n\r\n  That Light spreads spherically, almost as Sound does.\r\n\r\n  Whether Light takes time to spread.\r\n\r\n  Experience seeming to prove that it passes instantaneously.\r\n\r\n  Experience proving that it takes time.\r\n\r\n  How much its speed is greater than that of Sound.\r\n\r\n  In what the emission of Light differs from that of Sound.\r\n\r\n  That it is not the same medium which serves for Light and Sound.\r\n\r\n  How Sound is propagated.\r\n\r\n  How Light is propagated.\r\n\r\n  Detailed Remarks on the propagation of Light.\r\n\r\n  Why Rays are propagated only in straight lines.\r\n\r\n  How Light coming in different directions can cross itself.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\nOn Reflexion.\r\n\r\n  Demonstration of equality of angles of incidence and reflexion.\r\n\r\n  Why the incident and reflected rays are in the same plane\r\n  perpendicular to the reflecting surface.\r\n\r\n  That it is not needful for the reflecting surface to be perfectly\r\n  flat to attain equality of the angles of incidence and reflexion.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\nOn Refraction.\r\n\r\n  That bodies may be transparent without any substance passing through\r\n  them.\r\n\r\n  Proof that the ethereal matter passes through transparent bodies.\r\n\r\n  How this matter passing through can render them transparent.\r\n\r\n  That the most solid bodies in appearance are of a very loose texture.\r\n\r\n  That Light spreads more slowly in water and in glass than in air.\r\n\r\n  Third hypothesis to explain transparency, and the retardation which\r\n  Light suffers.\r\n\r\n  On that which makes bodies opaque.\r\n\r\n  Demonstration why Refraction obeys the known proportion of Sines.\r\n\r\n  Why the incident and refracted Rays produce one another reciprocally.\r\n\r\n  Why Reflexion within a triangular glass prism is suddenly augmented\r\n  when the Light can no longer penetrate.\r\n\r\n  That bodies which cause greater Refraction also cause stronger\r\n  Reflexion.\r\n\r\n  Demonstration of the Theorem of Mr. Fermat.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\nOn the Refraction of the Air.\r\n\r\n  That the emanations of Light in the air are not spherical.\r\n\r\n  How consequently some objects appear higher than they are.\r\n\r\n  How the Sun may appear on the Horizon before he has risen.\r\n\r\n  That the rays of light become curved in the Air of the Atmosphere,\r\n  and what effects this produces.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\nOn the Strange Refraction of Iceland Crystal.\r\n\r\n  That this Crystal grows also in other countries.\r\n\r\n  Who first-wrote about it.\r\n\r\n  Description of Iceland Crystal;

Such are that the rays of light are propagated in straight\r\nlines; that the angles of reflexion and of incidence are equal; and\r\nthat in refraction the ray is bent according to the law of sines, now\r\nso well known, and which is no less certain than the preceding laws.\r\n\r\nThe majority of those who have written touching the various parts of\r\nOptics have contented themselves with presuming these truths. But\r\nsome, more inquiring, have desired to investigate the origin and the\r\ncauses, considering these to be in themselves wonderful effects of\r\nNature. In which they advanced some ingenious things, but not however\r\nsuch that the most intelligent folk do not wish for better and more\r\nsatisfactory explanations. Wherefore I here desire to propound what I\r\nhave meditated on the subject, so as to contribute as much as I can\r\nto the explanation of this department of Natural Science, which, not\r\nwithout reason, is reputed to be one of its most difficult parts. I\r\nrecognize myself to be much indebted to those who were the first to\r\nbegin to dissipate the strange obscurity in which these things were\r\nenveloped, and to give us hope that they might be explained by\r\nintelligible reasoning. But, on the other hand I am astonished also\r\nthat even here these have often been willing to offer, as assured and\r\ndemonstrative, reasonings which were far from conclusive. For I do not\r\nfind that any one has yet given a probable explanation of the first\r\nand most notable phenomena of light, namely why it is not propagated\r\nexcept in straight lines, and how visible rays, coming from an\r\ninfinitude of diverse places, cross one another without hindering one\r\nanother in any way.\r\n\r\nI shall therefore essay in this book, to give, in accordance with the\r\nprinciples accepted in the Philosophy of the present day, some clearer\r\nand more probable reasons, firstly of these properties of light\r\npropagated rectilinearly; secondly of light which is reflected on\r\nmeeting other bodies. Then I shall explain the phenomena of those rays\r\nwhich are said to suffer refraction on passing through transparent\r\nbodies of different sorts; and in this part I shall also explain the\r\neffects of the refraction of the air by the different densities of the\r\nAtmosphere.\r\n\r\nThereafter I shall examine the causes of the strange refraction of a\r\ncertain kind of Crystal which is brought from Iceland. And finally I\r\nshall treat of the various shapes of transparent and reflecting bodies\r\nby which rays are collected at a point or are turned aside in various\r\nways. From this it will be seen with what facility, following our new\r\nTheory, we find not only the Ellipses, Hyperbolas, and other curves\r\nwhich Mr. Des Cartes has ingeniously invented for this purpose; but\r\nalso those which the surface of a glass lens ought to possess when its\r\nother surface is given as spherical or plane, or of any other figure\r\nthat may be.\r\n\r\nIt is inconceivable to doubt that light consists in the motion of some\r\nsort of matter. For whether one considers its production, one sees\r\nthat here upon the Earth it is chiefly engendered by fire and flame\r\nwhich contain without doubt bodies that are in rapid motion, since\r\nthey dissolve and melt many other bodies, even the most solid; or\r\nwhether one considers its effects, one sees that when light is\r\ncollected, as by concave mirrors, it has the property of burning as a\r\nfire does, that is to say it disunites the particles of bodies. This\r\nis assuredly the mark of motion, at least in the true Philosophy, in\r\nwhich one conceives the causes of all natural effects in terms of\r\nmechanical motions. This, in my opinion, we must necessarily do, or\r\nelse renounce all hopes of ever comprehending anything in Physics.\r\n\r\nAnd as, according to this Philosophy, one holds as certain that the\r\nsensation of sight is excited only by the impression of some movement\r\nof a kind of matter which acts on the nerves at the back of our eyes,\r\nthere is here yet one reason more for believing that light consists in\r\na movement of the matter which exists between us and the luminous\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nFurther, when one considers the extreme speed with which light spreads\r\non every side, and how, when it comes from different regions, even\r\nfrom those directly opposite, the rays traverse one another without\r\nhindrance, one may well understand that when we see a luminous object,\r\nit cannot be by any transport of matter coming to us from this object,\r\nin the way in which a shot or an arrow traverses the air; for\r\nassuredly that would too greatly impugn these two properties of light,\r\nespecially the second of them. It is then in some other way that light\r\nspreads; and that which can lead us to comprehend it is the knowledge\r\nwhich we have of the spreading of Sound in the air.\r\n\r\nWe know that by means of the air, which is an invisible and impalpable\r\nbody, Sound spreads around the spot where it has been produced, by a\r\nmovement which is passed on successively from one part of the air to\r\nanother; and that the spreading of this movement, taking place equally\r\nrapidly on all sides, ought to form spherical surfaces ever enlarging\r\nand which strike our ears. Now there is no doubt at all that light\r\nalso comes from the luminous body to our eyes by some movement\r\nimpressed on the matter which is between the two; since, as we have\r\nalready seen, it cannot be by the transport of a body which passes\r\nfrom one to the other. If, in addition, light takes time for its\r\npassage--which we are now going to examine--it will follow that this\r\nmovement, impressed on the intervening matter, is successive; and\r\nconsequently it spreads, as Sound does, by spherical surfaces and\r\nwaves: for I call them waves from their resemblance to those which are\r\nseen to be formed in water when a stone is thrown into it, and which\r\npresent a successive spreading as circles, though these arise from\r\nanother cause, and are only in a flat surface.\r\n\r\nTo see then whether the spreading of light takes time, let us consider\r\nfirst whether there are any facts of experience which can convince us\r\nto the contrary. As to those which can be made here on the Earth, by\r\nstriking lights at great distances, although they prove that light\r\ntakes no sensible time to pass over these distances, one may say with\r\ngood reason that they are too small, and that the only conclusion to\r\nbe drawn from them is that the passage of light is extremely rapid.\r\nMr. Des Cartes, who was of opinion that it is instantaneous, founded\r\nhis views, not without reason, upon a better basis of experience,\r\ndrawn from the Eclipses of the Moon; which, nevertheless, as I shall\r\nshow, is not at all convincing. I will set it forth, in a way a little\r\ndifferent from his, in order to make the conclusion more\r\ncomprehensible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet A be the place of the sun, BD a part of the orbit or annual path\r\nof the Earth: ABC a straight line which I suppose to meet the orbit of\r\nthe Moon, which is represented by the circle CD, at C.\r\n\r\nNow if light requires time, for example one hour, to traverse the\r\nspace which is between the Earth and the Moon, it will follow that the\r\nEarth having arrived at B, the shadow which it casts, or the\r\ninterruption of the light, will not yet have arrived at the point C,\r\nbut will only arrive there an hour after. It will then be one hour\r\nafter, reckoning from the moment when the Earth was at B, that the\r\nMoon, arriving at C, will be obscured: but this obscuration or\r\ninterruption of the light will not reach the Earth till after another\r\nhour. Let us suppose that the Earth in these two hours will have\r\narrived at E. The Earth then, being at E, will see the Eclipsed Moon\r\nat C, which it left an hour before, and at the same time will see the\r\nsun at A. For it being immovable, as I suppose with Copernicus, and\r\nthe light moving always in straight lines, it must always appear where\r\nit is. But one has always observed, we are told, that the eclipsed\r\nMoon appears at the point of the Ecliptic opposite to the Sun; and yet\r\nhere it would appear in arrear of that point by an amount equal to the\r\nangle GEC, the supplement of AEC. This, however, is contrary to\r\nexperience, since the angle GEC would be very sensible, and about 33\r\ndegrees. Now according to our computation, which is given in the\r\nTreatise on the causes of the phenomena of Saturn, the distance BA\r\nbetween the Earth and the Sun is about twelve thousand diameters of\r\nthe Earth, and hence four hundred times greater than BC the distance\r\nof the Moon, which is 30 diameters. Then the angle ECB will be nearly\r\nfour hundred times greater than BAE, which is five minutes; namely,\r\nthe path which the earth travels in two hours along its orbit; and\r\nthus the angle BCE will be nearly 33 degrees; and likewise the angle\r\nCEG, which is greater by five minutes.\r\n\r\nBut it must be noted that the speed of light in this argument has been\r\nassumed such that it takes a time of one hour to make the passage from\r\nhere to the Moon. If one supposes that for this it requires only one\r\nminute of time, then it is manifest that the angle CEG will only be 33\r\nminutes; and if it requires only ten seconds of time, the angle will\r\nbe less than six minutes. And then it will not be easy to perceive\r\nanything of it in observations of the Eclipse; nor, consequently, will\r\nit be permissible to deduce from it that the movement of light is\r\ninstantaneous.\r\n\r\nIt is true that we are here supposing a strange velocity that would be\r\na hundred thousand times greater than that of Sound. For Sound,\r\naccording to what I have observed, travels about 180 Toises in the\r\ntime of one Second, or in about one beat of the pulse. But this\r\nsupposition ought not to seem to be an impossibility; since it is not\r\na question of the transport of a body with so great a speed, but of a\r\nsuccessive movement which is passed on from some bodies to others. I\r\nhave then made no difficulty, in meditating on these things, in\r\nsupposing that the emanation of light is accomplished with time,\r\nseeing that in this way all its phenomena can be explained, and that\r\nin following the contrary opinion everything is incomprehensible. For\r\nit has always seemed tome that even Mr. Des Cartes, whose aim has been\r\nto treat all the subjects of Physics intelligibly, and who assuredly\r\nhas succeeded in this better than any one before him, has said nothing\r\nthat is not full of difficulties, or even inconceivable, in dealing\r\nwith Light and its properties.\r\n\r\nBut that which I employed only as a hypothesis, has recently received\r\ngreat seemingness as an established truth by the ingenious proof of\r\nMr. Römer which I am going here to relate, expecting him himself to\r\ngive all that is needed for its confirmation. It is founded as is the\r\npreceding argument upon celestial observations, and proves not only\r\nthat Light takes time for its passage, but also demonstrates how much\r\ntime it takes, and that its velocity is even at least six times\r\ngreater than that which I have just stated.\r\n\r\nFor this he makes use of the Eclipses suffered by the little planets\r\nwhich revolve around Jupiter, and which often enter his shadow: and\r\nsee what is his reasoning. Let A be the Sun, BCDE the annual orbit of\r\nthe Earth, F Jupiter, GN the orbit of the nearest of his Satellites,\r\nfor it is this one which is more apt for this investigation than any\r\nof the other three, because of the quickness of its revolution. Let G\r\nbe this Satellite entering into the shadow of Jupiter, H the same\r\nSatellite emerging from the shadow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet it be then supposed, the Earth being at B some time before the\r\nlast quadrature, that one has seen the said Satellite emerge from the\r\nshadow; it must needs be, if the Earth remains at the same place,\r\nthat, after 42-1/2 hours, one would again see a similar emergence,\r\nbecause that is the time in which it makes the round of its orbit, and\r\nwhen it would come again into opposition to the Sun. And if the Earth,\r\nfor instance, were to remain always at B during 30 revolutions of this\r\nSatellite, one would see it again emerge from the shadow after 30\r\ntimes 42-1/2 hours. But the Earth having been carried along during\r\nthis time to C, increasing thus its distance from Jupiter, it follows\r\nthat if Light requires time for its passage the illumination of the\r\nlittle planet will be perceived later at C than it would have been at\r\nB, and that there must be added to this time of 30 times 42-1/2 hours\r\nthat which the Light has required to traverse the space MC, the\r\ndifference of the spaces CH, BH. Similarly at the other quadrature\r\nwhen the earth has come to E from D while approaching toward Jupiter,\r\nthe immersions of the Satellite ought to be observed at E earlier than\r\nthey would have been seen if the Earth had remained at D.\r\n\r\nNow in quantities of observations of these Eclipses, made during ten\r\nconsecutive years, these differences have been found to be very\r\nconsiderable, such as ten minutes and more; and from them it has been\r\nconcluded that in order to traverse the whole diameter of the annual\r\norbit KL, which is double the distance from here to the sun, Light\r\nrequires about 22 minutes of time.\r\n\r\nThe movement of Jupiter in his orbit while the Earth passed from B to\r\nC, or from D to E, is included in this calculation; and this makes it\r\nevident that one cannot attribute the retardation of these\r\nilluminations or the anticipation of the eclipses, either to any\r\nirregularity occurring in the movement of the little planet or to its\r\neccentricity.\r\n\r\nIf one considers the vast size of the diameter KL, which according to\r\nme is some 24 thousand diameters of the Earth, one will acknowledge\r\nthe extreme velocity of Light. For, supposing that KL is no more than\r\n22 thousand of these diameters, it appears that being traversed in 22\r\nminutes this makes the speed a thousand diameters in one minute, that\r\nis 16-2/3 diameters in one second or in one beat of the pulse, which\r\nmakes more than 11 hundred times a hundred thousand toises; since the\r\ndiameter of the Earth contains 2,865 leagues, reckoned at 25 to the\r\ndegree, and each each league is 2,282 Toises, according to the exact\r\nmeasurement which Mr. Picard made by order of the King in 1669. But\r\nSound, as I have said above, only travels 180 toises in the same time\r\nof one second: hence the velocity of Light is more than six hundred\r\nthousand times greater than that of Sound. This, however, is quite\r\nanother thing from being instantaneous, since there is all the\r\ndifference between a finite thing and an infinite. Now the successive\r\nmovement of Light being confirmed in this way, it follows, as I have\r\nsaid, that it spreads by spherical waves, like the movement of Sound.\r\n\r\nBut if the one resembles the other in this respect, they differ in\r\nmany other things; to wit, in the first production of the movement\r\nwhich causes them; in the matter in which the movement spreads; and in\r\nthe manner in which it is propagated. As to that which occurs in the\r\nproduction of Sound, one knows that it is occasioned by the agitation\r\nundergone by an entire body, or by a considerable part of one, which\r\nshakes all the contiguous air. But the movement of the Light must\r\noriginate as from each point of the luminous object, else we should\r\nnot be able to perceive all the different parts of that object, as\r\nwill be more evident in that which follows. And I do not believe that\r\nthis movement can be better explained than by supposing that all those\r\nof the luminous bodies which are liquid, such as flames, and\r\napparently the sun and the stars, are composed of particles which\r\nfloat in a much more subtle medium which agitates them with great\r\nrapidity, and makes them strike against the particles of the ether\r\nwhich surrounds them, and which are much smaller than they. But I hold\r\nalso that in luminous solids such as charcoal or metal made red hot in\r\nthe fire, this same movement is caused by the violent agitation of\r\nthe particles of the metal or of the wood; those of them which are on\r\nthe surface striking similarly against the ethereal matter. The\r\nagitation, moreover, of the particles which engender the light ought\r\nto be much more prompt and more rapid than is that of the bodies which\r\ncause sound, since we do not see that the tremors of a body which is\r\ngiving out a sound are capable of giving rise to Light, even as the\r\nmovement of the hand in the air is not capable of producing Sound.\r\n\r\nNow if one examines what this matter may be in which the movement\r\ncoming from the luminous body is propagated, which I call Ethereal\r\nmatter, one will see that it is not the same that serves for the\r\npropagation of Sound. For one finds that the latter is really that\r\nwhich we feel and which we breathe, and which being removed from any\r\nplace still leaves there the other kind of matter that serves to\r\nconvey Light. This may be proved by shutting up a sounding body in a\r\nglass vessel from which the air is withdrawn by the machine which Mr.\r\nBoyle has given us, and with which he has performed so many beautiful\r\nexperiments. But in doing this of which I speak, care must be taken to\r\nplace the sounding body on cotton or on feathers, in such a way that\r\nit cannot communicate its tremors either to the glass vessel which\r\nencloses it, or to the machine; a precaution which has hitherto been\r\nneglected. For then after having exhausted all the air one hears no\r\nSound from the metal, though it is struck.\r\n\r\nOne sees here not only that our air, which does not penetrate through\r\nglass, is the matter by which Sound spreads; but also that it is not\r\nthe same air but another kind of matter in which Light spreads; since\r\nif the air is removed from the vessel the Light does not cease to\r\ntraverse it as before.\r\n\r\nAnd this last point is demonstrated even more clearly by the\r\ncelebrated experiment of Torricelli, in which the tube of glass from\r\nwhich the quicksilver has withdrawn itself, remaining void of air,\r\ntransmits Light just the same as when air is in it. For this proves\r\nthat a matter different from air exists in this tube, and that this\r\nmatter must have penetrated the glass or the quicksilver, either one\r\nor the other, though they are both impenetrable to the air. And when,\r\nin the same experiment, one makes the vacuum after putting a little\r\nwater above the quicksilver, one concludes equally that the said\r\nmatter passes through glass or water, or through both.\r\n\r\nAs regards the different modes in which I have said the movements of\r\nSound and of Light are communicated, one may sufficiently comprehend\r\nhow this occurs in the case of Sound if one considers that the air is\r\nof such a nature that it can be compressed and reduced to a much\r\nsmaller space than that which it ordinarily occupies. And in\r\nproportion as it is compressed the more does it exert an effort to\r\nregain its volume; for this property along with its penetrability,\r\nwhich remains notwithstanding its compression, seems to prove that it\r\nis made up of small bodies which float about and which are agitated\r\nvery rapidly in the ethereal matter composed of much smaller parts. So\r\nthat the cause of the spreading of Sound is the effort which these\r\nlittle bodies make in collisions with one another, to regain freedom\r\nwhen they are a little more squeezed together in the circuit of these\r\nwaves than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut the extreme velocity of Light, and other properties which it has,\r\ncannot admit of such a propagation of motion, and I am about to show\r\nhere the way in which I conceive it must occur. For this, it is\r\nneedful to explain the property which hard bodies must possess to\r\ntransmit movement from one to another.\r\n\r\nWhen one takes a number of spheres of equal size, made of some very\r\nhard substance, and arranges them in a straight line, so that they\r\ntouch one another, one finds, on striking with a similar sphere\r\nagainst the first of these spheres, that the motion passes as in an\r\ninstant to the last of them, which separates itself from the row,\r\nwithout one's being able to perceive that the others have been\r\nstirred. And even that one which was used to strike remains motionless\r\nwith them. Whence one sees that the movement passes with an extreme\r\nvelocity which is the greater, the greater the hardness of the\r\nsubstance of the spheres.\r\n\r\nBut it is still certain that this progression of motion is not\r\ninstantaneous, but successive, and therefore must take time. For if\r\nthe movement, or the disposition to movement, if you will have it so,\r\ndid not pass successively through all these spheres, they would all\r\nacquire the movement at the same time, and hence would all advance\r\ntogether; which does not happen. For the last one leaves the whole row\r\nand acquires the speed of the one which was pushed. Moreover there are\r\nexperiments which demonstrate that all the bodies which we reckon of\r\nthe hardest kind, such as quenched steel, glass, and agate, act as\r\nsprings and bend somehow, not only when extended as rods but also when\r\nthey are in the form of spheres or of other shapes. That is to say\r\nthey yield a little in themselves at the place where they are struck,\r\nand immediately regain their former figure. For I have found that on\r\nstriking with a ball of glass or of agate against a large and quite\r\nthick thick piece of the same substance which had a flat surface,\r\nslightly soiled with breath or in some other way, there remained round\r\nmarks, of smaller or larger size according as the blow had been weak\r\nor strong. This makes it evident that these substances yield where\r\nthey meet, and spring back: and for this time must be required.\r\n\r\nNow in applying this kind of movement to that which produces Light\r\nthere is nothing to hinder us from estimating the particles of the\r\nether to be of a substance as nearly approaching to perfect hardness\r\nand possessing a springiness as prompt as we choose. It is not\r\nnecessary to examine here the causes of this hardness, or of that\r\nspringiness, the consideration of which would lead us too far from our\r\nsubject. I will say, however, in passing that we may conceive that the\r\nparticles of the ether, notwithstanding their smallness, are in turn\r\ncomposed of other parts and that their springiness consists in the\r\nvery rapid movement of a subtle matter which penetrates them from\r\nevery side and constrains their structure to assume such a disposition\r\nas to give to this fluid matter the most overt and easy passage\r\npossible. This accords with the explanation which Mr. Des Cartes gives\r\nfor the spring, though I do not, like him, suppose the pores to be in\r\nthe form of round hollow canals. And it must not be thought that in\r\nthis there is anything absurd or impossible, it being on the contrary\r\nquite credible that it is this infinite series of different sizes of\r\ncorpuscles, having different degrees of velocity, of which Nature\r\nmakes use to produce so many marvellous effects.\r\n\r\nBut though we shall ignore the true cause of springiness we still see\r\nthat there are many bodies which possess this property; and thus there\r\nis nothing strange in supposing that it exists also in little\r\ninvisible bodies like the particles of the Ether. Also if one wishes\r\nto seek for any other way in which the movement of Light is\r\nsuccessively communicated, one will find none which agrees better,\r\nwith uniform progression, as seems to be necessary, than the property\r\nof springiness; because if this movement should grow slower in\r\nproportion as it is shared over a greater quantity of matter, in\r\nmoving away from the source of the light, it could not conserve this\r\ngreat velocity over great distances. But by supposing springiness in\r\nthe ethereal matter, its particles will have the property of equally\r\nrapid restitution whether they are pushed strongly or feebly; and thus\r\nthe propagation of Light will always go on with an equal velocity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd it must be known that although the particles of the ether are not\r\nranged thus in straight lines, as in our row of spheres, but\r\nconfusedly, so that one of them touches several others, this does not\r\nhinder them from transmitting their movement and from spreading it\r\nalways forward. As to this it is to be remarked that there is a law of\r\nmotion serving for this propagation, and verifiable by experiment. It\r\nis that when a sphere, such as A here, touches several other similar\r\nspheres CCC, if it is struck by another sphere B in such a way as to\r\nexert an impulse against all the spheres CCC which touch it, it\r\ntransmits to them the whole of its movement, and remains after that\r\nmotionless like the sphere B. And without supposing that the ethereal\r\nparticles are of spherical form (for I see indeed no need to suppose\r\nthem so) one may well understand that this property of communicating\r\nan impulse does not fail to contribute to the aforesaid propagation\r\nof movement.\r\n\r\nEquality of size seems to be more necessary, because otherwise there\r\nought to be some reflexion of movement backwards when it passes from a\r\nsmaller particle to a larger one, according to the Laws of Percussion\r\nwhich I published some years ago.\r\n\r\nHowever, one will see hereafter that we have to suppose such an\r\nequality not so much as a necessity for the propagation of light as\r\nfor rendering that propagation easier and more powerful; for it is not\r\nbeyond the limits of probability that the particles of the ether have\r\nbeen made equal for a purpose so important as that of light, at least\r\nin that vast space which is beyond the region of atmosphere and which\r\nseems to serve only to transmit the light of the Sun and the Stars.\r\n\r\nI have then shown in what manner one may conceive Light to spread\r\nsuccessively, by spherical waves, and how it is possible that this\r\nspreading is accomplished with as great a velocity as that which\r\nexperiments and celestial observations demand. Whence it may be\r\nfurther remarked that although the particles are supposed to be in\r\ncontinual movement (for there are many reasons for this) the\r\nsuccessive propagation of the waves cannot be hindered by this;\r\nbecause the propagation consists nowise in the transport of those\r\nparticles but merely in a small agitation which they cannot help\r\ncommunicating to those surrounding, notwithstanding any movement which\r\nmay act on them causing them to be changing positions amongst\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nBut we must consider still more particularly the origin of these\r\nwaves, and the manner in which they spread. And, first, it follows\r\nfrom what has been said on the production of Light, that each little\r\nregion of a luminous body, such as the Sun, a candle, or a burning\r\ncoal, generates its own waves of which that region is the centre. Thus\r\nin the flame of a candle, having distinguished the points A, B, C,\r\nconcentric circles described about each of these points represent the\r\nwaves which come from them. And one must imagine the same about every\r\npoint of the surface and of the part within the flame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut as the percussions at the centres of these waves possess no\r\nregular succession, it must not be supposed that the waves themselves\r\nfollow one another at equal distances: and if the distances marked in\r\nthe figure appear to be such, it is rather to mark the progression of\r\none and the same wave at equal intervals of time than to represent\r\nseveral of them issuing from one and the same centre.\r\n\r\nAfter all, this prodigious quantity of waves which traverse one\r\nanother without confusion and without effacing one another must not be\r\ndeemed inconceivable; it being certain that one and the same particle\r\nof matter can serve for many waves coming from different sides or even\r\nfrom contrary directions, not only if it is struck by blows which\r\nfollow one another closely but even for those which act on it at the\r\nsame instant. It can do so because the spreading of the movement is\r\nsuccessive. This may be proved by the row of equal spheres of hard\r\nmatter, spoken of above. If against this row there are pushed from two\r\nopposite sides at the same time two similar spheres A and D, one will\r\nsee each of them rebound with the same velocity which it had in\r\nstriking, yet the whole row will remain in its place, although the\r\nmovement has passed along its whole length twice over. And if these\r\ncontrary movements happen to meet one another at the middle sphere, B,\r\nor at some other such as C, that sphere will yield and act as a spring\r\nat both sides, and so will serve at the same instant to transmit these\r\ntwo movements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut what may at first appear full strange and even incredible is that\r\nthe undulations produced by such small movements and corpuscles,\r\nshould spread to such immense distances; as for example from the Sun\r\nor from the Stars to us. For the force of these waves must grow feeble\r\nin proportion as they move away from their origin, so that the action\r\nof each one in particular will without doubt become incapable of\r\nmaking itself felt to our sight. But one will cease to be astonished\r\nby considering how at a great distance from the luminous body an\r\ninfinitude of waves, though they have issued from different points of\r\nthis body, unite together in such a way that they sensibly compose one\r\nsingle wave only, which, consequently, ought to have enough force to\r\nmake itself felt. Thus this infinite number of waves which originate\r\nat the same instant from all points of a fixed star, big it may be as\r\nthe Sun, make practically only one single wave which may well have\r\nforce enough to produce an impression on our eyes. Moreover from each\r\nluminous point there may come many thousands of waves in the smallest\r\nimaginable time, by the frequent percussion of the corpuscles which\r\nstrike the Ether at these points: which further contributes to\r\nrendering their action more sensible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThere is the further consideration in the emanation of these waves,\r\nthat each particle of matter in which a wave spreads, ought not to\r\ncommunicate its motion only to the next particle which is in the\r\nstraight line drawn from the luminous point, but that it also imparts\r\nsome of it necessarily to all the others which touch it and which\r\noppose themselves to its movement. So it arises that around each\r\nparticle there is made a wave of which that particle is the centre.\r\nThus if DCF is a wave emanating from the luminous point A, which is\r\nits centre, the particle B, one of those comprised within the sphere\r\nDCF, will have made its particular or partial wave KCL, which will\r\ntouch the wave DCF at C at the same moment that the principal wave\r\nemanating from the point A has arrived at DCF; and it is clear that it\r\nwill be only the region C of the wave KCL which will touch the wave\r\nDCF, to wit, that which is in the straight line drawn through AB.\r\nSimilarly the other particles of the sphere DCF, such as _bb_, _dd_,\r\netc., will each make its own wave. But each of these waves can be\r\ninfinitely feeble only as compared with the wave DCF, to the\r\ncomposition of which all the others contribute by the part of their\r\nsurface which is most distant from the centre A.\r\n\r\nOne sees, in addition, that the wave DCF is determined by the\r\ndistance attained in a certain space of time by the movement which\r\nstarted from the point A; there being no movement beyond this wave,\r\nthough there will be in the space which it encloses, namely in parts\r\nof the particular waves, those parts which do not touch the sphere\r\nDCF. And all this ought not to seem fraught with too much minuteness\r\nor subtlety, since we shall see in the sequel that all the properties\r\nof Light, and everything pertaining to its reflexion and its\r\nrefraction, can be explained in principle by this means. This is a\r\nmatter which has been quite unknown to those who hitherto have begun\r\nto consider the waves of light, amongst whom are Mr. Hooke in his\r\n_Micrographia_, and Father Pardies, who, in a treatise of which he let\r\nme see a portion, and which he was unable to complete as he died\r\nshortly afterward, had undertaken to prove by these waves the effects\r\nof reflexion and refraction. But the chief foundation, which consists\r\nin the remark I have just made, was lacking in his demonstrations; and\r\nfor the rest he had opinions very different from mine, as may be will\r\nappear some day if his writing has been preserved.\r\n\r\nTo come to the properties of Light. We remark first that each portion\r\nof a wave ought to spread in such a way that its extremities lie\r\nalways between the same straight lines drawn from the luminous point.\r\nThus the portion BG of the wave, having the luminous point A as its\r\ncentre, will spread into the arc CE bounded by the straight lines ABC,\r\nAGE. For although the particular waves produced by the particles\r\ncomprised within the space CAE spread also outside this space, they\r\nyet do not concur at the same instant to compose a wave which\r\nterminates the movement, as they do precisely at the circumference\r\nCE, which is their common tangent.\r\n\r\nAnd hence one sees the reason why light, at least if its rays are not\r\nreflected or broken, spreads only by straight lines, so that it\r\nilluminates no object except when the path from its source to that\r\nobject is open along such lines.\r\n\r\nFor if, for example, there were an opening BG, limited by opaque\r\nbodies BH, GI, the wave of light which issues from the point A will\r\nalways be terminated by the straight lines AC, AE, as has just been\r\nshown; the parts of the partial waves which spread outside the space\r\nACE being too feeble to produce light there.\r\n\r\nNow, however small we make the opening BG, there is always the same\r\nreason causing the light there to pass between straight lines; since\r\nthis opening is always large enough to contain a great number of\r\nparticles of the ethereal matter, which are of an inconceivable\r\nsmallness; so that it appears that each little portion of the wave\r\nnecessarily advances following the straight line which comes from the\r\nluminous point. Thus then we may take the rays of light as if they\r\nwere straight lines.\r\n\r\nIt appears, moreover, by what has been remarked touching the\r\nfeebleness of the particular waves, that it is not needful that all\r\nthe particles of the Ether should be equal amongst themselves, though\r\nequality is more apt for the propagation of the movement. For it is\r\ntrue that inequality will cause a particle by pushing against another\r\nlarger one to strive to recoil with a part of its movement; but it\r\nwill thereby merely generate backwards towards the luminous point some\r\npartial waves incapable of causing light, and not a wave compounded of\r\nmany as CE was.\r\n\r\nAnother property of waves of light, and one of the most marvellous,\r\nis that when some of them come from different or even from opposing\r\nsides, they produce their effect across one another without any\r\nhindrance. Whence also it comes about that a number of spectators may\r\nview different objects at the same time through the same opening, and\r\nthat two persons can at the same time see one another's eyes. Now\r\naccording to the explanation which has been given of the action of\r\nlight, how the waves do not destroy nor interrupt one another when\r\nthey cross one another, these effects which I have just mentioned are\r\neasily conceived. But in my judgement they are not at all easy to\r\nexplain according to the views of Mr. Des Cartes, who makes Light to\r\nconsist in a continuous pressure merely tending to movement. For this\r\npressure not being able to act from two opposite sides at the same\r\ntime, against bodies which have no inclination to approach one\r\nanother, it is impossible so to understand what I have been saying\r\nabout two persons mutually seeing one another's eyes, or how two\r\ntorches can illuminate one another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nON REFLEXION\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving explained the effects of waves of light which spread in a\r\nhomogeneous matter, we will examine next that which happens to them on\r\nencountering other bodies. We will first make evident how the\r\nReflexion of light is explained by these same waves, and why it\r\npreserves equality of angles.\r\n\r\nLet there be a surface AB; plane and polished, of some metal, glass,\r\nor other body, which at first I will consider as perfectly uniform\r\n(reserving to myself to deal at the end of this demonstration with the\r\ninequalities from which it cannot be exempt), and let a line AC,\r\ninclined to AD, represent a portion of a wave of light, the centre of\r\nwhich is so distant that this portion AC may be considered as a\r\nstraight line; for I consider all this as in one plane, imagining to\r\nmyself that the plane in which this figure is, cuts the sphere of the\r\nwave through its centre and intersects the plane AB at right angles.\r\nThis explanation will suffice once for all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe piece C of the wave AC, will in a certain space of time advance as\r\nfar as the plane AB at B, following the straight line CB, which may be\r\nsupposed to come from the luminous centre, and which in consequence is\r\nperpendicular to AC. Now in this same space of time the portion A of\r\nthe same wave, which has been hindered from communicating its movement\r\nbeyond the plane AB, or at least partly so, ought to have continued\r\nits movement in the matter which is above this plane, and this along a\r\ndistance equal to CB, making its own partial spherical wave,\r\naccording to what has been said above. Which wave is here represented\r\nby the circumference SNR, the centre of which is A, and its\r\nsemi-diameter AN equal to CB.\r\n\r\nIf one considers further the other pieces H of the wave AC, it appears\r\nthat they will not only have reached the surface AB by straight lines\r\nHK parallel to CB, but that in addition they will have generated in\r\nthe transparent air, from the centres K, K, K, particular spherical\r\nwaves, represented here by circumferences the semi-diameters of which\r\nare equal to KM, that is to say to the continuations of HK as far as\r\nthe line BG parallel to AC. But all these circumferences have as a\r\ncommon tangent the straight line BN, namely the same which is drawn\r\nfrom B as a tangent to the first of the circles, of which A is the\r\ncentre, and AN the semi-diameter equal to BC, as is easy to see.\r\n\r\nIt is then the line BN (comprised between B and the point N where the\r\nperpendicular from the point A falls) which is as it were formed by\r\nall these circumferences, and which terminates the movement which is\r\nmade by the reflexion of the wave AC; and it is also the place where\r\nthe movement occurs in much greater quantity than anywhere else.\r\nWherefore, according to that which has been explained, BN is the\r\npropagation of the wave AC at the moment when the piece C of it has\r\narrived at B. For there is no other line which like BN is a common\r\ntangent to all the aforesaid circles, except BG below the plane AB;\r\nwhich line BG would be the propagation of the wave if the movement\r\ncould have spread in a medium homogeneous with that which is above the\r\nplane. And if one wishes to see how the wave AC has come successively\r\nto BN, one has only to draw in the same figure the straight lines KO\r\nparallel to BN, and the straight lines KL parallel to AC. Thus one\r\nwill see that the straight wave AC has become broken up into all the\r\nOKL parts successively, and that it has become straight again at NB.\r\n\r\nNow it is apparent here that the angle of reflexion is made equal to\r\nthe angle of incidence. For the triangles ACB, BNA being rectangular\r\nand having the side AB common, and the side CB equal to NA, it follows\r\nthat the angles opposite to these sides will be equal, and therefore\r\nalso the angles CBA, NAB. But as CB, perpendicular to CA, marks the\r\ndirection of the incident ray, so AN, perpendicular to the wave BN,\r\nmarks the direction of the reflected ray; hence these rays are equally\r\ninclined to the plane AB.\r\n\r\nBut in considering the preceding demonstration, one might aver that it\r\nis indeed true that BN is the common tangent of the circular waves in\r\nthe plane of this figure, but that these waves, being in truth\r\nspherical, have still an infinitude of similar tangents, namely all\r\nthe straight lines which are drawn from the point B in the surface\r\ngenerated by the straight line BN about the axis BA. It remains,\r\ntherefore, to demonstrate that there is no difficulty herein: and by\r\nthe same argument one will see why the incident ray and the reflected\r\nray are always in one and the same plane perpendicular to the\r\nreflecting plane. I say then that the wave AC, being regarded only as\r\na line, produces no light. For a visible ray of light, however narrow\r\nit may be, has always some width, and consequently it is necessary, in\r\nrepresenting the wave whose progression constitutes the ray, to put\r\ninstead of a line AC some plane figure such as the circle HC in the\r\nfollowing figure, by supposing, as we have done, the luminous point to\r\nbe infinitely distant. Now it is easy to see, following the preceding\r\ndemonstration, that each small piece of this wave HC having arrived at\r\nthe plane AB, and there generating each one its particular wave, these\r\nwill all have, when C arrives at B, a common plane which will touch\r\nthem, namely a circle BN similar to CH; and this will be intersected\r\nat its middle and at right angles by the same plane which likewise\r\nintersects the circle CH and the ellipse AB.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne sees also that the said spheres of the partial waves cannot have\r\nany common tangent plane other than the circle BN; so that it will be\r\nthis plane where there will be more reflected movement than anywhere\r\nelse, and which will therefore carry on the light in continuance from\r\nthe wave CH.\r\n\r\nI have also stated in the preceding demonstration that the movement of\r\nthe piece A of the incident wave is not able to communicate itself\r\nbeyond the plane AB, or at least not wholly. Whence it is to be\r\nremarked that though the movement of the ethereal matter might\r\ncommunicate itself partly to that of the reflecting body, this could\r\nin nothing alter the velocity of progression of the waves, on which\r\nthe angle of reflexion depends. For a slight percussion ought to\r\ngenerate waves as rapid as strong percussion in the same matter. This\r\ncomes about from the property of bodies which act as springs, of which\r\nwe have spoken above; namely that whether compressed little or much\r\nthey recoil in equal times. Equally so in every reflexion of the\r\nlight, against whatever body it may be, the angles of reflexion and\r\nincidence ought to be equal notwithstanding that the body might be of\r\nsuch a nature that it takes away a portion of the movement made by the\r\nincident light. And experiment shows that in fact there is no polished\r\nbody the reflexion of which does not follow this rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the thing to be above all remarked in our demonstration is that it\r\ndoes not require that the reflecting surface should be considered as a\r\nuniform plane, as has been supposed by all those who have tried to\r\nexplain the effects of reflexion; but only an evenness such as may be\r\nattained by the particles of the matter of the reflecting body being\r\nset near to one another; which particles are larger than those of the\r\nethereal matter, as will appear by what we shall say in treating of\r\nthe transparency and opacity of bodies. For the surface consisting\r\nthus of particles put together, and the ethereal particles being\r\nabove, and smaller, it is evident that one could not demonstrate the\r\nequality of the angles of incidence and reflexion by similitude to\r\nthat which happens to a ball thrown against a wall, of which writers\r\nhave always made use. In our way, on the other hand, the thing is\r\nexplained without difficulty. For the smallness of the particles of\r\nquicksilver, for example, being such that one must conceive millions\r\nof them, in the smallest visible surface proposed, arranged like a\r\nheap of grains of sand which has been flattened as much as it is\r\ncapable of being, this surface then becomes for our purpose as even\r\nas a polished glass is: and, although it always remains rough with\r\nrespect to the particles of the Ether it is evident that the centres\r\nof all the particular spheres of reflexion, of which we have spoken,\r\nare almost in one uniform plane, and that thus the common tangent can\r\nfit to them as perfectly as is requisite for the production of light.\r\nAnd this alone is requisite, in our method of demonstration, to cause\r\nequality of the said angles without the remainder of the movement\r\nreflected from all parts being able to produce any contrary effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nON REFRACTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same way as the effects of Reflexion have been explained by\r\nwaves of light reflected at the surface of polished bodies, we will\r\nexplain transparency and the phenomena of refraction by waves which\r\nspread within and across diaphanous bodies, both solids, such as\r\nglass, and liquids, such as water, oils, etc. But in order that it may\r\nnot seem strange to suppose this passage of waves in the interior of\r\nthese bodies, I will first show that one may conceive it possible in\r\nmore than one mode.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, if the ethereal matter cannot penetrate transparent\r\nbodies at all, their own particles would be able to communicate\r\nsuccessively the movement of the waves, the same as do those of the\r\nEther, supposing that, like those, they are of a nature to act as a\r\nspring. And this is easy to conceive as regards water and other\r\ntransparent liquids, they being composed of detached particles. But it\r\nmay seem more difficult as regards glass and other transparent and\r\nhard bodies, because their solidity does not seem to permit them to\r\nreceive movement except in their whole mass at the same time. This,\r\nhowever, is not necessary because this solidity is not such as it\r\nappears to us, it being probable rather that these bodies are composed\r\nof particles merely placed close to one another and held together by\r\nsome pressure from without of some other matter, and by the\r\nirregularity of their shapes. For primarily their rarity is shown by\r\nthe facility with which there passes through them the matter of the\r\nvortices of the magnet, and that which causes gravity. Further, one\r\ncannot say that these bodies are of a texture similar to that of a\r\nsponge or of light bread, because the heat of the fire makes them flow\r\nand thereby changes the situation of the particles amongst themselves.\r\nIt remains then that they are, as has been said, assemblages of\r\nparticles which touch one another without constituting a continuous\r\nsolid. This being so, the movement which these particles receive to\r\ncarry on the waves of light, being merely communicated from some of\r\nthem to others, without their going for that purpose out of their\r\nplaces or without derangement, it may very well produce its effect\r\nwithout prejudicing in any way the apparent solidity of the compound.\r\n\r\nBy pressure from without, of which I have spoken, must not be\r\nunderstood that of the air, which would not be sufficient, but that of\r\nsome other more subtle matter, a pressure which I chanced upon by\r\nexperiment long ago, namely in the case of water freed from air, which\r\nremains suspended in a tube open at its lower end, notwithstanding\r\nthat the air has been removed from the vessel in which this tube is\r\nenclosed.\r\n\r\nOne can then in this way conceive of transparency in a solid without\r\nany necessity that the ethereal matter which serves for light should\r\npass through it, or that it should find pores in which to insinuate\r\nitself. But the truth is that this matter not only passes through\r\nsolids, but does so even with great facility; of which the experiment\r\nof Torricelli, above cited, is already a proof. Because on the\r\nquicksilver and the water quitting the upper part of the glass tube,\r\nit appears that it is immediately filled with ethereal matter, since\r\nlight passes across it. But here is another argument which proves this\r\nready penetrability, not only in transparent bodies but also in all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWhen light passes across a hollow sphere of glass, closed on all\r\nsides, it is certain that it is full of ethereal matter, as much as\r\nthe spaces outside the sphere. And this ethereal matter, as has been\r\nshown above, consists of particles which just touch one another. If\r\nthen it were enclosed in the sphere in such a way that it could not\r\nget out through the pores of the glass, it would be obliged to follow\r\nthe movement of the sphere when one changes its place: and it would\r\nrequire consequently almost the same force to impress a certain\r\nvelocity on this sphere, when placed on a horizontal plane, as if it\r\nwere full of water or perhaps of quicksilver: because every body\r\nresists the velocity of the motion which one would give to it, in\r\nproportion to the quantity of matter which it contains, and which is\r\nobliged to follow this motion. But on the contrary one finds that the\r\nsphere resists the impress of movement only in proportion to the\r\nquantity of matter of the glass of which it is made. Then it must be\r\nthat the ethereal matter which is inside is not shut up, but flows\r\nthrough it with very great freedom. We shall demonstrate hereafter\r\nthat by this process the same penetrability may be inferred also as\r\nrelating to opaque bodies.\r\n\r\nThe second mode then of explaining transparency, and one which appears\r\nmore probably true, is by saying that the waves of light are carried\r\non in the ethereal matter, which continuously occupies the interstices\r\nor pores of transparent bodies. For since it passes through them\r\ncontinuously and freely, it follows that they are always full of it.\r\nAnd one may even show that these interstices occupy much more space\r\nthan the coherent particles which constitute the bodies. For if what\r\nwe have just said is true: that force is required to impress a certain\r\nhorizontal velocity on bodies in proportion as they contain coherent\r\nmatter; and if the proportion of this force follows the law of\r\nweights, as is confirmed by experiment, then the quantity of the\r\nconstituent matter of bodies also follows the proportion of their\r\nweights. Now we see that water weighs only one fourteenth part as much\r\nas an equal portion of quicksilver: therefore the matter of the water\r\ndoes not occupy the fourteenth part of the space which its mass\r\nobtains. It must even occupy much less of it, since quicksilver is\r\nless heavy than gold, and the matter of gold is by no means dense, as\r\nfollows from the fact that the matter of the vortices of the magnet\r\nand of that which is the cause of gravity pass very freely through it.\r\n\r\nBut it may be objected here that if water is a body of so great\r\nrarity, and if its particles occupy so small a portion of the space of\r\nits apparent bulk, it is very strange how it yet resists Compression\r\nso strongly without permitting itself to be condensed by any force\r\nwhich one has hitherto essayed to employ, preserving even its entire\r\nliquidity while subjected to this pressure.\r\n\r\nThis is no small difficulty. It may, however, be resolved by saying\r\nthat the very violent and rapid motion of the subtle matter which\r\nrenders water liquid, by agitating the particles of which it is\r\ncomposed, maintains this liquidity in spite of the pressure which\r\nhitherto any one has been minded to apply to it.\r\n\r\nThe rarity of transparent bodies being then such as we have said, one\r\neasily conceives that the waves might be carried on in the ethereal\r\nmatter which fills the interstices of the particles. And, moreover,\r\none may believe that the progression of these waves ought to be a\r\nlittle slower in the interior of bodies, by reason of the small\r\ndetours which the same particles cause. In which different velocity of\r\nlight I shall show the cause of refraction to consist.\r\n\r\nBefore doing so, I will indicate the third and last mode in which\r\ntransparency may be conceived; which is by supposing that the movement\r\nof the waves of light is transmitted indifferently both in the\r\nparticles of the ethereal matter which occupy the interstices of\r\nbodies, and in the particles which compose them, so that the movement\r\npasses from one to the other. And it will be seen hereafter that this\r\nhypothesis serves excellently to explain the double refraction of\r\ncertain transparent bodies.\r\n\r\nShould it be objected that if the particles of the ether are smaller\r\nthan those of transparent bodies (since they pass through their\r\nintervals), it would follow that they can communicate to them but\r\nlittle of their movement, it may be replied that the particles of\r\nthese bodies are in turn composed of still smaller particles, and so\r\nit will be these secondary particles which will receive the movement\r\nfrom those of the ether.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if the particles of transparent bodies have a recoil a\r\nlittle less prompt than that of the ethereal particles, which nothing\r\nhinders us from supposing, it will again follow that the progression\r\nof the waves of light will be slower in the interior of such bodies\r\nthan it is outside in the ethereal matter.\r\n\r\nAll this I have found as most probable for the mode in which the waves\r\nof light pass across transparent bodies. To which it must further be\r\nadded in what respect these bodies differ from those which are opaque;\r\nand the more so since it might seem because of the easy penetration of\r\nbodies by the ethereal matter, of which mention has been made, that\r\nthere would not be any body that was not transparent. For by the same\r\nreasoning about the hollow sphere which I have employed to prove the\r\nsmallness of the density of glass and its easy penetrability by the\r\nethereal matter, one might also prove that the same penetrability\r\nobtains for metals and for every other sort of body. For this sphere\r\nbeing for example of silver, it is certain that it contains some of\r\nthe ethereal matter which serves for light, since this was there as\r\nwell as in the air when the opening of the sphere was closed. Yet,\r\nbeing closed and placed upon a horizontal plane, it resists the\r\nmovement which one wishes to give to it, merely according to the\r\nquantity of silver of which it is made; so that one must conclude, as\r\nabove, that the ethereal matter which is enclosed does not follow the\r\nmovement of the sphere; and that therefore silver, as well as glass,\r\nis very easily penetrated by this matter. Some of it is therefore\r\npresent continuously and in quantities between the particles of silver\r\nand of all other opaque bodies: and since it serves for the\r\npropagation of light it would seem that these bodies ought also to be\r\ntransparent, which however is not the case.\r\n\r\nWhence then, one will say, does their opacity come? Is it because the\r\nparticles which compose them are soft; that is to say, these particles\r\nbeing composed of others that are smaller, are they capable of\r\nchanging their figure on receiving the pressure of the ethereal\r\nparticles, the motion of which they thereby damp, and so hinder the\r\ncontinuance of the waves of light? That cannot be: for if the\r\nparticles of the metals are soft, how is it that polished silver and\r\nmercury reflect light so strongly? What I find to be most probable\r\nherein, is to say that metallic bodies, which are almost the only\r\nreally opaque ones, have mixed amongst their hard particles some soft\r\nones; so that some serve to cause reflexion and the others to hinder\r\ntransparency; while, on the other hand, transparent bodies contain\r\nonly hard particles which have the faculty of recoil, and serve\r\ntogether with those of the ethereal matter for the propagation of the\r\nwaves of light, as has been said.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet us pass now to the explanation of the effects of Refraction,\r\nassuming, as we have done, the passage of waves of light through\r\ntransparent bodies, and the diminution of velocity which these same\r\nwaves suffer in them.\r\n\r\nThe chief property of Refraction is that a ray of light, such as AB,\r\nbeing in the air, and falling obliquely upon the polished surface of a\r\ntransparent body, such as FG, is broken at the point of incidence B,\r\nin such a way that with the straight line DBE which cuts the surface\r\nperpendicularly it makes an angle CBE less than ABD which it made with\r\nthe same perpendicular when in the air. And the measure of these\r\nangles is found by describing, about the point B, a circle which cuts\r\nthe radii AB, BC. For the perpendiculars AD, CE, let fall from the\r\npoints of intersection upon the straight line DE, which are called the\r\nSines of the angles ABD, CBE, have a certain ratio between themselves;\r\nwhich ratio is always the same for all inclinations of the incident\r\nray, at least for a given transparent body. This ratio is, in glass,\r\nvery nearly as 3 to 2; and in water very nearly as 4 to 3; and is\r\nlikewise different in other diaphanous bodies.\r\n\r\nAnother property, similar to this, is that the refractions are\r\nreciprocal between the rays entering into a transparent body and those\r\nwhich are leaving it. That is to say that if the ray AB in entering\r\nthe transparent body is refracted into BC, then likewise CB being\r\ntaken as a ray in the interior of this body will be refracted, on\r\npassing out, into BA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo explain then the reasons of these phenomena according to our\r\nprinciples, let AB be the straight line which represents a plane\r\nsurface bounding the transparent substances which lie towards C and\r\ntowards N. When I say plane, that does not signify a perfect evenness,\r\nbut such as has been understood in treating of reflexion, and for the\r\nsame reason. Let the line AC represent a portion of a wave of light,\r\nthe centre of which is supposed so distant that this portion may be\r\nconsidered as a straight line. The piece C, then, of the wave AC, will\r\nin a certain space of time have advanced as far as the plane AB\r\nfollowing the straight line CB, which may be imagined as coming from\r\nthe luminous centre, and which consequently will cut AC at right\r\nangles. Now in the same time the piece A would have come to G along\r\nthe straight line AG, equal and parallel to CB; and all the portion of\r\nwave AC would be at GB if the matter of the transparent body\r\ntransmitted the movement of the wave as quickly as the matter of the\r\nEther. But let us suppose that it transmits this movement less\r\nquickly, by one-third, for instance. Movement will then be spread from\r\nthe point A, in the matter of the transparent body through a distance\r\nequal to two-thirds of CB, making its own particular spherical wave\r\naccording to what has been said before. This wave is then represented\r\nby the circumference SNR, the centre of which is A, and its\r\nsemi-diameter equal to two-thirds of CB. Then if one considers in\r\norder the other pieces H of the wave AC, it appears that in the same\r\ntime that the piece C reaches B they will not only have arrived at the\r\nsurface AB along the straight lines HK parallel to CB, but that, in\r\naddition, they will have generated in the diaphanous substance from\r\nthe centres K, partial waves, represented here by circumferences the\r\nsemi-diameters of which are equal to two-thirds of the lines KM, that\r\nis to say, to two-thirds of the prolongations of HK down to the\r\nstraight line BG; for these semi-diameters would have been equal to\r\nentire lengths of KM if the two transparent substances had been of the\r\nsame penetrability.\r\n\r\nNow all these circumferences have for a common tangent the straight\r\nline BN; namely the same line which is drawn as a tangent from the\r\npoint B to the circumference SNR which we considered first. For it is\r\neasy to see that all the other circumferences will touch the same BN,\r\nfrom B up to the point of contact N, which is the same point where AN\r\nfalls perpendicularly on BN.\r\n\r\nIt is then BN, which is formed by small arcs of these circumferences,\r\nwhich terminates the movement that the wave AC has communicated within\r\nthe transparent body, and where this movement occurs in much greater\r\namount than anywhere else. And for that reason this line, in\r\naccordance with what has been said more than once, is the propagation\r\nof the wave AC at the moment when its piece C has reached B. For there\r\nis no other line below the plane AB which is, like BN, a common\r\ntangent to all these partial waves. And if one would know how the wave\r\nAC has come progressively to BN, it is necessary only to draw in the\r\nsame figure the straight lines KO parallel to BN, and all the lines KL\r\nparallel to AC. Thus one will see that the wave CA, from being a\r\nstraight line, has become broken in all the positions LKO\r\nsuccessively, and that it has again become a straight line at BN. This\r\nbeing evident by what has already been demonstrated, there is no need\r\nto explain it further.\r\n\r\nNow, in the same figure, if one draws EAF, which cuts the plane AB at\r\nright angles at the point A, since AD is perpendicular to the wave AC,\r\nit will be DA which will mark the ray of incident light, and AN which\r\nwas perpendicular to BN, the refracted ray: since the rays are nothing\r\nelse than the straight lines along which the portions of the waves\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nWhence it is easy to recognize this chief property of refraction,\r\nnamely that the Sine of the angle DAE has always the same ratio to the\r\nSine of the angle NAF, whatever be the inclination of the ray DA: and\r\nthat this ratio is the same as that of the velocity of the waves in\r\nthe transparent substance which is towards AE to their velocity in the\r\ntransparent substance towards AF. For, considering AB as the radius of\r\na circle, the Sine of the angle BAC is BC, and the Sine of the angle\r\nABN is AN. But the angle BAC is equal to DAE, since each of them added\r\nto CAE makes a right angle. And the angle ABN is equal to NAF, since\r\neach of them with BAN makes a right angle. Then also the Sine of the\r\nangle DAE is to the Sine of NAF as BC is to AN. But the ratio of BC to\r\nAN was the same as that of the velocities of light in the substance\r\nwhich is towards AE and in that which is towards AF; therefore also\r\nthe Sine of the angle DAE will be to the Sine of the angle NAF the\r\nsame as the said velocities of light.\r\n\r\nTo see, consequently, what the refraction will be when the waves of\r\nlight pass into a substance in which the movement travels more quickly\r\nthan in that from which they emerge (let us again assume the ratio of\r\n3 to 2), it is only necessary to repeat all the same construction and\r\ndemonstration which we have just used, merely substituting everywhere\r\n3/2 instead of 2/3. And it will be found by the same reasoning, in\r\nthis other figure, that when the piece C of the wave AC shall have\r\nreached the surface AB at B, all the portions of the wave AC will\r\nhave advanced as far as BN, so that BC the perpendicular on AC is to\r\nAN the perpendicular on BN as 2 to 3. And there will finally be this\r\nsame ratio of 2 to 3 between the Sine of the angle BAD and the Sine of\r\nthe angle FAN.\r\n\r\nHence one sees the reciprocal relation of the refractions of the ray\r\non entering and on leaving one and the same transparent body: namely\r\nthat if NA falling on the external surface AB is refracted into the\r\ndirection AD, so the ray AD will be refracted on leaving the\r\ntransparent body into the direction AN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne sees also the reason for a noteworthy accident which happens in\r\nthis refraction: which is this, that after a certain obliquity of the\r\nincident ray DA, it begins to be quite unable to penetrate into the\r\nother transparent substance. For if the angle DAQ or CBA is such that\r\nin the triangle ACB, CB is equal to 2/3 of AB, or is greater, then AN\r\ncannot form one side of the triangle ANB, since it becomes equal to or\r\ngreater than AB: so that the portion of wave BN cannot be found\r\nanywhere, neither consequently can AN, which ought to be perpendicular\r\nto it. And thus the incident ray DA does not then pierce the surface\r\nAB.\r\n\r\nWhen the ratio of the velocities of the waves is as two to three, as\r\nin our example, which is that which obtains for glass and air, the\r\nangle DAQ must be more than 48 degrees 11 minutes in order that the\r\nray DA may be able to pass by refraction. And when the ratio of the\r\nvelocities is as 3 to 4, as it is very nearly in water and air, this\r\nangle DAQ must exceed 41 degrees 24 minutes. And this accords\r\nperfectly with experiment.\r\n\r\nBut it might here be asked: since the meeting of the wave AC against\r\nthe surface AB ought to produce movement in the matter which is on the\r\nother side, why does no light pass there? To which the reply is easy\r\nif one remembers what has been said before. For although it generates\r\nan infinitude of partial waves in the matter which is at the other\r\nside of AB, these waves never have a common tangent line (either\r\nstraight or curved) at the same moment; and so there is no line\r\nterminating the propagation of the wave AC beyond the plane AB, nor\r\nany place where the movement is gathered together in sufficiently\r\ngreat quantity to produce light. And one will easily see the truth of\r\nthis, namely that CB being larger than 2/3 of AB, the waves excited\r\nbeyond the plane AB will have no common tangent if about the centres K\r\none then draws circles having radii equal to 3/2 of the lengths LB to\r\nwhich they correspond. For all these circles will be enclosed in one\r\nanother and will all pass beyond the point B.\r\n\r\nNow it is to be remarked that from the moment when the angle DAQ is\r\nsmaller than is requisite to permit the refracted ray DA to pass into\r\nthe other transparent substance, one finds that the interior reflexion\r\nwhich occurs at the surface AB is much augmented in brightness, as is\r\neasy to realize by experiment with a triangular prism; and for this\r\nour theory can afford this reason. When the angle DAQ is still large\r\nenough to enable the ray DA to pass, it is evident that the light from\r\nthe portion AC of the wave is collected in a minimum space when it\r\nreaches BN. It appears also that the wave BN becomes so much the\r\nsmaller as the angle CBA or DAQ is made less; until when the latter is\r\ndiminished to the limit indicated a little previously, this wave BN is\r\ncollected together always at one point. That is to say, that when the\r\npiece C of the wave AC has then arrived at B, the wave BN which is the\r\npropagation of AC is entirely reduced to the same point B. Similarly\r\nwhen the piece H has reached K, the part AH is entirely reduced to the\r\nsame point K. This makes it evident that in proportion as the wave CA\r\ncomes to meet the surface AB, there occurs a great quantity of\r\nmovement along that surface; which movement ought also to spread\r\nwithin the transparent body and ought to have much re-enforced the\r\npartial waves which produce the interior reflexion against the surface\r\nAB, according to the laws of reflexion previously explained.\r\n\r\nAnd because a slight diminution of the angle of incidence DAQ causes\r\nthe wave BN, however great it was, to be reduced to zero, (for this\r\nangle being 49 degrees 11 minutes in the glass, the angle BAN is still\r\n11 degrees 21 minutes, and the same angle being reduced by one degree\r\nonly the angle BAN is reduced to zero, and so the wave BN reduced to a\r\npoint) thence it comes about that the interior reflexion from being\r\nobscure becomes suddenly bright, so soon as the angle of incidence is\r\nsuch that it no longer gives passage to the refraction.\r\n\r\nNow as concerns ordinary external reflexion, that is to say which\r\noccurs when the angle of incidence DAQ is still large enough to enable\r\nthe refracted ray to penetrate beyond the surface AB, this reflexion\r\nshould occur against the particles of the substance which touches the\r\ntransparent body on its outside. And it apparently occurs against the\r\nparticles of the air or others mingled with the ethereal particles and\r\nlarger than they. So on the other hand the external reflexion of these\r\nbodies occurs against the particles which compose them, and which are\r\nalso larger than those of the ethereal matter, since the latter flows\r\nin their interstices. It is true that there remains here some\r\ndifficulty in those experiments in which this interior reflexion\r\noccurs without the particles of air being able to contribute to it, as\r\nin vessels or tubes from which the air has been extracted.\r\n\r\nExperience, moreover, teaches us that these two reflexions are of\r\nnearly equal force, and that in different transparent bodies they are\r\nso much the stronger as the refraction of these bodies is the greater.\r\nThus one sees manifestly that the reflexion of glass is stronger than\r\nthat of water, and that of diamond stronger than that of glass.\r\n\r\nI will finish this theory of refraction by demonstrating a remarkable\r\nproposition which depends on it; namely, that a ray of light in order\r\nto go from one point to another, when these points are in different\r\nmedia, is refracted in such wise at the plane surface which joins\r\nthese two media that it employs the least possible time: and exactly\r\nthe same happens in the case of reflexion against a plane surface. Mr.\r\nFermat was the first to propound this property of refraction, holding\r\nwith us, and directly counter to the opinion of Mr. Des Cartes, that\r\nlight passes more slowly through glass and water than through air.\r\nBut he assumed besides this a constant ratio of Sines, which we have\r\njust proved by these different degrees of velocity alone: or rather,\r\nwhat is equivalent, he assumed not only that the velocities were\r\ndifferent but that the light took the least time possible for its\r\npassage, and thence deduced the constant ratio of the Sines. His\r\ndemonstration, which may be seen in his printed works, and in the\r\nvolume of letters of Mr. Des Cartes, is very long; wherefore I give\r\nhere another which is simpler and easier.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet KF be the plane surface; A the point in the medium which the light\r\ntraverses more easily, as the air; C the point in the other which is\r\nmore difficult to penetrate, as water. And suppose that a ray has come\r\nfrom A, by B, to C, having been refracted at B according to the law\r\ndemonstrated a little before; that is to say that, having drawn PBQ,\r\nwhich cuts the plane at right angles, let the sine of the angle ABP\r\nhave to the sine of the angle CBQ the same ratio as the velocity of\r\nlight in the medium where A is to the velocity of light in the medium\r\nwhere C is. It is to be shown that the time of passage of light along\r\nAB and BC taken together, is the shortest that can be. Let us assume\r\nthat it may have come by other lines, and, in the first place, along\r\nAF, FC, so that the point of refraction F may be further from B than\r\nthe point A; and let AO be a line perpendicular to AB, and FO parallel\r\nto AB; BH perpendicular to FO, and FG to BC.\r\n\r\nSince then the angle HBF is equal to PBA, and the angle BFG equal to\r\nQBC, it follows that the sine of the angle HBF will also have the same\r\nratio to the sine of BFG, as the velocity of light in the medium A is\r\nto its velocity in the medium C. But these sines are the straight\r\nlines HF, BG, if we take BF as the semi-diameter of a circle. Then\r\nthese lines HF, BG, will bear to one another the said ratio of the\r\nvelocities. And, therefore, the time of the light along HF, supposing\r\nthat the ray had been OF, would be equal to the time along BG in the\r\ninterior of the medium C. But the time along AB is equal to the time\r\nalong OH; therefore the time along OF is equal to the time along AB,\r\nBG. Again the time along FC is greater than that along GC; then the\r\ntime along OFC will be longer than that along ABC. But AF is longer\r\nthan OF, then the time along AFC will by just so much more exceed the\r\ntime along ABC.\r\n\r\nNow let us assume that the ray has come from A to C along AK, KC; the\r\npoint of refraction K being nearer to A than the point B is; and let\r\nCN be the perpendicular upon BC, KN parallel to BC: BM perpendicular\r\nupon KN, and KL upon BA.\r\n\r\nHere BL and KM are the sines of angles BKL, KBM; that is to say, of\r\nthe angles PBA, QBC; and therefore they are to one another as the\r\nvelocity of light in the medium A is to the velocity in the medium C.\r\nThen the time along LB is equal to the time along KM; and since the\r\ntime along BC is equal to the time along MN, the time along LBC will\r\nbe equal to the time along KMN. But the time along AK is longer than\r\nthat along AL: hence the time along AKN is longer than that along ABC.\r\nAnd KC being longer than KN, the time along AKC will exceed, by as\r\nmuch more, the time along ABC. Hence it appears that the time along\r\nABC is the shortest possible; which was to be proven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nON THE REFRACTION OF THE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have shown how the movement which constitutes light spreads by\r\nspherical waves in any homogeneous matter. And it is evident that when\r\nthe matter is not homogeneous, but of such a constitution that the\r\nmovement is communicated in it more rapidly toward one side than\r\ntoward another, these waves cannot be spherical: but that they must\r\nacquire their figure according to the different distances over which\r\nthe successive movement passes in equal times.\r\n\r\nIt is thus that we shall in the first place explain the refractions\r\nwhich occur in the air, which extends from here to the clouds and\r\nbeyond. The effects of which refractions are very remarkable; for by\r\nthem we often see objects which the rotundity of the Earth ought\r\notherwise to hide; such as Islands, and the tops of mountains when one\r\nis at sea. Because also of them the Sun and the Moon appear as risen\r\nbefore in fact they have, and appear to set later: so that at times\r\nthe Moon has been seen eclipsed while the Sun appeared still above the\r\nhorizon. And so also the heights of the Sun and of the Moon, and those\r\nof all the Stars always appear a little greater than they are in\r\nreality, because of these same refractions, as Astronomers know. But\r\nthere is one experiment which renders this refraction very evident;\r\nwhich is that of fixing a telescope on some spot so that it views an\r\nobject, such as a steeple or a house, at a distance of half a league\r\nor more. If then you look through it at different hours of the day,\r\nleaving it always fixed in the same way, you will see that the same\r\nspots of the object will not always appear at the middle of the\r\naperture of the telescope, but that generally in the morning and in\r\nthe evening, when there are more vapours near the Earth, these objects\r\nseem to rise higher, so that the half or more of them will no longer\r\nbe visible; and so that they seem lower toward mid-day when these\r\nvapours are dissipated.\r\n\r\nThose who consider refraction to occur only in the surfaces which\r\nseparate transparent bodies of different nature, would find it\r\ndifficult to give a reason for all that I have just related; but\r\naccording to our Theory the thing is quite easy. It is known that the\r\nair which surrounds us, besides the particles which are proper to it\r\nand which float in the ethereal matter as has been explained, is full\r\nalso of particles of water which are raised by the action of heat; and\r\nit has been ascertained further by some very definite experiments that\r\nas one mounts up higher the density of air diminishes in proportion.\r\nNow whether the particles of water and those of air take part, by\r\nmeans of the particles of ethereal matter, in the movement which\r\nconstitutes light, but have a less prompt recoil than these, or\r\nwhether the encounter and hindrance which these particles of air and\r\nwater offer to the propagation of movement of the ethereal progress,\r\nretard the progression, it follows that both kinds of particles flying\r\namidst the ethereal particles, must render the air, from a great\r\nheight down to the Earth, gradually less easy for the spreading of the\r\nwaves of light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhence the configuration of the waves ought to become nearly such as\r\nthis figure represents: namely, if A is a light, or the visible point\r\nof a steeple, the waves which start from it ought to spread more\r\nwidely upwards and less widely downwards, but in other directions more\r\nor less as they approximate to these two extremes. This being so, it\r\nnecessarily follows that every line intersecting one of these waves at\r\nright angles will pass above the point A, always excepting the one\r\nline which is perpendicular to the horizon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet BC be the wave which brings the light to the spectator who is at\r\nB, and let BD be the straight line which intersects this wave at right\r\nangles. Now because the ray or straight line by which we judge the\r\nspot where the object appears to us is nothing else than the\r\nperpendicular to the wave that reaches our eye, as will be understood\r\nby what was said above, it is manifest that the point A will be\r\nperceived as being in the line BD, and therefore higher than in fact it\r\nis.\r\n\r\nSimilarly if the Earth be AB, and the top of the Atmosphere CD, which\r\nprobably is not a well defined spherical surface (since we know that\r\nthe air becomes rare in proportion as one ascends, for above there is\r\nso much less of it to press down upon it), the waves of light from the\r\nsun coming, for instance, in such a way that so long as they have not\r\nreached the Atmosphere CD the straight line AE intersects them\r\nperpendicularly, they ought, when they enter the Atmosphere, to\r\nadvance more quickly in elevated regions than in regions nearer to the\r\nEarth. So that if CA is the wave which brings the light to the\r\nspectator at A, its region C will be the furthest advanced; and the\r\nstraight line AF, which intersects this wave at right angles, and\r\nwhich determines the apparent place of the Sun, will pass above the\r\nreal Sun, which will be seen along the line AE. And so it may occur\r\nthat when it ought not to be visible in the absence of vapours,\r\nbecause the line AE encounters the rotundity of the Earth, it will be\r\nperceived in the line AF by refraction. But this angle EAF is scarcely\r\never more than half a degree because the attenuation of the vapours\r\nalters the waves of light but little. Furthermore these refractions\r\nare not altogether constant in all weathers, particularly at small\r\nelevations of 2 or 3 degrees; which results from the different\r\nquantity of aqueous vapours rising above the Earth.\r\n\r\nAnd this same thing is the cause why at certain times a distant object\r\nwill be hidden behind another less distant one, and yet may at another\r\ntime be able to be seen, although the spot from which it is viewed is\r\nalways the same. But the reason for this effect will be still more\r\nevident from what we are going to remark touching the curvature of\r\nrays. It appears from the things explained above that the progression\r\nor propagation of a small part of a wave of light is properly what one\r\ncalls a ray. Now these rays, instead of being straight as they are in\r\nhomogeneous media, ought to be curved in an atmosphere of unequal\r\npenetrability. For they necessarily follow from the object to the eye\r\nthe line which intersects at right angles all the progressions of the\r\nwaves, as in the first figure the line AEB does, as will be shown\r\nhereafter; and it is this line which determines what interposed bodies\r\nwould or would not hinder us from seeing the object. For although the\r\npoint of the steeple A appears raised to D, it would yet not appear to\r\nthe eye B if the tower H was between the two, because it crosses the\r\ncurve AEB. But the tower E, which is beneath this curve, does not\r\nhinder the point A from being seen. Now according as the air near the\r\nEarth exceeds in density that which is higher, the curvature of the\r\nray AEB becomes greater: so that at certain times it passes above the\r\nsummit E, which allows the point A to be perceived by the eye at B;\r\nand at other times it is intercepted by the same tower E which hides A\r\nfrom this same eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut to demonstrate this curvature of the rays conformably to all our\r\npreceding Theory, let us imagine that AB is a small portion of a wave\r\nof light coming from the side C, which we may consider as a straight\r\nline. Let us also suppose that it is perpendicular to the Horizon, the\r\nportion B being nearer to the Earth than the portion A; and that\r\nbecause the vapours are less hindering at A than at B, the particular\r\nwave which comes from the point A spreads through a certain space AD\r\nwhile the particular wave which starts from the point B spreads\r\nthrough a shorter space BE; AD and BE being parallel to the Horizon.\r\nFurther, supposing the straight lines FG, HI, etc., to be drawn from\r\nan infinitude of points in the straight line AB and to terminate on\r\nthe line DE (which is straight or may be considered as such), let the\r\ndifferent penetrabilities at the different heights in the air between\r\nA and B be represented by all these lines; so that the particular\r\nwave, originating from the point F, will spread across the space FG,\r\nand that from the point H across the space HI, while that from the\r\npoint A spreads across the space AD.\r\n\r\nNow if about the centres A, B, one describes the circles DK, EL, which\r\nrepresent the spreading of the waves which originate from these two\r\npoints, and if one draws the straight line KL which touches these two\r\ncircles, it is easy to see that this same line will be the common\r\ntangent to all the other circles drawn about the centres F, H, etc.;\r\nand that all the points of contact will fall within that part of this\r\nline which is comprised between the perpendiculars AK, BL. Then it\r\nwill be the line KL which will terminate the movement of the\r\nparticular waves originating from the points of the wave AB; and this\r\nmovement will be stronger between the points KL, than anywhere else at\r\nthe same instant, since an infinitude of circumferences concur to form\r\nthis straight line; and consequently KL will be the propagation of the\r\nportion of wave AB, as has been said in explaining reflexion and\r\nordinary refraction. Now it appears that AK and BL dip down toward the\r\nside where the air is less easy to penetrate: for AK being longer than\r\nBL, and parallel to it, it follows that the lines AB and KL, being\r\nprolonged, would meet at the side L. But the angle K is a right angle:\r\nhence KAB is necessarily acute, and consequently less than DAB. If one\r\ninvestigates in the same way the progression of the portion of the\r\nwave KL, one will find that after a further time it has arrived at MN\r\nin such a manner that the perpendiculars KM, LN, dip down even more\r\nthan do AK, BL. And this suffices to show that the ray will continue\r\nalong the curved line which intersects all the waves at right angles,\r\nas has been said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nON THE STRANGE REFRACTION OF ICELAND CRYSTAL\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\nThere is brought from Iceland, which is an Island in the North Sea, in\r\nthe latitude of 66 degrees, a kind of Crystal or transparent stone,\r\nvery remarkable for its figure and other qualities, but above all for\r\nits strange refractions. The causes of this have seemed to me to be\r\nworthy of being carefully investigated, the more so because amongst\r\ntransparent bodies this one alone does not follow the ordinary rules\r\nwith respect to rays of light. I have even been under some necessity\r\nto make this research, because the refractions of this Crystal seemed\r\nto overturn our preceding explanation of regular refraction; which\r\nexplanation, on the contrary, they strongly confirm, as will be seen\r\nafter they have been brought under the same principle. In Iceland are\r\nfound great lumps of this Crystal, some of which I have seen of 4 or 5\r\npounds. But it occurs also in other countries, for I have had some of\r\nthe same sort which had been found in France near the town of Troyes\r\nin Champagne, and some others which came from the Island of Corsica,\r\nthough both were less clear and only in little bits, scarcely capable\r\nof letting any effect of refraction be observed.\r\n\r\n2. The first knowledge which the public has had about it is due to Mr.\r\nErasmus Bartholinus, who has given a description of Iceland Crystal\r\nand of its chief phenomena. But here I shall not desist from giving my\r\nown, both for the instruction of those who may not have seen his book,\r\nand because as respects some of these phenomena there is a slight\r\ndifference between his observations and those which I have made: for I\r\nhave applied myself with great exactitude to examine these properties\r\nof refraction, in order to be quite sure before undertaking to explain\r\nthe causes of them.\r\n\r\n3. As regards the hardness of this stone, and the property which it\r\nhas of being easily split, it must be considered rather as a species\r\nof Talc than of Crystal. For an iron spike effects an entrance into it\r\nas easily as into any other Talc or Alabaster, to which it is equal in\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n4. The pieces of it which are found have the figure of an oblique\r\nparallelepiped; each of the six faces being a parallelogram; and it\r\nadmits of being split in three directions parallel to two of these\r\nopposed faces. Even in such wise, if you will, that all the six faces\r\nare equal and similar rhombuses. The figure here added represents a\r\npiece of this Crystal. The obtuse angles of all the parallelograms, as\r\nC, D, here, are angles of 101 degrees 52 minutes, and consequently\r\nthe acute angles, such as A and B, are of 78 degrees 8 minutes.\r\n\r\n5. Of the solid angles there are two opposite to one another, such as\r\nC and E, which are each composed of three equal obtuse plane angles.\r\nThe other six are composed of two acute angles and one obtuse. All\r\nthat I have just said has been likewise remarked by Mr. Bartholinus in\r\nthe aforesaid treatise; if we differ it is only slightly about the\r\nvalues of the angles. He recounts moreover some other properties of\r\nthis Crystal; to wit, that when rubbed against cloth it attracts\r\nstraws and other light things as do amber, diamond, glass, and Spanish\r\nwax. Let a piece be covered with water for a day or more, the surface\r\nloses its natural polish. When aquafortis is poured on it it produces\r\nebullition, especially, as I have found, if the Crystal has been\r\npulverized. I have also found by experiment that it may be heated to\r\nredness in the fire without being in anywise altered or rendered less\r\ntransparent; but a very violent fire calcines it nevertheless. Its\r\ntransparency is scarcely less than that of water or of Rock Crystal,\r\nand devoid of colour. But rays of light pass through it in another\r\nfashion and produce those marvellous refractions the causes of which I\r\nam now going to try to explain; reserving for the end of this Treatise\r\nthe statement of my conjectures touching the formation and\r\nextraordinary configuration of this Crystal.\r\n\r\n6. In all other transparent bodies that we know there is but one sole\r\nand simple refraction; but in this substance there are two different\r\nones. The effect is that objects seen through it, especially such as\r\nare placed right against it, appear double; and that a ray of\r\nsunlight, falling on one of its surfaces, parts itself into two rays\r\nand traverses the Crystal thus.\r\n\r\n7. It is again a general law in all other transparent bodies that the\r\nray which falls perpendicularly on their surface passes straight on\r\nwithout suffering refraction, and that an oblique ray is always\r\nrefracted. But in this Crystal the perpendicular ray suffers\r\nrefraction, and there are oblique rays which pass through it quite\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n8. But in order to explain these phenomena more particularly, let\r\nthere be, in the first place, a piece ABFE of the same Crystal, and\r\nlet the obtuse angle ACB, one of the three which constitute the\r\nequilateral solid angle C, be divided into two equal parts by the\r\nstraight line CG, and let it be conceived that the Crystal is\r\nintersected by a plane which passes through this line and through the\r\nside CF, which plane will necessarily be perpendicular to the surface\r\nAB; and its section in the Crystal will form a parallelogram GCFH. We\r\nwill call this section the principal section of the Crystal.\r\n\r\n9. Now if one covers the surface AB, leaving there only a small\r\naperture at the point K, situated in the straight line CG, and if one\r\nexposes it to the sun, so that his rays face it perpendicularly above,\r\nthen the ray IK will divide itself at the point K into two, one of\r\nwhich will continue to go on straight by KL, and the other will\r\nseparate itself along the straight line KM, which is in the plane\r\nGCFH, and which makes with KL an angle of about 6 degrees 40 minutes,\r\ntending from the side of the solid angle C; and on emerging from the\r\nother side of the Crystal it will turn again parallel to JK, along MZ.\r\nAnd as, in this extraordinary refraction, the point M is seen by the\r\nrefracted ray MKI, which I consider as going to the eye at I, it\r\nnecessarily follows that the point L, by virtue of the same\r\nrefraction, will be seen by the refracted ray LRI, so that LR will be\r\nparallel to MK if the distance from the eye KI is supposed very great.\r\nThe point L appears then as being in the straight line IRS; but the\r\nsame point appears also, by ordinary refraction, to be in the straight\r\nline IK, hence it is necessarily judged to be double. And similarly if\r\nL be a small hole in a sheet of paper or other substance which is laid\r\nagainst the Crystal, it will appear when turned towards daylight as if\r\nthere were two holes, which will seem the wider apart from one another\r\nthe greater the thickness of the Crystal.\r\n\r\n10. Again, if one turns the Crystal in such wise that an incident ray\r\nNO, of sunlight, which I suppose to be in the plane continued from\r\nGCFH, makes with GC an angle of 73 degrees and 20 minutes, and is\r\nconsequently nearly parallel to the edge CF, which makes with FH an\r\nangle of 70 degrees 57 minutes, according to the calculation which I\r\nshall put at the end, it will divide itself at the point O into two\r\nrays, one of which will continue along OP in a straight line with NO,\r\nand will similarly pass out of the other side of the crystal without\r\nany refraction; but the other will be refracted and will go along OQ.\r\nAnd it must be noted that it is special to the plane through GCF and\r\nto those which are parallel to it, that all incident rays which are in\r\none of these planes continue to be in it after they have entered the\r\nCrystal and have become double; for it is quite otherwise for rays in\r\nall other planes which intersect the Crystal, as we shall see\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\n11. I recognized at first by these experiments and by some others that\r\nof the two refractions which the ray suffers in this Crystal, there is\r\none which follows the ordinary rules; and it is this to which the rays\r\nKL and OQ belong. This is why I have distinguished this ordinary\r\nrefraction from the other; and having measured it by exact\r\nobservation, I found that its proportion, considered as to the Sines\r\nof the angles which the incident and refracted rays make with the\r\nperpendicular, was very precisely that of 5 to 3, as was found also by\r\nMr. Bartholinus, and consequently much greater than that of Rock\r\nCrystal, or of glass, which is nearly 3 to 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n12. The mode of making these observations exactly is as follows. Upon\r\na leaf of paper fixed on a thoroughly flat table there is traced a\r\nblack line AB, and two others, CED and KML, which cut it at right\r\nangles and are more or less distant from one another according as it\r\nis desired to examine a ray that is more or less oblique. Then place\r\nthe Crystal upon the intersection E so that the line AB concurs with\r\nthat which bisects the obtuse angle of the lower surface, or with some\r\nline parallel to it. Then by placing the eye directly above the line\r\nAB it will appear single only; and one will see that the portion\r\nviewed through the Crystal and the portions which appear outside it,\r\nmeet together in a straight line: but the line CD will appear double,\r\nand one can distinguish the image which is due to regular refraction\r\nby the circumstance that when one views it with both eyes it seems\r\nraised up more than the other, or again by the circumstance that, when\r\nthe Crystal is turned around on the paper, this image remains\r\nstationary, whereas the other image shifts and moves entirely around.\r\nAfterwards let the eye be placed at I (remaining always in the plane\r\nperpendicular through AB) so that it views the image which is formed\r\nby regular refraction of the line CD making a straight line with the\r\nremainder of that line which is outside the Crystal. And then, marking\r\non the surface of the Crystal the point H where the intersection E\r\nappears, this point will be directly above E. Then draw back the eye\r\ntowards O, keeping always in the plane perpendicular through AB, so\r\nthat the image of the line CD, which is formed by ordinary refraction,\r\nmay appear in a straight line with the line KL viewed without\r\nrefraction; and then mark on the Crystal the point N where the point\r\nof intersection E appears.\r\n\r\n13. Then one will know the length and position of the lines NH, EM,\r\nand of HE, which is the thickness of the Crystal: which lines being\r\ntraced separately upon a plan, and then joining NE and NM which cuts\r\nHE at P, the proportion of the refraction will be that of EN to NP,\r\nbecause these lines are to one another as the sines of the angles NPH,\r\nNEP, which are equal to those which the incident ray ON and its\r\nrefraction NE make with the perpendicular to the surface. This\r\nproportion, as I have said, is sufficiently precisely as 5 to 3, and\r\nis always the same for all inclinations of the incident ray.\r\n\r\n14. The same mode of observation has also served me for examining the\r\nextraordinary or irregular refraction of this Crystal. For, the point\r\nH having been found and marked, as aforesaid, directly above the point\r\nE, I observed the appearance of the line CD, which is made by the\r\nextraordinary refraction; and having placed the eye at Q, so that this\r\nappearance made a straight line with the line KL viewed without\r\nrefraction, I ascertained the triangles REH, RES, and consequently the\r\nangles RSH, RES, which the incident and the refracted ray make with\r\nthe perpendicular.\r\n\r\n15. But I found in this refraction that the ratio of FR to RS was not\r\nconstant, like the ordinary refraction, but that it varied with the\r\nvarying obliquity of the incident ray.\r\n\r\n16. I found also that when QRE made a straight line, that is, when the\r\nincident ray entered the Crystal without being refracted (as I\r\nascertained by the circumstance that then the point E viewed by the\r\nextraordinary refraction appeared in the line CD, as seen without\r\nrefraction) I found, I say, then that the angle QRG was 73 degrees 20\r\nminutes, as has been already remarked; and so it is not the ray\r\nparallel to the edge of the Crystal, which crosses it in a straight\r\nline without being refracted, as Mr. Bartholinus believed, since that\r\ninclination is only 70 degrees 57 minutes, as was stated above. And\r\nthis is to be noted, in order that no one may search in vain for the\r\ncause of the singular property of this ray in its parallelism to the\r\nedges mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n17. Finally, continuing my observations to discover the nature of\r\nthis refraction, I learned that it obeyed the following remarkable\r\nrule. Let the parallelogram GCFH, made by the principal section of the\r\nCrystal, as previously determined, be traced separately. I found then\r\nthat always, when the inclinations of two rays which come from\r\nopposite sides, as VK, SK here, are equal, their refractions KX and KT\r\nmeet the bottom line HF in such wise that points X and T are equally\r\ndistant from the point M, where the refraction of the perpendicular\r\nray IK falls; and this occurs also for refractions in other sections\r\nof this Crystal. But before speaking of those, which have also other\r\nparticular properties, we will investigate the causes of the phenomena\r\nwhich I have already reported.\r\n\r\nIt was after having explained the refraction of ordinary transparent\r\nbodies by means of the spherical emanations of light, as above, that I\r\nresumed my examination of the nature of this Crystal, wherein I had\r\npreviously been unable to discover anything.\r\n\r\n18. As there were two different refractions, I conceived that there\r\nwere also two different emanations of waves of light, and that one\r\ncould occur in the ethereal matter extending through the body of the\r\nCrystal. Which matter, being present in much larger quantity than is\r\nthat of the particles which compose it, was alone capable of causing\r\ntransparency, according to what has been explained heretofore. I\r\nattributed to this emanation of waves the regular refraction which is\r\nobserved in this stone, by supposing these waves to be ordinarily of\r\nspherical form, and having a slower progression within the Crystal\r\nthan they have outside it; whence proceeds refraction as I have\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\n19. As to the other emanation which should produce the irregular\r\nrefraction, I wished to try what Elliptical waves, or rather\r\nspheroidal waves, would do; and these I supposed would spread\r\nindifferently both in the ethereal matter diffused throughout the\r\ncrystal and in the particles of which it is composed, according to the\r\nlast mode in which I have explained transparency. It seemed to me that\r\nthe disposition or regular arrangement of these particles could\r\ncontribute to form spheroidal waves (nothing more being required for\r\nthis than that the successive movement of light should spread a little\r\nmore quickly in one direction than in the other) and I scarcely\r\ndoubted that there were in this crystal such an arrangement of equal\r\nand similar particles, because of its figure and of its angles with\r\ntheir determinate and invariable measure. Touching which particles,\r\nand their form and disposition, I shall, at the end of this Treatise,\r\npropound my conjectures and some experiments which confirm them.\r\n\r\n20. The double emission of waves of light, which I had imagined,\r\nbecame more probable to me after I had observed a certain phenomenon\r\nin the ordinary [Rock] Crystal, which occurs in hexagonal form, and\r\nwhich, because of this regularity, seems also to be composed of\r\nparticles, of definite figure, and ranged in order. This was, that\r\nthis crystal, as well as that from Iceland, has a double refraction,\r\nthough less evident. For having had cut from it some well polished\r\nPrisms of different sections, I remarked in all, in viewing through\r\nthem the flame of a candle or the lead of window panes, that\r\neverything appeared double, though with images not very distant from\r\none another. Whence I understood the reason why this substance, though\r\nso transparent, is useless for Telescopes, when they have ever so\r\nlittle length.\r\n\r\n21. Now this double refraction, according to my Theory hereinbefore\r\nestablished, seemed to demand a double emission of waves of light,\r\nboth of them spherical (for both the refractions are regular) and\r\nthose of one series a little slower only than the others. For thus the\r\nphenomenon is quite naturally explained, by postulating substances\r\nwhich serve as vehicle for these waves, as I have done in the case of\r\nIceland Crystal. I had then less trouble after that in admitting two\r\nemissions of waves in one and the same body. And since it might have\r\nbeen objected that in composing these two kinds of crystal of equal\r\nparticles of a certain figure, regularly piled, the interstices which\r\nthese particles leave and which contain the ethereal matter would\r\nscarcely suffice to transmit the waves of light which I have localized\r\nthere, I removed this difficulty by regarding these particles as being\r\nof a very rare texture, or rather as composed of other much smaller\r\nparticles, between which the ethereal matter passes quite freely.\r\nThis, moreover, necessarily follows from that which has been already\r\ndemonstrated touching the small quantity of matter of which the bodies\r\nare built up.\r\n\r\n22. Supposing then these spheroidal waves besides the spherical ones,\r\nI began to examine whether they could serve to explain the phenomena\r\nof the irregular refraction, and how by these same phenomena I could\r\ndetermine the figure and position of the spheroids: as to which I\r\nobtained at last the desired success, by proceeding as follows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n23. I considered first the effect of waves so formed, as respects the\r\nray which falls perpendicularly on the flat surface of a transparent\r\nbody in which they should spread in this manner. I took AB for the\r\nexposed region of the surface. And, since a ray perpendicular to a\r\nplane, and coming from a very distant source of light, is nothing\r\nelse, according to the precedent Theory, than the incidence of a\r\nportion of the wave parallel to that plane, I supposed the straight\r\nline RC, parallel and equal to AB, to be a portion of a wave of light,\r\nin which an infinitude of points such as RH_h_C come to meet the\r\nsurface AB at the points AK_k_B. Then instead of the hemispherical\r\npartial waves which in a body of ordinary refraction would spread from\r\neach of these last points, as we have above explained in treating of\r\nrefraction, these must here be hemi-spheroids. The axes (or rather the\r\nmajor diameters) of these I supposed to be oblique to the plane AB, as\r\nis AV the semi-axis or semi-major diameter of the spheroid SVT, which\r\nrepresents the partial wave coming from the point A, after the wave RC\r\nhas reached AB. I say axis or major diameter, because the same ellipse\r\nSVT may be considered as the section of a spheroid of which the axis\r\nis AZ perpendicular to AV. But, for the present, without yet deciding\r\none or other, we will consider these spheroids only in those sections\r\nof them which make ellipses in the plane of this figure. Now taking a\r\ncertain space of time during which the wave SVT has spread from A, it\r\nwould needs be that from all the other points K_k_B there should\r\nproceed, in the same time, waves similar to SVT and similarly\r\nsituated. And the common tangent NQ of all these semi-ellipses would\r\nbe the propagation of the wave RC which fell on AB, and would be the\r\nplace where this movement occurs in much greater amount than anywhere\r\nelse, being made up of arcs of an infinity of ellipses, the centres of\r\nwhich are along the line AB.\r\n\r\n24. Now it appeared that this common tangent NQ was parallel to AB,\r\nand of the same length, but that it was not directly opposite to it,\r\nsince it was comprised between the lines AN, BQ, which are diameters\r\nof ellipses having A and B for centres, conjugate with respect to\r\ndiameters which are not in the straight line AB. And in this way I\r\ncomprehended, a matter which had seemed to me very difficult, how a\r\nray perpendicular to a surface could suffer refraction on entering a\r\ntransparent body; seeing that the wave RC, having come to the aperture\r\nAB, went on forward thence, spreading between the parallel lines AN,\r\nBQ, yet itself remaining always parallel to AB, so that here the light\r\ndoes not spread along lines perpendicular to its waves, as in ordinary\r\nrefraction, but along lines cutting the waves obliquely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n25. Inquiring subsequently what might be the position and form of\r\nthese spheroids in the crystal, I considered that all the six faces\r\nproduced precisely the same refractions. Taking, then, the\r\nparallelopiped AFB, of which the obtuse solid angle C is contained\r\nbetween the three equal plane angles, and imagining in it the three\r\nprincipal sections, one of which is perpendicular to the face DC and\r\npasses through the edge CF, another perpendicular to the face BF\r\npassing through the edge CA, and the third perpendicular to the face\r\nAF passing through the edge BC; I knew that the refractions of the\r\nincident rays belonging to these three planes were all similar. But\r\nthere could be no position of the spheroid which would have the same\r\nrelation to these three sections except that in which the axis was\r\nalso the axis of the solid angle C. Consequently I saw that the axis\r\nof this angle, that is to say the straight line which traversed the\r\ncrystal from the point C with equal inclination to the edges CF, CA,\r\nCB was the line which determined the position of the axis of all the\r\nspheroidal waves which one imagined to originate from some point,\r\ntaken within or on the surface of the crystal, since all these\r\nspheroids ought to be alike, and have their axes parallel to one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n26. Considering after this the plane of one of these three sections,\r\nnamely that through GCF, the angle of which is 109 degrees 3 minutes,\r\nsince the angle F was shown above to be 70 degrees 57 minutes; and,\r\nimagining a spheroidal wave about the centre C, I knew, because I have\r\njust explained it, that its axis must be in the same plane, the half\r\nof which axis I have marked CS in the next figure: and seeking by\r\ncalculation (which will be given with others at the end of this\r\ndiscourse) the value of the angle CGS, I found it 45 degrees 20\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n27. To know from this the form of this spheroid, that is to say the\r\nproportion of the semi-diameters CS, CP, of its elliptical section,\r\nwhich are perpendicular to one another, I considered that the point M\r\nwhere the ellipse is touched by the straight line FH, parallel to CG,\r\nought to be so situated that CM makes with the perpendicular CL an\r\nangle of 6 degrees 40 minutes; since, this being so, this ellipse\r\nsatisfies what has been said about the refraction of the ray\r\nperpendicular to the surface CG, which is inclined to the\r\nperpendicular CL by the same angle. This, then, being thus disposed,\r\nand taking CM at 100,000 parts, I found by the calculation which will\r\nbe given at the end, the semi-major diameter CP to be 105,032, and the\r\nsemi-axis CS to be 93,410, the ratio of which numbers is very nearly 9\r\nto 8; so that the spheroid was of the kind which resembles a\r\ncompressed sphere, being generated by the revolution of an ellipse\r\nabout its smaller diameter. I found also the value of CG the\r\nsemi-diameter parallel to the tangent ML to be 98,779.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n28. Now passing to the investigation of the refractions which\r\nobliquely incident rays must undergo, according to our hypothesis of\r\nspheroidal waves, I saw that these refractions depended on the ratio\r\nbetween the velocity of movement of the light outside the crystal in\r\nthe ether, and that within the crystal. For supposing, for example,\r\nthis proportion to be such that while the light in the crystal forms\r\nthe spheroid GSP, as I have just said, it forms outside a sphere the\r\nsemi-diameter of which is equal to the line N which will be determined\r\nhereafter, the following is the way of finding the refraction of the\r\nincident rays. Let there be such a ray RC falling upon the surface\r\nCK. Make CO perpendicular to RC, and across the angle KCO adjust OK,\r\nequal to N and perpendicular to CO; then draw KI, which touches the\r\nEllipse GSP, and from the point of contact I join IC, which will be\r\nthe required refraction of the ray RC. The demonstration of this is,\r\nit will be seen, entirely similar to that of which we made use in\r\nexplaining ordinary refraction. For the refraction of the ray RC is\r\nnothing else than the progression of the portion C of the wave CO,\r\ncontinued in the crystal. Now the portions H of this wave, during the\r\ntime that O came to K, will have arrived at the surface CK along the\r\nstraight lines H_x_, and will moreover have produced in the crystal\r\naround the centres _x_ some hemi-spheroidal partial waves similar to\r\nthe hemi-spheroidal GSP_g_, and similarly disposed, and of which the\r\nmajor and minor diameters will bear the same proportions to the lines\r\n_xv_ (the continuations of the lines H_x_ up to KB parallel to CO)\r\nthat the diameters of the spheroid GSP_g_ bear to the line CB, or N.\r\nAnd it is quite easy to see that the common tangent of all these\r\nspheroids, which are here represented by Ellipses, will be the\r\nstraight line IK, which consequently will be the propagation of the\r\nwave CO; and the point I will be that of the point C, conformably with\r\nthat which has been demonstrated in ordinary refraction.\r\n\r\nNow as to finding the point of contact I, it is known that one must\r\nfind CD a third proportional to the lines CK, CG, and draw DI parallel\r\nto CM, previously determined, which is the conjugate diameter to CG;\r\nfor then, by drawing KI it touches the Ellipse at I.\r\n\r\n29. Now as we have found CI the refraction of the ray RC, similarly\r\none will find C_i_ the refraction of the ray _r_C, which comes from\r\nthe opposite side, by making C_o_ perpendicular to _r_C and following\r\nout the rest of the construction as before. Whence one sees that if\r\nthe ray _r_C is inclined equally with RC, the line C_d_ will\r\nnecessarily be equal to CD, because C_k_ is equal to CK, and C_g_ to\r\nCG. And in consequence I_i_ will be cut at E into equal parts by the\r\nline CM, to which DI and _di_ are parallel. And because CM is the\r\nconjugate diameter to CG, it follows that _i_I will be parallel to\r\n_g_G. Therefore if one prolongs the refracted rays CI, C_i_, until\r\nthey meet the tangent ML at T and _t_, the distances MT, M_t_, will\r\nalso be equal. And so, by our hypothesis, we explain perfectly the\r\nphenomenon mentioned above; to wit, that when there are two rays\r\nequally inclined, but coming from opposite sides, as here the rays RC,\r\n_rc_, their refractions diverge equally from the line followed by the\r\nrefraction of the ray perpendicular to the surface, by considering\r\nthese divergences in the direction parallel to the surface of the\r\ncrystal.\r\n\r\n30. To find the length of the line N, in proportion to CP, CS, CG, it\r\nmust be determined by observations of the irregular refraction which\r\noccurs in this section of the crystal; and I find thus that the ratio\r\nof N to GC is just a little less than 8 to 5. And having regard to\r\nsome other observations and phenomena of which I shall speak\r\nafterwards, I put N at 156,962 parts, of which the semi-diameter CG is\r\nfound to contain 98,779, making this ratio 8 to 5-1/29. Now this\r\nproportion, which there is between the line N and CG, may be called\r\nthe Proportion of the Refraction; similarly as in glass that of 3 to\r\n2, as will be manifest when I shall have explained a short process in\r\nthe preceding way to find the irregular refractions.\r\n\r\n31. Supposing then, in the next figure, as previously, the surface of\r\nthe crystal _g_G, the Ellipse GP_g_, and the line N; and CM the\r\nrefraction of the perpendicular ray FC, from which it diverges by 6\r\ndegrees 40 minutes. Now let there be some other ray RC, the refraction\r\nof which must be found.\r\n\r\nAbout the centre C, with semi-diameter CG, let the circumference _g_RG\r\nbe described, cutting the ray RC at R; and let RV be the perpendicular\r\non CG. Then as the line N is to CG let CV be to CD, and let DI be\r\ndrawn parallel to CM, cutting the Ellipse _g_MG at I; then joining CI,\r\nthis will be the required refraction of the ray RC. Which is\r\ndemonstrated thus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet CO be perpendicular to CR, and across the angle OCG let OK be\r\nadjusted, equal to N and perpendicular to CO, and let there be drawn\r\nthe straight line KI, which if it is demonstrated to be a tangent to\r\nthe Ellipse at I, it will be evident by the things heretofore\r\nexplained that CI is the refraction of the ray RC. Now since the angle\r\nRCO is a right angle, it is easy to see that the right-angled\r\ntriangles RCV, KCO, are similar. As then, CK is to KO, so also is RC\r\nto CV. But KO is equal to N, and RC to CG: then as CK is to N so will\r\nCG be to CV. But as N is to CG, so, by construction, is CV to CD. Then\r\nas CK is to CG so is CG to CD. And because DI is parallel to CM, the\r\nconjugate diameter to CG, it follows that KI touches the Ellipse at I;\r\nwhich remained to be shown.\r\n\r\n32. One sees then that as there is in the refraction of ordinary\r\nmedia a certain constant proportion between the sines of the angles\r\nwhich the incident ray and the refracted ray make with the\r\nperpendicular, so here there is such a proportion between CV and CD or\r\nIE; that is to say between the Sine of the angle which the incident\r\nray makes with the perpendicular, and the horizontal intercept, in the\r\nEllipse, between the refraction of this ray and the diameter CM. For\r\nthe ratio of CV to CD is, as has been said, the same as that of N to\r\nthe semi-diameter CG.\r\n\r\n33. I will add here, before passing away, that in comparing together\r\nthe regular and irregular refraction of this crystal, there is this\r\nremarkable fact, that if ABPS be the spheroid by which light spreads\r\nin the Crystal in a certain space of time (which spreading, as has\r\nbeen said, serves for the irregular refraction), then the inscribed\r\nsphere BVST is the extension in the same space of time of the light\r\nwhich serves for the regular refraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor we have stated before this, that the line N being the radius of a\r\nspherical wave of light in air, while in the crystal it spread through\r\nthe spheroid ABPS, the ratio of N to CS will be 156,962 to 93,410. But\r\nit has also been stated that the proportion of the regular refraction\r\nwas 5 to 3; that is to say, that N being the radius of a spherical\r\nwave of light in air, its extension in the crystal would, in the same\r\nspace of time, form a sphere the radius of which would be to N as 3 to\r\n5. Now 156,962 is to 93,410 as 5 to 3 less 1/41. So that it is\r\nsufficiently nearly, and may be exactly, the sphere BVST, which the\r\nlight describes for the regular refraction in the crystal, while it\r\ndescribes the spheroid BPSA for the irregular refraction, and while it\r\ndescribes the sphere of radius N in air outside the crystal.\r\n\r\nAlthough then there are, according to what we have supposed, two\r\ndifferent propagations of light within the crystal, it appears that it\r\nis only in directions perpendicular to the axis BS of the spheroid\r\nthat one of these propagations occurs more rapidly than the other; but\r\nthat they have an equal velocity in the other direction, namely, in\r\nthat parallel to the same axis BS, which is also the axis of the\r\nobtuse angle of the crystal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n34. The proportion of the refraction being what we have just seen, I\r\nwill now show that there necessarily follows thence that notable\r\nproperty of the ray which falling obliquely on the surface of the\r\ncrystal enters it without suffering refraction. For supposing the same\r\nthings as before, and that the ray makes with the same surface _g_G\r\nthe angle RCG of 73 degrees 20 minutes, inclining to the same side as\r\nthe crystal (of which ray mention has been made above); if one\r\ninvestigates, by the process above explained, the refraction CI, one\r\nwill find that it makes exactly a straight line with RC, and that thus\r\nthis ray is not deviated at all, conformably with experiment. This is\r\nproved as follows by calculation.\r\n\r\nCG or CR being, as precedently, 98,779; CM being 100,000; and the\r\nangle RCV 73 degrees 20 minutes, CV will be 28,330. But because CI is\r\nthe refraction of the ray RC, the proportion of CV to CD is 156,962 to\r\n98,779, namely, that of N to CG; then CD is 17,828.\r\n\r\nNow the rectangle _g_DC is to the square of DI as the square of CG is\r\nto the square of CM; hence DI or CE will be 98,353. But as CE is to\r\nEI, so will CM be to MT, which will then be 18,127. And being added to\r\nML, which is 11,609 (namely the sine of the angle LCM, which is 6\r\ndegrees 40 minutes, taking CM 100,000 as radius) we get LT 27,936; and\r\nthis is to LC 99,324 as CV to VR, that is to say, as 29,938, the\r\ntangent of the complement of the angle RCV, which is 73 degrees 20\r\nminutes, is to the radius of the Tables. Whence it appears that RCIT\r\nis a straight line; which was to be proved.\r\n\r\n35. Further it will be seen that the ray CI in emerging through the\r\nopposite surface of the crystal, ought to pass out quite straight,\r\naccording to the following demonstration, which proves that the\r\nreciprocal relation of refraction obtains in this crystal the same as\r\nin other transparent bodies; that is to say, that if a ray RC in\r\nmeeting the surface of the crystal CG is refracted as CI, the ray CI\r\nemerging through the opposite parallel surface of the crystal, which\r\nI suppose to be IB, will have its refraction IA parallel to the ray\r\nRC.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet the same things be supposed as before; that is to say, let CO,\r\nperpendicular to CR, represent a portion of a wave the continuation of\r\nwhich in the crystal is IK, so that the piece C will be continued on\r\nalong the straight line CI, while O comes to K. Now if one takes a\r\nsecond period of time equal to the first, the piece K of the wave IK\r\nwill, in this second period, have advanced along the straight line KB,\r\nequal and parallel to CI, because every piece of the wave CO, on\r\narriving at the surface CK, ought to go on in the crystal the same as\r\nthe piece C; and in this same time there will be formed in the air\r\nfrom the point I a partial spherical wave having a semi-diameter IA\r\nequal to KO, since KO has been traversed in an equal time. Similarly,\r\nif one considers some other point of the wave IK, such as _h_, it will\r\ngo along _hm_, parallel to CI, to meet the surface IB, while the point\r\nK traverses K_l_ equal to _hm_; and while this accomplishes the\r\nremainder _l_B, there will start from the point _m_ a partial wave the\r\nsemi-diameter of which, _mn_, will have the same ratio to _l_B as IA\r\nto KB. Whence it is evident that this wave of semi-diameter _mn_, and\r\nthe other of semi-diameter IA will have the same tangent BA. And\r\nsimilarly for all the partial spherical waves which will be formed\r\noutside the crystal by the impact of all the points of the wave IK\r\nagainst the surface of the Ether IB. It is then precisely the tangent\r\nBA which will be the continuation of the wave IK, outside the crystal,\r\nwhen the piece K has reached B. And in consequence IA, which is\r\nperpendicular to BA, will be the refraction of the ray CI on emerging\r\nfrom the crystal. Now it is clear that IA is parallel to the incident\r\nray RC, since IB is equal to CK, and IA equal to KO, and the angles A\r\nand O are right angles.\r\n\r\nIt is seen then that, according to our hypothesis, the reciprocal\r\nrelation of refraction holds good in this crystal as well as in\r\nordinary transparent bodies; as is thus in fact found by observation.\r\n\r\n36. I pass now to the consideration of other sections of the crystal,\r\nand of the refractions there produced, on which, as will be seen, some\r\nother very remarkable phenomena depend.\r\n\r\nLet ABH be a parallelepiped of crystal, and let the top surface AEHF\r\nbe a perfect rhombus, the obtuse angles of which are equally divided\r\nby the straight line EF, and the acute angles by the straight line AH\r\nperpendicular to FE.\r\n\r\nThe section which we have hitherto considered is that which passes\r\nthrough the lines EF, EB, and which at the same time cuts the plane\r\nAEHF at right angles. Refractions in this section have this in common\r\nwith the refractions in ordinary media that the plane which is drawn\r\nthrough the incident ray and which also intersects the surface of the\r\ncrystal at right angles, is that in which the refracted ray also is\r\nfound. But the refractions which appertain to every other section of\r\nthis crystal have this strange property that the refracted ray always\r\nquits the plane of the incident ray perpendicular to the surface, and\r\nturns away towards the side of the slope of the crystal. For which\r\nfact we shall show the reason, in the first place, for the section\r\nthrough AH; and we shall show at the same time how one can determine\r\nthe refraction, according to our hypothesis. Let there be, then, in\r\nthe plane which passes through AH, and which is perpendicular to the\r\nplane AFHE, the incident ray RC; it is required to find its refraction\r\nin the crystal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n37. About the centre C, which I suppose to be in the intersection of\r\nAH and FE, let there be imagined a hemi-spheroid QG_qg_M, such as the\r\nlight would form in spreading in the crystal, and let its section by\r\nthe plane AEHF form the Ellipse QG_qg_, the major diameter of which\r\nQ_q_, which is in the line AH, will necessarily be one of the major\r\ndiameters of the spheroid; because the axis of the spheroid being in\r\nthe plane through FEB, to which QC is perpendicular, it follows that\r\nQC is also perpendicular to the axis of the spheroid, and consequently\r\nQC_q_ one of its major diameters. But the minor diameter of this\r\nEllipse, G_g_, will bear to Q_q_ the proportion which has been defined\r\npreviously, Article 27, between CG and the major semi-diameter of the\r\nspheroid, CP, namely, that of 98,779 to 105,032.\r\n\r\nLet the line N be the length of the travel of light in air during the\r\ntime in which, within the crystal, it makes, from the centre C, the\r\nspheroid QC_qg_M. Then having drawn CO perpendicular to the ray CR and\r\nsituate in the plane through CR and AH, let there be adjusted, across\r\nthe angle ACO, the straight line OK equal to N and perpendicular to\r\nCO, and let it meet the straight line AH at K. Supposing consequently\r\nthat CL is perpendicular to the surface of the crystal AEHF, and that\r\nCM is the refraction of the ray which falls perpendicularly on this\r\nsame surface, let there be drawn a plane through the line CM and\r\nthrough KCH, making in the spheroid the semi-ellipse QM_q_, which will\r\nbe given, since the angle MCL is given of value 6 degrees 40 minutes.\r\nAnd it is certain, according to what has been explained above, Article\r\n27, that a plane which would touch the spheroid at the point M, where\r\nI suppose the straight line CM to meet the surface, would be parallel\r\nto the plane QG_q_. If then through the point K one now draws KS\r\nparallel to G_g_, which will be parallel also to QX, the tangent to\r\nthe Ellipse QG_q_ at Q; and if one conceives a plane passing through\r\nKS and touching the spheroid, the point of contact will necessarily be\r\nin the Ellipse QM_q_, because this plane through KS, as well as the\r\nplane which touches the spheroid at the point M, are parallel to QX,\r\nthe tangent of the spheroid: for this consequence will be demonstrated\r\nat the end of this Treatise. Let this point of contact be at I, then\r\nmaking KC, QC, DC proportionals, draw DI parallel to CM; also join CI.\r\nI say that CI will be the required refraction of the ray RC. This will\r\nbe manifest if, in considering CO, which is perpendicular to the ray\r\nRC, as a portion of the wave of light, we can demonstrate that the\r\ncontinuation of its piece C will be found in the crystal at I, when O\r\nhas arrived at K.\r\n\r\n38. Now as in the Chapter on Reflexion, in demonstrating that the\r\nincident and reflected rays are always in the same plane perpendicular\r\nto the reflecting surface, we considered the breadth of the wave of\r\nlight, so, similarly, we must here consider the breadth of the wave CO\r\nin the diameter G_g_. Taking then the breadth C_c_ on the side toward\r\nthe angle E, let the parallelogram CO_oc_ be taken as a portion of a\r\nwave, and let us complete the parallelograms CK_kc_, CI_ic_, Kl_ik_,\r\nOK_ko_. In the time then that the line O_o_ arrives at the surface of\r\nthe crystal at K_k_, all the points of the wave CO_oc_ will have\r\narrived at the rectangle K_c_ along lines parallel to OK; and from the\r\npoints of their incidences there will originate, beyond that, in the\r\ncrystal partial hemi-spheroids, similar to the hemi-spheroid QM_q_,\r\nand similarly disposed. These hemi-spheroids will necessarily all\r\ntouch the plane of the parallelogram KI_ik_ at the same instant that\r\nO_o_ has reached K_k_. Which is easy to comprehend, since, of these\r\nhemi-spheroids, all those which have their centres along the line CK,\r\ntouch this plane in the line KI (for this is to be shown in the same\r\nway as we have demonstrated the refraction of the oblique ray in the\r\nprincipal section through EF) and all those which have their centres\r\nin the line C_c_ will touch the same plane KI in the line I_i_; all\r\nthese being similar to the hemi-spheroid QM_q_. Since then the\r\nparallelogram K_i_ is that which touches all these spheroids, this\r\nsame parallelogram will be precisely the continuation of the wave\r\nCO_oc_ in the crystal, when O_o_ has arrived at K_k_, because it forms\r\nthe termination of the movement and because of the quantity of\r\nmovement which occurs more there than anywhere else: and thus it\r\nappears that the piece C of the wave CO_oc_ has its continuation at I;\r\nthat is to say, that the ray RC is refracted as CI.\r\n\r\nFrom this it is to be noted that the proportion of the refraction for\r\nthis section of the crystal is that of the line N to the semi-diameter\r\nCQ; by which one will easily find the refractions of all incident\r\nrays, in the same way as we have shown previously for the case of the\r\nsection through FE; and the demonstration will be the same. But it\r\nappears that the said proportion of the refraction is less here than\r\nin the section through FEB; for it was there the same as the ratio of\r\nN to CG, that is to say, as 156,962 to 98,779, very nearly as 8 to 5;\r\nand here it is the ratio of N to CQ the major semi-diameter of the\r\nspheroid, that is to say, as 156,962 to 105,032, very nearly as 3 to\r\n2, but just a little less. Which still agrees perfectly with what one\r\nfinds by observation.\r\n\r\n39. For the rest, this diversity of proportion of refraction produces\r\na very singular effect in this Crystal; which is that when it is\r\nplaced upon a sheet of paper on which there are letters or anything\r\nelse marked, if one views it from above with the two eyes situated in\r\nthe plane of the section through EF, one sees the letters raised up by\r\nthis irregular refraction more than when one puts one's eyes in the\r\nplane of section through AH: and the difference of these elevations\r\nappears by comparison with the other ordinary refraction of the\r\ncrystal, the proportion of which is as 5 to 3, and which always raises\r\nthe letters equally, and higher than the irregular refraction does.\r\nFor one sees the letters and the paper on which they are written, as\r\non two different stages at the same time; and in the first position of\r\nthe eyes, namely, when they are in the plane through AH these two\r\nstages are four times more distant from one another than when the eyes\r\nare in the plane through EF.\r\n\r\nWe will show that this effect follows from the refractions; and it\r\nwill enable us at the same time to ascertain the apparent place of a\r\npoint of an object placed immediately under the crystal, according to\r\nthe different situation of the eyes.\r\n\r\n40. Let us see first by how much the irregular refraction of the plane\r\nthrough AH ought to lift the bottom of the crystal. Let the plane of\r\nthis figure represent separately the section through Q_q_ and CL, in\r\nwhich section there is also the ray RC, and let the semi-elliptic\r\nplane through Q_q_ and CM be inclined to the former, as previously, by\r\nan angle of 6 degrees 40 minutes; and in this plane CI is then the\r\nrefraction of the ray RC.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf now one considers the point I as at the bottom of the crystal, and\r\nthat it is viewed by the rays ICR, _Icr_, refracted equally at the\r\npoints C_c_, which should be equally distant from D, and that these\r\nrays meet the two eyes at R_r_; it is certain that the point I will\r\nappear raised to S where the straight lines RC, _rc_, meet; which\r\npoint S is in DP, perpendicular to Q_q_. And if upon DP there is drawn\r\nthe perpendicular IP, which will lie at the bottom of the crystal, the\r\nlength SP will be the apparent elevation of the point I above the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nLet there be described on Q_q_ a semicircle cutting the ray CR at B,\r\nfrom which BV is drawn perpendicular to Q_q_; and let the proportion\r\nof the refraction for this section be, as before, that of the line N\r\nto the semi-diameter CQ.\r\n\r\nThen as N is to CQ so is VC to CD, as appears by the method of finding\r\nthe refraction which we have shown above, Article 31; but as VC is to\r\nCD, so is VB to DS. Then as N is to CQ, so is VB to DS. Let ML be\r\nperpendicular to CL. And because I suppose the eyes R_r_ to be distant\r\nabout a foot or so from the crystal, and consequently the angle RS_r_\r\nvery small, VB may be considered as equal to the semi-diameter CQ, and\r\nDP as equal to CL; then as N is to CQ so is CQ to DS. But N is valued\r\nat 156,962 parts, of which CM contains 100,000 and CQ 105,032. Then DS\r\nwill have 70,283. But CL is 99,324, being the sine of the complement\r\nof the angle MCL which is 6 degrees 40 minutes; CM being supposed as\r\nradius. Then DP, considered as equal to CL, will be to DS as 99,324 to\r\n70,283. And so the elevation of the point I by the refraction of this\r\nsection is known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n41. Now let there be represented the other section through EF in the\r\nfigure before the preceding one; and let CM_g_ be the semi-ellipse,\r\nconsidered in Articles 27 and 28, which is made by cutting a\r\nspheroidal wave having centre C. Let the point I, taken in this\r\nellipse, be imagined again at the bottom of the Crystal; and let it be\r\nviewed by the refracted rays ICR, I_cr_, which go to the two eyes; CR\r\nand _cr_ being equally inclined to the surface of the crystal G_g_.\r\nThis being so, if one draws ID parallel to CM, which I suppose to be\r\nthe refraction of the perpendicular ray incident at the point C, the\r\ndistances DC, D_c_, will be equal, as is easy to see by that which has\r\nbeen demonstrated in Article 28. Now it is certain that the point I\r\nshould appear at S where the straight lines RC, _rc_, meet when\r\nprolonged; and that this point will fall in the line DP perpendicular\r\nto G_g_. If one draws IP perpendicular to this DP, it will be the\r\ndistance PS which will mark the apparent elevation of the point I. Let\r\nthere be described on G_g_ a semicircle cutting CR at B, from which\r\nlet BV be drawn perpendicular to G_g_; and let N to GC be the\r\nproportion of the refraction in this section, as in Article 28. Since\r\nthen CI is the refraction of the radius BC, and DI is parallel to CM,\r\nVC must be to CD as N to GC, according to what has been demonstrated\r\nin Article 31. But as VC is to CD so is BV to DS. Let ML be drawn\r\nperpendicular to CL. And because I consider, again, the eyes to be\r\ndistant above the crystal, BV is deemed equal to the semi-diameter CG;\r\nand hence DS will be a third proportional to the lines N and CG: also\r\nDP will be deemed equal to CL. Now CG consisting of 98,778 parts, of\r\nwhich CM contains 100,000, N is taken as 156,962. Then DS will be\r\n62,163. But CL is also determined, and contains 99,324 parts, as has\r\nbeen said in Articles 34 and 40. Then the ratio of PD to DS will be as\r\n99,324 to 62,163. And thus one knows the elevation of the point at the\r\nbottom I by the refraction of this section; and it appears that this\r\nelevation is greater than that by the refraction of the preceding\r\nsection, since the ratio of PD to DS was there as 99,324 to 70,283.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut by the regular refraction of the crystal, of which we have above\r\nsaid that the proportion is 5 to 3, the elevation of the point I, or\r\nP, from the bottom, will be 2/5 of the height DP; as appears by this\r\nfigure, where the point P being viewed by the rays PCR, P_cr_,\r\nrefracted equally at the surface C_c_, this point must needs appear\r\nto be at S, in the perpendicular PD where the lines RC, _rc_, meet\r\nwhen prolonged: and one knows that the line PC is to CS as 5 to 3,\r\nsince they are to one another as the sine of the angle CSP or DSC is\r\nto the sine of the angle SPC. And because the ratio of PD to DS is\r\ndeemed the same as that of PC to CS, the two eyes Rr being supposed\r\nvery far above the crystal, the elevation PS will thus be 2/5 of PD.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n42. If one takes a straight line AB for the thickness of the crystal,\r\nits point B being at the bottom, and if one divides it at the points\r\nC, D, E, according to the proportions of the elevations found, making\r\nAE 3/5 of AB, AB to AC as 99,324 to 70,283, and AB to AD as 99,324 to\r\n62,163, these points will divide AB as in this figure. And it will be\r\nfound that this agrees perfectly with experiment; that is to say by\r\nplacing the eyes above in the plane which cuts the crystal according\r\nto the shorter diameter of the rhombus, the regular refraction will\r\nlift up the letters to E; and one will see the bottom, and the letters\r\nover which it is placed, lifted up to D by the irregular refraction.\r\nBut by placing the eyes above in the plane which cuts the crystal\r\naccording to the longer diameter of the rhombus, the regular\r\nrefraction will lift the letters to E as before; but the irregular\r\nrefraction will make them, at the same time, appear lifted up only to\r\nC; and in such a way that the interval CE will be quadruple the\r\ninterval ED, which one previously saw.\r\n\r\n\r\n43. I have only to make the remark here that in both the positions of\r\nthe eyes the images caused by the irregular refraction do not appear\r\ndirectly below those which proceed from the regular refraction, but\r\nthey are separated from them by being more distant from the\r\nequilateral solid angle of the Crystal. That follows, indeed, from all\r\nthat has been hitherto demonstrated about the irregular refraction;\r\nand it is particularly shown by these last demonstrations, from which\r\none sees that the point I appears by irregular refraction at S in the\r\nperpendicular line DP, in which line also the image of the point P\r\nought to appear by regular refraction, but not the image of the point\r\nI, which will be almost directly above the same point, and higher than\r\nS.\r\n\r\nBut as to the apparent elevation of the point I in other positions of\r\nthe eyes above the crystal, besides the two positions which we have\r\njust examined, the image of that point by the irregular refraction\r\nwill always appear between the two heights of D and C, passing from\r\none to the other as one turns one's self around about the immovable\r\ncrystal, while looking down from above. And all this is still found\r\nconformable to our hypothesis, as any one can assure himself after I\r\nshall have shown here the way of finding the irregular refractions\r\nwhich appear in all other sections of the crystal, besides the two\r\nwhich we have considered. Let us suppose one of the faces of the\r\ncrystal, in which let there be the Ellipse HDE, the centre C of which\r\nis also the centre of the spheroid HME in which the light spreads, and\r\nof which the said Ellipse is the section. And let the incident ray be\r\nRC, the refraction of which it is required to find.\r\n\r\nLet there be taken a plane passing through the ray RC and which is\r\nperpendicular to the plane of the ellipse HDE, cutting it along the\r\nstraight line BCK; and having in the same plane through RC made CO\r\nperpendicular to CR, let OK be adjusted across the angle OCK, so as\r\nto be perpendicular to OC and equal to the line N, which I suppose to\r\nmeasure the travel of the light in air during the time that it spreads\r\nin the crystal through the spheroid HDEM. Then in the plane of the\r\nEllipse HDE let KT be drawn, through the point K, perpendicular to\r\nBCK. Now if one conceives a plane drawn through the straight line KT\r\nand touching the spheroid HME at I, the straight line CI will be the\r\nrefraction of the ray RC, as is easy to deduce from that which has\r\nbeen demonstrated in Article 36.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut it must be shown how one can determine the point of contact I. Let\r\nthere be drawn parallel to the line KT a line HF which touches the\r\nEllipse HDE, and let this point of contact be at H. And having drawn a\r\nstraight line along CH to meet KT at T, let there be imagined a plane\r\npassing through the same CH and through CM (which I suppose to be the\r\nrefraction of the perpendicular ray), which makes in the spheroid the\r\nelliptical section HME. It is certain that the plane which will pass\r\nthrough the straight line KT, and which will touch the spheroid, will\r\ntouch it at a point in the Ellipse HME, according to the Lemma which\r\nwill be demonstrated at the end of the Chapter. Now this point is\r\nnecessarily the point I which is sought, since the plane drawn through\r\nTK can touch the spheroid at one point only. And this point I is easy\r\nto determine, since it is needful only to draw from the point T, which\r\nis in the plane of this Ellipse, the tangent TI, in the way shown\r\npreviously. For the Ellipse HME is given, and its conjugate\r\nsemi-diameters are CH and CM; because a straight line drawn through M,\r\nparallel to HE, touches the Ellipse HME, as follows from the fact that\r\na plane taken through M, and parallel to the plane HDE, touches the\r\nspheroid at that point M, as is seen from Articles 27 and 23. For the\r\nrest, the position of this ellipse, with respect to the plane through\r\nthe ray RC and through CK, is also given; from which it will be easy\r\nto find the position of CI, the refraction corresponding to the ray\r\nRC.\r\n\r\nNow it must be noted that the same ellipse HME serves to find the\r\nrefractions of any other ray which may be in the plane through RC and\r\nCK. Because every plane, parallel to the straight line HF, or TK,\r\nwhich will touch the spheroid, will touch it in this ellipse,\r\naccording to the Lemma quoted a little before.\r\n\r\nI have investigated thus, in minute detail, the properties of the\r\nirregular refraction of this Crystal, in order to see whether each\r\nphenomenon that is deduced from our hypothesis accords with that which\r\nis observed in fact. And this being so it affords no slight proof of\r\nthe truth of our suppositions and principles. But what I am going to\r\nadd here confirms them again marvellously. It is this: that there are\r\ndifferent sections of this Crystal, the surfaces of which, thereby\r\nproduced, give rise to refractions precisely such as they ought to be,\r\nand as I had foreseen them, according to the preceding Theory.\r\n\r\nIn order to explain what these sections are, let ABKF _be_ the\r\nprincipal section through the axis of the crystal ACK, in which there\r\nwill also be the axis SS of a spheroidal wave of light spreading in\r\nthe crystal from the centre C; and the straight line which cuts SS\r\nthrough the middle and at right angles, namely PP, will be one of the\r\nmajor diameters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: {Section ABKF}]\r\n\r\nNow as in the natural section of the crystal, made by a plane parallel\r\nto two opposite faces, which plane is here represented by the line GG,\r\nthe refraction of the surfaces which are produced by it will be\r\ngoverned by the hemi-spheroids GNG, according to what has been\r\nexplained in the preceding Theory. Similarly, cutting the Crystal\r\nthrough NN, by a plane perpendicular to the parallelogram ABKF, the\r\nrefraction of the surfaces will be governed by the hemi-spheroids NGN.\r\nAnd if one cuts it through PP, perpendicularly to the said\r\nparallelogram, the refraction of the surfaces ought to be governed by\r\nthe hemi-spheroids PSP, and so for others. But I saw that if the plane\r\nNN was almost perpendicular to the plane GG, making the angle NCG,\r\nwhich is on the side A, an angle of 90 degrees 40 minutes, the\r\nhemi-spheroids NGN would become similar to the hemi-spheroids GNG,\r\nsince the planes NN and GG were equally inclined by an angle of 45\r\ndegrees 20 minutes to the axis SS. In consequence it must needs be, if\r\nour theory is true, that the surfaces which the section through NN\r\nproduces should effect the same refractions as the surfaces of the\r\nsection through GG. And not only the surfaces of the section NN but\r\nall other sections produced by planes which might be inclined to the\r\naxis at an angle equal to 45 degrees 20 minutes. So that there are an\r\ninfinitude of planes which ought to produce precisely the same\r\nrefractions as the natural surfaces of the crystal, or as the section\r\nparallel to any one of those surfaces which are made by cleavage.\r\n\r\nI saw also that by cutting it by a plane taken through PP, and\r\nperpendicular to the axis SS, the refraction of the surfaces ought to\r\nbe such that the perpendicular ray should suffer thereby no deviation;\r\nand that for oblique rays there would always be an irregular\r\nrefraction, differing from the regular, and by which objects placed\r\nbeneath the crystal would be less elevated than by that other\r\nrefraction.\r\n\r\nThat, similarly, by cutting the crystal by any plane through the axis\r\nSS, such as the plane of the figure is, the perpendicular ray ought to\r\nsuffer no refraction; and that for oblique rays there were different\r\nmeasures for the irregular refraction according to the situation of\r\nthe plane in which the incident ray was.\r\n\r\nNow these things were found in fact so; and, after that, I could not\r\ndoubt that a similar success could be met with everywhere. Whence I\r\nconcluded that one might form from this crystal solids similar to\r\nthose which are its natural forms, which should produce, at all their\r\nsurfaces, the same regular and irregular refractions as the natural\r\nsurfaces, and which nevertheless would cleave in quite other ways, and\r\nnot in directions parallel to any of their faces. That out of it one\r\nwould be able to fashion pyramids, having their base square,\r\npentagonal, hexagonal, or with as many sides as one desired, all the\r\nsurfaces of which should have the same refractions as the natural\r\nsurfaces of the crystal, except the base, which will not refract the\r\nperpendicular ray. These surfaces will each make an angle of 45\r\ndegrees 20 minutes with the axis of the crystal, and the base will be\r\nthe section perpendicular to the axis.\r\n\r\nThat, finally, one could also fashion out of it triangular prisms, or\r\nprisms with as many sides as one would, of which neither the sides nor\r\nthe bases would refract the perpendicular ray, although they would yet\r\nall cause double refraction for oblique rays. The cube is included\r\namongst these prisms, the bases of which are sections perpendicular to\r\nthe axis of the crystal, and the sides are sections parallel to the\r\nsame axis.\r\n\r\nFrom all this it further appears that it is not at all in the\r\ndisposition of the layers of which this crystal seems to be composed,\r\nand according to which it splits in three different senses, that the\r\ncause resides of its irregular refraction; and that it would be in\r\nvain to wish to seek it there.\r\n\r\nBut in order that any one who has some of this stone may be able to\r\nfind, by his own experience, the truth of what I have just advanced, I\r\nwill state here the process of which I have made use to cut it, and to\r\npolish it. Cutting is easy by the slicing wheels of lapidaries, or in\r\nthe way in which marble is sawn: but polishing is very difficult, and\r\nby employing the ordinary means one more often depolishes the surfaces\r\nthan makes them lucent.\r\n\r\nAfter many trials, I have at last found that for this service no plate\r\nof metal must be used, but a piece of mirror glass made matt and\r\ndepolished. Upon this, with fine sand and water, one smoothes the\r\ncrystal little by little, in the same way as spectacle glasses, and\r\npolishes it simply by continuing the work, but ever reducing the\r\nmaterial. I have not, however, been able to give it perfect clarity\r\nand transparency; but the evenness which the surfaces acquire enables\r\none to observe in them the effects of refraction better than in those\r\nmade by cleaving the stone, which always have some inequality.\r\n\r\nEven when the surface is only moderately smoothed, if one rubs it over\r\nwith a little oil or white of egg, it becomes quite transparent, so\r\nthat the refraction is discerned in it quite distinctly. And this aid\r\nis specially necessary when it is wished to polish the natural\r\nsurfaces to remove the inequalities; because one cannot render them\r\nlucent equally with the surfaces of other sections, which take a\r\npolish so much the better the less nearly they approximate to these\r\nnatural planes.\r\n\r\nBefore finishing the treatise on this Crystal, I will add one more\r\nmarvellous phenomenon which I discovered after having written all the\r\nforegoing. For though I have not been able till now to find its cause,\r\nI do not for that reason wish to desist from describing it, in order\r\nto give opportunity to others to investigate it. It seems that it will\r\nbe necessary to make still further suppositions besides those which I\r\nhave made; but these will not for all that cease to keep their\r\nprobability after having been confirmed by so many tests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon is, that by taking two pieces of this crystal and\r\napplying them one over the other, or rather holding them with a space\r\nbetween the two, if all the sides of one are parallel to those of the\r\nother, then a ray of light, such as AB, is divided into two in the\r\nfirst piece, namely into BD and BC, following the two refractions,\r\nregular and irregular. On penetrating thence into the other piece\r\neach ray will pass there without further dividing itself in two; but\r\nthat one which underwent the regular refraction, as here DG, will\r\nundergo again only a regular refraction at GH; and the other, CE, an\r\nirregular refraction at EF. And the same thing occurs not only in this\r\ndisposition, but also in all those cases in which the principal\r\nsection of each of the pieces is situated in one and the same plane,\r\nwithout it being needful for the two neighbouring surfaces to be\r\nparallel. Now it is marvellous why the rays CE and DG, incident from\r\nthe air on the lower crystal, do not divide themselves the same as the\r\nfirst ray AB. One would say that it must be that the ray DG in passing\r\nthrough the upper piece has lost something which is necessary to move\r\nthe matter which serves for the irregular refraction; and that\r\nlikewise CE has lost that which was necessary to move the matter\r\nwhich serves for regular refraction: but there is yet another thing\r\nwhich upsets this reasoning. It is that when one disposes the two\r\ncrystals in such a way that the planes which constitute the principal\r\nsections intersect one another at right angles, whether the\r\nneighbouring surfaces are parallel or not, then the ray which has come\r\nby the regular refraction, as DG, undergoes only an irregular\r\nrefraction in the lower piece; and on the contrary the ray which has\r\ncome by the irregular refraction, as CE, undergoes only a regular\r\nrefraction.\r\n\r\nBut in all the infinite other positions, besides those which I have\r\njust stated, the rays DG, CE, divide themselves anew each one into\r\ntwo, by refraction in the lower crystal so that from the single ray AB\r\nthere are four, sometimes of equal brightness, sometimes some much\r\nless bright than others, according to the varying agreement in the\r\npositions of the crystals: but they do not appear to have all together\r\nmore light than the single ray AB.\r\n\r\nWhen one considers here how, while the rays CE, DG, remain the same,\r\nit depends on the position that one gives to the lower piece, whether\r\nit divides them both in two, or whether it does not divide them, and\r\nyet how the ray AB above is always divided, it seems that one is\r\nobliged to conclude that the waves of light, after having passed\r\nthrough the first crystal, acquire a certain form or disposition in\r\nvirtue of which, when meeting the texture of the second crystal, in\r\ncertain positions, they can move the two different kinds of matter\r\nwhich serve for the two species of refraction; and when meeting the\r\nsecond crystal in another position are able to move only one of these\r\nkinds of matter. But to tell how this occurs, I have hitherto found\r\nnothing which satisfies me.\r\n\r\nLeaving then to others this research, I pass to what I have to say\r\ntouching the cause of the extraordinary figure of this crystal, and\r\nwhy it cleaves easily in three different senses, parallel to any one\r\nof its surfaces.\r\n\r\nThere are many bodies, vegetable, mineral, and congealed salts, which\r\nare formed with certain regular angles and figures. Thus among flowers\r\nthere are many which have their leaves disposed in ordered polygons,\r\nto the number of 3, 4, 5, or 6 sides, but not more. This well deserves\r\nto be investigated, both as to the polygonal figure, and as to why it\r\ndoes not exceed the number 6.\r\n\r\nRock Crystal grows ordinarily in hexagonal bars, and diamonds are\r\nfound which occur with a square point and polished surfaces. There is\r\na species of small flat stones, piled up directly upon one another,\r\nwhich are all of pentagonal figure with rounded angles, and the sides\r\na little folded inwards. The grains of gray salt which are formed from\r\nsea water affect the figure, or at least the angle, of the cube; and\r\nin the congelations of other salts, and in that of sugar, there are\r\nfound other solid angles with perfectly flat faces. Small snowflakes\r\nalmost always fall in little stars with 6 points, and sometimes in\r\nhexagons with straight sides. And I have often observed, in water\r\nwhich is beginning to freeze, a kind of flat and thin foliage of ice,\r\nthe middle ray of which throws out branches inclined at an angle of 60\r\ndegrees. All these things are worthy of being carefully investigated\r\nto ascertain how and by what artifice nature there operates. But it is\r\nnot now my intention to treat fully of this matter. It seems that in\r\ngeneral the regularity which occurs in these productions comes from\r\nthe arrangement of the small invisible equal particles of which they\r\nare composed. And, coming to our Iceland Crystal, I say that if there\r\nwere a pyramid such as ABCD, composed of small rounded corpuscles, not\r\nspherical but flattened spheroids, such as would be made by the\r\nrotation of the ellipse GH around its lesser diameter EF (of which the\r\nratio to the greater diameter is very nearly that of 1 to the square\r\nroot of 8)--I say that then the solid angle of the point D would be\r\nequal to the obtuse and equilateral angle of this Crystal. I say,\r\nfurther, that if these corpuscles were lightly stuck together, on\r\nbreaking this pyramid it would break along faces parallel to those\r\nthat make its point: and by this means, as it is easy to see, it would\r\nproduce prisms similar to those of the same crystal as this other\r\nfigure represents. The reason is that when broken in this fashion a\r\nwhole layer separates easily from its neighbouring layer since each\r\nspheroid has to be detached only from the three spheroids of the next\r\nlayer; of which three there is but one which touches it on its\r\nflattened surface, and the other two at the edges. And the reason why\r\nthe surfaces separate sharp and polished is that if any spheroid of\r\nthe neighbouring surface would come out by attaching itself to the\r\nsurface which is being separated, it would be needful for it to detach\r\nitself from six other spheroids which hold it locked, and four of\r\nwhich press it by these flattened surfaces. Since then not only the\r\nangles of our crystal but also the manner in which it splits agree\r\nprecisely with what is observed in the assemblage composed of such\r\nspheroids, there is great reason to believe that the particles are\r\nshaped and ranged in the same way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: {Pyramid and section of spheroids}]\r\n\r\nThere is even probability enough that the prisms of this crystal are\r\nproduced by the breaking up of pyramids, since Mr. Bartholinus relates\r\nthat he occasionally found some pieces of triangularly pyramidal\r\nfigure. But when a mass is composed interiorly only of these little\r\nspheroids thus piled up, whatever form it may have exteriorly, it is\r\ncertain, by the same reasoning which I have just explained, that if\r\nbroken it would produce similar prisms. It remains to be seen whether\r\nthere are other reasons which confirm our conjecture, and whether\r\nthere are none which are repugnant to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: {paralleloid arrangement of spheroids with planes of\r\npotential cleavage}]\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that this crystal, being so composed, might be\r\ncapable of cleavage in yet two more fashions; one of which would be\r\nalong planes parallel to the base of the pyramid, that is to say to\r\nthe triangle ABC; the other would be parallel to a plane the trace of\r\nwhich is marked by the lines GH, HK, KL. To which I say that both the\r\none and the other, though practicable, are more difficult than those\r\nwhich were parallel to any one of the three planes of the pyramid; and\r\nthat therefore, when striking on the crystal in order to break it, it\r\nought always to split rather along these three planes than along the\r\ntwo others. When one has a number of spheroids of the form above\r\ndescribed, and ranges them in a pyramid, one sees why the two methods\r\nof division are more difficult. For in the case of that division which\r\nwould be parallel to the base, each spheroid would be obliged to\r\ndetach itself from three others which it touches upon their flattened\r\nsurfaces, which hold more strongly than the contacts at the edges. And\r\nbesides that, this division will not occur along entire layers,\r\nbecause each of the spheroids of a layer is scarcely held at all by\r\nthe 6 of the same layer that surround it, since they only touch it at\r\nthe edges; so that it adheres readily to the neighbouring layer, and\r\nthe others to it, for the same reason; and this causes uneven\r\nsurfaces. Also one sees by experiment that when grinding down the\r\ncrystal on a rather rough stone, directly on the equilateral solid\r\nangle, one verily finds much facility in reducing it in this\r\ndirection, but much difficulty afterwards in polishing the surface\r\nwhich has been flattened in this manner.\r\n\r\nAs for the other method of division along the plane GHKL, it will be\r\nseen that each spheroid would have to detach itself from four of the\r\nneighbouring layer, two of which touch it on the flattened surfaces,\r\nand two at the edges. So that this division is likewise more difficult\r\nthan that which is made parallel to one of the surfaces of the\r\ncrystal; where, as we have said, each spheroid is detached from only\r\nthree of the neighbouring layer: of which three there is one only\r\nwhich touches it on the flattened surface, and the other two at the\r\nedges only.\r\n\r\nHowever, that which has made me know that in the crystal there are\r\nlayers in this last fashion, is that in a piece weighing half a pound\r\nwhich I possess, one sees that it is split along its length, as is the\r\nabove-mentioned prism by the plane GHKL; as appears by colours of the\r\nIris extending throughout this whole plane although the two pieces\r\nstill hold together. All this proves then that the composition of the\r\ncrystal is such as we have stated. To which I again add this\r\nexperiment; that if one passes a knife scraping along any one of the\r\nnatural surfaces, and downwards as it were from the equilateral obtuse\r\nangle, that is to say from the apex of the pyramid, one finds it quite\r\nhard; but by scraping in the opposite sense an incision is easily\r\nmade. This follows manifestly from the situation of the small\r\nspheroids; over which, in the first manner, the knife glides; but in\r\nthe other manner it seizes them from beneath almost as if they were\r\nthe scales of a fish.\r\n\r\nI will not undertake to say anything touching the way in which so many\r\ncorpuscles all equal and similar are generated, nor how they are set\r\nin such beautiful order; whether they are formed first and then\r\nassembled, or whether they arrange themselves thus in coming into\r\nbeing and as fast as they are produced, which seems to me more\r\nprobable. To develop truths so recondite there would be needed a\r\nknowledge of nature much greater than that which we have. I will add\r\nonly that these little spheroids could well contribute to form the\r\nspheroids of the waves of light, here above supposed, these as well as\r\nthose being similarly situated, and with their axes parallel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calculations which have been supposed in this Chapter_.\r\n\r\nMr. Bartholinus, in his treatise of this Crystal, puts at 101 degrees\r\nthe obtuse angles of the faces, which I have stated to be 101 degrees\r\n52 minutes. He states that he measured these angles directly on the\r\ncrystal, which is difficult to do with ultimate exactitude, because\r\nthe edges such as CA, CB, in this figure, are generally worn, and not\r\nquite straight. For more certainty, therefore, I preferred to measure\r\nactually the obtuse angle by which the faces CBDA, CBVF, are inclined\r\nto one another, namely the angle OCN formed by drawing CN\r\nperpendicular to FV, and CO perpendicular to DA. This angle OCN I\r\nfound to be 105 degrees; and its supplement CNP, to be 75 degrees, as\r\nit should be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo find from this the obtuse angle BCA, I imagined a sphere having its\r\ncentre at C, and on its surface a spherical triangle, formed by the\r\nintersection of three planes which enclose the solid angle C. In this\r\nequilateral triangle, which is ABF in this other figure, I see that\r\neach of the angles should be 105 degrees, namely equal to the angle\r\nOCN; and that each of the sides should be of as many degrees as the\r\nangle ACB, or ACF, or BCF. Having then drawn the arc FQ perpendicular\r\nto the side AB, which it divides equally at Q, the triangle FQA has a\r\nright angle at Q, the angle A 105 degrees, and F half as much, namely\r\n52 degrees 30 minutes; whence the hypotenuse AF is found to be 101\r\ndegrees 52 minutes. And this arc AF is the measure of the angle ACF in\r\nthe figure of the crystal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the same figure, if the plane CGHF cuts the crystal so that it\r\ndivides the obtuse angles ACB, MHV, in the middle, it is stated, in\r\nArticle 10, that the angle CFH is 70 degrees 57 minutes. This again is\r\neasily shown in the same spherical triangle ABF, in which it appears\r\nthat the arc FQ is as many degrees as the angle GCF in the crystal,\r\nthe supplement of which is the angle CFH. Now the arc FQ is found to\r\nbe 109 degrees 3 minutes. Then its supplement, 70 degrees 57 minutes,\r\nis the angle CFH.\r\n\r\nIt was stated, in Article 26, that the straight line CS, which in the\r\npreceding figure is CH, being the axis of the crystal, that is to say\r\nbeing equally inclined to the three sides CA, CB, CF, the angle GCH is\r\n45 degrees 20 minutes. This is also easily calculated by the same\r\nspherical triangle. For by drawing the other arc AD which cuts BF\r\nequally, and intersects FQ at S, this point will be the centre of the\r\ntriangle. And it is easy to see that the arc SQ is the measure of the\r\nangle GCH in the figure which represents the crystal. Now in the\r\ntriangle QAS, which is right-angled, one knows also the angle A, which\r\nis 52 degrees 30 minutes, and the side AQ 50 degrees 56 minutes;\r\nwhence the side SQ is found to be 45 degrees 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nIn Article 27 it was required to show that PMS being an ellipse the\r\ncentre of which is C, and which touches the straight line MD at M so\r\nthat the angle MCL which CM makes with CL, perpendicular on DM, is 6\r\ndegrees 40 minutes, and its semi-minor axis CS making with CG (which\r\nis parallel to MD) an angle GCS of 45 degrees 20 minutes, it was\r\nrequired to show, I say, that, CM being 100,000 parts, PC the\r\nsemi-major diameter of this ellipse is 105,032 parts, and CS, the\r\nsemi-minor diameter, 93,410.\r\n\r\nLet CP and CS be prolonged and meet the tangent DM at D and Z; and\r\nfrom the point of contact M let MN and MO be drawn as perpendiculars\r\nto CP and CS. Now because the angles SCP, GCL, are right angles, the\r\nangle PCL will be equal to GCS which was 45 degrees 20 minutes. And\r\ndeducting the angle LCM, which is 6 degrees 40 minutes, from LCP,\r\nwhich is 45 degrees 20 minutes, there remains MCP, 38 degrees 40\r\nminutes. Considering then CM as a radius of 100,000 parts, MN, the\r\nsine of 38 degrees 40 minutes, will be 62,479. And in the right-angled\r\ntriangle MND, MN will be to ND as the radius of the Tables is to the\r\ntangent of 45 degrees 20 minutes (because the angle NMD is equal to\r\nDCL, or GCS); that is to say as 100,000 to 101,170: whence results ND\r\n63,210. But NC is 78,079 of the same parts, CM being 100,000, because\r\nNC is the sine of the complement of the angle MCP, which was 38\r\ndegrees 40 minutes. Then the whole line DC is 141,289; and CP, which\r\nis a mean proportional between DC and CN, since MD touches the\r\nEllipse, will be 105,032.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSimilarly, because the angle OMZ is equal to CDZ, or LCZ, which is 44\r\ndegrees 40 minutes, being the complement of GCS, it follows that, as\r\nthe radius of the Tables is to the tangent of 44 degrees 40 minutes,\r\nso will OM 78,079 be to OZ 77,176. But OC is 62,479 of these same\r\nparts of which CM is 100,000, because it is equal to MN, the sine of\r\nthe angle MCP, which is 38 degrees 40 minutes. Then the whole line CZ\r\nis 139,655; and CS, which is a mean proportional between CZ and CO\r\nwill be 93,410.\r\n\r\nAt the same place it was stated that GC was found to be 98,779 parts.\r\nTo prove this, let PE be drawn in the same figure parallel to DM, and\r\nmeeting CM at E. In the right-angled triangle CLD the side CL is\r\n99,324 (CM being 100,000), because CL is the sine of the complement of\r\nthe angle LCM, which is 6 degrees 40 minutes. And since the angle LCD\r\nis 45 degrees 20 minutes, being equal to GCS, the side LD is found to\r\nbe 100,486: whence deducting ML 11,609 there will remain MD 88,877.\r\nNow as CD (which was 141,289) is to DM 88,877, so will CP 105,032 be\r\nto PE 66,070. But as the rectangle MEH (or rather the difference of\r\nthe squares on CM and CE) is to the square on MC, so is the square on\r\nPE to the square on C_g_; then also as the difference of the squares\r\non DC and CP to the square on CD, so also is the square on PE to the\r\nsquare on _g_C. But DP, CP, and PE are known; hence also one knows GC,\r\nwhich is 98,779.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lemma which has been supposed_.\r\n\r\nIf a spheroid is touched by a straight line, and also by two or more\r\nplanes which are parallel to this line, though not parallel to one\r\nanother, all the points of contact of the line, as well as of the\r\nplanes, will be in one and the same ellipse made by a plane which\r\npasses through the centre of the spheroid.\r\n\r\nLet LED be the spheroid touched by the line BM at the point B, and\r\nalso by the planes parallel to this line at the points O and A. It is\r\nrequired to demonstrate that the points B, O, and A are in one and the\r\nsame Ellipse made in the spheroid by a plane which passes through its\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThrough the line BM, and through the points O and A, let there be\r\ndrawn planes parallel to one another, which, in cutting the spheroid\r\nmake the ellipses LBD, POP, QAQ; which will all be similar and\r\nsimilarly disposed, and will have their centres K, N, R, in one and\r\nthe same diameter of the spheroid, which will also be the diameter of\r\nthe ellipse made by the section of the plane that passes through the\r\ncentre of the spheroid, and which cuts the planes of the three said\r\nEllipses at right angles: for all this is manifest by proposition 15\r\nof the book of Conoids and Spheroids of Archimedes. Further, the two\r\nlatter planes, which are drawn through the points O and A, will also,\r\nby cutting the planes which touch the spheroid in these same points,\r\ngenerate straight lines, as OH and AS, which will, as is easy to see,\r\nbe parallel to BM; and all three, BM, OH, AS, will touch the Ellipses\r\nLBD, POP, QAQ in these points, B, O, A; since they are in the planes\r\nof these ellipses, and at the same time in the planes which touch the\r\nspheroid. If now from these points B, O, A, there are drawn the\r\nstraight lines BK, ON, AR, through the centres of the same ellipses,\r\nand if through these centres there are drawn also the diameters LD,\r\nPP, QQ, parallel to the tangents BM, OH, AS; these will be conjugate\r\nto the aforesaid BK, ON, AR. And because the three ellipses are\r\nsimilar and similarly disposed, and have their diameters LD, PP, QQ\r\nparallel, it is certain that their conjugate diameters BK, ON, AR,\r\nwill also be parallel. And the centres K, N, R being, as has been\r\nstated, in one and the same diameter of the spheroid, these parallels\r\nBK, ON, AR will necessarily be in one and the same plane, which passes\r\nthrough this diameter of the spheroid, and, in consequence, the points\r\nR, O, A are in one and the same ellipse made by the intersection of\r\nthis plane. Which was to be proved. And it is manifest that the\r\ndemonstration would be the same if, besides the points O, A, there had\r\nbeen others in which the spheroid had been touched by planes parallel\r\nto the straight line BM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nON THE FIGURES OF THE TRANSPARENT BODIES\r\n\r\nWhich serve for Refraction and for Reflexion\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having explained how the properties of reflexion and refraction\r\nfollow from what we have supposed concerning the nature of light, and\r\nof opaque bodies, and of transparent media, I will here set forth a\r\nvery easy and natural way of deducing, from the same principles, the\r\ntrue figures which serve, either by reflexion or by refraction, to\r\ncollect or disperse the rays of light, as may be desired. For though I\r\ndo not see yet that there are means of making use of these figures, so\r\nfar as relates to Refraction, not only because of the difficulty of\r\nshaping the glasses of Telescopes with the requisite exactitude\r\naccording to these figures, but also because there exists in\r\nrefraction itself a property which hinders the perfect concurrence of\r\nthe rays, as Mr. Newton has very well proved by experiment, I will yet\r\nnot desist from relating the invention, since it offers itself, so to\r\nspeak, of itself, and because it further confirms our Theory of\r\nrefraction, by the agreement which here is found between the refracted\r\nray and the reflected ray. Besides, it may occur that some one in the\r\nfuture will discover in it utilities which at present are not seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo proceed then to these figures, let us suppose first that it is\r\ndesired to find a surface CDE which shall reassemble at a point B rays\r\ncoming from another point A; and that the summit of the surface shall\r\nbe the given point D in the straight line AB. I say that, whether by\r\nreflexion or by refraction, it is only necessary to make this surface\r\nsuch that the path of the light from the point A to all points of the\r\ncurved line CDE, and from these to the point of concurrence (as here\r\nthe path along the straight lines AC, CB, along AL, LB, and along AD,\r\nDB), shall be everywhere traversed in equal times: by which principle\r\nthe finding of these curves becomes very easy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo far as relates to the reflecting surface, since the sum of the\r\nlines AC, CB ought to be equal to that of AD, DB, it appears that DCE\r\nought to be an ellipse; and for refraction, the ratio of the\r\nvelocities of waves of light in the media A and B being supposed to be\r\nknown, for example that of 3 to 2 (which is the same, as we have\r\nshown, as the ratio of the Sines in the refraction), it is only\r\nnecessary to make DH equal to 3/2 of DB; and having after that\r\ndescribed from the centre A some arc FC, cutting DB at F, then\r\ndescribe another from centre B with its semi-diameter BX equal to 2/3\r\nof FH; and the point of intersection of the two arcs will be one of\r\nthe points required, through which the curve should pass. For this\r\npoint, having been found in this fashion, it is easy forthwith to\r\ndemonstrate that the time along AC, CB, will be equal to the time\r\nalong AD, DB.\r\n\r\nFor assuming that the line AD represents the time which the light\r\ntakes to traverse this same distance AD in air, it is evident that DH,\r\nequal to 3/2 of DB, will represent the time of the light along DB in\r\nthe medium, because it needs here more time in proportion as its speed\r\nis slower. Therefore the whole line AH will represent the time along\r\nAD, DB. Similarly the line AC or AF will represent the time along AC;\r\nand FH being by construction equal to 3/2 of CB, it will represent the\r\ntime along CB in the medium; and in consequence the whole line AH will\r\nrepresent also the time along AC, CB. Whence it appears that the time\r\nalong AC, CB, is equal to the time along AD, DB. And similarly it can\r\nbe shown if L and K are other points in the curve CDE, that the times\r\nalong AL, LB, and along AK, KB, are always represented by the line AH,\r\nand therefore equal to the said time along AD, DB.\r\n\r\nIn order to show further that the surfaces, which these curves will\r\ngenerate by revolution, will direct all the rays which reach them from\r\nthe point A in such wise that they tend towards B, let there be\r\nsupposed a point K in the curve, farther from D than C is, but such\r\nthat the straight line AK falls from outside upon the curve which\r\nserves for the refraction; and from the centre B let the arc KS be\r\ndescribed, cutting BD at S, and the straight line CB at R; and from\r\nthe centre A describe the arc DN meeting AK at N.\r\n\r\nSince the sums of the times along AK, KB, and along AC, CB are equal,\r\nif from the former sum one deducts the time along KB, and if from the\r\nother one deducts the time along RB, there will remain the time along\r\nAK as equal to the time along the two parts AC, CR. Consequently in\r\nthe time that the light has come along AK it will also have come along\r\nAC and will in addition have made, in the medium from the centre C, a\r\npartial spherical wave, having a semi-diameter equal to CR. And this\r\nwave will necessarily touch the circumference KS at R, since CB cuts\r\nthis circumference at right angles. Similarly, having taken any other\r\npoint L in the curve, one can show that in the same time as the light\r\npasses along AL it will also have come along AL and in addition will\r\nhave made a partial wave, from the centre L, which will touch the same\r\ncircumference KS. And so with all other points of the curve CDE. Then\r\nat the moment that the light reaches K the arc KRS will be the\r\ntermination of the movement, which has spread from A through DCK. And\r\nthus this same arc will constitute in the medium the propagation of\r\nthe wave emanating from A; which wave may be represented by the arc\r\nDN, or by any other nearer the centre A. But all the pieces of the arc\r\nKRS are propagated successively along straight lines which are\r\nperpendicular to them, that is to say, which tend to the centre B (for\r\nthat can be demonstrated in the same way as we have proved above that\r\nthe pieces of spherical waves are propagated along the straight lines\r\ncoming from their centre), and these progressions of the pieces of the\r\nwaves constitute the rays themselves of light. It appears then that\r\nall these rays tend here towards the point B.\r\n\r\nOne might also determine the point C, and all the others, in this\r\ncurve which serves for the refraction, by dividing DA at G in such a\r\nway that DG is 2/3 of DA, and describing from the centre B any arc CX\r\nwhich cuts BD at N, and another from the centre A with its\r\nsemi-diameter AF equal to 3/2 of GX; or rather, having described, as\r\nbefore, the arc CX, it is only necessary to make DF equal to 3/2 of\r\nDX, and from-the centre A to strike the arc FC; for these two\r\nconstructions, as may be easily known, come back to the first one\r\nwhich was shown before. And it is manifest by the last method that\r\nthis curve is the same that Mr. Des Cartes has given in his Geometry,\r\nand which he calls the first of his Ovals.\r\n\r\nIt is only a part of this oval which serves for the refraction,\r\nnamely, the part DK, ending at K, if AK is the tangent. As to the,\r\nother part, Des Cartes has remarked that it could serve for\r\nreflexions, if there were some material of a mirror of such a nature\r\nthat by its means the force of the rays (or, as we should say, the\r\nvelocity of the light, which he could not say, since he held that the\r\nmovement of light was instantaneous) could be augmented in the\r\nproportion of 3 to 2. But we have shown that in our way of explaining\r\nreflexion, such a thing could not arise from the matter of the mirror,\r\nand it is entirely impossible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrom what has been demonstrated about this oval, it will be easy to\r\nfind the figure which serves to collect to a point incident parallel\r\nrays. For by supposing just the same construction, but the point A\r\ninfinitely distant, giving parallel rays, our oval becomes a true\r\nEllipse, the construction of which differs in no way from that of the\r\noval, except that FC, which previously was an arc of a circle, is here\r\na straight line, perpendicular to DB. For the wave of light DN, being\r\nlikewise represented by a straight line, it will be seen that all the\r\npoints of this wave, travelling as far as the surface KD along lines\r\nparallel to DB, will advance subsequently towards the point B, and\r\nwill arrive there at the same time. As for the Ellipse which served\r\nfor reflexion, it is evident that it will here become a parabola,\r\nsince its focus A may be regarded as infinitely distant from the\r\nother, B, which is here the focus of the parabola, towards which all\r\nthe reflexions of rays parallel to AB tend. And the demonstration of\r\nthese effects is just the same as the preceding.\r\n\r\nBut that this curved line CDE which serves for refraction is an\r\nEllipse, and is such that its major diameter is to the distance\r\nbetween its foci as 3 to 2, which is the proportion of the refraction,\r\ncan be easily found by the calculus of Algebra. For DB, which is\r\ngiven, being called _a_; its undetermined perpendicular DT being\r\ncalled _x_; and TC _y_; FB will be _a - y_; CB will be sqrt(_xx + aa\r\n-2ay + yy_). But the nature of the curve is such that 2/3 of TC\r\ntogether with CB is equal to DB, as was stated in the last\r\nconstruction: then the equation will be between _(2/3)y + sqrt(xx + aa\r\n- 2ay + yy)_ and _a_; which being reduced, gives _(6/5)ay - yy_ equal\r\nto _(9/5)xx_; that is to say that having made DO equal to 6/5 of DB,\r\nthe rectangle DFO is equal to 9/5 of the square on FC. Whence it is\r\nseen that DC is an ellipse, of which the axis DO is to the parameter\r\nas 9 to 5; and therefore the square on DO is to the square of the\r\ndistance between the foci as 9 to 9 - 5, that is to say 4; and finally\r\nthe line DO will be to this distance as 3 to 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAgain, if one supposes the point B to be infinitely distant, in lieu\r\nof our first oval we shall find that CDE is a true Hyperbola; which\r\nwill make those rays become parallel which come from the point A. And\r\nin consequence also those which are parallel within the transparent\r\nbody will be collected outside at the point A. Now it must be remarked\r\nthat CX and KS become straight lines perpendicular to BA, because they\r\nrepresent arcs of circles the centre of which is infinitely distant.\r\nAnd the intersection of the perpendicular CX with the arc FC will give\r\nthe point C, one of those through which the curve ought to pass. And\r\nthis operates so that all the parts of the wave of light DN, coming to\r\nmeet the surface KDE, will advance thence along parallels to KS and\r\nwill arrive at this straight line at the same time; of which the proof\r\nis again the same as that which served for the first oval. Besides one\r\nfinds by a calculation as easy as the preceding one, that CDE is here\r\na hyperbola of which the axis DO is 4/5 of AD, and the parameter\r\nequal to AD. Whence it is easily proved that DO is to the distance\r\nbetween the foci as 3 to 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese are the two cases in which Conic sections serve for refraction,\r\nand are the same which are explained, in his _Dioptrique_, by Des\r\nCartes, who first found out the use of these lines in relation to\r\nrefraction, as also that of the Ovals the first of which we have\r\nalready set forth. The second oval is that which serves for rays that\r\ntend to a given point; in which oval, if the apex of the surface which\r\nreceives the rays is D, it will happen that the other apex will be\r\nsituated between B and A, or beyond A, according as the ratio of AD to\r\nDB is given of greater or lesser value. And in this latter case it is\r\nthe same as that which Des Cartes calls his 3rd oval.\r\n\r\nNow the finding and construction of this second oval is the same as\r\nthat of the first, and the demonstration of its effect likewise. But\r\nit is worthy of remark that in one case this oval becomes a perfect\r\ncircle, namely when the ratio of AD to DB is the same as the ratio of\r\nthe refractions, here as 3 to 2, as I observed a long time ago. The\r\n4th oval, serving only for impossible reflexions, there is no need to\r\nset it forth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs for the manner in which Mr. Des Cartes discovered these lines,\r\nsince he has given no explanation of it, nor any one else since that I\r\nknow of, I will say here, in passing, what it seems to me it must have\r\nbeen. Let it be proposed to find the surface generated by the\r\nrevolution of the curve KDE, which, receiving the incident rays coming\r\nto it from the point A, shall deviate them toward the point B. Then\r\nconsidering this other curve as already known, and that its apex D is\r\nin the straight line AB, let us divide it up into an infinitude of\r\nsmall pieces by the points G, C, F; and having drawn from each of\r\nthese points, straight lines towards A to represent the incident rays,\r\nand other straight lines towards B, let there also be described with\r\ncentre A the arcs GL, CM, FN, DO, cutting the rays that come from A at\r\nL, M, N, O; and from the points K, G, C, F, let there be described\r\nthe arcs KQ, GR, CS, FT cutting the rays towards B at Q, R, S, T; and\r\nlet us suppose that the straight line HKZ cuts the curve at K at\r\nright-angles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen AK being an incident ray, and KB its refraction within the\r\nmedium, it needs must be, according to the law of refraction which was\r\nknown to Mr. Des Cartes, that the sine of the angle ZKA should be to\r\nthe sine of the angle HKB as 3 to 2, supposing that this is the\r\nproportion of the refraction of glass; or rather, that the sine of the\r\nangle KGL should have this same ratio to the sine of the angle GKQ,\r\nconsidering KG, GL, KQ as straight lines because of their smallness.\r\nBut these sines are the lines KL and GQ, if GK is taken as the radius\r\nof the circle. Then LK ought to be to GQ as 3 to 2; and in the same\r\nratio MG to CR, NC to FS, OF to DT. Then also the sum of all the\r\nantecedents to all the consequents would be as 3 to 2. Now by\r\nprolonging the arc DO until it meets AK at X, KX is the sum of the\r\nantecedents. And by prolonging the arc KQ till it meets AD at Y, the\r\nsum of the consequents is DY. Then KX ought to be to DY as 3 to 2.\r\nWhence it would appear that the curve KDE was of such a nature that\r\nhaving drawn from some point which had been assumed, such as K, the\r\nstraight lines KA, KB, the excess by which AK surpasses AD should be\r\nto the excess of DB over KB, as 3 to 2. For it can similarly be\r\ndemonstrated, by taking any other point in the curve, such as G, that\r\nthe excess of AG over AD, namely VG, is to the excess of BD over DG,\r\nnamely DP, in this same ratio of 3 to 2. And following this principle\r\nMr. Des Cartes constructed these curves in his _Geometric_; and he\r\neasily recognized that in the case of parallel rays, these curves\r\nbecame Hyperbolas and Ellipses.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to our method and let us see how it leads without\r\ndifficulty to the finding of the curves which one side of the glass\r\nrequires when the other side is of a given figure; a figure not only\r\nplane or spherical, or made by one of the conic sections (which is the\r\nrestriction with which Des Cartes proposed this problem, leaving the\r\nsolution to those who should come after him) but generally any figure\r\nwhatever: that is to say, one made by the revolution of any given\r\ncurved line to which one must merely know how to draw straight lines\r\nas tangents.\r\n\r\nLet the given figure be that made by the revolution of some curve such\r\nas AK about the axis AV, and that this side of the glass receives rays\r\ncoming from the point L. Furthermore, let the thickness AB of the\r\nmiddle of the glass be given, and the point F at which one desires the\r\nrays to be all perfectly reunited, whatever be the first refraction\r\noccurring at the surface AK.\r\n\r\nI say that for this the sole requirement is that the outline BDK which\r\nconstitutes the other surface shall be such that the path of the\r\nlight from the point L to the surface AK, and from thence to the\r\nsurface BDK, and from thence to the point F, shall be traversed\r\neverywhere in equal times, and in each case in a time equal to that\r\nwhich the light employs, to pass along the straight line LF of which\r\nthe part AB is within the glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet LG be a ray falling on the arc AK. Its refraction GV will be given\r\nby means of the tangent which will be drawn at the point G. Now in GV\r\nthe point D must be found such that FD together with 3/2 of DG and the\r\nstraight line GL, may be equal to FB together with 3/2 of BA and the\r\nstraight line AL; which, as is clear, make up a given length. Or\r\nrather, by deducting from each the length of LG, which is also given,\r\nit will merely be needful to adjust FD up to the straight line VG in\r\nsuch a way that FD together with 3/2 of DG is equal to a given\r\nstraight line, which is a quite easy plane problem: and the point D\r\nwill be one of those through which the curve BDK ought to pass. And\r\nsimilarly, having drawn another ray LM, and found its refraction MO,\r\nthe point N will be found in this line, and so on as many times as one\r\ndesires.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the effect of the curve, let there be described about\r\nthe centre L the circular arc AH, cutting LG at H; and about the\r\ncentre F the arc BP; and in AB let AS be taken equal to 2/3 of HG; and\r\nSE equal to GD. Then considering AH as a wave of light emanating from\r\nthe point L, it is certain that during the time in which its piece H\r\narrives at G the piece A will have advanced within the transparent\r\nbody only along AS; for I suppose, as above, the proportion of the\r\nrefraction to be as 3 to 2. Now we know that the piece of wave which\r\nis incident on G, advances thence along the line GD, since GV is the\r\nrefraction of the ray LG. Then during the time that this piece of wave\r\nhas taken from G to D, the other piece which was at S has reached E,\r\nsince GD, SE are equal. But while the latter will advance from E to B,\r\nthe piece of wave which was at D will have spread into the air its\r\npartial wave, the semi-diameter of which, DC (supposing this wave to\r\ncut the line DF at C), will be 3/2 of EB, since the velocity of light\r\noutside the medium is to that inside as 3 to 2. Now it is easy to show\r\nthat this wave will touch the arc BP at this point C. For since, by\r\nconstruction, FD + 3/2 DG + GL are equal to FB + 3/2 BA + AL; on\r\ndeducting the equals LH, LA, there will remain FD + 3/2 DG + GH equal\r\nto FB + 3/2 BA. And, again, deducting from one side GH, and from the\r\nother side 3/2 of AS, which are equal, there will remain FD with 3/2\r\nDG equal to FB with 3/2 of BS. But 3/2 of DG are equal to 3/2 of ES;\r\nthen FD is equal to FB with 3/2 of BE. But DC was equal to 3/2 of EB;\r\nthen deducting these equal lengths from one side and from the other,\r\nthere will remain CF equal to FB. And thus it appears that the wave,\r\nthe semi-diameter of which is DC, touches the arc BP at the moment\r\nwhen the light coming from the point L has arrived at B along the line\r\nLB. It can be demonstrated similarly that at this same moment the\r\nlight that has come along any other ray, such as LM, MN, will have\r\npropagated the movement which is terminated at the arc BP. Whence it\r\nfollows, as has been often said, that the propagation of the wave AH,\r\nafter it has passed through the thickness of the glass, will be the\r\nspherical wave BP, all the pieces of which ought to advance along\r\nstraight lines, which are the rays of light, to the centre F. Which\r\nwas to be proved. Similarly these curved lines can be found in all the\r\ncases which can be proposed, as will be sufficiently shown by one or\r\ntwo examples which I will add.\r\n\r\nLet there be given the surface of the glass AK, made by the revolution\r\nabout the axis BA of the line AK, which may be straight or curved. Let\r\nthere be also given in the axis the point L and the thickness BA of\r\nthe glass; and let it be required to find the other surface KDB, which\r\nreceiving rays that are parallel to AB will direct them in such wise\r\nthat after being again refracted at the given surface AK they will all\r\nbe reassembled at the point L.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrom the point L let there be drawn to some point of the given line\r\nAK the straight line LG, which, being considered as a ray of light,\r\nits refraction GD will then be found. And this line being then\r\nprolonged at one side or the other will meet the straight line BL, as\r\nhere at V. Let there then be erected on AB the perpendicular BC, which\r\nwill represent a wave of light coming from the infinitely distant\r\npoint F, since we have supposed the rays to be parallel. Then all the\r\nparts of this wave BC must arrive at the same time at the point L; or\r\nrather all the parts of a wave emanating from the point L must arrive\r\nat the same time at the straight line BC. And for that, it is\r\nnecessary to find in the line VGD the point D such that having drawn\r\nDC parallel to AB, the sum of CD, plus 3/2 of DG, plus GL may be equal\r\nto 3/2 of AB, plus AL: or rather, on deducting from both sides GL,\r\nwhich is given, CD plus 3/2 of DG must be equal to a given length;\r\nwhich is a still easier problem than the preceding construction. The\r\npoint D thus found will be one of those through which the curve ought\r\nto pass; and the proof will be the same as before. And by this it will\r\nbe proved that the waves which come from the point L, after having\r\npassed through the glass KAKB, will take the form of straight lines,\r\nas BC; which is the same thing as saying that the rays will become\r\nparallel. Whence it follows reciprocally that parallel rays falling on\r\nthe surface KDB will be reassembled at the point L.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAgain, let there be given the surface AK, of any desired form,\r\ngenerated by revolution about the axis AB, and let the thickness of\r\nthe glass at the middle be AB. Also let the point L be given in the\r\naxis behind the glass; and let it be supposed that the rays which fall\r\non the surface AK tend to this point, and that it is required to find\r\nthe surface BD, which on their emergence from the glass turns them as\r\nif they came from the point F in front of the glass.\r\n\r\nHaving taken any point G in the line AK, and drawing the straight line\r\nIGL, its part GI will represent one of the incident rays, the\r\nrefraction of which, GV, will then be found: and it is in this line\r\nthat we must find the point D, one of those through which the curve DG\r\nought to pass. Let us suppose that it has been found: and about L as\r\ncentre let there be described GT, the arc of a circle cutting the\r\nstraight line AB at T, in case the distance LG is greater than LA; for\r\notherwise the arc AH must be described about the same centre, cutting\r\nthe straight line LG at H. This arc GT (or AH, in the other case) will\r\nrepresent an incident wave of light, the rays of which tend towards\r\nL. Similarly, about the centre F let there be described the circular\r\narc DQ, which will represent a wave emanating from the point F.\r\n\r\nThen the wave TG, after having passed through the glass, must form the\r\nwave QD; and for this I observe that the time taken by the light along\r\nGD in the glass must be equal to that taken along the three, TA, AB,\r\nand BQ, of which AB alone is within the glass. Or rather, having taken\r\nAS equal to 2/3 of AT, I observe that 3/2 of GD ought to be equal to\r\n3/2 of SB, plus BQ; and, deducting both of them from FD or FQ, that FD\r\nless 3/2 of GD ought to be equal to FB less 3/2 of SB. And this last\r\ndifference is a given length: and all that is required is to draw the\r\nstraight line FD from the given point F to meet VG so that it may be\r\nthus. Which is a problem quite similar to that which served for the\r\nfirst of these constructions, where FD plus 3/2 of GD had to be equal\r\nto a given length.\r\n\r\nIn the demonstration it is to be observed that, since the arc BC falls\r\nwithin the glass, there must be conceived an arc RX, concentric with\r\nit and on the other side of QD. Then after it shall have been shown\r\nthat the piece G of the wave GT arrives at D at the same time that the\r\npiece T arrives at Q, which is easily deduced from the construction,\r\nit will be evident as a consequence that the partial wave generated at\r\nthe point D will touch the arc RX at the moment when the piece Q shall\r\nhave come to R, and that thus this arc will at the same moment be the\r\ntermination of the movement that comes from the wave TG; whence all\r\nthe rest may be concluded.\r\n\r\nHaving shown the method of finding these curved lines which serve for\r\nthe perfect concurrence of the rays, there remains to be explained a\r\nnotable thing touching the uncoordinated refraction of spherical,\r\nplane, and other surfaces: an effect which if ignored might cause some\r\ndoubt concerning what we have several times said, that rays of light\r\nare straight lines which intersect at right angles the waves which\r\ntravel along them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor in the case of rays which, for example, fall parallel upon a\r\nspherical surface AFE, intersecting one another, after refraction, at\r\ndifferent points, as this figure represents; what can the waves of\r\nlight be, in this transparent body, which are cut at right angles by\r\nthe converging rays? For they can not be spherical. And what will\r\nthese waves become after the said rays begin to intersect one another?\r\nIt will be seen in the solution of this difficulty that something very\r\nremarkable comes to pass herein, and that the waves do not cease to\r\npersist though they do not continue entire, as when they cross the\r\nglasses designed according to the construction we have seen.\r\n\r\nAccording to what has been shown above, the straight line AD, which\r\nhas been drawn at the summit of the sphere, at right angles to the\r\naxis parallel to which the rays come, represents the wave of light;\r\nand in the time taken by its piece D to reach the spherical surface\r\nAGE at E, its other parts will have met the same surface at F, G, H,\r\netc., and will have also formed spherical partial waves of which these\r\npoints are the centres. And the surface EK which all those waves will\r\ntouch, will be the continuation of the wave AD in the sphere at the\r\nmoment when the piece D has reached E. Now the line EK is not an arc\r\nof a circle, but is a curved line formed as the evolute of another\r\ncurve ENC, which touches all the rays HL, GM, FO, etc., that are the\r\nrefractions of the parallel rays, if we imagine laid over the\r\nconvexity ENC a thread which in unwinding describes at its end E the\r\nsaid curve EK. For, supposing that this curve has been thus described,\r\nwe will show that the said waves formed from the centres F, G, H,\r\netc., will all touch it.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the curve EK and all the others described by the\r\nevolution of the curve ENC, with different lengths of thread, will cut\r\nall the rays HL, GM, FO, etc., at right angles, and in such wise that\r\nthe parts of them intercepted between two such curves will all be\r\nequal; for this follows from what has been demonstrated in our\r\ntreatise _de Motu Pendulorum_. Now imagining the incident rays as\r\nbeing infinitely near to one another, if we consider two of them, as\r\nRG, TF, and draw GQ perpendicular to RG, and if we suppose the curve\r\nFS which intersects GM at P to have been described by evolution from\r\nthe curve NC, beginning at F, as far as which the thread is supposed\r\nto extend, we may assume the small piece FP as a straight line\r\nperpendicular to the ray GM, and similarly the arc GF as a straight\r\nline. But GM being the refraction of the ray RG, and FP being\r\nperpendicular to it, QF must be to GP as 3 to 2, that is to say in the\r\nproportion of the refraction; as was shown above in explaining the\r\ndiscovery of Des Cartes. And the same thing occurs in all the small\r\narcs GH, HA, etc., namely that in the quadrilaterals which enclose\r\nthem the side parallel to the axis is to the opposite side as 3 to 2.\r\nThen also as 3 to 2 will the sum of the one set be to the sum of the\r\nother; that is to say, TF to AS, and DE to AK, and BE to SK or DV,\r\nsupposing V to be the intersection of the curve EK and the ray FO.\r\nBut, making FB perpendicular to DE, the ratio of 3 to 2 is also that\r\nof BE to the semi-diameter of the spherical wave which emanated from\r\nthe point F while the light outside the transparent body traversed the\r\nspace BE. Then it appears that this wave will intersect the ray FM at\r\nthe same point V where it is intersected at right angles by the curve\r\nEK, and consequently that the wave will touch this curve. In the same\r\nway it can be proved that the same will apply to all the other waves\r\nabove mentioned, originating at the points G, H, etc.; to wit, that\r\nthey will touch the curve EK at the moment when the piece D of the\r\nwave ED shall have reached E.\r\n\r\nNow to say what these waves become after the rays have begun to cross\r\none another: it is that from thence they fold back and are composed of\r\ntwo contiguous parts, one being a curve formed as evolute of the curve\r\nENC in one sense, and the other as evolute of the same curve in the\r\nopposite sense. Thus the wave KE, while advancing toward the meeting\r\nplace becomes _abc_, whereof the part _ab_ is made by the evolute\r\n_b_C, a portion of the curve ENC, while the end C remains attached;\r\nand the part _bc_ by the evolute of the portion _b_E while the end E\r\nremains attached. Consequently the same wave becomes _def_, then\r\n_ghk_, and finally CY, from whence it subsequently spreads without any\r\nfold, but always along curved lines which are evolutes of the curve\r\nENC, increased by some straight line at the end C.\r\n\r\nThere is even, in this curve, a part EN which is straight, N being the\r\npoint where the perpendicular from the centre X of the sphere falls\r\nupon the refraction of the ray DE, which I now suppose to touch the\r\nsphere. The folding of the waves of light begins from the point N up\r\nto the end of the curve C, which point is formed by taking AC to CX in\r\nthe proportion of the refraction, as here 3 to 2.\r\n\r\nAs many other points as may be desired in the curve NC are found by a\r\nTheorem which Mr. Barrow has demonstrated in section 12 of his\r\n_Lectiones Opticae_, though for another purpose. And it is to be noted\r\nthat a straight line equal in length to this curve can be given. For\r\nsince it together with the line NE is equal to the line CK, which is\r\nknown, since DE is to AK in the proportion of the refraction, it\r\nappears that by deducting EN from CK the remainder will be equal to\r\nthe curve NC.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the waves that are folded back in reflexion by a concave\r\nspherical mirror can be found. Let ABC be the section, through the\r\naxis, of a hollow hemisphere, the centre of which is D, its axis being\r\nDB, parallel to which I suppose the rays of light to come. All the\r\nreflexions of those rays which fall upon the quarter-circle AB will\r\ntouch a curved line AFE, of which line the end E is at the focus of\r\nthe hemisphere, that is to say, at the point which divides the\r\nsemi-diameter BD into two equal parts. The points through which this\r\ncurve ought to pass are found by taking, beyond A, some arc AO, and\r\nmaking the arc OP double the length of it; then dividing the chord OP\r\nat F in such wise that the part FP is three times the part FO; for\r\nthen F is one of the required points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd as the parallel rays are merely perpendiculars to the waves which\r\nfall on the concave surface, which waves are parallel to AD, it will\r\nbe found that as they come successively to encounter the surface AB,\r\nthey form on reflexion folded waves composed of two curves which\r\noriginate from two opposite evolutions of the parts of the curve AFE.\r\nSo, taking AD as an incident wave, when the part AG shall have met the\r\nsurface AI, that is to say when the piece G shall have reached I, it\r\nwill be the curves HF, FI, generated as evolutes of the curves FA, FE,\r\nboth beginning at F, which together constitute the propagation of the\r\npart AG. And a little afterwards, when the part AK has met the surface\r\nAM, the piece K having come to M, then the curves LN, NM, will\r\ntogether constitute the propagation of that part. And thus this folded\r\nwave will continue to advance until the point N has reached the focus\r\nE. The curve AFE can be seen in smoke, or in flying dust, when a\r\nconcave mirror is held opposite the sun. And it should be known that\r\nit is none other than that curve which is described by the point E on\r\nthe circumference of the circle EB, when that circle is made to roll\r\nwithin another whose semi-diameter is ED and whose centre is D. So\r\nthat it is a kind of Cycloid, of which, however, the points can be\r\nfound geometrically.\r\n\r\nIts length is exactly equal to 3/4 of the diameter of the sphere, as\r\ncan be found and demonstrated by means of these waves, nearly in the\r\nsame way as the mensuration of the preceding curve; though it may also\r\nbe demonstrated in other ways, which I omit as outside the subject.\r\nThe area AOBEFA, comprised between the arc of the quarter-circle, the\r\nstraight line BE, and the curve EFA, is equal to the fourth part of\r\nthe quadrant DAB.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nArchimedes, 104.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric refraction, 45.\r\n\r\nBarrow, Isaac, 126.\r\n\r\nBartholinus, Erasmus, 53, 54, 57, 60, 97, 99.\r\n\r\nBoyle, Hon.
