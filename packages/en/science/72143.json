Chemists are continually endeavouring\r\nto replace handsome and poisonous colours by others equally handsome\r\nbut non-poisonous.\r\n\r\nIn writing this work I have endeavoured to give it such a character\r\nthat it may be a text-book for the practical man, only those methods\r\nhave been given which certainly lead to a good result; in the case of\r\nnew pigments I have only described methods of preparation which I have\r\nmyself found to give good results.\r\n\r\nSince it cannot be imagined that any one quite ignorant of chemistry\r\ncould successfully manufacture colours (colours being always made by\r\nchemical processes which occasionally are rather complicated), I have,\r\ntherefore, presupposed a knowledge of the principles of chemistry. In\r\nthe short sketch of the chemical properties of the raw materials used\r\nin making ordinary pigments, the principal properties of the materials\r\nused by the colour maker are given.\r\n\r\nIn order to make this treatise useful to dealers in and consumers of\r\ncolours, the chapters dealing with the examination of pigments have\r\nbeen so arranged that the nature or adulteration of a pigment can be\r\ndetermined quickly and with certainty by any one.\r\n\r\nRecipes, which originated at a time when empiricism ruled in chemistry,\r\nhave been omitted, since they would only detract from the clearness of\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\nAs far as it is possible I have avoided the “recipe fetish,” and have\r\nendeavoured to make clear to the reader the chemical processes to which\r\nregard must be had in the manufacture of the different pigments. Since\r\nthe appearance of the first edition there have been many valuable\r\ninnovations in the mineral colour industry, to which regard has been\r\ngiven in preparing this second edition in so far as they possess a\r\nreally practical value.\r\n\r\nA critical examination of proposals and formulæ, which are found in\r\nlarge numbers in the journals, has been avoided, since I wished to\r\nkeep for my book that character of a reliable text-book and book of\r\nreference which was ascribed to it in the form of its first edition.\r\n\r\n    DR. JOSEF BERSCH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf excuse be needed for presenting a translation of Dr. Bersch’s book\r\nat so long an interval after the publication of the original (1893),\r\nit must be sought in the paucity of the English literature on the\r\nsubject. It is hoped that the practical nature of the work will make it\r\nacceptable to the English reader.\r\n\r\nThe subject-matter of the original has been preserved in the\r\ntranslation without alteration or addition, with the exception of an\r\nunimportant change in the order of arrangement.\r\n\r\nThe metric system of weights and measures has been used throughout;\r\nfor the convenience of those who are not familiar with this system,\r\ndirections are given in an appendix for converting into English weights\r\nand measures.\r\n\r\nThe section on paint grinding (Chapter LXIX.) is perhaps somewhat\r\nincomplete; for a more detailed and modern account of this branch of\r\nthe subject the reader is referred to _Practical Paint Grinding_, by\r\nMr. J. Cruickshank Smith, B. Sc., shortly to be issued by the same\r\npublishers.\r\n\r\n                                                        A. C.

The art of preparing colours is as ancient as their\r\nuse. It is true that we find from the most remote historical records\r\nthat the so-called earth colours were almost solely employed, and\r\nprincipally those which exist ready formed in nature. But these natural\r\ncolours also require their particular process of preparation before\r\nthey fulfil their object, even though this be merely a mechanical\r\noperation, such as powdering or levigating. That the oldest nations of\r\nwhom we possess lasting records, either written or otherwise, really\r\nunderstood the preparation of colours by chemical processes is shown\r\nby the common occurrence in the Egyptian mural pictures of figures\r\nclad in brightly coloured garments, a proof that the Egyptians not\r\nonly understood the science of colour manufacturing, but also the more\r\nadvanced art of fastening colours upon fabrics—dyeing.\r\n\r\nThe writings of the ancient Greeks, and in part also the scanty remains\r\nof their buildings, prove to us completely that they understood the\r\nuse of colours to such an advanced degree that they already employed\r\nthem for pictures as works of art. That the Greeks were also acquainted\r\nwith the preparation of colours and dyeing follows from various\r\npassages from the classical writers, in which magnificently decorated\r\nrooms and beautifully coloured garments are often described.\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans, who were the pupils of the Greeks in the arts and\r\nmanufactures, the prodigal luxury which existed in Rome, especially\r\nunder the emperors, caused a great demand for colours, which were used\r\nin the most profuse manner for the decoration of house and attire. The\r\nRoman colour makers had advanced so far in their art that they could\r\ncolour the human hair rose-red.\r\n\r\nA glance at East Indian fabrics and pictures, or at the ancient Chinese\r\nbuildings, whose colouring is a matter of marvel to-day, shows that\r\nthe Oriental were not behind the Western nations in the discovery of\r\ncolours and the art of manufacturing them.\r\n\r\nIn so old an industry it is not remarkable that great changes have\r\ntaken place in the course of time. The thousands and thousands of\r\nexperiments made by the alchemists in the attempt to prepare gold\r\nfailed in their main object, but the tremendous expenditure of time and\r\ntrouble in this work was not fruitless; upon the great mass of chemical\r\nfacts discovered by the alchemists were laid the foundations of\r\nscientific chemistry. We find on reading the writings of the alchemists\r\nthat the colour industry is indebted to them for an immense number of\r\nits products; the reason being that the alchemists worked by preference\r\non metals, earths and mineral compounds, and from these substances a\r\nlarge number of colours are obtainable, of which many are still in use\r\nto-day, and, on account of their cheapness, will continue in use.\r\n\r\nThe period in which the painters were also the colour makers lies not\r\nfar behind us. The preparation of many a colour of particular beauty\r\nwas treated by the fortunate owner of the recipe as a great secret. It\r\nwas sold by him at a great price. What a difference between that time\r\nand the present! There is now no painter among civilised races to whom\r\nit would occur to prepare his own colours; the chemical works provide\r\nthem for him at a low price and in such a condition that they can be\r\nimmediately used for painting. The Italian painters prepared the highly\r\nprized blue pigment, ultramarine, by laborious toil from the costly\r\n_lapis lazuli_; to-day, this same colour, more beautiful and deeper\r\nin hue, is made by several works, and sold at a price which bears no\r\ncomparison with that of the colour obtained from the mineral. The\r\nlatter was worth many times its weight in gold: a pound of the finest\r\nultramarine can now be bought for a shilling or two.\r\n\r\nWe find a similar comparison in the case of the fine scarlet pigment\r\nknown as vermilion: formerly the natural vermilion, cinnabar, was\r\nsold at a very high price; at the present time the finest vermilion,\r\nprepared artificially, can be bought at a low rate. It is no longer\r\nnecessary for any one to use natural Chinese vermilion as an artists’\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nWhilst formerly mineral colours were used in great preponderance, we\r\nnow know a great number of vegetable and animal colouring matters. The\r\ndiscovery of the sea route to India and the discovery of America had an\r\nimportant influence in this development. From these countries, as from\r\nother tropical lands, come the majority of the plants which contain\r\ncolouring matters. The attempt to change these colouring matters into\r\ninsoluble compounds led to the discovery of the lake pigments.\r\n\r\nWith the advance of chemical knowledge the number of colours grew\r\napace; _e.g._, the discovery of chromium was of great importance\r\nto the colour industry: it presented us with a large number of new\r\ncolours. To a more limited extent, the discovery and study of uranium,\r\nmolybdenum and other metals were the occasions for the invention of new\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nIn more recent times, efforts in the colour industry have been\r\nespecially directed to making colours more permanent and, at the same\r\ntime, harmless. In the first respect, the position at present leaves\r\nmuch to be desired; but, as regards the second property, great advances\r\nhave been made. The colours in use in former days were almost all very\r\npoisonous compounds; the greater number were derived from lead, copper,\r\nmercury or arsenic. More recently these poisonous substances have\r\nbeen in many cases replaced by innocuous materials, so that among the\r\ncolours now in use, though the list is much more comprehensive than of\r\nold, there are but few poisonous to a high degree.\r\n\r\nIn all civilised states the use of poisonous colours has been much\r\nrestricted by law, and in those cases in which an article is to be\r\nmanufactured for use as food the employment of such colouring matters\r\nhas been absolutely forbidden. For example, in Germany by the law\r\nof 5th July, 1887, concerning the use of dangerous colours in the\r\npreparation of foods and condiments, the application of the permissible\r\ncolours has been exactly defined.\r\n\r\nDuring the last decades the colour industry and, still more, dyeing\r\nhave undergone a complete change. The momentous discoveries which have\r\nbeen made in these departments leave far behind the advances which have\r\nbeen made in other branches of chemical technology, the manufacture\r\nof explosives, perhaps, excepted. We allude here to the beautiful\r\ncolours which have been made from coal-tar, colours which far surpass\r\nin beauty all hitherto known, and which we can already prepare in\r\nevery shade and hue. Unfortunately, we can only employ the coal-tar\r\ncolours, as such, in a restricted measure among the pigments; they\r\nare of more importance in dyeing. We use the term pigments here in\r\nthe narrow sense of such substances which, when spread out on certain\r\nmaterials, provoke a certain sensation of colour. Dyeing is, on the\r\ncontrary, that branch of colour chemistry which generally has for its\r\nobject the simultaneous production of the colour and its fixation upon\r\na fabric. This definition was at least applicable to the majority of\r\nthe colours which were in use before the discovery of the coal-tar\r\ncolours and their introduction into the industry. Since, however,\r\nthe latter have acquired so great a preponderance in dyeing, it is\r\nno longer applicable, for the dyers use at present a large number of\r\nsubstances which are included in the narrow definition of pigments. The\r\ngreater part of the coal-tar colours are substances which, in solution,\r\nwhen brought in contact with a fabric, adhere to it and colour it\r\npermanently.\r\n\r\nAccording to their use and preparation, pigments are divided into a\r\nnumber of classes, and one speaks of painters’, artists’, enamel,\r\nporcelain and glass colours, also of oil, honey, water and cake\r\ncolours. Although this division is important for trade purposes, it\r\nis of little moment for the colour maker, for he can prepare the same\r\ncolour for both purposes, either for oil or water colour. What is of\r\nthe greatest interest for the colour maker is the preparation of the\r\npigment itself. The conversion of the prepared pigment into (oil or\r\nwater) paint is unaccompanied by difficulties.\r\n\r\nWhen we look for a practical classification for pigments, we find that\r\nthere are colours which exist ready formed in nature, and others which\r\ncan only be obtained by certain chemical processes, at times very\r\ncomplicated.\r\n\r\nAs regards the first group of pigments—those which exist ready formed\r\nin nature—the processes which they undergo at the hands of the colour\r\nmaker are almost entirely mechanical treatments—grinding, sieving,\r\nlevigating and similar operations—in order to convert them into such\r\na condition that they can be used for painting. Since a large number\r\nof these pigments belong to that class of minerals which mineralogists\r\ncall earths, these pigments have also been designated earth pigments,\r\na term which we shall retain on account of its general use, although\r\nit is incorrect, since many of the so-called earth pigments are not\r\nobtained from “earths” in the mineralogical sense.\r\n\r\nAmong the pigments which are prepared by human skill many divisions can\r\nbe drawn. A large number of pigments are prepared from mineral sources;\r\nan equally important number are derived from the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdom, the latter consisting of combinations of organic materials\r\nwith certain inorganic substances. Some few pigments (putting aside the\r\ncoal-tar colours) are simply organic products, as, for example, the\r\nmajority of the black pigments, which consist of carbon.\r\n\r\nThe following classification is drawn up on the lines indicated above:—\r\n\r\n1. _Natural Colours or Earth Pigments._—Found ready formed in nature\r\nand requiring only mechanical preparation to be usable. A large number\r\nof handsome and also cheap colours belong to this class.\r\n\r\n2. _Artificially Prepared Mineral Pigments._—Obtained by certain\r\nchemical processes, and, according to their composition, either\r\ncompounds of metals with sulphur, oxygen, iodine, cyanogen, etc., or of\r\noxides with acids, i.e., salts.\r\n\r\n3. _Lakes._—Compounds of colouring matters from the animal or vegetable\r\nkingdom with a mineral substance, such as lead oxide or alumina.\r\n\r\nAs a fourth group we might take those colours which do not fall into\r\nthe previous classes, as, for example, the black pigments composed of\r\ncarbon; but since this division is not made in practice we shall not\r\nregard this species of pigment as a particular group, but shall discuss\r\nthem in the proper place.\r\n\r\nAs an entirely new group of colours are to be classed those which are\r\ngenerally called coal-tar colours. These colours, which, at present,\r\nare the most important in dyeing and calico printing, are prepared from\r\nso-called organic compounds (more properly, carbon compounds). The\r\nmanufacture of these colours is a separate branch of chemical industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE PHYSICO-CHEMICAL BEHAVIOUR OF PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a work which, as its title indicates, is devoted to a description of\r\nthe manufacture of pigments, the properties of those substances which\r\nare necessary for the preparation of colours cannot be exhaustively\r\nconsidered; we must, therefore, presuppose a knowledge of the elements\r\nof chemistry. We have to consider in this book the chemistry of\r\ncolours; the reader will, therefore, not expect an exposition of\r\ngeneral chemical laws; we shall only state certain facts which are of\r\nvalue to the manufacturer. With the description of the manufacture of\r\neach pigment and of the materials required for that manufacture, we\r\nshall still discuss the chemical processes which must be conducted in\r\nthe preparation of the colours, so far as it is necessary in order to\r\nunderstand them. In this chapter we shall say a few words about the\r\nphysical and chemical behaviour of pigments in general.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of pigments are prepared by the process of\r\nprecipitation, generally by mixing the solutions of two substances,\r\nupon which an interchange of the constituents occurs and the less\r\nsoluble compound separates in pulverulent form from the solution as a\r\nprecipitate. Most of these colours are obtained by the admixture of\r\nthe solutions of two salts; the preparation of the so-called chrome\r\nyellow may be taken as an example. In the preparation of this pigment,\r\na solution of a lead salt, sugar of lead (lead acetate), is mixed\r\nwith a solution of bichromate of potash, whereupon a precipitate of\r\nlead chromate (chrome yellow) is formed, whilst potassium acetate\r\nremains dissolved. The lead chromate is formed because the acetic acid\r\nhas a greater affinity for potash than for lead oxide, wherefore an\r\ninterchange of acid and base takes place, but the lead chromate being\r\ninsoluble in water consequently separates in the form of a precipitate.\r\n\r\nMany mineral pigments are produced in the form of precipitates by\r\npassing sulphuretted hydrogen or carbonic acid gas into certain metal\r\nsolutions. In these cases a similar exchange takes place between the\r\nreacting substances to that given in the case of chrome yellow; the\r\nmetals have a greater affinity for the sulphur or for the carbonic\r\nacid than for the substances with which they are already united, they\r\nunite with the former, and the new compound separates as an insoluble\r\nsubstance. We have examples of such compounds in cadmium sulphide,\r\nwhich is obtained by passing sulphuretted hydrogen into the solution\r\nof cadmium in an acid, and in white lead, which is formed by the\r\nsaturation of a solution of lead acetate by carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nMany organic colouring matters, soluble in water, have the property\r\nof forming compounds with metallic oxides, soluble with great\r\ndifficulty, when their solutions are mixed with a salt of lead, tin or\r\naluminium, and the oxide is separated from the solution by an alkali.\r\nThe precipitates obtained in this way are insoluble compounds of the\r\ncolouring matter and the oxide of the metal; they are called lake\r\npigments, or, briefly, lakes. A large number of pigments, often of\r\ngreat beauty, is obtained in this manner. The lakes are widely used in\r\nall branches of painting and dyeing.\r\n\r\nOf great importance for the quality of the pigment is the physical\r\ncondition of the precipitate; this is either crystalline or amorphous,\r\nthat is, non-crystalline. When a crystalline precipitate is examined\r\nunder the microscope, it is seen to consist of very small, coloured,\r\ntransparent crystals. The amorphous precipitates are, however, in such\r\na fine state of division that even with the highest magnification\r\nthey transmit little or no light, and consequently appear opaque.\r\nThese different characters of precipitates have the greatest influence\r\non that property of pigments which we call _covering power_. In\r\nconsequence of its transparency, a crystalline precipitate will allow\r\nthe colour of the surface upon which it is spread to appear through,\r\nhence it must be laid on much more thickly than is necessary with an\r\nopaque pigment, of which a thin coating is sufficient to make the\r\ncolour of the surface beneath invisible.\r\n\r\nHow extremely important is the crystalline or non-crystalline nature\r\nof a precipitate in practice is seen by a consideration of white lead.\r\nThis pigment, lead carbonate, can be made by mixing solutions of a\r\nlead salt and a soluble carbonate (soda); but in this case a lead\r\ncarbonate of crystalline nature is formed, which, being transparent, is\r\nof so small covering power that this process has no application in the\r\nmanufacture of white lead; but a far more troublesome method is used by\r\nwhich a non-crystalline product, amorphous lead carbonate, is obtained.\r\n\r\nMany pigments are formed by burning (oxidising) metals, as, for\r\nexample, zinc white; others are prepared by melting salts together, as\r\nNaples yellow; others again are formed by very complicated processes\r\nstill partially unexplained, as is the case with ultramarine. In the\r\nmanufacture of colours we find all chemical processes in use.\r\n\r\nIt may be here remarked that it is quite possible to manufacture some\r\ncolours, indeed a large number, according to fixed directions, without\r\nany particular chemical knowledge being necessary to carry on the\r\nprocesses. Indeed, in works we find most processes being carried out\r\nby ordinary labourers who are quite destitute of any knowledge of\r\nchemistry. We must, however, add that we are convinced that any colour\r\nmaker who works simply in a purely empirical manner, according to a\r\nstereotyped recipe, will never be in the position to raise himself\r\nabove the position of a workman; he will not be able, when a slight\r\nmishap occasions a change in the ordinary course of the process, to\r\ndevise a means of overcoming the defect, but will be compelled to\r\ndispose of the faulty product in the condition in which it exists. Such\r\na manufacturer is in a condition of blind dependence on the chemical\r\nworks and dealers from whom he receives the raw materials requisite\r\nfor the preparation of his colours. If he should receive materials\r\nwhich contain impurities not to be detected by empirical methods, the\r\ninevitable result will be that the colours produced from them will not\r\nbe equal to the standard. If, in making a colour which is the outcome\r\nof several processes, a workman once makes a mistake, the product will\r\nnot be of the required quality.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, if the manufacturer possesses a certain amount of\r\nchemical knowledge, it will not be difficult for him to ascertain the\r\ncauses of a failure in a process, and, at the same time, to devise\r\nmeans by which the defects may be removed. The manufacturer is more and\r\nmore in the habit of buying the chemicals which he requires for his\r\nmanufactures rather than of making them himself. He should, therefore,\r\nbe in a position to form an opinion as to the usability and purity of\r\nthese substances, which will only be possible when he has the knowledge\r\nrequisite for subjecting them to a chemical examination.\r\n\r\nAlthough we shall presuppose, as we have said, that those who intend to\r\nconcern themselves with colour manufacturing possess an acquaintance\r\nwith the principles of chemistry, yet this book has been so planned\r\nthat it may be of use (we hope) to the practical man who is innocent\r\nof chemical knowledge. On this account, we have devoted care to the\r\ndescription of those raw materials which are bought in large quantity,\r\nand to the simple investigation of their purity.\r\n\r\nWhen the manufacturer has the advantage of a chemical education, apart\r\nfrom his endeavours to produce colours lacking nothing in beauty or\r\ndepth of shade, he will direct his endeavours in two directions, in\r\nrespect of which great advances are yet to be made—the permanence and\r\nharmlessness of his colours.\r\n\r\nMany pigments possess the undesirable property of losing their\r\nbrightness under atmospheric influences; many, indeed, fade away\r\ncompletely in the course of time. We have only to examine a picture\r\nsome centuries old; in spite of the care bestowed on its preservation,\r\nwe can say with certainty that, in the course of time, it will be so\r\ncompletely altered that nothing will remain of the original colours.\r\nIt is the endeavour of the sensible manufacturer of colours to make\r\nonly such as remain unaltered by atmospheric action, and also undergo\r\nno change when they are mixed with other pigments. Although it may be\r\nhighly desirable that the painter should possess a knowledge of the\r\nchemical properties of the colours he uses, still it should be the\r\nfirst object of the maker to take care that he places on the market\r\nonly colours which will remain as much as possible unaltered when used\r\nalone, and will remain undecomposed when mixed. This is, unfortunately,\r\nnot the case with many colours now in use. We shall return later to\r\nthis point, of such extraordinary importance to the artist.\r\n\r\nThe second point to be observed, is to produce only harmless colours.\r\nThe advances of chemistry have made known to us a series of colours\r\nwhich have the advantage over others known for a longer period that\r\nthey are non-poisonous. Unluckily, these harmless colours frequently\r\nfall behind the poisonous colours in brilliance, and generally they are\r\nmore expensive. Here, too, is opened to the manufacturer a wide field\r\nof activity. The more completely poisonous substances disappear from\r\nthe colours in use, the more widespread will be the use of colours. We\r\nshould remark that the expression “poisonous colours” is to be used\r\nwith a certain reserve. Many pigments which contain lead, copper,\r\nantimony, mercury, etc., are poisonous, because they contain poisonous\r\nmetals; but poisoning with them will not readily take place on account\r\nof their insolubility. It is different with the very poisonous arsenic\r\ncompounds, which should be removed from the list of colours in common\r\nuse; many a misfortune caused by them would then be avoided.\r\n\r\nEndeavours to produce innocuous colours have been more successful than\r\nthe efforts after permanence. There are now very few commonly used\r\ncolours which can be accounted very poisonous compounds, and which\r\ncannot be replaced by other colours of equal beauty. On the whole, we\r\nare now in the position to prepare harmless colours suited to most\r\npurposes. Special endeavours should be made to sell these, so that\r\nsuch cases of poisoning should not occur as, for example, caused by\r\ngingerbread which had been wrapped in paper coloured by emerald green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nRAW MATERIALS EMPLOYED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have mentioned before, the manufacturer of colours now generally\r\nuses materials supplied to him by chemical works. The purer these are,\r\nthe easier it will be to work with them, and the finer will the colours\r\nturn out. We have indicated that it is important for the manufacturer\r\nto know accurately the properties of his materials in order to be\r\nable to estimate their value. Many substances required in certain\r\ncases must be made by the colour manufacturer, since, on account of\r\ntheir condition, they cannot form articles of commerce—chlorine and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, for example.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the substances which are not to be bought, there are\r\nothers which do occur in commerce, but are sold at so high a price that\r\nthe manufacturer is compelled to make them himself. This is the case\r\nwith the cobalt compounds, from which many beautiful colours are made.\r\nThe producers of these demand such prices that it is to the interest of\r\nthe colour maker to prepare them for his own use.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters, we shall deal with the more important\r\nraw materials which are employed in colour manufacturing, and shall\r\nrestrict our remarks to what is of particular importance thereto. For\r\nmore detailed accounts of these raw materials the reader is referred\r\nto the text books of chemistry, in which he will find them minutely\r\ndescribed, in so far as they are chemical products.\r\n\r\nThe materials employed may be divided into assistants in the processes\r\nand components of the manufactured pigment. The assisting substances\r\nare those which are used in the manufacture of a colour without\r\nentering into its composition; from the component materials the colours\r\nare directly derived. For example, in the manufacture of Prussian blue,\r\nyellow prussiate of potash, an iron salt, water (in which the salts are\r\ndissolved) and nitric acid are used. In the blue obtained are contained\r\nportions of the iron salt and of the yellow prussiate, these are,\r\ntherefore, component materials, whilst water and nitric acid are simply\r\nassistants, since they do not enter into the composition of the pigment.\r\n\r\nIn colour making a large number of assisting materials are employed,\r\nwhich comprise a considerable number of elements and compounds. Since\r\nthese are of great importance for our purpose, we shall describe their\r\nproperties, and, when necessary, briefly the method of preparation.\r\n\r\nAmong the component materials are to be reckoned a large number of\r\nsalts of the alkaline earth and earth metals and of all the heavy\r\nmetals. In addition, there are also the substances of animal or\r\nvegetable origin used in lake making.\r\n\r\nIn the description of the raw materials, if we were to overstep the\r\nline drawn here, we could include a great variety of compounds, those,\r\nfor example, used in the manufacture of the so-called aniline dyes.\r\nThese substances form, however, as we have stated, the object of a\r\nparticular branch of manufacture, which forms a separate division of\r\ncolour chemistry, but with which is not to be confounded what has been\r\nhitherto designated the manufacture of colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nASSISTANT MATERIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Water=, H₂O = 18.[1]—This substance plays a tremendous part in colour\r\nmaking; almost all the substances which are used in solution are\r\ndissolved in water; the removal from precipitates of admixed foreign\r\nbodies, the so-called washing, is always accomplished with water. The\r\nchemist does not understand by water quite that liquid which in general\r\nspeech is so designated. We must consider the water which is at the\r\ndisposal of the colour maker.\r\n\r\n[1] We append the chemical formula and the molecular weight to the\r\ndescription of each compound.\r\n\r\nWater, in the chemical meaning of the word, is a liquid composed only\r\nof hydrogen and oxygen, and leaving no residue when evaporated. Such\r\nwater is not found in nature; it can only be obtained by distillation\r\nof well or river water. The water which falls in long continued rain,\r\nor is obtained by melting snow, is most nearly like distilled water; it\r\ncontains only small quantities of dissolved substances, and generally\r\nsuch as would be without influence in colour making. Water of this\r\ndescription is available for but a limited use; the large quantities of\r\nwater required in a colour works must be taken from springs or streams.\r\nThese waters contain, however, more or less large amounts of dissolved\r\nsalts, which act in a marked manner upon the substances dissolved in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn almost all spring and well waters is found carbonate of lime;\r\nsuch waters are called “hard”. River water contains generally little\r\ncarbonate of lime; it is then called “soft water”. The influence of the\r\ncarbonate of lime is especially evident when salts of lead, copper,\r\niron and other heavy metals are dissolved in water; the carbonate of\r\nthe particular metal gradually separates from solution, and the liquid\r\nbecomes very turbid.\r\n\r\nWhen only hard waters containing much lime are at the service of the\r\nmanufacturer, turbid solutions are often obtained, which must be\r\nfiltered before use. In many cases this can be avoided by adding milk\r\nof lime to the water in a large vessel; the free carbonic acid unites\r\nwith the lime, and thus the carbonate of lime, which is only soluble in\r\nwater containing free carbonic acid, separates as a fine precipitate.\r\nWater which has been treated in this way becomes clear after some time,\r\nthrough the deposition of the carbonate of lime; it is then soft water.\r\nIn order to separate the carbonate of lime in this way, no more than\r\nthe requisite quantity of milk of lime should be added, so that no lime\r\nremains in excess, since this would cause precipitates when salts of\r\nlead, copper, iron, etc., were dissolved. In many cases—for example,\r\nwhen lead or barium salts are dissolved—the lime contained in the water\r\ncan be made harmless by slightly acidifying with acetic or nitric acid.\r\nWater which contains sulphate of lime (gypsum) is equally useless for\r\nmany purposes, as, for example, the solution of lead and barium salts.\r\nThese metals form insoluble compounds with the sulphuric acid, which\r\nrender the solution turbid, and can be removed only with difficulty by\r\nfiltering, on account of their great fineness. They are more easily\r\nremoved by allowing to settle.\r\n\r\nWater containing gypsum often contains in addition small quantities of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. However small the quantities of this gas may\r\nbe, they still make the water absolutely useless for certain purposes\r\nin the manufacture of colours; for example, for the preparation of\r\nall pigments containing lead which are obtained by precipitation. The\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen forms black compounds with lead, copper, bismuth,\r\nmercury and other metals, which impair the brilliance of the colour. A\r\ncolour made under these conditions is never clean, its hue is injured\r\nby the admixture of the black substance.\r\n\r\nWater which contains much common salt (sodium chloride) is unsuitable\r\nfor the solution of lead, mercury and silver salts. In consequence of\r\nthe great affinity of these metals for chlorine, turbid solutions are\r\nobtained when their salts are dissolved in water containing common salt.\r\n\r\nSome waters contain a considerable quantity of iron. Such waters\r\ndeposit on evaporation, and often on standing exposed to the air, a\r\nbrown powder of ferric hydrate, which would have considerable influence\r\non the shade of a pigment. White pigments, in the preparation of which\r\nsuch a water is used, have always a brownish tinge; yellow and red\r\npigments are also unfavourably affected.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime and common salt occur in small quantities in every\r\nwell water. The colour maker must do the best he can with such a water;\r\nits use will not particularly harm the shade of the colours prepared\r\nwith it if the amount of the impurities is not very large. Water\r\ncontaining much iron is practically useless; the oxide of iron would\r\ninjure the colours so much that it would not be possible to obtain\r\nbrilliant shades. Water from wells in the neighbourhood of deposits of\r\nturf or cemeteries often contains considerable quantities of organic\r\nsubstances which act injuriously on the shade of pigments; such water\r\nshould not be used in colour making.\r\n\r\nThe impurities in a water are more or less harmful according to the\r\npurpose for which it is to be used. Sulphate of lime is generally\r\nmore injurious than carbonate of lime, since the precipitates which\r\nthe latter causes in solutions of the salts of certain metals can be\r\nprevented by the addition of acids. This is not the case with sulphate\r\nof lime; when lead or barium salts are dissolved in water containing\r\nthis substance, a precipitate of lead or barium sulphate is obtained,\r\nwhich is insoluble.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the salts of costly metals, such as mercury or silver,\r\nit is better to dissolve them in distilled water, or, at least, very\r\npure rain water. The rain water which runs from zinc or well tiled\r\nroofs is generally very pure; for practical purposes it may be regarded\r\nas free from carbonate and sulphate of lime, sulphuretted hydrogen and\r\ncommon salt. The colour maker should take care to obtain as much of\r\nthis pure water as possible by erecting large rain-water tanks.\r\n\r\nThe less impurity a water contains the more useful it is for our\r\npurpose. After rain water soft river water is the best, and after this\r\nthe softer well waters. All mineral waters distinguished by a high\r\ncontent of salts or gases are quite useless for colour making; for this\r\nreason sea water is disqualified.\r\n\r\nAn accurate analysis of a water is much too complicated for the\r\nmanufacturer; it is sufficient for him to convince himself of the\r\nabsence of certain substances. Water which, some time after the\r\naddition of a little tannic acid solution, acquires a clear green or a\r\nbluish to black shade contains much iron, and is useless. Water which\r\ncoagulates a large quantity of a solution of soap in alcohol is very\r\nrich in carbonate or sulphate of lime. In order to decide approximately\r\nin what relative proportion these salts are present, a solution of\r\nbarium chloride is added to the water so long as a precipitate forms.\r\nIf this disappears completely on the addition of nitric acid, the\r\nwater contains only carbonate of lime; if it only partly dissolves,\r\nsulphate of lime is also present. The presence of chlorine is shown\r\nby a considerable turbidity on acidifying the water with nitric acid,\r\nboiling and adding silver nitrate. If the precipitate obtained on the\r\naddition of a lead salt is not pure white, but discoloured, the water\r\ncontains sulphuretted hydrogen, which has formed black lead sulphide.\r\nIn order to test the water for organic substances, about a litre is\r\nevaporated to dryness in a porcelain dish, and the residue heated to\r\nredness; if it turns brown and black, and possibly gives off a smell of\r\nburnt feathers, the water contains much organic matter.\r\n\r\nPure water is coloured permanently red by a solution of potassium\r\npermanganate; but if it contains organic matter, the solution is\r\ndecolourised after some time and a brown precipitate is deposited at\r\nthe bottom. From the amount of this precipitate an idea of the quantity\r\nof organic matter present may be obtained.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to be very scrupulous concerning the quality\r\nof the water when it is to be used for the solution of salts or the\r\nextraction of dye-woods. For washing precipitates, which requires a\r\nlarge volume of water, there can generally be used, without detriment,\r\nwater containing much lime, but it must be free from iron and\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. The latter is particularly harmful to most of\r\nthe lead colours, which would lose in beauty by washing with water\r\ncontaining this substance.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to say that the water used in colour making must\r\nbe quite clear. Muddy river water must in every case be completely\r\nfreed from the solid particles contained in it, either by settling or\r\nby filtering. Filters filled with well washed sand give good results\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\n=Chlorine=, Cl = 35·5.—For some operations in colour making it is\r\nnecessary to employ chlorine. This is a greenish yellow gas at\r\nordinary temperatures, which is characterised by a suffocating smell\r\nand the energy with which it unites with most elements. On account of\r\nits injurious effects on man certain precautions have to be observed\r\nin preparing chlorine, and it is advisable to erect the apparatus\r\nnecessary for its production in a separate room, so that the workmen\r\nare not injured by the gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nFormerly chlorine was exclusively made in lead apparatus, because this\r\nmetal is one of the least readily attacked. When such an apparatus is\r\nused for the first time a layer of lead chloride is formed, which,\r\nlike a varnish, protects the metal beneath from further attack. Fig.\r\n1 represents an apparatus formerly employed for the preparation of\r\nchlorine in chemical works. In the upper part of the pear-shaped\r\nvessel, K, there are four openings, two of which, D and C, are provided\r\nwith water lutes. This means that the opening is surrounded by a moat\r\ncontaining water, into which the rim of the cover dips, thus making\r\na joint. Through the middle opening goes the axle of the stirring\r\napparatus, R; in the fourth is a lead safety funnel, J. Solid materials\r\nare introduced through D, liquid through J; the tube C carries away the\r\nchlorine formed; the tube A, furnished with a stop cock, can draw off\r\nthe fluid contents of the apparatus.\r\n\r\nSince lead melts at low temperature, the apparatus cannot be heated\r\nover the fire without danger, therefore it is surrounded by an iron\r\njacket, W, which is filled with water, or else the apparatus is heated\r\nby steam introduced into W. Larger quantities of chlorine are more\r\nconveniently prepared in an apparatus, of similar structure, made of\r\nstone or earthenware, which have the advantage over lead that they are\r\nnot at all attacked by chlorine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nFig. 2 exhibits the construction of such an apparatus of medium size.\r\nIt is constructed of sandstone or earthenware; the lid and some of the\r\nsmaller parts can be made of either earthenware or lead. The pyrolusite\r\nis introduced at _G_ in large pieces; _H_ is the funnel for pouring\r\nin the acid; _E K D_, the steam pipe; _C_, the perforated false\r\nbottom upon which the pyrolusite lies; _F_, the delivery tube for the\r\nchlorine; _J_, the opening for running off the manganese chloride; _a_,\r\nthe leaden cover.\r\n\r\nTo prepare chlorine, 1 part (by weight) of common salt, 1 part of\r\npowdered pyrolusite, 2½ parts of vitriol and 1¼ part of water are\r\nused. The salt and the pyrolusite are introduced through _D_ into the\r\napparatus (Fig. 1); the acid, diluted with the water, is poured in\r\nthrough the funnel, the materials are mixed by the stirrer and gently\r\nwarmed until chlorine appears, when the application of heat must be\r\nconsiderably diminished or the chlorine will be violently evolved.\r\n\r\nPyrolusite and hydrochloric acid are now generally used for the\r\npreparation of chlorine, because the solution of manganese chloride,\r\nleft at the end of the operation, is valuable.\r\n\r\nIf all the chlorine made in one operation is not at once required for\r\nthe manufacture of a colour, it can be utilised by sending it into a\r\nbox filled with slaked lime, which is converted into chloride of lime\r\nor bleaching powder. The liquid run away from the apparatus at the\r\nconclusion of the operation contains manganese and sodium sulphates,\r\nor manganese chloride as the case may be, and can be used for the\r\npreparation of manganese pigments.\r\n\r\n=Ammonia=, NH₃ = 17.—Ammonia is obtained from chemical works in the\r\nform of a strong solution of ammonia gas in water, which is generally\r\nvery pure. The density of an aqueous solution of ammonia is the smaller\r\nthe more ammonia it contains, and thus the strength of a solution of\r\nammonia can easily be formed by means of the hydrometer. The following\r\ntable shows the percentage of ammonia, NH₃, in a liquid of known\r\nspecific gravity at the temperature of 14° C.:—\r\n\r\n    +-------------+------------+------------+------------+\r\n    |   Specific  |  Ammonia   | Specific   |  Ammonia   |\r\n    |   Gravity.  |  per cent. |  Gravity.  |  per cent. |\r\n    +-------------+------------+------------+------------+\r\n    |    0·885    |   36·00    |    0·953   |   11·50    |\r\n    |    0·886    |   35·00    |    0·955   |   11·00    |\r\n    |    0·889    |   34·00    |    0·957   |   10·50    |\r\n    |    0·891    |   33·00    |    0·959   |   10·00    |\r\n    |    0·893    |   32·50    |    0·961   |    9·50    |\r\n    |    0·895    |   32·00    |    0·963   |    9·00    |\r\n    |    0·897    |   31·30    |    0·965   |    8·50    |\r\n    |    0·900    |   26·00    |    0·968   |    8·00    |\r\n    |    0·905    |   25·39    |    0·970   |    7·50    |\r\n    |    0·925    |   19·54    |    0·972   |    7·00    |\r\n    |    0·932    |   17·52    |    0·974   |    6·50    |\r\n    |    0·947    |   13·46    |    0·976   |    6·00    |\r\n    |    0·951    |   12·00    |    0·978   |    5·50    |\r\n    +-------------+------------+------------+------------+\r\n\r\n_The Hydrometer._—In the above table the percentage content of the\r\nammonia solution is given according to its specific gravity, that is,\r\naccording to the ratio between the weight of any volume of the liquid\r\nand the weight of an equal volume of water. According to scientific\r\nprinciples, only those hydrometers should be used which are graduated\r\nin specific gravities. In spite of all exertions in this direction,\r\nmanufacturers have not yet been induced to use such instruments in\r\nevery case. Hydrometers, with quite arbitrary scales, such as those of\r\nBaumé and Twaddell, are frequently found in works. These hydrometers\r\ngenerally only show that a liquid is of so many degrees on the\r\nparticular scale, and the manufacturer in using them is restricted\r\nto the following out of a certain recipe which requires the use of\r\na liquid of a certain strength which is expressed in degrees Baumé,\r\netc. He does not learn by this how many per cent. of the particular\r\nsubstance are dissolved in the water when the liquid has a certain\r\nhydrometric strength.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of uniformity, it is urgently to be desired that all\r\nmanufacturers who use the hydrometer to estimate the content of a\r\nliquid in ammonia, potash, soda, hydrochloric, sulphuric, nitric acids,\r\netc., should employ simple specific gravities. This is desirable,\r\nbecause the percentage strength of a solution, corresponding to the\r\nspecific gravity, can be at once accurately found from tables. On\r\nthese grounds, in the present work, we have restricted ourselves to\r\ntables showing simply the specific gravities of solutions and the\r\ncorresponding composition.\r\n\r\n=Sal Ammoniac or Ammonium Chloride=, NH₄Cl = 53·5.—This substance comes\r\ninto commerce in the form of a white crystalline meal, more rarely in\r\nthe form of sugar loaves (crystallised sal ammoniac) or of flat cakes\r\n(sublimed sal ammoniac). It is usually very pure, since impure forms,\r\ngenerally containing much iron, are difficult of sale. At a particular\r\ntemperature sal ammoniac is volatile; it is used in certain mixtures\r\nin order to prevent the temperature, on heating, from rising beyond a\r\ncertain point. Like ammonia, it is more used in dyeing.\r\n\r\n=Ammonium Sulphide=, NH₄HS.—This compound is obtained by leading\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen into ammonia solution so long as it is dissolved,\r\nand a test portion of the liquid still gives a white precipitate with\r\na solution of magnesium sulphate. Ammonium sulphide decomposes by long\r\nstanding in the air, sulphur being separated. It gives precipitates\r\nwith the salts of certain metals, for example, iron, cobalt, manganese,\r\nzinc, nickel. These precipitates, which consist of the sulphides of the\r\nmetals, are not formed by sulphuretted hydrogen in acid solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nACIDS.\r\n\r\nIn colour making many acids are used for the solution of metals, the\r\nproduction of precipitates, for oxidations and so forth. Commercial\r\nacids, especially inorganic acids, generally contain not inconsiderable\r\nquantities of impurities which are injurious in the manufacture of many\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\n=Hydrochloric Acid=, HCl = 36·5.—The commercial acid (muriatic acid,\r\nspirits of salt) generally contains large quantities of iron,\r\nwhich colour it yellow—fortunately, in many cases, this is not a\r\ndisadvantage, and also at times the iron can be removed from solutions\r\nmade in the acid. Another impurity is sulphuric acid. This can be\r\ndetected by diluting and adding barium chloride; if sulphuric acid be\r\npresent, a white precipitate, or, at least, a cloudiness, appears.\r\n\r\nOrdinary hydrochloric acid is a solution of hydrochloric acid gas in\r\nwater. The strongest acid contains 42·85 per cent. of the gas, and has\r\nthe specific gravity 1·21. The following table gives the strengths of\r\nacids of various specific gravities:—\r\n\r\n    +------------+--------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n    |  Specific  | Hydrochloric |  Specific   | Hydrochloric |\r\n    |  Gravity.  |     Acid     |  Gravity.   |     Acid     |\r\n    |            |   per cent.  |             |   per cent.  |\r\n    +------------+--------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n    |   1·21     |     42·85    |    1·10     |     20·20    |\r\n    |   1·20     |     40·80    |    1·09     |     18·75    |\r\n    |   1·19     |     38·88    |    1·08     |     16·71    |\r\n    |   1·18     |     36·36    |    1·07     |     15·49    |\r\n    |   1·17     |     34·34    |    1·06     |     13·86    |\r\n    |   1·16     |     32·32    |    1·05     |     11·49    |\r\n    |   1·15     |     30·30    |    1·04     |      8·97    |\r\n    |   1·14     |     28·28    |    1·03     |      6·93    |\r\n    |   1·13     |     26·26    |    1·02     |      4·89    |\r\n    |   1·12     |     24·24    |    1·01     |      2·03    |\r\n    |   1·11     |     22·22    |             |              |\r\n    +------------+--------------+-------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n=Sulphuretted Hydrogen=, H₂S = 34.—This is a gas of acid properties\r\nsmelling like rotten eggs; it precipitates the sulphur compounds of\r\nmany metals when led into the acid solution of the corresponding\r\nsalt. This substance is seldom required in colour works, so that it\r\nis convenient to have an apparatus which permits of the preparation\r\nof any required quantity. Fig. 3 represents an apparatus devised by\r\nthe author, which is well adapted for the preparation of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen. It consists of a small, wooden tub, on whose upper edge lies\r\na thick paper ring, so that the lid may be pressed down air-tight by\r\nthe screws B. Through the lid pass a tap-funnel, T, a movable screw,\r\nS, and a tube, R, to carry away the gas. On the screw S hangs a basket,\r\nK, by a handle; this is filled with pieces of iron sulphide as large as\r\nnuts. The tub is filled to about one-third of its height with a mixture\r\nof 9 parts of water and 1 part of sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.]\r\n\r\nWhen sulphuretted hydrogen is required the basket is lowered by the\r\nscrew, S, until it dips in the liquid; according as the basket dips\r\nmore or less into the liquid a fast or slow current of the gas is\r\nobtained. When the gas is no longer required the basket is raised out\r\nof the liquid, and the evolution of gas at once ceases. The funnel, T,\r\nserves for the introduction of the liquid, the tap, H, for drawing off\r\nthe iron sulphate solution, which can be used with advantage for the\r\npreparation of fine iron colours. The apparatus should not be opened so\r\nlong as sulphide of iron remains in the basket.\r\n\r\n=Sulphuric Acid= comes into the market in two different forms: oil\r\nacid; both are used in colour making. _Oil of Vitriol_, H₂SO₄ = 98, is\r\na colourless, oily liquid of high specific gravity; it is generally\r\ntolerably pure, and contains, as a rule, only a small quantity of\r\nlead, the presence of which is indicated by a turbidity on largely\r\ndiluting the acid. The amount of pure sulphuric acid in the liquid\r\nis practically determined by taking the specific gravity. The table\r\nindicates the relation between the specific gravity and the content of\r\nsulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n    +-----------------+--------------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n    |Specific Gravity.|Sulphuric Acid|Specific Gravity.|Sulphuric Acid|\r\n    |                 |  per cent.   |                 |  per cent.   |\r\n    +-----------------+--------------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n    |      1·8485     |     100      |     1·8043      |      89      |\r\n    |      1·8475     |      99      |     1·7962      |      88      |\r\n    |      1·8460     |      98      |     1·7870      |      87      |\r\n    |      1·8439     |      97      |     1·7774      |      86      |\r\n    |      1·8410     |      96      |     1·7673      |      85      |\r\n    |      1·8376     |      95      |     1·7570      |      84      |\r\n    |      1·8336     |      94      |     1·7465      |      83      |\r\n    |      1·8290     |      93      |     1·7360      |      82      |\r\n    |      1·8233     |      92      |     1·7245      |      81      |\r\n    |      1·8179     |      91      |     1·7120      |      80      |\r\n    |      1·8115     |      90      |                 |              |\r\n    +-----------------+--------------+-----------------+--------------+\r\n\r\n_Nordhausen Sulphuric Acid_, H₂S₂O₇ = H₂SO₄ + SO₃, is generally a\r\nyellowish brown liquid, which gives off white fumes in the air. It\r\ncontains varying quantities of sulphur trioxide dissolved in sulphuric\r\nacid. It often contains selenium, which separates as a red powder when\r\nthe acid is diluted. The presence of this impurity does not interfere\r\nwith the use of the acid for dissolving indigo, the only purpose for\r\nwhich it is required in the colour factory.\r\n\r\n=Nitric Acid=, HNO₃ = 63.—This acid, which is used in the preparation\r\nof many colours, is distinguished by the readiness with which it gives\r\nup part of its oxygen, and thus converts metals like antimony and\r\nbismuth into oxides, and transforms other compounds into a higher state\r\nof oxidation. There are two kinds of nitric acid: ordinary nitric\r\nacid, a colourless liquid which is more or less pure; and fuming nitric\r\nacid, a yellow or orange-coloured liquid, fuming strongly in the air,\r\nwhich consists of a solution of nitrogen peroxide, NO₂, and nitric\r\noxide, NO, in nitric acid.\r\n\r\n    +----------------+--------------+----------------+--------------+\r\n    |Specific Gravity| Nitric Acid  |Specific Gravity| Nitric Acid  |\r\n    |   at 15° C.    |   per cent.  |   at 15° C.    |   per cent.  |\r\n    +----------------+--------------+----------------+--------------+\r\n    |     1·530      |    100·00    |     1·323      |     55·00    |\r\n    |     1·520      |     97·00    |     1·284      |     50·49    |\r\n    |     1·509      |     94·00    |     1·251      |     45·00    |\r\n    |     1·503      |     92·00    |     1·211      |     40·00    |\r\n    |     1·499      |     91·00    |     1·185      |     33·86    |\r\n    |     1·495      |     90·00    |     1·157      |     30·00    |\r\n    |     1·478      |     85·00    |     1·138      |     25·71    |\r\n    |     1·460      |     80·00    |     1·120      |     23·00    |\r\n    |     1·442      |     75·00    |     1·089      |     20·00    |\r\n    |     1·423      |     69·96    |     1·067      |     15·00    |\r\n    |     1·400      |     65·07    |     1·022      |     11·41    |\r\n    |     1·346      |     60·00    |     1·010      |      4·00    |\r\n    +----------------+--------------+----------------+--------------+\r\n\r\nSince the action of nitric acid chiefly depends on its oxidising\r\nproperties, which are possessed by both kinds, it generally does not\r\nmatter which is used. The usual impurities are chlorine and sulphuric\r\nacid; the presence of the first is shown by silver nitrate solution,\r\nof the latter by barium chloride, in each case added after diluting.\r\nWhen the acid is used for oxidations these impurities do not interfere,\r\nbut nitric acid containing chlorine cannot be used to dissolve silver,\r\nbecause the chlorine would form insoluble silver chloride.\r\n\r\nThe strength of nitric acid is gauged by its specific gravity as given\r\nin the table.\r\n\r\n=Aqua Regia.=—A mixture of 2 parts of hydrochloric acid and 1 part of\r\nnitric acid gradually turns orange or yellow and evolves chlorine. This\r\nliquid, which can dissolve gold in consequence of the free chlorine it\r\ncontains (hence its alchemistic name, from gold, the “king of metals”),\r\nis used as a very powerful oxidising agent in colour making.\r\n\r\n=Carbon=, C = 12, is the only one of the non-metallic elements to be\r\nmentioned here; by itself it forms a group of very important pigments,\r\nwhich we shall describe in detail at a later stage.\r\n\r\n=Carbonic Acid Gas=, CO₂ = 44, is used in the manufacture of white\r\nlead, which it precipitates from lead acetate. This is, however, a\r\nparticular branch of colour making carried on in special works. In\r\ndescribing this manufacture we shall return to the preparation of\r\ncarbonic acid on a large scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIC ACIDS.\r\n\r\nThe organic acids which are important in colour making are acetic,\r\noxalic and tartaric acids.\r\n\r\n=Acetic Acid=, C₂H₄O₂ = 58.—The very dilute form of this substance\r\nis known commonly as vinegar, the stronger as pyroligneous acid, and\r\nthe purest as glacial acetic acid; the latter is, however, scarcely\r\nused. Formerly in colour making ordinary vinegar was used, but now\r\npyroligneous acid is almost exclusively employed. This is distinguished\r\nby its strong empyreumatic smell, which, however, is without importance\r\nin colour making.\r\n\r\nThe strength of a solution of acetic acid cannot be found by a simple\r\nestimation of specific gravity, since the density does not increase\r\nwith the percentage of acetic acid. If an accurate estimation of\r\nthe strength of acetic acid is required, it must be obtained by\r\nneutralising the acid with an alkali by a process of volumetric\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes, where it is generally known whether a very\r\nstrong or a more dilute acetic acid is under consideration, the\r\nfollowing table, showing the connection between specific gravity and\r\npercentage strength, is sufficient.\r\n\r\n    +--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n    |Specific| Acetic  |Specific| Acetic  |\r\n    |Gravity.|  Acid   |Gravity.|  Acid   |\r\n    |        |per cent.|        |per cent.|\r\n    +--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n    | 1·0635 |   100   | 1·058  |    48   |\r\n    | 1·0670 |    98   | 1·055  |    46   |\r\n    | 1·0690 |    96   | 1·054  |    44   |\r\n    | 1·0706 |    94   | 1·052  |    42   |\r\n    | 1·0716 |    92   | 1·051  |    40   |\r\n    | 1·0730 |    90   | 1·049  |    38   |\r\n    | 1·0730 |    88   | 1·047  |    36   |\r\n    | 1·0730 |    86   | 1·045  |    34   |\r\n    | 1·0730 |    84   | 1·042  |    32   |\r\n    | 1·0730 |    82   | 1·040  |    30   |\r\n    | 1·0735 |    80   | 1·038  |    28   |\r\n    | 1·0732 |    78   | 1·035  |    26   |\r\n    | 1·0730 |    76   | 1·033  |    24   |\r\n    | 1·0720 |    74   | 1·031  |    22   |\r\n    | 1·0710 |    72   | 1·027  |    20   |\r\n    | 1·0700 |    70   | 1·025  |    18   |\r\n    | 1·0700 |    68   | 1·023  |    16   |\r\n    | 1·0690 |    66   | 1·020  |    14   |\r\n    | 1·0680 |    64   | 1·017  |    12   |\r\n    | 1·0670 |    62   | 1·015  |    10   |\r\n    | 1·0670 |    60   | 1·012  |     8   |\r\n    | 1·0660 |    58   | 1·008  |     6   |\r\n    | 1·0640 |    56   | 1·005  |     4   |\r\n    | 1·0630 |    54   | 1·002  |     2   |\r\n    | 1·0620 |    52   | 1·001  |     1   |\r\n    | 1·0600 |    50   |   ——   |    ——   |\r\n    +--------+---------+--------+---------+\r\n\r\n=Oxalic Acid=, C₂H₂O₄.2H₂O = 126, has but a limited use in colour\r\nmaking. It comes into commerce in the form of more or less pure white\r\ncrystals which readily dissolve in water, and are almost pure oxalic\r\nacid, containing only small quantities of oxalate of lime, the presence\r\nof which is without importance for the purposes to which the acid is\r\nput in colour making. Frequently, instead of oxalic acid, the acid\r\npotassium oxalate (salt of sorrel) is used.\r\n\r\n=Tartaric Acid=, C₄H₆O₆ = 150, occurs as white or yellowish crystals,\r\nwith a slightly burnt smell, which dissolve readily in water, and have\r\na strong acid taste. The pure acid, which is white and without smell,\r\nis considerably dearer than the yellow variety. The impurities of the\r\nlatter, which are small in quantity, are without influence on the\r\ncolours prepared by its help, so that this form is generally used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nMETALLIC COMPOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nALKALIS.\r\n\r\nThe compounds of the alkali metals, potassium and sodium, play a\r\nconsiderable part in colour making. Formerly the potassium compounds\r\nwere in general use, but the sodium compounds are at present obtainable\r\nat a much lower price, and in most cases they can be used equally well.\r\nThus, in colour making, sodium compounds are chiefly employed. The\r\ncyanogen compounds are an exception; their potassium compounds are used\r\nexclusively.\r\n\r\n=Potassium Compounds.=—The potassium compounds which are chiefly\r\nused in colour making are potassium carbonate (potashes, pearl-ash),\r\npotassium hydroxide (caustic potash), potassium nitrate (saltpetre),\r\npotassium tartrate (tartar), and potassium ferrocyanide and\r\nferricyanide (yellow and red prussiate of potash). The cyanogen\r\ncompounds have peculiar properties. We shall describe them separately\r\nafter the potassium and sodium compounds.\r\n\r\n=Potassium Carbonate= (carbonate of potash), K₂CO₃ = 138, is known\r\ncommercially as potashes, a name derived from its former method of\r\npreparation by heating the ashes of plants in pots. At present potashes\r\nare prepared in large quantities from other sources.\r\n\r\nPure potash forms crumbling lumps with a slight yellow or bluish grey\r\ntinge, rapidly absorbing moisture from the air, and in time completely\r\nliquefying. The yellowish tinge is caused by oxide of iron, the bluish\r\nby manganese compounds. The so-called calcined potash has been strongly\r\nheated, and thus all organic substances contained in it have been\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nPotashes are in no way pure potassium carbonate; they contain a mixture\r\nof all those salts which are found in plants—potassium sulphate and\r\nchloride, small quantities of silicic acid, etc. These impurities are\r\nrarely harmful, still it is generally necessary to know the percentage\r\nof pure potassium carbonate contained in potashes.\r\n\r\nAlthough at present in commerce the strength of potashes is frequently\r\nguaranteed, it is still desirable to estimate the strength. It is\r\nsufficient for practice to allow a small quantity, say 100 grammes, to\r\nstand with an equal quantity of very cold water for some hours, then\r\nto filter and pour a similar quantity of water over the residue on\r\nthe filter. The weight of undissolved substance subtracted from 100\r\ngives with sufficient accuracy the weight of pure potassium carbonate\r\ncontained in 100 parts of potashes. This method is founded on the fact\r\nthat potassium carbonate dissolves readily even in cold water, but the\r\nother salts with difficulty. This procedure can also be used to obtain\r\npure potassium carbonate from crude potashes; it is only necessary to\r\nfilter and evaporate to dryness the solution obtained by pouring very\r\ncold water on crude potashes.\r\n\r\n=Potassium Hydroxide= (Potassium Hydrate, Caustic Potash), KOH =\r\n56.—The commercial variety consists of very deliquescent white lumps,\r\ngenerally containing a large quantity of impurities. On this account\r\ncaustic potash, or rather a solution of it, is prepared in the colour\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nWith this object 11 parts of potash, contained in a tub with an opening\r\nat the bottom, are mixed with 100 parts of cold water. Two hours\r\nlater, the clear solution is run off into a clean iron pan, in which\r\nit is heated to boiling. To the boiling solution is added milk of\r\nlime prepared from water and 3·5 parts of quicklime. After the liquid\r\nhas boiled a few minutes, a small portion is filtered and hydrochloric\r\nacid added to the clear filtrate; if no effervescence occurs, then\r\nall the potassium carbonate is converted into caustic potash. Should\r\neffervescence occur, milk of lime is added until a new portion no\r\nlonger effervesces on the addition of hydrochloric acid. Then the pan\r\nis covered with a well-fitting lid, and the cooled liquid, if not\r\nrequired for immediate use, preserved in well-corked glass bottles.\r\n\r\nThe strength of a caustic potash solution can be found by means of a\r\nhydrometer. The following table shows the relation between the specific\r\ngravity of a solution and the percentage of caustic potash it contains:—\r\n\r\n    +----------+----------------+\r\n    | Specific | Caustic Potash |\r\n    | Gravity. |   per cent.    |\r\n    +----------+----------------+\r\n    |   1·06   |       4·7      |\r\n    |   1·11   |       9·5      |\r\n    |   1·15   |      13·0      |\r\n    |   1·19   |      16·2      |\r\n    |   1·23   |      19·5      |\r\n    |   1·28   |      23·4      |\r\n    |   1·39   |      32·4      |\r\n    |   1·52   |      42·9      |\r\n    |   1·60   |      46·7      |\r\n    |   1·68   |      51·2      |\r\n    +----------+----------------+\r\n\r\n=Potassium Nitrate= (Saltpetre), KNO₃ = 101, consists of large\r\ncrystals, which quickly dissolve in water. On heating it readily gives\r\nup oxygen, and thus finds use as an oxidising agent. In former times,\r\nwhen the colour manufacturer was compelled to make his own materials,\r\nsaltpetre was of great importance in colour making; at present, when\r\nsuch materials are to be bought at low prices and no colour maker\r\nprepares his own, saltpetre is little used.\r\n\r\n=Potassium Bitartrate=, C₄H₅KO₆ = 188.—This salt, known as tartar\r\nin large crystals, and as cream of tartar in the form of meal, is\r\noccasionally used in colour making. It is little soluble in cold water,\r\nbut more easily in hot. The hot solution is generally used.\r\n\r\n=Potassium Bichromate= (Bichromate of Potash), K₂Cr₂O⁷ = 295.—This salt\r\nis made in special works, by melting chrome iron ore with saltpetre and\r\nextracting the mass with water, when a yellow solution of potassium\r\nchromate is obtained; to this sulphuric acid is added, which unites\r\nwith half the potassium, thus leaving potassium bichromate, which is\r\nobtained by evaporation of the solution in fine red crystals. These\r\nare purified by recrystallisation. At present, in place of the above\r\nmethod, calcium chromate is formed by roasting chrome iron ore with\r\nlime; the calcium chromate is then decomposed by a soluble potassium\r\nsalt, thus forming potassium chromate.\r\n\r\nPotassium bichromate is unaltered in air; it dissolves easily in\r\nwater, and is of great importance in the preparation of many colours,\r\nin particular chromium oxide and the lead pigments. The commercial\r\nsalt generally contains potassium sulphate, with which at times it is\r\nintentionally adulterated. The adulteration is detected by dissolving\r\nin water, adding half the volume of pure hydrochloric acid, and\r\ncautiously and carefully dropping in spirits of wine. A rapid action\r\ntakes place, which is only assisted by warming when necessary. The red\r\nliquid changes to emerald green. If barium chloride be now added, a\r\nwhite precipitate is obtained in the presence of potassium sulphate.\r\n\r\n=Potassium Sodium Chromate=, KNaCrO₄ = 279, is also used in colour\r\nmaking. Its solution is made by adding soda to a solution of potassium\r\nbichromate so long as an effervescence of carbonic acid occurs, and\r\nuntil the liquid turns red litmus paper blue; the solution of the\r\ndouble salt is yellow.\r\n\r\n=Chrome Alum=, KCr(SO₄)₂.12H₂O = 499.—This salt occurs in commerce\r\nas beautiful violet crystals. It is obtained as a by-product in the\r\nmanufacture of aniline and anthracene dyes, and may often be bought\r\nat lower prices than other chromium salts; 100 parts of water dissolve\r\napproximately 20 parts of chrome alum.\r\n\r\n=Potassium Ferrocyanide=, K₄Fe(CN)₆.3H₂O = 422.—The potassium iron\r\ncyanogen compounds are made in special works, particularly in the\r\nneighbourhood of large towns, by melting potashes with nitrogenous\r\norganic substances and iron, washing out the mass and purifying the\r\nsalt so obtained by recrystallisation. Potassium ferrocyanide (yellow\r\nprussiate of potash) forms large transparent crystals of a peculiar\r\nsoft nature, which dissolve readily in water. It often contains\r\nconsiderable quantities of potassium sulphate, up to 5 per cent., and\r\nit is to be noted that the impurity is much the cheaper of the two\r\nsalts. When barium chloride is added to a solution of the salt, a white\r\nprecipitate forms if sulphate be present.\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of yellow prussiate towards iron salts is noteworthy.\r\nWith ferrous salts, for example green vitriol (copperas), it gives a\r\nwhite precipitate which gradually turns blue in the air; with ferric\r\nsalts, for example ferric chloride (“nitrate of iron”), it at once\r\ngives a blue precipitate.\r\n\r\n=Potassium Ferricyanide= (Red Prussiate of Potash), K₃Fe(CN)₆ = 329,\r\nis obtained by passing chlorine through a solution of yellow prussiate\r\nuntil the liquid smells strongly of chlorine and no longer gives\r\na precipitate with a solution of a ferric salt. The solution then\r\ncontains potassium ferricyanide and chloride. The former is obtained by\r\nevaporating and allowing to crystallise.\r\n\r\nPure potassium ferricyanide forms beautiful dark red crystals, which\r\nreadily dissolve in water. The solution gives a blue precipitate with\r\nferrous salts, but only a brown colouration and no precipitate with\r\nferric salts. Both yellow and red prussiate are used in the preparation\r\nof several much used colours, for Prussian and Chinese blues, and\r\nseveral others. All cyanogen compounds, with the exception of yellow\r\nprussiate, are extremely poisonous. The following table gives the\r\nsolubility of potassium ferricyanide at different temperatures:—\r\n\r\n    +-----------------------+------------+----------------+\r\n    |  100 Parts of Water   |Temperature.|Specific Gravity|\r\n    |dissolve Parts of Salt.+------------+  of Solution.  |\r\n    |                       |    °C.     |                |\r\n    +-----------------------+------------+----------------+\r\n    |         33            |     4.44   |     1.151      |\r\n    |         36            |    10.00   |     1.164      |\r\n    |         40.8          |    15.50   |     1.178      |\r\n    |         58.8          |    37.80   |     1.225      |\r\n    |         77.5          |   100.00   |     1.250      |\r\n    |         82.6          |   104.40   |     1.265      |\r\n    +-----------------------+------------+----------------+\r\n\r\n=Sodium Salts.=—In chemical properties the sodium salts are very\r\nsimilar to the potassium salts, and, being cheaper, they are generally\r\nused in place of the latter.\r\n\r\n=Sodium Carbonate= (Soda Crystals), Na₂CO₃.10H₂O = 286, is made in\r\nenormous quantities in great works and in a very pure state. It forms\r\nlarge transparent crystals, which effloresce in the air, losing a\r\nlarge quantity of water, and so falling to a white powder. Although\r\nthis property does not interfere with the use of soda, since it is\r\ngenerally used in solution, yet efflorescence should be as far as\r\npossible avoided by keeping the salt in well-closed packages, because\r\neffloresced soda dissolves more slowly than crystallised, since it has\r\nto combine with water before it can enter into solution.\r\n\r\nIn the retail trade a form of soda is found which is adulterated with\r\nvery large quantities of Glauber’s salt. This is recognised by the\r\ndifferent form of the crystals. Manufacturers sell soda stating its\r\nstrength. The colour maker should only buy with this guarantee.\r\n\r\n=Sodium Hydroxide= (Sodium Hydrate, Caustic Soda), NaOH = 40, comes\r\ninto commerce in the form of hard masses, the use of which would be\r\nvery convenient for the colour maker if it were not often very impure.\r\nThus it is better to prepare a solution oneself, which is accomplished\r\nin the manner given above for caustic potash.\r\n\r\nCaustic soda and caustic potash have similar properties; they have a\r\ncorrosive action on the skin, readily unite with carbonic acid from the\r\nair, and separate the heavy metals from their solutions in the form of\r\nhydrated oxides.\r\n\r\nThe strength of caustic soda solutions is given in the following table:—\r\n\r\n    +----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n    | Specific | Caustic  | Specific | Caustic  |\r\n    | Gravity. |   Soda   | Gravity. |   Soda   |\r\n    |          | per cent.|          | per cent.|\r\n    +----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n    |   2·00   |   77·8   |   1·40   |   29·0   |\r\n    |   1·85   |   63·6   |   1·36   |   26·0   |\r\n    |   1·72   |   53·8   |   1·32   |   23·0   |\r\n    |   1·63   |   46·6   |   1·29   |   19·0   |\r\n    |   1·56   |   41·2   |   1·23   |   16·0   |\r\n    |   1·50   |   36·8   |   1·18   |   13·0   |\r\n    |   1·47   |   34·0   |   1·12   |    9·0   |\r\n    |   1·44   |   31·0   |   1·06   |    4·7   |\r\n    +----------+----------+----------+----------+\r\n\r\nBesides soda and caustic soda, few soda salts are used in colour\r\nmaking. However, sodium nitrate (Chili saltpetre), NaNO₃, is frequently\r\nused instead of ordinary saltpetre, from which it differs in being\r\ndeliquescent.\r\n\r\n=Sodium Thiosulphate= (Hyposulphite), Na₂S₂O₃.5H₂O = 248, is a common\r\narticle of commerce, being much used by photographers; it is used in\r\na few cases in colour making. It forms large crystals with a somewhat\r\nbitter taste, permanent in air and readily soluble in water.\r\n\r\n=Sodium Chloride= (Common Salt), NaCl = 58·5, which has a little\r\napplication in colour making, is sufficiently pure in the form in which\r\nit is generally used for household purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALTS OF THE ALKALINE EARTH METALS.\r\n\r\nThe metals which are known as the alkali earth metals have much\r\nsimilarity with the alkali metals in their compounds, with the\r\ndifference that their alkalinity is much less, and that their salts\r\nare much less soluble in water. For colour making the compounds of\r\nthree of these metals—calcium, barium and magnesium—are used.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCIUM COMPOUNDS.\r\n\r\nThe most important calcium compounds are lime and carbonate and\r\nphosphate of lime. Carbonate of lime is used as a pigment, and will be\r\ndealt with in detail among the mineral colours; it will be but briefly\r\ndescribed here.\r\n\r\n=Calcium Oxide= (Quicklime), CaO = 56.—When chalk and limestone, which\r\nconsist of calcium carbonate, are heated, carbonic acid is evolved, and\r\ncalcium oxide, commonly called quicklime, is left. For our purposes\r\nonly very pure quicklime is to be used. Its ordinary impurities are\r\niron oxide and magnesia: the former is found in lime made from red or\r\nbrown limestone; the latter in lime made from dolomitic limestone. The\r\npresence of oxide of iron is recognised by the reddish tinge of the\r\nquicklime; if magnesia be present, a small quantity of the quicklime,\r\nwhen mixed with a very large quantity of water, leaves an insoluble\r\nresidue which consists of magnesia.\r\n\r\nWhen quicklime and water are brought together they unite very\r\nenergetically and form calcium hydroxide or slaked lime. According to\r\nthe quantity of water used for slaking, either dry slaked lime, lime\r\npaste, or milk of lime is produced, all of which find a use in colour\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\n=Calcium Hydroxide= (Slaked Lime), Ca(OH)₂ = 74.—In order to prepare\r\nslaked lime, which contains lime united with just the necessary\r\nquantity of water, the pieces of quicklime are sprinkled with water\r\nfrom a watering can. The water is rapidly taken up and the sprinkling\r\nis repeated until the lumps begin to fall to a fine powder; in the\r\nprocess the lime becomes very hot. The slaked lime is then passed\r\nthrough a sieve in order to separate the larger pieces of quicklime\r\nwhich have not been slaked; the powder must be kept in well closed\r\npackages, since it energetically absorbs carbonic acid out of the air.\r\n\r\nIf so much water is added to the lime that a homogeneous wet mass is\r\nformed which can be readily moved with a shovel, one has then lime\r\npaste, which can be conveniently kept in pits as the masons do; it may\r\nbe stored in this way for many months without appreciable alteration,\r\nstill it is better to keep it covered. To prepare milk of lime, so\r\nmuch water is used in slaking that a milky liquid is formed, or the\r\nlime paste is mixed up in the proper quantity of water. Slaked lime\r\ndissolves in 700 to 800 parts of water; on standing, the undissolved\r\nslaked lime settles to the bottom of the milk of lime: thus it is\r\nbetter to prepare milk of lime immediately before use, and to stir it\r\nwell to prevent the settling of the solid particles.\r\n\r\nSlaked lime in one of its forms is often used instead of the more\r\ncostly caustic soda in order to precipitate metallic oxides from their\r\nsalts.\r\n\r\nAt times one finds a too strongly burnt lime, so-called “dead-burnt”\r\nlime, which is very slowly slaked by water. Such quicklime is slaked by\r\nallowing it to lie in water for days, or by means of hot water, which\r\naccomplishes the slaking more quickly.\r\n\r\n=Calcium Carbonate=, CaCO₃ = 100, is found naturally in large\r\nquantities as chalk, which consists of the skeletons of extremely small\r\nanimals. By powdering and levigating, it is converted into a soft\r\npowder, which is used to lighten the shade of lakes and other colours.\r\n\r\n=Calcium Sulphate= (Gypsum), CaSO₄.2H₂O = 172.—This mineral, when\r\nfinely powdered, is added to some colours.\r\n\r\n=Calcium Phosphate= (Bone Ash), Ca₃(PO₄)₂ = 310, is sometimes used to\r\nlighten the shade of certain colours which might be injured by calcium\r\ncarbonate. It comes in large quantities as a fine, white powder from\r\nSouth America. Naturally, only quite white bone ash can be used; if not\r\ncompletely burnt it is grey, and will then impair the shade of colours\r\nwith which it is mixed.\r\n\r\n=Magnesium Carbonate= (Magnesia), MgCO₃ = 84, is also used as an\r\naddition to colours in order to obtain pale shades. It is most cheaply\r\nobtained by dissolving magnesium sulphate (Epsom salts) in water and\r\nadding soda solution so long as a precipitate forms, which is then\r\nwashed and dried. The magnesium carbonate prepared in this way is a\r\nvery fine, light powder, insoluble in water, which can be mixed with\r\nthe most delicate colours without harming them. White magnesia is an\r\nextremely light powder, which may be used when it can be bought at as\r\nlow a price as the above preparation.\r\n\r\n=Barium Compounds.=—The raw material used for the preparation of barium\r\npigments is either barium sulphate (barytes, heavy spar) or barium\r\ncarbonate (witherite). The latter is much more rare than barytes, which\r\nis almost exclusively employed in the preparation of barium compounds.\r\nThe barium compounds of particular importance for our purpose are\r\nbarium chloride and nitrate.\r\n\r\n=Barium Chloride=, BaCl₂.2H₂O = 244.—This salt is now a common article\r\nof trade, and can be bought at a low price. When pure it forms\r\ncolourless crystals readily soluble in water. If the colour maker is\r\nable to get cheap barytes and fuel, it may be advantageous for him to\r\nprepare barium chloride himself.\r\n\r\nTo prepare barium chloride from barytes, the latter is very finely\r\nground and levigated, intimately mixed with coal, and the mixture\r\nsubjected to a very high temperature, when barium sulphide is formed,\r\nwhich is dissolved by washing out the mass with water and converted\r\ninto barium chloride by adding hydrochloric acid, sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nbeing evolved.\r\n\r\nThe best method is to mix 4 parts of barytes with 1 part of bituminous\r\ncoal and so much coal-tar that a plastic mass is formed, which is well\r\nkneaded and made into small cylinders 3 centimetres in diameter and 10\r\ncentimetres long. These cylinders are placed in layers in a cylindrical\r\nfurnace with a good draught, which contains at the bottom a layer of\r\ncoal 15 to 20 centimetres thick, then a layer of the cylinders, then\r\nagain coal, and so on until the furnace is full. The lowest layer\r\nof coal is lighted, and the whole burnt at a bright red heat, when\r\nthe barium sulphate is changed into sulphide. Hydrochloric acid is\r\npoured over the residue and the insoluble part, consisting chiefly of\r\nunaltered barytes, is used for the next operation.\r\n\r\nWitherite (barium carbonate) can be converted into barium chloride in a\r\nvery simple manner. Hydrochloric acid is added, in which it dissolves\r\nwith the evolution of carbonic acid. The solution is allowed to stand\r\ntwenty-four hours with excess of witherite; the whole of the dissolved\r\niron is thus precipitated. The solution is then filtered, evaporated\r\ndown and left, when pure barium chloride crystallises out.\r\n\r\nBarium chloride and all soluble barium salts should only be dissolved\r\nin pure water (rain or distilled). Water which contains carbonates\r\nor sulphates always gives a turbid solution by precipitating barium\r\ncarbonate or sulphate.\r\n\r\n\r\nALUMINIUM COMPOUNDS.\r\n\r\nThe compounds of the earth metal aluminium play a very important part\r\nin colour making, since they form beautifully coloured compounds with\r\nmany organic colouring matters. Formerly alum was the only material\r\nused in colour factories for the preparation of the alumina compounds;\r\nat present aluminium sulphate is used, and when it is sufficiently pure\r\nit is the most valuable material, because it contains the greatest\r\nquantity of alumina.\r\n\r\nUnder the designation of alum only one compound, the so-called potash\r\nalum, was at one time found in commerce, but now there are other alums,\r\nwhich contain soda or ammonia in place of potash. These salts are of\r\nequal use in colour making to potash alum. The preference is to be\r\ngiven to the compound which contains the largest proportion of alumina.\r\nThe chief point to be observed in connection with alumina compounds for\r\nuse in colour making is that they shall be free from iron, because iron\r\noxide, which would be precipitated out of the solution along with the\r\ncolours, in consequence of its red colour would spoil the shade of the\r\npigment.\r\n\r\n=Aluminium Sulphate= (Sulphate of Alumina), Al₂(SO₄)₃.18H₂O = 664.—Any\r\nmanufacturer who can obtain cheap china clay (kaolin) and sulphuric\r\nacid can himself prepare this compound with advantage. The apparatus\r\nused for this purpose is an iron pan containing sand, in which is\r\nplaced a large earthenware dish. In this dish are put very finely\r\nground kaolin and strong sulphuric acid, and the mixture is heated so\r\nstrongly that the acid boils, evolving heavy, white vapours. It is\r\nabsolutely necessary to heat in this manner in order to avoid dangerous\r\naccidents. Sulphuric acid bumps so violently on boiling that it may\r\neven break a thick earthenware dish. The use of a sand bath makes the\r\nbumping harmless.\r\n\r\nChina clay, which consists of silicate of alumina, is decomposed by\r\nheating with sulphuric acid into silicic acid and sulphate of alumina.\r\nThe original milky liquid becomes more transparent during boiling, and\r\nhas at last the appearance of starch paste. Kaolin contains varying\r\nquantities of silica. The quantity of sulphuric acid necessary for its\r\ndecomposition can only be found by trial. The quantities are chosen so\r\nthat a small amount of kaolin remains undecomposed in order that the\r\naluminium sulphate shall contain no free sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nWhen the decomposition is finished the pan is allowed to cool and the\r\nsolid mass is brought into a vat filled with water, in which it is\r\nstirred until dissolved; then the liquid is left until the jelly-like\r\nmass of silicic acid has sunk to the bottom, when the clear solution of\r\naluminium sulphate is drawn off and can at once be used.\r\n\r\nIf solid aluminium sulphate is required—and this is to be recommended\r\nwhen large quantities are to be prepared—the solution is evaporated\r\nin earthenware dishes until a portion solidifies when dropped on a\r\ncold plate. The molten aluminium sulphate is then cast in prismatic\r\nblocks, which are preserved in boxes. These blocks are of a pure white\r\ncolour and very crystalline; they dissolve with difficulty in cold, but\r\nreadily in hot water without residue. The solution has an acid taste,\r\neven when it contains no excess of sulphuric acid. When the blocks have\r\na yellowish tinge, this denotes the presence of iron, and the solution\r\nmust be freed from this impurity. Nowadays sulphate of alumina can be\r\nobtained so cheaply that it is hardly of advantage to make it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALUMS.\r\n\r\nThese are double salts of aluminium sulphate and potassium, sodium or\r\nammonium sulphate. There are also other double sulphates known as alums\r\nwhich, in place of aluminium, contain chromium, iron, etc., but they\r\nare not of interest here. It may still be observed that all alums,\r\nwhatever their composition, possess the property of crystallising\r\ntogether from mixed solutions, so that crystals can be obtained in\r\nwhich every existing alum is contained.\r\n\r\nThe potassium, sodium and ammonium aluminium alums are used in colour\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\n=Potassium Aluminium Alum=, KAl(SO₄)₂.12H₂O = 474.—This is the\r\nsubstance commonly called alum. Like all alums it crystallises in\r\nfine octahedral crystals, which at first are quite transparent, but\r\nslowly effloresce in the air and become covered by a white powder.\r\nIt dissolves with difficulty in cold, but readily in hot water. The\r\nsolution has at first a sweet taste, with an astringent after-taste.\r\n\r\nAlum comes into the market in different forms, of which the following\r\nare the most important: as crystallised alum, in the form of large\r\ncrystals united together; as alum meal, a coarse crystalline powder\r\nobtained by rapidly cooling and stirring a hot alum solution. On\r\naccount of the larger surface this form dissolves more quickly than the\r\nlarge crystals. Roman alum is the name of a variety chiefly imported\r\nfrom Italy; it owes its reputation to its great purity—it contains a\r\nvery small quantity of iron.\r\n\r\nIn order to prepare alum quite free from iron from the ordinary alum\r\ncontaining iron, it is recrystallised, that is, as much as possible\r\nis dissolved in boiling water and the solution quickly cooled with\r\ncontinual stirring; the small crystals so obtained are then washed with\r\ncold water. The residual saturated solution of alum, which contains\r\nthe greater part of the iron, can be used for the preparation of those\r\ncolours which are not injured by the presence of iron.\r\n\r\nThe solubility of alum in water varies greatly at different\r\ntemperatures. The table gives the weight of alum dissolved by 100 parts\r\nof water at different temperatures.\r\n\r\n    +------------+------------------+---------------+\r\n    |Temperature.|Crystallised Alum.|Anhydrous Alum.|\r\n    +------------+------------------+---------------+\r\n    |    0° C.   |        3·90      |      2·10     |\r\n    |   10° ”    |        9·52      |      4·99     |\r\n    |   20° ”    |       15·13      |      7·74     |\r\n    |   30° ”    |       22·01      |     10·94     |\r\n    |   40° ”    |       30·92      |     14·88     |\r\n    |   50° ”    |       44·11      |     20·09     |\r\n    |   60° ”    |       66·65      |     26·76     |\r\n    |   70° ”    |       90·67      |     35·11     |\r\n    |   80° ”    |      134·47      |     45·66     |\r\n    |   90° ”    |      209·31      |     58·64     |\r\n    |  100° ”    |      357·48      |     74·53     |\r\n    +------------+------------------+---------------+\r\n\r\nWhen potash alum is heated it loses water, 75 per cent. of the total\r\nat 61° C.; at 92° C. it melts completely, and all the water is lost by\r\ncontinued heating at 100° C. The residue is known as burnt alum.\r\n\r\nIn alum the whole acidity of the sulphuric acid is not neutralised;\r\nthe solution has always an acid reaction; if soda solution is added,\r\nthe escaping carbonic acid causes the liquid to effervesce. If soda\r\nsolution is added until a further addition would cause a precipitate,\r\na solution of so-called neutral alum is formed which has no longer\r\nan acid reaction. Neutral alum is occasionally required in colour\r\nmaking. In preparing it the soda solution must be added with great care\r\nwhen the liquid is near its point of neutralisation. Any addition of\r\nsoda solution after this point is reached will cause a separation of\r\nalumina. This is not desirable, since it is generally only wished to\r\nprecipitate the alumina in combination with colouring matters.\r\n\r\n=Roman Alum.=—Under this name, or that of “cubic alum,” a variety of\r\nalum is sold, generally at a rather higher price than ordinary alum,\r\nfrom which it is distinguished by its crystalline form. Ordinary alum\r\nforms octahedral crystals often the size of a child’s head, but cubic\r\nalum well formed cubes.\r\n\r\nThe property of crystallising in cubes may be imparted to any alum\r\nsolution by the addition of a little potash. Much so-called Roman alum\r\nis made in German works in this way. When this alum contains very\r\nlittle iron it is quite equal in quality to the best Roman alum, for\r\nthe higher value of the latter is entirely due to its small content of\r\niron. The alum prepared in the province of Naples is still better than\r\nRoman alum; it contains less iron.\r\n\r\nWhen alum is required for the preparation of lakes of bright and\r\ndelicate shades, it is indispensable to use a preparation free from\r\niron, because the brownish yellow oxide of iron would appreciably\r\ninjure the shade. Alum, free from iron, is most simply prepared by\r\ndissolving alum in boiling water, running the boiling solution quickly\r\nthrough a cloth, and quickly cooling with constant stirring. The alum\r\nmeal prepared in this way contains much less iron than the original\r\nalum, the iron salts remaining dissolved in the mother liquor. When\r\nthis alum meal is collected and cold water poured over it to free it\r\nfrom mother liquor, it is generally sufficiently pure to be used for\r\nany purpose, but if not, it is again recrystallised. The alum liquors\r\ncontaining the iron are used for the preparation of colours which are\r\nnot injured by the presence of iron.\r\n\r\nTo test alum for iron yellow prussiate of potash is used, which gives\r\na blue precipitate with ferric salts. The test is carried out by\r\ndissolving 10 grammes of alum in 1 litre of water, placing the solution\r\nin a tall, narrow cylinder standing on white paper, adding 10 to 20\r\ndrops of a saturated solution of yellow prussiate, and well stirring.\r\nOn looking down through the liquid, if a distinct colouration is at\r\nonce evident, the alum contains much iron, and must be recrystallised;\r\nindeed, the crystals would generally be coloured yellow. On the\r\ncontrary, if the solution does not show a blue tint until after\r\nstanding several days, the alum contains but a small quantity of\r\niron, and can be used for most purposes without further purification.\r\nAlum quite free from iron is a rare commercial article; the test will\r\ngenerally show a feeble blue colouration. If this is not intense and\r\nno blue precipitate is deposited at the bottom, the alum is tolerably\r\npure, and can be used in colour works. The longer the time before the\r\nblue colouration appears the poorer is the alum in iron.\r\n\r\n=Soda Alum=, NaAl(SO₄)₂.12H₂O = 458, is made in some alum works. It\r\nhas the greatest similarity in properties with the potash salt, but\r\nis distinguished by a much greater solubility in water and more rapid\r\nefflorescence in air. Soda alum can be bought at varying prices; that\r\ncontaining iron is much cheaper than that free from iron. When the\r\nlatter is to be bought at a fair price it is to be preferred to potash\r\nalum, since, as we shall show later, it contains a larger proportion of\r\nalumina.\r\n\r\n=Ammonia Alum=, (NH₄)Al(SO₄)₂.12H₂O = 453.—This compound of aluminium\r\nsulphate and ammonium sulphate is now often met with; the more\r\nexpensive potassium sulphate in ordinary alum is replaced by ammonium\r\nsulphate, which is cheaply obtained from the ammoniacal liquor of the\r\ngas works.\r\n\r\nAmmonia alum is better for our purpose than potash alum since it\r\ncontains more alumina, is generally cheaper and dissolves more easily\r\nin water. Unfortunately most commercial ammonia alum contains so much\r\niron that it has to be recrystallised before it can be used in colour\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nOne hundred parts of water dissolve at different temperatures the\r\nquantities of ammonia alum given in the table:—\r\n\r\n    +------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n    |Temperature.|Crystallised Ammonia Alum.|Anhydrous Ammonia Alum.|\r\n    +------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n    |    0° C.   |            5·22          |          2·62         |\r\n    |   10° ”    |            9·16          |          4·50         |\r\n    |   20° ”    |           13·66          |          6·57         |\r\n    |   30° ”    |           19·29          |          9·05         |\r\n    |   40° ”    |           27·27          |         12·35         |\r\n    |   50° ”    |           36·51          |         15·90         |\r\n    |   60° ”    |           51·29          |         21·95         |\r\n    |   70° ”    |           71·97          |         26·09         |\r\n    |   80° ”    |          103·08          |         35·19         |\r\n    |   90° ”    |          187·82          |         50·30         |\r\n    |  100° ”    |          421·90          |         70·83         |\r\n    +------------+--------------------------+-----------------------+\r\n\r\nOf the different alums, ammonia alum contains the largest and potash\r\nalum the smallest proportion of alumina.

In\r\na colour works, in which large quantities of alum are used, it is\r\nadvantageous to work with ammonia alum which is recrystallised on the\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nThe alums and aluminium sulphate are the alumina compounds in ordinary\r\nuse in colour works; aluminium acetate could also be used if it were to\r\nbe had at a reasonable price.\r\n\r\n=Alumina=, Al₂O₃ = 102, =and Hydrate of Alumina=.—Pure alumina, or\r\nrather hydrate of alumina, is required in the preparation of many\r\ncolours. When the solution of an aluminium salt is precipitated by\r\nsoda, the carbonic acid escapes with effervescence, and a gelatinous\r\nprecipitate is formed which it is extremely difficult to wash clean.\r\nThe precipitate, which consists of hydrate of alumina, shrinks very\r\ngreatly in drying, and turns to a horny mass; when strongly heated it\r\nloses water, and becomes a white, insoluble powder of anhydrous alumina.\r\n\r\nA variety of hydrate of alumina, heavy, and therefore easily washed, is\r\nobtained by boiling a solution of alum with a plate of zinc lying on a\r\ncopper plate until all the alumina has separated. By collecting this on\r\na filter and pouring hot water over it a number of times it is obtained\r\nquite pure.\r\n\r\nAlumina plays a particularly important part in the manufacture of\r\ncobalt colours. When treated with a cobalt salt and heated it takes a\r\nfine blue shade.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing those metals and their compounds have been treated\r\nwhich are extensively used in preparing colours without themselves\r\nforming coloured compounds. The chromates and prussiates are an\r\nexception to this. The ammonia compounds, the alkalis and alkaline\r\nearths, also the acids, are used in making many colours, although\r\nthey do not contain colouring principles. The alumina compounds are\r\nin similar case. Themselves colourless, they form at the same time a\r\ncarrier for the coloured compound and bring it into a suitable form for\r\nuse as a pigment.\r\n\r\nAn example will explain what we mean by “carrier” of the colouring\r\nmatter. Logwood contains a very handsome colouring matter which can be\r\nextracted by water. In order to be able to employ this colouring matter\r\nas a pigment it is combined with alumina, a compound insoluble in water\r\nbeing formed, which is called a lake. In this compound the alumina is\r\nto be regarded as the carrier of the colouring matter, which it has\r\nfixed in an insoluble form.\r\n\r\nIn dyeing, which in many respects is closely allied to colour making,\r\nthe property of certain metallic compounds, themselves colourless, of\r\nfixing dyes is commonly utilised, the metallic compound being called\r\nthe mordant. The fabric is first prepared with the metallic compound or\r\nmordant, and the colour then formed by bringing the mordanted material\r\nin contact with the colouring matter.\r\n\r\nThe “heavy metals” form, among their numerous compounds, a great number\r\nof coloured substances, and several of them are distinguished by a\r\ngreat wealth of coloured derivatives; for example, copper, chromium\r\nand cobalt form coloured compounds only. Although the use of pigments\r\nderived from the heavy metals has been considerably restricted in\r\nrecent years by the discovery of a series of colouring matters which\r\nreplace them, yet they are now, and always will be, of very great\r\nimportance in the manufacture of colours. It is, therefore, necessary\r\nbriefly to describe the various metals which are used in colour making,\r\nso that the manufacturer may know what metals produce harmless colours,\r\npermanent and unaltered by the atmosphere, and what do not.\r\n\r\nThe metals are divided into two great groups, designated, according\r\nto their specific gravities, the group of the light and of the heavy\r\nmetals. The light metals comprise the alkali, alkaline earth and earth\r\nmetals, whose important compounds we have just described. The specific\r\ngravity of each of these metals is less than five times that of water.\r\n\r\nThe heavy metals have a specific gravity exceeding 5; they are\r\ngenerally divided into groups, which are known by the name of the\r\ncommonest metal in the group. These are as follows:—\r\n\r\n    Zinc group         Zinc,      Zn = 65.\r\n    Iron group         Iron,      Fe = 56.\r\n    Tungsten group     Tungsten,  W  = 184.\r\n    Antimony group     Antimony,  Sb = 120.\r\n    Tin group          Tin,       Sn = 119.\r\n    Lead group         Lead,      Pb = 207.\r\n    Silver group       Silver,    Ag = 108.\r\n    Gold group         Gold,      Au = 197.\r\n    Platinum group     Platinum,  Pt = 194.\r\n\r\nTo the zinc group belong the metals zinc, cadmium and indium, of which\r\nonly the two first are of importance here. The iron group comprises\r\niron, manganese, cobalt, nickel, chromium and uranium, all of which\r\nare used in the manufacture of colours. The antimony group contains\r\nantimony and bismuth, the latter of which is of little importance.\r\nTo the tin group belong tin and the rare metals titanium, zirconium,\r\nthorium, niobium and tantalum; of these tin alone is important in\r\ncolour making. In the lead group are lead and thallium; lead produces\r\nmany important pigments. The silver group contains silver, copper and\r\nmercury, the two latter of which are important. Of the gold group gold\r\nalone is of interest, and its importance has been diminished by the\r\ndiscovery of far cheaper substances which replace it. In the platinum\r\ngroup, which contains platinum, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium, palladium\r\nand osmium, only platinum itself is used as a colour; it is employed\r\nin porcelain painting to produce the peculiar metallic shimmer known\r\ntechnically as “lustre.”\r\n\r\nThe behaviour of the compounds, of the metals mentioned above towards\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen is of the greatest importance to the colour\r\nmaker, since on it depends the alterability of the pigments when\r\nexposed to the atmosphere. Many metallic compounds are unaltered by the\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen present in the air, whilst others are in a high\r\ndegree affected by it and become gradually darker, so that their colour\r\nmay in the end approximate to black.\r\n\r\nThe pigments containing lead, copper, mercury and bismuth are extremely\r\nsusceptible to the action of sulphuretted hydrogen, by the action of\r\nwhich they form black compounds. Since colours which contain these\r\nmetals are not permanent, but darken considerably, endeavours have been\r\nmade for a long time to replace them by others not susceptible to the\r\naction of sulphuretted hydrogen. Thus it is desirable to manufacture\r\nonly colours free from metals forming black compounds with sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen. For the same reason pigments which contain sulphur should\r\nnot be mixed with those containing metals which form black sulphur\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\nThe rules laid down in the preceding paragraphs are of the greatest\r\nimportance for the artist, for by following them he will succeed in\r\ncomposing a “permanent palette,” that is, containing only such colours\r\nas will not, by their composition, bring about the speedy ruin of the\r\npainting.\r\n\r\nAlthough the majority of the compounds of the heavy metals are\r\npoisonous, some possess this property in an eminent degree. These are\r\nchiefly colours which contain arsenic, antimony, copper and lead. So\r\nfar as it is possible, these colours should be dispensed with and\r\nharmless pigments sold in their place, though this is not always\r\npossible, since several poisonous colours cannot be replaced by\r\ninnocuous ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOUNDS OF THE HEAVY METALS.\r\n\r\n=Zinc Compounds.=—Zinc oxide, ZnO, and zinc sulphate, ZnSO₄.7H₂O, are\r\nthe compounds of this metal used in the colour industry. Zinc oxide,\r\nwhich is used as a white pigment, is a powder which turns yellow when\r\nheated, and is not acted upon by sulphuretted hydrogen. Zinc sulphate\r\n(white vitriol) occurs as colourless crystals, or more frequently as\r\ngreyish white crystalline masses. The freedom of zinc sulphate from\r\niron is of particular importance; the commercial article is seldom\r\nsatisfactory in this respect. In order to free commercial zinc sulphate\r\nfrom iron, the property of zinc hydroxide of precipitating iron oxide\r\nfrom neutral solutions may be employed. The zinc sulphate is dissolved\r\nin water, and ammonia added in small quantities until the precipitate\r\nof zinc hydroxide remains on stirring. When the liquid is left in\r\ncontact with the precipitate and stirred up once or twice a day, if\r\niron is present the precipitate will turn yellowish brown, owing to the\r\nseparation of ferric hydroxide, and in the course of a few days all the\r\niron will be removed from solution. The liquid should then give no blue\r\ncolouration with yellow prussiate of potash.\r\n\r\nZinc oxide is used as a white pigment, zinc chromate as a yellow, and\r\nzinc cobalt compounds as green colours.\r\n\r\n=Cadmium Compounds.=—Cadmium is a metal which possesses great\r\nsimilarity to zinc, with which it occurs in nature. In the preparation\r\nof cadmium compounds the metal is generally used. This is dissolved in\r\ndilute sulphuric acid, hydrogen is evolved, and a solution of cadmium\r\nsulphate obtained.\r\n\r\nCadmium is used in colour making only for the preparation of the\r\nbeautiful cadmium yellows.\r\n\r\n=Iron Compounds.=—These are of the greatest importance to the colour\r\nmaker. Several, in which iron alone is the colour principle, are very\r\nvaluable: ochre, rouge, Venetian red, sienna and umber, for example.\r\nIron compounds are also used in the preparation of many colours. The\r\nmost important is:—\r\n\r\n=Ferrous Sulphate= (Green Vitriol, Copperas), FeSO₄.7H₂0.—This\r\nsubstance, which occurs commercially in a form of great purity at a\r\nvery low price, is generally the starting point in the preparation\r\nof iron pigments. When pure, it forms fine sea-green crystals, with\r\nan astringent metallic taste, which are not poisonous and are easily\r\nsoluble in water. After long exposure to the air, ferrous sulphate\r\nbecomes covered with an ochre-coloured crust, consisting of basic\r\nferric sulphate. The ferrous oxide contained in the green vitriol has\r\nunited with oxygen and been converted into ferric oxide. The latter\r\nrequires a larger quantity of acid than ferrous oxide for the formation\r\nof soluble salts, so that an insoluble basic salt is separated. The\r\nsame thing occurs when a solution of ferrous sulphate is exposed to the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nWhen green vitriol, or any other ferrous salt, is exposed to the\r\naction of oxidising agents, such as chlorine or nitric acid, the iron\r\nis rapidly changed into the ferric state. This transformation is of\r\nparticular importance in the manufacture of certain blue pigments.\r\n\r\nWe give in a table the relation between the percentage of crystallised\r\nferrous sulphate (FeSO₄.7H₂O) contained in a solution at 15° C. and its\r\nspecific gravity:—\r\n\r\n    +--------+-----------------+--------+-----------------+\r\n    |Specific|  Percentage of  |Specific|  Percentage of  |\r\n    |Gravity.|Ferrous Sulphate.|Gravity.|Ferrous Sulphate.|\r\n    +--------+-----------------+--------+-----------------+\r\n    | 1·000  |        0        | 1·118  |       21        |\r\n    | 1·005  |        1        | 1·125  |       22        |\r\n    | 1·011  |        2        | 1·131  |       23        |\r\n    | 1·016  |        3        | 1·137  |       24        |\r\n    | 1·021  |        4        | 1·143  |       25        |\r\n    | 1·027  |        5        | 1·149  |       26        |\r\n    | 1·032  |        6        | 1·155  |       27        |\r\n    | 1·037  |        7        | 1·161  |       28        |\r\n    | 1·043  |        8        | 1·168  |       29        |\r\n    | 1·048  |        9        | 1·174  |       30        |\r\n    | 1·054  |       10        | 1·180  |       31        |\r\n    | 1·059  |       11        | 1·187  |       32        |\r\n    | 1·065  |       12        | 1·193  |       33        |\r\n    | 1·071  |       13        | 1·200  |       34        |\r\n    | 1·077  |       14        | 1·206  |       35        |\r\n    | 1·082  |       15        | 1·213  |       36        |\r\n    | 1·088  |       16        | 1·219  |       37        |\r\n    | 1·094  |       17        | 1·226  |       38        |\r\n    | 1·100  |       18        | 1·232  |       39        |\r\n    | 1·106  |       19        | 1·239  |       40        |\r\n    | 1·112  |       20        |   ——   |       ——        |\r\n    +--------+-----------------+--------+-----------------+\r\n\r\nYellow and red prussiate, which have been already mentioned, also\r\nbelong to the iron compounds. They have been separately mentioned\r\nbecause the iron is contained in them in a peculiar form as a portion\r\nof an organic radical.\r\n\r\n=Ferrous Chloride=, FeCl₂, may sometimes be used instead of green\r\nvitriol. When iron is dissolved in hydrochloric acid hydrogen is given\r\noff and a solution of ferrous chloride is obtained; but when rouge is\r\ndissolved in the same acid, ferric chloride is formed. When iron is\r\ndissolved in nitric acid, in consequence of the oxidising properties of\r\nthis acid a ferric salt is obtained. Iron forms two series of salts:\r\nin the ferrous compounds the iron is in the same form as in green\r\nvitriol and the corresponding salts; in the ferric compounds the iron\r\nis contained in a higher state of oxidation. By powerful oxidising\r\nagents, as nitric acid or chlorine, ferrous compounds are converted\r\ninto ferric.\r\n\r\n=Manganese Compounds.=—Manganese (Mn) is a metal whose compounds show\r\ngreat similarity with those of iron, like which it forms two oxides\r\n(also others), manganous oxide (MnO) and manganic oxide (Mn₂O₃). The\r\nsalts of manganous oxide are not oxidised in the air like those of\r\nferrous oxide.\r\n\r\nThe raw material used in the preparation of manganese compounds is the\r\nmineral pyrolusite, which is manganese dioxide (MnO₂).\r\n\r\nManganese sulphate (MnSO₄) forms rose-red crystals containing varying\r\nquantities of water. The residues from the preparation of chlorine can\r\nbe used as the material for the preparation of colours. According as\r\npyrolusite and hydrochloric acid or pyrolusite, salt and sulphuric acid\r\nare used for this purpose a solution of manganous chloride or sulphate\r\nis obtained.\r\n\r\nManganese compounds have but a restricted use in colour making.\r\n\r\n=Nickel Compounds= are generally coloured green, but they are not used\r\nas pigments.\r\n\r\n=Cobalt Compounds.=—Among these are found many important pigments. All\r\ncobalt compounds are coloured; in beauty and variety of shade they can\r\nonly be compared with those of chromium. In properties cobalt is very\r\nsimilar to iron and nickel.\r\n\r\nThe form in which cobalt is used in preparing colours is either cobalt\r\nnitrate, Co(NO₃)₂.6H₂O, or cobalt chloride, CoCl₂.6H₂O. Both salts are\r\narticles of commerce, but generally they are so dear that it is more\r\nprofitable for the colour maker to prepare them direct from the cobalt\r\nminerals. A simple method for preparing cobalt compounds from the ores\r\nis therefore given. The most important cobalt ores are speiss cobalt,\r\na compound of cobalt and arsenic, and cobalt glance, a compound of\r\ncobalt, arsenic and sulphur. The former mineral often contains only\r\nsmall quantities of cobalt, and it is advisable for our purposes to use\r\ncobalt glance, which contains from thirty to forty per cent. of cobalt.\r\nThis mineral is first roasted, that is, is heated with a plentiful air\r\nsupply, by which means the arsenic is driven off. On account of the\r\npoisonous nature of the arsenic vapours the roasting must be conducted\r\nin a furnace with a very good draught.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of zaffre, roasted cobalt ores come into commerce. These\r\nmay be used in the preparation of cobalt compounds, by which means\r\nthe operation of roasting is avoided. According to the quality of the\r\nore which has been used to obtain zaffre, it contains a very varying\r\nproportion of cobalt. The varieties richer in cobalt must be used; they\r\nare technically known by the mark FS, or FFS (the best).\r\n\r\nThe roasted cobalt ores or zaffre are treated with fused acid potassium\r\nsulphate, when the salts of iron and manganese are decomposed, whilst\r\ncobalt and nickel sulphates remain unchanged. In a Hessian crucible\r\nare melted 300 parts of acid potassium sulphate, and 100 parts of the\r\npowdered zaffre are gradually added, mixed with one part of green\r\nvitriol and one part of saltpetre; the mixture is heated so long as\r\nsulphuric acid escapes. The mass is then boiled with water and the red\r\nsolution treated with sulphuretted hydrogen so long as a precipitate\r\nis formed; this may contain copper, manganese, and bismuth. After\r\nfiltering, soda is added to the boiling liquid; cobalt carbonate is\r\nprecipitated, which can be converted into nitrate or chloride by\r\nsolution in the corresponding acid. If cobalt sulphate is required,\r\nthe solution, after treatment with sulphuretted hydrogen, need only be\r\nevaporated to crystallisation, when the sulphate separates in fine red\r\ncrystals. Cobalt nitrate and chloride are very soluble in water; to\r\nobtain them their solutions must be strongly evaporated and quickly\r\ncooled whilst stirring. The crystals of cobalt nitrate and chloride\r\nabsorb moisture from the air and deliquesce; they must be kept in glass\r\nvessels with well-ground stoppers.\r\n\r\nThe cobalt compounds which are to be used in colour making must be free\r\nfrom iron, nickel and arsenic, which would detract from the cleanness\r\nof the colours. If the precipitate produced by soda contains iron it\r\nis mixed with excess of solution of oxalic acid, and after a few hours\r\nthe cobalt oxalate is filtered from the liquid, in which all the iron\r\nis dissolved. The cobalt oxalate can then be converted into nitrate or\r\nchloride by treatment with nitric or hydrochloric acids.\r\n\r\nThese salts form the material for the preparation of the cobalt\r\ncompounds, a large number of which are used as extremely durable red,\r\nblue and green pigments; several of them, such as cobalt blue, cannot\r\nbe exactly replaced by other pigments. On account of the industrial\r\nimportance of the cobalt colours, these directions for the preparation\r\nof the soluble cobalt salts from the ores have been given with some\r\ndetail. The preparation of the cobalt colours will be given _in\r\nextenso_ later on.\r\n\r\n=Chromium Compounds.=—As the name indicates, this metal yields numerous\r\ncoloured compounds (χρῶμα, colour); in fact, only coloured chromium\r\ncompounds are known, and the colours are most varied—yellow, green, red\r\nand violet. On this account the chromium compounds are among the most\r\nimportant used in colour making; a great number of colours are prepared\r\nby their aid. Chrome ironstone, as we have already stated, is the raw\r\nmaterial for the preparation of chromium compounds. From it potassium\r\nbichromate is made on a large scale in special works, so that no colour\r\nmaker is compelled to prepare chromium salts himself.\r\n\r\nWhen the chromium pigments contain no metal blackened by sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, they have the desirable property of being unaltered by the\r\natmosphere. Like the cobalt compounds, they are distinguished by their\r\ngreat stability when heated; on this account, they have a large use in\r\nporcelain painting.\r\n\r\n=Molybdenum, Tungsten and Vanadium Compounds= on account of their cost\r\nhave a very limited use as pigments. Molybdenum compounds are obtained\r\nfrom molybdic acid; compounds of tungsten from the metal; and those of\r\nvanadium from ammonium vanadate.\r\n\r\n=Antimony Compounds= can be used in the preparation of several\r\npigments, but, on account of their behaviour towards sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, the pigments cannot be regarded as really permanent, and\r\ntheir use is generally diminishing. The so-called antimony vermilion is\r\nthe only antimony compound at all extensively employed.\r\n\r\n=Bismuth Compounds= possess properties very similar to those of\r\nantimony. Only one bismuth preparation is used as a pigment, and this\r\nis very sensitive to the action of sulphuretted hydrogen, being changed\r\ninto black bismuth sulphide.\r\n\r\n=Tin Compounds= are employed in two ways: some are themselves colours,\r\nsuch as stannic sulphide (mosaic gold); others, themselves colourless,\r\nare used in making pigments, as stannous and stannic chlorides.\r\n\r\nStannous Chloride, SnCl₂.2 H₂O, is obtained when tin is dissolved in\r\nhydrochloric acid, hydrogen being evolved. Stannic Chloride, SnCl₄, is\r\nformed when tin is dissolved in a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric\r\nacids (_aqua regia_).\r\n\r\nTin compounds have, similarly to aluminium salts, the property of\r\nforming coloured insoluble compounds (lakes) with many organic\r\ncolouring matters. Their use for this purpose is extensive.\r\n\r\n=Arsenic Compounds= formerly played an important part in colour making.\r\nThey were used in the manufacture of a large number of pigments,\r\nvery beautiful but extremely poisonous. At the present time, we can,\r\nfortunately, entirely dispense with arsenic in colour making; the\r\narsenic colours can be replaced by others equally handsome and less,\r\nor not at all poisonous. The most important of the arsenic compounds\r\nis the trioxide As₂O₃, or Arsenious Acid, commercially known as white\r\narsenic. This substance is obtained in large quantities as a by-product\r\nin the extraction of several metals. It forms masses which are either\r\nglassy or have the appearance of porcelain. Freshly sublimed arsenic\r\ntrioxide is glassy; this form gradually changes into the porcellaneous\r\nvariety, it dissolves with difficulty in water. A strong solution can\r\nonly be obtained by boiling for many hours.\r\n\r\nThe compounds of arsenic with sulphur, formerly extensively used as\r\npigments, have now almost fallen into disuse.\r\n\r\n=Lead Compounds= belong to the substances most largely used in making\r\ncolours. Unfortunately all lead colours have two very important\r\ndrawbacks. They are all very poisonous and at the same time extremely\r\nsensitive to sulphuretted hydrogen, so that they are very considerably\r\naltered by the action of the small quantities of that gas contained in\r\nthe atmosphere of an ordinary dwelling. A striking example of this is\r\nseen in the lead paints used on the doors of water-closets. The paint,\r\nat first pure white, becomes gradually darker, and at last almost\r\nblack, the lead compound having been changed into black lead sulphide.\r\n\r\nOn account of this great sensitiveness of lead compounds, it would\r\nbe better if they could be excluded from the list of colours. Great\r\ncare must be taken not to mix lead compounds with others which contain\r\nsulphur; a discolouration of the mixture would be the inevitable result\r\nin a very short time.\r\n\r\nThe oxides of lead and a number of its salts are themselves pigments,\r\nfor example, litharge, PbO, red lead, Pb₃O₄, and white lead (basic lead\r\ncarbonate). These pigments are prepared on a large scale in particular\r\nworks. At this point only those lead compounds will be mentioned which\r\nare generally used for the preparation of other lead pigments; they\r\nare: lead sulphate, nitrate, acetate and chloride.\r\n\r\n=Lead Sulphate=, PbSO₄, is formed when sulphuric acid or the solution\r\nof a sulphate is added to the solution of a lead salt; so obtained it\r\nis a white crystalline powder insoluble in water. This substance is\r\ngenerally not made in colour works, but is purchased from chemical\r\nworks or dye houses, of which it is a by-product. In this form\r\n(lead bottoms) it is generally not sufficiently pure, but contains\r\nadmixtures of sulphuric acid or aluminium salts, from which it is\r\nfreed by washing. The lead sulphate is stirred up in water, the heavy\r\nprecipitate allowed to settle, the wash water drawn off, and after\r\nrepeating this process until the wash water no longer shows an acid\r\nreaction, the purified precipitate is dried. In this condition it is a\r\nheavy, white powder, and can alone be ground into paint. But on account\r\nof its crystalline nature, which reduces the covering power, such use\r\nis inadvisable.\r\n\r\n=Lead Nitrate=, Pb(NO₃)₂.—This very important compound may be bought,\r\nbut it is advisable to prepare it in the works. Water is placed in a\r\nwooden tub, then half the volume of nitric acid is added, and finely\r\npowdered litharge gradually stirred in, the liquid being kept in\r\nconstant movement. When it is seen that the litharge is only slowly\r\ndissolved, the liquid is well stirred after each addition of litharge\r\nand then tested by litmus paper. When this is no longer reddened, the\r\nnitric acid is completely saturated, and the liquid contains only\r\nlead nitrate in solution. It is allowed to stand until the insoluble\r\nportions have settled, and then drawn off into another vessel where\r\ncrystals of lead nitrate separate in a few days. If the salt be\r\nrequired in solid form, the solution may be evaporated in earthenware\r\ndishes; generally the solution is used as it is obtained.\r\n\r\nPure lead nitrate forms white crystals which are not particularly\r\nsoluble in water, 1 part requiring 2 parts of water at the ordinary\r\ntemperature. Lead nitrate is decomposed on heating, like all nitrates,\r\nand litharge remains. The solution of this salt is used in the\r\npreparation of those lead pigments which are obtained by precipitation,\r\nfor example, chrome yellow.\r\n\r\n=Lead Acetate=, Pb(C₂H₃O₂)₂.3H₂O.—The compounds of lead with acetic\r\nacid are of great importance. Two of these are to be considered:\r\nneutral lead acetate, commonly known as sugar of lead, and basic lead\r\nacetate. It may be advisable to manufacture both these compounds, the\r\nlatter always. Neutral lead acetate comes into commerce in the form of\r\ncolourless heavy crystals, which are often covered by a white powder\r\nof the basic acetate; they dissolve readily in water, and the solution\r\nhas a sweetish taste, hence the name “sugar of lead”. Frequently the\r\nsolution is very turbid; this is caused by the carbonates contained in\r\nthe water. The turbidity may be removed by the addition of a little\r\nacetic acid. It is only economical for the colour maker to prepare\r\nsugar of lead when he can obtain cheap raw materials, lead or litharge\r\nand vinegar. Pyroligneous acid may also be used if it is colourless,\r\nits odour being without importance for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe best method for preparing lead acetate from litharge is to place\r\nthe vinegar in a tub and hang in it a strong linen bag filled with\r\nfinely ground litharge. The tub is kept covered for a few days and its\r\ncontents then tested with red litmus paper. When this is turned blue,\r\nthe liquid is drawn off and vinegar gradually added whilst stirring,\r\nuntil blue litmus paper is just turned red. In this process, after\r\nneutral lead acetate has been formed, more lead oxide is dissolved, and\r\nthe liquid thus acquires an alkaline reaction. The further addition of\r\nacetic acid reconverts the basic salt into neutral lead acetate.\r\n\r\nLead acetate solution may, with advantage, be prepared directly from\r\nmetallic lead. For this purpose, lead is granulated by melting and\r\npouring in a thin stream into cold water, where it solidifies in\r\nirregular pieces. This is done in order to give the lead as large a\r\nsurface as possible. Three high narrow tubs placed one above the other\r\nso that liquid may flow from the highest to the middle, and from this\r\ninto the lowest, are filled with granulated lead. Vinegar is placed\r\nin the uppermost vessel to cover the lead; after twenty-four hours it\r\nis allowed to flow into the middle, and after a further twenty-four\r\nhours into the lowest tub. In this way, a solution of basic lead\r\nacetate is formed, to which the necessary quantity of acetic acid is\r\nadded to bring it into the neutral condition. If crystalline lead\r\nacetate is required, the liquid is evaporated down and quickly cooled\r\nwith stirring, so that small crystals are formed. Generally, however,\r\nevaporation is unnecessary, since lead acetate is always used in\r\nsolution in preparing colours.\r\n\r\nIf the lead acetate solution be not colourless, which is generally\r\nthe case when coloured acetic acid is used, the defect may be removed\r\nby stirring a little bone black into the liquid and filtering after\r\ntwenty-four hours, when a completely colourless solution is obtained.\r\n\r\nIt is always necessary to know exactly how much lead acetate is\r\ncontained in the solutions prepared by these processes. The lead or\r\nthe litharge is therefore weighed and the volume of the lead acetate\r\nsolution measured. One hundred parts by weight of crystallised lead\r\nacetate are obtained from 62·54 parts of lead.\r\n\r\nLead acetate solutions must be kept in well-covered vessels. The\r\ncarbonic acid of the air will turn the liquid turbid. The turbidity may\r\nbe removed by the addition of acetic acid.\r\n\r\nIn the following table is given the percentage of crystallised lead\r\nacetate contained in solutions of different specific gravities:—\r\n\r\n    +--------+------------+--------+------------+\r\n    |Specific|Crystallised|Specific|Crystallised|\r\n    |Gravity.|Lead Acetate|Gravity.|Lead Acetate|\r\n    |        |  per cent. |        |  per cent. |\r\n    +--------+------------+--------+------------+\r\n    | 1·0000 |      0     | 1·1869 |     26     |\r\n    | 1·0064 |      1     | 1·1955 |     27     |\r\n    | 1·0127 |      2     | 1·2040 |     28     |\r\n    | 1·0191 |      3     | 1·2126 |     29     |\r\n    | 1·0255 |      4     | 1·2211 |     30     |\r\n    | 1·0319 |      5     | 1·2303 |     31     |\r\n    | 1·0386 |      6     | 1·2395 |     32     |\r\n    | 1·0453 |      7     | 1·2486 |     33     |\r\n    | 1·0520 |      8     | 1·2578 |     34     |\r\n    | 1·0587 |      9     | 1·2669 |     35     |\r\n    | 1·0654 |     10     | 1·2768 |     36     |\r\n    | 1·0725 |     11     | 1·2867 |     37     |\r\n    | 1·0796 |     12     | 1·2966 |     38     |\r\n    | 1·0867 |     13     | 1·3064 |     39     |\r\n    | 1·0939 |     14     | 1·3163 |     40     |\r\n    | 1·1010 |     15     | 1·3269 |     41     |\r\n    | 1·1084 |     16     | 1·3376 |     42     |\r\n    | 1·1159 |     17     | 1·3482 |     43     |\r\n    | 1·1234 |     18     | 1·3588 |     44     |\r\n    | 1·1309 |     19     | 1·3695 |     45     |\r\n    | 1·1384 |     20     | 1·3810 |     46     |\r\n    | 1·1464 |     21     | 1·3925 |     47     |\r\n    | 1·1544 |     22     | 1·4041 |     48     |\r\n    | 1·1624 |     23     | 1·4156 |     49     |\r\n    | 1·1704 |     24     | 1·4271 |     50     |\r\n    | 1·1784 |     25     |   ——   |     ——     |\r\n    +--------+------------+--------+------------+\r\n\r\n=Basic Lead Acetate=, Pb(C₂H₃O₂)₂.2PbO.—This salt may be regarded as\r\na compound of neutral lead acetate with lead oxide. It is obtained\r\nby digesting vinegar with excess of litharge or with metallic lead,\r\nand also by treating lead acetate solution with litharge so long as\r\nthe latter is dissolved. In the method last given, 100 parts of sugar\r\nof lead require about 118 parts of litharge to produce a saturated\r\nsolution of basic acetate. The solution of this compound is alkaline;\r\nit turns red litmus paper blue. When exposed to the air, a turbidity\r\nis quickly produced owing to the separation of lead carbonate. In one\r\nwhite lead process basic lead acetate is the starting point of the\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\n=Lead Chloride=, PbCl₂, is seldom used in making colours. It may\r\nbe prepared by stirring powdered litharge in common salt solution\r\nuntil the powder appears white. This, when washed, constitutes basic\r\nlead chloride. On adding hydrochloric acid to the washed mass until\r\nthe liquid remains acid, lead chloride is obtained in the form of\r\ncrystalline needles, which are very little soluble in cold, but more\r\neasily in hot, water.\r\n\r\nLike any other soluble lead salt, lead chloride may be used in the\r\nprecipitation of colours, but is seldom employed on account of its\r\nsmall solubility. Basic lead chloride was, at one time, used as a white\r\npigment, and after melting, by which it is turned yellow, as a yellow\r\npigment; it is no longer in use for these purposes.\r\n\r\n=Copper Compounds.=—These are generally green or blue, and have an\r\nextended use in the production of colours. The metallic copper which\r\nis used in the preparation of colours is of the ordinary commercial\r\nquality. The impurities which it contains are generally so small in\r\nquantity that they are without importance for our purpose.\r\n\r\n=Copper Sulphate= (Bluestone, Blue Vitriol), CuSO₄.5H₂O.—This is the\r\ncommonest of the commercial copper salts, and on that account deserves\r\nour especial attention. It forms large sky-blue crystals, which\r\neffloresce slightly in the air, possess an unpleasant metallic taste,\r\nand are poisonous, like all soluble copper compounds.\r\n\r\nCopper sulphate comes into commerce in a very pure form, but some\r\nqualities contain zinc sulphate or ferrous sulphate. The presence of\r\nzinc may be detected most easily by boiling the solution with excess\r\nof caustic soda, when copper oxide separates as a black powder, whilst\r\nzinc oxide remains dissolved. When sulphuretted hydrogen is passed\r\nthrough the liquid, a white precipitate of zinc sulphide is formed.\r\n\r\nIron is detected by passing sulphuretted hydrogen through the solution\r\nso long as a precipitate is formed, allowing the liquid to stand in\r\na covered vessel, pouring it off from the precipitate, adding nitric\r\nacid, boiling and adding a solution of potassium ferrocyanide; a blue\r\nprecipitate denotes the presence of iron.\r\n\r\nCopper sulphate is rarely found which is quite free from iron and zinc.\r\nIf these impurities are present in but small quantity, the zinc not\r\nexceeding 1 per cent. and the iron at most 0·5 per cent., the copper\r\nsulphate may be regarded as sufficiently pure for our purposes.\r\n\r\nIt may be here remarked that copper sulphate obtained from mints is\r\ngenerally of great purity, and hence particularly adapted for colour\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nWhen copper sulphate and other copper salts are dissolved in water,\r\npale blue flocks of copper carbonate generally separate. This is due\r\nto the carbonate of lime contained in the water. An addition of a few\r\ndrops of sulphuric, nitric or hydrochloric acid suffices to prevent\r\nthis separation.\r\n\r\n=Copper Nitrate=, Cu(NO₃)₂.6H₂O.—This salt may occasionally be\r\nobtained in colour works as a by-product. When nitric acid is poured\r\nover copper, there follows a copious evolution of nitric oxide, which\r\nproduces brown fumes of nitrogen peroxide in air. Nitric oxide may be\r\nused to convert ferrous into ferric salts, a transformation required\r\nin making Prussian blue. In working in this way, nitric acid is poured\r\nover copper contained in a vessel provided with a delivery tube for the\r\ngas. The blue solution is at once used. Pure copper nitrate forms fine\r\nblue crystals, which very readily deliquesce in the air. The solution\r\nis therefore generally used as it is prepared.\r\n\r\n=Copper Acetate=, Cu(C₂H₃O₂)₂.H₂O.—Copper is readily attacked by acetic\r\nacid. A number of salts are formed, of which some are used as pigments.\r\nFor our purpose it will be sufficient to describe the manufacture of\r\nverdigris; few colour makers prepare any other copper acetate. A\r\nsolution of this salt is most simply prepared in the following manner:\r\nSlaked lime is stirred with strong vinegar, and the solution left in\r\ncontact with the excess of lime so long as it has a weak acid reaction.\r\nThe solution, which contains acetate of lime, is poured into a solution\r\nof copper sulphate so long as a precipitate of sulphate of lime is\r\nformed. When this has been separated from the liquid, the latter is\r\nready for further treatment. It contains only a very small quantity of\r\ndissolved sulphate of lime, which is not harmful in the preparation of\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the copper compounds mentioned here, several others were\r\nformerly used as pigments, or in the preparation of pigments which are\r\nno longer employed, because copper compounds of good colour can be\r\nobtained in a cheaper manner.\r\n\r\nThe same precautions should be taken in the use of copper colours\r\nwhich were mentioned for lead pigments; copper compounds are equally\r\nsensitive towards sulphuretted hydrogen, by which they are gradually\r\ndiscoloured.\r\n\r\n=Mercury Compounds.=—Mercury forms compounds which, vermilion in\r\nparticular, are used as pigments, and others which are used in the\r\npreparation of pigments. In many cases metallic mercury is the starting\r\npoint in the preparation of the mercury compounds. The compounds\r\ncommonly known as calomel and corrosive sublimate are also used.\r\n\r\n=Mercurous Nitrate=, HgNO₃.—Nitric acid acts upon mercury in a manner\r\ndiffering according to its strength, and according to whether the\r\nmercury or the nitric acid is used in excess. In order to prepare\r\nmercurous nitrate, acid free from chlorine must be diluted at least\r\nwith four times its volume of water, and the mercury must be in excess.\r\nOn warming, the mercury is gradually dissolved, and, on cooling,\r\nthe solution deposits colourless crystalline needles of the salt. A\r\nfurther crop of crystals is obtained after evaporating the solution.\r\n\r\nWhen the action of nitric acid is over, the solution must be at once\r\nseparated from the excess of mercury to prevent the formation of basic\r\nsalts. If the salt has been properly made, it is completely soluble in\r\nwater, but if a lemon yellow precipitate is formed on dissolving, the\r\nnitrate contains a basic salt, which can only be dissolved by warming\r\nand adding more nitric acid.\r\n\r\n=Mercuric Nitrate=, Hg(NO₃)₂, is most simply obtained by warming\r\nmercury with very strong nitric acid. The heating must be continued\r\nuntil a test portion of the solution no longer gives a precipitate with\r\nhydrochloric acid. When this solution is evaporated, nitric acid is\r\ngiven off, and a salt crystallising in white needles is obtained, which\r\ndissolves in water with the separation of a yellow basic salt. It is\r\ntherefore better to use the hot solution, which contains a little free\r\nacid, without evaporating.\r\n\r\nInstead of mercurous and mercuric nitrates, the corresponding sulphates\r\nmay be used, but the chlorides are more frequently employed since they\r\ncan be readily obtained from the makers.\r\n\r\n=Mercurous Chloride= (Calomel), HgCl, is obtained pure by adding common\r\nsalt solution to a solution of mercurous nitrate and washing the\r\nprecipitate, which is insoluble in water.\r\n\r\n=Mercuric Chloride= (Corrosive Sublimate), HgCl₂ a common article of\r\ncommerce, is prepared by heating a carefully made mixture of mercuric\r\nsulphate and common salt, when mercuric chloride sublimes. It is a\r\nwhite crystalline mass, soluble in 13·5 parts of water at 20° C., and\r\nsoluble in 3 parts of alcohol. Although all mercury compounds are very\r\npoisonous, corrosive sublimate requires particular care in handling,\r\nsince its easy solubility makes it surpass all other mercury compounds\r\nin poisonousness.\r\n\r\nThe mercuric sulphate required in the above preparation is obtained by\r\nheating mercury with sulphuric acid. Corrosive sublimate can also be\r\nprepared by adding hydrochloric acid to mercurous nitrate, and heating,\r\nwith gradual addition of hydrochloric acid until a clear solution is\r\nformed, from which mercuric chloride crystallises on cooling.\r\n\r\n=Silver Compounds.=—Silver nitrate, AgNO₃, is the only one of\r\nimportance here. It is obtained by dissolving silver in nitric acid,\r\nwhen a blue solution is obtained because commercial silver contains\r\ncopper, evaporating the solution to dryness, melting the residue, and\r\nkeeping it molten until all the copper nitrate is decomposed. This\r\npoint is recognised when a small portion of the melt dissolved in water\r\ndoes not give a blue colouration with excess of ammonia. Fused silver\r\nnitrate forms a white crystalline mass readily soluble in water and\r\nturning black when exposed to light, like many other silver compounds.\r\n\r\n=Gold Compounds.=—Gold is now very little used in preparing colours.\r\nThe compound used for this purpose is gold chloride, AuCl₃, which is\r\nobtained by heating gold with hydrochloric acid, and adding nitric\r\nacid in small quantities until all the metal is dissolved. By careful\r\nevaporation of the yellow solution gold chloride is obtained in\r\nbrownish yellow crystals, which easily dissolve in water.\r\n\r\nThe compounds of molybdenum, vanadium and uranium are less used than\r\nthose of gold, yet these metals find a special use in the preparation\r\nof colours for porcelain painting and for colouring glass, for which\r\nthey are of great importance. The preparation of their compounds from\r\nthe raw materials is complicated and not remunerative to the colour\r\nmaker; they should be obtained from chemical works.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing, the most important compounds of inorganic origin\r\nused in making colours have been briefly described, less in order to\r\nteach the methods for their preparation than to give the manufacturer\r\nthe means of learning their properties. Since the great development of\r\nchemical industries during the last decades it is more advantageous for\r\nthe colour maker in most cases to draw his supply of these substances\r\nfrom works of good reputation than to make them himself; only in the\r\ncase of a few substances, which are sold at unreasonably high prices,\r\nwill it be profitable for him to prepare them himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF MINERAL PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy mineral pigments we understand those which consist of compounds of\r\nmetals with elements such as sulphur, chlorine and iodine, or with\r\ncompound radicals, such as cyanogen, or of metallic salts.\r\n\r\nLooking at the classification of mineral pigments from the chemical\r\nstandpoint, a grouping according to the constituents would appear\r\npreferable, and we should have groups of colours consisting of metallic\r\noxides, sulphides, salts, etc. In such a division of pigments,\r\naccording to their constituents, no regard would be taken of the colour\r\nof the pigment. The white zinc oxide would be placed in the same group\r\nwith yellow lead oxide and red lead oxide; and red mercury sulphide and\r\nyellow cadmium sulphide would fall into the same group of the sulphur\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of a pigment is of less importance to the\r\ncolour manufacturer than its shade, and it therefore appears to us\r\nmore reasonable to prefer to classify mineral pigments according to\r\nsimilarity of colour. We shall therefore place all those mineral\r\npigments together which possess the same colour.\r\n\r\nCommon usage differs from the scientific in the description of colours.\r\nIn the physical sense, yellow, red and blue are the so-called “simple\r\ncolours,” between which lie orange, green and violet as “mixed\r\ncolours”. Physics knows no white colour and no black colour, but\r\ndescribes white as a mixture of all the simple colours and black as\r\nthe absence of colour. A grey or brown shade, produced by different\r\nmixtures of simple colours, is just as little known in the scale of\r\ncolours as white or black.\r\n\r\nThe colour maker follows, as we have said above, the common manner of\r\nspeaking; to him white and black are equally as much colours as red\r\nand green. Besides the pure principal colours (yellow, red and blue),\r\nand the mixed colours obtained from them (orange, green and violet),\r\ncolour makers distinguish many shades of each colour—lemon yellow,\r\nsulphur yellow, cherry red, blood red, violet blue, etc. For the\r\npresent purpose it is of great importance to accurately distinguish\r\nthe several shades, for the value of many colours is in proportion to\r\ntheir beauty of shade. The colour maker is often required to produce a\r\ncolour of some particular shade, which he accomplishes in many cases by\r\na suitable alteration in the process by which the colour is made, in\r\nother cases by mixing different colours, in which event chemistry is\r\nof no help to him; he must depend on the sensitiveness of his eyes to\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n=White Mineral Pigments.=—We are acquainted with a great number of\r\nwhite or, more properly, colourless mineral compounds; they possess the\r\nproperty of reflecting, undecomposed, all the rays of light which fall\r\nupon them, in consequence of which they produce that impression upon\r\nthe eye which we call white. According as a white substance reflects\r\nevery ray of light or absorbs a portion, we see it as a brilliant pure\r\nwhite or, in the latter case, as a white with a grey tinge. If a white\r\nbody reflects the majority of the rays of light falling on it, but\r\ndecomposes a small number, we perceive a white which has a yellow, blue\r\nor red tinge.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable white for the colour maker is evidently that which\r\nreflects, unaltered, all the rays of light; it is the most brilliant,\r\nand free from every tinge of colour. The physical condition of the\r\nsubstance is most important. Solid substances are either crystalline,\r\nthat is, possess definite shapes formed according to a regular law,\r\nor they are amorphous, that is, are composed of irregularly formed\r\nparticles. Snow and white lead may serve as representatives of these\r\ntwo classes. Snow is composed of small colourless crystals of ice, the\r\nflat surfaces of which reflect, undecomposed, the light falling on\r\nthem. The smaller are the crystals, the more pure appears to us the\r\nwhiteness of the snow, and the thinner is the layer of snow required\r\nto produce the sensation of whiteness. But if the snow crystals are\r\nlarger, the white appears to have a bluish tinge, and only a thick\r\nlayer of snow is opaque. White lead, being an amorphous substance in a\r\ncondition of very fine division, reflects the light very regularly, so\r\nthat a thin layer of white lead appears quite opaque.\r\n\r\nAmong the artificial pigments, crystalline or amorphous, exactly the\r\nsame conditions hold good as between snow and white lead. Of amorphous\r\npigments a very thin layer is in most cases sufficient to make the\r\nsurface upon which they are spread invisible, or, as the technical\r\nexpression runs, “to cover,” whilst crystalline substances possess\r\na smaller covering power. A striking example of this is seen by a\r\ncomparison of two white pigments, white lead and “patent white” (lead\r\noxychloride). The former is amorphous, the latter crystalline. Both are\r\ncompletely colourless and reflect white light, but in consequence of\r\nits amorphous condition and finer particles, white lead possesses far\r\ngreater covering power than “patent white”.\r\n\r\nAmong all other colours the same rule holds. Amorphous pigments have\r\nalways a greater covering power than crystalline. The smaller the\r\ncrystals of the latter the greater is their covering power, so that in\r\npreparing pigments of a crystalline character care must be taken to\r\nmake the crystals as small as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom the above definition of white pigments it follows that an immense\r\nnumber must exist, since every colourless substance in a state of fine\r\ndivision appears white. Generally only those bodies are used which\r\nare insoluble in water, or almost insoluble, and which possess great\r\ncovering power. The following may be mentioned as white pigments, only\r\na few of which are in use: white lead, white zinc, permanent white,\r\nlead oxychloride, lead sulphate and sulphite, zinc oxychloride, lead\r\nantimoniate, antimony white, tin white, tungsten white, and in addition\r\ncertain earths, pipe clay, china clay, etc. Several of these pigments\r\nare far too expensive for ordinary use, and have no advantage over much\r\ncheaper pigments except for very special purposes, such, for example,\r\nas bismuth white for cosmetics.\r\n\r\nIn general use we find very few artificial white pigments; these are\r\nlead, zinc and barium compounds. Circumstances may arise which make it\r\nexpedient for the colour maker to manufacture other white pigments, for\r\nexample, a demand for them, or favourable opportunities for obtaining\r\nthe requisite raw materials.\r\n\r\nThe white lead pigments, of which there is a large number, as we have\r\nindicated, all have the great disadvantage that they are not permanent,\r\nthat is, are changed by atmospheric influences. It is well known that\r\nlead is a very delicate reagent for sulphuretted hydrogen, with the\r\nsulphur of which it forms a black compound. Now the air, especially\r\nin towns, contains sulphur in the form of sulphuretted hydrogen or\r\nammonium sulphide; though the quantity is very small, the fate of\r\nevery white or coloured lead pigment is decided by it; after a longer\r\nor shorter time it will be discoloured, will gradually darken, and\r\nfinally be turned black. In spite of this great changeableness of lead\r\npigments they are used by artists and painters, although the majority\r\ncould be replaced by more permanent pigments entirely unaltered by the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE LEAD.\r\n\r\nThis pigment, which in addition to other good properties has remarkable\r\ncovering power, was amongst the earliest known artificial pigments.\r\nAlready in the fourth century before Christ, Dioscorides described the\r\npreparation of white lead, which was obtained by exposing lead to the\r\naction of the vapours of vinegar, removing the white layer and treating\r\nit with water. The Roman writers describe a similar method; they use\r\nthe name _cerussa_, under which white lead is known to-day in commerce.\r\n\r\nAlthough white lead has been so long known, it was left to Bergmann,\r\nin 1774, to show that it contained carbonic acid; before that it was\r\nbelieved to be lead acetate. The development of analytical chemistry\r\nwas followed by a knowledge of its constitution and the use of more\r\nrational methods of manufacture. Whilst in the middle ages the\r\nmanufacture of white lead was almost exclusively in the hands of the\r\nDutch and Venetians, in later years it gradually spread, and now\r\nmany works are concerned in the manufacture of this pigment. That\r\nadulterations of white lead were not rare in former times appears from\r\nthe writings of Basil Valentine, an alchemist of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nCommercially white lead is known under most varied titles, of which the\r\nfollowing are the principal: White lead, Venetian white, Dutch white,\r\nKrems white, Kremnitz white, flake white, etc.\r\n\r\nAccording to its chemical composition, white lead is a compound of\r\nlead carbonate and lead hydroxide, that is, a basic lead carbonate.\r\nCommercial white lead, apart from intentional admixtures of other white\r\nsubstances, contains lead carbonate and lead hydroxide in varying\r\nproportions, as is shown by the following analyses by Mulder, who found\r\nthat all the samples examined by him were composed according to one or\r\nother of the following formulæ:—\r\n\r\n    2 PbCO₃.Pb(OH)₂,  containing  86·27 per cent. of PbO.\r\n    5 PbCO₃.2Pb(OH)₂       ”      85·86    ”          ”\r\n    3 PbCO₃.Pb(OH)₂        ”      85·45    ”          ”\r\n    4 PbCO₃.Pb(OH)₂        ”      85·00    ”          ”\r\n\r\nAccording to Hochstetter, the manufacture of white lead must be\r\ndirected to obtaining the compound 2 PbCO₃.(OH)₂, which possesses the\r\nfollowing percentage composition:—\r\n\r\n    PbO     86·32\r\n    CO₂     11·36\r\n    H₂O      2·32\r\n\r\nThe compound of this composition is distinguished by being completely\r\namorphous, and so possesses the greatest covering power. Commercial\r\nwhite leads, as is seen from the formulæ of Mulder, may differ\r\nappreciably from this composition, when they will have a smaller\r\ncovering power, since they will contain some quantity of neutral\r\nlead carbonate, PbCO₃ (containing 83·46 per cent. of PbO), which is\r\ncrystalline.\r\n\r\nWhite lead is prepared according to very different methods, the\r\nprinciple of which consists in subjecting a solution of tribasic lead\r\nacetate to the action of carbonic acid, by which the basic carbonate\r\nis produced and the neutral acetate formed, the latter being then\r\nreconverted into the basic acetate, which again serves to produce white\r\nlead and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF WHITE LEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe processes by which white lead is or was manufactured may be\r\ndivided, according to the principal operations, in the following\r\nmanner:—\r\n\r\n1. Processes in which metallic lead is subjected to the action of\r\nacetic acid vapour, whilst the vessel in which this operation is\r\nconducted is exposed to a higher temperature. In the oldest so-called\r\nDutch method this increase of temperature is effected by the\r\ndecomposition of manure, by which the vessels containing the lead and\r\nacetic acid are surrounded. In consequence of the heat produced by this\r\nfermentation, acetic acid and water are volatilised, and oxygen also\r\nbeing present, lead acetate is formed.\r\n\r\nAlso, as a consequence of the oxidation of the lead, heat is produced,\r\nwhich accelerates the process, and lead oxide is formed in large\r\nquantity, which unites with the neutral acetate already formed to\r\nproduce a basic compound. The vessels in which this process is taking\r\nplace are in an atmosphere containing much carbonic acid produced by\r\nthe fermentation of the surrounding organic matter; this carbonic acid\r\nconverts the basic lead acetate into white lead.\r\n\r\nThe German or Austrian method is to be regarded as an improvement on\r\nthis rough process. The heat necessary for the normal course of the\r\nchemical reactions is produced from fuel; the carbonic acid formed by\r\nthe combustion of the fuel is used to convert the basic lead acetate\r\ninto white lead.\r\n\r\n2. In the above methods the manufacture of white lead commences with\r\nthe production of white lead from metallic lead and acetic acid. In the\r\nso-called French method a solution of basic lead acetate is decomposed\r\nby carbonic acid into white lead and neutral lead acetate, which latter\r\nis again converted into basic acetate.\r\n\r\n3. The English method. The principle of this process consists in\r\nmoistening litharge with a solution of lead acetate and exposing it to\r\nthe action of carbonic acid, whereby white lead is formed.\r\n\r\nMethods for manufacturing white lead, which are often advanced as\r\nentirely new processes, may be always traced to one of the above, from\r\nwhich they deviate but little in principle, and the deviations cannot\r\nalways be regarded as improvements. In the following detailed account\r\nof the manufacture of white lead we shall adhere to the classification\r\njust given, according to which there are three principal methods: (1)\r\nManufacture of white lead from metallic lead, acetic acid and carbonic\r\nacid (Dutch and German processes); (2) manufacture of white lead from\r\nbasic lead acetate (French process); and (3) from litharge moistened\r\nwith lead acetate solution (English process).\r\n\r\nWe should remark that every year “new” processes for the manufacture of\r\nwhite lead are patented. The majority of these will not be mentioned;\r\nto those acquainted with the principles of chemistry they at once\r\nappear impracticable.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURE OF WHITE LEAD FROM METALLIC LEAD.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) DUTCH PROCESS.\r\n\r\nThis essentially primitive process, when properly conducted, produces\r\nwhite lead of good colour and covering power, which are the properties\r\nfor which this pigment is valued. It is now seldom used,[2] because\r\nother methods give a product of equal colour in a shorter time. It is,\r\nhowever, of economic interest, as showing how a branch of industry\r\nmay rise from crude beginnings to a high state of perfection. The\r\noperations comprised in the Dutch process are as follows:—\r\n\r\n[2] In England the Dutch process is in general use.—TRANSLATOR.\r\n\r\n(1) Casting the lead into sheets; (2) placing these sheets in pots and\r\narranging the pots in the stacks (placing the pots containing lead\r\nand acetic acid in the bed of manure); (3) removing the pots from the\r\nstack; (4) separating the white lead formed in the pots; (5) further\r\npurification of the impure white lead by grinding, washing and drying.\r\n\r\n1. =Casting the Lead into Sheets.=—At first sight it would appear\r\nunsuitable to cast lead in sheets, since this metal can be readily\r\nrolled into sheets of any thickness. Experience has, however, shown\r\nthat rolled lead is only slowly attacked by acetic acid vapours, whilst\r\ncast sheets are rapidly attacked.\r\n\r\nAn iron pan about one metre in diameter, with an iron cover furnished\r\nwith a pipe opening into a flue, is used for melting the lead. This\r\narrangement is designed to protect the workman from the dangerous\r\nvapours evolved from the molten metal. At the workman’s side of this\r\ncover is a counterpoised slide, which only remains open when the\r\ncounterpoise is held in check by a lever. In front of the kettle\r\nthere is an iron plate movable about a horizontal axis. The lead\r\nbeing heated to just above its melting point, the workman takes 7 to\r\n8 kilogrammes of metal in a ladle, and pours it on the plate, which\r\nis horizontal. The lead solidifies in a very short time, but before\r\nit is completely solid the plate is inclined towards the pan so that\r\nthe still liquid lead runs back into it, leaving a very thin sheet on\r\nthe plate. The hard sheet is removed from the plate, and the latter\r\ncooled by cold water to be ready for a new casting. The sheets made in\r\nthis way are not more than 1 to 2 millimetres thick. They are then cut\r\ninto strips of a width to suit the size of the pots in which they are\r\nconverted into white lead; the width of the sheets is generally 5 to 6\r\ncentimetres. Since the rate at which the white lead is formed depends\r\non the surface of the metallic lead, instead of continuous sheets the\r\nlead is generally cast into gratings. For this purpose an iron plate,\r\nupon which are intersecting strips, is used instead of the flat plate.\r\nPlates for the casting are also used containing grooves intersecting\r\nat right angles. In the first case, plates are obtained in which are\r\nopenings meeting at right angles, and in the second case, according to\r\nthe distance of the grooves apart, a more or less wide-meshed lattice\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.]\r\n\r\n2. =Building up the Stacks.=—The rolled-up lead plates are placed in\r\nthe pots. These (Fig. 4) are somewhat conical in shape; they have at\r\nsome distance from the bottom a projecting ring, or sometimes three\r\nprojections only, upon which the lead spiral rests. Before the spirals\r\nare put in position, a quantity of ordinary vinegar, about a quarter of\r\na litre, is poured in. There must be sufficient room below the spiral\r\nso that it shall not be in contact with the vinegar. The insides of\r\nthe pots are glazed at least half-way up, so that the liquid does not\r\npenetrate the porous earthenware.\r\n\r\nThe pots have a capacity of about 1 litre, and a diameter at the top\r\nof 10 centimetres. If lead plates are used, the pots are about 20\r\ncentimetres high; if gratings are used the pots may be lower, by which\r\nthere is economy in room and a larger number can be placed in one stack.\r\n\r\nThe stacks, built up of pots and manure, are of different sizes; it\r\nis not advisable to make them too small, or the loss of heat would\r\nbe considerable. A stack 4 to 5 metres long, 3½ metres wide and 6 to\r\n7 metres high will contain 6,000 to 8,000 pots and 9,000 to 11,000\r\nkilogrammes of lead.\r\n\r\nThe stack consists of a rectangular pit walled on three sides; the\r\nfourth side is open, with the earth dug out in the form of an inclined\r\nplane, in order to permit the introduction of the pots and the manure.\r\nThe construction of the stack is commenced by placing the pots at the\r\nbottom in rows, avoiding interspaces as much as possible. In a stack of\r\nthe size mentioned a layer contains 1,000 to 1,200 pots. Between the\r\npots containing lead and acetic acid are arranged a number of larger\r\nones containing acid only; the object of these is to furnish acetic\r\nacid vapour. When the pots are in place, 3 or 4 lead plates are placed\r\non each spiral, the top plate forming the cover; immediately over the\r\npots strong wooden planks are laid, and upon them a layer of boards,\r\nwhich must fit so tightly that nothing can fall through. On the boards\r\nis spread out a layer of fresh stable manure, with which the space\r\nbetween the outside row of pots and the wall is also filled. The layer\r\nof manure is 30 to 40 centimetres thick.\r\n\r\nUpon the lowest layer of pots, a second, third and so on are built up\r\nexactly in the same manner, so that the whole stack is filled with\r\nalternating layers of pots and manure. In order to prevent the cooling\r\nof the uppermost layer of pots, it is covered with a thicker layer of\r\nmanure 60 to 70 centimetres thick. When lead plates and the taller pots\r\nare used, a stack will generally contain 15 layers; but when gratings\r\nand the smaller pots are employed, 18 layers can be packed into the\r\nsame space. In arranging the layers of pots, care should be taken to\r\nleave spaces at tolerably equal distances, so that the air necessary\r\nfor the oxidation of the lead may enter. To prevent the cooling of the\r\nstack at the front, where it is not protected by masonry, when full it\r\nis walled up with boards; a board roof also protects the erection from\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nIn place of manure, spent tanners’ bark can be used, which in the\r\nsame manner ferments, producing heat and carbonic acid. In places in\r\nthe neighbourhood of large tanneries this spent bark is generally\r\nobtainable at lower prices than stable manure, which is more valuable\r\nfor agricultural purposes; the former has also a very considerable\r\nadvantage, white lead made by means of spent tanners’ bark being\r\ngenerally of a purer white than that made with manure. The reason for\r\nthis is that in the decomposition of animal excrement small quantities\r\nof sulphuretted hydrogen are produced, a gas which produces black lead\r\nsulphide when it comes into contact with lead compounds.\r\n\r\nAccording to the results of practical experience, pigs’ dung cannot be\r\nused in the manufacture of white lead; so much sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nis evolved from it that the white lead is not white, but has a greyish\r\ntinge.\r\n\r\nWhen bark is used in place of manure, a discolouration of white lead by\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen is not to be feared, but there is the drawback\r\nthat a longer time is necessary for the corrosion of the lead, because\r\nthe bark decomposes more slowly than the manure, and accordingly gives\r\nout less heat and carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nAccording to the climate of the country, the stacks may be differently\r\nerected. In colder countries it is necessary to sink them in the earth\r\nand surround them with masonry, as directed above; but in warmer\r\nclimates such effectual protection against cooling is unnecessary, yet\r\nin all cases it is better to sink the stack in the earth on account of\r\nthe regularity of temperature so obtained.\r\n\r\nInstead of sinking the stacks in the earth, they may be built in the\r\nopen when there is a plentiful supply of manure or bark; but they must\r\nthen be surrounded by a very thick layer of manure to prevent cooling.\r\nIt is a desirable alteration in the construction of the stacks to\r\nprovide the pots with lids, and so avoid the use of the layer of boards\r\nseparating each two layers of pots. The object of the cover is simply\r\nto prevent dirt from falling into the pot. It should not fit tightly on\r\nthe edge, or the entry of carbonic acid into the interior of the pot\r\nwould be made difficult. The lids are therefore rounded and fit loosely\r\non the pot. When pots with lids are used, the lowest layer is covered\r\nwith manure in the ordinary way; upon this again comes a layer of pots,\r\nand so on.\r\n\r\nThe transformation of the lead may be regarded as complete in four\r\nto six weeks when manure is used, but with bark the time extends to\r\nten weeks. The quantity of white lead obtained varies in different\r\ncases; for example, from a stack 5 metres long, 4 metres wide, and 6\r\nmetres high, into which 12,000 kilogrammes of lead were put, 10,000\r\nkilogrammes of white lead were obtained, and 4,000 kilogrammes of\r\nlead remained unaltered. In another case, for a stack of 8 layers 280\r\nkilogrammes of vinegar and 9,600 to 12,000 kilogrammes of lead were\r\nused, and there was a residue of 10 to 15 per cent. of lead.\r\n\r\n3. =Removal and Grinding of the White Lead.=—The stack is pulled down\r\nafter the lapse of the necessary time; the lead plates and rolls are\r\ncollected in wooden boxes and brought into the room where the white\r\nlead is separated from the metallic lead. Formerly the white lead was\r\nremoved from the sheets exclusively by manual labour, an operation\r\nextremely dangerous to the workman. It is quite impossible to prevent\r\nthe formation of white lead dust, so that the men were continuously\r\nin an atmosphere charged with the poisonous material, and, as a\r\nconsequence, suffered from the various forms of lead poisoning.\r\n\r\nIn order to diminish as much as possible the injurious effects of white\r\nlead on the health of the workmen, manual labour has been, as far as\r\npossible, replaced by machinery, yet the greatest care is necessary in\r\nthe different manipulations of so poisonous a substance as white lead.\r\n\r\nWhen the white lead is removed by manual labour, an operation which\r\nought to be forbidden, the lead sheets are unrolled and struck\r\ntogether, whereupon the greater part of the white lead falls off. To\r\nremove the remainder of the white lead the plates are laid one upon the\r\nother and struck with a hammer until the white lead is loosened; or the\r\nplates are cleaned with metal brushes.\r\n\r\nThe masses of white lead obtained in this way are contaminated by\r\nlarger or smaller quantities of metallic lead, from which they must\r\nbe freed by a further mechanical operation, namely grinding. The\r\nlarger pieces of the white lead, which have a thickness of several\r\nmillimetres, were picked out and sold separately under the name of\r\nflake white. This was formerly a highly prized quality of white lead,\r\nits appearance being a guarantee of its purity. The flake white\r\ngenerally found in the market nowadays is not obtained in this manner,\r\nbut by mixing white lead with a solution of dextrin, forming plates\r\nfrom the paste and drying them slowly in the air.\r\n\r\nIn order to separate the white lead mechanically from the remains of\r\nthe lead sheets, grooved rollers are used, between which the sheets are\r\npassed. In order to guard against dust, the rollers are surrounded by a\r\nclosed casing, in which there is also a sieve which serves to separate\r\nthe larger pieces of white lead (flake white) from the fine dust. The\r\narrangement is represented in Fig. 5. The unrolled plates pass through\r\nthe opening, B, on to an endless leather band, by means of which they\r\nare carried between the grooved rollers, D and E; after they have\r\npassed through these they go between a second pair of rollers, F and G,\r\nwhich are placed nearer together; they then fall into the drum-shaped\r\nsieve, H, out of which they leave the apparatus in the direction of K.\r\nThe white lead falls through the sieve, is caught in trucks placed at\r\nJ, and carried away to the mills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.]\r\n\r\nA mechanical arrangement for the separation of white lead from the\r\nunaltered metallic lead, due to Horn, is represented in Figs. 6 and\r\n7. It consists of a drum, in which is the spindle, _b_, provided with\r\nthe arms, _c_. The teeth, _e_, on the arms reach nearly to the lower\r\ncurve of the drum, but pass at a somewhat greater distance from the\r\nupper portion so that the pieces of lead can fall down again after\r\nthey are carried up. The material is fed in through the hopper, _t_,\r\nthe rotation of the arms loosens the white lead from the pieces of\r\nmetallic lead, and it is carried on by the water which passes through\r\nthe sieve, 3, and the stop cock, _h_, into the settling tank. The\r\nlead pieces which are carried forward have their progress checked by\r\nthe bridge, _o_, they are collected by the perforated scoop, _n_, are\r\nraised above the hopper, _m_, and fall out of the apparatus at _r_. If\r\nit is required to continue the treatment of the material in the drum\r\nfor a longer period it is only necessary to close the hopper, _m_, by\r\nthe slide, _n_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n_White Lead Mills._—Before the white lead is subjected to the real\r\nprocess of grinding, it is generally first ground dry, or, more\r\nproperly, pressed or crushed. This crushing is accomplished by means\r\nof vertical or edge-runner mills, which consist of mill-stones running\r\nround upon a stone bed about a vertical axis. The mill is surrounded by\r\na wooden casing to prevent the escape of dust.\r\n\r\nWet grinding, which is done between mill-stones, may be carried out in\r\ntwo ways, with the production of hard or soft white lead. The former is\r\nobtained when the lead acetate is not removed, the latter when all the\r\nlead acetate is washed out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n_Hard White Lead_ presents a shining mass, broken with difficulty. This\r\nappearance is a guarantee against adulteration with barytes; white\r\nlead, which contains this adulterant, does not give a smooth, but an\r\nuneven earthy fracture. Hard white lead is rather difficult to grind,\r\nand requires very careful treatment to be brought into that state of\r\nfine division in which it is usable.\r\n\r\nThe dry white lead, after powdering under the edge-runners, must pass\r\nthrough a sieve, which retains the particles of metallic lead, before\r\nit is subjected to wet grinding. The mills used for wet grinding differ\r\nlittle, or not at all, from the ordinary pattern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\nA mill designed by Richter of Königsee, in Thuringia, for wet grinding,\r\nis constructed as follows (Figs. 8 and 9). The shaft, _F E_, is driven\r\nby a water-wheel and the necessary gearing at 60 revolutions per\r\nminute; the bevelled cog-wheel _G_, by means of the cog-wheels _H_ and\r\n_J_, drives the shafts _K_ and _L_, which, by means of the bevelled\r\ncog-wheels _a_ and _b_, communicate to the runner stones of the mills,\r\n_M_, _N_ and _O_, a speed of 140 revolutions per minute. _C D_ is the\r\nframework for the support of the storied arrangement of mills, _f_ and\r\n_g_ are bearings with cast-iron cups to receive the escaping oil, _i_\r\nis a clamp fastening the axle _d_ to _k_. A steel cup in _k_ rests upon\r\nthe hardened top of the spindle, _l_; the bed stone rests upon the beam\r\n_n_ (80 millimetres thick) and is prevented from lateral movement by\r\nthe surrounding _oo_; _p_ is a wooden support in the opening in the bed\r\nstone, carrying the stuffing box, _q_, which prevents the white lead\r\nfrom running out, and connects the spindle, _l_, with the bed stone.\r\nThe runner stone, _r_, is surrounded by the box, _s_, cemented with\r\nwhite clay inside and out and fastened to the bed stone. The lever,\r\n_t_, turning about _w_, moved by the screw, _u_, and handle, _v_,\r\nregulates the position of the runner. The diameter of the stones is 95\r\ncentimetres.\r\n\r\nThirty kilogrammes of white lead, mixed with water, are fed into the\r\ntop mill of the series shown on the right; the mixture flows by the\r\nspouts, _e_, into the lower mills, and is received in vessels, from\r\nwhich it is emptied into the holder, _P_. From _P_ it goes through the\r\n3 mills on the left. After passing through 6 mills, white lead without\r\nbarytes is ready for use. If the white lead contains an admixture of\r\nbarytes, it is put through the 3 mills on the left a second time. In 24\r\nhours 900 to 1,200 kilogrammes (18 to 24 cwt.) of white lead are ground.\r\n\r\nIn dry grinding, mills are used arranged so that the formation of dust\r\nis avoided, a matter which is of particular importance. The usual\r\nsize of these mills has a diameter of 90 to 95 centimetres for both\r\nrunner and bed stone. The grinding surfaces of both stones have radial\r\ngrooves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nFig. 10 represents the construction of Lefèbre’s white lead mill, which\r\nis designed to give the greatest protection possible to the workmen. At\r\nA, the white lead masses are enclosed in a hopper lined with bronze,\r\nwith internal angular projections; by means of M, which is grooved in\r\na similar manner, the larger lumps are broken up and enter the mill\r\nitself by means of the hopper under A. The mill consists of bed stone,\r\nH, and runner, K. The grinding surfaces are grooved to facilitate the\r\ndelivery of the ground white lead. As the illustration shows, the\r\nstones are completely covered by M, so that the escape of dust is\r\nalmost completely prevented. The ground white lead is conducted by the\r\ntubes, O O, to the drums, O′ O′, from which it is packed.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain hard white lead, the material which has been ground\r\ndry under the edge-runners is mixed with water to a soft paste, or if\r\nwater has been added whilst the lead was under the edge stones, more\r\nis now added to make the paste thin enough to be ready for the mills,\r\nwhere it is ground, being fed in regularly by means of a copper spoon.\r\nThe paste issuing from the mill is collected in earthenware pans or\r\nplaster of Paris moulds, in which it is dried.\r\n\r\nThese pans have usually the shape of a truncated cone, which was the\r\nform in which white lead was formerly brought into trade from Holland.\r\nIn drying, water is lost, and the mass of white lead shrinks, so that\r\nthe lump can be removed from the mould after a few days on turning\r\nit upside down. The drying is accomplished either in the air or in\r\nartificially heated stoves. The heating must at first be gradual, or\r\nthe mass of white lead would shrink so rapidly that the cone would be\r\nfull of cracks, and then easily fall to pieces. When once the drying\r\nhas reached a certain stage, the temperature of the stove may be\r\nraised to 50° C. (122° F.) without danger of breaking the lumps. When\r\nquite dry, the surface of the white lead, which is now rough, must be\r\nsmoothed by scraping, when it is ready for the market.\r\n\r\n_Soft White Lead._—The hard white lead prepared as just described\r\nconsists of very heavy and very hard lumps of the purest white. When\r\nsoft white lead is required, the admixed lead acetate must be removed\r\nby washing. This is accomplished by adding a larger quantity of water,\r\neither when grinding under the edge-runners or in the mills, so that\r\na thin pulp is formed; this is run into a receiver, in which is a\r\nstirrer. The white lead is not completely prevented from sinking by the\r\nstirrer; a soft mud is deposited at the bottom of the vessel, which\r\ncan only be stirred up with difficulty on account of its high density.\r\nWhen this vessel is full, the stirrer is stopped and the milky liquid\r\nallowed to settle, which happens in a short time on account of the\r\nhigh specific gravity of white lead. The clear liquid above the white\r\nlead is drawn off into a tank lined with cement. It is advisable to\r\narrange the stirrer so that it may be placed at any height in the\r\nvessel; if this is the case, by gradually lowering the stirrer whilst\r\nin motion, the white lead lying at the bottom can be mixed up with\r\nfresh water. These operations are repeated until all the lead acetate\r\nis removed.\r\n\r\nSoda solution is added to the wash waters in order to recover the lead\r\ndissolved in them as lead acetate; lead carbonate is precipitated and\r\nsettles at the bottom of the tank. This precipitation may also be\r\neffected by putting lumps of limestone in the tank. The paste remaining\r\nin the washing tubs, which now contains only pure white lead and water,\r\nis filled into bags of closely woven material and the water pressed out\r\nby a gradually increasing pressure, until a stiff pulp remains behind.\r\nThis is then completely dried, either in the air or in drying stoves.\r\n\r\nSoft white lead forms either irregular lumps or a soft, heavy powder.\r\nThe lower qualities of white lead contain a smaller or larger quantity\r\nof finely ground barytes; the higher the proportion of barytes the\r\nsmaller is the covering power of the mixture. A very simple method for\r\ndetecting barytes in white lead will be given later.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) GERMAN PROCESS.\r\n\r\nThe German or Austrian method of making white lead is also known as the\r\nchamber process, since the formation takes place in closed chambers,\r\nconstructed of wood or masonry. In the older processes, cast lead\r\nsheets were bent double and hung on cross bars in a wooden box with\r\na water-tight bottom, with the precaution that the plates did not\r\ntouch. A number of these boxes, generally 90, were arranged in a hot\r\nroom, each box being about 1·6 metre long, 0·4 metre wide and 0·3\r\nmetre high. On the bottom of each box was poured a mixture of vinegar\r\nor dilute acetic acid and wine refuse, and the box was covered with\r\na well-fitting lid. The temperature of the room was gradually raised\r\nweek by week; during the first week remaining at 25° C., during the\r\nsecond at 38° C., the third at 45° C. At the commencement of the\r\nfourth week the temperature was raised to 50° C., at which it was kept\r\nfor a fortnight. At this high temperature a considerable quantity of\r\nacetic acid is evaporated, causing the formation of lead acetate,\r\nwhich is converted, by the carbonic acid evolved from the wine refuse,\r\ninto basic lead carbonate. When the proper temperatures have been\r\nmaintained, on opening the boxes almost all the lead is found changed\r\ninto white lead, which is knocked off, and the residual lead used in\r\ncasting new plates. It is easy to conceive that the boxes may be well\r\nreplaced by brick chambers, in which a large number of lead plates\r\nare brought and into which acetic acid vapours and carbonic acid are\r\nintroduced after the room has been closed. Chambers are used which can\r\ncontain 12,000 to 12,500 kilogrammes of lead.\r\n\r\nThese chambers, in which the lead plates are hung upon wooden supports,\r\nhave an opening immediately above the bottom, which is connected with\r\na retort in which vinegar, containing 4 to 5 per cent. of acetic acid,\r\nis boiled. After about 12 hours, by the simultaneous action of the\r\nvapours of acetic acid and the oxygen of the air, lead acetate is\r\nformed. Carbonic acid is now led into the chambers. The carbonic acid\r\nis obtained by burning charcoal in a cylindrical furnace; it is cooled\r\nby being passed through a long iron tube before it enters the chamber.\r\nFor 12,500 kilogrammes of lead there are required every day about 482\r\nlitres of dilute acetic acid, obtained by mixing strong acetic acid\r\nwith water until the mixture contains 4·5 per cent. of the acid, and\r\n18 kilogrammes of charcoal, from which the carbonic acid is obtained.\r\nThe time required is 5 or 6 weeks, and the residue of unaltered lead\r\nvaries from 10 to 35 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe white lead obtained by this process is quite usable, but the\r\nprocess has the considerable disadvantage that there is no control\r\nover the quantities of materials used. In order to produce a certain\r\nquantity of white lead of a certain composition, definite quantities\r\nof lead, oxygen, acetic acid and carbonic acid are necessary. If,\r\nthen, the apparatus can be so arranged that the quantities of material\r\nemployed can be accurately measured, a great advance will have been\r\nmade, for the operation will be no longer conducted at random, but\r\nunder definite unchangeable conditions. The quantities of carbonic acid\r\nand acetic acid can be calculated beforehand. The volumes of the gases\r\nrequired may be measured without difficulty by meters of the type used\r\nfor measuring coal gas. Upon this principle are based a number of more\r\nmodern methods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the process of Major, the vapours of water and acetic\r\nacid are introduced at the same time into the chambers filled with\r\nlead plates, in order to produce basic lead acetate. This part of the\r\nprocess requires about 12 hours. Then carbonic acid is introduced; it\r\nis produced by burning charcoal in an iron cylinder, through which air\r\nis forced. By means of this carbonic acid, which is at a comparatively\r\nhigh temperature, about 60° C., the lead acetate is quickly changed\r\ninto white lead. A portion of the lead acetate remains undecomposed;\r\nin order to remove this, at the close of the operation ammonia is\r\ninjected, which decomposes the lead salt. The ammonia salts now present\r\nare finally driven out by means of superheated steam. Major’s apparatus\r\nis depicted in Fig. 11. _A_ and _B_ are chambers with horizontal\r\ngratings upon which the lead lies; _C_ is the furnace for burning the\r\ncharcoal, provided with a fan. The products of combustion from _C_ pass\r\nunder the boiler _D_, their passage being regulated by the valve, _a_;\r\nthey then heat the boiler _E_, containing acetic acid, and enter the\r\nchambers, _A_ and _B_, through the flue, _b_, or are directed by the\r\nvalve in _b_ into the chimney, _d_. The gases, after passing through\r\nthe chamber, find an exit at _e_. The steam pipe, _f_, conducts steam\r\ninto the boiler _E_, through _g_, and also into the chambers, _A_ and\r\n_B_, thus heating them and providing the necessary moisture; _h_ is the\r\nfunnel for filling _E_; the pipe, _k_, carries the acetic acid vapours\r\ninto the chambers. After the thin lead plates have been brought into\r\nthe chambers they are closed and the temperature raised to 49° to 60°\r\nC., steam and acetic acid vapours are led in for 10 to 20 hours in\r\norder to form the basic acetate, then the furnace gases are introduced\r\nat a temperature of 60° C. The white lead obtained in this manner can\r\nbe finished in the ordinary way by washing and grinding, but it is\r\nbetter to remove the lead acetate by introducing ammonia, and then hot\r\nair or superheated steam, as previously stated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\nThe process is complete in 2 to 4 weeks. Gartner, working according to\r\nthis process with 150 kilogrammes of lead in a chamber 1·26 metre long,\r\n0·78 metre high and 0·78 metre wide, obtained good white lead in 28\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus designed by H. Kirberg for the manufacture of white lead\r\nis illustrated in Figs. 12, 13 and 14. The lead plates are hung upon\r\nthe laths, _a_, in the chambers; the supports of the laths, _b_, go\r\nthrough the slits, _c_, in the supports, _d_, and project through the\r\nwalls at _e_. The carriers, _b_, hang from bolts by brass wire. By\r\nstriking the end of the laths, _e_, they are made to swing so that the\r\nwhite lead loosely adhering to the lead plates is shaken off and fresh\r\nsurfaces of metal are exposed. The openings in the walls through which\r\nthe ends of the laths project are closed by indiarubber. In order to\r\nprevent the production of dust when the chambers are emptied, water is\r\nintroduced in a fine spray upon the lead plates from the copper tubes,\r\n_v_, placed under the roof of the chamber. The water washes off the\r\nremains of the white lead from the plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner, the white lead process may be carried out in a\r\nshorter time when the gases enter the chamber under increased pressure;\r\nbut this is attended with difficulties, since continuous supervision of\r\nthe apparatus and of the tightness of the chamber is necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus of W. Thompson (Fig. 15) consists of a chamber, _A_,\r\nconstructed with a false roof, _B_, to carry off the condensed vapours,\r\nand provided at both sides with doors, through which the waggons,\r\ncarrying the lead, are introduced and removed. The pipes, _n_, which\r\nconvey air and carbonic acid, are provided with branches, _e_, which\r\nreach to the sides of the chamber, and are joined to the perforated\r\ntubes, _D_. The pipes, _n_, are provided with reservoirs, _b_, which\r\nprevent the too rapid entry of the air or carbonic acid, and at the\r\nsame time give a sufficient heating surface. Upon the waggon, _E_, are\r\nthe frames, _v_, which support the lead plates. The plates may be solid\r\nor gratings; they are 3 to 12 millimetres thick, and are arranged at\r\nintervals of about 25 millimetres in the frames. The troughs, _F_, for\r\nthe reception of the acetic acid are filled from the reservoir, _Z_.\r\nThe steam pipe, _C_, effects the evaporation of the acid; the steam\r\npipe, _d_, heats the chamber at the commencement of the process, and\r\nalso when _C_ is out of use. When the chamber is filled with lead, the\r\ntroughs, _F_, are filled with acetic acid of 5 per cent. strength. The\r\nchambers are closed, and steam is led through _C_ and _d_ until the\r\ntemperature in the chamber reaches 25° to 50° C., and the evaporation\r\nof the acid begins. Then air is forced in under a small pressure\r\nthrough _n_, _e_, _D_ during 3 to 4 days, after which follows a mixture\r\nof equal parts of carbonic acid and air, continued until the formation\r\nof white lead is complete. When plates 3 millimetres thick are used,\r\nand the temperature is gradually raised from 25° to 50° C., about 12\r\ndays are required; but if the plates are 12 millimetres thick, 28\r\ndays are necessary. For the proper carrying out of this process it is\r\nimportant that the temperature of the chamber should be very gradually\r\nraised from 25° to 50° C.\r\n\r\nIn the process of P. Rey molten lead is poured in a thin stream into\r\nwater, and the “granulated” metal then placed in vessels, in a layer\r\n30 centimetres thick, upon a grating 5 centimetres above the bottom.\r\nIn the bottom are narrow tubes which, reaching above the lead, serve\r\nto admit air. Acetic acid is allowed to flow over the lead from vessel\r\nto vessel. In order to obtain the proper solution, a layer of lead, 2\r\nmetres thick, is necessary, so that 6 to 7 vessels are arranged, one\r\nabove the other. If lead acetate solution be used, the layer of lead\r\nneed only be 1·2 metre thick. The solution of basic lead acetate is\r\nthen treated with carbonic acid according to the ordinary process.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the modifications of the German white lead process which\r\nhave been described, many others have been proposed. The principle of\r\nmany of these methods is, that finely divided lead is much more rapidly\r\nconverted into white lead than lead in the form of plates; finely\r\ndivided lead exposes an enormously greater surface to the action of the\r\nacetic acid and other materials than do lead plates.\r\n\r\nIn Rostaing’s method the lead is changed into very small pellets, by\r\nallowing the melted metal to flow on to a rapidly rotating iron disc;\r\nthe molten lead, in consequence of the centrifugal force due to the\r\nrapid rotation, assumes the form of very small drops, which are thrown\r\noff the disc and cooled in a vessel of cold water.\r\n\r\nTorassa recommends that lead, obtained in pellets by pouring into\r\ncold water, should be brought into a rapidly rotating vessel, whereby\r\nthe greater part will be converted into fine dust (?). This lead dust\r\nis said to be then converted into white lead by simple exposure to\r\nair, lead oxide being first formed, and from it basic lead carbonate.\r\nThis process is not workable on a large scale. The rapid oxidation of\r\nfinely divided lead by air has been applied by several inventors to\r\nthe manufacture of white lead. The processes of Woods, M’Cannel and\r\nGrüneberg are founded upon this transformation. In essentials they are\r\nas follows: lead is finely divided in iron or earthenware cylinders,\r\nand either carbonic acid and air, or a mixture of these with acetic\r\nacid vapour, are introduced by means of the axle of the cylinders.\r\n\r\nIf a special apparatus is not provided, as it should be, on the large\r\nscale, to separate the unaltered lead from the white lead, the lumps\r\ncoming from the chambers must be subjected to a process of levigation,\r\nin which the lead, being the heaviest body, will be first deposited;\r\nthe last portions deposited consist of the purest white lead, the lower\r\nlayers of which will be tinged more or less grey by an admixture of\r\nfinely divided lead and lead peroxide.\r\n\r\nWhite lead manufactured by the German process occasionally exhibits\r\nperceptible reddish or greyish tinges, the cause of which lies in the\r\ndefective execution of the process. The red tinge denotes the presence\r\nof free lead oxide, caused by the use of an insufficient quantity of\r\nacetic acid. A grey tint is due to the presence of metallic lead or an\r\nexcess of lead carbonate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(c) FRENCH PROCESS.\r\n\r\nThe French process for making white lead is based upon the reaction\r\nwhich occurs when carbonic acid is passed into a solution of basic lead\r\nacetate; basic lead carbonate is precipitated and neutral lead acetate\r\nremains dissolved; the latter is again converted into basic acetate,\r\nfrom which carbonic acid again separates white lead and so on. This\r\nprocess, at present used on an enormous scale, is due to the French\r\nchemist Thénard, who first put it into operation on the large scale at\r\nClichy, near Paris. The method is also known as the Clichy process.\r\n\r\nThe operations of this process are divided into the production of the\r\nbasic acetate and the treatment of its solution with pure carbonic\r\nacid, whereby the basic carbonate is precipitated.\r\n\r\n1. =Preparation of the Solution of Basic Lead Acetate.=—The preparation\r\nof this compound has been already described; the following is\r\nsupplementary to what was previously given. If litharge be used, it is\r\ndissolved in wooden tubs heated by steam. The acetic acid is brought\r\nnearly to boiling by open steam, and the finely ground litharge\r\ngradually added. In consequence of its high specific gravity, the\r\nlitharge would quickly sink to the bottom, so that it is advisable\r\nto keep the liquid in motion by means of a stirrer, and to allow the\r\nlitharge to fall in in a thin stream. The introduction of the latter is\r\ncontinued until the specific gravity of the solution indicates that the\r\nliquid contains three equivalents of lead oxide to one equivalent of\r\nacetic acid.\r\n\r\nIn working with metallic lead, this must be used in a finely divided\r\nform; it is cast, as in the Dutch process, into thin sheets or\r\ngratings, or into flat wires or ribbons. These ribbons are easily\r\nmade by melting the lead in a pan provided with a delivery pipe with\r\nstop cock; beneath the latter is brought a vessel, which can be moved\r\nbackwards and forwards upon a tram line, filled with water. When the\r\nmelted lead is allowed to flow into this vessel, which is being moved\r\nbackwards and forwards, the metal forms long, thin ribbons, which\r\npossess a large surface. A wooden tub is almost completely filled with\r\nthese lead ribbons, which are then covered with acetic acid. After a\r\nshort time the acid is run off, when, by the action of the air, so\r\nenergetic an oxidation of the lead takes place that the contents of the\r\ntub become heated, and steam and acetic acid vapours begin to rise.\r\nWhen this is seen, the original acetic acid is pumped back into the\r\ntub, and left there for some hours in contact with the lead in order\r\nthat it may dissolve the lead oxide. When the solution has reached\r\na specific gravity of 1·1326 to 1·1415, it is drawn off from the\r\nundissolved lead, which again, in a short time, in consequence of the\r\nrapid oxidation, becomes warm, and is treated with fresh acetic acid.\r\n\r\nThe lead ribbons become finally so thin that they fall together by\r\ntheir own weight, and form tight masses, upon which air and acetic\r\nacid can no longer act. These residues are then removed from the\r\nsolution vessel and new ribbons introduced. The residues have a velvety\r\nappearance; when they are mixed up with water they make it dark, and\r\nfrom the turbid liquid a fine, velvet-black powder soon separates,\r\nwhich consists of finely divided silver. The liquid still remains\r\nturbid owing to the suspension of fine particles of carbon. The lead\r\nores, especially galena, often contain notable quantities of silver;\r\nsilver lead is generally desilverised before use; usually, however,\r\nsmall quantities of silver remain in the lead. When the lead is\r\ndissolved in acetic acid, this silver settles as a soft powder at the\r\nbottom of the vessels in which the lead residues from the solution tubs\r\nare washed.\r\n\r\n2. =Preparation of the Carbonic Acid and Precipitation of the White\r\nLead.=—The carbonic acid required for precipitating the basic carbonate\r\nis obtained either by heating limestone in a small furnace, from which\r\nthe gas is drawn by a pump, or directly by burning charcoal. In the\r\nformer case very pure carbonic acid is obtained, and, as a by-product,\r\nvaluable quicklime; in the latter case precautions must be taken to\r\nproduce pure carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\nThe furnace designed by Kindler for preparing carbonic acid (Fig. 16)\r\nconsists of a conical furnace, burning coal or coke upon the hearth,\r\n_a_. The passage, _c_, is divided by a vertical wall, in order to avoid\r\nobstruction from the piling up of fuel. The space, _K_, is filled with\r\nlimestone, through which the carbonic acid passes; the tanks, _e_,\r\nfilled with water, cool the limestone, and the gas, which then passes\r\nthrough the water in the washing vessel, _D_, is drawn off by a pump.\r\n\r\nIn the old process at Clichy the apparatus depicted in Fig. 17 was\r\nused. The basic lead acetate was made in the wooden tub, A, provided\r\nwith the stirrer, B C. The solution was run off from this vessel\r\nby means of the cock, b, into the settling tank, E, in which the\r\nmechanical impurities separated from the solution. The clear liquid\r\nran into the decomposing vessel, a large shallow covered tank, holding\r\n9,000 to 10,000 litres. In this tank opened 800 copper tubes, given\r\noff from the large pipe, S. The small furnace, D, in which limestone\r\nwas burnt with coke, produced the carbonic acid; from the pipe at the\r\ntop of the furnace the carbonic acid was brought into the Archimedean\r\nscrew, h K, was washed with water, and pumped into the solution of lead\r\nacetate. The introduction of the carbonic acid was continued from 10 to\r\n12 hours, after which the apparatus was left at rest until the liquid\r\nin the decomposing tank had become quite clear, through deposition\r\nof the white lead. The clear solution, now containing neutral lead\r\nacetate, was run off into the receiver, m, from which the pump, P,\r\ncarried it back into the dissolving tub, A, where it was treated with\r\nfresh quantities of litharge. The solution of neutral lead acetate\r\ndrawn off from the white lead had approximately a specific gravity of\r\n1·0901. The white lead at the bottom of the decomposing tank was a\r\ntolerably thick paste. It was transferred to the tank, O, and washed\r\nseveral times with water. The first wash waters, which contained small\r\nquantities of lead acetate, were returned to the dissolving tub. The\r\nresulting white lead formed a very soft powder; it was at once placed\r\nin the drying pans. The white lead prepared by this process is a\r\nprecipitate containing no coarse lumps, so that grinding is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the quantity of acetic acid with which the process is\r\ncommenced is sufficient to form an unlimited quantity of white lead,\r\nsince all the acetic acid brought into the decomposing tank in the form\r\nof basic acetate is returned to the dissolving tub as neutral acetate.\r\nIn practice, however, matters are somewhat different. Small quantities\r\nof acetic acid are lost in the wash waters; each time the solution of\r\nlead acetate is pumped back into the dissolving tub, a small quantity\r\nof acetic acid must be added to make up the loss.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\nThe method pursued by Ozouf, in France, is a considerable improvement\r\non Thénard’s process. Pure carbonic acid is used for the precipitation,\r\nand white lead of similar composition to that produced by the Dutch\r\nprocess is obtained, since the introduction of the carbonic acid can be\r\nregulated according to the volume and strength of the lead solution,\r\nand thus white lead of any desired composition can be produced. The\r\nmost elaborate precautions for the health of the work-people are taken.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of pure carbonic acid gas is based upon the absorption\r\nof this gas from a mixture of gases by a solution of sodium carbonate,\r\nand its evolution on heating the solution. The apparatus is shown in\r\nFigs. 18 and 19. The products of combustion obtained from the stove,\r\n_A_, are drawn by the air pump, _E_, through the pipe, _C_, into the\r\ncooler, _B_, which is regularly fed with cold water by _D_. The gases\r\ncompressed in the receiver, _E´_, deposit moisture there, and then\r\nproceed through 3 horizontal cylinders, _F_, of sheet-iron, provided\r\nwith agitators, in which the carbonic acid is absorbed by a cold\r\nsolution of sodium carbonate of 9° B. The unabsorbed gases escape\r\ninto the atmosphere through _G_ (Fig. 19). The sodium bicarbonate\r\nsolution is received in the wooden tank, _H_, after passing through\r\nthe 3 cylinders, _F_. The pump, _I_, of the alternating pump, _I I´_,\r\nlifts the sodium bicarbonate solution out of _H_ and sends it through\r\nthe pipe, _K_, into the tubular cylinder, _J_, which stands upon a\r\ncylinder of larger diameter, _J´_, communicating with it only by the\r\nvertical tubes. The bicarbonate solution rises between the tubes in\r\n_J_, passes through the pipe, _L_, drops in a fine spray through the\r\nrose forming its mouth, and by means of the vertical tubes passes into\r\n_J´_ and thence into _M_, where it is heated by means of a steam coil\r\nto 100° C. Carbonic acid is then evolved, and the residual solution of\r\nneutral sodium carbonate, after cooling in the vessel, _R_, by means\r\nof the cold coil, is drawn off by the pump, _I´_, again to enter the\r\ncylinders, _F_, by means of the pipe, _K_. The carbonic acid evolved\r\nin _M_, together with steam, enters _J´_ through _N_, and in rising\r\nin the tubes of the cylinder, _J_, is cooled by the falling spray\r\nof bicarbonate solution. The cooling is completed in the coil, _O_,\r\nsurrounded by water; the vessel, _P_, separates the condensed water\r\nand passes the gas on into the holder, _Q_. The pipe, _S_, connecting\r\n_P_ with the suction pipe of the pump, _J´_, serves to restore to the\r\nsolution of sodium carbonate the water it has lost, thus maintaining\r\nthe proper concentration. The cost of 1 cubic metre of carbonic acid is\r\n10 centimes, of 1 kilogramme 5 centimes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\nFor the production of white lead, the carbonic acid, by means of the\r\npipe, _U_ (Figs. 19 and 20), enters the cylinder, _T_, provided with\r\nan agitator and containing a solution of basic lead acetate. By means\r\nof the pump, _V_, the lead solution is fed into the cylinder, _T_,\r\nthrough _W_. The absorption of the gas proceeds rapidly; the progress\r\nof the operation is followed by the observation of a pointer moving\r\nover a scale; as the gas holder sinks the pointer moves upwards. After\r\nthe precipitation of white lead, the contents of _T_ are emptied into\r\nthe tub, _b_, in which rotate rakes attached to a vertical axis of iron\r\nplated with copper. When the white lead has settled, the supernatant\r\nsolution of neutral lead acetate is drawn off through the pipe,\r\n_c_, by means of the pump, _d_, and conducted into the water-tight\r\nvessel, _X_, containing a stirrer on the vertical axis, _W_, made of\r\ncoppered steel. Here litharge is added, and the resulting solution\r\nof basic lead acetate is conveyed to the cylinders, _T_, by means of\r\nthe pump, _V_, as already described. The white lead in the tub, _b_,\r\nby putting the stirrer in motion, is washed once with water which has\r\nbeen previously purified by a little lead acetate. It then goes into\r\nanother tub provided with stirrers, where it is several times washed,\r\nsodium carbonate being added to the last wash water until a sample of\r\nthe white lead is not coloured by a drop of potassium iodide solution.\r\nIn this way the wash water is obtained free from lead, and the product\r\nis said to be of better quality. This, however, is not in accordance\r\nwith the fact that good Dutch white lead generally contains some lead\r\nacetate. The two-cylinder pump, _h_, which is in connection with the\r\ngas holder, forces gas over the surface of the liquid in T in order\r\nto drive it into tubs which are not in the position shown for _b_ in\r\nthe illustration, and into which there is no direct flow. The washed\r\nwhite lead is brought into bags which are pressed in a hydraulic press,\r\ndried, ground, sieved and packed in casks. These troublesome and often\r\ndangerous operations have been modified by Ozouf in the following\r\nmanner. The pulp white lead runs from the tub, _b_, into the hopper,\r\n_g_, where it is kept mixed by a small stirrer, and from which it\r\npasses on to the cylinder, _f_, heated by gas from the inside. In its\r\nrotation the cylinder carries along the white lead and dries it, it is\r\nthen removed by a knife below the hopper, and falls on to an inclined\r\nplane. The hopper and cylinder are in a room provided with a good\r\ndraught.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\nThe lumps coming from the drying room are placed by workmen wearing\r\nrespirators in buckets on an endless chain, are carried to the mills,\r\nground and sieved; then, by means of an Archimedean screw, the white\r\nlead is conveyed to a cask in which it is evenly pressed by means of a\r\nspecial mechanism. A bell announces when a cask is full.\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of White Lead by means of Natural Carbonic Acid.=—In\r\ndistricts where currents of carbonic acid gas issue from the ground,\r\nthey can be used in the manufacture of white lead, and are actually\r\nutilised for this purpose. Natural carbonic acid may, of course, be\r\nused for any of the white lead processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n(d) ENGLISH PROCESS.\r\n\r\nIn this process, now no longer in use, white lead was obtained by\r\nmixing litharge to a stiff paste with a weak solution of lead acetate\r\nand exposing the paste to the action of carbonic acid. By continually\r\nkneading the mass by means of grooved rollers or of rotating cylinders,\r\nthrough the hollow axis of which carbonic acid was led, the paste was\r\nthoroughly brought into contact with the carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nBy this process a good product is only obtained when pure litharge,\r\nentirely free from the oxides of iron and copper, is used. The copper\r\noxide may be removed from the litharge by means of ammonia if this can\r\nbe obtained at a low price; but oxide of iron cannot be removed, and\r\nvery small quantities of it are sufficient to impart a yellow tinge to\r\nthe white lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n(e) OTHER METHODS.\r\n\r\nIn Payen’s process the lead sulphate obtained in considerable\r\nquantities as a by-product in calico printing is the raw material\r\nemployed. By treating this lead sulphate with a solution of ammonium\r\nor sodium carbonate, white lead and ammonium or sodium sulphate are\r\nproduced. The white lead is then freed from the soluble salts by\r\nwashing, mixed with a small quantity of lead acetate, and pressed into\r\nthe drying moulds.\r\n\r\nBy boiling lead sulphate with caustic soda and passing in carbonic\r\nacid (Puissant’s process), a white lead is obtained which differs\r\nconsiderably in composition from ordinary white lead.\r\n\r\nMany methods have been proposed with the object of converting insoluble\r\nlead salts, obtained as by-products or by an inexpensive process, by\r\ntreatment with alkaline or alkaline earth carbonates, into white lead.\r\nThe fact that none of these methods has obtained a permanent footing in\r\nthe industry shows that each must be accompanied by serious defects, or\r\ncan only be practicable under peculiar conditions.\r\n\r\nMagnesium carbonate is used in Pattison’s process to decompose lead\r\nchloride. Dolomite (magnesian limestone) is the raw material for\r\nthe magnesium carbonate. Coarsely powdered, it is heated at a low\r\nred heat, when magnesia is formed, the calcium carbonate remaining\r\nalmost entirely unaltered, since it requires nearly a white heat for\r\nits decomposition. The powder ground in water was, when treated with\r\ncarbonic acid under a high pressure, soluble, magnesium bicarbonate\r\nbeing formed, the saturated solution of which contains 2·3 per cent.\r\nof magnesia, and has a specific gravity of 1·028. The solution of\r\nlead chloride contains 1 part of the salt in 126 parts of water; it\r\nis mixed with a slight excess of the magnesium carbonate solution as\r\nquickly as possible. The liquid is drawn off from the mixing vessel\r\ninto a large receiver in which a precipitate deposits, consisting of\r\nwhite lead and a little oxychloride. After drying, the precipitate\r\nis ground with a small quantity of caustic soda to decompose the\r\noxychloride. A few days afterwards the mass is washed to remove sodium\r\nchloride and the product dried.\r\n\r\nThe process of Dale and Milner is similar to the above magnesia\r\nprocess. Litharge, lead hydroxide or insoluble lead salts are mixed\r\nwith sodium bicarbonate solution, and, with repeated additions of\r\nwater, ground until the formation of white lead is completed. The lead\r\ncompound and sodium bicarbonate are used in equivalent proportions.\r\n\r\nAccording to the process of P. Bronner (German patent 52,262), 3\r\nmolecules of freshly precipitated lead sulphate are heated with a\r\nsolution of 2 molecules of caustic soda, when the basic sulphate 2\r\nPbSO₄.Pb(OH)₂ is formed according to the equation—\r\n\r\n    3 PbSO₄ + 2 NaOH = 2 PbSO₄.Pb(OH)₂ + Na₂SO₄.\r\n\r\nOr 4 molecules of lead sulphate are decomposed by 2 molecules of\r\ncaustic soda, according to the equation—\r\n\r\n    4 PbSO₄ + 2 NaOH = 3 PbSO₄.Pb(OH)₂ + Na₂SO₄.\r\n\r\nThis transformation takes place at a temperature of 70° C. The\r\nresulting basic sulphate, although pure white, cannot be used as a\r\npigment on account of its lack of covering power; but by heating with a\r\nsolution of sodium carbonate it is converted into white lead.\r\n\r\n    2 PbSO₄.Pb(OH)₂ + 2 Na₂CO₃ = 2 PbCO₃.Pb(OH)₂ + 2 Na₂SO₄.\r\n    3 PbSO₄.Pb(OH)₂ + 3 Na₂CO₃ = 3 PbCO₃.Pb(OH)₂ + 3 Na₂SO₄.\r\n\r\nBy this process, which is harmless to the workmen, the lead sulphate\r\nobtained as a by-product in the preparation of mordants for calico\r\nprinting, can be converted into good saleable white lead. The lead\r\nsulphate may also be obtained from litharge, lead acetate or nitrate.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that white lead has a rose tint, which is\r\nclearly perceptible by comparison with a pure white sample. This\r\ncolouration occurs in white lead made from argentiferous lead. A very\r\nsmall quantity of silver is sufficient to produce the tinge of colour.\r\n\r\nOccasionally white lead which has been ground in oil and used for\r\npainting turns perceptibly yellow, the colouration being similar to\r\nthat observed on a surface painted with white lead from which light\r\nis almost excluded. The yellow colouration is due to lead oxide. This\r\nhas been proved by suspending such a white lead in water and treating\r\nit with carbonic acid, after which a surface painted with it remains\r\npermanently white.\r\n\r\n\r\n(f) OXYCHLORIDE WHITE LEAD.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of white lead, but differing from it in composition,\r\nvarious products are found which consist of lead oxychloride. This\r\ncompound is also known as Pattison’s white lead.\r\n\r\nPattison’s white lead can be much more cheaply manufactured than\r\nreal white lead, the raw material employed being the cheap galena.\r\nThe finely-powdered mineral is boiled with strong hydrochloric acid\r\nin closed lead vessels. Sulphuretted hydrogen is evolved, which may\r\nbe burnt to sulphur dioxide and so used to make sulphuric acid. A\r\nhot saturated solution of lead chloride remains, from which the salt\r\nseparates in small crystals on cooling. The crystals are drained in a\r\nbasket and washed with cold water to remove the acid. The pure lead\r\nchloride is then dissolved in hot water and mixed with lime water.\r\nPattison obtained lime water from dolomite by burning it, treating\r\nwith a little water to remove the easily soluble salts, and, after\r\nthe removal of this wash water, treating the residue repeatedly with\r\nwater in order to obtain a clear solution of pure hydrate of lime. When\r\npure limestone is used, it may be treated with water immediately after\r\nburning without any preliminary preparation.\r\n\r\nTwo equivalents of lead chloride are used to one equivalent of calcium\r\nhydroxide. Practical experience showed that the best product was\r\nobtained when the precipitation was very rapidly brought about. With\r\nthis object, both solutions entered the precipitation tanks through\r\npipes with narrow slits at the side, so that the liquids met in a thin\r\nlayer, in which the precipitation of the pigment was instantaneous. It\r\nis also necessary that lead chloride should be in excess throughout.\r\nThe liquid is allowed to stand for the precipitate to settle, which\r\nit does in a brief time on account of its high specific gravity. The\r\nsolution now contains the small excess of lead chloride in addition to\r\ncalcium chloride; lime water is added until the liquid turns red litmus\r\npaper blue. From the alkaline solution all the lead soon separates as\r\nlead hydroxide, which is dissolved in hydrochloric acid, and thus again\r\ncomes into the process.\r\n\r\nIn order to utilise the large quantities of hydrochloric acid obtained\r\nin the manufacture of soda, Percy described a process in which galena\r\nis ground with hydrochloric acid, whereby in 30 to 40 hours all the\r\nlead is converted into lead chloride, whilst the stony admixtures are\r\nunattacked. The lead chloride is then separated by levigation from\r\nthe undissolved minerals and washed until free from iron, when it is\r\ndissolved in hot water and converted into oxychloride by means of lime\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n=Lead Sulphite=, PbSO₃, can be obtained by passing sulphur dioxide into\r\na solution of basic lead acetate; lead sulphite is precipitated and a\r\nsolution of neutral lead acetate remains. The process is similar to the\r\nFrench white lead process, with the difference that sulphur dioxide is\r\nused instead of carbon dioxide. Lead sulphite has no advantages over\r\nwhite lead, and is more expensive; it has thus never found practical\r\napplication.\r\n\r\n=Lewis and Bartlett’s White Lead Pigment.=—In the lead works at Zoplin,\r\nin Missouri, galena is smelted with limestone and coal, lead fume being\r\nobtained in addition to metallic lead. The lead fume deposits are\r\nignited, and again worked for lead and lead fume. This last lead fume\r\ncan at once be used as a white pigment; it consists principally of lead\r\nsulphate, lead oxide and zinc oxide.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE LEAD-ANTIMONY PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\nLead antimonite and antimonate are both heavy, white powders which can\r\nbe used as pigments. They are dearer than white lead, to which they are\r\ninferior in covering power, and which they do not exceed in permanence.\r\n\r\n=Lead Antimonite= is obtained by heating 5 parts of finely powdered\r\nantimony with 20 parts of sulphuric acid until a dry, white mass of\r\nantimony sulphate is left. This is fused with soda ash, the melt is\r\nextracted with water, and lead antimonite obtained by precipitating\r\nwith lead acetate.\r\n\r\n=Lead Antimonate= is formed by introducing in small quantities at\r\na time a mixture of 1 part of finely powdered stibnite (antimony\r\ntrisulphide) with 5 parts of sodium nitrate into a red-hot crucible,\r\nboiling the mass with water and precipitating the solution with lead\r\nacetate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nENAMEL WHITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBarium sulphate, known as permanent white, enamel white, _blanc fixe_,\r\nbarytes white, is the only white pigment which is absolutely unaltered\r\nby exposure to the atmosphere. Lead pigments are discoloured in the\r\ncourse of time, and in the end turn black; bismuth white behaves in the\r\nsame manner; zinc white is much more lasting, but not quite permanent.\r\n\r\nEnamel white is really permanent; it deserves the greatest attention\r\nfrom the colour manufacturer, especially as it can be made by a very\r\nsimple and cheap method. When sulphuric acid or a soluble sulphate\r\nis added to the solution of a barium salt, all the barium is at once\r\nprecipitated in the form of barium sulphate.\r\n\r\nWhen quite pure, barium sulphate forms an extremely soft, brilliantly\r\nwhite powder, which offers complete resistance to the action of the\r\natmosphere, and also of strong acids and alkalis. It is extremely\r\ninsoluble, and can be precipitated from the most dilute solutions,\r\nand is then obtained in so fine a state of division that it cannot be\r\nfiltered from the liquid; it passes through the closest filter together\r\nwith the liquid. When the barium solution is heated to boiling before\r\nprecipitation, the precipitate is somewhat coarser, and can be filtered\r\noff without difficulty.\r\n\r\nBarium sulphate occurs ready formed in nature as the mineral barytes\r\nor heavy spar. Finely ground barytes may be used alone as a pigment,\r\nbut more commonly is used for reducing white lead, for which purpose\r\nit is particularly applicable on account of its high specific gravity.\r\nThis admixture must be regarded as diminishing the quality of the\r\npigment, because ground barytes has far less covering power than white\r\nlead. Artificial barium sulphate is in a state of division which cannot\r\nbe reached by grinding barytes, consequently it considerably surpasses\r\nthe latter in covering power.\r\n\r\nThe raw material for the manufacture of enamel white is either barytes\r\nor witherite (barium carbonate); the latter, however, occurs so rarely,\r\nin comparison with barytes, that the greater quantity of all barium\r\ncompounds is obtained from barytes.\r\n\r\nIf witherite is obtainable in large quantity, enamel white can be\r\nprepared from it by dissolving in hydrochloric acid and precipitating\r\nthe solution of barium chloride so obtained by sulphuric acid. If the\r\nwitherite is very pure, the process may be simplified by treating the\r\nmineral directly with sulphuric acid, and separating the enamel white\r\nby a process of levigation from the impurities. In this case it is,\r\nhowever, necessary to add a small quantity of hydrochloric acid to the\r\nsulphuric acid, for the latter forms on the surface of the witherite,\r\nat the commencement of the reaction, a thin layer of barium sulphate,\r\nwhich is quite sufficient to prevent the further action of the acid on\r\nthe witherite lying below. The hydrochloric acid forms barium chloride,\r\nwhich is at once decomposed by the sulphuric acid into barium sulphate\r\nand free hydrochloric acid; this again dissolves a fresh quantity of\r\nwitherite, and this process is repeated until the mineral is completely\r\nand quickly dissolved.\r\n\r\nEnamel white is, however, generally prepared from barytes, which is\r\nground into a very fine powder and converted into barium sulphide by\r\nheating with coal (see pages 41 and 42). Hydrochloric acid acting on\r\nthe sulphide produces barium chloride and sulphuretted hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe covering power of a pigment is greater the finer its state\r\nof division, so that it would appear advisable to precipitate a\r\nweak solution of barium chloride by sulphuric acid at the ordinary\r\ntemperature. When the barium sulphate has been completely precipitated,\r\na solution of pure hydrochloric acid remains, which ought to be\r\nutilised; but when very dilute barium chloride solution is used, the\r\nhydrochloric acid is so dilute as to be useless. The barium chloride\r\nis, therefore, given in practice such a strength that it has a specific\r\ngravity of about 1·198; when the barium sulphate has been precipitated\r\nfrom this solution the residual hydrochloric acid has a specific\r\ngravity of 1·043.\r\n\r\nWater of considerable purity must be used to dissolve the barium\r\nchloride. Experience has shown that water which contains appreciable\r\nquantities of organic matter does not give a pure white product. The\r\npresence of sulphate of lime in the water, which precipitates barium\r\nsulphate, need not be regarded, because the barium sulphate is so\r\nfinely divided that it remains suspended in the liquid, and is carried\r\ndown on precipitation of the enamel white by sulphuric acid. Carbonate\r\nof lime in the water causes the separation of barium carbonate; this\r\nmay be avoided by slightly acidifying the barium chloride solution,\r\nthus converting the calcium carbonate into chloride.\r\n\r\nAccording to C. A. F. Meissner, artificial barytes, suitable for use\r\nin oil paints, is obtained by precipitating barium salts by soluble\r\nsulphates in place of sulphuric acid, then quickly heating the washed\r\nand dried precipitate in a muffle to a red heat and throwing into cold\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAs has been already stated, enamel white is the most permanent pigment\r\nthat exists; it appears destined in course of time to replace white\r\nlead and all other white pigments, especially as its cost is generally\r\nlower than that of the other white pigments. It costs, for example,\r\nonly half as much as white lead. At present, the principal uses of\r\nenamel white are found in paper staining; it is not used to any extent\r\nin oil paints. On account of its permanence, it should be used in\r\nthe place of white lead and white zinc. It also appears particularly\r\nsuitable for obtaining pale shades; it can be mixed with any other\r\npigment in any quantity without altering it in the least. This is, of\r\ncourse, only true when the enamel white is completely pure, and when it\r\nhas been freed from every trace of hydrochloric acid by careful washing.\r\n\r\n\r\nLITHOPONE.\r\n\r\nA white pigment is obtained, according to Orr’s process, by lixiviating\r\ncrude barium sulphide, obtained by igniting barytes with coal, with\r\nwater and dividing the solution into two parts. Zinc chloride is added\r\nto the first portion, then zinc sulphate, and finally the second\r\nportion of barium sulphide solution. The white precipitate obtained\r\nby this process contains one equivalent of barium sulphate to two\r\nequivalents of zinc sulphide. It is collected, quickly dried, heated\r\nin retorts to redness, and, whilst still hot, thrown into cold water,\r\nby which its density and therefore covering power are increased. The\r\npigment is finally washed and ground. It is a good white, but when\r\nmixed with lead pigments discolours them by reason of the sulphide it\r\ncontains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nWASHING APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all colour works operating on a large scale, special apparatus is\r\nused, in which are carried out the washing, pressing and drying of the\r\npigments obtained as precipitates. Only pigments prepared in small\r\nquantities are filtered through filter paper. The treatment of enamel\r\nwhite and white lead requires the use of apparatus for this purpose in\r\na special degree. We insert a short description here.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of enamel white takes place most conveniently in tubs\r\nprovided with a stirring apparatus. When the precipitate of barium\r\nsulphate has once settled to the bottom, it is very difficult to\r\nagain mix it up with water by means of a hand stirrer, an operation\r\nwhich must be often performed in washing. If vessels be used provided\r\nwith a suitable mechanical stirrer, the precipitates are rapidly and\r\nthoroughly washed. We have already stated that vessels with a stirrer\r\ncapable of being raised out of the liquid were specially suitable for\r\nwashing white lead. Such an arrangement can with advantage be used in\r\nwashing all precipitates. Many of the mineral pigments have to be freed\r\nfrom admixed salts by washing. A description follows of an effective\r\nwashing apparatus with movable stirrer. In the cylindrical vessel (Fig.\r\n21), which may be of any size, is a vertical iron shaft rotating upon\r\na pin in the bottom of the vessel. On this axis is a horizontal wooden\r\ncrosspiece, the under surface of which is studded with brushes; the\r\ndisc, which this crosspiece carries, is united by means of two bars\r\nwith a second, in which is cut a screw moving on the screwed shaft. The\r\nshaft is rotated by means of the cog-wheels shown in the illustration.\r\nThe handle fastened to the upper disc enables the crosspiece carrying\r\nthe brushes to be raised or lowered. When the handle is held fast, this\r\ncrosspiece rises or falls according to the direction of rotation of the\r\naxis. The pipe shown at the side supplies the water for washing the\r\nprecipitates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.]\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of colours liquids have often to be brought into\r\nthe precipitating vessel which would attack the iron of the stirring\r\napparatus, so that it is advisable to make the connecting rods between\r\nthe two discs of such a length that the screws may be above the vessel.\r\nAll iron parts of the apparatus dipping into the liquid should be\r\nprotected by asphaltum varnish.\r\n\r\nWhen a specially heavy precipitate is to be washed, such as enamel\r\nwhite, chrome yellow or white lead, the stirrer is raised as high\r\nas possible before the commencement of the operation. When the\r\nprecipitate has formed and settled, the liquid is run off, the water\r\ntap opened, and the stirrer slowly brought down to the precipitate;\r\nthe brushes fastened to the crosspiece stir up first the top of the\r\nprecipitate, then the next portions, and so on until the whole of the\r\nprecipitate has been stirred up into the liquid. When this has been\r\naccomplished, the stirrer is kept going for some time, so that the\r\nwater may take up as much of the soluble materials as possible; it is\r\nthen raised out of the vessel, in which the precipitate again settles.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, two or three washings of permanent white, in an apparatus of\r\nthe construction described, are sufficient to render it quite free from\r\nacid. Washing must be continued until the wash water leaves blue litmus\r\npaper quite unchanged. When dry, precipitated barium sulphate is a very\r\nsoft powder of great whiteness, which, on account of the fineness of\r\nits particles, can be readily ground with binding materials.\r\n\r\nEnamel white loses, in a remarkable manner when completely dry, a great\r\nportion of its covering power and of its valuable property of being\r\neasily ground with oil or size to a homogeneous paste. It is not known\r\nwhether this alteration is caused by a molecular change of the barium\r\nsulphate, as is not altogether improbable. In order to preserve the\r\nvaluable properties of enamel white it is not, as a rule, completely\r\ndried, but is brought into the market in the form of pulp, which is\r\nobtained by bringing the washed precipitate into strong linen bags\r\nand allowing the water to drop through. This object is more quickly\r\naccomplished when the last wash water is drawn off only to such a point\r\nthat, when the precipitate is again mixed up by means of the stirrer,\r\na thin paste is formed. This paste is run into a centrifugal machine,\r\nof which Fig. 22 is an illustration. In the drum, B, provided with an\r\noutflow, R, the smaller removable drum, C, with perforated walls, is\r\ncaused to rotate by gearing, G, to which it is attached by the screw,\r\nV. The drum, C, is lined by a tight linen bag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\nWhen the drum is in rapid motion, the thick liquid in the washing\r\nvessel is run in. In consequence of the centrifugal force due to the\r\nrapid rotation, the whole mass is at once thrown on the sides of\r\nthe drum, the liquid penetrates the fine openings, is caught in the\r\nouter vessel, and runs away to a receiver, in which it is kept until\r\nthe finest particles of the precipitate, which will penetrate even\r\nthe closest fabric, have settled. The operation is continued until\r\nthe excess of water has been separated, when the bag containing the\r\nprecipitate is lifted out of the drum. Centrifugalised enamel white is\r\na fairly stiff, white paste, which should be packed in sacks lined with\r\noiled paper to prevent drying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFILTER PRESSES.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the use of filter presses for separating liquids from\r\nprecipitates and for washing the latter has become general. A filter\r\npress consists, as shown in Fig. 23, of a number of frames, between\r\nwhich are perforated plates and sheets of filter cloth, and which can\r\nbe pressed tight together by a screw. A powerful pump forces the liquid\r\ncontaining the precipitate into the hollow spaces of the frames (known\r\nas chambers), in which the solid body remains, whilst the liquid goes\r\nthrough the filter cloth. By afterwards pumping fresh water through,\r\nthe solid remaining in the chambers is soon completely washed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nZINC WHITE.\r\n\r\n\r\nZinc oxide, known as a pigment under the name of zinc white, is one of\r\nthe most important white pigments. Although not absolutely permanent,\r\nyet it has, in common with enamel white, the valuable property of\r\npreserving its whiteness in air containing sulphuretted hydrogen. Its\r\nlow price has brought it into general use.\r\n\r\nAlthough zinc white is a most important pigment, it is very seldom\r\nmade in colour works, because on account of its origin it is a product\r\nof metallurgical processes. Zinc white in chemical composition is\r\npure zinc oxide; it is formed when zinc vapour burns in air. In\r\nzinc-smelting works zinc white is obtained by putting zinc in tubes\r\nwhich are heated to whiteness; the zinc vapours burn when they come\r\nin contact with the air, and the zinc oxide is caught by special\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nThe retorts used for this purpose are similar to those employed in the\r\nmanufacture of coal gas. From 8 to 18 of these retorts are arranged in\r\na furnace, in two rows, one above the other. In the lid of the retorts\r\nis an opening, which serves for charging and for carrying off the zinc\r\nvapours. When the operation is commenced, the retorts being heated\r\nto a white heat, two zinc plates are brought into each, the metal is\r\nsoon volatilised, and the vapours pass through the above-mentioned\r\nopenings. A current of air, heated to 300° C., is blown in to meet the\r\nzinc vapours, which take fire and burn with a blinding white flame,\r\nproducing a very fine white powder, which is carried by the current of\r\nair through a series of chambers in which it deposits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\nC. Freitag recommends for the production of zinc white the use of\r\nretorts of oval section, _A_, Fig. 24. These retorts, containing crude\r\nzinc, are heated to a white heat, and then a mixture of generator gas\r\nfrom coke and air is introduced by _B_ and the pipe running through\r\n_B_. The zinc burns completely in the flame of the generator gas, which\r\ncontains excess of oxygen. A product of faultless nature is said to be\r\nobtained in this way.\r\n\r\nIn zinc works zinc white is always made in the manner which has\r\nbeen described. It may also be obtained as a by-product in another\r\nmetallurgical operation, the desilverisation of lead by Parkes’\r\nprocess. In this process an alloy of silver and zinc is obtained. By\r\nsending a current of superheated steam over the molten alloy the zinc\r\ndecomposes the steam, hydrogen and zinc oxide being formed. The zinc\r\nwhite is carried by the current of gas into chambers, in which it\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nThe zinc white obtained by burning zinc is, as has been said, a very\r\nfine pure white powder, which can at once be used for paint without\r\nfurther preparation. The price of zinc white is rather higher than\r\nthat of white lead, but the difference is counterbalanced by the\r\ngreater covering power of the zinc white. Ten parts by weight of zinc\r\nwhite completely cover a surface for which 13 parts of white lead are\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nWhilst white lead cannot be mixed with many pigments, such as those\r\nwhich contain sulphur, zinc white may be mixed with all without fear of\r\nalteration. Zinc white is even better than enamel white for producing\r\npale pigments from lakes; it has a lower specific gravity than enamel\r\nwhite, so that the mixture with the light lake can be more easily made.\r\n\r\nZinc grey, which is produced by some works, is zinc oxide discoloured\r\nby metallic zinc. Pure zinc white always has a pure white colour; if\r\nit is tinged with grey it is contaminated by metallic zinc, whilst a\r\nbrownish hue denotes the presence of cadmium oxide. The latter impurity\r\nwill be rarely met with in commercial samples, since cadmium is worth\r\nmuch more than zinc. Zinc oxide is used by the colour maker in the\r\npreparation of Rinmann’s green; it is also used, as stated above, as an\r\naddition to other pigments.\r\n\r\n=Griffith’s Zinc White.=—This pigment, which is equal in covering\r\npower to white lead, consists of zinc oxysulphide. It is obtained by\r\nprecipitating a zinc solution with a solution of barium sulphide,\r\nwashing, drying, igniting and grinding the precipitate. As it contains\r\nsulphur, it should not be mixed with copper or lead pigments.\r\n\r\n=Tungsten White= (Lead Tungstate), PbWO₄, is obtained as a heavy powder\r\nby precipitating a solution of sodium tungstate with lead acetate and\r\ntreating the precipitate, which consists of basic lead tungstate, with\r\ndilute acetic acid, by which lead oxide is dissolved and a salt of the\r\nabove composition left. This white pigment is dearer than other lead\r\npigments, and has no special advantages over them; it is, therefore,\r\nseldom used.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE ANTIMONY PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\nAntimony forms a number of white compounds which can be made by a\r\nsimple and inexpensive process, and might, therefore, be used as\r\npigments. Two antimony compounds in particular are so used—antimony\r\ntrioxide and oxychloride (powder of algaroth).\r\n\r\n=Antimony Trioxide= occurs ready formed in nature as white antimony or\r\nantimony bloom. It is very simply prepared by burning the metal in air,\r\nwhen it forms soft needles with a silvery lustre. It is only necessary\r\nto heat melted antimony to a little above its melting point in a\r\ncrucible placed in a slanting position, when the metal takes fire and\r\nburns with a blue flame. Nitric acid converts metallic antimony very\r\nquickly into antimony oxide with a copious evolution of brown fumes.\r\n\r\nAntimony trioxide may be more cheaply prepared from antimony sulphide,\r\nartificial or natural (stibnite), by finely powdering, moistening with\r\nwater, and gently warming on plates. Oxidation takes place, the sulphur\r\nis converted into sulphur dioxide and the antimony to trioxide. The\r\nheating should not be carried too far, or the antimony takes up further\r\noxygen and forms the tetroxide.\r\n\r\n=Antimony Oxychloride, or Powder of Algaroth=, is obtained by\r\ndissolving stibnite in strong hydrochloric acid, the operation being\r\nperformed under a chimney to carry off the sulphuretted hydrogen. The\r\nsolution of antimony trichloride, when the impurities have settled, is\r\npoured into a large vessel of water. At once a pure white precipitate\r\nis formed, which quickly sinks; it is washed with water until the\r\nwashings have no acid reaction. Washing should not be continued\r\ntoo long or the oxychloride will be further decomposed; by washing\r\nwith hot water it is almost entirely changed to antimony trioxide.\r\nThe precipitate, after washing with cold water, has generally the\r\ncomposition expressed by the formula SbOCl.\r\n\r\nAntimony oxide and oxychloride are both very crystalline powders, and\r\nhave in consequence small covering power.\r\n\r\n=Bismuth White= is not used as a painters’ pigment; it has no advantage\r\nover the white pigments previously described, and is much more\r\nexpensive. Its only use as a pigment is for the preparation of white\r\ncosmetics, and even for this purpose zinc white is now frequently used;\r\nit is cheaper and quite as satisfactory.\r\n\r\nBismuth white is prepared by treating metallic bismuth with fuming\r\nnitric acid. The white precipitate at first formed completely dissolves\r\nin an excess of acid, and when the solution is poured into a large\r\nquantity of water, basic bismuth nitrate—bismuth white—separates.\r\n\r\nPure bismuth white is a soft, heavy powder, brilliantly white; it must\r\nbe preserved in air-tight vessels as soon as it is dry, otherwise it\r\nacquires a yellowish tinge. Bismuth compounds are, if possible, more\r\nsusceptible to the action of sulphuretted hydrogen than lead compounds.\r\nThe yellow colouration, turning to black in the course of time, is due\r\nto black bismuth sulphide.\r\n\r\n=Tin White= is used for earthenware enamels. It is obtained by treating\r\ngranulated metallic tin with very strong fuming nitric acid. The heavy,\r\nwhite powder which is formed is separated from the undissolved tin by\r\nfloating. Tin white has no application as a pigment; when mixed with\r\nglazes it gives them a handsome, milky appearance.\r\n\r\n=Manganese White.=—When large quantities of a solution of impure\r\nmanganese chloride are at hand, such as are produced in the preparation\r\nof chlorine, manganese carbonate may be obtained. A small quantity of\r\nsoda solution is first added and the liquid left for several days so\r\nthat the oxide of iron may separate. When this is the case an addition\r\nof soda gives a pure white precipitate.\r\n\r\n=Magnesia White or Mineral White= is obtained, according to T. H.\r\nCobley, by mixing a solution of magnesium sulphate with calcium\r\nchloride, adding 10 per cent. of aluminium chloride to the mixture and\r\nstirring in slaked lime so long as a precipitate is formed. A cheaper\r\nprocess is to precipitate mixed solutions of magnesium and aluminium\r\nsulphates by slaked lime.\r\n\r\n=Annaline.=—A white pigment is recommended for use under this name; it\r\nconsists of dead-burnt gypsum, which has been converted into a fine\r\npowder by grinding and levigating. (Dead-burnt gypsum has been so\r\nstrongly heated that it is not able to again unite with water.)\r\n\r\nTo obtain paler shades of certain colours, additions are made of\r\nnatural pigments, such as chalk, which has been converted into a very\r\nfine powder by levigation. An addition of chalk to a heavy mineral\r\npigment, such as chrome yellow, is not advisable; it would, besides,\r\nseriously diminish its covering power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the preceding pages, a large number of white pigments has been\r\nenumerated. It would be easily possible to increase the list, but the\r\nresult would be of no practical interest, for other pigments, neither\r\nin respect of quality nor price, can compete with the cheaper white\r\npigments. Although white lead has at the present time an enormous\r\nuse, it is to be hoped that this pigment, of good colour but little\r\npermanence, may be replaced entirely in the course of time by zinc\r\nwhite, and for some purposes by enamel white.\r\n\r\nWhite pigments, in addition to their use alone, are employed to produce\r\ntints, which are obtained by mixing deeper colours with the white\r\npigment. By adding the proper quantity of white to a colour it is\r\npossible to produce all paler shades of that colour. For example, the\r\ndifferent varieties of the red lakes which are found in commerce are\r\nobtained by mixing white pigments with the deep red lakes.\r\n\r\nThe particular white pigment to be employed in these mixtures depends\r\non the nature of the colour and on its specific gravity. It should\r\nalways be remembered that white lead will not increase the permanence\r\nof a colour, since it will be discoloured in a short time by the action\r\nof the atmosphere. In the manufacture of fine colours for artists lead\r\npigments should be absolutely excluded.\r\n\r\nTo produce paler shades of colours which contain lead and therefore\r\nhave a high specific gravity, _e.g._, chrome yellow, white lead may be\r\nused; for other colours, barytes or zinc white should be employed. In\r\nthe case of lakes enamel white is too heavy; zinc white or magnesia is\r\nsuitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nYELLOW MINERAL PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs was the case with white pigments, so with yellow: of the large\r\nnumber known very few are in extensive use. In former times the number\r\nof yellow pigments employed in painting was far greater than at\r\npresent; several, formerly in general use, have dropped out, partially\r\nor entirely, owing either to their poisonous character or to their\r\nreplacement by others, deeper and more handsome. Especially since the\r\ndiscovery of cadmium yellow and the development of the manufacture of\r\nchrome yellows, many colours once in general use have properly fallen\r\ninto disuse.\r\n\r\nAgain, unfortunately, the most important of the yellow mineral pigments\r\ncontain lead, and have little stability; but a series of yellow colours\r\nfree from lead is known, and though some of them are inferior in shade\r\nto the lead pigments they surpass the latter in permanence.\r\n\r\nIn addition to lead compounds, pigments derived from barium, zinc,\r\nantimony and cadmium are in general use. The yellow lead pigments were\r\nformerly preferred, and at present, so far as concerns beauty, they\r\nmust be regarded as superior to other mineral yellows. The endeavour\r\nto provide the artist with permanent colours has resulted in the use\r\nof others, perhaps less brilliant, but very lasting. Under the name of\r\nchrome yellow a single pigment consisting of lead chromate was formerly\r\nunderstood; to-day, under this title is comprised a series of pigments\r\ncontaining zinc or barium in place of lead, but all commercially known\r\nas chrome yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nCHROME YELLOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chrome yellows are the lead, zinc or barium salts of chromic acid.\r\nIn describing the different methods used in making these colours, lead\r\nchrome yellow will be taken first, since this is the one most largely\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAD CHROME YELLOW.\r\n\r\nBoth neutral and basic lead salts of chromic acid are known. Neutral\r\nlead chromate is found in nature as the somewhat rare mineral\r\ncrocoisite, which is found in very small but perfectly shaped crystals\r\nin many lead mines.\r\n\r\n=Neutral Lead Chromate=, PbCrO₄, is formed as a very heavy precipitate\r\nof a fine deep yellow colour when a solution of potassium chromate or\r\nbichromate is added to a solution of a lead salt in water. When exactly\r\nequivalent quantities of potassium chromate and lead solution are used,\r\nand the strength of the solutions is the same, the product has the\r\nsame shade each time the operation is performed. It is not immaterial\r\nwhether the one or the other salt is in excess, or whether strong or\r\nweak solutions are used; all these conditions modify the shade of\r\nthe chrome yellow produced. Many colour makers are apparently of the\r\nopinion that some particular skill of the workman is necessary to\r\nproduce chrome yellow of a particular shade. This is, however, not the\r\ncase; manufacturers who know the simple conditions which are important\r\nin making chrome yellows may produce any desired shade without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nNeutral lead chromate readily parts with half the chromic acid it\r\ncontains. When treated with alkalis, such as lime or caustic soda, or\r\neven when digested with finely ground litharge, the neutral salt gives\r\nup half of its chromic acid, and is converted into the basic chromate\r\nor chrome red, Pb₂CrO₅.\r\n\r\nBasic lead chromate has, as the name chrome red indicates, a fine red\r\ncolour. If the quantity of lime or caustic soda used is sufficient to\r\ndecompose only a portion of the neutral lead chromate, a mixture of the\r\nyellow neutral and the red basic chromate is formed, the shade of which\r\nwill incline to yellow or red according as it contains a preponderance\r\nof one or the other compound. The pigment known as orange chrome is\r\na mixture of approximately equal parts of the neutral and basic lead\r\nchromates.\r\n\r\nIn order to brighten the deep yellow shade which distinguishes\r\nneutral lead chromate, it is either mixed with a white pigment, or\r\na white substance (lead sulphate) is precipitated from the solution\r\nsimultaneously with the lead chromate. In this manner all the\r\nimaginable pale yellow shades, lemon yellow, sulphur yellow, etc., can\r\nbe obtained.\r\n\r\nJust as the quantities of the solutions used and their strength\r\ninfluence the shade of the chrome yellow they produce, so it also\r\nappears to be not immaterial which lead salt is employed. Colour makers\r\nare generally agreed that the finest product is obtained from neutral\r\nlead acetate. Any lead salt, even insoluble in water, may be used for\r\nthe preparation of chrome yellow. The affinity of chromic acid for\r\nlead is so great that an interchange of constituents occurs between\r\nthe insoluble salt and the potassium chromate. Chrome yellow may be\r\nmade from lead acetate, chloride or sulphate; the resulting substances\r\nare the same, but there is a considerable difference in regard to the\r\nbeauty of the product. The finest chrome yellow, which leaves nothing\r\nto be desired in beauty of shade, is obtained by proceeding in the\r\nfollowing manner: Lead acetate is dissolved in water, the solution\r\ndiluted with an equal volume of water, and then mixed, under constant\r\nstirring, with a similarly diluted solution of potassium chromate or\r\nbichromate. The precipitate is immediately formed, and quickly sinks to\r\nthe bottom in consequence of its high specific gravity. It is washed\r\nwith clean water so long as this removes soluble salts. The precipitate\r\nis then drained on cloths and dried in the air.\r\n\r\nThe finest product is obtained by working with the following\r\nproportions:—\r\n\r\n    Sugar of lead              100\r\n    Potassium bichromate, or    50\r\n    Potassium chromate          40\r\n\r\nIf lead sulphate is used the following quantities are to be employed:—\r\n\r\n    Lead sulphate              100\r\n    Potassium bichromate        25\r\n\r\nIn the case of lead chloride the following is the proportion:—\r\n\r\n    Lead chloride              100\r\n    Potassium bichromate        27\r\n\r\nThe chrome yellows prepared from insoluble lead salts have no\r\nparticular beauty, but they may be used for mixed colours such as the\r\nspurious chrome green.\r\n\r\n=Preparation of the Lead Solution.=—Many makers of chrome yellow do not\r\nuse commercial lead acetate, but prepare its solution themselves. The\r\npreparation of this solution requires neither much space nor labour, so\r\nthat considering the high price of lead acetate this procedure may be\r\nregarded as advisable, but only when acetic acid is obtainable at a low\r\nrate.\r\n\r\nThe following is the method by which lead acetate solution is made.\r\nLead is granulated by pouring the molten metal from a height of\r\nseveral yards into cold water, which is kept in rapid motion. The\r\nsmaller the particles of lead, the larger surface they will possess,\r\nand the more quickly they will dissolve. For the solution of the\r\nlead small tubs are used, 50 centimetres in diameter and 90 to 100\r\ncentimetres in height, provided with a tap immediately above the bottom\r\nto run off the liquid. Four of these vessels are so placed, one above\r\nthe other, that the contents of each may be run into the one next below\r\nit. The lead in the top vessel is covered with acetic acid; in a few\r\nminutes this is allowed to flow into the second vessel, and similarly\r\nafter a few minutes from the second to the third, from the third to\r\nthe fourth, from which it runs away into a receiver below. After this\r\ntreatment it contains but a small quantity of lead acetate; the object\r\nof the operation is to start the oxidation of the lead, which quickly\r\nfollows when air has sufficient access, the lead particles lose their\r\nmetallic appearance and become covered with a white layer. When this is\r\nthe case, the acetic acid is pumped from the receiver back into the top\r\nvessel, where it is left one to two hours in contact with the lead. It\r\nis then run off into the second, and thence into the third and fourth,\r\nremaining in each vessel for about the same time; the resulting liquid\r\nis an almost completely neutral solution of lead acetate. The treatment\r\nwith acetic acid is continued so long as lead remains undissolved.\r\n\r\nThe solution of potassium chromate is prepared in a tub. The salt is\r\neasily soluble, and warming is unnecessary if the chromate is placed in\r\na basket, lined with close linen cloth, hung in the liquid so that it\r\nis immersed to half its depth. The salt rapidly dissolves, its solution\r\nhas a greater density than water, in consequence of which it sinks and\r\nfresh quantities of water continually come in contact with the salt.\r\n\r\n=Precipitation of the Chrome Yellow.=—Before the chrome yellow can be\r\nprecipitated it is necessary to estimate the quantity of lead acetate\r\ncontained in the solution, since upon this depends the quantity of\r\npotassium chromate solution to be used. If the lead solution contained\r\nonly acetate and water, its strength could be simply found by means\r\nof the hydrometer. It contains, however, varying quantities of acetic\r\nacid, on which account the hydrometer would give very inaccurate\r\nresults. The test by which the relation between lead solution and\r\npotassium chromate solution is found is performed in the following\r\nmanner: The lead solution is measured off in a cylinder divided into\r\n100 divisions; the same volume of potassium chromate solution is\r\nmeasured and placed in a high narrow vessel; the lead solution is\r\ngradually added to the chromate solution so long as a precipitate is\r\nformed. The precipitate settles rapidly, and there is no particular\r\ndifficulty with a little practice in finding with sufficient accuracy\r\nthe quantities required for the precipitation. In order to precipitate\r\n100 litres of potassium chromate solution, there are required as many\r\nlitres of lead solution as were used divisions of the cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the chrome yellow is now a very simple matter.\r\nWhilst steadily stirring, the measured quantity of lead solution is run\r\ninto the solution of potassium chromate; the precipitate is allowed to\r\nsettle, is well washed and dried. It does not make any difference to\r\nthe colour whether potassium chromate or bichromate is used; the same\r\nproduct is obtained in each case.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Dullo that chrome yellow prepared by the preceding\r\nprocess alters in colour on long keeping. This is ascribed to the\r\nformation of a basic compound. According to the same author, a chrome\r\nyellow free from this objectionable property is obtained by using\r\nlead nitrate in place of acetate and an excess of potassium chromate\r\nsolution. The writer has kept chrome yellow, made from lead acetate,\r\nfor years without observing the slightest alteration in the colour.\r\nOn chemical grounds, it is incomprehensible that a chrome yellow\r\nprepared from lead nitrate should have different properties to the\r\nsame substance prepared from another soluble lead salt, and freed from\r\nforeign substances by sufficient washing.\r\n\r\nThe product of this process is that which _par excellence_ is known\r\nas chrome yellow, the chemist’s neutral lead chromate; it exhibits a\r\ncharacteristic deep yellow colour, a shade which is known as chrome\r\nyellow. Under the microscope chrome yellow is seen to be a crystalline\r\nmass; it will possess greater covering power the smaller the crystals.\r\nNow, the motion of a liquid in which crystals are forming prevents the\r\nproduction of large crystals, thus the reason is clear for the rapid\r\nstirring of the solutions in the preparation of this pigment.\r\n\r\nAccording to C. O. Weber, who has published an exhaustive account\r\nof chrome pigments (_Dingler’s Journal_, 282), the cost of the\r\nlead chrome pigments varies greatly according to the raw materials\r\nemployed. Assuming that 100 kilogrammes of litharge cost 35 marks, 100\r\nkilogrammes of 30 per cent. acetic acid 25 marks, and 100 kilogrammes\r\nof 60 per cent. nitric acid 26 marks, Weber calculates that 100\r\nkilogrammes of litharge, in a form suitable for making chrome yellow,\r\nwill cost as follows:—\r\n\r\n    From lead acetate at 56 marks per 100 kilogrammes   96 marks\r\n     ”        ”       solution made in the works        80   ”\r\n     ”   lead nitrate at 50 marks per 100 kilogrammes   75   ”\r\n     ”        ”       solution made in the works        64   ”\r\n    By the basic lead acetate method                    51   ”\r\n      ”       ”       chloride  ”                       40   ”\r\n    White lead method                                   55   ”\r\n\r\n=The Pale Chrome Yellows.=—When the solution of the chromate used\r\nfor the precipitation of the lead solution is mixed with sulphuric\r\nacid, then a mixture of lead sulphate and lead chromate is formed\r\non precipitation. Lead sulphate is white, so that the colour of the\r\nprecipitate would be paler according to the quantity of sulphuric acid\r\nadded to the potassium chromate solution. There are, however, compounds\r\nof lead chromate and lead sulphate, of which we know two. Their\r\ncomposition is expressed by the formulæ:—\r\n\r\n    PbCrO₄.PbSO₄ and PbCrO₄.2PbSO₄.\r\n\r\nThe former is a beautiful lemon yellow shade, the latter nearly\r\napproaches sulphur yellow. By corresponding alterations in the quantity\r\nof sulphuric acid added, all intermediate shades can be obtained. On\r\nthe works these shades are made in the following manner: buckets are\r\nused for taking the potassium chromate solution out of the vessel\r\nin which it was made; these buckets hold 12·5 litres. Now, if the\r\nsolution of potassium chromate has been made from 25 kilogrammes of\r\nthe salt and 750 kilogrammes of water, one of these buckets holds\r\nexactly 0·43 kilogramme of chromic acid. In order to obtain the lemon\r\nyellow compound, 0·39 kilogramme of sulphuric acid must be added to\r\na bucketful of solution; 0·78 kilogramme must be added to obtain the\r\nsulphur yellow chrome. These liquids are prepared by pouring the\r\nsulphuric acid in a thin stream into the potassium chromate solution\r\nmade as above, the liquid must be stirred whilst the sulphuric acid is\r\nbeing added. The lemon chrome has the peculiar property of increasing\r\nconsiderably in volume soon after formation, a property to which\r\nregard must be had in the manufacture. A description of the rational\r\npreparation of the lemon and sulphur yellow shades of chrome yellow on\r\nthe manufacturing scale follows.\r\n\r\nIn making lemon chrome, the tub in which the precipitation is to take\r\nplace is two-thirds filled with water, the lead solution is stirred\r\nin, and then the chromate solution, mixed with the proper quantity\r\nof sulphuric acid, is run in; the liquid is well stirred so that\r\nthe precipitate may form as quickly as possible throughout the whole\r\nliquid. The precipitate is allowed to settle, the liquid drawn off, and\r\nthe colour washed twice with water as quickly as possible. The paste\r\nis then removed from the tub and poured on a strong linen strainer.\r\nAt first, the fine precipitate goes through the strainer, the liquid\r\nis poured back on the strainer until the size of its pores is so far\r\ndiminished by the precipitate itself that only clear liquid runs\r\nthrough. The precipitate is left on the strainer until it forms a stiff\r\nmass, which can be easily spread out upon boards by spatulas.\r\n\r\nTo obtain a good, that is, a loose product, it is necessary to carry\r\nout the processes so quickly that the swelling mentioned above does not\r\ntake place while the colour is being strained, but when it has been\r\nspread out on the boards. This swelling only takes place completely\r\nwhen the layer of precipitate is fairly thin. Large boards should be\r\nused, upon which the precipitate is spread out in a very thin layer.\r\nTo prevent the mass—which is still fairly fluid—from running off the\r\nboards, they are provided with raised edges, and the paste is spread\r\nout smoothly in these flat trays. If the operations have been properly\r\nperformed, the precipitate at once begins to swell and becomes of\r\na loose nature. When it has acquired a buttery consistency it is\r\ncut up, by means of a thin sheet of brass, into prisms, which are\r\nplaced near one another standing on the narrow side, and dried first\r\nin the shade and then in the sun. It is necessary that the drying\r\nshould take place slowly at first, or the cakes will crack or even\r\nfall to pieces. The precipitate cannot be washed completely in the\r\ntub, because it often begins to swell on the strainers, consequently\r\na crystalline crust covers the surface of the cakes during drying.\r\nThis layer must be removed by scraping the cakes of colour, in which\r\noperation small quantities of chrome yellow dust become suspended\r\nin the air. To protect the workman against poisoning by this lead\r\ncompound, precautions must be taken against breathing in the dust. The\r\nsimplest and most efficacious is to tie a wet sponge over mouth and\r\nnose; this retains the particles of dust in the inspired air. The dust,\r\nscraped off the cakes, is put into water, in which the salts dissolve,\r\nwhilst the chrome yellow sinks to the bottom. In this process for\r\npreparing chrome yellow the solution of potassium acetate left after\r\nthe precipitation contains a considerable quantity of free acetic acid,\r\nwhich may be utilised to dissolve lead.\r\n\r\nWhen sulphur yellow chrome is to be made, the process is substantially\r\nthe same as for the preparation of the lemon shade, but with the\r\ndifference that everything is done to prevent the swelling of the\r\nprecipitate. The precipitation and washing of the precipitate are done\r\nas quickly as possible: the washed precipitate is filled into press\r\nbags and strongly pressed. Care must be taken in the pressing that the\r\npressure is only gradually increased; if powerful pressure is applied\r\nat once, even the strongest cloths will be burst. The more thoroughly\r\nthe precipitate is pressed, the closer will be the fracture of the\r\nchrome, a property which is regarded as a sign of good quality in this\r\nspecies of chrome yellow.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of chrome yellow is intimately connected with that of\r\na number of colours, varying from orange to dark red, which are known\r\nunder the names of chrome orange or chrome red. In accordance with the\r\ndivision adopted of pigments according to their colour, chrome orange\r\nand chrome red will be considered among the red mineral pigments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nLEAD OXIDE PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nLead monoxide, PbO, exists in two different modifications; in the\r\ncrystalline form, as litharge, which is generally pale yellow with a\r\nreddish tinge, and amorphous, as massicot, which is yellowish red.\r\n\r\nLead monoxide is a product of metallurgical works rather than of colour\r\nworks; still the preparation of the crude oxide falls in the domain of\r\nthe colour maker, since from litharge several pigments may be prepared\r\nby a simple treatment.\r\n\r\nMassicot is obtained by heating white lead, lead nitrate or red lead,\r\nand also by heating melted lead in the air, with the precaution that\r\nthe oxide formed does not itself melt.\r\n\r\nLitharge is obtained as a by-product in several metallurgical\r\nprocesses, such as the cupellation of lead containing silver, in\r\nwhich the lead is melted in a furnace with a shallow hearth and a\r\npowerful current of air blown over the melted metal. The lead is\r\noxidised, the oxide melts at the high temperature approaching 1000°\r\nC., and flows through an orifice in the wall of the furnace, whilst\r\nthe silver remains on the cupel. The litharge is ground and levigated\r\nand, according as it is pale yellow or reddish, sold under the name of\r\nsilver or gold litharge.\r\n\r\nBoth massicot and litharge have no particularly striking colour; they\r\nare seldom used as pigments. Litharge has an extensive use in oil\r\nboiling and for the manufacture of lead peroxide, which is used for\r\nmatches.\r\n\r\n=Red Lead, Minium.=—Lead forms a number of other oxygen compounds, one\r\nof which, red lead, has the composition, Pb₃O₄. It is a bright red\r\npowder, used as a pigment and as a constituent of certain cements (for\r\ngas and water pipes).\r\n\r\nRed lead is, like litharge and massicot, a metallurgical product,\r\nbut, by working on a small scale, products can be obtained of a much\r\nbrighter colour than the produce of the large scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\nRed lead is made in two ways—directly from metallic lead or by heating\r\neasily decomposed lead salts. When it is made from the metal, the\r\nfollowing is the process: the lead, which must be very pure, is melted\r\nin a reverberatory or calcining furnace, oxidised to massicot by the\r\nair passing over it, and the massicot then, by careful heating, changed\r\ninto red lead, a process in which particular care must be taken that\r\nthe mass is not melted. By continued heating the massicot absorbs about\r\n2 per cent. of oxygen, and changes in colour to a bright red.\r\n\r\nThe art in making red lead by this process lies in maintaining\r\nthe proper temperature; the furnaces are constructed so that the\r\ntemperature may be regulated during the heating. A reverberatory\r\nfurnace is used, in which is a stirring apparatus, so that the heated\r\nmass may be continually turned over to accelerate the oxidation. Muffle\r\nfurnaces are also used, in which the massicot is placed in crucibles on\r\nan iron plate, which can be pulled out of the furnace for observation\r\nof the change of colour. Whatever method is used, the temperature must\r\nbe so regulated that over-heating of the material is avoided, otherwise\r\nlitharge is formed, which is only very slowly converted into red lead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\nMercier states that the muffle furnaces are arranged as shown in Fig.\r\n25. The muffle, _a_, is 2·5 metres long and 2 metres wide; its bottom\r\nrests on an iron plate. The passage, _d_, running under the muffle\r\nis 20 centimetres high; it is divided by a partition, and at each\r\nend are two hearths, _c_, 70 centimetres long and wide. The products\r\nof combustion pass from the long passages into side channels, _f_,\r\nprovided with dampers, go round the muffle and unite in the space, _g_.\r\nThe flue, _k_, at the back of the muffle is provided with dampers, _m_,\r\nwhich exactly regulate the current of air through the muffle; _n_ is\r\nthe chamber in which are collected the particles of oxide carried over\r\nby the draught. The furnaces used for manual labour consist, according\r\nto Percy (Figs. 26 and 27) of a rectangular or circular hearth, _a_,\r\nof about 3 metres diameter, which is deeper in the middle and has two\r\nfireplaces, _b_. The low arch surmounting the hearth is covered with\r\nsand in order to prevent cooling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\nWhen finished, the red lead is drawn out of the furnace and finely\r\nground under edge-runners, or occasionally levigated. The temperature\r\nnecessary in making red lead is that at which the angles of the\r\nmuffles, when these are used, begin to show a dark red glow.\r\n\r\nOrange lead, which is a brighter variety of red lead, is prepared from\r\nlead salts; white lead or lead nitrite is used for this purpose. The\r\nlatter salt is made by the process of Pischon, by heating 1 equivalent\r\nof lead nitrate with 4 equivalents of granulated lead and water at\r\na temperature between 50° and 60° C. After about 2 hours, the lead\r\nnitrite separates in the form of a granular yellow mass. According\r\nto Burton’s process, lead carbonate is oxidised by heating with 20\r\nper cent. of sodium nitrate and extracting the mass with water. There\r\nare also other methods by which red lead is obtained from litharge\r\nby the use of potassium chlorate or saltpetre; but these methods,\r\nwithout producing a finer product than those previously given, are more\r\nexpensive, and consequently have found no application on the large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nOTHER YELLOW PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cassel Yellow=, also known as mineral or Veronese yellow, has now a\r\nvery restricted use; it has been replaced by the deeper and cheaper\r\nchrome yellow. Much of the Cassel yellow of commerce is nothing but\r\nchrome yellow shaded with barytes. As regards chemical composition,\r\nCassel yellow has the following formula: PbCl₂.7PbO. It is obtained\r\nby heating litharge, red lead or white lead with ammonium chloride.\r\nTo 10 parts of the lead compound 1 part of ammonium chloride is used;\r\non melting, ammonia is set free, by which part of the lead oxide\r\nis decomposed, metallic lead separating. The melted mass is poured\r\noff from the lead into iron moulds, in which it solidifies to a\r\nvery crystalline substance of a fine yellow colour. By grinding and\r\nlevigating, the Cassel yellow is prepared for use. Pale yellow shades,\r\nobtained by admixtures of barytes, are occasionally encountered.\r\n\r\n=Montpellier Yellow= consists, like the preceding pigment, of basic\r\nlead chloride. It is obtained by gradually mixing 400 parts of powdered\r\nlitharge with a solution of 100 parts of common salt in 400 parts of\r\nwater. After each addition of salt solution the pasty mass must be\r\nthoroughly stirred, or it will harden. When all the salt solution has\r\nbeen mixed with the litharge to a homogeneous white mass, the latter is\r\ntreated with water to remove excess of salt, and the washed material\r\ndried and melted in earthenware crucibles. The melt, which has a bright\r\nyellow colour, is ground and levigated, when it forms a handsome\r\npigment.\r\n\r\nThere are several other yellow pigments of similar composition, of\r\nwhich one only need be mentioned, obtained by treating a solution of\r\nzinc chloride with lead hydroxide.\r\n\r\n=Turner’s Yellow or English Yellow= is prepared by two methods: either\r\nby melting 7 parts of finely ground litharge with 1 part of common\r\nsalt; or by treating litharge with a solution of common salt and\r\nconverting the white oxychloride into a yellow pigment by melting.\r\n\r\n=Naples Yellow.=—This handsome pigment, which is, unfortunately,\r\nsusceptible to the action of sulphuretted hydrogen, is known\r\ncommercially under different names. Naples yellow takes its names from\r\nthe fact that it was formerly exclusively made in Italy, where the\r\nmethod was kept secret, a secret which disappeared with the advance of\r\nanalytical chemistry. Naples yellow is now known to be lead antimoniate.\r\n\r\nNaples yellow is a handsome pigment. Its preparation is more tedious\r\nthan that of chrome yellow, hence it is now rarely employed. The author\r\nhas had practical experience that much of the so-called Naples yellow\r\nof commerce is nothing but a suitably shaded chrome yellow.\r\n\r\nNaples yellow can be prepared by different methods. According to the\r\noldest, given by Brunner, 1 part of pure tartar emetic is carefully and\r\nthoroughly ground with 2 parts of lead nitrate and 4 parts of common\r\nsalt. The mixture is melted at a low heat in a Hessian crucible, and\r\nthe fluid mass poured on a cold iron plate. After cooling, it is boiled\r\nout with water, when lead antimoniate remains as a powder of a more\r\nor less deep yellow colour. It is not easy to obtain this favourable\r\nresult with certainty in every case. If a certain temperature is\r\nexceeded only by a little, a hard mass results, which by long boiling\r\ndoes not become a fine powder, but a sandy substance of little\r\nbrilliance. Even when the operation succeeds, the product often varies\r\nconsiderably in shade, sometimes a sulphur yellow, at other times an\r\norange pigment being formed. As a rule, the paler product is obtained\r\nat a lower temperature; by stronger heating, darker products of a red\r\nshade are obtained.\r\n\r\nAccording to another recipe, 2 parts of tartar emetic are melted with 4\r\nparts of lead nitrate and 8 parts of common salt. The mass is treated\r\nwith very dilute hydrochloric acid for a long time, which extracts some\r\nquantity of lead oxide, a deeper product being thus obtained. Care is,\r\nhowever, necessary in this treatment; acid of too great strength would\r\nspoil the whole product.\r\n\r\nThe Paris method for Naples yellow is as follows: metallic antimony is\r\noxidised by melting in air; to 12 parts of antimony, 8 parts of red\r\nlead and 4 parts of zinc oxide are used, and the mixture is melted at a\r\nlow red heat.\r\n\r\nA cheap, but not particularly bright product, can be obtained from old\r\nprinter’s type. The metal, which is an alloy of antimony and lead, is\r\npowdered, mixed with 3 parts of saltpetre and 4 parts of common salt,\r\nmelted, and the mass washed out with water.\r\n\r\nOther formulæ which are said to yield a good result are as follows:\r\n12 parts of white lead, 3 parts of antimony oxide, 1 part of ammonium\r\nchloride, 1 part of alum. Or: 16 parts of stibnite, 24 parts of lead,\r\n1 part of common salt and 1 part of ammonium chloride. The intimate\r\nmixture of these materials is first gently heated with access of air,\r\nthen more strongly, and the mass extracted with water. There are many\r\nother recipes for the preparation of Naples yellow, the majority of\r\nwhich are distinguished by an apparently arbitrary arrangement of the\r\nmaterials; for there is no scientific reason. If it were possible to\r\naccurately obtain any desired high temperature in a furnace, the\r\nmanufacture of Naples yellow would no longer be a matter of skill, but\r\nthe same product could be obtained at every attempt. Since this is not\r\nyet the case, the exact procedure for the preparation of this colour\r\ncan only be found by careful experiments.\r\n\r\nNaples yellow is, as has been said, a handsome colour, and offers a\r\ngreat resistance to varied reagents. It is only changed by one of them,\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, by the prolonged action of which it is turned\r\ncompletely black.\r\n\r\n=Antimony Yellow= is very similar in composition to Naples yellow.\r\nIt consists of a mixture of lead antimoniate with the oxides of lead\r\nand bismuth. It is prepared by the process recommended by Meromé by\r\nintimately mixing 3 parts of finely powdered bismuth with 24 parts\r\nof powdered stibnite and 64 parts of saltpetre, melting the mixture\r\nand shaking it whilst molten into water. The brittle mass is finely\r\npowdered, washed and dried, then melted with 128 parts of litharge\r\nand 8 parts of sal ammoniac. The mass obtained has a fine pale yellow\r\ncolour; when powdered it is antimony yellow. This pigment has almost\r\nfallen into disuse because of its instability and the high price of\r\nbismuth.\r\n\r\n=Calcium Chrome Yellow.=—Calcium forms a yellow pigment with chromic\r\nacid, which, although far surpassed by the lead chromes in fineness of\r\nshade, has the advantage over them of greater stability and cheapness.\r\nFor purposes for which cheap and at the same time permanent colours\r\nare required calcium chrome yellow can be recommended. It is most\r\nsimply prepared from potassium chromate and calcium chloride, which,\r\nas a by-product of many chemical operations, is obtainable at very low\r\nprices. The deepest pigment is obtained when the precipitation is done\r\nwith a boiling solution of the chromate. Calcium chromate, in addition\r\nto its use alone, may be employed instead of white pigments to produce\r\npale shades from deep lead chromes. This addition should not be carried\r\nto a great extent or the chrome will be made too light, since calcium\r\nchromate has a much lower specific gravity than lead chromate.\r\n\r\n=Barium Yellow, Yellow Ultramarine or Permanent Yellow.=—This pigment\r\nconsists of barium chromate. The finest product is obtained when a\r\nsolution of a barium salt, generally barium chloride, is precipitated\r\nboiling by a solution of potassium chromate. The very finely divided\r\nprecipitate has a pale yellow colour very similar to that of pale\r\nlead chromes. This handsome pigment is distinguished by the valuable\r\nproperty of being practically unaltered by the atmosphere; it is only\r\nattacked by strong acids and alkalis. By long heating, the colour of\r\nthis compound is gradually changed to a handsome green, which consists\r\nof a compound of barium and chromic oxides, and has occasional use as\r\nan artists’ colour. In order to obtain this pigment, the heating must\r\nbe intense and long continued. According to the author’s experiments,\r\nit is not sufficient to heat for a short time to a very high\r\ntemperature; in that way a mass is obtained of very unequal colour. The\r\nbest result was obtained by spreading barium yellow in a thin, even\r\nlayer in a flat porcelain dish and heating to whiteness for 10 hours.\r\n\r\n=Zinc Chrome Yellow.=—Zinc chromate is inferior to lead chromate in\r\nbeauty, but has the advantage of permanence. It does not blacken in an\r\natmosphere of pure sulphuretted hydrogen, and resists very well the\r\naction of other agents. Zinc yellow may be prepared by the immediate\r\nprecipitation of a solution of zinc sulphate by a solution of potassium\r\nchromate, both being boiling, but the very bright precipitate obtained\r\nin this way is not stable; on washing, it gives up chromic acid\r\ncontinually to the wash water, and only a pale yellow residue remains.\r\nA very fine colour is obtained in the following manner: zinc sulphate\r\nis dissolved in water and boiled for half an hour with 1 per cent.\r\nof white zinc whilst stirring. This operation effects the separation\r\nof iron oxide and the neutralisation of the free acid generally\r\npresent in commercial zinc sulphate. When the solution has cleared by\r\nstanding, it is precipitated by a solution of potassium chromate, the\r\nprecipitate collected on a filter and allowed to drain completely; it\r\nis then washed with very small quantities of water and finally dried.\r\nA pure yellow precipitate is only obtained when all the iron oxide has\r\nbeen removed by boiling the zinc sulphate solution with white zinc;\r\nif the liquid contains only a very small quantity of iron, it has yet\r\na very considerable influence on the colour, the yellow is not pure,\r\nbut has a brownish tinge. Zinc yellow is used alone, and mixed with\r\nother pigments. Chrome yellows of all possible shades may be obtained\r\nin this way. Chrome yellows are often found in commerce which consist\r\nessentially of zinc chromate.\r\n\r\n=Cadmium Chrome Yellow.=—When a solution of cadmium sulphate, or any\r\nother cadmium salt, is mixed with a solution of potassium chromate, a\r\nprecipitate of cadmium chromate, CdCrO₄, is formed. This pigment has\r\na beautiful, deep yellow colour, in no way inferior in shade to the\r\nfinest lead chromes, and having the great advantage over the latter of\r\nbeing entirely unaltered by the atmosphere; it is thus to be highly\r\nrecommended for artistic purposes. The high price at which it is sold\r\nprevents its general use, though now that cadmium compounds are to be\r\nobtained at so much lower prices than formerly, the price of cadmium\r\nchromate appears to be excessively high.\r\n\r\n=Cadmium Yellow= is cadmium sulphide, CdS; in nature it occurs as\r\nthe somewhat rare mineral greenockite. Cadmium yellow is obtained by\r\ndissolving metallic cadmium in sulphuric acid, and precipitating the\r\nsolution with sulphuretted hydrogen. The solution of cadmium sulphate\r\nmust be digested for some time with excess of cadmium, in order to\r\nseparate the foreign metals present as impurities; the colour is not so\r\nfine when a quite pure cadmium solution is not used.\r\n\r\nCadmium yellow is a very bright yellow. Several shades are obtained\r\naccording as the solution of cadmium sulphate used in its precipitation\r\nis neutral or acid. The reason of this difference in shade lies\r\napparently in the different size of the crystals of which the\r\nprecipitate is composed. The deep, pure yellow colour becomes still\r\ndeeper by fusion, which takes place at a white heat. Weak alkalis,\r\nacids and sulphuretted hydrogen do not alter cadmium yellow; it is\r\nthus to be regarded as a durable artists’ colour. It can be mixed\r\nwith ultramarine without decomposition, when a fine green is formed;\r\nbut mixed colours cannot be made from cadmium yellow and blue copper\r\npigments, since these would blacken in the light.\r\n\r\n=Lead Iodide.=—On precipitating a solution of lead nitrate with\r\npotassium iodide, lead iodide is formed. This is but slightly\r\nsoluble in water, and, when dry, has a handsome, deep yellow colour.\r\nUnfortunately it is not permanent, but is decomposed on exposure to\r\nlight. It can be used for bronzing, but other and cheaper pigments are\r\navailable for this purpose.\r\n\r\nOn account of the great solubility of lead iodide in a solution of\r\npotassium iodide, it is prepared in another way, and accurately\r\nweighed quantities are used. Calcium iodide may be used instead of the\r\npotassium salt; 100 parts of iodine, 15 parts of fine iron filings and\r\n25 parts of lime are mixed with sufficient water to form a thin paste,\r\nwhich is warmed until all the iodine is dissolved, when water is added,\r\nthe liquid filtered, and the residue washed in order to extract all\r\nthe calcium iodide. The solution and wash waters are united, then a\r\nsolution of 152 parts of lead acetate is added, when all the iodine is\r\nprecipitated as lead iodide.\r\n\r\nA simpler method is to dissolve equal parts of lead nitrate and\r\npotassium iodide separately, each in 20 parts of hot water, to mix the\r\nsolutions and cool quickly, when lead iodide separates in very small\r\ncrystals. When pure lead iodide is melted in the absence of air, and\r\nthe fused mass powdered, a product of yet finer colour is formed. It\r\nis necessary to completely imbed the crucible in which the fusion is\r\nperformed in the fire. The action of air on the melted mass would\r\nproduce a basic iodide. The fine golden yellow colour of lead iodide\r\nadapts it especially for the production of gold bronzes on wall papers\r\nand fabrics.\r\n\r\n=Mars Yellow=, which is generally reckoned among the best artists’\r\ncolours, is usually a mixture of ferric oxide and calcium sulphate\r\nor alumina. The pigment is prepared by mixing a solution of ferrous\r\nsulphate with milk of lime, when ferrous oxide is precipitated, which\r\nbecomes yellowish brown on exposure to air, in consequence of the\r\noxidation of the ferrous oxide. By heating the precipitate, according\r\nto the temperature different shades are obtained, varying between\r\nyellow and red. In addition to Mars yellow, Mars orange and Mars red\r\nare found in commerce.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of this pigment is very simple: 1 part of ferrous\r\nsulphate is dissolved in 10 parts of water, and the solution mixed with\r\nmilk of lime made from 1 part of quicklime and 40 parts of water. If it\r\nis desired to produce a darker shade, and especially a product to be\r\nafterwards converted into Mars orange, the amount of ferrous sulphate\r\nis increased to 2 parts. When the mixture has been made, it must be\r\nstirred for a long time, in order that the reacting substances may come\r\nthoroughly into contact. The precipitate, which at first is greenish\r\ngrey, soon acquires by the action of the air the colour of ferric\r\nhydroxide, which becomes deeper on drying.\r\n\r\nWhen dried and finely ground Mars yellow is heated in thin layers, it\r\nchanges to dark yellow, and finally to orange red, a similar alteration\r\ntaking place to that occurring when ferric hydroxide itself is heated.\r\n\r\nA Mars yellow of a deeper shade, consisting of a mixture of ferric\r\nhydroxide and alumina, is obtained by precipitating with caustic soda\r\na solution of ferrous sulphate and alum. The sodium sulphate which is\r\nformed at the same time must be removed as completely as possible by\r\nwashing with boiling water.\r\n\r\nBy calcining Mars yellow for a long time at a high temperature, Mars\r\nbrown is produced, a fine brown pigment. The value of Mars yellow and\r\nthe pigments obtained from it lies not only in their fine shade, but in\r\ntheir permanence, which distinguishes the majority of the iron colours.\r\n\r\n=Siderin Yellow.=—This not very handsome yellow consists of ferric\r\nchromate; it is obtained by adding a neutral solution of ferric\r\nchloride to a strong boiling solution of potassium bichromate so long\r\nas a precipitate is formed. Siderin yellow is said to be used both\r\nin oil and water, and to be particularly adapted for use in sodium\r\nsilicate paints, since in the course of time it forms a stony mass with\r\nthat substance.\r\n\r\nThe low price of iron salts would make it desirable to employ chromates\r\nof iron, but it appears to be difficult to obtain a compound of\r\nconstant composition. In experiments with this object the author did\r\nnot succeed in obtaining products of the same shade. Others have\r\nprobably been equally unsuccessful, for siderin yellow has never been\r\nused in quantity, as it would have been were there no difficulties in\r\nthe way of its preparation.\r\n\r\n=Aureolin= is a double nitrite of cobalt and potassium, Co(NO₂)₂.3\r\nKNO₂. This pigment is prepared by adding excess of potassium nitrite to\r\na solution of cobalt nitrate acidified with acetic acid. As the liquid\r\ncools, a deep lemon yellow crystalline powder separates, which, when\r\ndry, is known as Indian yellow or aureolin. It is distinguished from\r\nother yellow pigments by being unaffected by sulphuretted hydrogen.\r\n\r\nThe potassium nitrite required in the preparation of this pigment\r\nis most easily made by melting saltpetre in a thick iron vessel and\r\nstirring in fine iron filings in small quantities as soon as the\r\nsaltpetre begins to decompose. The iron glows brightly and burns\r\nto oxide, the saltpetre changes to potassium nitrite. The mass is\r\ndissolved in a little hot water, the solution filtered and cooled,\r\nwhen most of the undecomposed saltpetre crystallises out, whilst the\r\nnitrite remains in solution. After further evaporation and separation\r\nof another crop of potassium nitrate crystals, the solution can be used\r\nto precipitate the aureolin.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to use strong solutions in the precipitation of\r\naureolin; the finest precipitate is obtained in this way. If dilute\r\nsolutions are used, the precipitate forms gradually; it is then coarse\r\nand has little covering power.\r\n\r\nAccording to the method of Hayes, aureolin is prepared by passing into\r\na solution of cobalt nitrate the vapours produced by pouring nitric\r\nacid over copper and allowing air to enter. Caustic potash is added\r\nto the liquid from time to time. In this way all the cobalt can be\r\nobtained in the form of a yellow precipitate.\r\n\r\n=Tungsten Yellow.=—Finely powdered tungsten is introduced in small\r\nquantities into fused potassium carbonate so long as effervescence\r\noccurs. After boiling with water and filtering, calcium tungstate is\r\nprecipitated from the filtrate by means of calcium chloride. The moist\r\nprecipitate is added to hot dilute nitric acid until the liquid is only\r\nslightly acid, when it is boiled for half an hour and allowed to cool.\r\nThe precipitate, after washing with a little water and drying, is a\r\ndeep lemon yellow powder.\r\n\r\n=Nickel Yellow= consists of nickel phosphate. It is obtained by adding\r\nsodium phosphate to a solution of nickel sulphate or nitrate, and\r\nheating the pale green precipitate to redness. Nickel yellow has a\r\npleasing shade, and is distinguished by great permanence. Up to the\r\npresent it has found little use as an artists’ colour, but on account\r\nof its permanence, which does not distinguish many yellow pigments, its\r\nuse is to be recommended.\r\n\r\n=Mercury Yellow or Turpeth Mineral= is a basic mercuric sulphate of the\r\nformula Hg₃SO₆. It is obtained by heating 10 parts of mercury with 15\r\nparts of sulphuric acid in a porcelain dish in a good draught, until a\r\nwhite crystalline mass of neutral mercury sulphate remains. This salt,\r\nHgSO₄, is decomposed in contact with water into free sulphuric acid and\r\na basic salt of the above composition. The decomposition is effected\r\nby treating the finely powdered neutral sulphate with hot water so\r\nlong as the washings are acid, when a handsome lemon yellow substance\r\nremains. The wash waters contain acid mercuric sulphate. They are\r\nallowed to stand with mercuric oxide so long as this is dissolved, and\r\nthe solution then used to prepare new quantities of mercury yellow.\r\n\r\nTurpeth mineral has a very bright shade and great covering power,\r\nbut it has little permanence. Sunlight soon turns it grey, and air\r\ncontaining sulphuretted hydrogen in a short time turns it quite black,\r\nmercury sulphide being formed.\r\n\r\n=Yellow Arsenic Pigments.=—The extremely poisonous character of arsenic\r\npigments has practically banished these handsome and cheap colours\r\nfrom use. In many countries their use is justly illegal. The majority\r\nof arsenic pigments have, therefore, merely historic interest. The two\r\nyellow arsenic pigments are found in nature as realgar and orpiment;\r\nthough these are not rare minerals, the artificial products were\r\ngenerally used as pigments, and when they were in common use they were\r\ngenerally made in metallurgical works, in which minerals containing\r\narsenic were treated.\r\n\r\nRealgar, As₂S₂, has an orange red colour, whilst orpiment, As₂S₃, is a\r\npure yellow. When these substances were used as pigments they had the\r\nsame drawbacks in regard to mixing with other pigments as other sulphur\r\ncompounds. King’s yellow is finely powdered natural or artificial\r\norpiment.\r\n\r\n=Lead Arsenite= is a permanent deep yellow, but extremely poisonous. It\r\ncan be made by fusing an intimate mixture of 100 parts of white arsenic\r\nwith 75 parts of gold litharge, grinding and levigating the mass.\r\nCadmium yellow, which has still more permanence and is less poisonous,\r\nreplaces this pigment.\r\n\r\n=Thallium Pigments.=—Thallium is a metal which exhibits certain\r\nsimilarities to lead. By precipitating a solution of a thallium salt\r\nwith potassium chromate or bichromate, according to the proportion\r\nbetween the quantities of the two salts, precipitates are obtained of\r\nyellow, orange or deep red colour, or, after fusion, brown. By the\r\naddition of a mixture of potassium chromate and ferricyanide to a\r\nmixture of a thallium salt and ferrous sulphate an olive green pigment\r\nis obtained. On account of the rarity of thallium compounds, technical\r\nemployment is out of the question, and the sensitiveness of thallium\r\npigments towards sulphuretted hydrogen prevents their use for artistic\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMOSAIC GOLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMosaic gold consists of tin disulphide, SnS₂, fine scales of a golden\r\nyellow colour, which sublime undecomposed at a fairly high temperature\r\nand withstand the action of chemical reagents. It has a peculiar greasy\r\nnature, and can be easily ground. It is, therefore, much used for\r\nbronzing picture frames, as a pigment for painters and for wall papers.\r\n\r\nTin disulphide can be prepared either in the wet or the dry way; in\r\nthe wet way, by the action of sulphuretted hydrogen on a solution of\r\ntin tetrachloride. The yellow precipitate so obtained has no handsome\r\ncolour. A far finer product is obtained in the dry way. The process\r\nis often regarded as accompanied by particular difficulties, but\r\nin reality it is quite simple. It is only necessary in preparing\r\nthis pigment to take care not to raise the temperature above a\r\ncertain point, otherwise a great portion of the tin disulphide will\r\nbe decomposed into sulphur and tin monosulphide. To prevent the\r\ntemperature from rising too high, an addition of ammonium chloride\r\nis made. This salt is volatile at a certain temperature; heat which\r\nwould otherwise raise the temperature above this point is used in\r\nvolatilising the ammonium chloride. With a little care it is easy to\r\ninterrupt the operation before all the ammonium chloride has been\r\ndriven off. The mosaic gold then obtained has a real golden glitter.\r\nIf the temperature rises too high, grey tin monosulphide is formed,\r\nwhich naturally considerably diminishes the brilliancy of the product.\r\nAmmonium chloride may be replaced by mercury or mercury compounds,\r\nwhich are volatile at a temperature below that at which mosaic gold\r\nis decomposed. When mercury compounds are used, both on account of\r\ntheir cost and poisonous nature the heating must be conducted in glass\r\nretorts in order to recover the mercury. This operation requires great\r\ncare if loss due to the breakage of the glass vessels at the high\r\ntemperature is to be avoided. The process in which metallic mercury is\r\nused gives the finest product of all, and is to be recommended when a\r\npigment is to be prepared which shall as nearly as possible approximate\r\nto the appearance of gold.\r\n\r\nIn order to obviate the danger and loss associated with the use of\r\nglass vessels, manufacturers who make mosaic gold in large quantity\r\nshould use an iron vessel. This will last a very long time. Such an\r\napparatus consists of an iron pan with a broad rim, upon which is\r\nfastened a head which has the form of a retort neck; to this are\r\nconnected short, wide tubes leading to a chamber in which substances\r\nnot condensed in the retort neck may deposit, so that the use of this\r\ninexpensive apparatus will not only be without danger, but will be\r\naccompanied by the recovery of almost the whole of the volatilised\r\nsubstances. The pan is filled with the materials, the head placed on,\r\nthe joint tightly luted, and the retort neck connected with the chamber\r\nby the wide iron tubes.\r\n\r\nThere are many formulæ for the preparation of mosaic gold. Some of the\r\nmost important are given, which in every case will yield a good result:—\r\n\r\n    Tin filings          40 parts\r\n    Sulphur              35   ”\r\n    Ammonium chloride    25   ”\r\n\r\nThe tin filings, which must be very fine, are well mixed in a mortar\r\nwith the sulphur and ammonium chloride. The heating is gradual at\r\nfirst; when the evolution of vapours has ceased the temperature is\r\nvery slowly increased to a dark red heat. The mosaic gold is found as\r\na yellow mass at the bottom of the vessel, but partly in crystalline\r\nscales on the walls and head of the retort.\r\n\r\nOther recipes are as follows:—\r\n\r\n    Tin dioxide          80 parts\r\n    Sulphur              60   ”\r\n    Ammonium chloride    30   ”\r\n\r\n    Tin filings          45   ”\r\n    Sulphur              35   ”\r\n    Ammonium chloride    25   ”\r\n\r\nIn all these cases the chief endeavour should be not to raise the\r\ntemperature too high; a dark red heat is sufficient to give a perfectly\r\nsatisfactory result.\r\n\r\nWhen metallic mercury is used, it is employed in the form of an amalgam\r\nwith tin, which is then in such a finely divided condition that it\r\nreadily enters into chemical combination with the sulphur. The amalgam\r\nis most simply obtained by heating 1 part of mercury almost to boiling,\r\nand stirring 2 parts of tin filings into the hot metal; 18 parts of\r\nthis amalgam mixed with 7 parts of sulphur and 6 of ammonium chloride\r\nare heated together.\r\n\r\nThe mosaic gold made after any of these methods may be used for gilding\r\ngold frames or as a painter’s pigment. Much so-called gold paint\r\nconsists of mosaic gold ground with a thick gum solution.\r\n\r\n=Chrysean.=—Wallach found that when a current of sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nwas passed through a saturated solution of potassium cyanide a\r\nprecipitate was formed, which had the formula C₄H₅N₃S₃. This substance,\r\nchrysean, is similar in appearance to mosaic gold; its technical\r\nemployment is prevented by its extremely poisonous nature and its high\r\ncost as compared with mosaic gold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nRED MINERAL PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERMILION.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful scarlet red pigment, which has been used for so long\r\na time, consists of mercuric sulphide, HgS. The same compound occurs\r\nready formed in nature as cinnabar; picked pieces of this mineral come\r\ninto the market under the name of mountain vermilion (_Bergzinnober_).\r\nA far larger quantity of vermilion is made artificially.\r\n\r\nMercuric sulphide exists in two forms—as a black non-crystalline\r\npowder and in the crystalline form, which is used as a pigment.\r\nEach modification may be transformed into the other by suitable\r\ntreatment, and each may pass into the other spontaneously under certain\r\nconditions. In the manufacture of vermilion, the black form of mercuric\r\nsulphide plays an important part; it is, therefore, necessary to give\r\nan account of the chemical behaviour of the two modifications before\r\nproceeding to an account of the method by which vermilion is made.\r\n\r\n=Black Mercuric Sulphide= may be obtained either by the direct union\r\nof metallic mercury with sulphur, or by precipitating the solution of\r\na mercuric salt with sulphuretted hydrogen. It is most simply formed\r\nby rubbing together equal parts of sulphur and mercury moistened with\r\nwater, until the mixture is uniformly black. It is, however, difficult\r\nin this way to convert all the mercury into sulphide. A better result\r\nis obtained when the mixture is moistened by ammonium sulphide instead\r\nof water. In this case the time required for the operation is shortened\r\nby warming the vessel. If the mortar is placed in hot water it is\r\ngenerally sufficient to grind for about two hours to bring about the\r\ncombination of the mercury and sulphur.\r\n\r\nThis compound can also be easily obtained by heating mercury with\r\nsulphur. In a vessel, placed under a chimney with a good draught, which\r\nis necessary to carry away the poisonous mercury vapours, 6 parts of\r\nthe metal are heated nearly to boiling and 1 part of sulphur added.\r\nCombination takes place at this temperature with a slight explosion,\r\nand pure mercuric sulphide results when the heating is continued until\r\nthe excess of sulphur is driven off.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of the manufacture of vermilion, black mercuric\r\nsulphide is most simply made by filling a thick-walled vessel with\r\nequal weights of mercury and sulphur, moistening the mixture with water\r\nand shaking or rotating the vessel for several hours. This can be done\r\neither in a rotating cylinder containing iron balls, or the vessel can\r\nbe fastened to any rotating object—to a water-wheel or to the fly-wheel\r\nof a steam-engine. The vessel in which the combination is effected\r\nshould of course not be quite full. It has been found that a more jerky\r\nmotion than that of rotation effects the combination of the mercury and\r\nsulphur in a shorter time. For example, an opportunity of fastening the\r\nvessel to a saw-mill would be of great advantage.\r\n\r\nThe mercuric sulphide made by the above methods is a velvety black\r\nmass, which, even when exactly equivalent weights of sulphur and\r\nmercury have been used, is never quite pure. Carbon bisulphide will\r\nalways extract a certain quantity of uncombined sulphur. The most\r\nimportant property of the black sulphide for the present purpose is\r\nthat it is changed into the crystalline modification by heating to the\r\ntemperature at which it volatilises. The sublimed mercuric sulphide has\r\nthe well-known fiery scarlet colour characteristic of vermilion.\r\n\r\n=Red Mercuric Sulphide=, or vermilion, exhibits, for a sulphur\r\ncompound, considerable resistance to the action of chemical reagents;\r\ndilute mineral acids do not decompose it. Unfortunately, vermilion has\r\nanother property which makes it quite unsuitable for the artist’s use:\r\nin the course of time it gradually turns dull and at last is completely\r\ndiscoloured. This alteration of colour can only be ascribed to a return\r\nof the red crystalline modification into the black non-crystalline.\r\nWhen a white pigment is tinted by vermilion it should not be a lead\r\npigment, or in a brief time it will turn black. A white pigment such\r\nas zinc white, which is not acted upon by sulphur compounds, should be\r\nused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF VERMILION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe red modification of mercuric sulphide can be prepared in the wet or\r\nthe dry way. The latter was formerly in general use, but at present the\r\nwet method is more generally employed, as it more easily and certainly\r\nproduces a handsome pigment. Each method has its advantages, and both\r\nwill be described.\r\n\r\n\r\n(a) DRY METHOD.\r\n\r\nThe numerous prescriptions which have been given for the manufacture\r\nof vermilion by the dry method are all founded on endeavours to\r\nconvert black mercuric sulphide into the red form. Many of these\r\nprescriptions contain directions for the soundness of which no reason\r\ncan be discovered, and it is not going too far to say that none exists,\r\nand that operations described as essential for the success of the\r\nprocess have been inserted merely to give the recipe the appearance\r\nof novelty. It cannot be denied that certain manipulations impart a\r\ngreater brilliancy to the product, although it is impossible to assign\r\na physical or chemical reason; but the manufacturer will quickly\r\nbe able to differentiate the valuable from the worthless in these\r\nprocesses. Two conditions have the greatest influence on the beauty of\r\nthe pigment—the temperature at which the black sulphide is sublimed,\r\nand the complete freedom of the vermilion from excess of sulphur. Of\r\nless importance is the repeated grinding of the vermilion; the oftener\r\nit is ground, the smaller the crystals become and the paler the shade.\r\n\r\nThe operation of grinding the pigment in ordinary mills is known\r\npractically as “preparing,” the extraction of excess of sulphur by\r\nboiling with alkaline liquids as “refining,” the product.\r\n\r\nThe usual process in Holland, especially in the Amsterdam works, is as\r\nfollows: The black sulphide is made by heating 270 parts of mercury\r\nwith 37·5 parts of sulphur in copper pans—the fire is so regulated that\r\nthe temperature is not high enough to ignite the sulphur. If properly\r\nprepared the product has now a pure black colour. It is immediately\r\nfinely ground and preserved in earthenware bottles containing only 0·7\r\nkilogramme each. It is sublimed from hemispherical vessels, provided\r\nwith iron covers carefully joined to the rim of the sublimation vessel\r\nby a suitable fire-resisting cement. Generally 3 such vessels are\r\ncontained in one furnace. The operation is commenced by heating them\r\nuntil the bottom shows a dark red heat. The temperature should now\r\nbe increased to such an extent that, when the contents of one of the\r\nabove-mentioned small bottles are poured into the vessel, a small flame\r\nonly appears; if on the contrary the contents burn explosively, the\r\ntemperature is too high, and further quantities of the black sulphide\r\nmust not be added until the vessels have cooled down to a certain\r\nextent. If, on introducing the first quantity of mercuric sulphide, a\r\nflame appears unaccompanied by an explosion, the contents of several of\r\nthe bottles may be introduced; the openings through which this addition\r\nis made are immediately closed by a well-fitting iron plate. From time\r\nto time this cover is raised and fresh quantities of mercuric sulphide\r\nadded. The operation lasts about 36 hours, when double the quantity of\r\nmercuric sulphide, made from the above mixture of mercury and sulphur,\r\nwill have been introduced into the 3 vessels. For the complete success\r\nof the process, the accurate regulation of the temperature to which\r\nthe vessels are exposed is particularly important; in practice, the\r\ntemperature is judged by the height of the flame which issues on\r\nremoving the iron plates: if this reaches to 1 metre the fire is too\r\nfierce, but if the flame is very small the fire must be increased.\r\nTowards the end of the sublimation the mass in the vessels is stirred\r\nabout every 15 minutes. As soon as the sublimation is finished the\r\nfire is extinguished. The vessels are broken when completely cold; the\r\nvermilion is then found in the upper portion as a sublimate of fibrous\r\ncharacter. The vermilion made by this process requires simply wet\r\ngrinding under ordinary mills and drying to be ready for market.\r\n\r\nIn the great mercury works at Idria, in Austria, vermilion is also\r\nmade from the black sulphide. The latter is made by mixing 84 parts\r\nof mercury with 16 parts of finely powdered sulphur in rotating\r\nvessels driven by water power, the operation lasting about 3 hours.\r\nThis quantity of sulphur is larger than is required to form mercuric\r\nsulphide; experience has shown that the combination takes place more\r\nrapidly when more than the equivalent quantity of sulphur is used.\r\nHeat is developed by the reaction and the temperature of the mixture\r\nrises to over 30° C. The black sulphide is then sublimed in cast-iron\r\nvessels, which are pear-shaped and built 6 together in a furnace; each\r\nholds a charge of 315 kilogrammes of black.\r\n\r\nSeveral periods are distinguished during the heating of the mass in\r\nthe sublimation vessels. The operation is commenced by heating 2 of\r\nthe vessels first. As soon as the vapours of sulphur, issuing from the\r\nneck of the vessels, take fire with explosion, the fire is made to\r\nheat the adjacent vessels. When the contents of all the vessels have\r\nexploded, the first part of the process known as the “evaporation” is\r\nat an end. Earthenware heads are then placed on the vessels and the\r\nfire is increased until the excess of sulphur present begins to distil;\r\nits vapours take fire in the air with a slight explosion. When this\r\ntakes place, earthenware receivers are attached which have only a small\r\nopening for the escape of uncondensed vapours. The sulphur condenses\r\nin these. When sulphur vapours are no longer given off in quantity,\r\nthe intermediate period (_stϋckperiode_) is finished and the real\r\nsublimation of the vermilion commences. The fire is now considerably\r\nincreased and the sublimed vermilion collects in the cooler parts of\r\nthe apparatus. When the sublimation is completely finished, small blue\r\nflames, which quickly vanish, appear at the joints of the apparatus.\r\nThe furnace is allowed to get quite cold, when the various parts of\r\nthe apparatus are taken apart, the vermilion deposited in the tubes\r\nis carefully removed, so that they may be again used, whilst the\r\nreceivers and head are broken, so that the vermilion they contain can\r\nbe collected.\r\n\r\nThe larger pieces form lump vermilion; the fragments of the receivers\r\nare cleaned with a wet brush to collect what adheres. The whole process\r\nof sublimation from the introduction of the black to the end lasts\r\nabout 7 hours.\r\n\r\nThe sublimed vermilion is ground in mills which differ little from\r\nordinary grinding mills. To prevent the formation of dust, water is\r\nadded and the stones are surrounded by wooden casings. The red paste\r\nfrom the mills, which is now known as vermilion, is then refined.\r\n\r\nThe refining consists in extracting the excess of sulphur by means of\r\nboiling potash solution; 300 kilogrammes of the ground vermilion are\r\nstirred up with water in a tub, the water is drawn off and the wet mass\r\nbrought into an iron pan, in which it is heated with 22·5 kilogrammes\r\nof potash lye for about 10 minutes. According to the composition of\r\nthe crude vermilion the lye has a strength of from 10° to 13° B. The\r\nsmaller the quantity of sulphur, the weaker is the potash solution; it\r\nis, or was, made in Idria in a very primitive manner, by extracting\r\nwood ashes. For vermilion of a bright red shade potash solution of 10°,\r\nfor the dark red of 11°, and for “Chinese vermilion” of 13° is used.\r\nThe excess of sulphur, together with a trace of mercuric sulphide,\r\ndissolves in the potash solution; the sulphur chiefly forms potassium\r\npentasulphide. When the boiling is finished, the vermilion is carefully\r\nwashed and dried in dishes placed in a heated furnace. During drying,\r\nthe vermilion agglomerates; finally the lumps are broken and sieved.\r\n\r\n=Chinese Vermilion= is in similar case to Indian ink. Both substances\r\nare in common use in Europe, they far surpass in quality our own\r\nmanufacture, and in neither case do we know the exact method by which\r\nthey are made. Genuine Chinese vermilion so far surpasses European in\r\nbrightness that it is bought at five or six times the price. It is\r\nsaid on unauthenticated authority to be made by subliming a mixture\r\nof 4 parts of quicksilver with 1 part of sulphur in earthenware pots\r\nclosed by an iron plate, which is kept constantly wet and serves as a\r\nreceiver, on which the vermilion deposits. The sublimed masses adhering\r\nto the lid are sorted, ground and repeatedly washed with water.\r\n\r\nAccording to Callum’s description of the manufacture of vermilion at\r\nHong Kong, mercury and sulphur are heated in a large iron pan, with\r\ncontinual stirring at about the melting point of sulphur (111° C.),\r\nuntil the whole has changed to a black mass. After cooling, this is\r\nmixed with water and mercury, the mixture thoroughly stirred, dried,\r\nplaced in a hemispherical dish and covered over with broken porcelain.\r\nA similar dish is cemented on the top of the first, and the dishes are\r\nheated for 16 hours; the vermilion adhering to the porcelain fragments\r\nis removed, wet ground and dried.\r\n\r\nA vermilion approaching Chinese in beauty is said to be obtained by\r\nmixing ordinary vermilion with 1 per cent. of antimony sulphide and\r\nagain subliming the mixture. The dark grey sublimate produces a reddish\r\nbrown powder, which is repeatedly boiled with a solution of “liver of\r\nsulphur” (potassium polysulphide), washed with water and digested for\r\na long time with hydrochloric acid. The author has repeatedly made\r\nvermilion by this process, but could never obtain a product differing\r\nappreciably from the original vermilion.\r\n\r\n\r\n(b) WET METHODS.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of vermilion in the wet way is founded on the\r\nconversion of metallic mercury or its compounds into mercuric sulphide\r\nby heating with alkaline sulphides, such as ammonium sulphide and liver\r\nof sulphur. The product always contains uncombined sulphur, which is\r\neliminated by treatment with alkalis.\r\n\r\nApart from the danger to the health of the workmen caused by the\r\npoisonous mercury vapours, which are present in rooms where mercury or\r\nits compounds are heated in apparatus even of the best construction,\r\nand which is not to be feared in a wet process, the vermilion prepared\r\nin the latter manner has a finer and brighter shade than that prepared\r\nby a dry process. The greater cost of the wet process is covered by the\r\nhigher value of the product.\r\n\r\nThe starting point of the wet method may be either metallic mercury,\r\nblack mercuric sulphide or another mercury salt. When metallic mercury\r\nis used, according to an old process, 100 parts are ground with 23\r\nparts of flowers of sulphur and a little caustic potash solution to\r\na homogeneous mass, which is then heated with a solution of 53 parts\r\nof caustic potash in an equal quantity of water, the evaporated water\r\nbeing continually replaced, until the colour changes from brownish-red\r\nto the fiery red of vermilion. When the colour approaches the desired\r\nshade a careful watch must be kept, and immediately the proper shade\r\nis obtained the heating must be stopped. If it is continued beyond\r\nthis point for but a short time, the vermilion at once loses its fire\r\nand cannot be again brightened. An interruption in the heating is\r\nequally harmful, a dull shade being produced. When the proper shade has\r\nappeared, the contents of the vessel are poured into a large quantity\r\nof water. The vermilion is then washed with dilute caustic potash and\r\nafterwards with water until the alkaline reaction disappears. It is\r\nfinally dried. The alkaline solutions obtained in this process contain\r\nconsiderable quantities of mercury in solution. They are collected, and\r\nwhen a sufficient quantity has accumulated the mercury is extracted.\r\n\r\nBarff recommends the following method: Mercury is rubbed with ⅙ to ⅕\r\nof its weight of sulphur until a uniform grey powder results. This is\r\nheated in a porcelain dish with caustic potash solution (133 parts of\r\npotash in 150 parts of water) at 45° C. until the powder has become\r\nbright red. Heating above 45° C. is to be avoided; it would impart a\r\nbrown tinge to the vermilion.\r\n\r\nA convenient process for making vermilion in the wet way is to first\r\nproduce the black sulphide in the dry way and then treat this with\r\nalkalis. Brunner’s method is founded on this procedure: 100 parts\r\nof mercury and 38 parts of sulphur are used to prepare the black\r\nsulphide. This is heated with a solution of 25 parts of caustic potash\r\nin 150 parts of water. The operation is best conducted in a vessel\r\nplaced in a water bath, the temperature of which does not exceed 45°\r\nC. After heating 7 to 8 hours, the mass begins to turn red, when the\r\nchange proceeds more quickly, and the greatest care must be taken\r\nnot to exceed the point at which the colour has reached its greatest\r\nbrilliance. As soon as the desired shade has appeared, the temperature\r\nof the water bath is lowered, but it is kept warm for several hours.\r\nCaustic solutions of different strengths produce different shades.\r\nThus, in order always to obtain the same product from the same\r\nquantities, it is necessary to replace the evaporated water at short\r\nintervals. In this process some quantity of mercury remains uncombined;\r\nit is separated from the vermilion by a process of levigation in the\r\nwashing.\r\n\r\n=Firmenich’s Method.=—Many wet methods for the manufacture of vermilion\r\ndiffer but little from the preceding. In Firmenich’s method the\r\nproduction of the black sulphide is united with the formation of\r\nvermilion in one operation.\r\n\r\nA solution of potassium sulphide of a certain strength is made by\r\nigniting 20 parts of potassium sulphate with 6 parts of coal, boiling\r\nthe mixture with 1·5 time the quantity of rain water, cooling the\r\nsolution, separating from the potassium sulphate which crystallises\r\nout, and boiling the solution with sulphur so long as it is dissolved.\r\nA mixture of 4·5 parts of this solution, 100 parts of mercury, and 2\r\nparts of sulphur is placed in flasks, which are subjected for several\r\nhours to a shaking or rocking motion. The liquid becomes greenish, and\r\nits temperature rises in consequence of the combination of mercury\r\nwith a portion of the sulphur of the potassium sulphide. The latter\r\nimmediately dissolves the free sulphur present, and again gives it\r\nup to the mercury, which in the course of a few hours is completely\r\nconverted into the black sulphide. The shaking is discontinued when\r\nthe contents of the flasks have acquired a deep brownish-red colour.\r\nThe flasks are then placed in a room heated to 45° C., and their\r\ncontents repeatedly shaken up. At this temperature the transformation\r\nof the black into the red mercuric sulphide is completed. The deposit\r\nin the flasks acquires more and more a scarlet shade. As soon as the\r\ncolour is found to have reached its greatest intensity the liquid\r\nis carefully poured off, and the vermilion treated with caustic soda\r\nsolution in order to dissolve free sulphur; it is then very carefully\r\nwashed.\r\n\r\nIn this process, the temperature at which the operation commences is\r\nimportant. The cooler the mixture which is placed in the flasks before\r\nshaking, the paler will be the colour of the vermilion obtained. It is\r\nto be supposed that the reaction, which is but slow in the cold, forms\r\nin consequence of its slowness a black sulphide of such character that\r\nin its subsequent transformation into the red crystalline sulphide very\r\nsmall crystals are produced.\r\n\r\nThe Gautier-Bouchart method for the preparation of vermilion from\r\nmercury and ammonium sulphide is applied on the large scale as follows:\r\n1,000 parts of mercury are shaken for 7 hours with 200 parts of flowers\r\nof sulphur and 400 parts of ammonium sulphide saturated with sulphur;\r\nthe dark-coloured mixture is exposed for several days to a temperature\r\nof 60° C., when the colour changes to red. In addition to the usual\r\nwashings, the mass is further treated with nitric acid. The purpose of\r\nthis operation is to oxidise all the free sulphur to sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nFor a colour works in which, in addition to vermilion, are made\r\nother pigments, especially such as are sensitive to the action of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, this process, which produces vermilion of a\r\ngood shade, although not particularly stable, is not to be recommended\r\non account of the evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen, which cannot be\r\ncompletely prevented even by the greatest care.\r\n\r\n=Liebig’s Process.=—The starting point in the manufacture of vermilion\r\nby this process is the compound known as white precipitate (see below).\r\nIt is only necessary to heat white precipitate with a solution of\r\nammonium sulphide saturated with sulphur, at 40° to 50° C., for a long\r\ntime. The operation may be conducted in well-closed flasks in a place\r\nthe temperature of which is, as nearly as possible, 45° to 50° C., such\r\nas the flues leading from a furnace in constant use. The change of\r\ncolour is gradual; this is an advantage, since it is easier to obtain\r\nthe correct shade. By treating the product with weak caustic potash\r\nsolution it may be made still brighter. After washing and drying at a\r\ngentle heat the pigment is finished.\r\n\r\nThis method is especially adapted for manufacturers not exclusively\r\nengaged in making vermilion. No special arrangement of apparatus is\r\nnecessary; the apparatus for making ammonium sulphide and a number of\r\nglass flasks are the only essentials. There is another considerable\r\nadvantage, that the product cannot be completely spoiled. The process\r\nof formation of the vermilion is tolerably slow; a careful observation\r\nof the progress of the earlier operations is sufficient to determine\r\nthe time required. In order to be able to do this with certainty, it is\r\nnecessary to work always under exactly the same conditions; the same\r\nquantity of white precipitate must always be used and the solution of\r\nammonium sulphide must always have the same strength.\r\n\r\n=Mercuric Ammonium Chloride, Infusible White Precipitate=,\r\nHgClNH₂.—This compound, which is required in the last-mentioned process\r\nfor the manufacture of vermilion, is most cheaply made in the following\r\nway: to a solution of 1 part of common salt in 32 parts of water, 2\r\nparts of dry mercuric sulphate are added in small quantities, whilst\r\nthoroughly stirring. It is absolutely necessary to work in this way,\r\nbecause mercuric sulphate is decomposed by water into free sulphuric\r\nacid and a basic salt, which is much more slowly converted into white\r\nprecipitate than the neutral salt. The liquid now contains mercuric\r\nchloride; on the addition of ammonia to alkaline reaction it gives a\r\nheavy white precipitate. The liquid is poured off and the precipitate\r\nwashed with water containing a little ammonia, until the washings\r\ngive only a slight turbidity with barium chloride. This process may\r\nalso be commenced with mercuric chloride, but the above method is\r\ncheaper. White precipitate should volatilise without fusing when heated\r\non platinum foil and should keep its white colour when treated with\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\n=Electrolytic Process.=—In a wooden vessel 1 metre in diameter and\r\n2 metres deep are placed, at the sides, dishes 15 centimetres wide,\r\ncontaining a layer of mercury 1 centimetre deep. These dishes are\r\nconnected with the positive pole of a dynamo. The negative pole is\r\nconnected to an iron plate, electrolytically coated by copper, placed\r\nat the bottom of the vessel, which is filled with a solution containing\r\n8 per cent. of ammonium nitrate and 8 per cent. of sodium nitrate. A\r\nregular current of sulphur dioxide is introduced through a perforated\r\ncoil. The excess of gas escapes by a tube in the cover. When the\r\ncurrent is passed a precipitate of red mercuric sulphide is at once\r\nformed. Attempts have been made to dispense with the current of sulphur\r\ndioxide. The bath then contains 100 litres of water and 8 kilogrammes\r\neach of ammonium nitrate, sodium nitrate, sodium sulphide and sulphur.\r\nUnder these conditions it is only necessary to add sulphur and mercury\r\nin order to obtain, at the end of the operation, vermilion which is in\r\nno way inferior to that made by the first process.\r\n\r\nVermilion is frequently grossly adulterated by cheaper pigments.\r\nSubstances are often found under the name of vermilion which contain no\r\ntrace of mercury, but consist of bright orange lead mixed with a few\r\nper cent. of ferric oxide, and having a deceptive similarity in colour\r\nto the best vermilion.\r\n\r\n=Mercuric Iodide.=—When corrosive sublimate solution is precipitated\r\nwith exactly the necessary quantity of potassium iodide, mercuric\r\niodide is obtained as a scarlet precipitate which surpasses in beauty\r\neven the best samples of vermilion. Unfortunately, this substance\r\ncannot be used as an artists’ colour. Exposure to light soon turns it\r\nbrown and finally black. It appears to be unaltered in the dark; the\r\nauthor possesses a sample which has been so kept for 30 years without\r\nlosing its shade in any way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nANTIMONY VERMILION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntimony vermilion is a red pigment which will bear comparison in\r\nfineness of shade with mercury vermilion, over which it has the\r\nadvantage of cheapness. In composition it is antimony trisulphide,\r\nSb₂S₃. This compound is obtained by precipitating a solution of\r\nantimony trichloride with sulphuretted hydrogen. However, the\r\nprecipitate, which is a very fine red whilst wet, loses its colour in\r\ndrying, and the product is almost worthless as a pigment.\r\n\r\nIn another way it can be obtained in such a condition that it loses\r\nnothing of its beauty in drying, but retains its brilliance. Böttger\r\ngives the following process: a solution of antimony trichloride is\r\nmixed with a solution of sodium hyposulphite (thiosulphate) and the\r\nliquid heated so long as a precipitate forms, which is then washed on\r\na filter with water containing acetic acid. If pure water were used\r\nfor washing, the antimony chloride still present would be decomposed,\r\nforming the white oxychloride, which would detract from the shade of\r\nthe antimony vermilion. In this process particular regard is to be paid\r\nto the use of exact quantities of materials. The finest product is\r\nobtained when 2 parts of a solution of antimony trichloride, which has\r\nexactly the specific gravity 1·35, are mixed with a solution of 3 parts\r\nof sodium hyposulphite in 6 parts of water.\r\n\r\nAccording to R. Wagner, antimony vermilion is obtained by dissolving\r\n4 parts of tartar emetic and 3 parts of tartaric acid in 18 parts of\r\nwater, heating to 60° C., mixing with a solution of sodium hyposulphite\r\n(thiosulphate) and heating to 90° C. The precipitate is then carefully\r\nwashed and dried.\r\n\r\nPure antimony vermilion closely approaches, as we have said, ordinary\r\nvermilion in shade, and for a sulphur compound shows a remarkable\r\nresistance towards chemical reagents. By dilute acids, ammonia and\r\nalkaline carbonates, it is attacked only on long continued contact, but\r\nit is easily decomposed by very dilute hydrochloric acid and by caustic\r\nalkalis. A mixture with white lead keeps for a long time, but there\r\ncan be no question of the permanence of such a mixture, in consequence\r\nof the oft-repeated properties of lead pigments. Antimony vermilion is\r\nwell adapted for oil painting. When ground with oil it exhibits a red\r\nof a brilliance in no way inferior to that of genuine vermilion. It may\r\nalso be used as a water colour, but is not adapted for fresco work,\r\nsince it is quickly decomposed by lime.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these favourable properties antimony vermilion has so\r\nfar been little used. Considering the small cost of its preparation,\r\nespecially when calcium hyposulphite, which gives an equally good\r\nresult, is used in place of the sodium salt, its use is to be\r\nrecommended in the place of mercury vermilion. It appears as if the\r\nhigh price demanded for this substance by several manufacturers has\r\nprevented its general employment.\r\n\r\n=Appendix. Antimony Blue.=—This fine blue pigment can be prepared by\r\nthe addition of a dilute solution of potassium ferrocyanide to a clear\r\nsolution of antimony in _aqua regia_. According to Krauss, it contains\r\nno antimony as colouring principle, but is a Prussian blue obtained\r\nfrom the ferrocyanide, which is decomposed by the strong acid, with\r\nevolution of hydrocyanic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nFERRIC OXIDE PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pigments composed of ferric oxide are used in enormous quantity.\r\nThey are distinguished by a high degree of permanence. Large deposits\r\nof ferric oxide occur in nature, and in places where it is found in\r\nconsiderable quantity iron is manufactured from it on the spot. Several\r\nvarieties of natural ferric oxide are distinguished: specular iron ore\r\nforms crystalline masses of brilliant lustre; another variety in small\r\ncrystals is called iron glance; micaceous iron ore consists of shining\r\nscales; red hæmatite has the appearance of bundles of fibres; an earthy\r\nvariety of hæmatite is also common.\r\n\r\nThe compound of ferric oxide with water, ferric hydroxide, is still\r\nmore abundant than hæmatite; brown hæmatite, limonite and other iron\r\nores consist essentially of this compound. The pigment known as ochre\r\nis also ferric hydrate.\r\n\r\nVery pure red hæmatite has so fine a red colour that it may often be\r\nused as a pigment after grinding or levigating. The famous red of\r\nPompeii, which has been found on the ruined walls of the town, still\r\nshows, after eighteen centuries’ exposure to damp, the brightest\r\nshade, certainly a striking proof of the extraordinary permanence of\r\nthis pigment. Considering its great permanence, its easy preparation,\r\nand its low price, it is surprising that ferric oxide is not more\r\nextensively used by artists than it is at present. It is used,\r\nhowever, extensively in colouring earthenware, for which purpose\r\nits stability at high temperatures makes it suitable. Principally on\r\naccount of its cheapness it is largely used in ordinary painting, but\r\nfor artistic purposes it is not used to the extent it deserves.\r\n\r\nEvery colour maker well knows that artists justly complain that\r\nthe pigments offered to them have generally but a small degree of\r\npermanence. They are surprised that the paintings of the old masters\r\nshow now, after the lapse of centuries, their colours unaltered, whilst\r\nthe pigments manufactured at the present day, instead of corresponding\r\nto the high standard of chemical knowledge, are often discoloured\r\nwithin a few months after use. But it was just the restricted knowledge\r\nof chemistry which the ancients possessed which compelled them to\r\nmake extensive use of the permanent earth pigments, to which class of\r\npermanent colours ferric oxide belongs. The advances of science have\r\nsucceeded in preparing ferric oxide, not only as a red pigment, but in\r\nthe different shades of red, from yellow to brown and deep violet, all\r\nconsisting entirely of pure ferric oxide. Ferric oxide has the property\r\nof altering its molecular condition on protracted heating; this change\r\nis accompanied by an alteration in colour. If ferric oxide is heated\r\nfor a very long time at the highest temperatures its colour changes at\r\nlast to black.\r\n\r\nFerric oxide can be prepared by different methods for artists’\r\npurposes. The process by which it is made is not unimportant. Either\r\nferrous or ferric salts can be employed as the raw material. With\r\nthe latter, pure ferric oxide is at once formed, or hydroxide, which\r\nis converted into oxide by heating. The ferrous salts are generally\r\ncheaper than ferric salts; they are therefore commonly used for the\r\npreparation of ferric oxide, as well as of the other iron pigments.\r\nEven in combination with the strongest acids, ferrous oxide has but\r\nlittle stability; when separated from its salts as ferrous hydroxide,\r\nthe greatest precautions must be taken to obtain it pure; in contact\r\nwith the air it at once takes up oxygen and changes to ferric\r\nhydroxide. Ferrous carbonate shows this same degree of instability; the\r\nnatural substance, occurring in large crystals as spathic ironstone, is\r\nno exception: on exposure to the air it is gradually changed to ferric\r\noxide.\r\n\r\nThere is another reason for the advisability of using ferrous salts to\r\nprepare ferric oxide. When ferric hydroxide is made by precipitating\r\nthe solution of a ferric salt with ammonia or caustic potash, the least\r\nexcess of the precipitant unites with the hydroxide to form a compound\r\nwhich is only decomposed by long washing with water. The precipitate\r\nis, however, gelatinous, and consequently very difficult to wash.\r\n\r\nIn order to prepare ferric oxide suitable for an artists’ pigment the\r\nfollowing process may be used: 17 parts of soda are dissolved in 68\r\nparts of water; the solution is boiled in an iron pan, and 10 parts\r\nof crystallised ferrous sulphate are added in small quantities with\r\ncontinual stirring. The boiling and stirring are continued until\r\nthe green vitriol has completely dissolved, when the greenish white\r\nprecipitate is allowed to settle, washed several times with water,\r\nand then exposed to the air in thin layers. The precipitate, which\r\nbegins to turn yellow during washing, becomes in a short time ochre\r\nyellow in the air, being changed into ferric hydroxide. After drying\r\nand calcining, a fine red powder of pure ferric oxide is formed. The\r\nshade depends on the temperature at which the substance is calcined:\r\nthe higher the temperature and the longer the heating is continued, the\r\ndarker is the product.\r\n\r\n=Vogel’s Iron Red.=—This preparation, which is particularly brilliant\r\nand therefore highly suitable for an artists’ colour, is made by\r\nadding a saturated solution of oxalic acid to a boiling solution of\r\ngreen vitriol. The greenish yellow precipitate of ferrous oxalate is\r\ncollected on a filter and well washed with water. After drying, the\r\nprecipitate is heated in a shallow iron dish to a temperature of 200°\r\nC., at which the ferrous oxalate decomposes and is converted into a\r\nsoft fiery red powder consisting of pure ferric oxide. By igniting this\r\npowder in covered crucibles the different shades of ferric oxide can be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n=Macay’s English Red.=—Seven hundred and four parts of ferrous\r\nsulphate, 1,000 parts of copper chloride, and 1,678 parts of common\r\nsalt are dissolved, the solution boiled and the precipitate ignited.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of fuming or Nordhausen sulphuric acid, ferric oxide\r\nis obtained as a residue. It is then known under the names of English\r\nred, _caput mortuum_, colcothar, rouge and Indian red as a very cheap\r\npigment. It is also used as a polishing material. Fuming sulphuric acid\r\nis made by heating green vitriol at a white heat in retorts placed\r\nin furnaces; sulphur dioxide and trioxide are evolved, whilst in the\r\nretorts there remains a residue of almost pure ferric oxide, containing\r\nsmall quantities of basic ferric sulphate, which can only be decomposed\r\nby long continued violent heating. The vapours of sulphur trioxide are\r\ncaught in receivers containing oil of vitriol, in which they dissolve\r\nand produce fuming sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nThe residue in the retorts, which has only a low commercial value,\r\ncan be converted into a good pigment without the expenditure of much\r\nmoney or labour. It is ground in mills as finely as possible, and,\r\nif necessary, afterwards levigated. The fine powder is mixed with\r\nvarying quantities of common salt, the object of which is to prevent\r\nthe temperature from rising too high in the calcining process. Common\r\nsalt is volatile at a temperature approaching a strong red heat; when\r\nthe temperature has once risen so far, a further rise is prevented by\r\nthe heat taken up in volatilising the salt. In order to make ferric\r\noxide of a yellow tinge, 2 per cent. of salt are added, and the mixture\r\nheated with a moderate fire for 1 hour. To obtain the deeper shades,\r\nthe addition of common salt is increased even to 6 per cent. For a\r\nbrownish-red oxide, 4 per cent. of salt are added and the mixture\r\nheated for 4 hours; for a dark violet oxide, 6 per cent. of salt are\r\nused, and the mixture is heated for 6 hours with the fiercest fire.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that the shade of the product is finer the more\r\ncompletely air is excluded from the glowing mass and the more quickly\r\nthe product, after sufficient heating, is cooled down to the ordinary\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nFire-clay tubes are used for heating the ferric oxide, which are\r\nsimilar to gas retorts, and are built one above the other in furnaces.\r\nThe number in one furnace may reach 60. Each retort is closed by a\r\nwell-fitting lid, which is luted with clay after the retorts are\r\nfilled, a small opening being left through which the heated air may\r\nescape. If the retorts were closed completely air-tight they would\r\nburst on heating.\r\n\r\nFerric oxide pigments are made in very large quantity by several works,\r\nwhich bring up to 20 different shades, varying from reddish yellow to\r\ndark violet, into the market.\r\n\r\nOn account of their great resistance to the action of the atmosphere\r\nand of chemical agents, the ferric oxide pigments are particularly\r\nsuitable for painting iron and other metals which are exposed to air or\r\nwater. They are also suited to fresco work.\r\n\r\nLower qualities of iron reds are made by calcining ochres, large\r\ndeposits of which occur in nature, and also from the residues of basic\r\nferric sulphate obtained in the alum manufacture. These varieties\r\nare at the best usable for ordinary painting, but never for artists’\r\npigments.\r\n\r\nAccording to the method of Steinau, iron pigments can be made from\r\nwrought-iron scraps, turnings, etc., by causing them to rust through\r\nalternate contact with air and water. The resulting ferric hydrate is\r\neither at once used as a pigment or converted into other shades by\r\ncalcining. By heating in the air a red pigment is formed; by heating\r\nwith coal in the absence of air a black; and from mixtures of red and\r\nblack different shades of brown. If the iron turnings can be obtained\r\ncheap, this process should be well adapted to the manufacture of fine\r\niron pigments.\r\n\r\n=Indian Red= consists of ferric oxide. It was originally obtained from\r\na very pure hæmatite, occurring in India, by grinding and levigating.\r\nIt can, however, also be artificially made, in shades varying between\r\nbright red and dark brownish-red, by heating pure ferric oxide. This\r\nvaluable pigment is extremely brilliant and durable.\r\n\r\nThe darkest brownish-red shades can be obtained from Indian red by\r\nmixing it with varying quantities of litharge, and heating the mixture\r\nvery strongly in a covered crucible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nOTHER RED MINERAL PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chrome Red or Chrome Vermilion.=—Under the most varied names, chrome\r\norange, Persian red, Derby red, Chinese red, Indian red, chrome\r\nvermilion, etc., there occur in commerce numerous pigments, orange to\r\ndark red in colour, which can all be made from neutral lead chromate.\r\nWhen this salt, _i.e._, ordinary chrome yellow, is treated with\r\nsmaller or larger quantities of a strong base, such as caustic potash\r\nor caustic soda, “basic” lead chromates are formed, which exhibit a\r\nmore intense red shade the more lead they contain. These compounds can\r\nbe made either by adding caustic potash to the solution of potassium\r\nchromate used for making the chrome, or the precipitated chrome yellow\r\nmay be treated with caustic potash. The latter process readily yields\r\ngood results, so that it is generally followed.\r\n\r\nRecent researches have shown that differences in the shade of chrome\r\nred are due to the varying size of the single microscopic crystals\r\nof which it consists. When chrome reds of the most different shades\r\nare ground the powder has almost the same colour. The larger are the\r\ncrystals the deeper is the shade of the red, so that the art of making\r\ndeep chrome red lies in working so as to produce large crystals.\r\n\r\nAs was said in describing the preparation of chrome yellow, the lead\r\nliquors used in its manufacture contain varying quantities of acetic\r\nacid, which affect the shade of the product. The quantities of caustic\r\npotash necessary to turn a certain quantity of chrome yellow into\r\nchrome red of a certain shade can, therefore, only be estimated from\r\ntime to time in an empirical manner. This estimation may be performed\r\nby the method of Habich with great certainty. The precipitate of chrome\r\nyellow is made in the ordinary way, and well washed 6 to 8 times.\r\nEqual portions of the paste are brought into vessels of equal height\r\nand diameter. To the first of these portions caustic soda solution of\r\na certain strength is added; to the second rather stronger caustic\r\nsoda solution; in each succeeding vessel the strength of the solution\r\nis increased to a known extent. After the addition of caustic soda\r\nthe vessels are energetically shaken. They are then set aside for the\r\nprecipitate to settle in a place completely free from vibration. In\r\none of the vessels, an orange or red shade will be seen very similar\r\nto that it is desired to make. Now, it is known how much caustic soda\r\nsolution of a certain strength has been added to this quantity of\r\ncolour, so that the quantity necessary for the whole of the chrome\r\nyellow precipitate may be found by a simple calculation. In working on\r\nthe large scale, the process is exactly the same as in the preliminary\r\ntest; the calculated amount of caustic soda solution is added to the\r\nprecipitate in the tub, it is well stirred, and left at rest for some\r\nhours. When the proper shade appears, the liquid above the precipitate,\r\nwhich contains sodium chromate in proportion to the strength of the\r\ncaustic soda solution used, can be drawn off and used to precipitate\r\nfresh lead acetate solution. The precipitate is washed first in the tub\r\nand then on the strainers.\r\n\r\nSince, as has been said, the depth of colour depends upon the size of\r\nthe single crystals, care should be taken in washing the precipitate\r\nnot to agitate it too vigorously, or the pigment will lose in depth by\r\nthe breakage of a large number of crystals.\r\n\r\nSpecial formulæ for the manufacture of chrome red are abundant, but if\r\nthe above process be followed they are superfluous, and it is only for\r\nthe sake of completeness that one or two are given. Deep chrome red is\r\nmade by the action of 25 parts of caustic soda on 100 parts of pure\r\nchrome yellow.\r\n\r\nA noteworthy process is due to Liebig. Saltpetre is melted in a\r\ncrucible, and heated to a temperature below that at which oxygen is\r\nevolved. Dry chrome yellow is introduced so long as effervescence\r\noccurs; the fused mass appears, whilst liquid, deep black. As soon as\r\nit is in quiet fusion it is poured on a cold plate. In consequence of\r\nthe rapid cooling it becomes brittle and can be easily powdered. The\r\nhot mass is broken up and boiled with water, potassium chromate going\r\ninto solution. The chrome red made by this process is little inferior\r\nin brilliance to vermilion.\r\n\r\nAccording to Prinveault a handsome chrome red is obtained by treating\r\n25 grammes of neutral lead carbonate with 10 grammes of yellow\r\npotassium chromate dissolved in 5 litres of water, boiling for half\r\nan hour, washing the violet precipitate, and finally treating with 1\r\ngramme of sulphuric acid diluted with 100 grammes of water.\r\n\r\n=Cobalt Red= consists of cobalt phosphate. It was first recommended\r\nby Salvetat. It is obtained by precipitating a solution of a cobalt\r\nsalt by sodium phosphate. After drying at the ordinary temperature the\r\nprecipitate has a beautiful rose-red colour. By careful heating, the\r\nshade becomes more violet according to the temperature used.\r\n\r\n=Cobalt-Magnesia Red.=—When magnesia is moistened with the solution\r\nof a cobalt salt and strongly heated, a rose-red mass is obtained\r\nwhich can be used as an extremely durable artists’ colour. It probably\r\nconsists of a compound of cobalt oxide with magnesia. The method of\r\npreparation is as follows: Magnesium carbonate is mixed to a thin paste\r\nwith a dilute solution of cobalt nitrate; this is heated and stirred\r\nuntil quite dry, when the residue is strongly heated in a covered\r\ncrucible. In the manufacture of this and other cobalt pigments it is of\r\nparticular importance to prevent the entry of the fire gases into the\r\ncrucible. Unless this is done a product of good colour is not obtained.\r\n\r\n=Cobalt Arsenate.=—By precipitating a cobalt salt with sodium arsenate,\r\na violet-red precipitate is obtained which leaves a fine durable red on\r\nheating. The mineral erythrite has a similar composition and colour.\r\nThis pigment has a bright shade, is permanent, and although it contains\r\narsenic is not particularly poisonous, since after fusion it is little\r\nsoluble.\r\n\r\n=Chromium Stannate.=—This artists’ pigment, which may be used in oil\r\nand porcelain painting, is made in the following manner (Gentele): 1\r\nkilogramme of tin is converted by strong nitric acid into metastannic\r\nacid, 50 grammes of potassium chromate are dissolved in 1 litre of\r\nwater, the solution mixed with 2 kilogrammes of chalk and 1 kilogramme\r\nof powdered quartz, and finally with the metastannic acid. The mixture\r\nis dried and strongly heated. The temperature must be raised to a white\r\nheat, at which the mass sinters and acquires a dark rose-red colour. It\r\nis then completely extracted with boiling water, when a fine powder is\r\nleft.\r\n\r\nThis pigment, which is known in the market as “pink colour,” may be\r\nused with advantage in oil painting in the place of rose madder lake,\r\nover which it has the advantage in durability.\r\n\r\n=Silver Chromate.=—A solution of silver nitrate gives, with potassium\r\nchromate, a deep red precipitate of silver chromate, which is\r\noccasionally used as an artists’ pigment under the name of “purple\r\nred”. Not only is the price of this pigment high, but it has little\r\ndurability, since, like all silver compounds, it is acted upon by\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen and turned dark, owing to the formation of black\r\nsilver sulphide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nPURPLE OF CASSIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPurple of Cassius, or gold purple, is not a pigment for painters’ use;\r\nit is employed for colouring glass, for porcelain painting and for\r\ncoloured glazes. For these last purposes we know nothing which can\r\ncompletely replace purple of Cassius, so that its preparation will be\r\ndescribed here. Its costliness prevents its general use.\r\n\r\nAs regards the chemical constitution of purple of Cassius very diverse\r\nviews are held. Chemists have not yet succeeded in explaining it;\r\nsome regard it as aurous stannate, others as stannic acid, in which a\r\nparticular form of gold of a red colour is contained in an extremely\r\nfinely divided condition. There are reasonable grounds for both\r\nopinions. Theoretical considerations are of little interest to the\r\nmanufacturer, who is chiefly interested in the method by which he can\r\nprepare a product which satisfies the demands of the consumer.\r\n\r\nPurple of Cassius has been known for nearly two hundred years,\r\nhence there are many formulas for its preparation. Before these are\r\nenumerated it is necessary to give an account of the conditions under\r\nwhich this substance is formed. In order to obtain gold purple,\r\na solution is required which contains both stannous and stannic\r\nchlorides; if this solution is mixed with a very dilute solution of\r\ngold chloride a precipitate is obtained which is generally brownish\r\nred, and only acquires its fine red shade on igniting. The colour\r\nshown by the purple after precipitation is no guide to the shade of\r\nthe finished product; a purple which shows a very fine colour whilst\r\nwet often produces a pigment of much less beauty than an actually\r\nugly precipitate. These differences are to be ascribed to the varying\r\nmolecular condition of the purple, for the different varieties show\r\nvery small differences in chemical composition.\r\n\r\nAccording to the directions of Fuchs, a fine purple is obtained by\r\nmixing a solution of stannous chloride with sufficient ferric chloride\r\nsolution to give the mixture a green colour. Part of the ferric salt is\r\nthen reduced to ferrous salt, whilst the stannous chloride is partially\r\noxidised. At the same time a solution of gold chloride is made; this\r\nmust be quite free from nitric acid and contain 1 part of the salt in\r\n400 to 500 parts of water. The tin solution is added drop by drop to\r\nthe gold solution with constant stirring; the mixture becomes turbid,\r\nbut the precipitate requires a long time to settle on account of its\r\nfine state of division. The depth of colour shown by the purple varies\r\naccording to the strength of the solutions.\r\n\r\nM. Müller states that the following process gives the best results: The\r\nquantity of stannic chloride equivalent to 9 grammes of stannic acid\r\nis dissolved in 200 cubic centimetres of water; potassium carbonate\r\nis added to alkaline reaction, then 1 gramme of gold in the form of\r\nchloride. Grape sugar is added to the mixture, which is made up to 300\r\ncubic centimetres by water, and warmed until the brightest shade is\r\nreached. When a very gelatinous mass is formed after the addition of\r\nthe potassium carbonate it is heated for a short time before adding the\r\ngold solution and grape sugar.\r\n\r\nWächter gives directions for obtaining pale and deep shades. To obtain\r\nthe pale purple 5 grammes of tin are dissolved in _aqua regia_, the\r\nsolution evaporated to dryness on the water bath, the solid residue\r\nmixed with a solution of 2 grammes of stannous chloride and dissolved\r\nin 10 litres of water. To this liquid is added a solution of 0·5\r\ngramme of gold in _aqua regia_, and immediately 50 grammes of ammonia\r\nto neutralise free acid. The precipitate separates spontaneously from\r\nthe dark red liquid; its formation may be hastened by adding sulphuric\r\nacid. The washed precipitate is mixed whilst moist by means of a\r\nsilver spatula with 20 grammes of lead flux, 2 grammes of red lead, 1\r\ngramme of quartz sand, and 1 gramme of calcined borax. The mixture is\r\nthen dried; it produces a purple red colour. If 3 grammes of silver\r\ncarbonate are added, a clean, pale purple pigment results.\r\n\r\nThe deep purple is made by mixing a solution of 0·5 gramme of gold\r\nin 10 litres of water with 7·5 grammes of stannous chloride solution\r\n(specific gravity, 1·7) whilst stirring, and adding a few drops of\r\nsulphuric acid. The washed precipitate is mixed with 10 grammes of lead\r\nflux and 0·5 gramme of silver carbonate.\r\n\r\nA rose-red shade of gold purple is obtained by dissolving 1 gramme\r\nof gold and mixing the solution simultaneously with solutions of 50\r\ngrammes of alum in 20 litres of water, and of 1·5 gramme of stannous\r\nchloride (specific gravity, 1·7). Ammonia is now added until all the\r\nalumina is precipitated. In order to prepare from the dried precipitate\r\nthe mixture which will produce the colour on fusion, it is mixed with\r\n50 grammes of lead flux and 2·5 grammes of silver carbonate.\r\n\r\n=Magnesia Gold Purple.=—According to M. Müller, the colour of gold\r\npurple is produced by covering the particles of a very finely divided\r\nwhite substance with metallic gold. Thus, when calcined magnesia is\r\nstirred up with water, gold chloride solution added, and the mixture\r\nwarmed to 100° C., the gold is precipitated upon the magnesia; the wet,\r\nyellow powder acquires a reddish shade on drying, which at a red heat\r\nbecomes so beautiful a carmine-red that it surpasses purple of Cassius\r\nin fineness of shade. A purple which contains 20 grammes of gold as\r\nchloride to 84 grammes of magnesia has the most pure carmine tint; the\r\nshade varies with the proportion of gold to magnesia. The different\r\nshades of purple contain the following percentages of gold:—\r\n\r\n    _Percentage of Gold._      _Shade of the Purple._\r\n            33·5              Brownish-red (excess of gold).\r\n            25·0              Deep carmine-red.\r\n            20·0              Medium carmine-red.\r\n            10·0              Pale carmine.\r\n             5·0              A good rose-red.\r\n             3·0              Rose-red.\r\n             1·0              Pale rose.\r\n             0·2              Delicate rose.\r\n             0·1              Appreciable red tint.\r\n\r\n=Alumina Gold Purple= is obtained, according to Müller, by adding\r\ngold chloride and excess of potassium carbonate to alum solution and\r\nboiling. The purple obtained in this way is as deep in colour with 10\r\nper cent. of gold as a magnesia purple with 20 per cent. of gold, but\r\nhas a more bluish violet shade. If, in the preparation of purple, the\r\nalumina is precipitated by potassium carbonate and the gold chloride\r\nreduced by grape sugar, a different shade of purple is obtained to that\r\nin the precipitation of which ammonia is used. The alumina gold purple\r\nis specially adapted for the production of porcelain enamels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nBLUE MINERAL PIGMENTS—IRON-CYANOGEN PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pigments occurring in commerce under the names of Prussian,\r\nChinese, Berlin or Paris blue consist, when pure, of ferric\r\nferrocyanide, Fe₄[Fe(CN)₆]₃. This compound is obtained as a deep blue\r\nprecipitate when yellow prussiate (potassium ferrocyanide) is mixed\r\nwith the solution of a ferric salt.\r\n\r\nThe precipitate shows certain differences in composition according\r\nto the exact method by which it is obtained. A different result is\r\nobtained when the solution of the ferric salt is poured into that\r\nof a ferrocyanide, to that produced by the reverse procedure, the\r\nprecipitate produced in the one case has properties which it does not\r\npossess in the other. Similar differences often occur in precipitating\r\npigments.\r\n\r\nIf the solution of the ferrocyanide is poured into the iron solution,\r\nthe latter being in excess, an insoluble precipitate is formed; but if\r\nthe iron solution is poured into the ferrocyanide solution of which an\r\nexcess is present, the blue precipitate is formed, but it is soluble\r\nin pure water, though not in water containing salts. Thus when this\r\nprecipitate is separated from the liquid and washed, the washings are\r\nat first quite colourless and remain so whilst salts are present, but\r\nwhen these have been completely washed away, a fine blue solution of\r\nthe ferric ferrocyanide is formed, from which the addition of a salt\r\nsolution again separates the dissolved Prussian blue.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to the manufacture of Prussian blue on the large\r\nscale, it is necessary to consider the behaviour of ferrous salts\r\ntowards yellow prussiate, since these are commonly used instead of\r\nferric salts. When a solution of potassium ferrocyanide is mixed with\r\na solution of a ferrous salt, there is formed a pure white precipitate\r\nof potassium ferrous ferrocyanide, K₂FeFe(CN)₆. In order to obtain a\r\ncompletely white precipitate, it is necessary that the ferrous salt\r\nshould be completely free from ferric salts and that the solutions\r\nshould contain no dissolved oxygen; the solutions would therefore\r\nhave to be boiled before mixing. If one of the solutions contains the\r\nsmallest quantity of oxygen a bluish precipitate is formed. When the\r\nwhite precipitate of potassium ferrous ferrocyanide is exposed to the\r\nair it immediately acquires at the surface a dark blue colour, and is\r\ncompletely changed to Prussian blue by sufficiently long contact with\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this behaviour of ferrous and ferric salts different\r\nmethods may be used to obtain Prussian blue. Either the process is\r\ncommenced with a ferric salt from which a precipitate of Prussian blue\r\nis at once obtained, or the solution of a ferrous salt is converted\r\ninto ferric salt by a powerful oxidising agent, such as chlorine or\r\nnitric acid, or a solution of a ferrous salt is precipitated with\r\nyellow prussiate and the white or bluish precipitate, which consists\r\nchiefly of potassium ferrous ferrocyanide, converted into ferric\r\nferrocyanide or Prussian blue by treatment with nitric acid.\r\n\r\nPrussian blue is also known, as we have said, as Chinese blue, Berlin\r\nblue and Paris blue; Brunswick blue or mineral blue is another form.\r\nGenerally the product under the name of Chinese or Paris blue,\r\nwhich has an intense dark blue colour, is quite pure, whilst under\r\nthe names of Prussian blue and Berlin blue mixtures with starch or\r\nalumina are included, which consequently have a more or less pale\r\ncolour. The pigments known as mineral or Brunswick blue are the\r\nleast valuable, they have generally a less deep colour and are quite\r\nwithout the metallic lustre which distinguishes Chinese blue and the\r\nbetter varieties of Prussian blue. Mineral blue often contains very\r\nlarge quantities of alumina, chalk, or even barytes; the addition of\r\nthe last is to be regarded as irrational, since it makes the pigment\r\nconspicuously heavy.\r\n\r\n=Chinese Blue.=—Pure Chinese blue appears in the form of deep blue\r\nmasses, characterised by a peculiar metallic lustre, which is\r\nespecially marked when the surface of a lump is rubbed with the finger\r\nnail. This metallic lustre is accompanied by a copper-red shimmer\r\nwhich is similar to that exhibited by fine indigo. In large pieces\r\npure Chinese blue appears very dark by artificial light; it possesses\r\nenormous strength of colour. The following test serves for the\r\nrecognition of the complete purity of Chinese blue: A small quantity\r\nis powdered and rubbed in a thin layer on white paper; if the metallic\r\nlustre shows in undiminished strength the blue may be regarded as quite\r\npure, for Chinese blue quickly loses this property by additions of\r\nother substances.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said above concerning the different behaviour of\r\nferrous and ferric salts, the simplest method of making Chinese blue\r\nwould be to precipitate the solution of a ferric salt with yellow\r\nprussiate, keeping the ferric salt in excess, to wash and dry the\r\nprecipitate. Ferric salts are, however, dearer than ferrous salts, so\r\nthat the latter are generally used.\r\n\r\nIn making Chinese blue from a ferrous salt ferrous sulphate or green\r\nvitriol is generally taken. This salt is dissolved in water; it is\r\nadvisable to add a small quantity of sulphuric acid, since the water\r\nwill contain carbonates, which produce ferrous carbonate. Air oxidises\r\nthe latter to ferric hydroxide, which is brown, and if present even\r\nin small quantity will spoil the shade of the blue. This addition of\r\nsulphuric acid is of special importance when the white precipitate\r\nproduced by the prussiate solution is to be oxidised by the air.\r\n\r\nA solution of yellow prussiate is added to the iron solution in such\r\nquantity that a very small excess of iron salt is left; there results\r\na white or rather, since the ferrous sulphate always contains small\r\nquantities of ferric oxide, a pale blue precipitate. This is allowed\r\nto settle, the liquid drawn off as completely as possible from the\r\nprecipitate, and nitric acid then added, or a solution of bleaching\r\npowder, followed by the amount of sulphuric acid required to decompose\r\nit. The nitric acid or the chlorine liberated from the bleaching powder\r\nspeedily effects the oxidation, changing the pale blue colour to the\r\ndeep blue of Chinese blue. The precipitate should be left for several\r\ndays in contact with the liquid in order to complete the oxidation;\r\nit is then well washed and dried. Pieces of definite shape and size\r\nbearing the trade mark of the firm are often pressed from the blue when\r\nit has acquired a stiff consistency.\r\n\r\nThere are many formulæ for the preparation of Chinese blue, differing\r\nin regard to the quantities of green vitriol, yellow prussiate, and\r\nnitric acid or bleaching powder to be used. It is, however, clear\r\nthat only _one_ formula can be correct, that in which the quantities\r\nof materials are equivalent, since the reactions take place between\r\nequivalent quantities. In practice the equivalent quantities would not\r\nbe weighed to the tenth of a gramme—there would be no object in such a\r\nproceeding, since in works chemically pure substances are not used; but\r\nmanufacturers should work according to equivalent quantities in order\r\nto use up their materials as completely as possible. No increase in\r\nlabour is involved, the same labour weighs one or another quantity.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of materials in which the least loss is involved is here\r\ngiven. Nine kilogrammes of green vitriol are dissolved in 100 litres of\r\nwater, 15 kilogrammes of strong sulphuric acid are added, and then a\r\nsolution of 15 kilogrammes of yellow prussiate in 100 litres of water.\r\nThe solutions are kept in constant motion during the mixing. As soon\r\nas the decomposition is finished, without waiting for the precipitate\r\nto settle, steam is led in and 20 kilogrammes of nitric acid of 1·3298\r\nspecific gravity added in small portions. The heating by direct steam\r\nis continued until red vapours are no longer evolved from the liquid,\r\nwhich is a sign that the oxidation is finished.\r\n\r\nAlthough the use of direct steam is very convenient for heating, since\r\nwooden vessels can be used and the heating quickly accomplished, it\r\nmay be dispensed with, and the solutions heated in pans or even not at\r\nall. In this case the oxidation lasts considerably longer than when the\r\nliquid is heated. In the process recommended by Gentele 109 parts of\r\nyellow prussiate are used to 20 parts of green vitriol, each dissolved\r\nin much water. The precipitate is heated for a short time with 51 parts\r\nof nitric acid of 1·2285 specific gravity and 16 parts of sulphuric\r\nacid. The mixture is allowed to stand for several days to complete the\r\noxidation before the precipitate is separated from the liquid.\r\n\r\nIn Hochstätter’s method, solutions of 6 parts of yellow prussiate in\r\n15 parts of water and of 6 parts of green vitriol in 5 parts of water\r\nare mixed. To the precipitate 24 parts of strong hydrochloric acid and\r\n1 part of sulphuric acid are added, and then a solution of bleaching\r\npowder in 80 parts of water until the liquid smells distinctly of\r\nchlorine. Apart from the fact that this method does not employ\r\nequivalent quantities of iron salt and yellow prussiate, it is also\r\nto be regarded as unsuitable, since the addition of sulphuric acid\r\nproduces calcium sulphate, which, being soluble with great difficulty,\r\nwill be precipitated along with the blue, making the shade lighter. The\r\naddition of sulphuric acid should be omitted and only hydrochloric acid\r\nused, the calcium chloride formed by the decomposition of the bleaching\r\npowder being very soluble in water. Many formulæ given for the\r\nmanufacture of Chinese blue are said to produce a pigment of special\r\nbeauty. This, however, is incorrect. Chinese blue is a compound of\r\nfixed composition, which is always formed when equivalent quantities of\r\nthe salts are used and the precipitate converted into the blue compound\r\nby one of the oxidising agents given. It is most simple to use nitric\r\nacid as the oxidising agent; for this purpose the presence of chlorine\r\nin the acid is harmless. When sufficient space and time are allowed, a\r\nspecial oxidising agent may be omitted and the oxidation of the white\r\nprecipitate accomplished by atmospheric air.\r\n\r\nIn working in this manner the precipitate is washed several times\r\nwith water, and spread in a thin layer upon boards which are placed\r\nin rows one above the other. In a short time the mass turns blue on\r\nthe surface, but the pale colour remains underneath much longer, since\r\nthe access of oxygen to the interior is difficult. The boards must be\r\nleft until the mass has a uniform colour throughout. In order that the\r\npaste shall not dry too thoroughly whilst on the boards it is desirable\r\nto make it very fluid. If the precipitate has been completely washed\r\nbefore the oxidation the product is finished after drying, but if a\r\nportion when completely dried shows a crystalline incrustation, salts\r\nare still present, which must be removed by careful washing.\r\n\r\n=Prussian Blue.=—As we have already stated, Prussian blue is identical\r\nin chemical nature with Chinese blue, from which it differs only by\r\ncertain additions which are made in order to reduce the price. Prussian\r\nblue should therefore be regarded as a more or less impure Chinese\r\nblue; less pure materials are used in its preparation than for the\r\nfine Chinese blue. Instead of pure potassium ferrocyanide, the crude\r\nsalt, which is sold by the prussiate makers at a lower price, is used\r\nfor Prussian blue; in addition to the ferrocyanide this crude salt\r\ncontains a considerable proportion of other salts, including a quantity\r\nof potassium carbonate.\r\n\r\nThe ferrous sulphate used for Prussian blue is mixed with alum, which\r\nneutralises the potassium carbonate, precipitating alumina, by which\r\nthe precipitate formed from the yellow prussiate and ferric salt is\r\nmade paler. If the pale blue precipitate were treated with acids they\r\nwould first dissolve out the alumina; this should be avoided, since the\r\nalum has been added with the intention of increasing the quantity of\r\nprecipitate and making the pigment paler. The precipitate can therefore\r\nonly be changed into the blue pigment by spontaneous oxidation; this\r\nis accomplished by the oxygen of the air in the manner previously\r\ndescribed. The oxidation is more rapid according to the quantity of\r\nferric salt contained in the green vitriol at the commencement; it\r\nis convenient to prepare a large quantity of green vitriol solution\r\nand expose it in shallow vessels to the air so that the oxidation may\r\nproceed. But if the solution of green vitriol were exposed alone to\r\nthe action of the air a rust-coloured precipitate of basic salt would\r\nbe deposited at the bottom of the vessels. To prevent the formation of\r\nthis basic salt, sulphuric acid is added in small quantity, and, as the\r\noxidation proceeds, further small quantities of acid are added. In this\r\nway a solution of ferric sulphate is slowly formed, which gives with\r\nyellow prussiate a blue precipitate requiring little further oxidation.\r\n\r\n=Mineral Blue, Brunswick Blue.=—This pigment, the most reduced of the\r\ncolours of this class, is obtained by mixing white pigments, barytes,\r\npipe clay, etc., with the already impure Prussian blue.\r\n\r\n=Soluble Prussian Blue.=—The modification of ferric ferrocyanide easily\r\nsoluble in water is obtained by adding a solution of a ferric salt\r\nto a solution of yellow prussiate, the latter being in considerable\r\nexcess. Brücke gives the following method: a solution is prepared of\r\n217 grammes of yellow prussiate in 11 kilogrammes of water. Another\r\nsolution contains 100 grammes of ferric chloride in 1 litre, 1 litre\r\nof which is mixed with 2 litres of a saturated solution of Glauber’s\r\nsalt and the mixture added to the prussiate solution so long as a blue\r\nprecipitate forms. The Glauber’s salt plays no part in the formation\r\nof the colour; it is added to prevent the solution of the precipitate,\r\nwhich is insoluble in salt solutions. The precipitate is brought on to\r\na filter and washed with water until the washings begin to be blue,\r\nwhich is a sign that the salts have been almost completely removed.\r\nThe precipitate cannot be further washed without the loss of a large\r\nquantity which would be dissolved by the water; without further washing\r\nit is slowly dried in the air.\r\n\r\nSoluble Prussian blue has but a limited application; anatomists use its\r\nsolution to inject specimens, and it was formerly used for blue writing\r\ninks, for which purpose aniline dyes are now preferred. It may also be\r\nremarked that ordinary Prussian blue readily dissolves in a solution of\r\noxalic acid; the solution was also used as a writing ink, but since it\r\nattacks steel pens, it has now been replaced by solutions of dyes which\r\nhave no action on steel.\r\n\r\n=Special Processes for the Manufacture of Chinese Blue.=—In place of\r\nchlorine or nitric acid manganic chloride can be used to oxidise the\r\nwhite precipitate obtained from yellow prussiate and green vitriol.\r\nThis process is based upon the property of manganic chloride to readily\r\ngive up part of its chlorine and be changed into manganous chloride\r\n(the ordinary chloride of manganese). The conversion of the white\r\nprecipitate into the blue is thus also in this case indirectly effected\r\nby chlorine.\r\n\r\nMany varieties of pyrolusite contain considerable quantities of\r\nmanganic oxide which are of little use in the manufacture of chlorine,\r\nfor which pyrolusite is chiefly employed. If such pyrolusite be\r\ndigested with crude hydrochloric acid for several days, the manganic\r\noxide is dissolved with the production of manganic chloride.\r\n\r\nThe oxidation of the white precipitate is performed in the usual way;\r\nafter running off the liquid an excess of manganic chloride solution is\r\nadded, as soon as two tests taken at an interval of a few minutes show\r\nno further increase in the depth of the colour, the reaction is ended\r\nand the solution of manganous chloride is drawn off.\r\n\r\nAny powerful oxidising agent may be used to oxidise the white\r\nprecipitate; chromic acid has been proposed for this purpose, but up to\r\nthe present the chromates are too dear to be used in place of the cheap\r\noxidising agents previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the present endeavours to utilise by-products of the\r\nchemical industries, a method for preparing this pigment may be\r\nmentioned which would certainly be very profitable on the large scale.\r\nCoal gas before purification contains some quantity of ammonium\r\ncyanide, which is decomposed by ferric oxide with the production of\r\nPrussian blue. This pigment might be made by passing coal gas over\r\nvery finely divided ferric oxide, until it was completely converted\r\ninto Prussian blue. The process is, however, not practicable on the\r\nlarge scale: the ferric oxide would have to be exposed in an extremely\r\nthin layer to be completely converted into Prussian blue, and the\r\ntransformation would require a long time. A better process is to make\r\nyellow prussiate instead of Prussian blue. A mixture of ferric oxide\r\nwith coarse sawdust is spread out in thin layers, over which the impure\r\ncoal gas passes. When the mass has acquired a blue colour owing to the\r\nPrussian blue produced, it is treated with a mixture of quicklime and\r\npotassium sulphate. Potassium ferrocyanide is formed; it is obtained\r\nin crystals by the evaporation of the solution and can be used in the\r\npreparation of Prussian blue.\r\n\r\nThe “Laming’s mass,” now generally used in gas works, contains, after\r\nuse, a considerable quantity of cyanogen compounds, and it would only\r\nrequire a short trial to decide whether it was more advantageous\r\nto make this mixture by exposure to air again suitable for the\r\npurification of coal gas, or to use it to obtain yellow prussiate.\r\n\r\n=Turnbull’s Blue.=—When a solution of a ferrous salt is precipitated\r\nby potassium ferrocyanide, a fine blue precipitate is formed,\r\nidentical in physical properties with Chinese blue, but differing in\r\nchemical constitution. It is ferrous ferrocyanide, Fe₃[Fe(CN)₆]₂.\r\nThe manufacture of Turnbull’s blue is expensive; the pigment has no\r\nspecially advantageous properties and is therefore seldom made.\r\n\r\nIn preparing this pigment, a solution of yellow prussiate is\r\ntransformed into red prussiate by passing chlorine through it so long\r\nas it is absorbed by the liquid; the mother liquors from which red\r\nprussiate has been crystallised may be used with advantage. When to the\r\nsolution of red prussiate green vitriol solution is added so that the\r\nformer remains in excess, a soluble Turnbull’s blue is obtained, but\r\nwhen excess of green vitriol is used the insoluble form is produced.\r\n\r\nChinese blue and Turnbull’s blue are used both as oil and water\r\ncolours, and these handsome but not particularly durable pigments are\r\nalso employed in colouring wall papers.\r\n\r\n=Antwerp Blue= is a mixture of Prussian blue with zinc cyanogen\r\ncompounds. It is obtained by precipitating a solution of 2 parts of\r\nzinc sulphate and 1 to 2 parts of green vitriol (according as pale or\r\ndeep blue is required) by a dilute solution of yellow prussiate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nULTRAMARINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the present time blue, green, red and violet pigments come into the\r\nmarket under the name of ultramarine. The green and blue have been\r\ncommercial articles for about seventy years; the violet and red were\r\nintroduced about the year 1860.\r\n\r\nAt first the name ultramarine was restricted to a natural blue pigment\r\nobtained from _lapis lazuli_, which was extremely costly. Accounts\r\nof the payments of Italian artists, still extant, show the expensive\r\nnature of the ultramarine blue used in their paintings. At that time,\r\nwhen artists were compelled themselves to make the majority of their\r\npigments, ultramarine was made in a most laborious manner from _lapis\r\nlazuli_, for which incredibly high prices were paid. In order to make\r\nthe mineral easier to powder the lumps were heated, and, whilst hot,\r\nthrown into water. They were then powdered as finely as possible. The\r\npowder was mixed with melted resin, and the mixture kneaded under\r\nwater for a long time. The ultramarine suspended in the water by this\r\ncrude method of levigation was obtained by allowing the wash waters\r\nto settle. Few places are known at which _lapis lazuli_ occurs in\r\nquantity. It is chiefly obtained in China and Thibet, and, considering\r\nthe little intercourse between Europe and these distant countries at\r\nthat time, it is no wonder that the price of ultramarine was fabulously\r\nhigh. One ounce cost about £8—a price which is explained by the small\r\nyield of ultramarine from the best _lapis lazuli_. By the most careful\r\nwork not more than from 2 to 3 per cent. of the mineral was obtained,\r\nthe residue consisted of foreign minerals.\r\n\r\nThe enormously high price of this pigment was the stimulus for the\r\nendeavours to make it artificially. The attempts are to be regarded not\r\nonly as completely successful, but it must be allowed that science has\r\ngone a considerable step further than nature, since the researches have\r\nmade it known that there is not only a blue ultramarine, but also a\r\ngreen, and, according to the latest researches, there exist in addition\r\nviolet, red and white compounds, also to be described as ultramarines.\r\nWith the discovery of the methods by which ultramarine can be made\r\nartificially, the preparation of this pigment from _lapis lazuli_\r\ncame to an end, and has now but historic interest. The discovery of\r\nartificial ultramarine is due to the French chemist Guimet and to the\r\ngreat German chemist Gmelin. Ultramarine was first manufactured in\r\nGermany in the year 1828 by A. Köttig, as a branch of the porcelain\r\nworks at Meissen in Saxony, where the manufacture was continued for\r\nabout fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the aniline dyes is rightly called a triumph of human\r\nintellect. The artificial manufacture of ultramarine deserves the same\r\ndescription in no less degree, although it has not effected so great a\r\nrevolution as the former.\r\n\r\nAttempts to make ultramarine artificially would naturally be based on\r\nthe analysis of the natural product. The following comparison of the\r\ncompositions of natural and artificial ultramarines shows how nearly\r\nthe artificial product approaches the natural:—\r\n\r\n                         NATURAL ULTRAMARINE.\r\n\r\n                           Clément and Desormes.

Szilasi found three samples of green ultramarine to have the\r\nfollowing composition:—\r\n\r\n    Water                2·20    1·20    1·19\r\n    Aluminous residue    1·80    1·42    1·41\r\n    Silica              16·73   17·18   16·74\r\n    Aluminium           15·92   15·87   16·15\r\n    Sodium              18·42   18·18   18·10\r\n    Sulphur              7·19    6·97    6·85\r\n\r\nThere are many other analyses in addition to those we have given and\r\nagreeing with them, so that there is no doubt as to the composition of\r\nultramarine, but as to the manner in which the elements are grouped\r\nnothing is definitely known. Some chemists are of the opinion that\r\nthe colouring principle of ultramarine is a sulphur compound of iron,\r\nwhilst others oppose this view and consider that the colour is due\r\nto the combination of a double silicate of alumina and soda with an\r\nunknown sulphide of sodium. Although no blue or green compound is\r\nknown of corresponding composition, the majority of chemists incline\r\nto the latter view. Experience has shown that the presence of iron in\r\nany of the materials used in the manufacture of artificial ultramarine\r\nis very dangerous to the success of the operation, and at the least\r\nconsiderably injures the beauty of the product.\r\n\r\nAlthough the manufacture of ultramarine is now very well known, it\r\ncannot be denied that some works produce a pigment of a shade which\r\ncannot be obtained by others. These works keep their method very\r\nsecret, so that it is not possible to say with certainty whether they\r\nhave introduced a process varying from that commonly known, or whether,\r\nby carefully watching the process, they have achieved great technical\r\ndexterity in the manufacture of this product. The latter appears the\r\nmost probable, for in order to obtain a good result, many experiments,\r\nand an accurate knowledge of the raw materials, are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe raw materials used are as follows: pure aluminium silicate, sodium\r\nsulphate, soda, sulphur, coal. The aluminium silicate is used in the\r\nform of fine china clay or kaolin, sodium sulphate and soda must be\r\nused in the anhydrous form, the sulphur is the ordinary commercial\r\nsubstance purified by distillation. Charcoal or coal containing little\r\nash can be used.\r\n\r\nWhilst the remaining raw materials are always of similar composition,\r\nthe china clay from different localities possesses a very varying\r\ncomposition. This substance must be carefully chosen. There is hardly\r\nany kaolin which is naturally of sufficient purity to be used without\r\npurification; it is well known that the china clay used for porcelain\r\nis subjected to a thorough preparation before it is used. Kaolin, like\r\nall clays, has been produced by the decomposition of feldspar; when\r\nthe aluminium silicate so formed was able to deposit without foreign\r\nadmixtures, that mineral was formed which is the purest of all clays\r\nand is called kaolin. The more foreign substances are mixed with\r\nthe aluminium silicate the further is the clay removed from kaolin.\r\nThe impurities which generally accompany the aluminium silicate are\r\nquartz sand, chalk and ferric oxide. We distinguish accordingly\r\nbetween kaolin, white clay or pipe clay, clay, and lastly marl, a clay\r\ncontaining much chalk.\r\n\r\nEven the purest kaolin contains certain impurities, of which quartz\r\nsand is the principal and the least harmful. Before kaolin can be\r\nused in the ultramarine manufacture it must always be purified by\r\nlevigation; it is then ignited at a low temperature and powdered under\r\nstamps or in mills. The other materials required are generally produced\r\nby the chemical works in a condition of such purity that they can be at\r\nonce used.\r\n\r\nOccasionally Glauber’s salt contains iron, which would spoil the shade\r\nof the ultramarine. The iron can be easily removed by dissolving the\r\ncrystallised salt in water, adding a little milk of lime and leaving\r\nthe liquid for several days, stirring frequently. The lime neutralises\r\nevery trace of free acid, and at the same time produces an ochre-yellow\r\nprecipitate of ferric hydrate. The solution of Glauber’s salt thus\r\nfreed from iron is evaporated in reverberatory furnaces, in which\r\nthe salt is then calcined. This operation is not only simpler than\r\nevaporating the solution in iron pans to crystallisation and subjecting\r\nthe dried salt alone to calcination, but it also guards against fresh\r\ncontamination by iron, which might be caused by the use of iron\r\nevaporating pans.\r\n\r\nThe sulphur and coal are employed in a soft powder, which is most\r\nreadily obtained by placing the coarsely powdered materials in rotating\r\ndrums containing a number of iron balls. By continued rotation the\r\nmaterials are converted to any desired degree of fineness without the\r\nproduction of dust. The powder is then put through fine sieves by which\r\nthe larger particles are retained.\r\n\r\nThe proportions in which the raw materials are mixed vary within\r\ncertain limits; fixed quantities can only be given for a kaolin of\r\ndefinite composition. Definite formulæ are known by which ultramarine\r\nis made, but these can only be regarded as approximate. The proportions\r\nemployed by French manufacturers differ considerably from those usual\r\nin German works. This variation is chiefly due to the difference in\r\nthe composition of the kaolin employed in the two countries.\r\n\r\nFrom the composition of the different mixtures one conclusion may be\r\ndrawn with certainty—sufficient sodium is always used to neutralise\r\nhalf the silicic acid of the kaolin and to form some quantity of\r\nsodium sulphur compounds. In the successful process of the German\r\nmakers a portion of the soda unites with the silica during heating. By\r\nthe action of the coal on the Glauber’s salt it is reduced to sodium\r\nsulphide, which, since sulphur is present, unites with a further\r\nquantity of that element. The sodium sulphur compounds then unite with\r\nthe silicates of aluminium and sodium to form a green compound, which\r\nis converted into blue ultramarine by a further treatment with sulphur\r\nin the presence of air.\r\n\r\nInstead of using Glauber’s salt, which must always be decomposed in\r\nthe first process, the sodium sulphide may be formed by the action of\r\nsulphur on soda in the presence of coal. This procedure is adopted in\r\nthe French process. The proportions of the mixture used in different\r\nworks vary. If the kaolin employed is assumed to be bisilicate of\r\nalumina—a somewhat arbitrary assumption—the following mixture can be\r\nsuccessfully used:—\r\n\r\n    Anhydrous kaolin           100\r\n        ”     Glauber’s salt    42\r\n        ”     soda              42\r\n    Sulphur                     60\r\n    Coal                        13\r\n\r\nIn working by the French method the following formula is suitable:—\r\n\r\n    Anhydrous kaolin           100\r\n        ”     soda             100\r\n    Sulphur                     62\r\n    Coal                        14\r\n\r\nThese formulæ are not to be regarded as unalterable. In the different\r\nworks such varied mixtures are used that it may be said with truth that\r\neach works has its particular formula for the mixture, the composition\r\nof which depends on the nature of the clay used in the works. The\r\ncomposition of the mixtures used in works is kept secret as far as\r\npossible. The formulæ given above refer to a clay approximating in\r\ncomposition to the bisilicate of alumina.\r\n\r\nIt will appear from the description of the manufacture of ultramarine\r\nthat certain quantities of sodium sulphide are produced. The process\r\nis, however, conducted so that sodium sulphide shall be formed; thus\r\nthe soda and Glauber’s salt used in the mixture may be replaced by the\r\nsodium sulphide produced in previous operations. The liquors in which\r\nthe sodium sulphide is contained are evaporated to dryness, and as\r\nmuch of the residue added to the clay as corresponds to the quantity\r\nobtained from the usual amounts of soda and Glauber’s salt. Assuming\r\nthat these latter materials are pure, 80 parts of the sodium sulphide\r\nresidue correspond to 100 parts of soda, and 60 parts to 100 parts of\r\nGlauber’s salt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF ULTRAMARINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have thought it necessary to an understanding of the manufacture\r\nof ultramarine to discuss the production of this important pigment in\r\nsome detail, for it is only possible to properly conduct an operation\r\nregulated by chemical laws when the processes which take place are\r\naccurately known.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of the materials used in making ultramarine must be most\r\nintimate in order that the constituents may act chemically upon one\r\nanother. In some works the mixing is performed in a very laborious\r\nmanner—upon a heap of the dried, levigated clay the remaining materials\r\nare thrown, and the whole shovelled about till it is completely\r\nhomogeneous. Naturally, instead of this primitive and costly operation,\r\nmechanical mixers may be used, but the mixture can also be effected\r\nin a simpler manner, which almost dispenses with the necessity for\r\na mechanical process. Of the substances to be mixed only kaolin and\r\nsulphur are insoluble in water; the others and also the by-products\r\nof previous processes are easily soluble. The soluble and insoluble\r\nconstituents of the charge may be mixed in a very simple way by\r\nbringing the levigated kaolin in the form of paste, without drying,\r\ninto a pan, adding the solutions of the salts and the powdered sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe pans are most conveniently heated by the fire gases from the\r\nultramarine furnaces. After mixing the solutions with the clay to\r\na thick paste the heating is commenced, the solid substances are\r\nprevented from sinking to the bottom by continual stirring, the\r\nmixture is slowly evaporated, and an extremely intimate and complete\r\nincorporation of the constituents occurs. The heating is continued\r\nuntil a dry mass is obtained, which may be used for the second\r\noperation without powdering.\r\n\r\nThe mixture of raw materials is heated for a long time at a clear red\r\nheat, or, in some works, at a white heat. The operation demands some\r\ncare; air must be excluded and the whole mass must acquire a uniform\r\ntemperature. If both these conditions are not obtained in heating it is\r\nvery difficult to obtain a product of uniform colour.\r\n\r\nIn different works different arrangements are used for the calcining\r\nprocess. In the older methods crucibles or dishes of fire-clay were\r\nused, of such a shape that the bottom of one crucible formed the lid\r\nof the crucible beneath, just as is the case with the saggers used in\r\nporcelain kilns. The mixture is closely pressed into the crucibles, of\r\nwhich piles are built in the furnaces. These must be so arranged that\r\neach crucible is surrounded by the fire. The furnaces are very similar\r\nto porcelain kilns.\r\n\r\nThis method of calcining is obviously attended with many drawbacks; a\r\nlarge number of costly crucibles is required, a certain proportion of\r\nwhich is lost at each burning, either by breakage in the fire or in\r\nfilling. The pressing of the charge into the small crucibles requires\r\nmuch labour, as also the placing of the crucibles in the furnace and\r\ntheir removal; at the end of the nine to ten hours’ calcining, it is\r\nnecessary to wait some time to take the crucibles out of the furnace,\r\nor considerable loss will be caused by breakage of the crucibles due to\r\nrapid cooling.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons in most works crucibles have been abandoned in favour\r\nof muffles, a large number of which are built in one furnace. The\r\ncharge is placed in the muffles; after completion of the calcining it\r\nis quickly raked out, and the still hot muffle at once recharged, thus\r\nthe losses of time and heat are reduced to a minimum. The muffles are\r\ngenerally about 1 metre long, 1 metre wide and 30 to 40 centimetres\r\nhigh. They are made of fire-clay, and, when kept in uninterrupted use,\r\nlast a long time. The muffles have a small opening at the back which\r\ncommunicates with the furnace, so that the gases evolved have a free\r\noutlet without reaching the working place. The front of the muffle is\r\nclosed by an iron plate in which are small openings, through which the\r\ncontents can be examined without the entry of much air.\r\n\r\nThree muffles are generally built in a furnace, but, by suitable\r\nalterations in the construction, a considerably larger number may be\r\nheated in one furnace. Whatever the number of muffles, the furnace must\r\nbe so arranged that the fire can be controlled at will. This is best\r\ndone by a good damper; all the muffles must be uniformly heated.\r\n\r\nJ. Curtius recommends cast-iron cylinders, lined with a thin layer of\r\nfire-clay. For this purpose a covering of fire-proof cement is used to\r\nprotect the retorts. This covering, as it is gradually destroyed, may\r\nbe renewed by smearing over the damaged places with fire-proof cement,\r\nmixed with water or some binding material. Aluminium silicate, graphite\r\nand coke may also be used. The retorts, _a_ (Fig. 28), project through\r\nthe wall of the furnace at one end. They rest on fire-proof stone\r\nbridges, and can be put into communication with the air by the pipe,\r\n_m_, which can be closed air-tight. Short pipes, _k_ and _d_, which\r\ncan be closed, connect the interior of the retort with the cooling and\r\ncollecting chambers, _P_ and _g_, the latter of which is connected by\r\n_r_ with the vessel, _h_, where the gaseous products are absorbed. The\r\nporous plate, _f_, prevents the charge in the hinder part of the retort\r\nfrom becoming open and falling to pieces during stoking. In order to\r\nobtain a regular heating of the retorts the fire gases passing through\r\nthe space, _q_, are led away at two opposite places by flues into the\r\nmain flue, _F_. The intimate mixture of finely-powdered materials\r\nis introduced into the hinder part of the retort, the porous plate,\r\n_f_, placed in position, the cover, _t_, closed up air-tight, and the\r\nconnection with the chamber, _P_, closed. On heating, the volatile\r\nproducts pass through the porous plate and the pipe, _d_, into the\r\nchamber, _g_, the more volatile portions, without mixing with the\r\nfurnace gases, passing direct to the absorption vessel, _h_, or to a\r\nlead chamber, whilst the sulphur which distils over remains in _g_.\r\nWhen the reaction is finished, by opening the cover, _t_, and the tube,\r\n_m_, the crude green ultramarine in the retort can be rapidly oxidised\r\nto blue by aspirating air at _m_, or after closing the opening, _d_,\r\nand removing the plate, _f_, the green ultramarine can be raked into\r\nthe collecting chamber, _P_, and there oxidised. The retorts are then\r\nimmediately re-filled with the mixture and the temperature raised.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\nThe heating of a charge lasts nine to ten hours; the larger the\r\nquantity of sodium sulphide in the mixture the shorter is the time\r\nrequired. The mixture is spread out in the muffles in a layer 7 to\r\n9 centimetres thick, and brought to a moderate red heat. When the\r\nwhole mass is uniformly hot it is more strongly heated; the change\r\nof the constituents then becomes visible. The mixture takes at first\r\na brownish colour, and is somewhat similar in appearance to liver\r\nof sulphur. The colour soon begins to incline to green, and finally\r\nchanges to a tolerably pure green, but always has a yellow tinge. Those\r\nparts of the hot mass which come into contact with air are more blue,\r\nand occasionally change to a pure blue. When crucibles are used the\r\nupper layer of the contents is always bluer than the lower, and when\r\ncrucibles crack during the heating the portions near the cracks always\r\nshow distinctly a more or less blue colour.\r\n\r\nWhen the calcination is finished the hot mass drawn out of the muffles\r\nis at once brought into washing vessels, in which it is treated with\r\nwater so long as soluble materials are extracted. The compounds\r\ndissolved in the water are chiefly sodium sulphide and sulphate and\r\na little alumina dissolved in caustic soda. The presence of a larger\r\nquantity of caustic soda in the wash waters indicates too violent\r\nheating. In this case the mass will not mix up easily in water; it\r\ncontains sintered lumps. The washed material is strained, spread out\r\non boards or linen stretched across frames, and completely dried by\r\nartificial heat.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the product may be described as green ultramarine and\r\nsold as such, or it may be converted into blue ultramarine. For the\r\nlatter purpose it is ground to a moderately fine meal, but green\r\nultramarine must be ground to a very fine powder; the finer the powder\r\nthe brighter the shade.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain blue ultramarine from the washed and ground\r\nsubstance, it is subjected for a short time to a moderate red heat\r\nwith unrestricted access of air. The heating by which the blue colour\r\nis produced must be continued until the proper shade is obtained.\r\nThis operation is conducted in special muffles; in many works it is\r\ncustomary to sprinkle powdered sulphur upon the heated mass during the\r\nroasting. The sulphur burns, forming sulphur dioxide, which escapes\r\ninto the furnace through an opening at the back of the muffle. The\r\nobject of the addition of sulphur may be to keep the temperature from\r\nrising beyond a certain point, or to prevent a possible reduction of\r\nthe sulphur compounds in the ultramarine.\r\n\r\nThe muffles used for finishing the ultramarine are similar to those\r\nused in making green ultramarine; they are generally 50 centimetres\r\nwide and 100 to 120 centimetres long. A muffle of this size will\r\ncontain 6 to 18 kilogrammes of green ultramarine. The temperature is\r\ngradually raised to a gentle red heat, each muffle being provided in\r\nfront with an iron plate which prevents the cooling of the contents by\r\nthe external air. When the charge in the muffles is carefully observed,\r\nit is noticed that the blue colour first appears at the surface and\r\nthe edges, _i.e._, at those places where the oxygen of the air has\r\nunrestricted access. The mass is frequently turned over with an iron\r\nrake, in order to expose all parts to the action of the air; samples\r\nare frequently taken in order to observe the moment at which the\r\ncolour has reached its greatest intensity, when the heating is at once\r\nstopped. By proper treatment about half an hour is required to convert\r\nthe charge of a muffle of the above dimensions into ultramarine of the\r\ndeepest blue. The hot mass is drawn out of the muffles and spread out\r\nupon flags so that it may cool quickly. During the cooling the colour\r\nis often observed to become considerably darker, which is a sign that\r\nthe ultramarine has not been heated for a sufficient length of time.\r\n\r\nMechanical arrangements are often used to continually turn over the\r\nultramarine in the muffles, which are then made in the form of\r\ncylinders in which the ultramarine is continually turned by a stirrer\r\nprovided with wings. The whole arrangement is very similar to the\r\napparatus used for roasting coffee.\r\n\r\nThe ultramarine is then carefully ground to a very fine meal; it is\r\ntolerably hard, and granite stones should be used, ordinary stones\r\nwould be too quickly worn down. It is not possible, by the most careful\r\ngrinding, to convert ultramarine into that condition of fine division\r\nwhich is necessary if it is to be ground into paint; grinding must be\r\nfollowed by levigation. The various qualities and shades brought into\r\nthe market differ only in regard to the fineness of their particles;\r\nthey do not vary in chemical nature, for the substance has always the\r\nsame composition.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens in ultramarine works that a charge does not\r\nturn out a bright blue; the product is then sold as inferior quality\r\nat a lower price, or is mixed with a larger quantity of good material.\r\nIn working by a settled process the different shades of ultramarine\r\nvary in composition between narrow limits; the difference is caused by\r\nvariations in the raw materials.\r\n\r\nIt has been already remarked that there is no agreement as to the\r\ncomposition of the colouring principle of ultramarine; some maintain\r\nthat it is an iron compound, whilst others regard the iron found in\r\nultramarine as an accidental impurity, which has no connection with\r\nthe colour. Recently this point appears to have been decided from the\r\nresults of many most accurate analyses of ultramarine. It has been\r\nfound that its chemical composition shows the greatest similarity with\r\nthe mineral nepheline.\r\n\r\nNepheline is a double silicate, its composition is expressed by the\r\nfollowing formula: Na₂O.SiO₂ + Al₂O₃.2SiO₂. By a comparison of the\r\nanalyses of green and blue ultramarine with that of nepheline, it is\r\nseen that blue ultramarine may be regarded as nepheline combined with\r\nsodium pentasulphide, whilst green ultramarine is nepheline combined\r\nwith sodium bisulphide. If this is the correct view, the two species of\r\nultramarine have the following formulæ:—\r\n\r\n    2{Na₂O.SiO₂ + Al₂O₃.2SiO₂} + Na₂S₅.\r\n    2{Na₂O.SiO₂ + Al₂O₃.2SiO₂} + Na₂S₂.\r\n\r\nUltramarine is one of the most permanent pigments. It is not altered by\r\nthe substances with which a pigment generally comes in contact. Being\r\na sulphur compound, it retains its colour completely in air containing\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. By acids, even weak organic acids such as malic,\r\ncitric or tartaric, it is rapidly decomposed, sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nbeing evolved, and a greyish white residue left. It is sometimes found\r\nthat the sugar used in making lemonade produces a perceptible smell of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. This is due to ultramarine, which has been added\r\nto the sugar to hide its yellow colour.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding account of the manufacture of ultramarine it will be\r\nunderstood that there exist only two species of ultramarine, green and\r\nblue. In commerce a large number of different shades are found, which\r\nare not to be regarded as pure ultramarine; they owe their particular\r\nshade to additions. By mixing in a white pigment, such as barytes or\r\nstarch, the paler shades are obtained; by adding a small quantity of a\r\npure red pigment a colour with a violet tinge is produced. In a similar\r\nmanner any number of shades of ultramarine can be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe following account is taken from a new comprehensive work by J.\r\nWunder, on the different ultramarines.\r\n\r\n=Preparation of Mixtures for Ultramarine.=—The following points are\r\nto be observed: Chemically pure soda and ammonia soda react with\r\ndifficulty. The presence of caustic soda in the soda facilitates the\r\nformation of sodium sulphide, and gives a finer product. It is also\r\nof advantage to sprinkle the soda with a strong solution of sodium\r\nsulphide. The more silica the mixture contains the more difficult is\r\nthe transformation into ultramarine, but the product is deeper and\r\nbetter in shade, and has more resistance to alum and weak acids. The\r\nsodium sulphide must react with silica and alumina. When oxygen enters\r\nduring the burning, silica is re-formed, which with soda and alumina\r\nproduces slags. In order to exclude oxygen many manufacturers burn\r\nwith restricted access of air; then the carbon bisulphide and sulphur\r\ngases evolved are not burnt, but, together with tarry materials from\r\nthe coal, form an evil-smelling smoke, which renders the neighbourhood\r\nobjectionable. The coal consumption in burning is also greater. The\r\nvarieties rich in silica and stable towards alum are generally dark\r\nreddish-blue. In order to obtain pure blue shades from mixtures rich in\r\nsilica they are burnt in closed crucibles to produce the green, which\r\nis powdered and heated with restricted air supply, and the admission\r\nof a little steam, to 160° to 180° C., when pure blue or greenish-blue\r\nshades are obtained as required. In this way a mixture rich in silica\r\ncan be burnt to a good blue, containing 69·32 parts of silica to 30·67\r\nparts of alumina, or 1 equivalent of Al₂O₃ to 3·84 equivalents of SiO₂;\r\nwhilst ultramarine rich in silica, made in the ordinary way, contains\r\nat the most 66·7 parts of silica to 33·3 parts of alumina.\r\n\r\n=Ultramarine Violet= was first introduced into commerce about the\r\nyear 1859 by the Nuremberg Ultramarine Works, under the direction of\r\nLeykauf. By the reaction of moist calcium chloride on ultramarine\r\nblue in the warm chambers above the furnaces the blue was changed to\r\nviolet. By the action of air a portion of the moist calcium chloride\r\nis decomposed into lime and hydrochloric acid, the latter of which,\r\ntogether with air, reacts on the blue. In 1872 Wunder, intending to\r\napply to the estimation of sulphur in ultramarine blue a method which\r\ngives good results with metallic sulphides, passed chlorine over heated\r\nultramarine. The pigment was converted into a brownish-red substance,\r\nwhich on washing combined with water and turned violet. The red\r\nsubstance is not produced at every temperature; 300° C. is the most\r\nfavourable. On washing sodium chloride is dissolved; the washed violet\r\nis free from chlorine, but has taken up water, which is expelled on\r\nheating, when the violet turns to blue. A similar brownish-red body\r\nis formed when sulphur trioxide is led over heated ultramarine blue,\r\nand when sulphur chloride acts on warm ultramarine blue. When the\r\nbrownish-red chlorine compound is introduced into absolute alcohol, a\r\nreddish-violet compound is produced, containing organic matter. Ethyl\r\nchloride is formed at the same time. When ammonia gas is passed over\r\nthe heated chlorine compound it is absorbed; a violet ultramarine\r\nis produced, from which the ammonia is not removed by washing with\r\nwater, but only by heating nearly to redness, or, better, by fusing\r\nwith caustic alkalis. Aniline combines in a similar manner. In order\r\nto obtain a good violet the brownish-red chlorine compound must not\r\nbe formed; the violet is produced by leading chlorine and steam over\r\nultramarine blue at 160° to 200° C. Blue rich in silica is most\r\nsuitable for transformation into violet. The violet so obtained is not\r\ndecomposed by lime.\r\n\r\nC. Mahla produced the chlorine in the blue itself by the reaction:\r\nNH₄Cl + 2NH₄NO₃ = 6H₂O + 5N + Cl. By heating a mixture of ultramarine\r\nblue with ammonium chloride and nitrate in crucibles at 200° C. a fine\r\nviolet is produced. It contains ammonia, which cannot be removed by\r\nwashing, but only by strongly heating or heating with concentrated\r\nalkalis. This violet is decomposed by the prolonged action of lime,\r\nin three days it is changed to a grey green. In the course of the\r\nmanufacture it was noticed that less nitrate was required in the\r\nmixture according to the length of time it was exposed in porous\r\ncrucibles to the action of air and heat; by heating for a sufficient\r\nlength of time with access of air, a good violet is obtained with\r\nammonium chloride alone. In the manufacture of violet by means of moist\r\nchlorine hydrochloric acid is formed, which is also the active material\r\nin its formation by means of ammonium chloride. It was therefore to\r\nbe expected that chlorine gas might be replaced by hydrochloric acid,\r\nif it were accompanied by sufficient air. This has been found to be\r\nthe case. The temperature must be maintained between 180° and 230° C.\r\nBelow 150° C. the blue is decomposed by moist hydrochloric acid gas; at\r\ntemperatures above 230° C. it is unchanged. Hydrochloric acid gas and\r\nair, without steam, give with ultramarine blue on heating a brownish\r\nred substance similar to that produced by dry chlorine; it also is\r\nchanged to violet by washing with water. The violet obtained by means\r\nof moist chlorine differs from the blue from which it was formed, in\r\nthat the latter has lost one-sixth of its sodium and combined with\r\nwater and much oxygen. The following is the approximate formula for a\r\nblue:—\r\n\r\n    Na₆Al₄Si₆S₄O₂₁,\r\n\r\nand for the violet obtained from it\r\n\r\n    Na₅HAl₄Si₆S₄O₂₄ + H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe violet contains much thiosulphate. If it is decomposed by nitric\r\nacid and silver nitrate added to the filtered solution a precipitate\r\nis obtained which changes in colour from white to yellow, orange and\r\nbrown, just as the precipitate given by silver nitrate in solutions of\r\nthiosulphates containing nitric acid.\r\n\r\n=Chlorine and Steam Process.=—Chlorine does not attack iron at 150° to\r\n250° C. The reaction is carried out in heated iron boxes 1 metre wide,\r\n2 metres long and 65 centimetres high. The blue is spread out in a\r\nlayer 2 centimetres thick on earthenware plates, which stand one above\r\nanother at a distance of 5 centimetres, each supported on three feet.\r\nThe plates are introduced by means of iron tongs through large openings\r\nin the top of the box; after filling iron plates are screwed on to the\r\nopenings, through them pass sheet-iron tubes reaching to the bottom,\r\nin which thermometers can be lowered on wires. The iron boxes stand in\r\nheated chambers, which have openings corresponding with the openings\r\nin the boxes, and shut off from the interior of the furnace. Chlorine\r\nand steam are led into the iron boxes at both ends through lead tubes\r\nreaching to the bottom; the parts of these tubes in the furnace and the\r\niron boxes are protected by wide sheet-iron tubes, the space between\r\nbeing filled with clay. The gases evolved, hydrochloric acid, sulphur\r\nchloride and steam, pass from the covers through earthenware pipes into\r\nboxes filled with limestone, upon which water drops, and thence to\r\nthe chimney. After filling, the boxes are heated to 280° C. and steam\r\nintroduced to remove sulphur; they are then allowed to cool to 160° C.,\r\nwhen chlorine and steam are led in for three hours. The violet is then\r\nfinished, and the residual gases are blown out by a fan.\r\n\r\n=Hydrochloric Acid and Air Process.=—The operation is conducted in\r\nthe same iron boxes, upon the bottoms of which, beneath the openings,\r\nare earthenware dishes into which hydrochloric acid can be poured\r\nthrough earthenware pipes. The chimney draught must be strong enough\r\nto draw sufficient air through these pipes into the boxes. After the\r\ntemperature has been maintained for seven hours at 220° to 230° C.,\r\nhydrochloric acid being poured in from time to time, the blue is\r\nchanged to a dull violet, which becomes brighter when hydrochloric acid\r\nis repeatedly added at diminishing temperatures, 210°, 200°, 180° and\r\n160° C. More recently the iron boxes have been replaced by stone chests\r\nor by chambers above the ultramarine furnaces, the temperature in this\r\ncase being kept at about 200° C.\r\n\r\n=Ammonium Chloride Process.=—A mixture of ultramarine blue with 5 per\r\ncent. of ammonium chloride is heated during fourteen days in porous\r\ncrucibles placed in the upper chambers of the ultramarine furnaces,\r\nwhen the contents of the crucibles become a handsome violet throughout.\r\nIf sodium nitrate is used together with ammonium chloride, the violet\r\nis formed in a much shorter time. After washing, the violet still\r\ncontains nitrogen; on ignition or heating with strong alkalis it\r\nloses ammonia. Unfortunately, this fine violet is decomposed by the\r\ncontinued action of moist slaked lime. The violets made by the first\r\ntwo processes absorb ammonia when this gas is led over them at 180° to\r\n200° C., and it cannot be removed by washing.\r\n\r\n=Pale Blue Ultramarine.=—If the violet is heated in hydrogen at 280° to\r\n290° C., it is converted into a pure, bright, pale blue. This has an\r\nabsorption spectrum in which the red is not absorbed, but appears more\r\nbrilliant than in the spectrum of ultramarine rich in alumina. Pale\r\nblue is turned violet blue by heating at 300° C., and at a red heat a\r\ndull blue. It is not yet made on a commercial scale, but on account of\r\nits great purity of shade it appears to be valuable for many purposes;\r\nperhaps it may replace alumina cobalt blue. The composition of pale\r\nblue is:—\r\n\r\n    Calculated for                Found.\r\n        Na₅       12·4 per cent.   11·9 per cent.\r\n        H₅         0·54    ”        0·62    ”\r\n        Al₄       11·7     ”        13·1    ”\r\n        Si₆       18·2     ”        19·7    ”\r\n        S₄        13·9     ”        12·7    ”\r\n        O₂₅       43·3     ”        42·0    ”  (by difference).\r\n\r\nBy a comparison of the composition of the violet and pale blue\r\nultramarines, it is seen that the chief difference is an increase of\r\nhydrogen in the latter.\r\n\r\n=Ultramarine Red.=—Since ultramarine violet increases in brightness\r\nand redness of shade in the air, Wunder erroneously believed that\r\nthis was due to oxidation, and that, consequently, the violet could be\r\nconverted into a red by oxidising agents. Nitric acid vapours led over\r\nultramarine violet at 170° to 200° C. do not act upon it, but where\r\ndrops of nitric acid are spirted over, the violet is changed to red.\r\nWunder then reduced the temperature to 135° to 145° C. and obtained\r\nthe first ultramarine red. Iron is attacked by nitric acid at lower\r\ntemperatures, but not at 135° C.; the iron boxes previously described\r\ncould therefore be used. It was afterwards found that at a sufficiently\r\nlow temperature hydrochloric acid gas converts ultramarine violet into\r\nred. The iron boxes cannot be used for this operation, as they are\r\nattacked at the temperature; the stone chests are used instead. Other\r\nacids also act on ultramarine violet; boric acid gives a reddish-violet.\r\n\r\nThe violet is spread out on the dishes standing on three feet mentioned\r\nbefore, and heated to 128° to 132° C. At higher temperatures the violet\r\nis unaltered, whilst below 100° C. it is decomposed. The hydrochloric\r\nacid is poured in from time to time through earthenware tubes into\r\ndishes in which it evaporates.\r\n\r\nA mixture of red and blue would appear violet, but would behave\r\ntowards reagents in a different manner to real ultramarine violet.\r\nUltramarine blue is decomposed at 128° to 132° C. by hydrochloric acid\r\nto a gelatinous mass, whilst at this temperature ultramarine violet is\r\nchanged into a bright red. From the blue no violet can be obtained by\r\nnitric acid, but the violet gives a red at 135° to 145° C. Analysis\r\nwould also indicate the difference. Ultramarine red has the following\r\ncomposition:—\r\n\r\n    Calculated for            Found.\r\n    Na₃       7·9 per cent.   8·1 per cent.\r\n    H₅        0·57    ”       0·72    ”\r\n    Al₄       12·3    ”      13·3     ”\r\n    Si₁₆      19·1    ”      19·3     ”\r\n    S₄        14·6    ”      15·2     ”\r\n    O₂₅       45·6    ”      43·4     ”   (by difference).\r\n\r\nIt appears that in the red two more equivalents of sodium have been\r\nreplaced by hydrogen. The violet is apparently a sodium salt of which\r\nthe red is the acid. The violet made by means of ammonium chloride\r\nis also converted by hydrochloric acid gas at 128° to 132° C. into a\r\nhandsome red containing nitrogen, and the red is changed by hydrogen at\r\n280° to 290° C. into a lighter pale blue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nBLUE COPPER PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bremen Blue and Green.=—The pigment known as Bremen blue or Bremen\r\ngreen consists of copper hydroxide. It possesses all the disadvantages\r\nof copper compounds; it is very sensitive towards sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nand sulphur dioxide; in contact with air containing the former gas it\r\nis quickly turned black. It has also other disadvantages; it cannot\r\nbe used in oil, for when ground in oil it is quickly discoloured, on\r\naccount of the formation of copper oleate. If a wall which has not\r\ncompletely dried be covered with Bremen green, in a short time it will\r\nbe covered with spots. In spite of this small stability, Bremen green\r\nis still largely used by artists on account of its low price, although\r\nit could be replaced by other pigments almost as cheap and considerably\r\nmore durable.\r\n\r\nCopper hydroxide comes into the market under many names. The pigments\r\nknown as blue verditer, lime blue and mountain blue contain essentially\r\ncopper hydroxide. The preparation of pure copper hydroxide on the\r\nlarge scale will be first described. Copper sulphate is the usual raw\r\nmaterial. In order to obtain a colour of a pure blue shade it must be\r\nfree from iron, the presence of which would result in the production of\r\na discoloured precipitate.\r\n\r\nA fairly concentrated solution of copper sulphate is warmed in a pan to\r\nabout 30° C.; weak caustic potash solution is added until the liquid\r\nis slightly alkaline. A green precipitate separates, which consists of\r\ncopper sulphate and hydroxide. In order to remove the copper sulphate\r\nfrom the precipitate, and impart to it the correct bluish-green colour,\r\nit is left on a strainer until it has acquired a pasty consistency,\r\nwhen it is brought into a tub and mixed with weak caustic potash\r\nsolution. Care must be taken that this potash solution is not too\r\nconcentrated, or it will withdraw water from the copper hydroxide and\r\nproduce black copper oxide. In order to prevent this result, which\r\nwould render the whole mass useless, a portion of the precipitate\r\nis tested with the caustic potash solution. If it is blackened, the\r\nsolution must be diluted with the necessary quantity of water before it\r\nis used. Instead of diluting with water, potassium carbonate solution\r\nis often added. The addition of the caustic liquor is continued until\r\nthe colour of a test portion of the precipitate is not deepened by\r\nfurther additions. When this point is reached the colour must be at\r\nonce withdrawn from the action of the alkali. It is brought into a\r\nlarge tub filled with water, in which it is most carefully washed with\r\nmany waters.\r\n\r\nBasic copper chloride may also be used as the raw material for this\r\npigment. It is obtained by treating scrap copper with 60 per cent. of\r\ncommon salt and 30 per cent. of sulphuric acid. The pale green basic\r\nchloride is then treated with caustic potash solution. This method\r\nis now rarely used; copper sulphate is considerably lower in price\r\nthan formerly and copper hydroxide is prepared from it with the least\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n=Neuberg Blue= is a mixture of copper blue with Chinese blue. The\r\nlarger the quantity of the latter component the deeper the colour.\r\nNeuberg blue can be more easily ground with oil than pure copper blue.\r\nIt should not be used as a distemper colour, for the Chinese blue\r\nis decomposed by the action of lime, and the colour will quickly be\r\nspoiled by the separated ferric oxide.\r\n\r\n=Lime Blue= is ordinary copper blue, mixed with varying quantities\r\nof gypsum. It is paler than pure copper blue; different shades are\r\nobtained by increasing the quantity of gypsum.\r\n\r\nThis pigment is made by dissolving 15 parts of copper sulphate in 1,300\r\nparts of water, adding a strong solution of 121 parts of ammonium\r\nchloride, and then milk of lime prepared from 30 parts of quicklime.\r\nThe precipitate is well washed, strained, ground, and finally dried.\r\n\r\nLime blue is brought into the market in several forms; in cubes\r\nobtained by cutting up the stiff paste and then completely drying,\r\nand in irregular lumps or a coarse powder. The pigments containing\r\ncopper hydroxide as their colouring principle are used less as artists’\r\ncolours than for distempering.\r\n\r\n=Payen’s Mountain Blue= is a mixture of copper hydroxide with varying\r\nquantities of calcium carbonate. It is prepared by adding calcium\r\nchloride to a solution of copper sulphate and stirring in dilute milk\r\nof lime. A green precipitate of basic copper chloride is formed;\r\npotassium carbonate solution mixed with milk of lime is then added. The\r\nlatter mixture contains caustic potash, which decomposes the copper\r\nchloride, copper hydroxide and calcium carbonate being simultaneously\r\nprecipitated. Different shades may be obtained; by increasing the\r\nquantity of lime the product is paler. This pigment commonly comes\r\ninto the market in the paste form. When it is dried the operation must\r\nbe conducted at a low temperature; copper hydroxide is converted into\r\ncopper oxide at relatively low temperatures.\r\n\r\n=Oil Blue.=—The pigment known under this name consists of copper\r\nsulphide (CuS). It can be made in several ways. The simplest process,\r\nwhich also gives a good product, is here described.\r\n\r\nSulphur is boiled in a glass flask with a long neck. When the heavy\r\nreddish brown vapours begin to fill the neck, copper turnings or wire\r\nfree from oxide are thrown in. The copper burns in the sulphur vapour\r\nwith a red flame to cupric sulphide. When it has once commenced to\r\nburn, the flask requires little heating, so much heat is produced\r\nby the combustion of the copper that the sulphur continues to boil.\r\nThe introduction of copper is continued until only a small excess of\r\nsulphur is left, the flask is then closed and allowed to cool. When the\r\ncontents have reached the temperature of the air the flask is broken,\r\nand the mass boiled with caustic potash solution in order to remove\r\nexcess of sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe product obtained by this process has a handsome violet blue colour,\r\nwhich must be shown by the whole mass. If portions taken out of the\r\nflask are black, an excess of copper has been used. In order to improve\r\nthe colour of a faulty batch, it is mixed with sulphur and quickly\r\nheated to the boiling point of sulphur, air being excluded. The excess\r\nof sulphur is then removed by boiling with caustic potash solution.\r\n\r\nOil blue is a handsome but not very durable pigment. When used in\r\nvarnish, which protects it from the action of air, it is fairly\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\n=Copper Hydroxide.=—By precipitating carefully a solution of a copper\r\nsalt with caustic soda, a blue precipitate of copper hydroxide is\r\nobtained, which, though not distinguished by any particular beauty, is\r\nadapted for use as a distemper colour and for similar purposes. The\r\noperation is conducted at ordinary temperatures; on account of its\r\nvoluminous nature the pale blue precipitate requires a long time for\r\nwashing. Hot solutions must not be used; at a temperature near the\r\nboiling point of water copper hydroxide is completely decomposed into\r\nblack copper oxide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nBLUE COBALT PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cobalt Blue, Thénard’s Blue, Cobalt Ultramarine, King’s Blue, Leyden\r\nBlue.=—The pigment known under these names is a compound of cobalt\r\noxide with alumina, and is prepared in a similar manner to Rinmann’s\r\ngreen. Of all the blue pigments used in painting, cobalt blue is the\r\nmost handsome and most durable. It is completely unaltered by the\r\natmosphere. The most powerful chemical reagents have but a slight\r\naction upon it, and their action is less the higher the temperature\r\nused in the manufacture. Cobalt blue is made by precipitating mixed\r\nsolutions of a cobalt salt and alum, washing, drying, and igniting the\r\nprecipitate. A product of pure blue colour is only obtained when alum\r\nabsolutely free from iron is used. If but very small quantities of iron\r\nare present, the red ferric oxide has a very considerable influence on\r\nthe shade of the product.\r\n\r\nThe depth of colour varies according to the proportion of cobalt salt\r\nused. The variation is not so considerable as in the case of cobalt\r\ngreen; as a rule, 50 to 100 parts of cobalt sulphate or nitrate are\r\nused to 100 parts of alum. The temperature at which the precipitate is\r\nignited must be much higher than that used for cobalt green; it should\r\nbe raised to a white heat. The crucible should be provided with a\r\nwell-fitting lid—the fire gases damage the shade of the colour.\r\n\r\nWhen cobalt sulphate is ignited with ammonia alum, cobalt blue is\r\nobtained; but this method is not to be recommended. The ignition must\r\nbe of long duration to completely drive off the sulphuric acid. The\r\nauthor has made a cobalt blue of remarkable beauty in the following\r\nmanner: Alumina obtained by precipitating electrolytically an alum\r\nsolution (page 49) was mixed with a solution of pure cobalt chloride\r\nto a thin pulp, which was quickly dried in a shallow porcelain dish.\r\nThe mixture, whilst still hot, was pressed into a crucible placed in\r\na larger one filled with magnesia; the crucible was heated to a good\r\nwhite heat, at which it was maintained for an hour, when it was allowed\r\nto cool. The cobalt blue made by this method has the purest blue\r\ncolour, being without that admixture of red which is not rarely to be\r\nperceived in this pigment. To avoid the appearance of this red tint,\r\ncertain additions are made; a small quantity of a zinc salt is most\r\nfrequently employed, according to the quantity of which more or less\r\npale shades are produced.\r\n\r\n=Cæruleum= is a pale blue pigment consisting of a compound of the\r\noxides of cobalt and tin. It is made by converting tin by the action\r\nof nitric acid into white stannic oxide, adding a solution of cobalt\r\nnitrate and evaporating to dryness in a porcelain dish whilst stirring;\r\nwhilst still warm the powder is strongly ignited. In cæruleum the\r\nchemical combination is less firm than in the compounds of cobalt oxide\r\nwith zinc oxide or alumina, strong hydrochloric and dilute sulphuric\r\nacids decompose it, continued treatment with nitric acid extracts all\r\nthe cobalt. Cæruleum resists completely all atmospheric influences.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that all the cobalt in this compound may be removed by\r\ntreatment with nitric acid leads to the conclusion that the pigments\r\ncomposed of cobalt oxide and another oxide are not chemical compounds\r\nof the two oxides, but that the alumina, zinc oxide and tin oxide\r\nserve simply as bases for the blue modification of cobalt oxide. That\r\na chemical compound cannot be present follows from the fact that the\r\nquantities of the oxides uniting together may be very considerably\r\naltered and a coloured product still obtained. The author has shown in\r\n1868 that the blue modification of cobalt oxide is obtained by heating\r\nthe red. The change of the red colour of cobalt chloride into the blue\r\nis not caused, as was formerly thought, by loss of water, but by the\r\ntransformation of the cobalt oxide contained in the compound from the\r\nred into the blue modification. Strong bases are able to retain the\r\ncobalt oxide in the blue form, and strongly basic oxides are therefore\r\nused in the manufacture of this series of pigments.\r\n\r\n=Cobalt Zinc Phosphate.=—This pigment is made by precipitating a\r\nsolution of zinc sulphate, free from iron, by sodium phosphate, adding\r\na solution of cobalt sulphate and again sodium phosphate so long as a\r\nprecipitate is produced. Excess of sodium phosphate is to be avoided,\r\notherwise a considerable quantity of cobalt remains unprecipitated. In\r\nthe directions given by Gentele it is stated that the sodium phosphate\r\nmust be in excess, and that the liquid above the precipitate must\r\npossess a reddish colour. The author’s experiments have shown that a\r\npigment in every respect equal to that produced by Gentele’s process is\r\nobtained when all the cobalt is precipitated. The precipitate, which\r\nconsists of variable quantities of zinc and cobalt phosphates, is dried\r\nand ignited, when it acquires a very deep blue colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nSMALTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis blue pigment is a very finely powdered glass, coloured by cobalt\r\noxide, according to the quantity of which products of very different\r\nshades are obtained. If a very small amount of cobalt oxide is used\r\nthe smalts has a beautiful pale blue colour, but by the use of larger\r\nquantities an almost black mass can be obtained.\r\n\r\nAlthough the proportion of cobalt oxide contained in smalts is so\r\nvariable, yet it is probably present as a compound of constant\r\ncomposition—the cobalt potassium double silicate of the formula CoO.\r\n2SiO₂ + K₂O. 2SiO₂. The numerous published analyses of smalts lead to\r\nthis conclusion. The small quantities of other metallic oxides which\r\nare found in smalts are to be regarded as chance impurities. Being a\r\nglass free from lime smalts is easily decomposed; in this respect it\r\nshows great similarity with water-glass, which is completely soluble in\r\nboiling water.\r\n\r\nSmalts comes into commerce in the form of powder. In the ”Blue Colour\r\nWorks” in which smalts is made a number of qualities are distinguished;\r\nthese are separated according to the fineness of the powder. Smalts of\r\ngood quality is composed of particles of the same size and has a pure\r\nsky-blue colour. A shade inclining to red is generally to be ascribed\r\nto the presence of iron; material of this nature is of little value.\r\n\r\nSmalts is not easily attacked by chemical reagents. It has been above\r\nstated to belong to the easily decomposed glasses, and it is attacked\r\nby reagents which ordinary glass completely resists. Finely ground\r\nsmalts is strongly attacked by boiling sulphuric acid, and, after\r\nfusion with soda, is soluble in acids. Water has some action upon\r\nsmalts; by the long continued action of a large quantity the shade is\r\ninjured, the colour acquires a greenish tinge.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of smalts there are three principal operations:—\r\n\r\n    1. Preparation of the charge.\r\n    2. Fusion of the charge.\r\n    3. Grinding the fused mass.\r\n\r\nThese processes are principally mechanical. Only as regards the\r\ncomposition of the charge is chemical knowledge required.\r\n\r\n=1. Preparation of the Charge.=—The cobalt is supplied by substances of\r\ndifferent origin—as a rule, roasted speiss cobalt and cobalt glance are\r\nused; occasionally ores are employed without previous preparation. When\r\npure cobalt salts (sulphate and nitrate) are used, a product of very\r\nfine shade is produced, but in practice these salts are not applicable\r\non account of their cost. There remain therefore only the compounds of\r\ncobalt occurring in nature. On account of the foreign substances they\r\ncontain, these require a special treatment before they can be used in\r\nthe manufacture of smalts; the treatment varies according to the other\r\nelements present in the cobalt ores. Ores containing bismuth are first\r\ntreated in order to obtain this valuable metal; ores containing arsenic\r\nare roasted in furnaces of special construction, which are connected\r\nwith a series of stone or wooden passages in order to condense the\r\narsenic trioxide completely.\r\n\r\nIf ores are employed which contain only a small quantity of cobalt, the\r\nsame quantity of glass is melted time after time with fresh quantities\r\nof the poor ore. At each operation cobalt is taken up. In place of\r\nglass a mixture of potash and very fine quartz sand may be used with\r\nadvantage. It produces that species of glass which most easily takes\r\nup cobalt oxide. The quartz sand is generally made by igniting flint\r\nand quenching in water to facilitate the grinding; it is then powdered.\r\nRiver sand is generally so impure that it would produce a brown or\r\ngreen coloured glass, which, when fused with cobalt ores, would give\r\nsmalts of a bad shade.\r\n\r\n=2. Fusion of the Charge.=—This process is very similar to the fusion\r\nof ordinary glass. The materials, in very fine powder, are carefully\r\nmixed and then ”fritted,” that is, heated until the mass sinters\r\ntogether without melting. The real fusion is accomplished in glass\r\nfurnaces. The fritted mass is fused in small ”glass pots” made of\r\nfire-clay, in a furnace similar in principle to the ordinary glass\r\nfurnace. The glass pots are made rather small, to hold about 50\r\nkilogrammes, in order to obtain as homogeneous a product as possible.\r\nThey are placed to the number of six in a furnace heated by coal, in\r\nwhich a very high temperature can be obtained. This is essential,\r\nbecause the charge has a high melting point and must be made quite\r\nfluid in order that impurities may settle.\r\n\r\nThe furnace must be slowly heated at first to prevent the pots from\r\ncracking. When they are once heated the temperature is raised to\r\nfuse the charge, which is repeatedly stirred so that the residues\r\nmay sink to the bottom. These residues consist chiefly of metallic\r\nsulphides and arsenides. After six to seven hours’ fusion the stirring\r\nis discontinued, and the temperature raised for a short time to the\r\nhighest it is possible to attain, so that the smalts may be as fluid\r\nas possible. When this is the case it can be drawn out into long thin\r\nthreads. The melted glass is then taken out and poured into cold\r\nwater. The rapid cooling makes it extremely brittle, and considerably\r\nfacilitates the powdering.\r\n\r\nWhen new pots are used for the fusion, their walls are considerably\r\nattacked by the alkalis contained in the glass. In order to prevent\r\nthis a small quantity of common smalts is fused in them before the\r\nintroduction of the real charge; the inner surface then becomes covered\r\nwith a protective glaze.\r\n\r\n=3. Grinding the Fused Mass.=—The smalts is next powdered under stamps.\r\nThese only differ from the ordinary construction in that both stamp and\r\ntrough are made of granite. The coarse powder from the stamps then goes\r\nto mills of ordinary construction, in which it is ground as finely as\r\npossible in a current of water. A blue liquid runs from the mills into\r\ntubs. The coarser particles which settle in these vessels constitute\r\nthe article known commercially as strewing smalts, which is of small\r\nvalue. The quantity of this quality is fairly considerable; it cannot\r\nall be sold; part is fused in a later operation with a fresh quantity\r\nof the fritted mixture. The liquid remaining in the tubs then gives\r\nthe different qualities of smalts. After having deposited the coarsest\r\nparticles in the first vessel it is brought into another, in which it\r\nstays only a few minutes, when it is run off into another vessel, in\r\nwhich also it remains but a short time. The liquid goes in this manner\r\nthrough from three to five vessels, and in the process deposits all the\r\ncoarser particles. The oftener the liquid is brought into fresh vessels\r\nthe finer are the particles still suspended in it, and the longer it\r\nshould remain before being drawn off into another.\r\n\r\nWhen the liquid has run through three or four vessels, as the case\r\nmay be, it still retains the finest particles in suspension. It is\r\nnow run into a tank, in which it remains until it is perfectly clear\r\nand has deposited all the blue. The deposit in this tank has a dirty\r\nbluish-grey colour; it is utilised by being added to a later fusion.\r\nIt would be expected that this last deposit would have the best shade,\r\nsince it consists of smalts in the finest state of division, which\r\nwould no doubt be the case if the smalts remained unchanged. Smalts\r\nis, however, a glass which is rather easily decomposed. In grinding,\r\nthe smalts comes in contact with large quantities of water, and in the\r\nsucceeding levigation the water decomposes it; the final residue is\r\nthus produced. In view of the easy decomposition of smalts by water, it\r\nis necessary to carry out all processes in which it is in contact with\r\nwater as rapidly as possible, in order to obtain the largest yield of\r\nsmalts.\r\n\r\nThe smalts deposited in the successive vessels have a different\r\ndegree of fineness, and are sold under particular marks. The Saxony\r\nworks, which produce the greater part of the smalts used in Germany,\r\ndistinguish the qualities by letters. The better qualities are\r\ndistinguished by the same letter, the fineness of the quality being\r\nindicated by the repetition of this letter. Thus FFFE, FFE, and FE\r\nindicate qualities which are of lower value the less often the letter\r\nF occurs in the mark. The qualities following those marked F are\r\ndistinguished by M; the lowest quality is marked OE. F indicates fine;\r\nM, medium; and O, ordinary.\r\n\r\nThe qualities generally designated smalts are those deposited in the\r\nthird and fourth vessels; they are also known as king’s blue or azure\r\nblue.\r\n\r\nThe processes used in different works apparently vary. The essentials\r\nof the processes are, however, as they have just been described; the\r\ntime during which the liquid is left in the various depositing vessels\r\nis different.\r\n\r\nSmalts, being a glass, well resists the action of the weather, although\r\non account of the absence of lime it has not the great chemical\r\nindifference of ordinary glass. Smalts is not altered by atmospheric\r\ninfluences, but from analogy with the behaviour of water-glass, to\r\nwhich smalts is closely related in chemical composition, we should\r\nconclude that, although smalts resists the action of the air for a\r\ntolerably long time, it cannot be regarded as absolutely permanent; in\r\nthe course of time potassium carbonate and silica will be formed.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of the manufacture of ultramarine, the use of\r\nsmalts has considerably decreased. Ultramarine is incomparably the\r\nmore handsome pigment, but it cannot be exposed to high temperatures\r\nwithout undergoing change of shade. For purposes in which the pigment\r\nis subjected to a high temperature, as in porcelain painting or\r\nearthware glazing, smalts has maintained its position. Smalts is also\r\nused in fresco painting, for colouring wax and tinting writing paper.\r\nFor the latter purpose it should be rejected. It has no influence on\r\nthe durability of the paper, but it spoils steel pens. Any one who\r\nhas written for a long time on paper coloured with smalts must have\r\nobserved this; the best steel pens are soon worn out by such paper. The\r\nvery fine splinters of glass present in large number in the paper act\r\nupon the steel as a very fine but very hard file, and quickly wear it\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nWhen smalts are used for painting earthenware, the outlines of the\r\ndesign are quite obliterated, the cause of which is that smalts, being\r\nitself a glass, fuses with the glaze (also a glass) of the vessel.\r\nWhen clean outlines are required smalts should not be used; some other\r\ncobalt pigment resisting heat should be substituted.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above blue pigments which are in common use, there\r\nare two others to be mentioned, rarely used and very costly—tungsten\r\nblue and molybdenum blue.\r\n\r\n=Tungsten Blue= is made by adding excess of ammonium chloride solution\r\nto a hot solution of potassium tungstate, collecting the precipitate\r\nresulting when the liquid has completely cooled, drying and heating\r\nto redness in a crucible, through the cover of which a porcelain tube\r\nreaches to the bottom. When the crucible begins to glow, hydrogen is\r\npassed through the tube; the crucible is then heated to a full red\r\nheat for fifteen minutes, the current of hydrogen being continued.\r\nThe pigment obtained in this way is a deep blue powder of velvety\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n=Tessié du Motay’s Blue.=—The following is the method of preparation:\r\n10 parts of sodium tungstate, 8 parts of tin crystals, 5 parts\r\nof yellow prussiate, and 1 part of ferric chloride are dissolved\r\nseparately and the solutions mixed. The precipitate is washed and\r\nexposed to light in thin layers. The blue colour develops in the course\r\nof several days. According to the discoverer, this pigment consists of\r\na compound of tungsten oxide with a double cyanide of iron and tin;\r\nin physical properties it is similar to good Prussian blue, but is\r\ndistinguished by greater durability on exposure to light and also by\r\na much higher cost. Up to the present this pigment has not been made\r\ncommercially.\r\n\r\n=Molybdenum Blue.=—This fine but costly pigment is obtained by mixing\r\na solution of sodium molybdate with a solution of stannous chloride.\r\nA blue precipitate is formed, which, after washing and drying, may be\r\nused as an artists’ colour. It is distinguished by great durability. A\r\ngood shade of molybdenum blue can be obtained with greater certainty\r\nby adding finely-powdered tin and a few drops of hydrochloric acid to\r\na solution of pure molybdic acid. In composition it is a mixture of\r\nstannic molybdate and the blue modification of molybdenum oxide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nGREEN MINERAL PIGMENTS—GREEN COPPER PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Copper Carbonate.=—In nature two salts occur containing copper,\r\ncarbonic acid, and water in different proportions—one, the mineral\r\nmalachite, has a fine emerald green colour; the other, azurite, is sky\r\nblue. Both minerals are ground and levigated, and brought into commerce\r\nas mountain green and mountain blue.\r\n\r\nCompounds of copper with carbonic acid, made artificially, are\r\nused under different names as pigments. The terms mountain blue\r\nand mineral blue are applied indiscriminately to various copper\r\ncompounds; as mountain blue, or Brunswick green, pigments come into\r\ncommerce containing varying quantities of copper carbonate (made by\r\nprecipitating a copper salt with soda) mixed with barytes, zinc white,\r\nor another white pigment, in order to obtain paler and deeper shades.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous Scheele’s green is also given the same name as that under\r\nwhich copper carbonate is sold, _viz._, mineral green, so that the\r\ncomposition of this colour can only be decided by analysis.\r\n\r\nA green pigment, similar in composition to malachite, is obtained\r\nby precipitating copper sulphate with soda in the cold and washing\r\nquickly. If the precipitate is left in contact with the liquid,\r\nits colour changes and it is converted into a blue mass similar in\r\nproperties to ground malachite. A green precipitate is obtained with\r\nmore certainty by precipitating a boiling solution of copper sulphate\r\nwith soda solution.\r\n\r\nBoth green and blue copper carbonate are pigments of little depth;\r\nas a rule ground and levigated malachite and azurite have a greater\r\nintensity of colour than the artificial pigments.\r\n\r\n=Copper Arsenite.=—The compounds of arsenious acid with copper are\r\namong the most handsome and bright colours which exist. It is thus\r\nto be regretted that these pigments are disappearing more and more,\r\nand indeed with every reason, from the pigments permitted by law.\r\nIn the end they must fall into complete disuse. It is a matter of\r\ncommon report that these pigments, and particularly emerald green,\r\nhave frequently caused arsenical poisoning. Numbers of people have\r\nbeen repeatedly made ill by the dust of emerald green fixed on light\r\nfabrics, such as are used for ball dresses, simply by albumin or\r\ndextrine, and brought into the air by the movements of the dancers.\r\nIt has been further shown that the air of rooms papered with hangings\r\ncoloured by emerald green contains small quantities of the most\r\npoisonous of all arsenic compounds, arseniuretted hydrogen.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is in the interest of colour makers to produce the\r\nbrightest possible colours, yet, on account of their dangerous\r\nproperties, pigments containing arsenic should be quite excluded.\r\nIn several countries their use is forbidden by law. Since there are\r\nseveral pigments which can compete in brightness with the arsenic\r\ncolours, it is to be hoped that the latter will shortly disappear from\r\ncommerce.\r\n\r\n=Scheele’s Green, Swedish Green.=—A solution of 32 parts of potash is\r\nboiled with 11 parts of white arsenic (arsenious acid) until the latter\r\nis completely dissolved. This solution of potassium arsenite is mixed\r\nwith a hot solution of 32 parts of copper sulphate free from iron. The\r\nbeautiful green precipitate is washed with hot water and dried. These\r\ndirections for the preparation of copper arsenite are due to Scheele,\r\nthe discoverer of the pigment. It can be prepared by several other\r\nmethods.\r\n\r\nWhen white arsenic and copper sulphate are dissolved together, and\r\ncaustic soda added to the boiling solution, Scheele’s green is\r\nprecipitated. When made by this method the pigment must be very\r\ncarefully washed; if the excess of caustic soda is not completely\r\nremoved it is very hard when dry, and is difficult to powder. In order\r\nto obtain darker greens the quantity of copper sulphate is increased.\r\n\r\nA particularly bright green is obtained by dissolving copper sulphate\r\nin water, with the addition of 12 to 15 per cent. of white arsenic, and\r\nprecipitating by a solution of potassium zincate, which is obtained\r\nby boiling caustic potash solution with zinc filings, hydrogen being\r\nevolved.\r\n\r\nThe shade of Scheele’s green depends on the relative quantities of\r\narsenious acid and copper sulphate employed. If the arsenious acid\r\npredominates, a pale product is obtained; when excess of copper\r\nsulphate is used, the colour is pure green. The pigment made according\r\nto the foregoing directions possesses only small covering power. A\r\nproduct better in this respect is obtained by precipitating a solution\r\nof 100 parts of copper sulphate by a solution of 90 parts of potassium\r\ncarbonate, in which 66 parts of arsenious acid have been dissolved.\r\n\r\nScheele’s green is a bright green pigment, which resists the action\r\nof the atmosphere tolerably well. It is easily decomposed by dilute\r\nacids; when strongly heated arsenious acid is set free, and copper\r\narsenate and arsenide are produced. Copper arsenite is the essential\r\nconstituent of the pigments sold under the name of mineral green, which\r\nis generally a mixture of copper arsenite with varying quantities of\r\nmountain green.\r\n\r\n=Brunswick Green, Green Verditer=, is a mixture of copper arsenite,\r\ncopper hydroxide and gypsum. It is prepared by dissolving 100 parts\r\nof copper sulphate in water, adding a solution of ¼ part of arsenious\r\nacid and 10 parts of anhydrous potassium carbonate, and finally\r\nprecipitating with milk of lime made from 20 parts of quicklime. The\r\npale to bluish-green precipitate is washed and pressed into flat cakes,\r\nwhich are brought into the market and used as lime colours. This\r\npigment is not adapted for use in oil; when applied in that medium it\r\ndarkens considerably.\r\n\r\n=Neuwied Green= is made in almost exactly the same manner as Brunswick\r\ngreen, the chief difference being that a larger quantity of arsenic\r\nis used, and thus a product obtained inclining more to green than to\r\nblue. As a rule 2 to 2½ parts of arsenious acid are used to 100 parts\r\nof copper sulphate. The colours found in commerce under this name very\r\noften consist of mixtures of emerald green and finely ground barytes.\r\n\r\n=Copper Oxychloride= was at one time largely used. At present it is\r\nscarcely employed; it has been replaced by handsomer and cheaper\r\npigments. Copper oxychloride is made by exposing a wet mixture of\r\ncopper, copper sulphate and common salt to the action of the air.\r\nTo 111 parts of copper sulphate 112·5 parts of copper and the same\r\nquantity of common salt are employed. The mixture is made into heaps,\r\nwhich are wetted and from time to time shovelled about, so that the\r\nair may come in contact with all portions of the mass, and the copper\r\nchloride be converted into basic chloride. It is advisable to allow the\r\nheaps to dry frequently after they have been turned over, so that the\r\nair may more readily penetrate into the interior. Copper oxychloride\r\nhas a pale green colour of little brilliance. On this account it is\r\nhardly ever used now; it forms the raw material for the preparation of\r\nBremen green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nEMERALD GREEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are many versions as to the discovery of this pigment. According\r\nto one it was first made in Schweinfurt by Russ and Sattler; another\r\nversion gives it that Mitis of Vienna first made it on the large scale.\r\nIt is possible, as has been the case with many chemical products, that\r\nthis pigment was simultaneously discovered by both. The method of\r\nmaking the pigment was at first a secret possessed by few. Not until\r\nthe publication of a method by Liebig in 1822 was the preparation\r\nof emerald green generally known. In recent times the industry has\r\nsupplied other colours which are less poisonous. The time should not be\r\nfar distant in which this handsome but highly poisonous pigment shall\r\nno longer be found in commerce.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance that the poisonous nature of the pigment and cautions\r\nas to its use were given great publicity, brought about the discovery\r\nof the countless names under which it has been sold. It was endeavoured\r\nby re-naming the pigment to pass it off as a different substance. All\r\nthe pigments which have been sold under the names of Mitis, moss,\r\npatent, new, king’s green, etc., are either pure emerald green or\r\nmixtures of it with barytes or gypsum, which additions were intended to\r\nalter the shade of the green and make it appear to the buyer as a new\r\npigment.\r\n\r\nIn chemical composition emerald green is a compound of copper arsenite\r\nand copper acetate. It has the following formula:—\r\n\r\n    3(CuO.As₂O₃) + Cu(C₂H₃O₂)₂.\r\n\r\nThis compound rarely comes into commerce in the pure state; it is\r\ngenerally mixed with chrome yellow or lead sulphate, which are added\r\nwith the object of producing shades between yellowish-green and dark\r\ngreen. Emerald green is a compound of constant composition. When made\r\nby different processes it has the same properties. Under the microscope\r\nit is seen to consist of crystals; when the pure substance is ground\r\nit becomes paler, the intensity of the colour being diminished by the\r\nbreakage of the crystals. The colour of emerald green is not altered\r\nby artificial light. This is a most valuable property; the majority of\r\ngreen pigments appear yellowish-green in artificial light.\r\n\r\nEmerald green can be made on the large scale by two processes; these\r\ndiffer according to the copper salt used, which is either the acetate\r\n(verdigris) or the sulphate. The latter is by far cheaper than\r\nverdigris, which is now seldom used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of Emerald Green from Verdigris.=—By boiling for several\r\nhours, 70 parts of ordinary verdigris are dissolved in water; in a\r\nsecond vessel 100 parts of arsenious acid are dissolved in 1,500 parts\r\nof hot water; the verdigris solution is filtered through a cloth into a\r\nlarger wooden vessel and mixed with two-thirds of the arsenic solution.\r\nThe mixture is well stirred and allowed to stand for some hours. A\r\nprecipitate of dull green colour is formed. This consists of copper\r\narsenite. After three to four hours the remaining one-third of the\r\narsenic solution is added; the precipitate then changes into the double\r\nsalt of which emerald green consists.\r\n\r\nThe use of such dilute solutions as are given in these directions is\r\nessential when a product of particularly good colour is required.\r\nEmerald green is a crystalline substance which is deeper in colour in\r\nproportion to the size of its crystals. Large crystals can only be\r\nformed from very dilute solutions; when strong solutions are used,\r\nthe emerald green has never the deep colour possessed by the product\r\nof dilute solutions. In the place of ordinary (basic verdigris) the\r\nso-called distilled verdigris (neutral copper acetate) can be used,\r\nof which seventy-six parts are required for the quantity of arsenious\r\nacid given. The emerald green made from ”distilled” verdigris is of\r\na yet deeper colour than that made from ordinary verdigris, but is\r\nconsiderably dearer. Such emerald green is commercially described, very\r\nincorrectly, as distilled emerald green.\r\n\r\nThe method given by Liebig is as follows: 4 parts of basic verdigris\r\nand 3 parts of arsenious acid are separately dissolved in boiling\r\nvinegar; the liquids are mixed and evaporated until a precipitate of\r\nemerald green separates.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ehrmann and Kastner, 70 parts of verdigris and 56 to 63\r\nparts of arsenious acid are separately dissolved, the boiling solutions\r\nmixed and boiled until the dirty green precipitate changes into a\r\nbright green. In consequence of the rapid formation of the precipitate\r\ndue to the boiling, the colour is pale green; if a dark-coloured\r\nproduct is required, the solutions are allowed to cool before mixing.\r\nAfter several days a very dark-coloured precipitate separates from the\r\nliquid; it consists of comparatively very large crystals of emerald\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of Emerald Green from Copper Sulphate.=—There are two\r\nprocesses. Either the solution of copper sulphate is mixed with an\r\nacetate, by which it is converted into copper acetate, and then with\r\narsenious acid, or copper arsenite is precipitated from the solution\r\nof copper sulphate and then converted into emerald green by treatment\r\nwith acetic acid. If acetic acid can be cheaply obtained, the latter\r\nprocess is to be recommended.\r\n\r\nBraconnet gives the following directions: 3 parts of copper sulphate\r\nare dissolved in a little boiling water, the hot solution is mixed with\r\na hot solution of 4 parts of arsenious acid and four parts of potassium\r\ncarbonate; the precipitate is then treated with 3 parts of pyroligneous\r\nacid. The dull-coloured precipitate at first formed is changed by the\r\nacetic acid to a bright green. The colour is more quickly produced\r\nwhen the liquid is heated nearly to boiling for several hours. When\r\nthe desired shade appears the boiling is stopped and the precipitate\r\nat once separated from the liquid, by long contact with which it would\r\ngive up arsenious acid and thus lose in shade.\r\n\r\nAccording to Fuchs, 5 kilogrammes of lime and 25 kilogrammes of copper\r\nsulphate are dissolved in acetic acid, then a boiling solution of 25\r\nkilogrammes of arsenious acid is added. The precipitate is at once\r\nformed; it is immediately separated from the liquid, washed, and dried;\r\nthe top liquor, with the addition of arsenious acid, can be again used\r\nto precipitate the copper lime solution.\r\n\r\nEmerald green has an extremely bright colour which surpasses other\r\ngreen mineral pigments in beauty. The larger are the microscopic\r\ncrystals of which it consists the deeper is the colour. In order to\r\nobtain the desired deep shade of emerald green it is necessary to\r\nuse very dilute solutions; from strong solutions the precipitate is\r\ninstantaneously produced, in which case it is impossible to obtain\r\nlarge crystals. The covering power of emerald green, in consequence\r\nof its crystalline nature, is less the deeper the shade. It cannot be\r\nregarded as a permanent colour: very dilute alkalis and acids attack\r\nit. By the action of sulphuretted hydrogen it is discoloured, owing to\r\nthe formation of black copper sulphide. It ought not to be used upon\r\nlime, which withdraws acetic acid and produces yellowish-green copper\r\narsenite.\r\n\r\nThis pigment should not be used for distempering or for colouring wall\r\npapers. By the action of the atmosphere on the arsenic it contains,\r\narseniuretted hydrogen is formed—an extremely poisonous gas, very small\r\nquantities of which are sufficient to cause serious illness in the case\r\nof susceptible people. In spite of its poisonous nature, emerald green\r\nis still largely used. All possible shades of green can be produced\r\nfrom it, yellowish-green or pale green, by admixtures of yellow\r\npigments, such as chrome yellow, or white pigments, such as barytes\r\nor white lead. Many qualities of green known as palette green, Basle\r\ngreen, etc., are generally composed of such mixtures.\r\n\r\n=Mitis Green or Vienna Green= is obtained by dissolving verdigris in\r\nacetic acid and adding a boiling solution of white arsenic in water;\r\nacetic acid is then added until the precipitate dissolves. On boiling\r\nthe clear solution a green precipitate forms, which, when dry, is\r\na deep bluish-green of characteristic shade. This pigment is now\r\npractically disused because of its poisonous nature, which is equal to\r\nthat of emerald green.\r\n\r\n=Copper Stannate.=—This green pigment, also known as Gentele’s green,\r\ncan be made by two methods. Gentele gave the following process: 59\r\nparts of tin are converted into stannic chloride by solution in _aqua\r\nregia_; a solution of 125 parts of copper sulphate is added and copper\r\nstannate is precipitated from the mixture by caustic soda, on washing\r\nand igniting it acquires a pretty green colour. It may also be made by\r\nfusing 59 parts of tin with saltpetre; the potassium stannate is then\r\ndissolved in dilute caustic soda and copper sulphate solution added;\r\nthe precipitate is washed and ignited.\r\n\r\nCopper stannate is tolerably durable, in this respect it considerably\r\nsurpasses emerald green. Only sulphuretted hydrogen has any\r\nconsiderable action upon it, turning it to a dirty brownish-green hue.\r\n\r\n=Kuhlmann’s Green= is a basic chloride of copper, obtained by heating\r\n2 equivalents of lime with a solution of 3 equivalents of copper\r\nchloride. It is important that the copper salt should be present in\r\nexcess. In shade Kuhlmann’s green is very similar to emerald green,\r\nwith which it agrees in retaining its colour by artificial light. It is\r\na somewhat less pure green than emerald green; the difference is only\r\nperceived when the two pigments are directly compared. When, however,\r\nit is considered that it is far more permanent than emerald green and\r\ncheaper, a more extended use is indicated than is yet the case.\r\n\r\n=Elsner’s Green= is a species of lake, made by mixing a solution of\r\ncopper sulphate with a decoction of fustic, adding a small quantity of\r\nstannous chloride and precipitating with caustic soda. To 100 parts of\r\ncopper sulphate 10 to 14 parts of stannous chloride are used. According\r\nas the copper salt or fustic extract predominates, the colour of the\r\nprecipitate inclines to blue or yellow.\r\n\r\nElsner’s green is also sold under the name of ”non-poisonous green”.\r\nThis description is incorrect; the pigment is indeed free from arsenic,\r\nbut is poisonous on account of the copper it contains.\r\n\r\n=Casselmann’s Green= approaches emerald green in brightness. It\r\nconsists of a compound of copper sulphate with copper hydroxide\r\nand water, CuSO₄.3Cu(OH)₂.½H₂O. This pigment is obtained by mixing\r\nsolutions of 4 equivalents of copper sulphate and 3 equivalents of\r\nsodium acetate at a certain temperature. The author’s experiments\r\nhave shown that the best results are obtained when the solutions are\r\nmixed at a temperature of about 100° C. With this object the solutions\r\nare placed in vessels standing in a pan of boiling water; when their\r\ntemperatures have risen to about 100° C. they are quickly mixed, the\r\nmixture stirred, and the precipitate allowed to settle. When the\r\nprecipitate is cautiously treated with very weak caustic soda solution\r\na rather deeper colour is obtained. This treatment should not be\r\ncontinued too long, or the precipitate may acquire an ugly bluish shade.\r\n\r\n=Lime Green= is a mixture of copper arsenite and calcium sulphate.\r\nIt is thus a pigment which ought no longer to be used, on account of\r\nits poisonous properties. It is made by boiling milk of lime with\r\nexcess of arsenious acid so long as the latter is dissolved. To this\r\nsolution of calcium arsenite, copper sulphate solution is added so long\r\nas a precipitate is formed. A mixture of copper arsenite and calcium\r\nsulphate is precipitated.\r\n\r\n=Patent Green= is similar in composition to lime green. A solution of\r\ncalcium acetate is made by adding quicklime or pure powdered limestone\r\nto acetic acid; copper sulphate solution is then added, when gypsum is\r\nprecipitated and copper acetate remains in solution. A hot solution of\r\narsenious acid is next added, and the precipitated copper salt mixed\r\nwith the gypsum at the bottom of the vessel.\r\n\r\n=Copper Borate.=—A pale green precipitate of copper borate is obtained\r\nby adding a solution of 3 parts of borax to a solution of 2 parts of\r\ncopper sulphate. It must be dried at a very moderate temperature, or it\r\nwill decompose. When perfectly dry the precipitate can be heated to a\r\nred heat without decomposition; according to the temperature employed\r\ndifferent shades are obtained. It is most convenient to take tests out\r\nof the crucible from time to time during the ignition, and to quickly\r\ncool the crucible when the desired shade is obtained. When levigated\r\nthis pigment may be used in oil, or as a porcelain colour.\r\n\r\n=Copper Silicate (Egyptian Blue).=—When a solution of water-glass is\r\nadded to a solution of copper sulphate a pale green precipitate of\r\ncopper silicate is obtained, which can be heated to redness without\r\nalteration. When 70 parts of white quartz sand, 15 parts of copper\r\noxide, 25 parts of chalk and 6 parts of soda are fused together a glass\r\nis produced which, after pouring into water, grinding and levigating,\r\nexhibits a pretty blue and very permanent colour. It appears from the\r\nexamination of the colours of the Egyptian mural paintings that this\r\npigment was already known to the ancient Egyptians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nVERDIGRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerdigris is little used as a pigment, but is important to the colour\r\nmaker, because copper colours are made from it. In wine-growing\r\ncountries it is made from the marc at small expense and without much\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nIn commerce several kinds of verdigris are distinguished; they differ\r\nin physical and chemical properties. All verdigris consists of copper\r\nacetate, either alone or combined with varying quantities of copper\r\nhydroxide.\r\n\r\n=Blue Verdigris= is made in large quantities in France and is commonly\r\nknown as French verdigris (_vert de gris naturel_). It has the\r\nfollowing formula:—\r\n\r\n    Cu(OH)(C₂H₃O₂).2½H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe process adopted in southern France, especially in the neighbourhood\r\nof Montpellier, is as follows: copper plates are placed in layers in\r\nheaps of the freshly pressed grape residues, which always contain\r\na certain quantity of must even when the most powerful presses are\r\nused. The process is conducted either in large heaps or in pots; in\r\nthe first case care must be taken that the heaps are in a room whose\r\ntemperature does not lie below 15° C. It is important to maintain\r\nthis temperature, because the formation of acetic acid takes place\r\nwith sufficient rapidity only at temperatures not below 12° to 15° C.\r\nToo high a rise of temperature in the heaps must also be avoided or a\r\nconsiderable quantity of acetic acid will be volatilised. The heaps\r\nshould therefore not be made too large, otherwise the temperature\r\ncannot be kept within the proper limits.\r\n\r\nThe residues contain a considerable quantity of sugar, which can be\r\ntransformed by fermentation into alcohol. If air has free access, the\r\nalcohol is at once oxidised to acetic acid, which is recognised by\r\nthe acid smell given off. In order to make possible the entry of air\r\ninto the interior of the heaps, rectangular wooden bars are introduced\r\nin piling up the heaps. These are carefully withdrawn when the heap\r\nis finished, so that it is traversed by passages through which air\r\ncan enter. By the simultaneous action of air and acetic acid copper\r\nacetate is formed, and since copper is always in excess, the acetate\r\nproduced is a basic salt. In consequence of the chemical processes, the\r\ntemperature of the heap rises to 35° to 40° C.; it is endeavoured to\r\nattain this temperature by artificial heat. It has already been stated\r\nthat too great a rise of temperature is accompanied by a considerable\r\nevaporation of acetic acid. The process is then finished in a short\r\ntime, but the loss of acetic acid is remarkable. When the temperature\r\nis so regulated that it varies between 25° and 30° C. the process takes\r\na normal course—four to five days may be regarded as its duration.\r\n\r\nThe grape residues are effective on account of the sugar, which is\r\ntransformed into alcohol and then into acetic acid. Residues which\r\nhave been extracted with water after pressing should not be used in\r\nthe manufacture of verdigris; they contain but little sugar and hence\r\nundergo a very feeble acetic fermentation. When such residues are used\r\nthe verdigris is often accompanied by black spots of copper sulphide\r\nupon the plates; this is due to incipient decomposition of the residues.\r\n\r\nAs a practical test for the termination of the process a strip of\r\ncopper is plunged into the heap and left for some hours. It should\r\nbe covered by a uniform coating of verdigris; if it is covered with\r\nsmall drops that is a sign that the process is not completed and the\r\nheaps must be left some time longer. The course of the process can be\r\nsimply and safely followed by means of a thermometer. This is placed in\r\na perforated copper tube and plunged into the interior of the heap. A\r\ncontinuous rise of temperature indicates a steady increase of chemical\r\naction; the temperature of the room is regulated in accordance. When\r\nthe temperature in the interior of the mass begins to fall the process\r\nis nearing the end. More heat is now supplied to assist the chemical\r\naction. The process is at an end when, in spite of external heat, the\r\ntemperature of the heap decreases and approaches the temperature of the\r\nair of the room.\r\n\r\nVerdigris can also be made by placing sheet copper and grape residues\r\nin layers in pots, which are deposited in a room of fairly uniform\r\ntemperature, such as a cellar. This method has the advantage that the\r\nformation of the verdigris is finished in a shorter time, which is more\r\nthan counterbalanced by the labour and expense of filling the pots.\r\n\r\nThe copper plates, when removed from the heaps or pots, are covered by\r\na crust of thin needle-shaped crystals of a bright green colour. They\r\nare shaken to free them from the adhering grape skins and seeds, and\r\nthen treated with weak vinegar, in which they are dipped; they are then\r\nleft standing on edge for several days. This treatment with vinegar has\r\nthe object of converting the neutral salt formed on the plates into\r\nbasic salt. The dipping into vinegar and exposure to air are repeated\r\nsix to eight times, when the originally pure green crust on the plates\r\nis gradually changed into bluish-green verdigris. These processes\r\nare continued until the plates are covered uniformly by a layer of\r\nverdigris about 5 centimetres thick. The crust is then scraped off by\r\ncopper knives and stirred with water to a paste, which is pressed in\r\nleather bags in rectangular moulds. The lumps are then slowly dried in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nPlates which have been once used give a larger quantity of verdigris\r\nin a second operation, which is to be ascribed to the fact that they\r\npossess a larger surface than unused plates. New plates are made more\r\nsusceptible to the further action of the acid by dipping in strong\r\nvinegar, by which they become covered with a layer of copper acetate.\r\n\r\nThe verdigris obtained by this method consists of crystalline scales of\r\na pale bluish-green colour, which produce a pale blue powder. In crude\r\nverdigris grape seeds are often found, and occasionally stalks and\r\npieces of metallic copper. These admixtures are a consequence of the\r\nmethod of manufacture and cannot be regarded as adulterants. Gypsum is\r\nto be regarded as an adulterant. Verdigris often contains basic copper\r\ncarbonate.\r\n\r\nVerdigris behaves in a peculiar manner with water. In contact\r\nwith a small quantity it swells to a bluish-green mass, which\r\nbecomes quite warm. Neutral copper acetate and the basic salts\r\n2Cu(C₂H₃O₂)₂.Cu(OH)₂.5H₂O and Cu(C₂H₃O₂)₂.2CuO.1½H₂O are formed, the\r\nlatter of which is insoluble.\r\n\r\nBy the addition of a larger quantity of water the basic compounds are\r\ndecomposed, neutral copper acetate dissolves, and a mixture remains\r\nof the compound Cu(C₂H₃O₂)₂.2CuO.1½H₂O and a brown basic acetate\r\ncontaining still less acetic acid. On account of this peculiar\r\nbehaviour of verdigris towards water some care is required when it is\r\nused as a water colour. A very dilute solution is not green, but has an\r\nindefinite shade.\r\n\r\n=Distilled or Crystallised Verdigris= consists of neutral copper\r\nacetate, Cu(C₂H₃O₂)₂.H₂O. It can be made from blue verdigris by\r\ntreating with the amount of acetic acid required to completely\r\nneutralise the copper oxide, or by decomposing copper sulphate with\r\nthe acetate of a metal which forms an insoluble or difficultly soluble\r\nsulphate.\r\n\r\nCrystallised verdigris is very simply made from ordinary verdigris;\r\nthe latter, whilst still moist, but containing only a small quantity\r\nof water, or the acetic acid would be too largely diluted, is brought\r\ninto a pan and strong acetic acid poured over. Strong pyroligneous acid\r\nmay be used, its empyreumatic odour is without influence on the quality\r\nof the product. The pan is heated until the contents almost, but not\r\nquite, boil. They are frequently stirred so that the particles at the\r\nbottom are brought in contact with the acid. A dark green solution is\r\nformed; when its colour no longer increases in depth it is allowed to\r\nstand until suspended solids sink to the bottom. The clear solution is\r\nthen drawn off and rapidly evaporated in shallow copper pans. It is\r\nimportant that the liquid should not contain an appreciable quantity\r\nof free acid. When a crystalline skin begins to form on the surface of\r\nthe solution it is drawn off into the crystallising vessels. These are\r\nmade of glazed earthenware; wooden rods are placed in them, on which\r\nthe crystallisation takes place. In order that large crystals shall\r\nbe obtained, it is necessary to maintain a regular temperature in the\r\nroom in which the crystallising vessels are placed. It is heated at the\r\ncommencement, and the temperature is allowed to sink a little towards\r\nthe end of the operation. From twelve to fourteen days are required to\r\nobtain large crystals. The mass of verdigris crystals adhering to each\r\nrod weighs 2·5 to 3 kilogrammes. The residual liquid is a saturated\r\nsolution of verdigris, and is used in the next operation. It is only\r\nnecessary to heat it with the residue from the first operation and some\r\nacetic acid in order to obtain a crystallisable solution of verdigris.\r\n\r\nThe residue in the pan contains metallic copper, grape stems and\r\nseeds, and basic copper acetate. The copper is extracted by moistening\r\nwith acetic acid and exposing to the air, when verdigris is formed,\r\nwhich is added to a later batch.\r\n\r\nIt is often advisable to make verdigris from a soluble copper salt; the\r\nprocess varies somewhat according to the salt employed. From copper\r\nsulphate verdigris is obtained by the action of calcium acetate. When\r\nsolutions of these compounds are mixed, calcium sulphate separates\r\nas a white precipitate, whilst a solution of the easily soluble\r\ncopper acetate is left. It is only necessary to mix the solutions in\r\nequivalent proportions, separate the liquid from the precipitated\r\ngypsum and evaporate. Gypsum is somewhat soluble in water, so that when\r\nthe solution is evaporated a double salt separates out first. This\r\nconsists of copper calcium acetate; it may be used as a pigment, but is\r\nof less value than verdigris. It is advisable to prevent the formation\r\nof this double salt, which is accomplished by adding copper sulphate\r\nto a slightly acid solution of calcium acetate until a precipitate\r\nis no longer produced. The solution of copper acetate is boiled for\r\nseveral hours to effect the separation of the dissolved gypsum; at the\r\nsame time the iron contained as impurity in the copper sulphate is\r\nalso precipitated. The purified solution of verdigris is concentrated\r\nand allowed to cool, when a further quantity of gypsum separates; the\r\nsolution is then evaporated to crystallisation.\r\n\r\nIf barium salts and lead acetate are cheap, barium acetate can be\r\nobtained by double decomposition. When copper sulphate is added to\r\nthe solution of barium acetate so long as a precipitate is formed, a\r\nsolution of verdigris is produced, which only requires evaporation\r\nto crystallise. The precipitate is barium sulphate, and can be used\r\nas enamel white. It obstinately retains a quantity of copper, which,\r\nthough small, is sufficient to give it a greenish tint. By several\r\nwashings with acetic acid this copper is removed; the acid can be used\r\nto obtain fresh quantities of verdigris, so that none is lost, and the\r\ncopper retained in the precipitate is regained. The precipitate, after\r\ntreatment with acetic acid, only requires thorough washing with water\r\nto produce permanent white, satisfactory in every respect.\r\n\r\nAmmonia may also be used in the manufacture of verdigris from copper\r\nsulphate. Strong ammonia is left in contact with copper sulphate in\r\na covered vessel for several hours; gentle warming accelerates the\r\nformation of copper ammonium sulphate. The liquid has then a fine blue\r\ncolour; it should not contain sufficient ammonia to be perceptible by\r\nthe smell. It is then gently warmed and acetic acid gradually added.\r\nOn continued heating small green crystals separate from the solution,\r\nwhich is boiled with continual additions of acetic acid in small\r\nquantities until small crystals appear on the surface, when it is\r\nallowed to cool and the crystals are strained off.\r\n\r\n”Distilled” verdigris forms deep bluish-green crystals, which\r\neffloresce slightly in the air; they dissolve in 5 parts of boiling\r\nwater and in 13·4 parts at 20° C. When the solution is boiled for some\r\ntime the tribasic acetate separates; the liquid becomes brown and\r\nacquires an acid reaction.\r\n\r\n=German Verdigris= does not differ essentially from ordinary verdigris.\r\nIt is a compound of the following basic acetates: 2Cu(C₂H₃O₂)₂.CuO\r\nand Cu(C₂H₃O₂)₂.2CuO. The method is similar to that in which grape\r\nresidues are used; where acetic acid is cheap the process is\r\nespecially appropriate. In Sweden, where pyroligneous acid is made\r\nin large quantities and copper is also cheap, verdigris is made by\r\narranging copper plates and flannel in alternate layers. The plates\r\nare frequently turned over and the flannel kept saturated with acetic\r\nacid. The same chemical reactions occur as in the process in which\r\ngrape residues are used. When a layer of verdigris has formed on\r\nthe copper plates they are taken apart, exposed to the air, and\r\nfrequently wetted. The formation of the verdigris is thus completed.\r\nThe difference between this process and that adopted in wine-producing\r\ncountries lies simply in the use of pure acetic acid; the product is\r\nfree from the mechanical impurities introduced by the grape residues.\r\nIn properties German or Swedish verdigris is completely identical with\r\nblue verdigris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nCHROMIUM OXIDE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chrome Green.=—Although very different substances are commercially\r\nknown as chrome green, this name is usually applied to the very\r\nvaluable pigment which consists of pure chromium oxide. There is hardly\r\nanother pigment for the preparation of which such varied directions\r\nhave been given and whose shade varies so much according to the manner\r\nof production.\r\n\r\nThe cheapest process is to ignite potassium bichromate with sulphur,\r\nextract the mass with very dilute sulphuric acid and wash the residue.\r\nThe chromic acid is reduced by the sulphur; when the mass is treated\r\nwith sulphuric acid sulphur dioxide is evolved, potassium sulphide and\r\nsulphate are dissolved, whilst pure chromium oxide remains. The larger\r\nthe quantity of sulphur used the paler is the chromium oxide. The\r\npurity of the potassium bichromate has considerable influence on the\r\nshade of the pigment; if iron is present in any quantity a discoloured\r\nproduct always results. Convenient proportions are: 19 parts of\r\npotassium bichromate and 4 parts of sulphur, which produce 9·33 parts\r\nof chromium oxide. If potassium bichromate free from iron cannot be\r\nobtained, the shade of the product is somewhat improved by treatment\r\nwith dilute hydrochloric acid, in which ferric oxide dissolves more\r\neasily than chromium oxide. When the latter has been strongly ignited\r\nit is soluble with very great difficulty.\r\n\r\nThere are many formulæ for the preparation of chromium oxide by means\r\nof sulphur: in all the above statement holds good, that the more\r\nsulphur the paler the product.\r\n\r\nAccording to A. Casali, a chrome green which satisfies every\r\nrequirement is obtained by strongly igniting 1 part of potassium\r\nbichromate with 3 parts of burnt gypsum. After ignition the mass is\r\nboiled with very dilute hydrochloric acid. In this process the chromic\r\noxide is produced according to the following equation:—\r\n\r\n    2K₂C₂O₇ + CaSO₄ = 2Cr₂O₃ + 2K₂SO₄ + 2CaO + 3O₂.\r\n\r\nOn boiling with hydrochloric acid the lime is dissolved; when the\r\nliquid remains distinctly acid after long boiling it is poured off and\r\nthe chromium oxide washed with hot water and dried.\r\n\r\nIn another method ammonium chromate is very gradually heated. At a\r\ncertain temperature the salt suddenly becomes incandescent and is\r\nconverted into a dark green, almost black, mass which has a very\r\nsimilar appearance to dry tea-leaves. The green obtained after\r\nwashing and powdering is handsomer the lower the temperature of the\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\nChromium oxide may also be made in the wet way, but the product does\r\nnot compare in beauty with that obtained in the dry way. When soda\r\nsolution is added to a solution of chrome alum, a greyish green\r\nprecipitate of chromium hydroxide is formed; on ignition of the washed\r\nprecipitate pure chromium oxide remains.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner chromium oxide is produced by precipitating with\r\nsoda solution the solution of chromium chloride obtained by adding\r\nhydrochloric acid to a solution of potassium bichromate, and then\r\nalcohol in small quantities, so long as a reaction occurs and the green\r\nliquid becomes deeper in colour.\r\n\r\nA handsome and bright chrome green is only obtained when the potassium\r\nbichromate is quite free from iron, a very small quantity of which has\r\na very harmful effect upon the brightness of the pigment. The author\r\nhas found that there is no great difficulty in rendering commercial\r\npotassium bichromate tolerably free from iron by recrystallisation. As\r\nmuch of the salt is dissolved in boiling water as it will take up, the\r\nboiling solution is quickly filtered and rapidly cooled with continual\r\nstirring; the fine crystalline meal is left on a strainer until no more\r\nliquid filters through, and then washed with a little cold water to\r\nremove the mother liquor. The salt obtained by this simple operation is\r\nof great purity and always produces chrome green of a good shade.\r\n\r\nWhen chrome green contains ferric oxide it shows a blackish colour.\r\nFrom such chrome green, which has little value, a product of more pure\r\ncolour can be obtained with a little care. By treatment with dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid the ferric oxide dissolves, even when it has been\r\nsomewhat strongly ignited; chromium oxide loses almost all solubility\r\nin dilute hydrochloric acid after heating at a relatively low\r\ntemperature. To facilitate the solution of the ferric oxide, the green\r\nto be treated is finely powdered; it is then covered with a mixture\r\nof equal parts of hydrochloric acid and water. After several days the\r\nmass is strained and washed with pure water until the acid reaction\r\ndisappears. Comparative analyses have shown that almost the whole of\r\nthe ferric oxide can be removed from chrome green in this manner; the\r\nbrightness of the colour is considerably increased. It is, however,\r\nadvisable to employ materials free from iron in the manufacture of\r\nchrome green.\r\n\r\nChromium oxide can be obtained as a colour of particular brightness,\r\naccording to the process of Leune, by precipitating it very slowly\r\nfrom a solution in which it is contained in the green modification.\r\nFor this purpose a solution of chrome alum is boiled until the violet\r\ncolour has changed to green; the green modification of chromium oxide\r\nis now contained in the solution. It is cooled to about 10° C., and\r\neither freshly precipitated alumina or zinc carbonate added, very\r\ngradually and in small quantities. A fine green shade of chromium oxide\r\nseparates; after washing and drying it is obtained in a condition in\r\nwhich it can be used as a pigment.\r\n\r\nChromium oxide can indeed be obtained by this process, but it is not\r\ndistinguished by particular beauty; the author has never been able\r\nto obtain, even by using the precipitant in very small quantities,\r\na chromium oxide surpassing in shade that obtained by the direct\r\nprecipitation of a chromium salt with an alkali.\r\n\r\nThe emerald green described in the following chapter is obtained in a\r\nsimilar manner by precipitation with zinc oxide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nOTHER GREEN CHROMIUM PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Guignet’s Green= is a chromium oxide made in the dry way; it is\r\nobtained by grinding 1 part of potassium bichromate with 3 parts of\r\npure boric acid and water, drying and heating to a dark red heat\r\nwith access of air. The hot mass is brought into water; by boiling\r\nrepeatedly with water it is freed from the boric acid which it\r\nobstinately retains. In order to remove the last portions of boric acid\r\nit is necessary to boil with sulphuric acid and then with caustic soda;\r\nthis treatment may be omitted for technical purposes, since the small\r\nquantities of boric acid contained in the pigment are not harmful.\r\n\r\nGuignet’s green is distinguished by the great resistance it offers to\r\nchemical reagents; it is largely used in painting and calico printing.\r\nPale shades are obtained by additions of barytes.\r\n\r\n=Emerald Green.=—This pigment must not be confounded with the more\r\nimportant copper compound previously described, to which the name\r\nemerald green is usually applied. It consists of chromium hydroxide\r\nobtained by precipitating a solution of the green modification of a\r\nchromium salt by zinc hydroxide. After careful washing it has a dull\r\ngreen shade; it is a very durable pigment.\r\n\r\n=Chrome Green Lake= is a mixture of chromium oxide with alumina; it\r\nis obtained by precipitating a solution of alum and a chromium salt\r\nby a soda solution. The precipitate, which contains aluminium and\r\nchromium hydroxides, on ignition takes a paler shade in proportion to\r\nthe quantity of alumina it contains. For the chromium salt a solution\r\nof potassium bichromate, which has been allowed to stand with sulphuric\r\nacid and alcohol until if has acquired a pure green colour, may be used.\r\n\r\n=Turkish Green.=—This pigment, which retains its fine green colour in\r\nartificial light, is prepared in a peculiar manner: 40 parts of alumina\r\nfree from iron, 30 parts of cobalt carbonate and 20 parts of chromium\r\noxide are thoroughly ground in a mortar. The mixture is placed in a\r\nporcelain tube, which is exposed to a strong white heat whilst pure\r\noxygen is led through. The oxygen may be replaced by air if it is\r\npreviously heated and under pressure.\r\n\r\nAnother recipe for Turkish green is to intimately mix 4 parts of\r\nfreshly precipitated alumina with 3 parts of cobalt carbonate and\r\n2 parts of chromium oxide, heat the mixture in a crucible at a\r\nwhite heat, powder and levigate. Turkish green has a characteristic\r\nbluish-green colour; the shade is inclined to blue or green by\r\nincreasing the quantity of cobalt carbonate or chromium oxide.\r\n\r\n=Leaf Green= is a pale green, very durable pigment similar to chrome\r\ngreen lake. It is obtained by igniting mixtures of chromium oxide with\r\npure aluminium hydrate; the paleness of the shade is in proportion to\r\nthe amount of alumina.\r\n\r\n=Chromium Phosphate Pigments.=—Several chromium phosphates are used as\r\npigments; the more important are described here.\r\n\r\n=Arnaudan’s Green= is chromium metaphosphate; it is obtained by\r\nintimately mixing 128 parts of neutral ammonium phosphate with 149\r\nparts of potassium bichromate by long grinding, and carefully heating\r\nthe mixture at 170° to 180° C., but not higher, until the mass is pure\r\ngreen. It is then brought into hot water and thoroughly washed; it has\r\na very handsome green colour, which is not altered in artificial light.\r\n\r\nAmmonium arsenate may be used in the place of ammonium phosphate; a\r\nhandsomer green is then obtained, which is, however, very poisonous.\r\n\r\n=Plessy’s Green= is essentially a chromium phosphate mixed with\r\nvariable amounts of chromium oxide and calcium phosphate. It is\r\nobtained by boiling a solution of 1 part of potassium bichromate in 10\r\nparts of water with 3 parts of a solution of acid calcium phosphate and\r\n1 part of sugar, until the whole has become deep green. The chromic\r\nacid is reduced by the sugar, so that the precipitate contains chromium\r\nphosphate, chromium oxide and neutral calcium phosphate.\r\n\r\nThese two chromium phosphate greens are very stable towards chemical\r\nreagents, and very durable towards atmospheric influences.\r\n\r\n=Schnitzer’s Green.=—Thirty-six parts of sodium phosphate are melted\r\nin its water of crystallisation, 15 parts of potassium bichromate\r\nand 14 parts of Rochelle salt are then added. A large dish must be\r\nused for the fusion, since the mass effervesces. The colour changes\r\ngradually from yellow to green. When it is pure green the heating is\r\nstopped, and, after cooling somewhat, as much hydrochloric acid is\r\nadded as the mass will absorb; then, after standing some time, it is\r\nwashed with cold and finally with boiling water. On account of their\r\ngreat durability, the chromium phosphate pigments are well adapted for\r\npaperhangings, calico printing and oil painting.\r\n\r\n=Chromaventurine= is a glass coloured green by chromium oxide. It is\r\nhardly used as a painters’ colour in the ordinary sense of the term;\r\nit is applied in porcelain painting as an under-glaze colour, and is\r\nlargely used for colouring glass.\r\n\r\nChromaventurine is most simply made by the process of Pelouze: 250\r\nparts of quartz sand, 100 parts of soda, 50 parts of calcium carbonate\r\nand 40 parts of potassium bichromate are fused together. The presence\r\nof iron would have a very harmful effect on the shade of the product.\r\nQuartz sand generally contains a small quantity of ferric oxide, which\r\nshould be extracted by treatment with strong hydrochloric acid when a\r\nproduct of the best colour is required. The calcium carbonate should\r\nalso, as far as possible, be free from ferric oxide.\r\n\r\n=Chrome Blue= (Garnier).—A mixture of 48·62 parts of potassium chromate\r\nwith 65 parts of fluorspar and 157 parts of silica is fused in a\r\ncrucible lined with coal-dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nGREEN COBALT PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom mixtures of chromium oxide, cobalt carbonate and alumina in\r\ndifferent proportions a series of pigments can be obtained varying\r\nin shade between pale blue and bluish-green. On account of the great\r\nstability of these colours at the highest temperatures they are of\r\ngreat importance in porcelain painting, for which they are principally\r\nused. It is necessary that the porcelain should be free from iron,\r\nsince ferric oxide forms a black compound with chromium oxide, very\r\nsmall quantities of which would be sufficient to considerably damage\r\nthe fineness of the colour.\r\n\r\n=Cobalt Green=, which is also known as Rinmann’s green or zinc green,\r\nis a compound of the oxides of cobalt and zinc. It is always produced\r\nwhen a cobalt compound is ignited with zinc oxide. Rinmann’s green\r\nhas not so deep a colour as the poisonous emerald green, but it is\r\ndistinguished by extraordinary durability, and deserves to be more\r\nlargely used than it is at present. This pigment is most simply made by\r\nprecipitating the mixed solutions of a zinc salt and a cobalt salt. It\r\nis also formed by moistening pure zinc oxide with a cobalt solution and\r\nigniting.\r\n\r\nIn precipitating the mixed solutions of zinc and cobalt salts products\r\nof different shades are obtained, according to the proportions in\r\nwhich the salts are used. If equivalent quantities are used, an almost\r\nblack product is obtained, quite useless as an artists’ colour. The\r\nbest result is obtained by mixing intimately pure precipitated cobalt\r\ncarbonate with zinc oxide and igniting the mixture; a mixture of 9 to\r\n10 parts of zinc oxide with 1 to 1·5 part of cobalt carbonate gives\r\ncolours between pale green and dark green.\r\n\r\nEspecially fine Rinmann’s green is obtained by igniting cobalt arsenate\r\nwith zinc oxide and arsenious acid. The addition of the last-named\r\nsubstance can only have the object of preventing the temperature from\r\nrising too high, which might injure the beauty of the colour; arsenious\r\nacid is volatile at a fairly low temperature.\r\n\r\nCobalt green is also obtained by evaporating a solution of cobalt\r\nnitrate and zinc nitrate and igniting the residue, or by igniting\r\na mixture of the sulphates. In the latter case a tolerably high\r\ntemperature is necessary in order that the sulphates may be decomposed.\r\n\r\nThe author has found that a particularly handsome product is obtained\r\nby mixing pure zinc oxide with a dilute solution of cobalt chloride,\r\ndrying and then slowly heating to redness in a crucible with a\r\nwell-fitting lid. Towards the end of the operation the heat is\r\nconsiderably increased and maintained for a short time, after which the\r\nmass is rapidly cooled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nGREEN MANGANESE PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Manganese Green, Rosenstiehl’s Green.=—This pigment, which is handsome\r\nbut difficult to produce, consists of barium manganate. It can be\r\nobtained by several methods, all of which produce a good green, but\r\nwith very unequal properties. Manganese green made from barium nitrate\r\nhas little durability; when made from barium hydrate it is more costly,\r\nbut very durable.\r\n\r\nBarium manganate is most easily obtained by precipitating a boiling\r\nsolution of potassium manganate by barium chloride. The almost blue\r\nprecipitate becomes nearly white when washed and dried, but when it is\r\ngradually heated on a porcelain plate to a dark red heat it acquires\r\na fine green colour. The heating must be carefully conducted; if the\r\ntemperature rises too high, the colour changes to a dirty greyish\r\nbrown, owing to the reduction of the manganic acid.\r\n\r\nThis pigment is also made by heating 14 parts of manganic oxide, 80\r\nparts of barium nitrate and 6 parts of barytes with access of air until\r\nthe desired shade appears. The mass is then ground in a continuous\r\ncurrent of water until it is changed into a very fine powder and\r\nnothing more is dissolved by the water. The best result is obtained\r\nby Rosenstiehl’s process: 4 parts of barium hydrate, 2 parts of\r\nfinely-powdered barium nitrate and 0·5 part of artificial manganese\r\ndioxide are rapidly mixed; the mixture is moistened and heated to a\r\ndark red heat. The fused mass is boiled out with water and the residue\r\ndried under a bell jar, under which are dishes of sulphuric acid and\r\ncaustic potash, the former of which absorbs the water, whilst the\r\nlatter keeps the air free from carbonic acid, which would injure the\r\nshade of the moist substance.\r\n\r\nManganese green is amongst the pigments more recently discovered.\r\nOn account of its high price it has found but limited use up to the\r\npresent. It may be used in any vehicle, and is distinguished by great\r\npermanence.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the preparation of this colour by Rosenstiehl’s method,\r\nwhich of all gives the best results, it should be observed that the\r\nshade largely depends on the quantity of barium hydrate used; the\r\ngreater this is the more the shade inclines to blue. If it is desired\r\nto produce a colour of a greener tone than is produced by the fusion,\r\nthis can be accomplished by boiling for a very long time with very\r\nweak hydrochloric acid, which extracts a portion of the base from the\r\ncompound and produces a deeper shade.\r\n\r\n=Böttger’s Barium Green.=—A beautiful green is obtained by the process\r\ngiven by Böttger, as the author has found. It consists of barium\r\nmanganate. The process is, however, somewhat costly, so that the\r\npigment would only be available for artists’ purposes.\r\n\r\nA solution of potassium manganate is first made by gradually adding 2\r\nparts of very pure pyrolusite, finely powdered, to a fused mixture of\r\n2 parts of caustic potash and 1 part of potassium chlorate, bringing\r\nthe mass to a low red heat after the introduction of the whole of the\r\npyrolusite, and finally extracting with water, in which the potassium\r\nmanganate dissolves to a fine emerald green solution. This process\r\nis unattended by difficulty if the pyrolusite contains a sufficient\r\nquantity of manganese peroxide and is in a sufficiently fine powder,\r\nwhich is most important. Potassium manganate is a very unstable\r\nsubstance. Cold water must be used to dissolve it, and the solution\r\nshould not long stand exposed to the air, but should at once be used to\r\nobtain barium manganate.\r\n\r\nWhen the solution of potassium manganate is mixed with a solution of a\r\nbarium salt, a handsome violet precipitate immediately forms. This is\r\nwashed with water and quickly ground with ¾ to 1 part of its weight of\r\nbarium hydrate. The mixture is heated in a copper dish with constant\r\nstirring to a low red heat; the colour changes gradually to a very fine\r\ngreen. When the mass has reached the proper shade it is treated with\r\ncold water to remove excess of barium hydrate, until the washings show\r\nno trace of alkaline reaction.\r\n\r\n=Manganous Oxide= is occasionally used as a green pigment, especially\r\nfor painting metal work; it is obtained in the following manner:\r\nManganese sulphate solution is precipitated by soda solution, and\r\nthe manganous carbonate obtained strongly ignited in a crucible. In\r\norder to avoid oxidation of the manganous oxide, which would readily\r\noccur in the process, it is necessary to prevent air from reaching\r\nthe substance. With this object the crucible in which the heating is\r\nconducted is covered by another from which the bottom has been removed\r\nand which is filled with coal. The air entering the crucible on cooling\r\nmust pass through the layer of glowing coals, by which it is deprived\r\nof oxygen.\r\n\r\n=Manganese Blue= is obtained, according to G. Bong, by igniting a\r\nmixture of 3 parts of quartz, 6 parts of soda ash, 5 parts of limestone\r\nand 3 parts of manganese oxide, or of 3 parts of quartz, 8 parts of\r\nbarium nitrate and 3 parts of manganese oxide, air being admitted and\r\nreducing gases excluded. All materials must be free from iron. The\r\nquantity of manganese oxide regulates the depth of the colour, but not\r\nits shade; by increasing the soda a greener, by increasing the quartz a\r\nmore violet, shade is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nCOMPOUNDED GREEN PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMixtures of a yellow and a blue pigment produce a green; according as\r\none or the other predominates colours are obtained inclining to yellow\r\nor blue.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the mixing can be accomplished in the actual production\r\nof the pigments, so that a green precipitate is directly produced.\r\nThis is, however, rarely the case; generally the compound pigments\r\nare obtained by simply mixing the two colours. The mixing can be done\r\neither in the dry or the wet way; colours in the wet state are more\r\neasily mixed than when dry, so that even when dry colours are employed\r\nthe mixing is done with the addition of water. Although the mixture\r\nthen requires a second drying, this method is still to be recommended,\r\nin the first place, because the mixing can be more quickly done in\r\nconsequence of the greater mobility of the mass, and in the second,\r\nbecause the formation of poisonous dust is completely avoided.\r\n\r\nThe mixing is generally accomplished by mechanical arrangements. If\r\ndry colours are to be mixed, rotating cylinders may be used; these are\r\nfilled with the materials to be mixed, well closed and rotated about\r\nthe axis as long as may be necessary. It should be observed that when\r\ncolours which have a very different specific gravity, such as chrome\r\nyellow and Prussian blue, are to be mixed, the cylinders must be\r\nrotated for a much longer time than when colours of approximately equal\r\nspecific gravity are to be united.\r\n\r\nIn working in the wet way, which is to be preferred, sufficient water\r\nis added to the colours to make a paste thin enough to be mixed by\r\nspatulas; the mixture is thoroughly stirred and the pulp ground in\r\nordinary mills until the mixture is quite uniform. Already whilst on\r\nthe mills the pulp becomes thicker in consequence of evaporation; when\r\nthe grinding is finished it is spread out in thin layers so that it may\r\ndry as quickly as possible. This is important in the case of mixtures\r\nwhose constituents have very different specific gravities, otherwise\r\nthe heavier pigment may sink to the bottom of the paste and the mass\r\nthus lose its uniformity.\r\n\r\nThe compound green pigments come into the market under most varied\r\nnames, which are often entirely without connection with their chemical\r\ncomposition. Such names are: mineral green, English green, oil green,\r\ngreen vermilion; the most common are chrome green and Brunswick green.\r\nIt should be noted that these names are more strictly applied to simple\r\ncolours previously described.\r\n\r\n=Chrome Green= is generally made by mixing deep chrome yellow and\r\nPrussian blue; it can naturally be obtained in all possible shades.\r\nThe brightness of this already handsome pigment can be considerably\r\nincreased by the addition of a small quantity of indigo carmine. In\r\nthis case the mixing is best done by adding a solution of the indigo\r\ncarmine to the stiff paste and again sending the mixture through the\r\nmill.\r\n\r\nBy additions of white substances paler shades of chrome green are\r\nobtained; levigated terra alba or white pipe clay can be advantageously\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n=Elsner’s Chrome Green= is obtained by preparing a solution of yellow\r\nprussiate of potash and potassium chromate and another solution of lead\r\nacetate and ferric chloride. The two liquids are mixed with vigorous\r\nstirring; according to the proportions of the materials a blue or a\r\nyellow shade of green is produced.\r\n\r\n=Silk Green.=—Forty-one parts of lead nitrate are dissolved in 20 to 30\r\ntimes the weight of water, the solution is boiled in a copper pan, and,\r\naccording to the shade required, 10 to 30 parts of fine Chinese blue\r\nare added. After well stirring, a solution of 10 parts of potassium\r\nbichromate and 1 part of nitric acid is poured into the boiling liquid,\r\nthe mixture is again well stirred, the precipitate allowed to settle,\r\nwashed and dried. The green pigment obtained in this way has a peculiar\r\nsilky lustre, hence the name ”silk green”.\r\n\r\n=Natural Green= is a mixture of Guignet’s green with picric acid; it is\r\nused in making artificial flowers instead of emerald green.\r\n\r\n=Non-arsenical Green= was proposed as a substitute for emerald green,\r\nwhich, however, it does not equal in brilliance. It is obtained by\r\nmixing copper blue (basic copper carbonate) with chrome yellow, chalk\r\nand ferric oxide, in somewhat variable proportions. It usually contains\r\n80 to 82 per cent. of the copper compound and 13 to 15 per cent. of\r\nchrome yellow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn making mixtures of pigments it is to be remembered that chemical\r\nactions may occur in the mixture; colours which act upon one another\r\nshould not be mixed: the mixture would contain the cause of its own\r\ndestruction. For example, a lead pigment should not be mixed with one\r\ncontaining sulphur in the form of a sulphide or sulphate. By following\r\nthis important rule the number of pigments which may be mixed together\r\nis considerably diminished; the advantage is that durable colours are\r\nproduced, which do not change in a short time to an unrecognisable\r\nshade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nVIOLET MINERAL PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chromic Chloride.=—The violet modification of chromic chloride is\r\na compound which is little used, but deserves the highest attention\r\non account of its durability and beauty of shade. Up to the present\r\nchromic chloride has been almost exclusively used for colouring paper\r\nhangings under the name of chrome bronze, which it has received in\r\nconsequence of its property of imparting a peculiar metallic lustre\r\nto paper upon which it is rubbed. It is also possible to fix this\r\nsubstance upon fabrics, which thus acquire a similar metallic lustre.\r\n\r\nPure chromic chloride forms beautiful peach-blossom coloured scales,\r\nwhich can only be obtained by treating chromium oxide in a certain\r\nmanner with chlorine. The pure substance is practically insoluble in\r\nwater, but if the water contains but a trace of chromous chloride\r\nthe chromic chloride readily dissolves to a green solution. In the\r\npreparation of this compound it is necessary to avoid the least trace\r\nof chromous chloride, otherwise the product will begin to change when\r\nit comes into contact with moist air.\r\n\r\nPure chromic chloride is obtained by proceeding according to the method\r\nfirst given by Wöhler: the simple apparatus necessary is depicted in\r\nFig. 29. Pure chromic oxide is first made by any suitable process;\r\nthis is made into a paste with charcoal, starch paste and water, and\r\nformed into small balls which are heated in a crucible to a white heat.\r\nThe residual intimate mixture of chromic oxide and carbon is loosely\r\nplaced in a crucible which stands in a furnace; a porcelain tube is\r\ncemented into the bottom of the crucible, it passes through the ashpit\r\nto connect with a chlorine apparatus. Upon the crucible another larger\r\none is placed, which has a small opening in the bottom and serves as\r\na receiver for the sublimed chromic chloride. The heating and current\r\nof chlorine are started at the same time, the fire is regulated so\r\nthat the lower crucible glows brightly. This is continued for an hour,\r\nduring which a rapid current of chlorine must pass into the crucible;\r\nthe fire is then removed and a slow current of chlorine passed through\r\nthe apparatus until it is quite cold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.]\r\n\r\nIf the operation has succeeded the lower crucible is found empty and\r\nthe interior of the upper covered with the magnificent peach-blossom\r\ncrystals of chromic chloride. A small quantity of the chromic chloride\r\nis tested as to its behaviour towards water; if it remains unaltered\r\nthe whole may be washed, but if it dissolves to a green solution\r\nit must be again ignited in a current of chlorine. The washing is\r\nnecessary to remove small quantities of aluminium chloride formed by\r\nthe action of chlorine on the clay of the crucible.\r\n\r\n=Manganese Violet, or Nuremberg Violet=, consists of manganic\r\nphosphate. It is obtained by fusing glacial phosphoric acid with pure\r\npyrolusite, boiling the melt with ammonium carbonate, filtering the\r\nsolution, evaporating to dryness, and again fusing the residue. After\r\nboiling with water this forms a handsome violet powder; it is suitable\r\nfor use as a very durable artists’ colour.\r\n\r\nShades of this pigment inclining to blue are obtained when a ferric\r\ncompound is added in the first fusion; the more iron ore is used the\r\nmore intense is the blue tone.\r\n\r\n=Tin Violet or Mineral Lake= is obtained as a violet mass by igniting\r\nan intimate mixture of 100 parts of tin dioxide with 2 parts of chromic\r\noxide. This pigment is completely permanent in air; it is suitable for\r\nprinting paper hangings and for colouring faience.\r\n\r\n=Copper Violet, Guyard’s Violet.=—According to J. Depierre, this\r\npigment is obtained by precipitating a solution of copper ammonium\r\nsulphate with potassium ferrocyanide, washing and drying the\r\nprecipitate and heating in a porcelain dish. At 170° C. cyanogen and\r\nammonia are evolved, the mass takes up oxygen and becomes violet; it\r\nthen resists the action of dilute acids and alkalis, and as a pigment\r\nhas great covering power. On heating to 200° C. it turns blue, and at\r\n240° to 250° C. becomes greenish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nBROWN MINERAL PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lead Brown.=—When red lead is treated with nitric acid, lead monoxide\r\nis dissolved, whilst deep brown lead peroxide remains. When the action\r\nof the nitric acid is finished the residue is well washed and dried.\r\nLead peroxide is now extensively used for lucifer matches; it readily\r\ngives up oxygen on heating, and thus accelerates the ignition of the\r\ncomposition. Brown match-heads owe their colour to lead peroxide.\r\n\r\n=Manganese Brown= consists of manganic oxide; it occurs in nature, but\r\nseldom in a state of sufficient purity to be used as a pigment; it is,\r\ntherefore, generally made artificially. The process is very simple.\r\nA solution of manganese sulphate is precipitated by caustic soda\r\nsolution, the manganous hydroxide produced is quickly changed by the\r\naction of the air into manganic hydroxide. The colour is most rapidly\r\ndeveloped when the precipitate is spread out in thin layers; it is well\r\nwashed after it has changed to brown.\r\n\r\n=Pyrolusite Brown= is manganese peroxide in a state of fine division.\r\nIt can be made from the residual liquors of the preparation of chlorine\r\nby adding sodium hypochlorite. A brown precipitate results, which is\r\nkept in contact with the liquid until it no longer changes in colour.\r\nIt is then washed with water slightly acidified with sulphuric acid,\r\nand finally with pure water. When finely powdered, manganese peroxide\r\nhas a very fine brown colour. It is quite unaltered by the air and\r\nthus, in consideration of its cheapness, deserves a much greater use\r\nthan it has yet found.\r\n\r\n=Prussian Brown.=—When Prussian blue is heated in air it soon begins to\r\nglow, and is converted into a brown mass, the shade of which depends\r\non the amount of impurity in the Prussian blue. It is desirable to use\r\nPrussian blue quite free from impurities, so that a brown of the same\r\nshade is always obtained. The brown obtained can be shaded by additions\r\nof indifferent substances.\r\n\r\n=Iron Brown.=—By igniting a mixture of 100 parts of finely levigated\r\nnatural yellow ochre with 5 parts of common salt a brown product is\r\nobtained, which is pale or deep according to the temperature used. It\r\nis a cheap and durable colour.\r\n\r\n=Copper Brown.=—According to Cartheuser solutions of 2 parts of copper\r\nsulphate and 1 part of Epsom salts are mixed, and a strong solution of\r\npotassium carbonate gradually added so long as a precipitate forms. The\r\nprecipitate is washed, dried and ignited, when copper brown is obtained\r\nas a brown powder of great permanence in air.\r\n\r\nAccording to Schreger solutions of 2 parts of copper sulphate, 2 parts\r\nof alum and 0·5 to 1 part of ferrous sulphate are mixed, potassium\r\ncarbonate solution added, the precipitate dried and ignited. The\r\nredness of the shade is proportional to the quantity of ferrous\r\nsulphate.\r\n\r\n=Hatchett Brown= is copper potassium ferrocyanide. It is obtained by\r\nprecipitating a soluble copper salt with potassium ferrocyanide. Copper\r\nsalts behave towards potassium ferrocyanide in the same manner as iron\r\nsalts; different compounds result according as the ferrocyanide or the\r\ncopper salt is in excess. Hatchett brown is somewhat largely used for\r\npainting wood.\r\n\r\n=Chrome Brown.=—When solutions of potassium chromate and a copper\r\nsalt are mixed a precipitate of the composition CuCrO₄.2CuO.2H₂O is\r\nobtained. On drying it acquires a fine brown colour; it forms a very\r\nstable pigment.\r\n\r\nChrome brown can also be made by dissolving 10 parts of potassium\r\nbichromate in 20 parts of water, heating to boiling, adding 13·5 parts\r\nof solid copper chloride and then gradually a boiling solution of 10\r\nparts of soda in 20 parts of water, until effervescence no longer takes\r\nplace. On cooling, chrome brown separates as a soft brown precipitate.\r\n\r\n=Cobalt Brown= is a very durable compound pigment of a pleasing shade.\r\nIt is obtained in various hues by adding ferric oxide to the mixture\r\nof alumina and a cobalt salt used for making cobalt blue. The process\r\nmay also be carried out by igniting ammonia alum with cobalt sulphate\r\nand ferrous sulphate. The temperature required in this case to obtain a\r\nbright colour is very high, and must be maintained for a long time to\r\ndecompose the whole of the ferrous sulphate.\r\n\r\nThe pigment can be obtained at a far lower temperature when ferric\r\nchloride is used in place of ferrous sulphate. The mixture is made by\r\ngrinding together 5 parts of cobalt hydroxide and 25 parts of ammonia\r\nalum, then adding a solution of ferric chloride, rapidly drying the\r\nwhole to a powder, and whilst still hot filling it into the crucible\r\nin which the ignition is performed. When small quantities of ferric\r\nchloride are used chocolate brown shades inclining to violet are\r\nproduced; the larger the quantity of the iron compound the more pure is\r\nthe brown.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that it is important, in the preparation of cobalt\r\npigments, to prevent the entry of fire gases to the heated mixture;\r\nthe reducing action of the gases would materially damage the beauty\r\nof the colour. It has been proposed to place a small quantity of\r\nmercuric oxide at the bottom of the crucible. This would decompose\r\non heating, and create an atmosphere of pure oxygen in the crucible.\r\nApart from the cost of the mercuric oxide, which is considerable, it\r\nwould only be effective at the commencement of the operation, since it\r\nis completely decomposed at a low red heat. The author has found an\r\naddition of pyrolusite considerably more effective. This may be applied\r\nby spreading a small quantity, about 5 per cent. of the mixture to be\r\nheated, on the bottom of the crucible and covering it with powdered\r\nglass, upon which the colour mixture is placed. An alternative course\r\nis to place the crucible in a second, filling the space between the\r\ncrucibles with powdered pyrolusite. At a strong red heat oxygen is\r\nslowly evolved from the pyrolusite; the entry of fire gases into the\r\ncrucible is thus prevented. In using the first method the crucible\r\nis frequently spoilt, whilst in the second method the surrounding\r\npyrolusite protects it, so that it can be used again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nBROWN DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Humins.=—Wood decomposes, like many other substances of organic\r\norigin, to form compounds of a deep brown colour, which are known as\r\nhumins, on account of their occurrence in the humus of tilled soil. The\r\nnumerous compounds found in humus have all a deep brown colour, which,\r\ntogether with their great stability, makes them very suitable for use\r\nas pigments.\r\n\r\nBy various methods substances can be made so rich in humins that they\r\ncan be used as pigments. For this purpose sugar, starch, young plant\r\nfibres and beet-sugar molasses may be used, which are converted into\r\nhumins with great rapidity when they are heated with water. In this\r\nway the author has obtained handsome colours from sawdust. These\r\nhumins are most easily made by the following process: Thick beet-sugar\r\nmolasses are cautiously heated with 5 per cent. of caustic soda in\r\na very capacious iron pan. The already dark mass soon becomes quite\r\nblack when seen in thick layers, and evolves a considerable quantity\r\nof gas; if the heating is too rapid the soft mass may boil over out\r\nof a very large vessel. When the evolution of gas diminishes the heat\r\nis increased and the mass frequently stirred. With some practice it\r\nis possible to tell when the action is finished from the smell, which\r\nis at first sweetish but later of a characteristic nature. At first\r\ntests should be repeatedly taken from the mass; these are considerably\r\ndiluted with water until the liquid begins to be transparent. When two\r\ntests taken at an interval show no difference of colour the heating is\r\nstopped. The whole mass is then poured into water in order to dilute\r\nthe alkali, so that it will not destroy the strainer; the soft mass,\r\nwhich in the wet state appears quite black, is washed with water until\r\nthe washings are neutral. The humin brown made in this way, when ground\r\nwith oil or gum solution, produces a very handsome brown of great\r\ncovering power and warmth of shade, also distinguished by complete\r\nindifference towards chemical reagents.\r\n\r\nThe pigments we have designated humins contain a very large quantity\r\nof carbon, to which they owe their dark colour. When peat or lignite\r\nis treated with caustic soda in a similar manner, good shades of brown\r\nare obtained; they are, however, surpassed in beauty by the brown\r\nfrom molasses. A handsome but costly brown is obtained when crude\r\nspirits of wine are heated with fuming sulphuric acid. Equal volumes\r\nof alcohol and sulphuric acid are used; the mixture is heated in a\r\nretort connected to a condenser, which is required on account of the\r\ncombustible vapours evolved from the mixture. When the mass is quite\r\nblack the heat is withdrawn; the residue is diluted with water, and\r\nsoda solution added so long as effervescence occurs. On filtering a\r\nvery soft brown powder is left, which forms a very handsome and durable\r\npigment.\r\n\r\n=Bistre.=—When soot is produced at a very low temperature it is very\r\nlustrous, and, in addition to carbon, contains a notable quantity\r\nof the products of dry distillation. When this soot is powdered and\r\ntreated with water the latter substances are dissolved; boiling water\r\nshould be used. When water is no longer coloured the soot is suspended\r\nin a large quantity of water and subjected to a process of levigation.\r\nThe fine powder obtained by repeated levigation has, when dry, an ugly\r\nbrown colour, but when ground it acquires an extremely warm shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nBLACK PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbon occurs in nature in many different forms—the diamond, graphite\r\n(black lead), and purified lamp black are, from the chemical point of\r\nview, one and the same substance, namely, carbon. In colour making the\r\nnon-crystalline form of carbon, which is pure black, is alone used;\r\nalmost all black pigments used in painting are composed of tolerably\r\npure carbon. In whatever way and from whatever materials carbon is made\r\nfor use as a pigment, the manufacturer must always endeavour to obtain\r\nit as pure as possible, and in a condition of the finest division; the\r\ndepth of colour and the covering power depend on these two conditions.\r\nCarbon only shows a pure black colour when it is pure; if it contains\r\nrelatively small quantities of impurities, it has a more or less brown\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it appears to be a very simple matter to obtain black\r\npigments from organic materials; it is simply necessary to expose them\r\nin the absence of air to a temperature high enough to decompose them,\r\ncarbon is then left as a residue. In spite of the apparent simplicity\r\nof this operation there are many difficulties. The preparation of good\r\nblack pigments demands considerable practice.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods by which carbon can be made for use as a pigment.\r\nOne has been indicated, the heating of organic materials in the absence\r\nof air, _i.e._, their dry distillation; the second, which produces the\r\nbest qualities of black, consists in burning substances very rich in\r\ncarbon with a very small supply of air. The product of this process,\r\ncommonly known as soot, is very different in external appearance from\r\ncarbon made by dry distillation. The latter forms an easily powdered\r\nmass, which only acquires lustre by grinding with oil, whilst soot\r\nconsists generally of very light flocks, which, in consequence of their\r\ngreasy nature, exhibit a peculiar velvety lustre.\r\n\r\nIn commerce there are many qualities of black, the names of which are\r\ngenerally chosen quite arbitrarily. The so-called ivory black is an\r\nexample of this. At some period it was observed that ivory produced a\r\nvery fine black when carbonised; this black was made for a long time\r\nfrom refuse ivory. When it was found that a similar black could be\r\nmade quite as well from much cheaper materials, it was no longer made\r\nfrom ivory. The name, however, remains in trade to the present day: it\r\nhas come to be regarded as a description of quality. By the name of\r\nivory black a fine black pigment is understood; it is immaterial to the\r\nconsumer whether it is made from ivory or not: to him the quality of\r\nthe pigment, but not its source, is important.\r\n\r\nAccording to the method of production, the black pigments can be\r\ndivided into charcoal blacks and soot blacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARCOAL BLACKS.\r\n\r\nThis term is applied to the pigments obtained by heating organic\r\nsubstances in the absence of air. The charcoal blacks have two valuable\r\nproperties: they are easily made, and they exhibit a pure black shade\r\nwhich it is far more difficult to obtain with the soot blacks. It is\r\nvery difficult to convert these pigments into the requisite state\r\nof fine division. They cannot be levigated on account of their low\r\nspecific gravity, which causes them to settle very slowly in water.\r\nIt only remains to convert the charcoal into a very soft powder\r\nby grinding, but even then the pigment has but little covering\r\npower, because it is not possible to destroy the organic structure\r\nof the substance carbonised. When the finest charcoal powder, made\r\nby carbonising any organic substance, is examined under a powerful\r\nmicroscope the structure of the particles is at once recognised, so\r\nthat it is almost always possible to decide whether the charcoal is\r\nof plant or animal origin. A very careful examination may show what\r\nparticular part of the plant has been carbonised. If a manufacturer\r\nsucceeded in producing by direct carbonisation a black with the\r\ncovering power of a soot black, that black would soon be the only one\r\nfound in commerce.\r\n\r\nThe charcoal blacks come on the market under various names—ivory black,\r\nbone black, vine black, Frankfort black, Paris black, etc. The ivory\r\nblacks are the best quality, but recently true vine black, _i.e._, made\r\nfrom grape residues, has come into use.\r\n\r\n=True Charcoal Black.=—In charcoal-burning wood is burned in great\r\npiles with restricted air supply; the greater part of the carbon\r\ncontained in the wood remains behind as charcoal, which is used for\r\nfuel. The charcoal made from hard wood, such as maple or beech, is not\r\nwell suited for pigments; the lighter and more porous the wood, the\r\nmore pure is generally the shade of the charcoal, and the more easily\r\nit can be ground. When, therefore, charcoal is to be used as a pigment\r\nit should be made from wood of a porous nature; the wood of the lime,\r\nblack-alder and spindle tree is particularly adapted for this purpose.\r\nSpent tan-bark is a very cheap, and at the same time suitable material\r\nfor this purpose. It generally consists of oak bark, and has lost the\r\ngreater part of the salts it contained by long contact with water;\r\nalso the woody substance of the bark has suffered a change which is\r\nfavourable to carbonisation. This is especially the case when the bark\r\nhas been stored for some time; a considerable quantity of the humins\r\npreviously mentioned has formed in it, and these are easily decomposed\r\nat a low temperature.\r\n\r\nThe charcoal, however obtained, is ground to a soft powder. When it has\r\nreached the proper degree of fineness it should be repeatedly washed\r\nwith water to remove the salts. When instead of pure water a very\r\ndilute acid, such as hydrochloric, is used, practically all the salts\r\ndissolve, and the residue consists of nearly pure carbon.\r\n\r\n=Vine Black.=—In wine-producing countries a good and cheap black can be\r\nmade from the residues of the wine manufacture; this is the so-called\r\nvine black. Either the pressed grapes or the lees separated in the\r\nfermenting vessels may be used.\r\n\r\n_Vine Black from Wine Lees._—The lees always contain a considerable\r\nquantity of liquid, they must be thoroughly dried before they are\r\ncarbonised; this is most simply done by spreading out the pasty mass in\r\na thin layer, and exposing it to a temperature of about 100° to 120° C.\r\nIn drying the volume considerably diminishes. The lees are changed into\r\na brown mass which is easily powdered; it is packed into barrels while\r\nstill warm, and can be kept for a considerable time without alteration.\r\nFresh lees can be kept but a short time; they are quickly destroyed by\r\na rapid fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe dried lees are carbonised in iron tubes, protected from the\r\nfire by a thin coating of clay mixed with chopped hair so that the\r\ncoat more readily adheres to the iron. Old stove pipes or cast-iron\r\ngas or water pipes may be used. The tubes are about one metre long;\r\nthey are closed with well-fitting covers, in one of which is a small\r\nopening through which the gases produced on heating can escape. These\r\ncovers are fastened on air-tight with clay. The process begins by\r\naffixing the unperforated lid, and packing with a wooden rammer the\r\ndry lees as tightly as possible into the tube; the second lid is then\r\nluted in place. The tubes are placed near one another in a suitable\r\nfurnace and first slowly heated at the back, _i.e._, the end closed\r\nby the unperforated cover. At the commencement of the operation heat\r\nmust be gradually applied. With too large a fire the products of\r\ndry distillation might be evolved in sufficient quantity to force\r\nthe covers from the tube; air would then enter and the contents be\r\nburnt. When the hinder part of the tube is red-hot, the heating is\r\nconducted forward, and finally the whole length of the tube is brought\r\nto a good red heat. The termination of the operation is shown by the\r\ndisappearance of the pointed flame of the products of distillation\r\nwhich protrudes from the opening in the cover of the tube. When this\r\noccurs, the fires are drawn; the tubes are left to cool in the furnace\r\nuntil they can be taken out by the hands protected by wet cloths. The\r\ncovers are at once taken off and the hot contents emptied into a large\r\ntub filled with water, which is thus soon raised almost to boiling\r\npoint. The time required for washing is thus considerably shortened.\r\nThe charcoal falls from the tubes in lumps, which soon fall to a fine\r\npowder in the water. Wine lees consist of a mixture of yeast cells and\r\nsmall crystals of tartar (a mixture of the tartrates of potassium and\r\ncalcium). On ignition these salts are converted into carbonates, by\r\nwhich the particles of carbon are united. Potassium carbonate is very\r\nreadily soluble in water; in contact with the warm water it dissolves\r\nin a very short time, the carbon particles then fall apart.\r\n\r\nWhen the charcoal has settled to the bottom of the vessel the liquid\r\nis drawn off. It can be utilised in a colour works, since it is a\r\nfairly strong solution of potassium carbonate. The charcoal is mixed\r\nwith calcium carbonate, arising from the decomposition of the calcium\r\ntartrate, and with the other insoluble salts which yeast ashes contain\r\nin some quantity. These salts would prevent the proper grinding of the\r\ncharcoal; they are therefore removed by treatment with hydrochloric\r\nacid after the water has been drawn off as completely as possible.\r\nA small quantity of hydrochloric acid, diluted with an equal volume\r\nof water, is poured over the charcoal, an effervescence of carbonic\r\nacid follows, the easily soluble calcium chloride is formed and the\r\nremaining salts are also dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe charcoal made in this way is very pure. After washing, grinding and\r\ndrying, it forms a pigment whose shade leaves nothing to be desired.\r\nThe drying must be conducted at a low temperature; charcoal in such a\r\nfine state of division is very easily inflammable.\r\n\r\n_Vine Black from Pressed Grapes._—The material contains the stems\r\nand pressed remains of the grapes after the must has been expressed.\r\nAfter-wine, spirits or vinegar can be obtained before it is used for\r\nvine black. The process is exactly the same as for wine lees. The\r\ncharcoal taken from the tubes has rather more coherence than that made\r\nfrom lees and must be ground. The black is a very useful pigment, but\r\nis inferior to the black from lees. In regard to the latter, it should\r\nbe stated that it is a particularly good black pigment, and when finely\r\nground is as well suited for the preparation of the finest blacks, such\r\nas are used in copper-plate printing, as the far more costly soot black.\r\n\r\nThe black from grape residues, or from grapes themselves (the poor\r\ngrapes removed in pruning the vine are used), can be employed with\r\nadvantage for many purposes for which the best black is not necessary.\r\nThe greater number of the pigments sold under the names of Frankfort\r\nand Paris black consist of this substance.\r\n\r\n=Bone Black or Ivory Black.=—Bone black, for of ivory black only the\r\nname now exists, is distinguished by a peculiar quality which it owes\r\nto the structure of the raw material from which it is made. This raw\r\nmaterial is animal bones, which largely consist of incombustible\r\nmaterials (bone ash); these form a delicate framework whose interstices\r\nare filled by organic matter. When bones are carbonised, the carbon\r\nresulting from the decomposition of the organic matter is deposited on\r\nthe incombustible framework of bone ash and thus acquires a very great\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nCarbon is well known to possess very powerful absorptive properties,\r\nwhich are especially developed in bone black, in consequence of its\r\nfine division. The use of granular bone black (known as ”char”) in\r\nsugar works, and generally for decolourising liquids, is due to the\r\npeculiar state of division of the charcoal. For these purposes bone\r\nblack is used in enormous quantities; it is made in special works.\r\nIt does not fall within the scope of this work to give a detailed\r\ndescription of the manufacture of bone black, and we must here restrict\r\nourselves to matters of special interest to the colour maker.\r\n\r\nThe bones are coarsely powdered and freed from fat by boiling; they are\r\nthen generally carbonised in iron retorts, a number of which are built\r\nin a furnace in a vertical position; a valve at the bottom serves to\r\nempty the retorts. In a well arranged apparatus the products of the dry\r\ndistillation of the bones, chiefly consisting of ammonium carbonate,\r\nare collected. The retorts are carefully closed so that air cannot\r\nenter, otherwise a portion of the carbon would burn and the black would\r\nacquire a grey shade instead of the pure black which it should possess.\r\n\r\nBone black makers who work for sugar factories carbonise by preference\r\nthe densest bones; these produce a black of the most powerful\r\ndecolourising properties. This property is of no advantage to the\r\ncolour maker, who simply requires a very dense black. The bones\r\nof young animals, and especially certain bones, contain a larger\r\nproportion of cartilage than the hollow bones which produce the best\r\n”char”. In making bone black to be used as a pigment just those bones\r\nshould be chosen which are of less value for ”char”.\r\n\r\nOn the small scale, bone black can be made by carbonising in crucibles;\r\nthese hold about 16 kilogrammes of bones, they have a projecting rim,\r\nso that when one is placed upon the other it serves as a lid for the\r\nfirst. Piles of these pots are formed, the top one being covered by a\r\nwell-fitting lid. The piles are heated in a furnace in such a manner\r\nthat the flames can freely circulate between them. At first a small\r\nfire is applied; as soon as dry distillation of the bones begins, which\r\nis recognised by pale white flames at the rims of the crucibles, the\r\nfire is damped, because the burning products of distillation produce so\r\nmuch heat that the crucibles are soon at a good red heat.\r\n\r\nWhen the flames disappear the fire is maintained for about fifteen\r\nminutes longer, and when the crucibles have cooled to some extent\r\nthey are taken out of the furnace and immediately emptied into a\r\nsheet-iron cylinder, in which the charcoal remains until quite cold.\r\nIf the black comes in contact with air whilst still hot a portion of\r\nthe carbon burns and the product has little value either as a pigment\r\nor for decolourising purposes. When quite cold the black is ground and\r\nlevigated. The bone ash it contains makes these operations easy. Bone\r\nblack contains at the most 12 to 13 per cent. of carbon; the remainder\r\nconsists of bone ash and water absorbed by the hygroscopic carbon from\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\nBone black which has been partially burnt in the process has a greyish\r\ntinge; it may also have an ugly shade of brown: this is the case when\r\nit has not been heated to a sufficiently high temperature, so that\r\nit still contains some quantity of organic matter. Such black can be\r\nmade usable by again heating, but it would always be desirable to test\r\na small portion before the whole was ground and levigated; a uniform\r\nheating of the finely-powdered black would be attended with difficulty.\r\n\r\nFinely ground bone black has numerous uses as a pigment; by a simple\r\nprocess it can be converted into almost pure carbon, which can be used\r\nas an excellent black pigment for all purposes for which blacks are\r\nemployed. Bone black consists of bone ash upon which fine particles\r\nof carbon are deposited. Bone ash is easily soluble in hydrochloric\r\nacid; if finely ground bone black is treated with this acid and the\r\nresidue washed with water until the washings are neutral, a residue\r\nof extremely soft and pure carbon is obtained, which has a deep black\r\ncolour and, in consequence of its fine division, very great covering\r\npower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURE OF SOOT PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soot which is formed in the incomplete combustion of organic\r\nsubstances containing a large proportion of carbon is a mixture of\r\ndifferent substances, of which carbon is the chief; in addition to\r\nthis, we find in soot almost all the products which result by the\r\ndry distillation of the substance from which it is formed. Soot from\r\nhard wood contains different compounds to soot from soft wood; again,\r\nrosin soot is of a different nature to that obtained in the incomplete\r\ncombustion of fats. We can thus define soot as very finely divided\r\ncarbon, mixed with the products of dry distillation.\r\n\r\nThe soot of hard woods, which contain little or no resin, has a deep\r\nblack, though dull hue; it is a gritty powder, and has little value as\r\na pigment. Wood containing much resin, such as the wood of the pine,\r\nrosin, fish oil, asphaltum, in short, all bodies which are at the same\r\ntime easily combustible and rich in carbon, produce on the contrary a\r\nhandsome, glistening soot, which forms a valuable pigment.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this difference in composition, soot from different\r\nsources differs also in the size of its particles. Soot forms light\r\nflocks, which adhere to projections in the flues through which the\r\nproducts of combustion pass; the larger the flocks the sooner they are\r\ndeposited, the smaller they are the longer they remain suspended. The\r\nfinest particles of soot are called ”flying soot,” which is very highly\r\nprized on account of its fine division.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of soot blacks is a very important industry: black\r\nprinting ink, which is used in such enormous quantities, is made from a\r\nsoot black; in addition, all the best black paints and lacquers. Soot\r\nblack was formerly made in the most primitive manner, and is still, to\r\nsome extent, as will be seen from the account of the manufacture of\r\nrosin black. The process used for printing blacks is more rational, but\r\nis still capable of great improvements. The principles of a rational\r\nmanufacture of soot blacks will be briefly indicated.\r\n\r\n=The Manufacture of Soot Blacks on the Large Scale.=—The principle\r\nof the arrangements necessary for making soot blacks is very simple.\r\nAn apparatus is required in which substances very rich in carbon can\r\nbe burnt at the lowest possible temperature; this apparatus must be\r\nconnected with suitable arrangements for retaining the soot carried\r\naway with the products of combustion. The soot works as at present\r\narranged are developments of the crude arrangements still used in\r\ndistricts in which there is an abundant supply of pine wood containing\r\nmuch resin. The apparatus used in such localities consists of a low\r\nmasonry flue connected with a long pipe built of wooden boards. In\r\norder to give this pipe a rough surface upon which the soot can\r\nreadily deposit, it is lined in several places with coarse linen, to\r\nthe projecting fibres of which the soot adheres. In the flue the very\r\nresiniferous wood is burnt, especially the roots of pines, which are\r\nvery rich in resin; these burn with an unrestricted air supply with a\r\nbright flame, but when the air is restricted, they give off a large\r\nquantity of a very heavy smoke. The operation is commenced by first\r\nmaking a good fire of dry split wood, the object of which is to heat\r\nthe flue and thus prevent the deposition of soot in it in the later\r\npart of the process. If a deposit of soot formed in the flue it might\r\ntake fire, the fire would then spread further into the wooden flue and\r\na considerable loss of soot would occur. When the stonework has become\r\nso hot that deposition of soot in it is no longer to be feared, the\r\nmaterials are introduced from which the soot is to be made. As has been\r\nsaid, pine roots are generally used, the chips of pine wood are also\r\nused in some districts, and in general such combustible materials as\r\nproduce a large quantity of smoke.\r\n\r\nThe combustion in the flue must be conducted with care, it should\r\nproceed at the lowest possible temperature, but this should not sink\r\nbelow a certain minimum. If the fire is too strong the greater portion\r\nof the carbon is burnt, which would otherwise be obtained as soot; the\r\nyield of soot is very small, and generally only ”dust soot” would be\r\nobtained, without any quantity of ”flying soot”. On the other hand, if\r\ntoo little air enters, so that the combustion takes place at too low\r\na temperature, a large yield of soot is obtained, but it is of poor\r\nquality. Soot obtained by combustion at too low temperatures has not a\r\npure black but a perceptibly brown colour; it has not the flocculent\r\nnature of the best product, a small weight of which occupies a very\r\nlarge volume, but is greasy and has a high specific gravity. The\r\nlower the temperature used in producing soot black, the further is\r\nthe chemical change removed from that of ordinary combustion, and the\r\nnearer to that of dry distillation. Soot produced with an insufficient\r\nsupply of air contains a considerable quantity of liquid and solid\r\nproducts of dry distillation, which give it a brown colour and the\r\nabove-mentioned greasy nature.\r\n\r\nIn many soot works the air supply is regulated in a most primitive\r\nmanner: the workman places against the openings by which air is\r\nadmitted to the burning materials a larger or smaller number of bricks\r\naccording as the combustion appears to be too rapid or too slow.\r\nUnfortunately there is no clear sign to indicate the temperature most\r\nfavourable for the production of the greatest quantity of soot, the\r\nappearance of the flame alone can be taken as a guide. If the flame\r\nappears pure white and very luminous and shows at its end no thick\r\nblack smoke the combustion is very complete, and but a very small yield\r\nof soot is to be expected. On the other hand, if the flame continually\r\nthreatens to go out the air supply is too small and a liberal amount of\r\nsoot will be formed, but mixed with a large quantity of the products\r\nof dry distillation. As far as it can be described in words the flame\r\nshould appear as follows: The colour should be a murky red, similar to\r\nthat of the flame of a bad tallow candle; in shape the flame should be\r\na long drawn out tongue, from the point of which a thick black smoke is\r\nclearly seen. The soot deposits in the long board flues in the form of\r\nflocks or dust. The properties of the soot which is deposited in the\r\ndifferent parts of the long flue vary according to the distance from\r\nthe place of combustion, near to which a good black soot is deposited,\r\nrequiring, however, long grinding with oil or gum solution to form a\r\ngood paint. At a greater distance the soft and very fine ”flying soot”\r\nis deposited; it is the most pure black and is regarded as the best\r\nquality. The soot deposited farther on is more and more brown, and\r\nhas a more greasy nature the greater the distance from the place of\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\nThe flue for the reception of the soot must be made so long that hardly\r\nany smoke is perceptible at the end, which it is convenient to connect\r\nwith a chimney with a good draught, regulated by a damper. In this case\r\nthe combustion and the speed at which the products enter the flues are\r\ntwice regulated.\r\n\r\nThe material of which the flues are constructed through which the\r\nproducts of combustion are led influences the manner in which the soot\r\nis deposited; the portions nearest to the grate must be of stonework,\r\nbut when the smoke has cooled to a certain extent different materials\r\ncan be used in addition to wood; flues made of sacking stretched over\r\nlaths are used. The fine flying soot adheres to the roughnesses of the\r\ncoarse sacking, and is easily loosened by striking the wall of the flue.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, the arrangements of most soot works are very\r\nprimitive; they obtain only a fraction of the quantity of soot which\r\nthey could produce by a proper regulation of the draught in the\r\ncombustion chamber and in the flue in which the soot deposits. We\r\nshall now briefly describe the conditions which should be regarded in\r\nconstructing a soot works; these conditions have not been found to be\r\nobserved in any works we have seen, in this branch of chemical industry\r\nso-called practical experience is alone regarded, and consequently the\r\n”practical” soot burner loses large sums, literally up the chimney. A\r\nblack works can be properly designed by any one who knows sufficient\r\nchemistry to understand the process of combustion. Of this most\r\neducated men have some understanding, but the practical soot burner\r\nappears to have but hazy ideas on the subject, for one occasionally\r\nfinds the arrangements for making soot in direct opposition to the\r\nproper disposition.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of the uniformity of the product and of safety against\r\nfire, the flues in which the soot is deposited should be entirely of\r\nmasonry; the joints of the bricks should be smoothly cemented over,\r\nso that soot cannot collect in quantity in them. The end of this flue\r\nshould be connected with a high chimney provided at the top with a\r\nwell-fitting damper, so that the draught in flues and chimney can be\r\nregulated at will or completely stopped. Such an arrangement, perhaps\r\nsomewhat costly, has many important advantages: it is fire-proof,\r\nand when once warm remains so for a long time, since bricks are bad\r\nconductors of heat. When the flue is hot no water condenses in it; all\r\nthe water formed in the combustion remains in the form of vapour, and\r\nis carried away by the chimney. A further advantage is that it is not\r\noften necessary to enter the flue to collect the soot; burning may be\r\ncontinued for a long time, and a large quantity of soot taken at once\r\nfrom the flues or soot chambers.\r\n\r\nThe soot collects on the walls of the chambers in flocks, which finally\r\nbecome so heavy that they fall off and collect on the floor. The entry\r\nto the soot chambers should be through a single iron door, tightly\r\nclosed whilst the chambers are in use, and cemented round. If this door\r\ndoes not fit air-tight the combustion cannot be exactly regulated by\r\nthe damper on the chimney. The soot is removed from the chambers by a\r\nworkman, who sweeps off with a soft brush into a sheet-iron vessel the\r\nsoot adhering to the walls and lying on the ground. It is extremely\r\nimportant that soot and nothing else should be collected; the brush\r\nused for loosening the soot should be so soft that it does not rub off\r\nmortar from the brickwork; the workman’s shoes should be provided with\r\nfelt soles, so that no particles are loosened from the floor of the\r\nchamber and mixed with the soot. The admixture of the smallest quantity\r\nof sand would be extremely harmful in the ensuing grinding of the soot;\r\nthe mills would be damaged.\r\n\r\nThe flues for collecting the soot in well arranged works are very\r\nsimilar, but the apparatus used for burning the materials which produce\r\nthe soot varies greatly according to the nature of the material. Some\r\nquantity of the soot black used in the arts is still made by burning\r\npine roots and chips, but for the finer qualities American rosin\r\nis largely employed. Earth-wax or ozokerite and the hydrocarbons\r\nobtained from petroleum and in the distillation of shale are materials\r\nfrequently used in making soot blacks of very good quality. For\r\nthe finest qualities, such as are used for fine printing inks,\r\ncopper-plate inks and black lacquers, soot obtained by burning fish\r\noils or cheap fatty oils is most commonly used. The great differences\r\nin the physical nature of these materials demand the use of different\r\napparatus for their combustion. The space allotted to soot blacks in\r\nthis work would be far exceeded if the construction of all the forms of\r\napparatus were described; the most important only will be given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\nWhen rosin is the raw material, the combustion can be conducted in flat\r\nspoon-shaped vessels placed before a narrow opening into the flue. Fig.\r\n30 shows an arrangement very successful in practice. The spoon-shaped\r\niron vessel, G, stands in a second, G₁, which is filled with water:\r\nthis prevents the fused rosin from becoming too hot. If the temperature\r\nin G rose too high, dry distillation would take place along with the\r\ncombustion of the rosin, and the soot would be largely contaminated\r\nby the products of this distillation. This may proceed so far that in\r\nplace of the fine flocks of soot a greasy mass is deposited in the\r\nflues, consisting of a mixture of soot with products of distillation,\r\nfrom which the soot could be obtained only with great difficulty. The\r\nsoot and gaseous products of combustion pass through the opening, O,\r\ninto the flues, R R. This opening is only several centimetres wide,\r\nbut is nearly as long as the combustion vessel. Above the vessel,\r\nG, is a movable iron cover, D, in which are slides by which the air\r\nsupply is regulated. The cover is only taken off when fresh material is\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nThe air supply cannot be sufficiently regulated by the slides in the\r\ncover; these must be used in conjunction with the chimney damper. The\r\ncombustion is observed through a thick glass plate let into the cover.\r\nAt the commencement of the operation slides and damper are completely\r\nopened. When the chimney is seen to emit a thick black smoke the flues\r\nare filled with the products of combustion, and the speed with which\r\nthey pass through the flues must be regulated. The current of air is\r\ndecreased until only a little visible smoke escapes from the chimney,\r\nand the flame is no longer white, but a murky red. It should be noted\r\nthat the first soot obtained from a new works is never of the best\r\nquality, the production of this is only gradually attained. The cause\r\nof this is that the new masonry is damp and gives up water to the hot\r\ngases, so that they are cooled and their velocity disturbed; the soot\r\nwill also be damp. Thus a greasy soot is obtained. It is of very little\r\nuse to allow the installation to remain unused for some months after it\r\nis completed; the brickwork would only dry superficially, and when it\r\nwas first heated the presence of the water would become evident.\r\n\r\nIn order to dry the whole erection to such an extent that the moisture\r\nfrom the brickwork has no effect on the regular course of the\r\noperation, it is advisable to commence with materials of little value\r\nand to allow a portion of them to be lost by the use of a stronger\r\ndraught than is generally used, so that the flues can be freed from\r\nall moisture as soon as possible. This applies equally to all kinds of\r\narrangements for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\nLamps are used to burn liquid fats and mineral oils. These lamps\r\nnaturally have a different construction to those used for lighting,\r\nwhich are constructed with the object of burning all the carbon in\r\nthe oil, so that the temperature may rise as high as possible and the\r\ncarbon burn at a high white heat. The lamps used in the soot black\r\nmanufacture are designed to burn only as much carbon as is absolutely\r\nnecessary to maintain the flame, at the same time the temperature of\r\nthe flame must be kept low, so that no portion of the soot is again\r\nburnt. These lamps have flat burners and are enclosed in a sheet-iron\r\ncasing provided with an air regulator, which must work very accurately,\r\notherwise air will enter between the joints and the working of the\r\nregulator will be deceptive. So that the material to be burnt shall\r\nnot be too strongly heated, which would be accompanied by great loss\r\nwhen mineral oil is used, the reservoir should be placed outside the\r\niron casing which surrounds the burner.\r\n\r\nFig. 31 shows the construction of a soot lamp. The flat burner, B,\r\nis placed in the cylindrical sheet-iron mantle, H, which is bent\r\nabove at not too sharp an angle. The products of combustion are led\r\ninto a chamber, K, from which they pass into the flues where the\r\nsoot is deposited. The form of the upper portion of the cylinder is\r\nof importance; if this is bent at right angles, soot accumulates on\r\nthe angle, and when a mass has formed it falls off, and is partly\r\nburned in the flame. If the cylinder is given a proper bend no soot is\r\ndeposited in it, but it is all carried away into the soot chambers.\r\nThe air regulator, S, is placed at the bottom of the cylinder; it must\r\nturn easily. The larger the slits are made by the rotation of this\r\nregulator, the more oxygen enters the flame, and the more vigorous\r\nis the combustion. A small, well-fitting door is placed in the lower\r\npart of the cylinder, through which the wick can be reached; opposite\r\nto this a glass plate is inserted, so that the flame may be observed\r\nwithout opening the door. The wick is raised or lowered by means of the\r\nscrew, R.\r\n\r\nThe oil reservoir, O, must be outside the cylinder: in the older\r\narrangements it is so placed that the wick sucks up the oil; the\r\nworkman who is in charge of the lamps must then take particular care\r\nthat the reservoirs always contain the proper quantity of oil, if he\r\nneglects to keep the oil at the proper level the wick is charred; it\r\nthen sucks up too much oil, which cannot completely burn and is chiefly\r\ndistilled, so that the soot is oily and cannot easily be treated\r\nafterwards. The most diligent and attentive workman who is in charge\r\nof a large number of lamps may easily allow one of them to run short\r\nof oil. With the oil reservoir above depicted, a new quantity of oil\r\nflows only when the level of the liquid sinks below the line, U. As\r\nsoon as a small quantity is used air enters the reservoir, O, in place\r\nof which oil runs out until the opening, U, is again closed by the\r\nliquid. This construction of lamp only works well when thin oils are\r\nburned, and great care must be taken that the lamps are kept constantly\r\nclean.\r\n\r\nLamps of all constructions have some drawbacks, they must always be\r\ncleaned, and losses of oil occur in filling. These defects are obviated\r\nwhen, instead of providing each lamp with its own reservoir, a single\r\none is used for a large number of lamps, which are automatically fed\r\nfrom it. In this case the attendant has only to regulate the air supply\r\nto the lamps, and to see that the mechanical arrangement by which the\r\noil flows to the different lamps is working properly. When the lamps\r\nare automatically fed, the burners must be firmly fixed, and all in\r\nthe same horizontal plane. A pipe connects each burner with a main\r\npipe running under the lamps, which latter pipe is connected with the\r\nreservoir, and this in its turn is connected with another reservoir\r\nplaced a little higher. In the pipe connecting the two reservoirs is\r\na tap, which is opened by a float in the lower vessel as soon as the\r\nlevel of the liquid in it sinks a little, and which remains open until\r\nthe level of the liquid has again risen to a certain height. The float\r\nin the reservoir connected with the lamps is arranged so that the level\r\nof the liquid is slightly higher than the burners. Under the slight\r\npressure oil continually flows to the burners, and it is not difficult\r\nto regulate its flow so that all which reaches the burner is burned.\r\n\r\nIn using a new oil it is not easy at first to regulate the flow so\r\nthat absolutely all is burned without any dropping off the burner; to\r\nprevent the loss of this portion, the lower end of the air regulator\r\nis conical, at the apex of the cone is a small tube and under this\r\na vessel in which the unburnt oil is caught. In Fig. 32, S is the\r\nair regulator, T the vessel to catch the unburnt oil, L the pipe\r\nleading from each burner to the common pipe H, G the vessel in which a\r\nfloat regulates the flow from a larger reservoir, so that the liquid\r\nalways remains at the same level. When tar oils are used, or thin\r\nmineral oils, the pipes which convey the oil to the burners may be\r\nmade tolerably narrow, but when viscous oils or fish oils are burned,\r\nnarrow tubes would offer too great resistance to the flow, so that\r\nit is always advisable to use fairly wide pipes. Viscous oils become\r\nconsiderably more fluid at higher temperatures, it is therefore well\r\nto place the reservoirs in the same room as the lamps; in winter the\r\ntemperature of this room is kept fairly high by the burning of the\r\nlamps, and thus the oils remain fluid.\r\n\r\nFIG. 32.\r\n\r\nIn recent years hydrocarbons of very low boiling point have been\r\nplaced on the market at low prices; these produce a black of very good\r\nquality. On account of the low boiling point of these very inflammable\r\nliquids, particular care is necessary in burning them; they are very\r\nfluid and retain their fluidity at a low temperature. The reservoirs\r\nfor them should be placed for safety outside the lamp room, and\r\nshould be closed by an air-tight lid, with only one small opening\r\nthrough which air can enter. When these low boiling liquids are used,\r\nparticular care must be taken to regulate the flow to the lamp, or\r\nlarge quantities will evaporate without being burnt.\r\n\r\nThe materials used in the manufacture of soot black differ considerably\r\nin chemical constitution. Rosin, animal and vegetable fats, distilled\r\noils and volatile hydrocarbons are used. Each of these substances gives\r\ndifferent decomposition products when heated, to which proper regard\r\nmust be had, since the quality of the black is dependent on them. The\r\nmore difficultly volatile are the products of distillation, the higher\r\nmust be the temperature at which the combustion is conducted, otherwise\r\nthe soot will contain a considerable quantity of these products of\r\ndistillation. In consideration of the great variety of materials used\r\nfor making soot black, it is impossible to say exactly in what manner\r\neach should be treated: this must be left to the practical experience\r\nof the manufacturer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURE OF LAMP BLACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe variety of soot black known as lamp black is the best; it is used\r\nfor making copper-plate inks and black coach paints. Its price is\r\nmuch higher than that of ordinary soot black; for the best qualities,\r\ntwenty times the price of an ordinary black is paid. The materials\r\nalready mentioned are used for making lamp black, fish oils and rancid\r\nvegetable oils, and in recent times mineral oil and tar oils. In regard\r\nto vegetable oils it is to be observed that it is advisable to use\r\nvery rancid oil, which gives a larger yield of soot; experience has\r\nshown that a very rancid oil requires a larger quantity of oxygen to\r\nburn without a smoky flame than a sweet oil. This indicates that a\r\nportion of the carbon in the rancid oil is present in such a form that\r\nit requires a higher temperature to burn it than is required for the\r\ncarbon in sweet oils. The use of rancid oils for making soot blacks has\r\nthus two advantages, it is much cheaper and produces a larger yield.\r\nThe only disadvantage, and not a very important one, attending the\r\nuse of rancid oil is that the free fatty acids in these oils strongly\r\nattack the metallic parts of the lamps. This is especially the case\r\nwith copper and brass; only such portions of the lamps as is absolutely\r\nnecessary should be made of these metals; all other parts, and in\r\nparticular the oil reservoirs, should be made of tin plate.\r\n\r\nSince the development of the coal-tar industry oils distilled from\r\ncoal tar have come into commerce at low prices. These oils consist of\r\ncarbon and hydrogen and are equally volatile with the essential oils,\r\nto which class turpentine belongs. There are two kinds of these tar\r\noils, light and heavy; they differ both in specific gravity and in\r\nthe boiling temperature, which ranges between tolerably wide limits.\r\nWhen the burning qualities of these oils are examined, they show a\r\ngreat difference in the quantities of oxygen necessary for complete\r\ncombustion with a white flame without smoke. The more oxygen an oil\r\nrequires to burn with a non-smoky flame, the more suited it is for the\r\nmanufacture of blacks. Generally speaking, the difficulty of completely\r\nburning these oils is in proportion to their specific gravity and the\r\nheight of their boiling point.\r\n\r\nBy the distillation of rosin, oils are obtained which also consist of\r\ncarbon and hydrogen and form a useful material for the manufacture of\r\nsoot blacks. The mineral known as earth-wax or ozokerite, a substance\r\nintermediate between asphaltum and petroleum, can also be used, but\r\nsince it is a solid it must be burnt in troughs.\r\n\r\nIn burning light oils the arrangements can be very simply made; wicks\r\nare not required and thus a considerable outlay is spared. In place\r\nof the burner, shallow dishes are used into which the oil enters from\r\nbelow, replacing that burnt away. It is necessary to cool these dishes\r\ncontinuously from below, otherwise they would soon become so hot that\r\nthe greater part of the oil would evaporate without burning, and it\r\nwould also be very difficult to regulate the flame properly.\r\n\r\nBlack can be obtained from very resiniferous coal by burning in\r\nfurnaces with a regulated air supply. The product is, however,\r\ngenerally largely contaminated by ash, and can only be used for common\r\npurposes. Very resiniferous lignite gives a better product than coal;\r\nthe black can be partially separated from the ashes by shaking upon\r\nwater and then stirring, when the particles of ash sink to the bottom\r\nand the light black floats on the top.\r\n\r\nHowever carefully the manufacture of soot black is conducted, it\r\nwill always contain, in addition to carbon, varying quantities of\r\nthe products of distillation, partly solid and partly liquid. In\r\nconsequence of these admixtures the soot will not be pure black, but\r\nwill show a more or less brown tinge, which is clearly observed when\r\nthe black is smeared on white paper. At a certain thickness of the\r\nlayer of soot it will be seen that the colour is not black, but an\r\nimpure brown. When such soot, as it is taken from the chambers, is\r\nchemically examined, it is found that it gives up a large quantity of\r\nsoluble matter to different chemical reagents. By proper treatment\r\nit is possible to remove the admixtures almost completely, so that\r\nnearly chemically pure carbon remains. Such pure carbon can be made by\r\nboiling lamp black with strong caustic soda solution so long as the\r\nliquid is coloured, and when caustic soda can dissolve nothing more,\r\nthe residue is boiled with _aqua regia_ until this no longer takes\r\nup soluble matter. The black is then washed with water until free\r\nfrom every trace of acid, and the residue dried. By this treatment\r\nthe soot is converted into a powder of the purest black hue which it\r\nis possible to obtain. It is now no longer soot, but chemically pure\r\ncarbon in the non-crystalline form; heated upon platinum foil it burns\r\nto pure carbonic acid without producing smoke or smell. In practice\r\nthe purification of the soot is not carried to the extent of producing\r\npure carbon; this would be accompanied by a diminished yield of the\r\npigment without increasing the commercial value of the product: the aim\r\nof the manufacturer is simply to produce a substance of a pure black\r\nappearance from the brown soot. To remove the brown substances present\r\nin the crude soot the solvent action of caustic soda solution can be\r\nused. The soot is several times boiled in iron pans with strong caustic\r\nsoda solution in order to dissolve the products of dry distillation.\r\nIt is superfluous to repeat this operation until fresh caustic soda\r\nremains colourless. The treatment may be stopped when the solution\r\nacquires a slight brownish colour. When the soot has been purified so\r\nfar it has lost its brown shade and now appears as a velvety black\r\npowder, very soft and very light, and distinguished by extraordinary\r\ncovering power.\r\n\r\nIt is not so easy as it appears at first sight to judge of the quality\r\nof a black pigment by its appearance. To the unaccustomed eye a pigment\r\nmay appear to be of an unexceptionable black, which to the expert\r\nappears decidedly brown; only long practice can give the eye the\r\nrequisite keenness. In addition to the test already given—of smearing\r\non white paper—there is another especially to be recommended to the\r\ninexperienced for discriminating between pigments. A small quantity of\r\nthe black under examination is intimately mixed with a white pigment;\r\nwhite lead or zinc white is very suitable. If the mixture has a pure\r\ngrey shade, the black may be regarded as of good quality, but if it\r\ncontains brown substances the mixture has an indefinite, dirty shade\r\ninstead of a pure grey. This is a sure sign that the black requires\r\nfurther purification.\r\n\r\nAlthough caustic soda is now very cheap, its use for the purification\r\nof soot black is tolerably costly, because it entails much labour. This\r\nprocess is therefore only used for the finest qualities which are to be\r\nemployed for copper-plate inks and black coach colours. For inferior\r\nqualities the method of calcination is used, which produces, when\r\nproperly carried out, a black of such purity that it can be used for\r\nthe preparation of even the finest black paints.\r\n\r\n_Calcination of the Soot._—The substances which give the soot its brown\r\ncolour are products of dry distillation, and hence are all volatile at\r\na certain temperature; they can be separated from the soot by heating\r\nit in the absence of air. The temperature necessary completely to\r\nvolatilise these compounds is fairly high. The soot must be heated to a\r\ngood red heat to obtain a safe result.\r\n\r\nWhen the soot is heated too quickly or to too high a temperature it\r\nundergoes an alteration which affects the quality of the product.\r\nBy too long or too vigorous ignition the soot changes its flocky\r\nconsistency to a sandy nature; it will then require much longer\r\ngrinding with oil to produce a uniform mixture than is the case with\r\nthe light flocculent soot, which very readily mixes with oil.\r\n\r\nThe soot is ignited in sheet-iron boxes with a coating to protect the\r\nmetal from burning. This coating is best made from clay and hair. A\r\nvery thin paste of clay and water is painted uniformly over the boxes\r\nwith a brush; when the first coat is dry a second and third are given.\r\nWhen once the metal is completely covered with clay, several coats\r\nare given of clay mixed with chopped tow until the layer is several\r\nmillimetres thick. The coating carefully made in this manner is very\r\ndurable, and the boxes can be used for a long time, whilst without\r\nthe coating they would very soon be burnt. Particular care must be\r\ngiven to the manufacture of the boxes themselves; the bottoms must fit\r\nvery accurately, and should be coated with clay in order to ensure an\r\nair-tight joint. The lids also must fit accurately, and when they are\r\nclosed must equally be made tight by clay.\r\n\r\nThe soot is at first loosely packed into the box and each portion then\r\npressed with a rammer so that it tightly fills the boxes. In the lid is\r\na very small opening, through which the volatile products can escape.\r\nThe heating begins quite gently at the back, and proceeds gradually to\r\nthe front; the boxes are finally brought to a good red heat, at which\r\nthey are maintained for about half an hour; at this temperature the\r\nsubstances mixed with the carbon are almost entirely volatilised, and\r\nthe soot acquires its true black appearance. The soot itself attains\r\na red heat in the boxes and in consequence of its loose nature it\r\nvery readily burns. The precautions given above must be observed in\r\norder to protect completely the soot against the action of the air. The\r\nboxes should not have the smallest opening besides that in the cover\r\nnecessary for the escape of the volatile matters; through an opening\r\ninvisible to the naked eye so much oxygen may enter during the cooling\r\nof the boxes that a considerable quantity of carbon will burn to\r\ncarbonic acid.\r\n\r\nTo avoid losses through the carbon burning precautions must equally be\r\ntaken in the cooling of the boxes. When the ignition is finished they\r\nare drawn out of the furnace by tongs and placed upright on a stone\r\nfloor; as the cool air enters, and in contact with the red-hot carbon\r\nwould burn a portion of it. This can be prevented by a simple artifice:\r\na red-hot coal is placed on the small opening in the lid; this converts\r\nthe oxygen of the air which enters the boxes into carbonic acid. When\r\nall the boxes are taken out of the furnace the doors of the room in\r\nwhich they are placed are opened, so that they are cooled in the\r\ndraught. Finely divided carbon takes fire at a temperature far below a\r\nred heat, so that the boxes should not be opened until their contents\r\nare quite cold. If they were opened whilst hot the soot might take fire.\r\n\r\n=Pine Black.=—Under this name a poor quality of black comes into the\r\nmarket, which is much used for ordinary black paints, etc. The pine\r\nblack formerly brought into the market was what its name purported; it\r\nwas made from the roots of the pine in the primitive fashion already\r\ndescribed. The black was sold without further purification: it was a\r\nsoft light powder, very variable in shade on account of the absence of\r\ncontrol over the process: it varied from pure black to a dark brown.\r\nAt present, under the name of pine black many substances are sold,\r\ngenerally without purification, made from the most different materials,\r\nfrequently from rosin, rosin residues, and other cheap materials.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF SOOT BLACK WITHOUT CHAMBERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA certain temperature is necessary for the combustion of every\r\nsubstance; if a cold body is placed in the flame of a candle or an\r\noil lamp it becomes covered with soot, because it cools the flame to\r\nsuch an extent that the carbon is no longer heated to the temperature\r\nnecessary for its combustion, and is, therefore, separated in a finely\r\ndivided condition. Use is made of this phenomenon in a method of making\r\nsoot black which has many advantages, of which the most important is\r\nthat expensive buildings are not required, and the manufacture can be\r\nconducted in restricted space.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.]\r\n\r\nA convenient arrangement for obtaining black by this process is\r\nrepresented in Fig. 33. The thin-walled hollow cast-iron cylinder is\r\nturned smooth on the outer surface, and is surrounded by a sheet-iron\r\ncover at the distance of a few centimetres; it rotates in bearings,\r\nwhich, like the spindles, are hollow; cold water is thus led through\r\nthe cylinder from a tank at a higher level. Below the cylinder are\r\nplaced, near to one another, smoking lamps, and at the side of the\r\ncylinder is a broad brush of soft hair which continuously removes the\r\nsoot deposited on the surface, which then falls over an inclined plate\r\ninto the collecting vessel. The cylinder is kept in slow rotation by\r\nany mechanical arrangement. The lamps are devised not to produce a\r\nhot flame, but when this comes in contact with the cold surface of\r\nthe cylinder, it deposits a ring of soot on the rotating cylinder\r\nwhich is then removed by the brush. The cylinder is kept cooled by\r\nthe water which runs through it. The soot which is collected shows a\r\ntolerably strong brown shade in consequence of the rapid cooling of the\r\nflame, which causes the formation of a large quantity of products of\r\ndistillation; the soot will always require ignition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.]\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed further to simplify the manufacture of soot black\r\nby this method, by burning coal gas under the cylinder from numerous\r\nsmall openings in a pipe. Coal gas indeed gives a very fine deep black,\r\nbut the yield is so small that this process could never be adopted with\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus constructed by Thalwitzer for the manufacture of oil\r\nblack (Fig. 34) consists of a plate, _A_, with a rim, _a_, fastened to\r\na vertical axis, _b_. This is carried by bearings in _B_, and is kept\r\nin rotation by the cog-wheels, _d_ and _f_, moved from the shafting,\r\n_O_. The plate is cooled by water supplied by the pipe, _g_, it flows\r\naway by _h_ and the annular vessel, _D_.

It is generally believed that Indian ink\r\nis made in China by a process which is still a secret; this opinion\r\nis supported by the fact that the ink made in Europe is almost always\r\ninferior to the Chinese. It is quite possible that a substance which\r\nproduces a particularly fine black is used in China to prepare the soot\r\nused for the ink, and which we do not yet know or do not use on account\r\nof its high price. But it appears that the difficulty of producing an\r\nink equal in quality to the Chinese lies less in the quality of the\r\nsoot —for by the methods of purification already given we can make\r\nalmost chemically pure carbon—than in the extremely careful mechanical\r\ntreatment of the soot with the other constituents of the ink.\r\n\r\nThe genuine Chinese ink has a peculiar smell, which, when not hidden\r\nby musk, distinctly recalls the smell of burning camphor; the camphor\r\ntree is a native of China, so that it is not impossible that the soot\r\nof the wood of this tree is used for the ink. The soot from camphor\r\nalone would be too expensive, so that it is probable that camphor wood\r\nis used from which camphor has been prepared, or that camphor soot is\r\nmixed with the soot of a cheaper substance. In fact several varieties\r\nof Chinese ink show distinctly the smell peculiar to soot produced by\r\nfat. The binding material is animal glue, which is most thoroughly\r\nground with the carbon; the secret of making good Indian ink lies in\r\nthe careful grinding with the binding medium.\r\n\r\nAccording to Piou, who lived for a long time in China and learned the\r\nprocess there used, the black employed for the ink is made from the\r\nresins of the pine and other trees. The soot is sieved through silk,\r\nboiled with glue and water, and kneaded by hand with a little oil until\r\nthe mass has become completely homogeneous. It is then left for some\r\ndays, heated, and pressed into the moulds. This description is not very\r\nsatisfactory; the products obtained are far inferior to those made by\r\nthe ordinary European process.\r\n\r\nThe viscous mass obtained by long treatment of the black with the\r\nbinding medium is slowly dried, and again ground when it has become\r\nthick. When a completely homogeneous paste has been obtained it is\r\nmade into sticks which are pressed into moulds, and then very slowly\r\ndried so that they do not crack. Small cracks always occur; they are\r\nfilled in by a brush dipped in the thick paste, finally the sticks are\r\nentirely or partially covered with gold leaf.\r\n\r\nIn order to impart to the ink the odour characteristic of the Chinese\r\nink, it is sufficient to use good lamp black, made odourless by\r\nextraction with caustic soda, and to add a little solution of camphor\r\nin turpentine during the grinding. If it is desired to impart the musk\r\nsmell which several Chinese varieties possess, a small quantity of a\r\nspirit extract of genuine musk may be added.\r\n\r\nThe size solution is made by long boiling isinglass with water; it\r\nmust be so concentrated that it forms a strong jelly on cooling. A\r\nsmall quantity of acetic acid is added, so that the grinding may not\r\nbe hindered by the viscous nature of the size, which the acid prevents\r\nfrom gelatinising. When the mixture has been made by long grinding,\r\nthe mortar is warmed to 40° or 50° C., whereupon the acetic acid is\r\nsoon volatilised, and the mass rapidly becomes very thick.\r\n\r\n=Neutral Tint Black.=—A mixture of Indian ink, Chinese blue, and a very\r\nsmall quantity of madder lake forms the colour known as ”neutral tint,”\r\nthe shade of which is a peculiar greyish violet. By alterations in the\r\nproportions of the constituents different shades of ”neutral tint” are\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.—BLACK MINERAL PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Chrome Copper Black.=—When copper chromate is strongly ignited in air\r\nand then treated with boiling nitric acid a glittering black compound\r\nis obtained, which shows up well when printed on fabrics with albumin.\r\nThis and all similar pigments are distinguished by great durability.\r\n\r\n=Chrome Black.=—When a mixture of chromium oxide with varying\r\nquantities of ferric oxide is strongly heated, pigments are obtained\r\nof all shades from dirty yellow and green to the deepest black. This\r\npigment is largely used in porcelain painting to produce a black, which\r\nalso can be obtained by other but much more costly methods. The best\r\nmixture to produce a deep black contains one part of chromium oxide to\r\nfour parts of ferric oxide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nENAMEL COLOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn enamel is a glass distinguished from ordinary glazes by a much lower\r\nmelting point, and generally by opacity. Most enamels are coloured by\r\nadditions of metallic oxides.\r\n\r\nWithout going in detail into the art of enamelling, some observations\r\nmay here be given which appear indispensable for an understanding of\r\nthe manufacture of enamel colours. The enamels are glasses, but not\r\nevery glass can be used for an enamel, since the constituents of the\r\nglass react with the substances by which the enamel is coloured, and\r\nwith certain colouring matters quite different shades to the intended\r\nmight be produced. Of equal importance with the composition of the\r\nglass used in the preparation of the enamel is the temperature at which\r\nthe glass melts. Many colours bear but a low heat; they decompose at a\r\nsomewhat higher temperature and produce quite the wrong colour. This is\r\nespecially the case with the enamels coloured purple red by gold.\r\n\r\nThe enamel colours are fixed by mixing them with an easily fusible\r\nglass (the flux), applying them to the object to be enamelled, whether\r\nmetal, glass, or porcelain, and heating the painted article in muffles\r\nuntil the glass melts, and either dissolves the colouring matter or\r\nencloses it unaltered. According as the enamel melts as a whole, or the\r\nflux alone melts and encloses the colouring matter, so transparent or\r\nopaque enamels are produced. The former are really coloured glasses,\r\nthe latter are glasses in which is enclosed the sintered colouring\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nWhilst enamels were formerly of importance only for artistic purposes,\r\nthey have recently attained great industrial employment; not only is\r\nearthenware now covered with enamel, and thus made to resist the attack\r\nof chemical reagents, but boiler tubes are lined with enamel to prevent\r\nthe formation of scale.\r\n\r\nThe colours used for enamels must in all cases be metallic oxides; for\r\nyellow, silver and antimony oxides; for red, gold, copper oxide and\r\nferric oxide; for blue, cobalt compounds; for green, copper oxide or\r\nchromium oxide. Two operations are required in the production of enamel\r\ncolours, the preparation of the flux and its fusion with the real\r\ncolouring substance. In most cases the latter operation takes place\r\nsimultaneously with the fixation on the enamelled article, but the\r\nenamels may be melted and cast into lumps, which are then powdered.\r\n\r\n=White Enamels.=—These are always ordinary crystal glass, to which tin\r\ndioxide or potassium antimoniate has been added. Particular care must\r\nbe taken that only pure raw materials are used, for almost unweighable\r\nquantities of iron compounds are sufficient to impart to the enamel a\r\nyellow tinge. In almost all cases the glass must be decolourised by the\r\naddition of pure pyrolusite (manganese dioxide), which at a red heat\r\ngives up a portion of its oxygen to the ferrous oxide contained in the\r\nglass, producing ferric oxide, which has much less colouring power. Too\r\nlarge a quantity of pyrolusite imparts a blue tinge to the enamel.\r\n\r\nThe tin dioxide used in the glaze is made by direct oxidation of tin\r\nin air. It has been found that tin burns much more easily in air when\r\nit is mixed with lead; 20 to 40 parts of tin are melted with 100\r\nparts of lead, and the alloy heated in shallow vessels in the air;\r\nit takes fire at a certain temperature, and it is only necessary to\r\nremove continually the layer of oxide in order to oxidise the whole\r\nof the metal within a short space of time. The mixture of oxides\r\nobtained in this manner is freed from particles of metal by grinding\r\nand levigation; when it is fused with the glass, the lead oxide enters\r\ninto combination, whilst the tin oxide is embedded in the colourless\r\nglass. When paste enamels are required the mass is melted in shallow\r\ncrucibles, poured into water and broken up to a coarse powder, which\r\nis again fused. In some cases this operation must be repeated several\r\ntimes to obtain a quite homogeneous product, for tin dioxide is very\r\nheavy and sinks to the bottom of the fluid glass; this is readily\r\nseen if the fused enamel is allowed to cool in the crucible. When the\r\ncrucible is broken the lower portions of the fused mass are dense\r\nwhite, whilst the upper are merely milky white. By repeatedly fusing\r\nthe mass it is endeavoured to obtain it uniform. In fusing the enamel\r\ncare must be taken that it is heated in a vessel from which the fire\r\ngases are completely excluded, since the smallest quantity of coal or\r\nof ferruginous ashes coming into contact with the melted mass would\r\ninjure its colour. If the melting point of the enamel is too high it\r\ncan be lowered by the addition of a small quantity of pure quartz sand.\r\n\r\nA fine white enamel is obtained by using litharge or red lead. The\r\nmixture contains 60 parts of quartz sand, 30 of alum, 35 of common\r\nsalt and 100 of red lead. It is advisable to add a small quantity of\r\nfinely-powdered talc to the sand. In consequence of the considerable\r\nproportion of alumina contained in this enamel it is difficult to melt,\r\nand can be heated to very high temperatures without injury to the shade.\r\n\r\nWhen antimony oxide is used a glass free from lead must be taken; lead\r\nglass does not give a pure white with antimony oxide. A very good white\r\nenamel is obtained by fusing 3 parts of crystal glass with 1 part of\r\nsodium antimoniate.\r\n\r\n=Coloured Enamels= owe their colour to metallic oxides. Enamels\r\ncoloured by metallic oxides, in which the oxygen is firmly united,\r\ncan be fired without great precaution, but if they contain oxides\r\neasily decomposed, great care is required to obtain a fine colour. In\r\nenamelling metals a white under-glaze is generally used beneath the\r\ncoloured enamel; it consists of a refractory white enamel. By this\r\nmeans it is more easy to obtain pure colours.\r\n\r\n=Yellow Enamels= are coloured by silver, antimony oxide combined with\r\nlitharge, or ferric oxide; from the latter a red can also be obtained.\r\nTo produce a yellow enamel by means of silver the article is first\r\nenamelled white at a low temperature; silver oxide is then applied\r\nwhere required, and the article again heated. It then frequently\r\nhappens that the surface has a metallic appearance owing to the\r\nreduction of a part of the silver oxide to metallic silver. When this\r\ncoating is scraped off the enamel beneath is found to be coloured a\r\nfine yellow.\r\n\r\nThe antimony yellow is obtained by mixing 1 part of antimony oxide, 1\r\npart of alum and 1 to 3 parts of white lead, according to the depth of\r\ncolour required. These finely-powdered materials are intimately mixed\r\nwith 1 part of sal ammoniac, and heated in an open vessel with stirring\r\nuntil the yellow colour appears. The vapours of the ammonium chloride\r\nindicate the proper temperature for the operation. When this substance\r\nis completely volatilised the temperature should not be further raised,\r\nor the mixture would fuse.\r\n\r\nBy means of ferric oxide a fine and durable yellow is produced; the\r\nquantity employed must not be too large, or a red colour will result. A\r\nvery high temperature is required for burning in this colour. The alum\r\nused in making the yellow enamel colours serves to prevent the oxides\r\nfrom fusing.\r\n\r\n=Red Enamel.=—Ferric oxide is generally used. When a purple red is\r\nrequired it is obtained either directly from metallic gold or from\r\npurple of Cassius.\r\n\r\nRed iron enamel is made by slowly heating 20 to 25 parts of pure\r\nferrous sulphate with 10 parts of aluminium sulphate until all the\r\nwater of crystallisation is expelled, when the temperature is gradually\r\nraised to an intense heat. The shade depends upon the temperature: the\r\nhigher it is the darker is the colour. Tests are taken from time to\r\ntime of the mixture, and rapidly cooled. Hot ferric oxide is black,\r\nconsequently the shade can only be judged with complete certainty in a\r\ncooled portion. Although the temperature required for the preparation\r\nof this colour is very high, yet it ought not to rise so far that the\r\nmagnetic oxide is produced, a small quantity of which would cause the\r\nenamel to appear dirty red, since it gives to the flux a blackish\r\ngreen colour. The red ferric oxide colour should not be dissolved in\r\nthe glass of the enamel, but should be embedded in it. Thus, when the\r\nenamel is burnt on, the temperature should not rise so high that ferric\r\nsilicate is formed, otherwise a yellow or even completely black enamel\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nPurple red is obtained by means of gold; formerly purple of Cassius\r\nwas exclusively employed for this purpose, but an equally bright red\r\ncan be obtained from gold chloride. The colour obtained from gold will\r\nbear only a very low heat; it must be mixed with a very fusible glass,\r\nbrought on to the article to be enamelled, and heated just sufficiently\r\nto melt the mass. The following mixture is used for gold red and other\r\ndelicate colours: 3 parts of calcined borax, 3 parts of quartz sand and\r\n1 part of chalk. A very small quantity of gold is sufficient to produce\r\na deep red, the amount of gold preparation used for a pale red or a\r\nmedium purple must be carefully weighed.\r\n\r\n=Blue Enamels= are always coloured by cobalt oxide. Any cobalt\r\ncompound can be used, since at a red heat the silica of the glass\r\ndisplaces other acids, and produces cobalt silicate. It is most simple\r\nto take cobalt nitrate. This salt is readily obtained completely pure,\r\nand absolute purity is of great importance, for only thus is a pure\r\nblue produced.\r\n\r\nCobalt oxide produces a more or less deep blue when fused with varying\r\nquantities of glass. In order to produce shades similar to turquoise\r\nand forget-me-not, a white enamel must be used beneath the blue, or\r\nbone ash must be mixed with the blue enamel; this produces a paler\r\ncolour, which is also opaque.\r\n\r\n=Green Enamel= is coloured by copper oxide or chromium oxide. In the\r\nformer case 1 part of copper oxide is used to 30 to 50 parts of glass,\r\naccording to the depth of shade required. The enamel made with copper\r\noxide alone has never a pure green colour; it exhibits a blue tinge. A\r\npure green is obtained by adding a very small amount of ferric oxide,\r\nwhich produces a yellow and compensates for the blue shade, so that a\r\npure green is formed.\r\n\r\nChromium oxide produces a beautiful emerald green without any addition.\r\nThe enamel may be exposed to very high temperatures without injury.\r\n\r\nGreen enamels may also be made by mixing blue cobalt enamel with a\r\nyellow enamel: an unexceptional shade results, but this method is\r\nseldom used, since green enamels are obtained in a simpler manner from\r\ncopper and chromium oxides.\r\n\r\n=Violet Enamel.=—Manganese dioxide is used exclusively to produce\r\nviolet enamel; an extremely small quantity is sufficient to colour a\r\nconsiderable quantity of glass. A pure violet shade is only obtained\r\nwhen very pure manganese dioxide is used; the artificially prepared\r\nsubstance should be used to produce the finest violet: the cost is\r\nconsiderably greater than that of the mineral pyrolusite, but equally\r\ngood results can rarely be obtained from pyrolusite.\r\n\r\n=Black Enamel.=—When a large quantity of ferric oxide, copper oxide or\r\ncobalt oxide is fused with a glass, a deep black enamel is obtained.\r\nGenerally mixtures of these oxides are used; experience has shown that\r\na much deeper black is thus obtained than from any one alone.\r\n\r\nNow that enamels are not used exclusively for artistic purposes, but in\r\nconsiderable quantities for earthenware and other technical purposes,\r\nthe manufacture of enamel colours has attained considerable importance;\r\nworks already exist occupied almost exclusively with this special\r\nbranch of manufacture.\r\n\r\nBy Lacroix’ process enamel colours are made which can be applied to\r\nporcelain without further admixture with a flux; for example, a very\r\nfine blue is made by dissolving 300 parts of pure alumina and 100\r\nparts of cobalt carbonate in nitric acid, evaporating the solution to\r\ndryness, igniting the residue and fusing it with 300 parts of quartz\r\nsand free from iron, 900 parts of crystallised boric acid and 1,800\r\nparts of red lead. A blue glass is obtained which easily melts, but\r\nis difficult to powder; but if poured when fluid in a thin stream\r\ninto cold water, it forms thin threads, which are very brittle in\r\nconsequence of the rapid cooling, and may be easily converted into a\r\nsoft powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nMETALLIC PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMetallic pigments do not always consist of metals; the name is also\r\napplied to compounds which possess a pronounced metallic lustre; mosaic\r\ngold, the preparation of which has been previously described, is an\r\nexample of such a pigment. Another variety of metallic pigment is made\r\nby heating finely-powdered alloys; a layer of oxide is thus produced\r\nupon the surface of the metallic particles, this layer produces a\r\nshade of the colour of the metal or alloy. Metallic pigments are only\r\nunalterable when they are composed of metals which are not changed\r\nby the action of the air. As a matter of fact, this property is not\r\npossessed by any of the metals used for this purpose; even gold and\r\nsilver are blackened by the action of the sulphuretted hydrogen in the\r\nair. This alteration proceeds, however, very slowly when the metal is\r\nenveloped by a layer of a binding medium, which is always the case when\r\nthe metallic powder is used for painting. There are many manuscripts,\r\nthe initial letters of which have been coloured by gold or silver,\r\nin which the metals retain their peculiar lustre after the lapse of\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nMetallic paints made from yellow alloys have never much durability:\r\nthey always contain copper, which readily alters; articles painted with\r\nimitation gold soon lose their lustre, and in the course of time become\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\n=Shell-Gold.=—This very expensive artists’ paint is made by rubbing\r\ngold-beaters’ refuse with gum solution upon a stone slab until a\r\ncompletely homogeneous mixture results, which is then rapidly thickened\r\nover the fire and generally allowed to dry in small shells. The\r\npreparation so made is known as shell-gold: it is sold at very high\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nThe operation of grinding the gold is very lengthy; it considerably\r\nincreases the cost of the already expensive material. The process may\r\nbe considerably shortened if the gold is obtained in a very finely\r\ndivided state by a chemical operation. For this process coins or broken\r\njewellery is heated in hydrochloric acid, and nitric acid gradually\r\nadded. The gold dissolves in the mixture. If it was alloyed with silver\r\na white precipitate of silver chloride is formed, which is filtered off\r\nafter largely diluting with distilled water. The solution is boiled\r\nfor some time to remove excess of nitric acid. A solution of ferrous\r\nsulphate is then added; the liquid at once becomes bluish black, and\r\nin a short time deposits a brown precipitate composed of chemically\r\npure gold, which is so finely divided that it is almost without the\r\ncharacteristic glitter of gold. The precipitate is filtered off, dried\r\nand preserved in stoppered bottles. In order to prepare shell-gold\r\nfrom this gold powder it is simply necessary to grind it with thick\r\ngum solution in a porcelain mortar; under the pressure of the pestle\r\nthe gold rapidly acquires its natural glitter. The grinding need only\r\nbe continued until the gold and gum solution are uniformly mixed.\r\nThe mixture so made should be at once filled into the shells, since\r\non standing the gold would soon separate from the gum solution in\r\nconsequence of its high specific gravity.\r\n\r\n=Shell-Silver.=—Genuine shell-silver can be made by rubbing silver leaf\r\nwith gum solution upon a slab exactly as genuine shell-gold. In this\r\ncase also the labour may be considerably lessened by converting the\r\nsilver into a state of fine division by a chemical process. Silver is\r\ndissolved in nitric acid, which must be quite free from hydrochloric\r\nacid, or insoluble silver chloride would be formed. In the operation\r\nbrown suffocating fumes are evolved which attack the respiratory\r\norgans; it should therefore be conducted in the open air or under a\r\nflue with a good draught. The silver solution, which is generally\r\ncoloured blue by admixed copper, is diluted with a large quantity of\r\ndistilled water. A sheet of copper is then dipped into the liquid and\r\nrapidly moved about in it. The silver then separates as a dark grey\r\npowder; after washing it is chemically pure, and when ground with gum\r\nsolution it produces genuine shell-silver.\r\n\r\nShell-silver and shell-gold are rarely used in painting on account of\r\ntheir cost; they are chiefly used for illuminated manuscripts. When\r\nthese metallic pigments are to be used in oil painting, in place of\r\ngum they must be ground with a liquid which mixes with boiled oil or\r\nessential oils. For this purpose copaiba balsam is to be recommended.\r\n\r\n=Imitation Silver.=—The imitation silver pigments are made from an\r\nalloy of tin and bismuth, or from a tin amalgam. The latter is most\r\neasily made by melting tin in a porcelain dish and adding one quarter\r\nof its weight of mercury; the mixture is then well stirred, and\r\nallowed to cool. It quickly solidifies to a crystalline mass, which is\r\ntolerably brittle and can be powdered without difficulty. To obtain a\r\nsubstance of a true silvery appearance the amalgam must be converted to\r\na powder of a certain degree of fineness. If the powdering is carried\r\ntoo far the product loses a great part of its metallic lustre, and\r\nacquires a dull grey colour.\r\n\r\nThe bismuth alloy is made by fusing 100 parts of tin, adding 100\r\nparts of bismuth, and then 10 parts of mercury. It is not absolutely\r\nnecessary to add mercury, but the addition has the advantage that the\r\nsolid alloy is far more easily powdered. The imitation silver made by\r\nthis process has a white metallic colour approaching that of genuine\r\nsilver, but not equal to it, especially in lustre. It is, however,\r\nlargely used in the industries on account of its low price; for\r\nexample, for paper hangings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nBRONZE PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be anticipated from the name that bronze pigments were\r\ncomposed of an alloy of copper and tin; in reality the alloy is\r\ncomposed of copper and zinc, _i.e._, brass. The bronze pigments are\r\nmade by a similar process to that described for genuine gold and silver\r\npigments. The waste produced in the manufacture of imitation gold leaf\r\nis ground with a solution of dextrine upon a slab until the mixture is\r\nuniform and separate metallic particles can be perceived only through\r\na lens. Whilst genuine gold and silver paints are always made in small\r\nquantities, on account of the expensive nature of the material, and\r\nmachinery is not employed, the bronze pigments are in different case;\r\nthe use of mechanical arrangements is necessary for producing the fine\r\nsubdivision, otherwise the bronze would be very dear on account of the\r\ngreat cost of grinding. The mechanical arrangements required to divide\r\nthe alloy are of the ordinary nature, but special machines have been\r\nconstructed for the manufacture of bronze pigments, by which the metal\r\nis far more quickly converted into powder than by means of grinding\r\nmachinery. These machines consist of metal drums studded on the\r\ninterior with a large number of fine needles and capable of very rapid\r\nrotation. When a metal powder already tolerably fine is brought into\r\nthese drums, it is rapidly brought to such a condition of fine division\r\nas would be attained by hand grinding only by prolonged and laborious\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nThe raw material for the manufacture of bronze powders is produced\r\nin making imitation gold and silver leaf; the waste metal obtained\r\nin beating the sheets is used. The employment of this waste has two\r\nadvantages: the metal is already in very thin sheets and is composed of\r\nalloys varying in colour from silver white, through gold, to a bright\r\ncopper. In making leaf metal the waste of each colour is kept carefully\r\nseparate, so that it simply requires to be broken up to produce bronze\r\npowders of different shades.\r\n\r\nBefore this waste is brought into the drums mentioned above it must be\r\nsubjected to a preliminary grinding in a mortar with a small quantity\r\nof a fatty oil, which serves to bind together the mass. Sufficient oil\r\nshould be used to give the mass some degree of coherence; if too much\r\noil is added the space between the needles of the drum would be coated\r\nwith the mass and the process in the drum would require a much longer\r\ntime. The uniform mixture of oil and bronze waste is then brought\r\nupon a wire sieve of the finest possible mesh, and the mass is rubbed\r\nthrough by means of a fine metal brush into a vessel below; thus the\r\nlarger particles are retained by the sieve and only those which are\r\nsmaller than the mesh pass through. The product of this process is\r\nthen brought into the drums, which are rapidly revolved; the small\r\nparticles of metal are thrown with great force against the side and\r\nare converted by the fine points with which it is studded into a very\r\nfine powder. The time required for this process depends on the rate of\r\nrevolution and on the quantity of powder treated at once. The drums are\r\nstopped from time to time and the contents examined. When the powder\r\nis sufficiently fine it is taken out of the drum. This is most easily\r\naccomplished if the drum is arranged to take apart into two halves.\r\n\r\nIn most works it is usual to free the bronze powder from the admixed\r\noil by subjecting the mass to the greatest pressure that can be\r\nproduced by a very powerful hydraulic press. The oil which flows\r\nfrom the press is always green, which shows that chemical action has\r\ntaken place. In consequence of the large surface imparted to the oil\r\nit becomes speedily rancid, and then contains free fatty acids which\r\nattack copper very energetically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.]\r\n\r\nThe use of hydraulic presses may be avoided by removing the oil\r\nby means of a solvent. Fatty oils dissolve very readily in carbon\r\nbisulphide, but this solvent cannot be used in this case, because\r\ncommercial carbon bisulphide always contains dissolved sulphur, which\r\nwould blacken the bronze powder. Petroleum ether and benzene are very\r\nsuitable solvents for this purpose. On account of the volatility of\r\nthese inflammable liquids lights must be absolutely excluded from the\r\nroom in which they are used, and in order to avoid loss of solvent\r\nthe bronze powder must be treated in closed vessels. The safest plan\r\nis to use a special apparatus of simple construction to dissolve\r\nthe oil. Fig. 35 shows the construction of an arrangement suitable\r\nfor this purpose. It consists of a cylindrical vessel of tin plate\r\nsurrounded by a rim into which fits the edge of the cover. When the\r\nlid is placed on and the rim filled with water, the contents of the\r\nvessel are closed in air-tight and cannot evaporate. The lower portion\r\nof the vessel is conical, and is joined to a pipe in which is a tap,\r\nand which communicates at the side by a tube with the glass vessel in\r\nwhich the solvent is contained; another tube connects the neck of this\r\nvessel with the cover. When this apparatus is used for extracting the\r\noil from bronze powder, a filter of strong blotting paper is placed\r\nin the conical portion of the vessel, care being taken that it fits\r\naccurately so that it is not torn by the weight of the bronze. The oily\r\nbronze powder is placed on this filter, the cover set on, and the rim\r\nfilled with water. By opening the tap attached to the solvent reservoir\r\nthe liquid is allowed to enter the cylinder from below, the air in the\r\nlatter passing through the tube in the cover to the reservoir. After\r\nsome hours the oil is dissolved, the tap in the cover is then opened\r\nand the liquid run off by opening the lowest tap. If the bronze powder\r\nis not quite free from oil after one treatment with the solvent, the\r\noperation is repeated with a fresh quantity.\r\n\r\nWhen free from oil the powder and filter are removed from the apparatus\r\nand dried; the dry mass forms a solid cake, which is broken up in a\r\nmortar and by a little grinding changed into a fine powder.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the bronze powder is the same as that of the alloy used,\r\nbut the shade is always rather paler than that of the coherent metal;\r\nregard must be paid to this circumstance in making a bronze of a\r\ndetermined colour: the alloy employed must have a rather deeper colour\r\nthan the shade the bronze is to possess.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of leaf metal and bronze powder is frequently conducted\r\nin the same works, which also often prepare the requisite alloys; we,\r\ntherefore, give a few examples of the composition of the alloys which\r\nproduce certain shades. The more zinc the alloys contain the lower is\r\ntheir melting point, the greater their brittleness and hardness and\r\nthe paler their colour. An increase in the copper causes the colour\r\nof the alloy to approach more nearly to that of gold, and increases\r\nthe malleability, a property useful in making leaf metal, but not\r\ndesirable in making metallic powder. A zinc copper alloy which contains\r\nbetween 1 and 7 per cent. of zinc has an almost pure red, or even a\r\ndark red colour; an alloy containing 7·4 to 13·8 per cent. of zinc has\r\na pure golden yellow colour, between 16·6 and 25 per cent. of zinc a\r\nyellow appears. An increase of the percentage of zinc above this point\r\nproduces the colour of brass; it is noteworthy that an alloy containing\r\nstill more zinc, 33 to 41 per cent., again shows a reddish colour,\r\nwhich is most developed when the alloy contains equal parts of zinc and\r\ncopper. If the zinc is increased still further the shade gradually goes\r\nover to white; this change is already observed in an alloy containing\r\n51 per cent. of zinc, which shows a pure golden yellow colour, and is\r\nvery brittle. When the zinc rises to 53 per cent. the colour is reddish\r\nwhite; at 56 per cent. it is yellowish white, at 64 per cent. bluish\r\nwhite, and between 75 and 90 per cent. the alloy is bluish-grey.\r\n\r\nThe alloys for bronze powders of different shades have the following\r\ncomposition, according to R. Wagner:—\r\n\r\n                      Copper,          Zinc\r\n                     per cent.       per cent.\r\n    Pale yellow         83             17\r\n    Red                 94-90           6-10\r\n    Deep red           100\r\n\r\nBronzes from English, French and Bavarian works contain the following\r\npercentages of copper:—\r\n\r\n      ENGLISH BRONZES.\r\n    Orange          9·82 per cent.\r\n    Deep yellow    82·37    ”\r\n    Pale yellow    80·42    ”\r\n\r\n      FRENCH BRONZES.\r\n    Copper red     97·32 per cent.\r\n    Orange         94·44    ”\r\n    Pale yellow    81·29    ”\r\n\r\n     BAVARIAN BRONZES.\r\n    Copper red     98·92 per cent.\r\n    Violet         98·82    ”\r\n    Orange         95·30    ”\r\n    Straw yellow   81·55    ”\r\n    Speiss yellow  82·34    ”\r\n\r\nIn each case the remainder of the alloy consists entirely of zinc.\r\n\r\nAlloys containing from 1 to 35 per cent. of zinc are only malleable\r\nin the cold. The malleability is at the greatest with a content of\r\nzinc between 15 and 20 per cent.; such alloys are the most suitable\r\nfor making leaf metal. Alloys containing between 36 and 40 per cent.\r\nof zinc may be hammered either cold or hot, whilst the former alloys\r\nbecome brittle on heating. When the percentage of zinc is still further\r\nincreased the malleability decreases. The most brittle alloys contain\r\n60 to 67 per cent. of zinc.\r\n\r\nThe alloys are made in a furnace with a good draught, for copper\r\nliquefies at a very high temperature. To prevent loss of copper by\r\noxidation the molten metal should not come in contact with air; it\r\nshould be covered by a layer of red·hot coal, which prevents oxygen\r\nfrom reaching it. When the copper is completely melted, which is\r\nascertained by stirring with a piece of wood, the whole of the zinc\r\nis added. Some skill is required in this operation, otherwise a large\r\nproportion of the zinc will be volatilised, and the vapours will burn\r\nwhen they come in contact with air, in which case dazzling bluish white\r\nflames are seen over the crucible. The best method is to throw the zinc\r\ninto the crucible and immediately stir it into the molten metal with\r\na wooden rod. The products of the dry distillation of the wood, which\r\nare given off in great quantity at this high temperature, keep the air\r\nfrom the surface of the metal and prevent the oxidation of the zinc\r\nvapours. The zinc is thoroughly mixed with the copper by stirring with\r\nthe wooden rod, the crucible is then slowly cooled, with the precaution\r\nthat the surface of the metal is kept covered by red-hot coals so long\r\nas the metal is fluid. When sufficiently cool the metal is poured into\r\nshallow iron moulds, in which it quickly solidifies; it is then rolled\r\ninto sheets, which may be converted into thin leaves by hammering in a\r\nsimilar manner to that in which the gold-beater makes gold leaf.\r\n\r\nTo obtain bronze powders of different shades alloys of different\r\ncolours may be used; the bronze powders may also be shaded by two\r\nmethods—either by adding certain colouring matters of very great\r\ncolouring power or by partially oxidising the finely divided metallic\r\npowder. In the first process the finely ground colouring matter is\r\nmechanically mixed with the bronze powder. The use of manual labour\r\nwould involve a great loss of time; even when quite small quantities of\r\nbronze and colouring matter are mixed in a mortar it is necessary to\r\ngrind diligently for a very long time before a mixture of homogeneous\r\nappearance is obtained. In working on a somewhat larger scale it is\r\ntherefore advisable to adopt mechanical mixing arrangements. A very\r\nsimple apparatus suffices. A sheet-iron cylinder is used which can be\r\nrevolved, and provided with a well-fitting slide. In this cylinder are\r\nplaced the bronze powder and the colouring matter until it is about\r\nhalf full; then, after tightly closing the slide, it is set in slow\r\nrotation, which is continued until a test taken out shows a uniform\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nWhen bronze powder is slowly heated in a shallow vessel the colour\r\nbegins to darken at a temperature not much above the boiling point of\r\nwater. In consequence of the fineness of the particles of the metallic\r\npowder the copper readily takes up oxygen, and is superficially\r\nconverted into copper oxide. This oxide is of a darker colour, and thus\r\nby this method the shade of the bronze can be deepened as desired.\r\nThis simple operation requires a certain amount of practice to produce\r\na product of a determined shade. The desired result is most safely\r\nattained when the bronze is spread out quite uniformly in a thin layer\r\nupon a metal plate, which is gently heated from below. The powder soon\r\nbegins to darken; by cooling the plate the progress of the oxidation\r\nmay be arrested at any moment.\r\n\r\nRecently bronze powders have come into the market showing all possible\r\ncolours in the deepest shades, by the aid of which very remarkable\r\ncolour effects can be produced. These bronzes are made by dissolving\r\nan aniline dye in a little alcohol, pouring this solution over the\r\npowder, and mixing the dye uniformly through the whole of the bronze by\r\nworking the mass for a sufficient length of time. In this way bronze\r\npowders are produced which possess a green, red, blue or violet lustre,\r\naccording to the colour of the dye used. These colours with metallic\r\nlustre can also be produced by bronzing the article with a white (zinc)\r\nbronze, and then coating it with a varnish in which the required\r\naniline dye is dissolved. A bronze with a fine golden red glitter is\r\nproduced by applying a golden yellow bronze and then a varnish in\r\nwhich a little aniline red is dissolved. It should be observed here\r\nthat these effects, produced by a coat of varnish in which an aniline\r\ndye is dissolved, only turn out well when the dye is used in very\r\nsmall quantity, for these colours are the strongest with which we are\r\nacquainted, and in colouring power far surpass cochineal carmine, which\r\nis renowned for this property.\r\n\r\nWhen bronze is coloured by dyes the most varied shades can be obtained\r\nwith a metallic lustre. According to Conradty a very fine blue bronze\r\nis obtained by boiling white bronze for some hours with a weak alum\r\nsolution, washing and drying, and then mixing in a mortar with a\r\nstrong solution of aniline blue in alcohol until the solvent has\r\nevaporated. This operation is repeated until the desired depth of shade\r\nis obtained. The bronze is then washed with pure water. Conradty also\r\nrecommends that the coloured bronze should be ground with a little\r\npetroleum, and then exposed to the air to allow the petroleum to\r\nevaporate. This operation, for which no chemical reason can be given,\r\nis quite unnecessary. If other dyes or mixtures of them are used in\r\nplace of aniline blue, bronzes of corresponding colour are obtained.\r\n\r\nHowever handsome are the bronzes coloured by this process, nearly all\r\nhave the disadvantage that the colours have little permanence, and\r\nquickly fade when exposed to light. This is especially the case when\r\nthe bronzed article is coated with an oil varnish; if, however, a\r\nspirit varnish is used, or indeed any varnish composed of a resin and a\r\nvolatile solvent, the colour of the bronze, protected by the layer of\r\nresin, remains quite unaltered for a long time.\r\n\r\n=Electrolytic Copper Bronze.=—Electrolytically precipitated copper may\r\nbe used as a bronze pigment; it is most simply made by adding pieces\r\nof metallic zinc to a solution of copper sulphate free from iron and\r\nviolently shaking the flask for a long time. The liquid becomes warm,\r\nand the copper separates in the form of a very fine precipitate, which\r\nis collected on a filter and washed with air-free water (boiling water\r\nis best) and then quickly dried. The upper portions of the precipitate\r\nin the filter, which are exposed to the air, have generally a brownish\r\ncolour due to the incipient oxidation of the finely divided metal. They\r\nare removed, and the lower portions show the characteristic colour of\r\npure copper.\r\n\r\nIn the same way silver can be precipitated from a solution of silver\r\nnitrate in a finely divided state, but the particles of the silver\r\npowder are so very small that they reflect very little light, and\r\nconsequently the powder has an unsightly grey colour. When a surface\r\npainted with this silver is rubbed gently with a hard body, the\r\nmetallic lustre appears.\r\n\r\n=Tungsten Bronze Pigments= are expensive and rarely employed. They\r\nare obtained by fusing sodium or potassium tungstate in a porcelain\r\ncrucible and gradually adding tungstic acid until the mass has an\r\nacid reaction. Tin dioxide is then added in quantity sufficient to\r\nneutralise the tungstic acid; the mass is cooled and finely powdered.\r\nAccording as potassium or sodium tungstate is used, a violet or reddish\r\npigment is obtained which exhibits the peculiar metallic lustre of a\r\nbronze powder.\r\n\r\nStill more costly is vanadium bronze, which is made by adding ammonium\r\nvanadate to a solution of 2 parts of copper sulphate and 1 part of\r\nammonium chloride with continual stirring, until the precipitate no\r\nlonger re-dissolves on stirring. The liquid is then heated for several\r\nhours to about 35° C., when vanadium bronze separates in golden yellow\r\nscales. These are collected on a filter, washed and dried When ground\r\nwith oil or gum solution they can be used as a red gold bronze. The\r\ncolour is unaltered by the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE BRONZE PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder this apparently contradictory term, substances come into the\r\nmarket which produce a peculiar metallic lustre. When applied under\r\ncertain conditions, the appearance is similar to that produced by real\r\nbronze. The vegetable bronze pigments are lakes as pure and free from\r\nforeign admixtures as possible. The lakes obtained from red wood or\r\nlogwood can be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nFrom the red woods (_see_ p. 384) a magnificent bronze pigment can be\r\nobtained, which is either pure golden yellow or possesses a greenish\r\ngolden metallic lustre not unlike the colour of the wing cases of\r\nthe rose-bug. To obtain either shade a pure lake is first made by\r\nextracting red wood with boiling water, adding a little carbolic\r\nacid to the decoction (0·01 per cent. of the quantity of liquid) and\r\nallowing to stand for several weeks. The liquid is syphoned off from\r\nthe deposit, heated, and alum added equal in quantity to 10 per cent.\r\nof the wood used. The mixture is then allowed to stand for about a\r\nweek, the precipitate is filtered off, washed, and, if necessary,\r\ndried. If the bronze is to be used in the form of water colour, the\r\nprecipitate is dried to a thick paste and mixed with about 10 per cent.\r\nof its volume of thick gum solution, so that a viscid mass is obtained\r\nwhich can just be applied with the brush. When the coating is made so\r\nthick as to hide the surface of the bronzed article, it has when dry\r\nthe golden green colour.\r\n\r\nIn using this lake to prepare a pigment similar to gold bronze it must\r\nbe almost completely dried, and then mixed with the liquid obtained\r\nin the following manner: White soap is melted on the water bath with\r\nthe smallest possible quantity of water, and when completely dissolved\r\nthe same quantity of white wax is stirred in, finally water is added,\r\nso that the cooled liquid has the consistency of a moderately thick\r\nvarnish. When this liquid is ground with the requisite quantity of the\r\nstill damp lake and the mixture applied to paper, wood, or leather, and\r\nafter drying rubbed with a glass ball, it gradually acquires a very\r\nfine golden bronze colour. This method of bronzing is largely used\r\nin the manufacture of wall papers and for colouring fancy leather.\r\nTo protect this coating against the action of water, it should be\r\nvarnished when dry.\r\n\r\nThese bronze pigments may also be used in varnish. The lake is then\r\ncompletely dried and ground with varnish in such quantity as to give a\r\nthick mass which can just be brushed on.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable bronze is obtained from logwood in a similar manner, a\r\nsolution of stannic chloride being generally used to precipitate the\r\nlake when a deep bronze is required, and alum for a pale gold shade.\r\nBy using mixtures of the two salts intermediate shades are produced.\r\nThe precipitate produced by alum may be shaded by means of potassium\r\nbichromate. Hæmatoxylin forms with chromium oxide a deep bluish black\r\ncompound which has such intense colouring power that it is used to\r\ncolour writing ink. The ink is prepared by adding a little potassium\r\nbichromate to a decoction of logwood. If a very small quantity of this\r\ndark precipitate is mixed with the lake precipitated from logwood\r\nextract by alum solution, colours are produced possessing the peculiar\r\nmetallic lustre and a shade depending upon the quantity of potassium\r\nbichromate added. The addition of this salt must be very carefully\r\nmade, as a very small excess is sufficient to render the colour so dark\r\nthat it is useless as a bronze. The shade of the precipitate depends\r\nupon the concentration of the liquid and other conditions, so that\r\nit is impossible to give precise quantities. In practice, the safest\r\nand most convenient method is to dissolve the bichromate in a large\r\nquantity of water and add very small quantities of the dilute solution\r\nto the logwood extract along with the alum. After each addition a\r\nportion of the precipitate is rapidly mixed with the above-mentioned\r\nsolution of soap and wax, to which a little size has been added, and\r\nthen spread upon paper. If the desired shade has not yet appeared, a\r\nlittle more bichromate is added and another test made, and the process\r\nrepeated until the proper shade is attained.\r\n\r\nPigments for colouring wall papers and fancy leather are not easily\r\nmade which produce such fine effects at so small a cost as the\r\nvegetable bronze pigments, which deserve the greatest regard from the\r\ncolour maker and leather and paper manufacturers.\r\n\r\n=Appendix—The Brocade Pigments (”Brocatfarben”).=—Under this\r\ndesignation powders have been recently introduced characterised by\r\na strong metallic or glassy lustre, and very suitable for certain\r\npurposes, such as the manufacture of wall papers, since they enable\r\nremarkably fine effects to be produced. They consist of mica in a\r\ntolerably fine state of division. Mica is a mineral which occurs\r\nfrequently in nature and which very readily splits into thin sheets;\r\nit occurs in various colours. In thin sheets mica is colourless and\r\ncompletely transparent; in somewhat thicker pieces it generally shows a\r\ndistinct metallic lustre similar either to that of gold or silver. When\r\nground to fairly fine powder, it has the same gold or silver lustre,\r\nand gold or silver brocade colours are distinguished in commerce. They\r\nare made by grinding mica which has been previously sorted according\r\nto its appearance. The powdered mica can be sold as powder or may be\r\nmixed with a binding substance in order to be ready for use. Gum Arabic\r\nis generally used as the binding medium, but it can be replaced by the\r\ncheaper dextrine. When printed upon paper the brocade pigments produce\r\nthe effect of a bronze, and in addition to their cheapness they have\r\nthe great advantage of being completely unaltered by the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIGMENTS OF ORGANIC ORIGIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nLAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pigments commercially designated lakes generally consist of an\r\norganic colouring matter united with a metallic oxide. In isolated\r\ncases other compounds of colouring matters are included under the term,\r\nsuch as indigo sulphonic acid, and yet more rarely pure colouring\r\nmatters are included, for example carthamine red. But the overwhelming\r\nmajority of lake pigments are compounds of a colouring matter with\r\nthe oxide of a metal. For this purpose the oxides of tin, lead and\r\naluminium are commonly used.\r\n\r\nLakes are generally made by mixing the solution of the colouring matter\r\nwith the solution of a salt of the metallic oxide, and precipitating\r\nthe oxide by an alkali. The colouring matter is separated along with\r\nthe oxide and forms with it a substance known as a lake. It has not\r\nyet been decided whether the lakes are true chemical compounds of the\r\ncolouring matter with the metallic oxide, or whether the colouring\r\nmatter is simply held fast by the surface attraction of the finely\r\ndivided oxide. In favour of the latter view is the fact that a larger\r\nor smaller quantity of the colouring matter can be united with a given\r\nquantity of the oxide.\r\n\r\nThe lakes vary greatly in durability; some, such as the madder lakes,\r\ncan be counted among the most durable pigments, whilst others have very\r\nlittle permanence, as for example, the logwood lakes.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the colouring matters used in the preparation of lakes\r\nare of vegetable origin, but several are derived from animal sources.\r\nThe properties of the colouring matters used for this purpose vary\r\ngreatly; each material demands a special treatment for the production\r\nof lakes. Therefore, in describing the methods by which lakes are made,\r\nwe shall give first the properties of the colouring matter in question,\r\nand then proceed to the preparation of the lake. In the preceding\r\nportion of the book the pigments have been arranged according to their\r\ncolour; the lakes will be described in the same order. The yellow, red\r\nor green lakes of different origin will be treated in the same section\r\nin order to facilitate reference to any particular pigment.\r\n\r\nWhite lakes are not known, neither are there lakes which can be\r\ndescribed as black. With these exceptions lakes of all colours can be\r\nmade and also of all shades. As an example of this madder lake may be\r\ngiven, which is found in commerce in a great variety of shades; it\r\ncan be made from the palest rose-red to the deepest purple red, or,\r\nmore properly, madder red, which is a characteristic shade. The shades\r\nof any lake are obtained by mixing in a white pigment just as in the\r\nmanufacture of mineral pigments. Whilst, however, in the latter case\r\nthe white pigment must often be mechanically mixed with the colour, the\r\nshading of the lakes is accomplished in their preparation. Generally\r\nspeaking, a pale shade of a lake is obtained by increasing the amount\r\nof the salt, the oxide of which is used to precipitate the colouring\r\nmatter. The oxides in question are white (with the exception of lead\r\noxide); thus in the pale shades a small amount of colouring matter is\r\nprecipitated upon a large amount of oxide, whilst in the deep lakes\r\nthe reverse is the case, a large quantity of colouring matter is\r\nprecipitated upon a small quantity of oxide, and the shade thus appears\r\nvery deep.\r\n\r\nApart from the nature of the colouring matter contained in a lake,\r\nand considering only the metallic oxide with which the colouring\r\nmatter is united, it appears that lakes containing lead oxide have\r\nlittle durability. The combination between the colouring matter and\r\nthe metallic oxide in a lake is so loose that it is easily destroyed\r\nby sulphuretted hydrogen; if a lake containing lead is exposed to the\r\naction of air containing that gas the colour will, in the course of\r\ntime, inevitably blacken. The lakes containing tin are also susceptible\r\nto sulphuretted hydrogen; in air containing but a trace of this gas\r\nthey quickly lose their brilliance and in time are quite discoloured.\r\n\r\nAlumina is not affected by sulphuretted hydrogen, and must thus be\r\nregarded as the most suitable oxide for the preparation of lakes. It\r\nis generally applied in the form of alum, in the selection of which\r\ngreat care is necessary if fine colours are to be produced. Commercial\r\nalum frequently contains ferric oxide; when the alumina is precipitated\r\nsimultaneously with the colouring matter the ferric oxide is also\r\nthrown down, and is mixed with the lake, its dark colour influencing\r\nthe shade of the lake greatly to its disadvantage. The effect of the\r\nferric oxide upon the colour of the lake is so important that it is\r\nimpossible, for example, to obtain a pale red lake with alum containing\r\niron. To avoid the bad results given by alum containing iron it should\r\nbe examined before it is used, and if it is found to contain any\r\nconsiderable quantity of iron it should be rejected for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter alum a solution of stannic chloride is most commonly used to\r\nprecipitate lakes, but it must be free from stannous chloride; it\r\nproduces as a rule darker lakes than alum. Care must be taken that the\r\nstannic chloride solution is free from iron.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary process for making lakes is very simple: a clear\r\naqueous solution of the colouring matter is obtained; to this alum\r\nor stannic chloride solution is added in proportion to the amount of\r\ncolouring matter dissolved by the water; the metallic oxide is then\r\nprecipitated by an alkali. Sodium or potassium carbonate or caustic\r\nalkalis may be used; ammonia is very suitable for this purpose, since\r\nit is free from iron. The precipitant must be cautiously added, it\r\nis introduced in drops when the greater part of the colouring matter\r\nhas been precipitated; an excess of the alkaline solution would have\r\nconsiderable effect on the shade of the precipitate. The precipitated\r\nlake rapidly settles to the bottom of the almost colourless liquid; the\r\nsettling is particularly rapid when stannic chloride has been used. The\r\nliquid is then drawn off, the pasty residue brought upon a strainer,\r\nwashed several times with water, and dried in the air or in stoves.\r\n\r\nWhen dry, a properly prepared lake forms a mass of little coherence,\r\nand can be readily ground to a soft powder, which may then be ground\r\nwith oil or gum solution to produce oil or water paints. At the same\r\ntime the materials are added to the pure lake which are used to shade\r\nits colour; white pigments are generally employed for this purpose—the\r\npaleness of the shade is proportional to the amount of white pigment\r\nintroduced. Certain lakes are shaded by small quantities of other\r\ncolouring matters; for example, the admixture of a small quantity of\r\na blue pigment with a pure red lake produces a much deeper colour\r\ninclining to purple. If a small quantity of a red or blue colouring\r\nmatter is added to a yellow pigment there is produced a deeper yellow\r\ninclining to orange, or a yellow inclining to green, in proportion to\r\nthe quantity of the added colouring matter.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed that it is of great importance for the colour\r\nmaker to have a practised eye, sensitive to fine differences of\r\ncolour. He may then produce colours faultless in shade, for if by\r\nchance a colour does not turn out well it may be improved by judicious\r\nadmixtures. It is quite impossible to give definite rules for the\r\nmixing of colours; the estimation of a shade cannot be taught in words,\r\nit demands long practice. By the use of a system, provided the user\r\nhas normal eyes, very slight differences of colour can be readily\r\nestimated. A scale of colours should be made from pigments of pure\r\nand definite shades, in which scale successful mixtures are gradually\r\ninserted, so that a series is produced in which the separate pure\r\ncolours blend regularly into one another. Then, when it is required to\r\nproduce a pigment corresponding to a certain shade on the scale, with\r\na little practice the shade can be readily produced, for the scale\r\nindicates which colour predominates.\r\n\r\nThe so-called sap colours are generally characterised by very pure\r\nshades. They are produced by decomposing a lake by an acid or a strong\r\nbase, evaporating the solution of the colouring matter so obtained at\r\na gentle heat and mixing with gum, starch, or some other thickening\r\nmaterial to produce a mass of such consistency that it can be formed\r\ninto balls or sticks.\r\n\r\nThe decoctions of the dye-woods always contain other substances in\r\naddition to the colouring matters, which are precipitated with the\r\ncolouring matter, and somewhat injure its shade. When such a lake\r\nis decomposed the colouring matter is obtained in a purified form,\r\nthus showing its full beauty. This solution of the purified colouring\r\nmatter might be again precipitated with a salt solution and lakes be\r\nproduced which would be much brighter than the original, but the losses\r\nincidental to this double precipitation would be so great that the lake\r\nwould be made much too expensive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nYELLOW LAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nYellow colouring matters are widespread in nature; from them are\r\nobtained many yellow pigments used in dyeing and in the manufacture of\r\ncolours. The colours produced by the yellow vegetable colouring matters\r\nare not particularly bright; thus the yellow lakes are used chiefly\r\nto produce cheap pigments, whilst the inorganic pigments are used for\r\nbright yellows.\r\n\r\n=Dutch Pink.=—Several species of buckthorn (_Rhamnus_) contain a yellow\r\ncolouring matter—xanthorhamnin—which is obtained pure by extracting\r\nthe yellow berries with hot alcohol. On cooling, the impure colouring\r\nmatter separates; by repeated recrystallisation from alcohol it is\r\nobtained in the form of crystalline needles, which are soluble in water\r\nand alcohol.\r\n\r\nThe yellow lake known as Dutch pink is prepared from yellow (Persian)\r\nberries, by boiling the crushed berries with water and mixing the\r\nextract with a solution of alum. The lake is then precipitated by the\r\naddition of powdered chalk. As a rule, 500 parts of water are used to\r\n100 parts of berries, 20 parts of alum are added to the decoction, and\r\nthe mixture poured upon 75 parts of finely powdered chalk. The liquid\r\nis decanted off, the residue filtered, washed and dried. Commercial\r\nDutch pink is made from a mixture of the decoctions of yellow berries,\r\nquercitron bark and turmeric, to which the alum solution is added, and\r\nthen chalk. The precipitate is made into conical lumps, which are sold\r\nas Dutch pink, and used for ordinary painting and for colouring leather.\r\n\r\n=Weld Lake.=—The dyers’ weld (_Reseda luteola_) contains a yellow\r\ncolouring matter formerly much used in dyeing; a yellow lake can also\r\nbe obtained from it. When weld is boiled with water a deep yellowish\r\ngreen decoction is obtained, from which yellowish-green flocks separate\r\non cooling. The lake can be obtained from all parts of the plant except\r\nthe root, the flowering shoots giving the largest yield of colour; the\r\nlake is generally precipitated by alumina. Equal parts of weld and alum\r\nare boiled with water until the latter is dissolved and the liquid is\r\ncoloured deep yellow; the hot solution is quickly filtered through a\r\nthick linen cloth and soda solution gradually added in small quantities\r\nwith continual stirring so long as effervescence follows.\r\n\r\nAlum entirely free from iron is required to produce a bright yellow\r\nlake; a small quantity of iron has great influence on the shade. Weld\r\ncontains more or less tannin, which gives very dark blue or green\r\ncompounds with iron salts, the production of a very small quantity of\r\nwhich suffices to convert the yellow shade into an ugly dirty colour.\r\n\r\nChalk may be used instead of soda to precipitate the alumina; in this\r\ncase the precipitate will contain calcium sulphate in addition to the\r\nalumina compound of luteolin.\r\n\r\nWeld lake may be used in oil, or size, or as a water colour.\r\n\r\n=Gamboge Lake.=—Crude gamboge is the dried sap of certain East Indian\r\ntrees; it is used as an artists’ colour, but only in water; for use in\r\noil it is converted into a lake. A particular treatment is necessary\r\nto obtain a handsome lake. Gamboge is treated for several days with\r\nwater and the soft mass ground on the slab or in a mill until it forms\r\na uniform paste, which is mixed with water to a thick liquid, which is\r\nthen put through a fine sieve. A hot solution of alum is then added\r\nin the proportion of three parts of alum to one part of gamboge, the\r\nmixture is boiled in a wooden vessel and two parts of nitric acid added\r\nwhilst well stirring; finally a dilute solution of potash is added\r\nin small quantities until the liquid solidifies to a jelly, which is\r\nspread out in thin layers on filter cloth, well washed with water and\r\ndried at a gentle heat.\r\n\r\n=Prepared Gamboge.=—Crude gamboge cannot be used in oil painting\r\nbecause it never gives a uniform shade, but when the colouring matter\r\nis freed from admixtures and ground with oil, it gives a deep durable\r\ncolour of great beauty.\r\n\r\nThe colouring constituent of gamboge is a resin which is fairly soluble\r\nin strong alcohol, whilst the impurities are insoluble. The pure\r\ncolouring matter is obtained without great expense in the following\r\nmanner: Coarsely powdered gamboge is placed in a large flask with\r\nstrong alcohol; the flask is well closed, placed in a warm position\r\nand repeatedly shaken; the deep yellow solution is carefully poured\r\noff from the sediment, water is then added, when the colouring\r\nmatter separates in flocks. Only sufficient water should be added to\r\nprecipitate all the colouring matter; test portions of the liquid\r\nshould be examined from time to time, the alcohol can then be recovered\r\nby distillation and used again. The colouring matter separated from the\r\nalcoholic solution forms a hard mass on drying; it must be very finely\r\npowdered before it is ground in oil.\r\n\r\nThere are many other yellow lakes which can be obtained by adding\r\nalum to an aqueous decoction of the colour-bearing material and\r\nneutralising the liquid. Such decoctions are obtained from fustic,\r\nquercitron (_Quercus tinctoria_), young fustic (_Rhus cotinus_), the\r\nroot of barberry (_Berberis vulgaris_), annatto (the fruit of _Bixa\r\norrellana_), turmeric (the root of _Curcuma longa_), etc. The yellow\r\nlakes obtained from these sources are seldom used in painting, the\r\nmineral pigments are preferred on account of their finer appearance.\r\nThese colouring matters are largely used in dyeing to produce shades\r\nvarying from yellow to brown, the majority are also used in calico\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\n=Fustic Lake.=—Of the colouring materials mentioned above fustic\r\nproduces a lake which is so handsome that it deserves larger use in\r\npainting than it has yet found. ”Old fustic” is chipped immediately\r\nbefore use and extracted with boiling water; whilst still hot the\r\nextract is mixed with a hot solution of alum; on cooling a fine yellow\r\nprecipitate is formed, which when dry is frequently sold under the name\r\nof Dutch pink. (Genuine Dutch pink is made from a decoction of yellow\r\nberries; the majority of the pigments sold under this name are made\r\nfrom decoctions of mixtures of the different yellow dye wares.)\r\n\r\nTo obtain the best lake from fustic the alum used must be completely\r\nfree from iron, otherwise only a dirty green lake is produced. Since\r\nthe least trace of iron damages the shade of the colour, fustic lake\r\nis more frequently made by means of lead oxide. To obtain the lead\r\nfustic lake the decoction is allowed to stand for several days, so that\r\nthe morin, which together with maclurin forms the colouring principle\r\nof fustic, may separate; the liquid is filtered from the precipitate,\r\nand lead acetate solution added which has been boiled with litharge to\r\nsaturation, so that the most basic acetate is produced. The lead fustic\r\nlake has a deep yellow colour; it is well adapted for use in painting,\r\nbut, like all lead pigments, is not specially permanent in air. By\r\nadmixtures of levigated chalk or starch paler shades of the dull yellow\r\nlake are obtained.\r\n\r\n=Quercitron Lake.=—Lakes are seldom made from quercitron alone,\r\nalthough they possess a deep yellow colour; they are more frequently\r\nemployed in dyeing when they are produced directly upon the fibre.\r\nQuercitron lake can be made by treating the aqueous decoction of the\r\nground bark with tin crystals and a little alum solution. With tin\r\ncrystals alone a darker yellow lake is obtained than when alum is used\r\nat the same time. Different shades may thus be produced.\r\n\r\nExtract of quercitron bark comes into commerce as a greyish yellow\r\npowder under the name of flavine, which has great colouring power, and\r\nmay be used with advantage in the place of aqueous extracts of the bark.\r\n\r\nSince the discovery of the aniline dyes the applications of all lakes\r\nhave been largely extended, since the dyes enable brighter shades to be\r\nobtained without the many processes necessary when natural colouring\r\nmatters are used, and do not require so much skill on the part of the\r\nworkman. This applies not only to yellow colouring matters, but to the\r\nmany other colouring matters formerly used by the dyer. The principal\r\nreasons which have so quickly brought the new dyes to the front lie in\r\ntheir greater beauty and in the diminished labour required in their use.\r\n\r\n=Purree or Indian Yellow= must not be confounded with the yellow cobalt\r\npigment known also under the latter name. It is a compound of magnesia\r\nwith an organic acid—euxanthic acid. It is obtained from the urine of\r\ncows fed upon mango leaves. It comes into commerce in lumps weighing\r\nabout 50 to 60 grammes, which are dark brown on the exterior, but on\r\nfracture show a fine orange yellow colour. Indian yellow is little\r\nused, and is not likely to attain importance. Many cheaper colouring\r\nmatters equal in shade are known.\r\n\r\n=The Colouring Matter of Saffron.=—The dried stigma of the flowers of\r\nthe saffron, a species of _iris_, has been long used for colouring\r\nfoods. It contains a very handsome yellow colouring matter of a\r\ncharacteristic shade; formerly this was largely used in silk-dyeing,\r\nand especially for dyeing glove leather. It is practically now no\r\nlonger used; considerably cheaper aniline dyes produce an equally good\r\nshade. On account of its high price (1 kilogramme of saffron contains\r\nabout 60,000 stigmata) this material cannot be used for lakes,\r\nalthough they leave nothing to be desired in fineness of shade, but\r\nthey have no great permanence.\r\n\r\n=The Colouring Matter of Gardenia Grandiflora.=—The fruits of this\r\nplant, which are imported from Southern Asia, contain a beautiful dark\r\nyellow colouring matter, which, according to Rochleder, is identical\r\nwith the colouring matter of saffron. It is readily soluble in water;\r\nlakes of various shades can readily be obtained by the addition of\r\nsalts to the aqueous solution. Alum gives a pure yellow, lead acetate a\r\nyellowish red, and stannous chloride a dark orange red lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nRED LAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCHINEAL AND CARMINE.\r\n\r\nThe purple of the ancients was obtained from the shellfish _purpura_;\r\nit was so costly that it was regarded as an attribute of royalty.\r\nAccording to history the Tyrians discovered this colour; at any rate\r\nthey were able to use it for dyeing. In the writings of the ancients\r\nTyrian purple garments were regarded as the greatest luxury. The art of\r\nobtaining a purple from this source was lost; more recently it has been\r\nre-discovered, but the colour is found in no way to correspond with\r\nwhat we regard as a bright shade.\r\n\r\nWhen the Spaniards conquered Mexico they found an insect cultivated\r\nwhich produced a splendid red colouring matter. This insect, the\r\ncochineal, is parasitic upon certain cacti, especially _Cactus\r\ncoccinellifer_ and _Cactus opuntia_. The females only are used as\r\ncolouring material; the males are very small, and much fewer in number.\r\nThe cultivation of the proper species of cactus and of the cochineal\r\nhas spread to most tropical countries. The females, which are attached\r\nin enormous numbers, are brushed off and killed by heating upon hot\r\nplates. They then appear as grains of the size of millet seeds, with\r\na wrinkled surface covered with a silvery grey dust. This variety of\r\ncochineal is the best. Black cochineal also comes into commerce; it\r\nhas a brownish black colour. It is produced by killing the insects in\r\nboiling water, by which the grey dust which covers the living insect is\r\nremoved. Cochineal produces when ground an ugly reddish brown powder.\r\n\r\nThe animal nature of cochineal cannot be recognised by the naked\r\neye, it is seen on examination under the microscope; this has given\r\nopportunity for the most incredible adulterations of the costly\r\nsubstance. Cases have been known in which a paste chiefly composed of\r\nflour has been pressed into the form of cochineal, the grains coloured\r\nby some cheap red colouring matter, powdered with the dust from boxes\r\nin which cochineal has been packed, and placed upon the market as\r\ncochineal. The expert would not be deceived by this gross fraud, but\r\nanother method of adulteration is far more difficult to recognise;\r\ngenuine cochineal is brought into commerce from which the greater part\r\nof the colouring matter has been extracted, and which has been again\r\npowdered with the grey cochineal dust. Such extracted cochineal does\r\nnot produce the same brownish-red powder as the fresh substance.\r\n\r\nIn the cochineal insect there is a very large quantity of colouring\r\nmatter: it may reach 50 per cent. of the weight of the dry insect. The\r\ncolouring matter, which is known as carmine (the same name is also\r\napplied to its lake), is soluble in water with a fine red colour. When\r\ncochineal is extracted with water the operation must be often repeated,\r\nand each time fresh quantities of colouring matter are dissolved.\r\nThe cochineal may be exhausted by repeated boiling with water, but a\r\nlarge quantity of liquid containing little colouring matter is then\r\nproduced. In order to obtain a strong solution of the colouring matter\r\nthe cochineal must be powdered; this is difficult on account of the\r\nsoftness of the material, which does not give a fine powder, but a\r\npasty mass. The object is best attained by grinding the cochineal\r\nthrough a mill similar to a coffee mill, but since the grooves of the\r\nsteel cone, which effects the crushing, may be easily clogged, the mill\r\nmust be arranged so that the cone can be taken out and cleaned.\r\n\r\nThe colouring principle of cochineal is an acid, carminic acid, which\r\nwas obtained by its discoverer, Warren de la Rue, in the following\r\nmanner: 1 part of powdered cochineal is boiled with 40 parts of\r\nwater for 20 minutes; after standing, the liquid is poured off from\r\nthe sediment, and mixed with a solution of 6 parts of lead acetate,\r\nacidified by 1 part of acetic acid. The precipitate, which consists\r\nof impure lead carminate, is filtered from the colourless liquid and\r\ncarefully washed; whilst still wet it is suspended in water, through\r\nwhich sulphuretted hydrogen is passed; the lead carminate is decomposed\r\ninto lead sulphide and carminic acid, which dissolves in the water. The\r\ncolouring matter is not yet quite pure; the treatment with lead acetate\r\nand sulphuretted hydrogen must be repeated, the solution then obtained\r\nis evaporated at a low temperature, the residue dissolved in boiling\r\nalcohol, phosphoric acid added to decompose traces of lead carminate\r\nstill present, then ether, finally the clear liquid is separated from\r\nthe precipitate and evaporated. By this process carminic acid is\r\nobtained in a state of complete purity; unfortunately the process is\r\ntoo complicated for practical application. Pure carminic acid is a\r\npurple red mass, which transmits red light at the edges and forms a\r\npure scarlet red powder when ground. The aqueous solution gives, with\r\nalum and ammonia, a characteristic precipitate, the colour of which\r\nis the purest carmine-red; lead, zinc and copper salts produce purple\r\nred precipitates. The composition of carminic acid is expressed by the\r\nformula C₁₇H₁₈O₁₀.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nTHE MANUFACTURE OF CARMINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colouring matter of cochineal is used in the form of a lake under\r\nthe name of carmine, the finest and most expensive colour used in\r\npainting. However simple the preparation of carmine may appear, it\r\nis not easy to obtain a product of great beauty; certain conditions,\r\nstill unexplained, play an important part in the process. Until not\r\nlong ago the manufacture of fine carmine was regarded as a secret; this\r\nit is no longer, and with proper care any one may produce an entirely\r\nsatisfactory product. Many recipes have been given, some of the best\r\nwill be mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhatever method is used to obtain carmine certain precautions must\r\nbe taken, without which it is impossible to obtain a bright colour.\r\nAlkalis and alkaline earths in very small quantity affect the shade of\r\ncarmine, so that spring water should never be used in its preparation.\r\nPure rain water, or, still better, distilled water, should be employed.\r\n\r\nThe decoction of cochineal is difficult to filter. Paper cannot be\r\nused, because the pores are so rapidly stopped up that new filters\r\nwould be continually required. Fine silk is the most serviceable; it\r\nshould not be washed with soap—the alkalinity of the small quantity of\r\nsoap the fabric would retain would affect the colour. The decoction is\r\nmade in a well-tinned copper pan, all other vessels should be of glass\r\nor porcelain, which are most easily cleaned, and great cleanliness\r\nis the prime essential to the success of the process. The greatest\r\ncare is required to prevent the contact of the liquid with iron during\r\nthe whole process, the smallest trace of this metal would result in a\r\ndiscoloured product.\r\n\r\nThe essentials of the manufacture of carmine on the large scale are\r\nthat the colouring matter is dissolved in water, and precipitated by\r\nthe addition of an aluminium salt, generally alum, absolutely free from\r\niron. The more slowly the carmine separates the finer is its colour.\r\nIt is generally observed that the last portions to precipitate show\r\nthe brightest shade. This is because the foreign substances occurring\r\nwith the carminic acid in the decoction are thrown down with the first\r\nportions of the precipitate. In the process of Frau Cenette, famous for\r\nthe beauty of the product, a solution is made from which the whole of\r\nthe carmine is separated in about three weeks. During this long time\r\nthe majority of the substances which have been dissolved in the water\r\ntogether with the carminic acid are decomposed; the liquid acquires an\r\nunpleasant smell, and is covered with mould. In the author’s opinion\r\nso good a product is obtained by this process because the greater part\r\nof the impurities is decomposed: the nearer the product approaches the\r\npure compound of carminic acid and alumina, the purer and brighter will\r\nbe the shade of the carmine.\r\n\r\nIt is known that light has considerable influence on the beauty of\r\ncarmine. During dull winter days it is quite impossible to produce so\r\nfine a product as in summer. Instead of alum a tin solution may be\r\nused to precipitate the colouring matter; the shade of the product is\r\ndifferent to that of alumina carmine.\r\n\r\nCENETTE’S METHOD.—1 kilogramme of finely powdered cochineal is boiled\r\nwith 75 litres of water for two hours; 90 grammes of saltpetre are\r\nadded, the liquid boiled for three minutes, then 120 grammes of salt of\r\nsorrel (acid potassium oxalate) are added and the liquid again boiled\r\nfor ten minutes. The liquid is then completely clarified by standing,\r\ndrawn off from the residue by a syphon, and brought into shallow glass\r\ndishes which are placed, protected from dust, in a bright light in\r\na uniformly warm place. During several weeks the carmine separates,\r\nthe last portions being always brighter than the first. The addition\r\nof potassium oxalate has the object of assisting the separation of\r\nthe carmine, for acid salts separate the carmine from solutions; the\r\nsaltpetre may reasonably be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the recipes for carmine, which are frequently sold at a\r\nhigh price, differ but little from the above; acid potassium tartrate\r\nis used instead of the oxalate, but the latter is to be preferred\r\nbecause of the slight solubility of the tartrate. It is important\r\nnot to use too strong decoctions of cochineal, and to add only small\r\nquantities of alum. The clear liquid is placed in shallow glass dishes.\r\nAfter a few days the nature of the deposit should be examined: if a\r\nconsiderable quantity of a red precipitate has formed, the liquid is\r\npoured off into other dishes, in which carmine again separates during\r\nthe following days, and usually of a brighter colour than the first.\r\nFor example, 125 grammes of cochineal are boiled with 5 litres of water\r\nduring fifteen minutes, 30 grammes of very finely powdered alum are\r\nadded to the boiling liquid, which is again boiled for a few minutes,\r\nallowed to clarify and cool. The greater part of the carmine is then\r\nobtained in a few hours, but the liquid still separates carmine after\r\nseveral days.\r\n\r\nAccording to another formula 500 grammes of cochineal are boiled with\r\n30 litres of water, 60 grammes of cream of tartar are added, then\r\n30 grammes of alum, boiling is continued for several minutes, and\r\nthe liquid then allowed to cool. Carmine may be obtained in a very\r\nshort time by means of tin solution. The process is similar to that\r\njust given. The liquid which would be set aside for the spontaneous\r\ndeposition of the carmine is, however, returned to the pan, and a\r\nsolution of pure stannous chloride added in drops, so long as the\r\nsolution is still clearly red. The carmine separates at the bottom of\r\nthe pan; the liquid drawn off, even when it appears almost colourless,\r\nproduces a further small quantity of carmine in a few days.\r\n\r\nAccording to J. J. Hess, a brighter carmine is obtained when the fat of\r\nthe cochineal is previously extracted by ether or benzene.\r\n\r\nProposals have often been made to deepen the colour of prepared\r\ncarmine; this must be done with the greatest care, for it is very easy\r\nto produce a less handsome instead of a finer pigment. The carmine is\r\nmoistened with distilled water containing about 5 per cent. of ammonia\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nCarmine readily dissolves in ammonia. This property may be applied to\r\ntest its purity, pure carmine should dissolve without residue in 5 to\r\n6 times its quantity of ammonia. Any considerable residue denotes an\r\nintentional addition of some adulterant. Starch, vermilion, and cheaper\r\nlakes are used for this purpose. The red solution obtained by treating\r\ncarmine with the above quantity of ammonia may be used as a red ink.\r\nThis solution can also be used to purify carmine; when it is allowed to\r\nstand in an uncorked bottle for some time the ammonia escapes, and the\r\ngreater part of the carmine is deposited as a very fine powder.\r\n\r\nCarmine solution is made by dissolving carmine in the necessary\r\nquantity of ammonia, adding glycerine equal in quantity to the ammonia,\r\ndriving off the latter by heat and diluting the liquid. This solution\r\nis well adapted for colouring confectionery, but cannot be employed in\r\npainting and writing, since the glycerine would prevent it from drying.\r\n\r\nCarmine is extensively used in painting, and for many purposes cannot\r\nbe replaced by another pigment, _e.g._, the cosmetic known as vegetable\r\nrouge can be made from no other pigment. Carmine may be used in all\r\nmethods of colouring; it is quite harmless for confectioners’ purposes.\r\n\r\n=Munich, Vienna, Paris, or Florentine Lake.=—This fine deep red lake\r\ndiffers from carmine in containing a much larger quantity of alumina,\r\nthus possessing the character of an ordinary lake. Occasionally carmine\r\nlake is intentionally mixed with light white substances, such as\r\nmagnesia, to obtain paler shades or cheaper pigments.\r\n\r\nWhilst only the finest varieties of cochineal can be used to make\r\nfine carmine, the cheaper sorts can be used for Florentine lake. The\r\ncochineal used for carmine is boiled but a short time with water,\r\nso that the residue contains considerable quantities of colouring\r\nmatter, which may amount to half of that originally present. The same\r\nmaterials are used as in the preparation of carmine, and in this case,\r\ntoo, stress should be laid upon their purity. The weight of the alum\r\nis usually 10 to 15 times that of the cochineal; a little stannous\r\nchloride and cream of tartar are also added to brighten the shade. All\r\nthese materials are boiled with the cochineal, soda is added to the\r\nclear solution until effervescence no longer occurs, the separated lake\r\nis then washed. The lake may be made with magnesia instead of alumina,\r\nit is added in the form of magnesium sulphate; the more magnesia is\r\nused the paler is the lake. The proportions in which the materials are\r\nemployed vary with each manufacturer. The following quantities have\r\nalways given the author a favourable result: Cochineal 10 parts, alum\r\n150 parts, water 250 parts; or cochineal 10 parts, magnesium sulphate 5\r\nparts, alum 0·5 part.\r\n\r\nIn making Florentine lake a fairly deep colour should be produced.\r\nThis may be mixed without difficulty in the wet or the dry state with\r\na white pigment, thus producing any desired shade, even to the most\r\ndelicate rose-red.\r\n\r\n=Ammonia-Cochineal.=—This preparation, which is chiefly used by dyers,\r\nis obtained by treating cochineal in a well-closed flask with strong\r\nammonia, which dissolves the colouring matter. After about a month alum\r\nequal to about 3 per cent. of the amount of cochineal is added without\r\nseparating the undissolved residue from the solution, and the whole is\r\nevaporated at a gentle heat in a tinned pan until it becomes a stiff\r\npaste on cooling. The mass solidifies more readily if a small quantity\r\nof starch paste is added. ”Cochineal paste” is cochineal which has been\r\ntreated in this manner; it is generally brought into the market in the\r\nform of cakes or small slabs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the true cochineal other species of the same insect\r\ncontain a red colouring matter and have a restricted use in dyeing. The\r\nmost important of these is the Polish cochineal (_Coccus polonicus_),\r\nwhich lives on the roots of the _scleranthus_. It has not been proved\r\nthat these insects contain the same colouring matter as true cochineal,\r\nbut it is certain that the colouring matters of Polish and also of\r\nRussian cochineal (_Coccus euvæ ursi_) are far inferior in beauty to\r\nthat of true cochineal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nTHE COLOURING MATTER OF LAC.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the punctures of the insect _Coccus lacca_ on certain East Indian\r\ntrees, especially those belonging to the genus _Ficus_, flow at the\r\nsame time resin and colouring matter in such quantities that the\r\ninsects are frequently enclosed and large red masses are formed on the\r\ntrees. The insects live in some measure in these masses, the females\r\nlay their eggs in the spaces and the larvæ are said to feed on the red\r\nsap contained in the mass. When the larvæ have left the incrustation,\r\ngenerally in November, it is broken off from the branches and\r\ncollected. It is now known as stick-lac; it consists of large masses\r\nof resin of a fine deep red colour. In the interior the cells of the\r\ninsects may still be perceived. On chewing, it becomes soft and colours\r\nthe saliva a deep violet. When stick-lac is boiled in water a portion\r\nof the colouring matter dissolves. Good stick-lac contains 10 per cent.\r\nof colouring matter and 80 per cent. of resin.\r\n\r\nSeed-lac has the same origin as stick-lac, but frequently the greater\r\npart of the colouring matter has been extracted; it rarely contains\r\nmore than 2·5 per cent., and is consequently of little value for\r\ncolouring purposes.\r\n\r\n=Lac Dye.=—The colouring matter of stick-lac is generally separated\r\nfrom the resin in India and comes into the market under the name of\r\nlac dye. It is made by stirring coarsely powdered stick-lac in large\r\nvessels for several hours with warm water. Almost the whole of the\r\ncolouring matter dissolves, whilst the resin remains as a ruby red mass\r\nwhich is melted and brought into the market under the name of shellac.\r\nThe solution of the colouring matter is evaporated in shallow vessels\r\nin the sun or boiled down in pans; the residue is made into cakes. At\r\npresent soda solution is used instead of pure water to extract the\r\ncolouring matter; a larger yield is obtained. Lac dye usually contains\r\n45 to 50 per cent. of colouring matter, 25 per cent. of resin, and, in\r\naddition, earthy substances which are to be regarded as intentional\r\nadmixtures.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of lac dye by Stephen’s method coarsely powdered\r\nstick-lac is boiled with soda, and the remainder of the colouring\r\nmatter contained in the resin extracted by repeated boiling with\r\nwater. All the extracts are then united and precipitated by alum. The\r\ncolouring matter separates as a lake which still contains a large\r\nquantity of resin.\r\n\r\nAccording to the patented process of Henley, the colouring matter of\r\nseed-lac is extracted by hydraulic presses. The lac is filled into\r\npress bags which are placed between iron boxes heated by steam. On\r\napplying pressure the melted resin, shellac, comes through the bags,\r\nwhilst the colouring matter remains behind. If this method were\r\nemployed on the large scale, presses similar to those used in stearin\r\ncandle works would be suitable.\r\n\r\nWhen lac dye is treated with hydrochloric acid the colouring matter\r\ndissolves; the solution can be used to dye wool, which it colours a\r\nbeautiful red. The colouring matter is very similar in appearance to\r\nthat of cochineal, but has the appearance of much greater fastness. It\r\nappears also to be similar in composition to carminic acid, but little\r\nis known as to its chemical constitution.\r\n\r\nWhen lac dye is to be used for painting it must be freed from resin;\r\nthis is accomplished by treating the finely powdered mass for a long\r\ntime with boiling alcohol and separating the solution of resin from\r\nthe undissolved colouring matter, which is then dried. In this way a\r\nlake is produced known commercially as Vienna red and little inferior\r\nto carmine lake. Unfortunately the price of lac dye, although it is\r\nimported in large quantities from India to England, is so high that it\r\ncan only be used for artists’ colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nSAFFLOWER OR CARTHAMINE RED.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe safflower or bastard saffron (_Carthamus tinctoria_) grows wild\r\nin Southern Europe, and is also cultivated. It contains two colouring\r\nmatters, yellow and red. The former is not used in dyeing, but is\r\nemployed for colouring liqueurs, since it is innocuous. The red\r\ncolouring matter is used for colouring artificial flowers and for fine\r\ncosmetics; formerly it was employed in dyeing, but is now rarely used\r\nfor this purpose, since carthamine red has little permanence and can be\r\nreplaced by cheaper dyes.\r\n\r\nThe yellow colouring matter, which is not used, is generally removed\r\nby treating the corolla of the safflower, which contains the colouring\r\nmatter, with water. After this treatment it is known as washed\r\nsafflower. In the dried corolla of the flower up to 36 per cent. of the\r\nyellow colouring matter is found, whilst only 0·4 to 0·6 per cent. of\r\nthe red is contained.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the colouring matter of the safflower has been used\r\nfrom the most ancient times. The Chinese employ it to obtain a handsome\r\ncosmetic, the Tyrians are said to have used it in dyeing. In Europe it\r\nwas not cultivated before the seventeenth century, when it came into\r\nuse for dyeing.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain pure carthamine red—and this is the form in which\r\nit is generally used—safflower is treated for a long time with water\r\ncontaining a little acetic acid until a yellow solution no longer\r\nresults. The residue is then treated with soda solution for several\r\nhours, when the colouring matter dissolves; the solution is filtered\r\nand neutralised with acetic acid. Cotton is then introduced. Carthamine\r\nred is a colouring matter which at once dyes animal and vegetable\r\nfibres when these are brought in contact with its solution. Thus the\r\nwhole of the colouring matter is precipitated on the cotton, which is\r\ncoloured a deep red. After twenty-four hours the cotton is taken out,\r\nwashed, and treated with soda solution, in which the colouring matter\r\ndissolves. When this solution is carefully neutralised with citric acid\r\nthe colouring matter separates in the form of fine flocks. These are\r\ncollected, dissolved in strong alcohol, the solution evaporated to a\r\nsmall volume, the colouring matter again precipitated by the addition\r\nof a large quantity of water, and washed with pure water until the wash\r\nwaters begin to be coloured red. The pure carthamine thus obtained is\r\nspread upon small cups, in which it dries to a beautiful red mass which\r\nin somewhat thicker layers has a fine green lustre. It is brought into\r\ncommerce as ”cup red” or ”plate red”.\r\n\r\nThe small quantity of colouring matter contained in the safflower,\r\nas well as the complicated process for obtaining it, make it evident\r\nthat this colouring matter will be among the most expensive found\r\nin commerce. The high price is, however, neutralised by its great\r\ncolouring power, and by the fact that nothing can in all cases replace\r\nit for colouring the best artificial flowers.\r\n\r\n=Safflower Carmine.=—This substance, used by dyers, is a solution of\r\ncarthamine red in soda solution. It is only necessary to add an acid\r\nafter once introducing the fabric in order to fix the colouring matter\r\nat once upon the fibre.\r\n\r\nThe shades produced by carthamine red are distinguished by a delicacy\r\nof tint not produced by other dyes; all shades between the deepest red\r\nand the palest rose-red may be obtained from it. Unfortunately it is\r\nvery susceptible to the action of alkalis; one careless washing of an\r\narticle dyed with carthamine is sufficient to remove the greater part\r\nof the colour.\r\n\r\nOn account of its cost and little durability carthamine red is not\r\nused in painting. It is principally employed in the artificial flower\r\nindustry for colouring flowers. Pure carthamine or a mixture with\r\nfinely powdered steatite is applied by rubbing.\r\n\r\n=Alkanet.=—The roots of alkanet (_Alkanna tinctoria_) contain in the\r\nbark a fine red colouring matter, from which also a violet lake can\r\nbe obtained, though this is rarely made. The plant is largely grown\r\nin Southern Europe and also around Vienna. The colouring matter is\r\nobtained pure by macerating the root for a long time with water and\r\nthen treating with strong alcohol, which dissolves the colouring\r\nmatter, together with a large quantity of resin. The alcohol is\r\ndistilled off, the residue extracted with ether, and the ethereal\r\nextract treated with a large quantity of water, which extracts the\r\ncolouring matter. This is left in the pure state, when the solution is\r\nslowly evaporated.\r\n\r\nAccording to Carnelutti and R. Nasini alkannin is obtained by\r\nextracting the root of _Anchusa tinctoria_ with petroleum ether,\r\nevaporating, treating the residue with weak caustic potash, filtering,\r\nand shaking the filtrate several times with ether. The solvent is\r\nremoved, the colouring matter precipitated by carbonic acid, dried over\r\nsulphuric acid, and dissolved in ether. The filtered solution is then\r\nallowed to evaporate. Alkannin is then obtained as a dark brownish-red\r\nmass, which is easily powdered. It has a metallic lustre, and readily\r\ndissolves in alcohol, glacial acetic acid and chloroform.\r\n\r\nWhen alum is added to the aqueous solution of the colouring matter a\r\nbeautiful violet precipitate separates, which when dry is very suitable\r\nfor artistic purposes. Alkanet is little used. It is completely\r\nreplaced by much cheaper colouring matters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nMADDER AND ITS COLOURING MATTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe root of the madder (_Rubia tinctoria_) contains a red colouring\r\nmatter which is distinguished over all other colours of vegetable\r\norigin by great fastness, on account of which it occupies a most\r\nimportant position in dyeing and colour making. The use of madder in\r\ndyeing has been much restricted by the discovery of artificial methods\r\nof making alizarine, the most important colouring matter of madder.\r\nThus the following account of madder and its products is chiefly of\r\nhistorical interest only.\r\n\r\nMadder is cultivated in many countries. The roots, which vary from the\r\nthickness of a quill to that of a finger, are cleansed from adherent\r\nearth, carefully sorted according to size, and dried. In commerce a\r\ndistinction is made between stripped and unstripped madder. The cortex\r\nof the root contains but little colouring matter and is generally\r\nremoved by mill-stones moving at some distance apart. The stripped\r\nroots are finely ground, and are then known commercially as madder.\r\nMerchants distinguish a large number of varieties, which are designated\r\naccording to the place of production. In addition to ground madder\r\nthere are a number of madder preparations which contain the colouring\r\nmatter in concentrated form, and are consequently used in smaller\r\nquantity. The most important of these preparations are garancin,\r\ngaranceux, and the madder extracts.\r\n\r\n”Refined madder” is made from the natural substance by subjecting it\r\nto a process of fermentation, by which the substances accompanying\r\nthe colouring matters are largely decomposed, and the product becomes\r\nrelatively richer in colouring matter.\r\n\r\n”Flowers of madder,” which have double the colouring power of madder,\r\nare made by treatment with very dilute sulphuric acid. Madder is\r\nstirred with five or six times its quantity of water to which about 1\r\nper cent. of sulphuric acid has been added. After leaving the mixture\r\nin a fairly warm place for five to six days alcoholic fermentation\r\ntakes place, and many substances which would be injurious in dyeing\r\nare decomposed. The residue becomes in consequence richer in colouring\r\nmatter. When the fermentation is finished the residue is filtered\r\noff, subjected to powerful hydraulic pressure, and the mass broken up\r\nand very thoroughly dried at a temperature of 60° to 70° C. If it is\r\nnot thoroughly dried it soon becomes mouldy. This method of treating\r\nmadder, due to Julians, is simple, and has the advantage that from the\r\nalcoholic liquid spirit may be obtained. In some respects this process\r\nis more rational than the one immediately following: certain substances\r\nwhich are destroyed in the manufacture of garancin are made useful, and\r\nalso the process requires little outlay.\r\n\r\n=Garancin= is obtained from madder by treatment with sulphuric acid,\r\nwhich decomposes the glucoside, and also sets free the colouring\r\nmatter united to lime and magnesia, which would otherwise be lost. In\r\naddition, the warm acid radically attacks the nitrogenous compounds,\r\nthe greater portion of which is destroyed. Thus the residue contains\r\nrelatively more colouring matter, and the removal of substances which\r\naccompany the colouring matter considerably facilitates the dyeing\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nAlthough the preparation of garancin was recommended in 1828, it was\r\nmuch later before the prejudice which prevented its general employment\r\nwas completely overcome, and garancin recognised as a very valuable\r\nmaterial for the dyer. The simplest process for preparing garancin is\r\nas follows: Madder is several times washed with water, then pressed,\r\nand the residue mixed with dilute sulphuric acid in a lead-lined\r\nvessel. To 100 parts of madder 50 parts of sulphuric acid and 50\r\nparts of water are taken, the mixture is heated by steam to 100° C.,\r\nand maintained at this temperature for half an hour. By the action\r\nof sulphuric acid of this strength considerable charring occurs, and\r\nin particular the cell walls of the madder are attacked, so that in\r\nthe succeeding process the colouring matter is readily dissolved; in\r\nconsequence of the charring, the garancin acquires a deep brown to\r\nblack colour. When the action of the acid is finished, it is drawn off\r\nand the residue washed with water until it is free from acid, when it\r\nis dried. The process here described is the original method; it has\r\nbeen much modified, hydrochloric acid, zinc chloride, alkalis, soap\r\nsolution, etc., being used in the manufacture of garancin. The colour\r\nmaker will rarely require to make garancin himself, so that it is\r\nsufficient for our purpose to indicate what is understood by garancin,\r\nand in what manner it is made.\r\n\r\n=Garanceux.=—Madder which has been once used in dyeing still retains\r\nsome quantity of colouring matter; this is utilised by treating it by\r\nthe same process which is used to obtain garancin from fresh madder.\r\nThe treatment with sulphuric acid almost entirely destroys the cellular\r\nstructure, so that the residual colouring matter is made accessible to\r\nsolvents, and consequently the garanceux may be again used for dyeing.\r\n\r\n=Madder Extract.=—The fixation of the colouring matter of madder upon\r\nthe fibre is attended with many difficulties; attempts were made to\r\npresent it in the purest form possible, or in such a condition that\r\nthe operation of dyeing was simplified. The commercial madder extracts\r\nconsist either of liquid extracts of madder, or of the more or less\r\npure colouring matter itself. Among the numerous solid or liquid madder\r\nextracts, without doubt the most important is the crude alizarin (the\r\nprincipal colouring matter of madder), made by the process discovered\r\nalmost simultaneously by Rochleder and Pernod. This is produced\r\nby extracting either madder or garancin with hot water containing\r\nsulphuric acid; about 5 grammes of acid are mixed with 1 kilogramme\r\nof water and the madder boiled with this dilute acid in a lead-lined\r\nvessel. The liquid separated from the solid residue becomes turbid on\r\ncooling, and yellow flocks separate which consist of impure alizarin;\r\nno further purification is required for practical purposes. Crude\r\nalizarin is also obtained by treating madder with superheated steam.\r\nThese preparations are important, not only to the dyer and calico\r\nprinter, but also to the colour maker; from them the madder pigments\r\ncan be made in a very simple manner.\r\n\r\n=The Constituents of Madder.=—Madder has been most thoroughly\r\ninvestigated: its colouring matter, alizarin, is now made artificially.\r\nIn addition to woody fibre, madder contains sugar, mucilage, resin, a\r\nglucoside (_i.e._, a substance which can be decomposed into a sugar and\r\nanother substance), and, in particular, two colouring matters known as\r\nalizarin and purpurin.\r\n\r\nAlizarin occurs ready formed in madder, and is also produced by the\r\ndecomposition of the madder glucoside into alizarin and sugar. To\r\nobtain pure alizarin finely ground madder is extracted with boiling\r\nwater; on the addition of sulphuric acid to the decoction alizarin\r\nseparates together with other substances. The moist precipitate is\r\nboiled with a solution of aluminium chloride, and, after filtering,\r\nhydrochloric acid is added to the filtrate, when deep red flocks\r\nseparate, consisting of a mixture of alizarin and purpurin. The\r\ncolouring matters are further purified by dissolving in alcohol and\r\nadding freshly precipitated alumina, which unites with them; the\r\nalumina compounds are then boiled with strong soda solution, in which\r\nthe purpurin dissolves. The residue consists of aluminium alizarinate\r\nmixed with resin, the latter is extracted with ether or benzene, and\r\nthe residue then decomposed with hydrochloric acid, when alizarin is\r\nset free and is purified by recrystallisation.\r\n\r\nAlizarin has the formula C₁₄H₆O₂(OH)₂. It forms fine red crystals\r\nwhich are very little soluble in cold but more easily in hot water;\r\nthey dissolve readily in strong alcohol to a yellow solution. Alizarin\r\ndissolves in alkaline liquids, the solution is dichroic; it appears\r\ndark purple by transmitted light and pure blue by reflected light. When\r\nthe alkaline solution of alizarin is brought in contact with freshly\r\nprecipitated alumina the colouring matter is completely thrown down and\r\na beautiful red lake is formed.\r\n\r\nThe second madder colouring matter is purpurin. This is more soluble in\r\nwater than alizarin, it also dissolves in alum solutions; its alkaline\r\nsolutions are not dichroic. The formula of purpurin is C₁₄H₅O₂(OH)₃.\r\nIn addition to these two colouring matters, madder contains a third,\r\nknown as rubiacin, which also forms red compounds. It appears to be\r\nfixed upon fabrics dyed with madder in company with the other colouring\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nDyeing and printing with the colouring matters of madder are among the\r\nmost difficult processes in dyeing; a long series of operations is\r\nrequired to fix the colour permanently on the fabric. The beautiful\r\ndeep red colour known as Turkey red is produced by madder; it is\r\ndistinguished from other vegetable colours by its great fastness. By\r\nmeans of madder various other shades besides pure red may be produced.\r\nThis very valuable substance is largely used in dyeing and calico\r\nprinting to produce permanent colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nMADDER LAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe madder lakes are equally as permanent as the madder colouring\r\nmatters dyed upon fabrics. On this account and because of their\r\nhandsome colour they are highly prized by painters. The best qualities\r\nof madder are necessary to produce fine lakes; it is more convenient\r\nto use garancin or madder extract. Only when the colouring matter is\r\ntolerably free from the foreign substances which accompany it can\r\na pure red madder lake be produced; the poorer qualities of madder\r\nproduce a lake which is not a pure red and is never bright. The good\r\nrepute of the madder lakes of certain makers is in great part due\r\nto careful choice of the raw materials. This choice and care in the\r\nprocess are the secrets of the manufacturers who produce good madder\r\nlakes.\r\n\r\nThe author has found that the finest lakes can be obtained without\r\ndifficulty from the alizarin, separated in the before-mentioned manner\r\nfrom madder by means of sulphuric acid. The small cost of obtaining\r\ncrude alizarin by this process enables it to be used on a commercial\r\nscale. The labour involved in the process is far outweighed by the\r\nexcellent qualities of the lakes produced.\r\n\r\nA very bright lake is obtained directly from madder by treating with\r\nsulphuric acid (thus garancin is really used), digesting the mass\r\nfor several hours with a solution of alum absolutely free from iron,\r\nfiltering and adding at first a small quantity of soda solution; a\r\nlittle madder lake is precipitated which is of the finest shade.\r\nWhen this lake has settled the liquid is poured off and again mixed\r\nwith a little soda solution. The lake now precipitated is inferior\r\nto the first, if the madder is not of specially fine quality. By\r\nthis fractional precipitation of the colouring matter, madder lakes\r\nvarying in beauty are produced; the separate fractions often differ\r\nconsiderably in shade, this is because the later portions are more and\r\nmore contaminated by the foreign substances contained in the madder.\r\n\r\nFrom inferior madder lake, which could only be sold at a low price,\r\na lake of the best quality can be produced in the following manner:\r\nThe lake is finely powdered, mixed with acetic acid and left to stand\r\ntwenty-four hours; the madder lake dissolves in the acid to a fine red\r\nsolution, whilst the impurities remain on the filter when the solution\r\nis filtered. The clear solution is mixed with a large volume of water\r\nfree from lime, and the acetic acid neutralised by soda, when pure\r\nmadder lake separates. The addition of soda is not continued until all\r\nthe lake is precipitated, but only until the liquid is still slightly\r\nred. Hydrochloric acid may be used instead of acetic; it is much\r\ncheaper, but must be absolutely free from iron.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the crude alizarin prepared as\r\ndescribed above is well suited as a source of madder lake, since it is\r\nfree from the majority of the substances which injure the purity of\r\nthe shade. It is treated with a boiling solution of alum and filtered\r\nwhilst hot; madder lake is then precipitated by cautious additions of\r\nsoda, the first portions precipitated being the best.\r\n\r\n=Madder Carmine= is not often found in commerce; it consists of the\r\nalmost pure lakes of alizarin and purpurin. The process by which\r\nthis valuable pigment is produced is based upon the great stability\r\nof the madder colouring matters. The following is the process on the\r\nlarge scale: Good madder, very finely ground, is spread out in small\r\nheaps in a room, the temperature of which is about 16° to 18° C.; the\r\nheaps are moistened with water and left for several days. The mass\r\nferments and gives off a peculiar smell; in the fermentation not only\r\nis the glucoside decomposed, but also many of the other compounds\r\ncontained in the madder, consequently the mass becomes dark and\r\nconsiderably diminishes in weight. The end of the fermentation process\r\nmay be recognised by a little practice with tolerable certainty by\r\nthe disappearance of the peculiar smell; the mass is broken up and\r\ntransferred to a lead-lined vessel, in which it is mixed with three or\r\nfour times its weight of ordinary sulphuric acid. The acid is allowed\r\nto act for several hours, the plant fibres are almost completely\r\ncharred, and the mixture becomes black. When the charred residue has\r\nsettled, the liquid is filtered through pure quartz sand or powdered\r\nglass, and mixed with a large quantity of water. The carmine, which is\r\ninsoluble in water, separates as a red powder; it is then washed and\r\ndried.\r\n\r\nThe colour of madder carmine is of such beauty that it can only be\r\ncompared with that of good cochineal carmine, but it is incomparably\r\nmore permanent than the latter and may be used in all varieties of\r\npainting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nMANJIT (INDIAN MADDER).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe roots of the East Indian _Rubia mungista_ contain purpurin and\r\nanother characteristic colouring matter, manjistin. This material is\r\na rarity in German commerce, but is imported into England from India\r\nin tolerable amount and used in dyeing. Manjistin may be extracted\r\nby boiling manjit repeatedly with a solution of aluminium sulphate,\r\nuniting the liquids and acidifying strongly with hydrochloric acid. In\r\ntwenty-four hours a red precipitate forms in the liquid; it is dried\r\nand treated with boiling carbon disulphide, which extracts purpurin\r\nand manjistin and leaves undissolved a dark resin. The residue, after\r\ndistilling off the carbon bisulphide, gives up purpurin to dilute\r\nacetic acid, manjistin remaining undissolved. When the purpurin has\r\nbeen completely extracted, the residue is treated with a little boiling\r\nalcohol and repeatedly recrystallised; manjistin is finally obtained in\r\ngolden yellow crystals of the composition C₁₄H₁₅O₂(OH)₂.CO₂H.\r\n\r\nWhen a solution of manjistin in a little alcohol is mixed with water no\r\nprecipitate occurs; on then adding aluminium hydrate and long boiling\r\nan orange red lake is produced. Lead acetate produces a deep orange red\r\nlake when used in just sufficient quantity; with excess a fine scarlet\r\nlake is obtained.\r\n\r\nIf manjit were a common article in the German market, it would be used\r\nin the preparation of fine pigments with as much advantage as madder\r\nand the various madder preparations.\r\n\r\n=Chica Red, Curucuru, Carajuru.=—The colouring matter known under\r\nthese names rarely comes into commerce; it forms brownish-red masses\r\nwhich acquire a peculiar golden glitter on rubbing. It is obtained\r\nfrom the leaves of _Bignonia chica_, a native of tropical America. The\r\nleaves are superficially dried and then covered with water; in the\r\nwarm climate the macerated leaves soon ferment, and a deep red powder\r\nseparates at the bottom of the vessel: this is the colouring matter; it\r\nis dried, made into small cakes and brought into the market.\r\n\r\nChica red is only partially soluble in strong alcohol, the residue\r\nchiefly consists of plant cells. Alum and stannous chloride precipitate\r\nbeautiful red lakes from the solution, which are distinguished by great\r\npermanence when exposed to light. On account of the present high price,\r\nthis colouring matter has not yet obtained admission into the colour\r\nindustries, though it would be a valuable recruit.\r\n\r\nChica red has been little studied; an investigation would certainly\r\nconsiderably increase our knowledge of the organic colouring matters.\r\nTowards reducing agents it behaves in a similar manner to indigo; in\r\ncontact with caustic soda, grape sugar and water in closed flasks, a\r\nviolet liquid is produced; when exposed in an open vessel the violet at\r\nonce changes to brown, but if the liquid is syphoned off into dilute\r\nhydrochloric acid a pure red precipitate separates, which is to be\r\nregarded as the pure colouring matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nLICHEN COLOURING MATTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany lichens contain compounds from which colouring matters can be\r\nobtained by appropriate treatment; the colouring matters known as\r\ncudbear, archil and litmus were formerly much more extensively used in\r\ndyeing than at present: like so many natural colouring matters they\r\nhave been replaced by coal-tar dyes.\r\n\r\nThe lichens which produce colouring matters live upon trees and rocks,\r\nchiefly on the sea-shore; the colouring matters are thus generally\r\nmanufactured in places near the coast. The species principally used for\r\nthis purpose are _Lecanora_, _Rocella_ and _Usnea_.\r\n\r\nThe lichens contain colourless compounds, which by treatment with acid\r\nor alkalis produce orcinol. In contact with moist air and ammonia,\r\norcinol is decomposed into water and orcein, which is the colouring\r\nmatter. The lichens are treated so as to produce the largest quantity\r\nof orcinol, which is then converted into orcein. There is not space\r\nhere to enumerate and describe the many compounds obtained from\r\nlichens, only the most important can be mentioned; these are erythric,\r\nlecanoric and usnic acids. Lecanoric acid produces, under certain\r\nconditions, orsellic acid, which is again changed to orcinol.\r\n\r\nPure orcinol, C₇H₈O₂. H₂O, is a crystalline substance of sweet taste;\r\nit is soluble in ether, alcohol, water, etc. In damp air containing\r\nammonia, orcinol gradually acquires a fine red colour, being converted\r\ninto orcein, C₇H₇NO₃, according to the following reaction:—\r\n\r\n    C₇H₈O₂ + NH₃ + 3O = C₇H₇NO₃ + 2H₂O.\r\n\r\nWhen pure, orcein is a brownish-red amorphous powder, soluble in\r\nalcohol to a scarlet solution and in alkalis to a purple solution. On\r\nthe addition of water to the ammoniacal solution or of salt to the\r\nalkaline solution, orcein is again separated; this procedure may be\r\nused to completely purify the colouring matter.\r\n\r\n=Archil= is principally obtained from the lichens _Lecanora_ and\r\n_Rocella_. These lichens have a wide geographical distribution; archil\r\nis made in Sweden, Italy and Spain. It is obtained in a simple manner:\r\nthe powdered lichen is mixed with decomposing urine to a paste, which\r\nis allowed to lie in the air until the colour has changed through\r\nred to violet; on the average fourteen days are required for the\r\ntransformation. More recently the process has been made less disgusting\r\nby replacing urine by ammoniacal gas liquor. When the mixture is violet\r\nall through the process is finished; the wet mass is packed into\r\nbarrels, which are well closed to prevent it from drying.\r\n\r\nThe presence of alkalis accelerates the formation of orcein; in many\r\ndistricts it is customary to add a little lime to the mixture of lichen\r\nand urine; alum is also added to retard putrefaction, which readily\r\noccurs in warm climates.\r\n\r\nInstead of using lichens to produce the colouring matter, they may be\r\nextracted by boiling water, the solution considerably evaporated and\r\nthen exposed to the air with the addition of ammonia, until the violet\r\ncolouration appears. Slight additions of sulphuric acid give a more\r\npurple tint; soda produces a deeper violet.\r\n\r\n=French Purple= is a compound of the archil colouring matter with\r\nlime, _i.e._, a lime lake. This beautiful substance is obtained by\r\ntreating the lichen for some minutes with ammonia, pressing out\r\nthe liquid and neutralising it exactly with hydrochloric acid. The\r\nprecipitate obtained consists of the lichen acids; it is again\r\ndissolved in ammonia and the solution exposed to the air until it has\r\nbecome cherry red. When this is the case the liquid is quickly boiled\r\nand placed in large shallow dishes, which are kept at a temperature\r\nof 75° C. until the colour is purple-violet. Calcium chloride is then\r\nadded; a garnet red precipitate is produced, which, when washed and\r\ndried, constitutes French purple.\r\n\r\nArchil and French purple produce shades of great beauty and purity,\r\nbut they have little durability and are quickly altered by exposure to\r\nlight. They are, therefore, seldom used as pigments. The same is the\r\ncase with cudbear and litmus.\r\n\r\n=Cudbear= is a dirty purple powder with an ammoniacal odour and salt\r\ntaste. It is made on a large scale in Holland. It differs from archil\r\nonly in containing the colouring matter in the solid form.\r\n\r\n=Litmus= is generally made from lichens of the genus _Variolaria_,\r\nthough varieties of _Rocella_ and _Lecanora_ are often used. It is not\r\nmade in quite the same manner as archil and cudbear. Together with the\r\nammonia, potash is added to the powdered lichen. The mixture is left\r\nuntil it has become violet, when urine, potash and lime are added at\r\nintervals to continue the decomposition until the colour is changed to\r\nblue and the whole mass has become a paste. Gypsum and lime are then\r\nadded, the mixture formed into rectangular plates, and brought into the\r\nmarket, described by a number, according to the amount of gypsum added.\r\n\r\nPure litmus should leave little solid residue when dissolved in water,\r\nthe solution should be a fine violet. On account of its want of\r\nstability this colouring matter is not used in dyeing. It can be used\r\nfor colouring foods since it is innocuous; but indigo carmine has much\r\ngreater colouring power and at the same time gives fine shades.\r\n\r\nThe only use of litmus at the present time is as an indicator to decide\r\nwhether a solution is acid, neutral or alkaline. In a quite neutral\r\nsolution litmus is violet. Acids turn the solution to red and alkalis\r\nto pure blue. In preparing litmus tincture regard must be given to\r\nthe fact that the aqueous solution of the colouring matter is always\r\nalkaline; acid must be cautiously added until the colour is violet, and\r\nthe least addition of acid or alkali suffices to change it to red or\r\nblue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nRED WOOD LAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nRed wood is obtained from species of _Cæsalpinia_ growing in South\r\nAmerica. The following varieties are distinguished: Fernambuco or\r\nBrazil wood, Bahia wood, St. Martha wood, Lima wood and Sapan wood,\r\nall of which contain the same colouring matter, but in different\r\nquantities. Red wood comes into commerce either as thick logs of a fine\r\nred colour or as finely-rasped chips. Fernambuco and Sapan woods are\r\naccounted the best varieties. Although the colouring matters contained\r\nin these woods have been investigated for a long time, an accurate\r\nknowledge of them has only recently been obtained. The pure colouring\r\nmatter of red wood, brasilin, forms orange-coloured needle-shaped\r\ncrystals, soluble in water, alcohol and ether. On careful heating it\r\npartially sublimes undecomposed. Brasilin most probably results from\r\nthe alteration of a substance contained in the inner less coloured\r\nportion of the wood; this compound, brasileïn, has been obtained in\r\ncolourless needles; its solution acquires a red colour on boiling, and\r\nproduces the pure colouring matter.\r\n\r\nBrasilin is a weak acid of the composition C₁₆H₁₄O₅. It forms\r\nhandsomely coloured compounds with most metallic oxides, which are\r\nmuch used in dyeing. A decoction of red wood gives with alum and\r\nsoda solution a handsome lake of a pure red colour. With a solution\r\nof stannic chloride it at once produces a red precipitate. When a\r\nsolution of potassium chromate is added to a decoction of redwood, a\r\ndark brown precipitate separates, which is a compound of chromium oxide\r\nwith the partially altered colouring matter. The decoction produces a\r\nbrownish red compound with ferric oxide.\r\n\r\nThe decoctions of red wood contain, in addition to the colouring\r\nmatter, a number of other substances which would injure the shade of\r\nthe lake obtained from the decoction. The greater portion of these\r\nsubstances may be separated by allowing the decoction to stand for\r\nseveral days, when a dirty reddish brown mud forms at the bottom of\r\nthe vessel. This simple method of purification is attended with the\r\ndisadvantage that, especially in summer, the decoction rapidly becomes\r\nmouldy. This may be prevented by the addition of a little carbolic\r\nacid; not more than 0·01 per cent. of the quantity of liquid is\r\nrequired. The foreign matters may also be separated by adding milk or a\r\nsolution of glue to the decoction, but the simpler process of allowing\r\nit to stand gives the best result.\r\n\r\nFrom the behaviour of brasilin towards the metallic oxides, as given\r\nabove, it follows that compounds of different colours can be made from\r\nred wood. These are utilised in dyeing, but in colour works red wood\r\nis only used for the preparation of red lakes. The lakes are found in\r\ncommerce under numerous names, the most common of which are Venetian\r\nlake, Vienna lake, Florentine lake, Berlin lake, etc. According as\r\nthe colouring matter is combined with alumina alone or with stannic\r\nchloride in addition, pale or deep lakes are obtained. The different\r\nshades of red wood lakes found in commerce are obtained by additions of\r\na white pigment. For this purpose levigated chalk, gypsum, lycopodium\r\npowder, and other white pigments light in weight are used.\r\n\r\nIn preparing red wood lakes the decoction should always be purified by\r\nthe process mentioned above; there is then more certainty of obtaining\r\na bright lake. It is advisable to dilute the decoction considerably\r\nwith pure water before precipitating the lake; experience has shown\r\nthat brighter colours are thus obtained. To 100 parts of wood 130 to\r\n150 parts of alum are used. The latter is dissolved alone and mixed\r\nwith the decoction, the lake is then precipitated by soda solution. As\r\nthe lake separates the liquid becomes lighter; portions should be taken\r\nout of the vessel in order to see when all the colouring matter is\r\nthrown down. If too much soda solution is added the lake takes a violet\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nA particularly fine lake is obtained from Fernambuco wood when the\r\nextract is acidified with a weak acid, such as acetic, and stannic\r\nchloride used together with alum in precipitating the lake. One hundred\r\nparts of rasped wood are boiled with 300 parts of water to which acetic\r\nacid has been added; the extract is then boiled with 130 parts of alum\r\nuntil the latter is dissolved. To the filtered liquid 20 to 25 parts\r\nof stannic chloride are added whilst stirring well, and the lake is at\r\nonce precipitated by soda solution.\r\n\r\nIf the lake from Fernambuco wood does not turn out well, a better\r\nproduct may be obtained by treating the lake with such a quantity of\r\nhydrochloric acid that a small portion remains undecomposed. This is\r\nfiltered off, and the colouring matter reprecipitated in combination\r\nwith alumina by neutralising with soda solution.\r\n\r\nBy adding a little Dutch pink more orange shades of the Fernambuco lake\r\nare obtained. In this manner any intermediate shade between pure red\r\nand pure yellow can be produced. It is important to lay down a standard\r\nseries of shades, and always to make pigments which exactly correspond\r\nwith one of them. It is not possible to make a determined shade of\r\nred wood lake or any other lake obtained from a decoction by working\r\nwith accurately weighed quantities. In general the result will be near\r\nthe desired shade, but only by chance will it be hit exactly. This is\r\nbecause different samples of the dye-wood do not always contain the\r\nsame quantity of colouring matter. It is indeed possible with practice\r\nto estimate approximately from the colour of the decoction the shade\r\nof the lake which will be obtained from it; but this can only be done\r\nexactly by comparing the shade of a small batch of the lake with the\r\nstandard shades. Thus in the case of a Fernambuco lake it will be seen\r\nby comparison with the standard shades whether the colour of the small\r\nbatch is too deep, too violet, etc.; then by using more alum or more\r\ntin solution the defects can be removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nTHE COLOURING MATTERS OF SANDALWOOD AND OTHER DYE-WOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the dye-woods in more common use, the tropics furnish\r\na number of woods which contain fine colouring matters, but which are\r\nonly in restricted use, either on account of their cost or because they\r\nare not always to be bought. To these belong the camwood or barwood of\r\nMadagascar, the East Indian sandalwood, and other woods which have not\r\nyet been used for colouring purposes even in the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used of the rarer dye-woods is sandalwood, obtained\r\nfrom _Pterocarpus santalinus_. It is garnet red in colour, sinks in\r\nwater, and produces a fine red meal, which rapidly becomes brown in\r\nair owing to oxidation of the colouring matter. According to recent\r\nresearches, sandalwood contains two colouring matters, one obtained\r\nfrom the other by oxidation. Only one of these, santalin, is known\r\nwith certainty. Sandalwood contains about 16 per cent. of santalin,\r\nwhich when pure forms a crystalline powder, differing from other\r\nwood colouring matters in being almost insoluble in water. Up to the\r\npresent it has only been used in dyeing to obtain handsome and fast red\r\ncolours. From it very bright lakes may be obtained, which may be used\r\nequally as well as the red wood lakes. The aluminium and tin lakes are\r\nespecially fine. The extract of sandalwood is obtained by boiling very\r\nfine chips with water, then adding alcohol and leaving the mixture.\r\nWhen stannic chloride or alum, or a mixture of the two, is added to the\r\nsolution of the colouring matter a red precipitate is produced which,\r\nafter washing and drying, furnishes a bright red lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nBLUE LAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Indigo.=—The colouring matter of the indigo plant is distinguished by\r\ngreat resistance to the action of light, air, and chemical reagents.\r\nIt is thus often cited as a particular example of a fast and durable\r\ncolour. It is very largely used in dyeing, and in certain combinations\r\nis important as a painters’ colour.\r\n\r\nIndigo comes into commerce in a great variety of qualities, all\r\nimported from the tropics, in which alone the plant grows. The\r\nprincipal varieties are Indian, Java, Egyptian, American and African,\r\nbut in these merchants make numerous subdivisions which are often to\r\nbe distinguished from one another only by very small differences. Good\r\nindigo, whatever its source, has the following characteristics: It\r\nappears in almost cubical lumps, but may also form irregular masses.\r\nThe lumps must show a small specific gravity, a higher might be caused\r\nby intentional additions of sand or earth. It is without taste and\r\nsmell, and the colour of the finest varieties is not particularly\r\nbright, but when rubbed with a hard substance, or even by the pressure\r\nof the finger nail, it acquires a peculiar coppery lustre, which is the\r\nmore intense the purer the indigo, and is thus regarded as a common\r\ntest of quality. Indigo is completely insoluble in almost all solvents;\r\nin hot oils a small quantity dissolves, which again separates on\r\ncooling. The following are the principal signs by which the quality\r\nof indigo is recognised in commerce: It forms a dull-coloured, loose,\r\nlight mass of earthy nature, a fresh fracture of which has a completely\r\nuniform appearance. It must be so porous that it at once adheres to the\r\ntongue. Uniformity of colour, light weight and fine fracture are the\r\nmost important of the practical tests for good indigo. The composition\r\nof indigo is well known; we shall glance rapidly over the most\r\nimportant substances which occur in indigo in varying quantity.\r\n\r\n=The Constituents of Indigo.=—Indigo contains the following compounds:\r\nIndigo blue, indigo red, indigo brown, indigo gluten, water and salts.\r\nThe single important constituent for the purposes of the colour maker\r\nis indigo blue, or indigotin.\r\n\r\nPure indigo blue can be obtained from indigo only by a lengthy\r\nprocess. The indigo is boiled in turn with dilute sulphuric acid,\r\ncaustic potash, and strong alcohol. The gluten dissolves in the acid,\r\nthe indigo brown in the potash solution, and the indigo red in the\r\nalcohol. By these operations indigo blue is finally obtained in a state\r\nof almost complete purity, it now contains only a small quantity of\r\ninorganic substances. The quantity of pure indigo blue obtained in this\r\nmanner varies, according to the purity of the indigo employed, from 20\r\nto 75 per cent. Indigo blue can also be obtained by direct sublimation\r\nfrom indigo, but the yield is very small, since a large proportion is\r\ndecomposed by dry distillation.\r\n\r\nThe most important constituent of indigo, indigo blue, can be obtained\r\nin quite pure form by a peculiar chemical process. When finely powdered\r\nindigo is brought in contact with a reducing agent in the presence\r\nof a strong alkali, the indigo blue is converted into indigo white,\r\nwhich forms a soluble compound with the alkali, which compound is\r\nstable only so long as it is protected from the action of the air. In\r\ncontact with air indigo white is at once oxidised, and is reconverted\r\ninto indigo blue, which separates from the liquid as a soft deep blue\r\npowder; after washing and drying it is quite pure. Whilst sublimed\r\nindigo blue forms needles with a splendid coppery lustre, when\r\nprecipitated from a solution of indigo white by the action of oxygen it\r\nis obtained as an amorphous powder, which acquires the coppery lustre\r\nonly when rubbed.\r\n\r\nThe process of the reduction of indigo blue by a reducing agent in the\r\npresence of a strong base is not only of theoretical interest, but is\r\nlargely used in practice. Fabrics are generally dyed with indigo by\r\nimmersing them in a solution of indigo white (known as the indigo vat),\r\nand then exposing them to the air. The oxidation of the indigo white\r\nthen takes place on the fibre, upon which the indigo is deposited in a\r\nvery finely divided form; the blue colour is not immediately formed,\r\nthere is an intermediate green stage.\r\n\r\nIndigo is used principally in dyeing. Certain of its compounds are\r\nused as pigments; the starting point in the preparation of these is a\r\ncompound of indigo blue with sulphuric acid. When indigo is treated\r\nwith sulphuric acid, according to the duration of the reaction and the\r\ntemperature at which it is performed, either the monosulphonic acid\r\nor disulphonic acid is formed. The reactions proceed according to the\r\nfollowing equations:—\r\n\r\n     C₁₆H₁₀N₂O₂ + H₂SO₄ = H₂O + C₁₆H₉N₂O₂.HSO₃\r\n    C₁₆H₁₀N₂O₂ + 2H₂SO₄ = 2H₂O + C₁₆H₈N₂O₂.(HSO₃)₂\r\n\r\nWhen indigo is treated with eight times its weight of strong sulphuric\r\nacid, and the solution considerably diluted, indigotin monosulphonic\r\nacid separates as a fine blue precipitate, which dissolves with\r\ndifficulty in water and alcohol, and is insoluble in dilute acids. In\r\norder to obtain the disulphonic acid 1 part of indigo is digested with\r\n15 partsof sulphuric acid at 50° to 60° C. for several days. If fuming\r\nsulphuric acid be used the solution is effected in a shorter time.\r\nThe solution is diluted with a large quantity of water, when a little\r\nmonosulphonic acid separates; the clear solution is drawn off and a\r\npiece of wool immersed in it. The sulphonic acid is soon fixed by the\r\nanimal fibre; the wool is washed with water and then treated with a\r\nsolution of ammonium carbonate, when a deep blue solution of ammonium\r\nindigotin disulphonate is produced. This solution is evaporated at a\r\nlow temperature and treated with strong alcohol, which leaves a residue\r\nof the pure disulphonate, which is dissolved in water, the solution\r\nprecipitated with lead acetate and the lead indigotin disulphonate\r\ntreated with sulphuretted hydrogen. The colourless solution becomes\r\nblue on evaporation; finally pure indigotin disulphonic acid is left as\r\nan amorphous deliquescent mass. The solution became colourless owing to\r\nthe reducing action of the sulphuretted hydrogen; when this was driven\r\noff by heating the blue colour reappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI.\r\n\r\nINDIGO CARMINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndigo carmine is used in the laundry, for blue inks and as an artists’\r\npigment; in chemical composition it is a mixture of the sodium salts\r\nof the two indigotin sulphonic acids described in the last chapter.\r\nIn working on the large scale it is particularly important that the\r\nindigo should be finely powdered and completely free from moisture. It\r\nis a laborious process to powder indigo in mortars, and loss always\r\noccurs through the formation of dust. Thus when large quantities of\r\nindigo are to be powdered it is advisable to use rotating cylinders.\r\nThese are strong casks bound with iron hoops and provided with a\r\nwell-fitting slide, through which the indigo and a number of iron balls\r\nare introduced. When these casks are rotated for a sufficient length of\r\ntime the indigo is converted into the finest powder without any loss.\r\n\r\n=Indigo Mills.=—Special mills have been designed for powdering indigo.\r\nThey may be advantageously employed for other materials also. The\r\nconstruction of a well-designed colour mill is represented in Fig. 36,\r\nin which indigo may be very finely powdered without loss. It consists\r\nof a cast-iron pan, which can be closed by a well-fitting cover.\r\nThrough the cover passes the axis of the rotating part, which is moved\r\nby the bevel cog-wheels and the handle. Above the cog-wheel fastened\r\nto the axis is a cross piece carrying heavy balls at the ends, which\r\nserve to keep the motion regular. In the interior of the pan four\r\nvertical rods are attached to the axis; these are placed at such a\r\ndistance that they drive before them the heavy balls in the circular\r\ndepression of the pan. The action of this apparatus is very simple.\r\nAfter the introduction of the indigo through an opening in the cover\r\nthe axis is put in rotation, the vertical rods attached to the axis\r\nroll the balls before them, and thus break up the lumps of indigo. The\r\nlarger pieces of indigo oppose considerable resistance to the rotation,\r\nwhich should at first be slow. When the lumps have been broken down the\r\nspeed of rotation can be considerably increased. After the operation\r\nhas been continued for a sufficient length of time the indigo is\r\nconverted into an impalpable powder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.]\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the removal of the ground indigo, an arm carrying a brush\r\nof fine hair should be attached to the horizontal arm of the axis.\r\nIf this brush is placed so that it sweeps the bottom of the circular\r\ndepression in which the balls move, all the indigo powder in this\r\ndepression will be carried in one direction. In the depression is an\r\nopening closed by a slide during the grinding. The brush expels the\r\nground indigo through this opening when the axis is slowly rotated;\r\nit is collected in a vessel below. The larger and heavier are the\r\nballs in this mill, the more rapidly will a given quantity of indigo\r\nbe powdered, and the greater will be the power required to drive the\r\nmachine. By means of a pulley on the axis of the cog-wheel the mill can\r\nbe driven by mechanical power.\r\n\r\nThe powdered indigo is exposed for a long time to a temperature of 120°\r\nC., to completely dry it. For this purpose it is spread out on sheets\r\nof tin plate in a thin layer and heated so long as a test portion\r\ndecreases in weight. The powder whilst still warm is at once mixed with\r\nthe sulphuric acid; 4·5 kilogrammes of fuming sulphuric acid and 1\r\nkilogramme of ordinary sulphuric acid (66° Bé) are used to 1 kilogramme\r\nof indigo. Heat is developed in the operation, and in order to prevent\r\nthe indigo from being charred the vessel in which the mixture is made\r\nis placed in a larger vessel filled with cold water. The mixture is\r\nstirred with a glass spatula until it is quite uniform. The vessel\r\nis then maintained at a temperature of about 50° C. (not more than\r\n60° C.) for 7 to 8 days. After the lapse of this time the indigo is\r\ncompletely dissolved, and the vessel is found to contain two distinct\r\nlayers, the upper fluid and the lower a paste. The contents are mixed\r\nwith cold water, about 10 kilogrammes of water to 1 kilogramme of\r\nindigo. A solution of 10 kilogrammes of common salt is then added in\r\nsmall quantities at a time. Indigo carmine is insoluble in strong salt\r\nsolutions; it separates as a deep blue precipitate, which is allowed\r\nto settle and then filtered. If it were attempted to wash out the\r\nremainder of the salt solution retained by the carmine, a considerable\r\nquantity of the latter would dissolve as soon as the salt solution\r\nbecame diluted to a certain extent. To avoid such loss the precipitate\r\nis allowed to drain completely on the filter, and then spread out upon\r\nbricks, which absorb the water, so that the carmine forms a stiff\r\npaste.\r\n\r\nIndigo carmine, from which the salt has not been completely washed out,\r\ndries completely when exposed to the air. This may be prevented by the\r\naddition of glycerine, which is a very hygroscopic substance, and so\r\nkeeps the carmine always moist, thus preventing the crystallisation of\r\nthe salt.\r\n\r\nIndigo carmine easily dissolves in water to a deep blue liquid. It\r\nhas tremendous colouring power, in which respect it is only equalled\r\nby genuine cochineal carmine. As mentioned above, indigo carmine is\r\nextensively employed in the manufacture of ink. The so-called alizarin\r\ninks show a very pale colour as they flow from the pen, and only become\r\ndeep black after some time. To make these inks equally visible at the\r\nfirst indigo carmine is added, by which they acquire a handsome blue\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nIndigo carmine may also be made by digesting 1 part of dry powdered\r\nindigo for 24 to 36 hours with 4 parts of strong sulphuric acid,\r\ndiluting with water, quickly filtering through a linen cloth, and\r\nadding 4 parts of common salt. The precipitate is then collected and\r\ndried on gypsum or clay plates.\r\n\r\n=Blue Lake.=—When alum is added to a solution of indigo sulphonic acid,\r\nand then soda solution, a blue precipitate is formed, which, when dry,\r\nresembles Chinese blue in appearance. It is used in painting. This\r\nindigo blue lake is superior to other blue lakes by reason of its\r\nfastness to light. It is rather dear, and is mixed with starch, so that\r\nit may be sold at low prices; the mixture is formed into slabs and sold\r\nas ”new blue,” ”indigo extract,” etc. It is chiefly used in the laundry.\r\n\r\nUnder various names a number of blue pigments are sold consisting of\r\nordinary qualities of indigo mixed with Prussian blue, smalts, chalk,\r\netc. These are used in the laundry, and also for distempering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nTHE COLOURING MATTER OF LOGWOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wood of _Hæmatoxylon campechianum_ (logwood), a native of South\r\nAmerica, comes into the market in small logs of a red colour; it\r\ncontains a colouring matter whose properties are fairly well known.\r\nBefore the discovery of the coal-tar dyes logwood was a most important\r\ncolouring material; by means of it red, blue, violet and black colours\r\ncan be obtained. At present it still plays an important part in dyeing.\r\n\r\nMany varieties of logwood come into commerce. The most important are\r\nCampeachy wood, Honduras, Jamaica and St. Domingo logwood; the first\r\nnamed is the best, and the last the poorest quality. To facilitate\r\nthe extraction of the colouring matter by water logwood is frequently\r\nsold in chips. Many dye-wood grinders moisten logwood with lime water;\r\nthis gives the powder a better colour, but diminishes the yield of\r\ncolouring matter. Since the only useful constituent of logwood can be\r\nextracted by treatment with water, and the wood is only a carrier of\r\nthe colouring matter, which is only useful for fuel when exhausted,\r\nlogwood extracts are largely used in place of the wood. The extracts\r\nare black resin-like masses, which easily dissolve in water; they are\r\nvery hygroscopic, and should therefore be kept in closed vessels.\r\n\r\n=Logwood Extract.=—Solid extracts can be obtained from the majority of\r\ndye-woods. The use of these is a great convenience to the dyer and\r\nthe colour maker; the method by which extracts are made is therefore\r\nbriefly described.\r\n\r\nDye-wood extracts can be made on the small scale, by washing out the\r\nfinely divided wood until soluble matters are no longer taken up by\r\nthe water, and cautiously evaporating the united extracts. When the\r\nextract becomes concentrated the greatest care must be taken to prevent\r\nburning on the bottom of the vessel; a burnt extract is always darkened\r\nby the presence of products of decomposition, and its solution has a\r\nbrown colour. Apart from this, the complete extraction of the colouring\r\nmatter requires much time, and such dilute solutions are produced that\r\nthey cannot be evaporated, but at the best can be used in the place of\r\nwater to extract fresh quantities of wood.\r\n\r\nWhen steam is utilised to extract dye-woods these defects are\r\nremoved. A burnt extract is not to be feared, and a small quantity of\r\nwater is sufficient to extract the colouring matter completely. The\r\napparatus illustrated in Fig. 37 is very suitable for the extraction\r\nof dye-woods, and in general for obtaining vegetable extracts. The\r\nextraction vessel is pear-shaped, its two hollow axes move in hollow\r\nbearings. Thus it may be turned upside down, and steam and water can be\r\nintroduced into the interior through the axes, which are connected with\r\nthe pipes, E, W, and R. The opening at the pointed end of the pear is\r\nclosed by the screw, S; through it the substances to be extracted are\r\nintroduced. In the lower portion of the vessel is a sieve upon which\r\nthe materials are spread out. The opening of the pipe connected with E\r\nand W is below the sieve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.]\r\n\r\nThe process is commenced by introducing the materials through the\r\nupper opening, fastening the cover down steam-tight by the lever,\r\nB, and the screw, S, and then running in water through W until it\r\nflows out through the lower of the two narrow pipes which are shown\r\nsomewhat paler in the shaded portion of the drawing. All the taps are\r\nthen closed with the exception of that on the upper of the two small\r\npipes. By opening the cock on R steam is led in. As a rule, steam at a\r\nlow pressure is used, not more than half an atmosphere. The contents\r\nbegin to boil in 15 to 30 minutes, steam then issues from the open\r\ntap. According to the nature of the material to be extracted, boiling\r\nis continued from 40 to 60 minutes. The side tap is then closed, and\r\nthe tap on the pipe E opened. The pressure of the steam now forces the\r\nliquid up the pipe E; the pressure of half an atmosphere is sufficient\r\nto raise it about 4 metres. In this way it can be forced into a tank\r\nabove. The rest of the liquid can be run off through the cock, _h_,\r\nat the bottom of the vessel. When quite empty the cover is taken off,\r\nthe vessel turned over, and the solid residue removed. One extraction\r\nof dye-woods is not sufficient to remove the whole of the colouring\r\nmatter; in most cases the wood is treated a second time before the\r\napparatus is emptied. Even then some quantity of colouring matter\r\nremains in the wood. The twice extracted wood is brought into a tub\r\nfilled with water, and the solution resulting from the long contact\r\nof the water with the wood is used in the next operation to extract\r\nnew quantities of wood instead of fresh water. The dimensions of the\r\nextraction vessel vary according to the size of the works. A large\r\napparatus costs not much more than a smaller, since in both cases the\r\nlabour is the same, so that it is advisable to use a large apparatus.\r\nWhen the copper extraction vessel is made to have its greatest diameter\r\nabout 1 metre, it can be charged with about 50 kilogrammes of rasped\r\nwood at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.]\r\n\r\nThe extraction apparatus of Hänig and O. Reinhard is shown in Fig. 38.\r\nIt can be turned over by means of cog-wheels. In the cover are an air\r\nvalve, _e_, and safety valve, _f_; below the cover is a coil, _k_,\r\nfed with cold water from _c_. In the extraction, by opening the valve\r\n_v_, steam enters through _a_ at _l_; it is condensed by the cooled\r\ncover, the condensed water flows through the material on the sieve,\r\nand collects in the space B. After some time _v_ and _z_ are opened,\r\nthe liquid is then boiled by the steam in the coil, _s_. Steam rises\r\nthrough the material, is condensed on the cover, and again drops down.\r\nAt the end of the operation the solution is drawn off through the cock,\r\n_h_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.]\r\n\r\n=Kohlrausch’s Process for Obtaining Concentrated Extracts of Colouring\r\nMatters and Tannins.=—When dye-wood or tan-bark is continually brought\r\nin contact with fresh quantities of water, after some time it is\r\nexhausted; if the solution containing a certain quantity of the soluble\r\nmatters is brought in contact with fresh material not yet extracted,\r\nit takes up more soluble matter, and thus becomes more concentrated.\r\nThe substances contained in tan-bark are very soluble in water, so that\r\nby the appropriate treatment of a certain quantity of bark, divided\r\namongst different vessels, with a certain quantity of water, on the\r\none hand the bark can be exhausted completely, and on the other very\r\nconcentrated solutions (”bark extracts”) obtained. The process patented\r\nby Kohlrausch is based upon the principles just stated; it can be\r\nused to obtain tannin extracts from tan-bark and colour extracts from\r\ndye-wood. In this process the raw materials need not be finely ground\r\nin order to be completely extracted; they may be used in large pieces.\r\nIt will be understood from the following description that fine bark\r\nmeal or finely-rasped dye-wood could not be worked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of a number of 10 to 20 extractors connected\r\ntogether, also with a water tank above, and with a boiler. A single\r\nextractor is represented in section in Fig. 39, together with\r\nthe necessary pipes and valves by which it is connected with the\r\nneighbouring extractors, the water tank and the boiler. Fig. 40 is a\r\nplan of three extractors connected together.\r\n\r\nThe extractors consist of wooden or copper vessels, slightly conical\r\nin shape, and of sufficient strength to resist the pressure of one\r\natmosphere. On the top is a copper dome closed by a lid, through which\r\nthe raw material is introduced, and also steam and water. Immediately\r\nabove the bottom is an opening, also closed by a screw, which serves\r\nto remove the exhausted materials. An inclined sieve is placed at some\r\ndistance above the bottom; upon this the material rests. The extract\r\ncollects below the sieve, and may be run off by the pipe or brought\r\ninto another extractor. All the metallic portions of the apparatus\r\nwhich come in contact with the liquid must be made of a metal such as\r\ncopper, which does not act upon tannic acid. Iron cannot be used; it\r\nforms deep bluish or greenish black compounds with tannic acid, which\r\nwould cause the extract, instead of being pale and clear, to resemble\r\nordinary writing ink.\r\n\r\nIn a range of 10 extractors the process is carried out in the following\r\nmanner: The extractors numbered 1 to 10 are filled with bark or\r\ndye-wood and closed; 1 is then filled with water from the tank, and\r\nheated by steam to 50° to 70° C. After some time the contents of 1 are\r\nforced into 2, and 1 is again filled with water, so that the material\r\nin 2 is in contact with the solution from 1, whilst the material in 1\r\nis warmed with a fresh quantity of water under pressure; the extract\r\nin 2 is transferred to 3, that in 1 to 2, and 1 is again filled with\r\nwater, and so on. Finally from 10 a very strong extract of tannin\r\nor colouring matter is obtained. The quantity of water required to\r\nfill one extractor has come ten times in contact with fresh bark\r\nor dye-wood. The material in 1 has been treated with ten times the\r\nquantity of water; it is now exhausted, and is replaced by fresh\r\nmaterial. The sequence of the vessels is now changed. The original\r\nextractor 2 is to be regarded as 1, and 1 as 10. After ten repetitions\r\nthe original order of the extractors re-obtains. Ninety-nine per cent.\r\nof the tannic acid of bark is extracted in this way.\r\n\r\nThe concentrated extracts obtained in this apparatus should be mixed\r\nwith a little carbolic acid to prevent decomposition; they may then\r\nbe filled into barrels. The extracts may also be so far concentrated\r\nby evaporation that they become syrupy. The tannins are readily\r\ndecomposed; they would be considerably altered if their solutions were\r\nevaporated in open vessels. The extracts are therefore evaporated at a\r\nvery low temperature under diminished pressure in vacuum pans, which\r\nare now much used for the concentration of solutions of substances,\r\nsuch as sugar, which would be injured by heating above a certain\r\ntemperature. Essentially, a vacuum pan is a thick-walled copper vessel,\r\nin which the liquid is warmed by a steam coil. It is connected with an\r\nair pump, which exhausts the air at the commencement of an operation,\r\nand afterwards steam. The liquid is thus constantly evaporated under\r\na low pressure. Extracts of tan-bark and dye-woods boil briskly\r\nunder these conditions at temperatures below 60° C., at which no\r\ndecomposition of the tannin or the colouring matter is to be feared.\r\nWhen the solutions have been evaporated to the proper strength they are\r\nrun off directly into the packages in which they are to be despatched,\r\nand in which they become syrupy or even solid masses, according to the\r\nextent to which the evaporation has been driven.\r\n\r\nThe packages should be at once closed; the thick extract is thereby\r\nmost simply and safely prevented from decomposing, to which risk it\r\nwould be exposed by the access of mould spores. If these were already\r\npresent in the barrels or were communicated to the extract by the air,\r\nthey would either be killed by the hot liquid or would be prevented\r\nfrom developing for a long time. In the closed vessels the extracts\r\nremain completely unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe concentrated solution of colouring matter obtained by extracting\r\ndye-woods in the above apparatus can be at once used, after dilution,\r\nin the preparation of lakes and in dyeing, but it is not an extract in\r\nthe ordinary commercial sense of the term, _i.e._, it does not solidify\r\non cooling. To obtain solid extracts the concentrated solutions must\r\nbe evaporated; concentration with fire heat would be attended with\r\ndanger to the quality of the extract, steam heat is therefore used.\r\nThe liquid to be evaporated is brought into shallow steam-jacketed\r\npans, in which the operation is continued until the liquid solidifies\r\ninto a resin-like mass when dropped on cold stone. When sufficiently\r\nevaporated the extract is allowed to solidify, broken into lumps,\r\nand these packed whilst still warm into barrels lined with paper.\r\nThe lining is necessary on account of the hygroscopic nature of the\r\nextracts; when they are exposed to the air they absorb water and form a\r\nviscous fluid which soon becomes mouldy.\r\n\r\nA properly prepared dye-wood extract should dissolve in water without\r\nresidue, and the solution when largely diluted should show the\r\ncharacteristic colour of the wood with no brownish shade, and when the\r\ncolouring matter is precipitated from such a solution by a metallic\r\nsalt the residual solution should be almost colourless. If the extract\r\ndissolves incompletely in water and the solution is brown after\r\nprecipitation of the colouring matter, the extract has been burnt in\r\nthe evaporation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLogwood and logwood extract contain two substances of importance\r\nin dyeing and colour making. These are hæmatoxylin and hæmateïn.\r\nHæmatoxylin is found in logwood in greatest amount shortly before the\r\nwood is cut. When pure it forms colourless crystals of a peculiar sweet\r\ntaste, which are soluble in cold water with difficulty, more easily\r\nin hot, and readily soluble in alcohol or ether. The composition of\r\nhæmatoxylin is expressed by the formula C₁₆H₁₄O₆.\r\n\r\nHæmatoxylin is not a colouring matter. It is important because from it\r\nis obtained the essential colouring matter of logwood—hæmateïn. When a\r\ntrace of ammonia is added to the colourless solution of hæmatoxylin,\r\nthe liquid at once becomes dark red owing to the formation of hæmateïn.\r\nWhen a larger quantity of ammonia is added the liquid acquires a deep\r\nred colour, and then contains only hæmateïn (its ammonia compound),\r\nwhich is formed according to the following equation:—\r\n\r\n    C₁₆H₁₄O₆ + NH₃ + O = C₁₆H₉O₅.NH₄ + 2H₂O.\r\n\r\nTo obtain hæmateïn in the pure state it is then only necessary to add\r\nsufficient acetic acid to decompose the hæmateïn ammonia compound.\r\nHæmateïn separates as dark violet crystals, which readily dissolve in\r\nwater and alcohol; its aqueous solution gives blue precipitates with\r\nthe majority of the metallic salts. This behaviour of hæmatoxylin\r\ntowards ammonia explains the increase in colouring power of logwood,\r\nwhich has been exposed for a long time to the action of the air in the\r\nrasped state. Through the action of the ammonia in the air a larger\r\nquantity of the hæmateïn ammonia compound has been formed. It has\r\nbeen proposed to facilitate the formation of this ammonia compound\r\nby moistening rasped logwood with a very dilute glue solution and\r\nallowing it to lie in the air. This process can only have the object\r\nof utilising in the formation of hæmateïn the ammonia resulting from\r\nthe decomposition of the glue, but in this decomposition deep-seated\r\nreactions occur, which might affect the hæmateïn itself. It thus\r\nappears more suitable to effect the formation of hæmateïn by the direct\r\nuse of ammonia. This can be done with little cost by watering heaps of\r\nrasped logwood with ammonia and repeatedly shovelling about the wood\r\nso that it comes into contact with the air. The author has found that\r\nthe conversion of hæmatoxylin to hæmateïn is very complete in this\r\nprocess; care should be taken not to make the layer of rasped wood too\r\ndeep, and to take its temperature frequently. In the transformation\r\nof hæmatoxylin to hæmateïn the temperature rises, the rise might be\r\ninjurious if it proceeded too far. Thus if the temperature of the\r\ninterior of the heap is found to be high the wood should be turned over.\r\n\r\nThe solution of the logwood colouring matter produces handsome lakes,\r\nall of which have, however, the inconvenient property of acquiring\r\nan ugly grey colour on long standing. The finest and most durable of\r\nthe logwood lakes is known as violet lake, which is made with alumina\r\nsalts. The best result is obtained when a solution of aluminium\r\nacetate, obtained by precipitating alum with lead acetate, is mixed\r\nwith a logwood decoction or a solution of logwood extract. The\r\nprecipitate is pale or deep violet according to the amount of aluminium\r\nsalt added. After drying to a certain point at a gentle heat it can be\r\nmixed with gum solution to a paste, which is then completely dried.\r\n\r\nLogwood is most valuable in dyeing and calico printing, in which it\r\nserves to produce a fine and durable black. When potassium chromate is\r\nadded to a decoction of logwood a deep black liquid results, which can\r\nbe used as a good and cheap writing ink. If somewhat stronger solutions\r\nare used a greenish precipitate first separates, which soon acquires a\r\npure black hue; it is the chromium lake of hæmateïn. This compound is\r\nvery durable and is largely used in dyeing to produce fast blacks. The\r\nblack precipitate might be dried and used as an artists’ black pigment\r\nif the carbon blacks were not cheaper and more durable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nGREEN LAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe yellow colouring matters produce green compounds with copper salts.\r\nThese are important because they can be produced without great cost,\r\nand are not as poisonous as the arsenic pigments, although copper\r\ncompounds are far more poisonous substances than should be used for\r\ncertain purposes. Their employment might be attended with danger if\r\nused to colour children’s toys and pictures.\r\n\r\nThese green copper lakes are simply made by adding copper sulphate\r\nsolution, free from iron, to a hot decoction of yellow berries or\r\nweld until the liquid is emerald green, and then adding caustic soda\r\nsolution in small quantities to precipitate the lake. The temperature\r\nof the liquid should not be more than 50° to 60° C. when the caustic\r\nsoda is added. It has been maintained that these lakes turn out well\r\nonly when the precipitation is so conducted that the residual liquid is\r\nquite colourless. The author has, however, found it more satisfactory\r\nto discontinue the addition of caustic soda when the liquid is somewhat\r\ncoloured, since when the precipitation is complete other substances\r\nbesides colouring matter may be precipitated.\r\n\r\n=Chlorophyll.=—All the higher plants contain the same green colouring\r\nmatter—chlorophyll. It has a very fine shade, is fairly fast, and the\r\nraw material from which it is produced is to be obtained at nominal\r\ncost. Special attention should, therefore, be paid to this colouring\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nChlorophyll is very easily obtained. Grass of a good green, green\r\nleaves, or any green portion of a plant is allowed to stand with weak\r\ncaustic soda solution in a large vessel for twenty-four to thirty\r\nhours. The liquid is poured off, brought to the boil for a moment, at\r\nonce filtered and neutralised with hydrochloric acid. The chlorophyll,\r\nwhich has been dissolved by the caustic soda, is then thrown down as a\r\ngrass green precipitate; after washing and drying it can be used as a\r\npigment. A chlorophyll lake can be obtained by dissolving the colouring\r\nmatter in caustic soda and adding alum solution. The green precipitate\r\nis a compound of chlorophyll and alumina.\r\n\r\nTschirch gives the following method for obtaining chlorophyll: Green\r\nleaves (grass), not containing tannin, are extracted with boiling\r\nalcohol, the extract cooled, filtered and evaporated until a sticky\r\nmass remains. This is washed with hot water until the washings are\r\ncolourless, and the residue extracted with cold alcohol. The solution\r\nis evaporated to half its volume, the separated crystals are dissolved\r\nin alcohol, and the solution heated on the water bath with zinc dust.\r\nA deep emerald green solution with a red fluorescence is obtained; it\r\ncan be preserved unaltered for a long time in blue glass bottles. It\r\nretains its colour in diffused daylight also for a lengthy period. A\r\nbeautiful green chlorophyll lake is obtained by boiling this solution\r\nwith the solution of an aluminium salt and precipitating with soda.\r\nUnfortunately, the lake is not fast. The chlorophyll solution obtained\r\nby this process is quite innocuous, and is well adapted for colouring\r\nliqueurs and confectionery.\r\n\r\n=Sap Green.=—This lake, also known as bladder green, is obtained from\r\nunripe yellow (Persian) berries. It can be used as a water colour, but\r\nnot in oil painting. This pigment differs from the ordinary yellow\r\nberry lake in colour and chemical composition; the yellow lake is a\r\ncompound of xanthorhamnin with the metallic oxide, whilst sap green\r\ncontains an uncrystallisable bitter substance, rhamnocathartin.\r\n\r\nThe lake is obtained from yellow berries which are not quite ripe.\r\nThey are broken up and left in a warm place. The mass soon ferments;\r\nafter about ten days it is pressed. Four parts of the liquid are then\r\nmixed with 0·5 part of alum and 0·5 part of potassium carbonate. The\r\nsalts are dissolved in boiling water, and the solutions added to the\r\nhot sap. The mixture is then evaporated to the consistency of a thick\r\nsyrup, which is generally packed in animal bladders, hence the name of\r\n”bladder green”. Some care is necessary in the evaporation to prevent\r\nthe burning of the soft mass on the bottom of the vessel. If the\r\nevaporation is carried somewhat further the mass solidifies on cooling;\r\nit is then black, and only transmits green light at the edges. The use\r\nof potash in preparing sap green is attended with the disadvantage that\r\nthe hygroscopic nature of the salt prevents the colour from drying. If\r\nmagnesia is used instead of potash the lake dries far more rapidly,\r\nbut has much less covering power. Sap green is principally used for\r\ncolouring paper and leather.\r\n\r\nOrange-coloured lakes also can be obtained from yellow berries by\r\nprecipitating the decoction with stannic chloride. These lakes are not\r\ndirectly employed, but are produced immediately upon the fabric in\r\ndyeing.\r\n\r\n=Chinese Green, Lokao.=—Under this description a green lake has\r\nrecently been imported from China. It is a valuable pigment. Chinese\r\ngreen is sold in flat cakes, which are blue, with a green or violet\r\nlustre. The powdered lake is pure green and partially soluble in\r\nwater; it contains colouring matter, water and inorganic matter\r\nconsisting chiefly of clay and lime.\r\n\r\nChinese green is made in China in a peculiar manner from the twigs\r\nof certain species of _Rhamnus_. According to report, the bark is\r\nboiled with water and a cotton cloth immersed in the decoction. The\r\nfibre fixes a colourless substance which becomes green on exposure to\r\nair. The cotton is repeatedly dipped into the decoction until it has\r\nabsorbed a large quantity of colouring matter. It is then washed with\r\ncold water and boiled with water upon which cotton yarn is laid. The\r\ncolouring matter suspended in the liquid adheres to the yarn, which\r\nis washed with a little cold water, and the colouring matter then\r\ncollected upon paper and dried.\r\n\r\nIf Chinese green is really made by this process, it is not a lake but\r\na vegetable colouring matter, to which clay has been added to increase\r\nits weight or to make it plastic. Very fine lakes can be obtained from\r\nChinese green by dissolving it in a solution of alum, and adding soda\r\nsolution. When Chinese green is dissolved in acetic acid and ammonium\r\nchloride and a zinc salt added, a blue lake is produced on the further\r\naddition of sodium acetate. A bluish violet lake is obtained by\r\ntreating Chinese green with a strong reducing agent and adding calcium\r\nacetate.\r\n\r\n=Charvin’s Green.=—The very high price at which genuine Chinese green\r\nwas sold whilst it was still a novelty, gave rise to attempts at\r\nimitation. Charvin, of Lyons, succeeded in producing a pigment from\r\n_Rhamnus_ which has the characteristic property of Chinese green of\r\nretaining its colour in artificial light. He plunged the bark of common\r\nbuckthorn into boiling water, boiled for a few minutes, and allowed\r\nthe whole to stand for twenty-four hours. Lime water was added to the\r\nbrown liquid, which was then exposed to the action of the air in\r\nshallow vessels, when it gradually turned green and deposited a green\r\nprecipitate. When this appeared, the liquid was brought into glass\r\nvessels and potassium carbonate solution added so long as a precipitate\r\nresulted, which after drying had all the properties of genuine Chinese\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nAlthough for some time Chinese green was a very fashionable colour, its\r\nuse is now almost discontinued, although it can be used with advantage\r\nas an artists’ pigment, and its preparation by Charvin’s method is\r\nneither difficult nor specially costly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nBROWN ORGANIC PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Asphaltum= is found in large deposits in several regions of the earth.\r\nIt is a compound of carbon and hydrogen, and varies in appearance from\r\ncobblers’ wax to tar. Asphaltum is of organic origin and is closely\r\nrelated to the mineral oils. Among the pigments usually employed by\r\nartists asphaltum plays an important part; it produces very warm\r\nshades between brown and deep black. The preparation of asphaltum for\r\nartists’ use is very simple. Good uniform lumps, free from sand and\r\nother impurities, are coarsely powdered and mixed with a solvent in a\r\nwell-stoppered flask. Asphaltum readily dissolves in essential oils,\r\nand also, though with more difficulty, in fatty oils. It dissolves\r\nslowly at the ordinary temperature, but quickly on warming. On account\r\nof the inflammability of the essential oils generally used, certain\r\nprecautions must be taken. The asphaltum is mixed with turpentine\r\nin a large flask which is well closed and heated by hot water. In a\r\nshort time a viscous mass is formed which is mixed with the solvent by\r\nshaking.\r\n\r\nAsphaltum may also be prepared, without dissolving, by powdering and\r\ngrinding with oil exactly as a mineral pigment.\r\n\r\n=Sepia.=—This brown pigment has a warm hue which is not readily\r\nsurpassed. It is an animal product; the cuttle-fish, a species of\r\ncephalopod which abounds in all warm seas, produces a peculiar\r\ncolouring matter which is stored in a sac, commonly called the ink-bag.\r\nIt is used by the animal for protection, when pursued it ejects the\r\ncontents of the bag, and thus makes the surrounding water so dark that\r\nit is enabled to escape.\r\n\r\nSepia is made almost exclusively in Italy. The contents of the ink-bag\r\nare quickly dried, and then rubbed with strong caustic lye to a thick\r\npulp. More caustic lye is then added, and the mixture heated almost to\r\nboiling; from the filtered solution sulphuric acid precipitates the\r\npure colouring matter.\r\n\r\nAs one of the most handsome brown pigments, sepia is largely used, but\r\nunfortunately it can only be used as a water colour. On account of its\r\ncost, sepia is frequently imitated. Vegetable substances are charred,\r\nextracted, and the extract concentrated until it solidifies on cooling;\r\nit is then finely powdered, made into a paste with gum Arabic or\r\ntragacanth, and formed into cakes. All such imitations are, however, so\r\nimperfect that they are at once recognised. On comparison with genuine\r\nsepia, none of them is found to possess the warm shade peculiar to\r\nsepia.\r\n\r\nBrown colouring matters can be obtained by heating all soft portions of\r\nplants. The products have a deep brown shade in consequence of the high\r\nproportion of carbon they contain. When the young twigs of soft woods\r\nare exposed in closed cylinders to a temperature of about 300° to 400°\r\nC., and the residue powdered, colours ranging from a dark rust brown to\r\nalmost pure black are produced. The higher the temperature employed the\r\nmore nearly the shade approaches to black.\r\n\r\nParts of plants which contain sugar or similar compounds become deep\r\nbrown at comparatively a low temperature. The colour, which varies from\r\nbrown to hyacinth red, is due to caramel. This substance is produced\r\nwhen coffee, beetroot, or chicory root, all of which contain a large\r\nproportion of sugar, are heated. Such pigments are little used; they\r\ncannot be ground with oil, and in water can rarely be mixed with other\r\ncolours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nSAP COLOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the designation of ”sap colours” several pigments are brought\r\ninto the market in the condition in which they are ready for immediate\r\nuse in printing. The term is practically restricted to lake pigments\r\nwhich form a transparent layer when dry, thus the sap colours may be\r\ndefined as dissolved lakes mixed in a viscous medium, such as thick\r\ngum solution. In general the sap colours are not much used, since when\r\nwetted with water they again dissolve, which is not the case with\r\npigments ground in oil. Yet for certain purposes they are commonly\r\nused, as in the manufacture of playing cards.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of these pigments only colouring matters soluble\r\nin water can be used, the number of which is restricted. According to\r\na particular method a tin lake is first made, which is decomposed by\r\na strong base, such as ammonia, so that the colouring matter again\r\ngoes into solution. The very deep coloured liquid is then mixed with a\r\nthickener and an indifferent white substance such as flour or starch,\r\nformed into thin sticks, and sent into the market.\r\n\r\nA decoction of buckthorn berries is used for the yellow sap colours.\r\nIt is considerably evaporated, and then mixed with 2 to 3 per cent. of\r\nalum, after which starch paste or gum Arabic and sugar are added in\r\nproper quantity, and the mixture evaporated at a low temperature so\r\nthat it is not browned by over-heating.\r\n\r\nWhen a tin lake is employed in the preparation of a sap colour, the\r\nprecipitate obtained by adding stannic chloride to the solution of\r\nthe colouring matter is washed, and, without drying, treated with a\r\nsmall quantity of strong ammonia; generally about 10 per cent. of\r\nthe volume of the precipitate is sufficient to dissolve the lake. It\r\nis always better to leave a portion of the precipitate undissolved\r\nthan to modify the colour by the addition of too much ammonia. The\r\nprecipitate should be dissolved in a glass vessel; the liquid is well\r\nstirred, covered over, and allowed to stand until the undissolved\r\nportion of the precipitate has settled. The ammoniacal solution of the\r\ncolouring matter cannot be concentrated by evaporation. Thus, before\r\nthe precipitate is dissolved it must be well freed from water by long\r\ndraining. To give the solution the proper consistency about an equal\r\nquantity of thick gum solution is added, and then sufficient starch\r\nto form a paste which can be rolled into thin sticks, which are then\r\ndried upon boards at a gentle heat. Sap colours are made in exactly the\r\nsame way from any other colouring matter adapted to the purpose. In\r\nusing these colours it is simply necessary to bring them into water;\r\nif they contain only gum and sugar in addition to colouring matter\r\nthey completely dissolve, but if they contain starch the solution is\r\nincomplete. As a rule starch is only added to give the colour the\r\nconsistency requisite for printing.\r\n\r\nRed sap colours can be made either from red wood lake or from cochineal\r\ncarmine; the former is used in ammoniacal solution, the latter as a\r\nsolution of the pure carmine in ammonia. The colour is prepared from\r\nred wood by allowing a decoction to stand for several days, adding 2\r\nto 3 per cent. of alum, evaporating and thickening with gum solution.\r\nThis colour is cheap, but cannot compare in beauty with that obtained\r\nby treating red wood tin lake with ammonia. The solution of genuine\r\ncarmine in ammonia produces a sap colour which leaves nothing to be\r\ndesired in regard to shade, but on account of the cost of carmine\r\nit can but rarely be used. A solution of pure indigo carmine mixed\r\nwith gum solution is used as a blue sap colour; it can be shaded by\r\nadditions of red or yellow colours. Chinese blue may be used instead\r\nof indigo carmine; it dissolves in a solution of oxalic acid. When\r\nChinese blue, which has been thoroughly washed, is mixed whilst still\r\nmoist with a little saturated oxalic acid solution, the blue dissolves,\r\nand the solution may then be made into a paste by the addition of\r\nthickening materials.\r\n\r\nGreen sap colours are made, as a rule, by mixing yellow and blue. All\r\nshades can be thus obtained. A green colour of different composition\r\nis obtained by boiling the violet solution of chrome alum with gum\r\nsolution until the colour changes to green. Violet colours are obtained\r\nby mixing red and blue. Sepia produces a brown sap colour.\r\n\r\nIt has been proposed to use glucose in place of the much dearer gum\r\nArabic, and also to use malt extract as thickener. These substances\r\nabsorb water from the air, and thus the colours prepared with them\r\nnever become quite hard, but always remain pasty. For some purposes\r\nthis is a decided advantage, since such colours can be readily taken up\r\nby the brush and easily rubbed up with water, but they cannot be formed\r\ninto cakes as is usually done with water colours. When the colours are\r\nto be made into cakes they must be thickened with gum Arabic alone,\r\nwithout glucose or malt extract. The cakes must be dried with great\r\ncare; if they are dried too quickly they will crack or even fall to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nWATER COLOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe colours thus called are so prepared that they easily mix with water\r\nto such a condition that they can be applied with the brush. Special\r\npigments are not required for this purpose, ordinary dry colours are\r\nsimply mixed with a binding medium soluble in water, and the paste is\r\ngenerally pressed into cakes. In commerce very different qualities\r\nof water colours are found, ranging from cheap children’s playthings\r\nto the most costly colours used by painters in water colour. Those\r\npigments which are not already in very fine powder, in consequence\r\nof the process by which they are made, such as chrome yellow, must\r\nbe subjected to a very careful process of levigation. To simplify as\r\nfar as possible this laborious process, it should be conducted by\r\ngrinding the pigment as finely as possible, well stirring it in a tub\r\nwith water, allowing to rest for several minutes, and then running off\r\nthe liquid into a second tub, from which it is again drawn off into a\r\nthird after several, minutes. The liquid remains in the last vessel\r\nuntil it is quite clear, when the deposit is collected. This is now so\r\nfine a powder that a powerful microscope is required to distinguish\r\nthe separate particles. The residue in the first and second vessels\r\nconsists of the coarser particles; it is again ground with fresh\r\nmaterial. In this process regard must be given to the specific gravity\r\nof the material: the higher it is the shorter is the time during\r\nwhich the liquid is allowed to remain in the tubs, since the coarser\r\nparticles of heavy substances settle very rapidly. In dealing with the\r\nlight lakes, such as the alumina lakes, the liquid in which the lake\r\nis suspended must remain much longer at rest. Two vessels may be used\r\ninstead of three, without danger of the precipitate containing coarse\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\nGum Arabic and tragacanth are used as binding materials for the\r\npigments. Dextrine is also much used in place of the expensive gums;\r\nfor this purpose only pure white dextrine should be used, since the\r\nbrown colour of ordinary dextrine would injure the shade of the\r\ncolours, especially of pale colours. Gum Arabic and dextrine, which\r\nare readily soluble in water, require no special preparation before\r\ntheir solutions are mixed with the pigments. The solutions are made by\r\ntreating with water; they are then allowed to stand for several days in\r\na tall vessel so that impurities may settle. If the solutions are very\r\nturbid, they are filtered through closely woven linen.\r\n\r\nGum tragacanth requires rather different treatment. It is not\r\ncompletely soluble in water, in which it only swells up to a great\r\nextent. It is prepared by leaving it for several days in water, and\r\nwhen it has swollen, rubbing the slimy mass in a mortar until it is\r\ncompletely uniform.\r\n\r\nThe levigated pigments are allowed to dry in the air to a soft paste,\r\nwhich is mixed with the proper quantity of gum Arabic and tragacanth\r\nsolutions. As a rule the two gums are used together. The colouring\r\nmatter and binding medium may simply be ground together, but long\r\ngrinding would be required to produce a completely homogeneous mixture.\r\nThe costly manual labour is therefore as far as possible replaced by\r\nmachinery, by which means a cheaper and also more uniform product is\r\nobtained. The machines by which the pigment is ground with the binding\r\nmaterial are of simple construction. They consist of rollers placed in\r\npairs one above the other and moving in opposite directions. The two\r\nrollers of each pair are connected by cog-wheels, in such a way that\r\nthe lower moves more slowly than the upper. In consequence of this\r\narrangement, the rollers, in addition to crushing, exert a grinding\r\naction upon the viscous mass passing between them. As a rule, after the\r\ncolour has passed through one pair of rollers, it goes through a second\r\nand third, from the last of which it is taken off by a scraper. It is\r\nnow completely uniform.\r\n\r\nThe binding medium must be of such consistency that, after grinding\r\nwith the pigment, a fairly stiff paste results which is suitable for\r\npressing. The cakes of colour are pressed out in an ordinary spindle\r\npress, which should be so constructed that the stamp in the down stroke\r\ncomes upon the paste beneath it and stamps out cakes upon which the\r\nengraving of the die is clearly shown. If the cakes crack when slowly\r\ndried, the medium contains too much gum Arabic. If the impression\r\nof the die upon the cakes is not sharp, and if they remain rather\r\nelastic when completely dry, too much tragacanth has been used. It is\r\nrather difficult to grind a stiff paste, many manufacturers prefer to\r\ngrind the colour in a rather more fluid condition, and then to allow\r\nthe paste to thicken by drying to the consistency necessary for the\r\nproduction of good cakes.\r\n\r\nThe moulds in which the cakes are made must be very carefully worked in\r\nmetal, so that the description and trade mark print clearly upon the\r\ncakes. The cakes should be dried at the ordinary temperature or but\r\nlittle higher. They are placed upon smooth boards, and care is taken\r\nthat the temperature of the drying room remains uniform, which is the\r\ncondition requisite for the production of the fewest cracks. When it is\r\nintended to place on the market only faultless and well-stamped cakes\r\nthey must be sorted when dry, and the cracked ones rejected; these can\r\nbe worked up in the next operation.\r\n\r\nThe dry cakes are given a good appearance by coating them with a weak\r\nsolution of gum, and then drying. According to the price at which these\r\ncolours are to be sold the cakes are given a different character. The\r\nfinest colours are generally made into larger cakes and packed in\r\nhandsome boxes, whilst ordinary cheap colours are made into small lumps\r\nor circular plates, flat on one side and somewhat convex on the other,\r\nand packed in boxes of soft wood.\r\n\r\n=Moist Water Colours.=—Instead of grinding water colours with gum\r\nArabic or tragacanth and bringing them on the market in the dry state,\r\nthey may also be sold in a condition resembling that of oil paints.\r\nThis may be accomplished by using very viscid glucose syrup instead\r\nof gum Arabic, and grinding the pigments in this exactly as in oil.\r\nGlucose is very hygroscopic, the colours prepared with it remain moist,\r\nand may be spread out upon the palette like oil colours. It is then\r\nonly necessary to wet the brush in water and mix the mass with it in\r\norder to obtain colour of the proper consistency.\r\n\r\nMoist water colours have also been known as ”honey colours,” since this\r\nmixture of sugars was formerly used for their preparation; it also is\r\nhygroscopic. Honey is no longer used; the much cheaper glucose answers\r\nthe same purpose. On account of their semi-fluid nature, moist water\r\ncolours are put up in tubes just as oil colours. They are thus rather\r\ndear, but are little used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nCRAYONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCrayons are coloured pencils by which pictures may be, so to speak,\r\n”dry painted”. At present this method of painting is little used,\r\nthough it was in vogue in the last century, but coloured pencils,\r\nespecially blue and red, are much used for writing. Crayons are now\r\nused in a very convenient form, being generally made in the same manner\r\nas lead pencils. The coloured mixture from which the crayon is made\r\nis produced in the form of a paste containing a soft, finely ground\r\nmineral, well mixed with the colouring matter and an amount of binding\r\nmedium just sufficient to hold the powders together.\r\n\r\nGypsum is generally used as the soft white mineral forming the base\r\nof the coloured mass. It is much better to use steatite (soap-stone),\r\nwhich is not much dearer, and has many advantages over gypsum. The\r\npreference given to steatite is based upon a comparison of the\r\nproperties of the two minerals; gypsum is crystalline, steatite is\r\nnon-crystalline. Powdered gypsum has essentially a dry character,\r\nwhilst powdered soap-stone is of a peculiar greasy nature, and\r\nconsequently can be readily smeared upon a flat surface; it also\r\nimparts a pleasing lustre to the colours with which it is mixed.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of crayons consists in preparing and moulding the\r\ncoloured mass. The process is commenced by mixing the powdered colour\r\nand soap-stone in a closed rotating cylinder. The rotation is continued\r\nuntil the mixture is uniform in colour. The quantity of colour to\r\nbe mixed with the soap-stone depends upon the shade to be produced.\r\nManufacturers who make a speciality of crayons prepare a number of\r\nshades of each colour. The artists who use crayons, however, usually\r\nrequire only those of a pure shade, since they themselves can produce\r\nthe intermediate shades from the essential colours. On this account it\r\nis advisable to make crayons of distinct and deep colours. The mineral\r\npigments are the most suitable: for yellow, deep chrome yellow; for\r\nred, vermilion or deep madder lake; for green, one of the pure green\r\npigments, such as chrome green; for blue, Chinese blue or ultramarine;\r\nfor brown, burnt sienna or manganese bistre. For white and black\r\ncrayons levigated chalk is used, alone or mixed with a sufficient\r\nquantity of fine vine black or some other good black. Either gum Arabic\r\nor size may be used as binding material. When the former is employed\r\nthe crayon becomes so brittle when dry that it breaks when pointed with\r\nthe knife, in spite of the greatest care. Size produces a less brittle\r\ncrayon, and is also much cheaper, so that it is preferred.\r\n\r\nThe paste from which the crayons are to be formed is made by mixing\r\nthin size with the colouring matter and steatite to a soft pulp, which\r\nis then kneaded to secure uniformity. The process then proceeds in a\r\ndifferent manner according as the crayon is to be pressed or sawn out.\r\n\r\nFor producing the crayons by pressing, a simple apparatus is required.\r\nIt consists of a horizontal metal cylinder with a well-fitting piston.\r\nThe front of the cylinder is closed by a metal plate in which is an\r\norifice of rather greater diameter than the crayons to be made. In\r\nfront of the cylinder is an endless band which moves away from it. In\r\nusing this apparatus to shape the crayons, the paste is made of such\r\nconsistency that a slight pressure forces it out of the orifice in the\r\nfront of the cylinder in a coherent rod. When the cylinder is filled\r\nwith the paste, care must be taken that it includes no air bubbles,\r\nfor these would cause the rod to break. The piston is then put in\r\nposition and the mass forced by uniform gentle pressure out of the\r\nnarrow opening. The endless band must move away at the same rate as\r\nthe rod proceeds from the cylinder, so that a long stick of the crayon\r\nmass rests upon it. This stick is cut up by a blunt knife into uniform\r\nlengths, which are dried upon boards covered with blotting paper, and\r\nare then enclosed in casings similar to those of the ordinary lead\r\npencil. The rods must be given a rather greater diameter than they are\r\nto possess when dry, since they shrink somewhat in drying.\r\n\r\nThe second method consists in producing a thick paste which is moulded\r\ninto blocks of the length of the crayons. These blocks are very slowly\r\ndried at a uniform temperature, and when completely dry, are cut by a\r\nfine saw into thin rods, which are then enclosed in a wooden case. The\r\npowder produced in sawing is used in the next operation. This simple\r\nprocess has many drawbacks. In the first place it is difficult in\r\ndrying large blocks of the crayon mass to avoid cracks, which must be\r\ncarefully filled with thin paste. Also in sawing up the blocks a large\r\nnumber of rods will be broken, even with the most careful treatment\r\n(these are again worked up with the powder produced in sawing). Thus,\r\ngenerally, the formation of crayons by pressure is preferred.\r\n\r\nIt is important to dry the crayon rods so far that they do not shrink\r\nfurther after they are placed in the case; otherwise they would break\r\nup when sharpened. At times it is quite impossible to make a usable\r\npoint on such a faulty crayon.\r\n\r\n=Crayons for Earthenware.=—Crayons for this purpose are made, according\r\nto M. Rösler, by finely powdering colours suitable for glass and\r\nearthenware, and mixing them to a paste with a solution of 2 parts of\r\ngum Arabic and 1 part of Marseilles soap. Pencils are then moulded from\r\nthe paste and wrapped in a strip of paper just previously dipped in a\r\npaste of gypsum. Upon unglazed articles or ground glass these crayons\r\ncan be used like a lead pencil. The colour is fixed by burning in the\r\nusual manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nCONFECTIONERY COLOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nConfectioners employ several colours. Yellow, brown and black are\r\nusually obtained by means of caramel; the other colours, red, green\r\nand blue, which are also largely used, must be made from harmless\r\ncompounds. Unfortunately, colour makers have been known to offer the\r\nconsumer for this purpose colours which by no means correspond to this\r\nrequirement; even the poisonous arsenic pigments have been used for\r\ncolouring sweets. In such a case the user of the colours is less to be\r\nblamed than the manufacturer, who should sell for this purpose only\r\ncolours in no way injurious to health. Fortunately we possess among\r\nthe pigments of organic origin a sufficient number to satisfy these\r\nrequirements: for green, either sap green or leaf green may be used\r\nwithout hesitation; for red, cochineal carmine is well suited, and for\r\nblue, indigo carmine. The two pigments last named are indeed expensive,\r\nbut since they possess great colouring power they can still be used for\r\ncolouring cheap sweets.\r\n\r\nFor colouring liqueurs equal care must be taken to choose non-injurious\r\ncolours. Those mentioned above may also be used for this purpose.\r\nRecently these colours have been largely displaced by the aniline dyes,\r\nwhich are particularly adapted by their beauty and great colouring\r\npower for the colouring of confectionery or liqueurs. There should\r\nbe some hesitation in using these dyes for colouring articles of\r\nfood. Some of them are made by means of arsenic compounds, and it is\r\nvery difficult to free them absolutely from every trace of arsenic.\r\nBut supposing the dye to be free from arsenic, there may still be\r\nobjections to its use, for the pure dyes themselves may possess\r\npoisonous properties, and thus ought not to be used for colouring\r\narticles of food.\r\n\r\nFor colouring foods the colours above mentioned are sufficient. Orange\r\nis obtained by mixing caramel with red, violet by mixing red and blue,\r\nand the shades thus produced are quite sufficient for the purpose in\r\nquestion. The colour maker should sell the colours in such a condition\r\nthat they can be used without further preparation. The colours for\r\nconfectioners and liqueur makers should be put on the market in a\r\nsemi-fluid or pasty condition. For this purpose carmine should be\r\nground with a very thick sugar syrup. Leaf green and indigo carmine\r\nrequire no further preparation; they are already semi-fluid, they\r\nreadily diffuse, and are also soluble in alcoholic liquids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE PREPARATION OF PIGMENTS FOR PAINTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the purpose for which they are to be used pigments require\r\na different method of preparation. The preparation of pigments for\r\ncertain special purposes, such as sap colours, cake colours and water\r\ncolours, has been already described. The present chapter deals with the\r\npreparation of those pigments which are used in large quantities by\r\nartists and for ordinary painting.\r\n\r\nColours for artistic purposes require different treatment to those\r\nused for ordinary painting. It is important that both should be ground\r\nto a completely homogeneous mixture with the binding medium. At first\r\nsight this appears to be a simple operation, but in practice there\r\nare difficulties which are not too easily overcome. Artists’ colours\r\nare generally ground with a drying oil. The drying oils are vegetable\r\noils which, when exposed to the air in a thin layer, in a short time\r\nbecome very viscous, and finally completely resinify; linseed, poppy,\r\nand nut oils possess this property. As a rule, artists’ oil paints are\r\nground with poppy oil. To prevent the paint from drying to a solid\r\nmass by exposure to air it is enclosed in protecting vessels. Formerly\r\nthe ground paint was sold in small bags of bladder. These are now no\r\nlonger used; instead, collapsible tubes made of a soft tin alloy are\r\nemployed. They are closed at one end; the other has a neck upon which\r\na metal cap screws down. Pigments ground with just sufficient oil to\r\nform a thick paste may be preserved in these air-tight tubes without\r\naltering in consistency.\r\n\r\nCheaper pigments, such as white lead, white zinc, chrome yellow, etc.,\r\nwhich are principally used in ordinary painting, are ground with raw or\r\nboiled linseed oil. Ordinary boiled oil is made by boiling linseed oil\r\nwith litharge; it contains a certain quantity of lead in solution. It\r\nhas been repeatedly stated in this work that lead compounds are very\r\nsensitive to sulphuretted hydrogen. Pigments which are not themselves\r\naltered by sulphuretted hydrogen acquire a dark shade when they are\r\nground with ordinary lead-boiled oil, because the lead is slowly but\r\ncertainly converted into black lead sulphide on exposure to air. Thus,\r\nin order to retain the original beauty of colour, lead-boiled oil\r\nshould be replaced by oil boiled with manganese borate, which is at\r\nleast as cheap and has the advantage that the oil does not darken in\r\nair. Now that zinc oxide is so cheap it is more and more used in place\r\nof white lead, it is not sensitive to sulphuretted hydrogen, and does\r\nnot even change its colour in an atmosphere of the pure gas. It seems\r\nto be quite illogical to use this pigment with a lead-boiled oil. A\r\ncoating would be quite discoloured in the course of time, whilst,\r\nif used with manganese-boiled oil, it would retain its white shade\r\nunaltered.\r\n\r\nThe dry pigment was formerly mixed with the oil by manual labour. The\r\npigment was spread out upon a smooth stone slab, the oil poured over,\r\nand the two substances rubbed to a uniform paste by means of a glass or\r\nstone rubber known as a muller.\r\n\r\n=Paint Mills= are constructed in various ways. The mixture of colour\r\nand oil is ground either between two metal plates or between two\r\nrollers pressed close together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.]\r\n\r\nFig. 41 represents the construction of a paint mill in which the\r\ngrinding is accomplished by a rotating disc. The mixture of pigment\r\nand oil stirred together is brought into the hopper, T, from which it\r\nmust pass between the rotating grinding disc, M, and the lower surface\r\nof the hopper. The two substances are thus mixed together. The ground\r\npaint flows out of the ring-shaped vessel surrounding M into a receiver\r\nbelow. The grinding disc is driven by means of horizontal and vertical\r\ntoothed wheels, the latter of which is connected with a pulley driven\r\nby power. By means of a screw on the lower part of the plate in which\r\nis the bearing of the axle of the grinding disc, the distance of the\r\nlatter from the lower surface of the hopper can be adjusted. The\r\nprocess begins by adjusting the disc at a considerable distance from\r\nthe hopper. When the paint has once gone through the apparatus the\r\ndisc is raised so that the colour is more finely ground. The ground\r\npaint is returned to the hopper until it is quite uniform.\r\n\r\nThis form of mill can be made in different sizes. Fig. 42 shows the\r\nconstruction of a form for grinding by hand. The actual grinding\r\narrangements are exactly the same as those previously described; the\r\ndifference lies simply in the use of a fly-wheel turned by a handle.\r\nThe illustrations are due to the kindness of W. Sattler of Schweinfurt,\r\nwho makes paint mills as a speciality in different sizes and of\r\nexcellent quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.]\r\n\r\nIn the second form of paint mill the paint is passed between smooth\r\nrollers moving in opposite directions with different speeds, which thus\r\nexert a grinding action in addition to the crushing effect. The two\r\nrollers are provided with cog-wheels with a different number of cogs in\r\norder to give the different speeds.\r\n\r\nIn order that the paint may be sufficiently ground in one operation,\r\nroller mills are made with several pairs of rollers, one above the\r\nother, the lower rollers being somewhat nearer together than the\r\nupper. The paint is fed on to the top pair of rollers, and, after\r\ngoing through these, passes to the next, and finally, after going\r\nbetween all the pairs of rollers, collects in a receiver below in a\r\nfinished condition. By the use of such mills the paints can be ground\r\nsufficiently fine in one operation, if a proper number of rollers is\r\nused. When only two or three pairs are used and the paint is to be very\r\nfinely ground, it must be passed through the whole mill two or three\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMINATION OF PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen an accurate examination of a pigment is required, the only course\r\nis to conduct an exact chemical analysis, which can only be done by an\r\nexpert chemist in a well-equipped laboratory. But often it is necessary\r\nin the course of trade to decide rapidly the nature of a pigment or to\r\ndetect the adulteration of a dear pigment with a cheaper, and for this\r\npurpose it is important to have a method of examination which can be\r\nconducted without much apparatus, and which requires no great chemical\r\nknowledge. It is quite possible to test the majority of pigments in a\r\nsimple manner. Few reagents are necessary. For an examination of the\r\nmineral pigments the following are generally sufficient: hydrochloric,\r\nnitric and sulphuric acids, caustic soda solution and ammonium sulphide.\r\n\r\nThe examination of a pigment containing organic compounds is somewhat\r\nmore difficult, especially when it is necessary to ascertain the\r\nnature of the colouring matter. In this case additional reagents are\r\nrequired—stannous chloride, alum solution, etc.\r\n\r\nSince the present work is intended to meet the requirements of the\r\npractical man, the behaviour of the different pigments towards\r\nordinary reagents is given in tabular form, the pigments of the same\r\ncolour being taken together. Since the colouring matters of organic\r\norigin, as they occur in the lakes, require a rather more detailed\r\nexamination, the testing of pigments composed of inorganic materials\r\nonly is first given, afterwards the properties of the organic colouring\r\nmatters, so far as is necessary, will be added.\r\n\r\n=Mineral Pigments.=—If the substance to be examined is in the form of a\r\ndry powder, it may at once be tested with the reagents mentioned, but\r\nif it is a paint or water colour, the oil or gum must be first removed,\r\notherwise it would not be possible to recognise with certainty the\r\naction of the reagents.\r\n\r\nFrom water colours, which are ground with gum Arabic or tragacanth\r\nsolution, it is easy to separate the pigment from the binding medium.\r\nThe colour is allowed to stand in a tall narrow beaker with a somewhat\r\nlarge quantity of water. After some time the lumps become soft, they\r\nare then repeatedly stirred up, the pigment allowed to deposit, and the\r\nwater, which now contains the binding medium, poured off.\r\n\r\nThe removal of oil from a paint is somewhat more difficult. A quantity\r\nof the paint is placed in a flask with a mixture of equal parts of\r\nstrong alcohol and ether, or with benzine. The flask is lightly corked,\r\nand, after frequent shaking, allowed to stand. The liquids mentioned\r\nare good solvents for oils. After a day or two the pigment will\r\ngenerally have deposited at the bottom of the flask. The solution is\r\nthen poured off, the residue mixed with a small quantity of the solvent\r\nand transferred to a filter, where another small quantity of solvent is\r\npoured over it. The solvent is allowed to drain off, and the residue is\r\ndried. A powder without coherence should be left; this is the pigment\r\nfree from oil. It can be treated like an originally dry colour.\r\n\r\nThe pigments are most conveniently examined in test tubes. If these are\r\nnot at hand the reactions may be carried out on a plate of glass lying\r\non white paper. The powder is placed on the glass and the reagent\r\ndropped on to it from a glass rod dipped in the liquid.\r\n\r\n=Examination with the Blowpipe.=—From the behaviour of pigments at high\r\ntemperatures important conclusions may be drawn as to their nature.\r\nFor this purpose small porcelain crucibles are used; broken pieces of\r\nporcelain or an iron spoon may also be employed. An ordinary spirit\r\nlamp is generally sufficient as a source of heat. In some cases a\r\nhigher temperature is required, which is obtained by means of the\r\nblowpipe.\r\n\r\nThe blowpipe is an invaluable instrument in the examination of mineral\r\npigments. By means of it, almost without reagents, the nature of the\r\npigment can generally be ascertained. The reagents necessary in using\r\nthe blowpipe are soda, borax, and the solution of a cobalt salt.\r\n\r\nThe following method should be observed in examining pigments by means\r\nof the blowpipe. A quantity of the substance, about equal in volume to\r\ntwo grains of rice, is placed in a small hole cut by a knife in a piece\r\nof charcoal, where it is heated by the blowpipe flame. The behaviour\r\nof substances is different in the oxidising and reducing flames of the\r\nblowpipe. When a flame is blown out to a point by means of the blowpipe\r\nit may be seen that the flame consists of two conical portions, one\r\ninside the other. The inner is known as the reducing flame, because\r\nmetallic oxides heated in it produce a bead of metal, or, as the change\r\nis chemically expressed, are reduced to metal. The outer cone has the\r\nopposite properties; metals melted in it are quickly changed into\r\noxides by the action of the oxygen of the air, which has unrestricted\r\naccess. In examining a pigment with the blowpipe the reducing flame\r\nis first used. The nature of the bead of metal, such as is readily\r\nobtained from lead pigments, often allows the composition of the\r\nsubstance to be recognised with certainty. If the behaviour of the bead\r\nof metal is not conclusive it is further heated in the oxidising flame.\r\nThe metal is thus converted into oxide, which deposits on the charcoal,\r\nand by its colour and volatility or want of volatility enables the\r\nmetal contained in the pigment to be determined.\r\n\r\nA solution of cobalt nitrate or chloride is used in testing for certain\r\nmetallic oxides. The substances are moistened with a very dilute\r\nsolution of one of these substances before heating. After they have\r\nbeen heated they show characteristic colours if certain oxides are\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nSeveral metallic oxides give a characteristic colour when fused with\r\nborax. For this purpose a small loop is made at the end of a thin\r\nplatinum wire; this is moistened and dipped in powdered anhydrous\r\nborax. On heating in the blowpipe flame the borax adhering to the wire\r\nmelts to a colourless glass. In testing a pigment the transparent\r\nbead of borax is then dipped into the powder, and again fused in the\r\nblowpipe flame. It is of great importance in this test to fuse but a\r\nvery small quantity of material in the borax bead; some metallic oxides\r\nhave such great colouring power that, when too much is used, the bead\r\nappears quite black, so that its colour cannot be recognised.\r\n\r\n\r\nREACTIONS OF THE WHITE PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n_On Heating on Charcoal_:—Lead pigments give a lead bead in the\r\nreducing flame, which is converted in the oxidising flame to lead\r\noxide, forming a deposit on the charcoal surrounding the hole.\r\n\r\nAntimony white gives a brittle metallic bead in the reducing flame.\r\nThis burns in the oxidising flame with the evolution of white vapours,\r\nand is at the same time covered by small shining crystals.\r\n\r\nBismuth white in the oxidising flame gives a rainbow-coloured\r\nincrustation spreading far over the charcoal.\r\n\r\nTin white gives a malleable metallic bead, converted by nitric acid\r\ninto a white powder.\r\n\r\nZinc white is converted into a green mass when moistened with cobalt\r\nsolution and heated in the oxidising flame.\r\n\r\nThe more expensive white pigments are frequently mixed with cheaper\r\nsubstances, _e.g._, white lead with finely powdered barytes, chalk or\r\ngypsum. Such admixture is distinctly to be regarded as adulteration,\r\nsince the added substances have not the covering power of white lead.\r\nIn the case of coloured pigments an addition of a white material is not\r\nto be regarded as adulteration, since the addition is made in order to\r\nimpart a paler shade to the colour.\r\n\r\n

Charcoal_:—Lead brown gives a lead bead in the reducing\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nManganese brown and pyrolusite brown, when fused with saltpetre on\r\nplatinum foil at a high temperature, give a bluish-green mass.\r\n\r\nPrussian brown and iron brown give a pale green borax bead in the\r\nreducing flame, which turns yellowish brown in the oxidising flame.\r\n\r\nChrome brown heated, moistened with hydrochloric acid, and again\r\nheated, colours the flame green. It also gives a green borax bead.\r\n\r\nCobalt brown produces a blue borax bead.\r\n\r\nHumin substances burn when heated on charcoal.\r\n\r\n\r\nREACTIONS OF THE BLACK PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\nAlmost all black pigments consist of carbon, upon which reagents have\r\nno action. They should be at once heated on charcoal. If they burn\r\naway completely in the oxidising flame they consist of lamp black or\r\ncarbon obtained by some process of incomplete combustion; if a white,\r\ninfusible residue is left, the pigment is bone (ivory) black; if the\r\nresidue is black the substance under examination must be ”neutral\r\ntint,” chrome black, or chrome-copper black. The two former give a pale\r\ngreen borax bead, whilst chrome-copper black gives a deep green bead,\r\nand when heated, moistened with hydrochloric acid, and again heated, it\r\ncolours the flame green.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF LAKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn examining lakes it is necessary to ascertain the nature of the\r\norganic colouring matter, the base with which this is united, and\r\nalso the nature of the substances mechanically mixed with the lake to\r\nlighten its shade.\r\n\r\nIt is most convenient to examine the pigment first for mechanical\r\nadmixtures. If an effervescence follows the addition of hydrochloric\r\nacid, denoting the presence of a carbonate, this is generally calcium\r\ncarbonate. White lead is rarely used, since it is very heavy and is\r\nmore expensive. Gypsum and magnesia are occasionally added to lakes;\r\nthey are recognised by examining the residue left on ignition.\r\n\r\nIn testing for the metallic oxide which is united with the colouring\r\nmatter a small quantity of the lake is heated in a little porcelain\r\ncrucible until all organic substances are completely destroyed. The\r\nresidue is then examined for aluminium and tin oxides, by means of\r\nwhich lakes are most frequently prepared.\r\n\r\n         REACTIONS OF THE ORGANIC COLOURING MATTERS.\r\n

colouring matter is united with the\r\nmetallic oxide, because the organic colouring matters do not give,\r\nas a rule, decided reactions. In examining pigments of this kind\r\nit is always advisable to test at the same time a pigment of known\r\ncomposition, and to compare the reactions of the two. The colouring\r\nmatter of the lake is first brought into solution. This is accomplished\r\nby the action of dilute hydrochloric acid, which decomposes the\r\ncompound of metallic oxide and colouring matter, the latter dissolving.\r\nA portion of the lake should remain undecomposed, so that the solution\r\nhas no strong acid reaction by which the action of the reagents to be\r\nused would be modified. When the lake has been treated for some time\r\nwith dilute hydrochloric acid, water is added and the solution of the\r\ncolouring matter filtered from the residue. Small quantities of this\r\nsolution are then treated with the different reagents. By a comparison\r\nof the reactions given by the solution and by a solution of the pure\r\ncolouring matter, the nature of the colouring matter under examination\r\nmay be decided.\r\n\r\nIn deciding in the first place if a colour is of organic origin, it\r\nis treated with hydrochloric acid in the above manner. If a coloured\r\nsolution results, an organic colour is probably present. Chlorine water\r\nis then added to a portion of the solution; if the latter is quickly\r\ndecolourised an organic colouring matter is certainly present, for they\r\nare all decomposed by the continued action of chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe following reagents are used in testing organic colouring matters:\r\ndilute sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, caustic soda solution or lime\r\nwater, strong nitric acid, which, in consequence of its oxidising\r\nproperties, gives different reactions to the other acids. Of the\r\nmetallic salts, alum, stannous chloride and ferric chloride are used,\r\nand occasionally copper acetate. Glue solution is also used in the pure\r\nform of isinglass or gelatine solution, with which several colouring\r\nmatters give characteristic precipitates. The foregoing tables give the\r\nbehaviour of the colouring matters contained in the organic pigments\r\ntowards the reagents mentioned above.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nTHE TESTING OF DYE-WOODS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of pigments from dye-woods or other organic\r\nsubstances, the value of the raw material is in proportion to the\r\namount of colouring matter it contains, other things being equal. It\r\nis specially desirable to estimate accurately the colouring matter in\r\nexpensive materials such as indigo and cochineal.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of methods which permit an accurate estimation\r\nof the indigo blue in indigo. One good process is founded upon the\r\ndecomposition of indigo blue by chlorine, when the colour of the\r\nsolution changes from blue to yellow. Since a definite amount of\r\nchlorine is required to decompose indigo blue, from the quantity of\r\nchlorine required by a sample of indigo, its content in indigo blue can\r\nbe ascertained.\r\n\r\nWhilst the percentage of indigo blue contained in indigo can be\r\nfound with tolerable accuracy, though by a rather elaborate process\r\nrequiring special apparatus, there is no convenient method for\r\nexamining the other organic colour materials by which their content\r\nin active constituents can be readily found. In practice a process is\r\nparticularly valuable which requires little time and no complicated\r\napparatus. Colouring materials can be rapidly tested by a physical\r\nprocess which requires little time and an inexpensive apparatus. Under\r\nsimilar conditions the extract of a dye-wood is deeper in colour in\r\nproportion to the colouring matter it contains. If therefore the\r\nintensity of the colour of the extract can be accurately measured,\r\nthere is no difficulty in drawing a certain conclusion as to the amount\r\nof colouring matter in the raw material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.]\r\n\r\n=The Colorimeter= is the apparatus adapted for the purpose in question.\r\nThere are many forms of colorimeter. The instrument devised by Dubosq\r\nis distinguished by simplicity and accuracy of results before other\r\napparatus of similar construction. Dubosq’s colorimeter consists of the\r\nfollowing parts (Fig. 43): two glass cylinders, C and C₁, the bottoms\r\nof which must be perfectly plane both inside and outside (the accuracy\r\nof the results depends upon this), stand upon a sheet of plate glass.\r\nTwo glass cylinders of smaller diameter, T and T₁, are suspended in C\r\nand C₁. The bottoms of these cylinders must also be quite plane. It\r\nwould be very expensive to make glass cylinders of this kind in one\r\npiece. The same result is obtained by providing each cylinder with\r\na metal ring upon which screws another ring in which is cemented a\r\ncircular piece of plate glass.\r\n\r\nLight should only reach the eye of the observer in a direction parallel\r\nwith the axis of the cylinders. C and C₁ are therefore blackened on\r\nthe outside. The inner cylinders, T and T₁, are fastened to racks\r\nmoving vertically. The distance through which the cylinder is moved\r\nis measured by a scale on one of the racks. Above the cylinders T and\r\nT₁ are Fresnel’s prisms. Below C and C₁ is a mirror, S, which can be\r\nadjusted to throw light vertically upwards. Beams of light pass through\r\nthe plate glass and the bottoms of the cylinders C and T, C₁ and T₁,\r\nunrefracted, they are then deviated by the Fresnel’s prisms so that the\r\nobserver looking down through the telescope, F, has a circular field of\r\nview, one half of which is illuminated by the light passing through the\r\ncylinder C, and the other by the beam passing through C₁. The intensity\r\nof the light which has passed through the two cylinders can thus be\r\naccurately compared.\r\n\r\nIn order to use this apparatus to compare the intensity of colour of\r\ntwo liquids, the following process is performed: A liquid is made,\r\nthe colour intensity of which is taken as 100. The colour intensity\r\nof the liquid under examination will then be represented by a number\r\nindicating the relation between its intensity and that of the standard\r\nliquid. A solution of caramel in water is generally used as the\r\nstandard, since this substance has very great intensity of colour.\r\nThe preparation of absolutely pure caramel is difficult, and it is\r\ntherefore advisable, in order always to have the standard solution of\r\nthe same intensity, to prepare a large quantity of caramel solution at\r\nonce, to add carbolic acid to prevent it from decomposing, and to keep\r\nit in well-closed bottles. When the standard solution is almost used\r\nup the colorimeter is employed to prepare a fresh quantity of equal\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\nTo render possible an exact comparison of two substances they\r\nmust be tested under the same conditions, that is, the solutions\r\nof the colouring matters must be made in exactly the same manner.\r\nFinely-powdered materials dissolve more readily than coarse powders. In\r\nmaking the solutions which are to be examined for intensity of colour,\r\nthe raw materials must be brought into a condition of fine division\r\nby the same instrument, for example, a rasp. The colour solution is\r\nmade by boiling 100 grammes of the dye-wood with exactly a litre of\r\ndistilled water for precisely thirty minutes. The liquid is then\r\nfiltered into a 1-litre flask. The dye-wood absorbs water, and some is\r\nlost by evaporation, so that considerably less than 1 litre of liquid\r\nis collected in the flask. Distilled water is added to make up the\r\nvolume to 1 litre.\r\n\r\nIf two samples of logwood are treated in this manner, solutions are\r\nobtained which contain the colouring matter in the same proportions\r\nin which it exists in the two samples. The intensity of colour of the\r\nsolutions is then estimated in the following manner: The cylinder C is\r\nfilled with the standard caramel solution up to a mark on the outside\r\nof the cylinder. The cylinder C₁ is filled with the decoction to the\r\nsame height. The distance between the bottoms of the cylinders, R and\r\nT, R₁ and T₁, must be made smaller in proportion to the intensity of\r\ncolour of the liquid between them. If now the amount of light which\r\npenetrates a layer of caramel solution of a certain thickness be taken\r\nas unity, the depth of a layer of the decoction must be greater, the\r\nsmaller the quantity of colouring matter it contains, in order that\r\nthe two halves of the field of view may be equally illuminated. The\r\ncylinder T₁ must be raised to a greater height the smaller the quantity\r\nof colouring matter in the liquid, in order that the two halves of\r\nthe field may be illuminated to the same extent. If the colouring\r\npower of the caramel solution is taken as 100, the colouring power of\r\nthe decoction can be readily calculated from the height to which the\r\ncylinder, T₁, is raised. The heights of the layers of liquid between\r\nthe bottoms of the cylinders C and T, C₁ and T₁, are inversely as the\r\nquantities of colouring matter contained in the respective cylinders.\r\n\r\nWhen caramel solution is used as the standard the intensity of the\r\nlight in the two halves of the field can be judged, but not the\r\nintensity of colour. In order to estimate the latter a solution of that\r\ncolouring matter must be used as a standard which is the principal\r\nconstituent of the decoction under examination. Thus, in a careful\r\nexamination of logwood a solution of hæmatoxylin would be used, and\r\nin the examination of red wood a solution of pure brasilin, as the\r\nstandard. In this case a saturated solution of the colouring matter\r\nwould be taken as the standard. If the intensity of its colour were\r\nrepresented by 100, the colour intensity of the wood under examination\r\nwould always be less than 100, and would, with tolerable accuracy,\r\nrepresent the percentage of colouring matter in the wood. The result\r\nwould not be quite accurate, because the dye-wood contains other\r\nsubstances which dissolve in water on boiling and affect the colour of\r\nthe decoction, but the results are of such accuracy that for practical\r\npurposes no material mistake will be made by taking them as percentages\r\nof colouring matter.\r\n\r\nAlthough at first sight the estimation of the colouring matter in a\r\ndye-wood by means of the colorimeter appears somewhat complicated,\r\nyet it yields the most accurate results with the smallest expenditure\r\nof labour and time. The value of a colouring material may also be\r\nestimated by preparing the pure colouring matter from a weighed\r\nquantity. This process is lengthy, demands considerable practice, and\r\nonly gives good results when it is carried out with the most painful\r\naccuracy. The colouring matters in question are precipitated by lead\r\nsalts. If the dye-wood extract contained colouring matter alone its\r\namount could be found by observing the volume of a lead solution of\r\nknown strength required to precipitate the colouring matter completely.\r\nThe decoctions, however, contain other substances which form lead\r\ncompounds, and are precipitated together with the colouring matter, so\r\nthat if the precipitate were regarded as the pure lead compound of the\r\ncolouring matter a very inaccurate result would be obtained. In order\r\nto obtain results with some pretensions to accuracy the lead compound\r\nof the colouring matter must be purified. The impure precipitate is\r\nwashed and suspended in water, through which sulphuretted hydrogen is\r\npassed until all the lead is precipitated as lead sulphide, which is\r\nfiltered off, excess of sulphuretted hydrogen expelled by boiling,\r\nand the solution again precipitated by a lead salt. This precipitate\r\nmay be regarded without considerable error as the lead compound of\r\nthe colouring matter. The weight of colouring matter contained in the\r\nquantity of wood used can be calculated from the weight of the dry\r\nprecipitate. This method is somewhat complicated and tedious; the\r\nresults are inferior in accuracy to those obtained by means of the\r\ncolorimeter, which instrument furnishes the most suitable method for\r\ntesting dye-woods for practical purposes.\r\n\r\nA thorough knowledge of chemistry is indispensable to the colour\r\nmanufacturer who wishes to carry on his business on any extensive\r\nscale. It enables him to match any sample of colour submitted to him\r\nand to test his raw materials with ease. We have indeed given in a\r\nsection of this book simple methods by which the majority of commercial\r\npigments can be tested with tolerable accuracy by means of a few\r\nreagents, and for ordinary purposes these methods are sufficient. But\r\nwhen an accurate examination of a pigment is required, it must be\r\nconducted by the ordinary processes of analytical chemistry. The colour\r\nmanufacturer has not only to carry out these occasional examinations,\r\nbut has frequently to test certain raw materials which he uses in\r\nlarge quantities. Soda may be taken as an example. An estimation of\r\nthe percentage of sodium carbonate in this substance is an exceedingly\r\nsimple matter to the chemist, but can hardly be carried out without a\r\nknowledge of chemistry.\r\n\r\nA manufacturer without chemical knowledge, who is carrying on an\r\nindustry which, like the manufacture of colours, rests entirely upon a\r\nchemical foundation, will constantly be compelled to seek advice from\r\na scientific chemist. Many pigments can be made according to a settled\r\nformula, but the results of working strictly according to the formula,\r\nwithout a knowledge of the reasons for the operations, can only be\r\nsatisfactory whilst no irregularity occurs. The least irregularity\r\nplaces those who work blindly in a completely helpless position, for\r\nthey do not know what is wrong and cannot remove the hindrance.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of pigments certain by-products are produced. These\r\ncan be utilised by a manufacturer possessed of chemical knowledge,\r\nwhilst they are simply thrown away by many, thus making the manufacture\r\nof the particular pigment far more expensive than when the by-product\r\nis also made valuable. Strictly speaking, there are no worthless\r\nby-products in making pigments, every liquid obtained in precipitating\r\na colour might be further utilised. Salt solutions can only be\r\nregarded as worthless by-products when the cost of separating the salt\r\nfrom the solution would be greater than the value of the product. Thus\r\nwe cannot conclude this section of the work without again insisting\r\nthat the study of chemistry is indispensable to the colour maker, since\r\nhis industry is chemical from beginning to end. The colour maker who\r\nworks simply by recipes will never raise himself above the position of\r\nan ordinary workman, who does what he is told without thinking of what\r\nhe is doing. The smallest mistake in carrying out the process generally\r\nresults in the complete failure of the whole operation and thus causes\r\nthe manufacturer material loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE DESIGN OF A COLOUR WORKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the establishment of a colour works several conditions are\r\nnecessary. The most important is the supply of water in sufficient\r\nquantity and purity. It has already been stated that many pigments\r\ncannot be made with water containing much organic matter or salts,\r\nsince the dissolved substances affect the shade. This action not only\r\ntakes place in the formation of the colour, but is also unpleasantly\r\nmanifest when it is washed. The delicate lakes are discoloured by\r\norganic matter in the water, and are so changed by any considerable\r\nquantity of lime that the alteration in shade is clearly perceptible\r\nafter continued treatment. If the water contains but a very small\r\nquantity of iron, the preparation of some pigments is made quite\r\nimpossible, since—and this is especially the case with the lakes—the\r\nferric oxide is precipitated together with the pigment, and in\r\nconsequence of its characteristic colour imparts to it an ugly shade.\r\nThus in choosing a site for a colour works the available water supply\r\nmust be carefully examined. If it is not sufficiently pure or in\r\nsufficient quantity, the position must be regarded as unsuitable.\r\n\r\nNo colour maker, although working on the largest scale, is in a\r\nposition to make all the materials he requires. With the continual\r\ndevelopment of the chemical industries, the number of these substances\r\nwhich can be made economically in the colour works continually\r\ndiminishes. It is far more advantageous to obtain them from works\r\nin which they are made on the large scale. Many of these substances\r\nare required in large quantity, so that a site should be chosen in\r\ndirect communication with the railway, so that the cost of carriage\r\nis diminished, and also the cost of distributing the manufactured\r\nmaterials. This is especially necessary for materials which have a low\r\nvalue and consequently can bear no high cost of carriage.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the space required by a colour works, no actual dimensions\r\ncan be given, since these vary with the extent of the business, and\r\nwith the pigments produced. In the price lists of large colour works\r\nall the commercial pigments are generally quoted, but they are rarely\r\nif ever actually made in one works, but are obtained at a lower price\r\nfrom other establishments, which make a speciality of certain pigments,\r\nand by working on a large scale can produce them at such a cost that\r\nthe smaller manufacturer is not in a position to compete with them.\r\nThus there are works in which only white lead or ultramarine is made.\r\n\r\nIf a colour manufacturer is in the fortunate position of placing his\r\nworks on a river, he has not only an unrestricted water supply, but may\r\nalso be able to use water power, the cheapest of all powers. When water\r\npower is available, it will be used to raise the large volumes of water\r\nrequired and to move the machinery for grinding the raw materials,\r\nrasping dye-woods, etc. In a colour works of any size a boiler is\r\nrequired; if water power is not used, it must be of sufficient power to\r\ngive steam for driving the engine, for boiling liquids and for heating\r\nthe drying stoves. The boiler is of great advantage in providing steam\r\nfor dissolving salts, extracting dye-woods and boiling liquids. When\r\nliquids are boiled by steam there is considerable economy in that the\r\nmajority of the boiling tubs can be of wood, which is provided with\r\na protective coating for liquids which attack wood. Thus there is\r\neconomy in dispensing with large metal pans and with the fireplaces\r\nin which they would be built, and also in the course of time there is\r\nconsiderable saving in fuel.\r\n\r\nFor a well-equipped colour works a drying stove, in which the pigments\r\ncan be thoroughly dried, is important. It is most convenient to heat\r\ndrying stoves with steam. The temperature can be easily regulated by\r\nincreasing or diminishing the supply of steam. For drying pigments\r\nwhich would not be injured by considerable increase of temperature, the\r\ndrying stove may be heated by a fire.\r\n\r\nIn a colour works in which many pigments are made sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nis frequently required. Since all lead pigments are blackened by this\r\ngas, the greatest care is required in using it. Also the poisonous\r\nnature of sulphuretted hydrogen is generally under-estimated. In\r\nworking with sulphuretted hydrogen, the apparatus depicted in Fig. 3\r\nshould be used. It should be placed in a position, such as a closed\r\nyard, in which escaping gas will be harmless. If this cannot be done\r\nthe precipitation should be accomplished in closed vessels, from which\r\na pipe should carry the gas to a fire, where it will be burnt to\r\nsulphur dioxide and water.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the manufacturer of colours makes but a certain number\r\nof pigments and rarely or never all which are mentioned in his price\r\nlists. The dimensions of the establishment will be in accordance. In\r\ncommencing a new colour works it is advisable from purely financial\r\nreasons to produce at first a limited number of colours, but these\r\nin perfection. By many experiments and diligent study of chemistry a\r\ncolour manufacturer may hope to compete successfully in so difficult a\r\nbranch of chemical technology as the manufacture of colours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\nCOMMERCIAL NAMES OF PIGMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn commerce the pigments are found under the most different names, the\r\nmost common of which have been given together with the description\r\nof the pigment. No regularity can be found in the names chosen for\r\nthe different pigments; quite arbitrary designations have been taken.\r\nPigments are most commonly named after places—for example, Prussian\r\nblue, Paris blue, Bremen green; also after the discoverer—Turnbull’s\r\nblue, Hatchett brown. Whilst these names give the place of production\r\nor the name of the discoverer, and thus have some foundation, there are\r\nmany others for which no reason can be assigned, _e.g._, King’s yellow.\r\nCertain names are based upon the chemical composition of the pigment.\r\nThese should be used by preference, but now that the expressions white\r\nlead, chrome yellow and Chinese blue have become common no one would\r\nthink of speaking of basic lead carbonate, lead chromate or ferric\r\nferrocyanide. The confusion in the nomenclature of colours is increased\r\nby placing pigments which possess English names upon the market under\r\nFrench, German or Latin names, which are often sadly mutilated. This is\r\nmore the case in Germany than in England.\r\n\r\nIt may easily happen that a reader of a work on colour making might\r\nsearch in vain for a pigment whose name he had somewhere heard, whilst\r\nthe book contained a description of the colour and its properties,\r\nbut under another name. To remove this difficulty it has been thought\r\nnecessary to collect the names of the different pigments, which are\r\ncontained in the following table. The French and German names are also\r\ngiven.
