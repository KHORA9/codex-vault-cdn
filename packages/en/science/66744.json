The scalpel of the\r\nexperts has made us acquainted with his organic structure; but no\r\nobserver, as far as I know, has thought of interviewing him, with any\r\nsort of persistence, on the subject of his private habits. Ripped up,\r\nafter being steeped in spirits of wine, he is very well-known; acting\r\nwithin the domain of his instincts, he is hardly known at all. And yet\r\nnone of the segmented animals is more deserving of a detailed\r\nbiography. He has at all times appealed to the popular imagination,\r\neven to the point of figuring among the signs of the zodiac. Fear made\r\nthe gods, said Lucretius. Deified by terror, the Scorpion is\r\nimmortalized in the sky by a constellation and in the almanac by the\r\nsymbol for the month of October.\r\n\r\nI made the acquaintance of the Languedocian Scorpion (Scorpio\r\noccitanus, LAT) half a century ago, in the Villeneuve hills, on the far\r\nside of the Rhone, opposite Avignon. When the thrice-blessed Thursday\r\n[1] came, from morning till night I used to turn over the stones in\r\nquest of the Scolopendra, [2] the chief subject of the thesis which I\r\nwas preparing for my doctor’s degree. Sometimes, instead of that\r\nmagnificent horror, the mighty Myriapod, I would find, under the raised\r\nstone, another and no less unpleasant recluse. It was he. With his tail\r\nturned over his back and a drop of poison gleaming at the end of the\r\nsting, he lay displaying his pincers at the entrance to a burrow.\r\nBr-r-r-r! Have done with the formidable creature! The stone fell back\r\ninto its place.\r\n\r\nUtterly tired out, I used to return from my excursions rich in\r\nScolopendræ and richer still in those illusions which paint the future\r\nrose-colour when we first begin to bite freely into the bread of\r\nknowledge. Science! The witch! I used to come home with joy in my\r\nheart: I had found some Centipedes. What more was needed to complete my\r\ningenuous happiness? I carried off the Scolopendræ and left the\r\nScorpions behind, not without a secret feeling that a day would come\r\nwhen I should have to concern myself with them.\r\n\r\nFifty years have elapsed; and that day has come. It behoves me, after\r\nthe Spiders, [3] his near neighbours in organization, to cross-examine\r\nmy old acquaintance, chief of the Arachnids in our district. It so\r\nhappens that the Languedocian Scorpion abounds in my neighbourhood;\r\nnowhere have I seen him so plentiful as on the Sérignan hills, with\r\ntheir sunny, rocky slopes beloved by the arbutus and the arborescent\r\nheath. There the chilly creature finds a sub-tropical temperature and\r\nalso a sandy soil, easy to dig. This is, I think, as far as he goes\r\ntowards the north.\r\n\r\nHis favourite spots are the bare expanses poor in vegetation, where the\r\nrock, outcropping in vertical strata, is baked by the sun and worn by\r\nthe wind and rain until it ends by crumbling into flakes. He is usually\r\nfound in colonies at quite a distance from one another, as though the\r\nmembers of a single family, migrating in all directions, were becoming\r\na tribe. It is not sociability, it is anything but that. Excessively\r\nintolerant and passionately devoted to solitude, they continually\r\noccupy their shelters alone. In vain do I seek them out: I never find\r\ntwo of them under the same stone; or, to be more accurate, when there\r\nare two, one is engaged in eating the other. We shall have occasion to\r\nsee the savage hermit ending the nuptial festivities in this fashion.\r\n\r\nThe lodging is very rough and ready. Let us turn over the stones, which\r\nare generally flat and fairly large. The Scorpion’s presence is\r\nindicated by a cavity as wide as the neck of a quart bottle and a few\r\ninches deep. In stooping, we commonly see the master of the house on\r\nthe threshold of his dwelling, with his pincers outspread and his tail\r\nin the posture of defence. At other times, when he owns a deeper cell,\r\nthe hermit is invisible. We have to use a small pocket-trowel to bring\r\nhim out into the light of day. Here he is, lifting or brandishing his\r\nweapon. ’Ware fingers!\r\n\r\nI take him by the tail with a pair of tweezers and slip him, head\r\nforemost, into a stout paper bag, which will isolate him from the other\r\nprisoners. The whole of my formidable harvest goes into a tin box. In\r\nthis way both the collecting and the transport are carried out with\r\nperfect safety.\r\n\r\nBefore housing my animals, let me briefly describe them. The common\r\nBlack Scorpion (Scorpio europæus, LINN.) is known to all. He frequents\r\nthe dark holes and corners near our dwelling-places; on rainy days in\r\nautumn he makes his way indoors, sometimes even under our bed-clothes.\r\nThe odious animal causes us more fright than damage. Although not rare\r\nin my present abode, the results of its visits are never in the least\r\nserious. The weird beast, overrated in reputation, is repulsive rather\r\nthan dangerous.\r\n\r\nMuch more to be feared and much less well-known generally is the\r\nLanguedocian Scorpion, resident in the Mediterranean provinces. Far\r\nfrom seeking our habitations, he lives apart, in the untilled\r\nsolitudes. Beside the Black Scorpion he is a giant who, when\r\nfull-grown, measures three to three and a half inches in length. His\r\ncolouring is the yellow of faded straw.\r\n\r\nThe tail, which is really the animal’s abdomen, is a series of five\r\nprismatic segments, shaped like little kegs whose staves meet in\r\nundulating ridges resembling strings of beads. Similar cords cover the\r\narms and fore-arms of the nippers and divide them into long facets.\r\nOthers meander along the back like the joints of a cuirass whose seams\r\nare adorned with a freakish milled edging. These bead-like\r\nprotuberances give the Scorpion’s armour a fierce and robustious\r\nappearance which is characteristic of the Languedocian Scorpion. It is\r\nas though the animal were fashioned out of chips hewn with an adze.\r\n\r\nThe tail ends in a sixth joint, which is smooth and vesicular. This is\r\nthe gourd in which the poison, a formidable fluid resembling water in\r\nappearance, is elaborated and held in reserve. A dark, curved and very\r\nsharp sting completes the apparatus. A pore, visible only under the\r\nlens, opens at some distance from the point. Through this the venomous\r\nliquid is injected into the puncture. The sting is very hard and very\r\nsharp. Holding it between my finger-tips, I can push it through a sheet\r\nof cardboard as easily as if I were using a needle.\r\n\r\nOwing to its bold curve, the sting points downwards when the tail is\r\nextended in a straight line. To make use of his weapon, therefore, the\r\nScorpion must raise it, turn it over and strike upwards. This, in fact,\r\nis his invariable practice. In order to pink the adversary subdued by\r\nthe nippers, the tail is arched over the animal’s back and brought\r\nforward. The Scorpion, for that matter, is almost always in this\r\nposition: whether in motion or at rest, he arches his tail over his\r\nback. He very rarely drags it behind him, relaxed into a straight line.\r\n\r\nThe pincers, those buccal hands recalling the claws of the Crayfish,\r\nare organs of battle and of information. When moving forwards, the\r\nScorpion holds them in front of him, with the two fingers opened, to\r\ntake stock of objects encountered on the way. When he wants to stab an\r\nenemy, the pincers seize the foe and hold him motionless, while the\r\nsting is brought into play over the assailant’s back. Lastly, when he\r\nwishes to nibble a tit-bit at leisure, they serve as hands and hold the\r\nprey within the reach of the mouth. They are never used for walking,\r\nfor stability or for excavation.\r\n\r\nThat is the function of the real legs. These are suddenly truncated and\r\nend in a group of short, movable claws, faced by a short, fine point,\r\nwhich, to some extent, serves as a thumb. The stump is finished off\r\nwith rough bristles. The whole constitutes an excellent grapnel, which\r\nexplains the Scorpion’s aptitude for roaming over the trellis-work of\r\nmy wire-gauze covers, for making long halts there, motionless and\r\nupside down, and, lastly, for scrambling along a vertical wall,\r\nnotwithstanding his clumsiness and weight.\r\n\r\nUnderneath, just behind the legs, are the combs, those strange organs,\r\nan exclusive attribute of the Scorpions. They owe their name to their\r\nstructure, consisting of a long row of plates, set close together like\r\nthe teeth of a hair-comb. The anatomists are inclined to ascribe to\r\nthem the functions of a clutch intended to hold the couple bound\r\ntogether at the moment of pairing. We will leave it at that until we\r\nare better informed, provided that the specimens which I propose to\r\nrear tell me their secret.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I know of another function, which is very easily\r\nobserved when the Scorpion meanders, belly uppermost, over the wire\r\ntrellis of my dish-covers. When he is at rest, the two combs are laid\r\nflat on the abdomen, behind the legs. The moment he begins to walk,\r\nthey stick out on either side, at right angles to the body, like the\r\nnaked wings of an unfledged nestling. They sway gently up and down,\r\nreminding us of the balancing-pole of an inexperienced rope-dancer. [4]\r\nIf the Scorpion stops, they are at once retracted, fall back upon the\r\nbelly and cease to move: if he resumes his walk, they are at once\r\nextended and again begin their gentle oscillation. The animal therefore\r\nseems to use them at least as a balancing mechanism.\r\n\r\nThe eyes, eight in number, are divided into three groups. In the middle\r\nof that weird segment which is at once head and thorax, two large and\r\nvery convex eyes gleam side by side, reminding us of the Lycosa’s [5]\r\nsuperb lenses; they are apparently in both instances for use at close\r\nrange, because of their great convexity. A ridge of protuberances\r\narranged in a wavy line serves as an eyebrow and gives them a fierce\r\nappearance. Their axis, which is almost horizontal, can hardly allow\r\nthem more than lateral vision.\r\n\r\nThe same remark applies to two other groups, each composed of three\r\neyes, which are very small and placed much farther forward, nearly on\r\nthe edge of the sudden truncation that forms an arch above the mouth.\r\nOn both right and left the three tiny lenses are set in a short\r\nstraight line, their axis pointing laterally. On the whole, both the\r\nsmall and the large eyes are so arranged that it can by no means be\r\neasy for the animal to obtain a clear view ahead.\r\n\r\nExtremely short-sighted and squinting outrageously, how does the\r\nScorpion manage to steer himself? Like a blind man, he gropes his way:\r\nhe guides himself with his hands, that is to say, his pincers, which he\r\ncarries outstretched, with the fingers open, to sound the space before\r\nhim. Watch two Scorpions wandering in the open air in my rearing-cages.\r\nA meeting would be disagreeable, sometimes even dangerous for them.\r\nNevertheless, the one behind always goes ahead as though he did not\r\nperceive his neighbour; but, as soon as he touches the other ever so\r\nlittle with his pincers, he at once gives a sudden start, a sign of\r\nsurprise and uneasiness, followed at once by a retreat and a change of\r\ndirection. To recognize the irascible one thus overhauled, he had to\r\ntouch him.\r\n\r\nLet us now instal our prisoners. I shall never learn all I want to know\r\nby turning over stones and making chance observations on the adjacent\r\nhills: I must resort to keeping the animals in captivity, the only\r\nmanner of inducing them to reveal their domestic habits. What\r\nrearing-method shall I employ? One in particular appeals to me, one\r\nwhich will leave the creature its full liberty, which will relieve me\r\nof the cares of catering and which will enable me to inspect my\r\ncaptives at any hour of the day, from year’s end to year’s end. This\r\nseems to me an excellent means, far superior to the others, so much so\r\nthat I reckon on a magnificent success.\r\n\r\nIt is a question of establishing within my own grounds, in the open\r\nair, a hamlet of Scorpions, by cunning securing for them the same\r\nconditions of well-being which they enjoyed at home. In the first days\r\nof January, I found my colony right at the end of the harmas, [6]  in\r\nthe quiet corner exposed to the sun and sheltered from the north wind\r\nby a thick rosemary-hedge. The ground, a mixture of pebbles and red\r\nclayey soil, is unsuitable. Considering the temperament of my charges,\r\ngreat stay-at-homes from what I can see, this is easily remedied. For\r\neach of my colonists I dig a hole, of a gallon or two in capacity, and\r\nfill it with sandy earth similar to that of the original site. I pack\r\nthis earth lightly, which will give it the consistence needed for\r\ndigging without land-slips, and in it I contrived a short\r\nentrance-passage, the beginning of the excavation which the Scorpion\r\nwill not fail to make in order to obtain a cell in conformity with his\r\ntastes. A wide flat stone covers and overlaps the whole. Opposite the\r\npassage of my own making, I scoop out a hollow: this is the\r\nentrance-door.\r\n\r\nIn front of the hollow I place a Scorpion, taken that moment from the\r\npaper bag in which he has just been conveyed from the mountain. Seeing\r\na retreat similar to those with which he is familiar, he goes in of his\r\nown accord and does not show himself again. In this way I establish the\r\nhamlet, consisting of some twenty inhabitants, all adults. The\r\ndwellings, placed at a suitable distance from one another, to avoid the\r\nquarrels liable to occur among neighbours, are arranged in a row on a\r\nstretch of ground cleared with the rake. It will be easy for me to\r\nobserve events at a glance, even at night, by the light of a lantern.\r\nAs to food, I need not trouble about that. My guests will find their\r\nown provisions, for the spot is quite as well-stocked with game as that\r\nfrom which I brought them.\r\n\r\nThe colonies in the paddock are not enough. Certain observations call\r\nfor minute attention which is incompatible with the disturbances out of\r\ndoors. A second menagerie is set up, this time on the large table in my\r\nstudy, a table around which I have already covered and am still\r\ncovering so many miles in pursuit of stubborn knowledge. Bring up the\r\nbig earthenware pans, my usual apparatus! Filled with sifted sandy\r\nearth, each receives two broad potsherds, which, half buried, form a\r\nceiling and represent the refuge under the stones. The establishment is\r\nsurrounded by the dome of a wire-gauze cover.\r\n\r\nHere I house the Scorpions, two by two and of different sexes, as far\r\nas I am able to judge. No outward characteristic that I know of\r\ndistinguishes the males from the females. I take the big bellied\r\nspecimens for females and the less obese for males. As age intervenes\r\nwith its variations of stoutness, mistakes are inevitable, unless I\r\nfirst open the subject’s paunch, a procedure which would cut short any\r\nattempt at rearing. We will allow ourselves to be guided by size, since\r\nwe have no other means of judging, and house the Scorpions two by two,\r\none corpulent and brown, the other less obese and of a lighter colour.\r\nThere are certain to be some actual couples among the number.\r\n\r\nHere are a few details for the benefit of whoso may care one day to\r\ntake up similar studies. An animal-breeder’s trade calls for\r\napprenticeship; the experience of others is not unhelpful, especially\r\nwhen the animals in question are dangerous to deal with. It would never\r\ndo inadvertently to lay a hand on one of my present prisoners who had\r\nescaped from his cage and lay skulking among the utensils littering the\r\ntable. Serious precautions must be taken by those who propose to spend\r\nwhole years in the company of such neighbours. They are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe trellis-work dome is fitted deep into the pan and touches the\r\nearthenware bottom. Between the two there is a circular space which I\r\nfill with clay soil, packed while wet. So fitted, the wire cover is\r\nquite immovable; the apparatus runs no risk of coming to pieces and\r\nyielding a way of escape. On the other hand, if the Scorpions dig\r\ndeeply on the edges of the earthy space at their disposal, they come\r\nupon either the wire-gauze or the pottery, both of which are\r\ninsuperable obstacles. So we need have no fear of escape.\r\n\r\nBut this is not enough. While we have to see to our own safety, we must\r\nalso think of the captives’ welfare. The dwelling is hygienic and easy\r\nto carry into the sun or the shade, as the observation of the moment\r\nmay demand; but it does not contain the victuals with which the\r\nScorpions, frugal though they be, cannot dispense indefinitely. With a\r\nview to feeding them without moving the cover, the trellis-work is\r\npierced at the top with a small opening through which I slip the live\r\ngame, caught from day to day as needed. After this has been served, a\r\nplug of cotton-wool closes the buttery hatch.\r\n\r\nMy caged specimens, soon after their installation, enable me to watch\r\ntheir work as excavators even better than the occupants of the open-air\r\ncommunity, for whom my trowel has prepared an entrance-passage beneath\r\nthe stones. The Languedocian Scorpion is master of craft; he knows how\r\nto house himself in a cell of his own making. In order to establish\r\nthemselves, each of my interned prisoners has at his disposal a wide,\r\ncurved potsherd, which, set firmly in the sand, provides the foundation\r\nof a grotto, a simple arched fissure. The Scorpion has only to dig\r\nbeneath this and lodge himself as comfortably as he can.\r\n\r\nThe excavator does not dally long, especially in the sun, whose glare\r\nannoys him. Steadying himself on his fourth pair of legs, the Scorpion\r\nrakes the ground with the three other pairs: he turns it over, reducing\r\nit to a loose dust with a graceful agility that reminds us of a Dog\r\nscratching a hole in which to bury a bone. After the brisk twirling of\r\nthe legs comes the touch of the broom. With his tail laid flat and\r\nrelaxed to the utmost, he pushes back the earthy mass, making the same\r\nmovement as does our elbow when thrusting an obstacle aside. If the\r\nrubbish thus shot back be not sufficiently out of the way, the sweeper\r\nreturns, repeats the process and finishes the job.\r\n\r\nObserve that the pincers, notwithstanding their strength, never take\r\npart in the digging, even to the extent of extracting a grain of sand.\r\nThey are reserved for feeding, fighting, and, above all, enquiry, and\r\nwould lose the exquisite sensitiveness of their fingers if used for\r\nthat heavy task. In this way the legs and tail, in repeated\r\nalternations, scratch the soil and thrust the rubbish outside. At last\r\nthe worker disappears beneath the potsherd. A mound of sand obstructs\r\nthe entrance to the vault. At moments we see it shaking and partly\r\nslipping, signs that the work is still going on with a further shooting\r\nof rubbish, until the cell attains a suitable size. When the hermit\r\nwants to go out, he will, without difficulty push back the crumbling\r\nbarricade.\r\n\r\nThe Black Scorpion of our houses has not this capacity for making\r\nhimself a crypt. He is found in the mortar collected at the bottom of\r\nwalls, the woodwork disjointed by the damp, the rubbish-heaps in dark\r\nplaces, but he restricts himself to using these refuges as he finds\r\nthem, being unable to improve the hiding-place by his own industry. He\r\ndoes not know how to dig. This ignorance is apparently due to his\r\nfeeble broom, his smooth, slender tail, very different from the\r\nLanguedocian’s, which is powerful and armed with knotty protuberances.\r\n\r\nIn the open air, the colony in the enclosure finds a lodging modelled\r\nby my care. Under the flat stones where I have contrived to outline a\r\ncell in the sandy earth, each of them at once disappears and labours to\r\ncomplete the work, as I perceived by the mound heaped upon the\r\nthreshold. Wait a few more days and lift the stone: at a depth of three\r\nor four inches we see the lair, the burrow, occupied at night and open\r\nalso by day, when the weather is bad. Sometimes a sudden bend widens\r\nthe recess into a spacious chamber. In front of the mansion,\r\nimmediately under the stone, is the entrance-hall.\r\n\r\nThis, by day, in the hours of blazing sunshine, is where the solitary\r\nprefers to be, in the blessed heat gently shaded by the stone. When\r\nturned out of this hot bath, his supreme felicity, he brandishes his\r\nknotty tail and swiftly retreats indoors, out of reach of the light and\r\nof our eyes. Replace the stone and come back fifteen minutes later: we\r\nshall find him once more on the threshold of the cavern, where it is so\r\npleasant when a generous sun warms the roof.\r\n\r\nThe cold season is thus passed in a very monotonous fashion. Both in\r\nthe hamlet of the enclosure and the menagerie of the cages, the\r\nScorpions go out neither by day nor at night, as I observe by the\r\nbarricade of sand which remains untouched at the entrance to the home.\r\nAre they torpid? Not a bit of it! My frequent visits show them always\r\nready for action, with curved and threatening tails. If the weather\r\ngrows cooler, they retreat to the bottom of their burrows; if it is\r\nfine, they return to the threshold to warm their backs by the touch of\r\nthe sunny stone. Nothing more for the moment: the anchorite’s life is\r\nspent in long spells of meditation, either in the cool moist crypt or\r\nunder the porch of the house, behind the sandy barricade.\r\n\r\nIn the course of April a sudden change takes place. In the cages, the\r\nshelter of the potsherds is abandoned. Gravely the occupants roam\r\naround the arena, clamber up the trellis and stand there, even by day.\r\nSeveral of them sleep out and do not go home again, preferring the\r\nout-of-door distractions to soft slumbers in the alcove under ground.\r\n\r\nIn the hamlet in the enclosure, events are more serious. Some of the\r\ninhabitants, selected from the smaller, leave the house at night and go\r\nwandering without my knowing what becomes of them. I expect to see them\r\nreturn at the end of their stroll, for no other part of the paddock has\r\nstones to suit them. Well, not one comes home; all that have gone have\r\ndisappeared for good. Soon the big ones also display the same vagabond\r\nmood; and at last the emigration becomes so active that a moment is at\r\nhand when I shall have nothing left of my free colony. Farewell to my\r\nlovingly cherished plans! The open-air community, on which I based my\r\nfondest hopes, becomes rapidly depopulated; its inhabitants make off,\r\nvanish I know not whither. All my seeking fails to recover a single one\r\nof the runaways.\r\n\r\nGreat ill calls for great remedies. I need an insuperable precinct,\r\nmuch more extensive than that of the cages, which establishments do not\r\ngive scope to the pastimes of my specimens. I have a forcing-frame in\r\nwhich some fleshy plants are stored during the winter. It goes to a\r\ndepth of three feet into the ground. The brick work is plastered and\r\nsmoothed with all the care that the mason’s trowel and wet rag can give\r\nit. I cover the bottom with fine sand and large flat stones distributed\r\nhere and there. Having made these preparations, I instal inside the\r\nframe, each under his own stone, the remaining Scorpions, and those\r\nwhich I have captured this very morning complete my collection. With\r\nthe aid of this vertical barrier shall I this time retain my specimens\r\nand see what interests me so greatly?\r\n\r\nI shall see nothing at all. Next morning, all of them, old and new,\r\nhave disappeared. There were twenty of them: and not one remains. Had I\r\nreflected ever so little, I should have expected this. At the season of\r\npersistent rain, in the autumn, how often have I not found the Black\r\nScorpion hiding in the crevices of the windows? Fleeing the dampness of\r\nhis usual retreats, the dark corners of the yards, he has clambered up\r\nto me by scaling the front wall to the height of the first storey. The\r\nslight roughness of the plaster was enough to enable his grapnels to\r\nmake the perpendicular ascent.\r\n\r\nDespite his corpulence, the Languedocian is as good a climber as the\r\nBlack Scorpion. I have a proof of it before my eyes. A barrier three\r\nfeet high, as smooth as a wash of common mortar can make it, has not\r\nstopped one of my captives. In a single night, the whole band has\r\ndecamped from the frame.\r\n\r\nRearing in the open air, even within walls, is recognized as being\r\nimpracticable: the lack of discipline in the flock nullifies the\r\nshepherd’s devices. One resource alone remains, that of internment\r\nunder cover. Thus the year ends, with some ten pans standing on the\r\nlarge table in my study. Out of doors is prohibited: those night\r\nprowlers, the cats, seeing something move about in my appliances, would\r\nupset everything.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the population is restricted under each cover and\r\namounts to two or three inhabitants at most. There is no space. In the\r\nabsence of a sufficiency of neighbours and also of the violent exposure\r\nto the sun which they enjoyed on their native hills, the prisoners on\r\nmy table seem smitten with home-sickness and hardly respond to my\r\nexpectations. Cowering under their potsherds or hanging to the trellis,\r\nmost of them slumber, dreaming of liberty. The small results which I\r\nobtain from my bored specimens is far from satisfying me. I want\r\nsomething more than this. The close of the year is spent in gleaning\r\npetty facts and making plans for a better establishment.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of these plans is a glazed prison whose panes will give no\r\nhold to the grapnels and will make climbing impossible. The joiner\r\nbuilds me a frame, the glazier completes the work. I myself varnish the\r\nwoodwork, so as to make the uprights very slippery. The structure looks\r\nlike four window-frames placed side by side and put together to form a\r\nrectangle. The bottom is a flooring with a layer of sand. A lid covers\r\nit altogether when the weather is cold and especially when the rain\r\nthreatens a flood, which would have disastrous effects on this\r\nundrained ground. It is raised more or less high according to the state\r\nof the day. The enclosure has ample room for two dozen chambers, each\r\nwith its potsherd and its occupant. Moreover, wide alleys and spacious\r\ncross-roads allow long walks to be taken without hindrance.\r\n\r\nWell, at the very moment when I believe myself to have solved the\r\nhousing-question satisfactorily, I perceive that the glazed park will\r\nnot retain its population long, if I do not invent a remedy. The glass\r\nstops short any attempt at scaling: for lack of adhesive sandals, the\r\nScorpions cannot grip a surface of this kind. They flounder against the\r\npanes, it is true, and raise themselves to their full length on the\r\nsupport of their tail: an excellent buttress, but they have hardly left\r\nthe ground before they fall back again, heavily.\r\n\r\nThings go wrong in respect of the wooden uprights, though these are\r\nmade as narrow as possible and varnished with particular care. The\r\nstubborn climbers clamber little by little along these smooth tracks;\r\nthey halt from time to time, clinging to the greasy pole, and then\r\nresume the difficult ascent. I surprise some who have reached the top\r\nand are on the point of escaping. My tweezers replace them in the fold.\r\nAs the ventilation of the home demands that the lid should remain\r\nraised during the greater part of the day, the place would soon be\r\nwholly deserted if I did not see to it.\r\n\r\nI think of greasing the uprights with a mixture of oil and soap. This\r\nrestrains the fugitives slightly, without succeeding in stopping them.\r\nTheir delicate little claws manage to sink into the pores of the wood\r\nthrough the substance coating it and the ascent begins anew. Let us try\r\na non-porous obstacle. I hang the walls with glazed paper. This time\r\nthe difficulty is insurmountable for the big, pot-bellied ones; it is\r\nnot quite so effective with regard to the others, who, being nimbler in\r\ntheir gait, try to hoist themselves up and often succeed in doing so. I\r\nget the better of them only by glossing the glazed paper with soot.\r\n\r\nHenceforth there are no more escapes, though attempts at flight\r\ncontinue. Coming after the experiment with the forcing-frames, these\r\nfeats of prowess on slippery surfaces tell us all there is to learn\r\nabout an aptitude which the animal’s corpulence was far from leading us\r\nto suspect. Like his black colleague who enters our houses, the\r\nLanguedocian Scorpion is a skilled climber.\r\n\r\nBehold me then the owner of three establishments, each possessing its\r\nadvantages and its defects: the free colony at the end of the paddock;\r\nthe wire-gauze cages in my study; and lastly the glazed rock-garden. I\r\nshall consult them turn and turn about, especially the last. To the\r\nevidence supplied in this manner we will add the rare data gathered\r\nfrom stones turned over on the original sites. The Scorpions’ luxurious\r\nCrystal Palace, now the leading curiosity of my home, stands all the\r\nyear round in the open air, on a bench at a few steps from my door. Not\r\na member of the family passes it without a glance. Taciturn creatures,\r\nshall I succeed in making you speak?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE LANGUEDOCIAN SCORPION: FOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nI begin by learning that, despite his terrible weapon, a likely token\r\nof brigandage and gluttony, the Languedocian Scorpion is an extremely\r\nfrugal eater. When I visit him at home, among the pebbles of the\r\nadjacent hills, I carefully ransack his haunts in the hope of coming\r\nupon the remains of an ogre’s feast, and I come upon nothing more than\r\nthe crumbs of a hermit’s collation: in fact, as a rule, I find nothing\r\nat all. A few green wing-cases belonging to some Tree bug; wings of the\r\nadult Ant-lion; dismembered segments of a puny Locust: these make up my\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nThe hamlet in the paddock, assiduously consulted, tells me more. After\r\nthe fashion of a valetudinarian who lives on a diet and eats at stated\r\nhours, the Scorpion has his feeding-season. For six or seven months,\r\nfrom October till April, he does not leave his dwelling, though always\r\nfit and ready to wield his tail. During this period, if I put any sort\r\nof food within his reach, he sweeps it out of the burrow with the back\r\nof his tail and pays it no further attention.\r\n\r\nIt is at the end of March that the first cravings of the stomach are\r\naroused. At this season, on inspecting the cabins, I sometimes find one\r\nor other of my specimens quietly gnawing at a capture, a meagre\r\nMyriapod, such as a Cryptops or Lithobius. For that matter, the\r\nfrequency of the item is far from making up for its smallness; and it\r\nis long before the consumer of the scanty morsel finds himself in\r\npossession of a second.\r\n\r\nI expected something better:\r\n\r\n“A brute like that,” I said to myself, “so well armed for battle,\r\ncannot be content with trifles. We do not load our pea-shooters with a\r\ncharge of dynamite to bring down a Sparrow: that awful sting was never\r\nmeant to stab a humble little animal. The Scorpion’s food must be some\r\npowerful quarry.”\r\n\r\nI was wrong. Terribly equipped for fighting though he be, the Scorpion\r\nis an indifferent hunter.\r\n\r\nHe is a poltroon into the bargain. A little Mantis, come into being\r\nthat same day and encountered on the road, fills him with dismay. A\r\nCabbage Butterfly [7] puts him to flight merely by beating the ground\r\nwith her clipped wings: the harmless cripple overawes his cowardice. It\r\nneeds the stimulus of hunger to persuade him to attack.\r\n\r\nWhat am I to give him, when his appetite begins to awaken in April?\r\nLike the Spiders, he requires a live prey, seasoned with blood that is\r\nnot yet congealed: he requires a morsel quivering in the throes of\r\ndeath. He never eats a corpse. The game, moreover, must be tender and\r\nof small size. Thinking to give him a treat, in the early days of my\r\nexperience as a rearer of Scorpions, I offered him Locusts, picking out\r\nthe biggest. He obstinately refused them. They were too tough, and,\r\nbesides, too difficult to handle, owing to their kicks, which\r\ndemoralize the coward.\r\n\r\nI try the Field Cricket, [8] with a belly as plump and luscious as a\r\npat of butter. I drop half-a-dozen into the glazed enclosure, with a\r\nleaf of lettuce which will console them for the horrors of the lions’\r\nden. The singers seem not to heed their terrible neighbours; they sing\r\ntheir little songs and nibble at their salad. If a strolling Scorpion\r\nappears upon the scene, they look at him: they point their slender\r\nantennæ in his direction, without any other sign of perturbation at the\r\napproach of the passing monster. He, on his side, draws back as soon as\r\nhe sees them: he is afraid of getting into trouble with these\r\nstrangers. Should he touch one of them with the tip of his pincers,\r\nforthwith he flees, overcome with terror. The six Crickets spend a\r\nmonth with the wild beasts and none takes note of them. They are too\r\nbig, too fat. My six patients are restored to freedom as safe and sound\r\nas when they entered the cage.\r\n\r\nI serve up Woodlice, Glomeres, [9] Iuli, all the rabble of the rocks\r\nbeloved of the Scorpion; I make a trial with Asidæ [10] and Opatra\r\nwhich, assiduous lurkers under the stones in the actual places\r\nfrequented by the hunters, might well be the customary game; I offer\r\nClythra-beetles, [11] gathered on the brushwood beside the burrows, and\r\nCicindelæ [12] captured on the sand in my guests’ very domain: nothing,\r\nabsolutely nothing is accepted, apparently because of the ungrateful\r\nexterior.\r\n\r\nWhere shall I find that modest mouthful, at once tender and savoury?\r\nChance provides me with it. In May I am visited by a Beetle with soft\r\nwing-cases, Omophlus lepturoides, a finger’s-breadth long. He arrived\r\nsuddenly in the enclosure in swarms. Around an ilex all yellow with\r\ncatkins there is a whirling cloud of Beetles, flying, settling, sipping\r\nsweets and frantically attending to their love-affairs. This life of\r\nrevelry lasts a fortnight: then they all disappear in caravans going\r\none knows not whither. On behalf of my boarders, we will levy on these\r\nnomads, who look to me as though they would be suitable. I was right in\r\nmy assumption. After a long, a very long wait, I see the Scorpion make\r\na meal. Here he comes, stealthily advancing towards the insect\r\nmotionless on the ground. He does not hunt his quarry: he gathers it\r\nin. There is neither hurry nor contest, no movement of the tail, no use\r\nof the poisoned weapon. The Scorpion placidly grabs the morsel with his\r\ntwo-fingered hands; the pincers bend back, carry it to the mouth and\r\nthen both hold it until it is all consumed. The insect that is being\r\neaten, full of life, struggles between the mandibles, to the resentment\r\nof the eater, who likes to nibble quietly.\r\n\r\nThen the dart bends down before the mouth; very gently it pricks the\r\ninsect once or twice and paralyses it. The mastication is resumed and\r\nthe sting continues to tap, as though the consumer were swallowing the\r\nmorsel a forkful at a time.\r\n\r\nAt last the insect, patiently chewed and chewed again for hours on end,\r\nhas become a dry pellet which the stomach would refuse; but this\r\nresidue has entered the gullet so far that the sated Scorpion cannot\r\nalways reject it directly. The intervention of the pincers is required\r\nto extricate it. One of them seizes the pill with the finger-tips,\r\ndaintily extracts it from the throat and drops it to the ground. The\r\nmeal is finished: it will not be repeated for a long time to come.\r\n\r\nA great improvement on the wire-gauze covers, the large glazed cage,\r\nfull of animation in the evening twilight, provides me with abundant\r\ninformation touching this strange frugality. In April and May,\r\nessentially the season of festive assemblies and banquets, I provision\r\nthe place lavishly with game. At this time my lilac-walk abounds with\r\nCabbage Butterflies and Swallowtails. Caught in the net, their wings\r\npartly amputated, a dozen of these Butterflies are let loose in the\r\nestablishment, whence their maimed condition will prevent them from\r\nescaping.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, at about eight o’clock, the wild beasts leave their\r\nlairs. They stop for a moment on the threshold of their potsherds to\r\nenquire into the state of things; then, gathering from more or less all\r\ndirections, they begin to stroll to and fro, with their tails now\r\nuplifted now trailing behind them with the tip always curling upwards.\r\nThe mood of the moment and the objects encountered determine the\r\nposture. The discreet light of a lantern hung outside the panes allows\r\nme to watch events.\r\n\r\nThe mutilated Butterflies whirl in short flights over the ground.\r\nThrough this desperately fluttering mob the Scorpions pass to and fro,\r\nknocking them over and trampling on them, without taking further notice\r\nof them. Sometimes, in the hazards of this scrimmage, one of the\r\ncripples settles on the ogre’s back. He does not mind these\r\nfamiliarities, makes no protest and carries his unaccustomed rider up\r\nand down. Some of the heedless creatures fling themselves under the\r\nstrollers’ pincers; others actually touch the horrible mouth. It makes\r\nno difference: the Scorpions disdain their food.\r\n\r\nA similar experiment is repeated nightly, so long as Pieres abound on\r\nthe lilac-bushes. My catering leads to very little. From time to time,\r\nhowever, I witness a capture. A Butterfly fluttering on the ground is\r\ngrabbed by one of the promenaders. The Scorpion quickly snaps her up\r\nwithout a pause and goes his way, with his pincers still groping and\r\nheld before him like a pair of distraught arms. This time, the hands do\r\nnot keep the morsel within reach of the mouth, being otherwise occupied\r\nin reconnoitring the path followed: it is the mandibles only that carry\r\nthe booty. The Butterfly, eaten alive, desperately flaps what is left\r\nof her wings. She produces the impression of a white plume waving on\r\nthe crest of the savage victor. If the captive’s struggles become\r\nexcessively inconvenient, the spoiler, still walking along and\r\nmunching, quiets her with little pats of his sting. At last he flings\r\nthe prize away. What has he eaten? Just the head, no more.\r\n\r\nLess often, others hasten to convey the booty to their lairs beneath\r\nthe potsherds. Here the meal will be taken far from the madding crowd.\r\nOthers, after securing their capture, withdraw to a corner of the\r\nenclosure and refresh themselves in the open, with their belly on the\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nA week later, after a certain number of these incidents, I inspect the\r\nplace and examine the caves one by one, to ascertain the amount of\r\nprovisions consumed. The wings, those uneatable leavings, will\r\nenlighten me in this respect. Well, save for rare exceptions, there are\r\nno wings detached from the corpses. Nearly all the Butterflies are\r\nintact; they have dried up without being eaten. A few of them, three or\r\nfour, have been decapitated. The results of my conscientious\r\ninvestigations are limited to this. During a week, in the full swing of\r\nactivity, a tiny mouthful has been enough for these head-eaters. There\r\nare twenty-five of them in my establishment, twenty-five sated with a\r\ncrumb.\r\n\r\nTo them the Butterfly must be an almost unknown fare. It is doubtful\r\nwhether, down in their rocky labyrinths, they ever capture such game,\r\nwhich loves tall blossoms and sinuous flights. Unfamiliar with this\r\nquarry, they may disdain it, merely taking a bite in the absence of\r\nfood more to their taste. Now what can they find in their wild,\r\nsun-parched territory?\r\n\r\nLocusts apparently. Crickets, a horde that is never lacking wherever\r\nthere is a blade of grass to nibble. It is on these that I rely by\r\npreference when the season of the Pieres and other ordinary Butterflies\r\ncloses. The paddock then abounds in Crickets and Locusts, a very\r\nyouthful generation, clad only in a short jacket. These are surely the\r\nproper diet for my Scorpions, with their love of tender mouthfuls. Some\r\nare green, others grey; some fat, others thin; some are mounted on\r\nstilts, others are squat and short-shanked. The consumers can make\r\ntheir choice amid this varied assortment.\r\n\r\nAt nightfall, in the area faintly lighted by the lantern, I distribute\r\nmy crop of Locusts, who are fairly quiet at this late hour. The\r\nScorpions lose no time in making their appearance. The living manna is\r\nwriggling all about them. At the least tap, the nearest strollers\r\ndecamp; they find things too exciting. It is an exact repetition of the\r\nexperiments with the Butterflies: none sets any store by the tit-bits,\r\nmost certainly seen and even touched, for the Scorpions often encounter\r\nthem and walk on them.\r\n\r\nI see a Locust who, as luck will have it, has got caught in the fingers\r\nof a passing Scorpion; and the latter is too good-natured even to close\r\nhis pincers. Ever so gentle a squeeze would put him in possession of an\r\nexcellent head of game; and heedlessly he allows it to slip away. I see\r\na little Green Locust hoisted by accident on the back of a promenader,\r\na terrible mount that carries her quietly, without dreaming of harming\r\nher. A hundred times I witness face-to-face meetings, defensive\r\nretreats, swishes of the tail that sweep aside the heedless creature\r\nencountered on the highway, but never any serious hand-to-hand\r\nfighting, still less pursuit. It is only at rare intervals that my\r\ndaily observations show me one or other of my frugal eaters in\r\npossession of a Locust.\r\n\r\nAt pairing-time, in April and May, a sudden change of behaviour turns\r\nthe sober Scorpion into a glutton and makes her indulge in scandalous\r\norgies. At this season I often come upon a Scorpion in the enclosure,\r\nunder her tile, devouring one of her own kind in perfect quietude, as\r\nshe might devour an ordinary head of game. Everything goes down,\r\nexcept, as a rule, the tail, which remains hanging for whole days from\r\nthe sated creature’s jaws and is finally rejected as though with\r\nregret. It may be presumed that the poison-phial at the end of the\r\njoint has something to do with this refusal. Perhaps the toxic fluid\r\nhas a flavour which is unpleasant to the consumer’s taste.\r\n\r\nApart from this remnant, the devoured Scorpion disappears entirely into\r\na belly whose capacity seems inferior in bulk to the things swallowed.\r\nIt takes a very obliging stomach to find room for such a dish. Before\r\nbeing chewed and packed away, the contents must be larger than the\r\ncontainer. Now these Gargantuan banquets are not normal reflections but\r\nmatrimonial rites, to which we shall have occasion to return. They take\r\nplace only in the mating-season: and the animals devoured are always\r\nmales.\r\n\r\nI shall not therefore enter these Scorpions who die victims of their\r\nembraces on the list of normal victuals. What we see here is the\r\naberrations of an animal at rutting-time, wedding-orgies worthy of\r\nfiguring beside the tragic nuptials of the Praying Mantis. [13] Nor\r\nshall I enter the feasts provoked by my artifices, when I confront the\r\nScorpion with a powerful adversary and worry the two combatants in my\r\neagerness to see the duel. Thus exasperated, the Scorpion defends\r\nhimself and stabs; then, in the intoxication of his victory, he eats\r\nthe fallen foe, in so far as his swallowing-faculties permit. This is\r\nhis manner of celebrating his triumph. Never, but for my intervention,\r\nwould he have dared to attack such an enemy; never would he have bitten\r\ninto such a bulky prey.\r\n\r\nApart from these banquets, which are too exceptional to be taken into\r\naccount, I note none but frugal collations. My vigilance is perhaps at\r\nfault; it might well be that the consumption is greater at late hours\r\nof the night, in the absence of witnesses; and therefore, before\r\ngranting the Scorpion a certificate for extreme moderation in diet, I\r\nappeal to the following experiment, which will give us a definite\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nEarly in autumn, four medium-sized specimens are installed separately,\r\neach in a saucer furnished with a layer of fine sand and a potsherd. A\r\npane of glass closes the receptacle, prevents the escape of the skilful\r\nclimbers and allows the sun to enliven the dwelling. Without keeping\r\nout the air, the lid is enough to prevent any small game, such as\r\nClothes-moths or Mosquitoes, from entering the enclosed space. The four\r\nsaucers are deposited in a conservatory where a tropical temperature\r\nholds sway for the greater part of the day. No provisions are served by\r\nme, nor will the least mouthful ever arrive from the outside, unless it\r\nbe some vagrom Ant. In this total absence of provisions, what will\r\nbecome of the interned Scorpions?\r\n\r\nAlways brisk and lively without a scrap of food, they go to earth under\r\nthe potsherd. They rummage about and dig themselves a burrow closed by\r\na barrier of sand. From time to time, especially in the evening\r\ntwilight, they issue from their lair, take a short stroll and then go\r\nhome again, behaving just as though they had been fed.\r\n\r\nWhen the cold sets in, though it is not freezing in the green-house,\r\nthe prisoners no longer leave their home, which has been dug a little\r\ndeeper in anticipation of the severe weather. Their health, for that\r\nmatter, continues excellent. When I inspect them, as my curiosity often\r\nprompts me to do, I find them always fit and ready to repair the burrow\r\nwhich I have disturbed.\r\n\r\nWinter ends without mishap. There is nothing unusual in this: the cold\r\nseason, while suspending activity, moderates or even does away with the\r\nneed for refection. But the heat returns and, with it, the need of\r\nfood, which calls for provisions. Now what do the fasters do while\r\ntheir kinsmen in the glass cage are restoring their strength with\r\nButterflies and Locusts? Are they languid and anæmic? Not at all.\r\n\r\nQuite as vigorous as those who have been feeding, they brandish their\r\ngnarled tails and reply to my teasing with threatening gestures. If I\r\nworry them too much, they run away quickly along the circumference of\r\nthe saucer. Famine does not seem to have tried them. This cannot go on\r\nindefinitely. About the middle of June, three of the captives die; the\r\nfourth holds out till July. It has taken nine months of absolute\r\nabstinence to put an end to their activity.\r\n\r\nAnother test is arranged for very young specimens, about a couple of\r\nmonths old. They measure about an inch in length, from the forehead to\r\nthe tip of the tail. Their colouring is brighter than that of the\r\nadults; the pincers in particular look as though they were carved out\r\nof amber and coral. The future horror has his attractive points in\r\nearly youth.—I find them under the stones from October onwards.\r\nInvariably solitary like their elders, they dig themselves, under the\r\nchosen shelter, a little hole barricaded by a sandy mound consisting of\r\nthe rubbish of the excavations. When taken from their retreat, they run\r\nalong nimbly, curving their tails over their backs and brandishing\r\ntheir fragile stings.\r\n\r\nIn October I place four of them in as many tumblers closed with a\r\nmuslin veil, an insuperable obstacle to any tiny prey coming from the\r\noutside. The prisoners have for digging purposes a finger’s-breadth of\r\nfine sand and as shelter a small disk of cardboard. Well, these little\r\nfellows undergo abstinence as pluckily as the adults and are still\r\nactive and restless in the months of May and June.\r\n\r\nThese two experiments prove to us that the Scorpion, while retaining\r\nhis activity, is capable of dispensing with food during three fourths\r\nof the year. It must therefore take a long time to make him corpulent.\r\n\r\nA caterpillar that lives only a few days is continually browsing to\r\naccumulate the substance of the future Butterfly; its voracious\r\nappetite makes up for the shortness of the banquet. How does the\r\nScorpion contrive to hoard so much matter out of crumbs so few and far\r\nbetween? With him the accumulation of tissue must be the work of\r\nexceptional longevity.\r\n\r\nIt is not very difficult to arrive at an approximate estimate of his\r\nlength of life. The stones turned over at different periods give us the\r\nanswer as clearly as the archives of a record-office would do. I find,\r\nin respect of size, five classes of Scorpions. The smallest measure\r\ntwo-thirds of an inch in length; the largest four inches. Between these\r\ntwo extremes, three sizes are quite distinctly discernible.\r\n\r\nBeyond a doubt, each of these categories corresponds with a year’s\r\ndifference in age, perhaps even more, for each stage seems to be a\r\nprotracted one; at all events the progress in size is hardly\r\nperceptible, at the end of a year, in the specimens in my\r\nrearing-cages. The Languedocian Scorpion therefore boasts the\r\nprerogative of a green old age: he lives five years and probably\r\nlonger. He has ample time, as we see, to wax fat on scraps.\r\n\r\nTo grow big is not everything: activity is essential. The scraps will\r\nbe repeated, it is true, but always so sparingly and at such distant\r\nintervals that we begin to wonder what part eating really plays in this\r\ninstance. My prisoners, large and small, subjected to a strict fast,\r\ngive especial cause for reflection. Whenever I disturb their repose—and\r\nmy curiosity deprives itself of few opportunities—they move about\r\nbriskly, brandishing their tails, delving the sand, sweeping it,\r\nshifting it; in short, they expend many kilogram-metres of energy, to\r\nuse the technical expression; and this goes on for eight or nine\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIn performing this work what do they expend on materials? Nothing. From\r\nthe first day of their imprisonment all food is cut off. The thought\r\noccurs to the mind of nutritive reserves, of adipose savings\r\naccumulated in the organism. The animal, according to this, in order to\r\nbalance the expenditure of energy, would live upon itself.\r\n\r\nWith portly adults the explanation would be valid in a certain measure;\r\nbut I have subjected lean specimens, of medium age, to the test; I have\r\nselected young ones, just beginning life. What can these small\r\nScorpions have in their bellies? What do they possess that can be\r\ntransformed into motor energy by vital oxidation? The scalpel cannot\r\nfind it and the imagination refuses to appraise it, so great is the\r\ndisproportion between the amount of work accomplished and the worker’s\r\nbulk. If the whole animal were before all a combustible and were to\r\nburn to the last atom, the total sum of heat emitted would still be far\r\nfrom equivalent to the total sum of the mechanical effects. Our\r\nfactories cannot keep an engine going, all the year round, with a lump\r\nof coal as its whole provision.\r\n\r\nMy Scorpions hardly seem to consume even this lump of fuel. After a\r\nlong and rigorous abstinence, they are as fresh and brightly-coloured,\r\nas glossy with health as at the beginning of the experiment.\r\n\r\nWe can understand the Snail, sunk in a deep inertia and contracted\r\nwithin his shell, whose opening he has closed with a chalky lid or a\r\nparchment cover: he no longer eats, but neither does he see; he exists\r\non his reserves by slowing down his vital processes to the lowest\r\npossible limits. The Scorpion, always moving about, despite the\r\nexcessive prolongation of the fast, is beyond our comprehension.\r\n\r\nFor the third time in the course of our studies, with reference to the\r\nyoung first of the Lycosa [14], then of the Clotho Spider [15], and now\r\nof the Scorpion, we are led back to the same suspicion. Is it a fact\r\nthat animals of an organization very different from our own, deprived\r\nof an individual temperature determined by an active oxidation, are\r\ngoverned by biological laws which are immutable in the whole series of\r\nliving creatures? Need movement in them be always the result of\r\ncombustion for which eating would furnish the materials? Might they not\r\nderive their activity, at least in part, from the circumambient\r\nenergies, heat, electricity, light and so on, varying modes of the same\r\nmotive power?\r\n\r\nThese energies are the soul of the world, the unfathomable vortex which\r\nsets the material universe in motion. Would it then be paradoxical to\r\npicture the animal in certain cases as a highly perfected accumulator,\r\ncapable of collecting the circumambient heat, of transmuting it in its\r\ntissues into a mechanical equivalent and of returning it in the form of\r\nmotion? This would suggest a possibility that the animal might perform\r\nwork in the absence of energizing matter absorbed as food.\r\n\r\nAh, life made a superb discovery when, in prehistoric times, it\r\ninvented the Scorpion! To work without eating: what an incomparable\r\ngift, had it become general! What miseries, what horrors would be\r\nabolished, if we were freed from the tyranny of the stomach! Why was\r\nthis wonderful attempt not continued, why was it not perfected in\r\ncreatures of a higher order? What a pity that the initial example was\r\nnot followed in an ever-increasing progression! Then perhaps to-day,\r\nexempted from the ignominious hunt for food, thought, the loftiest and\r\nmost delicate expression of activity, would restore itself after\r\nfatigue with a ray of sunshine.\r\n\r\nOf this gift of yore, full of unrealized promises, certain constituents\r\nhave nevertheless been disseminated throughout the animal kingdom. We\r\nourselves live by solar radiation; we derive part of our energy from\r\nit. The Arab, supporting existence on a handful of dates, is no less\r\nactive than the man of the north, gorged with meat and beer; though he\r\ndoes not fill his stomach so plentifully, he has a bigger share in the\r\nbanquet of the sun.\r\n\r\nAll things considered then, the Scorpion must derive the main part of\r\nhis energizing food from the circumambient warmth. As for the plastic\r\nfood indispensable to physical growth, its turn comes, a little sooner\r\nor later, announced by a moult. The stiff tunic splits along the back;\r\nthe animal slips gently out of its cast clothes, which have become too\r\ntight. Then comes the imperious call for food, were it only to make\r\ngood the cost of the new skin. Henceforth, if the fast continues, my\r\nprisoners, especially the smaller ones, die before long.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE LANGUEDOCIAN SCORPION: THE POISON\r\n\r\n\r\nIn attacking small game, his usual fare, the Scorpion hardly uses his\r\nweapon. He seizes the insect with his two pincers and thus holds it the\r\nwhole time within reach of his mouth, which nibbles slowly. Sometimes,\r\nif the victim struggles and disturbs the repast, the tail comes curving\r\ndown and, with a series of little taps, deprives the patient of the\r\npower of movement. When all is said, the sting plays but a very\r\nsubordinate part in the acquisition of food.\r\n\r\nIt is really of no use to the animal except in a moment of danger, face\r\nto face with an enemy. I do not know against what foes the formidable\r\nbeast may have to defend itself. Who among the frequenters of the stony\r\nwastes would venture to attack it? Though I do not know on what\r\noccasions, in the normal course of things, the Scorpion is obliged to\r\ntake measures of defence. I can at least resort to artifice and arrange\r\nencounters which will force him to fight in grim earnest. To judge of\r\nthe violence of his poison, I propose to place him in the presence of\r\nvarious powerful foes, without leaving the domain of entomology.\r\n\r\nA Languedocian Scorpion and a Narbonne Lycosa are put into a large jar,\r\nwith a layer of sand at the bottom, which affords a less slippery\r\nfoothold than the glass. The two are similarly equipped with poisonous\r\nfangs. Which of the two will gain the upper hand and eat the other?\r\nWhile the Lycosa is the less powerful, she has the advantage of\r\nagility, which enables her to leap on her adversary and attack him\r\nunexpectedly. Before the defender, who is slow in countering, is able\r\nto adopt the fighting attitude, the other will deliver her stroke and\r\nflee before the brandished sting. The chances would seem to favour the\r\nactive Spider.\r\n\r\nThe events do not correspond with these probabilities. So soon as she\r\nperceives the enemy, the Lycosa stands half-erect, opens her fangs, on\r\nwhich a drop of poison is gathering, and boldly waits. The Scorpion\r\napproaches with short steps, extending his pincers in front of him.\r\nWith his two-fingered hands he seizes and holds the Spider, who\r\nprotests desperately, opening and closing her fangs without being able\r\nto bite, kept as she is at a distance. The struggle becomes impossible\r\nwith such an adversary, armed with long pincers which hold the foe\r\nhelpless at arm’s length and prevent her approach.\r\n\r\nWithout any sort of contest, therefore, the Scorpion curves his tail,\r\nbrings it down in front of his forehead and drives the sting, entirely\r\nat his ease, into the victim’s black breast. This is not the\r\ninstantaneous thrust of the Wasps and the other four-winged fighters:\r\nto make the weapon penetrate requires a certain effort. The knotted\r\ntail pushes, swaying slightly: it turns the sting to and fro as we\r\ntwist a pointed tool with our fingers to make it enter a hard\r\nsubstance. When the hole is made, the sting lingers in the wound for a\r\nmoment, doubtless to allow time for a larger dose of virus to escape.\r\nThe result is overwhelming. No sooner is the sturdy Lycosa stung than\r\nshe draws up her legs. She is dead.\r\n\r\nI have treated myself to this stirring spectacle with half-a-dozen\r\nvictims. What the first experiment showed me the others repeated. There\r\nis always the instant attack by the Scorpion the moment he sees the\r\nLycosa, always the tactics of the tongs holding the enemy at a\r\ndistance, always the sudden death of the spitted Spider. If I crushed\r\nthe animal underfoot, the inertia produced would be no more immediate.\r\nIt is as though the Lycosa had been struck dead by lightning.\r\n\r\nTo eat the vanquished enemy is the rule, all the more inasmuch as the\r\nplump Spider is a magnificent prey, such as but rarely falls to the\r\nScorpion’s lot in his usual hunting-grounds. Then and there, without\r\ndelay, he sits down to his meal, commencing with the head, his\r\ncustomary routine with any sort of game. Motionless, he crunches and\r\nswallows, in tiny mouthfuls. Everything is consumed, excepting a few\r\njoints of the legs, which are tough morsels. The Gargantuan feast lasts\r\nfor twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nWhen the banquet is over, we wonder how the dish has managed to\r\ndisappear into a belly hardly larger than the thing eaten. Those who\r\nare exposed to interminable fasts, and are compelled to gorge\r\nthemselves to excess when the occasion offers, must have special\r\ndigestive powers.\r\n\r\nIf the Scorpion attacks the Lycosa, who would be capable of making a\r\nserious defence were she to rush upon the enemy, instead of proudly\r\nstanding with her breast uncovered, what will be the fate of the meek\r\nEpeiræ? [16] All, even the largest, the Angular, the Banded, and the\r\nSilky Epeira, are fiercely attacked, all the more since these poor\r\nspinners, demoralized by fear, do not even try to fling their hanks of\r\ncord, which so promptly paralyse the assailant. In their webs, with a\r\nlavish discharge of snares, they would master the ferocious Mantis,\r\n[17] the formidable Hornet, or the big Locust, that expert kicker. Away\r\nfrom their own homes, faced by an enemy and not a victim, they utterly\r\nforget their potent methods of binding the foe. When stung, they all\r\ninstantly succumb, struck dead like the Lycosa; and the Scorpion feasts\r\nupon them.\r\n\r\nUnder the stone, the Spider-lover never meets the Lycosa or the Epeiræ,\r\nwho frequent other regions; but he may, at long intervals, find other\r\nSpiders, addicted like himself to sheltering in rocky refuges, and\r\nnotably the timid Clotho. [18] He is therefore pretty familiar with\r\nthis sort of game, and any fair-sized Spider suits him, provided that\r\nhe be hungry.\r\n\r\nI suspect him of being by no means indifferent to the capture of a\r\nPraying Mantis, another highly meritorious dish. Certainly he does not\r\ngo in search of her on the bushes, the usual resort of this ravenous\r\ninsect: his means of climbing, which are excellently adapted to scaling\r\na wall, would never permit him to walk on the wavering support of the\r\nleaves. He must strike when the mother is pregnant, towards the end of\r\nthe summer. As a matter of fact, I fairly often find the nest of the\r\nPraying Mantis fastened to the lower surface of the lumps of stone\r\nhaunted by the Scorpion.\r\n\r\nThe highwayman may make his approach, in quest of victuals, on a\r\npeaceful night, just when the labouring mother is whipping the froth of\r\nher egg-filled casket. [19] What happens then I have never witnessed;\r\nprobably I never shall: it would be asking too much of luck. Let us\r\nfill the gap by artificial means.\r\n\r\nIn the cock-pit of an earthenware dish, I provoke a duel between a\r\nScorpion and a Mantis, both selected of a good size. If necessary, I\r\nstimulate them, urge them to the encounter. I already know that not all\r\nthe blows of the tail take effect: very often they are mere raps on the\r\nhead. Sparing of his poison and scorning to sting when there is no\r\npressing need, the Scorpion repels the intruder with a sudden back\r\nstroke of the tail, without using the needle. In our various\r\nexperiments we will count only the blows which draw blood in proof that\r\nthe sting has penetrated.\r\n\r\nWhen seized with the tweezers, the Mantis instantly adopts the spectral\r\nattitude, [20] with the saw-toothed legs open and the wings displayed\r\nlike an heraldic crest. This scare-crow attitude, so far from\r\nsucceeding, makes the attack all the easier: the sting plunges into the\r\nbase, between the two lethal limbs, and lingers for some time in the\r\nwound. When it is withdrawn, there is still a drop of poison oozing at\r\nthe tip.\r\n\r\nThen and there the Mantis draws up her legs in the throes of death. The\r\nbelly heaves, the caudal appendages wave by fits and starts, the tarsi\r\ngive faint quivers. On the other hand, the lethal legs, the antennæ,\r\nand the mouth-parts are motionless. This condition is followed, in less\r\nthan fifteen minutes, by complete inertia.\r\n\r\nThe Scorpion does not think out his blows; he strikes at random any\r\npoint within reach. This time he has stabbed a part which is eminently\r\nvulnerable, because of the proximity of the principal nerve-centres; he\r\nhas stung the Mantis in the breast, between the lethal legs, precisely\r\nwhere the Mantis-killing Tachytes [21] wounds her victim with the\r\nobject of paralysing it. The act is fortuitous and not intentional: the\r\nlout is not an expert anatomist like the Wasp. As luck would have it,\r\ndeath was instantaneous. What would happen if the sting were delivered\r\nin another, less dangerous part of the body?\r\n\r\nI change the operator, to make sure that the poison-phial is charged. I\r\nshall take the same precaution in the various subsequent encounters:\r\neach fresh victim will have a fresh executioner, whose full powers have\r\nbeen restored by a long rest.\r\n\r\nThe Mantis, another powerful matron, stands half-erect, turns her head\r\n[22] and looks at him warily over her shoulder. She assumes her\r\nspectral attitude, with puffing sounds produced by rubbing the wings\r\ntogether. Her boldness at first succeeds: she manages to seize her\r\nadversary’s tail with her toothed fore-arms. As long as she holds\r\ntight, the Scorpion is disarmed and unable to hurt her.\r\n\r\nBut fatigue supervenes, enhanced by terror. The Mantis had seized the\r\ntail brandished in front of her as she might have harpooned any other\r\npart of the body, without doubting the efficiency of her manœuvre. The\r\npoor simpleton opens her trap. She is lost. The Scorpion stings her in\r\nthe abdomen, not far from the third pair of legs. Complete collapse\r\nensues, like that of a piece of clockwork whose mainspring is broken.\r\n\r\nIt is not in my power to obtain stings at this or that point as I\r\nchoose: the irascible Scorpion does not lend himself to the liberty of\r\nattempting to guide his weapon. I make the most of the various\r\ninstances that occur in the hazards of the contest. Some of them are\r\nworth recording, because of the great distance from the centres of\r\ninnervation.\r\n\r\nThis time the Mantis is stung on one of the lethal limbs, in the\r\nfine-skinned joint of the arm and fore-arm. This results in immediate\r\ninertia of the limb affected and soon after of the second. The other\r\nlegs curl up: there are pulsations of the abdomen; and absolute\r\nimmobility quickly follows. Death is almost instantaneous.\r\n\r\nAnother is stung in the joint between the shank and the thigh of one of\r\nthe middle legs. Suddenly the four hind-legs fold back; the wings which\r\nthe insect had not outspread at the moment of the attack, are unfurled\r\nconvulsively, as in the spectral attitude, and remain outspread even\r\nafter death. The murderous legs flounder about in disorder: they\r\nclutch, they open, they close again; the antennæ move, the palpi\r\ntremble, the abdomen throbs, the caudal appendages wave to and fro.\r\nAnother fifteen minutes of this tumultuous death-struggle: and all is\r\nstill; the Mantis is no more.\r\n\r\nAnd so in all the instances in which my curiosity, greatly excited by\r\nthe stirring aspect of the tragedy, indulges whatever the point\r\nattacked, whether near the nerve-centres or farther away, the Mantis\r\nalways succumbs, sometimes instantly, sometimes after a few minutes’\r\nconvulsions. Rattlesnakes, Vipers, Puff-adders and other venomous\r\nSnakes of dreadful renown do not kill their victims more promptly.\r\n\r\nAt first I regarded this as due to a highly-strung organism, which is\r\nall the more sensitive and vulnerable because it is better equipped.\r\nPicked creatures both, said I to myself, the Spider and the Mantis die\r\ninstantaneously from an injury which a ruder creature would endure for\r\nhours and days, perhaps even without any great inconvenience. Let us\r\nthen try the Mole-cricket, the detested Taiocebo of the Provençal\r\ngardener. A strange beast indeed is this root-cutter; powerful, too,\r\nclumsy and of a lower type. When you grip it firmly in your hand, it\r\nmakes you let go by digging into your skin with the toothed toes of its\r\nhind-legs, copied from the Mole’s.\r\n\r\nWhen brought into contact in a narrow arena, Scorpion and Mole-cricket\r\nlook each other in the face and seem to recognize each other. Can there\r\nhave been encounters between them from time to time? It is very\r\ndoubtful. The Mole-cricket is an inmate of our gardens, of rich soil in\r\nwhich green vegetables convoke underground vermin; the Scorpion is\r\nfaithful to the sun-scorched slopes on which dry grasses find it\r\ndifficult to grow. Meetings are hardly probable between the inhabitants\r\nof barren and of fruitful soil.\r\n\r\nThough unknown to each other, they none the less realize the gravity of\r\nthe danger confronting them. With no provocation from me, the Scorpion\r\nrushes at the Mole-cricket, who, for her part, assumes an aggressive\r\nposture, with her shears ready to disembowel her foe. Rubbing her upper\r\nwings together, she entones a sort of war-song, a dull buzzing. The\r\nScorpion does not leave her time to finish her ditty; he brings his\r\ntail into play. The Mole-cricket’s thorax bears a stout, arched cuirass\r\nencasing the back. To the rear of this impenetrable armour there is a\r\ndeep crease, covered with fine skin. It is here that the sting enters.\r\nForthwith, without more ado, the monster is overthrown; she collapses,\r\nas though struck by lightning.\r\n\r\nDisorderly movements follow. The digging-legs are paralysed; they no\r\nlonger grip at the straw which I hold out to them. The others thresh to\r\nand fro, stretch out and flex themselves again; the four palpi with the\r\nlarge, fleshy tufts meet in a bunch, separate, come together again and\r\npat the object which I place within their reach; the antennæ wave\r\nfeebly; the belly throbs with deep pulsations. Gradually, these\r\ndeath-throes decrease in violence. At length, in a couple of hours’\r\ntime, the tarsi, the last to die, cease quivering. The clumsy creature\r\nhas succumbed no less completely than the Lycosa and the Mantis, but\r\nafter a longer death-struggle.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be ascertained whether the stab under the armour of the\r\nthorax does not possess a special efficiency, because of the proximity\r\nof the nerve-centres. I repeat the experiment with other patients and\r\nother operators. Sometimes the sting enters the chink in the armour;\r\nmore often it touches some part of the abdomen. In this case, even\r\nthough the stab is delivered at the extreme tip, the result is always\r\nsudden death. The only perceptible difference is that, instead of being\r\ninstantly paralyzed, the digging-legs continue for some time to\r\nstruggle like the rest. When struck by the Scorpion in any part\r\nwhatever, the Mole-cricket therefore is always mortally wounded; the\r\npowerful insect gives up the ghost after a few convulsive struggles.\r\n\r\nNow comes the turn of the Grey Locust, [23] the largest and most active\r\nof our Acridians. The Scorpion appears perturbed by the proximity of\r\nthis turbulent kicker. The Locust, on her side, would be only too well\r\npleased to get away. She hops and bumps against the pane of glass with\r\nwhich I have covered the arena to prevent escape. From time to time she\r\ndrops on the back of the Scorpion, who flees to avoid this sudden fall.\r\nAt last, losing patience, the runaway stings the Locust in the belly.\r\n\r\nThe shock must be of extraordinary violence, for one of the\r\nbig-haunched legs immediately falls off, through one of those\r\nspontaneous disarticulations to which Locusts and Grasshoppers are\r\naddicted at desperate moments. The other is paralyzed. Stretched\r\nstraight out and up, it is no longer able to obtain a purchase on the\r\nground. The Locust’s hopping-days are over. Meanwhile, the four front\r\nlegs make disorderly movements and are incapable of progression. When\r\nlaid on its side, the insect nevertheless turns over and resumes the\r\nnormal position, all but the large hind-leg, which is still impotent\r\nand sticking into the air.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes pass; and the insect falls, never to rise again. The\r\nspasms, the stretching of the legs, the quivering of the tarsi, the\r\nwaving of the antennæ continue for a long time yet. This condition,\r\nbecoming more and more aggravated, may last till next day; but\r\nsometimes the inertia is complete in less than an hour.\r\n\r\nAnother powerful Acridian, the Tryxalis [24], with the immensely long\r\nshanks and the sugar-loaf head, ends like the Locust: her death-agony\r\nlasts some hours. Among the sword-bearers, the Grasshoppers, I have\r\nseen this gradual paralysis, which is not yet death, but which is no\r\nlonger life, prolonged for a week. This time the subject is the Vine\r\nEphippiger. [25]\r\n\r\nThe pot-bellied creature has been stung in the abdomen. There are cries\r\nof distress from the cymbals at the moment of the wound; and the insect\r\nfalls on its side, with all the appearances of imminent death.\r\nNevertheless the wounded Ephippiger makes a fight for it. At the end of\r\ntwo days, she is kicking so hard with her ataxic legs, incapable of\r\nlocomotion, that the idea occurs to me to come to her assistance and\r\ndoctor her up a little. I administer as a cordial, on the tip of a\r\nstraw, some grape-juice, which is readily accepted.\r\n\r\nIt seems as though the draught is effectual; the insect appears to be\r\nrecovering. Nothing of the sort, alas! On the seventh day after the\r\nsting, the patient dies. The Scorpion’s sting is inexorable, for any\r\ninsect, even of the strongest. One dies on the spot; another lingers\r\nfor days; but all succumb in the end. Even though my Ephippiger were to\r\nsurvive for a week, I should know better than to ascribe this to my\r\ndoctoring with grape-juice: the Grasshopper’s long resistance must be\r\nattributed to her temperament.\r\n\r\nWe must consider above all things the gravity of the wound, which\r\nvaries greatly according to the dose of poison injected. It is not in\r\nmy power to regulate its emission: besides, the Scorpion is freakish in\r\nthe flow of the poison from his phial: in one case he is stingy, and in\r\nanother prodigal. For this reason the discrepancy is great between the\r\ndata furnished by the Ephippiger. My notes speak of subjects succumbing\r\nafter a brief interval, whereas others, more numerous, take a long time\r\nto die.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the Grasshoppers resist better than the Locusts. The\r\nEphippiger bears witness to this and, next to her, so does the\r\nWhite-faced Decticus, [26] the chief of the sword-bearing clan. The\r\ninsect with the large mandibles and the ivory head is stabbed near the\r\nmiddle of the abdomen, on the dorsal surface. The wounded Decticus,\r\napparently not gravely injured, walks about and tries to hop. Half an\r\nhour later, however, the poison is working. The abdomen is convulsed,\r\ncurves into a wide hook and, with its open gap, incapable of closing,\r\nplows through the rough surface of the soil. The proud creature has\r\nbecome a pitiful cripple. Six hours later, the insect is lying on its\r\nside. It exhausts itself in unsuccessful attempts to rise on its feet.\r\nLittle by little, the crisis subsides. On the second day, the Decticus\r\nis dead, really dead: not a limb stirs.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon, the great black-and-yellow Dragon-fly flies to\r\nand fro in a straight line, swiftly and silently, along the hedges. She\r\nis the corsair who levies tribute on all who navigate those peaceful\r\nwaters. Her ardent life, her fiery activity point to a more delicate\r\nnervous system than that of the Locust, the placid ruminant of the\r\npastures. And in fact, when stung by the Scorpion, she dies almost as\r\nquickly as the Praying Mantis.\r\n\r\nThe Cicada, [27] another spendthrift of energy, who from morning till\r\nnight, in the dog-days, never ceases singing by jerking his abdomen up\r\nand down, beating time to the cadence of his cymbals, likewise dies\r\nvery speedily. Talents have to be paid for: where the dull-witted hold\r\nout, the gifted succumb.\r\n\r\nThe large Beetles, in their horny armour, are invulnerable. Never will\r\nthe Scorpion, a clumsy fencer who lunges at random, find the narrow\r\njoints in their breast-plates. As for piercing the hard wrapper at some\r\nspot or another, this would need a protracted effort, which the patient\r\nwould hardly permit in the scuffle of his defence. Besides, these\r\nboring-tactics are unknown to the brutal Scorpion, who delivers a\r\nsudden stab.\r\n\r\nOne region alone lends itself to the sudden onslaught of the sting.\r\nThis is the upper surface of the abdomen, which is quite soft and\r\nprotected by the wing-cases. I uncover this region by holding up the\r\nwings and wing-cases with a pair of tweezers; or again I first remove\r\nboth with the scissors. This mutilation is not a serious matter and\r\nwould not prevent the patient from surviving quite a long time. The\r\ninsect is presented to the Scorpion in this condition. It is chosen\r\namong the largest, Oryctes, [28] Capricorn, [29] Scarab, [30] Carabus,\r\n[31] Cetonia, [32] Cockchafer, [33] Geotrupes. [34]\r\n\r\nAll perish by the sting, but the length of the death-struggle varies\r\nvery greatly. To give a few examples: after convulsive stretching of\r\nthe limbs, the Scarab Beetle hoists himself on his legs as high as he\r\ncan, hunches his back and marks time, for lack of co-ordination in the\r\nlocomotor mechanism. He capsizes, incapable of recovering his footing;\r\nhe kicks wildly. At length, in a few hours, immobility sets in; the\r\ninsect is dead.\r\n\r\nThe Capricorns, Cerambyx heros, who lives in the oak, and C. cerdo, who\r\nlives in the hawthorn and the cherry-laurel, begin in the same way with\r\na sort of cataleptic fit which sometimes lasts for a fairly long time.\r\nTo some of them death does not come until the next day; others are\r\nunable to hold out for more than three or four hours.\r\n\r\nThe result is the same with the Cetonia or Rose-chafer, the Common\r\nCockchafer, and the magnificently antlered Pine-chafer. [35]\r\n\r\nA pitiful sight is that of the Golden Carabus, or Gold Beetle, [36]\r\ndying of the sting. Unable to stand on its legs convulsively extended\r\ninto stilts, the insect tumbles over, picks itself up again, again\r\nfalls down and again hoists itself to its feet, only to fall once more.\r\nThe tip of the intestine, with its horny armour, sticks out and swells\r\nas though the creature were about to discharge its entrails; the crop\r\nbelches a black torrent that swamps the head; the golden wing-cases,\r\nlifting their cuirass, reveal the poor nudities of the abdomen. Next\r\nmorning, the tarsi are still quivering. Death is not far off. The\r\nswarthy Procrustes, the Gold Beetles’s near kinsman, comes to his end\r\nin the same wretched fashion. To him we shall return.\r\n\r\nWould you, on the other hand, see a stoic, who knows how to die\r\ndecently? Make the Scorpion sting Oryctes nasicornis, commonly known as\r\nthe Rhinoceros. None of our beetles equals him for hardy bearing.\r\nDespite the horn on his nose, he is a peace-lover, dwelling, during his\r\nlarval period, in old olive-stumps. When stabbed by the Scorpion, he\r\nseems at first to feel nothing. He walks about soberly, as usual, and\r\nkeeps his balance.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the atrocious poison works. The legs no longer obey with\r\ntheir customary accuracy; the wounded Beetle staggers and falls on his\r\nback. He will never rise again. Lying in this posture for three or four\r\ndays, with no struggle beyond some vague dying movements, he very\r\nquietly gives up the ghost.\r\n\r\nHow do the Moths and Butterflies behave in their turn? These delicate\r\ncreatures must be very sensitive to the sting; I am persuaded of it\r\nbefore I put them to the test. Nevertheless, as scrupulous observers,\r\nlet us experiment. A Swallowtail and a Vulcan perish the moment they\r\nare stung. I expected it. The Spurge Hawk-moth and the Striped\r\nHawk-moth offer no more resistance: they too suffer sudden death, just\r\nlike the Dragon-fly, the Lycosa and the Mantis.\r\n\r\nBut, to my great surprise, the Great Peacock Moth seems invulnerable.\r\nTrue, the attack is difficult to deliver. The sting goes astray in the\r\nsoft down, which at each stroke flies away in flocks. Despite repeated\r\nblows, I am not sure whether the sting has actually struck home. I\r\naccordingly strip the abdomen laying bare the skin. After taking this\r\nprecaution, I plainly see the weapon driven in. Penetration is now\r\nindubitable; it was preceded by other, more doubtful stabs; and yet the\r\nbig Moth remains impassive.\r\n\r\nI place her under a wire-gauze cover standing on the table. She grips\r\nthe trellis-work and remains there all day long without moving. The\r\nwings, outspread to their full width, give not a quiver. Next morning\r\nthere is no change: the victim of the operation is still hanging to the\r\nwires by the hooks of her front tarsi. I remove her and lay her on the\r\ntable, with her belly uppermost. The big body shakes with rapid\r\ntremors. Is this the end?\r\n\r\nNot at all. The apparently dying Moth revives, flaps her wings and with\r\na sudden effort, recovers her feet. She climbs up the trellis and again\r\nhangs from it. In the afternoon, I lay her on her back for the second\r\ntime. The wings are actuated by a gentle movement, almost a shudder, as\r\na result of which the prostrate insect glides over the table. It climbs\r\nup the trellis again and all movement ceases.\r\n\r\nLet us leave the poor Moth in peace: when she is really no more, she\r\nwill drop off. Well, the fall does not take place until the fourth day\r\nafter the sting or stings. Life is exhausted. The deceased is a female.\r\nThe force of maternity, stronger than any mortal terror, postpones\r\ndeath’s hour: the Moth laid her eggs before she died.\r\n\r\nShould we entertain the very natural thought of attributing this long\r\nresistance to the colossus’ powerful constitution, the frail product of\r\nour Silkworm nurseries, the Mulberry Bombyx, would tell us that we must\r\nseek the cause elsewhere. He, the infirm dwarf who has just the\r\nstrength to beat his wings and flutter round his female, offers no less\r\nresistance to the sting than the Great Peacock. The reason for this\r\npassivity is probably as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Great Peacock and the Mulberry-moth are incomplete entities, very\r\ndifferent from the Hawk-moth, that ardent explorer of corollas in the\r\ngloaming, and the Swallowtail Butterfly and the Mulberry-moth, those\r\nuntiring pilgrims to the chapel of flowers. They have no mouth\r\nimplements; they take no nourishment. Deprived of the stimulus of food,\r\nthey live but a few days, long enough to lay fertile eggs. This\r\ndiminished vitality must go with a no less delicate and consequently\r\nless fragile organism.\r\n\r\nLet us descend a few steps in the series of the segmented animals and\r\nquestion the uncouth Millipede. The Scorpion knows him. The colony in\r\nthe enclosure has shown me the Scorpion feeding on the Cryptops and the\r\nLithobius, the result of his hunting. These to him are harmless\r\nmouthfuls, incapable of defence. I propose to-day to place him in touch\r\nwith the Great Centipede known as the Scolopendra (Smorsitans), the\r\nmightiest of our Myriapods.\r\n\r\nThe dragon with the twenty-two pairs of legs is no stranger to him. I\r\nhave sometimes found the two together under the same stone. The\r\nScorpion was at home; the other roaming about at night, had taken\r\ntemporary shelter there. No regrettable incident had ensued from their\r\ncohabitation. Is this always so? We shall see.\r\n\r\nI confront the two horrors with each other in a large glass jar\r\ncontaining sand. The Centipede goes round and round, hugging the wall\r\nof the arena. He is an undulating ribbon, a finger’s breadth wide, four\r\nor five inches long and ringed with greenish rings on an amber-coloured\r\nground. The long, vibrating antennæ sound the space before him; their\r\ntips, sensitive as a finger, encounter the motionless Scorpion. The\r\nstartled animal instantly turns tail. His circuit brings him back to\r\nthe foe. There is a fresh contact, followed by a fresh flight.\r\n\r\nBut the Scorpion is now on his guard, with his arched tail advanced and\r\nhis pincers open. When the Centipede returns to the dangerous point of\r\nhis circular track, he is seized with the claws, in the neighbourhood\r\nof the head. In vain does the long, flexible animal twine and twist;\r\nimperturbably, the Scorpion grips it more firmly than ever with his\r\npincers; and no jerks, windings or unwindings succeed in making him let\r\ngo.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sting is at work. Three and four times over it is driven\r\ninto the sides of the Myriapod, who, for his part, opens wide his\r\npoison-fangs and strives to bite, without succeeding in doing so, for\r\nthe front part of his body is held in the stubborn pincers. The hinder\r\npart alone struggles and wriggles, coils and uncoils. These efforts are\r\nuseless. Kept at a distance by the long tongs, the Scolopendra’s\r\npoisoned fangs are unable to act. I have seen many insect battles; I\r\nknow none more horrible than that between these two monstrosities. It\r\nis enough to make your flesh creep.\r\n\r\nA lull enables me to part the combatants and isolate them. The\r\nCentipede licks his bleeding wounds and recovers his strength in a few\r\nhours. As for the Scorpion, he has suffered no damage. Next day, a\r\nfresh assault is delivered. Three times in succession the Myriapod is\r\nstabbed, till the blood flows. Then, fearing reprisals, the Scorpion\r\nwithdraws, as though frightened by his victory. The wounded animal does\r\nnot strike back and continues its circular flight. This is enough for\r\nto-day. I surround the jar with a cardboard cylinder. When darkness is\r\nthus produced, they will both keep quiet.\r\n\r\nWhat happens afterwards, especially at night, I do not know. Probably\r\nthe battle begins all over again and further thrusts of the sting are\r\ndelivered. At any rate the Centipede is much weaker on the third day.\r\nOn the fourth, he is dying. The Scorpion watches him without yet daring\r\nto devour him. At last, when there is no more movement, the huge quarry\r\nis cut up; the head and then the first two segments are eaten. The dish\r\nis too copious; the remainder will go bad and be wasted. His exclusive\r\ntaste for fresh meat will prevent the Scorpion from touching it.\r\n\r\nThough stung seven times and oftener, the Centipede does not die until\r\nthe fourth day; stung once only, the powerful Lycosa perishes that very\r\ninstant. Death comes almost as quickly to the Praying Mantis, the\r\nSacred Beetle, the Mole-cricket and other hardy specimens which, if\r\nimpaled by the collector, would kick and struggle for weeks on the cork\r\nslab. Any insect stabbed by the sting finds itself forthwith in a\r\nparlous plight; the longest-lived are dead within twenty-four hours;\r\nand here we have the Centipedes, pinked seven times over, holding out\r\nfor four days and perhaps dying from loss of blood as much as from the\r\neffects of the poison.\r\n\r\nWhy these points of difference? Apparently they are a matter of\r\norganisation. Life is an equilibrium whose stability varies according\r\nto the position in the hierarchy. At the top of the ladder, a fall is\r\neasy; at the bottom, there is a firm foothold. The finely-organised\r\ninsect succumbs, whereas the coarser Millipede resists. Is this really\r\nthe explanation? The Mole-cricket leaves us undecided. He, the boor,\r\nperishes just as quickly as do those refined creatures, the Butterfly\r\nand the Mantis. No, we do not yet know the secret which the Scorpion\r\nconceals in the phial at the end of his tail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE LANGUEDOCIAN SCORPION: THE IMMUNITY OF LARVÆ\r\n\r\n\r\nSo little do we possess the Scorpion’s secret that unexpected facts\r\ncrop up that strangely complicate the problem. The study of life brings\r\nus these surprises. Repeated experiments, with mutually consistent\r\nresults, seem to justify our formulation of a rule when, suddenly,\r\nimportant exceptions arise, compelling us to follow a fresh path,\r\ndirectly opposed to the first, and leading us to doubt which is the\r\nlast stage on the road to knowledge. After labouring long and\r\npatiently, like an ox yoked to the plow, we have to plant a note of\r\ninterrogation at the end of the field which we thought that we had made\r\nready for sowing, without any hope of a final answer. One question\r\nleads to another.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Cetonia-larvæ have forced upon me a similar change of\r\nopinion. It was at the end of November, late in the year, when the\r\nadult insect was becoming scarce. At this season of dearth, for lack of\r\nanything better wherewith to continue my experiments, I thought of\r\nresorting to the grubs of the Cetonia, grubs which abound all the year\r\nthrough in a heap of dead leaves in a corner of the enclosure. The\r\nnaturalist who questions animals is necessarily a torturer: there is no\r\nother means of making them speak. A host of questions therefore sends\r\nmy curiosity rummaging, as a regular thing, in that heap of leaf-mould.\r\nEvery physiological laboratory has its appointed victims: the Frog, the\r\nGuinea-pig, even the Dog. The Cetonia-larva suffices for my rustic\r\nwork-shop. I add the humble grub to the noble series of victims of\r\nwhose suffering our knowledge is born.\r\n\r\nThe advanced and already cold season has not slackened the Scorpion’s\r\nactivity; the fat grub, on its part, in the warm moisture of the\r\ndecayed leaves, has retained all the suppleness of its back. Both are\r\nin perfect condition. I bring them face to face.\r\n\r\nThe attack is not spontaneous. The larva flees obstinately, turned over\r\non its back, skirting the wall of the cage. The Scorpion remains\r\nmotionless and looks on; he draws to one side and makes way when the\r\ncircular track brings the creature in his direction. It is not a prey\r\nto his liking, still less a dangerous adversary; and killing merely for\r\nkilling’s sake is not one of his vices. If I did not interfere, the\r\npeaceful encounter might continue indefinitely.\r\n\r\nI worry the two of them, bring them into contact, irritate them with a\r\nbit of a straw, to such good purposes that my devices look like an\r\nattack on the part of the grub. The poor topsy-turvy creature is\r\ncertainly not dreaming of fighting; it is a natural coward which, when\r\nin danger, curls up and refuses to move. Unaware of my tricks with the\r\nstraw, the Scorpion ascribes to his innocent neighbour the annoyance of\r\nwhich I alone am the cause. He waves his sting on high and stabs. The\r\nblow has struck home, for the wound bleeds.\r\n\r\nRelying on what the adult Cetonia showed me, I expect to see\r\nconvulsions, the preludes of death. But what is this? When left to\r\nitself, the grub uncoils itself and makes off; it travels on its back\r\nneither faster nor slower than usual, as though it had not been\r\nwounded. Laid on the heap of leaf-mould, it swiftly dives down, without\r\nappearing in the least injured. I go to look at it a couple of hours\r\nlater. It is as vigorous as before the experiment. Its state of health\r\nis the same the next day. What are we to make of this rebel? In its\r\nadult form, it would have dropped dead; in its larval form, it is\r\nindomitable. The wound was deep, since it bleeds, but perhaps the sting\r\nomitted to inject any poison, in which case it is a harmless prick, a\r\nnegligible accident for the sturdy grub. We must try again.\r\n\r\nThe same subject is stung a second time, by another Scorpion. The\r\nresult agrees with the first. The wounded grub ambles along on its back\r\nentirely at its ease; it dips down into the layer of rotten leaves and\r\nquietly resumes eating. The poisoned stab has not affected it.\r\n\r\nThis immunity cannot be an exceptional instance; there are no\r\nprivileged individuals among the Cetoniæ; any other subject of the same\r\nspecies ought to prove equally refractory. I unearth twelve larvæ and\r\nhave them stung, some of them twice or thrice in quick succession. All\r\nwriggle a little at the moment when the dirk enters; all lick the\r\nbleeding spot if they can reach it with their mouth and then quietly\r\nrecover from their excitement. They amble along, with their legs in the\r\nair; they burrow down into the heart of the leaf-mould. I inspect them\r\nnext day, the day after and the following days. The poison does not\r\nseem to have endangered them in any way.\r\n\r\nThey look so fit that I conceive a hope of rearing them. In this I\r\nsucceed to perfection, without further trouble than that of renewing\r\nfrom time to time the provision of rotten leaves. The following year,\r\nin June, the twelve that have been subjected to the atrocious sting\r\nweave their cocoons and undergo metamorphosis. The Scorpion’s stab has\r\ncaused them no worse damage than a slight itching at the moment when\r\nthe sting entered the belly.\r\n\r\nThis curious result reminds me of what Lenz tells us on the subject of\r\nthe Hedgehog:\r\n\r\n“I had a mother Hedgehog,” he writes, “who was suckling her young. I\r\nthrew a large Viper into her box. The Hedgehog soon felt that he was\r\nthere, for she is guided by the sense of smell and not of sight. She\r\ngot up, went fearlessly to the Snake and sniffed at him from head to\r\nfoot, especially about the mouth. The Viper hissed and bit her several\r\ntimes on the snout and lips. As though to make fun of her feeble\r\nassailant, she contented herself with licking her wounds, continued her\r\ninspection and was once more bitten, but this time in the tongue. At\r\nlast, she seized the Viper by the head, which she crunched between her\r\njaws, together with the poison-fangs and glands. Then she devoured half\r\nthe reptile, after which she returned to lie down beside her young and\r\ngive them to suck. That evening she ate another Viper and what remained\r\nof the first. Her health was not affected thereby, nor was that of the\r\nlittle Hedgehogs; her wounds did not even swell.\r\n\r\n“Two days later, there was a new Viper and a new fight. The Hedgehog\r\nwent up to the reptile and smelt it. Opening her jaws and erecting her\r\npoison-fangs, the Viper rushed upon her, bit her in the upper lip and\r\nremained hanging there for a time. The Hedgehog shook him off and,\r\nthough bitten ten times in the muzzle and twenty times elsewhere,\r\namidst the prickles, she seized him by the head and devoured him\r\nslowly, notwithstanding his contortions. This time again neither the\r\nmother nor the sucklings seemed unwell.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that Mithridates, King of Pontus, to fortify his\r\nconstitution against the dangerous potions with which his enemies\r\nattempted to destroy him, accustomed himself to different poisons. By\r\ndegrees he inured his stomach against venom. Can the Hedgehog, that new\r\nMithridates, in her quality as a Snake-eater, have acquired her\r\nimmunity by gradual use and wont? Or is it not rather in her case, an\r\noriginal aptitude? When for the first time she bit into the reptile’s\r\nhead, did she not already possess the predisposition necessary to her\r\nsafety?\r\n\r\nShe did, the Cetonia-larva tells us for our answer. If any members of\r\nthe insect clan has to provide itself with defensive means against the\r\nScorpion’s attacks, it is certainly not the grub that dwells amid\r\nvegetable decay. The two do not frequent the same places, which makes\r\nmeetings almost impossible. On the larva’s part, therefore, there is no\r\nincreasing tolerance of the poison. The first to find themselves in the\r\nScorpion’s presence are perhaps those which I myself place there.\r\nNevertheless, without preparations of any kind, behold the grub\r\nrefractory to the sting. It possesses, from the first, powers of\r\nresistance to the poison which is quite as surprising as that of the\r\nreptile-eater.\r\n\r\nThat the Hedgehog, the appointed exterminator of Vipers, should be\r\nendowed with the prerogatives essential to her calling is strictly\r\nlogical. In the same way, the Bee-eater, the handsomest bird of\r\nMediterranean provinces, crams his crop with impunity with live Wasps;\r\nin the same way, the Cuckoo suffers from no irritation when he fills\r\nhis stomach with a barbed wire entanglement of stinging hairs from the\r\nProcessionary Caterpillar. [37] The function exercised will have it so.\r\n\r\nBut why need the larva of the Cetonia safeguard itself against the\r\nScorpion, whom she probably never meets? We dare not believe in\r\nprivileges; rather do we suspect a general aptitude. The Cetonia-larva\r\nresists the Scorpion’s sting, not as a Cetonia, but as a grub, a\r\npreparatory phase on the way to a higher organization. If so, all the\r\nlarvæ, in a greater or lesser degree, according to their robustness,\r\nmust possess similar powers of resistance.\r\n\r\nWhat does experiment say on the subject? It behooves us to exempt from\r\nthe test the weaker grubs, of a delicate constitution. To them a mere\r\nprick, without the aid of the poison, would mean a serious and often\r\nfatal wound. The point of a needle would gravely injure them. What\r\nwould it be with the brutal stiletto, even though not poisoned? What we\r\nneed is a few corpulent grubs which would think little of a perforated\r\nbelly.\r\n\r\nAnd here I have the very thing I want. An old olive-stump softened\r\nunderground by decay, provides me with the larva of the Rhinoceros\r\nBeetle. It is a plump sausage, as thick as a man’s thumb. When stung by\r\nthe Scorpion, the paunchy grub glides among the scraps of decayed\r\nolive-wood with which I have furnished a glass jar; heedless of its\r\nmishap, it works its jaws so lustily that, eight months later, having\r\nthrived and waxed fat, it is preparing its cell for the metamorphosis.\r\nIt has passed through the dreadful ordeal unscathed.\r\n\r\nAs for the adult insect, we have already seen what it does. Stung on\r\nthe upper surface of the abdomen, under the lifted wing-cases, the\r\ncolossus soon topples over and feebly kicks its legs about in the air.\r\nAll movement ceases in three or four days at most. The powerful\r\ncreature dies; its grub loses nothing in either strength or appetite.\r\n\r\nThis instance of correct prevision on my part is confirmed by a number\r\nof others. In front of my door are two old cherry-laurels,\r\nmagnificently green at all times of the year. A Capricorn is ruining\r\nthem for me. This is the little Cerambyx cerdo, the usual inhabitant of\r\nthe hawthorn. The aroma of prussic acid, instead of repelling him,\r\nattracts him; the horned dandy is well acquainted with it, thanks to\r\nhis long experience of the clusters of the hawthorn-blossoms with their\r\nsearching smell. This alien tree suits him so well for establishing his\r\nfamily that the axe will have to intervene if I want to save what\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nI cut down the boughs that have suffered most damage. From one limb\r\nsplit into fragments I obtain a dozen of the Capricorn’s larvæ. My\r\ninspection of the neighbouring hedge-rows provides me with the perfect\r\ninsect. And now we’ll have it out together, O destroyer of my leafy\r\narbour! You shall make amends to me for your misdeeds; you shall die by\r\nthe Scorpion.\r\n\r\nThe adults indeed succumb; but the larvæ resist. Lodged in a glass jar,\r\nwith tiny morsels of the demolished tree, they quietly resume their\r\ngnawing. If the provisions do not dry up, the grubs wounded by the\r\nScorpion complete their larval life without accident.\r\n\r\nThe Capricorn of the Oak, Cerambyx heros, behaves in a like fashion.\r\nThe great horn-wearer perishes; his grub does not mind the sting a jot,\r\nfor, when restored to its place in the gallery, it tunnels the wood as\r\nit did before and completes its development.\r\n\r\nThe result is the same with the Common Cockchafer. The stabbed insect\r\ndies in a few minutes; the White Worm, [38] on the contrary, holds out,\r\ngoes underground and climbs back to the surface to gnaw the\r\nlettuce-stalk which I have given it. If my patience as an insect-rearer\r\ndid not tire, the victim of the accident, from which it quickly\r\nrecovers, would become a Cockchafer, as may be seen from the paunch\r\nsleek and glossy with health.\r\n\r\nA near kinsman of the Stag-beetle, Dorcus parallelopipedus, whose larva\r\nI find in an old tamarisk-stump, adds his evidence to that of the\r\nabove: the adult insect dies, the larva resists. These instances are\r\nsufficient; there is no need to continue on these lines.\r\n\r\nCetonia-, Oryctes-, Capricorn-, Cockchafer- and Dorcus-grubs are fat\r\ncreatures, addicted to a vegetarian diet. Do these plump larvæ owe\r\ntheir immunity to the nature of their victuals? Or, on the other hand,\r\ncan the fatty stratum, in which the reserves of these insatiable eaters\r\naccumulate, neutralize the virulence of the sting? Let us enquire of\r\nsome lean flesh-eaters.\r\n\r\nI choose the largest of our Ground-Beetles, Procrusies coriaceus, a\r\nsaturnine hunter whom I meet at the foot of the walls, disembowelling a\r\nSnail. A bold highwayman and built for fighting, he welds his\r\nwing-cases into an inviolable cuirass. I pare away a little of his\r\narmour behind, in order to render accessible to the Scorpion’s sting\r\nthe only penetrable part, the upper surface of the abdomen.\r\n\r\nWe see a repetition of the Gold Beetle’s wretched end. The fight\r\nagainst the agonies of the sting would strike us with horror, if things\r\nwere happening in a higher world. Thus struggles a Dog tortured by the\r\nmunicipal sausage seasoned with strychnine. At first the wounded Beetle\r\nscurries off desperately. Suddenly, he stops and raises himself high on\r\nhis stiffened legs; he lifts his hinder part, lowers his head and\r\nsupports himself on his mandibles as though about to turn a somersault.\r\nA jolt topples him over. He falls; quickly he stands up again and\r\nresumes his unnatural attitude. To look at him you would say that his\r\njoints were controlled by wires. He is like an automaton worked by a\r\njerky spring. Another shake, another fall, another recovery: and this\r\ngoes on for twenty minutes or so. At last the demented Beetle collapses\r\non his back and does not get up again, though his limbs continue to\r\nmove. Next morning he is absolutely motionless.\r\n\r\nAnd what of the larva? Well, though destitute of the layer of fat which\r\nwould seem to protect the grubs of the Cetonia, the Oryctes and the\r\nothers, the meagre grub of the Procrustes is so little harmed by the\r\nScorpion’s sting that, a fortnight after the ordeal, it buries itself\r\nin the ground and digs itself a cell in which the transformation is\r\neffected. Lastly, not long after, the adult emerges from the soil in\r\nperfect health. Therefore neither the diet nor the degree of stoutness\r\nis responsible for this immunity.\r\n\r\nNor is the place occupied in the entomological series, as the Moths\r\nwill tell us, now that the Beetles have spoken. The first to be\r\nquestioned is the Zeuzera, whose caterpillar has a calamitous effect\r\nupon various trees and shrubs. I take a mother at the moment when she\r\nis slipping her long ovipositor into the crevices in the bark of a\r\nlilac-tree, to lay her eggs. She is magnificent in her white costume\r\nadorned with steel-blue spots. [39] I place her at the Scorpion’s\r\nmercy. The business is not protracted. No sooner is the Zeuzera stung\r\nthan she dies, with no disordered motions. Death is gentle to her.\r\n\r\nAnd the caterpillar? After the prick, the caterpillar is as well as\r\nbefore. Restored to the gallery whence I extracted it by splitting its\r\nlilac-branch, it works away busily as usual: I can see this by the\r\nsawdust ejected through the orifice of the cell. The chrysalis and the\r\nMoth come in the summer, according to rule.\r\n\r\nThe Silkworm, which I am able to procure in such numbers as I require\r\nfrom the nurseries at the farms hard by, lends itself much better to\r\nexperiment. At the end of May, when the rearing is nearly finished, I\r\ncause a couple of dozen to be stung. The worms have a fine, chubby\r\nskin, into which the sting each time enters easily, producing a copious\r\nhemorrhage. The little table on which my curiosity drives me to\r\nperpetrate these barbarities is soon covered with splashes of blood\r\nlike drops of liquid amber.\r\n\r\nWhen restored to their litter of mulberry-leaves, the wounded almost at\r\nonce set to browsing with their usual appetite. Ten days later, all,\r\nfrom the first to the last, weave their cocoons, which are perfectly\r\nnormal in shape and thickness. Lastly, from these cocoons, without any\r\nlosses, emerge Moths whom we shall presently question in another\r\nconnection. For the moment it is proved that the Silkworm resists the\r\nScorpion’s sting. As for the Moth herself, we know what becomes of her.\r\nShe succumbs slowly, it it true, after the manner of the Great Peacock;\r\nbut at all events she succumbs: the sting is always fatal.\r\n\r\nThe Spurge Hawk-moth gives the same answer: the Moth dies quickly: the\r\ncaterpillar defies the sting, eats its fill and then goes underground\r\nitself into a chrysalis under a coarse veil of sand and silk.\r\nNevertheless, among the number operated upon, there are some which are\r\nstabbed to death, perhaps because of the multiplicity of their wounds.\r\nThe skin offers a certain resistance to perforation and the discharge\r\nof blood remains uncertain, leaving me undecided as to the efficiency\r\nof the stab. I was obliged to prolong the struggle until the evidence\r\nwas complete and it is probable that I sometimes went too far. The\r\ncaterpillar which, if pricked but once, would have withstood the ordeal\r\nas sturdily as the Silkworm perishes from an overdose.\r\n\r\nThe mighty, turquoise-bedecked caterpillar of the Great Peacock\r\nsupplies me with very definite results. When pricked till the blood\r\ncomes and then replaced on its grazing-ground, the branch of almond, it\r\ncompletes its development and accurately spins its ingenious cocoon.\r\n\r\nThe Dipteron [40] and the Hymenopteron [41] should be worth\r\nexamination. Like the Moth and the Beetle, they undergo a general\r\nremoulding through the action of the metamorphosis; but they are\r\nsmall-sized and for the most part could not be easily manipulated were\r\nmy tweezers to present them to the sting. Their delicate larvæ would\r\ndie merely of the perforation of the skin. Let us question only the\r\ngiants.\r\n\r\nThese latter include various Orthoptera, [42] the Tryxalis, the Grey\r\nLocust, the White-faced Decticus, the Mole-cricket, the Mantis. As we\r\nhave already seen, all these succumb when struck by the Scorpion’s\r\nsting. Now, in their group, the complete development essential to the\r\nfestival of the pairing is preceded by a transition-form which, without\r\nbeing actually larval, and presenting no likeness whatever to the\r\nadult, constitutes an inferior stage, a step towards the marriageable.\r\n\r\nThe Grey Locust, as we see him on the vine at vintage-time, does not\r\nyet possess his magnificent network wings, nor his leathery wing-cases;\r\nhe possesses only their rudiments, reduced to skimpy coat-tails. The\r\nMole-cricket, who ends by displaying an ample set of wings, which fold\r\nback into a sharp tail and enclose the tip of the abdomen, has at first\r\nonly ungainly stumps, fastened to the upper part of the back.\r\n\r\nWe behold the same sign of juvenile inferiority in the young Tryxalis,\r\nthe young Decticus and the others. These mighty, aerial sailing-craft\r\nof the future have their canvas enclosed in the germ, in mean-looking\r\nsheaths. As for the rest, the insect is, from the beginning, very\r\nnearly what it will be in all the fullness of its finery. Age develops\r\nand does not transform the Orthopteron.\r\n\r\nNow are these incomplete insects, with wing-stumps in the place of\r\nwings, are these young insects capable of withstanding the Scorpion’s\r\nsting as do the true larvæ, the babes of the Oryctes and the Capricorn,\r\nthe caterpillar of the Hawk-moth and the Bombyx? If the generous sap of\r\nyouth is an adequate preservative, we ought to find immunity here. We\r\nfind nothing of the sort. With wings or without, old or young, the\r\nMole-cricket perishes. The Mantis, the Locust, the Tryxalis, whether\r\nadult or incomplete, perish likewise.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of resistance to the Scorpion’s poison we are therefore\r\nled to class insects in two categories: on the one hand, those which\r\nundergo a real transformation, accompanied by an alteration of the\r\nwhole organism; on the other hand, those which undergo only secondary\r\nmodifications. In the first division, the larva resists and the adult\r\ndies; in the second, death invariably ensues.\r\n\r\nWhat reason can we discover for this difference? Experiment shows us\r\nfirst that resistance to the sting increases as the nature of the\r\nvictim becomes less highly organized. The Lycosa, the Epeira, the\r\nMantis, all exceedingly sensitive to impressions, succumb on the\r\ninstant, as though struck by lightning; the Gold Beetle and the\r\nProcrustes, those strenuous livers, are seized forthwith with\r\nconvulsions similar to those produced by strychnine; the Sacred Beetle,\r\na spirited pill-roller, prances in a sort of St. Vitus’ dance. On the\r\nother hand, the sluggish Oryctes, the lazy Cetonia, both lovers of\r\nprotracted slumbers in the heart of the roses, bear their misfortunes\r\npatiently and fidget feebly for whole days on end before giving up the\r\nghost. Beneath them is the Acridian, the Locust, the essential rustic.\r\nLower still comes the Centipede, an inferior being, roughly organized.\r\nIt is evident therefore that the venom acts more quickly or more slowly\r\naccording to the patient’s nervous constitution.\r\n\r\nLet us consider separately the insects of a superior order, subject to\r\ncomplete transformations. The word metamorphosis applied to them means\r\na change of form. Now is it only the shape that changes when the\r\ncaterpillar turns into a Moth, or when the grub in the leaf-mould\r\nbecomes a Cetonia? More than this occurs and much more, as the\r\nScorpion’s sting informs us.\r\n\r\nA profound and comprehensive renewal is effected in the vital statics\r\nof the metamorphosed insect; the substance, which is actually still the\r\nsame, enters into fusion, subtilizes its atomic structure and becomes\r\nliable to sensory vibrations which are the first appanage of the nubile\r\nspecimen. The armour of the wing-cases, the blades, tufts and quivering\r\nstems of the antennæ, the legs fit for running and wings fit for\r\nflying: all these are magnificent and yet all these are nothing.\r\n\r\nSomething else towers high above them. The transformed insect has\r\nacquired a new life, more active and richer in sensations. A second\r\nbirth has taken place in which all is renewed, in the invisible and\r\nintangible even more than in the material domain. It is more than a\r\nmolecular rearrangement; it is the development of aptitudes unknown in\r\nthe past. The larva, generally a mere scrap of intestine, lived a\r\nplacid and very monotonous existence and lo, in view of the future\r\ninstincts, metamorphosis revolutionizes its substance, distils its\r\nhumours and refines the centres of energy atom by atom. An enormous\r\nleap is made towards progress, but the new state has not the sturdy\r\nequilibrium of the first, perfection has been gained at the cost of\r\nstability; and so the insect dies of an ordeal which the grub would\r\nsupport with impunity.\r\n\r\nWith the Acridians and the Orthoptera in general, conditions are quite\r\ndifferent. Here there is no real metamorphosis, utterly changing the\r\nstructure, the mode of life and the habits. The insect remains, all its\r\nlife long, very much what it was on leaving the egg. It is born in a\r\nshape which the future will hardly modify, with habits which will not\r\nbe altered by time. It undergoes no renovation, no sudden growth. In\r\nits infancy already it possesses the temperament of the adult; and as\r\nsuch it is deprived of the immunity enjoyed by rudimentary organisms.\r\n\r\nExempted from a probationary period in the grub state, the short-coated\r\nLocust suffers from the drawbacks of a too rapid development. He\r\nperishes as quickly as the adult, whom he resembles in all but a few\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nI will not deny that the explanation which I have given may not be the\r\nright one; and I will not insist upon it. A cast of the net into the\r\ndepths of the unknown does not always bring up to the surface the\r\ncorrect idea, a very rare catch. A far-reaching fact is acquired\r\nnevertheless, even though it remain unexplained. Metamorphosis modifies\r\nthe organic substance to the degree of changing its innermost\r\nproperties. The Scorpion’s poison, a reagent of transcendental\r\nchemistry, distinguishes the flesh of the larva from that of the adult;\r\nit is kindly to the first and deadly to the second.\r\n\r\nThis curious result raises a question which is not alien to the\r\nvainglorious theories affecting attenuated viruses, serums and\r\nvaccines. A larva subject to complete metamorphosis is stung by the\r\nScorpion; we might readily say that it has been vaccinated, in the\r\nsense that it has been inoculated with a virus fatal under the future\r\nconditions, but tolerable in its effects in the present stage. The\r\npatient does not seem affected by the sting; it begins to eat again and\r\ncontinues its larval work as usual.\r\n\r\nThe virus, however, cannot fail to act, in one way or another, on the\r\nanimal’s blood or nerves. Might it not lessen the vulnerability which\r\nresults from the transformation? Can the adult be rendered immune by a\r\nhabit acquired during the larval stage? Might it be able to resist the\r\nvirus as Mithridates was able to resist poison? In short, is the insect\r\nwith a complete metamorphosis whose larva has been stung capable of\r\nitself withstanding the sting? That is the question.\r\n\r\nThe confirmatory arguments are so urgent that we are at first tempted\r\nto answer:\r\n\r\n“Yes, the adult will resist.”\r\n\r\nBut we will leave experiment to speak for itself. With this object\r\npreparations are made with four sets of subjects. The first consists of\r\ntwelve Cetonia-larvæ, which, after being stung in October, have been\r\nrevaccinated, that is to say, stung a second time, in May. The second\r\nset is also composed of twelve Cetonia-larvæ, but these have been stung\r\nonce only, in May. Four chrysalids of the Spurge Hawk-moth form the\r\nthird. They belong to caterpillars stung once, in June. Lastly, I have\r\nsome cocoons spun by the Silkworm whose vaccination, attended by a flow\r\nof blood, I have described above. The Scorpion will once more play his\r\npart with each lot after the hatching has taken place.\r\n\r\nThe Silkworm Moth is the first to respond to my impatience. The Moth is\r\nthere in two or three weeks’ time, bustling about in readiness for the\r\npairing. The stab received as a caterpillar has not cooled his ardour\r\nin the very least. I subject him to the test. The attack is laboured\r\nand the blow is not clearly struck. No matter: all those attacked\r\nperish after a death-struggle lasting a day or two. The previous\r\nvaccination has made no difference to the result: they succumbed before\r\nand they succumb after.\r\n\r\nBut these are feeble witnesses, on whom it is not wise to rely. I shall\r\nachieve more, I feel convinced, with the Hawk-moths and especially with\r\nthose sturdy subjects the Cetoniæ. Well, the Hawk-moths whose\r\ncaterpillars have received the virus which theoretically should render\r\nthem immune retain their normal vulnerability: when attacked by the\r\nsting, they succumb instantly, exactly like the others, who did not at\r\nthe larval age undergo a preventative inoculation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the number of days elapsing between the stinging of the\r\ncaterpillar and of the moth was not sufficient to enable the virus to\r\nact upon the organism to the requisite degree. It might need a longer\r\nspace of time to bring about the inward modifications caused by the\r\naction of the poison on the insect’s organism. The Cetonia-larvæ will\r\nperhaps be able to dispense with this period.\r\n\r\nI have a set of twelve of them, stung twice over, first in October and\r\nthen in May. The perfect insect bursts its cocoon at the end of July.\r\nTen months therefore have elapsed since the first sting and three\r\nmonths since the second. Is the adult now immune?\r\n\r\nNot at all. When subjected to the Scorpion, my twelve vaccinated\r\nspecimens all perish, no more and no less quickly than their fellows\r\nwho were born quietly in their heap of rotten leaves. Twelve others,\r\npricked only once, in May, succumb with the same promptness. In the\r\ncase of both sets, my devices, which inspired me with confidence at\r\nfirst, miscarry pitifully, to my extreme confusion.\r\n\r\nI try another method, that of transfusion of blood, which is related to\r\nserotherapy. Since it resists the Scorpion’s sting, the larva of the\r\nCetonia must have blood endowed with special qualities, apt to\r\nneutralize the virulence of the poison. If transferred from the larva\r\nto the adult, might not this blood communicate its qualities and render\r\nthe perfect insect invulnerable?\r\n\r\nI give a Cetonia-grub a superficial wound with the point of a needle.\r\nThe blood spouts forth abundantly. I collect it in a watch-glass. A\r\nglass tube of small diameter, drawn out to a sharp point, serves as an\r\ninjector. I charge it by suction with the fluid collected, varying the\r\ndose from a cubic millimetre to ten and twenty times as much. By\r\nblowing into the tube I transfer the liquid into some point of the\r\nadult Cetonia, particularly on the ventral surface, where a needle has\r\nprepared the way for the fragile injector. The insect stands the\r\noperation very well. The richer by a little larval blood and not\r\nseriously wounded, it presents every appearance of blooming health.\r\n\r\nNow what comes of this treatment? Nothing at all. I wait a day or two\r\nto give the injected fluids time to diffuse and act. The Cetonia is\r\nthen presented to the Scorpion. Veil your face, O foolish physiologist:\r\nthe creature perishes as it would have done before your presumptuous\r\nattempts at surgery. We cannot manipulate animals as we can the\r\nreagents of chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE LANGUEDOCIAN SCORPION: PRELUDES TO THE WEDDING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April, when the Swallow returns to us and the Cuckoo sounds his\r\nfirst note, a revolution takes place among my hitherto peaceable\r\nScorpions. Several whom I have established in the colony in the\r\nenclosure, leave their shelter at nightfall, go wandering about and do\r\nnot return to their homes. A more serious business: often, under the\r\nsame stone, are two Scorpions of whom one is in the act of devouring\r\nthe other. Is this a case of brigandage among creatures of the same\r\norder, who, falling into vagabond ways when the fine weather sets in\r\nthoughtlessly enter their neighbours’ houses and there meet with their\r\nundoing unless they be the stronger? One would almost think it, so\r\nquickly is the intruder eaten up, for days at a time and in small\r\nmouthfuls, even as the usual game would be.\r\n\r\nNow here is something to give us a hint. The Scorpions devoured are\r\ninvariably of middling size. Their lighter colouring, their less\r\nprotuberant bellies, mark them as males, always males. The others,\r\nlarger, more paunchy and a little darker in shade, do not end in this\r\nunhappy fashion. So these are probably not brawls between neighbours\r\nwho, jealous of their solitude, would soon settle the hash of any\r\nvisitor and eat him afterwards, a drastic method of putting a stop to\r\nfurther indiscretions; they are rather nuptial rites, tragically\r\nperformed by the matron after pairing. To determine how much ground\r\nthere is for this suspicion is beyond my powers until next year: I am\r\nstill too badly equipped.\r\n\r\nSpring returns once more. I have prepared the large glass cage in\r\nadvance and stocked it with twenty-five inhabitants, each with his bit\r\nof crockery. From mid-April onwards, every evening, when it grows dark,\r\nbetween seven and nine o’clock, great animation reigns in the crystal\r\npalace. That which seemed deserted by day now becomes a scene of\r\nfestivity. As soon as supper is finished, the whole household runs out\r\nto look on. A lantern hung outside the panes allows us to follow\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nIt is our distraction after the worries of the day; it is our\r\nplay-house. In this theatre for simple folk, the performances are so\r\nhighly interesting that, the moment the lantern is lighted, all of us,\r\ngreat and small alike, come and take our places in the stalls; all,\r\ndown to Tom, the House-dog. Tom, it is true, indifferent to Scorpion\r\naffairs, like the true philosopher that he is, lies at our feet and\r\ndozes, but only with one eye, keeping the other always open on his\r\nfriends the children.\r\n\r\nLet me try to give the reader an idea of what happens. A numerous\r\nassembly soon gathers near the glass panes in the region discreetly lit\r\nby the lanterns. Every elsewhere, here, there, single Scorpions walk\r\nabout and, attracted by the light, leave the shade and hasten to the\r\nilluminated festival. The very Moths betray no greater eagerness to\r\nflutter to the rays of our lamps. The newcomers mingle with the crowd,\r\nwhile others, tired of their pastimes, withdraw into the shade, snatch\r\na few moments’ rest and then impetuously return upon the scene.\r\n\r\nThese hideous devotees of gaiety provide a dance that is not wholly\r\ndevoid of charm. Some come from afar: solemnly they emerge from the\r\nshadow; then, suddenly, with a rush as swift and easy as a slide, they\r\njoin the crowd, in the light. Their agility reminds one of Mice\r\nscurrying along with their tiny steps. They seek one another and fly\r\nprecipitately the moment they touch, as though they had mutually burnt\r\ntheir fingers. Others, after tumbling about a little with their\r\nplay-fellows, make off hurriedly wildly. They take fresh courage in the\r\ndark and return.\r\n\r\nAt times, there is a violent tumult: a confused mass of swarming legs,\r\nsnapping claws, tails curving and clashing, threatening or fondling, it\r\nis hard to say which. In this affray, under favourable conditions, twin\r\nspecks of light flare and shine like carbuncles. One would take them\r\nfor eyes that emit flashing glances; in reality they are two polished,\r\nreflecting facets, which occupy the front of the head. All, large and\r\nsmall alike, take part in the brawl; it might be a battle to the death,\r\na general massacre; and it is just a wanton frolic. Even so do kittens\r\nbemaul each other. Soon, the group disperses; all make off in all sorts\r\nof directions, without a scratch, without a sprain.\r\n\r\nBehold the fugitives collecting once more beneath the lantern. They\r\npass and pass again; they come and go, often meeting front to front. He\r\nwho is in the greatest hurry walks over the back of the other, who lets\r\nhim have his way without any protest but a movement of the body. It is\r\nno time for blows: at most, two Scorpions meeting will exchange a cuff,\r\nthat is to say, a rap of the caudal staff. In their community, this\r\nfriendly thump, in which the point of the sting plays no part, is a\r\nsort of a fisticuff in frequent use. There are better things than\r\nentangled legs and brandished tails; there are sometimes poses of the\r\nhighest originality. Face to face, with claws drawn back, two wrestlers\r\nproceed to stand on their heads like acrobats, that is to say, resting\r\nonly on the fore-quarters, they raise the whole hinder portion of the\r\nbody, so much so that the chest displays the four little lung pockets\r\nuncovered. Then the tails, held vertically erect in a straight line,\r\nexchange mutual rubs, gliding one over the other, while their\r\nextremities are hooked together and repeatedly fastened and unfastened.\r\nSuddenly, the friendly pyramid falls to pieces and each runs off\r\nhurriedly, without ceremony.\r\n\r\nWhat were these two wrestlers trying to do, in their eccentric posture?\r\nWas it a set-to between two rivals? It would seem not, so peaceful is\r\nthe encounter. My subsequent observations were to tell me that this was\r\nthe mutual teasing of a betrothed couple. To declare his flame, the\r\nScorpion stands on his head.\r\n\r\nTo continue as I have begun and give a homogeneous picture of the\r\nthousand tiny particulars gathered day by day would have its\r\nadvantages: the story would sooner be told; but, at the same time\r\ndeprived of its details, which vary greatly between one observation and\r\nthe next and are difficult to piece together, it would be less\r\ninteresting. Nothing must be neglected in the relation of manners so\r\nstrange and as yet so little known. At the risk of repeating one’s self\r\nhere and there, it is preferable to adhere to chronological order and\r\nto tell the story by fragments, as one’s observations reveal fresh\r\nfacts. Order will emerge from this disorder; for each of the more\r\nremarkable evenings supplies some feature that corroborates and\r\ncompletes those which go before. I will therefore continue my narration\r\nin the form of a diary.\r\n\r\n25th April, 1904.—Hullo! What is this, something I have not yet seen?\r\nMy eyes, ever on the watch, look upon the affair for the first time.\r\nTwo Scorpions face each other, with claws outstretched and fingers\r\nclasped. It is a question of a friendly grasp of the hand and not the\r\nprelude to a battle, for the two partners are behaving to each other in\r\nthe most peaceful way. There is one of either sex. One is paunchy and\r\nbrowner than the other: this is the female; the other is comparatively\r\nslim and pale: this is the male. With their tails prettily curled, the\r\ncouple stroll with measured steps along the pane. The male is ahead and\r\nwalks backwards, without jolt or jerk, without any resistance to\r\novercome. The female follows obediently, clasped by her finger-tips and\r\nface to face with her leader.\r\n\r\nThe stroll is interrupted by halts that do not affect the method of\r\nconjunction; it is resumed, now here, now there, from end to end of the\r\nenclosure. Nothing shows the object which the strollers have in view.\r\nThey loiter, they dawdle, they most certainly exchange ogling glances.\r\nEven so in my village, on Sundays, after vespers, do the youth of both\r\nsexes saunter along the hedges, every Jack with his Jill.\r\n\r\nOften they tack about. It is always the male who decides which fresh\r\ndirection the pair shall take. Without releasing her hands, he turns\r\ngracefully to the left or right about and places himself side by side\r\nwith his companion. Then, for a moment, with tail laid flat, he strokes\r\nher spine. The other stands motionless, impassive.\r\n\r\nFor over an hour, without tiring, I watch these interminable comings\r\nand goings. A part of the household lends me its eyes in the presence\r\nof the strange sight which no one in the world has yet seen, at least\r\nwith a vision capable of observing. In spite of the lateness of the\r\nhour, which upsets all our habits, our attention is concentrated and no\r\nessential thing escapes us.\r\n\r\nAt last, about ten o’clock, something happens. The male has hit upon a\r\npotsherd whose shelter seems to suit him. He releases his companion\r\nwith one hand, with one alone, and continuing to hold her with the\r\nother, he scratches with his legs and sweeps with his tail. A grotto\r\nopens. He enters and, slowly, without violence, drags the patient\r\nScorpioness after him. Soon both have disappeared. A plug of sand\r\ncloses the dwelling. The couple are at home.\r\n\r\nTo disturb them would be a blunder: I should be interfering too soon,\r\nat an inopportune moment, if I tried at once to see what was happening\r\nbelow. The preliminary stages may last for the best part of the night;\r\nand it does not do for me, who have turned eighty, to sit up so late. I\r\nfeel my legs giving way; and my eyes seem full of sand.\r\n\r\nAll night long I dream of Scorpions. They crawl under my bed-clothes,\r\nthey pass over my face; and I am not particularly excited, so many\r\ncurious things do I see in my imagination. The next morning, at\r\ndaybreak, I lift the stoneware. The female is alone. Of the male there\r\nis no trace, either in the home or in the neighbourhood. First\r\ndisappointment, to be followed by many others.\r\n\r\n10th May.—It is nearly seven o’clock in the evening; the sky is\r\novercast with signs of an approaching shower. Under one of the\r\npotsherds is a motionless couple, face to face, with linked fingers.\r\nCautiously I raise the potsherd and leave the occupants uncovered, so\r\nas to study the consequences of the interview at my ease. The darkness\r\nof the night falls and nothing, it seems to me, will disturb the calm\r\nof the home deprived of its roof. A sharp shower compels me to retire.\r\nThey, under the lid of the cage, have no need to take shelter against\r\nthe rain. What will they do, left to their business as they are but\r\ndeprived of a canopy to their alcove?\r\n\r\nAn hour later, the rain ceases and I return to my Scorpions. They are\r\ngone. They have taken up their abode under a neighbouring tile. Still\r\nwith their fingers linked, the female is outside and the male indoors,\r\npreparing the home. At intervals of ten minutes, the members of my\r\nfamily relieve one another, so as not to lose the exact moment of the\r\npairing, which appears to be imminent. Wasted pains: at eight o’clock,\r\nit being now quite dark, the couple, dissatisfied with the spot, set\r\nout on a fresh ramble, hand in hand, and go prospecting elsewhere. The\r\nmale, walking backwards, leads the way, chooses the dwelling as he\r\npleases; the female follows with docility. It is an exact repetition of\r\nwhat I saw on the 25th of April.\r\n\r\nAt last a tile is found to suit them. The male goes in first but this\r\ntime neither hand releases his companion for a moment. The nuptial\r\nchamber is prepared with a few sweeps of the tail. Gently drawn towards\r\nhim, the Scorpioness enters in the wake of her guide.\r\n\r\nI visit them a couple of hours later, thinking that I’ve given them\r\ntime enough to finish their preparations. I lift the potsherd. They are\r\nthere in the same posture, face to face and hand in hand. I shall see\r\nno more to-day.\r\n\r\nThe next day, nothing new either. Each sits confronting the other,\r\nmeditatively. Without stirring a limb, the gossips, holding each other\r\nby the finger-tips, continue their endless interview under the tile. In\r\nthe evening, at sunset, after sitting linked together for\r\nfour-and-twenty hours, the couple separate. He goes away from the tile,\r\nshe remains; and matters have not advanced by an inch.\r\n\r\nThis observation gives us two facts to remember. After the stroll to\r\ncelebrate the betrothal, the couple need the mystery and quiet of a\r\nshelter. Never would the nuptials be consummated in the open air, amid\r\nthe bustling crowd, in sight of all. Remove the roof of the house, by\r\nnight or day, with all possible discretion; and the husband and wife,\r\nwho seem absorbed in meditation, march off in search of another spot.\r\nAlso, the sojourn under the cover of a stone is a long one: we have\r\njust seen it spun out to twenty-four hours and even then without a\r\ndecisive result.\r\n\r\n12th May.—What will this evening’s sitting teach us? The weather is\r\ncalm and hot, favourable to nocturnal pastimes. A couple has been\r\nformed: how things began I do not know. This time the male is greatly\r\ninferior to his corpulent mate. Nevertheless, the skinny wight performs\r\nhis duty gallantly. Walking backwards, according to rule, with his tail\r\nrolled trumpetwise, he marches the fat Scorpioness around the glass\r\nramparts. After one circuit follows another, sometimes in the same,\r\nsometimes in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nPauses are frequent. Then the foreheads touch, bend a little to left\r\nand right, as if the two were whispering in each other’s ears. The\r\nlittle fore-legs flutter in feverish caresses. What are they saying to\r\neach other? How shall we translate their silent epithalamium into\r\nwords?\r\n\r\nThe whole household turns out to see this curious team, which our\r\npresence in no way disturbs. The pair are pronounced to be “pretty”;\r\nand the expression is not exaggerated. Semitranslucent and shining in\r\nthe light of the lantern, they seem carved out of a block of amber.\r\nTheir arms outstretched, their tails rolled into graceful spirals, they\r\nwander on with a slow movement and with measured tread.\r\n\r\nNothing puts them out. Should some vagabond, taking the evening air and\r\nkeeping to the wall like themselves, meet them on their way, he stands\r\naside—for he understands these delicate matters—and leaves them a free\r\npassage. Lastly, the shelter of a tile receives the strolling pair, the\r\nmale entering first and backwards: that goes without saying. It is nine\r\no’clock.\r\n\r\nThe idyll of the evening is followed, during the night, by a hideous\r\ntragedy. Next morning, we find the Scorpioness under the potsherd of\r\nthe previous day. The little male is by her side, but slain, and more\r\nor less devoured. He lacks the head, a claw, a pair of legs. I place\r\nthe corpse in the open, on the threshold of the home. All day long, the\r\nrecluse does not touch it. When night returns, she goes out and,\r\nmeeting the deceased on her passage, carries him off to a distance to\r\ngive him a decent funeral, that is to finish eating him.\r\n\r\nThis act of cannibalism agrees with what the open-air colony showed me\r\nlast year. From time to time, I would find, under the stones, a\r\npot-bellied female making a comfortable ritual meal off her companion\r\nof the night. I suspected that the male, if he did not break loose in\r\ntime, once his functions were fulfilled, was devoured, wholly or\r\npartly, according to the matron’s appetite. I now have the certain\r\nproof before my eyes. Yesterday, I saw the couple enter their home\r\nafter their usual preliminary, the stroll; and, this morning, under the\r\nsame tile, at the moment of my visit, the bride is consuming her mate.\r\n\r\nWell, one supposes that the poor wretch has attained his ends. Were he\r\nstill necessary to the race, he would not be eaten yet. The couple\r\nbefore us have therefore been quick about the business, whereas, I see\r\nthat others fail to finish after provocations and contemplations\r\nexceeding in duration the time which it takes the hour-hand to go twice\r\naround the clock. Circumstances impossible to state with precision—the\r\ncondition of the atmosphere perhaps, the electric tension, the\r\ntemperature, the individual ardour of the couple—to a large extent\r\naccelerate or delay the finale of the pairing; and this constitutes a\r\nserious difficulty for the observer anxious to seize the exact moment\r\nwhereat the as yet uncertain function of the combs might be revealed.\r\n\r\n14th May.—It is certainly not hunger that stirs up my animals night\r\nafter night. The quest of food has nothing to say to their evening\r\nrounds. I have served to the busy crowd a varied bill of fare, selected\r\nfrom that which they appear to like best. It includes tender morsels in\r\nthe shape of young Locusts; small Grasshoppers, fleshier than the\r\nAcridians; Moths minus their wings. At a later season, I add\r\nDragon-flies, a highly-appreciated dish, as is proved by their\r\nequivalent, the full-grown Ant-lion, of whom I used to find the\r\nremnants, the wings, in the Scorpion’s cave.\r\n\r\nThis luxurious game leaves them indifferent; they pay no attention to\r\nit. Amid the hubbub, the Locusts hop, the Moths beat the ground with\r\nthe stumps of their wings, the Dragon-flies quiver; and the Scorpions\r\npass. They tread them underfoot, they topple them over, they push them\r\naside with a stroke of the tail; in short, they absolutely refuse to\r\nlook at them. They have other business in hand.\r\n\r\nAlmost all of them skirt the glass wall. Some of them obstinately\r\nattempt to scale it: they hoist themselves on their tails, fall down,\r\ntry again elsewhere. With their outstretched fists they knock against\r\nthe pane; they want to get away at all costs. And yet the grounds are\r\nlarge enough, there is room for all; the walks lend themselves to long\r\nstrolls. No matter: they want to roam afar. If they were free, they\r\nwould disperse in every direction. Last year, at the same time, the\r\ncolonists of the enclosure left the village and I never saw them again.\r\n\r\nThe spring pairing-season forces them to set forth exploring. The shy\r\nhermits of yesterday now leave their cells and go on love’s pilgrimage;\r\nheedless of food, they go in quest of their kind. Among the stones of\r\ntheir domain there must be choice spots at which meetings take place,\r\nat which assemblies are held. If I were not afraid of breaking my legs,\r\nat night, over the rocky obstacles of their hills, I should love to\r\nassist at their matrimonial festivals, amid the delights of liberty.\r\nWhat do they do up there, on their bare slopes? Much the same,\r\napparently, as in the glass enclosure. Having picked a bride, they take\r\nher about, for a long stretch of time, hand in hand, through the tufts\r\nof lavender. If they miss the attractions of my lantern, they have the\r\nmoon, that incomparable lamp, to light them.\r\n\r\n20th May.—The sight of the first invitation to a stroll is not an event\r\nupon which we can count every evening. Several emerge from under their\r\nstones already linked in couples. In this concatenation of clasped\r\nfingers, they have passed the whole day, motionless, face to face,\r\nmeditating. When night comes, without separating for a moment, they\r\nresume the walk around the glass begun on the evening before, or even\r\nearlier. No one knows when or how the junction was effected. Others\r\nmeet unexpectedly in sequestered passages, difficult of inspection. By\r\nthe time that I see them, it is too late: the team is on the way.\r\n\r\nTo-day, chance favours me. The acquaintance is made before my eyes, in\r\nthe full light of the lantern. A frisky, sprightly male, in his hurried\r\nrush through the crowd, suddenly finds himself confronting a fair\r\npasser-by who takes his fancy. She does not gainsay him; and things\r\nmove quickly.\r\n\r\nThe foreheads touch, the claws engage; the tails swing with a spacious\r\ngesture: they stand up vertically, hook together at the tips and softly\r\nstroke each other with a slow caress. The two animals stand on their\r\nheads in the manner already described. Soon, the raised bodies sink to\r\nthe ground; fingers are clasped and the couple start on their stroll\r\nwithout more ado. The pyramidal pose, therefore, is really the prelude\r\nto the harnessing. The pose, it is true, is not rare between two\r\nindividuals of the same sex on the meeting; but it is then less correct\r\nand above all, less marked by ceremony. At such times, we find\r\nmovements of impatience, instead of friendly excitations; the tails\r\nstrike in lieu of fondling each other.\r\n\r\nLet us watch the male, who hurries away backwards, very proud of his\r\nconquest. Other females are met, who stand around and look on\r\ninquisitively, perhaps enviously. One of them flings herself upon the\r\nravished bride, clasps her with her legs and makes an effort to stop\r\nthe team. The male exhausts himself in attempts to overcome this\r\nresistance; in vain he shakes, in vain he pulls: things won’t move.\r\nUndistressed by the accident, he throws up the game. A neighbour is\r\nthere, close by. Cutting parley short, this time without any further\r\ndeclaration, he takes her hands and invites her to a stroll. She\r\nprotests, releases herself and runs away.\r\n\r\nFrom among the group of onlookers, a second is solicited, in the same\r\nfree and easy manner. She accepts, but there is nothing to tell us that\r\nshe will not escape from her seducer on the way. But what does the\r\ncoxcomb care? There are more where she came from! And what does he\r\nwant, when all is said? The first that comes along!\r\n\r\nThis first-comer he soon finds, for here he is, leading his conquest by\r\nthe hand. He passes into the belt of light. Exerting all his strength,\r\nhe tugs and jerks at the other if she refuses to come, but is gentle in\r\nhis manner when he obtains a docile obedience. Pauses, sometimes rather\r\nprolonged, are frequent.\r\n\r\nThen the male indulges in some curious exercises. Bringing his claws,\r\nor let us say, his arms towards him and then stretching them out again,\r\nhe compels the female to make a like alternation of movements. The two\r\nof them form a system of jointed rods, like a lazy-tongs, opening and\r\nclosing their quadrilateral by turns. After this gymnastic exercise,\r\nthe mechanism contracts and remains stationary.\r\n\r\nThe foreheads now touch; the two mouths come together with tender\r\neffusions. The word “kisses” comes to one’s mind to express these\r\ncaresses. It is not applicable; for head, face, lips, cheeks, all are\r\nmissing. The animal, lopped off short, as though with the shears, has\r\nnot even a muzzle. Where we look for a face we are confronted with a\r\ndead wall of hideous jaws.\r\n\r\nAnd to the Scorpion this represents the supremely beautiful! With his\r\nfore-legs, more delicate, more agile than the others, he pats the\r\nhorrible mask, which in his eyes is an exquisite little face;\r\nvoluptuously he nibbles and tickles with his jaws the equally hideous\r\nmouth opposite. It is all superb in its tenderness and simplicity. The\r\nDove is said to have invented the kiss. But I know that he had a\r\nfore-runner in the Scorpion.\r\n\r\nDulcinea lets her admirer have his way and remains passive, not without\r\na secret longing to slip off. But how is she to set about it? It is\r\nquite easy. The Scorpioness makes a cudgel of her tail and brings it\r\ndown with a bang upon the wrists of her too-ardent wooer, who there and\r\nthen lets go. The match is broken off, for the time being. To-morrow,\r\nthe sulking-fit will be over and things will resume their course.\r\n\r\n25th May.—This blow of the cudgel teaches us that the docile companion\r\nrevealed by our first observations is capable of whims, of obstinate\r\nrefusals, of sudden divorces. Let us give an example.\r\n\r\nThis evening, he and she, a seemly couple, are out for a stroll. A tile\r\nis found and appears to suit. Letting go with one claw, so as to have\r\nsome freedom of action, the male works with his legs and tail to clear\r\nthe entrance. He goes in. By degrees, as the dwelling is dug out, the\r\nfemale follows him, meekly and gently, so one would think.\r\n\r\nSoon, the place and time perhaps not suiting her, she reappears and\r\nhalf-emerges, backwards. She struggles against her abductor, who, on\r\nhis side, pulls her to him, without, as yet, showing himself. A lively\r\ncontest ensues, one making every effort outside the cabin, the other\r\ninside. They go backwards and forwards by turns; and success is\r\nundecided. At last, with a sudden effort, the Scorpioness drags her\r\ncompanion out.\r\n\r\nThe unbroken team is in the open; the walk is resumed. For a good hour,\r\nthey hug the panes, tacking down one side of the cage and back by the\r\nother and then return to the tile recently deserted, the exact same\r\none. As the way is already open, the male enters without delay and\r\npulls like mad. Outside, the Scorpioness resists. Stiffening her legs,\r\nwhich plough the soil, and buttressing her tail against the arch of the\r\ntile, she refuses to go in. I like this resistance. What would the\r\npairing be without the playful setting of the preliminaries?\r\n\r\nUnder the stone, however, the ravisher insists and contrives to such\r\ngood purpose that the rebel obeys. She enters. It has just struck ten.\r\nIf I have to sit up for the rest of the night, I will wait for the\r\nresult; I shall turn over the potsherd at the fitting moment to catch a\r\nglimpse of what is happening underneath. Good opportunities are rare:\r\nlet us make the most of this one. What shall I see?\r\n\r\nNothing at all. In half an hour or less, the recalcitrant female frees\r\nherself, comes out of the shelter and flees. The other at once hurries\r\nup from the back of the cabin, stops on the threshold and looks out.\r\nThe beauty has escaped him. Sheepishly he returns indoors. He has been\r\ncheated. So have I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE LANGUEDOCIAN SCORPION: THE PAIRING\r\n\r\n\r\nJune sets in. For fear of a disturbance caused by too brilliant an\r\nillumination, I have hitherto kept the lantern hung outside, at some\r\ndistance from the pane. The insufficient light does not allow me to\r\nobserve certain details of the manner in which the couple are linked\r\nwhen strolling. Do they both play an active part in the scheme of the\r\nclasped hands? Are their fingers mutually interlinked? Or is only one\r\nof the pair active; and, if so, which? Let us ascertain exactly; the\r\nthing is not without importance.\r\n\r\nI place the lantern inside, in the centre of the cage. There is good\r\nlight everywhere. Far from being scared, the Scorpions are gayer than\r\never. They come hurrying round the beacon; some even try to climb up,\r\nso as to be nearer the flame. They succeed in doing so by means of the\r\nframework containing the glass panes. They hang on to the edges of the\r\ntin strips and stubbornly, heedless of slipping, end by reaching the\r\ntop. There, motionless, lying partly on the glass, partly on the\r\nsupport of the metal casing, they gaze the whole evening long,\r\nfascinated by the burning wick. They remind me of the Great Peacock\r\nMoths that used to hang in ecstasy under the reflector of my lamp. [43]\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the beacon, in the full light, a couple lose no time in\r\nstanding on their heads. The two fence prettily with their tails and\r\nthen go a strolling. The male alone acts. With the two fingers of each\r\nclaw, he has seized the two fingers of the corresponding claw of the\r\nScorpioness bundled together. He alone exerts himself and squeezes; he\r\nalone is at liberty to break the team when he likes: he has but to open\r\nhis pincers. The female cannot do this; she is a prisoner, handcuffed\r\nby her ravisher.\r\n\r\nIn rather infrequent cases, one may see even more remarkable things. I\r\nhave caught the Scorpion dragging his sweetheart along by the two\r\nfore-arms; I have seen him pull her by one leg and the tail. She had\r\nresisted the advances of the outstretched hand; and the bully,\r\nforgetful of all reserve, had thrown her on her side and clawed hold of\r\nher at random. The thing is quite clear: we have to do with a regular\r\nrape, abduction with violence. Even so did Romulus’ youths rape the\r\nSabine women.\r\n\r\nThe brutal ravisher is singularly persistent in his feats of prowess,\r\nwhen we remember that things end tragically sooner or later. The ritual\r\ndemands that he shall be eaten after the wedding. What a strange world,\r\nin which the victim drags the sacrificer by main force to the altar!\r\n\r\nFrom one evening to the next, I become aware that the more corpulent\r\nfemales in my menagerie hardly ever take part in the sport of the\r\nlinked team; it is nearly always the young, slim-waisted ones to whom\r\nthe ardent strollers pay their addresses. They must have sprightly\r\nflappers. True, there are moments when they have interviews with the\r\nothers, accompanied by strokes of the tail and attempts at harnessing;\r\nbut these are brief displays, devoid of any great fervour. No sooner is\r\nshe seized by the fingers than the portly temptress, with a blow of her\r\ntail, rebukes the untimely familiarity. The rejected suitor retires\r\nfrom the contest without insisting further. They go their several ways.\r\n\r\nThe big-bellied ones are therefore elderly matrons, indifferent\r\nnowadays to the effusive manners of the pairing-season. This time last\r\nyear and perhaps even before, they had their own good spell; and that\r\nis enough for them henceforth. The female Scorpion’s period of\r\ngestation is consequently extraordinarily long, longer than will be\r\noften found even among animals of a higher order. It takes her a year\r\nor more to mature her germs.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the couple whom we have just seen forming up beneath\r\nthe lantern. I inspect them at six o’clock the next morning. They are\r\nunder the tile linked precisely as though for a stroll, that is to say,\r\nface to face and with clasped fingers. While I watch them, a second\r\npair forms and begins to wander to and fro. The early hour of the\r\nexpedition surprises me: I had never seen such an incident in broad\r\ndaylight and was seldom to see it again. As a rule it is at nightfall\r\nthat the Scorpions go strolling in couples. Whence this hurry to-day?\r\n\r\nI seem to catch a glimpse of the reason. It is stormy weather; in the\r\nafternoon, there is incessant, very mild thunder. St. Mèdard, whose\r\nfeast fell yesterday, is opening his flood-gates wide; it pours all\r\nnight. The great electric tension and the smell of ozone have stirred\r\nup the sleepy hermits, who, nervously irritated, for the most part come\r\nto the threshold of their cells, stretching their questioning claws\r\noutside and enquiring into the condition of things. Two, more violently\r\nexcited than the others, have come out, influenced by the intoxication\r\nof the pairing which is enhanced by the intoxication of the storm; they\r\nsuited each other; and here they are solemnly marching to the sound of\r\nthe thunder-claps.\r\n\r\nThey pass before open huts and try to go in. The owner objects. He\r\nappears in the doorway, shaking his fists, and his action seems to say:\r\n\r\n“Go somewhere else; this place is taken.”\r\n\r\nThey go away. They meet with the same refusal at other doors, the same\r\nthreats from the occupant. At last, for want of anything better, they\r\nmake their way under the tile where the first couple have been lodging\r\nsince the day before.\r\n\r\nThe cohabitation entails no quarrelling; the first settlers and the\r\nnewcomers, side by side, keep very quiet, each couple absorbed in\r\nmeditation, completely motionless, with fingers still clasped. And this\r\ngoes on all day. At five o’clock in the evening, the couples separate.\r\nAnxious apparently to take part in the usual twilight rejoicings, the\r\nmales leave the shelter; the females, on the other hand, remain under\r\nthe tile. Nothing, so far as I know, has happened during the long\r\ninterview, nothing despite the stimulating effects of the thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nThis fourfold occupation of one dwelling is not an isolated instance:\r\ngroups, regardless of sex, are not infrequent under the potsherds in\r\nthe glass cage. I have already said that, in their original homes, I\r\nhave never found two Scorpions under one stone. We must not infer from\r\nthis that unsociable habits prohibit all intercourse among neighbours;\r\nwe should be making a mistake: the glazed enclosure tells us so. There\r\nare cabins in more than sufficient numbers; each Scorpion would be able\r\nto choose himself a dwelling and thenceforth to occupy it as the\r\njealous owner. Nothing of the kind takes place. Once the nocturnal\r\nexcitement sets in, there is no such thing as a home respected by\r\nothers. Everything is common property. Whoever wishes to slip under the\r\nfirst tile that offers does so without protest from the occupant. The\r\nScorpions go abroad, walk about and enter any house they may chance\r\nupon. In this way, when the twilight diversions are over, groups of\r\nthree, four, or sometimes more are formed without distinction of sex\r\nand, packed pretty closely in the narrow home, spend the rest of the\r\nnight and the whole of the following day together. For that matter,\r\ntheirs is only a temporary shanty, which is exchanged next evening for\r\nanother, according to the strollers’ fancy. And these roving gipsies\r\nlive quite peaceably. There is never any serious strife between them,\r\neven when they are five or six in the same messroom.\r\n\r\nNow this tolerance prevails only in the adults, due, no doubt, to some\r\ndegree, to the fear of reprisals. There is another and more imperative\r\nreason for peaceful relations: concord is a necessity in assemblies at\r\nwhich the future is being prepared. The Scorpions’ characters therefore\r\nbecome assuaged, but not entirely: there are always perverse appetites\r\namong the females who are about to enter upon the period of gestation.\r\n\r\nI have always present in my mind the memory of the following odious\r\nspectacles. A heedless male, who has attained hardly a third or a\r\nfourth of his final size, is passing, unthinking, of evil, before the\r\ndoor of a dwelling. The fat matron comes out, accosts the poor wretch,\r\npicks him up in her claws, kills him with her sting and then quietly\r\neats him.\r\n\r\nScorpion lads and lasses, the one sooner, the other later, perish in\r\nthe same manner in the glass cage. I scruple to replace the deceased:\r\nit would be providing fresh food for the slaughter. There were a dozen\r\nof them; and in a few days I have not one left. Without the excuse of\r\nhunger, for the regular victuals are plentiful, the females have\r\ndevoured them all. Youth is certainly a beautiful thing, but it has\r\nterrible drawbacks in the society of these ogresses.\r\n\r\nI would gladly ascribe these massacres to the peculiar cravings often\r\nprovoked by pregnancy. The future mother is suspicious and intolerant;\r\nto her everything is an enemy, to be got rid of by eating it, when\r\nstrength permits. And indeed, when the quickly emancipated family is\r\nborn, in the middle of August, a profound peace reigns in the\r\nmenagerie. My vigilance is unable to surprise a single case of these\r\noutbreaks of cannibalism which used to occur so often.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the males, indifferent to the safety of the family,\r\nknow nothing of these tragic frenzies. They are peaceful creatures,\r\nblunt in their manners, but in any event incapable of ripping up their\r\nfellows. We never see two rivals disputing in mortal combat, for the\r\npossession of the coveted bride. Things happen, if not mildly, at least\r\nwithout blows of the dagger.\r\n\r\nTwo suitors come upon the same Scorpioness. Which of the two will\r\npropose to her and take her for a walk? The point will be decided by\r\nstrength of wrist.\r\n\r\nEach takes the beauty by the hand nearest to him with the fingers of\r\none claw. One standing on the right, the other on the left, they pull\r\nwith all their might in opposite directions. The legs, braced\r\nbackwards, exert a powerful leverage; the flanks quiver; the tails sway\r\nto and fro and suddenly dart forward. Now for it! They tug at the\r\nScorpioness by fits and starts with sudden backward runs; it is as\r\nthough they meant to pull her in two and each to carry off a piece. A\r\ndeclaration of love implies a threat to rend her asunder.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is no direct exchange of fisticuffs between\r\nthem, not even a back-hander with the tail. Only the victim is\r\nill-treated and roughly at that. To see these lunatics struggling, you\r\nwould think that their arms would be torn out. Nevertheless, there are\r\nno dislocations.\r\n\r\nWeary of an ineffectual contest, the two competitors at last take each\r\nother by the hands that remain at liberty: they form a chain of three\r\nand resume the process of jerking and tugging more violently than ever.\r\nEach of them bustles to and fro, advances, recoils and pulls his\r\nhardest till he is exhausted. Suddenly, the more fatigued of the two\r\nthrows up the sponge and runs away, leaving his adversary in possession\r\nof the object of their passions so vehemently disputed. Then, with his\r\nfree claw, the victor completes the team and the stroll begins. As for\r\nthe vanquished, we will not trouble about him: he will soon have found\r\nsomething in the crowd to make amends for his confusion.\r\n\r\nI will give you another instance of these meek encounters between\r\nrivals. A couple are walking along. The male is of medium size, but\r\nnevertheless very eager at the game. When his companion refuses to\r\nadvance, he pulls at her with jerks which send shudders along his\r\nspine. A second male, larger than the first, appears upon the scene.\r\nThe lady takes his fancy; he desires her. Will he abuse his strength,\r\nfling himself on the little chap, beat him, perhaps stab him? By no\r\nmeans. Among Scorpions these delicate matters are not decided by force\r\nof arms.\r\n\r\nThe burly fellow leaves the dwarf alone. He goes straight to the\r\ncoveted fair and seizes her by the tail. Then the two vie with each\r\nother in pulling, one in front, the other behind. A brief contest\r\nfollows, leaving each of them the master of a claw. With frantic\r\nviolence, one works on the right, the other on the left, as though they\r\nwished to pull the dame to pieces. At length the smaller realizes that\r\nhe is beaten; he lets go and makes off. The big one lays hold of the\r\nabandoned prey; and the team takes the road without further incident.\r\n\r\nThus, evening after evening, for four months, from the end of April to\r\nthe beginning of September, the preludes to the pairing are\r\nindefatigably repeated. The scorching dog-days do not calm these unruly\r\nlovers; on the contrary, they inflame them with new ardour. In the\r\nspring, I used to surprise the pilgrims’ tandems singly, at long\r\nintervals; in July I observe them by threes and fours at a time, on the\r\nsame evening.\r\n\r\nI take the opportunity, with not much success, to enquire what goes on\r\nunder the tiles where the strolling couples take refuge; my wish is to\r\nsee the details of the tender interview from start to finish. It does\r\nme no good to turn over the potsherd, even during the quiet hours of\r\nthe night. I have tried often and in vain. When deprived of their roof,\r\nthe linked couples resume their ramble and make for another shelter,\r\nwhere the impossibility of prolonged observation obtains once more.\r\nSpecial circumstances, independent of any intervention on our part, are\r\nneeded to make the delicate undertaking succeed.\r\n\r\nTo-day these circumstances are present. At seven o’clock in the\r\nmorning, on the 3rd of July, a couple attracts my attention, a couple\r\nwhom I saw forming, walking about and selecting a home on the previous\r\nevening. The male is under the tile, quite invisible save for the tips\r\nof his claws. The cabin was too small to shelter the two. He went in;\r\nshe, with her mighty paunch, remained outside, clutched by the fingers\r\nby her companion.\r\n\r\nThe tail, curved into a wide arc, is bent slackly to one side, with the\r\npoint of the sting resting on the ground. The eight legs, firmly\r\nplanted, are drawn backwards, marking a tendency to escape. The whole\r\nbody is completely motionless. I inspect the fat Scorpioness twenty\r\ntimes in the course of the day, without perceiving the least movement\r\nof the hinder part, the least change in the attitude, the least flexion\r\nin the curve of the tail. The animal could be no more lifeless if\r\nturned to stone.\r\n\r\nThe male, on his side, is no more active. Though I cannot see him, I at\r\nleast observe his fingers, which would tell me of any change of\r\nposture. And this petrified condition, which has lasted for the best\r\npart of the night, persists all day, until eight o’clock in the\r\nevening. What do they feel, facing each other thus? What are they\r\ndoing, motionless with clasped fingers? If the expression were\r\nallowable, I should say that they are meditating profoundly. It is the\r\nonly term that more or less represents what I see. But no human\r\nlanguage could have words fit to convey the bliss, the ecstasy of the\r\nScorpions thus coupled by the finger-tips. Let us remain silent upon\r\nthat which we cannot possibly understand.\r\n\r\nA little before eight o’clock, when the animation outside the house is\r\nalready approaching its height, the female suddenly moves; she\r\nstruggles and, with an effort, contrives to release herself. She flees,\r\nwith one of the pincers bent back towards her and the other stretched\r\nout. To break her seductive bonds, she pulled with such violence that\r\nshe put one of her shoulders out of joint. She flees, feeling her way\r\nwith the uninjured claw. The male runs off too. All is over for this\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nThese rambles in pairs, which are customary in the evening all through\r\nthe summer, are evidently the preliminaries to more serious affairs.\r\nThe strollers inspect each other, display their graces, show off their\r\nqualities before coming to conclusions. But when does the decisive\r\nmoment arrive? My patience is exhausted in waiting for it; I vainly\r\nprolong my vigils and turn over potsherd after potsherd, in my anxiety\r\nat last to know the exact part played by the combs; my hopes remain\r\nunfulfilled.\r\n\r\nIt is at a very late hour in the night that the marriage is\r\nconsummated: of that I have no doubt whatever. If I had any chance of\r\narriving at the right moment, I would struggle against sleep till break\r\nof day: my old eyelids are still capable of doing so when the\r\nacquisition of an idea is at stake. But how hazardous my perseverance\r\nwould be!\r\n\r\nI am very well aware, having seen it over and over again, that, in the\r\nvast majority of cases, we find the couple next morning, under the\r\ntile, harnessed together just as they were on the evening before. To\r\nsucceed, I should have to upset the habits of a lifetime and lie in\r\nwait every night for three or four months on end. The plan is beyond my\r\nstrength: and I give it up.\r\n\r\nOnce only did I obtain an inkling of the solution of the problem. At\r\nthe moment when I lift the stone, the male is turning over without\r\nreleasing the clasp of his hands; with his belly upturned, he slowly\r\nslides backwards under his mate. [44] Even so does the Cricket behave\r\nwhen his pleadings at last obtain a hearing. In this posture, the\r\ncouple would only have to steady themselves, probably with the teeth of\r\ntheir combs, to achieve their ends. But, startled by the violation of\r\ntheir home, the superimposed twain separate then and there. From the\r\nlittle that I have seen, it seems likely, therefore, that the Scorpions\r\nend their mating in an attitude similar to that of the Crickets. In\r\naddition they have their hands clasped and their combs interlocked.\r\n\r\nI am better informed of subsequent events within the cell. Let us mark\r\nthe tiles under which the couples take refuge in the evening, after\r\ntheir stroll. What do we find next morning? As a rule, precisely the\r\nsame linked couple as the day before, face to face, with fingers\r\nunited.\r\n\r\nSometimes the female is alone. The male, having finished his business,\r\nhas found means to release himself and go away. He had grave reasons\r\nfor cutting short the transports of the alcove. Especially in May, the\r\ntime of the most ardent enjoyment, I often indeed find the female\r\nnibbling and relishing her deceased mate.\r\n\r\nWho committed the murder? The Scorpioness, evidently. These are the\r\natrocious customs of the Praying Mantis: [45] the lover is stabbed and\r\nthen eaten, if he does not retire in time. By the exercise of\r\nnimbleness and decision, he can do so sometimes, not always. He is able\r\nto release his hands, for it is his that squeeze; by lifting his\r\nthumbs, he unclasps them. But there remains the diabolical little\r\nmechanism of the combs, an apparatus of sensual pleasure, now a trap.\r\nOn both sides the long teeth of this interlocking gear, closely fitting\r\nand perhaps spasmodically contracted, refuse to come apart as promptly\r\nas could be wished. The poor fellow is lost.\r\n\r\nHe has a poisoned dagger similar to that which threatens him: can he,\r\ndoes he know how to defend himself? It seems as though he cannot, for\r\nhe is always the victim. It is possible that his reversed posture\r\nhinders him in wielding his tail, which he must curve over his back if\r\nhe wishes to bring it into play. Perhaps also an insuperable instinct\r\nprevents him from putting the future mother to death. He allows himself\r\nto be pinked by the terrible bride; he perishes without defence.\r\n\r\nThe widow forthwith begins to eat him. It is a part of the ritual, as\r\nwith the Spiders, who, deprived of the Scorpion’s fatal engine, at\r\nleast leave the males time to escape if they are prompt enough in\r\nforming a decision.\r\n\r\nThe funeral repast, though frequent, is not indispensable; whether the\r\nmale is devoured depends a little on the condition of the female’s\r\nstomach. I have seen some who, despising the nuptial morsel, frugally\r\nswallowed the head of the deceased and then flung the corpse outside,\r\nwithout touching it again. I have seen these furies carry their dead\r\nhusband at arm’s length, dragging him about the whole morning, in sight\r\nof all, like a trophy, and then, without further ceremony, leaving him\r\nuntouched and abandoning him to those eager dissectors, the Ants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE LANGUEDOCIAN SCORPION: THE FAMILY\r\n\r\n\r\nBook-knowledge is a poor resource in the problems of life; assiduous\r\nstudy with the facts is preferable in this connection to the best\r\nstocked library. In many cases, ignorance is a good thing: the mind\r\nretains its freedom of investigation and does not stray along the roads\r\nleading nowhither, suggested by one’s reading. I have proved the truth\r\nof this once more.\r\n\r\nAn anatomical monograph had told me that the Languedocian Scorpion is\r\nbig with young in September. Although it was written by a master’s\r\nhand, how much better should I have done not to consult it! The family\r\nsees the light of day long before this season, at least in my climate;\r\nand, as the rearing lasts but a short time, I should have seen nothing\r\nhad I delayed until September. A third year of observation, tiresome to\r\nwait for, would have become necessary, in order at last to witness a\r\nsight which I foresaw to be of the highest interest. But for\r\nexceptional circumstances, I should have allowed the fleeting\r\nopportunity to pass, and should have lost a year and perhaps even\r\nabandoned the subject.\r\n\r\nYes, ignorance may have its advantages; the new is found far from the\r\nbeaten track. One of our most illustrious masters, little suspecting\r\nthe lesson he was giving me, taught me that some time ago. One fine\r\nday, Pasteur [46] rang unexpectedly at my front-door: the very same man\r\nwho was soon to acquire such world-wide celebrity. His name was\r\nfamiliar to me. I had read the scholar’s fine work on the dissymmetry\r\nof tartaric acid; I had followed with the greatest interest his\r\nresearches on the theory of spontaneous generation.\r\n\r\nEach period has its scientific crotchet: to-day, it is evolution; in\r\nthose days, it was spontaneous generation. With his glass bulbs made\r\nsterile or fertile at will, with his experiments which were magnificent\r\nin their severity and simplicity, Pasteur gave the death-blow to the\r\nlunacy which professed to see life springing from a chemical conflict\r\nin the seat of putrefaction.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the dispute, which was to be so triumphantly elucidated,\r\nwas at its height. I welcomed my distinguished visitor to the best of\r\nmy ability. The scientist had come to me before all others for certain\r\nparticulars. I owed this signal honour to my quality of fellow\r\nphysicist and chemist. Such a poor, obscure, fellow scientist!\r\n\r\nPasteur’s tour through the Avignon region had sericiculture for its\r\nobject. For some years, the Silk-worm-nurseries had been in confusion,\r\nravaged by unknown plagues. The worms, for no appreciable reason, were\r\nfalling into a putrid deliquescence, and then hardening, so to speak,\r\ninto plaster sugar-plums. The downcast peasant saw one of his chief\r\ncrops disappearing; after great trouble and expense, he had to fling\r\nhis nurseries on the dust-heap.\r\n\r\nA few words were exchanged on the prevailing blight; and then, without\r\nfurther preamble, my visitor said:\r\n\r\n“I should like to see some cocoons. I have never seen any; I know them\r\nonly by name. Could you get me some?”\r\n\r\n“Nothing easier. My landlord happens to sell cocoons; and he lives in\r\nthe next house. If you will wait a moment, I will bring you what you\r\nwant.”\r\n\r\nFour steps took me to my neighbour’s, where I crammed my pockets with\r\ncocoons. I came back and handed them to the savant. He took one; he\r\nturned and turned it between his fingers; he examined it curiously, as\r\none would a strange object from the other end of the world. He put it\r\nto his ear and shook it.\r\n\r\n“Why, it makes a noise!” he said, quite surprised. “There’s something\r\ninside!”\r\n\r\n“Of course there is.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“The chrysalis.”\r\n\r\n“How do you mean, the chrysalis?”\r\n\r\n“I mean the sort of mummy into which the caterpillar changes before\r\nbecoming a Moth.”\r\n\r\n“And has every cocoon one of those things inside it?”\r\n\r\n“Obviously. It is to protect the chrysalis that the caterpillar spins.”\r\n\r\n“Really!”\r\n\r\nAnd without more words, the cocoons passed into the pocket of the\r\nsavant, who was to instruct himself at his leisure touching that great\r\nnovelty, the chrysalis. I was struck by this magnificent assurance.\r\nPasteur had come to regenerate the Silkworm, while knowing nothing\r\nabout caterpillars, cocoons, chrysalids or metamorphoses. The ancient\r\ngymnasts came naked to the fight. The talented combatant of the plague\r\nof our Silk-worm-nurseries hastened to the battle likewise naked, that\r\nis to say, destitute of the simplest notions about the insect which he\r\nwas to deliver from danger. I was staggered; nay, more, I was\r\nthunderstruck.\r\n\r\nI was not so much amazed by what followed. Pasteur was occupied at the\r\ntime with another question, that of the improvement of wine by heating.\r\nSuddenly changing the conversation,\r\n\r\n“Show me your cellar,” he said.\r\n\r\nI! I show my cellar, my private cellar, poor I, lately, with my pitiful\r\nteacher’s salary, could not allow myself the luxury of a little wine\r\nand used to make a sort of small cider by setting a handful of brown\r\nsugar and some grated apples to ferment in a jar! My cellar! Show my\r\ncellar! Why not my barrels, my cobwebbed bottles, each labelled with\r\nits year and quality! My cellar!\r\n\r\nFull of confusion, I evaded the request and tried to change the\r\nsubject. But he persisted:\r\n\r\n“Show me your cellar, please.”\r\n\r\nThere was no resisting such firmness. I pointed with my finger to a\r\ncorner in the kitchen, where stood a chair with no seat to it and, on\r\nthat chair, a demijohn containing two or three gallons.\r\n\r\n“That’s my cellar, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Is that your cellar?”\r\n\r\n“I have no other.”\r\n\r\n“Is that all?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that’s all, I’m sorry to say.”\r\n\r\n“Really!”\r\n\r\nNot a word more; nothing further from the savant. Pasteur, it was\r\nevident, had never tasted the highly-spiced dish which the vulgar call\r\nla vache enragée. Though my cellar—the dilapidated chair and the more\r\nthan half-empty demijohn—had nothing to tell of the fermentation to be\r\nchecked by heat, it spoke eloquently of another thing which my\r\nillustrious visitor seemed not to understand. There was one microbe\r\nthat escaped his notice, and a very terrible microbe: that of\r\nill-fortune strangling good-will.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the unlucky introduction of the cellar, I am none the less\r\nstruck by his serene assurance. He knows nothing of the transformation\r\nof insects; he has just seen a cocoon for the first time and learnt\r\nthat there is something inside that cocoon, the rough draft of the moth\r\nthat will be; he is ignorant of what is known to the meanest schoolboy\r\nof our southern province; and this novice, whose artless questions\r\nsurprise me so greatly, is about to revolutionize the hygiene of the\r\nSilk-worm nurseries. In the same way, he will revolutionize medicine\r\nand general hygiene.\r\n\r\nHis weapon is theory, heedless of details, and taking a bird’s-eye view\r\nof the whole question. What cares he for metamorphoses, larvæ, nymphs,\r\ncocoons, pupæ, chrysalids and the thousand and one little secrets of\r\nentomology! For the purposes of his problem, perhaps, it is just as\r\nwell to be ignorant of all that. His theories will retain their\r\nindependence and their daring flight all the more easily; their\r\nmovements will be all the freer, when released from the leading-strings\r\nof the known.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by the magnificent example of the cocoons rattling in\r\nPasteur’s astonished ears, I have made it a rule to adopt the method of\r\nignorance in my investigations of the instincts. I read very little.\r\nInstead of turning the pages of books, an expensive proceeding quite\r\nbeyond my means, instead of consulting other people, I persist in\r\nobstinately interviewing my subject until I succeed in making him\r\nspeak. I know nothing. So much the better: my queries will be all the\r\nfreer, now in this direction, now in the opposite, according to the\r\nglimpses of light obtained. And if, by chance, I do open a book, I take\r\ncare to leave a compartment of my mind wide open to doubt; for the soil\r\nwhich I am clearing bristles with weeds and brambles.\r\n\r\nFor lack of taking this precaution, I very nearly wasted a year.\r\nRelying on what I had read, I did not look for the family of the\r\nLanguedocian Scorpion until September; and I obtained it quite\r\nunexpectedly in July. The difference between the real and the\r\nanticipated date I ascribe to the disparity of the climates: my\r\nobservations were all made in Provence and my informant, Léon Dufour,\r\n[47] made his in Spain. Notwithstanding the master’s high authority, I\r\nought to have been on my guard. I was not; and I should have lost the\r\nopportunity if, as luck would have it, the Common Black Scorpion had\r\nnot taught me. Ah, how right was Pasteur not to know the chrysalis!\r\n\r\nThe Common Scorpion, smaller and much less active than the other, was\r\nreared, for purposes of comparison, in some humble glass jam-pots\r\nstanding on the table in my study. These unassuming receptacles did not\r\ntake up much room and were easy to examine and I made a point of\r\nvisiting them daily. Every morning, before sitting down to blacken a\r\nfew pages of my diary with prose, I invariably lifted the piece of\r\ncardboard which I employed to shelter my boarders and enquired into the\r\nhappenings of the night. These daily inspections were not so feasible\r\nin the large glass cage, whose numerous dwellings would all be thrown\r\ninto confusion, if they were to be examined one by one and then\r\nmethodically set in order as discovered. With my pots of Black\r\nScorpions, the inspection was the matter of a moment.\r\n\r\nIt was well for me that I always had this auxiliary establishment\r\nbefore my eyes. On the 22nd of July, at six o’clock in the morning,\r\nraising the cardboard screen, I found a mother beneath it, with her\r\nlittle ones clustering on her back like a sort of white cloak. I\r\nexperienced one of those moments of sweet contentment which, at\r\nintervals, reward the long-suffering observer. For the first time I had\r\nbefore my eyes the fine spectacle of the Scorpioness clad in her young.\r\nThe delivery was quite recent: it must have taken place during the\r\nnight, for, on the previous evening, the mother was naked.\r\n\r\nFurther successes awaited me: on the next day, a second mother is\r\nwhitened with her brood: the day after that, two others at a time are\r\nin the same condition. That makes four. It is more than my ambition\r\nhoped for. With four families of Scorpions and a few quiet days before\r\nme, we may find some pleasure in life.\r\n\r\nAll the more so as fortune loads me with her favours. Ever since the\r\nfirst discovery in the jars, I have been thinking of the glass jars and\r\nasking myself whether the Languedocian Scorpion might not be as forward\r\nas her black sister. Let us make haste and see.\r\n\r\nI turn over the twenty-five tiles. A glorious success! I feel one of\r\nthose hot waves of enthusiasm with which I was familiar at the age of\r\ntwenty rush through my old veins. Under three out of the total number\r\nof tiles, I find a mother laden with her family. One has young that are\r\nalready quite of a fair size, about a week old, as my subsequent\r\nobservations informed me; the two others have borne their children\r\nrecently, during the recent night, as is proved by certain remnants\r\njealously guarded under the paunch. We shall see presently what these\r\nremnants represent.\r\n\r\nJuly runs to an end, August and September pass and nothing more occurs\r\nto swell my collection. The period of the family, therefore, for both\r\nScorpions is the second fortnight in July. From that time onwards\r\neverything is finished. And yet, among my guests in the black cage,\r\nthere are still some females as big and fat as those from whom I have\r\nobtained progeny. I reckoned on these too for an increase in the\r\npopulation; all the appearances authorized me to do so. Winter comes\r\nand none of them has answered my expectations. The business, which\r\nseemed close at hand, has been put off to next year: a fresh proof of\r\nlong gestation, very singular in the case of an animal of a lower\r\norder.\r\n\r\nI transfer each mother and her product, separately, into medium-sized\r\nreceptacles, which facilitate conscientious observation. At the early\r\nhour of my visit, those brought to bed during the night have still a\r\npart of the brood sheltered under their bellies. Pushing the mother\r\naside with a straw, I discover, amid the heap of young not yet hoisted\r\non the maternal back, objects that utterly upset all that the books\r\nhave taught me on this subject. The Scorpions, they say are viviparous.\r\nThe scientific expression lacks exactitude: the young do not first see\r\nthe light in the shape with which we are familiar.\r\n\r\nAnd this must be so. How would you have the outstretched claws, the\r\nsprawling legs, the curled-up tails make their way through the maternal\r\npassages? The cumberous little animal could never pass through the\r\nnarrow outlets. It must needs enter the world packed up and sparing of\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nThe remnants found under the mothers, in fact, show me eggs, real eggs,\r\nsimilar, or very nearly, to those which dissection extracts from the\r\novaries at an advanced stage of pregnancy. The little animal,\r\neconomically compressed to the dimensions of a grain of rice, has its\r\ntail laid along its belly, its claws flattened against its chest, its\r\nlegs pressed to its sides, so that the small easily gliding oval mass\r\npresents not the slightest protuberance. On the forehead, dots of an\r\nintense black mark the eyes. The tiny insect floats in a drop of\r\ntransparent moisture, which is for the moment its world, its\r\natmosphere, contained by a pellicle of exquisite delicacy.\r\n\r\nThese objects are really eggs. There were thirty or forty of them, at\r\nfirst, in the Languedocian Scorpion’s litter; not quite so many in the\r\nBlack Scorpion’s. Intervening too late in the nocturnal confinement, I\r\nam present at the finish. The little that remains, however, is\r\nsufficient to convince me. The Scorpion is in reality oviparous; only,\r\nher eggs hatch very speedily and the liberation of the young follows\r\nvery soon after the laying.\r\n\r\nNow how does this liberation take place? I enjoy the remarkable\r\nprivilege of witnessing it. I see the mother with the points of her\r\nmandibles delicately seizing, tearing, peeling off and lastly\r\nswallowing the membrane of the egg. She strips her new-born offspring\r\nwith the fastidious care and fondness of the Sheep and the Cat eating\r\nthe fœtal wrappers. Not a scratch on that scarce-formed flesh, not a\r\nlimb strained, in spite of the clumsiness of the tool employed.\r\n\r\nI cannot get over my surprise: the Scorpion has initiated the race into\r\nprocesses of maternity bordering on our own. In the distant days of the\r\ncarboniferous periods, when the first Scorpion appeared, the tender\r\ncases of child-birth were already preparing. The egg, the equivalent of\r\nthe long-sleeping seed, the egg, as already possessed by the reptile\r\nand the fish and later to be possessed by the bird and almost the whole\r\nbody of insects, was the contemporary of an infinitely more delicate\r\norganism which ushered in the viviparousness of the higher animals. The\r\nincubation of the germ did not take place outside, amidst the\r\nthreatening conflict of things; it was accomplished in the mother’s\r\nwomb.\r\n\r\nThe progressive movements of life know no gradual stages, from fair to\r\ngood, from good to excellent; they proceed by leaps and bounds, in some\r\ncases advancing, in some recoiling. The ocean has its rythmical ebb and\r\nflow. Life, that other ocean, more unfathomable than the watery ocean,\r\nhas its ebb and flow likewise. Will it have any other tides? Who can\r\nsay it will? Who can say that it will not?\r\n\r\nIf the Sheep did not assist by swallowing the membranous envelopes\r\nafter picking them up with her lips, never would the Lamb succeed in\r\nextricating itself from its swaddling-clothes. In the same way, the\r\nlittle Scorpion calls for its mother’s aid. I see some that, caught in\r\nstickiness, writhe aimlessly in the half-torn ovarian sac, unable to\r\nfree themselves. It wants a touch of the mother’s teeth to complete the\r\ndeliverance. It is doubtful even whether the young insect contributes\r\nto effect the laceration. Its weakness is of no avail against that\r\nother weakness, the natal envelope, though this be as slender as the\r\ninner lining of an onion-skin.\r\n\r\nThe young Chick has a temporary callosity at the end of its beak, which\r\nserves it as a pick-axe to break the shell. The young Scorpion,\r\ncondensed, to economise space, to the dimensions of a grain of rice,\r\nwaits inertly for help from without. The mother has to do everything.\r\nShe works with such a will that the accessories of childbirth disappear\r\naltogether, even the few sterile eggs being swept away with the others\r\nin the general flow. Not a remnant of the now useless tatters;\r\neverything has returned to the mother’s stomach; and the spot of ground\r\nthat received the litter is swept absolutely clear.\r\n\r\nSo here we have the young scrupulously cleaned and free. They are\r\nwhite. Their length from head to tail, measures nine millimetres [48]\r\nin the Languedocian Scorpion and four [49] in the Black. As the\r\nliberating toilet is completed, they climb, first one and then the\r\nother, on the mother’s back, hoisting themselves, without excessive\r\nhaste, along the claws, which the Scorpion holds flat on the ground, in\r\norder to facilitate the ascent. Close packed one against the other,\r\nentangled at random, they form a continuous sheet upon her back. With\r\nthe aid of their little claws, they settle themselves pretty firmly. I\r\nfind some difficulty in sweeping them away with the point of a\r\ncamel-hair pencil without more or less hurting the feeble creatures. At\r\nthis stage neither steed nor burden budges: it is the fit moment for\r\nexperiment. Clad in her offspring assembled to form a mantle of white\r\nmuslin, the Scorpion is a spectacle worthy of attention. She remains\r\nmotionless, with her tail curled on high. If I threaten the family too\r\nclosely with a straw, she at once lifts her two claws in an angry\r\nattitude, rarely adopted in her own defence. The two fists are raised\r\nas if for sparring, the nippers wide open, ready to thrust and parry.\r\nThe tail is seldom brandished: to loosen it suddenly would give a shock\r\nto the spine and perhaps make a part of the load fall to the ground.\r\nThe bold, sudden, imposing menace of the fists suffices.\r\n\r\nMy curiosity takes no notice of it. I push off one of the little ones\r\nand place it facing its mother, a finger’s breadth distant. The mother\r\ndoes not seem to trouble about the accident: motionless she was,\r\nmotionless she remains. Why perturb herself about a tumble? The fallen\r\nchild will be quite able to manage for itself. It gesticulates, it\r\nmoves about: and then, finding one of the mother’s claws within its\r\nreach, it clambers up nimbly enough and joins the crowd of its\r\nbrothers. It resumes its seat in the saddle, but is far from displaying\r\nthe agility of the Lycosa’s sons, who are expert riders, versed in the\r\nart of vaulting on horseback.\r\n\r\nThe experiment is repeated on a larger scale. This time, I sweep a part\r\nof the load to the ground; the little ones are scattered to no very\r\ngreat distance. There is a somewhat lengthy, hesitating pause. While\r\nthe brats wander about, without quite knowing where to go, the mother\r\nat last becomes at the state of affairs. With her two arms—I am\r\nspeaking of the pedipalpi that carry the pincers—with her two arms\r\njoined in a semicircle, she rakes and gathers the sand so as to bring\r\nthe truants towards her. This is done awkwardly, clumsily, with no\r\nprecautions against accidental crushing. The Hen, with a soft, clucking\r\ncall, makes the wandering Chicks return to the pale; the Scorpion\r\ncollects her family with the sweep of the rake. All are safe and sound\r\nnevertheless. As soon as they come in contact with the mother, they\r\nclimb up and form themselves again into the dorsal group.\r\n\r\nStrangers are admitted to this group as well as the legitimate\r\noffspring. If, with the camel-hair broom, I dislodge a matron’s family,\r\nwholly or in part, and place it within reach of a second mother, laden\r\nwith her own family, the latter will collect the young ones by armfuls,\r\nas she would her own offspring, and meekly allow the newcomers to mount\r\nupon her back. One would say that she adopts them, were the expression\r\nnot too ambitious. There is no adoption. We have once more the\r\nblindness of the Lycosa, who is incapable of distinguishing between her\r\nown and another’s progeny, and welcomes all that swarms about her legs.\r\n\r\nI expected to come upon excursions similar to those of the Lycosa, whom\r\nit is not unusual to meet scouring the heath with her pack of children\r\non her back. The Scorpion knows nothing of these diversions. Once she\r\nbecomes a mother, for sometime she does not leave her home, not even in\r\nthe evening, at the hour when others sally forth to frolic. Barricaded\r\nin her cell, not troubling to eat, she watches over the upbringing of\r\nher young.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, these frail creatures have a ticklish ordeal to\r\nundergo: they have, one might say, to be born a second time. They\r\nprepare for it by immobility and by an inward labour not unlike that\r\nwhich turns the larva into the perfect insect. In spite of their fairly\r\ncorrect appearance as Scorpions, the young ones have rather indistinct\r\nfeatures, which look as though seen through a mist. One is inclined to\r\ncredit them with a sort of child’s smock, which they must throw off in\r\norder to grow slender and acquire a definite outline.\r\n\r\nA week spent without moving, on the mother’s back, is required for this\r\nwork. Then there takes place an excoriation which I hesitate to\r\ndescribe by the expression moult, so greatly does it differ from the\r\ntrue moult, undergone later at repeated intervals. For the latter, the\r\nskin splits over the thorax; and the animal emerges through this single\r\nfissure, leaving a dry, cast-off garment behind it, similar in shape to\r\nthe Scorpion that has just discarded it. The empty mould retains the\r\nexact outline of the moulded animal.\r\n\r\nBut, this time, we have something different. I place a few young ones\r\nin the act of shedding their skin on a sheet of glass. They are\r\nmotionless, sorely tried, it seems, almost spent. The skin bursts,\r\nwithout special lines of cleavage; it tears at one and the same time in\r\nfront, behind, at the sides; the legs come out of their gaiters, the\r\nclaws leave their gauntlets, the tail quits its scabbard. The cast skin\r\nfalls in rags on all sides at once. It is a peeling without order and\r\nin tatters. When it is done, the stripped insects present the normal\r\nappearance of Scorpions. They have also acquired agility. Although\r\nstill pale in tint, they are nimble, quick to set foot to earth in\r\norder to run and play beside their mother. The most striking part of\r\nthis progress is the rapid growth. The young of the Languedocian\r\nScorpion measured nine millimetres in length; they now measure\r\nfourteen. [50] Those of the Black Scorpion have grown from four to six\r\nor seven millimetres. [51] The length increases by one half, which\r\nnearly trebles the volume.\r\n\r\nSurprised by this sudden growth, we wonder what the cause can be, for\r\nthe little ones have taken no food. Their weight has not increased; on\r\nthe contrary, it has diminished; for we must remember that the skin has\r\nbeen cast. The volume increases, but not the mass. There is, therefore,\r\na distension up to a certain point, which may be compared with that of\r\ninorganic bodies under the influence of heat. A secret change takes\r\nplace, which groups the living molecules into a more spacious\r\ncombination; and the volume increases without the addition of fresh\r\nmaterials. One who, possessed of a fine patience and suitably equipped,\r\ncared to follow the rapid changes of this architecture would, I think,\r\nreap a harvest of some value. I, in my penury, abandon the problem to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe remnants of the peeling process are white strips, satiny rags,\r\nwhich, so far from falling to the ground, adhere to the back of the\r\nmother Scorpion, especially near the base of the legs, where they\r\nbecome tangled into a soft carpet on which the lately-stripped insects\r\nrest. The mount now boasts a saddle-cloth well adapted to hold her\r\nrestless riders in their seats. Whether these have to alight or to\r\nremount, the layer of tatters, now become a solid harness, affords\r\nsupport for rapid movement.\r\n\r\nWhen I topple over the family with a slight stroke of the camel-hair\r\npencil, it is amusing to see how quickly the unhorsed ones resume their\r\nseat in the saddle. The fringes of the housings are grasped, the tail\r\nis used as a lever and, with a bound, the rider is in his place. This\r\ncurious carpet, a real boarding-net which makes climbing easy, lasts,\r\nwithout dislocations, for nearly a week, that is to say, until the\r\nemancipation. Then it falls off of its own accord, either as a whole or\r\npiecemeal, and nothing remains of it when the young are dispersed over\r\nthe surrounding country.\r\n\r\nMeantime, signs of the colouring appear; the tail and belly are tinged\r\nwith saffron, the claws assume the soft brilliancy of translucent\r\namber. Youth beautifies all things. The little Languedocian Scorpions\r\nare really magnificent. If they remained thus, if they did not carry a\r\npoison-still, soon to become threatening, they would be pretty\r\ncreatures which we should find a pleasure in rearing. Soon the wish for\r\nemancipation awakens in them. They gladly descend from the mother’s\r\nback to frolic merrily round about her. If they stray too far, the\r\nmother cautions them and brings them back again by sweeping the rake of\r\nher arms over the sand.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the siesta, the sight furnished by the Scorpioness is\r\nalmost as good as that of the Hen and her Chicks at rest. Most of the\r\nlittle ones are on the ground, pressed close against their mother: a\r\nfew are stationed on the white saddle-cloth, a delightful cushion.\r\nThere are some who clamber up the the mother’s tail, perch on the crest\r\nof the curve and seem to delight in looking down from this point of\r\nvantage upon the crowd. More acrobats arrive, who dislodge them and\r\ntake their places. All want their share in the curiosities provided by\r\nthe conning-tower.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the family is around the mother; there is a constant swarm\r\nof brats that crawl under the belly and there squat, leaving their\r\nforehead, with the gleaming black eye-points, outside. The more\r\nrestless prefer the mother’s legs, which to them represent a gymnasium;\r\nthey here swing as on a trapeze. Next, at their leisure, the whole\r\ntroop climb up to her back again, resume their places and settle down;\r\nand nothing more stirs, neither mother nor little ones.\r\n\r\nThis period, during which the Scorpion is matured and prepared for\r\nemancipation, lasts a week, exactly as long as the strange process that\r\ntrebles the volume without food. The family remains upon the mother’s\r\nback for a fortnight, all told. The Lycosa carries her young for six or\r\nseven months, during which time they are always active and lively,\r\nalthough unfed. What do those of the Scorpion eat, at least after the\r\nexcoriation that has given them agility and a new life? Does the mother\r\ninvite them to her meals and reserve the tenderest morsels of her\r\nrepasts for them? She invites nobody; she reserves nothing.\r\n\r\nI serve her a Locust, chosen among the small game that seems to me\r\nbest-suited to the delicate nature of her offspring. While she gnaws\r\nthe morsel, without troubling in the least about her surroundings, one\r\nof the little ones slips down her back, advances over her head and\r\nleans down to enquire what is happening. He touches her jaws with the\r\ntip of his leg; then briskly he decamps, startled. He makes off; and he\r\nis well-advised. The abyss engaged in the work of mastication, so far\r\nfrom reserving him a mouthful, might perhaps snap him up and swallow\r\nhim without giving him a further thought.\r\n\r\nA second is hanging on behind the Locust, the fore part of whose body\r\nthe mother is munching. He nibbles, he pulls, eager for a bit. His\r\nperseverance comes to nothing: the fare is too tough.\r\n\r\nIt is plain enough to see: the appetite is awakening; the young would\r\ngladly accept food, if the mother took the least care to offer them\r\nany, especially food adapted to the frailty of their tender stomachs:\r\nbut she just eats for herself and that is all.\r\n\r\nWhat do you want, O my pretty little Scorpions, who have provided me\r\nwith such delightful moments? You want to go away, to some distant\r\nplace, in search of victuals, of the tiniest of tiny beasties. I can\r\nsee it by your restless roving. You run away from your mother, who, on\r\nher side, ceases to know you. You are strong enough: the hour has come\r\nto disperse.\r\n\r\nIf I knew exactly what infinitesimal game is to your liking and if I\r\nhad sufficient time to procure it for you, I should love to continue\r\nyour upbringing, but not among the potsherds of your native cage, in\r\nthe company of your elders. I know their intolerant spirit. The ogres\r\nwould eat you up, my children. Your own mothers would not spare you.\r\nYou are strangers to them henceforth. Next year, at the wedding-season,\r\nthey would eat you, the jealous creatures! You had better go; prudence\r\ndemands it.\r\n\r\nWhere could I lodge you and how could I feed you? The best thing is to\r\nsay good-bye, not without a certain regret on my part. One of these\r\ndays, I will take you and scatter you in your own domain, the\r\nrock-strewn slope where the sun is so hot. There you will find brothers\r\nand sisters who, hardly larger than yourselves, are already leading\r\nsolitary lives under their little stones, sometimes no bigger than a\r\nthumb-nail. There you will learn the hard struggle for life better than\r\nyou would with me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME PLANT LICE\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE PENTATOMÆ AND THEIR EGGS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the forms which life is able to bestow on her creations, that of the\r\nbird’s egg is one of the simplest and loveliest. Nowhere do we find the\r\nbeauty of the circle and the ellipse, the geometrical bases of organic\r\nbodies, combined with greater precision. At one of the poles is the\r\nsphere, the perfect form, capable of enclosing the greatest volume in\r\nthe smallest envelope; at the other is the point of the ellipsoid,\r\nwhich tempers the monotonous austerities of the big end.\r\n\r\nThe colour-scheme, likewise very simple, adds its graces to those of\r\nform. Some eggs display the dull white of chalk, others the translucid\r\nwhite of polished ivory. The Wheat-ear’s are a delicate blue, like that\r\nof a sky freshly washed by a rain-storm; the Nightingale’s are a dark\r\ngreen, like that of a pickled olive; the eggs of certain Warblers are\r\ntinted with an exquisite carnation, like that of roses still in the\r\nbud.\r\n\r\nThe Yellow-hammer scrawls an indecipherable scribble on her eggs; that\r\nis to say, the shells display mottled markings, an artistic mixture of\r\nlines and blots. The Butcher-birds encircle the large end with a\r\nspeckled crown; the Blackbird and the Raven sprinkle brown splashes,\r\ninnocent of design, on a greenish-blue ground; the Curlew and the Gull\r\nemploy large spots like those on the Leopard’s coat; and so with the\r\nrest; each has its speciality, its trade-mark, always designed in sober\r\ncolours, the mere matching of which constitutes a merit.\r\n\r\nWith the exquisite simplicity of its geometry and its ornament, the\r\nbird’s egg enchants the least cultivated eye. In return for the little\r\nservices which they render me, I sometimes admit to my study certain\r\nsmall boys of the neighbourhood, zealous searchers all. Now what do\r\nthese simple-minded youngsters see in my work-room, of which they have\r\nheard all sorts of wonders? They see big, glass-fronted cupboards in\r\nwhich a thousand curious things are arranged, the cumbersome\r\naccumulations that gather about any one who investigates stones, plants\r\nand animals. Shells predominate.\r\n\r\nHuddling together in mutual encouragement, my shy visitors admire the\r\nmagnificent Sea-snails of every shape and colour; they point a finger\r\nat this or that shell which, by the lustre of its mother-of-pearl, its\r\nsize and its strange protuberances, is especially conspicuous in the\r\nmidst of all the rest. They gaze at my treasures and I watch their\r\nfaces. I read on them surprise, amazement and nothing more.\r\n\r\nThese things out of the sea, too complex in formation to impress a\r\nnovice, are mysterious objects that speak no known language. My little\r\ngiddy-pates are bewildered by these corkscrew stair-cases, these\r\nscrolls and spirals and conchs, whose geometry is beyond their\r\ncomprehension. They are left almost cold before this display of oceanic\r\nwealth. If I could get at what lies at the back of their minds, these\r\nchildren would say:\r\n\r\n“How funny!”\r\n\r\nThey would never say:\r\n\r\n“How pretty!”\r\n\r\nIt is quite another story with the boxes in which the birds’-eggs of\r\nthe district are arranged, clutch by clutch, lying on cotton-wool,\r\nprotected from the light. Now their cheeks flush with excitement and\r\nthey whisper, in one another’s ears, which they would choose of the\r\nfinest group in the box. There is no amazement now, but ingenuous\r\nadmiration. It is true that the egg recalls the nest and the young\r\nbirds, those incomparable joys of childhood. Nevertheless, a rush of\r\nreverent emotion evoked by the beautiful may be read on their faces.\r\nThe gems of the sea astound my little visitors; the simple beauty of\r\nthe eggs arouses a more human ecstasy.\r\n\r\nIn the very great majority of cases, the insect’s egg is far from\r\nattaining this consummate perfection, which impresses even the\r\nunaccustomed gaze. The usual shapes are the sphere, the spindle or\r\ncone, and the cylinder, with rounded ends, none of which is especially\r\ngraceful, owing to the absence of harmonious combinations of curves.\r\nMany of them are dingy in colour; some, by their excessive richness,\r\nform a violent contrast with the shortcomings of the germ inside. The\r\neggs of certain Moths and Butterflies are beads of bronze or nickel. In\r\nthese life seems to germinate within the rigid walls of a metal box.\r\n\r\nIf we employ the magnifying-glass, we find that ornamentation of detail\r\nis not unusual, but it is always complicated, without that nobler\r\nsimplicity which constitutes true beauty. The Clythræ [52] enclose\r\ntheir eggs in a shell whose substance is laminated in scales like those\r\nof a hop-cone, or twisted into intersecting diagonal fillets; certain\r\nLocusts engrave their spindles, scooping out spiral rows of little pits\r\nlike those of a thimble. There is, to be sure, no lack of prettiness in\r\nall this, but how far removed is such exuberance from the noble\r\nausterity of beauty!\r\n\r\nThe insect has ovarian æsthetics of its own, which have no relation to\r\nthose of the bird. I know of one case, however, in which comparison is\r\npossible. An insect of indifferent repute, a woodland Bug, the\r\nPentatoma of the naturalists, may offer its egg for comparison with the\r\nbird’s. This flat-bodied insect, emitting a horrible smell, lays\r\nmasterpieces of elegant simplicity, and, at the same time, of\r\nmechanical ingenuity; it disgusts us by its cosmetic, its hair-oil; but\r\nit interests us by its egg, which is worthy to rank beside that of the\r\nbird.\r\n\r\nI have just made a discovery on a sprig of asparagus. It is a cluster\r\nof eggs, about thirty in number, arranged in rows, in close contact,\r\nlike the beads on a piece of embroidery. I recognize the eggs of a\r\nwoodland Bug. The hatching took place some little time ago, for the\r\nfamily has not yet dispersed. The empty eggshells have remained in\r\nplace without any loss of shape, except that their lids are open.\r\n\r\nWhat a delightful collection of miniature vases in translucent\r\nalabaster, barely clouded with light grey! One would like to read a\r\nfairy-tale of the world of tiny things in which the fairies take tea\r\nout of such cups as these. The body of the vessel, a graceful oval cut\r\nsquare at the top, shows a delicate brown network of polygonal meshes.\r\nImagine the top of a bird’s egg neatly removed, making a dainty little\r\ngoblet of the remainder, and you have something very like the egg of\r\nthe Bug. In either case there are the same gentle curves.\r\n\r\nHere the resemblance ceases. It is in the upper part of the egg that\r\nthe insect displays its originality; its creation is a box with a lid.\r\nThis slightly convex cover is ornamented, like the body of the jar,\r\nwith a network of fine mesh; it is further embellished along the edge\r\nwith an opal border. At the hatching it swings open as on a hinge and\r\ncomes away all of a piece. Sometimes it falls off and leaves the jar\r\nwide open; sometimes it falls back into its normal position, once more\r\nclosing the jar, which looks as though it were still intact. Lastly,\r\nthe mouth is surrounded by very fine, thread-like attachments. These\r\nare, as it were, rivets to hold the lid in position, so as to close the\r\nvase hermetically.\r\n\r\nWe must not overlook one exceedingly characteristic detail. Quite close\r\nto the rim, inside the shell, there is always visible, after the\r\nhatching, a mark like a broad arrow, or a capital T, with the arms\r\ndeflected like those of an anchor. What is the meaning of this\r\ninfinitesimal detail? Is it a latch, a sort of lock with a bolt and\r\nhasp? Is it a potter’s mark, conferring a certificate of origin on the\r\nmasterpiece? What a strange effort of ceramic art merely to hold the\r\negg of a Bug!\r\n\r\nThe young ones have not yet left the battery of jars from which they\r\nrecently emerged. Gathered together in a heap, they are waiting for the\r\nbath of air and sunlight to harden them before dispersing and\r\nimplanting their suckers where they please. They are plump, thickset,\r\nblack, with the under surface of the belly red and the sides laced with\r\nthe same colour. How did they get out of their jars? By what artifice\r\ndid they raise the firmly-sealed lid? Let us try to find the answer to\r\nthis interesting question.\r\n\r\nIt is the end of April. In the enclosure, just outside my door, the\r\ncamphor-scented rosemaries are in full flower, bringing me visits from\r\na multitude of insects which I can consult at any time. Various species\r\nof Pentatomæ abound, but do not lend themselves to precise observation,\r\nby reason of their wandering life. If I want to know exactly which egg\r\nbelongs to which species or, above all, if I want to learn how the\r\nhatching is accomplished, it will not be enough to rely upon chance\r\ninspections of the flowering shrubs. It will be better to resort to\r\nrearing the insects under a wire-gauze cover.\r\n\r\nMy captives, isolated according to species and represented each by a\r\ncertain number of couples, give me hardly any trouble. All they need is\r\na cheerful sun and a bunch of rosemary daily renewed. I add to the\r\nfurnishing of the cage a few leafy twigs from various bushes. The\r\ninsect will choose whichever suits her as the spot for laying her eggs.\r\n\r\nBy the first fortnight in May the imprisoned Bugs have provided me with\r\neggs in excess of my hopes, eggs at once collected, together with their\r\nsupport, species by species, and placed in small glass tubes, where,\r\nunless I fail in vigilance, I shall easily be able to follow the\r\ndelicate hatching-process.\r\n\r\nIt is really a beautiful, a most delightful collection, and would be\r\nquite worthy to figure beside the eggs of the bird, if larger\r\ndimensions came to the assistance of our feeble sight. From the moment\r\nwe have to resort to the microscope, we allow the splendid to escape\r\nus. Let us magnify the Bug’s egg under the lens and it will amaze us as\r\nsurely as the Stonechat’s sky-blue egg, and perhaps even more. What a\r\npity that such beauty escapes our admiration by its minuteness!\r\n\r\nThe shape is never a complete ovoid: that is the bird’s perquisite. The\r\nupper end of the Pentatoma’s egg is always finished off with a sudden\r\ntruncation, into which a slightly convex lid is fitted, and we have\r\nbefore us a tiny ciborium, a delicious casket, an antique urn, a\r\ncylindrical cask with rounded ends, a full-bodied vase of Oriental\r\nporcelain, with ornaments consisting of bands, rosettes or traceries,\r\nvarying according to the mother’s individual taste. Always, moreover,\r\nwhen the egg is empty, we find a most delicate fringe of herring-boned\r\nthreads running round the mouth. These are the rivets to fasten the\r\nlid, which are pushed up and back at the moment when the new-born\r\ninsect is released.\r\n\r\nLastly, in all these egg-shells, after the hatching, we find inside\r\nthem, quite close to the rim, that black mark in the shape of a broad\r\narrow, of which we have already asked ourselves whether it is a\r\ntrade-mark or a sort of lock or bolt. The future will show us how far\r\nour guesses fall short of the reality.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are never sown at random. The whole batch is laid in a\r\nclose-packed group, in regular ranks of varying lengths, so that they\r\nmake a sort of mosaic of beads firmly fixed to their common support,\r\nusually a leaf. They adhere so firmly that we may brush the leaf with a\r\ncamel-hair pencil, or even touch them with the finger, without in any\r\nway disturbing their beautiful arrangement. After the young have gone\r\nwe find the open shells still in position, like so many little jam-pots\r\nstanding in rows on a market-woman’s barrow.\r\n\r\nLet me end by giving a few specific details. The eggs of the\r\nBlack-horned Pentatoma (P. nigricorne) are cylindroid in form, the base\r\nbeing a segment of a sphere. The lid, bearing a broad white band at the\r\nedge, frequently, but not always, has in the centre a transparent\r\nprotuberance, a sort of knob like that on the lid of a preserve-jar.\r\nIts entire surface is smooth and glossy, with no other ornament than\r\nits simplicity. The colour varies according to the degree of maturity.\r\nWhen recently laid the eggs are of a uniform straw-yellow: later, owing\r\nto the gradual organization of the germ, they turn a pale orange, with\r\na triangular bright-red patch in the centre of the lid. When empty they\r\nare a magnificent, pellucid opal-white, except the lid, which has\r\nbecome transparent as glass.\r\n\r\nOf the clutches of eggs obtained the most numerous was a patch of nine\r\nrows, each containing about a dozen eggs. The total was thus about a\r\nhundred. But usually the number of eggs is smaller than this, amounting\r\nto only half as many or less. Groups containing about a score of eggs\r\nare not uncommon. The enormous difference between these extremes\r\ntestifies to multiple layings at different spots, which, in view of the\r\ninsect’s rapid flight, may be at quite a distance from one another.\r\nThis detail will be of value when the time comes.\r\n\r\nThe Pale-Green Pentatoma (P. praesinum) moulds her eggs in little\r\nbarrels, ovoid at the bottom and adorned over their whole surface with\r\na network of fine polygonal meshes in relief. Their colour is a sooty\r\nbrown, and, after the hatching, a very light brown. The largest groups\r\nof eggs contain thirty or so. It is probably to this species that the\r\neggs belong which first attracted my attention on a sprig of asparagus.\r\n\r\nAs for the Berry Pentatoma (P. baccarum) here we again have barrels\r\nwith rounded ends, covered all over the surface with a tracery of\r\nmeshes. At first they are opaque and dark; then, being empty, they\r\nbecome translucent and white or pale-pink. Of these eggs I find groups\r\nof fifty and others of fifteen or even less.\r\n\r\nThat blessed plant of the kitchen-gardens, the cabbage, gives me the\r\nOrnate Pentatoma (P. ornatum), striped black and red. The eggs of this\r\nspecies are the prettiest of all in colouring. They are like little\r\ncasks with the two ends convex, especially the lower. The microscope\r\nshows us a surface engraved with pits, like those of a thimble,\r\narranged with exquisite regularity. At the top and bottom of the\r\ncylinder there is a broad dull-black band; on the sides is a wide white\r\nbelt with four large black spots symmetrically placed. The lid,\r\nsurrounded with snow-white filaments and edged with white, swells into\r\na black dome with a central white spot. In short, a funeral urn, with\r\nits violent contrast of coal-black and creamy white. The Etruscans\r\nwould have considered it a magnificent model for their burial vessels.\r\n\r\nThese eggs, with their funeral ornamentation, are arranged in small\r\ngroups, generally in two rows. There are hardly a dozen all told: a\r\nfresh proof that the eggs must be laid in a number of batches and at\r\ndifferent points; for the Cabbage Bug cannot limit herself to this\r\npaltry number when one of her relatives exceeds the hundred.\r\n\r\nMay is not over before the various batches of eggs collected and placed\r\nin tubes hatch out, first one and then another. Two or three weeks are\r\nenough to develop the germ. This is the time for constant vigilance, if\r\nI wish to understand the mechanism employed for the emergence and,\r\nabove all, the function of the strange tool, with the three black arms,\r\nwhich I find in every shell, at the edge of the opening, once the\r\nnew-born larva has departed.\r\n\r\nThose eggs which are translucent from the outset—for example, those of\r\nthe Black-horned Pentatoma—enable me, in the first place, to discover\r\nthat the implement of unknown use makes its appearance rather late,\r\nwhen the approaching deliverance is announced by a change in the colour\r\nof the lid. It is not, therefore, an original part of the egg, as this\r\ndescended from the ovaries; it is elaborated during the process of\r\ndevelopment, and even at a somewhat advanced phase, when the little Bug\r\nhas already been formed.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore cease to regard it, as I did at first, as a spring, a\r\nlock, some sort of a hinge to hold the lid in place. An actual device\r\nfor keeping the egg closed and protecting the germ would have to be in\r\nexistence when the egg was laid. And it is just at the end, when the\r\ntime has come to leave it, that the egg reveals this device. It is a\r\nquestion no longer of closing, but of opening. And, in this case, might\r\nnot the puzzling implement be a key, a lever to force open the lid,\r\nheld on by thread-like rivets, and perhaps also by the glue of an\r\nadhesive? Assiduous patience will tell us.\r\n\r\nHolding the magnifying-glass above my test-tubes, which I examine every\r\nmoment, at last I witness the hatching. The process is just beginning.\r\nThe lid is rising imperceptibly at one pole of its diameter; at the\r\nother it is tilting like a door on its hinges. The youngster has its\r\nback to the wall of the barrel, just below the edge of the lid, which\r\nis already gaping, a capital situation, enabling me to follow with some\r\nexactness the progress of the deliverance.\r\n\r\nThe little Bug, shrunken and motionless, has its head crowned with a\r\nskin cap, suspected rather than seen, so fine is it. Later, when it\r\nfalls off, this cap will be plainly visible. It serves as the base of a\r\ntrihedral angle. The three arms forming this angle are rigid and\r\nintensely black and look as if they ought to be of a horny nature. Two\r\nof them extend between the eyes, which are bright red; the third passes\r\ndown behind the head and is connected with the others, right and left,\r\nby a dark, very fine line. I might very well regard these dark lines as\r\ntense threads, ligaments which brace the three arms of the apparatus\r\nand prevent them from slipping farther apart, thereby blunting the\r\npoint of the angle, which is itself the key of the casket, that is, the\r\nrammer for pushing back the lid. This three-cornered mitre protects the\r\nhead, which is still soft and fleshy and incapable of forcing the\r\nobstruction: with its adamantine point truly applied right at the edge\r\nof the lid it has a firm grip of the disk which has to be unfastened.\r\n\r\nThis mechanism, this cap surmounted by an armoured point, must have its\r\nmotive force. Where is it? It is at the top of the head. Look\r\ncarefully, and there, involving a certain small area, almost a point,\r\nyou will see rapid pulsations, we might almost say piston-strokes,\r\nproduced, beyond a doubt, by sudden waves of blood. By hurriedly\r\ninjecting what little fluid its body contains under its pliant cranium,\r\nthe tiny creature turns its weakness into energy. The three-cornered\r\nhelmet rises, pushing upwards, always pressing its point firmly on the\r\nsame point of the lid. No blow is struck upon the tool; there is no\r\nintermittent percussion, but a continuous thrust.\r\n\r\nThe operation is so laborious that it lasts for more than an hour. By\r\nimperceptible degrees the lid is unfastened and rises obliquely, but as\r\na rule continues to adhere to the rim of the vase at the opposite pole\r\nof the diameter. At this pivotal point, where it would seem that there\r\nmust be a hinge, the lens reveals nothing peculiar. Here, as every\r\nelsewhere, there is a mere row of threads, drawn down to form rivets\r\nfor closing the cask. On the side opposite the point attacked, these\r\nrivets, less disturbed than the rest, do not quite give way, act as a\r\nhinge.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the tiny creature emerges from its shell. The legs and\r\nantennæ, economically folded over the thorax and abdomen, are\r\ncompletely motionless. Nothing moves, yet the Bug protrudes farther and\r\nfarther from its casket, doubtless with the aid of a process like that\r\nemployed by the larva of the Balaninus, [53] on leaving its nut. The\r\nflow of blood which causes the piston-strokes of the cranium distends\r\nalso that part of the body which is already free and converts it into a\r\nsupporting cushion; the hinder part, which is still imprisoned, is\r\ndiminished accordingly and in its turn enters the narrow opening. The\r\ninsect passes through a draw-plate, so gently and carefully that the\r\nmost I can detect is a tentative rocking to and fro at distant\r\nintervals as it drags itself from its socket.\r\n\r\nAt last the rivets are forced, the casket is open, and the lid, now on\r\na slant, is sufficiently raised. The three-cornered mitre has done its\r\nwork. What will become of it? Henceforth useless as a tool, it has to\r\ndisappear; and, as a matter of fact, I see it discarded. The filmy\r\nhead-dress which served as its foundation tears, becomes a tattered rag\r\nand very slowly slips over the Bug’s ventral surface, dragging with it\r\nthe hard little black contrivance, which still retains its shape.\r\nScarcely has this relic slipped midway down the belly when the tiny\r\ncreature, hitherto motionless in the attitude of a mummy, frees its\r\nlegs and antennæ from their economical position, stretches them out and\r\nimpatiently waves them to and fro. It is over: the insect leaves its\r\nsheath.\r\n\r\nThe instrument of release, still in the shape of a T with arms bent\r\nslightly downwards and sideways, remains sticking to the wall of the\r\nshell, near the opening. Long after the insect’s departure the lens\r\nfinds the ingenious triangle in its place. Its formation is the same in\r\nthe various Pentatomæ; but until we surprise the insect in the act of\r\nhatching its function is incomprehensible.\r\n\r\nA word more on the manner of opening the lidded casket. I have said\r\nthat the young Bug has its back to the wall of the little barrel, as\r\nfar as possible from the centre. It is here that it is born, dons its\r\ntiara and afterwards pushes with its head. Why does it not occupy the\r\ncentral region, a position which would seem to be prescribed by the\r\nshape of the egg and the more effectual protection of the grub’s early\r\nfrailty? Can there be any advantage in being born elsewhere, on the\r\nvery circumference?\r\n\r\nYes, there is, and a very distinct advantage, of a mechanical order.\r\nWith the top of its head, which throbs with the rushes of blood, the\r\nnew-born insect thrusts his pointed cap against the lid to be\r\nunfastened. What can be the cranial thrust of a drop of albumen but\r\nlately congealed into a living entity? He would be a bold man who\r\nshould venture to reply, so far is it beneath all evaluation. And this\r\nmere nothing has to push open the solid lid of the box.\r\n\r\nLet us picture the thrust applied to the centre. In that case the\r\neffort to dislodge the lid, the veriest trifle of an effort, would be\r\nuniformly distributed over the entire circumference, and all the rivets\r\nwhich fasten it would play their part in the resistance offered.\r\nSingly, the stitches would give way before the tiny force available;\r\nbut all together they are invincible. The method of the central thrust\r\nis therefore impracticable.\r\n\r\nIf we wished to loosen a nailed plank, it would be an illogical action\r\nto bang it in the middle. The whole of the nails would react in a\r\ncommon and insurmountable resistance. On the contrary, we attack it at\r\none end; we apply the leverage of our implement progressively to one\r\nnail after another. The little Bug in its casket does much the same: it\r\npushes out the extreme edge of the lid, so that, beginning at the point\r\nattacked, the rivets give way, one by one. The total resistance is\r\novercome because it is divided.\r\n\r\nWell done, little Bug! You have your own science of mechanics, based on\r\nthe same laws as ours; you know the secrets of the lever and the\r\nlifting-jack. To break its shell, the nascent bird grows a callosity on\r\nits beak, a pick-axe point whose function is to break down the chalky\r\nwall piecemeal. When the task is accomplished this callus, the tool of\r\na day, disappears. You have something better than the bird’s device.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour of your emergence comes, you don a cap in which three\r\nstiff ribs converge to a point. At the base of this appliance your soft\r\ncranium acts like the piston of an hydraulic press. Thus attacked, the\r\nroof of your hut is unfastened and thrown back. The bird’s callosity\r\ndisappears when the shell is in pieces; so does the mitre with which\r\nyou push out the head of your barrel. As soon as the lid opens wide\r\nenough to let you pass, you doff your cap with its tripod of rods.\r\n\r\nYour egg, however, is not broken; there is no violent demolition such\r\nas that practised by the bird. When empty, the egg-shell is not a ruin:\r\nit is still the graceful little egg that it was in the beginning,\r\nrendered yet more exquisite by its translucence, which enhances its\r\nbeauties. In what school, little Bug, did you learn the art of opening\r\nyour natal casket and the use of your little contrivance? There are\r\nthose who will say:\r\n\r\n“In the school of chance.”\r\n\r\nBut you, in all humility, cock your mitre and reply:\r\n\r\n“That’s not true.”\r\n\r\nThe Pentatoma is noted for another detail, which, if it were definitely\r\nproved, would surpass a hundredfold the marvels of the egg. I quote the\r\nfollowing passage from De Geer, [54] the Swedish Réaumur [55]:\r\n\r\n“The Bugs of this species (Pentatoma griseum) live on the birch-tree.\r\nIn the early part of July, I found several of them accompanied by their\r\nyoung. Each mother was surrounded by a troop of young ones, to the\r\nnumber of twenty, thirty and even forty. She always kept close beside\r\nthem, commonly on one of the catkins of the tree that contained her\r\neggs, and sometimes on a leaf. I have noted that these little Bugs and\r\ntheir mother do not always remain on the same spot, and that as soon as\r\nthe mother begins to move away all her little ones follow her, stopping\r\nwhenever the mother calls a halt. She thus leads them from catkin to\r\ncatkin or leaf to leaf and takes them wherever she pleases, as a Hen\r\ndoes her Chicks.\r\n\r\n“There are Bugs that do not leave their offspring; they even keep watch\r\nover them and take the greatest care of them while they are young. One\r\nday I happened to cut a young birch-branch peopled with such a family\r\nand I first observed the extremely uneasy mother, incessantly beating\r\nher wings with a rapid movement, without, however, stirring from the\r\nspot, as though to drive away the enemy that had just approached,\r\nwhereas, in any other circumstances, she would at once have flown away\r\nor sought to escape, which proves that she was remaining only to defend\r\nher young.”\r\n\r\nM. Karl de Geer has observed that it is chiefly against the male of her\r\nspecies that the mother Bug is obliged to defend her young, because he\r\ntries to devour them wherever he comes upon them; and on such occasions\r\nshe always tries with all her might to protect them against his\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nIn his Curiosités d’historie naturelle, Boitard still farther\r\nembellishes the picture of family life painted by De Geer:\r\n\r\n“It is most curious,” he says, “to see how the mother Bug, when a few\r\ndrops of rain are falling, leads her young under a leaf or the fork of\r\na branch to shelter them. Even there her anxious affection is not\r\nreassured; she drives them into a closely-packed flock, places herself\r\nin their midst and covers them with her wings, which she spreads over\r\nthem umbrella-wise; and, in spite of the discomfort of her position,\r\nshe retains this attitude of a brooding Hen until the storm has blown\r\nover.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShall I confess it? This umbrella made of the mother’s wings during\r\nshowery weather, this procession of a Hen leading her Chicks, this\r\ndevotion in warding off the attacks of a father inclined to devour his\r\nfamily leave me just a little incredulous, without surprising me,\r\nexperience having taught me that the books are full of little anecdotes\r\nincapable of surviving the ordeal of a strict investigation.\r\n\r\nAn incomplete observation, wrongly interpreted, sets the story going.\r\nThen come the compilers, who faithfully hand down the legend, the\r\nunsound fruit of the imagination; and error, confirmed by repetition,\r\nbecomes an article of faith. What, for example, was not reported of the\r\nSacred Beetle and her pill, the Necrophorus [56] and her work of\r\nburial, the Hunting Wasp and her game, the Cicada and her well, before\r\nthe truth was arrived at? The real, which is perfectly simple, and\r\nsupremely beautiful, too often escapes us, giving way before the\r\nimaginary, which is less troublesome to acquire. Instead of going back\r\nto the facts and seeing for ourselves, we blindly follow tradition.\r\nTo-day no one would write a few lines on the Pentatomæ without dragging\r\nin the Swedish naturalist’s doubtful story, and no one, as far as I\r\nknow, has mentioned the genuine marvels connected with the mechanism of\r\nthe hatching.\r\n\r\nWhat can De Geer have seen? The observer’s high standing gives us\r\nconfidence; none the less, I shall take the liberty of experimenting in\r\nmy turn before accepting the master’s statements.\r\n\r\nThe Grey Bug, the subject of my story, is less frequent than the others\r\nin my neighbourhood: on the rosemaries in the enclosure, my field of\r\nexploration, I find three or four which, when placed under glass, do\r\nnot give me any eggs. The set-back does not seem irreparable: what the\r\ngrey refuses to reveal the green or the yellow or the red-and-black\r\nstriped—one and all of similar formation and like habits—will show me.\r\nIn species so closely akin, the family cares of the one must, in all\r\nbut a few details, be reproduced in the others. Let us then note how\r\nthe four Pentatomæ reared in captivity behave in the matter of their\r\nnew-born young. Their unanimous testimony will convince us.\r\n\r\nAt the very outset I was struck by a fact which disagreed with what I\r\nhad a right to expect in a future Hen leading her Chicks. The mother\r\npays no attention to her eggs. When the last has been laid in its place\r\nat the extreme end of the last row, she makes off, heedless of what she\r\nhas left behind her. She does not trouble about it any more, does not\r\nreturn to it. If the hazards of her wanderings lead her up to it, she\r\nsteps on the heap, crosses it and passes on, indifferent. The evidence\r\nleaves nothing to be desired: the coming upon a patch of eggs is an\r\nincident of no interest to the mother.\r\n\r\nWe must not attribute this negligence to the aberrations which may\r\npossibly occur in a state of captivity. In the perfect liberty of the\r\nfields I have come across many batches of eggs, perhaps including those\r\nof the Grey Bug; never have I seen the mother standing by her eggs,\r\nwhich she would have to do if her family required protection as soon as\r\nhatched.\r\n\r\nThe gravid mother is a quick flier and of a vagabond temperament. Once\r\nshe has flown to a considerable distance from the leaf which has\r\nreceived her eggs, how is she to remember, two or three weeks later,\r\nthat the hour for hatching is at hand? How is she to find her eggs\r\nagain? Moreover, how is she to distinguish them from those of another\r\nmother? To believe her capable of such feats of clairvoyance and memory\r\nin the immensity of the open fields would be midsummer madness.\r\n\r\nNever, I say, did I detect a mother permanently posted beside the eggs\r\nwhich she had fastened to a leaf. Further, the total emission is split\r\nup into partial deposits dispersed at random, so that the whole tribe\r\ncomprises a series of clans encamped here and there, often removed to\r\nconsiderable distances which it is impossible to specify.\r\n\r\nTo rediscover these flocks at the time of the hatching, which falls\r\nearlier or later according to the date of production and the degree of\r\nexposure to the sun; then, from all over the country-side, to gather\r\ninto one herd the whole of her very frail and short-legged offspring:\r\nthis were an obvious impossibility. Let us nevertheless suppose that,\r\nby a stroke of good fortune, one of these groups is found and\r\nrecognized and that the mother devotes herself to it. The others are\r\nnecessarily abandoned. They thrive none the less well for that. Why,\r\nthen, should some of the young Bugs be so strangely favoured by\r\nmaternal solicitude while the majority are able to do without it? Such\r\npeculiarities make one suspicious.\r\n\r\nDe Geer speaks of groups of twenty. These, we are forced to believe,\r\nwere not the complete family, but detachments sprung from a partial\r\nlaying. A Pentatoma smaller than the Grey Bug has given me, in one\r\nsingle deposit, more than a hundred eggs. This fecundity must be the\r\ngeneral rule where the mode of life is the same. Apart from the twenty\r\nwatched, then, what became of the rest, left to their own devices?\r\n\r\nWith all due respect to the Swedish naturalist, the tender cares of the\r\nmother Bug and the unnatural appetites of the father eating his\r\nchildren must be relegated to the fairy-tales with which history is\r\ncrammed. I can obtain, in my breeding-cages, as many hatchings as I\r\nwish. The parents are close at hand, under the same cover. What do they\r\ndo respectively in the presence of the little ones?\r\n\r\nNothing whatever: the fathers do not hasten to slaughter their brats\r\nnor do the mothers hasten to their rescue. They wander to and fro on\r\nthe wire trellis; they take their rest in the restaurant provided by a\r\ntuft of rosemary; they pass through the groups of new-born Bugs and\r\ntopple them over, without evil intent, but also without the least\r\nconsideration. They are so small, the poor little wretches, and so\r\nfeeble! A passer-by who grazes them with the tip of his foot turns them\r\nover on their backs. Like overturned Tortoises, they vainly kick and\r\nwriggle; no one heeds them.\r\n\r\nCome then, O devoted mother! Since your family is beset by the danger\r\nof capsizing and other disagreeable accidents, place yourself at their\r\nhead; lead them, step by step, into peaceful pastures; cover them with\r\nthe buckler of your wing-cases! Any one waiting to observe these\r\nbeautiful actions, these admirable and edifying moral characteristics,\r\nwill waste his time and his patience. In three months of diligent\r\nwatching I never saw, on the part of my charges, any action which in\r\nany way suggested the maternal solicitude so often extolled by the\r\ncompilers of history.\r\n\r\nNature the universal nurse, alma parens rerum, is infinitely tender in\r\nher treatment of the germs, the treasure of the future; she is a harsh\r\nstep-mother to the parent. As soon as the creature is capable of\r\nsupporting itself, she delivers it without pity to life’s cruel\r\nschooling, which teaches it to resist in the fierce struggle for\r\nexistence. At first a tender mother, she gives the Pentatoma a\r\ndelightful casket with a sealed lid to guard the budding flesh from\r\nharm; she caps the tiny insect with a mechanical device to set it free,\r\na masterpiece of delicate ingenuity; and then, a stern schoolmistress,\r\nshe says to the little one:\r\n\r\n“I am leaving you. You must now fend for yourself in the hurly-burly of\r\nthe world.”\r\n\r\nAnd the little insect does fend for itself. I see the new-born Bugs,\r\npressed close against one another, remaining for some days on the patch\r\nof empty egg-shells. Their flesh grows firmer and their colouring\r\nbrighter. Mothers pass at no great distance: none of them pays any\r\nattention to the drowsy company.\r\n\r\nWhen hunger comes, one of the little ones moves away from the group in\r\nsearch of a canteen; the others follow; they love to feel shoulder\r\ntouching shoulder, like grazing Sheep. The first to move draws the\r\nwhole band after him; they make their way in a flock to the tender\r\nspots where they insert their suckers and drink their fill; whereupon\r\nall return to their native village, seeking a resting-place on the tops\r\nof the empty eggs. These expeditions in common are repeated within an\r\nincreasing radius, till at last, having grown a little stronger, the\r\ncommunity, becoming emancipated, makes off and disperses, no longer\r\nreturning to the place of its birth. Henceforth each lives as he\r\npleases.\r\n\r\nWhat would happen if, when the flock is moving about, a mother were\r\nencountered, slow-stepping as the sober Bugs so often are? The little\r\nones, I fancy, would confidently follow their chance-met leader as they\r\nfollow those among themselves who are the first to make a start. We\r\nshould then see something like the Hen at the head of her Chicks;\r\naccident would give all the appearance of maternal solicitude to a\r\nstranger quite indifferent to the mob of brats at her heels.\r\n\r\nThe worthy De Geer, it seems to me, must have been deceived by such\r\nmeetings as these, in which maternal care played no part whatever. A\r\nlittle colouring, by way of involuntary adornment, completed the\r\npicture; and since then the domestic virtues of the Grey Bug have been\r\nlauded in all the books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE MASKED BUG\r\n\r\n\r\nI met with this insect unexpectedly and in circumstances that hardly\r\nseemed to promise an interesting discovery. A certain enquiry into the\r\nspoilers of dead meat, an enquiry set forth elsewhere, [57] had brought\r\nme to the village butcher’s. What will not one do in the hope of\r\nsecuring an idea! The hunt after this rare quarry led me to the\r\nworkshop of the slaughterer, an excellent man, for that matter, who did\r\nme the honours of his establishment to the best of his ability.\r\n\r\nI wanted to see not the actual shop, so hateful to look upon, but the\r\nshed or what not in which the offal was collected. The butcher took me\r\nto the garret, dimly lit by a dormer-window which was left open night\r\nand day, in all weathers, to air the place. Continuous ventilation was\r\nnot unwelcome in that nauseous atmosphere, above all at the hottest\r\ntime of year, when my visit was paid. The mere recollection of that\r\ngarret is revolting to my senses.\r\n\r\nHere, on a stretched cord, some blood-stained sheepskins are drying; in\r\none corner is a heap of stinking tallow, in another are bones, horns\r\nand hoofs. These rags and tatters of death answer my purpose capitally.\r\nUnder the shovelfuls of fat which I turn over, the Dermestes and her\r\ngrub are swarming by the thousand; Clothes-moths flit indolently to and\r\nfro; and Flies with big red eyes keep on buzzing in and out of the\r\nhollow bones that still hold a little marrow. I expected this\r\npopulation, the habitual inmates of carrion refuse. But here is one\r\nwhich I did not anticipate: On the whitewashed wall are certain black\r\npatches of unsightly insects, gathered in motionless groups. Among them\r\nI recognize the Masked Bug, or Masked Reduvius (R. personatus, LIN.), a\r\nlarge Bug of some celebrity. There are nearly a hundred of them,\r\ndivided into separate flocks.\r\n\r\nThe butcher watches me as I capture my discovery and put it into a box,\r\nand is surprised to see me fearlessly handling the repulsive creature.\r\nIt is more than he would ever venture to do.\r\n\r\n“It comes and plasters itself against the wall,” he tells me, “and\r\nthere it stays. If I sweep it off, next day it’s back, as sure as fate.\r\nI don’t say it does any harm. It doesn’t spoil my hides, it doesn’t\r\ntouch my fats. What does it come here for every summer? I don’t know.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know either,” I reply, “but I shall try to find out; and, when\r\nI know, I can tell you about it, if you’d like me to. It may have\r\nsomething to do with the preservation of your hides. We shall see.”\r\n\r\nBehold me then, as I leave this offal-store, the shepherd of a\r\nchance-met flock. They are not much to look at. Covered with dust,\r\nblack as pitch, flat, like the true Bugs that they are, standing\r\nawkwardly high on their legs, lanky and skinny: no, they do not inspire\r\nconfidence. The head is so small that there is only just room for the\r\neyes, reticulated domes whose great prominence seems to indicate good\r\npowers of vision by night. It is set on an absurd neck which looks as\r\nthough it had been strangled with a bow-string. The corselet is\r\njet-black, with burnished prominences.\r\n\r\nLet us turn it over. The beak is monstrous. Its base covers all of the\r\nface that is not occupied by the eyes. It is not the usual rostrum, the\r\ndrill of the sap-sucking Hemiptera; it is a rude implement, an elbowed\r\ntool, crooked like a bent forefinger. What can the creature do with\r\nthis barbarous weapon? When it is feeding I see a black thread, as fine\r\nas a hair, issuing from the beak. This is the slender scalpel: the rest\r\nis the sheath and the stout handle. This rude equipment tells us that\r\nthe Reduvius is an executioner.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of exploits can we expect from it? Stabbing and murdering:\r\nactions of little interest, because of their frequency. But we must\r\nmake a considerable allowance for the unexpected; interesting details\r\nsometimes lie dormant and spring up suddenly amid squalid surroundings.\r\nPerhaps the Reduvius has in store for us facts worthy of record. Let us\r\ntry to rear him.\r\n\r\nHis weapon, a stout yataghan, tells us that the Reduvius is a murderer.\r\nWhat victim does he require? This is the rearing problem before us. It\r\nso happens that some time ago I saw the dingy-looking Bug at grips with\r\nthe smallest of our Cetoniæ, so well-named the Pall-bearing Cetonia,\r\n[58] because of her white spots on a black background. This accidental\r\nobservation sets me on the right track. I house my flock in a large\r\nglass jar with a bed of sand, and as food I serve up the Cetonia\r\naforesaid, which is common in spring on the flowers in the enclosure,\r\nbut scarce at this time of year. The victim is very readily accepted.\r\nNext day I find her dead. One of the Reduvii, with his probe implanted\r\nin the joint of the neck, is working at the corpse and draining it dry.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Cetoniæ I fall back upon any sort of game suited to\r\nthe size of my boarders; and I find that any sort answers my purpose,\r\nirrespective of the different entomological orders. The usual dish,\r\nbecause it is the easiest for me to capture, consists of Locusts of\r\nmedium size, though they are sometimes larger than the consumer. Often,\r\ntoo, for the same reason that he is easily obtained, it includes a\r\nForest Bug, Pentatoma nigricorna. In short, my charges’ diet does not\r\ngive me much trouble: anything will do, provided that the prey does not\r\nexceed the powers of the assailant.\r\n\r\nI was anxious to witness the attack, but I never managed to do so. As\r\nthe big, prominent eyes of the Reduvius warned me, it takes place at\r\nnight, at unseasonable hours. However early my inspection, I find the\r\ngame lifeless, bereft of all power of movement. The hunter is feasting\r\nupon his prey and lingers over it for some part of the morning. Then,\r\nafter many different applications of the probe, now at one point and\r\nnow at another, when the victims are completely drained of moisture,\r\nthe blood-suckers abandon the dead bodies, gather into a flock, and do\r\nnot move all day long, lying flat on the sand at the bottom of the jar.\r\nOn the following night, if I renew the victuals, the same massacres are\r\nrepeated.\r\n\r\nWhen the prey is a non-armoured insect, a Locust, for example, I have\r\nsometimes noted pulsations in the victim’s abdomen. Death, therefore,\r\nis not sudden and overwhelming; nevertheless, the quarry must be very\r\nquickly made incapable of resistance.\r\n\r\nI have confronted the Reduvius with a big-jawed Decticus, a Platycleis\r\n[59] five or six times the size of his executioner. Next day the\r\ncolossus was sucked dry by the dwarf as quickly as a Fly would have\r\nbeen. A terrible stab had paralysed him. Where was the blow delivered\r\nand how did it take effect?\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to tell us that the Reduvius is a bravo versed in the\r\nart of murder, acquainted, like the Paralysing Wasps, with the anatomy\r\nof his victims and the secrets of their nerve-centres. No doubt he\r\ndrives his stiletto at random into any part where the skin is soft\r\nenough. He kills by injecting venom. His rostrum is a poisoned dagger,\r\nlike that of the Gnat, but much more virulent.\r\n\r\nIt is said, indeed, that the Masked Bug’s bite is painful. Wishing\r\nmyself to test its effects, so that I might speak with authority, I\r\nhave tried, but in vain, to get myself bitten. When placed on my finger\r\nand pestered, the insect refused to unsheath its weapon. Frequent\r\nhandling of my specimens, without the use of tweezers, was no more\r\nsuccessful. On the evidence of others, then, and not from my own\r\nexperience, I believe the Reduvius’ bite to be a serious matter.\r\n\r\nIt must be so, intended as it is to kill, swiftly an insect that is not\r\nalways devoid of vigour. To the victim surprised when asleep it must\r\nmean the shooting pain and sudden numbness which the Wasp’s sting would\r\nproduce. The blow is struck here or there, at random. It is possible\r\nthat the bandit, once the wound has been inflicted, keeps his distance\r\nfor a while and waits for the limbs to cease kicking before sitting\r\ndown to devour the corpse. Spiders who have caught a dangerous prey in\r\ntheir webs are wont to take this precaution. They withdraw a little to\r\none side and await the last convulsions of the fettered victim.\r\n\r\nThough the details of the murder escape me, I know how the dead insect\r\nis exploited. I can witness the performance any morning, as often as I\r\nwish. The Reduvius projects from the clumsy scabbard, crooked like a\r\nfore-finger, a delicate black lancet, which is at once a probe and a\r\nsuction-pump. The implement is driven into any point of the victim’s\r\nbody, provided that it be covered with skin. Then comes absolute\r\nimmobility; the banqueter does not budge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the lancets of the sucker are working, sliding one against\r\nthe other, acting as a pump, imbibing the victim’s life-blood. In like\r\nfashion the Cicada drinks the sap of her tree. When she has drained one\r\npart of the bark, she moves on and sinks another well. The Reduvius\r\ndoes the same; he drains his prey at several points. He goes from the\r\nback of the head to the abdomen, from the abdomen to the neck, from the\r\nneck to the thorax and the joints of the legs. Everything is done\r\neconomically.\r\n\r\nI watch with interest the tactics of a Bug exploiting his Locust.\r\nTwenty times over I see him changing his point of attack and stopping\r\nfor a longer or shorter time according to the wealth encountered. He\r\nends up with a haunch, attacked at the joint. The barrel is emptied of\r\nits juices until it becomes translucent. If the quarry’s skin is\r\ndiaphanous, the same degree of exhaustion may be perceived throughout\r\nthe body. Thanks to the action of the infernal pump, a young Praying\r\nMantis an inch long becomes transparent as a moulted skin.\r\n\r\nThese blood-sucking appetites remind me of our Bed-bug, who makes\r\nhimself so obnoxious by exploring the sleeper, selecting a convenient\r\nspot, leaving it for another and a more profitable, and again moving\r\non, until, swollen to the size of a currant, he withdraws at the first\r\nglimmer of daylight. The Reduvius aggravates this method: he first\r\nbenumbs his victim and then drains it dry. Only the legendary vampire\r\nof romance achieves a like degree of frightfulness.\r\n\r\nNow, what was the insect-sucker doing in a butcher’s loft? He certainly\r\ndid not find there the victims which I procure for him: Locusts, young\r\nMantes, Grasshoppers, Chrysomelæ, [60] all lovers of foliage and the\r\nsunlight. These passionate lovers of open-air joys would never venture\r\ninto the dark and nauseating offal-store. What, then, do these black\r\nsquads clinging to the wall live upon? Such a crowd needs food, and\r\nplenty of it. Where is it?\r\n\r\nIn the heap of fats, of course! Here a Dermestes (D. Frischii, KUGEL)\r\n[61] swarms promiscuously with her hairy larvæ. The supply is\r\ninexhaustible, and it is probably that the Reduvii hastened hither\r\nattracted by this abundance. Let us then change the bill of fare, let\r\nus substitute Dermestes.\r\n\r\nI have just what is needed at my disposal without rushing off to the\r\nbutcher’s for a supply. In the garden, at this moment, supported on\r\nreed tripods, there are certain aerial retting-vats in which Moles,\r\nSnakes, Lizards, Toads, Fish and so on attract interminable visits from\r\nthe undertakers of the neighbourhood. The most numerous is a Dermestes,\r\nprecisely the same as the one in the tallow-loft. This is the very\r\nthing I want.\r\n\r\nI serve this Dermestes to my Reduvii, I serve him up lavishly. A\r\nfrenzied massacre takes place. Every morning the sand in the jar is\r\nstrewn with corpses, many of which are still lying beneath the\r\nmurderer’s beak. The conclusion is obvious: the Reduvius kills the\r\nDermestes whenever the opportunity occurs; without having an exclusive\r\ntaste for this sort of game, he bleeds it, more or less eagerly, when\r\nhe comes across it.\r\n\r\nI shall communicate this result to the worthy fellow to whom I owe the\r\ningredients of this story. I shall tell him:\r\n\r\n“Leave them alone, the ugly creatures whom you see sleeping on the\r\nwalls of your loft; don’t drive them away with your broom. They are\r\ndoing you a service; they wage war upon the others, the Dermestes, who\r\nare so destructive to hides.”\r\n\r\nIt may well be that the abundance of Dermestes, an easy prey, was not\r\nthe motive which attracted the Reduvii to the butcher’s garret.\r\nElsewhere, out of doors, there is no lack of game, in great variety and\r\nno less appreciated. Why do the Bugs prefer to gather here? I suspect\r\nthat they wish to establish a family. The laying-season cannot be far\r\naway; and the Reduvius has come with the particular object of providing\r\nfood and lodging for her offspring. In fact, at the end of June I\r\nobtain the first eggs in my jars. For a fortnight the Bugs continue to\r\nlay abundantly. A few mothers, reared separately, enable me to estimate\r\ntheir fecundity. I count up thirty to forty eggs for each mother.\r\n\r\nHere we no longer see the orderliness dear to the Forest-bugs, who\r\narrange their eggs on a leaf so methodically, in rows of beads. Far\r\nfrom representing an extremely accurate piece of work, the Masked Bug’s\r\nbatch of eggs is strewn, clumsily, at random. The eggs are isolated,\r\nadhering neither to one another nor to their support. In my\r\nrearing-jars they are scattered over the surface of the sand. Granular\r\nspecks of which the mother has taken no care whatever, not even\r\ntroubling to fasten them anywhere, they roll hither and thither, at the\r\nleast breath of air. A plant is not more heedless of its seeds, which\r\ngo where the wind blows them.\r\n\r\nThese greatly neglected eggs are nevertheless not without beauty of\r\nform; they are oval, amber-red, smooth and glossy and about a\r\nmillimetre [62] in length. Near one of the ends there is a fine, dark,\r\ncircular line, marking a sort of cap. The Forest-bug’s egg has taught\r\nus the meaning of this circle. It is the line along which the lid of\r\nthe casket will open. We have before us for the second time the tiny\r\nmiracle of an egg shaped like a casket, which, on hatching, opens\r\nwithout breaking, by the fall of a little lid which is thrust back by\r\nthe tiny creature in the act of birth.\r\n\r\nIf I can manage to see how the moveable cap is lifted, I shall obtain\r\nthe most interesting detail of the Masked Bug’s history; I shall have\r\nthe equivalent of the young Forest-bug bursting the ceiling of his\r\nshell by means of a sharp-angled mitre actuated by the hydraulic\r\npulsations of the head. Let us stint neither time nor patience: the\r\nexodus of a Bug from his egg is a most notable sight.\r\n\r\nIf the problem has its attractive side, it also presents difficulties.\r\nYou have to be on the spot just at the very moment when the lid gives\r\nway, which entails a wearisome vigilance. You also want plenty of\r\nlight; and it must be daylight, or the refinements of this very\r\ndelicate operation would escape us. The habits of the Reduvius give me\r\ncause to fear that the eggs may be hatched at night: [And the future\r\nwill teach me only too well how fully my fears are founded.] No matter:\r\nwe will not give in. Perhaps fortune will smile upon me. And, lens in\r\nhand, for a fortnight, at all hours, from morning to night, I keep\r\nwatch over a hundred eggs which I have divided among several glass\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\nIn the Forest-bug’s egg the approach of hatching is announced by a\r\nblack line in the form of a broad arrow, or reversed anchor, which\r\nappears not far from the lid and is no other than the liberating\r\nmechanism. The tiny beast covers its head with its pointed mitre. Here\r\nthere is nothing of the sort. From first to last, the Masked Bug’s egg\r\nretains its uniform amber colouring, without any sign of an inner lock.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, by the middle of July, the hatchings are becoming numerous.\r\nEvery morning I find in my tubes a collection of tiny open pots,\r\nunbroken and amber-coloured as at the beginning. The lid, a concave\r\ndome of exquisite accuracy, is lying on the sand beside the empty\r\negg-shell; sometimes it remains hanging from the edge of the orifice.\r\nThe young Bugs, pretty little snow-white creatures, are gambolling\r\nnimbly amidst the untenanted pots. I always come too late; what I\r\nwanted to see by sunlight is over.\r\n\r\nAs I suspected, the opening of the lid is effected in the darkness of\r\nthe night. Alas, for want of sufficient light the solution of the\r\nproblem which interests me so greatly will escape me! The Reduvius will\r\nkeep her secret; I shall see nothing.... But yes, I do see something;\r\nfor perseverance has unexpected resources. A week full of failures has\r\nalready gone by, when, unexpectedly, in the brilliant light of nine\r\no’clock in the morning, a few late-comers suddenly begin to open their\r\nboxes. Had the house caught fire just then, I doubt whether I should\r\nhave stirred a limb. The sight held me rooted to the floor. Let the\r\nreader judge for himself.\r\n\r\nUnprovided with the thread-like rivets employed by the Pentatoma, the\r\nReduvius’ lid adheres to the shell by its mere position and a perfect\r\nfit. I see it lifting at one side and hinging on the other with a\r\nslowness that defies the magnifying powers of the lens. What is\r\nhappening in the egg seems to be a long and laborious process. But the\r\nlid opens wider; and through the chink I see something glistening. This\r\nis an iridescent pellicle, which protrudes, and, as it does so, pushes\r\nback the lid. Now a spherical blister emerges from the shell, gradually\r\ngrowing larger, like a soap-bubble blown from a straw. Pushed farther\r\nand farther back by the expansion of this bladder, the lid falls off.\r\n\r\nThen the bomb explodes: that is to say, the capsule, inflated beyond\r\nthe limits of its resistance, bursts open at the top. This envelope, an\r\nextremely thin membrane, usually adheres to the edge of the orifice,\r\nwhere it forms a high white rim. At other times the explosion detaches\r\nit and shoots it out of the shell. Under these conditions it is a\r\ndelicate goblet, hemispherical, with torn edges, and with its lower\r\npart continued by a fine, twisted stem.\r\n\r\nIt is finished; the thoroughfare is open. The tiny insect can now\r\nemerge by bursting through the pellicle caught in the opening, or by\r\ndislodging it; or it may find an absolutely free passage, when the\r\nburst bladder has left the egg. It is all simply miraculous. To escape\r\nfrom his box, the Pentatoma invented the three-ribbed mitre and the\r\nhydraulic ram; the Reduvius has invented the explosive bomb. The first\r\ngoes to work gently; the second, a brutal dynamiter, blows the roof off\r\nhis prison with a bomb.\r\n\r\nWith what explosive, and how is the liberating shell loaded? At the\r\nmoment of rupture nothing visible bursts from the bubble; nothing\r\nliquid moistens the torn edge. The contents, therefore, were assuredly\r\ngaseous. The rest escapes me. One observation, which I was unable to\r\nrepeat, is not enough in this delicate matter. Reducing it to mere\r\nprobabilities I will propose the following explanation:\r\n\r\nThe tiny animal is wrapped in a tightly closed tunic which embraces it\r\nsnugly. This is a temporary skin, a sheath which the new-born larva\r\nwill shed on leaving the egg. This sheath is connected with an\r\nappendage, a capsule placed under the lid. The twisted stem hanging\r\nfrom the burst bubble when it is shot out of the egg represents the\r\ncommunicating duct.\r\n\r\nVery slowly, as the little creature takes shape and grows, this\r\nbladder-like reservoir receives the products of the respiration which\r\ntakes place under the cover of the tunic or “overall.” Instead of\r\ndispersing outside, through the egg-shell, the carbonic acid gas\r\nincessantly resulting from the vital process of oxidization accumulates\r\nin this sort of gasometer, filling and distending it and pressing upon\r\nthe lid. When the little Bug is mature and on the point of hatching,\r\nthe increased activity of its respiration completes the inflation,\r\nwhich has doubtless been proceeding ever since the earliest development\r\nof the germ. At last, yielding to the increasing pressure of the\r\ngas-filled capsule, the lid becomes unfastened. The Chick in its shell\r\nhas its air-chamber: the young Reduvius has its bomb of carbonic acid\r\ngas: it releases itself by breathing.\r\n\r\nThe singular hatching-processes of the Pentatoma and the Reduvius are\r\nobviously not isolated cases. The egg with a removable lid must be\r\nemployed by other Hemiptera; it may even be that this is a fairly\r\ngeneral device. Each genus has its own methods of opening its box, its\r\nown system of springs and levers. What a mechanism to find in the egg\r\nof a Bug, and how fertile in surprises! What an interesting harvest to\r\nbe reaped, with patience and a good pair of eyes!\r\n\r\nLet us now watch the little Reduvius’ emergence. The lid fell off a few\r\nmoments ago. The tiny insect, white all over, comes forth, tightly\r\nswaddled. The tip of its abdomen still remains within the opening,\r\nwhich, with its rim of skin, the remnant of the bomb, serves it as a\r\nsupporting girdle. It struggles, swaying to and fro and leaning\r\nbackwards. This gymnastic exercise, increasing the creature’s\r\nflexibility, is intended to undo the swaddling-clothes at the seams.\r\nSleeves, breeches, gaiters, shirt-front, cap: little by little the\r\nwhole is torn off, not without effort on the fettered pigmy’s part; it\r\nis all cast aside and disappears in tatters. Behold the new-born insect\r\nat liberty! It skips away to some distance from the egg. With its long,\r\nfine, waving antennæ it interrogates space, enquiring into this mighty\r\nworld. Often, when the lid still adheres to some point of the opening,\r\nit carries this bit away with it, on its back or its rump. You would\r\nthink it was going to the wars, bearing the umbo of antiquity, the\r\nround, convex buckler. What does it want with this armour? Has it\r\nseized upon it as a means of defence? Not at all. The cover of the\r\nbeaker happened to come into contact with it and at once stuck to it,\r\neven firmly, for nothing short of the approaching moult will detach the\r\ndisk. This detail tells us that the little creature exudes a fluid\r\ncapable of acting as an adhesive in respect of any light objects\r\nencountered on its passage—with what results we shall presently see.\r\n\r\nWith shield on back or without this panoply, standing high on its legs\r\nand sporting a long pair of horns, the new-born insect crosses the\r\nthreshold of the egg; it roams about in sudden fits and starts,\r\npresenting the appearance of a minute Spider. Two days later, before\r\ntaking any food, it undergoes a moult. The gormandizer, once he has\r\neaten his fill, undoes a button to make room for the belated dainties\r\nconcluding the meal. The Bug, who has as yet eaten nothing, splits his\r\ncoat from top to bottom, throws it away, and puts on a new skin. He\r\neven changes his belly before sitting down to table. He used to wear a\r\nshort, stumpy abdomen; he now has a plump, round paunch. The time has\r\ncome for feasting.\r\n\r\nA restaurant-keeper with no experience of the proper bill of fare, what\r\nshall I provide? I remember a passage in Linnæus [63] touching the\r\nReduvius. The master says:\r\n\r\n“Consumit cimices lectularios huius larva, horrida, personata.” “Its\r\nhorrid, masked larva sucks the Bed-bugs.”\r\n\r\nThis game seems to me out of proportion for the moment: the little\r\ncreatures in my jars, weak and tiny as they are, would never dare to\r\ntackle such a quarry. There is another objection: the moment I want\r\nBugs, I am unlikely to find any. Let us try something else.\r\n\r\nThe adult has eclectic tastes; it hunts the most varied prey. The larva\r\nmight well do likewise. I offer Midges. They are absolutely refused. In\r\nthe garret whence my flock originated, what could they have found that\r\nwas easily obtained, without scuffling, so dangerous at that tender\r\nage? They would have found tallow, bones, hides, and nothing else. Let\r\nus give them tallow.\r\n\r\nThis time all goes well. My little creatures settle down on the fatty\r\nsubstance, driving their suckers into it, drinking deeply of the\r\nstinking olein, and then retire to digest their meal in the sand,\r\nwherever they please. They thrive. I see them growing from day to day.\r\nIn a fortnight they are plump, and, what is more, disguised beyond\r\nrecognition. Their whole bodies, including the legs, are encrusted with\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nThis mineral bark began to form directly after the moult. The little\r\ncreatures became speckled with earthy particles, thinly scattered at\r\nrandom. At present the envelope is continuous. Let matters take their\r\ncourse, and this wrap will become a sordid overall. Then the larva will\r\nreally deserve the epithets which Linnæus bestows upon it: horrida,\r\npersonata, the horrible insect that dons a mask and wears a dusty\r\ndomino.\r\n\r\nShould it occur to us to regard this tatter-demalion costume as an\r\nintentional piece of work, a ruse de guerre, a means of dissimulation\r\nwhereby to approach its prey, we may undeceive ourselves: the Reduvius\r\ndoes not industriously make itself an overcoat; nor does it wear one\r\nwith the object of concealing itself. It all happens of itself, without\r\nany sort of art, like the mechanism whose secret was revealed to us by\r\nthe lid of the egg, worn as a buckler. The insect exudes a certain\r\nunctuous humour, derived perhaps from the tallow on which it feeds. To\r\nthis varnish, the dust through which it passes adheres without any\r\nfurther trouble on the insect’s part. The Reduvius does not dress\r\nitself; it dirties itself; it turns into a pellet of dust, a walking\r\nbit of filth, because it emits a sticky sweat.\r\n\r\nOne word more as to its diet. Linnæus, obtaining his information I know\r\nnot where, makes the Reduvius our auxiliary against the Bed-bug. Since\r\nthen, the books, monotonously echoing one another, have repeated the\r\neulogy; it is accepted as a tradition that the Masked Reduvius makes\r\nwar upon our nocturnal bloodsucker. This would certainly constitute a\r\nmagnificent claim on our gratitude. But is it really the truth? I take\r\nthe liberty of rebelling against tradition. That the Reduvius is\r\nsometimes found slaying Bed-bugs is very likely: my own captives were\r\nsatisfied with Forest-bugs. They accepted them, however, without\r\nclamouring for them; and they readily dispensed with them, seeming to\r\nprefer Locusts or any other insects.\r\n\r\nLet us not then hasten to generalize and to look upon the Reduvius as a\r\nlicensed consumer of the stinking pest of our beds. I see an important\r\nobjection to this special vocation. Comparatively large in size, the\r\nReduvius could not slip into the narrow chinks that shelter the\r\nBed-bug. A fortiori, to track the Bed-bug to its lair is impracticable\r\nfor the larva, hampered by its overcoat of dust, unless it invade our\r\nbeds at the time when the other is running over us and selecting its\r\nmorsel. Nothing justifies our presuming this intimacy with the sleeper;\r\nno one, that I know of, has surprised the Reduvius or its larva in the\r\nact of investigating our beds.\r\n\r\nThe masked larva does not deserve to be extolled for a few accidental\r\ncaptures. Its diet is quite different from what Linnæus tells us and\r\nthe compilers keep on repeating. In its infancy it feeds on fatty\r\nmatters, as my rearing-experiments prove. When it grows big it varies\r\nits victuals with insects, of no matter what order, as does the adult.\r\nFor it a butcher’s garret is an abode of bliss, where it finds a supply\r\nof fats, and, later, Flesh-flies, Dermestes, and other insects that\r\nbatten on dead things. In the dark and ill-swept corners of our houses\r\nit gleans the particles of fat that fall from our kitchen-table; it\r\ncatches unawares the drowsy Fly, the small, homeless Spider. This is\r\nenough to ensure its welfare.\r\n\r\nHere is one more tradition to be deleted from our books, without much\r\ninjury, however, to the insect’s reputation. If the Masked Bug ceases\r\nto appear in history as the executioner of the Bed-bug, it will\r\nhenceforth cut a more respectable figure as the inventor of the box\r\nthat is opened by the explosion of a bomb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE TEREBINTH-LOUSE: THE GALLS\r\n\r\n\r\nFor curious methods of generation, the Plant-lice bear the palm.\r\nNowhere shall we find anything to beat them unless we pry into the\r\nsecrets of the sea. We must not look to them for remarkable feats of\r\ninstinct. The humble, round-bellied Lice are incapable of such\r\nachievements; to these stay-at-homes the lifting of a foot spells an\r\nexcess of emancipation. But they will tell us by what attempts,\r\nbewildering in their energy and variety, the universal law that governs\r\nthe transmission of life has come into being.\r\n\r\nI shall consult the Terebinth-lice by preference. They are near\r\nneighbours of mine, a condition essential to frequent visits; they\r\npractise an industry, which is a not uninteresting addition; and they\r\nare crowded into sealed enclosures where we can follow the progress of\r\nthe family without too much confusion.\r\n\r\nThe shrub that feeds them, the terebinth, or turpentine-tree, abounds\r\non the Sérignan hills. It is sensitive to the cold, a lover of stony\r\nwastes scorched by the sun. Its insignificant flowers are succeeded by\r\npretty bunches of little berries, first pink, then blue, smelling of\r\nturpentine and beloved by the Redstart when migrating in autumn.\r\n\r\nAny one seeing it for the first time, unless conversant with its\r\nhistory, might think that it bore yet another crop of fruit, quite\r\ndifferent from that of the berries. On the tips of the boughs, singly\r\nor in bunches, are certain twisted horns, a fairly good imitation of\r\ncertain pimentos, if the coral-red of maturity were replaced by a\r\nstraw-yellow washed with rose. What is more, mimic apricots, fresher\r\nand more satiny than those of our orchards, are seen hanging from the\r\nleaves. Tempted by appearances, we open these deceptive productions.\r\nHorror! The contents consist of myriads of Lice, swarming about in the\r\nmidst of a floury dust.\r\n\r\nPilgrims to the Holy Land tell us that on certain bushes in the\r\nneighbourhood of Sodom beautiful-looking apples may be gathered, which\r\nare full of ashes within. The pretty apricots and cornute pimentos of\r\nthe terebinth-tree are the apples of Sodom, the Dead Sea fruit. Beneath\r\nan attractive exterior, they too contain nothing but ashes, live ashes,\r\na wriggling whirl of dusty vermin. These are excrescences, galls, in\r\nwhich the opulent family of the Plant-lice lives isolated from the\r\nouter world.\r\n\r\nTo follow the progress of these strange productions I needed a\r\nterebinth which I could inspect often and in comfort. I happen to have\r\none a few steps from my door. When I was stocking the enclosure with a\r\ncertain amount of woody vegetation, I conceived the happy thought of\r\nplanting a terebinth. A profitable tree, yielding acceptable fruit,\r\nwould have died in this ungrateful soil; but this, which is good for\r\nnothing but firewood, is prospering excellently. It has grown into a\r\nmagnificent specimen; and year after year it never fails to be covered\r\nwith galls. So here I am, the fortunate possessor of a tree full of\r\nLice. Let us call it by its Provençal name: lou Petelin, or lou\r\nPesouious, the lousy one.\r\n\r\nScarcely a day passes but I give it a glance, attracted as I am by the\r\ndaily happenings in the enclosure. Let us examine it closely. The\r\n“lousy one” has its merits: it is the depository of interesting\r\nsecrets. In winter it is bare. With the foliage the wigwams of Lice\r\nhave disappeared, though towards the end of the summer they were\r\nweighing it down with their numbers. Nothing is left but the\r\nhorn-shaped shells, now black and dilapidated ruins.\r\n\r\nWhat has become of the vast population of the bush? How will it recover\r\npossession of its terebinth? In vain I inspect the bark of the trunk\r\nand branches and twigs: I see nothing capable of explaining the coming\r\ninvasion. Nowhere are there any lice in a state of lethargy, nowhere\r\nany eggs awaiting the spring hatching. Nor are there any in the\r\nneighbourhood, nor, in particular, in the heap of dead leaves rotting\r\nat the foot of the tree. Yet the tiny creature cannot come from a\r\ndistance: a mere atom, as I see it in imagination, does not go\r\nwandering across country. It is certainly on the tree that feeds it;\r\nbut where?\r\n\r\nOne day in January, weary of my futile search, it occurs to me to strip\r\noff, in shreds, a lichen, the Wall Parmelia, which here and there\r\ncarpets thinly with its yellow rosettes the base and the thicker\r\nbranches of my terebinth. I examine my harvest through the lens, in my\r\nstudy. What is this?\r\n\r\nA magnificent discovery! In my scrap of lichen, no larger than a\r\nfinger-nail, I discover a world. On the inner surface, in the winding\r\ncrevices between the scales, are encrusted vast numbers of tiny red\r\nbodies barely a millimetre [64] in length. Some of them are entire and\r\noval in shape; some, truncated and empty, display open pouches with\r\npointed ends. All are plainly segmented.\r\n\r\nCan it be that I have before my eyes the Louse’s eggs, of which some\r\nare old and empty, while others are recent and contain their germ? This\r\nidea is soon disposed of: an egg has not this segmentation like that of\r\nan insect’s abdomen. Here is a more significant fact: a head and\r\nantennæ are visible in front, while legs may be seen underneath; the\r\nwhole is dry and brittle. These specks, accordingly, once lived and\r\nwalked. Are they dead now? No, for when I crush them with the point of\r\na needle traces of moisture gush forth, a sign of a living organism.\r\nOnly the shell is dead.\r\n\r\nThe tiny creature, capable at first of movement, endowed with legs and\r\nantennæ, wandered for some time under cover of the lichen; then, before\r\nit became inert, it settled down on a suitable spot. There it turned\r\nits shrivelled skin, now an amber-coloured pellicle, into a mummy’s\r\nsarcophagus in which the organism makes ready for a new life. When the\r\ntime comes, we shall discover the origin of this curious object, which\r\nwas an animal and now deserves the name of egg.\r\n\r\nWhat my own familiar terebinth has shown me in the enclosure, I ought\r\nto see repeated in the open country. Sure enough, I do see it; but this\r\ntime it is not under lichens, for the bark of the tree is most often\r\nbare. There is no lack of other shelter. Some twigs of terebinth have\r\nbeen cut by the clumsy bill-hooks of the brushwood-gleaners, leaving a\r\nragged section. The wood is split into deep fissures; the loose bark\r\ncomes away in tatters. Once dry, these ruins are a mine of wealth.\r\n\r\nIn the narrowest crevices, in the cracks of the wood and under the\r\nsplintered bark, there are great numbers of the atoms that interest me\r\nso greatly. To judge by their colour there are at least two kinds. Some\r\nare red; the others are black. These latter were scarce under the\r\nlichens on my terebinth; here they predominate largely. I collect some\r\nof both kinds. And now we must have patience. I have hopes that the\r\nanswer to the riddle will be found.\r\n\r\nMid-April comes and the little glass tubes in which I store my animal\r\nseeds are full of life. The black germs are the first to hatch; a\r\nfortnight later the red ones follow suit. The epidermic boxes undergo a\r\nprocess of self-mutilation, the front part falling off and leaving a\r\ngaping void, without other change of form. A minute animal comes out of\r\nthem, a black speck in which the lens recognizes a very shapely little\r\nLouse, bearing the regulation sucker pressed against its thorax. My\r\nfirst thoughts were correct: the puzzling little red and black bodies\r\nfound under the lichens and in the cracks of dead wood were really\r\nLouse-seeds.\r\n\r\nAnd these seeds, judging by their husks, endowed with a head and legs,\r\nare little insects, first active and then inert and converted into\r\ngerms. The original, almost integral substance is reborn in another\r\nshape. The little creature’s skin has provided the shell, the segmented\r\nbox, a jet-black or amber-yellow pellicule; the rest is concentrated\r\ninto an egg.\r\n\r\nThe time has not come to observe the singular creature’s origin and\r\nbehaviour; chronological order forbids. Let us return to the vermin\r\nissuing from these germs. They are tiny, tiny little black Lice, with\r\nflat abdomens, plainly segmented and as it were granular. Assiduous\r\nobservation through the lens shows them to be dusted with a touch of\r\nblue-grey powder like the bloom on a plum. Trotting with little steps\r\nabout their spacious prison, the glass tube, they seem uneasy. What do\r\nthey want? What are they looking for? No doubt, a camping-ground on the\r\nfriendly tree.\r\n\r\nI come to their assistance; I place in the tube a twig of terebinth\r\nwhose buds are beginning to open at the top of their scaly covering.\r\nThis is the thing they wanted. They climb up the twig, establish\r\nthemselves in the velvet that clothes the tips of the buds, and there\r\nthey settle, calm and satisfied.\r\n\r\nDirect observations made on the terebinth are accompanied, pari passu,\r\nby laboratory experiments. The little black Lice, rare on the 15th of\r\nApril, are numerous ten days later. On the tip of a single bud I count\r\nover twenty of them; and most of the buds are colonized, or at least\r\nthose that are largest and farthest from the ground. The occupants\r\nremain hidden in the scanty down of the nascent follicles whose tips\r\nare barely emerging.\r\n\r\nAfter a sojourn of some days, when the leaves begin to appear, each\r\ninsect makes for itself a private dwelling. It exploits, with its\r\nsucker, a leaflet whose tip turns purple, swells up and curls over,\r\nand, bringing its edges together, forms a flat pocket with an irregular\r\nopening. Each of these pockets, about the size of a grain of hemp-seed,\r\nis a tent in which a black Plant-louse takes up her residence: one\r\nonly, never more.\r\n\r\nWhat will the little Louse do in her isolated retreat? Feed, and, above\r\nall, multiply. If one is to become legion a few months hence, matters\r\nbrook no delay. Here, then, there is no father, a mere superfluity and\r\nwaste of time. So many Lice, so many mothers; no more is needed. Nor is\r\nthere any laying, for the egg would take too long to develop. Nothing\r\nshort of direct procreation, unfettered by any preliminaries, is\r\nacceptable to the Louse’s ardour. The young are born alive and like\r\ntheir mother, except in point of size.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they are brought into the world, they insert their suckers,\r\nabsorb a little sap, increase in size, and in a few days become capable\r\nof continuing the race by the same rapid method, without fathers. Until\r\nthe end of the annual colonization the offspring, including the\r\nremotest degrees of descent, will maintain the process of genesis by\r\ndirect parturition and will know no other method. When the time has\r\ncome for a more convenient examination, we shall return to this amazing\r\nmethod, which completely upsets our ideas.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May I open some of the purple swellings which have formed\r\non the tips of the burgeoning leaflets. Sometimes I find the maker of\r\nthe capsule alone, just as she was on the tips of the buds; sometimes\r\nshe has undergone a moult and is accompanied by the beginnings of a\r\nfamily. After discarding her black slough, she has become greenish,\r\ncorpulent and lightly dusted with flour. Her youngsters, at the moment\r\none or at most two, are brown, slender and bare-skinned.\r\n\r\nIn order to follow the progress of the family, I place under a glass a\r\ncouple of capsules which so far contain only the founder. Two days\r\nlater I have a dozen young Lice, who soon desert the natal pocket and\r\nmake for the cotton-wool closing the glass tube. This hasty migration\r\nindicates that the young Lice have their function elsewhere, on the\r\ntender, already unfolded leaves. Detached from its fostering support,\r\nthe little purple cell dries up and its inhabitant dies. My census can\r\nno longer be continued. No matter: I have learnt that one day is enough\r\nto produce three births. If this birth-rate persists for a fortnight,\r\nthe maker of the capsule will have brought forth a handsome family,\r\ngradually scattered over the wide field of exploitation offered by the\r\nterebinth.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later the red eggs hatch out, when the young twigs are\r\nalready shooting and unfolding their leaves. As far as I could judge\r\nfrom my highly unreliable observations of these swarming insects, which\r\nare not clearly distinguishable one from the other, the later\r\ngeneration begins as did the earlier. It causes purple nodules to\r\nappear on the tips of the leaflets, little wallets similar in shape and\r\nsize to a grape-stone. Like those already mentioned, these cells are\r\ninhabited at first by a single Plant-louse.\r\n\r\nIn both cases the rage for rapid multiplication is the same. The\r\nrecluses soon produce offspring, who desert the natal shelter and\r\nproceed to settle elsewhere as colonists. At last, its flanks drained\r\ndry, the viviparous little insect dies in its withered arbour.\r\n\r\nHow many were they, coming from under the lichens and climbing to the\r\nassault of the terebinth? There were thousands of them; and this\r\nmultitude is not enough. Hastily each Louse attacks her leaflet with\r\nher beak; she makes herself a lair out of its swollen tip and\r\nimmediately gives birth to other Lice, multiplying ten- or perhaps a\r\nhundredfold in this invasion of the innumerable. The tree has now its\r\nfull number of colonists, all capable of founding populous tribes.\r\n\r\nAre we to regard them as different branches of the same trade union, of\r\nthe same family, exploiting the terebinth in various fashions,\r\naccording to the point attacked? We hesitate to regard them as\r\nstrangers to one another, when they are employed on the same work; yet\r\nthere are significant reasons for concluding that we have here a\r\nduality or multiplicity of species.\r\n\r\nBesides the disparity of the work accomplished, there is, at the\r\noutset, one distinctive feature: the colour of the eggs, of which some\r\nare black and others red. These vividly contrasted hues must correspond\r\nwith independent ancestries. It is even possible that a patient\r\nexamination, capable of analysing this minute object, would find\r\ndifferences in husks of the same colour. All my own searches beneath\r\npatches of lichen and in the crevices of dead wood end in nothing more\r\nthan the discovery of two sorts of ovular carapaces but of two only, at\r\nleast to judge by appearances; and yet on the tree we shall find five\r\ncategories of workers who, though resembling one another, build very\r\ndissimilar structures. If there are no other germs, germs which have\r\nescaped my careful observation, it would seem, therefore that the eggs\r\nhave different contents under an identical shell, whether black or red.\r\n\r\nLastly, the configuration, that essential characteristic of the\r\nspecies, displays, in late autumn, very emphatic differentiating\r\nfeatures. Up to this late season, the inmates of the galls of every\r\nform are so much alike that it is impossible to distinguish them one\r\nfrom another once they are taken from their dwellings. When the final\r\nexodus comes, at the close of the year, a generation makes its\r\nappearance which differs greatly from its predecessors, giving final\r\nproof of multiple species, to the number of five.\r\n\r\nTheir generic name is Pemphigus, which is to say, bubble, capsule,\r\nbladder. This scientific name is well deserved. The Terebinth-lice and\r\nsome others that pursue similar callings, living on the elm and the\r\npoplar, are, in a word, artificers of swellings: by the incessant\r\ntickling of their suckers they cause the formation of hollow\r\nexcrescences, which are at once board and lodging to the community.\r\n\r\nOn the terebinth, the simplest of these dwellings consists of a lateral\r\nfold of the leaf, the edge of which is turned back over the upper\r\nsurface and fastened to it without losing its green colour. This hem\r\ngives a very low-roofed dwelling: the floor and the ceiling meet.\r\nTherefore, being unduly confined, the family is not numerous. The timid\r\nmaker of these green hems bears the name of Pemphigus pallidus, DERB.\r\nShe is called pale because she has not the knack of painting her house\r\npurple.\r\n\r\nElsewhere the lateral fold, still turned over the upper surface of the\r\nleaf, grows much thicker, swells with fleshy tissue, develops wrinkles,\r\nassumes a crimson hue and becomes a short, hollow, spindle-shaped\r\ngrowth. This home, a fairly successful imitation of the seed-pods of\r\nthe peony and the larkspur, belongs to the Pemphigus follicularius,\r\nPASS.\r\n\r\nElsewhere again the fold, which at first is made in the plane of the\r\nleaf, is now bent down at right angles under the leaf, becoming an\r\near-shaped appendage, a knotted, fleshy crescent, with a straw-yellow\r\nas its prevailing colour. This is the work of the Pemphigus\r\nsemilunaris, PASS.\r\n\r\nThe spherical galls take higher rank in the Plant-louse’s art. They are\r\nsmooth, pale-yellow globes, varying in size from that of a cherry to\r\nthat of an average apricot. They hang from the base of the leaves,\r\nwhich, despite these monstrous bladders, retain their normal colour,\r\nand, in all other respects, their normal shape. The insect which\r\ninflates these pretty capsules is Pemphigus utricularius, PASS.\r\n\r\nBut the most remarkable structures are the horn-shaped galls, truly\r\nCyclopean monuments compared with their minute builders. Some attain a\r\nlength of nine inches and are as thick as the neck of a claret-bottle.\r\nGrouped in threes or fours at the tips of the upper branches, they form\r\nbarbaric trophies, twisted and fantastic danger-signals which might\r\nhave graced the brows of some Alpine Ibex.\r\n\r\nThe other galls all fall off with the leaves; not a trace of them\r\nremains on the tree in winter, and even these firmly cemented to their\r\nbough, last for a long time. Only the protracted assaults of wind and\r\nweather will destroy them completely. The base itself does not easily\r\ndisappear. Next year it is still in its place, but dilapidated and\r\nreduced to the broken stump of a horn of plenty packed with the waxy\r\nfelt that clothed the population in the days of its prosperity. In\r\nthese palaces lived Pemphigus cornicularius, PASS.\r\n\r\nThe purple pitchers of the first phase are provisional stations in\r\nwhich the Lice prepare for wholesale colonization. Each of these humble\r\ncottages has its Plant-louse from the foot of the tree. The solitary,\r\nwho was herself hatched from a germ, makes haste to give birth to live\r\nyoungsters, who gradually spread over the new leaves, and die. Then the\r\ntrue galls come, the great cities which will provide room for several\r\ngenerations. Here again, all the five classes of specialists between\r\nwhom we have discriminated set to work, all labouring independently at\r\nthe first filling out of the cabins. Mutual assistance will come later.\r\n\r\nMay arrives; and already the simpler galls begin to grow: the lateral\r\nfolds which, bent back upon the edge, become so many green hems.\r\nBeneath the awl of the black Louse, patiently pricking away at the\r\nleaf, a narrow border curves inwards from the edge. The line of attack\r\nmeasures a couple of centimetres. [65] When it has worked long enough\r\nat this or that point, the tiny insect changes its place and goes\r\nelsewhere to begin all over again, standing motionless while its\r\nimplement performs its functions.\r\n\r\nNow what is the atom doing thus to warp what would be flat under\r\nnatural conditions? Merely implanting its sucker. The prick of a\r\nneedle, however skilfully guided, would bruise the tissues without\r\naffecting their form. The little insect must therefore instil a certain\r\nvirus, which provokes an exaggerated flow of sap; it injects an\r\nirritant poison and the plant reacts by the swelling of the wounded\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nAnd now the hem is growing wider, with a slowness that defies our\r\nscouting: as well try to follow with the eyes the growth of a blade of\r\ngrass. It is now a slanting roof, a gaping fold. The Louse is in the\r\nangle, at her post, doing her duty as a turncock. With her fine probe\r\nshe stimulates and controls the flow of sap. In twenty-four hours the\r\nroof completes its descent, pressing tightly against the leaf. It is a\r\nlowered trap-door; but the mechanism of the structure works with such\r\ncaution that the tiny insect, far from being crushed between the two\r\nthicknesses of leaf, retains its liberty of movement and moves about\r\ninside the fold as it would do in the open air.\r\n\r\nA curious instrument, the awl of the little black Louse! With our\r\nmodern machinery a child’s finger, applied to this or that lever, this\r\nor that valve, sets enormous masses in motion. Similarly, the Louse,\r\nwith her delicate probe, sets powerful hydraulic machinery going and\r\ntrims the sails of a leaflet. She is, after her fashion, an engineer on\r\na gigantic scale.\r\n\r\nThe spindle- or ear-shaped galls make their first appearance on the\r\nedge of the leaves in the form of narrow crimson borders. Soon the\r\nwalls grow thicker and become gnarled and fleshy, expanding into\r\nexcrescences from which all green is excluded.\r\n\r\nHow is it that the part of the leaf treated by the Louse is naturally\r\nyellow and crimson, when, if simply folded, it retains its normal green\r\nhue unimpaired? Again, how is it that in the one case the thickness of\r\nthe tissues is not increased while in the other it becomes augmented?\r\nWhy does the spindle keep to the plane of the edge, whereas the\r\near-shaped gall, or auricle, abruptly bends its leaf and hangs\r\nvertically? In all three cases, the implement is the same and the work\r\ndiffers profoundly. Is it the effect of a virus whose properties vary\r\naccording to the sucker that inoculates it? Is it the result of a\r\nchange of method in wielding the awl? We are confounded.\r\n\r\nThe problem becomes doubly obscure when we consider the spherical\r\ngalls. Here the original black Louse settles just at the base of a\r\nleaf, on the upper surface, against the median vein. There she takes\r\nher stand, motionless and patient. The point abraded by the awl is\r\nhollowed into a tiny pit, which soon forms a small protuberance beneath\r\nthe underside of the leaf. As though its foothold were gradually\r\nwithdrawn, the insect dives and is swallowed up by a pocket whose\r\nopening closes of its own accord by the contact of its lips.\r\n\r\nHere we have the Plant-louse at home, strictly isolated from the world.\r\nThough the edge of the fostering leaflet undergoes no alteration of\r\nshape or colour, the pitcher-shaped appendage at its base turns a pale\r\nyellow and grows larger day by day, thanks to the centrifugal expansion\r\nprovoked by the insect’s irritant sucker. The continual punctures of\r\nthe solitary Louse and presently of her offspring will enlarge it, by\r\nthe end of the summer, to the dimensions of a fair-sized plum.\r\n\r\nThe horn-shaped galls originate in an entire leaf, selected from among\r\nthe smallest. On the tops of the boughs there are sickly leaves, the\r\nlast achievements of an exhausted impulse. Scarcely unfolded and\r\ninnocent of green, the colour of health, they measure barely a fifth of\r\nan inch in length. It is on these vegetable trifles that the enormous\r\nhorn-shaped structures are based; and even so the leaf is not\r\ncompletely utilized, but only one of its lobes: in short, a speck, a\r\nmere nothing.\r\n\r\nExploited by the Plant-louse, this mere nothing acquires a peculiar\r\nenergy. In the first place, it welds itself to the tip of the twig and\r\nbecomes one with it, so that it lingers on the tree when the leaves\r\nfall and, with them, the other galls; next, it excites a flow of sap\r\ncomparable with that of the pumpkin-stalk nourishing its fruit. The\r\nvery small begets the huge. The gall is at first a pretty little horn,\r\nregular in shape and green all over. Open it. The interior is a\r\nmagnificent flesh-colour and soft as satin. For the moment, a solitary\r\nLouse, a black one, inhabits this attractive residence.\r\n\r\nThe five kinds of establishment have been founded, from the fold to the\r\nhorn; they have only to grow larger as their population increases. Now\r\nwhat are they doing, these Lice immured in solitary confinement, each\r\nafter her own fashion? To begin with, they are changing their clothes\r\nand their shape. They used to be black and slender, suitably built for\r\nwandering over the budding leaves: now they adopt sedentary habits,\r\nturn yellow and put on flesh. And now, with the sucker implanted on the\r\nwall, which is swollen with turpentine, they quietly give birth to\r\ntheir young. For them this is a continuous function, like that of\r\ndigestion. They have nothing else to do.\r\n\r\nShall we call them fathers? No: the word would clash with the\r\nexpression “giving birth.” Shall we speak of them as mothers? Not that\r\neither. The exact meaning of the word prevents us. They are neither one\r\nnor the other, nor are they an intermediate form. Our language has no\r\nterm to describe these animal curiosities. We must resort to the plants\r\nto acquire an approximate notion of the whole procedure.\r\n\r\nIn our parts, the common garlic scarcely ever flowers: cultivation has\r\ncaused it to lose its sexual duality. It knows nothing of true seed, to\r\nwhich the paternity of the stamen and the maternity of the pistil\r\ncontribute. Yet the plant multiplies readily enough. The underground\r\npart begets its offspring directly, that is to say, it produces large\r\nfleshy buds, gathered into a cluster of what is known as cloves. Each\r\nis a living embryo plant, which, when buried in the soil, continues its\r\ndevelopment and grows like the original plant. To multiply the garlic\r\nin his kitchen-garden, the gardener has no other resource than that of\r\nthe cloves, the usual seed being here non-existent.\r\n\r\nSome plants of the same alliaceous group are even more remarkable. They\r\nsend up a normal stem, ending in what appears to be a spherical head of\r\nblossom. Properly this head should blossom into an umbel of flowers.\r\nBut this is not what happens. There are no flowers whatever; they are\r\nreplaced by bulbils, a diminutive form of clove. Sexuality has\r\ndisappeared: instead of seeds, announced by the preparations for\r\nflowering, the plant produces plantlets, concentrated into fleshy buds.\r\nOn the other hand, the underground part has a lavish supply of cloves.\r\nThough the garlic is sexless, its future is assured; it will have no\r\nlack of successors.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent, the genesis of the Plant-louse will bear\r\ncomparison with that of the garlic. The strange insect also puts forth\r\nbulbils: that is to say, it is spared all ovarian delay and procreates\r\nlive offspring without assistance.\r\n\r\nThe male is nobler than the female, says Lhomond. [66] This is a\r\npedantic formula, generally refuted by natural history. In the animal\r\nkingdom, work, industry and ability, those true titles of nobility, are\r\nthe attributes of the mother. No matter: let us accept Lhomond’s\r\ndictum; and, since we are allowed the choice, let us speak of the\r\nPlant-louse as of the masculine gender, which is the nobler from the\r\ngrammarian’s point of view. For that matter, nothing shall prevent us\r\nspeaking of it as feminine, if our speech thereby gains in lucidity.\r\n\r\nIsolated in his cell, the original Plant-louse, we were saying, grows a\r\nnew skin and puts on flesh. He brings sons into the world, all of whose\r\nbeaks play their part in enlarging the gall, while all their bellies\r\nare engaged in increasing the population. We are reminded of the\r\navalanche which, at first a mere lump, becomes an enormous mass of\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\nWhen summer is over, in September, let us open a gall, no matter which,\r\nspread out the contents on a sheet of paper, take up a\r\nmagnifying-glass, and see what there is to see. Folds, spindles,\r\nauricles, globes and horns afford us almost the same spectacle,\r\nallowing for numbers, which are here restricted and there enormous. The\r\nLice are a magnificent orange yellow. The largest have stumps on their\r\nshoulders, the rudiments of wings to be.\r\n\r\nAll are clad in an exquisite cloak, whiter than snow, which projects\r\nsome distance behind them, like a train. This finery is a waxy fleece\r\nexuded by the skin. It will not bear the touch of a camel-hair brush; a\r\nbreath destroys it; but the Louse despoiled of it will soon sweat out\r\nanother. In the crowded gall, where so many individuals are huddled\r\ntogether, jostling one another, the waxen garment is often torn to\r\nshreds and pulverized. Hence a collection of floury rags, forming the\r\ndowniest of beds, in which the tribe lie about.\r\n\r\nMixed higgledy-piggledy with the orange Lice we see others, much less\r\nnumerous but easily detected. They are smaller, and are sometimes a\r\nrusty-red, sometimes a fairly bright vermilion. Always stocky and\r\nwrinkled, they are, according to the age and the pattern of the gall,\r\neither round as a Tortoise or shaped like a triangle with rounded\r\ncorners. On their backs, they carry six to eight rows of white tufts, a\r\nwaxy exudation, like the white smocks of the others. An attentive\r\nexamination with the magnifying-glass is needed to detect this detail\r\nof their costume. They never sport the wing-stumps which the others\r\nacquire sooner or later.\r\n\r\nOne last characteristic, more important than all the rest, places these\r\npigmies in a category completely by themselves. From time to time I see\r\non their backs a monstrous protuberance which mounts as high as the\r\nneck and doubles the creature’s bulk. Now this hump, which is here\r\nto-day and gone to-morrow, only to reappear later, is the conjurer’s\r\nwallet containing the future. When I manage to open one, without\r\nmishap, with the point of a needle, I extract from it a slimy speck\r\ndisplaying two black eye-spots, with traces of segmentation. My\r\nCæsarean operation has laid bare an embryo.\r\n\r\nI reserved the right to pass, grammatically, from the masculine to the\r\nfeminine gender. And this is the time to do so. I isolate a few of the\r\nhunch-backed squaws in a small glass tube, with a scrap of gall. They\r\ngive me young ones; and the humps disappear. The observation,\r\nunfortunately, cannot be continued: the scrap of gall withers and my\r\nspecimens die. None the less it is now established that these pigmy\r\nLice are mothers and that they carry knapsacks on their backs as\r\nincubating pockets.\r\n\r\nThe little red tortoises found in all the galls in the late summer are\r\ntherefore as prolific as the famous old woman who lived in a shoe: they\r\nalone bring forth young. All around them swarm their descendants, fat\r\norange babies, who deck themselves in snow-white furbelows, suck the\r\nsap, distend their stomachs and prepare to grow wings in view of an\r\napproaching migration.\r\n\r\nAre the hunch-backed mothers all the immediate daughters of the black\r\nLouse, the founder of the gall, or do they form a lineage at various\r\nremoves? The latter seems probable in the horn-shaped galls, where the\r\nmothers are so exceedingly numerous. A single origin would not account\r\nfor this prodigality. As for the other, far less thickly-populated\r\ngalls, it seems to me that a single generation of red Lice would be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\nLet me mention a few approximate figures. In the first week of\r\nSeptember I open a horn-shaped gall, selected from among the largest.\r\nIt measures eight inches in length by nearly an inch and a half in\r\nthickness at its greatest diameter. The population consists mainly of\r\norange Lice, plump, smooth, and endowed with wing-stumps. These are the\r\nprogeny of the tiny mothers. These latter are scarlet, stocky and\r\nwrinkled, with their fore-part tapering and their hinder-part as if it\r\nwere cut off short, so that their shape is almost triangular. As far as\r\nI can judge in the confusion of such a multitude, they should number\r\nsome hundreds.\r\n\r\nTo estimate the whole population, I pack it into a glass tube eighteen\r\nmillimetres [67] in diameter. The column thus formed occupies a height\r\nof 56 millimetres. [68] The volume, therefore, amounts to 16,532 cubic\r\nmillimetres. [69] Therefore, allowing one Louse, roughly, to each cubic\r\nmillimetre, the population of the gall is about sixteen thousand. As I\r\ncannot count, I gauge. Even so did Herschel [70] gauge the Milky Way.\r\nFor numerical infinity, the Louse vies with the star. In four months\r\nthe black atom, the first pioneer of the gall, has left all these\r\ndescendants; and the end is not yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE TEREBINTH-LOUSE: THE MIGRATION\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of September the horn-shaped gall is full, almost as full as\r\na keg of anchovies. There would not be room for them all were the Lice\r\nto form only one layer, side by side, with their suckers implanted.\r\nThey lie in strata according to the length of their probe: uppermost\r\nare the big Lice, in the second layer the medium-sized and between\r\ntheir legs the small ones, all of them motionless, with their trunks at\r\nwork. Above those engaged in drinking is the shifting horde, seeking a\r\nplace at the refreshment bar. Eddies occur in the crowd: those at the\r\ntop dive down, those underneath return to the surface; and this\r\ncontinual ebb and flow gives each one time for a little tippling.\r\n\r\nIn this rough and tumble the white waxen finery turns to flour, which\r\nfills up the interstices and makes of the whole a swarming conglomerate\r\nin which the metamorphosis is effected. Here, without a moment’s quiet,\r\nthe moult takes place and not a leg is out of joint: here, when there\r\nis no free space, wide wings are unfurled and not a wing is torn. To\r\nachieve transfiguration without a hitch in such a tumult the insect\r\nmust be peculiarly favoured by fortune.\r\n\r\nThe pot-bellied orange Lice are now handsome, black, slender midges,\r\nprovided with four wings. Their secluded life is over; the time has\r\ncome for soaring in the open air. But how will they get out? The\r\ninternees are quite incapable of making a breach in the ramparts: they\r\nhave no tools. Well, what the prisoners cannot accomplish the fortress\r\nitself will do. When the population is ripe the gall is ripe too, so\r\nclosely does the calendar of the bush synchronize with that of the\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nThe hems raise their upper folds a little; the spindles open like so\r\nmany purses, each lined with pink satin; the auricles part their thick\r\ngnarled lips. The doors open of themselves for the impatient inmates,\r\nby the mere action of the sap. In the other galls, the globular and\r\nhorn-shaped ones, the mechanism does not work so easily; the unclosing\r\nis a violent affair. More and more distended day by day, the globes\r\nburst their sides in star-shaped rents, while the horns split open at\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nThe exodus is worth close observation. I choose a few of the\r\nhorn-shaped galls whose cracked tips announces the coming rupture. I\r\nexpose them to the sun, in my study, facing a window, at a distance of\r\na few paces from the closed casements. In the intervening space I set\r\nup a thick branch of leafy terebinth. I reckon upon this bait to\r\nattract the flying Lice, at least as a resting-spot. Next morning one\r\nof the horns opens, and by midday, in radiant sunlight, in calm, hot\r\nweather, the winged Lice are emerging.\r\n\r\nThey come forth in small companies, without hurrying. It is a quiet,\r\ngently-flowing stream. They are dusted over with a waxy flour, all that\r\nremains of the sometime powder-puffs. When barely on the threshold of\r\nthe cranny, they spread their wings and are off, shedding a faint trail\r\nof dust from their shoulders, shaken by the vibrations of their wings.\r\nWith an undulating flight they all make straight for the window, where\r\nthe light is brighter than elsewhere. They dash against the panes and\r\nslip down upon the cross-bars. There, bathed in the sunlight, without\r\nattempting to go further afield, they remain, collecting in a drift.\r\n\r\nAlthough the rest of the room is thoroughly well lit in all directions,\r\nthe flight of the departing Lice is always directed towards the window\r\nfacing the sun. There are thousands upon thousands of them; and not one\r\ntakes another path, veering ever so little to the right or left. You\r\nfeel a certain surprise at the invariable route pursued by these atoms\r\nwhich, when released, in a space well lit on every side, all, from the\r\nfirst to the last, rush towards the delights of a ray of sunshine. A\r\nhandful of shot dropped from a height does not return to earth with\r\ngreater certainty. The leaden pellets are attracted by gravity, to\r\nwhich all dead matter is subject, while the specks of living matter\r\nobey the light.\r\n\r\nMy window-panes check them. In the absence of this obstacle, where\r\nwould they go? Certainly not to the terebinth-trees near by. I have\r\ndefinite proof of this here, before my eyes. As a resting-place I have\r\nset up a bough of the cherished bush. None of the newly emerged insects\r\ntakes notice of it; none of them pauses there. If on the way to the\r\nwindow one of them collides with the green thicket and falls upon a\r\nleaf, it quickly picks itself up again and makes off in a hurry to join\r\nthe others in the sunlit window. Freed henceforth from the demands of\r\nthe stomach, they are no longer interested in the terebinth; they all\r\navoid it.\r\n\r\nThe exodus lasts a couple of days. When the last loiterers have gone,\r\nlet us open the gall entirely. The population has been rigorously\r\nsorted. At first it was a mixture of wingless red and winged black\r\nLice. The latter have all left their dwelling; the others are still\r\nthere. Those faithful to their home are small as before, squat,\r\nwrinkled and vermilion. Some of them bear the dorsal wallet, the\r\nmaternal pouch. In them I recognize the legion of the mothers, now left\r\nalone in the house. For some time yet they linger on languidly, the\r\ngall being open to wind and weather; those less exhausted continue to\r\nproduce offspring; mere abortions without a future; the time is too\r\nshort and the house is falling into decay. At length they perish, with\r\ntheir belated young. The gall is a deserted ruin.\r\n\r\nLet us return to the emigrants, checked in their flight by the\r\nwindow-panes. In shape, colour and size they are all alike; the swarm\r\nis a monotonous repetition of the same individual; there is not one\r\ndetail, however minute, to denote any difference. Yet we should expect\r\nto find males and females here. The Plant-louse, until this moment in\r\nthe humble larval stage, has just acquired the attributes of the\r\nperfect insect. The heavy, pot-bellied Louse has become a slender\r\nmidge, glorified by four iridescent wings. In any other insect this\r\nwould be an infallible token of the nuptial frolics.\r\n\r\nWell, in the children of the galls, these wings, these adornments of\r\nmaturity, belie their promises. There is no wedding and there can be\r\nnone. Not a Louse in all the swarm is endowed with sex, and yet each\r\nhas her brood, which she brings into the world by direct reproduction\r\nas her predecessors did.\r\n\r\nWith a slip of straw moistened with saliva I pick up a winged Louse at\r\nrandom. I press its abdomen with a pin. My brutal obstetrics produces\r\nan immediate effect: the insect’s outraged flanks eject a string of\r\nfive or six fœtuses; and the process is repeated without variation no\r\nmatter what specimen we deliver.\r\n\r\nLet us, for that matter, consult the natural procedure. A couple of\r\nhours elapse and my prisoners behind the window are in the throes of\r\nchildbirth on the glass of the panes, the plaster of the embrasure, the\r\nwood of the cross-bars. Matters become so urgent that any place suits\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Louse in the act of parturition raises her two large wings, the\r\nupper pair, and gently moves the two small ones, the lower pair. The\r\ntip of the abdomen bends downwards, touches the supporting surface and\r\nthe thing is done: a fœtus is implanted perpendicularly to the support,\r\nwith its head uppermost. A little farther away, a second is deposited\r\nas promptly, followed by another and yet others. In one brief sitting\r\nthe distribution is over. The average number of the litter is six.\r\n\r\nThe infant, we were saying, is fixed in an upright position, at right\r\nangles to the supporting surface. This nicely-balanced attitude is\r\nnecessary. The new-born Louse is, in fact, wrapped in a thin tunic of\r\nwhich it must first of all divest itself. In a minute or two this\r\nswaddling band splits and is thrust backwards. The legs release\r\nthemselves, kicking freely in all directions, which they could not do\r\nwere the tiny creature lying on the ground. By this means joints that\r\nare working for the first time gain strength and suppleness. After a\r\nfew moments of these gymnastic exercises, the tiny insect drops on its\r\nfeet and wanders forth into the wide world.\r\n\r\nWhile it is struggling in an upright position, passers-by sometimes\r\nknock it over, without consideration for its tender age. Then the\r\ndanger is great. Thrown from its sticky pedestal, the little insect\r\noften perishes, incapable of casting off its slough. There are a few\r\nthreads of cobweb in the corner of the window. Some winged Lice have\r\nbeen caught in them. The garlands of hanging Lice give birth to their\r\noffspring all the same, but the young ones, falling on the sill of the\r\nembrasure, cannot manage to strip, because they are not in a standing\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nSoon the cross-bars of the window are peopled with vermin, jogging\r\nalong with great activity, promiscuously with the winged Lice. What a\r\nto-do on the borderland of the invisible! What are they seeking, these\r\nbusy atoms? What do they want? My ignorance will be their undoing. In\r\ntwo or three days the winged Lice die. Their part is played. That of\r\nthe children is beginning. For some time yet the latter wander about,\r\nbut at last nothing stirs at the window; the legion of Lice is dead.\r\nBefore sweeping them away with a camel’s-hair brush, let us give a\r\nbrief description of them. The new-born insects are pale green and\r\nslender in shape. Their length is not far short of a millimetre. [71]\r\nNimble and standing fairly high on their legs, they trot about busily.\r\n\r\nThe globular galls burst and the hems, auricles and spindles begin to\r\ngape a little earlier than the horn-shaped galls, about the middle of\r\nSeptember. The five gall-makers of the terebinth all have the same\r\ncustoms. After emerging from their open dwellings, all the adults, or\r\nwinged black Lice, give birth, within twenty-four hours, to a small\r\nnumber of young, some five or six, as do those of the horn-shaped\r\ngalls.\r\n\r\nThe auricles yield a dumpy Louse, wider behind than before and of a\r\ndark olive colour. Her most remarkable feature is her sucker, which,\r\nfolded underneath the insect, sticks out behind, recalling after a\r\nfashion a Grasshopper’s oviscapt. What can the puny creatures want with\r\nthis mechanism? It is a sword, a sabre. Held erect, the implement would\r\nprevent any attempt at walking. To drive it into the food-plant, the\r\ninsect apparently hoists itself on its legs, which correspond in length\r\nwith the enormous probe. I should like to see this inordinate beak at\r\nwork. My captives refuse what I give them: leaves and fresh galls. They\r\nlie huddled on the plug of cotton-wool which closes the tube. They have\r\nbusiness to attend to. They want to get away; but to what?\r\n\r\nLikewise squat of build, packed, not without a certain prettiness, into\r\nthe shape of miniature Toads, the Lice from the globular galls are a\r\npale yellowish brown, while those of the folded leaves are greenish\r\nblack. Neither the first nor the second have beaks of exaggerated\r\nlength. That extraordinary rostrum, which sticks out behind, and, when\r\nat rest, resembles a caudal appendage, recurs in the young Lice from\r\nthe spindle-shaped galls; but this time the little creature is oblong\r\nand its colour is pale green.\r\n\r\nLet us cut short these dry details. It is enough if we recognize that\r\nthese five fellow-guests of the terebinth are not of one race following\r\ndifferent trades, but separate species. If the earlier generations,\r\nwhich all resemble one another, seemed to bear witness to a specific\r\nunity, the family of the winged Lice testifies to the contrary. These\r\nthickset insects and these slender ones; these bearers of the rostrum,\r\nsometimes of normal length and sometimes fantastically prolonged into\r\nthe semblance of a caudal beak; these pale-green, olive-green,\r\nlight-yellow insects are obviously independent forms.\r\n\r\nA meticulous examination might find here preeminently all the\r\ncharacteristic features of the five categories; but the reader,\r\nrepelled by prose descriptions, would soon turn the page. Let us pass\r\non. Let us leave the insect laboratory, with its jars and test-tubes;\r\nlet us go out of doors to see how matters come to pass under natural\r\nconditions on the terebinth in the grounds.\r\n\r\nThe galls, frequently inspected during the hottest hours of the day,\r\nopen before my eyes; the horns are splitting at the top, the globes are\r\nopening their sides, the others are parting their lips. The moment the\r\nfissure is wide enough the black emigrants appear, without haste, one\r\nby one, in absolute composure, despite the fierceness of the sun. The\r\nexodus was not accomplished with greater sobriety in the comparative\r\ndarkness of my study. For a few seconds they linger in the breach;\r\nthen, shedding a dusty trail from their floury backs, they spread their\r\nwings and are off. Their flight, favoured by the least breath of air,\r\npromptly carries them to a distance at which I soon lose sight of them.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the exodus is partial, being distributed over several days.\r\nWhen the whole swarm has disappeared there are still the wingless red\r\nLice, the hump-backed pigmies, the progenitors of the big migrants.\r\nSome of them come to enjoy a little sunlight on the brink of the\r\naperture. They soon go in again. Others follow them; perhaps they too\r\nare attracted by the brilliant sunshine. Then we see none at all. The\r\nfestival of the light is not for them. For a week or two longer they\r\nlead a hand-to-mouth existence in the ruined gall, but their end is not\r\nfar off. The withered gall starves them and old age kills them where\r\nthey stand.\r\n\r\nSo far there is nothing new: my laboratory experiments have already\r\nshown me what the terebinth in the garden tells me. The window-panes\r\nand test-tubes have even taught me more than the tree: they have\r\nenabled me to realize the part played by the winged Lice. In the\r\nliberty of the open air one fundamental detail of their story escapes\r\nme, for parturition takes place at a distance, I do not know where. The\r\nnew-born Lice must be scattered everywhere, often at a considerable\r\ndistance, as the emigrant’s flight informs me. Shall I then not find on\r\nthe tree itself the little Lice with which my indoor observations have\r\nmade me familiar? Yes: and in circumstances which are worth recording.\r\n\r\nLet me recapitulate: to escape from their galls, strongly-built\r\ndungeons without any outlet, the Terebinth-Lice have no means of\r\nbreaking through. Though very clever at tickling vegetable tissues and\r\nmaking them swell into excrescences, they can do nothing with the walls\r\nof their prison. When it is time to go, however impatient they may be\r\nto get out, they must wait until the gall opens of itself, until the\r\nhorn, in particular, splits into jagged segments at the top and the\r\nglobe bursts open at the side. Until the fort is thus spontaneously\r\ndismantled, there is no possibility of escape.\r\n\r\nNow it may happen that the winged population is ripe and ready to\r\nincrease and multiply before there is a breach in the wall, either\r\nbecause the gall is not yet sufficiently distended, or because it has\r\ndried up before its time and is henceforth unable to open.\r\n\r\nWhat do the captives do in the event of such a disaster? Precisely what\r\nthey would do in the open air. Their business cannot be postponed. When\r\nthe imperious hour has struck they bring forth their young, one on top\r\nof another, in such a crush that it is hardly possible to move. For\r\ngood, or ill, the great task is accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn this tangle of wings a-flutter in the midst of a waxy powder, this\r\nskirmish of legs seeking equilibrium on an ever-shifting support, many\r\nyoung Lice are trampled underfoot and injured, many are unable to strip\r\nand shrivel into grains of dust. The majority, none the less, so\r\ntenacious of life are they, contrive to escape in the swarming\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nLet us, in October, open a globular or horn-shaped gall which has dried\r\nup without bursting. We shall find it crammed with black Lice, all\r\nwinged and all dead; a mass of procreators who have died after\r\nparturition. Beneath the heap of corpses, more especially against the\r\nwalls of the dwelling, the lens, in amazement, discovers thousands of\r\nyoung ones. This is a new people: it is the future struggling amidst\r\nthe cadaveric relics of the past; it is the progeny of the winged Lice,\r\nthe family born in prison. Here and there, in the midst of this\r\nbustling youth, are vermilion-coloured specks, more awkward in their\r\ngait but as lively as the rest. These are the grandmothers of the\r\ncolony, still doing fairly well and capable, I should say, of surviving\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\nI have some hope of keeping them alive, they look so healthy. Perhaps\r\ntheir part is not yet fully played. I set them aside, together with\r\ntheir galls, opened with a penknife. If left to the inclemencies of the\r\nweather in their ruined cells, they would die when the cold sets in;\r\nbut may they not hold out if sheltered under glass? I almost think they\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed at the outset things do not go so badly. My little red\r\ninsects continue to look in the best of health. Then, at the first\r\nfrosts, they become motionless, though still fresh in appearance as\r\nthough they meant to return to life in the spring. Appearances deceive;\r\nthe motionless Lice never move again. Long before April the whole herd\r\nis dead. My care has slightly delayed the dissolution, without\r\npreventing the inevitable end. None the less I marvel at the tenacious\r\nvitality of the little red grandmothers. They live half the year, their\r\ndaughters but a few days.\r\n\r\nReleased henceforward from the necessity of feeding themselves, the\r\nblack emigrants, the winged Lice, leave their terebinth and need not\r\nsearch for another, as is proved by my bough, which, placed in the path\r\nof the emerging insects, does not even serve them as a temporary\r\nresting-place. They seem equally heedless in selecting a spot for the\r\nestablishment of their family. Before my window the young Lice are\r\ndropped at random, at any point to which the hazards of flight have\r\nled: on the window-panes, the plaster of the embrasure, the wood of the\r\ncross-bars or the threads of cobweb indifferently. There is nothing to\r\nshow that the unfamiliar spot is regarded as inopportune. There is no\r\nsign of uneasiness, no attempt to fly off elsewhither, to a more\r\npropitious place. Soberly and serenely, the winged legion brings forth\r\nits young and goes its way.\r\n\r\nIn the open country things must happen no otherwise. The moment they\r\nare free, the emigrants shake off their waxen dust and flit away in\r\nthis direction or in that, according to the prevailing breeze. A\r\nflying-machine has sprouted from their shoulders, a remarkable contrast\r\nto the clumsy paunch of their early days. Quick, for the sunlight, for\r\nflight, for the joys of the ballet in mid-air! Off they go, hovering as\r\nlong as their feeble wings allow; then, wearied of merry-making in the\r\nsun, they alight on the first object that offers, without henceforth\r\nrenewing their flight as do my prisoners behind the closed window.\r\nHere, no matter what the nature of the site, parturition takes place.\r\nThere is nothing left for them but to die.\r\n\r\nWith these urgent methods, disdainful of deliberate selection, the\r\nwastage among the emigrants’ tiny offspring must be great. On the bare\r\nsoil, on stones, on dry bark, the little Lice undoubtedly perish. They\r\nneed food quickly; and they are scarcely capable of wandering in quest\r\nof it themselves. Their sucker, sometimes of inordinate length,\r\nprojecting beyond the tip of the abdomen like a caudal rapier, demands\r\nthat the wearer shall erect it, shall drive it into some yielding\r\nsource of sap. The insect must drink or die. In the test-tubes wherein\r\nI collect the young Lice born before my eyes, my captives die in less\r\nthan a fortnight from want of food.\r\n\r\nI try various kinds of green stuff. I have no success with any of them.\r\nBut here, if direct observation fails me, logic comes to my assistance.\r\nThere is no doubt that the tiny Lice, at the present moment the sole\r\nrepresentatives of their race, must live through the winter and serve\r\nas the origin of the population which will occupy the terebinth in the\r\nspring. These puny creatures cannot remain exposed to the severities of\r\nthe winter. A shelter is indispensable, a shelter that will afford them\r\nboth food and lodging. Where will they find it? Only one shelter is\r\npossible: it must be underground, beneath some sort of grass that will\r\nretain a little green in winter.\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, to be presumed that the thick tufts of certain grasses\r\nwill afford them shelter. This abiding-place, where the sucker will\r\nsink into the sweet root-fibres, and where the drip of rain or snow\r\ndoes not easily find access, is beloved by several Plant-lice. Those of\r\nthe terebinth also may very well take up their winter-quarters there.\r\nAs for what happens in these subterranean lairs, we are reduced to more\r\nor less probable conjectures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE DORTHESIA\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the exodus of the young, when she deserts her tent of swansdown,\r\nhalf a finger’s-breadth in thickness, very warm and soft, but blocked\r\nwith rubbish which would hamper a second family, the Clotho Spider [72]\r\nproceeds to fashion elsewhere a light hammock with a canopy, an\r\ninexpensive summer-house where she will pass the remainder of the warm\r\nweather. Those who are not yet marriageable ask no better protection\r\nagainst the inclemencies of the winter; their robust powers of\r\nendurance are satisfied with a muslin tent under the shelter of a\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nThe matrons, on the other hand, as the heat begins to decrease, hasten\r\nto enlarge and strengthen their cells, lavishing upon them the contents\r\nof their silk-reservoirs, which the hunting-expeditions of the fine\r\nsummer nights have left distended. When the sharp white-frosts set in\r\nthey will doubtless find more comfort in their luxurious mansions than\r\nin the first rickety hovels; nevertheless, they do not build them\r\nprecisely for themselves but rather for the use of their expected\r\noffspring; wherefore the walls are never stout nor the feather-beds\r\ndowny enough.\r\n\r\nThe superb structure of the Clotho is above all a nest, beside which\r\nthose of the Chaffinch and the Siskin are but squatter’s huts. The\r\nmother, it is true, does not sit upon her eggs, being as she is without\r\nan incubator; she does not feed her offspring, who for that matter do\r\nnot require her assistance; but the part which she plays is, none the\r\nless, one of exquisite tenderness. For seven or eight months she\r\nwatches over her brood, protecting it with a devotion equal to that of\r\nthe bird, or even greater.\r\n\r\nMaternity, the supreme inspiration of the noblest instincts, has\r\nthousands upon thousands of masterpieces to bear witness to its skill.\r\nLet us recall that of the Labyrinth Spider. [73] What a wonderful\r\nachievement is the spacious building where the mother mounts guard\r\nabout the star-shaped tabernacle, the family cradle! What an eminently\r\nlogical stronghold is this rampart of silk reinforced by masonry, to\r\nprotect the eggs from the probe of the Ichneumon-fly!\r\n\r\nSimilarly, each mother has her own defensive methods, which are\r\nsometimes the most ingenious inventions and sometimes devices of\r\nextreme simplicity. The strange thing is that the distribution of\r\ntalents takes no account whatever of the insect hierarchy. Certain\r\ninsects of the highest rank, protected by sumptuous wing-cases, or\r\nsporting lofty plumes, or attired in garments of imbricated gold\r\nscales, are almost or quite incapable of doing anything; they are\r\nmagnificent duffers, whereas others, among the very humblest, and\r\npassing unperceived, amaze us by their talents when we grant them our\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nBut do not things happen likewise amongst ourselves? True merit shuns\r\nindolent luxury. If we are to turn to the best advantage the little\r\ngood which may lie hidden within us, we must feel the incentive of\r\nneed. As long as nineteen centuries ago, Persius prefaced his satires\r\nwith the lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Magister artis ingenique largitor Venter.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of our proverbs repeats his views in terms a little less crude:\r\n\r\n\r\n    L’homme est comme la nèfle; il n’est rien qui vaille\r\n    S’il n’amûri longtemps au grenier, sur la paille. [74]\r\n\r\n\r\nInsects are like ourselves. Necessity stimulates their wits and at\r\ntimes enables them to make discoveries which upset all our conceptions.\r\nI know of one, amongst the humblest and least well-known, which, to\r\nsafeguard its progeny, has found the following strange solution of the\r\nproblem: at the laying-season, the normal length of the body is\r\ntrebled: the fore part is left at the service of the insect, which\r\nfeeds, digests, roams about and shares in the joys of the sunlight; and\r\nthe hinder part becomes an infant’s crêche, a nursery in which the\r\nlittle ones are gently exercised.\r\n\r\nThis singular creature is called the Dorthesia (D. Characias, Latt). We\r\nfind it from time to time on the Greater Spurge, which the Greeks used\r\nto call Characias and which the Provençal peasant of to-day calls\r\nChusclo, Lachusclo.\r\n\r\nA lover of the climate in which the olive flourishes, this spurge\r\nabounds on the Sérignan hills, in the driest spots, where its great\r\nblue-green tufts contrast with the poverty-stricken vegetation of the\r\nneighbourhood. Standing in a bed of pebbles which reflect the sun’s\r\nrays upon it, by its vigorous foliage it protests against the hardships\r\nof winter. Still, it is not devoid of prudence. When the foolish\r\nalmond-tree is already abandoning its shivering petals to the\r\nnorth-east wind, the spurge, less hasty, continues to observe the\r\nweather and keeps the tender tips of its blossoms rolled up\r\ncrosier-wise for protection. The worst frosts are over. Then, with a\r\nsudden urge of sap, the stems swell with a milk that burns like hot\r\ncoals and the crosiers uncurl and straighten out into clusters of dingy\r\nlittle flowers, at which the first Gnats of the year come to slake\r\ntheir thirst.\r\n\r\nWait a few days longer. As the weather grows milder, we shall see a\r\nnumerous population slowly emerging from the heap of leaves that have\r\nfallen at the foot of the spurge. It is the Dorthesia quitting her\r\nwinter quarters under the remnants of the old foliage, and climbing,\r\ngradually, by cautious stages, from the base to the topmost summits of\r\nthe plant, where the joys of heat and radiant light await her, together\r\nwith the delights of an inexhaustible feeding-bottle.\r\n\r\nIn April, or at latest in May, the ascent is completed; all the little\r\ncreatures are assembled on the topmost tips of the branches, in\r\nclose-packed groups, side touching side, after the fashion of the\r\nPlant-lice. A sap-drinker and endowed with a beak that acts as a\r\ngimlet, the Dorthesia is, in fact, related to the Aphides, whose\r\nsedentary and social habits she shares; but, far from reminding us in\r\nappearance of the plump, naked vermin which the rose-tree and so many\r\nother plants have made familiar to us, she is clothed, and her costume\r\nis one of unusual elegance.\r\n\r\nThe orange Terebinth-lice, imprisoned in galls, whether horn-shaped or\r\nrounded like apricots, attach to their hinder parts a long train of\r\nextreme delicacy, which the slightest touch reduces to dust. In the\r\nDorthesiæ, on the other hand, we see a complete garment, a\r\nclose-fitting coat of indefinite length, though fragile and breaking\r\noff in particles under the point of a needle, just as a brittle rind\r\nmight do.\r\n\r\nNothing could be prettier than the cloak of this large Louse, either in\r\nshape or in colour. It is a uniform dead white, more pleasing to the\r\neye than even the white of milk. The forepart of the garment is a\r\njacket of curly knots arranged in four longitudinal rows between which\r\nother, smaller knots are distributed. The hinder part is a fringe of\r\nten slats gradually increasing in width and spreading outwards, not\r\nunlike the teeth of a comb. The breast is covered by a shirt-front\r\nformed of symmetrical plates and pierced with six neatly-rounded holes,\r\nthrough which the brown legs emerge, quite naked and unconstrained.\r\nThis shirt-front and the curly mantle on the back together form a sort\r\nof sleeveless woollen waistcoat with easy-fitting armholes. In the same\r\nway the hood is pierced by holes to give free play to the rostrum and\r\nthe antennæ. All the other parts are covered by the white cloak.\r\n\r\nThis is the winter costume; it covers the whole body but does not\r\nextend beyond it. Later, when the laying-season draws near, the garment\r\ngrows longer, as though the insect, which in reality cannot undergo\r\nfurther change, were growing at a furious rate and trebling its length.\r\nGracefully curved like the prow of a gondola, the new portion is\r\nfurrowed above by wide parallel grooves; underneath it is finely\r\nstreaked, almost smooth. The end is cut off square. The\r\nmagnifying-glass here reveals a transverse button-hole plugged with\r\nfine cotton-wool.\r\n\r\nThe material of the garment is everywhere brittle, fusible and\r\ninflammable; when laid on paper it leaves a slightly translucent mark.\r\nFrom these qualities we judge it to be a sort of wax, similar to\r\nbeeswax. In order to obtain it in some other form than that of tiny\r\nparticles removed from the insect, I collect a handful of Dorthesiæ and\r\nsubject them to the action of boiling water. The waxen coverings melt\r\nand dissolve into an oily liquid which floats on the surface; the\r\ndenuded insects sink to the bottom. On cooling, the thin floating layer\r\nsets into an amber-yellow sheet.\r\n\r\nThis colour causes us a certain surprise. We began with a substance\r\nwhose whiteness rivalled that of milk; and now melting gives it a look\r\nof resin. This is a matter of molecular arrangement and nothing more.\r\nTo impart a proper whiteness to the yellow wax as it comes from the\r\nhive, the wax-chandler melts it down and pours the melted substance\r\ninto cold water, thereby reducing it to thin flakes which he afterwards\r\nexposes, on wattled screens, to the rays of the sun. Further meltings\r\nfollow, with a further production of shell-like flakes and further\r\nexposure to the bright sunshine; and, little by little, the wax turns\r\nwhite by changing its molecular structure. In this art of bleaching how\r\nfar our superior is the Dorthesia! Without treating the material by\r\nrepeated meltings and prolonged exposures to the sun, she then and\r\nthere transforms a yellow wax into one of incomparable whiteness. She\r\nobtains by her gentle methods a result that eludes the violent\r\nprocedures of the laboratory.\r\n\r\nLike beeswax, the Dorthesia’s wax is not collected in the outer world:\r\nit is a first product, exuded through the surface of the body. No\r\nmanipulation is required to induce it to form itself into curly knots,\r\nto fall into uniform streaks or graceful flutings. Merely in exuding\r\nfrom the pores of the skin, it automatically acquires the requisite\r\nform; like the fledgling’s plumage, its clothing grows correctly by the\r\nmere activities of the organism; the wearer of the dress has no need to\r\nimprove upon it.\r\n\r\nThe tiny creature, when it issues from the egg, is perfectly naked, and\r\nbrown in colour. Soon, before leaving the mother and settling on the\r\nbark of the spurge to draw its first sips, it becomes covered with\r\nthinly-scattered white specks, which form the first outline of the\r\nfuture jacket. By slow degrees these specks increase in number and are\r\nproduced into curly knots, so much so that the youngster, at the moment\r\nof its emancipation, is clad like its elders.\r\n\r\nThe exudation of the wax is continuous; the white tunic is constantly\r\ngrowing larger and nearer to perfection. Therefore the insect, if I\r\ncunningly strip it bare, ought to be capable of clothing itself anew.\r\nExperiment confirms my expectations. Destroying her garments with the\r\npoint of a needle and brushing them off with a camel-hair pencil, I\r\ncompletely denude a mature Dorthesia. The persecuted Louse comes forth\r\nin her poor brown skin. I isolate her on a sprig of spurge. In two or\r\nthree weeks’ time the coat has been remade; not so full as the first,\r\nbut large enough and of the regulation cut. With the wax which would\r\nhave added to the original garment the insect has sweated forth\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nWhat is the use of this backward prolongation which trebles the actual\r\nsize of the body? Is it merely an adornment? It is much more than that.\r\n\r\nLet us, once April is here, detach and lay open this strange appendage.\r\nIt is hollow, and full of an incomparable downy wadding; no feather-bed\r\nor eider-down could boast of so fine, so white a filling. In the midst\r\nof this magnificent eider-down some ovoid beads are scattered, some\r\nwhite and others tinged with a ruddy brown. These are the eggs. The\r\nnew-born insects are swarming amongst them, higgledy-piggledy; some are\r\nbare and brown, some are more or less speckled with white, according to\r\nthe more or less advanced state of the coat.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, let us watch the Dorthesia idly roaming about the\r\nspurge. At long intervals we shall see emerging from the orifice at the\r\nend of the padded pocket a young Louse, handsomely clad, and nimble in\r\nhis movements, who chooses his place beside his mother and settles\r\ndown, plunging his bill into the juicy bark. He will not stir again\r\nuntil the well is dry. Others follow him from day to day; and this goes\r\non for months on end!\r\n\r\nIf we were guided only by these observations we should conclude that\r\nthe mother was viviparous, given to dropping, here and there, living\r\noffspring, all ready dressed. Nothing of the kind: we have just found\r\nin the thickly-quilted pocket both eggs and young. Moreover, the laying\r\nand hatching of the eggs may be witnessed without difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn a glass tube provided with a sprig of spurge I segregate a few\r\nmothers whose terminal wallet I have removed. Laid bare, the insect’s\r\nhind-quarters have no further secrets from us; I see, sprouting from\r\nthem, a sort of white mildew, like an unshaven beard. This is the waxy\r\nsecretion that sprouts from the insect’s hind-quarters, producing,\r\ninstead of tassels, filaments of extreme fineness. It is thus that the\r\ndown which fills the wallet must be produced. Presently, in the midst\r\nof this tuft of down, an egg appears, like those which we obtained by\r\nbreaking into the maternal treasury.\r\n\r\nThis method enables me to estimate the size of the clutch. Two\r\nDorthesiæ stripped bare behind and isolated, with provisions, in a\r\nglass tube, produced, in thirteen days, thirty eggs, or fifteen apiece,\r\nor rather more than one egg daily. As the process of laying continues\r\nfor nearly five months, the total number of eggs for a single mother\r\nmust be nearly two hundred.\r\n\r\nThe eggs hatch in three or four weeks’ time. The hatching is announced\r\nby a change in the colour of the egg, which from white becomes a bright\r\nreddish-brown. On leaving the egg-shell the infant Louse is\r\nreddish-brown and absolutely naked. Its appearance is that of a very\r\ntiny Spider, the more so as its long antennæ look very like a fourth\r\npair of legs. Before long, four longitudinal rows of tiny white tufts\r\nappear on its back, with bare spaces between them. This is the\r\nbeginning of the waxen mantle.\r\n\r\nThe protracted period of egg-laying, which continues for four months or\r\nmore, the comparatively quick hatching, and, finally, the gradual\r\nexudation of the Louse’s clothing, explain why white eggs and\r\nreddish-brown eggs, with naked youngsters and others more or less\r\nclothed, are found simultaneously in the maternal pouch. This pouch is\r\na warehouse in which the Louse’s eggs are collected for months\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nInside the pouch, in the depths of its luxurious padding, the young\r\nLice are born, grow up, and clothe themselves in wax before risking the\r\ndangers of the open. The mother gently carries them from twig to twig\r\nof the spurge without troubling herself as to those that emerge from\r\nher pouch. One by one, as they feel themselves strong enough, they\r\nmigrate, when their time has come, to settle down in the neighbourhood.\r\nThe exit from their home is always open; they have only to force their\r\nway through the barrier of down.\r\n\r\nThe Narbonne Lycosa carries her family about with much less tenderness\r\nand security. There is no shelter on the back of the Gipsy Spider, no\r\nsafeguard against falls, which are frequent in such a scramble. The\r\nDorthesia, more happily inspired, makes a box of the skirts of her\r\nmantle and a downy bed of her caudal tufts. To find an equivalent\r\nmethod we must go back from the Spurge-louse to the first-born of the\r\nMammifers—Kangaroos, Opossums and others—who rear their young in a\r\npouch formed by a fold of the skin of the abdomen. Coming before its\r\ntime, the shapeless embryo fixes itself on the teat and completes its\r\ndevelopment in the maternal pouch or marsupium.\r\n\r\nLet us make use of this term to denote the Dorthesia’s pouch. There is\r\na great similarity between the two wallets, although the insect is\r\nsuperior to the mammal in this respect: Life often begins with\r\nexcellence in the lowly and ends with mediocrity in the strong. In the\r\noriginal device of the marsupium a Louse has done better than the\r\nOpossum.\r\n\r\nWith the object of following the history of my insects more\r\nconveniently than was possible under the blaze of the sun by the\r\nroadside, I placed before one of my study windows a fine clump of\r\nspurge transplanted into a capacious flowerpot. As a result of my\r\ndiligence the plant was populated during the course of March by three\r\nor four dozen Dorthesiæ, all wearing more or less fully developed\r\nmarsupia. My experiment in the domestication of plant and insect was\r\nextremely successful: the spurge did well, so its inhabitants prospered\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nThe wallets became filled with eggs and then with young Lice, who,\r\nmatured in the nick of time, and more numerous every day, emerged and\r\nspread themselves at will over the spurge. During the heat of the\r\nsummer you might have thought it had snowed on the plant, so populous\r\nwas the colony of white Lice. It contained thousands of new\r\ninhabitants, varying in size and easily distinguished from the mothers\r\nand foundresses by their smaller dimensions, but above all by the\r\ncomplete absence of the marsupium, an addition which must develop very\r\nmuch later, after hibernation at the root of the food-plant.\r\n\r\nSome are larger and others smaller, according to age, for the matrons\r\nstill continue to procreate, but all wear the same costume and present\r\nthe same appearance; yet certain differences, unnoticed at the time of\r\nmy summary examination, should divide them into two groups, one very\r\nsmall, consisting almost wholly of exceptions, and the other forming\r\nthe vast majority.\r\n\r\nIn August these differences become very plainly visible. On the tips of\r\nthe leaves, here and there, are isolated a few Lice who are surrounding\r\nthemselves with a fragile waxen enclosure, a sort of shapeless capsule,\r\nwhile the rest of the flock, nearly all, in fact, continue to drink,\r\ntheir bills plunged into the bark. Who are these solitaries, withdrawn\r\nfrom the world of drinkers? They are males, undergoing transformation.\r\nI open some of these fragile capsules. In the centre, on a downy bed\r\nlike that which fills the wallets of the mothers, lies a nymph endowed\r\nwith wing-stumps. At the beginning of September I obtain the first\r\nmales in their perfect state.\r\n\r\nStrange creatures, in truth! Standing high on their legs, with long\r\nhorns, they have the look of certain Bugs. The body is black and\r\npowdered with a fine waxy powder, the remains of the capsule in which\r\nthe transformation took place. The wings are of a leaden grey, rounded\r\nat the tips, overlapping one another when at rest and protruding a long\r\nway beyond the extremity of the abdomen. To the rear is an aigrette of\r\nwhite filaments, very long and straight, composed, no doubt, of wax,\r\nlike the cloak of the larval stage. It is a very fragile ornament: the\r\ninsect loses most of it merely in wandering about among the few leaves\r\nin his glass prison, the tube in which I am observing him.\r\n\r\nIn moments of elation the tip of the abdomen rises between the lifted\r\nwings and the bundle of spokes spreads out fanwise. The insect is\r\nshowing off, erecting his tail, like the peacock. To glorify his\r\nnuptials, he has attached a comet’s tail to his rump; he displays it\r\nfanwise, closes it, opens it again, making it quiver and glisten in the\r\nsunlight. When the crisis of joy has passed his finery is folded up and\r\nthe abdomen sinks down under cover of the wings.\r\n\r\nThe head is small, with long antennæ. At the tip of the abdomen is a\r\nshort, pointed projection, a sort of hook, an implement of pairing. Of\r\nmouth-parts or rostrum there is absolutely not a trace. What would he\r\ndo with them, this microcephalous coxcomb? He has changed his shape\r\nonly to flirt for a moment with his neighbours of the other sex, to\r\nmate and to die. Moreover, the part which he fulfils does not seem to\r\nbe particularly necessary. On the spurge in my study the female\r\npopulation of the second generation numbers several thousands, and I\r\nobtain, in all, some thirty males. Approximately, there are a hundred\r\ntimes as many females. The dandified wearers of the aigrette cannot\r\nsuffice for such a harem.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, they do not seem to be very eager. I see some who,\r\non emerging from the ruins of their capsule, covered with powder, brush\r\nand wipe themselves a little, try their wings, and then, with a lazy\r\nflight, make for the window, which is closed to prevent their escape.\r\nThe festival of the sunlight is to them a greater attraction than the\r\nemotions of pairing. It is possible that the indifferent lighting of\r\nthe room is in this case the cause of their coldness. In the open\r\ncountry, under the direct rays of the sun, they would certainly have\r\ndisplayed their finery amidst the marriageable females, and the\r\nbusiness of pairing would not have lacked ardour. But even though the\r\nmost favourable circumstances had conditioned the pairing, the\r\nexaggerated number of females, out of all proportion to the males,\r\ntells us that very few are chosen among many that are called: roughly\r\nabout one in a hundred. Nevertheless, all produce offspring. With these\r\nsingular creatures it is enough that a few mothers are fecundated from\r\ntime to time, and the race continues to thrive. The impulse\r\ncommunicated to the elect is a heritage which is handed down for some\r\nconsiderable time, on condition that a few couples, year by year,\r\nrestore to the community its exhausted energies.\r\n\r\nA parasite frequently observed in Bee-hives, the Monodontomerus, has\r\nalready shown us a similar example of the rarity of the males. Two tiny\r\nlittle creatures tell us of a vast field yet to be tilled by our\r\ngenetic theories. One day, perhaps, they will help us to unravel the\r\nobscure problem of the sexes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the old mothers, the Dorthesiæ bearing the marsupium, grow\r\nday by day fewer on the spurge. Their ovaries exhausted and their\r\nwallets empty, they fall to the ground, where the Ants cut them to\r\npieces. On the plant only those young mothers whose maternal pouches\r\nwill not begin to make an appearance until the return of spring are\r\nvisible nearly till Christmas. When the cold becomes severe the flock\r\ndescends to the foot of the spurge, under the heap of dead leaves. They\r\nwill come up again at the end of March, slowly climbing the\r\nspurge-plant, to acquire the rearing-pouch and begin once again the\r\ncycle of evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE KERMES OF THE OAK [75]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nest, that notable expression of maternal skill and care, is\r\nrivalled by other modes of rearing which often reveal the most\r\nwonderful tenderness. The Lycosa drags behind her, hanging to her\r\nspinnerets, the wallet of eggs that bangs against her legs; and for\r\nhalf the year she carries about on her back her young, fore-gathered in\r\na serried group. In like fashion does the Scorpion nurse her offspring\r\non her back; for a fortnight she allows them to gather strength against\r\nthe moment of emancipation. Exuding a white wax, the Dorthesia\r\ncontrives at the tip of the abdomen an exquisite muff into which the\r\nyoung are born, and in which they adorn themselves with cottony tufts\r\nand peacefully grow ripe for the exodus. The downy refuge, with its\r\nnarrow opening, allows the secluded offspring to emerge, one by one, as\r\nthey become capable of settling down upon the fostering spurge.\r\n\r\nLowly among the lowliest, the Kermes of the oak has invented something\r\neven better: the mother, transformed into an unassailable fortress,\r\nbequeaths to her family, as its cradle, her skin, toughened into an\r\nebony bastion.\r\n\r\nIn May let us patiently examine, in sunny corners, the slender twigs of\r\nthe holm-oak or evergreen oak. Let us also inspect that cross-grained\r\nshrub with small prickly leaves, known to the Provençal peasant as the\r\navaus, and to botanists as the kermes oak. This wretched brushwood,\r\nwhich one can pass over in a single stride, is really an oak, a genuine\r\noak, as is proved by its handsome acorns, set in their rough, prickly\r\ncups. We will gather our harvest here as well as on the holm-oak. But\r\nwe shall pass by the ordinary or English oak; we should find on it\r\nnothing in the least like what we are seeking to-day. Only the two\r\nspecies first mentioned will repay exploration.\r\n\r\nOn these we shall see, a few here and a few there, but never in\r\nabundance, certain globules of a glossy black, about the bigness of a\r\nmoderate-sized pea. Here we have the Kermes, one of the strangest of\r\ninsects. But is this an insect? Is it of the animal kingdom? The\r\nuninitiated would never suspect such a thing; he would take the object\r\nfor a berry, some species of black current. The mistake is all the more\r\nnatural in that the globule, if bitten into, cracks, and yields a\r\nsweetish flavour, offset by a slight bitterness.\r\n\r\nAnd this all but delicious fruit, we are told, is of the animal\r\nkingdom; it is an insect. Let us look at the creature closely, through\r\nthe pocket microscope. We look for a head, an abdomen, and legs. There\r\nis absolutely not a vestige of a head, nor of an abdomen, nor of legs;\r\nall there is to be seen is a sort of large bead, fit for that cheap\r\njewellery which is made of jet. Is there not at least that division\r\ninto segments, which is the documentary proof of the insect? No! A\r\npebble is not more lifeless.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we shall find on the under surface of the globule, in the part\r\nin contact with the twig, some trace of animal structure? The bead\r\ncomes away easily and without breaking, like a berry. The base is\r\nslightly flattened and powdered with a white waxy substance which acts\r\nas a cement and causes the bead to adhere to the twig. Soaked in\r\nalcohol for twenty-four hours this substance dissolves and leaves\r\nuncovered the part to be examined.\r\n\r\nCareful examination with the lens fails to reveal on the base of the\r\nbead the legs, or claws, however minute, which would serve to establish\r\nthe fact of animal life. Nor does it reveal the sucker which, implanted\r\nin the bark, would imbibe the sap, that indispensable aliment. Although\r\nless smooth than the back, this portion is as bare as the rest. One\r\nwould say, in fact, that the Kermes adheres to the twig because it is\r\ncemented to it, but has no other connection with it.\r\n\r\nThis cannot be the case. The black bead feeds itself; it grows; and\r\nwithout cessation it pours forth a product which might be the work of\r\nthe distiller. To make up for such expenditure it must at least possess\r\na rostrum to perforate the juicy bark. It assuredly does possess such\r\nan organ, but so small that my worn eyes are powerless to detect it.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment of detaching the Kermes from its support the\r\nimplement of suction may possibly withdraw itself, shrinking into\r\nitself to the point of becoming invisible.\r\n\r\nIn that half of the sphere which lies toward the base of the twig, the\r\nglobule is traversed by a wide furrow which occupies the greater part\r\nof the half-meridian. At the lower edge of this furrow, on the confines\r\nof the supporting base, is a narrow opening, in the shape of a\r\nbutton-hole. By this opening only is the Kermes in touch with the outer\r\nworld. It is a gate which serves many functions, and first of all, that\r\nof a fountain of syrup.\r\n\r\nLet us cull a few twigs of evergreen oak peopled by Kermes and place\r\nthe cut ends in a glass of water. The foliage will remain fresh for\r\nsome time—a condition which will suffice to ensure the insects’\r\nwelfare. We shall see, ere long, a colourless, transparent fluid which,\r\nin the course of a couple of days, collects itself into a drop equal in\r\nvolume to the flask from which it oozes. If it becomes too heavy the\r\ndrop falls, but without flowing over the Kermes, for the outlet is as\r\nit were a postern gate. Another drop at once begins to form. The spring\r\nis not intermittent, but perpetual; uninterrupted it sheds its solitary\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nWith the tip of the little finger let us gather this drop from the\r\nstill and taste it. Delicious! In taste and aroma it is very nearly\r\nequal to honey. If the Kermes were to lend itself to wholesale rearing\r\nas well as to the easy harvesting of its product, we should have in it\r\na valuable sugar-refiner. But it is for others to exploit it with the\r\nneedful diligence and devotion.\r\n\r\nThese others are the Ants, those patient harvesters. They make for the\r\nKermes even more eagerly than for the Plant-louse or Green-fly. The\r\nlatter is niggardly in the matter of yielding its ambrosia; the Ant has\r\nto solicit it with patience; tickling its paunch before she can obtain\r\neven a meagre sip from the tips of its tiny horns. The Kermes is a\r\nspendthrift. Fully consenting, and at any moment, it permits all comers\r\nto quench their thirst from its cellar, and its liquid largesse is\r\noffered in streams.\r\n\r\nThe Ants, therefore, crowd about the distillery; they form quite a\r\ncompany; by threes and fours they lick the opening of the gourd-like\r\nvessel; and however high the Kermes is installed amidst the foliage of\r\nthe oak, they possess a most wonderful power of discovering it. When I\r\nsee one slowly climbing I have only to follow her with my eyes; she\r\ntakes me straight to the Ant’s tavern. She is my infallible guide when,\r\nstill in its early youth, the Kermes by its minuteness would escape the\r\nglance of an eye not warned and on the alert. Even the very tiny\r\ninsects are perambulating taverns and are well frequented like the big\r\nones.\r\n\r\nOn the tree, in the full liberty of the fields, the diligence of the\r\nAnts, collecting the syrup as it oozes forth, will hardly permit us to\r\nestimate the value of the spring. The little round barrel, incessantly\r\ndrained dry, shows barely a trace of moisture round the bung-hole. We\r\nmust take an isolated twig, far from thirsty drinkers, to determine the\r\ntrue value of this flask of nectar. Then, in the absence of the Ants,\r\nwe see the liquor collecting with considerable rapidity in a drop of\r\nsurprising volume. The extravasated fluid exceeds the capacity of the\r\nbeaker, and the trickling continues, as evenly and abundantly as\r\nbefore. The sugar-refinery is now in permanent business; when there is\r\nno syrup left there is still plenty to come.\r\n\r\nThe Ants rear the Plant-lice, their milch-cows. What herds they would\r\namass, what incalculable benefits they would derive therefrom, if the\r\nKermes could only be reared in captivity! But it is found only in\r\nisolated groups, which, for that matter, are not numerous in\r\nthemselves, and it cannot be moved from spot to spot. Removed from its\r\nposition it dies, unable to take root elsewhere. The Ants exploit it\r\nwhere they find it, without the slightest effort to gather together a\r\nflock of Lice in a leafy chalet. Their ingenuity wisely draws back when\r\nconfronted by the impossible.\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of this nectar, so plentiful and so highly\r\nappreciated by the connoisseur? Can it be that it flows forth for the\r\nbenefit of the Ants? After all, why not? In virtue of their number and\r\ntheir activity as harvesters, they perform a function of far-reaching\r\nsignificance in the general picnic of living creatures. As the price of\r\ntheir services, they are granted the horn-shaped nectar of the\r\nPlant-louse and the fountain of the Kermes.\r\n\r\nAt the end of May let us break open the black capsule. Beneath the\r\nenvelope, hard and brittle, a hasty dissection shows us eggs: nothing\r\nbut eggs. We looked for the apparatus of a distiller of liqueurs, for\r\nrows of retorts; we find only an obtrusive ovary. The Kermes is little\r\nmore than a coffer bursting with germs.\r\n\r\nThe germs are white, and assembled to the number of thirty or\r\nthereabouts, in little groups or clusters, which remind us, as regards\r\ntheir arrangement, of the masses of seeds in the buttercup. Tufts of\r\nextremely fine tracheal filaments encompass the glomeruli, surrounding\r\nthem with an inextricable litter which makes an exact count impossible.\r\nA rough approximation gives us a hundred. The total of the eggs would\r\ntherefore be some thousands.\r\n\r\nWhat does the Kermes want with this prodigious number of offspring? An\r\nalchemist of the general food supply, it does as do so many others\r\namong the humble creatures predestined to the elaboration of nutritive\r\nmolecules: by means of excess numbers it seeks to avert the\r\nextermination with which it is threatened. With its liquor it provides\r\nthe Ant, an importunate guest perhaps, but not a dangerous one, with a\r\ndelicious beverage; on the other hand, with its eggs it nourishes a\r\nconsumer who would lead to the extinction of the Kermes, were it not\r\nitself subjected to a drastic thinning out.\r\n\r\nIt has so happened that I have found the lover of omelettes at work. It\r\nis a negligible little grub which creeps from one tiny cluster to\r\nanother, emptying his eggs still enclosed in their natal sheath. As a\r\nusual thing it is alone; sometimes it has companions—two, three or\r\nmore. Ten, according to my notes, is the largest number recorded by its\r\nholes of exit.\r\n\r\nHow did it find its way into the strong-box, armoured on every side\r\nwith impenetrable horn? We may be sure that it was introduced while yet\r\na germ through the button-hole aperture whence oozes the syrup. A\r\nmother must have chanced this way, who, discovering the orifice, took a\r\nsip, and then, turning herself about, plunged her oviduct into the\r\nopening. Here, without use of violence, the enemy entered the citadel.\r\n\r\nThe enemy belongs to the tribe of Chalcidians, those zealous ransackers\r\nof entrails. An extremely rapid worker, she acquires her adult form and\r\nemerges from the shell in the early part of June. In comparison with\r\nthe offspring of the Kermes she is a giant, being no less than a\r\ntwelfth part of an inch in length. The narrow dormer-window by which\r\nthe germ was introduced being no longer able to give it passage, the\r\nrecluse, with his patient, steely tooth, opens a door of emergence for\r\nhimself through the wall of the shell, so that the latter is finally\r\npierced with as many round openings as there were fellow-feasters. When\r\nthey have departed the coffer is empty; there is no trace left of the\r\nplentiful omelette.\r\n\r\nThis ravager of ovaries is of a deep bluish-black colour; dark, concave\r\nwings, closely pressed down after the fashion of the elytral apron,\r\ngiving it a vague look of the Beetle family. The head is flattened,\r\nprojecting beyond the corselet on either side; the powerful mandibles\r\nare such as are needed to perforate the tough, leathery wall. The long\r\nantennæ, incessantly vibrating, bent at an angle, slightly dilated at\r\nthe tip, are ornamented with a white ring. Dumpy and thickset, the tiny\r\ncreature runs swiftly along, polishing its wings and brushing its\r\nantennæ; it is full of delight at having emptied the belly of a Kermes.\r\nHas it a name in our scientific catalogue? I do not know, and am not\r\nespecially anxious to know. A label in barbarous Latin would afford the\r\nreader no more information than would a few lines of history.\r\n\r\nJune is nearly over. For some time the sugary oozing has ceased; the\r\nAnts no longer come to their restaurant, a sign of profound alteration\r\nwithin. The outer aspect, however, has undergone no modification. We\r\nstill have the small, black, glossy sphere, smooth and firmly fixed on\r\nits base, which is whitened with wax. With the point of a pen-knife let\r\nus break open the ebony casket, at the upper pole, at a point opposite\r\nthe point of adhesion. Its wall is quite as hard and brittle as the\r\nwing-cover of a Scarabæus. Within, not a trace remains of the juicy\r\npulp: the contents consist of a dry meal, a mixture of red and white\r\nspecks.\r\n\r\nLet us collect this powder in a small glass tube; let us reinforce our\r\nsight by a magnifying-glass, and examine it. The appearance of the\r\nstuff is amazing. This dust is moving, these ashes are alive, and with\r\nlife so numerous that the very idea of computation becomes alarming. It\r\nis the legion of the uncountable. In safeguarding a Louse fecundity\r\nknows no limits.\r\n\r\nBy their white hue we may distinguish those eggs that are not yet ripe\r\nfor hatching. Now, at the end of June, these are the less numerous. The\r\nothers, coloured by the tiny creatures within them, are bright red or\r\norange yellow. Preponderant over all is the collection of white specks,\r\nthe tattered husks of the eggs which have been hatched.\r\n\r\nNow these discarded husks are arranged in radiating clusters, just as\r\nwere the germs in the glomerulus of the ovary. This detail informs us\r\nthat there was no period of egg-laying; that is, not only were the eggs\r\nnot conveyed to a point external to the mother’s body, but they were\r\nnot even conveyed to any particular point of the enclosure bounded by\r\nthe carapace, by a common protecting roof. They were hatched on the\r\nvery site of their formation. The bunches of eggs, their arrangement\r\nand position remaining unchanged, have become clusters of offspring.\r\n\r\nThe Psyche has already provided an example of that singular genesis\r\nwhich exempts the mother from the process of egg-laying, the family\r\nbeing hatched out on the spot occupied by the eggs. Let us recall the\r\nshapeless moth, whose appearance is even more miserable than that of\r\nthe caterpillar. She withdraws herself into the husk of her chrysalid,\r\nand there she wastes away, swollen with eggs which will be hatched on\r\nthe spot. The mother Psyche becomes a lifeless bag whence emerges her\r\nliving family. This is likewise the case of the Kermes.\r\n\r\nI witness the process of birth. The new-born insects are struggling to\r\nescape from their envelopes. Many of them succeed in doing so by\r\nleaving the delicate husk of the egg where it is fastened, still\r\nincluded in the radiating pattern. Others, no less numerous, drag their\r\nsheath from its place and for a long time trail it after them, hanging\r\nto their hinder parts. It adheres so firmly that the tiny creature is\r\nable to cross the threshold of the shell with its moulted husk,\r\ncompleting its liberation in the open air. Thus it is that we find on\r\nthe natal twig, at some distance from the maternal pill, numbers of\r\nwhite discarded husks, which, if one had not closely followed the\r\nprogress of events, would give one reason to believe that the eggs were\r\nhatched outside the Kermes. These filmy envelopes are deceptive; for\r\nthe whole family was hatched inside the coffer.\r\n\r\nHaving collected the living dust with which it is now filled, let us\r\nglance at the ebony box itself. The cavity is divided into two storeys\r\nby a transverse partition, a fine-spun relic of the dessicated animal.\r\nThe individual substance of the Kermes was so little that it is now\r\nrepresented by a delicate film. The rest of the mass enclosed by the\r\nshell appertains to the ovaries. The upper storey is therefore occupied\r\nby the newly born no less than the lower.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to emerge from this latter compartment when the time of the\r\nexodus has arrived; at its base is an ever-open door, a fissure shaped\r\nlike a button-hole. But how is it possible to escape from the upper\r\nstorey, separated from the other as it is by a partition? The\r\nnewly-hatched young are so feeble, so tiny, that they would never be\r\nable to break through the membrane. Let us look more closely. The\r\npartition is pierced in the centre by a round manhole! The inhabitants\r\nof the lower storey can make immediate use of the door of their\r\ndwelling-house, the button-hole exit; those of the upper storey can\r\nreach it by means of the hole in the floor. Magnificent foresight on\r\nthe part of the mechanism of the dessication! The mother Kermes, of\r\nwhom no more is left than an unsubstantial ceiling, contrives in her\r\nsubstance a trap-door without which half her family would die\r\nimprisoned.\r\n\r\nOwing to its minute proportions, the tiny insect all but escapes the\r\nunaided eye. A good magnifying-glass shows it as a tiny Louse, shaped\r\nlike an egg, the large end of the egg to the fore, and in colour a\r\ndelicate reddish brown. It has six very active legs. Its motionless\r\nfuture, its lifeless maturity, are prefaced by a quick, toddling walk.\r\nThe long antennæ are in constant vibration; on the hinder part of the\r\nbody are two long, diaphanous cirri, which will escape remark unless we\r\nlook for them with sustained attention. There are two black eye-spots.\r\n\r\nIn the small glass test-tube in which I am observing it, the tiny\r\ncreature appears to be extremely busy. It strays hither and thither,\r\nthe antennæ outspread and waving to and fro; it climbs, descends, and\r\nclimbs again, wandering this way and that, colliding as it goes with\r\nthe torn skins of the hatched eggs. It is making ready for departure,\r\nthat is evident. This mere speck of life is about to adventure into the\r\nwide world. What does it want? Apparently a sprig of its food plant. I\r\nhave had an eye to its requirements.\r\n\r\nIn the orchard is an evergreen oak, one single specimen, a small but\r\nsturdy tree some ten to twelve feet in height. About the middle of\r\nJune, when the young are beginning to appear, I place there some thirty\r\nKermes, still adhering to their supporting twig.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all my pains, it will be no easy matter to follow the\r\nperegrinations of the Kermes’ family, should it disperse itself over\r\nthe tree, as I suppose it will. The traveller is too small and the\r\ncountry to be explored too vast. Moreover, to examine the tips of all\r\nthe boughs with the magnifying-glass, leaf by leaf, twig by twig, is\r\nimpracticable; no one’s patience would suffice to the task.\r\n\r\nA few days later I inspect those that are within my range. Many\r\nmigrations have taken place, as is proved by the white filmy skins left\r\nby the roadside. As for the young, I cannot see them anywhere, neither\r\non the bark of the twigs, nor on the leaves. Is it possible that they\r\nhave all attained the inaccessible tips of the boughs? Or can they have\r\ngone elsewhere? This is the first problem to be solved, and it must be\r\nsolved under such conditions that the emigrants cannot escape my gaze.\r\n\r\nI transplant some young evergreen oaks ten to twenty inches in height,\r\ninto flowerpots filled with leaf-mould. On the twigs of each young tree\r\nI fix, with a little drop of gum, five or six Kermes, taking especial\r\ncare not to obstruct the door of emergence. This miniature artificial\r\ncoppice is placed where it is sheltered from the fiercest heat of the\r\nsun, in my study, facing one of the windows.\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd of July I witness a migration. At the hottest time of the\r\nday, about two o’clock, the new-born Lice leave their fortress in an\r\ninnumerable swarm. The young Kermes emerge hastily from the door of\r\ntheir dwelling, the button-hole-shaped cleft; many of them dragging\r\nbehind them the discarded husk of the egg. For a moment they stand\r\nmotionless on the domed roof of their spherical house; then they\r\nscatter over the neighbouring twigs. Several of them climb upwards and\r\nreach the summit of the plant, without appearing to gain much\r\nsatisfaction from their ascent; some of them climb downwards along\r\ntheir twig, so that I cannot possibly guess what objective the swarm is\r\nseeking. It may be that we are witnessing a brief period of disorder,\r\ndue to the joy of the first few steps in a world of unrestricted\r\nfreedom; the tiny creatures may be wandering at random, abandoned to\r\nthe delights of emancipation. Let them do as they will; they will soon\r\nquiet down.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, indeed, I can no longer see a single Louse on the\r\ntree; all have found their way downwards to the black leaf-mould in the\r\nflowerpot, not far from the main stem. This mould, recently watered, is\r\nrich in the savours of foliage which has rotted and fallen into dust.\r\nThere, on a surface barely larger than one’s fingernail, the little\r\ncreatures have gathered into a closely packed flock. Not one of them\r\nmoves, so well satisfied do they seem with their pasture, or rather\r\ntheir watering-place. As far as I can see they are feeding, motionless\r\nin their well-being.\r\n\r\nI do what I can to increase their felicity. To keep the place cool and\r\nto provide a little shadow I cover it with a few dead leaves from the\r\nevergreen oak, previously moistened in a glass of water. And now,\r\nlittle Lice, you must proceed after your own fashion; I have done for\r\nyou all that I can!\r\n\r\nI have just learned of one essential point of your history, one detail,\r\nwithout which all the rest of my investigations must inevitably have\r\ncome to naught. My first conjectures, although perfectly reasonable,\r\nwere unfounded. Instead of settling down on some twig, as their mother\r\ndid before them, the young Lice descend to the ground at the foot of\r\ntheir natal tree. There, in the midst of the mosses and dead leaves,\r\nthey find a shelter offering some degree of coolness, which will\r\nnourish them with its exudations, at all events at the outset.\r\n\r\nAnd what do they live upon later?—I am not in a position to say. For\r\nfive or six days I find them on the same spot, a motionless flock. Not\r\none of them leaves the flock, not one of them descends underground.\r\nThen their numbers begin to diminish; little by little they all\r\ndisappear, evaporating as it were, returning to that nothingness from\r\nwhich they were so little removed. The flock of atomies has left not a\r\ntrace.\r\n\r\nApparently the flowerpot with its evergreen oak did not sufficiently\r\nfulfil the conditions of prosperity. There should have been also some\r\ngrasses with underground rootstocks: in short, a jungle of herbaceous\r\nvegetation, rich in superficial root-fibres in which the young Kermes\r\nwould have implanted their suckers. Is this the trouble?\r\n\r\nI continue my investigations in the open country, at the foot of some\r\nevergreen oaks which, I noted, were thickly populated in May. The\r\nfamilies of Lice are certainly there, within a fairly small radius, for\r\nthe puny little creatures are incapable of a lengthy journey. I inspect\r\nthe varied vegetation covering the ground beneath the trees; I dig,\r\nuproot, and patiently, lens in hand, examine one by one the roots and\r\nstems grubbed up. Repeatedly resumed, in winter as well as in autumn,\r\nmy laborious investigations are fruitless; the tiny Louse cannot be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nThe following year, on the return of spring, I was to learn that the\r\npresence of vegetation at the foot of the tree is not a necessity. Let\r\nus go back to the evergreen oak in the orchard. I peopled its foliage\r\nwith some thirty Kermes which had reached maturity. There emerged from\r\nit, caravan by caravan, a multitude of Lice. Now, at the foot of this\r\ntree and all around it, for a distance of some yards, the soil is\r\nperfectly bare. Not a blade of grass, not a weed of any sort, has\r\nsprouted on this surface, so recently excavated by the spade. As for\r\nthe roots of the oak itself, it is, as far as I can judge, useless to\r\ntake them into account; for they lie at depths which the tiny Louse\r\ncould never attain.\r\n\r\nYet in May the tree, hitherto exempt from Kermes, is covered with black\r\npills. My sowing has prospered; the young Lice which emerged from the\r\nshells have passed the winter underground, and on the advent of warm\r\nweather have returned to the tree, there to transform themselves into\r\nglobules. What did they live on in this ungrateful soil, which contains\r\nnot a single root-fibre? Probably on nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThey descend to earth in search of shelter rather than refreshment.\r\nTheir refuge against the inclemencies of winter is precarious indeed,\r\nif it consists, as everything seems to declare, in a few cracks in some\r\nlump of earth, not far from the surface. In a hard winter, how many of\r\nthese ill-protected creatures must disappear? To the ravages of the\r\ndevourers of new-laid eggs we must add the more dreadful depredations\r\nof winter; and thus it is that in order to preserve one life the Kermes\r\ngives birth to thousands upon thousands.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of its story is not easily discovered. It is now the\r\nbeginning of April. My three children, the joy of my declining years,\r\nlend me the keen sight of youth. Without their assistance I should\r\nabandon all thought of the chase, which I now propose to pursue on the\r\nconfines of invisibility. The previous year certain thickets of\r\nevergreen oak, well within the reach of the observer, were marked down\r\nas being thickly peopled by the Kermes. At that time I marked every\r\npopulated twig with a white thread.\r\n\r\nIt is here that my little collaborators patiently pursue their\r\ninvestigations, leaf by leaf, and twig by twig. After a brief glimpse\r\nthrough my lens the harvest is placed in a botanist’s specimen box; a\r\nmore scrupulous examination will be made in my study, with all the\r\nconveniences which the observer may require.\r\n\r\nOn the seventh of April, just as I am beginning to despair of my\r\ninvestigations, the tiny insect crosses the field of my pocket\r\nmicroscope. This is she, actually this is she! Just as I saw her last\r\nyear emerging from her natal shell, so once more I behold her now. No\r\nchange whatever is visible: neither of aspect, nor shape, nor\r\ncolouration, nor size. She goes bustling along as though busy in the\r\nextreme, searching doubtless for a spot to her liking. At every moment\r\nthe smallest wrinkle in the bark conceals her from sight. I place the\r\ntwig that bears the precious atomy under a bell-glass. On the following\r\nday I expect a moult. The bustling little insect is replaced by a\r\nmotionless corpuscle. This is the first stage of the globular Kermes.\r\nFortune has only once vouchsafed me such a “find,” which would have\r\nbeen examined in greater detail had I possessed a sufficient number of\r\nsubjects. My inspection of the evergreen oaks was somewhat in arrears;\r\nI ought to have made it in March. At this period, I imagine, I should\r\nhave caught the insect emerging from the soil and returning to the\r\nfoliage of its oak-tree, in order there to undergo transformation.\r\nInstead of one single subject I should have had many, though even then\r\nI could not have counted upon a numerous collection, for the hardships\r\nof winter have certainly thinned out those families, which were in the\r\nbeginning so numerous. They descended from the tree in their hundreds\r\nof thousands; they climb it again in scanty groups, as is attested by\r\nthe scarcity of the black globules in the warm weather.\r\n\r\nAs for what becomes of the climbers, my single specimen tells us\r\nplainly enough. It has become a spherical speck, the indubitable sign\r\nof the future Kermes. In a few days’ time it has dried up, despite the\r\nglass of water into which the base of the twig was immersed.\r\nFortunately I have a few other similar corpuscles, a little more\r\ndeveloped. My gleanings give me two kinds of corpuscle.\r\n\r\nThe more numerous are spherical in shape, their size varying according\r\nto their age. The smallest are rarely a millimetre [76] in diameter.\r\nThe ventral surface is flat, and surrounded by a snowy cushion, the\r\nrough foundation of the waxy base. The dorsal surface is rounded, and\r\nin colour of a rusty red or pale chestnut with delicate white tufts\r\ndistributed without any orderly arrangement. In this costume the young\r\nKermes reminds us of a certain shell found in tropical seas: the\r\nstriped or tiger cowry. The sugar refinery is already at work. At the\r\nback of the shell a limpid drop is gathering, to which the Ants repair\r\nin order to quench their thirst. In a few weeks’ time the colour has\r\nchanged to an ebony black, the sphere has attained the size of a pea\r\nand the Kermes has reached its final state.\r\n\r\nThe minority stretch themselves out in the likeness of a tiny\r\nhalf-contracted slug. The ventral surface is flat and its whole area is\r\nclosely applied to the twig. The dorsal surface is convex, and its\r\ncolour a more or less vivid amber yellow. It is sprinkled with\r\nprotuberant specks of a snowy white, arranged in longitudinal rows to\r\nthe number of five or seven. With its amber yellow colouration and its\r\nornamentation of white specks, the tiny creature has something of the\r\nlook of a certain kind of pastry which is sprinkled with spots of white\r\nsugar. There is no oozing of a syrupy liquid to the rear of the insect,\r\nso that the Ants do not visit it.\r\n\r\nI have conjectured that this second form is the larval state of the\r\nmales. From this, I imagine, will emerge winged insects ready for\r\nmating. To verify this guess of mine is impossible. My slug-like\r\nspecimens die on their withering twig, and to follow their development\r\nbeyond the walls of my study would be an undertaking too great for my\r\npatience.\r\n\r\nOf this very incomplete history of the Kermes of the oak-tree, one\r\npoint especially should be remembered. The mother, an enormous ovary,\r\nexempt from the labours of egg-laying, contracts into a strong-box in\r\nwhich the family is hatched without the removal of the eggs. Within\r\nthis shrivelled relic the family swarms in its thousands until the\r\nmoment of exodus. Simplifying to the very extreme the usual method of\r\nprocreation, the insect turns into a boxful of young.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Thursday is a whole holiday in the French schools.
