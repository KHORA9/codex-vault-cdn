MIRICK, PRINTER, GREENFIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Treatise on the Hive and the Honey-Bee, is respectfully submitted\r\nby the Author, to the candid consideration of those who are interested\r\nin the culture of the most useful as well as wonderful Insect, in all\r\nthe range of Animated Nature. The information which it contains will be\r\nfound to be greatly in advance of anything which has yet been presented\r\nto the English Reader; and, as far as facilities for practical\r\nmanagement are concerned, it is believed to be a very material advance\r\nover anything which has hitherto been communicated to the Apiarian\r\nPublic.\r\n\r\nDebarred, by the state of his health, from the more appropriate duties\r\nof his Office, and compelled to seek an employment which would call him,\r\nas much as possible, into the open air, the Author indulges the hope\r\nthat the result of his studies and observations, in an important branch\r\nof Natural History, will be found of service to the Community as well as\r\nto himself. The satisfaction which he has taken in his researches, has\r\nbeen such that he has felt exceedingly desirous of interesting others,\r\nin a pursuit which, (without any reference to its pecuniary profits,)\r\nis capable of exciting the delight and enthusiasm of all intelligent\r\nobservers. The Creator may be seen in all the works of his hands; but in\r\nfew more directly than in the wise economy of the Honey-Bee.\r\n\r\n    \"What well appointed commonwealths! where each\r\n    Adds to the stock of happiness for all;\r\n    Wisdom's own forums! whose professors teach\r\n    Eloquent lessons in their vaulted hall!\r\n    Galleries of art! and schools of industry!\r\n    Stores of rich fragrance! Orchestras of song!\r\n    What marvelous seats of hidden alchemy!\r\n    How oft, when wandering far and erring long,\r\n    Man might learn truth and virtue from the BEE!\"\r\n                                        _Bowring._\r\n\r\nThe attention of Clergymen is particularly solicited to the study of\r\nthis branch of Natural History. An intimate acquaintance with the\r\nwonders of the Bee-Hive, while it would benefit them in various ways,\r\nmight lead them to draw their illustrations, more from natural objects\r\nand the world around them, and in this way to adapt them better to the\r\ncomprehension and sympathies of their hearers. It was, we know, the\r\nconstant practice of our Lord and Master, to illustrate his teachings\r\nfrom the birds of the air, the lilies of the field, and the common walks\r\nof life and pursuits of men. Common Sense, Experience and Religion alike\r\ndictate that we should follow his example.\r\n\r\n                                                   L. L. LANGSTROTH.\r\n    _Greenfield, Mass., May 25, 1853._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION--CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nDeplorable state of bee-keeping. New era anticipated, 13.

Expelled from the hive, 55. If not expelled, hive\r\nshould be examined. Provision to avoid \"in and in breeding,\" 56. Close\r\nbreeding enfeebles colonies. Working bees, account of. Number in a hive,\r\n58. All females with imperfect ovaries. Fertile workers not tolerated\r\nwhere there are queens, 59. Honey receptacle. Pollen basket. The sting.\r\nSting of bees, 60. Often lost in using. Penalty of its loss. Sting not\r\nlost by other insects. Labors of workers, 61. Age of bees, 62. Bees\r\nuseful to the last, 63. Cocoons not removed by the bees. Breeding cells\r\nbecoming too small are reconstructed. Old comb should be removed. Brood\r\ncomb not to be changed every year, 64. Inventors of hives too often men\r\nof \"one idea.\" Folly of large closets for bees, 65. Reason of limited\r\ncolonies. Mother wasps and hornets only survive Winter.

Wax, how made. Formed of any saccharine substance. Huber's\r\nexperiments, 76. High temperature necessary to its composition, 77. Heat\r\ngenerated in forming. Twenty pounds of honey to form one of wax. Value\r\nof empty comb in the new hive. How to free comb from eggs of the moth,\r\n78. Combs having bee-bread of great value. How to empty comb and replace\r\nit in the hive, 79. Artificial comb. Experiment with wax proposed, 80.\r\nIts results, if successful. Comb made chiefly in the night. 81. Honey\r\nand comb made simultaneously. Wax a non-conductor of heat. Some of the\r\nbrood cells uniform in size, others vary, 82. Form of cells\r\nmathematically perfect, 83. Honey comb a demonstration of a \"Great First\r\nCause,\" 84.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPROPOLIS OR BEE GLUE. Whence it is obtained. Huber's experiment, 85. Its\r\nuse. Comb varnished with it. The moth deposits her eggs in it, 85.\r\nPropolis difficult for bees to work. Curious use of it by bees, 87.\r\nIngenuity of bees admirable, 88.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPOLLEN OR BEE-BREAD. Whence obtained. Its use. Brood cannot be raised\r\nwithout it. Pollen nitrogenous. Its use discovered by Huber, 89. Its\r\ncollection by bees indicates a healthy queen. Experiment showing the\r\nimportance of bee-bread to a colony, 90. Not used in making comb. Bees\r\nprefer it fresh. Surplus in old hives to be used to supply its want to\r\nyoung hives. Pollen and honey both secured at the same time by bees.\r\nMode of gathering pollen, 91. Packing down. Bees gather one kind of\r\npollen at a time. They aid in the impregnation of plants. History of the\r\nbee plain proof of the wisdom of the Creator. Bees made for man, 92.\r\nVirgil's opinion of bees. Rye meal a substitute for pollen. Quantity\r\nused by each colony, 93. Wheat flour a substitute. The improved hive\r\nfacilitates feeding bees with meal. The discovery of a substitute for\r\npollen removes an obstacle to the cultivation of honey bees, 94.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nFifty-four Advantages which ought to be found in an improved hive,\r\n95-110. Some desirable qualities the movable comb hive does not pretend\r\nto! Is the result of years of study and observation. It has been tested\r\nby experience, 111. Not claimed as a perfect hive. Old-fashioned\r\nbee-keepers found most profit, &c. Simplest form of hive, 112. Bee\r\nculture where it was fifty years ago. Best hives. New hive is submitted\r\nto the judgment of candid bee-keepers, 113.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPROTECTION AGAINST EXTREMES OF HEAT, COLD AND DAMPNESS. Many colonies\r\ndestroyed by extremes of weather. Evils of thin hives. Bees not torpid\r\nin Winter. When frozen are killed, 114. Take exercise to keep warm.\r\nPerish if unable to preserve suitable degree of warmth. Are often\r\nstarved in the midst of plenty. Eat an extra quantity of food in thin,\r\ncold hives, 115. Muscular exertion occasions waste of muscular fiber.\r\nBees need less food when quiet than when excited. Experiment, wintering\r\nbees in a dry cellar, 116. Protection must generally be given in open\r\nair. None but diseased bees discharge fæces in the hive. Moisture, its\r\ninjurious effects. Free air needful in cold weather, with the common\r\nhive, 117. Loss by their flying out in cold weather. Protection against\r\nextremes of weather of the very first importance. Honey, our country\r\nfavorable to its production. Colonies in forests strong. Reasons for\r\nthis, 118. Russian and Polish bee-keepers successful. Their mode of\r\nmanagement, 119. Objection of want of air answered, 120. Bees need but\r\nlittle air in Winter if protected. Protection in reference to the\r\nconstruction of hives. Double hives, preferable to plank. Made warm in\r\nWinter by packing. Double hives, inside may be of glass, 121. Advantages\r\nof glass over wood, 122. Advantages of double glass. Disadvantages of\r\ndouble hives in Spring. Avoided by the improved hive, 123. Covered\r\nApiaries exclude the sun in Spring. Reason for discarding them. Sun, its\r\neffect in producing early swarms in thin hives. Protected hives fall for\r\nwant of sun. Enclosed Apiaries, nuisances. Thin hives ought to be given\r\nup, they are expensive in waste of honey and bees, 124. Comparative\r\ncheapness of new and old hives, 125. Protector against injurious\r\nweather. Proper location of bees. Preparations for setting hives, 126.\r\nProtector should be open in Summer and banked in Winter. Cheaper than an\r\nApiary. Summer air of Protector like forest air. In Winter uniform and\r\nmild, 127. Bees will not be enticed out in improper weather. Secures\r\ntheir natural heat. Dead bees, &c., to be removed in Winter. Temperature\r\nof the Protector, 128. Importance of the Protector. Its economy in food,\r\n129.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nVENTILATION. Artificial ventilation produced by bees. Purity of air in\r\nthe hive, 130. Bad air fatal to bees, eggs and larvæ, 131. Bees when\r\ndisturbed need much air. Dysentery, how produced. Post mortem condition\r\nof suffocated bees, 132. Great annoyance of excessive heat. Bees leave\r\nthe hive to save the comb. Ventilating instinct wonderful, 133. Should\r\nshame man for his neglect of ventilation. Comparative expense of\r\nventilation to man and bees, 134. Importance of ventilation to man. Its\r\nneglect induces disease, 135. Plants cannot thrive without free air. The\r\nunion of warmth and ventilation in Winter an important question.\r\nHouse-builder and stove-maker combine against fresh air, 136. Run-away\r\nslave boxed up. Evil qualities of bad air aggravated by heat. Dwellings\r\nand public buildings generally deficient in ventilation. Degeneracy will\r\nensue, 137. Women the greatest sufferers. Necessity of reform, 138.\r\nPublic buildings should be required to have plenty of air. Improved\r\nhive, its adaptedness to secure ventilation, 139. Nutt's hive too\r\ncomplicated. Ventilation independent of the entrance, 140. Hive may be\r\nentirely closed without incommoding the bees. Ventilators should be\r\neasily removable to be cleansed. Ventilation from above injurious except\r\nwhen bees are to be moved, 141. Variable size of the entrance adapts it\r\nto all seasons. Ventilators should be closed in Spring. Downing on\r\nventilation, (note,) 142.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nSWARMING AND HIVING. Bees swarming a beautiful sight. Poetic description\r\nby Evans. Design of swarming, 143. The honey bee unlike other insects in\r\nits colonizing habits. It is chilled by a temperature below 50 deg.\r\nWould perish in Winter if not congregated in masses. Admirable\r\nadaptation, 144. Swarming necessary. Circumstances in which it takes\r\nplace. June the swarming month. Preparations for swarming. Old queen\r\naccompanies the first swarm. No infallible signs of 1st swarming, 145.\r\nFickleness of bees about swarming. Indications of swarming. Hours of\r\nswarming, 146. Proceedings within the hive before swarming. Interesting\r\nscene. Bells and frying-pans useless, 147. Neglected bees apt to fly\r\naway in swarming. Bees properly cared for seldom do it. Methods of\r\narresting their flight when started, 148. Conduct of bees in\r\ndisagreeable hives, 149. Why bees swarm before selecting a new home.\r\nThey rarely cluster without the queen. Interesting experiment, 150.\r\nScouts to search for new abodes. Scouts sent out before and after\r\nswarming, 151. Bees remain awhile after alighting. Curious incident\r\nstated by Mr. Zollickoffer. Necessity of scouts. Considerations\r\nconfirmed, 152. Re-population of the hive, 153. Inability of bees to\r\nfind their hive when it has been removed. After swarms, 154. Different\r\ntreatment to the cells of dead and living queens. Royal larvæ sometimes\r\nprotected against the queens. Anger of the queen at such interference,\r\n155. Second swarming, its indications. Time, 156. Double swarms. Third\r\nswarm. After swarms seriously reduce the strength of the hive. Wise\r\narrangement, 157. After-swarming avoided by the improved hive.\r\nImpregnation of queens. Dangerous for queens to mistake their own hives,\r\n158. Precautions against this. Proper color for hives. Time of laying\r\neggs. None but worker eggs, the first season, 159. Directions for\r\nhiving. Hives should be painted and well dried. Bees reluctant to enter\r\nthin warm hives in the sun, 160. Management with the improved hives,\r\n161. Drone combs should never be used as guide comb. Pleasure of bees in\r\nfinding comb in their new quarters. Bees never voluntarily enter empty\r\nhives. Rubbing the hive with herbs useless, 162. Small trees or bushes\r\nin front of hives. Inexperienced Apiarian should wear a bee-dress.\r\nModerate dispatch in hiving needful, 163. Process of hiving particularly\r\ndescribed, 164. Old method of hiving should be abandoned, 166.\r\nImportance of speedy hiving. Should be moved as soon as hived. Curious\r\nfact stated by Dr. Scudamore, (note), 167. How to secure the queen. She\r\ndoes not sting. Hiving before the hives are ready, 168. Another method\r\nof hiving. Natural swarming profitable. Objections to natural swarming.\r\nCommon hive gives inadequate winter protection, 169. With it, the bees\r\noften swarm too much. With the improved hive this is avoided.\r\nDisadvantages of returning after-swarms. Third objection, inability to\r\nstrengthen small late swarms, 170. Evils of feeble stocks. Fourth\r\nobjection, loss of queen irreparable. By the new hive her loss is easily\r\nsupplied, 171. Fifth, common hives inconvenient when bees do not swarm.\r\nThis objection removed by the new hive. Sixth, the ravages of the moth\r\neasily prevented by the improved hive. Seventh, the old queen, when\r\ninfertile, cannot be removed or replaced. Both can be done by the new\r\nhive, 172.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n(Two Chapters numbered x, by error of the Press.)\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL SWARMING. Numerous efforts to dispense with natural swarming.\r\nDifficulties of natural swarming. First, many swarms are lost, 173.\r\nSecond, time and labor required. Sabbath labor, 174. Perplexities to\r\nfarmers. Third, large Apiaries cannot be established, 175. Fourth,\r\nuncertainty of swarming. Disappointments from this source, 176. Efforts\r\nto devise a surer method, 178. Columellas's mode of obtaining swarms.\r\nHyginus. Small success which attended, those efforts, Schirach's\r\ndiscovery, 179. Huber's directions. Not adapted to general use. Dividing\r\nhives in this country unsuitable. Bees without mature queens make no\r\npreparation to rear workers, 180. Dividing hives to multiply colonies\r\nwill not answer, 181. Huber's hive even, inadequate. Common dividing\r\nhives unsuccessful. Multiplying by brood comb in an empty hive, vain,\r\n182. Multiplying by removal and substitution useless. Mortality of bees\r\nin working season, 183. Connecting apartments a failure, 184. Many\r\nprefer non-swarming hives, 185. Profitable in honey but calculated to\r\nexterminate the insect. Improved hive good non-swarmer, if desired.\r\nDisadvantages of non-swarming. Queen bee becomes infertile. Remedied by\r\nthe use of the improved hive, 186. Practicable mode of artificial\r\nswarming, 187. Bees will welcome to their hives strange bees that come\r\nloaded. Will destroy such as come empty, 188. Forced swarming requires\r\nknowledge of the economy of the bee-hive. Common hives give no facility\r\nfor learning the bee's habits. Equalizing a divided swarm, 190. Bees in\r\nparent hive, if removed, to be confined and watered, 191. Bees removed\r\nwill return to their old place. Supplying bees with water by a straw.\r\nWater necessary to prepare food for the larvæ, 192. New forced swarms to\r\nbe returned to the place of the old one, or removed to a distance.\r\nTreatment to wont them to new place in the Apiary, 193. Bees forget\r\ntheir new locations. Objection to forced swarming in common hives, 194.\r\nForced swarming by the new hives removes the objection. Mode of forcing\r\nswarms by the new hives, 195. Queen to be searched for. Important that\r\nshe should be in the right hive, 196. Convenience of forced swarming in\r\nsupplying extra queens. Mode of supplying them. Should be done by day\r\nlight and in pleasant weather, 197. Honey-water not to be used. Safety\r\nto the operator. Forced swarming may be performed at mid-day. Advantages\r\nof the shape of the new hive, 198. Huber's observation on the effect of\r\nsudden light in the hive. True solution of the phenomenon. Bees at the\r\ntop of the hive, less belligerent than those at the bottom, 199. Sudden\r\njars to be avoided. Removal of honey-board. Sprinkling with sugar-water,\r\n200. Loosening the frames. Removing the comb. Bees will adhere to their\r\ncomb, 201. Natural swarming imitated. How to catch the queen. Frames\r\nprotected from cold and robbery by bees. Frames returned to the hive.\r\nHoney-cover, how managed. Motions of bee-keeper to be gentle. Bees must\r\nnot be breathed on. Success in the operation certain, 202. New colonies\r\nmay be thus formed in ten minutes. Natural swarming wholly prevented. If\r\nattempted by the bees cannot succeed. How to remove the wings of the\r\nqueens, 203. Precaution against loss of queen by old age. Advantages of\r\nthis, 204. Certainty and ease of artificial swarming with the new hive.\r\nAfter-swarms prevented if desired, 205. Large harvests of honey and\r\nafter-swarming impracticable. Danger of too rapid increase of stocks.\r\nImportance of understanding his object, by the bee-keeper, 206. The\r\nmatter made plain, 207. Apiarians dissuaded from more than tripling\r\ntheir stocks in a year. Tenfold increase of stocks attainable, 209.\r\nCertain increase, not rapid, most needed. Cautions concerning\r\nexperiments, 210. Honey, largest yield obtained by doubling colonies.\r\nThe process, 211. May be done at swarming time. Bees recognize each\r\nother by smell, 213. Importance of following these directions\r\nillustrated. Process of uniting swarms simplified by the new hive, 214.\r\nVery rapid increase of colonies precarious. Mode of effecting the most\r\nrapid increase, 215. Nucleus system, 217. Can a queen be raised from any\r\negg? Two sorts of workers, wax workers and nurses, 218. Probable\r\nexplication of a difficulty, 219. Experimenting difficult work. Swarming\r\nseason best time for artificial swarming. Amusing perplexity of bees on\r\nfinding their hive changed, 220. Perseverance of bees. Interesting\r\nincident illustrating it, 221. Novel and successful mode of forming\r\nnuclei, 223. Mode of managing nuclei, 225. Danger of over-feeding.\r\nIncreasing stocks by doubling hives, 229. Important rule for multiplying\r\nstocks. How to direct the strength of a colony to the rearing of young\r\nbees, 230. Proper dimensions of hives. Reasons therefor, 231. Easy\r\nconstruction of the improved hive. Precaution of queen bees in their\r\ncombats, 234. Reluctance of bees to receive a new queen. Expedient to\r\novercome this. Queen nursery, 235. Mode of rearing numerous queens, 237.\r\nControl of the comb the soul of good bee-culture. Objection against\r\nbee-keeping answered, 233. No \"royal road\" to bee-keeping. A prediction,\r\n239.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nENEMIES OF BEES. Bee-moth, its ravages. Defiance against it, 240. Its\r\nhabits. Known to Virgil. Time of appearance. Nocturnal in habits, 241.\r\nTheir agility. Vigilance of the bees against the moth. Havoc of sin in\r\nthe heart, 242. Disgusting effects of the moth worm in a hive. Wax the\r\nfood of the moth larvæ. Making their cocoons, 243. Devices to escape the\r\nbees. Time of development, 244. Habits of the female when laying eggs.\r\nOf the worm when hatched, 245. Our climate favorable to the increase of\r\nthe moth. Moth not a native of America, 246. Honey, its former plenty.\r\nPresent depressure of its culture. Old mode of culture described, 247.\r\nDepredations of the moth increased by patent hives. Aim of patent hives.\r\nSulphur or starvation, 249. Feeble swarms a nuisance, 250. Notion\r\nprevailing in relation to breaking up stocks. Improved hives valueless\r\nwithout improved system of treatment, 251. Pretended secrets in the\r\nmanagement of bees. Strong stocks thrive under almost any circumstances,\r\n252. Stocks in costly hives. Circumstances under which the moth succeeds\r\nin a hive, 253. Signs of worms in a hive, 254. When entrenched difficult\r\nto remove. Method of avoiding their ravages, 255. Combs having moth eggs\r\nto be removed and smoked, 257. Uncovered comb to be removed, 258. Loss\r\nof the queen the most fruitful occasion of ravages by the moth.\r\nExperiments on this point, 259. Attempts to defend a queenless swarm\r\nagainst the moth useless, 260. Strong queenless colonies destroyed when\r\nfeeble ones with queens are untouched. Common hives furnish no remedy\r\nfor the loss of the queen.

LANGSTROTH'S MOVABLE COMB HIVE.\r\n\r\nPatented October 5, 1862.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach comb in this hive is attached to a separate, movable frame, and in\r\nless than five minutes they may all be taken out, without cutting or\r\ninjuring them, or at all enraging the bees. Weak stocks may be quickly\r\nstrengthened by helping them to honey and maturing brood from stronger\r\nones; queenless colonies may be rescued from certain ruin by supplying\r\nthem with the means of obtaining another queen; and the ravages of the\r\nmoth effectually prevented, as at any time the hive may be readily\r\nexamined and all the worms, &c., removed from the combs. New colonies\r\nmay be formed in less time than is usually required to hive a natural\r\nswarm; or the hive may be used as a non-swarmer, or managed on the\r\ncommon swarming plan. The surplus honey may be taken from the interior\r\nof the hive on the frames or in upper boxes or glasses, in the most\r\nconvenient, beautiful and saleable forms. Colonies may be safely\r\ntransferred from any other hive to this, at any season of the year, from\r\nApril to October, as the brood, combs, honey and all the contents of the\r\nhive are transferred with them, and securely fastened in the frames.\r\nThat the combs can always be removed from this hive with ease and\r\nsafety, and that the new system, by giving the perfect control over all\r\nthe combs, effects a complete revolution in practical bee-keeping, the\r\nsubscriber prefers to _prove_ rather than assert. Practical Apiarians\r\nand all who wish to purchase rights and hives, are invited to visit his\r\nApiary, where combs, honey and bees will be taken from the hives;\r\ncolonies which may be brought to him for that purpose, transferred from\r\nany old hive; queens, and the whole process of rearing them constantly\r\nexhibited; new colonies formed, and all processes connected with the\r\npractical management of an Apiary fully illustrated and explained.\r\n\r\nThose who have any considerable number of bees, will find it to their\r\ninterest to have at least one movable comb-hive in their Apiary, from\r\nwhich they may, in a few minutes, supply any colony which has lost its\r\nqueen, with the means of rearing another.\r\n\r\nThe hive and right will be furnished on the following terms. For an\r\nindividual or farm right, five dollars. This will entitle the purchaser\r\nto use and construct for his own use on his own premises, as many hives\r\nas he chooses. The hives are manufactured by machinery, and can probably\r\nbe delivered, freight included, at any Railroad Station in New England,\r\nor New York, cheaper than they could be made in small quantities on the\r\nspot. On receipt of a hive, the purchaser can decide for himself,\r\nwhether he prefers to make them, or to order them of the Patentee. For\r\none dollar, postage paid, the book will be sent free by mail. On receipt\r\nof ten dollars, a beautiful hive showing all the combs, (with glass on\r\nfour sides,) will be sent with right, freight paid to any railroad\r\nstation in New England or New York: a right and hive which will\r\naccommodate _two_ colonies, with glass on each side, for twelve dollars;\r\nfor seven dollars, a right and a well made hive that any one can\r\nconstruct who can handle the simplest tools. In all cases where the\r\nhives are sent out of New England or New York, as the freight will not\r\nbe prepaid, a dollar will be deducted from the above prices.\r\n                                     Address\r\n                                         L. L. LANGSTROTH,\r\n                                              _Greenfield, Mass._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present condition of practical bee-keeping in this country, is known\r\nto be deplorably low. From the great mass of agriculturists, and others\r\nfavorably situated for obtaining honey, it receives not the slightest\r\nattention. Notwithstanding the large number of patent hives which have\r\nbeen introduced, the ravages of the bee-moth have increased, and success\r\nis becoming more and more precarious. Multitudes have abandoned the\r\npursuit in disgust, while many of the most experienced, are fast\r\nsettling down into the conviction that all the so-called \"Improved\r\nHives\" are delusions, and that they must return to the simple box or\r\nhollow log, and \"_take up_\" their bees with sulphur, in the\r\nold-fashioned way.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of public opinion, it requires no little courage to\r\nventure upon the introduction of a new hive and system of management;\r\nbut I feel confident that a _new era_ in bee-keeping has arrived, and\r\ninvite the attention of all interested, to the reasons for this belief.\r\nA perusal of this Manual, will, I trust, convince them that there is a\r\nbetter way than any with which they have yet been acquainted. They will\r\nhere find many hitherto mysterious points in the physiology of the\r\nhoney-bee, clearly explained, and much valuable information never before\r\ncommunicated to the public.\r\n\r\nIt is now nearly fifteen years since I first turned my attention to the\r\ncultivation of bees. The state of my health having compelled me to live\r\nmore and more in the open air, I have devoted a large portion of my\r\ntime, of late years, to a careful investigation of their habits, and to\r\na series of minute and thorough experiments in the construction of\r\nhives, and the best methods of managing them, so as to secure the\r\nlargest practical results.\r\n\r\nVery early in my Apiarian studies, I procured an imported copy of the\r\nwork of the celebrated Huber, and constructed a hive on his plan, which\r\nfurnished me with favorable opportunities of verifying some of his most\r\nvaluable discoveries; and I soon found that the prejudices existing\r\nagainst him, were entirely unfounded. Believing that his discoveries\r\nlaid the foundation for a more extended and profitable system of\r\nbee-keeping, I began to experiment with hives of various construction.\r\n\r\nThe result of all these investigations fell far short of my\r\nexpectations. I became, however, most thoroughly convinced that no hives\r\nwere fit to be used, unless they furnished _uncommon protection_ against\r\n_extremes_ of _heat_ and more especially of COLD. I accordingly\r\ndiscarded all thin hives made of inch stuff, and constructed my hives of\r\n_doubled_ materials, enclosing a \"dead air\" space all around.\r\n\r\nThese hives, although more expensive in the first cost, proved to be\r\nmuch cheaper in the end, than those I had previously used. The bees\r\n_wintered_ remarkably well in them, and swarmed _early_ and with unusual\r\n_regularity_. My next step in advance, was, while I secured my surplus\r\nhoney in the most convenient, beautiful and salable forms, so to\r\nfacilitate the entrance of the bees into the honey receptacles, as to\r\nsecure the largest fruits from their labors.\r\n\r\nAlthough I felt confident that my hive possessed some valuable\r\npeculiarities, I still found myself unable to remedy many of the\r\ncasualties to which bee-keeping is liable. I now perceived that no hive\r\ncould be made to answer my expectations unless it gave me the _complete\r\ncontrol of the combs_, so that I might remove any, or all of them at\r\npleasure. The use of the Huber hive had convinced me that with proper\r\nprecautions, the combs might be removed without _enraging_ the bees, and\r\nthat these insects were capable of being domesticated or _tamed_, to a\r\nmost surprising degree. A knowledge of these facts was absolutely\r\nnecessary to the further progress of my invention, for without it, I\r\nshould have regarded a hive designed to allow of the removal of the\r\ncombs, as too dangerous in use, to be of any practical value. At first,\r\nI used movable slats or bars placed on rabbets in the front and back of\r\nthe hive. The bees were induced to build their combs upon these bars,\r\nand in carrying them down, to fasten them to the sides of the hive. By\r\nsevering the attachments to the sides, I was able, at any time, to\r\nremove the combs suspended from the bars. There was nothing _new_ in the\r\nuse of movable _bars_; the invention being probably, at least, a hundred\r\nyears old; and I had myself used such hives on Bevan's plan, very early\r\nin the commencement of my experiments. The chief peculiarity in my\r\nhives, as now constructed, was the facility with which these bars could\r\nbe removed without enraging the bees, and their combination with my new\r\nmode of obtaining the surplus honey.\r\n\r\nWith hives of this construction I commenced experimenting on a larger\r\nscale than ever, and soon arrived at results which proved to be of the\r\nvery first importance. I found myself able, if I wished it, to _dispense\r\nentirely_ with _natural swarming_, and yet to multiply colonies with\r\nmuch greater _rapidity_ and _certainty_ than by the common methods. I\r\ncould, in a _short time, strengthen my feeble colonies_, and furnish\r\nthose which had _lost their Queen_ with the means of _obtaining\r\nanother_. If I suspected that any thing was the matter with a hive, I\r\ncould _ascertain_ its _true condition_, by making a thorough examination\r\nof every part, and if the _worms had gained a lodgment_, I could quickly\r\n_dispossess_ them. In short, I could perform all the operations which\r\nwill be explained in this treatise, and I now believed that bee-keeping\r\ncould be made _highly profitable_, and as much a matter of _certainty_,\r\nas any other branch of rural economy.\r\n\r\nI perceived, however, that one thing was _yet_ wanting. The _cutting_ of\r\nthe combs from their attachments to the _sides_ of the hive, in order to\r\nremove them, was attended with much loss of _time_ to myself and to the\r\nbees, and in order to _facilitate_ this operation, the construction of\r\nmy hive was necessarily _complicated_. This led me to invent a method by\r\nwhich the combs were attached to MOVABLE FRAMES, and suspended in the\r\nhives, _so as to touch neither the top, bottom, nor sides_. By this\r\ndevice, I was able to remove the combs at pleasure, and if desired, I\r\ncould speedily transfer them, bees and all, _without any cutting_, to\r\nanother hive. I have experimented largely with hives of this\r\nconstruction, and find that they answer most admirably, all the ends\r\nproposed in their invention.\r\n\r\nWhile experimenting in the summer of 1851, with some observing hives of\r\na peculiar construction, I discovered that bees could be made to work in\r\nglass hives, _exposed to the full light of day_. The notice, in a\r\nPhiladelphia newspaper, of this discovery, procured me the pleasure of\r\nan acquaintance with Rev. Dr. Berg, pastor of a Dutch Reformed church in\r\nthat city. From him, I first learned that a Prussian clergyman, of the\r\nname of Dzierzon, (pronounced Tseertsone,) had attracted the attention\r\nof crowned heads, by his important discoveries in the management of\r\nbees. Before he communicated the particulars of these discoveries, I\r\nexplained to Dr. Berg, my system of management, and showed him my hive.\r\nHe expressed the greatest astonishment at the wonderful similarity in\r\nour methods of management, both of us having carried on our\r\ninvestigations without the slightest knowledge of each other's labors.\r\nOur hives, he found to differ in some very important respects. In the\r\nDzierzon hive, the combs are not attached to _movable frames_, but to\r\n_bars_, so that they cannot, _without cutting_, be removed from the\r\nhive. In my hive, which is opened _from the top_, any comb may be taken\r\nout, without at all disturbing the others; whereas, in the Dzierzon\r\nhive, which is opened from one of the ends, it is often necessary to\r\n_cut_ and _remove many_ combs, in order to get access to a particular\r\none; thus, if the _tenth_ comb from the end is to be removed, _nine_\r\ncombs must be first _cut and taken out_. All this consumes a large\r\namount of time. The German hive does not furnish the surplus honey in a\r\nform which would be found most salable in our markets, or which would\r\nadmit of safe transportation in the comb. Notwithstanding these\r\ndisadvantages, it has achieved a _great triumph_ in Germany, and given a\r\n_new impulse_ to the cultivation of bees.\r\n\r\nThe following letter from Samuel Wagner, Esq., cashier of the bank in\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, will show the results which have been obtained in\r\nGermany, by the new system of management, and his estimate of the\r\nsuperior value of my hive to those in use there.\r\n\r\n                                      YORK, PA., DEC. 24, 1852.\r\n    DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nThe Dzierzon theory and the system of bee-management based thereon, were\r\noriginally promulgated, _hypothetically_, in the \"Eichstadt\r\nBienenzeitung\" or Bee-journal, in 1845, and at once arrested my\r\nattention. Subsequently, when in 1848, at the instance of the Prussian\r\ngovernment, the Rev. Mr. Dzierzon published his \"Theory and Practice of\r\nBee Culture,\" I imported a copy, which reached me in 1849, and which I\r\ntranslated prior to January 1850. Before the translation was completed,\r\nI received a visit from my friend, the Rev. Dr. Berg, of Philadelphia,\r\nand in the course of conversation on bee-keeping, mentioned to him the\r\nDzierzon theory and system, as one which I regarded as new and very\r\nsuperior, though I had had no opportunity for testing it practically. In\r\nFebruary following, when in Philadelphia, I left with him the\r\ntranslation in manuscript--up to which period, I doubt whether any other\r\nperson in this country had any knowledge of the Dzierzon theory; except\r\nto Dr. Berg I had never mentioned it to any one, save in very general\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1851, Dr. Berg again visited York, and stated to me your\r\ninvestigations, discoveries and inventions. From the account Dr. Berg\r\ngave me, I felt assured that you had devised substantially the _same\r\nsystem_ as that so successfully pursued by Mr. Dzierzon; but how far\r\n_your hive_ resembled his I was unable to judge from description alone.\r\nI inferred, however, several points of difference. The coincidence as to\r\nsystem, and the principles on which it was evidently founded, struck me\r\nas exceedingly singular and interesting, because I felt confident that\r\nyou had no more knowledge of Mr. Dzierzon and his labors, before Dr.\r\nBerg mentioned him and his book to you, than Mr. Dzierzon had of you.\r\nThese circumstances made me very anxious to examine your hives, and\r\ninduced me to visit your Apiary in the village of West Philadelphia,\r\nlast August. In the absence of the keeper, as I informed you, I took the\r\nliberty to explore the premises thoroughly, opening and inspecting a\r\nnumber of the hives, and noticing the internal arrangement of the parts.\r\nThe result was, that I came away convinced that though your system was\r\nbased on the same principles as Dzierzon's, yet that your hive was\r\nalmost totally different from his, in construction and arrangement; that\r\nwhile the same objects _substantially_ are attained by each, your hive\r\nis more simple, more convenient, and much better adapted for general\r\nintroduction and use, since the mode of using it can be more easily\r\ntaught. Of its ultimate and triumphant success I have no doubt. I\r\nsincerely believe that when it comes under the notice of Mr. Dzierzon,\r\nhe will himself prefer it to his own. It in fact combines all the good\r\nproperties which a hive ought to possess, while it is free from the\r\ncomplication, clumsiness, _vain whims_, and decidedly objectionable\r\nfeatures, which characterize most of the inventions which profess to be\r\nat all superior to the simple box, or the common chamber hive.\r\n\r\nYou may certainly claim _equal credit_ with Dzierzon for originality in\r\nobservation and discovery in the natural history of the honey bee, and\r\nfor success in deducing principles and devising a most valuable system\r\nof management from observed facts. But in _invention_, as far as\r\nneatness, compactness, and adaptation of means to ends are concerned,\r\nthe sturdy German must yield the palm to you. You will find a case of\r\nsimilar coincidence detailed in the Westminster Review for October,\r\n1852, page 267, et seq.\r\n\r\nI send you herewith some interesting statements respecting Dzierzon, and\r\nthe estimate in which his system is held in Germany.\r\n\r\n                           Very truly yours,\r\n                                       SAMUEL WAGNER.\r\n    REV. L. L. LANGSTROTH.\r\n\r\nThe following are the statements to which Mr. Wagner refers.--\r\n\r\n\"As the best test of the value of Mr. Dzierzon's system, is the\r\n_results_ which have been made to flow from it, a brief account of its\r\nrise and progress maybe found interesting. In 1835 he commenced\r\nbee-keeping in the common way, with 12 colonies--and after various\r\nmishaps, which taught him the defects of the common hives and the old\r\nmode of management, his stock was so reduced that in 1838 he had\r\nvirtually to begin anew. At this period he contrived his improved hive\r\nin its ruder form, which gave him the command over all the combs, and he\r\nbegan to experiment on the theory which observation and study had\r\nenabled him to devise. Thenceforward his progress was as rapid as his\r\nsuccess was complete and triumphant. Though he met with frequent\r\nreverses--about 70 colonies having been stolen from him, sixty destroyed\r\nby fire, and 24 by a flood--yet in 1846 his stock had increased to 360\r\ncolonies, and he realized from them that year six thousand pounds of\r\nhoney, besides several hundred weight of wax. At the same time most of\r\nthe cultivators in his vicinity who pursued the common methods, had\r\nfewer hives than they had when he commenced.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1848, a fatal pestilence, known by the name of \"foul brood,\"\r\nprevailed among his bees, and destroyed nearly all his colonies before\r\nit could be subdued--only about ten having escaped the malady, which\r\nattacked alike the old stocks and his artificial swarms. He estimates\r\nhis entire loss that year at over 500 _colonies_. Nevertheless he\r\nsucceeded so well in multiplying by artificial swarms, the few that\r\nremained healthy, that in the fall of 1851 his stock consisted of nearly\r\n400 colonies. He must, therefore, have multiplied his stocks more than\r\nthree fold each year.\"\r\n\r\nThe highly prosperous condition of his colonies is attested by the\r\nReport of the Secretary of the Annual Apiarian Convention which met in\r\nhis vicinity last spring. This Convention, the fourth which has been\r\nheld, consisted of 112 experienced and enthusiastic bee-keepers from\r\nvarious districts of Germany and neighboring countries, and among them\r\nwere some who when they assembled were strong opposers of his system.\r\n\r\nThey visited and personally examined the Apiaries of Mr. Dzierzon. The\r\nreport speaks in the very highest terms of his success, and of the\r\nmanifest superiority of his system of management. He exhibited and\r\nsatisfactorily explained to his visitors his practice and principles;\r\nand they remarked, with astonishment, the _singular docility_ of his\r\nbees, and the thorough control to which they were subjected. After a\r\nfull detail of the proceedings, the Secretary goes on to say:--\r\n\r\n\"Now that I have seen Dzierzon's method practically demonstrated, I must\r\nadmit that it is attended with fewer difficulties than I had supposed.\r\nWith his hive and system of management it would seem that bees become at\r\nonce more docile than they are in other cases. I consider his system the\r\nsimplest and best means of elevating bee-culture to a profitable\r\npursuit, and of spreading it far and wide over the land--especially as\r\nit is peculiarly adapted to districts in which the bees do not readily\r\nand regularly swarm. His eminent success in re-establishing his stock\r\nafter suffering so heavily from the devastating pestilence--in short the\r\nrecuperative power of the system demonstrates conclusively, that it\r\nfurnishes the best, perhaps the only means of reinstating bee-culture lo\r\na profitable branch of rural economy.\r\n\r\nDzierzon modestly disclaimed the idea of having attained perfection in\r\nhis hive. He dwelt rather upon the truth and importance of his _theory_\r\nand _system_ of _management_.\"\r\n\r\n_From the Leipzig Illustrated Almanac--Report on Agriculture for 1846._\r\n\r\n\"Bee culture is no longer regarded as of any importance in rural\r\neconomy.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the same for 1851, and 1853.\r\n\r\n\"Since Dzierzon's system has been made known an entire revolution in bee\r\nculture has been produced. A new era has been created for it, and\r\nbee-keepers are turning their attention to it with renewed zeal. The\r\nmerits of his discoveries are appreciated by the government, and they\r\nrecommend his system as worthy the attention of the teachers of common\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nMr. Dzierzon resides in a poor sandy district of Middle Silesia, which,\r\naccording to the common notions of Apiarians, is unfavorable to\r\nbee-culture. Yet despite of this and of various mishaps, he has\r\nsucceeded in realizing 900 dollars as the product of his bees in one\r\nseason!\r\n\r\nBy his mode of management, his bees yield, even in the poorest years,\r\nfrom 10 to 15 per cent on the capital invested, and where the colonies\r\nare produced by the Apiarian's own skill and labor they cost him only\r\nabout one-fourth the price at which they are usually valued. In ordinary\r\nseasons the profit amounts to from 30 to 50 per cent, and in very\r\nfavorable seasons from 80 to 100 per cent.\"\r\n\r\nIn communicating these facts to the public, I have several objects in\r\nview. I freely acknowledge that I take an honest pride in establishing\r\nmy claims as an independent observer; and as having matured by my own\r\ndiscoveries, the same system of bee-culture, as that which has excited\r\nso much interest in Germany; I desire also to have the testimony of the\r\ntranslator of Dzierzon to the superior merits of my hive. Mr. Wagner is\r\nextensively known as an able German scholar. He has taken all the\r\nnumbers of the Bee Journal, a monthly periodical which has been\r\npublished for more than fifteen years in Germany, and is probably more\r\nfamiliar with the state of Apiarian culture abroad, than any man in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI am anxious further to show that the great importance which I attach to\r\nmy system of management, is amply justified by the success of those who\r\nwhile pursuing the same system with inferior hives, have attained\r\nresults, which to common bee-keepers, seem almost incredible. Inventors\r\nare very prone to form exaggerated estimates of the value of their\r\nlabors; and the American public has been so often deluded with patent\r\nhives, devised by persons ignorant of the most important principles in\r\nthe natural history of the bee, and which have utterly failed to answer\r\ntheir professed objects, that they are scarcely to be blamed for\r\nrejecting every new hive as unworthy of confidence.\r\n\r\nThere is now a prospect that a Bee Journal will before long, be\r\nestablished in this country. Such a publication has long been needed.\r\nProperly conducted, it will have a most powerful influence in\r\ndisseminating information, awakening enthusiasm, and guarding the public\r\nagainst the miserable impositions to which it has so long been\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\nTwo such journals are now published monthly in Germany, one of which has\r\nbeen in existence for more than 15 years--and their wide circulation has\r\nmade thousands well acquainted with those principles, which must\r\nconstitute the foundation of any enlightened and profitable system of\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that while many of the principal facts in the physiology of\r\nthe honey bee have long been familiar to scientific observers, it has\r\nunfortunately happened that some of the most important have been widely\r\ndiscredited. In themselves they are so _wonderful_, and to those who\r\nhave not witnessed them, often _so incredible_, that it is not at all\r\nstrange that they have been rejected as fanciful conceits, or bare-faced\r\ninventions.\r\n\r\nMany persons have not the slightest idea that _every thing_ may be\r\n_seen_ that takes place in a bee-hive. But hives have for many years,\r\nbeen in use, containing only one large comb, enclosed on both sides, by\r\nglass. These hives are darkened by shutters, and when opened, the queen\r\nis exposed to observation, as well as all the other bees. Within the\r\nlast two years, I have discovered that with proper precautions, colonies\r\ncan be made to work in observing hives, without shutters, and exposed\r\ncontinually to the _full light of day_; so that observations may be made\r\nat all times, without in the least interrupting the ordinary operations\r\nof the bees. By the aid of such hives, some of the most intelligent\r\ncitizens of Philadelphia have seen in my Apiary, the queen bee\r\ndepositing her eggs in the cells, and constantly surrounded by an\r\naffectionate circle of her devoted children. They have also witnessed,\r\nwith astonishment and delight, all the steps in the mysterious process\r\nof raising queens from eggs which with the ordinary development, would\r\nhave produced only the common bees. For more than three months, there\r\nwas not a day in which some of my colonies were not engaged in making\r\nnew queens to supply the place of those taken from them, and I had the\r\npleasure of exhibiting all the facts to bee-keepers who never before\r\nfelt willing to credit them. As _all_ my hives are so made that each\r\ncomb can be taken out, and examined at pleasure, those who use them, can\r\nobtain from them all the information which they need, and, are no longer\r\nforced to take any thing upon trust.\r\n\r\nMay I be permitted to express the hope that the time is now at hand,\r\nwhen the number of practical observers will be so multiplied, that\r\nignorant and designing men will neither be able to impose their conceits\r\nand falsehoods upon the public, nor be sustained in their attempts to\r\ndepreciate the valuable discoveries of those who have devoted years of\r\nobservation and experiment to promote the advancement of Apiarian\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE HONEY BEE CAPABLE OF BEING TAMED OR DOMESTICATED TO A MOST\r\nSURPRISING DEGREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the bee had not such a necessary and yet formidable weapon both of\r\noffence and defence, multitudes would be induced to enter upon its\r\ncultivation, who are now afraid to have any thing to do with it. As the\r\nnew system of management which I have devised, seems to add to this\r\ninherent difficulty, by taking the greatest possible liberties with so\r\nirascible an insect, I deem it important to show clearly, in the very\r\noutset, how bees may be managed, so that all necessary operations may be\r\nperformed in an Apiary, without incurring any serious risk of exciting\r\ntheir anger.\r\n\r\nMany persons have been unable to control their expressions of wonder and\r\nastonishment, on seeing me open hive after hive, in my experimental\r\nApiary, in the vicinity of Philadelphia, removing the combs covered with\r\nbees, and shaking them off in front of the hives; exhibiting the queen,\r\ntransferring the bees to another hive, and, in short, dealing with them\r\nas if they were as harmless as so many flies. I have sometimes been\r\nasked if the bees with which I was experimenting, had not been\r\nsubjected to a long course of instruction, to prepare them for public\r\nexhibition; when in some cases, the very hives which I was opening,\r\ncontained swarms which had been brought only the day before, to my\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the natural history of the bee, I shall anticipate\r\nsome principles in its management, in order to prepare my readers to\r\nreceive, without the doubts which would otherwise be very natural, the\r\nstatements in my book, and to convince them that almost any one\r\nfavorably situated, may safely enjoy the pleasure and profit of a\r\npursuit, which has been most appropriately styled, \"the poetry of rural\r\neconomy;\" and that, without being made too familiar with a sharp little\r\nweapon, which can most speedily and effectually convert all the poetry\r\ninto very sorry prose.\r\n\r\nThe Creator intended the bee for the comfort of man, as truly as he did\r\nthe horse or the cow. In the early ages of the world, indeed until very\r\nrecently, honey was almost the only natural sweet; and the promise of \"a\r\nland flowing with milk and honey,\" had then a significance, the full\r\nforce of which it is difficult for us to realize. The honey bee was,\r\ntherefore, created not merely with the ability to store up its delicious\r\nnectar for its own use, but with certain properties which fitted it to\r\nbe domesticated, and to labor for man, and without which, he would no\r\nmore have been able to subject it to his control, than to make a useful\r\nbeast of burden of a lion or a tiger.\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiarities which constitutes the very foundation, not\r\nmerely of my system of management, but of the ability of man to\r\ndomesticate at all so irascible an insect, has never, to my knowledge,\r\nbeen clearly stated as a great and controlling principle. It may be thus\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\nA HONEY BEE NEVER VOLUNTEERS AN ATTACK, OR ACTS ON THE OFFENSIVE, WHEN\r\nIT IS GORGED OR FILLED WITH HONEY.\r\n\r\nThe man who first attempted to lodge a swarm of bees in an artificial\r\nhive, was doubtless agreeably surprised at the ease with which he was\r\nable to accomplish it. For when the bees are intending to swarm, they\r\nfill their honey-bags to their utmost capacity. This is wisely ordered,\r\nthat they may have materials for commencing operations immediately in\r\ntheir new habitation; that they may not starve if several stormy days\r\nshould follow their emigration; and that when they leave their hives,\r\nthey may be in a suitable condition to be secured by man.\r\n\r\nThey issue from their hives in the most peaceable mood that can well be\r\nimagined; and unless they are abused, allow themselves to be treated\r\nwith great familiarity. The hiving of bees by those who understand their\r\nnature, could almost always be conducted without the risk of any\r\nannoyance, if it were not the case that some improvident or unfortunate\r\nones occasionally come forth without the soothing supply; and not being\r\nstored with honey, are filled with the gall of the bitterest hate\r\nagainst all mankind and animal kind in general, and any one who dares to\r\nmeddle with them in particular. Such radicals are always to be dreaded,\r\nfor they must vent their spleen on something, even though they lose\r\ntheir life in the act.\r\n\r\nSuppose the whole colony, on sallying forth, to possess such a ferocious\r\nspirit; no one would ever dare to hive them, unless clad in a coat of\r\nmail, at least bee-proof, and not even then, until all the windows of\r\nhis house were closed, his domestic animals bestowed in some safe place,\r\nand sentinels posted at suitable stations, to warn all comers to look\r\nout for something almost as much to be dreaded, as a fiery locomotive\r\nin full speed. In short, if the propensity to be exceedingly\r\ngood-natured after a hearty meal, had not been given to the bee, it\r\ncould never have been domesticated, and our honey would still be\r\nprocured from the clefts of rocks, or the hollows of trees.\r\n\r\nA second peculiarity in the nature of the bee, and one of which I\r\ncontinually avail myself with the greatest success, may be thus stated.\r\n\r\nBEES CANNOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO FILL\r\nTHEMSELVES WITH LIQUID SWEETS.\r\n\r\nIt would be quite as easy for an inveterate miser to look with\r\nindifference upon a golden shower of double eagles, falling at his feet\r\nand soliciting his appropriation. If then we can contrive a way to call\r\ntheir attention to a treat of running sweets, when we wish to perform\r\nany operation which might provoke them, we may be sure they will accept\r\nit, and under its genial influence, allow us without molestation, to do\r\nwhat we please.\r\n\r\nWe must always be particularly careful not to handle them roughly, for\r\nthey will never allow themselves to be pinched or hurt without thrusting\r\nout their sting to resent such an indignity. I always keep a small\r\nwatering-pot or sprinkler, in my Apiary, and whenever I wish to operate\r\nupon a hive, as soon as the cover is taken off, and the bees exposed, I\r\nsprinkle them gently with water sweetened with sugar. They help\r\nthemselves with the greatest eagerness, and in a few moments, are in a\r\nperfectly manageable state. The truth is, that bees managed on this plan\r\nare always glad to see visitors, and you cannot look in upon them too\r\noften, for they expect at every call, to receive a sugared treat by way\r\nof a peace-offering.\r\n\r\nI can superintend a large number of hives, performing every operation\r\nthat is necessary for pleasure or profit, and yet not run the risks of\r\nbeing stung, which must frequently be incurred in attempting to manage,\r\nin the simplest way, the common hives. Those who are timid may, at\r\nfirst, use a bee-dress; though they will soon discard every thing of the\r\nkind, unless they are of the number of those to whom the bees have a\r\nspecial aversion. Such unfortunates are sure to be stung whenever they\r\nshow themselves in the vicinity of a bee-hive, and they will do well to\r\ngive the bees a very wide berth.\r\n\r\nApiarians have, for many years, employed the smoke of tobacco for\r\nsubduing their bees. It deprives them, at once, of all disposition to\r\nsting, but it ought never to be used for such a purpose. If the\r\nconstruction of the hives will not permit the bees to be sprinkled with\r\nsugar water, the smoke of burning paper or rags will answer every\r\npurpose, and the bees will not be likely to resent it; whereas when they\r\nrecover from the effect of the tobacco, they not unfrequently remember,\r\nand in no very gentle way, the operator who administered the nauseous\r\ndose.\r\n\r\nLet all your motions about your hives be gentle and slow. Accustom your\r\nbees to your presence; never crush or injure them in any operation;\r\nacquaint yourself fully with the principles of management detailed in\r\nthis treatise, and you will find that you have but little more reason to\r\ndread the sting of a bee, than the horns of your favorite cow, or the\r\nheels of your faithful horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN OR MOTHER-BEE, THE DRONES, AND THE WORKERS; WITH VARIOUS\r\nHIGHLY IMPORTANT FACTS IN THEIR NATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBees can flourish only when associated in large numbers, as a colony. In\r\na solitary state, a single bee is almost as helpless as a new-born\r\nchild; it is unable to endure even the ordinary chill of a cool summer\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nIf a strong colony of bees is examined, a short time before it swarms,\r\nthree different kinds of bees will be found in the hive.\r\n\r\n1st. A bee of peculiar shape, commonly called the _Queen Bee_.\r\n\r\n2d. Some hundreds, more or less, of large bees called _Drones_.\r\n\r\n3d. Many thousands of a smaller kind, called _Workers_ or common bees,\r\nand similar to those which are seen on the blossoms. A large number of\r\nthe cells will be found filled with honey and bee-bread; while vast\r\nnumbers contain eggs, and immature workers and drones. A few cells of\r\nunusual size, are devoted to the rearing of young queens, and are\r\nordinarily to be found in a perfect condition, only in the swarming\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe _Queen-Bee_ is the only _perfect female_ in the hive, and all the\r\neggs are laid by her. The _Drones_ are the _males_, and the _Workers_\r\nare _females_, whose ovaries or \"egg-bags\" are so _imperfectly\r\ndeveloped_ that they are incapable of breeding, and which retain the\r\ninstinct of females, only so far as to give the most devoted attention\r\nto feeding and rearing the brood.\r\n\r\nThese facts have all been demonstrated repeatedly, and are as well\r\nestablished as the most common facts in the breeding of our domestic\r\nanimals. The knowledge of them in their most important bearings, is\r\nabsolutely essential to all who expect to realize large profits from an\r\nimproved method of rearing bees. Those who will not acquire the\r\nnecessary information, if they keep bees at all, should manage them in\r\nthe old-fashioned way, which requires the smallest amount either of\r\nknowledge or skill.\r\n\r\nI am perfectly aware how difficult it is to reason with a large class of\r\nbee-keepers, some of whom have been so often imposed upon, that they\r\nhave lost all faith in the truth of any statements which may be made by\r\nany one interested in a patent hive, while others stigmatize all\r\nknowledge which does not square with their own, as \"book-knowledge,\" and\r\nunworthy the attention of practical men.\r\n\r\nIf any such read this book, let me remind them again, that all my\r\nassertions may be put to the test. So long as the interior of a hive,\r\nwas to common observers, a profound mystery, ignorant and designing men\r\nmight assert what they pleased, about what passed in its dark recesses;\r\nbut now, when all that takes place in it, can, _in a few moments_, be\r\nexposed to the _full light of day_, and every one who keeps bees, can\r\n_see and examine_ for himself, the man who attempts to palm upon the\r\ncommunity, his own conceits for facts, will speedily earn for himself,\r\nthe character both of a fool and an impostor.\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN BEE, or as she may more properly be called THE MOTHER BEE, is\r\nthe common mother of the whole colony. She reigns therefore, most\r\nunquestionably, by a divine right, as every mother is, or ought to be, a\r\nqueen in her own family. Her shape is entirely different from that of\r\nthe other bees. While she is not near so bulky as a drone, her body is\r\nlonger, and of a more _tapering_, or sugar-loaf form than that of a\r\nworker, so that she has somewhat of a wasp-like appearance. Her wings\r\nare much shorter, in proportion, than those of the drone, or worker; the\r\nunder part of her body is of a golden color, and the upper part darker\r\nthan that of the other bees. Her motions are usually slow and matronly,\r\nalthough she can, when she pleases, move with astonishing quickness.\r\n\r\nNo colony can long exist without the presence of this all-important\r\ninsect. She is just as necessary to its welfare, as the soul is to the\r\nbody, for a colony without a queen must as certainly perish, as a body\r\nwithout the spirit hasten to inevitable decay.\r\n\r\nShe is treated by the bees, as every mother ought to be, by her\r\nchildren, with the most unbounded respect and affection. A circle of her\r\nloving offspring constantly surround her, testifying, in various ways,\r\ntheir dutiful regard; offering her honey, from time to time, and always,\r\nmost politely getting out of her way, to give her a clear path when she\r\nwishes to move over the combs. If she is taken from them, as soon as\r\nthey have ascertained their loss, the whole colony is thrown into a\r\nstate of the most intense agitation; all the labors of the hive are at\r\nonce abandoned; the bees run wildly over the combs, and frequently, the\r\nwhole of them rush forth from the hive, and exhibit all the appearance\r\nof anxious search for their beloved mother. Not being able anywhere to\r\nfind her, they return to their desolate home, and by their mournful\r\ntones, reveal their deep sense of so deplorable a calamity. Their note,\r\nat such times, more especially when they first realize her loss, is of\r\na peculiarly mournful character; it sounds something like _a succession\r\nof wails on the minor key_, and can no more be mistaken by the\r\nexperienced bee-keeper, for their ordinary, happy hum, than the piteous\r\nmoanings of a sick child can be confounded, by an anxious mother, with\r\nits joyous crowings, when overflowing with health and happiness.\r\n\r\nI am perfectly aware that all this will sound to many, much more like\r\nromance than sober reality; but I have determined, in writing this book,\r\nto state facts, however wonderful, just as they are; confident that they\r\nwill, before long, be universally received, and hoping that the many\r\nwonders in the economy of the honey bee will not only excite a wider\r\ninterest in its culture, but will lead those who observe them, to adore\r\nthe wisdom of Him who gave them such admirable instincts. I cannot\r\nrefrain from quoting here, the forcible remarks of an English clergyman,\r\nwho appears to be a very great enthusiast in bee-culture.\r\n\r\n\"Every bee-keeper, if he have only a soul to appreciate the works of\r\nGod, and an intelligence of an inquisitive order, cannot fail to become\r\ndeeply interested in observing the wonderful instincts, (instincts akin\r\nto reason,) of these admirable creatures; at the same time that he will\r\nlearn many lessons of practical wisdom from their example. Having\r\nacquired a knowledge of their habits, not a bee will buzz in his ear,\r\nwithout recalling to him some of these lessons, and helping to make him\r\na wiser and a better man. It is certain that in all my experience, I\r\nnever yet met with a keeper of bees, who was not a respectable,\r\nwell-conducted member of society, and a moral, if not a religious\r\nman.[1] It is evident, on reflection, that this pursuit, if well\r\nattended to, must occupy some considerable share of a man's time and\r\nthoughts. He must be often about his bees, which will help to counteract\r\nthe baneful effect of the village inn. \"_Whoever is fond of his bees is\r\nfond of his home_,\" is an axiom of irrefragable truth, and one which\r\nought to kindle in every one's breast, a favorable regard for a pursuit\r\nwhich has the power to produce so happy an influence. The love of home\r\nis the companion of many other virtues, which, if not yet developed into\r\nactual exercise, are still only dormant, and may be roused into wakeful\r\nenergy at any moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe fertility of the queen bee has been much under-estimated by most\r\nwriters. It is truly astonishing. During the height of the breeding\r\nseason, she will often, under favorable circumstances, lay from two to\r\nthree thousand eggs, a day! In my observing hives, I have seen her lay,\r\nat the rate of six eggs a minute! The fecundity of the female of the\r\nwhite ant, is much greater than this, as she will lay as many as sixty\r\neggs a minute! but then her eggs are simply extruded from her body, to\r\nbe carried by the workers into suitable nurseries, while the queen bee\r\nherself deposits her eggs in their appropriate cells.\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE WAY IN WHICH THE EGGS OF THE QUEEN BEE ARE FECUNDATED.\r\n\r\nI come now to a subject of great practical importance, and one which,\r\nuntil quite recently, has been _attended_ with apparently insuperable\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed that the queen bee commences laying in the latter\r\npart of winter, or early in spring, and long before there are any\r\ndrones or males in the hive. (See remarks on Drones.) In what way are\r\nthese eggs impregnated? Huber, by a long course of the most\r\nindefatigable observations, threw much light upon this subject. Before\r\nstating his discoveries, I must pay my humble tribute of gratitude and\r\nadmiration, to this wonderful man. It is mortifying to every scientific\r\nnaturalist, and I might add, to every honest man acquainted with the\r\nfacts, to hear such a man as Huber abused by the veriest quacks and\r\nimposters; while others who have appropriated from his labors, nearly\r\nall that is of any value in their works, to use the words of Pope,\r\n\r\n    \"Damn with faint praise, assent with civil leer,\r\n    And without sneering, teach the rest to sneer.\"\r\n\r\nHuber, in early manhood, lost the use of his eyes. His opponents imagine\r\nthat in stating this fact, they have thrown merited discredit on all his\r\npretended discoveries. But to make their case still stronger, they\r\ndelight to assert that he saw every thing through the medium of his\r\nservant Francis Burnens, an ignorant peasant. Now this ignorant peasant\r\nwas a man of strong native intellect, possessing that indefatigable\r\nenergy and enthusiasm which are so indispensable to make a good\r\nobserver. He was a noble specimen of a self-made man, and afterwards\r\nrose to be the chief magistrate in the village where he resided. Huber\r\nhas paid the most admirable tribute to his intelligence, fidelity and\r\nindomitable patience, energy and skill.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to find, in any language, a better specimen of the\r\ntrue Baconian or _inductive_ system of reasoning, than Huber's work upon\r\nbees, and it might be studied as a model of the only true way of\r\ninvestigating nature, so as to arrive at reliable results.\r\n\r\nHuber was assisted in his investigations, not only by Burnens, but by\r\nhis own wife, to whom he was engaged before the loss of his sight, and\r\nwho nobly persisted in marrying him, notwithstanding his misfortune, and\r\nthe strenuous dissuasions of her friends. They lived for more than the\r\nordinary term of human life, in the enjoyment of uninterrupted domestic\r\nhappiness, and the amiable naturalist scarcely felt, in her assiduous\r\nattentions, the loss of his sight.\r\n\r\nMilton is believed by many, to have been a better poet, for his\r\nblindness; and it is highly probable that Huber was a better Apiarian,\r\nfor the same cause. His active and yet reflective mind demanded constant\r\nemployment; and he found in the study of the habits of the honey bee,\r\nfull scope for all his powers. All the facts observed, and experiments\r\ntried by his faithful assistants, were daily reported to him, and many\r\ninquiries were stated and suggestions made by him, which would probably\r\nhave escaped his notice, if he had possessed the use of his eyes.\r\n\r\nFew have such a command of both time and money as to enable them to\r\ncarry on, for a series of years, on a grand scale, the most costly\r\nexperiments. Apiarians owe more to Huber than to any other person. I\r\nhave repeatedly verified the most important of his observations, and I\r\ntake _the greatest delight_ in acknowledging my obligations to him, and\r\nin holding him up to my countrymen, as the PRINCE OF APIARIANS.\r\n\r\nMy Readers will pardon this digression. It would have been morally\r\nimpossible for me to write a work on bees, without saying at least as\r\nmuch as this, in vindication of Huber.\r\n\r\nI return to his discoveries on the impregnation of the Queen Bee. By a\r\nlong course of experiments most carefully conducted, he ascertained that\r\nlike many other insects, she is fecundated in the open air, and on the\r\nwing, and that the influence of this lasts for several years, and\r\nprobably for life. He could not form any satisfactory conjecture, as to\r\nthe way in which the eggs which were not yet developed in her ovaries,\r\ncould be fertilized. Years ago, the celebrated Dr. John Hunter, and\r\nothers, supposed that there must be a permanent receptacle for the male\r\nsperm, opening into the passage for the eggs called the oviduct.\r\nDzierzon, who must be regarded as one of the ablest contributors of\r\nmodern times, to Apiarian science, maintains this opinion, and states\r\nthat he has found such a receptacle filled with a fluid, resembling the\r\nsemen of the drones. He nowhere, to my knowledge, states that he ever\r\nmade microscopic examinations, so as to put the matter on the footing of\r\ndemonstration.\r\n\r\nIn January and February of 1852, I submitted several Queen Bees to Dr.\r\nJoseph Leidy of Philadelphia, for a scientific examination. I need\r\nhardly say to any Naturalist in this country, that Dr. Leidy has\r\nobtained the very highest reputation, both at home and abroad, as a\r\nskillful naturalist and microscopic anatomist. No man in this country or\r\nEurope, was more competent to make the investigations that I desired. He\r\nfound in making his dissections, a small globular sac, not larger than a\r\ngrain of mustard seed, (about 1/33 of an inch in diameter,)\r\ncommunicating with the oviduct, and filled with a whitish fluid, which\r\nwhen examined under the microscope, was found to abound in spermatozoa,\r\nor the animalculæ, which are the unmistakable characteristics of the\r\nseminal fluid. Later in the season, the same substance was compared with\r\nsome taken from the drones, and found to be exactly similar to it.\r\n\r\nThese examinations have settled, on the impregnable basis of\r\ndemonstration, the mode in which the eggs of the Queen are vivified. In\r\ndescending the oviduct to be deposited in the cells, they pass by the\r\nmouth of this seminal sac or spermatheca, and receive a portion of its\r\nfertilizing contents. Small as it is, its contents are sufficient to\r\nimpregnate hundreds of thousands of eggs. In precisely the same way,\r\nthe mother wasps and hornets are fecundated. The females alone of these\r\ninsects survive the winter, and they begin, single-handed, the\r\nconstruction of a nest, in which, at first, only a few eggs are\r\ndeposited. How could these eggs hatch, if the females which laid them,\r\nhad not been impregnated, the previous season? Dissection proves them to\r\nhave a spermatheca, similar to that of the Queen Bee.\r\n\r\nOf all who have written against Huber, no one has treated him with more\r\nunfairness, misrepresentation, and I might almost add, malignity, than\r\nHuish. He maintains that the eggs of the Queen are impregnated by the\r\ndrones, after she has deposited them in the cells, and accounts for the\r\nfact that brood is produced in the Spring, long before the existence of\r\nany drones in the hive, by asserting that these eggs were deposited and\r\nimpregnated late in the previous season, and have remained dormant, all\r\nwinter, in the hive: and yet the same writer, while ridiculing the\r\ndiscoveries of Huber, advises that all the mother wasps should be killed\r\nin the Spring, to prevent them from founding families to commit\r\ndepredations upon the bees! It never seems to have occurred to him, that\r\nthe existence of a permanently impregnated mother wasp, was just as\r\ndifficult to be accounted for, as the existence of a similarly\r\nimpregnated Queen Bee.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF RETARDED IMPREGNATION ON THE QUEEN BEE.\r\n\r\nI shall now mention a fact in the physiology of the Queen Bee, more\r\nsingular than any which has yet been related.\r\n\r\nHuber, while experimenting to ascertain how the Queen was fecundated,\r\nconfined some of his young Queens to their hives, by contracting the\r\nentrances, so that they were not able to go in search of the drones,\r\nuntil three weeks after their birth. To his amazement, these Queens\r\nwhose impregnation was thus unnaturally retarded, _never laid any eggs\r\nbut such as produced drones_!!\r\n\r\nHe tried the experiment again and again, but always with the same\r\nresult. Some Bee-Keepers, long before his time, had observed that all\r\nthe brood in a hive were occasionally drones, and of course, that such\r\ncolonies rapidly went to ruin. Before attempting any explanation of this\r\nastonishing fact, I must call the attention of the reader, to another of\r\nthe mysteries of the Bee-Hive,\r\n\r\n\r\nFERTILE WORKERS.\r\n\r\nIt has already been remarked, that the workers are proved by dissection\r\nto be females, all of which, under ordinary circumstances, are barren.\r\nOccasionally, some of them appear to be more fully developed than\r\ncommon, so as to be capable of laying eggs: these eggs, like those of\r\nQueens whose impregnation has been retarded, _always produce drones_!\r\nSometimes, when a colony has lost its Queen, these drone-laying workers\r\nare exalted to her place, and treated with equal respect and affection,\r\nby the bees. Huber ascertained that these fertile workers were generally\r\nreared in the neighborhood of the young Queens, and he thought that they\r\nreceived some particles of the peculiar food or jelly on which the\r\nQueens are reared. (See Royal Jelly.) He did not pretend to account for\r\nthe effect of retarded impregnation; and made no experiments to\r\ndetermine the facts, as to the fecundation of these fertile workers.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of Huber's work, nearly 50 years ago, no light has\r\nbeen shed upon the mysteries of drone-laying Queens and workers, until\r\nquite recently. Dzierzon appears to have been the first to ascertain the\r\ntruth on this subject; and his discovery must certainly be ranked as\r\nunfolding one of the most astonishing facts in all the range of\r\nanimated nature. This fact seems, at first view, so absolutely\r\nincredible, that I should not dare to mention it, if it were not\r\nsupported by the most indubitable evidence, and if I had not, (as I have\r\nalready observed,) determined to state all important and well\r\nascertained facts, without seeking, by any concealments, to pander to\r\nthe prejudices of conceited, and often, very ignorant Bee-Keepers.\r\n\r\nDzierzon advances the opinion that impregnation is not needed in order\r\nthat the eggs of the Queen may produce drones; but, that all impregnated\r\neggs produce females, either workers or Queens; and all unimpregnated\r\nones, males or drones! He states that he found drone-laying Queens in\r\nseveral of his hives, whose wings were so imperfect that they could not\r\nfly, and that on examination, they proved to be unfecundated. Hence he\r\nconcluded that the eggs of the Queen Bee or fertile worker, had from the\r\nprevious impregnation of the egg which produced them, sufficient\r\nvitality to produce the drone, which is a less highly organized insect,\r\nand one inferior to the Queen or workers. It had long been known, that\r\nthe Queen deposits drone eggs in the large or drone cells, and worker\r\neggs in the small or worker cells, and that she makes no mistakes.\r\nDzierzon inferred, therefore, that there was some way in which she was\r\nable to decide as to the sex of the egg before it was laid, and that she\r\nmust have a control over the mouth of the seminal sac, so as to be able\r\nto extrude her eggs, allowing them to receive or not, just as she\r\npleased, a portion of its fertilizing contents. In this way he thought\r\nshe determined the sex, according to the size of the cells in which she\r\nlaid them. Mr. Samuel Wagner of York, Pa., has recently communicated to\r\nme a very original and exceedingly ingenious theory of his own, which he\r\nthinks will account for all the facts without admitting that the Queen\r\nBee has any special knowledge or will on the subject. He supposes that\r\nwhen she deposits her eggs in the worker cells, her body is slightly\r\ncompressed by the size of the cells, and that the eggs, as they pass the\r\nspermatheca, receive in this manner, its vivifying influence. On the\r\ncontrary, when she is egg-laying in drone cells, this compression cannot\r\ntake place, the mouth of the spermatheca is kept closed, and the eggs\r\nare, necessarily, unfecundated. This theory may prove to be true, but at\r\npresent, it is encumbered with some difficulties and requires further\r\ninvestigation, before it can be considered as fully established.\r\n\r\nLeaving then the question whether the Queen exercises any volition in\r\nthis matter, for the present undecided, I shall state some facts which\r\noccurred in the summer of 1852, in my own Apiary, and shall then\r\nendeavor to relieve, as far as possible, this intricate subject from\r\nsome of the difficulties which embarrass it.\r\n\r\nIn the Autumn of 1852, my assistant found, in one of my hives, a young\r\nQueen, the whole of whose progeny was drones. The colony had been formed\r\nby removing part of the combs containing bees, brood and eggs from\r\nanother hive. It had only a few combs, and but a small number of bees.\r\nThey raised a new Queen in the manner which will hereafter be\r\nparticularly described. This Queen had laid a number of eggs in one of\r\nthe combs, and the young bees from some of them were already emerging\r\nfrom the cells. I perceived, at the first glance, that they were drones.\r\nAs there were none but worker cells in the hive, they were reared in\r\nthem, and not having space for full development, they were dwarfed in\r\nsize, although the bees, in order to give them more room, had pieced out\r\nthe cells so as to make them larger than usual! Size excepted, they\r\nappeared as perfect as any other drones.\r\n\r\nI was not only struck with the singularity of finding drones reared in\r\nworker cells, but with the equally singular fact that a young Queen, who\r\nat first lays only the eggs of workers, should be laying drone eggs at\r\nall; and at once conjectured that this was a case of a drone-laying,\r\nunimpregnated Queen, as sufficient time had not elapsed for her\r\nimpregnation to be unnaturally retarded. I saw the great importance of\r\ntaking all necessary precautions to determine this point. The Queen was\r\nremoved from the hive, and carefully examined. Her wings, although they\r\nappeared to be perfect, were so paralized that she could not fly. It\r\nseemed probable, therefore, that she had never been able to leave the\r\nhive for impregnation.\r\n\r\nTo settle the question beyond the possibility of doubt, I submitted this\r\nQueen to Dr. Joseph Leidy for microscopic examination. The following is\r\nan extract from his report: \"The ovaries were filled with eggs; the\r\npoison sac was full of fluid, and I took the whole of it into my mouth;\r\nthe poison produced a strong metallic taste, lasting for a considerable\r\ntime, and at first, it was pungent to the tip of the tongue. The\r\nspermatheca was distended with a perfectly colorless, transparent,\r\nviscid liquid, _without a trace of spermatozoa_.\"\r\n\r\nThis examination seems perfectly to sustain the theory of Dzierzon, and\r\nto demonstrate that Queens do not need to be impregnated, in order to\r\nlay the eggs of males.\r\n\r\nI must confess that very considerable doubts rested on my mind, as to\r\nthe accuracy of Dzierzon's statements on this subject, and chiefly\r\nbecause of his having hazarded the unfortunate conjecture that the place\r\nof the poison bag in the worker, is occupied in the Queen, by the\r\nspermatheca. Now this is so completely contrary to fact, that it was a\r\nvery natural inference that this acute and thoroughly honest observer,\r\nmade no microscopic dissections of the insects which he examined. I\r\nconsider myself peculiarly fortunate in having enjoyed the benefit of\r\nthe labors of a Naturalist, so celebrated as Dr. Leidy, for microscopic\r\ndissections. The exceeding minuteness of some of the insects which he\r\nhas completely figured and described, almost passes belief.\r\n\r\nOn examining this same colony a few days later, I obtained the most\r\nsatisfactory evidence that these drone eggs were laid by the Queen which\r\nhad been removed. No fresh eggs had been deposited in the cells, and the\r\nbees, on missing her, had commenced the construction of royal cells, to\r\nrear if possible, another Queen, a thing which they would not have done,\r\nif a fertile worker had been present, by which the drone eggs had been\r\nlaid.\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting fact proves that _all_ the eggs laid by this\r\nQueen, were drone eggs. Two of the royal cells were, in a short time,\r\ndiscontinued, and were found to be empty, while a third contained a\r\nworm, which was sealed over the usual way, to undergo its changes from a\r\nworm to a perfect Queen.\r\n\r\nI was completely at a loss to account for this, as the bees having an\r\nunimpregnated drone-laying Queen, ought not to have had a single female\r\negg from which they could rear a Queen.\r\n\r\nAt first I imagined that they might have _stolen_ it from another hive,\r\nbut when I opened this cell, it contained, instead of a queen, _a dead\r\ndrone_!\r\n\r\nI then remembered that Huber has described the same mistake on the part\r\nof some of his bees. At the base of this cell, was an extraordinary\r\nquantity of the peculiar jelly or paste, which is fed to the young that\r\nare to be transformed into queens. The poor bees in their desperation,\r\nappear to have dosed the unfortunate drone to death: as though they\r\nexpected by such liberal feeding, to produce some hopeful change in his\r\nsexual organization!\r\n\r\nIt appears to me that these facts constitute all the links in a perfect\r\nchain, and demonstrate beyond the possibility of doubt, that\r\nunfecundated queens are not only capable of laying eggs, (this would be\r\nno more remarkable than the same occurrence in a hen,) but that these\r\neggs are possessed of sufficient vitality to produce drones. Aristotle,\r\nwho flourished before the Christian era, had noticed that there was no\r\ndifference in appearance, between the eggs producing drones and those\r\nproducing workers; and he states that drones only are produced in hives\r\nwhich have no queen; of course the eggs producing them, were laid by\r\nfertile workers. Having now the aid of powerful microscopes, we are\r\nstill unable to detect the slightest difference in size or appearance in\r\nthe eggs, and this is precisely what we should expect if the same egg\r\nwill produce either a worker or a drone, according as it is or is not\r\nimpregnated. The theory which I propose, will, I think, perfectly\r\nharmonize with all the observed facts on this subject.\r\n\r\nI believe that after fecundation has been delayed for about three weeks,\r\nthe mouth of the spermatheca becomes permanently closed, so that\r\nimpregnation can no longer be effected; just as the parts of a flower,\r\nafter a certain time, wither and shut up, and the plant is incapable of\r\nfructification. The fertile drone-laying workers, are in my opinion,\r\nphysically incapable of being impregnated. However strange it may\r\nappear, or even improbable, that an unimpregnated egg can give birth to\r\na living being, or that the sex can be dependent on impregnation, we are\r\nnot at liberty to reject facts, because we cannot comprehend the reasons\r\nof them. He who allows himself to be guilty of such folly, if he seeks\r\nto maintain his consistency, will be plunged, sooner or later, into the\r\ndreary gulf of atheism. Common sense, philosophy and religion alike\r\nteach us to receive all undoubted facts in the natural and the\r\nspiritual world, with becoming reverence; assured that however\r\nmysterious to us, they are all most beautifully harmonious and\r\nconsistent in the sight of Him whose \"understanding is infinite.\"\r\n\r\nThere is something analogous to these wonders in the bee, in what takes\r\nplace in the aphides or green lice which infest our rose bushes and\r\nother plants. We have the most undoubted evidence that a fecundated\r\nfemale gives birth to other females, and they in turn to others still,\r\nall of which, without impregnation, are able to bring forth young, until\r\nat length, after a number of generations, perfect males and females are\r\nproduced, and the series starts anew!\r\n\r\nThe unequaled facilities, furnished by my hives, have seemed to render\r\nit peculiarly incumbent on me, to do all in my power to clear up the\r\ndifficulties in this intricate and yet highly important branch of\r\nApiarian knowledge. All the leading facts in the breeding of bees ought\r\nto be as well known to the bee keeper, as the same class of facts in the\r\nrearing of his domestic animals. A few crude and hasty notions, but half\r\nunderstood and half digested, will answer only for the old fashioned bee\r\nkeeper, who deals in the brimstone matches. He who expects to conduct\r\nbee keeping on a safe and profitable system, must learn that on this, as\r\non all other subjects, \"knowledge is power.\"\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary fertility of the queen bee has already been noticed.\r\nThe process of laying has been well described by the Rev. W. Dunbar, a\r\nScotch Apiarian.\r\n\r\n\"When the queen is about to lay, she puts her head into a cell, and\r\nremains in that position for a second or two, to ascertain its fitness\r\nfor the deposit which she is about to make. She then withdraws her\r\nhead, and curving her body downwards,[2] inserts the lower part of it\r\ninto the cell: in a few seconds she turns half round upon herself and\r\nwithdraws, leaving an egg behind her. When she lays a considerable\r\nnumber, she does it equally on each side of the comb, those on the one\r\nside being as exactly opposite to those on the other as the relative\r\nposition of the cells will admit. The effect of this is to produce the\r\nutmost possible concentration and economy of heat for developing the\r\nvarious changes of the brood!\"\r\n\r\nHere as at every step in the economy of the bee our minds are filled\r\nwith admiration as we witness the perfect adaptation of means to ends.\r\nWho can blame the warmest enthusiasm of the Apiarian in view of a\r\nsagacity which seems scarcely inferior to that of man.\r\n\r\n\"The eggs of bees,\" I quote from the admirable treatise of Bevan, \"are\r\nof a lengthened oval shape, with a slight curvature, and of a bluish\r\nwhite color: being besmeared at the time of laying, with a glutinous\r\nsubstance,[3] they adhere to the bases of the cells, and remain\r\nunchanged in figure or situation for three or four days; they are then\r\nhatched, the bottom of each cell presenting to view a small white worm.\r\nOn its growing so as to touch the opposite angle of the cell, it coils\r\nitself up, to use the language of Swammerdam, like a dog when going to\r\nsleep; and floats in a whitish transparent fluid, which is deposited in\r\nthe cells by the nursing-bees, and by which it is probably nourished; it\r\nbecomes gradually enlarged in its dimensions, till the two extremities\r\ntouch one another and form a ring. In this state it is called a larva or\r\nworm. So nicely do the bees calculate the quantity of food which will be\r\nrequired, that none remains in the cell when it is transformed to a\r\nnymph. It is the opinion of many eminent naturalists that farina does\r\nnot constitute the sole food of the larva, but that it consists of a\r\nmixture of farina, honey and water, partly digested in the stomachs of\r\nthe nursing-bees.\"\r\n\r\n\"The larva having derived its support, in the manner above described,\r\nfor four, five or six days, according to the season,\" (the development\r\nbeing retarded in cool weather, and badly protected hives,) \"continues\r\nto increase during that period, till it occupies the whole breadth and\r\nnearly the length of the cell. The nursing bees now seal over the cell,\r\nwith a light _brown cover_, externally more or less _convex_, (the cap\r\nof a drone cell is more convex than that of a worker,) and thus\r\ndiffering from that of a honey cell which is _paler_ and somewhat\r\n_concave_.\" The cap of the brood cell appears to be made of a mixture of\r\nbee-bread and wax; it is not air tight as it would be if made of wax\r\nalone; but when examined with a microscope it appears to be reticulated,\r\nor full of fine holes through which the enclosed insect can have air for\r\nall necessary purposes. From its texture and shape it is easily thrust\r\noff by the bee when mature, whereas, if it consisted wholly of wax, the\r\nyoung bee would either perish for lack of air, or be unable to force its\r\nway into the world! Both the material and shape of the lids which seal\r\nup the honey cells are different, because an entirely different object\r\nwas aimed at; they are of pure wax to make them air tight and thus to\r\nprevent the honey from souring or candying in the cells! They are\r\nconcave or hollowed inwards to give them greater strength to resist the\r\npressure of their contents!\r\n\r\nTo return to Bevan. \"The larva is no sooner perfectly inclosed than it\r\nbegins to line the cell by spinning round itself, after the manner of\r\nthe silk worm, a whitish silky film or cocoon, by which it is encased,\r\nas it were, in a pod. When it has undergone this change, it has usually\r\nborne the name of _nymph_ or _pupa_. The insect has now attained its\r\nfull growth, and the large amount of nutriment which it has taken serves\r\nas a store for developing the perfect insect.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _working bee nymph_ spins its cocoon in thirty-six hours. After\r\npassing about three days in this state of preparation for a new\r\nexistence, it gradually undergoes so great a change as not to wear a\r\nvestige of its previous form, but becomes armed with a firmer mail, and\r\nwith scales of a dark brown hue. On its belly six rings become\r\ndistinguishable, which by slipping one over another enables the bee to\r\nshorten its body whenever it has occasion to do so.\r\n\r\n\"When it has reached the twenty-first day of its existence, counting\r\nfrom the moment the egg is laid, it comes forth a perfect winged insect.\r\nThe cocoon is left behind, and forms a closely attached and exact lining\r\nto the cell in which it was spun; by this means the breeding cells\r\nbecome smaller and their partitions stronger, the oftener they change\r\ntheir tenants; and may become so much diminished in size as not to admit\r\nof the perfect development of full sized bees.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such are the respective stages of the working bee: those of the royal\r\nbee are as follows: she passes three days in the egg and is five a worm;\r\nthe workers then close her cell, and she immediately begins spinning her\r\ncocoon, which occupies her twenty four hours. On the tenth and eleventh\r\ndays and a part of the twelfth, as if exhausted by her labor, she\r\nremains in complete repose. Then she passes four days and a part of the\r\nfifth as a nymph. It is on the sixteenth day therefore that the perfect\r\nstate of queen is attained.\"\r\n\r\n\"The drone passes three days in the egg, six and a half as a worm, and\r\nchanges into a perfect insect on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth day\r\nafter the egg is laid.\"\r\n\r\n\"The _development_ of _each species_ likewise proceeds more slowly when\r\nthe colonies are weak or the air cool, and when the weather is very cold\r\nit is entirely suspended. Dr. Hunter has observed that the eggs, worms\r\nand nymphs all require a heat above 70° of Fahrenheit for their\r\nevolution.\"\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on protection against extremes of _heat_ and _cold_, I\r\nhave dwelt, at some length, upon the importance of constructing the\r\nhives in such a manner as to enable the bees to preserve, as far as\r\npossible, a uniform temperature in their tenement. In thin hives exposed\r\nto the sun, the heat is sometimes so great as to destroy the eggs and\r\nthe larvæ, even when the combs escape from being melted; and the cold is\r\noften so severe as to check the development of the brood, and sometimes\r\nto kill it outright.\r\n\r\nIn such hives, when the temperature out of doors falls suddenly and\r\nseverely, the bees at once feel the unfavorable change; they are obliged\r\nin self defence to huddle together to keep warm, and thus large portions\r\nof the brood comb are often abandoned, and the brood either destroyed at\r\nonce by the cold, or so enfeebled that they never recover from the\r\nshock. Let every bee keeper, in all his operations, remember that brood\r\ncomb must never be exposed to a low temperature so as to become chilled:\r\nthe disastrous effects are almost as certain, as when the eggs of a\r\nsetting hen are left, for too long a time, by the careless mother. The\r\nbrood combs are never safe when taken for any considerable time from the\r\nbees, unless the temperature is fully up to summer heat.\r\n\r\n\"[4]The young bees break their envelope with their teeth, and assisted,\r\nas soon as they come forth, by the older ones, proceed to cleanse\r\nthemselves from the moisture and exuviæ with which they were surrounded.\r\nBoth drones and workers on emerging from the cell are, at first grey,\r\nsoft and comparatively helpless so that some time elapses before they\r\ntake wing.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to the cocoons spun by the different larvæ, both workers\r\nand drones spin _complete cocoons_, or inclose themselves on every side;\r\nroyal larvæ construct only _imperfect cocoons_, open behind, and\r\nenveloping only the head, thorax, and first ring of the abdomen; and\r\nHuber concludes, without any hesitation, that the final cause of their\r\nforming only incomplete cocoons is, that they may thus be exposed to the\r\nmortal sting of the first hatched queen, whose instinct leads her\r\ninstantly to seek the destruction of those who would soon become her\r\nrivals.\r\n\r\n\"If the royal larvæ spun complete cocoons, the stings of the queens\r\nseeking to destroy their rivals might be so entangled in their meshes\r\nthat they could not be disengaged. 'Such,' says Huber, 'is the\r\ninstinctive enmity of young queens to each other, that I have seen one\r\nof them, immediately on its emergence from the cell, rush to those of\r\nits sisters, and tear to pieces even the imperfect larvæ. Hitherto\r\nphilosophers have claimed our admiration of nature for her care in\r\npreserving and multiplying the species. But from these facts we must now\r\nadmire her precautions in exposing certain individuals to a mortal\r\nhazard.'\"\r\n\r\nThe cocoon of the royal larva is very much stronger and coarser than\r\nthat spun by the drone or worker, its texture considerably resembling\r\nthat of the silk worm's. The young queen does not come forth from her\r\ncell until she is quite mature; and as its great size gives her abundant\r\nroom to exercise her wings she is capable of flying as soon as she quits\r\nit. While still in her cell she makes the fluttering and piping noises\r\nwith which every observant bee keeper is so well acquainted.\r\n\r\nSome Apiarians have supposed that the queen bee has the power to\r\nregulate the development of eggs in her ovaries, so that few or many are\r\nproduced, according to the necessities of the colony. This is evidently\r\na mistake. Her eggs, like those of the domestic hen, are formed without\r\nany volition of her own, and when fully developed, must be extruded. If\r\nthe weather is unfavorable, or if the colony is too feeble to maintain\r\nsufficient heat, a smaller number of eggs are developed in her ovaries,\r\njust as unfavorable circumstances diminish the number of eggs laid by\r\nthe hen; if the weather is very cold, egg-laying usually ceases\r\naltogether. In the latitude of Philadelphia, I opened one of my hives on\r\nthe 5th day of February, and found an abundance of eggs and brood,\r\nalthough the winter had been an unusually cold one, and the temperature\r\nof the preceding month very low. The fall of 1852 was a warm one, and\r\neggs and brood were found in a hive which I examined on the 21st of\r\nOctober. Powerful stocks in well protected hives contain some brood, at\r\nleast ten months in the year; in warm countries, bees probably breed,\r\nevery month in the year.\r\n\r\nIt is highly interesting to see in what way the supernumerary eggs of\r\nthe queen are disposed of. When the number of workers is too small to\r\ntake charge of all her eggs, or when there is a deficiency of bee bread\r\nto nourish the young, (See chapter on Pollen,) or when, for any reason,\r\nshe judges it not best to deposit them in cells, she stands upon a comb,\r\nand simply extrudes them from her oviduct, and the workers devour them\r\nas fast as they are laid! This I have repeatedly witnessed in my\r\nobserving hives, and admired the sagacity of the queen in economizing\r\nher necessary work after this fashion, instead of laboriously depositing\r\nthe eggs in cells where they are not wanted. What a difference between\r\nher wise management and the stupidity of a hen obstinately persisting to\r\nset upon addled eggs, or pieces of chalk, and often upon nothing at all.\r\n\r\nThe workers eat up also all the eggs which are dropped, or deposited out\r\nof place by the queen; in this way, nothing goes to waste, and even a\r\ntiny egg is turned to some account. Was there ever a better comment upon\r\nthe maxim? \"Take care of the pence, and the pounds will take care of\r\nthemselves.\"\r\n\r\nDo the workers who appear to be so fond of a tit-bit in the shape of a\r\nnew laid egg, ever experience a struggle between their appetites and the\r\nclaims of duty, and does it cost them some self denial to refrain from\r\nmaking a breakfast on a fresh laid egg? It is really very difficult for\r\none who has carefully watched the habits of bees, to speak of his little\r\nfavorites in any other way than as though they possessed an intelligence\r\nalmost, if not quite, akin to reason.\r\n\r\nIt is well known to every breeder of poultry, that the fertility of a\r\nhen decreases with age, until at length, she becomes entirely barren; it\r\nis equally certain that the fertility of the queen bee ordinarily\r\ndiminishes after she has entered upon her third year. She sometimes\r\nceases to lay Worker eggs, a considerable time before she dies of old\r\nage; the contents of the spermatheca are exhausted; the eggs can no\r\nlonger be impregnated and must therefore produce drones.\r\n\r\nThe queen bee usually dies of old age, some time in her fourth year,\r\nalthough instances are on record of some having survived a year longer.\r\nIt is highly important to the bee keeper who would receive the largest\r\nreturns from his bees, to be able, as in my hives, to catch the queen\r\nand remove her, when she has passed the period of her greatest\r\nfertility. In the sequel, full directions will be given, as to the\r\nproper time and mode of effecting it.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding farther in the natural history of the queen bee, I\r\nshall describe more particularly, the other inmates of the hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DRONES OR MALE BEES.\r\n\r\nThe drones are, unquestionably, the male bees. Dissection proves that\r\nthey have the appropriate organs of generation. They are much larger and\r\nstouter than either the queen or workers; although their bodies are not\r\nquite so long as that of the queen. They have no sting with which to\r\ndefend themselves; no proboscis which is suitable for gathering honey\r\nfrom the flowers, and no baskets on their thighs for holding the\r\nbee-bread. They are thus physically disqualified for work, even if they\r\nwere ever so well disposed to it. Their proper office is to impregnate\r\nthe young queens, and they are usually destroyed by the bees, soon after\r\nthis is completed.\r\n\r\nDr. Evans the author of a beautiful poem on bees thus appropriately\r\ndescribes them:--\r\n\r\n            \"Their short proboscis sips\r\n    No luscious nectar from the wild thyme's lips,\r\n    From the lime's leaf no amber drops they steal,\r\n    Nor bear their grooveless thighs the foodful meal:\r\n    On other's toils in pamper'd leisure thrive\r\n    The lazy fathers of the industrious hive.\"\r\n\r\nThe drones begin to make their appearance in April or May; earlier or\r\nlater, according to climate and the forwardness of the season, and\r\nstrength of the stock. They require about twenty-four days for their\r\nfull development from the egg. In colonies which are too weak to swarm,\r\nnone, as a general rule, are reared: they are not needed, for in such\r\nhives, as no young queens are raised, they would be only useless\r\nconsumers.\r\n\r\nThe number of drones in a hive is often very great, amounting, not\r\nmerely to hundreds, but sometimes to thousands. It seems, at first, very\r\ndifficult to understand why there should be so many, especially since it\r\nhas been ascertained that a single one will impregnate a queen for life.\r\nBut as intercourse always takes place high in the air, the young queens\r\nare obliged to leave the hive for this purpose; and it is exceedingly\r\nimportant to their safety, that they should be sure of finding one,\r\nwithout being compelled to make frequent excursions. Being larger than a\r\nworker, and less quick on the wing, they are more exposed to be caught\r\nby birds, or blown down and destroyed by sudden gusts of wind.\r\n\r\nIn a large Apiary, a few drones in each hive, or the number usually\r\nfound in one, might be amply sufficient. But it must be borne in mind,\r\nthat under these circumstances, bees are not in a state of nature.\r\nBefore they were domesticated, a colony living in a forest, often had no\r\nneighbors for miles. Now a good stock in our climate, sometimes sends\r\nout three or more swarms, and in the tropical climates, of which the bee\r\nis a native, they increase with astonishing rapidity. At Sydney, in\r\nAustralia, a single colony is stated to have multiplied to 300 in three\r\nyears. All the new swarms except the first, are led off by a young\r\nqueen, and as she is never impregnated until after she has been\r\nestablished as the head of a separate family, it is important that they\r\nshould all be accompanied by a goodly number of drones; and this\r\nrenders it necessary that a large number should be produced in the\r\nparent hive.\r\n\r\nAs this necessity no longer exists, when the bee is domesticated, the\r\nproduction of so many drones should be discouraged. Traps have been\r\ninvented to destroy them, but it is much better to save the bees the\r\nlabor and expense of rearing such a host of useless consumers. This can\r\nreadily be done by the use of my hives. The cells in which the drones\r\nare reared, are much larger than those appropriated to the raising of\r\nworkers. The combs containing them may be taken out, to have their\r\nplaces supplied with worker's cells, and thus the over production of\r\ndrones may easily be prevented. Some colonies contain so much drone comb\r\nas to be nearly worthless.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that some of my readers will object to this mode of\r\nmanagement as interfering with nature: but let them remember that the\r\nbee is not in a state of nature, and that the same objection might be\r\nurged against killing off the super-numerary males of our domestic\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nIn July or August, soon after the swarming season is over, the bees\r\nexpel the drones from the hive. They sometimes sting them, and sometimes\r\ngnaw the roots of their wings, so that when driven from the hive, they\r\ncannot return. If not treated in either of these summary ways, they are\r\nso persecuted and starved, that they soon perish. The hatred of the bees\r\nextends even to the young which are still unhatched: they are\r\nmercilessly pulled from the cells, and destroyed with the rest. How\r\nwonderful that instinct which teaches the bees that there is no longer\r\nany occasion for the services of the drones, and which impels them to\r\ndestroy those members of the colony, which, a short time before, they\r\nreared with such devoted attention!\r\n\r\nA colony which neglects to expel its drones at the usual season, ought\r\nalways to be examined. The queen is probably either diseased or dead. In\r\nmy hives, such an examination may be easily made, the true state of the\r\ncase ascertained, and the proper remedies at once applied. (See Chapter\r\non the Loss of the Queen.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRODUCTION OF SO MANY DRONES NECESSARY, IN A STATE OF NATURE, TO\r\nPREVENT DEGENERACY FROM \"IN AND IN BREEDING.\"\r\n\r\nI have often been able, by the reasons previously assigned, to account\r\nfor the necessity of such a large number of drones in a state of nature,\r\nto the satisfaction of others, but never fully to my own. I have\r\nrepeatedly queried, why impregnation might not just as well have been\r\neffected _in the hive_, as on the wing, in the open air. Two very\r\nobvious and highly important advantages would have resulted from such an\r\narrangement. 1st. A few dozen drones would have amply sufficed for the\r\nwants of any colony, even if, (as in tropical climates,) it swarmed half\r\na dozen times or oftener, in the same season. 2d. The young queens would\r\nhave been exposed to none of those risks which they now incur, in\r\nleaving the hive for fecundation.\r\n\r\nI was unable to show how the existing arrangement is best; although I\r\nnever doubted that there must be a satisfactory reason for this seeming\r\nimperfection. To suppose otherwise, would be highly unphilosophical,\r\nsince we constantly see, as the circle of our knowledge is enlarged,\r\nmany mysteries in nature hitherto inexplicable, fully cleared up.\r\n\r\nLet me here ask if the disposition which too many students of nature\r\ncherish, to reject some of the doctrines of revealed religion, is not\r\nequally unphilosophical. Neither our ignorance of all the facts\r\nnecessary to their full elucidation, nor our inability to harmonize\r\nthese facts in their mutual relations and dependencies, will justify us\r\nin rejecting any truth which God has seen fit to reveal, either in the\r\nbook of nature, or in His holy word. The man who would substitute his\r\nown speculations for the divine teachings, has embarked, without rudder\r\nor chart, pilot or compass, upon the uncertain ocean of theory and\r\nconjecture; unless he turns his prow from its fatal course, no Sun of\r\nRighteousness will ever brighten for him the dreary expanse of waters;\r\nstorms and whirlwinds will thicken in gloom, on his \"voyage of life,\"\r\nand no favoring gales will ever waft his shattered bark to a peaceful\r\nhaven.\r\n\r\nThe thoughtful reader will require no apology for the moralizing strain\r\nof many of my remarks, nor blame a clergyman, if forgetting sometimes to\r\nspeak as the mere naturalist, he endeavors to find,\r\n\r\n    \"Tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,\r\n    _Sermons_ in '_bees_,' and 'GOD' in every thing.\"\r\n\r\nTo return to the point from which I have digressed; a new attempt to\r\naccount for the existence of so many drones. If a farmer persists in\r\nwhat is called \"breeding in and in,\" that is, from the same stock\r\nwithout changing the blood, it is well known that a rapid degeneracy is\r\nthe inevitable consequence. This law extends, as far as we know, to all\r\nanimal life, and even man is not exempt from its influence. Have we any\r\nreason to suppose that the bee is an exception? or that ultimate\r\ndegeneracy would not ensue, unless some provision was made to counteract\r\nthe tendency to in and in breeding? If fecundation had taken place in\r\nthe hive, the queen bee must of necessity, have been impregnated by\r\ndrones from a common parent, and the same result must have taken place\r\nin each successive generation, until the whole species would eventually\r\nhave \"run out.\" By the present arrangement, the young females, when they\r\nleave the hive, often find the air swarming with drones, many of which\r\nbelong to other colonies, and thus by crossing the breed, a provision is\r\nconstantly made to prevent deterioration.\r\n\r\nExperience has proved not only that it is unnecessary to impregnation\r\nthat there should be drones in the colony of the young queen, but that\r\nthis may be effected even when there are no drones in the Apiary, and\r\nnone except at some considerable distance. Intercourse takes place very\r\nhigh in the air, (perhaps that less risk may be incurred from birds,)\r\nand this is the more favorable to the continual crossing of stocks.\r\n\r\nI am strongly persuaded that the decay of many flourishing stocks, even\r\nwhen managed with great care, is to be attributed to the fact that they\r\nhave become enfeebled by \"close breeding,\" and are thus unable to resist\r\nthe injurious influences which were comparatively harmless when the bees\r\nwere in a state of high physical vigor. I shall, in the chapter on\r\nArtificial Swarming, explain in what way, by the use of my hives, the\r\nstock of bees may be easily crossed, when a cultivator is too remote\r\nfrom other Apiaries, to depend upon its being naturally effected.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WORKERS OR COMMON BEES.\r\n\r\nThe number of workers in a hive varies very much. A good swarm ought to\r\ncontain 15,000 or 20,000; and in large hives, strong colonies which are\r\nnot reduced by swarming, frequently number two or three times as many,\r\nduring the height of the breeding season. We have well-authenticated\r\ninstances of stocks much more populous than this. The Polish hives will\r\nhold several bushels, and yet we are informed by Mr. Dohiogost, that\r\nthey swarm regularly, and that the swarms are so powerful that \"they\r\nresemble a little cloud in the air.\" I shall hereafter consider how the\r\nsize of the hive affects the number of bees that it may be expected to\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nThe workers, (as has been already stated,) are all females whose ovaries\r\nare too imperfectly developed to admit of their laying eggs. For a long\r\ntime, they were regarded as neither males nor females, and were called\r\nNeuters; but more careful microscopic examinations have enabled us to\r\ndetect the rudiments of their ovaries, and thus to determine their sex.\r\nThe accuracy of these examinations has been verified by the well-known\r\nfacts respecting _fertile workers_.\r\n\r\nRiem, a German Apiarian, first discovered that workers sometimes lay\r\neggs. Huber, in the course of his investigations on this subject,\r\nascertained that such workers were raised in hives that had lost their\r\nqueen, and in the vicinity of the royal cells in which young queens were\r\nbeing reared. He conjectured that they received accidentally, a small\r\nportion of the peculiar food of these infant queens, and in this way, he\r\naccounted for their reproductive organs being more developed than those\r\nof other workers. Workers reared in such hives, are in close proximity\r\nto the young queens, and there is certainly much probability that some\r\nof the royal jelly may be accidentally dropped into their cells; as, in\r\nthese hives, the queen cells when first commenced are parallel to the\r\nhorizon, instead of being perpendicular to it, as they are in other\r\nhives. I do not feel confident, however, that they are not sometimes\r\nbred in hives which have not lost their queen. The kind of eggs laid by\r\nthese fertile workers, has already been noticed. Such workers are seldom\r\ntolerated in hives containing a fertile, healthy queen, though instances\r\nof this kind have been known to occur. The worker is much smaller than\r\neither the queen or the drone.[5] It is furnished with a tongue or\r\nproboscis, of the most curious and complicated structure, which, when\r\nnot in use, is nicely folded under its abdomen; with this, it licks or\r\nbrushes up the honey, which is thence conveyed to its honey-bag. This\r\nreceptacle is not larger than a very small pea, and is so perfectly\r\ntransparent, as to appear when filled, of the same color with its\r\ncontents; it is properly the first stomach of the bee, and is surrounded\r\nby muscles which enable the bee to compress it, and empty its contents\r\nthrough her proboscis into the cells. (See Chapter on Honey.)\r\n\r\nThe hinder legs of the worker are furnished with a spoon-shaped hollow\r\nor basket, to receive the pollen or bee bread which she gathers from the\r\nflowers. (See Chapter on Pollen.)\r\n\r\nEvery worker is armed with a formidable sting, and when provoked, makes\r\ninstant and effectual use of her natural weapon. The sting, when\r\nsubjected to microscopic examination, exhibits a very curious and\r\ncomplicated mechanism. \"It is moved[6] by muscles which, though\r\ninvisible to the eye, are yet strong enough to force the sting, to the\r\ndepth of one twelfth of an inch, through the thick skin of a man's hand.\r\nAt its root are situated two glands by which the poison is secreted:\r\nthese glands uniting in one duct, eject the venemous liquid along the\r\ngroove, formed by the junction of the two piercers. There are four barbs\r\non the outside of each piercer: when the insect is prepared to sting,\r\none of these piercers, having its point a little longer than the other,\r\nfirst darts into the flesh, and being fixed by its foremost beard, the\r\nother strikes in also, and they alternately penetrate deeper and deeper,\r\ntill they acquire a firm hold of the flesh with their barbed hooks, and\r\nthen follows the sheath, conveying the poison into the wound. The action\r\nof the sting, says Paley, affords an example of the union of _chemistry_\r\nand mechanism; of chemistry in respect to the _venom_, which can produce\r\nsuch powerful effects; of mechanism as the sting is a compound\r\ninstrument. The machinery would have been comparatively useless had it\r\nnot been for the chemical process, by which in the insect's body _honey_\r\nis converted into _poison_; and on the other hand, the poison would have\r\nbeen ineffectual, without an instrument to wound, and a syringe to\r\ninject it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon examining the edge of a very keen razor by the microscope, it\r\nappears as broad as the back of a pretty thick knife, rough, uneven, and\r\nfull of notches and furrows, and so far from anything like sharpness,\r\nthat an instrument, as blunt as this seemed to be, would not serve even\r\nto cleave wood. An exceedingly small needle being also examined, it\r\nresembled a rough iron bar out of a smith's forge. The sting of a bee\r\nviewed through the same instrument, showed everywhere a polish amazingly\r\nbeautiful, without the least flaw, blemish, or inequality, and ended in\r\na point too fine to be discerned.\"\r\n\r\nThe extremity of the sting being barbed like an arrow, the bee can\r\nseldom withdraw it, if the substance into which she darts it is at all\r\ntenacious. In losing her sting she parts with a portion of her\r\nintestines, and of necessity, soon perishes.\r\n\r\nAs the loss of the sting is always fatal to the bees, they pay a dear\r\npenalty for the exercise of their patriotic instincts; but they always\r\nseem ready, (except when they have taken \"a drop too much,\" and are\r\ngorged with honey,) to die in defence of their home and treasures; or as\r\nthe poet has expressed it, they\r\n\r\n    \"Deem life itself to vengeance well resign'd,\r\n    Die on the wound, and leave their sting behind.\"\r\n\r\nHornets, wasps and other stinging insects are able to withdraw their\r\nstings from the wound. I have never seen any attempt to account for the\r\nexception in the case of the honey bee. But if the Creator intended the\r\nbee for the use of man, as He most certainly did, has He not given it\r\nthis peculiarity, to make it less formidable, and therefore more\r\ncompletely subject to human control? Without a sting, it would have\r\nstood no chance of defending its tempting sweets against a host of\r\ngreedy depredators; but if it could sting a number of times, it would be\r\nmuch more difficult to bring it into a state of thorough domestication.\r\nA quiver full of arrows in the hand of a skilful marksman, is far more\r\nto be dreaded than a single shaft.\r\n\r\nThe defence of the colony against enemies, the construction of the\r\ncells, the storing of them with honey and bee-bread, the rearing of the\r\nyoung, in short, the whole work of the hive, the laying of eggs\r\nexcepted, is carried on by the industrious little workers.\r\n\r\nThere may be _gentlemen_ of leisure in the commonwealth of bees, but\r\nmost assuredly there are no such _ladies_, whether of high or low\r\ndegree. The queen herself, has her full share of duties, for it must be\r\nadmitted that the royal office is no sinecure, when the mother who fills\r\nit, must superintend daily the proper deposition of several thousand\r\neggs!\r\n\r\n\r\nAGE OF BEES.\r\n\r\nThe queen bee, (as has been already stated,) will live four, and\r\nsometimes, though very rarely, five years. As the life of the drones is\r\nusually cut short by violence, it is not easy to ascertain its precise\r\nlimit. Bevan, in some interesting statements on the longevity of bees,\r\nestimates it not to exceed four months. The workers are supposed by him,\r\nto live six or seven months. Their age depends, however, very much upon\r\ntheir greater or less exposure to injurious influences and severe\r\nlabors. Those reared in the spring and early part of summer, and on whom\r\nthe heaviest labors of the hive must necessarily devolve, do not appear\r\nto live more than two or three months, while those which are bred at the\r\nclose of summer, and early in autumn, being able to spend a large part\r\nof their time in repose, attain a much greater age. It is very evident\r\nthat \"the bee,\" (to use the words of a quaint old writer,) \"is a summer\r\nbird,\" and that with the exception of the queen, none live to be a year\r\nold.\r\n\r\nNotched and ragged wings, instead of gray hairs and wrinkled faces, are\r\nthe signs of old age in the bee, and indicate that its season of toil\r\nwill soon be over. They appear to die rather suddenly, and often spend\r\ntheir last days, and sometimes even their last hours, in useful labors.\r\nPlace yourself before a hive, and see the indefatigable energy of these\r\naged veterans, toiling along with their heavy burdens, side by side with\r\ntheir more youthful compeers, and then say if you can, that _you_ have\r\ndone work enough, and that you will give yourself up to slothful\r\nindulgence, while the ability for useful labor still remains. Let the\r\ncheerful hum of their industrious old age inspire you with better\r\nresolutions, and teach you how much nobler it is to meet death in the\r\npath of duty, striving still, as you \"have opportunity,\" to \"do good\r\nunto all men.\"\r\n\r\nThe age which individual members of the community may attain, must not\r\nbe confounded with that of the colony. Bees have been known to occupy\r\nthe same domicile for a great number of years. I have seen flourishing\r\ncolonies which were twenty years old, and the Abbe Della Rocca speaks\r\nof some over forty years old! Such cases have led to the erroneous\r\nopinion that bees are a long-lived race. But this, as Dr. Evans has\r\nobserved, is just as wise as if a stranger, contemplating a populous\r\ncity, and personally unacquainted with its inhabitants, should on paying\r\nit a second visit, many years afterwards, and finding it equally\r\npopulous, imagine that it was peopled by the same individuals, not one\r\nof whom might then be living.\r\n\r\n    \"Like leaves on trees, the race of bees is found,\r\n    Now green in youth, now withering on the ground;\r\n    Another race the Spring or Fall supplies,\r\n    They droop successive, and successive rise.\"\r\n\r\nThe cocoons spun by the larvæ, are never removed by the bees; they stick\r\nso closely to the sides of the cells, that the knowing bee well\r\nunderstands that the labor of removal would cost more than it would be\r\nworth. In process of time, the breeding cells become too small for the\r\nproper development of the young. In some cases, the bees must take down\r\nand reconstruct the old combs, for if they did not, the young issuing\r\nfrom them would always be dwarfs; whereas I once compared with other\r\nbees, those of a colony more than fifteen years old, and found no\r\nperceptible difference. That they do not always renew the old combs,\r\nmust be admitted, as the young from some old hives are often\r\nconsiderably below the average size. On this account, it is very\r\ndesirable to be able to remove the old combs occasionally, that their\r\nplace may be supplied with new ones.\r\n\r\nIt is a great mistake to imagine that the brood combs ought to be\r\nchanged every year. In my hives, they might, if it were desirable, be\r\neasily changed several times in a year: but once in five or six years is\r\noften enough; oftener than this requires a needless consumption of honey\r\nto replace them, besides being for other reasons undesirable, as the\r\nbees are always in winter, colder in new comb than in old. Inventors of\r\nhives have too often been, most emphatically \"men of one idea:\" and that\r\none, instead of being a well established and important fact in the\r\nphysiology of the bee, has frequently, (like the necessity for a yearly\r\nchange of the brood combs,) been merely a conceit, existing nowhere but\r\nin the brain of a visionary projector. This is all harmless enough,\r\nuntil an effort is made to impose such miserable crudities upon an\r\nignorant public, either in the shape of a patented hive, _or worse\r\nstill, of an UNPATENTED hive, the pretended RIGHT to use which, is\r\nFRAUDULENTLY sold to the cheated purchaser_!!\r\n\r\nFor want of proper knowledge with regard to the age of bees, huge \"bee\r\npalaces,\" and large closets in garrets or attics, have been constructed,\r\nand their proprietors have vainly imagined that the bees would fill\r\nthem, however roomy; for they can see no reason why a colony should not\r\ncontinue to increase indefinitely, until at length it numbers its\r\ninhabitants by millions or billions! As the bees can never at one time\r\nequal, still less exceed the number which the queen is capable of\r\nproducing in one season, these spacious dwellings have always an\r\nabundance of \"spare rooms.\" It seems strange that men can be thus\r\ndeceived, when often in their own Apiary, they have healthy stocks which\r\nhave not swarmed for a year or more, and which yet in the spring are not\r\na whit more populous than those which have regularly parted with\r\nvigorous swarms.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the Creator, has for some wise reason, set a limit to\r\nthe increase of numbers in a single colony; and I shall venture to\r\nassign what appears to me to have been one reason for His so doing.\r\nSuppose that He had given to the bee, a length of life as great as that\r\nof the horse or the cow, or had made each queen capable of laying\r\ndaily, some hundreds of thousands of eggs, or had given several hundred\r\nqueens to each hive, then from the Very nature of the case, a colony\r\nmust have gone on increasing, until it became a scourge rather than a\r\nbenefit to man. In the warm climates of which the bee is a native, they\r\nwould have established themselves in some cavern or capacious cleft in\r\nthe rocks, and would there have quickly become so powerful as to bid\r\ndefiance to all attempts to appropriate the avails of their labors.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated, that none, except the mother wasps and\r\nhornets, survive the winter. If these insects had been able, like the\r\nbee, to commence the season with the accumulated strength of a large\r\ncolony, long before its close, they would have proved a most intolerable\r\nnuisance. If, on the contrary, the queen bee had been compelled,\r\nsolitary and alone, to lay the foundations of a new commonwealth, the\r\nhoney-harvest would have disappeared before she could have become the\r\nparent of a numerous family.\r\n\r\nIn the laws which regulate the increase of bees as well as in all other\r\nparts of their economy, we have the plainest proofs that the insect was\r\nformed for the special service of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROCESS OF REARING THE QUEEN MORE PARTICULARLY DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\nIf in the early part of the season, the population of a hive becomes\r\nuncomfortably crowded, the bees usually make preparations for swarming.\r\nA number of royal cells are commenced, and they are placed almost always\r\nupon those edges of the combs which are not attached to the sides of the\r\nhive. These cells somewhat resemble a small ground-nut or pea-nut, and\r\nare about an inch deep, and one-third of an inch in diameter: they are\r\nvery thick, and require a large quantity of material for their\r\nconstruction. They are seldom seen in a perfect state, as the bees\r\nnibble them away after the queen has hatched, leaving only their\r\nremains, in the shape of a very small acorn-cup. While the other cells\r\nopen sideways, these always hang with their mouth _downwards_. Much\r\nspeculation has arisen as to the reason for this deviation: some have\r\nconjectured that their peculiar position exerted an influence upon the\r\ndevelopment of the royal larvæ; while others, having ascertained that no\r\ninjurious effect was produced by turning them upwards, or placing them\r\nin any other position, have considered this deviation as among the\r\ninscrutable mysteries of the bee-hive. So it always seemed to me, until\r\nmore careful reflection enabled me to solve the problem. The queen cells\r\nopen downwards, simply _to save room_! The distance between the parallel\r\nranges of comb being usually less than half an inch, the bees could not\r\nhave made the royal cells to open sideways, without sacrificing the\r\ncells opposite to them. In order to economize space, to the very utmost,\r\nthey put them upon the unoccupied edges of the comb, as the only place\r\nwhere there is always plenty of room for such very large cells.\r\n\r\nThe number of royal cells varies greatly; sometimes there are only two\r\nor three, ordinarily there are five or six, and I have occasionally seen\r\nmore than a dozen. They are not all commenced at once, for the bees do\r\nnot intend that the young queens shall all arrive at maturity, at the\r\nsame time. I do not consider it as fully settled, how the eggs are\r\ndeposited in these cells. In some few instances, I have known the bees\r\nto transfer the eggs from common to queen cells, and this _may_ be their\r\ngeneral method of procedure. I shall hazard the conjecture that the\r\nqueen deposits her eggs in cells on the edges of the comb, in a crowded\r\nstate of the hive, and that some of these are afterwards enlarged and\r\nchanged into royal cells by the workers. Such is the instinctive hatred\r\nof the queen to her own kind, that it does not seem to me probable, that\r\nshe is intrusted with even the initiatory steps for securing a race of\r\nsuccessors. That the eggs from which the young queens are produced, are\r\nof the same kind with those producing workers, has been repeatedly\r\ndemonstrated. On examining the queen cells while they are in progress,\r\none of the first things which excites our notice, is the very unusual\r\namount of attention bestowed upon them by the workers. There is scarcely\r\na second in which a bee is not peeping into them, and just as fast as\r\none is satisfied, another pops its head in, to examine if not to report,\r\nprogress. The importance of their inmates to the bee-community, might\r\neasily be inferred from their being the center of so much attraction.\r\n\r\n\r\nROYAL JELLY.\r\n\r\nThe young queens are supplied with a much larger quantity of food than\r\nis allotted to the other larvæ, so that they seem almost to float in a\r\nthick bed of jelly, and there is usually a portion of it left unconsumed\r\nat the base of the cells, after the insects have arrived at maturity. It\r\nis different from the food of either drones or workers, and in\r\nappearance, resembles a light quince jelly, having a slightly acid\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nI submitted a portion of the royal jelly for analysis, to Dr. Charles M.\r\nWetherill, of Philadelphia; a very interesting account of his\r\nexamination may be found in the proceedings of the Phila. Academy of\r\nNat. Sciences for July, 1852. He speaks of the substance as \"truly a\r\nbread-containing, albuminous compound.\" I hope in the course of the\r\ncoming summer to obtain from this able analytical chemist, an analysis\r\nof the food of the young drones and workers. A comparison of its\r\nelements with those of the royal jelly, may throw some light on subjects\r\nas yet involved in obscurity.\r\n\r\nThe effects produced upon the larvæ by this peculiar food and method of\r\ntreatment, are very remarkable. For one, I have never considered it\r\nstrange that such effects should be rejected as idle whims, by nearly\r\nall except those who have either been eye-witnesses to them, or have\r\nbeen well acquainted with the character and opportunities for accurate\r\nobservation, of those on whose testimony they have received them. They\r\nare not only in themselves most marvelously strange, but on the face of\r\nthem so entirely opposed to all common analogies, and so very\r\nimprobable, that many men when asked to believe them, feel almost as\r\nthough an insult were offered to their common sense. The most important\r\nof these effects, I shall now proceed to enumerate.\r\n\r\n1st. The peculiar mode in which the worm designed to be reared as a\r\nqueen, is treated, causes it to arrive at maturity, about one-third\r\nearlier than if it had been bred a worker. And yet it is to be much more\r\nfully developed, and according to ordinary analogy, ought to have had a\r\n_slower growth_!\r\n\r\n2d. Its organs of reproduction are completely developed, so that it is\r\ncapable of fulfilling the office of a mother.\r\n\r\n3d. Its size, shape and color are all greatly changed. (See p. 32.) Its\r\nlower jaws are shorter, its head rounder, and its legs have neither\r\nbrushes nor baskets, while its sting is more curved, and one-third\r\nlonger than that of a worker.\r\n\r\n4th. Its _instincts_ are entirely changed. Reared as a worker, it would\r\nhave been ready to thrust out its sting, upon the least provocation;\r\nwhereas now, it may be pulled limb from limb, without attempting to\r\nsting. As a worker it would have treated a queen with the greatest\r\nconsideration; whereas now, if placed under a glass with another queen,\r\nit rushes forthwith to mortal combat with its rival. As a worker, it\r\nwould frequently have left the hive, either for labor or exercise: as a\r\nqueen, after impregnation, it never leaves the hive except to accompany\r\na new swarm.\r\n\r\n5th. The term of its life is remarkably lengthened. As a worker, it\r\nwould have lived not more than six or seven months at farthest; as a\r\nqueen it may live seven or eight times as long! All these wonders rest\r\non the impregnable basis of complete demonstration, and instead of being\r\nwitnessed by only a select few, may now, by the use of my hive, be\r\nfamiliar sights to any bee keeper, who prefers to acquaint himself with\r\nfacts, rather than to cavil and sneer at the labors of others.[7]\r\n\r\nWhen provision has been made, in the manner described, for a new race of\r\nqueens, the old mother always departs with the first swarm, before her\r\nsuccessors have arrived at maturity.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL REARING OF QUEENS.\r\n\r\nThe distress of the bees when they lose their queen, has already been\r\ndescribed. If they have the means of supplying her loss, they soon calm\r\ndown, and commence forthwith, the necessary steps for rearing another.\r\nThe process of rearing queens artificially, to meet some special\r\nemergency, is even more wonderful than the natural one, which has\r\nalready been described. Its success depends on the bees having\r\nworker-eggs or worms not more than three days old; (if older, the larva\r\nhas been too far developed as a worker to admit of any change:) the bees\r\nnibble away the partitions of two cells adjoining a third, so as to make\r\none large cell out of the three. They destroy the eggs or worms in two\r\nof these cells, while they place before the occupant of the third, the\r\nusual food of the young queens, and build out its cell, so as to give it\r\nample space for development. They do not confine themselves to the\r\nattempt to rear a single queen, but to guard against failure, start a\r\nconsiderable number, although the work on all except a few, is usually\r\nsoon discontinued.\r\n\r\nIn twelve or fourteen days, they are in possession of a new queen,\r\nprecisely similar to one reared in the natural way, while the eggs which\r\nwere laid at the same time in the adjoining cells, and which have been\r\ndeveloped in the usual way, are nearly a week longer in coming to\r\nmaturity.\r\n\r\nI will give in this connection a description of an interesting\r\nexperiment:\r\n\r\nA large hive which stood at a distance from any other colony, was\r\nremoved in the morning of a very pleasant day, to a new place, and\r\nanother hive containing only empty comb, was put upon its stand.\r\nThousands of workers which were out in the fields, or which left the old\r\nhive after its removal, returned to the familiar spot. It was affecting\r\nto witness their grief and despair: they flew in restless circles about\r\nthe place which once contained their happy home, entered and left the\r\nnew hive continually, expressing, in various ways, their lamentations\r\nover their cruel bereavement. Towards evening, they ceased to take wing,\r\nand roamed in restless platoons, in and out of the hive, and over its\r\nsurface, acting all the time, as though in search of some lost treasure.\r\nI now gave them a piece of brood comb, containing worker eggs and worms,\r\ntaken from a second swarm which being just established with its young\r\nqueen, in a new hive, could have no intention of rearing young queens\r\nthat season; therefore, it cannot be contended that this piece of comb\r\ncontained what some are pleased to call \"royal eggs.\" What followed the\r\nintroduction of this brood comb, took place much quicker than it can be\r\ndescribed. The bees which first touched it, raised a peculiar note, and\r\nin a moment, the comb was covered with a dense mass; their restless\r\nmotions and mournful noises ceased, and a cheerful hum at once attested\r\ntheir delight! Despair gave place to hope, as they recognized in this\r\nsmall piece of comb, the means of deliverance. Suppose a large building\r\nfilled with thousands of persons, tearing their hair, beating their\r\nbreasts, and by piteous cries, as well as frantic gestures, giving vent\r\nto their despair; if now some one should enter this house of mourning,\r\nand by a single word, cause all these demonstrations of agony to give\r\nplace to smiles and congratulations, the change could not be more\r\nwonderful and instantaneous, than that produced when the bees received\r\nthe brood comb!\r\n\r\nThe Orientals call the honey bee, Deburrah, \"She that speaketh.\" Would\r\nthat this little insect might speak, and in words more eloquent than\r\nthose of man's device, to the multitudes who allow themselves to reject\r\nthe doctrines of revealed religion, because, as they assert, they are,\r\non their face so utterly improbable, that they labor under an _a priori_\r\nobjection strong enough to be fatal to their credibility. Do not nearly\r\nall the steps in the development of a queen from a worker-egg, labor\r\nunder precisely the same objection? and have they not, for this very\r\nreason, always been regarded by great numbers of bee keepers, as\r\nunworthy of credence? If the favorite argument of infidels and errorists\r\nwill not stand the test when applied to the wonders of the bee-hive, can\r\nit be regarded as entitled to any serious weight, when employed in\r\nframing objections against religious truths, and arrogantly taking to\r\ntask the infinite Jehovah, for what He has been pleased to do or to\r\nteach? Give me the same latitude claimed by such objectors, and I can\r\neasily prove that a man is under no obligation to receive any of the\r\nwonders in the economy of the bee-hive, although he is himself an\r\nintelligent eye-witness that they are all substantial verities.\r\n\r\nI shall quote, in this connection, from Huish, an English Apiarian of\r\nwhom I have already spoken, because his objections to the discoveries\r\nof Huber, remind me so forcibly of both the spirit and principles of the\r\ngreat majority of those who object to the doctrines of revealed\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\n\"If an individual, with the view of acquiring some knowledge of the\r\nnatural history of the bee, or of its management, consult the works of\r\nBagster, Bevan, or any of the periodicals which casually treat upon the\r\nsubject, will he not rise from the study of them with his mind\r\nsurcharged with falsities and mystification? Will he not discover\r\nthrough the whole of them a servile acquiescence in the opinions and\r\ndiscoveries of one man, however at variance they may be with truth or\r\nprobability; and if he enter upon the discussion with his mind free from\r\nprejudice, will he not experience that an outrage has been committed\r\nupon his reason, in calling upon him to give assent to positions and\r\nprinciples which at best are merely assumed, but to which he is called\r\nupon dogmatically to subscribe his acquiescence as the indubitable\r\nresults of experience, skill and ability? The editors of the works above\r\nalluded to, should boldly and indignantly have declared, that from their\r\nown experience in the natural economy of the insect, they were able to\r\npronounce the circumstances as related by Huber to be directly\r\n_impossible_, and the whole of them based on fiction and imposition.\"\r\n\r\nLet the reader change only a few words in this extract: for \"the natural\r\nhistory of the bee or its management,\" let him write, \"the subject of\r\nreligion;\" for, \"the works of Bagster, Bevan,\" &c., let him put, \"the\r\nworks of Moses, Paul,\" &c.; for, \"their own experience in the natural\r\neconomy of the insect,\" let him substitute, \"their own experience in the\r\nnature of man;\" and for, \"circumstances as related by Huber,\" let him\r\ninsert, \"as related by Luke or John,\" and it will sound almost precisely\r\nlike a passage from some infidel author.\r\n\r\nI resume the quotation from Huish; \"If we examine the account which\r\nHuber gives of his invention (!) of the royal jelly, the existence and\r\nefficacy of which are fully acquiesced in by the aforesaid editors, to\r\nwhat other conclusions are we necessarily driven, than that they are the\r\ndupes of a visionary enthusiast, whose greatest merit consists in his\r\ninventive powers, no matter how destitute those powers may be of all\r\naffinity with truth or probability? Before, however, these editors\r\nbestowed their unqualified assent on the existence of this royal jelly,\r\ndid they stop to put to themselves the following questions? By what kind\r\nof bee is it made?[9] Whence is it procured? Is it a natural or an\r\nelaborated substance? If natural, from what source is it derived? If\r\nelaborated, in what stomach of the bee is it to be found? How is it\r\nadministered? What are its constituent principles? Is its existence\r\noptional or definite? Whence does it derive its miraculous power of\r\nconverting a common egg into a royal one? Will any of the aforesaid\r\neditors publicly answer these questions? and ought they not to have been\r\nable to answer them, before they so unequivocally expressed their belief\r\nin its existence, its powers and administration?\"\r\n\r\nHow puerile does all this sound to one who has _seen_ and _tasted_ the\r\nroyal jelly! And permit me to add, how equally unmeaning do the\r\nobjections of infidels seem, to those who have an experimental\r\nacquaintance with the divine hopes and consolations of the Gospel of\r\nChrist.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The author of this work regrets that his experience does not enable\r\nhim to speak with such absolute confidence as to the character of all\r\nthe bee keepers whom he has known.\r\n\r\n[2] In this way she is sure to deposit the egg in the cell she has\r\nselected.\r\n\r\n[3] If ever there lived a genuine naturalist, Swammerdam was the man. In\r\nhis History of Insects, published in 1737, he has given a most beautiful\r\ndrawing of the ovaries of the queen bee. The sac which he supposed\r\nsecreted a fluid for sticking the eggs to the base of the cells is the\r\nseminal reservoir or spermatheca.\r\n\r\n[4] Bevan.\r\n\r\n[5] This work being intended chiefly for practical purposes, I have\r\nthought best to use, as little as possible, the technical terms and\r\nminute anatomical descriptions of the scientific entomologist.\r\n\r\n[6] Bevan.\r\n\r\n[7] Having already spoken of Swammerdam, I shall give a brief extract\r\nfrom the celebrated Dr. Boerhaave's memoir of this wonderful naturalist,\r\nwhich should put to the blush, if any thing can, the arrogance of those\r\nsuperficial observers who are too wise in their own conceit, to avail\r\nthemselves of the knowledge of others.\r\n\r\n\"This treatise on Bees proved so fatiguing a performance, that\r\nSwammerdam never afterwards recovered even the appearance of his former\r\nhealth and vigor. He was almost continually engaged by day in making\r\nobservations, and as constantly engaged by night in recording them by\r\ndrawings and suitable explanations.\"\r\n\r\n\"This being summer work, his daily labor began at six in the morning,\r\nwhen the sun afforded him light enough to survey such minute objects;\r\nand from that hour till twelve, he continued without interruption, all\r\nthe while exposed in the open air to the scorching heat of the sun,\r\nbareheaded for fear of intercepting his sight, and his head in a manner\r\ndissolving into sweat under the irresistible ardors of that powerful\r\nluminary. And if he desisted at noon, it was only because the strength\r\nof his eyes was too much weakened, by the extraordinary afflux of light\r\nand the use of microscopes, to continue any longer upon such small\r\nobjects, though as discernible in the afternoon, as they had been in the\r\nforenoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our author, the better to accomplish his vast, unlimited views, often\r\nwished for a year of perpetual heat and light to perfect his inquiries,\r\nwith a polar night to reap all the advantages of them by proper drawings\r\nand descriptions.\"\r\n\r\n[8] The formation of swarms will be particularly described in another\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n[9] Suppose that we are unable to give a satisfactory answer to any of\r\nthese questions, does our ignorance on these points disprove the _fact_\r\nof the existence of such a jelly?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCOMB.\r\n\r\n\r\nWax is a natural secretion of the bees; it may be called _their oil or\r\nfat_. If they are gorged with honey, or any liquid sweet, and remain\r\nquietly clustered together, it is formed in small wax pouches on their\r\nabdomen, and comes out in the shape of very delicate scales. Soon after\r\na swarm is hived, the bottom board will be covered with these scales.\r\n\r\n    \"Thus, filtered through yon flutterer's folded mail,\r\n    Clings the cooled wax, and hardens to a scale.\r\n    Swift, at the well known call, the ready train,\r\n    (For not a buz boon Nature breathes in vain,)\r\n    Spring to each falling flake, and bear along\r\n    Their glossy burdens to the builder throng.\r\n    These with sharp sickle or with sharper tooth,\r\n    Pare each excrescence, and each angle smooth,\r\n    Till now, in finish'd pride, two radiant rows\r\n    Of snow white cells one mutual base disclose.\r\n    Six shining panels gird each polish'd round,\r\n    The door's fine rim, with waxen fillet bound,\r\n    While walls so thin, with sister walls combined,\r\n    Weak in themselves, a sure dependence find.\"\r\n                                             _Evans._\r\n\r\nHuber was the first to demonstrate that wax is a natural secretion of\r\nthe bee, when fed on honey or any saccharine substance. Most Apiarians\r\nbefore his time, supposed that it was made from pollen or bee-bread,\r\neither in a crude or digested state. He confined a new swarm of bees in\r\na hive placed in a dark and cool room, and on examining them, at the\r\nend of five days, found several beautiful white combs in their\r\ntenement: these were taken from them, and they were again confined and\r\nsupplied with honey and water, and a second time new combs were\r\nconstructed. Five times in succession their combs were removed, and were\r\nin each instance replaced, the bees being all the time prevented from\r\nranging the fields, to supply themselves with bee-bread. By subsequent\r\nexperiments he proved that sugar answered the same end with honey.\r\n\r\nHe then confined a swarm, giving them no honey, but an abundance of\r\nfruit and pollen. They subsisted on the fruit, but refused to touch the\r\npollen; and no combs were constructed, nor any wax scales formed in\r\ntheir pouches. These experiments are conclusive; and are interesting,\r\nnot merely as proving that wax is secreted from honey or saccharine\r\nsubstances, but because they show in what a thorough manner the\r\nexperiments of Huber were conducted. Confident assertions are easily\r\nmade, requiring only a little breath or a drop of ink; and the men who\r\ndeal most in them, have often a profound contempt for observation and\r\nexperiment. To establish even a simple truth, on the solid foundation of\r\ndemonstrated facts, often requires the most patient and protracted toil.\r\n\r\n_A high temperature_ is necessary for comb-building, in order that the\r\nwax may be soft enough to be moulded into shape. The very process of its\r\nsecretion helps to furnish the amount of heat which is required to work\r\nit. This is a very interesting fact which seems never before to have\r\nbeen noticed.\r\n\r\nHoney or sugar is found to contain by weight, about eight pounds of\r\noxygen to one of carbon and hydrogen. When changed into wax, the\r\nproportions are entirely reversed: the wax contains only one pound of\r\noxygen to more than sixteen pounds of hydrogen and carbon. Now as\r\noxygen is the grand supporter of animal heat, the consumption of so\r\nlarge a quantity of it, aids in producing the extraordinary heat which\r\nalways accompanies comb-building, and which is necessary to keep the wax\r\nin the soft and plastic state requisite to enable the bees to mould it\r\ninto such exquisitely delicate and beautiful shapes! Who can fail to\r\nadmire the wisdom of the Creator in this beautiful instance of\r\nadaptation?\r\n\r\nThe most careful experiments have clearly established the fact, that at\r\nleast _twenty pounds_ of honey are consumed in making a single pound of\r\nwax. If any think that this is incredible, let them bear in mind that\r\nwax is an animal oil secreted from honey, and let them consider how many\r\npounds of corn or hay they must feed to their stock, in order to have\r\nthem gain a single pound of fat.\r\n\r\nMany Apiarians are entirely ignorant of the great value of empty comb.\r\nSuppose the honey to be worth only 15 cts. per lb., and the comb when\r\nrendered into wax, to be worth 30 cts. per lb., the bee-master who melts\r\na pound of comb, loses nearly three dollars by the operation, and this,\r\nwithout estimating the time which the bees have consumed in building the\r\ncomb. Unfortunately, in the ordinary hives, but little use can be made\r\nof empty comb, unless it is new, and can be put into the surplus\r\nhoney-boxes: but by the use of my movable frames, every piece of good\r\nworker-comb may be used to the best advantage, as it can be given to the\r\nbees, to aid them in their labors.\r\n\r\nIt has been found very difficult to preserve comb from the bee-moth,\r\nwhen it is taken from the bees. If it contains only a _few_ of the eggs\r\nof this destroyer, these, in due time, will produce a progeny sufficient\r\nto devour it. The comb, if it is attached to my frames, may be suspended\r\nin a box or empty hive, and thoroughly smoked with sulphur; this will\r\nkill any _worms_ which it may contain. When the weather is warm enough\r\nto hatch the eggs of the moth, this process must be repeated a few\r\ntimes, at intervals of about a week, so as to insure the destruction of\r\nthe worms as they hatch, for the sulphur does not seem always to destroy\r\nthe vitality of the eggs. The combs may now be kept in a tight box or\r\nhive, with perfect safety.\r\n\r\nCombs containing bee-bread, are of great value, and if given to young\r\ncolonies, which in spring are frequently destitute of this article, they\r\nwill materially assist them in early breeding.\r\n\r\nHoney may be taken from my hives in the frames, and the covers of the\r\ncells sliced off with a sharp knife; the honey can then be drained out,\r\nand the empty combs returned to be filled again. A strong stock of bees,\r\nin the height of the honey harvest, will fill empty combs with wonderful\r\nrapidity. I lay it down, as one of my _first principles_ in bee culture,\r\nthat no good comb should ever be melted; it should all be carefully\r\npreserved and given to the bees. If it is new, it may be easily attached\r\nto the frames, or the honey-receptacles, by dipping the edge into melted\r\nwax, pressing it gently until it stiffens, and then allowing it to cool.\r\nIf the comb is old, or the pieces large and full of bee-bread, it will\r\nbe best to dip them into melted rosin, which, besides costing much less\r\nthan wax, will secure a much firmer adhesion. When comb is put into\r\ntumblers or other small vessels, the bees will begin to work upon it the\r\nsooner, if it is simply crowded in, so as to be held in place by being\r\nsupported against the sides. It would seem as though they were disgusted\r\nwith such unworkmanlike proceedings, and that they cannot rest until\r\nthey have taken it into hand, and endeavored to \"make a job of it.\"\r\n\r\nIf the bee-keeper in using his choicest honey will be satisfied to\r\ndispense with looks, and will carefully drain it from the beautiful\r\ncomb, he may use all such comb again to great advantage; not only saving\r\nits intrinsic value, but greatly encouraging his bees to occupy and fill\r\nall receptacles in which a portion of it is put. Bees seem to fancy _a\r\ngood start in life_, about as well as their more intelligent owners. To\r\nthis use all suitable drone comb should be put, as soon as it is removed\r\nfrom the main hive. (See remarks on Drones.)\r\n\r\nIngenious efforts have been made, of late years, to construct\r\n_artificial_ honey combs of porcelain, to be used for _feeding_ bees. No\r\none, to my knowledge, has ever attempted to imitate the delicate\r\nmechanism of the bee so closely, as to construct artificial combs for\r\nthe ordinary uses of the hive; although for a long time I have\r\nentertained the idea as very desirable, and yet as barely possible. I am\r\nat present engaged in a course of experiments on this subject, the\r\nresults of which, in due time, I shall communicate to the public.\r\n\r\nWhile writing this treatise, it has occurred to me that bees might be\r\ninduced to use old wax for the construction of their combs. Very fine\r\nparings may be shaved off with glass, and if given to the bees, under\r\nfavorable circumstances, it seems to me very probable that they would\r\nuse them, just as they do the scales which are formed in their wax\r\npouches. Let strong colonies be deprived of some of their combs, after\r\nthe honey harvest is over, and supplied abundantly with these parings of\r\nwax. Whether \"nature abhors a vacuum,\" or not, bees certainly do, when\r\nit occurs among the combs of their main hive. They will not use the\r\nhoney stored up for winter use to replace the combs taken from them;\r\nthey can gather none from the flowers; and I have strong hopes that\r\nnecessity will with bees as well as men, prove the mother of invention,\r\nand lead them to use the wax, as readily as they do the substitutes\r\noffered them for pollen. (See Chapter on Pollen.)\r\n\r\nIf this conjecture should be verified by actual results, it would exert\r\na most powerful influence in the cheap and rapid multiplication of\r\ncolonies, and would enable the bees to store up most prodigious\r\nquantities of honey. A pound of bees wax might then be made to store up\r\ntwenty pounds of honey, and the gain to the bee keeper would be the\r\ndifference in price between the pound of wax, and the twenty pounds of\r\nhoney, which the bees would have consumed in making the same amount of\r\ncomb. Strong stocks might thus during the dull season, when no honey can\r\nbe procured, be most profitably employed in building spare comb, to be\r\nused in strengthening feeble stocks, and for a great variety of\r\npurposes. Give me the means of cheaply obtaining large amounts of comb,\r\nand I have almost found the philosopher's stone in bee keeping.\r\n\r\nThe building of comb is carried on with the greatest activity in the\r\nnight, while the honey is gathered by day. Thus no time is lost. If the\r\nweather is too forbidding to allow the bees to go abroad, the combs are\r\nvery rapidly constructed, as the labor is carried on both by day and by\r\nnight. On the return of a fair day, the bees gather unusual quantities\r\nof honey, as they have plenty of room for its storage. Thus it often\r\nhappens, that by their wise economy of time, they actually lose nothing,\r\neven if confined, for several days, to their hive.\r\n\r\n    \"How doth the little busy bee, improve each _shining_ hour!\"\r\n\r\nThe poet might with equal truth have described her, as improving the\r\ngloomy days, and the dark nights, in her useful labors.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact, which I do not remember ever to have seen\r\nparticularly noticed by any writer, that honey gathering, and comb\r\nbuilding, go on simultaneously; so that when one stops, the other ceases\r\nalso. I have repeatedly observed, that as soon as the honey harvest\r\nfails, the bees intermit their labors in building new comb, even when\r\nlarge portions of their hive are unfilled. They might enlarge their\r\ncombs by using some of their stores; but then they would incur the risk\r\nof perishing in the winter, by starvation. When honey no longer abounds\r\nin the fields, it is wisely ordered, that they should not consume their\r\nhoarded treasures, in expectation of further supplies, which may never\r\ncome. I do not believe, that any other safe rule could have been given\r\nthem; and if honey gathering was our business, with all our boasted\r\nreason, we should be obliged to adopt the very same course.\r\n\r\nWax is one of the best non-conductors of heat, so that when it is warmed\r\nby the animal heat of the bees, it can more easily be worked, than if it\r\nparted with its heat too readily. By this property, the combs serve also\r\nto keep the bees warm, and there is not so much risk of the honey\r\ncandying in the cells, or the combs cracking with frost. If wax was a\r\ngood conductor of heat, the combs would often be icy cold, moisture\r\nwould condense and freeze upon them, and they would fail to answer the\r\nends for which they are intended.\r\n\r\nThe size of the cells, in which workers are reared, never varies: the\r\nsame may substantially be said of the drone cells which are very\r\nconsiderably larger; the cells in which honey is stored, often vary\r\nexceedingly in depth, while in diameter, they are of all sizes from that\r\nof the worker cells to that of the drones.\r\n\r\nThe cells of the bees are found perfectly to answer all the most refined\r\nconditions of a very intricate mathematical problem! Let it be required\r\nto find what shape a given quantity of matter must take, in order to\r\nhave _the greatest capacity, and the greatest strength_, requiring at\r\nthe same time, _the least space, and the least labor_ in its\r\nconstruction. This problem has been solved by the most refined processes\r\nof the higher mathematics, and the result is the hexagonal or six-sided\r\ncell of the honey bee, with its three four-sided figures at the base!\r\n\r\nThe shape of these figures cannot be altered, _ever so little, except\r\nfor the worse_. Besides possessing the desirable qualities already\r\ndescribed, they answer as _nurseries_ for the rearing of the young, and\r\nas _small air-tight vessels_ in which the honey is preserved from\r\nsouring or candying. Every prudent housewife who puts up her preserves\r\nin tumblers, or small glass jars, and carefully pastes them over, to\r\nkeep out the air, will understand the value of such an arrangement.\r\n\r\n\"There are only three possible figures of the cells,\" says Dr. Reid,\r\n\"which can make them all equal and similar, without any useless spaces\r\nbetween them. These are the equilateral triangle, the square and the\r\nregular hexagon. It is well known to mathematicians that there is not a\r\nfourth way possible, in which a plane may be cut into little spaces that\r\nshall be equal, similar and regular, without leaving any interstices.\"\r\n\r\nAn equilateral triangle would have made an uncomfortable tenement for an\r\ninsect with a round body; and a square would not have been much better.\r\nAt first sight a circle would seem to be the best shape for the\r\ndevelopment of the larvæ: but such a figure would have caused a needless\r\nsacrifice of space, materials and strength; while the honey which now\r\nadheres so admirably to the many angles or corners of the six-sided\r\ncell, would have been much more liable to run out! I will venture to\r\nassign a new reason for the hexagonal form. The body of the immature\r\ninsect as it undergoes its changes, is charged with a super-abundance of\r\nmoisture which passes off through the reticulated cover which the bees\r\nbuild over its cell: a hexagon while it approaches so nearly the shape\r\nof a circle as not to incommode the young bee, furnishes in its six\r\ncorners the necessary vacancies for its more thorough ventilation!\r\n\r\nSo invariably uniform in size, as well as perfect in other respects, are\r\nthe cells in which the workers are bred, that some mathematicians have\r\nproposed their adoption, as the best unit for measures of capacity to\r\nserve for universal use.\r\n\r\nCan we believe that these little insects unite so many requisites in the\r\nconstruction of their cells, either by chance, or because they are\r\nprofoundly versed in the most intricate mathematics? Are we not\r\ncompelled to acknowledge that the mathematics must be referred to the\r\nCreator, and not to His puny creature? To an intelligent, candid mind, a\r\npiece of honey comb is a complete demonstration that there is a \"GREAT\r\nFIRST CAUSE:\" for on no other supposition can we account for so\r\ncomplicated a shape, and yet the only one which can possibly unite so\r\nmany desirable requisites.\r\n\r\n    \"On books deep poring, ye pale sons of toil,\r\n    Who waste in studious trance the midnight oil,\r\n    Say, can ye emulate with all your rules,\r\n    Drawn or from Grecian or from Gothic schools,\r\n    This artless frame? Instinct her simple guide,\r\n    A heaven-taught Insect baffles all your pride.\r\n    Not all yon marshall'd orbs, that ride so high,\r\n    Proclaim more loud a present Deity,\r\n    Than the nice symmetry of these small cells,\r\n    Where on each angle genuine science dwells.\"\r\n                                          _Evans._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPROPOLIS, OR \"BEE-GLUE.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis substance is obtained by the bees from the resinous buds and limbs\r\nof trees; and when first gathered, it is usually of a bright golden\r\ncolor, and is exceedingly sticky. The different kinds of poplars furnish\r\na rich supply. The bees bring it on their thighs just as they do bee\r\nbread; and I have caught them as they were entering with a load, and\r\ntaken it from them. It adheres so firmly that it is difficult to remove\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Huber planted in Spring some branches of the wild poplar, before the\r\nleaves were developed, and placed them in pots near his Apiary; the bees\r\nalighting on them, separated the folds of the largest buds with their\r\nforceps, extracted the varnish in threads, and loaded with it, first one\r\nthigh and then the other; for they convey it like pollen, transferring\r\nit by the first pair of legs to the second, by which it is lodged in the\r\nhollow of the third.\" The smell of the propolis is often precisely\r\nsimilar to that of the resin from the poplar, and chemical analysis\r\nproves the identity of the two substances. It is frequently gathered\r\nfrom the alder, horse-chestnut, birch, and willow; and as some think,\r\nfrom pines and other trees of the fir kind. I have often known bees to\r\nenter the shops where varnishing was being carried on, attracted\r\nevidently by the smell: and Bevan mentions the fact of their carrying\r\noff a composition of wax and turpentine, from trees to which it had\r\nbeen applied. Dr. Evans says that he has seen them collect the balsamic\r\nvarnish which coats the young blossom buds of the hollyhock, and has\r\nknown them to rest at least ten minutes on the same bud, moulding the\r\nbalsam with their fore feet, and transferring it to the hinder legs, as\r\ndescribed by Huber.\r\n\r\n    \"With merry hum the Willow's copse they scale,\r\n    The Fir's dark pyramid, or Poplar pale,\r\n    Scoop from the Aider's leaf its oozy flood,\r\n    Or strip the Chestnut's resin-coated bud,\r\n    Skim the light tear that tips Narcissus' ray,\r\n    Or round the Hollyhock's hoar fragrance play.\r\n    Soon temper'd to their will through eve's low beam,\r\n    And link'd in airy bands the viscous stream,\r\n    They waft their nut-brown loads exulting home,\r\n    That form a fret-work for the future comb;\r\n    Caulk every chink where rushing winds may roar,\r\n    And seal their circling ramparts to the floor.\"\r\n                                            _Evans._\r\n\r\nA mixture of wax and propolis is used by the bees to strengthen the\r\nattachments of the combs to the top and sides of the hive, and serves\r\nmost admirably for this purpose, as it is much more adhesive than wax\r\nalone. If the combs, as soon as they are built, are not filled with\r\nhoney or brood, they are beautifully varnished with a most delicate\r\ncoating of this material, which adds exceedingly to their strength: but\r\nas this natural varnish impairs their delicate whiteness, they ought not\r\nto be allowed to remain in the surplus honey receptacles, accessible to\r\nthe bees, unless when they are actively engaged in storing them with\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\nThe bees make a very liberal use of this substance to fill up all the\r\ncrevices about their premises: and as the natural summer heat of the\r\nhive keeps it soft, the bee moth selects it as a proper place of deposit\r\nfor her eggs. For this reason, the hive should be made of sound lumber,\r\nentirely free from cracks, and thoroughly painted on the inside as well\r\nas outside. When glass is used, there is no risk that the bed moth will\r\nfind a place in which she can insert her ovi-positor and lay her eggs.\r\nThe corners of the hive, which the bees always fill with propolis,\r\nshould have a melted mixture of three parts rosin, and one part bees-wax\r\nrun into them, which remains hard during the hottest weather, and bids\r\ndefiance to the moth. The inside of the hive may be coated with the same\r\nmixture, put on hot with a brush.\r\n\r\nThe bees find it difficult to gather the propolis, and equally so to\r\nremove from their thighs, and to work so sticky a material. For this\r\nreason, it is doubly important to save them all unnecessary labor in\r\namassing it. To men, time is _money_; to bees, it is _honey_; and all\r\nthe arrangements of the hive should be such as to economize it to the\r\nvery utmost.\r\n\r\nPropolis is sometimes put to a very curious use by the bees. \"A\r\nsnail[10] having crept into one of M. Reaumur's hives early in the\r\nmorning, after crawling about for some time, adhered by means of its own\r\nslime to one of the glass panes. The bees having discovered the snail,\r\nsurrounded it and formed a border of propolis round the verge of its\r\nshell, and fastened it so securely to the glass that it became\r\nimmovable.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Forever closed the impenetrable door,\r\n    It naught avails that in his torpid veins\r\n    Year after year, life's loitering spark remains.\"[11]\r\n                                             _Evans._\r\n\r\n\"Maraldi, another eminent Apiarian, has related a somewhat similar\r\ninstance. He states that a snail without a shell, or slug, as it is\r\ncalled, had entered one of his hives; and that the bees, as soon as they\r\nobserved it, stung it to death: after which being unable to dislodge\r\nit, they covered it all over with an impervious coat of propolis.\"\r\n\r\n    \"For soon in fearless ire, their wonder lost,\r\n    Spring fiercely from the comb the indignant host,\r\n    Lay the pierced monster breathless on the ground,\r\n    And clap in joy their victor pinions round:\r\n    While all in vain concurrent numbers strive,\r\n    To heave the slime-girt giant from the hive--\r\n    Sure not alone by force Instinctive swayed,\r\n    But blest with reason's soul directing aid,\r\n    Alike in man or bee, they haste to pour,\r\n    Thick hard'ning as it falls, the flaky shower;\r\n    Embalmed in shroud of glue the mummy lies,\r\n    No worms invade, no foul miasmas rise.\"\r\n                                             _Evans._\r\n\r\n\"In these cases who can withhold his admiration of the ingenuity and\r\njudgment of the bees? _In the first case_ a troublesome creature gained\r\nadmission to the hive, which, from its unwieldiness, they could not\r\nremove, and which, from the impenetrability of its shell, they could not\r\ndestroy: here then their only resource was to deprive it of locomotion,\r\nand to obviate putrefaction; both which objects they accomplished most\r\nskilfully and securely--and as is usual with these sagacious creatures,\r\nat the least possible expense of labor and materials. They applied their\r\ncement where alone it was required, round the verge of the shell. _In\r\nthe latter case_, to obviate the evil of decay, by the total exclusion\r\nof air, they were obliged to be more lavish in the use of their\r\nembalming material, and to case over the \"slime girt giant\" so as to\r\nguard themselves from his noisome smell. What means more effectual could\r\nhuman wisdom have devised under similar circumstances?\"\r\n\r\n    \"If in the insect, Season's twilight ray\r\n    Sheds on the darkling mind a doubtful day,\r\n    Plain is the steady light her _Instincts_ yield,\r\n    To point the road o'er life's unvaried field;\r\n    If few these instincts, to the destined goal,\r\n    With surer coarse, their straiten'd currents roll.\"\r\n                                             _Evans._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] Bevan.\r\n\r\n[11] Some very extraordinary instances are related of the protraction of\r\nlife in snails. After they had lain in a cabinet above fifteen years,\r\nimmersing them in water caused them to revive and crawl out of their\r\nshells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nPOLLEN, OR BEE-BREAD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis substance is gathered by the bees from the flowers, or blossoms,\r\nand is used _for the nourishment of their young_. Repeated experiments\r\nhave proved that no brood can be raised in a hive, unless the bees are\r\nsupplied with it. It contains none of the elements of wax, but is rich\r\nin what chemists call nitrogenous substances, which are not contained in\r\nhoney, and which furnish ample nourishment for the development of the\r\ngrowing bee. Dr. Hunter dissected some immature bees, and found their\r\nstomachs to contain farina, but not a particle of honey.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Huber for the discovery of the use made by the bees\r\nof pollen. That it did not serve as food for the mature bees, was\r\nevident from the fact that large supplies are often found in hives whose\r\ninmates have starved to death. It was this fact which led the old\r\nobservers to conclude that it was gathered for the purpose of building\r\ncomb. After Huber had demonstrated that wax is secreted from an entirely\r\ndifferent substance, he was soon led to conjecture that the bee-bread\r\nmust be used for the nourishment of the embryo bees. By rigid\r\nexperiments he proved the truth of this supposition. Bees were confined\r\nto their hive without any pollen, after being supplied with honey, eggs\r\nand larvæ. In a short time the young all perished. A fresh supply of\r\nbrood was given to them, with an ample allowance of pollen, and the\r\ndevelopment of the larvæ then proceeded in the natural way.\r\n\r\nWhen a colony is actively engaged in carrying in this article, it may be\r\ntaken for granted that they have a fertile queen, and are busy in\r\nbreeding. On the contrary, if any colony is not gathering pollen when\r\nothers are, the queen is either dead, or diseased, and the hive should\r\nat once be examined.\r\n\r\nIn the backward spring of 1852, I had an excellent opportunity of\r\ntesting the value of this substance. In one of my hives, was an\r\nartificial swarm of the previous year. The hive was well protected,\r\nbeing double, and the situation was warm. I opened it on the 5th of\r\nFebruary, and although the weather, until within a week of that time,\r\nhad been unusually cold, I found many of the cells filled with brood. On\r\nthe 23d, the combs were again examined, and found to contain, neither\r\neggs, brood, nor bee bread. The bees were then supplied with bee bread\r\ntaken from another hive: the next day, this was found to have been used\r\nby them, and a large number of eggs had been deposited in the cells.\r\nWhen this supply was exhausted, egg-laying ceased, and was again renewed\r\nwhen more was furnished them.\r\n\r\nDuring all the time of these experiments, the weather was unpromising,\r\nand as the bees were unable to go out for water, they were supplied at\r\nhome with this important article.\r\n\r\nDzierzon is of opinion that the bees are able to furnish food for the\r\nyoung, without the presence of pollen in the hive; although he admits\r\nthat they can do this only for a short time, and at a great expense of\r\nvital energy; just as the strength of an animal nursing its young is\r\nrapidly reduced, when for want of proper food, the very substance of\r\nits own body as it were, is converted into milk. My experiments do not\r\ncorroborate this theory, but tend to confirm the views of Huber, and to\r\nshow the absolute necessity of pollen to the development of brood. The\r\nsame able contributor to Apiarian science, thinks that pollen is used by\r\nthe bees when they are engaged in comb-building; and that unless they\r\nare well supplied with it, they cannot rapidly secrete wax, without very\r\nseverely taxing their strength. But as all the elements of wax are found\r\nin honey, and none of them in pollen, this opinion does not seem to me,\r\nto be entitled to much weight. That bees cannot live upon pollen without\r\nany honey, is proved by the fact, that large stores of it are often\r\nfound, in hives whose occupants have died of starvation; that they can\r\nlive without it, is equally well known; but that the full grown bees\r\nmake some use of it in connection with honey, for their own nourishment,\r\nI believe to be highly probable.\r\n\r\nThe bees prefer to gather _fresh_ bee-bread, even when there are large\r\naccumulations of old stores in the cells. Hence, the great importance of\r\nbeing able to make the _surplus_ of old colonies supply the _deficiency_\r\nof young ones. (See No. 28, in the Chapter \"On the advantages which\r\nought to be found in an Improved Hive.\")\r\n\r\nIf both honey and pollen can be obtained from the same flower, then a\r\nload of _each_ will be secured by the industrious insect. Of this, any\r\none may convince himself, who will dissect a few pollen gatherers at the\r\ntime when honey is plenty: he will generally find their honey-bags full.\r\n\r\nThe mode of gathering is very interesting. The body of the bee appears,\r\nto the naked eye, to be covered with fine hairs; to these, when the bee\r\nalights on a flower, the farina adheres. With her legs, she brushes it\r\noff from her body, and packs it in two hollows or _baskets_, one on each\r\nof her thighs: these baskets are surrounded by stouter hairs which hold\r\nthe load in its place.\r\n\r\nWhen the bee returns with pollen, she often makes a singular, dancing or\r\nvibratory motion, which attracts the attention of the other bees, who at\r\nonce nibble away from her thighs what they want for immediate use; the\r\nrest she deposits in a cell for future need, where it is carefully\r\npacked down, and often sealed over with wax.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that a bee, in gathering pollen, always confines\r\nherself to the same kind of flower on which she begins, even when that\r\nis not so abundant as some others. Thus if you examine a ball of this\r\nsubstance taken from her thigh, it is found to be of one uniform color\r\nthroughout: the load of one will be yellow, another red, and a third\r\nbrown; the color varying according to that of the plant from which it\r\nwas obtained. It is probable that the pollen of different kinds of\r\nflowers would not pack so well together. It is certain that if they flew\r\nfrom one species to another, there would be a much greater mixture of\r\ndifferent varieties than there now is, for they carry on their bodies\r\nthe pollen or fertilizing principle, and thus aid most powerfully in the\r\nimpregnation of plants.\r\n\r\nThis is one reason why it is so difficult to preserve pure, the\r\ndifferent varieties of the same vegetables whose flowers are sought by\r\nthe bee.\r\n\r\nHe must be blind indeed, who will not see, at every step in the natural\r\nhistory of this insect, the plainest proofs of the wisdom of its\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\nI cannot resist the impression that the honey bee was made for the\r\nespecial service and instruction of man. At first the importance of its\r\nproducts, when honey was the only natural sweet, served most powerfully\r\nto attract his attention to its curious habits; and now since the\r\ncultivation of the sugar cane has diminished the relative value of its\r\nluscious sweets, the superior knowledge which has been obtained of its\r\ninstincts, is awakening an increasing enthusiasm in its cultivation.\r\n\r\nVirgil in the fourth book of his Georgics, which is entirely devoted to\r\nbees, speaks of them as having received a direct emanation from the\r\nDivine Intelligence. And many modern Apiarians are almost disposed to\r\nrank the bee for sagacity, as next in the scale of creation to man.\r\n\r\nThe importance of pollen to the nourishment of the brood, has long been\r\nknown, and of late, successful attempts have been made to furnish a\r\n_substitute_. The bees in Dzierzon's Apiary were observed by him, early\r\nin the spring before the time for procuring pollen, to bring rye meal to\r\ntheir hives from a neighboring mill. It is now a common practice on the\r\ncontinent of Europe, where bee keeping is extensively carried on, to\r\nsupply the bees, in early spring, with this article. Shallow troughs are\r\nset in front of the Apiaries, which are filled, about two inches deep,\r\nwith _finely ground, dry, unbolted rye meal_. Thousands of bees resort\r\neagerly to them when the weather is favorable, roll themselves in the\r\nmeal, and return heavily laden to their hives. In fine, mild weather,\r\nthey labor at this work with astonishing industry; and seem decidedly to\r\nprefer the meal to the _old_ pollen stored in their combs. By this\r\nmeans, the bees are induced to commence breeding _early_, and rapidly\r\nrecruit their numbers. The feeding is continued till the bees cease to\r\ncarry away the meal; that is, until the natural supplies furnish them\r\nwith a preferable article. The average consumption of each colony is\r\nabout two pounds of meal!\r\n\r\nAt the last annual Apiarian Convention in Germany, a cultivator\r\nrecommended wheat flour as an excellent substitute for pollen. He says\r\nthat in February, 1852, he used it with the best results. The bees\r\n_forsook the honey_ which had been set out for them, and engaged\r\nactively in carrying in large quantities of the wheat flour, which was\r\nplaced about twenty paces in front of the hives.\r\n\r\nThe construction of my hives, permits the flour to be placed, at once,\r\nwhere the bees can take it, without being compelled to waste their time\r\nin going out for it, or to suffer for the want of it, when the weather\r\nconfines them at home.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this substitute, removes a serious obstacle to the\r\nsuccessful culture of bees. In many districts, there is a great\r\nabundance of honey for a few weeks in the season; and almost any number\r\nof colonies, which are strong when the honey harvest commences, will, in\r\na good season, lay up sufficient stores for themselves, and a large\r\nsurplus for their owners. In many of these districts, however, the\r\nsupply of pollen is often so insufficient, that the new colonies of the\r\nprevious year are found destitute of this article in the spring; and\r\nunless the season is early, and the weather unusually favorable, the\r\nproduction of brood is most seriously interfered with; thus the colony\r\nbecomes strong too late to avail itself to the best advantage of the\r\nsuperabundant harvest of honey. (See remarks on the importance of having\r\nstrong stocks early in the Spring.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nON THE ADVANTAGES WHICH OUGHT TO BE FOUND IN AN IMPROVED HIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, I shall enumerate certain very desirable, if not\r\nnecessary, qualities of a good hive. I have neither the taste nor the\r\ntime for the invidious work of disparaging other hives. I prefer\r\ninviting the attention of bee-keepers to the importance of these\r\nrequisites; some of which, as I believe, are contained in no hive but my\r\nown. Let them be most carefully examined, and if they commend themselves\r\nto the enlightened judgment and good common sense of cultivators, let\r\nthem be employed to test the comparative merits of the various kinds of\r\nhives in common use.\r\n\r\n1. A good hive should give the Apiarian a perfect control over all the\r\ncombs: so that any of them may be taken out at pleasure; and this,\r\nwithout cutting them, or enraging the bees.\r\n\r\nThis advantage is possessed by no hive in use, except my own; and it\r\nforms the very foundation of an improved and profitable system of\r\nbee-culture. Unless the combs are at the entire command of the Apiarian,\r\nhe can have no effectual control over his bees. They swarm too much or\r\ntoo little, just as suits themselves, and their owner is almost entirely\r\ndependent upon their caprice.\r\n\r\n2. It ought to afford suitable protection against extremes of heat and\r\ncold, sudden changes of temperature, and the injurious effects of\r\ndampness.\r\n\r\nIn winter, the interior of the hive should be dry, and not a particle of\r\nfrost should ever find admission; and in summer, the bees should not be\r\nforced to work to disadvantage in a pent and almost suffocating heat.\r\n(See these points discussed in the Chapter on Protection.)\r\n\r\n3. It should permit all necessary operations to be performed without\r\nhurting or killing a single bee.\r\n\r\nMost hives are so constructed that it is impossible to manage them,\r\nwithout at times injuring or destroying some of the bees. The mere\r\ndestruction of a few bees, would not, except on the score of humanity,\r\nbe of much consequence, if it did not very materially increase the\r\ndifficulty of managing them. Bees remember injuries done to any of their\r\nnumber, for some time, and generally find an opportunity to avenge them.\r\n\r\n4. It should allow every thing to be done that is necessary in the most\r\nextensive management of bees, without incurring any serious risk of\r\nexciting their anger. (See Chapter on the Anger of Bees.)\r\n\r\n5. Not a single unnecessary step or motion ought to be required of a\r\nsingle bee.\r\n\r\nThe honey harvest, in most locations, is of short continuance; and all\r\nthe arrangements of the hive should facilitate, to the utmost, the work\r\nof the busy gatherers. Tall hives, therefore, and all such as compel\r\nthem to travel with their heavy burdens through densely crowded combs,\r\nare very objectionable. The bees in my hive, instead of forcing their\r\nway through thick clusters, can easily pass into the surplus honey\r\nboxes, not only from any comb in the hive, but without traveling over\r\nthe combs at all.\r\n\r\n6. It should afford suitable facilities for inspecting, at all times,\r\nthe condition of the bees.\r\n\r\nWhen the sides of my hive are of glass, as soon as the outer cover is\r\nelevated, the Apiarian has a view of the interior, and can often at a\r\nglance, determine its condition. If the hive is of wood, or if he wishes\r\nto make a more thorough examination, in a few minutes every comb may be\r\ntaken out, and separately inspected. In this way, the exact condition of\r\nevery colony may always be easily ascertained, and nothing left, as in\r\nthe common hives, to mere conjecture. This is an advantage, the\r\nimportance of which it would be difficult to over estimate. (See\r\nChapters on the loss of the queen, and on the Bee Moth.)\r\n\r\n7. While the hive is of a size adapted to the natural instincts of the\r\nbee, it should be capable of being readily adjusted to the wants of\r\nsmall colonies.\r\n\r\nIf a small swarm is put into a large hive, they will be unable to\r\nconcentrate their animal heat, so as to work to the best advantage, and\r\nwill often become discouraged, and abandon their hive. If they are put\r\ninto a small hive, its limited dimensions will not afford them suitable\r\naccommodations for increase. By means of my movable partition, my hive\r\ncan, in a few moments, be adapted to the wants of any colony however\r\nsmall, and can, with equal facility, be enlarged from time to time, or\r\nat once restored to its full dimensions.\r\n\r\n8. It should allow the combs to be removed without any jarring.\r\n\r\nBees manifest the utmost aversion to any sudden jar; for it is in this\r\nway, that their combs are loosened and detached. However firmly fastened\r\nthe frames may be in my hive, they can all be loosened in a few moments,\r\nwithout injuring or exciting the bees.\r\n\r\n9. It should allow every good piece of comb to be given to the bees,\r\ninstead of being melted into wax. (See Chapter on Comb.)\r\n\r\n10. The construction of the hive should induce the bees to build their\r\ncombs with great regularity.\r\n\r\nA hive which contains a large proportion of irregular comb, can never be\r\nexpected to prosper. Such comb is only suitable for storing honey, or\r\nraising drones. This is one reason why so many colonies never flourish.\r\nA glance will often show that a hive contains so much drone comb, as to\r\nbe unfit for the purposes of a stock hive.\r\n\r\n11. It should furnish the means of procuring comb to be used as a guide\r\nto the bees, in building regular combs in empty hives; and to induce\r\nthem more readily to take possession of the surplus honey receptacles.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the presence of comb will induce bees to begin\r\nwork much more readily than they otherwise Would: this is especially the\r\ncase in glass vessels.\r\n\r\n12. It should allow the removal of drone combs from the hive, to prevent\r\nthe breeding of too many drones. (See remarks on Drones.)\r\n\r\n13. It should enable the Apiarian, when the combs become too old, to\r\nremove them, and supply their place with new ones.\r\n\r\nNo hive can, in this respect, equal one in which, in a few moments, any\r\ncomb can be removed, and the part which is too old, be cut off. The\r\nupper part of a comb, which is generally used for storing honey, will\r\nlast without renewal for many years.\r\n\r\n14. It ought to furnish the greatest possible security against the\r\nravages of the Bee-Moth.\r\n\r\nNeither before nor after it is occupied, ought there to be any cracks\r\nor crevices in the interior. All such places will be filled by the bees\r\nwith propolis or bee-glue; a substance, which is always soft in the\r\nsummer heat of the hive, and which forms a most congenial place of\r\ndeposit for the eggs of the moth. If the sides of the hive are of glass,\r\nand the corners are run with a melted mixture, three parts rosin, and\r\none part bees-wax, the bees will waste but little time in gathering\r\npropolis, and the bee-moth will find but little chance for laying her\r\neggs, even if she should succeed in entering the hive.\r\n\r\nMy hives are so constructed, that if made of wood, they may be\r\nthoroughly painted inside and outside, without being so smooth as to\r\nannoy the bees; for they travel over the frames to which the combs are\r\nattached; and thus whether the inside surface is glass or wood, it is\r\nnot liable to crack, or warp, or absorb moisture, after the hive is\r\noccupied by the bees. If the hives are painted inside, it should be done\r\nsometime before they are used. If the interior of the wooden hive is\r\nbrushed with a very hot mixture of the rosin and bees-wax, the hives may\r\nbe used immediately.\r\n\r\n15. It should furnish some place accessible to the Apiarian, where the\r\nbee-moth can be tempted to deposit her eggs, and the worms, when full\r\ngrown, to wind themselves in their cocoons. (See remarks on the\r\nBee-Moth.)\r\n\r\n16. It should enable the Apiarian, if the bee-moth ever gains the upper\r\nhand of the bees, to remove the combs, and expel the worms. (See\r\nBee-Moth.)\r\n\r\n17. The bottom board should be permanently attached to the hive; for if\r\nthis is not done, it will be inconvenient to move the hive when bees are\r\nin it, and next to impossible to prevent the depredations of moths and\r\nworms.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, there will be crevices between the bottom board and the\r\nsides of the hive, through which the moths will gain admission, and\r\nunder which the worms, when fully grown, will retreat to spin their\r\nwebs, and to be changed into moths, to enter in their turn, and lay\r\ntheir eggs. Movable bottom hoards are a great nuisance in the Apiary,\r\nand the construction of my hive, which enables me entirely to dispense\r\nwith them, will furnish a very great protection against the bee-moth.\r\nThere is no place where they can get in, except at the entrance for the\r\nbees, and this may be contracted or enlarged, to suit the strength of\r\nthe colony; and from its peculiar shape, the bees are enabled to defend\r\nit against intruders, with the greatest advantage.\r\n\r\n18. The bottom-board should slant towards the entrance, to assist the\r\nbees in carrying out the dead, and other useless substances; to aid them\r\nin defending themselves against robbers; to carry off all moisture; and\r\nto prevent the rain and snow from beating into the hive. As a farther\r\nprecaution against this last evil, the entrance ought to be under a\r\ncovered way, which should not, at once lead into the interior.\r\n\r\n19. The bottom-board should be so constructed that it may be readily\r\ncleared of dead bees in cold weather, when the bees are unable to attend\r\nto this business themselves.\r\n\r\nIf suffered to remain, they often become mouldy, and injure the health\r\nof the colony. If the bees drag them out, as they will do, if the\r\nweather moderates, they often fall with them on the snow, and are so\r\nchilled that they never rise again; for a bee generally retains its hold\r\nin flying away with the dead, until both fall to the ground.\r\n\r\n20. No part of the interior of the hive should be below the level of the\r\nplace of exit.\r\n\r\nIf this principle is violated, the bees must, at great disadvantage,\r\ndrag their dead, and all the refuse of the hive, _up hill_. Such hives\r\nwill often have their bottom boards covered with small pieces of comb,\r\nbee-bread, and other impurities, in which the moth delights to lay her\r\neggs; and which furnished her progeny with a most congenial nourishment,\r\nuntil they are able to get access to the combs.\r\n\r\n21. It should afford facilities for feeding the bees both in warm and\r\ncold weather.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, my hive has very unusual advantages. Sixty colonies in\r\nwarm weather may, in an hour, be fed a quart each, and yet no feeder be\r\nused, and no risk incurred from robbing bees. (See Chapter on Feeding.)\r\n\r\n22. It should allow of the easy hiving of a swarm, without injuring any\r\nof the bees, or risking the destruction of the queen. (See Chapter on\r\nNatural Swarming, and Hiving.)\r\n\r\n23. It should admit of the safe transportation of the bees to any\r\ndistance whatever.\r\n\r\nThe permanent bottom-board, the firm attachment of the combs, each to a\r\nseparate frame, and the facility with which, in my hive, any amount of\r\nair can be given to the bees when shut up, most admirably adapt it to\r\nthis purpose.\r\n\r\n24. It should furnish the bees with air when the entrance is shut; and\r\nthe ventilation for this purpose ought to be unobstructed, even if the\r\nhives should be buried in two or three feet of snow. (See Chapter on\r\nProtection.)\r\n\r\n25. A good hive should furnish facilities for enlarging, contracting,\r\nand closing the entrance; so as to protect the bees against robbers, and\r\nthe bee-moth; and when the entrance is altered, the bees ought not to\r\nlose valuable time in searching for it, as they must do in most hives.\r\n(See Chapters on Ventilation, and on Robbing.)\r\n\r\n26. It should give the bees the means of ventilating their hives,\r\nwithout enlarging the entrance too much, so as to expose them to moths\r\nand robbers, and to the risk of losing their brood by a chill in sudden\r\nchanges of weather. (See Chapter on Ventilation.)\r\n\r\nTo secure this end, the ventilators must not only be independent of the\r\nentrance, but they must owe their efficiency mainly to the co-operation\r\nof the bees themselves, who thus have a free admission of air only when\r\nthey want it. To depend on the opening and shutting of the ventilators\r\nby the bee-keeper, is entirely out of the question.\r\n\r\n27. It should furnish facilities for admitting at once, a large body of\r\nair; so that in winter, or early spring, when the weather is at any time\r\nunusually mild, the bees may be tempted to fly out and discharge their\r\nfæces. (See Chapter on Protection.)\r\n\r\nIf such a free admission of air cannot be given to hives which are\r\nthoroughly protected against the cold, the bees may lose a favorable\r\nopportunity of emptying themselves; and thus be more exposed than they\r\notherwise would, to suffer from diseases resulting from too long\r\nconfinement. A very free admission of air is also desirable when the\r\nweather is exceedingly hot.\r\n\r\n28. It should enable the Apiarian to remove the excess of bee-bread from\r\nold stocks.\r\n\r\nThis article always accumulates in old hives, so that in the course of\r\ntime, many of the combs are filled with it, thus unfitting them for the\r\nrearing of brood, and the reception of honey. Young stocks, on the other\r\nhand, will often be so deficient in this important article, that in the\r\nearly part of the season, breeding will be seriously interfered with. By\r\nmeans of my movable frames, the excess of old colonies may be made to\r\nsupply the deficiency of young ones, to the mutual benefit of both. (See\r\nChapter on Pollen.)\r\n\r\n29. It should enable the Apiarian, when he has removed the combs from a\r\ncommon hive, to place them with the bees, brood, honey and bee-bread, in\r\nthe improved hive, so that the bees may be able to attach them in their\r\nnatural positions. (See directions for transferring bees from an old\r\nhive.)\r\n\r\n30. It should allow of the easy and safe dislodgement of the bees from\r\nthe hive.\r\n\r\nThis requisite is especially important to secure the union of colonies,\r\nwhen it becomes necessary to break up some of the stocks. (See remarks\r\non the Union of Stocks.)\r\n\r\n31. It should allow the heat and odor of the main hive, as well as the\r\nbees themselves, to pass in the freest manner, to the surplus honey\r\nreceptacles.\r\n\r\nIn this respect, all the hives with which I am acquainted, are more or\r\nless deficient: the bees are forced to work in receptacles difficult of\r\naccess, and in which, especially in cool nights, they find it impossible\r\nto keep up the animal heat necessary for comb-building. Bees cannot, in\r\nsuch hives, work to advantage in glass tumblers, or other small vessels.\r\nOne of the most important arrangements of my hive, is that by which the\r\nheat ascends into all the receptacles for storing honey, as naturally\r\nand almost as easily as the warmest air ascends to the top of a heated\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n32. It should permit the surplus honey to be taken away, in the most\r\nconvenient, beautiful and salable forms, at any time, and without any\r\nrisk of annoyance from the bees.\r\n\r\nIn my hives, it may be taken in tumblers, glass boxes, wooden boxes\r\nsmall or large, earthen jars, flower-pots; in short, in any kind of\r\nreceptacle which may suit the fancy, or the convenience of the\r\nbee-keeper. Or all these may be dispensed with, and the honey may be\r\ntaken from the interior of the main hive, by removing the frames with\r\nloaded combs, and supplying their place with empty ones.\r\n\r\n33. It should admit of the easy removal of all the good honey from the\r\nmain hive, that its place may be supplied with an inferior article.\r\n\r\nBee-Keepers who have but few colonies, and who wish to secure the\r\nlargest yield, may remove the loaded combs from my hive, slice off the\r\ncovers of the cells, drain out the honey, and restore the empty combs,\r\ninto which, if the season of gathering is over, they can first pour the\r\ncheap foreign honey for the use of the bees.\r\n\r\n34. It should allow, when quantity not quality is the object, the\r\nlargest amount of honey to be gathered; so that the surplus of strong\r\ncolonies may, in the Fall, be given to those which have not a sufficient\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nBy surmounting my hive with a box of the same dimensions, the combs may\r\nall be transferred to this box, and the bees, when they commence\r\nbuilding, will descend and fill the lower frames, gradually using the\r\nupper box, as the brood is hatched out, for storing honey. In this way,\r\nthe largest possible yield of honey may be secured, as the bees always\r\nprefer to continue their work below, rather than above the main hive,\r\nand will never swarm, when allowed in season, ample room in this\r\ndirection. The combs in the upper box, containing a large amount of\r\nbee-bread and being of a size adapted to the breeding of workers, will\r\nbe all the better for aiding weak colonies.\r\n\r\n35. It should compel, when desired, the force of the colony to be mainly\r\ndirected to raising young bees; so that brood may be on hand to form new\r\ncolonies, and strengthen feeble stocks. (See Chapter on Artificial\r\nSwarming.)\r\n\r\n36. It ought, while well protected from the weather, to be so\r\nconstructed, that in warm, sunny days in early spring, the influence of\r\nthe sun may be allowed to penetrate and warm up the hive, so as to\r\nencourage early breeding. (See Chapter on Protection.)\r\n\r\n37. The hive should be equally well adapted to be used as a swarmer, or\r\nnon-swarmer.\r\n\r\nIn my hives bees may be allowed, if their owner chooses, to swarm just\r\nas they do in common hives, and be managed in the usual way. Even on\r\nthis plan, the great protection against the weather which it affords,\r\nand the command over all the combs, will be found to afford great\r\nadvantages. (See Natural Swarming.)\r\n\r\nNon-swarming hives managed in the ordinary way are liable, in spite of\r\nall precautions, to swarm very unexpectedly, and if not closely watched,\r\nthe swarm is lost, and with it the profit of that season. By having the\r\ncommand of the combs, the queen in my hives can always be caught and\r\ndeprived of her wings; thus she cannot go off with a swarm, and they\r\nwill not leave without her.\r\n\r\n38. It should enable the Apiarian, if he allows his bees to swarm, and\r\nwishes to secure surplus honey, to prevent them from throwing more than\r\none swarm in a season.\r\n\r\nSecond and third swarms must be returned to the old stock, if the\r\nlargest quantities of surplus honey are to be realized. It is\r\ntroublesome to watch them, deprive them of their queens, and restore\r\nthem to the parent hive. They often issue with new queens again and\r\nagain; and waste, in this way, both their own time, and that of their\r\nkeeper. \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\" In my hives,\r\nas soon as the first swarm has issued, and been hived, all the queen\r\ncells except one, in the hive from which it came, may be cut out, and\r\nthus all after-swarming will very easily and effectually be prevented.\r\n(See Chapter on Artificial Swarming, for the use to which these\r\nsupernumerary queens may be put.) When the old stock is left with but\r\none queen, she runs no risk of being killed or crippled in a contest\r\nwith rivals. By such contests, a colony is often left without a queen,\r\nor in possession of one which is too much maimed to be of any service.\r\n(See Chapter on the Loss of the Queen.)\r\n\r\n39. A good hive should enable the Apiarian, if he relies on natural\r\nswarming, and wishes to multiply his colonies as fast as possible, to\r\nmake vigorous stocks of all his small after-swarms.\r\n\r\nSuch swarms contain a young queen, and if they can be judiciously\r\nstrengthened, usually make the best stock hives. If hived in a common\r\nhive, and left to themselves, unless very early, or in very favorable\r\nseasons, they seldom thrive. They generally desert their hives, or\r\nperish in the winter. If they are small, they cannot be made powerful,\r\neven by the most generous feeding. There are too few bees to build comb,\r\nand take care of the eggs which a healthy queen can lay; and when fed,\r\nthey are apt to fill with honey, the cells in which young bees ought to\r\nbe raised; thus making the kindness of their owner serve only to hasten\r\ntheir destruction. My hives enable me to supply all such swarms at once\r\nwith combs containing bee-bread, honey and brood almost mature. They are\r\nthus made strong, and flourish as well, nay, often better than the first\r\nswarms which have an old queen, whose fertility is generally not so\r\ngreat as that of a young one.\r\n\r\n40. It should enable the Apiarian to multiply his colonies with a\r\ncertainty and rapidity which are entirely out of the question, if he\r\ndepends upon natural swarming. (See Chapter on Artificial Swarming.)\r\n\r\n41. It should enable the Apiarian to supply destitute colonies with the\r\nmeans of obtaining a new queen.\r\n\r\nEvery Apiarian would find it, for this reason, if for no other, to his\r\nadvantage to possess, at least, one such hive. (See Chapters on\r\nPhysiology, and loss of Queen.)\r\n\r\n42. It should enable him to catch the queen, for any purpose; especially\r\nto remove an old one whose fertility is impaired by age, that her place\r\nmay be supplied with a young one. (See Chapter on Artificial Swarming.)\r\n\r\n43. While a good hive is adapted to the wants of those who desire to\r\nenter upon bee-keeping on a large scale, or at least to manage their\r\ncolonies on the most improved plans, it ought to be suited to the wants\r\nof those who are too timid, too ignorant, or for any reason indisposed,\r\nto manage them in any other than the common way.\r\n\r\n44. It should enable a single individual to superintend the colonies of\r\nmany different persons.\r\n\r\nMany would like to keep bees, if they could have them taken care of, by\r\nthose who would undertake their management, just as a gardener does the\r\ngardens and grounds of his employers. No person can agree to do this\r\nwith the common hives. If the bees are allowed to swarm, he may be\r\ncalled in a dozen different directions, and if any accident, such as the\r\nloss of a queen, happens to the colonies of his customers, he can apply\r\nno remedy. If the bees are in non-swarming hives, he cannot multiply the\r\nstocks when this is desired.\r\n\r\nOn my plan, gentlemen who desire it, may have the pleasure of witnessing\r\nthe industry and sagacity of this wonderful insect, and of gratifying\r\ntheir palates with its delicious stores, harvested on their own\r\npremises, without incurring either trouble or risk of injury.\r\n\r\n45. All the joints of the hive should be water-tight, and there should\r\nbe no doors or slides which are liable to shrink, swell, or get out of\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this will be sufficiently obvious to any one who has\r\nhad the ordinary share of vexatious experience in the use of such\r\nfixtures.\r\n\r\n46. It should enable the bee-keeper entirely to dispense with sheds, and\r\ncostly Apiaries; as each hive when properly placed, should alike defy,\r\nheat or cold, rain or snow. (See Chapter on Protection.)\r\n\r\n47. It should allow the contents of a hive, bees, combs and all, to be\r\ntaken out; so that any necessary repairs may be made.\r\n\r\nThis may be done, with my hives, in a few minutes. \"A stitch in time\r\nsaves nine.\" Hives which can be thoroughly overhauled and repaired, from\r\ntime to time, if properly attended to, will last for generations.\r\n\r\n48. The hive and fixtures should present a neat and attractive\r\nappearance, and should admit, when desired, of being made highly\r\nornamental.\r\n\r\n49. The hives ought not to be liable to be blown down in high winds.\r\n\r\nMy hives, being very low in proportion to their other dimensions, it\r\nwould require almost a hurricane to upset them.\r\n\r\n50. It should enable an Apiarian who lives in the neighborhood of human\r\npilferers, to lock up the precious contents of his hives, in some cheap,\r\nsimple and convenient way.\r\n\r\nA couple of padlocks with some cheap fixtures, will suffice to secure a\r\nlong range of hives.\r\n\r\n51. A good hive should be protected against the destructive ravages of\r\nmice in winter.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost incredible that so puny an animal should dare to invade\r\na hive of bees; and yet not unfrequently they slip in when the bees are\r\ncompelled by the cold to retreat from the entrance. Having once found\r\nadmission, they build themselves a nest in their comfortable abode, eat\r\nup the honey, and such bees as are too much chilled to make any\r\nresistance; and fill the premises with such an abominable stench, that\r\non the approach of warm weather, the bees often in a body abandon their\r\ndesecrated home. As soon as the cold weather approaches, all my hives\r\nmay have their entrances either entirely closed, or so contracted that\r\na mouse cannot gain admission.\r\n\r\n52. A good hive should have its alighting board constructed so as to\r\nshelter the bees against wind and wet, and thus to facilitate to the\r\nutmost their entrance when they come home with their heavy burdens.\r\n\r\nIf this precaution is neglected, much valuable time and many lives will\r\nbe sacrificed, as the colony cannot be encouraged to use to the best\r\nadvantage the unpromising days which so often occur in the working\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nI have succeeded in arranging my alighting board in such a manner that\r\nthe bees are sheltered against wind and wet, and are able to enter the\r\nhive with the least possible loss of time.\r\n\r\n53. A well constructed hive ought to admit of being shut up in winter,\r\nso as to consign the bees to darkness and repose.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more hazardous than to shut up closely an ill protected\r\nhive. Even if the bees have an abundance of air, it will not answer to\r\nprevent them from flying out, if they are so disposed. As soon as the\r\nwarmth penetrating their thin hives tempts them to fly, they crowd to\r\nthe entrance, and if it is shut, multitudes worry themselves to death in\r\ntrying to get out, and the whole colony is liable to become diseased.\r\n\r\nIn my hives as soon as the bees are shut up for Winter, they are most\r\neffectually protected against all atmospheric changes, and never\r\n_desire_ to leave their hives until the entrances are again opened, on\r\nthe return of suitable weather. Thus they pass the Winter in a state of\r\nalmost absolute repose; they eat much less honey[12] than when wintered\r\non the ordinary plan; a much smaller number die in the hives; none are\r\nlost upon the snow, and they are more healthy, and commence breeding\r\nmuch earlier than they do in the common hives. As some of the holes into\r\nthe Protector are left open in Winter, any bee that is diseased and\r\nwishes to leave the hive can do so. Bees when diseased have a strange\r\npropensity to leave their hives, just as animals when sick seek to\r\nretreat from their companions; and in Summer such bees may often be seen\r\nforsaking their home to perish on the ground. If all egress from the\r\nhive in Winter is prevented, the diseased bees will not be able to\r\ncomply with an instinct which urges them \"To leave their country for\r\ntheir country's good.\"\r\n\r\n54. It should possess all these requisites without being too costly for\r\ncommon bee-keepers, or too complicated to be constructed by any one who\r\ncan handle simple tools: and they should be so combined that the result\r\nis a simple hive, which any one can manage who has ordinary intelligence\r\non the subject of bees.\r\n\r\nI suppose that the very natural conclusion from reading this long list\r\nof desirables, would be that no single hive can combine them all,\r\nwithout being exceedingly complicated and expensive. On the contrary,\r\nthe simplicity and cheapness with which my hive secures all these\r\nresults, is one of its most striking peculiarities, the attainment of\r\nwhich has cost me more study than all the other points besides. As far\r\nas the bees are concerned, they can work in this hive with even greater\r\nfacility than in the simple old-fashioned box, as the frames are left\r\nrough by the saw, and thus give an admirable support to the bees when\r\nbuilding their combs; and they can enter the spare honey boxes, with\r\neven more ease than if they were merely continuations of the main hive.\r\n\r\nThere are a few desirables to which my hive makes not the slightest\r\npretensions! It promises no splendid results to those who purchase it,\r\nand yet are too ignorant, or too careless to be entrusted with the\r\nmanagement of bees. In bee-keeping, as in other things, a man must first\r\nunderstand his business, and then proceed on the good old maxim, that\r\n\"the hand of the diligent maketh rich.\"\r\n\r\nIt possesses no talismanic influence by which it can convert a bad\r\nsituation for honey, into a good one; or give the Apiarian an abundant\r\nharvest whether the season is productive or otherwise.\r\n\r\nIt cannot enable the cultivator rapidly to multiply his stocks, and yet\r\nto secure, the same season, surplus honey from his bees. As well might\r\nthe breeder of poultry pretend that he can, in the same year, both raise\r\nthe greatest number of chickens, and sell the largest number of eggs.\r\n\r\nWorse than all, it cannot furnish the many advantages enumerated, and\r\nyet be made in as little time, or quite as cheap as a hive which proves,\r\nin the end, to be a very dear bargain.\r\n\r\nI have not constructed my hive in accordance with crude theories, or\r\nmere conjectures, and then insisted that the bees must flourish in such\r\na fanciful contrivance; but I have studied, for many years, most\r\ncarefully, the nature of the honey-bee; and have diligently compared my\r\nobservations with those of writers and practical cultivators, who have\r\nspent their lives in extending the sphere of Apiarian knowledge; and as\r\nthe result, have endeavored to adapt my hive to the actual wants and\r\nhabits of the bee; and to remedy the many difficulties with which I have\r\nfound its successful culture to be beset. And more than this, I have\r\nactually tested by experiments long continued and on a large scale, the\r\nmerits of this hive, that I might not deceive both myself and others,\r\nand add another to the many useless contrivances which have deluded and\r\ndisgusted a credulous public. I would, however, most earnestly repudiate\r\nall claims to having devised a \"perfect bee-hive.\" Perfection can belong\r\nonly to the works of the great Creator, to whose Omniscient eye, all\r\ncauses and effects with all their relations, were present, when he\r\nspake, and from nothing formed the universe and all its glorious\r\nwonders. For man to stamp upon any of his own works, the label of\r\nperfection, is to show both his folly and presumption.\r\n\r\nIt must be confessed that the culture of bees is at a very low ebb in\r\nour country, when thousands can be induced to purchase hives which are\r\nin most glaring opposition not only to the true principles of Apiarian\r\nknowledge, but often, to the plainest dictates of simple common sense.\r\nSuch have been the losses and disappointments of deluded purchasers,\r\nthat it is no wonder that they turn from everything offered in the shape\r\nof a patent bee-hive, as a miserable humbug, if not a most bare-faced\r\ncheat.\r\n\r\nI do not hesitate to say that those old-fashioned bee-keepers, who have\r\nmost steadily refused to meddle with any novelties, and who have used\r\nhives of the very simplest construction, or at least such as are only\r\none remove from the old straw hive, or wooden box, have, as a general\r\nthing, realized by far the largest profits in the management of bees.\r\nThey have lost neither time, money nor bees, in the vain hope of\r\nobtaining any unusual results from hives, which, in the very nature of\r\nthe case, can secure nothing really in advance of what can be\r\naccomplished by a simple box-hive with an upper chamber.\r\n\r\n_A hive of the simplest possible construction_, is only a close\r\nimitation of the abode of bees in a state of nature; being a mere hollow\r\nreceptacle in which they are protected from the weather, and where they\r\ncan lay up their stores.\r\n\r\n_An improved hive_ is one which contains, in addition, a separate\r\napartment in which the bees can be induced to lay up the surplus portion\r\nof their stores, for the use of their owner. All the various hives in\r\ncommon use, are only modifications of this latter hive, and, as a\r\ngeneral rule, they are bad, exactly in proportion as they depart from\r\nit. Not one of them offers any remedy for the loss of the queen, or\r\nindeed for most of the casualties to which bees are exposed: they form\r\nno reliable basis for any new system of management; and hence the\r\ncultivation of bees, is substantially where it was, fifty years ago, and\r\nthe Apiarian as entirely dependent as ever, upon all the whims and\r\ncaprices of an insect which may be made completely subject to his\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nNo hive which does not furnish a thorough control over every comb, can\r\nbe considered as any substantial advance on the simple improved or\r\nchamber hive. Of all such hives, the one which with the least expense,\r\ngives the greatest amount of protection, and the readiest access to the\r\nspare honey boxes, is the best.\r\n\r\nHaving thus enumerated the tests to which all hives ought to be\r\nsubjected, and by which they should stand or fall, I submit them to the\r\ncandid examination of practical, common sense bee-keepers, who have had\r\nthe largest experience in the management of bees, and are most\r\nconversant with the evils of the present system; and who are therefore\r\nbest fitted to apply them to an invention, which, if I may be pardoned\r\nfor using the enthusiastic language of an experienced Apiarian on\r\nexamining its practical workings, \"introduces, not simply an\r\n_improvement_, but a _revolution_ in bee-keeping.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] A writer in the New England Farmer for March, 1853, estimates that\r\nthe mild winter has been worth in the saving of fodder to the farmers of\r\nNew Hampshire alone, two and a half millions of dollars! By suitable\r\narrangements, bees even in the very coldest climates can have all the\r\nadvantages of a mild winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPROTECTION AGAINST EXTREMES OF HEAT AND COLD, SUDDEN AND SEVERE CHANGES\r\nOF TEMPERATURE, AND DAMPNESS IN THE HIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI specially invite a careful perusal of this chapter, as the subject,\r\nthough of the very first importance in the management of bees, is one to\r\nwhich but little attention has been given by the majority of\r\ncultivators.\r\n\r\nIn our climate of great and sudden extremes, many colonies are annually\r\ninjured or destroyed by undue exposure to heat or cold. In Summer, thin\r\nhives are often exposed to the direct heat of the sun, so that the combs\r\nmelt, and the bees are drowned in their own sweets. Even if they escape\r\nutter ruin, they cannot work to advantage in the almost suffocating heat\r\nof their hives.\r\n\r\nBut in those places where the Winters are both long and severe, it is\r\nmuch more difficult to protect the bees from the cold than from the\r\nheat. Bees are not, as some suppose, in a _dormant_, or _torpid_\r\ncondition in Winter. It must be remembered that they were intended to\r\nlive in colonies, in Winter, as well as Summer. The wasp, hornet, and\r\nother insects which do not live in families in the Winter, lay up no\r\nstores for cold weather, and are so organized as to be able to endure in\r\na torpid state, a very low temperature; so low that it would be certain\r\ndeath to a honey-bee, which when frozen, is as surely killed as a frozen\r\nman.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the temperature of the hives falls too low for their comfort,\r\nthe bees gather themselves into a more compact body, to preserve to the\r\nutmost, their animal heat; and if the cold becomes so great that this\r\nwill not suffice, they keep up an incessant, tremulous motion,\r\naccompanied by a loud humming noise; in other words, they take active\r\nexercise in order to keep warm! If a thermometer is pushed up among\r\nthem, it will indicate a high temperature, even when the external\r\natmosphere is many degrees below zero. When the bees are unable to\r\nmaintain the necessary amount of animal heat, an occurrence which is\r\nvery common with small colonies in badly protected hives, then, as a\r\nmatter of course, they must perish.\r\n\r\nExtreme cold, when of long continuance, very frequently destroys\r\ncolonies in thin hives, even when they are strong both in bees and\r\nhoney. The inside of such hives, is often filled with frost, and the\r\nbees, after eating all the food in the combs in which they are\r\nclustered, are unable to enter the frosty combs, and thus starve in the\r\nmidst of plenty. The unskilfull bee-keeper who finds an abundance of\r\nhoney in the hives, cannot conjecture the cause of their death.\r\n\r\nIf the cold merely destroyed feeble colonies, or strong ones only now\r\nand then, it would not be so formidable an enemy; but every year, it\r\ncauses many of the most flourishing stocks to perish by starvation. The\r\nextra quantity of food which they are compelled to eat, in order to keep\r\nup their heat in their miserable hives, is often the turning point with\r\nthem, between life and death. They starve, when with proper protection,\r\nthey would have had food enough and to spare.\r\n\r\nBut some one may say, \"What possible difference can the kind of hives in\r\nwhich bees are kept make in the quantity of food which they will\r\nconsume?\" Enough, I would reply, in some single winters, to pay the\r\ndifference between a good hive and a bad one!\r\n\r\nI cannot move my finger, or wink my eye-lids without some waste of\r\nmuscle, however small; for it is a well-ascertained law in our animal\r\neconomy, that all _muscular exertion_ is attended with a corresponding\r\n_waste_ of muscular fibre. Now this waste must be supplied by the\r\nconsumption of food, and it would be as unreasonable to expect constant\r\nheat from a stove without fresh supplies of fuel, as incessant muscular\r\nactivity from an insect, without a supply of food proportioned to that\r\nactivity. If then we can contrive any way to keep our bees in almost\r\nperfect quiet during the Winter, we may be certain that they will need\r\nmuch less food than when they are constantly excited.\r\n\r\nIn the cold Winter of 1851-2, I kept two swarms in a perfectly dry and\r\ndark cellar, where the temperature was remarkably uniform, seldom\r\nvarying two degrees from 50° of Fahrenheit; and I found that the bees\r\nate very little honey. The hives were of glass, and the bees, when\r\nexamined from time to time, were found clustered in almost death-like\r\nrepose. If these bees had been exposed in thin hives in the open air,\r\nthey would, in all probability, have eaten four times as much; for\r\nwhenever the sun shone upon them, or the atmosphere was unusually warm,\r\nthey would have been roused to injurious activity, and the same would\r\nhave been the case, when the cold was severe. Exposed to sudden changes\r\nand severe cold, they would have been in almost perpetual motion, and\r\nmust have been compelled to consume a largely increased quantity of\r\nfood. In this way, many colonies are annually starved to death, which if\r\nthey had been better protected, would have survived to gladden their\r\nowner with an abundant harvest. This protection, as a general thing,\r\nmust be given to them in the open air, for it is a very rare thing, to\r\nmeet with a cellar which is dry enough to prevent the combs from\r\nmoulding, and the bees from becoming diseased.\r\n\r\nBees never, unless diseased, discharge their fæces in the hive; and the\r\nwant of suitable protection, by exciting undue activity, and compelling\r\nthem to eat more freely, causes their bodies to be greatly distended\r\nwith accumulated fæces. On the return of warm weather, bees in this\r\ncondition being often too feeble to fly, crawl from their hives, and\r\nmiserably perish.\r\n\r\nI must notice another exceedingly injurious effect of insufficient\r\nprotection, in causing the _moisture_ to settle upon the cold top and\r\nsides of the interior of the hive, from whence it drips upon the bees.\r\nIn this way, many of their number are chilled and destroyed, and often\r\nthe whole colony is infected with dysentery. Not unfrequently, large\r\nportions of the comb are covered with mould, and the whole hive is\r\nrendered very offensive.\r\n\r\nThis dampness which causes what may be called a _rot_ among the bees, is\r\none of the worst enemies with which the Apiarian in a cold climate, has\r\nto contend, as it weakens or destroys many of his best colonies. No\r\nextreme of cold ever experienced in latitudes where bees flourish, can\r\ndestroy a strong colony well supplied with honey, except indirectly, by\r\nconfining them to empty combs. They will survive our coldest winters, in\r\nthin hives raised on blocks to give a freer admission of air, or even in\r\nsuspended hives, without any bottom-board at all. Indeed, in cold\r\nweather, a _very free_ admission of air is necessary in such hives, to\r\nprevent the otherwise ruinous effects of frozen moisture; and hence the\r\ncommon remark that bees require as much or more air in Winter than in\r\nSummer.\r\n\r\nWhen bees, in unsuitable hives, are exposed to all the variations of the\r\nexternal atmosphere, they are frequently tempted to fly abroad if the\r\nweather becomes unseasonably warm, and multitudes are lost on the\r\n_snow_, at a season when no young are bred to replenish their number,\r\nand when the loss is most injurious to the colony.\r\n\r\nFrom these remarks, it will be obvious to the intelligent cultivator,\r\nthat protection against extremes of heat and cold, is a point of the\r\nVERY FIRST IMPORTANCE; and yet this is the very point, which, in\r\nproportion to its importance, has been most overlooked. We have\r\ndiscarded, and very wisely, the straw hives of our ancestors; but such\r\nhives, with all their faults, were comparatively warm in Winter, and\r\ncool in Summer. We have undertaken to keep bees, where the cold of\r\nWinter, and the heat of Summer are alike intense; and where sudden and\r\nsevere changes are often fatal to the brood: and yet we blindly persist\r\nin expecting success under circumstances in which any marked success is\r\nwell nigh impossible.\r\n\r\nThat our country is eminently favorable to the production of honey,\r\ncannot be doubted. Many of our forests abound With colonies which are\r\nnot only able to protect themselves against all their enemies, the\r\ndreaded bee-moth not excepted, but which often amass prodigious\r\nquantities of honey. Nor are such colonies found merely in _new_\r\ncountries. They exist frequently in the very neighborhood of cultivators\r\nwhose hives are weak and impoverished, and who impute to a decay of the\r\nhoney resources of the country, the inevitable consequences of their own\r\nirrational system of management. It will not be without profit, to\r\nconsider briefly under what circumstances these wild colonies flourish,\r\nand how they are protected against sudden and extreme changes of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nSnugly housed in the hollow of a tree whose thickness and decayed\r\ninterior are such admirable materials for excluding atmospheric changes,\r\nthe bees in Winter are in a state of almost absolute repose. The\r\nentrance to their abode is generally very small in proportion to the\r\nspace within; and let the weather out of doors vary as it may, the\r\ninside temperature is very uniform. These natural hives are dry, because\r\nthe moisture finds no cold or icy top, or sides, on which to condense,\r\nand from which it must drip upon the bees, destroying their lives, or\r\nenfeebling their health, by filling the interior of their dwelling with\r\nmould and dampness. As they are very quiet, they eat but little, and\r\nhence their bodies are not distended and diseased by accumulated fæces.\r\nOften they do not stir from their hollows, from November until March or\r\nApril; and yet they come forth in the Spring, strong in numbers, and\r\nvigorous in health. If at any time in the winter season, the warmth is\r\nso great as to penetrate their comfortable abodes, and to tempt them to\r\nfly, when they venture out, they find a balmy atmosphere in which they\r\nmay disport with impunity. In the Summer, they are protected from the\r\nheat, not merely by the thickness of the hollow tree, but by the leafy\r\nshade of overarching branches, and the refreshing coolness of a forest\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThe Russian and Polish bee-keepers, living in a climate whose winters\r\nare much more severe than our own, are among the largest and most\r\nsuccessful cultivators of bees, many of them numbering their colonies by\r\nhundreds, and some even by thousands!\r\n\r\nThey have, with great practical sagacity, imitated as closely as\r\npossible, the conditions under which bees are found to flourish so\r\nadmirably in a state of nature. We are informed by Mr. Dohiogost, a\r\nPolish writer, that his countrymen make their hives of the best plank,\r\nand never less than an inch and a half in thickness. The shape is that\r\nof an old-fashioned churn, and the hive is covered on the outside,\r\nhalfway down, with twisted rope cordage, to give it greater protection\r\nagainst extremes of heat and cold. The hives are placed in a dry\r\nsituation, directly upon the hard earth, which is first covered with an\r\ninch or two of clean, dry sand. Chips are then heaped up all around\r\nthem, and covered with earth banked up in a sloping direction to carry\r\noff the rain. The entrance is at some distance above the bottom, and is\r\na triangle, whose sides are only one inch long. In the winter season,\r\nthis entrance is contracted so that only one bee can pass at a time.\r\nSuch a hive, with us, as it does not furnish the honey in convenient,\r\nbeautiful and salable forms, would not meet the demands of our\r\ncultivators. Still, there are some very important lessons to be learned\r\nfrom it, by all who keep bees in regions of cold winters, and hot\r\nsummers. It shows the importance which some of the largest Apiarians in\r\nthe world, attach to protection; practical, common sense men, whose\r\nheads have not been turned, as some would express it, by modern theories\r\nand fanciful inventions. They cultivate their bees almost in a state of\r\nnature, and their experience on what we would term a gigantic scale,\r\nought to convince even the most incredulous, of the folly of pretending\r\nto keep bees, in the miserably thin and unprotected hives to which we\r\nhave been accustomed.\r\n\r\nBut how, it will be asked, can bees live in Winter, in a hive so closely\r\nshut up as the Polish hive? They do live in such hives, and prosper,\r\njust as they do in hollow trees, with only one small entrance. It is\r\nwell known that bees have flourished when their hives were buried in\r\nWinter, and under circumstances in which but a very small amount of air\r\ncould possibly gain admission to them. Bees, when kept in a _dry_ place,\r\nin properly protected hives and in a state of almost perfect repose,\r\nneed only a small supply of air; and the objection that those\r\ncultivators among us, who shut up their colonies very closely in Winter,\r\nare almost sure to lose them, is of no weight; because the majority of\r\nour hives are so deficient in protection, that if they are too closely\r\nshut up, \"the breath of the bees,\" condensing and freezing upon the\r\ninside, and afterwards thawing, causes the combs to mould, and the bees\r\nto become diseased; just as many substances mould and perish when kept\r\nin a close, damp cellar.\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to discuss the question of protection in its\r\nrelations to the construction of hives. We have seen how it is furnished\r\nto the bees in the Polish hives, and in the decayed hollows of trees. If\r\nthe Apiarian chooses, he can imitate this plan by constructing his hives\r\nof very thick plank: but such hives would be clumsy, and with us,\r\nexpensive. Or he may much more effectually reach the same end, by making\r\nhis hives double, so as to enclose an air space all around, which in\r\nWinter may be filled with charcoal, plaster of Paris, straw, or any good\r\nnon-conductor, to enable the bees to preserve with the least waste,\r\ntheir animal heat. I prefer to pack the air-space with plaster of Paris,\r\nas it is one of the very best non-conductors of heat, being used in the\r\nmanufacture of the celebrated Salamander fire-proof safes. Hives may be\r\nconstructed in this way, which without great expense, may be much better\r\nprotected than if they were made of six-inch plank. As the price of\r\nglass is very low, I prefer to construct the inside of my doubled hives\r\nof this material. When a number of hives are to be made, as the lowest\r\nprice glass will answer every purpose, I can furnish a given amount of\r\nprotection cheaper with glass than wood, while the glass possesses some\r\nmost decided advantages over any other material. The hives are lighter\r\nand more compact, than when made of doubled wood, and can be more easily\r\nmoved, while the Apiarian can gratify his rational curiosity, and\r\ninspect at all times, the condition of his stocks. The very interest\r\ninspired by being able to see what they are doing, will go far to\r\nprotect them from that indifference and neglect, which is so often fatal\r\nto their prosperity. The way in which I make my hives, not only protects\r\nthe bees against extremes of heat and cold, but it guards them very\r\neffectually, against the injurious and often fatal effects of condensed\r\nmoisture. By means of my movable frames, the combs are prevented from\r\nbeing attached to the sides, top or bottom of the hive; they are in\r\nfact, suspended in the air. If now the dampness can be prevented from\r\ncondensing any where, _over_ the bees, so that it may not drip upon\r\ntheir combs, and if it can be easily discharged from the hive wherever\r\nit may collect, it cannot, under any circumstances, seriously annoy\r\nthem. Such are the arrangements in my hives, that but very little\r\nmoisture forms in them, and all that does, is deposited on the sides in\r\npreference to any other part of the interior; just as it is upon the\r\ncolder walls or windows, rather than the ceiling of a room. But as the\r\ncombs are kept away from the sides, this moisture cannot annoy the bees;\r\nnor can it penetrate the glass as it does unpainted wood or straw, thus\r\ncausing a more protracted dampness; it must run down their smooth\r\nsurfaces, and fall upon the bottom-board, from whence it can be easily\r\ndischarged from the hive. By packing in winter, the necessary amount of\r\nprotection is secured for the top and sides of the hive, and the very\r\nworst property of glass, (its parting so rapidly with heat,) is changed\r\ninto one of the very best for the purposes of a bee-hive. I prefer not\r\nonly to make the sides of my hive of glass, but of _double_ glass, with\r\nan air space of about an inch between the two panes of glass. The extra\r\ncost[13] of this construction will be amply repaid by the additional\r\nprotection given to the bees. It will be absolutely impossible for any\r\nfrost ever to penetrate through this air space, and the packing between\r\nthe outside case and the main hive. The combs in such a hive cannot be\r\nmelted down, even if the hive is exposed to the reflected and\r\nconcentrated heat of a blazing sun: the same construction which secures\r\nthem against the cold of Winter, equally protecting them from the heat\r\nof Summer. There is one disadvantage to which all well protected hives\r\nof the ordinary construction, are exposed. In the Spring of the year, it\r\nis exceedingly desirable that the warmth of the sun should penetrate the\r\nhives, to encourage the bees in early breeding; but the very arrangement\r\nwhich protects them from cold, often interferes with this. A bee-hive is\r\nthus like a cellar, warm in Winter, and cool in Summer; but often\r\nunpleasantly cool in the early Spring, when the atmosphere out of doors\r\nis warm and delightful. In my hive, this difficulty is easily remedied.\r\nIn the Spring, as soon as the bees begin to fly, on warm, sun-shiny\r\ndays, the upper part of the outside case is removed, so that the genial\r\nheat of the sun can penetrate to every part of the hive. The cover must\r\nbe replaced while the sun is still shining, so that the hives may be\r\nshut up while they are warm. The labor of doing this, need occupy only a\r\nfew minutes daily, and as soon as warm weather fairly sets in, it may be\r\ndispensed with. It may be performed without any risk, by a woman or a\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nIf the hive is of glass, it will warm up all the better, and as the\r\ncombs are on frames, they cannot be melted or injured by the heat. It is\r\na serious objection to most covered Apiaries, that they do not permit\r\nthe hives to receive the genial heat of the sun at a period of the year\r\nwhen instead of injuring the bees, it exerts a most powerful influence\r\nin developing their brood.\r\n\r\nThis is one among many reasons why I have discarded them, and why I\r\nprefer to construct my hives in such a manner that they need no extra\r\ncovering, but stand exposed to the full influence of the sun. I have\r\nknown strong colonies which have survived the Winter in thin hives, to\r\nincrease rapidly and swarm early, because of the stimulating effect of\r\nthe sun; while others, deprived of this influence, in dark bee houses\r\nand well protected hives, have sometimes disappointed the hopes of their\r\nowners. Although my glass hives are very beautiful, and most admirably\r\nprotected, still hives of doubled wood may often be built to better\r\nadvantage by those who construct their own hives, and they can be made\r\nto furnish any desirable amount of protection.\r\n\r\nEnclosed Apiaries are at best but nuisances: they soon become\r\nlurking-places for spiders and moths; and after all the expense wasted\r\non their construction, afford, but little protection against extreme\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular on the subject of protection, in order to\r\nconvince every bee keeper who exercises common sense, that thin hives\r\nought to be given up, if either pleasure or profit is sought from his\r\nbees. Such hives an enlightened Apiarian could not be persuaded to\r\npurchase, and he would consider them too expensive in their waste of\r\nhoney and bees, to be worth accepting, even as a gift. Many strong\r\ncolonies which are lodged in badly protected hives, often consume in\r\nextra food, in a single hard winter, more than enough to pay the\r\ndifference between the first cost of a good hive over a bad one. In the\r\nsevere winter of 1851-2, many cultivators lost nearly all their stocks,\r\nand a large part of those which survived, were too much weakened to be\r\nable to swarm. And yet these same miserable hives, after accomplishing\r\nthe work of destruction on one generation of bees, are reserved to\r\nperform the same office for another. And this some call economy!\r\n\r\nI am well aware of the question which many of my readers have for some\r\ntime been ready to ask of me. Can you make one of your well protected\r\nhives as cheaply as we construct our common hives? I would remind such\r\nquestioners, that it is hardly possible to build a well protected house\r\nas cheaply as a barn.\r\n\r\nAnd yet by building my hives in solid structures, three together, I am\r\nable to make them for a very moderate price, and still to give them even\r\nbetter protection than when they are constructed singly. If they are not\r\nbuilt of doubled materials they can be made for as little money as any\r\nother patent hive, and yet afford much greater protection; as the combs\r\ntouch neither the top, bottom nor sides of the hive. I recommend however\r\na construction, which although somewhat more costly at first, is yet\r\nmuch cheaper in the end.\r\n\r\nSuch is the passion of the American people for cheapness in the first\r\ncost of an article, even at the evident expense of dearness in the end,\r\nthat many, I doubt not, will continue to lodge their bees in thin hives,\r\nin spite of their conviction of the folly of so doing; just as many of\r\nour shrewdest Yankees build thin wooden houses, in the cold climate of\r\nNew England, or plaster their stone or brick ones directly on the wall,\r\nwhen the extra cost of fuel to warm them, far exceeds the interest on\r\nthe additional expense which would be necessary to give them the\r\nrequisite protection; to say nothing of the doctors' bills, and fatal\r\ndiseases which can be traced often to the dreary barns or damp vaults\r\nwhich they build, and call houses!\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTOR.\r\n\r\nI attach very great importance to the way in which I give the bees\r\neffectual protection against extremes of heat and cold, and sudden\r\nchanges of temperature, without removing them from their stands, or\r\nincurring the expense and disadvantages of a covered Bee-House. This I\r\naccomplish by means of what I shall call a _Protector_ which is\r\nconstructed substantially as follows.\r\n\r\nSelect a dry and suitable location for the bees, where they will not be\r\ndisturbed, or prove an annoyance to others. If possible, let it be in\r\nfull sight of the sitting room, so that they may be seen in case of\r\nswarming; and let it face the South-East, and be well protected from the\r\nforce of strong winds. Dig a trench, about two feet deep; its length\r\nshould depend upon the number of hives to be accommodated; and its\r\nbreadth should be such that when it is properly walled up, it should\r\nmeasure from the outside top of one wall to another, just sufficient to\r\nreceive the bottom of the hive. The walls, may be built of refuse brick\r\nor stones, and should be about four feet high from the foundation; the\r\nupper six inches being built of good brick, and the back wall about two\r\ninches higher than the front one, so as to give the bottom-board of the\r\nhives, the proper slant towards the entrance. At one end of this\r\nProtector, a wooden chimney should be built, and if the number of hives\r\nis great, there should be one at each end, admitting air in Winter, and\r\nyet excluding rain and snow. The earth which is thrown out in digging,\r\nshould be banked up against the walls as high as the good brick, and in\r\na slope which, when grassed over, may be easily mowed with a common\r\nscythe. The slope on the back should be more perpendicular than in front\r\nso as not to be in the way when operating upon the hives.\r\n\r\nThe bottom may be covered with an inch or two of clean sand and in\r\nwinter with straw. In Summer, the ends are left open, so that a free\r\ncurrent of air may pass through, while in Winter, they are properly\r\nbanked up; and straw, evergreen boughs, or any other material, suitable\r\nfor excluding frost, may if necessary, be placed all around the outside\r\nof the Protector. Such an arrangement will be found very cheap, when\r\ncompared with a Bee-House or covered Apiary, and may be made both neat\r\nand highly ornamental. It may be constructed of wood by those who desire\r\nsomething still cheaper, and any one who can handle a spade, hammer,\r\nplane and saw, can make for himself a structure on which a hundred hives\r\nmay stand, at less expense than would be necessary to build a covered\r\nApiary for ten. As the ventilators of the hive open into this Protector,\r\nthe bees are, in Summer, supplied with a cool and refreshing atmosphere,\r\nas closely as possible resembling that which they find in a forest home;\r\nwhile in Winter, the external entrances of the hives may be safely\r\nclosed, and they will receive a supply of air remarkably uniform and\r\nnever much below the freezing point. As the hives themselves are double,\r\nno frost can penetrate through them, and thus their interior will almost\r\nalways be perfectly dry. When the weather suddenly moderates, and bees\r\nin the common hives fly out, and are lost on the snow, those arranged in\r\nthe manner described, will not know that any change has taken place,\r\nbut will remain quiet in their winter quarters, unless the weather is so\r\nwarm that their owner judges it safe to open the entrances, so that the\r\nwarmth may penetrate their hives, and tempt them to fly, and discharge\r\ntheir fæces. Let it be remembered that the object of this arrangement is\r\nnot to _warm up_ the hives by _artificial heat_; but merely to enable\r\nthe bees to retain to the utmost their own animal heat, to secure the\r\nadvantages set forth in this Chapter on Protection. Once or twice during\r\nthe Winter, the blocks which regulate the entrances to my hives should\r\nbe removed, and as the frames are kept about half an inch from the\r\nbottom-board, by means of a stick or wire, all the dead bees and filth\r\nmay, in a few moments, be removed: or as the entrance of the hives by\r\nremoving the blocks, may be so enlarged as to offer no obstruction to\r\nits introduction or removal, an old newspaper can be kept on the\r\nbottom-board, and drawn out from time to time, with all its contents.\r\n\r\nA movable board of the same thickness and length with the bottom-boards\r\nof the hive and about six inches wide, separates the hives from each\r\nother, as they stand upon the Protector.\r\n\r\nI have made numerous observations upon the temperature of a Protector\r\nmade substantially on the plan described, and find that it is\r\nwonderfully uniform. The lowest range of the thermometer during the\r\nmonths of January and February, 1853, in the Protector, was 28°; in the\r\nopen air, 14° below zero; the highest in the Protector 32°; in the open\r\nair 56°. It will thus be seen that while the thermometer out of doors\r\nhad a range of 70°, in the Protector it had a range of only 4°. While\r\nbees in common hives during some warm days flew out and perished in\r\nlarge numbers on the snow; the bees over the Protector were perfectly\r\nquiet. To this arrangement I attach an importance second only to my\r\nmovable frames, and believe that combined with doubled hives, it removes\r\nthe chief obstacle to the successful cultivation of bees in cold\r\nlatitudes.[14] In the coldest regions where bees can find supplies in\r\nSummer, they may during a Winter that lasts from November to May, and\r\nduring which the mercury congeals, be kept as comfortable as in climates\r\nwhich seem much more propitious for their cultivation. The more snow the\r\nbetter, as it serves more the effectually to exclude the cold from the\r\nProtector. However long and dreary the Winter, the bees in their\r\ncomfortable quarters feel none of its injurious influences; and actually\r\nconsume less, than those which are kept where the winters are short, and\r\nso mild that the bees are often tempted to fly, and are in a state of\r\nalmost continual excitement. It is in precisely such latitudes, in\r\nPoland and Russia, that bees are kept in the largest numbers, and with\r\nthe most extraordinary success. In the chapter on Pasturage, I shall\r\nshow that some of the coldest places in New England, and the Middle\r\nStates, are among the most favored spots for obtaining the largest\r\nsupplies of the very purest honey.\r\n\r\nHaving thoroughly tested the practicability of affording the bees by my\r\nProtector, complete protection against heat and cold, at a very small\r\nexpense, and in a way which may be made highly ornamental, the proper\r\nsteps will be taken to secure a patent right for the same; although no\r\nextra charge will be made for this, or for any other subsequent\r\nimprovement, to those who purchase the right to use my hive.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] The cost of the glass for one hive so as to give the air space all\r\naround, if purchased at the wholesale prices will not exceed 25 cts.\r\nWhere three hives are made in one structure, the glass for the three\r\nwill cost less than 50 cents; if double glass is not used, the expense\r\nwould be less by one half.\r\n\r\n[14] The observations to test the temperature of the Protector were made\r\nin Greenfield, Massachusetts, in latitude 42 deg. 36 min.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nVENTILATION OF THE HIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a populous hive is examined on a warm Summer day, a considerable\r\nnumber of bees will be found standing on the alighting board, with their\r\nheads turned towards the entrance, the extremity of their bodies\r\nslightly elevated, and their wings in such rapid motion that they are\r\nalmost as indistinct as the spokes of a wheel, in swift rotation on its\r\naxis. A brisk current of air may be felt proceeding from the hive, and\r\nif a small piece of down be suspended by a thread, it will be blown out\r\nfrom one part of the entrance, and drawn in at another. What are these\r\nbees expecting to accomplish, that they appear so deeply absorbed in\r\ntheir fanning occupation, while busy numbers are constantly crowding in\r\nand out of the hive? and what is the meaning of this double current of\r\nair? To Huber, we owe the first satisfactory explanation of these\r\ncurious phenomena. These bees plying their rapid wings in such a\r\nsingular attitude, are performing the important business of\r\n_ventilating_ the hive; and this double current is composed of pure air\r\nrushing in at one part, to supply the place of the foul air forced out\r\nat another. By a series of the most careful and beautiful experiments,\r\nHuber ascertained that the air of a crowded hive is almost, if not\r\nquite, as pure as the atmosphere by which it is surrounded. Now, as the\r\nentrance to such a hive, is often, (more especially in a state of\r\nnature,) very small, the interior air cannot be renewed without resort\r\nto some artificial means. If a lamp is put into a close vessel with only\r\none small orifice, it will soon exhaust all the oxygen, and go out. If\r\nanother small orifice is made, the same result will follow; but if by\r\nsome device a current of air is drawn out from one, an equal current\r\nwill force its way into the other, and the lamp will burn until the oil\r\nis exhausted.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely on this principle, of maintaining a double current by\r\n_artificial means_, that the bees ventilate their crowded habitations. A\r\nbody of active ventilators stands inside of the hive, as well as\r\noutside, all with their heads turned towards the entrance, and by the\r\nrapid fanning of their wings, a current of air is blown briskly out of\r\nthe hive, and an equal current drawn in. This important office is one\r\nwhich requires great physical exertion on the part of those to whom it\r\nis entrusted; and if their proceedings are carefully watched, it will be\r\nfound that the exhausted ventilators, are, from time to time, relieved\r\nby fresh detachments. If the interior of the hive will admit of\r\ninspection, in very hot weather, large numbers of these ventilators will\r\nbe found in regular files, in various parts of the hive, all busily\r\nengaged in their laborious employment. If the entrance at any time is\r\ncontracted, a speedy accession will be made to the numbers, both inside\r\nand outside; and if it is closed entirely, the heat of the hive will\r\nquickly increase, the whole colony will commence a rapid vibration of\r\ntheir wings, and in a few moments will drop lifeless from the combs, for\r\nwant of air.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved by careful experiments that pure air is necessary not\r\nonly for the respiration of the mature bees, but that without it,\r\nneither the eggs can be hatched, nor the larvæ developed. A fine\r\nnetting of air-vessels covers the eggs; and the cells of the larvæ are\r\nsealed over with a covering which is full of air holes. In Winter, as\r\nhas been stated in the Chapter on Protection, bees, if kept in the dark,\r\nand neither too warm nor too cold, are almost dormant, and seem to\r\nrequire but a small allowance of air; but even under such circumstances,\r\nthey cannot live entirely without air; and if they are excited by being\r\nexposed to atmospheric changes, or by being disturbed, a very loud\r\nhumming may be heard in the interior of their hives, and they need quite\r\nas much air as in warm weather.\r\n\r\nIf at any time, by moving their hives, or in any other way, bees are\r\ngreatly disturbed, it will be unsafe to confine them, especially in warm\r\nweather, unless a very free admission of air is given to them, and even\r\nthen, the air ought to be admitted above, as well as below the mass of\r\nbees, or the ventilators may become clogged with dead bees, and the\r\nswarm may perish. Under close confinement, the bees become excessively\r\nheated, and the combs are often melted down. When bees are confined to a\r\nclose atmosphere, especially if dampness is added to its injurious\r\ninfluences, they are sure to become diseased; and large numbers, if not\r\nthe whole colony, perish from dysentery. Is it not under circumstances\r\nprecisely similar, that cholera and dysentery prove most fatal to human\r\nbeings? How often do the filthy, damp and unventilated abodes of the\r\nabject poor, become perfect lazar-houses to their wretched inmates?\r\n\r\nI examined, last Summer, the bees of a new swarm which had been\r\nsuffocated for want of air, and found their bodies distended with a\r\nyellow and noisome substance, just as though they had perished from\r\ndysentery. A few were still alive, and instead of honey, their bodies\r\nwere filled with this same disgusting fluid; though the bees had not\r\nbeen shut up, more than two hours.\r\n\r\nIn a medical point of view, I consider these facts as highly\r\ninteresting; showing as they do, under what circumstances, and how\r\nspeedily, disease may be produced.\r\n\r\nIn very hot weather, if thin hives are exposed to the sun's rays, the\r\nbees are excessively annoyed by the intense heat, and have recourse to\r\nthe most powerful ventilation, not merely to keep the air of the hive\r\npure, but to carry off, as much as possible, its internal warmth. They\r\noften leave the interior of the hive, almost in a body, and in thick\r\nmasses, cluster on the outside, not simply to escape the close heat\r\nwithin, but to guard their combs against the danger of being dissolved.\r\nAt such times they are particularly careful not to cluster on the combs\r\ncontaining sealed honey; for as most of these combs have not been lined\r\nwith the cocoons of the larvæ, they are, for this reason, as well as on\r\naccount of the extra amount of wax used for their covers, much more\r\nliable to be melted, than the breeding cells.\r\n\r\nApiarians have often noticed the fact, that as a general thing, the bees\r\nleave the honey cells almost entirely bare, as soon as they have sealed\r\nthem over; but it seems to have escaped their observation, that in hot\r\nweather, there is often an absolute necessity for such a course. In cool\r\nweather, on the contrary, the bees may often be found clustered among\r\nthe sealed honey-combs, because there is then no danger of their melting\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nFew things in the range of their wonderful instincts, are so well fitted\r\nto impress the mind with their admirable sagacity, as the truly\r\nscientific device, by which these wise little insects ventilate their\r\ndwellings. I was on the point of saying that it was almost like\r\nhuman-reason, when the painful and mortifying reflection presented\r\nitself to my mind that in respect to ventilation, the bee is immensely\r\nin advance of the great mass of those who consider themselves as\r\nrational beings. It has, to be sure, no ability to make an elaborate\r\nanalysis of the chemical constituents of the atmosphere, and to decide\r\nhow large a proportion of oxygen is essential to the support of life,\r\nand how rapidly the process of breathing converts this important element\r\ninto a deadly poison. It has not, like Leibig, been able to demonstrate\r\nthat God has set the animal and vegetable world, the one over against\r\nthe other; so that the carbonic acid produced by the breathing of the\r\none, furnishes the aliment of the other; which, in turn, gives out its\r\noxygen for the support of animal life; and that, in this wonderful\r\nmanner, God has provided that the atmosphere shall, through all ages, be\r\nas pure as when it first came from His creating hand. But shame upon us!\r\nthat with all our intelligence, the most of us live as though pure air\r\nwas of little or no importance; while the bee ventilates with a\r\nscientific precision and thoroughness, that puts to the blush our\r\ncriminal neglect.\r\n\r\nTo this it may be replied that ventilation in our case, cannot be had,\r\nwithout considerable expense. Can it be had for nothing, by the\r\nindustrious bees? Those busy insects, which are so indefatigably plying\r\ntheir wings, are not engaged in idle amusement; nor might they, as some\r\nwould-be utilitarian may imagine, be better employed in gathering honey,\r\nor in superintending some other department in the economy of the hive.\r\nThey are at great expense of time and labor, supplying the rest of the\r\ncolony with pure air, so conducive in every way, to their health and\r\nprosperity.\r\n\r\nI trust that I shall be permitted to digress, for a short time, from\r\nbees to men, and that the remarks which I shall offer on the subject of\r\nventilation in human dwellings, may make a deeper impression, in\r\nconnection with the wise arrangements of the bee, than they would, if\r\npresented in the shape of a mere scientific discussion; and that some\r\nwho have been in the habit of considering all air, except in the\r\nparticular of temperature, as about alike, may be thoroughly convinced\r\nof their mistake.\r\n\r\nRecent statistics prove that consumption and its kindred diseases are\r\nmost fearfully on the increase, in the Northern, and more especially in\r\nthe New England States; and that the general mortality of Massachusetts\r\nexceeds that of almost every other state in the Union. In these States,\r\nthe tendency of increasing attention to manufacturing and mechanical\r\npursuits, is to compel a larger and larger proportion of the population\r\nto lead an in-door life, and to breathe an atmosphere more or less\r\nvitiated, and thus unfit for the full development of vigorous health.\r\nThe importance of pure air can hardly be over-estimated; indeed, the\r\nquality of the air we breath, seems to exert an influence much more\r\npowerful, and hardly less direct, than the mere quality of our food.\r\nThose who, by active exercise in the open air, keep their lungs\r\nsaturated as it were, with the pure element, can eat almost anything\r\nwith impunity; while those who breath the sorry apology for air which is\r\nto be found in so many habitations, although they may live upon the most\r\nnutritious diet, and avoid the least excess, are incessantly troubled\r\nwith head-ache, dyspepsia, and various mental as well as physical\r\nsufferings. Well may such persons, as they witness the healthy forms and\r\nhappy faces of so many of the hardy sons of toil, exclaim with the old\r\nLatin poet,\r\n\r\n    \"Oh dura messorum illia!\"\r\n\r\nIt is with the human family very much as it is with the vegetable\r\nkingdom. Take a plant or tree, and shut it out from the pure air, and\r\nthe invigorating light, and though you may supply it with an abundance\r\nof water and the very soil, which by the strictest chemical analysis, is\r\nfound to contain all the elements that are essential to its vigorous\r\ngrowth, it will still be a puny thing, ready to droop, if exposed to a\r\nsummer's sun, or to be prostrated by the first visitation of a winter's\r\nblast. Compare now, this wretched abortion, with an oak or maple which\r\nhas grown upon the comparatively sterile mountain pasture, and whose\r\nbranches, in Summer are the pleasant resort of the happy songsters,\r\nwhile, under its mighty shade, the panting herds drink in a refreshing\r\ncoolness. In Winter it laughs at the mighty storms, which wildly toss\r\nits giant branches in the air, and which serve only to exercise the\r\nlimbs of the sturdy tree, whose roots deep intertwined among its native\r\nrocks, enable it to bid defiance to anything short of a whirlwind or\r\ntornado.\r\n\r\nTo a population, who, for more than two-thirds of the year, are\r\ncompelled to breathe an atmosphere heated by artificial means, the\r\nquestion how can this air be made, at a moderate expense, to resemble,\r\nas far as possible, the purest ether of the skies is, (or as I should\r\nrather say ought to be,) a question of the utmost interest. When open\r\nfires were used, there was no lack of pure air, whatever else might have\r\nbeen deficient. A capacious chimney carried up through its insatiable\r\nthroat, immense volumes of air, to be replaced by the pure element,\r\nwhistling in glee, through every crack, crevice and keyhole. Now the\r\nhouse-builder and stove-maker with but few exceptions[15] seem to have\r\njoined hands in waging a most effectual warfare against the unwelcome\r\nintruder. By labor-saving machinery, they contrive to make the one, the\r\njoints of his wood-work, and the other, those of his iron-work, tighter\r\nand tighter, and if it were possible for them to accomplish fully their\r\nmanifest design, they would be able to furnish rooms almost as fatal\r\nto life as \"the black hole of Calcutta.\" But in spite of all that they\r\ncan do, the materials will shrink, and no fuel has yet been found, which\r\nwill burn without any air, so that sufficient ventilation is kept up, to\r\nprevent such deadly occurrences. Still they are tolerably successful in\r\nkeeping out the unfriendly element; and by the use of huge\r\ncooking-stoves with towering ovens, and other salamander contrivances,\r\nthe little air that can find its way in, is almost as thoroughly cooked,\r\nas are the various delicacies destined for the table.\r\n\r\nOn reading an account of a run-away slave, who was for a considerable\r\ntime, closely boxed up, a gentleman remarked that if the poor fellow had\r\nonly known that a renewal of the air was necessary to the support of\r\nlife, he could not have lived there an hour without suffocation: I have\r\nfrequently thought that if the occupants of the rooms I have been\r\ndescribing, could only know as much, they would be in almost similar\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nBad air, one would think, is bad enough: but when it is heated and dried\r\nto an excessive degree, all its original vileness is stimulated to\r\ngreater activity, and thus made doubly injurious by this new element of\r\nevil. Not only our private houses, but our churches and school-rooms,\r\nour railroad cars, and all our places of public assemblage, are, to a\r\nmost lamentable degree, either unprovided with any means of ventilation,\r\nor, to a great extent, supplied with those which are so wretchedly\r\ndeficient that they\r\n\r\n    \"Keep the word of promise to our ear,\r\n    And break it to our hope.\"\r\n\r\nThat ultimate degeneracy must surely follow such entire disregard of the\r\nlaws of health, cannot be doubted; and those who imagine that the\r\nphysical stamina of a people can be undermined, and yet that their\r\nintellectual, moral and religious health will suffer no eclipse or\r\ndecay, know very little of the intimate connection between body and\r\nmind, which the Creator has seen fit to establish.\r\n\r\nThe men may, to a certain extent, resist the injurious influences of\r\nfoul air; as their employments usually compel them to live much more out\r\nof doors: but alas, alas! for the poor women! In the very land where\r\nwomen are treated with more universal deference and respect than in any\r\nother, and where they so well deserve it, there often, no provision is\r\nmade to furnish them with that great element of health, cheerfulness and\r\nbeauty, heaven's pure, fresh air.\r\n\r\nIn Southern climes, where doors and windows may be safely kept open for\r\na large part of the year, pure air is cheap enough, and can be obtained\r\nwithout any special effort: but in Northern latitudes, where heated air\r\nmust be used for nearly three-quarters of the year, the neglect of\r\nventilation is fast causing the health and beauty of our women to\r\ndisappear. The pallid cheek, or the hectic flush, the angular form and\r\ndistorted spine, the debilitated appearance of a large portion of our\r\nfemales, which to a stranger, would seem to indicate that they were just\r\nrecovering from a long illness, all these indications of the lamentable\r\nabsence of physical health, to say nothing of the anxious, care-worn\r\nfaces and premature wrinkles, proclaim in sorrowful voices, our\r\nviolation of God's physical laws, and the dreadful penalty with which He\r\nvisits our transgressions.\r\n\r\nOur people must, and I have no doubt that eventually they will be most\r\nthoroughly aroused to the necessity of a vital reform on this important\r\nsubject. Open stoves, and cheerful grates and fire-places will again be\r\nin vogue with the mass of the people, unless some better mode of warming\r\nshall be devised, which, at less expense, shall make still more ample\r\nprovision for the constant introduction of fresh air. Houses will be\r\nconstructed, which, although more expensive in the first cost, will be\r\nfar cheaper in the end, and by requiring a much smaller quantity of fuel\r\nto warm the air, will enable us to enjoy the luxury of breathing air\r\nwhich may be duly tempered, and yet be pure and invigorating. Air-tight\r\nand all other _lung-tight_ stoves will be exploded, as economizing in\r\nfuel only when they allow the smallest possible change of air, and thus\r\nsquandering health and endangering life.\r\n\r\nThe laws very wisely forbid the erection of wooden buildings in large\r\ncities, and in various ways, prescribe such regulations for the\r\nconstruction of edifices as are deemed to be essential to the public\r\nwelfare; and the time cannot, I trust, be very far distant, when all\r\npublic buildings erected for the accommodation of large numbers, will be\r\nrequired by law, to furnish a supply of fresh air, in some reasonable\r\ndegree adequate to the necessities of those who are to occupy them.\r\n\r\nI shall ask no excuse for the honest warmth of language which will\r\nappear extravagant only to those who cannot, or rather will not, see the\r\nimmense importance of pure air to the highest enjoyment, not only of\r\nphysical, but of mental and moral health. The man who shall succeed in\r\nconvincing the mass of the people, of the truth of the views thus\r\nimperfectly presented, and whose inventive mind shall devise a cheap and\r\nefficacious way of furnishing a copious supply of pure air for our\r\ndwellings and public buildings, our steamboats and railroad cars, will\r\nbe even more of a benefactor than a Jenner, or a Watt, a Fulton, or a\r\nMorse.\r\n\r\nTo return from this lengthy and yet I trust not unprofitable digression.\r\n\r\nIn the ventilation of my hive, I have endeavored, as far as possible, to\r\nmeet all the necessities of the bees, under the varying circumstances to\r\nwhich they are exposed, in our uncertain climate, whose severe extremes\r\nof temperature impress most forcibly upon the bee-keeper, the maxim of\r\nthe Mantuan Bard,\r\n\r\n    \"Utraque vis pariter apibus metuenda.\"\r\n\r\n\"Extremes of heat or cold, alike are hurtful to the bees.\" In order to\r\nmake artificial ventilation of any use to the great majority of\r\nbee-keepers, it must be simple, and not as in Nutt's hive, and many\r\nother labored contrivances, so complicated as to require almost as\r\nconstant supervision as a hot-bed or a green-house. The very foundation\r\nof any system of ventilation should be such a construction of the hive\r\nthat the bees shall need a change of air only for breathing.\r\n\r\nIn the Chapter on Protection, I have explained the construction of my\r\nhives, and of the Protector by which the bees being kept warm in Winter,\r\nand cool in Summer, do not require, as in thin hives, a very free\r\nintroduction of air, in hot weather, to keep the combs from softening;\r\nor a still larger supply in Winter, to prevent them from moulding, and\r\nto dry up the moisture which runs from their icy tops and sides; and\r\nwhich, if suffered to remain, will often affect the bees with dysentery,\r\nor as it is sometimes called, \"the rot.\" The intelligent Apiarian will\r\nperceive that I thus imitate the natural habitation of the bees in the\r\nrecesses of a hollow tree in the forest, where they feel neither the\r\nextremes of heat nor cold, and where through the efficacy of their\r\nventilating powers, a very small opening admits all the air which is\r\nnecessary for respiration.\r\n\r\nIn the Chapter on the Requisites of a good hive, I have spoken of the\r\nimportance of furnishing ventilation, independently of the entrance. By\r\nsuch an arrangement, I am able to improve upon the method which the bees\r\nare compelled to adopt in a state of nature. As they have no means of\r\nadmitting air by wire-cloth, and at the same time, of effectually\r\nexcluding all intruders, they are obliged in very hot weather, and in a\r\nvery crowded state of their dwellings, to employ a larger force in the\r\nlaborious business of ventilation, than would otherwise be necessary;\r\nwhile in Winter, they have no means of admitting air which is only\r\nmoderately cool. I can keep the entrance so small, that only a single\r\nbee can go in at once, or I can, if circumstances require, entirely\r\nclose it, and yet the bees need not suffer for the want of air. In all\r\nordinary cases, the ventilators will admit a sufficient supply of duly\r\ntempered air from the Protector, and the bees can, at any time, increase\r\ntheir efficiency by their own direct agency, while yet they will, at no\r\ntime, admit a strong current of chilly air, so as to endanger the life\r\nof the brood. As bees are, at all times, prone to close the ventilators\r\nwith propolis, they must be placed where they can easily be removed, and\r\ncleansed, by soaking them in boiling water.\r\n\r\nAs respects ventilation from above, as well as from below, so as to\r\nallow a free current of air to pass through the hive, I am decidedly\r\nopposed to it, as in cool and windy weather, such a current often\r\ncompels the bees to retire from the brood, which in this way is\r\ndestroyed by a fatal chill. In thin hives, ventilation from above may be\r\ndesirable in Winter, to carry off the superfluous moisture, but in\r\nproperly constructed hives, standing over a Protector, there is, as has\r\nalready been remarked, little or no dampness to be carried off. The\r\nconstruction of my hives will allow, if at all desirable, of ventilation\r\nfrom above; and I always make use of it, when the bees are to be shut up\r\nfor any length of time, in order to be moved; as in this case, there is\r\nalways a risk that the ventilators on the bottom-board may be clogged by\r\ndead bees, and the colony suffocated. As the entrance of the hive, may\r\nin a moment, be enlarged to any desirable extent, without in the least\r\nperplexing the bees, any quantity of air may be admitted, which the\r\nnecessities of the bees, under any possible circumstances, may require.\r\nIt may be made full 18 inches in length, but as a general rule, in\r\nSummer, in a large colony, it need not exceed six inches: while in\r\nSpring and Fall, two or three inches will suffice. In Winter, it should\r\nbe entirely closed; unless in latitudes so warm, that even with the\r\nProtector, the bees cannot be kept quiet. The bee-keeper should never\r\nforget that it is almost certain destruction to a colony, to confine\r\nthem when they wish to fly out. The precautions requisite to prevent\r\nrobbing, will be subsequently described. In Northern latitudes, in the\r\nmonths of April and May, I prefer to keep the ventilators entirely\r\nclosed; as the air of the Protector, at such times, like the air of a\r\ncellar in Spring, is uncomfortably cool, and has a tendency to interfere\r\nwith breeding.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--Since the remarks on the neglect of ventilation were put in\r\n    type, my attention has been called by Hon. M. P. Wilder, of\r\n    Dorchester, to an article on the same subject, in the Nov. number of\r\n    the Horticulturist, for 1850, from the pen of the lamented Downing.\r\n    It seems to have been written shortly after his return from Europe,\r\n    and when he must have been most deeply impressed by the woful\r\n    contrast, in point of physical health between the women of America\r\n    and Europe. While he speaks in just and therefore glowing terms of\r\n    the virtues of our countrywomen, he says: \"But in the _signs of\r\n    physical health_ and all that constitutes the outward aspect of the\r\n    men and women of the United States, our countrymen and especially\r\n    countrywomen, compare most unfavorably with all but the absolutely\r\n    starving classes on the other side of the Atlantic.\" Close stoves he\r\n    has most appropriately styled \"little demons,\" and impure air \"The\r\n    favorite poison of America.\" His article concludes as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"Pale countrymen and countrywomen rouse yourselves! Consider that\r\n    God has given us an atmosphere of pure health-giving air 45 miles\r\n    high, and _ventilate your houses_.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[15] The beautiful open or Franklin stoves, manufactured by Messrs.\r\nJagger, Treadwell and Perry, of Albany, deserve the highest\r\ncommendation: they economize fuel as well as life and health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nNATURAL SWARMING, AND HIVING OF SWARMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe swarming of bees has been justly regarded as one of the most\r\nbeautiful sights in the whole compass of rural economy. Although, for\r\nreasons which will hereafter be assigned, I prefer to rely chiefly on\r\nartificial means for the multiplication of colonies, I should be very\r\nunwilling to pass a season without participating, to some extent, in the\r\npleasing excitement of natural swarming.\r\n\r\n    \"Up mounts the chief, and to the cheated eye\r\n    Ten thousand shuttles dart along the sky;\r\n    As swift through æther rise the rushing swarms,\r\n    Gay dancing to the beam their sun-bright forms;\r\n    And each thin form, still ling'ring on the sight,\r\n    Trails, as it shoots, a line of silver light.\r\n    High pois'd on buoyant wing, the thoughtful queen,\r\n    In gaze attentive, views the varied scene,\r\n    And soon her far-fetch'd ken discerns below\r\n    The light laburnum lift her polish'd brow,\r\n    Wave her green leafy ringlets o'er the glade,\r\n    And seem to beckon to her friendly shade.\r\n    Swift as the falcon's sweep, the monarch bends\r\n    Her flight abrupt; the following host descends.\r\n    Round the fine twig, like cluster'd grapes, they close\r\n    In thickening wreaths, and court a short repose.\"\r\n                                             _Evans._\r\n\r\nThe swarming of bees, by making provision for the constant\r\nmultiplication of colonies, was undoubtedly intended both to guard the\r\ninsect against the possibility of extinction, and to make its labors in\r\nthe highest degree useful to man. The laws of reproduction in those\r\ninsects which do not live in regular colonies, are such as to secure an\r\nample increase of numbers. The same is true in the case of hornets,\r\nwasps and humble-bees which live in colonies only during the warm\r\nweather. In the Fall of the year, all the males perish, while the\r\nimpregnated females retreat into winter quarters and remain dormant,\r\nuntil the warm weather restores them to activity, and each one becomes\r\nthe mother of a new family.\r\n\r\nThe honey bee differs from all these insects, in being compelled, by the\r\nlaws of its physical organization, to live in communities, during the\r\nentire year. The balmy breezes of Spring will quickly thaw out the\r\nfrozen veins of a torpid Wasp; but the bee is incapable of enduring even\r\na moderate degree of cold: a temperature as low as 50° speedily chills\r\nit, and it would be quite as easy to recall to life the stiffened\r\ncorpses in the charnel house of the Convent of the Great St. Bernard, as\r\nto restore to animation, a frozen bee. In cool weather, they must\r\ntherefore associate in large numbers, in order to maintain the animal\r\nheat which is necessary to their preservation; and the formation of new\r\ncolonies, after the manner of wasps and hornets, is clearly impossible.\r\nIf the young queens left the parent stock in Summer, and were able, like\r\nthe mother-wasps, to lay the foundations of a new colony, they could not\r\nmaintain the warmth requisite for the development of their young, even\r\nif they were able, without any baskets on their thighs, to gather\r\nbee-bread for their support. If all these difficulties were surmounted,\r\nthey would still be unable to amass any treasures for our use, or even\r\nto lay up the stores requisite for their own preservation.\r\n\r\nHow admirably are all these difficulties obviated by the present\r\narrangement! Their domicile is well supplied with all the materials for\r\nthe rearing of brood, and long before any of the insects which depend\r\nupon the heat of the sun, are able to commence breeding, the bees have\r\nadded thousands in the full vigor of youth to their already numerous\r\npopulation. They are thus able to send off in season, colonies\r\nsufficiently powerful to take advantage of the honey-harvest, and\r\nprovision the new hive against the approach of Winter. From these\r\nconsiderations, it is very evident that swarming, so far from being, as\r\nsome Apiarians have considered it, a forced or unnatural event, is one,\r\nwhich in a state of nature, could not possibly be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nLet us now inquire under what circumstances it ordinarily takes place.\r\n\r\nThe time when swarms may be expected, depends of course, upon climate,\r\nseason, and the strength of the stocks. In the Northern and Middle\r\nStates, bees seldom swarm before the latter part of May; and June may be\r\nconsidered as the great swarming month. The importance of having\r\npowerful swarms early in the season, will be discussed in another place.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring, as soon as a hive well filled with comb and bees, becomes\r\ntoo much crowded to accommodate its teeming population, the bees begin\r\nthe necessary preparations for emigration. A number of royal cells are\r\ncommenced about the time that the drones first make their appearance;\r\nand by the time that the young queens arrive at maturity, the drones are\r\nalways found in the greatest abundance. The first swarm is invariably\r\nled off by the old queen, unless she has previously died from accident\r\nor disease, in which case, it is accompanied by one of the young queens\r\nreared to supply her loss. The old mother leaves soon after the royal\r\ncells are sealed over, unless delayed by unfavorable weather. There are\r\nno signs from which the Apiarian can, with certainty, predict the issue\r\nof a first swarm. I devoted annually, much attention to this point,\r\nvainly hoping to discover some infallible indications of first swarming;\r\nuntil taught by further reflection that, from the very nature of the\r\ncase, there can be no such indications. The bees, from an unfavorable\r\nstate of the weather, or the failure of the blossoms to yield an\r\nabundant supply of honey, often change their minds, and refuse to swarm,\r\neven after all their preparations have been completed. Nay more, they\r\nsometimes send out no new colonies that season, when a sudden change of\r\nweather has interrupted them on the very day when they were intending to\r\nemigrate, and after they had taken a full supply of honey for their\r\njourney.\r\n\r\nIf on a fair, warm day in the swarming season, but few bees leave a\r\nstrong hive, while other colonies are busily at work, we may, unless the\r\nweather suddenly prove unfavorable, look with great confidence for a\r\nswarm. As the old queens, which accompany the first swarm, are heavy\r\nwith eggs, and fly with considerable difficulty, they are shy of\r\nventuring out, except on fair, still days. If the weather is very\r\nsultry, a swarm will sometimes issue as early as 7 o'clock in the\r\nmorning; but from 10 to 2, is the usual time, and the majority of swarms\r\ncome off from 11 to 1. Occasionally, a swarm will venture out as late as\r\n5 P. M. An old queen is seldom guilty of such a piece of indiscretion.\r\n\r\nI have in repeated instances witnessed the whole process of swarming, in\r\nmy observing hives. On the day fixed for their departure, the queen\r\nappears to be very restless, and instead of depositing her eggs in the\r\ncells, she travels over the combs, and communicates her agitation to the\r\nwhole colony. The emigrating bees fill themselves with honey, some time\r\nbefore their departure: in one instance, I noticed them laying in their\r\nsupplies, more than two hours before they left. A short time before the\r\nswarm rises, a few bees may generally be seen, sporting in the air, with\r\ntheir heads turned always to the hive, occasionally flying in and out,\r\nas though they were impatient for the important event to take place. At\r\nlength, a very violent agitation commences in the hive: the bees appear\r\nalmost frantic, whirling around in a circle, which continually enlarges,\r\nlike the circles made by a stone thrown into still water, until at last\r\nthe whole hive is in a state of the greatest ferment, and the bees rush\r\nimpetuously to the entrance, and pour forth in one steady stream. Not a\r\nbee looks behind, but each one pushes straight ahead, as though flying\r\n\"for dear life,\" or urged on by some invisible power, in its headlong\r\ncareer. The queen often does not come out, until a large number have\r\nleft, and she is frequently so heavy, from the large number of eggs in\r\nher ovaries, that she falls to the ground, incapable of rising with the\r\ncolony into the air.\r\n\r\nThe bees are very soon aware of her absence, and a most interesting\r\nscene may now be witnessed. A diligent search is immediately made for\r\ntheir missing mother; the swarm scatters in all directions, and I have\r\nfrequently seen the leaves of the adjoining trees and bushes, almost as\r\nthickly covered with the anxious explorers, as they are with drops of\r\nrain after a copious shower. If she cannot be found, they return to the\r\nold hive, though occasionally they attempt to enter some other hive, or\r\njoin themselves to another swarm if any is still unhived.\r\n\r\nThe ringing of bells, and beating of kettles and frying-pans, is one of\r\nthe good old ways more honored by the breach than the observance; it may\r\nanswer a very good purpose in amusing the children, but I believe that\r\nas far as the bees are concerned, it is all time thrown away; and that\r\nit is not a whit more efficacious than the custom practiced by some\r\nsavage tribes, who, when the sun is eclipsed, imagining that it has been\r\nswallowed by an enormous dragon, resort to the most frightful noises, to\r\ncompel his snake-ship to disgorge their favorite luminary. If a swarm\r\nhas selected a new home previous to their departure, no amount of\r\n_noise_ will ever compel them to alight, but as soon as all the bees\r\nwhich compose the emigrating colony have left the hive, they fly in a\r\ndirect course, or \"bee-line,\" to the chosen spot. I have noticed that\r\nwhen bees are much neglected by those who pretend to take care of them,\r\nsuch unceremonious leave-taking is quite common; on the contrary, when\r\nproper attention is bestowed on them, it seldom occurs.\r\n\r\nIt can seldom if ever occur to those who manage their bees according to\r\nmy system; as I shall show in the Chapter on Artificial Swarming. If the\r\nApiarian perceives that his swarm instead of clustering begins to rise\r\nhigher and higher in the air, and evidently means to depart, not a\r\nmoment is to be lost: instead of empty noises, he must resort to means\r\nmuch more effective to stay their vagrant propensities. Handfulls of\r\ndirt cast into the air, or water thrown among them, will often so\r\ndisorganize them as to compel them to alight. Of all devices for\r\nstopping them, the most original one that I have ever heard of, is to\r\nflash the sun's rays among them, by the use of a looking glass! I have\r\nnever had occasion to try it, but the anonymous writer who recommends\r\nit, says that he never knew it to fail. If they are forcibly prevented\r\nfrom eloping, then special care must be taken or they will be almost\r\nsure soon after hiving, to leave for their selected home. The queen\r\nshould be caught and confined for several days in a way which will be\r\nsubsequently described. The same caution must be exercised, when new\r\nswarms abandon their hive. If the queen cannot be caught, and there is\r\nreason to dread a desertion, the bees may be carried into the cellar,\r\nand confined in total darkness, until towards sun-set of the third day\r\nafter they swarmed, being supplied in the mean time with water and honey\r\nto build their combs.\r\n\r\nIf a colony decides to go, they look upon the hive in which they are put\r\nas only a temporary stopping place, and seldom trouble themselves to\r\nbuild any comb in it. If the hive is so constructed as to permit\r\ninspection, I can tell by a glance whether bees are disgusted with their\r\nnew residence, and mean before long to clear out. They not only refuse\r\nto work with that energy so characteristic of a new swarm, but they have\r\na peculiar look which to the experienced eye at once proclaims the fact\r\nthat they are staying only upon sufferance. Their very attitude, hanging\r\nas they do with a sort of dogged or supercilious air, as though they\r\nhated even so much as to touch their detested abode, is equivalent to an\r\nopen proclamation that they mean to be off. My numerous experiments in\r\nattempting from the moment of hiving, to make the bees work in observing\r\nhives exposed to the full light of day, instead of keeping them as I now\r\ndo in darkness for several days, have made me quite familiar with all\r\ntheir graceless, do-nothing proceedings before their departure. Bees\r\nsometimes abandon their hives very early in the Spring, or late in\r\nSummer or Fall. They exhibit all the appearance of natural swarming; but\r\nthey leave, not because the population is crowded, but because it is\r\neither so small, or the hive so destitute of supplies, that they are\r\ndiscouraged or driven to desperation. I once knew a colony to leave the\r\nhive under such circumstances, on a springlike day in December! They\r\nseem to have a presentiment that they must perish if they stay, and\r\ninstead of awaiting the sure approach of famine, they sally\r\nout to see if something cannot be done to better their condition.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, it seems strange that so provident an insect should not\r\nalways select a suitable domicile before venturing on so important a\r\nstep as to abandon the old home. Often before they are safely housed\r\nagain, they are exposed to powerful winds and drenching rains, which\r\nbeat down and destroy many of their number.\r\n\r\nI solve this problem in the economy of the bee, in the same manner that\r\nI have solved so many others, by considering in what way, this\r\narrangement conduces to the advantage of man.\r\n\r\nThe honey-bee would have been of comparatively little service to him, if\r\ninstead of tarrying until he had sufficient time to establish them in a\r\nhive in which to labor for him, their instinct impelled them to decamp,\r\nwithout any delay, from the restraints of domestication. In this, as in\r\nmany other things, we see that what on a superficial view, appeared to\r\nbe a very obvious imperfection, proves, on closer examination, to be a\r\nspecial contrivance to answer important ends.\r\n\r\nTo return to our new swarm. The queen sometimes alights first, and\r\nsometimes joins the cluster after it has commenced forming. It is a very\r\nrare thing for the bees ever to cluster, unless the queen is with them;\r\nand when they do, and yet afterwards disperse, I believe that usually\r\nthe queen, after first rising with them, has been lost by falling into\r\nsome spot where she is unnoticed by the bees. In two instances, I\r\nperformed the following interesting experiment.\r\n\r\nPerceiving a hive in the very act of swarming, I contracted the entrance\r\nso as to secure the queen when she made her appearance. In each case, at\r\nleast one third of the bees came out, before the queen presented\r\nherself to join them. When I perceived that the swarm had given up their\r\nsearch for her, and were beginning to return to the parent hive, I\r\nplaced her, with her wings clipped, on the limb of a small evergreen\r\ntree: she crawled to the very top of the limb, as if for the purpose of\r\nmaking herself as conspicuous as possible. A few bees noticed her, and\r\ninstead of alighting, darted rapidly away; in a few seconds, the whole\r\ncolony were apprised of her presence, flew in a dense cloud to the spot,\r\nand commenced quietly clustering around her. I have often noticed the\r\nsurprising rapidity with which bees communicate with each other, while\r\non the wing. Telegraphic signals are hardly more instantaneous. (See\r\nChapter on the Loss of the Queen.)\r\n\r\nThat bees send out scouts to seek a suitable abode, it seems to me, can\r\nadmit of no serious question. Swarms have been traced to their new home,\r\neither in their flight directly from their hive, or from the place where\r\nthey have clustered; and it is evident, that in such instances, they\r\nhave pursued the most direct course. Now such a precision of flight to a\r\n\"_terra incognita_,\" an unknown home, would plainly be impossible, if\r\nsome of their number had not previously selected the spot, so as to be\r\ncompetent to act as guides to the rest. The sight of the bees for\r\ndistant objects, is wonderfully acute, and after rising to a sufficient\r\nelevation, they can see the prominent objects in the vicinity of their\r\nintended abode, even although they may be several miles distant. Whether\r\nthe bees send out their scouts _before_ or _after_ swarming, may admit\r\nof more question. In cases where the colony flies without alighting, to\r\nits new home, they are unquestionably dispatched before swarming. If\r\nthis were their usual course, then we should naturally expect all the\r\ncolonies to take the same speedy departure. Or if, for the convenience\r\nof the queen over fatigued by the excitement of swarming, or for any\r\nother reason, they should see fit to cluster, then we should expect that\r\nonly a transient tarrying would be allowed. Instead of this, they often\r\nremain until the next day, and instances of a more protracted delay are\r\nnot unfrequent. The cases which occur, of bees stopping in their flight,\r\nand clustering again on any convenient object, are not inconsistent with\r\nthis view of the subject; for if the weather is hot, and the sun shines\r\ndirectly upon them, they will often leave before they have found a\r\nsuitable habitation; and even when they are on the way to their new\r\nhome, the queen being heavy with eggs, and unaccustomed to fly, is\r\nsometimes from weariness, compelled to alight, and her colony clusters\r\naround her. Queens, under such circumstances, sometimes seem unwilling\r\nto entrust themselves again to their wings, and the poor bees attempt to\r\nlay the foundations of their colony, on fence rails, hay-stacks, or\r\nother most unsuitable places.\r\n\r\nI have been informed by Mr. Henry M. Zollickoffer of Philadelphia, a\r\nvery intelligent and reliable observer, that he knew a swarm to settle\r\non a willow tree in that city, in a lot owned by the Pennsylvania\r\nHospital; it remained there for sometime, and the boys pelted it with\r\nstones, to get possession of its comb and honey.\r\n\r\nThe absolute necessity for scouts or explorers, is evident from all the\r\nfacts in the case, unless we admit that bees have the faculty of flying\r\nin an air-line to a hollow tree, or some suitable abode which they have\r\nnever seen, though they cannot find their hive, if, in their absence, it\r\nis moved only a few rods from its former position.\r\n\r\nThese obvious considerations are abundantly confirmed by the repeated\r\ninstances in which a few bees have been noticed prying very\r\ninquisitively into a hole in a hollow tree or the cornice of a\r\nbuilding, and have been succeeded, before long, by a whole colony. The\r\nimportance of these remarks will be more obvious, when I come to discuss\r\nthe proper mode of hiving bees.\r\n\r\nHaving described the common method of procedure pursued by the new\r\nswarm, when left without interference to their natural instincts, it is\r\ntime to return to the parent stock from which they emigrated.\r\n\r\nIn witnessing the immense number which have abandoned it, we might\r\nnaturally suppose that it must be almost entirely depopulated. It is\r\nsometimes asserted that as bees swarm in the pleasantest part of the\r\nday, the population is replenished by the return of large numbers of\r\nworkers that were absent in the fields; this, however, can seldom be the\r\ncase, as it is rare for many bees to be absent from the hive at the time\r\nof swarming.\r\n\r\nTo those who limit the fertility of the queen to 200, or at most 400\r\neggs per day, the rapid replenishing of the hive after swarming, must\r\never be a problem incapable of solution; but to those who have ocular\r\ndemonstration that she can lay from one to three thousand eggs a day, it\r\nis no mystery at all. A sufficient number of bees is always left behind,\r\nto carry on the domestic operations of the hive, and as the old queen\r\ndeparts only when the population of the hive is super-abundant; and when\r\nthousands of young bees are hatching daily, and often 30,000 or more,\r\nare rapidly maturing, in a short time the hive is almost as populous as\r\nit was before swarming. Those who assert that the new colony is composed\r\nof young bees which have been forced to emigrate by the older ones, have\r\ncertainly failed to use their eyes to much advantage, or they would have\r\nseen, in hiving a new swarm, that it is composed of both young and old;\r\nsome, having wings ragged from hard work, while others are evidently\r\nquite young. After the tumult of swarming is entirely over, not a bee\r\nthat did not participate in it, seeks afterwards to join the new colony,\r\nand not one that did, seeks to return. What determines some to go, and\r\nothers to stay, we have no certain means of knowing.\r\n\r\nHow wonderfully abiding the impression made upon an insect, which in a\r\nmoment causes it to lose all its strong affection for the old home in\r\nwhich it was bred, and which it has entered, perhaps hundreds of times;\r\nso that when established in another hive, though only a few feet\r\ndistant, it never afterwards pays the slightest attention to its former\r\nabode! Often, when the hive into which the new swarm is put, is not\r\nremoved from the place where the bees were hived, until some have gone\r\nto the fields, on their return, they fly for hours, in ceaseless circles\r\nabout the spot where the missing hive stood. I have often known them to\r\ncontinue the vain search for their companions until they have, at\r\nlength, dropped down from utter exhaustion, and perished in close\r\nproximity to their old homes!\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated that the old queen, if the weather is\r\nfavorable, generally leaves about the time that the young queens are\r\nsealed over, to be changed into nymphs. In about eight days more, one of\r\nthese queens hatches, and the question must now be decided whether any\r\nmore colonies are to be sent out that season, or not. If the hive is\r\nwell filled with bees, and the season in all respects promising, this\r\nquestion is generally decided in the affirmative; although colonies\r\noften refuse to swarm more than once when they are very strong, and when\r\nwe can assign no reason for such a course; and they sometimes swarm\r\nrepeatedly, to the utter ruin of both the old stock, and the\r\nafter-swarms.\r\n\r\nIf the bees decide to swarm again, the first hatched queen is allowed\r\nto have her own way. She rushes immediately to the cells of her sisters,\r\nand, (as was described in the Chapter on Physiology,) stings them to\r\ndeath. From some observations that I have made, I am inclined to think\r\nthat the other bees aid her in this murderous transaction: they\r\ncertainly tear open the cradles of the slaughtered innocents, and remove\r\nthem from the cells. Their dead bodies may often be found on the ground\r\nin front of the hive.\r\n\r\nWhen a queen has emerged in the natural way from her cell, the bees\r\nusually nibble away the now useless abode, until only a small acorn cup\r\nremains; but when by violence she has met with an untimely end, they\r\ntake down entirely the whole of the cell. By counting these acorn-cups,\r\nit can always be ascertained how many young queens have hatched in a\r\nhive.\r\n\r\nBefore the queens emerge from their cells, a fluttering sound is\r\nfrequently heard, which is caused by the rapid motion of their wings,\r\nand which must not be confounded with the piping notes which will soon\r\nbe described. If the bees of the parent stock decide to swarm again, the\r\nfirst hatched queen is prevented from killing the others. A strong guard\r\nis kept over their cells, and as often as she approaches them with\r\nmurderous intent, she is bitten, or otherwise rudely treated, and given\r\nto understand by the most uncourtier-like demonstrations, that she\r\ncannot, in all things, do just as she pleases.\r\n\r\nWhen thus repulsed, like men and women who cannot have their own way,\r\nshe is highly offended and utters an angry sound, given forth in a quick\r\nsuccession of notes, and which sounds not unlike the rapid utterance of\r\nthe words, \"peep, peep.\" I have frequently, by holding a queen in the\r\nclosed hand, caused her to make the same noise. To this angry note, one\r\nor more of the queens still unhatched, will respond, in a somewhat\r\nhoarser key, just as chicken-cocks, by crowing, bid defiance to each\r\nother. These sounds are entirely unlike the usual steady hum of the\r\nbees, and when heard, are the almost infallible indications that a\r\nsecond swarm will soon issue. They are occasionally so loud that they\r\nmay be heard at some distance from the hive.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after first swarming, the Apiarian should, early in the\r\nmorning or at evening, when the bees are still, place his ear against\r\nthe hive, and he will, if the queens are piping, readily recognize their\r\npeculiar sounds. If their notes are not heard, at the very latest,\r\nsixteen days after the departure of the first swarm, by which time the\r\nyoung queens are mature, even if the first colony left as soon as the\r\neggs were deposited in the royal cells, it is an infallible indication\r\nthat the first hatched queen is without rivals in the hive, and that\r\nswarming is over, in that stock, for the season.\r\n\r\nThe second swarm usually issues on the second or third day after this\r\nsound is heard: although I have known them to delay coming out, until\r\nthe fifth day, in consequence of a very unfavorable state of the\r\nweather. Occasionally, the weather is so unfavorable, that the bees\r\npermit the oldest queen to kill the others, and refuse to swarm again.\r\nThis is a rare occurrence, as the young queens, unlike the old ones, do\r\nnot appear to be very particular about the weather, and sometimes\r\nventure out, not merely when it is cloudy, but even when rain is\r\nfalling. On this account, if a very close watch is not kept, they are\r\noften lost. As piping ordinarily commences about eight or nine days\r\nafter first swarming, the second swarm generally issues ten or twelve\r\ndays after the first. It has been known to issue as early as the third\r\nday after the first, and as late as the seventeenth. Such cases,\r\nhowever, are of rare occurrence. It frequently happens in the agitation\r\nof swarming, that several of the young queens emerge from their cells at\r\nthe same time, and accompany the colony: when this is the case, the bees\r\noften alight in two or more separate clusters. Young queens not having\r\ntheir ovaries burdened with eggs, are much more quick on the wing, than\r\nold ones, and fly frequently much farther from the parent stock, before\r\nthey alight; though I never knew a second swarm to depart to the woods\r\nwithout clustering at all. After the departure of a second swarm, the\r\noldest of the remaining queens leaves her cell; and if another swarm is\r\nto be sent forth, piping will still be heard, and so before the issue of\r\neach swarm after the first. I once had five stocks issue from one swarm,\r\nand they all came out in about two weeks. In warm latitudes more than\r\ntwice this number of swarms have been known to issue in one season from\r\na single stock. The third swarm commonly makes its appearance on the\r\nsecond or third day after the second swarm, and the others, at intervals\r\nof about a day.\r\n\r\nAfter-swarms, or casts, (these names are given to all swarms after the\r\nfirst,) reduce very seriously the strength of the parent stock; for\r\nafter the departure of the old queen, no more eggs are deposited in the\r\ncells, until all swarming is over. It is a very wise arrangement that\r\nthe second swarm does not ordinarily issue until all the eggs left by\r\nthe first queen are hatched, and the young fed and sealed over, so as to\r\nrequire no further care. The departure of the second swarm earlier than\r\nthis, would leave too few laborers to attend to the wants of the young\r\nbees. As it is, if the weather after swarming, suddenly becomes chilly,\r\nand the hives are thin and admit too much air, the bees are too much\r\nreduced in numbers, to maintain the heat requisite for the proper\r\ndevelopment of the brood, and numbers are destroyed.\r\n\r\nIn the Chapter on Artificial Swarming, I shall discuss the effect of too\r\nfrequent swarming, on the profits of the Apiary. If the bee-keeper\r\ndesires to have no casts, he can, by the use of my hives, very easily,\r\nprevent their issue. As soon as the first swarm is hived, the parent\r\nstock may be opened, and all the queen cells except one removed. How\r\nmuch better this is, than to attempt to return the after-swarms to the\r\nparent hive, can only be appreciated by one who has thoroughly tried\r\nboth plans. If the Apiarian desires the most rapid multiplication of\r\ncolonies possible, where natural swarming is relied on, full directions\r\nwill be furnished, in the sequel, for building up all after-swarms,\r\nhowever small, into vigorous stocks. It will be remembered that both the\r\nparent stock from which the swarm issues, and all the colonies except\r\nthe first, have a young queen. These queens never leave the hive for\r\nimpregnation, until after they have been established as the acknowledged\r\nheads of independent families. They generally go out for this purpose,\r\nthe first pleasant day after they are thus acknowledged, early in the\r\nafternoon, at which hour the drones are flying in the greatest numbers.\r\nOn first leaving their hive, they always fly with their heads turned\r\ntowards it, and enter and depart often several times before they finally\r\nsoar up into the air. Such precautions on the part of a young queen, are\r\nhighly necessary that she may not mistake her own hive on her return,\r\nand lose her life by attempting to enter that of another colony.\r\nMistakes of this kind are frequently made when the hives stand near, and\r\nclosely resemble each other, and are fatal, not only to the queen, but\r\nto her whole colony. In the new hive there is no brood at all, and in\r\nthe old one it is too far advanced towards maturity to answer for\r\nraising new queens. Such calamities, in my hive, admit of a very easy\r\nremedy, as I shall show in the Chapter on the Loss of the Queen.\r\n\r\nTo guard the young queen against such frequent mistakes, I paint the\r\ncovered fronts of my hives, with the alighting boards, and blocks\r\nguarding the entrance, of different colors. This answers the same\r\npurpose as to paint the whole surface of the boxes, some of one color,\r\nand some of another. The only proper color for a hive when exposed to\r\nthe weather, is a perfect white; any shade of color will absorb the heat\r\nof the sun, so as to warp the wood-work of the hive, besides exposing\r\nthe bees to a pent and suffocating heat.\r\n\r\nWhen a young queen leaves the hive for the purpose above mentioned, the\r\nbees, on missing her, are often filled with alarm, and rush from the\r\nhive, just as though they were intending to swarm. Their agitation soon\r\ncalms down, if she returns to them in safety. I shall give through the\r\nmedium of the Latin tongue, some statements which are important only to\r\nthe scientific naturalist, and entomologist.\r\n\r\nPost coitum fucus statim perit. Penis ejectio, ut ego comperi, lenem\r\ncompressionem fuci ventris, consequitur; et fucus extemplo similis\r\nfulmine tacto, moritur. Dominus Huber sæpe videbat fuci organum post\r\ncongressum, in corpore feminæ hæsisse. Vidi semel tam firme inhærens, ut\r\nnisi disruptione reginæ ventris, non possim divellere.\r\n\r\nThe queen commences laying eggs, about two days after impregnation, and\r\nfor the first season, lays none but the eggs of workers; no males being\r\nneeded in colonies which will throw no swarm till another season. It is\r\nseldom until after she has commenced replenishing the cells with eggs,\r\nthat she is treated with any special attention by the bees; although if\r\ndeprived of her before this time, they show, by their despair, that they\r\nthoroughly comprehended her vast importance to their welfare.\r\n\r\nI shall now give such practical directions for the easy hiving of\r\nswarms, as will, I trust, greatly facilitate the whole operation, not\r\nmerely to the novice, but even to many experienced bee-keepers; and I\r\nshall try to make these directions sufficiently minute, to guide those\r\nwho having never seen a swarm hived, are very apt to imagine that the\r\nprocess must be a formidable one, instead of being, as it usually is to\r\nthose who are fond of bees, a most delightful entertainment. Experience\r\nin this, as in other things, will speedily give the requisite skill and\r\nconfidence; and the cry of \"the bees are swarming,\" will soon be hailed\r\nwith greater pleasure than an invitation to the most sumptuous banquet.\r\n\r\nThe hives for the new swarms should all be in readiness before the\r\nswarming season begins, and should be painted long enough beforehand, to\r\nhave the paint most thoroughly dried. The smell of fresh paint is well\r\nknown to be exceedingly injurious to human beings, and is such an\r\nabomination to the bees, that they will often desert a new hive sooner\r\nthan put up with it. If the hives cannot be painted in ample season,\r\nthen such paints should be used, as contain no white lead, and they\r\nshould be mixed in such a manner as to dry as quickly as possible. Thin\r\nhives ought never to stand in the sun, and then, when heated to an\r\ninsufferable degree, be used for a new swarm. Bees often refuse to enter\r\nsuch hives at all, and at best, are very slow in taking possession of\r\nthem. It should be borne in mind, that bees, when they swarm, are\r\ngreatly excited, and unnaturally heated. The temperature of the hive, at\r\nthe moment of swarming, rises very suddenly, and many of the bees are\r\noften drenched with such a profuse perspiration that they are unable to\r\ntake wing and join the departing colony. The attempt to make bees enter\r\na heated hive in a blazing sun, is as irrational as it would be to try\r\nto force a panting crowd of human beings into the suffocating atmosphere\r\nof a close garret. If bees are to be put in hives through which the\r\nheat of the sun can penetrate, the process should be accomplished in the\r\nshade, or if this cannot conveniently be done, the hive should be\r\ncovered with a sheet, or shaded with leafy boughs. If a hive with my\r\nmovable frames is used, these should all be furnished, or at least,\r\nevery other one, with a small piece of worker-comb, attached to the\r\ncenter of the frame, with melted wax or rosin. Without such a guide\r\ncomb, the bees will almost always work some of the combs out of the true\r\ndirection, and this will interfere with their easy removal. A sheet of\r\ncomb, not larger than five inches square, will answer for all the frames\r\nof one hive. If even so small a piece of comb as this cannot be\r\nprocured, let a thin line of melted wax be drawn, lengthwise, over the\r\nmiddle of each frame, and let the colony be examined, on the second day\r\nafter hiving, and all the frames which contain irregular comb, be\r\nremoved. This comb may be cut off, and attached so as to serve as a\r\nproper guide to the bees. The possession of six frames containing good\r\nworker comb, and wrought with perfect accuracy, may be made by the\r\nfollowing device, to answer a most admirable end. Put them into a hive\r\nwith six empty frames; first a frame with comb, then an empty one, &c.\r\nAfter the bees have had possession of this hive two or three days, visit\r\nthem, and very politely inform them that the full frames were intended\r\nas a loan, and not as a gift; and that having served to set them an\r\nexample how they should work, you must now have them to teach other\r\nyoung swarms the same useful lesson; and that the new combs which they\r\nhave built with such admirable regularity, are beautiful patterns for\r\nthe empty ones which you must give them. In this way, the same combs may\r\nbe made to answer for many successive swarms.\r\n\r\nDrone combs should never be attached to the frames as a guide, unless it\r\nis desired to have the bees follow the pattern, and build large ranges\r\nof drone comb, to breed a vast horde of useless consumers. Such comb, if\r\nwhite, may be used to great advantage in the surplus honey-boxes; if old\r\nand discolored, it should be melted for wax. I am now engaged in a\r\ncourse of experiments, which I hope, will enable me to dispense with the\r\nnecessity of guide-combs for my frames, as they are sometimes difficult\r\nto be procured by those who have just commenced bee-keeping. As a\r\ngeneral thing, however, every one, after a few weeks' experience, may\r\nhave enough and to spare, for such purposes. Every piece of good\r\nworker-comb, if large enough to be attached to a frame, should be used\r\nboth for its intrinsic value, and because bees are so wonderfully\r\npleased when they find such unexpected treasures in a hive, that they\r\nwill seldom desert it. A new swarm has been known to take possession of\r\nan old hive without any occupants, but well stored with comb. Though\r\ndozens of empty hives may be in the Apiary, they never unless under such\r\ncircumstances, enter a hive, of their own accord. It might seem as\r\nthough an instinct impelling them to do so, would have been a most\r\nadmirable one, and so doubtless, it may seem to some that it would have\r\nbeen much better for man, if the earth had only brought forth\r\nspontaneously all things requisite for the support of man and beast,\r\nwithout any necessity for the sweat of the brow. The first and last\r\nframes in my hive, are placed about a quarter of an inch from the ends,\r\nand the others just half an inch apart. When first put in, it will be\r\nadvisable to attach them slightly with a very little glue or melted wax,\r\nto keep them in their places, until they are fastened with propolis, by\r\nthe bees. The rubbing of hives with various kinds of herbs or washes,\r\nhas always seemed to me, useless, and often positively injurious. There\r\nought always to be some small trees near the hives, on which the swarms\r\ncan cluster, and from which they can be easily gathered. If there are\r\nnone, limbs of trees about six feet high, (evergreens are best,) may be\r\nfastened into the ground, a few rods in front of the hives, and they\r\nwill answer a very good temporary purpose. It will inspire the\r\ninexperienced Apiarian with much greater confidence, to remember that\r\nalmost all the bees in a swarm, have filled themselves with honey,\r\nbefore leaving the parent stock, and are therefore in a very peaceable\r\nmood. If he is at all timid, or liable, as some are, to suffer severely\r\nfrom the sting of a single bee, he should, by all means, furnish himself\r\nwith the protection of a bee-dress. (See Bee-Dress.)\r\n\r\nI shall, in another place, give the best remedies for the relief of a\r\nsting. As soon as the bees have quietly clustered around their queen,\r\npreparation should be made to hive them without any unnecessary delay.\r\nThe headlong haste of some Apiarians, which, by throwing them into a\r\nprofuse perspiration, renders them very liable to be stung, is\r\naltogether unnecessary. The very fact that the bees have clustered,\r\nafter leaving the parent stock, is almost equivalent to a certainty that\r\nthey will not leave, for at least one or two hours. All convenient\r\ndespatch should be used, however, lest other colonies issue before the\r\nfirst one is hived, and attempt to add themselves, as they frequently\r\ndo, to the first swarm. The proper course to be pursued, in such a case,\r\nwill be subsequently explained. If my hives are used, the entrance on\r\nthe whole front must be opened, so that the bees may have every chance\r\nto enter as rapidly as possible; and a sheet must be fastened to the\r\nalighting-board, to keep the bees from being separated from each other\r\nor soiled by dirt, for a bee thoroughly covered with dust or dirt, is\r\nalmost sure to perish. Unless the bees cluster at a considerable\r\ndistance from the place where they are intended to be permanently\r\nstationed, the new hive which receives them may stand on the Protector\r\nin its proper place, with the sheet tacked or pinned to the\r\nalighting-board, and spread out over the mound in front of the entrance.\r\nIf the common hives are used, they must generally be carried to the\r\nswarm, and propped up on the sheet, so as to give the bees a free\r\nadmission. When the bees alight where they can be easily reached from\r\nthe ground, the limb on which they have clustered, should, with one\r\nhand, be shaken, so that they may gently fall into a basket held under\r\nthem, by the other. If the basket is sufficiently open to admit the air\r\nfreely, and not so open as to allow the bees to get through the sides,\r\nit will answer all the better. The bees should now be carried very\r\nslowly to their new home, and be gently shaken, or poured out, on the\r\nsheet, in front of it. If they seem at all reluctant to enter, take up a\r\nfew of them in a large spoon, (a cup will answer equally well,) and\r\nshake them close to the entrance. As they go in, they will fan with\r\ntheir wings, and raise a peculiar note, which communicates the joyful\r\nnews that they have found a home, to the rest of their companions; and\r\nin a short time, the whole swarm will enter, and they are thus safely\r\nhived, without injury to a single bee. When bees are once shaken down on\r\nthe sheet, the great mass of them are very unwilling to take wing again;\r\nfor they are loaded with honey, and like heavily armed troops, they\r\ndesire to march slowly and sedately to the place of encampment. If the\r\nsheet hangs in folds, or is not stretched out, so as to present an\r\nuninterrupted surface, they are often greatly confused, and take a long\r\ntime to find the entrance to the hive. If it is desired to have them\r\nenter sooner than they are sometimes inclined to do, they may be gently\r\nseparated, with a feather, or leafy twig, when they cluster in bunches\r\non the sheet. On first shaking them down into the basket, multitudes\r\nwill again take wing, and multitudes more will be left on the tree, but\r\nthey will speedily form a line of communication with those on the sheet,\r\nand enter the hive with them; for many of them will follow the Apiarian,\r\nas he slowly carries the basket to the hive.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that the queen is left on the tree: in this case,\r\nthe bees will either refuse to enter the hive, or if they go in, will\r\nspeedily come out, and all take wing again, to join their queen. This\r\nhappens much more frequently in the case of after-swarms, whose young\r\nqueens, instead of exhibiting the gravity of the old matron, are apt to\r\nbe constantly flying about, and frisking in the air. When the bees\r\ncluster again on the tree, the process of hiving must be repeated.\r\n\r\nIf the Apiarian has a pair of sharp pruning-shears, and the limb on\r\nwhich the bees have clustered, is of no value, and so small, that it can\r\nbe cut without jarring them off, this may be done, and the bees carried\r\non it and then shaken off on the sheet.\r\n\r\nIf the bees settle too high to be easily reached, the basket should be\r\nfastened to a pole, and raised directly under the swarm; a quick motion\r\nof the basket will cause the mass of the bees to fall into it, when it\r\nmay be carried to the hive, and the bees poured out from it on the\r\nsheet.\r\n\r\nIf the bees light on the trunk of a tree, or any thing from which they\r\ncannot easily be gathered in a basket, place a leafy bough over them,\r\n(it may be fastened with a gimlet,) and if they do not mount it of their\r\nown accord, a little smoke will compel them to do so. If the place is\r\ninaccessible, and this is about the worst case that occurs, they will\r\nenter a basket well shaded by cotton cloth fastened around it, and\r\nelevated so as to rest with its open top sideways to the mass of the\r\nbees. When small trees, or limbs fastened into the ground, are placed\r\nnear the hives, and there are no large trees near, there will seldom be\r\nfound any difficulty in hiving swarms. If two swarms light together, I\r\nadvise that they should be put into one hive, and abundant room at once\r\nbe given them, for storing surplus honey. This can always be readily\r\ndone in my hives. Large quantities of honey are generally obtained from\r\nsuch stocks, if the season is favorable, and they have issued early. If\r\nit is desired to separate them, place in each of the hives which is to\r\nreceive them, a comb containing brood and eggs, from which, in case of\r\nnecessity, a new queen may be raised. Shake a portion of the bees in\r\nfront of each hive, sprinkling them thoroughly, both before and after\r\nthey are shaken out from the basket, so that they will not take wing to\r\nunite again. If possible, secure the queens, so that one may be given to\r\neach hive. If this cannot be done, the hives should be examined the next\r\nday, and if the two queens entered the same hive, one will have killed\r\nthe other, and the queenless hive will be found building royal cells. It\r\nshould be supplied with a sealed queen nearly mature, taken from another\r\nhive, not only to save time, but to prevent them from filling their hive\r\nwith comb unfit for the rearing of workers. (See Artificial Swarming.)\r\nOf course, this cannot be done with the common hives, and if the\r\nApiarian does not succeed in getting a queen for each hive, the\r\nqueenless one will refuse to stay, and will go back to the old stock.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned way of hiving bees, by mounting trees, cutting and\r\nlowering down large limbs, (often to the injury of valuable trees,) and\r\nplacing the hive over the bees, frequently crushing large numbers, and\r\nendangering the life of the queen, should be entirely abandoned. A\r\nswarm may be hived in the proper way with far less risk and trouble, and\r\nin much less time. In large Apiaries managed on the swarming plan, where\r\na number of swarms come out on the same day, and there is constant\r\ndanger of their mixing,[16] the speedy hiving of swarms is an object of\r\ngreat importance. If the new hive does not stand where it is to remain\r\nfor the season, it should be removed to its permanent stand as soon as\r\nthe bees have entered; for if allowed to remain to be removed in the\r\nevening, or early next morning, the scouts which have left the cluster,\r\nin search of a hollow tree, will find the bees when they return, and\r\nwill often entice them from the hive. There is the greater danger of\r\nthis, if the bees have remained on the tree, a considerable time before\r\nthey were hived. I have invariably found that swarms which abandon a\r\nsuitable hive for the woods, have been hived near the spot where they\r\nclustered, and allowed to remain to be moved in the evening. If the bees\r\nswarm early in the day, they will generally begin to work in a few\r\nhours (or in less time, if they have empty comb,) and many more may be\r\nlost by returning next day to the place where they were hived, than\r\nwould be lost, by removing them as soon as they have entered; in this\r\nlatter case, the few that are on the wing, will generally be able to\r\nfind the hive if it is slowly moved to its permanent stand.\r\n\r\nIf the Apiarian wishes to secure the queen, the bees should be shaken\r\nfrom the hiving basket, about a foot from the entrance to the hive, and\r\nif a careful look-out is kept, she will generally be seen as she passes\r\nover the sheet, to the entrance. Care must be taken to brush the bees\r\nback from the entrance when they press forward in such dense masses that\r\nthe queen is likely to enter unnoticed. An experienced eye readily\r\ncatches a glance of her peculiar form and color. She may be taken up\r\nwithout danger, as she never stings, unless engaged in combat with\r\nanother queen. As it will sometimes happen, even to careful bee-keepers,\r\nthat swarms will come off when no suitable hives are in readiness to\r\nreceive them, I shall show what may be done in such an emergency. Take\r\nany old hive, box, cask, or measure, and hive the bees in it, placing\r\nthem with suitable protection against the sun, where their new hive is\r\nto stand; when this is ready, they may, by a quick jerking motion, be\r\neasily shaken out on a sheet, and hived in it, just as though they were\r\nshaken from the hiving basket. If they are to remain in the temporary\r\nhive over the second day, they ought to be shaken out on a sheet, and\r\nafter their comb is taken from them, allowed to enter it again, or else\r\nthere will be danger of crushing the queen by the weight of the comb.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored, even at the risk of being tedious, to give such\r\nspecific directions as will qualify the novice to hive a swarm of bees,\r\nunder almost any circumstances; for I know the necessity of such\r\ndirections and how seldom they are to be met with, even in large\r\ntreatises on Bee-Keeping. Vague or imperfect directions always fail,\r\njust at the moment that the inexperienced attempt to put them into\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, I will add to the directions for hiving\r\nalready given, a method which I have practiced with good success.\r\n\r\nWhen the situation of the bees does not admit of the basket being easily\r\nelevated to them, the bee-keeper may carry it with him to the cluster,\r\nand then after shaking the bees into it, may lower it down by a string,\r\nto an assistant standing below.\r\n\r\nThat Natural Swarming may, with suitable hives, be made highly\r\nprofitable, I cannot for a moment question. As it is the most simple and\r\nobvious way of multiplying colonies, and the one which requires the\r\nleast amount of knowledge or skill, it will undoubtedly, for many years\r\nat least, be the favorite method with a large number of bee-keepers. I\r\nhave therefore, been careful to furnish suitable directions for its\r\nsuccessful practice; and before I discuss the question of Artificial\r\nIncrease, I shall show how it may be more profitably conducted than ever\r\nbefore; many of the most embarrassing difficulties in the way of its\r\nsuccessful management being readily obviated by the use of my hives.\r\n\r\n1. The common hives fail to furnish adequate protection in Winter,\r\nagainst cold, and those sudden changes to unseasonable warmth, by which\r\nbees are tempted to come out and perish in large numbers on the snow;\r\nand the colonies are thus prevented from breeding on a large scale, as\r\nearly as they otherwise would. Under such circumstances, they can make\r\nno profitable use of the early honey-harvest; and they will swarm so\r\nlate, if they swarm at all, as to have but little opportunity for\r\nlaying up surplus honey, while often they do not gather enough even for\r\ntheir own use, and their owner closes the season by purchasing honey to\r\npreserve them from starvation. The way in which I give the bees that\r\namount of protection in Winter, which conduces most powerfully to early\r\nswarming, has already been described in the Chapter on Protection.\r\n\r\n2. Another serious objection to all the ordinary swarming hives, is the\r\nvexatious fact that if the bees swarm at all, they are liable to swarm\r\nso often as to destroy the value of both the parent stock and the\r\nafter-swarms. Experienced bee-keepers obviate this difficulty, by\r\nuniting second swarms, so as to make one good colony out of two; and\r\nthey return to the parent stock all swarms after the second, and even\r\nthis if the season is far advanced. Such operations consume much time,\r\nand often give much more trouble than they are worth. By removing all\r\nthe queen cells but one, after the first swarm has left, second swarming\r\nin my hives will always be prevented; and by removing all but two,\r\nprovision may be made for the issue of second swarms, and yet all\r\nafter-swarming be prevented. The process of returning after-swarms is\r\nnot only objectionable, on account of the time it requires, having often\r\nto be repeated again and again before one queen is allowed to destroy\r\nthe others; but it also causes a large portion of the gathering season\r\nto be wasted; for the bees seem unwilling to work with energy, so long\r\nas the pretensions of several rival queens are unsettled.\r\n\r\n3. Another very serious objection to Natural Swarming, as practiced with\r\nthe common hives, is the inability of the Apiarian who wishes rapidly to\r\nmultiply his colonies, to aid his late and small swarms, so as to build\r\nthem up into vigorous stocks. The time and money which are ordinarily\r\nspent upon small colonies, are almost always thrown away; by far the\r\nlarger portion of them never survive the Winter, and the majority of\r\nthose that do, are so enfeebled, as to be of little or no value. If they\r\nescape being robbed by stronger stocks, or destroyed by the moth, they\r\nseldom recruit in season to swarm, and very often the feeding must be\r\nrepeated, the second Fall, or they will at last perish. I doubt not that\r\nmany of my readers will, from their own experience, endorse every word\r\nof these remarks, as true to the very letter. All who have ever\r\nattempted to multiply colonies by nursing and feeding small swarms, on\r\nthe ordinary plans, have found it attended with nothing but loss and\r\nvexation. The more a man has of such stocks, the poorer he is: for by\r\ntheir weakness, they are constantly tempting his strong swarms to evil\r\ncourses; so that at last, they prefer to live as far as they can, by\r\nstealing, rather than by habits of honest industry; and if the feeble\r\ncolonies escape being plundered, they often become mere nurseries for\r\nraising a plentiful supply of moths, to ravage his whole Apiary.\r\n\r\nI have already shown, in what way by the use of my hives, the smallest\r\nswarms that ever issue, may be so managed as to become powerful stocks.\r\nIn the same way the Apiarian can easily strengthen all his colonies\r\nwhich are feeble in Spring.\r\n\r\n4. As the loss of the young queens in the parent stock after it has\r\nswarmed, and in the after-swarms, is a very common occurrence, a hive\r\nwhich like mine, furnishes the means of easily remedying this\r\nmisfortune, will greatly promote the success of those who practice\r\nnatural swarming. A very intelligent bee-keeper once assured me, that he\r\nmust use at least one such hive in his Apiary, for this purpose, even if\r\nin other respects it possessed no superior merits.\r\n\r\n5. Bees, as is well known, often refuse to swarm at all, and most of the\r\nswarming hives are so constructed, that proper accommodations for\r\nstoring honey, cannot be furnished to the super-abundant population.\r\nUnder such circumstances, they often hang for several months, in black\r\nmasses on the outside of the hive; and are worse than useless, as they\r\nconsume the honey which the others have gathered. In my hives, an\r\nabundance of room for storing honey can always be given them, _not all\r\nat once_, so as to prevent them from swarming, but by degrees, as their\r\nnecessities require: so that if they are indisposed, for any reason to\r\nswarm, they may have suitable receptacles easily accessible, and\r\nfurnished with guide comb to make them more attractive, in which to\r\nstore up any amount of honey that they can possibly collect.\r\n\r\n6. In the common hives, but little can be done to dislodge the bee-moth,\r\nwhen once it has gained the mastery of the bees; whereas in mine, it can\r\nbe most effectually rooted out when it has made a lodgment. (See Remarks\r\non Bee-Moth.)\r\n\r\n7. In the common hives, nothing can be done except with great\r\ndifficulty, to remove the old queen when her fertility is impaired;\r\nwhereas in my hives, (as will be shown in the Chapter on Artificial\r\nSwarming,) this can easily be effected, so that an Apiary may constantly\r\ncontain a stock of young queens, in the full vigor of their\r\nre-productive powers.\r\n\r\nI trust that these remarks will convince intelligent Apiarians, that I\r\nhave not spoken boastfully or at random, in asserting that natural\r\nswarming can be carried on with much greater certainty and success, by\r\nthe use of my hives, than in any other way; and that they will see that\r\nmany of the most perplexing embarrassments and mortifying\r\ndiscouragements under which they have hitherto prosecuted it, may be\r\neffectually remedied.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] Dr. Scudamore, an English physician who has written a small tract\r\non the formation of artificial swarms, says that he once knew \"as many\r\nas ten swarms go forth at once, and settle and mingle together, forming\r\nliterally a monster meeting!\" Instances are on record of a much larger\r\nnumber of swarms clustering together. A venerable clergyman, in Western\r\nMassachusetts, related to me the following remarkable occurrence. In the\r\nApiary of one of his parishioners, five swarms lit in one mass. As there\r\nwas no hive which would hold them, a very large box was roughly nailed\r\ntogether, and the bees were hived in it. They were taken up by sulphur\r\nin the Fall, when it was perfectly evident that the five swarms had\r\noccupied the same box as independent colonies. Four of them had\r\ncommenced their works, each one near a corner, and the fifth one in the\r\nmiddle, and there was a distinct interval separating the works of the\r\ndifferent colonies. In Cotton's \"My Bee Book,\" there is a cut\r\nillustrating a hive in which two colonies had built in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nARTIFICIAL SWARMING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe numerous efforts which have been made for the last fifty years or\r\nmore, to dispense with natural swarming, plainly indicate the anxiety of\r\nApiarians to find some better mode of increasing their colonies.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am able to propagate bees by natural swarming, with a\r\nrapidity and certainty unattainable except by the complete control of\r\nall the combs in the hive, still there are difficulties in this mode of\r\nincrease, inherent to the system itself, and therefore entirely\r\nincapable of being removed by any kind of hive. Before describing the\r\nvarious methods which I employ to increase colonies by artificial means,\r\nI shall first enumerate these difficulties, in order that each\r\nindividual bee-keeper may decide for himself, in which way he can most\r\nadvantageously propagate his bees.\r\n\r\n1. The large number of swarms lost every year, is a powerful argument\r\nagainst natural swarming.\r\n\r\nAn eminent Apiarian has estimated that one fourth of the best swarms are\r\nlost every season! This estimate can hardly be considered too high, if\r\nall who keep bees are taken into account. While some bee-keepers are so\r\ncareful that they seldom lose a swarm, the majority, either from the\r\ngrossest negligence, or from necessary hindrances during the swarming\r\nseason, are constantly incurring serious losses, by the flight of their\r\nbees to the woods. It is next to impossible, entirely to prevent such\r\noccurrences, if bees are allowed to swarm at all.\r\n\r\n2. The great amount of time and labor required by natural swarming, has\r\nalways been regarded as a decided objection to this mode of increase.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the swarming season begins, the Apiary must be closely\r\nwatched almost every day, or some of the new swarms will be lost. If\r\nthis business is entrusted to thoughtless children, or careless adults,\r\nmany swarms will be lost by their neglect. It is very evident that but\r\nfew persons who keep bees, can always be on hand to watch them and to\r\nhive the new swarms. But, in the height of the swarming season, if any\r\nconsiderable number of colonies is kept, the Apiarian, to guard against\r\nserious losses, should either be always on the spot himself, or have\r\nsome one who can be entrusted with the care of his bees. Even the\r\nSabbath cannot be observed as a day of rest; and often, instead of being\r\nable to go to the House of God, the bee-keeper is compelled to labor\r\namong his bees, as hard as on other days, or even harder. That he is as\r\njustifiable in hiving his bees on the Sabbath, as in taking care of his\r\nstock, can admit of no serious doubt; but the very liability of being\r\ncalled to do so, is with many, a sufficient objection against Apiarian\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\nThe merchant, mechanic and professional man, are often so situated that\r\nthey would take great interest in bees, if they were not deterred from\r\ntheir cultivation by inability to take care of them, during the swarming\r\nseason; and they are thus debarred from a pursuit, which is intensely\r\nfascinating, not merely to the lover of Nature, but to every one\r\npossessed of an inquiring mind. No man who spends some of his leisure\r\nhours in studying the wonderful habits and instincts of bees, will ever\r\ncomplain that he can find nothing to fill up his time out of the range\r\nof his business, or the gratification of his appetites. Bees may be kept\r\nwith great advantage, even in large cities, and those who are debarred\r\nfrom every other rural pursuit, may still listen to the soothing hum of\r\nthe industrious bee, and harvest annually its delicious nectar.\r\n\r\nIf the Apiarian could always be on hand during the swarming season, it\r\nwould still, in many instances, be exceedingly inconvenient for him to\r\nattend to his bees. How often is the farmer interrupted in the business\r\nof hay-making, by the cry that his bees are swarming; and by the time he\r\nhas hived them, perhaps a shower comes up, and his hay is injured more\r\nthan his swarm is worth. In this way, the keeping of a few bees, instead\r\nof a source of profit, often becomes rather an expensive luxury; and if\r\na very large stock is kept, the difficulties and embarrassments are\r\noften most seriously increased. If the weather becomes pleasant after a\r\nsuccession of days unfavorable for swarming, it often happens that\r\nseveral swarms rise at once, and cluster together, to the great\r\nannoyance of the Apiarian; and not unfrequently, in the noise and\r\nconfusion, other swarms fly off, and are entirely lost. I have seen the\r\nApiarian so perplexed and exhausted under such circumstances, as to be\r\nalmost ready to wish that he had never seen a bee.\r\n\r\n3. The managing of bees by natural swarming, must, in our country,\r\nalmost entirely prevent the establishment of large Apiaries.\r\n\r\nEven if it were possible, in this way, to multiply bees with certainty\r\nand rapidity, and without any of the perplexities which I have just\r\ndescribed, how few persons are so situated as to be able to give almost\r\nthe whole of their time in the busiest part of the year, to the\r\nmanagement of their bees. The swarming season is with the farmer, the\r\nvery busiest part of the whole year, and if he purposes to keep a large\r\nnumber of swarming hives, he must not only devote nearly the whole of\r\nhis time, for a number of weeks, to their supervision, but at a season\r\nwhen labor commands the highest price, he will often be compelled to\r\nhire additional assistance.\r\n\r\nI have long been convinced that, as a general rule, the keeping of a few\r\ncolonies in swarming hives, costs more than they are worth, and that the\r\nkeeping of a very large number is entirely out of the question, unless\r\nwith those who are so situated that they can afford to devote their\r\ntime, for about two months every year, almost entirely to their bees.\r\nThe number of persons who can afford to do this must be very small; and\r\nI have seldom heard of a bee-keeper, in our country, who has an Apiary\r\non a scale extensive enough to make bee-keeping anything more than a\r\nsubordinate pursuit. Multitudes have tried to make it a large and\r\nremunerating business, but hitherto, I believe that they have nearly all\r\nbeen disappointed in their expectations. In such countries as Poland and\r\nRussia where labor is deplorably cheap, it may be done to great\r\nadvantage; but never to any considerable extent in our own.\r\n\r\n4. A serious objection to natural swarming, is the discouraging fact\r\nthat the bees often refuse to swarm at all, and the Apiarian finds it\r\nimpossible to multiply his colonies with any certainty or rapidity, even\r\nalthough he may find himself in all respects favorably situated for the\r\ncultivation of bees, and may be exceedingly anxious to engage in the\r\nbusiness on a much more extensive scale.\r\n\r\nI am acquainted with many careful bee-keepers who have managed their\r\nbees according to the most reliable information they could obtain,\r\nnever destroying any of their colonies, and endeavoring to multiply them\r\nto the best of their ability, who yet have not as many stocks as they\r\nhad ten years ago. Most of them would abandon the pursuit, if they\r\nlooked upon bee-keeping simply in the light of dollars and cents, rather\r\nthan as a source of pleasant recreation; and some do not hesitate to say\r\nthat much more money has been spent, by the mass of those who have used\r\npatent hives, than they have ever realized from their bees.\r\n\r\nIt is a very simple matter to make calculations on paper, which shall\r\nseem to point out a road to wealth, almost as flattering, as a tour to\r\nthe gold mines of Australia or California. Only purchase a patent\r\nbee-hive, and if it fulfills all or even a part of the promises of its\r\nsanguine inventor, a fortune must, in the course of a few years, be\r\ncertainly realized; but such are the disappointments resulting from the\r\nbees refusing often to swarm at all, that if the hive could remedy all\r\nthe other difficulties in the way of bee-keeping, it would still fail to\r\nanswer the reasonable wishes of the experienced Apiarian. If every swarm\r\nof bees could be made to yield a profit of 20 dollars a year, and if the\r\nApiarian could be sure of selling his new swarms at the most extravagant\r\nprices, he could not, like the growers of mulberry trees, or the\r\nbreeders of fancy fowls, multiply his stocks so as to meet the demand,\r\nhowever extensive; but would be entirely dependent upon the whims and\r\ncaprices of his bees; or rather, upon the natural laws which control\r\ntheir swarming.\r\n\r\nEvery practical bee-keeper is well aware of the utter uncertainty of\r\nnatural swarming. Under no circumstances, can its occurrence be\r\nconfidently relied on. While some stocks swarm regularly and repeatedly,\r\nothers, strong in numbers and rich in stores, although the season may,\r\nin all respects, be propitious, refuse to swarm at all. Such colonies,\r\non examination, will often be found to have taken no steps for raising\r\nyoung queens. In some cases, the wings of the old mother will be found\r\ndefective, while in others, she is abundantly able to fly, but seems to\r\nprefer the riches of the old hive, to the risks attending the formation\r\nof a new colony. It frequently happens, in our uncertain climate, that\r\nwhen all the necessary preparations have been made for swarming, the\r\nweather proves unpropitious for so long a time, that the young queens\r\ncoming to maturity before the old one can leave, are all destroyed. This\r\nis a very frequent occurrence, and under such circumstances, swarming is\r\nalmost certain to be prevented, for that season. The young queens are\r\nfrequently destroyed, even although the weather is pleasant, in\r\nconsequence of some sudden and perhaps only temporary suspension of the\r\nhoney-harvest; for bees seldom colonize even if all their preparations\r\nare completed, unless the flowers are yielding an abundant supply of\r\nhoney.\r\n\r\nFrom these and other causes which my limits will not permit me to\r\nnotice, it has hitherto been found impossible, in the uncertain climate\r\nof our Northern States, to multiply colonies very rapidly, by natural\r\nswarming; and bee-keeping, on this plan, offers very poor inducements to\r\nthose who are aware how little has been accomplished, even by the most\r\nenthusiastic, experienced and energetic Apiarians.\r\n\r\nThe numerous perplexities which have ever attended natural swarming,\r\nhave for ages, directed the attention of practical cultivators, to the\r\nimportance of devising some more reliable method of increasing their\r\ncolonies. Columella, who lived about the middle of the first century of\r\nthe Christian Era, and who wrote twelve books on husbandry (De re\r\nrustica,) has given directions for making artificial colonies. He says,\r\n\"you must examine the hive, and view what honey-combs it has; then\r\nafterwards from the wax which contains the seeds of the young bees, you\r\nmust cut away that part wherein the offspring of the royal brood is\r\nanimated: for this is easy to be seen; because at the very end of the\r\nwax-works there appears, as it were, a thimble-like process (somewhat\r\nsimilar to an acorn,) rising higher, and having a wider cavity, than the\r\nrest of the holes, wherein the young bees of vulgar note are contained.\"\r\n\r\nHyginus, who flourished before Columella, had evidently noticed the\r\nroyal jelly; for he speaks of cells larger than those of the common\r\nbees, \"filled as it were with a solid substance of a _red color_, out of\r\nwhich the winged king is at first formed.\" This ancient observer must\r\nundoubtedly have seen the quince-like jelly, a portion of which is\r\nalways found at the base of the royal cells, after the queens have\r\nemerged. The ancients generally called the queen a king, although\r\nAristotle says that some in his time called her the mother. Swammerdam\r\nwas the first to prove by dissection that the queen is a perfect female,\r\nand the only one in the hive, and that the drone is the male.\r\n\r\nFor reasons which I shall shortly mention, the ancient methods of\r\nartificial increase appear to have met with but small success. Towards\r\nthe close of the last century, a new impulse was given to the artificial\r\nproduction of swarms, by the discovery of Schirach, a German clergyman,\r\nthat bees are able to rear a queen from worker-brood. For want, however,\r\nof a more thorough knowledge of some important principles in the economy\r\nof the bee, these efforts met with slender encouragement.\r\n\r\nHuber, after his splendid discoveries in the physiology of the bee,\r\nperceived at once, the importance of multiplying colonies by some method\r\nmore reliable than that of natural swarming. His leaf or book hive\r\nconsisted of 12 frames, each an inch and a half in width; any one of\r\nwhich could be opened at pleasure. He recommends forming artificial\r\nswarms, by dividing one of these hives into two parts; adding to each\r\npart six empty frames. After using a Huber hive for a number of years, I\r\nbecame perfectly convinced that it could only be made servicable, by an\r\nadroit, experienced and fearless Apiarian. The bees fasten the frames in\r\nsuch a manner, with their propolis, that they cannot, except with\r\nextreme care, be opened without jarring the bees, and exciting their\r\nanger; nor can they be shut without constant danger of crushing them.\r\nHuber nowhere speaks of having multiplied colonies extensively by such\r\nhives, and although they have been in use more than sixty years, they\r\nhave never been successfully employed for such a purpose. If Huber had\r\nonly contrived a plan for suspending his frames, instead of folding them\r\ntogether like the leaves of a book, I believe that the cause of Apiarian\r\nscience would have been fifty years in advance of what it now is.\r\n\r\nDividing hives of various kinds have been used in this country. After\r\ngiving some of the best of them a thorough trial, and inventing others\r\nwhich somewhat resembled the Huber hive, I found that they could not\r\npossibly be made to answer any valuable end in securing artificial\r\nswarms. For a long time I felt that the plan _ought_ to succeed, and it\r\nwas not until I had made numerous experiments with my hive substantially\r\nas now constructed, that I ascertained the precise causes of failure.\r\n\r\nIt may be regarded as one of the laws of the bee-hive, that bees, when\r\nnot in possession of a mature queen, seldom build any comb except such\r\nas being designed merely for storing honey, is _too coarse for the\r\nrearing of workers_. Until I became acquainted with the discoveries of\r\nDzierzon, I supposed myself to be the only observer who had noticed\r\nthis remarkable fact, and who had been led by it, to modify the whole\r\nsystem of artificial swarming. The perusal of Mr. Wagner's manuscript\r\ntranslation of that author, showed me that he had arrived at precisely\r\nsimilar results.\r\n\r\nIt may seem at first, very unaccountable that bees should go on to fill\r\ntheir hives with comb unfit for breeding, when the young queen will so\r\nsoon require worker-cells for her eggs; but it must be borne in mind,\r\nthat bees, under such circumstances, are always in an _unnatural_ state.\r\nThey are attempting to rear a new queen in a hive which is only\r\npartially filled with comb; whereas, if left to follow their own\r\ninstincts, they never construct royal cells except in hives which are\r\nwell filled with comb, for it is only in such hives that they make any\r\npreparations for swarming. It must be confessed that they do not show\r\ntheir ordinary sagacity in filling a hive with unsuitable comb; but if\r\nit were not for a few instances of this kind of bad management, we\r\nshould perhaps, form too exalted an idea of their intelligence, and\r\nshould almost fail to notice the marked distinction between reason in\r\nman, and even the most refined instincts of some of the animals by which\r\nhe is surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe determination of bees, when they have no mature queen, if they build\r\nany comb at all, to build such as is suited only for storing honey, and\r\nunfit for breeding, will show at once, the folly of attempting to\r\nmultiply colonies by the dividing-hives. Even if the Apiarian has been\r\nperfectly successful in dividing a colony, and the part without a queen\r\ntakes the necessary steps to supply her loss, if the bees are\r\nsufficiently numerous to build a large quantity of new comb, (and they\r\nought to be in order to make the artificial colony of any value,) they\r\nwill build this comb in such a manner that it will answer only for\r\nstoring honey, while they will use the half of the hive with the old\r\ncomb, for the purposes of breeding. The next year, if an attempt is made\r\nto divide this hive, one half will contain nearly all the brood and\r\nmature bees, while the other, having most of the honey, in combs unfit\r\nfor breeding, the new colony formed from it will be a complete failure.\r\n\r\nEven with a Huber hive, the plan of multiplying colonies by dividing a\r\nfull hive into two parts, and adding an empty half to each, will be\r\nattended with serious difficulties; although some of them may be\r\nremedied in consequence of the hive being constructed so as to divide\r\ninto many parts; the very attempt to remedy them, however, will be found\r\nto require a degree of skill and knowledge far in advance of what can be\r\nexpected of the great mass of bee-keepers.\r\n\r\nThe common dividing hives, separating into two parts, can never, under\r\nany circumstances, be made of the least practical value; and the\r\nbusiness of multiplying colonies by them, will be found far more\r\nlaborious, uncertain and vexatious, than to rely on natural swarming. I\r\ndo not know of a solitary practical Apiarian, who, on trial of this\r\nsystem, has not been compelled to abandon it, and allow the bees to\r\nswarm from his dividing hives in the old-fashioned way.\r\n\r\nSome Apiarians have attempted to multiply their colonies by putting a\r\npiece of brood comb containing the materials for raising a new queen,\r\ninto an empty hive, set in the place of a strong stock which has been\r\nremoved to a new stand when thousands of its inmates were abroad in the\r\nfields. This method is still worse than the one which has just been\r\ndescribed. In the dividing hive, the bees already had a large amount of\r\nsuitable comb for breeding, while in this having next to none, they\r\nbuild all their combs until the queen is hatched, of a size unsuitable\r\nfor rearing workers. In the first case, the queenless part of the\r\ndividing hive may have had a young queen almost mature, so that the\r\nprocess of building large combs would be of short continuance; for as\r\nsoon as the young queen begins to lay, the bees at once commence\r\nbuilding combs adapted to the reception of worker eggs. In some of my\r\nattempts to rear artificial swarms by moving a full stock, as described\r\nabove, I have had combs built of enormous size, nearly four inches\r\nthrough! and these monster combs have afterwards been pieced out on\r\ntheir lower edge, with worker cells for the accommodation of the young\r\nqueen! So uniformly do the bees with an unhatched queen, build in the\r\nway described, that I can often tell at a single glance, by seeing what\r\nkind of comb they are building, that a hive is queenless, or that having\r\nbeen so, they have now a fertile young queen. When a new colony is\r\nformed, by dividing the old hive, the queenless part has thousands of\r\ncells filled with brood and eggs, and young bees will be hourly\r\nhatching, for at least three weeks: and by this time, the young queen\r\nwill be laying eggs, so that there will be an interval of not more than\r\nthree weeks, during which no accessions will be made to the numbers of\r\nthe colony. But when a new swarm is formed by moving, not an egg will be\r\ndeposited for nearly three weeks; and not a bee will be hatched for\r\nnearly six weeks; and during all this time, the colony will rapidly\r\ndecrease, until by the time that the progeny of the young queen begins\r\nto emerge from their cells, the number of bees in the new hive will be\r\nso small, that it would be of no value, even if its combs were of the\r\nbest construction.\r\n\r\nEvery observing bee-keeper must have noticed how rapidly even a powerful\r\nswarm diminishes in number, for the first three weeks after it has been\r\nhived. In many cases, before the young begin to hatch, it does not\r\ncontain one half its original number; so very great is the mortality of\r\nbees during the height of the working season.\r\n\r\nI have most thoroughly tested, in the only way in which it can be\r\npracticed in the ordinary hives, this last plan of artificial swarming,\r\nand do not hesitate to say that it does not possess the very slightest\r\npractical value; and as this is the method which Apiarians have usually\r\ntried, it is not strange that they have almost unanimously pronounced\r\nArtificial swarming to be utterly worthless. The experience of Dzierzon\r\non this point has been the same with my own.\r\n\r\nAnother method of artificial swarming has been zealously advocated,\r\nwhich, if it could only be made to answer, would be, of all conceivable\r\nplans the most effectual, and as it would require the smallest amount of\r\nlabor, experience, or skill, would be everywhere practiced. A number of\r\nhives must be put in connection with each other, so as to communicate by\r\nholes which allow the bees to travel from any one apartment to the\r\nothers. The bees, on this plan, are to _colonize themselves_, and in\r\ntime, a single swarm will, of its own accord, multiply so as to form a\r\nlarge number of independent families, each one possessing its own queen,\r\nand all living in perfect harmony.\r\n\r\nThis method so beautiful and fascinating in theory, has been repeatedly\r\ntried with various ingenious modifications, but in every instance, as\r\nfar as I know, it has proved an entire failure. It will always be found\r\nif bees are allowed to pass from one hive to another, that they will\r\nstill, for the most part, confine their breeding operations to a single\r\napartment, if it is of the ordinary size, while the others will be used,\r\nchiefly for the storing of honey. This is almost invariably the case, if\r\nthe additional room is given by collateral or side boxes, as the queen\r\nseldom enters such apartments for the purpose of breeding. If the new\r\nhive is directly _below_ that in which the swarm is first lodged, then\r\nif the connections are suitable, the queen will be almost certain to\r\ndescend and lay her eggs in the new combs, as soon as they are commenced\r\nby the bees; in this case, the upper hive is almost entirely abandoned\r\nby her, and the bees store the cells with honey, as fast as the brood is\r\nhatched, as their instinct impels them always, if they can, to keep\r\ntheir stores of honey _above_ the breeding cells. So long as bees have\r\nan abundance of room below their main hive, they will never swarm, but\r\nwill use it in the way that I have described; if the room is on the\r\nsides of their hive, and very accessible, they seldom swarm, but if it\r\nis above them, they frequently prefer to swarm rather than to take\r\npossession of it. But in none of these cases, do they ever, _if left to\r\nthemselves_, form separate and independent colonies.\r\n\r\nI am aware that the Apiarian, by separating from the main hive with a\r\nslide, an apartment that contains brood, and directing to it by some\r\nartificial contrivance a considerable number of bees, may succeed in\r\nrearing an artificial colony; but unless all his hives admit of the most\r\nthorough inspection, as he can never know their exact condition, he must\r\nalways work in the dark, and will be much more likely to fail than\r\nsucceed. Success indeed can only be possible when a skillful Apiarian\r\ndevotes a large portion of his time to watching and managing his bees,\r\nso as to _compel_ them to colonize, and even then it will be very\r\nuncertain; so that this plausible theory to be reduced to even a most\r\nprecarious practice, requires more skill, care, labor and time, than are\r\nnecessary to manage the ordinary swarming hives.\r\n\r\nThe failure of so many attempts to increase colonies by artificial\r\nmeans, as well in the hands of scientific and experienced Apiarians, as\r\nunder the direction of those who are almost totally ignorant of the\r\nphysiology of the bee, has led many to prefer to use non-swarming hives.\r\nIn this way, very large harvests of honey are often obtained from a\r\npowerful stock of bees; but it is very evident that if the increase of\r\nnew colonies were entirely discouraged, the insect would soon be\r\nexterminated. To prevent this, the advocates of the non-swarming plan,\r\nmust either have their bees swarm, to some extent, or rely upon those\r\nwho do.\r\n\r\nMy hive may be used as a non-swarmer, and may be made more effectually\r\nto prevent swarming, than any with which I am acquainted: as in the\r\nSpring, (See No. 34. p. 104,) ample accommodations may be given to the\r\nbees, below their main works, and when this is seasonably done, swarming\r\nwill _never_ take place.\r\n\r\nThere are certain objections however, which must always prevent the\r\nnon-swarming plan from being the most successful mode of managing bees.\r\nTo say nothing of the loss to the bee-keeper, who has, after some years,\r\nonly one stock, when if the natural mode of increase had been allowed,\r\nhe ought to have a number, it is usually found that after bees have been\r\nkept in a non-swarming hive for several seasons, they seem to work with\r\nmuch less vigor than usual. Of this, any one may convince himself, who\r\nwill compare the industrious working of a new swarm, with that of a much\r\nmore powerful stock in a non-swarming hive. The former will work with\r\nsuch astonishing zeal, that to one unacquainted with the facts, it would\r\nbe taken to be by far the more powerful stock.\r\n\r\nAs the fertility of the queen decreases by age, the disadvantage of\r\nusing non-swarming hives of the ordinary construction, will be obvious.\r\nThis objection to the system can be remedied in my hive, as the old\r\nqueen can be easily caught and removed; but when hives are used in which\r\nthis cannot be done, the Apiary, instead of containing a race of young\r\nqueens in the full vigor of their reproductive powers, will contain many\r\nthat have passed their prime, and these old queens may die when there\r\nare no eggs in the hive to enable the bees to replace them, and thus the\r\nwhole colony will perish.\r\n\r\nIf the bee-keeper wishes to winter only a certain number of stocks, I\r\nwill, in another place, show him a way in which this can be done, so as\r\nto obtain more honey from them, than from an equal number kept on the\r\nnon-swarming plan, while at the same time, they may all be maintained in\r\na state of the highest health and vigor.\r\n\r\nI shall now describe a method of artificial swarming, which may be\r\nsuccessfully practiced with almost any hive, by those who have\r\nsufficient experience in the management of bees.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that natural swarming may be expected, a populous hive,\r\nrich in stores is selected, and what I shall call a _forced swarm_ is\r\nobtained from it, by the following process. Choose that part of a\r\npleasant day, say from 10 A. M. to 2 P. M., when the largest number of\r\nbees are abroad in the fields; if any bees are clustered in front of the\r\nhive, or on the bottom-board, puff among them a few whiffs of smoke from\r\nburning rags or paper, so as to force them to go up among the combs.\r\nThis can be done with greater ease, if the hive is elevated, by small\r\nwedges, about one quarter of an inch above the bottom-board. Have an\r\nempty hive or box in readiness, the diameter of which is as nearly as\r\npossible, the same with that of the hive from which you intend to drive\r\nthe swarm. Lift the hive very gently, and without the slightest jar,\r\nfrom its bottom-board; invert it and carry it in the same careful\r\nmanner, about a rod from its old stand, as bees are always much more\r\ninclined to be peaceable, when removed a short distance, than when any\r\noperation is performed on the familiar spot. If the hive is carefully\r\nplaced on the ground, upside down, scarcely a single bee will fly out,\r\nand there will be little danger of being stung. Timid and inexperienced\r\nApiarians will, of course, protect themselves with a bee-dress, and they\r\nmay have an assistant to sprinkle the hive gently with sugar-water, as\r\nsoon as it is inverted. After placing the hive in an inverted position\r\non the ground, the empty hive must be put over it, and every crack from\r\nwhich a bee might escape, must be carefully closed with paper or any\r\nconvenient material. The upper hive ought to be furnished with two or\r\nthree slats, about an inch and a half wide, and fastened one third of\r\nthe distance from the top, so as to give the bees every opportunity to\r\ncluster.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Apiarian is perfectly sure that the bees cannot escape,\r\nhe should place an empty hive upon the stand from which they were\r\nremoved, so that the multitudes which return from the fields may enter\r\nit, instead of dispersing to other hives, where some of them may meet\r\nwith a very unkind reception; although as a general rule, a bee with a\r\nload of freshly gathered honey, after the extent of his resources is\r\nascertained, is almost always, welcomed by any hive to which he may\r\ncarry his treasures; while a poor unfortunate that ventures to present\r\nitself empty and poverty stricken, is generally at once destroyed! The\r\none meets with as friendly a reception as a wealthy gentleman who\r\nproposes to take up his abode in a country village, while the other is\r\nas much an object of dislike as a pauper who is suspected of wishing to\r\nbecome a parish charge!\r\n\r\nTo return to our imprisoned bees. Beginning at the top, or what is now,\r\n(as the hive is upside down,) the bottom, their hive should be beaten\r\nsmartly with two small rods on the front and back, or on the sides to\r\nwhich the combs are attached, so as to run no risk of loosening them.\r\nIf the hive when removed from its stand was put upon a stool or table,\r\nor something not so solid as the ground, the drumming will cause more\r\nmotion, and yet be less apt to start any of the combs. These \"rappings\"\r\nwhich certainly are not of a very \"spiritual\" character, produce\r\nnevertheless, a most decided effect upon the bees: their first impulse\r\nis to sally out and wreak their vengeance upon those who have thus\r\nrudely assailed their honied dome; but as soon as they find that they\r\nare shut in, a sudden fear that they are to be driven from their\r\ntreasures, seems to take possession of them. If the two hives have glass\r\nwindows, so that all the operations can be witnessed, the bees, in a few\r\nmoments, will be seen most busily engaged in gorging themselves with\r\nhoney. During all this time, the rapping must be continued, and in about\r\nfive minutes, nearly every bee will have filled itself to its utmost\r\ncapacity, and they are now prepared for their forced emigration; a\r\nprodigious hum is heard, and the bees begin to mount into the upper box.\r\nIn about ten minutes from the time the rapping began, the mass of the\r\nbees with their queen will have ascended, and will hang clustered, just\r\nlike a natural swarm. The box with the expelled bees must now be gently\r\nlifted off, and should be placed upon a bottom-board with a gauze wire\r\nventilator, so that the bees may be confined, and yet have plenty of\r\nair. A shallow vessel or a piece of old comb containing water, ought to\r\nbe first placed on the bottom-board. If no gauze wire bottom-board is at\r\nhand, the hive must be wedged up, so as to admit an abundance of air,\r\nand be set in a shady place.\r\n\r\nThe hive from which the bees were driven, must now be set, without\r\ncrushing any of the bees, on its old spot, in the place of the decoy\r\nhive, that all the bees which have returned from abroad, may enter.\r\nBefore this change is made, these bees will be running in and out of\r\nthe empty hive, (See p. 72,) but as soon as the opportunity is given\r\nthem, they will crowd into their well-known home, and if there are no\r\nroyal cells started, will proceed, almost at once, to construct them,\r\nand the next day they will act as though the forced swarm had left of\r\nits own accord. When the operation is delayed until about the season for\r\nnatural swarming, the hive will contain immature queens, if the bees\r\nwere intending to swarm, and a new queen will soon take the place of the\r\nold one, just as in natural swarming. If it is performed too early, and\r\nbefore the drones have made their appearance, the young queen may not be\r\nseasonably impregnated, and the parent stock will perish.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious that this whole process, in order to be successfully\r\nperformed, requires a knowledge of the most important points in the\r\neconomy of the bee-hive; indeed the same remark may be made of almost\r\nany operation, and those who are willing to remain ignorant of the laws\r\nwhich regulate the breeding of bees, ought not to depart in the least,\r\nfrom the old-fashioned mode of management. All such deviations will only\r\nbe attended with a wanton sacrifice of bees. A man may use the common\r\nswarming hives a whole life-time, and yet remain ignorant of the very\r\nfirst principles in the physiology of the bee, unless he gains his\r\ninformation from other sources; while, by the use of my hives, any\r\nintelligent cultivator may, in a single season, verify for himself, the\r\ndiscoveries which have only been made by the accumulated toil of many\r\nobservers, for more than two thousand years. The ease with which\r\nApiarians may now, by the sight of their own eyes, gain a knowledge of\r\nall the important facts in the economy of the hive, will stimulate them\r\nmost powerfully, to study the nature of the bee and thus to prepare\r\nthemselves for an enlightened system of management.\r\n\r\nIn giving directions for the creation of forced swarms, I advised that\r\nit should be done during the pleasantest part of the day, when the\r\nlargest number of bees are foraging abroad. If the operation is\r\nperformed when all the bees are at home, and they are all driven into\r\nthe empty hive, the old hive will be so depopulated that many of the\r\nyoung will perish for want of suitable attention, and the parent stock\r\nwill be greatly deteriorated in value. If only a part of the bees are\r\nexpelled, the queen may be left behind, and the whole operation will be\r\na failure, and at best it will be difficult to make a suitable division\r\nof the bees between the two hives. Indeed, under any circumstances, this\r\nis the most difficult part of the process, and it often requires no\r\nlittle judgment to equalize the two colonies.\r\n\r\nSome recommend placing the forced swarm on the old stand, and removing\r\nthe parent hive with the bees that are deemed sufficient, to a new\r\nplace. If this is done, and the bees have their liberty, so many of them\r\nwill leave for the familiar spot, that the hive will be almost deserted,\r\nand a very large proportion of its brood will perish. The bees in this\r\nhive, if it is to be set in a new place, must have water given to them,\r\nand be so shut up as to have an abundance of air, until late in the\r\nafternoon of the third day, when the hive may be opened, and they will\r\ntake wing, almost as though they were intending to swarm. Some will even\r\nthen, return to the place where they originally stood, and join the\r\nforced swarm, but the most of them, after hovering in the air for a\r\nshort time, will re-enter the hive. During the time that they have been\r\nshut up, thousands of young bees will have emerged from their cells, and\r\nthese, knowing no other home, will aid in taking care of the larvæ, and\r\nin carrying on the work of the hive.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to make an equitable division at the time of driving\r\nout the bees, I prefer to expel all that I can, and to rely upon the\r\nbees returning from their gatherings, to replenish the old stock. If the\r\nnumber appears to be too small, I open temporarily the entrance of the\r\nhive containing the forced swarm, and permit as many as I judge best, to\r\ncome out and enter their old abode. It must here be borne in mind, that\r\nbees which are thus ejected from a hive, do not, in all respects, act\r\nlike a natural swarm, which having left the parent stock, of its own\r\naccord, never seeks, unless it has lost its queen, to return; whereas,\r\nmany of the forced swarm, as soon as they leave the hive into which they\r\nhave been driven, will return to their former abode. The same is true of\r\nbees which are moved to any distance not far enough to be beyond the\r\nlimits of their previous excursions in search of food. If we could only\r\nmake our bees when moved, or forced to swarm, adhere to their hives as\r\nfaithfully as a natural swarm, many difficulties which now perplex us,\r\nwould be at once removed.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained that the parent hive contains a sufficient number of\r\nbees to carry on operations, about sun-set, after the bees are all at\r\nhome, it may be removed to a new stand, and the bees, after being\r\nsupplied with water, must be shut up, according to the directions\r\npreviously given. If the hive is so constructed that water cannot be\r\nconveniently given them, the following plan I have found to answer most\r\nadmirably. Bore a small hole towards the top on the front side, and with\r\na straw, water may be injected with scarcely any trouble. A mouthful\r\nonce or twice a day, will be sufficient. If the bees are confined\r\nwithout water, they will not be able to prepare the food for the larvæ,\r\nand multitudes of them must necessarily perish.\r\n\r\nThe expelled colony must be placed, on the same evening, precisely where\r\nthe hive from which they were driven stood, and have their liberty\r\ngiven to them. The next morning, they will work with as much vigor as\r\nthough they had swarmed in the natural way.\r\n\r\nThe directions which have here been given for creating forced swarms,\r\nwill be found to differ in some important respects from any which other\r\nApiarians have previously furnished. I have already shown that it is\r\ndifficult to secure the right number of bees for the parent stock,\r\nunless it is set temporarily on its old stand, so as to catch up the\r\nreturning bees. The common plan has been to try to leave in it, as many\r\nbees as are needed, and then to shut it up for a few days, having placed\r\nit in a new spot, while the forced swarm is immediately replaced so that\r\nall the stragglers may be added to it. If we could always be sure of\r\ndriving out the queen, and with her, as many bees as we want and _no\r\nmore_, this would undoubtedly be the simplest plan; but for the reasons\r\nalready assigned, it will be found a very precarious operation.\r\n\r\nSome Apiarians recommend putting the forced swarm in a new place in the\r\nApiary; but as large numbers of the bees will be sure, when they go out\r\nto work, to return to the familiar spot, the new colony will often be so\r\nseriously depopulated as to be of but little value. If the Apiarian can\r\nremove his forced swarms, some two or three miles off, he may give them\r\ntheir liberty at once, and in the course of a few weeks, he can, without\r\nrisk, bring them back to his Apiary.\r\n\r\nIf he chooses, he may allow the parent stock to remain on the old stand,\r\nand confine the forced swarm, until about an hour before sun set of the\r\nthird day. They must in the mean time be supplied with both honey and\r\nwater, and if they cannot be kept cool and quiet, they should be removed\r\ninto the cellar until they are placed in their new position. Many will\r\neven then return to the old spot, but not enough to interfere seriously\r\nwith their prosperity. If the bees cannot, as in my hives, be kept cool\r\nand dark, they will be excessively uneasy, and may suffer very seriously\r\nfrom so long confinement: hence the very great importance of setting\r\nthem in the cellar.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange, that bees, when their hive is moved, or when they\r\nare forcibly expelled from it, should not adhere to the new spot, just\r\nas when they have swarmed of their own accord. In each case, as soon as\r\na bee leaves its new place, it flies with its head turned towards the\r\nhive, in order to mark the surrounding objects, that it may be able to\r\nreturn to the same spot; but when they have not emigrated of their own\r\naccord, many of them seem, when they rise in the air, or return from\r\nwork, entirely to forget that their location has been changed; and they\r\nreturn to the place where they have lived so long, and if no hive is\r\nthere, they often die on the deserted and desolate, yet home-like spot.\r\nIf, on the contrary, they swarmed of their own accord, they seldom, if\r\never, make such a mistake. It may truly be said that\r\n\r\n    \"A 'bee removed' against its will\r\n    Is of the same opinion still.\"\r\n\r\nI have been thus minute in describing the whole process of creating\r\nforced swarms, not merely on account of the importance of the plan in\r\nmultiplying colonies, but because the driving or drumming out of bees\r\nfrom a common hive, is employed with great success in a variety of ways\r\nwhich will be hereafter specified. I doubt not that many bee-keepers, on\r\nreading this mode of creating colonies, are ready to object that it not\r\nonly requires more skill, but more time and labor, than to allow them to\r\nswarm, and then to hive them in the old-fashioned way.\r\n\r\nAs practiced with ordinary hives, it is undoubtedly liable to this\r\nserious objection, and I would easily with my basket hiver, undertake to\r\nhive four natural swarms, in the time that it would require to create\r\none forced swarm; to say nothing of the care which must be bestowed upon\r\nthe artificial swarms, with their parent stocks, after the driving\r\nprocess has been completed. For this reason, I do not advise the\r\nbee-keeper to force his swarms from the common hives, until he has first\r\nascertained that they are not likely to swarm in tolerably good season,\r\nof their own accord, unless he is afraid that they will come out during\r\nhis absence, and decamp to the woods.\r\n\r\nBy the aid of my hives, this process may be most expeditiously\r\nperformed. An empty hive, with its frames furnished with guide combs,\r\nmust be in readiness. The cover of the full hive should be removed, and\r\nthe bees gently sprinkled with sugar-water from a watering pot that\r\ndischarges a fine stream. In about two minutes, the frames may be taken\r\nout, and the bees, by a quick motion, shaken on a sheet directly in\r\nfront of their hive. As fast as a comb is deprived of its bees, it\r\nshould be set in a proper position in the new hive, and an empty frame\r\nput in its place. Two or three of the combs containing brood, eggs, &c.,\r\nshould be left in the old hive, as well to give them greater\r\nencouragement, as to prevent them from being dissatisfied if their queen\r\nshould, by any possibility, be taken from them. In removing the frames\r\nwith the bees, I always look for the queen, and if I see her, as I\r\ngenerally do, I return to the hive the frame which contains her, without\r\nshaking off the bees. In that case, I put several of the necessary combs\r\ninto the new hive, with all the bees upon them.\r\n\r\nIn dislodging the bees upon the sheet, I do not shake them all off from\r\nthe frames; but leave about one quarter of them on, and put them with\r\nthe combs into the new hive. I never knew the queen to be left on a\r\nframe after it was shaken so that the larger portion of the bees would\r\nfall off. As soon as the operation is completed, and the necessary\r\nnumber of bees have been transferred with their comb to the new hive, it\r\nshould be managed according to the directions previously given, in the\r\ncase of the old hive from which a swarm was drummed out.\r\n\r\nIf in the operation the Apiarian does not see the queen, he must, in the\r\ncourse of the third day, examine the hive having the larger portion of\r\nbees, and if they have commenced building royal cells among the combs\r\ngiven to them, he may be certain that she is in the other hive. The comb\r\ncontaining the royal cells may then be transferred to that hive, and the\r\nqueen searched for, and returned with the combs on which she is found,\r\nto her proper place. A little experience, however, will enable the\r\noperator to be sure from the first, that the queen is with the right\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nTo most persons, it would seem to be of little consequence, in which\r\nhive the queen is placed: but if the bees which have only a few frames\r\nof comb, are compelled to rear another, they will be sure to fill their\r\nhive with comb unfit for breeding purposes, and will also be so long\r\nbefore they can have additions to their number, as to be of but little\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nIf many swarms are to be created in this manner, and the operation is\r\ndelayed until near swarming time, in some of them, numerous royal cells\r\nwill be found, so that each stock which has no queen, may have one\r\nnearly mature, given to it, and thus much valuable time may be saved.\r\n\r\nBy making a few forced swarms, about a week or ten days before the time\r\nin which the most will be made, the Apiarian may be sure of having an\r\nabundance of sealed queens almost mature, so that every swarm may have\r\none. If he can give each hive that needs it, an unhatched queen, without\r\nremoving her from her frame, so much the better; but if he has not\r\nenough frames with sealed queens, while some of them contain two or more\r\nqueens, he must proceed as follows:\r\n\r\nWith a very sharp knife, carefully cut out a queen cell, on a piece of\r\ncomb an inch or more square; cut a place in one of the combs of the hive\r\nto which this cell is to be given, just about large enough to receive it\r\nin a natural position, and if it is not secure, put a little melted wax\r\nwith a feather, where the edges meet. The bees will soon fasten it, so\r\nas to make all right. Unless very great care is used in transferring\r\nthese royal cells, the enclosed queens will be destroyed; as their\r\nbodies, until they are nearly mature, are so exceedingly soft, that a\r\nvery slight compression of their cell often kills them. For this reason,\r\nI prefer not to remove them, until they are within three or four days of\r\nhatching. As the forcing of a swarm may always be conducted, with my\r\nhives, in such a manner that the Apiarian can be sure to effect a\r\nsuitable division of the bees, the process may be performed at any time\r\nwhen the sun is above the horizon, and the weather is not too\r\nunpleasant. It ought not to be attempted when the weather is so cool as\r\nto endanger the destruction of the brood, by a chill; and never unless\r\nwhen there is not only sufficient light to enable the Apiarian to see\r\ndistinctly, but enough for the bees that take wing, to see the hive, and\r\ndirect their flight to its entrance. If hives are meddled with, when it\r\nis dark, the bees are always more irascible, and as they cannot see\r\nwhere to fly, they will constantly be alighting upon the person of the\r\nbee-keeper, who will be almost sure to receive some stings. I have\r\nseldom attempted night-work upon my bees, without having occasion most\r\nthoroughly to rue my folly. If the weather is not too cool, early in the\r\nmorning, before the bees are stirring, will be the best time, as there\r\nwill be less danger of annoyance from robber-bees.\r\n\r\nIf honey-water is used instead of sugar-water in sprinkling the bees\r\nwhen the hive is first opened, the smell will be almost certain to\r\nentice marauders from other hives to attempt to take possession of\r\ntreasures which do not belong to them, and when they once commence such\r\na pilfering course of life, they will be very loth to lay it aside. When\r\nthe honey harvest is abundant, (and this is the very time for forcing\r\nswarms,) bees, with proper precautions, are seldom inclined to rob. I\r\nhave sometimes found it difficult to induce them to notice honey-combs\r\nwhich I wished them to empty, even when they were placed in an exposed\r\nsituation. This subject, however, will be more fully treated in the\r\nremarks on Robbing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of my readers will hardly be able to convince themselves\r\nthat bees may be dealt with after the fashion I have been describing,\r\nwithout becoming greatly enraged; so far is this from being the case,\r\nthat in my operations, I often use neither sugar-water nor bee-dress,\r\nalthough I do not recommend the neglect of such precautions.\r\n\r\nThe artificial swarm may be created with perfect safety, even at\r\nmid-day, when thousands of bees are returning to the hive: for these\r\nbees being laden with honey, never venture upon making an attack, while\r\nthose at home may be easily pacified.\r\n\r\nI find a very great advantage in the peculiar shape of my hive, which\r\nallows the top to be easily removed, and the sugar-water to be sprinkled\r\nupon the bees, before they attempt to take wing. If like the Dzierzon\r\nhive, it opened on the end, it would be impossible for me to use the\r\nsweetened water, so as to make it run down between all the ranges of\r\ncomb, and I should be forced, as he does, to employ smoke, in all my\r\noperations. Huber thus speaks of the pacific effect produced upon the\r\nbees by the use of his leaf hive. \"On opening the hive, no stings are to\r\nbe dreaded, for one of the most singular and valuable properties\r\nattending my construction, is its rendering the bees tractable. I\r\nascribe their tranquility to the manner in which they are affected by\r\nthe sudden admission of light, they appear rather to testify fear than\r\nanger. Many retire, and entering the cells, seem to conceal themselves.\"\r\nI will admit that Huber has here fallen into an error which he would not\r\nhave made, had he used his own eyes. The bees do indeed enter the cells\r\nwhen the frames are exposed, but not \"to conceal themselves;\" they\r\nimagine that their sweets, thus unceremoniously exposed to the light of\r\nday, are to be taken from them, and they fill themselves to their utmost\r\ncapacity, in order to save all that they can. I always expect them to\r\nappropriate the contents of the open cells, as soon as I remove their\r\nframes from the hive. It is not merely the _sudden_ admission of light,\r\nbut its introduction from an _unexpected quarter_, that seems for the\r\ntime to disarm the hostility of the bees. They appear for a few moments,\r\nalmost as much confounded as we should be, if without any warning the\r\nroof and ceiling of a house should suddenly fly off into the air. Before\r\nthey recover from their amazement, the sweet libation is poured out upon\r\nthem, and surprize is quickly converted into pleasure rather than anger.\r\nI believe that in the working season, almost all the bees near the top\r\nare gorged with honey, and that this is the reason why opening the hive\r\nfrom ABOVE is so easily effected. The bees below that are disposed to\r\nresent any intrusions, are met in their threatening ascent, with an\r\navalanche of nectar which \"like a soft answer,\" most effectually\r\n\"turneth away wrath.\" Who would ever be willing to use the sickening\r\nfumes of the disgusting weed, when so much pleasure instead of pain may\r\nbe given to his bees. That bees never seem to be prepared to make an\r\ninstant assault from the top of their hive, but only near the entrance,\r\nany one may be convinced of, who will put my frames into a suspended\r\nhive with a movable bottom which may be made to drop at pleasure. If\r\nnow, for any purpose, he attempts to meddle with the combs from below,\r\nhe will find that unless he uses smoke, the bees will be almost, if not\r\nquite unmanageable.\r\n\r\nI shall now give some directions, which will greatly assist the Apiarian\r\nin his operations. He must bear in mind that nothing irritates bees more\r\nthan a sudden jar, and that this must, in all cases, be most carefully\r\navoided. The inside cover of the hive, or as I shall term it, the\r\n_honey-board_, because the surplus honey receptacles stand upon it, can\r\nnever be very firmly attached by the bees: it may always be readily\r\nloosened with a thin knife, or better still, with an apothecary's\r\nspatula, which will be very useful for many purposes in the Apiary. When\r\nthe honey-board is removed, its lower surface will be usually covered\r\nwith bees, and it should be carefully set on end, so as not to crush\r\nthem. There is not the least danger that one of them will offer to\r\nsting, as they are completely bewildered by the sudden introduction of\r\nlight, and their removal from the hive. As soon as the cover is disposed\r\nof, the Apiarian should sprinkle the bees with the sweet solution. This\r\nshould descend from the watering-pot in a fine stream, so as not to\r\n_drench_ the bees, and should fall upon the tops of the frames, as well\r\nas between the ranges of comb. The bees will at once, accept the\r\nproffered treat, and will begin lapping it up, as peaceably as so many\r\nchickens helping themselves to corn. While they are thus engaged, the\r\nframes must be very gently pried by a stick, from their attachments to\r\nthe rabbets on which they rest; this may be done without any jar and\r\nwithout wounding or enraging a single bee. They may all be loosened\r\npreparatory to removing them, in less than a minute.[17] By this time,\r\nthe sprinkled bees will have filled themselves, or if all have not done\r\nso, the grateful intelligence that sweets have been furnished them, will\r\ndiffuse an unusual good nature through all the honied realm. The\r\nApiarian should now remove one of the outside frames, taking hold of its\r\ntwo ends which rest upon the rabbets, and carefully lifting it out\r\nwithout inclining it from its perpendicular position, so as not to\r\ninjure a single bee. The removal of the next comb, and of all the\r\nsucceeding ones, will be more easily effected, as there will be more\r\nroom to operate to advantage. If bees were disposed to fly away at once\r\nfrom their combs, as soon as they were taken out, it would be very\r\ndifficult to manage them, but so far are they from doing this, that they\r\nadhere to them with most wonderful tenacity. I have sometimes removed\r\nall the combs, and arranged them in a continued line, and the bees have\r\nnot only refused to leave them, but have stoutly defended them against\r\nthe thieving propensities of other bees. By shaking off the bees from\r\nthe combs upon a sheet, and securing the queen, I can, on any pleasant\r\nday, exhibit nearly all the appearances of natural swarming. The bees,\r\nas soon as they miss their queen, will rise into the air, and by\r\nplacing her on the twig of a tree, they will soon cluster around her in\r\nthe manner already described.\r\n\r\nA word as to the manner of catching the queen. I seize her very gently,\r\nas I espy her among the bees, and by taking care to crush none of them,\r\nrun not the least risk of being stung. The queen herself never stings,\r\neven if handled ever so roughly.\r\n\r\nIn removing the frames from the hive, it will be found very convenient\r\nto have a box with suitable rabbets in which they may be temporarily\r\nput, and covered over with a piece of cotton cloth. They may thus be\r\nvery easily protected from the cold, and from robbing bees, if they are\r\nto be kept out of the hive for some time; and such a box will be very\r\nconvenient to receive frames that are lifted out for examination. In\r\nreturning the frames to a hive, care must be taken not to crush the bees\r\nwhere their ends rest upon the rabbets; they must be put in slowly, so\r\nthat a bee, when he feels the slightest pressure may have a chance to\r\ncreep from under them, before he is hurt.\r\n\r\nThe honey-cover, for convenience, is generally in two pieces: these\r\ncannot be laid down on the hive, without danger of killing many bees;\r\nthey are therefore very carefully _slid_ on, so that any bees which may\r\nbe in the way, are pushed before them, instead of being crushed. If any\r\nbees are upon such parts of the hive as to be imprisoned if the outside\r\ncover is closed, it should be left a little open, until they have flown\r\nto the entrance of the hive. It cannot be too deeply impressed upon the\r\nbee-keeper, that all his motions must be slow and gentle, and that the\r\nbees must not be injured or breathed upon. If he will carefully follow\r\nthe directions I have given, he may soon open a hundred hives and\r\nperform any necessary operation upon them, without any bee-dress, and\r\nyet with very little risk of being stung, but I almost despair of being\r\nable to convince even the most experienced Apiarians, of the ease and\r\nsafety with which bees may be managed on my plan, until they have\r\nactually been eye-witnesses of its successful operation.\r\n\r\nI can make an artificial colony in the way above described in ten\r\nminutes from the time that I open the hive, and if I see the queen as\r\nquickly as I often do, in not more than five minutes. Fifteen minutes\r\nwill be a very liberal allowance of time to complete the whole work. If\r\nI had an Apiary of a hundred colonies, in less than a week, if the\r\nweather was pleasant, I could without any assistance easily finish the\r\nbusiness of swarming for the whole season.\r\n\r\nBut how can the Apiarian, if he delays the formation of artificial\r\nswarms until nearly the season for natural swarming, be sure that his\r\nbees will not swarm in the usual way? Must he not still be constantly on\r\nhand, or run the risk of losing many of his best swarms? I come now to\r\nthe entirely novel plan by which such objections are completely\r\nobviated. If the Apiarian decides that he can most advantageously\r\nmultiply his colonies by artificial swarming, he must see that all his\r\nfertile queens are deprived of their wings, so as to be unable to lead\r\noff new swarms. As an old queen never leaves the hive except to\r\naccompany a new swarm, the loss of her wings does not, in the least\r\ninterfere with her usefulness, or with the attachment of the bees.\r\nOccasionally, a wingless queen is so bent on emigrating, that in spite\r\nof her inability to fly, she tries to go off with a swarm; she has \"a\r\nwill,\" but contrary to the old maxim she can find \"no way,\" but\r\nhelplessly falls upon the ground instead of gaily mounting into the air.\r\nIf the bees succeed in finding her, they will never desert her, but\r\ncluster directly around her, and may thus be easily secured by the\r\nApiarian. If she is not found, the bees will return to the parent stock\r\nto await the maturity of the young queens. The Apiarian will ordinarily\r\nbe prepared to form his artificial colonies before any of these young\r\nqueens are hatched.\r\n\r\nThe following is the best plan for removing the wings from the queens.\r\nEvery hive which contains a young queen, ought to be examined about a\r\nweek after she has hatched, (see Chapter on Loss of the Queen,) in order\r\nto ascertain that she has been impregnated, and has begun to lay eggs.\r\nSome of the central combs or those on which the bees are most thickly\r\nclustered, should be first lifted out, for she will almost always be\r\nfound on one of them; the Apiarian when he has caught her, should remove\r\nthe wings on one side with a pair of scissors taking care not to hurt\r\nher. On examining his hives next season, let him remove one of the two\r\nremaining wings from the queen. The third season, he may deprive her of\r\nher last wing. Bees always have four wings, a pair on each side. This\r\nplan saves him the trouble of marking his hives so as to know the age of\r\nthe queens they contain.\r\n\r\nAs the fertility of the queen generally decreases after the second year,\r\nI prefer, just before the drones are destroyed, to kill all the old\r\nqueens that have entered their third year. In this way, I guard against\r\nsome of my stocks becoming queenless, in consequence of the queen dying\r\nof old age, when there is no worker-brood in the hive, from which they\r\ncan rear another: or of having a worthless, drone-laying queen whose\r\nimpregnation has been retarded. These old queens are removed at that\r\nperiod of the year when their colony is strong in numbers; and as the\r\nhoney-harvest is by this time, nearly over, their removal is often a\r\npositive benefit, instead of a loss. The population is prevented from\r\nbeing over crowded at a time when the bees are consumers and not\r\nproducers, and when the young queen, reared in the place of the old one\r\nmatures, she will rapidly fill the cells with eggs, and raise a large\r\nnumber of bees to take advantage of the late honey-harvest, and to\r\nprepare the hive to winter most advantageously.\r\n\r\nThe certainty, rapidity and ease of making artificial swarms with my\r\nhives, will be such as to amaze those most who have had the greatest\r\nexperience and success in the management of bees. Instead of weeks\r\nwasted in watching the Apiary, in addition to all the other vexations\r\nand embarrassments which are so often found to attend reliance on\r\nnatural swarming, the Apiarian will find not only that he can create all\r\nhis new colonies in a very short time, but that he can, if he chooses,\r\nentirely prevent the issue of all after-swarms. In order to do this, he\r\nought to examine the stocks which are raising young queens, in season to\r\ncut out all the queen cells but one, before the larvæ come to maturity.\r\nIf he gave them a sealed queen nearly mature, they will raise no others,\r\nand no swarming, for that season, will take place. If the Apiarian\r\nwishes to do more than to double his stocks in one season, and is\r\nfavorably situated for practicing natural swarming, he can allow the\r\nstocks that raise young queens to swarm if they will, and he can\r\nstrengthen the small swarms by giving to them comb with honey and\r\nmaturing brood from other hives. Or he can, after an interval of about\r\nthree weeks, make one swarm from every two good ones in his Apiary, in a\r\nway that will soon be described.\r\n\r\nI do not know that I can find a better place in which to impress certain\r\nhighly important principles upon the attention of the bee-keeper. I am\r\nafraid, that in spite of all that I can say, many persons as soon as\r\nthey find themselves able to multiply colonies at pleasure, will so\r\noverdo the matter, as to run the risk of losing all their bees. If the\r\nApiarian aims at obtaining a large quantity of honey in any one season,\r\nhe cannot at the furthest, more than double the number of his stocks:\r\nnor can he do this, unless they are all strong, and the season\r\nfavorable. The moment that he aims, in any one season, at a more rapid\r\nincrease, he must not only renounce the idea of having any surplus\r\nhoney, but must expect to purchase food for the support of his colonies,\r\nunless he is willing to see them all perish by starvation. The time,\r\nfood, care and skill required to multiply stocks with very great\r\nrapidity, in our short and uncertain climate, are so great that not one\r\nApiarian in a hundred can expect to make it profitable; while the great\r\nmass of those who attempt it, will be almost sure, at the close of the\r\nseason, to find themselves in possession of stocks which have been so\r\nmanaged as to be of very little value.\r\n\r\nBefore explaining some other methods of artificial swarming, which I\r\nhave employed to great advantage, I shall endeavor to impress upon the\r\nmind of the bee-keeper, the great importance of thoroughly understanding\r\neach season, the precise object at which he is aiming, before he enters\r\non the work of increasing his colonies. If his object is, in any one\r\nseason, to get the largest yield of surplus honey, he must at once make\r\nup his mind to be content with a very moderate increase of stocks. If,\r\non the contrary, he desires to multiply his colonies, say, three or four\r\nfold, he must be prepared, not only to relinquish the expectation of\r\nobtaining any surplus honey, if the season should prove unfavorable, but\r\nto purchase food for the support of his bees. Rapid multiplication of\r\ncolonies, and large harvests of surplus honey cannot, in the very nature\r\nof things, be secure in our climate, in any one season.\r\n\r\nIf the number of colonies is to be increased to a large extent, then the\r\nbees in the Apiary will be tasked to the utmost in building new comb,\r\nas well as in rearing brood. For these purposes, they must consume the\r\nsupply of honey which, under other circumstances, they would have stored\r\nup, a part for their own use in the main hive, and the balance for their\r\nowner, in the spare honey-boxes.\r\n\r\nTo make this matter perfectly plain, let us suppose a colony to swarm.\r\nIf the new hive, into which the swarm is put, holds, as it ought, about\r\na bushel, it will require about two pounds of wax to fill it with comb,\r\nand at least forty pounds of honey will be used in its manufacture! If\r\nthe season is favorable, and the swarm was large and early, they may\r\ngather, not only enough to build this comb and to store it with honey\r\nsufficient for their own use, but a number of pounds in addition, for\r\nthe benefit of their owner. If the old stock does not swarm again, it\r\nwill rapidly replenish its numbers, and as it has no new comb to build\r\nin the main hive which already contains much honey, it will be able to\r\nstore up a generous allowance in the upper boxes. These favorable\r\nresults are all on the supposition that the season was ordinarily\r\nproductive in honey, and that the hive was so powerful in numbers as to\r\nbe able to swarm early. If the season should prove to be very\r\nunfavorable, the first swarm cannot be expected to gather more than\r\nenough for its own use, while the parent stock will yield only a small\r\nreturn. The profits of the bee-keeper, in such an unfortunate season,\r\nwill be mainly in the increase of his stocks. If the swarm was late, in\r\nconsequence of the stock being weak in Spring, the early part of the\r\nhoney-harvest will pass away, and the bees will be able to obtain from\r\nit, but a small share of honey. During all this time of comparative\r\ninactivity, the orchards may present\r\n\r\n    \"One boundless blush, one white empurpled shower\r\n    Of mingled blossoms,\"\r\n\r\nand tens of thousands of bees from stronger stocks, may be engaged all\r\nday, in sipping the fragrant sweets, so that every gale which \"fans its\r\nodoriferous wings\" about their dwellings, dispenses\r\n\r\n    \"Native perfumes, and whispers whence they stole[18]\r\n    Those balmy spoils.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time that the feeble stock is prepared to swarm, if it swarm at\r\nall that season, the honey-harvest is almost over, and the new colony\r\nwill seldom be able to gather enough for its own use, so that unless\r\nfed, it must perish the succeeding Winter. Bee-keeping with colonies\r\nfeeble in the Spring, is most emphatically nothing but \"folly and\r\nvexation of spirit.\"\r\n\r\nI have shown how the bee-keeper, with a strong stock-hive which has\r\nswarmed early and but once, may in a favorable season realize handsome\r\nprofits from his bees. If the parent stock throws a second swarm, then,\r\nas a general rule, unless this swarm was very early, and the honey\r\nseason good, if managed on the ordinary plan, it will seldom prove of\r\nany value. It will almost always perish in the Winter, if it does not\r\ndesert its hive in the Fall, and the family from which it issued, will\r\nnot only gather no surplus honey, (unless it was secured before the\r\nfirst swarm issued,) but will very often perish likewise. Thus the\r\ninexperienced owner who was so delighted with the rapid increase of his\r\ncolonies, begins the next season with no more colonies than he had the\r\nyear before, and has very often lost all the time he has bestowed upon\r\nhis bees. I can, to be sure, on my plan, prevent the death of the bees,\r\nand can build up all the feeble colonies, so as to make them strong and\r\npowerful: but only by giving up all idea of obtaining a single pound of\r\nhoney. From the first swarm, I must take combs containing maturing\r\nbrood, to strengthen my weak swarms, and this first swarm however\r\npowerful or early, instead of being able to store its combs with honey,\r\nwill be constantly tasked in building new combs to replace those taken\r\naway, so that when the honey harvest closes, it will have scarcely any\r\nhoney, and must be fed to prevent it from starving. Any man who has\r\nsense enough to be entrusted with bees, can, from these remarks,\r\nunderstand exactly why it is impossible to multiply colonies rapidly in\r\nany one season, and yet obtain from them large supplies of honey. Even\r\nthe doubling of stocks in one season, will very often be too rapid an\r\nincrease, if the greatest quantity of spare honey is to be obtained from\r\nthem; and when the largest yield of honey is desired, I much prefer to\r\nform, in a way soon to be described, only one new stock from two old\r\nones; this will give even more from the three, than could have been\r\nobtained from the two, on the ordinary non-swarming plan.\r\n\r\nI would very strongly dissuade any but experienced Apiarians, from\r\nattempting at the furthest, to do more than to triple their stocks in\r\none year. In order to furnish directions for very rapid multiplication,\r\nsufficiently full and explicit to be of any value to the inexperienced,\r\nI should have to write a book on this one topic; and even then, the most\r\nof those who should undertake it, would be sure at first to fail.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that with ten strong stocks of bees in a good location,\r\nin one favorable season, I could so increase them as to have, on the\r\napproach of Winter, one hundred good colonies: but I should expect to\r\nfeed hundreds of pounds of honey, to devote nearly all my time to their\r\nmanagement, and to bring to the work, the experience of many years, and\r\nthe wisdom acquired by numerous failures. After all, what we most need,\r\nin order to be successful in the cultivation of bees, is a _certain_,\r\nrather than a _rapid_ multiplication of stocks. It would require but a\r\nvery few years to stock our whole country with bees, if colonies could\r\nonly be doubled annually; and an increase of even one third, would\r\nbefore long, give us bees enough. This rate of increase I should always\r\nencourage in the swarming season, even if, in the Fall, I reduced my\r\nstocks (see Union of Stocks) to the Spring number. In the long run, it\r\nwill keep the colonies in a much more prosperous condition, and secure\r\nfrom them the largest yield of honey.\r\n\r\nI have never myself hesitated to sacrifice one or more colonies, in\r\norder to ascertain a single fact, and it would require a separate volume\r\nquite as large as this, to detail the various experiments which I have\r\nmade on the subject of Artificial Swarming. The practical bee-keeper,\r\nhowever, should never, for a moment, lose sight of the important\r\ndistinction between an Apiary managed principally for the purposes of\r\nexperiment and discovery, and one conducted almost exclusively with\r\nreference to pecuniary profit. Any bee-keeper can easily experiment with\r\nmy hives: but I would recommend him to do so, at first, on a small\r\nscale, and if profit is his object, to follow the directions furnished\r\nin this treatise, until he is _sure_ that he has discovered others which\r\nare preferable. These cautions are given to prevent persons from\r\nincurring serious losses and disappointments, if they use hives which,\r\nif they are not on their guard, may tempt them into rash and\r\nunprofitable courses, by allowing so easily of all manner of\r\nexperiments. Let the practical Apiarian remember that the less he\r\ndisturbs the stocks on which he relies for surplus honey, the better.\r\nAfter they are properly lodged in their new hive, they ought by all\r\nmeans to be allowed to carry on their labors without any interruption.\r\nThe object of giving the control over every comb in the hive, is not to\r\nenable him to be incessantly taking them in and out, and subjecting the\r\nbees to all sorts of annoyances. Unless he is conducting a course of\r\nexperiments, such interference will be almost as silly as the conduct of\r\nchildren who pull up the seeds which they have planted, to see whether\r\nthey have sprouted, or how much they have grown. If after these\r\ncautions, any still choose to disregard them, the blame of their losses\r\nwill fall, not upon the hive, but upon their own mismanagement.\r\n\r\nLet me not, for a moment, be understood as wishing to discourage\r\ninvestigation, or to intimate that perfection has been so nearly\r\nattained that no more important discoveries remain to be made. On the\r\ncontrary, I should be glad to learn that many who have the time and\r\nmeans, are disposed to use the facilities furnished by hives which give\r\nthe control of each comb, to experiment on a large scale; and I hope\r\nthat every intelligent bee-keeper who follows my plans, will experiment\r\nat least on a small scale. In this way, we may soon expect to see, more\r\nsatisfactorily elucidated, some points in the Natural History of the\r\nbee, which are still involved in doubt.\r\n\r\nHaving described the way in which forced swarms are made, both in common\r\nhives and in my own, when the Apiarian wishes in one season merely to\r\ndouble his colonies, I shall now show in what way he can secure the\r\nlargest yield of honey, by forming only one new colony from two old\r\nones.\r\n\r\nEarly in the season, before the bees fly out, or better still, after\r\nthey ceased to fly in the previous Fall, the two hives from which the\r\nnew colony is to be formed, should be placed near each other, unless\r\nthey are already, not more than a foot apart. When the time for forming\r\nthe artificial colony has arrived, these hives should be removed from\r\ntheir stand, and the bees driven from them, precisely in the manner\r\nalready described. If all the bees are at home, I sometimes shut up the\r\nhives on their stand, and drum long enough to cause the bees to fill\r\nthemselves before the hive is removed. Timid Apiarians may find some\r\nadvantage in this course, as the bees will all be quiet after they are\r\nwell drummed, and the hive may then be removed with greater safety. In\r\nfive minutes I can in this way reduce any swarm to a peaceable\r\ncondition. After the forced swarms are secured, the removed hives are\r\nreplaced, in order to catch up all the returning bees, and the forced\r\nswarms must be shut up, until towards sunset; unless it is judged best\r\nto keep the entrances temporarily open, so as to secure the return of a\r\nsufficient number of bees to the parent stocks. The old stocks are now\r\nmoved to a new place, and managed according to the previous directions.\r\nIf neither of the expelled swarms was driven into the hive intended for\r\nthe new colony, then the proper hive must be placed, as near as\r\npossible, in the center of the space previously occupied by the original\r\ncolonies. One of the swarms must now be shaken out upon a sheet, in\r\nfront of this hive which should be elevated, so as to enable the bees to\r\nenter it readily. As soon as they are shaken out, they should be gently\r\nsprinkled with sugar-water scented with peppermint, or any other\r\nfragrant odor. Diligent search must now be made for the Queen, and if\r\nfound, she should be carefully removed, and given to the hive to which\r\nshe belongs. If the queen of the first swarm has been found, the second\r\ncolony may be shaken out, and sprinkled in the same way, and allowed to\r\nenter without any further trouble. If the queen of the first colony was\r\nnot found, then that of the second one must be sought for; if neither\r\ncan be found, (though this, after a little experience, will very seldom\r\nhappen,) one of the Queens will soon kill the other, and reign over the\r\nunited family. The next day, the doubled colony will be found working\r\nwith amazing vigor, and it will not only fill its main hive, but will,\r\nin any ordinary season, gather large quantities of surplus honey\r\nbesides.\r\n\r\nThe Apiarian who relies upon natural swarming, can double his new\r\ncolonies if they issue at the same time, by hiving them together, or if\r\nthis cannot be done, he may hive them in separate hives, and then,\r\ntowards evening, set one hive on a sheet, and shake down the bees from\r\nthe other, so that they can enter and join the first. It may be safely\r\ndone, even if several days have elapsed before the second colony swarms;\r\nalthough in this case, I prefer after turning up their hive to sprinkle\r\nthe oldest swarm with scented sugar-water, and then to give the new\r\nswarm the same treatment. I have doubled natural swarms in this way,\r\nrepeatedly, and have never, when they were early, failed to secure from\r\nthem a large quantity of honey. In sprinkling bees, let the operator\r\nremember that they are not to be _drenched_, or almost drowned, as in\r\nthis case, they will require a long time to enter the hive. Bees seem to\r\nrecognize each other by the sense of smell; and when they are made to\r\nhave the same odor, they will always mingle peaceably. This is the\r\nreason why I use a few drops of peppermint in the sugar-water.\r\n\r\nIf one of the queens of the forced swarms can be returned to her own\r\ncolony, it will of course, save them the time which would otherwise be\r\nlost in raising another. I do not know that I can better illustrate the\r\nimportance of the inexperienced Apiarian following carefully my\r\ndirections, than by supposing him to return the queen to the colony to\r\nwhich she does not belong. Now I can easily imagine that some bee-keeper\r\nmay do so, conceiving that I am foolishly precise in my directions, and\r\nthat the queen might be just as well given to one hive as to the other.\r\nBut if this is done before at least 24 hours have elapsed since they\r\nwere deprived of their own, she will almost certainly be destroyed. The\r\nbees do not _sting_ a queen to death, but have a curious mode of\r\ncrowding or knotting around her, so that she is soon smothered; and\r\nwhile thus imprisoned, she will often make the same piping note which\r\nhas already been described. In all this treatise, I have constantly\r\naimed to give no directions which are not important; and while I utterly\r\nrepudiate the notion that these directions may not be modified and\r\nimproved, I am quite certain that this cannot be done by any but those\r\nwho have considerable experience in the management of bees.\r\n\r\nThe formation of one new swarm from two old colonies, may, of course, be\r\nvery much simplified by the use of my hives. The two old hives are first\r\nopened and sprinkled, and the bees taken from them and put into the new\r\nhive in the same way in which the process was conducted when only one\r\ncolony was expelled, some brood comb being given to the united family.\r\nThere will be no difficulty in rightly proportioning the bees; one queen\r\nmay always be caught and preserved, and the operation may be performed\r\nat any time when the sun is above the horizon. I have no doubt that\r\nthose who have a strong stock of bees, and who are anxious to realize\r\nthe largest profits in honey, will find this mode of increase, by far\r\nthe simplest and best. If judiciously practiced, they will find that\r\ntheir colonies may always be kept powerful, and that they may be managed\r\nwith very great economy in time and labor. As Apiarians may be so\r\nsituated as to wish to increase their bees quite rapidly, I shall give\r\nsuch methods as from numerous experiments, many of them conducted on a\r\nlarge scale, I have found to be the best. I wish it however to be most\r\ndistinctly understood, that I do not consider _very_ rapid\r\nmultiplication as likely to succeed, except in the hands of skillful\r\nApiarians; and under ordinary circumstances it requires too much time,\r\ncare and honey, to be of very great practical value. Its chief merit\r\nconsists in the short time which it requires to build up an Apiary.\r\nAfter trying my mode of management for a few seasons, a bee-keeper may\r\nfind out, that he is in all respects, favorably situated for taking care\r\nof a large stock of bees. Suppose him to have acquired both skill and\r\nconfidence, and that he has ten powerful colonies. If he is willing to\r\ndo without surplus honey for one season, and the honey-harvest should be\r\nvery productive, he may without feeding, and without very much labor,\r\nsafely increase his ten colonies to thirty. If he chooses to feed\r\nlargely, he may _possibly_ end the season with fifty or sixty, or even\r\nmore; but he will _probably_ end it in such a manner as most thoroughly\r\nto disgust him with his folly, and to teach him that in bee-keeping, as\r\nwell as in other things, \"Haste makes waste.\"\r\n\r\nOn the supposition that by the time the fruit-trees are in blossom, the\r\nApiarian has, in hives of my construction, ten powerful colonies, let\r\nhim select four of the strongest, and make from each a forced swarm. He\r\nwill now have four queenless colonies, which will at once, proceed to\r\nsupply themselves with a young queen. In about ten days, he may make\r\nfrom his other six stocks, six more forced swarms. He will probably find\r\nin making these, many sealed queens, if he has delayed the operation\r\nuntil about swarming time; so that he may give to each of the six stocks\r\nfrom which he has expelled a swarm, the means of soon obtaining\r\nanother. If he has not enough for this purpose, he must take the\r\nrequired number from the four stocks which are raising young queens, the\r\nexact condition of which ought to have been previously ascertained. Some\r\nof these stocks will be found to contain a large number of queen cells.\r\nHuber, in one of his experiments, found twenty-four in one hive, and\r\neven a larger number has sometimes been reared by a single colony. As\r\nthe Apiarian will always have many more queens than are wanted, he ought\r\nto select those combs which contain a sealed queen, so as to secure say,\r\nabout fifteen combs, each of which has one or more queens. If necessary,\r\nhe can cut out some of the cells, and adjust them in the manner\r\npreviously described. Each comb containing a sealed queen must be put\r\nwith all the bees adhering to it, into an empty hive; and by a divider,\r\nor movable partition, they must be confined to about one quarter of the\r\nhive; water should be given to them, and honey, if none is contained in\r\nthe comb. I always prefer to select a comb which contains a large number\r\nof workers almost mature, and some of which are just beginning to hatch,\r\nso that even if a considerable number of the bees should return to the\r\nparent stock, after their liberty is given them, there will still be a\r\nsufficient number hatched, to attend to the young, and especially to\r\nwatch over the maturing queens. If the comb contains a large number of\r\nbees just emerging from their cells, I prefer to confine them only one\r\nday, otherwise I keep them shut up until about an hour before sunset of\r\nthe third day. The hives containing the small colonies, ought, if they\r\nare not well protected by being made double, to be set where they are\r\nthoroughly sheltered from the intense heat of the sun; and the\r\nventilators should give them an abundance of air. They should also be\r\nclosed in such a manner, as to keep the interior in entire darkness, so\r\nthat the bees may not become too uneasy during their confinement. I\r\naccomplish this by shutting up their entrance, and replacing their front\r\nboard, just as though I were intending to put them into winter quarters.\r\n\r\nThese small colonies I shall call _nuclei_, and the system of forming\r\nstocks from them, my nucleus system; and before I describe this system\r\nmore particularly, I shall show other ways in which the nuclei can be\r\nformed. If the Apiarian chooses, he can take a frame containing bees\r\njust ready to mature, and eggs and young worms, all of the worker kind,\r\ntogether with the old bees which cluster on it, and shut them up in the\r\nmanner previously described; even if he has no sealed queen to give\r\nthem. If all things are favorable, they will set about raising a queen\r\nin a few hours. I once took not more than a tea-cup full of bees and\r\nconfined them with a small piece of brood comb in a dark place, and\r\nfound that in about an hour's time, they had begun to enlarge some of\r\nthe cells, to raise a new queen! If the Apiarian has sealed queens on\r\nhand, they ought, by all means, to be given to the nuclei, in order to\r\nsave all the time possible.\r\n\r\nI sometimes make these nuclei as follows. The suitable comb with bees\r\n&c., is taken from a stock-hive, and set in an empty one, made to stand\r\npartly in the place of the old hive, which, of course, must previously\r\nbe moved a little on one side. In this way, I am able to direct a\r\nconsiderable number of the bees from the old stock to my nucleus, and\r\nthe necessity of shutting it up, is done away with. If the bees from the\r\nold stock do not enter the small one, in sufficient numbers, I sometimes\r\nclose their hive, so that the returning bees can find no other place to\r\nenter. My object is not to catch up a _large_ number of bees. For\r\nreasons previously assigned, I do not want enough to build new comb, but\r\nonly enough to adhere to the removed comb, and raise a new queen from\r\nthe brood, or develop the sealed one which has been given them. A short\r\ntime after one nucleus has in this way, been formed, another may be made\r\nby moving the old hive again, and so a third or fourth, if so many are\r\nwanted. This plan requires considerable skill and experience, to secure\r\nthe right number of bees, without getting too many.\r\n\r\nIf bees are to be made to enter a new hive, by removing the old one from\r\nits stand, it will always be very desirable not only to have the new one\r\ncontain a piece of comb, but a considerable number of bees _clustered_\r\non that comb. I repeatedly found my bees, after entering the hive,\r\nrefuse to have anything to do with the brood comb, and for a long time,\r\nI was unable to conjecture the cause; until I ascertained that they were\r\ndissatisfied with its deserted appearance, and that, by taking the\r\nprecaution to have it well covered with bees, I seldom failed to\r\nreconcile them to my system of forced colonization. I can usually tell,\r\nin less than two minutes, whether the operation will succeed or not. If\r\nthe returning bees are content, they will, however much agitated at\r\nfirst, soon begin to join the cluster on the comb; while if they are\r\ndissatisfied, they will abandon the hive, and nearly all the bees that\r\nwere originally on the comb, will leave with them. They seem capricious\r\nin this matter, and are sometimes so very self-willed, that they refuse\r\nto have anything to do with the brood comb, when I can see no good\r\nreason why they should be so rebellious.\r\n\r\nI shall here state some _conjectures_ which have occurred to me on this\r\nsubject. Is it absolutely certain that bees can raise a queen from _any_\r\negg or young larva which would produce a worker? Or if this is possible,\r\nis it certain that _any kind of workers_ can accomplish this? Huber\r\nascertained to his own satisfaction that there were two kinds of workers\r\nin a hive. He thus describes them.\r\n\r\n\"One of these is, in general, destined for the elaboration of wax, and\r\nits size is considerably enlarged when full of honey; the other\r\nimmediately imparts what it has collected to its companions, its abdomen\r\nundergoes no sensible change, or it retains only the honey necessary for\r\nits own subsistence. The particular function of the bees of this kind is\r\nto take care of the young, for they are not charged with provisioning\r\nthe hive. In opposition to the wax workers, we shall call them small\r\nbees or nurses.\"\r\n\r\n\"Although the external difference be inconsiderable, this is not an\r\nimaginary distinction. Anatomical observations prove that the capacity\r\nof the stomach is not the same--experiments have ascertained that one of\r\nthe species cannot fulfil all the functions shared among the workers of\r\na hive. We painted those of each class with different colors, in order\r\nto study their proceedings; and these were not interchanged. In another\r\nexperiment, after supplying a hive deprived of a queen with brood and\r\npollen, we saw the small bees quickly occupied in nutrition of the\r\nlarvæ, while those of the wax working class neglected them. Small bees\r\nalso produce wax, but in a very inferior quantity to what is elaborated\r\nby the real wax workers.\"\r\n\r\nNow if these statements can be relied on, and thus far I have nearly\r\nalways found Huber's statements, where-ever I had an opportunity to test\r\nthem, to be most wonderfully reliable, then it may be that when bees\r\nrefuse to cluster on the brood comb and to proceed at once to rear a new\r\nqueen, it is because they find that some of the conditions necessary for\r\nsuccess are wanting. Either there may not be a sufficient number of\r\nwax-workers, to enlarge the cells, or a sufficient number of nurses to\r\ntake charge of the larvæ; or it may be that the cells contain only young\r\nwax-workers which cannot be developed into queens, or only young\r\nnurses, which may be in the same predicament.\r\n\r\nIf any of my readers imagine that the work of carefully experimenting,\r\nin order to establish facts upon the solid basis of complete\r\ndemonstration, is an easy work, let them attempt now to prove or\r\ndisprove the truth of any or all of my conjectures upon this single\r\ntopic. They will probably find the task more difficult than to blot over\r\nwhole quires and reams of paper with careless assertions.\r\n\r\nAll operations of any kind which interfere in the very least, with the\r\nnatural mode of forming colonies, are best performed in the swarming\r\nseason: or at least, at a time when the bees are breeding freely, and\r\nare able to bring in large stores of honey from the fields. At other\r\ntimes, they are very precarious, and unless under the management of\r\npersons who have great experience, they will in most cases, end in\r\nnothing but vexatious losses and disappointments.\r\n\r\nIt is quite amusing to see how bees act, when they find, on their return\r\nfrom foraging abroad, that their hive has been moved, and another put in\r\nits place. If the new hive is precisely similar to their own, in size\r\nand outward appearance, they enter it as though all was right; but in a\r\nfew moments, they rush out in violent agitation, imagining that they\r\nhave made a prodigious mistake and have entered the wrong place. They\r\nnow take wing again in order to correct their blunder, but find to their\r\nincreasing surprise, that they had previously directed their flight to\r\nthe familiar spot; again they enter, and again they tumble out, in\r\nbewildered crowds, until, at length, if they can find the means of\r\nraising a new queen, or one is already there, they seem to make up their\r\nminds that if this is not home, it not only looks like it, but stands\r\njust where their home ought to be, and is at all events the only home\r\nthey are likely to get. No doubt they often feel that a very hard\r\nbargain has been imposed upon them, but they seem generally determined\r\nto make the best of it.\r\n\r\nThere is one trait in the character of bees, for which I feel, not\r\nmerely admiration, but the most profound respect. Such is their\r\nindomitable energy and perseverance, that under circumstances apparently\r\nthe most despairing, they will still labor to the utmost, to retrieve\r\ntheir losses, and sustain the sinking state. So long as they have a\r\nqueen, or any prospect of raising one, they struggle most vigorously\r\nagainst impending ruin, and never give up, unless their condition is\r\nabsolutely desperate. In one of my observing hives, I once had a colony\r\nof bees, the whole of which might have been spread out on my two hands,\r\nbusy at work in raising a new queen, from a small piece of brood comb.\r\nFor two long weeks, they adhered with unfailing perseverance and\r\nindustry, to their forlorn hope: until at last, one of the two queens\r\nwhich they raised, came forth, and destroyed the other while still in\r\nher cell. The bees had now dwindled away to less than half their\r\noriginal number, and the new queen had wings so imperfect that she was\r\nunable to fly. I watched their proceedings with great interest; they\r\nactually paid very unusual attention to this crippled queen, and treated\r\nher more as they are wont to treat a fertile one. In the course of a\r\nweek, there were not more than a dozen left in the hive, and in a few\r\ndays more, I missed the queen, and saw only a few disconsolate wretches\r\ncrawling over the deserted comb! Shame upon the faint-hearted and\r\ncowardly of our own race, who, if overtaken by calamity, instead of\r\nnobly breasting the dark waters of affliction, and manfully buffetting\r\nwith their tumultuous waves, meanly resign themselves to their ignoble\r\nfate, and sink and perish where they might have lived and triumphed; and\r\ndouble shame upon those who thus \"faint in the day of adversity,\" when\r\nliving in a Christian land, they might, if they would only receive the\r\nword of God, and open the eye of faith, behold a bow of promise spanning\r\nthe still stormy clouds, and hear a voice bidding them, like the great\r\napostle of the Gentiles, learn not merely to \"rejoice in hope of the\r\nglory of God,\" but to \"glory in tribulations also.\"\r\n\r\nI have been informed by Mr. Wagner, that Dzierzon has recently devised a\r\nplan of _forming nuclei_, substantially the same with my own. His book,\r\nhowever, contemplates having two Apiaries, three or four miles apart,\r\nand his plans for multiplying colonies, as there described, were based\r\nupon the supposition that the Apiarian will have two such\r\nestablishments. Such an arrangement would no doubt very greatly\r\nfacilitate many operations. Our forced swarms might all be removed from\r\nthe Apiary where they were formed, to the other, and our nuclei treated\r\nin the same way, and there would be no necessity for confining the bees\r\nafter their removal. There are however, weighty objections to such an\r\narrangement, which will prevent it, at least for some time, from being\r\nextensively adopted. The labor of removing the bees backwards and\r\nforwards, is a serious objection to the whole plan; and in addition to\r\nthis, the necessity of having a skillful Apiarian at each establishment,\r\nputs its adoption out of the question, with most persons who keep bees.\r\nIt might answer, however, if two bee-keepers, sufficiently far apart,\r\nwould enter into partnership, and manage their bees as a joint concern.\r\nDzierzon's new plan of creating nuclei, is as follows. Towards evening,\r\nremove a piece of brood comb, with eggs and bees just hatching, and put\r\nit, with a sufficient number of mature bees, into an empty hive; there\r\nmust be enough to keep the brood from being chilled over night. If the\r\noperation is performed so late that the bees are not disposed to take\r\nwing and leave the hive, by morning a sufficient number will have\r\nhatched, to supply the place of those which may abandon the nucleus. In\r\nmy numerous experiments last Summer, in the formation of artificial\r\nswarms, I tried this plan and found that it answered a good purpose; the\r\nchief objection to it, is the difficulty often of selecting the suitable\r\nkind of comb, if the operation is delayed until late in the afternoon. I\r\nprefer, therefore, to perform it, when the sun is an hour or two high,\r\nand to confine the bees until dark. If there are not a sufficient number\r\nof bees on the comb, I shake off some from another frame, directly into\r\nthe hive, and shut them all up, giving them a supply of water. Sealed\r\nqueens if possible, should be used in all these operations.\r\n\r\nI shall now give a novel mode of creating nuclei, which I have devised,\r\nand which I find to be attended with great success. Hive a new swarm in\r\nthe usual manner, in an old box, and as soon as the bees have entered\r\nit, shut them up and carry them down into the cellar. About an hour\r\nbefore sunset, take combs suitable to form as many nuclei as you judge\r\nbest, say five or six, or even eight or ten if the swarm was large, and\r\nyou need as many. Bring up the new swarm and shake it out upon a sheet,\r\nsprinkling it gently with sugar-water. With a large tumbler or saucer,\r\nscoop up without hurting any of the bees, a pint or more of them, and\r\nplace them before the mouth of one of the hives containing a brood comb;\r\nrepeat the process, until each nucleus has, say, a quart of bees. If you\r\nsee the queen, you may give the hive in which you put her, three or four\r\ntimes as many bees as any other; and the next day it may be strengthened\r\nwith a few combs containing brood, just ready to mature. If you did not\r\nfind her, at the time of forming the nuclei, when you afterwards examine\r\nthem, the one which contains her may be properly reinforced with bees\r\nand comb, so as to enable it to work to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nIf this plan of forming nuclei, were attempted earlier in the afternoon\r\nit would be difficult to prevent the bees from communicating on the\r\nwing, and all going to the hive which contained their queen. If however,\r\nthe bees when first shaken out of the temporary hive, are so thoroughly\r\nsprinkled, as not to be able to take wing and unite together, this mode\r\nof forming colonies may be practiced at any hour of the day; and an\r\nexperienced Apiarian may prefer to do it, as soon as he has fairly hived\r\nthe new swarm. When the bees are shaken out in front of a hive which has\r\na sealed queen, or eggs from which they can raise one, having a whole\r\nnight in which to accustom themselves to their new situation, they will\r\nbe found, the next day, to adhere to the place where they were put, with\r\nas much tenacity as a natural swarm does to their new hive. How\r\nwonderful that the act of swarming should so thoroughly impress upon the\r\nbees, an absolute indisposition to return to the parent stock. If this\r\nwere a fixed and invariable unwillingness, a sort of blind, unreasoning\r\ninstinct, it would not be so surprising, but we have already seen that\r\nin case the bees lose their queen, they return in a very short time to\r\nthe stock from which they issued! If the nuclei formed in the manner\r\njust described, found in their new hive, no means of obtaining a queen,\r\nthey would all return, next morning, to the parent stock.\r\n\r\nWhen the Apiarian can obtain a natural swarm from any other Apiary, it\r\nmay be divided into nuclei in the same way, and even a forced swarm, if\r\nbrought from a distance, will answer equally well. If the Apiarian\r\nwishes to form colonies earlier than the season of natural swarming, and\r\ncannot conveniently obtain a forced swarm from an Apiary, at least a\r\nmile distant, he may, before the bees begin to fly out in the Spring,\r\ntransport one of his stocks to a neighbor's, and force from it a swarm\r\nat the desired time. Even if it is moved not more than half a mile off,\r\nthe operation will be almost sure to succeed. Of all modes of forming\r\nthe nuclei, this I believe will be found to be the neatest, simplest and\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nHaving thus described the various ways in which I have successfully\r\nformed my nuclei, I shall now show how they may be all built up into\r\npowerful stocks. It will be very obvious that on the ordinary plan of\r\nmanagement, they would be absolutely worthless, even if it were possible\r\nto form them with the common hives. If they were not fed, they would be\r\nunable to collect the means of building new comb, and would gradually\r\ndwindle away, just as third or fourth swarms which issue late in the\r\nseason; nor could they be saved even by the most generous feeding, as\r\nthey would only use their supplies to fill up the little comb they had;\r\nso that when the queen was ready to lay, there would be no empty cells\r\nto receive her eggs, and too few bees to build any, even if they had all\r\nthe honey that they required. Such small colonies must gradually waste\r\naway, unless they can be speedily and effectually supplied with the\r\nrequisite number of bees, and this can be done only by hives which give\r\nthe control of all the combs. With such hives, I can speedily build up\r\nmy nuclei, (provided I have not formed too many,) to the strength\r\nnecessary to make them powerful stocks. The hives containing them, ought\r\nif possible, to stand at some distance from other hives, say two or\r\nthree feet: and if this cannot conveniently be done, they should in some\r\nway, be so distinguished from the adjoining hives, that the young queens\r\nwhen they are hatched and go out to seek the drones, will not be liable\r\nto lose their lives by entering a wrong hive on their return. A small\r\nleafy twig fastened on the alighting board of such hives, when they\r\nstand near to others, will be almost sure to prevent such a\r\ncatastrophe: if they stand near to each other, some may be marked in\r\nthis way, and others with a piece of colored cloth. (See Page 159.) To\r\nguard them against robbers, &c., the entrances to these nuclei should be\r\ncontracted, so that only a few bees can enter at once. Those which were\r\nconfined, should be examined, the day after their liberty is given to\r\nthem; the others, the day after they were formed, when, if they were not\r\nsupplied with a sealed queen, they will be found actively engaged in\r\nconstructing royal cells. A new range of comb should now be given to\r\neach one, and it should contain no old bees, but brood rapidly maturing,\r\nand if possible, eggs and worms only a few days old.\r\n\r\nThis new addition of strength will greatly encourage the nuclei, and\r\ngive them the means of starting young queens, if they have not succeeded\r\nin doing so with the first comb. I have very frequently found that for\r\nsome cause which I have not yet ascertained, they often start a large\r\nnumber of queen cells, which in a few days, are all discontinued and\r\nuntenanted. The second attempt seldom fails. Does practice in this thing\r\nmake them more expert? But I will simply state the fact, referring to my\r\nconjectures on page 218; and remarking that when they make a second\r\nattempt, they seem frequently disposed to start a much larger number\r\nthan they otherwise would have done. In two or three days after giving\r\nthem the first piece of comb, I give them another, if their queen is\r\nnearly mature, and I now let them alone until she ought to be depositing\r\neggs in the hive. I then give them, at intervals of a few days, two or\r\nthree combs more, and they will now be sufficiently powerful in bees, to\r\ngather large quantities of honey, and fill the empty part of their hive.\r\nThe young queen is supplying with thousands of worker-eggs, the cells\r\nfrom which the brood has emerged, and also the new ones built by the\r\nbees, and the new colony will soon be one of the best stock hives in\r\nthe Apiary. If some of the full frames are moved, and empty ones placed\r\nbetween them, as soon as the bees begin to build powerfully, there need\r\nbe no guide combs on the empty frames, and still the work will be\r\nexecuted with the most beautiful regularity.\r\n\r\nBut what, in the mean time, is the condition of the hives from which we\r\nare taking so many brood combs for the proper development of our nuclei;\r\nare they not weakened so much as to become quite enfeebled? I come now\r\nto the very turning point of the whole nucleus system. If due judgment\r\nhas not been used, and the sanguine bee-keeper has endeavored to\r\nmultiply his colonies too rapidly, a most grievous disappointment awaits\r\nhim. Either his nuclei cannot be strengthened at the right time, or this\r\ncan be done, only by impoverishing the old stocks, and the result of the\r\nwhole operation will be a most decided failure, and if he is in the\r\nvicinity of sugar-houses, confectionaries, or other tempting places of\r\nbee resort, he will find the population of his colonies very seriously\r\ndiminished, and will have to break up the most of the nuclei which he\r\nhad formed, and incur the danger of losing nearly the whole of his\r\nstock. I lay it down as a fundamental principle in my nucleus system,\r\nthat the old stocks must never be so much weakened by the removal of\r\nbrood-comb and bees that they are not able to keep their numbers\r\nsufficiently strong to refill rapidly all the vacancies among their\r\ncombs. If the Apiarian attempts to multiply his stocks so rapidly that\r\nthis cannot be done, I will ensure him ample cause to repent at leisure\r\nof his folly. If however, the attempt at very rapid multiplication is\r\nmade only by those who are favorably situated, and who have skill in the\r\nmanagement of bees, a very large gain may be made in the number of\r\nstocks, and they may all be strong and flourishing.\r\n\r\nIf a strong stock of bees in a hive of moderate size, which admits of\r\nthorough inspection, is examined at the height of the honey harvest,\r\nnearly all the cells will often be found filled with brood, honey or\r\nbee-bread. The great laying of the queen, according to some writers, is\r\nnow over, not however as they erroneously imagine, because her fertility\r\nhas decreased, but merely because there is not _room_ in the hive for\r\nall her eggs. She may often be seen restlessly traversing the combs,\r\nseeking in vain for empty cells, until finding none, she is compelled to\r\nextrude her eggs only to be devoured by the bees. (See p. 52.) If some\r\nof the full combs are removed, and empty ones substituted in their\r\nplace, she will speedily fill them, laying at the rate of two or three\r\nthousand a day! When my strong stocks are from time to time deprived of\r\none or two combs, if honey can easily be procured,[19] the bees proceed\r\nat once to replace them, and the queen commences laying in the new combs\r\nas soon as the cells are fairly started. If the combs are not removed\r\n_too fast_, and care is taken not to deprive the stock of so much brood\r\nthat the bees cannot keep up a vigorous population, a queen in a hive so\r\nmanaged, will lay her eggs in cells to be nurtured by the bees, instead\r\nof being eaten up; and thus, in the course of the season, she may become\r\nthe mother of three or four times as many bees, as are reared in a hive\r\nunder other circumstances. By careful management, brood enough may, in\r\nthis way, be taken from a single hive, to build up a large number of\r\nnuclei. Towards the close of the season however, as such a hive has been\r\nconstantly tasked in building comb and feeding young bees, almost all\r\nits honey will have been used for these purposes, and although it may be\r\nvery populous, unless it is liberally fed, it will be sure to perish.\r\nSince the discovery that unbolted rye flour will answer so admirably as\r\na substitute for pollen, we can supply the bees not only with honey,\r\nwhen none can be obtained from the blossoms, but with an abundance of\r\nbee-bread, when pollen is scarce. As I am writing this chapter, (March\r\n29, 1853,) my bees are zealously engaged in taking the flour from some\r\nold combs in front of their hives, and they can be seen most beautifully\r\nmoulding the little pellets on their thighs. By my movable combs, I can\r\ngive them the flour at once in their hives, as it can easily be rubbed\r\ninto an empty comb. The importance of Dzierzon's discovers of a\r\nsubstitute for pollen, can hardly be over-estimated. If he had done\r\nnothing more for the cause of Apiarian science, no true-hearted\r\nbee-keeper would ever allow his name to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nIn the Chapter on Feeding, I shall give more specific directions as to\r\nthe way in which the cultivator must feed his bees, when he aims at\r\nincreasing, as rapidly as possible, the number of his stocks. Unless\r\nthis work is done with great judgment, he will find often that the more\r\nhe feeds, the less bees he has in his hives, the cells being all\r\noccupied with honey instead of brood. Such is the passion of bees for\r\nstoring away honey, that large supplies of it will always most seriously\r\ninterfere with breeding, unless the bees are sufficiently numerous to\r\nbuild new comb in which the queen can find room for her eggs.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that some who have but little experience in the\r\nmanagement of bees, are ready to imagine that they could easily strike\r\nout a simpler and better way of increasing the number of colonies. For\r\ninstance: let a full hive have half its comb and bees put into an empty\r\nhive, and the work of doubling, is without further trouble, effectually\r\naccomplished. But what will the queenless hive do, under such\r\ncircumstances? Why, build of course, queen cells, and rear another. But\r\nwhat kind of comb will they fill their hives with, before the young\r\nqueen begins to breed? Of that, perhaps, you had never thought. Let me\r\nnow lay down the only safe rule for all who engage in the multiplication\r\nof artificial swarms. Never, under _any_ circumstances, take so much\r\ncomb and brood from your stock hives, as seriously to reduce their\r\nnumbers. This should be to the Apiarian, as \"the law of the Medes and\r\nPersians, which altereth not.\"\r\n\r\nSuppose that I divide a populous stock, about swarming season, into four\r\nor five colonies; the strong probability is, that not one of them, if\r\nleft to themselves, will be strong enough to survive the Winter. If fed\r\nin the ordinary way, and yet not supplied with combs and bees, their\r\nruin will often be only accelerated. If, on the contrary, I had taken,\r\nfrom time to time, combs sufficient to form three or four nuclei, and\r\nhad strengthened the new colonies, in such a way as not to draw too\r\nseverely upon the resources of the parent stock, I might expect to see\r\nthem all, in due time, strong and flourishing.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of the year, if I desire to determine the strength of a\r\ncolony principally to raising young bees, I can easily effect it by the\r\nfollowing plan. A box is made, of the same inside dimensions with the\r\nlower hive, into which the combs and bees of a full hive can all be\r\ntransferred, as soon as the bees are gathering honey enough to build new\r\ncombs. This box is now set over the old hive, which contains its\r\ncomplement of frames with guide combs, or better still, with empty\r\ncombs. As soon as the bees begin to build, they take possession of the\r\nlower hive, through which they go in and out, and the queen descends\r\nwith them, in order to lay her eggs in the lower combs. As soon as the\r\nold apartment becomes pretty well filled, a large number of combs with\r\nmaturing bees, may be taken from the upper one, and when the hive below\r\nis full, they may all be safely removed. If none of the upper combs are\r\nremoved, they will be filled with honey, as soon as the brood is\r\nhatched; and as they will contain large stores of bee-bread, they will\r\nanswer admirably for replenishing stocks which have an insufficient\r\nsupply. In no other way, so far as I know, can so much honey be secured,\r\nand if quantity, not quality, is aimed at, or if the test of quality is\r\nits fitness for the use of the bees, I would recommend this mode as\r\nsuperior to any other. If two swarms are hived together, or a very\r\npowerful stock is lodged in a hive, so that at once they can have access\r\nto the upper apartment, an extraordinary quantity of honey can be\r\nsecured, and of a very excellent quality. As soon as the bees have\r\nraised one generation of young, in the combs of the upper box, or rather\r\nin a part of them, they will use it chiefly for storing honey, and all\r\nthat it contains may be taken from them. In flavor, it will be found to\r\nbe nearly as good as honey stored in what is called \"virgin comb.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Chapter on the Requisites of a good hive, I have said that in\r\nsize it should be adapted to the natural instincts of the bee, and yet\r\nadmit of enlarging or contracting, according to the wants of the colony\r\nplaced in it. I never use a hive, the main apartment of which, holds\r\nless than a Winchester bushel. If small colonies are placed in such a\r\nhive, it must be temporarily partitioned off, to suit the size of its\r\ninmates; for if bees have too much room given to them, they cannot\r\nconcentrate their animal heat, and are so much discouraged that they\r\noften abandon their hive. I am aware that many judicious Apiarians\r\nrecommend hives of much smaller dimensions, and I shall now give my\r\nreasons for using one so large. If a hive is too small, then in the\r\nSpring, the combs are soon filled with honey, bee-bread and brood, and\r\nthe surprising fertility of the queen bee, can be turned to no efficient\r\naccount. If the honey-harvest in any year, is deficient, such a colony\r\nis very apt to perish in the succeeding Winter; whereas in a large hive,\r\nthe honey stored up in a fruitful season, is a reserve supply, in time\r\nof need. In very large hives, I have seen large accumulations of honey\r\nwhich have been untouched for years, while on the same stand, stocks of\r\nabout the same age, in small hives have perished by starvation. A good\r\nearly swarm in any situation at all favorable, will fill, the first\r\nseason, a hive that holds a bushel: and if there is any location in\r\nwhich they cannot do this, a doubled swarm should be put into the hive,\r\nor bee-keeping may, as far as profit is concerned, be abandoned. But it\r\nmay be objected that if the swarm was not sufficiently strong to fill\r\ntheir hive, the bees often suffer from the cold in Winter, and become\r\ntoo much reduced in numbers, to build early and rapidly in the ensuing\r\nSpring. This is undoubtedly true, and hence the great importance of\r\nputting a generous allowance of bees into a hive at the first start,\r\nunless, as on my plan, the requisite strength can be given to them, at a\r\nsubsequent period. The hive, if large, should be all the more carefully\r\nprotected from extremes of cold, in order to give the bees an\r\nopportunity of developing their natural powers of re-production, to the\r\nbest advantage.\r\n\r\nIn such a hive, the queen will be able to breed almost every month in\r\nthe year, even in the coldest climates where bees flourish, and on the\r\nreturn of Spring, thousands of young bees will be found in it, which\r\ncould not have been bred in a small, or badly protected hive. The Polish\r\nhives described by Mr. Dohiogost, have already been referred to. Some of\r\nthese hold about three bushels, and yet the bees swarm from them with\r\ngreat regularity, and the swarms are often of immense size. These hives\r\nare admirably protected, and at the time of hiving at least _four_ times\r\nthe number of bees are lodged in them, that are ordinarily put into one\r\nof our hives. The queen bee, in such a hive, has ample room to lay her\r\nthree thousand eggs, or more, daily: and a prodigious colony is raised,\r\nwhich often stores enormous supplies of honey. As all the frames in my\r\nhives are of the same dimensions, the size of the hive may be\r\nconveniently varied, to suit the views of different bee-keepers; for\r\nthey may be large or small, according to the number of frames designed\r\nto be used. I hope, before long, to experiment with hives as large\r\nagain, as those that I now use; or rather, with such, as by containing\r\nan upper box, may be made to accommodate twice as many bees. This whole\r\nsubject of the proper size of hives, certainly needs to be taken\r\nentirely out of the region of conjecture, and to be put upon the basis\r\nof careful observations. Unquestionably the size will require, in some\r\nrespects, to be modified by the more or less favorable character of the\r\ncountry for bee-keeping; but I am satisfied that small hives will be\r\nfound of but little profit, and that large ones, unless well stocked\r\nwith bees, from the first, and thoroughly protected, will often fail to\r\nanswer any good end. If I should find on further experiment, that the\r\nvery large hives of which I have spoken, are better, my hives are at\r\npresent so constructed that without any alteration of existing parts,\r\nthey can easily be supplied with the required additions. I have already\r\nmentioned that I sometimes build my hives, three in one structure, in\r\norder to save expense in their construction. I do not however, wish to\r\nbe considered as recommending such hives as the best for general use.\r\nFor some purposes a single hive is unquestionably the best, as it can be\r\neasily moved by one person; and this, will many times be found to be a\r\npoint of great importance. The double hives, or two in one, are for most\r\npurposes, decidedly the best, as well as the cheapest. I have quite\r\nrecently contrived a plan of constructing my wooden hives in such a\r\nmanner as to give them very great protection against extremes of heat\r\nand cold, while at the same time they can be easily and cheaply made, by\r\nany one who can handle the simplest mechanical tools.\r\n\r\nIt has been previously stated that the queen bee cannot be induced to\r\nsting, by any kind of treatment however severe. The reason of this\r\nstrange unwillingness to use her natural and powerful weapon, will be\r\nobvious, when we consider how indispensable the preservation of her life\r\nis to the very existence of the colony, and that her single sting, the\r\nloss of which would be her death, could avail but little for their\r\ndefence, in case of an attack. She never uses her weapon, except when\r\nengaged in mortal combat with another queen. As soon as the two rivals\r\ncome together, they clinch, at once, with every demonstration of the\r\nmost vindictive hatred. Why then, are not both of them often destroyed?\r\nand why are not hives, in the swarming season, almost certain to become\r\nqueenless? We can never sufficiently admire the provision so simple and\r\nyet so effectual, by which such a calamity is prevented. The queen bee\r\nnever stings unless she has such an advantage in the combat, that she\r\ncan curve her body under that of her rival, in such a manner as to\r\ninflict a deadly wound, without any risk of being stung herself! The\r\nmoment that the position of the two combatants is such that neither has\r\nthe advantage, and that both are liable to perish, they not only refuse\r\nto sting, but disengage themselves, and suspend their conflict for a\r\nshort time! If it were not for this peculiarity of instinct, such\r\ncombats would very often terminate in the death of both the parties,\r\nand the race of bees would be in danger of becoming extinct.\r\n\r\nThe unwillingness of a swarm of bees, which has been deprived of its\r\nqueen, to receive another, until after some time has elapsed, must\r\nalways be borne in mind, by those who have anything to do with making\r\nartificial swarms. About 24 hours must elapse before it will be safe to\r\nintroduce a strange mother into a queenless hive; and even then, if she\r\nis not fertile, she will run a great risk of being destroyed. To prevent\r\nsuch losses, I adopt the German plan of confining the queen, in what\r\nthey call, \"a queen cage.\" A small hole, about as large as a thimble,\r\nmay be gouged out of a block, and covered over with wire gauze, or any\r\nother kind of perforated cover, so that when the queen is put in, the\r\nbees cannot enter to destroy her. Before long, they will cultivate an\r\nacquaintance, by thrusting their antennæ through to her; so that, when\r\nshe is liberated the next day, they will gladly adopt her in place of\r\nthe one they have lost. If a hole large enough for her to creep out, is\r\nclosed with wax, they will gnaw the wax away, and liberate her\r\nthemselves, from her confinement. Queens that seem bent on departing to\r\nthe woods, may be confined in the same way, until the colony has given\r\nup all thoughts of forsaking its hive. A small paste-board box with\r\nsuitable holes, or a wooden match-box thoroughly scalded, I have found\r\nto answer a very good purpose.\r\n\r\nI shall here describe what may be called a _Queen Nursery_ which I have\r\ncontrived to aid those who are engaged in the rapid multiplication of\r\ncolonies by artificial means. A solid block about an inch and a quarter\r\nthick, is substituted for one of my frames; holes, about one and a half\r\ninches in diameter, are bored through it, and covered on both sides,\r\nwith gauze wire slides; the wire ought to be such as will allow a\r\ncommon bee to pass through, but should be too small to permit a queen to\r\ndo the same. Any kind of perforated cover may be made to answer the same\r\npurpose as the gauze wire. If a number of sealed queens are on hand, and\r\nthere is danger that some may hatch, and destroy the others, before the\r\nApiarian can make use of them in forming artificial swarms, he may very\r\ncarefully cut out the combs containing them, and place them each in a\r\nseparate cradle! The bees having access to them, will give them proper\r\nattention, and as soon as they are hatched, will supply them with food,\r\nand thus they will always be on hand for use when they are needed. This\r\nNursery must of course, be established in a hive which has no mature\r\nqueen, or it will quickly be transformed into a slaughter house by the\r\nbees. I have not yet tested this plan so thoroughly as to be _certain_\r\nthat it will succeed; and I know so well the immense difference between\r\ntheoretical conjectures and practical results, that I consider nothing\r\nin the bee line, or indeed in any other line, as established, until it\r\nhas been submitted to the most rigorous demonstrations, and has\r\ntriumphantly passed from the mere regions of the brain to those of\r\nactual fact. A theory on any subject may seem so plausible as almost to\r\namount to a positive demonstration, and yet when put to the working\r\ntest, it is often found to be encumbered by some unforeseen difficulty,\r\nwhich speedily convinces even its sanguine projector, that it has no\r\npractical value. Nine things out of ten may work to a charm, and yet the\r\ntenth may be so connected with the other nine, that its failure renders\r\ntheir success of no account. When I first used this Nursery, I did not\r\ngive the bees access to it, and I found that the queens were not\r\nproperly developed, and died in their cells. Perhaps they did not\r\nreceive sufficient warmth, or were not treated in some other important\r\nrespects, as they would have been if left under the care of the bees.\r\nIn the multiplicity of my experiments, I did not repeat this one under a\r\nsufficient variety of circumstances, to ascertain the precise cause of\r\nfailure; nor have I as yet, tried whether it will answer perfectly, by\r\nadmitting the bees to the queen cells.\r\n\r\nLast Spring, I made one queen supply several hives with eggs, so as to\r\nkeep them strong in numbers while they were constantly engaged in\r\nrearing a large number of spare queens. Two hives which I shall call A\r\nand B, were deprived at intervals of a week, each of its queen,[20] in\r\norder to induce them to raise a number of young sealed queens for the\r\nuse of the Apiary. As soon as the queens in A, were of an age suitable\r\nto be removed, I took them away and gave the colony a fertile queen from\r\nanother hive, C; as soon as she had laid a large number of eggs in the\r\nempty cells, I removed the queen cells now sealed over, from B, and gave\r\nthem the loan of this fertile mother, until she had performed the same\r\nnecessary office for them. By this time, the queen cells in C, were\r\nsealed over; these were now removed, and the queen restored; she had\r\nthus made one circuit, and laid a very large number of eggs in the two\r\nhives which were first deprived of their queens. After allowing her to\r\nreplenish her own hive with eggs, I sent her out again on her\r\nperambulating mission, and by this new device was able to get an\r\nextraordinary number of young queens from the three hives, and at the\r\nsame time to preserve their numbers from seriously diminishing. Two\r\nqueens may in this way, be made in six hives to furnish all the\r\nsupernumerary queens which will be wanted in quite a large Apiary.\r\n\r\nIt will be perfectly obvious to every intelligent and ingenious\r\nApiarian, that the perfect control of the comb, is the _soul_ of an\r\nentirely new system of practical management, and that it may be modified\r\nto suit the wants of all who wish to cultivate bees. Even the advocate\r\nof the old fashioned plan of killing the bees, can with one of my hives,\r\ndestroy his faithful laborers, by shaking them into a tub of water,\r\nalmost, if not quite as speedily as by setting them over a sulphur pit;\r\nwhile after the work of death is accomplished, his honey will be free\r\nfrom disgusting fumes, and all the labor of cutting it out of the hive,\r\nmay be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nI am now prepared to answer an objection which doubtless has been\r\npresent in the minds of many, all the time that they have been reading\r\nthe various processes on which I rely for the multiplication of\r\ncolonies. A very large number of persons who keep bees, or who wish to\r\nkeep them, are so much afraid of them that they object entirely even to\r\nnatural swarming, because they are in danger of being stung in the\r\nprocess of hiving the bees. How are such persons to manage bees on my\r\nplan, which seems like bearding a lion in its very den! The truth is\r\nthat some persons are so very timid, or suffer so dreadfully from the\r\nsting of a bee, that they are every way disqualified from having\r\nanything to do with them, and ought either to have no bees upon their\r\npremises, or to entrust the care of them to some suitable person. By\r\nmanaging bees according to the directions furnished in this treatise,\r\nalmost any one can learn, by using a bee-dress, to superintend them,\r\nwith very little risk; while those who are favorites with them, may\r\ndispense entirely with any protection. I find in short, that the risk of\r\nbeing stung is really diminished by the use of my hives; although it\r\nwill be hard to convince those who have not seen them in use, that this\r\ncan be so.\r\n\r\nThere is still another class who either keep bees or can be induced to\r\nkeep them, and who are anxiously inquiring for some new hive or new plan\r\nby which, with little or no trouble, they may reap copious harvests of\r\nthe precious nectar. This is emphatically _the_ class to seize hold of\r\nevery new device, and waste their time and money to fill the coffers of\r\nthe ignorant or unprincipled. There never will be a \"royal road\" to\r\nprofitable bee-keeping. If there is any branch of rural economy which\r\nmore than all others demands care and experience, for its profitable\r\nmanagement, it is the keeping of bees; and those who have a painful\r\nconsciousness that the disposition to put off and neglect, was, so to\r\nspeak, born in them, and has never been got out of them, will do well to\r\nlet bees alone, unless they hope, by the study of their systematic\r\nindustry, to reform evil habits which are well nigh incurable.\r\n\r\nWhile I feel very sanguine that my system of management will be used\r\nextensively and very advantageously, by careful and skillful Apiarians,\r\nI know too much of the world to expect that it will, with the masses,\r\nvery speedily supercede other methods, even if it were so absolutely\r\nperfect, as to admit of no possible improvement. I hope, however, that I\r\nmay, without being charged with presumption, be permitted to put on\r\nrecord the prediction, that _movable frames_ will in due season, be\r\nalmost universally employed; and this, whether bees are allowed to swarm\r\nnaturally, or are increased by artificial means, or are kept in hives in\r\nwhich they are not expected to swarm at all.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--The very day on which I first contrived the plan, so\r\n    perfectly simple, and yet so efficacious, of gaining the control of\r\n    the combs by these frames, I not only foresaw all the consequences\r\n    which would follow their adoption, but wrote as follows, in my\r\n    Bee-Journal. \"The use of these frames will, I am persuaded, give a\r\n    new impulse to the easy and profitable management of bees; and will\r\n    render the making of artificial swarms an easy operation.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] I have often spent more than ten minutes in opening and shutting a\r\nsingle frame in the Huber hive, and even then, have sometimes crushed\r\nsome of the bees.\r\n\r\n[18] The scent of the hives, during the height of the gathering season,\r\nwill usually inform us from what sources the bees have gathered their\r\nsupplies.\r\n\r\n[19] If they cannot obtain it, the Apiarian must himself furnish it.\r\n\r\n[20] The queens taken from such hives may be advantageously used in\r\nforming artificial colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE BEE-MOTH, AND OTHER ENEMIES OF BEES. DISEASES OF BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the numerous enemies of the honey-bee, the Bee-Moth (Tinea\r\nmellonella,) in climates of hot Summers, is by far, the most to be\r\ndreaded. So wide spread and fatal have been its ravages in this country,\r\nthat thousands have abandoned the cultivation of bees in despair, and in\r\ndistricts which once produced abundant supplies of the purest honey,\r\nbee-keeping has gradually dwindled down into a very insignificant\r\npursuit. Contrivances almost without number, have been devised, to\r\ndefend the bees against this invidious foe, but still it continues its\r\ndesolating inroads, almost unchecked, laughing as it were to scorn, at\r\nall the so-called \"moth-proof\" hives, and turning many of the ingenious\r\nfixtures designed to entrap or exclude it, into actual aids and comforts\r\nin its nefarious designs.\r\n\r\nI should feel but little confidence in being able to reinstate\r\nbee-keeping in our country, into a certain and profitable pursuit, if I\r\ncould not show the Apiarian in what way he can safely bid defiance to\r\nthe pestiferous assaults of this, his most implacable enemy. I have\r\npatiently studied its habits for years, and I am at length able to\r\nannounce a system of management founded upon the peculiar construction\r\nof my hives, which will enable the careful bee-keeper to protect his\r\ncolonies against the monster. The CAREFUL bee-keeper, I say: for to\r\npretend that the careless one, can by any contrivance effect this, is \"a\r\nsnare and a delusion;\" and no well-informed man, unless he is steeped to\r\nthe very lips, in fraud and imposture, will ever claim to accomplish any\r\nthing of the kind. The bee-moth infects our Apiaries, just as weeds take\r\npossession of a fertile soil; and the negligent bee-keeper will find a\r\n\"moth-proof\" hive, when the sluggard finds a _weed-proof_ soil, and I\r\nsuspect not until a consummation so devoutly wished for by the slothful\r\nhas arrived. Before explaining the means upon which I rely, to\r\ncircumvent the moth, I will first give a brief description of its\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nSwammerdam, towards the close of the 17th century, gave a very accurate\r\ndescription of this insect, which was then called by the very expressive\r\nname of the \"bee-wolf.\" He has furnished good drawings of it, in all its\r\nchanges, from the worm to the perfect moth, together with the peculiar\r\nwebs or galleries which it constructs and from which the name of Tinea\r\nGalleria or gallery moth, has been given to it by some entomologists. He\r\nfailed, however, to discriminate between the male and female, which,\r\nbecause they differ so much in size and appearance, he supposed to be\r\ntwo different species of the wax-moth. It seems to have been a great\r\npest in his time; and even Virgil speaks of the \"dirum tineæ genus,\" the\r\ndreadful _offspring_ of the moth; that is the worm. This destroyer\r\nusually makes its appearance about the hives, in April or May; the time\r\nof its coming, depending upon the warmth of the climate, or the\r\nforwardness of the season. It is seldom seen on the wing, (unless\r\nstartled from its lurking place about the hive,) until towards dark, and\r\nis evidently, chiefly nocturnal in its habits. In dark cloudy days,\r\nhowever, I have noticed it on the wing long before sunset, and if\r\nseveral such days follow in succession, the female oppressed with the\r\nurgent necessity of laying her eggs, may be seen endeavoring to gain\r\nadmission to the hives. The female is much larger than the male, and\r\n\"her color is deeper and more inclining to a darkish gray, with small\r\nspots or blackish streaks on the interior edge of her upper wings.\" The\r\ncolor of the male inclines more to a light gray; they might easily be\r\nmistaken for different species of moths. These insects are surprisingly\r\nagile, both on foot and on the wing. The motions of a bee are very slow\r\nin comparison. \"They are,\" says Reaumur, \"the most nimble-footed\r\ncreatures that I know.\" \"If the approach to the Apiary[21] be observed\r\nof a moonlight evening, the moths will be found flying or running round\r\nthe hives, watching an opportunity to enter, whilst the bees that have\r\nto guard the entrances against their intrusion, will be seen acting as\r\nvigilant sentinels, performing continual rounds near this important\r\npost, extending their antennæ to the utmost, and moving them to the\r\nright and left alternately. Woe to the unfortunate moth that comes\r\nwithin their reach!\" \"It is curious,\" says Huber, \"to observe how\r\nartfully the moth knows how to profit, to the disadvantage of the bees,\r\nwhich require much light for seeing objects; and the precautions taken\r\nby the latter in reconnoitering and expelling so dangerous an enemy.\"\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the moth into a hive, and the ravages committed by her\r\nprogeny, forcibly remind one of the sad havoc which sin often makes of\r\ncharacter and happiness, when it finds admission into the human heart,\r\nand is allowed to prey unchecked, upon all its most precious treasures;\r\nand he who would not be so enslaved by its power, as to lose all his\r\nspiritual life and prosperity, must be constantly on the defensive, and\r\never on the \"watch\" against its fatal intrusions.\r\n\r\nOnly some tiny eggs are deposited by the moth, and they give birth to a\r\nvery delicate, innocent-looking worm; but let these apparently\r\ninsignificant creatures once \"get the upper hand,\" and all the fragrance\r\nof the honied dome, is soon corrupted by their abominable stench; every\r\nthing beautiful and useful, is ruthlessly destroyed; the hum of happy\r\nindustry is stilled, and at last, nothing is left in the desecrated\r\nhive, but a set of ravenous, half famished worms, knotting and writhing\r\naround each other, in most loathsome convolutions.\r\n\r\nWax is the proper aliment of the larvæ of the bee-moth: and upon this\r\nseemingly indigestible substance, they thrive and fatten. When obliged\r\nto steal their living as best they can, among a powerful stock of bees,\r\nthey are exposed, during their growth, to many perils, and seldom fare\r\nwell enough to reach their natural size: but if they are rioting at\r\npleasure, among the full combs of a feeble and discouraged population,\r\nthey often attain a size and corpulency truly astonishing. If the\r\nbee-keeper wishes to see their innate capabilities fully developed, let\r\nhim rear a lot for himself among some old combs, and if prizes were\r\noffered for fat and full grown worms, he might easily obtain one. In the\r\ncourse of a few weeks, the larva like that of the silk-worm, stops\r\neating, and begins to think of a suitable place for encasing itself in\r\nits silky shroud. In hives where they reign uncontrolled, this is a work\r\nof but little difficulty; almost any place will answer their purpose,\r\nand they often pile their cocoons, one on top of another, or join them\r\nin long rows together: but in hives strongly guarded by healthy bees,\r\nthis is a matter not very easily accomplished; and many a worm while it\r\nis cautiously prying about, to see where it can find some snug place in\r\nwhich to ensconce itself, is caught by the nape of the neck, and very\r\nunceremoniously served with an instant writ of ejection from the hive.\r\nIf a hive is thoroughly made, of sound materials, and has no cracks or\r\ncrevices under which the worm can retreat, it is obliged to leave the\r\ninterior in search of such a place, and it runs a most dangerous\r\ngantlet, as it passes, for this purpose, through the ranks of its\r\nenraged foes. Even in the worm state, however, its motions are\r\nexceedingly quick; it can crawl backwards or forwards, and as well one\r\nway as another: it can twist round on itself, curl up almost into a\r\nknot, and flatten itself out like a pancake! in short, it is full of\r\nstratagems and cunning devices. If obliged to leave the hive, it gets\r\nunder any board or concealed crack, spins its cocoon, and patiently\r\nawaits its transformation. In most of the common hives, it is under no\r\nnecessity of leaving its birth place for this purpose. It is almost\r\ncertain to find a crack or flaw into which it can creep, or a small\r\nspace between the bottom-board and the edges of the hive which rest upon\r\nit. A _very_ small crevice will answer all its purposes. It enters, by\r\nflattening itself out almost as much as though it had been passed under\r\na roller, and as soon as it is safe from the bees, it speedily begins to\r\ngive its cramped tenement, the requisite proportions. It is utterly\r\namazing how an insect apparently so feeble, can do this; but it will\r\noften gnaw for itself a cavity, even in solid wood, and thus enlarge its\r\nretreat, until it has ample room for making its cocoon! The time when it\r\nwill break forth into a winged insect, depends entirely upon the degree\r\nof heat to which it is exposed. I have had them spin their cocoons and\r\nhatch in a temperature of about 70°, in ten or eleven days, and I have\r\nknown them to spin so late in the Fall, that they remained all Winter,\r\nundeveloped, and did not emerge until the warm weather of the ensuing\r\nSpring!\r\n\r\nIf they are hatched in the hive, they leave it, in order to attend to\r\nthe business of impregnation. In the moth state, they do not actually\r\nattack the hives, to plunder them of food, although they have a \"sweet\r\ntooth\" in their head, and are easily attracted by the odor of liquid\r\nsweets. The male, having no special business in the hive, usually keeps\r\nhimself at a safe distance from the bees: but the female, impelled by an\r\nirresistible instinct, seeks admission, in order to deposit her eggs\r\nwhere her offspring may gain the readiest access to their natural food.\r\nShe carefully explores all the cracks and crevices about the\r\nbottom-board, and if she finds a suitable place under them, lays her\r\neggs among the parings of the combs, and other refuse matter which has\r\nfallen from the hive. If she enters a feeble or discouraged stock, where\r\nshe can act her own pleasure, she will lay her eggs among the combs. In\r\na hive where she is too closely watched to effect this, she will insert\r\nthem in the corners, into the soft propolis, or in any place where there\r\nare small pieces of wax and bee-bread, which have fallen upon the\r\nbottom-board, and which will furnish a temporary place of concealment\r\nfor her progeny, and also the requisite nourishment, until they have\r\nstrength and enterprise enough to reach the main combs of the hive, and\r\nfortify themselves there. \"As soon as hatched,[22] the worm encloses\r\nitself in a case of white silk, which it spins around its body; at first\r\nit is like a mere thread, but gradually increases in size, and during\r\nits growth, feeds upon the cells around it, for which purpose it has\r\nonly to put forth its head, and find its wants supplied. It devours its\r\nfood with great avidity, and consequently increases so much in bulk,\r\nthat its gallery soon becomes too short and narrow, and the creature is\r\nobliged to thrust itself forward and lengthen the gallery, as well to\r\nobtain more room as to procure an additional supply of food. Its\r\naugmented size exposing it to attacks from surrounding foes, the wary\r\ninsect fortifies its new abode with additional strength and thickness,\r\nby blending with the filaments of its silken covering, a mixture of wax\r\nand its own excrement, for the external barrier of a new gallery, the\r\n_interior_ and partitions of which are lined with a smooth surface of\r\nwhite silk, which admits the occasional movements of the insect, without\r\ninjury to its delicate (?) texture. In performing these operations, the\r\ninsect might be expected to meet with opposition from the bees, and to\r\nbe gradually rendered more assailable as it advanced in age. It never,\r\nhowever, exposes any part but its head and neck, both of which are\r\ncovered with stout helmets or scales impenetrable to the sting of a bee,\r\nas is the composition of the galleries that surround it.\" As soon as it\r\nhas reached its full growth, it seeks in the manner previously\r\ndescribed, a secure place for undergoing its changes into a winged\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the way in which I protect my hives from this deadly\r\npest, I shall first show why the bee-moth has so wonderfully increased\r\nin numbers in this country, and how the use of patent hives has so\r\npowerfully contributed to encourage its ravages. It ought to be borne in\r\nmind that our climate is altogether more propitious to its rapid\r\nincrease, than that of Great Britain. Our intensely hot summers develop\r\nmost rapidly and powerfully, insect life, and those parts of our country\r\nwhere the heat is most protracted and intense, have, as a general thing,\r\nsuffered most from the devastations of the bee-moth.\r\n\r\nThe bee is not a native of the American continent; it was first brought\r\nhere by colonists from Great Britain, and was called by the Indians, the\r\nwhite man's fly. With the bee, was introduced its natural enemy,\r\ncreated for the special purpose, not of destroying the insect, on whose\r\nindustry it thrives, and whose extermination would be fatal to the moth\r\nitself, but that it might gain its livelihood as best it could in this\r\nbusy world. Finding itself in a country whose climate is exceedingly\r\npropitious to its rapid increase, it has multiplied and increased a\r\nthousand fold, until now there is hardly a spot where the bees inhabit,\r\nwhich is not infested by its powerful enemy.\r\n\r\nI have often listened to the glowing accounts of the vast supplies of\r\nhoney obtained by the first settlers, from their bees. Fifty years ago,\r\nthe markets in our large cities were much more abundantly supplied than\r\nthey now are, and it was no uncommon thing to see exposed for sale,\r\nlarge washing-tubs filled with the most beautiful honey. Various reasons\r\nhave been assigned for the present depressed state of Apiarian pursuits.\r\nSome imagine that newly settled countries are most favorable for the\r\nlabors of the bee: others, that we have overstocked our farms, so that\r\nthe bees cannot find a sufficient supply of food. That neither of these\r\nreasons will account for the change, I shall prove more at length, in my\r\nremarks on Honey, and when I discuss the question of overstocking a\r\ndistrict with bees. Others lay all the blame upon the bee-moth, and\r\nothers still, upon our departure from the good old-fashioned way of\r\nmanaging bees. That the bee-moth has multiplied most astonishingly, is\r\nundoubtedly true. In many districts, it so superabounds, that the man\r\nwho should expect to manage his bees with as little care as his father\r\nand grandfather bestowed upon them, and yet realize as large profits,\r\nwould find himself most wofully mistaken. The old bee-keeper often never\r\nlooked at his bees after the swarming season, until the time came for\r\nappropriating their spoils. He then carefully \"hefted\" all his hives so\r\nas to be able to judge as well as he could, how much honey they\r\ncontained. All which were found to be too light to survive the Winter,\r\nhe at once condemned; and if any were deficient in bees, or for any\r\nother reason, appeared to be of doubtful promise, they were, in like\r\nmanner, sentenced to the sulphur pit. A certain number of those\r\ncontaining the largest supplies of honey, were also treated in the same\r\nsummary way: while the requisite number of the _very best_, were\r\nreserved to replenish his stock another season. If the same system\r\nprecisely, were now followed, a number of colonies would still perish\r\nannually, through the increased devastations of the moth.\r\n\r\nThe change which has taken place in the circumstances of the bee-keeper,\r\nmay be illustrated by supposing that when the country was first settled,\r\nweeds were almost unknown. The farmer plants his corn, and then lets it\r\nalone, and as there are no weeds to molest it, at the end of the season\r\nhe harvests a fair crop. Suppose, however, that in process of time, the\r\nweeds begin to spread more and more, until at last, this farmer's son or\r\ngrandson finds that they entirely choke his corn, and that he cannot, in\r\nthe old way, obtain a remunerating crop. Now listen to him, as he\r\ngravely informs you that he cannot tell how it is, but corn with him has\r\nall \"run out.\" He manages it precisely as his father or grandfather\r\nalways managed theirs, but somehow the pestiferous weeds will spring up,\r\nand he has next to no crop. Perhaps you can hardly conceive of such\r\ntransparent ignorance and stupidity; but it would be difficult to show\r\nthat it would be one whit greater than that of a large number who keep\r\nbees in places where the bee-moth abounds, and who yet imagine that\r\nthose plans which answered perfectly well fifty or a hundred years ago,\r\nwhen moths were scarce, will answer just as well now.\r\n\r\nIf however, the old plan had been rigidly adhered to, the ravages of the\r\nbee-moth would never have been so great as they now are. The\r\nintroduction of _patent hives_ has contributed most powerfully, to fill\r\nthe land with the devouring pest. I am perfectly aware that this is a\r\nbold assertion, and that it may, at first sight, appear to be very\r\nuncourteous, if not unjust, to the many intelligent and ingenious\r\nApiarians, who have devoted much time, and spent large sums of money, in\r\nperfecting hives designed to enable the bee-keeper to contend most\r\nsuccessfully against his worst enemy. As I do not wish to treat such\r\npersons with even the appearance of disrespect, I shall endeavor to show\r\njust how the use of the hives which they have devised, has contributed\r\nto undermine the prosperity of the bees. Many of these hives have\r\nvaluable properties, and if they were always used in strict accordance\r\nwith the enlightened directions of those who have invented them, they\r\nwould undoubtedly be real and substantial improvements over the old box\r\nor straw hive, and would greatly aid the bee-keeper in his contest with\r\nthe moth. The great difficulty is that they are none of them, able to\r\ngive him the facilities which alone can make him victorious. No hive, as\r\nI shall soon show, can ever do this, which does not give the complete\r\nand easy control of all the combs.\r\n\r\nI do not know of a single improved hive which does not aim at entirely\r\ndoing away with the old-fashioned plan of killing the bees. Such a\r\npractice is denounced as being almost as cruel and silly as to kill a\r\nhen for the sake of obtaining her feathers or a few of her eggs. Now if\r\nthe Apiarian can be furnished with suitable instructions, and such as he\r\nwill _practice_, for managing his bees so as to avoid this necessity,\r\nthen I admit the full force of all the objections which have been urged\r\nagainst it. I have never read the beautiful verses of the poet\r\nThompson, without feeling all their force:\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, see, where robbed and murdered in that pit\r\n    Lies the still heaving hive! at evening snatched,\r\n    Beneath the cloud of guilt-concealing night,\r\n    And fixed o'er sulphur! while, not dreaming ill,\r\n    The happy people, in their waxen cells,\r\n    Sat tending public cares;\r\n    Sudden, the dark oppressive steam ascends,\r\n    And, used to milder scents, the tender race,\r\n    By thousands, tumble from their honied dome!\r\n    Into a gulf of blue sulphureous flame.\"\r\n\r\nThe plain matter of fact however, is, that in our country, as many bees,\r\nif not more, die of starvation in their hives, as ever were killed by\r\nthe fumes of sulphur. Commend me rather to the humanity of the\r\nold-fashioned bee-keeper, who put to a speedy and therefore merciful\r\ndeath, the poor bees which are now, by millions, tortured by slow\r\nstarvation among their empty combs! At the present time, (April 1853,) I\r\nam almost daily hearing of swarms which have perished in this way,\r\nduring the last Winter; and I know of only one person who was merciful\r\nenough to kill his weak stocks, rather than suffer them to die so cruel\r\na death.\r\n\r\nIf the use of the common patent hives could only keep the stocks strong\r\nin numbers, and if the bee-keepers would always see that they were well\r\nsupplied with honey, then I admit that to kill the bees would be both\r\ncruel and unnecessary. Such however, are the discouragements and losses\r\nnecessarily attending the use of any hive which does not give the\r\ncontrol of the combs, that there will be few who do not continually find\r\nthat some of their stocks are too feeble to be worth the labor and\r\nexpense of attempting to preserve them over Winter. How many colonies\r\nare annually wintered, which are not only of no value to their owner,\r\nbut are positive nuisances in his Apiary; being so feeble in the Spring,\r\nthat they are speedily overcome by the moth, and answer only to breed a\r\nhorde of destroyers to ravage the rest of his Apiary. The time spent\r\nupon them is often as absolutely wasted, as the time devoted to a sick\r\nanimal incurably diseased, and which can never be of any service, while\r\nby nursing it along, its owner incurs the risk of infecting his whole\r\nstock with its deadly taint. If, on the score of kindness, he should\r\nshut it up, and let it starve to death, few of us, I imagine, would care\r\nto cultivate a very intimate acquaintance with one so extremely original\r\nin the exhibition of his humanity!\r\n\r\nEver since the introduction of patent hives, the notion has almost\r\nuniversally prevailed, that stocks must not, under _any_ circumstances,\r\nbe voluntarily broken up; and hence, instead of Apiaries, filled in the\r\nSpring, with strong and healthy stocks of bees, easily able to protect\r\nthemselves against the bee-moth, and all other enemies, we have\r\nmultitudes of colonies which, if they had been kept on purpose to\r\nfurnish food for the worms, could scarcely have answered a more valuable\r\nend in encouraging their increase. The simple truth is, that improved\r\nhives, without an improved system of management, have done on the whole\r\nmore harm than good; in no country have they been so extensively used as\r\nin our own, and no where has the moth so completely gained the\r\nascendency. Just so far as they have discouraged bee-keepers from the\r\nold plan of killing off all their weak swarms in the Fall, just so far\r\nhave they extended \"aid and comfort\" to the moth, and made the condition\r\nof the bee-keeper worse than it was before. That some of them might be\r\nmanaged so as in all ordinary cases, to give the bees complete\r\nprotection against their scourge, I do not, for a moment, question; but\r\nthat they cannot, from the very nature of the case, answer fully in all\r\nemergencies, the ends for which they were designed, I shall endeavor to\r\nprove and not to assert.\r\n\r\nThe kind of hives of which I have been speaking, are such as have been\r\ndevised by intelligent and honest men, practically acquainted with the\r\nmanagement of bees: as for many of the hives which have been introduced,\r\nthey not only afford the Apiarian no assistance against the inroads of\r\nthe bee-moth, but they are so constructed as positively to aid it in its\r\nnefarious designs. The more they are used, the worse the poor bees are\r\noff: just as the more a man uses the lying nostrums of the brazen-faced\r\nquack, the further he finds himself from health and vigor.\r\n\r\nI once met with an intelligent man who told me that he had paid a\r\nconsiderable sum, to a person who professed to be in possession of many\r\nvaluable _secrets_ in the management of bees, and who promised, among\r\nother things, to impart to him an infallible remedy against the\r\nbee-moth. On the receipt of the money, he very gravely told him that the\r\nsecret of keeping the moth out of the hive, was to keep the bees strong\r\nand vigorous! A truer declaration he could not have made, but I believe\r\nthat the bee-keeper felt, notwithstanding, that he had been imposed\r\nupon, as outrageously, as a poor man would be, who after paying a quack\r\na large sum of money for an infallible, life-preserving secret, should\r\nbe turned off with the truism that the secret of living forever, was to\r\nkeep well!\r\n\r\nThere is not an intelligent, observing Apiarian who has been in the\r\nhabit of carefully examining the operations of bees, not only in his own\r\nApiary, but wherever he could find them, who has not seen strong stocks\r\nflourishing under almost any conceivable circumstances. They may be seen\r\nin hives of the most miserable construction, unpainted and unprotected,\r\nsometimes with large open cracks and clefts extending down their sides,\r\nand yet laughing to defiance, the bee-moth, and all other adverse\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\nAlmost any thing hollow, in which the bees can establish themselves, and\r\nwhere they have once succeeded in becoming strong, will often be\r\nsuccessfully tenanted by them for a series of years. To see such hives,\r\nas they sometimes may be seen, in possession of persons both ignorant\r\nand careless, and who hardly know a bee-moth from any other kind of\r\nmoth, may at first sight well shake the confidence of the inquirer, in\r\nthe necessity or value of any particular precautions to preserve his\r\nhives from the devastations of the moth.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at these powerful stocks in what may be called log-cabin\r\nhives, let us examine some in the most costly hives, which have ever\r\nbeen constructed; in what have been called real \"Bee-Palaces;\" and we\r\nshall often find them weak and impoverished, infested and almost\r\ndevoured by the worms. Their owner, with books in his hand, and all the\r\nnewest devices and appliances in the Apiarian line, unable to protect\r\nhis bees against their enemies, or to account for the reason why some\r\nhives seem, like the children of the poor, almost to thrive upon\r\nill-treatment and neglect, while others, like the offspring of the rich\r\nand powerful, are feeble and diseased, almost in exact proportion to the\r\nmeans used to guard them against noxious influences, and to minister\r\nmost lavishly to all their wants.\r\n\r\nI once used to be much surprised to hear so many bee-keepers speak of\r\nhaving \"good luck,\" or \"bad luck\" with their bees; but really as bees\r\nare generally managed, success or failure does seem to depend almost\r\nentirely upon what the ignorant or superstitious are wont to call\r\n\"luck.\"\r\n\r\nI shall now try to do what I have never yet seen satisfactorily done by\r\nany writer on bees; viz.: show exactly under what circumstances the\r\nbee-moth succeeds in establishing itself in a hive; thus explaining why\r\nsome stocks flourish in spite of all neglect, while others, in the\r\ncommon hives, fall a prey to the moth, let their owner be as careful as\r\nhe will, I shall finally show how in suitable hives, with proper\r\nprecautions, it may always be kept from seriously annoying the bees.\r\n\r\nIt often happens, when a large number of stocks are kept, that in spite\r\nof all precautions, some of them are found in the Spring, so greatly\r\nreduced in numbers, that if left to themselves, they are in danger of\r\nfalling a prey to the devouring moth. Bees, when in feeble colonies,\r\nseem often to lose a portion of their wonted vigilance, and as they have\r\na large quantity of empty comb which they cannot guard, even if they\r\nwould, the moth enters the hive, and deposits a large number of eggs,\r\nand thus before the bees have become sufficiently numerous to protect\r\nthemselves, the combs are filled with worms, and the destruction of the\r\ncolony speedily follows. The ignorant or careless bee-keeper is informed\r\nof the ravages which are going on in such a hive, only when its ruin is\r\nfully completed, and a cloud of winged pests issues from it, to destroy\r\nif they can, the rest of his stocks. But how, it may be asked, can it be\r\nascertained that a hive is seriously infested with the all-devouring\r\nworms? The aspect of the bees, so discouraged and forlorn, proclaims at\r\nonce that there is trouble of some kind within. If the hive be slightly\r\nelevated, the bottom-board will be found covered with pieces of\r\nbee-bread, &c. mixed with the _excrement of the worms_ which looks\r\nalmost exactly like fine grains of powder. As the bees in Spring, clean\r\nout their combs, and prepare the cells for the reception of brood, their\r\nbottom-board will often be so covered with parings of comb and with\r\nsmall pieces of bee-bread, that the hive may appear to be in danger of\r\nbeing destroyed by the worms. If, however, none of the _black_ excrement\r\nis perceived, the refuse on the bottom-board, like the shavings in a\r\ncarpenter's shop, are proofs of industry and not the signs of\r\napproaching ruin. It is highly important, however, to keep the\r\nbottom-boards clean, and if a piece of zinc be slipt in, (or even an old\r\nnewspaper,) by removing and cleansing it from time to time, the bees\r\nwill be greatly assisted in their operations. As soon as the hive is\r\nwell filled with bees, this need no longer be done.\r\n\r\nEven the most careful and experienced Apiarian will find, too often,\r\nthat although he is perfectly well aware of the plague that is reigning\r\nwithin, his knowledge can be turned to no good account, the interior of\r\nthe hive being almost as inaccessible as the interior of the human body.\r\nThe way in which I manage, in such cases, is as follows.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained, in the Spring, as soon as the bees begin to fly out,\r\nthat a colony although feeble, has a fertile queen, I take the\r\nprecaution at once to give it the strength which is indispensable, not\r\nmerely to its safety, but to its ability for any kind of successful\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nAs a certain number of bees are needed in a hive, in order as well to\r\nwarm and hatch the thousands of eggs which a healthy queen can lay, as\r\nto feed and properly develop the larvæ after they are hatched, I know\r\nthat a feeble colony must remain feeble for a long time, unless they can\r\nat once be supplied with a considerable accession of numbers. Even if\r\nthere were no moths in existence to trouble such a hive, it would not be\r\nable to rear a large number of bees, until after the best of the\r\nhoney-harvest had passed away: and then it would become powerful only\r\nthat its increasing numbers might devour the food which the others had\r\npreviously stored in the cells. If the small colony has a considerable\r\nnumber of bees, and is able to cover and warm at least one comb in\r\naddition to those containing brood which they already have, I take from\r\none of my strong stocks, a frame containing some three or four thousand\r\nor more young bees, which are sealed over in their cells, and are just\r\nready to emerge. These bees which require no food, and need nothing but\r\nwarmth to develop them, will, in a few days, hatch in the new hive to\r\nwhich they are given, and thus the requisite number of workers, in the\r\nfull vigor and energy of youth, will be furnished to the hive, and the\r\ndiscouraged queen, finding at once a suitable number of experienced\r\nnurses[23] to take charge of her eggs, deposits them in the proper\r\ncells, instead of simply extruding them, to be devoured by the bees.\r\nWhile bees often attack full grown strangers which are introduced into\r\ntheir hive, they never fail to receive gladly all the brood comb that we\r\nchoose to give them. If they are sufficiently numerous, they will always\r\ncherish it, and in warm weather, they will protect it, even if it is\r\nlaid against the outside of their hive! If the bees in the weak stock,\r\nare too much reduced in numbers, to be able to cover the brood comb\r\ntaken from another hive, I give them this comb with all the old bees\r\nthat are clustered upon it, and shut up the hive, after supplying them\r\nwith water, until two or three days have passed away. By this time, most\r\nof the strange bees will have formed an inviolable attachment to their\r\nnew home, and even if a portion of them should return to the parent\r\nhive, a large number of the maturing young will have hatched, to supply\r\ntheir desertion. A little sugar-water scented with peppermint, may be\r\nused to sprinkle the bees, at the time that the comb is introduced,\r\nalthough I have never yet found that they had the least disposition, to\r\nquarrel with each other. The original settlers are only too glad to\r\nreceive such a valuable accession to their scanty numbers, and the\r\nexpatriated bees are too-much confounded with their unexpected\r\nemigration, to feel any desire for making a disturbance. If a sufficient\r\nincrease of numbers has not been furnished by one range of comb, the\r\noperation may, in the course of a few days, be repeated. Instead of\r\nleaving the colony to the discouraging feeling that they are in a large,\r\nempty and desolate house, a divider should be run down into the hive,\r\nand they should be confined to a space which they are able to warm and\r\ndefend, and the rest of the hive, until they need its additional room,\r\nshould be carefully shut up against all intruders. If this operation is\r\njudiciously performed, the bees will be powerful in numbers, long before\r\nthe weather is warm enough to develop the bee-moth, and they will thus\r\nbe most effectually protected from the hateful pest.\r\n\r\nA very simple change in the organization of the bee-moth would have\r\nrendered it almost if not quite impossible to protect the bees from its\r\nravages. If it had been so constituted as to require but a very small\r\namount of heat for its full development, it would have become very\r\nnumerous early in the Spring, and might then have easily entered the\r\nhives and deposited its eggs among the combs, without any let or\r\nhindrance; for at this season, not only do the bees at night maintain no\r\nguard at the entrance of their hive, but there are large portions of\r\ntheir comb bare of bees, and of course, entirely unprotected. How does\r\nevery fact in the history of the bee, when properly investigated, point\r\nwith unerring certainty to the power, wisdom and goodness, of Him who\r\nmade it!\r\n\r\nIf there is reason to apprehend that the combs which are not occupied\r\nwith brood, contain any of the eggs of the moth, these combs may be\r\nremoved, and thoroughly smoked with the fumes of burning sulphur; and\r\nthen, in a few days, after they have been exposed to the fresh air, they\r\nmay be returned to the hive. I hope I may be pardoned for feeling not\r\nthe slightest pity for the unfortunate progeny of the moth, thus\r\nunceremoniously destroyed.\r\n\r\nBees, as is well known to every experienced bee-keeper, frequently swarm\r\nso often as to expose themselves to great danger of being destroyed by\r\nthe moth. After the departure of the after-swarms, the parent colony\r\noften contains too few bees to cover and protect their combs from the\r\ninsidious attacks of their wily enemy. As a number of weeks must elapse\r\nbefore the brood of the young queen is mature, the colony, for a\r\nconsiderable time, at the season when the moths are very numerous, are\r\nconstantly diminishing in numbers, and before they can begin to\r\nreplenish the exhausted hive, the destroyer has made a fatal lodgment.\r\n\r\nIn my hives, such calamities are easily prevented. If artificial\r\nincrease is relied upon for the multiplication of colonies, it can be so\r\nconducted as to give the moth next to no chance to fortify itself in the\r\nhive. No colony is ever allowed to have more room than it needs, or more\r\ncombs than it can cover and protect; and the entrance to the hive may be\r\ncontracted, if necessary, so that only a single bee can go in and out,\r\nat a time, and yet the bees will have, from the ventilators, as much air\r\nas they require.\r\n\r\nIf natural swarming is allowed, after-swarms may be prevented from\r\nissuing, by cutting out all the queen cells but one, soon after the\r\nfirst swarm leaves the hive; or if it is desired to have as fast an\r\nincrease of stocks, as can possibly be obtained from natural swarming,\r\nthen instead of leaving the combs in the parent hive to be attacked by\r\nthe moth, a certain portion of them may be taken out, when swarming is\r\nover, and given to the second and third swarms, so as to aid in building\r\nthem up into strong stocks.\r\n\r\nBut I have not yet spoken of the most fruitful cause of the desolating\r\nravages of the bee-moth. If a colony has _lost its queen_, and this loss\r\ncannot be supplied, it must, as a matter of course, fall a sacrifice to\r\nthe bee-moth: and I do not hesitate to assert that by far the larger\r\nproportion of colonies which are destroyed by it, are destroyed under\r\nprecisely such circumstances! Let this be remembered by all who have any\r\nthing to do with bees, and let them understand that unless a remedy for\r\nthe loss of the queen, can be provided, they must constantly expect to\r\nsee some of their best colonies hopelessly ruined. The crafty moth,\r\nafter all, is not so much to blame, as we are apt to imagine; for a\r\ncolony, once deprived of its queen, and possessing no means of securing\r\nanother, would certainly perish, even if never attacked by so deadly an\r\nenemy; just as the body of an animal, when deprived of life, will\r\nspeedily go to decay, even if it is not, at once, devoured by ravenous\r\nswarms of filthy flies and worms.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain all the important points connected with the habits\r\nof the bee-moth, I have purposely deprived colonies in some of my\r\nobserving hives, of their queen, and have thus reduced them to a state\r\nof despair, that I might closely watch all their proceedings. I have\r\ninvariably found that in this state, they have made little or no\r\nresistance to the entrance of the bee-moth, but have allowed her to\r\ndeposit her eggs, just where she pleased. The worms, after hatching,\r\nhave always appeared to be even more at home than the poor dispirited\r\nbees themselves, and have grown and thrived, in the most luxurious\r\nmanner. In some instances, these colonies, so far from losing all spirit\r\nto resent other intrusions, were positively the most vindictive set of\r\nbees in my whole Apiary. One especially, assaulted every body that came\r\nnear it, and when reduced in numbers to a mere handful, seemed as ready\r\nfor fight as ever.\r\n\r\nHow utterly useless then, for defending a queenless colony against the\r\nmoth, are all the traps and other devices which have been, of late\r\nyears, so much relied upon. If a single female gains admission, she will\r\nlay eggs enough to destroy in a short time, the strongest colony that\r\never existed, if once it has lost its queen, and has no means of\r\nprocuring another. But not only do the bees of a hive which is\r\nhopelessly queenless, make little or no opposition to the entrance of\r\nthe bee-moth, and to the ravages of the worms, but by their forlorn\r\ncondition, they positively invite the attacks of their destroyers. The\r\nmoth seems to have an instinctive knowledge of the condition of such a\r\nhive, and no art of man can ever keep her out. She will pass by other\r\ncolonies to get at the queenless one, for she seems to know that there\r\nshe will find all the conditions that are necessary to the proper\r\ndevelopment of her young. There are many mysteries in the insect world,\r\nwhich we have not yet solved; nor can we tell just how the moth arrives\r\nat so correct a knowledge of the condition of the queenless hives in the\r\nApiary. That such hives, very seldom, maintain a guard about the\r\nentrance, is certain; and that they do not fill the air with the\r\npleasant voice of happy industry, is equally certain; for even to our\r\ndull ears, the difference between the hum of the prosperous hive, and\r\nthe unhappy note of the despairing one, is sufficiently obvious. May it\r\nnot be even more obvious to the acute senses of the provident mother,\r\nseeking a proper place for the development of her young?\r\n\r\nThe unerring sagacity of the moth, closely resembles that peculiar\r\ninstinct by which the vulture and other birds that prey upon carrion,\r\nare able to single out a diseased animal from the herd, which they\r\nfollow with their dismal croakings, hovering over its head, or sitting\r\nin ill-omened flocks, on the surrounding trees, watching it as its life\r\nebbs away, and stretching out their filthy and naked necks, and opening\r\nand snapping their blood-thirsty beaks that they may be all ready to\r\ntear out its eyes just glazing in death, and banquet upon its flesh\r\nstill warm with the blood of life! Let any fatal accident befall an\r\nanimal, and how soon will you see them, first from one quarter of the\r\nheavens, and then from another, speeding their eager flight to their\r\ndestined prey, when only a short time before, not a single one could be\r\nseen or heard.\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly seen powerful colonies speedily devoured by the worms,\r\nbecause of the loss of their queen, when they have stood, side by side\r\nwith feeble colonies which being in possession of a queen, have been\r\nleft untouched!\r\n\r\nThat the common hives furnish no available remedy for the loss of the\r\nqueen, is well known: indeed, the owner cannot, in many cases, be sure\r\nthat his bees are queenless, until their destruction is certain, while\r\nnot unfrequently, after keeping bees for many years, he does not even so\r\nmuch as believe that there is such a thing as a queen bee!\r\n\r\nIn the Chapter on the Loss of the Queen, I shall show in what way this\r\nloss can be ascertained, and ordinarily remedied, and thus the bees be\r\nprotected from that calamity which more than all others, exposes them to\r\ndestruction. When a colony has become hopelessly queenless, then moth or\r\nno moth, its destruction is absolutely certain. Even if the bees\r\nretained their wonted industry in gathering stores, and their usual\r\nenergy in defending themselves against all their enemies, their ruin\r\ncould only be delayed for a short time. In a few months, they would all\r\ndie a natural death, and there being none to replace them, the hive\r\nwould be utterly depopulated. Occasionally, such instances occur in\r\nwhich the bees have died, and large stores of honey have been found\r\nuntouched in their hives. This, however, but seldom happens: for they\r\nrarely escape from the assaults of other colonies, even if after the\r\ndeath of their queen, they do not fall a prey to the bee-moth. A\r\nmotherless hive is almost always assaulted by stronger stocks, which\r\nseem to have an instinctive knowledge of its orphanage, and hasten at\r\nonce, to take possession of its spoils. (See Remarks on Robbing.) If it\r\nescape the Scylla of these pitiless plunderers, it is soon dashed upon a\r\nmore merciless Charybdis, when the miscreant moths have ascertained its\r\ndestitution. Every year, large numbers of hives are bereft of their\r\nqueen, and every year, the most of such hives are either robbed by other\r\nbees, or sacked by the bee-moth, or first robbed, and afterwards sacked,\r\nwhile their owner imputes all the mischief that is done, to something\r\nelse than the real cause. He might just as well imagine that the birds,\r\nor the carrion worms which are devouring his dead horse, were actually\r\nthe primary cause of its untimely end. How often we see the same kind of\r\nmistake made by those who impute the decay of a tree, to the insects\r\nwhich are banqueting upon its withering foliage; when often these\r\ninsects are there, because the disease of the tree has both furnished\r\nthem with their proper aliment, and deprived the plant of the vigor\r\nnecessary to enable it to resist their attack.\r\n\r\nThe bee keeper can easily gather from these remarks, the means upon\r\nwhich I most rely, to protect my colonies from the bee-moth. Knowing\r\nthat strong stocks supplied with a fertile queen, are always able to\r\ntake care of themselves, in almost any kind of hive, I am careful to\r\nkeep them in the state which is practically found to be one of such\r\nsecurity. If they are weak, they must be properly strengthened, and\r\nconfined to only as much space as they can warm and defend: and if they\r\nare queenless, they must be supplied with the means of repairing their\r\nloss, or if that cannot be done, they should be at once broken up, (See\r\nRemarks on Queenlessness, and Union of Stocks,) and added to other\r\nstocks.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too deeply impressed upon the mind of the bee-keeper, that\r\na small colony ought always to be confined to a small space, if we wish\r\nthe bees to work with the greatest energy, and to offer the stoutest\r\nresistance to their numerous enemies. Bees do most unquestionably,\r\n\"abhor a vacuum,\" if it is one which they can neither fill, warm nor\r\ndefend. Let the prudent bee-master only keep his stocks strong, and they\r\nwill do more to defend themselves against all intruders, than he can\r\npossibly do for them, even if he spends his whole time in watching and\r\nassisting them.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary, after the preceding remarks, to say much upon\r\nthe various contrivances to which so many resort, as a safeguard against\r\nthe bee-moth. The idea that gauze-wire doors, to be shut daily at dusk,\r\nand opened again at morning, can exclude the moth, will not weigh much\r\nwith one who has seen them flying and seeking admission, especially in\r\ndull weather, long before the bees have given over their work for the\r\nday. Even if the moth could be excluded by such a contrivance, it would\r\nrequire, on the part of those who rely upon it, a regularity almost akin\r\nto that of the heavenly bodies in their courses; a regularity so\r\nsystematic, in short, as either to be impossible, or likely to be\r\nattained but by very few.\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly ingenious contrivance, to say the least, to remedy the\r\nnecessity for such close supervision, is that by which the movable doors\r\nof all the hives are governed by a long lever in the shape of a\r\nhen-roost, so that the hives may all be closed seasonably and regularly,\r\nby the crowing and cackling tribe, when they go to bed at night, and\r\nopened at once when they fly from their perch, to greet the merry morn.\r\nAlas! that so much ingenuity should be all in vain! Chickens are often\r\nsleepy, and wish to retire sometime before the bees feel that they have\r\ncompleted their full day's work, and some of them are so much opposed to\r\nearly rising, either from ill-health, or downright laziness, that they\r\nsit moping on their roost, long after the cheerful sun has purpled the\r\nglowing East. Even if this device were perfectly successful, it could\r\nnot save from ruin, a colony which has lost its queen. The truth is,\r\nthat almost all the contrivances upon which we are instructed to rely,\r\nare just about equivalent to the lock carefully put upon the stable\r\ndoor, after the horse has been stolen; or to attempts to prevent\r\ncorruption from fastening upon the body of an animal, after the breath\r\nof life has forever departed.\r\n\r\nAre there then no precautions to which we may resort, except by using\r\nhives which give the control over every comb? Certainly there are, and I\r\nshall now describe them in such a manner as to aid all who find\r\nthemselves annoyed by the inroads of the bee-moth.\r\n\r\nLet the prudent bee-master be deeply impressed with the very great\r\nimportance of destroying _early_ in the season, the larvæ of the\r\nbee-moth. \"Prevention is,\" at all times, \"better than cure\": a single\r\npair of worms that are permitted to undergo their changes into the\r\nwinged insect, may give birth to some hundreds which before the close of\r\nthe season, may fill the Apiary with thousands of their kind. The\r\ndestruction of a single worm early in the Spring, may thus be more\r\nefficacious than that of hundreds, at a later period. If the common\r\nhives are used, these worms must be sought for in their hiding places,\r\nunder the edges of the hive; or the hive may be propped up, on the two\r\nends, with strips of wood, about three eighths of an inch thick; and a\r\npiece of old woolen rag put between the bottom-board and the back of\r\nthe hive. Into this warm hiding place, the full grown worm will retreat\r\nto spin its cocoon, and it may then be very easily caught and\r\neffectually dealt with. Hollow sticks, or split joints of cane may be\r\nset under the hives, so as to elevate them, or may be laid on the\r\nbottom-board, and if they have a few small openings through which the\r\nbees cannot enter, the worms will take possession of them, and may\r\neasily be destroyed. Only provide some hollow, inaccessible to the bees,\r\nbut communicating with the hive and easily accessible to the worms when\r\nthey want to spin, and to yourself when you want them, and if the bees\r\nare in good health, so that they will not permit the worms to spin among\r\nthe combs, you can, with ease, entrap nearly all of them. If the hive\r\nhas lost its queen, and the worms have gained possession of it, you can\r\ndo nothing for it better than to break it up as soon as possible, unless\r\nyou prefer to reserve it as a moth trap to devastate your whole Apiary.\r\n\r\nI make use of blocks of a peculiar construction, in order both to entrap\r\nthe worms, and to exclude the moth from my hives. The only place where\r\nthe moth can enter, is just where the bees are going in and out, and\r\nthis passage may be contracted so as to suit the size of the colony: the\r\nvery shape of it is such that if the moth attempts to force an entrance,\r\nshe is obliged to travel over a space which is continually narrowing,\r\nand of course, is more and more easily defended by the bees. My traps\r\nare slightly elevated, so that the heat and odor of the hive pass under\r\nthem, and come out through small openings into which the moth can enter,\r\nbut which do not admit her into the hive. These openings, which are so\r\nmuch like the crevices between the common hives and their bottom-boards,\r\nthe moth will enter, rather than attempt to force her way through the\r\nguards, and finding here the nibblings and parings of comb and\r\nbee-bread, in which her young can flourish, she deposits her eggs in a\r\nplace where they may be reached and destroyed. All this is on the\r\nsupposition that the hive has a healthy queen, and that the bees are\r\nconfined to a space which they can warm and defend. If there are no\r\nguards and no resistance, or at best but a very feeble one, she will not\r\nrest in any outer chamber, but will penetrate to the very heart of the\r\ncitadel, and there deposit her seeds of mischief. These same blocks have\r\nalso grooves which communicate with the _interior_ of the hives, and\r\nwhich appear to the prowling worm in search of a comfortable nest, just\r\nthe very best possible place, so warm and snug and secure, in which to\r\nspin its web, and \"bide its time.\" When the hand of the bee-master\r\nlights upon it, doubtless it has reason to feel that it has been caught\r\nin its own craftiness.\r\n\r\nIf asked how much will such contrivances help the careless bee-man, I\r\nanswer, not one iota; nay, they will positively furnish him greater\r\nfacilities for destroying his bees. Worms will spin and hatch, and moths\r\nwill lay their eggs, under the blocks, and he will never remove them:\r\nthus instead of traps he will have most beautiful devices for giving\r\nmore effectual aid and comfort to his enemies. Such persons, if they\r\never attempt to keep bees on my plans, should use only my smooth blocks,\r\nwhich will enable them to control, at will, the size of the entrance to\r\nthe hives, and which are exceedingly important in aiding the bees to\r\ndefend themselves against moths and robbers, and all enemies which seek\r\nadmission to their castle.\r\n\r\nLet me, however, strongly advise the thoroughly and incorrigibly\r\ncareless, to have nothing to do with bees, either on my plan of\r\nmanagement, or any other; for they will find their time and money\r\nalmost certainly thrown away; unless their mishaps open their eyes to\r\nthe secret of their failure in other things, as well as in bee-keeping.\r\n\r\nIf I find that the worms, by any means have got the upper hand in one of\r\nmy hives, I take out the combs, shake off the bees, route out the worms\r\nand restore the combs again to the bees: if there is reason to fear that\r\nthey contain eggs and small worms, I smoke them thoroughly with sulphur,\r\nand air them well before they are returned. Such operations, however,\r\nwill very seldom be required. Shallow vessels containing sweetened\r\nwater, placed on the hives after sunset, will often entrap many of the\r\nmoths. Pans of milk are recommended by some as useful for this purpose.\r\nSo fond are the moths of something sweet, that I have caught them\r\n_sticking fast_ to pieces of moist sugar-candy.\r\n\r\nI cannot deny myself the pleasure of making an extract from an\r\narticle[24] from the pen of that accomplished scholar, and well-known\r\nenthusiast in bee-culture, Henry K. Oliver, Esq. \"We add a few words\r\nrespecting the enemies of bees. The mouse, the toad, the ant, the\r\nstouter spiders, the wasp, the death-head moth, (Sphinx atropos,) and\r\nall the varieties of gallinaceous birds, have, each and all, \"a sweet\r\ntooth,\" and like, very well, a dinner of raw bee. But the ravages of all\r\nthese are but a baby bite to the destruction caused by the bee-moth,\r\n(Tinea mellonella.) These nimble-footed little mischievous vermin may be\r\nseen, on any evening, from early May to October, fluttering about the\r\napiary, or running about the hives, at a speed to outstrip the swiftest\r\nbee, and endeavoring to effect an entrance into the door way, for it is\r\nwithin the hive that their instinct teaches them they must deposit their\r\neggs. You can hardly find them by day, for they are cunning and secrete\r\nthemselves. \"They love darkness rather than light, because their deeds\r\nare evil.\" They are a paltry looking, insignificant little grey-haired\r\npestilent race of wax-and-honey-eating and bee-destroying rascals, that\r\nhave baffled all contrivances that ingenuity has devised to conquer or\r\ndestroy them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your committee would be very glad indeed to be able to suggest any\r\neffectual means, by which to assist the honey-bee and its friends,\r\nagainst the inroads of this, its bitterest and most successful foe,\r\nwhose desolating ravages are more lamented and more despondingly\r\nreferred to, than those of any other enemy. Various contrivances have\r\nbeen announced, but none have proved efficacious to any full extent, and\r\nwe are compelled to say that there really is no security, except in a\r\nvery full, healthy and vigorous stock of bees, and in a very close and\r\nwell made hive, the door of which is of such dimensions of length and\r\nheight, that the nightly guards can effectually protect it. Not too long\r\na door, nor too high. If too long, the bees cannot easily guard it, and\r\nif too high, the moth will get in over the heads of the guards. If the\r\nguards catch one of them, her life is not worth insuring. But if the\r\nmoths, in any numbers, effect a lodgment in the hive, then the hive is\r\nnot worth insuring. They immediately commence laying their eggs, from\r\nwhich comes, in a few days, a brownish white caterpillar, which encloses\r\nitself, all but its head, in a silken cocoon. This head, covered with an\r\nimpenetrable coat of scaly mail, which bids defiance to the bees, is\r\nthrust forward, just outside of the silken enclosure, and the gluttonous\r\npest eats all before it, wax, pollen, and exuviæ, until ruin to the\r\nstock is inevitable. As says the Prophet Joel, speaking of the ravages\r\nof the locust, \"the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and\r\nbehind them a desolate wilderness.\" Look out, brethren, bee lovers, and\r\nhave your hives of the best unshaky, unknotty stock, with close fitting\r\njoints, and well covered with three or four coats of paint. He who shall\r\nbe successful in devising the means of ridding the bee world of this\r\ndestructive and merciless pest, will richly deserve to be crowned \"King\r\nBee,\" in perpetuity, to be entitled to a never-fading wreath of budding\r\nhoney flowers, from sweetly breathing fields, all murmuring with bees,\r\nto be privileged to use, during his natural life, \"night tapers from\r\ntheir waxen thighs,\" best wax candles, (two to the pound!) to have an\r\nannual offering from every bee-master, of ten pounds each, of very best\r\nvirgin honey, and to a body guard, for protection against all foes, of\r\nthrice ten thousand workers, all armed and equipped, as Nature's law\r\ndirects. Who shall have these high honors?\"\r\n\r\nIt might seem highly presumptuous for me, at this early date, to lay\r\nclaim to them, but I beg leave to enroll myself among the list of\r\nhonorable candidates, and I cheerfully submit my pretensions to the\r\nsuffrages of all intelligent keepers of bees.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on Requisites, I have spoken of the ravages of the mouse,\r\nand have there described the way in which my hives are guarded against\r\nits intrusion. That some kinds of birds are fond of bees, every Apiarian\r\nknows, to his cost; still, I cannot advise that any should, on this\r\naccount, be destroyed. It has been stated to me, by an intelligent\r\nobserver, that the King-bird, which devours them by scores, confines\r\nhimself always, in the season of drones, to those fat and lazy gentlemen\r\nof leisure. I fear however, that this, as the children say, \"is too good\r\nnews to be true,\" and that not only the industrious portion of the busy\r\ncommunity fall a prey to his fatal snap, but that the luxurious gourmand\r\ncan distinguish perfectly well, between an empty bee in search of food,\r\nand one which is returning full laden to its fragrant home, and whose\r\nhoney-bag sweetens the delicious tit-bit, as the crushed unfortunate,\r\nall ready sugared, glides daintily down his voracious maw! Still, I have\r\nnever yet been willing to destroy a bird, because of its fondness for\r\nbees; and I advise all lovers of bees to have nothing to do with such\r\nfoolish practices. Unless we can check among our people, the stupid, as\r\nwell as inhuman custom of destroying so wantonly, on any pretence, and\r\noften on none at all, the insectivorous birds, we shall soon, not only\r\nbe deprived of their aerial melody, among the leafy branches, but shall\r\nlament over the ever increasing horde of destructive insects, which\r\nravage our fields and desolate our orchards, and from whose successful\r\ninroads, nothing but the birds can ever protect us. Think of it, ye who\r\ncan enjoy no music made by these winged choristers of the skies, except\r\nthat of their agonizing screams, as they fall before your well-aimed\r\nweapons, and flutter out their innocent lives before your heartless\r\ngaze! Drive away as fast and as far as you please, from your cruel\r\npremises, all the little birds that you cannot destroy, and then find,\r\nif you can, those who will sympathize with you, when the caterpillars\r\nweave their destroying webs over your leafless trees, and insects of all\r\nkinds riot in glee, upon your blasted harvests! I hope that such a\r\nhealthy public opinion will soon prevail, that the man or boy who is\r\narmed with a gun to shoot the little birds, will be scouted from all\r\nhumane and civilized society, and if he should be caught about such\r\ncontemptible business, will be too much ashamed even to look an honest\r\nman in the face. I shall close what I have to say about the birds, with\r\nthe following beautiful translation of an old Greek poet's address to\r\nthe swallow.\r\n\r\n    \"Attic maiden, honey fed,\r\n      Chirping warbler, bear'st away,\r\n    Thou the busy buzzing bee,\r\n      To thy callow brood a prey?\r\n    Warbler, thou a warbler seize?\r\n      Winged, one with lovely wings?\r\n    Guest thyself, by Summer brought,\r\n      Yellow guest whom Summer brings?\r\n    Wilt not quickly let it drop?\r\n      'Tis not fair, indeed 'tis wrong,\r\n    That the ceaseless warbler should\r\n      Die by mouth of ceaseless song.\"\r\n                    _Merivale's Translation._\r\n\r\nI have not the space to speak at length of the other enemies of the\r\nhonied race: nor indeed is it at all necessary. If the Apiarian only\r\nsucceeds in keeping his stocks strong, they will be their own best\r\nprotectors, and if he does not succeed in this, they would be of little\r\nvalue, even if they had no enemies ever vigilant, to watch for their\r\nhalting. Nations which are both rich and feeble, invite attack, as well\r\nas unfit themselves for vigorous resistance. Just so with the\r\ncommonwealth of bees. Unless amply guarded by thousands ready to die in\r\nits defence, it is ever liable to fall a prey to some one of its many\r\nenemies, which are all agreed in this one opinion, at least, that stolen\r\nhoney is much more sweet than the slow accumulations of patient\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nIn the Chapters on Protection and Ventilation, I have spoken of the\r\nfatal effects of dysentery. This disease can always be prevented by\r\nproper caution on the part of the bee-keeper. Let him be careful not to\r\nfeed his bees, late in the season, on liquid honey, (see Chapter on\r\nFeeding,) and let him keep them in dry and thoroughly protected hives.\r\nIf his situation is at all damp, and there is danger that water will\r\nsettle under his Protector, let him build it entirely _above ground_;\r\notherwise it may be as bad as a damp cellar, and incomparably worse than\r\nnothing at all.\r\n\r\nThere is one disease, called by the Germans, \"foul brood,\" of which I\r\nknow nothing, by my own observation, but which is, of all others, the\r\nmost fatal in its effects. The brood appear to die in the cells, after\r\nthey are sealed over by the bees, and the stench from their decaying\r\nbodies infects the hive, and seems to paralyze the bees. This disease\r\nis, in two instances, attributed by Dzierzon, to feeding bees on\r\n\"American Honey,\" or, as we call it, Southern Honey, which is brought\r\nfrom Cuba, and other West India Islands. That such honey is not\r\nordinarily poisonous, is well known: probably that used by him, was\r\ntaken from diseased colonies. It is well known that if any honey or\r\ncombs are taken from a hive in which this pestilence is raging, it will\r\nmost surely infect the colonies to which they may be given. No foreign\r\nhoney ought therefore to be extensively used, until its quality has been\r\nthoroughly tested. The extreme violence of this disease may be inferred\r\nfrom the fact, that Dzierzon in one season, lost by it, between four and\r\nfive hundred colonies! As at present advised, if my colonies were\r\nattacked by it, I should burn up the bees, combs, honey, frames, and\r\nall, from every diseased hive; and then thoroughly scald and smoke with\r\nsulphur, all such hives, and replenish them with bees from a healthy\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiar kind of dysentery which does not seem to affect a\r\nwhole colony, but confines its ravages to a small number of the bees. In\r\nthe early stages of this disease, those attacked are excessively\r\nirritable, and will attempt to sting any one who comes near the hives.\r\nIf dissected, their stomachs are found to be already discolored by the\r\ndisease. In the latter stages of this complaint, they not only lose all\r\ntheir irascibility, but seem very stupid, and may often be seen crawling\r\nupon the ground unable to fly. Their abdomens are now unnaturally\r\nswollen, and of a much lighter color than usual, owing to their being\r\nfilled with a yellow matter exceedingly offensive to the smell. I have\r\nnot yet ascertained the cause of this disease.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Bevan.\r\n\r\n[22] Bevan.\r\n\r\n[23] A bee, a few days after it is hatched, is as fully competent for\r\nall its duties, as it ever will be, at any subsequent period of its\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[24] Report on bees to the Essex County Agricultural Society, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nLOSS OF THE QUEEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the queen of a hive is often lost, and that the ruin of the whole\r\ncolony soon follows, unless such a loss is seasonably remedied, are\r\nfacts which ought to be well known to every observing bee-keeper.\r\n\r\nSome queens appear to die of old age or disease, and at a time when\r\nthere are no worker-eggs, or larvæ of a suitable age, to enable the bees\r\nto supply their loss. It is evident, however, that no very large\r\nproportion of the queens which perish, are lost under such\r\ncircumstances. Either the bees are aware of the approaching end of their\r\naged mother, and take seasonable precautions to rear a successor; or\r\nelse she dies very suddenly, so as to leave behind her, brood of a\r\nsuitable age. It is seldom that a queen in a hive that is strong in\r\nnumbers and stores, dies either at a period of the year when there is no\r\nbrood from which another can be reared, or when there are no drones to\r\nimpregnate the one reared in her place. In speaking of the age of bees,\r\nit has already been stated that queens commonly die in their fourth\r\nyear, while none of the workers live to be a year old. Not only is the\r\nqueen much longer lived than the other bees, but she seems to be\r\npossessed of greater tenacity of life, so that when any disease\r\novertakes the colony, she is usually among the last to perish. By a most\r\nadmirable provision, their death ordinarily takes place under\r\ncircumstances the most favorable to their bereaved family. If it were\r\notherwise, the number of colonies which would annually perish, would be\r\nvery much greater than it now is; for as a number of superannuated\r\nqueens must die every year, many, or even most of them might die at a\r\nseason when their loss would necessarily involve the ruin of their whole\r\ncolony. In non-swarming hives, I have found cells in which queens were\r\nreared, not to lead out a new swarm, but to supply the place of the old\r\none which had died in the hive. There are a few well authenticated\r\ninstances, in which a young queen has been matured before the death of\r\nthe old one, but after she had become quite aged and infirm. Still,\r\nthere are cases where old queens die, either so suddenly as to leave no\r\nyoung brood behind them, or at a season when there are no drones to\r\nimpregnate the young queens.\r\n\r\nThat queens occasionally live to such an age as to become incapable of\r\nlaying worker eggs, is now a well established fact. The seminal\r\nreservoir sometimes becomes exhausted, before the queen dies of old age,\r\nand as it is never replenished, (see p. 44,) she can only lay\r\nunimpregnated eggs, or such as produce drones instead of workers. This\r\nis an additional confirmation of the theory first propounded by\r\nDzierzon. I am indebted to Mr. Wagner for the following facts. \"In the\r\nBienenzeitung, for August, 1852, Count Stosch gives us the case of a\r\ncolony examined by himself, with the aid of an experienced Apiarian, on\r\nthe 14th of April, previous. The worker-brood was then found to be\r\nhealthy. In May following, the bees worked industriously, and built new\r\ncomb. Soon afterwards they ceased to build, and appeared dispirited; and\r\nwhen, in the beginning of June, he examined the colony again, he found\r\nplenty of drone brood in worker cells! The queen appeared weak and\r\nlanguid. He confined her in a queen cage, and left her in the hive. The\r\nbees clustered around the cage; but next morning the queen was found to\r\nbe dead. Here we seem to have the commencement, progress and termination\r\nof super-annuation, all in the space of five or six weeks.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of the year, as soon as the bees begin to fly, if their\r\nmotions are carefully watched, the Apiarian may even in the common\r\nhives, generally ascertain from their actions, whether they are in\r\npossession of a fertile queen. If they are seen to bring in bee-bread\r\nwith great eagerness, it follows, as a matter of course, that they have\r\nbrood, and are anxious to obtain fresh food for its nourishment. If any\r\nhive does not industriously gather pollen, or accept the rye flour upon\r\nwhich the others are feasting, then there is an almost absolute\r\ncertainty either that it has not a queen, or that she is not fertile, or\r\nthat the hive is seriously infested with worms, or that it is on the\r\nvery verge of starvation. An experienced eye will decide upon the\r\nqueenlessness, (to use the German term,) of a hive, from the restless\r\nappearance of the bees. At this period of the year when they first\r\nrealize the magnitude of their loss, and before they have become in a\r\nmanner either reconciled to it, or indifferent to their fate, they roam\r\nin an inquiring manner, in and out of the hive, and over its outside as\r\nwell as inside, and plainly manifest that something calamitous has\r\nbefallen them. Often those that return from the fields, instead of\r\nentering the hive with that dispatchful haste so characteristic of a bee\r\nreturning well stored to a prosperous home, linger about the entrance\r\nwith an idle and very dissatisfied appearance, and the colony is\r\nrestless, long after the other stocks are quiet. Their home, like that\r\nof the man who is cursed rather than blessed in his domestic relations,\r\nis a melancholy place: and they only enter it with reluctant and\r\nslow-moving steps!\r\n\r\nIf I could address a friendly word of advice to every married woman, I\r\nwould say, \"Do all that you can to make your husband's home a place of\r\nattraction. When absent from it, let his heart glow at the very thought\r\nof returning to its dear enjoyments; and let his countenance\r\ninvoluntarily put on a more cheerful look, and his joy-quickened steps\r\nproclaim, as he is approaching, that he feels in his \"heart of hearts,\"\r\nthat \"there is no place like home.\" Let her whom he has chosen as a wife\r\nand companion, be the happy and honored Queen in his cheerful\r\nhabitation: let her be the center and soul about which his best\r\naffections shall ever revolve. I know that there are brutes in the guise\r\nof men, upon whom all the winning attractions of a prudent, virtuous\r\nwife, make little or no impression. Alas that it should be so! but who\r\ncan tell how many, even of the most hopeless cases, have been saved for\r\ntwo worlds, by a union with a virtuous woman, in whose \"tongue was the\r\nlaw of kindness,\" and of whom it could be said, \"the heart of her\r\nhusband doth safely trust in her,\" for \"she will do him good and not\r\nevil, all the days of her life.\"\r\n\r\nSaid a man of large experience, \"I scarcely know a woman who has an\r\nintemperate husband, who did not either marry a man whose habits were\r\nalready bad, or who did not drive her husband to evil courses, (often\r\nwhen such a calamitous result was the furthest possible from her\r\nthoughts or wishes,) by making him feel that he had no happy home.\"\r\nThink of it, ye who find that home is not full of dear delights, as well\r\nto yourselves, as to your affectionate husbands! Try how much virtue\r\nthere may be in winning words and happy smiles, and the cheerful\r\ndischarge of household duties, and prove the utmost possible efficacy of\r\nlove and faith and prayer, before those words of fearful agony are\r\nextorted from your despairing lips,\r\n\r\n    \"Anywhere, anywhere\r\n    Out of the world;\"\r\n\r\nwhen amid tears and sighs of inexpressible agony, you settle down into\r\nthe heart-breaking conviction that you can have no home until you have\r\npassed into that habitation not fashioned by human hands, or inhabited\r\nby human hearts!\r\n\r\nIs there any husband who can resist all the sweet attractions of a\r\nlovely wife? who does not set a priceless value upon the very gem of his\r\nlife?\r\n\r\n    \"If such there be, go mark him well;\r\n    High though his titles, proud his fame,\r\n    Boundless his wealth as wish can claim,\r\n    The wretch, concentered all in self,\r\n    Living, shall forfeit fair renown,\r\n    And doubly dying, shall go down\r\n    To the vile dust from whence he sprung\r\n    Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.\"--_Scott._\r\n\r\nI trust my readers, remembering my profession, will pardon this long\r\ndigression to which I felt myself irresistibly impelled.\r\n\r\nWhen the bees commence their work in the Spring, they give, as\r\npreviously stated, reliable evidence either that all is well, or that\r\nruin lurks within. In the common hives however, it is not always easy to\r\ndecide upon their real condition. The queenless ones do not, in all\r\ncases, disclose their misfortune, any more than all unhappy husbands or\r\nwives see fit to proclaim the full extent of their domestic\r\nwretchedness: there is a vast amount of _seeming_ even in the little\r\nworld of the bee-hive. One great advantage in my mode of construction is\r\nthat I am never obliged to leave anything to vague conjecture; but I\r\ncan, in a few moments, open the interior, and know precisely what is the\r\nreal condition of the bees.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion I found that a colony which had been queenless for a\r\nconsiderable time, utterly refused to raise another, and devoured all\r\nthe eggs which were given to them for that purpose! This colony was\r\nafterwards supplied with an unimpregnated queen, but they refused to\r\naccept of her, and attempted at once to smother her to death. I then\r\ngave them a fertile queen, but she met with no better treatment. Facts\r\nof a similar kind have been noticed, by other observers: thus it seems\r\nthat bees may not only become reconciled, as it were, to living without\r\na mother, but may pass into such an unnatural state as not only to\r\ndecline to provide themselves with another, but actually to refuse to\r\naccept of one by whose agency they might be rescued from impending ruin!\r\nBefore expressing too much astonishment at such foolish conduct, let us\r\nseriously inquire if it has not often an exact parallel in our obstinate\r\nrejection of the provisions which God has made in the Gospel for our\r\nmoral and religious welfare.\r\n\r\nIf a colony which refuses to rear another queen, has a range of comb\r\ngiven to it containing maturing brood, these poor motherless innocents,\r\nas soon as they are able to work, perceive their loss, and will proceed\r\nat once, if they have the means, to supply it! They have not yet grown\r\nso hardened by habit to unnatural and ruinous courses, as not to feel\r\nthat something absolutely indispensable to their safety is wanting in\r\ntheir hive.\r\n\r\nA word to the young who may read this treatise. Although enjoined to\r\n\"remember your Creator in the days of your youth,\" you are constantly\r\ntempted to neglect your religious duties, and to procrastinate their\r\nperformance until some more convenient season. Like the old bees in a\r\nhive without a queen, that seek only their present enjoyment, forgetful\r\nof the ruin which must surely overtake them, so you may find that when\r\nmanhood and old age arrive, you will have even less disposition to love\r\nand serve the Lord than you now have. The fetters which bind you to\r\nsinful habits will have strengthened with years until you find both the\r\ninclination and ability to break them continually decreasing.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring, as soon as the weather becomes sufficiently pleasant, I\r\ncarefully examine all the hives which do not present the most\r\nunmistakable evidences of health and vigor. If a queen is wanting, I at\r\nonce, if the colony is small, break it up, and add the bees to another\r\nstock. If however, the colony should be very large, I sometimes join to\r\nit one of my small stocks which has a healthy queen. It may be asked why\r\nnot supply the queenless stock with the means of raising another? Simply\r\nbecause there would be no drones to impregnate her, in season; and the\r\nwhole operation would therefore result in an entire failure. Why not\r\nendeavor then to preserve it, until the season for drones approaches,\r\nand then give it a queen? Because it is in danger of being robbed or\r\ndestroyed by the moth, while the bees, if added to another stock, can do\r\nme far more service than they could, if left to idleness in their old\r\nhive. It must be remembered that I am not like the bee-keepers on the\r\nold plan, extremely anxious to save every colony, however feeble: as I\r\ncan, at the proper season, form as many as I want, and with far less\r\ntrouble and expense than are required to make anything out of such\r\ndiscouraged stocks.\r\n\r\nIf any of my colonies are found to be feeble in the Spring, but yet in\r\npossession of a healthy queen, I help them to combs containing maturing\r\nbrood, in the manner already described. In short, I ascertain, at the\r\nopening of the season, the exact condition of all my stock, and apply\r\nsuch remedies as I find to be needed, giving to some, maturing brood, to\r\nothers honey, and breaking up all whose condition appears to admit of\r\nno remedy. If however, the bees have not been multiplied too rapidly,\r\nand proper care was taken to winter none but strong stocks, they will\r\nneed but little assistance in the Spring; and nearly all of them will\r\nshow indubitable signs of health and vigor.\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend every prudent bee-keeper who uses my hives, to give\r\nthem all a most thorough over-hauling and cleansing, soon after the bees\r\nbegin to work in the Spring. The bees of any stock may, with their\r\ncombs, &c., all be transferred, in a few minutes, to a clean hive; and\r\ntheir hive, after being thoroughly cleansed, may be used for another\r\ntransferred stock; and in this way, with one spare hive, the bees may\r\nall be lodged in habitations from which every speck of dirt has been\r\nremoved. They will thus have hives which can by no possibility, harbor\r\nany of the eggs, or larvæ of the moth, and which may be made perfectly\r\nfree from the least smell of must or mould or anything offensive to the\r\ndelicate senses of the bees. In making this thorough cleansing of all\r\nthe hives, the Apiarian will necessarily gain an exact knowledge of the\r\ntrue condition of each stock, and will know which have spare honey, and\r\nwhich require food: in short, which are in need of help in any respect,\r\nand which have the requisite strength to lend a helping hand to others.\r\nIf any hive needs repairing, it may be put into perfect order, before it\r\nis used again. Hives managed in this fashion, if the roofs and outside\r\ncovers are occasionally painted anew, will last for generations, and\r\nwill be found, on the score of cheapness, preferable, in the long run,\r\nto any other kind. But I ought to beg pardon of the Genius of American\r\ncheapness, who so kindly presides over the making of most of our\r\nmanufactures, and under whose shrewd tuition we are fast beginning to\r\nbelieve that cheapness in the first cost of an article, is the main\r\npoint to which our attention should be directed!\r\n\r\nLet us to be sure, save all that we can in the cost of construction, by\r\nthe greatest economy in the use of materials; let us compel every minute\r\nto yield the greatest possible practical result, by the employment of\r\nthe most skillful workmen and the most ingenious machinery; but do let\r\nus learn that slighting an article, so as to get up a mere sham, having\r\nall the appearance of reality, with none of the substance, is the\r\npoorest possible kind of pretended economy; to say nothing of the\r\ntendency of such a system, to encourage in all the pursuits of life, the\r\nnarrow and selfish policy of doing nothing thoroughly, but everything\r\nwith reference to mere outside show, or the urgent necessities of the\r\npresent moment.\r\n\r\nWe have yet to describe under what circumstances, by far the larger\r\nproportion of hives, become queenless. After the first swarm has gone\r\nout with the old mother, then both the parent stock and all the\r\nsubsequent swarms, will have each a young queen which must always leave\r\nthe hive in order to be impregnated. It sometimes happens that the wings\r\nof the young female are, from her birth, so imperfect that she either\r\nrefuses to sally out, or is unable to return to the hive, if she\r\nventures abroad. In either case, the old stock must, if left to its own\r\nresources, speedily perish. Queens, in their contests with each other,\r\nare sometimes so much crippled as to unfit them for flight, and\r\nsometimes they are disabled by the rude treatment of the bees, who\r\ninsist on driving them away from the royal cells. The great majority,\r\nhowever, of queens which are lost, perish when they leave the hive in\r\nsearch of the drones. Their _extra size_ and _slower flight_ make them a\r\nmost tempting prey to the birds, ever on the watch in the vicinity of\r\nthe hives; and many in this way, perish. Others are destroyed by sudden\r\ngusts of winds, which dash them against some hard object, or blow them\r\ninto the water; for queens are by no means, exempt from the misfortunes\r\ncommon to the humblest of their race. Very frequently, in spite of all\r\ntheir caution in noticing the position and appearance of their\r\nhabitation, before they left it, they make a fatal mistake on their\r\nreturn, and are imprisoned and destroyed as they attempt to enter the\r\nwrong hive. The precautions which should be used, to prevent such a\r\ncalamity, have been already described. If these are neglected, those who\r\nbuild their hives of uniform size and appearance, will find themselves\r\nlosing many more queens than the person who uses the old-fashioned\r\nboxes, hardly any two of which look just alike.\r\n\r\nThe bees seem to me, to have, as it were, an instinctive perception of\r\nthe dangers which await their new queen when she makes her excursion in\r\nsearch of the drones, and often gather around her, and confine her, as\r\nthough they could not bear to have her leave! I have repeatedly noticed\r\nthem doing this, although I cannot affirm with positive certainty, why\r\nthey do it. They are usually excessively agitated when the queen leaves,\r\nand often exhibit all the appearance of swarming. If the queen of an old\r\nstock is lost in this way, her colony will gradually dwindle away. If\r\nthe queen of an after-swarm fails to return, the bees very speedily come\r\nto nothing, if they remain in the hive; as a general rule, however, they\r\nsoon leave and attempt to add themselves to other colonies.\r\n\r\nIt would be highly interesting to ascertain in what way the bees become\r\ninformed of the loss of their queen. When she is taken from them under\r\nsuch circumstances as to excite the whole colony, then we can easily see\r\nhow they find out that she is gone; for when greatly excited, they\r\nalways seek first to assure themselves of her safety; just as a tender\r\nmother in time of danger forgets herself in her anxiety for her\r\nhelpless children! If however, the queen is carefully removed, so that\r\nthe colony is not disturbed, it is sometimes a day, or even more, before\r\nthey realize their loss. How do they first become aware of it? Perhaps\r\nsome dutiful bee feels that it is a long time since it has seen its\r\nmother, and anxious to embrace her, makes diligent search for her\r\nthrough the hive! The intelligence that she cannot anywhere be found, is\r\nsoon noised abroad, and the whole community are at once alarmed. At such\r\ntimes, instead of calmly conversing by merely touching each other's\r\nantennæ, they may be seen violently striking as it were, their antennæ\r\ntogether, and by the most impassioned demonstrations manifesting their\r\nagony and despair. I once removed a queen in such a manner as to cause\r\nthe bees to take wing and fill the air in search of her. She was\r\nreturned in a few minutes, and yet, on examining the colony, two days\r\nafter, I found that they had actually commenced the building of royal\r\ncells, in order to raise another! The queen was unhurt and the cells\r\nwere not tenanted. Was this work begun by some that refused for a long\r\ntime to believe the others, when told that she was safe? Or was it begun\r\nfrom the apprehension that she might again be removed?\r\n\r\nEvery colony which has a new queen, should be watched, in order that the\r\nApiarian may be seasonably apprised of her loss. The restless conduct of\r\nthe bees, on the evening of the day that she fails to return, will at\r\nonce inform the experienced bee-master of the accident which has\r\nbefallen his hive. If the bees cannot be supplied with another queen, or\r\nwith the means of raising one, if an old swarm it must be broken up, and\r\nthe bees added to another stock; if a new swarm it must always be broken\r\nup, unless it can be supplied with a queen nearly mature, or else they\r\nwill build combs unfit for the rearing of workers. By the use of my\r\nmovable comb hives, all these operations can be easily performed. If any\r\nhives have lost their young queen, they may be supplied, either with the\r\nmeans of raising another, or with sealed queens from other hives, or,\r\n(if the plan is found to answer,) with mature ones from the \"Nursery.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of precaution, I generally give to all my stocks that are\r\nraising young queens, or which have unimpregnated ones, a range of comb\r\ncontaining brood and eggs, so that they may, in case of any accident to\r\ntheir queen, proceed at once, to supply their loss. In this way, I\r\nprevent them from being so dissatisfied as to leave the hive.\r\n\r\nAbout a week after the young queens have hatched, I examine all the\r\nhives which contain them, lifting out usually, some of the largest\r\ncombs, and those which ought to contain brood. If I find a comb which\r\nhas eggs or larvæ, I am satisfied that they have a fertile queen, and\r\nshut up the hive; unless I wish to find her, in order to deprive her of\r\nher wings, (see p. 203.) I can thus often satisfy myself in one or two\r\nminutes. If no brood is found, I suspect that the queen has been lost,\r\nor that she has some defect which has prevented her from leaving the\r\nhive. If the brood-comb which I put into the hive, contains any\r\nnewly-formed royal cells, I _know_, without any further examination,\r\nthat the queen has been lost. If the weather has been unfavorable, or\r\nthe colony is quite weak, the young queen is sometimes not impregnated\r\nas early as usual, and an allowance of a few days must be made on this\r\naccount. If the weather is favorable, and the colony a good one, the\r\nqueen usually leaves, the day after she finds herself mistress of a\r\nfamily. In about two days more, she begins to lay her eggs. By waiting\r\nabout a week before the examination is made, ample allowance, in most\r\ncases, is made.\r\n\r\nEarly in the month of September, I examine carefully all my hives, so as\r\nto see that in every respect, they are in suitable condition for\r\nwintering. If any need feeding, (See Chapter on Feeding,) they are fed\r\nat this time. If any have more vacant room than they ought to have, I\r\npartition off that part of the hive which they do not need. I always\r\nexpect to find some brood in every healthy hive at this time, and if in\r\nany hive I find none, and ascertain that it is queenless, I either at\r\nonce break it up, or if it is strong in numbers supply it with a queen,\r\nby adding to it some feebler stock. If bees, however, are properly\r\nattended to, at the season when their young queens are impregnated, it\r\nwill be a very rare occurrence to find a queenless colony in the Fall.\r\n\r\nThe practical bee-keeper without further directions, will readily\r\nperceive how any operation, which in the common hives, is performed with\r\ndifficulty, if it can be performed at all, is reduced to simplicity and\r\ncertainty, by the control of the combs. If however, bee-keepers will be\r\nnegligent and ignorant, no hive can possible make them very successful.\r\nIf they belong to the fraternity of \"no eyes,\" who have kept bees all\r\ntheir lives, and do not know that there is a queen, they will probably\r\nderive no special pleasure from being compelled to believe what they\r\nhave always derided as humbug or book-knowledge; although I have seen\r\nsome bee-keepers very intelligent on most matters, who never seem to\r\nhave learned the first rudiments in the natural history of the bee.\r\nThose who cannot, or will not learn for themselves, or who have not the\r\nleisure or disposition to manage their own bees, may yet with my hives,\r\nentrust their care to suitable persons who may, at the proper time,\r\nattend to all their wants. Practical gardeners may find the management\r\nof bees for their employers, to be quite a lucrative part of their\r\nprofession. With but little extra labor and with great certainty, they\r\nmay, from time to time, do all that the prosperity of the bees require;\r\ncarefully over-hauling them in the Spring, making new colonies, at the\r\nsuitable period, if any are wanted, giving them their surplus honey\r\nreceptacles, and removing them when full; and on the approach of Winter,\r\nputting all the colonies into proper condition, to resist its rigors.\r\nThe business of the practical Apiarian, and that of the Gardener, seem\r\nvery naturally to go together, and one great advantage of my hive and\r\nmode of management is the ease with which they may be successfully\r\nunited.\r\n\r\nSome Apiarians after all that has been said, may still have doubts\r\nwhether the young queens leave the hive for impregnation; or may think\r\nthat the old ones occasionally leave, even when they do not go out to\r\nlead a swarm. Such persons may, if they choose, easily convince\r\nthemselves by the following experiments of the accuracy of my\r\nstatements. About a week after hiving a second swarm, or after the birth\r\nof a young queen in a hive, and after she has begun to lay eggs, open\r\nthe hive and remove her: carry her a few rods in front of the Apiary,\r\nand let her fly; she will at once enter her own hive and thus show that\r\nshe has previously left it. If, however, an old queen is removed a short\r\ntime after hiving the swarm, she will not be able to distinguish her own\r\nhive from any other, and will thus show that she has not left it, since\r\nthe swarm was hived. If this experiment is performed upon an old queen,\r\nin a hive in which she was put the year before, when unimpregnated, the\r\nsame result will follow; for as she never left it after that event, she\r\nwill have lost all recollection of its relative position in the Apiary.\r\nThe first of these experiments has been suggested by Dzierzon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nUNION OF STOCKS. TRANSFERRING BEES FROM THE COMMON HIVE. STARTING AN\r\nAPIARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrequent allusions have been made to the importance, for various\r\nreasons, of breaking up stocks and uniting them to other families in the\r\nApiary. Colonies which in the early Spring, are found to be queenless,\r\nought at once to be managed in this way, for even if not speedily\r\ndestroyed by their enemies, they are only consumers of the stores which\r\nthey gathered in their happier days. The same treatment should also be\r\nextended to all that in the Fall, are found to be in a similar\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAs small colonies, even though possessed of a healthy queen, are never\r\nable to winter as advantageously as large ones, the bees from several\r\nsuch colonies ought to be put together, to enable them by keeping up the\r\nnecessary supply of heat, to survive the Winter on a smaller supply of\r\nfood. A certain quantity of animal heat must be maintained by bees, in\r\norder to live at all, and if their numbers are too small, they can only\r\nkeep it up, by eating more than they would otherwise require. A small\r\nswarm will thus not unfrequently, consume as much honey as one\r\ncontaining two or three times as many bees. These are facts which have\r\nbeen most thoroughly tested on a very large scale. If a hundred persons\r\nare required to occupy, with comfort, a church that is capable of\r\naccommodating a thousand, as much fuel or even more will be required,\r\nto warm the small number as the large one.\r\n\r\nIf the stocks which are to be wintered, are in the common hives, the\r\ncondemned ones must be drummed out of their old encampment, sprinkled\r\nwith sugar-water scented with peppermint, or some other pleasant odor,\r\nand added to the others, (see p. 212.) The colonies which are to be\r\nunited ought if possible, to stand side by side, some time before this\r\nprocess is attempted. This can almost always be effected by a little\r\nmanagement, for while it would not be safe to move a colony all at once,\r\neven a few yards to the right or left of the line of flight in which\r\nthe bees sally out to the fields, (especially if other hives are near,)\r\nthey may be moved a slight distance one day, and a little more the next,\r\nand so on, until we have them at last in the desired place.\r\n\r\nAs persons may sometimes be obliged to move their Apiaries, during the\r\nworking season, I will here describe the way by which I was able to\r\naccomplish such a removal, so as to benefit, instead of injuring my\r\nbees. Selecting a pleasant day, I moved, early in the morning, a portion\r\nof my very best stocks. A considerable number of bees from these\r\ncolonies, returned in the course of the day to the familiar spot; after\r\nflying about for some time, in search of their hives, (if the weather\r\nhad been chilly many of them would have perished,) they at length\r\nentered those standing next to their old homes. More of the strongest\r\nwere removed, on the next pleasant day: and this process was repeated,\r\nuntil at last only one hive was left in the old Apiary. This was then\r\nremoved, and only a few bees returned to the old spot. I thus lost no\r\nmore bees, in moving a number of hives, than I should have lost in\r\nmoving one: and I conducted the process in such a way, as to strengthen\r\nsome of my feeble stocks, instead of very seriously diminishing their\r\nscanty numbers. I have known the most serious losses to result from the\r\nremoval of an Apiary, conducted in the manner in which a change of\r\nlocation is usually made.\r\n\r\nThe process of uniting colonies in my hive, is exceedingly simple. The\r\ncombs may, after the two colonies are sprinkled, be at once lifted out\r\nfrom the one which is to be broken up, and put with all the bees upon\r\nthem, directly into the other hive. If the Apiarian judges it best to\r\nsave any of his very small colonies, he can confine them to one half or\r\none third of the central part of the hive, and fill the two empty ends\r\nwith straw, shavings, or any good non-conductor. Any one of my frames,\r\ncan, in a few minutes, by having tacked to it a thin piece of board or\r\npaste-board, or even an old newspaper, be fashioned into a divider,\r\nwhich will answer all practical purposes, and if it is stuffed with\r\ncotton waste, &c., it will keep the bees uncommonly warm. If a _very_\r\nsmall colony is to be preserved over Winter, the queen must be confined,\r\nin the Fall, in a queen cage, to prevent the colony from deserting the\r\nhive.\r\n\r\nI shall now show how the bee-keeper who wishes only to keep a given\r\nnumber of stocks, may do so, and yet secure from that number the largest\r\nquantity of surplus honey.\r\n\r\nIf his bees are kept in non-swarming hives, he may undoubtedly, reap a\r\nbounteous harvest from the avails of their industry. I do not however,\r\nrecommend this mode of bee-keeping as the best: still there are many so\r\nsituated that it may be much the best for them. Such persons, by using\r\nmy hives, can pursue the non-swarming plan to the best advantage. They\r\ncan by taking off the wings of their queens, be sure that their colonies\r\nwill not suddenly leave them; a casualty to which all other non-swarming\r\nhives are sometimes liable; and by taking away the honey in small\r\nquantities, they will always give the bees plenty of spare room for\r\nstorage, and yet avoid discouraging them, as is so often done when large\r\nboxes are taken from them. (See Chapter on Honey.)\r\n\r\nBy removing from time to time, the old queens, the colonies can all be\r\nkept in possession of queens, at the height of their fertility, and in\r\nthis way a very serious objection to the non-swarming, or as it is\r\nfrequently called, the storifying system, may be avoided. If at any\r\ntime, new colonies are wanted, they may be made in the manner already\r\ndescribed. In districts where the honey harvest is of very short\r\ncontinuance, the non-swarming plan may be found to yield the largest\r\nquantity of honey, and in case the season should prove unfavorable for\r\nthe gathering of honey, it will usually secure the largest returns from\r\na given number of stocks. I therefore prefer to keep a considerable\r\nnumber of my colonies, on the storifying plan, and am confident of\r\nsecuring from them, a good yield of honey, even in the most unfavorable\r\nseasons. If bee-keepers will pursue the same system, they will not only\r\nbe on the safe side, but will be able to determine which method it will\r\nbe best for them to adopt, in order to make the most from their bees. As\r\na general rule, the Apiarian who increases the number of his colonies,\r\none third in a season, making one very powerful swarm from two, (See p.\r\n211,) will have more surplus honey from the three, than he could have\r\nobtained from the two, to say nothing of the value of his new swarms.\r\nIf, at the approach of Winter, he wishes to reduce his stocks down to\r\nthe Spring number, he may unite them in the manner described,\r\nappropriating all the good honey of those which he breaks up, and saving\r\nall their empty comb for the new colonies of the next season. The bees\r\nin the doubled stock will winter most admirably; will consume but\r\nlittle honey, in proportion to their numbers, and will be in most\r\nexcellent condition when the Spring opens. It must not, however, be\r\nforgotten, that although they eat comparatively little in the Winter,\r\nthey must be well supplied in the Spring; as they will then have a very\r\nlarge number of mouths to feed, to say nothing of the thousands of young\r\nbees bred in the hive. If any old-fashioned bee-keeper wishes, he can\r\nthus pursue the old plan, with only this modification; that he preserves\r\nthe lives of the bees in the hives which he wishes to take up; secures\r\nhis honey without any fumes of sulphur, and saves the empty comb to make\r\nit worth nearly ten times as much to himself, as it would be, if melted\r\ninto wax. Let no humane bee-keeper ever feel that there is the slightest\r\nnecessity for so managing his bees as to make the comparison of\r\nShakespeare always apposite:\r\n\r\n    \"When like the Bee, tolling from every flower\r\n    The virtuous sweets;\r\n    Our thighs packed with wax, our mouths, with honey,\r\n    We bring it to the hive; and like the bees,\r\n    Are murdered for our pains.\"\r\n\r\nWhile I am an advocate for breaking up all stocks which cannot be\r\nwintered advantageously, I never advise that a single bee should be\r\nkilled. Self interest and Christianity alike forbid the unnecessary\r\nsacrifice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSFERRING BEES FROM THE COMMON HIVE TO THE MOVABLE COMB HIVE.\r\n\r\nThe construction of my hive is such, as to permit me to transfer bees\r\nfrom the common hives, during all the season that the weather is warm\r\nenough to permit them to fly; and yet to be able to guarantee that they\r\nwill receive no serious damage by the change.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November, 1852, in the latitude of Northern\r\nMassachusetts, I transferred a colony which wintered in good health, and\r\nwhich now, May, 1853, promises to make an excellent stock. The day was\r\nwarm, but after the operation was completed, the weather suddenly became\r\ncold, and as the bees were not able to leave the hive in order to obtain\r\nthe water necessary for repairing their comb, they were supplied with\r\nthat indispensable article. They went to work _very_ busily, and in a\r\nshort time mended up their combs and attached them firmly to the frames.\r\n\r\nThe transfer may be made of any healthy colony, and if they are strong\r\nin numbers, and the hive is well provisioned, and the weather is not too\r\ncool when the operation is attempted, they will scarcely feel the\r\nchange. If the weather should be too chilly, it will be found almost\r\nimpossible to make a colony leave its old hive, and if the combs are cut\r\nout, and the bees removed upon them, large numbers of them will take\r\nwing, and becoming chilled, will be unable to join their companions, and\r\nso will perish.\r\n\r\nThe process of transferring bees to my hives, is performed as follows.\r\nLet the old hive be shut up and well drummed[25] and the bees, if\r\npossible, be driven into an upper box. If they will not leave the hive\r\nof their own accord, they will fill themselves, and when it is\r\nascertained that they are determined, if they can help it, not to be\r\ntenants at will, the upper box must be removed, and the bees gently\r\nsprinkled, so that they may all be sure to have nothing done to them on\r\nan empty stomach. If possible, an end of the old box parallel with the\r\ncombs, must be pried off, so that they may be easily cut out. An old\r\nhive or box should stand upon a sheet, in place of the removed stock,\r\nand as fast as a comb is cut out, the bees should be shaken from it,\r\nupon the sheet; a wing or anything soft, will often be of service in\r\nbrushing off the bees. Remember that they must not be hurt. If the\r\nweather is so pleasant that many bees from other hives, are on the wing,\r\ngreat care must be taken to prevent them from robbing. As fast therefore\r\nas the bees are shaken from the combs, these should be put into an empty\r\nhive or box, and covered with a cloth, or set in some place where they\r\nwill not be disturbed. As soon as all the combs have been removed, the\r\nApiarian should proceed to select and arrange them for his new hive. If\r\nthe transfer is made late in the season, care must be taken, of course,\r\nto give the bees combs containing a generous allowance of honey for\r\ntheir winter supplies; together with such combs as have brood, or are\r\nbest fitted for the rearing of workers. All coarse combs except such as\r\ncontain the honey which they need, should be rejected. Lay a frame upon\r\na piece of comb, and mark it so as to be able to cut it a trifle larger,\r\nso that it will just _crowd_ into the frame, to remain in its place\r\nuntil the bees have time to attach it. If the size of the combs is such,\r\nthat some of them cannot be cut so as to fit, then cut them to the best\r\nadvantage, and after putting them into the frames, wind some thread\r\naround the upper and lower slats of the frame, so as to hold the combs\r\nin their place, until the bees can fasten them. If however, any of the\r\ncombs which do not fit, have no honey in them, they may be fastened very\r\neasily, by dipping their upper edges into melted rosin. When the\r\nrequisite number of combs are put into the frames, they should be placed\r\nin the new hive, and slightly fastened on the rabbets with a mere touch\r\nof paste, so as to hold them firmly in their places; this will be the\r\nmore necessary if the transfer is made so late in the season that the\r\nbees cannot obtain the propolis necessary to fasten them, themselves.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the hive is thus prepared, let the temporary box into which\r\nthe bees have been driven, be removed, and their new home put in its\r\nplace. Shake out now the bees from the box, upon a sheet in front of\r\nthis hive, and the work is done; bees, brood, honey, bee-bread, empty\r\ncombs and all, have been nicely moved, and without any more serious loss\r\nthan is often incurred by any other moving family, which has to mourn\r\nover some broken crockery, or other damage done in the necessary work of\r\nestablishing themselves in a new home! If this operation is performed at\r\na season of the year when there is much brood in the hive, and when the\r\nweather is cool, care must be taken not to expose the brood, so that it\r\nmay become fatally chilled.\r\n\r\nThe best time for performing it, is late in the Fall, when there is but\r\nlittle brood in the hive; or about ten days after the voluntary or\r\nforced departure of a first swarm from the old stock. By this time, the\r\nbrood left by the old queen, will all be sealed over, and old enough to\r\nbear exposure, especially as the weather, at swarming time, is usually\r\nquite warm. A temperature, not lower than 70°, will do them no harm, for\r\nif exposed to such a temperature, they will hatch, even if taken from\r\nthe bees.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the _best_ time for performing this operation. It may\r\nbe done at any season of the year, when the bees can fly without any\r\ndanger of being chilled, and I should not be afraid to attempt it, in\r\nmid-winter, if the weather was as warm as it sometimes is. Let me here\r\nearnestly caution all who keep bees, against meddling with them when the\r\nweather is cool. Irreparable mischief is often done to them at such\r\ntimes; they are tempted to fly, and thus perish from the cold, and\r\nfrequently they become so much excited, that they cannot retain their\r\nfæces, but void them among the combs. If nothing worse ensues, they are\r\ndisturbed when they ought to be in almost death-like repose, and are\r\nthus tempted to eat a much larger quantity of food than they would\r\notherwise have needed. Let the Apiarian remember that not a single\r\nunnecessary motion should be required of a single bee: for all this, to\r\nsay nothing else, involves a foolish waste of food. (See p. 116.)\r\n\r\nIn all operations involving the transferring of bees, it is exceedingly\r\ndesirable that the new hives to which they are transferred should be\r\nput, as near as possible, where the old ones stood. If other colonies\r\nare in close proximity, the bees may be tempted to enter the wrong\r\nhives, if their position is changed only a little; they are almost sure\r\nto do this if the others resemble more closely than the new one, their\r\nformer habitation. If will be often advisable, to transport to the\r\ndistance of one or two miles, the stocks which are to be transferred; so\r\nthat the operation may be performed to the best advantage. In a few\r\nweeks they may be brought back to the Apiary. In hiving swarms, and\r\ntransferring stocks, care must be taken to prevent the bees from getting\r\nmixed with those of other colonies. If this precaution is neglected many\r\nbees will be lost by joining other stocks, where they may be kindly\r\nwelcomed, or may at once be put to death. It is exceedingly difficult,\r\nto tell before hand, what kind of a reception strange bees will meet\r\nwith, from a colony which they attempt to join. In the working season\r\nthey are much more likely to be well received, than at any other time,\r\nespecially if they come loaded with honey: still new swarms full of\r\nhoney, that attempt to enter other hives, are often killed at once. If a\r\ncolony which has an unimpregnated queen seeks to unite with another\r\nwhich has a fertile one, then almost as a matter of course they are\r\ndestroyed! If by moving their hive, or in any other way, bees are made\r\nto enter a hive containing an unimpregnated queen, they will often\r\ndestroy her, if they came from a family which was in possession of a\r\nfertile one! If any thing of this kind is ever attempted, the queen\r\nought first to be confined in a queen cage. If while attempting a\r\ntransfer of the bees to a new hive, I am apprehensive of robbers\r\nattacking the combs, or am pressed for want of time, I put only such\r\ncombs as contain brood into the frames, and set the others in a safe\r\nplace. The bees are now at once allowed to enter their new hive, and the\r\nother combs are given to them at a more convenient time. The whole\r\nprocess of transferal need not occupy more than an hour, and in some\r\ncases it can be done in fifteen minutes. If the weather is hot, the\r\ncombs must not be exposed at all to the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nUntil I had tested the feasibility of transferring bees from the old\r\nhives, by means of my frames, I felt strongly opposed to any attempt to\r\ndislodge them from their previous habitation. If they are transferred in\r\nthe usual way, it must be done when the combs are filled with brood; for\r\nif delayed until late in the season, they will have no time to lay in a\r\nstore of provision against the Winter. Who can look without disgust,\r\nupon the wanton destruction of thousands of their young, and the silly\r\nwaste of comb, which can be replaced only by the consumption of large\r\nquantities of honey? In the great majority of such cases, the transfer,\r\nunless made about the swarming season, and _previous_ to the issue of\r\nthe first swarm, will be an entire failure, and if made before, at best\r\nonly one colony is obtained, instead of the two, which are secured on my\r\nplan. I never advise the transfer of a colony into _any_ hive, unless\r\ntheir combs can be transferred with them, nor do I advise any except\r\npractical Apiarians, to attempt to transfer them even to my hives. But\r\nwhat if a colony is so old that its combs can only breed dwarfs? When I\r\nfind such a colony, I shall think it worth while to give specific\r\ndirections as to how it should be managed. The truth is, that of all the\r\nmany mistakes and impositions which have disgusted multitudes with the\r\nvery sound of \"patent hive,\" none has been more fatal than the notion\r\nthat an old colony of bees could not be expected to prosper. Thousands\r\nof the very best stocks have been wantonly sacrificed to this Chimera;\r\nand so long as bee-keepers instead of studying the habits of the bee,\r\nprefer to listen to the interested statements of ignorant, or\r\nenthusiastic, or fraudulent persons, thousands more will suffer the same\r\nfate. As to old stocks, the prejudice against them is just as foolish as\r\nthe silly notions of some who imagine that a woman is growing old, long\r\nbefore she has reached her prime. Many a man of mature years who has\r\nmarried a girl or a child, instead of a woman, has often had both time\r\nenough, and cause enough to lament his folly.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too strongly urged upon all who keep bees, either for love\r\nor for money, to be exceedingly cautious in trying any new hive, or new\r\nsystem of management. If you are ever so well satisfied that it will\r\nanswer all your expectations, enter upon it, at first, only on a small\r\nscale; then, if it fulfills all its promises, or if _you_ can make it do\r\nso, you may safely adopt it: at all events, you will not have to mourn\r\nover large sums of money spent for nothing, and numerous powerful\r\ncolonies entirely destroyed. \"Let well enough alone,\" should, to a great\r\nextent, be the motto of every prudent bee-keeper. There is, however, a\r\ngolden mean between that obstinate and stupid conservatism which tries\r\nnothing new, and, of course, learns nothing new, and that craving after\r\nmere novelty, and that rash experimenting on an extravagant scale, which\r\nis so characteristic of a large portion of our American people. It would\r\nbe difficult to find a better maxim than that which is ascribed to\r\nDavid Crockett; \"_Be sure you're right, then go ahead._\"\r\n\r\nWhat old bee-keeper has not had abundant proof that stocks eight or ten\r\nyears old, or even older, are often among the very best, in his whole\r\nApiary, always healthy and swarming with almost unfailing regularity! I\r\nhave seen such hives, which for more than fifteen years, have scarcely\r\nfailed, a single season, to throw a powerful swarm. I have one now ten\r\nyears old, in admirable condition, which a few years ago, swarmed three\r\ntimes, and the first swarm sent off a colony the same season. All these\r\nswarms were so early that they gathered ample supplies of honey, and\r\nwintered without any assistance!\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of old stocks flourishing for a long term of years\r\nin hives of the roughest possible construction; and I shall now in\r\naddition to my previous remarks assign a new reason for such unusual\r\nprosperity. Without a single exception, I have found one or both of two\r\nthings to be true, of every such hive. Either it was a very large hive,\r\nor else if not of unusual size, it contained a large quantity of\r\nworker-comb. No hive which does not contain a good allowance of regular\r\ncomb of a size adapted to the rearing of workers, can ever in the nature\r\nof things, prove a valuable stock hive. Many hives are so full of drone\r\ncombs that they breed a cloud of useless consumers, instead of the\r\nthousands of industrious bees which ought to have occupied their places\r\nin the combs. It frequently happens that when bees are put into a new\r\nhive, the honey-harvest is at its height, and the bees finding it\r\ndifficult to build worker comb fast enough to hold their gatherings, are\r\ntempted to construct long ranges of drone comb to receive their stores.\r\nIn this way, a hive often contains so small an allowance of\r\nworker-comb, that it can never flourish, as the bees refuse to pull\r\ndown, and build over any of their old combs. All this can be easily\r\nremedied by the use of the movable comb hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCURING BEES TO START AN APIARY.\r\n\r\nA person ignorant of bees, must depend in a very great measure, on the\r\nhonesty of those from whom he purchases them. Many stocks are not worth\r\naccepting as a gift: like a horse or cow, incurably diseased, they will\r\nonly prove a bill of vexatious expense. If an inexperienced person\r\nwishes to commence bee-keeping, I advise him, by all means, to purchase\r\na new swarm of bees. It ought to be a large and early one. Second swarms\r\nand all late and small first swarms, ought never to be purchased by one\r\nwho has no experience in Apiarian pursuits. They are very apt, in such\r\nhands, to prove a failure. If all bee-keepers were of that exemplary\r\nclass of whom the Country Curate speaks, (see p. 33,) it would be\r\nperfectly safe to order a swarm of any one keeping a stock of bees. This\r\nhowever, is so far from being true, that some offer for sale, old stocks\r\nwhich are worthless, or impose on the ignorant, small first swarms, and\r\nsecond and even third swarms, as prime swarms worth the very highest\r\nmarket price. If the novice purchases an old stock, he will have the\r\nperplexities of swarming, &c., the first season, and before he has\r\nobtained any experience. As it may, however, be sometimes advisable that\r\nthis should be done, unless he makes his purchase of a man known to be\r\nhonest, he should select his stock himself, at a period of the day when\r\nthe bees, in early Spring, are busily engaged in plying their labors. He\r\nshould purchase a colony which is very actively engaged in carrying in\r\nbee-bread, and which, from the large number going in and out,\r\nundoubtedly contains a vigorous population. The hive should be removed\r\nat an hour when the bees are all at home. It may be gently inverted, and\r\na coarse towel placed over it, and then tacked fast, when the bees are\r\nshut in. Have a steady horse, and before you start, be very sure that it\r\nis _impossible_ for any bees to get out. Place the hive on some straw,\r\nin a wagon that has easy springs, and the bees will have plenty of air,\r\nand the combs, from the inverted position of the hive, will not be so\r\nliable to be jarred loose. Never purchase a hive which contains much\r\ncomb just built; for it will be next to impossible to move it, in warm\r\nweather, without loosening the new combs. If a new swarm is purchased,\r\nit may be brought home as follows. Furnish the person on whose premises\r\nit is to be hived, with a box holding at the very least, a cubic foot of\r\nclear contents. Let the bottom-board of this temporary hive be clamped\r\non both ends, the clamps being about two inches wider than the thickness\r\nof the board, so that when the hive is set on the bottom-board, it will\r\nslip in between the upper projections of the clamps, and be kept an inch\r\nfrom the ground, by the lower ones, so that air may pass under it. There\r\nshould be a hole in the bottom-board, about four inches in diameter, and\r\ntwo of the same size in the opposite sides of the box, covered with wire\r\ngauze, so that the bees may have an abundance of air, when they are shut\r\nup. Three parallel strips, an inch and a half wide, should be nailed,\r\nabout one third of the way from the top of the temporary hive, at equal\r\ndistances apart, so that the bees may have every opportunity to cluster;\r\na few pieces of old comb, fastened strongly in the top with melted\r\nrosin, will make the bees like it all the better. A handle made of a\r\nstrip of leather, should be nailed on the top. Let the bees be hived in\r\nthis box, and kept well shaded; at evening, or very early next morning,\r\nthe temporary hive which was propped up, when the bees were put into\r\nit, may be shut close to its bottom-board, and a few screws put into the\r\nupper projection of the clamps, so as to run through into the ends of\r\nthe box. In such a box, bees may be safely transported, almost any\r\nreasonable distance: care being taken not to handle them roughly, and\r\nnever to keep them in the sun, or in any place where they have not\r\nsufficient air. If the box is too small, or sufficient ventilators are\r\nnot put in, or if the bees are exposed to too much heat, they will be\r\nsure to suffocate. If the swarm is unusually large, and the weather\r\nexcessively warm, they ought to be moved at night. Unless great care is\r\ntaken in moving bees, in very hot weather, they will be almost sure to\r\nperish; therefore always be _certain_ that they have an abundance of\r\nair. If they appear to be suffering for want of it, especially if they\r\nbegin to fall down from the cluster, and to lie in heaps on the\r\nbottom-board, they should immediately be carried into a field or any\r\nconvenient place, and at once be allowed to fly: in such a case they\r\ncannot be safely moved again, until towards night. This will never be\r\nnecessary if the box is large enough, and suitably ventilated.\r\n\r\nI have frequently made a box for transporting new swarms, out of an old\r\ntea-chest. When a new swarm is brought in this way to its intended home,\r\nthe bottom-board may be unscrewed, and the bees transferred at once, to\r\nthe new hive; (See p. 168.) In some cases, it may be advisable to send\r\naway the new hive. In this case, if one of my hives is used, the spare\r\nhoney-board should be screwed down, and all the holes carefully stopped,\r\nexcept two or three which ought to have some ventilators tacked over\r\nthem: the frames should be fastened with a little paste, so that they\r\nwill not start from their place, and after the bees are hived, the\r\nblocks which close the entrance should be screwed down to their place,\r\nkeeping them however, a trifle less than an eighth of an inch from the\r\nentrance, so as to give the bees all the air which they need. I very\r\nmuch prefer sending a box for the bees: one person can easily carry two\r\nsuch boxes, each with a swarm of bees; and if he chooses to fasten them\r\nto two poles, or to a very large hoop, he may carry four, or even more.\r\n\r\nIf the Apiarian wishes, to be sure the first season, of getting some\r\nhoney from his bees, he will do well to procure two good swarms, and put\r\nthem both into one hive. (See p. 213.) To those who do not object to the\r\nextra expense, I strongly recommend this course. Not unfrequently, they\r\nwill in a good season, obtain in spare honey from their doubled swarm,\r\nan ample equivalent for its increased cost: at all events, such a\r\npowerful swarm lays the foundations of a flourishing stock, which seldom\r\nfails to answer all the reasonable expectations of its owner. If the\r\nApiary is commenced with swarms of the current season, and they have an\r\nabundance of spare room in the upper boxes, there will be no swarming,\r\nthat season, and the beginner will have ample time to make himself\r\nfamiliar with his bees, before being called to hive new swarms, or to\r\nmultiply colonies by artificial means.\r\n\r\nLet no inexperienced person commence bee-keeping on a large scale; very\r\nfew who do so, find it to their advantage, and the most of them not only\r\nmeet with heavy losses, but abandon the pursuit in disgust. By the use\r\nof my hives, the bee-keeper can easily multiply very rapidly, the number\r\nof his colonies, as soon as he finds, not merely that money can be made\r\nby keeping bees, but _that he can make it_. While I am certain that more\r\nmoney can be made by a careful and experienced bee-keeper in a good\r\nsituation, from a given sum invested in an Apiary, than from the same\r\nmoney invested in any other branch of rural economy, I am equally\r\ncertain that there is none in which a careless or inexperienced person\r\nwould be more sure to find his outlay result in an almost entire loss.\r\nAn Apiary neglected or mismanaged, is far worse than a farm overgrown\r\nwith weeds, or exhausted by ignorant tillage: for the land is still\r\nthere, and may, by prudent management, soon be made again to blossom\r\nlike the rose; but the bees, when once destroyed, can never be brought\r\nback to life, unless the poetic fables of the Mantuan Bard, can be\r\naccepted as the legitimate results of actual experience, and swarms of\r\nbees, instead of clouds of filthy flies, can once more be obtained from\r\nthe carcases of decaying animals! I have seen an old medical work in\r\nwhich Virgil's method of obtaining colonies of bees from the putrid body\r\nof a cow slain for this special purpose, is not only credited, but\r\nminutely described.\r\n\r\nA large book would hardly suffice to set forth all the superstitions\r\nconnected with bees. I will refer to one which is very common and which\r\nhas often made a deep impression upon many minds. When any member of a\r\nfamily dies, the bees are believed to be aware of what has happened, and\r\nthe hives are by some dressed in mourning, to pacify their sorrowing\r\noccupants! Some persons imagine that if this is not done, the bees will\r\nnever afterwards prosper, while others assert, that the bees often take\r\ntheir loss so much to heart, as to alight upon the coffin whenever it is\r\nexposed! An intelligent clergyman on reading the sheets of this work,\r\nstated to me that he had always refused to credit this latter fact,\r\nuntil present at a funeral where the bees gathered in such large numbers\r\nupon the coffin, as soon as it was brought out from the house, as to\r\nexcite considerable alarm. Some years after this occurrence, being\r\nengaged in varnishing a table, and finding that the bees came and lit\r\nupon it, he was convinced that the love of varnish, (see p. 85,) instead\r\nof sorrow or respect for the dead, was the occasion of their gathering\r\nround the coffin! How many superstitions in which often intelligent\r\npersons most firmly confide, might if all the facts were known, be as\r\neasily explained.\r\n\r\nBefore closing this Chapter, I must again strongly caution all\r\ninexperienced bee-keepers, against attempting to transfer colonies from\r\nan old hive. I am determined that if any find that they have made a\r\nwanton sacrifice of their bees, they shall not impute their loss to my\r\ndirections. If they persist in making the attempt, let them, by all\r\nmeans, either do it at break of day, before the bees of other hives will\r\nbe induced to commence robbing; or better still, let them do it not only\r\nearly in the morning, but let them carry the hive on which they intend\r\nto operate, to a very considerable distance from the vicinity of the\r\nother hives, and entirely out of sight of the Apiary. I prefer myself\r\nthis last plan, as I then run no risk of attracting other bees to steal\r\nthe honey, and acquire mischievous habits.\r\n\r\nThe bee-keeper is very often reminded by the actions of his bees of some\r\nof the worst traits in poor human nature. When a man begins to sink\r\nunder misfortunes, how many are ready not simply to abandon him, but to\r\npounce upon him like greedy harpies, dragging, if they can, the very bed\r\nfrom under his wife and helpless children, and appropriating all which\r\nby any kind of maneuvering, they can possibly transfer to their already\r\novergrown coffers! With much the same spirit, more pardonable to be sure\r\nin an insect, the bees from other hives, will gather round the one which\r\nis being broken up, and while the disconsolate owners are lamenting over\r\ntheir ruined prospects, will, with all imaginable rapacity and glee,\r\nbear off every drop which they can possibly seize.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[25] Instead of using sticks, I much prefer to make the drumming with\r\nthe open palms of my hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nROBBING.\r\n\r\n\r\nBees are exceedingly prone to rob each other, and unless suitable\r\nprecautions are used to prevent it, the Apiarian will often have cause\r\nto mourn over the ruin of some of his most promising stocks. The moment\r\na departure is made from the old-fashioned mode of managing bees, the\r\nliability to such misfortunes is increased, unless all operations are\r\nperformed by careful and well informed persons.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the precautions which I successfully employ, to guard\r\nmy colonies from robbing each other, or from being robbed by bees from a\r\nstrange Apiary, I shall first explain under what circumstances they are\r\nordinarily disposed to plunder each other. Idleness is with bees, as\r\nwell as with men, a most fruitful mother of mischief. Hence, it is\r\nalmost always when they are doing nothing in the fields, that they are\r\ntempted to increase their stores by dishonest courses. Bees are,\r\nhowever, much more excusable than the lazy rogues of the human family;\r\nfor the _bees_ are idle, not because they are indisposed to work, but\r\nbecause they can find nothing to do. Unless there is some gross\r\nmismanagement, on the part of their owner, they seldom attempt to live\r\nupon stolen sweets, when they have ample opportunity to reap the\r\nabundant harvests of honest industry. In this chapter, I shall be\r\nobliged, however much against my will, to acknowledge that some\r\nbranches of morals in my little friends, need very close watching, and\r\nthat they too often make the lowest sort of distinction, between \"mine\r\nand thine.\" Still I feel bound to show that when thus overcome by\r\ntemptation, it is almost always, under circumstances in which their\r\ncareless owner is by far the most to blame.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring, as soon as the bees are able to fly abroad, \"innatus\r\nurget amor habendi,\" as Virgil has expressed it; that is, they begin to\r\nfeel the force of an innate love of honey-getting. They can find nothing\r\nin the fields, and they begin at once, to see if they cannot appropriate\r\nthe spoils of some weaker hive. They are often impelled to this, by the\r\npressure of immediate want, or the salutary dread of approaching famine:\r\nbut truth obliges me to confess that not unfrequently some of the\r\nstrongest stocks, which have more than they would be able to consume,\r\neven if they gathered nothing more for a whole year, are the most\r\nanxious to prey upon the meager possessions of some feeble colony. Just\r\nlike some rich men who have more money than they can ever use, urged on\r\nby the insatiable love of gain, \"oppress the hireling in his wages, the\r\nwidow and the fatherless,\" and spin on all sides, their crafty webs to\r\nentrap their poorer neighbors, who seldom escape from their toils, until\r\nevery dollar has been extracted from them, and as far as their worldly\r\ngoods are concerned, they resemble the skins and skeletons which line\r\nthe nest of some voracious old spider.\r\n\r\nWhen I have seen some powerful hive of the kind just described,\r\ncondemned by its owner, in the Fall, to the sulphur pit, or deprived\r\nunexpectedly of its queen, its stores plundered, and its combs eaten up\r\nby the worms, I have often thought of the threatenings which God has\r\ndenounced against those who make dishonest gains \"their hope, and say\r\nunto the fine gold, Thou art my confidence.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent colonies from attempting to rob, I always examine\r\nthem in the Spring, to ascertain that they have honey and are in\r\npossession of a fertile queen. If they need food they are supplied with\r\nit, (see Chapter on Feeding,) and if they are feeble or queenless, they\r\nare managed according to the directions previously given. Bees seem to\r\nhave an instinctive perception of the weakness of a colony, and like the\r\nbee-moth, they are almost certain to attack such stocks, especially when\r\nthey have no queen. Hence I can almost always tell that a colony is\r\nqueenless, by seeing robbers constantly attempting to force an entrance\r\ninto it.\r\n\r\nIt requires some knowledge of the habits of bees, to tell from their\r\nmotions, whether they are flying about a strange hive with some evil\r\nintent, or whether they belong to the hive before which they are\r\nhovering. A little experience however, will soon enable us to\r\ndiscriminate between the honest inhabitants of a hive, and the robbers\r\nwhich so often mingle themselves among the crowd. There is an\r\nunmistakable air of roguery about a thieving bee, which to the observing\r\nApiarian, proclaims the nature of his calling, just as truly as the\r\nappearance of a pickpocket in a crowd, enables the experienced police\r\nofficer to distinguish him from the honest folks, on whom he intends to\r\nexercise his skill.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain sneaking look about a rogue of a bee, almost\r\nindescribable, and yet perfectly obvious. It does not alight on the\r\nhive, and boldly enter at once like an honest bee which is carrying home\r\nits load. If they could only assume such an appearance of transparent\r\nhonesty, they would often be allowed by the unsuspecting door-keepers to\r\nenter unquestioned, to see all the sights within, and to help themselves\r\nto the very fat of the land. But there is a sort of nervous haste, and\r\nguilty agitation in all their movements: they never alight boldly upon\r\nthe entrance board, or face the guards which watch the passage to the\r\nhive; they know too well that if caught and overhauled by these trusty\r\nguardians of the hive, their lives would hardly be worth insuring; hence\r\ntheir anxiety to glide in, without touching one of the sentinels. If\r\ndetected, as they have no password to give, (having a strange smell,)\r\nthey are very speedily dealt with, according to their just deserts. If\r\nthey can only effect a secret entrance, those within take it for granted\r\nthat all is right, and seldom subject them to a close examination.\r\n\r\nSometimes bees which have lost their way, are mistaken by the\r\ninexperienced, for robbers; there is however, a most marked distinction\r\nbetween the conduct of the two. The arrant rogue when caught, attempts\r\nwith might and main, to pull away from his executioners, while the poor\r\nbewildered unfortunate shrinks into the smallest compass, like a cowed\r\ndog, and submits to whatever fate his captors may see fit to award him.\r\n\r\nThe class of dishonest bees which I have been describing, may be termed\r\nthe \"Jerry Sneaks\" of their profession, and after they have followed it\r\nfor some time, they lose all disposition for honest pursuits, and assume\r\na hang-dog sort of look, which is very peculiar. Constantly employed in\r\ncreeping into small holes, and daubing themselves with honey, they often\r\nlose all the bright feathers and silky plumes which once so beautifully\r\nadorned their bodies, and assume a smooth and almost black appearance;\r\njust as the hat of the thievish loafer, acquires a \"seedy\" aspect, and\r\nhis garments, a shining and threadbare look. Dzierzon is of opinion that\r\nthe black bees which Huber describes, as being so bitterly persecuted by\r\nthe rest, are nothing more than these thieving bees. I call them old\r\nconvicts, dressed in prison garments, and incurably given up to\r\ndishonest pursuits.\r\n\r\nBees sometimes act the part of highway robbers; some half dozen or more\r\nof them, will waylay and attack a poor humble-bee which is returning\r\nwith a sack full of honey to his nest, like an honest trader, jogging\r\nhome with a well filled purse. They seize the poor bee, and give him at\r\nonce to understand that they must have the earnings of his industry.\r\nThey do not slay him. Oh no! they are much too selfish to endanger their\r\nown precious persons; and even if they could kill him, without losing\r\ntheir weapons, they would still be unable to extract his sweets from the\r\ndeep recesses of his honey bag: they therefore begin to bite and teaze\r\nhim, after the most approved fashion, all the time singing in his ears,\r\n\"not your money,\" but, \"your honey or your life;\" until utterly\r\ndiscouraged, he delivers up his purse, by disgorging his honey from its\r\ncapacious receptacle. The graceless creatures cry \"hands off,\" and\r\nrelease him at once, while they lick up his spoils and carry it off to\r\ntheir home.\r\n\r\nThe remark is frequently made that were rogues to spend half as much\r\ntime and ingenuity in gaining an honest living, as they do, in seeking\r\nto impose upon their fellow-men, their efforts would often be crowned\r\nwith abundant success. Just so of many a dishonest bee. If it only knew\r\nits true interests, it would be safely roving the smiling fields, in\r\nsearch of honey, instead of longing for a tempting and yet dangerous\r\ntaste of forbidden sweets.\r\n\r\nBees sometimes carry on their depredations on a more magnificent scale.\r\nHaving ascertained the weakness of some neighboring colony, through the\r\nsly intrusions of those who have entered the hive to spy out all \"the\r\nnakedness of the land,\" they prepare themselves for war, in the shape\r\nof a pitched battle. The well-armed warriors sally out by thousands, to\r\nattack the feeble hive against which they have so unjustly declared a\r\nremorseless warfare. A furious onset is at once made, and the ground in\r\nfront of the assaulted hive is soon covered with the dead and dying\r\nbodies of innumerable victims. Sometimes the baffled invaders are\r\ncompelled to sound a retreat; too often however, as in human contests,\r\nright proves but a feeble barrier against superior might; the citadel is\r\nstormed, and the work of rapine and pillage forthwith begins. And yet\r\nafter all, matters are not nearly so bad, as at first they seem to be.\r\nThe conquered bees, perceiving that there is no hope for them in\r\nmaintaining the unequal struggle, submit themselves to the pleasure of\r\nthe victors; nay more, they aid them in carrying off their own stores,\r\nand are immediately incorporated into the triumphant nation! The poor\r\nmother however, is left behind in her deserted home, some few of her\r\nchildren which are faithful to the last, remaining with her, to perish\r\nby her side, amid the sad ruins of their once happy home!\r\n\r\nIf the bee-keeper is unwilling to have his bees so demoralized, that\r\ntheir value will be seriously diminished, he will be exceedingly careful\r\nto do all that he possibly can to prevent them from robbing each other.\r\nHe will see that all queenless colonies are seasonably broken up in the\r\nSpring, and all weak ones strengthened, and confined to a space which\r\nthey can warm and defend. If once his bees get a taste of forbidden\r\nsweets, they will seldom stop until they have tested the strength of\r\nevery stock, and destroyed all that they possibly can. Even if the\r\ncolonies are able to defend themselves, many bees will be lost in these\r\nencounters, and a large waste of time will invariably follow; for bees\r\nwhether engaged in attempting to rob, or in battling against the robbery\r\nof others, are, to a very great extent, cut off both from the\r\ndisposition and the ability to engage in useful labors. They are like\r\nnations that are impoverished by mutual assaults on each other: or in\r\nwhich the apprehension of war, exerts a most blighting influence upon\r\nevery branch of peaceful industry.\r\n\r\nI place very great reliance on the movable blocks which guard the\r\nentrance to my hive, to assist colonies in defending themselves against\r\nrobbing bees, as well as the prowling bee-moth. These blocks are\r\ntriangular in shape, and enable the Apiarian to enlarge or contract the\r\nentrance to the hive, at pleasure. In the Spring, the entrance is kept\r\nopen only about two inches, and if the colony is feeble, not more than\r\nhalf an inch. If there is any sign of robbers being about, the small\r\ncolonies have their entrances closed, so that only a single bee can go\r\nin and out at once. As the bottom-board slants forwards, the entrance is\r\non an inclined plane, and the bees which defend it, have a very great\r\nadvantage over those which attack them; the same in short, that the\r\ninhabitants of a besieged fortress would have in defending a pass-way\r\nsimilarly constructed. As only one bee can enter at a time, he is sure\r\nto be overhauled, if he attempts ever so slyly to slip in: his\r\ncredentials are roughly demanded, and as he can produce none, he is at\r\nonce delivered over to the executioners. If an attempt is made to gain\r\nadmission by force, then as soon as a bee gets in, he finds hundreds, if\r\nnot thousands, standing in battle array, and he meets with a reception\r\naltogether too warm for his comfort. I have sometimes stopped robbing,\r\neven after it had proceeded so far that the assaulted bees had ceased to\r\noffer any successful resistance, by putting my blocks before the\r\nentrance, and permitting only a single bee to enter at once: the\r\ndispirited colony have at once recovered heart, and have battled so\r\nstoutly and successfully, as to beat off their assailants.\r\n\r\nWhen bees are engaged in robbing a hive, they will often continue their\r\ndepredations to as late an hour as possible, and not unfrequently some\r\nof them return home so late with their ill-gotten spoils, that they\r\ncannot find the entrance to their own hive. Like the wicked man who\r\n\"deviseth mischief on his bed, and setteth himself in a way that is not\r\ngood,\" they are all night long, meditating new violence, and with the\r\nvery first peep of light, they sally out to complete their unlawful\r\ndoings.\r\n\r\nSometimes the Apiarian may be in doubt whether a colony is being robbed\r\nor not, and may mistake the busy numbers that arrive and depart, for the\r\nhonest laborers of the hive; but let him look into the matter a little\r\nmore closely, and he will soon ascertain the true state of the case: the\r\nbees that enter, instead of being heavily laden, with bodies hanging\r\ndown, unwieldy in their flight, and slow in all their movements, are\r\nalmost as hungry looking as Pharaoh's lean kine, while those that come\r\nout, show by their burly looks, that like aldermen who have dined at the\r\nexpense of the City, they are filled to their utmost capacity.\r\n\r\nIf the Apiarian wishes to guard his bees against the fatal propensity to\r\nplunder each other, he must be exceedingly careful not to have any combs\r\nfilled with honey unnecessarily exposed. An ignorant or careless person\r\nattempting to multiply colonies on my plan, will be almost sure to tempt\r\nhis bees to rob each other. If he leaves any of the combs which he\r\nremoves, so that strange bees find them, they will, after once getting a\r\ntaste of the honey, fly to any hive upon which he begins to operate, and\r\nattempt to appropriate a part of its contents. (See p. 304.) I have\r\nalready stated that when they can find an abundance of food in the\r\nfields, bees are seldom inclined to rob; for this reason, with proper\r\nprecautions, it is not difficult to perform all the operations which are\r\nnecessary on my plan of management, at the proper season, without any\r\ndanger of demoralizing the bees. If however, they are attempted when\r\nhoney cannot be obtained, they should be performed with extreme caution,\r\nand early in the morning, or late in the evening; or if possible, on a\r\nday when the bees are not flying out from their hives. I have sometimes\r\nseen the most powerful colonies in an Apiary, either robbed and\r\ndestroyed, or very greatly reduced in numbers, by the gross carelessness\r\nor ignorance of their owner. He neglects to examine his hives at the\r\nproper season, and the bees begin to rob a weak or queenless stock: as\r\nsoon as they are at the very height of their nefarious operations, he\r\nattempts to interfere with their proceedings, either by shutting up the\r\nhive, or by moving it to a new place. The air is now filled with greedy\r\nand disappointed bees, and rather than fail in obtaining the expected\r\ntreasures, they assail with almost frantic desperation, some of the\r\nneighboring stocks: in this way, the most powerful colonies are\r\nsometimes utterly ruined, or if they escape, thousands of bees are slain\r\nin defending their treasures, and thousands more of the assailants meet\r\nwith the same untimely end.\r\n\r\nIf the Apiarian perceives that one of his colonies is being robbed, he\r\nshould at once contract the entrance, so that only a single bee can get\r\nin at a time; and if the robbers still persist in entering, he must\r\nclose it entirely. In a few minutes the outside of the hive will be\r\nblack with the greedy cormorants, and they will not abandon it, until\r\nthey have explored every crevice, and attempted to force themselves\r\nthrough even the smallest openings. Before they assail a neighboring\r\ncolony, they should be sprinkled with cold water, and then instead of\r\nfeeling courage for new crimes, they will be glad to escape, thoroughly\r\ndrenched, to their proper homes. Unless the bees that are shut up can,\r\nas in my hives, have an abundance of air, it will be necessary to carry\r\nthem at once into a dark and cool place. Early next morning the\r\ncondition of the hive should be examined, and the proper remedies if it\r\nis weak or queenless should be applied; or if its condition is past\r\nremedy, it should at once be broken up, and the bees united to another\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nI have been credibly informed of an exceedingly curious kind of robbing\r\namong bees. Two colonies, both in good condition, seemed determined to\r\nappropriate each other's labors: neither made any resistance to the\r\nentrance of the plundering bees; but each seemed too busily intent upon\r\nits own dishonest gains, to notice[26] that the work of subtraction kept\r\npace with that of addition. An intelligent Apiarian stated to me this\r\nsingular fact as occurring in his own Apiary. This is a very near\r\napproximation to the story of the Kilkenny cats. Alas! that there should\r\nbe so much of equally short-sighted policy among human beings;\r\nindividuals, communities and nations seeking often to thrive by\r\nattempting to prey upon the labors of others, instead of doing all that\r\nthey can, by industry and enterprise, to add to the common stock. I have\r\nnever, in my own experience, met with an instance of such silly\r\npilfering as the one described; but I have occasionally known bees to be\r\ncarrying on their labors, while others were stealing more than the\r\noccupants of the hive were gathering, without their being aware of it.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] The bees in each colony had probably contracted the same smell, and\r\ncould not distinguish friends from foes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR FEEDING BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew things in the practical department of the Apiary, are more important\r\nand yet more shamefully neglected, or grossly mismanaged, than the\r\nfeeding of bees. In order to make this subject as clear as possible, I\r\nshall begin with the Spring examination of the hives, and furnish\r\nsuitable directions for feeding during the whole season in which it\r\nought to be attempted. In the movable comb hives, the exact condition of\r\nthe bees with regard to stores, may be easily ascertained as soon as the\r\nweather is warm enough to lift out the frames. In the common hives, this\r\ncan sometimes be ascertained from the glass sides; but often no reliable\r\ninformation can be obtained. Even if the weight of the hive is known,\r\nthis will be no sure criterion of the quantity of honey it contains. The\r\ncomb in old hives, is often very thick, and of course, unusually heavy;\r\nwhile vast stores of useless bee-bread have frequently been accumulated,\r\nwhich entirely deceive the Apiarian, who attempts to judge of the\r\nresources of a hive from its weight alone. On my system of bee-culture,\r\nsuch an injurious surplus of bee-bread, is easily prevented; (See p.\r\n102.)\r\n\r\nIf the bee-keeper ascertains or even suspects, in the Spring, that his\r\nbees have not sufficient food, he must at once supply them with what\r\nthey need. Bees, at this season of the year, consume a very large\r\nquantity of honey: they are stimulated to great activity by the\r\nreturning warmth, and are therefore compelled to eat much more than when\r\nthey were almost dormant among their combs. In addition to this extra\r\ndemand, they are now engaged in rearing thousands of young, and all\r\nthese require a liberal supply of food. Owing to the inexcusable neglect\r\nof many bee-keepers, thousands of swarms perish annually after the\r\nSpring has opened, and when they might have been saved, with but little\r\ntrouble or expense. Such abominable neglect is incomparably more cruel\r\nthan the old method of taking up the bees with sulphur; and those who\r\nare guilty of it, are either too ignorant or too careless, to have any\r\nthing to do with the management of bees. What would be thought of a\r\nfarmer's skill in his business, who should neglect to provide for the\r\nwants of his cattle, and allow them to drop down lifeless in their\r\nstalls, or in his barn-yard, when the fields, in a few weeks, will be\r\nclothed again with the green mantle of delightful Spring! If any farmer\r\nshould do this, when food might easily be purchased, and should then,\r\nwhile engaged in the work of skinning the skeleton carcasses of his\r\nneglected herd, pretend that he could not afford to furnish, for a few\r\nweeks, the food which would have kept them alive, he would not be a whit\r\nmore stupid than the bee-keeper attempting to justify himself on the\r\nscore of economy, while engaged in melting down the combs of a hive,\r\nstarved to death, after the Spring has fairly opened! Let such a person\r\nblush at the pretence that he could not afford to feed his bees, the few\r\npounds of sugar or honey, which would have saved their lives, and\r\nenabled them to repay him tenfold for his prudent care.\r\n\r\nI always feed my bees a little, even if I know that they have enough and\r\nto spare. There seems to be an intimate connection between the getting\r\nof honey, and the rapid increase of breeding, in a hive; and the taste\r\nof something sweet, however small, to be added to their hoards, exerts a\r\nvery stimulating effect upon the bees; a few spoonsfull a day, will be\r\ngratefully received, and will be worth much more to a stock of bees in\r\nthe Spring, than at any other time.\r\n\r\nBy judicious early feeding, a whole Apiary may be not only encouraged to\r\nbreed much faster than they otherwise would have done; but they will be\r\ninspired with unusual vigor and enterprise, and will afterwards increase\r\ntheir stores with unusual rapidity. Great caution must be exercised in\r\nsupplying bees at this time with food, both to prevent them from being\r\ntempted to rob each other, or to fill up with honey, the cells which\r\nought to be supplied with brood. Only a small allowance should be given\r\nto them, and this from time to time, unless they are destitute of\r\nsupplies; and as soon as they begin to gather from the fields, the\r\nfeeding should be discontinued. Feeding, intended merely to encourage\r\nthe bees, and to promote early breeding, may be done in the open air. No\r\ngreater mistake can be made than to feed largely at this season of the\r\nyear. The bees take, to be sure, all that they can, and stow it up in\r\ntheir cells, but what is the consequence? The honey which has been fed\r\nto them, fills up their brood combs, and the increase of population is\r\nmost seriously interfered with; so that often when stocks which have not\r\nbeen over-fed, are prepared not only to fill all the store combs in\r\ntheir main hive, but to take speedy possession of the spare honey boxes,\r\na colony imprudently fed, is too small in numbers, to gather even as\r\nmuch as the one which was not fed at all! The inexperienced Apiarian has\r\nthus often made a worse use of his honey than he would have done, if he\r\nhad actually thrown it away! while all the time, he is deluding himself\r\nwith the vain expectation of reaping some wonderful profits, from what\r\nhe considers an improved mode of managing bees.\r\n\r\nSuch conduct in its results, appears to me very much like the noxious\r\ninfluences under which too many of the children of the rich are so\r\nfatally reared. With every want gratified, pampered and fed to the very\r\nfull, how often do we see them disappoint all the fond expectations of\r\nparents and friends, their money proving only a curse, while not\r\nunfrequently beggared in purse, and bankrupt in character, they\r\nprematurely sink to an ignoble or dishonored grave. Think of it, ye who\r\nare slaving in the service of Mammon, that ye may leave to your sons,\r\nthe overgrown wealth which usually proves a legacy of withering curses,\r\nwhile you neglect to train them up in those habits of stern morality and\r\nsteady industry, and noble self-reliance, without which the wealth of\r\nCroesus would be but a despicable portion! Think of it, as you\r\ncontrast its results in the bitter experience of thousands, with the\r\nhappier influences under which so many of our noblest men in Church and\r\nState, have been nurtured and developed, and then pursue your sordid\r\npolicy, if you can. \"There is that withholdeth\" from good objects, \"more\r\nthan is meet, and it tendeth to poverty:\" yes, to poverty of Christian\r\nvirtue and manliness, and of those \"treasures\" which we are all\r\nentreated by God himself, to \"lay up\" in the store-house of Heaven. Call\r\nyour narrow-mindedness and gross deficiencies in Christian liberality,\r\nnothing more than a natural love of your children, and an earnest desire\r\nto provide for your own household. Little fear there may be that _you_\r\nwill ever incur the charge of being \"worse than an infidel\" on this\r\npoint; but lay not on this account, any flattering unction to your\r\nsouls; look within, and see if the base idolatry of gold has not more to\r\ndo with your whole course of thinking and acting, than any love of wife\r\nor children, relatives or friends!\r\n\r\nAnother _sermon_! does some one exclaim? Would then that it might be to\r\nsome of my readers a sermon indeed; \"a word fitly spoken,\" \"like apples\r\nof gold in pictures of silver.\"\r\n\r\nThe prudent Apiarian will always regard the feeding of bees, except the\r\nlittle, given to them by way of encouragement, as an evil to be\r\nsubmitted to, only when absolutely necessary; and will very much prefer\r\nto obtain his supplies from what Shakspeare has so beautifully termed\r\nthe \"merry pillage\" of the blooming fields, than from the more costly\r\nstores of the neighboring grocery. If not engaged in the rapid increase\r\nof stocks, he will seldom see a season so unfavorable as to be obliged\r\nto purchase any food for his bees, unless he chooses to buy a cheaper\r\narticle, to replace the choice honey of which he has deprived them. Just\r\nas soon as the Apiarian begins to multiply his stocks with very great\r\nrapidity, he must calculate upon feeding great quantities of honey to\r\nhis bees. Before he attempts this on a large scale, let me once more\r\ngive him a friendly caution, and if possible, persuade him to try very\r\nrapid multiplication with only a few of his stocks. In this way, he may\r\nexperiment to his heart's content, without running the risk of seriously\r\ninjuring his whole Apiary, and he may not only gain the skill and\r\nexperience which will enable him subsequently to conduct a rapid\r\nincrease, on a large scale, but may learn whether he is so situated that\r\nhe can profitably devote to it the time and money which it will\r\ninevitably require.\r\n\r\nBefore giving directions for feeding bees when a rapid increase of\r\ncolonies is aimed at, I shall first show in what manner the bee-keeper\r\nmay feed his weak swarms in the Spring. If they are in the common hives,\r\na small quantity of liquid honey may, at once be poured among the combs\r\nin which the bees are clustered: this may be done by pouring it into the\r\nholes leading to the spare honey boxes, but a much better way is to\r\ninvert the hives, and pour in about a tea-cup full at once. The Apiarian\r\ncan then see just where to pour it; he need not fear that the bees will\r\nbe hurt by it; any more than a child will be either hurt or displeased\r\nby the sweets which adhere to its hands and face, as it feasts upon a\r\ngenerous allowance of the best sugar candy! When the bees have taken up\r\nall that has been poured upon them, the hive may be replaced, and the\r\noperation repeated in a few days: the oftener it is done, the better it\r\nwill suit them. If the weather is sufficiently warm to allow the bees to\r\nfly without being chilled, the food may be put in some old combs, or in\r\na feeder, and set in a sunny place, a rod or more from their hives. If\r\nplaced too near, the bees may be tempted to rob each other. With my\r\nhives, I can pour the honey into some empty comb, and then put the frame\r\ncontaining it, directly into the hive; or I can set the feeder or honey\r\nin the comb, in the hive near the frames which contain the bees. I have\r\nalready stated, (see p. 225,) that unless a colony can be supplied with\r\na sufficient number of bees, it cannot be aided by giving it food. If\r\nthe bees are not numerous enough to take charge of the eggs which the\r\nqueen can lay, or at least, of a large number of them, they can seldom,\r\nunless they have a tropical season before them, increase rapidly enough\r\nto be of any value. If they are numerous enough to raise a great many\r\nyoung bees, but too few to build new comb, they must be fed very\r\nmoderately, or they will be sure to fill up their brood comb with honey,\r\ninstead of devoting themselves to the rapid increase of their numbers.\r\nIf the Apiarian has plenty of empty worker comb which he can give them,\r\nhe ought to supply them quite sparingly with honey, even when they are\r\nconsiderably numerous, in order to have them breed as fast as possible;\r\nnot so sparingly however, as to prevent them from storing up any honey\r\nin sealed cells; or they will not be encouraged to breed as fast as they\r\notherwise would. If he has no spare comb, and the hive is populous\r\nenough to build new comb, it must be supplied moderately, and by all\r\nmeans, _regularly_ with the means of doing this; the object being to\r\nhave comb building and breeding go together, so as mutually to aid each\r\nother. If the feeding is not regular, so as to resemble the natural\r\nsupplies when honey is obtained from the blossoms, the bees will not use\r\nthe food given to them, in building new comb, but chiefly in filling up\r\nall the cells previously built. If honey can be obtained regularly, and\r\nin sufficient quantities from the blossoms, the small colonies or nuclei\r\nwill need no feeding until the failure of the natural supplies.\r\n\r\nIn all these operations, the main object should be to make every thing\r\nbend to the most rapid production of _brood_; give me the bees, and I\r\ncan easily show how they may be fed, so as to make strong and prosperous\r\nstocks; whereas if the bees are wanting, every thing else will be in\r\nvain: just as a land where there are many stout hands and courageous\r\nhearts, although comparatively barren, will in due time, be made to \"bud\r\nand blossom as the rose,\" while a second Eden, if inhabited by a scanty\r\nand discouraged population, must speedily be overgrown with briars and\r\nthorns.\r\n\r\nIf strong stocks are deprived of a portion of their combs, so that they\r\ncannot from natural sources, at once begin to refill all vacancies, they\r\ntoo must be fed.\r\n\r\nI have probably said enough to show the inexperienced that the rapid\r\nmultiplication of colonies is not a very simple matter, and that they\r\nwill do well not to attempt it on a large scale. By the time the honey\r\nharvest ordinarily closes, all the colonies in the Apiaries of all\r\nexcept the skillful, ought to be both strong in numbers and in stores;\r\nat least the _aggregate_ resources of the colonies should be such that\r\nwhen an equal division is made among them, there will be enough for them\r\nall. This may ordinarily be effected, and yet the number of the colonies\r\nbe tripled in one season; and in situations where buckwheat is\r\nextensively cultivated, a considerable quantity of surplus honey may\r\neven then be frequently obtained from the bees. Early in the month of\r\nSeptember, or better still, by the middle of August, if the colonies are\r\nsufficiently strong in numbers, I advise that if feeding is necessary to\r\nwinter the bees, it should be thoroughly attended to. If delayed later\r\nthan this, in the latitude of our Northern States, the bees may not have\r\nsufficient time to seal over the honey fed to them, and will be almost\r\nsure to suffer from dysentery, during the ensuing Winter. Unsealed\r\nhoney, almost always, in cool weather, attracts moisture, and sours in\r\nthe combs, and if the bees are compelled to feed upon it, they are very\r\nliable to become diseased. This is the reason why bees when fed with\r\nliquid honey, late in the Fall, or during the Winter, are almost sure to\r\nsuffer from disease. A very interesting fact confirming these views as\r\nto the danger resulting from the use of sour food, has come under my\r\nnotice this Spring. A colony of bees were fed for some time with\r\nsuitable food, and appeared to be in perfect health, flying in and out\r\nwith great animation. Their owner, on one occasion, before leaving for\r\nthe day, gave them some molasses which was so _sour_, that it could not\r\nbe used in the family. On returning, at evening, he was informed that\r\nthe bees had been dropping their filth over every thing in the vicinity\r\nof the hive. On examining them, next day, they were all found dead on\r\nthe bottom-board and among the combs! The acid food had acted upon them\r\nas a violent cathartic, and had brought on a complaint of which they\r\nall died in less than 24 hours: the hive was found to contain an ample\r\nallowance of honey and bee-bread.\r\n\r\nIf the Apiarian, on examining the condition of his stocks, finds that\r\nsome have more than they need, and others not enough, his most prudent\r\ncourse will be to make an equitable division of the honey, among his\r\ndifferent stocks. This may seem to be a very Agrarian sort of procedure,\r\nand yet it will answer perfectly well in the management of bees. Those\r\nthat were helped, will not spend the next season in idleness, relying\r\nupon the same sort of aid; nor will those that were relieved of their\r\nsurplus stores, remember the deprivation, and limit the extent of their\r\ngatherings to a bare competency. With men, most unquestionably, such an\r\nannual division, unless they were perfect, would derange the whole\r\ncourse of affairs, and speedily impoverish any community in which it\r\nmight be attempted. I always prefer to take away a considerable quantity\r\nof honey from my stocks, which have too generous a supply, and to\r\nreplace it with empty combs suitable for the rearing of workers; as I\r\nfind that when bees have too much honey in the Fall, they do not\r\nordinarily breed as fast in the ensuing Spring, as they otherwise would.\r\nA portion of this honey should be carefully put away in the frames, and\r\nkept in a close box, safe against all intruders, and where it will not\r\nbe exposed to frost; so that if any colonies in the Spring, are found to\r\nbe in want of food, they may easily be supplied.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring examination, if any colonies have too much honey, a\r\nportion of it ought by all means to be taken away. Such a deprivation,\r\nif judiciously performed, will always stimulate them to increased\r\nactivity. Every strong stock, as soon as it can gather enough honey to\r\nconstruct comb, ought to have one or two combs which contain no brood\r\nremoved, and their places supplied with empty frames, in order that they\r\nmay be induced to exert themselves to the utmost. An empty frame\r\ninserted between full ones, will be replenished with comb very speedily,\r\nand often the combs removed will be so much clear gain. If at any time\r\nthere is a sudden supply of honey, and the bees are reluctant to enter\r\nthe boxes, or it is not probable that the supply will continue long\r\nenough to enable them to fill them, the removal of some of the combs\r\nfrom the main hive so as to have empty ones filled, will often be highly\r\nadvantageous.\r\n\r\nIf in the Fall of the year, the bee-keeper finds that some of his\r\ncolonies need feeding, and if they are not populous enough to make good\r\nstock hives in the ensuing Spring, then instead of wasting time and\r\nmoney on them, he should at once, break them up; (See p. 322.) They will\r\nseldom pay for the labor bestowed on them, and the bees will be much\r\nmore serviceable, if added to other stocks. The Apiarian cannot be too\r\ndeeply impressed with the important truth, that his profits in\r\nbee-keeping will all come from his _strong_ stocks, and that if he\r\ncannot manage so as to have such colonies early, he had better let\r\nbee-keeping alone.\r\n\r\nIf liquid honey is fed to bees, it should always, (see p. 322,) be given\r\nto them seasonably, so that they may seal it over before the approach of\r\ncold weather. West India honey has for many years, been used to very\r\ngood advantage, as a bee-feed. It should never be used in its raw state,\r\nas it is often filled with impurities, and is very liable to sour or\r\ncandy in the cells, but should be mixed with about two parts of good\r\nwhite sugar, to three of honey and one of water, and brought to the\r\nboiling point; as soon as it begins to boil, it should be set to cool,\r\nand all the impurities will rise to the top, and may be skimmed off. If\r\nit is found to be too thick, a little more water may be added to it; it\r\nought however, never to be made thinner than the natural consistence of\r\ngood honey. Such a mixture will cost for a small quantity, about seven\r\ncents a pound, and will probably be found the cheapest liquid food,\r\nwhich can be given to bees. Brown sugar may be used with the honey, but\r\nthe food will not be so good.\r\n\r\nIf one of my hives is used, the bee-keeper may feed his bees at the\r\nproper season, without using any feeder at all, or rather he may use the\r\n_bottom-board_ of the hive as a feeder. On this plan, the bees should be\r\nfed at evening; so as to run no risk of their robbing each other. The\r\nhive which is to be fed, should have the front edge of its bottom-board\r\nelevated on a block, so as to slant _backwards_, and the honey should be\r\npoured into a small tin gutter inserted at the entrance; one such will\r\nanswer for a whole Apiary, and may be made by bending up the edges of\r\nany old piece of tin. As the frames in my hive are kept about half an\r\ninch above the bottom-board, which is water-tight, the honey runs under\r\nthem, and is as safe as in a dish, while the bees stand on the bottom of\r\nthe frames, and help themselves. The quantity poured in, should of\r\ncourse, depend upon the size and necessities of the colony; no more\r\nought to be given at one time than the bees can take up during the\r\nnight, and the entrance to the hive ought always to be kept very small\r\nduring the process of feeding, to prevent robber bees from getting in; a\r\ngood colony will easily take up a quart. It is desirable to get through\r\nthe feeding as rapidly as possible, as the bees are excited during the\r\nwhole process, and consume more than they otherwise would; to say\r\nnothing of the demand made upon the time of the Apiarian, by feeding in\r\nsmall quantities. If the bees cannot, in favorable weather, dispose of\r\nat least a pint at one time, the colony must be too small to make it\r\nworth while to feed them, if they are in hives by which they can be\r\nreadily united to stronger stocks.\r\n\r\nIf the bees have not a good allowance of comb, it will not, as a general\r\nrule, pay to feed them. This will be obvious to any one who reflects\r\nthat at least 20 pounds of honey are required to elaborate one pound of\r\nwax. I know that this estimate may to some, appear enormous; but it is\r\ngiven as the result of very accurate experiments, instituted on a large\r\nscale, to determine this very point. The Country Curate says, \"Having\r\ndriven the population of four stocks, on the 5th of August, and united\r\nthem together, I fed them with about 50 pounds of a mixture of sugar,\r\nhoney, salt and beer, for about five weeks. At that time, the box was\r\nonly 16 pounds heavier than when the bees were put into it.\" He then\r\nmakes an estimate that at least 25 pounds of the mixture were consumed\r\nin making about half a pound of wax!! No one who has ever tried it, will\r\nundertake to feed bees for profit, when they are destitute of both comb\r\nand honey.\r\n\r\nIf the weather is cool when bees are fed, it will generally be necessary\r\nto resort to top feeding. For this, my hive is admirably adapted: a\r\nfeeder may be put over one of the holes in the honey-board directly over\r\nthe mass of the bees, into which the heat of the hive naturally arises,\r\nand where the bees can get at their food without any risk of being\r\nchilled. This is _always_ the best place for a feeder, as the smell of\r\nthe food is not so likely to attract the notice of robbing bees.\r\n\r\nI shall here describe the way in which a feeder can at small expense, be\r\nmade to answer admirably every purpose. Take any wooden box which will\r\nhold, say, at least one quart; make it honey-tight, by pouring into the\r\njoints the melted mixture, (see p. 99,) and brush the whole interior\r\nwith the mixture, so that the honey may not soak into the wood. Make a\r\nfloat of thin wood, filled with quarter inch holes, with clamps nailed\r\non the lower sides to prevent warping, and to keep the float from\r\nsettling to the bottom of the box, so as to stick fast: it should have\r\nample play, so that it may settle, as fast as the bees consume the\r\nhoney. Tacks on the clamps will always be sure to prevent sticking.\r\nBefore you waste any time in making small holes, for fear the bees will\r\nbe drowned in the large ones, try a float made as directed. In one\r\ncorner of the box, fasten with the melted mixture, a thin strip of wood,\r\nabout one inch wide; let it project above the top of the box about an\r\ninch, and be kept about half an inch from the bottom; this answers as a\r\nspout for pouring the honey into the feeder, and when not in use, it\r\nshould be stopped up. Have for the lid of the box, a piece of glass with\r\nthe corner cut off next the spout, so as to cover the feeder and keep\r\nthe bees in, and at the same time allow the bee-keeper to see when they\r\nhave consumed all their food. The feeder is now complete, with one\r\nimportant exception; it has, as yet no way of admitting the bees. On the\r\noutside corners of one of the ends, glue or tack two strips, inch and a\r\nhalf wide, extending down to the bottom of the box, and half an inch\r\nfrom the top; fasten over them a piece of thin board, (paste-board will\r\nanswer.) You have now a shallow passage without top or bottom, outside\r\nof your feeder; give it a top of any kind; cut out just below the level\r\nof this top, a passage into the feeder for the bees. It is now complete,\r\nand when properly placed over any hole on the top of the hive, will\r\nadmit the bees from the hive, into the shallow passage which has no\r\nbottom, and through this into the feeder. Such a feeder will not only be\r\ncheap, but it might almost be made by a child, and yet it will answer\r\nevery purpose most admirably. If you have no wooden box that will\r\nanswer, a feeder may be made of pasteboard, and if brushed with the\r\nmelted mixture it will be honey-tight. By packing cotton or wool around\r\nit, it might be used in most hives, even in the dead of Winter. Bees\r\nhowever, ought never to need feeding in Winter, and if they do, it will\r\nalways be unsafe at this season to feed them with liquid honey.\r\n\r\nI ought here to speak of the importance of _water_ to the bees. It is\r\nabsolutely indispensable when they are building comb, or raising brood.\r\nIn the early Spring, they take advantage of the first warm weather, to\r\nbring it to their hives, and they may be seen busily drinking around\r\npumps, drains, and other moist places. As they are not noticed\r\nfrequenting such spots much, except in the early part of the season,\r\nmany suppose that they need water only at this period. This is a great\r\nmistake, for they need it, and must have it, during the whole breeding\r\nseason. But as soon as the grass starts, and the trees are covered with\r\nleaves, they prefer to sip the dew from them. If a few cold days come\r\non, after the bees have commenced breeding, so as to prevent them from\r\ngoing abroad for water, a very serious check will be given to their\r\noperations. Even when it is not so cold as to prevent their leaving the\r\nhive, many become so chilled in their search for water, that they are\r\nnot able to return.\r\n\r\nEvery wise bee-keeper will see that his bees have an abundant supply of\r\nwater. If he has not some warm and sunny spot where they can safely\r\nobtain it, he will furnish them with shallow wooden troughs or vessels\r\nfilled with pebbles, from which they can drink, without any risk of\r\ndrowning, and where they will be sheltered from cold winds, and warmed\r\nby the genial rays of the sun. I believe that the reason why bees very\r\nmuch prefer the impure water of barn-yards and drains, is not because\r\nthey find any medicinal quality in it, but because as it is _near_ their\r\nhives and _warm_, they can fill themselves without being fatally\r\nchilled.\r\n\r\nI have used water feeders of the same construction with my honey\r\nfeeders, with great success. The bees are able to enter them at all\r\ntimes, as they are filled with the warm air of the hive, and thus\r\nbreeding goes on, without interruption, and the lives of many bees are\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nThe same end may be obtained, by pouring daily, a few table spoonsfull\r\nof water into the hive, through one of the holes leading to the spare\r\nhoney boxes. As soon as the weather becomes warm, and the bees can\r\nsupply themselves from the dew on the grass and leaves, it will not be\r\nworth while to give them water in their hives.\r\n\r\nWhen supplied with water in their hives, I advise that enough honey or\r\nsugar be added to it, to make it tolerably sweet. They will take it with\r\ngreater relish, and it will stimulate them more powerfully to the\r\nraising of brood.\r\n\r\nI come now to mention a substitute for liquid honey, the value of which\r\nhas been extensively and thoroughly tested in Germany, and which I have\r\nused with great advantage. It was not discovered by Dzierzon, although\r\nhe speaks of its excellence, in the most decided terms. The article to\r\nwhich I refer, is _plain sugar candy_, or as it is often called, barley\r\ncandy. It has been ascertained that about four pounds of this, will\r\nsustain a colony during the Winter, when they have scarcely any honey in\r\ntheir hive! If it is placed where they can get access to it without\r\nbeing chilled, they will cluster upon it, and gradually eat it up. It\r\nnot only goes further than double the quantity of liquid honey which\r\ncould be bought for the same money, but is found to agree with the bees\r\nperfectly; while the liquid honey is almost sure to sour in the unsealed\r\ncells, and expose them to dangerous, and often fatal attacks of\r\ndysentery. I have sometimes, in the old-fashioned box hives, pushed\r\nsticks of candy between the ranges of comb, and have found it even then\r\nto answer a good purpose. In any hive which has surplus honey boxes, the\r\ncandy may be put into a small box, which after being covered thoroughly\r\nwith cotton or wool, may have another box put over it, the outside of\r\nwhich may be also covered. Unless great precautions are used, the boxes\r\nwill be so cold, that the bees will not be able to enter them in Winter,\r\nand may thus perish in close proximity to abundant stores.\r\n\r\nIn my hives, the candy may be laid on the top of the frames, in the\r\nshallow chamber between the frames and the honey-board; it will here, if\r\nthe honey-board is covered with straw, be always accessible to the bees,\r\neven in the coldest weather. I sometimes put it directly into a frame,\r\nand confine it with a piece of twine, or fine wire.\r\n\r\nI have made a very convenient use of sugar candy, as a bee-feed in the\r\nSummer, when I wished to give small colonies a little food, and yet not\r\nto be at the trouble to use a feeder, or incur the risk of their being\r\nrobbed by putting it where strange bees might be attracted by the scent.\r\nA small stick of candy, slid in on the bottom-board, under the frames,\r\nanswers admirably for such a purpose. If a little liquid food must be\r\nused in warm weather, I advise that it be the best white sugar,\r\ndissolved in water; this makes an admirable food; costs but little more\r\nthan brown sugar, and has no smell to tempt robbers to try to gain an\r\nentrance into the hive.\r\n\r\nIf the Apiarian is skillful, and attends to his bees, at the proper\r\ntime, they will rarely need much feeding; if he manages them in such a\r\nmanner that this is frequently and extensively needed, I can assure him,\r\nif he has not already found it out to his sorrow, that his bees will be\r\nnothing but a bill of cost and vexation.\r\n\r\nThe question how much honey a colony of bees needs, in order to carry\r\nthem safely through the perils of Winter, is one to which it is\r\nimpossible to give an answer which will be definite, under all\r\ncircumstances. Very much will depend upon the hive in which they are\r\nkept, and the forwardness of the ensuing Spring; (see Chapter on\r\nProtection.) It is often absolutely impossible in the common hives, to\r\nform any reliable estimate, as to the quantity of honey which they\r\ncontain, for the combs are often so heavy with bee-bread, as entirely to\r\ndeceive even the most experienced bee-keeper.\r\n\r\nI should always wish to leave at least 20 lbs. of honey in a hive; and\r\nas I can examine each comb, I am never at a loss to know how much a\r\ncolony has. If I have the least apprehension that their supplies may\r\nfail, I prefer to put a few pounds of sugar candy where they can easily\r\nget access to it, in case of need. In my hive, the careful bee-keeper\r\nmay not only know the exact extent of the resources of each hive, in the\r\nFall, but he may, very early in the Spring, ascertain precisely how much\r\nhoney is still on hand, and whether his bees need feeding, in order to\r\npreserve their lives. It is a shameful fact that a large number of\r\ncolonies perish after they have begun to fly out, and when, they might\r\neasily have been saved, in any kind of hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING, TO MAKE A PROFIT BY SELLING THE HONEY STORED UP BY THE BEES.\r\n\r\nFor many years, Apiarians have attempted to make the feeding of bees on\r\na large scale, profitable to their owners. All such attempts however,\r\nmust, from the very nature of the case, meet with very limited success.\r\nIf large quantities of cheap West India honey are fed to the bees in the\r\nFall, they are induced to fill their hives to such an extent, that in\r\nthe Spring, the queen does not find the necessary accommodations for\r\nbreeding. If they are largely fed in the Spring, the case is still\r\nworse; (See p. 320.) It must therefore be obvious that the feeding of\r\ncheap honey can only be made profitable where it serves as a substitute\r\nfor an equal quantity of choice honey taken from the bees. In the latter\r\npart of Summer, the Apiarian may take away from the main hive, some of\r\nthe combs which contain the best honey, and replace them with combs into\r\nwhich he has poured the cheaper article; or if he has no spare combs on\r\nhand, he may slice off the covers of the cells, drain out the honey,\r\nfill the empty combs with West India honey, and return them to the bees:\r\ngiving them at the same time, the additional food which they need to\r\nelaborate wax to seal them over. If he attempts to take away their full\r\ncombs, and gives them honey in order to enable them, first to replace\r\ntheir combs, and then to fill them, the operation, (see p. 326,) will\r\nresult in a loss, instead of a gain.\r\n\r\nI am aware that for a number of years, persons have attempted to derive\r\na profit from supplying the markets of some of our large cities, with an\r\narticle professing to be the best of honey, but which has been nothing\r\nmore than the cheap West India honey fed to the bees, and stored up by\r\nthem in new comb. In the City of Philadelphia, large quantities of such\r\nhoney have been sold at the highest prices, and _perhaps_ at some profit\r\nto the persons who have fed it to their bees. Within the last two years,\r\nhowever, the article has become so well known that it can hardly be sold\r\nat any price; as those who purchase honey, instead of paying 25 cents\r\nper pound for West India honey in the comb, much prefer to buy it, (if\r\nthey want it at all,) for 6 or 7 cents, in a liquid state! It must be\r\nperfectly obvious that to sell a cheap and ill-flavored article at a\r\nhigh price, under the pretence that it is a superior article, is nothing\r\nless than downright cheating.\r\n\r\nI am perfectly well aware that many persons imagine that if any thing\r\n_sweet_ is fed to bees, they will quickly transmute it into the purest\r\nnectar. There is, however, no more truth in such a conceit, than there\r\nwould be in that of a man who supposed that he had found the veritable\r\nphilosopher's stone; and that he was able to change all our copper and\r\nsilver coins into the purest gold! Bees to be sure, can make white and\r\nbeautiful _comb_, from almost any kind of sweet; and why? because wax is\r\na natural secretion of the bee, (see p. 76,) and can be made from any\r\nsweet; just as fat can be put upon the ribs of an ox, by any kind of\r\nnourishing food.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" some of my readers may ask, \"do you mean to assert that bees do\r\nnot secrete honey out of the raw material which they gather, or which is\r\nfurnished to them, just as cows secrete milk from grass and hay?\" I\r\ncertainly do mean to assert that they can do nothing of the kind, and no\r\nintelligent man who has carefully _studied their habits_, will for a\r\nmoment, venture to affirm that they can, unless for the sake of \"filthy\r\nlucre,\" he is attempting to deceive an unwary community. What bee-keeper\r\ndoes not know, or rather ought not to know that the quality of honey\r\ndepends entirely upon the sources from whence it is gathered; and that\r\nthe different kinds of honey can easily be distinguished by any one who\r\nis a judge of the article.\r\n\r\nApple-blossom honey, white clover honey, buckwheat honey, and all the\r\ndifferent kinds of honey, each has its own peculiar flavor, and it is\r\nutterly amazing how any sensible man, acquainted with bees, can be so\r\ndeluded as to imagine any thing to the contrary. But as this is a matter\r\nof great practical importance, let us examine it more closely.\r\n\r\nWhen bees are engaged in rapidly storing up honey in their combs, they\r\nmay be seen, as _soon_ as they return from the fields, or from the\r\nfeeding boxes, putting their heads at once into the cells, and\r\ndisgorging the contents of their \"honey-bags.\" Now that the contents of\r\ntheir sacs undergo no change at all, during the short time that they\r\nremain in them, I will not absolutely affirm, because I have endeavored,\r\nthrough this whole treatise, never to assert positively when I had not\r\npositive evidence for so doing: but that they can undergo but a _very\r\nslight_ change, must be evident from the fact that when thus stored up,\r\nthe different kinds of honey or sugar can be almost if not quite as\r\nreadily distinguished as before they were fed to the bees. The only\r\nperceptible change which they appear to undergo in the cells, is to have\r\nthe large quantity of water evaporated from them, which is added from\r\nthoughtlessness, or from the vain expectation that it will be just so\r\nmuch water sold for honey, to the defrauded purchaser! This evaporation\r\nof the water from the honey by the heat of the hive, is about the only\r\nmarked change that it appears to undergo, from its natural state in the\r\nnectaries of the blossoms; and it is exceedingly interesting to see how\r\nunwilling bees are to seal up honey, until it is reduced to such a\r\nconsistency that there is no danger of its souring in the cells. They\r\nare as careful as to the quality of their nectar, as the good lady of\r\nthe house is, to have the syrup of her preserves boiled down to a\r\nsuitable thickness to keep them sweet.\r\n\r\nLet all who for any purpose whatever, feed bees, keep this fact in mind,\r\nand never add to the food which they give them, more water than is\r\nabsolutely necessary. To do so, is a piece of as great stupidity as to\r\npour a barrel of water into the sugar pans, for every barrel of sap from\r\nthe maples, or juice from the canes! If a strong colony is set upon a\r\nplatform scale, it will be found on a pleasant day, during the height of\r\nthe honey harvest, to gain a number of pounds; if examined again, early\r\nnext morning, it will be found to have lost considerably, during the\r\nnight. This is owing to the evaporation of the water from the freshly\r\ngathered honey, and it may often be seen running down in quite a stream\r\nfrom the bottom-board.\r\n\r\nThose who feed cheap honey to sell it in the market at a high advance\r\nover its first cost, are either deceivers or deceived; if any of my\r\nreaders have been deceived by the plausible representations of ignorant\r\nor unprincipled men, I trust they will be able from these remarks, to\r\nsee exactly _how_ they have been deceived, and they will no longer\r\npersist in an adulteration, the profits of which can never be great, and\r\nthe morality of which can never be defended. A man who offers for sale,\r\ninferior honey, or sugar which he calls honey, and which he is able to\r\nsell because it is stored in white comb, to those who would never\r\npurchase it if they knew what it was, or once had a taste of it, is not\r\na whit more honest, if he understands the nature of the article in which\r\nhe deals, than a person engaged in counterfeiting the current coin of\r\nthe realm: for poor honey in white comb, is no less a fraud than eagles\r\nor dollars, golden to be sure, on their honest exteriors, but containing\r\na baser metal within! \"The Golden Age\" of bee-keeping, in which inferior\r\nhoney can be quickly transmuted into such balmy spoils as are gathered\r\nby the bees of Hybla, has not yet dawned upon us; or at least only in\r\nthe fairy visions of the poet who saw\r\n\r\n    \"A golden hive, on a Golden Bank,\r\n    Where golden bees, by alchemical prank,\r\n    Gathered Gold instead of Honey.\"\r\n\r\nIf a pound of West India honey costs about 6 cents, and the bees use, as\r\nthey will, about one pound to make the comb in which it is stored, it\r\ncosts the producer at least 12 cents a pound, and if to this, he adds,\r\nsay 5 cents more, for extra time and labor in feeding, then his inferior\r\nhoney costs him at least as much as the market price of the very best\r\nhoney on the spot where it is produced! If the bee-keeper allows his\r\nbees to make what they will, from the blossoms, and then begins to feed,\r\nafter he has harvested the produce from the natural supplies, the\r\nadvance over the first cost will hardly pay for the trouble, even if it\r\nwere fair to palm off such inferior honey as a first-rate article. If,\r\nhowever, bees are fed on this food very largely in the latter part of\r\nSummer, they will fill up their hive with it, before they put it into\r\nthe spare honey boxes, and the production of brood will often be most\r\nseriously interfered with, at a season of the year when it is important\r\nto have the hives well stocked with bees, that they may winter to the\r\nbest advantage.\r\n\r\nIf Apiarians are anxious to have large quantities of choice honey, let\r\nthem manage their bees so as to have powerful stocks in the early\r\nSpring, and they will then be able to have heavy purses and light\r\nconsciences into the bargain. I shall now show how liquid honey,\r\nexceedingly beautiful to the eye, and tempting to the taste, may be made\r\nto great advantage.\r\n\r\nDissolve two pounds of the purest white sugar, in as much hot water as\r\nwill be just necessary to reduce it to a syrup; take one pound of the\r\nnicest white clover honey, (any other light colored honey of good flavor\r\nwill answer,) and after warming it, add it to the sugar syrup, and stir\r\nthe contents. When cool, this compound will be pronounced, even by the\r\nbest judges of honey, to be one of the most luscious articles which they\r\never tasted; and will be, by almost every one, preferred to the unmixed\r\nhoney. Refined loaf sugar is a perfectly pure and inodorous sweet, and\r\none pound of honey will communicate the honey flavor, in high\r\nperfection, to twice that quantity of sugar: while the new article will\r\nbe destitute of that smarting taste which honey alone, so often has, and\r\nwill be often found to agree perfectly with those who cannot eat the\r\nclear honey with impunity. If those engaged in the artificial\r\nmanufacture of honey, never brought any thing worse than this, to the\r\nmarket, the purchasers would have no reason to complain. As however, the\r\ncompound can be furnished much cheaper than the pure honey, many may\r\nprefer to purchase the materials, and mix them themselves. If desired,\r\nany kind of flavor may be given to the manufactured article; thus it may\r\nbe made to resemble in fragrance, the classic honey of Mount Hymettus,\r\nby adding to it the fine aroma of the lemon balm, or wild thyme; or it\r\nmay have the flavor of the orange groves, or the delicate fragrance of\r\nbeds of roses washed with dew.\r\n\r\nI have recently ascertained that if two pounds of the best refined sugar\r\nbe added to one of common maple sugar, the compound will be a light\r\ncolored article, retaining perfectly the maple taste, and yet far\r\nsuperior to the common maple sugar. After making this discovery, I\r\nlearned that a large part of the very nicest maple sugar is made in this\r\nway!\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to feed to bees, to be stored in the honey\r\nboxes, a mixture of the whitest honey and loaf sugar; but the result\r\nshows a loss rather than a gain. The mixture, before it is fed, will\r\ncost about 10 cents per pound. At the very furthest, not more than one\r\nhalf of what is fed, can be secured in the comb, for it requires about\r\none pound of honey, to manufacture comb enough to hold a pound of honey.\r\nThe actual cost of the honey in the comb, will therefore be, at least 20\r\ncents per pound; and the pure white clover honey can be bought for less\r\nthan that. Those who desire to have something exceedingly beautiful to\r\nthe eye, and delicate to the taste, at a season when the bees are not\r\nstoring up honey from the blossoms, and in situations where the natural\r\nsupply is of an inferior quality, if they do not regard expense, can\r\nplace upon their tables, something which will be pronounced by the best\r\njudges, a little superior to any thing they ever tasted before.\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly spoken of the great care which is necessary to prevent\r\nbees from getting a taste of forbidden sweets, so as to be tempted to\r\nengage in dishonest courses. The experienced Apiarian will fully\r\nappreciate the necessity of these cautions, and the inexperienced, if\r\nthey neglect them, will be taught a lesson that they will not soon\r\nforget. Let it be remembered that the bee was intended to gather its\r\nsweets from the nectaries of flowers: to use the exquisitely beautiful\r\nlanguage of him whose wonderful writings supply us on almost every\r\nsubject, with the richest thoughts and happiest illustrations, they were\r\ncreated to\r\n\r\n    \"Make boot upon the Summer's velvet buds,\r\n    Which pillage they with merry march bring home\r\n    To the tent royal of their emperor:\r\n    Who, busied in his majesty, surveys\r\n    The singing masons, building roofs of gold.\"--_Shakspeare._\r\n\r\nWhen thus engaged, the bees work in perfect accordance with their\r\nnatural instincts, and seem to have little or no disposition to meddle\r\nwith property that does not belong to them. If however, their incautious\r\nowner tempts them with liquid food, especially at times when they can\r\nobtain nothing from the blossoms, they seem to be so infatuated with\r\nsuch easy gatherings, as to lose all discretion, and they will perish by\r\nthousands, if the vessels which contain the food are not furnished with\r\nfloats, on which they can stand and help themselves in safety.\r\n\r\nThe fly was intended to feed, not upon the blossoms, but upon food in\r\nwhich, without care, it could easily be drowned; and hence it alights\r\nmost cautiously, on the edge of any vessel containing liquid food, and\r\nwarily helps itself: while the poor bee, without any caution, plunges\r\nright in and speedily perishes. The sad fate of their unfortunate\r\ncompanions, does not in the least, deter others who approach the\r\ntempting lure: but they madly alight on the bodies of the dying and the\r\ndead, to share the same miserable end! No one can understand the full\r\nextent of their infatuation, until after seeing a confectioner's shop,\r\nassailed by thousands and tens of thousands of hungry bees. I have seen\r\nthousands strained out from the syrups in which they had perished;\r\nthousands more alighting even upon the boiling sweets; the floors\r\ncovered, and windows darkened with bees, some crawling, others flying,\r\nand others still, so completely daubed as to be able neither to crawl\r\nnor fly; not one bee in ten able to carry home its ill-gotten spoils,\r\nand yet the air filled with new hosts of thoughtless comers.\r\n\r\nIt will be for the interest of all engaged in the manufacture of candy\r\nand syrups, to fit gauze wire windows and doors to their premises, and\r\nthus save themselves from constant loss and annoyance: for if only one\r\nbee in a hundred escapes with his load, the confectioner will be\r\nsubjected in the course of the season to serious loss. I once furnished\r\nsuch an establishment, after the bees had commenced their depredations,\r\nwith such protection; and when they found themselves excluded, they lit\r\non the wire by thousands, and fairly squealed with vexation and\r\ndisappointment, as they tried to force a passage through the meshes. At\r\nlast as they were daring enough to descend the chimney, reeking with\r\nsweet odors, even although the most who attempted it, fell with scorched\r\nwings into the fire, it became necessary to put wire gauze over the top\r\nof the chimney also!\r\n\r\nHow often, as I have seen thousands of bees, in such places destroyed,\r\nand thousands more deprived of all ability to fly, and hopelessly\r\nstruggling in the deluding sweets, and yet thousands more blindly\r\nhovering over them, all unmindful of their danger, and apparently eager\r\nto share the same destruction, how often has the spectacle of their\r\ninfatuation seemed to me, to be an exact picture of the woful delusion\r\nof those who surrender themselves to the fatal influences of the\r\nintoxicating cup. Even although they see the miserable victims of this\r\ndegrading vice, falling all around them, into premature and dishonored\r\ngraves, they still press on, madly trampling as it were, over their dead\r\nand dying bodies, that they too may sink into the same abyss of agonies,\r\nand that their sun may also go down in darkness and hopeless gloom. Even\r\nalthough they know that the next cup may send them, with all their sins\r\nupon their heads, to the dread tribunal of their God, that cup of bitter\r\nsorrows and untold degradation, they will drain even to its most\r\nloathsome dregs.\r\n\r\nThe avaricious bee that despised the slow process of extracting nectar\r\nfrom \"every opening flower,\" and plunged recklessly into the tempting\r\nsweets, has ample time to bewail its folly. Even if it has not paid the\r\nforfeit of its life, but has been able to obtain its fill, it returns\r\nhome with all its beautiful plumage sullied and besmeared, and with a\r\nwoe-begone look, and sorrowful note, in marked contrast with the bright\r\nhues and merry sounds with which the industrious bee returns from its\r\nhappy rovings amid \"the budding honey flowers, and sweetly breathing\r\nfields.\"\r\n\r\nJust so, has many a pilgrim from the golden shores of California and\r\nAustralia, returned; enfeebled in body and mind, bankrupt often in\r\ncharacter and happiness, if not in purse, and unfitted in every way, for\r\nthe calm and sober pursuits of common industry; while thousands, yes,\r\nand tens of thousands too, shall never more behold their once happy\r\nhomes. Bibles and Sabbaths, altars and firesides, parents and friends,\r\nwife and children, how often have all these been wantonly abandoned, in\r\nthe accursed greed for gain, by those who might have been happy and\r\nprosperous at home, and who wandered from its sacred precincts only\r\nbecause they were determined to make the possession of wealth, the chief\r\nobject of life, but whose bones now lie amid the coral reefs of the\r\nocean, or moulder in the howling wastes of the \"overland passage;\" just\r\nas the bones of the unbelieving Israelites whitened the sands of the\r\ndesert. Of those who have reached the \"land of\" golden \"promise,\" how\r\nmany have died in despair, or worse still, are living so besotted by\r\nvice, so lost to all power of virtuous resolutions, that they shall\r\nnever more see the happy homes from which they so thoughtlessly\r\nwandered, never more hear the soft accents of loving friends; never more\r\nworship God, in a peaceful Sanctuary, or ever again behold an opened\r\nBible!\r\n\r\n    \"Gold!

PASTURAGE. OVERSTOCKING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on Feeding, it has already been stated that honey is not\r\na natural secretion of the bee, but a substance obtained from the\r\nnectaries of the blossoms; it is not therefore, made, but merely\r\ngathered by the bees. The truth is well expressed in the lines so\r\nfamiliar to most of us from our childhood,\r\n\r\n    \"How doth the little busy bee\r\n      Improve each shining hour,\r\n    And _gather_ honey all the day\r\n      From every opening flower.\"\r\n\r\nBees not only gather honey from the blossoms, but often obtain it in\r\nlarge quantities from what have been called honey dews; \"a term applied\r\nto those sweet, clammy drops that glitter on the foliage of many trees\r\nin hot weather.\" Two different opinions have been zealously advocated as\r\nto the origin of honey-dews. By some, they are considered a natural\r\nexudation from the leaves of trees, a perspiration as it were,\r\noccasioned often by ill health, though sometimes a provision to enable\r\nthe plants to resist the fervent heats to which they are exposed. Others\r\ninsist that this sweet substance is discharged from the bodies of those\r\naphides or small lice which infest the leaves of so many plants.\r\nUnquestionably they are produced in both ways.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Kirby and Spence, in their interesting work on Entomology, have\r\ngiven a description of the kind of honey-dew furnished by the aphides.\r\n\r\n\"The loves of the ants and the aphides have long been celebrated; and\r\nthat there is a connection between them, you may, at any time in the\r\nproper season, convince yourself; for you will always find the former\r\nvery busy on those trees and plants on which the latter abound; and if\r\nyou examine more closely, you will discover that the object of the ants,\r\nin thus attending upon the aphides, is to obtain the saccharine fluid\r\nsecreted by them, which may well be denominated their milk. This fluid,\r\nwhich is scarcely inferior to honey in sweetness, issues in limpid drops\r\nfrom the abdomen of these insects, not only by the ordinary passage, but\r\nalso by two setiform tubes placed, one on each side, just above it.\r\nTheir sucker being inserted in the tender bark, is without intermission\r\nemployed in absorbing the sap, which, after it has passed through their\r\nsystem, they keep continually discharging by these organs. When no ants\r\nattend them, by a certain jerk of the body, which takes place at regular\r\nintervals, they ejaculate it to a distance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Knight once observed,\" says Bevan, \"a shower of honey-dew\r\ndescending in innumerable small globules, near one of his oak-trees, _on\r\nthe 1st of September_; he cut off one of the branches, took it into the\r\nhouse, and holding it in a stream of light, which was purposely admitted\r\nthrough a small opening, distinctly saw the aphides ejecting the fluid\r\nfrom their bodies with considerable force, and this accounts for its\r\nbeing frequently found in situations where it could not have arrived by\r\nthe mere influence of gravitation. The drops that are thus spurted out,\r\nunless interrupted by the surrounding foliage, or some other interposing\r\nbody, fall upon the ground; and the spots may often be observed, for\r\nsome time, beneath and around the trees affected with honey-dew, till\r\nwashed away by the rain. The power which these insects possess of\r\nejecting the fluid from their bodies, seems to have been wisely\r\ninstituted to preserve cleanliness in each individual fly, and indeed\r\nfor the preservation of the whole family; for pressing as they do upon\r\none another, they would otherwise soon be glued together, and rendered\r\nincapable of stirring. On looking steadfastly at a group of these\r\ninsects (_Aphides Salicis_) while feeding on the bark of the willow,\r\ntheir superior size enables us to perceive some of them elevating their\r\nbodies and emitting a transparent substance in the form of a small\r\nshower.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Nor scorn ye now, fond elves, the foliage sear,\r\n    When the light aphids, arm'd with puny spear,\r\n    Probe each emulgent vein, till bright below,\r\n    Like falling stars, clear drops of nectar glow.\"\r\n                                             _Evans._\r\n\r\n\"The _willow_ accommodates the bees in a kind of threefold succession;\r\nfrom the flowers they obtain both honey and farina;--from the bark\r\npropolis;--and the leaves frequently afford them honey-dew at a time\r\nwhen other resources are beginning to fail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honey-dew usually appears upon the leaves as a viscid, transparent\r\nsubstance, as sweet as honey itself, sometimes in the form of globules,\r\nat others resembling a syrup; it is generally most abundant from the\r\nmiddle of June to the middle of July, sometimes as late as September.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is found chiefly upon the _oak_, the _elm_, the _maple_, the\r\n_plane_, the _sycamore_, the _lime_, the _hazel_, and the _blackberry_;\r\noccasionally also on the _cherry_, _currant_, and other fruit trees.\r\nSometimes only one species of trees is affected at a time. The oak\r\ngenerally affords the largest quantity. At the season of its greatest\r\nabundance, the happy humming noise of the bees may be heard at a\r\nconsiderable distance from the trees, sometimes nearly equalling in\r\nloudness the united hum of swarming.\"\r\n\r\nIn some seasons, extraordinary quantities of honey are furnished by the\r\nhoney-dews, and bees will often, in a few days, fill their hives with\r\nit. If at such times, they can be furnished with empty combs, the amount\r\nstored up by them, will be truly wonderful. No certain reliance,\r\nhowever, can be placed upon this article of bee-food, as in some years,\r\nthere is scarcely any to be found, and it is only once in three or four\r\nyears, that it is very abundant. The honey obtained from this source, is\r\ngenerally of a very good quality, though seldom as clear as that\r\ngathered from the choicest blossoms.\r\n\r\nThe quality of honey is exceedingly various, some being dark, and often\r\nbitter and disagreeable to the taste, while occasionally it is gathered\r\nfrom poisonous flowers, and is very noxious to the human system.\r\n\r\nAn intelligent Mandingo African informed a lady of my acquaintance, that\r\nthey do not in his country, dare to eat _unsealed_ honey, until it is\r\nfirst _boiled_. In some of the Southern States, all unsealed honey is\r\ngenerally rejected. It appears to me highly probable that the noxious\r\nqualities of the honey gathered from some flowers, is, for the most\r\npart, evaporated, before it is sealed over by the bees, while the honey\r\nis thickening in the cells. Boiling the honey, would, of course, expel\r\nit much more effectually, and it is a well ascertained fact that some\r\npersons are not able to eat even the best honey with impunity, until\r\nafter it has been boiled! I believe that if persons who are injured by\r\nhoney would subject it to this operation, they would usually find it to\r\nexert no injurious influence on the system. Honey is improved by age,\r\nand many are able to use with impunity, that which has been for a long\r\ntime, in the hive, and which seems to be much milder than any freshly\r\ngathered by the bees.\r\n\r\nHoney, when taken from the bees, should be carefully put where it will\r\nbe safe from all intruders, and where it will not be exposed to so low a\r\ntemperature as to candy in the cells. The little red ant, and the large\r\nblack ant are extravagantly fond of it, and unless placed where they\r\ncannot reach it, they will soon carry off large quantities. I paste\r\npaper over all my boxes, glasses, &c., so as to make them air-tight, and\r\ncarefully store them away for future use. If it is drained from the\r\ncombs, it may be kept in tight vessels, although in this state it will\r\nbe almost sure to candy. By putting the vessels in water, and bringing\r\nit to the boiling point, it will be as nice as when first strained from\r\nthe comb. In this way, I prefer to keep the larger portion of my honey.\r\nThe appearance of white honey in the comb, is however, so beautiful,\r\nthat many will prefer to keep it in this form, especially, if intended\r\nfor sale.\r\n\r\nIn my hives, it may be taken from the bees, in a great variety of ways.\r\nSome may prefer to construct the main hive in such a form, that the\r\nsurplus honey can be taken from it, on the frames. Others will prefer to\r\ntake it on frames put in an upper box; (see p. 231.) Glass vessels of\r\nalmost any size or form will make beautiful receptacles for the spare\r\nhoney. They ought always, however, to have a piece of comb fastened in\r\nthem, before they are given to the bees; (see p. 161) and if the weather\r\nis cool, they must be carefully covered with something warm, or they\r\nwill part with their heat so quickly, as to discourage the bees from\r\nbuilding in them. Unless warmly covered, glass vessels will often be so\r\nlined with moisture, as to annoy the bees. This is occasioned by the\r\nrapid evaporation of the water from the newly gathered honey, (see\r\np. 335.) All hives during the height of the gathering season, abound in\r\nmoisture, and this no doubt furnishes the bees, for the most part, with\r\nthe water they then need.\r\n\r\nHoney, when stored in a pint tumbler, just large enough to receive one\r\ncomb, has a most beautiful appearance, and may be easily taken out\r\nwhole, and placed in an elegant shape upon the table. The expense of\r\nsuch glass vessels is one objection to their use; the ease with which\r\nthey part with their heat, another, and a more serious objection still,\r\nis the fact that the shallow cells, so many of which must be made in a\r\nround vessel, require as large a consumption of honey for their wax\r\ncovers, as those which hold more than twice their quantity of honey.\r\n\r\nI prefer rectangular boxes made of pasteboard, to any other: they are\r\nneat, warm and cheap; and if a small piece of glass is pasted in one of\r\ntheir ends, the Apiarian can always see when they are full. When the\r\nhoney is taken from the bees, the box has its cover put on, and is\r\npasted tight, so as to exclude air and insects. In this form, honey may\r\nbe packed, and sent to market very conveniently: and when the boxes are\r\nopened, the purchaser can always see the quality of the article which he\r\nbuys. The box in which these small boxes of honey are packed in order to\r\nbe sent to market, should be furnished with rope handles, so that it can\r\nbe easily lifted, without the least jarring. Honey should be handled\r\nwith just as much care as glass. A box, four inches wide, will admit of\r\ntwo combs, and if small pieces of comb are put in the top, the bees will\r\nbuild them, of the proper dimensions, and will thus make them too large\r\nfor brood combs, and of the best size to contain their surplus honey.\r\nThe use of my hives enables the Apiarian to get access to all the comb\r\nwhich he needs for such purposes, and he will find it to his interest,\r\nnever to give the bees a box which does not contain some comb, as well\r\nfor encouragement as for a pattern. I have never seen the use of\r\npasteboard boxes suggested, but after experimenting with a great many\r\nmaterials, I believe they will be found, all things considered,\r\npreferable to any others. Wooden boxes, with a piece of glass, are very\r\ngood for storing honey: but they are much more expensive than those made\r\nof pasteboard, and the covers cannot be removed so conveniently.\r\n\r\nHoney may be safely removed from the surplus honey boxes of my hives,\r\neven by the most timid. When the outside case which covers the boxes, is\r\nelevated, a shield is thrown between the Apiarian and the bees which are\r\nentering and leaving the hive. Before removing a vessel or box, a thin\r\nknife should be carefully passed under it, so as to loosen the\r\nattachments of the comb to the honey-board, without injuring the bees;\r\nthen a small piece of tin or zinc may be pushed under to prevent the\r\nbees that are below, from coming up, when the honey is removed. The\r\nApiarian should now tap gently on the box, and the bees in it,\r\nperceiving that they are separated from the main hive, will at once\r\nproceed to fill themselves, so as to save as much as possible, of their\r\nprecious sweets. In about five minutes, or as soon as they are full, and\r\nrun over the combs, trying to get out, the glass or box may at once be\r\nremoved, and they will fly directly to the hive with what they have been\r\nable to secure. Bees under such circumstances, _never_ attempt to sting,\r\nand a child of ten years, may remove, with ease and safety, all their\r\nsurplus stores. If a person is too timid to approach a hive when any\r\nbees are flying, the honey may be removed towards evening, or early in\r\nthe morning, before the bees are flying, in any considerable numbers. In\r\nperforming this operation, it should always be borne in mind, that\r\nlarge quantities of honey should never be taken from them at once,\r\nunless when the honey-harvest is over. Bees are exceedingly discouraged\r\nby such wholesale appropriations, and often refuse entirely, to work in\r\nthe empty boxes, even although honey abounds in the fields. Not\r\nunfrequently when large boxes are removed, and being found only\r\npartially filled, are returned, the bees will carry every particle of\r\nhoney down into the main hive! If, however, the honey is removed in\r\nsmall boxes, one at a time, and an empty box with guide comb is put\r\ninstantly in its place, the bees, so far from being discouraged, work\r\nwith more than their wonted energy, and usually begin in a few hours, to\r\nenlarge the comb.\r\n\r\nI would here repeat the caution already given, against needlessly\r\nopening and shutting the hives, or in any way meddling with the bees so\r\nas to make them feel insecure in their possessions. Such a course tends\r\nto discourage them, and may seriously diminish the yield of honey.\r\n\r\nIf the Apiarian wishes to remove honey from the interior of the hive, he\r\nmust remove the combs, as directed on page 195, and shake the bees off,\r\non the alighting board, or directly into the hive.\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTURAGE.\r\n\r\nSome blossoms yield only pollen, and others only honey; but by far the\r\nlargest number, both honey and pollen. Since the discovery that rye\r\nflour will answer so admirably as a substitute, before the bees are able\r\nto gather the pollen from the flowers, early blossoms producing pollen\r\nalone, are not so important in the vicinity of an Apiary. Willows are\r\namong the most desirable trees to have within reach of the bees: some\r\nkinds of willow put out their catkins very early, and yield an\r\nabundance of both bee-bread and honey. All the willows furnish an\r\nabundance of food for the bees; and as there is considerable difference\r\nin the time of their blossoming, it is desirable to have such varieties\r\nas will furnish the bees with food, as long as possible.\r\n\r\nThe Sugar Maple furnishes a large supply of very delicious honey, and\r\nits blossoms hanging in drooping fringes, will be all alive with bees.\r\nThe Apricot, Peach, Plum and Cherry are much frequented by the bees;\r\nPears and Apples furnish very copious supplies of the richest honey. The\r\nTulip tree, _Liriodendron_, is probably one of the greatest\r\nhoney-producing trees in the world. In rich lands this magnificent tree\r\nwill grow over one hundred feet high, and when covered with its large\r\nbell-shaped blossoms of mingled green and golden yellow, it is one of\r\nthe most beautiful trees in the world. The blossoms are expanding in\r\nsuccession, often for more than two weeks, and a new swarm will\r\nfrequently fill its hive from these trees alone. The honey though dark\r\nin color, is of a rich flavor. This tree has been successfully\r\ncultivated as a shade tree, even as far North as Southern Vermont, and\r\nfor the extraordinary beauty of its foliage and blossoms, deserves to be\r\nintroduced wherever it can be made to grow. The Winter of 1851-2, was\r\nexceedingly cold, the thermometer in Greenfield, Mass. sinking as low as\r\n30° below zero, and yet a tulip tree not only survived the Winter\r\nuninjured, but was covered the following season with blossoms.\r\n\r\nThe American Linden or Bass Wood, is another tree which yields large\r\nsupplies of very pure and white honey. It is one of our most beautiful\r\nnative trees, and ought to be planted much more extensively than it is,\r\nin our villages and country seats. The English Linden is worthless for\r\nbees, and in many places, has been so infested by worms, as to make it\r\nnecessary to cut it down.\r\n\r\nThe Linden blossoms soon after the white clover begins to fail, and a\r\nmajestic tree covered with its yellow clusters, at a season when very\r\nfew blossoms are to be seen, is a sight most beautiful and refreshing.\r\n\r\n    \"Here their delicious task, the fervent bees\r\n    In swarming millions tend: around, athwart,\r\n    Through the soft air the busy nations fly,\r\n    Cling to the bud, and with inserted tube,\r\n    Suck its pure essence, its etherial soul.\"\r\n                                     _Thomson._\r\n\r\nOur villages would be much more attractive, if instead of being filled\r\nas they often are, almost exclusively with maples and elms, they were\r\nadorned with a greater variety of our native trees. The remark has often\r\nbeen made, that these trees are much more highly valued abroad than at\r\nhome, and that to see them in perfection, we must either visit their\r\nnative forests, or the pleasure grounds of some wealthy English or\r\nEuropean gentleman.\r\n\r\nOf all the various sources from which the bees derive their supplies,\r\nwhite clover is the most important. It yields large quantities of very\r\nwhite honey, and of the purest quality, and wherever it flourishes in\r\nabundance, the honey-bee will always gather a rich harvest. In this\r\ncountry at least, it seems to be the most certain reliance of the\r\nApiary. It blossoms at a season of the year when the weather is usually\r\nboth dry and hot, and the bees gather the honey from it, after the sun\r\nhas dried off the dew: so that its juices are very thick, and almost\r\nready to be sealed over at once in the cells.\r\n\r\nEvery observant bee-keeper must have noticed, that in some seasons, the\r\nblossoms of various kinds yield much less honey than in others. Perhaps\r\nno plant varies so little in this respect, as the white clover. This\r\nclover ought to be much more extensively cultivated than it now is, and\r\nI consider myself as conferring a benefit not only on bee-keepers, but\r\non the agricultural community at large, in being able to state on the\r\nauthority of one of New England's ablest practical farmers, and writers\r\non agricultural subjects, Hon. Frederick Holbrook, of Brattleboro',\r\nVermont, that the common white clover may be cultivated on some soils to\r\nvery great profit, as a hay crop. In an article for the New England\r\nFarmer, for May, 1853, he speaks as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The more general sowing of white clover-seed is confidently\r\nrecommended. If land is in good heart at the time of stocking it to\r\ngrass, white clover sown with the other grass-seeds will thicken up the\r\nbottom of mowings, growing some eight or ten inches high and in a thick\r\nmat, and the burden of hay will prove much heavier than it seemed likely\r\nto be before mowing. Soon after the practice of sowing white clover on\r\nthe tillage-fields commences, the plant will begin to show itself in\r\nvarious places on the farm, and ultimately gets pretty well scattered\r\nover the pastures, as it seeds very profusely, and the seeds are carried\r\nfrom place to place in the manure and otherwise. The price of the seed\r\nper pound in market is high; but then one pound of it will seed more\r\nland, than two pounds of red clover seed; so that in fact the former is\r\nthe cheaper seed of the two, for an acre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Red-top, red clover and white clover seeds, sown together, produce a\r\nquality of hay universally relished by stock. My practice is, to seed\r\nall dry, sandy and gravelly lands with this mixture. The red and white\r\nclover pretty much make the crop the first year; the second year, the\r\nred clover begins to disappear, and the red-top to take its place; and\r\nafter that, the red-top and white clover have full possession and make\r\nthe very best hay for horses or oxen, milch cows or young stock, that I\r\nhave been able to produce. The crop per acre, as compared with\r\nherds-grass, is not so bulky; but tested by weight and by spending\r\nquality in the Winter, it is much the most valuable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Herds-grass hay grown on moist uplands or reclaimed meadows, and swamps\r\nof a mucky soil, or lands not overcharged with silica, is of good\r\nquality; but when grown on sandy and gravelly soils abounding in silex,\r\nthe stalks are hard, wiry, coated with silicates as with glass, and\r\nneither horses nor cattle will eat it as well, or thrive as well on it\r\nas on hay made of red-top and clover; and as for milch cows, they winter\r\nbadly on it, and do not give out the milk as when fed on softer and more\r\nsucculent hay.\"\r\n\r\nBy managing white clover, according to Mr. Holbrook's plan, it might be\r\nmade to blossom abundantly in the second crop, and thus lengthen out, to\r\nvery great advantage, the pasture for the bees. For fear that any of my\r\nreaders might suspect Mr. Holbrook of looking at the white clover,\r\nthrough a pair of _bee-spectacles_, I would add that although he has ten\r\nacres of it in mowing, he has no bees, and has never particularly\r\ninterested himself in this branch of rural economy. When we can succeed\r\nin directing the attention of such men to bee-culture, we may hope to\r\nsee as rapid an advance in this as in some other important branches of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nSweet-scented clover, (_Mellilotus Leucantha_,) affords a rich\r\nbee-pasturage. It blossoms the second year from the seed, and grows to a\r\ngreat height, and is always swarming with bees until quite late in the\r\nFall. Attempts have been made to cultivate it for the sake of its value\r\nas a hay crop, but it has been found too coarse in its texture, to be\r\nvery profitable. Where many bees are kept, it might however, be so\r\nvaluable for them as to justify its extensive cultivation. During the\r\nearly part of the season, it might be mowed and fed to the cattle, in a\r\ngreen and tender state, and allowed to blossom later in the season,\r\nwhen the bees can find but few sources to gather from.\r\n\r\nFor years, I have attempted to procure, through botanists, a hybrid or\r\ncross between the red and white clover, in order to get something with\r\nthe rich honey-producing properties of the red, and yet with a short\r\nblossom into which the honey-bee might insert its proboscis. The red\r\nclover produces a vast amount of food for the bumble-bee, but is of no\r\nuse at all to the honey-bee. I had hoped to procure a variety which\r\nmight answer all the purposes of our farmers as a field crop. Quite\r\nrecently I have ascertained that such a hybrid has been originated in\r\nSweden, and has been imported into this country, by Mr. B. C. Rogers, of\r\nPhiladelphia. It grows even taller than the red clover, bears many\r\nblossoms on a stalk which are small, resembling the white, and is said\r\nto be preferred by cattle, to any other kind of grass, while it answers\r\nadmirably for bees.\r\n\r\nBuckwheat furnishes a most excellent Fall feed for bees; the honey is\r\nnot so well-flavored as some other kinds, but it comes at a season when\r\nit is highly important to the bees, and they are often able to fill\r\ntheir hives with a generous supply against Winter. Buckwheat honey is\r\ngathered when the dew is upon the blossoms, and instead of being thick,\r\nlike white clover honey, is often quite thin; the bees sweat out a large\r\nportion of its moisture, but still they do not exhaust the whole of it,\r\nand in wet seasons especially, it is liable to sour in the cells. Honey\r\ngathered in a dry season, is always thicker, and of course more valuable\r\nthan that gathered in a wet one, as it contains much less water.\r\nBuckwheat is uncertain in its honey-bearing qualities; in some seasons,\r\nit yields next to none, and hardly a bee will be seen upon a large\r\nfield, while in others, it furnishes an extraordinary supply. The most\r\npractical and scientific agriculturists agree that so far from being an\r\nimpoverishing crop, it is on many soils, one of the most profitable that\r\ncan be raised. Every bee-keeper should have some in the vicinity of his\r\nhives.\r\n\r\nThe raspberry, it is well known, is a great favorite with the bees; and\r\nthe honey supplied by it, is very delicious. Those parts of New England,\r\nwhich are hilly and rough, are often covered with the wild raspberry,\r\nand would furnish food for numerous colonies of bees.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that thus far, I have said nothing about cultivating\r\nflowers in the garden, to supply the bees with food. What can be done in\r\nthis way, is of scarcely any account; and it would be almost as\r\nreasonable to expect to furnish food for a stock of cattle, from a small\r\ngrass plat, as honey for bees, from garden plants. The cultivation of\r\nbee-flowers is more a matter of pleasure than profit, to those who like\r\nto hear the happy hum of the busy bees, as they walk in their gardens.\r\nIt hardly seems expedient, at least for the present, to cultivate any\r\nfield crops except such as are profitable in themselves, without any\r\nreference to the bees.\r\n\r\nMignonnette is excellent for bees, but of all flowers, none seems to\r\nequal the Borage. It blossoms in June, and continues in bloom until\r\nsevere frost, and is always covered with bees, even in dull weather, as\r\nits pendant blossoms keep the honey from the moisture; the honey yielded\r\nby it, is of a very superior quality. If any plant which does not in\r\nitself make a valuable crop, would justify cultivation, there is no\r\ndoubt that borage would. An acre of it would support a large number of\r\nstocks. If in a village those who keep bees would unite together and\r\nsecure the sowing of an acre, in their immediate vicinity, each person\r\npaying in proportion to the number of stocks kept, it might be found\r\nprofitable. The plants should have about two feet of space every way,\r\nand after they covered the ground, would need no further attention. They\r\nwould come into full blossom, cultivated in this manner, about the time\r\nthat the white clover begins to fail, and would not only furnish rich\r\npasture for the bees, but would keep them from the groceries and shops\r\nin which so many perish.\r\n\r\nIf those who are engaged in adorning our villages and country residences\r\nwith shade trees, would be careful to set out a liberal allowance of\r\nsuch kinds as are not only beautiful to us, but attractive to the bees,\r\nin process of time the honey resources of the country might be very\r\ngreatly increased.\r\n\r\n\r\nOVERSTOCKING A DISTRICT WITH BEES.\r\n\r\nI come now to a point of the very first importance to all interested in\r\nthe cultivation of bees. If the opinions which the great majority of\r\nAmerican bee-keepers entertain, are correct, then the keeping of bees\r\nmust, in our country, be always an insignificant pursuit. I confess that\r\nI find it difficult to repress a smile, when the owner of a few hives,\r\nin a district where as many hundreds might be made to prosper, gravely\r\nimputes his ill success, to the fact that too many bees are kept in his\r\nvicinity! The truth is, that as bees are frequently managed, they are of\r\nbut little value, even though in \"a land flowing with milk and honey.\"\r\nIf in the Spring, a colony of bees is prosperous and healthy, (see p.\r\n207) it will gather abundant stores, even if hundreds equally strong,\r\nare in its immediate vicinity, while if it is feeble, it will be of\r\nlittle or no value, even if there is not another swarm within a dozen\r\nmiles of it.\r\n\r\nSuccess in bee-keeping requires that a man should be in some things, a\r\nvery close imitator of Napoleon, who always aimed to have an\r\noverwhelming force, at the right time and in the right place; so the\r\nbee-keeper must be sure that his colonies are numerous, just at the time\r\nwhen their numbers can be turned to the best account. If the bees cannot\r\nget up their numbers until the honey-harvest is well nigh gone, numbers\r\nwill then be of as little service as many of the famous armies against\r\nwhich \"the soldier of Europe\" contended; which, after the fortunes of\r\nthe campaign were decided, only served to swell the triumphant spoils of\r\nthe mighty conqueror. A bee-keeper with feeble stocks in the Spring,\r\nwhich become strong only when there is nothing to get, is like a farmer\r\nwho contrives to hire no hands to reap his harvests, but suffers the\r\ncrops to rot upon the ground, and then at great expense, hires a number\r\nof stalworth laborers to idle about his premises and eat him out of\r\nhouse and home!\r\n\r\nI do not believe that there is a _single square mile_ in this whole\r\ncountry, which is overstocked with bees, unless it is one so unsuitable\r\nfor bee-keeping as to make it unprofitable to attempt it at all. Such an\r\nassertion will doubtless, appear to many, very unguarded; and yet it is\r\nmade advisedly, and I am happy to be able to confirm it, by reference to\r\nthe experience of the largest cultivators in Europe. The following\r\nletter from Mr. Wagner, will I trust, do more than I can possibly do in\r\nany other way, to show our bee-keepers how mistaken they are in their\r\nopinion as to the danger of overstocking their districts, and also what\r\nlarge results might be obtained from a more extensive cultivation of\r\nbees.\r\n\r\n                                        YORK, March 16, 1853.\r\n    DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\nIn reply to your enquiry respecting the _overstocking_ of a district, I\r\nwould say that the present opinion of the correspondents of the\r\nBienenzeitung, appears to be that it _cannot readily be done_. Dzierzon\r\nsays, in practice at least, \"_it never is done_;\" and Dr. Radlkofer, of\r\nMunich, the President of the second Apiarian Convention, declares that\r\nhis apprehensions on that score were dissipated by observations which he\r\nhad opportunity and occasion to make, when on his way home from the\r\nConvention. I have numerous accounts of Apiaries in pretty close\r\nproximity, containing from 200 to 300 colonies each. Ehrenfels had a\r\nthousand hives, at three separate establishments indeed, but so close to\r\neach other that he could visit them all in half an hour's ride; and he\r\nsays that in 1801, the average net yield of his Apiaries was $2 per\r\nhive. In Russia and Hungary, Apiaries numbering from 2000 to 5000\r\ncolonies are said not to be unfrequent; and we know that as many as 4000\r\nhives are oftentimes congregated, in Autumn, at one point on the heaths\r\nof Germany. Hence I think we need not fear that any district of this\r\ncountry, so distinguished for abundant natural vegetation and\r\ndiversified culture, will very speedily be overstocked, particularly\r\nafter the importance of having stocks populous early in the Spring,\r\ncomes to be duly appreciated. A week or ten days of favorable weather,\r\nat that season, when pasturage abounds, will enable a _strong_ colony to\r\nlay up an ample supply for the year, if its labor be properly directed.\r\n\r\nMr. Kaden, one of the ablest contributors to the Bienenzeitung, in the\r\nnumber for December, 1852, noticing the communication from Dr.\r\nRadlkofer, says: \"I also concur in the opinion that a district of\r\ncountry cannot be overstocked with bees; and that, however numerous the\r\ncolonies, all can procure sufficient sustenance if the surrounding\r\ncountry contain honey-yielding plants and vegetables, in the usual\r\ndegree. Where utter barrenness prevails, the case is different, of\r\ncourse, as well as rare.\"\r\n\r\nThe Fifteenth Annual Meeting of German Agriculturists was held in the\r\nCity of Hanover, on the 10th of September, 1852, and in compliance with\r\nthe suggestions of the Apiarian Convention, a distinct section devoted\r\nto bee-culture was instituted. The programme propounded sixteen\r\nquestions for discussion, the fourth of which was as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Can a district of country embracing meadows, arable land, orchards, and\r\nwoodlands or forests, be so overstocked with bees, that these may no\r\nlonger find adequate sustenance and yield a remunerating surplus of\r\ntheir products?\"\r\n\r\nThis question was debated with considerable animation. The Rev. Mr.\r\nKleine, (nine-tenths of the correspondents of the Bee-Journal are\r\nclergyman,) President of the section, gave it as his opinion that \"it\r\nwas hardly conceivable that such a country could be overstocked with\r\nbees.\" Counsellor Herwig, and the Rev. Mr. Wilkens, on the contrary,\r\nmaintained that \"it might be overstocked.\" In reply, Assessor Heyne\r\nremarked that \"whatever might be supposed possible as an extreme case,\r\nit was certain that as regards the kingdom of Hanover, it could not be\r\neven remotely apprehended that too many Apiaries would ever be\r\nestablished; and that consequently the greatest possible multiplication\r\nof colonies might safely be aimed at and encouraged.\" At the same time,\r\nhe advised a proper distribution of Apiaries.\r\n\r\nI might easily furnish you with more matter of this sort, and designate\r\na considerable number of Apiaries in various parts of Germany,\r\ncontaining from 25 to 500 colonies. But the question would still recur,\r\ndo not these Apiaries occupy comparatively isolated positions? and at\r\nthis distance from the scene, it would obviously be impossible to give a\r\nperfectly satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\nAccording to the statistical tables of the kingdom of Hannover, the\r\nannual production of bees-wax in the province of Lunenburg, is 300,000\r\nlbs., about one half of which is exported; and assuming one pound of wax\r\nas the yield of each hive, we must suppose that 300,000 hives are\r\nannually \"_brimstoned_\" in the province; and assuming further, in view\r\nof casualties, local influences, unfavorable seasons, &c., that only\r\none-half of the whole number of colonies maintained, produce a swarm\r\neach, every year, it would require a total of at least 600,000 colonies,\r\n(141, to each square mile,) to secure the result given in the tables.\r\n\r\nThe number of square miles stocked even to this extent, in this country,\r\nare, I suspect, \"few and far between.\" The Shakers at Lebanon, have\r\nabout 600 colonies; but I doubt whether a dozen Apiaries equally large\r\ncan be found in the Union. It is very evident, that this country is far\r\nfrom being overstocked; nor it is likely that it ever will be.\r\n\r\nA German writer alleges that \"the bees of Lunenburg, pay all the taxes\r\nassessed on their proprietors, and leave a surplus besides.\" The\r\nimportance attached to bee-culture accounts in part for the remarkable\r\nfact that the people of a district so barren that it has been called\r\n\"the Arabia of Germany,\" are almost without exception in easy and\r\ncomfortable circumstances. Could not still more favorable results be\r\nobtained in this country under a rational system of management, availing\r\nitself of the aid of science, art and skill?\r\n\r\nBut, I am digressing. My design was to furnish you with an account of\r\nbee-culture as it exists _in an entire district of country_, in the\r\nhands of _the common peasantry_. This I thought would be more\r\nsatisfactory, and convey a better idea of what may be done on a large\r\nscale, than any number of instances which might be selected of splendid\r\nsuccess in isolated cases.\r\n\r\n                        Very truly yours,\r\n                                   SAMUEL WAGNER.\r\n    REV. L. L. LANGSTROTH.\r\n\r\nThe question how far bees will fly in search of honey, has been very\r\ndifferently answered by different Apiarians. I am satisfied that they\r\nwill fly over three miles in search of food, but I believe as a general\r\nrule, that if their food is not within a circle of about two miles in\r\nevery direction from the Apiary, they will be able to store up but\r\nlittle surplus honey. The nearer, the better. In all my arrangements,\r\n(see p. 96.) I have made it a constant study to save _every step_ for\r\nthe bees that I possibly can, economizing to the very utmost, their\r\ntime, which will all be transmuted into honey; an inspection of the\r\nFrontispiece of this treatise will exhibit the general aspect of the\r\nalighting board of my hives, and will show the intelligent Apiarian,\r\nwith what ease bees will enter such a hive, even in very windy weather.\r\nBy such arrangements, they will be able to store up more honey, even if\r\nthey have to go a considerable distance in search of it, than they would\r\nin many other hives, when the honey abounded in their more immediate\r\nvicinity. Such considerations are entirely overlooked, by most\r\nbee-keepers, and they seem to imagine that they are matters of no\r\nimportance. By the utter neglect of any kind of precautions to\r\nfacilitate the labors of their bees, you might suppose that they\r\nimagined these delicate insects to be possessed of nerves of steel and\r\nsinews of iron or adamant; or else that they took them for miniature\r\nlocomotives, always fired up and capable of an indefinite amount of\r\nexertion. A bee _cannot_ put forth more than a certain amount of\r\nphysical exertion, and if a large portion of this is spent in absolutely\r\nfighting against difficulties, from which it might easily be guarded, it\r\nmust be very obvious to any one who thinks on the subject at all, that a\r\ngreat loss must be sustained by its owner.\r\n\r\nIf some of these thoughtless owners returning home with a heavy burden,\r\nwere compelled to fall down stairs half a dozen times before they could\r\nget into the house, they might perhaps think it best to guard their\r\nindustrious workers against such discouraging accidents. If bees are\r\ntossed violently about by the winds, as they attempt to enter their\r\nhives, they are often fatally injured, and the whole colony so\r\n_discouraged_, to say nothing more, that they do not gather near so much\r\nas they otherwise would.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of my Protector is such that the bees, if blown down,\r\nfall upon a sloping bank of soft grass, and are able to enter the hives\r\nwithout much inconvenience.\r\n\r\nJust as soon as our cultivators can be convinced, by practical results,\r\nthat bee-keeping, for the capital invested, may be made a most\r\nprofitable branch of rural economy, they will see the importance of\r\nputting their bees into suitable hives, and of doing all that they can,\r\nto give them a fair chance; until then, the mass of them will follow the\r\nbeaten track, and attribute their ill success, not to their own\r\nignorance, carelessness or stupidity, but to their want of \"luck,\" or to\r\nthe overstocking of the country with bees. I hope, before many years, to\r\nsee the price of good honey so reduced that the poor man can place it on\r\nhis table and feast upon it, as one of the cheapest luxuries within his\r\nreach.\r\n\r\nOn page 20, a statement was given of Dzierzon's experience as to the\r\nprofits of bee-keeping. The section of country in which he resides, is\r\nregarded by him as unfavorable to Apiarian pursuits. I shall now give\r\nwhat I consider a safe estimate for almost any section in our country;\r\nwhile in unusually favorable locations it will fall far below the\r\nresults which may be attained. It is based upon the supposition that the\r\nbees are kept in properly constructed hives so as to be strong early in\r\nthe season, and that the increase of stocks is limited to one new one\r\nfrom two old ones. Under proper management, one year with another,\r\nabout ten dollars worth of honey may be obtained for every two stocks\r\nwintered over. The worth of the new colonies, I set off as an equivalent\r\nfor labor of superintendence, and interest on the money invested in\r\nbees, hives, fixtures, &c.\r\n\r\nA careful, prudent man who will enter into bee-keeping moderately at\r\nfirst, and extend his operations only as his skill and experience\r\nincrease, will, by the use of my hives, find that the preceding estimate\r\nis not too large. Even on the ordinary mode of bee-keeping, there are\r\nmany who will consider it rather below than above the mark. If\r\nthoroughly careless persons are determined to \"try their luck,\" as they\r\ncall it, with bees, I advise them by all means, in mercy to the bees, to\r\nadopt the non-swarming plan. Improved methods of management with such\r\npersons will be of little or no use, unless you could improve their\r\nhabits first, and very often their brains too! Every dollar that such\r\npersons spend upon bees, unless with the slightest possible departure\r\nfrom the old-fashioned plans, is a dollar worse than thrown away. In\r\nthose parts of Europe where bee-keeping is carried on upon the largest\r\nscale, the mass adhere to the old system; this they understand, and by\r\nthis they secure a certainty, whereas in our country, thousands have\r\nbeen induced to enter upon the wildest schemes, or at least to use hives\r\nwhich could not furnish them the very information needed for their\r\nsuccessful management. A simple box furnished with my frames, will\r\nenable the masses, without departing materially from the common system,\r\nto increase largely the yield from their bees.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the information given in the Introduction, respecting the\r\nsuccess of Dzierzon's system of management, I have recently ascertained\r\nthat one of its ablest opponents in Germany, has become thoroughly\r\nconvinced of its superior value. The Government of Norway has\r\nappropriated $300, per annum, for the ensuing three years, towards\r\ndiffusing a knowledge of Dzierzon's method, in that country; having\r\npreviously despatched Mr. Hanser, Collector of Customs, to Silesia to\r\nvisit Mr. Dzierzon, and acquire a practical knowledge of his system of\r\nmanagement. He is now employed in distributing model hives, in the\r\nprovinces, and imparting information on improved bee-culture.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--The time has hardly come when the attention of any of our\r\n    State authorities can be attracted to the importance of bee-culture.\r\n    It is only of late that they have seemed to manifest any peculiar\r\n    interest in promoting the advancement of agricultural pursuits. A\r\n    Department of Agriculture ought to have been established, years ago,\r\n    by the National Government at Washington. Let us hope that the\r\n    Administration now in power, will establish a lasting claim to the\r\n    gratitude of posterity, by taking wise and efficient steps to\r\n    advance the agricultural interests of the country. A National\r\n    Society to promote these interests has recently been established,\r\n    and much may be hoped from its wisdom and energy. Until some\r\n    disinterested tribunal can be established, before which all\r\n    inventions and discoveries can be fairly tested, honest men will\r\n    suffer, and ignorance and imposture will continue to flourish. Lying\r\n    advertisements and the plausible misrepresentations of brazen-faced\r\n    impostors, will still drain the purses of the credulous, while\r\n    thousands, disgusted with the horde of impositions which are palmed\r\n    off upon the community, will settle down into a dogged determination\r\n    to try nothing new. A society before which every thing, claiming to\r\n    be an improvement in rural economy, could be fairly tested, would\r\n    undoubtedly be shunned by ignorant and unprincipled men, who now find\r\n    it an easy task to procure any number of certificates, but who dread\r\n    nothing so much as honest and intelligent investigation. The reports\r\n    of such a society after the most thorough trials and examinations,\r\n    would inspire confidence, save the community from severe losses, and\r\n    encourage the ablest minds to devote their best energies to the\r\n    improvement of agricultural implements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE ANGER OF BEES. REMEDY FOR THEIR STING. BEE-DRESS. INSTINCTS OF BEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the bee was disposed to use, without any provocation, the effective\r\nweapon with which it has been provided, its domestication would be\r\nentirely out of the question. The same remark however, is equally true\r\nof the ox, the horse or the dog. If these faithful servants of man were\r\nrespectively determined to use, to the very utmost their horns, their\r\nheels and their teeth, to his injury, he would never have been able to\r\nsubject them to his peaceful authority. The gentleness of the honey-bee,\r\nwhen kindly treated, and managed by those who properly understand its\r\ninstincts, has in this treatise been frequently spoken of, and is truly\r\nastonishing. They will, especially in swarming time, or whenever they\r\nare gorged with honey, allow any amount of handling which does not hurt\r\nthem, without the slightest show of anger. For the gratification of\r\nothers, I have frequently taken them up, by handfuls, suffered them to\r\nrun over my face, and even smoothed down their glossy backs as they\r\nrested on my person! Standing before the hives, I have, by a rapid sweep\r\nof my hands, caught numbers of them at once, just as though they were so\r\nmany harmless flies, and allowed them, one by one, to crawl out, by the\r\nsmallest opening, to the light of day; and I have even gone so far as to\r\nimitate many of the feats which the celebrated English Apiarian,\r\nWildman, was accustomed to perform; who having once secured the queen of\r\na hive, could make the bees cluster on his head, or hang, like a flowing\r\nbeard, in large festoons, from his chin. Wildman, for a long time, made\r\nas great a mystery of his wonderful performances, as the spirit-rappers\r\nof the present day, do of theirs; but at last, he was induced to explain\r\nhis whole mode of procedure; and the magic control which he possessed\r\nover the bees, and which was, by the ignorant, ascribed to his having\r\nbewitched them, was found to be owing entirely to his superior\r\nacquaintance with their instincts, and his uncommon dexterity and\r\nboldness.\r\n\r\n    \"Such was the spell, which round a Wildman's arm\r\n    Twin'd in dark wreaths the fascinated swarm;\r\n    Bright o'er his breast the glittering legions led,\r\n    Or with a living garland bound his head.\r\n    His dextrous hand, with firm yet hurtless hold,\r\n    Could seize the chief, known by her scales of gold,\r\n    Prune 'mid the wondering train her filmy wing,\r\n    Or o'er her folds the silken fetter fling.\"\r\n                                             _Evans._\r\n\r\nM. Lombard, a skillful French Apiarian narrates the following\r\ninteresting occurrence, which shows how peaceable bees are in swarming\r\ntime, and how easily managed by those who have both skill and\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\n\"A young girl of my acquaintance,\" he says, \"was greatly afraid of bees,\r\nbut was completely cured of her fear by the following incident. A swarm\r\nhaving come off, I observed the queen alight by herself at a little\r\ndistance from the Apiary. I immediately called my little friend that I\r\nmight show her the queen; she wished to see her more nearly, so after\r\nhaving caused her to put on her gloves, I gave the queen into her hand.\r\nWe were in an instant surrounded by the whole bees of the swarm. In this\r\nemergency I encouraged the girl to be steady, bidding her be silent and\r\nfear nothing, and remaining myself close by her; I then made her stretch\r\nout her right hand, which held the queen, and covered her head and\r\nshoulders with a very thin handkerchief. The swarm soon fixed on her\r\nhand and hung from it, as from the branch of a tree. The little girl was\r\ndelighted above measure at the novel sight, and so entirely freed from\r\nall fear, that she bade me uncover her face. The spectators were charmed\r\nwith the interesting spectacle. At length I brought a hive, and shaking\r\nthe swarm from the child's hand, it was lodged in safety, and without\r\ninflicting a single wound.\"\r\n\r\nThe indisposition of bees to sting, when swarming, is a fact familiar to\r\nevery practical bee-keeper: but I have not in all my reading or\r\nacquaintance with Apiarians, ever met with a single observation which\r\nhas convinced me that the philosophy of this strange fact was thoroughly\r\nunderstood. As far as I know, I am the only person who has ever\r\nascertained that when bees are filled with honey, they lose all\r\ndisposition to volunteer an assault, and who has made this curious law\r\nthe foundation of an extensive and valuable system of practical\r\nmanagement. It was only after I had thoroughly tested its universality\r\nand importance, that I began to feel the desirableness of obtaining a\r\nperfect control over each comb in the hive; for it was only then that I\r\nsaw that such control might be made available, in the hands of any one\r\nwho could manage bees in the ordinary way. The result of my whole\r\nsystem, is to make the bees unusually gentle, so that they are not only\r\npeaceable when any necessary operation is being performed, but at all\r\nother times. Even if I could open hives and safely manage at pleasure,\r\nstill if the result of such proceedings was to leave the bees in an\r\nexcited state, so as to make them unusually irritable, it would all\r\navail but very little.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one difficulty in managing bees so as not to incur\r\nthe risk of being stung at all, which attaches to every system of\r\nbee-culture. If an Apiary is approached when the bees are out in great\r\nnumbers, thousands and tens of thousands will continue their busy\r\npursuits without at all interfering with those who do not molest them.\r\nFrequently, however, there will be a few cross bees which come buzzing\r\naround our ears, and seem determined to sting without the very slightest\r\nprovocation. From such lawless bees no person without a bee-dress is\r\nabsolutely safe. By repeated examinations I have ascertained that\r\n_disease_ is the cause of such unreasonable irritability. I am never\r\nafraid that a healthy bee will attack me unless unusually provoked; and\r\nam always sure as soon as I hear one singing about my ears that it is\r\nincurably diseased. If such a bee is dissected it will be found to\r\nexhibit the unmistakable evidence that a peculiar kind of dysentery has\r\nalready fastened upon its system. In the first stages of this complaint\r\nthe insect is very irritable, refuses to labor, and seems unable or\r\nunwilling to distinguish friend from foe. As the disease progresses, it\r\nbecomes stupid, its body swells up, and is filled with a great mass of\r\nyellow matter, and being unable to fly, it crawls on the ground, in\r\nfront of the hive, and speedily perishes. I have never been able to\r\nascertain the cause of this singular malady, nor can I suggest any\r\nremedy for it. I hope that some scientific Apiarians will investigate it\r\nclosely, for if it could only be remedied, we might have hundreds of\r\ncolonies on our premises and in our gardens, and yet be perfectly safe.\r\n\r\nA person thoroughly acquainted with the leading principles of\r\nbee-culture as they are set forth in this Manual, will _never under any\r\ncircumstances_ find it necessary to provoke to fury a colony of bees.\r\nLet it be remembered that nothing can be more terribly vindictive than\r\na family of bees when thoroughly aroused by gross abuse or unskillful\r\ntreatment. Let their hive be suddenly overthrown or violently jarred, or\r\nlet them be provoked by the presence of a sweaty horse, or any animal\r\noffensive to them, so that the anger at first manifested by a few, is\r\nextended to the whole community, and the most severe and sometimes\r\ndangerous consequences may ensue. In the same way in the management of\r\nthe animals most useful to man, by ignorance or abuse, they may be\r\nroused to a state of frantic desperation, and limbs may be broken, and\r\noften lives destroyed; and yet no one possessed of common sense,\r\nattributes such calamities, except in very rare instances, to any thing\r\nelse than carelessness or want of skill. Let it be remembered that even\r\nthe most peaceable stock of bees can, in a very few days, by abusive\r\ntreatment be taught to look on every living thing as an enemy, and to\r\nsally forth with the most spiteful intentions, as soon as any one\r\napproaches their domicile. How often does it happen that the vicious\r\nbeast, which its owner so passionately belabors, is far less to blame\r\nfor its obstinacy, than the equally vicious brute who so unmercifully\r\nbeats it!\r\n\r\nA word now to those timid females who are almost ready to faint, or to\r\ngo into hysterics if a bee enters the house, or approaches them in the\r\ngarden or fields. Such alarm is entirely uncalled for. It is only in the\r\nvicinity of their homes, and in resistance to what they consider an evil\r\ndesign upon their very altars and firesides that these insects ever\r\nvolunteer an attack. Away from home, they are as peaceably inclined as\r\nyou could desire. If you attack them, they are much more eager to escape\r\nthan to offer you any annoyance, and they can be induced to sting, only\r\nwhen they are compressed, either by accident or design.\r\n\r\nLet not any of my readers think that they have even a slight\r\nencouragement, from this conduct of the bee, to reserve all their sweet\r\nsmiles and honied words for the world abroad, while they give free vent,\r\nin the sacred precincts of home, to ill-natured looks and ill-tempered\r\nlanguage; for towards the occupants of its honied dome, the bee is all\r\nkindness and affection. In the experience of many years I never saw an\r\ninstance in which two bees, members of the same family, ever seemed to\r\nbe actuated by any but the very kindest feelings toward each other. In\r\ntheir busy haste they often jostle against each other, but where every\r\nthing is well meant, every thing is well received: tens of thousands all\r\nlive together in the sweetest harmony and peace, when very often if\r\nthere are only two or three children in a family, the whole household is\r\ntormented by their constant bickerings and contention. Among the bees\r\nthe good mother is the honored queen of her happy family; they all wait\r\nupon her steps with unbounded reverence and affection, make way for her\r\nas she moves over the combs, smooth and brush her beautiful plumes,\r\noffer her food from time to time, and in short do all that they possibly\r\ncan to make her perfectly happy; while too often children treat their\r\nmothers with irreverence or neglect, and instead of striving with loving\r\nzeal to lighten their labors and save their steps, they treat them more\r\nas though they were servants hired only to wait upon every whim and to\r\nhumor every caprice.\r\n\r\nLet us pause for a moment, and contemplate further the admirable\r\narrangement by which the instinct of the bee which disposes it to defend\r\nits treasures, is made so perfectly compatible with the safety both of\r\nman and the domestic animals under his care. Suppose that away from\r\nhome, bees were as easily provoked, as they are in the immediate\r\nvicinity of their hives, what would become of our domestic animals among\r\nthe clover fields in the pastures? A tithe of the merry gambols they now\r\nso safely indulge in, would speedily bring about them a swarm of these\r\ninfuriated insects. In all our rambles among the green fields, we should\r\nconstantly be in peril; and no jocund mower would ever whet his\r\nglittering scythe, or swing his peaceful weapon, unless first clad in a\r\ndress impervious to their stings. In short, the bee, instead of being\r\nthe friend of man, would be one of his most vexatious enemies, and as\r\nhas been the case with the wolves and the bears, every effort would be\r\nmade for their utter extermination.\r\n\r\nThe sting of a bee often produces very painful, and upon some persons,\r\nvery dangerous effects. I am persuaded, from the result of my own\r\nobservation, that the bee seldom stings those whose systems are not\r\nsensitive to its venom, while it seems to take a special and malicious\r\npleasure in attacking those upon whom it produces the most painful\r\neffects! It may be that something in the secretions of such persons both\r\nprovokes the attack, and causes its consequences to be more severe.\r\n\r\nI should not advise persons upon whose system the sting of a bee\r\nproduces the most agonizing pain, and violent, if not dangerous\r\nsymptoms, to devote any attention to the practical part of an Apiary;\r\nalthough I am acquainted with a lady who is thus severely affected, and\r\nwho yet, strange to say, is a great enthusiast in Apiarian pursuits! I\r\nhave met with individuals, upon whom a sting produced the singular\r\neffect of causing their breath to smell like the venom of the enraged\r\ninsect! The smell of the poison resembles almost perfectly that of a\r\nripe banana. It produces a very irritating effect upon the bees\r\nthemselves; for if a minute drop of it is extended to them, on a stick,\r\nthey at once manifest the most decided anger.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the bee is a lover of sweet odors, and that\r\nunpleasant ones are very apt to excite its anger. And here I may as well\r\nspeak plainly, and say that bees have a special dislike to persons whose\r\nhabits are not cleanly, and particularly to those who bear about them, a\r\nperfume not in the very least resembling those\r\n\r\n                              \"Sabean odors\r\n    From the spicy shores of Araby the blest,\"\r\n\r\nof which the poet so beautifully discourses. Those who belong to the\r\nfamily of the \"great unwashed,\" will find to their cost that bees are\r\ndecided foes to all of their tribe. The peculiar odor of some persons,\r\nhowever cleanly, may account for the fact that the bees have such a\r\ndecided antipathy to their presence, in the vicinity of their hives. It\r\nis related of an enthusiastic Apiarian, that after a long and severe\r\nattack of fever, he was never able to take any more pleasure in his\r\nbees; his secretions seem to have undergone some change, so that the\r\nbees assailed him as soon as he ventured to approach their hives.\r\n\r\nNothing is more offensive to bees than the impure breath exhaled from\r\nhuman lungs; it excites them at once to fury. Would that in their hatred\r\nfor impure air, human beings had only a tithe of the sagacity exercised\r\nby bees! It would not be long before the thought of breathing air loaded\r\nwith all manner of impurities from human lungs, to say nothing of its\r\nloss of oxygen, would excite unutterable loathing and disgust.\r\n\r\nAs the smell of a sweaty horse is very offensive to the bees, it is\r\nnever safe to allow these animals to go near a hive, as they are\r\nsometimes attacked and killed by the furious insects. Those engaged in\r\nbee-culture on a large scale, will do well to enclose their Apiaries\r\nwith a strong fence, so as to prevent cattle from molesting the hives.\r\nIf the Apiary is enclosed by a high fence, with sharp and strong\r\npickets, and the door is furnished with a strong lock, it will prevent\r\nthe losses which in some localities are so common from human pilferers.\r\nSuch losses may be guarded against, by fastening a wrought iron ring\r\ninto the top of each hive, well clinched on the inside; an iron rod may\r\nrun through these rings, and thus with two padlocks and fixtures, (one\r\nat each end,) a dozen or more hives may be secured. I am happy to say\r\nthat in most localities such precautions are entirely unnecessary. A\r\nplace in which the stealing of honey and fruit is practiced by any\r\nexcept those who are candidates for State's Prison, is in a fair way of\r\nbeing soon considered as a very undesirable place of residence. If\r\nowners of Apiaries, gardens and orchards, could be induced to pursue a\r\nmore liberal policy, and not be so meanly penurious as they often are, I\r\nam persuaded that they would find it conduce very highly to their\r\ninterests. The honey and fruit expended with a cheerful, hearty\r\nliberality, would be more than repaid to them in the good will secured,\r\nand in the end would cost much less than bars and bolts. Reader! do not\r\nimagine that I have the least idea that a thoroughly selfish man, can\r\never be made to practice this or any other doctrine of benevolence.\r\nDemonstrate it again and again, until even to his narrow and contracted\r\nview it seems almost as clear as light, still he will never find the\r\nheart to reduce it to practice. You might almost as well expect to\r\ntransform an incarnate fiend into an angel of light, by demonstrating\r\nthat \"Wisdom's ways are ways of pleasantness,\" while \"the path of the\r\ntransgressor is hard,\" as to attempt to stamp upon a heart encrusted\r\nwith the adamant of selfishness, the noble impress of a liberal spirit.\r\n\r\nOf all the senses, that of smell in the bee, seems to be the most\r\nperfect. Huber has demonstrated its exceeding acuteness, by numerous\r\ninteresting experiments. If honey is placed in vessels from which the\r\nodor can escape, but in which it cannot be seen, the bees will soon\r\nalight upon them and eagerly attempt to find an entrance. It is by this\r\nsense, unquestionably, that they recognize the members of their own\r\ncommunity, although it seems to us very singular that each colony should\r\nhave its own peculiar scent. Not only can two colonies be safely united\r\nby giving them the same odor, but in the same way any number of colonies\r\nmay be made to live in perfect peace. If hundreds of hives are all\r\nconnected by gauze wire ventilators, so that the air passes freely from\r\none to another, the bees will all live in absolute harmony, and if any\r\nbee attempts to enter the wrong hive, he will not be molested. The same\r\nresult can often be attained by feeding colonies from a common vessel. I\r\nhave seen literally hundreds of thousands of bees that after being\r\ntreated in this way so as to acquire the same odor, were always gentle\r\ntowards each other, while if a single bee from a strange Apiary, lit\r\nupon the feeder, it was sure to be killed.\r\n\r\nI have described, (p. 213,) the use which I make of peppermint, in order\r\nto prevent bees from quarreling when they are united. The Rev. Mr.\r\nKleine, (see p. 359,) in a recent number of the Bienenzeitung, has\r\nrecommended the use of another article, which he finds to be very useful\r\nin preventing robbing. His statement would have come in more\r\nappropriately in the Chapter on Robbing, but was not received until too\r\nlate. He says that the most convenient and effectual mode of arresting\r\nand repelling the attacks of robbers, is, to impart to the attacked hive\r\nsome intensely powerful and unaccustomed odor. He effects this most\r\nreadily, by placing a small portion of _musk_ in the attacked hive, late\r\nin the evening, when all the robbers have retreated. On the following\r\nmorning, the bees, (provided they have a healthy queen,) will promptly\r\nand boldly meet their assailants, and these in turn are non-plussed by\r\nthe unwonted odor, and if any of them enter the hive and carry off some\r\nof the coveted booty, they will not be recognized nor received at home\r\non their return, on account of their strange smell, but will be at once\r\nseized as strangers, and killed by their own household. Thus the robbing\r\nis speedily brought to a close.\r\n\r\nIn combination with my blocks, this device might be made very effectual.\r\nWhen the Apiarian perceives that a hive is being robbed, let him shut up\r\nthe entrance: before dusk he can open it and allow the robbers to go\r\nhome, and then: put in a small piece of musk: the entrance next day may\r\nbe kept so contracted that only a single bee can enter at once. In the\r\nunion of stocks the same substance might be used advantageously. A short\r\ntime before the process is attempted, each colony might have a small\r\ndose of musk (a piece of musk tied up in a little bag,) and they would\r\nthen be sure to agree. I prefer, however, in most cases, the use of\r\nscented sugar-water.\r\n\r\nBy using my double hives, and putting a small piece of gauze-wire on an\r\nopening made in the partition, the two colonies having the same scent\r\nwill always agree; this will be very convenient where they are compelled\r\nto live as such near neighbors, and enables the Apiarian at any time to\r\nunite them and appropriate their surplus stores. These double hives are\r\nadmirably adapted to the wants of those who wish to make the smallest\r\npossible departure from the old system, as they need make no change,\r\nexcept to unite the stocks instead of killing the bees.\r\n\r\nI have already remarked that no operation should ever be attempted upon\r\nbees, by which a whole colony is liable to be excited to an ungovernable\r\npitch of fury. Such operations are _never_ necessary; and a skillful\r\nApiarian will, by availing himself of the principles laid down in this\r\nTreatise, both easily and safely do everything that is at all desirable,\r\neven to the driving of a powerful colony from an old box hive. When bees\r\nare improperly dealt with, they will \"compass\" their assailant \"about,\"\r\nwith the most savage ferocity, and woe be to him if they can creep up\r\nhis clothes, or find on his person a single unprotected spot! On the\r\ncontrary, when not provoked by foolish management or wanton abuse, the\r\nfew who are bent on mischief, appear to retain still some touch of\r\ngrace, amid all their desperation. Like the thorough bred scold, who by\r\nthe elevated pitch of her voice, often gives timely warning to those who\r\nwould escape from the sharp sword of her tongue, a bee bent upon\r\nmischief raises its note almost an octave above the peaceable pitch, and\r\nusually gives us timely warning, that it means to sting, if it can. Even\r\nthen, it will seldom proceed to extremities, unless it can leave its\r\nsting somewhere upon the face of its victim, and usually as near as\r\npossible to the eye; for bees and all other members of the stinging\r\ntribe, seem to have, as it were, an intuitive perception that this is\r\nthe most vulnerable spot upon the \"human face divine.\" If the head is\r\nquietly lowered, and the face covered with the hands, they will often\r\nfollow a person for some rods, all the time sounding their war note in\r\nhis ears, taunting him for his sneaking conduct, and daring him, just\r\nfor one single moment, to look up and allow them to catch but a glimpse\r\nof his coward face!\r\n\r\nIf a person is suddenly attacked by angry bees, no matter how numerous\r\nor vindictive they may be, not the slightest attempt should ever be made\r\nto act on the offensive. If a single bee is violently struck at, a dozen\r\nwill soon be on hand to avenge the insult, and if the resistance is\r\nstill continued, hundreds and at last thousands will join in the\r\nattack. The assailed party should quickly retreat from the vicinity of\r\nthe hives, to the protection of a building, or if none is near, he\r\nshould hide himself in a clump of bushes, and lie perfectly still, with\r\nhis head covered, until the bees leave him.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEDIES FOR THE STING OF A BEE.\r\n\r\nIf only a few of the host of remedies, so zealously advocated, could be\r\nmade effectual, few persons would have much reason to dread being stung.\r\nMost of them, however, are of no manner of use whatever. Like the\r\nprescriptions of the quack, they are absolutely worse than doing nothing\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to be done after being stung, is to pull the sting out\r\nof the wound _as quickly as possible_. Even after it is torn from the\r\nbody of the bee, (see p. 60,) the muscles which control it, are in\r\nactive operation, and it penetrates deeper and deeper into the flesh,\r\ninjecting continually more and more of its poison into the wound. Every\r\nApiarian should have about his person, or close at hand, a small piece\r\nof looking-glass, so that he may be able with the least possible delay\r\nto find and remove a sting. In most cases if it is at once removed, it\r\nwill produce no serious consequences; whereas if suffered to empty all\r\nits vials of wrath, it may cause great inflammation and severe\r\nsuffering. After the sting is removed, the utmost possible care should\r\nbe taken, not to irritate the wound by the very _slightest rubbing_.\r\nHowever intense the smarting, and of course the disposition to apply\r\nfriction to the wound, it should never be done, as the poison will at\r\nonce be carried through the circulating system, and severe consequences\r\nmay ensue. As most of the popular remedies are rubbed in, they are of\r\ncourse worse than nothing. Be careful not to _suck_ the wound as so many\r\npersons do; this produces irritation in the same way with rubbing. Who\r\ndoes not know that a musquito bite, even after the lapse of several\r\ndays, may be brought to life again, by violent rubbing or sucking? The\r\nmoment that the blood is put into a violent and unnatural circulation,\r\nthe poison is quickly diffused over a considerable part of the system.\r\nIf the mouth is applied to the wound, other unpleasant consequences may\r\nensue. While the poison of most snakes and many other noxious animals\r\naffects only the circulating system, and may therefore be swallowed with\r\nimpunity, the poison of the bee acts powerfully, not only upon the\r\ncirculating system, but upon the organs of digestion. The most\r\ndistressing head-aches are often produced by it.\r\n\r\nFrom my own experience, I recommend _cold water_ as the very best remedy\r\nwith which I am acquainted, for the sting of a bee. It is often applied\r\nin the shape of a plaster of mud, but may be better used by wetting\r\ncloths and holding them gently to the wound. Cold water seems to act in\r\ntwo ways. The poison of the bee being very volatile, is quickly\r\ndissolved in water; and the coldness of the water has also a powerful\r\ntendency to check inflammation and to prevent the virus from being taken\r\nup by the absorbents and carried through the system. The leaves of the\r\nplantain, crushed and applied to the wound, will answer as a very good\r\nsubstitute when water cannot at once be procured. The broad-leafed\r\nplantain, or as some call it, \"the toad plantain,\" is regarded by many\r\nas possessing a very great efficacy. Bevan recommends the use of spirits\r\nof hartshorn, applied to the wound, and says that in cases of severe\r\nstinging its internal use is beneficial. Whatever remedy is applied,\r\nshould be used if possible, without a moment's delay. The immediate\r\nextraction of the sting, will be found, even if nothing more is done,\r\nmuch more efficacious than any remedy that can be applied, after it has\r\nbeen allowed to remain and discharge all its venom into the wound.\r\n\r\nIt may be some comfort to those who are anxious to cultivate bees, to\r\nknow that after a while the poison will produce less and less effect\r\nupon their system. When I first became interested in bees, a sting was\r\nquite a formidable thing, the pain often being very intense, and the\r\nwound swelling so as sometimes to obstruct my sight. At present, the\r\npain is usually slight, and if I can only succeed in quickly extracting\r\nthe sting, no unpleasant consequences ensue, even if no remedies are\r\nused. Huish speaks of seeing the bald head of Bonner, a celebrated\r\npractical Apiarian, lined with bee stings which seemed to produce upon\r\nhim no unpleasant effects. Like Mithridates, king of Pontus, he seemed\r\nalmost to thrive upon poison itself!\r\n\r\nI have met with a highly amusing remedy very gravely propounded by an\r\nold English Apiarian. I mention it more as a matter of curiosity, than\r\nbecause I imagine that any of my readers will be likely to make trial of\r\nit. He says, let the person who has been stung, catch as speedily as\r\npossible, another bee, and make it sting on the same spot! It requires\r\nsome courage even in an enthusiastic disciple of Huber, to venture upon\r\nsuch a singular homeopathic remedy; but as this old writer had\r\npreviously stated that the oftener a person was stung, the less he\r\nsuffered from the venom, and as I had proved, in my own experience, the\r\ntruth of this assertion, I determined to make trial of his remedy. I\r\nallowed a bee to sting me upon the finger and suffered the sting to\r\nremain until it had discharged all its venom. I then compelled another\r\nbee to insert its sting as near as possible in the same spot. I used no\r\nremedies of any kind, and had the satisfaction, in my zeal for new\r\ndiscoveries, of suffering more from the pain and swelling, than I had\r\npreviously experienced for years.\r\n\r\nAn old writer recommends a powder of dried bees, for distressing cases\r\nof stoppages; and some of the highest medical authorities have recently\r\nrecommended a tea made by pouring boiling water upon bees, for the same\r\ncomplaint, while the homeopathic physicians employ the poison of the\r\nbee, which they call _apis_, for a great variety of maladies. That it is\r\ncapable of producing intense head-aches any one who has been stung, or\r\nwho has tasted the poison, very well knows.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEE-DRESS.\r\n\r\nTimid Apiarians, and all who are liable to suffer severely from the\r\nsting of a bee, should by all means furnish themselves with the\r\nprotection of a bee-dress. The great objection to gauze-wire veils or\r\nother materials of which such a dress has been usually made, is that\r\nthey obstruct clear vision, so highly important in all operations,\r\nbesides producing such excessive heat and perspiration, as to make the\r\nApiarian peculiarly offensive to the bees. I prefer to use what I shall\r\ncall a _bee-hat_, of entirely novel construction. It is made of wire\r\ncloth, the meshes of which are too fine to admit a bee, and yet coarse\r\nenough to allow a free circulation of air, and to permit distinct sight.\r\nThe wire cloth should first be fastened together in a circular shape,\r\nlike a hat, and large enough to go very easily over the head; its top\r\nmay be of cotton cloth, and it should have the same material fastened\r\naround its lower edge, and furnished with strings to draw it so closely\r\naround the neck and shoulders that a bee cannot creep under it. Woolen\r\nstockings may then be drawn over the hands, or better still, India\r\nRubber gloves, such as are now in very common use, may be worn; these\r\ngloves are impenetrable to the sting of a bee, and yet are so soft and\r\npliant as scarcely in the least to interfere with the operations of the\r\nApiarian.\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the diseased bees of which I have several times\r\nspoken, such precautions would be entirely unnecessary. The best\r\nApiarians as it is, dispense with them, even at the cost of a sting now\r\nand then.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTINCTS OF BEES.\r\n\r\nThis treatise has already grown to such a length, that I must be\r\nexceedingly brief on a point peculiarly interesting to all who delight\r\nin investigating the wonders of the insect world. In the preceding parts\r\nof the work, numerous proofs have been given of the refined instincts of\r\nthe bee. It is impossible always to draw the line between instinct and\r\nreason, and very often some of the actions of animals and insects appear\r\nto be the result of a process of reasoning apparently almost the same\r\nwith the exercise of the reasoning faculty in man. \"There is this\r\ndifference\" says Mr. Spence, \"between intellect in man, and the rest of\r\nthe animal creation. Their intellect teaches them to follow the lead of\r\ntheir senses, and to make such use of the external world as their\r\nappetites or instincts incline them to,--and _this is their wisdom_:\r\nwhile the intellect of man, being associated with an immortal principle,\r\nand connected with a world above that which his senses reveal to him,\r\ncan, by aid derived from Heaven, control those senses, and render them\r\nobedient to the governing power of his nature; and _this is his\r\nwisdom_.\"\r\n\r\nThis subject has seldom been more happily expressed than by Mr. Spence.\r\nThe line of distinction between man and the lower orders of creation, is\r\nnot the mere fact that he reasons and they do not, but that he has a\r\nmoral and accountable nature, while they have nothing of the kind.\r\n\r\n\"It will be evident,\" says Bevan, \"that though I make a distinction\r\nbetween the instinct and the reason of bees, I do not confound their\r\nreason with the reason of man. But to obviate all possibility of\r\nmisconception, I will at once define my meaning, when I use the terms\r\ninsect reason and instinct.\"\r\n\r\n\"By _reason_, I mean the power of making deductions from previous\r\nexperience or observation, and thereby of adapting means to ends.\r\n_Instinct_ I regard as a disposition and power to perform certain\r\nactions in the same uniform manner, depending upon nice mechanism and\r\nhaving no reference either to observation or experience; operating on\r\nthe means, without anticipation of the end, incited by no hope,\r\ncontrolled by no foreboding. Those who have attended to this subject,\r\nwill be aware that _insect reason_, as above defined, is more restricted\r\nin its functions than _the reason of man_; to which is superadded the\r\npower of distinguishing between the true and the false, and, according\r\nto some metaphysicians, between right and wrong. Reason, in man, has a\r\nregular growth and a slow progression; all the arts he practices evince\r\nskill and dexterity, proportioned to the pains which have been taken in\r\nacquiring them. In the lower links of creation, but little of this\r\ngradual improvement is observable; their powers carry them almost\r\ndirectly to their object. They are perfect, as Bacon says, in all their\r\nmembers and organs from the very beginning.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Far different Man, to higher fates assign'd,\r\n    Unfolds with tardier step his Proteus mind,\r\n    With numerous Instincts fraught, that lose their force\r\n    Like shallow streams, divided in their course;\r\n    Long weak, and helpless, on the fostering breast,\r\n    In fond dependence leans the infant guest,\r\n    Till reason ripens what young impulse taught,\r\n    And builds, on sense, the lofty pile of thought;\r\n    From earth, sea, air, the quick perceptions rise,\r\n    And swell the mental fabric to the skies.\"\r\n                                             _Evans._\r\n\r\nI shall here narrate a very remarkable instance of sagacity which seems\r\nto approach as near to human reason, as any thing in the bee which has\r\never fallen under my notice. In the year 1851, I had a small model hive\r\nconstructed, into which I temporarily placed a swarm of bees. The\r\nparticular object which I had in view, was to test the feasibility of\r\nsome plans which I had recently devised, for facilitating the storing of\r\nhoney in small tumblers. The bees, in a short time, filled the hive and\r\nstored about a dozen glasses with honey. I was called away from them,\r\nfor a few days, and was much surprised, on my return, to find that the\r\nhoney which had been stored up in the hive and sealed over for Winter\r\nuse, was all gone, and the cells filled with eggs and young worms! The\r\nhive stood in a covered bee house, and the bees had built a large\r\nquantity of comb on the _outside_ of the hive, into which they had\r\ntransferred the honey taken from the interior. The object of this\r\nunusual procedure was, beyond all question, to give the poor queen a\r\nplace within the hive for laying her eggs: for this purpose they\r\nuncapped and emptied all the cells so carefully sealed over, instead of\r\nusing the new comb on the outside for the brood.\r\n\r\nThose who wish to study the Natural History of the honey-bee, to the\r\nbest advantage, will derive great aid in their investigations, from the\r\nuse of my _Observing Hives_. Each comb in these hives is attached to a\r\nmovable frame, and they all admit of easy removal. In this respect the\r\nconstruction of the hive is entirely new, and while it greatly\r\nfacilitates the business of observation, it enables the Apiarian, on\r\nthe approach of cool weather, to transfer his bees from a hive in which\r\nthey cannot winter, to one of the common construction. As soon as the\r\nweather in the Spring is sufficiently warm, they may again be placed in\r\nthe observing hive, in which, (as both sides of every comb admit of\r\ninspection,) every bee can be seen, and all the wonders of the hive are\r\nexposed to the full light of day; (see p. 24.) In the common observing\r\nhives experiments are often conducted with great difficulty, by cutting\r\naway parts of the comb, whereas in mine, they can all be performed by\r\nthe simple removal of one of the frames, and if the colony becomes\r\nreduced in numbers, it may, in a few moments, be strengthened by helping\r\nit to maturing brood from one of the other hives. A very intelligent\r\nwriter in a description of the different hives exhibited at the World's\r\nFair, in London, lamented that no method had yet been devised of\r\nenabling bees to cluster, in cool weather, in an observing hive, and\r\nthat it was found next to impossible to preserve them in such hives over\r\nWinter. By the use of the movable frames, this difficulty is entirely\r\nobviated.\r\n\r\nI cannot allow this work to come to a close, without acknowledging my\r\ngreat obligations to Mr. Samuel Wagner, of York, Pennsylvania. To him I\r\nam indebted for a knowledge of Dzierzon's discoveries, and for many\r\nvaluable suggestions scattered throughout the Treatise.",
