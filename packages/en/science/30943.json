II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NOVELTY WORKS, WITH SOME DESCRIPTION OF THE MACHINERY AND THE\r\nPROCESSES EMPLOYED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF MARINE STEAM-ENGINES OF THE\r\nLARGEST CLASS.\r\n\r\nBY JACOB ABBOTT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF THE NOVELTY IRON WORKS, NEW YORK, (_As\r\nseen from the East River._)]\r\n\r\nPerhaps no one of those vast movements which are now going forward among\r\nmankind, and which mark so strikingly the industrial power and genius of\r\nthe present age, is watched with more earnest interest by thinking men,\r\nthan the successive steps of the progress by which the mechanical power\r\nof steam and machinery is gradually advancing, in its contest for the\r\ndominion of the seas. There is a double interest in this conflict. In\r\nfact, the conflict itself is a double one. There is first a struggle\r\nbetween the mechanical power and ingenuity of man, on the one hand, and\r\nthe uncontrollable and remorseless violence of ocean storms on the\r\nother; and, secondly, there is the rivalry, not unfriendly, though\r\nextremely ardent and keen, between the two most powerful commercial\r\nnations on the globe, each eager to be the first to conquer the common\r\nfoe.\r\n\r\nThe armories in which the ordnance and ammunition for this warfare are\r\nprepared, consist, so far as this country is concerned, of certain\r\nestablishments, vast in their extent and capacity, though unpretending\r\nin external appearance, which are situated in the upper part of the city\r\nof New York, on the shores of the East River. As the city of New York is\r\nsustained almost entirely by its commerce, and as this commerce is\r\nbecoming every year more and more dependent for its prosperity and\r\nprogress upon the power of the enormous engines by which its most\r\nimportant functions are now performed, the establishments where these\r\nengines are invented and made, and fitted into the ships which they are\r\ndestined to propel, constitute really the heart of the metropolis;\r\nthough, the visitor, who comes down for the first time by the East\r\nRiver, from the Sound, in the morning boat from Norwich or Fall River,\r\nis very prone to pass them carelessly by--his thoughts intent upon what\r\nhe considers the superior glory and brilliancy which emanate from the\r\nhotels and theatres of Broadway.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there is very little to attract the eye of the unthinking\r\ntraveler to these establishments as he glides swiftly by them in the\r\nearly morning. He is astonished perhaps at the multitude of steamers\r\nwhich he sees lining the shores in this part of the city, some drawn up\r\ninto the docks for repairs; others new, and moored alongside a pier to\r\nreceive their machinery; and others still upon the stocks in the\r\ncapacious ship-yards, in the various stages of that skeleton condition\r\nwhich in the ship marks the commencement, as in animal life it does the\r\nend, of existence. Beyond and above the masts and spars and smoke-pipes\r\nof this mass of shipping, the observer sees here and there a columnar\r\nchimney, or the arms of a monstrous derrick or crane, or a steam-pipe\r\nejecting vapor in successive puffs with the regularity of an animal\r\npulsation. He little thinks that these are the beatings which mark the\r\nspot where the true heart of the great metropolis really lies. But it is\r\nactually so. The splendor and the fashion of the Fifth Avenue, and of\r\nUnion-square, as well as the brilliancy, and the ceaseless movement and\r\ndin of Broadway, are the mere incidents and ornaments of the structure,\r\nwhile these establishments, and others of kindred character and\r\nfunction, form the foundation on which the whole of the vast edifice\r\nreposes.\r\n\r\nWe select, rather by accident than otherwise, the Novelty Works as a\r\nspecimen of the establishments to which we have been alluding, for\r\ndescription in this Number. A general view of the works as they appear\r\nfrom the river, is presented in the engraving at the head of this\r\narticle, with the docks and piers belonging to the establishment in the\r\nfore-ground.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the inclosure is by a great gateway, through which the\r\nvisitor on approaching it, will, very probably see an enormous truck or\r\ncar issuing, drawn by a long team of horses, and bearing some ponderous\r\npiece of machinery suspended beneath it by means of levers and chains.\r\nOn the right of the entrance gate is the porter's lodge, with entrances\r\nfrom it to the offices, as represented in the plan on the adjoining page\r\nBeyond the entrance, and just within the inclosure may be seen a great\r\ncrane used for receiving or delivering the vast masses of metal, the\r\nshafts, the cylinders, the boilers, the vacuum pans, and other ponderous\r\nformations which are continually coming and going to and from the yard.\r\nBeyond the crane is seen the bell by which the hours of work are\r\nregulated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO THE NOVELTY WORKS.]\r\n\r\nThe plan upon the adjoining page will give the reader some idea of the\r\nextent of the accommodations required for the manufacture of such heavy\r\nand massive machinery. On the right of the entrance may be seen the\r\nporter's lodge, shown in perspective in the view below. Beyond it, in\r\nthe yard, stands the crane, which is seen likewise in the view. Turning\r\nto the left, just beyond the crane, the visitor enters the iron foundry,\r\na spacious inclosure, with ovens and furnaces along the sides, and\r\nenormous cranes swinging in various directions in the centre. These\r\ncranes are for hoisting the heavy castings out of the pits in which they\r\nare formed. The parts marked v v v, are ovens for drying the moulds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTurning to the right from the foundry, and passing down through the\r\nyard, the visitor finds himself in the midst of a complicated maze of\r\nbuildings, which extend in long ranges toward the water, with lanes and\r\npassages between them like the streets of a town. In these passages\r\ncompanies of workmen are seen, some going to and fro, drawing heavy\r\nmasses of machinery upon iron trucks; others employed in hoisting some\r\nponderous cylinder or shaft by a crane, or stacking pigs of iron in\r\ngreat heaps, to be ready for the furnaces which are roaring near as if\r\neager to devour them. And all the time there issues from the open doors\r\nof the great boiler-shops and forging-shops below, an incessant clangor,\r\nproduced by the blows of the sledges upon the rivets of the boilers, or\r\nof the trip-hammers at the forges.\r\n\r\nThe relative positions of the various shops where the different\r\noperations are performed will be seen by examination of the plan. The\r\nmotive power by which all the machinery of the establishment is driven,\r\nis furnished by a stationary engine in the very centre of the works,\r\nrepresented in the plan. It stands between two of the principal shops.\r\nOn the right is seen the boiler, and on the left the engine--while the\r\nblack square below, just within the great boiler-shop, represents the\r\nchimney. Other similar squares in different parts of the plan represent\r\nchimneys also, in the different parts of the establishment. These\r\nchimneys may be seen in perspective in the general view, at the head of\r\nthis article, and may be identified with their several representations\r\nin the plan, by a careful comparison. The one belonging to the engine is\r\nthe central one in the picture as well as in the plan--that is, the one\r\nfrom which the heaviest volume of smoke is issuing.\r\n\r\nThis central engine, since it carries all the machinery of the works, by\r\nmeans of which every thing is formed and fashioned, is the life and soul\r\nof the establishment--the _mother_, in fact, of all the monsters which\r\nissue from it; and it is impossible to look upon her, as she toils on\r\nindustriously in her daily duty, and think of her Titanic progeny,\r\nscattered now over every ocean on the globe, without a certain feeling\r\nof respect and even of admiration.\r\n\r\nA careful inspection of the plan will give the reader some ideas of the\r\nnature of the functions performed in these establishments, and of the\r\ngeneral arrangements adopted in them. The magnitude and extent of them\r\nis shown by this fact, that the number of men employed at the Novelty\r\nWorks is from one thousand to twelve hundred. These are all _men_, in\r\nthe full vigor of life. If now we add to this number a proper estimate\r\nfor the families of these men, and for the mechanics and artisans who\r\nsupply their daily wants, all of whom reside in the streets surrounding\r\nthe works, we shall find that the establishment represents, at a\r\nmoderate calculation, a population of _ten thousand souls_.\r\n\r\nThe proper regulation of the labors of so large a body of workmen as are\r\nemployed in such an establishment, requires, of course, much system in\r\nthe general arrangements, and very constant and careful supervision on\r\nthe part of those intrusted with the charge of the various divisions of\r\nthe work. The establishment forms, in fact, a regularly organized\r\ncommunity, having, like any state or kingdom, its gradations of rank,\r\nits established usages, its written laws, its police, its finance, its\r\nrecords, its rewards, and its penalties. The operation of the principles\r\nof system, and of the requirements of law, leads, in such a community as\r\nthis, to many very curious and striking results, some of which it would\r\nbe interesting to describe, if we had space for such descriptions. But\r\nwe must pass to the more immediate subject in this article, which is the\r\nstructure of the engine itself, and not that of the community which\r\nproduces it.\r\n\r\nThe engraving on the next page represents the interior of the\r\nengine-room of the Humboldt--a new steamer, which was lying at the dock\r\nat the time of our visit, receiving her machinery; though probably\r\nbefore these pages shall come under the eye of the reader, she will be\r\nsteadily forcing her way over the foaming surges of the broad Atlantic.\r\nThe machinery, as we saw it, was incomplete, and the parts in\r\ndisorder--the various masses of which it was ultimately to be composed,\r\nresting on temporary supports, in different stages, apparently of their\r\nslow journey to the place and the connection in which they respectively\r\nbelonged. The ingenious artist, however, who made the drawings,\r\nsucceeded in doing, by means of his imagination, at once, what it will\r\nrequire the workmen several weeks to perform, with all their complicated\r\nmachinery of derricks, tackles, and cranes. He put every thing in its\r\nplace, and has given us a view of the whole structure as it will appear\r\nwhen the ship is ready for sea.\r\n\r\nThere are _two_ engines and _four_ boilers; thus the machinery is all\r\ndouble, so that if any fatal accident or damage should accrue to any\r\npart, only one half of the moving force on which the ship relies would\r\nbe suspended. The heads of two of the boilers are to be seen on the left\r\nof the view. They are called the _starboard_ and _larboard_\r\nboilers--those words meaning _right_ and _left_. That is, the one on the\r\nright to a person standing before them in the engine room, and facing\r\nthem, is the starboard, and the other the larboard boiler. It is the\r\nlarboard boiler which is nearest the spectator in the engraving.\r\n\r\nThe boilers, the heads of which only are seen in the engraving, are\r\nenormous in magnitude and capacity, extending as they do far forward\r\ninto the hold of the ship. In marine engines of the largest class they\r\nare sometimes thirty-six feet long and over twelve feet in diameter.\r\nThere is many a farmer's dwelling house among the mountains, which is\r\ndeemed by its inmates spacious and comfortable, that has less capacity.\r\nIn fact, placed upon end, one of these boilers would form a tower with a\r\nvery good sized room on each floor, and four stories high. The manner in\r\nwhich the boilers are made will be presently explained.\r\n\r\nThe steam generated in the boilers is conveyed to the engine, where it\r\nis to do its work, by what is called the steam pipe. The steam pipe of\r\nthe larboard engine, that is, of the one nearest the spectator, is not\r\nrepresented in the engraving, as it would have intercepted too much the\r\nview of the other parts. That belonging to the starboard engine,\r\nhowever, may be seen passing across from the boiler to the engine, on\r\nthe back side of the room. The destination of the steam is the\r\n_cylinder_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF A MARINE ENGINE.]\r\n\r\nThe cylinder, marked C, is seen on the extreme right, in the view. It\r\nmay be known, too, by its form, which corresponds with its name. The\r\ncylinder is the heart and soul of the engine, being the seat and centre\r\nof its power. The steam is generated in the boilers, but while it\r\nremains there it remains quiescent and inert. The action in which its\r\nmighty power is expended, and by means of which all subsequent effects\r\nare produced, is the lifting and bringing down of the enormous piston\r\nwhich plays within the cylinder. This piston is a massive metallic disc\r\nor plate, fitting the interior of the cylinder by its edges, and rising\r\nor falling by the expansive force of the steam, as it is admitted\r\nalternatively above and below it.\r\n\r\nThe round beam which is seen issuing from the centre of the head of the\r\ncylinder is called the piston rod. The piston itself is firmly secured\r\nto the lower end of this rod within the cylinder. Of course, when the\r\npiston is forced upward by the pressure of the steam admitted beneath\r\nit, the piston rod rises, too, with all the force of the expansion. This\r\nis, in the case of the largest marine engines, a force of about a\r\nhundred tons. That is to say, if in the place of the cross head--the\r\nbeam marked H in the engraving which surmounts the piston--there were a\r\nmass of rock weighing a hundred tons, which would be, in the case of\r\ngranite, a block four feet square and eighty feet high, the force of the\r\nsteam beneath the piston in the cylinder would be competent to lift it.\r\n\r\nThe piston rod, rising with this immense force carries up the cross\r\nhead, and with the cross head the two _side rods_, one of which is seen\r\nin full, in the engraving, and is marked S. There is a side rod on each\r\nside of the cylinders. The lower ends of these rods are firmly connected\r\nwith the back ends of what are called the _side levers_. One of these\r\nside levers is seen in full view in the engraving. It is the massive\r\nflat beam, marked L, near the fore-ground of the view. It turns upon an\r\nenormous pivot which passes through the centre of it, as seen in the\r\ndrawing, in such a manner that when the cylinder end is drawn up by the\r\nlifting of the cross head, the other end is borne down to the same\r\nextent, and with the same prodigious force. There is another side beam,\r\non the other side of the cylinder, which moves isochronously with the\r\none in view. The forward end of this other beam may be seen, though the\r\nmain body of it is concealed from view. These two forward ends of the\r\nlevers are connected by a heavy bar, called the _cross tail_, which\r\npasses across from one to the other. From the centre of this cross tail,\r\na bar called the connecting rod rises to the crank, where the force\r\nexerted by the steam in the cylinders is finally expended in turning the\r\ngreat paddle wheels by means of the main shaft, S, which is seen resting\r\nin the pillow block, P, above. These are the essential parts of the\r\nengine, and we now proceed to consider the mode of manufacturing these\r\nseveral parts, somewhat in detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CUTTING ENGINE.]\r\n\r\nThe boilers are formed of wrought iron. The material is previously\r\nrolled into plates of the requisite thickness, and then the first part\r\nof the process of forming these plates into a boiler is to cut them into\r\nproper forms. The monster that fulfills the function of shears for this\r\npurpose, bears a very slight resemblance to any ordinary cutting\r\nimplement It resembles, on the other hand, as represented in the\r\nadjoining engraving, an enormous letter U, standing perpendicularly upon\r\none of its edges. Through the centre of the upper branch of it there\r\npasses a shaft or axle, which is turned by the wheels and machinery\r\nbehind it, and which itself works the cutter at the outer end of it by\r\nmeans of an eccentric wheel. This cutter may be seen just protruding\r\nfrom its place, upon the plate which the workmen are holding underneath.\r\nThe iron plates thus presented are sometimes nearly half an inch thick,\r\nbut the monstrous jaw of the engine, though it glides up and down when\r\nthere is nothing beneath it in the most gentle and quiet manner\r\npossible, cuts them through, as if they were plates of wax, and\r\napparently without feeling the obstruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BENDING AND PUNCHING ENGINES.]\r\n\r\nThe plates, when cut, are to be bent to the proper curvature. The\r\nmachine by which this bending is effected is seen above, in the\r\nback-ground. It consists of three rollers, placed in such a position in\r\nrelation to each other, that the plate, in being forced through between\r\nthem, is bent to any required curvature. These rollers are made to\r\nrevolve by great wheels at the sides, with handles at the circumference\r\nof them, which handles act as levers, and are worked by men, as seen in\r\nthe engraving.\r\n\r\nThe separate plates of which a boiler is composed are fastened together\r\nby means of massive rivets, and it is necessary, accordingly, to punch\r\nrows of holes along the edges of the plates for the insertion of the\r\nrivets. This process may be seen on the _left_ in the above engraving.\r\nTwo men are holding the plate which is to be punched. The punch is\r\ndriven through the plate by means of the great lever, which forms the\r\nupper part of the engine. The upright part in front is driven forward by\r\nmeans of the cam in the large wheel behind, a part of which only is seen\r\nin the engraving. This cam raises the long arm of the lever by means of\r\nthe pulley in the end of it, and so drives the point of the punch\r\nthrough the plate. There is a support for the plate behind it, between\r\nthe plate and the man, with a small opening in it, into which the punch\r\nenters, driving before it the round button of iron which it has cut from\r\nthe plate.\r\n\r\nOn the right, in the above engraving, is a punching engine worked by\r\nmen, the other being driven by steam power. These machines are\r\nsufficient to make all the ordinary perforations required in\r\nboiler-plates. Larger holes, when required, have to be bored by a drill,\r\nas represented in the following engraving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BORING-ENGINE.]\r\n\r\nThe view below represents the interior of one of the great boiler rooms\r\nwhere the boilers are put together by riveting the plates to each other\r\nat their edges. Some men stand inside, holding heavy sledges against the\r\nheads of the rivets, while others on the outside, with other sledges,\r\nbeat down the part of the iron which protrudes, so as to form another\r\nhead to each rivet, on the outside. This process can be seen distinctly\r\nin the boiler nearest to the observer in the view below. The planks\r\nwhich are seen crossing each other in the open end, are temporary\r\nbraces, put in to preserve the cylindrical form of the mass, to prevent\r\nthe iron from bending itself by its own weight, before the iron heads\r\nare put in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RIVETING THE BOILERS.]\r\n\r\nSometimes operations must be performed upon the sides of the boiler\r\nrequiring the force of machinery. To effect this purpose, shafts carried\r\nby the central engine to which we have already alluded, are attached to\r\nthe walls in various parts of the room, as seen in the engraving.\r\nConnected with these shafts are various drilling and boring machines,\r\nwhich can at any time be set in motion, or put to rest, by being thrown\r\nin or out of gear. One of these machines is seen on the right of the\r\nboiler above referred to, and another in the left-hand corner of the\r\nroom quite in the back-ground. Near the fore-ground, on the left, is\r\nseen a forge, where any small mass of iron may be heated, as occasion\r\nmay require.\r\n\r\nThe semi-cylindrical piece which lies in the centre of the room, toward\r\nthe fore-ground, is part of a locomotive boiler, and is of course much\r\nsmaller in size than the others, though it is constructed in the same\r\nmanner with the large boilers used for sea-going ships. The process of\r\nriveting, as will be seen by the engraving, is the same. One man holds\r\nup against the under side of the plate a support for the rivet, while\r\ntwo men with hammers form a head above--striking alternately upon the\r\niron which protrudes.\r\n\r\nFrom the boiler we proceed to the cylinder, which is in fact the _heart_\r\nof the engine,--the seat and centre of its power. It is to the cylinder\r\nthat the steam, quietly generated in the boiler, comes to exercise its\r\nenergy, by driving, alternately up and down, the ponderous piston. The\r\ncylinder must be strong so as to resist the vast expansive force which\r\nis exercised within it. It must be stiff, so as to preserve in all\r\ncircumstances its exact form. It must be substantial, so as to allow of\r\nbeing turned and polished on its interior surface with mathematical\r\nprecision, in order that the piston in ascending and descending, may\r\nglide smoothly up and down, without looseness, and at the same time\r\nwithout friction. To answer these conditions it is necessary that it\r\nshould be formed of cast iron.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders are cast, accordingly, in the iron foundry, which, as will\r\nbe seen by the plan, is on the left, as the visitor enters the works.\r\nThere is a range of monstrous cranes extending through the interior of\r\nthe room, as represented in the plan, one of which is exhibited\r\nconspicuously in the engraving below. At different places in the ground,\r\nbeneath this foundry, for it has no floor, there have been excavated\r\ndeep pits, some of which are twelve feet in diameter and eighteen feet\r\ndeep, the sides of which are secured by strong inclosures, formed of\r\nplates of boiler iron riveted together. These pits are filled with\r\nmoulding sand--a composition of a damp and tenacious character, used in\r\nmoulding. The mould is made and lowered into one of these pits, the pit\r\nis filled up, the sand being rammed as hard as possible all around it.\r\nWhen all is ready, the top of the mould, with the cross by which it is\r\nto be lifted and lowered surmounting it, presents the appearance\r\nrepresented on the right hand lower corner of the engraving below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CASTING A CYLINDER.]\r\n\r\nA reservoir to contain the melted metal necessary for the casting is\r\nthen placed in a convenient position near it, with a channel or conduit\r\nleading from it to the mould. This reservoir may be seen in the\r\nengraving near the centre of the view, at the foot of the crane. An\r\ninclined plane is then laid, as seen in the engraving, to the left of\r\nthe reservoir, up which the workmen carry the molten metal in ladles,\r\nwhich, though they do not appear very large, it requires _five men_ to\r\ncarry. A party carrying such a ladle may be seen in the engraving in the\r\nback-ground on the left. These ladles are filled from the various\r\nfurnaces, the iron throwing out an intense heat, and projecting the most\r\nbrilliant scintillations in every direction, as it flows. In the case of\r\nthe largest castings it requires sometimes four or five hours to get\r\ntogether, from the furnaces, a sufficient supply of metal. The largest\r\nreservoir thus filled will hold about thirty tons of iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FILLING THE LADLES.]\r\n\r\nThe flowing of the metal from the reservoir to the mould in a great\r\ncasting, forms a magnificent spectacle. The vast mass of molten iron in\r\nthe reservoir, the stream flowing down the conduit, throwing out the\r\nmost brilliant corruscations, the gaseous flames issuing from the upper\r\nportions of the mould, and the currents of melted iron which sometimes\r\noverflow and spread, like mimic streams of lava, over the ground,\r\npresent in their combination quite an imposing pyrotechnic display. In\r\nfact there is a chance for the visitor, in the case of castings of a\r\ncertain kind, that he may be treated to an explosion as a part of the\r\nspectacle. The imprisoned vapors and gases which are formed in the mould\r\nbelow, break out sometimes with considerable violence, scattering the\r\nburning and scintillating metal in every direction around.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EXPLOSION.]\r\n\r\nWhen the casting is completed it is of course allowed to remain\r\nundisturbed until the iron has had time to cool, and then the whole mass\r\nis to be dug out of the pit in which it is imbedded. So much heat,\r\nhowever, still remains in the iron and in the sand surrounding it, that\r\nthe mould itself and the twenty or thirty men engaged in disinterring\r\nit, are enveloped in dense clouds of vapor which rise all around them\r\nwhile the operation is proceeding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIGGING OUT THE CYLINDER.]\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that the sand which surrounds these moulds should be\r\nrammed down in the most compact and solid manner to sustain the sides of\r\nthe mould and enable them to resist the enormous pressure to which it is\r\nsubject, especially in the lower portions, while the iron continues\r\nfluid. In the case of iron, the weight of four inches in height is\r\nequivalent to the pressure of a pound upon the square inch. In a pit,\r\ntherefore, eighteen feet deep, as some of the pits at this foundry are,\r\nwe should have a pressure at the bottom of fifty-four pounds to the\r\ninch. Now, in the most powerful sea-going steamers, the pressure of\r\nsteam at which the engines are worked, is seldom more than _eighteen_\r\npounds to the inch; that of the Cunard line is said to be from twelve to\r\nfifteen, and that of the Collins line from fifteen to eighteen. In other\r\nwords there is a pressure to be resisted at the lower ends of these long\r\ncastings equal to three times that at which the most powerful low\r\npressure engines are worked, and which sometimes results in such\r\nterrific explosions.\r\n\r\nWhen the cylinder is freed from the pressure of the sand around it, in\r\nits bed, the great iron cross by which the mould was lowered into the\r\npit, as seen in the engraving of the Casting, is once more brought down\r\nto its place, and the stirrups at the tops of the iron rods seen in the\r\nengraving below, are brought over the ends of the arms of the cross. The\r\nlower ends of these rods take hold of a frame or platform below, upon\r\nwhich the whole mould, together with the cylinder within it, is\r\nsupported. The arm of the crane is then brought round to the spot. The\r\nhook pendant from it is attached to the ring in the centre of the cross,\r\nand by means of the wheels and machinery of the crane, the whole is\r\nslowly hoisted out, and then swung round to some convenient level, where\r\nthe ponderous mass is freed from its casing of masonry, and brought out\r\nat last to open day. It is then thoroughly examined with a view to the\r\ndiscovery of any latent flaw or imperfection, and, if found complete in\r\nevery part, is conveyed away to be the subject of a long series of\r\nfinishing operations in another place,--operations many and complicated,\r\nbut all essential to enable it finally to fulfill its functions.\r\n\r\nThese cylinders though very massive and ponderous are not the heaviest\r\ncastings made. They are much exceeded in weight by what is called a bed\r\nplate, which is an enormous frame of iron cast in one mass, or else in\r\ntwo or three separate masses and then strongly bolted together, to form\r\na foundation on which the engine is to rest in the hold of the ship. The\r\nbed plate can not be seen in the view of the engine room already given,\r\nas it lies below the floor, being underneath all the machinery. A bed\r\nplate weighs sometimes thirty-five tons--which is the weight of about\r\nfive hundred men. Such a mass as this has to be transported on ways,\r\nlike those used in the launching of a ship. It is drawn along upon these\r\nways by blocks and pullies, and when brought alongside the ship is\r\nhoisted on board by means of an enormous derrick, and let down slowly to\r\nthe bottom of the hold--the place where it is finally to repose, unless\r\nperchance it should at last be liberated by some disaster, from this\r\ndungeon, and sent to seek its ultimate destination in the bottom of the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe engraving below represents the forges, where all those parts of the\r\nmachinery are formed and fitted which consist of wrought iron. The room\r\nin which these forges are situated is called the smith's shop, in the\r\nplan. In the back-ground, a little to the right, is one of the trip\r\nhammers, in the act of striking. The trip-hammer is a massive hammer\r\ncarried by machinery. The machinery which drives it may at any time be\r\nthrown in or out of gear, so that the blows of the hammer are always\r\nunder the control of the workman. The iron bar to be forged is far too\r\nheavy to be held by hand. It is accordingly supported as seen in the\r\nengraving, by a crane; and only guided to its place upon the anvil by\r\nthe workmen who have hold of it. The chain to which this bar is\r\nsuspended comes down from a little truck which rests upon the top of the\r\ncrane, and which may be made to traverse to and fro, thus carrying\r\nwhatever is suspended from it further outward, or drawing it in, as may\r\nbe required. All the cranes, both in the smith's shop and in the\r\nfoundry, are fitted with the same contrivance. These trucks are moved by\r\nmeans of a wheel at the foot of the crane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FORGES.]\r\n\r\nOn the extreme right of the picture, and somewhat in the distance, may\r\nbe seen another trip-hammer with a bar upon the anvil beneath it, this\r\nbar being suspended likewise from a crane. When the iron becomes too\r\ncold to yield any longer to the percussion, the hammer is stopped, the\r\ncrane is swung round, and the iron is replaced in the forge to be heated\r\nanew; and at length, when heated, it is brought back again under the\r\nhammer as before.\r\n\r\nThe forging of shafts requires heavier machinery even than this. The\r\nenormous mass of iron that is in this case to be forged, is bricked up\r\nin a furnace to be heated, and remains there many hours. The masonry is\r\nthen broken away and the red hot beam is swung round under the hammer,\r\nas seen below. It is suspended from the crane by heavy chains, and is\r\nguided by the workmen by means of iron handles clamped to it at a\r\ndistance from the heated part, as seen in the engraving in the adjoining\r\ncolumn. The hammer is lifted by means of the cam below it, as seen in\r\nthe engraving below. This cam is a projection from an axis revolving\r\nbeneath the floor, and which, as it revolves, carries the cams\r\nsuccessively against a projection upon the under side of the hammer,\r\nwhich is partly concealed in the engraving by the figure of the man.\r\nWhen the point of the cam has passed beyond the projection it allows the\r\nhammer to fall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEATING A SHAFT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FORGING A SHAFT.]\r\n\r\nWhile the process of forging such a shaft is going on, one man throws\r\nwater upon the work, to effect some purpose connected with the scaling\r\nof the iron, while another, with an instrument called the callipers,\r\nmeasures the diameter of the shaft, to regulate the size, as the forging\r\nproceeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LATHES.]\r\n\r\nThe shafts, when forged, are to be turned in a lathe, and the engine\r\nused for this purpose is represented on the left in the engraving below.\r\nThe shaft itself is seen in the lathe, while the tool which cuts it as\r\nit revolves, is fixed firmly in the \"rest,\" which slides along the side.\r\nThe point of the tool is seen in the engraving, with the spiral shaving\r\nwhich it cuts falling down from it. The shaft is made to revolve by the\r\nband seen coming down obliquely from above, at the hither end of the\r\nengine. The wheel by which the band turns the lathe has different\r\ngrooves at different distances from the centre, in order that the\r\nworkmen may regulate the velocity of the rotation--as different degrees\r\nof velocity are required for the different species of work. The _rest_,\r\nto which the cutting tool is attached, is brought slowly along the side\r\nof the shaft as the shaft revolves, by means of a long screw which is\r\nconcealed in the frame of the lathe, and which is turned continually by\r\nthe mechanism of the small wheels which are seen at the hither end of\r\nthe engine.\r\n\r\nOn the right hand of this view is represented another kind of lathe\r\ncalled a _face lathe_, which is employed for turning wheels, and flat\r\nplates, and interiors of cavities, and such other pieces of work as do\r\nnot furnish two opposite points of support. In the fore-ground are a\r\ncompany of men drawing a massive piece of iron upon a truck, destined\r\napparently to be turned in the left hand lathe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FINISHING.]\r\n\r\nAlthough thus a great part of the work in respect to all the details of\r\nthe engine, is performed by machinery, much remains after all to be\r\nwrought and fashioned by hand. In passing through the establishment the\r\nvisitor finds the workmen engaged in these labors, in every conceivable\r\nattitude and position. One man is filing a curved surface with a curved\r\nfile, another is hidden almost wholly from view within a great misshapen\r\nbox of iron: a third is mounted upon a ladder, and is slowly boring\r\nthrough the wall of some monstrous formation, or cutting away\r\nexcrescences of iron from some massive casting with a cold chisel. In a\r\nword, the details are so endlessly varied as to excite the wonder of the\r\nbeholder that any human head should have been capable of containing\r\nthem all, so as to have planned and arranged the fitting of such\r\ncomplicated parts with any hope of their ever coming rightly together.\r\n\r\nThey do come together, however, at last, and then follows the excitement\r\nof the trial. There is nothing more striking in the history of the\r\nconstruction of a steam engine than this, that there can be no partial\r\nor private tests of the work by the workmen in the course of its\r\nprogress--but every thing remains in suspense until all is complete, and\r\nthe ship and the machinery are actually ready for sea. The immense and\r\nponderous masses which constitute the elements of the mighty structure\r\nare hoisted slowly on board and let down into their places. Multitudes\r\nof men are incessantly employed for many weeks in arranging the limbs\r\nand members of the monster, and in screwing and bolting every thing into\r\nits place. Still nothing can be tried. The machinery is too ponderous\r\nand massive to be put in action by any power less than that of the\r\nmighty mover on which its ultimate performance is to depend; and this\r\nmover has not yet been called into being.\r\n\r\nAt length the day of trial arrives. The engineers, the workmen, the\r\nowners, and perhaps many spectators, have assembled to watch the result.\r\nThe boiler is filled; the fires are lighted. Hour after hour the process\r\ngoes on of raising the force and pressure of the steam. All this time,\r\nhowever, the machinery lies inert and lifeless. It is a powerless mass\r\nof dead and heavy brass and iron. At length an engineer, standing upon a\r\nplatform, with a lever in his hand, receives the signal, opens the\r\nvalve, and breathes into the monstrous body the breath of life. The\r\nponderous piston slowly rises; the beam descends; the crank turns; the\r\nvast paddles revolve, and the monster walks away through the water with\r\nits enormous burden, having leaped suddenly, at its first breath, into\r\nthe complete and full possession of its gigantic powers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEPARTURE OF THE PACIFIC FOR EUROPE.]\r\n\r\nIn due time the equipment is complete, and the ship having received on\r\nboard its burden of costly cargo and valuable lives, moves away from\r\nthe shore, with a certain expression of calm and quiet dignity in her\r\nappearance and demeanor, which almost seems to denote a consciousness on\r\nher part of the vast responsibilities which she is assuming, and of the\r\nabundant power which she possesses fully to sustain them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARLES WOLFE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is probable that to many of our readers the name which stands at the\r\nhead of this sketch is unknown, and that those who recognize it will\r\nonly know it as that of the author of the well-known lines upon the\r\ndeath of Sir John Moore--a lyric of such surpassing beauty, that so\r\nhigh a judge as Lord Byron considered it the perfection of English\r\nlyrical poetry, preferring it before Coleridge's lines on\r\nSwitzerland--Campbell's Hohenlinden--and the finest of Moore's Irish\r\nmelodies, which were instanced by Shelley and others. Yet, unknown as\r\nthe Rev. Charles Wolfe is, it is unquestionable that he was a man\r\npossessing the highest powers of imagination, and a powerful intellect,\r\ncultivated to a very high point of perfection, and fitting him to become\r\none of the brightest stars of the world of literature. Why he is unknown\r\nis then probably a question which will suggest itself to the minds of\r\nmany, and the answer must be, because he _did_ so little for the world\r\nto remember him by. The whole of his literary remains, including his\r\nsermons, and a biographical sketch, which fills one half of the book, is\r\ncontained in a moderate sized octavo volume, published after his death\r\nby the Rev. J. A. Russell, Archdeacon of Clogher, whose affection for\r\nthe memory of Mr. Wolfe prompted him to edit and give to the world the\r\nfragmentary manuscripts, which are the only lasting and appreciable\r\nrecords of the residence of a great spirit among us. But it may be asked\r\nwhy, with such capabilities and powers as we have stated Mr. Wolfe to\r\npossess, he did so little? and to that interrogation many replies may be\r\ngiven. Mr. Wolfe died at the early age of 32, just when the powers are\r\nin their full vigor--and in the later years of his life he had devoted\r\nhimself enthusiastically to the duties which devolved upon him as the\r\ncurate of a large and populous parish in the north of Ireland. Neither\r\nof these reasons, however, is sufficient, for we know that the poetic\r\nintellect is precocious, and brings forth fruit early. Shelley, who died\r\nyounger, left productions behind him, which will hand his name down to\r\nthe latest posterity; and the comparatively voluminous writings of the\r\nwitty dean, Sidney Smith, prove that a man may bear the weight of the\r\nclerical office, and take an active part in politics in addition, and\r\nyet leave enough behind him to keep his name green in the memory of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe true reason why Mr. Wolfe did so little is no doubt to be found in\r\nthe character of his mind, and this is easily traceable, both in the\r\nmild, child-like, almost simple, but intelligent expression of the\r\nportrait which forms a frontispiece to the volume to which we have\r\nadverted, and in most of the passages of his life. There was a want of\r\nstrong resolution, and an absence of concentration so marked, that he\r\nseldom read completely through even those books which most deeply\r\ninterested him--there was a nervous susceptibility, and an openness to\r\nnew impressions, which caused him as it were to dwell upon every passage\r\nhe did read, to linger over its beauties, to start objections to its\r\ntheories, to argue them out, and to develop to its fullest every\r\nsuggestive thought; and there was in him a spirit of good-nature\r\ntrenching upon weak compliance, which put his time at the service of all\r\nwho chose to thrust employment upon him. Added to this, and arising out\r\nof his want of steady resolution and earnest will, there was a habit of\r\nputting off till to-morrow what should be done to-day, of which he was\r\nhimself fully sensible, and which he speaks of in one of his letters, as\r\nthat \"fatal habit of delay and procrastination, for which I am so\r\npre-eminently distinguished.\"\r\n\r\nCharles Wolfe was the youngest son of Theobald Wolfe, Esq., of\r\nBlackball, in the County of Kildare, Ireland, and was born in Dublin on\r\nthe 13th of December, 1791. The family was not unknown to fame, for the\r\ncelebrated General Wolfe, who fell at Quebec, was one of its members,\r\nand Lord Kilwarden, an eminent man at the Irish bar, and who was\r\nafterward elevated to the dignity of a judgeship, was another. At an\r\nearly age the father of our hero died, and the family removed to\r\nEngland, where Charles Wolfe was sent to a school at Bath. Here,\r\nhowever, at the age of ten years, his studies were interrupted by\r\nfailing health for a period of twelve months. After that, he was in the\r\nestablishment of Dr. Evans, of Salisbury; and in 1805 we find him at\r\nWinchester school, under the superintendence of Mr. Richards, senior.\r\nHere he became conspicuous for his classical knowledge, and his great\r\npowers of versification, which gave promise of future excellence. What\r\nappears more distinctly, though, than his mental ability at this age,\r\nwas the amiability of his disposition, and the tractability of his\r\nnature. His kindness, cheerfulness, and open sympathy drew to him the\r\nlove of his fellows; and the esteem in which he was held by his masters\r\nmay be judged from the fact, that during the whole period of his\r\npupilage his conduct never drew down upon him punishment, or even a\r\nreprimand. His tender and affectionate disposition endeared him to his\r\nown family, with whom he was an especial favorite; and in connection\r\nwith this, we may mention one circumstance strongly indicative of his\r\nyielding character. In spite of his gentle nature, he, animated no doubt\r\nby that desire for glory so common to poetical minds, and which, looking\r\non the brighter side of war, hides its terrors and its horrors from the\r\nyoung and ardent, wished to enter the army; but finding that the idea\r\ngave pain to his mother, he immediately abandoned the notion, and\r\nappears from thenceforth to have looked upon the clerical office as his\r\ndestined part in life. Strange transition, from the aspiration to carry\r\nforth death and destruction to that of being the bearer of the glad\r\ntidings of \"peace on earth, and good-will toward men.\" The change,\r\nhowever, is one which we believe to be not unfrequent. The same desire\r\nfor fame urges men to the bar, the pulpit, and the tented field, and but\r\nfor maternal love, Charles Wolfe, carrying with him that martial spirit\r\nwhich now and then breaks out in his poetry, might have been like his\r\nnamesake, the General, a blood-stained hero, instead of a peaceful,\r\nloving Irish curate. So powerful are circumstances to mould man's\r\nfate--and Wolfe was of that mould on which circumstances act with\r\npeculiar force. Had he been a soldier, it may be that the occupation\r\nwould have strengthened his _physique_ at the expense of his mentality,\r\nand that his bodily powers, unimpaired by sedentary habits, would have\r\ncarried him on to a good old age. There is food for reflection in that\r\nidea, of how every course in life has its mixed good and evil.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 the family returned to Ireland, and in 1809 Charles Wolfe became\r\na student of Dublin University. Here his classical learning and poetical\r\nattainments soon made him conspicuous, and he carried off prizes from\r\nthe most distinguished of his competitors. The Historical Society of the\r\nUniversity, the object of which was the cultivation of history, poetry,\r\nand oratory, also afforded him scope for the display of his talents, and\r\ngave him opportunity to win several medals and prizes. Most of the few\r\npoetical efforts of Mr. Wolfe were made at this period, including the\r\nDeath of Sir John Moore, and a beautiful song, connected with which is\r\nan anecdote so strikingly characteristic of the nature of the author's\r\nmind, and so indicative of his extreme sensibility, that it is worth\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\nHe was particularly open to the influence of music, and one of his\r\nfavorite melodies was the popular Irish air \"Gramachree,\" to which, at\r\nthe request of a friend, he wrote the following song:\r\n\r\n    \"If I had thought thou could'st have died,\r\n      I might not weep for thee:\r\n    But I forgot, when by thy side,\r\n      That thou could'st mortal be:\r\n    It never through my mind had pass'd,\r\n      The time would e'er be o'er,\r\n    And I on thee should look my last,\r\n      And thou should'st smile no more!\r\n\r\n    \"And still upon that face I look,\r\n      And think 'twill smile again;\r\n    And still the thought I will not brook,\r\n      That I must look in vain!\r\n    But when I speak thou dost not say,\r\n      What thou ne'er left'st unsaid;\r\n    And now I feel, as well I may,\r\n      Sweet Mary! thou art dead!\r\n\r\n    \"If thou would'st stay, e'en as thou art,\r\n      All cold, and all serene--\r\n    I still might press thy silent heart,\r\n      And where thy smiles have been!\r\n    While e'en thy chill, bleak corse I have,\r\n      Thou seemest still mine own;\r\n    But there I lay thee in thy grave--\r\n      And I am now alone.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not think, where'er thou art,\r\n      Thou hast forgotten me;\r\n    And I, perhaps, may soothe this heart,\r\n      In thinking too of thee:\r\n    Yet there was round thee such a dawn\r\n      Of light ne'er seen before,\r\n    As fancy never could have drawn,\r\n      And never can restore.\"\r\n\r\nHis friends asked him whether he had any real incident in his mind which\r\nsuggested the stanzas; he said, \"he had not; but that he had sung the\r\nair over and over, till he burst into a flood of tears, in which mood he\r\ncomposed the words.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first year of Mr. Wolfe's attendance at the university, death\r\ntook his mother, to whom he was most affectionately attached--an event\r\nwhich for some time interrupted his studies, and when he resumed them,\r\nhe did not manifest much inclination to apply himself to the exact\r\nsciences. Here, however, that kindness of disposition which made him\r\nmore useful to others than to himself, and induced him to neglect his\r\nown interests, and lend himself to those of his friends with an almost\r\nfatal facility, came to his aid, and stood him in good stead. The desire\r\nto assist a less gifted acquaintance impelled him to study more\r\nstrenuously than he would have done, for his own benefit, and had the\r\neffect of so drawing out his own talents for scientific pursuits, that\r\nat an examination upon the severer sciences he carried away the prize\r\nfrom a host of talented candidates. Soon after, when his straitened\r\ncircumstances induced him to become a college tutor, he found the\r\nbenefit of his scientific acquirements; but in that capacity his\r\namiability of character was a disadvantage to him, for he was so anxious\r\nfor the progress of his pupils, and so prodigal of his time and labor\r\nupon them, that he had but little opportunity for his own studies, or\r\nfor relaxation.\r\n\r\nAfter the usual period at the university, Mr. Wolfe took a scholarship,\r\nwith the highest honors, and went into residence, and in 1814 he took\r\nthe degree of Bachelor of Arts. His friends, seeing the talents he\r\nevinced for scientific pursuits, urged him to read for a fellowship, and\r\nfor some time he prosecuted his studies with marked effect; but the want\r\nof the power of continuous application, and intense concentration, made\r\nhim the sport of every trifling interruption, and the habit he had of\r\nthrowing aside books partly read, and dwelling upon striking passages\r\nand disputable theories, impeded his progress. It is probable, however,\r\nthat with his great mental facilities, a less amount of exertion would\r\nhave sufficed than with less gifted students, and that despite his want\r\nof industrial energy, and his unfavorable habits of mind, he would have\r\nsucceeded, but he was doomed to be disappointed in a manner which must\r\nhave had a very depressing effect on a mind constituted as his was. He\r\nhad formed an intimacy with a family in the vicinity of Dublin, and\r\nwhile his visits to the beautiful scenery in which their dwelling was\r\nsituated, stimulated his poetical faculties, the charms of a daughter of\r\nthe house touched the sensitive heart of the young scholar. The\r\nattachment was mutual, and ripened apace, but his want of \"prospects\"\r\ninduced the prudent parents to break off the intimacy. The expectant\r\nfellowship indeed would have afforded him sufficient means, but a\r\nbarbarous statute was in force which imposed celibacy upon the fellows,\r\nand barred his hopes. If this disappointment had happened to a man of\r\nstrong resolute will it would, in all likelihood, after the first shock\r\nwas over, have thrown him back upon his studies more determinedly than\r\never, but on a nature like that of our hero, it had the contrary effect.\r\nIt damped his ardor, he lost both his mistress and the chance of\r\npreferment; and, turning to religion for consolation, he was ordained in\r\nNovember, 1817, and shortly after was engaged in temporary duty in the\r\nNorth of Ireland, and finally settled as curate of Donoughmore, where he\r\ncontinued the greater part of the remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nFor the occupation of the ministry, Mr. Wolfe, notwithstanding his\r\nyouthful military tendency and love of society, was eminently fitted.\r\nHis mind was naturally of a devotional cast, and fitted peculiarly for\r\nhis new position. He was thoroughly in earnest--the strong impulse\r\nsupplied by intense devotional feeling served to counteract his want of\r\napplication. The kindness of his heart, and the desire to serve others,\r\nwhich was so prominent a feature of his mind, made him untiring; the\r\ndislike of contest which marked him led him to dwell on the vital points\r\ncommon to all religions, and avoid controversial ground. That want of\r\nself-esteem, too, which at the university had ever made him distrustful\r\nof his own powers, and kept him from claiming the stanzas on Sir John\r\nMoore, when they were claimed by, or attributed to others, induced him\r\nto converse familiarly with the peasant, and to submit to contradiction\r\nand even insult from those who, both socially and intellectually, were\r\ninferior to himself. Add to this, that he thoroughly understood the\r\nIrish character, which had many points in common with his own impulsive\r\nversatile nature, and it may be conceived how influential he was in his\r\nremote curacy. Presbyterian, Methodist, Catholic, all gathered round him\r\nand often filled his little church, listening to his concise,\r\nplain-spoken sermons, which far oftener treated of the hopes and mercies\r\nthan the terrors and punishments of Christianity, and in his parish\r\nschool the children of all denominations were taught together. This,\r\nhowever, was not to last long. He had applied himself too assiduously to\r\nhis task for his physical strength. Oppressed with a sense of the\r\nresponsibility of his position he had, upon entering upon the ministry,\r\ngiven up all thoughts of literature. He lived in an old, half-furnished\r\nhouse, slept in a damp room, and traversed bog and moor on foot in all\r\nweathers to visit his flock. Under these labors the latent tendency of\r\nhis constitution developed itself, his cough became day by day more\r\nviolent, and in 1821 it was evident that consumption had laid its hand\r\nupon its prey. Still he was unwilling to retire from his ministry, and\r\nit was only in compliance with the reiterated entreaties of his friends\r\nthat he at last proceeded to Scotland to consult a celebrated physician.\r\nHis return to his parish after that short absence proved the estimation\r\nin which he was held among the people. As he rode by the cabins of the\r\npeasantry, the occupants rushed out, and, with all the impulsive\r\ndevotion of the Irish toward those whom they regard as benefactors, fell\r\nupon their knees, and invoked blessings upon him, and pursued the\r\ncarriage in which he rode, with fervent prayers. His health, however,\r\nstill continued to fail, and his friends at length persuaded him to\r\nremove to Dublin, where he continued to preach occasionally, till his\r\nphysician forbade such effort, and to use his own words, \"stripped him\r\nof his gown.\" Toward the winter of 1821, it was thought advisable to\r\nremove him to Bordeaux for a time, but adverse gales twice drove him\r\nback to Holyhead, and he suffered so much from fatigue and sea-sickness\r\nthat it appeared best to locate him near Exeter, where he staid till the\r\nspring of 1822, in the house of a clergyman, whose practice among the\r\npoor had qualified him to act the part of a physician to the invalid. In\r\nthe spring, apparently somewhat improved, he returned to Dublin, and in\r\nthe summer made a short voyage to Bordeaux, where he staid about a\r\nmonth. He then again returned to Dublin, and from that time steadily\r\ndeclined. In November, 1822, accompanied by a relative and the Rev. Mr.\r\nRussell, his biographer, he removed to the Cove of Cork, but all efforts\r\nto recruit his failing strength were unavailing, and he expired there on\r\nthe 21st of February, 1823, in the 32d year of his age. About a\r\ntwelvemonth previous to his death, he had been preferred to the\r\nimportant curacy of Armagh, but he never lived to visit his new parish.\r\nAll the letters written during his protracted illness prove his\r\namiability, and the patience with which he suffered, as well as the\r\nardor of the Christian faith on which he so confidently leaned, and few\r\nmen were more sincerely mourned by a large number of devoted and\r\nadmiring friends.\r\n\r\nCharles Wolfe was one of those characters eminently fitted to make good\r\nmen, but destitute of some of the qualities for what the world calls\r\ngreatness. He was a high type of that class who form the cynosure of\r\ntheir own peculiar circles, where they are admired as much for the\r\nkindliness of their nature as the extent of their attainments, and the\r\npower and versatility of their talents. But wanting the self-esteem, the\r\nunwavering self-confidence, the perseverance and unshaken resolution\r\nwhich go to make up greatness, he possessed in an eminent degree those\r\nkindly sympathies, tender feelings, and that earnest devotion to the\r\ninterests and wishes of his fellows, which among friends and intimates\r\nmake goodness so much more lovable than greatness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURICE TIERNAY, THE SOLDIER OF FORTUNE.\r\n\r\n(_Continued from Page 478._)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nA REMNANT OF \"FONTENOY.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no resisting the inquisitive curiosity of my companion. The\r\nshort, dry cough, the little husky \"ay,\" that sounded like any thing\r\nrather than assent, which followed on my replies to his questions, and,\r\nmore than all, the keen, oblique glances of his shrewd gray eyes, told\r\nme that I had utterly failed in all my attempts at mystification, and\r\nthat he read me through and through.\r\n\r\n\"And so,\" said he, at last, after a somewhat lengthy narrative of my\r\nshipwreck, \"and so the Flemish sailors wear spurs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Spurs! of course not; why should they?\" asked I, in some astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Well, but don't they?\" asked he again.\r\n\r\n\"No such thing; it would be absurd to suppose it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I thought,\" rejoined he; \"and when I looked at yer 'honor's' boots\r\n(it was the first time he had addressed me by this title of deference),\r\nand saw the marks on the heel for spurs, I soon knew how much of a\r\nsailor you were.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if not a sailor, what am I, then?\" asked I; for, in the loneliness\r\nof the mountain region where we walked, I could afford to throw off my\r\ndisguise without risk.\r\n\r\n\"Ye'r a French officer of dragoons, and God bless ye; but ye'r young to\r\nbe at the trade. Arn't I right now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not very far from it certainly, for I am a lieutenant of hussars,\" said\r\nI, with a little of that pride which we of the loose pelisse always feel\r\non the mention of our corps.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it well all along,\" said he, coolly; \"the way you stood in the\r\nroom, your step as you walked, and, above all, how ye believed me when I\r\nspoke of the spring tides, and the moon only in her second quarter, I\r\nsaw you never was a sailor anyhow. And so I set a-thinking what you\r\nwere. You were too silent for a peddler, and your hands were too white\r\nto be in the smuggling trade; but when I saw your boots, I had the\r\nsecret at once, and knew ye were one of the French army that landed the\r\nother day at Killala.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was stupid enough of me not to have remembered the boots!\" said I,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, what use would it be?\" replied he; \"sure ye'r too straight in\r\nthe back, and your walk is too reg'lar, and your toes turns in too much,\r\nfor a sailor; the very way you hould a switch in your hand would betray\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\n\"So it seems; then I must try some other disguise,\" said I, \"if I'm to\r\nkeep company with people as shrewd as you are.\"\r\n\r\n\"You needn't,\" said he, shaking his head, doubtfully; \"any that wants to\r\nbetray ye, wouldn't find it hard.\"\r\n\r\nI was not much flattered by the depreciating tone in which he dismissed\r\nmy efforts at personation, and walked on for some time without\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n\"Yez came too late, four months too late,\" said he, with a sorrowful\r\ngesture of the hands. \"When the Wexford boys was up, and the Kildare\r\nchaps, and plenty more ready to come in from the North, then, indeed, a\r\nfew thousand French down here in the West would have made a differ; but\r\nwhat's the good in it now? The best men we had are hanged, or in jail;\r\nsome are frightened; more are traitors! 'Tis too late--too late!\"\r\n\r\n\"But not too late for a large force, landing in the North, to rouse the\r\nisland to another effort for liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who would be the gin'ral?\" asked he, suddenly.\r\n\r\n\"Napper Tandy, your own countryman,\" replied I, proudly.\r\n\r\n\"I wish ye luck of him!\" said he, with a bitter laugh; \"'tis more like\r\nmocking us than any thing else the French does be, with the chaps they\r\nsent here to be gin'rals. Sure it isn't Napper Tandy, nor a set of young\r\nlawyers, like Tone and the rest of them, we wanted. It was men that knew\r\nhow to drill and manage troops--fellows that was used to fightin'; so\r\nthat when they said a thing, we might believe that they understhood it,\r\nat laste. I'm ould enough to remimber the 'Wild Geese,' as they used to\r\ncall them--the fellows that ran away from this to take sarvice in\r\nFrance; and I remimber, too, the sort of men the French were that came\r\nover to inspect them--soldiers, real soldiers, every inch of them: and a\r\nfine sarvice it was. Volle-face!\" cried he, holding himself erect, and\r\nshouldering his stick like a musket; \"marche! Ha, ha! ye didn't think\r\n_that_ was in me; but I was at the thrade long before you were born.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is this,\" said I, in amazement, \"you were not in the French army?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't I, though? maybe I didn't get that stick there.\" And he bared\r\nhis breast as he spoke, to show the cicatrix of an old flesh-wound from\r\na Highlander's bayonet. \"I was at Fontenoy!\"\r\n\r\nThe last few words he uttered, with a triumphant pride, that I shall\r\nnever forget. As for me, the mere name was magical. \"Fontenoy\" was like\r\none of those great words which light up a whole page of history; and it\r\nalmost seemed impossible that I should see before me a soldier of that\r\nglorious battle.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, faith!\" he added, \"'tis more than fifty, 'tis nigh sixty years now\r\nsince that, and I remember it as if it was yesterday. I was in the\r\nregiment 'Tourville;' I was recruited for the 'Wellon,' but they\r\nscattered us about among the other corps afterward, because we used now\r\nand then to be fighting and quarrelin' among one an' other. Well, it was\r\nthe Wellons that gained the battle; for after the English was in the\r\nvillage of Fontenoy, and the French was falling back upon the heights\r\nnear the wood--arrah, what's the name of the wood?--sure I'll forget my\r\nown name next. Ay, to be sure, Verzon--the 'wood of Verzon.' Major\r\nJodillon--that's what the French called him, but his name was Joe\r\nWellon--turned an eight-pounder short round into a little yard of a\r\nfarm-house, and, making a breach for the gun, he opened a dreadful fire\r\non the English column. It was loaded with grape, and at half-musket\r\nrange, so you may think what a peppering they got. At last the column\r\nhalted, and lay down; and Joe seen an officer ride off to the rear, to\r\nbring up artillery to silence our guns. A few minutes more, and it would\r\nbe all over with us. So Joe shouts out as loud as he could, 'Cavalry\r\nthere! tell off by threes, and prepare to charge!' I needn't tell you\r\nthat the devil a horse nor a rider was within a mile of us at the time;\r\nbut the English didn't know that; and, hearin' the order, up they jumps,\r\nand we heerd the word passin', 'Prepare to receive cavalry!' They formed\r\nsquare at once, and the same minute we plumped into them with such a\r\ncharge as tore a lane right through the middle of them. Before they\r\ncould recover, we opened a platoon fire on their flank; they staggered,\r\nbroke, and at last fell back in disorder upon Aeth, with the whole of\r\nthe French army after them. Such firin'--grape, round-shot, and\r\nmusketry--I never seed afore, and we all shouting like divils, for it\r\nwas more like a hunt nor any thing else; for ye see the Dutch never came\r\nup, but left the English to do all the work themselves, and that's the\r\nreason they couldn't form, for they had no supportin' colum'.\r\n\r\n\"It was then I got that stick of the bayonet, for there was such runnin'\r\nthat we only thought of pelting after them as hard as we could; but ye\r\nsee, there's nothin' so treacherous as a Highlander. I was just behind\r\none, and had my sword-point between his blade-hones, ready to run him\r\nthrough, when he turned short about, and run his bayonet into me under\r\nthe short ribs, and that was all I saw of the battle; for I bled till I\r\nfainted, and never knew more of what happened. 'Tisn't by way of making\r\nlittle of Frenchmen I say it, for I sarved too long wid them for\r\n_that_--but sorra taste of that victory ever they'd see if it wasn't for\r\nthe Wellons, and Major Joe that commanded them! The English knows it\r\nwell, too! Maybe they don't do us many a spite for it to this very day!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what became of you after that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same summer I came over to Scotland with the young Prince Charles,\r\nand was at the battle of Preston-pans afterward; and, what's worse, I\r\nwas at Culloden! Oh, that was the terrible day! We were dead bate before\r\nwe began the battle. We were on the march from one o'clock the night\r\nbefore, under the most dreadful rain ever ye seen! We lost our way\r\ntwice; and, after four hours of hard marching, we found ourselves\r\nopposite a mill-dam we crossed early that same morning; for the guides\r\nled us all astray! Then came ordhers to wheel about face, and go back\r\nagain; and back we went, cursing the blaguards that deceived us, and\r\nalmost faintin' with hunger. Some of us had nothing to eat for two\r\ndays, and the Prince, I seen myself, had only a brown bannock to a\r\nwooden measure of whiskey for his own breakfast. Well, it's no use\r\ntalking, we were bate, and we retreated to Inverness that night, and\r\nnext morning we surrendered and laid down our arms--that is, the\r\n'Regiment du Tournay,' and the 'Voltigeurs de Metz,' the corps I was in\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you return to France?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I made my way back to Ireland, and after loiterin' about home some\r\ntime, and not liking the ways of turning to work again, I took sarvice\r\nwith one Mister Brooke, of Castle Brooke, in Fermanagh, a young man that\r\nwas just come of age, and as great a devil, God forgive me, as ever was\r\nspawned. He was a Protestant, but he didn't care much about one side or\r\nthe other, but only wanted divarsion and his own fun out of the world;\r\nand faix he took it, too! He had plenty of money, was a fine man to look\r\nat, and had courage to face a lion!\r\n\r\n\"The first place we went to was Aix-la-Chapelle, for Mr. Brooke was\r\nnamed something--I forget what--to Lord Sandwich, that was going there\r\nas an embassador. It was a grand life there while it lasted. Such\r\nliveries, such coaches, such elegant dinners every day, I never saw even\r\nin Paris. But my master was soon sent away for a piece of wildness he\r\ndid. There was an ould Austrian there--a Count Riedensegg was his\r\nname--and he was always plottin' and schamin' with this, that, and the\r\nother; buyin' up the sacrets of others, and gettin' at their sacret\r\npapers one way or the other; and at last he begins to thry the same game\r\nwith us; and as he saw that Mr. Brooke was very fond of high play, and\r\nwould bet any thing one offered him, the ould Count sends for a great\r\ngambler from Vienna, the greatest villain, they say, that ever touched a\r\ncard. Ye may have heerd of him, tho' 'twas long ago that he lived, for\r\nhe was well known in them times. He was the Baron von Breckendorf, and a\r\ngreat friend afterward of the Prince Ragint and all the other blaguards\r\nin London.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, the baron arrives in great state, with dispatches, they\r\nsaid, but sorrow other dispatch he carried nor some packs of marked\r\ncards, and a dice-box that could throw sixes whenever ye wanted; and he\r\nputs up at the Grand Hotel, with all his servants in fine liveries, and\r\nas much state as a prince. That very day Mr. Brooke dined with the\r\ncount, and in the evening himself and the baron sits down to the cards;\r\nand, pretending to be only playin' for silver, they were betting a\r\nhundred guineas on every game.\r\n\r\n\"I always heerd that my master was cute with the cards, and that few was\r\nequal to him in any game with pasteboard or ivory; but, be my\r\nconscience, he met his match now, for if it was ould Nick was playin' he\r\ncouldn't do the thrick nater nor the baron. He made every thing come up\r\njust like magic: if he wanted a seven of diamonds, or an ace of spades,\r\nor the knave of clubs, there it was for you.\r\n\r\n\"Most gentlemen would have lost temper at seein' the luck so dead agin'\r\nthem, and every thing goin' so bad, but my master only smiled, and kept\r\nmuttering to himself, 'Faix, it's beautiful; by my conscience it is\r\nelegant; I never saw any body could do it like that.' At last the baron\r\nstops and asks, 'What is it he's saying to himself?' 'I'll tell you\r\nby-and-by,' says my master, 'when we're done playing;' and so on they\r\nwent, betting higher and higher, till at last the stakes wasn't very far\r\nfrom a thousand pounds on a single card. At the end, Mr. Brooke lost\r\nevery thing, and in the last game, by way of generosity, the baron says\r\nto him, 'Double or quit?' and he tuk it.\r\n\r\n\"This time luck stood to my master, and he turned the queen of hearts;\r\nand as there was only one card could beat him, the game was all as one\r\nas his own. The baron takes up the pack, and begins to deal, 'Wait,'\r\nsays my master, leaning over the table, and talking in a whisper;\r\n'wait,' says he, 'what are ye doin' there wid your thumb?' for sure\r\nenough he had his thumb dug hard into the middle of the pack.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you mane to insult me,' says the baron, getting mighty red, and\r\nthrowing down the cards on the table, 'Is that what you're at?'\r\n\r\n\"'Go on with the deal,' says Mr. Brooke, quietly; 'but listen to me,'\r\nand here he dropped his voice to a whisper, 'as sure as you turn the\r\nking of hearts I'll send a bullet through your skull! Go on now, and\r\ndon't rise from that seat till you've finished the game.' Faix, he just\r\ndid as he was bid; he turned a little two or three of diamonds, and\r\ngettin' up from the table, he left the room, and the next morning there\r\nwas no more seen of him in Aix-la-Chapelle. But that wasn't the end of\r\nit, for scarce was the baron two posts on his journey, when my master\r\nsends in his name, and says he wants to speak to Count Riedensegg. There\r\nwas a long time, and a great debatin', I believe, whether they'd let him\r\nin or not; for the count couldn't make if it was mischief he was after;\r\nbut at last he was ushered into the bedroom where the other was in bed.\r\n\r\n\"'Count,' says he, after he fastened the door, and saw that they was\r\nalone, 'Count, you tried a dirty thrick with that dirty spalpeen of a\r\nbaron--an ould blaguard that's as well known as Freney, the robber--but\r\nI forgive you for it all, for you did it in the way of business. I know\r\nwell what you was afther; you wanted a peep at our dispatches--there, ye\r\nneedn't look cross and angry--why wouldn't ye do it, just as the baron\r\nalways took a sly glance at my cards before he played his own. Well,\r\nnow, I'm just in the humor to sarve you. They're not trating me as they\r\nought here, and I'm going away, and if you'll give me a few letthers to\r\nsome of the pretty women in Vienna, Kateuka Batthyani, and Amalia\r\nGradoffsky, and one or two men in the best set, I'll send you in return\r\nsomething will surprise you.'\r\n\r\n\"It was after a long time and great batin' about the bush, that the ould\r\ncount came in; but the sight of a sacret cipher did the business, and he\r\nconsented.\r\n\r\n\"'There it is,' says Mr. Brooke, 'there's the whole key to our\r\ncorrespondence, study it well, and I'll bring you a sacret dispatch in\r\nthe evening--something that will surprise you.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ye will--will ye?' says the count.\r\n\r\n\"'On the honor of an Irish gentleman, I will,' says Mr. Brooke.\r\n\r\n\"The count sits down on the spot and writes the letters to all the\r\nprincesses and countesses in Vienna, saying that Mr. Brooke was the\r\nelegantest, and politest, and most trusty young gentleman ever he met;\r\nand telling them to treat him with every consideration.\r\n\r\n\"'There will be another account of me,' says the master to me, 'by the\r\npost; but I'll travel faster, and give me a fair start, and I ask no\r\nmore.'\r\n\r\n\"And he was as good as his word, for he started that evening for Vienna,\r\nwithout lave or license, and that's the way he got dismissed from his\r\nsituation.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did he break his promise to the count, or did he really send him\r\nany intelligence?\"\r\n\r\n\"He kept his word like a gentleman; he promised him something that would\r\nsurprise him, and so he did. He sent him the weddin' of Ballyporeen in\r\ncipher. It took a week to make out, and I suppose they've never got to\r\nthe right understandin' it yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm curious to hear how he was received in Vienna after this,\" said I.\r\n\"I suppose you accompanied him to that city.\"\r\n\r\n\"Troth I did, and a short life we led there; but here we are now, at the\r\nend of our journey. That's Father Doogan's down there, that small, low,\r\nthatched house in the hollow.\"\r\n\r\n\"A lonely spot, too. I don't see another near it for miles on any side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor is there. His chapel is at Murrah, about three miles off. My eyes\r\nisn't over good; but I don't think there's any smoke coming out of the\r\nchimley.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right--there is not.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's not at home, then, and that's a bad job for us, for there's not\r\nanother place to stop the night in.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there will be surely some one in the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most likely not; 'tis a brat of a boy from Murrah does be with him when\r\nhe's at home, and I'm sure he's not there now.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply was not very cheering, nor was the prospect itself much\r\nbrighter. The solitary cabin, to which we were approaching, stood in a\r\nrugged glen, the sides of which were covered with a low furze,\r\nintermixed here and there with the scrub of what once had been an oak\r\nforest. A brown, mournful tint was over every thing--sky and landscape\r\nalike; and even the little stream of clear water that wound its twining\r\ncourse along, took the same color from the gravelly bed it flowed over.\r\nNot a cow nor sheep was to be seen, nor even a bird; all was silent and\r\nstill.\r\n\r\n\"There's few would like to pass their lives down there, then!\" said my\r\ncompanion, as if speaking to himself.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose the priest, like a soldier, has no choice in these matters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes he has, though. Father Doogan might have had the pick of the\r\ncounty, they say; but he chose this little quiet spot here. He's a friar\r\nof some ordher abroad, and when he came over, two or three years ago, he\r\ncould only spake a little Irish, and, I believe, less English; but there\r\nwasn't his equal, for other tongues, in all Europe. They wanted him to\r\nstop and be the head of a college somewhere in Spain, but he wouldn't.\r\n'There was work to do in Ireland,' he said, and there he'd go, and to\r\nthe wildest and laste civilized bit of it besides; and ye see that he\r\nwas not far out in his choice when he took Murrah.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he much liked here by the people?\"\r\n\r\n\"They'd worship him, if he'd let them, that's what it is; for if he has\r\nmore larnin' and knowledge in his head than ever a bishop in Ireland,\r\nthere's not a child in the barony his equal for simplicity. He that\r\nknows the names of the stars, and what they do be doing, and where the\r\nworld's going, and what's comin' afther her, hasn't a thought for the\r\nwickedness of this life, no more than a sucking infant! He could tell\r\nyou every crop to put in your ground from this to the day of judgment,\r\nand I don't think he'd know which end of the spade goes into the\r\nground.\"\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus talking, we reached the door, which, as well as the\r\nwindows, was closely barred and fastened. The great padlock, however, on\r\nthe former, with characteristic acuteness, was locked without being\r\nhasped, so that, in a few seconds, my old guide had undone all the\r\nfastenings, and we found ourselves under shelter.\r\n\r\nA roomy kitchen, with a few cooking utensils, formed the entrance hall;\r\nand as a small supply of turf stood in one corner, my companion at once\r\nproceeded to make a fire, congratulating me as he went on with the fact\r\nof our being housed, for a long-threatening thunder storm had already\r\nburst, and the rain was swooping along in torrents.\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus busied I took a ramble through the little cabin,\r\ncurious to see something of the \"interior\" of one whose life had already\r\ninterested me. There were but two small chambers, one at either side of\r\nthe kitchen. The first I entered was a bedroom, the only furniture being\r\na common bed, or a tressel like that of an hospital, a little colored\r\nprint of St. Michael adorning the wall overhead. The bed-covering was\r\ncleanly, but patched in many places, and bespeaking much poverty, and\r\nthe black \"soutane\" of silk that hung against the wall seemed to show\r\nlong years of service. The few articles of any pretension to comfort\r\nwere found in the sitting-room, where a small book-shelf with some\r\nwell-thumbed volumes, and a writing-table covered with papers, maps, and\r\na few pencil-drawings, appeared. All seemed as if he had just quitted\r\nthe spot a few minutes before; the pencil lay across a half-finished\r\nsketch; two or three wild plants were laid within the leaves of a little\r\nbook on botany; and a chess problem, with an open book beside it, still\r\nwaited for solution on a little board, whose workmanship clearly enough\r\nbetrayed it to be by his own hands.\r\n\r\nI inspected every thing with an interest inspired by all I had been\r\nhearing of the poor priest, and turned over the little volumes of his\r\nhumble library to trace, if I might, some clew to his habits in his\r\nreadings. They were all, however, of one cast and character--religious\r\ntracts and offices, covered with annotations and remarks, and showing,\r\nby many signs the most careful and frequent perusal. It was easy to see\r\nthat his taste for drawing or for chess were the only dissipations he\r\npermitted himself to indulge. What a strange life of privation, thought\r\nI, alone and companionless as he must be! and while speculating on the\r\nsense of duty which impelled such a man to accept a post so humble and\r\nunpromising, I perceived that on the wall right opposite to me there\r\nhung a picture, covered by a little curtain of green silk.\r\n\r\nCurious to behold the saintly effigy so carefully enshrined, I drew\r\naside the curtain, and what was my astonishment to find a little colored\r\nsketch of a boy about twelve years old, dressed in the tawdry and\r\nmuch-worn uniform of a drummer. I started. Something flashed suddenly\r\nacross my mind, that the features, the dress, the air, were not unknown\r\nto me. Was I awake, or were my senses misleading me? I took it down and\r\nheld it to the light, and as well as my trembling hands permitted, I\r\nspelled out, at the foot of the drawing, the words \"Le Petit Maurice, as\r\nI saw him last.\" Yes: it was my own portrait, and the words were in the\r\nwriting of my dearest friend in the world, the Père Michael. Scarce\r\nknowing what I did, I ransacked books and papers on every side, to\r\nconfirm my suspicions, and although his name was nowhere to be found, I\r\nhad no difficulty in recognizing his hand, now so forcibly recalled to\r\nmy memory.\r\n\r\nHastening into the kitchen, I told my guide, that I must set out to\r\nMurrah at once, that it was above all important that I should see the\r\npriest immediately. It was in vain that he told me he was unequal to the\r\nfatigue of going further, that the storm was increasing, the mountain\r\ntorrents were swelling to a formidable size, that the path could not be\r\ndiscovered after dark; I could not brook the thought of delay, and would\r\nnot listen to the detail of difficulties. \"I must see him and I will,\"\r\nwere my answers to every obstacle. If I were resolved on one side, _he_\r\nwas no less obstinate on the other; and after explaining with patience\r\nall the dangers and hazards of the attempt, and still finding me\r\nunconvinced, he boldly declared that I might go alone, if I would, but\r\nthat he would not leave the shelter of a roof, such a night, for any\r\none.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the shape of argument I did not essay. I tried\r\nbribery, I tried menace, flattery, intimidation, all--and all with the\r\nlike result. \"Wherever he is to-night, he'll not leave it, that's\r\ncertain,\" was the only satisfaction he would vouchsafe, and I retired\r\nbeaten from the contest, and disheartened. Twice I left the cottage,\r\nresolved to go alone and unaccompanied, but the utter darkness of the\r\nnight, the torrents of rain that beat against my face, soon showed me\r\nthe impracticability of the attempt, and I retraced my steps\r\ncrest-fallen and discomfited. The most intense curiosity to know how and\r\nby what chances he had come to Ireland mingled with my ardent desire to\r\nmeet him. What stores of reminiscence had we to interchange! Nor was it\r\nwithout pride that I bethought me of the position I then held--an\r\nofficer of a Hussar regiment, a soldier of more than one campaign, and\r\nhigh on the list for promotion. If I hoped, too, that many of the good\r\nfather's prejudices against the career I followed would give way to the\r\nrecords of my own past life, I also felt how, in various respects, I had\r\nmyself conformed to many of his notions. We should be dearer, closer\r\nfriends than ever. This I knew and was sure of.\r\n\r\nI never slept the whole night through; tired and weary as the day's\r\njourney had left me, excitement was still too strong for repose, and I\r\nwalked up and down, lay for half an hour on my bed, rose to look out,\r\nand peer for coming dawn! Never did hours lag so lazily. The darkness\r\nseemed to last for an eternity, and when at last day did break, it was\r\nthrough the lowering gloom of skies still charged with rain, and an\r\natmosphere loaded with vapor.\r\n\r\n\"This is a day for the chimney corner, and thankful to have it we ought\r\nto be,\" said my old guide, as he replenished the turf fire, at which he\r\nwas preparing our breakfast. \"Father Doogan will be home here afore\r\nnight, I'm sure, and as we have nothing better to do, I'll tell you some\r\nof our old adventures when I lived with Mr. Brooke. 'Twill sarve to pass\r\nthe time, any way.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm off to Murrah, as soon as I have eaten something,\" replied I.\r\n\r\n\"'Tis little you know what a road it is,\" said he, smiling dubiously.\r\n\"'Tis four mountain rivers you'd have to cross, two of them, at least,\r\ndeeper than your head, and there's the pass of Barnascorny, where you'd\r\nhave to turn the side of a mountain, with a precipice hundreds of feet\r\nbelow you, and a wind blowing that would wreck a seventy-four! There's\r\nnever a man in the barony would venture over the same path, with a storm\r\nragin' from the nor'west.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never heard of a man being blown away off a mountain,\" said I,\r\nlaughing contemptuously.\r\n\r\n\"Arrah, didn't ye then? then maybe ye never tried in parts where the\r\nheaviest plows and harrows that can be laid in the thatch of a cabin are\r\nflung here and there, like straws, and the strongest timbers torn out of\r\nthe walls, and scattered for miles along the coast, like the spars of a\r\nshipwreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"But so long as a man has hands to grip with.\"\r\n\r\n\"How ye talk; sure when the wind can tear the strongest trees up by the\r\nroots; when it rolls big rocks fifty and a hundred feet out of their\r\nplace; when the very shingle on the mountain side is flyin' about like\r\ndust and sand, where would your grip be? It is not only on the mountains\r\neither, but down in the plains, ay, even in the narrowest glens, that\r\nthe cattle lies down under shelter of the rocks; and many's the time a\r\nsheep, or even a heifer, is swept away off the cliffs into the sea.\"\r\n\r\nWith many an anecdote of storm and hurricane he seasoned our little meal\r\nof potatoes. Some curious enough, as illustrating the precautionary\r\nhabits of a peasantry, who, on land, experience many of the vicissitudes\r\nsupposed peculiar to the sea; others too miraculous for easy credence,\r\nbut yet vouched for by him with every affirmative of truth. He displayed\r\nall his powers of agreeability and amusement, but his tales fell on\r\nunwilling ears, and when our meal was over I started up and began to\r\nprepare for the road.\r\n\r\n\"So you will go, will you?\" said he, peevishly. \"'Tis in your country to\r\nbe obstinate, so I'll say nothing more; but maybe 'tis only into\r\nthroubles you'd be running after all!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm determined on it,\" said I, \"and I only ask you to tell me what road\r\nto take.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is only one, so there is no mistakin' it; keep to the sheep path,\r\nand never leave it except at the torrents; you must pass them how ye\r\ncan, and when ye come to four big rocks in the plain leave them to your\r\nleft, and keep the side of the mountain for two miles, 'till ye see the\r\nsmoke of the village underneath you. Murrah is a small place, and ye'll\r\nhave to look out sharp or maybe ye'll miss it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's enough,\" said I, putting some silver in his hand as I pressed\r\nit. \"We'll probably meet no more; good-by, and many thanks for your\r\npleasant company.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we're not like to meet again,\" said he, thoughtfully, \"and that's\r\nthe reason I'd like to give you a bit of advice. Hear me now,\" said he,\r\ndrawing closer and talking in a whisper; \"you can't go far in this\r\ncountry without being known; 'tisn't your looks alone, but your voice,\r\nand your tongue, will show what ye are. Get away out of it as fast as\r\nyou can! there's thraitors in every cause, and there's chaps in Ireland\r\nwould rather make money as informers than earn it by honest industry!\r\nGet over to the Scotch islands; get to Isla or Barra; get any where out\r\nof this for the time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for the counsel,\" said I, somewhat coldly, \"I'll have time to\r\nthink over it as I go along,\" and with these words I set forth on my\r\njourney.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\"THE CRANAGH.\"\r\n\r\nI will not weary my reader with a narrative of my mountain walk, nor the\r\ndangers and difficulties which beset me on that day of storm and\r\nhurricane. Few as were the miles to travel, what with accidents,\r\nmistakes of the path, and the halts to take shelter, I only reached\r\nMurrah as the day was declining.\r\n\r\nThe little village, which consisted of some twenty cabins, occupied a\r\nnarrow gorge between two mountains, and presented an aspect of greater\r\nmisery than I had ever witnessed before, not affording even the humblest\r\nspecimen of a house of entertainment. From some peasants that were\r\nlounging in the street I learned that \"Father Doogan\" had passed through\r\ntwo days before in company with a naval officer, whom they believed to\r\nbe French. At least, \"he came from one of the ships in the Lough, and\r\ncould speak no English.\" Since that the priest had not returned, and\r\nmany thought that he had gone away forever. This story, varied in a few\r\nunimportant particulars, I heard from several; and also learned that a\r\nsquadron of several sail had, for three or four days, been lying at the\r\nentrance of Lough Swilly, with, it was said, large reinforcements for\r\nthe \"army of independence.\" There was then no time to be lost: here was\r\nthe very force which I had been sent to communicate with; there were the\r\ntroops that should at that moment be disembarking. The success of my\r\nmission might all depend now on a little extra exertion, and so I at\r\nonce engaged a guide to conduct me to the coast, and having fortified\r\nmyself with a glass of mountain whiskey, I felt ready for the road. My\r\nguide could only speak a very little English; so that our way was passed\r\nin almost unbroken silence; and, as for security, he followed the least\r\nfrequented paths, we scarcely met a living creature as we went. It was\r\nwith a strange sense of half pride, half despondency, that I bethought\r\nme of my own position there--a Frenchman, alone, and separated from his\r\ncountrymen--in a wild mountain region of Ireland, carrying about him\r\ndocuments that, if detected, might peril his life; involved in a cause\r\nthat had for its object the independence of a nation; and that against\r\nthe power of the mightiest kingdom in Europe. An hour earlier or later,\r\nan accident by the way, a swollen torrent, a chance impediment of any\r\nkind that should delay me--and what a change might that produce in the\r\nwhole destiny of the world. The dispatches I carried conveyed\r\ninstructions the most precise and accurate--the places for combined\r\naction of the two armies--information as to the actual state of parties,\r\nand the condition of the native forces, was contained in them. All that\r\ncould instruct the newly-come generals, or encourage them to decisive\r\nmeasures were there; and, yet, on what narrow contingencies did their\r\nsafe arrival depend! It was thus, in exaggerating to myself the part I\r\nplayed--in elevating my humble position into all the importance of a\r\nhigh trust--that I sustained my drooping spirits, and acquired energy to\r\ncarry me through fatigue and exhaustion. During that night, and the\r\ngreater part of the following day, we walked on, almost without halt,\r\nscarcely eating, and, except by an occasional glass of whisky, totally\r\nunrefreshed; and I am free to own, that my poor guide--a bare-legged\r\nyouth of about seventeen, without any of those high-sustaining illusions\r\nwhich stirred within my heart--suffered far less either from hunger or\r\nweariness than _I_ did. So much for motives. A shilling or two were\r\nsufficient to equalize the balance against all the weight of my heroism\r\nand patriotic ardor together!\r\n\r\nA bright sun, and a sharp wind from the north, had succeeded to the\r\nlowering sky and heavy atmosphere of the morning, and we traveled along\r\nwith light hearts and brisk steps, breasting the side of a deep ascent,\r\nfrom the summit of which my guide told me, I should behold the sea--the\r\nsea, not only the great plain on which I expected to see our armament,\r\nbut the link which bound me to my country! Suddenly, just as I turned\r\nthe angle of a cliff, it burst upon my sight--one vast mirror of golden\r\nsplendor--appearing almost at my feet! In the yellow gleams of a setting\r\nsun, long columns of azure-colored light streaked its calm surface, and\r\ntinged the atmosphere with a warm and rosy hue. While I was lost in\r\nadmiration of the picture, I heard the sound of voices close beneath me,\r\nand, on looking down, saw two figures who, with telescopes in hand, were\r\nsteadily gazing on a little bay that extended toward the west.\r\n\r\nAt first, my attention was more occupied by the strangers than by the\r\nobject of their curiosity, and I remarked that they were dressed and\r\nequipped like sportsmen, their guns and game-bags lying against the rock\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\n\"Do you still think that they are hovering about the coast, Tom?\" said\r\nthe elder of the two, \"or are you not convinced, at last, that I am\r\nright?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you are,\" replied the other; \"but it certainly did not look\r\nlike it yesterday evening, with their boats rowing ashore every half\r\nhour, signals flying, and blue lights burning; all seemed to threaten a\r\nlanding.\"\r\n\r\n\"If they ever thought of it, they soon changed their minds,\" said the\r\nformer. \"The defeat of their comrades in the west, and the apathy of the\r\npeasantry here, would have cooled down warmer ardor than theirs. There\r\nthey go, Tom. I only hope that they'll fall in with Warren's squadron,\r\nand French insolence receive at sea the lesson we failed to give them on\r\nland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" rejoined the younger; \"Humbert's capitulation, and the total\r\nbreak-up of the expedition ought to satisfy even your patriotism.\"\r\n\r\n\"It fell far short of it, then!\" cried the other. \"I'd never have\r\ntreated those fellows other than as bandits and freebooters. I'd have\r\nhanged them as highwaymen. There was less war than rapine; but what\r\ncould you expect? I have been assured that Humbert's force consisted of\r\nlittle other than liberated felons and galley slaves--the refuse of the\r\nworst population of Europe!\"\r\n\r\nDistracted with the terrible tidings I had overheard--overwhelmed with\r\nthe sight of the ships, now glistening like bright specks on the verge\r\nof the horizon, I forgot my own position--my safety--every thing but the\r\ninsult thus cast upon my gallant comrades.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever said so was a liar, and a base coward, to boot!\" cried I,\r\nspringing down from the height and confronting them both where they\r\nstood. They started back, and, seizing their guns, assumed an attitude\r\nof defense, and then, quickly perceiving that I was alone--for the boy\r\nhad taken to flight as fast as he could--they stood regarding me with\r\nfaces of intense astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I, still boiling with passion, \"you are two to one, on your\r\nown soil besides, the odds you are best used to; and yet I repeat it,\r\nthat he who asperses the character of General Humbert's force is a\r\nliar.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's French.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he's Irish,\" muttered the elder. \"What signifies my country, sirs,\"\r\ncried I passionately, \"if I demand retraction for a falsehood.\"\r\n\r\n\"It signifies more than you think of, young man,\" said the elder,\r\ncalmly, and without evincing even the slightest irritation in his\r\nmanner. \"If you be a Frenchman born, the lenity of our government\r\naccords you the privilege of a prisoner of war. If you be only French by\r\nadoption, and a uniform, a harsher destiny awaits you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who says I am a prisoner yet?\" asked I, drawing myself up, and\r\nstaring them steadily in the face.\r\n\r\n\"We should be worse men, and poorer patriots, than you give us credit\r\nfor, or we should be able to make you so,\" said he quietly, \"but this is\r\nno case for ill-temper on either side. The expedition has failed. Well,\r\nif you will not believe _me_, read that. There, in that paper, you will\r\nsee the official account of General Humbert's surrender at Boyle. The\r\nnews is already over the length and breadth of the island; even if you\r\nonly landed last night, I can not conceive how you should be ignorant of\r\nit!\" I covered my face with my hands to hide my emotion; and he went on:\r\n\"If you be French, you have only to claim and prove your nationality,\r\nand you partake the fortunes of your countrymen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if he be not,\" whispered the other, in a voice which, although low,\r\nI could still detect, \"why should _we_, give him up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Tom, be quiet,\" replied the elder, \"let him plead for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me see the newspaper,\" said I, endeavoring to seem calm and\r\ncollected; and taking it at the place he pointed out, I read the heading\r\nin capitals, \"CAPITULATION OF GENERAL HUMBERT AND HIS WHOLE FORCE.\" I\r\ncould see no more. I could not trace the details of so horrible a\r\ndisaster, nor did I ask to know by what means it occurred. My attitude\r\nand air of apparent occupation, however, deceived the other; and the\r\nelder, supposing that I was engaged in considering the paragraph, said,\r\n\"You'll see the government proclamation on the other side, a general\r\namnesty to all under the rank of officers in the rebel army, who give up\r\ntheir arms within six days. The French to be treated as prisoners of\r\nwar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he too late to regain the fleet,\" whispered the younger.\r\n\r\n\"Of course he is. They are already hull down; besides, who's to assist\r\nhis escape, Tom? You forget the position he stands in.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I do not forget it,\" answered I, \"and you need not be afraid that I\r\nwill seek to compromise you, gentlemen. Tell me where to find the\r\nnearest justice of the peace, and I will go and surrender myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is your wisest and best policy,\" said the elder; \"I am not in the\r\ncommission, but a neighbor of mine is, and lives a few miles off, and if\r\nyou like we'll accompany you to his house.\"\r\n\r\nI accepted the offer, and soon found myself descending the steep path of\r\nthe mountain in perfect good-fellowship with the two strangers. It is\r\nlikely enough, that if they had taken any peculiar pains to obliterate\r\nthe memory of our first meeting, or if they had displayed any\r\nextraordinary efforts of conciliation, that I should be on my guard\r\nagainst them; but their manner, on the contrary, was easy and unaffected\r\nin every respect. They spoke of the expedition sensibly and\r\ndispassionately, and while acknowledging that there were many things\r\nthey would like to see altered in the English rule of Ireland, they were\r\nvery averse from the desire of a foreign intervention to rectify them.\r\n\r\nI avowed to them that we had been grossly deceived. That all the\r\nrepresentations made us, depicted Ireland as a nation of soldiers,\r\nwanting only arms and military stores to rise as a vast army. That the\r\npeasantry were animated by one spirit, and the majority of the gentry\r\nwilling to hazard every thing on the issue of a struggle. Our Killala\r\nexperiences, of which I detailed some, heartily amused them, and it was\r\nin a merry interchange of opinions that we now walked along together.\r\n\r\nA cluster of houses, too small to be called a village, and known as the\r\n\"Cranagh,\" stood in a little nook of the bay; and here they lived. They\r\nwere brothers; and the elder held some small appointment in the revenue,\r\nwhich maintained them as bachelors in this cheap country. In a low\r\nconversation that passed between them, it was agreed that they would\r\ndetain me as their guest for that evening, and on the morrow accompany\r\nme to the magistrate's house, about five miles distant. I was not sorry\r\nto accept their hospitable offer. I longed for a few hours of rest and\r\nrespite before embarking on another sea of troubles. The failure of the\r\nexpedition, and the departure of the fleet, had overwhelmed me with\r\ngrief, and I was in no mood to confront new perils.\r\n\r\nIf my new acquaintances could have read my inmost thoughts, their manner\r\ntoward me could not have displayed more kindness or good-breeding. Not\r\npressing me with questions on subjects where the greatest curiosity\r\nwould have been permissible, they suffered me to tell only so much as I\r\nwished of our late plans; and as if purposely to withdraw my thoughts\r\nfrom the unhappy theme of our defeat, led me to talk of France, and her\r\ncareer in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt was not without surprise that I saw how conversant the newspapers had\r\nmade them with European politics, nor how widely different did events\r\nappear, when viewed from afar off, and by the lights of another and\r\ndifferent nationality Thus all that we were doing on the Continent to\r\npropagate liberal notions, and promote the spread of freedom, seemed to\r\ntheir eyes but the efforts of an ambitious power to crush abroad what\r\nthey had annihilated at home, and extend their own influence in\r\ndisseminating doctrines, all to revert, one day or other, to some grand\r\ndespotism, whenever the man arose capable to exercise it. The elder\r\nwould not even concede to us that we were fit for freedom.\r\n\r\n\"You are glorious fellows at destroying an old edifice,\" said he; \"but\r\nsorry architects when comes the question of rebuilding; and as to\r\nliberty, your highest notion of it is an occasional anarchy. Like\r\nschool-boys, you will bear any tyranny for ten years, to have ten days\r\nof a 'barring out' afterward.\"\r\n\r\nI was not much flattered by these opinions; and what was worse, I could\r\nnot get them out of my head all night afterward. Many things I had never\r\ndoubted about now kept puzzling and confounding me, and I began, for the\r\nfirst time, to know the misery of the struggle between implicit\r\nobedience and conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nSOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES.\r\n\r\nI went to bed at night in all apparent health; save from the flurry and\r\nexcitement of an anxious mind, I was in no respect different from my\r\nusual mood; and yet when I awoke next morning, my head was distracted\r\nwith a racking pain, cramps were in all my limbs, and I could not turn\r\nor even move without intense suffering. The long exposure to rain, while\r\nmy mind was in a condition of extreme excitement, had brought on an\r\nattack of fever, and before evening set in, I was raving in wild\r\ndelirium. Every scene I had passed through, each eventful incident of\r\nmy life, came flashing in disjointed portions through my poor brain; and\r\nI raved away of France, of Germany, of the dreadful days of terror, and\r\nthe fearful orgies of the \"Revolution.\" Scenes of strife and\r\nstruggle--the terrible conflicts of the streets--all rose before me; and\r\nthe names of every blood-stained hero of France now mingled with the\r\nobscure titles of Irish insurrection.\r\n\r\nWhat narratives of my early life I may have given--what stories I may\r\nhave revealed of my strange career, I can not tell; but the interest my\r\nkind hosts took in me grew stronger every day. There was no care nor\r\nkindness they did not lavish on me. Taking alternate nights to sit up\r\nwith me, they watched beside my bed, like brothers. All that affection\r\ncould give they rendered me; and even from their narrow fortunes they\r\npaid a physician, who came from a distant town to visit me. When I was\r\nsufficiently recovered to leave my bed, and sit at the window, or stroll\r\nslowly in the garden, I became aware of the full extent to which their\r\nkindness had carried them, and in the precautions for secrecy, I saw the\r\nperil to which my presence exposed them. From an excess of delicacy\r\ntoward me, they did not allude to the subject, nor show the slightest\r\nuneasiness about the matter; but day by day some little circumstance\r\nwould occur, some slight and trivial fact reveal the state of anxiety\r\nthey lived in.\r\n\r\nThey were averse, too, from all discussion of late events, and either\r\nanswered my questions vaguely or with a certain reserve; and when I\r\nhinted at my hope of being soon able to appear before a magistrate and\r\nestablish my claim as a French citizen, they replied that the moment was\r\nan unfavorable one; the lenity of the government had latterly been\r\nabused; their gracious intentions misstated and perverted; that, in\r\nfact, a reaction toward severity had occurred, and military law and\r\ncourts-martial were summarily disposing of cases that a short time back\r\nwould have received the mildest sentences of civil tribunals. It was\r\nclear, from all they said, that if the rebellion was suppressed, the\r\ninsurrectionary feeling was not extinguished, and that England was the\r\nvery reverse of tranquil on the subject of Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt was to no purpose that I repeated my personal indifference to all\r\nthese measures of severity; that in my capacity as a Frenchman and an\r\nofficer, I stood exempt from all the consequences they alluded to. Their\r\nreply was, that in times of trouble and alarm things were done which\r\nquieter periods would never have sanctioned, and that indiscreet and\r\nover-zealous men would venture on acts that neither law nor justice\r\ncould substantiate. In fact, they gave me to believe, that such was the\r\nexcitement of the moment, such the embittered vengeance of those whose\r\nfamilies or fortunes had suffered by the rebellion, that no reprisals\r\nwould be thought too heavy, nor any harshness too great, for those who\r\naided the movement.\r\n\r\nWhatever I might have said against the injustice of this proceeding, in\r\nmy secret heart I had to confess that it was only what might have been\r\nexpected, and coming from a country where it was enough to call a man an\r\naristocrat and then cry \"a la lanterne,\" I saw nothing unreasonable in\r\nit all.\r\n\r\nMy friends, advised me, therefore, instead of preferring any formal\r\nclaim to immunity, to take the first occasion of escaping to America,\r\nwhence I could not fail, later on, of returning to France. At first, the\r\ncounsel only irritated me, but by degrees, as I came to think more\r\ncalmly and seriously of the difficulties, I began to regard it in a\r\ndifferent light; and at last I fully concurred in the wisdom of the\r\nadvice, and resolved on adopting it.\r\n\r\nTo sit on the cliffs, and watch the ocean for hours, became now the\r\npractice of my life--to gaze from daybreak almost to the falling of\r\nnight over the wide expanse of sea, straining my eyes at each sail, and\r\nconjecturing to what distant shore they were tending. The hopes which at\r\nfirst sustained, at last deserted me, as week after week passed over,\r\nand no prospect of escape appeared. The life of inactivity gradually\r\ndepressed my spirits, and I fell into a low and moping condition, in\r\nwhich my hours rolled over without thought or notice. Still, I returned\r\neach day to my accustomed spot, a lofty peak of rock that stood over the\r\nsea, and from which the view extended for miles on every side. There,\r\nhalf hid in the wild heath, I used to lie for hours long, my eyes bent\r\nupon the sea, but my thoughts wandering away to a past that never was to\r\nbe renewed, and a future I was never destined to experience.\r\n\r\nAlthough late in the autumn, the season was mild and genial, and the sea\r\ncalm and waveless, save along the shore, where, even in the stillest\r\nweather, the great breakers come tumbling in with a force, independent\r\nof storm, and listening to their booming thunder, I have dreamed away\r\nhour after hour unconsciously. It was one day, as I lay thus, that my\r\nattention was caught by the sight of three large vessels on the very\r\nverge of the horizon. Habit had now given me a certain acuteness, and I\r\ncould perceive from their height and size that they were ships of war.\r\nFor a while they seemed as if steering for the entrance of the \"lough,\"\r\nbut afterward they changed their course, and headed toward the west. At\r\nlength they separated, and one of smaller size, and probably a frigate\r\nfrom her speed, shot forward beyond the rest, and, in less than half an\r\nhour, disappeared from view. The other two gradually sunk beneath the\r\nhorizon, and not a sail was to be seen over the wide expanse. While\r\nspeculating on what errand the squadron might be employed, I thought I\r\ncould hear the deep and rolling sound of distant cannonading. My ear was\r\ntoo practiced in the thundering crash of the breakers along shore to\r\nconfound the noises; and as I listened I fancied that I could\r\ndistinguish the sound of single guns from the louder roar of a whole\r\nbroadside. This could not mean saluting, nor was it likely to be a mere\r\nexercise of the fleet. They were not times when much powder was expended\r\nunprofitably. Was it then an engagement? But with what or whom? Tandy's\r\nexpedition, as it was called, had long since sailed, and must ere this\r\nhave been captured or safe in France. I tried a hundred conjectures to\r\nexplain the mystery, which now, from the long continuance of the sounds,\r\nseemed to denote a desperately contested engagement. It was not 'till\r\nafter three hours that the cannonading ceased, and then I could descry a\r\nthick dark canopy of smoke that hung hazily over one spot in the\r\nhorizon, as if marking out the scene of the struggle. With what aching,\r\ntorturing anxiety I burned to know what had happened, and with which\r\nside rested the victory.\r\n\r\nWell habituated to hear of the English as victors in every naval\r\nengagement, I yet went on hoping against hope itself, that Fortune might\r\nfor once have favored us; nor was it till the falling night prevented my\r\nbeing able to trace out distant objects, that I could leave the spot and\r\nturn homeward. With wishes so directly opposed to theirs, I did not\r\nventure to tell my two friends what I had witnessed, nor trust myself to\r\nspeak on a subject where my feelings might have betrayed me into\r\nunseemly expressions of my hopes. I was glad to find that they knew\r\nnothing of the matter, and talked away indifferently of other subjects.\r\nBy daybreak, the next morning, I was at my post, a sharp nor'wester\r\nblowing, and a heavy sea rolling in from the Atlantic. Instinctively\r\ncarrying my eyes to the spot where I had heard the cannonnade, I could\r\ndistinctly see the tops of spars, as if the upper rigging of some\r\nvessels, beyond the horizon. Gradually they rose higher and higher, till\r\nI could detect the yard-arms and cross-trees, and finally the great\r\nhulls of five vessels that were bearing toward me.\r\n\r\nFor above an hour I could see their every movement, as with all canvas\r\nspread they held on majestically toward the land, when at length a lofty\r\npromontory of the bay intervened, and they were lost to my view. I\r\njumped to my legs at once, and set off down the cliff to reach the\r\nheadland, from whence an uninterrupted prospect extended. The distance\r\nwas greater than I had supposed, and in my eagerness to take a direct\r\nline to it, I got entangled in difficult gorges among the hills, and\r\nimpeded by mountain torrents which often compelled me to go back a\r\nconsiderable distance; it was already late in the afternoon as I gained\r\nthe crest of a ridge over the Bay of Lough Swilly. Beneath me lay the\r\ncalm surface of the lough, landlocked and still; but further out,\r\nseaward, there was a sight that made my very limbs tremble, and sickened\r\nmy heart as I beheld it. There was a large frigate, that, with\r\nstudding-sails set, stood boldly up the bay, followed by a dismasted\r\nthree-decker, at whose mizen floated the ensign of England over the\r\nFrench \"tri-color.\" Several other vessels were grouped about the offing,\r\nall of them displaying English colors.\r\n\r\nThe dreadful secret was out. There had been a tremendous sea fight, and\r\nthe Hoche, of seventy-four guns, was the sad spectacle which, with\r\nshattered sides and ragged rigging, I now beheld entering the Bay. Oh,\r\nthe humiliation of that sight! I can never forget it. And although on\r\nall the surrounding hills scarcely fifty country people were assembled,\r\nI felt as if the whole of Europe were spectators of our defeat. The flag\r\nI had always believed triumphant now hung ignominiously beneath the\r\nensign of the enemy, and the decks of our noble ship were crowded with\r\nthe uniforms of English sailors and marines.\r\n\r\nThe blue water surged and spouted from the shot holes as the great hull\r\nloomed heavily from side to side, and broken spars and ropes still hung\r\nover the side as she went, a perfect picture of defeat. Never was\r\ndisaster more legibly written. I watched her till the anchor dropped,\r\nand then, in a burst of emotion, I turned away, unable to endure more.\r\nAs I hastened homeward I met the elder of my two hosts coming to meet\r\nme, in considerable anxiety. He had heard of the capture of the Hoche,\r\nbut his mind was far more intent on another and less important event.\r\nTwo men had just been at his cottage with a warrant for my arrest. The\r\ndocument bore my name and rank, as well as a description of my\r\nappearance, and significantly alleged, that although Irish by birth, I\r\naffected a foreign accent for the sake of concealment.\r\n\r\n\"There is no chance of escape now,\" said my friend; \"we are surrounded\r\nwith spies on every hand. My advice is, therefore, to hasten to Lord\r\nCavan's quarters--he is now at Letterkenny--and give yourself up as a\r\nprisoner. There is at least the chance of your being treated like the\r\nrest of your countrymen. I have already provided you with a horse and a\r\nguide, for I must not accompany you myself. Go, then, Maurice. We shall\r\nnever see each other again; but we'll not forget you, nor do we fear\r\nthat you will forget _us_. My brother could not trust himself to take\r\nleave of you, but his best wishes and prayers go with you.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the last words my kind-hearted friend spoke to me; nor do I\r\nknow what reply I made, as, overcome by emotion, my voice became thick\r\nand broken. I wanted to tell all my gratitude, and yet could say\r\nnothing. To this hour I know not with what impression of me he went\r\naway. I can only assert, that, in all the long career of vicissitudes of\r\na troubled and adventurous life, these brothers have occupied the chosen\r\nspot of my affection, for every thing that was disinterested in kindness\r\nand generous in good feeling.\r\n\r\nThey have done more, for they have often reconciled me to a world of\r\nharsh injustice and illiberality, by remembering that two such\r\nexceptions existed, and that others may have experienced what fell to\r\n_my_ lot.\r\n\r\nFor a mile or two my way lay through the mountains, but after reaching\r\nthe high road, I had not proceeded far when I was overtaken by a\r\njaunting-car, on which a gentleman was seated, with his leg supported by\r\na cushion, and bearing all the signs of a severe injury.\r\n\r\n\"Keep the near side of the way, sir, I beg of you,\" cried he; \"I have a\r\nbroken leg, and am excessively uneasy when a horse passes close to me.\"\r\n\r\nI touched my cap in salute, and immediately turned my horse's head to\r\ncomply with his request.\r\n\r\n\"Did you see that, George?\" cried another gentleman, who sat on the\r\nopposite side of the vehicle; \"did you remark that fellow's salute? My\r\nlife on't he's a French soldier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, man--he's the steward of a Clyde smack, or a clerk in a\r\ncounting-house,\" said the first, in a voice which, though purposely low,\r\nmy quick hearing could catch perfectly.\r\n\r\n\"Are we far from Letterkenny just now, sir?\" said the other, addressing\r\nme.\r\n\r\n\"I believe about five miles,\" said I, with a prodigious effort to make\r\nmy pronunciation pass muster.\r\n\r\n\"You're a stranger in these parts, I see, sir,\" rejoined he, with a\r\ncunning glance at his friend, while he added, lower, \"Was I right,\r\nHill?\"\r\n\r\nAlthough seeing that all concealment was now hopeless, I was in no wise\r\ndisposed to plead guilty at once, and therefore, with a cut of my\r\nswitch, pushed my beast into a sharp canter to get forward.\r\n\r\nMy friends, however, gave chase, and now the jaunting-car,\r\nnotwithstanding the sufferings of the invalid, was clattering after me\r\nat about nine miles an hour. At first I rather enjoyed the malice of the\r\npenalty their curiosity was costing, but as I remembered that the\r\ninvalid was not the chief offender, I began to feel compunction at the\r\nseverity of the lesson, and drew up to a walk.\r\n\r\nThey at once shortened their pace, and came up beside me.\r\n\r\n\"A clever hack you're riding, sir,\" said the inquisitive man.\r\n\r\n\"Not so bad for an animal of this country,\" said I, superciliously.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, then, what kind of a horse are you accustomed to?\" asked he, half\r\ninsolently.\r\n\r\n\"The Limousin,\" said I, coolly, \"what we always mount in our Hussar\r\nregiments in France.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are a French soldier, then?\" cried he, in evident astonishment\r\nat my frankness.\r\n\r\n\"At your service, sir,\" said I, saluting; \"a Lieutenant of Hussars; and\r\nif you are tormented by any further curiosity concerning me, I may as\r\nwell relieve you by stating that I am proceeding to Lord Cavan's\r\nhead-quarters, to surrender as a prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frank enough, that!\" said he of the broken leg, laughing heartily as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said the other, \"you are, as your countrymen would call\r\nit, '_bien venu_,' for we are bound in that direction ourselves, and\r\nwill be happy to have your company.\"\r\n\r\nOne piece of tact my worldly experience had profoundly impressed upon\r\nme, and that was, the necessity of always assuming an air of easy\r\nunconcern in every circumstance of doubtful issue. There was quite\r\nenough of difficulty in the present case to excite my anxiety, but I\r\nrode along beside the jaunting-car, chatting familiarly with my new\r\nacquaintances, and, I believe, without exhibiting the slightest degree\r\nof uneasiness regarding my own position.\r\n\r\nFrom them I learned so much as they had heard of the late naval\r\nengagement. The report was that Bompard's fleet had fallen in with Sir\r\nJohn Warren's squadron, and having given orders for his fastest sailers\r\nto make the best of their way to France, had, with the Hoche, the Loire,\r\nand the Resolve, given battle to the enemy. These had all been captured,\r\nas well as four others which fled, two alone of the whole succeeding in\r\ntheir escape. I think now that, grievous as these tidings were, there\r\nwas nothing of either boastfulness or insolence in the tone in which\r\nthey were communicated to me. Every praise was accorded to Bompard for\r\nskill and bravery, and the defense was spoken of in terms of generous\r\neulogy. The only trait of acrimony that showed itself in the recital\r\nwas, a regret that a number of Irish rebels should have escaped in the\r\nBiche, one of the smaller frigates; and several emissaries of the\r\npeople, who had been deputed to the admiral, were also alleged to have\r\nbeen on board of that vessel.\r\n\r\n\"You are sorry to have had missed your friend, the priest of Murrah,\"\r\nsaid Hill, jocularly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, by George, that fellow should have graced a gallows if I had been\r\nlucky enough to have taken him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What was his crime, sir?\" asked I, with seeming unconcern.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing more than exciting to rebellion a people with whom he had no\r\ntie of blood or kindred! He was a Frenchman, and devoted himself to the\r\ncause of Ireland, as they call it, from pure sympathy--\"\r\n\r\n\"And a dash of popery,\" broke in Hill.\r\n\r\n\"It's hard to say even that; my own opinion is, that French Jacobinism\r\ncares very little for the pope. Am I right, young gentleman--you don't\r\ngo very often to confession?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should do so less frequently if I were to be subjected to such a\r\nsystem of interrogatory as yours,\" said I, tartly.\r\n\r\nThey both took my impertinent speech in good part, and laughed heartily\r\nat it; and thus, half amicably, half in earnest, we entered the little\r\ntown of Letterkenny, just as night was falling.\r\n\r\n\"If you'll be our guest for this evening, sir,\" said Hill, \"we shall be\r\nhappy to have your company.\"\r\n\r\nI accepted the invitation, and followed them into the inn.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNNAMED SHELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the corner of the boulevard Montmartre, near the angle of the\r\nfaubourg, is situated a magazine of natural history, that continually\r\ndraws around its windows groups of curious idlers. Open the door, walk\r\nin, and, in place of a mere merchant, you will be surprised to encounter\r\nan artist and a scholar. The man is still young, yet he has explored a\r\nportion of Southern Africa; and has joined in formidable chases of\r\nelephants, lions, and all the wild animals of those barbarous regions.\r\nHe has sought his treasures of natural history in Java, Sumatra, Borneo,\r\nChina, and Cochin-China; has visited Batavia, Samarang and Madura; and\r\nreturned to Paris rich in knowledge and collections.\r\n\r\nIt is rarely that you will find him alone. The laboratory of the\r\nboulevard Montmartre is the rendezvous of all the scholars, travelers,\r\nnaturalists, artists, and authors, who bask in the sunshine of\r\ncelebrity. Temming, the old glory, yet with so much youth about him, of\r\nnatural history; Wilson, collector for his brother in the immense\r\nundertaking of completing the museum of Philadelphia; Philippe Rousseau,\r\nwho bestows life and animation on the animals which he paints; Ledieu,\r\nLéon Gozlan, Biard; Delgorgue, the intrepid chaser of elephants;\r\nLagéronière, who was for one instant on the point of becoming the king\r\nof a savage tribe, and of whom Dumas, in his \"Thousand and One\r\nPhantoms,\" has related in so improbable a manner a fabulous episode of\r\nreal adventures; Gray, whom London cites with pride among its\r\nnaturalists; Mitchell, director of the London Zoological Gardens; Henry\r\nMonnier, the sparkling reflection of Molière; Alphonse Karr; Deshayes,\r\nfor whom conchology and the labyrinths of its classifications have no\r\nfurther mysteries; De Lafresnage, chief of ornithologists; Emile\r\nBlanchard, who spends his life in the dissection of living atoms, or\r\nbeings almost microscopical; Delamarre-Piquot, who travels from one\r\nworld to another, to gather the alimentary substances with which he\r\nwishes to endow Europe; M. Michelin, who consecrates his rare holidays\r\nto an unrivaled collection of polypi; there they are to be found, every\r\nday, studying, admiring, copying, describing, all the strange animals\r\nthat come from every quarter of the globe to this little corner of the\r\nboulevard Montmartre, thence to be distributed among the collections of\r\nEurope and America.\r\n\r\nThere may one listen to sallies of fancy, scientific discussion,\r\nepisodes of likely and unlikely adventures, tales that make one burst\r\nwith laughter, histories that fill the eyes with tears, real dramas that\r\nfreeze the soul with horror, and of which the historian is almost always\r\nthe hero. In the midst of all this noise of conversation and going and\r\ncoming, the master of the establishment loses not a moment. He issues\r\norders, he lends a helping hand; he classes, describes, and attends to\r\nstrangers: and occasionally sends as presents to other museums\r\nunparalleled treasures of natural history. Just let us mention, _en\r\npassant_, that the museum of Paris has been loaded for twenty years back\r\nwith his precious gifts. At each step you take in the galleries, you may\r\nread his name inscribed upon numerous objects, before which the curious\r\nin such matters stop with surprise, and the learned with admiration.\r\n\r\nOne evening, he was laboring with his usual feverish activity to form\r\ncollections of shells, according to their species, and after the method\r\nof Lamarck; for to popularize science is his fervent desire and constant\r\naim. These collections would not nearly reimburse him for the trouble\r\nand cost bestowed upon them; but they would create a few conchologists\r\nthe more; they would facilitate the studies of those who had already\r\ncommenced their initiation into the marvels of a science so attractive,\r\nby the beautiful objects to which it consecrates itself, and this was\r\nwhat the enthusiastic _savant_ wished above all.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said one of the visitors, taking up a shell, \"I never see a\r\nspiral, without calling to mind a drama that was once enacted here, and\r\nwhich I will relate to you:\r\n\r\n\"It was eight or ten years ago, one evening, as it might be to-day. The\r\nsmoke from five or six cigars filled the laboratory with its fantastic\r\nrings. A lamp, vailed under a semi-opaque shade, served only to render\r\nmore visible the shadows of this strange chamber. Here and there, the\r\nglow from the hearth illuminated animals from all parts of the world,\r\nhung at random upon the walls, which they confusedly burdened. The\r\nmaster of the magazine took up a shell which chance placed under his\r\nhand, and presented it to a tall man, hoary with age, who was silently\r\nseated, according to his custom, a little on one side. The stranger\r\napproached the lamp, looked at the shell, smiled, sighed, and placed it\r\nin his pocket. A light crash was heard; he re-seated himself, and\r\nrevived the fire of his half-extinguished cigar. Then, perceiving that\r\nevery one was looking curiously at him--'I have broken it,' said he; and\r\nhe threw the fragments of the shell upon the floor, and ground them\r\nbeneath his heel.\r\n\r\n\"For several instants there was a profound silence, caused by the\r\nsurprise of the company at this gratuitous destruction. The old man\r\ncontinued, with a melancholy smile, 'I will tell you, gentlemen,\r\nwherefore I broke the shell. Science, or rather its fanaticism, leads to\r\nstrange weaknesses. If my folly can any where find indulgence, surely it\r\nwill be among you, who are all, more or less, collectors. Perhaps, I\r\nshall even meet with some auditor not only capable of comprehending, but\r\nlikewise of imitating me. This shell is a spiral that has never been\r\neither named or copied. I possess in my collection the only similar one\r\nthat is known to the scientific world. I procured it, ten years ago,\r\nfrom this magazine. The first time that I saw this unique shell, my\r\nheart beat with joy,' continued the old man, with a voice that had\r\nregained all the energy of youth. 'I was poor, but I must have it at\r\nwhatever price. I carried it home with me, and passed entire days in\r\ncontemplating it, and examining its minutest details. Two years were\r\nnecessary to make up its price--two entire years of privation. Each\r\nmonth, I carried the dealer small sums, often spared from my most\r\npressing necessities. What mattered it? I possessed the shell; it was\r\nmine alone; no one could show me its like. I would not permit any one to\r\ndescribe it. When, on rare occasions, I displayed it to some initiated\r\nones, it was upon the condition that they would not speak of it in their\r\nfaunas. A lover madly enamored, is not more jealous than I then was,\r\nthan I still am, of this treasure. When the two years of which I have\r\nspoken had elapsed, and I had paid the price of my dear spiral, I came\r\nhere one evening as usual. On opening, according to my custom, one of\r\nthe boxes that contain the shells, I uttered a cry. I had found another\r\nspiral similar to that which I possessed! Judge of my sorrow, of my\r\ndespair. My shell was no longer unique. Another collection possessed a\r\ntreasure similar to mine. A cold sweat bathed my forehead. Though very\r\npoor, though I had resigned the little employment which I had held in an\r\noffice, and my humble allowance was transformed into a pension more\r\nhumble still, I hesitated not. I bought the shell, and carried it with\r\nme, but this time without joy. I possessed several good pictures, dear\r\nand old heirlooms belonging to my family. I sold them to pay for the\r\nshell, which I broke as soon as I had made up the price. Three years\r\nmore elapsed, and poverty weighed down my old age more and more. The\r\nfailure of a bank had deprived me of a little sum of money, the interest\r\nof which, added to my pension, had enabled me to live, and to augment,\r\nfrom time to time, my collection of a few good shells. Deprived of this\r\nenjoyment, the only one that remained to me, I had no consolation but in\r\nthe possession of the treasure-hoard which I could no longer increase.\r\nMy precious spiral often detained me before it for hours. One evening\r\n(never shall I forget, the sorrow the sight cost me), I beheld\r\nhere--there--in that box--three spirals like mine! Maledictions hovered\r\nabout my lips. I took the shells in my fingers, I slowly examined them,\r\nand returned them to my friend. 'I can not buy them,' I said. He raised\r\nhis eyes, he saw my palor and my tears--my tears, gentlemen, for I wept!\r\nHe smiled, took a hammer, and pulverized the three precious shells. You\r\nsaw what he did just now. God bless him for his disinterestedness, and\r\nhis devotion to an old friend! I should die of despair, gentlemen, if,\r\nduring my life, another possessed a spiral like mine.'\r\n\r\n\"Speaking thus, the old man rose, and left us, enveloping himself, as\r\nwell as he could, in his fragmentary cloak.\"\r\n\r\nOne morning, three or four years ago, God separated the fanatic\r\nconchologist from the collection that was his life. They found the aged\r\nman seated before his cabinet, opposite to his unique spiral. He had\r\ndied alone, with his eyes fixed upon that which had possessed his\r\naffections during so many years. His collection has now reverted to the\r\nfriend who showed so much sympathy with his jealousy and insensate\r\npassion.\r\n\r\nBy a strange caprice of fortune, no other spiral similar to his has\r\nsince arrived in Europe. It still remains unique and nameless, as when\r\nhe possessed it. For the rest, this spiral, which occupied so large a\r\nplace in the existence and affections of a scientific man, has, for a\r\ncommon eye, nothing in its appearance to justify the intense passion\r\nthat it inspired. Its rarity constitutes its value. One of our most\r\nlearned conchologists is now engaged, in describing, classing, and\r\npublishing a drawing of it. We hope that, in memory of its first\r\npossessor, he will give it the name of _l'hélice innominata_, the\r\n\"nameless spiral.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF GIOVANNI BELZONI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day in the beginning of the year 1803, Mr. Salt, whose name has\r\nsince become so celebrated among the discoverers of Egyptian\r\nantiquities, observed before one of the public rooms of Edinburgh, a\r\ngreat crowd assembled. For almost every one there exists a mysterious\r\nattraction in the sight of a number of people, and Mr. Salt, no wiser\r\nthan his neighbors, pushed his way, when the doors were opened, into the\r\nroom. There, on a sort of stage, he saw a tall and powerfully-built\r\nyoung man, performing various gymnastic exercises, and feats of\r\nstrength. While this Hercules in tinsel was lifting enormous weights,\r\nand jumping from a table over the heads of twelve men, a pretty,\r\ndelicate-looking young woman, was arranging some hydraulic machines and\r\nmusical glasses, with which the entertainment was to terminate. As the\r\nprice of admission was nominal, she occasionally also handed round a\r\nsmall wooden bowl, in order to collect gratuities from the spectators.\r\n\r\nVery few of those who were enjoying the exhibition gave any thing; and\r\nwhen the young woman approached her husband, and showed him the few\r\ncoins she had received, he hastened to terminate his performance. Mr.\r\nSalt pitied the poor fellow, and as the young woman was passing, said to\r\nher:\r\n\r\n\"You forgot to present your bowl for my contribution. Here it is.\"\r\n\r\nHe slipped a silver coin into her hand. Both she and her husband thanked\r\nhim warmly; the latter in broken English, and with an Italian accent.\r\n\r\nMr. Salt, who had but just returned from Rome, replied in Italian; and,\r\nperceiving in the stranger's manner of expressing himself a degree of\r\nrefinement not to be expected from a mountebank, asked him whence he\r\ncame, and what was his history?\r\n\r\n\"Six months ago, sir,\" replied the man, \"if any man had told me that I\r\nshould be reduced to earn my bread by exhibiting my strength in public,\r\nI should have felt greatly inclined to knock him down. I came to England\r\nfor the purpose of making known some hydraulic machines of my invention;\r\nbut the spirit of routine, and the love of ignorance, closed every\r\navenue against me. Previously, before losing all my hopes of success, I\r\nmarried this young girl. Had I been alone in the world, I verily believe\r\nthat the bitter destruction of my expectations would have rendered me\r\ncareless of supporting life; but how could I leave _her_ in misery?\"\r\n\r\n\"But why not try to display your really extraordinary strength and\r\ndexterity under more favorable circumstances? Why do you not offer your\r\nservices to some theatrical manager?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hungry people, sir, can not wait. I did not think of resorting to this\r\nmethod of earning a piece of bread, until I saw my wife ready to perish\r\nfor the want of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe kind Mr. Salt not only relieved his immediate wants, but offered to\r\nrecommend him and his wife to the manager of Astley's Circus, in London.\r\nGratefully and eagerly did the wanderers accept this offer; and while,\r\nin company with their benefactor, who paid for their places on the\r\ncoach, they journeyed toward town, the man related his history. Born at\r\nPadua, the son of a poor barber, and one of fourteen children, Giovanni\r\nBattista Belzoni felt from his earliest youth a longing desire to visit\r\nforeign lands. This \"truant disposition\" was fostered, if not caused, by\r\nthe stories of maritime adventures told him by an old sailor; who was\r\nstrongly suspected of having, during many years, practiced the\r\nprofession of a pirate.\r\n\r\nThe reading, or rather devouring, of a translated copy of \"Robinson\r\nCrusoe\" (and it is a most remarkable circumstance that the book which\r\nhas for its avowed purpose the disheartening of restless adventurers,\r\nshould have made wanderers and voyagers innumerable), gave form and\r\nfixedness to his purpose of rambling; and, in company with his youngest\r\nbrother, the boy set out one fine morning, without any intention but the\r\nsomewhat vague one of \"traveling to seek their fortune.\" The young\r\nfugitives walked several miles, without knowing, in the least, whither\r\nthey were going, when a peddler, who was riding slowly by in a cart,\r\naccosted them, and asked if they were going to Ferrara. Belzoni,\r\nalthough he never heard the name before, immediately answered in the\r\naffirmative. The good-natured merchant, pleased with the countenances,\r\nand pitying the tired looks of the children, not only gave them a place\r\nin his vehicle, but shared with them his luncheon of bread, cheese, and\r\nfruit. That night they occupied part of their companion's lodging; but\r\nnext day, as his business required him to stop at the village where they\r\nslept, the two boys took leave of him, and pursued their journey. Their\r\nnext adventure was not so fortunate. Meeting an empty return carriage,\r\nthey asked the _vetturino_ to give them a ride; and he consenting, they\r\njoyfully got in. Arrived at Ferrara, the _vetturino_ asked them for\r\nmoney. Giovanni, astonished, replied that they had none; and the\r\nunfeeling man stripped the poor children of their upper garments,\r\nleaving them half-naked and penniless in the streets of an unknown city.\r\nGiovanni's undaunted spirit would have led him still to persevere in the\r\nwild-goose chase which had lured him from his home; but his brother\r\nAntonio wept, and complained so loudly, that he was fain to console the\r\nchild by consenting to retrace their steps to Padua. That night, clasped\r\nin each other's arms, they slept beneath a doorway, and the next morning\r\nset out for their native city, begging their food on the journey.\r\n\r\nThe severe chastisement which Giovanni, as the instigator of this\r\nescapade, received on his return, did not in anywise cure his love of\r\nrambling. He submitted, however, to learn his father's trade, and at the\r\nage of eighteen, armed with shaving and hair-cutting implements, he set\r\nout for Rome, and there exercised the occupation of a barber with\r\nsuccess. After some time, he became deeply attached to a girl who, after\r\nencouraging his addresses, deserted him and married a wealthy rival.\r\nThis disappointment preyed so deeply on Belzoni, that, renouncing at the\r\nsame time love and the razor, the world and the brazen bowl of suds, he\r\nentered a convent, and became a Capuchin. The leisure of the cloister\r\nwas employed by him in the study of hydraulics; and he was busy in\r\nconstructing an Artesian well within the monastic precincts when the\r\nFrench army under Napoleon took possession of Rome. The monks of every\r\norder were expelled and dispersed; and our poor Capuchin, obliged to cut\r\nhis own beard, purchased once more the implements of his despised\r\ncalling, and traveled into Holland, the head-quarters of hydraulics,\r\nwhich were still his passion. The Dutch did not encourage him, and he\r\ncame to this country. Here he met his future wife, and consoled himself\r\nfor his past misfortunes by marrying one who proved, through weal and\r\nwoe, a fond and faithful partner. The crude hydraulic inventions of a\r\nwandering Italian were as little heeded here, as on the Continent; and\r\nwe have already seen the expedient to which Belzoni was obliged to have\r\nrecourse when Mr. Salt met him in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nHaving reached London, the kind antiquary introduced his _protégés_ to\r\nthe manager of Astley's. The practiced eye of the renowned equestrian\r\nimmediately appreciated at their value the beauty and athletic vigor of\r\nthe Paduan Goliath; and he engaged both him and his wife at a liberal\r\nsalary. He caused a piece, entitled \"The Twelve Labors of Hercules\" to\r\nbe arranged expressly for his new performers; and Mr. Salt had soon\r\nafterward the satisfaction of seeing Giovanni Belzoni appear on the\r\nstage, carrying twelve men on his arms and shoulders, while madame, in\r\nthe costume of Cupid, stood at the top, as the apex of a pyramid, and\r\nwaved a tiny crimson flag.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, Mr. Salt went to Egypt as consul, and there became\r\nacquainted with Signor Drouetti. The two friends, equally enthusiastic\r\non the subject of Egyptian antiquities, set to work to prosecute\r\nresearches, with an ardor of rivalship which approached somewhat too\r\nnearly to jealousy. Each aspired to undertake the boldest expeditions,\r\nand to attempt the most hazardous excavations. But the great object of\r\ntheir ambition was an enormous bust of Memnon, in rose-colored granite,\r\nwhich lay half buried in the sand on the left bank of the Nile.\r\n\r\nSignor Drouetti had failed in all his attempts to raise it, nor was Mr.\r\nSalt a whit more successful. One day, while the latter was thinking what\r\na pity it was that such a precious monument should be left to perish by\r\ndecay, a stranger asked to speak with him. Mr. Salt desired him to be\r\nadmitted; and immediately, despite his visitor's Oriental garb and long\r\nbeard, he recognized the Hercules of Astley's.\r\n\r\n\"What has brought you to Egypt?\" asked the astonished consul.\r\n\r\n\"You shall hear, sir,\" replied the Italian. \"After having completed my\r\nengagement in London, I set out for Lisbon, where I was employed by the\r\nmanager of the theatre of San Carlo to perform the part of Samson, in a\r\nscriptural piece which had been arranged expressly for me. From thence I\r\nwent to Madrid, where I appeared with applause in the theatre Della\r\nPuerta del Sol. After having collected a tolerable sum of money, I\r\nresolved to come here. My first object is to induce the Pasha to adopt\r\nan hydraulic machine for raising the waters of the Nile.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Salt then explained his wishes respecting the antiquities; but\r\nBelzoni, could not, he said, enter upon that till he had carried out his\r\nscheme of water-works.\r\n\r\nHe was accompanied, he said in continuation, by Mrs. Belzoni, and by an\r\nIrish lad of the name of James Curtain; and had reached Alexandria just\r\nas the plague was beginning to disappear from that city, as it always\r\ndoes on the approach of St. John's day, when, as almost every body\r\nknows, \"out of respect for the saint,\" it entirely ceases. The state of\r\nthe country was still very alarming, yet Mr. Belzoni and his little\r\nparty ventured to land, and performed quarantine in the French quarter;\r\nwhere, though really very unwell, they were wise enough to disguise\r\ntheir situation; \"for the plague is so dreadful a scourge,\" he observed,\r\n\"and operates so powerfully on human fears and human prejudices, that,\r\nduring its prevalence, if a man be ill, he must be ill of the plague,\r\nand if he die, he must have died of the plague.\"\r\n\r\nBelzoni went straight to Cairo, where he was well received by Mr.\r\nBaghos, interpreter to Mohammed Ali, to whom Mr. Salt recommended him.\r\nMr. Baghos immediately prepared to introduce him to the Pasha, that he\r\nmight come to some arrangement respecting the hydraulic machine, which\r\nhe proposed to construct for watering the gardens of the seraglio. As\r\nthey were proceeding toward the palace, through one of the principal\r\nstreets of Cairo, a fanatical Mussulman struck Mr. Belzoni so fiercely\r\non the leg with his staff, that it tore away a large piece of flesh. The\r\nblow was severe, and the discharge of blood copious, and he was obliged\r\nto be conveyed home, where he remained under cure thirty days before he\r\ncould support himself on the wounded leg. When able to leave the house,\r\nhe was presented to the Pasha, who received him very civilly; but on\r\nbeing told of the misfortune which had happened to him, contented\r\nhimself with coolly observing \"that such accidents could not be avoided\r\nwhere there were troops.\"\r\n\r\nAn arrangement was immediately concluded for erecting a machine which\r\nwas to raise as much water with one ox as the ordinary ones do with\r\nfour. Mr. Belzoni soon found, however, that he had many prejudices to\r\nencounter, and many obstacles to overcome, on the part of those who were\r\nemployed in the construction of the work, as well as of those who owned\r\nthe cattle engaged in drawing water for the Pasha's gardens. The fate of\r\na machine which had been sent from England taught him to augur no good\r\nfor that which he had undertaken to construct. Though of the most costly\r\ndescription, and every way equal to perform what it was calculated to\r\ndo, it had failed to answer the unreasonable expectations of the\r\nTurks--because \"the quantity of water raised by it was not sufficient to\r\ninundate the whole country in an hour!--which was their measure of the\r\npower of an English water-wheel.\"\r\n\r\nWhen that of Belzoni was completed, the Pasha proceeded to the gardens\r\nof Soubra to witness its effect. The machine was set to work, and,\r\nalthough constructed of bad materials, and of unskillful workmanship,\r\nits powers were greater than had been contracted for; yet the Arabs,\r\nfrom interested motives, declared against it. The Pasha, however, though\r\nevidently disappointed, admitted that it was equal to four of the\r\nordinary kind, and, consequently, accorded with the agreement.\r\nUnluckily, he took it into his head to have the oxen removed, and, \"by\r\nway of frolic,\" to see what effect could be produced by putting fifteen\r\nmen into the wheel. The Irish lad got in with them; but no sooner had\r\nthe wheel begun to turn than the Arabs jumped out, leaving the lad alone\r\nin it. The wheel, relieved from its load, flew back with such velocity,\r\nthat poor Curtain was flung out, and in the fall broke one of his\r\nthighs; and, being entangled in the machinery, would, in all\r\nprobability, have lost his life, had not Belzoni applied his prodigious\r\nstrength to the wheel, and stopped it. The accident, however, was fatal\r\nto the project and to the future hopes of the projector.\r\n\r\nAt that time the insolence of the Turkish officers of the Pashalic was\r\nat its height, and the very sight of a \"dog of a Christian\" raised the\r\nire of the more bigoted followers of the Prophet. While at Soubra, which\r\nis close to Cairo, Belzoni had a narrow escape from assassination. He\r\nrelates the adventure in his work on Egypt:\r\n\r\n\"Some particular business calling me to Cairo. I was on my ass in one of\r\nthe narrow streets, where I met a loaded camel. The space that remained\r\nbetween the camel and the wall was so little, that I could scarcely\r\npass; and at that moment I was met by a Binbashi, a subaltern officer,\r\nat the head of his men. For the instant I was the only obstacle that\r\nprevented his proceeding on the road; and I could neither retreat nor\r\nturn round, to give him room to pass. Seeing it was a Frank who stopped\r\nhis way, he gave me a violent blow on my stomach. Not being accustomed\r\nto put up with such salutations, I returned the compliment with my whip\r\nacross his naked shoulders. Instantly he took his pistol out of his\r\nbelt; I jumped off my ass; he retired about two yards, pulled the\r\ntrigger, fired at my head, singed the hair near my right ear, and killed\r\none of his own soldiers, who, by this time, had come behind me. Finding\r\nthat he had missed his aim, he took a second pistol; but his own\r\nsoldiers assailed and disarmed him. A great noise arose in the street,\r\nand, as it happened to be close to the seraglio in the Esbakie, some of\r\nthe guards ran up; but on seeing what the matter was, they interfered\r\nand stopped the Binbashi. I thought my company was not wanted, so I\r\nmounted my charger, and rode off. I went to Mr. Baghos, and told him\r\nwhat had happened. We repaired immediately to the citadel, saw the\r\nPasha, and related the circumstance to him. He was much concerned, and\r\nwished to know where the soldier was, but observed that it was too late\r\nthat evening to have him taken up. However, he was apprehended the next\r\nday, and I never heard or knew any thing more about him. Such a lesson\r\non the subject was not lost upon me; and I took good care, in future,\r\nnot to give the least opportunity of the kind to men of that\r\ndescription, who can murder an European with as much indifference as\r\nthey would kill an insect.\"\r\n\r\nRuined by the loss of all his savings, which he had spent in the\r\nconstruction of his water machines, Belzoni once more applied to Mr.\r\nSalt, and undertook the furtherance of his scheme, to convey to England\r\nthe bust of Memnon. So eager was he, that the same day, the Italian set\r\nout for the ruins of Thebes, and hired a hundred natives, whom he made\r\nclear away the sand which half covered the stone colossus. With a large\r\nstaff in his hand, Belzoni commanded his army of Mussulmans, directed\r\ntheir labors, astonished them with displays of his physical strength,\r\nlearned to speak their language with marvelous facility, and speedily\r\ncame to be regarded by them as a superior being, endowed with magical\r\npower.\r\n\r\nOne day, however, his money failed; and at the same time the rising of\r\nthe Nile destroyed in two hours, the work of three months. The _fellahs_\r\nrebeled: one of them rushed toward Belzoni, intending to strike him with\r\nhis dagger. The Italian coolly waited his approach, disarmed him; and\r\nthen, seizing him by the feet, lifted him as though he had been a hazel\r\nwand, and began to inflict vigorous blows on the other insurgents with\r\nthis novel and extemporary weapon of defense. The lesson was not thrown\r\naway: very speedily the _fellahs_ returned to their duty; and after\r\neighteen days' incessant labor, Memnon trembled at his base, and was\r\nmoved toward the bank of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThe embarkation of this enormous statue presented difficulties almost as\r\ngreat as those which attended its disinterment and land transport.\r\nNevertheless, the intelligence and perseverance of Belzoni surmounted\r\nevery obstacle; and he brought his wondrous conquest to London, where\r\nits arrival produced a sensation similar to that caused more recently in\r\nParis by the sight of the Obelisk of Luxor. Loaded with praise, and also\r\nwith more substantial gifts, Belzoni, now become an important personage,\r\nreturned to Egypt and to his friend Mr. Salt. The latter proposed to him\r\nto go up the Nile, and attempt the removal of the sand-hills which\r\ncovered the principal portion of the magnificent temple of Ebsamboul.\r\nBelzoni readily consented, set out for Lower Nubia, ventured boldly\r\namong the savage tribes who wander through the sandy desert; returning\r\nto Thebes, he was rewarded, not only by the success of his special\r\nmission, but also by discovering the temple of Luxor.\r\n\r\nIn all his undertakings, however enterprising, Belzoni was aided and\r\ncheered by the presence of his wife. The expedition to Nubia was,\r\nhowever, thought too hazardous for her to undertake. But in the absence\r\nof her husband she was not idle; she dug up the statue of Jupiter Ammon,\r\nwith the ram's head on his knee; which is now in the British Museum.\r\n\r\nThe temple of Luxor had been so completely and for so long a period,\r\nburied in sand, that even its existence remained unsuspected. It had\r\nbeen dedicated to Isis by the Queen of Rameses the Great; and the\r\ndescriptions which travelers give of it, resemble those of the palaces\r\nin the \"Arabian Nights.\" Four colossal figures, sixty-one feet in\r\nheight, are seated in front. Eight others, forty-eight in height, and\r\nstanding up, support the roof of the principal inner hall, in which\r\ngigantic bas-reliefs represent the whole history of Rameses. Sixteen\r\nother halls, scarcely smaller than the first, display, in all their\r\nprimitive splendor, many gorgeous paintings, and the mysterious forms of\r\nmyriads of statues.\r\n\r\nAfter this discovery, Belzoni took up his temporary abode in the valley\r\nof _Biban el Mouloch_ (Tombs of the Kings). He had already remarked\r\nthere, among the rocks, a fissure of a peculiar form, and which was\r\nevidently the work of man. He caused this opening to be enlarged, and\r\nsoon discovered the entrance to a long corridor, whose walls were\r\ncovered with sculptures and hieroglyphical paintings. A deep fosse and a\r\nwall barred the further end of the cave; but he broke a passage\r\nthrough, and found a second vault, in which stood an alabaster\r\nsarcophagus, covered with hieroglyphics. He took possession of this and\r\nsent it safely to Europe. His own account of these difficulties is\r\nextremely interesting:\r\n\r\n\"Of some of these tombs many persons could not withstand the suffocating\r\nair, which often causes fainting. A vast quantity of dust rises, so fine\r\nthat it enters the throat and nostrils, and chokes the nose and mouth to\r\nsuch a degree, that it requires great power of lungs to resist it and\r\nthe strong effluvia of the mummies. This is not all; the entry or\r\npassage where the bodies are is roughly cut in the rocks, and the\r\nfalling of the sand from the upper part or ceiling of the passage causes\r\nit to be nearly filled up. In some places there is not more than the\r\nvacancy of a foot left, which you must contrive to pass through in a\r\ncreeping posture, like a snail, on pointed and keen stones, that cut\r\nlike glass. After getting through these passages, some of them two or\r\nthree hundred yards long, you generally find a more commodious place,\r\nperhaps high enough to sit. But what a place of rest! surrounded by\r\nbodies, by heaps of mummies in all directions; which, previous to my\r\nbeing accustomed to the sight, impressed me with horror. The blackness\r\nof the walls, the faint light given by the candles or torches for want\r\nof air, the different objects that surrounded me, seeming to converse\r\nwith each other, and the Arabs, with the candles or torches in their\r\nhands, naked and covered with dust, themselves resembling living\r\nmummies, absolutely formed a scene that can not be described. In such a\r\nsituation I found myself several times, and often returned exhausted and\r\nfainting, till at last I became inured to it, and indifferent to what I\r\nsuffered, except from the dust which never failed to choke my throat and\r\nnose; and though, fortunately, I am destitute of the sense of smelling,\r\nI could taste that the mummies were rather unpleasant to swallow. After\r\nthe exertion of entering into such a place, through a passage of fifty,\r\na hundred, three hundred, or perhaps six hundred yards, nearly overcome,\r\nI sought a resting-place, found one, and contrived to sit; but when my\r\nweight bore on the body of an Egyptian, it crushed it like a band-box. I\r\nnaturally had recourse to my hands to sustain my weight, but they found\r\nno better support; so that I sunk altogether among the broken mummies,\r\nwith a crash of bones, rags, and wooden cases, which raised such a dust\r\nas kept me motionless for a quarter of an hour, waiting till it subsided\r\nagain. I could not remove from the place, however, without increasing\r\nit, and every step I took I crushed a mummy in some part or other. Once\r\nI was conducted from such a place to another resembling it, through a\r\npassage of about twenty feet in length, and no wider than that a body\r\ncould be forced through. It was choked with mummies, and I could not\r\npass without putting my face in contact with that of some decayed\r\nEgyptian; but as the passage inclined downward, my own weight helped me\r\non: however, I could not avoid being covered with bones, legs, arms, and\r\nheads rolling from above. Thus I proceeded from one cave to another, all\r\nfull of mummies piled up in various ways--some standing, some lying, and\r\nsome on their heads.\"\r\n\r\nAfterward, Belzoni traveled to the shores of the Red Sea, inspected the\r\nruins of Berenice; then returned to Cairo, and directed excavations to\r\nbe made at the bases of the great pyramids of Ghizeh; penetrated into\r\nthat of Chephren--which had hitherto been inaccessible to Europeans--and\r\ndiscovered within it the sacred chamber where repose the hallowed bones\r\nof the bull Apis. The Valley of Faioum, the Lake Moeris, the ruins of\r\nArsinoë, the sands of Libya, all yielded up their secrets to his\r\ndauntless spirit of research. He visited the oasis of El-Cassar, and the\r\nFountain of the Sun; strangled in his arms two treacherous guides who\r\ntried to assassinate him; and then left Egypt, and returned to Padua\r\nwith his wife.\r\n\r\nThe son of the humble barber had now become a rich and celebrated\r\npersonage. A triumphal entry was prepared for him; and the municipal\r\nauthorities of his native city met him at the gate, and presented him\r\nwith an address. Manfredini was commissioned to engrave a medal which\r\nshould commemorate the history of the illustrious traveler. England,\r\nhowever, soon claimed him; and on his arrival in London, he was received\r\nwith the same honors as in his own country. Then he published an account\r\nof his travels, under the following title: \"Narrative of the Operations\r\nand recent Discoveries in the Pyramids, Temples, Tombs, and Cities of\r\nEgypt and Nubia, &c.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1822, Belzoni returned to Africa, with the intention of penetrating\r\nto Timbuctoo. Passing in the following year from the Bight of Benin\r\ntoward Houssa, he was attacked with dysentery; was carried back to Gato,\r\nand thence put on board an English vessel lying off the coast. There,\r\nwith much firmness and resignation, he prepared to meet his end. He\r\nintrusted the captain with a large amethyst to be given to his wife, and\r\nalso with a letter which he wrote to his companion through good and evil\r\ndays. Soon afterward, he breathed his last. They buried him at Gato, at\r\nthe foot of a large tree, and engraved on his tomb the following epitaph\r\nin English--\r\n\r\n\"_Here lies Belzoni, who died at this place, on his way to Timbuctoo,\r\nDecember 3d, 1823._\"\r\n\r\nBelzoni was but forty-five years old when he died. A statue of him was\r\nerected at Padua, on the 4th of July, 1827. Very recently, the\r\ngovernment of Great Britain bestowed on his widow the tardy solace of a\r\nsmall pension.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Belzoni, the once starving mountebank, became one of the most\r\nillustrious men in Europe!--an encouraging example to all those who have\r\nnot only sound heads to project, but stout hearts to execute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHANTOMS AND REALITIES.--AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n(_Continued from Page 613._)\r\n\r\nPART THE SECOND--NOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nTo reason upon the effects of the discovery, or confession of our\r\nfeelings, was not a process for which either of us was qualified by\r\ntemperament or inclination. We did not pause to consider whether it was\r\nprudent to take our hearts and natures for granted all at once, and risk\r\nupon the strange delight of a single moment of luxurious emotion the\r\nhappiness, perhaps, of a whole lifetime. We did not stop to ask if there\r\nwere any obstacles in the way, any jarring chords to be attuned, any\r\nthing to be known or thought of into which our position demanded a\r\nscrutiny. We resigned ourselves at once to our impulses. We believed\r\nthat we had seen enough of the world, and were strong enough in our\r\nself-sustaining power, and clear enough in our penetration, to dispense\r\nwith ordinary safeguards, and act as if we were superior to them. We\r\nmade our own world, and so went on as if we could control the planet in\r\nwhich we lived at our own will and pleasure.\r\n\r\nI soon perceived that my attentions to Astræa had become a subject of\r\nmuch remark. The peering coterie about us were so vigilant in matters of\r\nthat kind, that, as it appeared afterward, they had found out the fact\r\nbefore it had taken place. For my own part, there was nobody half so\r\nmuch surprised at the circumstance as I was myself. I believed that the\r\nheart, like that plant which is said to blow once and die, was incapable\r\nof a second growth of love; but I now felt the fallacy of that doctrine,\r\nand was at first humiliated by the discovery. It struck me like a great\r\nheresy against truth and purity; it seemed to lay bare before me the\r\ncorruptibility and feebleness of poor human nature. To strive against\r\nit, however, was idle. The second growth was in full flower, yet with a\r\ndifference from the first, which I could detect even against the grain\r\nof the passion that was subjugating me. I felt that the second growth\r\nwas less simple and devotional than the first; that it had more\r\nexuberance, and was of a wilder character; that it struck not its roots\r\nso deeply, but spread its blossoms more widely; that it was less\r\nengrossing, but more agitating; that it was cultivated with greater\r\nconsciousness and premeditation, risked with more caution, fed with more\r\nprudence, and tended more constantly--but all with a lesser waste of the\r\nimagination; that its delights were more fervid but less appeasing; that\r\nit looked not so much into the future with hope and promise, as it\r\nfilled the present with rapture; that its memories were neither so sad\r\nnor so vivid, and that it let in caprice, and vanity, and\r\nunreasonableness, and self-love, and the world's esteem, which are all\r\nas dust in the balance, or a feather in the whirlwind, to impetuous\r\nlove. I was amazed to find myself a daily waiter upon beauty. Yet so it\r\nwas. The vision of Gertrude was now gone from my path--the spectre had\r\nvanished in the broad light of the new passion.\r\n\r\nStill, while I paid my court to Astræa, it was not with any intention of\r\npublicity, but furtively, as if a private dread hung over us, or as if\r\nwe thought it pleasanter to vail our feelings from observation. We\r\nunderstood each other in silent looks, which we supposed to be\r\nunintelligible to every body else; she seemed to avoid, designedly, all\r\nappearance of interest in me, and sometimes played the part to such\r\nadmiration, as to give me not a few passing pangs of doubt and\r\nuneasiness; and I, seeing how scrupulous she was on that point, and not\r\nchoosing to incur rude jests at her expense, was equally unwilling to\r\nbetray a feeling which was rendered the more delicious by secrecy. We\r\nimagined ourselves secure; but neither of us could have had much worldly\r\nsagacity or we must have known that all our caution was fruitless.\r\nBasilisks' eyes were around us, and we trod a path beset with serpents.\r\nFortunately we were both looked up to as persons who could not be\r\napproached with familiarity; and that preserved us from the open\r\nbadinage to which others, in similar circumstances, might have been\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\nAlone, and liberated from this vexatious surveillance, we gave free vent\r\nto our thoughts. The suddenness of our new confidence, and the rapidity\r\nwith which we already shaped its issues, bewildered us by the intensity\r\nof the emotions that came crowding for speech and explanation. Astræa\r\nsometimes had misgivings, although she never knew how to give them a\r\ndefinite form. One day she said to me, \"We are wrong in giving way to\r\nthis feeling. It is not a love likely to procure us peace. I say this to\r\nyou because I feel it--perhaps, because I know it; but I confess myself\r\nunable to argue upon a question upon which my reason, my whole being is\r\nheld in suspense. I say so, simply because I ought to say so, and not\r\nbecause I am prepared of myself to act, or even to advise. I am like a\r\nleaf in a tempest, and can not guide myself. I yield to the irresistible\r\npower that has swept me from the firm land, and deprived me of the\r\nstrength to regain it.\"\r\n\r\nI fancied that this left me but one course to take, and I replied, \"We\r\nhave pronounced our destiny, Astræa, for good or for evil. We ought to\r\nhave no choice but to abide by it. If you do not fail in your faith,\r\nmine is irrevocable.\"\r\n\r\nAt these words she looked gravely at me, and answered,\r\n\r\n\"My faith dies with me. It is a part of my life. It was not taken up in\r\nan hour, to be as lightly thrown aside. Without it, life would be\r\ninsupportable; with it, life in any shape of seclusion, privation,\r\nbanishment, contains all the blessings I covet upon earth. It was not\r\nfor that, or of that I spoke. Understand me clearly, and put no\r\nconstruction on my words outside their plain and ordinary meaning. All I\r\nask, all that is necessary for me is your society; to hear you speak, to\r\ndrink in the words of kindness and power that flow from your lips, to\r\nbe ever near you, to tend, solace, and console you. I should be content\r\nto enjoy the privilege of seeing that you were happy, without even\r\naspiring to the higher glory of creating happiness for you. That is my\r\nnature--capable of a wider range, and a loftier flight, but happiest in\r\nits devotion. In any capacity I will serve you--and feel that the\r\nservitude of love is dominion!\"\r\n\r\nSo firm and constant was the character of Astræa, tinged with a romantic\r\ninspiration, that all this homage was serious and real, and issued\r\ngravely from her heart through her lips. She meant every syllable she\r\nspoke in its true sense; and I felt that she was ready to fulfill it,\r\nand sustain it to the end. She believed that all endurances were\r\npossible for love's sake, and that she could even enact miracles of\r\nstoicism in the strength of her fidelity.\r\n\r\nFor many months our intercourse, always thus sophisticating its aims and\r\ninterpretations, was carried on in secret. We had become necessary to\r\neach other; but being still shut up in our mystery, we had not made as\r\nmuch advance toward any definite result as one single moment of\r\ndisclosure to the people we were among would have inevitably compelled\r\nus to decide upon. We were very prudent in our outward bearing, and\r\nhardly aware of the avidity with which the concealed passion was\r\ndevouring our hearts.\r\n\r\nThe dwarf followed me, and hovered about me more than ever. But I\r\nlearned to bear with him on account of his being in the house with\r\nAstræa. Any body who was constantly in her society, and admitted to\r\nterms of intimacy with her, was welcome to me--as relics from the altar\r\nof a saint are welcome to the devotee, or a leaf snatched, from a tree\r\nin the haunts of home is welcome to the exile. It was a pleasure when I\r\nmet him even to ask for Astræa, to have an excuse for uttering her name,\r\nor to hear him speak of her, or to speak of her myself, or to talk of\r\nany thing that we had before talked of together. Such are the resources,\r\nthe feints, the stratagems, the foibles of love!\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nOne night my indefatigable Mephistophiles took me to a tavern. He was in\r\na vagrant mood, and I indulged him.\r\n\r\n\"Come, we shall see life to-night,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart,\" I replied. It was not much to my taste, but I\r\nfancied there was something unusual in his manner, and my curiosity was\r\nawakened to see what it would lead to.\r\n\r\nWe entered a bustling and brilliantly-lighted house. Numerous guests\r\nwere scattered about at different tables, variously engaged in getting\r\nrid of time at the smallest possible cost of reflection. The dwarf\r\nsauntered through the room, whispered a waiter, and, beckoning me to\r\nfollow, led the way up-stairs to a lesser apartment, where we found\r\nourselves alone.\r\n\r\n\"You will not see much life here,\" I observed, rather surprised at his\r\nselection of a secluded room in preference to the lively _salon_ through\r\nwhich we had just passed.\r\n\r\n\"We can make our own life,\" he answered, with a sarcastic twinge of the\r\nmouth, \"and imagine more things in five minutes than we should see or\r\nhear below in a month.\"\r\n\r\nI thought this very odd. It looked as if he had some concealed motive;\r\nbut I acquiesced in his notion, and was secretly pleased, not less at\r\nthe exchange of the din and riot for ease and quietness, than at the\r\nopportunity it opened to him for the free play of the humor, whatever it\r\nwas, that I could plainly see was working upon him.\r\n\r\nWe drank freely--that was a great resource with him when he was in a\r\nmood of extravagance--talked rapidly about a chaos of things, laughed\r\nloudly, and in the pauses of the strange revel relapsed every now and\r\nthen into silence and abstraction. During these brief and sudden\r\nintervals, the dwarf would amuse himself by drawing uncouth lines on the\r\ntable, with his head hanging over them, as if his thoughts were\r\nelsewhere engaged, and the unintelligible pastime of his fingers were\r\nresorted to only to hide them.\r\n\r\nI could not tell why it was, but I felt uneasy and restless. My\r\ncompanion appeared to me like a man who was mentally laboring at some\r\nrevelation, yet did not know how to begin it. He was constantly talking\r\nat something that was evidently troubling his mind, yet he still evaded\r\nhis own purpose, as if he did not like the task to which he had set\r\nhimself. Throughout the whole time he never mentioned Astræa's name, and\r\nthis circumstance gave me additional cause for suspicion.\r\n\r\nAt last, summoning up all his energy, and fixing himself with the points\r\nof his elbows on the table, and his long, wiry hands, which looked like\r\ntalons, stretched up into his elfin hair at each side of his face, while\r\nhis eyes, shooting out their malignant fires, were riveted upon me to\r\nscan the effect of what he was about to say, he suddenly exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"You have been remarked in your attentions to Astræa.\"\r\n\r\nThe mystery was out. And what was there in it, after all? I was a free\r\nagent, and so was Astræa. Why should he make so much theatrical parade\r\nabout so very simple a business?\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" I exclaimed, scarcely able to repress a smile, which the\r\nexaggerated earnestness of his manner excited.\r\n\r\n\"Well! You acknowledge that it is so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Acknowledge? Why should I either acknowledge or deny it? There is no\r\ntreason in it; the lady is the best judge--let me add, the only\r\njudge--of any attentions I may have paid to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I say you have been remarked--it has been spoken of--it is already\r\na common topic of conversation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! A common topic of conversation! Well, I have no objection,\r\nprovided my good-natured friends do not say any thing injurious, or\r\nwound the lady's feelings by an improper use of my name.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment, and lowering his voice, then went on,\r\n\r\n\"You never said any thing of this before.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I? The inquiry was never made of me before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have made no inquiry,\" he retorted. \"I didn't ask you to confess. You\r\nhave avowed it all yourself, unconsciously.\"\r\n\r\nI felt that the dwarf was getting serious, and that he was likely to\r\nmake me more in earnest before he was done than I had at first\r\nanticipated. I saw the necessity of showing him at once that I would not\r\nbrook his interference, and I addressed him in a more deliberate tone\r\nthan I had hitherto adopted.\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to ask,\" I demanded, \"what interest you may take in this\r\nmatter, and by what right you assume the office of interrogating me so\r\nauthoritatively?\"\r\n\r\n\"By what right?\" he answered. \"My right to do so is rather clearer than\r\nyour right to refuse an explanation. You met her at my mother's\r\nhouse--you meet her there. She is under our roof, under our guardianship\r\nand protection. That gives me the right. It is not pleasant to interfere\r\nin this way; but I am called upon to do so by my position, and I delayed\r\nit in the hope that you would render it unnecessary.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should you hope so? Why should you desire any explanation on the\r\nsubject? The lady is her own mistress: she is under your roof, it is\r\ntrue; but not under your control. The same thing might happen under any\r\nother roof, and nobody would thereby acquire a right to interfere in a\r\nmatter that concerns her alone. You will surely see the propriety of not\r\nsuffering your curiosity to meddle any further in the affair?\"\r\n\r\n\"Meddle!\" he reiterated; \"control! Are these the phrases with which you\r\ntaunt me? But,\" dropping his voice again, he added, \"you are right in\r\nsuggesting that I have discharged my office when I demand, to what end\r\nthose very marked attentions are paid to Astræa?\"\r\n\r\n\"You make an unwarrantable demand, and you shall have a fitting answer\r\nto it; and my answer is, that to Astræa alone will I confide my\r\nconfession, as you call it. She is old enough and wise enough to think\r\nand act for herself; nor will I consent to compromise my respect for her\r\nunderstanding by admitting that she requires an arbitrator--perhaps I\r\nought to say, champion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have a care,\" he replied, kindling up all at once into a sort of\r\nfrenzy--\"have a care what you say or do. You move in darkness--you tread\r\non smothered fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you threaten me?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"No; I do not threaten you. Look at your arm and mine--compare your\r\nmuscles with my shrunken and stunted frame,\" he cried, with an\r\nexpression of pain and bitterness; \"I do not threaten you, but I warn\r\nyou--mark me, I warn you! Heed my warning, I beseech, I implore\r\nyou--nay, heed it for your life!\"\r\n\r\nI could not but admire the sibyl-like grandeur of his head and\r\noutstretched arms as he uttered these strange words. His voice was\r\nhoarse with some surging emotion; and if so poor a creature could have\r\nbeen the recipient of a supernatural inspiration, he might have sat at\r\nthat moment for the portrait of one of the deformed soothsayers in a\r\ntale of magic.\r\n\r\n\"Do I understand you correctly?\" said I; \"or are you only playing off\r\nsome new freak upon me? Answer me frankly one question, and I shall be\r\nbetter able to comprehend the meaning of your mysterious menace. Are\r\nyou--but I know it is absurd, I feel that the question is very\r\nridiculous, only that your reply to it will, perhaps, set us both\r\nright--do you love Astræa? I really can not conceive any thing short of\r\nsome such feeling to justify this violence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Love her? _I_ love _Astræa?_ If there be a mortal I hate in the core of\r\nmy heart, it is Astræa. Are you satisfied?\" he replied, with an\r\nexpression of fiendish satisfaction in his face, as if he were glad of\r\nthe excuse for giving vent to his malignity.\r\n\r\n\"Hate her?\" said I, calmly; \"that is unreasonable: but the whole\r\ndiscussion is unreasonable. I have given you my answer; none other shall\r\nyou have from me. So, good-night.\"\r\n\r\n\"One word,\" he said, leaping out of his chair into the middle of the\r\nroom. \"One word before you go. I am a dwarf--do not delude yourself into\r\nany contempt of me on that account. I know as well as you do my\r\ndisadvantages in the world; I am as conscious as you are of my physical\r\ndefects and shortcomings, my distorted spine, and the parsimony of\r\nnature in all particulars when she made me. But I have passions like\r\nother men; and I pursue them like other men, only, as I am shut out from\r\nthe summary and open process, I am compelled, perchance, to the choice\r\nof dark and crooked means. Perhaps, too, my passions are all the more\r\nturbulent and dangerous because they are pent up in an incapable frame,\r\nand denied the vents and appliances which men like you have at their\r\ncommand. Mark me! see Astræa no more. Let your last interview with her\r\nbe your last forever. Enter our house no more; that interdict, at least,\r\nI have a right to pronounce. But for myself, and from myself, and apart\r\nfrom the privilege of my own roof, I warn you at your peril, and on my\r\nown responsibility, never to see Astræa again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you mad?\" I exclaimed. \"Never to see Astræa again! To forsake her\r\nsociety at your bidding! Wherefore do you make this monstrous demand? Do\r\nyou not feel how preposterous it is to thrust yourself into a quarrel\r\nwith me in a matter which not only does not concern you, but which\r\ninvolves the feelings, perhaps the whole future happiness, of a person\r\nwhom you have just ostentatiously declared is the object of your hate?\"\r\n\r\n\"I make no quarrel with you,\" he answered; \"I will not quarrel with you.\r\nI should be mad, indeed, if I did. What! set myself against your thews\r\nand sinews? No, no--I break no bones with you--but I tell you, once\r\nagain, your fate is in my hands. I am your destiny, if you will have it\r\nso. You may trample on the oracle; but you can not, with all your show\r\nof bravery and your proud pretensions, with the lady, too, in triumph on\r\nyour side, escape its denunciations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you, or did you not,\" I inquired, bewildered by his language, and\r\nnot quite satisfied that he was in possession of his senses, \"did you,\r\nor did you not, observe those attentions some months ago of which you\r\nnow complain for the first time?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"And why did you not then speak to me on the subject?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because it wasn't ripe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ripe? If you have any meaning in these obscure hints, why do you not\r\nexplain it for your own sake, since you can not believe that I will\r\nsubmit patiently to your insane threats? Again I ask you, did you, or\r\ndid you not, promote these attentions by every artifice and suggestion\r\nin your power?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not watch them anxiously, forward them daily, and exult in\r\ntheir progress, until you became secretly convinced that both Astræa's\r\nfeelings and mine were engaged beyond recall?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did--I did--I did!\" roared the dwarf.\r\n\r\n\"Did you not produce this very result yourself? Did you not seek it,\r\nurge it, fan it to its height, and even glory in the flame you had\r\nnursed so cunningly?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did--I did--I did!\" he shrieked, his whole body seeming to take part\r\nin the frenzy that convulsed him.\r\n\r\n\"Fiend!\" I cried; \"inexplicable devil! what would you have, then? What\r\nis your aim in thus coming with your curses between us?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall never know,\" he replied, \"unless to deplore it to the last\r\nhour of your life. You can never know unless you outrage my will. I have\r\nthe power to make you wretched forever, to blight and destroy you. And\r\nif you treat my warning with contempt, I will do it without fail,\r\nwithout mercy, without remorse. The jester who has contributed so\r\nlargely to your entertainment, and furnished such a delectable theme for\r\nyour secret and cowardly mockery, will shoot a bolt of a graver cast\r\nwhen you least expect it, and think yourself most secure. Mark me--note\r\nme well. These are not words of rage, or transient passion: remember\r\nthem, be wise, and look to your safety. See Astræa no more. With this I\r\nleave you. Our next meeting must be of your making.\"\r\n\r\nI was alone. Overwhelmed and awed by the demoniacal maledictions of the\r\nwretched creature whom I had hitherto so intensely despised, I knew not\r\nwhat to think, or how to act. He had assumed a fresh shape, more\r\nmarvelous than any he had hitherto put on in the whole round of his\r\nextraordinary mummery. The raillery and tipsy recklessness which\r\nappeared constitutional in him had suddenly passed away, leaving not a\r\nsolitary trace behind. Even his figure, while he had been speaking,\r\nseemed to heave with a new life, and to dilate into unnatural\r\ndimensions. I was perplexed to the last extremity; not that the malice\r\nof the demon could scare me from my resolves, but that his motives were\r\nso impenetrable as to suffer no clew to escape by which I could discover\r\nthe evil purpose that lay at the bottom.\r\n\r\nIt was not the machination or revenge of a disappointed suitor. He never\r\ncould have aspired to a hope of Astræa, and he avowed his aversion to\r\nher. She was ignorant of all this bravado about her; and would be even\r\nmore indignant to hear of it than I was to suffer it. I resolved,\r\ntherefore, not to insult her by revealing it to her. Fortunately, I had\r\nmade an appointment to meet her alone on the following day. That meeting\r\nwould decide every thing. She might, perhaps, throw some light upon what\r\nwas at present a profound mystery to me. At all events, my course was\r\nclear. Under the circumstances in which I was placed, I felt that there\r\nlay but one alternative before me.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nMy resolution was taken, as I thought, very composedly. I tried to\r\npersuade myself that I was not in the least ruffled or agitated by the\r\nscene I had passed through; but I was secretly conscious,\r\nnotwithstanding, of a vague dread which I endeavored in vain to stifle.\r\nThe defiance which the dwarf had so insolently flung at me, the contrast\r\nhe drew between his shriveled frame and my physical advantages, and the\r\nSatanic pride with which he rose superior to his wretched deformities,\r\ngave me no slight cause for uneasiness, although I could not analyze the\r\nnature of the fear that possessed me. All through the night I abandoned\r\nmyself to the wildest speculations upon the unaccountable conduct and\r\ndesigns of my arch-enemy; but as morning advanced that oppressive train\r\nof reflections gave way to more agreeable thoughts, just as the hideous\r\nimages of the night-mare vanish before the approach of day.\r\n\r\nThe prospect of meeting Astræa excluded all other considerations. As\r\nimpediments to the flow of a current only serve to increase its force,\r\nso the opposition which the dwarf had thrown in my way gave an\r\nadditional impetus to my feelings. The very publicity which our\r\nintercourse had attracted altered our relations to each other. It was no\r\nlonger possible to indulge in the romantic dreams, secret looks, and\r\nstolen conversations with which we had hitherto pampered our\r\nimagination; it was necessary to act. I felt the responsibility that was\r\nthus cast upon me; and I confess that I was rather obliged to my\r\nvillainous Mephistophiles than angry with him for having, as it were,\r\nbrought all my wayward raptures to so immediate and decisive a\r\nconclusion. As to his anathemas and warnings, I treated them as so much\r\nbuffoonery on the wrong side of the grotesque. In short, I was too much\r\nengrossed by the approaching interview, and too much intoxicated by the\r\ncontemplation of the result to which it inevitably led, to think at all\r\nabout that imp of darkness and his ludicrous fulminations. Astræa\r\noccupied brain and heart, and left no room for my tormentor.\r\n\r\nI fancied she looked unusually happy that morning; but not so happy as I\r\nwas, not so disturbed and unsettled by happiness. She was perfectly\r\ntranquil, and it was evident that nothing had transpired in the interval\r\nto awaken a suspicion of what had occurred between me and the dwarf. She\r\nobserved at once that a change had taken place in my manner.\r\n\r\n\"You are in marvelously high spirits to-day,\" she said; \"but this\r\nexuberant gayety is not quite natural to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"High spirits! I am not conscious of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the worse,\" she replied; then, placing her hand upon my arm,\r\nand looking earnestly at me, she added, \"something has happened since I\r\nsaw you. What is it? It would be wrong, and useless as well as wrong, to\r\naffect to deny it.\"\r\n\r\nI had noticed at times in Astræa an air of solemnity, which would fall\r\nupon her face like a shadow, slowly receding again before its habitual,\r\nbut always subdued brightness; and occasionally I imagined that I\r\ndetected a sudden and brief sternness in her eyes, which conveyed an\r\nimpression that she was interrogating with their concentrated rays, the\r\nconcealed thoughts of the person upon whom they were directed. These\r\nwere some of the outward signs of that mystery of her nature which I\r\nnever could penetrate. Upon this occasion a world of latent doubts and\r\nsuspicions appeared to be condensed in her look. It seemed as if in that\r\nsingle glance she read the whole incident which, to spare her feelings,\r\nI was so unwilling to disclose.\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose, Astræa,\" I inquired, \"can have happened since I\r\nsaw you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not candid with me,\" she returned. \"I ask you a question, and\r\nyou answer by asking me another. If nothing has happened, you can easily\r\nsatisfy me; if it be otherwise, and you are silent, I must draw my own\r\nconclusions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever conclusions you draw, Astræa, I know you have too firm a\r\nreliance on my truth and devotion not to believe that I am actuated by\r\nthe purest motives. Have I not always been sincere and frank with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Always.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you not an implicit confidence in the steadfastness of my love?\"\r\n\r\n\"Were it otherwise, should I be now standing here questioning you, or\r\nshould there be need of questions of this kind between us? Confidence!\r\nWhy am I so sensitive to the slightest fluctuations of tone and manner I\r\nobserve in you, and where do I derive the intuitive perception of their\r\nmeanings? Love must have confidence! But it has instincts also. I feel\r\nthere is something--I am sure of it--but I will urge you no further. It\r\nis not, perhaps, for your happiness or mine that I should seek to\r\nknow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Astræa,\" I exclaimed, passionately, \"there is nothing I would conceal\r\nfrom you that I think you ought to know, or that would make you happier\r\nto know; and if I have any reserve from you, it is for your sake, and\r\nyou must ascribe it to the tenderness of my regard for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"For _my_ sake?\" she repeated, with a slightly terrified and curious\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\"Now listen to me; I have something to say to you which is of more\r\nimportance to us both than these wise, loving conjectures of yours. Take\r\nmy arm, and let us get into the Park.\"\r\n\r\nWe were near one of the inclosures of the Regent's Park; and when we\r\nreached a more secluded place, I resumed:\r\n\r\n\"First of all, I should like to have your own unbiased opinion about\r\nyour friends with whom you are residing. Have you observed any change in\r\ntheir manner toward you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Change? None whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think--I mean from any thing you have yourself noticed--that\r\nthey have watched our actions or been inquisitive in our affairs?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked inquiringly at me, and hesitated.\r\n\r\n\"I think it would be impossible to be much with them and escape their\r\n_persiflage_, let us act as we might. But beyond that sort of idle\r\ncriticism which they deal out indiscriminately to every body, I have\r\nobserved nothing. Why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I have reason to believe that my attentions to you have\r\nattracted more observation than either of us suspected; and that, in\r\nfact, they have made such remarks on us as no longer leaves our future\r\ncourse at our own time or option.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have reason to believe this?\"\r\n\r\n\"The best possible reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is your authority?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you not accept my own authority, without seeking further?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. It is not a time to hold back from any false delicacy to me, or any\r\nmistaken respect for the confidence of others. Beware of such\r\nconfidences, if there be any. They are not meant for your peace or mine,\r\nbut to plunge us both into an abyss in which we shall be left to perish.\r\nI must know all. I am entitled to know it. If your love be a hundredth\r\npart as strong and devoted, and as prepared for sacrifice as mine, you\r\nwill place a full and entire trust in me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I do. You shall know all; but I must exact a solemn promise from\r\nyou, before I tell you how, and in what manner, this information was\r\ncommunicated to me. It is impossible for me to foresee how it may affect\r\nor wound your feelings; and it is due to me, if I yield to your request\r\nagainst my own judgment, that you should pledge yourself, be the\r\nconsequences what they may, to give me a public right to protect you\r\nagainst the further malignity--I can not call it by any milder term--of\r\nyour enemies and mine.\"\r\n\r\nShe was deeply affected by this request, which was spoken in so low and\r\ntremulous a voice, so burdened with a painful earnestness, that she\r\nappeared to gather from it the final conviction that upon her answer\r\ndepended the future happiness or misery of our lives. I confess, for my\r\nown part, that the pause which ensued, during which she almost\r\nunconsciously repeated to herself, \"Be the consequences what they may!\"\r\nwas to me harrowing beyond expression. It seemed as if there was some\r\nsinister influence at work to destroy us both; and that even the\r\nimmediate prospect of our union was not sufficient to allay the terror\r\nthat influence inspired, and into the causes and springs of which I now\r\nbegan to imagine she had a clearer insight than I had previously\r\nsuspected. But I was steeped in a tumultuous passion, which would not\r\nsuffer me to investigate intervening difficulties. What the source of\r\nher terror was I knew not; mine arose only from the apprehension of\r\nlosing her; and to have secured her at that moment, looking as she did,\r\nin the agitation that gave such a wild lustre to her eyes, more lovely\r\nthan ever, I would have cheerfully relinquished every thing else in the\r\nworld. So far from being anxious to have the cause of her fears and\r\nhesitation cleared up, I was in the utmost alarm lest she should enter\r\nupon an explanation that might delay the consummation of my wishes. I\r\nsought only an affirmative reply to my request, which, come what might,\r\nwould make her mine forever.\r\n\r\nShe loosened herself from my arm, and walked apart from me in silence.\r\nThis action, and the sort of panic it indicated, filled me with alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Astræa, you have not answered my question. What is the reason of your\r\nsilence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be the consequences what they may!\" she reiterated. \"I did not think of\r\nthat, but it is right I should. I should have thought of it before--I\r\ndid think of it; but of what avail, while I suffered myself to indulge\r\nin a dream which that thought ought to have dispelled?\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak in a language that is unintelligible to me; but there is no\r\ntime now for explanations. We must decide, Astræa, at once, for to-day\r\nand forever. I only ask your explicit pledge. Let us reserve\r\nexplanations for hereafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say this in ignorance of what awaits you. I feel that I ought not\r\nto make any pledge until--\" and she hesitated again.\r\n\r\n\"If I am satisfied to take your pledge, and all consequences with it,\r\nand to repay it with the devotion of my life, why, beloved Astræa,\r\nshould you hesitate? Let the responsibility fall on me--of that another\r\ntime. Every hour is precious now, and you will understand why I urge you\r\nso impatiently when I tell you that I can never again enter the house\r\nwhere you are now residing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew it. I saw it clearly from the first word you uttered. It was\r\nrevealed to me in the very tone of your voice. Now hear me patiently.\r\nYour peace, your honor, all feelings that contribute to the respect and\r\nhappiness of life, are at stake upon this moment.\"\r\n\r\nThe determination of her manner left me no choice but to listen.\r\n\r\n\"Are you prepared to risk all other ties, obligations, and prospects, in\r\nthe consummation of this one object? to hazard friends, opinion, the\r\nworld--perhaps it may be, to sacrifice them for the love that has grown\r\nup between us, and which, for good or evil, must this day bind us\r\ntogether, or sever us for the rest of our lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"What a question to put to me! The 'world!' it is ashes without you. I\r\ntell you, Astræa, that if the choice lay between the grave and the\r\nsingle word that would sunder us, I would die rather than utter it. I\r\ndon't know what your question implies--I don't seek to know; and would\r\nprefer to remain ignorant of it, that I may the more clearly prove to\r\nyou the depth of my trust and devotion, which will be satisfied with the\r\nsimple pledge that makes you mine. That, at least, you have in your own\r\npower; let me answer for the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Consider well what you are saying. Is your love strong enough to bear\r\nthe hazards I have pointed out? Search your own nature--look into your\r\npride, your sensitiveness to neglect and censure, your high sense of\r\npersonal dignity. I have seen how ill you can brook slight affronts--do\r\nyou believe that your love will enable you to bear great ones--scorn,\r\ncontumely, perhaps opprobrium? Think, think, and weigh well your\r\ndecision.\"\r\n\r\n\"Astræa, you put me upon the rack. I have no other answer to give. For\r\nyou, and for your sake, come what may, I am ready to risk all!\"\r\n\r\n\"For me and for my sake, if it be necessary, to forsake the world? to\r\nrelinquish friends and kindred? to dedicate yourself in solitude to her\r\nwho, in solitude, would be content to find her whole world in you? To do\r\nthis, without repining, without looking back with anguish and remorse\r\nupon the sacrifices you had made, without a regret or a reproach? A\r\nwoman can do this. Is it so sure there lives a man equal to such\r\ntrials?\"\r\n\r\n\"If these sacrifices be imperative upon us, we make them together. There\r\ncan be nothing for either of us to reproach the other with. And as to\r\nthe solitude you speak of, my heart yearns for it. It is in that\r\nsolitude we can the more fully understand and develop the profound\r\ndevotion that shall have drawn us into it. I am sick of the world--weary\r\nand tired of it, and longing for the repose which you alone can\r\nconsecrate. It will be no sacrifice to abandon the world for you.\r\nSacrifice, my Astræa? it will be the crowning happiness of my life!\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are confident that you can depend upon the firmness of your\r\nresolution? I do not ask this for my own sake--for I know myself, what I\r\ncan suffer and outlive--but for yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"I solemnly and finally answer, that no earthly influence can shake my\r\nresolution.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Astræa, placing her hand in mine, and in a grave voice,\r\nladen with emotion, \"I am yours forever. Henceforth, I owe no allegiance\r\nelsewhere--here, in the sight of Heaven, I pledge my faith to you, and\r\nhold the compact as binding as if at this moment it were plighted at the\r\naltar.\"\r\n\r\nI was transported with the earnestness of these words, and covering her\r\nhand with kisses, I exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"And I ratify it, Astræa, my own Astræa, with my whole heart. Now, who\r\nshall divide us? We are one, and no human power can part us.\"\r\n\r\nI then related to her the circumstances that had taken place the\r\npreceding evening. She heard me throughout with a calmness that\r\nsurprised me. I expected that the extraordinary conduct of the dwarf\r\nwould have excited her indignation; but she seemed to know him better\r\nthan I did, and although I could perceive a heavy flush sometimes rush\r\ninto her cheeks, and a sudden pallor succeed it, the narrative of his\r\nmysterious menaces did not appear to produce half as much astonishment\r\nin her mind as it did in mine.\r\n\r\n\"We will talk of this another time,\" she observed; \"at present we must\r\nthink of ourselves. I know his character--I know the demoniac revenge he\r\nis capable of; and, for our own safety, we must avoid him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Revenge!\" I echoed. The phrase coming from Astræa fell strangely on my\r\nears.\r\n\r\n\"I will leave the house to-morrow; but, for your sake, I will hold no\r\ncommunication with you till I am beyond his reach. Once assured of that,\r\nI will write to you, and you will come to me. This is the only act I\r\nwill ask to take upon my own responsibility, and I do so because it will\r\nsecure our mutual safety. From that hour I shall be implicitly guided by\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nI should have been glad to have adopted a different course, and to have\r\nclaimed her openly. My pride, wounded by the insolent denunciations of\r\nthe dwarf, demanded a more public vindication of her independence and\r\nmine; and this stolen flight, and the necessity it imposed upon me of\r\nobserving a similar caution in my own movements, looked so like fear and\r\nevasion that I submitted to it very reluctantly. The notion of\r\nconcealment and secrecy galled me, and even at this moment, when my\r\nhappiness was on the eve of consummation, it gave me a thrill of\r\nuneasiness that cast an oppressive shadow over the future. Astræa,\r\nhowever, had evidently a strong reason for insisting on privacy, and I\r\nwas too anxious about hastening our union to throw any new obstacle in\r\nthe way of its accomplishment.\r\n\r\nWe separated in the Park, Astræa being unwilling to suffer me to escort\r\nher any further lest we should be seen together. This little incident,\r\ntrifling as it was, increased the nervous annoyance and sense of\r\nhumiliation I felt at being required to act as if I had any fear of the\r\nresults; nor could I comprehend why she should be so much alarmed at\r\nbeing seen walking with me alone, when she knew that in a few days we\r\nshould be indissolubly united. But I submitted to her wishes. Passion is\r\nwillful and unreasonable, and takes a wayward pleasure in shutting its\r\neyes, and rushing onward in the dare. I stifled my vexation in the\r\nanticipation of the joy that lay before me, which would be victory\r\nenough over the impotent hatred of Mephistophiles.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole of the next day I waited anxiously in the\r\nexpectation of hearing from Astræa. Evening came and passed, and there\r\nwas no communication. When the last post-hour was gone by, and all hope\r\nof a letter was at an end, I ventured into the streets, hoping to gather\r\nsome signs of her movements from the outside of her house. The blinds\r\nwere down as usual in the drawing-room windows, and there seemed to be\r\nrather an extraordinary flush of lights within, as if some commotion was\r\ngoing forward. I could see huge, shapeless shadows of people moving\r\nabout the room, in great bustle and excitement; and it appeared to me,\r\nfrom the frequency and confusion of then: motions, that the ordinary\r\nfamily party was augmented by additional numbers. The gathering,\r\nwhatever it might have been, was not for festivity; and the constant\r\nswaying backward and forward, and vehement tossing of long streaks of\r\nheads and arms on the blinds, resembled the action of a violent domestic\r\nscene, in which the angry passions were strenuously engaged. I hardly\r\nknew what to conclude from this incoherent pantomime. Either Astræa was\r\nthere, in the midst of a stormy contention; or she had left the house,\r\nand they were disputing furiously over the causes of her departure.\r\n\r\nAfter I had been some time watching this unintelligible phantasmagoria,\r\nand vainly endeavoring to collect a meaning for it, the hall-door\r\nopened, and in the momentary gleam of light that shot into the street I\r\nsaw the dwarf issuing out, muffled to the ears in a cloak. He stood for\r\na moment on the pavement, and adjusting his cloak more carefully about\r\nhis face, and crushing his hat down over his eyes, he set off at a quick\r\npace in an opposite direction to that part of the street where I was\r\nstanding. I confess I felt ashamed of the espionage in which I was\r\noccupied, and although I followed my mercurial fiend at a safe distance,\r\nfor the distinct purpose of earthing him wherever he was going, I by no\r\nmeans liked the office which a sort of fatality had forced upon me. But\r\nI was somewhat reconciled to it by a secret conviction that the\r\nabominable little demon had himself come out upon an equally\r\ndiscreditable expedition, which I soon detected from the infinite pains\r\nhe took to elude observation.\r\n\r\nInstead of keeping in the public streets, he darted down numerous dark\r\nalleys and lanes, and once with considerable difficulty I chased him\r\nthrough the unsavory depths of a straggling mews, where he doubled in an\r\nout with such rapidity as to render it no easy matter to keep upon his\r\ntrack without betraying myself. Two or three times I nearly lost sight\r\nof him; and it was not until he emerged out of a gloomy passage, of the\r\nexistence of which I was until that moment ignorant, into the street\r\nwhere I lived, that I had the least suspicion of the direction he was\r\ntaking. It was presently evident that his object had some reference to\r\nme, for he had no sooner entered the street than he darted into the deep\r\nrecess of a hall-door, where he stood for full ten minutes crouched and\r\ntransfixed, looking up at my windows, which were exactly opposite to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nFortunately I was able to note his movements without being myself\r\nperceived, as I lurked in the shadow of the passage from whence he had\r\njust issued.\r\n\r\nThe windows of my chambers being dark, I presume he concluded that I was\r\nfrom home; and under that impression, no doubt, he crossed over and\r\nknocked stealthily at the door--just as one would knock who did not wish\r\nto attract the attention of the inmates, but merely to convey an\r\nintimation to the servants. I was seized with a strong impulse to rush\r\nupon him suddenly, present myself as the door opened, and confound him\r\non the spot; but I remembered how earnestly Astræa had urged upon me the\r\nprudence of avoiding him, and I restrained myself. Stepping cautiously\r\ninto a doorway, I continued to watch his further proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe door was opened by a servant, and my dwarf, burying himself up to\r\nthe eyes in his cloak, so that it was impossible to distinguish his\r\nfeatures, appeared to enter into a confidential conversation with her.\r\nIt seemed to me to last a long time; but my impatience, no doubt,\r\nexaggerated its duration. At length it drew to an end, and hastily\r\nnodding to the servant, who looked after him, as I thought with much\r\ncuriosity and astonishment, he dropped down the street at the same\r\nflying pace with which he had entered it. That he had come to my house\r\nfor the purpose of picking up some intelligence about me was clear; upon\r\nthat point I was satisfied, and the discovery only served to heighten my\r\nanxiety to find out what he was going to do next.\r\n\r\nAs he darted along I could not help admiring his wonderful agility.\r\nThere was a certain sort of confident swagger about his ordinary style\r\nof walking, such as you frequently observe in small vivacious men, who\r\nstrut and swing through the streets as if the great globe itself were\r\ntheir private property; but upon this occasion it resolved itself into\r\nthe swift and impetuous flight of a meteor. He shot from one angle of a\r\nstreet to another something in the manner of a will-o'-the-wisp, and it\r\nwas almost as difficult to fix his course and follow him up. Thus\r\nhanging closely on his footsteps, I was not a little mortified to find,\r\nafter all, that the trouble I had taken led to nothing. Striking out a\r\ndifferent, but a much shorter route, the hideous creature went back to\r\nhis own house. The lights were already extinguished in the\r\ndrawing-room, and the windows, even to the dormitories, were in\r\ndarkness. The domestics, apparently, had retired to bed; for the dwarf,\r\nhastily opening the door with a latch-key, vanished from my sight almost\r\nat the same instant that he ascended the steps. I lingered for A few\r\nmoments at a distance, and then slowly returned home, congratulating\r\nmyself on having detected his sinister expedition, and impatient to\r\nascertain the substance of his conversation with the servant.\r\n\r\nWhen I interrogated her on the subject, she betrayed a little fear and\r\nhesitation, but at last she told me every thing that had transpired. The\r\nstrange gentleman, whom she had never seen before, and who so completely\r\nconcealed his features that she should not be able to identify him\r\nagain, asked her a great number of questions about my movements, and\r\nespecially if I had been out during the day. He appeared surprised to\r\nlearn that I had only just left home, and wanted to know whether I was\r\nexpected back that night, and whether I was going out of town. It\r\nhappened that I had occupied myself throughout the morning in packing my\r\ncarpet-bag and portmanteau, so that I might be able to attend Astræa's\r\nexpected summons at a moment's notice; and the servant, whose distrust\r\nwas awakened by the urgent manner of the questioner, tried to fence off\r\nhis inquiries about my traveling preparations, but his superior\r\ndexterity finally extracted the fact from her. Having obtained that\r\nsignificant clew to my intentions, he suddenly wished her good-night,\r\nand disappeared. The girl was so frightened by his mysterious air and\r\nabrupt interrogations, that I believe she fancied I was going to fight a\r\nduel; for about that time there had been a fatal duel, which furnished a\r\ntopic of general conversation, and which, I suppose, put the sagacious\r\nsuspicion into her head.\r\n\r\n\"Forewarned, forearmed,\" says the old proverb. I was now fairly apprised\r\nthat the dwarf was upon my track, and I resolved, as a mere measure of\r\nprecaution, ignorant as I was of the machinations I had to fear, that\r\nwhatever course it might become necessary to adopt, should be carried\r\nout with the utmost secrecy.\r\n\r\nThe next morning came a letter from Astræa. No language can adequately\r\ndepict the agitation with which I opened the envelope. I felt as if my\r\nfate was contained in the inclosure--as it was!\r\n\r\nIt consisted of only a single line, scrawled in haste over a great sheet\r\nof paper, at the top of which was an address in the country, in another\r\nhand-writing, with the following words beneath, written by Astræa:\r\n\r\n\"I am here: come to me _quickly_.--A.\"\r\n\r\nThe assurance which this brief intimation conveyed that Astræa had left\r\nLondon, relieved me of at least one source of anxiety; and all that now\r\nremained was to obey her mandate, and join her without loss of time in\r\nher retreat. I own that I felt rather like a culprit in the way in\r\nwhich I abandoned my chambers. Feeling assured that the dwarf, having\r\nonce set himself as a spy upon my actions, would stop at no means of\r\ntracing me out of town, I determined to leave such an account of myself\r\nbehind as should effectually put him upon a false scent. I accordingly\r\ninformed the people of the house that I was going into Buckinghamshire\r\nfor two days; and, as that was nearly the opposite direction to the\r\nroute I was really about to take--for my destination lay among the\r\nsylvan valleys of Kent--I hoped to baffle him at the start. My\r\narrangements were speedily completed, and, having made a hasty\r\ninspection of the street before I ventured out, I sprang into a\r\ncabriolet, and drove off.\r\n\r\nThe imperceptible degrees by which men, in the pursuit of passionate\r\nends, suffer themselves to fall into deceptions, at which their reason\r\nand their probity would revolt in calmer moments, might suggest a useful\r\ntrain of reflections at this point of my narrative. But the moral is\r\nobvious enough, without requiring to be formally pointed. I shall only\r\nremark, that my ruminations in the post-chaise that carried me to Astræa\r\nran chiefly upon the self-humiliation I felt in contemplating the\r\nmystery in which I had become entangled step by step, and the sort of\r\nguiltiness which my studious evasion of the dwarf seemed to argue to my\r\nown mind. Men who act openly never have any reason to entertain a fear\r\nof others, and may look the world boldly in the face. It is only men\r\nthat commit themselves to actions which will not bear the light who\r\nresort to subterfuges and concealments, and are harrowed by\r\napprehensions. My dilemma was a singular one. There was nothing I had\r\ndone which I had the slightest reason to hide or feel alarm about; yet I\r\nwas taking as cautious measures to avoid publicity as if I were flying\r\nfrom justice, and was haunted all the time by a thrill of terror which I\r\ncould not assign to any intelligible cause.\r\n\r\nIn the dusk of the evening, I had the profound happiness of reaching my\r\ndestination, and all inquietude was lulled into oblivion by the music of\r\nthose tones which always went direct to my heart. The past and the\r\nfuture were equally absorbed in the luxury of Astræa's society, and I\r\nfelt that if I needed an excuse for the strange circumstances in which I\r\nwas placed, I had an ample one in the devotion of such a woman. The very\r\ndanger--if danger it was, with which I was as yet unacquainted--the\r\nanxiety, the concealment, the flight we had passed through to secure our\r\nunion, enhanced the rapture with which we now met never to be sundered\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThat evening I related to her what had happened the night before, and\r\nshe gave me an account of the manner in which she had managed to escape\r\nfrom the dwarf's house; for, in spite of the self-possession with which\r\nshe described the incident, it more nearly resembled an escape than a\r\ndeparture. In fact, she had left the house in the morning, on foot, and\r\nwas expected back, as usual, to luncheon after her walk. But luncheon\r\npassed, and there were no tidings of her; and, at dinner-time, a brief\r\nnote by the post announced her leave-taking, excusing its abruptness, on\r\nthe ground of a sudden and urgent call into the country. This was, no\r\ndoubt, the subject which the angry shadows on the blinds had been so\r\nvehemently discussing the night before. So violent an infraction of\r\netiquette would have pained me seriously had it occurred under any other\r\ncircumstances, or had it been inflicted upon any other persons than the\r\nmembers of that eccentric family. But we knew them well; how unlike they\r\nwere to the rest of the world, and how slight an impression the mere\r\nbreach of courtesy would make upon them, in comparison with the\r\nmalicious curiosity it would awaken! They were like Bohemians in their\r\nhabits and ways of thinking; and were themselves so accustomed to\r\nviolate established usages, that the most extravagant irregularities\r\ncould not very materially surprise them. This consideration reconciled\r\nme to a proceeding which must otherwise have been a source of regret to\r\nme, on Astræa's account; besides, I was by no means unwilling to accept\r\nthe sacrifice she had thus made of her own independence as an additional\r\nproof of her attachment.\r\n\r\nBut what was the cause of all these stratagems and concealments? I\r\nshould learn that the next day. I saw that Astræa was suffering under a\r\ndespondency natural enough to her novel situation, and I patiently\r\nwaited her own time for disclosures which I now began to look forward to\r\nwith nervous apprehensions.\r\n\r\nThe house in which I found her lay buried in the foliage of a secluded\r\nvalley. It was in the cottage style, covered with creepers that dropped\r\nin at the windows, and filled the rooms with scent; and it belonged to\r\npeople in an humble rank of life, who had known Astræa from her infancy,\r\nand were devoted to her interest. Under the shelter of their roof, she\r\nwas secure. The place was extremely picturesque on a small scale--a\r\ngreen glen, where the surrounding heights were broken into a variety of\r\nforms, and where the eye, on whatever spot it rested, caught some point\r\nof beauty. An impetuous little stream rushed from the jaws of a ravine\r\nthat formed a sort of vista at one extremity, and, brawling away through\r\nthe wooded depths of the valley, tossed itself into the air over a group\r\nof artificial rooks at the foot of the tiny lawn. Dark trees filled the\r\nopenings in the hills, and the sward round their roots was dotted with\r\nclusters of wild flowers, like a garden. A rustic bridge spanned the\r\nwater, and graceful willows dipped their tresses into the spray. Aquatic\r\nplants clung about the rocks--parasite tendrils climbed the ancient\r\nwood; and there was altogether a feeling of solitude and repose in the\r\nscene, that rendered it the most fitting seclusion on earth to ripen\r\ninto a new life of love two ardent hearts like ours.\r\n\r\nWith what anxiety I looked forward to the next day, when Astræa and I,\r\nliberated from all eyes, should wander about these lonely paths! It came\r\nat last, and with it brought my doom!\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORY OF SILVER-VOICE AND HER SISTER ZOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of memory are singular objects of study. I have often\r\nthought that a certain class of ideas and observations could be so\r\narranged as to form an orderly, connected chain, one link of which would\r\nbring home all the others, however deeply sunken in the mind. But\r\nexperience teaches me that this is not the case. During my residence in\r\nthe East, though I kept a careful journal of every thing that seemed\r\ninteresting at the time, a thousand circumstances came to my notice\r\nwhich I did not set down; and when I have endeavored to recall them,\r\nmany have stubbornly refused to appear when wanted. But suddenly, when I\r\nat least expect it, I now and then find myself irresistibly carried back\r\nto old times. Forms that had faded into distance--thoughts that had\r\nseemed dissolved into nothing--scenes and impressions which I had in\r\nvain sought to revive--obtrude themselves irresistibly on my notice. In\r\ngeneral, the unexpected visitants are welcome; the fireside is rendered\r\nbrighter and more cheerful by them; and their presence sends a glow\r\nthrough this northern atmosphere, which allows autumn to steal on\r\nunperceived.\r\n\r\nI was prevented last night from sleeping by the perpetual recurrence in\r\nmy reveries of the name of Lady Silver-Voice. I had forgotten her\r\nexistence, as one is apt to forget a beautiful thing amidst the material\r\ncares of this life. Let me endeavor to tell her story as simply as it\r\nwas told to me.\r\n\r\nBut first, how I came to see her--for I have had that privilege. It was\r\none evening in winter-time, that, after a prolonged illness, I was\r\ntaking a stroll on the roof of a palace-like mansion in Cairo. The sun\r\nhad set _for me_; it had gone down behind the interminable sea of\r\nhouses. But I could still see it shining on the forest of minarets that\r\nrose through the moist, balmy air, and on the vast dome of the mosque\r\nthat now towers above the citadel. The terrace-roof on which I was,\r\nthough commanded at a distance by much more lofty buildings, was far\r\nraised above the humble dwellings near at hand, so that I could look\r\ndown and observe the movements of my neighbors, who were most varied in\r\nrace and costume--Turks and Maltese, Arabs and Greeks, Armenians and\r\nCopts--to say nothing of \"Jews and poultry,\" which my servant, who\r\nbrought me a pipe, added to the enumeration.\r\n\r\nI passed some time in examining the movements of these various\r\npersonages, who all come out upon their terraces to enjoy the evening\r\nair; and though I did not observe any thing very characteristic, any\r\nthing which would necessarily go down in my journal, I was sufficiently\r\ninterested not to notice the flight of time, and to allow complete\r\ndarkness to gather round me while I still leaned over the parapet.\r\nSuddenly I was aroused from my contemplations by a snatch of a strange\r\nsong sung in the most marvelously-sweet voice I had ever heard. I\r\nstarted, not exactly like a guilty thing, but transfixed, as it were, by\r\nan almost painful shaft of delight. The voice swelled up on the night\r\nair, until, in spite of its divine sweetness, it became almost a cry of\r\nsorrow, and then ceased, leaving a thrill running through my frame that\r\ngradually seemed to shrink back to my heart, and expire there in a\r\nfeeling of mingled joy and pain. Perhaps the state of my health rendered\r\nme peculiarly susceptible of strong emotions: I am afraid I wept. The\r\ndarkness, however, prevented this weakness from being witnessed by Ali,\r\nwho came to announce that my dinner was ready. I went down the winding\r\nstaircase to the vast lonely hall, where I usually ate alone--the master\r\nof the house being absent on a journey; but though my appetite was that\r\nof a convalescent, I am sure I did not enliven the meal for myself by my\r\nusual humorous observations: to the officer, for example, that I was\r\ndoubtful whether the beef was camel, or the mutton was donkey. Ali\r\nseemed rather surprised, especially when I asked him, abruptly, who it\r\nwas that sang so sweetly in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nHe did not know! My curiosity was unsatisfied; but, perhaps, I went to\r\nbed that night with a fuller gush of happiness at my heart than if I had\r\nheard this prosy fellow's account of the matter. It is a frequent\r\nsubject of meditation with me, whether or not I am constituted as other\r\nmen are. Are others played upon in this way by some slight\r\noccurrence--by meeting with a face seen before only in a dream, by a\r\npeculiar smile, by a gesture, by a sigh, by a voice singing in the\r\ndarkness? If not, who will understand the delicious watchful hours I\r\npassed that night, or the dreams, spangled with bright eyes, fairy\r\nforms, purple clouds, golden gleams, and buzzing with sweeter warblings\r\nthan ever rolled in a nightingale's throat, that lured me on until\r\nmorning?\r\n\r\nNaturally, the first inquiries I made were about the voice; but I did\r\nnot that day meet with any success. When evening approached, I again\r\nwent up to the terrace; and, not to lengthen the story, I did see, just\r\nas the sun went down upon a low house not very far off, but looking into\r\nanother street, a little fairy figure walking up and down, and leading a\r\nchild by the hand. A kind of instinct told me that the voice was\r\nembodied before me; and, presently, all doubt was set at rest. The same\r\nsilver tones rose upon the air; and this time I recognized that the song\r\nwas in the Greek language. I remained looking intently in that\r\ndirection, until the form faded into a mere shadow; and then, as\r\ndarkness increased, seemed to multiply before my aching eyes, and assume\r\nall sorts of fantastical shapes. Every now and then, a couplet, or a\r\nstanza, came sweeping up. It was evident the lady, whoever she might\r\nbe, was not singing merely to amuse the child. The notes were sometimes\r\nlively, but, in general, sad and plaintive. I listened long after the\r\nlast quaver had died away; and was rather sulky when Ali came with the\r\npersevering joke that \"the camel was getting cold!\"\r\n\r\nNext day I suddenly remembered that an old Greek priest had frequently\r\ninvited me to go to his house; and reproaching myself with the want of\r\npoliteness I had hitherto exhibited, I ordered my donkey to be saddled,\r\nand started off. The ride was only of a few streets; it seemed to me\r\nquite a journey. On arriving, the worthy _papa_ was fortunately at home,\r\nand by himself. He was delighted with my visit; and, after a small\r\naltercation with his servant, succeeded in getting me some coffee and a\r\npipe. I admired the art with which I wound toward my query. The old\r\ngentleman suspected nothing; but when I casually asked if he knew who it\r\nwas among his countrymen who sang like an angel, he quickly replied, \"It\r\nmust be Silver-Voice, as she is called among the Moslem!\"\r\n\r\nI overturned my pipe on the mat in my eagerness to turn round and\r\nlisten. Excellent old man! instead of clapping his hands for the\r\nservant, he went down upon his knees to collect the scattered tobacco,\r\nand replace it in the bowl, and silenced my excuse with as mild an \"It\r\nis no matter, my son!\" as ever passed the lips of one of our species. He\r\ngrew before my eyes in that humble posture; and when he returned to his\r\nseat, seemed fifty times as venerable as before. The same spirit would\r\nhave led him to wash the feet of the poor.\r\n\r\nHe then told me the story of Silver-Voice and her sister:\r\n\r\n\"Many years ago, a Greek merchant was walking through the slave-market,\r\nwhen he beheld for sale a little girl, so beautiful, and yet so sad,\r\nthat though he was on the way to conclude a bargain for fifty thousand\r\nardebs of beans, he could not prevail on himself to pass indifferently\r\non.\r\n\r\n\"'Of what country?' he inquired.\r\n\r\n\"'A Candiote,' replied the slave-dealer. She was from his own beloved\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\"'How much?'\r\n\r\n\"'Five thousand piastres.'\r\n\r\n\"'I will pay the price.' The bargain was concluded on the spot. Another\r\nmerchant got the beans; but Kariades took home the Silver-Voice to his\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n\"The girl followed him silently, hanging down her head, and refusing to\r\nanswer the questions he put in his kind, bluff way. Some great sorrow\r\nevidently weighed upon her, and she refused to be comforted. When,\r\nhowever, Kariades presented her to his wife, and said, 'This shall be\r\nour daughter,' the child opened her mouth and cried, 'Wherefore, oh\r\nfather, didst thou not come to the slave-market one short hour before?'\r\nHe asked her meaning, and she explained that her sister had been\r\nseparated from her, and sold to a Turk; 'and,' cried she, 'I will not\r\nlive unless Zoë be brought back to my side.' Kariades smiled as he\r\nreplied, 'I went forth, this day to buy beans, and I have come back with\r\na daughter. Must I needs go and fetch another?' 'You must!' said the\r\ngirl, resolutely.\r\n\r\n\"From that hour forth she was the queen in the house. Kariades returned\r\nto the slave-market, but, strange to say, could find no clew to the fate\r\nof Zoë, although he offered double her price to the dealer. It was\r\nbelieved that she had been bought by a stranger merely passing through\r\nCairo, and making no stay; for the public crier was employed to go about\r\nthe streets and proclaim that whoever would produce the girl should\r\nreceive whatever he demanded. All was in vain. Time passed on; and the\r\nactive grief of the Silver-Voice sobered down into steadfast melancholy.\r\nShe continued living as the daughter or rather as the mistress of the\r\nhouse, knowing no want but that of her sister, and enchanting every one\r\nwith the magnificence of her singing, until she reached the age of\r\nsixteen years.\r\n\r\n\"One day Kariades said to her, 'My child, I must seek a husband for thee\r\namong the merchants of my people.' But she firmly refused, declaring\r\nthat there could be no joy for her unless she knew that her sister was\r\nnot living in wretched thralldom in the house of some cruel Turk.\r\n\r\n\"'But,' said he, 'what if death have overtaken her?'\r\n\r\n\"'We promised, as we lay folded in each other's arms the night before we\r\nwere parted, to be happy or sorrowful together--to laugh at the same\r\ntime, to weep at the same time--and if one died, the other was never to\r\ncease grieving. I remember that, as they were dragging Zoë away, she\r\nturned her pale face, all sparkling with tears, toward me, and cried,\r\n_forever_!'\r\n\r\n\"'Meaning that you were parted forever?'\r\n\r\n\"'No; but that we were to be faithful to our vow forever. I never shall\r\nforget the agonizing expression of that face. How can I? I see it every\r\nnight in my dreams; and painful though it be, I rush into sleep as\r\neagerly to behold it as if I were going into Paradise. No: I will never\r\nmarry while that face threatens to interpose between my husband and me.'\r\n\r\n\"'Then this vision torments thee?'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah, father!' and she shuddered, and bent her head.\r\n\r\n\"It was evident that her mind was weakened by too much contemplation of\r\none idea.\r\n\r\n\"Kariades yielded before a will stronger than his own, and nothing more\r\nwas said either about marriage or the lost Zoë for nearly a year. At the\r\nend of this time, Silver-Voice appeared before the good old man, and\r\nsaid, 'Father, give me money; I have thought of a means by which I may\r\nfind my sister Zoë.' He looked sadly at her, but gave her what she\r\nrequired. Next day she disappeared, and was not heard of for several\r\nweeks. Then she returned, consoled her adopted parents by her presence\r\nfor a while, and again departed without giving the least indication of\r\nhow she employed her time. Nor did they ask her, confident that all she\r\ndid was prompted by that most powerful of all loves--the love of a\r\nsister supplying a mother's place. \"The truth was, that she had hired a\r\nnumber of houses in various parts of Cairo, and visited them\r\nalternately, in order to pass the evenings singing on the terrace.\r\nDespite the failure of the researches made by Kariades, she remained\r\npersuaded that Zoë was in Cairo, and hoped that the echoes of her\r\nmagnificent voice might at length go as messengers into the depths of\r\nevery harem, and make known her presence. The whole city was by turns\r\nrendered happy by the Silver-Voice; but as it was heard now in the\r\nCitadel, now near the Bisket-el-Fil, anon at the Bab Zuweileh, men began\r\nto think strange things. It was curious, indeed, to hear the\r\nspeculations of the gossiping Turks about this ubiquitous voice. I\r\nremember laughing much at the wise arguments by which one of them, who\r\nhad heard the fable of Memnon's statue, demonstrated to me that the\r\nsound came from no human organ at all, but was produced by the rays of\r\nthe setting sun striking in some peculiar way upon the minarets.\r\n\r\n\"A whole year passed in this manner without bringing any thing new; but\r\nthe beautiful patience of the Silver-Voice was at length after a fashion\r\nrewarded. Better had it been, perhaps, for her, had her soul been wafted\r\naway in some sad song. She was standing one evening, long after the sun\r\nhad set, filling the air with her plaintive notes, and calling, as\r\nusual, upon her sister; suddenly there rose a cry--a piercing, terrible\r\ncry, such as no mortal ever utters but when the sanctuary of life is\r\ninvaded. At that awful sound the Silver-Voice was struck dumb. She stood\r\nlistening like a gazelle when it hears the howl of a wolf afar off upon\r\nthe desert. The wild accents seemed to hang for a moment over her, and\r\nthen fell into her ear, moulding, as they fell, into the words, \"My\r\nsister!\" How it came to pass she could not tell: over the parapet, along\r\na crumbling wall, across a ruined house, she passed as if by magic,\r\nuntil she fell like a moonbeam through an open window, and saw upon a\r\nrich couch the form of an expiring woman lying. It was her sister Zoë.\r\nThe blow had been too well aimed: it had gone to her heart, and the\r\nlife-blood bubbled rapidly forth between her white fingers, which she\r\npressed, to her side. One eloquent glance, in which eyes mingled with\r\neyes, while lips hung upon lips, was exchanged. There was not time,\r\nneither was there need, to tell their stories in any other way. The\r\ndying woman made one effort, pointed to a cradle that stood under a\r\ncloud of gauze curtains in a corner, then smiled a long, impassioned\r\nsmile of recognition, of gratitude, and of love, seemed to wander a\r\nlittle back in memory, murmured some pleasant sounds, and was still.\r\n\r\n\"The Silver-Voice rose solemnly, and casting her eyes about, beheld a\r\nman crouching in a corner weeping. 'It is all over!' she said. 'All\r\nover!' he replied, looking up. But I will not weary you with the scene\r\nin which the wretched man--a Greek renegade--related how he had bought\r\nZoë--how he had loved her, and made her his wife--how they had traveled\r\nin far countries--how he was jealous, ever, as he acknowledged, without\r\ncause--and how, in a fit of madness, he had slain the mother of his\r\nchild. When he had finished, he led the bewildered Silver-Voice to the\r\ncradle, and thrusting aside the curtains, disclosed the miniature\r\ncounterpart of Zoë, sleeping as if it had been lulled into deeper\r\nslumber by its mother's death-cries. Then, stealing toward the corpse\r\nwith the step of one about to commit a new crime, he snatched a hasty\r\nkiss, and rushed away. What became of him was never known. Silver-Voice\r\nperformed the last duties for poor Zoë, and took the child under her\r\ncare. Since that time she has almost always continued to live in the\r\nhouse from the roof of which she heard her sister's cry; and though\r\napparently rational in every thing else, never fails to go up each\r\nevening and sing the song she used to sing of old, though in a more\r\nplaintive and despairing tone. If asked wherefore she acts in this wise,\r\nher reply is, that she is seeking for her sister Zoë, and nobody\r\nattempts to contradict the harmless delusion. Several years have now\r\npassed away since this event, and the child has become a handsome boy.\r\nYou may see them both at the church to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nI thanked the worthy _papa_ for his story more warmly, perhaps, than he\r\nexpected. He had been as much pleased by narrating as I had been by\r\nlistening; but he was not very particular about the quality of his\r\nfacts, and unintentionally made me do penance for the excessive pleasure\r\nI had experienced by giving me an account--two hours long, and with\r\nequal unction--of a tremendous controversy then raging as to the proper\r\nform of electing the sub-patriarch of Cairo. It would have been\r\nungrateful to interrupt him, although there seemed no end to his\r\ngarrulity. Fortunately, two or three people at length came in; I\r\ncompromised my dignity as a heretic by kissing his hand, and escaped, to\r\nturn over this curious story in my mind. Next day I went to the Greek\r\nchurch, and saw a melancholy-looking face through the bars of the\r\ncage-like gallery in which the women sit. I am quite certain it was that\r\nof Lady Silver-Voice, but no one whom I asked seemed to know her. The\r\nboy did not show himself. It was my intention to go another Sunday, and\r\nobserve more accurately, for I really felt a deep interest in this\r\nunfortunate lady. But other thoughts and occupations came upon me, and\r\nit was only by an accident that, as I have said, these circumstances\r\nrecurred last night to my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CROCODILE BATTERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1846, when every body in England was crazy with railway\r\ngambling, I was sojourning on the banks of the Rohan, a small stream in\r\none of the northwestern provinces of India. Here I first became\r\nacquainted, with the Mugger, or Indian crocodile. I had often before\r\nleaving England, seen, in museums, stuffed specimens of the animal, and\r\nhad read in \"Voyages and Travels,\" all sorts of horrible and incredible\r\nstories concerning them. I had a lively recollection of Waterton riding\r\nclose to the water's edge on the back of an American cayman, and I had a\r\nconfused notion of sacred crocodiles on the banks of the Nile. I always\r\nfelt more or less inclined to regard the whole race as having affinities\r\nwith Sinbad's \"roc,\" and the wild men of the woods, who only refrained\r\nfrom speaking for fear of being made to work.\r\n\r\nMy ideas respecting the natural history of crocodiles were in this stage\r\nof development when, one day, while paddling up the Rohan, I saw what\r\nappeared to be a half-burned log of wood lying on a sand-bank. I paddled\r\nclose up to it. To my astonishment, it proved to be a huge reptile. The\r\nold stories of dragons, griffins, and monsters, seemed no longer fables;\r\nthe speculations of geologists concerning, _mososaurians, hylæsaurians,_\r\nand _plesiosaurians_, were no longer dreams. There, in all his scaly\r\nmagnificence, was a _real_ saurian, nearly eighteen feet long. For a\r\nwhile I stood gazing at this, to me, new fellow-citizen of the world,\r\nand speculating on his mental constitution. The monster was, or\r\npretended to be, asleep. I wondered if he dreamt, and what his dreams or\r\nreveries might be about; possibly he was dreaming of the same old world\r\nwith which I associated him--possibly of the fish who were swimming in\r\nthe waters below: or, he might be thinking of the men and women he had\r\nswallowed in the course of his existence. There was a snort; perhaps\r\nthat was occasioned by the bugles and heavy brass ornaments which had\r\nadorned the limbs of some Hindoo beauty he had eaten, and which were\r\nlying heavy and indigestible on his stomach. But presently the brute lay\r\nso still, and seemed so tranquil and placid in his sleep, that it was\r\ndifficult to imagine him guilty of such atrocities. He did not appear to\r\nbe disturbed by remorse, or the twitchings of a guilty conscience: it\r\nmay have been all a slander. I felt so kindly disposed toward him, that\r\nI could not imagine it possible that if awake he would feel disposed to\r\neat me. Let us see! so making a splash with my paddle, I wakened the\r\nsleeping beauty. He instantly started up, and opened, what\r\nappeared--what indeed proved to be--an enlarged man-trap; disclosing a\r\nred, slimy cavern within, fringed with great conical fangs. He closed it\r\nwith a snap that made me shudder, and then plunged into the water, his\r\neyes glaring with hate and defiance.\r\n\r\nSome days after I had made this new acquaintance, I was sitting at home\r\ntalking with my brother, when a native woman came crying and screaming\r\nto the bungalow door, tearing her hair out in handfuls; she got down on\r\nthe veranda floor and struck her head against it, as if she really\r\nmeant to dash her brains out. A crowd of other women stood at a short\r\ndistance, crying and lamenting as if they were frantic. What was the\r\nmatter? Half-a-dozen voices made answer in a discordant chorus, that\r\nwhile the poor woman was washing her clothes by the river side, her\r\nchild--an infant about a year old--had been seized and swallowed by a\r\nMugger. Although convinced that aid was now impossible, we took our guns\r\nand hastened to the spot where the accident happened; but all was still\r\nthere, not a wavelet disturbed the surface of the stream. A small\r\nspeckled kingfisher was hovering overhead, as if balanced in the air,\r\nwith its beak bent down on its breast, watching the fish beneath;\r\npresently it darted like an arrow into the water; returned with an empty\r\nbill, and then went off, with its clear, sharp, twittering note, as if\r\nto console itself for the failure.\r\n\r\nOne day I was sitting on the high bank of the river, taking snap shots\r\nwith my gun at the large fish who were every now and then leaping out of\r\nthe water. A favorite spaniel was bringing a fish out of the water that\r\nI had hit. It had swam already half way across the stream, when the\r\nwater about six yards below her became suddenly disturbed; and, to my\r\nhorror, up started the head and open jaws of an enormous crocodile. The\r\ndog gave a loud shriek, and sprang half out of the water. The Mugger\r\nswam rapidly, and had got within a yard of his intended victim, when I\r\nraised my gun, and took aim at the monster's head. A thud, a splash, a\r\nbubble, and a dusky red streak in the water, was all that ensued.\r\nPresently, however, Juno's glossy black head emerged from the water;\r\nand, to my delight, began to make rapid progress toward me, and landed\r\nsafely. The poor brute, wet and shivering, coiled herself up at my feet,\r\nwith her bright hazel eyes fixed on mine with ineffable satisfaction.\r\nPoor Juno subsequently fell a victim to the Muggers, when her master was\r\nnot at hand to succor her. I mention these facts, to show that the\r\ndiabolical revenge with which I afterward assisted in visiting these\r\nmonsters, was not groundless. But the strongest occasion of it remains\r\nto be told.\r\n\r\nJust as the \"rains\" were beginning, my neighbor, Mr. Hall, sent me word\r\nthat he intended paying me a short visit, and requested me to send a\r\n_syce_ (groom), with a saddle-horse, to meet him at a certain place on\r\nthe road. The syce, Sidhoo, was a smart, open-chested, sinewy-limbed\r\nlittle fellow, a perfect model of a biped racer. He could run--as is the\r\ncustom in the East--alongside his horse at a pace of seven or eight\r\nmiles an hour, for a length of time that would astonish the best English\r\npedestrian I ever heard of.\r\n\r\nToward evening, Mr. Hall rode up to the bungalow, dripping with water,\r\nand covered with mud. I saw at once that some accident had happened, and\r\nhastened to assist him.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he got inside, he said, in answer to my bantering about his\r\n\"spill\"--\r\n\r\n\"I am in no humor for jesting. Your syce is lost!\"\r\n\r\n\"Drowned?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; eaten!--by an enormous crocodile!\"\r\n\r\nHe added that, on arriving at a small nulla about two miles off, he\r\nfound it so much swollen by rain, that he had to swim his horse across\r\nit, holding one end of the cord which Sidhoo, in common with most\r\nHindoos, wore coiled round his waist, and which was used in pulling\r\nwater from the deep wells of the country. Hall got safely across, and\r\nthen commenced pulling Sidhoo over by means of the cord. The black face,\r\nwith the white teeth and turban, were bobbing above the muddy water,\r\nwhen all at once the groom threw up his arms, gave a loud shriek, and\r\nsank below the surface. Mr. Hall, who had doubled the cord round his\r\nhand, was dragged into the water; where he got a momentary glimpse of\r\nthe long serrated tail of a Mugger, lashing the water a short way ahead\r\nof him. In his efforts to save himself, he lost his hold of the string,\r\nand with much difficulty clambered up the slippery bank of the nulla.\r\nAll was now still. Only Sidhoo's turban was to be seen floating loosely,\r\na considerable way down the stream. Hall ran toward it, with the sort of\r\nfeeling which makes a drowning man catch at a straw; and, by means of a\r\nstick he succeeded in fishing it out, and brought it with him, as the\r\nonly remnant of Sidhoo he could give an account of.\r\n\r\nBad news soon spreads in an Indian village, and Sidhoo's fate was soon\r\nmade known to his wife; and in a short time she came crying and sobbing\r\nto the bungalow, and laid her youngest child at our friend's feet. The\r\ntears glistened in the poor fellow's eyes as he tried to soothe and\r\nconsole her; which he did by promising to provide for her and her\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nAlthough Hall was generally running over with fun, we smoked our\r\ncheroots that evening in silence; except when we proposed schemes for\r\nthe annihilation of the crocodiles. A great many plans were\r\ndiscussed--but none that offered much chance of success. The next day,\r\nafter breakfast, I was showing my visitor a galvanic blasting apparatus,\r\nlately received from England, for blowing up the snags (stumps of trees)\r\nwhich obstruct the navigation of the river. I was explaining its mode of\r\naction to him, when he suddenly interrupted me--\"The very thing! Instead\r\nof snags, why not blow up the Muggers?\"\r\n\r\nI confessed that there could be no reason why we should not blast the\r\nMuggers. The difficulty was only how to manage it; yet the more we\r\ntalked of it, the more feasible did the scheme appear.\r\n\r\nThe brutes keep pretty constant to the same quarters, when the fish are\r\nplentiful; and we soon ascertained that poor Sidhoo's murderer was well\r\nknown in the neighborhood of the nulla. He had on several occasions\r\ncarried off goats, sheep, pigs, and children; and had once attempted to\r\ndrag a buffalo, whom he had caught drinking, into the water; but, from\r\nall accounts, came off second best in this rencontre. There not being\r\nenough of water in the nulla to drown the buffalo, the Mugger soon found\r\nhe had caught a Tartar; and after being well mauled by the buffalo's\r\nhorns, he was fain to scuttle off and hide himself among the mud.\r\n\r\nI had observed, when blasting the snags, that the concussion produced by\r\nthe discharge had the effect of killing all the fish within a range of\r\nsome twenty or thirty yards. After every explosion, they were found in\r\ngreat numbers, floating on the surface of the water with their bellies\r\nuppermost. It now occurred to me, that if we could only get within a\r\nmoderate distance of the Mugger, if we did not blow him to pieces, we\r\nwould at all events give him a shock that would rather astonish him. An\r\nexplosion of gunpowder under water communicates a much severer shock to\r\nthe objects in its immediate vicinity, than the same quantity of powder\r\nexploded in the air; the greater density of the water enabling it, as it\r\nwere, to give a harder blow.\r\n\r\nHaving made our arrangements, Mr. Hall, my brother, and myself, got into\r\na small canoe, with the blasting apparatus on board, and dropt down the\r\nstream to where the nulla discharged its waters into the Rohan. He then\r\ngot out and proceeded to a village close by, where we obtained for a few\r\nannas, the carcass of a young kid. A flask with about six pounds of\r\ngunpowder, and having the conducting wires attached, was then sewn into\r\nthe kid's belly. Two Strong ropes were also tied to this bait; and, to\r\none of these, the conducting wire was firmly bound with small cord. The\r\nropes were about thirty yards long, and had each attached to its\r\nextremities one of the inflated goat-skins used by water-carriers. Hall,\r\nwith his goat-skin under his arm, and a coil of loose rope in his hand,\r\ntook one side of the nulla, while my brother, similarly provided took\r\nthe other. My brother's rope contained the wire; so I walked beside him,\r\nwhile two coolies, with the battery ready charged, and slung to a pole\r\nwhich rested on their shoulders, accompanied me. A small float was also\r\nattached by a string to the kid, so as to indicate its position.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements being made, we commenced walking up the nulla,\r\ndragging the carcass of the kid in the stream, and moving it across,\r\nfrom side to side, so as to leave no part of the bed untried; and, as\r\nthe nulla was only about twelve yards wide, we felt pretty confident\r\nthat, if the Mugger were in it, we could scarcely fail of coming in\r\ncontact with him. We had proceeded only about a quarter of a mile, when\r\nthe float suddenly dipt. My brother and Hall threw the loose coil of\r\nropes they carried on the water, along with the inflated skins. These\r\nmade it soon evident by their motion that the Mugger had seized the kid.\r\nHe was dashing across, in a zig-zag direction, down the stream. I ran\r\nafter him as fast as I could; and paying out the cord from the reel,\r\nwhen I found it impossible to keep up with him. On reaching a place\r\nwhere the banks were steeper than usual, he came to a stand still. I\r\ngot on the top of the bank, and commenced hauling in the rope. I did\r\nnot, however, venture to lift the skin out of the water, for fear of\r\ndisturbing him, until the coolies with the battery had time to come up.\r\nThis was a very anxious time; for, if the Mugger had shifted his\r\nquarters before they came up, a fresh run with him would have ensued,\r\nwith the chance of his breaking the wires with his teeth. After a while\r\nI heard the coolies approaching, and my brother scolding them, and\r\nurging them to hasten on. Just as their heads appeared above the bank,\r\nthe foremost coolie tripped his foot and fell--I groaned with\r\ndisappointment--presently, my brother came along with them, and brought\r\nthe battery to my feet; a good deal of the acid had been spilt, but,\r\nwith the aid of a bottle of fresh acid we had brought along with us, we\r\nsoon got the battery up to the requisite power. Every thing being now in\r\norder, I commenced pulling up the rope with the wire. I proceeded as\r\ncautiously as possible for fear of disturbing the Mugger; but, in spite\r\nof all my efforts, the inflated skin, in coming up the bank, dislodged\r\nsome loose pieces of earth, and sent them splashing into the water.\r\nFortunately, however, the Mugger had made up his mind to digest the kid\r\nwhere he was. I could not help chuckling when I at length got hold of\r\nthe end of the wires. While my brother was fastening one of them to the\r\nbattery, I got the other ready for completing the circuit. The Mugger\r\nall the while lying still at the bottom of the nulla with, most likely,\r\na couple of fathoms of water over his head, unconscious of danger, and\r\nlittle dreaming that the two-legged creatures on the bank had got a\r\nnerve communicating with his stomach, through which they were going to\r\nsend a flash of lightning that would shatter his scaly hulk to pieces.\r\n\r\nEvery thing being now ready, I made the fatal contact. Our success was\r\ncomplete! We felt a shock, as if something had fallen down the bank--a\r\nmound of muddy water rose, with a muffled, rumbling sound, and then\r\nburst out to a column of dark smoke. A splashing and bubbling succeeded,\r\nand then a great crimson patch floated on the water, like a variegated\r\ncarpet pattern. Strange-looking fragments of scaly skin were picked up\r\nby the natives from the water's edge, and brought to us amidst a very\r\ngeneral rejoicing. The exploded Mugger floated down the stream, and the\r\ncurrent soon carried it out of sight. We were not at all sorry, for it\r\nlooked such a horrible mess that we felt no desire to examine it.\r\n\r\nOur sense of triumphant satisfaction was, however, sadly damped about a\r\nweek afterward, when we received the mortifying announcement, that\r\nSidhoo's Mugger was still alive, and on his old beat, apparently\r\nuninjured. It was evident that we had blasted the wrong Mugger! We\r\nconsoled ourselves with the reflection, that if he were not Sidhoo's\r\nmurderer, it was very _likely_ he was not wholly innocent of other\r\natrocities, and therefore deserved his fate.\r\n\r\nOf course it was impossible to rest while Sidhoo's Mugger remained\r\nalive, so we were not long in preparing for a second expedition. This\r\ntime we took the precaution of not charging the battery until we were\r\ncertain that the bait was swallowed. The acid, diluted to the necessary\r\nstrength, was, therefore, carried in one of those brown earthenware jars\r\ncalled gray-beards, which had come out to us full of Glenlivet whisky.\r\nWe commenced dragging the kid up the stream, as before; but, having\r\nwalked more than a mile without getting a bite, we were getting rather\r\ndisheartened, and sat down to rest, struck a light, and smoked a\r\ncheroot. Hall laid down, having manufactured an impromptu easy chair out\r\nof his coil of rope, with the inflated goat-skin placed above it. My\r\nbrother was not long in imitating his example, and I laid down under the\r\nshade of some reeds, near to the water's edge. The heat was oppressive,\r\nand we were discussing the probability of getting a bite that day, and\r\nlamenting that we had not brought some pale ale along with us, when,\r\nwhen, all at once, I got a sharp blow on the leg, while my brother came\r\nspinning down the bank like a teetotem--a companion picture to Hall; who\r\nwas revolving down the opposite bank. The ropes and skins went rushing\r\ndown the nulla at a tremendous pace. As soon as we recovered from the\r\nlaughter into which we were thrown by this droll contretemps, we set off\r\nin pursuit, guided by the track which the inflated skins made in the\r\nwater. On they went, dashing from side to side, as they had done in our\r\nfirst attempt. On coming to a place where the nulla made a sharp turn,\r\nthey stood still under the high bank, on the inner curve of the bend. It\r\nunfortunately happened that the bank, near to which the skins were\r\nfloating, was too precipitous for us to get near them, without starting\r\nthe Mugger from his present position. With much labor, we detached some\r\nloose sods from the top of the bank, and sent them with a loud splash\r\ninto the water, directly over where we imagined him to have taken up his\r\nquarters. This had the desired effect, for the skins began to move\r\nslowly down the stream, as if the Mugger were crawling leisurely along\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\nLeaving my brother with the coolies in charge of the battery, I ran on\r\nto where the bank was more shelving. By good luck, the stream was\r\nrushing up, after its sudden sweep, and sent a strong current against\r\nthis bank. I had not waited many minutes, before the skins came floating\r\nround the corner, to where I was standing. I seized the one to which the\r\nwire was attached, desiring my brother to charge the battery, and bring\r\nit down. This he did much sooner than I could have expected; for, as the\r\nbattery was now empty, one coolie was able to carry it on his head,\r\nwhile my brother took the jar of acid in his hand. It was evident from\r\nthe motion of the other skin in the water that the Mugger was still\r\nmoving--so no time was to be lost. I made the connection with the\r\nbattery with one of the wires; in another instant the circuit was\r\ncomplete, and the Mugger's doom sealed.\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause--owing, I suppose, to some slight loss of\r\ninsulation in the wires--then came the premonitory shock, then the\r\nrumble, the smoke, and the sparks; and a great bloated mass of flesh and\r\nblood rose to the surface of the water. Hall called out to us to drag it\r\nashore, and see whether we could get any trace of poor Sidhoo. We tried\r\nby means of a bamboo pole to pull it to the bank, but the glimpse we got\r\nof it as it neared was so unutterably disgusting, that we pushed it off\r\nagain, and allowed it to float away down with the current.\r\n\r\nThat this was Sidhoo's Mugger, there could be no doubt; for he was never\r\nseen or heard of in the neighborhood again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER ON DREAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we picture to ourselves a person lying in a state of profound\r\nsleep--the body slightly curved upon itself; the limbs relaxed; the head\r\nreclining on its pillow; and eyelids closed--it is wonderful to think\r\nwhat strange and startling imagery may be passing through the brain of\r\nthat apparently unconscious being. The events of his whole life may\r\nhurry past him in dim obscurity; he may be revisited by the dead; he may\r\nbe transported into regions he never before beheld; and his ideas\r\nvisibly assuming phantasmal shapes, may hover round him like shadows\r\nreflected from another and more spiritual state of existence.\r\n\r\nLet us draw the curtains gently aside, and study the physiognomy of\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThe countenance may, occasionally, be observed lighted up, as it were,\r\nfrom within by a passing dream--its expression is frequently one of\r\npeculiar mildness and benignity; the breathing may be slow, but it is\r\ncalm and uniform: the pulse not so rapid as in the waking state, but\r\nsoft and regular; the composure of the whole body may continue\r\ntrance-like and perfect. There is, indeed, no sign of innocence more\r\ntouching than the smile of a sleeping infant. But, suddenly, this state\r\nof tranquillity may be disturbed; the dreamer changes his position and\r\nbecome restless; he moans grievously--perhaps sobs--and tears may be\r\nobserved glimmering underneath his eyelids; his whole body now seems to\r\nbe shaken by some inward convulsion; but, presently, the strife abates;\r\nthe storm-cloud gradually passes; he stretches his limbs, opens his\r\neyes, and, as he awakes, daylight, in an instant, dispels the vision,\r\nperhaps leaving not behind the faintest trace or recollection of a\r\nsingle incident which occurred in this mysterious state.\r\n\r\nBut what are dreams? Whence come they? What do they portend? Not man\r\nonly, but all animals, it is presumed, dream, more or less, when they\r\nare asleep. Horses neigh, and sometimes kick violently; cows, when\r\nsuckling their young calves, often utter piteous lowings; dogs bark in\r\nsuppressed tones, and, from the motions of their paws, appear to fancy\r\nthemselves in the field of the chase; even frogs, particularly during\r\nsummer, croak loudly and discordantly until midnight, and then retire,\r\nand become silent. Birds also dream; and will sometimes, when\r\nfrightened, fall from their roosting-perch, or flutter about their cage,\r\nin evident alarm. A bullfinch, says Bechstein, belonging to a lady, was\r\nsubject to very frightful dreams, which made it drop off its perch; but\r\nno sooner did it hear the voice of its affectionate mistress than it\r\nbecame immediately tranquil, and reascended its perch to sleep again. It\r\nis pretty certain that parrots dream. It is, indeed, a curious\r\ncircumstance that the best way of teaching this bird to talk is to cover\r\nthe cage over so as to darken it, and while he is going to sleep\r\npronounce, audibly and slowly, the word he is to learn; if the winged\r\npupil be a clever one, he will, upon the repetition of the lesson, in a\r\nmorning or two, begin to repeat it.\r\n\r\nUpon the same principle, school-boys commit their tasks to memory by\r\nreading them over the last thing before they go to bed. It is to be\r\nremembered that during sleep the mind may not be wholly under eclipse;\r\nfor, although some of its faculties--such as perception, comparison,\r\njudgment, and especially the will, may be suspended--others (for\r\nexample, memory and imagination), are often more active than in the\r\nwaking state. But some persons, it is said, never dream. We are assured\r\nby Locke that he knew a gentleman who had an excellent memory, yet could\r\nnot recollect ever having dreamed until his twenty-sixth year. Dr. Reid,\r\nfor many years before his death, had no recollection of having ever\r\ndreamed. Dr. Eliotson also relates, apparently upon good authority, the\r\ncase of a man who never dreamed until after he had a fever, in his\r\nfortieth year; and we ourselves know several persons who are not\r\nconscious of ever dreaming. Nevertheless, many contend that in all such\r\ncases dreams really occur, but that they escape the recollection; for\r\nthey contend that it is impossible that the mind can, being an\r\nindependent principle, ever be in a state of absolute rest. This is\r\narguing within a very narrow circle. We must not forget that the\r\nintimate alliance of the mind with the body, subjects it to its general\r\nlaws; the \"heat-oppressed brain\" requires rest to renew its energies,\r\nand the mind, of which it is the organ, in the mean time, may, as in\r\nprofound sleep, remain perfectly quiescent. The lids of the outward\r\nsenses are closed; a vail is drawn over the immaterial principle of our\r\nnature; and mind and body alike, for a period, lie in a state of utter\r\nunconsciousness.\r\n\r\nHere, however, it may fairly be asked, how happens it that the same\r\nperson will at one time remember, and, at another, forget his dreams?\r\nThis circumstance may, we conceive, thus be explained:\r\n\r\nThose dreams which occur in very deep sleep, and in the early part of\r\nthe night, are not so likely to be remembered as those which happen\r\ntoward morning, when the sleep is less profound; hence the popular\r\nnotion that our morning dreams--which are always best remembered--are\r\nlikely to prove true. Then, again, the imagery of some dreams is more\r\nstriking, and actually makes a deeper impression than the incidents of\r\nother dreams. We are told by Sir Humphrey Davy, that, on one occasion, a\r\ndream was so strongly impressed upon his eye, that even after he had\r\nrisen and walked out, he could not be persuaded of its unreal nature,\r\nuntil his friends convinced him of its impossibility. The effect of some\r\ndreams upon children is very remarkable; they are, it is believed, more\r\nliable to dreams of terror than grown persons, which may be accounted\r\nfor by their being more subject to a variety of internal complaints,\r\nsuch as teething, convulsions, derangement of the bowels, &c.; added to\r\nwhich, their reasoning faculties are not as yet sufficiently developed\r\nto correct such erroneous impressions. Hence, sometimes, children\r\nappear, when they awake, bewildered and distressed, and remain for a\r\nconsiderable period in a state of agitation almost resembling delirium.\r\nThe incidents which are conceived in dreams are indeed not unfrequently\r\nconfounded by adults with real events; hence, we often hear people, in\r\nalluding to some doubtful circumstance, exclaim, \"Well! if it be not\r\ntrue, I certainly must have dreamed it.\" We confess we have ourselves\r\nbeen puzzled in this way; the spell may be broken; but the impression\r\nmade by the delusion still clings to us; its shadow is still thrown\r\nacross our path.\r\n\r\nThe question therefore recurs, What are Dreams? Whence do they arise? We\r\nbelieve that the ideas and emotions which take place in the dreaming\r\nstate may be ascribed to a twofold origin. They may arise from certain\r\nbodily sensations, which may suggest particular trains of thought and\r\nfeeling; or they may be derived from the operations or activity of the\r\nthinking principle itself; in which case they are purely mental. The\r\ncelebrated Dr. James Gregory--whose premature death was a great loss to\r\nscience--states, that having gone to bed with a vessel of hot water at\r\nhis feet, he dreamed of walking up the crater of Mount Etna, and felt\r\nthe ground warm under him. He likewise, on another occasion, dreamed of\r\nspending a winter at Hudson's Bay, and of suffering much distress from\r\nintense frost; and found, when he awoke, that he had thrown off the\r\nbed-clothes in his sleep, and exposed himself to cold. He had been\r\nreading, a few days before, a very particular account of this colony.\r\nThe eminent metaphysician, Dr. Reid, relates of himself that the\r\ndressing of a blister, which he had applied to his head, becoming\r\nruffled, so as to produce pain, he dreamed that he had fallen into the\r\nhands of a party of North American Indians, who were scalping him. These\r\nwere dreams suggested by sensations which, were conveyed from the\r\nsurface of the body, through the nerves, until corresponding impression\r\nwas produced on the mind. Upon the same principle, very strong\r\nimpressions received during the day may modify and very materially\r\ninfluence the character of our dreams at night. Dr. Beattie states that\r\nonce, after riding thirty miles in a very high wind, he passed a night\r\nof dreams which were so terrible, that he found it expedient to keep\r\nhimself awake, that he might no longer be tormented with them. \"Had I\r\nbeen superstitious,\" he observes, \"I should have thought that some\r\ndisaster was impending; but it occurred to me that the tempestuous\r\nweather I had encountered the preceding day might be the cause of all\r\nthese horrors.\" Other and less obvious causes are in constant operation.\r\nA change in the weather--in the electrical state of the atmosphere--and\r\nits barometrical pressure--the temperature of the bedroom--arrangements\r\nof the bed-furniture--the adjustment of the bed-clothes--nay, the\r\nposition of the sleeper, particularly if he cramp a foot or benumb an\r\narm, will at once affect the entire concatenation and issue of his\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, impressions may be made on the mind during sleep, by\r\nspeaking gently to a person, or even whispering in the ear. We\r\nourselves, when in Italy, could on one occasion trace the origin of a\r\nvery remarkable dream to our having heard, in an obscure and\r\nhalf-conscious manner, during sleep, the noise of people in the streets,\r\non All Souls'-night, invoking alms for the dead. Dr. Beattie knew a man\r\nin whom any kind of dream could be produced if his friends, gently\r\naddressing him, afforded the subject-matter for his ideas. Equally\r\ncurious is the circumstance that dreams may be produced by whispering in\r\nthe ear. A case of this description is recorded by Dr. Abercrombie:\r\n\r\n\"An officer, whose susceptibility of having his dreams thus conjured\r\nbefore him, was so remarkable, that his friends could produce any kind\r\nof dream they pleased, by softly whispering in his ear, especially if\r\nthis were done by one with whose voice he was familiar. His companions\r\nwere in the constant habit of amusing themselves at his expense. On one\r\noccasion they conducted him through the whole progress of a quarrel,\r\nwhich ended in a duel; and when the parties were supposed to meet, a\r\npistol was put into his hand, which he fired off in his sleep, and was\r\nawakened by the report. On another, they found him asleep on the top of\r\na locker or bunker in the cabin, when, by whispering, they made him\r\nbelieve he had fallen overboard; and they then exhorted him to save\r\nhimself by swimming. He immediately imitated the motions of swimming.\r\nThey then suggested to him that he was being pursued by a shark, and\r\nentreated him to dive for his life. This he did, or rather attempted,\r\nwith so much violence, that he threw himself off the locker, by which he\r\nwas bruised, and, of course, awakened.\" Dr. Abercrombie adds, that the\r\nmost remarkable circumstance connected with this case was, that after\r\nthese and a variety of other pranks had been played upon him, \"he had\r\nno distinct recollection of his dreams, but only a confused feeling of\r\noppression or fatigue, and used to tell his friends that he was sure\r\nthey had been playing some tricks upon him.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears, also--and the fact is very remarkable--that a similar kind\r\nof sensation will produce the same description of dream in a number of\r\nindividuals at the same time. Hence different people will sometimes have\r\nthe same dream. We read of a whole regiment starting up in alarm,\r\ndeclaring they were dreaming that a black dog had jumped upon their\r\nbreasts and disappeared, which curious circumstance was explained by the\r\ndiscovery, that they had all been exposed to the influence of a\r\ndeleterious gas, which was generated in the monastery. The effect of\r\nmusic, also, in exciting delightful dreams, has often been attested. A\r\nFrench philosopher whose experiments are reported by Magendie, according\r\nto the airs which he had arranged should be played while he was asleep,\r\ncould have the character of his dreams directed at pleasure. \"There is\r\nan art,\" says Sir Thomas Browne--in his usual quaint style--\"to make\r\ndreams as well as their interpretations; and physicians will tell us\r\nthat some food makes turbulent, some gives quiet dreams. Cato, who\r\ndoated upon cabbage, might find the crude effects thereof; and\r\nPythagoras might have had calmer sleeps if he had totally abstained from\r\nbeans.\"\r\n\r\nThe influences of the day's occurrences, and the thoughts which have\r\noccupied the mind during the day, have been said to give a corresponding\r\ntone and coloring to our dreams at night. Thus the lover dreams of his\r\nmistress; the miser of his gold; the merchant of his speculations; the\r\nman of science of his discoveries. The poets of all ages and nations\r\nadopt this view. Virgil describes Dido forsaken by Æneas, wandering\r\nalone on a desert shore in pursuit of the Tyrians. Milton represents Eve\r\nrelating to Adam the dreams which were very naturally the repetition of\r\nher waking thoughts. Petrarch invokes the beauty of Laura. Eloisa,\r\nseparated from Abelard, is again happy in his company, even amid the\r\n\"dreary wastes\" and \"low-browed rocks.\"\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the dreams of many persons are very greatly\r\ninfluenced by the reflections and emotions they have experienced the\r\npreceding day; but this is by no means invariably the case. We have\r\nknown persons whose dreams refer habitually to events which occurred to\r\nthem, perhaps, twenty years ago, and upon whom recent events seem to\r\npossess no such influence. We have often been told by ladies happily and\r\naffectionately married, that while they were engaged, although their\r\nthoughts were naturally much set on their engagement, they never dreamed\r\nof their lovers. So, also, the father of a family, habitually impressed\r\nwith a sense of his responsibility and affection toward his offspring,\r\nwill sometimes dream often enough of his neighbor's children, but\r\nseldom or, perhaps, never, of his own. Try to dream on a given\r\nsubject--resolve and fix the attention upon it--going to sleep, and no\r\nsooner are our eyelids closed, than fantastic fancy will conjure up the\r\nmost opposite and incongruous imagery. We have heard this dream-problem\r\nexplained by referring it to a principle of _antagonism_, which, waking\r\nor sleeping, may be observed in the animal economy. If a limb become\r\nfatigued by remaining too long in one position, it will be relieved by\r\nbeing thrown into the very opposite condition; if the eye fatigue itself\r\nby gazing intently on the disc of any bright color, and the eyelids\r\nclose, the very opposite, or antagonistic color will be depicted upon\r\nthe retina: in like manner, when our waking thoughts--in connection with\r\nthe nerve matter, which is their material instrument--have exhausted\r\ntheir energy, we can easily conceive how the very opposite condition\r\nwill be produced. Hence the most unconnected and preposterous train of\r\nimagery may arise from the very earnestness with which we desire a\r\ncontrary effect. We dream of events which do not concern us, instead of\r\nthose in which we are most deeply interested; we dream of persons to\r\nwhom we are indifferent, instead of those to whom we are attached. But,\r\nin the midst of all this curious and perplexing contrariety, it is\r\nremarkable--and may be esteemed a proof of the immateriality of the\r\nmind--that we always preserve the consciousness of our own identity. No\r\nman dreams that he is a woman, or any other person than himself; we have\r\nheard of persons who have dreamed they were dead, and in a spiritual\r\nstate; but the spirit was still their own--they maintained their\r\nidentity. Sir Thomas Lawrence once made an interesting observation on\r\nthis subject to Mrs. Butler--then Miss Fanny Kemble: he pointed out, in\r\nconversation, that he never heard of any lady who ever dreamed that she\r\nwas younger than she really was. We retain in our dreams even the\r\nidentity of our age. It has been said--we think by Sir Thomas\r\nBrowne--that some persons of virtuous and honorable principles will\r\ncommit, as they fancy, actions in their dreams which they would shudder\r\nat in their waking moments; but we can not believe that the identity of\r\nmoral goodness can be so perverted in the dreaming state. We can,\r\nhowever, readily conceive that, when the mind is oppressed, or disturbed\r\nby the recollection of some event it dreads to dwell upon, it may be\r\ndisturbed by the most terrific and ghastly images. A guilty conscience,\r\ntoo, will unquestionably produce restlessness, agitation, and\r\nawe-inspiring dreams. Hence Manfred, in pacing restlessly his lonely\r\nGothic gallery at midnight, pictures to himself the terrors of sleep:\r\n\r\n    \"The lamp must be replenished; even then\r\n    It will not burn so long as I must watch.\r\n    My slumbers, if I slumber, are not sleep,\r\n    _But a continuance of enduring thought,\r\n    Which then I can resist not. In my heart\r\n    There is a vigil; and these eyes\r\n    But close to look within._\"\r\n\r\nContrition and remorse oppose his rest. If we remember right, it was\r\nBishop Newton who remarked, that the sleep of innocence differed\r\nessentially from the sleep of guilt.\r\n\r\nThe assistance supposed to be sometimes furnished in sleep toward the\r\nsolution of problems which puzzled the waking sense, opens up a curious\r\nsubject of investigation. Cases of the kind have been recorded upon\r\nundoubted authority. Hence some philosophers, like Sir Thomas Browne and\r\nAddison, have been induced to suppose that the soul in this state is\r\npartially disengaged from the encumbrance of the body, and therefore\r\nmore intelligent, which is a mere fancy--a poetical fiction. Surely it\r\nis absurd to suppose that the soul, which we invest with such high and\r\nperfect attributes, should commit such frivolous and irrational acts as\r\nthese which take place so constantly in our dreams. \"Methinks,\" observed\r\nLocke, \"every drowsy nod shakes this doctrine.\" All we remark, is, that\r\nsome of the ordinary mental faculties act in such cases with increased\r\nenergy. But beyond this we can not go. We are informed by Cabains, that\r\nFranklin on several occasions mentioned to him, that he had been\r\nassisted in his dreams on the issue of many affairs in which he was\r\nengaged. So, also, Condillac, while writing his \"Cours d'Etudes,\" states\r\nthat he was frequently obliged to leave a chapter incomplete, and retire\r\nto bed: and that on waking, he found it, on more than one occasion,\r\nfinished in his head. Condorcet, upon leaving his deep and complicated\r\ncalculations unfinished, after having retired to rest, often found their\r\nresults unfolded to him in his dreams. Voltaire assures us that he, like\r\nLa Fontaine, composed verses frequently in his sleep, which he\r\nremembered on awaking. Doctor Johnson states that he once in a dream had\r\na contest of wit with some other person, and that he was very much\r\nmortified by imagining that his opponent had the better of him.\r\nColeridge, in a dream, composed the wild and beautiful poem of \"Kubla\r\nKhan,\" which was suggested to him by a passage he was reading in\r\n\"Purchas's Pilgrimage\" when he fell asleep. On awaking he had a distinct\r\nrecollection of the whole, and, taking his pen, ink, and paper,\r\ninstantly and eagerly wrote down the lines which have been so much\r\nadmired.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking circumstances connected with the human mind is\r\nthe extreme lightning-like rapidity of its thoughts, even in our waking\r\nhours; but the transactions which appear to take place in our dreams are\r\naccomplished with still more incalculable rapidity; the relations of\r\nspace, the duration of time, appear to be alike annihilated; we are\r\ntransported in an instant to the most distant regions of the earth, and\r\nthe events of ages are condensed into the span of a few seconds. The\r\naccidental jarring of a door, or any noise, will, at the same moment, it\r\nawakens a person, suggest the incidents of an entire dream. Hence some\r\npersons--Lord Brougham in particular--have supposed that all our dreams\r\ntake place in the transition or interval between sleep and waking. A\r\ngentleman dreamt that he had enlisted as a soldier, joined his regiment,\r\ndeserted, was apprehended, carried back, tried, condemned to be shot,\r\nand, at last, led out for execution. After all the usual preparations a\r\ngun was fired; he awoke with the report, and found that a noise in an\r\nadjoining room had, in the same moment, produced the dream and awakened\r\nhim. The same want of any notion of the duration of time occurs, more or\r\nless, in all dreams; hence our ignorance when we awake of the length of\r\nthe night. A friend of Doctor Abercrombie's dreamt that he crossed the\r\nAtlantic and spent a fortnight in America. In embarking, on his return,\r\nhe fell into the sea, and, awakening with the fright, discovered he had\r\nnot been ten minutes asleep. \"I lately dreamed,\" says Dr. Macnish, \"that\r\nI made a voyage--remained some days in Calcutta--returned home--then\r\ntook ship for Egypt, where I visited the cataracts of the Nile, Grand\r\nCairo, and the Pyramids; and to crown the whole, had the honor of an\r\ninterview with Mehemet Ali, Cleopatra, and Alexander the Great.\" All\r\nthis was the work of a single hour, or even a few minutes. In one of the\r\ndreams which Mr. De Quincey describes--when under the influence of\r\nopium--\"The sense of Space and in the end of Time were,\" he states,\r\n\"both powerfully affected. Buildings, landscapes, &c., were exhibited in\r\nproportions so vast as the bodily eye is not fitted to receive. Space\r\nswelled, and was amplified to a sense of unutterable infinity. This,\r\nhowever, did not disturb me so much as the vast expansion of Time; I\r\nsometimes seemed to have lived for seventy or one hundred years in one\r\nnight; nay, sometimes had feelings representative of a millenium, passed\r\nin that time; or, however, of a duration far beyond the limits of any\r\nhuman experience.\" One of the miracles of Mohammed appears to be\r\nillustrative of the same phenomenon. We read, in the Koran, that the\r\nangel Gabriel took Mohammed, one morning, out of his bed to give him a\r\nsight of all things in the Seven Heavens and in Paradise; and, after\r\nholding ninety thousand spiritual conferences, he was brought back again\r\nto his bed; all which was transacted in so small a space of time that\r\nMohammed, upon his return, found his bed still warm.\r\n\r\nAre dreams so much varied as is generally supposed? Or, taking into\r\nconsideration our different mental and physical constitutions, is there\r\nnot rather a remarkable sameness in them? It is certainly a very unusual\r\ncircumstance to hear of any dream that does violence to the common\r\nexperience of mankind. One class of dreams, which may be termed\r\nRETROSPECTIVE, is of frequent occurrence. These are characterized by the\r\nrevival of associations long since forgotten. The faculty of Memory\r\nappears to be preternaturally exalted; the vail is withdrawn which\r\nobscured the vista of our past life; and the minutest events of\r\nchildhood pass in vivid review before us. There can be no doubt that\r\nsomething analogous to this occurs in drowning; when, after the alarm\r\nand struggle for life has subsided, sensations and visions supervene\r\nwith indescribable rapidity. The same very remarkable phenomenon takes\r\nplace also sometimes in hanging; but is by no means uniformly produced.\r\n\"Of all whom I have seen restored from drowning,\" observes Dr. Lettsom,\r\n\"I never found one who had the smallest recollection of any thing that\r\npassed under water until the time they were restored.\" Persons must not,\r\ntherefore, be deceived by imagining that an Elysium is to be found at\r\nthe bottom of a garden-well, or a canal, or a river.\r\n\r\nBut to return--it is not only the very early incidents of childhood\r\nwhich may thus be recalled by our dreams, but recent events, which in\r\nour waking hours had escaped the memory, are sometimes suddenly\r\nrecalled. In his \"Notes to Waverley,\" Sir Walter Scott relates the\r\nfollowing anecdote: \"A gentleman connected with a Bank in Glasgow, while\r\nemployed in the occupation of cashier, was annoyed by a person, out of\r\nhis turn, demanding the payment of a check for six pounds. Having paid\r\nhim, but with reluctance, out of his turn, he thought no more of the\r\ntransaction. At the end of the year, which was eight or nine months\r\nafter, a difficulty was experienced in making the books balance, in\r\nconsequence of a deficiency of six pounds. Several days and nights were\r\nexhausted in endeavors to discover the source of the error, but without\r\nsuccess; and the discomfited and chagrined cashier retired one night to\r\nhis bed, disappointed and fatigued. He fell asleep and dreamed he was at\r\nhis Bank, and once again the whole scene of the annoying man and his\r\nsix-pound check arose before him; and, on examination, it was discovered\r\nthat the sum paid to this person had been neglected to be inserted in\r\nthe book of interests, and that it exactly accounted for the error in\r\nthe balance.\" We read of another gentleman, a solicitor, who, on one\r\noccasion, lost a very important document connected with the conveyance\r\nof some property; the most anxious search was made for it in vain; and\r\nthe night preceding the day on which the parties were to meet for the\r\nfinal settlement the son of this gentleman then went to bed, under much\r\nanxiety and disappointment, and dreamt that, at the time when the\r\nmissing paper was delivered to his father, his table was covered with\r\npapers connected with the affairs of a particular client; and there\r\nfound the paper they had been in search of, which had been tied up in a\r\nparcel to which it was in no way related.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of dreams which would appear to be much more\r\nextraordinary than these of a Retrospective Character, to wit: those in\r\nwhich the dreamer appears to take cognizance of incidents which are\r\noccurring at a distance, which may be designated Dreams of COINCIDENCE.\r\nIn the \"Memoirs of Margaret de Valois\" we read, that her mother,\r\nCatherine de Medicis, when ill of the plague at Metz, saw her son, the\r\nDuc d'Anjou, at the victory of Jarnac, thrown from his horse, and the\r\nPrince de Condé dead--events which happened exactly at that moment. Dr.\r\nMacnish relates, as the most striking example he ever met with of the\r\nco-existence between a dream and a passing event, the following\r\nmelancholy story: Miss M., a young lady, a native of Ross-shire, was\r\ndeeply in love with an officer who accompanied Sir John Moore in the\r\nPeninsular War. The constant danger to which he was exposed had an\r\nevident effect upon her spirits. She became pale and melancholy in\r\nperpetually brooding over his fortunes; and, in spite of all that reason\r\ncould do, felt a certain conviction that, when she last parted from her\r\nlover, she had parted with him forever. In a surprisingly short period\r\nher graceful form declined into all the appalling characteristics of a\r\nfatal illness, and she seemed rapidly hastening to the grave, when a\r\ndream confirmed the horrors she had long anticipated, and gave the\r\nfinishing stroke to her sorrows. One night, after falling asleep, she\r\nimagined she saw her lover, pale, bloody, and wounded in the breast,\r\nenter her apartment. He drew aside the curtains of the bed, and, with a\r\nlook of the utmost mildness, informed her that he had been slain in\r\nbattle, desiring her, at the same time, to comfort herself, and not take\r\nhis death too seriously to heart. It is needless to say what influence\r\nthis vision had upon a mind so replete with woe. It withered it\r\nentirely, and the poor girl died a few days afterward, but, not without\r\ndesiring her parents to note down the day of the month on which it\r\nhappened, and see if it would not be confirmed, as she confidently\r\ndeclared it would. Her anticipation was correct, for accounts were\r\nshortly afterward received that the young man was slain at the battle of\r\nCorunna, which was fought on the very day of the night of which his\r\nbetrothed had beheld the vision. It is certainly very natural to suppose\r\nthat there must be some mysterious connection between such a dream and\r\nthe event which appears to have simultaneously taken place--but, upon\r\nreflecting further upon the subject, we shall find that the co-existence\r\nis purely accidental. If, as Sir Walter Scott observed, any event, such\r\nas the death of the person dreamt of, chance to take place, so as to\r\ncorrespond with the nature and time of the apparition, the circumstance\r\nis conceived to be supernatural, although the coincidence is one which\r\nmust frequently occur, since our dreams usually refer to the\r\naccomplishment of that which haunts our minds when awake, and often\r\npresage the most probable events. Such a concatenation, therefore, must\r\noften take place when it is considered \"of what stuff dreams are made,\"\r\nand how naturally they turn upon those who occupy our mind when awake.\r\nWhen a soldier is exposed to death in battle; when a sailor is incurring\r\nthe dangers of the sea; when a beloved wife or relative is attacked by\r\ndisease, how readily our sleeping imagination rushes to the very point\r\nof alarm which, when waking, it had shuddered to anticipate. Considering\r\nthe many thousands of dreams which must, night after night, pass\r\nthrough the imagination of individuals, the number of coincidences\r\nbetween the vision and the event are fewer and less remarkable than a\r\nfair calculation of chance would warrant us to expect.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, we sometimes hear of dreams which appear to reveal\r\nthe secrets of futurity; and which may be designated PROPHETIC\r\nDreams--unvailing, as they are supposed to do, the destiny which awaits\r\nparticular individuals. The prophetic dream of Cromwell, that he should\r\nlive to be the greatest man in England, has often been referred to as an\r\nexample of special revelation; but surely there can be nothing very\r\nwonderful in the occurrence--for, after all, if we could only penetrate\r\ninto the thoughts, hopes, and designs which inflamed the ambition of\r\nsuch men as Ireton, Lambert, and the like, we should find both their\r\nwaking and sleeping visions equally suggestive of self-aggrandizement.\r\nThe Protector himself was not the only usurper, in those troubled times,\r\nwho dreamed of being \"every inch a king;\" but we want the data to\r\ncompute the probabilities which the laws of chance would give in favor\r\nof such a prophecy or dream being fulfilled. The prophetic dream refers\r\ngenerally to some event which, in the course of nature, is likely to\r\nhappen: is it, then, wonderful that it should occur? It would be curious\r\nto know how often Napoleon dreamed that he was the Emperor of the\r\ncivilized world, or confined as a prisoner of war; how many thrones he\r\nimagined himself to have ascended or abdicated; how often he\r\naccomplished the rebuilding of Jerusalem. A few years ago, some very\r\ncruel murders were perpetrated in Edinburgh, by men named Burke and\r\nHare, who sold the bodies of their victims to the Anatomical Schools. We\r\nhad ourselves an interview with Burke, after his condemnation, when he\r\ntold us that many months before he was apprehended and convicted, he\r\nused to dream that the murders he committed had been discovered; then he\r\nimagined himself going to be executed, and his chief anxiety was, how he\r\nshould comport himself on the scaffold before the assembled multitude,\r\nwhose faces he beheld gazing up and fixed upon him. His dream was, in\r\nevery respect, verified; but who, for an instant, would suppose there\r\ncould have been any thing preternatural, or prophetic, in such a vision?\r\nFor the most part, dreams of this description are supposed to portend\r\nthe illness, or the time of the death, of particular individuals; and\r\nthese, too, upon the simple doctrine of chance, turn out, perhaps, to be\r\nas often wrong as right. It may be true, that Lord Lyttleton died at the\r\nexact hour which he said had been predicted to him in a dream; but\r\nVoltaire outlived a similar prophecy for many years. It must, however,\r\nbe conceded, that persons in ill-health may have their death expedited\r\nby believing in such fatal predictions. Tell a timorous man that he will\r\ndie; and the sentence, if pronounced with sufficient solemnity, and the\r\nsemblance of its fore-knowledge, will, under certain circumstances,\r\nexecute itself. But, on the other hand, the self-sustaining power of the\r\nwill, with a corresponding concentration of nervous energy, will\r\nsometimes triumph over the presence of disease, and for awhile ward off\r\neven the hand of death. The anecdote is told of Muley Moloch, who, being\r\ninformed that his army was likely to be defeated, sprang from his sick\r\nbed in great excitement, led his men on to victory, and, on returning to\r\nhis tent, lay down and almost instantly expired.\r\n\r\nBut again it may be asked--what then do dreams portend? Do they admit of\r\nany rational interpretation? This branch of the art of divination, which\r\nwas called formerly by the name of \"Oneiromancy,\" has been practiced in\r\nall ages; and there is, perhaps, not a village in Great Britain, or on\r\nthe great continent of Europe, India, or America, in which some\r\nfortune-telling old woman will not be found who professes to be an\r\noracle in propounding their mystical signification. The magicians of old\r\nwere supposed to be skillful interpreters of dreams, which, like the\r\nwiseacres of Christendom, they viewed under very contradictory aspects.\r\n\r\nFrom one of the most ancient Arabic manuscripts on the subject, we learn\r\nthat if you see an angel, it is a good sign; but if you dream that you\r\nconverse with one, it forebodes evil--to dream you bathe in a clear\r\nfountain denotes joy--but if it be muddy, an enemy will bring against\r\nyou some false accusation. To dream of carrying any weight upon the back\r\ndenotes servitude, if you are rich--honor if you are poor. There is not\r\nan object in nature--not an event that can occur in life--that our\r\nmodern fortune-tellers have not converted, when seen in a dream, into\r\nsome sign ominous of good or of evil; and many even well-educated\r\npersons are in the habit of fostering their credulity by attaching an\r\nundue importance to their dreams. It is a curious circumstance, however,\r\nwhich militates against this mystic art, that the same sign in different\r\ncountries carries with it a very contrary signification. The peasant\r\ngirl in England thinks, if she dream of a rose, that it is a sure sign\r\nof happiness; but the _paysanne_ in Normandy believes that it portends\r\nvexation and disappointment. The Englishman conceives that to dream of\r\nan oak-tree is a sign of prosperity; but in Switzerland, the same vision\r\nis thought to be a forewarning of some dreadful calamity.\r\n\r\nThe domestic superstitions which are connected with dreams, are\r\nsometimes favored by, and perhaps dependent upon a certain morbid\r\ncondition or irritability of the nervous system, which suggests the\r\ndread of some impending calamity, a painful and indefinite sense of\r\napprehension for which no ostensible reason can be assigned. Strange as\r\nit might appear, the influence of our dreams upon our waking state is\r\nvery remarkable; we may awaken refreshed from a dream which has made us,\r\nin our sleep, superlatively happy; or we may rise with melancholic\r\nfeelings after suffering intense affliction in some dream, and the\r\ndetails of both dreams may alike be forgotten. We can not, after being\r\nso much disturbed, at once regain our composure; the billows continue\r\nheaving after the tempest has subsided; the troubled nerves continue to\r\nvibrate after the causes that disturbed them have ceased to act; the\r\nimpression still remains, and checkers the happiness of the future day.\r\nEven men of strong mind, who do not believe in the interpretation of\r\ndreams, may be so affected. When Henry the Fourth of France was once\r\ntold by an astrologer that he would be assassinated, he smiled at the\r\nprediction, and did not believe it; but he confessed that it often\r\nhaunted him afterward, and although he placed no faith in it, still it\r\nsometimes depressed his spirits, and he often expressed a wish that he\r\nhad never heard it. In like manner, dreams, which persons do not believe\r\nin, will unconsciously affect the tenor of their thoughts and feelings.\r\n\r\nThere are many persons who appear to have habitually the most\r\nextraordinary dreams, and there is scarcely a family circle that\r\nassemble round the domestic hearth, in which some one or other of the\r\nparty is not able to relate some very wonderful story. We have,\r\nourselves, a _répertoire_, from which we could select a host of such\r\nnarrations; but we have preferred, at the risk of being thought\r\nrecapitulative, to dwell upon those which have been recorded upon\r\nunimpeachable authority. The dreams which men like Locke, Reid, Gregory,\r\nAbercrombie, Macnish, &c., have attested, come with a weight of evidence\r\nbefore us which the dreams of persons unknown in the scientific or\r\nliterary world would not possess. The impressions produced by dreams are\r\nso fugitive--so easy is it for persons unintentionally to deceive\r\nthemselves in recalling their dreams' experience--that Epictetus, long\r\nago, advised young men not to entertain any company by relating their\r\ndreams, as they could only, he affirmed, be interesting to themselves,\r\nand perhaps would, after all their pains, be disbelieved by their\r\nauditors. Nevertheless, it would be well for all persons to study,\r\nwhether waking or dreaming, the phenomena of their own minds. The\r\ningenious naturalist, Doctor Fleming, suggests that persons should, in\r\ncontra-distinction to a \"Diary,\" keep a \"Nocturnal,\" in which they\r\nshould register their dreams. Doubtless such a journal might turn out to\r\nbe a very amusing psychological record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FAIR IN MUNICH.\r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder when there is not a fair in Munich. This, however, was _Die\r\nDrei Könige Dult_, or the Fair of the Three Kings. By way of amusement,\r\nI thought I would go to it; but as I could not very well go alone, I\r\ninvited Madame Thekla to accompany me, with which she was very well\r\npleased, as I promised to treat her to the shows. As far as buying and\r\nselling, and the crowds of peasants, and townspeople, and students, and\r\nsoldiers, go, it was like any other fair. At a little distance from the\r\nlong array of booths, stood the shows--and thither we bent our steps.\r\n\r\nThe first thing we came upon was a small ladder-wagon, covered with an\r\narched awning; and, bound to one side of the wagon, were tall poles,\r\nfrom which floated a series of ghastly pictures--hideous\r\nraw-head-and-bloody-bone pictures! There were murders, executions,\r\nbe-headings in German fashion; the criminal extended on a horrid sort of\r\nrack, and his head being chopped off by a grim executioner, with a\r\nsword, while a priest stood by in his long robes; there were houses on\r\nfire; drownings, miraculous escapes; there were tall, smirking hussars,\r\nand weeping ladies in white--heroes and heroines in these bloody\r\nhistories!\r\n\r\nThe subjects, the hideous drawing, the hard outlines, the goggle-eyes,\r\nthe blood, the knives, the very fire, made you feel sick. A considerable\r\ncrowd was collected, and listened breathlessly to the sounds of an\r\norgan, to which two Tyrolians sang their appalling tragedies. They sang\r\nin such clear, sweet, mountain tones, that you were strangely\r\nfascinated. Mournfully sang they, in a monotonous chaunt, of blood, and\r\ncrime, and terror, till you felt your blood creep; and, by a frightful\r\nfascination, your eyes gloated on the disgusting pictures.\r\n\r\nWhat a terribly immoral influence must such exhibitions have upon such\r\nan uneducated crowd as surrounded these sirens! Why should not a\r\n_paternal_ government, which guards its people from immoral books and\r\ndisgusting newspapers, not guard them equally from such a disgusting\r\nsight and sound as this Tyrolian exhibition? These Tyrolians sold\r\nprinted histories of the fearful crimes and calamities which were\r\ndepicted on their banners. These histories are very exciting and\r\nromantic reading, as you may believe when I give some of their\r\ntitles:--\"The History of the Great and Terrible Monster, who cruelly\r\nmurdered his Beloved, his Child, his Father, his Mother, his two\r\nSisters, and his Brother, on the 8th of July, 1850.\" \"Heroic\r\nSelf-sacrifice of a Bohemian Hussar Officer, and the Punishment of his\r\nMurderers.\" \"A true and dreadful History which occurred on the 14th of\r\nMarch, 1850, in Schopka, near Milineck, in Bohemia.\" \"The Might of\r\nMutual Love: a highly remarkable event, which occurred at Thoulon, in\r\nthe year 1849.\" \"The Cursed Mill: a Warning from Real Life.\" \"The\r\nTemptation; the Deed; the Consequences!\"\r\n\r\nIf you care to know any thing of the style of these remarkable\r\nproductions, I will give you a specimen. One begins thus:--\"In\r\nRoss-dorf, in Hanover, lived the criminal Peter Natzer. He was by trade\r\na glazier, his father having followed the same calling. Peter was\r\nfive-and-twenty years old, and was, from his earliest youth, addicted to\r\nevery species of crime. He had a sweetheart, named Lucie Braun, a poor\r\ngirl, &c., &c.\"\r\n\r\nAgain:--\"Silent sat the miller, Leverm, in his garden; thoughtfully\r\ngazed he into the distant valley. He was scarcely thirty years of age,\r\nbut heavy cares had bowed him, and robbed him of his fresh, youthful\r\nbloom. Beside him sat his wife, who cast many an anxious but\r\naffectionate glance on her husband. How tender and lovely was this young\r\nwife! The inhabitants of the neighborhood called her 'The Rose of the\r\nValley.'\" In this way begins a most awful tragedy.\r\n\r\nOf course we did not read these things in the fair. It was enough for\r\nus, there, to listen to the mournful chant of the mountaineers, till our\r\nblood was frozen in our veins. I took home with me these printed\r\nhistories, as many another simple soul did; and now, after I have read\r\nthem, and been filled with horror and disgust by them, I have put them\r\naway from me as unholy things. But think of the effect they will have in\r\nmany a lonely village, this winter--in many a desolate farm-house or\r\ncottage--on the wide plain, or among the mountains! These papers are\r\nproductive seeds of murder and crime; of that one may be certain.\r\n\r\nThe next wonder that stopped us in the fair, was a little fat man, who\r\nwas shouting away at the top of his voice, while he briskly sharpened a\r\nknife on a long, rough board, which was smeared over with a black\r\nointment. He was a vender of magical strop-salve! something in the\r\nfashion of Mechi. \"Ladies and gentlemen;\" shouted he, \"witness my\r\nwonderful invention! The dullest knife, stick-knife, bread-knife,\r\nclasp-knife, table-knife, carving-knife, shaving-knife,\r\n(_rasier-messer_) pen-knife, pruning-knife, though dull as this\r\nknife--_though dull as this knife_!\" and here he began hacking away upon\r\nthe edge of a big knife with a strong piece of broken pitcher. \"Yes,\r\nthough dull, dull, dull as this knife!--when subjected to my wonderful\r\nsalve,\" and here he smeared it with his black ointment, \"will cut a\r\nhair, or the most delicate shaving of paper--as it now does!\" and with\r\nthat he severed paper shavings as if they had been nothing. If it was\r\nreally the _same knife_, his was a wonderful invention, and beat Mechi\r\nhollow.\r\n\r\nNext, I had my fortune told at three different places, for six\r\nkreutzers, or two-pence each, and as I was promised pretty much the same\r\nfortune by all, I suppose I ought to believe in the truth of it. They\r\nforetold me lots of trouble in the way of love-crosses, false friends,\r\nand unkind relations, and such small trifles; but were equally liberal\r\nof rich lovers, and plenty of them, plenty of money, and a good husband\r\nto crown all, and good children to be the _props_ of my old age; so I\r\nthink I had, after all, a good sixpenny-worth.\r\n\r\nNext we came upon a little caravan, on the steps of which vociferated a\r\nmost picturesque Tyrolian, in broad-brimmed sugar-loafed hat, adorned\r\nwith chamois hair, and eagles' feathers; in broad-ribbed stockings, and\r\nwith a broad, gayly-embroidened band round his waist, which half covered\r\nhis chest. He assured the crowd below that there was not in the whole\r\nof Bavaria, any thing half as interesting, half as extraordinary, half\r\nas astounding as the singularly gifted, singularly beautiful, singularly\r\nintellectual being within; a being from another quarter of the globe, a\r\nbeing adapted to an entirely different mode of existence to ours; a\r\nbeing who could see in the dark, a being who only lived upon raw meat! A\r\nwonderful Albino who could speak the German tongue!\r\n\r\nOf course we must see the Albino; so in we went, and some way or other I\r\nfelt an unusual shock. There he sat, in a black velvet dress spangled\r\nwith silver, the light coming in from the top of the caravan, and his\r\ntransparent complexion, his burning, fiery eyes, like carbuncles, his\r\nlong waves of white, silky hair, and his long, curling, snow-white,\r\nsilky beard, gave him the appearance of some enchanted dwarf--some\r\ncobold or gnome out of a subterranean palace.\r\n\r\nBut I had not much time to lose myself in dreams about enchanted dwarfs\r\nor gnomes, for there was something else burning in the caravan besides\r\nthe Albino's eyes, and that was Madame Thekla's grand silk cloak! She\r\nhad come out with me in all her grandeur; and now, while we stood\r\nenchanted before the Albino, her fine silk cloak was singeing at a\r\nlittle iron stove that stood behind the door. Poor Madame Thekla! Out we\r\nrushed, and she revenged herself by vociferating to the crowd outside,\r\nas the Tyrolian had done just before, and by exhibiting her unlucky\r\ncloak in a sort of savage despair.\r\n\r\nAn hour afterward, we again passed the caravan, and the Tyrolian in the\r\nribbed stockings was again holding forth on the steps, when, at sight of\r\nus, he interrupted his oration, and politely invited us to re-enter, and\r\ncomplete, _free of cost_, our inspection of the Albino. But Madame\r\nThekla, pointing with stern dignity to her cloak, declined, and marched\r\non.\r\n\r\nAfter this we went to the _wäffeln_-booths, were we ate hot-baked\r\n_wäffeln_, a kind of gofre cake; and then, resisting a wonderful\r\nelephant show, we hastened to the monkey theatre, the poor elephant's\r\nrival exhibition; the \"Grand Monkey Theatre from Paris,\" in which\r\nforty-two apes and poodles, the property of M. Le Cerf, would exhibit\r\nthe most wonderful and artistic feats.\r\n\r\nWe had to wait some time till the four o'clock performance was over,\r\nwhich unfortunately had begun before we arrived; and while Madame Thekla\r\nand I stood impatiently waiting in the cold, up there came a merry-faced\r\nlad of about ten, and began, in great glee, to describe to us the\r\nglorious things that were performed by those \"dear little monkeys and\r\ndogs.\" He was quite eloquent in his delight; and, \"Oh!\" said he, \"if I\r\nhad but another _sechser_ (twopenny-piece), wouldn't I see it again!\"\r\n\"There is another _sechser_, then!\" said I, and put one into his fat\r\nlittle hand. What an astonished, bright face looked up into mine; and he\r\nseized my hand in both his, and shook it almost off. And away he ran up\r\nthe steps for his ticket, flying down again to us, and keeping as close\r\nto us as possible, talking all the time, and fairly dancing for joy.\r\n\r\n\"You've quite bewitched that little fellow,\" said Madame Thekla; and I\r\nseemed to have bewitched all the little lads in the fair, for, by a\r\nstrangely-mysterious power, they were drawn toward us in crowds, from\r\nall hands--little fellows in blouses, little fellows in little green and\r\nbrown surtouts, little fellows in old-fashioned and, in England, almost\r\nforgotten, buttoned-up suits--and all crept bashfully toward us! Oh, the\r\nwonderful magic of a twopenny-piece! Heaven only knows how the news of\r\nthis munificent gift of a _sechser_ had so swiftly spread through the\r\nfair! One little lad actually had the bravery to say to me that\r\n\"children were admitted at half-price!\" And was I not a cold-hearted\r\nwretch to reply, \"Oh, indeed!\" just as though it were a matter of\r\nperfect indifference to me, though, in truth, it was not; but I felt\r\nrather appalled at the sight of such a crowd of little eager heads, well\r\nknowing that my purse was not full to overflowing, even with\r\ntwopenny-pieces!\r\n\r\nAt length we were seated in the little theatre; and, after a fearful\r\ncharivari from the orchestra, the curtain drew up, and we beheld, seated\r\nat a long table, a company of monkeys! It was a _table d'hôte_. A\r\ndandified young fellow--perhaps Monsieur Le Cerf himself--in the most\r\nelegant of cravats, the most elegant white wristbands, the most elegant\r\nring, and the most elegant moustache, performed the part of host; the\r\nwaiter and waitress were monkeys. The waiter--a most drunken,\r\ngood-for-nothing waiter he seemed--a fat, big ape--drank behind the\r\nbacks of the guests the very wine he was serving them with; he seemed so\r\nvery tipsy, that he could hardly walk; he staggered backward and\r\nforward, and leaned against the wall for support, as he emptied the\r\nbottle he was bringing for the company. But the little waitress! She was\r\na little darling; the tiniest of little monkeys, and she came skipping\r\non the stage in a little broad-brimmed straw hat, and a bright-colored\r\nlittle dress, with the daintiest of little white muslin aprons on; she\r\nlooked just like a little fairy. Every body was enchanted with her. Even\r\nMonsieur Le Cerf himself caressed her, and gave her not only, every now\r\nand then, a nut, but a kiss. She behaved beautifully. But as to the\r\nguests! They quarreled, and even fought--Monsieur Le Cerf said it was\r\nabout paying the bill.\r\n\r\nI can't pretend to tell you half the clever things the monkeys did in\r\nthe way of swinging, dancing, firing off muskets, riding on a pony, &c.\r\nWonderful things, too, were performed by the dogs, splendid spaniels and\r\nsetters. One large black-and-tan creature walked on his fore-legs, in\r\nthe style of what children call \"playing at a wheelbarrow,\" only he\r\nhimself, poor wretch, had to wheel the barrow. He walked demurely round\r\nand round the stage, carrying his two unlucky hind-legs up in the air;\r\nthen he walked on three legs, and then, the most difficult task of all\r\nfor a dog, as we were assured, upon two legs on the same side. Another\r\nbeautiful white spaniel came walking in most grandly on her hind legs,\r\nas _Madame de Pompadour_, in a long-trained dress which was borne by a\r\ntiny monkey in livery, bearing a little lantern in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe finale was the besieging of a fortress; and to see some twenty\r\nmilk-white spaniels rushing up and down the stairs of the burning\r\nfortress, illumined by brilliant rose-colored, green, and blue lights,\r\nwas very curious indeed. If I could have forgotten the terrible training\r\nthrough which these poor creatures must have gone, I should have enjoyed\r\nit much more. But I did not wonder, after seeing all their feats, that\r\nour little friend had been so enchanted. He sat behind us in the\r\nhalf-price seats, but for all that we continued to exchange many smiling\r\nglances during the performance. I only wished I could have seen a whole\r\nrow of little fellows all equally delighted and surprised by their good\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIFE'S STRATAGEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Marmaduke Smith, is--judging from his present mundane,\r\nmatter-of-fact character, about the last man one would suspect of having\r\nbeen at any time of his life a victim to the \"tender passion.\" A\r\nrevelation he volunteered to two or three cronies at the club the other\r\nevening undeceived us. The captain on this occasion, as was generally\r\nthe case on the morrow of a too great indulgence, was somewhat dull\r\nspirited and lachrymose. The weather, too, was gloomy; a melancholy\r\nbarrel-organ had been droning dreadfully for some time beneath the\r\nwindows; and to crown all, Mr. Tape, who has a quick eye for the\r\nsentimental, had discovered, and read aloud, a common, but sad story of\r\nmadness and suicide in the evening paper. It is not, therefore, so\r\nsurprising that tender recollections should have revived with unusual\r\nforce in the veteran's memory.\r\n\r\n\"You would hardly believe it, Tape,\" said Captain Smith, after a dull\r\npause, and emitting a sound somewhat resembling a sigh, as he re-lighted\r\nthe cigar which had gone out during Mr. Tape's reading--\"you would\r\nhardly believe it, perhaps; but I was woman-witched once myself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" exclaimed the astonished gentleman whom he addressed. \"A man of\r\nyour strength of mind, captain? I can't believe it; it's impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's an extraordinary fact, I admit; and, to own the truth, I have\r\nnever been able to account exactly for it myself. Fortunately, I took\r\nthe disorder as I did the measles--young; and neither of these\r\ncomplaints is apt to be so fatal then, I'm told, as when they pick a man\r\nup later in life. It was, however, a very severe attack while it lasted.\r\nA very charming hand at hooking a gudgeon was that delightful Coralie\r\nDufour, I _must_ say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any relation to the Monsieur and Madame Dufour we saw some years ago in\r\nParis?\" asked Tape. \"The husband, I remember, was remarkably fond of\r\nexpressing his gratitude to you for having once wonderfully carried him\r\nthrough his difficulties.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Smith looked sharply at Mr. Tape, as if he suspected some\r\nlurking irony beneath the bland innocence of his words. Perceiving, as\r\nusual, nothing in the speaker's countenance, Mr. Smith--blowing at the\r\nsame time a tremendous cloud to conceal a faint blush which, to my\r\nextreme astonishment, I observed stealing over his unaccustomed\r\nfeatures--said, gravely, almost solemnly: \"You, Mr. Tape are a married\r\nman, and the father of a family, and your own experience, therefore, in\r\nthe female line must be ample for a lifetime; but you, sir,\" continued\r\nthe captain, patronizingly, addressing another of his auditors, \"are, I\r\nbelieve, as yet 'unattached,' in a legal sense, and may therefore derive\r\nprofit, as well as instruction, from an example of the way in which\r\nardent and inexperienced youth is sometimes entrapped and bamboozled by\r\nwomankind. Mr. Tape, oblige me by touching the bell.\"\r\n\r\nThe instant the captain's order had been obeyed, he commenced the\r\nnarrative of his love adventure, and for a time spoke with his\r\naccustomed calmness: but toward the close he became so exceeding\r\ndiscursive and excited, and it was with so much difficulty we drew from\r\nhim many little particulars it was essential to hear, that I have been\r\ncompelled, from regard to brevity as well as strict decorum, to soften\r\ndown and render in my own words some of the chief incidents of his\r\nmishap.\r\n\r\nJust previous to the winter campaign which witnessed the second siege\r\nand fall of Badajoz, Mr. Smith, in the zealous exercise of his perilous\r\nvocation, entered that city in his usual disguise of a Spanish\r\ncountryman, with strict orders to keep his eyes and ears wide open, and\r\nto report as speedily as possible upon various military details, which\r\nit was desirable the British general should be made acquainted with. Mr.\r\nSmith, from the first moment the pleasant proposition was hinted to him,\r\nhad manifested considerable reluctance to undertake the task; more\r\nespecially as General Phillipon, who commanded the French garrison, had\r\nnot very long before been much too near catching him, to render a\r\npossibly still more intimate acquaintance with so sharp a practitioner\r\nat all desirable. Nevertheless, as the service was urgent, and no one,\r\nit Was agreed, so competent as himself to the duty--indeed upon this\r\npoint Mr. Smith remarked that the most flattering unanimity of opinion\r\nwas exhibited by all the gentlemen likely, should he decline the honor,\r\nto be selected in his place--he finally consented and in due time found\r\nhimself fairly within the walls of the devoted city. \"It was an\r\nuncomfortable business,\" the captain said, \"very much so--and in more\r\nways than one. It took a long time to accomplish; and what was worse\r\nthan all, rations were miserably short. The French garrison were living\r\nupon salted horse-flesh, and you may guess, therefore, at the condition\r\nof the civilians' victualing department. Wine was, however, to be had in\r\nsufficient plenty; and I used frequently to pass a few hours at a place\r\nof entertainment kept by an Andalusian woman, whose bitter hatred of the\r\nFrench invaders, and favorable disposition toward the British were well\r\nknown to me, though successfully concealed from Napoleon's soldiers,\r\nmany of whom--sous-officiers chiefly--were her customers. My chief\r\namusement there was playing at dominoes for a few glasses. I played,\r\nwhen I had a choice, with a smart, goodish-looking sous-lieutenant of\r\nvoltigeurs--a glib-tongued chap, of the sort that tell all they know,\r\nand something over, with very little pressing. His comrades addressed\r\nhim as Victor, the only name I then knew him by. He and I became very\r\ngood friends, the more readily that I was content he should generally\r\nwin. I soon reckoned Master Victor up; but there was an old, wiry\r\n_gredin_ of a sergeant-major sometimes present, whose suspicious manner\r\ncaused me frequent twinges. One day especially I caught him looking at\r\nme in a way that sent the blood galloping through my veins like\r\nwildfire. A look, Mr. Tape, which may be very likely followed in a few\r\nminutes afterward by a halter, or by half-a-dozen bullets through one's\r\nbody, is apt to excite an unpleasant sensation.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think so. I wouldn't be in such a predicament for the\r\ncreation.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a situation that would hardly suit you, Mr. Tape,\" replied the\r\nveteran, with a grim smile. \"Well, the gray-headed old fox followed up\r\nhis look with a number of interesting queries concerning my birth,\r\nparentage, and present occupation, my answers to which so operated upon\r\nhim, that I felt quite certain when he shook hands with me, and\r\nexpressed himself perfectly satisfied, and sauntered carelessly out of\r\nthe place,-that he was gone to report his surmises, and would be\r\nprobably back again in two twos with a file of soldiers and an order for\r\nmy arrest. He had put me so smartly through my facings, that although it\r\nwas quite a cold day for Spain, I give you my honor I perspired to the\r\nvery tips of my fingers And toes. The chance of escape was, I felt,\r\nalmost desperate. The previous evening a rumor had circulated that the\r\nBritish general had stormed Ciudad Rodrigo, and might therefore be\r\nalready hastening in his seven-league boots, toward Badajoz. The French\r\nwere consequently more than ever on the alert, and keen eyes watched\r\nwith sharpened eagerness for indications of sympathy or correspondence\r\nbetween the citizens and the advancing army. I jumped up as soon as the\r\nsergeant-major had disappeared, and was about to follow, when the\r\nmistress of the place approached, and said, hastily, 'I have heard all,\r\nand if not quick, you will be sacrificed by those French dogs: this\r\nway.' I followed to an inner apartment, where she drew from a\r\nwell-concealed recess, a French officer's uniform, complete. 'On with\r\nit!' she exclaimed, as she left the room. 'I know the word and\r\ncountersign.' I did not require twice telling, you may be sure; and in\r\nless than no time was togged off beautifully in a lieutenant's uniform,\r\nand walking at a smart pace toward one of the gates. I was within twenty\r\nyards of the corps-de-garde, when whom should I run against but\r\nSous-lieutenant Victor! He stared, but either did not for the moment\r\nrecognize me, or else doubted the evidence of his own senses. I\r\nquickened my steps--the guard challenged--I gave the words, 'Napoleon,\r\nAusterlitz!'--passed on; and as soon as a turn of the road hid me from\r\nview, increased my pace to a run. My horse, I should have stated, had\r\nbeen left in sure hands at about two miles' distance. Could I reach so\r\nfar, there was, I felt, a chance. Unfortunately, I had not gone more\r\nthan five or six hundred yards, when a hubbub of shouts, and\r\nmusket-shots in my rear, announced that I was pursued. I glanced round;\r\nand I assure you, gentlemen, I have seen in my life many pleasanter\r\nprospects than met my view--Richmond Hill, for instance, on a fine\r\nsummer day. Between twenty and thirty voltigeurs, headed by my friend\r\nVictor, who had armed himself, like the others, with a musket, were in\r\nfull pursuit; and once, I was quite satisfied, within gun-shot, my\r\nbusiness would be very effectually; and speedily settled.\r\n\r\n\"I ran on with eager desperation: and though gradually neared by my\r\nfriends, gained the hut where I had left the horse in safety. The\r\nvoltigeurs were thrown out for a few minutes They knew, however, that I\r\nhad not passed the thickish clumps of trees which partially concealed\r\nthe cottage; and they extended themselves in a semi-circle to inclose,\r\nand thus make sure of their prey. Juan Sanchez, luckily for himself, was\r\nnot at home; but my horse, as I have stated, was safe, and in prime\r\ncondition for a race. I saddled, bridled, and brought him out, still\r\nconcealed by the trees and hut from the French, whose exulting shouts,\r\nas they gradually closed upon the spot, grew momently louder and\r\nfiercer. The sole desperate chance left was to dash right through them;\r\nand I don't mind telling you, gentlemen, that I was confoundedly\r\nfrightened, and that but for the certainty of being instantly\r\nsacrificed, without benefit of clergy, I should have surrendered at\r\nonce. There was, however, no time for shilly-shallying. I took another\r\npull at the saddle-girths, mounted, drove the only spur I had time to\r\nstrap on sharply into the animal's flank, and in an instant broke cover\r\nin full and near view of the expecting and impatient voltigeurs; and a\r\nvery brilliant reception they gave me--quite a stunner in fact! It's a\r\nvery grand thing, no doubt, to be the exclusive object of attention to\r\ntwenty or thirty gallant men, but so little selfish, gentlemen, have I\r\nbeen from my youth up ward in the article of 'glory,' that I assure you\r\nI should have been remarkably well-pleased to have had a few\r\ncompanions--the more the merrier--to share the monopoly which I\r\nengrossed as I came suddenly in sight. The flashes, reports, bullets,\r\n_sacrés_, which in an instant gleamed in my eyes, and roared and sang\r\nabout my ears were deafening. How they all contrived to miss me I can't\r\nimagine, but miss me they did; and I had passed them about sixty paces,\r\nwhen who should start up over a hedge, a few yards in advance, but my\r\ndomino-player, Sous-lieutenant Victor! In an instant his musket was\r\nraised within two or three feet of my face. Flash! bang! I felt a blow\r\nas if from a thrust of red-hot steel; and for a moment made sure that my\r\nhead was off. With difficulty I kept my seat. The horse dashed on, and I\r\nwas speedily beyond the chance of capture or pursuit. I drew bridle at\r\nthe first village I reached, and found that Victor's bullet had gone\r\nclean through both cheeks. The marks, you see, are still plain enough.\"\r\n\r\nThis was quite true. On slightly separating the gray hairs of the\r\ncaptain's whiskers, the places where the ball had made its entrance and\r\nexit were distinctly visible.\r\n\r\n\"A narrow escape,\" I remarked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, rather; but a miss is as good as a mile. The effusion of blood\r\nnearly choked me; and it was astonishing how much wine and spirits it\r\nrequired to wash the taste out of my mouth. I found,\" continued Mr.\r\nSmith, \"on arriving at head-quarters, that Ciudad Rodrigo had fallen as\r\nreported, and that Lord Wellington was hurrying on to storm Badajoz\r\nbefore the echo of his guns should have reached Massena or Soult in the\r\nfool's paradise where they were both slumbering. I was of course for\r\nsome time on the sick-list, and consequently only assisted at the\r\nassault of Badajoz as a distant spectator--a part I always preferred\r\nwhen I had a choice. It was an awful, terrible business,\" added Mr.\r\nSmith, with unusual solemnity. \"I am not much of a philosopher that I\r\nknow of, nor, except in service hours, particularly given to religion,\r\nbut I remember, when the roar and tumult of the fierce hurricane broke\r\nupon the calm and silence of the night, and a storm of hell-fire seemed\r\nto burst from and encircle the devoted city, wondering what the stars,\r\nwhich were shining brightly overhead, thought of the strife and dim they\r\nlooked so calmly down upon. It was gallantly done, however,\" the veteran\r\nadded, in a brisker tone, \"and read well in the Gazette; and that\r\nperhaps is the chief thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what,\" I asked, \"has all this to do with the charming Coralie and\r\nyour love-adventure?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every thing to do with it, as you will immediately find. I remained in\r\nBadajoz a considerable time after the departure of the army, and was a\r\nmore frequent visitor than ever at the house of the excellent dame who\r\nhad so opportunely aided my escape. She was a kind-hearted soul with all\r\nher vindictiveness; and now that the French were no longer riding\r\nrough-shod over the city, spoke of those who were lurking about in\r\nconcealment--of whom there were believed to be not a few, with sorrow\r\nand compassion. At length the wound I had received at Lieutenant\r\nVictor's hands was thoroughly healed, and I was thinking of departure,\r\nwhen the Andalusian dame introduced me in her taciturn, expressive way\r\nto a charming young Frenchwoman, whose husband, a Spaniard, had been\r\nslain during the assault or sack of the city. The intimacy thus begun\r\nsoon kindled on my part, into an intense admiration. Coralie was gentle,\r\nartless, confiding as she was beautiful, and moreover--as Jeannette, her\r\nsprightly, black-eyed maid informed me in confidence--extremely rich.\r\nHere, gentlemen, was a combination of charms to which only a heart of\r\nstone could remain insensible, and mine at the time was not only young,\r\nbut particularly sensitive and tender, owing in some degree, I daresay,\r\nto the low diet to which I had been so long confined; for nothing, in my\r\nopinion, takes the sense and pluck out of a man so quickly as that. At\r\nall events I soon surrendered at discretion, and was coyly accepted by\r\nthe blushing lady. 'There was only one obstacle,' she timidly observed,\r\n'to our happiness. The relatives of her late husband, by law her\r\nguardians, were prejudiced, mercenary wretches, anxious to marry her to\r\nan old hunks of a Spaniard, so that the property of her late husband,\r\nchiefly consisting of precious stones--he had been a lapidary--might not\r\npass into the hands of foreigners.' I can scarcely believe it now,\"\r\nadded Mr. Smith, with great heat; \"but if I didn't swallow all this\r\nstuff like sack and sugar, I'm a Dutchman! The thought of it, old as I\r\nam, sets my very blood on fire.\r\n\r\n\"At length,\" continued Mr. Marmaduke Smith, as soon as he had partially\r\nrecovered his equanimity--\"at length it was agreed, after all sorts of\r\nschemes had been canvassed and rejected, that the fair widow should be\r\nsmuggled out of Badajoz as luggage in a large chest, which Jeannette and\r\nthe Andalusian landlady--I forget that woman's name--undertook to have\r\nproperly prepared. The marriage ceremony was to be performed by a priest\r\nat a village about twelve English miles off, with whom Coralie undertook\r\nto communicate. 'I trust,' said that lady, 'to the honor of a British\r\nofficer'--I had not then received my commission, but no matter--'that\r\nhe, that you, Captain Smith, will respect the sanctity of my concealment\r\ntill we arrive in the presence of the reverend gentleman who,' she\r\nadded, with a smile like a sunset, 'will, I trust, unite our destinies\r\nforever.' She placed, as she spoke, her charming little hand in mine,\r\nand I, you will hardly credit it, tumbled down on my knees, and vowed to\r\nreligiously respect the dear angel's slightest wish! Mr. Tape, for\r\nmercy's sake, pass the wine, or the bare recollection will choke me!\"\r\n\r\nI must now, for the reasons previously stated, Continue the narrative in\r\nmy own words Every thing was speedily arranged for flight. Mr. Smith\r\nfound no difficulty in procuring from the Spanish commandant an order\r\nwhich would enable him to pass his luggage through the barrier\r\nunsearched; Jeannette was punctual at the rendezvous, and pointed\r\nexultingly to a large chest, which she whispered contained the trembling\r\nCoralie. The chinks were sufficiently wide to admit of the requisite\r\nquantity of air; it locked inside, and when a kind of sail-cloth was\r\nthrown loosely over it, there was nothing very unusual in its\r\nappearance. Tenderly, tremulously did the rejoicing lover assist the\r\nprecious load into the hired bullock-cart, and off they started, Mr.\r\nSmith and Jeannette walking by the side of the richly-freighted vehicle.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith trod on air, but the cart, which had to be dragged over some\r\nof the worst roads in the world, mocked his impatience by its\r\nmarvelously slow progress, and when they halted at noon to give the oxen\r\nwater, they were still three good miles from their destination.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think?\" said Mr. Smith, in a whisper to Jeannette, holding up a\r\nfull pint flask, which he had just drawn from his pocket, and pointing\r\ntoward the chest, \"do you think?--Brandy and water--eh?\"\r\n\r\nJeannette nodded, and the gallant Smith gently approached, tapped at the\r\nlid, and in a soft low whisper proffered the cordial. The lid was, with\r\nthe slightest possible delay, just sufficiently raised to admit the\r\nflask, and instantly reclosed and locked. In about ten minutes the flask\r\nwas returned as silently as it had been received. The enamored soldier\r\nraised it to his lips, made a profound inclination toward his concealed\r\nfiancée, and said, gently, \"A votre santé, charmante Coralie!\" The\r\nbenignant and joyous expression of Mr. Smith's face, as he vainly\r\nelevated the angle of the flask in expectation of the anticipated\r\ndraught, assumed an exceedingly puzzled and bewildered expression. He\r\npeered into the opaque tin vessel; pushed his little finger into its\r\nneck to remove the loose cork or other substance that impeded the genial\r\nflow; then shook it, and listened curiously for a splash or gurgle. Not\r\na sound! Coralie had drained it to the last drop! Mr. Smith looked with\r\ncomical earnestness at Jeannette, who burst into a fit of uncontrollable\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"Madame is thirsty,\" she said, as soon as she could catch sufficient\r\nbreath: \"it must be so hot in there.\"\r\n\r\n\"A full pint!\" said the captain, still in blank astonishment, \"and\r\nstrong--very!\"\r\n\r\nThe approach of the carter interrupted what he further might have had to\r\nsay, and in a few minutes the journey was resumed. The captain fell into\r\na reverie which was not broken till the cart again stopped. The chest\r\nwas then glided gently to the ground: the driver, who had been\r\npreviously paid, turned the heads of his team toward Badajoz, and with a\r\nbrief salutation departed homeward.\r\n\r\nJeanette was stooping over the chest, conversing in a low tone with her\r\nmistress, and Captain Smith surveyed the position in which he found\r\nhimself with some astonishment. No house, much less a church or village\r\nwas visible, and not a human being was to be seen.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Smith,\" said Jeannette, approaching the puzzled warrior with\r\nsome hesitation, \"a slight contretemps has occurred. The friends who\r\nwere to have met us here, and helped to convey our precious charge to a\r\nplace of safety, are not, as you perceive, arrived: perhaps they do not\r\nthink it prudent to venture quite so far.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is quite apparent they are not here,\" observed Mr. Smith; \"but why\r\nnot have proceeded in the cart?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, captain! Betray your and madame's secret to yonder Spanish boor.\r\nHow you talk!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but my good girl, what _is_ to be done? Will madame get out and\r\nwalk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible--impossible!\" ejaculated the amiable damsel. \"We should be\r\nboth recognized, dragged back to that hateful Badajoz, and madame would\r\nbe shut up in a convent for life. It is but about a quarter of a mile,\"\r\nadded Jeannette, in an insinuating, caressing tone, \"and madame is not\r\nso _very_ heavy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" exclaimed Mr. Smith, taken completely aback by this\r\nextraordinary proposal. \"You can't mean that I should take that\r\ninfer--that chest upon my shoulders!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mon Dieu! what else _can_ be done?\" replied Jeannette, with pathetic\r\nearnestness: \"unless you are determined to sacrifice my dear\r\nmistress--she whom you pretended to so love--you hard-hearted, faithless\r\nman!\"\r\n\r\nPartially moved by the damsel's tearful vehemence, Mr. Smith reluctantly\r\napproached, and gently lifted one end of the chest, as an experiment.\r\n\r\n\"There are a great many valuables there besides madame,\" said Jeannette,\r\nin reply to the captain's look, \"and silver coin is, you know, very\r\nheavy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" exclaimed the perplexed lover. \"It is deucedly\r\nunfortunate--still--Don't you think,\" he added earnestly, after again\r\nessaying the weight of the precious burden, \"that if madame were to wrap\r\nherself well up in this sail-cloth, we might reach your friend the\r\npriest's house without detection?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no--no--no!\" rejoined the girl. \"Mon Dieu! how can you think of\r\nexposing madame to such hazard?\"\r\n\r\n\"How far do you say it is?\" asked Captain Smith, after a rather sullen\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\"Only just over the fields yonder--half-a-mile perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Smith still hesitated, but finally the tears and entreaties of the\r\nattendant, his regard for the lady and her fortune, the necessity of the\r\nposition, in short, determined him to undertake the task. A belt was\r\npassed tightly round the chest, by means of which he could keep it on\r\nhis back; and after several unsuccessful efforts, the charming load was\r\nfairly hoisted, and on the captain manfully staggered, Jeannette\r\nbringing up the rear.\r\n\r\nValiantly did Mr. Smith, though perspiring in every pore of his body,\r\nand dry as a cartouch-box--for madame had emptied the only flask he\r\nhad--toil on under a burden which seemed to grind his shoulder-blades to\r\npowder. He declares he must have lost a stone of flesh at least before,\r\nafter numerous restings, he arrived, at the end of about an hour, at the\r\ndoor of a small house, which Jeannette announced to be the private\r\nresidence of the priest. The door was quickly opened by a smart lad, who\r\nseemed to have been expecting them; the chest was deposited on the\r\nfloor, and Jeannette instantly vanished. The lad, with considerate\r\nintelligence, handed Mr. Smith a draught of wine. It was scarcely\r\nswallowed when the key turned in the lock, the eager lover, greatly\r\nrevived by the wine, sprang forward with extended arms, and received in\r\nhis enthusiastic embrace--whom do you think?\r\n\r\n\"Coralie, half-stifled for want of air, and nearly dead with fright,\"\r\nsuggested Mr. Tape.\r\n\r\n\"That rascally Sous-lieutenant Victor! half-drunk with\r\nbrandy-and-water,\" roared Captain Smith, who had by this time worked\r\nhimself into a state of great excitement. \"At the same moment in ran\r\nJeannette, and, I could hardly believe my eyes, that Jezebel Coralie,\r\nfollowed by half-a-dozen French voltigeurs, screaming with laughter! I\r\nsaw I was done,\" continued Mr. Smith, \"but not for the moment precisely\r\nhow, and but for his comrades, I should have settled old and new scores\r\nwith Master Victor very quickly. As it was, they had some difficulty in\r\ngetting him out of my clutches, for I was, as you may suppose, awfully\r\nsavage. An hour or so afterward, when philosophy, a pipe, and some very\r\ncapital wine--they were not bad fellows those voltigeurs--had exercised\r\ntheir soothing influence, I was informed of the exact motives and\r\nparticulars of the trick which had been played me. Coralie was Victor\r\nDufour's wife. He had been wounded at the assault of Badajoz, and\r\nsuccessfully concealed in that Andalusian woman's house; and as the\r\nbest, perhaps only mode of saving him from a Spanish prison, or worse,\r\nthe scheme of which I had been the victim, was concocted. Had not Dufour\r\nwounded me, they would, I was assured, have thrown themselves upon my\r\nhonor and generosity--which honor and generosity, by-the-by, would never\r\nhave got Coralie's husband upon my back, I'll be sworn!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will forgive us, mon cher capitaine?\" said that lady, with one of\r\nher sweetest smiles, as she handed me a cup of wine. \"In love and war,\r\nyou know, every thing is fair.\"\r\n\r\n\"A soldier, gentlemen, is not made of adamant. I was, I confess,\r\nsoftened; and by the time the party broke up, we were all the best\r\nfriends in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so that fat, jolly looking Madame Dufour we saw in Paris, is the\r\nbeautiful Coralie that bewitched Captain Smith?\" said Mr. Tape\r\nthoughtfully--\"Well!\"\r\n\r\n\"She was younger forty years ago, Mr. Tape, than when you saw her.\r\nBeautiful Coralies are rare, I fancy, at her present age, and very\r\nfortunately, too, in my opinion,\" continued Captain Smith; \"for what, I\r\nshould like to know, would become of the peace and comfort of society,\r\nif a woman of sixty could bewitch a man as easily as she does at\r\nsixteen?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHAMPION.\r\n\r\nA ROMANTIC INCIDENT IN EARLY SPANISH HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clang of arms and the inspiriting sounds of martial music resounded\r\nthrough the court-yard of the palace of Navarre. The chivalry of\r\nArragon, Castile, and Navarre had assembled at the summons of their\r\nsovereign, to fight under his banner against the infidels, and now\r\nwaited impatiently for the moment when the monarch should mount his\r\ngallant steed, and lead them to battle and to victory.\r\n\r\nSancho the Fourth was at that moment bidding farewell to his queen, the\r\ngentle Dona Nuna, who clung to her lord in an agony of tears.\r\n\r\n\"Be comforted, my beloved,\" he said to her; \"I shall return to you with\r\nadded laurels to my kingly wreath. Do not fear for me, nor let your\r\nsweet face grow pale by brooding over the dangers and chances of war.\r\nFor my part, I never felt more exulting anticipations of success, and am\r\npersuaded that triumph and victory will crown our undertaking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! it is not so with me,\" said Nuna, sadly. \"A presentiment of\r\napproaching evil weighs heavily on my heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shudder at the thought if our separation, Nuna, more like a timid\r\nyoung bride parting from her newly-wedded lord, than a matron who has\r\nshared her husband's joys and sorrows for well-nigh twenty years.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are now far dearer to me, Sancho, than when I gave you my hand:\r\nhave I not to thank you for the love and tenderness which has made these\r\nlong years of wedded life so blissful and happy?\"\r\n\r\n\"In sooth, I believe, Nuna, it is even so: and you love me as warmly as\r\never. Receive my assurances in return, dear wife, that your face is as\r\nfair to me, and the gift of your true heart as fondly prized, as when I\r\nfirst led you to these halls, my youthful and beautiful bride. But\r\nsuffer me to bid you farewell, or my nobles will wax impatient. I leave\r\nyou to the society of our son, and the guardianship of my trusty Pedro\r\nSésé, who will attend to your behests. One word more. I intrust to your\r\nsafe keeping my beautiful steed, Ilderim. You know how I value the noble\r\nanimal, my first capture from the Moor. See that he is carefully tended\r\nin my absence, I shall accept it as a proof of your regard for my\r\nwishes. And now, adieu, dearest wife. Think of me, and supplicate Heaven\r\nthat I may be speedily and safely restored to your arms.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Sancho the Great, tenderly embraced his wife; and mounting\r\nhis war charger, placed himself at the head of his gallant army. The\r\nclatter of horses' hoofs soon died away in the distance, leaving the\r\ncourt-yard of the castle in silence and gloom.\r\n\r\nThree days after the king's departure, the young Don Garcia entered the\r\ncourt-yard of the palace at Navarre.\r\n\r\n\"Pedro Sésé, Pedro Sésé!\" he cried; \"my noble Arab El Toro lies dead in\r\na cleft of the rocks: I have returned to seek another steed for the\r\nchase: such a boar hunt has not been among the forests of Navarre since\r\nthe Pyrenees echoed to the horn of Roland: give me forth black Ilderim,\r\nPedro, my friend; saddle me my father's charger, for there is no other\r\nsteed in the king's stables worthy of the hunt of to-day!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don Garcia,\" replied the master of the horse, \"black Ilderim is only\r\nfor the king's mounting: I dare not saddle him for any other.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the Infante commands it--the king that is to be.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chafe not with a faithful servant, Don Garcia: it is but yesterday I\r\nrefused the same request of the bastard of Arragon.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! darest thou compare me with the base-born Ramiro? Insolent! I\r\nshall bear my complaint to the queen.\"\r\n\r\nTo the queen Don Garcia bore his complaint and his petition: \"Oh, my\r\nmother, wouldst thou see me dishonored by a menial? Am I not thine only\r\nson, the rightful heir of Arragon, Castile, and Navarre? who may command\r\nhere, if I may not? Assert my authority, then, and order the false Pedro\r\nSésé that he give me forth black Ilderim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pedro Sésé has faithfully discharged his duty to my lord the king, who\r\nenjoined on him and on me the safe keeping of his favorite horse,\" said\r\nDona Nuna. \"The royal stables are open; take, my son, any other steed,\r\nbut leave black Ilderim till thy father's return.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, by Heaven and by the saints, I will have Ilderim to ride this day,\r\nor I will have vengeance!\"\r\n\r\nThe headstrong youth returned to the court-yard, and again demanded the\r\nsteed: again the master of the horse refused. Don Garcia, pale with\r\nconcentrated rage, sprang on another of the king's chargers, and\r\ngalloped from the palace. Instead, however, of returning to the hunt, he\r\nurged his horse into the _despoblado_, or open plain, lying to the south\r\nof the castle, and disappeared on the road to Burgos.\r\n\r\nTime passed heavily, in her lord's absence, with the gentle Nuna. At\r\nfirst, she received frequent and joyful tidings of the successes which\r\ncrowned his arms, and the brilliant victories gained by his forces over\r\nthe Moslem army. Of late, and since the departure of Garcia from the\r\ncastle, Sancho's affectionate dispatches had altogether ceased; and\r\nNuna, now thoroughly wretched, from the wayward perversity of her son,\r\nand from uncertainty as to her husband's fate, had prepared to rejoin\r\nhim at any risk, and share the perils to which he might be exposed.\r\n\r\nHer resolution was no sooner formed than it was promptly carried into\r\neffect: she summoned to her aid the trusty Pedro Sésé; and, protected by\r\na small escort under his command, bade adieu to Navarre, and commenced\r\nher long and perilous journey toward the theatre of war.\r\n\r\nThe little cavalcade had reached Najarra, when, to their surprise and\r\njoy, they beheld a gallant band of horsemen rapidly approaching: the\r\nunited banner of Arragon, Castile, and Navarre, floating proudly before\r\nthem, announced to all beholders that Sancho the Fourth led his knights\r\nin person.\r\n\r\nNuna's heart beat fast and tumultuously; in a few moments, and the long\r\nabsent one would clasp her closely to his breast. She looked up to the\r\nmaster of the horse who rode by her side, and urged him to increased\r\nspeed. They moved briskly forward; and the advancing knights who formed\r\nthe king's body-guard became more distinctly visible. Sancho, as we have\r\nsaid, headed them; but as soon as they had arrived within a short\r\ndistance of the queen's followers, the monarch advanced a few paces, and\r\nin tones of thunder called on them to halt. His brow was darkened with\r\nevil passions, his countenance flushed with anger.\r\n\r\n\"On the peril of your allegiance!\" he shouted, rather than spoke, \"seize\r\nthe traitress, I command ye! My heart refused to hearken to the tale of\r\nher guilt, even when spoken by the lips of her son; but mine eyes have\r\nseen it. I have lived--wretched that I am--to witness her infamy. But\r\nthe adulteress, and the companion of her crime, shall not escape my\r\nrighteous vengeance. See to it, that the queen and Pedro Sésé remain\r\nyour prisoners.\"\r\n\r\nIf a thunderbolt had fallen at the feet of the miserable Nuna, she could\r\nnot have been more horror-struck, or more confounded. Her life-long\r\ndream of happiness was dissipated; the husband of her youth had recoiled\r\nfrom her as from the veriest reptile that crawls on the face of God's\r\nearth; and the worker of her woe and ruin was her own child--her own\r\nflesh and blood--her son Garcia! Who would believe her to be pure and\r\ninnocent when such lips pronounced the tale of her guilt? Unhappy wife;\r\nstill more unhappy mother! In the deepest dungeon of the castle of\r\nNajarra she was left to mourn over her unparalleled misery. Alone,\r\nunfriended, and solitary, Nuna--who so lately had seen herself a beloved\r\nand cherished wife, a fond mother, and a mighty sovereign--struggled\r\nwith her bitter and mournful reflections. She could not reproach her\r\nhusband, for she felt that his ear had been poisoned against her by an\r\naccuser he could scarcely mistrust, even by the insinuations of her son,\r\nconfirmed--as he deemed them to be--by the evidence of his senses, when\r\nhe met her so unexpectedly traveling under the escort of Pedro Sésé.\r\n\r\nBut short space was left to Nuna for these agonizing thoughts. Death, a\r\nshameful death, was the punishment of the adulteress; but Sancho, more\r\nmerciful than she had dared to hope, had granted her one loop-hole for\r\nescape--one slender chance of proving her innocence. The lists were to\r\nbe open to any champion believing in the lady's guiltlessness, who\r\nshould adventure his life in her defense. If any such should proffer his\r\nservices, he might do battle in single combat with her accuser.\r\nGod--according to the belief of those days--would give victory to him\r\nwho maintained the truth!\r\n\r\nThe fatal day approached, arrived, and had well-nigh passed. Garcia,\r\nunopposed, bestrode his war-steed, the redoubtable black Ilderim, whose\r\npossession he had so eagerly coveted, and purchased at so fearful a\r\nprice. The discrowned queen, in conformity with custom, was placed\r\nwithin sight of the arena, tied to a stake, surmounting what would prove\r\nher funeral pile if no champion appeared on her behalf, or if her\r\ndefender should suffer defeat.\r\n\r\nWho can paint the agitation of Dona Nuna, thus placed within view of the\r\nlists, when the precious hours passed, one by one, and no champion stood\r\nforth in defense of her purity and truth? She was about to resign\r\nherself hopelessly to her inexorable fate, when the sound of a horse's\r\ntramp was heard, approaching at a rapid pace; and a knight, in complete\r\narmor, mounted on a charger, whose foaming mouth and reeking sides told\r\nthat he had been ridden at a fearful pace, dashed into the lists, flung\r\ndown his gauntlet of defiance, and announced that he was come to do\r\nbattle in behalf of the falsely-accused, but stainless and guiltless\r\nqueen.\r\n\r\nThere was an involuntary movement among the assembled multitude when\r\nGarcia prepared for the inevitable encounter. None knew, or could guess,\r\nwho the knight might be. No device nor emblem, by which his identity\r\nwould be discovered, could be traced on his helmet or on his shield! but\r\nthe ease with which he surmounted his steed, and his graceful and\r\ngallant bearing, evinced that he was an accomplished warrior.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds, the preliminary arrangements were complete; and, with\r\nlances in rest, the opponents approached. In the first encounter, to the\r\namazement of all, Garcia was unhorsed, and fell heavily to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"She is innocent! She is innocent!\" shouted the multitude.\r\n\r\n\"God be praised! though I have lost a son,\" was the subdued ejaculation\r\nof the king.\r\n\r\n\"I am prepared, in defense of the much-injured lady, to do combat to the\r\ndeath,\" said the stranger knight. \"Base and dastardly villain! confess\r\nthy unnatural crime, or prepare to meet me once more, when I swear I\r\nwill not let thee escape so lightly.\"\r\n\r\nGarcia hesitated; he was evidently torn by conflicting emotions.\r\nConscious guilt--fear of the just retribution of Heaven, executed by the\r\nstranger's avenging sword--urged him to confess his villainy. On the\r\nother hand, apprehension of the execrations of the multitude, and the\r\nindignation of his injured parents, restrained him from making a frank\r\navowal of his crime.\r\n\r\n\"Remount, miscreant! and make ready for another encounter, or confess\r\nthat you have lied in your throat,\" exclaimed the stranger, sternly.\r\n\r\nBefore Garcia could reply, an aged and venerable ecclesiastic threw\r\nhimself between the opponents.\r\n\r\n\"In the name of Heaven! I command ye to withhold from this unnatural\r\nstrife,\" he exclaimed, addressing them; \"brothers are ye; the blood of a\r\ncommon father flows in your veins. Ramiro--forbear. Garcia--the combat\r\nthis day has testified to your guilt; make the only atonement in your\r\npower, by a full confession.\"\r\n\r\nEjaculations of astonishment and pity burst from all the spectators.\r\n\"Long live the noble bastard! The base-born has made base the well-born!\r\nThe step-son has proved the true son! Praise be to the Virgin, the\r\nmother of the people has not been left without a godson to fight for\r\nher!\" And all the matrons, and many even of the hardened warriors among\r\nthe multitude, wept with tenderness and joy.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the agitated queen found herself in her husband's arms.\r\nHe implored her forgiveness for the sorrow she had endured; nor could\r\nshe withhold it, even for a moment, when she listened to the avowals of\r\nthe degraded Garcia, who confessed how, step by step, he had poisoned\r\nhis father's mind by tales of her infidelity, in revenge for her\r\nrefusal, and that of Pedro Sésé, to intrust him with Sancho's favorite\r\ncharger, black Ilderim.\r\n\r\nNuna turned from her abject son, and motioned her young champion to\r\napproach. He knelt at her feet.\r\n\r\n\"Ramiro,\" she softly said, as she unclasped the helmet and visor which\r\nconcealed the handsome features of Sancho's illegitimate son, \"child of\r\nmy affections, for whom I have ever felt a mother's love, though I have\r\nnot borne for thee a mother's pains; how shall I thank thee? Thou hast\r\nthis day more than repaid the tenderness I lavished on thy infant years.\r\nThou hast made clear my fair fame to all men; even at the risk of thy\r\nown young life.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would lay down life itself for such a friend as you have been, and\r\nesteem the sacrifice light,\" rejoined Ramiro, with deep emotion. \"I\r\nremember my childish days--before you came to Navarre, a bright, happy,\r\ninnocent bride--when I wandered through my father's palace an unloved\r\nand neglected boy; and I can recall vividly the moment when you first\r\nencountered me, and, struck by the resemblance I bore to the king,\r\nsurmised the truth. Instead of hating me with the unjust aversion of an\r\nungenerous nature, you took the despised child to your heart, and, for\r\nthe love you bore your lord, you loved and cherished his base-born son.\r\nFor the genial atmosphere you created around me, and in which my\r\naffections expanded, and for the care you have bestowed on my\r\neducation, I owe you a debt of gratitude far deeper than ever child bore\r\nhis own mother. Nature dictates maternal love, in the one instance--but\r\nit is to the suggestions of a noble and generous heart that I have been\r\nindebted for the happiness of my life. You owe me no thanks--for, for\r\nsuch a friend no sacrifice can be too great.\"\r\n\r\nNuna turned to the king; and, taking his hand in hers, placed it on the\r\nhead of her young champion. \"I have brought you kingdoms as my dower,\"\r\nshe said, \"but I have not, alas! brought you a son so worthy as Ramiro\r\nof being their ruler. I freely forgive the Infante the suffering he has\r\ncaused me, and hope that, with advancing years, he will cultivate the\r\nvirtues in which he has shown himself to be deficient. But Ramiro has\r\nalready given evidence of the possession of those exalted qualities\r\nwhich insure the happiness of a people when possessed by their rulers.\r\nInvest him then, at my entreaty, with the crown of Arragon; receive back\r\nto your confidence our faithful Pedro Sésé; and suffer me to forget my\r\npast griefs in the anticipation of a love which shall never again be\r\ninterrupted.\"\r\n\r\nThe king raised his hand in assent; and the assembled multitude\r\nconfirmed the investiture with one mighty shout--\"Ramiro! Ramiro! long\r\nlive Ramiro! Infante of Arragon!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FARM-LABORER.--THE SON.\r\n\r\nBY HARRIET MARTINEAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been told that Susan Banks found herself well placed, after the\r\ndeath of her insane aunt obliged her to look for a home and a\r\nmaintenance. As I am not telling her story, I will pass over the account\r\nof the efforts she made to be a schoolmistress, and the instruction she\r\nhad as a dressmaker. She was in poor health (reduced by hunger) and in\r\ndebt £3 to her uncle, and nervous and anxious, when she heard that a\r\nlady from the North, then visiting in the neighborhood, wanted just such\r\na maid as Susan thought she could become with a little teaching. She\r\nobtained the place, took pains to learn to wait at table, &c., and\r\nwithin a year had paid her debt to her uncle, and spared £2 besides to\r\nher family; and all this, though her box had had but few clothes in it\r\nwhen she went to her new home.\r\n\r\nAt the end of a year, her employer, Miss Foote, began to think of\r\ncultivating the small portion of land about the house which had hitherto\r\nbeen let off for grazing, and which was deteriorating in quality from\r\nthe mismanagement of the tenant. Not approving of the methods of tillage\r\nin the neighborhood, and knowing that there were no spare hands there,\r\nMiss Foote wrote to a parish officer in Susan's and her own native\r\ncounty, to ask if a laborer of good character and sound qualifications\r\ncould be sent to her by the parish, on her engaging to pay him twelve\r\nshillings a week for a year and a half, while her experiment of\r\ncultivation was under trial; and longer, if it should be found to\r\nanswer. This was all she could undertake, as she could not afford to\r\ncarry on the scheme at a loss. The answer was some time in coming. When\r\nit came, it told that pauper laborers could not be recommended; but a\r\nbetter sort of laborer might be sent, and his place in the parish would\r\nbe filled, only too easily, by some of the young men from the workhouse.\r\nThe proposal was to send the very best man of his class known to the\r\nparish officers. He and his wife had money enough in the savings' bank\r\nto pay their journey, and they were willing to make the venture. The\r\nman's name was Harry Banks. Miss Foote took the letter into the kitchen,\r\nand read it to Susan and her fellow-servant. When Susan heard the name,\r\nshe started as if she had been shot, and screamed out, \"Why, that's my\r\nbrother!\" Thus far, far away from home, she was to have a brother and\r\nhis wife beside her, living in the pretty little cottage which was\r\nbuilding behind the oak copse for the new laborer. Miss Foote inquired\r\nabout the wife, but could learn little. Susan told nothing but that she\r\nwas a respectable woman, but so old, and otherwise unsuitable, that it\r\nwas a vexation to the family that Harry had made such a marriage. Harry\r\nnever seemed to see a single fault in her; but his father and mother did\r\nnot like Dinah at all.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Foote afterward came to know the whole, she thought this\r\nmarriage the most terribly significant part of the whole family history\r\nof the Bankses. At thirty years of age Harry was a pattern of a\r\nfarm-laborer; yet he had no prospect in life but of earning a precarious\r\nnine shillings a week, till he should be too old to earn so much. He\r\nworked for a rich, close-fisted Dissenting gentleman, who had always\r\npious sayings on his lips and at the point of his pen, but never took\r\noff his eye for an instant from his money gains and savings. His wife\r\nwas like him, and their servants grew like them--even the warm-hearted,\r\nimpetuous Harry, and much more Dinah, their worn out maid-of-all-work.\r\nDinah always said that the register of her birth was unfortunately lost,\r\nand she could not tell precisely how old she was; and she called herself\r\n\"upwards o' forty.\" Most people supposed her about sixty when she\r\nmarried. She used to tell Harry that she was the prettiest girl in the\r\ncity when she was young, and Harry did not ask how long ago that was,\r\nnor look too much at the little wizened face, not more marked by\r\nsmall-pox than by signs of over-exhausting toil. Whatever might be her\r\nage, she was worn out by excessive work. When Harry's father heard that\r\nshe and Harry were going before the registrar to be married, he kindly\r\nand seriously asked Harry if he had considered what he was about; and\r\nHarry's reply was enough to make any heart ache.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father, I have. I'm not so very much set on it; but I think it\r\nwill be most comfortable. You see, there's no use in people like us\r\nthinking of having children. Children would only starve us downright,\r\nand bring us to the Union. You see, none of us are married, nor likely\r\nto be, except me with Dinah. She's clean and tidy, you see, and she has\r\nsome wages laid by, and so have I; and so nobody need find fault. And I\r\nshall be more comfortable like, with somebody to do for me at home;\r\nand--\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was going on to tell how Dinah would cook his dinner and mend his\r\nclothes, but his father could not bear to hear him, and finished off\r\nwith saying that it was his own affair, and he wished them well.\r\n\r\nIt was within a year after their marriage that Harry was engaged, by\r\nMiss Foote. In great glee he made haste to prepare himself for his\r\nimportant new place in every way he could think of. He learned to trim a\r\nvine, not knowing that the place he was going to was too far north for\r\nvine-growing. He made interest with a butcher to learn how to kill a\r\npig. He made a little collection of superior cabbage and turnip seeds,\r\nseed potatoes, &c., thus proving to Miss Foote at the outset that he had\r\nplenty of energy and quickness. She found, too, that he had courage. His\r\nemployers, vexed to lose two servants whom they had trained to excessive\r\neconomy, as well as hard work, did every thing that was possible, while\r\nthere was any chance of success, to frighten them from moving northward.\r\nThey told Dinah, with mournful countenances, that they should certainly\r\ndie--that it was all the same as being transported--that it was cruelty\r\nin the parish officers to let them be tempted. Dinah repeated all this\r\nto Harry; and it staggered him at first; but he presently remembered\r\nthat Susan wrote that her health had improved; and her letters had not\r\nonly contained post-office orders, but plain signs that she was very\r\nhappy. Harry determined to proceed; and when he had once made up his\r\nmind, his employers showed themselves very kind--helping their\r\npreparations, and having them to dinner on the last day.\r\n\r\nBy their own account their journey must have been a curious affair.\r\nTheir heads were so full of notions of thieves and sharpers, that they\r\ndid every thing in the slyest way, and wrapped themselves in mystery,\r\nand pretended to despise their boxes, while in one continued agony about\r\nthem. When met by a kind gentleman who was to see them through London,\r\nDinah pretended not to be the right person, lest the gentleman should\r\nnot be the right; so that it was lucky they did lose his help\r\naltogether. Miss Foote was disagreeably impressed by their account of\r\ntheir great slyness, and not less by the suspicious temper--natural,\r\nperhaps, to Dinah, but not at all so to Harry--in which they began their\r\nnew mode of life. Dinah was no servant of hers; so she had nothing to do\r\nwith Dinah's ways, but to check the jealousy and suspicion she showed of\r\nher young sister-in-law and the young cook. On occasion of leaving home\r\nfor some weeks, the lady took the opportunity of intimating to the\r\npeople at the cottage that there was a perfect understanding between\r\nthe girls and herself, as perfect a confidence as there can be between\r\nmother and daughters; that their acquaintances came by her permission,\r\nand so forth. Harry promised to be attentive and sociable with his\r\nsister, and not to grow hot with the cook about how to feed the fowls\r\nand manage the churn. That was the time when Dinah left off peeping\r\nthrough the laurels to see who went to the back door, and looking\r\nmysterious and sympathetic when holding forth to Miss Foote about young\r\npeople. Still it was long before she left off locking her door and\r\nhiding the key, if she turned her back for a minute, and taking every\r\nbody she did not know for a thief. She was left to her own notions; but\r\nwith Harry a serious remonstrance was necessary, more than once, within\r\nthe first year of his new service. Miss Foote was as much annoyed as\r\namused with his higgling ways, all in zeal for her interests. She feared\r\nthat she should have the reputation in the neighborhood of being a\r\nperfect miser, so wonderful were Harry's stories of the bargains he\r\nattempted to drive. She told him she hoped he would never succeed in any\r\none such bargain as the many he told her of; and she laid her positive\r\ncommands upon him never, in her name, to beat down the seller of any\r\narticle she sent him to buy. As she supposed, she found he had caught up\r\nthe trick from example, and had not the knowledge whereby to remedy it.\r\nWhen she told him it was not the way of the place to cheat in making\r\ncharges he shook his head, and very nearly put his tongue in his cheek;\r\nbut when she explained to him how prices came to be, and how an article\r\ncan not properly be bought for less than it took to make or grow it, he\r\nwas convinced at once, and his higgling method was softened down into a\r\nmere excessive strictness and vigilance in buying and selling\r\ntransactions. There never was any real meanness about the man. In a few\r\nmonths he sent his father ten shillings; in a few months more he sent\r\nhim £1. A small anecdote will show better than this, that money is not\r\nnaturally the first object with him. When his employer kills a pig he is\r\nallowed to take a quarter at wholesale price, and Dinah cures the ham so\r\nwell that by selling it they get their bacon for next to nothing. One\r\nautumn, when two pigs were killed, there was such a scramble for them,\r\nand so many neighbors would be \"hurt in their feelings\" if they could\r\nnot have a portion, that Miss Foote found herself left with two gammons,\r\nbut no ham. Harry heard this in the kitchen. He kept silence till his\r\nham was finely cured, and then, touching his hat as if asking a favor,\r\nhe told his employer that she had done good things for him, and he had\r\nnever been able to do any for her, and he should be much pleased if she\r\nwould take the ham for what he gave for it. Though not agreeing to this\r\nexactly, Miss Foote found herself obliged to take the ham very cheap.\r\n\r\nAnother small incident showed the same gentlemanly spirit. At the time\r\nwhen his whole soul was engrossed with the desire to make \"the\r\nexperiment\" answer, he had a request to present, as often during a whole\r\nwinter as he could edge it in. There was a certain long, ugly hedge,\r\npernicious in every way, which divided the field from a neighbor's. The\r\nhedge belonged to the neighbor; and it appeared that he would be\r\nheartily glad to give it away to any body who would take it down and put\r\nup some fence which would cover less ground and harbor less vermin.\r\nHarry was so eager to be allowed to remove the hedge, that Miss Foote at\r\nlast told him that she should never have dreamed of his undertaking such\r\na job in addition to his regular work; but that he might please himself.\r\nShe would put up a new fence if he chose to make way for it. He did it\r\nwith no help but in felling some pollards. One afternoon, when wheeling\r\nup hill an enormous load of wood from the hedge, he heard himself\r\nlaughed at from the next field. Now, no man winces more under a laugh\r\nthan Harry; yet he bore it well this time. Some men called out mockingly\r\nthat he was doing horse's work and man's work at once, and they would\r\nnot do that to please any body. \"No,\" said Harry, turning full round\r\ntoward them, \"nor, I neither. Miss Foote never asked me to do this. I do\r\nit to please myself.\"\r\n\r\nNo man, I have said, winces under a laugh more than Harry; and his only\r\nsuffering worth mentioning, since he came to his new place, has been\r\nfrom this dislike of ridicule. When the cottage was ready, Miss Foote\r\nproposed a house-warming, and invited herself and her two maids there to\r\ntea. It was a particularly pleasant evening, with a fine fire, and\r\nplenty of light, and good tea and cake, and all the five in capital\r\nspirits. Harry was made to take the arm-chair by his own fireside; and\r\nwhen he began to crack his jokes it appeared that he had his own notions\r\nof the ridiculous. He quizzed his nearest neighbor, an old man, who had\r\nmarried a comparatively young woman, and whose children were forever\r\nplaying about Miss Foote's gate. When Harry joked about that unequal\r\nmatch, Miss Foote could not laugh. She thought his own infinitely worse.\r\nAnd the poor fellow soon saw that others were quizzing him, much more\r\nseverely than he had quizzed the old man. He looks grave about Dinah\r\nnow, and has left off talking of his own prudence in making such a\r\nmarriage. He has also told his sister that when Dinah dies he shall not\r\nmarry again. It is very painful; and yet Dinah is improved beyond all\r\nthat could have been anticipated. She has put off her false front, and\r\nlets her grizzled hair appear. She no longer scans Miss Foote's face to\r\nmake out what it would be most acceptable that she should say, but\r\nrattles away about her affairs with a sort of youthful glee. She no\r\nlonger speaks in a whining tone, but lets her voice take its own way.\r\nOne day she leaned on her rake (when she was trimming her own\r\nflower-bed), and told Miss Foote, without any canting whatever, that she\r\nhad quite changed her mind about the maids since she came. She was\r\nlooking too far then, and so did not see what they were; but she found\r\nin time that there was no slyness or pretense, but that they were really\r\ngood faithful girls, working for their employer's good, and with no\r\nplots of their own. Old as Dinah seemed to be, there appears to be a\r\nchance of her growing ingenuous and agreeable before she dies. The\r\ngentry who come to the house observe that they never saw two people so\r\naltered as Harry and Dinah; that they seem to have got new faces, a new\r\ngait--a new mind.\r\n\r\nHarry had other ridicule to wince about. The neighbors laughed at him\r\nand his employer about their whole plan; they had never heard of keeping\r\ncows on less than three acres per cow, or, at least, five acres for two;\r\nthey had never seen such deep digging; they had never known any body\r\ntake the trouble to remove stones, or do any thing but bury them out of\r\nsight; they had never seen a currycomb used to a cow; they had never\r\nknown a hardworking man so poor-spirited as to be a water-drinker. The\r\nmilk must cost Miss Foote 6_d._ a quart; the cow would die; Harry would\r\nwear himself out; and so forth. One day, the first winter, the cow was\r\nvery ill. Between the fear of the experiment being given up, and love\r\nfor the creature, and dread of the neighbors, Harry was wretched. The\r\ntears streamed down his face as he waited on the sick beast. She got\r\nwell, however; and now Harry meets ridicule with a bolder face. A\r\ntemperance society having been set up in the place, he has joined it,\r\nthough far above all temptation to drink. He finds it a convenience,\r\nwhen pressed to drink, to cut the matter short by saying that he is a\r\npledged member--and a curious temperance preacher he is. When told\r\nlately that his cows would rot under his method of treatment, his answer\r\nwas: \"No, it isn't they that will rot. I'll tell you who 'tis that will\r\nrot; 'tis them that put filthy spirits into their stomachs to turn their\r\nbrains, that will rot, and not my cows, that drink sweet water.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a grave side to Harry's lot now, happy as he is. He looks\r\nserious and hurt at times, though his health has much strengthened, his\r\nearnings are sure, his wages are raised, his Sunday dress is like that\r\nof a gentleman, there is meat on his table daily, and he has had the\r\ncomfort of assisting his parents. Notwithstanding all this, a cloud\r\ncomes over his face at times. As his sister says, \"he feels the _injury_\r\nof his want of education.\" His mind is opening very rapidly. At any\r\nspare quarter of an hour he lectures Miss Foote on industry, temperance,\r\nduty to parents, and other good topics. The moral discoveries he has\r\nmade are wonderful to him. He has attended church all his life; but\r\ntruths come with new force into his mind when they enter through the\r\nspirit of hope and the medium of success. He says \"it was wonderful the\r\nideas that come into a man's mind when he sets himself a-thinking over\r\nhis work, and there is no care to take up his thoughts.\" Hence the\r\nbrightened countenance which the neighbors remark on: but hence, too,\r\nthe bitter regret at his wasted years of school life--at \"the _injury_\r\nof his want of education.\" What might he not hope to be and do now,\r\nSusan says, if he had but the knowledge that every man may be said to\r\nhave the right to be possessed of? Yet, the good fellow has raised his\r\nfamily to a point of comfort. A gentleman who heard of his merits, as a\r\nfirst-rate laborer, wrote to the same parish officers, to inquire if\r\nthere were any brothers. There was Tom; and Tom is now in a happy\r\nsituation, highly esteemed by his employer, and earning 14_s._ a week.\r\nThe employer, finding that Tom sadly missed intercourse with his family,\r\nand knowing that he could neither read nor write letters, sent for the\r\nsister, Lizzy, to be under-nursemaid in the family. In another way Harry\r\nhas done a deeper and wider good. Miss Foote's friends tell her that his\r\nexample is beginning to _tell_ in the neighborhood; his example, not\r\nonly of strenuous and skillful labor, but by integrity, temperance, and\r\ndisinterested attachment to his employer.\r\n\r\nAll this is well--very pleasant to contemplate--but a disturbing\r\nquestion arises in the midst of it: What can society say to these\r\nexcellent young men in excuse for their deprivation of family life? And\r\nagain, what is at best their prospect for old age?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(From Bentley's Miscellany.)\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER ON WOLVES.\r\n\r\nBY THE AUTHOR OF \"LORD BACON IN ADVERSITY,\" ETC.\r\n\r\n    We rustled through the leaves like wind,\r\n    Left shrubs and trees and wolves behind;\r\n    By night I beard them on the track,\r\n    Their troop came hard upon our back,\r\n    With their long gallop, which can tire\r\n    The hounds' deep hate and hunter's fire;\r\n    Where'er we flew, they followed on,\r\n    Nor left us with the morning sun.\r\n    Behind I saw them, scarce a rood\r\n    At daybreak winding through the wood,\r\n    And through the night had heard their feet,\r\n    Their stealing, rustling step repeat.\r\n    Oh! how I wished for spear or sword\r\n    At least to die amidst the horde,\r\n    And perish--if it must be so--\r\n    At bay, destroying many a foe!\r\n                          _Mazeppa._\r\n\r\n\r\nA peculiar interest attaches to the wolf, from the close analogy which\r\nin all its essential features it presents to the faithful companion of\r\nman. So close indeed is the analogy, that some of the ablest zoologists,\r\nthe celebrated John Hunter included, have entertained the opinion that\r\ndogs, in all their varieties, and wolves, have descended from a common\r\nstock. With the exception of an obliquity in the position of the eyes,\r\nthere is no appreciable anatomical difference between these animals. The\r\nquestion is one of difficulty; but we believe we are correct in stating\r\nthat the majority of the highest authorities agree in the belief that\r\nthese animals are not derived from a common parent, but were originally\r\ndistinct, and will ever so continue. There are several species of wild\r\ndogs known, quite distinct from the wolf; and although the opportunities\r\nhave been numerous for dogs resuming their pristine form, by long\r\ncontinuance in a savage state, no instance has ever occurred of their\r\nbecoming wolves, however much they might degenerate from the domestic\r\nbreed. The honest and intelligent shepherd-dog was regarded by Buffon as\r\nthe \"_fons et origo_,\" from which all other dogs, great and small, have\r\nsprung; and he drew up a kind of genealogical table, showing how\r\nclimate, food, education, and intermixture of breeds gave rise to the\r\nvarieties. At Katmandoo there are many plants found in a wild state,\r\nwhich man has carried with him in his migrations, and wild animals,\r\nwhich may present the typical forms whence some of our domestic races\r\nhave been derived; among these is a wild dog, which Mr. Hodgson\r\nconsiders to be the primitive species of the whole canine race. By\r\nProfessor Kretchner, the jackal was regarded as the type of the dogs of\r\nancient Egypt, an idea supported by the representations on the walls of\r\nthe temples. This question, however, of the origin of the canine race,\r\nis so thoroughly obscured by the mists of countless ages, as to be\r\nincapable of direct proof. Philosophers may indulge themselves with\r\nspeculations; but in the absence of that keystone, proof, the matter\r\nmust rest on the basis of theory alone.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the chief differences between wolves, wild\r\ndogs, and domestic dogs. The ears of the wild animals are always\r\npricked, the lop or drooping ear being essentially a mark of\r\ncivilization; with very rare exceptions, their tails hang more or less\r\nand are bushy, the honest cock of the tail so characteristic of a\r\nrespectable dog, being wanting. This is certainly the rule; but, curious\r\nenough, the Zoological Gardens contain at the present moment, a\r\nPortuguese female wolf which carries her tail as erect and with as bold\r\nan air as any dog. Wolves and wild dogs growl, howl, yelp, and cry most\r\ndiscordantly, but with one exception, do not bark; that exception being\r\nthe wild hunting-dog of South Africa, which, according to Mr. Cumming,\r\nhas three distinct cries; one is peculiarly soft and melodious, but\r\ndistinguishable at a great distance: this is analogous to the\r\ntrumpet-call, \"halt and rally,\" of cavalry, serving to collect the\r\nscattered pack when broken in hot chase. A second cry, which has been\r\ncompared to the chattering of monkeys, is emitted at night when the dogs\r\nare excited; and the third note is described as a sharp, angry bark,\r\nusually uttered when they behold an object they can not make out, but\r\nwhich differs from the true, well-known bark of the domestic dog.\r\n\r\nThe common or European wolf is found from Egypt to Lapland, and is most\r\nprobably the variety that formerly haunted these islands. The wolves of\r\nRussia are large and fierce, and have a peculiarly savage aspect. The\r\nSwedish and Norwegian are similar to the Russian in form, but are\r\nlighter in color, and in winter, totally white. Those of France are\r\nbrowner and smaller than either of these, and the Alpine wolves are\r\nsmaller still. Wolves are very numerous in the northern regions of\r\nAmerica; \"their foot-marks,\" says Sir John Richardson, \"may be seen by\r\nthe side of every stream, and a traveler can rarely pass the night in\r\nthese wilds without hearing them howling around him.\"[1] These wolves\r\nburrow, and bring forth their young in earths with several outlets, like\r\nthose of a fox. Sir John saw none with the gaunt appearance, the long\r\njaw and tapering nose, long legs and slender feet, of the Pyrenean\r\nwolves.\r\n\r\nIndia, too, is infested with wolves, which are smaller than the\r\nEuropean. There is a remarkably fine animal at the Zoological Gardens,\r\nborn of a European father and Indian mother, which, in size and other\r\nrespects, so closely partakes of the characteristics of his sire, that\r\nhe might well pass for pure blood.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients, wolves gave rise to many superstitious fictions. For\r\ninstance, it was said that they possessed \"an evil eye,\" and that, if\r\nthey looked on a man before he saw them, he would forthwith lose his\r\nvoice. Again, we find the Roman witches, like the weird sisters of\r\nMacbeth, employing the wolf in their incantations:\r\n\r\n    \"Utque lupi barbam variæ cum dente colubræ\r\n    Abdiderint furtim terris.\"\r\n\r\n          HOR. _Sat._ viii. lib. i.\r\n\r\nThere was a myth prevalent among the ancients, that in Arcadia there\r\nlived a certain family of the Antæi, of which one was ever obliged to be\r\ntransformed into a wolf. The members of the family cast lots, and all\r\naccompanied the luckless wight on whom the lot fell, to a pool of water.\r\nThis he swam over, and having entered into the wilderness on the other\r\nside, was forthwith in form, a wolf, and for nine years kept company\r\nwith wolves: at the expiration of that period he again swam across the\r\npool, and was restored to his natural shape, only that the addition of\r\nnine years was placed upon his features. It was also imagined that the\r\ntail of the wolf contained a hair, which acted as a love philtre and\r\nexcited the tender passion. The myth of Romulus and Remus having been\r\nsuckled by a wolf, arose from the simple circumstance of their nurse\r\nhaving been named Lupa--an explanation which sadly does away with the\r\ngarland of romance that so long surrounded the story of the founders of\r\nRome. The figure of the wolf at one time formed a standard for the Roman\r\nlegions, as saith Pliny, \"Caius Marius, in his second consulship,\r\nordained that the legions of Roman soldiers only should have the egle\r\nfor their standard, and no other signe, for before time the egle\r\nmarched foremost indeed, but in a ranke of foure others, to wit,\r\nwolves, minotaures, horses, and bores.\"[2]\r\n\r\nThe dried snout of a wolf held, in the estimation of the ancients, the\r\nsame rank that a horseshoe does now with the credulous. It was nailed\r\nupon the gates of country farms, as a counter-charm against the evil\r\neye, and was supposed to be a powerful antidote to incantations and\r\nwitchcraft. New-married ladies were wont, upon their wedding-day, to\r\nanoint the side-posts of their husbands' houses with wolves' grease, to\r\ndefeat all demoniac arts. These animals bore, however, but a bad\r\ncharacter when alive; for, exclusive of their depredations, it was\r\nimagined that if horses chanced to tread in the foot-tracks of wolves,\r\ntheir feet were immediately benumbed; but Pliny also says, \"Verily, the\r\ngreat master teeth and grinders of a wolf being hanged about an horse\r\nnecke, cause him that he shall never tire and be weary, be he put to\r\nnever so much running in any race whatsoever.\" When a territory was much\r\ninfested with wolves, the following ceremony was performed with much\r\nsolemnity and deep subsequent carousal: A wolf would be caught alive,\r\nand his legs carefully broken. He was then dragged around the confines\r\nof the farm, being bled with a knife from time to time, so that the\r\nblood might sprinkle the ground. Being generally dead when the journey\r\nhad been completed, he was buried in the very spot whence he had started\r\non his painful race.\r\n\r\nThere was scarcely a filthy thing upon the earth, or under the earth,\r\nwhich the ancients did not in some way use medicinally; and we find\r\nPaulus Ægineta recommends the dry and pounded liver of a wolf, steeped\r\nin sweet wine, as a sovereign remedy for diseases of the liver, &c.\r\n\r\nOur English word _wolf_ is derived from the Saxon _wulf_ and from the\r\nsame root, the German _wolf_, the Swedish _ulf_, and Danish _ulv_ are\r\nprobably derived. Wolves were at one time a great scourge to this\r\ncountry, the dense forests which formerly covered the land favoring\r\ntheir safety and their increase. Edgar applied himself seriously to rid\r\nhis subjects of this pest, by commuting the punishment of certain crimes\r\ninto the acceptance of a number of wolves' tongues from each criminal;\r\nand in Wales by commuting a tax of gold and silver imposed on the\r\nPrinces of Cambria by Ethelstan, into an annual tribute of three hundred\r\nwolves' heads, which Jenaf, Prince of North Wales, paid so punctually,\r\nthat by the fourth year the breed was extinct. Not so, however, in\r\nEngland, for like ill weeds, they increased and multiplied here,\r\nrendering necessary the appointment, in the reign of the first Edward,\r\nof a _wolf-hunter_ general, in the person of one Peter Corbet; and his\r\nmajesty thought it not beneath his dignity to issue a mandamus, bearing\r\ndate May 14th, 1281, to all bailiffs, &c., to aid and assist the said\r\nPeter in the destruction of wolves in the counties of Gloucester,\r\nWorcester, Hereford, Shropshire, and Stafford; and Camden informs us\r\nthat in Derby, lands were held at Wormhill by the duty of hunting and\r\ntaking the wolves that infested that county. In the reign of Athelstan,\r\nthese pests had so abounded in Yorkshire, that a retreat was built at\r\nFlixton in that county, \"to defend passengers from the wolves that they\r\nshould not be devoured by them.\" Our Saxon ancestors also called\r\nJanuary, when wolves pair, _wolf-moneth_; and an outlaw was termed\r\n_wolfshed_, being out of the protection of the law, and as liable to be\r\nkilled as that destructive beast.\r\n\r\nA curious notice of the existence of wolves and foxes in Scotland is\r\nafforded in Bellenden's translation of Boetius.[3] \"The wolffis are\r\nright noisome to tame beastial in all parts of Scotland, except one part\r\nthereof, named Glenmorris, in which the tame beastial gets little damage\r\nof wild beastial, especially of tods (foxes); for each house nurses a\r\nyoung tod certain days, and mengis (mixes) the flesh thereof, after it\r\nbe slain, with such meat as they give to their fowls or other small\r\nbeasts, and so many as eat of this meat are preserved two months after\r\nfrom any damage of tods; for tods will eat no flesh that gusts of their\r\nown kind.\" The last wolf killed in Scotland is said to have fallen by\r\nthe hand of Sir Ewen Cameron, about 1680; and singular to say, the skin\r\nof this venerable quadruped may yet be in existence: in a catalogue of\r\nMr. Donnovan's sale of the London Museum, in April, 1818, there occurs\r\nthe following item, \"Lot 832. Wolf, a noble animal in a large glass\r\ncase. The last wolf killed in Scotland, by Sir E. Cameron.\" It would be\r\ninteresting to know what became of this lot.\r\n\r\nThe pairing time is January, when after many battles with rivals, the\r\nstrongest males attach themselves to the females. The female wolf\r\nprepares a warm nest for her young, of soft moss and her own hair,\r\ncarefully blended together. The cubs are watched by the parents with\r\ntender solicitude, are gradually accustomed to flesh, and when\r\nsufficiently strong their education begins, and they are taken to join\r\nin the chase; not the least curious part is the discipline by which they\r\nare inured to suffering and taught to bear pain without complaint; their\r\nparents are said to bite, maltreat, and drag them by the tail, punishing\r\nthem if they utter a cry, until they have learned to be mute. To this\r\nquality Macaulay alludes when speaking of a wolf in his \"Prophecy of\r\nCapys:\"\r\n\r\n    \"When all the pack, loud baying,\r\n      Her bloody lair surrounds,\r\n    She dies in silence, biting hard,\r\n      Amidst the dying hounds.\"\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe the cunning acquired by wolves in well\r\ninhabited districts, where they are eagerly sought for destruction; they\r\nthen never quit cover to windward: they trot along just within the edges\r\nof the wood until they meet the wind from the open country, and are\r\nassured by their keen scent that no danger awaits them in that\r\nquarter--then they advance, keeping under cover of hedgerows as much as\r\npossible, moving in single file and treading in each other's track;\r\nnarrow roads they bound across, without leaving a footprint. When a wolf\r\ncontemplates a visit to a farmyard, he first carefully reconnoitres the\r\nground, listening, snuffing up the air, and smelling the earth; he then\r\nsprings over the threshold without touching it and seizes on his prey.\r\nIn retreat his head is low, turned obliquely, with one ear forward the\r\nother back, and the eyes glaring. He trots crouching, his brush\r\nobliterating the track of his feet till at some distance from the scene\r\nof his depredation, then feeling himself secure, he waves his tail erect\r\nin triumph, and boldly pushes on to cover.\r\n\r\nIn northern India, wolves together with jackals and pariah dogs, prowl\r\nabout the dwellings of Europeans. Colonel Hamilton Smith relates a\r\ncurious accident which befell a servant who was sleeping in a verandah\r\nwith his head near the outer lattice: a wolf thrust his jaws between the\r\nbamboo, seized the man by the head, and endeavored to drag him through;\r\nthe man's shrieks awakened the whole neighborhood, and assistance came,\r\nbut though the wolf was struck at by many, he escaped. Wolves have even\r\nbeen known to attack sentries when single, as in the last campaign of\r\nthe French armies in the vicinity of Vienna, when several of the\r\nvidettes were carried off by them. During the retreat of Napoleon's army\r\nfrom Russia, wolves of the Siberian race followed the troops to the\r\nborders of the Rhine; specimens of these wolves shot in the vicinity,\r\nand easily distinguishable from the native breed, are still preserved in\r\nthe museums of Neuwied, Frankfort, and Cassel.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lyon[4] relates the following singular instance of the cunning\r\nof a wolf which had been caught in a trap, and, being to all appearance\r\ndead, was dragged on board ship: \"The eyes, however, were observed to\r\nwink whenever an object was placed near them, some precautions were,\r\ntherefore, considered necessary, and the legs being tied the animal was\r\nhoisted up with his head downward. He then, to our surprise, made a\r\nvigorous spring at those near him, and afterward repeatedly turned\r\nhimself upward so as to reach the rope by which he was suspended,\r\nendeavoring to gnaw it asunder, and making angry snaps at the persons\r\nwho prevented him. Several heavy blows were struck on the back of his\r\nneck, and a bayonet was thrust through him, yet above a quarter of an\r\nhour elapsed before he died.\"\r\n\r\nHearne, in his journey to the Northern Ocean, says, that the wolves\r\nalways burrow under ground at the breeding season, and though it is\r\nnatural to suppose them very fierce at those times, yet he has\r\nfrequently seen the Indians go to their dens, take out the cubs and play\r\nwith them. These they never hurt, and always scrupulously put them in\r\nthe den again, although they occasionally painted their faces with\r\nvermilion and red ochre, in strange and grotesque patterns.\r\n\r\nThis statement is supported by incidents which have occurred in this\r\nmetropolis; there was a bitch wolf in the Tower Menagerie, which, though\r\nexcessively fond of her cubs, suffered the keepers to handle them, and\r\neven remove them from the den, without evincing the slightest symptom\r\neither of anger or alarm; and a still more remarkable instance is\r\nrelated from observation, by Mr. Bell: \"There was a wolf at the\r\nZoological Gardens (says that able naturalist) which would always come\r\nto the front bars of the den as soon as I or any other person whom she\r\nknew, approached; she had pups, too, and so eager, in fact, was she that\r\nher little ones should share with her in the notice of her friends, that\r\nshe killed all of them in succession by rubbing them against the bars of\r\nher den as she brought them forward to be fondled.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the last year, 8807 wolves' skins were imported by the Hudson's\r\nBay Company from their settlements; of which 8784 came from the York\r\nFort and Mackenzie River stations; we recently had the opportunity of\r\nexamining the stock, and found it principally composed of white wolves'\r\nskins from the Churchill River, with black and gray skins of every\r\nshade. The most valuable are from animals killed in the depth of winter,\r\nand of these, the white skins, which are beautifully soft and fine, are\r\nworth about thirty shillings apiece, and are exported to Hungary, where\r\nthey are in great favor with the nobles as trimming for pelisses and\r\nhussar jackets; the gray wolves' skins are worth from three shillings\r\nand sixpence upward, and are principally exported to America and the\r\nNorth of Europe, to be used as cloak-linings.\r\n\r\nColonel H. Smith mentions a curious instance of the treacherous ferocity\r\nof the wolf. A butcher at New York had brought up, and believed he had\r\ntamed, a wolf, which he kept for above two years chained up in the\r\nslaughterhouse, where it lived in a complete superabundance of blood and\r\noffal. One night, having occasion for some implement which he believed\r\nwas accessible in the dark, he went into this little Smithfield without\r\nthinking of the wolf. He was clad in a thick frieze coat, and while\r\nstooping to grope for what he wanted, he heard the chain rattle, and in\r\na moment was struck down by the animal springing upon him. Fortunately,\r\na favorite cattle-dog had accompanied his master, and rushed forward to\r\ndefend him: the wolf had hold of the man's collar, and being obliged to\r\nturn in his own defense, the butcher had time to draw a large knife,\r\nwith which he ripped his assailant open. The same able writer relates an\r\nincident which occurred to an English gentleman, holding a high public\r\nsituation in the peninsula, during a wolf-hunt in the mountains, near\r\nMadrid. The sportsmen were placed in ambush, and the country-people\r\ndrove the game toward them; presently an animal came bounding upward\r\ntoward this gentleman, so large that he took it, while driving through\r\nthe high grass and bushes, for a donkey; it was a wolf, however, whose\r\nglaring eyes meant mischief, but, scared by the click of the rifle, he\r\nturned and made his escape, though a bullet whistled after him; at the\r\nclose of the hunt seven were found slain, and so large were they that\r\nthis gentleman, though of uncommon strength, could not lift one entirely\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\nThe wolf of America is at times remarkable for cowardice, though bold\r\nenough when pressed by hunger, or with other wolves. Mr. R. C. Taylor,\r\nof Philadelphia, states that this animal, when trapped, is silent,\r\nsubdued, and unresisting. He was present when a fine young wolf, about\r\nfifteen months old, was taken by surprise, and suddenly attacked with a\r\nclub. The animal offered no resistance, but, crouching down in the\r\nsupplicating manner of a dog, suffered himself to be knocked on the\r\nhead. An old hunter told Mr. Taylor that he had frequently taken a wolf\r\nout of the trap, and compelled it by a few blows to lie down by his\r\nside, while he reset his trap.\r\n\r\nThe Esquimaux wolf-trap is made of strong slabs of ice, long and so\r\nnarrow, that a fox can with difficulty turn himself in it, and a wolf\r\nmust actually remain in the position in which he is taken. The door is a\r\nheavy portcullis of ice, sliding in two well-secured grooves of the same\r\nsubstance, and is kept up by a line which, passing over the top of the\r\ntrap, is carried through a hole at the farthest extremity. To the end of\r\nthe line is fastened a small hoop of whale-bone, and to this any kind of\r\nflesh bait is attached. From the slab which terminates the trap, a\r\nprojection of ice, or a peg of bone or wood, points inward near the\r\nbottom, and under this the hoop is slightly hooked; the slightest pull\r\nat the bait liberates it, the door falls in an instant, and the wolf is\r\nspeared where he lies.\r\n\r\nSir John Richardson states that, when near the Copper Mines River in\r\nNorth America, he had more than once an opportunity of seeing a single\r\nwolf in pursuit of a reindeer, and especially on Point Lake, when\r\ncovered with ice, when a fine buck reindeer was overtaken by a large\r\nwhite wolf, and disabled by a bite in the flank. An Indian, who was\r\nconcealed, ran in and cut the deer's throat with his knife, the wolf at\r\nonce relinquishing his prey and sneaking off. In the chase the poor deer\r\nurged its flight by great bounds, which for a time exceeded the speed of\r\nthe wolf; but it stopped so frequently to gaze on its relentless enemy,\r\nthat the latter, toiling on at a long gallop (so admirably described by\r\nByron), with his tongue lolling out of his mouth, gradually came up.\r\nAfter each hasty look, the deer redoubled its efforts to escape, but,\r\neither exhausted by fatigue or enervated by fear, it became, just before\r\nit was overtaken, scarcely able to keep its feet.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lyon gives some interesting illustrations of the habits of the\r\nwolves of Melville Peninsula, which were sadly destructive to his dogs.\r\n\"A fine dog was lost in the afternoon. It had strayed to the hummocks\r\nahead, without its master; and Mr. Elder, who was near the spot, saw\r\nfive wolves rush at, attack, and devour it, in an incredibly short space\r\nof time: before he could reach the place, the carcass was torn in\r\npieces, and he found only the lower part of one leg. The boldness of the\r\nwolves was altogether astonishing, as they were almost constantly seen\r\namong the hummocks, or lying quietly, at no great distance, in wait for\r\nthe dogs. From all we observed, I have no reason to suppose that they\r\nwould attack a single unarmed man, both English and Esquimaux frequently\r\npassing them, without a stick in their hands. The animals, however,\r\nexhibited no symptoms of fear, but rather a kind of tacit agreement not\r\nto be the beginners of a quarrel, even though they might have been\r\ncertain of proving victorious.\"[5] Another time, when pressed by hunger,\r\nthe wolves broke into a snow-hut, in which were a couple of\r\nnewly-purchased Esquimaux dogs, and carried the poor animals off, but\r\nnot without some difficulty; for even the ceiling of the hut was next\r\nmorning found sprinkled with blood and hair. When the alarm was given,\r\nand the wolves were fired at, one of them was observed carrying a dead\r\ndog in his mouth, clear of the ground, and going, with ease, at a\r\ncanter, notwithstanding the animal was of his own weight. It was curious\r\nto observe the fear these dogs seemed, at times, to entertain of wolves.\r\n\r\nDuring Sir John Richardson's residence at Cumberland-house, in 1820, a\r\nwolf, which had been prowling round the fort, was wounded by a\r\nmusket-ball, and driven off, but returned after dark, while the blood\r\nwas still flowing from its wound, and carried off a dog from among fifty\r\nothers, that had not the courage to unite in an attack on their enemy.\r\nThe same writer says, that he has frequently observed an Indian dog,\r\nafter being worsted in combat with a black wolf, retreat into a corner,\r\nand howl, at intervals, for an hour together; these Indian dogs, also,\r\nhowl piteously when apprehensive of punishment, and throw themselves\r\ninto attitudes strongly resembling those of a wolf when caught in a\r\ntrap.\r\n\r\nFoxes are frequently taken in the pitfalls set for wolves, and seem to\r\npossess more cunning. An odd incident is related by Mr. Lloyd: A fox was\r\nlying at the bottom of a pitfall, apparently helpless, when a very stout\r\npeasant, having placed a ladder, began to descend with cautious and\r\ncreaking steps to destroy the vermin. Reynard, however, thought he might\r\nbenefit by the ladder, as well as his corpulent visitor, and, just as\r\nthe latter reached the ground, jumped, first, on his stern, then, on his\r\nshoulder, skipped out of the pit, and was off in a moment, leaving the\r\nman staring and swearing at his impudent escape!\r\n\r\nCaptain Lyon mentions an instance of the sagacity of the fox: he had\r\ncaught and tamed one of these animals, which he kept on deck, in a\r\nsmall hutch, with a scope of chain. Finding himself repeatedly drawn out\r\nof his hutch by this, the sagacious little fellow, whenever he retreated\r\nwithin his castle, took the chain in his mouth, and drew it so\r\ncompletely in after him, that no one, who valued his fingers, would\r\nendeavor to take hold of the end attached to the staple.\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd mentions a curious contest that took place in the vicinity of\r\nUddeholm. A peasant had just got into bed, when his ears were assailed\r\nby a tremendous uproar in his cattle-shed. On hearing this noise, he\r\njumped up, and, though almost in a state of nudity, rushed into the\r\nbuilding to see what was the matter: here he found an immense wolf,\r\nwhich he gallantly seized by the ears, and called out most lustily for\r\nassistance. His wife--the gallant Trulla--came to his aid, armed with a\r\nhatchet, with which she severely wounded the wolf's head; but it was not\r\nuntil she had driven the handle of the hatchet down the animal's throat,\r\nthat she succeeded in dispatching him. During the conflict, the man's\r\nhands and wrists were bitten through and through; and, when seen by Mr.\r\nLloyd, the wounds were not healed.\r\n\r\nLike dogs, wolves are capable of strong attachment; but such instances\r\nare comparatively rare: the most striking, perhaps, was that recorded by\r\nM. Frederick Cuvier, as having come under his notice at the Ménagerie du\r\nRoi at Paris. The wolf in question was brought up as a young dog, became\r\nfamiliar with persons he was in the habit of seeing, and, in particular,\r\nfollowed his master every where, evincing chagrin at his absence,\r\nobeying his voice, and showing a degree of submission scarcely\r\ndiffering, in any respect, from that of the most thoroughly-domesticated\r\ndog. His master, being obliged to be absent for a time, presented his\r\npet to the menagerie, where he was confined in a den. Here he became\r\ndisconsolate, pined, and would scarcely take food; at length, he was\r\nreconciled to his new situation, recovered his health, became attached\r\nto his keepers, and appeared to have forgotten \"auld lang syne,\" when,\r\nafter the lapse of eighteen months, his old master returned. At the\r\nfirst sound of his voice--that well-known, much-loved voice--the wolf,\r\nwhich had not perceived him in a crowd of persons, exhibited the most\r\nlively joy, and, being set at liberty, lavished upon him the most\r\naffectionate caresses, just as the most attached dog would have done.\r\nWith some difficulty, he was enticed to his den. But a second separation\r\nwas followed by similar demonstrations of sorrow to the former; which,\r\nhowever, again yielded to time. Three years passed away, and the wolf\r\nwas living happily with a dog which had been placed with him, when his\r\nmaster again appeared--and again the long-lost, but well-remembered\r\nvoice, was instantly replied to by the most impatient cries, redoubled\r\nas soon as the poor fellow was at liberty. Rushing to his master, he\r\nplaced his fore-feet on his shoulders, licking his face with every mark\r\nof the most lively joy, and menacing the keepers who offered to remove\r\nhim. A third separation, however, took place, but it was too much for\r\nthe poor creature's temper: he became gloomy, refused his food, and, for\r\nsome time, it was feared he would die. Time, however, which blunts the\r\ngrief of wolves, as well as of men, brought comfort to his wounded\r\nheart, and his health gradually returned; but, looking upon mankind as\r\nfalse deceivers, he no longer permitted the caresses of any but his\r\nkeepers, manifesting to all strangers the savageness and moroseness of\r\nhis species.\r\n\r\nAnother instance of the attachment of wolves is mentioned by Mr. Lloyd,\r\nin his work on the Sports of the North. Mr. Greiff, who had studied the\r\nhabits of wild animals, for which his position, as _ofüerjäg mästare_,\r\nafforded peculiar facilities, says: \"I reared up two young wolves until\r\nthey were full-grown: they were male and female. The latter became so\r\ntame, that she played with me, and licked my hands, and I had her often\r\nwith me in the sledge, in winter. Once, when I was absent, she got loose\r\nfrom the chain, and was away three days. When I returned home, I went\r\nout on a hill, and called, 'where's my Tussa?' as she was named, when\r\nshe immediately came home, and fondled with me, like the most friendly\r\ndog.\"\r\n\r\nBetween the dog and the wolf there is a natural enmity, and those\r\nanimals seldom encounter each other on at all equal terms without a\r\ncombat taking place. Should the wolf prove victorious, he devours his\r\nadversary, but if the contrary be the case, the dog leaves untouched the\r\ncarcass of his antagonist.\r\n\r\nThe wolf feeds on the rat, hare, fox, badger, roebuck, stag, reindeer\r\nand elk; likewise upon blackcock and capercali. He is possessed of great\r\nstrength, especially in the muscles of the neck and jaws, is said always\r\nto seize his prey by the throat, and when it happens to be a large\r\nanimal, as the elk, he is often dragged for a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nAfter a deep fall of snow the wolf is unusually ferocious; if he\r\nbesmears himself with the blood of a victim, or is so wounded that blood\r\nflows, it is positively asserted that his companions will instantly kill\r\nand devour him.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1799 a peasant at Frederickshall in Norway was looking out\r\nof his cottage window, when he espied a large wolf enter his premises\r\nand seize one of his goats. At this time he had a child of eighteen\r\nmonths old in his arms; he incautiously laid her down in a small porch\r\nfronting the house, and, catching hold of a stick, the nearest weapon at\r\nhand, attacked the wolf, which was in the act of carrying off the goat.\r\nThe wolf dropped this, and getting sight of the child, in the twinkling\r\nof an eye seized it, threw it across his shoulders, and was off like\r\nlightning. He made good his escape, and not a vestige was ever seen of\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\nWolves are found all over Scandinavia, but are most common in the\r\nMidland and Northern Provinces of Sweden. Like \"Elia,\" they are very\r\npartial to young pig, a failing taken advantage of by sportsmen thus:\r\nthey sew up in a sack a small porker, leaving only his snout free, and\r\nplace him in a sledge, to the back of which is fastened by a rope about\r\nfifty feet long, a small bundle of straw, covered with black sheep skin;\r\nthis, when the sledge is in motion, dangles about like a young pig.\r\n\r\nDuring a very severe winter a party started in the vicinity of\r\nForsbacka, well provided with guns, &c. On reaching a likely spot they\r\npinched the pig, which squealed lustily, and, as they anticipated, soon\r\ndrew a multitude of famished wolves about the sledge. When these had\r\napproached within range the party opened fire on them, and shot several;\r\nall that were either killed or wounded were quickly torn to pieces and\r\ndevoured by their companions, but the blood with which the ravenous\r\nbeasts had now glutted themselves only served to make them more savage\r\nthan before, and, in spite of the fire kept up by the party, they\r\nadvanced close to the sledge, apparently determined on making an instant\r\nattack. To preserve the party, therefore, the pig was thrown to the\r\nwolves, which had for a moment the effect of diverting their attention.\r\nWhile this was going forward, the horse, driven to desperation by the\r\nnear approach of the wolves, struggled and plunged so violently that he\r\nbroke the shafts to pieces, galloped off, and made good his escape. The\r\npig was devoured, and the wolves again threatened to attack the\r\nsportsmen. The captain and his friends finding matters had become\r\nserious, turned the sledge bottom up and took shelter beneath it, in\r\nwhich position they remained many hours, the wolves making repeated\r\nattempts to get at them by tearing the sledge with their teeth, but at\r\nlength the party were relieved by friends from then perilous position.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Oldenburg once witnessed a curious occurrence. He was\r\nstanding near the margin of a large lake which at that time was frozen\r\nover. At some little distance from the land a small aperture had been\r\nmade for the purpose of procuring water, and at this hole a pig was\r\ndrinking. While looking toward the horizon, the lieutenant saw a mere\r\nspeck or ball, as it were, rapidly moving along the ice: presently this\r\ntook the form of a large wolf, which was making for the pig at top\r\nspeed. Lieutenant Oldenburg now seized his gun, and ran to the\r\nassistance of the pig; but before he got up to the spot the wolf had\r\nclosed with the porker, which, though of large size, he tumbled over and\r\nover in a trice. His attention was so much occupied, that Lieutenant\r\nOldenburg was able to approach within a few paces and dispatch him with\r\na shot. A piece as large as a man's foot had been torn out of the pig's\r\nhind quarters; and he was so terribly frightened that he followed the\r\nlieutenant home like a dog, and would not quit his heels for a moment.\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd mentions an incident that befell him, in consequence of swine\r\nmistaking his dogs for wolves, to which they bear the most instinctive\r\nantipathy. One day, in the depth of winter, accompanied by his Irish\r\nservant, he struck into the forest, in the vicinity of Carlstadt, for\r\nthe purpose of shooting capercali. Toward evening they came to a small\r\nhamlet, situated in the recesses of the forest. Here an old sow with her\r\nlitter were feeding; and immediately on seeing the two valuable pointers\r\nwhich accompanied the sportsman, she made a determined and most\r\nferocious dash at them. The servant had a light spear in his hand,\r\nsimilar to that used by our lancers. This Mr. Lloyd seized, and\r\ndirecting Paddy to throw the dogs over a fence, received the charge of\r\nthe pig with a heavy blow across the snout with the butt end of the\r\nspear. Nothing daunted, she made her next attack upon him; and, in\r\nself-defense, he was obliged to give her a home thrust with the blade of\r\nthe spear. These attacks she repeated three several times, always\r\ngetting the spear up to the hilt in her head or neck. Then, and not\r\nbefore, did she slowly retreat, bleeding at all points. The peasants,\r\nsupposing Mr. Lloyd to be the aggressor, assumed a very hostile aspect,\r\nand it was only by showing a bold bearing, and menacing them with his\r\ngun, that he escaped in safety.\r\n\r\nA poor soldier was one day, in the depth of winter, crossing the large\r\nlake called Storsyön, and was attacked by a drove of wolves. His only\r\nweapon was a sword, with which he defended himself so gallantly, that he\r\nkilled and wounded several wolves, and succeeded in driving off the\r\nremainder. After a time, he was again attacked by the same drove, but\r\nwas now unable to extricate himself from his perilous situation in the\r\nsame manner as before, for having neglected to wipe the blood from his\r\nsword after the former encounter, it had become firmly frozen to the\r\nscabbard. The ferocious beasts therefore, quickly closed with him,\r\nkilled and devoured him. If we remember aright, Captain Kincaid, the\r\npresent gallant Exon of the Yeoman Guard, nearly lost his life at\r\nWaterloo, from a somewhat similar cause. He had been skirmishing all the\r\nearlier part of the day with the Rifles, when a sudden charge of French\r\ncavalry placed him in great danger. He essayed to draw his sabre, tugged\r\nand tugged, but the trusty steel had become firmly rusted to the\r\nscabbard; and we believe that he owed his life to an accidental\r\ndiversion of the attention of the attacking troopers.\r\n\r\nClosely resembling in many respects the wolf, the jackal is widely\r\nspread over India, Asia, and Africa. These animals hunt in packs, and\r\nthere are few sounds more startling to the unaccustomed ear, than a\r\nchorus of their cries. \"We hardly know,\" says Captain Beechey, \"a sound\r\nwhich partakes less of harmony than that which is at present in\r\nquestion; and, indeed, the sudden burst of the answering long protracted\r\nscream, succeeding immediately to the opening note, is scarcely less\r\nimpressive than the roll of the thunder clap immediately after a flash\r\nof lightning. The effect of this music is very much increased when the\r\nfirst note is heard in the distance, a circumstance which often occurs,\r\nand the answering yell bursts out from several points at once, within a\r\nfew yards or feet of the place where the auditors are sleeping.\"\r\n\r\nPoultry and the smaller animals, together with dead bodies, are the\r\nordinary food of jackals, but when rendered bold by hanger, they will\r\noccasionally attack the larger quadrupeds and even man.\r\n\r\nA bold, undaunted presence and defiant aspect, generally proves the best\r\nprotection when an unarmed man is threatened by these or other animals,\r\nbut artifice is sometimes necessary. A ludicrous instance is related by\r\nan old quartermaster (whom we knew some years ago), in a small volume of\r\nmemoirs. At Christmas, 1826, he was sent up the country to a mission,\r\nabout thirty-two miles from San Francisco. He and the others erected a\r\ntent; after which they all lay down on the ground. \"I slept like a top,\"\r\nsays he, \"till four the next morning, at which time I was awakened by\r\nthe man whose duty it was to officiate as cook for the day, who told me\r\nif I would go up the village and get a light, he would have a good\r\nbreakfast ready for the lads by the time they awoke. I must describe my\r\ndress, for that very dress saved my life. Over the rest of my clothing,\r\nas a seaman, I had a huge frock made from the skin of a reindeer. It was\r\nlong enough, when let down, to cover my feet well, and turned up at\r\nfoot, buttoning all round the skirt. At the top was a hood, made from\r\nthe skin, taken off the head of a bear, ears and all. In front was a\r\nsquare lappel, which, in the day, hung loosely over the breast, but at\r\nnight, buttoned just behind the ears, leaving only the mouth, nose, and\r\neyes free for respiration, so that one, with such a dress, might lie\r\ndown any where and sleep, warm and comfortable. Mr. S---- had given\r\neight dollars for it in Kamtschatka, and, on our return to more genial\r\nclimes, forgot the future, and gave it to me. Fancy, then, my figure\r\nthus accoutred, issuing from under the canvas tent, with a lantern in my\r\nhand. I had not advanced twenty yards, when first only two or three, and\r\nthen an immense number of jackals surrounded me. I was at first disposed\r\nto think but lightly of them: but seeing their numbers increase so\r\nrapidly, I grew alarmed, and probably gave way to fear sooner than I\r\nought. A few shots from the tent would probably have sent them away with\r\nspeed, but no one saw me. Every moment they drew closer and closer in a\r\ncomplete round, and seemed to look at me with determined hunger. For\r\nsome moments I remained in a most dreadful state of alarm. It just then\r\noccurred to me that I once heard of a boy who had driven back a bull out\r\nof a field by walking backward on his hands and feet. Fortunate thought!\r\nI caught at the idea; in a moment I was on all fours, with my head as\r\nnear the earth as I could keep it, and commenced cutting all the capers\r\nof which I was capable. The jackals, who no doubt had never seen so\r\nstrange an animal, first stopped, then retreated, and, as I drew near\r\nthe tent, flew in all directions. The men awoke just in time to see my\r\ndanger, and have a hearty laugh at me and the jackals.\"\r\n\r\nOur old friend was more fortunate than a certain youth who attempted to\r\nrob an orchard by deluding a fierce bulldog with this approach _à\r\nposteriori,_ but who, to his sorrow, found the dog too knowing, for he\r\ncarried to his dying day the marks of the guardian's teeth in that spot\r\nwhere honor has its seat.\r\n\r\nThe same quartermaster told us a quaint story of a fright another of the\r\ncrew received from these jackals.\r\n\r\nWhile at San Francisco the ship's crew were laying in a store of\r\nprovisions; a large tent was erected on shore for salting the meat; the\r\ncooper lived in it, and hung up his hammock at one end. The beef which\r\nhad been killed during the day was also hung up all around, in readiness\r\nfor salting. One night a large pack of jackals came down from the woods,\r\nand being attracted by the smell of the meat, soon got into the tent,\r\nand pulling at one of the sides of beef, brought it down with a crash,\r\nwhich woke the old cooper, who was a remarkably stout, and rather\r\nnervous man. Finding himself thus surrounded in the dead of the night by\r\nwild beasts, whose forms and size, dimly seen, were magnified by his\r\nfears, he fired off his musket, and clasping his arms, in an agony of\r\nterror, round a quarter of beef which hung close to his hammock, was\r\nfound perfectly senseless by an officer who came to see the cause of the\r\nalarm. Some difficulty was experienced in getting him to relinquish his\r\nhold of the beef--which he stuck to like a Briton--and it was several\r\ndays before his nerves recovered from the shock of the fright.\r\n\r\nThe wolf and the jackal tribes are by no means without their use in the\r\neconomy of nature, though from their predatory habits they are justly\r\nregarded as pests in the countries they infest: that they will disturb\r\nthe dead and rifle the graves is true, but they also clear away offal,\r\nand with vultures, are the scavengers of hot countries; they follow on\r\nthe track of herds, and put a speedy end to the weak, the wounded, and\r\nthe dying; they are the most useful, though most disgusting of camp\r\nfollowers, and after a battle, when thousands of corpses of men and\r\nhorses are collected within a limited space, they are of essential\r\nservice--\r\n\r\n    I stood in a swampy-field of battle,\r\n    With bones and skulls I made a rattle\r\n    To frighten the wolf and carrion crow\r\n    And the homeless dog--but they would not go;\r\n    So off I flew--for how could I bear\r\n    To see them gorge their dainty fare.\r\n                               COLERIDGE.\r\n\r\nRevolting and heart-sickening though such scenes may be, the evil is\r\nless than would result from the undisturbed decay of the dead: were that\r\nto take place, the air would hang heavy with pestilence, and the winds\r\nof heaven laden with noisome exhalations would carry death and\r\ndesolation far and near, rendering still more terrible the horrors and\r\ncalamities of war.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Fauna Boreali Americana, p. 62.\r\n\r\n[2] Holland's Plinie's Naturall Historie, ed. 1635\r\n\r\n[3] Edit, Edin. 1541, quoted from Magazine of Natural History.\r\n\r\n[4] Private Journal of Captain G.

Being badly wounded, he was\r\nremoved to the military hospital, but the ladies were received into the\r\nprivate house of Madame Strognof, whose husband held, at that time, a\r\nsubordinate appointment under the Russian Government.\r\n\r\nA certain Botwinko was then procureur at Vitebsk. Without the\r\nprocureur's sanction nothing can be done in his department; for he\r\nrepresents the emperor himself, and is usually called \"the eye of His\r\nMajesty.\" His salary is only about twenty-five pounds a year; but he\r\nmakes, usually, a good income by receiving bribes. Among other duties,\r\nhe had to visit the hospitals daily, and to report upon the condition of\r\nthe prisoner patients. He paid great attention to the unhappy general,\r\nwho required every consolation; for, despite his own deplorable\r\ncondition, it was decreed that he should outlive his wife. That lady\r\ncaught a contagious fever, which was raging at that time at Vitebsk, and\r\ndied in a few hours. This event so distressed the general that he soon\r\ndeparted this world, with the only consolation, that Procureur Botwinko,\r\na married but childless man, would adopt his daughter. This promise was\r\nactually fulfilled, and the little orphan was taken from Madame\r\nStrognof, and established under the procureur's roof. Her parents'\r\nproperty, consisting of a carriage, horses, jewelry, and no small sum of\r\nready money, was also taken possession of by Botwinko in quality of\r\nguardian to the little orphan.\r\n\r\nAs the girl, whom they called \"Sophie,\" grew up, she became very\r\nengaging, and was kindly treated by Mr. and Madame Botwinko. She never\r\nlost an opportunity, when any visitors were in the procureur's house, of\r\npraising her protectors for their kindness to her; and this, connected\r\nwith other circumstances, contributed to the promotion of Mr. Botwinko,\r\nwho obtained the more profitable situation of procureur-general at\r\nVilna, the capital of Lithuania.\r\n\r\nRemoval from their old connections, and from those who knew all the\r\ncircumstances of little Sophie's history, produced a change in the\r\ntreatment of the new procureur-general and his wife toward the child.\r\nTheir kindness rapidly diminished. Sophie was not allowed to appear in\r\nthe drawing-rooms, in their new residence at Vilna. They incessantly\r\nfound fault with her; and, ultimately, she was not only sent to the\r\nkitchen under the control of the cook, but, on the census of the\r\npopulation being taken, in 1816, her name was inscribed on the books as\r\nthat of a serf.\r\n\r\nAs the poor girl grew up she became used to the duties imposed upon\r\nher. Associating constantly with the servants, they considered her their\r\nequal, and taunted her when, relying on her infantine recollections, she\r\nlaid claim to noble descent, by calling her in derision \"Mademoiselle\r\nFrench General.\" She knew full well that she was entitled to better\r\ntreatment, and that, in the absence of paternal authority, she had the\r\nright of disposing of herself according to her own will. A strong\r\ninducement to alter her condition was presented in the person of a young\r\nclerk in a government office, whose duty sometimes brought him with\r\npapers to the procureur for signature. While Botwinko was engaged with\r\nhis breakfast and the perusal of the papers, this clerk was sometimes\r\nkept dangling for hours in the ante-chamber. After a time, these hours\r\nwere agreeably spent in the society of Sophie, to whom he eventually\r\nmade a proposal of marriage. She consented, but, unwilling to leave her\r\nguardian like a fugitive, she apprised him of her determination, and\r\nhumbly requested an account of the property which she had been informed\r\nhe had taken charge of at her parents' death.\r\n\r\nThe procureur-general at first excused himself from giving her an\r\nimmediate answer. The next day he presented himself at the police\r\noffice, the whole of whose functionaries were under his control. What he\r\nsaid or did is not known, but the result was that Sophie was taken into\r\ncustody by the police, and committed to jail.\r\n\r\nMany months elapsed before her fate was known at home. It was stated\r\nthat she absconded. The clerk, banished the procureur's house, could not\r\ndiscover the cause of the girl's disappearance; and as all Russian\r\ncriminal proceedings are conducted with great secrecy, he only\r\nascertained by a mere accident that the girl had been sentenced, by a\r\nsuperior court, to receive a certain number of lashes by the knout, and\r\nto be sent to Siberia. The crime of which they accused her was that of\r\nattempting to poison her master and mistress.\r\n\r\nAlarmed at this information, the young man, without waiting for more\r\nparticulars, addressed a petition to the war governor of Vilna--the old\r\nGeneral Korsakof--whose power in that province was almost omnipotent,\r\nand, if not misdirected, was very often beneficial to the inhabitants.\r\nThe petitioner requested the general's interference, and an\r\ninvestigation of the case, assuring him that the girl was innocent, and\r\nthat the legal authorities who condemned her had been corrupted.\r\n\r\nThe general was accustomed to decide every case _en militaire_. He had\r\nreceived from the police court an unfavorable opinion of the\r\npetitioner's character, which was described as \"restless;\" and was,\r\nmoreover, rather offended at his authority having been appealed to by a\r\nsubordinate. He therefore settled the business summarily, by sending the\r\nyoung petitioner to the military service for life, in virtue of the\r\nvagrant act.\r\n\r\nStill the young man's petition produced a good effect: the poor girl was\r\nnot flogged, lest that might have provoked some disturbance in the town.\r\nShe was merely dressed in convict's apparel, and sent off to Siberia.\r\n\r\nThe transport of Russian convicts costs the government but very little.\r\nThey go on foot, sleep in _étapes_ or barracks, and the daily allowance\r\nfor their subsistence amounts only to five kopecks--equal to a halfpenny\r\nin English money. This they, as well as the poor old soldiers who escort\r\nthem, have to eke out by charity. For that purpose, the most attractive\r\nperson among each party of exiles is delegated--box in hand, but with an\r\narmed soldier behind--to beg alms of the benevolent; and Sophie was\r\nappointed to be the suppliant for the rest of her wretched companions.\r\n\r\nThe road from Vilna to Siberia passes through Vitebsk. The convicts had\r\nnot been long in the town before Sophie encountered Madame Strognof, who\r\nrecognized the girl from her very great likeness to her mother, who had\r\ndied in that lady's house. When she learned that Sophie had been living\r\nwith the Botwinkos, she had no longer a doubt.\r\n\r\nThe girl asserted her innocence of the pretended crime for which she was\r\non her way to Siberia, with tearful energy, and the good Madame S.\r\nbelieved her; but her husband, who was at that time the Vice-Governor of\r\nVitebsk, to disabuse his wife's romantic dreams, as he called them, sent\r\nfor the officer escorting the prisoners, and showed her the list of\r\nprisoners, which contained a full record, not only of the crime imputed\r\nto the orphan girl, but also of the punishment to which she had been\r\ncondemned.\r\n\r\nIn the face of an official document which appeared to be regular, and\r\nwhich detailed the girl's presumed offense with circumstantial\r\nconsistency, Madame Strognof began to waver in her belief of Sophie's\r\nprotestations; but the unfortunate girl asserted her innocence so\r\nstrongly and incessantly, that the vice-governor himself was at length\r\ninduced to look into the facts. The first suspicion that entered his\r\nmind was derived from the circumstance of the document stating that the\r\nculprit had been punished with the knout, while it was evident from her\r\nappearance, that that dreadful torture had not been inflicted. He caused\r\na medical man to examine her, who testified that not a scar appeared;\r\nyet the knout always leaves ineffaceable traces for life.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this discrepancy, Sophie was allowed to remain for\r\nsome time at Vitebsk under the plea of illness; which, at the request of\r\nthe vice-governor, was readily certified by an official surgeon. After\r\nsome delay, a memorial was forwarded by the unfortunate sufferer to the\r\nlate Emperor Alexander, in consequence of which a court-messenger was\r\nsent immediately to Vilna. This gentleman brought back to St.\r\nPetersburgh an enormous volume, containing the so-called depositions,\r\ntaken at the pseudo trial. After careful inspection of them, the\r\nemperor decided that they proved the legality of the proceedings. So\r\nartfully were these infamous depositions framed; that, among them,\r\nappeared the formula of a chemical analysis of the poison which the girl\r\nwas accused of administering, and a full confession; to which the\r\nculprit's signature was forged.\r\n\r\nThe answer, therefore, from the throne was not only unfavorable; but the\r\nauthorities of Vitebsk were reprimanded for allowing the girl to\r\nimportune his majesty without sufficient grounds.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, Madame Strognof was not discouraged; and, to the great\r\nalarm of her husband, had another petition drawn up and forwarded with a\r\nsuitable memorial to the Princess Maria Fedorowna, the emperor's mother,\r\nwho was known to all the country as a pious and charitable lady. This\r\npetition, presented to his majesty by his own mother, had so great an\r\ninfluence over him, that he ordered the girl to be brought to St.\r\nPetersburgh. He felt convinced that some unaccountable mystery was\r\ninvolved in the case.\r\n\r\nIn due time Sophie arrived at St. Petersburgh, and underwent a rigid\r\nexamination. She asseverated with the most earnest truthfulness, that\r\nall the depositions were fictitious; that the chemical analysis was a\r\nwicked invention; and that the signature to her fabricated confession\r\nwas a forgery. She also denied that any trial had taken place, or that\r\nshe had been examined in any court whatever. Upon this, the emperor\r\nappointed Mr. Getzewicz, the Governor of Minsk--who was known as a most\r\ntrust-worthy man--to go personally to Vilna; to investigate the case;\r\nand to report the result. For this purpose the papers and the girl were\r\nforwarded back to Vilna.\r\n\r\nThe mission of Mr. Getzewicz was by no means an easy or a pleasant one:\r\nhe had to contend with a swarm of official insects; which, like Canadian\r\nmusquitoes when disturbed, attack the new comer from every side.\r\nHowever, Mr. Getzewicz stood his ground firmly. He soon discovered that\r\nthe secretary of the police court who had drawn up the depositions was a\r\nconvict, sentenced for life to Siberia for having been associated with\r\nhighway robbers. He had escaped and was retained in his situation by\r\nmerely changing his Christian name, and by being reported \"dead\" by Mr.\r\nBotwinko. The components of the rest of the court were no less\r\nsuspicious. In Russia, the police and sheriff's courts, and even the\r\nprovincial senate itself, are the asylums for military veterans; who,\r\nduring their long service, had never been trained up to the law. The\r\nsecretaries draw documents for them, which they sign--very often without\r\nreading; that task being tiresome, and often incomprehensible to them.\r\n\r\nThe court which had promoted and confirmed Sophie's prosecution,\r\nconsisted of illiterate, worn-out officers, who had no scruple in\r\ncommitting the procureur-general's victim for trial to the First\r\nCriminal Court (Sond Grodoski).\r\n\r\nBut how was the deception carried on before the higher tribunals? This\r\nwould puzzle the most ingenious rascality to guess. But Botwinko was a\r\ngenius in his way: he actually brought before that court, as well as\r\nbefore the highest criminal tribunal, another young woman; who\r\nrepresented herself to be the girl in question, and confessed her\r\nsupposed guilt with all the desired particulars. The extraordinary\r\nintrigue was the more easily accomplished from the secrecy with which\r\ncriminal investigations in Russia are conducted. Whenever the culprit\r\nacknowledges his crime, the sentence follows without further inquiry;\r\nand, the jail being under the control of the police-office, and the\r\njudges of the criminal courts not knowing the prisoners personally, they\r\nwere obliged to receive in this instance the confessions of any girl\r\nwhom the police thought proper to send to them.\r\n\r\nWhen the trial was over, the procureur paid his hireling well, dismissed\r\nher, and drew forth his victim from her cell; substituted her for the\r\nwretch who had stood at the bar, and sent her to Siberia. Villainy,\r\nhowever, be it ever so cunning, seldom half does its work of deception.\r\nIf Botwinko had had the whole sentence carried into effect, and poor\r\nSophie knouted, he would not, perhaps, have been discovered by his\r\ncolleague at Vitebsk; and he might have lived a respected public officer\r\nto this day; for of such characters does the Russian system admit the\r\nprosperous existence. As it was, however, on the report of Mr.\r\nGetzewicz, Botwinko, the secretary of police, and many of his superiors,\r\nwere thrown into prison.\r\n\r\nThe end of this dreadful story is melancholy; for in the end guilt\r\ntriumphed. The procureur-general, having several partners in his guilty\r\npractices, had, if one may so abuse the expression, many friends. At\r\nfirst they tried most ingeniously to bribe Mr. Getzewicz, and to induce\r\nhim to give up further proceedings; but, finding him inflexible, they\r\nput a stop to all that business by administering poison to the\r\nunfortunate Sophie. They even threatened the Governor of Minsk himself,\r\nin an anonymous letter, to do the same for him.\r\n\r\nThat threat, it seems, produced the desired effect on the honest but\r\nweak-minded man. Seeing with what desperate people he had to contend--so\r\nmuch so, that his own life was in danger--he sent his final report to\r\nthe (at that time) lingering Emperor Alexander, with request for further\r\ninstructions. In the mean time he retired to his own residence at Minsk,\r\nleaving the illustrious Vilna officials in their own prison.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward, the emperor died at Taganrog. His second brother, the\r\npresent emperor, Nicholas I.--greeted, on his accession to the throne,\r\nwith a formidable insurrection at St Petersburgh, and with alarming\r\nconspiracies and political intrigues in the army--had no time to direct\r\nhis attention to so trifling an affair as that of our heroine. Political\r\nprisoners were to be punished first, in order to spread terror among\r\nthose who were not discovered as yet. The stability of the throne would\r\nnot allow him to alarm the administrative servants and other criminals\r\nwho never thought of subverting Romanoff's dynasty. Hence, with the\r\nexception of the political offenders, all others, whose actions were\r\npending in different courts of justice, but not yet adjudicated, were\r\namnestied by the emperor, on the occasion of his coronation, in 1826, at\r\nMoscow.\r\n\r\nThus, the procureur and his associates were released from prison, losing\r\nnothing but their former situations. The procureur, having scraped\r\ntogether a fortune by his bribes and graspings, did not care much at\r\nbecoming an independent gentleman.\r\n\r\nWhat became of Sophie's lover--the unfortunate clerk, who was sent to\r\nthe army, for his honest but untimely application--could not be learned.\r\nHe may now think that his punishment was deserved, and that the girl was\r\nreally guilty; but it is more than probable that he will never again\r\ninterfere to restrain the grossest injustice.\r\n\r\nAnd here ends our melancholy tale, which the censorship of the press in\r\nRussia prevented from ever before being publicly related. Corroboration\r\ncan, however, be derived from the inhabitants of Vilna, who lived there\r\nfrom 1816 to 1826; from the archives of criminal courts of that place,\r\nwhere M. Getzewicz's correspondence is preserved; from the list of all\r\nthe crown servants of Russia, sent every year to the State Secretary of\r\nthe Home Department at St. Petersburgh; in which, for 1825 and 1826,\r\nProcureur Botwinko was reported to be imprisoned at Vilna for the above\r\ncase, and that the Strapchy of Oszmiana was acting in his stead as\r\nprocureur _pro tem._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNAPOLEON AND THE POPE.--A SCENE AT FONTAINEBLEAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1804, the court was at Fontainebleau. The Consulate had\r\nbut recently merged in the Empire, with the consent of all the orders of\r\nthe state. The senate by a decree had declared the First Consul to be\r\nEmperor of the French; and the people, to whom the question of\r\nsuccession had been deferred, had, by a majority of three millions to\r\nthree thousand, decided that the imperial dignity should be hereditary\r\nin his family. History, as Alison observes when recording the fact,\r\naffords no instance of a nation having so unanimously taken refuge from\r\nthe ills of agitation and anarchy under the cold shade of despotism.\r\n\r\nA new order of things having commenced, all, as may easily be imagined,\r\nwas in a state of transformation and change in the composition of the\r\ncourt, as well as in the arrangement of the imperial household. Under\r\nthe republican _régime_, a great degree of simplicity had prevailed in\r\nthe appointments of the various departments of the state, as well as in\r\nthe domestic economy of family circles: it could not, however, be\r\ncalled unpretending; there was a certain affectation in it, evidently\r\nassumed with a view to contrast, even in minute particulars, the system\r\nof the republic with that of the old monarchy--the plainness of the one\r\nwith the profuseness of the other. But this was not fated to last long:\r\nit had already been giving way under the Consulate, and was now\r\ndisappearing altogether in accordance with the views of the new monarch.\r\nTitles and dignities were to be restored; court formalities and\r\nceremonials were being revived, and new ones instituted. The old\r\nnobility, sprung from the feudal system, and dating, as some of them\r\ndid, from the Crusades, having been swept away by the revolutionary\r\nstorm, their places were to be supplied, as supporters of the throne, by\r\na new race of men. During this period of transition and change, the\r\nmovement at the château was unceasing. Arrivals and departures were\r\ntaking place almost every hour, to which very different degrees of\r\nimportance were attached. One arrival, however, was spoken of as having\r\na more than ordinary interest: it was that of the dignitary who, as it\r\nwas then understood, was to place the imperial crown on the brow of the\r\nnew sovereign. \"To recall,\" observes Alison, \"as Napoleon was anxious to\r\ndo on every occasion, the memory of Charlemagne, the first French\r\nEmperor of the West, the Pope had been invited, with an urgency which it\r\nwould not have been prudent to resist, to be present at the\r\nconsecration, and had accordingly crossed the Alps for the purpose.\"\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the views which originally prompted the\r\ninvitation--whether it was to play a mere secondary part in a court\r\npageant, or a leading one, as the public at first supposed--or whether\r\nall such notions were swept away by some new deluge of ideas, as\r\nChâteaubriand somewhere says--\"It is now pretty clear that the presence\r\nof the pontiff at the ceremony was a minor consideration, and that the\r\nreal motive was that which came out in their interview, as will appear\r\nin the sequel.\" Be this as it may, it was evident to all that the\r\nemperor awaited his coming with impatience; and when his approach was\r\nannounced--though preparations had been carefully made for their first\r\nmeeting--the arrangements were such as to give it the air of an\r\n_imprévu_. It was on the road some distance from Fontainebleau that the\r\nemperor met the Pope: the potentate alighted from his horse, the pontiff\r\nfrom his traveling chaise, and a coach being at hand, as if\r\naccidentally, they ascended its steps at the same moment from opposite\r\nsides, so that precedence was neither taken nor given. How Italian the\r\nartifice!\r\n\r\nThey had not ridden long together when Bonaparte, quitting the coach,\r\ngot on horseback, and returned to the château at a gallop, and with\r\nscarcely an attendant. The drum beat to arms, the guard turned out, but\r\nbefore they had time to fall in and salute, he had alighted, and was\r\nmounting the steps of the vestibule.\r\n\r\nIt was always so with him; he gave such vivacity to all his movements,\r\nsuch energy to all his actions, that speed seemed a necessary condition\r\nof his existence. Still so natural was it to him, that it did not wear\r\nthe semblance of hurry. Scarcely had the beat of the drum been heard at\r\nthe gate, before the clatter of his heels resounded in the hall, as the\r\nflash of a cannon precedes the report.\r\n\r\nThis time, however, he seemed fitful and even agitated. On entering the\r\nsaloon, he paced it like one who waited with impatience. Having taken a\r\nfew turns from one end to the other, he moved to a window, and began\r\nbeating a march with his fingers on the window-frame. The rolling of a\r\ncarriage was heard in the court, he ceased to beat, and after a short\r\npause stamped on the floor, as if impatient at seeing something done too\r\nslowly; then stepping hastily to the door, opened it--it was for the\r\nPope.\r\n\r\nPius VII. entered alone; Bonaparte closed the door after him. The Pope\r\nwas tall, but stooped somewhat; his countenance, elongated and sallow,\r\nwore an expression of suffering, which seemed to have been induced upon\r\na habitual tone of elevation and courtesy. His eyes were black and\r\nlarge, and on his lips, which were slightly opened, played a smile\r\nindicative at once of urbanity and benevolence. He wore on his head a\r\nwhite calotte or headpiece, partially covering his hair, which was\r\nnaturally black, but now blended with some silver locks; on his\r\nshoulders he had a camail, or cape of red velvet, and his long robe\r\nreached to his feet. Those who have seen his portrait by Lawrence,\r\nthough taken ten or eleven years later, will recognize at once the\r\ncorrectness of this description. As he entered the room he moved slowly,\r\nwith a calm and measured step like that of an aged female; and having\r\ntaken his seat in an arm-chair, he turned his eyes toward the floor, and\r\nseemed to wait for what the other Italian was going to say.\r\n\r\nBonaparte, as all know, was short in stature, being below the middle\r\nheight; but in all other respects he was, at the period here referred\r\nto, very different in personal appearance from what he became\r\nsubsequently. Far from having that fullness which approached to\r\ncorpulence--that sallow puffiness of cheek which verged on the\r\nunhealthy--or that heaviness of limb, or general obesity, which\r\nthreatened infirmity--he was slender in frame, but firm and\r\nwell-proportioned; yet there was something which indicated premature\r\nwear, by hardship in the field and toil in the cabinet; he was quick and\r\nnervous in every movement, rapid and almost convulsive in his gestures\r\nwhen excited. Still he could be at any time graceful in attitude, and\r\nelegant in manner. Even then he stooped a little, so that his shoulders\r\ninclined forward, which gave something of flatness to his chest. His\r\nface was thin and elongated; but what a forehead! What eyes! What beauty\r\nin the contour of his intellectual visage! In repose, its habitual\r\nexpression was reflective and concentrated, with a strong tinge of\r\nmelancholy.\r\n\r\nBonaparte ceased not to pace the room after the Pope had entered. After\r\na while, altering his curve somewhat, and having taken a turn round the\r\nchair, as if making a _reconnaissance,_ he stopped short, and resumed\r\nthe thread of the conversation which had been commenced in the carriage,\r\nand abruptly broken off.\r\n\r\n\"I repeat, holy father, I am not an _esprit fort_, nor do I like\r\nword-spinners or idea-mongers. I assure you, that in spite of my old\r\nrepublicans I will go to mass.\"\r\n\r\nThese words he tossed off toward the Pope, as if he were giving him a\r\ndash of the incense-box; then paused to observe their effect. He seemed\r\nto imagine that, after the impieties of the republican _régime_, such an\r\navowal ought to produce a decided effect.\r\n\r\nPius, however, remained unmoved; he continued as before to look steadily\r\ndownward, and pressing firmly with his hands the eagle-heads that tipped\r\nthe arms of his chair, seemed, in thus assuming the fixity of a statue,\r\nto say, \"I must submit to listen to all the profane things which it may\r\nplease him to say to me.\"\r\n\r\nSeeing this, Bonaparte took a turn round the room, and another round the\r\nchair, which stood in the middle of it, appearing but little satisfied\r\nwith his adversary, and still less with himself for the tone of levity\r\nwith which he had resumed the conversation. He at once changed his\r\nmanner, and began to speak more composedly, still continuing to pace the\r\nroom. As he passed to and fro, he glanced at the mirrors which\r\nornamented the walls, and reflected the grave visage of the pontiff,\r\neying him now and then in profile, never in front, to avoid appearing\r\nanxious as to the impression his words may make.\r\n\r\n\"One thing I must say, holy father, hangs heavily upon me: it is that\r\nyou seem to consent to the coronation by constraint, as you did formerly\r\nto the concordat. As you sit there before me, you have the air of a\r\nmartyr, and assume an attitude of resignation, as if you were making an\r\noffering of your sorrows up to Heaven. But surely you are not a\r\nprisoner; such is not your position in any sense: grand Dieu! you are\r\nfree as air.\"\r\n\r\nPius smiled, and looked him full in the face. He seemed to feel how\r\nenormous was the exigence of that despotic character, which\r\nrequires--and all such natures do the like--not only obedience, but\r\nsubmission, absolute submission, and that, too, wearing the air of\r\ndevotion to their will.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" continued Bonaparte with increasing energy, \"you are free,\r\nperfectly free: you may return to Rome; the road is open to you; no one\r\ndetains you.\"\r\n\r\nPius sighed, slightly raised his right hand, and looked upward without\r\nuttering a word; then slowly inclining his head downward, seemed to look\r\nattentively at a golden cross which hung from his neck. Bonaparte\r\ncontinued speaking, but his steps became slow, and at the same time he\r\ngave a marked degree of mildness to his tone, and of courtesy to his\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\"Holy father,\" said he, \"if the gravity of your character did not forbid\r\nme, I would say that you are somewhat ungrateful. You do not seem to\r\nretain a sufficient recollection of the services which France has\r\nrendered to you. If I am not much mistaken the conclave of Venice, which\r\nelected you, appeared to have taken its inspiration from my Italian\r\ncampaign, and from some words which I let fall with regard to you. It\r\ncan not be said that Austria behaved well to you; far from it; and I was\r\nreally sorry for it. If my memory does not deceive me, you were obliged\r\nto return to Rome by sea, as you could not have ventured to cross the\r\nAustrian territories.\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, as if waiting for a reply from his silent guest. Pius,\r\nhowever, but slightly inclined his head, and then sunk back into a sort\r\nof apathy, which seemed inconsistent with even listening; while\r\nBonaparte, putting his foot on the rim of a stool, pushed it near the\r\nPope's chair, and thus continued, \"It was, in good truth, as a Catholic\r\nthat such an incident gave me pain; for though I have never had time to\r\nstudy theology, I have great confidence in the power of the church: it\r\nhas a prodigious vitality. Voltaire did it some damage in his time, but\r\nI shall let loose upon him some unfrocked Oratorians: you'll be pleased,\r\nif I mistake not, at the result. Now see, you and I may do many things\r\nin common by-and-by, if you wish it.\" Then with an air at once juvenile\r\nand careless, he continued, \"For my part I do not see--I am weary of\r\nconjecturing--what objection you can have to establish your see in\r\nParis, as it formerly was in Avignon. I will cede to you the palace of\r\nthe Tuilleries: I seldom occupy it. You will find there your apartments\r\nprepared for you, as at Monte Cavallo. Do you not see, padre, that Paris\r\nis the real capital of the world? As for me, I shall do whatever you\r\ndesire. You will find in me more docility than people give me credit\r\nfor. Provided that war and politics, with their fatigues, be left to me,\r\nyou may settle the church as you please: I shall be a soldier at your\r\norders. Do but consider what effect it would have, and how brilliant it\r\nwould be, were we to hold our councils as Constantine and Charlemagne\r\ndid in their time! I should merely open and close them, leaving the keys\r\nof the world in your hands. As with the sword I came, the sword I should\r\nretain, and with it the privilege of bringing it back for your\r\nbenediction after every victory achieved by our arms.\" And saying these\r\nwords he slightly bowed.\r\n\r\nPius, who up to that moment had remained motionless as a statue, slowly\r\nraised his head, smiled pensively, and drawing a deep sigh, breathed out\r\none by one the syllables of the word, \"_Com-me-di-an-te!_\"\r\n\r\nThe word was scarcely half out, when Bonaparte made a bound on the floor\r\nlike a wounded leopard. A towering passion seized him; he became yellow\r\nwith ire. He bit his lips almost to bleeding as he strode to the end of\r\nthe room. He no longer paced round in circles; he went straight from\r\nend to end without uttering a word, stamping with his feet as he swept\r\nalong, and making the room resound as he struck the floor with his\r\nspurred heels. Every thing around him seemed to vibrate; the very\r\ncurtains waved like trees in a storm. At length the pent-up rage found\r\nvent, and burst forth like a bombshell which explodes, \"Comedian, say\r\nyou? Ah, ha! I am he that will play you comedies to make you weep like\r\nwomen and children. Comedian, indeed! But you are greatly mistaken if\r\nyou think you can play off on me, with impunity, your cool-blooded\r\ninsolence. Comedian! Where is my theatre, pray, and what? 'Tis the\r\nworld, and the part which I play is that of master and author; while for\r\nactors I have the whole of you--popes, kings, and people; and the cord\r\nby which I move you all is--_fear!_ Comedian, say you? But he who would\r\ndare to hiss me or applaud should be made of different stuff from you,\r\nSignor Chiaramonti! Know you not well that you would still be merely a\r\npoor curé but for me, and that if I did not wear a serious air when I\r\nsalute you, France would laugh and scorn yourself and your tiara? Three\r\nor four years ago, who would pronounce aloud the name of the founder of\r\nyour system? Pray, then, who would have spoken of the pope? Comedian,\r\neh! Sire, ye take footing rather quickly among us. And so, forsooth, you\r\nare in ill-humor with me because I am not dolt enough to sign away the\r\nliberties of the Gallican church, as Louis XIV. did. But I am not to be\r\nduped in that fashion. In my grasp I hold you; by a nod I make you flit\r\nfrom north to south, from east to west, like so many puppets. And now,\r\nwhen it suits me to make-believe that I count you for something, merely\r\nbecause you represent an antiquated idea which I wish to revive, you\r\nhave not the wit to see my drift, or affect not to perceive it. Seeing,\r\nthen, that I must speak out my whole mind, and put the matter just under\r\nyour nose, in order that you may see it--more particularly as you seem\r\nto think yourself indispensable to me, and lift up your head in\r\nconsequence, as you drape yourself in your old dame's robe--I'll have\r\nyou to know that such airs do not in the least impose on me; and if you\r\npersist in that course, I'll deal with your robe as Charles XII. did\r\nwith that of the grand vizier--I'll rend it for you with a dash of my\r\nspur!\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased. Throughout this tirade Pius maintained the same immobility of\r\nattitude, the same calm on his visage. At its close, however, he just\r\nlooked up, smiled with something of bitterness, and sighed as he slowly\r\narticulated the word, \"_Tra-je-di-an-te!_\"\r\n\r\nBonaparte at that moment was at the further end of the room, leaning on\r\nthe chimney-piece. Suddenly starting at the word, and turning round, his\r\nwhole person seemed to dilate, and his features to expand as passion\r\nrose within him. His look became fixed, and his eyes flared; then with\r\nthe swiftness of an arrow he rushed toward the old man, as if with some\r\nfell purpose. But he stopped short, snatched from the table a porcelain\r\nvase, dashed it to pieces against the andirons, and stamped on its\r\nfragments as they flew along the floor! Then pausing for an instant, as\r\nif to catch breath, he flung himself on a seat in utter exhaustion. It\r\nwould be difficult to say which was the more awful--his sudden outburst\r\nof rage, or his immobility and silence after it.\r\n\r\nIn some minutes the storm seemed gradually to subside, and a calm to\r\nsucceed. His look and bearing changed; something of depression seemed to\r\nsteal over him; his voice became deep and melancholy, and the first\r\nsyllables which he uttered showed this Proteus recalled to himself, and\r\ntamed by two words. \"Hapless existence!\" he exclaimed; then pausing,\r\nseemed to muse, and after a while continued, \"'tis but too true;\r\ncomedian or tragedian, all for me is an affair of acting and costume; so\r\nit has been hitherto, and such it is likely to continue. How fatiguing\r\nand how petty it is to pose--always to pose, in profile for this party,\r\nin full face for that, according to their notions! To guess at the\r\nimaginings of drivelers, and seem to be what they think one ought to be.\r\nTo study how to place them between hope and fear--dazzle them with the\r\nprestige of names and distances, of dates and bulletins--be the master\r\nof all, and not know what to do with them; and after all this to be as\r\nweary as I am--'tis too bad! The moment I sit down\"--he crossed his\r\nlegs, and leaned back in his chair--\"ennui seizes me. To be obliged to\r\nhunt for three days in yonder forest would throw me into a mortal\r\nlanguor. Activity is to me a necessity; I must keep moving myself, and\r\nmake others move, but I'll be hanged if I know whither. You see, then, I\r\ndisclose my inmost thoughts to you. Plans I have, enough and to spare,\r\nfor the lives of a score of emperors. I make one every morning, and\r\nanother every evening; my imagination wearies not; but before some three\r\nor four of my plans could be carried out, I should be used up body and\r\nmind: our little lamp of life burns not long before it begins to\r\nflicker. And now, to speak with entire frankness, am I sure that the\r\nworld would be happier even if all my plans were put in execution? It\r\nwould certainly be a somewhat finer thing than it is, for a magnificent\r\nuniformity would reign throughout it. I am not a philosopher; and in the\r\naffair of common sense, I am bound to own that the Florentine secretary\r\nwas a master to us all. I am no proficient in theories: with me\r\nreflection precedes decision, and execution instantly follows: the\r\nshortness of life forbids us to stand still. When I shall have passed\r\naway, there will be comments enough on my actions to exalt me if I\r\nsucceed, to disparage me if I fail. Paradoxes are already rife--they are\r\nnever wanting in France--but I shall still them to silence while I live;\r\nand when I am gone--no matter. My object is to succeed; for that I have\r\nsome capacity. My Iliad I compose in action; every day adds an\r\nepisode.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke these latter words he rose from his seat with a light\r\nelastic movement, and seemed altogether another person. When relieved\r\nfrom the turmoil of passion, he became gay, cheerful, and at the same\r\ntime unaffected and natural. He made no effort to pose, nor did he seek\r\nto exalt and idealize himself, as he did afterward in the conversations\r\nat St. Helena, to meet some philosophic conception, or to fill up the\r\nportrait of himself which he desired to bequeath to posterity. He was\r\nfar from any thing of this sort: in simple reality, he was himself, as\r\nit were, turned inside out. After a slight pause he advanced a step or\r\ntwo toward the Pope, who had not moved, and smiling, with an expression\r\nhalf-serious, half-ironical, proceeded in a new vein, in which were\r\nblended something of the elevated and the petty, of the pompous and the\r\ntrivial, as was often his usage--all the time speaking with the\r\nvolubility so often exhibited by this most versatile genius.\r\n\r\n\"Birth is every thing: those who appear on this world's stage poor and\r\nfriendless, have a desperate struggle to maintain. According to the\r\nquality of their minds they turn to action or to self-destruction. When\r\nthey have resolution to set to work, as I have done, they often play the\r\nwinning game. A man must live; he must conquer a position, and make for\r\nhimself an abiding-place. I have made mine as a cannon-ball does; so\r\nmuch the worse for those who stood in my way. Some are content with\r\nlittle, others never have enough: men eat according to their appetites,\r\nand I have a large one. Mark me, when I was at Toulon, I had not the\r\nprice of a pair of epaulets; but instead of them I had on my shoulders\r\nmy mother, and I know not how many brothers. All these are now tolerably\r\nwell provided for; and as to Josephine, who, it was said, married me\r\nfrom pity, we are about to crown her in the very teeth of Raguedeau, her\r\nnotary, who once told her that I had lost my commission and my sword,\r\nand was not worth a ducat; and faith he was not far wrong! But now, what\r\nis it that rises up in perspective before me? An imperial mantle and a\r\ncrown. To me what are such things? a costume, a mere actor's costume. I\r\nshall wear them for the occasion, that's enough: then resuming my\r\nmilitary frock, I'll get on horseback. On horseback said I?--yes, and\r\nperhaps for life; but scarcely shall I have taken up my new position\r\nwhen I shall run the risk of being pushed off my pedestal. Is that a\r\nstate to be envied? There are but two classes of men--those who have\r\nsomething, and those who have nothing. The first take their rest, the\r\nothers remain awake. As I perceived this when starting in the race of\r\nlife, I have reached the goal thus early. I know of but two men who\r\nattained it after having set out at the age of forty, and they were\r\nCromwell and Rousseau. Had the one had but a farm, and the other a few\r\nhundred francs and a domestic, they would neither have commanded,\r\npreached, nor written. There are various sorts of artists--in building,\r\nin forms, in colors, in phrases. I am an artist in battles; I had\r\nexecuted eighteen of what are called victories before the age of\r\nthirty-five. I have a right to be paid for my work, and if paid with a\r\nthrone, it can not be called dear. But, after all, a throne, what is it?\r\nTwo or three boards fashioned in this form or in that, and nailed\r\ntogether, with a strip of red velvet to cover them. By itself it is\r\nnothing; 'tis the man who sits upon it that makes its force. Still,\r\nthrone or no throne, I shall follow my vocation: you shall see some more\r\nof my doings. You shall see all dynasties date from mine, 'parvenu'\r\nthough I be; and elected, yes, elected like yourself, and chosen from\r\nthe crowd. On that point, at all events, we may shake hands.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he advanced and held out his hand. The Pope did not decline\r\nthe courtesy; but there was an evident constraint in his manner as he\r\nalmost tremblingly reached to him the tips of his fingers. He seemed\r\nunder the influence of a complex tide of emotion. He was moved somewhat,\r\nperhaps, by the tone of _bonhomie_ that pervaded the latter remarks, and\r\nby the frankness of the advance which concluded them; but the dominant\r\nfeeling was evidently of a sombre cast, arising from a reflection on his\r\nown position, and still more on that of so many Christian communities\r\nabandoned to the caprices of selfishness and hazard.\r\n\r\nThese movements of the inner man did not escape the scrutinizing glance\r\nof Bonaparte; a light and shadow passed rapidly across his face. He had\r\ncarried one point--the coronation was tacitly conceded; the rest may be\r\nleft to time. It was evident that, though not entirely without alloy,\r\nthe feeling of satisfaction was uppermost as he strode from the room\r\nwith all the _brusquerie_ with which he had entered it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Fraser's Magazine.]\r\n\r\nGABRIELLE; OR, THE SISTERS.\r\n\r\n    Those who weep not here, shall weep eternally hereafter.\r\n\r\n                            _Ecclesiæ Græcæ Monumenta._\r\n\r\n\r\nDim voices haunt me from the past--for the dream of life is dreamed, and\r\nmay now be revealed; the dreamer is loitering on the Bier Path leading\r\nto the green grass mounds, whence mouldering hands seem to point upward\r\nand say, \"Look thy last on the blue skies, and come rest with us.\"\r\n\r\nI have no happy childhood to recall; for I began to think so early, that\r\npain and thought are linked together. I had a father, and a sister two\r\nyears my senior; and our home was a small cottage, surrounded by a\r\nflower-garden, on the outskirts of a town, where the chime of\r\nchurch-bells was distinctly heard. These are sweet, romantic\r\nassociations; but \"garden flowers,\" and \"silvery chimes,\" and\r\n\"childhood's home,\" are words which awaken no answering chord in my\r\nheart--for Reality was stern, and Fancy wove no fabric of fairy texture\r\nwherewith to cover the naked truth.\r\n\r\nMy mother died when I was born; and my father was a thin, pale man,\r\nalways wrapped in flannels about the head and throat, and moving slowly\r\nwith the aid of a stick. He never breakfasted with us--we were kept in\r\nthe kitchen, to save firing--but he came down late in the forenoon, and\r\nwhen it was warm and sunshiny he would take a gentle stroll into the\r\nfields, never townward. We dined at a late hour, and there were always\r\ndelicacies for my father; and after dinner he sat over his wine, smoking\r\ncigars and reading the newspapers, till it was time to go to bed. He\r\ntook little notice of Gabrielle or me, except to command silence, or to\r\nsend us for any thing he wanted. There were two parlors in the cottage,\r\none at each side of the door; the furniture was scanty and mean, and the\r\nparlor on the left-hand side never had a fire in it, for my father\r\nalways inhabited the other. It was bitter cold for Gabrielle and me in\r\nthis left-hand room during the winter, for we were often turned in there\r\nto amuse ourselves; our sole domestic--an ancient Irish servitor,\r\nretained by my father solely on account of her culinary\r\naccomplishments--never admitted us poor shivering girls into the kitchen\r\nwhen she was cooking, for, said Nelly,\r\n\r\n\"If I am teased or narvous I shall, maybe, spoil the dinner, and then\r\nour Lady save us from the masther's growl.\"\r\n\r\nNo one ever came near us--we seemed utterly neglected, and our very\r\nexistence unknown. The house was redolent with the fumes of tobacco, and\r\nthe garden where we played was a wilderness of weeds, among which roses\r\nbloomed in summer, and Gabrielle and I watched for their coming with\r\ndelight: those summer roses, on the great tangled bushes, were surely\r\nmore beautiful to us than to other and more fortunate children--we\r\ngathered and preserved each leaf as it fell, and never was fragrance so\r\ndelicious!\r\n\r\nNow it may naturally be supposed, that from ignorance our impressions\r\nwere not painful; but from the time when I first began to notice and\r\ncomprehend, I also began to bitterly feel our condition, and Gabrielle\r\nfelt it far more than I did. We knew that we were half-starved,\r\nhalf-clad, neglected, unloved creatures, and that our parent was a\r\npersonification of Selfishness. We saw other children prettily dressed,\r\nwalking past with their mothers or nurses--or trotting to school,\r\nhealthful and happy; and our hearts yearned to be like them--yearned for\r\na mother's kiss! Gabrielle was habitually silent and proud, though often\r\npassionate when we were at play together; but the outburst was soon\r\nover, and she hugged me again directly. I early learned to dislike all\r\nugly things from gazing on her--her beauty was of a kind to dazzle a\r\nchild--she was so brilliantly fair and colorless, with clustering golden\r\nhair falling to her waist, and large soft blue eyes, which always made\r\nme think of heaven and the angels; for, thanks to His mercy, I knew of\r\nthem when I was yet a child.\r\n\r\nOf course we were unacquainted with our father's history as we afterward\r\nheard it. He was of a decayed but noble family, and--alas! it is a\r\ncommonplace tale--he had ruined his fortunes and broken his wife's\r\nheart by gambling. Worse even than this, he was irretrievably disgraced\r\nand lost to society, having been detected as a cheat; and broken down in\r\nevery sense of the word, with a trifling annuity only to subsist on, he\r\nlived, as I remember him, pampered, luxurious, and utterly forgetful of\r\nall save Self. And, oh! God grant there be none--poor or rich, high or\r\nlow--who can repeat the sacred name of \"father\" as I do, without an\r\nemotion of tenderness, without the slightest gossamer thread of love or\r\nrespect twined around the memory to bind the parental benediction\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nNelly had followed our deceased mother from her native isle, for she too\r\nwas Irish, and clung to our father, ministering to his habits and\r\ntastes, a good deal, I believe, for our sakes, and to keep near us. She\r\nwas a coarse woman; and, unlike her race in general, exhibited but few\r\noutward demonstrations of attachment. When her work was done in the\r\nevening she sometimes taught us the alphabet and to spell words of three\r\nletters; the rest we mastered for ourselves, and taught each other, and\r\nso in process of time we were able to read. The like with writing: Nelly\r\npointed out the rudiments, and Gabrielle, endowed with magical powers of\r\nswift perception, speedily wrought out lessons both for herself and me.\r\nThe only books in the house were a cookery-book; a spelling-book which\r\nNelly borrowed; a great huge History of England, which formed her usual\r\nfootstool; and an ancient, equally large Bible, full of quaint pictures.\r\nWould that I had the latter blessed volume bound in gold now, and set\r\nwith diamonds! A new epoch opened in my life. I had already thought, now\r\nI understood; and the light divine dawned on my soul as Nelly, the\r\nhumble instrument of grace, in simple words explained all that was\r\nwanting: for our faith is very simple, notwithstanding the ineffable\r\nglories of Jesus and redemption. I dreamed by night of Jesus and of\r\nangels, and of shepherds watching their flocks \"all seated on the\r\nground;\" and I used to ask Nelly if she did not think an angel must be\r\njust like Gabrielle, with shining wings, certainly? But Nelly would say\r\nthat Miss Gabrielle was too proud for an angel, and never likely to\r\nbecome one unless she liked her Bible better; and it was too true that\r\nmy darling sister had not the same love for holy things that I had then.\r\nShe liked to read of Queen Bess and Bluff King Hal; but when we found\r\nour way to a church, and heard the chanting, her emotions far surpassed\r\nmine, and she sobbed outright. At length Gabrielle, who had been\r\npondering many days without speaking, confided to me her determination\r\nto ask our father to send us to school.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I not ask him, Ruth?\" she said. \"I wonder we never thought\r\nof it before--only he is always poorly, or smoking, or drinking.\"\r\n\r\nI observed her beautiful lip curl as she spoke in a contemptuous tone,\r\nand I thought that Jesus taught _not so_; but I feared to speak--so I\r\nwept, and knelt down alone and prayed for my sister.\r\n\r\nGabrielle did ask him, and my father laid down his paper, and took the\r\ncigar from his mouth, gazing in dull amazement at the speaker, but I saw\r\nhis gaze become more earnest and observant as he said,\r\n\r\n\"Why, girl, how old are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thirteen last month,\" replied Gabrielle.\r\n\r\n\"You are a monstrous tall girl of your age, then, I declare: and you\r\nhave learned to read from Nelly, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we have,\" was the quiet reply; \"but we wish to learn something\r\nmore than that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must go to some charity school, miss, for I have no money to\r\npay for such nonsense; you can read, and write, and sew, and what more\r\nwould you have? Pass the claret nearer, and reach me those cigars; and\r\ntake yourselves off, for my head is splitting.\"\r\n\r\nI must draw a vail over Gabrielle's passion when we were alone.\r\n\r\n\"It is not for myself only that I sorrow,\" she exclaimed, as her sobs\r\nsubsided; \"but you, poor, little, delicate thing, with your lameness,\r\nwhat is to become of you in the big world if you are left alone? You can\r\nnot be a servant; and what are we to do without education? for Nelly has\r\ntold me our father's income dies with him.\"\r\n\r\nHer expressions were incoherent; and when I tried to comfort her, by\r\nassurances that the blessed Saviour cared for the fatherless, she turned\r\naway and left me. So ended the first and last application to our parent.\r\n\r\nWhen I remember Gabrielle's career from that period to her sixteenth\r\nyear I much marvel at the precocity of intellect she exhibited, and the\r\npowers of mind with which she was endowed. We had no money to procure\r\nbooks--no means to purchase even the common necessaries of clothing,\r\nwhich too often made us ashamed to appear in church. But suddenly\r\nGabrielle seemed to become a woman, and I her trusting child. She was\r\nsilent and cold; but not sullen or cold to me, though her mouth became\r\ncompressed as if from bitter thought, and never lost that expression\r\nagain, save when she smiled. Oh, that sunny smile of radiant beauty! I\r\nsee it now--I see it now! I tried to win her, by coaxing and fondling,\r\nto read the Holy Book; but Gabrielle said we were outcasts, and deserted\r\nby God. When I heard that my wan cheeks burned with indignation, and I\r\nexclaimed, \"You are wicked to say so;\" but Gabrielle was not angry, for\r\ntears stood in her eyes as she fixed them on me, whispering,\r\n\r\n\"Poor little cripple--sweet, gentle, loving sister--the angels that\r\nwhisper these good things to you pass me over. I hear them not, Ruth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sister, sister, they speak and you will not hear: do you think the\r\nstupid, lame Ruth is favored beyond the clever, the beautiful, the noble\r\nGabrielle?\"\r\n\r\nThen with an outburst of passionate love she would take me in her arms,\r\nand weep long and bitterly. I knew that I could not enter into the\r\ndepths of her feelings, but I comprehended her haughty bearing and\r\nscornful glances; for the neighbors looked at us pitifully, and\r\nGabrielle writhed beneath it: child as she was, there was something\r\nawful and grand in her lonely majesty of demeanor. Her self-denying,\r\nconstant devotion toward me--often ailing and pining as I was--I repaid\r\nby an affection which I am sure is quite different from that entertained\r\nby sisters happily placed for each other: Gabrielle was as mother and\r\nsister, and friend and nurse, and playmate, all in one to me. She and\r\nthe bright young roses in our neglected garden, were the only two\r\nbeautiful creations I had ever seen. It was well for me, in my childish\r\nsimplicity, that I knew not the wreck of mind--the waste of brilliant\r\npowers for want of cultivation--of which Gabrielle was the victim; but\r\nshe knew it, brooded over it, and the festering poison of hatred and\r\ncontempt changed her innocent, affectionate nature, toward all created\r\nthings, except her own and only sister.\r\n\r\nWe never wearied of listening to Nelly's accounts of the former grandeur\r\nof our maternal ancestors, intermixed with wild legends of chivalrous\r\nlove and gallant daring. She told us, too, of our ancient blood on the\r\nfather's side, and that we were the great-grandchildren of a belted\r\nearl. Gabrielle's pale cheeks flushed not--her eyes were downcast; but I\r\nknew the sufferings of the proud, beautiful girl. I too, humble as I\r\nwas, felt what we were--what we ought to have been, and the blood of the\r\nDe Courcys and O'Briens mounted to my throbbing temples.\r\n\r\nGabrielle was a lady--a lady in each action, word, and look; poorly and\r\ninsufficiently clad, her tall, graceful form bore the unmistakable mark\r\nof hereditary breeding, which neither poverty nor neglect could\r\neradicate. It was not her exceeding loveliness which alone attracted\r\nobservation, but it was a refinement and elegance which no education can\r\nbestow--it was Nature's stamp on one of her most peerless and exquisite\r\nproductions. One evening, when we had been listening to Nelly's\r\ndiscourse by the kitchen fire, a sudden and a new thought took hold of\r\nmy imagination, nor could I rest until I had imparted it to Gabrielle.\r\nIt was this--that she might marry some great, rich man, and so release\r\nus from want and privation; for, of course, my home would always be with\r\nher!\r\n\r\nGabrielle looked gravely on my upturned face an I knelt beside her, and\r\nconfided this \"new plan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ruth,\" she said, \"you are a wise and a singular child, and you deserve\r\nto be trusted. I mean to become a rich man's wife if I have the\r\nopportunity; but how it is to be brought about, your good book, perhaps,\r\nmay tell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, darling,\" I cried, \"do not smile so scornfully when you speak of\r\nthat blessed, dear book; it would comfort and lead you, indeed it\r\nwould, if you would but open and read its pages.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, Parson Ruth,\" she cried, laughing, \"that will do. When the\r\nrich man comes down from the clouds to make me his bride, I promise you\r\nI'll have a book bound in gold like that; and you shall be educated, my\r\ndarling Ruth, as the daughters of the De Courcys ought to be, and you\r\nshall forget that we have no father, no mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Forget our father?\" said I. \"Never, never!\"\r\n\r\nGabrielle was terribly shaken and agitated: little more than a child in\r\nyears, injustice and sorrow had taught her the emotions of age, yet she\r\nwas a guileless child in the world's ways, as events soon proved.\r\n\r\nWe used to ramble out into the adjacent meadows, and doubtless our\r\nroamings would have extended far and wide, had not my lameness precluded\r\nmuch walking, and Gabrielle never had a thought of leaving me. So we\r\nwere contented to saunter by a shining stream that meandered amid the\r\nrich pasture-land near our home; this stream was frequented by those\r\nfortunate anglers only who obtained permission from the lady of the\r\nmanor to fish in it, and this permit was not lavishly bestowed,\r\nconsequently our favorite haunt was usually a solitary one. But soon\r\nafter Gabrielle had completed her sixteenth year we noted a sickly\r\nyouth, who patiently pursued his quiet sport by the hour together, and\r\nnever looked round as we passed and repassed him. Some trifling \"chance\"\r\n(as it is called) led to his thanking Gabrielle for assisting to\r\ndisentangle his line, which had caught amid the willow-branches\r\noverhanging the water; the same \"chance\" caused him to observe his\r\nbeautiful assistant, and I saw his start of surprise and admiration. He\r\nwas a silly-looking lad, we thought, dressed like a gentleman, and\r\nbehaving as one; and he was never absent now from the meadows when we\r\nwere there. He always bowed, and often addressed some passing\r\nobservation to us, but timidly and respectfully, for Gabrielle was a\r\ngirl to command both homage and respect. She pitied the lonely, pale\r\nyoung man, who seemed so pleased to find any one to speak to, and\r\nexhibited such extraordinary patience and perseverance, for he never\r\ncaught a fish that we saw. Through the medium of a gossip of Nelly, who\r\nwas kitchen-maid at the principal inn, we ascertained that our new\r\nacquaintance was staying there for his health's benefit, and for the\r\npurpose of angling; that his name was Erminstoun, only son of the rich\r\nMr. Erminstoun, banker, of T----. Nelly's gossip had a sister who lived\r\nat Erminstoun Hall, so there was no doubt about the correctness of the\r\ninformation, both as regarded Mr. Thomas Erminstoun's identity, and the\r\nenormous wealth of which it was said his father was possessed. The\r\ninformant added, that poor Mr. Thomas was a _leetle_ soft maybe, but the\r\nidol of his parent; and that he squandered \"money like nothing,\" \"being\r\na generous, open-handed, good young gentleman.\"\r\n\r\nI observed a great change in Gabrielle's manner, after hearing this,\r\ntoward her admirer--for so he must be termed--as admiration was so\r\nevident in each word and look: by-and-by Gabrielle went out alone--there\r\nwas no one to question or rebuke her; and in six weeks from the day that\r\nMr. Thomas Erminstoun first saw her she became his wife. Yes, startling\r\nas it appears, it all seemed very natural and simple of accomplishment\r\nthen; early one brilliant summer morning, Gabrielle woke me, and bade me\r\nrise directly, as she wished to confide something of great importance,\r\nwhich was about to take place in a few hours. Pale, but composed, she\r\nproceeded to array herself and me in plain white robes, and straw\r\nbonnets; new and purely white, yet perfectly simple and inexpensive,\r\nthough far better than the habiliments we had been accustomed to wear.\r\nGabrielle took them from a box, which must have come when I was\r\nsleeping; and when our toilet was completed, I compared her in my own\r\nmind to one of those young maidens whom I had seen in the church, when\r\nbands of fair creatures were assembled for confirmation. She looked not\r\nlike _a bride_--there was no blushing, no trembling; but a calm\r\nself-possession, and determination of purpose, which awed me.\r\n\r\n\"My wise little sister Ruth,\" she said, \"I am going to be married this\r\nmorning to Mr. Thomas Erminstoun, at ---- church. You are my bridemaid,\r\nand the clerk gives me away. I shall not come back here any more, for a\r\nchaise and four waits in Yarrow Wood to convey us away directly after\r\nour marriage. You will come home, darling, and take off your marriage\r\napparel to appear before _him_; and as I do not often dine with him, and\r\nhe never asks for me, I shall not be missed. So say nothing--Nelly's\r\ntongue is tied--fear not her. Be patient, beloved one, till you hear\r\nfrom me: bright days are coming, Ruth, and we do not part for long.\"\r\n\r\nHere she wept, oh, so bitterly, I thought she would die. Amazed and\r\ntrembling, I ventured to ask if she loved Mr. Thomas Erminstoun better\r\nthan me, for jealousy rankled, and at fourteen I knew nothing of _love_.\r\n\r\n\"Love _him_!\" she cried vehemently, clasping her hands wildly; \"I love\r\nonly you on earth, my Ruth, my sister. He is a fool; and I marry him to\r\nsave you and myself from degradation and misery. He buys me with his\r\nwealth. I am little more than sixteen\"--she hung down her lovely head,\r\npoor thing--\"but I am old in sorrow; I am hardened in sin, for I am\r\nabout to commit a great sin. I vow to love, where I despise; to obey,\r\nwhen I mean to rule; and to honor, when I hold the imbecile youth in\r\nutter contempt!\"\r\n\r\nVain were supplications and prayers to wait. Gabrielle led me away to\r\nthe meadows, where a fly was in waiting, which conveyed us to the\r\nchurch. I saw her married; I signed something in a great book; I felt\r\nher warm tears and embraces, and I knew that Mr. Thomas Erminstoun\r\nkissed me too, as he disappeared with Gabrielle, and the clerk placed me\r\nin the fly alone, which put me down in the same place, in the quiet\r\nmeadows by the shining water. I sat down and wept till I became\r\nexhausted. Was this all a dream? Had Gabrielle really gone? My\r\nchild-sister married? Become rich and great? But I treasured her words,\r\nhurried home, and put on my old dark dress; and Nelly said not a word.\r\nMr. Thomas Erminstoun's gold had secured her silence; and she was to\r\n\"know nothing,\" but to take care of me for the present.\r\n\r\nEre my father retired to rest that night, a letter was brought addressed\r\nto him. I never knew the contents, but it was from Gabrielle and\r\nGabrielle's husband. I did not see him again for some days, and then he\r\nnever looked at me; and strange, strange it seemed, Gabrielle had\r\ndisappeared like a snow wreath, in silence, in mystery; and I exclaimed\r\nin agony, \"Was there ever any thing like this in the world before?\"\r\n\r\nMy father made himself acquainted with the position of the young man\r\nwhom his daughter had gone off with, and also of the legality of their\r\nmarriage; that ascertained satisfactorily, he sank into the same\r\nhopeless slothfulness and indolence as heretofore, dozing life away, and\r\nconsidering he had achieved a prodigious labor in making the necessary\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nVery soon after this I had my first letter--doubly dear and interesting\r\nbecause it was from Gabrielle. The inn servant brought it under pretext\r\nof visiting Nelly, so my father knew nothing about it. Ah, that first\r\nletter! shall I ever forget how I bathed it my with tears, and covered\r\nit with kisses? It was short, and merely said they were in lodgings for\r\nthe present, because Mr. Erminstoun had not yet forgiven his son: not a\r\nword about her happiness; not a word of her husband; but she concluded\r\nby saying, \"that very soon she hoped to send for her darling Ruth--never\r\nto be parted more.\"\r\n\r\nI know that my guardian angel whispered the thoughts that now came into\r\nmy head as I read and pondered; because I had prayed to be led as a\r\nsheep by the shepherd, being but a simple, weakly child. I determined on\r\ntwo things--to show the letter I had received from Gabrielle to my\r\nfather, for conscience loudly whispered concealment was wrong; and never\r\nto quit him, because the time might come when he, perhaps, would\r\nrequire, or be glad of my attendance. I felt quite happy after forming\r\nthese resolutions on my knees; and I wrote to Gabrielle telling her of\r\nthem. I know not if my father observed what I said, but he took no\r\nnotice, for he was half asleep and smoking; so I left the letter beside\r\nhim, as I ever did afterward, for I often heard from my beloved sister:\r\nand oh! but it _was_ hard to resist her entreaties that I would come to\r\nher--that it was for my sake as well as her own she had taken so bold a\r\nstep; and that now she had a pleasant home for me, and I refused. It was\r\nhard to refuse; but God was with me, or I never could have had strength\r\nof myself to persevere in duty, and \"_deny myself_.\" When Gabrielle\r\nfound arguments and entreaties vain, she gave way to bursts of anguish\r\nthat nearly overcame me; but when \"I was weak, then I was strong,\" and I\r\nclasped my precious Bible, and told her I _dared_ not leave my father.\r\n\r\nThen came presents of books, and all kinds of beautiful and useful\r\nthings, to add to my comfort or improvement. Gabrielle told me they were\r\nsettled in a pretty cottage near the Hall, and that Mr. Erminstoun had\r\nforgiven his son. Mr. Erminstoun was a widower, and had five daughters\r\nby a former marriage--Gabrielle's husband being the only child of his\r\nsecond union: the Misses Erminstoun were all flourishing in single\r\nblessedness, and were known throughout the country-side as the \"proud\r\nMiss Erminstouns.\" These ladies were tall, and what some folks call\r\n\"dashing women;\" wearing high feathers, bright colors, and riding hither\r\nand thither in showy equipages, or going to church on the Sabbath with a\r\nfootman following their solemn and majestic approach to the house of\r\nprayer, carrying the richly-emblazoned books of these \"miserable\r\nsinners.\"\r\n\r\nHow I pined to hear from Gabrielle that she was happy, and cherished by\r\nher new connections; that she was humbled also, in some measure--abashed\r\nat the bold step she had taken. So young--so fair--so determined. I\r\ntrembled, girl as I was, when I thought that God's wrath might fall on\r\nher dear head, and chasten her rebellious spirit.\r\n\r\nSix months subsequent to Gabrielle's departure our father died, after\r\nbut a few days' severe suffering. Dying, he took my hand and murmured,\r\n\"Good child!\" and those precious words fell as a blessing on my soul;\r\nand I know he listened to the prayers which God put into my heart to\r\nmake for his departing spirit. I mourned for the dead, because he was my\r\nfather and I his child....\r\n\r\nNelly accompanied me to my sister's home; and fairyland seemed opening\r\nto my view when I embraced Gabrielle once more. What a pleasant home it\r\nwas!--a cottage not much larger than the one I had left--but how\r\ndifferent! Elegance and comfort were combined; and when I saw the rare\r\nexotics in the tasteful conservatory I remembered the roses in our\r\nwilderness. Ah, I doubt if we ever valued flowers as we did those\r\nprecious dewy buds. Wood End Cottage stood on the brow of a hill,\r\ncommanding a fair prospect of sylvan quietude; the old Parsonage was\r\nadjacent, inhabited by a bachelor curate, \"poor and pious,\" the church\r\ntower peeping forth from a clump of trees. The peal of soft bells in\r\nthat mouldering tower seemed to me like unearthly music: my heart\r\nthrilled as I heard their singular, melancholy chime. There were fine\r\nmonuments within the church, and it had a superb painted window, on\r\nwhich the sun always cast its last gleams during the hours of\r\nsummer-evening service.\r\n\r\nMy brother-in-law, Mr. Thomas Erminstoun, was paler and thinner than\r\nwhen I had seen him last, and I was shocked and alarmed at his\r\nappearance. His love for Gabrielle amounted to idolatry; and for her\r\nsake he loved and cherished me. She was colder and haughtier in manner\r\nthan ever, receiving passively all the devoted tenderness lavished by\r\nher husband: this pained me sadly; for though he was assuredly simple,\r\nthere was an earnest truthfulness and kindliness about him, which won on\r\nthe affections amazingly. He would speak to me of Gabrielle by the hour\r\ntogether, with ever-increasing delight; we both marveled at her\r\nsurpassing beauty, which each week became more angelic and pure in\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nOn me alone all my sister's caresses were bestowed; all the pent-up love\r\nof a passionate nature found vent in my arms, which were twined around\r\nher with strange enthusiastic love; therefore it was, her faults\r\noccasioned me such agony--for I could not but see them--and I alone, of\r\nall the world, knew her noble nature--knew what she \"might have been.\" I\r\ntold her that I expected to have found her cheerful, now she had a happy\r\nhome of her own.\r\n\r\n\"Happy! cheerful!\" she cried, sadly. \"A childhood such as mine was,\r\nflings dark shadows over all futurity, Ruth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, speak not so, beloved,\" I replied; \"have you not a good husband,\r\nyour error mercifully forgiven? are you not surrounded by blessings?\"\r\n\r\n\"And dependent,\" she answered, bitterly\r\n\r\n\"But dependent on your husband, as the Bible says every woman should\r\nbe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And my husband is utterly dependent on his father, Ruth; he has neither\r\nability nor health to help himself, and on his father he depends for our\r\nbread. I have but exchanged one bondage for another; and all my hope is\r\nnow centred in you, dearest, to educate you--to render you independent\r\nof this cold, hard world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Gabrielle,\" I said, \"you are not seventeen yet--it is not too\r\nlate, is it, for you also to be educated?\"\r\n\r\n\"Too late, too late,\" answered Gabrielle, mournfully. \"Listen, wise\r\nRuth, I shall be a mother soon; and to my child, if it is spared, and to\r\nyou, I devote myself. You have seen the Misses Erminstoun--you have seen\r\nvulgarity, insolence, and absurd pretension; they have taunted me with\r\nmy ignorance, and I will not change it now. The blood of the De Courcys\r\nand O'Briens has made me a lady; and all the wealth of the Indies can\r\nnot make them so. No, Ruth, I will remain in ignorance, and yet tower\r\nabove them, high as the clouds above the dull earth, in innate\r\nsuperiority and power of mind!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my sister,\" I urged timidly, \"it is not well to think highly of\r\none's self--the Bible teaches not so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ruth! Ruth!\" she exclaimed, impatiently, \"it is not that I think highly\r\nof myself, as you well know; you well know with what anguish I have\r\ndeplored our wants; it is pretension I despise, and rise above; talent,\r\nand learning, and virtue, and nobleness, that I revere, and could\r\nworship!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, beloved,\" I urged, \"people may be very kind and good, without\r\nbeing so mighty clever.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Erminstouns female are not kind, are not good,\" she haughtily\r\nreplied: \"the Erminstouns male are fools! Ruth, I have changed one\r\nbondage for another, and the sins of the father fall on the innocent\r\nchild. I have changed starvation, and cold, and degradation, for hateful\r\ndependence on the vulgar and despised. Woe is me, woe is me! If I can\r\nbut save you, my sister, and make you independent, I can bear my lot.\"\r\n\r\nMy education commenced, and they called me a \"wise child:\" every one was\r\nkind to the poor cripple, even the \"proud Miss Erminstouns,\" who cast\r\nenvious and disdainful glances on my beautiful sister, which she repaid\r\nwith unutterable scorn--silent, but sure. Oh, how I prayed Gabrielle to\r\n_try_ and win their love; to read her Bible, and therein find that \"a\r\nkind word turneth away wrath;\" but Gabrielle was proud as Lucifer, and\r\nliked not to read of humility and forbearance. I found a zealous friend\r\nand instructor in Mr. Dacre, the \"poor, pious curate;\" he was a college\r\nfriend of my brother-in-law, and a few years his senior. I felt assured\r\nthat Mr. Dacre thought Mr. Thomas's life a very precarious one, from the\r\nway in which he spoke to him on religious subjects, and the anxiety he\r\nevinced as to his spiritual welfare. Mr. Dacre used also to call me his\r\n\"wise little friend;\" and we were wont to speak of passages in the book\r\nI loved best. What thought I of him? Why, sometimes in my own mind I\r\nwould compare him to an apostle--St. Paul, for instance, sincere,\r\nlearned, and inspired; but then St. Paul haunted my day-dreams as a\r\nreverend gentleman with a beard and flowing robes, while Mr. Dacre was\r\nyoung, handsome, and excessively neat in his ecclesiastical costume and\r\nappointments generally. Mr. Dacre had serious dark eyes--solemn eyes\r\nthey were, in my estimation, but the very sweetest smile in the world;\r\nand one of the Misses Erminstoun seemed to think so too: but people said\r\nthat the pious young minister was vowed to celibacy.\r\n\r\nThere was also another frequent visitor at Erminstoun Hall, who not\r\nseldom found his way to Wood End Cottage; and this was no less a\r\npersonage than Lord Treherne, who resided at Treherne Abbey in princely\r\nmagnificence, and had lately become a widower. This nobleman was upward\r\nof sixty, stately, cold, and reserved in manner, and rarely warmed into\r\na smile, except in contemplation of woman's beauty; of which, indeed, he\r\nwas an enthusiastic admirer. The late Lady Treherne had presented her\r\nlord with no family; and the disappointment was bitterly felt by Lord\r\nTreherne, who most ardently desired an heir to succeed to his ancient\r\ntitle and immense possessions. It was rumored abroad that the eldest\r\nMiss Erminstoun was likely to become the favored lady on whom his\r\nlordship's second choice might fall: she was still a handsome woman, and\r\nas cold and haughty as Lord Treherne himself; but, notwithstanding her\r\nsmiles and encouragement, the ancient cavalier in search of a bride did\r\nnot propose. Nay, on the contrary, he evinced considerable interest in\r\nMr. Thomas Erminstoun's failing health; he was the poor young\r\ngentleman's godfather, and it seemed not improbable that, in the event\r\nof his lordship dying childless, his godson might inherit a desirable\r\nfortune. Rare fruits and flowers arrived in profusion from the Abbey;\r\nand my lord showed great interest in my progress, while Gabrielle\r\ntreated him with far more freedom than she did any one else, and seemed\r\npleased and gratified by his fatherly attentions.\r\n\r\nAt length the time arrived when Gabrielle became the mother of as lovely\r\na babe as ever entered this world of woe; and it was a fair and touching\r\nsight to behold the young mother caressing her infant daughter. I have\r\noften wondered that I felt no pangs of jealousy, for the beauteous\r\nstranger more than divided my sister's love for me--she engaged it\r\nnearly all: and there was something fearful and sublime in the exceeding\r\nidolatry of Gabrielle for her sweet baby. Self was immolated altogether;\r\nand when she hung over the baby's couch each night, watching its happy,\r\npeaceful slumbers, it was difficult to say which of the twain was the\r\nmore beautiful. Repose marked the countenance of each--Gabrielle's was\r\nimbued with the heavenly repose of parental love.\r\n\r\nIn less than twelve months after its birth, that poor baby was\r\nfatherless. I had anticipated and foreseen this calamity; and Gabrielle\r\nconducted herself, as I believed she would, without hypocrisy, but with\r\nserious propriety. Sad scenes followed this solemn event; the Misses\r\nErminstoun wished to take her child from Gabrielle, to bring it up at\r\nthe Hall. Mr. Erminstoun urged her compliance, and recommended my sister\r\nto seek \"a situation\" for me, as \"he had already so expensive an\r\nestablishment to keep up; and now poor Thomas was gone, there was really\r\nno occasion for Wood End Cottage to be on his hands. Gabrielle must find\r\na home in some farm-house.\"\r\n\r\nAll this came about in a few months, from one thing to another; and the\r\nyoung widow, who had been ever hated as a wife, was grudged her daily\r\nsupport by her deceased husband's family. \"Give up her child?\" Gabrielle\r\nonly laughed when they spoke of that; but her laugh rings in my ears\r\nyet! though it was as soft and musical as the old church bells.\r\n\r\nWe left Wood End Cottage, and found refuge in a retired farm-house, as\r\nMr. Erminstoun proposed; but we were together: and there were many who\r\ncried \"shame\" on the rich banker, for thus casting off his\r\ndaughter-in-law and his grandchild. Small was the pittance he allowed\r\nfor our subsistence; and the Misses Erminstoun never noticed Gabrielle\r\non her refusal to part with the child. \"She was not fit,\" they bruited\r\nabout, \"to bring up their poor brother's daughter. She was ignorant,\r\nuneducated, and unamiable, besides being basely ungrateful for kindness\r\nlavished; she had a cold heart and repellant manner, which had steeled\r\ntheir sympathies toward her.\" They thought themselves ill-used at\r\nErminstoun Hall; and the five Misses Erminstoun regarded Gabrielle and\r\nher poor little daughter as mere interlopers, who were robbing them of\r\ntheir father's money.\r\n\r\nWell might Gabrielle say--\"I have changed one bondage for another!\" but\r\nI never heard her repeat that now. She was silent, even to me. No murmur\r\nescaped her lips; and what she felt or suffered I knew not. Little Ella\r\nwas a pale flower, like her mother; but as similar to the parent rose as\r\nan opening rosebud.\r\n\r\n\"What could I do?\" were the words I was continually repeating to myself.\r\n\"I must not be an added burden to Mr. Erminstoun. I have already\r\nprofited by my sister's union with his son, by having gratefully\r\nreceived instruction in various branches of learning, and can I not do\r\nsomething for myself?\" What this _something_ was to be, I could not\r\ndefine. My lameness precluded active employment, and I was too young to\r\nbecome a \"companion.\" I confided my thoughts and wishes to Mr. Dacre,\r\nwho often visited us, speaking words of balm and consolation to the\r\nafflicted. Gabrielle listened to his words, as she never had done to\r\nmine; and he could reprove, admonish, exhort, or cheer, when all human\r\nhope seemed deserting us. For where were we to look for a shelter,\r\nshould it please Mr. Erminstoun to withdraw his allowance, to force\r\nGabrielle to abandon her child to have it from want? I verily believe,\r\nhad it not been for that precious babe, she would have begged her bread,\r\nand suffered me to do so, rather than be dependent on the\r\nscantily-doled-out bounty of Mr. Erminstoun.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelve months that elapsed after her husband's death there\r\nwas a \"great calm\" over Gabrielle--a tranquillity, like that exhibited\r\nby an individual walking in sleep. I had expected despair and passion\r\nwhen her lofty spirit was thus trampled to the dust; but no, as I have\r\nsaid, she was strangely tranquil--strangely silent. There was no\r\nresignation--that is quite another thing; and, except when my sister\r\nlistened to Mr. Dacre, she never read her Bible, or suffered me to read\r\nit to her: but his deep, full, rich voice, inexpressibly touching and\r\nsweet in all its modulations, ever won her rapt, undivided attention.\r\nShe attended the church where he officiated; and though the Erminstouns\r\nhad a sumptuously-decorated pew there, it was not to that the young\r\nwidow resorted; she sat amid the poor in the aisle, beneath a\r\nmagnificent monument of the Treherne family, where the glorious sunset\r\nrays, streaming through the illuminated window, fell full upon her\r\nclustering golden hair and downcast eyes.\r\n\r\nThere was pride in this, not humility; and Gabrielle deceived herself,\r\nas, with a quiet grace peculiarly her own, she glided to her lowly seat,\r\nrejecting Lord Treherne's proffered accommodation, as he courteously\r\nstood with his pew door open, bowing to the fair creature as if she had\r\nbeen a queen. The five Misses Erminstoun knelt on their velvet cushions,\r\narrayed in feathers and finery, and strong in riches and worldly\r\nadvantages; but my pale sister, in her coarsely-fashioned mourning-garb,\r\nseated on a bench, and kneeling on the stone, might have been taken for\r\nthe regal lady, and they her plebeian attendants.\r\n\r\nSpiteful glances they cast toward Gabrielle, many a time and oft, when\r\nmy Lord Treherne so pointedly paid his respectful devoirs; and there was\r\nas much pride and haughtiness in Gabrielle's heart as in theirs. Poor\r\nthing! she said truly, that \"early shadows had darkened her soul,\" and\r\nwhat had she left but _pride_? Not an iota of woman's besetting\r\nlittleness had my sister--noble, generous, self-denying, devoted where\r\nshe loved; her sweetness had been poisoned, nor had she sought that\r\nfountain of living water which alone can purify such bitterness. Gentle\r\nin manner, pure in heart, affectionate in disposition, Gabrielle's pride\r\nwrought her misery. Lord Treherne never came in person to our humble\r\nhome--he had but once paid his respects to Gabrielle since her\r\nwidowhood; but the rarest exotics continued to decorate our poor room,\r\nconstantly replenished from Treherne Abbey, and sent, with his\r\nlordship's card, by a confidential domestic. He was always at church\r\nnow, and people remarked \"how pious my lord had latterly become.\" I was\r\nfar too young and inexperienced then to understand or appreciate this\r\ndelicacy and propriety on Lord Treherne's part. But Mr. Dacre understood\r\nit; nor would _he_ have intruded on our privacy, save in his ministerial\r\ncapacity, and for the purpose of aiding and assisting me in the studies\r\nI endeavored to pursue. There was a \"halo of sanctity\" around Mr. Dacre,\r\nwhich effectually precluded any approach to freedom or frivolous\r\nconversation, in any society wherein he might be placed. He gave the\r\ntone to that society, and the gay and dashing Misses Erminstoun became\r\nsubdued in his presence; while Lord Treherne, with excellent taste, not\r\nonly showed the outward respect due to Mr. Dacre's sacred and high\r\noffice, but the regard which his personal qualities deserved.\r\n\r\nI have often looked back on that time immediately after my\r\nbrother-in-law's decease, with wonder at our serenity--nay, almost\r\ncontentment and happiness; despite the anguish and humiliation I knew\r\nGabrielle must endure, her smile was ever beautiful and sweet, and\r\nillumined our poor home with the sunshine of heaven.\r\n\r\nOur baby was, I think I may say, almost equally dear to us both--it had\r\ntwo mothers, Gabrielle said; and what with nursing the darling little\r\nthing, and learning my lessons, and Mr. Dacre's visits, time flew\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nOn the appearance of each fresh token of Lord Treherne's remembrance, I\r\nobserved an expression flit across my sister's face which I could not\r\ndefine; it was of triumph and agony combined, and she always flew to her\r\nbaby, clasping it convulsively to her bosom, and whispering words of\r\nstrange import. On Mr. Dacre's expressive, serious countenance, also, I\r\nnoticed passing clouds, as Gabrielle bestowed enthusiastic admiration on\r\nthe superb exotics. Why this was I could by no means satisfactorily\r\ndecide, as Mr. Dacre, so kind and generous, must approve the\r\ndisinterested delicacy exhibited by Lord Treherne, in his offerings to\r\nthe fatherless and widow. But the disinterestedness of my lord's\r\nattentions was a myth which I soon discarded: for in twelve months\r\nsubsequent to Mr. Thomas Erminstoun's decease, a letter from Treherne\r\nAbbey was brought to Gabrielle, sealed with the armorial bearings of the\r\nTrehernes, and signed by the present representative of that noble race.\r\nWe were seated at our fireside, busy with domestic needlework, and I saw\r\nGabrielle's hands tremble as she opened it, while that strange, wild\r\nexpression of triumph and pain, flitted more than once over her face as\r\nshe perused the missive. She silently gave it to me, and with amazement\r\nI read its contents--such an idea had never once entered my simple\r\nbrain. Lord Treherne made Gabrielle an offer of his hand and heart,\r\nsignifying that if she would graciously incline her ear to his suit, a\r\nbrilliant destiny awaited her infant daughter--on whom, and on its\r\nlovely mother, the most munificent settlements should be made. I laughed\r\nheartily as I read his lordship's rhapsodies, becoming a young lover;\r\nand I said, returning the epistle to Gabrielle, \"What a pity, dearest,\r\nthat we can not have such a noble father for our little Ella!\" the\r\npossibility of Gabrielle's marrying a man of nearly seventy never\r\nentered into my calculations for a moment. Therefore my astonishment was\r\noverwhelming when she seriously answered,\r\n\r\n\"Why can not Lord Treherne be a father to my child, Ruth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, dearest, you could not marry him--he is so old.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I mean to marry him, Ruth: could you doubt it? Could I have lived\r\non as I have done without prophetic hope to support me? Think you, if\r\nLord Treherne were double the age, I would refuse rank, wealth and\r\npower? Oh, Ruth, were I alone, it might be different.\" She spoke in a\r\ntone of suppressed anguish and passionate regret. \"But look on her,\"\r\npointing to the sleeping cherub, \"for her sake I would _immolate myself\r\non any altar of sacrifice_. Her fate shall be a brighter one than her\r\nmother's--if that mother has power to save and to bless! _She_ must not\r\nbe doomed to poverty or dependence. No, no! I give her a father who can\r\nrestore in her the ancient glories of our race; for my Ella is a\r\ndescendant of the chivalrous O'Briens and the noble De Courcys.\"\r\n\r\n\"And of the Erminstouns of Erminstoun Hall,\" I gently suggested, for\r\nGabrielle was greatly excited.\r\n\r\n\"Name them not, Ruth; name them not, if you love me. To change their\r\nhated name, what would I not do?\"\r\n\r\nAlas! thought I, you are deceiving yourself, my poor sister, in this\r\nsupposed immolation on an altar of sacrifice; it is not for your child's\r\nsake alone, though you fancy so. But Blanche Erminstoun will be\r\ndisappointed, revenge obtained, and pride amply gratified, and truly\r\n\"the heart is deceitful above all things.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dacre entered the apartment as Gabrielle ceased speaking, for we had\r\nnot heard his modest signal, and he was unannounced. My sister colored\r\nto the very temples on seeing the young pastor, and her hands trembled\r\nin the vain endeavor to fold Lord Treherne's letter, which at length she\r\nimpatiently crushed together. I heard a half-smothered hysterical sob,\r\nas, with a faltering voice, she bade our guest \"Good-evening.\" Ah! when\r\nthe heart is aching and throbbing with agony, concealed and suppressed,\r\nit requires heroic self-command to descend to the commonplaces of this\r\nworkaday world; but women early learn to conceal and subdue their\r\nfeelings, when premature sorrows have divided them from real or\r\npretended sympathies.\r\n\r\nI read my sister's heart, I knew her secret, and I inwardly murmured,\r\n\"Alas for woman's love, it is cast aside!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy sister's marriage with Lord Treherne was a strictly private one\r\n(Gabrielle had stipulated for this), his lordship's chaplain performing\r\nthe ceremony. My thoughts reverted to Gabrielle's first marriage, when\r\nthe clerk gave her away, and she was clad in muslin; now she was arrayed\r\nin satin and glittering gems, and a peer of the realm, an old friend of\r\nthe bridegroom, gave her lily hand at the altar to her noble lover.\r\nTwice she was forsworn; but the desecration to her soul was not so great\r\non the first as on the present occasion, for then her heart was still\r\nher own; while now, alas for woman's love, it was cast aside!\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks after the marriage we all departed for the Continent,\r\nwhere we remained for the six following years, Gabrielle and myself\r\nreceiving instructions in every accomplishment suitable to our position.\r\nIt was charming to witness with what celerity my beautiful sister\r\nacquired every thing she undertook, for she was as anxious as her lord\r\nto adorn the high station to which she now belonged. Wherever we went\r\nthe fame of Lady Treherne's beauty went with us, while her fascination\r\nof manner and high-bred elegance perfectly satisfied her fastidious\r\nhusband that he had made a wise and prudent choice. There was one\r\ndrawback to his lordship's perfect contentment, and this was the absence\r\nof the much-wished-for heir, for Gabrielle presented no children to her\r\nhusband; and our little Ella, a fairy child, of brilliant gifts and\r\nalmost superhuman loveliness, became as necessary to Lord Treherne's\r\nhappiness as she was to her doting mother's. It was settled ere we\r\nreturned to England, that Ella was to drop the name of Erminstoun, and\r\nas Lord Treherne's acknowledged heiress, legal forms were to be\r\nimmediately adopted in order to ratify the change of name to that of the\r\nfamily appellation of the Trehernes.\r\n\r\nWith a murmur of grateful feeling I saw Gabrielle kneel beside her aged\r\nhusband, and thank him fondly for this proof of regard; triumph sparkled\r\nin her eyes, and Lord Treherne laid his hand on her fair head, blessing\r\nher as he did so. She had made him a good wife, in every sense of the\r\nterm: he had never forgot that her blood equaled his own. But Gabrielle\r\ndid, for that very reason; her gratitude made her humble toward him,\r\nbecause he was humble toward her: nor did Lord Treherne ever cease to\r\nthink that Gabrielle had conferred a favor in marrying him.\r\n\r\nA succession of _fêtes_ and entertainments were given at Treherne Abbey\r\nafter our return, and Gabrielle was the star on whom all gazed with\r\ndelighted admiration. All the country families flocked to pay their\r\nhomage, but the Erminstouns came not until Lady Treherne extended a hand\r\nof welcome to her first husband's family; she was too exalted, both in\r\nstation and mind, to cherish the pitiful remembrances of their former\r\nunkindness. There were but two Misses Erminstoun now, the others were\r\nwell married (according to the world's notion, that is); and the\r\nyoungest, who had not given up hopes of yet becoming Mrs. Dacre, had\r\ntransformed herself into a nun-like damsel, something between a Sister\r\nof Charity and a Quakeress in exterior: perhaps Mr. Dacre read the\r\ninterior too well; and, notwithstanding the lady's assiduous visits to\r\nthe poor, and attendance on the charity-schools, and regular loud\r\ndevotions at church, Mr. Dacre remained obdurate and wedded to celibacy.\r\nIt might be that he disapproved of the marriage of the clergy, but I\r\nthink he was at one time vulnerable on that point.\r\n\r\nHow delighted I was to see him once more, to hear him call me his \"wise\r\nlittle friend,\" with his former sweet smile and affectionate manner; six\r\nyears had changed him--he looked rather careworn, and well he might, for\r\nhe was a true worker in the Lord's vineyard: nor was his mission\r\nconfined to the poor; the rich and noble also felt his influence. Lord\r\nand Lady Treherne greeted him as an old and valued friend; nor could I\r\ndetect the slightest agitation in Gabrielle's manner, and my former\r\nsuspicions almost faded away. She brought our fair Ella to welcome \"papa\r\nand mamma's friend\" to Treherne; and Ella, with her winning, gentle\r\nways, soon made Mr. Dacre understand that she loved him very much\r\nindeed: she was a holy child, and the principal joy of her innocent life\r\nwas to hear me tell her those stories in which I used to take delight in\r\nmy early days--how contrasted to hers! She would sing her pretty hymns,\r\nseated on a low footstool at Lord Treherne's feet; and the stately\r\nnobleman, with tears in his eyes, used to exclaim with pathos,\r\n\r\n\"Sister Ruth, sister Ruth, my heart misgives me; the angels surely will\r\ntake this child to themselves, and leave us desolate.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Dacre came not frequently to Treherne, but he was a quick observer,\r\nand he saw we had set up an idol for ourselves in this child, he\r\ncautioned us, but Gabrielle shivered--yes, _shivered_ with dismay, at\r\nthe bare suggestion he hinted at--that God was a \"jealous God,\" and\r\npermitted no idolatrous worship to pass unreproved.\r\n\r\nPoor young mother, how can I relate the scenes I lived to witness!\r\n\r\nElla died, aged ten years. The mother sat by her coffin four days and\r\nnights, speechless and still; we dared not attempt to remove her, there\r\nway an alarming expression in her eyes if we did, that made the medical\r\nmen uncertain how to act. She had tasted no food since the child died;\r\nshe was hopeful to the last: it was impossible, she said, that her child\r\ncould die; her faculties could not comprehend the immensity of the\r\nanguish in store for her. So there she sat like stone--cold, and silent,\r\nand wan, as the effigy she watched. Who dared to awaken the mother?\r\n\r\nMr. Dacre undertook the awful task, but it was almost too much for his\r\ntender, sympathizing heart; nerved by strength from above he came to\r\nus--for I never left my sister--and we three were alone with the dead.\r\n\r\nIt harrows my soul to dwell on this subject, and it seemed cruel to\r\nawaken the benumbed mother to reality and life again, but it was done;\r\nand then words were spoken far too solemn and sacred to repeat here, and\r\nhearts were opened that otherwise might have remained sealed till the\r\njudgment day. Gabrielle, for the first time in her life, knew herself as\r\nshe was; and, prostrate beside her dead child, cried, \"I have deserved\r\nthy chastening rod, for thou art the Lord, and I thy creature; deal with\r\nme as thou seest best.\" Pride abased, hope crushed, heart contrite and\r\nbroken, never, never had Gabrielle been so dear to me; and during many\r\nweeks that I watched beside her couch, as she fluctuated between life\r\nand death, I knew that, she was an altered being, and that this bitter,\r\naffliction had not been sent in vain. She came gently home to God, and\r\nhumbly knelt a suppliant at the mercy-throne, forever crying,\r\n\r\n\"Thou art wisest! Thou art best! Thou, alone knowest what is good for\r\nus! Thy will be done!\"\r\n\r\nThe blow had fallen heavily on Lord Treherne, but for two years my\r\nsister lived to bless and comfort him; then it became evident to all\r\nthat the mother was about to rejoin her child in the mansions of the\r\nblessed. She expressed a wish that Mr. Dacre should read the funeral\r\nservice over her, and he administered the last blessed consolations to\r\nher departing spirit; no remnants of mortal weakness lurked in his heart\r\nas he stood beside the dying, for he knew that in this world they were\r\nas pilgrims and strangers, but in that to which Gabrielle was hastening\r\nthey would be reunited in glory--no more partings, no more tears. She\r\ndied calmly, with her hands clasped in Lord Treherne's and mine; while\r\nMr. Dacre knelt absorbed in prayer she passed away, and we looked on\r\neach other in speechless sorrow, and then on what had been my young and\r\nbeautiful sister.\r\n\r\nOf my own deep grief and lacerated heart I will not speak; Lord Treherne\r\nrequired all my care and attention, nor would he hear of my quitting\r\nhim--indeed, he could scarcely bear me to be out of his sight; the heavy\r\ninfirmities of advanced years had suddenly increased since his double\r\nbereavement, and I felt very grateful that to my humble efforts he owed\r\nany glimpse of sunshine.\r\n\r\nHe was a severe bodily sufferer for many years, but affliction was not\r\nsent in vain, for Lord Treherne became perfectly prepared for the awful\r\nchange awaiting him, trusting in His merits alone. Those were blessed\r\nhours when Mr. Dacre spoke to him of the dear departed, who had only\r\njourneyed on before--of God's ways in bringing us to Himself, chastening\r\npride and self-reliance, and tolerating no idol worship. Lord Treherne,\r\nwith lavish generosity, made an ample provision for his \"wise little\r\nRuth,\" as he ever smilingly called me to the last. He died peacefully,\r\nand the Abbey came into the possession of a distant branch of the\r\nTreherne family.\r\n\r\nWood End Cottage was vacant, and I purchased it; and assisted by Mr.\r\nDacre in the labor of love for our blessed Master, life has not passed\r\nidly, and, I humbly trust, not entirely without being of use in my\r\ngeneration. Previous to his decease, Lord Treherne caused a splendid\r\nmonument to be erected in Wood End church to the memory of Gabrielle,\r\nand Ella his adopted daughter: the spotless marble is exquisitely\r\nwrought, the mother and child reposing side-by-side as if asleep, with\r\ntheir hands meekly folded on their breasts, and their eyes closed, as if\r\nweary--weary.\r\n\r\nThe last fading hues of sunset, which so often rested on Gabrielle's\r\nform as she knelt in her widowhood beneath the monumental glories of the\r\nTrehernes, now illumines the sculptured stone, which mysteriously hints\r\nof hidden things--corruption and the worm.\r\n\r\nI love to kneel in the house of prayer where Gabrielle knelt: dim voices\r\nhaunt me from the past: my place is prepared among the green grass\r\nmounds, for no tablet or record shall mark the spot where \"Ruth the\r\ncripple\" reposes, sweetly slumbering with the sod on her bosom, \"dust to\r\ndust.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WASTE OF WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Give me the gold that war has cost,\r\n      Before this peace-expanding day;\r\n    The wasted skill, the labor lost--\r\n      The mental treasure thrown away;\r\n    And I will buy each rood of soil\r\n      In every yet discovered land;\r\n    Where hunters roam, where peasants toil,\r\n      Where many-peopled cities stand.\r\n\r\n    I'll clothe each shivering wretch on earth.\r\n      In needful; nay, in brave attire;\r\n    Vesture befitting banquet mirth,\r\n      Which kings might envy and admire.\r\n    In every vale, on every plain,\r\n      A school shall glad the gazer's sight;\r\n    Where every poor man's child may gain\r\n      Pure knowledge, free as air and light.\r\n\r\n    I'll build asylums for the poor,\r\n      By age or ailment made forlorn:\r\n    And none shall thrust them from the door,\r\n      Or sting with looks and words of scorn.\r\n    I'll link each alien hemisphere;\r\n      Help honest men to conquer wrong;\r\n    Art, Science, Labor, nerve and cheer;\r\n      Reward the Poet for his song.\r\n\r\n    In every crowded town shall rise\r\n      Halls Academic, amply graced;\r\n    Where Ignorance may soon be wise,\r\n      And Coarseness learn both art and taste\r\n    To every province shall belong\r\n      Collegiate structures, and not few--\r\n    Fill'd with a truth-exploring throng,\r\n      And teachers of the good and true.\r\n\r\n    In every free and peopled clime\r\n      A vast Walhalla hall shall stand;\r\n    A marble edifice sublime,\r\n      For the illustrious of the land;\r\n    A Pantheon for the _truly_ great,\r\n      The wise, beneficent, and just;\r\n    A place of wide and lofty state\r\n      To honor or to hold their dust.\r\n\r\n    A temple to attract and teach\r\n      Shall lift its spire on every hill,\r\n    Where pious men shall feel and preach\r\n      Peace, mercy, tolerance, good-will;\r\n    Music of bells on Sabbath days,\r\n      Round the whole earth shall gladly rise;\r\n    And one great Christian song of praise\r\n      Stream sweetly upward to the skies!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NIGHT WITH AN EARTHQUAKE.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sound had not quite died away, when the feet I stood on seemed\r\nsuddenly seized with the cramp. Cup and coffee-pot dropped as dead from\r\nDon Marzio's hand as the ball from St. Francis's palm. There was a rush\r\nas if of many waters, and for about ten seconds my head was overwhelmed\r\nby awful dizziness, which numbed and paralyzed all sensation. Don\r\nMarzio, in form an athlete, in heart a lion, but a man of sudden,\r\nsanguine temperament, bustled up and darted out of the room with the\r\nease of a man never burdened with a wife, with kith or kin. Donna Betta,\r\na portly matron, also rose instinctively; but I--I never could account\r\nfor the odd freak--laid hold of her arm, bidding her stay. The roar of\r\neight hundred houses--or how many more can there be in Aquila?--all\r\nreeling and quaking, the yells of ten thousand voices in sudden agony,\r\nhad wholly subsided ere I allowed the poor woman calmly and majestically\r\nto waddle up to her good man in the garden. That, I suppose, was my\r\nnotion of an orderly retreat. Rosalbina had flown from a window into the\r\nlawn, like a bird. Thank God, we found ourselves all in the open air\r\nunder the broad canopy of heaven. We began to count heads. Yes, there we\r\nall stood--cook, laundry-maid, dairy-maids, stable-boys, all as obedient\r\nto the awful summons as the best disciplined troops at the first roll of\r\nthe drum.\r\n\r\nIt was February, as I have twice observed; and we were in the heart of\r\nthe highest Apennines. The day was rather fine, but pinching cold; and\r\nwhen the fever of the first terror abated, the lady and young lady began\r\nto shiver in every limb. No one dared to break silence; but Don Marzio's\r\neye wandered significantly enough from one to another countenance in\r\nthat awe-stricken group. There was no mistaking his appeal. Yet, one\r\nafter another, his menials and laborers returned his gaze with\r\nwell-acted perplexity. No one so dull of apprehension as those who will\r\nnot understand. My good friends, I was three-and-twenty. I had had my\r\ntrials, and could boast of pretty narrow escapes. I may have been\r\nreckless, perhaps, in my day. I smiled dimly, nodded to the old\r\ngentleman, clapped my hands cheerily, and the next moment was once more\r\nwhere no man in Aquila would at that moment have liked to be for the\r\nworld--under a roof. I made a huge armful of cloaks and blankets,\r\nsnapped up every rag with all the haste of a marauding party, and moved\r\ntoward the door, tottering under the encumbrance. But now the dreadful\r\ncrisis was at hand.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes, it is well known, proceed by action and re-action. The\r\nsecond shock, I was aware, must be imminent. I had just touched the\r\nthreshold, and stood under the porch, when that curious spasmodic\r\nsensation once more stiffened every muscle in my limbs. Presently I felt\r\nmyself lifted up from the ground. I was now under the portico, and was\r\nhurled against the pillar on my right; the rebound again drove me to the\r\npost on the opposite side; and after being thus repeatedly tossed and\r\nbuffeted from right to left like a shuttlecock, I was thrust down,\r\noutward, on the ground on my head, with all that bundle of rags, having\r\ntumbled head-long the whole range of the four marble steps of entrance.\r\nThe harm, however, was not so great as the fright; and, thanks to my\r\ngallant devotion, the whole party were wrapped and blanketed, till they\r\nlooked like a party of wild Indians; we stood now on comparatively firm\r\nground, and had leisure to look about us. Don Marzio's garden was open\r\nand spacious, being bounded on three sides by the half-crumbling wall of\r\nthe town. On the fourth side was the house--a good, substantial fabric,\r\nbut now miserably shaky and rickety. Close by the house was the chapel\r\nof the Ursuline convent, and above that its slender spire rose chaste\r\nand stainless, \"pointing the way to heaven.\" Any rational being might\r\nhave deemed himself sufficiently removed from brick and mortar, and, in\r\nso far, out of harm's way. Not so Don Marzio. He pointed to the shadow\r\nof that spire, which, in the pale wintry sunset, stretched all the way\r\nacross his garden, and by a strange perversion of judgment, he contended\r\nthat so far as the shadow extended, there might also the body that cast\r\nit reach in its fall, for fall it obviously must; and as the danger was\r\npressing, he deemed it unwise to discuss which of the four cardinal\r\npoints the tower might feel a leaning toward, whenever, under the\r\nimpulse of the subterranean scourge, it would \"look around and choose\r\nits ground.\" Don Marzio was gifted with animal courage, and even nerve,\r\nproportionate to the might of his stalwart frame. But then his was\r\nmerely a combative spirit. Thews and sinews were of no avail in the\r\ncase. The garden was no breathing ground for him, and he resolved upon\r\nprompt emigration.\r\n\r\nThe people of Aquila, as indeed you may well know, of most towns in\r\nSouthern Italy, have the habit of--consequently a peculiar talent\r\nfor--earthquakes. They know how to deal with them, and are seldom caught\r\nunprepared. Two hundred yards outside the town gate, there is half a\r\nsquare mile of table-land on the summit of a hill--a market-place in\r\ndays of ease, a harbor of refuge in the urgency of peril. From the first\r\ndropping of the earth-ball from the hand of their guardian saint, the\r\nmost far-sighted among the inhabitants had been busy pitching their\r\ntents. The whole population--those, that is, who had escaped unscathed\r\nby flying tiles and chimney-pots--were now swarming there, pulling,\r\npushing, hauling, and hammering away for very life: with women fainting,\r\nchildren screeching, Capuchins preaching. It was like a little rehearsal\r\nof doomsday. Don Marzio, a prudent housekeeper, had the latch-key of a\r\nprivate door at the back of the garden. He threw it open--not without a\r\nmisgiving at the moss-grown wall overhead. That night the very stars did\r\nnot seem to him sufficiently firm-nailed to the firmament! His family\r\nand dependents trooped after him, eager to follow. Rosalbina looked\r\nback--at one who was left behind. Don Marzio felt he owed me at least\r\none word of leave-taking. He hemmed twice, came back two steps, and gave\r\nme a feverish shake of the hand.\r\n\r\n\"I am heartily sorry for you, my boy,\" he cried. \"A _fuoruscito_, as I\r\nmay say, a bird-in-the-bush--you dare not show your nose outside the\r\ndoor. You would not compromise yourself alone, you know, but all of us\r\nand our friends; we must leave you--safe enough here, I dare say,\" with\r\na stolen glance at the Ursuline spire, \"but--you see--imperative\r\nduties--head of a family--take care of the females--and so, God bless\r\nyou!\"\r\n\r\nWith this he left me there, under the deadly shade of the\r\nsteeple--deadlier to him than the upas-tree; ordered his little\r\nhousehold band out, and away they filed, one by one, the head of the\r\nfamily manfully closing the rear....\r\n\r\nI was alone--alone with the earthquake.... There was a wood-cellar in\r\none of the out-houses, access to which was easy and safe. One of my\r\nhost's domestics had slipped flint and steel into my hands. In less than\r\nhalf-an-hour's time, a cheerful fire was crackling before me. I drew\r\nforth an old lumbering arm-chair from the wood-cellar, together with my\r\nprovision of fuel. I shrouded myself in the ample folds of one of Don\r\nMarzio's riding-cloaks; I sat with folded arms, my eyes riveted on the\r\nrising blaze, summoning all my spirits round my heart, and bidding it to\r\nbear up. The sun had long set, and the last gleam of a sickly twilight\r\nrapidly faded. A keen, damp, north-east wind swept over the earth; thin,\r\nblack, ragged clouds flitted before it, like uneasy ghosts. A stray star\r\ntwinkled here and there in the firmament, and the sickle-shaped moon\r\nhung in the west. But the light of those pale luminaries was wan and\r\nfitful. They seemed to be aware of the hopelessness of their struggle,\r\nand to mourn in anticipation of the moment when they should faint in\r\nfight, and unrelieved darkness should lord it over the fields of the\r\nheavens.\r\n\r\nThe town of Aquila, or the Eagle, as the natives name it, is perched,\r\neagle-like, on the brow of an abrupt cliff in the bosom of the loftiest\r\nApennines. Monte Reale, Monte Velino, and the giant of the whole chain,\r\nthe \"Gran Sasso d'Italia,\" look down upon it from their exalted thrones.\r\nWithin the shelter of that massive armor, the town might well seem\r\ninvulnerable to time and man. But now, as I gazed despondingly round,\r\nthe very hills everlasting seemed rocking from their foundation, and\r\ntheir crests nodding to destruction. Which of those mighty peaks was to\r\nopen the fire of hell's artillery upon us? Was not Etna once as still\r\nand dark as yonder great rock? and yet it now glares by night with its\r\nominous beacon, and cities and kingdoms have been swept away at its\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nTwo hours passed away in gloomy meditation. The whole town was a desert.\r\nThe camp meeting of the unhoused Aquilani was held somewhere in the\r\ndistance: its confused murmur reached me not. Only my neighbors, the\r\nUrsuline nuns, were up and awake. With shrinking delicacy, dreading the\r\nlook and touch of the profane even more than the walls of their\r\nprison-house, they had stood their ground with the heroism of true\r\nfaith, and reared their temporary asylum under their vine-canopied\r\nbowers, within the shade of the cloisters. A high garden-wall alone\r\nseparated me from the holy virgins. They were watching and kneeling.\r\nEvery note from their silver voices sank deep in my heart, and impressed\r\nme with something of that pious confidence, of that imploring fervor,\r\nwith which they addressed their guardian angels and saints. Two hours\r\nhad passed. The awfulness of prevailing tranquillity, the genial warmth\r\nof my fire, and the sweet monotony of that low, mournful chanting, were\r\nby degrees gliding into my troubled senses, and lulling them into a\r\ntreacherous security. \"Just so,\" I reasoned, \"shock and countershock.\r\nThe terrible scourge has by this time exhausted its strength. It was\r\nonly a farce, after all. Much ado about nothing. The people of this town\r\nhave become so familiar with the earthquake that they make a carnival of\r\nit. By this time they are perhaps feasting and rioting under their\r\nbooths. Ho! am I the only craven here? And had I not my desire? Am I not\r\nnow on speaking terms with an earthquake?\"\r\n\r\nAgain my words conjured up the waking enemy. A low, hollow, rumbling\r\nnoise, as if from many hundred miles' distance, was heard coming rapidly\r\nonward along the whole line of the Apennines. It reached us, it seemed\r\nto stop underneath our feet, and suddenly changing its horizontal for a\r\nvertical direction, it burst upward. The whole earth heaved with a\r\nsudden pang; it then gave a backward bound, even as a vessel shipping a\r\nsea. The motion then became undulatory, and spread far and wide as the\r\nreport of a cannon, awakening every echo in the mountain. There was a\r\nrattle and clatter in the town, as if of a thousand wagons shooting down\r\npaving stones. The Ursuline steeple waved in the air like a reed vexed\r\nby the blast. The chair I stood on was all but capsized, and the fire at\r\nmy feet was overthrown. The very vault of heaven swung to and fro,\r\nebbing and heaving with the general convulsion. The doleful psalmody in\r\nthe neighboring ground broke abruptly. The chorus of many feminine\r\nvoices sent forth but one rending shriek. The clamor of thousands of the\r\ntown-folk from their encampment gave its wakeful response. Then the dead\r\nsilence of consternation ensued. I picked up every stick and brand that\r\nhad been scattered about, steadied myself in my chair, and hung down my\r\nhead. \"These black hounds,\" I mused, \"hunt in couples. Now for the\r\nrepercussion.\"\r\n\r\nI had not many minutes to wait. Again the iron-hoofed steeds and heavy\r\nwheels of the state chariot of the prince of darkness were heard\r\ntramping and rattling in their course. Once more the subterranean\r\navalanche gathered and burst. Once more the ground beneath throbbed and\r\nheaved as if with rending travail. Once more heaven and earth seemed to\r\nyearn to each other; and the embers of my watch-fire were cast upward\r\nand strewn asunder. It was an awful long winter night. The same sable\r\nclouds rioting in the sky, the same cruel wind moaning angrily through\r\nthe chinks and crevices of many a shattered edifice. Solitude, the\r\nchillness of night, and the vagueness, even more than the\r\ninevitableness, of the danger, wrought fearfully on my exhausted frame.\r\nStupor and lethargy soon followed these brief moments of speechless\r\nexcitement. Bewildered imagination peopled the air with vague,\r\nunutterable terrors. Legions of phantoms sported on those misshapen\r\nclouds. The clash of a thousand swords was borne on the wind. Tongues of\r\nliving flame danced and quivered in every direction. The firmament\r\nseemed all burning with them. I saw myself alone, helpless, hopeless,\r\nthe miserable butt of all the rage of warring elements. It was an\r\nuncomfortable night. Ten and twelve times was the dreadful visitation\r\nreproduced between sunset and sunrise, and every shock found me more\r\nutterly unnerved; and the sullen, silent resignation with which I\r\nrecomposed and trimmed my fire had something in it consummately abject,\r\nby the side of the doleful accents with which the poor half-hoarse nuns,\r\nmy neighbors, called on their blessed Virgin for protection.\r\n\r\nThe breaking morn found me utterly prostrated; and when Don Marzio's\r\nservants had so far recovered from their panic as to intrude upon my\r\nsolitude, and offer their services for the erection of my tent in the\r\ngarden, I had hardly breath enough left to welcome them. Under that tent\r\nI passed days and nights during all the remainder of February. The\r\nshocks, though diminished in strength, almost nightly roused us from our\r\nrest. But the people of Aquila soon learned to despise them. By one, by\r\ntwo, by three they sought the threshold of their dismantled homes. Last\r\nof all, Don Marzio folded his tent. His fears having, finally, so far\r\ngiven way, as to allow him to think of something beside himself, he\r\nexerted himself to free me from confinement. He furnished me with\r\nfaithful guides, by whose aid I reached the sea-coast. Here a Maltese\r\nvessel was waiting to waft me to a land of freedom and security. I can\r\ntell you, my friends, that from that time I was cured forever of all\r\ncuriosity about earthquakes.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] From a work entitled \"Scenes of Italian Life,\" by L. Mariotti, just\r\npublished in London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLEA FOR BRITISH REPTILES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the flourishing tradesman writes with pride over his shop, we might\r\nin most cases write over our storehouse of antipathies--established in\r\n1720, or 1751. For what good reason we, in 1851, should shudder at the\r\ncontact of a spider, or loathe toads, it would be hard to say. Our\r\nforefathers in their ignorance did certainly traduce the characters of\r\nmany innocent and interesting animals, and many of us now believe some\r\nportions of their scandal. To be a reptile, for example, is perhaps the\r\ngreatest disgrace that can attach to any animal in our eyes. Reptile\r\npasses for about the worst name you can call a man. This is unjust--at\r\nany rate, in England. We have no thought of patting crocodiles under the\r\nchin, or of embracing boa constrictors; but for our English reptiles we\r\nclaim good words and good-will. We beg to introduce here, formally, our\r\nunappreciated friends to any of our human friends who may not yet have\r\ncultivated their acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThe Common Lizard--surely you know the Common Lizard, if not by his name\r\nof state--_Zootoca vivipara_. He wears a brilliant jacket, and you have\r\nmade friends with him, as a nimble, graceful fellow; as a bit of\r\nmidsummer. His very name reminds you of a warm bank in the country, and\r\na sunny day. Is he a reptile? Certainly; suppose we stop two minutes to\r\nremember what a reptile is.\r\n\r\nThe heart of a reptile has three cavities; that is to say, it is not\r\ncompletely double, like our own. It sends only a small part of the blood\r\nwhich comes into it for renovation into the air-chambers--the lungs;\r\nwhile the remainder circulates again unpurified. That change made in the\r\nblood by contact with the oxygen of air, is chiefly the cause of heat in\r\nanimals. Aëration, therefore, being in reptiles very partial, the amount\r\nof heat evolved is small; reptiles are therefore called cold-blooded.\r\nThey are unable to raise their heat above the temperature of the\r\nsurrounding air. Fishes are cold-blooded, through deficient aëration in\r\nanother way; in them, all the blood passes from the heart into the place\r\nwhere air shall come in contact with it; but, then there is a limitation\r\nto the store of air supplied, which can be no more than the quantity\r\nextracted from the water. The temperature of water is maintained below\r\nthe surface, and we know how that of the air varies, since a certain\r\nquantity of heat is necessary to the vital processes; reptiles,\r\ndepending upon air for heat, hybernate or become torpid when the\r\ntemperature falls below a certain point. The rapidity of all their vital\r\nactions will depend upon the state of the thermometer; they digest\r\nfaster in the heat of summer than in the milder warmth of spring. Their\r\nsecretions (as the poison of the adder) are in hot weather more copious,\r\nand in winter are not formed at all. The reptiles breathe, in all cases,\r\nby lungs; but we must except here those called _Batrachians_, as frogs\r\nor newts, which breathe, in the first stage, by gills, and afterward by\r\ngills and lungs, or by lungs only. The _Batrachians_, again, are the\r\nonly exception to another great characteristic of the reptile class, the\r\nhard, dry covering of plates or scales. The reptiles all produce their\r\nyoung from eggs, or are \"oviparous\"--some hatch their eggs within the\r\nbody, and produce their young alive, or are \"ovo-viviparous.\" These are\r\nthe characters belonging to all members of the reptile-class. The class\r\nis subdivided into orders somewhat thus: 1. The _Testudinate_ (tortoises\r\nand turtles). 2. _Enaliosaurian_ (all fossil, the _Ichthyosaurus_ and\r\nhis like). 3. _Loricate_ (crocodiles and alligators). 4. _Saurian_\r\n(lizards). 5. _Ophidian_ (serpents); and the last order, _Batrachian_\r\n(frogs, toads, &c.); which is, by some, parted from the reptiles, and\r\nestablished as another class.\r\n\r\nNow we have in England no tortoises or turtles, and no crocodiles: and\r\nthe fossil order is, in all places, extinct; so our reptiles can belong\r\nonly to the three last-named orders, Lizards, Serpents, and Batrachians.\r\n\r\nThus we come back, then, to our Lizards, of which we have among us but\r\ntwo genera, a single species of each. These are the Common Lizard, well\r\nknown to us all, and the Sand Lizard, known only to some of us who\r\nhappen to live upon the southern coast. The species of lizard so\r\nextremely common in this country, has not been found in countries\r\nfarther south, and is, in fact, peculiar to our latitude. We, therefore,\r\nmay love him as a sympathetic friend. The sand lizard (_Lacerta agilis_)\r\nis found as far north as the country of Linnæus, and as far south as the\r\nnorthern part of France; in England, however, it seems to be rare, and\r\nhas been detected only in Dorsetshire--chiefly near Poole, or in some\r\nother southern counties. It frequents sandy heaths, and is of a brown\r\nsandy color, marked and dotted; but there is a green variety said to be\r\nfound among the verdure of marshy places. It is larger than our common\r\nlizard, averaging seven inches long, is very timid, and when made a\r\nprisoner pines and dies. Its female lays eggs, like a turtle, in the\r\nsand, covers them over, and leaves them to be hatched by the summer sun.\r\nThis kind of lizard, therefore, is oviparous. The eggs of our common\r\nlizard are hatched also by the sun; for, reptiles having no heat of\r\ntheir own, can not provide that which is necessary to the development of\r\nan embryo; but in this case the sun hatches them within the parent's\r\nbody. The female of this lizard stretches herself out upon a sunny bank,\r\nand lets the bright rays fall upon her body while she lies inactive. At\r\nthis period, she will not move for any thing less than a real cause of\r\nalarm. She is not sunning herself lazily, however, but fulfilling an\r\nordinance of God. The eggs break as the young lizards--three to six--are\r\nborn. This lizard is, therefore, ovo-viviparous. The little ones begin\r\nat once to run about, and soon dart after insects, their proper food;\r\nbut they accompany the mother with some instinct of affection for a\r\nlittle time. These lizards are very various in size and color;\r\ndifference in these respects does not denote difference in kind. The\r\nlittle scales which cover them are arranged in a peculiar manner on the\r\nhead, under the neck, &c.; and some differences of arrangement, in such\r\nrespects, are characteristic. The best distinction between the only two\r\nspecies of lizard known in this country has been pointed out by Mr.\r\nBell. In the hind legs, under each thigh, there is a row of openings,\r\neach opening upon a single scale. In sand lizards, the opening is\r\nobviously smaller than the scale; in our common lizards, the opening is\r\nso comparatively large that the scale seems to be the mere edge of a\r\ntube around it.\r\n\r\nThese are our lizards, then, our Saurian reptiles; and they do not merit\r\nany hate. Suffer an introduction now to English Snakes.\r\n\r\nThe first snake, the Blindworm, is not a snake, nor yet a worm. It is a\r\nhalf-way animal--between a lizard and a snake. The lizards shade off so\r\ninsensibly into the snakes, even the boa preserving rudimentary hind\r\nlegs, that some naturalists counsel their union into a single class of\r\nSquamate, or scaled reptiles. By a milder process of arrangement, all\r\nthose animals which dwell upon the frontier ground between Lizards or\r\nSaurians, and Ophidians or Snakes, are to be called Saurophidian. The\r\nblindworm then, is Saurophidian; it is quite as much a lizard as a\r\nsnake. Snakes have the bones of their head all movable, so that their\r\njaws can be dilated, until, like carpet-bags, they swallow any thing.\r\nThe lizard has its jaws fixed; so has the blindworm. Snakes have a long\r\ntongue, split for some distance, and made double-forked; the blindworm's\r\ntongue has nothing but a little notch upon the tip. It has a smooth\r\nround muzzle, with which it can easily wind its way under dry soil to\r\nhybernate; or else it takes a winter nap in any large heap of dead\r\nleaves. It comes out early in the spring; for it can bear more cold than\r\nreptiles generally like, and it is found all over Europe, from Sweden to\r\nthe south of Italy. It feeds upon worms, slugs, and insects. Like the\r\nsnakes, it gets a new coat as it grows, and takes the old one off, by\r\nhooking it to some fixed point, and crawling from it, so that the cast\r\nskin is dragged backward, and turned inside out. The slow-worm is of a\r\ndark gray color, silvery, and about a foot long on the average. It is\r\novo-viviparous. It is extremely gentle; very rarely thinks of biting\r\nthose who handle it, and, when it does bite, inflicts no wound with its\r\nlittle teeth. Of course it has no fangs and is not poisonous. Shrinking\r\nwith fear when taken, it contracts its body and so stiffens it that it\r\nwill break if we strike or bend it. Therefore it bears the name Linnæus\r\ngave it--_Anguis fragilis_.\r\n\r\nWe have found nothing yet to shudder at among our reptiles. \"O! but,\"\r\nyou say perhaps, \"that was not a real snake.\" Well, here is our real\r\nsnake. _Natrix torquata_--our common Ringed Snake; he is very common. He\r\nmay be three or four feet long, and brownish-gray above, with a green\r\ntinge, yellow marks upon the neck, and rows of black spots down the back\r\nand sides, alternating, like London lamp-posts, with each other. You\r\nwill find him any where in England, almost any where in Europe, below\r\nthe latitude of Scotland. You will find him most frequently in a moist\r\nplace, or near water, for he is rather proud of himself as a swimmer. He\r\nhas a handsome coat, and gets a new one two, three, four, or five times\r\nin a season, if his growth require it. When the new coat is quite hard\r\nand fit for use under the old, he strips the old one off among the\r\nthorn-bushes. He and his lady hybernate. The lady leaves her sixteen or\r\ntwenty eggs, all glued together, for the sun to vivify. The snake's\r\ntongue, as we have said, is forked, the jaws dilatable; he prefers frogs\r\nfor his dinner, but is satisfied with mice, or little birds, or\r\nlizards. He swallows his prey whole. Catching it first, as Mrs. Glasse\r\nwould say, between his teeth, which are in double rows upon each jaw,\r\nand directed backward that they may act more effectually, he first\r\nbrings the victim to a suitable position--head first he prefers, then,\r\nleaving one set of teeth, say the lower, fixed, he advances the upper\r\njaw, fixes its teeth into the skin, and leaves them there while he moves\r\nforward, the lower jaw, and so continues till the bird or frog is worked\r\ninto his throat; it is then swallowed by the agency of other muscles.\r\nThis power of moving each jaw freely and in independence of the other,\r\nis peculiar to Ophidian reptiles. The frog may reach the stomach both\r\nalive and active, so that, if afterward, the snake gapes, as he is apt\r\nto do, a frog has been seen to leap out again. The processes of life are\r\nso slow in reptiles, that one meal will not be digested by the snake for\r\nmany days. He is unable to digest vegetable matter. Our snake is very\r\nharmless, and if kept and fed, will quickly learn to recognize its\r\npatron, will feed out of his hand, and nestle up his sleeve; but he\r\nshows a dread of strangers.\r\n\r\nWe have Adders? Yes, we have a Viper--_Pelias Berus_ is the name he goes\r\nby, and his fangs are undeniable. This is the only native reptile that\r\ncan, in any degree whatever, hurt a man. It is common in England, and,\r\nunlike the snake, prefers a dry place to a moist one. \"Adder\" and\r\n\"viper\" are two words applied to the same thing--adder being derived\r\nfrom the Saxon word for \"nether,\" and viper from viviper; because this\r\nreptile, like our common lizard, hatches her eggs within the body, or is\r\nviviparous. Our viper is found all over Europe; not in Ireland. As for\r\nIreland, it is an old boast with the Irish that Saint Patrick banned\r\naway all reptiles. The paucity of reptiles in Ireland is remarkable, but\r\nthey are not altogether absent. Our common lizard has a large Irish\r\nconnection, and frogs were introduced into Ireland years ago. Their\r\nspawn was taken over, put into water, throve, and thereafter frogs have\r\nmultiplied. An attempt was also made to introduce our common snake, but\r\nthe country-people, with great horror, killed the inlopers; a reward\r\neven was offered for one that was known to remain uncaptured. Ireland is\r\nfree from adders.\r\n\r\nThe most ready distinction between a common snake and an adder, to\r\nunfamiliar eyes, is founded on the difference of marking. While the\r\nsnake has separate alternate spots, the adder has, down its back, a\r\nchain of dark spots, irregularly square, and joined to one another.\r\nAdders are generally brown, but differ very much in color. They have on\r\ntheir upper jaw, instead of their lower, a row of teeth, the well-known\r\nfangs. These are long, curved teeth, fixed into a movable piece of bone,\r\nand hollow. The hollow is not made out of the substance of the tooth; it\r\nis as if a broad flat tooth had been bent round upon itself to form a\r\ntube. The tube is open below and behind, in the curve, by a little\r\nslit. Above, it is open, and rests upon a tiny bag connected with a\r\ngland that corresponds to a gland in man for the secretion of saliva;\r\nbut which, in the present case, secretes a poison. The fang, when out of\r\nuse, is bent and hidden in a fleshy case; in feeding, it is rarely used.\r\nThe viper catches for himself his birds or mice, after the manner of a\r\nharmless serpent. But, when hurt or angered, he throws back his neck,\r\ndrops his fang ready for service, bites, and withdraws his head\r\nimmediately. The fang in penetrating, of necessity, was pressed upon the\r\nlittle bag of poison at its root, and forced a drop along the tube into\r\nthe wound. After a few bites, the bag becomes exhausted, and the adder\r\nmust wait for a fresh secretion. The poison has no taste or smell, and\r\nmay be swallowed with impunity, if there be no raw surface in the mouth,\r\nor sore upon the throat, or in the stomach. It is only through a wound\r\nthat it can act like poison. The bite of an adder in this country never\r\nyet proved fatal; but, according to the health of the person bitten, and\r\naccording to the greater or less heat of the weather (for in very hot\r\nweather a more active poison is secreted), the wound made will be more\r\nor less severe. It is advisable to get out of an adder's way.\r\n\r\nAll the remaining reptiles in this country are two species of Frog, two\r\nspecies of Toad, and four Newts. They are not only most absolutely\r\nharmless, but, the frogs, at any rate, and toads, are ministers to man;\r\nand they belong to a class of animals more interesting than any other,\r\nperhaps, in the whole range of natural history. We are all well\r\nacquainted with the common frog, whose grander name is _Rana\r\ntemporaria._ We see it--and it is to be feared some of us kill it--in\r\nour gardens, among strawberry-beds and damp vegetation. But, whereas\r\nfrogs feed upon those slugs and insects which are in the habit of\r\npasturing upon our plants, and are themselves indebted to us for not a\r\ngrain of vegetable matter, we ought by all means to be grateful to them.\r\nSo industrious are frogs in slug-hunting, that it would be quite worth\r\nwhile to introduce them as sub-gardeners upon our flower-beds. In\r\ncatching insects, the frog suddenly darts out his tongue, which, at the\r\nhinder part, is loose, and covered with a gummy matter. The insect is\r\ncaught, and the tongue returned with wonderful rapidity. The frog, when\r\nit is first hatched, has the constitution of a fish: it is purely\r\naquatic; has a fish's heart, a fish's circulation, and a fish's gills.\r\nThe tadpole swims as a fish does--by the movement, side-ways, of its\r\ntail. For the unassisted eye, and still more for the microscope, what\r\nspectacle can be more marvelous than the gradual process of change by\r\nwhich this tiny fish becomes a reptile? Legs bud; the fish-like gills\r\ndwindle by a vital process of absorption; the fish-like air-bladder\r\nbecomes transmuted, as by a miracle, into the celled structure of lungs;\r\nthe tail grows daily shorter, not broken off, but absorbed; the heart\r\nadds to its cells; the fish becomes a reptile as the tadpole changes to\r\na frog. The same process we observe in toads; and it is also the same in\r\nour newts, excepting that in newts the tail remains. There is no\r\nparallel in nature to this marvelous and instructive metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nThe perfectly-formed frog does not live of necessity in water, or near\r\nit, but requires damp air occasionally. It breathes by lungs, as we have\r\nsaid; but, as it has no ribs, there is no chest to heave mechanically.\r\nThe frog's air has to be swallowed, to be gulped down into the lungs.\r\nThat is not possible unless the mouth is shut; and, therefore, as we\r\nmight suffocate a man by keeping his mouth shut, so we should suffocate\r\na frog by keeping his mouth open. Yet we should not suffocate him\r\ninstantly; we should disable the lungs; but, in this class of animals\r\nthe whole skin is a breathing surface. A frog has lived a month after\r\nhis lungs had been extracted. All respiratory surfaces, like the inside\r\nof our own lungs, can act only when they are relaxed and moist. That is\r\nthe reason why a frog's skin is always moist, and why a frog requires\r\nmoist air. It does not need this constantly, because, when moisture is\r\nabundant, there is a bag in which it stores up superfluity of water, to\r\nbe used in any day of need. It is this water--pure and clear--which\r\nfrogs or toads expel when they are alarmed by being handled. Is not\r\nenough said here, to rescue frogs from our contempt? We may add, that\r\nthey are capable of understanding kindness--can be tamed. Frogs\r\nhybernate under the mud of ponds, where they lie close together, in a\r\nstratum, till the spring awakens them to a renewal of their lives and\r\nloves. They lay a vast number of eggs, at the bottom of the water; and\r\nthe multitudes of young frogs that swarm upon the shore when their\r\ntransformation is; complete, has given rise to many legends of a shower\r\nof frogs. These multitudes provide food for many animals, serpents, as\r\nwe have seen, birds, fish. And the survivors are our friends.\r\n\r\nThe other species of frog found in this country is the Edible Frog\r\n(_Rana esculenta_). It has for a long time had a colony in Foulmire Fen,\r\nin Cambridgeshire, although properly belonging to a continental race. It\r\ndiffers from our common frog in wanting a dark mark that runs from eye\r\nto shoulder, and in having, instead of it, a light mark--a streak--from\r\nhead to tail along the centre of the back. The male is a more portentous\r\ncroaker than our own familiar musicians, by virtue of an air-bladder on\r\neach cheek, into which air is forced, and in which it vibrates\r\npowerfully during the act of croaking. This kind of frog is always in or\r\nnear the water, and being very timid, plunges out of sight if any one\r\napproaches.\r\n\r\nThese are our frogs; as for our two Toads, they are by no means less\r\ninnocent. They are the Common Toad, by style and title _Bufo vulgaris,_\r\nand a variety of the Natter Jack Toad, to be found on Blackheath, and in\r\nmany places about London, and elsewhere. The toad undergoes\r\ntransformations like the frog. It is slower in its movements, and less\r\nhandsome in appearance: similar in structure. There is a somewhat\r\nunpleasant secretion from its skin, a product of respiration. There is\r\nnothing about it in the faintest degree poisonous. It is remarkably\r\nsensible of kindness; more so than the frog. Examples of tame toads are\r\nnot uncommon. Stories are told of the discovery of toads alive, in\r\nblocks of marble, where no air could be; but, there has been difficulty,\r\nhitherto, in finding one such example free from the possibility of\r\nerror. It may be found, however, that toads can remain for a series of\r\nyears torpid. It has been proved that snails, after apparent death of\r\nfifteen years, have become active on applying moisture. A proof equally\r\ndistinct is at present wanting in the case of toads. The toad, like\r\nother reptiles, will occasionally cast its skin. The old skin splits\r\nalong the back, and gradually parts, until it comes off on each side,\r\nwith a little muscular exertion on the toad's part. Then, having rolled\r\nhis jacket up into a ball, he eats it!\r\n\r\nNo reptiles remain now to be mentioned, but four species of Newt. These\r\nlittle creatures are abundant in our ponds and ditches, and some are\r\nmost falsely accused of being poisonous. They are utterly harmless.\r\nTheir transformations, their habits, their changes of skin, their laying\r\nof eggs, can easily be watched by any who will keep them in a miniature\r\npond. A large pan of water, with sand and stones at the bottom, decayed\r\nvegetable matter for food, and a few living water-plants, extracted from\r\ntheir native place, will keep a dozen newts in comfort. The water-plants\r\nare needed, because a newt prefers to lay her egg upon a leaf. She\r\nstands upon it, curls it up with her hind legs, and puts an egg between\r\nthe fold, where it remains glued. These being our reptiles, are they\r\nproper objects of abhorrence? At this season they are all finishing\r\ntheir winter nap. In a few weeks they will come among us, and then, when\r\n\r\n        \"the songs, the stirring air,\r\n      The life re-orient out of dust,\r\n      Cry through the sense to hearten trust\r\n    In that which made the world so fair\"--\r\n\r\nmay we not permit our hearts to be admonished by the reptiles also?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[From Leigh Hunt's Journal.]\r\n\r\nA DREAM, AND THE INTERPRETATION THEREOF.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey stood by her bedside--the father and mother of the maiden--and\r\nwatched her slumbers. For she had returned weary from Seville, after a\r\nlong absence from this her Lisbon home. They had not gazed on that fair\r\ninnocent face for many a month past; and _they_, too, smiled, and\r\npressed each the other's hand as they marked a radiant smile playing\r\nround the mouth of the sleeper. It was a smile brimful of happiness--the\r\nwelling-up of a heart at perfect peace. And it brought gladness to the\r\nhearts of the parents, who-would fain have kissed the cheek of their\r\ngentle girl, but refrained, lest it should break the spell--lest even a\r\nfather's and a mother's kiss should dull the blessedness of the dreamer.\r\nSo sleep on, Luise! and smile ever as thou sleepest--though it be the\r\nsleep of death.\r\n\r\nThese people were poor in worldly goods, but rich in the things of home\r\nand heart. Luise, the first-born, had been staying with a Spanish\r\nrelative, who had taken charge of her education, and had now come back\r\nto her native Lisbon \"for good.\" Three younger children there\r\nwere--blithe, affectionate prattlers--whose glee at the recovery of\r\nLuise had been so exuberant, so boisterous, that they were now sent to\r\nplay in the neighboring vineyards, that they might not disturb their\r\ntired sister's repose.\r\n\r\nLong played that smile upon her face; and never were the two gazers\r\ntired of gazing, and of smiling as they gazed. Luise, they thought, had\r\nseemed a little sad as well as weary when she alighted at the dear\r\nfamiliar door. But this smile was so full of joy unspeakable, so fraught\r\nwith beatific meaning, so reflective of beatific vision, that it laughed\r\ntheir fears away, and spoke volumes where the seeming sorrow had not\r\nspoken even words.\r\n\r\nThe shrill song of a mule-driver passing by the window aroused the\r\nsleeper. The smile vanished, and as she started up and looked hastily\r\nand inquiringly around, a shade of mingled disappointment and\r\nbewilderment gathered darkly on her brow.\r\n\r\n\"You must turn and go to sleep again, my child,\" whispered the mother.\r\n\"I wish Pedro were not so proud of his voice, and then you might still\r\nbe dreaming of pleasant things.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _was_ dreaming, then?\" said Luise, somewhat sadly. \"I thought it was\r\nreal, and it made me _so_ happy! Ah, if I could dream it again, and\r\nagain--three times running, you know--till it became true!\"\r\n\r\n\"What was it, Luise?\" asked her father. \"We must know what merry thought\r\nmade you so joyful. It will be a dream worth knowing, and, therefore,\r\nworth telling.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at present,\" interrupted his wife. \"Let her get some more rest; and\r\nthen, when she is thoroughly refreshed after such a tedious journey, she\r\nwill make us all happy with realities as well as dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\"And are dreams never realities?\" asked the girl, with a sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Child! child! if we're going to be philosophical, and all that, we\r\nshall never get you to sleep again. Don't talk any more, my Luise; but\r\nclose your eyes, and see if _you_ can't realize a dream; that will be\r\nthe best answer to your question.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't go to sleep again,\" she answered. \"See, I'm quite awake, and\r\nit's no use trying. And with the sun so high too! No; you shall send me\r\nto bed an hour or two earlier to-night, and to-morrow morning will find\r\nme as brisk as a bee. I've so much to hear, and so much to tell, that\r\nto sleep again before dusk is out of the question.\"\r\n\r\nSo she arose; and they went all three and sat down in the little garden.\r\nLuise eyed eagerly every flower and every fruit-tree, and had something\r\nto say about every change since she had been there last. But ever and\r\nanon she would look earnestly into the faces of her parents--and never\r\nwithout something like a tear in her large lustrous eyes.\r\n\r\nOf course, they questioned her upon this. And she, who had never\r\nconcealed a thought or a wish from _them_, told them in her own frank,\r\nartless way, why she looked sorrowful when she first saw them, after a\r\nprolonged separation, and how it was that, in her sleep, thoughts had\r\nvisited her which were messengers of peace and gladness--whose message\r\nit had saddened her to find, on waking, but airy and unreal.\r\n\r\nAt Seville she had been as happy as kindness and care could make one so\r\nfar from and so fond of home. But a childish fancy, she said, had\r\ntroubled her--childish she knew, and a thing to be ashamed of, but\r\nhaunting her none the less--visiting her sleeping and waking hours; a\r\nfeeling it was of dejection at the idea of her parents growing old, and\r\nof change and chance breaking up the wonted calm of her little household\r\ncircle. That the march of Time should be so irresistible, that his\r\nflight could not be stayed or slackened by pope or kaiser, that his\r\ndecrees should be so immutable, his destiny so inexorable, and that the\r\nyoungest must soon cease to be young, and the middle-aged become old--or\r\ndie! this was the thought that preyed on her very soul. She could not\r\nendure the conviction that her own father must one day walk with a less\r\nelastic step, and smile on her with eyes ever loving indeed, but more\r\nand more dimmed with age--and that her own mother must one day move to\r\nand fro with tottering gait, and speak with the tremulous accents of\r\nthose old people who, it seemed to Luise, could never have been children\r\nat all. It was a weak, fantastic thought, this; but she could not master\r\nit, nor escape its presence.\r\n\r\nAnd when she met them on the threshold of the beloved home--ah, the\r\nabsentee's rapid glance saw a wrinkle on her father's cheek that was new\r\nto her, and it saw a clustering of gray hairs on her mother's brow,\r\nwhere all had been raven black when Luise departed for Seville. Poor\r\nLuise! The sorrows of her young heart were enlarged. Time had not been\r\nabsent with the pensive absentee.\r\n\r\nTrue, he had stolen no charm from her little playmates. Carlos was a\r\nbrighter boy than ever; and as for that merry Zingara-like Isabel, and\r\nthe yet merrier Manuel--they were not a whit changed, unless for the\r\nbetter, in look, and manner, and love. Still the too-sensitive Luise was\r\nhurt at the thought that they could not always be children--that Time\r\nwas bent on effacing her earliest and dearest impressions, removing from\r\nher home that ideal of family relationship to which all her affections\r\nclung with passionate entreaty. Whatever the future might; have to\r\nreveal of enjoyment and endearment, the past could never be lived over\r\nagain; the past could never be identified with things present and things\r\nto come; and it was to the past that her heart was betrothed--a past\r\nthat had gone the way of all living, and left her as it were widowed and\r\nnot to be comforted.\r\n\r\n\"And now I will tell you my dream,\" said poor foolish Luise; \"and you\r\nwill see why I looked happy in sleeping, and sorry in waking. I thought\r\nI was sitting here in the garden--crying over what I have been telling\r\nyou--and suddenly an angel stood before me, and bade me weep not.\r\nStrange as was his form, and sunny in its exceeding brightness, I was\r\nnot frightened; for his words were very, very gentle, and his look too\r\nfull of kindness to give me one thrill of alarm. And he said that what I\r\nhad longed for so much should be granted; that my father and mother\r\nshould _not_ grow old, nor Carlos cease to be the boy he now is, nor\r\nIsabel grow up into a sedate woman, nor Manuel lose the gay childishness\r\nfor which we all pet him, nor I feel myself forsaking the old familiar\r\npast, and launching into dim troublous seas of perpetual change. He\r\npromised that we should one and all be freed from the great law of time;\r\nand that as we are this day parents and children, so we should continue\r\nforever--while vicissitude and decay must still have sway in the great\r\nworld at large. Can you wonder that I smiled? Or that it pained me when\r\nI awoke, and found that the bright angel and the sweet promise were\r\nonly--a dream?\"...\r\n\r\nThere was no lack of conversation that evening in that Lisbon cottage.\r\nAll loved Luise; and she, in the midst of so many artless tokens of\r\naffection and of triumph at her return, forgot all the morbid fancies\r\nthat had given rise to her dream, and was as light-hearted, and as\r\nlight-footed, as in days of yore. All gave themselves up to the reality\r\nof present gladness; every voice trembled with the music of joy; every\r\neye looked and reflected love. There was no happier homestead that\r\nevening in Lisbon, nor in the world.\r\n\r\nBut ere many hours, Lisbon itself was tossing and heaving with the\r\nthroes of dissolution. The sea arose tumultuously against the tottering\r\ncity; the ground breathed fire, and quaked, and burst asunder; the\r\nhouses reeled and fell, and thousands of inhabitants perished in the\r\nfall. Among them, at one dire swoop, the tenants of that happy cottage\r\nhome. Together did these mortals put on immortality.\r\n\r\nAnd thus was the dream fulfilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSEHOLD OF SIR THO'S MORE.[7]\r\n\r\nLIBELLUS A MARGARETA MORE, QUINDECIM ANNOS NATA, CHELSEIÆ INCEPTVS.\r\n\r\n    \"Nulla dies sine linea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis morn, hinting to Bess that she was lacing herselfe too straightlie,\r\nshe brisklie replyed, \"One w'd think 'twere as great meritt to have a\r\nthick waiste as to be one of y'e earlie Christians!\"\r\n\r\nThese humourous retorts are ever at her tongue's end; and, albeit, as\r\nJacky one day angrilie remarked, when she had beene teazing him, \"Bess,\r\nthy witt is stupidnesse;\" yet, for one who talks soe much at random, no\r\none can be more keene when she chooseth. Father sayd of her, half\r\nfondly, half apologeticallie to Erasmus, \"Her wit has a fine subtletie\r\nthat eludes you almoste before you have time to recognize it for what it\r\nreally is.\" To which, Erasmus readilie assented, adding, that it had\r\ny'e rare meritt of playing less on persons than things, and never on\r\nbodilie defects.\r\n\r\nHum!--I wonder if they ever sayd as much in favour of me. I know,\r\nindeede, Erasmus calls me a forward girl. Alas! that may be taken in two\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGrievous work, overnighte, with y'e churning. Nought w'd persuade\r\nGillian but that y'e creame was bewitched by Gammer Gurney, who was\r\ndissatisfyde last Friday with her dole, and hobbled away mumping and\r\ncursing. At alle events, y'e butter w'd not come; but mother was\r\nresolute not to have soe much goode creame wasted; soe sent for Bess and\r\nme, Daisy and Mercy Giggs, and insisted on our churning in turn till\r\ny'e butter came, if we sate up all nighte for't. 'Twas a hard saying;\r\nand mighte have hampered her like as Jephtha his rash vow: howbeit, soe\r\nsoone as she had left us, we turned it into a frolick, and sang Chevy\r\nChase from end to end, to beguile time; ne'erthelesse, the butter w'd\r\nnot come; soe then we grew sober, and, at y'e instance of sweete\r\nMercy, chaunted y'e 119th Psalme; and, by the time we had attayned to\r\n\"Lucerna pedibus,\" I hearde y'e buttermilk separating and splashing in\r\nrighte earneste. 'Twas neare midnighte, however; and Daisy had fallen\r\nasleep on y'e dresser. Gillian will ne'er be convinced but that our\r\nLatin brake the spell.\r\n\r\nErasmus went to Richmond this morning with Polus (for so he Latinizes\r\nReginald Pole, after his usual fashion), and some other of his friends.\r\nOn his return, he made us laugh at y'e following. They had clomb y'e\r\nhill, and were admiring y'e prospect, when Pole, casting his eyes\r\naloft, and beginning to make sundrie gesticulations, exclaimed, \"What is\r\nit I beholde? May heaven avert y'e omen!\" with such-like exclamations,\r\nwhich raised y'e curiositie of alle. \"Don't you beholde,\" cries he,\r\n\"that enormous dragon flying through y'e sky? his horns of fire? his\r\ncurly tail?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" says Erasmus, \"nothing like it. The sky is as cleare as unwritten\r\npaper.\"\r\n\r\nHowbeit, he continued to affirme and to stare, untill at lengthe, one\r\nafter another, by dint of strayning theire eyes and theire imaginations,\r\ndid admitt, first, that they saw something; nexte, that it mighte be a\r\ndragon; and last, that it was. Of course, on theire passage homeward,\r\nthey c'd talk of little else--some made serious reflections; others,\r\nphilosophical! speculations; and Pole waggishly triumphed in having\r\nbeene y'e firste to discerne the spectacle.\r\n\r\n\"And you trulie believe there was a signe in y'e heavens?\" we inquired\r\nof Erasmus.\r\n\r\n\"What know I?\" returned he, smiling; \"you know, Constantine saw a cross.\r\nWhy shoulde Polus not see a dragon? We must judge by the event. Perhaps\r\nits mission may be to fly away with _him_. He swore to y'e curly\r\ntail.\"\r\n\r\nHow difficulte it is to discerne y'e supernatural from y'e\r\nincredible! We laughe at Gillian's faith in our Latin; Erasmus laughs at\r\nPolus his dragon. Have we a righte to believe noughte but what we can\r\nsee or prove? Nay, that will never doe. Father says a capacitie for\r\nreasoning increaseth a capacitie for believing. He believes there is\r\nsuch a thing as witchcraft, though not that poore olde Gammer Gurney is\r\na witch; he believes that saints can work miracles, though not in alle\r\ny'e marvels reported of y'e Canterbury shrine.\r\n\r\nHad I beene justice of y'e peace, like y'e king's grandmother, I\r\nw'd have beene very jealous of accusations of witchcraft; and have\r\ntaken infinite payns to sift out y'e causes of malice, jealousie, &c.,\r\nwhich mighte have wroughte with y'e poore olde women's enemies. Holie\r\nWrit sayth, \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live;\" but, questionlesse,\r\nmanie have suffered hurte that were noe witches; and for my part, I have\r\nalwaies helde ducking to be a very uncertayn as well as very cruel\r\nteste.\r\n\r\nI cannot helpe smiling, whenever I think of my rencounter with William\r\nthis morning. Mr. Gunnell had set me Homer's tiresome list of ships;\r\nand, because of y'e excessive heate within doors, I took my book into\r\ny'e nuttery, to be beyonde y'e wrath of far-darting Phoebus Apollo,\r\nwhere I clomb into my favourite filbert seat. Anon comes William through\r\ny'e trees without seeing me; and seats him at the foot of my filbert;\r\nthen, out with his tablets, and, in a posture I s'd have called\r\nstuddied, had he known anie one within sighte, falls a poetizing, I\r\nquestion not. Having noe mind to be interrupted, I lett him be, thinking\r\nhe w'd soon exhauste y'e vein; but a caterpillar dropping from y'e\r\nleaves on to my page, I was fayn for mirthe sake, to shake it down on\r\nhis tablets. As ill luck w'd have it, however, y'e little reptile\r\nonlie fell among his curls; which soe took me at vantage, that I could\r\nnot helpe hastilie crying, \"I beg your pardon.\" 'Twas worth a world to\r\nsee his start! \"What!\" cries he, looking up, \"are there indeede\r\nHamadryads?\" and would have gallanted a little, but I bade him hold down\r\nhis head, while that with a twig I switched off y'e caterpillar.\r\nNeither could forbeare laughing; and then he sued me to step downe, but\r\nI was minded to abide where I was. Howbeit, after a minute's pause, he\r\nsayd, in a grave, kind tone, \"Come, little wife;\" and taking mine arm\r\nsteadilie in his hand, I lost my balance and was faine to come down\r\nwhether or noe. We walked for some time, _juxta fluvium_; and he talked\r\nnot badlie of his travels, inasmuch as I founde there was really more in\r\nhim than one w'd think.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n--Was there ever anie-thing soe perverse, unluckie, and downright\r\ndisagreeable? We hurried our afternoone tasks, to goe on y'e water\r\nwith my father; and, meaning to give Mr. Gunnel my Latin traduction,\r\nwhich is in a book like unto this, I never knew he had my journalle\r\ninstead, untill that he burst out a laughing. \"Soe this is y'e famous\r\n_libellus_,\" quoth he,... I never waited for another word, but snatcht\r\nit out of his hand; which he, for soe strict a man, bore well enow. I do\r\nnot believe he c'd have read a dozen lines, and they were toward y'e\r\nbeginning; but I s'd hugelie like to know which dozen lines they were.\r\n\r\nHum! I have a mind never to write another word. That will be punishing\r\nmyselfe, though, insteade of Gunnel. And he bade me not take it to heart\r\nlike y'e late Bishop of Durham, to whom a like accident befel, which\r\nsoe annoyed him that he died of chagrin. I will never again, howbeit,\r\nwrite aniething savouring ever soe little of levitie or absurditie. The\r\nsaints keepe me to it! And, to know it from my exercise book, I will\r\nhenceforthe bind a blue ribbon round it. Furthermore, I will knit y'e\r\nsayd ribbon in soe close a knot, that it shall be worth noe one else's\r\npayns to pick it out. Lastlie, and for entire securitie, I will carry\r\nthe same in my pouch, which will hold bigger matters than this.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis daye, at dinner, Mr. Clement took y'e Pistoller's place at y'e\r\nreading-desk; and insteade of continuing y'e subject in hand, read a\r\nparaphrase of y'e 103rde Psalm; ye faithfullenesse and elegant turne\r\nof which, Erasmus highlie commended, though he took exceptions to y'e\r\nphrase \"renewing thy youth like that of y'e Phoenix,\" whose fabulous\r\nstory he believed to have been unknown to y'e Psalmist, and,\r\ntherefore, however poeticall, was unfitt to be introduced. A deepe blush\r\non sweet Mercy's face ledd to y'e detection of y'e paraphrast, and\r\ndrew on her some deserved commendations. Erasmus, turning to my father,\r\nexclaymed with animation, \"I woulde call this house the academy of\r\nPlato, were it not injustice to compare it to a place where the usuall\r\ndisputations concerning figures and numbers were onlie oocasionallie\r\nintersperst with disquisitions concerning y'e moral virtues.\" Then, in\r\na graver mood, he added, \"One mighte envie you, but that your precious\r\nprivileges are bound up with soe paynfulle anxieties. How manie pledges\r\nhave you given to fortune!\"\r\n\r\n\"If my children are to die out of y'e course of nature, before theire\r\nparents,\" father firmly replyed, \"I w'd rather they died\r\nwell-instructed than ignorant.\"\r\n\r\n\"You remind me,\" rejoyns Erasmus, \"of Phocion; whose wife, when he was\r\naboute to drink y'e fatal cup, exclaimed, 'Ah, my husband! you die\r\ninnocent.' 'And woulde you, my wife,' he returned, 'have me die\r\nguilty?'\"\r\n\r\nAwhile after, Gonellus askt leave to see Erasmus his signet-ring, which\r\nhe handed down to him. In passing it back, William, who was occupyde in\r\ncarving a crane, handed it soe negligentlie that it felle to y'e\r\nground. I never saw such a face as Erasmus made, when 'twas picked out\r\nfrom y'e rushes! And yet, ours are renewed almoste daylie, which manie\r\nthink over nice. He took it gingerlie in his faire, womanlike hands, and\r\nwashed and wiped it before he put it on; which escaped not my\r\nstep-mother's displeased notice. Indeede, these Dutchmen are\r\nscrupulouslie cleane, though mother calls 'em swinish, because they will\r\neat raw sallets; though, for that matter, father loves cresses and\r\nramps. She alsoe mislikes Erasmus for eating cheese and butter together\r\nwith his manchet; or what he calls _boetram_; and for being, generallie,\r\ndaintie at his sizes, which she sayth is an ill example to soe manie\r\nyoung people, and becometh not one with soe little money in's purse:\r\nhowbeit, I think 'tis not nicetie, but a weak stomach, which makes him\r\nloathe our salt-meat commons from Michaelmasse to Easter, and eschew\r\nfish of y'e coarser sort. He cannot breakfaste on colde milk like\r\nfather, but liketh furmity a little spiced. At dinner, he pecks at,\r\nrather than eats, ruffs and reeves, lapwings, or anie smalle birds it\r\nmay chance; but affects sweets and subtilties, and loves a cup of wine\r\nor ale, stirred with rosemary. Father never toucheth the wine-cup but to\r\ngrace a guest, and loves water from the spring. We growing girls eat\r\nmore than either; and father says he loves to see us slice away at the\r\ncob-loaf; it does him goode. What a kind father he is! I wish my\r\nstep-mother were as kind. I hate alle sneaping and snubbing, flowting,\r\nfleering, pinching, nipping, and such-like; it onlie creates resentment\r\ninsteade of penitence, and lowers y'e minde of either partie. Gillian\r\nthrows a rolling-pin at y'e turnspit's head, and we call it low-life;\r\nbut we looke for such unmannerlinesse in the kitchen. A whip is onlie\r\nfit for Tisiphone.\r\n\r\nAs we rose from table, I noted Argus pearcht on y'e window-sill,\r\neagerlie watching for his dinner, which he looketh for as punctuallie as\r\nif he c'd tell the diall; and to please the good, patient bird, till\r\nthe scullion broughte him his mess of garden-stuff, I fetched him some\r\npulse, which he took from mine hand, taking good heede not to hurt me\r\nwith his sharp beak. While I was feeding him, Erasmus came up, and asked\r\nme concerning Mercy Giggs; and I tolde him how that she was a\r\nfriendlesse orphan, to whom deare father afforded protection and the run\r\nof y'e house; and tolde him of her gratitude, her meekness, her\r\npatience, her docilitie, her aptitude for alle goode works and\r\nalms-deeds; and how, in her little chamber, she improved eache spare\r\nmoment in y'e way of studdy and prayer. He repeated \"Friendlesse? she\r\ncannot be called friendlesse, who hath More for her protector, and his\r\nchildren for companions;' and then woulde heare more of her parents' sad\r\nstory. Alsoe, would hear somewhat of Rupert Allington, and how father\r\ngained his law-suit. Alsoe, of Daisy, whose name he tooke to be y'e\r\ntrue abbreviation for Margaret, but I tolde him how that my step-sister,\r\nand Mercy, and I, being all three of a name, and I being alwaies called\r\nMeg, we had in sport given one the significative of her characteristic\r\nvirtue, and the other that of y'e French Marguerite, which may indeed\r\nbe rendered either pearl or daisy. And Chaucer, speaking of our English\r\ndaisy, saith\r\n\r\n    \"Si douce est la Marguerite.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSince y'e little wisdom I have capacitie to acquire, soe oft gives me\r\ny'e headache to distraction, I marvel not at Jupiter's payn in his\r\nhead, when the goddess of wisdom sprang therefrom full growne.\r\n\r\nThis morn, to quiet y'e payn brought on by too busie application, Mr.\r\nGunnell would have me close my book and ramble forth with Cecy into\r\ny'e fields. We strolled towards Walham Greene; and she was seeking for\r\nshepherd's purses and shepherd's needles, when she came running back to\r\nme, looking rather pale. I askt what had scared her, and she made answer\r\nthat Gammer Gurney was coming along y'e hedge. I bade her set aside\r\nher fears; and anon we come up with Gammer, who was puling at y'e\r\npurple blossoms of y'e deadly night-shade. I sayd, \"Gammer, to what\r\npurpose gather that weed? knowest not 'tis evill?\"\r\n\r\nShe sayth, mumbling, \"What God hath created, that call not thou evill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but,\" quo' I, \"'tis poison.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, and medicine, too,\" returns Gammer, \"I wonder what we poor souls\r\nmight come to, if we tooke nowt for our ails and aches but what we could\r\nbuy o' the potticary. We've got noe Dr. Clement, we poor folks, to be\r\nour leech o' the household.\"\r\n\r\n\"But hast no feare,\" quo' I, \"of an overdose?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's manie a doctor,\" sayth she, with an unpleasant leer, \"that hath\r\ngiven that at first. In time he gets his hand in; and I've had a plenty\r\no' practice--thanks to self and sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew not,\" quoth I, \"that thou hadst a sister.\"\r\n\r\n\"How should ye, mistress,\" returns she, shortlie, \"when ye never comes\r\nnigh us? We've grubbed on together this many a year.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis soe far,\" I returned, half ashamed.\r\n\r\n\"Why, soe it be,\" answers Gammer; \"far from neighbours, far from church,\r\nand far from priest; howbeit, my old legs carries me to _your_ house o'\r\nFridays; but I know not whether I shall e'er come agayn--the rye bread\r\nwas soe hard last time; it may serve for young teeth, and for them as\r\nhas got none; but mine, you see, are onlie on the _goe_;\" and she opened\r\nher mouth with a ghastly smile. \"'Tis not,\" she added, \"that I'm\r\nungratefulle; but thou sees, mistress, I really _can't_ eat crusts.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, I asked, \"Where lies your dwelling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Out by yonder,\" quoth she, pointing to a shapeless mass like a huge\r\nbird's nest in y'e corner of the field. \"There bides poor Joan and I.\r\nWilt come and looke within, mistress, and see how a Christian can die?\"\r\n\r\nI mutelie complyed, in spite of Cecy's pulling at my skirts. Arrived at\r\ny'e wretched abode, which had a hole for its chimney, and another for\r\ndoor at once and window, I found, sitting in a corner, propped on a heap\r\nof rushes, dried leaves, and olde rags, an aged sick woman, who seemed\r\nto have but a little while to live. A mug of water stoode within her\r\nreach; I saw none other sustenance; but, in her visage, oh, such\r\npeace!... Whispers Gammer with an awfulle look, \"She sees 'em now!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sees who?\" quoth I.\r\n\r\n\"Why, angels in two long rows, afore y'e throne of God, a bending of\r\nthemselves, this way, with theire faces to th' earth, and arms stretched\r\nout afore 'em.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hath she seen a priest?\" quoth I.\r\n\r\n\"Lord love ye,\" returns Gammer, \"what coulde a priest doe for her? She's\r\nis in heaven alreadie. I doubte if she can heare me.\" And then, in a\r\nloud, distinct voyce, quite free from her usuall mumping, she beganne to\r\nrecite in _English_, \"Blessed is every one that feareth y'e Lord, and\r\nwalketh in his ways,\" etc.; which y'e dying woman hearde, although\r\nalreadie speechlesse; and reaching out her feeble arm unto her sister's\r\nneck, she dragged it down till their faces touched; and then, looking\r\nup, pointed at somewhat she aimed to make her see ... and we alle looked\r\nup, but saw noughte. Howbeit, she pointed up three severall times, and\r\nlay, as it were, transfigured before us, a gazing at some transporting\r\nsighte, and ever and anon turning on her sister looks of love; and, the\r\nwhile we stoode thus agaze, her spiritt passed away without even a\r\nthrill or a shudder. Cecy and I beganne to weepe; and, after a while,\r\nsoe did Gammer; then, putting us forthe, she sayd, \"Goe, children, goe;\r\n'tis noe goode crying; and yet I'm thankfulle to ye for your teares.\"\r\n\r\nI sayd, \"Is there aught we can doe for thee?\"\r\n\r\nShe made answer, \"Perhaps you can give me tuppence, mistress, to lay on\r\nher poor eyelids and keep 'em down. Bless 'ee, bless 'ee! You're like\r\ny'e good Samaritan--he pulled out two-pence. And maybe, if I come to\r\n'ee to-morrow, you'll give me a lapfulle of rosemarie, to lay on her\r\npoor corpse.... I know you've plenty. God be with 'ee, children; and be\r\nsure ye mind how a Christian can die.\"\r\n\r\nSoe we left, and came home sober enow. Cecy sayth, \"To die is not soe\r\nfearfulle, Meg, as I thoughte, but shoulde _you_ fancy dying without a\r\npriest? I shoulde not; and yet Gammer sayd she wanted not one. Howbeit,\r\nfor certayn, Gammer Gurney is noe witch, or she woulde not so prayse\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nTo conclude, father, on hearing alle, hath given Gammer more than enow\r\nfor her present needes; and Cecy and I are y'e almoners of his mercy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                June 24.\r\n\r\nYesternighte, being St. John's Eve, we went into town to see y'e\r\nmustering of y'e watch. Mr. Rastall had secured us a window opposite\r\ny'e King's Head, in Chepe, where theire M'ys. went in state to see\r\nthe show. The streets were a marvell to see, being like unto a\r\ncontinuation of fayr bowres or arbours, garlanded acrosse and over y'e\r\ndoors with greene birch, long fennel, orpin, St. John's wort, white\r\nlilies, and such like; with innumerable candles intersperst, the which,\r\nbeing lit up as soon as 'twas dusk, made the whole look like enchanted\r\nland; while at y'e same time, the leaping over bon-fires commenced,\r\nand produced shouts of laughter. The youths woulde have father goe downe\r\nand joyn 'em; Rupert, speciallie, begged him hard, but he put him off\r\nwith, \"Sirrah, you goosecap, dost think 'twoulde befitt y'e Judge of\r\nthe Sheriffs' Court?\"\r\n\r\nAt length, to y'e sound of trumpets, came marching up Cheapside two\r\nthousand of the watch, in white fustian, with the City badge; and seven\r\nhundred cressett bearers, eache with his fellow to supplie him with oyl,\r\nand making, with theire flaring lights, the night as cleare as daye.\r\nAfter 'em, the morris-dancers and City waites; the Lord Mayor on\r\nhorseback, very fine, with his giants and pageants: and the Sheriff and\r\nhis watch, and _his_ giants and pageants. The streets very uproarious on\r\nour way back to the barge, but the homeward passage delicious; the\r\nnighte ayre cool; and the stars shining brightly. Father and Erasmus had\r\nsome astronomick talk; howbeit, methoughte Erasmus less familiar with\r\ny'e heavenlie bodies than father is. Afterwards, they spake of y'e\r\nKing, but not over-freelie, by reason of y'e bargemen overhearing.\r\nThence, to y'e ever-vext question of Martin Luther, of whome Erasmus\r\nspake in terms of earneste, yet qualifyde prayse.\r\n\r\n\"If Luther be innocent,\" quoth he, \"I woulde not run him down by a\r\nwicked faction; if he be in error, I woulde rather have him reclaymed\r\nthan destroyed; for this is most agreeable to the doctrine of our deare\r\nLord and Master, who woulde not bruise y'e broken reede, nor quenche\r\ny'e smoaking flax.\" And much more to same purpose.\r\n\r\nWe younger folks felle to choosing our favourite mottoes and devices, in\r\nwhich y'e elders at length joyned us. Mother's was loyal--\"Cleave to\r\ny'e crown though it hang on a bush.\" Erasmus's pithie--\"Festina\r\nlente.\" William sayd he was indebted for his to St. Paul--\"I seeke not\r\nyours, but you.\" For me, I quoted one I had seene in an olde countrie\r\nchurch, \"Mieux être que paroitre,\" which pleased father and Erasmus\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPoor Erasmus caughte colde on y'e water last nighte, and keeps house\r\nto-daye, taking warm possets. 'Tis my week of housekeeping under\r\nmother's guidance, and I never had more pleasure in it: delighting to\r\nsuit his taste in sweete things, which, methinks, all men like. I have\r\nenow of time left for studdy, when alle's done.\r\n\r\nHe hathe beene the best part of the morning in our academia, looking\r\nover books and manuscripts, taking notes of some, discoursing with Mr.\r\nGunnell and others; and, in some sorte, interrupting our morning's work;\r\nbut how pleasantlie! Besides, as father sayth, \"varietie is not always\r\ninterruption. That which occasionallie lets and hinders our accustomed\r\nstuddies, may prove to y'e ingenious noe less profitable than theire\r\nstuddies themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThey beganne with discussing y'e pronunciation of Latin and Greek, on\r\nwhich Erasmus differeth much from us, though he holds to our\r\npronunciation of y'e _theta_. Thence, to y'e absurde partie of the\r\nCiceronians now in Italie, who will admit noe author save Tully to be\r\nread nor quoted, nor anie word not in his writings to be used. Thence,\r\nto y'e Latinitie of y'e Fathers, of whose style he spake slightlie\r\nenow, but rated Jerome above Augustine. At length, to his Greek and\r\nLatin Testament, of late issued from y'e presse, and y'e incredible\r\nlabour it hath cost him to make it as perfect as possible: on this\r\nsubject he soe warmed, that Bess and I listened with suspended breath.\r\n\"May it please God,\" sayth he, knitting ferventlie his hands, \"to make\r\nit a blessing to all Christendom! I look for noe other reward. Scholars\r\nand believers yet unborn, may have reason to thank, and yet may forget\r\nErasmus.\" He then went on to explain to Gunnell what he had much felt in\r\nwant of, and hoped some scholar might yet undertake; to wit, a sort of\r\nIndex Bibliorum, showing in how manie passages of holy writ occurreth\r\nanie given word, etc.; and he e'en proposed it to Gunnell, saying 'twas\r\nonlie y'e work of patience and industry, and mighte be layd aside, and\r\nresumed as occasion offered, and completed at leisure, to y'e great\r\nthankfullenesse of scholars. But Gunnell onlie smiled and shooke his\r\nhead. Howbeit, Erasmus set forth his scheme soe playnlie, that I, having\r\na pen in hand, did privilie note down alle y'e heads of y'e same,\r\nthinking, if none else w'd undertake it, why s'd not I? since\r\nleisure and industrie were alone required, and since 'twoulde be soe\r\nacceptable to manie, 'speciallie to Erasmus.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Continued from the April Number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STOLEN FRUIT.--A STORY OF NAPOLEON'S CHILDHOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of August, 1777, two little girls of seven or eight years\r\nold were playing in a garden near Ajaccio in Corsica. After running up\r\nand down among the trees and flowers, one of them stopped the other at\r\nthe entrance to a dark grotto under a rock.\r\n\r\n\"Eliza,\" she said, \"don't go any further: it frightens me to look into\r\nthat black cave.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense! 'Tis only Napoleon's Grotto.\"\r\n\r\n\"This garden belongs to your uncle Fesch: has he given this dark hole to\r\nNapoleon?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Panoria; my great-uncle has not given him this grotto. But as he\r\noften comes and spends hours in it by himself, we all call it\r\n_Napoleon's Grotto_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what can he be doing there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Talking to himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't know: a variety of things. But come, help me to gather a\r\nlarge bunch of flowers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just now, when we were on the lower walk, you told me not to pull any,\r\nalthough there was abundance of sweet ones.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but that was in my uncle the canon's garden.\r\n\r\n\"And are his flowers more sacred than those of uncle Fesch?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are indeed, Panoria.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't know, but when any one wants to prevent our playing,\r\nthey say, 'That will give your uncle the canon a headache!' When we are\r\nnot to touch something, 'tis always, 'That belongs to the canon!' If we\r\nwant to eat some fine fruit, 'Don't touch that; 'tis for your uncle the\r\ncanon!' And even when we are praised or rewarded, 'tis always because\r\nthe canon is pleased with us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it because he is archdeacon of Ajaccio that people are so much\r\nafraid of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, Panoria; but because he is our tutor. Papa is not rich enough\r\nto pay for masters to teach us, and he has not time to look after our\r\neducation himself; so our uncle the canon teaches us every thing. He is\r\nnot unkind, but he is very strict. If we don't know our lessons, he\r\nslaps us smartly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And don't you call that unkind, Eliza?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly. Do you never get a whipping yourself, Panoria?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed, Eliza. It is the Corsican fashion to beat children; but our\r\nfamily is Greek, and mamma says Greeks must not be beaten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'm sure, Panoria, I wish I were a Greek; for 'tis very unpleasant\r\nto be slapped!\"\r\n\r\n\"I dare say your brother Napoleon does not like it either.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is the only one of my brothers who does not cry or complain when he\r\nis punished. If you heard what a noise Joseph and Lucien make, you would\r\nfancy that uncle was flaying them alive!\"\r\n\r\n\"But about Napoleon. What can he be talking about alone in the grotto?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! Here he is! Let us hide ourselves behind this lilac-tree, and\r\nyou'll hear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see Severia coming to call us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! it will take her an hour to gather ripe fruit for uncle the canon.\r\nWe shall have time enough. Come!\"\r\n\r\nAnd the little girls, gliding between the rock and the overhanging\r\nshrubs, took up their position in perfect concealment.\r\n\r\nThe boy who advanced toward the grotto differed from the generality of\r\nchildren of his age in the size of his head, the massive form of his\r\nnoble brow, and the fixed _examining_ expression of his eyes. He walked\r\nslowly--looking at the bright blue sea--and unconscious that his\r\nproceedings were closely watched by two pair of little bright black\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\"Here I am my own master!\" he said as he entered the grotto. \"No one\r\ncommands me here!\" And seating himself royally on a bench within the\r\ndark entrance, he continued, \"This is my birthday. I am eight years old\r\nto-day. I wish I lived among the Spartans, then I should be beyond the\r\ncontrol of women; but now I have to obey such a number of people--old\r\nSeveria among the rest. Ah, if I were the master!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and if you were the master, what would you do?\" cried Eliza,\r\nthrusting forward her pretty little head.\r\n\r\n\"First of all, I'd teach you not to come listening at doors,\" replied\r\nNapoleon, disconcerted at being overheard.\r\n\r\n\"But, brother, there's no door that I can see.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter, you have been eaves-dropping all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eliza!--Panoria!\" cried a loud voice. \"Where can these children have\r\ngone to?\"\r\n\r\nThe young ladies came out of their leafy lurking-place in time to meet\r\nthe little Bonapartes' nurse, Severia--a tall old woman, who carried on\r\nher arm a basket filled with the most luscious tempting pears, grapes,\r\nand figs.\r\n\r\n\"A pear, Severia!\" cried Napoleon, darting forward, and thrusting his\r\nhand into the basket.\r\n\r\n\"The saints forbid, child!\" exclaimed Severia. \"They are for your uncle\r\nthe canon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Napoleon, drawing back his hand as quickly as if a wasp had\r\nstung him.\r\n\r\nPanoria burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I never saw such people!\" she said, as soon as her mirth allowed her to\r\nspeak. \"My uncle the canon seems the bugbear of the whole family. Is\r\nSeveria afraid of him, too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more than I am,\" said Napoleon, boldly.\r\n\r\n\"And yet you were afraid to take a pear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I did not wish to do it, Panoria.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did not _dare_ do it, Napoleon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did not _wish_ to do it, Panoria.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if you wished it, would you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I would.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you are a boaster, Napoleon; and in your uncle's presence would\r\nbe just as great a coward as Eliza or Pauline?\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, children, follow me,\" said Severia, walking on.\r\n\r\n\"You think I am a coward?\" whispered Eliza to her little friend. \"Come\r\ninto the house, and see if I don't eat as much of uncle's fruit as I\r\nplease. Mamma is gone out to pay a visit, and will not be home until\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll help you,\" said Panoria. And the little girls, fixing their\r\nwistful eyes on the tempting fruit, followed Severia to the house.\r\n\r\nNapoleon remained some time longer in his grotto; and when supper-time\r\napproached, he went into the house. Feeling very thirsty, he entered\r\nthe dining-room, in which was a large cupboard, where fresh water was\r\nusually kept. Just as he was going in, he heard a noise: the cupboard\r\ndoors were quickly shut, and he caught a glimpse of a white frock\r\ndisappearing through the open window. Instead, however, of looking after\r\nthe fugitive, he went quietly to get a glass of water in the cupboard.\r\nThen, to his dismay, he saw his uncle's basket of fruit half empty!\r\nWhile, forgetting his thirst, he looked with astonishment at the fruit,\r\nconsidering who could have been the hardy thief, a voice behind him\r\nroused him from his reverie.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing there, Napoleon? You know you are not permitted to\r\nhelp yourself to supper.\"\r\n\r\nThis was uncle the canon himself--a short, stout old man with a bald\r\nhead, whose otherwise ordinary features were lighted up with the eagle\r\nglance which afterward distinguished his grand-nephew.\r\n\r\n\"I was not taking any thing, uncle,\" replied Napoleon. And then suddenly\r\nthe idea occurring to him that he might be accused of having taken the\r\nfruit, the blood rushed hotly to his cheeks.\r\n\r\nHis confusion was so evident, that the canon said, \"I hope you are not\r\ntelling a falsehood, Napoleon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never tell falsehoods,\" said the boy, proudly.\r\n\r\n\"What were you doing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thirsty; I came to get some water.\"\r\n\r\n\"No harm in that--and then, my boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"That was all, uncle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you drunk the water?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, uncle; not yet.\"\r\n\r\nThe archdeacon shook his head. \"You came to drink, and you did not\r\ndrink; that does not hang well together. Napoleon, take care. If you\r\nfrankly confess your fault, whatever it may be, you shall be forgiven;\r\nbut if you tell a lie, and persist in it, I warn you that I shall punish\r\nyou severely.\"\r\n\r\nThe entrance of M. Bonaparte, M. Fesch, and Joseph, Napoleon's eldest\r\nbrother, interrupted the conversation; and for some minutes the elder\r\ngentlemen spoke to each other on political subjects; when a sudden\r\nexclamation from Severia, as she opened the cupboard, attracted the\r\nattention of all.\r\n\r\n\"Santa Madona! who has taken the fruit?\"\r\n\r\n\"This is the mystery discovered!\" said the canon, turning toward\r\nNapoleon. \"So you stole the fruit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I never touched it,\" replied the boy.\r\n\r\n\"Call in the other children,\" said the archdeacon.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes five beautiful children, three boys and two girls,\r\nformed a group round their father, who, looking at each one in turn,\r\nasked, \"Which of you has taken the fruit that was gathered in your uncle\r\nthe canon's garden?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not!\" \"Nor I!\" \"Nor I!\" cried they all. But Eliza's voice was\r\nlower and less assured than those of the others.\r\n\r\n\"And you, Napoleon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have said, papa, that I did not do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a falsehood!\" exclaimed Severia, who, being an old domestic,\r\ntook great liberties.\r\n\r\n\"If you were not a woman!\" said Napoleon, shaking his small clenched\r\nhand at her.\r\n\r\n\"Silence! Napoleon,\" said his father, sternly.\r\n\r\n\"It must have been you, Napoleon,\" said Severia; \"for after putting the\r\nfruit into the cupboard, I never left the ante-room, and not a soul\r\npassed through except the archdeacon and yourself. If he has not taken\r\nthem--\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish truly I had,\" said the old gentleman, \"and then I should not\r\nhave the grief of seeing one of my children persist in a lie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Uncle, I am not guilty,\" repeated Napoleon firmly.\r\n\r\n\"Do not be obstinate, but confess,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" added the canon; \"'tis the only way to escape punishment.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I never touched the fruit--indeed, I did not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Napoleon,\" said his uncle, \"I can not believe you. I shall give you\r\nfive minutes; and if, at the end of that time, you do not confess, and\r\nask for pardon, I shall whip you.\"\r\n\r\n\"A whip is for horses and dogs, not for children!\" said the boy.\r\n\r\n\"A whip is for disobedient, lying children,\" replied his father.\r\n\r\n\"Then 'tis unjust to give it me, for I am neither a liar nor\r\ndisobedient.\" So saying, Napoleon crossed his arms on his chest, and\r\nsettled himself in a firm attitude.\r\n\r\nMeantime his brothers and his sister Pauline came close to him, and\r\nwhispered good-natured entreaties that he would confess.\r\n\r\n\"But how can I, when I have not done wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"So you are still obstinate?\" said his uncle. And taking him by the arm,\r\nhe led him into the next room. Presently the sound of sharp repeated\r\nblows was heard, but not a cry or complaint from the little sufferer.\r\n\r\nMadame Bonaparte was away from home, and in the evening her husband went\r\nto meet her, accompanied by Joseph, Lucien, and Eliza. M. Fesch and the\r\ncanon were also about to depart, and in passing through the ante-room,\r\nthey saw Napoleon standing, pale and grave, but proud, and firm-looking\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n\"Well, my child,\" said his father, \"I hope you will now ask your uncle's\r\npardon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not touch the fruit, papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still obstinate! As the rod will not do, I shall try another method.\r\nYour mother, brothers, Eliza, and I, will be away for three days, and\r\nduring that time you shall have nothing but bread and water, unless you\r\nask your uncle's forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, papa, won't you let him have some cheese with his bread?\"\r\nwhispered little Pauline.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but not _broccio_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah do, papa, please let him have _broccio_ 'tis the nicest cheese in\r\nCorsica!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the reason he does not deserve it,\" said his father, looking at\r\nthe boy with an anxious expression, as if he hoped to see some sign of\r\npenitence on his face. But none such appearing, he proceeded toward the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nJoseph and Lucien took a kind leave of their brother, but Eliza seemed\r\nunwilling and afraid to go near or look at him.\r\n\r\nThe three days passed on, heavily enough for poor Napoleon, who was in\r\ndisgrace, and living on bread, water, and cheese, which was not\r\n_broccio_. At length the party returned, and little Panoria, who was\r\nwatching for her friend Eliza, came with them into the house.\r\n\r\n\"Good-morning, uncle,\" said Madame Bonaparte to the archdeacon, \"how are\r\nyou? And where are Napoleon and Pauline?\"\r\n\r\n\"Here I am, mamma,\" said the latter throwing her arms around her\r\nmother's neck.\r\n\r\n\"And Napoleon?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is here,\" said the canon.\r\n\r\n\"Has he confessed?\" asked his father.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the uncle. \"I never before witnessed such obstinacy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What has he done?\" asked his mother.\r\n\r\nThe canon, in reply, related the story of the fruit; but before he could\r\nfinish it, Panoria exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Of course, poor fellow, he would not confess what he never did!\"\r\n\r\n\"And who did take the fruit?\" asked the canon.\r\n\r\n\"I and Eliza,\" replied the little girl without hesitation.\r\n\r\nThere was a universal exclamation.\r\n\r\n\"My poor child,\" said the archdeacon, embracing Napoleon tenderly, \"why\r\ndid you not undeceive us?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suspected it was Eliza,\" replied Napoleon; \"but I was not sure. At\r\nall events, I would not have told, for Panoria's sake, who is not a\r\nliar.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader may imagine how Napoleon was caressed and rewarded to make\r\nhim amends for the pain he had unjustly suffered. As to Eliza, she was\r\nseverely and rightly punished: first for her gluttony; and then for what\r\nwas much worse--her cowardice and deceit in allowing her innocent\r\nbrother to suffer for her fault.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILBERFORCE AND CHALMERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have seldom observed a more amusing and pleasing contrast between two\r\ngreat men than between Wilberforce and Chalmers. Chalmers is stout and\r\nerect, with a broad countenance--Wilberforce minute, and singularly\r\ntwisted: Chalmers, both in body and mind, moves with, a deliberate\r\nstep--Wilberforce, infirm as he is in his advanced years, flies about\r\nwith astonishing activity, and while, with nimble finger, he seizes on\r\nevery thing that adorns or diversifies his path, his mind flits from\r\nobject to object with unceasing versatility. I often think that\r\nparticular men bear about with them an analogy to particular animals:\r\nChalmers is like a good-tempered lion--Wilberforce is like a bee:\r\nChalmers can say a pleasant thing now and then, and laugh when he has\r\nsaid it, and he has a strong touch of humor in his countenance, but in\r\ngeneral he is _grave_, his thoughts grow to a great size before they are\r\nuttered--Wilberforce sparkles with life and wit, and the characteristic\r\nof his mind is \"rapid productiveness.\" A man might be in Chalmers's\r\ncompany for an hour, especially in a party, without knowing who or what\r\nhe was--though in the end he would be sure to be detected by some\r\nunexpected display of powerful originality. Wilberforce, except when\r\nfairly asleep, is never latent. Chalmers knows how to vail himself in a\r\ndecent cloud--Wilberforce is always in sunshine. Seldom, I believe, has\r\nany mind been more strung to a perpetual tune of love and praise. Yet\r\nthese persons, distinguished as they are from the world at large, and\r\nfrom each other, present some admirable points of resemblance. Both of\r\nthem are broad thinkers, and liberal feelers; both of them are arrayed\r\nin humility, meekness, and charity: both appear to hold self in little\r\nreputation: above all, both love the Lord Jesus Christ, and reverently\r\nacknowledge him to be their _only Saviour_.--_Hanna's Memoirs of\r\nChalmers._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL; OR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.\r\n\r\n(_Continued from page 698._)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMr. Dale had been more than a quarter of an hour conversing with Mrs.\r\nAvenel, and had seemingly made little progress in the object of his\r\ndiplomatic mission, for now, slowly drawing on his gloves, he said,\r\n\r\n\"I grieve to think, Mrs. Avenel, that you should have so hardened your\r\nheart--yes--you must pardon me--it is my vocation to speak stern truths.\r\nYou can not say that I have not kept faith with you, but I must now\r\ninvite you to remember that I specially reserved to myself the right of\r\nexercising a discretion to act as I judged best, for the child's\r\ninterests, on any future occasion; and it was upon this understanding\r\nthat you gave me the promise, which you would now evade, of providing\r\nfor him when he came into manhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I say I will provide for him. I say that you may 'prentice him in any\r\ndistant town, and by-and-by we will stock a shop for him. What would you\r\nhave more, sir, from folks like us, who have kept shop ourselves? It\r\nain't reasonable what you ask, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear friend,\" said the Parson, \"what I ask of you at present is but\r\nto see him--to receive him kindly--to listen to his conversation--to\r\njudge for yourselves. We can have but a common object--that your\r\ngrandson should succeed in life, and do you credit. Now, I doubt very\r\nmuch whether we can effect this by making him a small shopkeeper.\"\r\n\r\n\"And has Jane Fairfield, who married a common carpenter, brought him up\r\nto despise small shopkeepers?\" exclaimed Mrs. Avenel, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Heaven forbid! Some of the first men in England have been the sons of\r\nsmall shopkeepers. But is it a crime in them, or their parents, if their\r\ntalents have lifted them into such rank or renown as the haughtiest duke\r\nmight envy? England were not England if a man must rest where his father\r\nbegan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said, or rather grunted, an approving voice, but neither Mrs.\r\nAvenel nor the Parson heard it.\r\n\r\n\"All very fine,\" said Mrs. Avenel, bluntly. \"But to send a boy like that\r\nto the university--where's the money to come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mrs. Avenel,\" said the Parson, coaxingly, \"the cost need not be\r\ngreat at a small college at Cambridge; and if you will pay half the\r\nexpense, I will pay the other half. I have no children of my own, and\r\ncan afford it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very handsome in you, sir,\" said Mrs. Avenel, somewhat touched,\r\nyet still not graciously. \"But the money is not the only point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Once at Cambridge,\" continued Mr. Dale, speaking rapidly, \"at\r\nCambridge, where the studies are mathematical--that is, of a nature for\r\nwhich he has shown so great an aptitude--and I have no doubt he will\r\ndistinguish himself; if he does, he will obtain, on leaving, what is\r\ncalled a fellowship--that is a collegiate dignity accompanied by an\r\nincome on which he could maintain himself until he made his way in life.\r\nCome, Mrs. Avenel, you are well off; you have no relations nearer to you\r\nin want of your aid. Your son, I hear, has been very fortunate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Mrs. Avenel, interrupting the Parson, \"it is not because my\r\nson Richard is an honor to us, and is a good son, and has made his\r\nfortin, that we are to rob him of what we have to leave, and give it to\r\na boy whom we know nothing about, and who, in spite of what you say,\r\ncan't bring upon us any credit at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why? I don' see that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" exclaimed Mrs. Avenel, fiercely--\"why? you know why. No, I don't\r\nwant him to rise in life: I don't want folks to be speiring and asking\r\nabout him. I think it is a very wicked thing to have put fine notions in\r\nhis head, and I am sure my daughter Fairfield could not have done it\r\nherself. And now, to ask me to rob Richard, and bring out a great\r\nboy--who's been a gardener, or plowman, or such like--to disgrace a\r\ngentleman who keeps his carriage, as my son Richard does--I would have\r\nyou to know, sir, no! I won't do it, and there's an end to the matter.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the last two or three minutes, and just before that approving\r\n\"good\" had responded to the Parson's popular sentiment, a door\r\ncommunicating with an inner room had been gently opened, and stood ajar;\r\nbut this incident neither party had even noticed. But now the door was\r\nthrown boldly open, and the traveler whom the Parson had met at the inn\r\nwalked up to Mr. Dale, and said, \"No! that's not the end of the matter.\r\nYou say the boy's a 'cute clever lad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Richard, have you been listening?\" exclaimed Mrs. Avenel.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess, yes--the last few minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what have you heard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that this reverend gentleman thinks so highly of my sister\r\nFairfield's boy that he offers to pay half of his keep at college. Sir,\r\nI'm very much obliged to you, and there's my hand, if you'll take it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson jumped up, overjoyed, and, with a triumphant glance toward\r\nMrs. Avenel, shook hands heartily with Mr. Richard.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the latter, \"just put on your hat, sir, and take a stroll\r\nwith me, and we'll discuss the thing business-like. Women don't\r\nunderstand business; never talk to women on business.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, Mr. Richard drew out a cigar-case, selected a cigar,\r\nwhich he applied to the candle, and walked into the hall.\r\n\r\nMrs. Avenel caught hold of the Parson. \"Sir, you'll be on your guard\r\nwith Richard. Remember your promise.\"\r\n\r\n\"He does not know all, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He? No! And you see he did not overhear more than what he says. I'm\r\nsure you're a gentleman, and won't go agin your word.\"\r\n\r\n\"My word was conditional; but I will promise you never to break the\r\nsilence without more reason than I think there is here for it. Indeed,\r\nMr. Richard Avenel seems to save all necessity for that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you coming, sir?\" cried Richard, as he opened the street door.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nThe Parson joined Mr. Richard Avenel on the road. It was a fine night,\r\nand the moon clear and shining.\r\n\r\n\"So, then,\" said Mr. Richard thoughtfully, \"poor Jane, who was always\r\nthe drudge of the family, has contrived to bring up her son well; and\r\nthe boy is really what you say, eh?--could make a figure at college?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure of it,\" said the Parson, hooking himself on to the arm which\r\nMr. Avenel proffered.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to see him,\" said Richard. \"Has he any manner? Is he\r\ngenteel? or a mere country lout?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed he speaks with so much propriety, and has so much modest\r\ndignity, I might say, about him, that there's many a rich gentleman who\r\nwould be proud of such a son.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is odd,\" observed Richard, \"what difference there is in families.\r\nThere's Jane now--who can't read nor write, and was just fit to be a\r\nworkman's wife--had not a thought above her station; and when I think of\r\nmy poor sister Nora--you would not believe it, sir, but _she_ was the\r\nmost elegant creature in the world--yes, even as a child (she was but a\r\nchild when I went off to America). And often, as I was getting on in\r\nlife, often I used to say to myself, 'My little Nora shall be a lady\r\nafter all.' Poor thing--but she died young.\"\r\n\r\nRichard's voice grew husky.\r\n\r\nThe Parson kindly pressed the arm on which he leaned, and said, after a\r\npause,\r\n\r\n\"Nothing refines us like education, sir. I believe your sister Nora had\r\nreceived much instruction, and had the talents to profit by it; it is\r\nthe same with your nephew.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll see him,\" said Richard, stamping his foot firmly on the ground,\r\n\"and if I like him, I'll be as good as a father to him. Look you, Mr.\r\n---- what's your name, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dale.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dale, look you, I'm a single man. Perhaps I may marry some day;\r\nperhaps I shan't. I'm not going to throw myself away. If I can get a\r\nlady of quality, why--but that's neither here nor there; meanwhile, I\r\nshould be glad of a nephew whom I need not be ashamed of. You see, sir,\r\nI'm a new man, the builder of my own fortunes; and, though I have picked\r\nup a little education--I don't well know how--as I scrambled on, still,\r\nnow I come back to the old country I'm well aware that I am not exactly\r\na match for those d----d aristocrats; don't show so well in a\r\ndrawing-room as I could wish. I could be a Parliament man if I liked,\r\nbut I might make a goose of myself; so, all things considered, if I can\r\nget a sort of junior partner to do the polite work, and show off the\r\ngoods, I think the house of Avenel & Co. might become a pretty\r\nconsiderable honor to the Britishers. You understand me, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well,\" answered Mr. Dale smiling, though rather gravely.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued the New Man, \"I'm not ashamed to have risen in life by\r\nmy own merits; and I don't disguise what I've been. And, when I'm in my\r\nown grand house, I'm fond of saying, 'I landed at New York with £10 in\r\nmy purse, and here I am!' But it would not do to have the old folks with\r\nme. People take you with all your faults, if you're rich; but they won't\r\nswallow your family into the bargain. So if I don't have my own father\r\nand mother, whom I love dearly, and should like to see sitting at table,\r\nwith my servants behind their chairs, I could still less have sister\r\nJane. I recollect her very well, and she can't have got genteeler as\r\nshe's grown older. Therefore I beg you'll not set her on coming after\r\nme; it won't do by any manner of means. Don't say a word about me to\r\nher. But send the boy down here to his grandfather, and I'll see him\r\nquietly, you understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but it will be hard to separate her from the boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stuff! all boys are separated from their parents when they go into the\r\nworld. So that's settled! Now, just tell me. I know the old folks always\r\nsnubbed Jane--that is, mother did. My poor dear father never snubbed any\r\nof us. Perhaps mother has not behaved altogether well to Jane. But we\r\nmust not blame her for that; you see this is how it happened. There were\r\na good many of us, while father and mother kept shop in the High-street,\r\nso we were all to be provided for anyhow; and Jane, being very useful\r\nand handy at work, got a place when she was a little girl, and had no\r\ntime for learning. Afterward my father made a lucky hit, in getting my\r\nLord Lansmere's custom after an election, in which he did a great deal\r\nfor the Blues (for he was a famous electioneerer, my poor father). My\r\nLady stood godmother to Nora; and then most of my brothers and sisters\r\ndied off, and father retired from business; and when he took Jane from\r\nservice, she was so common-like that mother could not help contrasting\r\nher with Nora. You see Jane was their child when they were poor little\r\nshop-people, with their heads scarce above water; and Nora was their\r\nchild when they were well off, and had retired from trade, and lived\r\ngenteel: so that makes a great difference. And mother did not quite look\r\non her as her own child. But it was Jane's own fault; for mother would\r\nhave made it up with her if she had married the son of our neighbor the\r\ngreat linendraper, as she might have done; but she would take Mark\r\nFairfield, a common carpenter. Parents like best those of their children\r\nwho succeed best in life. Natural. Why, they did not care for me till I\r\ncame back the man I am. But to return to Jane: I'm afraid they've\r\nneglected her. How is she off?\"\r\n\r\n\"She earns her livelihood, and is poor, but contented.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, just be good enough to give her this,\" (and Richard took a\r\nbank-note of £50 from his pocket-book). \"You can say the old folks sent\r\nit to her; or that it is a present from Dick, without telling her he had\r\ncome back from America.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear sir,\" said the Parson, \"I am more and more thankful to have\r\nmade your acquaintance. This is a very liberal gift of yours; but your\r\nbest plan will be to send it through your mother. For, though I don't\r\nwant to betray any confidence you place in me, I should not know what to\r\nanswer if Mrs. Fairfield began to question me about her brother. I never\r\nhad but one secret to keep, and I hope I shall never have another. A\r\nsecret is very like a lie!\"\r\n\r\n\"You had a secret, then,\" said Richard, as he took back the bank-note.\r\nHe had learned, perhaps, in America, to be a very inquisitive man. He\r\nadded point-blank, \"Pray what was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what it would not be if I told you,\" said the Parson, with a\r\nforced laugh--\"a secret!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess we're in a land of liberty--do as you like. Now, I dare\r\nsay you think me a very odd fellow to come out of my shell to you in\r\nthis off-hand way. But I liked the look of you, even when we were at the\r\ninn together. And just now I was uncommonly pleased to find that,\r\nthough you are a Parson, you don't want to keep a man's nose down to a\r\nshop-board, if he has any thing in him. You're not one of the\r\naristocrats--\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said the Parson, with imprudent warmth, \"it is not the\r\ncharacter of the aristocracy of this country to keep people down. They\r\nmake way among themselves for any man, whatever his birth, who has the\r\ntalent and energy to aspire to their level. That's the especial boast of\r\nthe British constitution, sir!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you think so, do you?\" said Mr. Richard, looking sourly at the\r\nParson. \"I dare say those are the opinions in which you have brought up\r\nthe lad. Just keep him yourself, and let the aristocracy provide for\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson's generous and patriotic warmth evaporated at once, at this\r\nsudden inlet of cold air into the conversation. He perceived that he had\r\nmade a terrible blunder; and, as it was not his business at that moment\r\nto vindicate the British constitution, but to serve Leonard Fairfield,\r\nhe abandoned the cause of the aristocracy with the most poltroon and\r\nscandalous abruptness. Catching at the arm which Mr. Avenel had\r\nwithdrawn from him, he exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, sir, you are mistaken; I have never attempted to influence your\r\nnephew's political opinions. On the contrary, if, at his age, he can be\r\nsaid to have formed any opinion, I am greatly afraid--that is, I think\r\nhis opinions are by no means sound--that is, constitutional. I mean, I\r\nmean--\" And the poor Parson, anxious to select a word that would not\r\noffend his listener, stopped short in lamentable confusion of idea.\r\n\r\nMr. Avenel enjoyed his distress for a moment, with a saturnine smile,\r\nand then said,\r\n\r\n\"Well, I calculate he's a Radical. Natural enough, if he has not got a\r\nsixpence to lose--all come right by-and-by. I'm not a Radical--at least\r\nnot a destructive--much too clever a man for that, I hope. But I wish to\r\nsee things very different from what they are. Don't fancy that I want\r\nthe common people, who've got nothing, to pretend to dictate to their\r\nbetters, because I hate to see a parcel of fellows, who are called lords\r\nand squires, trying to rule the roast. I think, sir, that it is men like\r\nme who ought to be at the top of the tree! and that's the long and short\r\nof it. What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've not the least objection,\" said the crest-fallen Parson, basely.\r\nBut, to do him justice, I must add that he did not the least know what\r\nhe was saying!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nUnconscious of the change in his fate which the diplomacy of the Parson\r\nsought to effect, Leonard Fairfield was enjoying the first virgin\r\nsweetness of fame; for the principal town in his neighborhood had\r\nfollowed the then growing fashion of the age, and set up a Mechanics'\r\nInstitute; and some worthy persons interested in the formation of that\r\nprovincial Athenæum had offered a prize for the best Essay on the\r\nDiffusion of Knowledge--a very trite subject, on which persons seem to\r\nthink they can never say too much, and on which there is, nevertheless,\r\na great deal yet to be said. This prize Leonard Fairfield had recently\r\nwon. His Essay had been publicly complimented by a full meeting of the\r\nInstitute; it had been printed at the expense of the Society, and had\r\nbeen rewarded by a silver medal--delineative of Apollo crowning Merit\r\n(poor Merit had not a rag to his back; but Merit, left only to the care\r\nof Apollo, never is too good a customer to the tailor!) And the County\r\nGazette had declared that Britain had produced another prodigy in the\r\nperson of Dr. Riccabocca's self-educated gardener.\r\n\r\nAttention was now directed to Leonard's mechanical contrivances. The\r\nSquire, ever eagerly bent on improvements, had brought an engineer to\r\ninspect the lad's system of irrigation, and the engineer had been\r\ngreatly struck by the simple means by which a very considerable\r\ntechnical difficulty had been overcome. The neighboring farmers now\r\ncalled Leonard \"_Mr._ Fairfield,\" and invited him on equal terms to\r\ntheir houses. Mr. Stirn had met him on the high road, touched his hat,\r\nand hoped that \"he bore no malice.\" All this, I say, was the first\r\nsweetness of fame; and if Leonard Fairfield comes to be a great man, he\r\nwill never find such sweets in the after fruit. It was this success\r\nwhich had determined the Parson on the step which he had just taken, and\r\nwhich he had long before anxiously meditated. For, during the last year\r\nor so, he had renewed his old intimacy with the widow and the boy; and\r\nhe had noticed, with great hope and great fear, the rapid growth of an\r\nintellect, which now stood out from the lowly circumstances that\r\nsurrounded it in bold and unharmonizing relief.\r\n\r\nIt was the evening after his return home that the Parson strolled up to\r\nthe Casino. He put Leonard Fairfield's Prize Essay in his pocket. For he\r\nfelt that he could not let the young man go forth into the world without\r\na preparatory lecture, and he intended to scourge poor Merit with the\r\nvery laurel wreath which it had received from Apollo. But in this he\r\nwanted Riccabocca's assistance: or rather, he feared that, if he did not\r\nget the Philosopher on his side, the Philosopher might undo all the work\r\nof the Parson.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nA sweet sound came through the orange boughs, and floated to the ears of\r\nthe Parson, as he wound slowly up the gentle ascent--so sweet, so\r\nsilvery, he paused in delight--unaware, wretched man! that he was\r\nthereby conniving at Papistical errors. Soft it came, and sweet: softer\r\nand sweeter--\"Ave Maria!\" Violante was chanting the evening hymn to the\r\nVirgin Mother. The Parson at last distinguished the sense of the words,\r\nand shook his head with the pious shake of an orthodox Protestant. He\r\nbroke from the spell resolutely, and walked on with a sturdy step.\r\nGaining the terrace, he found the little family seated under an awning.\r\nMrs. Riccabocca knitting; the Signor with his arms folded on his breast:\r\nthe book he had been reading a few moments before had fallen on the\r\nground, and his dark eyes were soft and dreamy. Violante had finished\r\nher hymn, and seated herself on the ground between the two, pillowing\r\nher head on her step-mother's lap, but with her hand resting on her\r\nfather's knee, and her gaze fixed fondly on his face.\r\n\r\n\"Good evening,\" said Mr. Dale. Violante stole up to him, and, pulling\r\nhim so as to bring his ear nearer to her lip, whispered, \"Talk to papa,\r\ndo--and cheerfully; he is sad.\"\r\n\r\nShe escaped from him, as she said this, and appeared to busy herself\r\nwith watering the flowers arranged on stands round the awning. But she\r\nkept her swimming, lustrous eyes wistfully on her father.\r\n\r\n\"How fares it with you, my dear friend?\"' said the Parson, kindly, as he\r\nrested his hand on the Italian's shoulder. \"You must not let him get out\r\nof spirits, Mrs. Riccabocca.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very ungrateful to her if I ever am so,\" said the poor Italian,\r\nwith all his natural gallantry. Many a good wife, who thinks it is a\r\nreproach to her if her husband is ever \"out of spirits,\" might have\r\nturned peevishly from that speech more elegant than sincere, and so have\r\nmade bad worse. But Mrs. Riccabocca took her husband's proffered hand\r\naffectionately, and said with great _naiveté_--\r\n\r\n\"You see I am so stupid, Mr. Dale; I never knew I was so stupid till I\r\nmarried. But I am very glad you are come. You can get on some learned\r\nsubject together, and then he will not miss so much his--\"\r\n\r\n\"His what?\" asked Riccabocca inquisitively.\r\n\r\n\"His country. Do you think that I can not sometimes read your thoughts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very often. But you did not read them just then. The tongue touches\r\nwhere the tooth aches, but the best dentist can not guess at the tooth\r\nunless one opens one's mouth.--_Basta!_ Can we offer you some wine of\r\nour own making, Mr. Dale? it is pure.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd rather have some tea,\" quoth the Parson hastily.\r\n\r\nMrs. Riccabocca, too pleased to be in her natural element of domestic\r\nuse, hurried into the house to prepare our national beverage. And the\r\nParson, sliding into her chair, said:\r\n\r\n\"But you are dejected, then? Fie! If there's a virtue in the world at\r\nwhich we should always aim, it is cheerfulness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't dispute it,\" said Riccabocca, with a heavy sigh. \"But though it\r\nis said by some Greek, who, I think, is quoted by your favorite Seneca,\r\nthat a wise man carries his country with him at the soles of his feet,\r\nhe can't carry also the sunshine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what it is,\" said the Parson, bluntly. \"You would have a\r\nmuch keener sense of happiness if you had much less esteem for\r\nphilosophy.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cospetto!_\" said the Doctor, rousing himself. \"Just explain, will\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Does not the search after wisdom induce desires not satisfied in this\r\nsmall circle to which your life is confined? It is not so much your\r\ncountry for which you yearn, as it is for space to your intellect,\r\nemployment for your thoughts, career for your aspirations.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have guessed at the tooth which aches,\" said Riccabocca, with\r\nadmiration.\r\n\r\n\"Easy to do that,\" answered the Parson. \"Our wisdom teeth come last, and\r\ngive us the most pain. And if you would just starve the mind a little,\r\nand nourish the heart more, you would be less of a philosopher, and more\r\nof a--\" The Parson had the word \"Christian\" at the tip of his tongue: he\r\nsuppressed a word that, so spoken, would have been exceedingly\r\nirritating, and substituted, with inelegant antithesis, \"and more of a\r\nhappy man!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do all I can with my heart,\" quoth the Doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Not you! For a man with such a heart as yours should never feel the\r\nwant of the sunshine. My friend, we live in an age of over mental\r\ncultivation. We neglect too much the simple, healthful outer life, in\r\nwhich there is so much positive joy. In turning to the world within us,\r\nwe grow blind to this beautiful world without; in studying ourselves as\r\nmen, we almost forget to look up to heaven, and warm to the smile of\r\nGod.\"\r\n\r\nThe philosopher mechanically shrugged his shoulders, as he always did\r\nwhen another man moralized--especially if the moralizer were a priest;\r\nbut there was no irony in his smile, as he answered thoughtfully;\r\n\r\n\"There is some truth in what you say. I own that we live too much as if\r\nwe were all brain. Knowledge has its penalties and pains, as well as its\r\nprizes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just what I want you to say to Leonard.\"\r\n\r\n\"How have you settled the object of your journey?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you as we walk down to him after tea. At present, I am\r\nrather too much occupied with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me? The tree is formed--try only to bend the young twig!\"\r\n\r\n\"Trees are trees, and twigs twigs,\" said the Parson, dogmatically; \"but\r\nman is always growing till he falls into the grave. I think I have heard\r\nyou say that you once had a narrow escape of a prison?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very narrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just suppose that you were now in that prison, and that a fairy\r\nconjured up the prospect of this quiet home in a safe land; that you saw\r\nthe orange-trees in flower, felt the evening breeze on your cheek;\r\nbeheld your child gay or sad, as you smiled or knit your brow; that\r\nwithin this phantom home was a woman, not, indeed all your young\r\nromance might have dreamed of, but faithful and true, every beat of her\r\nheart all your own--would you not cry from the depth of the dungeon, 'O\r\nfairy! such a change were a paradise.' Ungrateful man! you want\r\ninterchange for your mind, and your heart should suffice for all!\"\r\n\r\nRiccabocca was touched and silent.\r\n\r\n\"Come hither, my child,\" said Mr. Dale, turning round to Violante, who\r\nstill stood among the flowers, out of hearing, but with watchful eyes.\r\n\"Come hither,\" he said, opening his arms.\r\n\r\nViolante bounded forward, and nestled to the good man's heart.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, Violante, when you are alone in the fields or the garden, and\r\nhave left your father looking pleased and serene, so that you have no\r\ncare for him at your heart--tell me, Violante, though you are all alone,\r\nwith the flowers below and the birds singing overhead, do you feel that\r\nlife itself is happiness or sorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Happiness!\" answered Violante, half shutting her eyes, and in a\r\nmeasured voice.\r\n\r\n\"Can you explain what kind of happiness it is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, impossible! and it is never the same. Sometimes it is so\r\nstill--so still--and sometimes so joyous, that I long for wings to fly\r\nup to God, and thank him!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, friend,\" said the Parson, \"this is the true sympathy between life\r\nand nature, and thus we should feel ever, did we take more care to\r\npreserve the health and innocence of a child. We are told that we must\r\nbecome as children to enter into the kingdom of heaven; methinks we\r\nshould also become as children to know what delight there is in our\r\nheritage of earth!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nThe maid-servant (for Jackeymo was in the fields) brought the table\r\nunder the awning, and, with the English luxury of tea, there were other\r\ndrinks as cheap and as grateful on summer evenings--drinks which\r\nJackeymo had retained and taught from the customs of the\r\nsouth--unebriate liquors, pressed from cooling fruits, sweetened with\r\nhoney, and deliciously iced; ice should cost nothing in a country in\r\nwhich one is frozen up half the year! And Jackeymo, too, had added to\r\nour good, solid, heavy English bread, preparations of wheat much\r\nlighter, and more propitious to digestion--with those crisp _grissins_,\r\nwhich seem to enjoy being eaten, they make so pleasant a noise between\r\none's teeth.\r\n\r\nThe Parson esteemed it a little treat to drink tea with the Riccaboccas.\r\nThere was something of elegance and grace in that homely meal, at the\r\npoor exile's table, which pleased the eye as well as taste. And the very\r\nutensils, plain Wedgewood though they were, had a classical simplicity,\r\nwhich made Mrs. Hazeldean's old India delf, and Mrs. Dale's best\r\nWorcester china, look tawdry and barbarous in comparison. For it was\r\nFlaxman who gave designs to Wedgewood, and the most truly refined of all\r\nour manufactures in porcelain (if we do not look to the mere material)\r\nis in the reach of the most thrifty.\r\n\r\nThe little banquet was at first rather a silent one; but Riccabocca\r\nthrew off his gloom, and became gay and animated. Then poor Mrs.\r\nRiccabocca smiled, and pressed the _grissins;_ and Violante, forgetting\r\nall her stateliness, laughed and played tricks on the Parson, stealing\r\naway his cup of warm tea when his head was turned, and substituting iced\r\ncherry-juice. Then the Parson got up and ran after Violante, making\r\nangry faces, and Violante dodged beautifully, till the Parson, fairly\r\ntired out, was too glad to cry \"Peace,\" and come back to the\r\ncherry-juice. Thus time rolled on, till they heard afar the stroke of\r\nthe distant church-clock, and Mr. Dale started up and cried, \"But we\r\nshall be too late for Leonard. Come, naughty little girl, get your\r\nfather his hat.\"\r\n\r\n\"And umbrella!\" said Riccabocca, looking up at the cloudless moonlit\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n\"Umbrella against the stars?\" asked the Parson, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"The stars are no friends of mine,\" said Riccabocca, \"and one never\r\nknows what may happen!\"\r\n\r\nThe Philosopher and the Parson walked on amicably.\r\n\r\n\"You have done me good,\" said Riccabocca, \"but I hope I am not always so\r\nunreasonably melancholic as you seem to suspect. The evenings will\r\nsometimes appear long, and dull too, to a man whose thoughts on the past\r\nare almost his sole companions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sole companions?--your child?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is so young.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your wife?\"\r\n\r\n\"She is so--,\" the bland Italian appeared to check some disparaging\r\nadjective, and mildly added, \"so good, I allow; but you must own that we\r\ncan not have much in common.\"\r\n\r\n\"I own nothing of the sort. You have your house and your interests, your\r\nhappiness and your lives, in common. We men are so exacting, we expect\r\nto find ideal nymphs and goddesses when we condescend to marry a mortal;\r\nand if we did, our chickens would be boiled to rags, and our mutton come\r\nup as cold as a stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Per Bacco, you are an oracle,\" said Riccabocca, laughing. \"But I am not\r\nso skeptical as you are. I honor the fair sex too much. There are a\r\ngreat many women who realize the ideal of men to be found in--the\r\npoets!\"\r\n\r\n\"There's my dear Mrs. Dale,\" resumed the Parson, not heeding this\r\nsarcastic compliment to the sex, but sinking his voice into a whisper,\r\nand looking round cautiously--\"there's my dear Mrs. Dale, the best woman\r\nin the world--an angel I would say, if the word was not profane; BUT--\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the BUT\" asked the Doctor demurely.\r\n\r\n\"BUT I too might say that 'we have not much in common,' if I were only\r\nto compare mind to mind, and, when my poor Carry says something less\r\nprofound than Madame de Stael might have said, smile on her in contempt\r\nfrom the elevation of logic and Latin. Yet, when I remember all the\r\nlittle sorrows and joys that we have shared together, and feel how\r\nsolitary I should have been without her--oh, then, I am instantly aware\r\nthat there is between us in common something infinitely closer and\r\nbetter than if the same course of study had given us the same equality\r\nof ideas; and I was forced to brace myself for a combat of intellect, as\r\nI am when I fall in with a tiresome sage like yourself. I don't pretend\r\nto say that Mrs. Riccabocca is a Mrs. Dale,\" added the Parson, with\r\nlofty candor--\"there is but one Mrs. Dale in the world; but still, you\r\nhave drawn a prize in the wheel matrimonial! Think of Socrates, and yet\r\nhe was content even with his--Xantippe!\"\r\n\r\nDr. Riccabocca called to mind Mrs. Dale's \"little tempers,\" and inly\r\nrejoiced that no second Mrs. Dale had existed to fall to his own lot.\r\nHis placid Jemima gained by the contrast. Nevertheless, he had the ill\r\ngrace to reply, \"Socrates was a man beyond all imitation!--Yet I believe\r\nthat even he spent very few of his evenings at home. But, _revenons à\r\nnos moutons_, we are nearly at Mrs. Fairfield's cottage, and you have\r\nnot yet told me what you have settled as to Leonard.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson halted, took Riccabocca by the button, and informed him, in\r\nvery few words, that Leonard was to go to Lansmere to see some relations\r\nthere, who had the fortune, if they had the will, to give full career to\r\nhis abilities.\r\n\r\n\"The great thing, in the mean while,\" said the Parson, \"would be to\r\nenlighten him a little as to what he calls--enlightenment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" said Riccabocca, diverted, and rubbing his hands, \"I shall listen\r\nwith interest to what you say on that subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"And must aid me; for the first step in this modern march of\r\nenlightenment is to leave the poor Parson behind; and if one calls out,\r\n'Hold! and look at the sign-post,' the traveler hurries on the faster,\r\nsaying to himself, 'Pooh, pooh!--that is only the cry of the Parson!'\r\nBut my gentleman, when he doubts me, will listen to you--you're a\r\nphilosopher!\"\r\n\r\n\"We philosophers are of some use now and then, even to Parsons!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you were not so conceited a set of deluded poor creatures already, I\r\nwould say 'Yes,'\" replied the Parson generously; and, taking hold of\r\nRiccabocca's umbrella, he applied the brass handle thereof, by way of a\r\nknocker, to the cottage door.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nCertainly it is a glorious fever that desire To Know! And there are few\r\nsights in the moral world more sublime than that which many a garret\r\nmight afford, if Asmodeus would bare the roofs to our survey--viz., a\r\nbrave, patient, earnest human being, toiling his own arduous way,\r\nathwart the iron walls of penury, into the magnificent Infinite, which\r\nis luminous with starry souls.\r\n\r\nSo there sits Leonard, the self-taught, in the little cottage alone;\r\nfor, though scarcely past the hour in which great folks dine, it is the\r\nhour in which small folks go to bed, and Mrs. Fairfield has retired to\r\nrest, while Leonard has settled to his books. He had placed his table\r\nunder the lattice, and from time to time he looked up and enjoyed the\r\nstillness of the moon. Well for him that, in reparation for those hours\r\nstolen from night, the hardy physical labor commenced with dawn.\r\nStudents would not be the sad dyspeptics they are, if they worked as\r\nmany hours in the open air as my scholar-peasant. But even in him you\r\ncould see that the mind had begun a little to affect the frame. They who\r\ntask the intellect must pay the penalty with the body. Ill, believe me,\r\nwould this work-day world get on if all within it were hard-reading,\r\nstudious animals, playing the deuce with the ganglionic apparatus.\r\n\r\nLeonard started as he heard the knock at the door; the Parson's\r\nwell-known voice reassured him. In some surprise, he admitted his\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\n\"We are come to talk to you, Leonard,\" said Mr. Dale, \"but I fear we\r\nshall disturb Mrs. Fairfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, sir! the door to the staircase is shut, and she sleeps\r\nsoundly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, this is a French book--do you read French, Leonard?\" asked\r\nRiccabocca.\r\n\r\n\"I have not found French difficult, sir. Once over the grammar, and the\r\nlanguage is so clear; it seems the very language for reasoning.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. Voltaire said justly, 'Whatever is obscure is not French,'\"\r\nobserved Riccabocca.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I could say the same of English,\" muttered the Parson.\r\n\r\n\"But what is this?--Latin too?--Virgil?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir. But I find I make little way there without a master. I fear I\r\nmust give it up\" (and Leonard sighed).\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen exchanged looks and seated themselves. The young\r\npeasant remained standing modestly, and in his air and mien there was\r\nsomething that touched the heart while it pleased the eye. He was no\r\nlonger the timid boy who had sunk from the frown of Mr. Stirn, nor that\r\nrude personation of simple physical strength, roused to undisciplined\r\nbravery, which had received its downfall on the village-green of\r\nHazeldean. The power of thought was on his brow--somewhat unquiet still,\r\nbut mild and earnest. The features had attained that refinement which is\r\noften attributed to race, but comes, in truth, from elegance of idea,\r\nwhether caught from our parents or learned from books. In his rich brown\r\nhair, thrown carelessly from his temples, and curling almost to the\r\nshoulders in his large blue eye, which was deepened to the hue of the\r\nviolet by the long dark lash--in that firmness of lip which comes from\r\nthe grapple with difficulties, there was considerable beauty, but no\r\nlonger the beauty of the mere peasant. And yet there was still about the\r\nwhole countenance that expression of goodness and purity which a painter\r\nwould give to his ideal of the peasant lover--such as Tasso would have\r\nplaced in the _Aminta_, or Fletcher have admitted to the side of the\r\nFaithful Shepherdess.\r\n\r\n\"You must draw a chair here, and sit down between us, Leonard,\" said the\r\nParson.\r\n\r\n\"If any one,\" said Riccabocca \"has a right to sit, it is the one who is\r\nto hear the sermon; and if any one ought to stand, it is the one who is\r\nabout to preach it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be frightened, Leonard,\" said the Parson, graciously; \"it is only\r\na criticism, not a sermon,\" and he pulled out Leonard's Prize Essay.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"You take for your motto this aphorism[8]--'_Knowledge is\r\nPower._--Bacon.'\"\r\n\r\nRICCABOCCA.--\"Bacon make such an aphorism! The last man in the world to\r\nhave said any thing so pert and so shallow.\"\r\n\r\nLEONARD (astonished).--\"Do you mean to say, sir, that that aphorism is\r\nnot in Lord Bacon! Why, I have seen it quoted as his in almost every\r\nnewspaper, and in almost every speech in favor of popular education.\"\r\n\r\nRICCABOCCA.--\"Then that should be a warning to you never again to fall\r\ninto the error of the would-be scholar--viz., quote second-hand. Lord\r\nBacon wrote a great book to show in what knowledge is power, how that\r\npower should be defined, in what it might be mistaken. And, pray, do you\r\nthink so sensible a man would ever have taken the trouble to write a\r\ngreat book upon the subject, if he could have packed up all he had to\r\nsay into the portable dogma, 'Knowledge is power?' Pooh! no such\r\naphorism is to be found in Bacon from the first page of his writings to\r\nthe last.\"\r\n\r\nPARSON (candidly).--\"Well, I supposed it was Lord Bacon's, and I am very\r\nglad to hear that the aphorism has not the sanction of his authority.\"\r\n\r\nLEONARD (recovering his surprise).--\"But why so?\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"Because it either says a great deal too much, or just--nothing\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\nLEONARD.--\"At least, sir, it seems to me undeniable.\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"Well, grant that it is undeniable. Does it prove much in favor\r\nof knowledge? Pray, is not ignorance power too?\"\r\n\r\nRICCABOCCA.--\"And a power that has had much the best end of the\r\nquarter-staff.\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"All evil is power, and does its power make it any thing the\r\nbetter?\"\r\n\r\nRICCABOCCA.--\"Fanaticism is power--and a power that has often swept away\r\nknowledge like a whirlwind. The Mussulman burns the library of a\r\nworld--and forces the Koran and the sword from the schools of Byzantium\r\nto the colleges of Hindostan.\"\r\n\r\nPARSON (bearing on with a new column of illustration).--\"Hunger is\r\npower. The barbarians, starved out of their energy by their own swarming\r\npopulation, swept into Italy and annihilated letters. The Romans,\r\nhowever degraded, had more knowledge, at least, than the Gaul and the\r\nVisigoth.\"\r\n\r\nRICCABOCCA (bringing up the reserve).--\"And even in Greece, when Greek\r\nmet Greek, the Athenians--our masters in all knowledge--were beat by the\r\nSpartans, who held learning in contempt.\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"Wherefore you see, Leonard, that though knowledge be power, it\r\nis only _one_ of the powers of the world; that there are others as\r\nstrong, and often much stronger; and the assertion either means but a\r\nbarren truism, not worth so frequent a repetition, or it means something\r\nthat you would find it very difficult to prove.\"\r\n\r\nLEONARD.--\"One nation may be beaten by another that has more physical\r\nstrength and more military discipline; which last, permit me to say,\r\nsir, is a species of knowledge--\"\r\n\r\nRICCABOCCA.--\"Yes; but your knowledge-mongers at present call upon us to\r\ndiscard military discipline, and the qualities that produce it, from the\r\nlist of the useful arts. And in your own essay, you insist upon\r\nknowledge as the great disbander of armies, and the foe of all military\r\ndiscipline.\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"Let the young man proceed. Nations, you say, may be beaten by\r\nother nations less learned and civilized?\"\r\n\r\nLEONARD.--\"But knowledge elevates a class. I invite my own humble order\r\nto knowledge, because knowledge will lift them into power.\"\r\n\r\nRICCABOCCA.--\"What do you say to that, Mr. Dale?\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"In the first place, is it true that the class which has the\r\nmost knowledge gets the most power? I suppose philosophers, like my\r\nfriend Dr. Riccabocca, think they have the most knowledge. And pray, in\r\nwhat age have philosophers governed the world? Are they not always\r\ngrumbling that nobody attends to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Per Bacco,\" said Riccabocca, \"if people had attended to us, it would\r\nhave been a droll sort of world by this time!\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"Very likely. But, as a general rule, those have the most\r\nknowledge who give themselves up to it the most. Let us put out of the\r\nquestion philosophers (who are often but ingenious lunatics), and speak\r\nonly of erudite scholars, men of letters and practical science,\r\nprofessors, tutors, and fellows of colleges. I fancy any member of\r\nParliament would tell us that there is no class of men which has less\r\nactual influence on public affairs. They have more knowledge than\r\nmanufacturers and ship-owners, squires and farmers; but, do you find\r\nthat they have more power over the Government and the votes of the House\r\nof Commons?\"\r\n\r\n\"They ought to have,\" said Leonard.\r\n\r\n\"Ought they?\" said the Parson: \"we'll consider that later. Meanwhile,\r\nyou must not escape from your own proposition, which is, that knowledge\r\nis power--not that it _ought_ to be. Now, even granting your corollary,\r\nthat the power of a class is therefore proportioned to its\r\nknowledge--pray, do you suppose that while your order, the operatives,\r\nare instructing themselves, all the rest of the community are to be at a\r\nstand-still? Diffuse knowledge as you may, you will never produce\r\nequality of knowledge. Those who have most leisure, application, and\r\naptitude for learning, will still know the most. Nay, by a very natural\r\nlaw, the more general the appetite for knowledge, the more the increased\r\ncompetition would favor those most adapted to excel by circumstance and\r\nnature. At this day, there is a vast increase of knowledge spread over\r\nall society, compared with that in the Middle Ages; but is there not a\r\nstill greater distinction between the highly-educated gentleman and the\r\nintelligent mechanic, than there was then between the baron who could\r\nnot sign his name and the churl at the plow? between the accomplished\r\nstatesman, versed in all historical lore, and the voter whose politics\r\nare formed by his newspaper, than there was between the legislator who\r\npassed laws against witches, and the burgher who defended his guild from\r\nsome feudal aggression? between the enlightened scholar and the dunce of\r\nto-day, than there was between the monkish alchemist and the block head\r\nof yesterday? Peasant, voter, and dunce of this century are no doubt\r\nwiser than the churl, burgher, and blockhead of the twelfth. But the\r\ngentleman, statesman, and scholar of the present age are at least quite\r\nas favorable a contrast to the alchemist, witch-burner, and baron of\r\nold. As the progress of enlightenment has done hitherto, so will it ever\r\ndo. Knowledge is like capital: the more there is in a country, the\r\ngreater the disparities in wealth between one man and another.\r\nTherefore, if the working class increase in knowledge, so do the other\r\nclasses; and if the working class rise peacefully and legitimately into\r\npower, it is not in proportion to their own knowledge alone, but rather\r\naccording as it seems to the knowledge of the other orders of the\r\ncommunity, that such augmentation of proportional power is just, and\r\nsafe, and wise.\"\r\n\r\nPlaced between the Parson and the Philosopher, Leonard felt that his\r\nposition was not favorable to the display of his forces. Insensibly he\r\nedged his chair somewhat away, and said mournfully--\r\n\r\n\"Then, according to you, the reign of knowledge would be no great\r\nadvance in the aggregate freedom and welfare of man?\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"Let us define. By knowledge, do you mean intellectual\r\ncultivation?--by the reign of knowledge, the ascendency of the most\r\ncultivated minds?\"\r\n\r\nLEONARD, (after a pause.)--\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nRICCABOCCA.--\"Oh indiscreet young man, that is an unfortunate concession\r\nof yours: for the ascendency of the most cultivated minds would be a\r\nterrible oligarchy!\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"Perfectly true; and we now reply to your exclamation, that men\r\nwho, by profession, have most learning ought to have more influence than\r\nsquires and merchants, farmers and mechanics. Observe, all the knowledge\r\nthat we mortals can acquire, is not knowledge positive and perfect, but\r\nknowledge comparative, and subject to all the errors and passions of\r\nhumanity. And suppose that you could establish, as the sole regulators\r\nof affairs, those who had the most mental cultivation, do you think they\r\nwould not like that power well enough to take all means their superior\r\nintelligence could devise to keep it to themselves? The experiment was\r\ntried of old by the priests of Egypt; and in the empire of China, at\r\nthis day, the aristocracy are elected from those who have most\r\ndistinguished themselves in learned colleges. If I may call myself a\r\nmember of that body, 'the people,' I would rather be an Englishman,\r\nhowever much displeased with dull Ministers and blundering Parliaments,\r\nthan I would be a Chinese under the rule of the picked sages of the\r\nCelestial Empire. Happily, therefore, my dear Leonard, nations are\r\ngoverned by many things besides what is commonly called knowledge; and\r\nthe greatest practical ministers, who, like Themistocles, have made\r\nsmall states great--and the most dominant races who, like the Romans,\r\nhave stretched their rule from a village half over the universe--have\r\nbeen distinguished by various qualities which a philosopher would sneer\r\nat, and a knowledge-monger would call 'sad prejudices,' and 'lamentable\r\nerrors of reason.'\"\r\n\r\nLEONARD (bitterly.)--\"Sir, you make use of knowledge itself to argue\r\nagainst knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"I make use of the little I know to prove the foolishness of\r\nidolatry. I do not argue against knowledge; I argue against\r\nknowledge-worship. For here, I see in your Essay, that you are not\r\ncontented with raising human knowledge into something like divine\r\nomnipotence, you must also confound her with virtue. According to you,\r\nwe have only to diffuse the intelligence of the few among the many, and\r\nall at which we preachers aim is accomplished.--Nay more; for whereas we\r\nhumble preachers have never presumed to say, with the heathen Stoic,\r\nthat even virtue is sure of happiness be low (though it be the best road\r\nto it), you tell us plainly that this knowledge of yours gives not only\r\nthe virtue of a saint, but bestows the bliss of a god. Before the steps\r\nof your idol, the evils of life disappear. To hear you, one has but 'to\r\nknow,' in order to be exempt from the sins and sorrows of the ignorant.\r\nHas it ever been so? Grant that you diffuse among the many all the\r\nknowledge ever attained by the few. Have the wise few been so unerring\r\nand so happy? You supposed that your motto was accurately cited from\r\nBacon. What was Bacon himself? The poet tells you--\r\n\r\n    'The wisest, brightest, _meanest_ of mankind.'\r\n\r\nCan you hope to bestow upon the vast mass of your order the luminous\r\nintelligence of this 'Lord Chancellor of nature?' Grant that you do\r\nso--and what guarantee have you for the virtue and the happiness which\r\nyou assume as the concomitants of the gift? See Bacon himself; what\r\nblack ingratitude! what miserable self-seeking! what truckling\r\nservility! what abject and pitiful spirit! So far from intellectual\r\nknowledge, in its highest form and type, insuring virtue and bliss, it\r\nis by no means uncommon to find great mental cultivation combined with\r\ngreat moral corruption.\" (Aside to Riccabocca)--\"Push on, will you?\"\r\n\r\nRICCABOCCA.--\"A combination remarkable in eras as in individuals.\r\nPetronius shows us a state of morals at which a commonplace devil would\r\nblush, in the midst of a society more intellectually cultivated than\r\ncertainly was that which produced Regulus or the Horatii. And the most\r\nlearned eras in modern Italy were precisely those which brought the\r\nvices into the most ghastly refinement.\"\r\n\r\nLEONARD (rising in great agitation, and clasping his hands.)--\"I can not\r\ncontend with you, who produce against information so slender and crude\r\nas mine the stores which have been locked from my reach. But I feel that\r\nthere must be another side to this shield--a shield that you will not\r\neven allow to be silver. And oh, if you thus speak of knowledge, why\r\nhave you encouraged me to know?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, my son!\" said the Parson, \"if I wished to prove the value of\r\nReligion, would you think I served it much, if I took as my motto,\r\n'Religion is power?' Would not that be a base and sordid view of its\r\nadvantages? And would you not say he who regards religion as a power,\r\nintends to abuse it as a priestcraft?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well put!\" said Riccabocca.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a moment--let me think. Ah--I see, sir!\" said Leonard.\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"If the cause be holy, do not weigh it in the scales of the\r\nmarket; if its objects be peaceful, do not seek to arm it with the\r\nweapons of strife; if it is to be the cement of society, do not vaunt it\r\nas the triumph of class against class.\"\r\n\r\nLEONARD (ingenuously.)--\"You correct me nobly, sir. Knowledge is power,\r\nbut not in the sense in which I have interpreted the saying.\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"Knowledge is _one_ of the powers in the moral world, but one\r\nthat, in its immediate result, is not always of the most worldly\r\nadvantage to the possessor. It is one of the slowest, because one of the\r\nmost durable, of agencies. It may take a thousand years for a thought to\r\ncome into power; and the thinker who originated it might have died in\r\nrags or in chains.\"\r\n\r\nRICCABOCCA.--\"Our Italian proverb saith that 'the teacher is like the\r\ncandle, which lights others in consuming itself.'\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"Therefore he who has the true ambition of knowledge should\r\nentertain it for the power of his idea, not for the power it may bestow\r\non himself; it should be lodged in the conscience, and, like the\r\nconscience, look for no certain reward on this side the grave. And since\r\nknowledge is compatible with good and with evil, would it not be better\r\nto say, 'Knowledge is a trust?'\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, sir,\" said Leonard, cheerfully, \"pray proceed.\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"You ask me why we encourage you to KNOW. First, because (as\r\nyou say yourself in your Essay) knowledge, irrespective of gain, is in\r\nitself a delight, and ought to be something far more. Like liberty, like\r\nreligion, it may be abused; but I have no more right to say that the\r\npoor shall be ignorant, than I have to say that the rich only shall be\r\nfree, and that the clergy alone shall learn the truths of redemption.\r\nYou truly observe in your treatise that knowledge opens to us other\r\nexcitements than those of the senses, and another life than that of the\r\nmoment. The difference between us is this, that you forget that the same\r\nrefinement which brings us new pleasures exposes us to new pains--the\r\nhorny hand of the peasant feels not the nettles which sting the fine\r\nskin of the scholar. You forget also, that whatever widens the sphere of\r\nthe desires, opens to them also new temptations. Vanity, the desire of\r\napplause, pride, the sense of superiority--gnawing discontent where that\r\nsuperiority is not recognized--morbid susceptibility, which comes with\r\nall new feelings--the underrating of simple pleasures apart from the\r\nintellectual--the chase of the imagination, often unduly stimulated, for\r\nthings unattainable below--all these are surely among the first\r\ntemptations that beset the entrance into knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard shaded his face with his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Hence,\" continued the Parson, benignantly--\"hence, so far from\r\nconsidering that we do all that is needful to accomplish ourselves as\r\nmen, when we cultivate only the intellect, we should remember that we\r\nthereby continually increase the range of our desires, and, therefore,\r\nof our temptations; and we should endeavor, simultaneously, to cultivate\r\nboth those affections of the heart, which prove the ignorant to be God's\r\nchildren no less than the wise, and those moral qualities which have\r\nmade men great and good when reading and writing were scarcely known--to\r\nwit, patience and fortitude under poverty and distress; humility and\r\nbeneficence amidst grandeur and wealth: and, in counteraction to that\r\negotism, which all superiority, mental or worldly, is apt to inspire,\r\nJustice, the father of all the more solid virtues, softened by Charity,\r\nwhich is their loving mother. Thus accompanied, knowledge, indeed,\r\nbecomes the magnificent crown of humanity--not the imperious despot, but\r\nthe checked and tempered sovereign of the soul.\"\r\n\r\nThe Parson paused, and Leonard, coming near him, timidly took his hand,\r\nwith a child's affectionate and grateful impulse.\r\n\r\nRICCABOCCA.--\"And if, Leonard, you are not satisfied with our Parson's\r\nexcellent definitions, you have only to read what Lord Bacon himself has\r\nsaid upon the true ends of knowledge, to comprehend at once how angry\r\nthe poor great man, whom Mr. Dale treats so harshly, would have been\r\nwith those who have stinted his elaborate distinctions and provident\r\ncautions, into that, coxcombical little aphorism, and then misconstrued\r\nall he designed to prove in favor of the commandant, and authority of\r\nlearning. For,\" added the sage, looking up as a man does when he is\r\ntasking his memory, \"I think it is thus that, after saying the greatest\r\nerror of all is the mistaking or misplacing the end of knowledge, and\r\ndenouncing the various objects for which it is vulgarly sought;--I think\r\nit is thus that he proceeds.... 'Knowledge is not a shop for profit or\r\nsale, but a rich storehouse for the glory of the Creator, and the relief\r\nof men's estate.'\"[9]\r\n\r\nPARSON (remorsefully.)--\"Are those Lord Bacon's words? I am very sorry I\r\nspoke so uncharitably of his life. I must examine it again. I may find\r\nexcuses for it now, that I could not when I first formed my judgment. I\r\nwas then a raw lad at Oxford. But I see, Leonard, there is still\r\nsomething on your mind.\"\r\n\r\nLEONARD.--\"It is true, sir. I would but ask whether it is not by\r\nknowledge that we arrive at the qualities and virtues you so well\r\ndescribe, but which you seem to consider as coming to us through\r\nchannels apart from knowledge?\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"If you mean by the word knowledge something very different\r\nfrom what you express in your essay--and which those contending for\r\nmental instruction, irrespective of religion and ethics, appear also to\r\nconvey by the word--you are right;--but, remember, we have already\r\nagreed that by the word knowledge we mean culture purely intellectual.\"\r\n\r\nLEONARD.--\"That is true--we so understood it.\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"Thus, when this great Lord Bacon erred, you may say that he\r\nerred from want of knowledge--the knowledge that moralists and preachers\r\nwould convey. But Lord Bacon had read all that moralists and preachers\r\ncould say on such matters; and he certainly did not err from want of\r\nintellectual cultivation. Let me here, my child, invite you to observe,\r\nthat He who knew most of our human hearts and our immortal destinies,\r\ndid not _insist_ on this intellectual culture as essential to the\r\nvirtues that form our well-being here, and conduce to our salvation\r\nhereafter. Had it been essential, the All-wise One would not have\r\nselected humble fishermen for the teachers of his doctrine, instead of\r\nculling his disciples from Roman Portico, or Athenian Academy. And this,\r\nwhich distinguishes so remarkably the Gospel from the ethics of heathen\r\nphilosophy, wherein knowledge is declared to be necessary to virtue, is\r\na proof how slight was the heathen sage's insight into the nature of\r\nmankind, when compared with the Saviour's; for hard, indeed, would it be\r\nto men, whether high or low, rich or poor, if science and learning, or\r\ncontemplative philosophy, were the sole avenues to peace and redemption;\r\nsince, in this state of ordeal, requiring active duties, very few, in\r\nany age, whether they be high or low, rich or poor, ever are or can be\r\ndevoted to pursuits merely mental. Christ does not represent heaven as a\r\ncollege for the learned. Therefore the rules of the Celestial Legislator\r\nare rendered clear to the simplest understanding as to the deepest.\"\r\n\r\nRICCABOCCA.--\"And that which Plato and Zeno, Pythagoras and Socrates,\r\ncould not do, was done by men whose ignorance would have been a by-word\r\nin the schools of the Greek. The gods of the vulgar were dethroned; the\r\nface of the world was changed! This thought may make us allow, indeed,\r\nthat there are agencies more powerful than mere knowledge, and ask,\r\nafter all, what is the mission which knowledge should achieve?\"\r\n\r\nPARSON.--\"The Sacred Book tells us even that; for, after establishing\r\nthe truth that, for the multitude, knowledge is not essential to\r\nhappiness and good, it accords still to knowledge its sublime part in\r\nthe revelation prepared and announced. When an instrument of more than\r\nordinary intelligence was required for a purpose divine--when the\r\nGospel, recorded by the simple, was to be explained by the acute,\r\nenforced by the energetic, carried home to the doubts of the\r\nGentile--the Supreme Will joined to the zeal of the earlier apostles the\r\nlearning and genius of St. Paul--not holier than the others--calling\r\nhimself the least, yet laboring more abundantly than them all--making\r\nhimself all things unto all men, so that some might be saved. The\r\nignorant may be saved no less surely than the wise; but here comes the\r\nwise man who helps to save! And how the fullness and animation of this\r\ngrand Presence, of this indomitable Energy, seem to vivify the toil, and\r\nto speed the work! 'In journeyings often, in perils of waters, in perils\r\nof robbers, in perils of mine own countrymen, in perils by the heathen,\r\nin perils in the city, in perils in the wilderness, in perils in the\r\nsea, in perils among false brethren.' Behold, my son! does not Heaven\r\nhere seem to reveal the true type of Knowledge--a sleepless activity, a\r\npervading agency, a dauntless heroism, an all-supporting faith?--a\r\npower--a power, indeed--a power apart from the aggrandizement of self--a\r\npower that brings to him who owns and transmits it but 'weariness and\r\npainfulness; in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings\r\noften, in cold and nakedness'--but a power distinct from the mere\r\ncircumstance of the man, rushing from him as rays from a sun;--borne\r\nthrough the air, and clothing it with light--piercing under earth, and\r\ncalling forth the harvest! Worship not knowledge--worship not the sun, O\r\nmy child! Let the sun but proclaim the Creator; let the knowledge but\r\nillumine the worship!\"\r\n\r\nThe good man, overcome by his own earnestness, paused; his head drooped\r\non the young student's breast, and all three were long silent.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nWhatever ridicule may be thrown upon Mr. Dale's dissertations by the wit\r\nof the enlightened, they had a considerable, and I think a beneficial\r\neffect upon Leonard Fairfield--an effect which may perhaps create less\r\nsurprise, when the reader remembers that Leonard was unaccustomed to\r\nargument, and still retained many of the prejudices natural to his\r\nrustic breeding. Nay, he actually thought it possible that, as both\r\nRiccabocca and Mr. Dale were more than double his age, and had had\r\nopportunities not only of reading twice as many books, but of\r\ncontracting experience in wider ranges of life--he actually, I say,\r\nthought it possible that they might be better acquainted with the\r\nproperties and distinctions of knowledge than himself. At all events,\r\nthe Parson's words were so far well-timed, that they produced in Leonard\r\nvery much of that state of mind which Mr. Dale desired to effect, before\r\ncommunicating to him the startling intelligence that he was to visit\r\nrelations whom he had never seen, of whom he had heard but little, and\r\nthat it was at least possible that the result of that visit might be to\r\nopen to him greater facilities for instruction, and a higher degree in\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nWithout some such preparation, I fear that Leonard would have gone forth\r\ninto the world with an exaggerated notion of his own acquirements, and\r\nwith a notion yet more exaggerated as to the kind of power that such\r\nknowledge as he possessed would obtain for itself. As it was, when Mr.\r\nDale broke to him the news of the experimental journey before him,\r\ncautioning him against being over-sanguine, Leonard received the\r\nintelligence with a serious meekness, and thoughts that were nobly\r\nsolemn.\r\n\r\nWhen the door closed on his visitors, he remained for some moments\r\nmotionless, and in deep meditation: then he unclosed the door, and stole\r\nforth. The night was already far advanced, the heavens were luminous\r\nwith all the host of stars. \"I think,\" said the student, referring, in\r\nlater life, to that crisis in his destiny--\"I think it was then, when I\r\nstood alone, yet surrounded by worlds so numberless, that I first felt\r\nthe distinction between _mind_ and _soul_.\" \"Tell me,\" said Riccabocca,\r\nas he parted company with Mr. Dale, \"whether you think we should have\r\ngiven to Frank Hazeldean, on entering life, the same lecture on the\r\nlimits and ends of knowledge which we have bestowed on Leonard\r\nFairfield.\"\r\n\r\n\"My friend,\" quoth the Parson, with a touch of human conceit; \"I have\r\nridden on horseback, and I know that some horses should be guided by the\r\nbridle, and some should be urged by the spur.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cospetto!\" said Riccabocca; \"you contrive to put every experience of\r\nyours to some use--even your journey on Mr. Hazeldean's pad. And I see\r\nnow why, in this little world of a village, you have picked up so\r\ngeneral an acquaintance with life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever read White's _Natural History of Selborne?_\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so, and you will find that you need not go far to learn the habits\r\nof birds, and know the difference between a swallow and a swift.--Learn\r\nthe difference in a village, and you know the difference wherever\r\nswallows and swifts skim the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swallows and swifts!--true; but men--\"\r\n\r\n\"Are with us all the year round--which is more than we can say of\r\nswallows and swifts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Dale,\" said Riccabocca, taking off his hat, with great formality,\r\n\"if ever again I find myself in a dilemma, I will come to you instead of\r\nto Machiavelli.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" cried the Parson, \"if I could but have a calm hour's talk with you\r\non the errors of the Papal relig--\"\r\n\r\nRiccabocca was off like a shot.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nThe next day, Mr. Dale had a long conversation with Mrs. Fairfield. At\r\nfirst, he found some difficulty in getting over her pride, and inducing\r\nher to accept overtures from parents who had so long slighted both\r\nLeonard and herself. And it would have been in vain to have put before\r\nthe good woman the worldly advantages which such overtures implied. But\r\nwhen Mr. Dale said, almost sternly, \"Your parents are old, your father\r\ninfirm; their least wish should be as binding to you as their command,\"\r\nthe widow bowed her head and said,\r\n\r\n\"God bless, them, sir, I was very sinful--'Honor your father and\r\nmother.' I'm no scollard, but I know the Commandments. Let Lenny go. But\r\nhe'll soon forget me, and mayhap he'll learn to be ashamed of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"There I will trust him,\" said the Parson; and he contrived easily to\r\nre-assure and soothe her.\r\n\r\nIt was not till all this was settled that Mr. Dale drew forth an\r\nunsealed letter, which Mr. Richard Avenel, taking his hint, had given to\r\nhim, as from Leonard's grandparents, and said, \"This is for you, and it\r\ncontains an inclosure of some value.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you read it, sir? As I said before, I'm no scollard.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Leonard is, and he will read it to you.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Leonard returned home that evening, Mrs. Fairfield showed him the\r\nletter. It ran thus:\r\n\r\n     \"DEAR JANE--Mr. Dale will tell you that we wish Leonard to come\r\n     to us. We are glad to hear you are well. We forward, by Mr.\r\n     Dale, a bank-note for £50, which comes from Richard, your\r\n     brother. So no more at present from your affectionate parents,\r\n\r\n                                    \"JOHN AND MARGARET AVENEL.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter was in a stiff, female scrawl, and Leonard observed that two\r\nor three mistakes in spelling had been corrected, either in another pen\r\nor in a different hand.\r\n\r\n\"Dear brother Dick, how good in him!\" cried the widow. \"When I saw there\r\nwas money, I thought it must be him. How I should like to see Dick\r\nagain. But I s'pose he's still in Amerikay. Well, well, this will buy\r\nclothes for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; you must keep it all, mother, and put it in the Savings' Bank.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not quite so silly as that,\" cried Mrs. Fairfield with contempt;\r\nand she put the fifty pounds into a cracked teapot.\r\n\r\n\"It must not stay there when I'm gone. You may be robbed, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, dear me, that's true. What shall I do with it?--what do I want\r\nwith it, too? Dear me! I wish they hadn't sent it. I shan't sleep in\r\npeace. You must e'en put it in your own pouch, and button it up tight,\r\nboy.\"\r\n\r\nLenny smiled, and took the note; but he took it to Mr. Dale, and begged\r\nhim to put it into the Savings' Bank for his mother.\r\n\r\nThe day following he went to take leave of his master, of Jackeymo, of\r\nthe fountain, the garden. But, after he had gone through the first of\r\nthese adieus with Jackeymo--who, poor man, indulged in all the lively\r\ngesticulations of grief which make half the eloquence of his countrymen;\r\nand then, absolutely blubbering, hurried away--Leonard himself was so\r\naffected that he could not proceed at once to the house, but stood\r\nbeside the fountain, trying hard to keep back his tears.\r\n\r\n\"You, Leonard--and you are going!\" said a soft voice; and the tears fell\r\nfaster than ever, for he recognized the voice of Violante.\r\n\r\n\"Do not cry,\" continued the child, with a kind of tender gravity. \"You\r\nare going, but papa says it would be selfish in us to grieve, for it is\r\nfor your good; and we should be glad. But I am selfish, Leonard, and I\r\ndo grieve. I shall miss you sadly.\"\r\n\r\n\"You, young lady--you miss me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. But I do not cry, Leonard, for I envy you, and I wish I were a\r\nboy: I wish I could do as you.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl clasped her hands, and reared her slight form, with a kind of\r\npassionate dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Do as me, and part from all those you love!\"\r\n\r\n\"But to serve those you love. One day you will come back to your\r\nmother's cottage, and say, 'We have conquered fortune.' Oh that I could\r\ngo forth and return, as you will. But my father has no country, and his\r\nonly child is a useless girl.\"\r\n\r\nAs Violante spoke, Leonard had dried his tears; her emotion distracted\r\nhim from his own.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" continued Violante, again raising her head loftily, \"what it is to\r\nbe a man! A woman sighs, 'I wish,' but man should say 'I will.'\"\r\n\r\nOccasionally before, Leonard had noted fitful flashes of a nature grand\r\nand heroic, in the Italian child, especially of late--flashes the more\r\nremarkable from their contrast to a form most exquisitely feminine, and\r\nto a sweetness of temper which made even her pride gentle. But now it\r\nseemed as if the child spoke with the command of a queen--almost with\r\nthe inspiration of a Muse. A strange and new sense of courage entered\r\nwithin him.\r\n\r\n\"May I remember these words!\" he murmured half audibly.\r\n\r\nThe girl turned and surveyed him with eyes brighter for their moisture.\r\nShe then extended her hand to him, with a quick movement, and, as he\r\nbent over it, with a grace taught to him by genuine emotion, she\r\nsaid,--\"And if you do, then, girl and child as I am, I shall think I\r\nhave aided a brave heart in the great strife for honor!\"\r\n\r\nShe lingered a moment, smiled as if to herself, and then, gliding away,\r\nwas lost among the trees.\r\n\r\nAfter a long pause, in which Leonard recovered slowly from the surprise\r\nand agitation into which Violante had thrown his spirits--previously\r\nexcited as they were--he went, murmuring to himself, toward the house.\r\nBut Riccabocca was from home. Leonard turned mechanically to the\r\nterrace, and busied himself with the flowers. But the dark eyes of\r\nViolante shone on his thoughts, and her voice rang in his ear.\r\n\r\nAt length Riccabocca appeared, followed up the road by a laborer, who\r\ncarried something indistinct under his arm.\r\n\r\nThe Italian beckoned to Leonard to follow him into the parlor, and after\r\nconversing with him kindly, and at some length, and packing up, as it\r\nwere, a considerable provision of wisdom in the portable shape of\r\naphorisms and proverbs, the sage left him alone for a few moments,\r\nRiccabocca then returned with his wife, and bearing a small knapsack:\r\n\r\n\"It is not much we can do for you, Leonard, and money is the worst gift\r\nin the world for a keepsake; but my wife and I have put our heads\r\ntogether to furnish you with a little outfit. Giacomo, who was in our\r\nsecret, assures us that the clothes will fit; and stole, I fancy, a coat\r\nof yours for the purpose. Put them on when you go to your relations; it\r\nis astonishing what a difference it makes in the ideas people form of\r\nus, according as our coats are cut one way or another. I should not be\r\npresentable in London thus; and nothing is more true than that a tailor\r\nis often the making of a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"The shirts, too, are very good holland,\" said Mrs. Riccabocca, about to\r\nopen the knapsack.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind details, my dear,\" cried the wise man; \"shirts are\r\ncomprehended in the general principle of clothes. And, Leonard, as a\r\nremembrance somewhat more personal, accept this, which I have worn many\r\na year when time was a thing of importance to me, and nobler fates than\r\nmine hung on a moment. We missed the moment, or abused it, and here I\r\nam, a waif on a foreign shore. Methinks I have done with Time.\"\r\n\r\nThe exile, as he thus spoke, placed in Leonard's reluctant hands a watch\r\nthat would have delighted an antiquary, and shocked a dandy It was\r\nexceedingly thick, having an outer case of enamel, and an inner one of\r\ngold. The hands and the figures of the hours had originally been formed\r\nof brilliants; but the brilliants had long since vanished. Still, even\r\nthus bereft, the watch was much more in character with the giver than\r\nthe receiver, and was as little suited to Leonard as would have been the\r\nred silk umbrella.\r\n\r\n\"It is old-fashioned,\" said Mrs. Riccabocca, \"but it goes better than\r\nany clock in the country. I really think it will last to the end of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Carissima mia!_\" cried the Doctor, \"I thought I had convinced you that\r\nthe world is by no means come to its last legs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I did not mean any thing, Alphonso,\" said Mrs. Riccabocca,\r\ncoloring.\r\n\r\n\"And that is all we do mean when we talk about that of which we can know\r\nnothing,\" said the Doctor, less gallantly than usual, for he resented\r\nthat epithet of \"old-fashioned,\" as applied to the watch.\r\n\r\nLeonard, we see, had been silent all this time; he could not\r\nspeak--literally and truly, he could not speak. How he got out of his\r\nembarrassment, and how he got out of the room, he never explained to my\r\nsatisfaction. But, a few minutes afterward, he was seen hurrying down\r\nthe road very briskly.\r\n\r\nRiccabocca and his wife stood at the window gazing after him.\r\n\r\n\"There is a depth in that boy's heart,\" said the sage, \"which might\r\nfloat an argosy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor dear boy! I think we have put every thing into the knapsack that\r\nhe can possibly want,\" said good Mrs. Riccabocca musingly.\r\n\r\nThe DOCTOR (continuing his soliloquy.)--\"They are strong, but they are\r\nnot immediately apparent.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. RICCABOCCA (resuming hers.)--\"They are at the bottom of the\r\nknapsack.\"\r\n\r\nThe DOCTOR.--\"They will stand long wear and tear.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. RICCABOCCA.--\"A year, at least, with proper care at the wash.\"\r\n\r\nThe DOCTOR (startled.)--\"Care at the wash! What on earth are you talking\r\nof, ma'am!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. RICCABOCCA (mildly.)--\"The shirts to be sure, my love! And you?\"\r\n\r\nThe DOCTOR (with a heavy sigh.)--\"The feelings, ma'am!\" Then, after a\r\npause, taking his wife's hand affectionately--\"But you did quite right\r\nto think of the shirts; Mr. Dale said very truly--\"\r\n\r\nMrs. RICCABOCCA.--\"What?\"\r\n\r\nThe DOCTOR.--\"That there was a great deal in common between us--even\r\nwhen I think of feelings, and you but of--shirts.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Avenel sat within the parlor--Mr. Richard stood on the\r\nhearth-rug, whistling Yankee Doodle. \"The Parson writes word that the\r\nlad will come to-day,\" said Richard suddenly--\"let me see the\r\nletter--ay, to day. If he took the coach as far as ----, he might walk\r\nthe rest of the way in two or three hours. He should be pretty nearly\r\nhere. I have a great mind to go and meet him: it will save his asking\r\nquestions, and hearing about me. I can clear the town by the back way,\r\nand get out at the high road.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll not know him from any one else,\" said Mrs. Avenel.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is a good one! Not know an Avenel! We've all the same cut of\r\nthe jib--have not we, father?\"\r\n\r\nPoor John laughed heartily, till the tears rolled down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n\"We were always a well-favored fam'ly,\" said John, recomposing himself.\r\n\"There was Luke, but he's gone; and Harry, but he's dead too, and Dick,\r\nbut he's in Amerikay--no, he's here; and my darling Nora, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" interrupted Mrs. Avenel; \"hush, John!\"\r\n\r\nThe old man stared at her, and then put his tremulous hand to his brow.\r\n\"And Nora's gone too!\" said he, in a voice of profound woe. Both hands\r\nthen fell on his knees, and his head drooped on his breast.\r\n\r\nMrs. Avenel rose, kissed her husband on the forehead, and walked away to\r\nthe window. Richard took up his hat, and brushed the nap carefully with\r\nhis handkerchief; but his lips quivered.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going,\" said he abruptly. \"Now mind, mother, not a word about Uncle\r\nRichard yet; we must first see how we like each other, and--(in a\r\nwhisper) you'll try and get that into my poor father's head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, Richard,\" said Mrs. Avenel quietly. Richard put on his hat, and\r\nwent out by the back way. He stole along the fields that skirted the\r\ntown, and had only once to cross the street before he got into the high\r\nroad.\r\n\r\nHe walked on till he came to the first milestone. There he seated\r\nhimself, lighted his cigar, and awaited his nephew. It was now nearly\r\nthe hour of sunset, and the road before him lay westward. Richard from\r\ntime to time looked along the road, shading his eyes with his hand; and\r\nat length, just as the disc of the sun had half sunk down the horizon, a\r\nsolitary figure came up the way. It emerged suddenly from the turn in\r\nthe road: the reddening beams colored all the atmosphere around it.\r\nSolitary and silent it came as from a Land of Light.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\"You have been walking far, young man,\" said Richard Avenel.\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, not very. That is Lansmere before me, is it not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is Lansmere; you stop there, I guess?\"\r\n\r\nLeonard made a sign in the affirmative, and walked on a few paces: then,\r\nseeing the stranger who had accosted him still by his side, he said--\r\n\r\n\"If you know the town, sir, perhaps you will have the goodness to tell\r\nme whereabouts Mr. Avenel lives?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can put you in a straight cut across the fields, that will bring you\r\njust behind the house.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very kind, but it will take you out of your way.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is in my way. So you are going to Mr. Avenel's?--a good old\r\ngentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've always heard so; and Mrs. Avenel--\"\r\n\r\n\"A particular superior woman,\" said Richard. \"Any one else to ask\r\nafter--I know the family well.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"They have a son, I believe; but he's in America, is not he?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe he is, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see the Parson has kept faith with me,\" muttered Richard.\r\n\r\n\"If you can tell me any thing about _him_,\" said Leonard, \"I should be\r\nvery glad.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why so, young man?--perhaps he is hanged by this time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hanged!\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a sad dog, I am told.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have been told very falsely,\" said Leonard, coloring.\r\n\r\n\"A sad wild dog--his parents were so glad when he cut and run--went off\r\nto the States. They say he made money; but, if so, he neglected his\r\nrelations shamefully.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" said Leonard, \"you are wholly misinformed. He has been most\r\ngenerous to a relative who had little claim on him; and I never heard\r\nhis name mentioned but with love and praise.\"\r\n\r\nRichard instantly fell to whistling Yankee Doodle, and walked on several\r\npaces without saying a word. He then made a slight apology for his\r\nimpertinence--hoped no offense--and, with his usual bold but astute\r\nstyle of talk, contrived to bring out something of his companion's mind.\r\nHe was evidently struck with the clearness and propriety with which\r\nLeonard expressed himself, raised his eyebrows in surprise more than\r\nonce, and looked him full in the face with an attentive and pleased\r\nsurvey. Leonard had put on the new clothes with which Riccabocca and\r\nwife had provided him. They were those appropriate to a young country\r\ntradesman in good circumstances; but as he did not think about the\r\nclothes, so he had unconsciously something of the ease of the gentleman.\r\n\r\nThey now came into the fields. Leonard paused before a slip of ground\r\nsown with rye.\r\n\r\n\"I should have thought grass land would have answered better, so near a\r\ntown,\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt it would,\" answered Richard; \"but they are sadly behind-hand\r\nin these parts. You see that great park yonder, on the other side of the\r\nroad? That would answer better for rye than grass; but then, what would\r\nbecome of my Lord's deer? The aristocracy eat us up, young man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the aristocracy did not sow this piece with rye, I suppose?\" said\r\nLeonard, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"And what do you conclude from that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let every man look to his own ground,\" said Leonard, with a cleverness\r\nof repartee caught from Doctor Riccabocca.\r\n\r\n\"'Cute lad you are,\" said Richard; \"and we'll talk more of these matters\r\nanother time.\"\r\n\r\nThey now came within sight of Mr. Avenel's house.\r\n\r\n\"You can get through the gap in the hedge, by the old pollard oak,\" said\r\nRichard; \"and come round by the front of the house. Why, you're not\r\nafraid--are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a stranger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I introduce you? I told you that I knew the old couple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no, sir! I would rather meet them alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go; and--wait a bit--harkye, young man, Mrs. Avenel is a cold mannered\r\nwoman; but don't be abashed by that.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard thanked the good-natured stranger, crossed the field, passed the\r\ngap, and paused a moment under the stinted shade of the old\r\nhollow-hearted oak. The ravens were returning to their nests. At the\r\nsight of a human form under the tree, they wheeled round, and watched\r\nhim afar. From the thick of the boughs, the young ravens sent their\r\nhoarse low cry.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nThe young man entered the neat, prim, formal parlor.\r\n\r\n\"You are welcome!\" said Mrs. Avenel, in a firm voice.\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman is heartily welcome,\" cried poor John.\r\n\r\n\"It is your grandson, Leonard Fairfield,\" said Mrs. Avenel.\r\n\r\nBut John who had risen with knocking knees, gazed hard at Leonard, and\r\nthen fell on his breast, sobbing aloud--\"Nora's eyes!--he has a blink in\r\nhis eyes like Nora's.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Avenel approached with a steady step, and drew away the old man\r\ntenderly.\r\n\r\n\"He is a poor creature,\" she whispered to Leonard--\"you excite him. Come\r\naway, I will show you your room.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard followed her up the stairs, and came into a room--neatly, and\r\neven prettily furnished. The carpet and curtains were faded by the sun,\r\nand of old-fashioned pattern, but there was a look about the room as if\r\nit had long been disused.\r\n\r\nMrs. Avenel sank down on the first chair on entering.\r\n\r\nLeonard drew his arm round her waist affectionately: \"I fear that I have\r\nput you out sadly--my dear grandmother.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Avenel glided hastily from his arm, and her countenance worked\r\nmuch--every nerve in it twitching as it were; then, placing her hand on\r\nhis locks, she said with passion, \"God bless you, my grandson,\" and left\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nLeonard dropped his knapsack on the floor, and looked around him\r\nwistfully. The room seemed as if it had once been occupied by a female.\r\nThere was a work-box on the chest of drawers, and over it hanging\r\nshelves for books, suspended by ribbons that had once been blue, with\r\nsilk and fringe appended to each shelf, and knots and tassels here and\r\nthere--the taste of a woman, or rather of a girl, who seeks to give a\r\ngrace to the commonest things around her. With the mechanical habit of a\r\nstudent, Leonard took down one or two of the volumes still left on the\r\nshelves. He found SPENSER'S _Fairy Queen_, RACINE in French, TASSO in\r\nItalian; and on the fly-leaf of each volume, in the exquisite\r\nhand-writing familiar to his memory, the name \"Leonora.\" He kissed the\r\nbooks, and replaced them with a feeling akin both to tenderness and awe.\r\n\r\nHe had not been alone in his room more than a quarter of an hour, before\r\nthe maid-servant knocked at his door and summoned him to tea.\r\n\r\nPoor John had recovered his spirits, and his wife sate by his side\r\nholding his hand in hers. Poor John was even gay. He asked many\r\nquestions about his daughter Jane, and did not wait for the answers.\r\nThen he spoke about the Squire, whom he confounded with Audley Egerton,\r\nand talked of elections, and the Blue party, and hoped Leonard would\r\nalways be a good Blue; and then he fell to his tea and toast, and said\r\nno more.\r\n\r\nMrs. Avenel spoke little, but she eyed Leonard askant, as it were, from\r\ntime to time; and after each glance the nerves of the poor severe face\r\ntwitched again.\r\n\r\nA little after nine o'clock Mrs. Avenel lighted a candle, and placing it\r\nin Leonard's hand, said, \"You must be tired--you know your own room now.\r\nGood-night.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard took the light, and, as was his wont with his mother, kissed\r\nMrs. Avenel on the cheek. Then he took John's hand and kissed him too.\r\nThe old man was half asleep and murmured dreamily, \"That's Nora.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard had retired to his room about half-an-hour, when Richard Avenel\r\nentered the house softly, and joined his parents.\r\n\r\n\"Well, mother?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Richard--you have seen him?\"\r\n\r\n\"And like him. Do you know he has a great look of poor Nora?--more like\r\nher than Jane?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he is handsomer than Jane ever was, but more like your father than\r\nany one. John was so comely. You take to the boy then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, that I do. Just tell him in the morning that he is to go with a\r\ngentleman who will be his friend, and don't say more. The chaise shall\r\nbe at the door after breakfast. Let him get into it: I shall wait for\r\nhim out of the town. What's the room you give him?\"\r\n\r\n\"The room you would not take.\"\r\n\r\n\"The room in which Nora slept? Oh, no! I could not have slept a wink\r\nthere. What a charm there was in that girl!--how we all loved her! But\r\nshe was too beautiful and good for us--too good to live!\"\r\n\r\n\"None of us are too good,\" said Mrs. Avenel with great austerity, \"and I\r\nbeg you will not talk in that way. Good-night--I must get your poor\r\nfather to bed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Leonard opened his eyes-the next morning, they rested on the face\r\nof Mrs. Avenel, which was bending over his pillow. But it was long\r\nbefore he could recognize that countenance, so changed was its\r\nexpression--so tender, so motherlike. Nay, the face of his own mother\r\nhad never seemed to him so soft with a mother's passion.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" he murmured, half rising, and flinging his young arms round her\r\nneck. Mrs. Avenel, this time, and for the first, taken by surprise,\r\nwarmly returned the embrace: she clasped him to her breast, she kissed\r\nhim again and again. At length with a quick start she escaped, and\r\nwalked up and down the room, pressing her hands tightly together. When\r\nshe halted her face had recovered its usual severity and cold precision.\r\n\r\n\"It is time for you to rise, Leonard,\" said she. \"You will leave us\r\nto-day. A gentleman has promised to take charge of you, and do for you\r\nmore than we can. A chaise will be at the door soon--make haste.\"\r\n\r\nJohn was absent from the breakfast-table. His wife said that he never\r\nrose till late, and must not be disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe meal was scarce over before a chaise and pair came to the door.\r\n\r\n\"You must not keep the chaise waiting--the gentleman is very punctual.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he is not come.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he has walked on before, and will get in after you are out of the\r\ntown.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is his name, and why should he care for me, grandmother?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will tell you himself. Now, come.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will bless me again, grandmother. I love you already.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do bless you,\" said Mrs. Avenel firmly. \"Be honest and good, and\r\nbeware of the first false step.\" She pressed his hand with a convulsive\r\ngrasp, and led him to the outer door.\r\n\r\nThe postboy clanked his whip, the chaise rattled off. Leonard put his\r\nhead out of the window to catch a last glimpse of the old woman. But the\r\nboughs of the pollard oak, and its gnarled decaying trunk, hid her from\r\nhis eye. And look as he would, till the road turned, he saw but the\r\nmelancholy tree.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] This aphorism has been probably assigned to Lord Bacon upon the mere\r\nauthority of the index to his works. It is the aphorism of the\r\nindex-maker, certainly not of the great master of inductive philosophy.\r\nBacon has, it is true, repeatedly dwelt on the power of knowledge, but\r\nwith so many explanations and distinctions, that nothing could be more\r\nunjust to his general meaning than to attempt to cramp into a sentence\r\nwhat it costs him a volume to define. Thus, if in one page he appears to\r\nconfound knowledge with power, in another he sets them in the strongest\r\nantithesis to each other; as follows, \"Adeo, signanter Deus opera\r\npotentiæ et sapientiæ diseriminavit.\" But it would be as unfair to Bacon\r\nto convert into an aphorism the sentence that discriminates between\r\nknowledge and power as it is to convert into an aphorism any sentence\r\nthat confounds them.\r\n\r\n[9] \"But the greatest error of all the rest is the mistaking or\r\nmisplacing of the last or farthest end of knowledge:--for men have\r\nentered into a desire of learning and knowledge, sometimes upon a\r\nnatural curiosity and inquisitive appetite; sometimes to entertain their\r\nminds with variety and delight; sometimes for ornament and reputation;\r\nand sometimes to enable them to victory of wit and contradiction; and\r\nmost times for lucre and profession;\"--[that is, for most of those\r\nobjects which are meant by the ordinary citers of the saying, 'Knowledge\r\nis power;'] \"and seldom, sincerely, to give a true account of these\r\ngifts of reason to the benefit and use of men; as if there were sought\r\nin knowledge a couch whereupon to rest a searching and restless spirit;\r\nor a terrace for a wandering and variable mind to walk up and down, with\r\na fair prospect; or a tower of state for a proud mind to raise itself\r\nupon; or a fort or commanding ground for strife and contention; or a\r\nshop for profit or sale--and not a rich storehouse for the glory of the\r\nCreator, and the relief of men's estate.\"--ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING, BOOK\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLE JOHN; OR, THE ROUGH ROAD TO RICHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland affords, even in these degenerate days of peace, innumerable\r\nexamples of the class called \"lucky fellows;\" that is to say, men who\r\nhave begun life with a charity-school education and a shilling, and are\r\nnow prosperous in wealth and station. Perhaps it is hardly fair to\r\nimpute to good-luck, what may be mainly owing to industry, frugality,\r\npatience, and perseverance. But, after all, one may starve with all\r\nthese virtues, in spite of all that copy-book maxims may say to the\r\ncontrary. There is good-luck in success, whatever may have been the\r\nqualities by which that good luck has been seized at the right moment\r\nand turned to good account. Industry, frugality, patience, and\r\nperseverance, form a perfect locomotive--good-luck is the engine-driver\r\nwho turns the handle and sets them in motion at the right moment.\r\n\r\nMen who have been the \"architects of their own fortunes,\" never admit\r\nthat good luck has had any thing to do with their prosperity. Their\r\npardonable vanity at their own success makes them guilty of a species\r\nof ingratitude to Providence. Listen to one of these old gentlemen\r\nholding forth to his hopeful son or nephew on his, the said old\r\ngentleman's, past life; on his early poverty, his self-denial, his hard\r\nwork, and his subsequent reward; and the burden of his discourse is ever\r\nthe same,\r\n\r\n    \"_Alone_ I did it, boy!\"\r\n\r\nShould the listener at any point be tempted rashly to exclaim \"how\r\nlucky!\" the old gentleman will turn on him with a severe frown and say,\r\n\"luck, sir; nonsense. There's no such thing as luck. Live on a crust,\r\nsir; that's the only way for a man to get on in the world.\" The old\r\ngentleman quite forgets that if his first venture in the _Chutnee_ East\r\nIndiaman had been a failure; or his first dabble in the stocks had not\r\nbeen followed by the battle of Leipsic; or his senior partner, who had\r\nnine-tenths of the profits of the business, had not departed this life\r\nsuddenly in an apoplectic fit, he would have held a very different\r\nposition in the world, and probably have been now a denizen of the\r\nsecond floor over his counting-house in the city, instead of a resident\r\nin Hyde Park Gardens.\r\n\r\nAn excellent specimen of this class of old gentlemen is \"Uncle John.\"\r\nThe obscurity of his early days is so great that even he himself finds\r\nit difficult to penetrate it. That he had a father and a mother is\r\nincontestable; but these worthy people seem to have left this world of\r\nsin at so early a period of \"Uncle John's\" existence, that, for all\r\npractical purposes, he might as well have been without them. His first\r\njuvenile recollections are connected with yellow stockings, leather\r\nshorts, a cutaway coatee with a tin badge on it, and a little round\r\nwoolen cap with a tuft in the middle of it, resting on a head formed by\r\nnature to accommodate a cap of double its dimensions. In a word, \"Uncle\r\nJohn\" was a charity-boy.\r\n\r\nIt must not be imagined that the above fact has ever been communicated\r\nby Uncle John himself; for the worthy man is weak enough to be ashamed\r\nof it, though he will discourse of his early privations in a mystical\r\nmanner, with the design apparently of inducing you to regard him rather\r\nas a counterpart of Louis Philippe in his days of early exile, than as a\r\ncommonplace, though equally interesting (to a right-thinking mind) young\r\ngentleman in yellow stockings. It _is_ a fact, however, as indisputable\r\nas that Uncle John is now worth thirty or forty thousand pounds.\r\n\r\nEmerging from the charity-school, and exchanging the leather shorts and\r\nyellow stockings for corduroys and gray worsted socks, Uncle John\r\nobtained the appointment of office-boy to a Temple attorney. His duties\r\nwere multifarious--sweeping the office and serving writs, cleaning boots\r\nand copying declarations. His emoluments were not large--seven shillings\r\na week and \"find himself,\" which was less difficult, poor boy, than to\r\nfind any thing _for_ himself. But Uncle John persevered and was not\r\ndisheartened. He lived literally on a crust, and regaled himself only\r\nwith the savory smells issuing from the cook's-shop, which was not only\r\nan economical luxury, but had the advantage of affording a stimulus to\r\nthe imagination. He actually saved two shillings a week out of his\r\nsalary, not to mention an occasional donation of a shilling on high days\r\nand holidays from his master.\r\n\r\nUncle John was never idle. When he had nothing to do for his master,\r\nwhich was rarely the case, he used to take a pen and any loose piece of\r\npaper or parchment, and copy, or imitate, the lawyer's engrossing\r\nhand--known as court-hand--till he became a good penman in this cramped\r\nstyle of writing. Having accomplished this object, Uncle John determined\r\nto \"better himself,\" by getting a situation as copying clerk instead of\r\noffice boy. He succeeded in his attempts, and was installed in another\r\nattorney's office as engrossing clerk at twelve shillings a week--a\r\nsalary which appeared to him, at the time, enormous. But riches did not\r\nturn his head. The only increase which he made in his previous\r\nexpenditure, was in wearing a rather cleaner shirt, and discarding\r\ncorduroys for some more genteel material. Uncle John was too wise and\r\ntoo self-denying to be seduced _inside_ the cook's-shop yet.\r\n\r\nHe was now saving at least six shillings a week, which is £15 a year!\r\nFor four years no change took place in his condition. He still lived in\r\nhis solitary garret; worked hard all day, and borrowed law books from\r\nthe articled clerks in the office, which he read at home at night. At\r\nhome! poor fellow--what a name for his miserable little room up in the\r\ntiles of a house in a narrow court out of Fleet-street! But Uncle John\r\nwas a brave fellow, and worked on without stopping to sentimentalize.\r\n\r\nA promotion now took place in the office, and Uncle John was made chief\r\ncommon-law clerk at one pound a week. He had rendered himself quite\r\ncompetent for the duties by his midnight studies. He was never absent\r\nfrom his post, never forgot any thing, and was never ill; for he had the\r\nstrength of a horse. It is suspected that about this time, Uncle John\r\npaid one or two visits to the cook's-shop; but it must not be supposed\r\nthat the visits were _more_ than one or two. As a rule, Uncle John dined\r\non a piece of the cheapest meat he could purchase, boiled by himself in\r\nhis garret.\r\n\r\nHe was wise enough, however, to be very neat in his dress, and thereby\r\ngained the credit of being a very respectable young man in the eyes of\r\nhis employer; for it is a very remarkable fact that clerks are always\r\nexpected to dress like gentlemen when their salaries are not even large\r\nenough to buy them food.\r\n\r\nAnother four years passed away, when one day Uncle John, having duly\r\nscrewed up his courage, walked into his master's private room, and,\r\nafter a little preliminary hesitation, ventured to hint that he should\r\nlike to be articled! The master stared--the clerk remained silently\r\nawaiting his answer.\r\n\r\n\"Are you aware,\" inquired the former, \"that the expense of the stamp,\r\n&c., is one hundred and twenty pounds?\"\r\n\r\nUncle John _was_ aware of it, and he was prepared with the money. He had\r\nsaved it out of his miserable salary.\r\n\r\nThe master stared still more. But, after a short time, he consented to\r\narticle Uncle John, and to continue his salary during the term of his\r\narticles. Uncle John was in ecstasies, and so far forgot his usual\r\nprudence that evening as to indulge in half a pint of bad port wine--a\r\ntaste, by the way, which he has retained to this day.\r\n\r\nHe was now a happy man. Every thing was \"en train\" now to make him one\r\nday a \"gentleman by Act of Parliament\"--as attorneys are facetiously\r\ntermed. It would certainly require something more than even the\r\nomnipotence of an Act of Parliament to confer the character on some of\r\nthe fraternity.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of his articles the managing clerk died, and Uncle\r\nJohn was promoted to that office with a salary of two hundred a year.\r\nHere was, indeed, a rise in life--from seven shillings a week to two\r\nhundred a year! Happy Uncle John. But you deserved it all; for you had\r\nplenty of the courage which is prepared for all ills, and endures those\r\nwhich it can not conquer.\r\n\r\nLong before the five years of his articles had expired, the clerk had\r\nmade himself so absolutely necessary to the master, that the latter\r\ncould scarcely have carried on the business for a month without him.\r\nTherefore, when the time arrived at which he ceased to be a clerk and\r\nbecame himself an attorney, Uncle John hinted to his master that he was\r\ngoing to leave him. Cunning Uncle John! You had no such intention; but\r\nyou knew that your master would take alarm, beg you to stay, and offer\r\nyou a partnership. Of course--and he did so.\r\n\r\nUncle John's path in life was from henceforth comparatively smooth. He\r\nwas the working partner in a business which was both profitable and of\r\ngood quality. Within a few years his partner was foolish enough to\r\nquarrel with him, and to demand a dissolution of the partnership. Uncle\r\nJohn readily consented, and all the clients knowing well who was the man\r\nthat understood the business and transacted it, followed him; and he\r\nbecame an attorney with a practice of two thousand a year, and no\r\npartner to share the profits.\r\n\r\nHis economical habits never forsook him. He married and kept a decent\r\ntable; but save in a love of good wine (or at least what his uneducated\r\ntaste considered so), he had nothing but the ordinary necessaries of\r\nlife. How much he saved each year who shall say? He had no children, and\r\nhis practice increasing while his wants stood still, he became what he\r\nis now--a prosperous and highly respected old gentleman.\r\n\r\nIt is the fashion of the old to point out such men as models for the\r\nimitation of the rising generation. The young, on the contrary, make\r\nthem the subjects of their ridicule, for their bad grammar and worse\r\nmanners. Let us see if we can find out the truth, unbiased by either\r\nparty. Uncle John is now a rich man, an honorable man, a hardworking\r\nman, and in the main a sensible man. He has attained his position in\r\nlife by patience, perseverance, and industry, favored also by a little\r\nof that good luck to which we first referred. But Uncle John is\r\ndeficient in many of the characteristics which adorn human nature. Is it\r\nnot natural that he should be so? Where was he to learn the gentler\r\nfeelings of his kind--affection, sympathy, benevolence? In his garret,\r\nalone and unfriended? He is mean and parsimonious. He is worth forty\r\nthousand pounds, and his deceased brother's child is starving with his\r\nwife in a suburban garret. Uncle John will not aid him with a penny. Who\r\naided _him_? Did _he_ not live in a garret, and save money too? Was _he_\r\nsuch a fool as to marry before he could keep a wife? Uncle John was\r\nguilty of no weaknesses in those days; he can not forgive them in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nHis only brother dies, leaving a large family and a widow--unprovided\r\nfor: for the children have eaten up all he could ever earn. Uncle John\r\ndoes not like the widow (perhaps because she had so many children), but\r\nhe gives her £50 a year. His own income is about four thousand.\r\n\r\nHis only sister is also left a widow without a sixpence. Uncle John\r\ngives _her_ £50 a year. \"People should not marry imprudently. He can\r\nafford no more; he has a great many calls upon him.\" Perhaps so; but the\r\nanswer to such calls is always, \"not at home.\"\r\n\r\nHe has many clerks now. He makes them all work twelve hours a day. Why\r\nnot? _He_ worked twelve hours a day.\r\n\r\nHe has articled clerks too. They must work twelve hours a day also. _He_\r\ndid it. True, Uncle John; but you had your salary for it; while they, on\r\nthe contrary, pay you for the privilege of working for you.\r\n\r\nThere is an old adage that a slave makes the worst tyrant. Uncle John\r\nexemplifies it. Because he suffered poverty and privation, he thinks\r\nthat every youth should endure the same. Because nature had given him\r\nthe constitution of a horse, he thinks that every one should have a\r\nsimilar one.\r\n\r\nSuch men as Uncle John are striking examples of certain qualities; and\r\nof those particular qualities which conduce to success in life. Their\r\nhighest praise (perhaps there is no higher praise in the world) is their\r\nunflinching integrity. But we can not bring ourselves to think them--on\r\nthe whole--models for imitation. After all, there is selfishness at the\r\nbottom of their first motives, and this quality grows with their growth,\r\nand strengthens with their strength, till, in their old age, they are\r\nimpatient at all the enjoyments of youth. The hardships of their younger\r\ndays are not only to be pitied for the pain they must have inflicted at\r\nthe time, but because they have closed up all the avenues through which\r\nthe gentler, nobler, and more generous sympathies of our nature find\r\ntheir way into the heart. Their want of education has not been of the\r\nmind alone, but of the affections; and as it is ten thousand times more\r\ndifficult to learn a language or a science in old age than in youth, so\r\nit is infinitely more difficult (if it be not impossible) to teach the\r\nscience of the affections, and the language of the heart, to the old man\r\nwhose youth has known nothing of either. Affliction and adversity teach\r\noft-times sympathy and benevolence; but to do so they must have followed\r\non happier times, and not have been a birth-portion. You may praise and\r\nrespect \"Uncle Johns,\" but you can not love them--neither can they love\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDARLING DOREL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothea Sibylla, Duchess of Brieg, was born at Cöln, on the River\r\nSpree, in Prussia, on the 19th of October, 1590. She was the daughter of\r\nElizabeth of Anhalt, and of John George, Margrave and Elector of\r\nBrandenburg, of the old princely Ascanian race. At the death of her\r\nhusband in 1598, the widowed margravine retired to Crossen to\r\nsuperintend her daughter's education. In due time, suitors were not\r\nwanting for the hand of young Dorothea Sibylla: among others, the King\r\nof Denmark; but he sued in vain. Dorothea, at length, fixed her\r\naffection on John Christian, Duke of Liegnitz and Brieg, who enjoyed a\r\ngreat reputation for virtue, ability, and integrity. To him, after a\r\nshort courtship. Dorothea was married on the 12th of December, 1610, at\r\nCrossen; and reached Brieg--the small capital of her future\r\ndominions--on the first of January in the following year.\r\n\r\nSuch is the dry sum of a charming Court biography, which first appeared\r\nin a periodical published in 1829, in Silesia, and which has been twice\r\nrepublished in a separate form--once (in 1838) at Brieg, under the title\r\nof \"Passages from the Life of Dorothea Sibylla, Duchess of Liegnitz and\r\nBrieg.\" It purports to consist of extracts from the journal of a certain\r\ntanner and furrier of Brieg, named Valentinus Gierth, an occasional\r\nguest at the ducal castle, and ardent admirer of the duchess. As a\r\nsimple, and--if internal evidence be worth any thing--truthful picture\r\nof German-Court life during the early part of the seventeenth century,\r\nit is not to be gainsayed; although suspicions of its authenticity have\r\nbeen cast upon it, similar to those which damaged the charms of the\r\n\"Diary of Lady Willoughby,\" by eventually proving it to be a fiction.\r\n\r\nDorothea is described as a pattern of goodness, common sense, virtue,\r\nand piety. In domestic management, she was pre-eminent. For her own\r\nimmediate attendants, she appointed fourteen maids of honor; and the\r\nfirst families of the land looked upon it as an inestimable privilege to\r\nplace their daughters at the ducal court; which was a high school of\r\nall noble virtues and accomplishments, \"whereof the duchess herself was\r\nthe chief teacher and most perfect model.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be more primitive than the duchess's intercourse with the\r\ntownspeople. Occasionally she walked in the streets of Brieg accompanied\r\nby her maids of honor, and chatted with such of the townspeople as were\r\nsitting on the benches outside their doors. The little children looked\r\nforward with the greatest delight to these town walks of the duchess;\r\nfor the ladies-in-waiting invariably carried about with them in their\r\npockets all sorts of sweetmeats, which the duchess distributed among the\r\nlittle claimants. For this reason, the little children stood peeping\r\nround the corners of the streets, when it got wind that the duchess was\r\nabout to walk out; more especially when it was surmised that the duke\r\nwould not be with her. So soon, therefore, as Dorothea Sibylla left the\r\ncastle gate, the little urchins would run through the town, like\r\nwildfire, crying out, \"The darling Dorel is coming!--the darling Dorel\r\nis coming!\"\r\n\r\nThe manner in which this endearing designation first came to her ears is\r\nrelated with affecting simplicity. \"It happened,\" says Master Gierth,\r\nwith true German particularity, \"on the 10th of September (old style) in\r\nthe year of our Lord, 1613;\" that being the Feast of St. Sibylla--one of\r\nthe duchess's name-saints--and also the second birth-day of her son\r\nGeorge. There was a great feast at the castle; to which the towns-folks\r\nand the children of the High and Guild Schools were invited.\r\n\r\n\"From the terrace,\" quoth the chronicler, \"the whole procession moved\r\nalong a wide, smooth walk before the orangery; where the quality, as\r\nwell as the children, were richly treated with strong, spiced wine,\r\norange-water, and confectionery. Her ladyship did, likewise, lay certain\r\npresents before the young lord, her son; she did, likewise, examine the\r\nchildren's school-books, and the master's report, wherein the conduct of\r\nthe children was noted, and did put apposite questions to them touching\r\ntheir Christian belief, and the like; and, on receiving right proper\r\nanswers, her face did shine like an angel's.\r\n\r\n\"One little maiden, however, which was weak and ignorant, was not able\r\nto answer the questions aright; whereupon her ladyship did ask:\r\n\r\n\"'My child, what is your name?' Whereunto she did answer, 'Anna Pohlin.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' asked her ladyship, 'and what is my name?'\r\n\r\n\"Straightway the little maiden did answer, 'Darling Dorel!'\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon Master Valentinus Gierth was somewhat affronted, but did\r\nquickly recover himself and, stepping up to her ladyship, did say:\r\n\r\n\"'Most gracious lady! I trust your ladyship will pardon these words, and\r\nnot take them amiss; inasmuch, as it is true that the women of this\r\ntown, as well as of the neighboring villages, when they do speak of your\r\nladyship, do commonly call your ladyship the Darling Dorel.'\r\n\r\n\"Then did the duchess fold her hands, and, raising them to heaven, did\r\nsay:\r\n\r\n\"'God be praised for such a precious title! the which, as long as I am\r\nin my senses, I would not exchange against 'Your Majesty!'\r\n\r\n\"The duke did, thereupon, embrace her ladyship, saying:\r\n\r\n\"'Away with the title, 'princely consort!' I will ever henceforth call\r\nthee by none other save 'Darling Dorel!'\"\r\n\r\nWe by no means intend to follow the good tanner through his minute\r\nrecords; but merely write thus much, as necessary preface to a quaint\r\nlittle love story. Premising that the duchess had sent, after her usual\r\nfashion, a marriage present to a certain lady, by two of her maids of\r\nhonor (by name Agnes and Mary), we shall transfer the narrative to our\r\npages in Master Gierth's own manner.\r\n\r\nAfter the presentation of the gifts, and when the marriage ceremony was\r\nconcluded, the two maids of honor were preparing to return to Brieg,\r\nwhen the bride's father stopped them, saying:\r\n\r\n\"'How? Shall I suffer two such angels of joy to depart, without tasting\r\nof my food and my drink? Nay, noble damsels, ye must abide here awhile\r\nbeyond the marriage festivities, and be of good cheer! I will\r\nimmediately dispatch a trusty messenger on horse to her most gracious\r\nladyship, the duchess, and obtain leave for your sojourn here.'\r\n\r\n\"The two damsels did, therefore, abide there the space of three days,\r\nand became acquainted with two gallants of the place; with whom they did\r\nexchange love-tokens and rings. But when the two damsels returned to\r\nBrieg to render an account of their mission, the duchess did note the\r\nrings on the fingers of the two damsels, and questioned them how they\r\ncame thereby. So soon, therefore, as the two damsels did confess the\r\ntruth, their mistress, half-jestingly, and half in earnest, said unto\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n\"'How now, ye gad-abouts! ye have scarce chipped the egg-shell, and\r\nhave, as yet, no means to make the pot boil, seeing that ye are poor\r\norphans, and under age; and ye yet dare to listen to the nonsense of\r\nstrange gallants, unbeknown to your foster-mother! Tell me, foolish\r\nyoung things, ought I not to take the rod to you? Take off the rings\r\nfrom your fingers, and give them to me. I will send them back; seeing\r\nthat the betrothal is null and void, and mere child's play.'\r\n\r\n\"The young damsels did then obey her ladyship, but wept apace the while.\r\nThis caused her ladyship to have compassion upon them, and she did\r\nminister comfort to them thus:\r\n\r\n\"'Ah! beloved daughters! ye shed bitter, hot tears that ye do not\r\nalready wear the curch [the German head dress of married women]. But if\r\nye did but know the heaviness of being wedded wives, even when the cares\r\nare lightest, ye would rejoice! Meanwhile, the matter hath been carried\r\non against all Christian order. I have always heard that the lover first\r\nmaketh his suit known to the parents or the guardians, and that then\r\nthe betrothal taketh place. Your suitors must needs be in great haste.\r\nWhy stand they in such great necessity of pushing their suit?'\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon the damsel Agnes plucked up an heart, and said quickly,\r\n\r\n\"'Most gracious lady! the gentlemen did come with us; and have already\r\nthe consent of their own parents to make their suit if they be but\r\nencouraged by a sign of approval.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah! Heaven have mercy!' cried the duchess, joining her hands. 'Have\r\nye, scape-graces indeed, brought your gallants hither? I dare not\r\ninquire further. May be, ye have hidden them in your chambers? Meggy\r\n(the duchess's nurse), beg his lordship to come hither; I must talk the\r\nmatter over with him.'\r\n\r\n\"'After the duke had come and heard that which had befallen, he\r\nstraightways asked the names of the gallants; and when the damsels had\r\ninformed his grace thereof, his lordship did turn unto his consort,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n\"'Listen, Darling Dorel: the parents, on both sides, are most worthy\r\npersons, and of unblemished birth. I advise that thou shouldst give thy\r\nconsent thereunto! Remember, dearest, that we twain were of one mind\r\nlong before I made known my suit unto thy mother.'\r\n\r\n\"Whereupon her ladyship did strike her lord upon the mouth with her\r\nkerchief, and said,\r\n\r\n\"'Well!--well!--but we must first look at these youths, and learn what\r\nthey are like. Tell us now, young damsels, where are your lovers hidden,\r\nand what is the signal ye have agreed upon?'\r\n\r\n\"Agnes did immediately tell her ladyship that the gallants were housed\r\nat the Golden Pitcher; and, whereas the Lion's Tower, in the palace,\r\ncould thence be plainly discerned, they had agreed to tie a white\r\nkerchief round the neck of one of the lions as a signal that there was\r\nhope for them! The gallants had agreed to abide at the hostel the space\r\nof eight days. Should the matter, however, turn out ill, the kerchief\r\ndisplayed was to be black.\r\n\r\n\"'Well done,' said the duchess to her husband; 'they wish to take two\r\nfortresses at once; and would have the white flag wave without firing a\r\nshot, and without attempting a storm.'\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon the Duke Christian did take the hand of his beloved wife, and\r\nspoke, somewhat in an under tone:\r\n\r\n\"'Darling wife! was not the green branch so often stuck in your window\r\nat Crossen; also a white flag? Moreover, thou knowest little of a siege;\r\npreparations for storming a citadel are not made during the daylight;\r\nbut secretly, in the night season, in order that the garrison perceive\r\nthem not. Shots may already have been fired. Tell me, young girls, have\r\nye already kissed the gallants? Mary, do you speak; ye have not yet\r\nopened your mouth: make a clean breast.'\r\n\r\n\"'Ah! most gracious liege,' answered Mary, 'the gentlemen have, indeed,\r\nsqueezed hands in secret, while we sat at table; and during the\r\nmarriage-dance, and at sundry other dances, we kissed each other--seeing\r\nthat others did the like. But we could not be alone with them at any\r\nother time; for the bride's mother was always about us, and we lay in\r\nher room. Neither, on the way home, had we much liberty; seeing that the\r\nold secretary, whom her ladyship did send with us, did observe us most\r\nnarrowly. But, when the old man did look out of the window of the\r\ncarriage, then did the gallants look tenderly upon us, and did kiss\r\ntheir hands to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"'There, now,' said his lordship, turning to his wife, 'you see that the\r\nsiege was conducted with vigor. The squeezing of hands was the parley;\r\nthe kisses the cannon-balls, sent so freely; and the tender looks the\r\nshells. Depend upon it the storm can not long be delayed. Listen,\r\ndarling wife, my heart melts when I bethink me that we also, in our\r\nyouth, could not brook a long delay.'\r\n\r\n\"'Let the drums beat the chamade [parley], and let us show our colors!'\r\nsaid the duchess; while she threw her arms round her husband's neck, and\r\nstopped his mouth with a kiss. The duke did then ask her, jestingly,\r\n'But which flag shall it be?'\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon the two young damsels did cry aloud, as with one voice:\r\n\r\n\"'The white!--most gracious liege!--the white!'\r\n\r\n\"The duchess could not choose but laugh heartily, and his lordship did\r\nimmediately order a servant to mount the tower, and to tie a white\r\nkerchief round one of the lion's necks. His lordship did then sing an\r\nold song the children are wont to sing on May-day:\r\n\r\n    \"'A stately house my lord doth keep,\r\n    Two maidens from the windows peep;\r\n    A kerchief white the one doth wave,\r\n    Because they fain would husbands have.'\r\n\r\nAnd then did depart to put on better apparel, wherein to await the\r\ncoming of the wooers. He did also command that all the court ladies and\r\nthe courtiers should be present at the wooing. Meanwhile, 'Darling\r\nDorel' did ask the damsels where they had gotten the rings which they\r\nhad presented to their gallants in return for theirs? Thereupon Agnes\r\ndid reply unto her ladyship:\r\n\r\n\"'Most gracious lady! we are but poor orphans, and possess nought save\r\npoor little gold rings belonging to our departed mothers, And these we\r\ncould not bear to part with. We have therefore promised to buy rings\r\nwith our savings, and deliver them to our gallants on some fitting\r\nopportunity.'\r\n\r\n\"'In this case,' said her ladyship, 'ye are but half betrothed, and\r\nthere is yet time to think twice of the matter;' nevertheless, her\r\nladyship did praise the young damsels, inasmuch as they did not part\r\nlightly and rashly with their mothers' trinkets. She advised them,\r\nmoreover, to tarry; as they or their gallants might change their minds.\r\n\r\n\"This speech did much alarm the damsels, who did then believe the whole\r\nmatter to be postponed; and they did forthwith begin to weep, and to\r\nbeseech her ladyship, not for this account, to cause their lovers to\r\nalter their mind, seeing that they, the damsels, were poor, and were not\r\nlikely soon to get other suitors.\r\n\r\n\"The duchess did then say unto them: 'The misfortune would not be so\r\ngreat! I would find husbands for you soon enough.' Hereupon, she turned\r\nto old Meggy, and said,\r\n\r\n\"'Ah! most worthy nurse, what a life does a wretched princess lead! Had\r\nI but married an honest burgher, then should I have had nothing but my\r\nhousehold duties and my children to attend to; I could have gone quietly\r\nto bed, slept without care, and waked with pleasure; but in my position\r\nevery thing is otherwise. Alack, when my other damsels come hither, and\r\nlearn that these silly girls are already betrothed, they will all run\r\nmad, and I shall have to send them to all the marriage feasts throughout\r\nthe duchy to pick up husbands.'\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon, she sent the nurse Meggy for her jewel box, opened it, and\r\ngave to each of the two damsels a handsome ring, the which they might\r\npresent to their lovers, and thus return their pledge; but under this\r\ncondition, that they were not to deliver their rings until the duchess\r\ngave them a sign thereunto with her kerchief.\r\n\r\n\"While all this was going on, the duke on his part had entered the\r\nduchess's apartment, accompanied by the chamberlain, all the gentlemen\r\nof his court, and the maids of honor. The lovers, meanwhile, were on the\r\nlook out, and were not aware that matters had gone to such a length\r\ntouching their love affairs. They had joyfully obeyed the white signal,\r\nand stood near unto the gates of the castle waiting for some opportunity\r\nof seeing their betrothed. The duke perceived this, and hereupon opened\r\nthe window, and called unto the soldiers on guard, 'Arrest me those two\r\nfellows, and conduct them to the guard-house, until further orders!'\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon the damsels, Agnes and Mary, were exceedingly afraid. The\r\nduke, however, did comfort them with the following words:\r\n\r\n\"'This is on your account; hasten and put on proper attire; ye still\r\nhave got on your old clothes, and must adorn yourselves.'\r\n\r\n\"The damsels ran gleefully and quickly into their rooms; whither the\r\nduchess sent after them two other damsels to aid them in plaiting their\r\nhair. They soon returned; and each of the damsels about to be betrothed\r\nhad put on the bridal wreath belonging to her mother.\r\n\r\n\"The duke now ordered the lovers to be summoned from the guard-house.\r\nThey were sore abashed when they entered the room; especially when his\r\ngracious lordship addressed the following questions to them:\r\n\r\n\"'What are your names? Have you passports? and what is your will?'\r\n\r\n\"The young men twirled their caps in their hands; stared first at their\r\nloves, and then at their gracious lieges; but could not utter a word,\r\nand stood looking very sheepish.\r\n\r\n\"'Ah!' said his lordship, 'never in my life did I meet with two such\r\ndumb fellows. My dominions will soon touch those of Oppeln, and you\r\nserve excellent well as landmarks! can neither of ye say 'yea or nay?'\r\nAnswer me straight! Have ye got the consent of your parents to propose\r\nfor those two chits; and are ye ready to affirm the same on your word of\r\nhonor, as gentlemen?'\r\n\r\n\"Then did the young men recover their speech, and they both answered,\r\n'Yea.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well,' said the duke, 'I will now believe ye, and keep you at my court\r\nsome few days; but as ye may be rogues and vagabonds for all that I\r\nknow, I will therefore send a messenger on horseback to your parents to\r\nget further intelligence, and ye must have patience the while.'\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon the damsel, Mary, turned to the duchess, and said to her with\r\ngreat simplicity,\r\n\r\n\"'Most gracious lady, the gentlemen have spoken truth! Their parents\r\nhave given them permission to woo us. We have concealed nothing from\r\nthem, but confessed in the presence of the old lady Wentzkin, that we\r\nwere poor orphan girls, and have no dower. But the mothers of our two\r\nlovers said that all was well; if only we brought a blessing from\r\nDarling Dorel, they should value it more than an earldom! This Agnes and\r\nI can affirm on oath.'\r\n\r\n\"On hearing this, the duchess folded her hands in prayer, looked toward\r\nheaven with tears in her eyes, and still praying, and gave the signal\r\nwith her kerchief. Immediately the damsels placed the rings on the\r\nfingers of their lovers, knelt down before the duchess, and besought her\r\nblessing. The duchess laid her hands upon the heads of the young girls\r\nand said,\r\n\r\n\"'God alone, who is in heaven, knows whether this will prove a blessing\r\nor a curse; but, if God hear the prayer of a weak woman, it will prove a\r\nblessing! Bethink ye of your deceased parents; and may their blessing\r\nevermore accompany ye! And therefore, let us most fervently utter the\r\nLord's Prayer.'\r\n\r\n\"Hereupon all present fell upon their knees, and prayed in a low voice;\r\nbut her most gracious ladyship did say the Lord's Prayer aloud.\r\n\r\n\"After the prayer was finished, the duchess made a sign to the chief\r\nlady about the court, who did thereupon bring, on a silver salver, two\r\nhalf wreaths, which were twined in the hair of the two damsels, Agnes\r\nand Mary, after they had taken off their own wreaths; for it was the\r\ncustom, in Brieg, for betrothed maidens to wear only half wreaths until\r\ntheir wedding-day, when they wore whole ones. The chamberlain did\r\nhereupon display from the window a red flag; upon which signal the ducal\r\nband did strike up a merry tune with trumpets and kettle-drums from the\r\ncastle tower; whereupon a crowd gathered in the town to know the cause\r\nof such rejoicing at the palace.\r\n\r\n\"So soon, therefore, as the betrothed couples had duly thanked his grace\r\nand the duchess by kissing the hems of their garments, her gracious\r\nladyship did announce to the betrothed damsels, that they should tarry\r\nwith her for the space of one year, in order more fully to learn their\r\nhousehold duties, and to strengthen them in the practice of the\r\nChristian virtues; seeing that they were still, as the duchess said, as\r\nignorant as callow geese! Moreover, their clothes and furniture had to\r\nbe provided, and the like. But to the gentlemen, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Mind, gentlemen, ye must also make the best of it! Ye are scarce out of\r\nleading-strings, and must go through some sort of ordeal. I would advise\r\nyou to travel, if so be your parents can afford it.'\r\n\r\n\"'By all means,' added the duke; 'my Darling Dorel is perfectly right:\r\nyou must travel; and, if ye know not whither, go to Jericho, and get ye\r\nsome beards to your faces.'\r\n\r\n\"As it was yet early in the day, his gracious lordship did order dinner\r\nto be prepared: to which, besides the Town Council, and their wives and\r\nchildren, Master Valentinus Gierth and his wife Susanna, were invited.\r\n\r\n\"His gracious lordship was exceeding merry, and the duchess was most\r\nkind in her manner; nevertheless, the guests did not fail to mark that\r\nher gracious ladyship did oftentimes look toward the new brides, and\r\nthat big tears did sometimes roll down her cheek the while.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURTESY OF AMERICANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI like the Americans more and more: either they have improved\r\nwonderfully lately, or else the criticisms on them have been cruelly\r\nexaggerated. They are particularly courteous and obliging; and seem, I\r\nthink, amiably anxious that foreigners should carry away a favorable\r\nimpression of them. As for me, let other travelers say what they please\r\nof them, I am determined not to be prejudiced, but to judge of them\r\nexactly as I find them; and I shall most pertinaciously continue to\r\npraise them (if I see no good cause to alter my present humble opinion),\r\nand most especially for their obliging civility and hospitable attention\r\nto strangers, of which I have already seen several instances.\r\n\r\nI have witnessed but very few isolated cases, as yet, of the unrefined\r\nhabits so usually ascribed to them; and those cases decidedly were not\r\namong the higher orders of people; for there seems just as much\r\ndifference in America as any where else in some respects. The superior\r\nclasses here have almost always excellent manners, and a great deal of\r\nreal and natural, as well as acquired refinement, and are often besides\r\n(which perhaps will not be believed in fastidious England) extremely\r\ndistinguished-looking. By the way, the captains of the steamboats appear\r\na remarkably gentlemanlike race of men in general, particularly\r\ncourteous in their deportment, and very considerate and obliging to the\r\npassengers.--_Lady Emeline Wortley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monthly Record of Current Events._\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL AND GENERAL NEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe past month has been remarkable for general quiet and for an absence\r\nof excitement of any kind, rather than for events either of political or\r\ngeneral interest. It has often been noted as characteristic of the\r\nAmerican Republic, that, however fierce and menacing popular excitement\r\nmay appear to be, it disappears with the immediate event which gave it\r\nbirth. A presidential election, for instance, calls forth the most\r\nembittered and apparently dangerous contests between different sections\r\nof the Union, and an observer, unacquainted with the character of our\r\npeople, and the practical working of our institutions, would naturally\r\nexpect that the result, whatever it might be, would excite the defeated\r\nparty to armed resistance, and plunge the country into civil war. But\r\nthe whole country is never so quiet--the public mind is never so free\r\nfrom agitation, as immediately after an excited election contest. The\r\nadjournment of Congress has had a similar effect. Stimulants to\r\nsectional or party feeling are no longer there applied; the public\r\nattention is no longer fastened upon public men, and social and civil\r\nlife resume their ordinary channels of quiet and harmonious progress.\r\n\r\nSome of the State Legislatures are still in session, but their action is\r\ntoo local to excite general interest. A very important Act has passed\r\nthe Legislature of the State of New York, re-organizing the Common\r\nSchool System of the State, and placing it partially upon the free\r\nbasis. By the law of 1849 all the common schools of the State were made\r\nentirely free, their cost being paid by county, town, and district\r\ntaxation. This was found to be highly obnoxious, chiefly from that\r\nprovision which gave the _voters_ in any district power to tax the\r\n_property_ of the district _ad libitum_ for school purposes. The new law\r\nwas passed to remedy those objections. By its provisions a State tax of\r\n$800,000 is annually imposed upon the property of the State, and\r\ndistributed among the schools. The balance, if any should be required,\r\nis to be collected by rate-bill from those who send to school, indigent\r\npersons being exempt, at the expense of property of the town. The bill\r\nhas become a law and will go into operation next fall. Another very\r\nimportant measure has been introduced into the Legislature, concerning\r\nthe enlargement of the Erie Canal. The Constitution of the State sets\r\napart the surplus revenues of the canals in each year, for the\r\ncompletion of the enlargement; but the rapidly increasing competition of\r\nrailroads has led the Legislature to perceive the necessity of\r\naccomplishing this work more rapidly than it can be done in the way\r\nhitherto adopted. The bill referred to proposes to borrow money on the\r\ncredit of the surplus revenues set apart by the Constitution; and with\r\nthe money thus procured, to complete the enlargement forthwith, setting\r\napart the revenues as a fund to redeem the certificates. The measure was\r\nvery strenuously resisted by the Democratic party, chiefly on the ground\r\nthat it was unconstitutional. This, however, was denied by the friends\r\nof the bill. It was argued with great ability and zeal on both sides. In\r\nthe Assembly the bill passed, by a vote of 76 ayes and 21 nays In the\r\nSenate it is still under consideration. We have already recorded the\r\nattempt and failure of the Legislature to elect a Senator in the\r\nCongress of the United States. On the 18th of March the effort was\r\nrenewed by a joint resolution, and after a session protracted until two\r\nhours after midnight, it resulted, through the absence of two Democratic\r\nSenators, in the choice, by separate nomination of each House, of\r\nHAMILTON FISH. In the Senate there were 16 votes for, and 12 against\r\nhim. In the House he received 68 votes and there were but 8 against him.\r\nHe has accepted the office.--The members of the Legislature and the\r\nState Officers paid a visit of three days to the City of New York, on\r\nthe invitation of the Mayor and Common Council. They visited the\r\ndifferent public and charitable institutions, of this city and Brooklyn;\r\nand were entertained at a public dinner at the Astor House, on the\r\nevening of March 22d. This is the first visit of the kind ever made.--A\r\nbill for the suppression of gambling, containing some stringent\r\nprovisions, having been introduced into the Senate, and referred to a\r\ncommittee of three, GEORGE W. BULL, sergeant-at-arms of that body,\r\nendeavored to enter into negotiations with the reputed proprietor of a\r\ngambling \"hell\" in New York to delay or defeat the bill, for an adequate\r\ncompensation. He managed to procure a note from the committee to the\r\neffect that the bill would not come up the present session. The attempt\r\nwas exposed, and the offender forthwith dismissed from his office. An\r\nunsuccessful attempt was made to implicate the senatorial committee in\r\nthis scandalous affair, upon the ground that they could not have been\r\nignorant of the purpose for which their note was procured.\r\n\r\nNothing of special importance has occurred in any section of the\r\ncountry. In Ohio the Legislature has adopted a series of resolutions\r\nconcerning the Fugitive Slave law, urging a faithful execution of the\r\nlaw, but recommending such modifications as experience may prove to be\r\nessential. In view of the Act of the Legislature of South Carolina,\r\nproviding for the appointment of delegates to a Southern Congress, the\r\nGeneral Assembly of Virginia has passed a series of resolutions to the\r\nfollowing purport: 1. That while Virginia sympathizes in the feelings\r\nexcited by the interference of the non-slaveholding States with the\r\ndomestic institutions of the South, yet the people of that State \"are\r\nunwilling to take any action, in consequence of the same, calculated to\r\ndestroy the integrity of this Union.\" 2. That regarding the Compromise\r\nmeasures, \"taken together, as an adjustment of the exciting questions to\r\nwhich they relate, and cherishing the hope that if fairly executed, they\r\nwill restore to the country that harmony and confidence, which of late\r\nhave been so unhappily disturbed, the State of Virginia deems it unwise,\r\nin the present condition of the country, to send delegates to the\r\nproposed Southern Congress.\" 3. Virginia appeals to South Carolina \"to\r\ndesist from any meditated secession upon her part, which can not but\r\ntend to the destruction of the Union, and the loss to all the States of\r\nthe blessings that spring from it.\" 4. Believing that the Constitution\r\nprovides adequate protection to the rights of all the States, Virginia\r\n\"invokes all who live under it to adhere more strictly to it, and to\r\npreserve inviolate the safeguards which it affords to the rights of\r\nindividual States, and the interests of sectional minorities.\" 5.\r\nReprobates all legislation or combinations designed to affect the\r\ninstitutions peculiar to the South, as derogatory and offensive to the\r\nSouthern States, and calculated to \"defeat the restoration of peaceful\r\nand harmonious sentiments in these States.\" These dignified and\r\ntemperate resolutions passed with singular unanimity: the 3d with but\r\nthree, the 1st with only one, and the 4th and 5th without a single\r\ndissenting voice, out of 118 members present and voting. They were\r\ndirected to be transmitted to the Executive of each of the States, with\r\nthe exception of Vermont. In the Senate an amendment was passed,\r\nomitting this exception of Vermont; but the House refusing, by a very\r\nclose vote, to concur, the Senate receded.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that these resolutions embody the prevalent\r\nsentiment of the South. The _Richmond Enquirer_, one of the ablest and\r\nmost influential Southern papers, affirms them to be \"such an expression\r\nof sentiment as will harmonize with the universal sentiment of the\r\nSouth, with rare exceptions. South Carolina,\" it goes on to say, \"still\r\nwears the front of resistance and war; and in a portion of Mississippi\r\nwe expect to hear of secret pledges of dark import, of maps, drawings,\r\nand lines of demarkation for a Southern Confederacy, of a President in\r\nembryo, foreign ministers in expectancy, and, in short, all the\r\nparaphernalia of a Southern Court. We have watched the Southern horizon\r\nwith a steady and keen eye, and with the slight exceptions alluded to\r\nabove, we can not but regard it as a fixed fact that the South has\r\nalready acquiesced in the Compromise measures.\"\r\n\r\nIn Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky, all the indications of\r\npublic sentiment are of the same tendency. In Missouri the State\r\nConvention has adopted an address and resolutions in favor of the course\r\npursued by Mr. Benton in opposition to those who are regarded as the\r\nenemies of the Union.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, the tone of the press and of public men is decidedly\r\nhostile to the Union. It is, however, a significant fact that the\r\nelection of delegates to the State Convention failed to draw out a third\r\nof the vote of the State. Col. ISAAC W. HAYNE, the Attorney-General of\r\nthe State, and member-elect from Charleston, of the State Convention,\r\nhas published a letter in which he laments this apathy on the part of\r\nthe voters. He affirms that any State has \"a right to withdraw from the\r\nUnion, with or without cause;\" that he has begun to \"loathe the tie\r\nwhich connects us with our miscalled brethren of the North.\" \"Not the\r\nvictims of the tyranny of Mezentius,\" he goes on to say, \"could have\r\nshrunk in more disgust from the unnatural union of warm and breathing\r\nlife with the rotting carcass of what had once been a brother man, than\r\nI do from this once cherished but now abhorred and forced connection.\"\r\nThe policy which he recommends, now that the occasion which the\r\n\"admission of California and the dismemberment of Texas\" might have\r\nafforded, has passed away unimproved is, \"to teach that disunion is a\r\nthing certain in the future; to direct, in contemplation of this, all\r\nthe energies of oar people first to preparation for a physical contest,\"\r\nand then \"to develop all our own resources, and cut off, as far as\r\npossible, all intercourse with the offending States. This done, to hold\r\nourselves ready to move on the first general ferment in the South,\r\nwhich, my life upon it, will occur full soon, and in the meanwhile, to\r\ncultivate the kindest relations, and to keep up, industriously and with\r\nsystem, the closest intercourse with our sister States of the South.\"\r\n\r\nA letter from Senator PHELPS of Vermont to a member of the Virginia\r\nLegislature, respecting the Vermont law in relation to fugitives,\r\nappears in the Southern papers. It bears date in January, but we believe\r\nit is now first published. He gives it as his opinion that the law of\r\nVermont, of which a synopsis may be found in our January Number, was\r\npassed in haste, and without due consideration, and does not embody the\r\ndeliberate sense of the people or of the legislative body of that State.\r\nHe affirms that the entire Congressional delegation of the State agree\r\nwith him in deprecating its passage; and expresses the opinion that it\r\nwill be repealed at the next session of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nChevalier HULSEMANN, the Austrian Chargé, in reply to the famous\r\ndispatch of Mr. Webster, says that the opinions of his Government remain\r\nunaltered with respect to the mission of Mr. Mann; but that it \"declines\r\nall ulterior discussion of that annoying incident,\" from unwillingness\r\nto disturb its friendly relations with the United States. Austria has\r\nnot demanded, and will not demand any thing beyond the putting in\r\npractice the principles of non-intervention announced by President\r\nFillmore; and is \"sincerely disposed to remain in friendly relations\r\nwith the Government of the United States so long as the United States\r\nshall not deviate from those principles.\" Mr. WEBSTER, in reply, states\r\nthat the President regrets that the dispatch was unsatisfactory, but is\r\ngratified to learn that the Imperial Government desires to continue the\r\npresent friendly relations; and also that it approves the sentiments\r\nexpressed in his Message, in accordance with which he intends to act. He\r\nsays that the Government of the United States is equally disinclined to\r\nprolong the discussion; but declares that the principles and policy\r\navowed by the United States are \"fixed and fastened upon them by their\r\ncharacter, their history, and their position among the nations of the\r\nworld; and it may be regarded as certain that these principles and this\r\npolicy will not be abandoned or departed from until some extraordinary\r\nchange shall take place in the general current of human affairs.\"\r\n\r\nAMIN BEY, the Turkish Commissioner, in taking leave of the President,\r\npreparatory to returning to his own country, read an address expressing\r\nhis appreciation of the courtesy shown him upon his visit, and his sense\r\nof the progress and resources of this country. He carries with him to\r\nConstantinople many valuable works, presented by Government and by\r\nprivate liberality, relating to the agriculture, industry, and commerce\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nIn Ohio the Constitutional Convention closed its labors on the 10th of\r\nMarch, having been in session nearly six months. The Constitution which\r\nthey framed is to be voted upon on the third Tuesday in June. It\r\nembraces 16 articles, divided into 168 sections. It provides for freedom\r\nof religion, equality of political rights, trial by jury, the _habeas\r\ncorpus_, freedom of speech and of the press, and no imprisonment for\r\ndebt. The right of suffrage is vested in all free white male adult\r\ncitizens. All patronage is taken from the General Assembly; judicial and\r\nexecutive officers are to be elected by the people; and the public\r\nprinting to be given to the lowest responsible bidder. No new county can\r\nbe formed without the sanction of the majority of voters in all the\r\ncounties of which the boundaries would be changed. Provision is made for\r\nthe liquidation of the State debt; and no new debt can be created by the\r\nGeneral Assembly except in case of war or insurrection, or to a limited\r\namount to meet any temporary deficiency; and funds borrowed for these\r\npurposes can be used for no other. No special act of incorporation can\r\nbe granted; but a general law, subject to alteration or repeal, may be\r\npassed, under which associations may be formed. The General Assembly is\r\nprohibited from assuming the debt of any county, town, or city; from\r\nloaning the credit of the State to, or becoming a stockholder on any\r\ncorporation or association. No divorce can be granted by the\r\nLegislature. An article prohibiting licenses for the sale of\r\nintoxicating liquors is to be separately voted upon. Provision is made\r\nfor law reform, and for amendments to the Constitution from time to\r\ntime. Every twenty years the question of a Constitutional Convention is\r\nto be submitted to vote. The details of the legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial systems, are not essentially different from those which\r\ngenerally prevail.\r\n\r\nIn Virginia a Constitutional Convention is now in session. It is at\r\npresent occupied in discussing the question of the basis of\r\nrepresentation. The section of the State east of the Blue Ridge, with\r\nabout four-ninths of the free population, pays nearly two-thirds of the\r\ntaxes. They desire that one half of the representatives should be\r\napportioned in the ratio of the voters; and the other half in that of\r\ntaxation; which would secure the preponderance to the eastern section.\r\nThe west demand that representation shall be in the ratio of the voters,\r\nwhich would give the political supremacy to their portion of the State.\r\nThe debates have been protracted and exciting.\r\n\r\nThe frontiers of Texas continue to be harassed by marauding parties of\r\nIndians. An expedition has been fitted out to bring them to terms.\r\n\r\nThe little village of Socorro, in New Mexico, has been the scene of a\r\nfearful tragedy. A band of desperadoes had gradually collected there,\r\nwho indulged in the most wanton acts of outrage and barbarity, upon the\r\nMexican residents, finally ending in more than one deliberate murder. A\r\nfew members of the Boundary Commission who had been left there, headed\r\nan organization which captured a number of the gang, of whom three were\r\ntried and hung on the spot. The ringleader, who had made his escape, was\r\nsoon after taken, and shared the same fate.\r\n\r\nFrom California we have intelligence up to the 5th of March. The amount\r\nof gold received during the month, exclusive of that in the hands of\r\npassengers is about $1,817,000. The production continues abundant;\r\nthough the profits of agriculture are represented to be quite equal, and\r\nmore sure, than those of mining. Hostilities with the Indians still\r\ncontinue. Another engagement has taken place, in which 40 of the Indians\r\nwere killed, without loss on the part of the whites. In Sacramento City,\r\na gambler engaged in a brawl, shot down a citizen who attempted to\r\nprevent outrage. The murderer was seized by the populace, tried by Lynch\r\nlaw, found guilty, and in spite of the efforts of some citizens, hung\r\nfrom the branch of a tree, within a few hours of the commission of the\r\nmurder. In San Francisco two men came near sharing a similar fate for an\r\nattempt at murder and robbery. They were, however, finally rescued from\r\nthe populace, and handed over to the civil authority. No Senator has\r\nbeen elected. The Legislature met in joint convention; but after 144\r\nballots, finding no probability of succeeding in making an election,\r\nadjourned _sine die_. The whole number of votes cast was 49; thus making\r\n25 necessary for a choice. The highest number for Mr. Frémont was 16.\r\nMr. Heydenfeldt, formerly of Alabama, was for a time the leading\r\nDemocratic candidate. He was opposed by a portion of his party, on the\r\nalleged ground of having formerly advocated disunion. This is denied by\r\nhimself and his friends. Mr. Weller was subsequently taken up; and at\r\nthe last ballot received 18 votes. The Whig candidate throughout was Mr.\r\nKing, whose highest vote was 20.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEXICO.\r\n\r\nFrom Mexico the general aspect of intelligence is gloomy enough. It\r\nwould seem doubtful whether there is sufficient vitality left for the\r\nre-organization of society, without an infusion of a more fresh and\r\nvigorous blood. The administration of Arista has not thus far realized\r\nthe anticipations which had been cherished of it. The country is\r\ninfested with predatory Indians and brigands. On the 15th of February, a\r\ntrain of wagons was attacked in broad daylight, a few miles from the\r\ncapital, by a band of 15 robbers who drove off the military escort and\r\ncarried away a large amount of goods. The Minister of War and Marine\r\nurges the establishment of military colonies upon the frontiers; and\r\nrecommends the desperate measure of incorporating into these colonies\r\nthe agricultural Indians, such as the Seminoles, who are accustomed to\r\nthe use of arms, and are disposed to settle in fixed habitations, so\r\nthat they may serve as a barrier against the marauding Camanches,\r\nLipanes, and Apaches. The highroad leading from Mazatlan to the mines is\r\nheld by the Indians. In Yucatan fears are entertained of the\r\nextermination of the whites. The refractory Bishop of Michoacan has at\r\nlength consented to take the oath to sustain the constitution and laws.\r\nAn act of the Legislature of Queretaro, restoring the Jesuits to that\r\nState, has been pronounced by Congress to be a violation of the\r\nConstitution. The exclusive right for 100 years to construct a railroad\r\nfrom Vera Cruz to Madellan has been granted to Don José Maria Estellan.\r\n\r\n\r\nGREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\nOur last Record closed amidst the unsuccessful attempts to find somebody\r\nwho would undertake to carry on the government of the country. Stanley\r\nand Russell, the representatives of the Free-trade and Protection\r\nparties, felt too weak. Gladstone would not help Stanley, nor Graham\r\nhelp Russell; and nobody would help Lord Aberdeen. At last the advice of\r\nthe Duke of Wellington was solicited; in accordance with which the\r\nformer Ministry were invited to resume their places. They left office on\r\nthe 22d of February because they were unable to obtain the confidence of\r\nthe House, and resumed on the 3d of March, under the pressure of the\r\nsame inability, every man his old office. At a meeting of the members of\r\nthe House who usually supported him, summoned by Lord John Russell, he\r\nannounced, among other measures, that it was the determination of the\r\nGovernment to proceed with the Ecclesiastical Titles Bill, with certain\r\nmodifications. This aroused vehement remonstrances from a number of\r\nCatholic Whigs, who announced their determination to oppose the Ministry\r\nat all hazards. When the bill came to be presented, it was found that\r\nall that remained was the prohibition for Catholic bishops to assume\r\ntitles derived from the name of any place in the United Kingdom. Dr.\r\nWiseman must not call himself Archbishop of Westminster, or Dr. M'Hale\r\nsign himself \"John of Tuam,\" under penalty of £100, if Government should\r\nhave the folly to prosecute. Meanwhile they may address each other by\r\nthese titles, and all Catholics may consider and address them so\r\nunharmed. The bill, as modified passed to a second reading on the 22d of\r\nMarch, by 438 ayes to 95 nays--a majority of more than four to one. Such\r\nis the _finale_ of the absurd and disproportionate agitation with\r\nrespect to the \"Papal Agression.\" Nobody is satisfied. The Church party,\r\nwho mourned over the shortcomings of the bill as originally presented,\r\nare of course still less pleased with it as emasculated. The Catholics\r\nwho then opposed it as an injury, now resent it as an insult.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry has sustained a series of annoying defeats and checks on\r\nunimportant measures; and have therefore kept back all the leading\r\nbusiness, such as the presentation of the Budget. The Protection and\r\nFree-trade parties are mustering their strength throughout the country,\r\npreparatory to a general election, which will probably take place at the\r\nclose of the present session.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing crime at present seems to be poisoning by arsenic. Wives\r\npoison their husbands, husbands their wives, and servants both. A bill\r\nhas has been introduced by Lord Carlisle prohibiting the sale of arsenic\r\nexcept in the presence of a witness, who with the purchaser, are to\r\nregister their names in a book. It is also proposed to enact that all\r\narsenic sold shall be mixed with substances which by their taste or\r\ncolor will give warning of its presence.\r\n\r\nAn insurrection has broken out among the Kaffirs at the Cape, which\r\npromises to be annoying and expensive. The ultimate cause is the gradual\r\nexpulsion of the savages, which always follows the colonization of their\r\nterritories by civilized nations. Thousands are driven from their lands,\r\nand compressed into a space only sufficient for scores, and begin to\r\nthink it as well to die fighting as starving. The Governor at the Cape\r\nhaving formally deposed and outlawed one of the powerful native chiefs,\r\ndispatched an expedition to seize his person. This body of troops,\r\nconsisting of 600 men, was attacked in a narrow defile by the Kaffirs,\r\nand suffered some loss. Attacks were then made upon three of the\r\nfrontier settlements, and the colonists, to the number of 70 massacred.\r\nA levy _en masse_ of all males between the ages of eighteen and fifty\r\nwas summoned by the Governor, \"to destroy and exterminate those most\r\nbarbarous and treacherous savages, who for the moment are formidable.\"\r\nSeveral smart engagements have taken place, in which the savages, though\r\nworsted, displayed great daring, and considerable skill and discipline.\r\n\r\nAttention has been called in Parliament to the proceedings of the\r\nvarious Revolutionary Committees composed of foreign refugees, and\r\nheaded by Mazzini, Ledru-Rollin, and Klapka. Their proceedings were\r\ncharged with being a violation of the obligations they incurred when\r\nthey came to seek the protection of English laws. Members of Government\r\nexpressed their decided disapprobation of the course pursued by the\r\nrefugees in endeavoring to excite insurrection in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nA Miss Talbot, heiress to a fortune of £80,000, has entered a convent as\r\n\"postulant\" with the intention of taking the vail in a few months, when\r\nit is supposed that her fortune will pass to the church. This has\r\noccasioned some excitement against convents, and a bill has been\r\nintroduced intended to prevent the forcible detention of females in\r\nhouses in which the inmates are bound by religious or monastic vows. It\r\nprovides that all such establishments shall be registered, and subject\r\nto semi-annual visitation by public officers, who shall have power to\r\nremove any female who desires it. Concealment of any part of the\r\npremises, or of any person therein, false lists of the inmates, and any\r\nobstruction to the visitors, are to be punished as misdemeanors.\r\nMeasures are also proposed regulating legacies made for religious\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nAt Chelmsford a man and woman were hung for murder, attended by the\r\nusual disgraceful accompaniments of a public execution. Crowds gathered\r\nfrom all the surrounding country; at the moment of execution 40,000 or\r\n50,000 persons are said to have been present. Venders of edibles plied\r\ntheir vocation in the most gross and revolting manner; pickpockets, as\r\nusual, were in attendance, and the general deportment of the spectators,\r\nmen, women, and children, was disgusting and brutal. The man confessed\r\nhis guilt. The woman, whose crime was poisoning with arsenic, died\r\nprotesting her innocence.\r\n\r\n\"A monster address\" signed by 61 noblemen, 110 members of the House of\r\nCommons, and 321,240 other persons, lay members of the church of\r\nEngland, has been presented by Lord Ashley to the Queen. It beseeches\r\nher Majesty to resist the Papal aggression; and goes on to speak of that\r\nact having been occasioned and invited by the conduct of many of the\r\nclergy of the church of England, who have shown a desire to assimilate\r\nthe doctrines of their church to those of Rome. After specifying the\r\nsacramental system and \"histrionic arrangements\" in the churches, it\r\nsays that \"by the constitution and existing laws, there is vested in\r\nyour Majesty as the earthly head of our Church, a wholesome power of\r\ninterposition, which power we entreat your Majesty now to exercise.\"\r\n\r\nCharges have been made in the House of Commons against Lord Torrington,\r\nlate Governor of Ceylon. He is accused of gross misgovernment, wanton\r\ncruelty in suppressing native insurrection, and the production of false\r\nevidence. Lord John Russell announced that he should postpone the Budget\r\nand the Income Tax, until this charge, which was in effect one against\r\nGovernment, had been disposed of. Upon which the mover announced that he\r\nshould postpone his motion until after the introduction of these\r\nmeasures. Lord Torrington, in the House of Lords, came forward and\r\nchallenged the prosecution of these charges.\r\n\r\nA coal-pit disaster occurred near Glasgow, involving a terrible loss of\r\nlife. While 63 men and boys were at work in the mine, an explosion of\r\nfire-damp occurred. Of those in the mine all but two perished.\r\n\r\nA searching investigation is going on into the adulterations of articles\r\nof food. It is asserted that there is scarcely an article which is in\r\nany way susceptible of mixture, that is not mingled with others not\r\nmerely of inferior value, but in many cases of the most loathsome and\r\ndisgusting nature. Ground coffee is specified as particularly subject to\r\nadulteration.\r\n\r\nA somewhat singular controversy has arisen in reference to a body of\r\nrefugees from Hungary, who have recently arrived at Liverpool. They\r\nnumber 262, of whom the majority are Poles, the remnant of the Polish\r\nlegion in Hungary. Government wishes to send them to America, and offers\r\na bounty of £8, to each man who will go. They wish to remain in England,\r\nevidently anticipating an uprising in some part of Europe, where their\r\nservices may be called into requisition. They are entirely destitute of\r\nmeans of support, and in England can only maintain themselves by\r\nbegging.\r\n\r\nThe frigate St. Lawrence, having on board the contributions to the\r\nExhibition from the United States, arrived at Portsmouth on the 13th of\r\nMarch. A meeting of the American exhibitors has been held at London, at\r\nwhich great dissatisfaction was expressed with many of the arrangements.\r\nThey object in particular to the appointment of jurors to decide upon\r\nthe merits of foreign productions; to bronze medals being awarded as\r\nprizes, when more valuable ones had been promised; to the high price of\r\nseason tickets; to contributors being compelled to pay for admission,\r\nand be at the expense of their own fittings; and to the delay in\r\naffording protection to the articles which require a patent. Some\r\nleakage has occurred in the roof of the Exhibition Building; but it is\r\nhoped that it may be obviated. All opinion adverse to the suitability of\r\nthe painting of the interior has passed away. The theoretical views of\r\nthe decorator have been abundantly justified by the practical effect.\r\n\r\nAnother expedition in search of Sir John Franklin is to be fitted out\r\nthis season. The little \"Prince Albert\" is to be sent out, it is hoped,\r\nunder happier auspices than attended her former voyage. It is expected\r\nto reach Lancaster Sound, by the middle of June. The vessel will be laid\r\nup for wintering in Prince Regent's Inlet. The party will then proceed\r\nin boats as far as practicable. When these can no longer be worked,\r\nnative \"kyacks\" will be used, which will enable the explorers to reach a\r\npoint some one or two hundred miles further than boats could carry them,\r\nas the kyacks can be hauled up and dragged over the ice. The expedition\r\nwill remain out for at least one season; and a very extensive search to\r\nthe westward of Boothia is proposed. It will be under the command of\r\nCapt. W. Kennedy, who has had no small experience in these icy regions.\r\nWe do not learn whether Mr. Snow, from whose interesting book we copied\r\nso largely last month, is to be attached to this new expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANCE.\r\n\r\nThe most striking incident which has occurred since our last has been a\r\ndebate on a proposition to repeal the law exiling the Bourbon family. M.\r\nBerryer, acting in the name of the Legitimists, opposed the motion on\r\nthe ground that the Count of Chambord is not an exiled Frenchman, but an\r\nextruded king, who could not stoop to accept a permission to re-enter\r\nhis own hereditary dominions. M. Thiers, as the organ of the Orleanists,\r\nadvocated the proposition. The Minister of Justice, in the name of\r\nGovernment, was favorable to the principle of the bill, but was opposed\r\nto pressing it at present. The Assembly was thrown into violent\r\nagitation by a speech from M. Dufraisse, one of the most able and\r\nearnest of the Montagnards, who delivered a speech which would not have\r\nbeen misplaced in the mouth of Robespierre or Danton. \"The pale head,\r\ncompressed lips, and intense expression of the young lawyer of the\r\nMountain,\" says an eyewitness, \"reminded the auditors, not without a\r\nshudder, of such a thoroughbred Jacobin as St. Just.\" He declared that\r\nthe laws of proscription were just, and ought to be maintained. \"The\r\nRevolution can not ask pardon of the dynasties it has justly upset. Have\r\nthe family of Orleans laid aside the claims of their birth? Have they\r\nrendered homage to the sovereignty of the nation? Do not the descendants\r\nof St. Louis continually dispute the independence and the conquests of\r\nthe people? You tell us that royalty never dies; we reply, Nor does its\r\npunishment. If the principle of sovereignty is eternal, so shall its\r\npunishment be eternal. The law ought to chastise the voluntary\r\nrepresentatives, the willing heirs of a principle which the people have\r\nabolished.\" He went on to vindicate the execution of Louis XVI., and\r\ndeclared that those who voted against the death of that monarch,\r\nmeditated a return to royalty, and reminded the Assembly that among\r\nthose who voted for the execution, was the grandfather of the princes\r\nwhose banishment was sought to be repealed. The speech caused a perfect\r\nstorm of passion in the Assembly. Members rushed to the tribune, and\r\nshook their fists in the speaker's face. M. Berryer proposed the\r\nadjournment of the question for six months, as he could not vote on the\r\nsame side with those who advocated such doctrines. This, which is looked\r\nupon as equivalent to a rejection of the proposition, was carried by\r\nacclamation.\r\n\r\nRumors have for some time been rife of an intended fusion between the\r\nBourbon and Orleans interests, with a view to a speedy restoration of\r\nthe monarchy. These would seem to be put to rest by a letter from the\r\nOrleans princes in England to the Orleans Committee in Paris, in which\r\nthey declare that they will negotiate only on the soil of France, and\r\nwhile out of their country will take no part in political questions. The\r\nprolongation of the term of the President is urged in many quarters as\r\nthe only practicable safeguard against socialism and anarchy. The\r\npresent aspect of affairs seems to indicate that he will be continued in\r\noffice in some shape or other.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Chartres, in a pastoral letter, attacks a late circular of\r\nthe Archbishop of Paris, recommending the clergy to abstain from\r\npolitics, and to yield obedience to the laws of their country. The\r\nbishop considers that when destructive principles are advanced, the\r\nclergy should be found ready to oppose their progress; and he sees no\r\nreason why the ecclesiastical body should be enjoined to take no part in\r\npublic affairs. The archbishop, in reply, denounces the conduct of the\r\nbishop, as an unwarrantable interference with his jurisdiction, and as a\r\nbreach of the respect due to him as metropolitan: and refers the\r\nbishop's letter to the provincial council to be held during the present\r\nyear at Paris.\r\n\r\nThe Professors of the College of France held a meeting at the Sorbonne\r\nto take into consideration the tendency of the lectures of M. Michelet,\r\nwhich were considered prejudicial, in a moral and political point of\r\nview to the students. He himself declined to attend, but defended\r\nhimself in a letter stating that his lectures were blamed only by the\r\nJesuits and the enemies of French nationality. His colleagues, by a vote\r\nof 17 out of 21 decided upon a vote of censure against him, and that the\r\nminutes of their proceedings should be transmitted to the Minister for\r\napproval. It is said that M. Michelet his resigned his chair.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMANY.\r\n\r\nThe German mists grow thicker. All that can now be affirmed with\r\ncertainty is, that the Dresden Conference has been no more able to\r\nimprovise a German Empire than was the Frankfort Parliament. A month\r\nago, and it seemed that Austria had outgeneraled Prussia, and made\r\nherself absolute mistress of Germany, and was in a fair way to become\r\nruler from the Rhine to the Alps. The petty states of Germany were in\r\nalarm; the kingdoms of the second rank began to see themselves in\r\ndanger, and to talk of a central power, from which the constitutional\r\nelement was not altogether excluded. It is now said that the King of\r\nPrussia is again ambitious of playing the first part on the German\r\nstage, and has refused to sanction the concessions made by his minister.\r\nIt seems probable that Germany will fall back upon the old Frankfort\r\nConfederation. In the mean time, we present the following, as what seems\r\nto us the condition and designs of the principal parties; premising that\r\nthe very next intelligence may present them under an altogether new\r\naspect:--Austria wishes to enter the Germanic Confederation with all her\r\nvast and heterogeneous population; thus binding all Germany to assist\r\nher, in the event of any new Hungarian or Italian outbreak. She also\r\nwishes to secure the Federal Executive. If she succeeds in these\r\nprojects, the weight of her foreign possessions gives her the\r\npreponderance in Germany, while Germany secures to her the control of\r\nher foreign territories. The interests of the people and princes of\r\nGermany for once coincide in opposing this claim. The vacillating policy\r\nof Prussia has arisen from doubt, whether more could be made out of\r\nAustria by putting herself at the head of the German States, or out of\r\nthese States, by joining with Austria. The ultimate decision of this\r\nquestion is more likely to be effected by accident than by settled\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\n\r\nITALY.\r\n\r\nThe feelings of uneasiness, and vague apprehension of insurrection\r\nthroughout the Italian Peninsula are nowise abated. Austrian troops are\r\nconcentrating within her Italian territories. The railroad across the\r\nMilan Alps, from Cilly to Trieste, is advancing with great rapidity. The\r\ncompletion of this road will enable Austrian troops to be sent from\r\nVienna to Milan in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Government has issued an ordonnance directing that in those\r\nparts of Italy which are still considered in a state of siege, no\r\njournal shall mention in any way, directly or indirectly, the titles of\r\nthe prohibited revolutionary books and pamphlets which are in\r\ncirculation among the people.\r\n\r\nRadetzky has issued a proclamation, under date of Feb. 21, from Verona,\r\ndirected against revolutionary proclamations and pamphlets, threatening\r\ndeath against all who are engaged in circulating them. Every one into\r\nwhose hands such a pamphlet may fall is directed to deliver it to the\r\nnearest person in office, though but a gendarme, and at the same time to\r\ndeclare how it came into his possession; the punishment for failure to\r\ndo this is imprisonment in irons for a period of from one to five years.\r\n\r\nWashington's Birthday was celebrated at Rome with great enthusiasm. At a\r\npublic dinner, Mr. Cass, our Chargé, presided and made a speech. Two\r\nodes, by Mrs. Stephens, were sung. Among the guests were Archbishop\r\nHughes, and Mr. Hastings, the American Protestant Chaplain. The report\r\nthat the American Protestant chapel at Rome had been closed is\r\nauthoritatively contradicted by Mr. Hastings, who speaks in terms of\r\nhigh praise of the liberality which has been manifested toward him by\r\nthe papal authorities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE, SCIENCE, ART, PERSONAL MOVEMENTS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition of the National Academy of Design is now open. It is\r\nuniversally admitted that the paintings surpass those of any previous\r\nyear The opening of the Exhibition was celebrated, according to custom,\r\nby a dinner, attended by artists, amateurs, and men of letters.\r\nAdmirable speeches were made by Rev. Doctors BELLOWS and BETHUNE, who,\r\nthough pole-wide apart in the sphere of theology, spanning the distance\r\nbetween Arius and Calvin, find common grounds of sympathy in their love\r\nfor, and appreciation of Art. Mr. DURAND, the President, in a very\r\nfelicitous speech, narrated his experience as an artist and as one of\r\nthe founders of the Academy.\r\n\r\nMr. GREENOUGH, at Florence, has nearly completed his group of the\r\n_Pioneer_, for the Capitol at Washington. It represents a backwoodsman\r\nrescuing his wife and child from an Indian who is in the act of\r\nsmothering them in the folds of his blanket. The action of the group\r\nsymbolizes the one unvarying story of the contest between civilized and\r\nuncivilized man. The pioneer, standing almost erect, in the pride of\r\nconscious superiority, has dashed upon one knee the Indian, whose\r\nrelaxed form, and cowering face upturned despairingly, express\r\npremonitions of the inevitable doom awaiting him, against which all his\r\nefforts would be unavailing. The heavy brow, compressed lip, and firm\r\nchin of the white man announce him one of a race born to conquer and\r\nrule, not so much by mere physical strength as by undaunted courage and\r\nindomitable will. Those who have seen the group pronounce it to be a\r\nsublime conception grandly executed.\r\n\r\nA portrait of Mr. Calhoun, painted at Paris by Mr. HEALEY for the Common\r\nCouncil of Charleston, was exhibited at the Exposition in Paris, where\r\nit was pronounced one of the best portraits of the season. The size is\r\nseven feet ten inches, by four feet seven. The sum paid for it is one\r\nthousand dollars. We believe it has been forwarded to Charleston.\r\n\r\nAmong the pictures by our artists, completed or in progress, we notice\r\none by Mr. WRIGHT, representing the well-known story of Washington and\r\nthe damaged cherry-tree, which is executed with decided cleverness.--Mr.\r\nDUGGAN is engaged upon a David and Goliath, one of those massy subjects\r\naffording ample scope for the bent of the artist's genius.--Mr. STEARNS\r\nhas upon his easel a painting of the Interview between Tecumseh and\r\nGeneral Harrison, at Vincennes, in 1811. By some oversight no seat had\r\nbeen provided for the Indian chief. The unintentional discourtesy was\r\ncorrected by General Harrison, with the words, \"Warrior, your father,\r\nGeneral Harrison, offers you a seat.\" Tecumseh drew up his stately form\r\nto its full height, and raising his hand to heaven, exclaimed proudly,\r\n\"My father! The Great Spirit is my father, and the Earth my mother; she\r\nfeeds me and clothes me, and I recline upon her bosom!\"--Mr. T. A.\r\nRICHARDS has recently completed a painting which might appropriately\r\nenough be named \"Recollections of Lake Winnipiseogee,\" portraying rather\r\nthe general characteristics of that lake, than depicting the particular\r\nfeatures of any one portion. The scene is an autumn morning, with the\r\nsun bursting forth from the train of a passing shower which has\r\nsprinkled diamonds over foliage and flower.\r\n\r\nJENNY LIND is verging New York-ward. Her next concert here is announced\r\nfor May 12. The New York firemen have procured a testimonial to be\r\npresented to her in acknowledgment of her munificent donation of $3000\r\nto the funds of the Department. It consists of a complete copy of\r\nAudubon's Birds and Quadrupeds of America, in a beautiful case; and a\r\ngold box, appropriately ornamented, containing a copy of their vote of\r\nthanks to her. The following ratherish pretty and altogether German\r\nlines were contributed by her to the album of a gentleman in Washington;\r\n\r\n    \"In vain I seek for rest\r\n      In all created good.\r\n    It leaves me still unblest,\r\n      And makes me cry for God.\r\n    And sure, at rest I can not be\r\n    Until my heart finds rest in thee.\"\r\n\r\nThe renowned TUPPER is undergoing the process of lionization. He has\r\nintroduced a new feature into his representation of the part, by the\r\nrecitation in public of his own verses. He has produced for the Great\r\nLondon Exhibition a \"Hymn for all Nations,\" which is to be translated\r\ninto thirty different languages, set to music, and printed. This\r\npolyglott will be a philological curiosity, if no more.\r\n\r\nMr. CRALLE, the intimate friend and confidential secretary of Mr.\r\nCALHOUN, is engaged in preparing for publication the Works of the great\r\nsouthern statesman, to be accompanied by a Biography. The whole will be\r\ncomprised, probably, in six octavo volumes. The first volume, which is\r\nnow printed, and will soon be ready for publication, is occupied by an\r\nelaborate disquisition on Government, and a Discourse on the\r\nConstitution and Government of the United States. These treatises have\r\nalways been spoken of as the \"great work\" of Mr. Calhoun's life, setting\r\nforth in a systematic manner his views upon the philosophy of civil\r\ngovernment. The treatises were commenced many years since, but never\r\nreceived the final revision and correction which the author intended to\r\nbestow upon them.\r\n\r\nThe Complete Works of ALEXANDER HAMILTON are now in course of\r\npublication by C. S. Francis & Co. They are mainly printed from the\r\nmanuscripts purchased by Congress, under the direction of the Library\r\nCommittee. The collection will extend to seven octavo volumes.\r\n\r\nIt has long been suspected that colors were depicted on Daguerreotype\r\nplates, if they could only be developed. Mr. HILL, of this State,\r\nannounces that he has succeeded in producing pictures in which every\r\ntint and shade is accurately represented. We are assured by one of our\r\nmost eminent operators, one of the very few who have seen the pictures,\r\nthat there is no doubt of the fact. The inventor as yet keeps his\r\nprocess a secret, though we understand that he is preparing a memoir in\r\nrelation to it.\r\n\r\nBAYARD TAYLOR'S El-Dorado has been translated into German by C. Hartman,\r\nauthor of a Geographical and Historical Description of California.\r\n\r\nMr. SAMUEL MAVERICK, of Pendleton, S. C., who is still living, assisted\r\nin packing the first bale of cotton ever sent from the United States to\r\nLiverpool. It was sent in the seed, and the consignee informed his South\r\nCarolina correspondent that the article was useless, could not be sold,\r\nand advised him to send no more.\r\n\r\nDr. GOADBY, who has recently delivered in this city a very interesting\r\ncourse of lectures upon insects, has a most valuable series of\r\ndissections, prepared at a cost of labor which would seem almost\r\nincredible. The anatomy of a caterpillar, comprising three distinct\r\npreparations--its nervous system, its organs of respiration, and its\r\norgans of nutrition--occupied the undivided labor of thirteen weeks, at\r\nthe rate of fourteen hours a day.\r\n\r\nGen. HENDERSON, who was on trial at New Orleans on the charge of being\r\nimplicated in the Cuban invasion, has been discharged, the jury being\r\nunable to agree. The District Attorney therefore entered a _nolle\r\nprosequi_ in the case of Governor Quitman and all others under\r\nindictment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN.\r\n\r\nThe new Leipzig _Deutsches Museum_ (Westermann Brothers, New York,)\r\npromises to meet the want which we have for some time found it\r\nimpossible to supply, of a German literary Magazine. In the recent\r\nrevolutionary storms this class of periodicals generally went down, so\r\nthat for information as to the working of the German mind we have been\r\nforced to rely upon chance notices in the political journals, or trust\r\nto foreign sources. It is published semi-monthly. Its cost in Leipzig is\r\n12 _Thalers_; and is furnished here for the same number of dollars.\r\n\r\nUnder the title of _Causeries du Lundi_ M. St. Beauve has just put forth\r\na volume of sketches of contemporary French authors, which almost forces\r\nus to envy the happy land blessed with such a number of men, the worst\r\nof whom exceeds our ideas of any attainable height of perfection. A word\r\nor two of criticism is awarded to Lamartine, but too bland to wound even\r\nthe vanity of the gentle Alphonse. But Girardin and Villemain, Cousin\r\nand George Sand, Thiers and Montalembert receive a most unqualified\r\napotheosis. The title of \"Monday Chat\" simply indicates that the book is\r\nmade up of articles which appeared on Mondays in the _Constitutionnel_\r\nnewspaper.\r\n\r\nPictures by the \"Old Masters,\" as all the world knows, are manufactured\r\nas readily, and almost as extensively, as calico. It is not, however, so\r\nwell known that \"old and rare editions\" of books are produced nowadays.\r\nThe passion of book-collectors has given a new impulse to this business.\r\nWithin a few months the beautiful editions of the classics of the\r\nElzevirs and the Stephens have been reproduced with wonderful skill. In\r\npaper, type, ink, and binding there is no perceptible difference; while\r\nthe precise air of antiquity desired is produced by chemical means.\r\n\r\nM. Feuillet de Conches, a Parisian virtuoso, and great admirer of La\r\nFontaine, has spent a vast sum in having printed for his own sole use a\r\nsingle copy of the works of the famous fabulist. It is illustrated in\r\nthe most gorgeous style, by the first artists of the day; and is\r\naccompanied with notes and prefaces by the most eminent writers, and is\r\na very miracle of expensive typography and binding.\r\n\r\nVictor Hugo has published nothing for some years, having been paid by a\r\npublisher not to print. Report says that he will, at the close of his\r\nterm, which soon expires, make amends for his long silence by issuing\r\npoems to the amount of three volumes, and romances to that of twelve.\r\n\r\nA work by Origen, the celebrated Father in the Church, hitherto unknown,\r\nhas been discovered and published by the librarian of the National\r\nAssembly--so M. Villemain announced at a recent meeting of the _Académie\r\ndes Belles Lettres_ at Paris. The work traces the heresies of the third\r\ncentury to the writings of the Pagan Philosophers, and throws new light\r\nupon ancient manners, literature, and philosophy.\r\n\r\nIn the album presented to the King of Bavaria by the artists of Münich,\r\nis an admirable composition by Hübner. It is an expression of the\r\nfeelings of a large portion of Upper Germany. It represents a female\r\nprostrate upon the ground, with the arms crossed, the face entirely\r\nhidden, in an attitude of the deepest despair. The long hair floats\r\nover the arms, and trails along the ground. The whole figure is a\r\nmixture of majesty and utter abandonment. The simple title of the piece\r\nis--\"Germania, 1850.\"\r\n\r\n_Yeast: a Problem_, is the Sartor-Resartorish title of a collection of\r\npapers reprinted from Fraser's Magazine, where they have excited no\r\nlittle attention. It purports to be a sample of what is fermenting in\r\nthe minds of large classes of young men of the present day, and\r\nleavening the whole mass of society. Though published anonymously, it is\r\nknown to be written by the author of \"Alton Locke,\" and partakes largely\r\nof the merits and defects of that remarkable work. It is to be\r\nrepublished by the Harpers.\r\n\r\nIn WALTER SAVAGE LANDOR the material for an admirable newspaper writer\r\nhas been thrown away. Witness the following double-handed hitting in a\r\nletter to Lord Duncan, who lately won a victory over the Ministers, \"...\r\nA quarrel about hats, caps, and stockings, and the titles they confer,\r\nis too ridiculous. Is a hunchback to be treated with gravity, with\r\nseverity, because an ignorant rabble calls him _my lord_. If I chose to\r\ncall myself Lord Duncan, I should only be laughed at. People would\r\nstare; some would ask, 'Is this the great Lord Duncan who won the Battle\r\nof Camperdown?' Others would answer, 'No; nor is it he who won as great\r\na one in Westminster the other day. He is an impostor: haul him out; but\r\ndon't hurt him:' I have the honor to be, etc.\"\r\n\r\n_Dahomey and the Dahomans_, by Frederick E. Forbes, gives an interesting\r\naccount, drawn from personal observation, made during the last two\r\nyears, of the manners and customs of this savage people. Among the most\r\nrevolting is the _Ek-que-noo-ah-toh-meh_ or \"Throwing of Presents,\" in\r\nwhich the king occupies himself for many hours in throwing gifts from a\r\nraised platform, to the people below. The last of these gifts consists\r\nof a number of live prisoners, who have been exhibited bound upon the\r\nplatform; they are flung down to be cut and torn in pieces by the\r\nsavages. On the occasion when the author was present there were fourteen\r\nof these victims, of whom he succeeded in saving the lives of three. The\r\nobject of the expedition was to induce the king to abandon the\r\nslave-trade, and was altogether unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n_The Dynamical Theory of the Formation of the Earth,_ two mighty octavo\r\nvolumes, elicits the following complimentary remarks from the\r\n_Athenæum._ \"This work is saved from being mischievous only by the\r\ncircumstance of the excessive dullness diffused over these twelve\r\nhundred pages--which will in all probability prevent their being much\r\nread.... Of no one department of science does the author appear to have\r\na correct conception. His views are all distorted. He is false alike in\r\nhis Mechanics, in his Geology, in his Natural History, in his Chemistry,\r\nin his Electricity--in every other consideration of the physical\r\nagencies, and still more false in that which we suppose we must bring\r\nourselves to call his Logic.\"\r\n\r\n_Memoirs of a Literary Veteran_, by R. P. Gillies is a book almost worth\r\nreading, quite worth looking at. The author, nephew to the celebrated\r\nhistorian of Greece, born to a fair estate, and with a propensity to\r\nmake verses, spent the one without turning the other to any special\r\naccount. Amidst much idle matter, whose only purpose is to swell the\r\nbulk of the volumes, are some rather interesting anecdotes of literary\r\ncelebrities. Some over-laudatory epistles from Sir Egerton Brydges, and\r\na characteristic letter or two from Wordsworth, containing among other\r\nmatters, a criticism upon Scott's Guy Mannering, in which considerable\r\npraise is awarded to the management of \"this lady,\" as he solemnly\r\ndenominates Meg Merrilies, are perhaps the best things in the book. It\r\nreminds one, but at a wide interval, of Leigh Hunt's Autobiography.\r\n\r\n_A Life of Hartley Coleridge_ prefixed to a volume of his poems, tells a\r\nsad story of powers neutralized and a life thrown away. He was the\r\neldest son of _the_ Coleridge, and with a portion of his father's genius\r\ncombined a large share of his infirmity of purpose and feebleness of\r\nwill. He gained a college fellowship, and forfeited it within a year, by\r\nintemperance; after which he maintained himself by his pen. The Life is\r\nby his brother, Derwent Coleridge. The Poems are of decided merit. They\r\nare to be followed by a collection of his prose writings.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBITUARIES.\r\n\r\nISAAC HILL, formerly Governor of New Hampshire, and Senator in Congress,\r\ndied at Washington, March 22d, aged about 63. He was born at\r\nCharlestown, N. H., the son of a farmer, and at an early age learned the\r\ntrade of a printer. He established the first Democratic paper at\r\nConcord. To his able conduct is in a great measure to be ascribed the\r\nascendency which his party acquired in the State, about the year 1828.\r\nThough possessing few of the external qualifications for a popular\r\nleader, being feeble in person, and altogether destitute of oratorical\r\npower, his unrivaled tact and untiring industry gave him an uncontrolled\r\ninfluence in the State. He was chosen State Senator; and subsequently\r\nUnited States Senator, which office he held from 1831 to 1836, when he\r\nresigned, in consequence of having been elected Governor of New\r\nHampshire. He filled the executive chair for two or three terms, and\r\nthen retired to private life. In 1840 he was appointed Sub-Treasurer at\r\nBoston; but the repeal of the Sub-Treasury Act the following year\r\nvacated his office. He then returned to New Hampshire; but his star had\r\nwaned. He disagreed with his party on the subject of corporations and\r\nother radical questions, lost his political influence, and fell into\r\ncomparative insignificance, as a politician, though he always adhered to\r\nhis party. For a number of years he edited an agricultural paper of\r\nconsiderable merit. He suffered much from impaired health during the\r\nlast years of his life; and died in moderate pecuniary circumstances.\r\n\r\nMORDECAI MANASSEH NOAH, long known as an able editor and active\r\npolitician, died in New York, March 28. He was born at Philadelphia,\r\nJuly 19, 1784, and has thus attained to within three years of three\r\nscore and ten. He was apprenticed to a carver and gilder; but early\r\nabandoned that trade and devoted himself to literature and politics. He\r\nremoved to Charleston, S. C., in the early part of the present century,\r\nwhere he took an active and influential part in public affairs. Having\r\ndeclined the offer of the consulship at Riga, he was appointed, in 1813,\r\nconsul at Tunis, and was charged with a mission to Algiers. This latter\r\nhe accomplished, after some adventures, and repaired to Tunis. At the\r\nexpiration of ten months he was recalled, under charge, we believe, of\r\nsome pecuniary defalcations. Upon his return to this country, he became\r\nconnected with the political press. In 1822, he was elected Sheriff of\r\nthe City and County of New York, which office he held but a single year.\r\nIn 1829, he was appointed Commissioner of the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, and Surveyor of the port of New York. In the mean while,\r\nhe had formed the project of collecting his brethren the Jews, and\r\nrebuilding the city of Jerusalem. He issued a singular proclamation,\r\nappointing Grand Island, near Niagara Falls, as the place of rendezvous,\r\nand summoned the scattered tribes to transmit their contributions. We\r\nhave no means of knowing how far he was in earnest in this scheme. At\r\nall events, it came to nothing. In 1840, he was elected Judge of the\r\nCourt of General Sessions, which he held till the law constituting the\r\ncourt was changed. Mr. Noah was, however, more known as an editor than\r\nas a politician. Though without any very lofty aims, or high\r\nqualifications, he was an agreeable and sprightly paragraphist,\r\npossessed of an unfailing good-humor, and a large fund of general\r\ninformation. He was connected successively with a number of papers, and\r\nat the time of his death was editor of a Sunday paper, _The Messenger\r\nand Times_. He also published at different times a number of works of a\r\nmiscellaneous character, chiefly essays and plays, some of which met\r\nwith great success at the time of publication; but none of them\r\npossessed sufficient vitality to take a permanent place in the\r\nliterature of the country. His death was the consequence of a paralytic\r\nstroke. He lived and died a believer in the faith of his fathers, the\r\nHebrew religion; and was buried with the solemn ceremonies practiced by\r\nthe ancient chosen people. He was of a most generous and genial nature,\r\nand enjoyed the warmest good-will of all with whom he was brought into\r\npersonal relations.\r\n\r\nGEORGE M. BROOKE, Brevet Major-General in the United States army, died\r\nat San Antonio, Texas, on the 19th of March. He was a native of\r\nVirginia, and entered the army in 1808. He was brevetted\r\nLieutenant-Colonel in 1814, for \"gallant conduct in the defense of Fort\r\nErie.\" A month later he received the rank of Brevet Colonel, for\r\n\"distinguished and meritorious services in the sortie from Fort Erie.\"\r\nIn 1824, he was made Brevet Brigadier-General for \"ten years' faithful\r\nservice as Colonel.\" In 1848, he was brevetted as Major-General for\r\n\"meritorious conduct, particularly in the performance of his duties in\r\nthe prosecution of the war with Mexico.\"\r\n\r\nALEXANDER S. WADSWORTH, Commodore in the United States Navy, died at\r\nWashington, April 9, in the 61st year of his age. He was a native of\r\nMaine. He entered the service in 1804, and for many years served with\r\ndistinction. His commission of post-captain, bears date from 1825. His\r\nname stood the seventh on the naval list. Severe and protracted illness\r\nhad for many years disabled him from active duty.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL FARMAR JARVIS, D.D., died at Middletown, Conn., March 26th. He\r\nwas born in January, 1787. He had the reputation of being one of the\r\nripest scholars in the Episcopal Church, and was a member of the\r\nprincipal literary and historical societies in this country. His\r\nextensive acquirements, and fondness for accurate investigation procured\r\nfor him the appointment of \"Historigrapher of the Church,\" which was\r\nconferred upon him in 1838, with a view to his preparing a faithful\r\n\"Ecclesiastical History, reaching from the Apostles' time, to the\r\nformation of the Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States.\" The\r\nfirst volume, forming a Chronological Introduction, was published in\r\n1845. It is understood that a continuation of the work was nearly ready\r\nfor press at the time of his death.\r\n\r\nJOHN S. SKINNER, Editor of the \"_Plough, the Loom, and the Anvil_,\" and\r\nwell known for his agricultural writings, died at Baltimore, March 21,\r\naged about 70 years. He was universally esteemed for his social\r\nqualities, unassuming demeanor, and generous impulses. His death was\r\noccasioned by a fall into the basement in the Post Office at Baltimore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterary Notices\r\n\r\n\r\nTicknor, Reed, and Fields have issued _The House of the Seven Gables_, a\r\nRomance, by NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE, which is strongly marked with the bold\r\nand unique characteristics that have given its author such a brilliant\r\nposition among American novelists. The scene, which is laid in the old\r\nPuritanic town of Salem, extends from the period of the witchcraft\r\nexcitement to the present time, connecting the legends of the ancient\r\nsuperstition with the recent marvels of animal magnetism, and affording\r\nfull scope for the indulgence of the most weird and sombre fancies.\r\nDestitute of the high-wrought manifestations of passion which\r\ndistinguished the \"Scarlet Letter,\" it is more terrific in its\r\nconception, and not less intense in its execution, but exquisitely\r\nrelieved by charming portraitures of character, and quaint and comic\r\ndescriptions of social eccentricities. A deep vein of reflection\r\nunderlies the whole narrative, often rising naturally to the surface,\r\nand revealing the strength of the foundation on which the subtle, aerial\r\ninventions of the author are erected. His frequent dashes of humor\r\ngracefully blend with the monotone of the story, and soften the harsher\r\ncolors in which he delights to clothe his portentous conceptions. In no\r\nformer production of his pen, are his unrivalled powers of description\r\ndisplayed to better advantage. The rusty wooden house in\r\nPyncheon-street, with its seven sharp-pointed gables, and its huge\r\nclustered chimney--the old elm tree before the door--the grassy yard\r\nseen through the lattice-fence, with its enormous fertility of\r\nburdocks--and the green moss on the slopes of the roof, with the flowers\r\ngrowing aloft in the air in the nook between two of the gables--present\r\na picture to the eye as distinct as if our childhood had been passed in\r\nthe shadow of the old weather-beaten edifice. Nor are the characters of\r\nthe story drawn with less sharp and vigorous perspective. They stand out\r\nfrom the canvas as living realities. In spite of the supernatural\r\ndrapery in which they are enveloped, they have such a genuine expression\r\nof flesh and blood, that we can not doubt we have known them all our\r\ndays. They have the air of old acquaintance--only we wonder how the\r\nartist got them to sit for their likenesses. The grouping of these\r\npersons is managed with admirable artistic skill. Old Maid Pyncheon,\r\nconcealing under her verjuice scowl the unutterable tenderness of a\r\nsister--her woman-hearted brother, on whose sensitive nature had fallen\r\nsuch a strange blight--sweet and beautiful Phebe, the noble\r\nvillage-maiden, whose presence is always like that of some shining\r\nangel--the dreamy, romantic descendant of the legendary wizard--the\r\nbold, bad man of the world, reproduced at intervals in the bloody\r\nColonel, and the unscrupulous Judge--wise old Uncle Venner--and\r\ninappeasable Ned Higgins--are all made to occupy the place on the canvas\r\nwhich shows the lights and shades of their character in the most\r\nimpressive contrast, and contributes to the wonderful vividness and\r\nharmony of the grand historical picture. On the whole, we regard \"The\r\nHouse of the Seven Gables,\" though it exhibits no single scenes that may\r\nnot be matched in depth and pathos by some of Mr. Hawthorne's previous\r\ncreations, as unsurpassed by any thing he has yet written, in exquisite\r\nbeauty of finish, in the skillful blending of the tragic and comic, and\r\nin the singular life-like reality with which the wildest traditions of\r\nthe Puritanic age are combined with the every-day incidents of modern\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nHarper and Brothers have published a translation of _Buttmann's Greek\r\nGrammar_, by Professor EDWARD ROBINSON, from the eighteenth German\r\nedition, containing additions and improvements by ALEXANDER BUTTMANN,\r\nthe son of the original author. Since the publication of the thirteenth\r\nedition in 1829, which was the last that the author lived to complete,\r\ngradual changes have been introduced into the Grammar, especially in the\r\ndepartment of syntax, which has been expanded and re-written, with the\r\naid of the extensive investigations of the last twenty years. The\r\ntranslation bears the same impress of diligence, accuracy, and\r\nphilological tact, which is never looked for in vain in the productions\r\nof the indefatigable and distinguished author.\r\n\r\n_Ecclesiastical Manual_, by LUTHER LEE (published at the Wesleyan\r\nMethodist Book Room), is a brief treatise on the nature of Church\r\nGovernment, defending the right of visible church organization against\r\nprevailing latitudinarian and transcendental views on the one hand, and\r\nmaintaining liberal principles of polity against the high claims of\r\nEpiscopacy and the assumptions of the clergy on the other. The argument\r\nis conducted with candor and moderation, though not without spirit, and\r\nmay be studied to advantage by all who would understand the points at\r\nissue.\r\n\r\n_William Penn, An Historical Biography_, by WILLIAM HEPWORTH DIXON\r\n(published by Blanchard and Lea), is a new and complete life of the\r\nfounder of Pennsylvania, derived from contemporary papers that have been\r\nbrought to light within a recent period, and from original and\r\nunpublished documents. The view given by the author, of the religious\r\nsystem of Fox and Penn, as coinciding with the principles of republican\r\nfreedom, is a reproduction of the admirable exhibition of Quakerism\r\npresented by Bancroft in his History of the United States. In the\r\nAppendix, the charges against William Penn by Macaulay are submitted to\r\na rigid examination; the evidence on the subject is skillfully and\r\nthoroughly sifted; and the strongest case made out for the accused\r\nagainst the insinuations of the ingenious and eloquent historian. With\r\nhis warm sympathies in favor of the subject of his narrative, and the\r\nfamiliar knowledge of his career gained by the researches of several\r\nyears, Mr. Dixon has produced a genial and instructive piece of\r\nbiography, sustaining the claims of the illustrious Quaker to the noble\r\nand elevated rank in which he has been placed by the general voice of\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\n_Physico-Physiological Researches on the Dynamics of Magnetism, &c._, by\r\nBaron CHARLES VON REICHENBACH, translated from the German, by JOHN\r\nASHBURNER, M.D., is a scientific treatise, showing the relations of\r\nmagnetism, electricity, heat, light, crystallization, and chemism to the\r\nvital forces of the human body. It is founded on an extensive series of\r\nexperiments, which tend to bring the mysterious phenomena of Mesmerism\r\nwithin the domain of physics, and in fact to reduce the whole subject\r\nof physiology to a department of chemical science. The papers, of which\r\nit is composed, were originally intended as contributions to the \"Annals\r\nof Chemistry,\" conducted by the celebrated Professor Liebig, in which\r\nperiodical they appeared in the year 1845. In the present collected\r\nform, they have received some necessary corrections, but their spirit\r\nand substance are presented without alteration. The investigations, of\r\nwhich the results are here described, are of a singularly curious\r\ncharacter, exhibiting the most astonishing developments, with a\r\nphilosophical calmness that is rare even among German savants.\r\n\r\n_The Rangers; or, The Tory's Daughter_, is the title of a novel\r\nillustrative of the revolutionary history of Vermont, by the author of\r\n\"The Green Mountain Boys,\" published by B. B. Mussy and Co., Boston. It\r\ngives many agreeable descriptions of Vermont scenery, with sketches of\r\nits social life during the war of the Revolution, and shows considerable\r\nskill in combining the prominent historical facts of that day with the\r\nfictitious incidents of a lively and exciting plot.\r\n\r\n_The Ballads and Songs_ of WILLIAM PEMBROKE MULCHINOCH (published by T.\r\nW. Strong), is a collection of fugitive poetry, inspired with the\r\ngenuine breathings of Irish patriotism, frequently displaying great\r\nfacility and sweetness of versification, and pervaded throughout with a\r\nwinning sentiment of tenderness and human sympathy.\r\n\r\nHarper and Brothers have published a neat volume, entitled _Nature and\r\nBlessedness of Christian Purity,_ by Rev. R. S. FOSTER, with an\r\nIntroduction by EDMUND S. JANES, D.D., one of the Bishops of the\r\nMethodist Episcopal Church. Without aiming at any rivalry with other\r\nwriters on the subject, the author devotes his work to the maintenance\r\nof the views which are set forth by the standard Wesleyan authorities.\r\nAvoiding all considerations of a purely speculative character, he\r\npresents the practical aspects of his theme, with discrimination,\r\nearnestness, and force. His style, which is always animated and\r\neffective, betrays the influence of profound and accurate thought, and\r\nis equally adapted to make a favorable impression on the understanding\r\nand on the heart of the attentive reader. The well-written Preface by\r\nBishop Janes, gives a lucid summary of the contents of the volume, with\r\na warm commendation of the manner in which it is executed.\r\n\r\n_Lyra Catholica_ (published by E. Dunigan and Brother), is a collection\r\nof the Hymns of the Roman Breviary and Missal, with others adapted for\r\nevery day in the week, and the Festivals and Saints' Days throughout the\r\nyear. The translation of the Breviary, by Mr. Caswell, is adopted\r\nwithout change, and forms the first part of the present work, while the\r\nsecond part consists of hymns and anthems from various sources,\r\nespecially from the contributions of Rev. F. W. Faber, Matthew Brydges,\r\nEsq., and Rev. William Young. The third part is devoted to sacred poetry\r\nof a less strictly devotional cast. In addition to a few pieces from\r\nmodern poets, it contains a selection from the compositions of Catholic\r\nwriters belonging to an earlier age of English literature, including\r\n\"the simple and earnest strains of Southwell, a poet, priest, and\r\nmartyr, whose unshaken soul passed away in song from the fires of\r\npersecution; Crashaw, whose tender fancy and graceful zeal have extorted\r\nthe highest praises of unfriendly judges; the manly virtue of Habington,\r\npure in an age of license; the later compositions of Dryden, the\r\natonements laid by his repentant muse on the altar of religion.\"\r\n\r\n_The Soldier of the Cross_, by the Rev. JOHN LEYBURN, D.D. (published by\r\nCarter and Brothers), is a popular and attractive exposition of\r\nEphesians vi. 10-18, consisting of a series of discourses delivered from\r\nthe pulpit, but recast into the form of plain and practical essays,\r\nwritten with considerable force. The talents of the author and the taste\r\nof the publishers have made an addition to our religious literature, of\r\nwhich the public estimation is indicated by the early call for a second\r\nedition.\r\n\r\n_The Irish Confederates, and the Rebellion of 1798_, by HENRY M. FIELD\r\n(published by Harper and Brothers), is a lively historical sketch of the\r\nmovements of the Irish patriots in behalf of the freedom of their nation\r\ntoward the close of the last century. The volume opens with a rapid\r\nsurvey of Irish history, traces the love of liberty among the people,\r\ndescribes the causes of their national characteristics, and minutely\r\nportrays the events of the fruitless struggle, which terminated in the\r\ncomplete subjection of their beautiful island to the British crown.\r\nAmong the biographical sketches, those of Curran, Tone, Lord Edward\r\nFitzgerald, the Emmets, McNevin, and Sampson of course occupy a\r\nprominent place, and are drawn with an affectionate sympathy, which\r\ndelights to linger around every memorial of their noble and chivalrous\r\ncharacters. Mr. Field has enjoyed peculiar facilities for the\r\ncomposition of this volume. A visit to Ireland some four years since\r\nawakened a strong interest in the fortunes of her people. At a\r\nsubsequent period, he formed an intimate acquaintance with several of\r\nthe families of the Irish exiles in New York, and from the narratives\r\nthus obtained, was furnished with some of the most valuable materials\r\nfor his story. Nor has he neglected the study of the different\r\nhistorians of the time. His work, accordingly, combines the vivacity of\r\na personal narrative, with the accuracy of thorough research. It is\r\ndeeply imbued with a love of Ireland, with a sense of indignation at the\r\noutrages which she has endured, and with admiration of the valor and\r\ndevotion of her gallant sons; though in no case, do the evident\r\npartialities of the writer appear to have interfered with his strict\r\nhistorical fidelity, or to have tempted him to an uncritical use of the\r\nfacts at his command. His style is simple and unaffected, warmed with a\r\npersuasive earnestness, and animated with a chaste enthusiasm, but owing\r\nnone of its interest to the allurements of rhetoric. Indeed, a more\r\nelaborate construction would often have been in better keeping with the\r\ndignity of the subject, while the almost exclusive use of short\r\nsentences at length overcomes the reader with a painful feeling of\r\nmonotony. There are also occasional instances of careless and\r\nunauthorized expression, which, in a writer of such real ability and\r\ncultivation as Mr. Field, excite the surprise of the fastidious reader.\r\n\r\nHarper and Brothers have issued an edition of the _History of Greece_,\r\nby Dr. LEONHARD SCHMITZ, which forms an appropriate companion to the\r\n_History of Rome_, published by the accomplished author four years\r\nsince. The purpose of Dr. Schmitz in each of these Histories is to give,\r\nin a popular form, the result of the researches by modern scholars which\r\nhave placed the subject in a new light. In the composition of this\r\nvolume, the author has availed himself of the erudite labors of Bishop\r\nThirlwall, abridging his great work in some portions, and interweaving\r\nhis masterly views into the texture of his narrative, where a free style\r\nwas more suitable to the subject. As a manual for young students in\r\nGrecian history, and a work for general and family reading, this volume\r\nis not surpassed by any production of the present day. The experience of\r\nthe author as a practical educator, his admirable classical attainments,\r\nand the caution and soundness of his historical judgments, give him\r\npeculiar qualifications for the task he has undertaken. His style is\r\nsimple and condensed; his illustrations are singularly apposite; and his\r\ngrouping of topics is picturesque and forcible. For popular use, we have\r\nno doubt, that both the Grecian and Roman Histories of Dr. Schmitz will\r\nspeedily take the precedence of all others in this country, as they have\r\ndone, to a very considerable degree, in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThe popular series of _Franconia Stories_, by JACOB ABBOTT (published by\r\nHarper and Brothers), is completed by the publication of _Mary Bell_ and\r\n_Beechnut_. The excellent author has placed the whole juvenile community\r\nunder new obligations by the issue of these delightful stories. He is so\r\nperfectly at home in every phase of country life, and so ingenious in\r\nworking up its daily occurrences into a charming narrative, that he can\r\nnever fail of a listening audience. Few American authors have the power\r\nof so impressing themselves on the memory and the heart of their\r\nreaders. The present series will doubtless add to his beautiful\r\ninfluence and to his fame.\r\n\r\nThe Third Number of _London Labor and The London Poor_, by HENRY MAYHEW,\r\nis issued by Harper and Brothers, and will be found to increase the\r\ninterest with which that remarkable series has been received by the\r\npublic. His pictures of the condition of the laboring classes in London\r\nhave a minuteness and vividness of detail which would not disgrace a\r\nDutch painting.\r\n\r\n_The Roman Republic of_ 1849, by THEODORE DWIGHT (published by R. Van\r\nDien), is a brief historical view of the recent revolutionary movements\r\nin Italy, with biographical sketches of Mazzini, Garibaldi, Avezzana,\r\nFilopanti, Foresti, and other leading Italian Republicans.\r\n\r\nTicknor, Reed, and Fields have issued the fourth volume of their\r\nbeautiful edition of the _Collective Writings_ of THOMAS DE QUINCY,\r\ncontaining _The Cæsars_, a work characterized by the subtilty of\r\nreflection, curious learning, and original felicities of expression, for\r\nwhich the author is pre-eminent.\r\n\r\n_Life on the Plains of the Pacific_, by Rev. GUSTAVUS HINE (published by\r\nGeo. H. Derby and Co., Buffalo), is the title of a work devoted to the\r\nhistory, condition, and prospects of Oregon, with a description of its\r\ngeography, climate, and productions, and of personal adventures among\r\nthe Indians. It contains a detailed history of the Oregon Mission, drawn\r\nfrom the most authentic sources, including the notes and journals of the\r\nfirst missionaries on that station. The journal of the author,\r\ncommencing with the departure of the missionaries from New York in 1839,\r\npresents an interesting narrative of the largest expedition of this kind\r\nthat ever sailed from an American port, and is enriched with a great\r\nvariety of facts and incidents that occurred in the wide field of\r\nobservation that forms the subject of the volume. Without pretending to\r\nthe graces of literary composition, the writer has produced a work of\r\nsterling value. His authority will no doubt be appealed to with\r\nconfidence on all matters pertaining to the important scene of his\r\nlabors.\r\n\r\n_Hints to Sportsmen_, by E. J. LEWIS (published by Blanchard and Lea,\r\nPhiladelphia), is a regular-built treatise on all the mysteries of the\r\nsporting craft. The author writes like an experienced shot. His book is\r\nnot only a valuable manual for the sportsman, but a tempting volume for\r\nthe lovers of spirited description.\r\n\r\n_Curran and his Contemporaries_, by CHARLES PHILLIPS (published by\r\nHarper and Brothers), is a reproduction of the celebrated work of\r\nCounselor Phillips, having been subjected by the author to a thorough\r\nrevision and amendment. It describes the interesting period of Irish\r\nhistory during which Curran was the leading member of the Bar, with\r\ngreat vivacity and force. Touching lightly on the politics of the times,\r\nit presents a series of personal delineations, which are drawn to the\r\nlife by the enthusiastic and genial author. The freshness of his\r\nrecollections affords an abundance of piquant anecdote, which, with his\r\nwarm sympathies with the Irish character, gives a perpetual liveliness\r\nand glow to the narrative, redeeming it from every approach to dullness,\r\nand sustaining the interest of the reader to the close of the volume.\r\n\r\n_Louisiana: Its Colonial History and Romance,_ by CHARLES GAYARRE\r\n(published by Harper and Brothers), is a republication of the lectures\r\nof the author on \"The Poetry, or the Romance of the History of\r\nLouisiana,\" with the addition of seven new lectures, bringing the\r\nsubject down to the departure of Bienville, the founder of the colony,\r\nin 1743. Among the interesting topics discussed in the second series of\r\nlectures, are the formation of the Mississippi Company, the History of\r\nLaw's financial career, the foundation of New Orleans, the Manners and\r\nCustoms of the Natchez tribe, the wars between the Indians and the\r\nColonists, and others, which bring the romantic incidents connected with\r\nthe colonization of Louisiana into prominent view. The period was\r\nfertile in singular adventures, presenting abundant materials for the\r\npoet or novelist. Mr. Gayarre has made a felicitous selection of topics,\r\nwhich, under the brilliant coloring of a lively imagination, are\r\npresented in a picturesque and attractive form. The substance of his\r\nwork is founded on the conclusions of exact historical research, while\r\nthe drapery in which its scenes and characters are arrayed form a\r\ngraceful accompaniment to the severity of truth. With a perpetual\r\nvivacity of style, and a profusion of glowing imagery, Mr. Gayarre never\r\nbecomes tedious or insipid. His volume is always delightful as a poem,\r\nif it is not complete as a record, and will hold a high place among the\r\npopular contributions to the \"Romance of History.\"\r\n\r\nE. C. and J. Biddle have published _An Elementary Treatise on Statics_,\r\nby GASPARD MONGE, translated by WOODS BAKER, a work which has obtained a\r\ndistinguished reputation in the scientific literature of France, by its\r\nclear and correct style, its rigorous demonstrations, and its\r\nwell-connected propositions. It is adapted to fill a place, for which no\r\nadequate provision has been made by the usual treatises on the subject\r\nin the English language. Most of these are voluminous, and suited only\r\nto the more advanced classes of students, or else composed chiefly of\r\npractical and descriptive details. The present volume treats the subject\r\nin the synthetic method, and can be understood without difficulty by\r\nthose who are familiar with Euclid's Elements.\r\n\r\n_Warreniana._--Ticknor, Reed, and Fields have issued a reprint of this\r\ncelebrated _jeu d'esprit,_ which still retains its popularity, together\r\nwith the _Rejected Addresses,_ to which it forms an appropriate\r\ncompanion. The peculiarities of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Southey,\r\nChristopher North, Washington Irving, Scott, Moore, Brougham,\r\nWilberforce, and other names of sufficient eminence to provoke a quiz,\r\nare hit off with capital success. The most astringent features are\r\nalways relaxed in the perusal of these amusing pages.\r\n\r\nJ. S. Redfield has issued an edition of JUNG STILLING'S _Theory of\r\nPneumatology_, and of CAHAGNET'S _Celestial Telegraph_, which are filled\r\nwith the latest information on the whole subject of ghosts,\r\npresentiments, visions, and the world of spirits, obtained professedly\r\nfrom the most authentic sources. Stilling's work is introduced with a\r\nPreface by Rev. Dr. BUSH, highly commending its purposes and character.\r\nThe \"Celestial Telegraph\" beats Jackson Davis and the Rochester\r\nKnockings all hollow. Whoever is curious in the literature of the\r\nsupernatural will find enough here to satisfy the most craving love of\r\nthe marvelous.\r\n\r\nTicknor, Reed, and Fields have published a volume of _Poems_, by HENRY\r\nT. TUCKERMAN, distinguished for the sweet and graceful fancies, the\r\nfluent aptness of expression, the joyous sympathy with nature, and the\r\nrefined delicacy of taste by which most of the writings of the author\r\nare characterized. The vein of tranquil reflection which pervades them,\r\nand the chastened utterance of feeling which vails rather than embodies\r\nstrong emotion, though not among the elements of popular poetry, will\r\nrecommend them to the congenial reader.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Moore, Philadelphia, has published a useful little volume for\r\nstudents in design, entitled _The Theory of Effect_, by An Artist. It is\r\nintended not only for the use of beginners, but of those who have\r\nattained a proficiency in the art, while they are unacquainted with the\r\nprinciples on which the correctness of their pictures depends. The rules\r\nof Effect are laid down with great precision and minuteness, and\r\nillustrated with several neat engravings by Hinckley.\r\n\r\n_The Volcano Diggings_ is the title of a lively story, by a Member of\r\nthe Bar, illustrating the administration of the law in California.\r\nSeveral scenes, which are evidently taken from the life, are described\r\nwith a good deal of spirit, and throw a strong, but not altogether\r\nflattering light on the condition of society at the placers. (Published\r\nby J. S. Redfield).\r\n\r\nGeorge P. Putnam has issued _The Wing-and-Wing_, forming another volume\r\nof the Collected Works of J. FENIMORE COOPER. In the Preface to this\r\nedition, the author remarks, that \"he acknowledges a strong paternal\r\nfeeling in behalf of this book, placing it very high in the estimate of\r\nits merits, as compared with other books from the same pen; a species of\r\ncommendation that need wound no man.\"\r\n\r\nThe same publisher has issued a new and revised edition of _The Conquest\r\nof Florida_, by THEODORE IRVING. The author expresses his gratification\r\nin finding his account of De Soto's expedition confirmed by the most\r\nrecent investigations. His work is justly entitled to the reputation\r\nwhich it has obtained, as a classic authority, on an interesting period\r\nof American history.\r\n\r\nPhillips, Sampson, and Co. have published a valuable collection of\r\nfinancial essays, entitled _The Banker's Commonplace Book_, containing\r\nMr. A. B. Johnson's pithy treatise on the Principles of Banking and the\r\nDuties of a Banker, Gilbart's Ten Minutes' Advice on Keeping a Bank,\r\nwith several articles on Bills of Exchange, and a summary of the Banking\r\nLaws of Massachusetts. It will prove a useful manual on the subject to\r\nwhich it is devoted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTWO LEAVES FROM PUNCH.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENCOURAGEMENT TO BOOK-LENDERS.\r\n\r\n\"IF YOU PLEASE, SIR, MASTER'S SENT BACK THE FIRST VOLUME, AND HE SAYS\r\nWILL YOU BE SO GOOD AS TO LET HIM 'AVE THE SECOND?\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPLOMACY AND GASTRONOMY.\r\n\r\nIt is a very generally received opinion that _gammon_ is the basis of\r\ndiplomacy; but the fact is, that it is impossible to conduct\r\ninternational negotiations on the foundation of that humble and\r\neconomical fare, even when rendered more palatable by the addition of\r\nspinach. MR. RIVES, it is said, has written a letter to MR. WEBSTER,\r\ncomplaining that the American Embassadorship can not be done at Paris\r\nunder £9000 a year, and adds that\r\n\r\n     \"_According to_ MR. PAKENHAM, _good dinners are half the battle\r\n     of diplomacy, and the most favorable treaties are gained by\r\n     liberal feeding._\"\r\n\r\nThis aphorism suggests important reflections.\r\n\r\nA main point to be attended to in the formation of a diplomatic corps is\r\nthe commissariat; and the force must be well armed with knives and\r\nforks, in addition to being supplied with plate armor.\r\n\r\nThe trenches in diplomatic warfare must be manned by regular\r\ntrenchermen.\r\n\r\nRivals in diplomacy must be cut out by actual carving; and in order to\r\ndish them, recourse must be had to real dishes.\r\n\r\nIf one diplomatist wishes to turn the tables on another, it is requisite\r\nthat he and his suite should keep the better tables.\r\n\r\nThe politeness of diplomatic intercourse should be qualified, in some\r\nmeasure, with sauce, and its gravity tempered with gravy.\r\n\r\nTreating, in diplomacy, is best managed by giving \"a spread.\"\r\n\r\nBold diplomatists are those \"who greatly daring, dine.\"\r\n\r\nThe most liberal foreign policy is that of giving grand banquets.\r\n\r\nA plenipotentiary should have unlimited powers of cramming.\r\n\r\nAn embassador has been defined to be, \"a man sent abroad to lie for the\r\nsake of the commonwealth;\" but the definition must be enlarged to\r\nexpress the fact, that he is also a person deputed to a foreign country\r\nto eat and drink for the interest of his native land.\r\n\r\nThe most important diplomatic functions are those of digestion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUPPER AT A JUVENILE PARTY.\r\n\r\n_Alfred._ \"I SAY, FRANK, ARN'T YOU GOING TO HAVE SOME SUPPER?\"\r\n\r\n_Frank._ \"A--NOT AT PRESENT.

But the spoken\r\nand written language of London are so different that it is feared these\r\nbooks will be of little use. Mr. PUNCH furnishes the following\r\ncorrections of the two most important chapters, by the diligent study of\r\nwhich it is hoped that visitors may be enabled to ride and dine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CONVERSE WITH A CABMAN.\r\n\r\n_What the Book said._                         _What the Man said._\r\n\r\nDo you wish, Sir, to ride in                  C'b?

YOU SEE, MUM,\r\nYOURS IS SUCH A REMARKABLE LONG AND NARRER FOOT!\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFASHIONS FOR MAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. I.--PROMENADE COSTUMES.]\r\n\r\nThis is the season when Fashion is more perplexed than at any other, in\r\nher endeavors to give humanity a _seasonable_ garb. Boreas and Zephyrus\r\noften bear rule on the same day, one reigning with mildness in the\r\nmorning, the other despotically at evening. Those votaries of Fashion\r\nare the wiser, who pay court to the former; for, generally, it is almost\r\nJune, in our Northern States, before we may be certain that the chilling\r\nbreath of early Spring will be no more felt.\r\n\r\nThis being the season for rides and promenades, our illustrations for\r\nthis month are devoted chiefly to the representation of appropriate\r\ncostume for those healthful exercises in the open air. The large figure\r\nin our first plate, represents an elegant style of promenade dress.\r\n_Pardessus_ are much worn at this season, made in a lighter manner than\r\nthose used earlier. Velvet _pardessus_ with silk or satin linings, but\r\nnot padded, are used. Our illustration represents one of black velvet,\r\ntrimmed with several narrow rows of satin of the same color. The dress\r\nis amber-colored figured silk, with a very full plain skirt. _Capotes_\r\nor bonnets of satin are also worn. An elegant style is made of violet\r\nvelvet and satin, ornamented with heart's-ease almost hidden within\r\n_coques_ of satin and velvet, which are arranged in a tasteful manner\r\nupon the exterior of the _capote_, the interior being decorated with\r\nheart's-ease to match, which may or may not be intermixed with lace or\r\n_tulle_, according to the taste of the wearer.\r\n\r\nCostumes for young misses are also represented in our first\r\nillustration. The larger one has a dress of a pale chocolate cachmere,\r\ntrimmed with narrow silk fringe; the double robings on each side of the\r\nfront as well as the cape, on the half-high corsage, ornamented with a\r\ndouble row of narrow silk fringe. This trimming is also repeated round\r\nthe lower part of the loose sleeve. Chemisette of plaited cambric,\r\nheaded with a broad frill of embroidery; full under-sleeves of cambric,\r\nwith a row of embroidery round the wrist. Open bonnet of pink satin, a\r\nrow of white lace encircling the interior next the face. Boots of pale\r\nviolet cachmere and morocco. Trowsers of worked cambric. The smaller\r\nfigure has a frock of plaided cachmere. _Paletot_ of purple velvet, or\r\ndark cachmere; a round hat of white satin, the low crown adorned with a\r\nlong white ostrich feather. Trowsers and under-sleeves of white\r\nembroidered cambric. Button gaiter boots of chocolate cachmere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--EVENING COSTUME.]\r\n\r\nFigure 2 represents a most elegant costume for an evening party, or a\r\nball. It is composed of a beautifully embroidered white satin dress, the\r\nskirt looped up on the right side, and decorated with a bunch of the\r\npink honey-plant, heading three pink and white _marabout_ tips, from\r\nwhich depend three ends of deep silk fringe, pink and white. Low\r\npointed corsage, the top of which is encircled with a small embroidered\r\npointed cape, edged as well as the short sleeves with a deep pink and\r\nwhite fringe, and confined upon the centre with a cluster of feathers\r\nand flowers, decorated in the centre with a butterfly composed of\r\nprecious stones. The hair is simply arranged with a narrow wreath of\r\npink and white velvet leaves, finished on the right side with two small\r\n_marabout_ feathers, and two ends of fringe drooping low.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--MORNING PROMENADE COSTUME.]\r\n\r\nFigure 3 is a morning promenade costume. A high dress of black satin,\r\nthe body fitting perfectly tight; a small jacket cut on the bias, with\r\ntwo rows of black velvet laid on a little distance from the edge. The\r\nsleeves are rather large, and have abroad cuff turned back, which is\r\ntrimmed to correspond with the jacket. The skirt is long and full; the\r\ndress ornamented up the front in its whole length by rich fancy silk\r\ntrimmings, graduating in size from the bottom of the skirt to the waist,\r\nand again increasing to the throat. Bonnet of plum-colored satin; a\r\nbunch of heart's-ease, intermixed with ribbon, placed low on the left\r\nside; the same flowers, but somewhat smaller, ornament the interior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4 AND 5.--HEAD-DRESSES.]\r\n\r\nFigures 4 and 5 represent different styles of head-dresses for balls or\r\nevening parties. Figure 4 is a combination of flowers and splendid\r\nribbons, with a fall on each side, of the richest lace. Figure 5 is very\r\nbrilliant. It is a wreath of Ceres form, composed of small flowers in\r\nrubies, emeralds, and diamonds, perfectly resembling natural flowers,\r\nwith ears of wheat freely intermingled. At this season the head-dresses\r\nare chiefly of the floral description. Feathers and flowers intermixed,\r\nform a very beautiful _coiffure_.",
