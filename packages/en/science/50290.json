Lieutenant Corriston had come to see its marvels, but he soon\r\nfound himself entrapped in its unsuspected terrors.\r\n\r\nFor the grim reality was that some deadly outer-space power had usurped\r\ncontrol of the great artificial moon. A lovely woman had disappeared;\r\npassengers were being fleeced and enslaved; and, using fantastic\r\ndisguises, imposters were using the Station for their own mysterious\r\nends.\r\n\r\nPursued by unearthly monsters and hunted with super-scientific cunning,\r\nCorriston struggles to unmask the mystery. For upon his success\r\ndepended his life, his love and the future of Earth itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAST OF CHARACTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRISTON\r\n\r\nHe saw all the sights of the Space Station ... in fact, he saw too\r\nmuch....\r\n\r\n\r\nHAYES\r\n\r\nHis decision would mean the beginning or the end for a world.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLAKEY\r\n\r\nThis bodyguard needed special protection himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEMENT\r\n\r\nSometimes it seemed as if he were leading a double life.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENLEY\r\n\r\nWith him for a friend one didn't need an enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nHELEN RAMSEY\r\n\r\nHer father had made her a virtual prisoner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a life-and-death struggle--cruel, remorseless, one-sided.\r\nCorriston was breathing heavily. He was in total darkness, dodging the\r\nblows of a killer. His adversary was as lithe as a cat, muscular and\r\ndangerous. He had a knife and he was using it, slashing at Corriston\r\nwhen Corriston came close, then leaping back and lashing out with a\r\nhard-knuckled fist.\r\n\r\nCorriston could hear the swish of the man's heels as he pivoted, could\r\njudge almost with split-second timing when the next blow would come.\r\nHe was bleeding from a cut on his right shoulder, and there was a\r\ntumultuous throbbing at his temples, an ache in his groin.\r\n\r\nThe fact that he had no weapon put him at a terrifying disadvantage. He\r\nhad been close to death before, but never in so confined a space or in\r\nsuch close proximity to a man who had certainly killed once and would\r\nnot hesitate to kill again.\r\n\r\nHis determination to survive was pitted against what appeared to be\r\nsheer brute strength fortified by cunning and a far-above-average\r\nagility. He began slowly to retreat, backing away until a massive steel\r\ngirder stopped him. He was battling dizziness now and his heart had\r\nbegun a furious pounding.\r\n\r\nHe found himself slipping sideways along the girder, running his hands\r\nover its smooth, cold surface. To his sweating palms the surface seemed\r\nas chill as the lid of a coffin, but he refused to believe that it\r\ncould trap him irretrievably. The girder had to end somewhere.\r\n\r\nThe killer was coming close again, his shoes making a scraping sound\r\nin the darkness, his breathing just barely audible. Corriston edged\r\nstill further along the girder. Inch by inch he moved parallel to it,\r\nfighting off his dizziness, making a desperate effort to keep from\r\nfalling. The wetness on his shoulder was unnerving, the absence of\r\npain incredible. How seriously could a man be stabbed without feeling\r\nany pain at all? He didn't know. But at least his shoulder wasn't\r\nparalyzed. He could move his arm freely, flex the muscles of his back.\r\n\r\nHow unbelievably cruel it was that a ship could move through space with\r\nthe stability of a completely stationary object. How unbelievably cruel\r\nat this moment, when the slightest lurch might have saved him.\r\n\r\nThe girder was stationary and immense, and in his tormented inward\r\nvision he saw it as a strand in a gigantic steel cobweb, symbolizing\r\nthe grandeur of what man could accomplish by routine compulsion alone.\r\n\r\nIn frozen helplessness Corriston tried to bring his thoughts into\r\ncloser accord with reality, to view his peril in a saner light. But\r\nwhat was happening to him was as hard to relate to immediate reality\r\nas a line half remembered from a play. _See how the blood of Caesar\r\nfollowed it, as if rushing out of doors to be resolved if Brutus so\r\nunkindly knocked or no...._\r\n\r\nBut the killer wasn't Brutus. He was unknown and invisible and if\r\nthere had been any Brutuslike nobility in him, it hardly seemed likely\r\nthat he would have chosen for his first victim a wealthy girl's too\r\ntalkative bodyguard and for his second Corriston himself.\r\n\r\nThe killer was within arm's reach again when the barrier that had\r\ntrapped Corriston fell away abruptly. He reeled back, swayed dizzily,\r\nand experienced such wild elation that he cried out in unreasoning\r\ntriumph. Swiftly he retreated backwards, not fully realizing that no\r\nreal respite had been granted him. He was free only to recoil a few\r\nsteps, to crouch and weave about. Almost instantly the killer was\r\nclosing in again, and this time there was no escape.\r\n\r\nAnother metal girder stopped Corriston in midretreat, cutting across\r\nhis shoulders like a sharp-angled priming rod, jolting and sobering him.\r\n\r\nFor an eternity now he could do nothing but wait. An eternity as\r\nbrief as a dropped heartbeat and as long as the cycle of renewal and\r\nrebirth of worlds in the flaming vastness of space. Everything became\r\nimpersonal suddenly: the darkness of the ships' between-deck storage\r\ncompartment; the Space Station toward which the ship was traveling; the\r\nMartian deserts he had dreamed about as a boy.\r\n\r\nThe killer spoke then, for the first time. His voice rang out in the\r\ndarkness, harsh with contempt and rage. It was in some respects a\r\nsurprising voice, the voice of an educated man. But it was also a voice\r\nthat had in it an accent that Corriston had heard before in verbal\r\ndocumentaries and hundreds of newsreels; in clinical case histories,\r\nmicrofilm recorded, in penal institutions, on governing bodies,\r\nand wherever men were in a position to destroy others--or perhaps\r\nthemselves. It was the voice of an unloved, unwanted man.\r\n\r\nThe voice said: \"You're done for, my friend. I don't know what the\r\nRamsey girl told you, but you came looking for me, and it's too late\r\nnow for any kind of compromise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't looking for a deal,\" Corriston said. \"If it's any\r\nsatisfaction to you, Miss Ramsey told me nothing. But I saw a man\r\nkilled; and I couldn't find her afterwards. I think you know what\r\nhappened to her. Knife me, if you can. I'll go down fighting.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's easy to say. Maybe you _didn't_ come looking for me. But you\r\nknow too much now to go on living. Unless you--wait a minute! You\r\nmentioned a deal. If you're lying about the Ramsey girl and will tell\r\nme where she is, I might not kill you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wasn't lying,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\n\"Hell ... you're really asking for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I am.\"\r\n\r\n\"It won't be a pleasant way to die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any way is unpleasant. But I'm not dead yet. Killing me may not be as\r\neasy as you think.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be easy enough. This time you won't get past me.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston knew that the conversation was about to end unless something\r\nunexpected happened. And he didn't think there was much chance of that.\r\nHad he been clasping a metal tool, he would have swung hard enough to\r\nkill with it. But he wasn't clasping anything. He was crouching low,\r\nand suddenly he leapt straight forward into the darkness.\r\n\r\nHis head collided with a bony knee and his hands went swiftly out and\r\naround invisible ankles. He tightened his grip, half expecting the\r\nknife to descend and bury itself in his back. But it didn't. The other\r\nhad been taken so completely by surprise that he simply went backwards,\r\nsuddenly, and with a strangled oath.\r\n\r\nInstantly Corriston was on top of him. He shifted his grip, releasing\r\nboth of the struggling man's ankles and remorselessly seizing his\r\nwrists. He raised his right knee and brought it savagely downward,\r\nagain and again and again. A cry of pain echoed through the darkness.\r\nThe killer, crying out in torment, tried to twist free.\r\n\r\nFor an instant the outcome remained uncertain, a see-saw contest of\r\nstrength. Then Corriston had the knife and the struggle was over.\r\n\r\nCorriston made a mistake then of relaxing a little. Instantly, the\r\nkiller rolled sideways, broke Corriston's grip, and was on his feet.\r\nHe did not attempt to retaliate in any way. He simply disappeared into\r\nthe darkness, breathing so loudly that Corriston could tell when the\r\ndistance between them had dwindled to the vanishing point.\r\n\r\nCorriston sat very still in the darkness, holding on tightly to the\r\nknife. His triumph had been unexpected and complete. It had been close\r\nto miraculous. Strange that he should be aware of that and yet feel\r\nonly a dark horror growing in his mind. Strange that he should remember\r\nso quickly again the horror of a man gasping out his life with a\r\nthorned barb protruding from his side.\r\n\r\nIt had begun a half-hour earlier in the general passenger cabin. It had\r\nbegun with a wonder and a rejoicing.\r\n\r\nTremendous and glittering, the Space Station had come floating up out\r\nof the Big Dark like a golden bubble on an onrushing tidal wave. It\r\nhad hovered for an instant in the precise center of the viewscreen,\r\nits steep, climbing trail shedding radiance in all directions. Then it\r\nhad descended vertically until it almost filled the lower half of the\r\nscreen, and finally was lost to view in a wilderness of space.\r\n\r\nWhen it appeared for the second time, it was larger still and its\r\nshadow was a swiftly widening crescent blotting out the nearer stars.\r\n\r\n\"There it is!\" someone whispered.\r\n\r\nIt had been unreasonably quiet in the general passenger cabin, and for\r\na moment no other sound was audible. Then the whisper was caught up and\r\namplified by a dozen awestruck voices. It became a murmur of amazement\r\nand of wonder, and as it increased in volume, the screen seemed to glow\r\nwith an almost unbelievable brightness.\r\n\r\nEveryone was aware of the brightness. But how much of it was subjective\r\nno one knew or cared. To a man in the larger darkness of space, a dead\r\nsea bottom on Mars, or a moon-landing ship wrapped in eternal darkness\r\non a lonely peak in the Lunar Apennines may glow with a noonday\r\nsplendor.\r\n\r\n\"They said a space station that size could never be built,\" David\r\nCorriston said, leaning abruptly forward in his chair. \"They quoted\r\nreams of statistics: height above the center of the Earth in\r\nkilometers, orbital velocity, relation of mass to maneuverability. The\r\nexperts had a field day. They went far out on a limb to convince anyone\r\nwho would listen that a station weighing thousands of tons would never\r\nget past the blueprint stage. But the men who built it had enough\r\npride and confidence in human skill to achieve the impossible.\"\r\n\r\nThe girl at Corriston's side looked startled for an instant, as though\r\nthe ironclad assurance of so young a man was as much of a surprise as\r\nhis unexpected nearness, and somehow even more disquieting older.\r\n\r\nShe was certainly somewhat older than he was--about three or four\r\nyears. She was an exceptionally pretty girl, her fair hair fluffed out\r\nfrom under a blue beret, her ship's lounge jacket a youth-accentuating\r\nmiracle of casual tailoring that would have looked well on a woman of\r\nany age. She had the kind of eyes Corriston liked best of all in a\r\nwoman: longlashed, observant, and bright with glints of humor.\r\n\r\nShe had the kind of mouth he liked too--a mouth which suggested that\r\nshe could be, by turns, capricious, level-headed, and audaciously\r\nfriendly with strangers without in any way inviting familiarity.\r\nThere was a certain paradoxical timidity in her gaze too. It was\r\nmanifesting itself now in an obvious reluctance to be startled too\r\nabruptly by space engineering talk from a young man who had taken\r\nher companionability for granted and who was obviously given to snap\r\njudgments.\r\n\r\nShe brushed back the hair on her right temple, her brown eyes upraised\r\nto study Corriston more closely.\r\n\r\nHe hoped that she would realize upon reflection that she was behaving\r\nfoolishly. He had taken a certain liberty in talking to her as he would\r\nhave talked to an old acquaintance in a long-awaited meeting of minds.\r\nOn the big screen a space station that couldn't be built was sweeping\r\nin toward the ship with eighty-five years of unparallelled scientific\r\nprogress behind it.\r\n\r\nFirst had come the Earth satellites, eight of them in their neat little\r\norbits. They had used low-energy fuels, had kept close to the Earth,\r\nand no one had seriously expected them to do more than record weather\r\ninformation and relay radio signals. For fifteen years they could be\r\nseen with small telescopes and even with the unaided eye on bright,\r\ncloudless nights in both hemispheres.\r\n\r\nFirst had come these small, relatively unimportant artificial moons and\r\nthen, on a night in October 1972, the first space platform had been\r\nlaunched. Soon the sky above the Earth was swarming with radar warning\r\nplatforms, a dozen men to operate them, and carrier-based jets equipped\r\nwith formidable atomic warheads.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, how could anyone have known that in another twenty years\r\ninterplanetary space flight would become a war-averting reality? How\r\ncould anyone have known that by the year 2007 there would be human\r\nsettlements on Mars and by the year 2022 the actual transportation to\r\nMars of city-building materials?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n\r\nCorriston was beginning to feel uncomfortable. He wished that the girl\r\nwould say something instead of just continuing to stare at him. She\r\nseemed to be interested in his uniform. She appeared to be gazing at\r\nhim interrogatively, as if she wanted to know more about him before\r\npromising anything.\r\n\r\nHe wondered what her unconscious purpose was. Did she see in him\r\nthe quiet, determined type who was all set to accomplish something\r\nimportant. Or was she regretting he wasn't the hard-living, cynical\r\ntype who had been everywhere and done everything?\r\n\r\nWell, one way to find out was to be himself: a man average in every\r\nway, but with a hard core of idealism in his nature, a creative mind\r\nand enough independence and self-assurance to give a good account of\r\nhimself in any struggle which brought his central beliefs under fire\r\nor placed them in long-range jeopardy.\r\n\r\nAnd so Corriston suddenly found himself talking about the Station again.\r\n\r\n\"Not many people have grasped the importance of it yet,\" he said. \"One\r\nstation will service our needs, instead of fifty-seven, one tremendous\r\ncentral terminal and re-fueling depot for _all_ of the ships. Do you\r\nrealize what that could mean?\"\r\n\r\nAbruptly there was a startling warmth in the girl's eyes, an\r\nunmistakable look of interest and encouragement.\r\n\r\n\"Just what could it mean?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Any kind of steady growth across the years leads to centralization, to\r\nbigness. And that bigness becomes time-hallowed and magnified out of\r\nall proportion to its original significance. The Space Station is no\r\nexception. It started with the primitive Earth satellites and branched\r\nout into fifty-seven larger stations. Now it's tremendous, a single\r\ncentral station that can impose its influence in ship clearance matters\r\nwith an almost unanswerable finality.\"\r\n\r\nA shadow had come into the girl's eyes. \"But not completely without\r\nchecks and balances. The Earth Federation can challenge its supremacy\r\nat any point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I'm glad that the challenge remains a factor to be reckoned\r\nwith. As matters stand now the Station's prestige can't be implemented\r\nwith what might well become the iron hand of an intolerable tyranny.\r\nAs matters stand, the Station is actually a big step forward. People\r\nonce talked of centralization as if it were some kind of indecent\r\nhuman bogey. It isn't at all. It's simply a fluid means to an end,\r\na necessary commitment if a society is to achieve greatness. If the\r\nauthority behind the Station respects scientific truth and human\r\ndignity--if it remains empirically minded--I shall serve it to the best\r\nof my ability. No one knows for sure whether what is good outbalances\r\nwhat is bad in any human institution, or any human being. A man can\r\nonly give the best of himself to what he believes in.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry to interrupt,\" an amused voice said, \"but the captain wants\r\nyou to join him in a last-minute celebration: a toast, a press\r\nphotograph--that sort of nonsense. A six hour trip, and he hasn't even\r\nbeen introduced to you. But if you don't appear at his table in ten\r\nminutes he'll throw the book at me.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston looked up in surprise at the big man confronting them. He had\r\napproached so unobtrusively that for an instant Corriston was angry;\r\nbut only for an instant. When he took careful stock of the fellow his\r\nresentment evaporated. There was a cordiality about him which could not\r\nhave been counterfeited. It reached from the breadth of his smile to\r\nhis gray eyes puckered in amusement. He was really big physically, in\r\na wholly genial and relaxed way, and his voice was that of a man who\r\ncould walk up to a bar, pay a bill and leave an everlasting impression\r\nof hearty good nature behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Well, young lady?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not particularly keen about the idea, Jim, but if the captain has\r\nactually iced the champagne, it would be a shame to disappoint him.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston was aware that his companion was getting to her feet. The\r\ninterruption had been unexpected, but much to his surprise he found\r\nhimself accepting it without rancor. If he lost her for a few moments\r\nhe could quickly enough find her again; and somehow he felt convinced\r\nthat the big man was not a torch-carrying admirer.\r\n\r\n\"I'll have to stop off in the ladies' lounge first,\" she said. She\r\nhad opened her vanity case and was making a swift inventory of its\r\ncontents. \"Two shades of lipstick, but no powder! Oh, well.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled at the big man and then at Corriston, gesturing slightly as\r\nshe did so.\r\n\r\n\"We've just been discussing the Station,\" she said. \"This gentleman\r\nhasn't told me his name--\"\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant David Corriston,\" Corriston said quickly. \"My interest in\r\nthe Station is tied in with my job. I've just been assigned to it in\r\nthe very modest capacity of ship's inspection officer, recruit status.\"\r\n\r\nThe big man stared at Corriston more intently, his eyes kindling with\r\na sudden increase of interest. \"Say, I wonder if you could spare\r\nme a few minutes. When my friends ask me I'd like to be able to\r\ntalk intelligently about the terrific headaches the research people\r\nmust have experienced right from the start. The expenditure of fuel\r\nalone....\"\r\n\r\n\"See you in the Captain's cabin, Jim,\" the girl said.\r\n\r\nShe moved out from her chair, her expression slightly constrained. Was\r\nit just imagination, or had the big man's immoderate expansiveness\r\ngrated on her and brought a look of displeasure to her young face?\r\nCorriston couldn't be sure, and his brow remained furrowed as he\r\nwatched her cross the passenger cabin and disappear into the ladies'\r\nlounge.\r\n\r\n\"I'm Jim Clakey,\" the big man said.\r\n\r\nCorriston reseated himself, a troubled indecision still apparent in his\r\nstare. Then gradually he found himself relaxing. He nodded up at the\r\nbig man. \"Sit down, Mr. Clakey,\" he said. \"Ask me anything you want.\r\nSecurity imposes some pretty rigid restrictions, but I'll let you know\r\nwhen you start treading on classified ground.\"\r\n\r\nClakey sat down and crossed his long legs. He was silent for a moment.\r\nThen he said: \"You know who she is, of course.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston shook his head. \"I'm afraid I haven't the slightest idea.\"\r\n\r\n\"She isn't traveling under her real name only because her father is a\r\nvery sensible and cautious man. You'd be cautious too, perhaps, if you\r\nwere Stephen Ramsey.\"\r\n\r\nClakey's gaze had traveled to the ladies' lounge, and for an instant he\r\nseemed unaware of Corriston's incredulous stare.\r\n\r\n\"You mean I've actually been sitting here talking to Stephen Ramsey's\r\ndaughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Clakey said, turning to grin amiably at Corriston.\r\n\"And now you're talking to her personal bodyguard. I'm not surprised\r\nyou didn't recognize her, though; very few people do. She doesn't like\r\nto have her picture taken. Her dad wouldn't object to that kind of\r\npublicity particularly, but she's even more cautious than he is.\"\r\n\r\nThe door of the ladies' lounge opened and two young women came out.\r\nThey were laughing and talking with great animation and were quickly\r\nlost to view as other passengers changed their position in front of the\r\nviewscreen.\r\n\r\nThe door remained visible, however--a rectangle of shining whiteness\r\nonly slightly encroached upon by dark blue drapes. Corriston found\r\nhimself staring at it as his mind dwelt on the startling implications\r\nof Clakey's almost unbelievable statement.\r\n\r\n\"Biggest man on Mars,\" Clakey was saying. \"Cornered uranium; froze out\r\nthe original settlers. They're threatening violence, but their hands\r\nare tied. Everything was done legally. Ramsey lives in a garrisoned\r\nfortress and they can't get within twenty miles of him. He's a damned\r\nscoundrel with tremendous vision and foresight.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston suddenly realized that he had made a serious psychological\r\nblunder in sizing up Clakey. The man was a blabbermouth. True,\r\nCorriston's uniform was a character recommendation which might\r\nhave justified candor to a moderate extent. But Clakey was talking\r\noutrageously out of turn. He was becoming confidential about matters\r\nhe had no right to discuss with anyone on such short acquaintance.\r\nCorriston suddenly realized that Clakey was slightly drunk.\r\n\r\n\"Look here,\" Corriston said. \"You're talking like a fool. Do you know\r\nwhat you're saying?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure I know. Miss Ramsey is a golden girl. And I'm her bodyguard ...\r\nimportant trust ... sop to a man's egoism.\"\r\n\r\nAn astonishing thing happened then. Clakey fell silent and remained\r\nuncommunicative for five full minutes. Corriston had no desire to\r\nstart him talking again. He was appalled and incredulous. He was\r\ndebating the advisability of getting up with a frozen stare and a firm\r\ndetermination to take himself elsewhere when the crazy, loose-tongued\r\nfool leapt unexpectedly to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"She's taking too long!\" he exclaimed. \"It just isn't like her. She'd\r\nnever keep the captain waiting.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, another woman came out of the ladies' lounge. She was\r\nsmall, dark, very pretty, and she seemed a little embarrassed when she\r\nsaw how intently Clakey was staring at her. Then a middle-aged woman\r\ncame out, with a finely-modeled face, and a second, younger woman\r\nwith haggard eyes and a sallow complexion who was in all respects the\r\nopposite of attractive.\r\n\r\n\"She's been in there for fifteen minutes,\" Clakey said, starting toward\r\nthe lounge.\r\n\r\n\"It takes a good many women twice that long to apply makeup properly,\"\r\nCorriston pointed out. \"I just don't see--\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't know her,\" Clakey said, impatiently. \"I may have to ask one\r\nof those women to go in after her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why? You can't seriously believe she's in any danger. We both saw\r\nher go into the lounge. She made the decision on the spur of the moment\r\nand no one could have known about it in advance. No one followed her\r\nin. You were sitting right here watching the door.\"\r\n\r\nBut Clakey was already advancing across the cabin. He was reeling a\r\nlittle, and a dull flush had mounted to his cheekbones. He seemed\r\ngenuinely alarmed. Corriston was about to follow him when something\r\nbright flashed through the air with a faint swishing sound.\r\n\r\nA startled cry burst from Clakey's lips. He clutched at his side,\r\nstaggered, and half-swung about, a look of incredulous horror in his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nCorriston's mouth went dry. He stood very still, watching Clakey lose\r\nall control over his legs. The change in the stricken man's expression\r\nwas ghastly. His cheeks had gone dead white, and now, as Corriston\r\nstared, a spasm convulsed his features, twisting them into a horrible,\r\nunnatural caricature of a human face--a rigidly contorted mask with a\r\nblanched, wide-angled mouth and bulging eyes.\r\n\r\nA passenger saw him and screamed. His knees had given way and his huge\r\nframe seemed to be coming apart at the joints. He straightened out on\r\nthe deck, jerking his head spasmodically, propelling himself backwards\r\nby his elbows. Almost as if with conscious intent, his body arched\r\nitself, sank level with the floor, then arched itself again.\r\n\r\nIt was as though all of his muscles and nerves were protesting the\r\nviolence that had been done to him, and were seeking by muscular\r\ncontractions alone to dislodge the stiff, thorned horror protruding\r\nfrom his flesh.\r\n\r\nHe went limp and the barbed shaft ceased to quiver. Corriston had a\r\nnerve-shattering glimpse of a swiftly spreading redness just above\r\nClakey's right hipbone. The entire barb turned red, as if its feathery\r\nspines had acquired a sudden, unnatural affinity for human blood.\r\n\r\nCorriston started forward, then changed his mind. Several passengers\r\nhad moved quickly to Clakey's side and were bending above him. Someone\r\ncalled out: \"Get a doctor!\"\r\n\r\nCorriston turned abruptly and strode toward the ladies' lounge.\r\nBrushing aside such scruples as he ordinarily would have entertained,\r\nhe threw open the door and went inside.\r\n\r\nHe called out: \"Miss Ramsey?\" When he received no answer he searched\r\nthe lounge thoroughly. There was no one there. He was thinking fast\r\nnow, desperately fast. He hadn't seen her come out and neither had\r\nClakey. He'd seen four women come out: three young women and an elderly\r\none. None of them faintly resembled the girl he'd been talking to.\r\n\r\nThe first young woman had emerged almost immediately. He remembered\r\nhow intently Clakey had been watching the door. Clakey had sat down to\r\ndiscuss the Station with him, and in less than two minutes the first\r\nyoung lady had emerged. Then neither of them had taken their eyes from\r\nthe door for five or six minutes. The second young lady had apparently\r\nknown someone in the crowd. She had seemed annoyed by Clakey's\r\npersistent stare and had disappeared quickly. The elderly woman had\r\nlooked her age. Her walk, her carriage, the lines of her face had borne\r\nthe unmistakable stamp of genteel aging, and the dignity inseparable\r\nfrom it. The last woman had been the drab creature.\r\n\r\nCorriston had a poor memory for faces and he knew that he couldn't\r\ncount on recognizing any of them--except perhaps the elderly woman--if\r\nhe saw them again.\r\n\r\nIt was good that he could smile, even at his own inanities. It relieved\r\ntension. Almost instantly the smile vanished. His aspect became that\r\nof a man in deadly danger on the brink of a hundred foot precipice, a\r\nman completely in the dark and yet grimly determined not to go over the\r\nedge or take a single step in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nWhere, he asked himself, do women ordinarily go when they vanish into\r\nthin air? Wasn't it pretty well established that ghosts were likely to\r\nfollow the path of least resistance and fulfill obligations entered\r\ninto in the flesh?\r\n\r\nThe captain's cabin! The captain would be disappointed if she failed to\r\nappear at least briefly at his table; and she had promised to do so.\r\nIt was a wild, premeditated assault on the rational, but putting the\r\nirrational aspect of it aside, it was also realistic and reasonable.\r\nIf by some incredible miracle she had eluded Clakey's vigilance and\r\nactually slipped from the lounge, she would almost certainly have gone\r\nstraight to the captain's cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nCorriston left the ladies' lounge faster than he had entered it.\r\nHe shut the door firmly and stood for an instant staring at the\r\npassengers who had gathered in an even tighter knot around Clakey and\r\nwere making it difficult for an alarmed young ship's doctor to get to\r\nhim. He was quite sure in his own mind that Clakey would not need the\r\nassistance of a doctor.\r\n\r\nThen he turned and headed for the captain's cabin. Anyone could have\r\ngotten in. The door was ajar and there was no one guarding it. He threw\r\nthe door wide and everything was just as he'd expected to find it: It\r\nwas completely empty.\r\n\r\nNo guests at all to welcome Corriston to the big, empty cabin. Then he\r\nsaw that there was another door opposite.\r\n\r\nCorriston was getting scared, really scared. There was an odd,\r\ndetached, whimsical feeling at the surface of his mind, but it cloaked\r\nsomething distinctly sinister. He had more than half-expected the\r\ncaptain to be absent from his cabin. But something about the silence\r\nand the emptiness chilled him to the core of his being.\r\n\r\nWith an effort he shook the feeling off. He didn't know where the inner\r\ndoor led to. He hesitated for an instant, realizing that the mere\r\nexistence of a second door could complicate his search to the point\r\nof futility. If it led to a second cabin--well and good. But if it\r\ndidn't....\r\n\r\nHe strained his ears to catch the sound of voices. There were no\r\nvoices. He could have simply crossed to the door and looked beyond it.\r\nBut the state of his nerves, and an odd habit he had of being precise\r\nand cautious under tension, made him explore the other possibilities\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThe door might conceivably be a trap. A trap does not have to be\r\ncontrived in advance with some clearly defined purpose in mind.\r\nCircumstances can take a door or a window and turn it into a trap. A\r\nglove or a weapon left lying about can be picked up by an innocent man\r\nand snare him most damnably by seeming to point up his guilt.\r\n\r\nWhat purpose did the inner door serve? Did it open on a corridor\r\nleading back to the general passenger cabin? If it did, it wouldn't be\r\na trap; it would simply have \"blind alley\" stamped all over it.\r\n\r\nCorriston suddenly realized that he was succumbing to a crazy kind of\r\ninaction. The door could lead almost anywhere, and if he had any sense\r\nat all he'd go through it fast.\r\n\r\nGo through it he did, in six long strides. He'd been right about one\r\nthing--the blind alley part. He found himself, in not quite total\r\ndarkness, in what was unquestionably an intership passageway. There was\r\njust light enough for him to make out the shadowy walls on both sides\r\nof him. Rather they were like metal bulkheads that gave off just enough\r\nreflected light for him to see by.\r\n\r\nHe wouldn't have considered ten or twelve seconds spent with a pocket\r\nflash a waste of time. But he had no pocket flash. The best he could do\r\nwas stretch out both of his arms to determine just how far apart the\r\nbulkheads were. They were less than six feet apart.\r\n\r\nWell, no sense in measuring the walls. A girl he'd talked to and liked\r\ninstantly had vanished in a dark world, and he knew now that there was\r\nmore than mere liking in the way he felt about her. He didn't dare ask\r\nhimself how much more, not in so confined a space and with his chances\r\nof finding her again dwindling with every second that passed.\r\n\r\nThe passageway ended in a blank wall, less than forty feet from its\r\nbeginning. Corriston saw the wall and was advancing toward it when he\r\nsuddenly realized that the deck itself wasn't continuous. In his path,\r\nand almost directly underfoot, a companionway entrance yawned, so\r\nunexpectedly close that another short step would have sent him plunging\r\ninto it. He saw the faint light reflected on its circumference and\r\nhalted just in time to avoid a possibly fatal fall.\r\n\r\nHe knelt and stared down into a spiraling web of darkness. He could see\r\na faint glimmer of light on metal and knew that he was bending above\r\neither a circular staircase or a companionway ladder. It turned out\r\nto be a staircase. Down it he went, moving cautiously, holding on to\r\nthe supporting guide rail as he descended deeper and deeper into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nThe darkness became almost absolute when the stairs ended. For a\r\nmoment, at least, what appeared to be utter blackness engulfed him.\r\nThen gradually his vision became more effective. He could make out\r\nthe faint outlines of stationary objects, of depths beyond depths, of\r\ncrisscrossing lines and angles.\r\n\r\nIn utter darkness the glint of metal often seemed to draw the eyes like\r\na magnet, to make itself known even without illumination. But there\r\nseemed to be a faint glow far off somewhere. He couldn't be sure, but\r\nlight there should have been if--as he more than half-suspected--he was\r\nin one of the ship's below-deck ballast or storage compartments.\r\n\r\nThe deck beneath his feet was straight and level and cluttered with no\r\nimpediments. He moved forward warily, testing every step until a wall\r\nof metal stopped him. He halted abruptly, felt along the barrier and\r\nbecame aware that it was studded with small bolts and was just a little\r\ncorrugated. Exhibit A: one supporting metal beam, rough and slightly\r\nuneven in texture. Abruptly he reached the end of it and found himself\r\nunderway again, still moving cautiously to avoid unseen pitfalls. He\r\nhad not progressed more than a dozen feet when he heard the scrape of\r\nfootsteps other than his own, and someone moved up close to him and\r\nblocked his way in the darkness.\r\n\r\nFor an instant the wild thought went through his mind that the someone\r\nwas the captain. But he had seen and talked with the Captain and that\r\nself-contained, blunt-spoken man wasn't nearly as big physically as the\r\npath-blocker seemed to be.\r\n\r\nThe someone did not speak. But Corriston could sense the enmity flowing\r\nfrom him, the utter refusal to budge an inch, the determination to make\r\nhis nearness a deadly threat in itself. Then the someone moved back a\r\nstep. The far-off light could hardly have been an illusion, because for\r\nthe barest instant Corriston could dimly make out the huge bulk of the\r\nman and the glint of the knife in his hand.\r\n\r\nTwo big men in the space of half an hour! The first had ceased to draw\r\nbreath and the second was his killer. Corriston was suddenly sure of\r\nit. He knew it instinctively.\r\n\r\nThen began the struggle which had almost robbed Corriston of his life,\r\nthe cruel, one-sided, impossible-to-win struggle in total darkness.\r\n\r\nAnd Corriston had won it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow almost in disbelief, Corriston looked down at the knife he had\r\ntaken from the loser, telling himself that it was impossible that so\r\nmuch could have happened in so short a time and that he could still be\r\nalive at the end of it.\r\n\r\nThe wound in his shoulder was no longer painless, but it had ceased to\r\nbleed profusely, and his exploring fingers convinced him that the knife\r\nhad severed no more than a superficial ligament. He strained his ears\r\nin the sudden quiet, listening for a possible return of his adversary.\r\nHe did not think that the defeated man would attempt a second attack.\r\nBut there was no telling what he might or might not do. Probably he'd\r\nascended the companionway by now and was mingling with the other\r\npassengers.\r\n\r\nThe final link in Corriston's search had snapped. Even while battling\r\nfor his life, he had felt close to the vanished girl. The man who\r\nhad killed Clakey had been at least a link, a link that, short of\r\nCorriston's total defeat, might have been seized upon with physical\r\nviolence and made to yield up its secret.\r\n\r\nNow Corriston found himself wondering if the defeated man had been\r\ntelling the truth. Had the link been non-existent from the first? Was\r\nthe killer as completely in the dark as he was as to the whereabouts\r\nof Ramsey's daughter?\r\n\r\nIt was difficult to believe that the man had been lying. Despite his\r\nhatred and denials he _had_ offered Corriston a deal: \"_Tell me where\r\nthe girl is and I may not kill you._\" The deal part had been a lie, of\r\ncourse. He would have gone on and attempted to kill Corriston anyway.\r\nBut his plea for information, that tentative, cunning feeler in the\r\ndark had seemed genuine.\r\n\r\nWhat had been the man's purpose in killing Clakey? Why had Clakey been\r\nmurdered in the general passenger cabin, in plain view of the other\r\npassengers? Because the killer had seen the girl go into the lounge and\r\nthought she was still there? And because he wanted free and instant\r\naccess to her, with Clakey out of the way? It was the only answer that\r\nmade sense.\r\n\r\nThe killer must have known that Clakey was in Ramsey's employ and had\r\nbeen guarding Ramsey's daughter. Why then had he been unable to take\r\nadvantage of his crime in any way? Apparently neither he nor a possible\r\nconfederate had succeeded in what almost certainly had been a pattern\r\nof violence directed at Ramsey through his daughter--a plan obviously\r\nworked out in advance, ready to be put into operation the instant a\r\npromising opportunity presented itself.\r\n\r\nInto Corriston's mind flashed an ugly picture of the girl pinioned by\r\nstrong arms and with a handkerchief pressed to her face. She had ceased\r\nto struggle and was being spirited quickly away. The picture became\r\neven more intolerable when he saw her held captive in a cabin difficult\r\nto locate, at the mercy of men without compassion.\r\n\r\nBut for some reason he'd never cease to be thankful for, it hadn't\r\nhappened that way. Something had gone wrong with the plan, and the\r\nkiller didn't even know when and why and how she had vanished. Sharing\r\nCorriston's frustration, he had been struggling simply to save himself,\r\nto keep Corriston from identifying and exposing him. The fury he'd\r\ndisplayed was not difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nCorriston found himself becoming more confident again, less dominated\r\nby despair. The change in his mood surprised him but he seized upon\r\nit gratefully and started building on it. There was only one logical\r\nnext move. He must find the captain quickly and enlist his help. He\r\nmust take the master of the ship fully into his confidence. With every\r\ngift of persuasion at his command, he must make the captain see how the\r\ndanger of Ramsey's daughter was mounting and would continue to mount\r\nwith every minute that she remained unfound.\r\n\r\nHe still felt dizzy, and his head was aching a little, but he moved\r\nquickly through the darkness, his faculties heightened by an intensity\r\nof purpose which enabled him to find the companionway without colliding\r\nwith obstacles or taking a wrong turn. Up the stairway he climbed,\r\nstill clutching the knife, prepared for a possible second encounter\r\nwith its original owner.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to regain the knife by trickery and stealth would not have\r\nsurprised him. In fact, it was not at all difficult for him to picture\r\na silent form flattened against the stair-rail, waiting for just the\r\nright moment to come hurtling toward him out of the darkness. For a\r\nmoment, as he ascended, the strain became almost unendurable. Then the\r\ndarkness dissolved above him, and he was advancing toward the captain's\r\ncabin through the narrow passageway which he had spanned with his arms\r\nspread wide.\r\n\r\nHe did not stop to span it this time. He emerged into the cabin and\r\nstood for an instant blinking in the sudden light. The cabin was still\r\ndeserted. It was anybody's guess where the captain had gone or when he\r\nwould be returning, and Corriston decided not to wait. He walked to the\r\ndoor, opened it and stepped out into the general passenger cabin.\r\n\r\nNo one saw him immediately. There were several passengers fairly close\r\nto him, but they were being attentive for the moment to the words and\r\ngestures of a tall, dignified looking man with observant brown eyes,\r\na ruddy complexion, and gold braid on his shoulders. The tall man was\r\nCaptain John Sanders.\r\n\r\n\"I'd be a hypocrite and a liar if I said there was no justification\r\nfor alarm,\" Sanders was saying, in a voice loud enough to carry to\r\nwhere Corriston was standing. \"Strict regulations prescribe that sort\r\nof thing. But it's no way for a captain to keep the respect of his\r\npassengers.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston felt himself stepping forward before he even thought about\r\nit. But he halted abruptly when the captain said: \"There's a murderer\r\non the loose aboard this ship. You may as well accept that fact right\r\nnow. Each of you has to be on his guard. It's only right and proper\r\nthat you should keep your eyes and ears open, and _stay_ worried. If\r\nyou do, our chances of catching up with him before the ship berths\r\nshould be reasonably good.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain paused, then went on quickly: \"We'll get him eventually.\r\nYou can be sure of that. He'll never get past the inspection each of\r\nyou will have to undergo when we reach the Station. But if we catch him\r\nbefore we reach the Station, you'll be spared an investigative ordeal\r\ndistinctly on the rugged side.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston was suddenly aware that he was being stared at. Everyone was\r\nstaring at him.\r\n\r\n\"My God!\" the Captain cried out, staring the hardest of all. \"Where did\r\nyou get that wound? Who attacked you? And what were you doing in my\r\ncabin?\"\r\n\r\nCorriston walked up to the Captain and said in a voice that trembled\r\na little. \"May I talk to you privately, sir? What I have to say won't\r\ntake long.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\" Sanders demanded. \"That uniform you're wearing makes it\r\nmandatory. All right, come back into my cabin.\"\r\n\r\nThey went back into the cabin. The captain shut the door and turned to\r\nface Corriston with a shocked concern in his stare.\r\n\r\n\"You've had it rough, Lieutenant. I can see that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty rough,\" Corriston conceded. \"But it's not myself I'm worried\r\nabout.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you know that a man has just been murdered?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\n\"With a poisoned barb. A Martian barb. It's a plant found only on Mars.\r\nWe have him stretched out on a table in the sick bay now. But he isn't\r\nsick; he's a corpse. Tell me something, Lieutenant, did you just tangle\r\nwith the man who did it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so,\" Corriston said. \"In fact, I'd stake my commission on it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. Well, you'd better tell me about it. Tell me everything.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston told him.\r\n\r\nThe captain was silent for a long moment. Then he said, \"But we've\r\nno Miss Ramsey on the passenger list. And I certainly didn't invite\r\nher to drink a toast with me in my cabin. Are you sure of your facts,\r\nLieutenant?\"\r\n\r\nCorriston's jaw fell open. He stared at the captain in stunned\r\ndisbelief. \"Of course I'm sure. Why should I lie to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"How should I know? It's unfair to ask me that. If Ramsey's daughter\r\nwas on this ship, you can rest assured I'd have known about it. After\r\nall, Lieutenant--\"\r\n\r\n\"But she _was_ on board and you _didn't_ know. Isn't that obvious?\r\nLook, she was traveling incognito. The trip to the Station takes only\r\nfive hours. Perhaps in so short a trip--\"\r\n\r\n\"No 'perhaps' about it. I'd have known.\"\r\n\r\n\"But she _is_ on board, I tell you. I talked to her. I talked to\r\nClakey. Don't make me go over the whole thing again. We've got to find\r\nher. Ramsey's enemies would stop at nothing. I'm afraid to think of\r\nwhat they might do to his daughter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing will happen to his daughter. She's on Earth right this minute\r\nin her father's house, as safe as any girl that wealthy can ever be.\r\nLieutenant, listen to me. I've got a great deal of respect for that\r\nuniform you're wearing. Don't make me lose it. When you come to me with\r\na story like that--\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. You don't believe me. Will you check the passenger list,\r\njust to be sure?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do more than that, Lieutenant. I'll assemble all of the\r\npassengers and check them off personally. I'll give you an opportunity\r\nto look them over while I'm doing it. Later you can ask them as many\r\nquestions as you wish. There'll be a murderer among them, but that\r\nshouldn't disturb you too much. You've already met. Perhaps you can\r\nidentify him for us. Ask each of the men who made a non-existent Miss\r\nRamsey disappear and the one who turns pale will be our man.\"\r\n\r\nSuddenly the captain reddened. \"I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I didn't mean\r\nto be sarcastic. But a murder on my ship naturally upsets me. I'll be\r\ncompletely frank with you. There's a very remote possibility that Miss\r\nRamsey actually _is_ on board without my knowledge. She hasn't had much\r\npublicity. I believe I've only seen one photograph of her, one taken\r\nseveral years ago. But you've got to remember that a captain is usually\r\nthe first to get wind of such things. It comes to him by a kind of\r\ngrapevine. She's a golden girl--actually the goldenest golden girl on\r\nEarth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Corriston was in a steel-walled cell and the captain's voice seemed\r\nonly a far-off echo sympathizing with him.\r\n\r\nAnd it was an echo, for the captain was gone and he would probably\r\nnever see him again. It was all very simple--that part of it--all very\r\nclear. The captain had faithfully kept his word. The captain hadn't let\r\nhim down. But any man can end up a prisoner when everyone disbelieves\r\nhim and he has no way of proving that he is telling the truth.\r\n\r\nIt was hard to believe that a day and a night had passed, and that\r\nthe Captain _had_ kept his word and gone ahead with the roll call. It\r\nwas even harder to believe that he, Corriston, was no longer on the\r\nship, but in a sanity cell on the Space Station, and that the ship was\r\ntraveling back toward Earth.\r\n\r\nHe shut his eyes, and the events of the past thirty hours unrolled\r\nbefore him with a nightmare clarity, and yet with all of the monstrous\r\ndistortions which a nightmare must of necessity evoke.\r\n\r\nDarkness and time and space. And closer at hand the frowns of\r\nforthright, honest men appalled by mental abnormality in a new recruit,\r\nan officer with a steel-lock determination to keep the truth securely\r\nguarded and safe from all distortion.\r\n\r\nThere had come the tap on his shoulder and a stern voice saying: \"You'd\r\nbetter come with us, Lieutenant.\" He had just told the captain the\r\nwhole horrible story. He had not been believed.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me about it,\" said the recruit in the bunk opposite Corriston.\r\n\"It will help you to talk. Remember, we're not prisoners. We mustn't\r\nthink of ourselves as prisoners. We can go out and exercise. We can\r\nwalk around the Station for a half-hour or so. We've only got to\r\npromise we'll come back and lock ourselves in. They trust us. It could\r\nhappen to anyone.\r\n\r\n\"Space-shock. Not a fancy word at all. I'm getting over it; you've a\r\ncertain distance to go. Or so they say. But we're still in very much\r\nthe same boat and talking always helps. Talk to me, Lieutenant, the way\r\nyou did last night.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston looked at the pale youth opposite him. He had close-cropped\r\nhair and friendly blue eyes, and he seemed a likeable enough lad.\r\nHe was Corriston's junior by several years. But there was an aura\r\nof neuroticism about him that made Corriston uneasy. But hell, why\r\nshouldn't he get it off his chest. Talking just _might_ help.\r\n\r\n\"It's true,\" Corriston said. \"Every word of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you, Lieutenant. But quite obviously _they_ didn't. Why\r\nnot strike a compromise. Say I'm one-tenth wrong in believing you and\r\nthey're nine-tenths right in not believing you. That means there may be\r\nsome little quirk in what happened to you that doesn't quite fit into\r\nthe normal pattern. Put that down to space-shock--a mild case of it.\r\nI'm not saying you have it, but you could have it.\"\r\n\r\nThe kid was grinning now, and Corriston had to like him.\r\n\r\n\"Okay,\" he said. \"You can believe this or not. The captain lined all\r\nof the passengers up and checked them off by their cabin numbers. I\r\n_didn't_ see her. Do you understand? She just wasn't there! I thought\r\nI recognized two of the women who had come out of the ladies' lounge,\r\nbut I couldn't even be sure of that. One of the two denied ever having\r\nstepped inside the lounge, and the other was vague about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"The captain really sailed into me for a moment, lost his temper\r\ncompletely. 'A fine officer you are, Lieutenant. It's painful to be\r\non the same ship with the kind of officers the training schools turn\r\nout when the Station finds itself short of personnel. Is the Station\r\nplanning to trust ships' clearance to hallucinated personnel?\r\n\r\n\"'All right, you talked to a girl--some girl. She didn't even tell you\r\nshe was Ramsey's daughter; Clakey told you. And he's dead. Not only\r\nis he dead, he wasn't listed on the passenger list as Clakey at all.\r\nHis name was Henry Ewers. I don't know what you believed, Lieutenant.\r\nI don't care what you think you saw. You tangled with someone and he\r\nstabbed you. _He_ was real enough ... obviously the man who killed\r\nEwers. But you let him get away, so even that isn't too much to your\r\ncredit.'\"\r\n\r\n\"If I had been you,\" the kid said, \"I've had knocked him down.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" For the first time Corriston smiled. \"To tell you the truth, the\r\ncaptain is a good guy. He's one of those blunt, moody, terribly human\r\nindividuals you encounter occasionally, men who speak their minds on\r\nall occasions and are instantly sorry they did. You have to like them\r\neven when they seem to insult you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He made up for it then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll say he did. He knew that when we landed the officials would be\r\nbreathing right down my neck. He wanted to give me every chance. So he\r\nkept the officials away from me until I'd convinced myself Ramsey's\r\ndaughter just couldn't be on board.\r\n\r\n\"He let me look at every piece of luggage that was taken off the ship.\r\nHe had some cargo to unload and he let me inspect that too, every\r\ncrate. Most of the crates were too small to conceal a drugged and\r\nunconscious girl--or any girl for that matter. The ones that weren't,\r\nhe opened for me and let me look inside.\r\n\r\n\"He let me watch every passenger leave the ship. Then, when all of\r\nthe passengers had left, he stationed officers in the three main\r\npassageways and I went through the ship from bow to stern. I went into\r\nevery stateroom and into every intership compartment. No one could\r\nhave kept just a little ahead of me or behind me, dodging back into a\r\ncompartment the instant I'd vacated it. They would have been instantly\r\nspotted by one of the officers.\r\n\r\n\"The Captain wasn't to blame at all for what happened later ... when I\r\ntried to convince the commanding officers here that I was completely\r\nsane.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. He must have really liked you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess he did. And I liked him.\"\r\n\r\nThe kid nodded. \"And the murderer's still at large. That makes it rough\r\nfor the sixty odd passengers they're holding in quarantine. How long do\r\nyou think they'll hold them in the Big Cage?\"\r\n\r\n\"As long as they can. They'll keep them under close guard and increase\r\ntheir vigilance every time there's a suspicious move in the cage.\r\nThey'll be screened perhaps a dozen times. But most of them are\r\ninfluential people. Most of them have booked passage on the Mars' run\r\nliner that's due here next week. They can't hold them forever. They'd\r\nstart pulling wires on Earth by short wave and there'd be a legislative\r\nuproar.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they refuse to let them send messages?\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't refuse. I'm sure of that.\"\r\n\r\nThe kid was thoughtful for a moment. Then he said: \"Tell me more about\r\nRamsey. Just what do you think is happening on Mars?\"\r\n\r\n\"No one knows exactly what is happening,\" Corriston said. \"But to the\r\nbest of my knowledge the overall picture is pretty ugly. The original\r\nsettlers have their backs to the wall with a vengeance. Now there are\r\narmed guards at their throats. Ramsey has taken over. He has resorted\r\nto legal trickery to freeze them out.\r\n\r\n\"There are perhaps fifty important uranium claims on Mars and Ramsey\r\nhas consolidated all of the holdings into a single major enterprise. To\r\nsay that he's cornered the market in uranium would be understating the\r\ncase. He has taken possession by right of seizure, and the colonists\r\ncan't get to him. They're living a hand-to-mouth existence while he\r\nlives in a heavily guarded stronghold behind three miles of electrified\r\ndefenses.\"\r\n\r\nThe kid nodded again. \"Yes, that's the picture when you unscramble\r\nit, I guess. But most of it is kept hidden from the general run of\r\ntourists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally. Ramsey has the power to keep it under wraps.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think the colonists had anything to do with Clakey's murder\r\nand Miss Ramsey's disappearance? Or I guess I should say Henry Ewers'\r\nmurder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clakey, Ewers--his name doesn't matter. I'm convinced that he was Miss\r\nRamsey's bodyguard.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you haven't answered my question.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can't answer it with any certainty. Did the colonists hire a killer\r\nand book passage for him on the ship? It's difficult to believe that\r\nthe kind of men who colonized Mars would resort to murder.\"\r\n\r\n\"But there are a few scoundrels in every large group of men. And what\r\nif they became so desperate they felt they had to fight fire with fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I'd thought of that. It may be the answer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nA half-hour later the kid was taken away and Corriston found himself\r\ncompletely alone. There are few events in human life more unnerving\r\nthan the totally unexpected removal of a sympathetic listener when dark\r\nthoughts have taken possession of a man.\r\n\r\nThe kid wasn't forcibly removed from the cell. He left without\r\nprotesting and no rough hands were laid on him, no physical violence\r\nemployed. But he was not at all eager to leave, and if the guards who\r\ncame for him had eyed him less severely, his attitude might have been\r\nthe opposite of complacent.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, kid,\" one of them said. \"Your discharge has been postponed.\r\nSomebody on the psycho-staff wants to give you another test. I guess\r\nyou didn't interpret the ink blots right.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at Corriston and shook his head sympathetically. \"It's tough,\r\nI know. Once you're here waiting to be released can wear you down. I\r\nshouldn't be saying this, but it stands to reason it might even slow\r\nup your recovery a bit. It's easy to blame the docs, but you've got to\r\ntry to understand their side of it. They have to make sure.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the door clanged shut behind the kid, Corriston crossed to his\r\ncot, sat down, and cradled his head in his arms. The fact that he was\r\nstill free to go outside and walk around the Station was no comfort\r\nat all. That kind of freedom could be worse than total confinement.\r\nHe could never hope to escape from observation. The guards were under\r\norders to watch him, and wherever he turned there'd be eyes boring into\r\nthe back of his neck.\r\n\r\nOn Earth a man under surveillance could duck quickly into a side\r\nstreet, run and weave about, and emerge on a broad avenue in the midst\r\nof a crowd. He could walk calmly then for a block or two, and turn in\r\nat a bar. He could drown his troubles in drink.\r\n\r\nThere were bars on the Station, of course. But Corriston knew that if\r\nhe tried to mingle with officers of his own rank on the upper levels,\r\nhe'd quickly enough find himself drinking alone. He could picture the\r\noff-duty personnel edging quickly and resentfully away from him, as\r\nthough he'd suddenly appeared in their midst with a big, yawning hole\r\nin his skull.\r\n\r\nSuddenly utter weariness overcame Corriston. He loosened his belt,\r\nelevated his legs, and relaxed on the cot.\r\n\r\nHe was asleep almost before he could close his eyes. How long he\r\nslept he had no way of knowing. He only knew that he was awakened by\r\na sound--the strangest sound a man could hear in space. It was as if\r\na gnat or a mosquito had developed a sudden, avaricious liking for\r\nhis blood-type and was determined to gorge itself to bursting at his\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe buzzing seemed to go on interminably as he hovered between sleeping\r\nand waking. On and on and on, with absolutely no letup. Then, abruptly,\r\nit ceased. There was a faint swishing sound and something solid thudded\r\ninto the hardwood directly above him.\r\n\r\nWith a startled cry Corriston leapt from the cot, caught the iron edge\r\nof the bed-guard to keep from falling, and stared up in horror at the\r\nshining expanse of wall space overhead.\r\n\r\nThe cell was in almost total darkness. But from the barred window\r\nopposite, a faint glimmer of light penetrated in a diffuse arc, just\r\nenough light to enable him to make out the quivering stem of the barb.\r\n\r\nIt _was_ a barb. This was so beyond any possibility of doubt. It had\r\nlodged in the hardwood scarcely a foot above his cot and it was still\r\nquivering.\r\n\r\nCold sweat broke out on Corriston's palms as he realized how close\r\ndeath had come, and how almost miraculous had been his escape. Had he\r\nraised himself to slap at the \"mosquito\" the barb could just as easily\r\nhave buried itself in his skull.\r\n\r\nCorriston hesitated for an instant, his eyes on the barred window and\r\nthe faint glow beyond. Then his gaze passed to the wall switch. He\r\ndecided against switching on the light immediately. He stooped low and\r\nmoved quickly to the window, taking care to keep his head well below\r\nthe sill.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he listened, his every nerve alert. There was no stir of\r\nmovement in the darkness beyond the sill, nothing at all to indicate\r\nthat someone was crouching there.\r\n\r\nFinally, with an almost foolhardy recklessness, he raised his head and\r\nstared out between the bars. He could see right across to the wall\r\nopposite. The wall was less than eight feet away, and the space between\r\nthe wall and his cell appeared to be unoccupied. This did not surprise\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIt was utterly silly to think that a man intent on willful murder would\r\nhave lingered for any great length of time in so narrow a space. After\r\nhaving shot his bolt, his immediate concern would have been to get away\r\nas quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nNo, definitely, the man was gone, and if he had more barbs to release\r\nhe would choose another time and place.\r\n\r\nEven then Corriston did not switch on the light. He had no particular\r\ndesire to examine the wood-embedded barb in a bright light. He could\r\nsee it clearly enough from where he stood. It was exactly like the barb\r\nwhich had sealed the lips of that blabbermouth Clakey.\r\n\r\nCorriston went back to his cot and sat down. He told himself it would\r\nbe highly dangerous to leave the cell and give the killer another\r\nchance. He had saved himself by refusing to slap a non-existent\r\nmosquito. But in the shadows of the Station there would be no\r\nmosquitoes--non-existent or otherwise. The killer would simply crouch\r\nin shadows, await his chance, and take careful aim.\r\n\r\nWhat he had to do was find Miss Ramsey, and prove his sanity. If he\r\nstayed in the cell, the shadows would continue to deepen about him,\r\nwould become intolerable, and perhaps even drive him to the verge of\r\nactual madness.\r\n\r\nHe had to convince the killer that he couldn't be silenced easily and\r\nperhaps not at all.\r\n\r\nCorriston stood up. He ran his hands down his body, taking pride in its\r\nmuscular solidity, its remarkable integrity under strain. He still felt\r\nlithe and confident; his physical vitality was unimpaired.\r\n\r\nHe had really known all along that he would be leaving the cell. On\r\nEarth you could dodge into a narrow alley between tall buildings\r\nor lean on a stroller platform and be carried underground so fast\r\nthat your pursuers would be left blank-faced. If he stayed alert he\r\ncould do the same thing on the Station, even though there were no\r\nmoving pavements to leap upon. Quite possibly he could even slip out\r\nunnoticed. They might not even be watching the cell door because he\r\nhad behaved himself so well up to now. Psycho-cases were permitted to\r\nroam, but if they stayed in their cells precautions would naturally be\r\nrelaxed in their favor.\r\n\r\nCorriston now was about to develop a sudden, unanticipated impulse to\r\nroam. The fact that he was completely sane gave him an edge over the\r\nspace-shocked recruits. There is nothing quite so terrifying to a man\r\nwho doubts his own sanity than the thought that unseen eyes are keeping\r\ntabs on him. He feels guilty and acts guilty and almost invariably his\r\ncaution deserts him.\r\n\r\nCorriston was quite sure that he could carry it off, even if he felt\r\neyes boring into his back the instant he left the cell. He'd simply\r\nbide his time and seize the first opportunity which presented itself.\r\n\r\nActually, it was easier than he'd imagined it could be. He simply\r\nopened the cell door, walked out; and there was no one in sight to\r\nobserve him. So far, so good. The corridor outside was completely\r\ndeserted, and when he reached the end of it there was still no one.\r\n\r\nHe turned left into a large, square reception room and crossed it\r\nwithout hurrying, his shoulders held straight. Photoelectric eyes? Yes,\r\npossibly, but he had no intention of letting the thought worry him. If\r\nhe were being watched mechanically, there was nothing he could do about\r\nit and somehow he didn't think that he had crossed any photoelectric\r\nbeams. Certainly no doors had swung open or closed behind him, and\r\nphotoelectric alarm system without visible manifestations could be\r\ndismissed as a not too likely possibility.\r\n\r\nWhen Corriston emerged in the glass-encased, wide-view observation\r\npromenade on the Station's Second Level, he was no longer alone. On\r\nall sides men and women jostled him, walking singly and in pairs,\r\nin uniform and in civilian clothes, or hurrying off in dun-gray,\r\nspace-mechanic anonymity.\r\n\r\nThe promenade was crowded almost to capacity and yet the men and women\r\nseemed mere walking dots scattered at random beneath the immense\r\nstructures of steel and glass which walled them in. A feeling of\r\nunreality came upon Corriston as he stared upward. He deliberately\r\nmoderated his stride, as if fearful that a too rapid movement in\r\nany one direction might send him spinning out into space with a\r\nglass-shattering impetus which he would be powerless to control.\r\n\r\nIt was an illogical fear and yet he could not entirely throw it off,\r\nand he did not seriously try. It was not nearly as important as the\r\npossibility that he might be being followed. There was no one behind\r\nhim who looked in the least suspicious, and no one in front of him\r\neither. But how could he be completely sure?\r\n\r\nThe answer was that he couldn't. He had to trust his instincts, and so\r\nfar they had given him every assurance that he was moving in a free,\r\nindependent orbit of his own, completely unobserved.\r\n\r\nAnd then, quite suddenly, he ceased to move at all.\r\n\r\nSomething quite startling was taking place throughout the length\r\nand breadth of the observation promenade. The men in uniform were\r\nexchanging alarmed glances and departing in haste. The civilians were\r\ncrowding closer to the panes. They were collecting in awestruck groups\r\nof blinding light crisscrossed high above their heads.\r\n\r\nThey were all looking in one direction, but a few of them had been\r\ntaken so completely by surprise that they stood motionless in the\r\nmiddle of the promenade. Corriston was one of the motionless ones, but\r\nhis eyes were quick to seek out the nearest viewpane.\r\n\r\nAt first he thought that a gigantic meteor had appeared suddenly out\r\nof the stellar dark and was rushing straight toward the Station with a\r\nvelocity so great as to be almost unimaginable.\r\n\r\nThen he realized that it wasn't a meteor. It was a spaceship. And it\r\nwasn't rushing straight toward the Station. It had either bypassed or\r\nencircled the Station and passed beyond it, for it was now heading\r\nout into space again. He could see the long, bright trail left by its\r\nrocket jets, the diffuse incandescence in its wake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6\r\n\r\n\r\nAn officer with two stripes on his shoulder was standing almost at\r\nCorriston's elbow. He hadn't turned to depart, and for some reason he\r\nseemed reluctant to do so. The space-ship's erratic course seemed to\r\nabsorb him to the exclusion of all else.\r\n\r\nHe started swearing under his breath. Then he saw Corriston and a\r\nstrange look came into his face. He looked at Corriston steadily for a\r\nmoment, then looked quickly away.\r\n\r\nCorriston edged slowly away from him and joined the nearest group of\r\ncivilians. They were all talking at once and it was hard to understand\r\nprecisely what they were saying. But after a moment a few enlightening\r\nfragments of information greatly lessened his bewilderment.\r\n\r\n\"_That freighter was preparing to land at the Station, but for some\r\nreason it couldn't make contact. It never even began to decelerate._\"\r\n\r\n\"_How do you know?_\"\r\n\r\n\"_I asked one of the officers--that gray-haired man over there. He was\r\nplenty worried. I guess that's why he talked so freely. He'd had some\r\nkind of dispute with the captain, apparently. He told me that trouble\r\ndeveloped aboard that freighter when it was eight or ten thousand\r\nmiles away. An emergency message came through, but for some reason the\r\ncaptain kept it pretty much to himself._\"\r\n\r\nWatching the freighter's hull blaze with friction as it went into a\r\nnarrow orbit about Earth, Corriston tried hard to make himself believe\r\nthat the particular manner of a spaceman's departure was simply one,\r\ntragic aspect of a calculated risk, that men who lived dangerously\r\ncould hardly expect to die peacefully in their beds. But it was a\r\nrationalization without substance. In an immediate and very real sense\r\nhe was inside the freighter, enduring an eternity of torment, sharing\r\nthe agonizing fate that was about to overtake the crew.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer to Earth the freighter swept, completely encircling\r\nthe planet like a runaway moon with an orbital velocity so great the\r\neye could hardly follow it.\r\n\r\n\"It will blast out a meteor pit as wide as the Grand Canyon if it\r\nexplodes on land,\" someone at Corriston's elbow said. \"I wouldn't care\r\nto be within a hundred miles of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither would I. It could wipe out a city, all right--any city within\r\na radius of thirty miles. This is _really_ something to watch!\"\r\n\r\nThe freighter had encircled Earth twice and was now so close to its\r\nblue-green oceans and the dun-colored immensity of its continental land\r\nmasses that it had almost disappeared from view. It had dwindled to a\r\ntiny, glowing pinpoint of radiance crossing the face of the planet,\r\nan erratically weaving firefly that had abandoned all hope of guiding\r\nitself by a light that was about to flare up with explosive violence\r\nand put an end to its life.\r\n\r\nThe freighter was invisible when the end came. It was invisible when\r\nit struck and rebounded and channeled a deep pit in a green valley on\r\nEarth. But the explosion which followed was seen by every man and woman\r\non the Station's wide-view promenade.\r\n\r\nThere were three tremendous flares, each opening and spreading outward\r\nlike the sides of a funnel, each a livid burst of incandescence\r\nspiraling outward into space.\r\n\r\nAs seen from the Station the flares were not, of course, so tragically\r\nspectacular. They resembled more successive flashes of almost\r\ninstantaneous brightness, flashes such as had many times been produced\r\nby the tilting of a heliograph on the rust-red plains of Mars under\r\nconditions of maximum visibility.\r\n\r\nIt takes an experienced eye to interpret such phenomena correctly, and\r\namong the spectators on the promenade there were a few, no doubt, who\r\nwere not even quite sure that the freighter _had_ exploded.\r\n\r\nBut Corriston had no doubts at all on that score. The full extent of\r\nthe tragedy would be revealed later by radio communication from Earth.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence before anyone spoke. The group around\r\nCorriston seemed paralyzed by shock, unable to express in words how\r\nblindly hopeful they had dared to be, or how fatalistic from the\r\nfirst. There were a few moist eyes among the women, an awkward, almost\r\nreverent shuffling of feet.\r\n\r\nThen the young man at Corriston's elbow cleared his throat and said in\r\na barely audible whisper: \"It didn't come down in the sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" Corriston said. \"It came down in North America, close to the\r\nCanadian border.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the United States?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I think so. We can't be sure. It's too much to hope there was no\r\ndestruction of human life after an explosion of that magnitude.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston suddenly realized that he was behaving like a man who\r\nhad taken complete leave of his wits. He was drawing more and more\r\nattention to himself when he should have been bending all of his\r\nefforts toward making himself as inconspicuous as possible.\r\n\r\nFortunately the agitation of everyone on the promenade was helping to\r\nremedy his blunder. His wisest course now was simply to recede as an\r\nindividual, to move silently to the perimeter of the group and just as\r\nsilently vanish.\r\n\r\nHe was confident that he could accomplish it. He began elbowing his\r\nway backwards until there were a dozen men and women in front of him.\r\nHe let himself be observed briefly as a grim-lipped spectator who\r\nhad taken such an emotional pounding that he could endure no more.\r\nSuddenly he saw his chance and took it. There was another small group\r\nof civilians close to the group he had joined, and he ducked quickly\r\nbehind them, using their turned-away backs as a shield. He edged\r\ntoward a paneled door on his right, his only concern for the moment\r\nbeing a comparatively simple one. He must get away from the crowded\r\npromenade as swiftly as possible.\r\n\r\nHe reached the door, swung the panel wide, and stepped into the long,\r\nbrightly-lighted compartment beyond without a backward glance. Almost\r\nimmediately he perceived that he had committed an act of folly. The\r\ncompartment was a promenade cafeteria and it was crowded with an\r\noverflow of agitated men and women discussing the tragedy in heated\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n_Keep cool now. None of these people are interested in you. Keep cool\r\nand keep on walking. There's another door and you can be through it in\r\nless than a minute_, Corriston told himself.\r\n\r\nThere was a pretty waitress behind the long counter, and as he came\r\nabreast of her she smiled at him. For an instant he hesitated, eyed\r\nthe stool opposite her, and fought off an incongruous but almost\r\nirresistible impulse to sit down. Quick warmth and sudden sympathy.\r\nYes, he could do with a bit of both, Corriston thought.\r\n\r\nIt was sheer insanity, but he _did_ sit down. He eased himself into the\r\nstool and ordered a cup of coffee.\r\n\r\n\"Something with it?\" the waitress asked. \"A sandwich, or--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no, I don't think so,\" Corriston said quickly. \"Just the coffee.\"\r\n\r\nThe waitress seemed in no hurry to depart. \"It was pretty terrible what\r\nhappened. Wasn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you see it?\" Corriston asked.\r\n\r\n\"I saw most of it. I saw the ship go past the Station and start to\r\nexplode. I saw that black wing, or whatever it was, drop off. Then\r\nsomeone started shouting in here and I came back. They say it crashed\r\non Earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right,\" Corriston said, telling himself that he was a damned\r\nfool for wanting to look at her hair and hear her friendly woman's\r\nvoice when every passing second was adding to his danger.\r\n\r\n\"You saw it crash?\"\r\n\r\nCorriston nodded. \"I just came from the promenade.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a crazy thing to ask you. How excited can you get? I saw you\r\ncome through that door. You looked kind of pale.\"\r\n\r\n\"I still feel that way,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\nThe waitress then said a surprising thing: \"I wonder what it is about\r\nsome men. You just have to look at them once and you know they're the\r\nsort you'd like to be with when something terrible happens. You know\r\nwhat I mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Corriston said. \"Any port in a storm.\"\r\n\r\nThe waitress smiled again. \"I don't mean that, exactly. Please don't\r\nthink I'm handing you a line. There's just something ... comfortable\r\nabout you. You go all pale when something bad happens to other people.\r\nThat's good; I like that. It means you can feel for other people.\r\nYou're a gentle sort of guy, but I bet you can take care of yourself\r\nand anyone you care about. I just bet you can.\"\r\n\r\nThe waitress flushed a little, as if afraid that she had said too much.\r\nShe turned and walked slowly toward the coffee percolator at the far\r\nend of the counter.\r\n\r\nHe was glad now that he had ordered the coffee. The coffee would help\r\ntoo. He suddenly felt that he was under observation, that hostile eyes\r\nwere watching him. But it was no more than just a feeling; and coffee\r\nand sympathy might drive it away.\r\n\r\n_How blindly, stupidly foolish could a guy be?_ Corriston thought. _If\r\nhe had any sense at all he wouldn't wait for the coffee. He'd get up\r\nquickly and head for the door at the other end of the cafeteria. He'd\r\neither do that, or swing about abruptly and attempt to catch the silent\r\nwatcher by surprise._\r\n\r\nCorriston decided to wait for the coffee.\r\n\r\nThe waitress looked at him strangely when she returned. She set the\r\ncoffee down before him and started to turn away, her eyes troubled.\r\nThen, suddenly, she seemed to change her mind. She leaned close to him\r\nand whispered: \"You'd better leave by the promenade door. That man over\r\nthere has been watching you. I know him very well. He's a Security\r\nGuard.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston nodded and stared at her gratefully for a moment. He was\r\nmore relieved than alarmed. It was far better to have a Security Guard\r\nwatching him than a killer with a poisoned barb. He wasn't exactly\r\nhappy about it, but he was confident he could elude the agent.\r\n\r\nThe waitress' eyes were suddenly warm and friendly again.\r\n\"Space-shock?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"So they claim,\" Corriston said. \"I happen to think they're mistaken.\"\r\n\r\nHe started sipping the coffee. It was hot but not steaming hot. He\r\ncould have tossed it off like a jigger of rye but he had some quick\r\nthinking to do.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" he said. \"Just where is that guard sitting?\"\r\n\r\n\"At the other end of the counter,\" the waitress replied, the anxiety\r\ncoming back into her eyes. \"He's close to the door. You'd have to go\r\npast him. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think you want to get away from him.\r\nSo you'd better go the way you came--by the promenade door.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not too good an idea, I'm afraid,\" Corriston said. \"He'd follow\r\nme and get assistance on the promenade. What's beyond the other door?\r\nWhere does it lead to?\"\r\n\r\n\"It opens on a corridor,\" the waitress said quickly. \"If you can get\r\npast him you might have a better chance that way. There's nothing but a\r\ncorridor with two side doors. One opens on an emergency stairway that\r\ngoes down to the Master Sequence Selector compartments.\"\r\n\r\nShe seemed to take pride in her knowledge. Due to a space-shocked guy's\r\ndifficulties, the Master Sequence Selector had become an important\r\nsecret shared between them. Corriston wondered if she knew that the\r\nSelector functioned on thirty-two separate kinds of automatic controls.\r\n\r\nIf he ever got the chance, he'd come back and tell her exactly how\r\ngrateful he was. Right at the moment one consideration alone dominated\r\nhis thinking. If he could get past the guard he could hide out in an\r\nintricate maze of machinery. Even if they sent a dozen guards down\r\nto look for him it would take them some time to locate him. He could\r\nhide-out and gain a breathing spell.\r\n\r\nThe waitress had a very small hand. Abruptly Corriston clasped it and\r\nheld it for an instant, his fingers exerting a firm, steady pressure.\r\n\"Thanks,\" he said.\r\n\r\nCorriston swung about without glancing toward the end of the counter.\r\nHe'd pass the guard quickly enough; there was no sense in alerting\r\nthe man in advance. As for recognizing him, that would be no problem\r\nat all. You couldn't mistake a Security Guard no matter what kind of\r\nclothes he wore.\r\n\r\nCorriston took his time. He walked slowly, refusing to hurry. A man\r\nunder surveillance should never hurry. He should be casual, completely\r\nat his ease, for there is no better way of keeping an observer guessing.\r\n\r\nHe kept parallel with the long counter, his shoulders swaying a little\r\nwith the assurance of a man who knows exactly where he is going.\r\nPresently the entire length of the counter was behind him, and he was\r\nless than a yard from the door.\r\n\r\nHe hadn't glanced once at the counter. He didn't intend to now. One\r\nquick leap would carry him through the door and beyond it, and to hell\r\nwith recognizing the guard. When it was touch and go and odd man out,\r\nyou altered your plan as you went along.\r\n\r\nHe'd seen a girl disappear when everyone said it didn't happen.\r\nConfined to a psycho-ward, he had simply walked out, eluded a killer,\r\nand watched a ship explode on the green hills of Earth. He'd survived\r\nall that, so how could one lone Security Guard stop him now?\r\n\r\nHe was preparing to leap, when something got in his way--a shadow--a\r\nshadow for an instant between himself and the door, and then a dark\r\nbulk stepping right into the shoes of the shadow and filling it out.\r\n\r\nThe Security Guard was not at all the kind of person he'd expected\r\nhim to be. He was not a big ape, not even a muscular-looking man. He\r\nhad simply seemed big for the instant he took to fill the place of\r\nhis shadow. He was a man of average height, average build. He blocked\r\nthe doorway without bluster, looking very calm and relaxed. Only his\r\neyes were cold and accusing and dangerously narrowed as he surveyed\r\nCorriston from head to foot.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid you'll have to go back to the ward now,\" he said. \"You\r\npicked a bad time to take a turn about the Station. Ordinarily you'd\r\nbe privileged to do so. That's part of the therapy. But you picked a\r\n_very_ bad time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm beginning to realize that,\" Corriston said. \"I couldn't help it,\r\nthough. I had no way of knowing that freighter was out of control. I'm\r\nafraid you've made a mistake, too, though. I'm not going back to the\r\ncell.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston had been watching the man's right arm. Suddenly it went back\r\nand his fist started rising, started coming up fast at an angle that\r\ncould have sent it crashing against Corriston's jaw.\r\n\r\nCorriston had no intention of letting that happen. He side-stepped\r\nquickly and delivered a smashing blow to the pit of the guard's\r\nstomach. The blow was so solid that it doubled the guard up. His knees\r\nbuckled and he started to fold.\r\n\r\nCorriston didn't take the folding for granted. A second blow caught the\r\nman squarely on the jaw and a third thudded into his rib section. For\r\nan instant he looked so dazed that Corriston felt sorry for him.\r\n\r\nHe was still half-doubled up when he sank to the floor and straightened\r\nout. He straightened out on his side first, and then rolled over on his\r\nback and stopped moving. His lips hung slackly, his eyes were wide and\r\nstaring.\r\n\r\nThe look on his face gave Corriston a jolt. It was a very strange\r\nlook. The fact that his features had become slack was not startling\r\nin itself, but there was something unnatural, unbelievable, about the\r\nway that muscular relaxation had overspread his entire countenance. His\r\nfeatures were putty-gray and they seemed to have no clearly defined\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\nHis nose, eyes, and forehead looked as if the ligaments which held them\r\ntogether had snapped from overstrain or had been severed by a surgeon's\r\nscalpel ... severed and allowed to go their separate ways without\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nIn fact, there was no real expression on the man's face at all--no\r\nrecognizably human expression--not even the stuporous look of a man\r\nknocked suddenly unconscious.\r\n\r\nThere was agitation now in the cafeteria, a hum of angry voices, a\r\nrising murmur that was coming dangerously close. Corriston shut his\r\nmind to it. He knelt at the guard's side and swiftly unbuttoned the\r\nunconscious man's heavy service jacket. He felt around under the jacket\r\nuntil he was satisfied that he could move on through the doorway with\r\na clear conscience. The guard's heart was beating firmly and steadily.\r\nThere was a reassuring warmth under the jacket as well, a complete\r\nabsence of clamminess.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the guard groaned and started to roll over on his side again.\r\nCorriston didn't wait for him to complete the movement. He arose\r\nquickly and was through the door in four long strides.\r\n\r\nHe preferred not to run. He was not so much fleeing as seeking a\r\nsecurity he was entitled to, a reasonably safe port in a storm that was\r\nthreatening to take away his freedom by blanketing him in a dark cloud\r\nof unjust suspicion and utter tyranny.\r\n\r\nThe corridor was as deserted as he'd hoped it would be. With no one\r\nto get in his way or sound an alarm, he had no difficulty at all in\r\nlocating the emergency passageway which descended in a rail-guarded\r\nspiral to the Master Sequence Selector. He kept his right hand on the\r\nsafety rail as he moved downward into the darkness. For the first time\r\nhe felt extremely tired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drone of machinery in a high-vaulted, metal-walled compartment\r\nawakened Corriston. It was for the most part a steady, low, continuous\r\nsound. But occasionally it ceased to be a drone, in a strict sense,\r\nand became high-pitched. It became a shrill, almost intolerable whine,\r\nimpinging unpleasantly on his eardrums and preventing him from going to\r\nsleep again.\r\n\r\nFor interminable minutes he lay stretched out at full length in the\r\nlidded, coffinlike rag bin into which he had crawled, a lethargic\r\nweariness enveloping him like a shroud. Above his head steel-blue\r\nsurfaces crisscrossed, vibrating planes of metal and wire intricately\r\nfolded back upon themselves.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment, when the steady drone was well in the ascendency again,\r\nhe sat up and stared about him. He had a throbbing headache and there\r\nwas a dryness in his throat which made swallowing difficult.\r\n\r\nHe was certainly not an exceptional man in regard to such matters.\r\nDuring moments of crises he could remain fairly calm and self-possessed\r\nbut the aftermath could be killing.\r\n\r\nHe felt now as if all of his nerves had been squeezed together in a\r\nvise. He looked at his wrist watch and was amazed to discover that he\r\nhad slept for eight hours. If a search had been made for him, he had no\r\nreason to complain about his luck. He hadn't even closed the lid of the\r\nbin. But perhaps the oil-stained waste he had drawn over himself had\r\ngiven them the idea that he was just more waste underneath.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the guards didn't give a damn whether they found him or not.\r\nIt was quite possible. On a low official level a cynical desire for\r\nself-comfort could dominate the thinking of a man.\r\n\r\nIt was quite possible that the guards who had been sent down to\r\nsearch for him--or one of the guards, at least--had been angry at his\r\nsuperiors. Just a quick look and to hell with it--that must have been\r\nhis attitude.\r\n\r\nIt made sense in another way. They wouldn't suspect the bin because the\r\nbin was so conspicuous and obvious a hiding place. The Purloined Letter\r\nsort of thing. Crawl into an empty coffin at a funeral and no one will\r\ngive you a second glance. All dead men look alike.\r\n\r\nThe Master Sequence Selector compartment was a coffin, too--a big,\r\nall-metal coffin arching above him and hemming him in. If he hoped to\r\nget out of it alive, he'd have to do more than just beat on the lid\r\nwith his fists.\r\n\r\nAlmost instantly he was ashamed of his thoughts. He had been extremely\r\nlucky so far. The funeral was over, the sod firmly in place. They would\r\nnot be likely to dig him up on suspicion, and he could stay buried\r\nuntil he starved to death.\r\n\r\nThe worst would be over when they found him. The thirst torment would\r\nbe the worst, but if it became unbearable he would still have the\r\nchoice of surrendering himself.\r\n\r\nQuite possibly he _would_ die of thirst. Quite possibly he could shout\r\nhis lungs out and still remain trapped. If a search had been made and\r\nthey had failed to find him, sullen anger might have tempted them\r\nto do an unthinkable thing. They might have locked the door of the\r\ncompartment so that the corpse would have no opportunity of escaping\r\nprematurely and making them look like fools.\r\n\r\nCorriston was just starting to climb out of the bin to investigate\r\nthe truth or falseness of that utterly demoralizing possibility when\r\nhe heard the sound. It was a very peculiar sound, three or four\r\ntimes repeated, and he heard it clearly above the low drone of the\r\nSelector's automatic controls.\r\n\r\nHe stood up in the bin, straining his ears. It came again, louder this\r\ntime. It was only a short distance away and it was a voice sound,\r\nunmistakably a voice sound.\r\n\r\nHe climbed out of the bin, grasped a metal rod that projected from\r\none of the cross-beams, and descended cautiously to the base of the\r\nSelector. The droning increased for an instant, rising to a whine so\r\nhigh-pitched that he could no longer hear the voice.\r\n\r\nHe started moving around the edge of the Selector, keeping well within\r\nits shadow, watching shafts of dull light move backwards and forwards\r\nacross the floor. He hardly expected anyone to leap out at him. The\r\nvoice had not seemed quite that near; in fact, he was by no means sure\r\nthat it had come from the compartment at all. But if not from the\r\ncompartment, where?\r\n\r\nHe found out quickly enough. There was a square, windowlike grate a few\r\nfeet from the Selector's automatic control panel, set high up on the\r\nwall. A faint, steady glow came from it.\r\n\r\nCorriston paused for an instant directly below the glow, measuring the\r\ndistance from the floor to the aperture with his eyes. He strained his\r\nears again, waiting for the whine to subside. It continued shrill, but\r\nsuddenly he heard the voice again, heard it above the whine.\r\n\r\nThere was stark terror in the voice. It was despairing and desperate\r\nin its pleading, and it seemed to Corriston that he would remember it\r\nuntil he died. He thought he recognized the voice, but he couldn't be\r\nsure.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps merciful that he couldn't, for the grate was at least\r\nten feet above the floor and had he known beyond the faintest shadow\r\nof doubt that it was Helen Ramsey's voice, his inability to reach her\r\nwould have been fiendish torment.\r\n\r\nHe hoped only one thing--that he had to reach that voice in time.\r\n\r\nFirst of all he had to stay calm. Even a calm man could not hope to\r\nscale a ten-foot wall with his bare hands, but an agitated man would\r\nhave no chance at all. Something to stand on! A box--anything!\r\n\r\nA box would help, a ladder would be better. But what were his chances\r\nof finding a ladder in the Selector compartment? Not good at all.\r\nStill, he could search for a ladder. Quickly now. No time to waste, but\r\ndon't lose your head. Take thirty seconds, a good long thirty seconds\r\nto look around for a metal ladder. There just might be one standing\r\nsomewhere against the wall.\r\n\r\nThere was! Not one ladder, but two, leaning against the wall directly\r\nopposite the glimmering front section of the Selector.\r\n\r\nIt was amazing how desperation could change a man. In the great moments\r\nof danger and desperation small, neurotic concerns ceased to matter.\r\n\r\nHe was sure now. He had recognized the voice beyond any possibility of\r\ndoubt. The ladder scraped against the wall and swayed a little, and for\r\nan instant he feared it might slide out from under him. He paused to\r\nmake sure, and then went swiftly on up until his head was level with\r\nthe grate.\r\n\r\nHe grasped the heavy grillwork with both hands and raised himself\r\nhigher. He could see clearly through the grill into the compartment\r\nbeyond now. The entire compartment was visible from where he stood. It\r\nwas small and square and dimly lighted by an overhead lamp, and there\r\nwas a paneled door leading into it.\r\n\r\nClose to the door a man was standing. Corriston couldn't see his face.\r\nHe was half-turned away from the wall opposite him, and the girl who\r\nwas struggling to escape from him was more than two-thirds concealed by\r\nhis massive shoulders.\r\n\r\nHe was holding her in a tight, merciless grip. He had locked one hand\r\non her wrist and was preventing her from moving either backwards or\r\nforwards. It was costing him no effort. He simply stood very straight\r\nand still while she struggled vainly to free herself.\r\n\r\nImmense strength seemed to emanate from him, complete assurance and\r\na coldly calculating kind of brutality which appeared to be slowly\r\nundermining her will to resist. Her struggles became less frantic\r\nsecond by slow second, and that she was about to stop struggling\r\naltogether was evident from the way her right arm had begun to dangle\r\nand her body to sag.\r\n\r\nThe man was holding her by the left wrist in a left-handed grip. He was\r\ncruelly twisting her wrist and suddenly she cried out again in pain and\r\ndespairing helplessness.\r\n\r\nThe blood started mounting to Corriston's temples. He began tugging at\r\nthe grate with both hands, exerting all his strength in a desperate\r\neffort to dislodge it. It began to move a little, to become less firmly\r\nattached to the wall. He could feel it moving under his hands, rasping\r\nand creaking as it loosened inch by inch.\r\n\r\nHe was covered with sweat. Already in his mind he had killed the man,\r\nand Helen Ramsey was tight in his arms, happy and alive.\r\n\r\nThe man did not seem to hear the rasp of the grate coming loose. He\r\nneither turned nor raised his head. His free hand had gone out and\r\nacross the girl's face. But if he had struck her on the face, she gave\r\nno sign. She did not recoil as if from a blow and there was something\r\nstrange about the movement. It was as if the man had reached out to\r\ntear something from the girl's face--a veil or a mask.\r\n\r\nHis hand whipped back empty but his fingers were oddly twisted, as if\r\nhe had clawed at something that had failed to come free.\r\n\r\nCorriston pulled back his shoulders and his posture on the ladder grew\r\nmore erect. He knew that his exertions might send the ladder toppling\r\nbut it was a risk he had to take.\r\n\r\nThe grate was freely movable now. He could move it backwards and\r\nforwards, six or eight inches each way; but he still could not rip it\r\ncompletely free.\r\n\r\nHe kept on tugging, his neck cords bulging, the ladder swaying\r\ndangerously. The grate could be moved upward now, just a little. No, it\r\nwas finally coming completely loose. He could move it in all directions\r\nand even push it outward at right angles to its base.\r\n\r\nTwice he heard Helen Ramsey cry out again, and her screams became a\r\ngoad that turned his wrists to steel. With a sudden, convulsive wrench\r\nhe twisted the grate sideways. It came loose in his hands. It was so\r\nsurprisingly light that an incongruous rage surged up in him. It was\r\ncruelly perverse, intolerable, that he should have been so long delayed\r\nby a thin sheet of metal that hardly seemed to have any weight at all.\r\n\r\nHe swung about on the ladder and let the grate drop. It struck the\r\nfloor a few feet from the Selector and rebounded with a clang loud\r\nenough to wake the dead. The ladder swayed again, and he had to grab\r\nthe edge of the aperture quickly and with both hands to keep himself\r\nfrom toppling.\r\n\r\nHe pulled himself forward through the aperture on his stomach, taking\r\ncare not to dislodge the ladder. His temples were pounding and his\r\npalms sticky with sweat. He did not look down until he was completely\r\nthrough, dreading what he might see.\r\n\r\nHe passed a hand over his eyes. It was unbelievable, but he had\r\nto believe it. The man was gone and the girl was now alone in the\r\ncompartment.\r\n\r\nHad the man fled in sudden fear, knowing that Corriston would be\r\nconsumed with a killing rage that would make him a more than dangerous\r\nadversary? Corriston didn't think so. The man had looked quite capable\r\nof putting up a furious struggle. More likely he had disappeared to\r\nkeep himself from being recognized, or because he had accomplished his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nBlind, embittered anger again boiled up in Corriston. Had the man\r\nwaited, he would have rejoiced and been less angry. He would have taken\r\na calm, deep breath and slowly set about the almost pleasant task of\r\nkilling him.\r\n\r\nHe felt cheated, outraged. Then his concern for Helen Ramsey made him\r\nforget his rage. Had she been felled with a blow, or had she simply\r\nfainted? He started down, then hesitated.\r\n\r\nThe ladder first. Before he descended it was necessary to make sure\r\nthat the ladder would be in the same compartment with him, set firmly\r\nagainst the wall, directly under the aperture. If he were prevented\r\nfrom leaving the compartment by the corridor door, he might find\r\nhimself needing the ladder. Without it he might be descending into a\r\ntrap that could close with a clang and abruptly imprison him.\r\n\r\nGetting down into the compartment was the worst part, just putting the\r\nladder into place and not knowing how badly hurt she was.\r\n\r\n_What if she's dead?_ he thought. _What if he killed her with a single\r\nblow? He looked strong enough. He could have killed her. God, don't let\r\nme think of that. I mustn't think it._\r\n\r\nHis feet touched the floor. He let out his breath slowly, turned and\r\ncrossed the floor to where she was lying. He went down on his knees and\r\nlifted her into his arms. She lay relaxed in his arms, face up, quiet,\r\nher lips slightly parted.\r\n\r\nHe looked down into her face, and for a moment his mind went numb,\r\nbecame still, so that there was no longer a whirling inside his\r\nhead--only a chilling horror.\r\n\r\nShe seemed to have two faces. One was shrunken and almost torn away,\r\na shredded fragment of a face. But enough of it remained for him to\r\nsee the shriveled flesh of the cheeks, the puckered mouth, the white\r\nhair clinging to the temples. It was the face of an old woman but so\r\nfragmentary that it could not even have been called a half-face. And\r\neven though it had been almost ripped away, it seemed still to adhere\r\nfirmly to the face to which it had been attached, and to blend with it,\r\nso that the features of both faces intermingled in a quite unnatural\r\nway.\r\n\r\nNot quite, though; Helen Ramsey's face was sharper, more distinct--all\r\nof the features stood out more clearly. And when Corriston's stunned\r\nmind began to function normally again, he realized that the old woman's\r\nface was--had to be--a plastic mask.\r\n\r\nIt took him only an instant to remove the ghastly thing from features\r\nwhich he could not bear to see defaced.\r\n\r\nHe had to pry it loose, but he did so very gently, exactly as a\r\nsculptor might have pried loose a life mask from the face of a\r\nrecumbent model.\r\n\r\nHe held it in his hand and looked at it, and a little of the horror\r\ncrept back into his mind.\r\n\r\nIt was the merest fragment, as he had thought. Thin, flexible, a\r\ntissue-structure of incomplete, aged features, and with an inner\r\nsurface that was very rough and uneven, as if something had been torn\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nHe could have crumpled it up in his hand, but he did not do so. With\r\na lack of foresight which he was later to regret--a lack which was to\r\nprove tragic--he simply flung it from him, as though its ugliness had\r\nunnerved him so that he could no longer endure the sight of it.\r\n\r\nHelen Ramsey was a dead weight in his arms, and for a moment he feared\r\nthat she had stopped breathing. So great was his fear, so paralyzing,\r\nthat his hand on her pulse became rigid, and for a moment he could\r\nneither move nor think.\r\n\r\nThen he felt the slow beat of her pulse and a great thankfulness came\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nHe knew then that he must get help as quickly as possible. He eased her\r\ngently to the floor, walked to the door and locked it securely. Then\r\nhe returned to her and took her into his arms again. He spent several\r\nminutes trying to revive her. But when she did not open her eyes, did\r\nnot even stir in his arms, he knew that he could not wait any longer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8\r\n\r\n\r\nAn inexorable kind of determination enabled Corriston to get to the\r\nStation's central control compartment, and confront the commander,\r\nwhen the latter, absorbed by matters of the utmost urgency, had\r\ntriple-guarded his privacy by stationing executive officers outside the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nCommander Clement was a small man physically, with a strangely bland,\r\nalmost cherubic face. But his face was dark with anger now--or possibly\r\nit was shock that he was experiencing--and the heightened color seemed\r\nto add to his dignity, making him look not merely forcibly determined,\r\nbut almost formidable. His white uniform and the seven gold bars on\r\neach epaulet helped a good deal too. It was impossible to determine at\r\na glance just how great was his inner strength, but Corriston knew that\r\nhe could not have gotten where he was had he not possessed unalloyed\r\nresoluteness.\r\n\r\nHe was standing by a visual reference mechanism which looked almost\r\nexactly like a black stovepipe spiraling up from the deck. There was\r\na speaking tube in his hand, and he was talking into it. He seemed\r\ncompletely unaware that he was no longer alone.\r\n\r\nHad Corriston been less agitated he would have felt a little sorry for\r\nthe officer who had admitted him. The officer had been so impressed by\r\nCorriston's gravity and the earnestness with which he had pleaded his\r\ncase that he had stepped forward and opened the door without question,\r\nassuming, no doubt, that Clement would look up instantly and see\r\nCorriston standing just inside the doorway.\r\n\r\nNow the door had closed again, Clement hadn't looked up, and the\r\nofficer was going to be in trouble. But Corriston had no time and very\r\nlittle inclination to worry about that. What Commander Clement was\r\nsaying into the speaking tube had a far stronger claim on his attention.\r\n\r\n\"It's the worst thing that could have happened,\" Clement was saying.\r\n\"We can't just brazen it out. It's going to mean trouble, serious\r\ntrouble. What's that? How should I know what happened? When you're\r\ncarrying a certain kind of cargo a thousand things can go wrong. The\r\nship went out of control, that's all. The first radio message didn't\r\ntell me anything. The captain was trying to cover up to save himself.\r\nHe didn't even want _me_ to know.\r\n\r\n\"You bet it can happen again. We've got to be prepared for that, too.\r\nBut right now--\"\r\n\r\nCommander Clement saw Corriston then. His expression didn't change, but\r\nit seemed to Corriston that he paled slightly.\r\n\r\n\"That's all for now,\" he said, and returned the speaking tube to its\r\ncradle.\r\n\r\nHe looked steadily at Corriston for a moment. A glint of anger appeared\r\nin his eyes, and suddenly they were blazing.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by coming in here unannounced, Lieutenant?\" he\r\ndemanded. \"I gave strict orders that no one was to be admitted. If I\r\ndidn't know you were suffering from severe space-shock....\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, sir,\" Corriston said quickly. \"It's very urgent. I think\r\nI can convince you that I am _not_ suffering from space-shock. I've\r\nfound Miss Ramsey. She's been badly hurt and needs immediate medical\r\nattention.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commander looked as if a man he had thought sane was standing\r\nbefore him with a gun in his hand. Not Corriston, but some other, more\r\nviolent man. For a moment longer he remained rigid and then his hand\r\nwent out and tightened on Corriston's arm.\r\n\r\n\"By heaven, if you're lying to me!\"\r\n\r\n\"I would have no reason to lie, sir. It proves I'm not a space-shock\r\ncase. But that's unimportant now. She's safe for the moment. No one can\r\nget to her. I bolted the door on the inside. Unless--\"\r\n\r\nCorriston went pale. \"No, there's no danger. I drew the ladder up and\r\nreturned it to the Selector compartment. Then I threw the lock on the\r\nemergency door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Start at the beginning,\" Clement said. \"If she's in danger well get to\r\nher. Take it easy now, and tell me exactly what happened.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston went over it fast. He said nothing about the mask. Let\r\nClement find that out for himself.\r\n\r\nCommander Clement walked to the door, threw it open and spoke to the\r\nexecutive officer who was stationed outside. The officer came into the\r\ncontrol room.\r\n\r\n\"Stay with Lieutenant Corriston until I get back,\" Clement said. \"He's\r\nnot to leave. He understands that.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned back to Corriston. \"I'm afraid you'll have to consider\r\nyourself still under guard, Lieutenant. I have only your word that you\r\nfound Miss Ramsey. I believe you, but there are some regulations even I\r\ncan't waive.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right,\" Corriston said. \"I won't attempt to leave. But please\r\nhurry, sir.\"\r\n\r\nCommander Clement hesitated, then said with a smile: \"I knew about the\r\nguard you knocked out, Lieutenant. You're a very hot-headed young man.\r\nThat's _really_ a court-martial offense, but perhaps we can smooth it\r\nover if you're telling the truth now. You were in the position of a man\r\nimprisoned for a crime he didn't commit. If he can prove his innocence,\r\nthe law is very lenient. He can escape and still get a full pardon,\r\neven a pardon with apologies. It's a different matter, of course if he\r\n_kills_ a guard to escape. You didn't.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston was tempted to say, \"I think perhaps I tried to, sir,\" but\r\nthought better of it. He'd ask Clement later why the guards who had\r\nbeen sent down into the Selector compartment had failed to find him.\r\nIt wasn't important enough now to waste a second thought on, but just\r\nout of curiosity he would ask.\r\n\r\nHe didn't have to. After Clement had departed the executive officer\r\ntold him. \"They made a pretty thorough search for you,\" he said. \"Or so\r\nthey claimed. But they had been drinking heavily--every one of them.\r\nMaintaining discipline can be a terrible headache at times. There's a\r\nlot of objectivity about the commander and he doesn't try to crack down\r\ntoo hard. He knows what it means to be out here for months with nothing\r\nto break the monotony. Hell, if we could send for our wives more often\r\nit wouldn't be so bad.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston's palms were cold. He stood very still, wondering how long it\r\nwould take the commander to return with the news he wanted to hear.\r\n\r\n\"The question is whether life is really worth living without a woman to\r\ntalk to,\" the executive officer went on. \"Just to lie relaxed and watch\r\na pretty girl move slowly around a room. It does something for you.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston wished the man would keep quiet. Under ordinary circumstances\r\nhe could have sympathized heartily. He couldn't now. There was only one\r\ngirl he wanted to see walk around a room, and she might just as well\r\nhave been at the opposite end of space.\r\n\r\nShe wasn't walking around a room now. She was lying helplessly sprawled\r\nout, waiting for rescue to come. It had to come soon, it had to. The\r\ncommander wouldn't just go down alone after her. He'd be accompanied by\r\na half-dozen executive officers who would know exactly how to bundle\r\nher into a stretcher and carry her to the sick bay.\r\n\r\nBut what if a killer just happened to be crouching in one of the\r\ncorridors, waiting for the stretcher to pass? A killer with a poisoned\r\nbarb....\r\n\r\nCorriston couldn't stand still. He walked back and forth across the\r\ncontrol room while the executive officer continued to talk. He paid no\r\nheed at all.\r\n\r\nCorriston heard a footfall as he paced. He turned and saw that\r\nCommander Clement had returned. He was standing in the doorway with a\r\nstrange look on his face.\r\n\r\nCorriston felt bewildered, unable to quite believe that Clement was\r\nreally back. It was like a dream that had suddenly turned real, a\r\nlooking glass reversal with a strange quality of distortion about it.\r\n\r\nIt was real enough. Clement entered and shut the door behind him, very\r\nfirmly and carefully, as if he wanted to make sure that Corriston would\r\nnot attempt to escape.\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly forward, looking at the executive officer as if\r\nCorriston had no place at all in his thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"Everything he told me was a lie,\" Clement said. \"Everything. There\r\nwas no girl. The compartment was locked; so was the emergency door\r\nleading down to the Selector. The ladder was standing against the wall\r\nin the Selector compartment. Miss Ramsey could not have been in the\r\ncompartment--not at any time. There was nothing to indicate it. She\r\njust wasn't there.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston moved toward him, his face white. \"That's a lie and you know\r\nit. What have you done with her? You'd better tell me. You can have me\r\ncourt-martialed, but you can't stop me from talking. I can prove she\r\nwas there. The grate--\"\r\n\r\n\"The grate? What are you talking about? There was no ripped-out grate.\r\nThe grate was in place. I feel very sorry for you, Lieutenant. But I\r\ncan't let sympathy stand in the way of my duty. In some respects you're\r\nvery rational. You can think logically and clearly ... up to a point.\r\nBut the shock weakness is there. It's very serious when you start\r\nhaving actual hallucinations.\"\r\n\r\nThe executive officer had drawn his gun. He was holding it rather\r\nloosely in his hand now, triggered and ready for any dangerous or\r\nsuspicious move on Corriston's part.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in Clement's gaze as he swung about to refute the\r\ndark mistrust that had come into the executive officer's eyes. He\r\nseemed intent only on bolstering that mistrust by driving even deeper\r\nnails into Corriston's coffin.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid we'll have to continue to regard Lieutenant Corriston as\r\ndangerously unstable,\" he said. \"Keep your gun on him when you take him\r\nback to the Ward. Don't relax your vigilance for an instant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I won't,\" the executive officer promised.\r\n\r\n\"Good. You're not going to make any further trouble for us, are you,\r\nLieutenant?\"\r\n\r\nThe question seemed to call for no answer and Corriston made none. He\r\nturned slowly and walked toward the door, despairingly aware that a man\r\nhe had rather liked had fallen into step behind him and would shoot him\r\ndead if he so much as wavered.\r\n\r\nJust as he reached the door Clement spoke again, giving the executive\r\nofficer final instructions. \"He must not be permitted to leave his\r\ncell. Make sure of that, Simms. Post a permanent guard at the door. He\r\nmust be kept under constant surveillance. If he's the self-destructive\r\ntype, and I'm by no means sure he isn't, he may attempt to kill\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9\r\n\r\n\r\n_May attempt to kill himself. May attempt.... May attempt.... May\r\nattempt to kill himself._ Corriston sat up on his cot, his mouth dry,\r\nhis temples pounding.\r\n\r\nHad Clement implanted the suggestion in his mind deliberately, with\r\ninfinite cruelty and cunning? Was Clement really hoping that he _would_\r\ncommit suicide? If he took his own life Clement would stand to gain a\r\ngreat deal.\r\n\r\nBut could Clement be that much of a scoundrel? Was he, in fact, a\r\nscoundrel at all?\r\n\r\nCorriston knew that he could not afford to succumb to panic. Only by\r\nstaying calm, by trying to reason it out logically, could he hope to\r\nget anywhere. Not at the truth, perhaps, but anywhere at all.\r\n\r\nStart off with a supposition: The commander was everything that he\r\npretended to be, an honest man with immense responsibilities which he\r\ncould not delegate to anyone else. A forthright, hot-tempered, but\r\ncompletely sincere man. A little secretive, yes, but only because he\r\ntook his responsibilities so seriously.\r\n\r\nStart off by assuming that Clement was that kind of a man. What\r\nwould he stand to gain if Corriston killed himself? The removal of\r\none responsibility, at the very least. It was bad for morale if an\r\nofficer had hallucinations that vitally concerned the Station itself.\r\nBut a hallucination about the wealthiest girl on Earth wasn't just\r\nrun-of-the-mill. It could not only disturb every officer and enlisted\r\nman on the Station; it could have political repercussions on Earth.\r\n\r\nClement was already in trouble because of the freighter. The chances\r\nwere a Congressional Investigating Committee would be coming out.\r\nThey'd be sure to hear about Corriston. His story would be all over the\r\nStation, on everyone's lips.\r\n\r\nIf Corriston took his own life the commander would be spared all that.\r\nHe'd have nothing to answer for. The entire affair could be hushed up.\r\nOr could it?\r\n\r\nWait a minute, better give the whole problem another twirl. Even if\r\nthe Commander was a completely honest man, he wouldn't stand to gain\r\ntoo much. He might even find himself in more serious trouble. And look\r\nat it in another way: It was hard to believe that a hallucination\r\nconcerning Helen Ramsey could be much more than a gadfly irritation.\r\nIf the full truth came out, Clement could clear himself of all blame.\r\nWould a man of integrity suggest that a fellow-officer take his own\r\nlife solely to remove a gadfly irritation? Or _any_ irritation, for\r\nthat matter?\r\n\r\nIt was inconceivable on the face of it. The first supposition was a\r\ncontradiction in terms. It did not remain valid under close scrutiny\r\nand therefore it had to be rejected.\r\n\r\nSupposition number two: Clement was in all respects the exact opposite\r\nof an honest man. Clement had something dark and damaging to conceal,\r\nwas in more serious trouble than he'd allowed anyone to suspect.\r\nClement had some reason for not wanting the truth about Ramsey's\r\ndaughter to come out.\r\n\r\nWhat would he stand to gain if Corriston took himself out of the world?\r\nUnfortunately there were wide areas where any kind of speculation had\r\nto penetrate an almost absolute vacuum to get anywhere at all.\r\n\r\nThe situation on Mars? Was there some as yet undemonstratable link\r\nbetween Ramsey's uranium holdings and the Station itself? Was Clement\r\ninvolved with Ramsey in some way? And was Ramsey's daughter a vital\r\nlink in the chain?\r\n\r\nHad the accident to the freighter put an additional strain on the\r\nchain, a strain so great that Clement had been forced to take\r\nimmediate, drastic action to protect himself?\r\n\r\nCorriston tried to remember exactly what the Commander had said over\r\nthe speaking tube. He had tried to listen intently, but he had been\r\ntoo agitated to make much sense out of the few brief sentences which\r\nhe had overheard. Clement had been speaking in anger and not too\r\ncoherently, and it had been a one-way conversation, with the replying\r\nvoice completely silent, or, at the very least, inaudible. But one\r\nthing about the conversation _had_ made a strong impression on him.\r\nClement had not sounded like an honest man with nothing to conceal. On\r\nthe contrary, he had sounded like a worried and guilty man.\r\n\r\nCorriston shut his eyes and relaxed for a moment on his cot. It was\r\nan uneasy, tormenting kind of relaxation, because another thought had\r\noccurred to him.\r\n\r\nWhat if Clement had not deliberately tried to plant a suicide\r\nsuggestion in his mind at all? What if he had simply spoken with the\r\nmalice of a not too kindly man appalled and enraged by a space-shock\r\nvictim who had not only lied to him, but had given every evidence of\r\nbeing dangerously difficult to control.\r\n\r\nIt certainly made sense. There was nothing in the cell which might have\r\nenabled Corriston to take his own life, even had he been so inclined.\r\nWould not Clement have taken care to introduce into the cell some\r\nconvenient, readily available weapon--a steel file, perhaps or even a\r\nsmall spool of wire?\r\n\r\nA cold dream had begun to take possession of Corriston. Was it true\r\nthen, could it possibly be true? Was he hallucinating? He had seen\r\nHelen Ramsey go into a ladies' lounge and disappear. He had seen her\r\na second time, and she had worn a mask. The mask was so strange that\r\nit would have made four men out of five question their own sanity. But\r\nhe had knelt beside her and lifted her into his arms. He had felt the\r\npulse at her wrist. Well? If after that she had disappeared again, was\r\nit not more of a black mark against him than if he had failed to touch\r\nher at all?\r\n\r\nAll hallucinations seem real to the insane. The realer they seem the\r\nmore likely they are to be inescapably damning.\r\n\r\nCould a warped mind hope to escape from such a dilemma? Was there any\r\npossible way of making sure? No, not if he had actually cracked up. But\r\nsupposing he hadn't. Suppose he had just passed for an instant over the\r\nborderline, as a result of strain, of abnormal circumstances, and was\r\nnow completely rational again. In that case, proof would help. Proof\r\ncould convince him that at least a part of what had happened had been\r\nreal, that he had not been hallucinating continuously for days.\r\n\r\nIf he could prove conclusively that he had not been hallucinating when\r\nhe had climbed through the grate, Helen Ramsey's presence beyond the\r\ngrate would be pretty well established. Even an insane man does not\r\nabandon all logic when he performs a complicated act. He is not likely\r\nto ascend a ten foot wall and climb through a grate in pursuit of a\r\ncomplete illusion.\r\n\r\nOh, it _could_ happen.... Possibly it had happened many times in\r\nhospitals for the incurably insane. But somehow he could not believe\r\nthat it had happened in his case. Right at this moment he was certainly\r\nnot in an abnormal state of mind. How could he be when he was able to\r\nthink so logically and consistently?\r\n\r\nBeing sane now, or at least having the firm conviction that he was\r\nsane, would enable him to retrace what had happened step by step. What\r\nhe were to retrace it in reality ... until he came to the grate? If\r\nthe grate had been ripped out, the torment and uncertainty in his mind\r\nwould vanish. He would be free then to move against Clement, to unmask\r\nand expose him for the scoundrel he was.\r\n\r\nFree? The very thought was a mockery. He was free for twenty feet in\r\neither direction, free to shout and summon the guard. But beyond\r\nthat....\r\n\r\nCorriston sat up straight. Free to summon the guard. Free to summon a\r\nman he had dropped to the floor with two quick, decisive and totally\r\nunexpected blows. But if he did summon the guard, what then? Could\r\nhe be doubled up with cramps--the old prisoners' dodge? \"Get me to a\r\ndoctor. I think I'm dying.\"\r\n\r\nHell no, not that. It was mildewed even on the face of it. The guard\r\nwouldn't be that much of a fool. He'd whip out a gun, and slash\r\ndownward with it at the first suspicious move on the part of a man he\r\nhated.\r\n\r\nWas there any other way? Perhaps there was ... a quite simple way. Why\r\ncouldn't he simply ask the guard to step into the cell and request\r\npermission to talk to him? He would plead urgency, but do it very\r\ncasually, arouse the man's curiosity without antagonizing him too\r\nmuch. No need to be crafty, await some unlikely opportunity, or\r\nanything of the sort.\r\n\r\nSimply overpower the man--straight off, without any fuss.\r\n\r\nIt had happened before, but that very fact would make the guard\r\ncontemptuous, more than ever convinced that the first time he hadn't\r\nreally been taken by surprise at all. His pride would make him want\r\nto believe that. He was the kind of man who could rationalize a\r\nhumiliating defeat and blot it completely from his memory.\r\n\r\nIt not only worked, it worked better than he could have dared hope.\r\nWhen he spoke a few words through the door, the guard became instantly\r\ncurious. He unlocked the cell and came in, his eyes narrowed in\r\nanger ... anger, but not suspicion. His gun remained on his hip as he\r\nwalked up to Corriston and stood directly facing him, well within\r\ngrappling range.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you want to talk to me about?\" he demanded. \"Better make\r\nit brief. I'm not supposed to talk to you at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear that,\" Corriston said. \"You've got no idea how\r\ndepressing it is to be locked up in a narrow cell with absolutely no\r\none to talk to.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't like it, eh? Well, you brought it on yourself.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston caught the man about the waist and brought his right fist\r\ndown three times on his curving back. Each blow was a powerful one,\r\nslanting downward toward the kidney.\r\n\r\nThen Corriston hit the guard directly in the small of the back, with\r\nan even more punishing blow. The cumulative effect was instantaneous.\r\nThe guard collapsed and sank down like a suddenly deflated balloon, the\r\nbreath whistling from between his teeth.\r\n\r\nCorriston watched him sink to the floor and straighten out. Forewarned\r\nas he was, he was still appalled by the almost instant, shocking change\r\nin the man's expression. For the second time the guard's features began\r\nto come apart. The entire upper portion of his face seemed to sink\r\ninward and broaden out, and the flowing began, the incredible refusal\r\nof his forehead and nose to remain in close proximity to his mouth.\r\n\r\nOne eye closed completely; the other remained open in a wide and almost\r\npupilless stare. The chin receded and the lips became a puckered gray\r\norifice that looked like some monstrous fungus growth sprouting from\r\nthe middle of a gargoyle face. The individual features became paler and\r\npaler as they spread, and suddenly there seemed to be no color left in\r\nthe face at all. It had turned completely waxen.\r\n\r\nIt was a horrifying thing to watch.\r\n\r\nCorriston knelt, opened the man's shirt and stared intently at the\r\nexposed throat, something he had not done the first time in the\r\ncafeteria. The first time he had simply knelt and searched under the\r\nshirt with his hand for a heartbeat which had surprised him by its\r\nsteadiness. He was quite sure now that the heart was beating firmly and\r\nsteadily.\r\n\r\nEven the peculiar appearance of the throat did not alarm him. But it\r\nmost certainly did interest him. Far down on the Security Guard's\r\nthroat, just above his breastbone, were a row of small hooks partly\r\nembedded in his flesh. The hooks were very tiny indeed, and their\r\nbrightness was obscured by a thin film of sweat. Corriston removed the\r\nmoisture with a quick flick of his thumb and continued to stare, as if\r\nhe could not quite believe his eyes.\r\n\r\nFinally he wedged his fingers under the base of the mask, and ripped it\r\nfrom the guard's face.\r\n\r\nUnder the mask, the face had a perfectly natural look. The features\r\nwere relaxed and vacuous, but there was no flowing, no unnatural\r\ndistortion at all. And it was quite a different face--the face of a\r\nman who had worn a disguise and was now so completely a stranger to\r\nCorriston that he might just as well have been any one of the Station's\r\nthirty-seven Security Guards.\r\n\r\nCorriston could see where the hook attachments had gone into the\r\nflesh in at least thirty places on the man's face: on his brow, his\r\ncheekbones, on both sides of his face clear down to the base of his\r\nneck. The tiny punctures made by the hooks were faintly rimmed with\r\nblood, perhaps because Corriston had torn the mask away too abruptly.\r\nUndoubtedly the skin had been anaesthetized, the hooks inserted\r\nskillfully by someone familiar with just what should be done to prevent\r\nscarring.\r\n\r\nHe hoped that the guard would not carry tiny scars on his face for the\r\nrest of his natural life. He arose and examined the mask. He had a\r\ncomplete false face.\r\n\r\nThe thing was ingenious beyond belief. It was no mere Halloween\r\nassemblage of papier-machÃ© flimflammery, but an elaborate and flexible\r\nmask of very thin plastic, or possibly metal. A prosthetic mask--if one\r\ncould use that term in connection with a mask. It was certainly more\r\ncomplex in structure than any prosthetic leg or arm he had ever seen on\r\na handicapped man, or would ever be likely to see.\r\n\r\nHe had a pretty good idea as to how it worked. A general idea.\r\nApparently when the hooks were attached to the muscular structure of\r\nthe human face underneath, every aspect of the wearer's face would be\r\ninstantly controlled and altered to conform to the configuration of\r\nthe false face. In that sense the mask could be said to actually mold\r\nitself to the wearer's face and transform it into a completely new and\r\ndifferent face.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, in some subtle way, the emotions felt by the owner of the\r\nreal face would be conveyed to the mask, so that it would express with\r\ndifferent features very much the same kinds of emotion.\r\n\r\nIngenious was scarcely the word for it. It was a miracle of\r\ntechnological science, almost beyond belief. But he could not doubt\r\nthe reality of what he saw, for he held the evidence in his hand. No\r\nhallucination could possibly be _that_ real.\r\n\r\nThe way the mask's surface coloration could change when the wearer's\r\nemotions changed was perhaps the most amazing miracle of all. He had\r\nseen the guard's color come and go, had watched him redden with anger\r\nand then grow pale.\r\n\r\nIt could only mean that there was some mechanically symbiotic,\r\nemotion-sensitive electronic coating or skin surface, or series of\r\ntubes on the inner surface of the mask, which could simulate actual\r\nblood flow much like a network of tiny heat regulators. This network\r\nwould be so responsive to the slightest change in body temperature\r\nthat the mask would alter its color the instant the wearer experienced\r\nfright or grew uncontrollably angry. What made it seem logical and\r\neven likely was the fact that caloric changes do occur in just such a\r\nfashion in the human body with every shift from anger to grief or from\r\npain to shock.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing simple about the inner surface of the mask. It was a\r\nmaze of complicated gadgetry concentrated in less than eight inches of\r\nspace, perhaps thirty or forty separate mechanisms in all, some as tiny\r\nas the head of a pin, and others about one inch in width.\r\n\r\nWhen the wearer became unconscious, the mask seemingly lost its\r\nintegrity. The gadgets either stopped functioning or ceased to function\r\nproperly and the false face became a dissolving, hideous caricature;\r\nthat bore little or no resemblance to the human countenance in repose,\r\nor even to the human countenance convulsed with sudden shock.\r\n\r\nHow incredibly blind he had been in failing to suspect the existence\r\nof a mask when the guard's face had grown unnatural and ghastly in the\r\ncafeteria. He had taken it for granted that it was the man himself who\r\nhad changed.\r\n\r\nFortunately he was spared now from making the same mistake twice, and\r\nhe took full advantage of the fact. He knelt again and began the by no\r\nmeans easy task of removing the uniform. He had to lift him up and turn\r\nhim over twice and each time the man groaned and stirred a little. He\r\nseemed on the verge of coming to, but Corriston shut his mind to the\r\npossibility until the last of the man's garments had been tossed in a\r\npile on the floor.\r\n\r\nHe quickly took off his own uniform then, and carefully and\r\nmethodically arrayed himself as a guard, taking care to leave the coat\r\nunbuttoned at the throat and even going so far as to draw on the heavy\r\nwoolen socks and attach to his wrist the guard's metal identification\r\ndisk.\r\n\r\nAn audacious thought occurred to him, but he dismissed it at once. He\r\ncould not attach the mask to his own face. It would have required the\r\nadministrations of an expert, or, at the very least, someone familiar\r\nwith the thing who knew exactly how it was supposed to be hooked into\r\nplace. He had no way of knowing and he recoiled instinctively from the\r\nthought of hooks, however tiny, marring the skin on his face.\r\n\r\nNo, he'd have to get along without the mask. No one on the lower levels\r\nknew him by sight, with the one ugly exception of a killer he'd never\r\nseen clearly enough to recognize in return. And in the guard's uniform\r\nhe might even succeed in deceiving the killer if he moved quickly\r\nenough to give the man only a brief glimpse of him as he crossed the\r\nwide-view promenade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10\r\n\r\n\r\nCorriston stared down at the still unconscious guard, lying stretched\r\nout unclothed on the floor of the cell, then he turned, patting the\r\nguard's gun which now nestled in its transferred holster on his\r\nangular, bony hip.\r\n\r\nWell, there were perhaps even worse ways of ending up, and it was\r\ncertainly a destiny almost universally shared.\r\n\r\nHe walked out through the open door of the cell without a backward\r\nglance.\r\n\r\nHe had changed his plans completely now. The complicated structure of\r\nthe mask between his hands had so completely reassured him as to his\r\ncomplete sanity, that he was no longer under a compulsion to return to\r\nthe Selector Compartment for additional proof.\r\n\r\nAll of the pieces were coming together and melting into a pattern that\r\nremained obscure only because there was still so much about it that he\r\ndid not understand. He knew there was a killer loose on the Station,\r\nthe same one who had been loose on the ship that had taken him to the\r\nStation. He knew about a poisoned barb that had killed one man and had\r\nbarely missed killing Corriston himself.\r\n\r\nDismiss the killer for the moment. There was Helen Ramsey, the\r\nwealthiest girl on Earth. Think about Ramsey himself and what his\r\nwealth had done to Mars. Think about the colonists on Mars, men who\r\nhad endured unimaginable hardships and privation to stake out uranium\r\nclaims which Ramsey did not want them to have. Think about the\r\nfreighter that had gone out of control.\r\n\r\nThink about Clement. Think very _hard_ about Clement. The tragedy had\r\nshaken him, had given him the look of a very guilty man. He had not\r\nwanted it to happen. He had been alarmed, appalled. Yes, think about\r\nClement--that very secretive man.\r\n\r\nThe killer? You can't get rid of him, can you? He keeps coming back\r\ninto your mind. The killer had not tried to spare Helen Ramsey. He had\r\nkilled her bodyguard and ripped a mask from her face. No attempt at\r\nprotection there. But Clement could not have known about that. He had\r\nevidently been searching for Helen Ramsey himself. The news that she\r\nhad been found had startled him, had given him a visible jolt.\r\n\r\nCorriston did not think that the pattern would dissolve. A few of its\r\nfeatures were becoming too clear now, the implications too inescapable.\r\nThere was something going on that was ugly at the core of it, and the\r\ncoming of the killer had simply brought it out into the open. Not too\r\nmuch into the open as yet perhaps, but the handwriting on the wall had\r\nat least become almost readable. Perhaps the accident to the freighter\r\nhad also helped to bring it into the open. In some obscure way\r\neverything seemed to dovetail: Ramsey; the situation on Mars; Clement\r\nand the freighter; a twice disappearing Helen Ramsey; and an accusation\r\nof space-shock which was completely false and unjustified. Each seemed\r\nto hover just above the center of a very definite pattern.\r\n\r\nAnd so did the masks! The masks in particular. Think, think hard about\r\nthe masks and what the very existence of such masks on the Station\r\nimplied.\r\n\r\nThe masks could only have been designed to cover the darkest deceit, to\r\ncover the most terrifying treachery.\r\n\r\nHow many officers and enlisted men on the Station were wearing masks?\r\nHow many? And why? Was _every_ officer on the Station wearing one? If\r\nthe masks were thought necessary, if their employment had been made\r\nmandatory, there could be only one explanation.\r\n\r\nEvery officer and every enlisted man was masquerading. The Station was\r\nofficered and manned by--a word he'd never liked from a dictionary of\r\nobsolete American slang came unbidden into his mind--_Phonies!_\r\n\r\nThe thought staggered him. For a moment he rejected it as\r\ninconceivable, outside the bounds of reason. But it remained on the\r\nperimeter of his consciousness and would not be dislodged. It came back\r\nand set itself down where its dominance over his mind could not be\r\ncontested.\r\n\r\nWhat else _could_ it mean? Masks have only one purpose: to enable the\r\nwearer to avoid being recognized.\r\n\r\nQuite obviously the phony officers could be wearing masks for only\r\none reason: to conceal their real identities while they manned the\r\nStations, carrying on the tasks of the men they had displaced.\r\n\r\nCarrying on the tasks of the rightful officers, but with a difference.\r\nAnd that difference would almost certainly be criminal activity on a\r\nwide and daring scale.\r\n\r\nThe only question remaining to be answered was how high did that\r\nactivity ascend? Did it ascend to the very top, to Commander Clement\r\nhimself?\r\n\r\nFortunately, the violence of space is a controlled violence, and\r\ndetermined men can slip through it with tools and building materials.\r\nThey can base themselves on zero-gravity construction rafts and take\r\nrefuge in pressurized crevices, go floating along steel girders five\r\nhundred feet in length until there has been assembled the greatest\r\nof all miracles--a manned Space Station a thousand feet in diameter\r\nencircling Earth at a distance of fifteen hundred miles.\r\n\r\nThe Station had not been built in space, it had been built on Earth\r\nsection by section. However, the final task of putting it together had\r\nbeen left to the floating men in their fishbowl helmets, the suicide\r\nbrigade with their incredible vacuum equipment and remote control\r\nwelding arms.\r\n\r\nFifty-seven sections had been built on Earth over a period of five\r\nyears, thirty-four in the Eastern United States, the rest in scattered\r\nlocalities from Chicago to the Gold Coast. They had all been sent up\r\nby step rockets into the same narrow orbit around Earth. They were\r\nfifty-seven sections \"crash landing\" in a total vacuum, weightless and\r\nyet with sufficient mass and inertia to keep them in close proximity\r\nuntil the great task could get under way.\r\n\r\nThe assembled Station was cone-shaped, and it had been a colossal\r\nundertaking to keep it from developing stress defects over a third of\r\nits bulk during the early constructional stages. Under the guidance of\r\nexperts, the problem had been solved, but at a tragic price.\r\n\r\nAssembling the Station had cost the lives of fifty-three men, for\r\nthere is no easy way to bring together, join, seal and make safe\r\ntons of metal and plastic, intricate machinery and equipment, plus a\r\nthousand-and-one small, incidental contrivances fifteen hundred miles\r\nabove the emergency-alert systems and hospital facilities of Earth.\r\n\r\nSome of the men who had lost their lives had been blown out of\r\ntransport rocket tubes by mistake. Some had missed their footing too\r\nclose to a welding operation that had been halted too late. Some had\r\nfloated into capsules full of nitric oxygen gas under high pressure\r\nand had failed to veer away in time. Still others had tugged too\r\nstrenuously at heavy girders and the slow, but crushing inertia of an\r\nenormous, backward-swinging beam in free fall had ripped their space\r\nsuits asunder and fractured their spines.\r\n\r\nThere were five thousand ways of dying in space. But the sacrifice, the\r\nterror, the tragic toll seemed immeasurably remote now, for the roar of\r\nthe incoming and outgoing ships made the Station a gigantic reality so\r\ncompletely in the present that it seemed to have no past.\r\n\r\nSpinning always on its axis, substituting centrifugal force for\r\nthe gravity tug of Earth, the Station was a complete world, a\r\nself-contained macrocosm so immense that the magnetic-shod mechanics\r\nwho inspected it in relays, the passenger-carrying shuttle rockets from\r\nEarth that came and went, and even the thousand-foot ships that berthed\r\nfor re-fueling and clearance seemed hardly to encroach at all on its\r\nvast central bulk.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, it was something quite apart from the Station's bigness which\r\ncame under worldwide scrutiny when the freighter crashed and was\r\nsplintered into fragments, channeling a fiery crater in the earth and\r\ncausing the most disastrous accidental death toll in United States\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe news was flashed to the four corners of the earth, and almost\r\nsimultaneously a flight of United States military jets took off from\r\nthe Lake Superior airport to explore the wreckage.\r\n\r\nThe first message from the flight commander, Lieutenant Colonel\r\nHackett, came five hours later. It was tense, grim and it minced no\r\nwords. \"Wreckage radioactive. Main cargo uranium in a rough ore state.\r\nExplosion and subsequent intense radioactivity apparently caused by an\r\nauxiliary cargo of highly unstable uranium isotopes. If the freighter\r\nhad berthed at the Station the dangerous character of its cargo could\r\nnot have escaped detection. We have every reason to believe that it\r\n_intended_ to berth at the Station. Its signals to the Station, before\r\nsome undeterminable shipboard accident sent it out of control, confirm\r\nthis. We must therefore assume complicity of a double nature: by the\r\nfreighter's commanding officer, Captain James Summerfield, and by\r\nsomeone in a position of high command on the Station.\"\r\n\r\nAfter that, there was no silencing the slow, relentless events on Earth.\r\n\r\nA week after the tragedy, a U. S. Marine corporal stationed at Port\r\nForrestal, Wisconsin, put through a late afternoon phono-view call to\r\nhis wife. His face on the screen was haggard with strain, and he seemed\r\nnot to want to meet his wife's gaze.\r\n\r\n\"We've been ordered out into space,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You mean they're sending you out to take over the Station?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're sending out five thousand United States Marines,\" the corporal\r\nsaid. \"We all knew it was coming. We expected it when that Governmental\r\nInvestigating Committee was turned back.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it doesn't make sense. I can't understand it. Why should the\r\nCommander of the Station refuse to permit a Governmental Investigating\r\nCommittee to land?\"\r\n\r\n\"We don't know. He must have something to conceal, and you can be\r\npretty sure it's an ugly something. When that freighter disaster got\r\ninto every daily press conference of the high brass I knew this was\r\ncoming. I felt it in my bones.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what will happen if the Commander refuses to let even the Marines\r\nland? What will happen then?\"\r\n\r\n\"We may have to open fire on the Station,\" the corporal said. \"If the\r\nStation is in criminal hands we'll have no alternative.\"\r\n\r\n\"You talk as if you were in command.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess every soldier talks like that when his life is in jeopardy.\r\nBut I'm glad I'm not a five-star general. If I had to make a decision\r\nlike that--\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it wasn't a general who made the crucial decision. It was Admiral\r\nJohn Hayes, Commander of the Eighth Spatial Naval Division, acting on\r\nbehalf of fifty-seven nations.\r\n\r\nHe stood in the bridge room of a United States naval cruiser of massive\r\ntonnage, staring out through a wide-view observation port at the\r\nStation's glimmering immensity. The cruiser and the Station were moving\r\nat almost the same speed, fifteen thousand miles an hour. But now the\r\ncruiser was moving just a little faster than the Station, and Admiral\r\nHayes was growing impatient.\r\n\r\nManeuvering into an orbital position almost directly abreast of the\r\nStation had been difficult. Commander Hayes' nerves were badly frayed;\r\nand he was not a man who could endure too much frustration. He had\r\nsignaled the Station twice and received no reply. During that time,\r\nboth the Station and the Cruiser had completely encircled the Earth at\r\nan interval of just a little under two hours.\r\n\r\nHe turned suddenly from the viewport, his lips set in tight lines. He\r\nstared for an instant in silence at the young officer at his side, his\r\nmind groping for an argument which would completely justify what he had\r\nalready decided he must do.\r\n\r\nBut Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Archer spoke first, saying quietly:\r\n\"You have no choice, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHayes' features relaxed a little. It was good to know that he had\r\nsupport from a man whose judgment he respected. For an instant the\r\nawful aloneness which went with supreme command weighed less heavily\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\n\"It's absolute defiance, open rebellion,\" Hayes said. \"I'm forced\r\nto assume that the Station is in criminal hands. We'll never know,\r\nprobably, just _what_ happened on board that freighter. But we do know\r\nthat accidents occur. For every thirty ships that berth securely, one\r\nmeets with some kind of navigational mishap. The damage isn't always\r\nirreparable. More often than not, in fact, it's quite minor. Usually\r\nit means only a delay in berthing, a navigational shift, a circling\r\nback for another try. But apparently that freighter really _had_ it.\r\nSo it gave the show away. Commander Clement must be in league, hand in\r\nglove, with whoever is interested in smuggling unauthorized uranium\r\nshipments through to Earth for his own personal profit. And to hasten\r\nhis immediate profit that someone apparently found it to his advantage\r\nto trigger a little of the shipment into highly fissionable material on\r\nMars.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know as well as I do who the someone is, sir,\" Archer said.\r\n\r\n\"I guess we both know. But right now my only concern is with the\r\nStation. If they ignore my third order to stand by for boarding I'll\r\nhave to open fire. The Station's stolen property just as long as it\r\nremains in criminal hands. You can't get a desperate criminal to\r\nsurrender your property unless you convince him his own life is in\r\ndanger. I've got to try my best to convince Commander Clement I mean\r\nbusiness without destroying the Station.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll damage it to some extent, sir. How bad do you think it will be?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I don't intend to launch an atomic warhead. But I can't\r\nstop short of that if he stays stubborn. I've no way of knowing what\r\nhis breaking point will be. But I do know that if he keeps control of\r\nthe Station he'll be in a position to wipe out New York or London.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you'll make your intentions unmistakably clear before you open\r\nfire, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Hayes said, wearily. \"Yes ... of course I will.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\nCorriston took a deep breath and let it out slowly. So far luck had\r\nfavored him. Now he felt as though he were walking through a deadly\r\njungle where all the animals had suddenly turned friendly. The teeth\r\nthey bared at him were smiling. The grins were their masks. But the\r\ncommander didn't pretend at all ... whoever the commander really was!\r\n\r\nAnd then that single question began to gnaw at Corriston like some rat\r\nfeeding on his flesh: Where was the real Clement now? Was he alive? Was\r\nhe accessible? Or was he dead?\r\n\r\nCorriston's mental processes were now governed by the most evanescent\r\nof impressions: the depth of the shadows on both sides of the corridor;\r\nhis own shadow lengthening before him; the drone of machinery deep\r\nwithin the Station; the muffled beating of his own heart. Suddenly he\r\nwas at the end of the corridor and approaching the main control room,\r\nhis face as grim as death.\r\n\r\nViolence he had determined upon, but it would be a very brief, a very\r\neffective kind of violence. It takes only a second to rip a mask from a\r\nman's face.\r\n\r\nSomething was happening just outside the main control room door. The\r\nthree executive officers guarding the door had moved eight or ten paces\r\ndown the corridor, and the door itself was standing ajar. The executive\r\nofficers had their backs turned to Corriston and were making no attempt\r\nto conceal their agitation. They were very pale, at least, one of them\r\nwas. Two had their backs completely turned, but Corriston caught a\r\nbrief glimpse of the third man's profile, and it seemed completely\r\ndrained of color, as if the mask had stopped mirroring emotion\r\nartificially and had allowed the wearer's actual pallor to seep through.\r\n\r\nCorriston glided quickly to the door, passed through it and shut it\r\nvery quietly behind him.\r\n\r\nThe commander had his back turned too. He was standing before the\r\nviewport, staring out into space.\r\n\r\nBut the commander did seem dazed, did seem stunned. Corriston could\r\ntell by his posture, by the way he held his shoulders, by the utter\r\nrigidity of his neck.\r\n\r\nThen he saw it, the long cylindrical hull touched by a pale glimmer of\r\nstarlight, the circular, glowing ports, the massive, atomic-projectile\r\nlaunching turrets at its base. He saw it through the viewport, saw it\r\npast the commander's stiffening shoulders--an American war cruiser of\r\nformidable tonnage and armed with sufficient fire power to shatter a\r\nsmall moon.\r\n\r\nAll right, let the Big Dark contain it for a moment, poised out there,\r\nready for any contingency. Right at the moment a scoundrel must be\r\nunmasked in a very stark way. Whatever trouble he had brought upon\r\nhimself, he must be made to face it now without the mask.\r\n\r\nCorriston unholstered his gun and walked toward the commander across\r\nthe deck. He came up behind him and thrust the gun into the small of\r\nhis back.\r\n\r\n\"Turn around,\" he ordered. \"Don't make any other move. Just turn slowly\r\nand face me. I want to take a good look at your face.\"\r\n\r\nIf the commander was startled, he didn't show it. Perhaps the\r\nwar cruiser had dealt him such a crushing blow that he was no\r\nlonger capable of experiencing shock. Or his control may have been\r\nextraordinary. Corriston had no way of knowing and it didn't concern\r\nhim too much.\r\n\r\nHe was chiefly interested in the commander's eyes. He had never before\r\nseen eyes quite so piercing in their stare or narrowed in quite such an\r\nugly way.\r\n\r\nThe commander spoke almost instantly and his voice had a steel-cold\r\nrasp. \"Well?\" he said.\r\n\r\nJust a few words--just the shortest possible question he could have\r\nasked.\r\n\r\nCorriston said: \"You're wearing a mask, aren't you, commander?\"\r\n\r\nThe impostor's expression did not change, but his hand went\r\ninstinctively to his throat.\r\n\r\n\"Remove your tie and unbutton your collar,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\nThe man made another quick gesture with his hand in the direction of\r\nhis throat. But it seemed involuntary, protective, for he did not touch\r\nhis collar.\r\n\r\nCorriston shifted his weapon a little, moving the barrel upward until\r\nit pressed very firmly against the commander's breastbone. He reached\r\nout and unbuttoned the commander's collar with his free hand, very\r\nquickly and expertly.\r\n\r\nHe was staring at the tiny hooks at the base of the mask when something\r\nhappened which made him regret that he had not followed his original\r\nintention of instantly ripping the mask from the man's face.\r\n\r\nThe door opened and the three executive officers came into the control\r\nroom. For an instant they seemed neither to see nor understand the\r\nsituation. They must have seen Corriston, but the fact that he was\r\nwearing a guard's uniform may have given them the idea that he had\r\nevery right to be there. The gun was concealed from view and the\r\ncommander was standing very quietly by the viewport and quite obviously\r\nincapable of making any move, simply because the slightest move would\r\nhave endangered his life.\r\n\r\nSo the executive officers went right on talking for an instant, half to\r\nthemselves and half to the commander, just as if Corriston had not been\r\npresent at all.\r\n\r\n\"If that cruiser lands, Ramsey's goose is cooked and ours is too,\" a\r\ntall officer said. \"The instant that freighter crashed I knew they'd\r\nfind out quickly enough how the ships had been carrying smuggled\r\nuranium. I knew that under pressure, half of our captains would\r\ntalk ... and the crews, too. All the government would have to do is\r\ncheck and they'd find out that we're Ramsey's men, all of us. They\r\nmight even now know about the masks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not about the masks?\" another officer joined in. \"Ramsey paid for\r\nthe research that went into them, didn't he? Big tycoon ... fingers in\r\na dozen pies. When the secret's out, and he puts them on the market,\r\nhe'll make important money out of it. But we'll be in prison with just\r\nour own faces staring back at us from a steel wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about that. Ramsey won't profit from the manufacture of\r\nmasks. He won't even profit from the false uranium clearance we gave\r\nhim. If that cruiser is allowed to land he'll be in prison with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Better think that over, Commander. You refused to let the Governmental\r\nInvestigating Committee land. If a single soldier sets foot on the\r\nStation we're done for. It's not too late to do something about it.\r\nThat cruiser can only berth by overtaking us. If we change our orbit\r\nfast and start blasting at them with our rear adjusting rockets they'll\r\nhave to keep their distance?\"\r\n\r\n\"Aren't you forgetting something? A single atomic warhead could blow\r\nthe Station apart.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got to risk that. They'll think a long time before they'll go\r\nthat far. The Station's not expendible. If we change our orbit we can\r\nstill make contact with the Mars ship that's due to berth in an hour.\r\nWe've got to get back to Mars and whatever protection Ramsey can give\r\nus. We'll have his daughter with us. He'll be so glad to see her he'll\r\ngo out on a limb to protect us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He'd go out on a limb anyway; He'd have to in order to save himself.\r\nBut sure, we'll take the girl. No harm in that. He knows she's here\r\nand will be expecting her. He'll thank us for taking things so quickly\r\nin hand. If that crazy lieutenant had made his story public that\r\ncruiser would have been out there anyway--perhaps even sooner. They'd\r\nhave wanted to know on Earth why anyone would want to harm Ramsey's\r\ndaughter, something we don't know ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston decided then that he'd kept silent long enough. He returned\r\nhis gun to its holster, and walked up to the three executive officers,\r\ncompletely ignoring the commander.\r\n\r\nHe heard the commander threaten him in a low tone, heard him say words\r\nwhich would have caused some men to pause in fear. But Corriston did\r\nnot turn.\r\n\r\nThere was stunned disbelief in the eyes of the three men facing him. He\r\nspoke quickly, knowing that he had only a moment before the commander\r\nwould see that he was seized and restrained. He had to make sure that\r\nthe three would hear him out, that the commander would not be instantly\r\nobeyed. Perhaps he couldn't make sure, but at least he could try.\r\n\r\n\"I'll make a bargain with you,\" he said. \"I've done reckless things\r\nbut I'm not a complete fool. You're going to prevent that cruiser from\r\nberthing and I won't be able to interfere. I'm just one man against\r\nseveral hundred. All three of you are armed. If I started shooting I'd\r\nget perhaps two of you--no more. Then you'd kill me. I haven't even the\r\nadvantage of surprise. I gave that up because I can't believe you're\r\ncomplete fools either.\r\n\r\n\"First, I want to see Helen Ramsey. I want you to let me talk to her.\r\nAnd when the Mars' ship berths, I want to go to Mars with her. I've\r\nsomething to offer in return.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the officers stared at him, tightened his lips and stared\r\nharder. \"Good God!\" he muttered. \"Good God! A bargain. You must be out\r\nof your mind. What could you possibly offer? If you had a gun trained\r\non us--\"\r\n\r\n\"A witness in your defense,\" Corriston said. \"A witness who will stand\r\nup in court and swear that you did try to protect Helen Ramsey, that\r\nyou saved her from a very great danger. You may think that you do not\r\nneed a witness now, but before the year is out Ramsey will be on trial\r\nfor his life. His wealth won't save him. They know too much about him\r\nnow. That freighter explosion killed too many people. The public\r\noutcry will be too great.\r\n\r\n\"If you stay on Mars you'll be hunted down like wild animals. They'll\r\nget you in the end and you know it. You'll be brought back to Earth;\r\nyou'll stand trial.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston paused for the barest instant, knowing that the commander too\r\nwas listening, knowing from the absence of sound and movement behind\r\nhim that his words were being weighed. \"I think you know that I would\r\nnot break my word. I'll stand up in court and defend you under oath.\r\nI'll be speaking the simple truth. You _did_ save Helen Ramsey from a\r\nvery great danger; you probably saved her life. That is sure to weigh\r\nin your favor with any impartial judge and jury. You won't get the\r\ndeath penalty; I can promise you that.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the commander who spoke first. He said, very quietly. \"He's\r\nright, of course. Completely right.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the officers nodded. \"There's no reason why we shouldn't let him\r\ntalk to the girl. We can decide later whether we like his offer.\"\r\n\r\n\"We're going to like it,\" the commander said, coming around in front of\r\nCorriston. \"He has more sense than I would have given him credit for.\"\r\n\r\n\"So have you, commander,\" Corriston said, and meant it.\r\n\r\nThe commander's eyes were still hostile, unfriendly, but the cold rage\r\nhad gone out of them.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said. \"Let him see the girl now. Make sure a guard is\r\nstationed at the door. Keeping that cruiser from berthing won't be\r\neasy. They'll keep the Station under fire with small projectiles, even\r\nif they don't attack us with atomic warheads. They'll risk some damage\r\njust to throw a scare into us.\"\r\n\r\nThe officer next to Corriston nudged his arm. \"All right,\" he said.\r\n\"But remember this when you talk to her. She doesn't know the truth\r\nabout us. She doesn't even know we're wearing masks. We'd like it\r\nbetter if you didn't say anything about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whether she knows it or not isn't too important,\" Corriston said. \"I\r\nsuppose you wouldn't care to tell me what you've done with Commander\r\nClement and the other officers.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, we wouldn't care to tell you. Anything more?\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess not,\" Corriston said. \"Take me to her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12\r\n\r\n\r\nHe was staring at her across a shadowed room, with the pale glimmer\r\nof a cabin viewport above her right shoulder, a very small port that\r\nlooked like a full moon glimmering high in the sky through a sea of\r\nmist.\r\n\r\nHer face was very white and she was staring back at him as if he had\r\ncome suddenly out of nowhere.\r\n\r\nShe hesitated only an instant and then walked straight toward him,\r\nwalked right up to him and touched him gently on the face.\r\n\r\n\"I'm so glad,\" she said.\r\n\r\nShe drew back then and looked at him and smiled. \"I was afraid you were\r\nin trouble because of me,\" she said, \"some terrible kind of trouble,\r\nand I couldn't help you at all. I kept blaming myself for everything\r\nfoolish that I had ever done, going way back to the day when I broke\r\nmy first doll, deliberately and spitefully, because I was a very\r\nheadstrong little girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I've always been pretty headstrong myself,\" Corriston said.\r\n\"But being a boy, I naturally couldn't break dolls. I just wrecked the\r\nfamily's peace of mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"We all go through life with a great deal of foolish luggage,\" she\r\nsaid. \"And sometimes you have an impulse to just drop everything--and\r\nrun away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can understand that,\" Corriston said. \"But did you have to run\r\naway quite so fast? It's hard to believe it was for anybody's good,\r\nincluding your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might have been,\" she said. \"It might have been for my good and\r\nthen later, partly for your good. Please don't judge me too harshly\r\nbefore I've had a chance to tell you exactly what happened.\"\r\n\r\nHe reached out for her and kissed her even as she came into his arms.\r\nHe had expected her to be angry, to withdraw, but instead she encircled\r\nhis strong back with a surprising fierceness. When he released her, her\r\neyes were shining.\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you did that ... darling! Very glad. But we're still in\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that. But we're in love, too. And you just promised to tell me\r\nwhat happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I guess I just ... just regressed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Regressed. You know, like when I was a headstrong little brat of a\r\nchild. We all do that at times. You'll have to admit there was some\r\nexcuse for me. You weren't born in a house with a hundred rooms, with\r\nservants always coming and going, and outside gardens with big red\r\nand yellow flowers where you couldn't even run and hide without being\r\nsmothered, without being searched for and brought screaming and kicking\r\nback inside.\r\n\r\n\"You don't know what it means to know you haven't a father, only\r\na stern, cold, black-coated man standing away off in the darkness\r\nsomewhere and watching people bow down before him.\r\n\r\n\"You don't know what it means to be told: 'You're Stephen Ramsey's\r\ndaughter. _Behave. Behave. Behave!_'\"\r\n\r\n\"I scarcely ever saw my father. And when I did see him he was as cold\r\nas one of the slabs in the big mausoleum he took so much pride in, the\r\nbig family mausoleum which only a Ramsey was permitted to visit. And\r\nyet I think he loved me in his own cold way. I think he still does.\"\r\n\r\nShe fell silent for a moment and then an overpowering need to tell\r\nCorriston more seemed to come upon her.\r\n\r\n\"I was never allowed to see young men, not even to go for a ride in the\r\npark. Anyone of them might be a fortune seeker, because no young man,\r\neven if he is madly in love with a girl, can quite shut his eyes to\r\nwealth as one additional reason for loving her.\r\n\r\n\"So I never saw any young men. I wasn't permitted to even go to a\r\ndance, or walk in the moonlight on a balcony. I wanted to go to dances,\r\nwanted at least one young man to kiss me damned hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure you did,\" Corriston said. \"I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm going to stop right there, darling. I could tell you what it means\r\nto be free to travel, anywhere, anywhere in the world and to see all of\r\nthe white and shining cities, and to be intoxicated by beauty, and to\r\nknow at the same time that you are not free, can never hope to be free\r\nas other people are free.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's why you ran away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, darling, yes, and because that bodyguard was a complete fool.\r\nHe was just one of thirty bodyguards my father had hired to protect\r\nme, year after year. But he was the biggest fool of all. He drank too\r\nmuch and he talked too much. Finally I made up my mind that I would be\r\nbetter off if I went on to Mars alone. My father had told me I could\r\ncome, the trip had been carefully planned down to the smallest detail.\r\nI was to travel incognito. I was to keep to myself until I arrived at\r\nthe Station and no one was supposed to know I was even on the ship, not\r\neven the captain. I'm quite sure he didn't know. I think the invitation\r\nto his cabin was a complete fabrication. In fact, I'm sure it was. I\r\nthink Clakey--his real name was Ewers--was just drunk enough to make up\r\na crazy story like that to get me away from you.\r\n\r\n\"But I didn't want to get away from you, darling. I wanted to get away\r\nfrom him. I wanted to have a few days of complete freedom before I\r\narrived on Mars, and perhaps after that for a day in the colony before\r\nI joined my father. I didn't care how angry he'd be when he saw me\r\nwithout a bodyguard, alone, wonderfully, gloriously alone and free for\r\nthe first time in my life. I didn't want to be Helen Ramsey at all. I\r\nwanted to be somebody else and be completely free.\r\n\r\n\"So I went into the ladies room, darling, and I put on the strangest\r\nkind of mask.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Corriston said. \"I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know about the mask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please go on,\" Corriston said. \"I'd rather you didn't ask me how I\r\nknow that your father can take pride in at least one constructive\r\nachievement. The masks are extraordinary. I've seen one.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how? Where? I can't believe it. I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Please,\" Corriston said. \"It isn't too important. I made a necessary\r\npromise that I wouldn't tell you, not immediately. I'm asking you to\r\ntrust me and go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I secured one of those very unusual masks. From the\r\nGresham-Ramsey Laboratories, before we left Earth. I could go there\r\nanytime I wanted to. All of the research technicians there are quite\r\nold. One of them, Thomas Webb, is really quite handsome. I might have\r\nfallen in love with him if he had been forty years younger. He showed\r\nme just how to adjust the mask. But when I went into the ladies' lounge\r\nI had more than just a mask. I had a complete thin plastic change of\r\nclothing concealed under my dress. I didn't remove my dress, only\r\nreversed my clothing so that the plastic dress covered the one I'd been\r\nwearing.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston said, \"It was a very courageous thing for you to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm glad you think so, darling. Because when I came out of the\r\nlounge and saw Ewers killed, I wasn't courageous at all. I became\r\npanic-stricken, terrified, beside myself with fear. I knew that my\r\nfather had many dangerous enemies. I knew that I was in immediate,\r\ndeadly danger. I _had_ to go on with the disguise then. I had to go\r\nright on being somebody else. I couldn't tell anyone. I couldn't even\r\ntell you. I had to let you think that in some strange, bewildering way\r\nI had gone into the lounge and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\"I knew you wouldn't really believe that, not for a moment. But I\r\ndidn't know what you'd think. I _could_ have told you, I suppose, but\r\nI was afraid it would only make the danger greater, might transfer\r\nsome of the danger to you. And I didn't know you'd go straight to the\r\ncaptain and get yourself into trouble. There were rumors on the Station\r\nthat you'd been confined, put under guard. But they were only rumors.\r\nI felt I had to see you, talk to you. I was half out of my mind with\r\nanxiety. I bribed one of the guards to let me out of the quarantine\r\ncage and went in search of you.\r\n\r\n\"I searched everywhere, followed passageways at random, got lost in a\r\nmaze of machinery.\"\r\n\r\n\"And someone followed you,\" Corriston said. \"He followed you and tore\r\nthe mask from your face.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with wide, startled eyes. \"How did you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was there,\" Corriston said. \"You fainted and I took you into my\r\narms--for the very first time. You didn't know that, did you?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I have known? If what you say is true, I--\"\r\n\r\nHelen Ramsey did not complete what she had started to say. Had she\r\ndone so she might not have been thrown so abruptly off-balance by the\r\nsuddenly lurching deck; she would have moved closer to Corriston and\r\ncould have seized hold of his shoulders for support.\r\n\r\nShe did not fall, but she nearly did, and the lurch sent her tottering\r\nall the way to the opposite wall. Corriston saw her collide with the\r\nwall and sink to her knees. At the same instant his own knees collapsed.\r\n\r\nHe was lying sprawled out on the deck, too startled and shaken to go\r\nimmediately to her aid, when the second lurch came. It spun him about,\r\nand then he was sliding. He couldn't seem to stop the sliding. He went\r\nall the way to the opposite wall too.\r\n\r\nFor a brief instant they were together again, locked in a desperate\r\nembrace, their legs higher than their heads. Then the deck righted\r\nitself and the bombardment began.\r\n\r\nIt was a terrifying thing to have to listen to, and Corriston preferred\r\nto listen to it on his feet. Slowly he arose and helped his companion\r\nup, holding her in so tight a grip that it seemed to them that they had\r\nbeen welded together and could never part.\r\n\r\nHe was glad that he could be completely sure of one thing. It wasn't\r\na nuclear bombardment--not yet. The cruiser was merely shelling the\r\nStation. When the cruiser launched an atomic warhead he'd know about\r\nit--rather, he wouldn't know. The fact that he was still alive and\r\naware of what was going on told him a great deal about the nature of\r\nthe bombardment.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" Helen Ramsey whispered. \"Do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"We're the catspaw in a naval attack,\" Corriston said. \"The commander\r\ntook a very great risk.\"\r\n\r\nIt was incredible, but right at the moment he felt himself to be in the\r\nscoundrel's corner. He didn't want the Station to be blown apart in the\r\ngreat empty spaces between the planets any more than the commander did.\r\n\r\nWhen Corriston reached the viewport and stared out, the cruiser was\r\nfollowing the Station far off to the side, in an obvious effort to\r\noutmaneuver it by maintaining a parallel rather than a directly\r\npursuing course. But it was not escaping the swiftly turning Station's\r\nstern rocket jets. Blinding bursts of incandescence spiraled toward it\r\nthrough the void, and once or twice scored direct hits.\r\n\r\nHe saw the cruiser shudder throughout its length, and then draw back,\r\nalmost as if it were endowed with life and had nerves and arteries that\r\ncould be ripped apart.\r\n\r\nThere _were_ mechanical arteries that could easily enough be ripped.\r\nFor an instant Corriston stared with a strange kind of detachment,\r\nfreed from the terrible tension and uncertainty by his absolute\r\nabsorption in the battle itself, freed from the almost mind-numbing\r\nsense of participating in a struggle that could end in utter disaster\r\nfor Station and cruiser alike. He knew that if the cruiser maneuvered\r\nin too close, the puffs of flame from the Station's jets could turn\r\ninto superheated gases roaring through space, destroying everything in\r\ntheir path.\r\n\r\nThe Station, too, was only a pulsebeat from fiery annihilation. And a\r\npulsebeat could be terrifyingly brief. But the decision had been made\r\nand there could be no turning back.\r\n\r\nAboard the cruiser the decision had certainly come from very high up.\r\nCorriston turned the thought slowly over in his mind, still in the grip\r\nof his strange detachment. Just what did \"very high up\" mean?\r\n\r\nIt meant--it had to mean--a conflict of personalities, the\r\nhot-headedness or stubbornness or glory-seeking that went with every\r\ndecision made by strong-willed men.\r\n\r\nAboard the cruiser someone had acted. After consultation? On just an\r\nimpulse? In blind rage because the Station had ignored a warning that\r\nhad been repeated twice?\r\n\r\nThere was no way of knowing. But on the cruiser men were dying. That\r\nwas important too. Just how reckless had the decision been?\r\n\r\nIn space, military science has never been an exact science. Sonic\r\nechoes alone can kill, and in a pressurized compartment blowups happen.\r\nJet-supports can be placed at the best of all possible angles and still\r\nfly off into space. Compressed air shot out of pressure vents can turn\r\nbone and flesh into soft oozing jelly.\r\n\r\nThe cruiser was changing its course again. It had failed, in a\r\nmaneuver, twice repeated, to draw close at almost right angles to\r\nthe Station, and had taken terrible punishment from below, above and\r\nstraight ahead.\r\n\r\nBut the cruiser was still firing. And Corriston not only saw the bursts\r\nof flame, he felt the blasts in his eardrums, his brain and the soles\r\nof his feet. And suddenly he saw flames darting out directly beneath\r\nhim, and knew that the Station was on fire.\r\n\r\nCorriston knew that at any moment he could be smashed back against\r\na bone-crushing wall of metal; he could be pulverized, asphyxiated,\r\ndriven mad. And the fear in him--the fear that he wouldn't be able to\r\ncontrol--would be a two-edged sword.\r\n\r\nThere was no pain more ghastly than the final burst of agony that came\r\nwith a burst open nervous system. It was the most horrible way to die.\r\nBut even dying that way wouldn't be half as bad as watching the woman\r\nhe loved die.\r\n\r\nAlmost as if aware of his thoughts, Helen spoke to him for the first\r\ntime since he had crossed to the viewport.\r\n\r\n\"It's very strange, darling. I'm calmer now than I have ever been. I\r\nguess it can happen if you love a man so very much that you know your\r\nlife would have no meaning if anything should happen to him. It's like\r\nfacing up squarely to the fact that you no longer have any existence\r\napart from him. I've done that, darling, and I'm not afraid.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence in the cabin for an instant. Then another shell\r\nexploded, and another, and another. Corriston felt light and\r\ndangerously dizzy. It was amazing that he had not been hurled to the\r\nfloor, still more amazing that he could have remained for so long\r\nmotionless in just one spot.\r\n\r\nThen, abruptly, the bombardment ceased. There was no sound at all in\r\nthe cabin, just a silence so absolute that the roaring in Corriston's\r\nears was like the sound made by an angry sea beating against vast stone\r\ncliffs in a world that had ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThere were no longer any exploding white stars coming from the cruiser.\r\nIt was dwindling into the blackness of space, giving up the battle,\r\nconceding defeat. It became thinner and thinner. Suddenly only the reef\r\nremained. Where the cruiser had been there stretched only empty space.\r\n\r\nCorriston turned from the viewport. He crossed the cabin to the cot,\r\nswaying a little, but only from dizziness, and sat down and drew the\r\ngirl on the cot close to him. He held her tightly, saying nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13\r\n\r\n\r\nCorriston was still sitting on the cot when the door opened and the\r\ncommander and two executive officers came into the cabin.\r\n\r\nHe was not too surprised, for it had been somehow almost impossible for\r\nhim to believe that the commander could have been killed. A scoundrel's\r\nluck and a drunkard's luck were often very much the same thing.\r\n\r\nIf the commander had succeeded in quickly putting out the fire he rated\r\na medal, he was a man for all of that.\r\n\r\nAnd apparently the commander _had_ succeeded in putting out the fire,\r\nor he would not now be facing Corriston with a grimly urgent look on\r\nhis mask.\r\n\r\nHelen Ramsey was staring at him almost as if she were seeing him as he\r\nreally was for the first time. Did she know that he was wearing a mask?\r\nThere was no possible way she could know, he told himself, except by\r\nintuition. The masks were good. Having worn one herself she ought to\r\nknow how good they were. She ought not even to suspect the commander\r\nunless--\r\n\r\nCorriston had no time to finish the thought.\r\n\r\n\"Get up, both of you,\" the commander said, gesturing with his braided\r\nright arm. \"The Mars ship has just berthed. We've got to go aboard\r\nbefore there's any question as to the obedience of the crew. The\r\ncaptain has been taken off, but we're keeping some of the crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"You--you put out the fire, Commander?\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally. I'm not quite the incompetent you think me, Lieutenant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm quite sure of that, Commander,\" Corriston said. \"Do we take\r\nanything with us?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll get all the extras you need on Mars,\" the commander said.\r\n\"Stephen Ramsey isn't likely to want to see his daughter go about in\r\nrags.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston decided that the wisest thing he could do was to take the\r\ncommander at his word in every important respect; for the moment,\r\nat any rate. There was the little matter of a killer still at large\r\nsomewhere on the Station, and the quicker they were in space the safer\r\nRamsey's daughter would be. Not just in space as the Station was in\r\nspace, but much further out in the Big Dark.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Commander,\" he said. \"Let's get started.\"\r\n\r\nGetting started took very little time. A great thankfulness came upon\r\nCorriston when he saw the smooth dark hull of the Mars ship looming\r\nhigh above him, a thousand foot long cylinder of inky blackness against\r\na glimmering wilderness of stars.\r\n\r\nThe ship was berthed securely beneath a towering network of telemetric\r\naerials, on a completely circular launching platform that was like a\r\nsaucer in reverse, with a contractable metal ramp leading up to the\r\nwide-open, brightly lighted boarding port at its base.\r\n\r\nThere were steps on the ramp, but Corriston knew that when the\r\nstructure was drawn back into the ship it would collapse like a house\r\nof cards, folded back upon itself.\r\n\r\nHelen Ramsey ascended first. Corriston made certain that she would by\r\ngetting in the commander's way with a convincing show of accidental\r\nclumsiness. He pretended to stumble as he began the ascent, to be all\r\nhands and feet.\r\n\r\nThe commander swore softly and Corriston was quite sure that he had\r\nnot been deceived. But there was very little that he could do about it\r\nunder the circumstances. He had to let Ramsey's daughter climb the ramp\r\nfirst and she was almost at the top before Corriston started up.\r\n\r\nCorriston was halfway to the top, and the commander and the impatient,\r\ntight-lipped executive officers were just starting up, when three tall\r\nfigures emerged from the darkness at the base of the ramp.\r\n\r\nThe attack took place so quickly that it was over almost before it\r\nstarted. The commander and the executive officers didn't have a chance.\r\nOne of the emerging men had a gun, and he shot the commander in the\r\nstomach with it at almost point-blank range.\r\n\r\nThe commander sank down, clutching at his stomach, bent nearly double.\r\nEven from where Corriston was standing, he could see the blood\r\ntrickling down his right leg. The terrible dark wetness directly\r\nover the wound was of course invisible, completely concealed by the\r\ncommander's tightly laced arms.\r\n\r\nThe startled, badly frightened officers turned and tried to get away.\r\nBut they didn't get far. The man who had shot the commander picked them\r\noff like clay pigeons, one by one, as they fled.\r\n\r\nHis two companions did not even seem to be armed. They just stood\r\nquietly watching the executive officers die. They died on the launching\r\nplatform and on the smooth deck beyond, two of them simply dropping in\r\ntheir tracks, a third sprawling grotesquely, and the last staggering\r\non for a few paces. There were four executive officers, and not one\r\nescaped. It was butchery, pure and simple, cruel, savage beyond belief.\r\n\r\nHelen Ramsey was already on the ship, and there was no possible way for\r\nhim to get her off.\r\n\r\nThe thought that he was himself in the deadliest kind of danger never\r\neven crossed his mind.\r\n\r\nThe killer returned his gun to its holster very slowly and\r\ndeliberately, and then he took it out again. It was a very strange\r\ngesture, when every passing second must have been of vital importance\r\nto him, but it revealed something very unusual about the man. He\r\nevidently liked to feel that he had completed one job and packaged it\r\nto his entire satisfaction, before going on to another.\r\n\r\nIt was that more than anything else which jolted Corriston into\r\ncomplete awareness, and made it impossible for him to doubt the\r\nreality, the utter horror, of what had taken place. The killer had\r\ngestured to his companions, and he was coming up the ramp.\r\n\r\nHe came slowly up the ramp, and for the first time Corriston saw his\r\nface. It was not a face that he would ever forget or ever want to\r\nforget. It was the face of the man he had grappled with in the dark and\r\nseen once in the light. But now his features were turned away. It was\r\nexactly the kind of face which Corriston had pictured him as having,\r\nexcept that it was just a little uglier looking. The slant of the\r\ncheekbones even crueler, harsher, the eyes more venomously narrowed,\r\nthe mouth an uglier gash.\r\n\r\n\"All right, Lieutenant,\" he said, gesturing with the gun. \"Go on ahead.\r\nGo on board. We're going to need you to help pilot this ship to Mars.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14\r\n\r\n\r\nThe silence in the chart room was like the hush that comes over a\r\ndesert when hurricane winds have died down, or like the stillness of a\r\nrocky coast when waves have ceased to pound, and dangerous rocks stand\r\nout with all of their saw-edged teeth exposed.\r\n\r\nIt was extraordinary how, at the point of a gun, a man could think and\r\nact almost automatically, and postpone making any decision at all. It\r\nwasn't cowardice; Corriston was quite sure of that. He felt only anger,\r\ndeep, relentless, all-consuming. Sweat oozed in droplets from his\r\nbrow, but it was the heat and the tension which made his skin stream\r\nwith moisture. There was no immediate fear in him at all.\r\n\r\nHe'd kept fear at bay by refusing to let his mind leap ahead. Only the\r\ngun at his back mattered, and just why it should have mattered so much\r\nwas the only thing that puzzled him.\r\n\r\nIt did not occur to him that what some men dread most is the fear of\r\ndying too abruptly, without foreknowledge and with just a second's\r\nglimpse of something cold and deadly before the final blackout. A gun\r\nhad that kind of power.\r\n\r\nThe man with the gun had asked Corriston a great many questions,\r\nurgently practical questions that dealt with cold statistics concerning\r\nzero-gravity, solar radiation, space drift and the length of time it\r\nwould take to reach Mars if a single pilot took full advantage of the\r\nautomatic controls and never allowed himself to become reckless.\r\n\r\nCorriston had replied to the best of his ability and knowledge, and the\r\nother had accepted his answers with a quiet grunt of satisfaction. It\r\nwas only after that, when the silence had lengthened almost unendurably\r\nbetween them, that the more personal questions came.\r\n\r\nThe killer jabbed the gun more firmly against Corriston's spine and\r\nasked in a cold, flat voice: \"Do you know who I am, Corriston? Have you\r\nany idea?\"\r\n\r\nCorriston stared out the viewport for a moment without replying, his\r\nface deathly pale. \"I don't know your name,\" he said. \"Probably that's\r\nnot too important. I do know that you're a cold-blooded murderer, and\r\nthat killing gives you pleasure. I am very tired. I wish you wouldn't\r\nquestion me any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think you can pilot this ship to Mars, tired as you are?\"\r\n\r\nCorriston nodded.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of the gun barrel diminished. \"I am very glad--for your\r\nsake. I suppose I might as well tell you my name. It's Henley, Richard\r\nHenley. We'll be seeing a lot of each other before this trip is ended,\r\nbut you'll find that I'm not a particularly talkative man. When I have\r\nsomething important to say, though, I won't leave you in any doubt as\r\nto what I want done. Right now I must warn you that I would just as\r\nsoon kill you as not.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're lying,\" Corriston said. \"If you killed me now you'd never get\r\nto Mars. You need me and you know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Corriston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't assume too much. There are practical advantages in keeping you\r\nalive but a wrong move on your part could outweigh them. I'd have a\r\nfair chance of getting to Mars without your help. I know more than you\r\nthink about spatial navigation. And the automatic controls are far\r\nfrom unreliable. Without them it would take at least five men to pilot\r\na ship this size to Mars. With their aid a single experienced pilot\r\nshould be able to accomplish it. I'm pretty sure you've had enough\r\nofficer training school to qualify as a pilot. A ship's inspection\r\nofficer has to be able to navigate a ship; I've checked on that. But\r\nyou're certainly no expert, and if you force my hand I'll take my\r\nchance with the auto-controls and my own limited knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll be taking a chance, all right,\" Corriston said. \"What would you\r\ndo if the observation glass started showing small pits in the hull from\r\na very large shower of micro-meteorites? Can the auto-controls stop\r\nthose pits from spreading? I've seen a ship stippled all over in less\r\nthan ten minutes. The meteor guards won't deflect micro-meteorites,\r\nand you've got to alter your velocity and angle of drive and a lot of\r\nother things fast. And what happens when your instruments start showing\r\nlight spectra peculiarities that can't be measured in angstroms? Just\r\na little oddity like that can force you to change your course, but the\r\nauto-pilot won't know a thing about it.\r\n\r\n\"And when you hit the Martian atmosphere and start firing against\r\nthe direction of motion, how much good do you think limited knowledge\r\nwill do you? Remember, nearly all of the journey will have been made\r\nin free fall, and in free fall the auto-controls are fairly efficient.\r\nBut the instant you hit the atmosphere the slightest miscalculation in\r\nthe utilization of your fuel reserves can lead to absolute disaster. I\r\ndon't know what makes you tick, of course. You may get a distorted kind\r\nof pleasure from thinking of yourself as a man marked for death, the\r\nsame kind of pleasure you get from killing people.\"\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment. Then Henley drew in his breath sharply\r\nand said: \"Are you threatening me, Corriston?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just warning you,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\n\"I don't take kindly to warnings, Corriston. If you're not careful I'll\r\nput a bullet right through you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do the men who hired you know how you operate, Henley?\"\r\n\r\nIt was a stab in the dark, but it brought a quick, enraged reply. \"How\r\nI operate is my own business. And I don't like the word 'hire.' I'd\r\nadvise you not to use it again. Ramsey's uranium steal made every miner\r\non Mars decide straight off that I was the right man to lead them.\r\nThey're all in back of me, but they don't control me. I take orders\r\nfrom no one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maybe they wouldn't be in back of you if they knew what a scoundrel\r\nyou are,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\n\"You may think whatever you please. I don't mind your calling me a\r\nscoundrel if it will ease your mind. Just don't use the word 'hire.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why you should object to it,\" Corriston went on\r\nrecklessly. \"It protects you, in a way. It's a good word to hide\r\nbehind. If the colonists knew the truth about you, I don't think you'd\r\nlast very long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll last long enough to help you dig your own grave, Corriston,\r\nif you keep on with that line of talk. You're the real lucky one. I\r\nmissed killing you on the Station because my aim was bad. You were an\r\nunexpected complication and you were keeping me upset. I didn't like it\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead. I knew too much. Was that it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Partly. I didn't know how much you knew or how much you'd guessed. But\r\nyou were in a position to start a lot of high-powered stuff that could\r\nhave interfered with my plans in a dozen ways. Now I happen to need\r\nyou--to a limited extent. But I'm warning you again. Don't trade on\r\nyour luck. Don't force me to kill you, Corriston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I won't. Perhaps we can strike a compromise. As I see it,\r\nthere's no need for immediate violence. Suppose you take me just a\r\nlittle more fully into your confidence. It can do you no harm now; and\r\nthere are a few things I'm still curious about.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, Corriston. What is it you'd like to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"How did you manage to stay concealed on the Station when Ramsey's\r\nofficers were in full command? You had considerable freedom of\r\nmovement, apparently, even if you had to move with caution.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had everything planned in advance,\" Henley said. \"We got to one of\r\nRamsey's men with bribe money the miners raised, an executive officer\r\nnamed Stockton. We made it worth his while. We had a carefully worked\r\nout plan for smuggling Helen Ramsey off the shuttle ship and keeping\r\nher hidden until the Mars ship arrived. Stockton had everything\r\nprepared: a concealed compartment, food, made our problem more\r\ncomplicated. Stockton helped us get out of the quarantine cage and kept\r\nright on protecting us until we no longer needed him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must have known about the masks. You must have known before\r\nyou arrived that Ramsey's men were in complete control of the Station.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure we knew, long before Earth found out. We know exactly what had\r\ntaken place. You'd be surprised what a few carefully placed bribes can\r\ndo. We knew that Ramsey had laid himself wide open by substituting his\r\nown men for the Station's commanding officers. We knew exactly how\r\nvulnerable he was.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Corriston said. \"Ramsey was so vulnerable that any determined\r\nattack made upon him would have had a fair chance of succeeding. But\r\nyou worked out a plan for striking at him in a wholly criminal way,\r\nthrough his daughter. Did the miners know that, Henley? Or did they\r\njust give you their backing in a general way? You probably seemed to\r\nthem the kind of man who would go after Ramsey hammer and tongs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose we just say they knew I'd find a way to make Ramsey meet\r\nall of our demands.\" Henley smiled thinly. \"The details they left to\r\nme.\" He paused an instant, then went on: \"Right after Helen Ramsey\r\ndisappeared, I did some hard thinking. It occurred to me that she might\r\nbe wearing a mask too. So I watched all of the women in the quarantine\r\ncage and when one of them slipped out I followed her.\"\r\n\r\n\"As simple as that!\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't simple. The girl's disappearance on the shuttle ship had me\r\ncompletely baffled at first. It wasn't until we reached the Station\r\nthat the mask possibility occurred to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"We talked about that once before, remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were lucky then, Corriston. I tried very hard to kill you, simply\r\nbecause I thought you knew more about Helen Ramsey's disappearance than\r\nyou actually did. In that dark cargo compartment, with time running out\r\non me, I couldn't think very clearly. Anything more you'd like to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. How many men did Ramsey succeed in substituting for the rightful\r\nofficers? How many, beside the commander?\"\r\n\r\n\"Eight, including the commander. His real name was Henry Hervet. Five\r\nwere executive officers, two were security guards. They're all dead\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston's mouth went dry. \"Including the one who sold out and helped\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Stockton was the first to die. He was dead before the others\r\ntried to board this ship. I made sure of that. He was too greedy for\r\nhis own good.\"\r\n\r\n\"You got back the money you gave him, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally. Money is of very little value to a dead man.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston had gone very pale. There was dread in his eyes when he\r\nasked: \"And the real Commander Clement? What happened to him? Where is\r\nhe now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stockton told me that after a mask was made of his face he was\r\nimprisoned somewhere on the Station,\" Henley said. \"Clement and seven\r\nothers. Ramsey gave Hervet strict orders not to kill them. I don't\r\nknow where Clement is now, but I can make a pretty good guess. He has\r\nprobably been released and is in full command of the Station again.\"\r\n\r\nHenley stood very still for a moment, very straight and still, and\r\nCorriston could feel the gun nudging the small of his back again.\r\n\r\n\"I may as well tell you now that I'm going to have to lock you in,\r\nCorriston,\" Henley said. \"When I turn the key on this room your sole\r\nresponsibility will be right here with the controls. You'll have to\r\nsleep and eat here, and I don't intend to bring you any fancy meals.\r\nYou'll hear a knock on the door three times a day. You'll get a tray\r\nwith some food on it.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have to decide for yourself how much sleep you can afford to\r\ntake. And remember this: I'll be keeping a careful check on every\r\nnavigational move you make. Not a too accurate check, perhaps, but I'll\r\nknow enough. If you throw the ship off course I'll find out about it,\r\nand I'll want to know why. Be ready with your answers and make sure\r\nthey carry weight. Any more questions, Corriston?\"\r\n\r\nCorriston shook his head. \"No. The quicker you get out of here the\r\nbetter I'll feel.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, I'll leave you now. It's naturally to my benefit to try to\r\nsee things from your point of view. And just in case you're worrying\r\nabout Helen Ramsey--don't. Nothing is going to happen to her, provided\r\nyou stay in line. If you want me don't hesitate to buzz. That's what\r\nthe intercom is for.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston looked around once when Henley was on his way to the door.\r\nThe man hadn't turned away from him. He was backing toward the door,\r\nhis lips tight, his eyes mocking, coldly derisive.\r\n\r\n\"Did you think I'd give you a chance to catch me with my guard down,\r\nCorriston? If you did, you're a bigger fool than I thought you. This\r\ngun stays with me, and it's going to be centered on you every time I\r\nopen this door. Remember that, Lieutenant.\"\r\n\r\nThe journey to Mars was a long wait. It was a standing and a waiting,\r\nwith a hundred corrective power maneuvers to be checked at every hour\r\nof the day and night. It was sleep without rest and rest without sleep,\r\nand it was a battle against dizziness and the despair which can come to\r\na pilot when a panel starts flickering a red danger signal in the utter\r\nloneliness of interplanetary space.\r\n\r\nThe ship was never too hot, never too cold, for the temperature was\r\nkept stable by thermostat-controlled radiation shutters and the air\r\nwas kept pure with the aid of carbon filters. But to Corriston the air\r\nconditioning system with all of its elaborate controls seemed only to\r\npoint up and emphasize the lack of stability elsewhere, both inside and\r\noutside the ship.\r\n\r\nThere were so many things that could go wrong--tragically, dangerously,\r\nfatally wrong. For no reason at all, for instance, a recently inspected\r\nfilter or gasket could go completely bad, and a \"no juice\" blow up\r\nthreaten. Or a magnetic guidance tape could jam and stop recording, and\r\nthe ship could deviate a hair's breadth from its prescribed path and\r\nforget to swing completely back again.\r\n\r\nEventually a correction might be made, but if you failed to correct it\r\nin time, that one tiny deviation could spell disaster. With every day\r\nout there were more details to check, while obstacles mounted and it\r\nwas impossible ever to quite catch up with what you had to do, and go\r\non with complete confidence to the next task.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, Corriston was denied all opportunity to see or speak to\r\nthe woman he loved.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe trip to Mars took fourteen days. And in all that time Corriston\r\ndid not once see Helen Ramsey. He saw only Henley, heard only the deep\r\ndrone of the engines, and at times, when he was close to despair, the\r\ndull, steady beating of his own heart.\r\n\r\nThe door to his prison would open and a tray of food would be pushed\r\nforward into the compartment. Then the door would close quietly again,\r\nand he would be alone.\r\n\r\nIn some respects he was imprisoned in a way that was almost too\r\nunbelievable for the human mind to grasp. The walls of his cell were\r\nthe constellations, the barriers to his freedom space itself.\r\n\r\nThe chartroom was a cell too, but it had no real confining power over\r\nhim. He could walk out of the chart room simply by unlocking the\r\nviewport and swinging it wide open. He could walk out into the larger\r\nprison of space--and die in five seconds with his lungs on fire.\r\n\r\nOn the thirteenth day Mars loomed out of the inscrutable darkness ahead\r\nlike some great accusing eye that had fastened itself on the ship with\r\na malignance all its own. It filled one-fifth of the viewport, rust-red\r\nover most of its surface, but also pale blue in patches, a blue which\r\nshaded off into a kaleidoscope of colors that seemed to hover chiefly\r\nlike the shifting, almost hueless cloudiness of a hot summer haze.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the fifteenth day, the ship, decelerating under\r\nsidethrusts from its powerful retardation rockets, cut off its engines\r\nand, free-coasting through a landing ellipse of seventy degrees, landed\r\nsafely on Mars.\r\n\r\nIt landed in the open desert, twenty miles from Ramsey's citadel,\r\nand eighty-seven miles from the first Martian colony. But Corriston\r\nreceived no praise at all for his navigational skill.\r\n\r\nFive minutes after the engines ceased to throb a blow on the head\r\nfelled him, a brutal blow from behind.\r\n\r\n\"Tie him up,\" Henley said. \"We're not killing him, not just yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see why--\" a cold voice started to protest.\r\n\r\n\"Damn you, Stone, I know what I'm doing. Keep your thoughts to\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n15\r\n\r\n\r\nCorriston sat very straight and still in the darkness, his back against\r\ncold metal, his eyes on the distant glow of the heating lamp. He could\r\nsee the lamp through a wide panel opening in the bulkhead directly\r\nopposite him. Wherever his eyes fell there was the glimmer of light on\r\nmetal. But the warmth of the lamp would have left him close to freezing\r\nhad it not been supplemented by the heating units inside his heavy\r\nclothing.\r\n\r\nHe didn't know how he was going to free himself. His hands were\r\nsecurely handcuffed and the sharp metal was biting into his flesh.\r\nTurning and twisting about did him no good at all.\r\n\r\nHe didn't know how he was going to free himself, but he refused to give\r\nup hope. There had to be a way.\r\n\r\nYou could begin on one of your captors, on a human being with a great\r\ndeal to lose or gain. You could try to penetrate his armor, sound out\r\nhis human weaknesses. Or you could set to work on the handcuffs at your\r\nwrists, struggling in an almost hopeless attempt to draw your hands\r\nthrough them in some way or get them unlocked without a key.\r\n\r\nHe decided to try the first way. He raised his voice. \"Stone?\" he\r\ncalled out. \"Can you hear me?\"\r\n\r\nThere ensued a silence. Then Stone's voice came back loud and clear.\r\n\"Sure, I can hear you. What do you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd like to talk to you,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\n\"About what?\"\r\n\r\n\"About you. What are you getting out of this? You've nothing to lose by\r\nbeing frank with me. Henley would never believe anything I might say.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're right about that,\" Stone said. \"But why should I talk to you?\r\nI'll tell you something that may surprise you. Keeping you alive was\r\nHenley's idea. He figured we might need you. He figured that if Ramsey\r\nwouldn't listen to us he might listen to you--a Space Station officer.\r\nHe figured we might need you to convince Ramsey we're not bluffing.\r\nSomeone who _knows_ we're not bluffing. Someone who knows we'd kill his\r\ndaughter before we gave him a third chance to make up his mind and hand\r\nover the dough.\"\r\n\r\n\"A _third_ chance? I thought--\"\r\n\r\n\"You think too much, Corriston. I'll spell it out for you. Henley is on\r\nhis way now to give Ramsey his first chance. He may succeed or he may\r\nnot. If he doesn't succeed he'll come back and take you to the fortress\r\nwith him. That will be Ramsey's second chance. He won't get a third.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" Corriston said. \"But I asked you a question you didn't answer.\r\nHow much do you stand to get out of this? What is your split, your\r\npercentage? Don't tell me; I'll guess. Henley is promising you fifteen\r\nor twenty thousand dollars. But how much ransom do you think he'll get\r\nfrom Ramsey? Two million, at least. Possibly twenty million. Does that\r\nkind of split satisfy you, Stone? Remember, when that ransom is paid,\r\nevery law enforcement agency on Earth goes into operation. It starts\r\noff in a quiet suite of offices, with just one owl-faced little guy\r\nshuffling some papers.\r\n\r\n\"It starts off that way, but in the space of one hour you're a man\r\nmarked for destruction. The military goes into action. From Earth\r\nto Mars your photograph is televised. Ten thousand trained experts\r\nare thrown into the operation. You've suddenly become important, an\r\naccessory to the kidnapping of the wealthiest girl on Earth.\r\n\r\n\"How does that set with you, Stone? They'll get you in the end. No,\r\nI'll qualify that. They'll get you unless Ramsey gives you a split of\r\nat least a million dollars. With a million dollars you'd have a one in\r\nfive chance of covering your tracks, of hiding out indefinitely. But\r\nRamsey won't give you anything like that kind of a split. You know that\r\nas well as I do. He'll have to cover his own tracks and he'll need all\r\nof the two million--or twenty million--for himself. Or most of it.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not telling you anything you don't know. Your real interest lies\r\nin preventing that kidnapping before it's too late. He's getting ready\r\nto double-cross you, Stone. It was in the back of his mind all the\r\ntime. He's looking out only for himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" Stone said. \"My split, since you brought the matter\r\nup, is half a million. He's demanding six million in ransom. That's\r\ntwelve times what I'm getting and what Jim Saddler is getting. But I've\r\nno complaints. He organized and planned everything.\r\n\r\n\"I'll be honest with you. That doesn't mean a damn thing to me. I'm no\r\ngood when it comes to taking a risk like that, but does that mean he's\r\nbetter than I am? Do you think I'd string along with him if I believed\r\nthat for a moment?\r\n\r\n\"Hell, no. I'm using him, don't you see? I'm letting him take the big\r\ngamble, and I stay in the background ... doing practically nothing. So\r\nif I clear a half million, what have I to complain about?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing, I suppose,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\n\"You're damned right. But I don't think I like the way you said that.\r\nThere's something in your voice that I don't like.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's too bad,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe you think I don't mean what I said. Is that it?\"\r\n\r\nCorriston tightened his lips. He could hear Stone's footsteps coming\r\ntoward him through the darkness. They were heavy steps, advancing\r\nslowly, with a slight shuffling sound. They paused twice and then came\r\non again, and the silence between pauses seemed almost crushingly thick.\r\n\r\nCorriston suddenly realized that he knew almost nothing about Stone.\r\nHe had taken the man pretty much for granted, a killer's accomplice\r\nwithout much personality, a sullen-faced scoundrel who was good at\r\nobeying orders and standing ready to silence anyone Henley disliked\r\nwith a well-placed kick in the head.\r\n\r\nBut what if he did have personality after all? Suppose there were\r\nhidden depths in him, a hidden reservoir of malice which he kept\r\nconcealed until he felt a mad impulse to start laughing or bragging or\r\nproving to someone he disliked that he was as potentially dangerous as\r\nHenley--perhaps even more dangerous. And suppose he decided to back\r\nup his boasting with a quick knife thrust or a gun blast at almost\r\npoint-blank range?\r\n\r\nIt wasn't a pleasant thought, and the flicker of a match between\r\nStone's cupped hands did nothing to dispel Corriston's uneasiness. The\r\nsmall, bright flame brought Stone's features into sharp relief for an\r\ninstant. The lips had an ugly set to them, and the eyes were slitted,\r\ngleaming. He was making no effort to keep his hate from showing, and\r\nthe instant the match went out he lit another.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be advancing slowly on purpose, as if aware that his\r\nstealth and deliberation had begun to un-nerve Corriston. Corriston\r\nfelt himself stiffening, moving more closely back against the wall.\r\nBreathing quickly, he told himself that he hadn't much time, that he\r\nmust be careful not to overreach himself.\r\n\r\nThere was another moment of silence, of stillness, while the shuffling\r\nceased. Then Stone was very close in the darkness, his hands cupped\r\nabout a third match, a mocking smile on his lips.\r\n\r\nIt was a blunder on his part. Before he could move again Corriston was\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nThere are times when a handcuffed man is at a disadvantage in a\r\nfuriously waged and uncertain struggle, but Corriston suffered no\r\ndisadvantage. For ten minutes he had been reminding himself that a blow\r\nalong the side of the neck, just under the jaw, could paralyze and even\r\nkill if it were delivered with sufficient force.\r\n\r\nA sharp, flat-of-the-hand blow could do it. But handcuffs were better,\r\nand Corriston lashed out now with his manacled wrists upraised, so\r\nthat the handcuffs grazed Stone's neck twice lightly and then almost\r\nsplintered his jawbone with a rotor-blade violence.\r\n\r\nThe blow not only stunned Stone, it lifted him clear of the deck. He\r\nstaggered forward and fell heavily, his breath leaving his lungs in an\r\nagonizing sob.\r\n\r\nCorriston leaned back against the wall again for an instant, breathing\r\nheavily. Then he knelt beside Stone and went through his pockets\r\nuntil he found the handcuff key. It was difficult. He had to do a lot\r\nof awkward fumbling with his fingers, and even with the key in his\r\npossession, getting the cuffs off was far from easy. But somehow he\r\nmanaged it, perhaps because he had unusually flexible fingers and knew\r\nthat if he failed, Stone would see to it that he got no second chance\r\nthis side of eternity.\r\n\r\nHe stood very straight and still in the darkness, his eyes focused on\r\nStone's white face. There was no need for him to strike a match. He had\r\ntaken from Stone not only the key, but a small pocket flashlight which\r\nStone had apparently preferred not to use.\r\n\r\nThere was something else he had taken from Stone--his gun. He held the\r\nweapon now, very firmly centered on Stone, while he waited for him to\r\ncome to.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily he wouldn't have cared if Stone had never opened his\r\neyes again; but now he had to wait and see. The ship was so large\r\nthat to explore it compartment by compartment until he found the one\r\nin which Helen Ramsey was being held prisoner would be dangerously\r\ntime-consuming. So, if Stone recovered consciousness within fifteen or\r\ntwenty minutes and could tell him, so much the better.\r\n\r\nIf not, better wait and see. He waited, shifting his gun only a little\r\nfrom weariness as the minutes dragged on, wondering if he had not made\r\na mistake in waiting at all.\r\n\r\nFinally Stone stirred and groaned. Corriston bent and shook him by the\r\nshoulders. He took firm hold of his shoulders and shook him vigorously,\r\nfeeling no pity for him at all.\r\n\r\nHe got the truth out of him by threatening him with violence, by\r\nthreatening to kill him if he kept anything back. Stone kept nothing\r\nback. Just remembering the blow that had felled him, loosened his\r\ntongue. But the gun helped too, the gun wedged so closely against his\r\nribs under his heart that he feared that if he breathed too heavily he\r\nwould breathe his last.\r\n\r\n\"I won't lie to you,\" he said desperately, pleadingly. \"You haven't a\r\nchance. There's a photoelectric alarm system outside the compartment,\r\nand Jim Saddler is sitting just inside the door. He has a gun trained\r\non her. His orders are to shoot her dead if anyone so much as attempts\r\nto get inside that door.\"\r\n\r\n\"Meaning me?\"\r\n\r\n\"It means you, Lieutenant. I'm not lying; I swear it. You won't stand a\r\nchance. Henley will be coming back in a few hours now. You'd better get\r\nout while you're still in one piece.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston was tempted to hurl Stone back against the wall and shout at\r\nhim: \"It doesn't matter whether I go out of here in one piece or dead\r\non a stretcher. She's the only thing I care about.\"\r\n\r\nBut he caught himself just in time. Stone thought in the most\r\nprimitive imaginable terms. You couldn't go to a Stone Age man and say:\r\n\"My own skin doesn't mean a goddam thing to me. I'm in love. If she\r\ndies I die. Can't you understand that? If she dies, my life will be\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\nHe said instead: \"All right. I guess it means I've got to get help.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll never get help,\" Stone said, summoning from some defiant depths\r\nwithin himself a little courage. \"The colony is eighty-seven miles from\r\nhere. You couldn't cross the desert on foot. No one could cross it on\r\nfoot, not when the temperature drops at night to fifty below. But you'd\r\nbetter not stay. He'd better head for Ramsey's citadel. That's your\r\nonly chance. It's only twenty miles from here.\"\r\n\r\n_Let him think that_, a voice within Corriston warned. Let him think\r\nthat I'll head for the citadel. Otherwise he may attempt to get word to\r\nRamsey somehow. I can tie him up and leave him in a state of shock, but\r\nif he thinks I'm heading for the colony, even a state of shock may not\r\nstop him. Saddler may come down here looking for him. Once he's freed,\r\nif he thinks I'm heading for the Colony....\r\n\r\nCorriston said: \"Damn you, Stone, I ought to kill you. I ought to put a\r\nbullet through your heart right now. I don't know why I can't. It's a\r\nweakness in me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'd kill _you_, Corriston, if _I_ had the chance. But I'm glad you\r\nhave that kind of a weakness.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston stared at him incredulously. \"You're certainly outspoken. You\r\nwere pleading for your life a moment ago--going soft, as you'd put it.\r\nNow you're talking realistically, analyzing your own motivations and\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not quite as dumb as you think me, Corriston.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Let's say you're not dumb. Few people are, when it comes to\r\na matter of life or death. That's beside the point right now. I've got\r\nto tie you up. Where can I find some rope?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be much simpler to lock me in a vacant compartment.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. Then I'll lock you in one of the compartments. You can\r\npick your own compartment. I'd advise you not to waste my time. Pick\r\nyour own compartment and I'll slide the bolt fast on the outside.\"\r\n\r\nStone showed no disposition to put up an argument. Corriston kept the\r\ngun pressed into the small of his back and he seemed to realize that\r\nhis life hung by a thread.\r\n\r\nThey found a compartment that was small and dark, and into it Stone\r\nwalked at gunpoint, offering no protest, and answering the questions\r\nCorriston put to him readily enough.\r\n\r\n\"You'll find all the equipment you need at the end of this passageway,\"\r\nStone said. \"Activate the third door on your left. Anything else you'd\r\nlike to know?\"\r\n\r\nCorriston shook his head. He walked out of the compartment backwards,\r\nkeeping his gun trained on Stone until he was in the corridor. Then he\r\nswung the door shut and shot the bolt home.\r\n\r\nHe had no trouble at all in finding the equipment he knew he'd need,\r\nthanks to Stone's generosity. Stone could afford to be generous, he\r\nreflected bitterly. The Henley combine still held all of the trump\r\ncards.\r\n\r\nHe cursed the time it took him to equip himself for a near-suicidal\r\ncrossing of eighty-seven miles of Martian desert. He would travel on\r\nfoot, after nightfall, and in freezing cold. The compartment in which\r\nhe labored was a basal compartment, and set in the massive bulkhead,\r\nagainst which he leaned with his bootstraps still unlaced, was an\r\nairlock opening directly on the Martian plain.\r\n\r\nHe collected the smaller articles first, setting them down in a row on\r\na long metal bench directly opposite the airlock: three compasses, each\r\nweighing perhaps twenty ounces; a cathode ray compass; a non-magnetic\r\ncompass and a sun compass. The sun compass would perhaps prove the most\r\nvaluable until darkness fell. The sun, shining down with brilliance\r\nfrom the clear Martian sky, could throw a directional kind of shadow,\r\nenabling a man on foot to take fairly accurate bearings without the use\r\nof sighting and viewing instruments.\r\n\r\nTo the compasses on the bench he added five map coordinates and a\r\nLambert conformal projection chart.\r\n\r\nFood concentrates came next: four shining aluminum cubes, four inches\r\nby four inches, which would go into the knapsack on his back. Then a\r\ncanteen, already filled with sterilized water from the ship's central\r\nwater supply system.\r\n\r\nNext, he took from the locker the right kind of clothing: a tubeflex\r\ninner suit with a warm lining and a heavy outer suit equipped with heat\r\nlamps.\r\n\r\nOxygen masks next--oxy-respirators, to be exact. One to attach to the\r\nface and one to hold in reserve as a spare. They covered only a third\r\nof the face, but that third had everything to do with a man's staying\r\nalive and vigorous in the thin air of Mars. When night fell, and the\r\ncold descended, oxy-respirators were not enough. Then you had to pull\r\ndown the entire front of your helmet and stagger on with your sight\r\nimpaired, for in a cold that was almost beyond endurance, helmets had a\r\nway of clouding over from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe clouding over of the vision plate was not too important. It could\r\nbe constantly wiped clean. But if his brain started \"clouding over\"\r\ntoo....\r\n\r\nHe dismissed the possibility from his mind. He was clothed now, fully\r\nclothed, and ready to depart.\r\n\r\nHe started moving toward the airlock, feeling and looking like a giant\r\nbeetle of the tropics, feeling awkward, cumbersome and insecure. His\r\nboots were weighted, and the bulge of the oxygen tank on his shoulder\r\nmade him look almost hunchbacked in the cold light glimmer that turned\r\nthe bulkhead into a mirroring surface as he advanced.\r\n\r\nHe manipulated the airlock and it opened with a slow, steady droning\r\nand then he was passing through it, still moving awkwardly....\r\n\r\nAt last! He was out on the Martian desert in bright sunlight, staring\r\nup at the clear blue sky.\r\n\r\nThe first few miles were not difficult at all. He walked away from\r\nthe ship with his shoulders held straight, the cumbersome feeling\r\ndissipated by the lightness of his stride in the incredibly light\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nThe air pressure about him was less than seventy millimeters of\r\nmercury. The thought sprouted in his mind that he was the god Mercury\r\nstriding along with winged shoes, and for the first five miles his\r\nweighted boots did seem to develop wings.\r\n\r\nThen the temperature began slowly to drop. The sun sank lower. Its\r\nbrightness diminished, and his cheeks began to tingle with the cold.\r\n\r\nThere was a slight wind blowing over the desert, raising dust flurries\r\non the summits of the tallest dunes, causing the gray patches of crust\r\nlichen, which were scattered widely over the plain, to change color as\r\ntheir threadlike surfaces were ruffled by the breeze.\r\n\r\nFar in the distance he could see a \"canal,\" one of those strange\r\nblue-green declivities in the terrain which looked from the air like an\r\nactual waterway, and had deceived--or bewildered--three generations of\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nDespite the increasing cold, Corriston did not moderate his stride.\r\nHe let his thoughts dwell on the most imaginative of the canal\r\nspeculations. It had been proven completely false, but its originality\r\nfascinated him. Long ago, the theory held, there had been volcanic\r\nactivity on Mars. Great faults or fissures had opened up in the\r\nplanet's crust, and when the coming of spring thawed the polar ice\r\ncaps, curtains of fog swirled equatorward, filling those natural\r\ncrevices with swirling rivers of mist.\r\n\r\nCorriston stopped walking for a moment, shifting the weight of his\r\nequipment slightly, easing a too heavy drag on his right shoulder. He\r\nmade sure that the thin flexible tube which connected his oxygen mask\r\nwith the small tank on his back was securely clipped into place at both\r\nends, tested the harness buckle which supported supplies which were as\r\nnecessary to him as breathing, and took a turn up and down the sand,\r\nstamping, shaking himself, to make absolutely certain that nothing\r\nvital had been jarred loose.\r\n\r\nThen he was under way again, moving along at a steady pace over the\r\nrust-red desert, the ship now lost to view far behind him, his mind\r\nleaping ahead to the very great dangers which he was determined to face\r\nand overcome so long as one slender thread of hope remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n16\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might have been almost any sleepy little town on Earth, picked at\r\nrandom from a train window--a dust bowl town with a prairie name:\r\nHawk's Valley, Buzzard's Gulch, and the like. It might have been, but\r\nit wasn't.\r\n\r\nThe buildings were thinner, of more precarious construction, and each\r\nhad been built to house three or more families. They were at unusual\r\nangles on sloping ledges where the soil was firm enough to resist\r\novernight erosion from winds of hurricane force, and in many places\r\ntheir prefabricated metal foundations were pierced and supported by\r\nshafts of solid rock.\r\n\r\nWithout modern technology at its most advanced, the town could never\r\nhave been built. Yet in the streets of the town there was a village\r\nrudeness of construction which no pioneering effort could quite efface:\r\na wide main street that gleamed red in the sunlight on which three\r\ncaterpillar tractors stood stalled, their guard rails caked with\r\nyellow mud; a pool of stagnant black water with a wooden plank thrown\r\nhaphazardly across it; a discarded fuel container upended against a\r\nhalf-rusted away metal cable, and the remnants of an hydraulic actuator\r\novergrown with hardy lichens that had colored it yellow and ash gray.\r\nAnd here and there, projecting from the tumbled sand, were spiny\r\ncactus-like growths.\r\n\r\nYet it was not too small a town. Its inhabitants numbered eight\r\nthousand, two-thirds of them men. There were ninety-seven children. It\r\nwas not too small a town, and now, in each of the houses, a new day was\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nAt least thirty men and a few women had collected about the\r\nhaggard-eyed desert straggler. Every one of them hung on his words.\r\nEvery one of these people had been ruined by Ramsey's rapacious\r\ngreed. Their past accomplishments were destroyed; their futures were\r\nnon-existent. They lived in a terrorized state, from hand-to-mouth,\r\nindifferent now to any more wrongdoing that could be visited upon them.\r\nThe fires of their hatred for Ramsey gave them the basic energy to go\r\non existing.\r\n\r\nOut of grinding desperation they had turned to Henley, had given him\r\na free hand, even when most, in their heart-of-hearts, knew he was a\r\nscoundrel. The fact was that he was the only man among them not so\r\ncowed as to be actively enraged against Ramsey. He promised that the\r\nmines would be given back to the people. And, having nothing, they\r\nbelieved everything.\r\n\r\nThey came from everywhere in the colony, and from every trade and\r\nprofession. Who was this man? And was he friend or foe?\r\n\r\nThe crowd grew slowly. Despite the shouts and the sudden stir of\r\nexcitement which had greeted the speaker on his arrival, there was\r\nno headlong rush to surround him. The colonists emerged from their\r\nlodgings and converged calmly upon the square, some having the look\r\nof tradesfolk concerned with a possible interruption of business, and\r\nothers seemingly intent only on what the stranger might have to say.\r\n\r\nIt was unusually warm for so early an hour, the temperature well up\r\nin the mid-forties, and there was no need for the heat-generating\r\ninner garments, only for oxygen masks and heavy outdoor clothing and\r\nthe careful avoidance of too much muscular exertion in the absence of\r\nweighted shoes.\r\n\r\nThis is madness, Corriston told himself. I am in no condition to\r\nconvince these people, to make them understand. I should have rested\r\nfirst. Three hours' sleep would have helped. I should have asked for\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nCorriston felt suddenly tongue-tied. Words were failing him when he\r\nneeded them most. His speech became halting and confused. He had been\r\ntalking for twenty minutes--twenty minutes at least--but suddenly he\r\nwas quite sure that he hadn't succeeded in convincing anyone that he\r\nwas speaking only the simple truth.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the faces before him a little more intently and saw what\r\nhe had not noticed before: everyone was waiting for him to go on;\r\neveryone seemed to be hanging on his words.\r\n\r\nHad he misjudged them after all? Or had he misjudged his own capacity\r\nto be persuasive, to talk with conviction when his very life hung in\r\nthe balance?\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt on that score. His life did hang in the\r\nbalance. They'd make short shift of him if they thought he was on\r\nRamsey's side.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't Ramsey I'm concerned about,\" he heard himself saying. \"I'm\r\npleading with you to face up to the truth about yourselves. You trusted\r\nHenley because you were desperate. You couldn't put your trust in a\r\nweak or indecisive man. You needed a tool with a cutting edge. That I\r\ncan understand. But you picked the wrong man. Henley doesn't want to\r\nsee justice done. He doesn't want to help you at all. He wants to help\r\nhimself at your expense, to help himself in a vicious, brutal way.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's a lie,\" someone in the crowd said. \"Henley's a good man.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston freed himself from his dust-caked coat. He shrugged it off\r\nand let it drop to the sand. Then he straightened his oxygen mask and\r\nwent on: \"It's not a lie. It's the simple truth.\"\r\n\r\nHe wondered why he had shrugged off his warmest garment. It was cold,\r\nhe was shivering, and it had been a ridiculous thing to do. Had he\r\nintended it as a challenge? In a crazy, confused, subconscious way, was\r\nhe offering to fight anyone who disagreed with him.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly realized that he was a little drunk. Not on alcohol, but on\r\na slight excess of oxygen. He fingered the gauge on his mask, cutting\r\ndown the tank inflow, cursing himself for his delay in doing so.\r\n\r\nHad he convinced anyone? He looked at the faces about him and was\r\nastonished by their impassivity. Few of the men or women before him\r\nseemed either angry or disturbed. They just seemed to be quietly\r\nlistening.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he realized that he was completely in error. They were\r\nconvinced, persuaded, almost completely on his side. Their silence was\r\nin itself revealing, just as the hush which precedes an avalanche can\r\nbe convincing, or the stillness which precedes a storm at sea.\r\n\r\nThey were waiting for him to go on.\r\n\r\nHe talked for thirty more minutes and then there was a long silence,\r\npunctuated only by the harsh breathing of a few men who seemed to\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n17\r\n\r\n\r\nCorriston knew that the few who disagreed were prepared to make\r\ntrouble, but he was not prepared for the violence which ensued.\r\n\r\nFights broke out in the crowd, singly and in groups. The colonists with\r\nstrong convictions took issue with the few who disagreed. And the few\r\nwho disagreed had strong convictions, too.\r\n\r\nTwo men about the same in height were suddenly down on the ground\r\nraining fisticuffs at each other.\r\n\r\n\"Damn you, Reeves, I'll break your jaw. From the first minute I saw\r\nHenley I knew he was a scoundrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, and who else but a scoundrel could hold his own with a rat like\r\nRamsey. We can call the turn on him if he goes too far.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an explosion of cursing and Corriston could see five more men\r\nfighting, moving backwards as they exchanged blows toward the periphery\r\nof the crowd.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing he could do to stop the fighting. He was close to\r\nexhaustion, hardly able to stand. He desperately needed food and\r\nrest--a long rest flat on his back.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he realized that he had victory within his grasp. Most things\r\nworthwhile in life called for a decisive effort of will. He decided\r\nsuddenly that he couldn't just let the fighting go on. He had to take\r\na firm stand himself, had to convince everyone that he was prepared to\r\nfight for his convictions.\r\n\r\nHe moved forward into the crowd. He grabbed one doubter by the\r\nshoulder, held fast to him for an instant, and then sent his fist\r\ncrashing into the astonished man's jaw.\r\n\r\nThe doubter folded in complete silence. Corriston stepped back from\r\nhim and said in a voice loud enough to carry to the rim of the crowd:\r\n\"I don't care how many of you I have to take on. Every word I've said\r\nis the truth. If you can only settle it by killing me, you may as well\r\nstart trying.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence then. Even the sound of the breeze rustling the\r\ngarments of the colonists, stirring little flurries of sand along the\r\nmain street, seemed to become muted. Far off between the houses a clock\r\nstruck the time. It seemed very loud in the stillness.\r\n\r\nIt amazed Corriston a little, even in his exhausted state, how\r\ndeterminedly a challenge like that could be accepted at face value.\r\nHe was quite sure that he had won a victory; that nine-tenths of the\r\ncolonists were on his side. But everyone remained silent, everyone drew\r\nback in tight-lipped silence while the issue was put to the test.\r\n\r\nA tall man with a lean, lantern-jawed face approached Corriston and\r\nsaid: \"I'm going to tell you exactly what I think. Henley isn't an easy\r\nman to understand. He keeps his thoughts to himself and he may have\r\nhad his own special reasons for pulling the wool over your eyes. He's\r\nlooking out for our best interests; I'm sure of that. But what good\r\nwould it do me to knock you down to prove it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No good at all,\" Corriston said. \"But try knocking me down if you want\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not going to try,\" the lantern-jawed man said. \"I think you're\r\nlying. That's all I have to say.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston watched him disappear in the crowd and shook his head. He\r\nfelt like a man with a fly swatter in his hand. He had won a victory\r\nand yet if he failed to swat a few flies no one would believe that he\r\nwas telling the truth.\r\n\r\nFinally he got his chance. A thickset, dark-browed man with a\r\ntrouble-seeking aspect came up and hurled insults at him in a markedly\r\noffensive way.\r\n\r\nCorriston hit him three times. The first blow doubled him up, the\r\nsecond dropped him to his knees; the third flattened him out on the\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nCorriston stepped back and surveyed the crowd. Their response now was\r\noverwhelmingly favorable.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't a complete victory. There were still doubters, still\r\narguments going on, still a hatred for Ramsey that overflowed and made\r\na mockery of the few voices raised in his defense.\r\n\r\nAnd Corriston was glad that not too many voices were raised in Ramsey's\r\ndefense. He had not come to plead Ramsey's cause, and he wanted all of\r\nthe colonists to know that. He only asked that a truce be declared, an\r\nend to the fierce, immediate hatreds, while a scoundrel was attacked by\r\nmen who had been lied to, cheated and betrayed. He moved still further\r\nforward into the crowd, prepared to fight again if he had to, prepared\r\nto back up his arguments with the simple, primitive and direct use of\r\nhis fists.\r\n\r\nHe swayed suddenly and realized that he was at the end of his\r\nendurance, and now would in all probability make a complete fool of\r\nhimself. He would commit the unforgivable folly of issuing a challenge\r\nthat he couldn't back up.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head violently, trying to clear it, but his dizziness\r\nincreased. The landscape about him began to pinwheel and he saw the\r\nstreets of the colony through a wavering yellow mist. The store fronts\r\ndanced, the rusting and discarded machinery on a side street began to\r\nmove and come to life, to clatter and waltz about.\r\n\r\nA woman moving toward him seemed to grow in height, her oxygen mask\r\nwidening out, overspreading her face. For a moment she seemed like an\r\nimpossible ballet figure in a _danse macabre_, pivoting about on her\r\ntoes as a caterpillar tractor came rushing toward her through the thin\r\nair of Mars.\r\n\r\nThen two colonists were supporting him, holding him tightly by the\r\nelbows, refusing to let him collapse. It was outrageous, because he\r\n_wanted_ to collapse. He wanted to sink down, to let sleep wash over\r\nhim, to forget all of his troubles in merciful oblivion.\r\n\r\nBut the two colonists were very stubborn. They refused to let him\r\ncollapse. He only wanted to go to sleep, to forget all of his troubles,\r\nbut the two colonists were like doctors in a hospital, very stern, very\r\npatient, and seemingly determined to keep him on his feet.\r\n\r\nSomehow they must have failed. They must have failed because when\r\nhe became fully conscious again he was lying between cool white\r\nsheets, and a woman in a white nurse's uniform was bending over him.\r\nBy straining his eyes he could see two men who looked like doctors\r\nstanding just beyond her.\r\n\r\nThe two men appeared to be discussing him, but when he struggled to\r\na sitting position and stared hard at them they came toward him with\r\nreassuring smiles, and one of them said: \"Take it easy, now. You're\r\ngoing to be all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I ... I must have passed out,\" he stammered. \"I was ready to pass out\r\nbefore I started talking. Is this a hospital? I guess it is. I should\r\nhave come here immediately. Forty hours in the desert and I arrive\r\nhalf-delirious and make a fool of myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy,\" one of the doctors said. \"You didn't make a fool of\r\nyourself. Quite the contrary.\"\r\n\r\nOh, brother, he thought. They're lying to me to spare me, or something.\r\n\"I have a vague recollection of not being able to stand, of talking my\r\nhead off and then collapsing and making a complete fool of myself, of\r\naccomplishing nothing at all. I swung hard at two or three people. I\r\nknocked one man down, flat on his back. But that was a crazy thing to\r\ndo. It's no way to win the confidence or respect of anyone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look,\" one of the doctors said, taking firm hold of his shoulder\r\nand shaking him gently. \"Don't go reproaching yourself. You've got\r\nnine-tenths of the colony behind you.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, you convinced almost everyone. And that was a miracle in itself,\r\nconsidering how close to collapse you were. You were running a high\r\nfever. You were dehydrated. Your skin was as dry as a parched lichen.\r\nYet you stood there and convinced them. That's the gospel truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"They've chosen you as their leader,\" the second doctor said. \"They're\r\ngoing after Henley before it's too late. They feel exactly as you\r\ndo about Ramsey's daughter. Not about Ramsey perhaps--but about the\r\nkidnapping of a helpless girl. None of them have any liking for Henley\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18\r\n\r\n\r\nCorriston walked out into the central square and stood there. For a\r\nmoment no one said a word. One of the doctors was there with him. He'd\r\nhad a sandwich and coffee before leaving the hospital and his nerves\r\nfelt steady and his voice was pitched low.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know a single one of these men, Dr. Tomlinson,\" he said. \"I\r\nspent a week in the colony four years ago, but I just don't see anyone\r\nI recognize. I'm afraid you'll have to introduce me around.\"\r\n\r\nIt took a full hour to really get acquainted, to plan what had to\r\nbe done, to check over the tractors, the ammunition supplies, the\r\nequipment of each and every man.\r\n\r\nThey had to cross eighty-seven miles of desert to a heavily guarded\r\ncave and then move on perhaps to Ramsey's fortress. They had to be\r\nprepared for any eventuality.\r\n\r\nThe morale was good. Corriston could sense the grim determination in\r\nevery man, the faith in their mission, the anger. It cheered him.\r\n\r\nHe walked around between the tractors, listening to stray bits of talk,\r\ngetting better acquainted with everyone as the minutes sped by.\r\n\r\nHe took out his watch and looked at it and decided that time was\r\nrunning short.\r\n\r\nGive each and every man twenty minutes, he thought. Then we get\r\nrolling. Thirty caterpillar tractors and two hundred and ten men. And\r\nin the ship are two men holed up--possibly three now--with all the\r\nportable fighting equipment of a two thousand ton spaceship at their\r\ndisposal. And if Henley has returned--\r\n\r\nSuddenly Corriston found himself sweating in the silence, despite the\r\ncold, despite the hoar frost that was beginning to collect on the rim\r\nof his oxygen mask. There was a split second of shouting from one of\r\nthe tractors and then it started up, with a coughing and spitting that\r\ndrowned out the human voices.\r\n\r\nAll along the wide, rust-red street other tractors came to life. In the\r\nthin air of Mars, in the pale sky, a single blue cloud hung suspended.\r\n\r\nIt was wispy thin, incredibly thin, a hollow mockery of a cloud. But\r\nthe scene below would have been less remarkable had the sky remained\r\ncloudless, for then Mars would have seemed completely unlike Earth and\r\nthe human drama less compelling.\r\n\r\nThere was something tremendous in the forward march of the tractors,\r\nin the clatter and the rising dust, the shouts of the men at the\r\ncontrols and the women who ran swift-footed along the sand to urge them\r\nto greater fortitude. The women knew that endurance would be needed,\r\nfor twenty-first century weapons of warfare could destroy a hundred\r\ntractors and spatter the desert with blood before retaliation could\r\nbecome complete and justice be fully satisfied.\r\n\r\nSo the women did not weep or lament. They ran parallel with the\r\ntractors, urging their men onward, stifling their own inner fears in\r\nthe greatness of the moment.\r\n\r\nCorriston waited for the last tractor to come abreast of him before\r\nhe leapt aboard it. There was the smell of acrid grease in the air,\r\na smell of burning. The mechanical parts set up a dull rumbling, and\r\nas Corriston swung himself aboard, a voice said: \"I'm Stanley Gregor.\r\nIf I had any sense I wouldn't take part in this. I came to Mars with\r\nthe second expedition. I'm sixty-two years old but somehow today I\r\nfeel young. There's no longer any doubt in my mind that Henley is a\r\nscoundrel. Why we trusted him I don't know. I'm here to do my part in\r\nrectifying an error.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure,\" Corriston said, settling down at the side of a big,\r\nawkward-looking man with red hair. \"Sure, I understand. Take it easy.\r\nWe're all in this together.\"\r\n\r\n\"We've got eighty-seven miles of desert to cross. It's going to be\r\ntough. Have you seen the fortress Ramsey built to protect himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\n\"There are twenty-five square miles of fortified\r\ndefenses--photoelectric eye installations. They spot you when you're\r\na half-mile away. Try to storm those installations even with a dozen\r\narmed tractors, and you'll be pulverized into dust. Try to storm them\r\non foot with the most formidable of energy weapons, and you'll be\r\nelectrocuted. You'll hang suspended on barbed wire. Think that over,\r\nLieutenant.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've thought it over,\" Corriston said. \"We won't have to storm the\r\nfortress unless they've taken Ramsey's daughter there, or if Ramsey\r\nhimself is in danger. And if he is in danger, he'll welcome our help.\r\nWe're going to the ship first and there are only two men on the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they've got plenty of ammunition, haven't they? They've got the\r\nship's military installations. Anyway you slice it, it's a dangerous\r\ngamble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I never thought it was anything else,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n19\r\n\r\n\r\nCorriston woke up to the hum of human voices, the soft whisper of the\r\nwind, the gentle stirring of sand. He awoke to coldness and brightness,\r\nto sunlight that dazzled him with its brightness.\r\n\r\nCorriston remembered then. Not everything at once, but just the first\r\nthing. There were no guideposts. That was always the first thing to\r\nremember when you woke up from a brief, twenty-minute sleep on Mars.\r\n\r\nIn islands scoured by trade winds and bright with blown sea spray a man\r\ndoes not talk of traveling east or west, and even familiar streets are\r\nno longer given names or marked by intersections. A man talks instead\r\nof walking into the wind, of setting his course by the north star,\r\nof moving straight into the teeth of the gale or huddling for shelter\r\nbeneath a high chalk cliff where all directions converge in a hollow\r\ndrumming that has neither beginning nor end. It was that way on Mars.\r\nIt would always be that way, it could never change.\r\n\r\nJust lie very still and listen, listen to the voices of men who are\r\nrisking their lives to help you. Listen and be grateful; listen and be\r\nproud.\r\n\r\nAll at once Corriston realized that an amazing discussion was going on.\r\nThey were discussing an eleven-year-old boy who had done an absolutely\r\ncrazy thing. He had followed his father into the desert by concealing\r\nhimself in one of the tractors, behind a liquid-fuel cylinder, and was\r\nnow a member of the 210 man rescue team.\r\n\r\n\"Mars is no place for a kid. Dr. Drever ought to be ashamed of himself.\r\nIf a man has children--well, Mars is simply no place for children.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's right. A boy of eleven needs companions his own age to help\r\nhim over the growingpain hurdles. He needs a backyard to play in. When\r\nI was a kid I had a bike of my own, a bull terrier pup, a collection\r\nof butterflies, a stamp collection and a simply amazing talent for\r\nroughing up my clothes.\r\n\r\n\"Mars is the worst of all possible worlds for a kid like Freddy.\r\nWe're buoyed up by the bigness and the newness and the strangeness\r\nof everything. The mile-high granite cliffs don't really belong to a\r\nplanet smaller than Earth. But they're here and we accept them. We pit\r\nour technical brilliance--or lack of it--against the rugged grandeur of\r\nthe mountains and the plains and we can take even the sandstorms in our\r\nstride. But to bring a kid here--\"\r\n\r\n\"Drever is a widower. He quite naturally didn't want to put his son\r\nin an orphanage. Besides, there are thirteen other young kids in the\r\nColony.\"\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't excuse it. There are plenty of childless single men.\"\r\n\r\n\"How many of them could step into Drever's shoes and grow to his\r\nstature as the first really great medical specialist on Mars? You're\r\nforgetting the hell he had to go through just to pass the preliminary\r\nscreening. It's rugged for a man of his attainments. They not only\r\ninsist that he be good; they want him to be the best.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true enough, I suppose. And now that he's here he probably\r\ncouldn't be replaced. Experience of a very special sort does things for\r\na man. And _to_ a man, if you like.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm simply stressing that Mars is simply not a place for a kid of\r\nFreddy's age. When he goes roaming he gets his lungs choked with dust.\r\nHe couldn't ride a bike on Mars--if he had a bike. Worst of all, he has\r\nno kids of his own age to play with. And now he comes on a trip like\r\nthis. Does he hope to rescue the Ramsey girl all by himself?\"\r\n\r\nCorriston got up then. The three men who had been discussing Dr.\r\nDrever's son stood by the smoldering embers of a burnt out campfire.\r\nThey were kindly looking men but a certain narrow-mindedness was\r\nstamped on the faces of at least two of them.\r\n\r\nCorriston shrugged off his weariness and walked up to them. \"Nonsense!\"\r\nhe said.\r\n\r\nA startled look came into the eyes of the oldest, a grizzled scarecrow\r\nof a man whose beard descended almost to his waist. He was a Martian\r\ngeologist, and a good one.\r\n\r\n\"Eh, Lieutenant. I was just going to ask you. Shouldn't we get started?\"\r\n\r\n\"We should and we will,\" Corriston said. \"But a good many men collapsed\r\nfrom the cold this morning. If we don't arrive at that ship in force,\r\nwe may live to regret it. Where's Freddy? Have you seen him?\"\r\n\r\nThe grizzled man raised his arm and pointed: \"Over there,\" he said.\r\n\"His coming along was just about the craziest thing I ever heard of.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston walked across the churned up sand to where Freddy sat\r\nperched like a disconsolate gnome on a metal-rimmed food container\r\nshaped like an old-fashioned water barrel.\r\n\r\nDr. Drever's son was almost twelve, but he was small for his age and\r\nCorriston had seen boys of nine who were much huskier looking.\r\n\r\nCorriston had no way of knowing that on Earth, shoulder to shoulder\r\nwith other schoolboys, Freddy had never thought of himself as\r\nparticularly small. It was only on Mars, all alone with his father and\r\nother grownups, that he had felt even smaller than he actually was. He\r\nhad felt like a dwarf child.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you do it, Freddy?\" Corriston asked. \"Your father is very\r\nupset and worried.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy looked up quickly and just as quickly lowered his eyes again.\r\n\r\n\"I had to come,\" he said. \"I had to.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston stared at him for a long moment in silence. Then he said: \"I\r\nthink perhaps I understand, Freddy. Just suppose we say you succumbed\r\nto an impulse to roam. The exploring urge can be overwhelming in a\r\nboy of your age. It usually is. If you were on Earth right now you'd\r\nbe dreaming about exploring the headwaters of the Amazon. You'd be\r\ndreaming about birds with bright, tropical plumage and butterflies as\r\nbig as dinner plates.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy looked up again, not quite so quickly this time. There was\r\nwonder and admiration in his stare. \"How did you know?\" he gasped.\r\n\r\n\"I guess I was pretty much like you, Freddy--once,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\n\"Gee, thanks,\" Freddy said.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks for understanding me, Lieutenant Corriston.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston walked out between the tractors and raised his voice so that\r\neveryone within earshot could hear him.\r\n\r\n\"We're starting again in ten minutes,\" he said. \"Better have another\r\ncup of coffee all around.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sand had been blowing for forty minutes. It was a flying avalanche,\r\na flailing mace. Even inside the tractors it set up an almost\r\nintolerable roaring in the eardrums, and when it struck the wind-guards\r\nhead on the battered vehicles shook. For five or six seconds they would\r\nrumble on and then come to a jolting halt. Often they would start up\r\nagain almost immediately but equally often they would remain stalled\r\nfor several minutes, and at times there were more stalled tractors than\r\nmoving ones across the entire line of advance.\r\n\r\nThe pelting never ceased, never let up even for a moment. Minute after\r\nminute the sand came sweeping down in red fury, tons upon tons of\r\nit, in great circular waves from high overhead and in jet velocity\r\nflurries close to the ground. In that assault of billions upon billions\r\nof spinning particles the brightly colored lichens which covered the\r\nMartian plains were uprooted, lifted high in the air, and carried for\r\ndozens of miles, flying carpets so small they scarcely could have\r\nsupported the tiniest of elves.\r\n\r\nFor three hours the sandstorm continued to rage in fury, and then,\r\nabruptly, the wind died down, the last flurry subsided, and the\r\ncolonists got under way again. And just for a change a few of them\r\ndescended from the tractors and advanced on foot, keeping a little\r\nahead of the swaying vehicles.\r\n\r\nDr. Drever, a tall, stooped man with graying temples but surprisingly\r\nyouthful eyes accelerated his stride a little and fell in with the\r\nscarecrow geologist who was walking at Corriston's side.\r\n\r\n\"We can't be far from the ship now,\" he said. \"I wish there was some\r\nway I could send Freddy back. If I thought you could spare a tractor\r\nand one man to accompany him....\"\r\n\r\n\"Freddy will be all right,\" Corriston said. \"You don't know what it\r\nmeans to a kid like Freddy to ride through a sandstorm in the company\r\nof grownups. He had to prove something to himself, and I think he's\r\ndone it.\"\r\n\r\nThe stillness was almost unnatural now, and Corriston could see that\r\nmost of the men were becoming uneasy about it. The desert seemed too\r\nbright and far too quiet. It was one of those mysterious, brooding\r\nsilences that are a menace to start with. You think of unsuspected\r\npitfalls, hidden traps. Imagination leaps ahead of reality and leaves\r\nan insidious kind of demoralization in its wake.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not surprised that all the animal life on Mars went underground,\"\r\nthe scarecrow geologist said, and it seemed a strange thing for him to\r\nhave mentioned at that moment, when the stillness was so absolute and\r\nthe thoughts of everyone should have been on the ship, which had to be\r\nvery near now.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and what a vicious, horrible kind of animal life it is,\" Drever\r\nsaid, as if he too welcomed the opportunity to talk irrelevantly,\r\nperhaps to relieve his inner tension.\r\n\r\n\"They're a very primitive form of life, really,\" the geologist said.\r\n\"They look like large gray snakes, but they're actually more like\r\nworms. Worms with sucker disks instead of mouths. When once they've'\r\nattached themselves it's almost impossible to dislodge them. You've\r\nseen marine worms on Earth often enough, I'm sure. They come in all\r\nshapes, sizes and colors, but there are one or two species that look\r\nquite a bit like lamprenes in miniature. Lamprenes are usually about\r\nthree feet in length. But some of the very old ones grow to eight feet\r\nor longer. Their natural prey is a small running lizard--the galaka--as\r\nyou know.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Corriston said, a little of his raw-nerve exasperation\r\nreturning. \"Now I suppose you're going to tell us exactly how they kill\r\ntheir prey.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't have to tell you how they kill men,\" Macklin said. \"You know\r\nas much about that as I do. You've been on Mars before. You've seen at\r\nleast a few of the victims. You know exactly how they come up under a\r\nman when he's asleep, puncture his clothes and attach themselves. He\r\ndoesn't just get nipped; the lamprene can seldom be pulled off that\r\nquickly. And when two or three of them attack you, it can be pretty\r\nhorrible. They're more than just vampires; they sting. The poison is as\r\ndeadly as aconite. It works a little slower, but almost immediately the\r\nvictim starts to degenerate, his nerves first, and, then....\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, now I've heard an expert confirm it. I'd be grateful if\r\nyou'll just shut up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant, I told you--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, Doctor. I'm asking him to shut up.\"\r\n\r\nIn silence they continued on, the tension between them increasing\r\nalmost intolerably, their nerves becoming more and more frayed. And\r\nthen, finally, it seemed to them that they could see the ship, and the\r\ngreat cliff wall surrounding it through the slight haziness left by the\r\nsandstorm and the vaguer haziness which distance imposes, could see the\r\ntumbled, flat slabs of rock that radiated out from it in all directions\r\nacross the desert.\r\n\r\nBut it was hard to be sure it was really the ship. It was perhaps only\r\none of the many desert mirages which were far more common on Mars than\r\nthey were on Earth. A man who has once looked at the bright, scarred\r\nface of a cliff wall in the Martian sunlight will remember it even in\r\nhis dreams and no mirages are really necessary. He is certain to see it\r\na second and a third time, like an after-image so indelibly imprinted\r\non the retina of the human eye that its recurrence becomes inevitable.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, the running man could not have been a mirage. He was much\r\nnearer than the ship appeared to be, and he was falling and getting\r\nup and falling again in so frenzied a way that his movements bore the\r\nunmistakable stamp of reality.\r\n\r\nCorriston came to an abrupt halt. For an instant he simply stared,\r\nwatching the distant figure fall to the sand for the fourth time and\r\ndrag himself forward over the sand, his shoulders heaving convulsively.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Corriston could not have moved if he had wanted to.\r\nThe scarecrow and Drever were standing too close to him, so that the\r\nshoulders of the three men formed a compact unit, and their arms were\r\nin each other's way to such an extent that no real freedom of movement\r\nwas possible.\r\n\r\nCorriston had almost to disentangle himself by sheer physical effort.\r\nDisentangle himself he finally did, turning completely about and\r\nshouting to the colonists behind him.\r\n\r\n\"Get to that man as quickly as possible!\" he ordered. \"There's no time\r\nto be lost. Try to tear the lamprenes off him, but watch out for your\r\nhands. Don't let them coil around you, watch out for the disks. Get\r\nthem off if you can. If you can't, bring him here. Carry him slung\r\nbetween you.\"\r\n\r\nTwo men left the line of march and started off across the desert,\r\nwalking very rapidly but not breaking into a run. Corriston had\r\nforgotten to warn them that running with their weighted shoes would be\r\ndifficult, and would only delay them, and he was glad that they had\r\nthought of it themselves.\r\n\r\nHe turned back to the scarecrow, who was staring in white-lipped horror\r\nat what must have seemed to him an unbelievable occurrence--a man\r\nattacked by lamprenes when he had been talking about lamprenes only an\r\ninstant before.\r\n\r\nBut Corriston knew that it was a common enough occurrence, not to be in\r\nany way coincidental. No one who slept in the desert for any length of\r\ntime could hope to avoid an attack if he failed to take the necessary\r\nprecautions. And even with precautions the death toll was high; almost\r\nas high, perhaps, as cobra fatalities in India.\r\n\r\nCorriston turned abruptly, his lips white. \"If a man is attacked by\r\njust one lamprene, and it's pulled off quickly, how much chance has he?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Drever who answered him. \"Not much, I'm afraid. The poison gets\r\ninto the blood stream and acts quickly. You can't get it out with a\r\nsuction disk the way you sometimes can with a snake bite. It's a nerve\r\npoison and it spreads very fast. And there's no way of neutralizing it,\r\nno serum injection that does any good. Of course, there have been a few\r\nrecoveries.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston swung about and stared out across the desert again. The two\r\ncolonists had reached the stricken man now and were attempting to tear\r\nthe lamprene--or lamprenes--from his flesh. They were bending over him,\r\nand it was hard to tell for a moment whether they were succeeding or\r\nnot. Then, abruptly, one of them rose and made a despairing gesture,\r\nunmistakable even from a distance of five hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThe next few minutes were like a nightmare that has no clear beginning\r\nor end. They brought the man back and laid him down on the sand. The\r\nman was Stone.\r\n\r\nIt was Drever who got the lamprene off. He did it with an electric\r\ntorch, taking care to manipulate the jet of fire in such a way that it\r\nscorched only the head of the creature and not Stone's exposed flesh.\r\n\r\nCorriston bent then, and gripped Stone firmly by the shoulders and\r\nshook him until a look of desperate pleading came into his eyes. He\r\nforced himself not to feel pity, seeing in Stone's closeness to death a\r\nthreat that could have but one outcome if the man refused to speak at\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Helen Ramsey?\" he demanded. \"Where is she, Stone? We're not\r\nlikely to do anything more for you if you don't tell us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I don't know,\" Stone muttered. \"Saddler ... double-crossed Henley.\r\nI guess ... he wanted her for himself. I don't know where he's taken\r\nher. I'm telling you the truth. You've got to believe me.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Corriston said, easing Stone back on the sand. \"I believe\r\nyou. Take it easy now. They've got the lamprene off.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood very still, waiting for his heart to beat normally again,\r\ntelling himself that Saddler had taken an almost suicidal risk in\r\nleaving the ship on foot with no certain refuge in mind. By taking\r\nalong a helpless girl, he was making himself a target for the rage and\r\nrelentless enmity of men who would never rest until they had tracked\r\nhim down.\r\n\r\nThere could be no sanctuary for him anywhere. If he escaped Henley's\r\nvengeance, the colonists would capture him in a matter of days. But\r\nCorriston wasn't thinking in terms of days. He was thinking in terms of\r\nminutes, hours. He stared at the empty stretch of desert ahead, trying\r\ndesperately to control the despair that was welling up inside him. How\r\nlong a head start did Saddler have? Had he left the ship only a few\r\nminutes, or hours before?\r\n\r\nHe'd have to ask Stone one more question. Like a fool he'd put off\r\nasking it, dreading the thought of what Stone's answer might be. But\r\nnow he had no choice. He must ask, and risk knowing that pursuit could\r\nnot be immediately undertaken by one man, that Saddler was miles away\r\nacross the desert, hiding out in some remote and inaccessible cave and\r\nthat tracking him down and putting a bullet through his heart would\r\nhave to be a joint undertaking.\r\n\r\nIt was a cruelly frustrating possibility. It increased Corriston's\r\nrage, his bitterness. The hate within him seemed suddenly violent\r\nenough to destroy anyone or anything. He preferred to go on alone, in\r\nrelentless pursuit of Saddler and if it took days to track him down....\r\n\r\nIt was Freddy's voice that brought him back to reality, startling\r\nand sobering him. Freddy was coming toward him between the tractors,\r\nshouting at the top of his lungs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n21\r\n\r\n\r\nCorriston couldn't quite catch what the lad was shouting at first.\r\nSomething about the dunes and the ship and footprints. Then he caught\r\nthe name of Helen Ramsey and his mouth went dry and for an instant he\r\ncouldn't seem to breathe. Freddy was shouting that he had found Helen\r\nRamsey.\r\n\r\nDr. Drever started and leapt quickly to his feet, his eyes darting with\r\nan understandable solicitude toward the small figure coming toward them\r\nacross the sand. He moved quickly to place himself directly in front\r\nof Stone, as if fearing it would be bad for Freddy to see a man so\r\nclose to death. Then the full significance of Freddy's words seemed to\r\ndawn on him, and his solicitude for his son was replaced by a larger\r\nconcern, a wider sympathy.\r\n\r\n\"You talk to him, Corriston,\" he said. \"You've been living through a\r\nshort stretch of hell. If he's really found her--\"\r\n\r\nCorriston needed no urging. He swayed a little forward, steadied\r\nhimself and broke into a run, meeting Freddy almost midway between the\r\nnearest tractor and the hollow where Drever was crouching.\r\n\r\nFreddy's eyes seemed almost too large for so young a face, large and\r\nimmensely serious. But along with the seriousness Corriston could sense\r\nsomething else, a taper glow of excitement burning bright.\r\n\r\nFreddy had gone exploring. As he told Corriston about it, the words\r\nseemed to flow from him as if they had a mysterious life of their own,\r\nand were somehow reshaping Freddy, making him over into a grown man\r\nwith a heavy stubble of beard and eyes that had looked on far places\r\nand a thousand brilliant suns.\r\n\r\nFreddy had found Helen Ramsey by following her footprints in the sand.\r\nCorriston let Freddy tell it in his own words, shaken by doubts for a\r\nmoment, but finally convinced that the lad couldn't possibly be making\r\nany of it up.\r\n\r\n\"There wasn't a footprint anywhere near the ship, Lieutenant Corriston.\r\nThe sandstorm covered them over. I looked everywhere just to be sure.\r\nI mean there wasn't any prints that could have been made by a woman\r\nleaving the ship with a man. The sand was trampled in a few places,\r\nbecause about ten minutes ago Mr. Macklin and two other men started\r\nlooking too. But that was all.\r\n\r\n\"I remembered then that the sand sometimes stays nearly smooth close to\r\nvery high dunes, even in a storm. There's a--a windbreaking buffer zone\r\nwhere the dunes keep the sand from piling up. I asked Mr. Macklin about\r\nthat once and he told me. I got to thinking that if I just wandered off\r\nI could be back again before anyone missed me.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy turned and gestured toward the ship. \"You can see the dunes\r\nfrom here. Not the ones right behind the ship. Those two bigger ones\r\nover there ... that sort of look like the humps on a camel. I guess\r\nnobody would have been crazy enough to go looking for prints that far\r\naway from the ship. But if I hadn't done it I wouldn't have found her.\r\nThat's for sure.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston said: \"You're so much the opposite of crazy, Freddy, that I'm\r\nafraid you're trying to spare me. It's hard to hurt someone you like,\r\nbut I've got to have the truth.\"\r\n\r\nHis hand tightened on Freddy's shoulder. \"Do you understand, Freddy? I\r\nmust know. Don't lie to spare me. Is she all right?\"\r\n\r\nFreddy looked up at him, troubled, uncertain. \"I think she is. She's\r\nlying down near the bottom of the dune, right where it slopes up again\r\ntoward another dune. It's like one, big, hollow dune. I didn't see her\r\nmove. I guess she must have fainted. He's there, too, lying face down\r\nin the sand halfway up the dune, like he was hurt....\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" Corriston said. \"Now you'd better stay here with your\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't I go back with you? I was afraid to climb down to her alone. I\r\nwas afraid he'd catch me and kill me, and then no one would ever know\r\nI'd found her. He'd be warned and try to get away--\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the right thing to do, the level-headed thing,\" Corriston said.\r\n\"You couldn't have used better judgment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it's all right if I go back with you?\"\r\n\r\nCorriston shook his head. \"No, Freddy. I'd rather you didn't. Don't you\r\nunderstand? You've done _more_ than your share. Now it's my turn.\"\r\n\r\nFreddy tightened his lips and stared for a moment at the glitter of\r\nsunlight on the caterpillar tread of the nearest tractor. Finally he\r\nsaid, \"All right, Lieutenant Corriston. If it's an order.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's an order, Freddy.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston gave Freddy's shoulder a pat. Then, after the briefest\r\npause, he said: \"There's no substitute for the kind of fast-thinking\r\nresourcefulness you've just displayed, Freddy. In a dozen years you'll\r\nbe heading an expedition and it won't be the kind that gets bogged down\r\nafter the first thousand miles. You can take my word for that.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned then and walked toward the ship. In a moment he had passed\r\nthe ship and was moving out into the desert beyond, and Freddy wondered\r\nhow a man could remain so calm in an affair of life and death such as\r\nthis. It was just as well, perhaps, that he could not see Corriston's\r\nface as he moved still further away from the ship into a loneliness of\r\ndesert and sky.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe was lying in a wind-scoured hollow beneath a seventy-foot dune, her\r\nhead resting on one sharply-bent elbow, a look of utter exhaustion on\r\nher face. Her eyes were closed, and even from where he stood Corriston\r\ncould see that she was breathing heavily. He could see the slight rise\r\nand fall of her bosom, the trembling vibration of her oxygen mask. She\r\nwas completely alone.\r\n\r\nHe stood for an instant absolutely motionless on the summit of the\r\ndune, staring down at her, noticing in alarm the hollow contour of her\r\ncheeks on both sides of the oxygen mask, and the slight tinge of gray\r\nthat had crept into her countenance. Then he started downward. Almost\r\ninstantly the sand rose like an unsteady sea on all sides of him, and a\r\nwarning signal sounded in his brain.\r\n\r\nHe could connect it with no cause. Beneath him stretched only the\r\nwind-scoured inner surface of the dune, dazzling his eyes with its\r\nbrightness, mirroring the sunlight like a burning glass. For a moment\r\nthe brightness deceived him, and he did not realize that there were\r\nshadowed hollows directly beneath him, dark fissures in the tumbled\r\nsand wide enough to conceal a crouching man. He did not even see the\r\nshadow creeping toward him over the sand. Only the dazzle for an\r\ninstant and the gleam of sunlight on Helen Ramsey's tousled hair.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, he was aware of the danger, fully awake and aware. But\r\nrealization came too late. Abruptly, without warning, a knife blade\r\nflashed in the sunlight and he felt an agonizing stab of pain just\r\nbelow his left kneecap.\r\n\r\nA dark shape rose before him, and then dissolved into the shadows\r\nagain, darting downward and sideways as it disappeared. Corriston threw\r\nhimself backwards and froze into immobility, thrusting his elbows deep\r\ninto the sand behind him, using that moment of surprise forced upon him\r\nby his assailant to lower his eyes and seek him out.\r\n\r\nHe saw Saddler's face clearly for an instant, saw the gleaming knife\r\nand the hand holding it, and the wavering outline of the man's\r\ncrouching body three-fourths in shadow. He heard Saddler mutter: \"I'm\r\ndone for, Corriston. But I'll get you first.\"\r\n\r\nIt all seemed to happen in slow motion. Corriston's hand went to\r\nhis hip, but with a nightmare feeling of retardation and his fingers\r\nseemed to move without any assistance from the motor centers of his\r\nbrain. Then even more slowly he was facing the hollow with the gun in\r\nhis clasp, and the weapon was exploding into the shadows, filling the\r\nhollows and windy places with reverberating echoes of sound.\r\n\r\nThere was complete silence after that. No groans, no outcry--nothing\r\nbut silence. It went on for so long that Corriston could not shake off\r\na numbing sense of unreality. Surely only a dream could have had so\r\nviolently unreal a beginning, so terrible an outcome. Then he looked\r\ndown, and saw the blood on his leg where the knife had grazed it, and\r\nknew that it could not have been a dream.\r\n\r\nHe was still facing the hollow, with two bullets left in his gun. But\r\nhe knew that he would not have to fire again. Saddler was lying on his\r\nback on the sand, his eyes wide open, his jaw hanging slack. There was\r\na spreading red stain on his chest and a rim of blood around his lips.\r\nThe wind which was blowing across the crest of the dune seemed suddenly\r\nto turn malevolent, striking out at the dead man with a sudden,\r\ndownsweeping gust, ruffling his hair and making him seem to be still\r\nenveloped in violence.\r\n\r\nCorriston felt his throat muscles contract. He forced himself to bend\r\nover and search for a heart beat he knew he wouldn't find, remembering\r\nthe other times when the outcome had been less fatal, when only a man's\r\nface had changed.\r\n\r\nAs his palm rested for an instant above the dead man's heart, the\r\nstirring of the sand immediately beneath him seemed to increase, to\r\nbecome a loud and continuous rustling sound that filled him with a\r\nvague sense of disquiet. He could not quite dismiss from his mind a\r\nfeeling that he was still in danger, that in some strange, almost\r\nterrifying way Saddler was still a menace, and that the terrible\r\nreality of his death had not destroyed all of the hatred and savage\r\nviolence which had forced Corriston to kill him in self-defense.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Corriston realized that what he heard was not the wind\r\nstirring the sand at all, but something quite different. It was closer\r\nto him than the sloping rim of the dunes, and it was accompanied by\r\nmovements directly under his hand, a sudden tightening of the dead\r\nman's skin, a contraction more pronounced than could have been produced\r\nby the abrupt onset of rigor mortis, however freakishly violent or\r\npremature.\r\n\r\nThe rustling continued for perhaps ten more seconds. Then, abruptly, it\r\nstopped and the heads of two lamprenes came into view, moving slowly\r\nacross Saddler's unstirring flesh until their writhing mouth parts were\r\nless than two inches from Corriston's outspread hand.\r\n\r\nThe sight of them brought an instant of terror, an awareness of peril\r\nso acute that Corriston's breath caught in his throat. His hand whipped\r\nback and he leapt to his feet with a convulsive shudder.\r\n\r\nIt was suddenly very still on the dune again. Corriston stood for a\r\nmoment with his body rigid, fearing to look downward, his mind filled\r\nwith a growing sense of panic.\r\n\r\nHad Helen Ramsey been attacked by lamprenes too? No, no, she was all\r\nright; she had to be. Everything confirmed it, her quietness, her\r\nsteady breathing, the simple fact that her eyes had been closed and not\r\nopened wide in torment.\r\n\r\nHe descended the dune like a man ploughing in frantic haste through a\r\nsnowdrift, sinking to his knees and floundering free again, lurching\r\nbackward and sideways, sliding a third of the way.\r\n\r\nShe was all right when he got to her. He dropped down beside her and\r\nlifted her into his arms, and for an instant there was complete silence\r\nbetween them. She just looked at him, looked up into his face steadily\r\nand calmly, as if she could read his mind and had the good sense to\r\nrealize there could be no more certain way of reassuring him. Then\r\nher arms tightened about him. \"Darling,\" she whispered. \"Darling,\r\ndarling....\"\r\n\r\nCorriston started fumbling with his oxygen mask and suddenly he had it\r\noff. He held his breath and more slowly helped her free her lips so\r\nthat he could kiss her. Their lips met and the kiss was longer and more\r\nintense than any they had ever before shared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA half hour later the tractors were in rumbling motion again, their\r\ndestination Ramsey's Citadel. And Corriston had a plan. He knew that it\r\nwas riddled with risks and that he was perhaps quite mad to think that\r\nit might succeed. But the fact that Helen Ramsey was now completely\r\nsafe and had dropped off into a brief, outwardly untroubled sleep\r\nat his side made him feel reckless to the point where a cautious,\r\nlevel-headed man like Drever could only stare at him and shake his head.\r\n\r\nThere was a swaying and a creaking all about them, the slow, steady\r\nrumble of caterpillar treads, and Drever had almost to shout to make\r\nhimself heard. He stood directly opposite Corriston, supporting himself\r\nby a guard rail, and watching the desert through the weather-shield\r\nchange color in the wake of the heavy vehicle's heaving, churning,\r\ntorpedo-shaped rear-end.\r\n\r\n\"Stone's been unconscious now for an hour,\" Drever said, dividing his\r\ngaze between Corriston, and the loosely strapped-in, sleeping girl at\r\nhis side, both swaying with the swaying tractor. \"We can't count on\r\ngetting any more information out of him. I can't wake him up. Drugs\r\nwould be dangerous. I don't think he'll live, but we can't deliberately\r\nkill him to get him to talk.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\n\"But he's the only one who knows why Henley is staying so long at\r\nthe Citadel. He should have been back hours ago. He left before you\r\nescaped from the ship. For all we know, he may be dead. Ramsey may have\r\nlost his head and had him shot, although that seems unlikely. Ramsey\r\nwould go to any length to save his daughter. But we've no way of\r\nknowing whether he believed Henley's story or not. Anything could have\r\nhappened. Henley may have attacked Ramsey.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've a feeling that he's still at the Citadel,\" Corriston said. \"I'll\r\nhave to gamble on that--the one-in-five chance that for some reason the\r\nnegotiations have been prolonged. He may be lying dead in the desert\r\nsomewhere. He may have been attacked by lamprenes. As you say, anything\r\ncould have happened. But when I make up my mind to do something I\r\nusually go through with it. It's just a matter of plain common sense.\r\nYou don't toss aside a decision you've given a great deal of thought to\r\njust because the arguments against it are weighty, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see. So you're still determined to walk right up to the gate and\r\ntell them you're Stone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not? They've never laid eyes on Stone and they don't know me from\r\nAdam. I won't be wearing this uniform. I'll tell them that Henley's\r\nexpecting me, that he left orders for me to join him if he failed to\r\ncome back at a specified time. I'll watch the guard's face and change\r\nmy story a little--if I have to--as I go along.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a _very_ long gamble. I hope you realize that.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's either that or no gamble at all. And we've _got_ to gamble. We're\r\nholding at least two high cards and a joker. Henley has had the ground\r\nshot right out from under him. He's completely alone, and the only\r\nthing he has left to gamble with is his nearness to Ramsey, his ability\r\nto terrify Ramsey by making him believe that his daughter's life is\r\nstill in danger. Ramsey has to be told that Helen has been freed, has\r\nto be warned in time, before he does anything foolish.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you see? With that threat hanging over him, Ramsey would never\r\nlet us get within fifty yards of the Citadel, let alone walk through\r\nthe gates. And if Henley finds out that we've got Helen, he'll know\r\nthat he has nothing left to gamble with except that desperate bluff.\r\nAnd he may doubt his ability to win with a bluff. That would be the\r\nworst tragedy of all. He may turn on Ramsey in blind rage, and kill\r\nhim. He gets a horrible, pathological pleasure out of killing. I've\r\ntold you how he went berserk on the Station.\"\r\n\r\nDrever nodded, and, quite suddenly and unexpectedly, the look of\r\nstubborn opposition was gone from his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you're right, Lieutenant. You can't always tell how the cards\r\nwill fall.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can never tell,\" Corriston said. \"And there are some games where\r\nthe important moves can only be made by just one player, and he usually\r\nhas to be something of a reckless fool.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\n\r\nCorriston left the tractor a hundred and seventy yards from the gate,\r\nwell hidden behind a hundred foot dune. The other tractors had come to\r\na halt a much greater distance from the Citadel, and were spread out\r\nacross the desert in a slightly uneven, double line.\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly forward across the rust-red sand, with a feeling in\r\nhis bones that he was going to be lucky. Yet he knew that he'd have to\r\nbe convincing, or he wouldn't stand a chance. If there was more than\r\none guard at the gate he might never get inside. With luck he might be\r\nable to convince two guards--even three--but never four or five, for\r\nyou couldn't forge words into persuasive enough weapons to disarm the\r\nsuspicion of that many observant men. Not the kind of men who would be\r\nguarding Ramsey, at any rate.\r\n\r\nThe massiveness of the fortified gate shook his confidence a little\r\nas he drew near to it. It was at least fifty feet in height, a solid\r\noblong of inches-thick steel with a desert-mirroring surface. He could\r\nsee his own reflection as he advanced, but it did nothing to reassure\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe knew what he'd have to do, of course. Walk right up to the gate and\r\ntrust to luck that he could find some way of announcing his presence\r\nwithout getting himself killed. How _did_ you gain entrance to an\r\nimpregnable fortress? Surely there had to be some way by which a man\r\ncould gain admittance without being instantly shot down as a hostile\r\nintruder.\r\n\r\nHe was surprised by the simplicity of the answer. There was no need for\r\nhim to press a bell or a buzzer, to manipulate a mechanism of any sort.\r\nThere was not even any need for him to proclaim his arrival by shouting.\r\n\r\nThe gate swung inward without a sound, and in the shadows cast by\r\nits moving bulk two figures silently materialized. They were guards,\r\nheavily armed, one tall with shaggy brows and piercing dark eyes, the\r\nother a wiry little man with reddish hair, his expression peculiarly\r\nbland and non-committal.\r\n\r\nIt was the little man who said: \"All right, come inside. We've been\r\nexpecting you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was impossible, but true. There was nothing threatening in the way\r\nthe words were uttered, just calm acceptance, just the matter-of-fact\r\nindifference of a man who has a duty to perform and doesn't care what\r\nhappens afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut it would have perhaps been better if Corriston had not moved so\r\nquickly forward, for almost instantly the second guard barred his\r\npassage and laid a firm hand on his arm.\r\n\r\n\"Hold on. Just a minute,\" the tall guard said. \"You're Peter Stone,\r\naren't you?\"\r\n\r\nWith a quick pretense of anger Corriston jerked his arm free and looked\r\nthe guard up and down. \"Naturally I'm Stone. Who in hell did you think\r\nI was.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorry,\" the guard said, shrugging. \"Don't take it out on me. I just\r\nhad to be sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you're sure now. I guess you know why I'm here.\"\r\n\r\nThe guard nodded. \"Ramsey just phoned down about you. Your friend is\r\nwith him now. See that big gray building, the one on the left with the\r\nshuttered windows? There's a guard stationed at the door, but he won't\r\nstop you. He has his orders. Climb two flights of stairs and go down\r\nthe long corridor on the third floor. Ramsey and your friend are in the\r\nlast room on the left.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston drew a deep breath, wondering if the guard had noticed the\r\ntightening of his facial muscles. He turned away from the gate slowly,\r\nstaring out over the interior of the fortress, letting his emotions of\r\nthe moment take complete possession of him.\r\n\r\nHe had entered as if by magic a world apart, a small, shutin world\r\nof massive magnificence, of undreamed of material power and wealth.\r\nThere were five buildings within the encircling wall of the fortress,\r\neach monumental in architectural sweep. Each was a citadel alone and\r\napart, monuments to man's creative genius erected by one man with a\r\ndetermination to make himself unique.\r\n\r\nIt was a folly almost beyond belief, a terrifying distortion of human\r\ncreativeness that could lead only to ultimate disaster and defeat.\r\n\r\nBut greedy and cruel and ruthless as Ramsey undoubtedly was, there\r\nstill burned in him a little of the spark that had created Athens in\r\nwhite marble. Had it not been so, he could not have even commissioned\r\nmen of creative genius to transport to Mars the materials for such a\r\nproject and have taken pleasure in its completion.\r\n\r\n\"Your friend got here two hours ago,\" the tall guard said. \"They've\r\nbeen talking ever since. He came down to the gate once and said we\r\nshould let you in, you and another man. Saddler, I think his name was.\r\nI see he's not with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Saddler is not with me,\" Corriston said.\r\n\r\n\"What happened to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"The big gray building with the shuttered windows, you said. If the\r\nguard tries to stop me, what do I say.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told you he had his orders.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston looked up at the massive gate swinging shut behind him. For\r\ngood or ill, he was completely trapped, completely at the mercy of the\r\narmed guards inside the citadel.\r\n\r\nThey hadn't taken his gun away from him, but, nevertheless, he was\r\ntrapped. What chance would one armed man have against seventy-five or\r\na hundred guards? They were keeping out of sight, all but the two at\r\nthe gate. But at any moment they could converge upon him and shoot\r\nhim down. They could choose their own moment, precisely as a research\r\nmedical man could choose his own moment to experiment upon a laboratory\r\nanimal, knowing that the creature was safe in its cage and couldn't\r\npossibly get away.\r\n\r\nCorriston's lips tightened and from a shadowed corner of his mind came\r\na determination to brush all that aside, to ignore it completely. The\r\nguards at the gate might very well be telling the truth. It stood to\r\nreason that Ramsey would have remained secretive about his daughter.\r\nKidnappers do not like to have their ransom demands discussed too\r\nopenly. If Ramsey had been a complete fool he would have gone down\r\nto the gate and taken the guards completely into his confidence, but\r\nCorriston could not believe that Ramsey was that much of a fool.\r\n\r\nIn all probability Henley had threatened Ramsey and provoked him almost\r\nbeyond endurance. There had arisen the questions of how the ransom was\r\nto be paid, the girl set free.\r\n\r\nDamn it, Corriston thought, the thing for me to do now is to go\r\nstraight toward that building and straight up the stairs to the third\r\nfloor and straight down the corridor until I'm confronting Ramsey face\r\nto face. I'm Peter Stone. I'm one of the two men who helped Henley\r\nkidnap the girl and I've come to help Henley convince Ramsey. I've\r\ncome to help him really put the screws on Ramsey. I can improvise from\r\nthat point on.\r\n\r\nHe moved away from the guards without looking back. Within the citadel\r\nthere was silence, stillness, the five massive buildings cutting a\r\nrampart of pure, fragile design across the sky. There was a strange\r\nkind of perfection about the interior of the citadel. It was akin,\r\nsomehow, to the perfection of solitude and even the sky seemed hushed,\r\nexpectant, remote from reality, as if awaiting the unfolding of some\r\nimpossible event, some terrifying drama of violence and retribution\r\nthat could take place nowhere else.\r\n\r\nBut Corriston's reason told him that to believe any such thing would\r\nhave been the height of folly. The sky inside the citadel was just as\r\nreal, just as cloud-flecked and palely blue as the sky outside, and the\r\nnotion that architecture or scenery of any kind could influence events\r\nwas absolute nonsense. Things would happen exactly as he willed them to\r\nhappen, provided nothing stood in the way of immediate drastic action\r\nand the kind of luck which had saved him at the gate continued to smile\r\nupon him.\r\n\r\nThe big gray building with the shuttered windows continued to occupy\r\nmost of his attention, and he walked very resolutely toward it, his\r\neyes on the glimmer of pale light which marked its wide doorway. He was\r\nstill fifty feet away when he saw the guard, standing very quietly just\r\ninside the door with his hand on his gun holster.\r\n\r\nCorriston's lips tightened, but he did not moderate his stride. He had\r\na reply ready if the guard challenged him. He preferred to believe that\r\nhe would not be challenged, but he had no intention of taking anything\r\nfor granted.\r\n\r\nHe continued on until he reached the doorway and then he stopped\r\nabruptly. He waited for the guard to say something, but the man did not\r\nspeak at all. He simply stared quietly at Corriston for an instant, and\r\nthen stepped quickly back into the shadows. Corriston went on past him,\r\nand advanced along the wide corridor that stretched before him.\r\n\r\nThe wide central staircase that circled up did not seem appropriate\r\nto a building that was not a residence and Corriston found himself\r\nwondering if Ramsey had turned the other four buildings into similarly\r\nunusual expressions of his own strong-willed orientation to reality.\r\n\r\nThe buildings had undoubtedly been designed as administrative units\r\nof an industrial empire--a beginning empire in a new world. An empire\r\npredatory, avaricious, merciless. Yet Ramsey had seemingly allowed his\r\ndesire for a home to gain dominance here, had allowed the emotions\r\ncommon to all men to influence his taste in interior architecture in at\r\nleast one of the buildings.\r\n\r\nChalk up that much to Ramsey's credit. In that respect at least, he\r\nwas superior to Henley. In that respect at least a man of good will\r\ncould take sides, all apart from the personal issues involved. Henley\r\nwas a predatory vulture on all counts, his talons constantly spread,\r\nconstantly crimson-tipped. Ramsey was a vulture too, but in the depths\r\nof his mind he knew it. Part of the agony was shared by him, and in\r\none desperate, despairing part of his personality he had tried to be\r\ncreative.\r\n\r\nCorriston ascended the staircase swiftly, casting one brief glance at\r\nsome murals and then ignoring them. The second floor landing stretched\r\naway into shadows, bisected by a wide corridor dimly lighted by\r\noverhead lamps. The second floor had an administrative building aspect\r\nand so did the third floor, which seemed in all respects its exact\r\nduplicate.\r\n\r\nCorriston's excitement grew as he mounted the stairway. He felt like\r\na man poised on the brink of a precipice with no assurance that he\r\nwould not be hurled to his death; a man aware that tragedy would not\r\nstrike him like a thunderbolt at any moment; and yet also like a man\r\nwho thought and felt differently from the trapped and the desperately\r\ndespairing.\r\n\r\nHe felt very confident, very sure of himself, and it seemed to him that\r\nthere was no danger that he could not surmount, and deep within him\r\nthere was something that exulted in the thought and kept him moving\r\nsteadily upward.\r\n\r\nThe third floor was like the second, its long central corridor\r\ndwindling away into shadows. Down it he moved cautiously, remembering\r\nwhat the guard at the gate had said. The third floor, the last door on\r\nyour left.\r\n\r\nRamsey was in conference. But it wasn't a conference of industrial\r\nassociates planning a division of spoils. Ramsey was talking to a\r\nkiller under duress.\r\n\r\nCorriston was half way down the corridor when he heard the shot. It\r\nrang out in the stillness with a terrible clarity, sending echoes\r\nreverberating throughout the building, stopping Corriston in his tracks.\r\n\r\nFor an instant the silence remained absolute, as if the shot had\r\nsomehow silenced all life within the building. Even Corriston's\r\nbreathing was affected by it, so that for an instant he remained like\r\na man horror-blasted into immobility, frozen, a statue with waxen\r\nfeatures and widely dilated eyes.\r\n\r\nThen, abruptly, he ceased to be a statue. He broke into a run, heading\r\nfor the door from which the shot had come.\r\n\r\nHe came to the door and saw that it did not slide open on a panel. It\r\nwas massive, with a knob jutting out from it, and when he grasped the\r\nknob it swung inward instantly and soundlessly and he found himself in\r\na large, blank-walled room brightly illumed by three circular overhead\r\nlamps.\r\n\r\nRamsey was sitting stiff and straight before a desk that was cluttered\r\nwith reference files, manuscripts in folders, pens, pencils and other\r\nwriting materials. His face was drained of all color, and his eyes were\r\nwide and staring. He was looking directly at Corriston, and yet he did\r\nnot seem to see Corriston.\r\n\r\nHe did not appear to be staring at anything in particular, that small,\r\nshrunken, unimpressive-looking little man with graying temples and a\r\nlook of blank incomprehension in his eyes that chilled Corriston to the\r\ncore of his being.\r\n\r\nShaking, wishing that the eyes would close or brighten with relief, or\r\ndo anything but remain so stonily indifferent, Corriston moved closer\r\nto the desk.\r\n\r\nHe saw at once that Ramsey was close to death. He had been shot in the\r\nchest. There was a dull red stain on his chest, and even as Corriston\r\nstared it widened, a butterfly pattern of red, like a Rorschach seen\r\nthrough the eyes of a homicidally inclined psychotic.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Ramsey moved. He caught hold of the desk edge, and swayed a\r\nlittle, but his eyes remained filmed, blankly staring.\r\n\r\nCorriston was bending above him when a familiar voice said: \"He's done\r\nfor. Nothing you can do for him. We had an argument and he lost his\r\nhead. He just couldn't see it my way. So I made a mistake and shot him.\r\nIt was a mistake, all right. I lost _my_ head. Now I've got nothing to\r\nlose by killing you.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston raised his eyes slowly. He had one chance in a hundred\r\nperhaps. He knew it; he sensed it. Henley had somehow managed to stay\r\nout of sight for an instant. The room was very large. There were\r\nshadows in it, and Henley had apparently flattened himself against the\r\nwall behind the desk, in deep shadow.\r\n\r\nBut now he was standing very straight and still behind the desk,\r\nignoring the shuddering form of the man he had shot, little dark\r\ndeathheads dancing in his eyes.\r\n\r\nHenley's nearness did not bother Corriston. Death at ten feet could be\r\nno more final than death at a hundred yards.\r\n\r\nOnly one thing bothered him. Events could move fast when you were close\r\nto a killer.\r\n\r\nHe didn't intend to let them move fast. Not for him, at any rate. He\r\nlet his eyes rest for an instant on the gun in Henley's hand, his\r\nthoughts racing. He knew that he'd be as good as dead if he made a\r\nsingle concession.\r\n\r\nDon't let him know that the gun worries you. Pretend that the odds are\r\neven, even though he's got the drop on you.\r\n\r\nCorriston said: \"How do you know he's fatally wounded? The wound's\r\nthree inches below his heart. You're taking a hell of a lot for\r\ngranted. You just said you made a mistake in shooting him. If he's\r\nrushed to a hospital that mistake may not be your last. You'll have a\r\nchance to go to work on him again.\"\r\n\r\nHenley shook his head, his lips tightening. \"Don't be a fool. He'll be\r\ndead in five minutes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not being a fool,\" Corriston said. \"What will you stand to gain by\r\nshooting me and letting him die? You've got his daughter, but a dead\r\nman won't be able to ransom her.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment, nothing happened. Henley had made no attempt to draw\r\nhis gun, and he did not draw it now. He stood very quietly staring at\r\nCorriston, breathing heavily, a strange, withdrawn look in his eyes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was thinking over what Corriston had said. Corriston\r\nwondered about that for an instant, and then dismissed it from his\r\nmind. You did not take anything for granted when you were standing that\r\nclose to a killer.\r\n\r\nIt was probably too late to save Ramsey. But for the first time he was\r\nstanding very near to Henley with a weapon beneath his hand. If he drew\r\nhis gun instantly and shot Henley through the heart Ramsey might have a\r\nchance. Otherwise....\r\n\r\nSomehow he couldn't do it; not without giving the other some slight\r\nwarning, not without whipping his hand to his gun with a vigor that\r\nwas clear and unmistakable. In matters of crime a fair man is at a\r\ndisadvantage. He can only deal with a murderer in one way.\r\n\r\nHe drew a split second ahead of Henley. He shot Henley three times, the\r\ngun blazing in his hands, and it did not seem important to him that\r\nHenley had also drawn his gun. A tight knot reached into his stomach as\r\nHenley's gun blazed, but he kept right on firing.\r\n\r\nHenley died missing him, not scoring at all. That was the incredible\r\nthing. Henley, an expert shot, a genius at massacre, had missed him\r\nclearly with five shots and now he was down on the floor, clutching at\r\nhis stomach, dragging himself along, while beneath his fingers a dull\r\nred stain grew.\r\n\r\nHis eyes turned glassy suddenly. He tried twice to raise himself but he\r\nfell back each time. He did not speak at all. Blood from his punctured\r\nlungs flooded up into his mouth, and with a terrible, convulsive\r\ntrembling of his entire body he rolled over on his side and lay still.\r\n\r\nCorriston's hands began to sweat beneath the hard, cold gun. He wanted\r\nto drop the weapon, to hurl it from him, but he couldn't somehow. He\r\nhad killed Saddler in immediate self-defense. This had been a little\r\ndifferent--a new experience, a frightening experience and he had been\r\nforced to grit his teeth even in firing, and now that it was all over\r\nhe was tormented inwardly in a way that left him badly shaken.\r\n\r\nHenley was gone now. Dead and still and forever removed from a world\r\nhe had contaminated. Henley had been warped and twisted largely by\r\ncircumstances outside himself; nevertheless a deadly reptile has to be\r\ncrushed when it is about to strike.\r\n\r\nCorriston looked up from the limp form sprawled out on the floor, and\r\nfor a moment the tight lines of his face relaxed a little. Henley was\r\nno longer a menace; the breath of life that had sustained him had\r\nexpired so completely that he had become now a kind of hollow mockery\r\nof something monstrous and distorted that could never harm anyone again.\r\n\r\nIt was Ramsey who had to be considered now, Ramsey who was in peril.\r\n\r\nThe light in the room seemed somehow a little dimmer than it had been.\r\nHe turned slowly back to Ramsey, and for a moment could not quite\r\nbelieve what he saw.\r\n\r\nRamsey's face was changing. The hollows beneath his cheekbones were\r\ndeeper than they had been, and his mouth had gone completely slack, and\r\nhis eyes were uprolled in a quite ghastly way, so that only the whites\r\nshowed.\r\n\r\nSlowly as Corriston stared Ramsey's features began to come apart. The\r\nfamiliar, hideous pattern began to repeat itself on Ramsey's blanched\r\nfeatures. The mouth widened until it turned into a shapeless, colorless\r\ngash in a face that was hardly recognizable. The nose widened and\r\nspread out, the chin receded, and the cheeks became a flattened expanse\r\nof wrinkled flesh that stubbornly refused to stop spreading.\r\n\r\nRamsey's face became a pumpkin face, with slits for eyes and a hideous\r\ncaricature of a mouth that seemed almost to pout as it expanded.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Ramsey was no longer sitting upright before the desk. His body\r\nswayed and began to slump, tilting at first only a little sideways and\r\nthen sliding completely from the chair to the floor.\r\n\r\nRamsey did not descend to the floor with violence. It was a slow,\r\nbarely perceptible gliding motion of his entire body that carried him\r\nfrom an upright position to a prone one in less than thirty seconds.\r\nHis body seemed to collapse inward upon itself, as if he had suddenly\r\nbecome too skeleton-thin for his clothes, as if so much vitality had\r\nbeen drained from him by the shot which had put an end to his life that\r\nhe had given up all hope of maintaining his dignity in death.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the man on the floor had no dignity to maintain. He wasn't\r\nRamsey. He was a hired substitute, an impostor, and quite obviously no\r\nman would undertake to play such a role without calculating all of the\r\nrisks in advance. Perhaps he expected to die without dignity. Perhaps\r\nthat was one of the risks which went with the bargain--the assumption\r\nthat Ramsey might very well be killed in a violent fashion, and that\r\nanyone who stepped into Ramsey's shoes and masqueraded as Ramsey might\r\nexpect a similar fate.\r\n\r\nCorriston felt a nerve begin to twitch violently in his cheek. Why\r\nhad Ramsey kept Henley occupied in so strange a manner, talking to a\r\nnonentity, a stand-in, a double who could never bargain and come to\r\nterms unless Ramsey ordered him to do so? Had Ramsey been incapable of\r\ndealing with Henley directly, and had taken this means of complying\r\nwith the ransom demands?\r\n\r\nIt seemed incredible on the face of it. Ramsey was quite obviously the\r\nkind of man who could live through any kind of private hell if he had\r\nto.\r\n\r\nHe'd have stood up to Henley no matter how great his inner torment.\r\nHe'd have met the ransom demands or rejected them--and it was almost\r\ninconceivable that he would have rejected them--without for an instant\r\nlosing his outward composure. And even inwardly he would have kept a\r\ntight rein on his emotions. He was not the kind of man who would hire\r\nsomeone else to protect him from anything that vitally concerned him,\r\neven with the masks so conveniently at hand.\r\n\r\nWhy then had he employed a double to bargain with Henley and keep him\r\noccupied for so long a time? It didn't matter if Ramsey had made use\r\nof doubles in the past. Probably he had, in order to protect himself\r\nin dealings with the colonists when the advantages of deception\r\nwould favor him. But he would never have done so under these present\r\ncircumstances--when a criminal who would stop at nothing was holding\r\nhis daughter under threat of death.\r\n\r\nHe would never have done so unless he had some very special reason that\r\ndominated his thinking to the exclusion of all else.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Corriston had the answer. It came to him in a lightning-swift\r\nflash of intuition, which carried with it complete credibility. It was\r\nmore than a guess. Somehow he was sure; he knew. A full minute before\r\nhe heard the dull rumble of the tractors as they came through the\r\ngate, and went to the window and stared down, he knew.\r\n\r\nHe had the answer and yet what he saw eclipsed what he knew. It was a\r\nlittle like watching a rocket take off, hearing the roar and seeing the\r\nflames through all of its burning time, and seeing at the same time the\r\nmen on the proving ground moving swiftly about, and the space-helmeted\r\nmen at the controls of the rocket itself, each grimly intent on one\r\nparticular task.\r\n\r\nRamsey was returning into the Citadel with armed guards on both sides\r\nof him, and his daughter was walking with her head erect at his\r\nside. Five colony tractors had followed him into the Citadel and two\r\nmore were just coming through the gate, moving ponderously on their\r\ncaterpillar treads because each tractor weighed two tons even in the\r\nlight gravity of Mars.\r\n\r\nCorriston did an almost unbelievable thing then. Standing quietly\r\nby the window he raised his right hand and saluted Ramsey in silent\r\ntribute to the man's courage at the most threatening moment of his life.\r\n\r\nWhat Ramsey had done in no way lessened his guilt. But Corriston would\r\nhave just as readily repeated the salute in public, without caring what\r\nanyone might think. What Ramsey had done was as clear to him now as a\r\nseries of moves on a chessboard laid out in advance, but hidden from\r\nthe man who was to be outwitted and outplayed.\r\n\r\nRamsey had made use of a double to keep Henley occupied--no doubt with\r\nrepeated, skillful evasions, a constant insistence that more proof be\r\nforthcoming, more details supplied. Perhaps a half-dozen conferences\r\nhad taken place in all, extending over many hours. And while Henley was\r\nbeing encouraged to believe that Ramsey was being softened up and would\r\naccept all of his demands in the end, Ramsey had gone out into the\r\ndesert alone, armed, furious, and determined to rescue his daughter if\r\nit cost him his life.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps he hadn't gone alone. Perhaps he had taken a dozen armed\r\nguards with him. Somehow it didn't seem important, couldn't take away\r\nRamsey's moment of victory. It was a moment of victory for Ramsey even\r\nthough he hadn't played a major role for long, even though he had found\r\nhis daughter already rescued and safe on his return. And Corriston had\r\nbeen the one to move out into the center of the board and deliver the\r\n_coup de grace_. He had kept a restless killer immobilized while the\r\nplay was under way, and that was victory enough for any man.\r\n\r\nCorriston suddenly realized that neither Ramsey nor the Colonists had\r\nany way of knowing that Henley was dead. They had probably joined\r\nforces outside the Citadel for the sole purpose of rescuing him from\r\nthe deadliest kind of danger. And he wasn't helping them at all. In\r\nanother minute they'd be trying to get to him with tear gas.\r\n\r\nIt didn't make any kind of sense, but when Corriston went down the wide\r\ncentral staircase he wasn't thinking about the colonists at all. He was\r\nwondering only how Helen Ramsey would look standing alone on a strange\r\ndark headland at midnight. Then the vision dissolved and another one\r\ntook its place. She wasn't on a headland any more.\r\n\r\nShe was standing at the door of a small, white cottage and there were\r\na couple of kids beside her: a boy of about Freddy's age, or maybe a\r\nlittle younger, and a little girl with golden curls, her hair like a\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nHe realized suddenly that it could never be a small, white cottage.\r\nThere were no small white cottages on the Station, and never could be.\r\nBut the Station would be all right for a married man with kids. The\r\nkids could come and visit him, and his wife could be with him about\r\none-fourth of the time, both on the Station and on Earth.\r\n\r\nWhat more could a happily married man ask, if the Station was so much\r\na part of him that it was never wholly absent from his thoughts? He'd\r\nhave to ask her, of course--at least a dozen times to make sure--that\r\nshe really wanted that kind of man for a husband. But he knew what her\r\nanswer would be even before the vision dissolved, and he was soon out\r\nin the central square between the five buildings, holding her tightly\r\nin his arms.\r\n\r\nFrom the way she kissed him he knew that she must have endured an\r\neternity of torment just from uncertainty, just from not knowing\r\nwhether he was dead or alive. For an instant he could think of nothing\r\nelse but the wonder of it, the absolute reassurance which she had\r\nbrought to him with her closeness, her gratefulness, the intensity of\r\nher concern.\r\n\r\nAcross the square they could see the tractors, looking in the dazzling\r\nlight like massive blocks of metal standing almost end to end. There\r\nwas a great deal of movement and shouting between the buildings, and\r\nCorriston knew that in another half-minute they would no longer be\r\nalone together, that the closeness couldn't last.\r\n\r\nA change was coming over her face, and he was suddenly afraid for her,\r\nafraid that when she was told the full truth about her father just the\r\npain of knowing might make her withdraw from him, even though it could\r\nnever really come between them or separate them for long.\r\n\r\nSo there it was. He could see it in her eyes, the fear, the shadow,\r\nand because he had no way of knowing just how much she already knew\r\nhe decided that only complete honesty could keep the shadow from\r\nlengthening.\r\n\r\nHis hands moved slowly up over her face, and he drew her chin up and\r\nsaid, very gently: \"There's something I'd like to say now, about your\r\nfather. Without his help Henley would have finished what he started out\r\nto do. There are different ways of paying off a debt, and your father--\"\r\n\r\nShe raised her hand as if to put a stop to his words. \"Darling, I know\r\nhe's in serious trouble. Don't try to spare me; there's no need to.\r\nThere will be a trial and we both know what the outcome will be. He'll\r\nnever walk out of the courtroom a free man. But he's not afraid ... and\r\nneither am I. These last few, terrible hours have changed him. He's not\r\nashamed now to admit that he loves me. All the hardness, the coldness,\r\nis gone.\"\r\n\r\nSomething in her voice stilled the questions he wanted to ask. She\r\nseemed to sense what was in his mind, for she said quickly. \"I don't\r\nthink father has any enemies now on Mars. He's going to give the\r\ncolonists back their land. Not because he has to, but because he wants\r\nto. They came to his assistance when they could have used the way\r\nhe cheated and robbed them as an excuse for not helping him at all.\r\nThere are few men who wouldn't feel grateful, who wouldn't be shaken\r\nby remorse. But I think it goes deeper than that. Even now I'm not\r\ncompletely sure, but I think he knows it's the only way he can free\r\nhimself from the prison he's been building around himself since I was a\r\nlittle girl.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent for an instant, while the pain in her eyes seemed to\r\ndeepen. Then she said, \"I can't leave him now, darling. Not right away.\r\nIt would be too cruel a blow.\"\r\n\r\nAhead now Corriston could see three of the colonists coming toward him.\r\nThey were less than forty feet away. \"I think I know how it is,\" he\r\nsaid. \"When you've been through too much, you just go dead inside. You\r\ncan feel sympathy for someone very close, like your father. But that's\r\nabout all....\"\r\n\r\n\"Darling, that's not what I mean. We'll be apart, but just for a little\r\nwhile. It will be so short a time we won't even miss it later on ...\r\ntwo or three weeks, at most. And this time you won't have to wonder\r\nabout me at all.\"\r\n\r\nCorriston noticed then for the first time that her hair had been blown\r\nin all directions by the wind. He remembered how, on their first\r\nmeeting, it had been disarranged in much the same way. She'd been\r\nwearing a beret then, and just the casual tilt of her hat had done\r\nthe fluffing. But wind or no wind, he'd always like the way her hair\r\nlooked, the gold in it, and the way it set off the great beauty of her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"I'd be more than unreasonable if I tried to pick flaws in a promise\r\nlike that,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You can never go home again,\" someone had once said. You can never go\r\nhome because people change and places change with them, and familiar\r\nscenes take on an aspect of strangeness as the old, well-loved\r\nlandmarks fade.\r\n\r\nBut in space, the landmarks are as wide and deep as the gulfs between\r\nthe stars, and it is not too difficult for a man to return to a\r\nsteel-ribbed Gibraltar in space and experience again the emotions he\r\nfelt when he first sighted it, and hear again the long thunder-roll of\r\nthe ships berthing and taking off.\r\n\r\nThe ship which was bringing Corriston back had begun to loom up behind\r\nthe telemetric aerials with her bow slanting forward. She had almost\r\nberthed, and, standing with his face half in shadow, Commander Clement\r\nwatched the landing lights flashing on and off and wondered just what\r\nhe would say to the young lieutenant he'd never met--the very famous\r\nlieutenant who would be emerging from the boarding port and descending\r\nthe ramp any minute now.\r\n\r\nHe told himself that it ought to be something very simple and direct,\r\naccompanied by a friendly handclasp and a nod. \"Welcome back,\r\nLieutenant. Welcome back. I guess you know how I feel about the\r\nscoundrels who kept us from meeting the first time.\"\r\n\r\nYes, just a few words and a friendly handclasp would be best. No\r\nsalutes either given or returned. No stiff-necked salutes, and damn the\r\nregulations for once. It was truly a very great occasion.",
