WHITING, BEAUFORT HOUSE, STRAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be proper, perhaps, to state here, in a very few words, the\r\nobjects which the author had in view in drawing up the following\r\nHistory of Chemistry. Alchymy, or the art of making gold, with which\r\nthe science originated, furnishes too curious a portion of the\r\naberrations of the human intellect to be passed over in silence.\r\nThe writings of the alchymists are so voluminous and so mystical,\r\nthat it would have afforded materials for a very long work. But\r\nI was prevented from extending this part of the subject to any\r\ngreater length than I have done, by considering the small quantity of\r\ninformation which could have been gleaned from the reveries of these\r\nfanatics or impostors; I thought it sufficient to give a general view\r\nof the nature of their pursuits: but in order to put it in the power of\r\nthose who feel inclined to prosecute such investigations, I have given\r\na catalogue of the most eminent of the alchymists and a list of their\r\nworks, so far as I am acquainted with them. This catalogue might have\r\nbeen greatly extended. Indeed it would have been possible to have added\r\nseveral hundred names. But I think the works which I have quoted are\r\nmore than almost any reasonable man would think it worth his while to\r\nperuse; and I can state, from experience, that the information gained\r\nby such a perusal will very seldom repay the trouble.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe account of the chemical arts, with which the ancients were\r\nacquainted, is necessarily imperfect; because all arts and trades were\r\nheld in so much contempt by them that they did not think it worth their\r\nwhile to make themselves acquainted with the processes. My chief\r\nguide has been Pliny, but many of his descriptions are unintelligible,\r\nobviously from his ignorance of the arts which he attempts to describe.\r\nThus circumstanced, I thought it better to be short than to waste a\r\ngreat deal of paper, as some have done, on hypothesis and conjecture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe account of the Chemistry of the Arabians is almost entirely limited\r\nto the works of Geber, which I consider to be the first book on\r\nChemistry that ever was published, and to constitute, in every point\r\nof view, an exceedingly curious performance. I was much struck with\r\nthe vast number of facts with which he was acquainted, and which have\r\ngenerally been supposed to have been discovered long after his time.\r\nI have, therefore, been at some pains in endeavouring to convey a\r\nnotion of Geber’s opinions to the readers of this history; but am not\r\nsure that I have succeeded. I have generally given his own words, as\r\nliterally as possible, and, wherever it would answer the purpose, have\r\nemployed the English translation of 1678.\r\n\r\nParacelsus gave origin to so great a revolution in medicine and the\r\nsciences connected with it, that it would have been unpardonable not\r\nto have attempted to lay his opinions and views before the reader;\r\nbut, after perusing several of his most important treatises, I found\r\nit almost impossible to form accurate notions on the subject. I\r\nhave, therefore, endeavoured to make use of his own words as much\r\nas possible, that the want of consistency and the mysticism of his\r\nopinions may fall upon his own head. Should the reader find any\r\ndifficulty in understanding the philosophy of Paracelsus, he will be\r\nin no worse a situation than every one has been who has attempted to\r\ndelineate the principles of this prince of quacks and impostors. Van\r\nHelmont’s merits were of a much higher kind, and I have endeavoured to\r\ndo him justice; though his weaknesses are so visible that it requires\r\nmuch candour and patience to discriminate accurately between his\r\nexcellencies and his foibles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe history of Iatro-chemistry forms a branch of our subject scarcely\r\nless extraordinary than Alchymy itself. It might have been extended\r\nto a much greater length than I have done. The reason why I did not\r\nenter into longer details was, that I thought the subject more\r\nintimately connected with the history of medicine than of chemistry:\r\nit undoubtedly contributed to the improvement of chemistry; not,\r\nhowever, by the opinions or the physiology of the iatro-chemists, but\r\nby inducing their contemporaries and successors to apply themselves to\r\nthe discovery of chemical medicines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe History of Chemistry, after a theory of combustion had been\r\nintroduced by Beccher and Stahl, becomes much more important. It now\r\nshook off the trammels of alchymy, and ventured to claim its station\r\namong the physical sciences. I have found it necessary to treat of its\r\nprogress during the eighteenth century rather succinctly, but I hope\r\nso as to be easily intelligible. This made it necessary to omit the\r\nnames of many meritorious individuals, who supplied a share of the\r\ncontributions which the science was continually receiving from all\r\nquarters. I have confined myself to those who made the most prominent\r\nfigure as chemical discoverers. I had no other choice but to follow\r\nthis plan, unless I had doubled the size of this little work, which\r\nwould have rendered it less agreeable and less valuable to the general\r\nreader.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith respect to the History of Chemistry during that portion of the\r\nnineteenth century which is already past, it was beset with several\r\ndifficulties. Many of the individuals, of whose labours I had occasion\r\nto speak, are still actively engaged in the prosecution of their\r\nuseful works. Others have but just left the arena, and their friends\r\nand relations still remain to appreciate their merits. In treating of\r\nthis branch of the science (by far the most important of all) I have\r\nfollowed the same plan as in the history of the preceding century. I\r\nhave found it necessary to omit many names that would undoubtedly have\r\nfound a place in a larger work, but which the limited extent to which I\r\nwas obliged to confine myself, necessarily compelled me to pass over. I\r\nhave been anxious not to injure the character of any one, while I have\r\nrigidly adhered to truth, so far as I was acquainted with it. Should I\r\nhave been so unfortunate as to hurt the feelings of any individual by\r\nany remarks of mine in the following pages, it will give me great pain;\r\nand the only alleviation will be the consciousness of the total absence\r\non my part of any malignant intention. To gratify the wishes of every\r\nindividual may, perhaps, be impossible; but I can say, with truth,\r\nthat my uniform object has been to do justice to the merits of all, so\r\nfar as my own limited knowledge put it in my power to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nOF\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST VOLUME.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                   Page\r\n\r\n  Introduction                                                        1\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  Of Alchymy                                                          3\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  Of the chemical knowledge possessed by the Ancients                49\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  Chemistry of the Arabians                                         110\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  Of the progress of Chemistry under Paracelsus and his disciples   140\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  Of Van Helmont and the Iatro-Chemists                             179\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  Of Agricola and metallurgy                                        219\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  Of Glauber, Lemery, and some other chemists of the end of the\r\n  seventeenth century                                               226\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  Of the attempts to establish a theory in chemistry                246\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  Of the foundation and progress of scientific chemistry in Great\r\n  Britain                                                           303\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nChemistry, unlike the other sciences, sprang originally from delusion\r\nand superstition, and was at its commencement exactly on a level\r\nwith magic and astrology. Even after it began to be useful to man,\r\nby furnishing him with better and more powerful medicines than the\r\nancient physicians were acquainted with, it was long before it could\r\nshake off the trammels of alchymy, which hung upon it like a nightmare,\r\ncramping and blunting all its energies, and exposing it to the scorn\r\nand contempt of the enlightened part of mankind. It was not till about\r\nthe middle of the eighteenth century that it was able to free itself\r\nfrom these delusions, and to venture abroad in all the native dignity\r\nof a useful science. It was then that its utility and its importance\r\nbegan to attract the attention of the world; that it drew within its\r\nvortex some of the greatest and most active men in every country; and\r\nthat it advanced towards perfection with an accelerated pace. The field\r\nwhich it now presents to our view is vast and imposing. Its paramount\r\nutility is universally acknowledged. It has become a necessary part of\r\neducation. It has contributed as much to the progress of society, and\r\nhas done as much to augment the comforts and conveniences of life, and\r\nto increase the power and the resources of mankind, as all the other\r\nsciences put together.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to feel a desire to be acquainted with the origin and the\r\nprogress of such a science; and to know something of the history and\r\ncharacter of those numerous votaries to whom it is indebted for its\r\nprogress and improvement. The object of this little work is to gratify\r\nthese laudable wishes, by taking a rapid view of the progress of\r\nChemistry, from its first rude and disgraceful beginnings till it has\r\nreached its present state of importance and dignity. I shall divide the\r\nsubject into fifteen chapters. In the first I shall treat of Alchymy,\r\nwhich may be considered as the inauspicious commencement of the\r\nscience, and which, in fact, consists of little else than an account of\r\ndupes and impostors; every where so full of fiction and obscurity, that\r\nit is a hopeless and almost impossible task to reach the truth. In the\r\nsecond chapter I shall endeavour to point out the few small chemical\r\nrills, which were known to the ancients. These I shall follow in their\r\nprogress, in the succeeding chapters, till at last, augmented by an\r\ninfinite number of streams flowing at once from a thousand different\r\nquarters, they have swelled to the mighty river, which now flows on\r\nmajestically, wafting wealth and information to the civilized world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nOF ALCHYMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe word _chemistry_ (χημεια, _chemeia_) first occurs in Suidas,\r\na Greek writer, who is supposed to have lived in the eleventh\r\ncentury, and to have written his lexicon during the reign of Alexius\r\nComnenus.[1] Under the word χημεια in his dictionary we find the\r\nfollowing passage:\r\n\r\n“CHEMISTRY, the preparation of silver and gold. The books\r\non it were sought out by Dioclesian and burnt, on account of the new\r\nattempts made by the Egyptians against him. He treated them with\r\ncruelty and harshness, as he sought out the books written by the\r\nancients on the chemistry (Περι χημειας) of gold and silver, and burnt\r\nthem. His object was to prevent the Egyptians from becoming rich by the\r\nknowledge of this art, lest, emboldened by abundance of wealth, they\r\nmight be induced afterwards to resist the Romans.”[2]\r\n\r\n[1] The word χημεια is said to occur in several Greek manuscripts of\r\na much earlier date. But of this, as I have never had an opportunity\r\nof seeing them, I cannot pretend to judge. So much fiction has been\r\nintroduced into the history of Alchymy, and so many ancient names have\r\nbeen treacherously dragged into the service, that we may be allowed\r\nto hesitate when no evidence is presented sufficient to satisfy a\r\nreasonable man.\r\n\r\n[2] Χημεια, ἡ του αργυρου και χρυσου κατασκευη· ἡς τα βιβλια\r\nδιερευνησαμενος ὁ Διοκλητιανος εκαυσε, δια τα νεωτερισθεντα αιγυπτιοις\r\nΔιοκλητιανω· τουτοις ανημερως και φονικως εχρησατο ὁτεδη και τα\r\nπερι χημειας χρυσου και αργυρου τοις παλαιοις γεγραμμενα βιβλια\r\nδιερευνησαμενος εκαυσε, προς το μηκετι πλουτον αιγυπτιοις εκ της\r\nτοιαυτης προσγινεσθαι τεχνης, μηδε χρηματων αυτοις θαρῥονιτας περιουσια\r\nτου λοιπου ῥωμαιοις ανταιρειν.\r\n\r\nUnder the word Δερας, _deras_ (_a skin_), in the lexicon, occurs the\r\nfollowing passage: “Δερας, the golden fleece, which Jason and the\r\nArgonauts (after a voyage through the Black Sea to Colchis) took,\r\ntogether with Medea, daughter of Ætes, the king. But this was not\r\nwhat the poets represent, but a treatise written on skins (δερμασι),\r\nteaching how gold might be prepared by chemistry. Probably, therefore,\r\nit was called by those who lived at that time, _golden_, on account of\r\nits great importance.”[3]\r\n\r\n[3] Δερας, το χρυσομαλλον δερας, ὁπερ ὁ Ιασων δια της ποντικης\r\nθαλασσης συν τοις αργοναυταις εις την κολχιδα παραγενομενοι ελαβον,\r\nκαι την Μηδειαν την Αιητου του βασιλεως θυγατερα. Τουτο δε ουκ ὡς\r\nποιητικως φερεται· αλλα βιβλιον ην εν δερμασι γεγραμενον περισχον ὁπως\r\nδειγινεσθαι δια χημειας χρυσον· εικοτως ουν ὁι τοτε χρουσουν ωνομαζον\r\nαυτο δερας δια την ενεργειαν την εξ αυτου.\r\n\r\nFrom these two passages there can be no doubt that the word _chemistry_\r\nwas known to the Greeks in the eleventh century; and that it signified,\r\nat that time, the art of making gold and silver. It appears, further,\r\nthat in Suidas’s opinion, this art was known to the Egyptians in the\r\ntime of Dioclesian; that Dioclesian was convinced of its reality;\r\nand that, to put an end to it, he collected and burnt all the\r\nchemical writings to be found in Egypt. Nay, Suidas affirms that a\r\nbook, describing the art of making gold, existed at the time of the\r\nArgonauts: and that the object of Jason and his followers was to get\r\npossession of that invaluable treatise, which the poets disguised under\r\nthe term _golden fleece_.\r\n\r\nThe first meaning, then, of chemistry, was the _art of making gold_.\r\nAnd this art, in the opinion of Suidas, was understood at least as\r\nearly as one thousand two hundred and twenty-five years before\r\nthe Christian era: for that is the period at which the Argonautic\r\nexpedition is commonly fixed by chronologists.\r\n\r\nThough the lexicon of Suidas be the first printed book in which the\r\nword Chemistry occurs, yet it is said to be found in much earlier\r\ntracts, which still continue in manuscript. Thus Scaliger informs us\r\nthat he perused a Greek manuscript of Zosimus, the Panapolite, written\r\nin the fifth century, and deposited in the King of France’s library.\r\nOlaus Borrichius mentions this manuscript; but in such terms that it\r\nis difficult to know whether he had himself read it; though he seems\r\nto insinuate as much.[4] The title of this manuscript is said to be\r\n“A faithful Description of the sacred and divine Art of making Gold\r\nand Silver, by Zosimus, the Panapolite.”[5] In this treatise, Zosimus\r\ndistinguishes the art by the name χημια, _chemia_. From a passage\r\nin this manuscript, quoted by Scaliger, and given also by Olaus\r\nBorrichius, it appears that Zosimus carries the antiquity of the art of\r\nmaking gold and silver, much higher than Suidas has ventured to do. The\r\nfollowing is a literal translation of this curious passage:\r\n\r\n[4] De Ortu et Progressu Chemiæ, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[5] Σωσιμου του παναπολιτου γνησια γραφη, περι της ἱερας, και θειας\r\nτεχνης του χρυσου και αργυριου ποιησιος. Παναπολις was a city in Egypt.\r\n\r\n“The sacred Scriptures inform us that there exists a tribe of genii,\r\nwho make use of women. Hermes mentions this circumstance in his\r\nPhysics; and almost every writing (λογος), whether sacred (φανερος) or\r\napocryphal, states the same thing. The ancient and divine Scriptures\r\ninform us, that the angels, captivated by women, taught them all the\r\noperations of nature. Offence being taken at this, they remained out of\r\nheaven, because they had taught mankind all manner of evil, and things\r\nwhich could not be advantageous to their souls. The Scriptures inform\r\nus that the giants sprang from these embraces. Chema is the first of\r\ntheir traditions respecting these arts. The book itself they called\r\nChema; hence the art is called _Chemia_.”\r\n\r\nZosimus is not the only Greek writer on Chemistry. Olaus Borrichius has\r\ngiven us a list of thirty-eight treatises, which he says exist in the\r\nlibraries of Rome, Venice, and Paris: and Dr. Shaw has increased this\r\nlist to eighty-nine.[6] But among these we find the names of Hermes,\r\nIsis, Horus, Democritus, Cleopatra, Porphyry, Plato, &c.--names which\r\nundoubtedly have been affixed to the writings of comparatively modern\r\nand obscure authors. The style of these authors, as Borrichius informs\r\nus, is barbarous. They are chiefly the production of ecclesiastics,\r\nwho lived between the fifth and twelfth centuries. In these tracts,\r\nthe art of which they treat is sometimes called _chemistry_ (χημεια);\r\nsometimes the _chemical art_ (χημευτικα); sometimes the _holy art_; and\r\nthe _philosopher’s stone_.\r\n\r\n[6] Shaw’s Translation of Boerhaave’s Chemistry, i. 20.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from this, that between the fifth century and the taking\r\nof Constantinople in the fifteenth century, the Greeks believed in the\r\npossibility of making gold and silver artificially; and that the art\r\nwhich professed to teach these processes was called by them Chemistry.\r\n\r\nThese opinions passed from the Greeks to the Arabians, when, under the\r\ncalifs of the family of Abassides, they began to turn their attention\r\nto science, about the beginning of the ninth century; and when the\r\nenlightened zeal of the Fatimites in Africa, and the Ommiades in Spain,\r\nencouraged the cultivation of the sciences. From Spain they gradually\r\nmade their way into the different Christian kingdoms of Europe. From\r\nthe eleventh to the sixteenth century, the art of making gold and\r\nsilver was cultivated in Germany, Italy, France, and England, with\r\nconsiderable assiduity. The cultivators of it were called _Alchymists_;\r\na name obviously derived from the Greek word _chemia_, but somewhat\r\naltered by the Arabians. Many alchymistical tracts were written during\r\nthat period. A considerable number of them were collected by Lazarus\r\nZetzner, and published at Strasburg in 1602, under the title of\r\n“Theatrum Chemicum, præcipuos selectorum auctorum tractatus de Chemiæ\r\net Lapidis Philosophici Antiquitate, veritate, jure, præstantia, et\r\noperationibus continens in gratiam veræ Chemiæ et Medicinæ Chemicæ\r\nStudiosorum (ut qui uberrimam unde optimorum remediorum messem facere\r\npoterunt) congestum et in quatuor partes seu volumina digestum.” This\r\nbook contains one hundred and five different alchymistical tracts.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1610 another collection of alchymistical tracts was\r\npublished at Basil, in three volumes, under the title of “Artis\r\nAuriferæ quam Chemiam vocant volumina tria.” It contains forty-seven\r\ndifferent tracts.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1702 Mangetus published at Geneva two very large folio\r\nvolumes, under the name of “Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa, seu rerum\r\nad Alchymiam pertinentium thesaurus instructissimus, quo non tantum\r\nArtis Auriferæ ac scriptorum in ea nobiliorum Historia traditur;\r\nlapidis veritas Argumentis et Experimentis innumeris, immo et Juris\r\nConsultorum Judiciis evincitur; Termini obscuriores explicantur;\r\nCautiones contra Impostores et Difficultates in Tinctura Universali\r\nconficienda occurrentes declarantur: verum etiam Tractatus omnes\r\nVirorum Celebriorum, qui in Magno sudarunt Elixyre, quique ab ipso\r\nHermete, ut dicitur, Trismegisto, ad nostra usque tempora de Chrysopoea\r\nscripserunt, cum præcipuis suis Commentariis, concinno ordine dispositi\r\nexhibentur.” This Bibliotheca contains one hundred and twenty-two\r\nalchymistical treatises, many of them of considerable length.\r\n\r\nTwo additional volumes of the Theatrum Chemicum were afterwards\r\npublished; but these I have never had an opportunity of seeing.\r\n\r\nFrom these collections, which exhibit a pretty complete view of the\r\nwritings of the alchymists, a tolerably accurate notion may be formed\r\nof their opinions. But before attempting to lay open the theories and\r\nnotions by which the alchymists were guided, it will be proper to state\r\nthe opinions which were gradually adopted respecting the origin of\r\nAlchymy, and the contrivances by which these opinions were supported.\r\n\r\nZosimus, the Panapolite, in a passage quoted above informs us, that\r\nthe art of making gold and silver was not a human invention; but was\r\ncommunicated to mankind by angels or demons. These angels, he says,\r\nfell in love with women, and were induced by their charms to abandon\r\nheaven altogether, and take up their abode upon earth. Among other\r\npieces of information which these spiritual beings communicated to\r\ntheir paramours, was the sublime art of Chemistry, or the fabrication\r\nof gold and silver.\r\n\r\nIt is quite unnecessary to refute this extravagant opinion, obviously\r\nfounded on a misunderstanding of a passage in the sixth chapter of\r\nGenesis. “And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face\r\nof the earth, and daughters were born unto them, that the sons of God\r\nsaw the daughters of men, that they were fair; and they took them wives\r\nof all which they chose.--There were giants in the earth in those days;\r\nand also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters\r\nof men, and they bare _children_ to them; the same became mighty men,\r\nwhich were of old, men of renown.”\r\n\r\nThere is no mention whatever of angels, or of any information on\r\nscience communicated by them to mankind.\r\n\r\nNor is it necessary to say much about the opinion advanced by some,\r\nand rather countenanced by Olaus Borrichius, that the art of making\r\ngold was the invention of Tubal-cain, whom they represent as the same\r\nas Vulcan. All the information which we have respecting Tubal-cain,\r\nis simply that he was an instructor of every artificer in brass and\r\niron.[7] No allusion whatever is made to gold. And that in these early\r\nages of the world there was no occasion for making gold artificially,\r\nwe have the same authority for believing. For in the second chapter\r\nof Genesis, where the garden of Eden is described, it is said, “And\r\na river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was\r\nparted, and came into four heads: the name of the first is Pison,\r\nthat is it which encompasseth the whole land of Havilah, where there\r\nis gold. And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and\r\nonyx-stone.”\r\n\r\n[7] Genesis iv. 22.\r\n\r\nBut the most generally-received opinion is, that alchymy originated in\r\nEgypt; and the honour of the invention has been unanimously conferred\r\nupon Hermes Trismegistus. He is by some supposed to be the same person\r\nwith Chanaan, the son of Ham, whose son Mizraim first occupied and\r\npeopled Egypt. Plutarch informs us, that Egypt was sometimes called\r\n_Chemia_.[8] This name is supposed to be derived from Chanaan (ןענכ);\r\nthence it was believed that Chanaan was the true inventor of alchymy,\r\nto which he affixed his own name. Whether the Hermes (Ἑρμης) of\r\nthe Greeks was the same person with Chanaan or his son Mizraim, it\r\nis impossible at this distance of time to decide; but to Hermes is\r\nassigned the invention of alchymy, or the art of making gold, by almost\r\nthe unanimous consent of the adepts.\r\n\r\n[8] De Iside and Osiride, c. 5.\r\n\r\nAlbertus Magnus informs us, that “Alexander the Great discovered the\r\nsepulchre of Hermes, in one of his journeys, full of all treasures,\r\nnot metallic, but golden, written on a table of _zatadi_, which others\r\ncall emerald.” This passage occurs in a tract of Albertus _de secretis\r\nchemicis_, which is considered as supposititious. Nothing is said of\r\nthe source whence the information contained in this passage was drawn:\r\nbut, from the quotations produced by Kriegsmann, it would appear that\r\nthe existence of this emerald table was alluded to by Avicenna and\r\nother Arabian writers. According to them, a woman called Sarah took it\r\nfrom the hands of the dead body of Hermes, some ages after the flood,\r\nin a cave near Hebron. The inscription on it was in the Phœnician\r\nlanguage. The following is a literal translation of this famous\r\ninscription, from the Latin version of Kriegsmann:[9]\r\n\r\n[9] There are two Latin translations of these tables (unless we are\r\nrather to consider them as originals, for no Phœnician nor Greek\r\noriginal exists). I shall insert them both here.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--VERBA SECRETORUM HERMETIS TRISMEGISTI.\r\n\r\n  1. Verum sine mendacio certum et verissimum.\r\n\r\n  2. Quod est inferius, est sicut quod est superius, et quod est\r\n  superius est sicut quod est inferius ad perpetranda miracula rei\r\n  unius.\r\n\r\n  3. Et sicut omnes res fuerant ab uno meditatione unius: sic\r\n  omnes res natæ fuerunt ab hac una re adaptatione.\r\n\r\n  4. Pater ejus est Sol, mater ejus Luna, portavit illud ventus\r\n  in ventre suo, nutrix ejus terra est.\r\n\r\n  5. Pater omnis thelesmi totius mundi est hic.\r\n\r\n  6. Vis ejus integra est, si versa fuerit in terram.\r\n\r\n  7. Separabis terram ab igne, subtile a spisso suaviter cum\r\n  magno ingenio.\r\n\r\n  8. Ascendit a terra in cœlum, iterumque descendit in terram,\r\n  et recipit vim superiorum et inferiorum, sic habebis gloriam\r\n  totius mundi. Ideo fugiat a te omnis obscuritas.\r\n\r\n  9. Hic est totius fortitudinis fortitudo fortis; quia vincit\r\n  omnem rem subtilem, omnemque solidam penetrabit.\r\n\r\n  10. Sic mundus creatus est.\r\n\r\n  11. Hinc adaptationes erunt mirabiles, quarum modus est\r\n  hic.\r\n\r\n  12. Itaque vocatus sum Hermes Trismegistus, habens tres\r\n  partes philosophiæ totius mundi.\r\n\r\n  13. Completum est quod dixi de operatione solis.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--DESCRIPTIO ARCANORUM HERMETIS TRISMEGISTI.\r\n\r\n  1. Vere non ficte, certo verissime aio.\r\n\r\n  2. Inferiora hæc cum superioribus illis, istaque cum iis vicissim\r\n  vires sociant, ut producant rem unam omnium mirificissimam.\r\n\r\n  3. Ac quemadmodum cuncta educta ex uno fuere verbo Dei\r\n  unius: sic omnes quoque res perpetuo ex hac una re generantur\r\n  dispositione Naturæ.\r\n\r\n  4. Patrem ea habet Solem, matrem Lunam: ab aëre in utero\r\n  quasi gestatur, nutritur a terra.\r\n\r\n  5. Causa omnis perfectionis rerum ea est per univerum hoc.\r\n\r\n  6. Ad summam ipsa perfectionem virium pervenit si redierit\r\n  in humum.\r\n\r\n  7. In partes tribuite humum ignem passam, attenuans densitatem\r\n  ejus re omnium suavissima.\r\n\r\n  8. Summa ascende ingenii sagacitate a terra in cœlum, indeque\r\n  rursum in terram descende, ac vires superiorum inferiorumque\r\n  coge in unum: sic potiere gloria totius mundi atque ita abjectæ\r\n  sortis homo amplius non habere.\r\n\r\n  9. Isthæc jam res ipsa fortitudine fortior existet; corpora\r\n  quippe tam tenuia quam solida penetrando subige.\r\n\r\n  10. Atque sic quidem quæcunque mundus continet creata fuere.\r\n\r\n  11. Hinc admiranda evadunt opera, quæ ad eundum modum\r\n  instituantur.\r\n\r\n  12. Mihi vero ideo nomen Hermetis Trismegisti impositum\r\n  fuit, quod trium mundi sapientiæ partium doctor deprehensus\r\n  sum.\r\n\r\n  13. Hæc sunt quæ de chemicæ artis prestantissimo opere\r\n  consignanda esse duxi.\r\n\r\n\r\n  1. I speak not fictitious things, but what is true and\r\n  most certain.\r\n\r\n  2. What is below is like that which is above, and\r\n  what is above is similar to that which is below, to accomplish\r\n  the miracles of one thing.\r\n\r\n  3. And as all things were produced by the meditation\r\n  of one Being, so all things were produced from\r\n  this one thing by adaptation.\r\n\r\n  4. Its father is _Sol_, its mother _Luna_; the wind\r\n  carried it in its belly, the earth is its nurse.\r\n\r\n  5. It is the cause of all perfection throughout the\r\n  whole world.\r\n\r\n  6. Its power is perfect, if it be changed into earth.\r\n\r\n  7. Separate the earth from the fire, the subtile\r\n  from the gross, acting prudently and with judgment.\r\n\r\n  8. Ascend with the greatest sagacity from the earth\r\n  to heaven, and then again descend to the earth, and\r\n  unite together the powers of things superior and things\r\n  inferior. Thus you will possess the glory of the whole\r\n  world; and all obscurity will fly far away from you.\r\n\r\n  9. This thing has more fortitude than fortitude itself;\r\n  because it will overcome every subtile thing, and\r\n  penetrate every solid thing.\r\n\r\n  10. By it this world was formed.\r\n\r\n  11. Hence proceed wonderful things, which in this\r\n  wise were established.\r\n\r\n  12. For this reason I am called Hermes Trismegistus,\r\n  because I possess three parts of the philosophy of\r\n  the whole world.\r\n\r\n  13. What I had to say about the operation of _Sol_\r\n  is completed.\r\n\r\nSuch is a literal translation of the celebrated inscription of Hermes\r\nTrismegistus upon the emerald tablet. It is sufficiently obscure to\r\nput it in the power of commentators to affix almost any explanation to\r\nit that they choose. The two individuals who have devoted most time\r\nto illustrate this tablet, are Kriegsmann and Gerard Dorneus, whose\r\ncommentaries may be seen in the first volume of Mangetus’s Bibliotheca\r\nChemica. They both agree that it refers to the _universal medicine_,\r\nwhich began to acquire celebrity about the time of Paracelsus, or a\r\nlittle earlier.\r\n\r\nThis exposition, which appears as probable as any other, betrays\r\nthe time when this celebrated inscription seems to have been really\r\nwritten. Had it been taken out of the hands of the dead body of Hermes\r\nby Sarah (obviously intended for the wife of Abraham) as is affirmed\r\nby Avicenna, it is not possible that Herodotus, and all the writers of\r\nantiquity, both Pagan and Christian, should have entirely overlooked\r\nit; or how could Avicenna have learned what was unknown to all those\r\nwho lived nearest the time when the discovery was supposed to have been\r\nmade? Had it been discovered in Egypt by Alexander the Great, would\r\nit have been unknown to Aristotle, and to all the numerous tribe of\r\nwriters whom the Alexandrian school produced, not one of whom, however,\r\nmake the least allusion to it? In short, it bears all the marks of\r\na forgery of the fifteenth century. And even the tract ascribed to\r\nAlbertus Magnus, in which the tablet of Hermes is mentioned, and the\r\ndiscovery related, is probably also a forgery; and doubtless a forgery\r\nof the same individual who fabricated the tablet itself, in order to\r\nthrow a greater air of probability upon a story which he wished to palm\r\nupon the world as true. His object was in some measure accomplished;\r\nfor the authenticity of the tablet was supported with much zeal by\r\nKriegsmann, and afterwards by Olaus Borrichius.\r\n\r\nThere is another tract of Hermes Trismegistus, entitled “Tractatus\r\nAureus de Lapidis Physici Secreto;” on which no less elaborate\r\ncommentaries have been written. It professes to teach the process of\r\nmaking the _philosopher’s stone_; and, from the allusions in it, to the\r\nuse of this stone, as a universal medicine, was probably a forgery of\r\nthe same date as the emerald tablet. It would be in vain to attempt to\r\nextract any thing intelligible out of this Tractatus Aureus: it may be\r\nworth while to give a single specimen, that the reader may be able to\r\nform some idea of the nature of the style.\r\n\r\n“Take of moisture an ounce and a half; of meridional redness, that is\r\nthe soul of the sun, a fourth part, that is half an ounce; of yellow\r\nseyr, likewise half an ounce; and of auripigmentum, a half ounce,\r\nmaking in all three ounces. Know that the vine of wise men is extracted\r\nin threes, and its wine at last is completed in thirty.”[10]\r\n\r\n[10] “Accipe de humore unciam unam et mediam, et de rubore meridionali,\r\nid est anima solis, quartam partem, id est, unciam mediam, et de Seyre\r\ncitrino, similiter unciam mediam, et de auripigmenti dimidium, quæ\r\nsunt octo, id est unciæ tres. Scitote quod vitis sapientum in tribus\r\nextrahitur, ejusque vinum in fine triginta peragitur.”\r\n\r\nHad the opinion, that gold and silver could be artificially formed\r\noriginated with Hermes Trismegistus, or had it prevailed among\r\nthe ancient Egyptians, it would certainly have been alluded to by\r\nHerodotus, who spent so many years in Egypt, and was instructed by\r\nthe priests in all the science of the Egyptians. Had _chemistry_ been\r\nthe name of a science, real or fictitious, which existed as early as\r\nthe expedition of the Argonauts, and had so many treatises on it, as\r\nSuidas alleges existed in Egypt before the reign of Dioclesian, it\r\ncould hardly have escaped the notice of Pliny, who was so curious\r\nand so indefatigable in his researches, and who has collected in his\r\nnatural history a kind of digest of all the knowledge of the ancients\r\nin every department of practical science. The fact that the term\r\nchemistry (χημεια) never occurs in any Greek or Roman writer prior to\r\nSuidas, who wrote so late as the eleventh century, seems to overturn\r\nall idea of the existence of that pretended science among the ancients,\r\nnotwithstanding the elaborate attempts of Olaus Borrichius to prove the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\nI am disposed to believe, that chemistry or alchymy, understanding\r\nby the term the _art of making gold and silver_, originated among\r\nthe Arabians, when they began to turn their attention to medicine,\r\nafter the establishment of the caliphs; or if it had previously been\r\ncultivated by Greeks (as the writings of Zosimus, the Panapolite,\r\nif genuine, would lead us to suppose), that it was taken up by the\r\nArabians, and reduced by them into regular form and order. If the works\r\nof Geber be genuine, they leave little doubt on this point. Geber is\r\nsupposed to have been a physician, and to have written in the seventh\r\ncentury. He admits, as a first principle, that metals are compounds of\r\nmercury and sulphur. He talks of the philosopher’s stone; professes\r\nto give the mode of preparing it; and teaches the way of converting\r\nthe different metals, known in his time, into medicines, on whose\r\nefficacy he bestows the most ample panegyrics. Thus the principles\r\nwhich lie at the bottom of alchymy were implicitly adopted by him.\r\nYet I can nowhere find in him any attempt to make gold artificially.\r\nHis chemistry was entirely devoted to the improvement of medicine.\r\nThe subsequent pretensions of the alchymists to convert the baser\r\nmetals into gold are no where avowed by him. I am disposed from this\r\nto suspect, that the theory of gold-making was started after Geber’s\r\ntime, or at least that it was after the seventh century, before any\r\nalchymist ventured to affirm that he himself was in possession of the\r\nsecret, and could fabricate gold artificially at pleasure. For there is\r\na wide distance between the opinion that gold may be made artificially\r\nand the affirmation that we are in possession of a method by which this\r\ntransmutation of the baser metals into gold can be accomplished. The\r\nfirst may be adopted and defended with much plausibility and perfect\r\nhonesty; but the second would require a degree of skill far exceeding\r\nthat of the most scientific votary of chemistry at present existing.\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the alchymists was, that all the metals are compounds;\r\nthat the baser metals contain the same constituents as gold,\r\ncontaminated, indeed, with various impurities, but capable, when their\r\nimpurities are removed or remedied, of assuming all the properties and\r\ncharacters of gold. The substance possessing this wonderful power they\r\ndistinguish by the name of _lapis philosophorum_, or, philosopher’s\r\nstone, and they usually describe it as a red powder, having a peculiar\r\nsmell. Few of the alchymists who have left writings behind them boast\r\nof being possessed of the philosopher’s stone. Paracelsus, indeed,\r\naffirms, that he was acquainted with the method of making it, and\r\ngives several processes, which, however, are not intelligible. But\r\nmany affirm that they had seen the philosopher’s stone; that they had\r\nportions of it in their possession; and that they had seen several of\r\nthe inferior metals, especially lead and quicksilver, converted by\r\nmeans of it into gold. Many stories of this kind are upon record, and\r\nso well authenticated, that we need not be surprised at their having\r\nbeen generally credited. It will be sufficient if we state one or two\r\nof those which depend upon the most unexceptionable evidence. The\r\nfollowing relation is given by Mangetus, on the authority of M. Gros, a\r\nclergyman of Geneva, of the most unexceptionable character, and at the\r\nsame time a skilful physician and expert chemist:\r\n\r\n“About the year 1650 an unknown Italian came to Geneva, and took\r\nlodgings at the sign of the _Green Cross_. After remaining there a\r\nday or two, he requested De Luc, the landlord, to procure him a man\r\nacquainted with Italian, to accompany him through the town and point\r\nout those things which deserved to be examined. De Luc was acquainted\r\nwith M. Gros, at that time about twenty years of age, and a student\r\nin Geneva, and knowing his proficiency in the Italian language,\r\nrequested him to accompany the stranger. To this proposition he\r\nwillingly acceded, and attended the Italian every where for the space\r\nof a fortnight. The stranger now began to complain of want of money,\r\nwhich alarmed M. Gros not a little--for at that time he was very\r\npoor--and he became apprehensive, from the tenour of the stranger’s\r\nconversation, that he intended to ask the loan of money from him. But\r\ninstead of this, the Italian asked him if he was acquainted with any\r\ngoldsmith, whose bellows and other utensils they might be permitted\r\nto use, and who would not refuse to supply them with the different\r\narticles requisite for a particular process which he wanted to perform.\r\nM. Gros named a M. Bureau, to whom the Italian immediately repaired.\r\nHe readily furnished crucibles, pure tin, quicksilver, and the other\r\nthings required by the Italian. The goldsmith left his workshop, that\r\nthe Italian might be under the less restraint, leaving M. Gros, with\r\none of his own workmen, as an attendant. The Italian put a quantity\r\nof tin into one crucible, and a quantity of quicksilver into another.\r\nThe tin was melted in the fire and the mercury heated. It was then\r\npoured into the melted tin, and at the same time a red powder enclosed\r\nin wax was projected into the amalgam. An agitation took place,\r\nand a great deal of smoke was exhaled from the crucible; but this\r\nspeedily subsided, and the whole being poured out, formed six heavy\r\ningots, having the colour of gold. The goldsmith was called in by the\r\nItalian, and requested to make a rigid examination of the smallest of\r\nthese ingots. The goldsmith, not content with the touchstone and the\r\napplication of aqua fortis, exposed the metal on the cupel with lead,\r\nand fused it with antimony, but it sustained no loss. He found it\r\npossessed of the ductility and specific gravity of gold; and full of\r\nadmiration, he exclaimed that he had never worked before upon gold so\r\nperfectly pure. The Italian made him a present of the smallest ingot\r\nas a recompence, and then, accompanied by M. Gros, he repaired to the\r\nMint, where he received from M. Bacuet, the mintmaster, a quantity of\r\nSpanish gold coin, equal in weight to the ingots which he had brought.\r\nTo M. Gros he made a present of twenty pieces, on account of the\r\nattention that he had paid to him; and, after paying his bill at the\r\ninn, he added fifteen pieces more, to serve to entertain M. Gros and\r\nM. Bureau for some days, and in the mean time he ordered a supper,\r\nthat he might, on his return, have the pleasure of supping with these\r\ntwo gentlemen. He went out, but never returned, leaving behind him the\r\ngreatest regret and admiration. It is needless to add, that M. Gros and\r\nM. Bureau continued to enjoy themselves at the inn till the fifteen\r\npieces, which the stranger had left, were exhausted.”[11]\r\n\r\n[11] Preface to Mangetus’s Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa.\r\n\r\nMangetus gives also the following relation, which he states upon the\r\nauthority of an English bishop, who communicated it to him in the year\r\n1685, and at the same time gave him about half an ounce of the gold\r\nwhich the alchymist had made:\r\n\r\nA stranger, meanly dressed, went to Mr. Boyle, and after conversing\r\nfor some time about chemical processes, requested him to furnish him\r\nwith antimony, and some other common metallic substances, which then\r\nfortunately happened to be in Mr. Boyle’s laboratory. These were\r\nput into a crucible, which was then placed in a melting-furnace. As\r\nsoon as these metals were fused, the stranger showed a powder to the\r\nattendants, which he projected into the crucible, and instantly went\r\nout, directing the servants to allow the crucible to remain in the\r\nfurnace till the fire went out of its own accord, and promising at the\r\nsame time to return in a few hours. But, as he never fulfilled this\r\npromise, Boyle ordered the cover to be taken off the crucible, and\r\nfound that it contained a yellow-coloured metal, possessing all the\r\nproperties of pure gold, and only a little lighter than the weight of\r\nthe materials originally put into the crucible.[12]\r\n\r\n[12] Ibid.\r\n\r\nThe following strange story is related by Helvetius, physician to the\r\nPrince of Orange, in his Vitulus Aureus: Helvetius was a disbeliever of\r\nthe philosopher’s stone, and the universal medicine, and even turned\r\nSir Kenelm Digby’s sympathetic powder into ridicule. On the 27th of\r\nDecember, 1666, a stranger called upon him, and after conversing for\r\nsome time about a universal medicine, showed a yellow powder, which\r\nhe affirmed to be the philosopher’s stone, and at the same time five\r\nlarge plates of gold, which had been made by means of it. Helvetius\r\nearnestly entreated that he would give him a little of this powder,\r\nor at least that he would make a trial of its power; but the stranger\r\nrefused, promising however to return in six weeks. He returned\r\naccordingly, and after much entreaty he gave to Helvetius a piece of\r\nthe stone, not larger than the size of a rape-seed. When Helvetius\r\nexpressed his doubt whether so small a portion would be sufficient to\r\nconvert four grains of lead into gold, the adept broke off one half of\r\nit, and assured him that what remained was more than sufficient for the\r\npurpose. Helvetius, during the first conference, had concealed a little\r\nof the stone below his nail. This he threw into melted lead, but it was\r\nalmost all driven off in smoke, leaving only a vitreous earth. When he\r\nmentioned this circumstance, the stranger informed him that the powder\r\nmust be enclosed in wax, before it be thrown into the melted lead, lest\r\nit should be injured by the smoke of the lead. The stranger promised\r\nto return next day, and show him the method of making the projection;\r\nbut having failed to make his appearance, Helvetius, in the presence\r\nof his wife and son, put six drachms of lead into a crucible, and as\r\nsoon as it was melted he threw into it the fragment of philosopher’s\r\nstone in his possession, previously covered over with wax. The crucible\r\nwas now covered with its lid, and left for a quarter of an hour in the\r\nfire, at the end of which time he found the whole lead converted into\r\ngold. The colour was at first a deep green; being poured into a conical\r\nvessel, it assumed a blood-red colour; but when cold, it acquired the\r\ntrue tint of gold. Being examined by a goldsmith, he considered it as\r\npure gold. He requested Porelius, who had the charge of the Dutch mint,\r\nto try its value. Two drachms of it being subjected to quartation, and\r\nsolution in aqua fortis, were found to have increased in weight by two\r\nscruples. This increase was doubtless owing to the silver, which still\r\nremained enveloped in the gold, after the action of the aqua fortis.\r\nTo endeavour to separate the silver more completely, the gold was again\r\nfused with seven times its weight of antimony, and treated in the usual\r\nmanner; but no alteration took place in the weight.[13]\r\n\r\n[13] Bergmann, Opusc. iv. 121.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to relate many other similar narratives; but the\r\nthree which I have given are the best authenticated of any that I am\r\nacquainted with. The reader will observe, that they are all stated on\r\nthe authority, not of the persons who were the actors, but of others\r\nto whom they related them; and some of these, as the English bishop,\r\nperhaps not very familiar with chemical processes, and therefore liable\r\nto leave out or misstate some essential particulars. The evidence,\r\ntherefore, though the best that can be got, is not sufficient to\r\nauthenticate these wonderful stories. A little latent vanity might\r\neasily induce the narrators to suppress or alter some particulars,\r\nwhich, if known, would have stripped the statements of every thing\r\nmarvellous which they contain, and let us into the secret of the\r\norigin of the gold, which these alchymists boasted that they had\r\nfabricated. Whoever will read the statements of Paracelsus, respecting\r\nhis knowledge of the philosopher’s stone, which he applied not to the\r\nformation of gold but to medicine, or whoever will examine his formulas\r\nfor making the stone, will easily satisfy himself that Paracelsus\r\npossessed no real knowledge on the subject.[14]\r\n\r\n[14] I allude to his _Manuale sive de Lapide Philosophico Medicinali_.\r\nOpera Paracelsi, ii. 133. Folio edition. Geneva, 1658.\r\n\r\nBut to convey as precise ideas on this subject as possible, it may\r\nbe worth while to state a few of the methods by which the alchymists\r\npersuaded themselves that they could convert the baser metals into gold.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1694 an old gentleman called upon Mr. Wilson, at that time\r\na chemist in London, and informed him that at last, after forty years’\r\nsearch, he had met with an ample recompence for all his trouble and\r\nexpenses. This he confirmed with some oaths and imprecations; but,\r\nconsidering his great weakness and age, he looked upon himself as\r\nincapable to undergo the fatigues of the process. “I have here,” says\r\nhe, “a piece of sol (_gold_) that I made from silver, about four years\r\nago, and I cannot trust any man but you with so rare a secret. We will\r\nshare equally the charges and profit, which will render us wealthy\r\nenough to command the world.” The nature of the process being stated,\r\nMr. Wilson thought it not unreasonable, especially as he aimed at no\r\npeculiar advantage for himself. He accordingly put it to the trial in\r\nthe following manner:\r\n\r\n1. Twelve ounces of Japan copper were beat into thin plates, and laid\r\n_stratum super stratum_ with three ounces of flowers of sulphur, in a\r\ncrucible. It was exposed in a melting-furnace to a gentle heat, till\r\nthe sulphureous flames expired. When cold, the æs ustum (_sulphuret\r\nof copper_) was pounded, and stratified again; and this process was\r\nrepeated five times. Mr. Wilson does not inform us whether the powder\r\nwas mixed with flowers of sulphur every time that it was heated; but\r\nthis must have been the case, otherwise the sulphuret would have been\r\nagain converted into metallic copper, which would have melted into a\r\nmass. By this first process, then, bisulphuret of copper was formed,\r\ncomposed of equal weights of sulphur and copper.\r\n\r\n2. Six pounds of iron wire were put into a large glass body, and twelve\r\npounds of muriatic acid poured upon it. Six days elapsed (during which\r\nit stood in a gentle heat) before the acid was saturated with the iron.\r\nThe solution was then decanted off, and filtered, and six pounds of new\r\nmuriatic acid poured on the undissolved iron. This acid, after standing\r\na sufficient time, was decanted off, and filtered. Both liquids were\r\nput into a large retort, and distilled by a sand-heat. Towards the\r\nend, when the drops from the retort became yellow, the receiver was\r\nchanged, and the fire increased to the highest degree, in which the\r\nretort was kept between four and six hours. When all was cold, the\r\nreceiver was taken off, and a quantity of flowers was found in the neck\r\nof the retort, variously coloured, like the rainbow. The yellow liquor\r\nin the receiver weighed ten ounces and a half; the flowers (_chloride\r\nof iron_), two ounces and three drams. The liquid and flowers were put\r\ninto a clean bottle.\r\n\r\n3. Half a pound of sal enixum (_sulphate of potash_) and a pound and a\r\nhalf of nitric acid were put into a retort. When the salt had dissolved\r\nin the acid, ten ounces of mercury (previously distilled through\r\nquicklime and salt of tartar) were added. The whole being distilled to\r\ndryness, a fine yellow mass (_pernitrate of mercury_) remained in the\r\nbottom of the retort. The liquor was returned, with half a pound of\r\nfresh nitric acid, and the distillation repeated. The distillation was\r\nrepeated a third time, urging this last cohobation with the highest\r\ndegree of fire. When all was cold, a various-coloured mass was found in\r\nthe bottom of the retort: this mass was doubtless a mixture of sulphate\r\nof potash, and pernitrate of mercury, with some oxide of mercury.\r\n\r\n4. Four ounces of fine silver were dissolved in a pound of aqua fortis;\r\nto the solution was added, of the bisulphuret of copper four ounces;\r\nof the mixture of sulphate of potash, pernitrate of mercury, and oxide\r\nof mercury one ounce and a half, and of the solution of perchloride\r\nof iron two ounces and a half. When these had stood in a retort\r\ntwenty-four hours, the liquor was decanted off, and four ounces of\r\nnitric acid were poured upon the little matter that was not dissolved.\r\nNext morning a total dissolution was obtained. The whole of this\r\ndissolution was put into a retort and distilled almost to dryness. The\r\nliquid was poured back, and the distillation repeated three times; the\r\nlast time the retort being urged by a very strong fire till no fumes\r\nappeared, and not a drop fell.\r\n\r\n5. The matter left in the bottom of the retort was now put into a\r\ncrucible, all the corrosive fumes were gently evaporated, and the\r\nresidue melted down with a fluxing powder.\r\n\r\nThis process was expected to yield five ounces of pure gold; but\r\non examination the silver was the same (except the loss of half a\r\npennyweight) as when dissolved in the aqua fortis: there were indeed\r\nsome grains among the scoria, which appeared like gold, and would not\r\ndissolve in aqua fortis. No doubt they consisted of peroxide of iron,\r\nor, perhaps, persulphuret of iron.[15]\r\n\r\n[15] Wilson’s Chemistry, p. 375.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson’s alchymistical friend, not satisfied with this first\r\nfailure, insisted upon a repetition of the process, with some\r\nalteration in the method and the addition of a certain quantity\r\nof gold. The whole was accordingly gone through again; but it is\r\nunnecessary to say that no gold was obtained, or at least, the two\r\ndrams of gold employed had increased in weight by only two scruples and\r\nthirteen grains; this addition was doubtless owing to a little silver\r\nfrom which it had not been freed.[16]\r\n\r\n[16] Ibid., p. 379.\r\n\r\nI shall now give a process for making the philosopher’s stone, which\r\nwas considered by Mangetus as of great value, and on that account was\r\ngiven by him in the preface to his Bibliotheca Chemica.\r\n\r\n1. Prepare a quantity of spirit of wine, so free from water that it is\r\nwholly combustible, and so volatile that when a drop of it is let fall\r\nit evaporates before it reaches the ground;--this constitutes the first\r\nmenstruum.\r\n\r\n2. Take pure mercury, revived in the usual manner from cinnabar, put\r\nit into a glass vessel with common salt and distilled vinegar; agitate\r\nviolently, and when the vinegar acquires a black colour pour it off and\r\nadd new vinegar; agitate again, and continue these repeated agitations\r\nand additions till the vinegar ceases to acquire a black colour from\r\nthe mercury: the mercury is now quite pure and very brilliant.\r\n\r\n3. Take of this mercury four parts; of sublimed mercury[17] (_mercurii\r\nmeteoresati_), prepared with your own hands, eight parts; triturate\r\nthem together in a wooden mortar with a wooden pestle, till all the\r\ngrains of running mercury disappear. This process is tedious and rather\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n[17] Probably corrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\n4. The mixture thus prepared is to be put into an aludel, or a\r\nsand-bath, and exposed to a subliming heat, which is to be gradually\r\nraised till the whole sublimes. Collect the sublimed matter, put it\r\nagain into the aludel, and sublime a second time; this process must be\r\nrepeated five times. Thus a very sweet and crystallized sublimate is\r\nobtained: it constitutes the salt of wise men (_sal sapientum_), and\r\npossesses wonderful properties.[18]\r\n\r\n[18] Probably calomel.\r\n\r\n5. Grind it in a wooden mortar, and reduce it to powder; put it into\r\na glass retort, and pour upon it the spirit of wine (No. 1) till it\r\nstands about three finger-breadths above the powder; seal the retort\r\nhermetically, and expose it to a very gentle heat for seventy-four\r\nhours, shaking it several times a-day; then distil with a gentle heat\r\nand the spirit of wine will pass over, together with spirit of mercury.\r\nKeep this liquid in a well-stopped bottle, lest it should evaporate.\r\nMore spirit of wine is to be poured upon the residual salt, and after\r\ndigestion it must be distilled off as before; and this process must\r\nbe repeated till the whole salt is dissolved, and distilled over with\r\nthe spirit of wine. You have now performed a great work. The mercury\r\nis now rendered in some measure volatile, and it will gradually become\r\nfit to receive the tincture of gold and silver. Now return thanks to\r\nGod, who has hitherto crowned your wonderful work with success; nor\r\nis this great work involved in Cimmerian darkness, but clearer than\r\nthe sun; though preceding writers have imposed upon us with parables,\r\nhieroglyphics, fables, and enigmas.\r\n\r\n6. Take this mercurial spirit, which contains our magical steel in its\r\nbelly, put it into a glass retort, to which a receiver must be well and\r\ncarefully luted: draw off the spirit by a very gentle heat, there will\r\nremain in the bottom of the retort the quintessence or soul of mercury;\r\nthis is to be sublimed by applying a stronger heat to the retort that\r\nit may become volatile, as all the philosophers express themselves--\r\n\r\n    Si fixum solvas faciesque volare solutum,\r\n    Et volucrum figas faciet te vivere tutum.\r\n\r\nThis is our luna, our fountain, in which the king and queen may bathe.\r\nPreserve this precious quintessence of mercury, which is very volatile,\r\nin a well-shut vessel for further use.\r\n\r\n8. Let us now proceed to the operation of common gold, which we shall\r\ncommunicate clearly and distinctly, without digression or obscurity;\r\nthat from vulgar gold we may obtain our philosophical gold, just\r\nas from common mercury we obtained, by the preceding processes,\r\nphilosophical mercury.\r\n\r\nIn the name of God, then, take common gold, purified in the usual\r\nway by antimony, convert it into small grains, which must be washed\r\nwith salt and vinegar, till it be quite pure. Take one part of this\r\ngold, and pour on it three parts of the quintessence of mercury; as\r\nphilosophers reckon from seven to ten, so we also reckon our number as\r\nphilosophical, and we begin with three and one; let them be married\r\ntogether like husband and wife, to produce children of their own kind,\r\nand you will see the common gold sink and plainly dissolve. Now the\r\nmarriage is consummated; now two things are converted into one: thus\r\nthe philosophical sulphur is at hand, as the philosophers say, _the\r\nsulphur being dissolved the stone is at hand_. Take then, in the name\r\nof God, our philosophical vessel, in which the king and queen embrace\r\neach other as in a bedchamber, and leave it till the water is converted\r\ninto earth, then peace is concluded between the water and fire, then\r\nthe elements have no longer any thing contrary to each other; because,\r\nwhen the elements are converted into earth they no longer oppose each\r\nother; for in earth all elements are at rest. For the philosophers say,\r\n“When you shall have seen the water coagulate itself, think that your\r\nknowledge is true, and that your operations are truly philosophical.”\r\nThe gold is now no longer common, but ours is philosophical, on\r\naccount of our processes: at first exceedingly fixed; then exceedingly\r\nvolatile, and finally exceedingly fixed; and the whole science depends\r\nupon the change of the elements. The gold at first was a metal, now it\r\nis a sulphur, capable of converting all metals into its own sulphur.\r\nNow our tincture is wholly converted into sulphur, which possesses the\r\nenergy of curing all diseases: this is our universal medicine against\r\nall the most deplorable diseases of the human body; therefore, return\r\ninfinite thanks to Almighty God for all the good things which he has\r\nbestowed upon us.\r\n\r\n9. In this great work of ours, two modes of fermenting and projecting\r\nare wanting, without which the uninitiated will not easily follow our\r\nprocess. The mode of fermenting is as follows: Take of our sulphur\r\nabove described one part, and project it upon three parts of very\r\npure gold fused in a furnace; in a moment you will see the gold, by\r\nthe force of the sulphur, converted into a red sulphur of an inferior\r\nquality to the first sulphur; take one part of this, and project it\r\nupon three parts of fused gold, the whole will be again converted\r\ninto a sulphur, or a friable mass; mixing one part of this with three\r\nparts of gold, you will have a malleable and extensible metal. If\r\nyou find it so, well; if not add other sulphur and it will again pass\r\ninto sulphur. Now the sulphur will be sufficiently fermented, or our\r\nmedicine will be brought into a metallic nature.\r\n\r\n10. The mode of projecting is this: Take of the fermented sulphur one\r\npart, and project it upon ten parts of mercury, heated in a crucible,\r\nand you will have a perfect metal; if its colour is not sufficiently\r\ndeep, fuse it again, and add more fermented sulphur, and thus it will\r\nacquire colour. If it becomes frangible, add a sufficient quantity of\r\nmercury and it will be perfect.\r\n\r\nThus, friend, you have a description of the universal medicine, not\r\nonly for curing diseases and prolonging life, but also for transmuting\r\nall metals into gold. Give therefore thanks to Almighty God, who,\r\ntaking pity on human calamities, has at last revealed this inestimable\r\ntreasure, and made it known for the common benefit of all.[19]\r\n\r\n[19] Mangeti Bibliothecæ Chemicæ Præfatio.\r\n\r\nSuch is the formula (slightly abridged) of Carolus Musitanus, by which\r\nthe philosopher’s stone, according to him, may be formed. Compared with\r\nthe formulas of most of the alchymists, it is sufficiently plain. What\r\nthe _sublimed mercury_ is does not appear; from the process described\r\nwe should be apt to consider it as _corrosive sublimate_; on that\r\nsupposition, the sal sapientum formed in No. 5, would be calomel: the\r\nonly objection to this supposition is the process described in No. 5;\r\nfor calomel is not soluble in alcohol. The philosopher’s stone prepared\r\nby this elaborate process could hardly have been any thing else than\r\nan _amalgam of gold_; it could not have contained chloride of gold,\r\nbecause such a preparation, instead of acting medicinally, would have\r\nproved a most virulent poison. There is no doubt that amalgam of gold,\r\nif projected into melted lead or tin, and afterwards cupellated, would\r\nleave a portion of gold--all the gold of course that existed previously\r\nin the amalgam. It might therefore have been employed by impostors to\r\npersuade the ignorant that it was really the philosopher’s stone; but\r\nthe alchymists who prepared the amalgam could not be ignorant that it\r\ncontained gold.\r\n\r\nThere is another process given in the same preface of a very different\r\nnature, but too long to be transcribed here, and the nature of the\r\nprocess is not sufficiently intelligible to render an account of it of\r\nmuch consequence.[20]\r\n\r\n[20] Whoever wishes to enter more particularly into the processes for\r\nmaking the philosopher’s stone contrived by the alchymists, will find a\r\ngood deal of information on the subject in Stahl’s Fundamenta Chemiæ,\r\nvol. i. p. 219, in his chapter _De lapide philosophorum_: and Junker’s\r\nConspectus Chemiæ, vol. i. p. 604, in his tabula 28, _De transmutatione\r\nmetallorum universali_: and tabula 29, _De transmutatione metallorum\r\nparticulari_.\r\n\r\nThe preceding observations will give the reader some notion of the\r\nnature of the pursuits which occupied the alchymists: their sole\r\nobject was the preparation of a substance to which they gave the name\r\nof the philosopher’s stone, which possessed the double property of\r\nconverting the baser metals into gold, and of curing all diseases, and\r\nof preserving human life to an indefinite extent. The experiments of\r\nWilson, and the formula of Musitanus, which have been just inserted,\r\nwill give the reader some notion of the way in which they attempted\r\nto manufacture this most precious substance. Being quite ignorant of\r\nthe properties of bodies, and of their action on each other, their\r\nprocesses were guided by no scientific analogies, and one part of the\r\nlabour not unfrequently counteracted another; it would be a waste of\r\ntime, therefore, to attempt to analyze their numerous processes, even\r\nthough such an attempt could be attended with success. But in most\r\ncases, from the unintelligible terms in which their books are written,\r\nit is impossible to divine the nature of the processes by which they\r\nendeavoured to manufacture the philosopher’s stone, or the nature of\r\nthe substances which they obtained.[21]\r\n\r\n[21] Kircher, in his Mundus Subterraneus, has an article on the\r\nphilosopher’s stone, in which he examines the processes of the\r\nalchymists, points out their absurdity, and proves by irrefragable\r\narguments that no such substance had ever been obtained. Those who are\r\ncurious about alchymistical processes may consult that work.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the universality of the opinion that gold could be\r\nmade by art, there was a set of impostors who went about pretending\r\nthat they were in possession of the philosopher’s stone, and offering\r\nto communicate the secret of making it for a suitable reward. Nothing\r\nis more astonishing than that persons should be found credulous enough\r\nto be the dupes of such impostors. The very circumstance of their\r\nclaiming a reward was a sufficient proof that they were ignorant of\r\nthe secret which they pretended to reveal; for what motive could a\r\nman have for asking a reward who was in possession of a method of\r\ncreating gold at pleasure? To such a person money could be no object,\r\nas he could procure it in any quantity. Yet, strange as it may appear,\r\nthey met with abundance of dupes credulous enough to believe their\r\nasseverations, and to supply them with money to enable them to perform\r\nthe wished-for processes. The object of these impostors was either to\r\npocket the money thus furnished, or they made use of it to purchase\r\nvarious substances from which they extracted oils, acids, or similar\r\nproducts, which they were enabled to sell at a profit. To keep the\r\ndupes, who thus supplied them with the means of carrying on these\r\nprocesses, in good spirits, it was necessary to show them occasionally\r\nsmall quantities of the baser metals converted into gold; this they\r\nperformed in various ways. M. Geoffroy, senior, who had an opportunity\r\nof witnessing many of their performances, has given us an account of a\r\nnumber of their tricks. It may be worth while to state a few by way of\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\nSometimes they made use of crucibles with a false bottom; at the real\r\nbottom they put a quantity of oxide of gold or silver, this was covered\r\nwith a portion of powdered crucible, glued together by a little gummed\r\nwater or a little wax; the materials being put into this crucible, and\r\nheat applied, the false bottom disappears, the oxide of gold or silver\r\nis reduced, and at the end of the process is found at the bottom of the\r\ncrucible, and considered as the product of the operation.\r\n\r\nSometimes they make a hole in a piece of charcoal and fill it with\r\noxide of gold or silver, and stop up the mouth with a little wax; or\r\nthey soak charcoal in solutions of these metals; or they stir the\r\nmixtures in the crucible with hollow rods containing oxide of gold or\r\nsilver within, and the bottom shut with wax: by these means the gold\r\nor silver wanted is introduced during the process, and considered as a\r\nproduct of the operation.\r\n\r\nSometimes they have a solution of silver in nitric acid, or of gold\r\nin aqua regia, or an amalgam of gold or silver, which being adroitly\r\nintroduced, furnishes the requisite quantity of metal. A common\r\nexhibition was to dip nails into a liquid, and take them out half\r\nconverted into gold. The nails consisted of one-half gold, neatly\r\nsoldered to the iron, and covered with something to conceal the colour,\r\nwhich the liquid removed. Sometimes they had metals one-half gold the\r\nother half silver, soldered together, and the gold side whitened with\r\nmercury; the gold half was dipped into the transmuting liquid and then\r\nthe metal heated; the mercury was dissipated, and the gold half of the\r\nmetal appeared.[22]\r\n\r\n[22] Mem. Paris, 1722, p. 61.\r\n\r\nAs the alchymists were assiduous workmen--as they mixed all the metals,\r\nsalts, &c. with which they were acquainted, in various ways with each\r\nother, and subjected such mixtures to the action of heat in close\r\nvessels, their labours were occasionally repaid by the discovery of new\r\nsubstances, possessed of much greater activity than any with which they\r\nwere previously acquainted. In this way they were led to the discovery\r\nof sulphuric, nitric, and muriatic acids. These, when known, were made\r\nto act upon the metals; solutions of the metals were obtained, and\r\nthis gradually led to the knowledge of various metalline salts and\r\npreparations, which were introduced with considerable advantage into\r\nmedicine. Thus the alchymists, by their absurd pursuits, gradually\r\nformed a collection of facts, which led ultimately to the establishment\r\nof scientific chemistry. On this account it will be proper to notice,\r\nin this place, such of them as appeared in Europe during the darker\r\nages, and acquired the highest reputation either on account of their\r\nskill as physicians, or their celebrity as chemists.[23]\r\n\r\n[23] The original author, whom all who have given any account of the\r\nalchymists have followed, is Olaus Borrichius, in his Conspectus\r\nScriptorum Chemicorum Celebriorum. He does not inform us from what\r\nsources his information was derived.\r\n\r\n1. The first alchymist who deserves notice is Albertus Magnus, or\r\nAlbert Groot, a German, who was born, it is supposed, in the year\r\n1193, at Bollstaedt, and died in the year 1282.[24] When very young\r\nhe is said to have been so remarkable for his dulness, that he became\r\nthe jest of his acquaintances. He studied the sciences at Padua, and\r\nafterwards taught at Cologne, and finally in Paris. He travelled\r\nthrough all Germany as Provincial of the order of Dominican Monks,\r\nvisited Rome, and was made bishop of Ratisbon: but his passion for\r\nscience induced him to give up his bishopric, and return to a cloister\r\nat Cologne, where he continued till his death.\r\n\r\n[24] Sprengel’s History of Medicine, iv. 368.\r\n\r\nAlbertus was acquainted with all the sciences cultivated in his time.\r\nHe was at once a theologian, a physician, and a man of the world: he\r\nwas an astronomer and an alchymist, and even dipped into magic and\r\nnecromancy. His works are very voluminous. They were collected by Petr.\r\nJammy, and published at Leyden in twenty-one folio volumes, in 1651.\r\nHis principal alchymistical tracts are the following:\r\n\r\n  1. De Rebus Metallicis et Mineralibus.\r\n\r\n  2. De Alchymia.\r\n\r\n  3. Secretorum Tractatus.\r\n\r\n  4. Breve Compendium de Ortu Metallorum.\r\n\r\n  5. Concordantia Philosophorum de Lapide.\r\n\r\n  6. Compositum de Compositis.\r\n\r\n  7. Liber octo Capitum de Philosophorum Lapide.\r\n\r\nMost of these tracts have been inserted in the Theatrum Chemicum. They\r\nare in general plain and intelligible. In his treatise De Alchymia, for\r\nexample, he gives a distinct account of all the chemical substances\r\nknown in his time, and of the manner of obtaining them. He mentions\r\nalso the apparatus then employed by chemists, and the various processes\r\nwhich they had occasion to perform. I may notice the most remarkable\r\nfacts and opinions which I have observed in turning over these\r\ntreatises.\r\n\r\nHe was of opinion that all metals are composed of sulphur and mercury;\r\nand endeavoured to account for the diversity of metals partly by\r\nthe difference in the purity, and partly by the difference in the\r\nproportions of the sulphur and mercury of which they are composed. He\r\nthought that water existed also as a constituent of all metals.\r\n\r\nHe was acquainted with the water-bath, employed alembics for\r\ndistillation, and aludels for sublimation; and he was in the habit of\r\nemploying various lutes, the composition of which he describes.\r\n\r\nHe mentions alum and caustic alkali, and seems to have known the\r\nalkaline basis of cream of tartar. He knew the method of purifying the\r\nprecious metals by means of lead and of gold, by cementation; and\r\nlikewise the method of trying the purity of gold, and of distinguishing\r\npure from impure gold.\r\n\r\nHe mentions red lead, metallic arsenic, and liver of sulphur. He was\r\nacquainted with green vitriol and iron pyrites. He knew that arsenic\r\nrenders copper white, and that sulphur attacks all the metals except\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nIt is said by some that he was acquainted with gunpowder; but nothing\r\nindicating any such knowledge occurs in any of his writings that I have\r\nhad an opportunity of perusing.[25]\r\n\r\n[25] It is curious that Olaus Borrichius omits Albertus Magnus in the\r\nlist of alchymistical writers that he has given.\r\n\r\n2. Albertus is said to have had for a pupil, while he taught in Paris,\r\nthe celebrated Thomas Aquinas, a Dominican, who studied at Bologna,\r\nRome, and Naples, and distinguished himself still more in divinity and\r\nscholastic philosophy than in alchymy. He wrote,\r\n\r\n    1. Thesaurum Alchymiæ Secretissimum.\r\n\r\n    2. Secreta Alchymiæ Magnalia.\r\n\r\n    3. De Esse et Essentia Mineralium; and perhaps some other\r\n    works, which I have not seen.\r\n\r\nThese works, so far as I have perused them, are exceedingly obscure,\r\nand in various places unintelligible. Some of the terms still employed\r\nby modern chemists occur, for the first time, in the writings of Thomas\r\nAquinas. Thus the term _amalgam_, still employed to denote a compound\r\nof mercury with another metal, occurs in them, and I have not observed\r\nit in any earlier author.\r\n\r\n3. Soon after Albertus Magnus, flourished Roger Bacon, by far the most\r\nillustrious, the best informed, and the most philosophical of all the\r\nalchymists. He was born in 1214, in the county of Somerset. After\r\nstudying in Oxford, and afterwards in Paris, he became a cordelier\r\nfriar; and, devoting himself to philosophical investigations, his\r\ndiscoveries, notwithstanding the pains which he took to conceal them,\r\nmade such a noise, that he was accused of magic, and his brethren in\r\nconsequence threw him into prison. He died, it is said, in the year\r\n1284, though Sprengel fixes the year of his death to be 1285.\r\n\r\nHis writings display a degree of knowledge and extent of thought\r\nscarcely credible, if we consider the time when he wrote, the darkest\r\nperiod of the dark ages. In his small treatise De Mirabili Potestate\r\nArtis et Naturæ, he begins by pointing out the absurdity of believing\r\nin magic, necromancy, charms, or any of those similar opinions which\r\nwere at that time universally prevalent. He points out the various\r\nways in which mankind are deceived by jugglers, ventriloquists, &c.;\r\nmentions the advantages which physicians may derive from acting on\r\nthe imaginations of their patients by means of charms, amulets, and\r\ninfallible remedies: he affirms that many of those things which are\r\nconsidered as supernatural, are merely so because mankind in general\r\nare unacquainted with natural philosophy. To illustrate this he\r\nmentions a great number of natural phenomena, which had been reckoned\r\nmiraculous; and concludes with several secrets of his own, which he\r\naffirms to be still more extraordinary imitations of some of the most\r\nsingular processes of nature. These he delivers in the enigmatical\r\nstyle of the times; induced, as he tells us, partly by the conduct of\r\nother philosophers, partly by the propriety of the thing, and partly by\r\nthe danger of speaking too plainly.\r\n\r\nFrom an attentive perusal of his works, many of which have been\r\nprinted, it will be seen that Bacon was a great linguist, being\r\nfamiliar with Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic; and that he had perused\r\nthe most important books at that time existing in all these languages.\r\nHe was also a grammarian; he was well versed in the theory and practice\r\nof perspective; he understood the use of convex and concave glasses,\r\nand the art of making them. The camera obscura, burning-glasses, and\r\nthe powers of the telescope, were known to him. He was well versed\r\nin geography and astronomy. He knew the great error in the Julian\r\ncalendar, assigned the cause, and proposed the remedy. He understood\r\nchronology well; he was a skilful physician, and an able mathematician,\r\nlogician, metaphysician, and theologist; but it is as a chemist that\r\nhe claims our attention here. The following is a list of his chemical\r\nwritings, as given by Gmelin, the whole of which I have never had an\r\nopportunity of seeing:\r\n\r\n  1. Speculum Alchymiæ.[26]\r\n\r\n  2. Epistola de Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturæ et\r\n  de Nullitate Magiæ.\r\n\r\n  3. De Mirabili Potestate Artis et Naturæ.\r\n\r\n  4. Medulla Alchymiæ.\r\n\r\n  5. De Arte Chemiæ.\r\n\r\n  6. Breviorium Alchymiæ.\r\n\r\n  7. Documenta Alchymiæ.\r\n\r\n  8. De Alchymistarum Artibus.\r\n\r\n  9. De Secretis.\r\n\r\n  10. De Rebus Metallicis.\r\n\r\n  11. De Sculpturis Lapidum.\r\n\r\n  12. De Philosophorum Lapide.\r\n\r\n  13. Opus Majus, _or_ Alchymia Major.\r\n\r\n  14. Breviarium de Dono Dei.\r\n\r\n  15. Verbum abbreviatum de Leone Viridi.\r\n\r\n  16. Secretum Secretorum.\r\n\r\n  17. Tractatus Trium Verborum.\r\n\r\n  18. Speculum Secretorum.\r\n\r\n[26] This tract and the next, which is of considerable length, will be\r\nfound in Mangetus’s Bibliotheca Chemica Curiosa, i. 613.\r\n\r\nA number of these were collected together, and published at Frankfort\r\nin 1603, under the title of “Rogeri Baconis Angli de Arte Chemiæ\r\nScripta,” in a small duodecimo volume. The Opus Majus was published in\r\nLondon in 1733, by Dr. Jebb, in a folio volume. Several of his tracts\r\nstill continue in manuscript in the Harleian and Bodleian libraries at\r\nOxford. He considered the metals as compound of mercury and sulphur.\r\nGmelin affirms that he was aware of the peculiar nature of manganese,\r\nand that he was acquainted with bismuth; but after perusing the whole\r\nof the Speculum Alchymiæ, the third chapter of which he quotes as\r\ncontaining the facts on which he founds his opinion, I cannot find any\r\ncertain allusion either to manganese or bismuth. The term _magnesia_\r\nindeed occurs, but nothing is said respecting its nature: and long\r\nafter the time of Paracelsus, bismuth (_bisematum_) was considered as\r\nan impure kind of _lead_. That he was acquainted with the composition\r\nand properties of _gunpowder_ admits of no doubt. In the sixth chapter\r\nof his epistle De Secretis Operibus Artis et Naturæ et de Nullitate\r\nMagiæ, the following passage occurs:\r\n\r\n“For sounds like thunder, and coruscations like lightning, may be made\r\nin the air, and they may be rendered even more horrible than those of\r\nnature herself. A small quantity of matter, properly manufactured, not\r\nlarger than the human thumb, may be made to produce a horrible noise\r\nand coruscation. And this may be done many ways, by which a city or an\r\narmy may be destroyed, as was the case when Gideon and his men broke\r\ntheir pitchers and exhibited their lamps, fire issuing out of them with\r\ninestimable noise, destroyed an infinite number of the army of the\r\nMidianites.” And in the eleventh chapter of the same epistle occurs\r\nthe following passage: “Mix together saltpetre, luru vopo vir con\r\nutriet, and sulphur, and you will make thunder and lightning, if you\r\nknow the method of mixing them.” Here all the ingredients of gunpowder\r\nare mentioned except charcoal, which is doubtless concealed under the\r\nbarbarous terms _luru vopo vir con utriet_.\r\n\r\nBut though Bacon was acquainted with gunpowder, we have no evidence\r\nthat he was the inventor. How far the celebrated Greek fire,\r\nconcerning which so much has been written, was connected with\r\ngunpowder, it is impossible to say; but there is good evidence to prove\r\nthat gunpowder was known and used in China before the commencement of\r\nthe Christian era; and Lord Bacon is of opinion that the thunder and\r\nlightning and magic stated by the Macedonians to have been exhibited\r\nin Oxydrakes, when it was besieged by Alexander the Great, was nothing\r\nelse than gunpowder. Now as there is pretty good evidence that the use\r\nof gunpowder had been introduced into Spain by the Moors, at least as\r\nearly as the year 1343, and as Roger Bacon was acquainted with Arabic,\r\nit is by no means unlikely that he might have become acquainted with\r\nthe mode of making the composition, and with its most remarkable\r\nproperties, by perusing some Arabian writer, with whom we are at\r\npresent unacquainted. Barbour, in his life of Bruce, informs us that\r\nguns were first employed by the English at the battle of Werewater,\r\nwhich was fought in 1327, about forty years after the death of Bacon.\r\n\r\n    Two novelties that day they saw,\r\n    That forouth in Scotland had been nene;\r\n    Timbers for helmes was the ane\r\n    That they thought then of great beautie,\r\n    And also wonder for to see.\r\n    The other _crakys_ were of war\r\n    That they before heard never air.\r\n\r\nIn another part of the same book we have the phrase _gynnys for\r\ncrakys_, showing that the term crakys was used to denote a gun or\r\nmusket of some form or other. It is curious that the English would\r\nseem to have been the first European nation that employed gunpowder\r\nin war; they used it in the battle of Crecy, fought in 1346, when it\r\nwas unknown to the French, and it is supposed to have contributed\r\nmaterially to the brilliant victory which was obtained.\r\n\r\n4. Raymond Lully is said to have been a scholar and a friend of\r\nRoger Bacon. He was a most voluminous writer, and acquired as high a\r\nreputation as any of the alchymists. According to Mutius he was born\r\nin Majorca in the year 1235. His father was seneschal to King James\r\nthe First of Arragon. In his younger days he went into the army; but\r\nafterwards held a situation in the court of his sovereign. Devoting\r\nhimself to science he soon acquired a competent knowledge of Latin and\r\nArabic. After studying in Paris he got the degree of doctor conferred\r\nupon him. He entered into the order of Minorites, and induced King\r\nJames to establish a cloister of that order in Minorca. He afterwards\r\ntravelled through Italy, Germany, England, Portugal, Cyprus, Armenia\r\nand Palestine. He is said by Mutius to have died in the year 1315, and\r\nto have been buried in Majorca. The following epitaph is given by Olaus\r\nBorrichius as engraven on his tomb:\r\n\r\n    Raymundus Lulli, cujus pia dogmata nulli\r\n    Sunt odiosa viro, jacet hic in marmore miro\r\n    Hic M. et CC. Cum P. cœpit sine sensibus esse.\r\n\r\nM C C C in these lines denote 1300, and P which is the 15th letter of\r\nthe alphabet denotes 15, so that if this epitaph be genuine it follows\r\nthat his death took place in the year 1315.\r\n\r\nIt seems scarcely necessary to notice the story that Raymond Lully\r\nmade a present to Edward, King of England, of six millions of pieces\r\nof gold, to enable him to make war on the Saracens, which sum that\r\nmonarch employed, contrary to the intentions of the donor, in his\r\nFrench wars. This story cannot apply to Edward III., because in 1315,\r\nat the time of Raymond’s death, that monarch was only three years of\r\nage. It can scarcely apply to Edward II., who ascended the throne in\r\n1305: but who had no opportunity of making war, either on the Saracens\r\nor French, being totally occupied in opposing the intrigues of his\r\nqueen and rebellious subjects, to whom he ultimately fell a sacrifice.\r\nEdward the First made war both upon the Saracens and the French, and\r\nlived during the time of Raymond: but his wars with the Saracens were\r\nfinished before he ascended the throne, and during the whole of his\r\nreign he was too much occupied with his projected conquest of Scotland,\r\nto pay much serious attention to any French war whatever. The story,\r\ntherefore, cannot apply to any of the three Edwards, and cannot be\r\ntrue. Raymond Lully is said to have been stoned to death in Africa for\r\npreaching Christianity in the year 1315. Others will have it that he\r\nwas alive in England in the year 1332, at which time his age would have\r\nbeen 97.\r\n\r\nThe following table exhibits a list of his numerous writings, most of\r\nwhich are to be found in the Theatrum Chemicum, the Artis Auriferæ, or\r\nthe Biblotheca Chemica.\r\n\r\n  1. Praxis Universalis Magni Operis.\r\n\r\n  2. Clavicula.\r\n\r\n  3. Theoria et Practica.\r\n\r\n  4. Compendium Animæ Transmutationis Artis Metallorum.\r\n\r\n  5. Ultimum Testamentum. Of this work, which\r\n  professes to give the whole doctrine of alchymy, there\r\n  is an English translation.\r\n\r\n  6. Elucidatio Testamenti.\r\n\r\n  7. Potestas Divitiorum cum Expositione Testamenti\r\n  Hermetis.\r\n\r\n  8. Compendium Artis Magicæ, quoad Compositionem\r\n  Lapidis.\r\n\r\n  9. De Lapide et Oleo Philosophorum.\r\n\r\n  10. Modus accipiendi Aurum Potabile.\r\n\r\n  11. Compendium Alchymiæ et Naturalis Philosophiæ.\r\n\r\n  12. Lapidarium.\r\n\r\n  13. Lux Mercuriorum.\r\n\r\n  14. Experimenta.\r\n\r\n  15. Ars Compendiosa vel Vademecum.\r\n\r\n  16. De Accurtatione Lapidis.\r\n\r\nSeveral other tracts besides these are named by Gmelin; but I have\r\nnever seen any of them. I have attempted several times to read over\r\nthe works of Raymond Lully, particularly his Last Will and Testament,\r\nwhich is considered the most important of them all. But they are all so\r\nobscure, and filled with such unintelligible jargon, that I have found\r\nit impossible to understand them. In this respect they form a wonderful\r\ncontrast with the works of Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon, which are\r\ncomparatively plain and intelligible. For an account, therefore, of\r\nthe chemical substances with which he was acquainted, I am obliged to\r\ndepend on Gmelin; though I put no great confidence in his accuracy.\r\n\r\nLike his predecessors, he was of opinion that all the metals are\r\ncompounds of sulphur and mercury. But he seems first to have introduced\r\nthose hieroglyphical figures or symbols, which appear in such profusion\r\nin the English translation of his Last Will and Testament, and which\r\nhe doubtless intended to illustrate his positions. Though what other\r\npurpose they could serve, than to induce the reader to consider his\r\nstatements as allegorical, it is not easy to conjecture. Perhaps they\r\nmay have been designed to impose upon his contemporaries by an air of\r\nsomething very profound and inexplicable. For that he possessed a good\r\ndeal of charlatanry is pretty evident, from the slightest glance at his\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\nHe was acquainted with cream of tartar, which he distilled: the\r\nresidue he burnt, and observed that the alkali extracted deliquesced\r\nwhen exposed to the air. He was acquainted with nitric acid, which he\r\nobtained by distilling a mixture of saltpetre and green vitriol. He\r\nmentions its power of dissolving, not merely mercury, but likewise\r\nother metals. He could form aqua regia by adding sal ammoniac or\r\ncommon salt to nitric acid, and he was aware of the property which it\r\nhad of dissolving gold.\r\n\r\nSpirit of wine was well known to him, and distinguished by him by\r\nthe names of aqua vitæ ardens and argentum vivum vegetabile. He knew\r\nthe method of rendering it stronger by an admixture of dry carbonate\r\nof potash, and of preparing vegetable tinctures by means of it.\r\nHe mentions alum from Rocca, marcasite, white and red mercurial\r\nprecipitate. He knew the volatile alkali and its coagulations by\r\nmeans of alcohol. He was acquainted with cupellated silver, and first\r\nobtained rosemary oil by distilling the plant with water. He employed a\r\nmixture of flour and white of egg spread upon a linen cloth to cement\r\ncracked glass vessels, and used other lutes for similar purposes.[27]\r\n\r\n[27] Gmelin’s Geschitte der Chemie, i. 74.\r\n\r\n5. Arnoldus de Villa Nova is said to have been born at Villeneuve, a\r\nvillage of Provence, about the year 1240. Olaus Borrichius assures us,\r\nthat in his time his posterity lived in the neighbourhood of Avignon;\r\nthat he was acquainted with them, and that they were by no means\r\ndestitute of chemical knowledge. He is said to have been educated at\r\nBarcelona, under John Casamila, a celebrated professor of medicine.\r\nThis place he was obliged to leave, in consequence of foretelling the\r\ndeath of Peter of Arragon. He went to Paris, and likewise travelled\r\nthrough Italy. He afterwards taught publicly in the University of\r\nMontpelier. His reputation as a physician became so great, that his\r\nattendance was solicited in dangerous cases by several kings, and\r\neven by the pope himself. He was skilled in all the sciences of his\r\ntime, and was besides a proficient in Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic. When\r\nat Paris he studied astrology, and calculating the age of the world,\r\nhe found that it was to terminate in the year 1335. The theologians\r\nof Paris exclaimed against this and several other of his opinions,\r\nand condemned our astrologer as a heretic. This obliged him to leave\r\nFrance; but the pope protected him. He died in the year 1313, on his\r\nway to visit Pope Clement V. who lay sick at Avignon. The following\r\ntable exhibits a pretty full list of his works:\r\n\r\n  1. Antidotorium\r\n\r\n  2. De Vinis.\r\n\r\n  3. De Aquis Laxativis.\r\n\r\n  4. Rosarius Philosophorum.\r\n\r\n  5. Lumen Novum.\r\n\r\n  6. De Sigillis.\r\n\r\n  7. Flos Florum.\r\n\r\n  8. Epistolæ super Alchymia ad Regem Neapolitanum.\r\n\r\n  9. Liber Perfectionis Magisterii.\r\n\r\n  10. Succosa Carmina.\r\n\r\n  11. Questiones de Arte Transmutationis Metallorum.\r\n\r\n  12. Testamentum.\r\n\r\n  13. Lumen Luminum.\r\n\r\n  14. Practica.\r\n\r\n  15. Speculum Alchymiæ.\r\n\r\n  16. Carmen.\r\n\r\n  17. Questiones ad Bonifacium.\r\n\r\n  18. Semita Semitæ.\r\n\r\n  19. De Lapide Philosophorum.\r\n\r\n  20. De Sanguine Humano.\r\n\r\n  21. De Spiritu Vini, Vino Antimonii et Gemmorum Viribus.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most curious of all these works is the _Rosarium_, which\r\nis intended as a complete compend of all the alchymy of his time.\r\nThe first part of it on the theory of the art is plain enough; but\r\nthe second part on the practice, which is subdivided into thirty-two\r\nchapters, and which professes to teach the art of making the\r\nphilosopher’s stone, is in many places quite unintelligible to me.\r\n\r\nHe considered, like his predecessors, mercury as a constituent of\r\nmetals, and he professed a knowledge of the philosopher’s stone,\r\nwhich he could increase at pleasure. Gold and gold-water was, in his\r\nopinion, one of the most precious of medicines. He employed mercury in\r\nmedicine. He seems to designate bismuth under the name _marcasite_. He\r\nwas in the habit of preparing oil of turpentine, oil of rosemary, and\r\nspirit of rosemary, which afterwards became famous under the name of\r\nHungary-water. These distillations were made in a glazed earthen vessel\r\nwith a glass top and helm.\r\n\r\nHis works were published at Venice in a single folio volume, in the\r\nyear 1505. There were seven subsequent editions, the last of which\r\nappeared at Strasburg in 1613.\r\n\r\n6. John Isaac Hollandus and his countryman of the same name, were\r\neither two brothers or a father and son; it is uncertain which. For\r\nvery few circumstances respecting these two laborious and meritorious\r\nmen have been handed down to posterity. They were born in the\r\nvillage of Stolk in Holland, it is supposed in the 13th century.\r\nThey certainly were after Arnoldus de Villa Nova, because they refer\r\nto him in their writings. They wrote many treatises on chemistry,\r\nremarkable, considering the time when they wrote, for clearness and\r\nprecision, describing their processes with accuracy, and even giving\r\nfigures of the instruments which they employed. This makes their books\r\nintelligible, and they deserve attention because they show that various\r\nprocesses, generally supposed of a more modern date were known to them.\r\nTheir treatises are written partly in Latin and partly in German. The\r\nfollowing list contains the names of most of them:\r\n\r\n  1. Opera Vegetabilia ad ejus alia Opera Intelligenda\r\n  Necessaria.\r\n\r\n  2. Opera Mineralia seu de Lapide Philosophico\r\n  Libri duo.\r\n\r\n  3. Tractat vom stein der Weisen.\r\n\r\n  4. Fragmenta Quædam Chemica.\r\n\r\n  5. De Triplice Ordine Elixiris et Lapidis Theorea.\r\n\r\n  6. Tractatus de Salibus et Oleis Metallorum.\r\n\r\n  7. Fragmentum de Opere Philosophorum.\r\n\r\n  8. Rariores Chemiæ Operationes.\r\n\r\n  9. Opus Saturni.\r\n\r\n  10. De Spiritu Urinæ.\r\n\r\n  11. Hand der Philosopher.\r\n\r\nOlaus Borrichius complains that their _opera mineralia_ abound with\r\nprocesses; but that they are ambiguous, and such that nothing certain\r\ncan be deduced from them even after much labour. Hence they draw on\r\nthe unwary tyro from labour to labour. I am disposed myself to draw a\r\ndifferent conclusion, from what I have read of that elaborate work.\r\nIt is true that the processes which profess to make the philosopher’s\r\nstone, are fallacious, and do not lead to the manufacture of gold,\r\nas the author intended, and expected: but it is a great deal when\r\nalchymistical processes are delivered in such intelligible language\r\nthat you know the substances employed. This enables us easily to see\r\nthe results in almost every case, and to know the new compounds which\r\nwere formed during a vain search for the philosopher’s stone. Had the\r\nother alchymists written as plainly, the absurdity of their researches\r\nwould have been sooner discovered, and thus a useless or pernicious\r\ninvestigation would have sooner terminated.\r\n\r\n7. Basil Valentine is said to have been born about the year 1394, and\r\nis, perhaps, the most celebrated of all the alchymists, if we except\r\nParacelsus. He was a Benedictine monk, at Erford, in Saxony. If we\r\nbelieve Olaus Borrichius, his writings were enclosed in the wall of\r\na church at Erford, and were discovered long after his death, in\r\nconsequence of the wall having been driven down by a thunderbolt. But\r\nthis story is not well authenticated, and is utterly improbable. Much\r\nof his time seems to have been taken up in the preparation of chemical\r\nmedicines. It was he that first introduced antimony into medicine;\r\nand it is said, though on no good authority, that he first tried the\r\neffects of antimonial medicines upon the monks of his convent, upon\r\nwhom it acted with such violence that he was induced to distinguish the\r\nmineral from which these medicines had been extracted, by the name of\r\n_antimoine_ (hostile to monks). What shows the improbability of this\r\nstory is, that the works of Basil Valentine, and in particular his\r\nCurrus triumphalis Antimonii, were written in the German language. Now\r\nthe German name for antimony is not _antimoine_, but _speissglass_. The\r\nCurrus triumphalis Antimonii was translated into Latin by Kerkringius,\r\nwho published it, with an excellent commentary, at Amsterdam, in 1671.\r\n\r\nBasil Valentine writes with almost as much virulence against the\r\nphysicians of his time, as Paracelsus himself did afterwards. As no\r\nparticulars of his life have been handed down to posterity, I shall\r\nsatisfy myself with giving a catalogue of his writings, and then\r\npointing out the most striking chemical substances with which he was\r\nacquainted.\r\n\r\nThe books which have appeared under the name of Basil Valentine, are\r\nvery numerous; but how many of them were really written by him, and how\r\nmany are supposititious, is extremely doubtful. The following are the\r\nprincipal:\r\n\r\n  1. Philosophia Occulta.\r\n\r\n  2. Tractat von naturlichen und ubernaturlichen\r\n  Dingen; auch von der ersten tinctur, Wurzel und\r\n  Geiste der Metallen.\r\n\r\n  3. Von dern grossen stein der Uhralten.\r\n\r\n  4. Vier tractatlein vom stein der Weisen.\r\n\r\n  5. Kurzer anhang und klare repetition oder Wiederholunge\r\n  vom grosen stein der Uhralten.\r\n\r\n  6. De prima Materia Lapidis Philosophici.\r\n\r\n  7. Azoth Philosophorum seu Aureliæ occultæ de\r\n  Materia Lapidis Philosophorum.\r\n\r\n  8. Apocalypsis Chemica.\r\n\r\n  9. Claves 12 Philosophiæ.\r\n\r\n  10. Practica.\r\n\r\n  11. Opus præclarum ad utrumque, quod pro Testamento\r\n  dedit Filio suo adoptivo.\r\n\r\n  12. Letztes Testament.\r\n\r\n  13. De Microcosmo.\r\n\r\n  14. Von der grosen Heimlichkeit der Welt und ihrer\r\n  Arzney.\r\n\r\n  15. Von der Wissenschaft der sieben Planeten.\r\n\r\n  16. Offenbahrung der verborgenen Handgriffe.\r\n\r\n  17. Conclusiones or Schlussreden.\r\n\r\n  18. Dialogus Fratris Alberti cum Spiritu.\r\n\r\n  19. De Sulphure et fermento Philosophorum.\r\n\r\n  20. Haliographia.\r\n\r\n  21. Triumph wagen Antimonii.\r\n\r\n  22. Einiger Weg zur Wahrheit.\r\n\r\n  23. Licht der Natur.\r\n\r\nThe only one of these works that I have read with care, is\r\nKerkringius’s translation and commentary on the Currus triumphalis\r\nAntimonii. It is an excellent book, written with clearness and\r\nprecision, and contains every thing respecting antimony that was known\r\nbefore the commencement of the 19th century. How much of this is owing\r\nto Kerkringius I cannot say, as I have never had an opportunity of\r\nseeing a copy of the original German work of Basil Valentine.\r\n\r\nBasil Valentine, like Isaac Hollandus, was of opinion that the metals\r\nare compounds of salt, sulphur, and mercury. The philosopher’s stone\r\nwas composed of the same ingredients. He affirmed, that there exists\r\na great similarity between the mode of purifying gold and curing the\r\ndiseases of men, and that antimony answers best for both. He was\r\nacquainted with arsenic, knew many of its properties, and mentions the\r\nred compound which it forms with sulphur. Zinc seems to have been known\r\nto him, and he mentions bismuth, both under its own name, and under\r\nthat of _marcasite_. He was aware that manganese was employed to render\r\nglass colourless. He mentions nitrate of mercury, alludes to corrosive\r\nsublimate, and seems to have known the red oxide of mercury. It would\r\nbe needless to specify the preparations of antimony with which he was\r\nacquainted; scarcely one was unknown to him which, even at present,\r\nexists in the European Pharmacopœias. Many of the preparations of lead\r\nwere also familiar to him. He was aware that lead gives a sweet taste\r\nto vinegar. He knew sugar of lead, litharge, yellow oxide of lead,\r\nwhite carbonate of lead; and mentions that this last preparation was\r\noften adulterated in his time. He knew the method of making green\r\nvitriol, and the double chloride of iron and ammonia. He was aware\r\nthat iron could be precipitated from its solution by potash, and that\r\niron has the property of throwing down copper. He was aware that tin\r\nsometimes contains iron, and ascribed the brittleness of Hungarian\r\niron to copper. He knew that oxides of copper gave a green colour to\r\nglass; that Hungarian silver contained gold; that gold is precipitated\r\nfrom aqua regia by mercury, in the state of an amalgam. He mentions\r\nfulminating gold. But the important facts contained in his works are\r\nso numerous, while we are so uncertain about the genuineness of the\r\nwritings themselves, that it will scarcely be worth while to proceed\r\nfurther with the catalogue.\r\n\r\nThus I have brought the history of alchymy to the time of Paracelsus,\r\nwhen it was doomed to undergo a new and important change. It will be\r\nbetter, therefore, not to pursue the history of alchymy further, but\r\nto take up the history of true chemistry; and in the first place to\r\nendeavour to determine what chemical facts were known to the Ancients,\r\nand how far the science had proceeded to develop itself before the time\r\nof Paracelsus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOF THE CHEMICAL KNOWLEDGE POSSESSED BY THE ANCIENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the assertions of Olaus Borrichius, and various other\r\nwriters who followed him on the same side, nothing is more certain\r\nthan that the ancients have left no chemical writings behind them,\r\nand that no evidence whatever exists to prove that the science of\r\nchemistry was known to them. Scientific chemistry, on the contrary,\r\ntook its origin from the collection and comparison of the chemical\r\nfacts, made known by the practice and improvement of those branches\r\nof manufactures which can only be conducted by chemical processes.\r\nThus the smelting of ores, and the reduction of the metals which\r\nthey contain, is a chemical process; because it requires, for its\r\nsuccess, the separation of certain bodies which exist in the ore\r\nchemically combined with the metals; and it cannot be done, except\r\nby the application or mixture of a new substance, having an affinity\r\nfor these substances, and capable, in consequence, of separating them\r\nfrom the metal, and thus reducing the metal to a state of purity. The\r\nmanufacture of glass, of soap, of leather, are all chemical, because\r\nthey consist of processes, by means of which bodies, having an affinity\r\nfor each other, are made to unite in chemical combination. Now I shall\r\nin this chapter point out the principal chemical manufactures that\r\nwere known to the ancients, that we may see how much they contributed\r\ntowards laying the foundation of the science. The chief sources of our\r\ninformation on this subject are the writings of the Greeks and Romans.\r\nUnfortunately the arts and manufactures stood in a very different\r\ndegree of estimation among the ancients from what they do among the\r\nmoderns. Their artists and manufacturers were chiefly slaves. The\r\ncitizens of Greece and Rome devoted themselves to politics or war. Such\r\nof them as turned their attention to learning confined themselves to\r\n_oratory_, which was the most fashionable and the most important study,\r\nor to history, or poetry. The only scientific pursuits which ever\r\nengaged their attention, were politics, ethics, and mathematics. For,\r\nunless Archimedes is to be considered as an exception, scarcely any\r\nof the numerous branches of physics and mechanical philosophy, which\r\nconstitute so great a portion of modern science, even attracted the\r\nattention of the ancients.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the contemptible light in which all mechanical\r\nemployments were viewed by the ancients, we look in vain in any of\r\ntheir writings for accurate details respecting the processes which\r\nthey followed. The only exception to this general neglect and contempt\r\nfor all the arts and trades, is Pliny the Elder, whose object, in\r\nhis natural history, was to collect into one focus, every thing that\r\nwas known at the period when he lived. His work displays prodigious\r\nreading, and a vast fund of erudition. It is to him that we are chiefly\r\nindebted for the knowledge of the chemical arts which were practised\r\nby the ancients. But the low estimation in which these arts were held,\r\nappears evident from the wonderful want of information which Pliny so\r\nfrequently displays, and the erroneous statements which he has recorded\r\nrespecting these processes. Still a great deal may be drawn from the\r\ninformation which has been collected and transmitted to us by this\r\nindefatigable natural historian.\r\n\r\nI.--The ancients were acquainted with SEVEN METALS;\r\nnamely, gold, silver, mercury, copper, iron, tin, and lead. They knew\r\nand employed various preparations of zinc, and antimony, and arsenic;\r\nthough we have no evidence that these bodies were known to them in the\r\nmetallic state.\r\n\r\n1. Gold is spoken of in the second chapter of Genesis as existing and\r\nfamiliarly known before the flood.\r\n\r\n“The name of the first is Pison; that is it which encompasseth the\r\nwhole land of Havilah, where there is gold. And the gold of that\r\nland is good: there is bdellium and the onyx-stone.” The Hebrew word\r\nfor gold, בהז (_zahav_) signifies to be clear, to shine; alluding,\r\ndoubtless, to the brilliancy of that metal. The term _gold_ occurs\r\nfrequently in the writings of Moses, and the metal must have been in\r\ncommon use among the Egyptians, when that legislator led the children\r\nof Israel out of Egypt.[28] Gold is found in the earth almost always in\r\na native state. There can be no doubt that it was much more abundant\r\non the surface of the earth, and in the beds of rivers in the early\r\nperiods of society, than it is at present: indeed this is obvious,\r\nfrom the account which Pliny gives of the numerous places in Asia and\r\nGreece, and other European countries, where gold was found in his time.\r\n\r\n[28] Exodus xi. 2--xxv. 11, 12, 13, 17, 18, 24, 25, 26--xxviii.\r\n8--xxxii. 2, &c.\r\n\r\nGold, therefore, could hardly fail to attract the attention of the\r\nvery first inhabitants of the globe; its beauty, its malleability, its\r\nindestructibility, would give it value: accident would soon discover\r\nthe possibility of melting it by heat, and thus of reducing the grains\r\nor small pieces of it found on the surface of the earth into one large\r\nmass. It would be speedily made into ornaments and utensils of various\r\nkinds, and thus gradually would come into common use. This we find\r\nto have occurred in America, when it was discovered by Columbus.\r\nThe inhabitants of the tropical parts of that vast continent were\r\nfamiliarly acquainted with gold; and in Mexico and Peru it existed in\r\ngreat abundance; indeed the natives of these countries seem to have\r\nbeen acquainted with no other metal, or at least no other metal was\r\nbrought into such general use, except silver, which in Peru was, it is\r\ntrue, still more common than gold.\r\n\r\nGold, then, was probably the first metal with which man became\r\nacquainted; and that knowledge must have preceded the commencement of\r\nhistory, since it is mentioned as a common and familiar substance in\r\nthe Book of Genesis, the oldest book in existence, of the authenticity\r\nof which we possess sufficient evidence. The period of leading the\r\nchildren of Israel out of Egypt by Moses, is generally fixed to\r\nhave been one thousand six hundred and forty-eight years before the\r\ncommencement of the Christian era. So early, then, we are certain,\r\nthat not only gold, but the other six malleable metals known to the\r\nancients, were familiar to the inhabitants of Egypt. The Greeks ascribe\r\nthe discovery of gold to the earliest of their heroes. According to\r\nPliny, it was discovered on Mount Pangæus by Cadmus, the Phœnician:\r\nbut Cadmus’s voyage into Greece was nearly coeval with the exit of\r\nthe Israelites out of Egypt, at which time we learn from Moses that\r\ngold was in common use in Egypt. All that can be meant, then, is, that\r\nCadmus first discovered gold in Greece; not that he made mankind first\r\nacquainted with it. Others say that Thoas and Eaclis, or Sol, the son\r\nof Oceanus, first found gold in Panchaia. Thoas was a contemporary\r\nof the heroes of the Trojan war, or at least was posterior to the\r\nArgonautic expedition, and consequently long posterior to Moses and the\r\ndeparture of the children of Israel from Egypt.\r\n\r\n2. Silver also was not only familiarly known to the Egyptians in\r\nthe time of Moses, but, as we learn from Genesis, was coined into\r\nmoney before Joseph was set over the land of Egypt by Pharaoh, which\r\nhappened one thousand eight hundred and seventy-two years before the\r\ncommencement of the Christian era, and consequently two hundred and\r\ntwenty-four years before the departure of the children of Israel out of\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\n“And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of\r\nEgypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which they bought; and\r\nJoseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house.”[29] The Hebrew word ףםכ\r\n(_keseph_), translated _money_, signifies silver, and was so called\r\nfrom its pale colour. Silver occurs in many other passages of the\r\nwritings of Moses.[30] The Greeks inform us, that Erichthonius the\r\nAthenian, or Ceacus, were the discoverers of silver; but both of these\r\nindividuals were long posterior to the time of Joseph.\r\n\r\n[29] Genesis xlvii. 14.\r\n\r\n[30] For example, Exodus xi. 2--xxvi. 19, 21--xxvii. 10, 11, 17, &c.\r\n\r\nSilver, like gold, occurs very frequently in the metallic state. This,\r\nno doubt, was a still more frequent occurrence in the early ages of the\r\nworld; it would therefore attract the attention of mankind as early as\r\ngold, and for the same reason. It is very ductile, very beautiful, and\r\nmuch more easily fused than gold: it would be therefore more easily\r\nreduced into masses, and formed into different utensils and ornaments\r\nthan even gold itself. The ores of it which occur in the earth are\r\nheavy, and would therefore draw the attention of even rude men to them:\r\nthey have, most of them at least, the appearance of being metallic, and\r\nthe most common of them may be reduced to the state of metallic silver,\r\nsimply by keeping them a sufficient time in fusion. Accordingly we find\r\nthat the Peruvians, before they were overrun by the Spaniards, had made\r\nthemselves acquainted with the mode of digging out and smelting the\r\nores of silver which occur in their country, and that many of their\r\nmost common utensils were made of that metal.\r\n\r\nSilver and gold approached each other nearer in value among the\r\nancients than at present: an ounce of fine gold was worth from ten\r\nto twelve ounces of fine silver, the variation depending upon the\r\naccidental relation of the supply of both metals. But after the\r\ndiscovery of America, the quantity of silver found in that continent,\r\nespecially in Mexico, was so great, compared with that of the gold\r\nfound, that silver became considerably cheaper; so that an ounce of\r\nfine gold came to be equivalent to about fourteen ounces and a half\r\nof fine silver. Of course these relative values have fluctuated a\r\nlittle according to the abundance of the supply of silver. Though the\r\nrevolution in the Spanish American colonies has considerably diminished\r\nthe supply of silver from the mines, that deficiency seems to have been\r\nsupplied by other ways, and thus the relative proportion between the\r\nvalue of gold and silver has continued nearly unaltered.\r\n\r\n3. That copper must have been known in the earliest ages of society,\r\nis sufficiently evident. It occurs frequently native, and could not\r\nfail to attract the attention of mankind, from its colour, weight, and\r\nmalleability. It would not be difficult to fuse it even in the rudest\r\nages: and when melted into masses, as it is malleable and ductile, it\r\nwould not require much skill to convert it into useful and ornamental\r\nutensils. The Hebrew word תשחנ (_nechooshat_) translated _brass_,\r\nobviously means _copper_. We have the authority of the Book of Genesis\r\nto satisfy us that copper was known before the flood, and probably as\r\nearly as either silver or gold.\r\n\r\n“And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, an instructor of every artificer\r\nin brass (_copper_) and iron.”[31]\r\n\r\n[31] Genesis iv. 22.\r\n\r\nThe word _copper_ occurs in many other passages of the writings of\r\nMoses.[32] That the Hebrew word translated _brass_ must have meant\r\ncopper is obvious, from the following passage: “Out of whose hills\r\nthou mayest dig brass.”[33] Brass does not exist in the earth, nor any\r\nore of it, it is always made artificially; it must therefore have been\r\ncopper, or an ore of copper, that was alluded to by Moses.\r\n\r\n[32] For example, Exodus xxvii. 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, 11, 17, 18, 19--xxx.\r\n18, &c. Numbers xxi. 9.\r\n\r\n[33] Deut. viii. 9.\r\n\r\nCopper must have been discovered and brought into common use long\r\nbefore iron or steel; for Homer represents his heroes of the Trojan war\r\nas armed with swords, &c. of copper. Copper itself is too soft to be\r\nmade into cutting instruments; but the addition of a little tin gives\r\nit the requisite hardness. Now we learn from the analyses of Klaproth,\r\nthat the copper swords of the ancients were actually hardened by the\r\naddition of tin.[34]\r\n\r\n[34] Beitrage, vi. 81.\r\n\r\nCopper was the metal in common use in the early part of the Roman\r\ncommonwealth. Romulus coined copper money alone. Numa established a\r\ncollege of workers in copper (_ærariorum fabrum_).[35]\r\n\r\n[35] Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxiv. 1.\r\n\r\nThe Latin word _æs_ sometimes signifies copper, and sometimes brass.\r\nIt is plain from what Pliny says on the subject, that he did not know\r\nthe difference between copper and brass; he says, that an ore of _æs_\r\noccurs in Cyprus, called _chalcitis_, where _æs_ was first discovered.\r\nHere _æs_ obviously means copper. In another place he says, that _æs_\r\nis obtained from a mineral called _cadmia_. Now from the account of\r\ncadmia by Pliny and Dioscorides, there cannot be a doubt that it is\r\nthe ore to which the moderns have given the name of _calamine_, by\r\nmeans of which brass is made. It is sometimes a silicate and sometimes\r\na carbonate of zinc; for both of these ores are confounded together\r\nunder the name of cadmia, and both are employed in the manufacture of\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\nSolinus says, that _æs_ was first made at Chalcis, a town in Eubœa.\r\nHence the Greek name, χαλκος (_chalkos_), by which copper was\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nThe proper name for brass, by which is meant an alloy of copper and\r\nzinc, was _aurichalcum_, or golden, or yellow copper. Pliny says,\r\nthat long before his time, the ore of aurichalcum was exhausted, so\r\nthat no more of that beautiful alloy was made. Are we to conclude\r\nfrom this, that there once existed an ore consisting of calamine and\r\nore of copper, mixed or united together? After the exhaustion of the\r\naurichalcum mine, the _salustianum_ became the most famous; but it soon\r\ngave place to the _livianum_, a copper-mine in Gaul, named after Livia,\r\nthe wife of Augustus. Both these mines were exhausted in the time of\r\nPliny. The _æs marianum_, or copper of Cordova, was the most celebrated\r\nin his time. This last _æs_, he says, absorbs most cadmia, and acquires\r\nthe greatest resemblance to aurichalcum. We see from this, that in\r\nPliny’s time brass was made artificially, and by a process similar to\r\nthat still followed by the moderns.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated alloy of copper among the ancients, was the _æs\r\ncorinthium_, or Corinthian copper, formed accidentally, as Pliny\r\ninforms us, during the burning of Corinth by Mummius in the year 608,\r\nafter the building of Rome, or one hundred and forty-five years before\r\nthe commencement of the Christian era. There were four kinds of it,\r\nof which Pliny gives the following description; not, however, very\r\nintelligible:\r\n\r\n  1. White. It resembled silver much in its lustre,\r\n  and contained an excess of that metal.\r\n\r\n  2. Red. In this kind there is an excess of gold.\r\n\r\n  3. In the third kind, gold, silver, and copper are\r\n  mixed in equal proportions.\r\n\r\n  4. The fourth kind is called _hepatizon_, from its\r\n  having a liver colour. It is this colour which gives it\r\n  its value.[36]\r\n\r\n[36] Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxiv. 2.\r\n\r\nCopper was put by the ancients to almost all the uses to which it is\r\nput by the moderns. One of the great sources of consumption was bronze\r\nstatues, which were first introduced into Rome after the conquest of\r\nAsia Minor. Before that time, the statues of the Romans were made of\r\nwood or stoneware. Pliny gives various formulas for making bronze for\r\nstatues. Of these it may be worth while to put down the most material.\r\n\r\n1. To new copper add a third part of old copper. To every hundred\r\npounds of this mixture, twelve pounds and a half of tin[37] are added,\r\nand the whole melted together.\r\n\r\n[37] Pliny’s phrase is _plumbum argentorium_. But that the addition was\r\ntin, and consequently that plumbum argentorium meant tin, we have the\r\nevidence of Klaproth, who analyzed several of these bronze statues, and\r\nfound them composed of copper, lead, and tin.\r\n\r\n2. Another kind of bronze for statues was formed, by melting together\r\n\r\n  100lbs. copper,\r\n   10lbs. lead,\r\n    5lbs. tin.\r\n\r\n3. Their copper-pots for boiling consisted of 100lbs. of copper, melted\r\nwith three or four pounds of tin.\r\n\r\nThe four celebrated statues of horses which, during the reign of\r\nTheodosius II. were transported from Chio to Constantinople; and, when\r\nConstantinople was taken and plundered by the Crusaders and Venetians\r\nin 1204, were sent by Martin Zeno and set up by the doge, Peter Ziani,\r\nin the portal of St. Mark; were in 1798, transported by the French\r\nto Paris; and finally, after the overthrow of Buonaparte, and the\r\nrestoration of the Bourbons in 1815, returned to Venice and placed\r\nupon their ancient pedestals. The metal of which these horses had been\r\nmade was examined by Klaproth, and found by him composed of\r\n\r\n  Copper,      993\r\n  Tin,           7\r\n              ----\r\n              1000[38]\r\n\r\n[38] Beitrage, vi. 89.\r\n\r\nKlaproth also analyzed an ancient bronze statue in one of the German\r\ncabinets, and found it composed of\r\n\r\n  Copper,      916\r\n  Tin,          75\r\n  Lead,          9\r\n              ----\r\n              1000[39]\r\n\r\n[39] Beitrage, vi. 118. The statue in question was known by the name of\r\n“The Statue of Püstrichs,” at Sondershausen.\r\n\r\nSeveral other old brass and bronze pieces of metal, very ancient, but\r\nfound in Germany, were also analyzed by Klaproth. The result of his\r\nanalyses was as follows:\r\n\r\nThe metal of which the altar of Krodo was made consisted of\r\n\r\n  Copper,       69\r\n  Zinc,         18\r\n  Lead,         13\r\n              ----\r\n               100[40]\r\n\r\n[40] Ibid., p. 127.\r\n\r\nThe emperor’s chair, which had in the eleventh century been transported\r\nfrom Harzburg to Goslar, where it still remains, was found to be\r\ncomposed of\r\n\r\n  Copper,       92·5\r\n  Tin,           5\r\n  Lead,          2·5\r\n               ----\r\n                100[41]\r\n\r\n[41] Ibid., p. 132.\r\n\r\nAnother piece of metal, which enclosed the high altar in a church in\r\nGermany, was composed of\r\n\r\n  Copper,      75\r\n  Tin,         12·5\r\n  Lead,        12·5\r\n              ----\r\n              100[42]\r\n\r\n[42] Ibid., p. 134.\r\n\r\nThese analyses, though none of them corresponds exactly with the\r\nproportions given by Pliny, confirms sufficiently his general\r\nstatement, that the bronze of the ancients employed for statues was\r\ncopper, alloyed with lead and tin.\r\n\r\nSome of the bronze statues cast by the ancients were of enormous\r\ndimensions, and show decisively the great progress which had been made\r\nby them in the art of working and casting metals. The addition of the\r\nlead and tin would not only add greatly to the hardness of the alloy,\r\nbut would at the same time render it more easily fusible. The bronze\r\nstatue of Apollo, placed in the capitol at the time of Pliny, was\r\nforty-five feet high, and cost 500 talents, equivalent to about £50,000\r\nof our money. It was brought from Apollonia, in Pontus, by Lucullus.\r\nThe famous statue of the sun at Rhodes was the work of Chares, a\r\ndisciple of Lysippus; it was ninety feet high, was twelve years in\r\nmaking, and cost 300 talents (about £30,000). It was made out of the\r\nengines of war left by Demetrius when he raised the siege of Rhodes.\r\nAfter standing fifty-six years, it was overthrown by an earthquake.\r\nIt lay on the ground 900 years, and was sold by Mauvia, king of the\r\nSaracens, to a merchant, who loaded 900 camels with the fragments of it.\r\n\r\nCopper was introduced into medicine at rather an early period of\r\nsociety, and various medicinal preparations of it are described by\r\nDioscorides and Pliny. It remains for us to notice the most remarkable\r\nof these. Pliny mentions an institution, to which he gives the name\r\nof _Seplasia_; the object of which was, to prepare medicines for the\r\nuse of medical men. It seems, therefore, to have been similar to our\r\napothecaries’ shops of the present day. Pliny reprobates the conduct of\r\nthe persons who had the charge of these Seplasiæ in his time. They were\r\nin the habit of adulterating medicines to such a degree, that nothing\r\ngood or genuine could be procured from them.[43]\r\n\r\n[43] Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxiv. 11.\r\n\r\nBoth the oxides of copper were known to the ancients, though they were\r\nnot very accurately distinguished from each other: they were known by\r\nthe names _flos æris_ and _scoria æris_, or _squama æris_. They were\r\nobtained by heating bars of copper red-hot and letting them cool,\r\nexposed to the air. What fell off during the cooling was the _flos_,\r\nwhat was driven off by blows of a hammer was the _squama_ or _scoria\r\næris_. It is obvious, that all these substances were nearly of the same\r\nnature, and that they were in reality mixtures of the black and red\r\noxides of copper.\r\n\r\n_Stomoma_ seems also to have been an oxide of copper, which was\r\ngradually formed upon the surface of the metal, when it was kept in a\r\nstate of fusion.\r\n\r\nThese oxides of copper were used as external applications in cases of\r\npolypi of the nose, diseases of the anus, ear, mouth, &c., seemingly as\r\nescharotics.\r\n\r\n_Ærugo_, verdigris, was a subacetate of copper, doubtless often mixed\r\nwith subacetate of zinc, as not only copper but brass also was used for\r\npreparing it. The mode of preparing this substance was similar to the\r\nprocess still followed. Whether verdigris was employed as a paint by\r\nthe ancients does not appear; for Pliny takes no notice of any such use\r\nof it.\r\n\r\n_Chalcantum_, called also _atramentum sutorium_, was probably a mixture\r\nof sulphate of copper and sulphate of iron. Pliny’s account of the\r\nmode of procuring it is too imperfect to enable us to form precise\r\nideas concerning it; but it was crystallized on strings, which were\r\nextended for the purpose in the solution: its colour was blue, and it\r\nwas transparent like glass. This description might apply to sulphate of\r\ncopper; but as the substance was used for blackening leather, and on\r\nthat account was called _atramentum sutorium_, it is obvious that it\r\nmust have contained also _sulphate of iron_.\r\n\r\n_Chalcitis_ was the name for an ore of copper. The account given of it\r\nby Pliny agrees best with copper pyrites, which is now known to be a\r\n_sulphur salt_, composed of one atom of sulphide of copper (the acid)\r\nunited to one atom of sulphide of iron (the base). Pliny informs us,\r\nthat it is a mixture of _copper_, _misy_, and _sory_: its colour is\r\nthat of honey. By age, he says, it changes into sory. I think it most\r\nprobable that native sory, of which Pliny speaks, was sulphuret of\r\ncopper, and artificial sory sulphate of copper. The native sory is said\r\nto constitute black veins in chalcitis. Pliny’s description of misy\r\n(μισυ) best agrees with copper pyrites. Dioscorides describes it as\r\nhard, as having the colour of gold, and as shining like a star.[44] All\r\nthis agrees pretty well with copper pyrites.\r\n\r\n[44] Lib. v. c. 117.\r\n\r\n_Scoleca_ (so called because it assumed the shape of a worm) was formed\r\nby triturating alumen, carbonate of soda, and white vinegar, till the\r\nmatter became green. It was probably a mixture of sulphate of soda,\r\nacetate of soda, acetate of alumina, and acetate of copper, probably\r\nwith more or less oxide of copper, &c., depending upon the proportions\r\nof the respective constituents employed.\r\n\r\nSuch are the preparations of copper, employed by the ancients. They\r\nwere only used as external applications, partly as escharotics, and\r\npartly to induce ulcers to put on a healthy appearance. It does not\r\nappear that copper was ever used by the ancients as an internal remedy.\r\n\r\n4. Though _zinc_ in the metallic state was unknown to the ancients,\r\nyet as they knew some of its ores, and employed preparations of it\r\nin medicine, and were in the habit of alloying copper with it, and\r\nconverting it into brass, it will be proper to state here what was\r\nknown to them concerning it.\r\n\r\nPliny nowhere makes us acquainted with the process by which copper was\r\nconverted into brass, nor does he seem to have been acquainted with it;\r\nbut from several facts incidentally mentioned by him, it is obvious\r\nthat their process was similar to that which is followed at present\r\nby modern brass-makers. The copper in grains is mixed with a certain\r\nquantity of calamine (cadmia) and charcoal, and exposed for some time\r\nto a moderate heat in a covered crucible. The calamine is reduced to\r\nthe metallic state, and imbibed by the copper grains. When the copper\r\nis thus converted into brass, the temperature is raised sufficiently\r\nhigh to melt the whole: it is then poured out and cast into a slab or\r\ningot.\r\n\r\nThe cadmia employed by the ancients in medicine was not calamine,\r\nbut oxide of zinc, which sublimed during the fusion of brass in an\r\nopen vessel. It was distinguished by a variety of names, according to\r\nthe state in which it was obtained: the lighter portion was called\r\n_capnitis_. _Botryitis_ was the name of the portion in the interior of\r\nthe chimney: the name was derived from some resemblance which it was\r\nsupposed to have to a bunch of grapes. It had two colours, ash and red.\r\nThe red variety was reckoned best. This red colour it might derive from\r\nsome copper mixed with it, but more probably from iron; for a small\r\nquantity of oxide of iron is sufficient to give oxide of zinc a rather\r\nbeautiful red colour. The portion collected on the sides of the furnace\r\nwas called _placitis_: it constituted a crust, and was distinguished by\r\ndifferent names, according to its colour; _onychitis_ when it was blue\r\nexternally, but spotted internally: _ostracitis_, when it was black\r\nand dirty-looking. This last variety was considered as an excellent\r\napplication to wounds. The best cadmia in Pliny’s time was furnished\r\nby the furnaces of the Isle of Cyprus: it was used as an external\r\napplication in ulcers, inflammations, eruptions, &c., so that its\r\nuse in medicine was pretty much the same as at present. Sulphate and\r\nacetate of zinc were unknown to the ancients. No attempt seems to have\r\nbeen made by them to introduce any preparations of zinc as internal\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\n_Pompholyx_ was the name given to oxide of zinc, sublimed by the\r\ncombustion of the zinc which exists in brass. _Spodos_ seems to have\r\nbeen a mixture of oxides of zinc and copper. There were different\r\nvarieties of it distinguished by various names.[45]\r\n\r\n[45] See Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxiv. 13.\r\n\r\n5. Iron exists very rarely in the earth in a metallic state, but most\r\ncommonly in the state of an oxide; and the processes necessary to\r\nextract metallic iron from these ores are much more complicated, and\r\nrequire much greater skill, than the reduction of gold, silver, or\r\ncopper from their respective ores. This would lead us to expect that\r\niron would have been much longer in being discovered than the three\r\nmetals whose names have been just given. But we learn from the Book of\r\nGenesis that iron, like copper and gold, was known before the flood,\r\nTubal-cain being represented as an artificer in copper and iron.[46]\r\nThe Hebrew word for iron, לזרב (_barzel_), is said to be derived from\r\nרב (_bar_), bright, לזנ (_nazal_), to melt; and would lead one to the\r\nsuspicion, that it referred to _cast_ iron rather than _malleable_\r\niron. It is possible that in these early times native iron may have\r\nexisted as well as native gold, silver, and copper; and in this way\r\nTubal-cain may have become acquainted with the existence and properties\r\nof this metal. In the time of Moses, who was learned in all the wisdom\r\nof the Egyptians, iron must have been in common use in Egypt: for\r\nhe mentions furnaces for working iron;[47] ores from which it was\r\nextracted;[48] and tells us that swords,[49] knives,[50] axes,[51]\r\nand tools for cutting stones,[52] were then made of that metal. Now\r\niron in its pure metallic state is too soft to be applied to these\r\nuses: it is obvious, therefore, that in Moses’s time, not only iron\r\nbut steel also must have been in common use in Egypt. From this we see\r\nhow much further advanced the Egyptians were than the Greeks in the\r\nknowledge of the manufacture of this most important metal: for during\r\nthe Trojan war, which was several centuries after the time of Moses,\r\nHomer represents his heroes as armed with swords of copper, hardened\r\nby tin, and as never using any weapons of iron whatever. Nay, in\r\nsuch estimation was it held, that Achilles, when he celebrated games\r\nin honour of Patrocles, proposes a ball of iron as one of his most\r\nvaluable prizes.[53]\r\n\r\n[46] Genesis iv. 22.\r\n\r\n[47] Deut. iv. 20.\r\n\r\n[48] Deut. viii. 9.\r\n\r\n[49] Numbers xxxv. 16.\r\n\r\n[50] Levit. i. 17.\r\n\r\n[51] Deut. xviii. 5.\r\n\r\n[52] Deut. xxvii. 5.\r\n\r\n[53] Iliad, lib. xxiii. l. 826.\r\n\r\n    “Then hurl’d the hero, thundering on the ground,\r\n    A mass of iron (an enormous round),\r\n    Whose weight and size the circling Greeks admire,\r\n    Rude from the furnace and but shaped by fire.\r\n    This mighty quoit Ætion wont to rear,\r\n    And from his whirling arm dismiss’d in air;\r\n    The giant by Achilles slain, he stow’d\r\n    Among his spoils this memorable load.\r\n    For this he bids those nervous artists vie\r\n    That teach the disk to sound along the sky.\r\n    Let him whose might can hurl this bowl, arise;\r\n    Who farthest hurls it, takes it as his prize:\r\n    If he be one enrich’d with large domain\r\n    Of downs for flocks and arable for grain,\r\n    Small stock of iron needs that man provide,\r\n    His hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied\r\n    From hence: nor ask the neighbouring city’s aid\r\n    For ploughshares, wheels, and all the rural trade.”\r\n\r\nThe mass of iron was large enough to supply a shepherd or a ploughman\r\nwith iron for five years. This circumstance is a sufficient proof of\r\nthe high estimation in which iron was held during the time of Homer.\r\nWere a modern poet to represent his hero as holding out a large lump\r\nof iron as a prize, and were he to represent this prize as eagerly\r\ncontended for by kings and princes, it would appear to us perfectly\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nHesiod informs us, that the knowledge of iron was brought over from\r\nPhrygia to Greece by the Dactyli, who settled in Crete during the reign\r\nof Minos I., about 1431 years before the commencement of the Christian\r\nera, and consequently about sixty years before the departure of the\r\nchildren of Israel from Egypt: and it does not appear, that in Homer’s\r\ntime, which was about five hundred years later, the art of smelting\r\niron had been so much improved, as to enable men to apply it to the\r\ncommon purposes of life, as had long before been done by the Egyptians.\r\nThe general opinion of the ancients was, that the method of smelting\r\niron ore had been brought to perfection by the Chalybes, a small\r\nnation situated near the Black Sea,[54] and that the name _chalybs_,\r\noccasionally used for steel, was derived from that people.\r\n\r\n[54] Xenophon’s Anabasis, v. 5.\r\n\r\nPliny informs us, that the ores of iron are scattered very profusely\r\nalmost every where: that they exist in Elba; that there was a mountain\r\nin Cantabria composed entirely of iron ore; and that the earth in\r\nCappadocia, when watered from a certain river, is converted into\r\niron.[55] He gives no account of the mode of smelting iron ores; nor\r\ndoes he appear to have been acquainted with the processes; for he says\r\nthat iron is reduced from its ore precisely in the same way as copper\r\nis. Now we know, that the processes for smelting copper and iron are\r\nquite different, and founded upon different principles. He says,\r\nthat in his time many different kinds of iron existed, and they were\r\n_stricturæ_, in Latin _a stringenda acie_.\r\n\r\n[55] Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxiv. 14.\r\n\r\nThat steel was well known and in common use when Pliny wrote is obvious\r\nfrom many considerations; but he seems to have had no notion of what\r\nconstituted the difference between iron and steel, or of the method\r\nemployed to convert iron into steel. In his opinion it depended upon\r\nthe nature of the water, and consisted in heating iron red-hot, and\r\nplunging it, while in that state, into certain waters. The waters at\r\nBilbilis and Turiasso, in Spain, and at Comum, in Italy, possessed this\r\nextraordinary virtue. The best steel in Pliny’s time came from China;\r\nthe next best, in point of quality, was manufactured in Parthia.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, that at Noricum steel was manufactured directly from\r\nthe ore of iron. This process was perfectly practicable, and it is said\r\nstill to be practised in certain cases.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were acquainted with the method of rendering iron, or\r\nrather steel, magnetic; as appears from a passage in the fourteenth\r\nchapter of the thirty-fourth book of Pliny. Magnetic iron was\r\ndistinguished by the name of _ferrum vivum_.\r\n\r\nWhen iron is dabbed over with alumen and vinegar it becomes like\r\ncopper, according to Pliny. Cerussa, gypsum, and liquid pitch, keep it\r\nfrom rusting. Pliny was of opinion that a method of preventing iron\r\nfrom rusting had been once known, but had been lost before his time.\r\nThe iron chains of an old bridge over the Euphrates had not rusted in\r\nPliny’s time; but a few new links, which had been added to supply the\r\nplace of some that had decayed, were become rusty.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from Pliny, that the ancients made use of something\r\nvery like _tractors_; for he says that pain in the side is relieved by\r\nholding near it the point of a dagger that has wounded a man. Water in\r\nwhich red-hot iron had been plunged was recommended as a cure for the\r\ndysentery; and the actual cautery with red-hot iron, Pliny informs us,\r\nprevents hydrophobia, when a person has been bitten by a mad dog.\r\n\r\nRust of iron and scales of iron were used by the ancients as astringent\r\nmedicines.\r\n\r\n6. Tin, also, must have been in common use in the time of Moses; for it\r\nis mentioned without any observation as one of the common metals.[56]\r\nAnd from the way in which it is spoken of by Isaiah and Ezekiel, it is\r\nobvious that it was considered as of far inferior value to silver and\r\ngold. Now tin, though the ores of it where it does occur are usually\r\nabundant, is rather a scarce metal: that is to say, there are but few\r\nspots on the face of the earth where it is known to exist. Cornwall,\r\nSpain, in the mountains of Gallicia, and the mountains which separate\r\nSaxony and Bohemia, are the only countries in Europe where tin occurs\r\nabundantly. The last of these localities has not been known for five\r\ncenturies. It was from Spain and from Britain that the ancients were\r\nsupplied with tin; for no mines of tin exist, or have ever been known\r\nto exist, in Africa or Asia, except in the East Indies. The Phœnicians\r\nwere the first nation which carried on a great trade by sea. There\r\nis evidence that at a very early period they traded with Spain and\r\nwith Britain, and that from these countries they drew their supplies\r\nof tin. It was doubtless the Phœnicians that supplied the Egyptians\r\nwith this metal. They had imbibed strongly a spirit of monopoly; and\r\nto secure the whole trade of tin they carefully concealed the source\r\nfrom which they drew that metal. Hence, doubtless, the reason why the\r\nGrecian geographers, who derived their information from the Phœnicians,\r\nrepresented the Insulæ Cassiterides, or tin islands, as a set of\r\nislands lying off the north coast of Spain. We know that in fact the\r\nScilly islands, in these early ages, yielded tin, though doubtless the\r\ngreat supply was drawn from the neighbouring province of Cornwall.\r\nIt was probably from these islands that the Greek name for _tin_ was\r\nderived (κασσιτερος). Even Pliny informs us, that in his time tin was\r\nobtained from the Cassiterides, and from Lusitania and Gallicia. It\r\noccurs, he says, in grains in alluvial soil, from which it is obtained\r\nby washing. It is in black grains, the metallic nature of which is only\r\nrecognisable by the great weight. This is a pretty accurate description\r\nof _stream tin_, which we know formerly constituted the only ore of\r\nthat metal wrought in Cornwall. He says that the ore occurs also along\r\nwith grains of gold; that it is separated from the soil by washing\r\nalong with the grains of gold, and afterwards smelted separately.\r\n\r\n[56] Numbers xxxi. 22.\r\n\r\nPliny gives no particulars about the mode of reducing the ore of tin to\r\nthe metallic state; nor is it at all likely that he was acquainted with\r\nthe process.\r\n\r\nThe Latin term for tin was _plumbum album_. _Stannum_ is also used by\r\nPliny; but it is impossible to understand the account which he gives\r\nof it. There is, he says, an ore consisting of lead, united to silver.\r\nWhen this ore is smelted, the first metal that flows out is _stannum_.\r\nWhat flows next is _silver_. What remains in the furnace is _galena_.\r\nThis being smelted, yields _lead_.\r\n\r\nWere we to admit the existence of an ore composed of lead and silver,\r\nit is obvious that no such products could be obtained by simply\r\nsmelting it.\r\n\r\nCassiteros, or tin, is mentioned by Homer; and, from the way in which\r\nthe metal is said by him to have been used, it is obvious that in his\r\ntime it bore a much higher price, and, consequently, was more valued\r\nthan at present. In his description of the breastplate of Agamemnon, he\r\nsays that it contained ten bands of steel, twelve of gold, and twenty\r\nof tin (κασσιτεροιο).[57] And in the twenty-third book of the Iliad\r\n(line 561), Achilles describes a copper breastplate surrounded with\r\nshining tin (φαεινου κασσιτεροιο). Pliny informs us, that in his time\r\ntin was adulterated by adding to it about one-third of white copper. A\r\npound of tin, when Pliny lived, cost ten denarii. Now, if we reckon a\r\ndenarius at 7¾_d._, with Dr. Arbuthnot, this would make a Roman pound\r\nof tin to cost 6_s._ 5½_d._ But, as the Roman pound was only equal to\r\nthree-fourths of our avoirdupois pound, it is plain that in the time\r\nof Pliny an avoirdupois pound of tin was worth 8_s._ 7¼_d._, which is\r\nalmost seven times the price of tin in the present day.\r\n\r\n[57] Iliad xi. 25.\r\n\r\nTin, in the time of Pliny, was used for covering the inside of copper\r\nvessels, as it is at this day. And, no doubt, the process still\r\nfollowed is of the same nature as the process used by the ancients for\r\ntinning copper. Pliny remarks, with surprise, that copper thus tinned\r\ndoes not increase in weight. Now Bayen ascertained that a copper pan,\r\nnine inches in diameter, and three inches three lines in depth, when\r\ntinned, only acquired an additional weight of twenty-one grains. These\r\nmeasures and weights are French. When we convert them into English, we\r\nhave a copper pan 9·59 inches in diameter, and 3·46 inches deep, which,\r\nwhen tinned, increased in weight 17·23 troy grains. Now the surface\r\nof the copper pan, thus tinned, was 176·468 square inches. Hence it\r\nfollows, that a square inch of copper, when tinned, increases in weight\r\nonly 0·097 grains. This increase is so small, that we may excuse Pliny,\r\nwho probably had never seen the increase of weight determined, except\r\nby means of a rude Roman statera, for concluding that there was no\r\nincrease of weight whatever.\r\n\r\nTin was employed by the ancients for mirrors: but mirrors of silver\r\nwere gradually substituted; and these in Pliny’s time had become so\r\ncommon, that they were even employed by female servants or slaves.\r\n\r\nThat Pliny’s knowledge of the properties of tin was very limited, and\r\nfar from accurate, is obvious from his assertion that _tin_ is less\r\nfusible than silver.[58] It is true that the ancients had no measure\r\nto determine the different degrees of heat; but as tin melts at a heat\r\nunder redness, while silver requires a bright red heat to bring it into\r\nfusion, a single comparative trial would have shown him which was most\r\nfusible. This trial, it is obvious, had never been made by him.\r\n\r\n[58] Lib. xxxiv. c. 17.\r\n\r\nThe ancients seem to have been ignorant of the method of tinning iron.\r\nAt least, no reference to _tin plate_ is made by Pliny, or by any other\r\nancient author, that I have had an opportunity of consulting.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from Pliny, that both copper and brass were tinned by\r\nthe Gauls at an early period. Tinned brass was called _æra coctilia_,\r\nand was so beautiful that it almost passed for silver. _Plating_ (or\r\ncovering the metal with plates of silver), was gradually substituted\r\nfor tinning; and finally _gilding_ took the place of plating. The\r\ntrappings of horses, chariots, &c., were thus ornamented. Pliny nowhere\r\ngives a description of the process of plating; but there can be little\r\ndoubt that it was similar to that at present practised. Gilding was\r\naccomplished by laying an amalgam of gold on the copper or brass, as at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n7. Lead appears also to have been in common use among the Egyptians,\r\nat the time of Moses.[59] It was distinguished among the Romans by\r\nthe name of _plumbum nigrum_. In Pliny’s time the lead-mines existed\r\nchiefly in Spain and Britain. In Britain lead was so abundant, that it\r\nwas prohibited to extract above a certain quantity in a year. The mines\r\nlay on the surface of the earth. Derbyshire was the county in which\r\nlead ores were chiefly wrought by the Romans. The rich mines in the\r\nnorth of England seem to have been unknown to them.\r\n\r\n[59] Numbers xxxi. 22.\r\n\r\nPliny was of opinion that if a lead-mine, after being exhausted, be\r\nshut up for some time, the ore will be again renewed.\r\n\r\nIn the time of Pliny leaden pipes were commonly used for conveying\r\nwater. The vulgar notion that the ancients did not know that water will\r\nalways rise in pipes as high as the source from which it proceeds, and\r\nthat it was this ignorance which led to the formation of aqueducts,\r\nis quite unfounded. Nobody can read Pliny without seeing that this\r\nimportant fact was well known in his time.\r\n\r\nSheet lead was also used in the time of Pliny, and applied to the same\r\npurposes as at present. But lead was much higher priced among the\r\nancients than it is at present. Pliny informs us that its price was to\r\nthat of tin as 7 to 10. Hence it must have sold at the rate of 6_s._\r\n0¼_d._ per pound. The present price of lead does not much exceed three\r\nhalfpence the pound. It is therefore only 1-48th part of the price\r\nwhich it bore in the time of Pliny. This difference must be chiefly\r\nowing to the improvements made by the moderns in working the mines and\r\nsmelting the ores of lead.\r\n\r\nTin, in Pliny’s time, was used as a solder for lead. For this purpose\r\nit is well adapted, as it is so much easier smelted than lead. But when\r\nhe says that lead is used also as a solder for tin, his meaning is not\r\nso clear. Probably he means an alloy of lead and tin, which, fusing at\r\na lower point than tin, may be used to solder that metal. The addition\r\nof some bismuth reduces the fusing point materially; but that metal was\r\nunknown to the ancients.\r\n\r\n_Argentarium_ is an alloy of equal parts of lead and tin. _Tertiarium_,\r\nof two parts lead and one part tin. It was used as a solder.\r\n\r\nSome preparations of lead were used by the ancients in medicine, as we\r\nknow from the description of them given us by Dioscorides and Pliny.\r\nThese preparations consisted chiefly of protoxide of lead and lead\r\nreduced to powder, and partially oxidized by triturating it with water\r\nin a mortar. They were applied to ulcers, and employed externally as\r\nastringents.\r\n\r\n_Molybdena_ was also employed in medicine. Pliny says it was the same\r\nas galena. From his description it is obvious that it was _litharge_;\r\nfor it was in scales, and was more valued the nearer its colour\r\napproached to that of gold. It was employed, as it still is, for making\r\nplasters. Pliny gives us the process for making the plaster employed by\r\nthe Roman surgeons. It was made by heating together\r\n\r\n  3 lbs. molybdena or litharge,\r\n  1 lb. wax,\r\n  3 heminæ, or 1½ pint, of olive oil.\r\n\r\nThis process is very nearly the same as the one at present followed by\r\napothecaries for making adhesive plaster.\r\n\r\n_Psimmythium_, or _cerussa_, was the same as our _white lead_. It was\r\nmade by exposing lead in sheets to the fumes of vinegar. It would seem\r\nprobable from Pliny’s account, though it is confused and inaccurate,\r\nthat the ancients were in the habit of dissolving cerussa in vinegar,\r\nand thus making an impure acetate of lead.\r\n\r\nCerussa was used in medicine. It constituted also a common white paint.\r\nAt one time, Pliny says, it was found native; but in his time all that\r\nwas used was prepared artificially.\r\n\r\n_Cerussa usta_ seems to have been nearly the same as our _red lead_. It\r\nwas formed accidentally from cerussa during the burning of the Pyræus.\r\nThe colour was purple. It was imitated at Rome by burning _silis_\r\n_marmarosus_, which was probably a variety of some of our ochres.\r\n\r\n8. Besides the metals above enumerated, the ancients were also\r\nacquainted with quicksilver. Nothing is known about the first discovery\r\nof this metal; though it obviously precedes the commencement of\r\nhistory. I am not aware that the term occurs in the writings of Moses.\r\nWe have therefore no evidence that it was known to the Egyptians at\r\nthat early period; nor do I find any allusion to it in the works of\r\nHerodotus. But this is not surprising, as that author confines himself\r\nchiefly to subjects connected with history. Dioscorides and Pliny both\r\nmention it as common in their time. Dioscorides gives a method of\r\nobtaining it by sublimation from cinnabar. It is remarkable, because\r\nit constitutes the first example of a process which ultimately led to\r\ndistillation.[60]\r\n\r\n[60] Dioscorides, lib. v. c. 110.\r\n\r\nCinnabar is also described by Theophrastus. The term _minium_ was\r\napplied to it also, till in consequence of the adulteration of cinnabar\r\nwith _red lead_, the term minium came at last to be restricted to\r\nthat preparation of lead. Theophrastus describes an artificial\r\ncinnabar, which came from the country above Ephesus. It was a shining\r\nred-coloured sand, which was collected and reduced to a fine powder\r\nby pounding it in vessels of stone. We do not know what it was. The\r\nnative cinnabar was found in Spain, and was used chiefly as a paint.\r\nDioscorides employs _minium_ as the name for what we at present call\r\ncinnabar, or bisulphuret of mercury. His cinnabar was a red paint from\r\nAfrica, produced in such small quantity that painters could scarcely\r\nprocure enough of it to answer their purposes.\r\n\r\nMercury is described by Pliny as existing native in the mines of Spain,\r\nand Dioscorides gives the process for extracting it from cinnabar. It\r\nwas employed in gilding precisely as it is by the moderns. Pliny was\r\naware of its great specific gravity, and of the readiness with which\r\nit dissolves gold. The amalgam was squeezed through leather, which\r\nseparated most of the quicksilver. When the solid amalgam remaining was\r\nheated, the mercury was driven off and pure gold remained.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from what Dioscorides says, that the properties of\r\nmercury were very imperfectly known to him. He says that it may be\r\nkept in vessels of glass, or of lead, or of tin, or of silver.[61] Now\r\nit is well known that it dissolves lead, tin, and silver with so much\r\nrapidity, that vessels of these metals, were mercury put into them,\r\nwould be speedily destroyed. Pliny’s account of quicksilver is rather\r\nobscure. It seems doubtful whether he was aware that native _argentum\r\nvivum_ and the _hydrargyrum_ extracted from cinnabar were the same.\r\n\r\n[61] Lib. v. c. 110.\r\n\r\nCinnabar was occasionally used as an external medicine; but Pliny\r\ndisapproves of it, assuring his readers that quicksilver and all its\r\npreparations are virulent poisons. No other mercurial preparations\r\nexcept cinnabar and the amalgam of mercury seem to have been known to\r\nthe ancients.[62]\r\n\r\n[62] The ancients were in the habit of extracting mercury from\r\ncinnabar, by a kind of imperfect distillation. The native mercury they\r\ncalled _argentum vivum_, that from cinnabar _hydrargyrus_. See Plinii\r\nHist. Nat. xxxiii. 8.\r\n\r\n9. The ancients were unacquainted with the metal to which we at present\r\ngive the name of _antimony_; but several of the ores of that metal, and\r\nof the products of these ores were not altogether unknown to them. From\r\nthe account of stimmi and stibium, by Dioscorides[63] and Pliny,[64]\r\nthere can be little doubt that these names were applied to the mineral\r\nnow called _sulphuret of antimony_ or crude antimony. It is found most\r\ncommonly, Pliny says, among the ores of silver, and consists of two\r\nkinds, the male and the female; the latter of which is most valued.\r\n\r\n[63] Lib. v. c. 99.\r\n\r\n[64] Lib. xxxiii. c. 6.\r\n\r\nThis pigment was known at a very early period, and employed by the\r\nAsiatic ladies in painting their eyelashes, or rather the insides of\r\ntheir eyelashes, black. Thus it is said of Jezebel, that when Jehu came\r\nto Jezreel she painted her face. The original is, _she put her eyes in\r\nsulphuret of antimony_.[65] A similar expression occurs in Ezekiel,\r\n“For whom thou didst wash thyself, paintedst thy eyes”--literally,\r\nput thy eyes in sulphuret of antimony.[66] This custom of painting\r\nthe eyes black with antimony was transferred from Asia to Greece, and\r\nwhile the Moors occupied Spain it was employed by the Spanish ladies\r\nalso. It is curious that the term _alcohol_, at present confined to\r\n_spirit of wine_, was originally applied to the powder of sulphuret of\r\nantimony.[67] The ancients were in the habit of roasting sulphuret of\r\nantimony, and thus converting it into an impure oxide. This preparation\r\nwas also called stimmi and stibium. It was employed in medicine as\r\nan external application, and was conceived to act chiefly as an\r\nastringent; Dioscorides describes the method of preparing it. We see,\r\nfrom Pliny’s account of stibium, that he did not distinguish between\r\nsulphuret of antimony and oxide of antimony.[68]\r\n\r\n[65] 2 Kings ix. 30.\r\n\r\n[66] Chap. 23. v. 40, the Vulgate has it εστιβιζω τους οφθαλμους σουo.\r\n\r\n[67] Hartmanni Praxis Chemiatrica, p. 598.\r\n\r\n[68] Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxiii. 6.\r\n\r\n9. Some of the compounds of arsenic were also known to the ancients;\r\nthough they were neither acquainted with this substance in the metallic\r\nstate, nor with its oxide; the nature of which is so violent that had\r\nit been known to them it could not have been omitted by Dioscorides and\r\nPliny.\r\n\r\nThe word σανδαραχη (_sandarache_) occurs in Aristotle, and the\r\nterm αρῥενιχον (_arrhenichon_) in Theophrastus.[69] Dioscorides\r\nuses likewise the same name with Aristotle. It was applied to a\r\nscarlet-coloured mineral, which occurs native, and is now known by the\r\nname of _realgar_. It is a compound of arsenic and sulphur. It was\r\nemployed in medicine both externally and internally, and is recommended\r\nby Dioscorides, as an excellent remedy for an inveterate cough.\r\n\r\n[69] Περι των λιθων, c. 71.\r\n\r\n_Auripigmentum_ and _arsenicum_ were names given to the native yellow\r\nsulphuret of arsenic. It was used in the same way, and considered by\r\nDioscorides and Pliny as of the same nature with realgar. But there\r\nis no reason for supposing that the ancients were acquainted with the\r\ncompositions of either of these bodies; far less that they had any\r\nsuspicion of the existence of the metal to which we at present give the\r\nname of arsenic.\r\n\r\nSuch is a sketch of the facts known to the ancients respecting metals.\r\nThey knew the six malleable metals which are still in common use, and\r\napplied them to most of the purposes to which the moderns apply them.\r\nScarcely any information has been left us of the methods employed by\r\nthem to reduce these metals from their ores. But unless the ores were\r\nof a much simpler nature than the modern ores of these metals, of which\r\nwe have no evidence, the smelting processes with which the ancients\r\nwere familiar, could scarcely have been contrived without a knowledge\r\nof the substances united with the different metals in their ores, and\r\nof the means by which these foreign bodies could be separated, and the\r\nmetals isolated from all impurities. This doubtless implied a certain\r\nquantity of chemical knowledge, which having been handed down to the\r\nmoderns, served as a foundation upon which the modern science of\r\nchemistry was gradually reared: at the same time it will be admitted\r\nthat this foundation was very slender, and would of itself have led to\r\nlittle. Most of the oxides, sulphurets, &c., and almost all the salts\r\ninto which these metallic bodies enter, were unknown to the ancients.\r\n\r\nBesides the working in metals there were some other branches of\r\nindustry practised by the ancients, so intimately connected with\r\nchemical science, that it would be improper to pass them over in\r\nsilence. The most important of these are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--COLOURS USED BY PAINTERS.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the ancient Grecian artists carried the art of\r\npainting to the highest degree of perfection, and that their paintings\r\nwere admired and sought after by the most eminent and accomplished\r\nmen of antiquity; and Pliny gives us a catalogue of a great number of\r\nfirst-rate pictures, and a historical account of a vast many celebrated\r\npainters of antiquity. In his own time, he says, the art of painting\r\nhad lost its importance, statues and tablets having came in place of\r\npictures.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of colours were employed by the ancients; namely, the florid\r\nand the austere. The florid colours, as enumerated by Pliny, were\r\n_minium_, _armenium_, _cinnaberis_, _chrysocolla_, _purpurissum_, and\r\n_indicum purpurissum_.\r\n\r\nThe word _minium_ as used by Pliny means _red lead_; though Dioscorides\r\nemploys it for bisulphuret of mercury or cinnabar.\r\n\r\n_Armenium_ was obviously an ochre, probably of a yellow or orange\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n_Cinnaberis_ was bisulphuret of mercury, which is known to have a\r\nscarlet colour. Dioscorides employs it to denote a vegetable red\r\ncolour, probably similar to the resin at present called _dragon’s\r\nblood_.\r\n\r\n_Chrysocolla_ was a green-coloured paint, and from Pliny’s description\r\nof it, could have been nothing else than carbonate of copper or\r\nmalachite.\r\n\r\n_Purpurissum_ was a _lake_, as is obvious from the account of its\r\nformation given by Pliny. The colouring matter is not specified, but\r\nfrom the term used there can be little doubt that it was the liquor\r\nfrom the shellfish that yielded the celebrated purple dye of the\r\nTyrians.\r\n\r\n_Indicum purpurissum_ was probably _indigo_. This might be implied from\r\nthe account of it given by Pliny.\r\n\r\nThe austere colours used by the ancient painters were of two kinds,\r\nnative and artificial. The native were _sinopis_, _rubrica_,\r\n_parætonium_, _melinum_, _eretria_, _auripigmentum_. The artificial\r\nwere, _ochra_, _cerussa usta_, _sandaracha_, _sandyx_, _syricum_,\r\n_atramentum_.\r\n\r\n_Sinopis_ is the red substance now known by the name of reddle, and\r\nused for marking. On that account it is sometimes called _red chalk_.\r\nIt was found in Pontus, in the Balearian islands, and in Egypt. The\r\nprice was three denarii, or 1_s._ 11¼_d._ the pound weight. The most\r\nfamous variety of _sinopis_ was from the isle of Lemnos; it was sold\r\nsealed and stamped: hence it was called _sphragis_. It was employed to\r\nadulterate minium. In medicine it was used to appease inflammation, and\r\nas an antidote to poison.\r\n\r\n_Ochre_ is merely sinopis heated in a covered vessel. The higher the\r\ntemperature to which it has been exposed the better it is.\r\n\r\n_Leucophorum_ is a compound of\r\n\r\n   6 lbs. sinopis of Pontus,\r\n  10 lbs. siris,\r\n   2 lbs. melinum,\r\n\r\ntriturated together for thirty days. It was used to make gold adhere to\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n_Rubrica_ from the name, was probably a red ochre.\r\n\r\n_Parætonium_ was a white colour, so called from a place in Egypt,\r\nwhere it was found. It was obtained also in the island of Crete, and\r\nin Cyrene. It was said to be a combination of the froth of the sea\r\nconsolidated with mud. It consisted probably of carbonate of lime. Six\r\npounds of it cost only one denarius.\r\n\r\n_Melinum_ was also a white-coloured powder found in Melos and Samos in\r\nveins. It was most probably a carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\n_Eretria_ was named from the place where it was found. Pliny gives\r\nits medical properties, but does not inform us of its colour. It is\r\nimpossible to say what it was.\r\n\r\n_Auripigmentum_ was yellow sulphuret of arsenic. It was probably but\r\nlittle used as a pigment by the ancient painters.\r\n\r\n_Cerussa usta_ was red lead.\r\n\r\n_Sandaracha_ was red sulphuret of arsenic. The pound of sandaracha cost\r\n5 as.: it was imitated by red lead. Both it and _ochra_ were found in\r\nthe island Topazos in the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n_Sandyx_ was made by torrefying equal parts of true sandaracha and\r\nsinopis. It cost half the price of sandaracha. Virgil mistook this\r\npigment for a plant, as is obvious from the following line:\r\n\r\n    Sponte sua sandix, pascentes vestiet agnos.[70]\r\n\r\n[70] Bucol. iv. 1. 45.\r\n\r\n_Siricum_ is made by mixing sinopis and sandyx.\r\n\r\n_Atramentum_ was obviously from Pliny’s account of it _lamp-black_.\r\nHe mentions ivory-black as an invention of Apelles: it was called\r\n_elephantinum_. There was a native atramentum, which had the colour of\r\nsulphur, and got a black colour artificially. It is not unlikely that\r\nit contained sulphate of iron, and that it got its black colour from\r\nthe admixture of some astringent substance.\r\n\r\nThe ink of the ancients was lamp-black mixed with water, containing\r\ngum or glue dissolved in it. _Atramentum indicum_ was the same as our\r\n_China ink_.\r\n\r\nThe _purpurissum_ was a high-priced pigment. It was made by putting\r\n_creta argentaria_ (a species of white clay) into the caldrons\r\ncontaining the ingredients for dying purple. The creta imbibed the\r\npurple colour and became _purpurissum_. The first portion of _creta_\r\nput in constituted the finest and highest-priced pigment. The portions\r\nput in afterwards became successively worse, and were, of consequence\r\nlower priced. We see, from this description, that it was a lake similar\r\nto our modern cochineal lakes.[71]\r\n\r\n[71] Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxv. 6.\r\n\r\nThat the purpurissum indicum was indigo is obvious from the statement\r\nof Pliny, that when thrown upon hot coals it gives out a beautiful\r\npurple flame. This constitutes the character of indigo. Its price in\r\nPliny’s time was ten denarii, or six shillings and five-pence halfpenny\r\nthe Roman pound; which is equivalent to 8_s._ 7⅓_d._ the avoirdupois.\r\n\r\nThough few or none of the ancient pictures have been preserved, yet\r\nseveral specimens of the colours used by them still remain in Rome and\r\nin the ruins of Herculaneum. Among others the fresco paintings, in\r\nthe baths of Titus, still remain; and as these were made for a Roman\r\nemperor, we might expect to find the most beautiful and costly colours\r\nemployed in them. These paints, and some others, were examined by Sir\r\nHumphrey Davy, in 1813, while he was in Rome. From his researches we\r\nderive some pretty accurate information respecting the colours employed\r\nby the painters of Greece and Rome.\r\n\r\n1. _Red paints._ Three different kinds of red were found in a chamber\r\nopened in 1811, in the baths of Titus, namely, a bright orange red,\r\na dull red, and a brown red. The bright orange red was _minium_, or\r\n_red lead_; the other two were merely two varieties of iron ochres.\r\nAnother still brighter red was observed on the walls; it proved, on\r\nexamination, to be _vermilion_ or _cinnabar_.\r\n\r\n2. _Yellow paints._ All the _yellows_ examined by Davy proved to be\r\n_iron ochres_, sometimes mixed with a little _red lead_. Orpiment\r\nwas undoubtedly employed, as is obvious from what Pliny says on the\r\nsubject: but Davy found no traces of it among the yellow colours which\r\nhe examined. A very deep yellow, approaching orange, which covered a\r\npiece of stucco in the ruins near the monument of Caius Cestius, proved\r\nto be protoxide of lead, or massicot, mixed with some red lead. The\r\nyellows in the Aldobrandini pictures were all ochres, and so were those\r\nin the pictures on the walls of the houses at Pompeii.\r\n\r\n3. _Blue paints._ Different shades of blues are used in the different\r\napartments of the baths of Titus, which are darker or lighter, as they\r\ncontain more or less carbonate of lime with which the blue pigment\r\nhad been mixed by the painter. This blue pigment turned out, on\r\nexamination, to be a frit composed of alkali and silica, fused together\r\nwith a certain quantity of oxide of copper. This was the colour\r\ncalled χυανος (_kyanos_) by the Greeks, and _cæruleum_ by the Romans.\r\nVitruvius gives the method of preparing it by heating strongly together\r\nsand, carbonate of soda, and filings of copper. Davy found that\r\nfifteen parts by weight of anhydrous carbonate of soda, twenty parts\r\nof powdered opaque flints, and three parts of copper filings, strongly\r\nheated together for two hours, gave a substance exactly similar to\r\nthe blue pigment of the ancients, and which, when powdered, produced\r\na fine deep blue colour. This cæruleum has the advantage of remaining\r\nunaltered even when the painting is exposed to the actions of the air\r\nand sun.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to suspect, from what Vitruvius and Pliny say, that\r\nglass rendered blue by means of cobalt constituted the basis of some\r\nof the blue pigments of the ancients; but all those examined by Davy\r\nconsisted of glass tinged blue by copper, without any trace of cobalt\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n4. _Green paints._ All the green paints examined by Davy proved to be\r\ncarbonates of copper, more or less mixed with carbonate of lime. I have\r\nalready mentioned that verdigris was known to the ancients. It was no\r\ndoubt employed by them as a pigment, though it is not probable that the\r\nacetic acid would be able to withstand the action of the atmosphere for\r\na couple of thousand years.\r\n\r\n5. _Purple paints._ Davy ascertained that the colouring matter of\r\nthe ancient purple was combustible. It did not give out the smell of\r\nammonia, at least perceptibly. There is little doubt that it was the\r\n_purpurissum_ of the ancients, or a clay coloured by means of the\r\npurple of the buccinum employed by the Syrians in the celebrated purple\r\ndye.\r\n\r\n6. _Black and brown paints._ The black paints were lamp-black: the\r\nbrowns were some of them ochres and some of them oxides of manganese.\r\n\r\n7. _White paints._ All the ancient white paints examined by Davy were\r\ncarbonates of lime.[72] We know from Pliny that white lead was employed\r\nby the ancients as a pigment; but it might probably become altered in\r\nits nature by long-continued exposure to the weather.\r\n\r\n[72] Phil. Trans. 1814, p. 97.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--GLASS.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted by some that the word which in our English Bible is\r\ntranslated crystal, means glass, in the following passage of Job: “The\r\ngold and the crystal cannot equal it.”[73] Now although the exact time\r\nwhen Job was written is not known, it is admitted on all hands to be\r\none of the oldest of the books contained in the Old Testament. There\r\nare strong reasons for believing that it existed before the time of\r\nMoses; and some go so far as to affirm that there are several allusions\r\nto it in the writings of Moses. If therefore glass were known when\r\nthe Book of Job was written, it is obvious that the discovery of it\r\npreceded the commencement of history. But even though the word used\r\nin Job should not refer to glass, there can be no doubt that it was\r\nknown at a very early period; for glass beads are frequently found\r\non the Egyptian mummies, and they are known to have been embalmed at\r\na very remote period. The first Greek author who uses the word glass\r\n(ὑαλος, _hyalos_) is Aristophanes. In his comedy of The Clouds, act ii.\r\nscene 1, in the ridiculous dialogue between Socrates and Strepsiades,\r\nthe latter announces a method which had occurred to him to pay his\r\ndebts. “You know,” says he, “the beautiful transparent stone used for\r\nkindling fire.” “Do you mean glass (τον ὕαλον, _ton hyalon_)?” replied\r\nSocrates. “I do,” was the answer. He then describes how he would\r\ndestroy the writings by means of it, and thus defraud his creditors.\r\nNow this comedy was acted about four hundred and twenty-three years\r\nbefore the beginning of the Christian era. The story related by Pliny,\r\nrespecting the discovery of this beautiful and important substance, is\r\nwell known. Some Phœnician merchants, in a ship loaded with carbonate\r\nof soda from Egypt, stopped, and went ashore on the banks of the river\r\nBelus: having nothing to support their kettles while they were dressing\r\ntheir food, they employed lumps of carbonate of soda for that purpose.\r\nThe fire was strong enough to fuse some of this soda, and to unite it\r\nwith the fine sand of the river Belus: the consequence of this was\r\nthe formation of glass.[74] Whether this story be entitled to credit\r\nor not, it is clear that the discovery must have originated in some\r\nsuch accident. Pliny’s account of the manufacture of glass, like his\r\naccount of every other manufacture, is very imperfect: but we see from\r\nit that in his time they were in the habit of making coloured glasses;\r\nthat colourless glasses were most highly prized, and that glass was\r\nrendered colourless then as it is at present, by the addition of a\r\ncertain quantity of oxide of manganese. Colourless glass was very\r\nhigh priced in Pliny’s time. He relates, that for two moderate-sized\r\ncolourless drinking-glasses the Emperor Nero paid 6000 sistertii, which\r\nis equivalent to 25_l._ of our money.\r\n\r\n[73] Job xxviii. 17.\r\n\r\n[74] Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxvi. 26.\r\n\r\nPliny relates the story of the man who brought a vessel of malleable\r\nglass to the Emperor Tiberius, and who, after dimpling it by dashing\r\nit against the floor, restored it to its original shape and beauty by\r\nmeans of a hammer; Tiberius, as a reward for this important discovery,\r\nordered the artist to be executed, in order, as he alleged, to prevent\r\ngold and silver from becoming useless. But though Pliny relates this\r\nstory, it is evident that he does not give credit to it; nor does it\r\ndeserve credit. We can assign no reason why malleable substances may\r\nnot be transparent; but all of them hitherto known are opaque. Chloride\r\nof silver, chloride of lead and iron constitute no exception, for\r\nthey are not malleable, though by peculiar contrivances they may be\r\nextended; and their transparency is very imperfect.\r\n\r\nMany specimens of the coloured glasses made by the ancients still\r\nremain, particularly the beads employed as ornaments to the Egyptian\r\nmummies. Of these ancient glasses several have been examined chemically\r\nby Klaproth, Hatchett, and some other individuals, in order to\r\nascertain the substances employed to give colour to the glass. The\r\nfollowing are the facts that have been ascertained:\r\n\r\n1. _Red glass._ This glass was opaque, and of a lively copper-red\r\ncolour. It was probably the kind of red glass to which Pliny gave the\r\nname of hæmatinon. Klaproth analyzed it, and obtained from 100 grains\r\nof it the following constituents:\r\n\r\n  Silica               71\r\n  Oxide of lead        10\r\n  Oxide of copper       7·5\r\n  Oxide of iron         1\r\n  Alumina               2·5\r\n  Lime                  1·5\r\n                      -----\r\n                       93·5[75]\r\n\r\n[75] Beitrage, vi. 140.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the deficiency was owing to the presence of an alkali. From\r\nthis analysis we see that the colouring matter of this glass was _red\r\noxide of copper_.\r\n\r\n2. _Green glass._ The colour was light verdigris-green, and the glass,\r\nlike the preceding, was opaque. The constituents from 100 grains were,\r\n\r\n  Silica                     65\r\n  Black oxide of copper      10\r\n  Oxide of lead               7·5\r\n  Oxide of iron               3·5\r\n  Lime                        6·5\r\n  Alumina                     5·5\r\n                            -----\r\n                             98·0[76]\r\n\r\n[76] Ibid., p. 142.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that both the red and green glass are composed of the\r\nsame ingredients, though in different proportions. Both owe their\r\ncolour to copper. The red glass is coloured by the red oxide of that\r\nmetal; the green by the black oxide, which forms green-coloured\r\ncompounds, with various acids, particularly with carbonic acid and with\r\nsilica.\r\n\r\n3. _Blue glass._ The variety analyzed by Klaproth had a sapphire-blue\r\ncolour, and was only translucent on the edges. The constituents from\r\n100 grains of it were,\r\n\r\n  Silica              81·5\r\n  Oxide of iron        9·5\r\n  Alumina              1·5\r\n  Oxide of copper      0·5\r\n  Lime                 0·25\r\n                      -----\r\n                      93·25[77]\r\n\r\n[77] Beitrage, p. 144.\r\n\r\nFrom this analysis it appears that the colouring matter of this glass\r\nwas oxide of iron: it was therefore analogous to the lapis lazuli, or\r\nultramarine, in its nature.\r\n\r\nDavy, as has been formerly noticed, found another blue glass, or frit,\r\ncoloured by means of copper; and he showed that the blue paint of the\r\nancients was often made from this glass, simply by grinding it to\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nKlaproth could find no cobalt in the blue glass which he examined; but\r\nDavy found the transparent blue glass vessels, which are along with\r\nthe vases, in the tombs of Magna Græcia, tinged with cobalt; and he\r\nfound cobalt in all the transparent ancient blue glasses with which\r\nMr. Millingen supplied him. The mere fusion of these glasses with\r\nalkali, and subsequent digestion of the product with muriatic acid, was\r\nsufficient to produce a sympathetic ink from them.[78] The transparent\r\nblue beads which occasionally adorn the Egyptian mummies have also been\r\nexamined, and found coloured by cobalt. The opaque glass beads are all\r\ntinged by means of oxide of copper. It is probable from this that all\r\nthe transparent blue glasses of the ancients were coloured by cobalt;\r\nyet we find no allusion to cobalt in any of the ancient authors.\r\nTheophrastus says that copper (χαλκος, _chalcos_) was used to give\r\nglass a fine colour. Is it not likely that the impure oxide of cobalt,\r\nin the state in which they used it, was confounded by them with χαλκος\r\n(_chalcos_)?\r\n\r\n[78] Phil. Trans. 1815, p. 108.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--VASA MURRHINA.\r\n\r\nThe Romans obtained from the east, and particularly from Egypt, a set\r\nof vessels which they distinguished by the name of _vasa murrhina_,\r\nand which were held by them in very high estimation. They were never\r\nlarger than to be capable of containing from about thirty-six to forty\r\ncubic inches. One of the largest size cost, in the time of Pliny, about\r\n7000_l._ Nero actually gave for one 3000_l._ They began to be known in\r\nRome about the latter days of the republic. The first six ever seen in\r\nRome were sent by Pompey from the treasures of Mithridates. They were\r\ndeposited in the temple of Jupiter in the capitol. Augustus, after\r\nthe battle of Actium, brought one of these vessels from Egypt, and\r\ndedicated it also to the gods. In Nero’s time they began to be used by\r\nprivate persons; and were so much coveted that Petronius, the favourite\r\nof that tyrant, being ordered for execution, and conceiving that his\r\ndeath was owing to a wish of Nero to get possession of a vessel of this\r\nkind which he had, broke the vessel in pieces in order to prevent Nero\r\nfrom gaining his object.\r\n\r\nThere appear to have been two kinds of these vasa murrhina; those that\r\ncame from Asia, and those that were made in Egypt. The latter were much\r\nmore common, and much lower priced than the former, as appears from\r\nvarious passages in Martial and Propertius.\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made, and much learning displayed by the\r\nmoderns to determine the nature of these celebrated vessels; but in\r\ngeneral these attempts were made by individuals too little acquainted\r\nwith chemistry and with natural history in general to qualify them\r\nfor researches of so difficult a nature. Some will have it that they\r\nconsisted of a kind of gum; others that they were made of glass;\r\nothers, of a particular kind of shell. Cardan and Scaliger assure\r\nus that they were _porcelain_ vessels; and this opinion was adopted\r\nlikewise by Whitaker, who supported it with his usual violence and\r\narrogance. Many conceive them to have been made of some precious stone,\r\nsome that they were of _obsidian_; Count de Veltheim thinks that\r\nthey were made of the Chinese _agalmatolite_, or _figure stone_; and\r\nDr. Hager conceives that they were made from the Chinese stone _yu_.\r\nBruckmann was of opinion that these vessels were made of sardonyx, and\r\nthe Abbé Winckelmann joins him in the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nPliny informs us that these vasa murrhina were formed from a species\r\nof stone dug out of the earth in Parthia, and especially in Carimania,\r\nand also in other places but little known.[79] They must have been very\r\nabundant at Rome in the time of Nero; for Pliny informs us that a man\r\nof consular rank, famous for his collection of vasa murrhina, having\r\ndied, Nero forcibly deprived his children of these vessels, and they\r\nwere so numerous that they filled the whole inside of a theatre, which\r\nNero hoped to have seen filled with Romans when he came to it to sing\r\nin public.\r\n\r\n[79] Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxvii. 2.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the value of these vessels depended on their size.\r\nSmall vessels bore but a small price, while that of large vessels was\r\nvery high; this shows us that it must have been difficult to procure a\r\nblock of the stone out of which they were cut, of a size sufficiently\r\ngreat to make a large vessel.\r\n\r\nThese vessels were so soft that an impression might be made upon them\r\nwith the teeth; for Pliny relates the story of a man of consular rank,\r\nwho drank out of one, and was so enamoured with it that he bit pieces\r\nout of the lip of the cup: “Potavit ex eo ante hos annos consularis, ob\r\namorem abraso ejus margine.” And what is singular, the value of the\r\ncup, so far from being injured by this abrasure, was augmented: “ut\r\ntamen injuria ilia pretium augeret; neque est hodie murrhini alterius\r\npræstantior indicatura.”[80] It is clear from this that the matter of\r\nthese vessels was neither rock crystal, agate, nor any precious stone\r\nwhatever, all of which are too hard to admit of an impression from the\r\nteeth of a man.\r\n\r\n[80] Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxvii. 2.\r\n\r\nThe lustre was vitreous to such a degree that the name _vitrum\r\nmurrhinum_ was given to the artificial fabric, in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe splendour was not very great, for Pliny observes, “Splendor his\r\nsine viribus nitorque verius quam splendor.”\r\n\r\nThe colours, from their depth and richness, were what gave these\r\nvessels their value and excited admiration. The principal colours were\r\npurple and white, disposed in undulating bands, and usually separated\r\nby a third band, in which the two colours being mixed, assumed the tint\r\nof flame: “Sed in pretio varietas colorum, subinde circumagentibus se\r\nmaculis in purpuram candoremque, et tertium ex utroque ignescentem,\r\nvelut per transitum coloris, purpura rubescente, aut lacte candescente.”\r\n\r\nPerfect transparency was considered as a defect, they were merely\r\ntranslucent; this we learn not merely from Pliny, but from the\r\nfollowing epigram of Martial:\r\n\r\n    Nos bibimus vitro, tu murra, Pontice: quare?\r\n    Prodat perspicuus ne duo vina calix.\r\n\r\nSome specimens, and they were the most valued, exhibited a play of\r\ncolour like the rainbow: Pliny says they were very commonly spotted\r\nwith “sales, verrucæque non eminentes, sed ut in corpore etiam\r\nplerumque sessiles.” This, no doubt, refers to foreign bodies, such as\r\ngrains of pyrites, antimony, galena, &c., which were often scattered\r\nthrough the substances of which the vessels were made.\r\n\r\nSuch are all the facts respecting the vasa murrhina to be found in the\r\nwritings of the ancients; they all apply to fluor spar, and to nothing\r\nelse; but to it they apply so accurately as to leave little doubt that\r\nthey were in reality vessels of fluor spar, similar to those at present\r\nmade in Derbyshire.[81]\r\n\r\n[81] This opinion was first formed by Baron Born, and stated in\r\nhis Catalogue of Minerals in M. E. Raab’s collection, i. 356. But\r\nthe evidences in favour of it have been brought forward with great\r\nclearness and force by M. Roziere. See Jour. de Min. xxxvi. 193.\r\n\r\nThe artificial vasa murrhina made at Thebes, in Egypt, were doubtless\r\nof glass, coloured to imitate fluor spar as much as possible, and\r\nhaving the semi-transparency which distinguishes that mineral. The\r\nimitations being imperfect, these factitious vessels were not much\r\nprized nor sought after by the Romans, they were rather distributed\r\namong the Arabians and Ethiopians, who were supplied with glass from\r\nEgypt.\r\n\r\nRock crystal is compared by Pliny with the stone from which the vasa\r\nmurrhina were made; the former, in his opinion, had been coagulated\r\nby cold, the latter by heat. Though the ancients, as we have seen,\r\nwere acquainted with the method of colouring glass, yet they prized\r\ncolourless glass highest on account of its resemblance to rock crystal;\r\ncups of it, in Pliny’s time, had supplanted those of silver and gold;\r\nNero gave for a crystal cup 150,000 sistertii, or 625_l._\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--DYEING AND CALICO-PRINTING.\r\n\r\nVery little has been handed down by the ancients respecting the\r\nprocesses of dyeing. It is evident, from Pliny, that they were\r\nacquainted with madder, and that preparations of iron were used in\r\nthe black dyes. The most celebrated dye of all, the _purple_, was\r\ndiscovered by the Tyrians about fifteen centuries before the Christian\r\nera. This colour was given by various kinds of shellfish which inhabit\r\nthe Mediterranean. Pliny divides them into two genera; the first,\r\ncomprehending the smaller species, he called _buccinum_, from their\r\nresemblance to a hunting-horn; the second, included those called\r\n_purpura_: Fabius Columna thinks that these were distinguished also by\r\nthe name of _murex_.\r\n\r\nThese shellfish yielded liquor of different shades of colour; they\r\nwere often mixed in various proportions to produce particular shades\r\nof colour. One, or at most two drops of this liquor were obtained from\r\neach fish, by extracting and opening a little reservoir placed in the\r\nthroat. To avoid this trouble, the smaller species were generally\r\nbruised whole, in a mortar; this was also frequently done with the\r\nlarge, though the other liquids of the fish must have in some degree\r\ninjured the colour. The liquor, when extracted, was mixed with a\r\nconsiderable quantity of salt to keep it from putrifying; it was then\r\ndiluted with five or six times as much water, and kept moderately hot\r\nin leaden or tin vessels, for eight or ten days, during which the\r\nliquor was often skimmed to separate all the impurities. After this,\r\nthe wool to be dyed, being first well washed, was immersed and kept\r\ntherein for five hours; then taken out, cooled, and again immersed, and\r\ncontinued in the liquor till all the colour was exhausted.[82]\r\n\r\n[82] Plinii Hist. Nat. ix. 38.\r\n\r\nTo produce particular shades of colour, carbonate of soda, urine,\r\nand a marine plant called _fucus_, were occasionally added: one of\r\nthese colours was a very dark reddish violet--“Nigrantis rosæ colore\r\nsublucens.”[83] But the most esteemed, and that in which the Tyrians\r\nparticularly excelled, resembled coagulated blood--“laus ei summa\r\nin colore sanguinis concreti, nigricans aspectu, idemque suspectu\r\nrefulgens.”[84]\r\n\r\n[83] Ibid., ix. 36.\r\n\r\n[84] Plinii Hist. Nat. ix. c. 38.\r\n\r\nPliny says that the Tyrians first dyed their wool in the liquor of the\r\npurpura, and afterwards in that of the buccinum; and it is obvious from\r\nMoses that this purple was known to the Egyptians in his time.[85]\r\nWool which had received this double Tyrian dye (_dia bapha_) was so\r\nvery costly that, in the reign of Augustus, it sold for about 36_l._\r\nthe pound. But lest this should not be sufficient to exclude all from\r\nthe use of it but those invested with the very highest dignities\r\nof the state, laws were made inflicting severe penalties, and even\r\ndeath, upon all who should presume to wear it under the dignity\r\nof an emperor. The art of dyeing this colour came at length to be\r\npractised by a few individuals only, appointed by the emperors, and\r\nhaving been interrupted about the beginning of the twelfth century all\r\nknowledge of it died away, and during several ages this celebrated\r\ndye was considered and lamented as an irrecoverable loss.[86] How it\r\nwas afterwards recovered and made known by Mr. Cole, of Bristol, M.\r\nJussieu, M. Reaumur, and M. Duhamel, would lead us too far from our\r\npresent object, were we to relate it: those who are interested in the\r\nsubject will find an historical detail in Bancroft’s work on Permanent\r\nColours, just referred to.\r\n\r\n[85] Exodus xxv. 4.\r\n\r\n[86] See Bancroft on Permanent Colours, i. 79.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to suspect that the Hebrew word translated _fine linen_\r\nin the Old Testament, and so celebrated as a production of Egypt, was\r\nin reality _cotton_, and not linen. From a curious passage in Pliny,\r\nthere is reason to believe that the Egyptians in his time, and probably\r\nlong before, were acquainted with the method of calico-printing, such\r\nas is still practised in India and the east. The following is a\r\nliteral translation of the passage in question:\r\n\r\n“There exists in Egypt a wonderful method of dyeing. The white cloth\r\nis stained in various places, not with dye stuffs, but with substances\r\nwhich have the property of absorbing (_fixing_) colours, these\r\napplications are not visible upon the cloth; but when they are dipped\r\ninto a hot caldron of the dye they are drawn out an instant after dyed.\r\nThe remarkable circumstance is, that though there be only one dye in\r\nthe vat, yet different colours appear upon the cloth; nor can the\r\ncolour be afterwards removed.”[87]\r\n\r\n[87] Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxv. 11.\r\n\r\nIt is evident enough that these substances applied were different\r\nmordants which served to fix the dye upon the cloth; the nature of\r\nthese mordants cannot be discovered, as nothing specific seems to have\r\nbeen known to Pliny. The modern mordants are solutions of alumina; of\r\nthe oxide of tin, oxide of iron, oxide of lead, &c.: and doubtless\r\nthese, or something equivalent to these, were the substances employed\r\nby the ancients. The purple dye required no mordant, it fixed itself to\r\nthe cloth in consequence of the chemical affinity which existed between\r\nthem. Whether indigo was used by the ancients as a dye does not appear,\r\nbut there can be no doubt, at least, that its use was known to the\r\nIndians at a very remote period.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, few as they are, there can be little doubt that\r\ndyeing, and even calico-printing, had made considerable progress\r\namong the ancients; and this could not have taken place without a\r\nconsiderable knowledge of colouring matters, and of the mordants by\r\nwhich these colouring matters were fixed. These facts, however, were\r\nprobably but imperfectly understood, and could not be the means of\r\nfurnishing the ancients with any accurate chemical knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--SOAP.\r\n\r\nSoap, which constitutes so important and indispensable an article in\r\nthe domestic economy of the moderns, was quite unknown to the ancient\r\ninhabitants of Asia, and even of Greece. No allusion to it occurs in\r\nthe Old Testament. In Homer, we find Nausicaa, the daughter of the King\r\nof the Phæacians, using nothing but water to wash her nuptial garments:\r\n\r\n    They seek the cisterns where Phæacian dames\r\n    Wash their fair garments in the limped streams;\r\n    Where gathering into depth from falling rills,\r\n    The lucid wave a spacious bason fills.\r\n    The mules unharness’d range beside the main,\r\n    Or crop the verdant herbage of the plain.\r\n    Then emulous the royal robes they lave,\r\n    And plunge the vestures in the cleansing wave.\r\n    _Odyssey_, vi. 1. 99.\r\n\r\nWe find, in some of the comic poets, that the Greeks were in the habit\r\nof adding wood-ashes to water to make it a better detergent. Wood-ashes\r\ncontain a certain portion of carbonate of potash, which of course would\r\nanswer as a detergent; though, from its caustic qualities, it would be\r\ninjurious to the hands of the washerwomen. There is no evidence that\r\ncarbonate of soda, the _nitrum_ of the ancients, was ever used as a\r\ndetergent; this is the more surprising, because we know from Pliny that\r\nit was employed in dyeing, and one cannot see how a solution of it\r\ncould be employed by the dyers in their processes without discovering\r\nthat it acted powerfully as a detergent.\r\n\r\nThe word _soap_ (_sapo_) occurs first in Pliny. He informs us that it\r\nwas an invention of the Gauls, who employed it to render their hair\r\nshining; that it was a compound of wood-ashes and tallow, that there\r\nwere two kinds of it, _hard_ and _soft_ (_spissus et liquidus_); and\r\nthat the best kind was made of the ashes of the beech and the fat of\r\ngoats. Among the Germans it was more employed by the men than the\r\nwomen.[88] It is curious that no allusion whatever is made by Pliny to\r\nthe use of soap as a detergent; shall we conclude from this that the\r\nmost important of all the uses of soap was unknown to the ancients?\r\n\r\n[88] Plinii Hist. Nat. xxviii. 12. The passage of Pliny is as follows:\r\n“Prodest et sapo; Gallorum hoc inventum rutilandis capillis ex sevo et\r\ncinere. Optimus fagino et caprino, duobus modis, spissus et liquidus:\r\nuterque apud Germanos majore in usu viris quam feminis.”\r\n\r\nIt was employed by the ancients as a pomatum; and, during the early\r\npart of the government of the emperors, it was imported into Rome from\r\nGermany, as a pomatum for the young Roman beaus. Beckmann is of opinion\r\nthat the Latin word _sapo_ is derived from the old German word _sepe_,\r\na word still employed by the common people of Scotland.[89]\r\n\r\n[89] Hist. of Inventions, iii. 239.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the state of soap depends upon the alkali\r\nemployed in making it. _Soda_ constitutes a _hard_ soap, and _potash_ a\r\n_soft_ soap. The ancients being ignorant of the difference between the\r\ntwo alkalies, and using wood-ashes in the preparation of it, doubtless\r\nformed soft soap. The addition of some common salt, during the boiling\r\nof the soap, would convert the soft into hard soap. As Pliny informs us\r\nthat the ancients were acquainted both with hard and soft soap, it is\r\nclear that they must have followed some such process.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--STARCH.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of starch was known to the ancients. Pliny informs us\r\nthat it was made from wheat and from _siligo_, which was probably a\r\nvariety or sub-species of wheat. The invention of starch is ascribed\r\nby Pliny to the inhabitants of the island of Chio, where in his time\r\nthe best starch was still made. Pliny’s description of the method\r\nemployed by the ancients of making starch is tolerably exact. Next to\r\nthe China starch that of Crete was most celebrated; and next to it was\r\nthe Egyptian. The qualities of starch were judged of by the weight; the\r\nlightest being always reckoned the best.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--BEER.\r\n\r\nThat the ancients were acquainted with wine is universally known. This\r\nknowledge must have been nearly coeval with the origin of society;\r\nfor we are informed in Genesis that Noah, after the flood, planted a\r\nvineyard, and made wine, and got intoxicated by drinking the liquid\r\nwhich he had manufactured.[90] Beer also is a very old manufacture.\r\nIt was in common use among the Egyptians in the time of Herodotus,\r\nwho informs us that they made use of a kind of wine made from barley,\r\nbecause no vines grew in their country.[91] Tacitus informs us, that\r\nin his time it was the drink of the Germans.[92] Pliny informs us that\r\nit was made by the Gauls, and by other nations. He gives it the name\r\nof _cerevisia_ or _cervisia_; the name obviously alluding to the grain\r\nfrom which it was made.\r\n\r\n[90] Genesis ix. 20.\r\n\r\n[91] “Oinô d’ ek kritheôn pepoiêmenô diachreontai; ou gar sphi eisi en\r\ntê chôrê ampeloi.” Euterpe chap. 77.\r\n\r\n[92] De Moribus Germanorum, c. 23. “Potui humor ex hordeo aut frumento\r\nin quandam similitudinem vini corruptus.”\r\n\r\nBut though the ancients seem acquainted with both wine and beer,\r\nthere is no evidence of their having ever subjected these liquids\r\nto distillation, and of having collected the products. This would\r\nhave furnished them with ardent spirits or alcohol, of which there\r\nis every reason to believe they were entirely ignorant. Indeed, the\r\nmethod employed by Dioscorides to obtain mercury from cinnabar, is a\r\nsufficient proof that the true process of distillation was unknown to\r\nthem. He mixed cinnabar with iron filings, put the mixture into a pot,\r\nto the top of which a cover of stoneware was luted. Heat was applied\r\nto the pot, and when the process was at an end, the mercury was found\r\nadhering to the inside of the cover. Had they been aware of the method\r\nof distilling the quicksilver ore into a receiver, this imperfect mode\r\nof collecting only a small portion of the quicksilver, separated from\r\nthe cinnabar, would never have been practised. Besides, there is not\r\nthe smallest allusion to ardent spirits, either in the writings of the\r\npoets, historians, naturalists, or medical men of ancient Greece; a\r\ncircumstance not to be accounted for had ardent spirits been known,\r\nand applied even to one-tenth of the uses to which they are put by the\r\nmoderns.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--STONEWARE.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of stoneware vessels was known at a very early period\r\nof society. Frequent allusions to the potter’s wheel occur in the Old\r\nTestament, showing that the manufacture must have been familiar to\r\nthe Jewish nation. The porcelain of the Chinese boasts of a very high\r\nantiquity indeed. We cannot doubt that the processes of the ancients\r\nwere similar to those of the moderns, though I am not aware of any\r\ntolerably accurate account of them in any ancient author whatever.\r\n\r\nMoulds of plaster of Paris were used by the ancients to take casts\r\nprecisely as at present.[93]\r\n\r\n[93] Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxv. 12.\r\n\r\nThe sand of Puzzoli was used by the Romans, as it is by the moderns, to\r\nform a mortar capable of hardening under water.\r\n\r\nPliny gives us some idea of the Roman bricks, which are known to have\r\nbeen of an excellent quality. There were three sizes of bricks used by\r\nthe Romans.\r\n\r\n1. Lydian, which were 1½ foot long and 1 foot broad.\r\n\r\n2. Tetradoron, which was a square of 16 inches each side.\r\n\r\n3. Pentadoron, which was a square, each side of which was 20 inches\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nDoron signifies the palm of the hand: of course it was equivalent to 4\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--PRECIOUS STONES AND MINERALS.\r\n\r\nPliny has given a pretty detailed description of the precious stones\r\nof the ancients; but it is not very easy to determine the specific\r\nminerals to which he alludes.\r\n\r\n1. The description of the diamond is tolerably precise. It was found in\r\nEthiopia, India, Arabia, and Macedonia. But the Macedonian diamond, as\r\nwell as the adamas cyprius and siderites, were obviously not diamonds,\r\nbut soft stones.\r\n\r\n2. The _emerald_ of the ancients (_smaragdus_) must have varied in its\r\nnature. It was a green, transparent, hard stone; and, as colour was\r\nthe criterion by which the ancients distinguished minerals and divided\r\nthem into species, it is obvious that very different minerals must\r\nhave been confounded together, under the name of emerald. Sapphire,\r\nberyl, doubtless fluor spar when green, and probably even serpentine,\r\nnephrite, and some ores of copper, seem to have occasionally got the\r\nsame name. There is no reason to believe that the _emerald_ of the\r\nmoderns was known before the discovery of America. At least it has been\r\nonly found in modern times in America. Some of the emeralds described\r\nby Pliny as losing their colour by exposure to the sun, must have been\r\nfluor spars. There is a remarkably deep and beautiful green fluor spar,\r\nmet with some years ago in the county of Durham, in one of the Weredale\r\nmines that possesses this property. The emeralds of the ancients were\r\nof such a size (13½ feet, large enough to be cut into a pillar), that\r\nwe can consider them in no other light than as a species of rock.\r\n\r\n3. Topaz of the ancients had a green colour, which is never the case\r\nwith the modern topaz. It was found in the island Topazios, in the\r\nRed Sea.[94] It is generally supposed to have been the _chrysolite_\r\nof the moderns. But Pliny mentions a statue of it six feet long. Now\r\nchrysolite never occurs in such large masses. Bruce mentions a green\r\nsubstance in an emerald island in the Red Sea, not harder than glass.\r\nMight not this be the emerald of the ancients?\r\n\r\n[94] The word topazo is said by Pliny to signify, in the language of\r\nthe Troglodytes, _to seek_.\r\n\r\n4. _Calais_, from the locality and colour was probably the Persian\r\nturquoise, as it is generally supposed to be.\r\n\r\n5. Whether the _prasius_ and _chrysoprasius_ of Pliny were the modern\r\nstones to which these names are given, we have no means of determining.\r\nIt is generally supposed that they are, and we have no evidence to the\r\ncontrary.\r\n\r\n6. The _chrysolite_ of Pliny is supposed to be our _topaz_: but we have\r\nno other evidence of this than the opinion of M. Du Tems.\r\n\r\n7. _Asteria_ of Pliny is supposed by Saussure to be our sapphire. The\r\nlustre described by Pliny agrees with this opinion. The stone is said\r\nto have been very hard and colourless.\r\n\r\n8. _Opalus_ seems to have been our _opal_. It is called, Pliny says,\r\n_pæderos_ by many, on account of its beauty. The Indians called it\r\n_sangenon_.\r\n\r\n9. _Obsidian_ was the same as the mineral to which we give that name.\r\nIt was so called because a Roman named Obsidianus first brought it from\r\nEgypt. I have a piece of obsidian, which the late Mr. Salt brought from\r\nthe locality specified by Pliny, and which possesses all the characters\r\nof that mineral in its purest state.\r\n\r\n10. _Sarda_ was the name of _carnelian_, so called because it was first\r\nfound near Sardis. The _sardonyx_ was also another name for _carnelian_.\r\n\r\n11. Onyx was a name sometimes given to a rock, _gypsum_; sometimes it\r\nwas a light-coloured _chalcedony_. The Latin name for chalcedony was\r\n_carchedonius_, so called because Carthage was the place where this\r\nmineral was exposed to sale. The Greek name for Carthage was Καρχηδων\r\n(_carchedon_).\r\n\r\n12. _Carbunculus_ was the garnet; and _anthrax_ was a name for another\r\nvariety of the same mineral.\r\n\r\n13. The _oriental amethyst_ of Pliny was probably a sapphire. The\r\nfourth species of amethyst described by Pliny, seems to have been our\r\namethyst. Pliny derives the name from α (_a_) and μυθη (_mythe_),\r\n_wine_, because it has not quite the colour of wine. But the common\r\nderivation is from α and μυθυω, _to intoxicate_, because it was used as\r\nan amulet to prevent intoxication.\r\n\r\n14. The _sapphire_ is described by Pliny as always opaque, and as unfit\r\nfor engraving on. We do not know what it was.\r\n\r\n15. The _hyacinth_ of Pliny is equally unknown. From its name it was\r\nobviously of a blue colour. Our hyacinth has a reddish-brown colour,\r\nand a great deal of hardness and lustre.\r\n\r\n16. The _cyanus_ of Pliny may have been our _cyanite_.\r\n\r\n17. _Astrios_ agrees very well, as far as the description of Pliny\r\ngoes, with the variety of felspar called _adularia_.\r\n\r\n18. _Belioculus_ seems to have been our _catseye_.\r\n\r\n19. _Lychnites_ was a violet-coloured stone, which became electric by\r\nheat. Unless it was a _blue tourmalin_, I do not know what it could be.\r\n\r\n20. The _jasper_ of the ancients was probably the same as ours.\r\n\r\n21. _Molochites_ may have been our _malachite_. The name comes from the\r\nGreek word μολοχη, _mallow_, or _marshmallow_.\r\n\r\n22. Pliny considers _amber_ as the juice of a tree concreted into a\r\nsolid form. The largest piece of it that he had ever seen weighed 13\r\nlbs. Roman weight, which is nearly equivalent to 9¾ lbs. avoirdupois.\r\n_Indian amber_, of which he speaks, was probably _copal_, or some\r\ntransparent resin. It may be dyed, he says, by means of _anchusa_ and\r\nthe _fat of kids_.\r\n\r\n23. _Lapis specularis_ was foliated sulphate of lime, or selenite.\r\n\r\n24. _Pyrites_ had the same meaning among the ancients that it has among\r\nthe moderns; at least as far as iron pyrites or bisulphuret of iron is\r\nconcerned. Pliny describes two kind of pyrites; namely, the _white_\r\n(_arsenical pyrites_), and the _yellow_ (iron pyrites). It was used for\r\nstriking fire with steel, in order to kindle tinder. Hence the name\r\n_pyrites_ or _firestone_.\r\n\r\n25. _Gagates_, from the account given of it by Pliny, was obviously\r\npit-coal or jet.\r\n\r\n26. _Marble_ had the same meaning among the ancients that it has among\r\nthe moderns. It was sawed by the ancients into slabs, and the action of\r\nthe saw was facilitated by a sand brought for the purpose from Ethiopia\r\nand the isle of Naxos. It is obvious that this sand was powdered\r\ncorundum, or emery.\r\n\r\n27. _Creta_ was a name applied by the ancients not only to chalk, but\r\nto _white clay_.\r\n\r\n28. _Melinum_ was an _oxide of iron_. Pliny gives a list of one hundred\r\nand fifty-one species of stones in the order of the alphabet. Very few\r\nof the minerals contained in this list can be made out. He gives also\r\na list of fifty-two species of stones, whose names are derived from a\r\nfancied resemblance which the stones are supposed to bear to certain\r\nparts of animals. Of these, also, very few can be made out.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.--MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe ancients seem to have been ignorant of the nature and properties\r\nof air, and of all gaseous bodies. Pliny’s account of air consists\r\nof a single sentence: “Aër densatur nubibus; furit procellis.” “Air\r\nis condensed in clouds, it rages in storms.” Nor is his description\r\nof water much more complete, since it consists only of the following\r\nphrases: “Aquæ subeunt in imbres, rigescunt in grandines, tumescunt\r\nin fluctus, præcipitantur in torrentes.”[95] “Water falls in showers,\r\ncongeals in hail, swells in waves, and rushes down in torrents.” In\r\nthe thirty-eighth chapter of the second book, indeed, he professes\r\nto treat of _air_; but the chapter contains merely an enumeration of\r\nmeteorological phenomena, without once touching upon the nature and\r\nproperties of air.\r\n\r\n[95] Plinii Hist. Nat. ii. 63.\r\n\r\nPliny, with all the philosophers of antiquity, admitted the existence\r\nof the four elements, fire, air, water, and earth; but though he\r\nenumerates these in the fifth chapter of his first book, he never\r\nattempts to explain their nature or properties. Earth, among the\r\nancients, had two meanings, namely, the planet on which we live, and\r\nthe soil upon which vegetables grow. These two meanings still exist in\r\ncommon language. The meaning afterwards given to the _term_, earth,\r\nby the chemists, did not exist in the days of Pliny, or, at least,\r\nwas unknown to him; a sufficient proof that chemistry, in his time,\r\nhad made no progress as a science; for some notions respecting the\r\nproperties and constituents of those supposed four elements must have\r\nconstituted the very foundation of scientific chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were acquainted with none of the acids which at present\r\nconstitute so numerous a tribe, except _vinegar_, or _acetic acid_;\r\nand even this acid was not known to them in a state of purity. They\r\nknew none of the saline bases, except lime, soda, and potash, and these\r\nvery imperfectly. Of course the whole tribe of salts was unknown to\r\nthem, except a very few, which they found ready formed in the earth,\r\nor which they succeeded in forming by the action of vinegar on lead\r\nand copper. Hence all that extensive and most important branch of\r\nchemistry, consisting of the combinations of the acids and bases, on\r\nwhich scientific chemistry mainly depends, must have been unknown to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSulphur occurring native in large quantities, and being remarkable for\r\nits easy combustibility, and its disagreeable smell when burning, was\r\nknown in the very earliest ages. Pliny describes four kinds of sulphur,\r\ndiffering from each other, probably, merely in their purity. These were\r\n\r\n1. Sulphur vivum, or apyron. It was dug out of the earth solid, and was\r\ndoubtless pure, or nearly so. It alone was used in medicine.\r\n\r\n2. Gleba--used only by fullers.\r\n\r\n3. Egula--used also by fullers.\r\n\r\nPliny says, it renders woollen stuffs white and soft. It is obvious\r\nfrom this, that the ancients knew the method of bleaching flannel by\r\nthe fumes of sulphur, as practised by the moderns.\r\n\r\n4. The fourth kind was used only for sulphuring matches.\r\n\r\nSulphur, in Pliny’s time, was found native in the Æolian islands, and\r\nin Campania. It is curious that he never mentions Sicily, whence the\r\ngreat supply is drawn for modern manufacture.\r\n\r\nIn medicine, it seems to have been only used externally by the\r\nancients. It was considered as excellent for removing eruptions. It was\r\nused also for fumigating.\r\n\r\nThe word _alumen_, which we translate _alum_, occurs often in Pliny;\r\nand is the same substance which the Greeks distinguished by the\r\nname of στυπτηρια (_stypteria_). It is described pretty minutely by\r\nDioscorides, and also by Pliny. It was obviously a natural production,\r\ndug out of the earth, and consequently quite different from our alum,\r\nwith which the ancients were unacquainted. Dioscorides says that it\r\nwas found abundantly in Egypt; that it was of various kinds, but that\r\nthe slaty variety was the best. He mentions also many other localities.\r\nHe says that, for medical purposes, the most valued of all the\r\nvarieties of alumen were the _slaty_, the _round_, and the _liquid_.\r\nThe slaty alumen is very white, has an exceedingly astringent taste, a\r\nstrong smell, is free from stony concretions, and gradually cracks and\r\nemits long capillary crystals from these rifts; on which account it is\r\nsometimes called _trichites_. This description obviously applies to a\r\nkind of slate-clay, which probably contained pyrites mixed with it of\r\nthe decomposing kind. The capillary crystals were probably similar to\r\nthose crystals at present called _hair-salt_ by mineralogists, which\r\nexude pretty abundantly from the shale of the coal-beds, when it has\r\nbeen long exposed to the air. _Hair-salt_ differs very much in its\r\nnature. Klaproth ascertained by analysis, that the _hair-salt_ from the\r\nquicksilver-mines in Idria is sulphate of magnesia, mixed with a small\r\nquantity of sulphate of iron.[96] The _hair-salt_ from the abandoned\r\ncoal-pits in the neighbourhood of Glasgow is a double salt, composed of\r\nsulphate of alumina, and sulphate of iron, in definite proportions; the\r\ncomposition being\r\n\r\n[96] Beitrage, iii. 104.\r\n\r\n   1 atom protosulphate of iron,\r\n   1½ atom sulphate of alumina,\r\n  15 atoms water.\r\n\r\nI suspect strongly that the capillary crystals from the schistose\r\nalumen of Dioscorides were nearly of the same nature.\r\n\r\nFrom Pliny’s account of the uses to which alumen was applied, it is\r\nquite obvious that it must have varied very much in its nature. _Alumen\r\nnigrum_ was used to strike a black colour, and must therefore have\r\ncontained iron. It was doubtless an impure native sulphate of iron,\r\nsimilar to many native productions of the same nature still met with\r\nin various parts of the world, but not employed; their use having been\r\nsuperseded by various artificial salts, more definite in their nature,\r\nand consequently more certain in their application, and at the same\r\ntime cheaper and more abundant than the native.\r\n\r\nThe alumen employed as a mordant by the dyers, must have been a\r\nsulphate of alumina more or less pure; at least it must have been free\r\nfrom all sulphate of iron, which would have affected the colour of the\r\ncloth, and prevented the dyer from accomplishing his object.[97]\r\n\r\n[97] “Quoniam inficiendis claro colore lanis candidum liquidumque\r\nutilissimum est, contraque fuscis et obscuris nigrum.”--_Plinii_, xxxv.\r\n15.\r\n\r\nWhat the _alumen rotundum_ was, is not easily conjectured. Dioscorides\r\nsays, that it was sometimes made artificially; but that the artificial\r\nalumen rotundum was not much valued. The best, he says, was full of\r\nair-bubbles, nearly white, and of a very astringent taste. It had a\r\nslaty appearance, and was found in Egypt or the Island of Melos.\r\n\r\nThe _liquid alumen_ was limpid, milky, of an equal colour, free from\r\nhard concretions, and having a fiery shade of colour.[98] In its\r\nnature, it was similar to the alumen candidum; it must therefore have\r\nconsisted chiefly, at least, of sulphate of alumina.\r\n\r\n[98] See Dioscorides, lib. v. c. 123. Plinii Hist. Nat. xxxv. 18.\r\n\r\nBitumen and naphtha were known to the ancients, and used by them\r\nto give light instead of oil; they were employed also as external\r\napplications in cases of disease, and were considered as having\r\nthe same virtues as sulphur. It is said, that the word translated\r\n_salt_ in the New Testament--“Ye are the salt of the earth: but if\r\nthe salt have lost his savour, wherewith shall it be salted? It is\r\nhenceforth good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden\r\nunder foot of men”[99]--it is said, that the word salt in this passage\r\nrefers to asphalt, or bitumen, which was used by the Jews in their\r\nsacrifices, and called _salt_ by them. But I have not been able to find\r\nsatisfactory evidence of the truth of this opinion. It is obvious from\r\nthe context, that the word translated _salt_ could not have had that\r\nmeaning among the Jews; because salt never can be supposed to lose its\r\nsavour. Bitumen, while liquid, has a strong taste and smell, which it\r\nloses gradually by exposure to the air, as it approaches more and more\r\nto a solid form.\r\n\r\n[99] Matthew v. 13.--“Ὑμεις εστε το ἁλας της γης· εαν δε το ἁλας\r\nμωρανθη, εν τινι ἁλισθησεται· εις ουδεν ισχωει ετι ει μη βληθηναι εξω,\r\nκαι καταπατεισθαι ὑπο των ανθρωπων.”\r\n\r\nAsphalt was one of the great constituents of the Greek fire. A great\r\nbed of it still existing in Albania, supplied the Greeks with this\r\nsubstance. Concerning the nature of the Greek fire, it is clear that\r\nmany exaggerated and even fabulous statements have been published.\r\nThe obvious intention of the Greeks being, probably, to make their\r\ninvention as much dreaded as possible by their enemies. Nitre was\r\nundoubtedly one of the most important of its constituents; though\r\nno allusion whatever is ever made. We do not know when _nitrate of\r\npotash_, the nitre of the moderns, became known in Europe. It was\r\ndiscovered in the east; and was undoubtedly known in China and India\r\nbefore the commencement of the Christian era. The property of nitre,\r\nas a supporter of combustion, could not have remained long unknown\r\nafter the discovery of the salt. The first person who threw a piece of\r\nit upon a red-hot coal would observe it. Accordingly we find that its\r\nuse in fireworks was known very early in China and India; though its\r\nprodigious expansive power, by which it propels bullets with so great\r\nand destructive velocity, is a European invention, posterior to the\r\ntime of Roger Bacon.\r\n\r\nThe word _nitre_ (רתנ) had been applied by the ancients to _carbonate\r\nof soda_, a production of Egypt, where it is still formed from\r\nsea-water, by some unknown process of nature in the marshes near\r\nAlexandria. This is evident, not merely from the account given of it\r\nby Dioscorides and Pliny; for the following passage, from the Old\r\nTestament, shows that it had the same meaning among the Jews: “As he\r\nthat taketh away a garment in cold weather, is as vinegar upon nitre:\r\nso is he that singeth songs to a heavy heart.”[100] Vinegar poured upon\r\nsaltpetre produces no sensible effect whatever, but when poured upon\r\ncarbonate of soda, it occasions an _effervescence_. When saltpetre\r\ncame to be imported to Europe, it was natural to give it the same\r\nname as that applied to carbonate of soda, to which both in taste and\r\nappearance it bore some faint resemblance. Saltpetre possessing much\r\nmore striking properties than carbonate of soda much more attention\r\nwas drawn to it, and it gradually fixed upon itself the term _nitre_,\r\nat first applied to a different salt. When this change of nomenclature\r\ntook place does not appear; but it was completed before the time of\r\nRoger Bacon, who always applies the term _nitrum_ to our nitrate of\r\npotash and never to carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\n[100] Proverbs xxv. 20.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding history of the chemical facts known to the ancients,\r\nI have taken no notice of a well-known story related of Cleopatra.\r\nThis magnificent and profligate queen boasted to Antony that she would\r\nherself consume a million of sistertii at a supper. Antony smiled at\r\nthe proposal, and doubted the possibility of her performing it. Next\r\nevening a magnificent entertainment was provided, at which Antony, as\r\nusual, was present, and expressed his opinion that the cost of the\r\nfeast, magnificent as it was, fell far short of the sum specified by\r\nthe queen. She requested him to defer computing till the dessert\r\nwas finished. A vessel filled with vinegar was placed before her, in\r\nwhich she threw two pearls, the finest in the world, and which were\r\nvalued at ten millions of sistertii; these pearls were dissolved by\r\nthe vinegar,[101] and the liquid was immediately drunk by the queen.\r\nThus she made good her boast, and destroyed the two finest pearls in\r\nthe world.[102] This story, supposing it true, shows that Cleopatra\r\nwas aware that vinegar has the property of dissolving pearls. But not\r\nthat she knew the nature of these beautiful productions of nature. We\r\nnow know that pearls consist essentially of carbonate of lime, and that\r\nthe beauty is owing to the thin concentric laminæ, of which they are\r\ncomposed.\r\n\r\n[101] “Cujus asperitas visque in tabem margeritas resolvit.”\r\n\r\n[102] Plinii Hist. Nat. ix. 35.\r\n\r\nNor have I taken any notice of lime with which the ancients were well\r\nacquainted, and which they applied to most of the uses to which the\r\nmoderns put it. Thus it constituted the base of the Roman mortar, which\r\nis known to have been excellent. They employed it also as a manure\r\nfor the fields, as the moderns do. It was known to have a corrosive\r\nnature when taken internally; but was much employed by the ancients\r\nexternally, and in various ways as an application to ulcers. Whether\r\nthey knew its solubility in water does not appear; though, from the\r\ncircumstance of its being used for making mortar, this fact could\r\nhardly escape them. These facts, though of great importance, could\r\nscarcely be applied to the rearing of a chemical structure, as the\r\nancients could have no notion of the action of acids upon lime, or of\r\nthe numerous salts which it is capable of forming. Phenomena which\r\nmust have remained unknown till the discovery of the acids enabled\r\nexperimenters to try their effects upon limestone and quicklime. Not\r\neven a conjecture appears in any ancient writer that I have looked\r\ninto, about the difference between quicklime and limestone. This\r\ndifference is so great that it must have been remarked by them, yet\r\nnobody seems ever to have thought of attempting to account for it. Even\r\nthe method of burning or calcining lime is not described by Pliny;\r\nthough there can be no doubt that the ancients were acquainted with it.\r\n\r\nNor have I taken any notice of leather or the method of tanning it.\r\nThere are so many allusions to leather and its uses by the ancient\r\npoets and historians, that the acquaintance of the ancients with it is\r\nput out of doubt. But so far as I know, there is no description of the\r\nprocess of tanning in any ancient author whatever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY OF THE ARABIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto I have spoken of Alchymy, or of the chemical manufactures\r\nof the ancients. The people to whom scientific chemistry owes its\r\norigin are the Arabians. Not that they prosecuted scientific chemistry\r\nthemselves; but they were the first persons who attempted to form\r\nchemical medicines. This they did by mixing various bodies with each\r\nother, and applying heat to the mixture in various ways. This led to\r\nthe discovery of some of the mineral acids. These they applied to\r\nthe metals, &c., and ascertained the effects produced upon that most\r\nimportant class of bodies. Thus the Arabians began those researches\r\nwhich led gradually to the formation of scientific chemistry. We must\r\ntherefore endeavour to ascertain the chemical facts for which we are\r\nindebted to the Arabians.\r\n\r\nWhen Mahomet first delivered his dogmas to his countrymen they were not\r\naltogether barbarous. Possessed of a copious and expressive language,\r\nand inhabiting a burning climate, their imaginations were lively and\r\ntheir passions violent. Poetry and fiction were cultivated by them\r\nwith ardour, and with considerable success. But science and inductive\r\nphilosophy, had made little or no progress among them. The fatalism\r\nintroduced by Mahomet, and the blind enthusiasm which he inculcated,\r\nrendered them furious bigots and determined enemies to every kind of\r\nintellectual improvement. The rapidity with which they overran Asia,\r\nAfrica, and even a portion of Europe, is universally known. At that\r\nperiod the western world, was sunk into extreme barbarism, and the\r\nGreeks, with whom the remains of civilization still lingered, were\r\nsadly degenerated from those sages who graced the classic ages. Bent\r\nto the earth under the most grinding but turbulent despotism that\r\never disgraced mankind, and having their understandings sealed up by\r\nthe most subtle and absurd, and uncompromising superstition, all the\r\nenergy of mind, all the powers of invention, all the industry and\r\ntalent, which distinguished their ancestors, had completely forsaken\r\nthem. Their writers aimed at nothing new or great, and were satisfied\r\nwith repeating the scientific facts determined by their ancestors. The\r\nlamp of science fluttered in its socket, and was on the eve of being\r\nextinguished.\r\n\r\nNothing good or great could be expected from such a state of society.\r\nIt was, therefore, wisely determined by Providence that the Mussulman\r\nconquerors, should overrun the earth, sweep out those miserable\r\ngovernors, and free the wretched inhabitants from the trammels of\r\ndespotism and superstition. As a despotism not less severe, and a\r\nsuperstition still more gloomy and uncompromising, was substituted in\r\ntheir place, it may seem at first sight, that the conquests of the\r\nMahometans brought things into a worse state than they found them. But\r\nthe listless inactivity, the almost deathlike torpor which had frozen\r\nthe minds of mankind, were effectually roused. The Mussulmans displayed\r\na degree of energy and activity which have few parallels in the history\r\nof the world: and after the conquests of the Mahometans were completed,\r\nand the Califs quietly seated upon the greatest and most powerful\r\nthrone that the world had ever seen; after Almanzor, about the middle\r\nof the eighth century, had founded the city of Bagdad, and settled a\r\npermanent and flourishing peace, the arts and sciences, which usually\r\naccompany such a state of society, began to make their appearance.\r\n\r\nThat calif founded an academy at Bagdad, which acquired much celebrity,\r\nand gradually raised itself above all the other academies in his\r\ndominions. A medical college was established there with powers to\r\nexamine all those persons who intended to devote themselves to the\r\nmedical profession. So many professors and pupils flocked to this\r\ncelebrated college, from all parts of the world, that at one time their\r\nnumber amounted to no fewer than six thousand. Public hospitals and\r\nlaboratories were established to facilitate a knowledge of diseases,\r\nand to make the students acquainted with the method of preparing\r\nmedicines. It was this last establishment which originated with the\r\ncalifs that gave a first beginning to the science of chemistry.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century the calif Mostanser re-established the\r\nacademy and the medical college at Bagdad: for both had fallen\r\ninto decay, and had been replaced by an infinite number of Jewish\r\nseminaries. Mostanser gave large salaries to the professors, collected\r\na magnificent library, and established a new school of pharmacy. He was\r\nhimself often present at the public lectures.\r\n\r\nThe successor of Mostanser was the calif Haroun-Al-Raschid, the\r\nperpetual hero of the Arabian tales. He not only carried his love for\r\nthe sciences further than his predecessors, but displayed a liberality\r\nand a tolerance for religious opinions, which was not quite consistent\r\nwith Mahometan bigotry and superstition. He drew round him the\r\nSyrian Christians, who translated the Greek classics, rewarded them\r\nliberally, and appointed them instructors of his Mahometan subjects,\r\nespecially in medicine and pharmacy. He protected the Christian school\r\nof Dschondisabour, founded by the Nestorian Christians, before the\r\ntime of Mahomet, and still continuing in a flourishing state: always\r\nsurrounded by literary men, he frequently condescended to take a part\r\nin their discussions, and not unfrequently, as might have been expected\r\nfrom his rank, came off victorious.\r\n\r\nThe most enlightened of all the califs was Almamon, who has rendered\r\nhis name immortal by his exertions in favour of the sciences. It\r\nwas during his reign that the Arabian schools came to be thoroughly\r\nacquainted with Greek science; he procured the translation of a great\r\nnumber of important works. This conduct inflamed the religious zeal\r\nof the faithful, who devoted him to destruction, and to the divine\r\nwrath, for favouring philosophy, and in that way diminishing the\r\nauthority of the Koran. Almamon purchased the ancient classics, from\r\nall quarters, and recommended the care of doing so in a particular\r\nmanner to his ambassadors at the court of the Greek emperors. To Leo,\r\nthe philosopher, he made the most advantageous offers, to induce\r\nhim to come to Bagdad; but that philosopher would not listen to his\r\ninvitation. It was under the auspices of this enlightened prince, that\r\nthe celebrated attempt was made to determine the size of the earth by\r\nmeasuring a degree of the meridian. The result of this attempt it does\r\nnot belong to this work to relate.\r\n\r\nAlmotassem and Motawakkel, who succeeded Almamon, followed his example,\r\nfavoured the sciences, and extended their protection to men of science\r\nwho were Christians. Motawakkel re-established the celebrated academy\r\nand library of Alexandria. But he acted with more severity than his\r\npredecessors with regard to the Christians, who may perhaps have abused\r\nthe tolerance which they enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThe other vicars of the prophet, in the different Mahometan states,\r\nfollowed the fine example set them by Almamon. Already in the eighth\r\ncentury the sovereigns of Mogreb and the western provinces of\r\nAfrica showed themselves the zealous friends of the sciences. One of\r\nthem called Abdallah-Ebn-Ibadschab rendered commerce and industry\r\nflourishing at Tunis. He himself cultivated poetry and drew numerous\r\nartists and men of science into his state. At Fez and in Morocco the\r\nsciences flourished, especially during the reign of the Edrisites,\r\nthe last of whom, Jahiah, a prince possessed of genius, sweetness,\r\nand goodness, changed his court into an academy, and paid attention\r\nto those only who had distinguished themselves by their scientific\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nBut Spain was the most fortunate of all the Mahometan states, and had\r\narrived at such a degree of prosperity both in commerce, manufactures,\r\npopulation, and wealth, as is hardly to be credited. The three\r\nAbdalrahmans and Alhakem carried, from the eighth to the tenth century,\r\nthe country subject to the Calif of Cordova to the highest degree of\r\nsplendour. They protected the sciences, and governed with so much\r\nmildness, that Spain was probably never so happy under the dominion\r\nof any Christian prince. Alhakem established at Cordova an academy,\r\nwhich for several ages was the most celebrated in the whole world. All\r\nthe Christians of Western Europe repaired to this academy in search of\r\ninformation. It contained, in the tenth century, a library of 280,000\r\nvolumes. The catalogue of this library filled no less than forty-four\r\nvolumes. Seville, Toledo, and Murcia, had likewise their schools of\r\nscience and their libraries, which retained their celebrity as long as\r\nthe dominion of the Moors lasted. In the twelfth century there were\r\nseventy public libraries in that part of Spain which belonged to the\r\nMahometans. Cordova had produced one hundred and fifty authors, Almeria\r\nfifty-two, and Murcia sixty-two.\r\n\r\nThe Mahometan states of the east continued also to favour the sciences.\r\nAn emir of Irak, Adad-El-Daula by name, distinguished himself towards\r\nthe end of the tenth century by the protection which he afforded\r\nto men of science. To him almost all the philosophers of the age\r\ndedicated their works. Another emir of Irak, Saif-Ed-Daula, established\r\nschools at Kufa and at Bussora, which soon acquired great celebrity.\r\nAbou-Mansor-Baharam, established a public library at Firuzabad in\r\nCurdistan, which at its very commencement contained 7000 volumes. In\r\nthe thirteenth century there existed a celebrated school of medicine in\r\nDamascus. The calif Malek-Adel endowed it richly, and was often present\r\nat the lectures with a book under his arm.\r\n\r\nHad the progress of the sciences among the Arabians been proportional\r\nto the number of those who cultivated them, we might hail the Saracens\r\nas the saviours of literature during the dark and benighted ages of\r\nChristianity; but we must acknowledge with regret, that notwithstanding\r\nthe enlightened views of the califs, notwithstanding the multiplicity\r\nof academies and libraries, and the prodigious number of writers, the\r\nsciences received but little improvement from the Arabians. There are\r\nvery few Arabian writers in whose works we find either philosophical\r\nideas, successful researches, new facts, or great and new and important\r\ntruths. How, indeed, could such things be expected from a people\r\nnaturally hostile to mental exertion; professing a religion which\r\nstigmatizes all exercise of the judgment as a crime, and weighed down\r\nby the heavy yoke of despotism? It was the religion of the Arabians,\r\nand the despotism of their princes, that opposed the greatest obstacles\r\nto the progress of the sciences, even during the most flourishing\r\nperiod of their civilization.[103] Fortunately chemistry was the\r\nbranch of science least obnoxious to the religious prejudices of the\r\nMahometans. It was in it, therefore, that the greatest improvements\r\nwere made: of these improvements it will be requisite now to endeavour\r\nto give the reader some idea. Astrology and alchymy, they both derived\r\nfrom the Greeks: neither of them were inconsistent with the taste of\r\nthe nation--neither of them were anathematized by the Mahometan creed,\r\nthough Islamism prohibited magic and all the arts of divination.\r\nAlchymy may have suggested the chemical processes--but the Arabians\r\napplied them to the preparation of medicines, and thus opened a new and\r\nmost copious source of investigation.\r\n\r\n[103] For a fuller account of the progress of science among the\r\nArabians than would be consistent with this work, the reader is\r\nreferred to Mortucla’s Hist. des Mathématiques, i. 351; Sprengel’s\r\nHist. de la Médecine, ii. 246.\r\n\r\nThe chemical writings of the Arabians which I have had an opportunity\r\nof seeing and perusing in a Latin dress, being ignorant of the original\r\nlanguage in which they were written, are those of Geber and Avicenna.\r\n\r\nGeber, whose real name was Abou-Moussah-Dschafar-Al-Soli, was a Sabean\r\nof Harran, in Mesopotamia, and lived during the eighth century. Very\r\nlittle is known respecting the history of this writer, who must be\r\nconsidered as the patriarch of chemistry. Golius, professor of the\r\noriental languages in the University of Leyden, made a present of\r\nGeber’s work in manuscript to the public library. He translated\r\nit into Latin, and published it in the same city in folio, and\r\nafterwards in quarto, under the title of “Lapis Philosophorum.”[104]\r\nIt was translated into English by Richard Russel in 1678, under the\r\ntitle of, “The Works of Geber, the most famous Arabian Prince and\r\nPhilosopher.”[105] The works of Geber, so far as they appeared in\r\nLatin or English, consist of four tracts. The first is entitled, “Of\r\nthe Investigation or Search of Perfection.” The second is entitled, “Of\r\nthe Sum of Perfection, or of the perfect Magistery.” The third, “Of the\r\nInvention of Verity or Perfection.” And the last, “Of Furnaces, &c.;\r\nwith a Recapitulation of the Author’s Experiments.”\r\n\r\n[104] Boerhaave’s Chemistry (Shaw’s translation), i. 26. _Note._\r\n\r\n[105] Golius was not, however, the first translator of Geber. A\r\ntranslation of the longest and most important of his tracts into Latin\r\nappeared in Strasburg, in 1529. There was another translation published\r\nin Italy, from a manuscript in the Vatican. There probably might be\r\nother translations. I have compared four different copies of Geber’s\r\nworks, and found some differences, though not very material. I have\r\nfollowed Russel’s English translation most commonly, as upon the whole\r\nthe most accurate that I have seen.\r\n\r\nThe object of Geber’s work is to teach the method of making the\r\nphilosopher’s stone, which he distinguishes usually by the name of\r\n_medicine of the third class_. The whole is in general written with so\r\nmuch plainness, that we can understand the nature of the substances\r\nwhich he employed, the processes which he followed, and the greater\r\nnumber of the products which he obtained. It is, therefore, a book\r\nof some importance, because it is the oldest chemical treatise in\r\nexistence,[106] and because it makes us acquainted with the processes\r\nfollowed by the Arabians, and the progress which they had made in\r\nchemical investigations. I shall therefore lay before the reader the\r\nmost important facts contained in Geber’s work.\r\n\r\n[106] Of course I exclude the writings of the Greek ecclesiastics\r\nmentioned in a previous part of this work, which still continue in\r\nmanuscript; because, I am ignorant of what they contain.\r\n\r\n1. He considered all the metals as compounds of mercury and sulphur:\r\nthis opinion did not originate with him. It is evident from what he\r\nsays, that the same notion had been adopted by his predecessors--men\r\nwhom he speaks of under the title of the _ancients_.\r\n\r\n2. The metals with which he was acquainted were _gold_, _silver_,\r\n_copper_, _iron_, _tin_, and _lead_. These are usually distinguished\r\nby him under the names of _Sol_, _Luna_, _Venus_, _Mars_, _Jupiter_,\r\nand _Saturn_. Whether these names of the planets were applied to the\r\nmetals by Geber, or only by his translators, I cannot say; but they\r\nwere always employed by the alchymists, who never designated the metals\r\nby any other appellations.\r\n\r\n3. Gold and silver he considered as perfect metals; but the other four\r\nwere imperfect metals. The difference between them depends, in his\r\nopinion, partly upon the proportions of mercury and sulphur in each,\r\nand partly upon the purity or impurity of the mercury and sulphur which\r\nenters into the composition of each.\r\n\r\nGold, according to him, is created of the most subtile substance of\r\nmercury and of most clear fixture, and of a small substance of sulphur,\r\nclean and of pure redness, fixed, clear, and changed from its own\r\nnature, tinging that; and because there happens a diversity in the\r\ncolours of that sulphur, the yellowness of gold must needs have a like\r\ndiversity.[107] His evidence that gold consisted chiefly of mercury, is\r\nthe great ease with which mercury dissolves gold. For mercury, in his\r\nopinion, dissolves nothing that is not of its own nature. The lustre\r\nand splendour of gold is another proof of the great proportion of\r\nmercury which it contains. That it is a fixed substance, void of all\r\nburning sulphur, he thinks evident by every operation in the fire, for\r\nit is neither diminished nor inflamed. His other reasons are not so\r\nintelligible.[108]\r\n\r\n[107] Sum of Perfection, book ii. part i. chap. 5.\r\n\r\n[108] Ibid.\r\n\r\nSilver, like gold, is composed of much mercury and a little sulphur;\r\nbut in the gold the sulphur is red; whereas the sulphur that goes to\r\nthe formation of silver is white. The sulphur in silver is also clean,\r\nfixed, and clear. Silver has a purity short of that of gold, and a\r\nmore gross inspissation. The proof of this is, that its parts are not\r\nso condensed, nor is it so fixed as gold; for it may be diminished by\r\nfire, which is not the case with gold.[109]\r\n\r\n[109] Ibid., chap. 6.\r\n\r\nIron is composed of earthy mercury and earthy sulphur, highly fixed,\r\nthe latter in by far the greatest quantity. Sulphur, by the work of\r\nfixation, more easily destroys the easiness of liquefaction than\r\nmercury. Hence the reason why iron is not fusible, as is the case with\r\nthe other metals.[110]\r\n\r\n[110] Sum of Perfection, book ii. part i. chap. 7.\r\n\r\nSulphur not fixed melts sooner than mercury; but fixed sulphur opposes\r\nfusion. What contains more fixed sulphur, more slowly admits of fusion\r\nthan what partakes of burning sulphur, which more easily and sooner\r\nflows.[111]\r\n\r\n[111] Ibid.\r\n\r\nCopper is composed of sulphur unclean, gross and fixed as to its\r\ngreater part; but as to its lesser part not fixed, red, and livid,\r\nin relation to the whole not overcoming nor overcome and of gross\r\nmercury.[112]\r\n\r\n[112] Ibid., chap. 8.\r\n\r\nWhen copper is exposed to ignition, you may discern a sulphureous flame\r\nto arise from it, which is a sign of sulphur not fixed; and the loss\r\nof the quantity of it by exhalation through the frequent combustion\r\nof it, shows that it has fixed sulphur. This last being in abundance,\r\noccasions the slowness of its fusion and the hardness of its substance.\r\nThat copper contains red and unclean sulphur, united to unclean\r\nmercury, is, he thinks, evident, from its sensible qualities.[113]\r\n\r\n[113] Ibid.\r\n\r\nTin consists of sulphur of small fixation, white with a whiteness not\r\npure, not overcoming but overcome, mixed with mercury partly fixed and\r\npartly not fixed, white and impure.[114] That this is the constitution\r\nof tin he thinks evident; for when calcined, it emits a sulphureous\r\nstench, which is a sign of sulphur not fixed: it yields no flame, not\r\nbecause the sulphur is fixed, but because it contains a great portion\r\nof mercury. In tin there is a twofold sulphur and also a twofold\r\nmercury. One sulphur is less fixed, because in calcining it gives out\r\na stench as sulphur. The fixed sulphur continues in the tin after it\r\nis calcined. He thinks that the twofold mercury in tin is evident, from\r\nthis, that before calcination it makes a crashing noise when bent, but\r\nafter it has been thrice calcined, that crashing noise can no longer\r\nbe perceived.[115] Geber says, that if lead be washed with mercury,\r\nand after its washing melted in a fire not exceeding the fire of its\r\nfusion, a portion of the mercury will remain combined with the lead,\r\nand will give it the crashing noise and all the qualities of tin. On\r\nthe other hand, you may convert tin into lead. By manifold repetition\r\nof its calcination, and the administration of fire convenient for its\r\nreduction, it is turned into lead.[116]\r\n\r\n[114] Ibid., chap. 9.\r\n\r\n[115] Sum of Perfection, book ii. part i. chap. 9.\r\n\r\n[116] Ibid.\r\n\r\nLead, in Geber’s opinion, differs from tin only in having a more\r\nunclean substance commixed of the two more gross substances, sulphur\r\nand mercury. The sulphur in it is burning and more adhesive to the\r\nsubstance of its own mercury, and it has more of the substance of fixed\r\nsulphur in its composition than tin has.[117]\r\n\r\n[117] Ibid., chap. 10.\r\n\r\nSuch are the opinions which Geber entertained respecting the\r\ncomposition of the metals. I have been induced to state them as nearly\r\nin his own words as possible, and to give the reasons which he has\r\nassigned for them, even when his facts were not quite correct, because\r\nI thought that this was the most likely way of conveying to the reader\r\nan accurate notion of the sentiments of this father of the alchymists,\r\nupon the very foundation of the whole doctrine of the transmutation\r\nof metals. He was of opinion that all the imperfect metals might be\r\ntransformed into gold and silver, by altering the proportions of the\r\nmercury and sulphur of which they are composed, and by changing the\r\nnature of the mercury and sulphur so as to make them the same with the\r\nmercury and sulphur which constitute gold and silver. The substance\r\ncapable of producing these important changes he calls sometimes the\r\n_philosopher’s stone_, but generally the _medicine_. He gives the\r\nmethod of preparing this important _magistery_, as he calls it. But it\r\nis not worth while to state his process, because he leaves out several\r\nparticulars, in order to prevent the foolish from reaping any benefit\r\nfrom his writings, while at the same time those readers who possess the\r\nproper degree of sagacity will be able, by studying the different parts\r\nof his writings, to divine the nature of the steps which he omits, and\r\nthus profit by his researches and explanations. But it will be worth\r\nwhile to notice the most important of his processes, because this will\r\nenable us to judge of the state of chemistry in his time.\r\n\r\n4. In his book on furnaces, he gives a description of a furnace proper\r\nfor calcining metals, and from the fourteenth chapter of the fourth\r\npart of the first book of his Sum of Perfection, it is obvious that the\r\nmethod of calcining or oxidizing iron, copper, tin, and lead, and also\r\nmercury and arsenic were familiarly known to him.\r\n\r\nHe gives a description of a furnace for distilling, and a pretty minute\r\naccount of the glass or stoneware, or metallic aludel and alembic,\r\nby means of which the process was conducted. He was in the habit of\r\ndistilling by surrounding his aludel with hot ashes, to prevent it\r\nfrom being broken. He was acquainted also with the water-bath. These\r\nprocesses were familiar to him. The description of the distillation of\r\nmany bodies occurs in his work; but there is not the least evidence\r\nthat he was acquainted with ardent spirits. The term _spirit_ occurs\r\nfrequently in his writings, but it was applied to volatile bodies in\r\ngeneral, and in particular to sulphur and white arsenic, which he\r\nconsidered as substances very similar in their properties. Mercury also\r\nhe considered as a spirit.\r\n\r\nThe method of distilling _per descensum_, as is practised in the\r\nsmelting of zinc, was also known to him. He describes an apparatus for\r\nthe purpose, and gives several examples of such distillations in his\r\nwritings.\r\n\r\nHe gives also a description of a furnace for melting metals, and\r\nmentions the vessels in which such processes were conducted. He was\r\nacquainted with crucibles; and even describes the mode of making\r\ncupels, nearly similar to those used at present. The process of\r\ncupellating gold and silver, and purifying them by means of lead, is\r\ngiven by him pretty minutely and accurately: he calls it _cineritium_,\r\nor at least that is the term used by his Latin translator.\r\n\r\nHe was in the habit of dissolving salts in water and acetic acid, and\r\neven the metals in different menstrua. Of these menstrua he nowhere\r\ngives any account; but from our knowledge of the properties of the\r\ndifferent metals, and from some processes which he notices, it is easy\r\nto perceive what his solvents must have been; namely, the mineral acids\r\nwhich were known to him, and to which there is no allusion whatever\r\nin any preceding writer that I have had an opportunity of consulting.\r\nWhether Geber was the discoverer of these acids cannot be known, as\r\nhe nowhere claims the discovery: indeed his object was to slur over\r\nthese acids, as much as possible, that their existence, or at least\r\ntheir remarkable properties, might not be suspected by the uninitiated.\r\nIt was this affectation of secrecy and mystery that has deprived the\r\nearliest chemists of that credit and reputation to which they would\r\nhave been justly entitled, had their discoveries been made known to the\r\npublic in a plain and intelligible manner.\r\n\r\nThe mode of purifying liquids by filtration, and of separating\r\nprecipitates from liquids by the same means, was known to Geber. He\r\ncalled the process _distillation through a filter_.\r\n\r\nThus the greater number of chemical processes, such as they were\r\npractised almost to the end of the eighteenth century, were known to\r\nGeber. If we compare his works with those of Dioscorides and Pliny, we\r\nshall perceive the great progress which chemistry or rather pharmacy\r\nhad made. It is more than probable that these improvements were made\r\nby the Arabian physicians, or at least by the physicians who filled\r\nthe chairs in the medical schools, which were under the protection of\r\nthe califs: for as no notice is taken of these processes by any of the\r\nGreek or Roman writers that have come down to us, and as we find them\r\nminutely described by the earliest chemical writers among the Arabians,\r\nwe have no other alternative than to admit that they originated in the\r\neast.\r\n\r\nI shall now state the different chemical substances or preparations\r\nwhich were known to Geber, or which he describes the method of\r\npreparing in his works.\r\n\r\n1. Common salt. This substance occurring in such abundance in the\r\nearth, and being indispensable as a seasoner of food, was known from\r\nthe earliest ages. But Geber describes the method which he adopted to\r\nfree it from impurities. It was exposed to a red heat, then dissolved\r\nin water, filtered, crystallized by evaporation, and the crystals being\r\nexposed to a red heat, were put into a close vessel, and kept for\r\nuse.[118] Whether the identity of sal-gem (_native salt_) and common\r\nsalt was known to Geber is nowhere said. Probably not, as he gives\r\nseparate directions for purifying each.\r\n\r\n[118] Investigation and Search of Perfection, chap. 3.\r\n\r\n2. Geber gives an account of the two fixed alkalies, _potash_ and\r\n_soda_, and gives processes for obtaining them. Potash was obtained by\r\nburning cream of tartar in a crucible, dissolving the residue in water,\r\nfiltering the solution, and evaporating to dryness.[119] This would\r\nyield a pure carbonate of potash.\r\n\r\n[119] Invention of Verity, chap. 4.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of soda he calls _sagimen vitri_, and salt of soda. He\r\nmentions plants which yield it when burnt, points out the method of\r\npurifying it, and even describes the method of rendering it caustic by\r\nmeans of quicklime.[120]\r\n\r\n[120] Search of Perfection, chap. 3.\r\n\r\n3. Saltpetre, or nitrate of potash, was known to him; and Geber is the\r\nfirst writer in whom we find an account of this salt. Nothing is said\r\nrespecting its origin; but there can be little doubt that it came from\r\nIndia, where it was collected, and known long before Europeans were\r\nacquainted with it. The knowledge of this salt was probably one great\r\ncause of the superiority of the Arabians over Europeans in chemical\r\nknowledge; for it enabled them to procure _nitric acid_, by means of\r\nwhich they dissolved all the metals known in their time, and thus\r\nacquired a knowledge of various important saline compounds, which were\r\nof considerable importance.\r\n\r\nThere is a process for preparing saltpetre artificially, in several of\r\nthe Latin copies of Geber, though it does not appear in our English\r\ntranslation. The method was to dissolve sagimen vitri, or carbonate of\r\nsoda, in aqua fortis, to filter and crystallize by evaporation.[121]\r\nIf this process be genuine, it is obvious that Geber must have been\r\nacquainted with nitrate of soda; but I have some doubts about the\r\ngenuineness of the passage, because the term _aqua fortis_ occurs in\r\nit. Now this term occurs nowhere else in Geber’s work: even when he\r\ngives the process for procuring nitric acid, he calls it simply water;\r\nbut observes, that it is a water possessed of much virtue, and that it\r\nconstitutes a precious instrument in the hands of the man who possesses\r\nsagacity to use it aright.\r\n\r\n[121] De Investigatione Perfect. chap. 4.\r\n\r\n4. Sal ammoniac was known to Geber, and seems to have been quite common\r\nin his time. There is no evidence that it was known to the Greeks or\r\nRomans, as neither Dioscorides nor Pliny make any allusion to it.\r\nThe word in old books is sometimes _sal armoniac_, sometimes _sal\r\nammoniac_. It is supposed to have been brought originally from the\r\nneighbourhood of the temple of Jupiter Ammon: but had this been the\r\ncase, and had it occurred native, it could scarcely have been unknown\r\nto the Romans, under whose dominions that part of Africa fell. In\r\nthe writings of the alchymists, sal ammoniac is mentioned under the\r\nfollowing whimsical names:\r\n\r\n    Anima sensibilis,\r\n    Aqua duorum fratrum ex sorore,\r\n    Aquila,\r\n    Lapis aquilinis,\r\n    Cancer,\r\n    Lapis angeli conjungentis,\r\n    Sal lapidum,\r\n    Sal alocoph.\r\n\r\nGeber not only knew sal ammoniac, but he was aware of its volatility;\r\nand gives various processes for subliming it, and uses it frequently\r\nto promote the sublimation of other bodies, as of oxides of iron\r\nand copper. He gives also a method of procuring it from urine, a\r\nliquid which, when allowed to run into putrefaction, is known to\r\nyield it in abundance. Sal ammoniac was much used by Geber, in his\r\nvarious processes to bring the inferior metals to a state of greater\r\nperfection. By adding it or common salt to aqua fortis, he was enabled\r\nto dissolve gold, which certainly could not be accomplished in the\r\ntime of Dioscorides or Pliny. The description, indeed, of Geber’s\r\nprocess for dissolving gold is left on purpose in a defective state;\r\nbut an attentive reader will find no great difficulty in supplying the\r\ndefects, and thus understanding the whole of the process.\r\n\r\n5. Alum, precisely the same as the alum of the moderns, was familiarly\r\nknown to Geber, and employed by him in his processes. The manufacture\r\nof this salt, therefore, had been discovered between the time when\r\nPliny composed his Natural History and the eighth century, when Geber\r\nwrote; unless we admit that the mode of making it had been known to\r\nthe Tyrian dyers, but that they had kept the secret so well, that no\r\nsuspicion of its existence was entertained by the Greeks and Romans.\r\nThat they employed _alumina_ as a mordant in some of their dyes, is\r\nevident; but there is no proof whatever that _alum_, in the modern\r\nsense of the word, was known to them.\r\n\r\nGeber mentions three alums which he was in the habit of using; namely,\r\nicy alum, or Rocca alum; Jamenous alum, or alum of Jameni, and feather\r\nalum. _Rocca_, or _Edessa_, in Syria, is admitted to have been the\r\nplace where the first manufactory of alum was established; but at what\r\ntime, or by whom, is quite unknown: we know only that it must have\r\nbeen posterior to the commencement of the Christian era, and prior to\r\nthe eighth century, when Geber wrote. Jameni must have been another\r\nlocality where, at the time of Geber, a manufactory of alum existed.\r\n_Feather alum_ was undoubtedly one of the native impure varieties of\r\n_alum_, known to the Greeks and Romans. Geber was in the habit of\r\ndistilling alum by a strong heat, and of preserving the water which\r\ncame over as a valuable menstruum. If alum be exposed to a red heat\r\nin glass vessels, it will give out a portion of sulphuric acid: hence\r\nwater distilled from alum by Geber was probably a weak solution of\r\nsulphuric acid, which would undoubtedly act powerfully as a solvent of\r\niron, and of the alkaline carbonates. It was probably in this way that\r\nhe used it.\r\n\r\n6. Sulphate of iron or copperas, as it is called (_cuperosa_), in the\r\nstate of a crystalline salt, was well known to Geber, and appears in\r\nhis time to have been manufactured.\r\n\r\n7. Baurach, or borax, is mentioned by him, but without any description\r\nby which we can know whether or not it was our borax: the probability\r\nis that it was. Both glass and borax were used by him when the oxides\r\nof metals were reduced by him to the metallic state.\r\n\r\n8. Vinegar was purified by him by distilling it over, and it was used\r\nas a solvent in many of his processes.\r\n\r\n9. Nitric acid was known to him by the name of _dissolving water_. He\r\nprepared it by putting into an alembic one pound of sulphate of iron of\r\nCyprus, half a pound of saltpetre, and a quarter of a pound of alum of\r\nJameni: this mixture was distilled till every thing liquid was driven\r\nover. He mentions the red fumes which make their appearance in the\r\nalembic during the process.[122] This process, though not an economical\r\none, would certainly yield nitric acid; and it is remarkable, because\r\nit is here that we find the first hint of the knowledge of chemists of\r\nthis most important acid, without which many chemical processes of the\r\nutmost importance could not be performed at all.\r\n\r\n[122] Invention of Verity, chap. 23.\r\n\r\n10. This acid, thus prepared, he made use of to dissolve silver: the\r\nsolution was concentrated till the nitrate of silver was obtained by\r\nhim in a crystallized state. This process is thus described by him:\r\n“Dissolve silver calcined in solutive water (_nitric acid_), as before;\r\nwhich being done, coct it in a phial with a long neck, the orifice of\r\nwhich must be left unstopped, for one day only, until a third part of\r\nthe water be consumed. This being effected, set it with its vessel in\r\na cold place, and then it is converted into small fusible stones, like\r\ncrystal.”[123]\r\n\r\n[123] Ibid., chap. 21.\r\n\r\n11. He was in the habit also of dissolving sal ammoniac in this nitric\r\nacid, and employing the solution, which was the aqua regia of the old\r\nchemists, to dissolve gold.[124] He assures us that this aqua regia\r\nwould dissolve likewise sulphur and silver. The latter assertion is\r\nerroneous. But sulphur is easily converted into sulphuric acid by the\r\naction of aqua regia, and of course it disappears or dissolves.\r\n\r\n[124] Ibid., chap. 23.\r\n\r\n12. Corrosive sublimate is likewise described by Geber in a very\r\nintelligible manner. His method of preparing it was as follows: “Take\r\nof mercury one pound, of dried sulphate of iron two pounds, of alum\r\ncalcined one pound, of common salt half a pound, and of saltpetre a\r\nquarter of a pound: incorporate altogether by trituration and sublime;\r\ngather the white, dense, and ponderous portions which shall be found\r\nabout the sides of the vessel. If in the first sublimation you find it\r\nturbid or unclean (which may happen by reason of your own negligence),\r\nsublime a second time with the same fuses.”[125] Still more minute\r\ndirections are given in other parts of the work: we have even some\r\nimperfect account of the properties of corrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\n[125] Invention of Verity, chap. 8.\r\n\r\n13. Corrosive sublimate is not the only preparation of mercury\r\nmentioned by Geber. He informs us that when mercury is combined\r\nwith sulphur it assumes a red colour, and becomes cinnabar.[126] He\r\ndescribes the affinities of mercury for the different metals. It\r\nadheres easily to three metals; namely, lead, tin, and gold; to silver\r\nwith more difficulty. To copper with still more difficulty than to\r\nsilver; but to iron it unites in nowise unless by artifice.[127] This\r\nis a tolerably accurate account of the matter. He says, that mercury is\r\nthe heaviest body in nature except gold, which is the only metal that\r\nwill sink in it.[128] Now this was true, applied to all the substances\r\nknown when Geber lived.\r\n\r\n[126] Sum of Perfection, book i. part iii. chap. 4.\r\n\r\n[127] Ibid., chap. 6.\r\n\r\n[128] Ibid.\r\n\r\nHe gives an account of the method of forming the peroxide of mercury\r\nby heat; that variety of it formerly distinguished by the name of _red\r\nprecipitati per se_. “Mercury,” he says, “is also coagulated by long\r\nand constant retention in fire, in a glass vessel with a very long\r\nneck and round belly; the orifice of the neck being kept open, that\r\nthe humidity may vanish thereby.”[129] He gives another process for\r\npreparing this oxide, possible, perhaps, though certainly requiring\r\nvery cautious regulation of the fire. “Take,” says he, “of mercury\r\none pound, of vitriol (sulphate of iron) rubified two pounds, and of\r\nsaltpetre one pound. Mortify the mercury with these, and then sublime\r\nit from rock alum and saltpetre in equal weights.”[130]\r\n\r\n[129] Sum of Perfection, book i. part iv. chap. 16.\r\n\r\n[130] Invention of Verity, chap. 10.\r\n\r\n14. Geber was acquainted with several of the compounds of metals with\r\nsulphur. He remarks that sulphur when fused with metals increases their\r\nweight.[131] Copper combined with sulphur becomes yellow, and mercury\r\nred.[132] He knew the method of dissolving sulphur in caustic potash,\r\nand again precipitating it by the addition of an acid. His process is\r\nas follows: “Grind clear and gummose sulphur to a most subtile powder,\r\nwhich boil in a lixivium made of ashes of _heartsease_ and quicklime,\r\ngathering from off the surface its oleaginous combustibility, until it\r\nbe discerned to be clear. This being done, stir the whole with a stick,\r\nand then warily take off that which passeth out with the lixivium,\r\nleaving the more gross parts in the bottom. Permit that extract to\r\ncool a little, and upon it pour a fourth part of its own quantity of\r\ndistilled vinegar, and then will the whole suddenly be congealed as\r\nmilk. Remove as much of the clear lixivium as you can; but dry the\r\nresidue with a gentle fire and keep it.”[133]\r\n\r\n[131] Sum of Perfection, book i. part iii. chap. 4.\r\n\r\n[132] Ibid.\r\n\r\n[133] Invention of Verity, chap. 6.\r\n\r\n15. It would appear from various passages in Geber’s works that he was\r\nacquainted with arsenic in the metallic state. He frequently mentions\r\nits combustibility, and considers it as the _compeer_ of sulphur.\r\nAnd in his book on _Furnaces_, chapter 25 (or 28 in some copies), he\r\nexpressly mentions _metallic arsenic_ (_arsenicum metallinum_), in a\r\npreparation not very intelligible, but which he considered of great\r\nimportance. The white oxide of arsenic or arsenious acid, was obviously\r\nwell known to him. He gives more than one process for obtaining it by\r\nsublimation.[134] He observes in his Sum of Perfection, book i. part\r\niv. chap. 2, which treats of sublimation, “Arsenic, which before its\r\nsublimation was evil and prone to adustion, after its sublimation,\r\nsuffers not itself to be inflamed; but only resides without\r\ninflammation.”\r\n\r\n[134] Invention of Verity, chap. 7.\r\n\r\nGeber states the fact, that when arsenic is heated with copper that\r\nmetal becomes white.[135] He gives also a process by which the white\r\narseniate of iron is obviously made. “Grind one pound of iron filings\r\nwith half a pound of sublimed arsenic (arsenious acid). Imbibe the\r\nmixture with the water of saltpetre, and salt-alkali, repeating this\r\nimbibation thrice. Then make it flow with a violent fire, and you will\r\nhave your iron white. Repeat this labour till it flow sufficiently with\r\npeculiar dealbation.”[136]\r\n\r\n[135] Sum of Perfection, book ii. part. ii. chap. 11.\r\n\r\n[136] Invention of Verity, chap. 14.\r\n\r\n16. He mentions oxide of copper under the name of _æs ustum_, the red\r\noxide of iron under the name of _crocus_ of iron. He mentions also\r\nlitharge and red lead.[137] But as all these substances were known to\r\nthe Greeks and Romans, it is needless to enter into any particular\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\n[137] Ibid., chap. 4 and 12.\r\n\r\n17. I am not sure what substance Geber understood by the word\r\n_marchasite_. It was a substance which must have been abundant, and in\r\ncommon use, for he refers to it frequently, and uses it in many of his\r\nprocesses; but he nowhere informs us what it is. I suspect it may have\r\nbeen sulphuret of antimony, which was certainly in common use in Asia\r\nlong before the time of Geber. But he also makes mention of antimony\r\nby name, or at least the Latin translator has made use of the word\r\n_antimonium_. When speaking of the reduction of metals after heating\r\nthem with sulphur, he says, “The reduction of tin is converted into\r\nclear antimony; but of lead, into a dark-coloured antimony, as we have\r\nfound by proper experience.”[138] It is not easy to conjecture what\r\nmeaning the word antimony is intended to convey in this passage. In\r\nanother passage he says, “Antimony is calcined, dissolved, clarified,\r\ncongealed, and ground to powder, so it is prepared.”[139]\r\n\r\n[138] Sum of Perfection, book ii. part iii. chap. 10.\r\n\r\n[139] Invention of Verity, chap. 4.\r\n\r\n18. Geber’s description of the metals is tolerably accurate,\r\nconsidering the time when he wrote. As an example I shall subjoin his\r\naccount of gold. “Gold is a metallic body, yellow, ponderous, mute,\r\nfulged, equally digested in the bowels of the earth, and very long\r\nwashed with mineral water; under the hammer extensible, fusible, and\r\nsustaining the trial of the cupel and cementation.”[140] He gives an\r\nexample of copper being changed into gold. “In copper-mines,” he says,\r\n“we see a certain water which flows out, and carries with it thin\r\nscales of copper, which (by a continual and long-continued course) it\r\nwashes and cleanses. But after such water ceases to flow, we find these\r\nthin scales with the dry sand, in three years time to be digested with\r\nthe heat of the sun; and among these scales the purest gold is found:\r\ntherefore we judge those scales were cleansed by the benefit of the\r\nwater, but were equally digested by heat of the sun, in the dryness of\r\nthe sand, and so brought to equality.”[141] Here we have an example of\r\nplausible reasoning from defective premises. The gold grains doubtless\r\nexisted in the sand before, while the scales of copper in the course of\r\nthree years would be oxidized and converted into powder, and disappear,\r\nor at least lose all their metallic lustre.\r\n\r\n[140] Sum of Perfection, book i. part iii. chap. 8.\r\n\r\n[141] Ibid., book i. part iii. chap. 8.\r\n\r\nSuch are the most remarkable chemical facts which I have observed in\r\nthe works of Geber. They are so numerous and important, as to entitle\r\nhim with some justice to the appellation of the father and founder of\r\nchemistry. Besides the metals, sulphur and salt, with which the Greeks\r\nand Romans were acquainted, he knew the method of preparing sulphuric\r\nacid, nitric acid, and aqua regia. He knew the method of dissolving\r\nthe metals by means of these acids, and actually prepared nitrate of\r\nsilver and corrosive sublimate. He was acquainted with potash and\r\nsoda, both in the state of carbonates and caustic. He was aware that\r\nthese alkalies dissolve sulphur, and he employed the process to obtain\r\nsulphur in a state of purity.\r\n\r\nBut notwithstanding the experimental merit of Geber, his spirit of\r\nphilosophy did not much exceed that of his countrymen. He satisfied\r\nhimself with accounting for phenomena by occult causes, as was the\r\nuniversal custom of the Arabians; a practice quite inconsistent with\r\nreal scientific progress. That this was the case will appear from the\r\nfollowing passage, in which Geber attempts to give an explanation\r\nof the properties of the _great elixir_ or _philosopher’s stone_:\r\n“Therefore, let him attend to the properties and ways of action of\r\nthe composition of the greater elixir. For we endeavour to make one\r\nsubstance, yet compounded and composed of many, so permanently fixed,\r\nthat being put upon the fire, the fire cannot injure; and that it may\r\nbe mixed with metals in flux and flow with them, and enter with that\r\nwhich in them is of an ingressible substance, and be fermented with\r\nthat which in them is of a permixable substance; and be consolidated\r\nwith that which in them is of a consolidable substance; and be\r\nfixed with that which in them is of a fixable substance; and not be\r\nburnt by those things which burn not gold and silver; and take away\r\nconsolidation and weights with due ignition.”[142]\r\n\r\n[142] Investigation of Perfections, chap. 11.\r\n\r\nThe next Arabian whose name I shall introduce into this history, is\r\nAl-Hassain-Abou-Ali-Ben-Abdallah-Ebn-Sina, surnamed Scheik Reyes, or\r\nprince of physicians, vulgarly known by the name of _Avicenna_. Next to\r\nAristotle and Galen, his reputation was the highest, and his authority\r\nthe greatest of all medical practitioners; and he reigned paramount, or\r\nat least shared the medical sceptre till he was hurled from his throne\r\nby the rude hands of Paracelsus.\r\n\r\nAvicenna was born in the year 978, at Bokhara, to which place his\r\nfather had retired during the emirate of the calif Nuhh, one of the\r\nsons of the celebrated Almansor. Ali, his father, had dwelt in Balkh,\r\nin the Chorazan. After the birth of Avicenna he went to Asschena in\r\nBucharia, where he continued to live till his son had reached his\r\nfifteenth year. No labour nor expense was spared on the education of\r\nAvicenna, whose abilities were so extraordinary that he is said to\r\nhave been able to repeat the whole Koran by heart at the age of ten\r\nyears. Ali gave him for a master Abou-Abdallah-Annatholi, who taught\r\nhim grammar, dialectics, the geometry of Euclid, and the astronomy of\r\nPtolemy. But Avicenna quitted his tuition because he could not give him\r\nthe solution of a problem in logic. He attached himself to a merchant,\r\nwho taught him arithmetic, and made him acquainted with the Indian\r\nnumerals from which our own are derived. He then undertook a journey\r\nto Bagdad, where he studied philosophy under the great Peripatician,\r\nAbou-Nasr-Alfarabi, a disciple of Mesue the elder. At the same time\r\nhe applied himself to medicine, under the tuition of the Nestorian,\r\nAbou-Sahel-Masichi. He informs us himself that he applied with an\r\nextraordinary ardour to the study of the sciences. He was in the habit\r\nof drinking great quantities of liquids during the night, to prevent\r\nhim from sleeping; and he often obtained in a dream a solution of those\r\nproblems at which he had laboured in vain while he was awake. When the\r\ndifficulties to be surmounted appeared to him too great, he prayed to\r\nGod to communicate to him a share of his wisdom; and these prayers, he\r\nassures us, were never offered in vain. The metaphysics of Aristotle\r\nwas the only book which he could not comprehend, and after reading them\r\nover forty times, he threw them aside with great anger at himself.\r\n\r\nAlready, at the age of sixteen, he was a physician of eminence; and at\r\neighteen he performed a brilliant cure on the calif Nuhh, which gave\r\nhim such celebrity that Mohammed, Calif of Chorazan, invited him to his\r\npalace; but Avicenna rather chose to reside at Dschordschan, where he\r\ncured the nephew of the calif Kabus of a grievous distemper.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he went to Ray, where he was appointed physician to Prince\r\nMagd-Oddaula. Here he composed a dictionary of the sciences. Sometime\r\nafter this he was raised to the dignity of vizier at Hamdan; but he\r\nwas speedily deprived of his office and thrown into prison for having\r\nfavoured a sedition. While incarcerated he wrote many works on medicine\r\nand philosophy. By-and-by he was set at liberty, and restored to his\r\ndignity; but after the death of his protector, Schems-Oddaula, being\r\nafraid of a new attempt to deprive him of his liberty, he took refuge\r\nin the house of an apothecary, where he remained long concealed and\r\ncompletely occupied with his literary labours. Being at last discovered\r\nhe was thrown into the castle of Berdawa, where he was confined for\r\nfour months. At the end of that time a fortunate accident enabled\r\nhim to make his escape, in the disguise of a monk. He repaired to\r\nIspahan, where he lived much respected at the court of the calif\r\nOla-Oddaula. He did not live to a great age, because he had worn out\r\nhis constitution by too free an indulgence of women and wine. Having\r\nbeen attacked by a violent colic, he caused eight injections, prepared\r\nfrom long pepper, to be thrown up in one day. This excessive use of so\r\nirritating a remedy, occasioned an excoriation of the intestines, which\r\nwas followed by an attack of epilepsy. A journey to Hamdan, in company\r\nwith the calif, and the use of mithridate, into which his servant by\r\nmistake had put too much opium, contributed still further to put an end\r\nto his life. He had scarcely arrived at the town when he died in the\r\nfifty-eighth year of his age, in the year 1036.\r\n\r\nAvicenna was the author of the immense work entitled “Canon,” which\r\nwas translated into Latin, and for five centuries constituted the\r\ngreat standard, the infallible guide, the confession of faith of the\r\nmedical world. All medical knowledge was contained in it; and nothing\r\nexcept what was contained in it was considered by medical men as of any\r\nimportance. When we take a view of the Canon, and compare it with the\r\nwritings of the Greeks, and even of the Arabians, that preceded it, we\r\nshall find some difficulty in accounting for the unbounded authority\r\nwhich he acquired over the medical world, and for the length of time\r\nduring which that authority continued.\r\n\r\nBut it must be remembered, that Avicenna’s reign occupies the darkest\r\nand most dreary period of the history of the human mind. The human\r\nrace seems to have been asleep, and the mental faculties in a state\r\nof complete torpor. Mankind, accustomed in their religious opinions\r\nto obey blindly the infallible decisions of the church, and to think\r\nprecisely as the church enjoined them to think, would naturally\r\nlook for some means to save them the trouble of thinking on medical\r\nsubjects; and this means they found fortunately in the canons of\r\nAvicenna. These canons, in their opinion, were equally infallible with\r\nthe decisions of the holy father, and required to be as implicitly\r\nobeyed. The whole science of medicine was reduced to a simple perusal\r\nof Avicenna’s Canon, and an implicit adherence to his rules and\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare this celebrated work with the medical writings of the\r\nGreeks, and even of the Arabians, the predecessors of Avicenna, we\r\nshall be surprised that it contains little or nothing which can be\r\nconsidered as original; the whole is borrowed from the writings of\r\nGalen, or Ætius, or Rhazes: scarcely ever does he venture to trust his\r\nown wings, but rests entirely on the sagacity of his Greek and Arabian\r\npredecessors. Galen is his great guide; or, if he ever forsake him, it\r\nis to place himself under the direction of Aristotle.\r\n\r\nThe Canon contains a collection of most of the valuable information\r\ncontained in the writings of the ancient Greek physicians, arranged,\r\nit must be allowed, with great clearness. The Hhawi of Razes is almost\r\nas complete; but it wants the _lucidus ordo_ which distinguishes the\r\nCanon of Avicenna. I conceive that the high reputation which Avicenna\r\nacquired, was owing to the care which he bestowed upon his arrangement.\r\nHe was undoubtedly a man of abilities, but not of inventive genius.\r\nThere is little original matter in the Canon. But the physicians in the\r\nwest, while Avicenna occupied the medical sceptre, had no opportunity\r\nof judging of the originality of their oracle, because they were\r\nunacquainted with the Greek language, and could not therefore consult\r\nthe writings of Galen or Ætius, except through the corrupt medium of an\r\nArabian version.\r\n\r\nBut it is not the medical reputation of Avicenna that induced me to\r\nmention his name here. Like all the Arabian physicians, he was also a\r\nchemist; and his chemical tracts having been translated into Latin, and\r\npublished in Western Europe, we are enabled to judge of their merit,\r\nand to estimate the effect which they may have had upon the progress\r\nof chemistry. The first Latin translation of the chemical writings of\r\nAvicenna was published at Basil in 1572; they consist of two separate\r\nbooks; the first, under the name of “Porta Elementorum,” consists of a\r\ndialogue between a master and his pupil, respecting the mysteries of\r\nAlchymy. He gives an account of the four elements, fire, air, water,\r\nearth, and gives them their usual qualities of dry, moist, hot, and\r\ncold. He then treats of air, which, he says, is the food of fire, of\r\nwater, of honey, of the mutual conversion of the elements into each\r\nother; of milk and cheese, of the mixture of fire and water, and that\r\nall things are composed of the four elements. There is nothing in\r\nthis tract which has any pretension to novelty; he merely retails the\r\nopinions of the Greek philosophers.\r\n\r\nThe other treatise is much larger, and professes to teach the whole\r\nart of alchymy; it is divided into ten parts, entitled “Dictiones.”\r\nThe first diction treats of the philosopher’s stone in general; the\r\nsecond diction treats of the method of converting light things into\r\nheavy, hard things into soft; of the mutation of the elements; and of\r\nsome other particulars of a nature not very intelligible. The third\r\ndiction treats of the formation of the elixir; and the same subject is\r\ncontinued in the fourth.\r\n\r\nThe fifth diction is one of the most important in the whole treatise;\r\nit is in general intelligible, which is more than can be said of those\r\nthat precede it. This diction is divided into twenty-eight chapters:\r\nthe first chapter treats of copper, which, he says, is of three kinds;\r\npermenian copper, natural copper, and Navarre copper. But of these\r\nthree varieties he gives no account whatever; though he enlarges a good\r\ndeal on the qualities of copper--not its properties, but its supposed\r\nmedicinal action. It is hot and dry, he says, but in the calx of it\r\nthere is humidity. His account of the composition of copper is the same\r\nwith that of Geber.\r\n\r\nThe second chapter treats of lead, the third of tin, and in the\r\nremaining chapters he treats successively of brass, iron, gold, silver,\r\nmarcasite, sulphuret of antimony, which is distinguished by the name of\r\nalcohol; of soda, which he says is the juice of a plant called _sosa_.\r\nAnd he gives an unintelligible process by which it is extracted from\r\nthat plant, without mentioning a syllable about the combustion to which\r\nit is obvious that it must have been subjected.\r\n\r\nIn the twelfth chapter he treats of saltpetre, which, he says, is\r\nbrought from Sicily, from India, from Egypt, and from Herminia. He\r\ndescribes several varieties of it, but mentions nothing about its\r\ncharacteristic property of deflagrating upon burning coals. He then\r\ntreats successively of common salt, of sal-gem, of vitriol, of sulphur,\r\nof orpiment, and of sal ammoniac, which, he says, comes from Egypt,\r\nfrom India, and from Forperia. In the nineteenth and subsequent\r\nchapters he treats of aurum vivum, of hair, of urine, of eggs, of\r\nblood, of glass, of white linen, of horse-dung, and of vinegar.\r\n\r\nThe sixth diction, in thirty-three chapters, treats of the calcination\r\nof the metals, of sublimation, and of some other processes. I think it\r\nunnecessary to be more particular, because I cannot perceive any thing\r\nin it that had not been previously treated of by Geber.\r\n\r\nThe seventh diction treats of the preparation of blood and eggs, and\r\nthe method of dividing them into their four elements. It treats also\r\nof the elixir of silver, and the elixir of gold; but it contains no\r\nchemical fact of any importance.\r\n\r\nThe eighth diction treats of the preparation of the ferment of silver,\r\nand of gold. The ninth diction treats of the whole magistery, and of\r\nthe nuptials of the sun and moon; that is, of gold and silver. The\r\ntenth diction treats of weights.\r\n\r\nThe chemical writings of Avicenna are of little value, and apply\r\nchemistry rather to the supposed medical qualities of the different\r\nsubstances treated of, than to the advancement of the science. All\r\nthe chemical knowledge which he possesses is obviously drawn from\r\nGeber. Geber, then, may be looked upon as the only chemist among the\r\nArabians to whom we are indebted for any real improvements and new\r\nfacts. It is true that the Arabian physicians improved considerably the\r\nmateria medica of the Greeks, and introduced many valuable medicines\r\ninto common use which were unknown before their time. It is enough\r\nto mention corrosive sublimate, manna, opium, asafœtida. It would\r\nbe difficult to make out many of the vegetable substances used by\r\nthe Arabian chemists; because the plants which they designated by\r\nparticular names, can very seldom be identified. Botany at that time\r\nhad made so little progress, that no method was known of describing\r\nplants so as to enable other persons to determine what they were.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nOF THE PROGRESS OF CHEMISTRY UNDER PARACELSUS AND HIS DISCIPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto we have witnessed only the first rude beginnings, or, as\r\nit were, the early dawn of the chemical day. It is from the time of\r\nParacelsus that the true commencement of chemical investigations is to\r\nbe dated. Not that Paracelsus or his followers understood the nature\r\nof the science, or undertook any regular or successful investigation.\r\nBut Paracelsus shook the medical throne of Galen and Avicenna to its\r\nvery foundation; he roused the latent energies of the human mind, which\r\nhad for so long a period lain torpid; he freed medical men from those\r\ntrammels, and put an end to that despotism which had existed for five\r\ncenturies. He pointed out the importance of chemical medicines, and\r\nof chemical investigations, to the physician. This led many laborious\r\nmen to turn their attention to the subject. Those metals which were\r\nconsidered as likely to afford useful medicines, mercury for example,\r\nand antimony, were exposed to the action of an infinite number of\r\nreagents, and a prodigious collection of new products obtained and\r\nintroduced into medicine. Some of these were better, and some worse,\r\nthan the preparations formerly employed; but all of them led to an\r\nincrease of the stock of chemical knowledge, which now began to\r\naccumulate with considerable rapidity. It will be proper, therefore,\r\nto give a somewhat particular account of the life and opinions\r\nof Paracelsus, so far as they can be made out from his writings,\r\nbecause, though he was not himself a scientific chemist, he may be\r\ntruly considered as the man through whose means the stock of chemical\r\nknowledge was accumulated, which was afterwards, by the ingenuity of\r\nBeccher, and Stahl, moulded into a scientific form.\r\n\r\nPhilippus Aureolus Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombast ab Hohenheim (as\r\nhe denominates himself) was born at Einsideln, two German miles from\r\nZurich. His father was called William Bombast von Hohenheim. He was\r\na very near relation of George Bombast von Hohenheim, who became\r\nafterwards grand master of the order of Johannites. William Bombast\r\nvon Hohenheim practised medicine at Einsideln.[143] After receiving\r\nthe first rudiments of his education in his native city, he became\r\na wandering scholastic, as was then the custom with poor scholars.\r\nHe wandered from province to province, predicting the future by the\r\nposition of the stars, and the lines on the hand, and exhibiting\r\nall the chemical processes which he had learned from founders and\r\nalchymists. For his initiation in alchymy, astrology, and medicine,\r\nhe was indebted to his father, who was much devoted to these three\r\nsciences. Paracelsus mentions also the names of several ecclesiastics\r\nfrom whom he received chemical information; among others, Tritheimius,\r\nabbot of Spanheim; Bishop Scheit, of Stettbach; Bishop Erhart, of\r\nLaventall; Bishop Nicolas, of Hippon; and Bishop Matthew Schacht.\r\nHe seems also to have served some years as an army surgeon, for he\r\nmentions many cures which he performed in the Low Countries, in the\r\nStates of the Church, in the kingdom of Naples, and during the wars\r\nagainst the Venetians, the Danes, and the Dutch.\r\n\r\n[143] See Testamentum Paracelsi, passim.\r\n\r\nThere is some uncertainty whether he received a regular college\r\neducation, as was then the practice with all medical men. He\r\nacknowledges himself that his medical antagonists reproached him with\r\nnever having frequented their schools; and he is perpetually affirming,\r\nthat a physician should receive all his knowledge from God, and not\r\nfrom man. But if we can trust his own assertions, there can be no doubt\r\nthat he took a regular medical degree, which implies a regular college\r\neducation. He tells us, in his preface to his Chirurgia Magna, that he\r\nvisited the universities of Germany, France, and Italy. He assures his\r\nreaders, that he was the ornament of the schools where he studied. He\r\neven speaks of the oath which he was obliged to take when he received\r\nhis medical degree; but where he studied, or where and when he received\r\nhis medical degree, are questions which neither Paracelsus nor his\r\ndisciples, nor his biographers, have enabled us to solve. If he ever\r\nattended a university, he must have neglected his studies, otherwise he\r\ncould not have been ignorant, as he confessedly was, of the very first\r\nelements of the most common kinds of knowledge. But if he neglected the\r\nuniversities, he laboured long and assiduously with the rich Sigismond\r\nFuggerus, of Schwartz, in order to learn the true secret of forming the\r\nphilosopher’s stone.\r\n\r\nHe gives us some details of the numerous journeys that he made, as\r\nwas customary with the alchymists of the time, into the mountains of\r\nBohemia, the East, and Sweden, to inspect the mines, to get himself\r\ninitiated into the mysteries of the eastern adepts, to inspect the\r\nwonders of nature, and to view the celebrated diamond mountain, the\r\nposition of which, however, he unfortunately forgets to specify.\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his Chirurgia Magna, he informs us that he traversed\r\nSpain, Portugal, England, Prussia, Poland, and Transylvania; where he\r\nnot only profited by the information of the medical men with whom he\r\nbecame acquainted, but that he drew much precious information from\r\nold women, gipsies, conjurors, and chemists.[144] He spent several\r\nyears in Hungary; and informs us that at Weissenburg, in Croatia, and\r\nin Stockholm, he was taught by several old women to prepare drinks\r\ncapable of curing ulcers. He is said also to have made a voyage into\r\nEgypt, and even into Tartary; and he accompanied the son of the Kan\r\nof the Tartars to Constantinople, in order to learn the secret of the\r\nphilosopher’s stone from Trismogin, who inhabited that capital. This\r\nprodigious activity, this constant motion from place to place, left\r\nhim but little leisure for reading: accordingly he informs us himself,\r\nthat during the space of ten years he never opened a book, and that his\r\nwhole library consisted only of six sheets. The inventory of his books,\r\ndrawn up after his death, confirms this recital; for they consisted\r\nonly of the Bible, the Concordance to the Bible, the New Testament, and\r\nthe Commentaries of St. Jerome on the Evangelists.\r\n\r\n[144] “Hispania, Portugallia, Anglia, Borussia, Lithuania, Polonia,\r\nPannonia, Valachia, Transylvania, Croatia, Illyrico, immo omnibus\r\ntotius Europæ nationibus peragratis, undeque non solum apud medicos,\r\nsed et chirurgos, tonsores, aniculas, magos, chymistas, nobiles ac\r\nignobiles, optima, selectiora ac secretiora, quæ uspiam extarent\r\nremedia, inquisivi acriter.”--_Præfatio Chirurgiæ Magnæ._ Opera\r\nParacelsi, tom. iii.\r\n\r\nWe know not at what period he returned back to Germany; but at the\r\nage of thirty-three the great number of fortunate cures which he had\r\nperformed rendered him an object of admiration to the people, and\r\nof jealousy to the rival physicians of the time. He assures us that\r\nhe cured eighteen princes whose diseases had been aggravated by the\r\npractitioners devoted to the system of Galen. Among others he cured\r\nPhilip, Margrave of Baden, of a dysentery, who promised him a great\r\nreward, but did not keep his promise, and even treated him in a way\r\nunworthy of that prince. This cure, however, and others of a similar\r\nnature, added greatly to his celebrity; and in order to raise his\r\nreputation to the highest possible pitch, he announced publicly that he\r\nwas able to cure all the diseases hitherto reckoned incurable; and that\r\nhe had discovered an elixir, by means of which the life of man might be\r\nprolonged at pleasure to any extent whatever. He began the practice,\r\nwhich has since been so successfully followed in this country, of\r\ndispensing medicines gratuitously to the poor, in order to induce the\r\nrich to apply to him for assistance when they were overtaken with\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1526 Paracelsus was appointed professor of physic and\r\nsurgery in the University of Basil. This appointment was given him,\r\nit is said, by the recommendation of Œcolampadius. He introduced the\r\ncustom of lecturing in the common language of the country, as is at\r\npresent the universal practice: but during the time of Paracelsus, and\r\nlong after indeed, all lectures were delivered in Latin. The new method\r\nwhich he followed in explaining the theory and practice of the art;\r\nthe numerous fortunate cures which he stated in confirmation of his\r\nmethod of treatment; the emphasis with which he spoke of his secrets\r\nfor prolonging life, and for curing every kind of disease without\r\ndistinction, but still more his lecturing in a language which was\r\nunderstood by the whole population, drew to Bâle an immense crowd of\r\nidle, enthusiastic, and credulous hearers.\r\n\r\nThe lectures which he delivered on Practical Medicine still remain,\r\nwritten in a confused mixture of German and barbarous Latin, and\r\ncontaining little or nothing except a farrago of empirical remedies,\r\nadvanced with the greatest confidence. They have a much greater\r\nresemblance to a collection of quack advertisements than to the sober\r\nlectures of a professor in a university. In the month of November,\r\n1526, he wrote to Christopher Clauser, a physician in Zurich, that\r\nas Hippocrates was the first physician among the Greeks, Avicenna\r\namong the Arabians, Galen among the Pergamenians, and Marsilius among\r\nthe Italians, so he was beyond dispute the greatest physician among\r\nthe Germans. Every country produces an illustrious physician, whose\r\nmedicines are adapted to the climate in which he lived, but not suited\r\nto other countries. The remedies of Hippocrates were good to the\r\nGreeks, but not suitable to the Germans; thus it was necessary that\r\nan inspired physician should spring up in every country, and that he\r\nwas the person destined to teach the Germans the art of curing all\r\ndiseases.[145]\r\n\r\n[145] See the dedication to his treatise _De Gradibus et\r\nCompositionibus Receptorum et Naturalium_. Opera Paracelsi, vol. ii.\r\np. 144. I always refer to the folio edition of Paracelsus’s works, in\r\nthree volumes, published at Geneva in 1658, by M. de Tournes, which is\r\nthe edition in my possession.\r\n\r\nParacelsus began his professorial career by burning publicly, in his\r\nclass-room, and in the presence of his pupils, the works of Galen\r\nand Avicenna, assuring his hearers that the strings of his shoes\r\npossessed more knowledge than those two celebrated physicians. All the\r\nuniversities united had not, he assured them, as much knowledge as was\r\ncontained in his own beard, and the hairs upon his neck were better\r\ninformed than all the writers that ever existed put together. To give\r\nthe reader an idea of the arrogant absurdity of his pretensions, I\r\nshall translate a few sentences of the preface to his tract, entitled\r\n“Paragranum,” where he indulges in his usual strain of rodomontade:\r\n“Me, me you shall follow, you Avicenna, you Galen, you Rhazes, you\r\nMontagnana, you Mesue. I shall not follow you, but you shall follow me.\r\nYou, I say, you inhabitants of Paris, you inhabitants of Montpelier,\r\nyou Suevi, you Misnians, you inhabitants of Cologne, you inhabitants of\r\nVienna; all you whom the Rhine and the Danube nourish, you who inhabit\r\nthe islands of the sea; you also Italy, you Dalmatia, you Athens, you\r\nGreek, you Arabian, you Israelite--I shall not follow you, but you\r\nshall follow me. Nor shall any one lurk in the darkest and most remote\r\ncorner whom the dogs shall not piss upon. I shall be the monarch, the\r\nmonarchy shall be mine. If I administer, and I bind up your loins, is\r\nhe with whom you are at present delighted a Cacophrastus? This ordure\r\nmust be eaten by you.”\r\n\r\n“What will your opinion be when you see your Cacophrastus constituted\r\nthe chief of the monarchy? What will you think when you see the sect\r\nof Theophrastus leading on a solemn triumph, if I make you pass under\r\nthe yoke of my philosophy? your Pliny will you call Cacopliny, and your\r\nAristotle, Cacoaristotle? If I plunge them together with your Porphyry,\r\nAlbertus, &c., and the whole of their compatriots into my _necessary_.”\r\nBut the terms become now so coarse and indelicate, that I cannot bring\r\nmyself to proceed further with the translation. Enough has been given\r\nto show the extreme arrogance and folly of Paracelsus.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, was this impudence and grossness from injuring the\r\ninterest of Paracelsus, that we are assured by Ramus and Urstisius\r\nthat it contributed still further to increase it. The coarseness\r\nof his language was well suited to the vulgarity of the age; and\r\nhis arrogance and boasting were considered, as usual, as a proof of\r\nsuperior merit. The cure which he performed on Frobenius, drew the\r\nattention of Erasmus himself, who consulted him about the diseases\r\nwith which he was afflicted; and the letters that passed between them\r\nare still preserved. The epistle of Paracelsus is short, enigmatical,\r\nand unintelligible; that of Erasmus is distinguished by that clearness\r\nand elegance which characterize his writings.[146] But Frobenius died\r\nin the month of October, 1527, and the antagonists of Paracelsus\r\nattributed his death (and probably with justice) to the violent\r\nremedies which had been administered to a man whose constitution had\r\nbeen destroyed by the gout.\r\n\r\n[146] Opera Paracelsi, i. 485.\r\n\r\nHis death contributed not a little to tarnish the glory of Paracelsus:\r\nbut he suffered the greatest injury from the habits of intoxication\r\nin which he indulged, and from the vulgarity of the way in which he\r\nspent his time. He hardly ever went into his class-room to deliver\r\na lecture till he was half intoxicated, and scarcely ever dictated\r\nto his secretaries till he had lost the use of his reason by a too\r\nliberal indulgence in wine. If he was summoned to visit a patient, he\r\nscarcely ever went but in a state of intoxication. Not unfrequently he\r\npassed the whole night in the alehouse, in the company of peasants,\r\nand when morning came, was quite incapable of performing the duties\r\nof his station. On one occasion, after a debauch, which lasted the\r\nwhole night, he was called next morning to visit a patient; on\r\nentering the room, he inquired if the sick person had taken any thing:\r\n“Nothing,” was the answer, “except the body of our Lord.” “Since you\r\nhave already,” says he, “provided yourself with another physician, my\r\npresence here is unnecessary,” and he left the apartment instantly.\r\nWhen Albertus Basa, physician to the king of Poland, visited Paracelsus\r\nin the city of Basel, he carried him to see a patient whose strength\r\nwas completely exhausted, and which, in his opinion, it was impossible\r\nto restore; but Paracelsus, wishing to make a parade of his skill,\r\nadministered to him three drops of his laudanum, and invited him to\r\ndine with him next day.[147] The invitation was accepted, and the sick\r\nman dined next day with his physician.\r\n\r\n[147] There were two laudanums of Paracelsus; one was _red oxide of\r\nmercury_, the other consisted of the following substances: Chloride\r\nof antimony, 1 ounce; hepatic aloes, 1 ounce; rose-water, ½ ounce;\r\nsaffron, 3 ounces; ambergris, 2 drams. All these well mixed.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the year 1527 a disgraceful dispute into which he\r\nentered brought his career, as a professor, to a sudden termination.\r\nThe canon Cornelius, of Lichtenfels, who had been long a martyr to\r\nthe gout, employed him as his physician, and promised him one hundred\r\nflorins if he could cure him. Paracelsus made him take three pills of\r\nlaudanum, and having thus freed him from pain, demanded the sum agreed\r\nupon; but Lichtenfels refused to pay him the whole of it. Paracelsus\r\nsummoned him before the court, and the magistrate of Basle decided\r\nthat the canon was bound to pay only the regular price of the medicine\r\nadministered. Irritated at this decision, our intoxicated professor\r\nuttered a most violent invective against the magistrate, who threatened\r\nto punish him for his outrageous conduct. His friends advised him to\r\nsave himself by flight. He took their advice, and thus abdicated his\r\nprofessorship. But, by this time, his celebrity as a teacher had been\r\nso completely destroyed by his foolish and immoral conduct, that he\r\nhad lost all his hearers. In consequence of this state of things, his\r\nflight from Basle produced no sensation whatever in that university.\r\n\r\nParacelsus betook himself, in the first place, to Alsace, and sent\r\nfor his faithful follower, the bookseller, Operinus, together with\r\nthe whole of his chemical apparatus. In 1528 we find him at Colmar,\r\nwhere he recommenced his ambulating life of a theosophist, which he\r\nhad led during his youth. His book upon syphilis, known at that time\r\nby the name of Morbus Gallicus, was dedicated at Colmar, to the chief\r\nmagistrate of Colmar, Hieronymus Bonerus.[148] In 1531 he was at\r\nSaint-Gallen; in 1535, at Pfeffersbade, and in 1536, at Augsburg, where\r\nhe dedicated his Chirurgia Magna to Malhausen. At the request of John\r\nde Leippa, Marshal of Bohemia, he undertook a journey into Moravia;\r\nas that nobleman, having been informed that Paracelsus understood\r\nthe method of curing the gout radically, was anxious to put himself\r\nunder his care. Paracelsus lived for a long time at Kroman, and its\r\nenvirons. John de Leippa, instead of receiving any benefit from the\r\nmedicines administered to him, became daily worse, and at last died.\r\nThis was the fate also of the lady of Zerotin, in whom the remedies of\r\nParacelsus produced no fewer than twenty-four epileptic fits in one\r\nday. Paracelsus, instead of waiting the disgrace with which the death\r\nof this lady would have overwhelmed him, announced his intention of\r\ngoing to Vienna, that he might see how they would treat him in that\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n[148] Opera Paracelsi, iii, 101.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that from Vienna he went into Hungary; but in 1538, we find\r\nhim in Villach, where he dedicated his Chronica et Origo Carinthiæ\r\nto the states of Carinthia.[149] His book, De Natura Rerum, had\r\nbeen dedicated to Winkelstein, and the dedication is dated also at\r\nVillach, in the year 1537.[150] In 1540 he was at Mindelheim, and in\r\n1541, at Strasburg, where he died, in St. Stephen’s hospital, in the\r\nforty-eighth year of his age.\r\n\r\n[149] Opera Paracelsi, i. 243.\r\n\r\n[150] Ibid., ii. 84.\r\n\r\nTo form an accurate idea of this most extraordinary man, we must attend\r\nto his habits, and to the situation in which he was placed. He had\r\nacquired such a habit of moving about, that he assures us himself he\r\nfound it impossible for him to continue for any length of time in one\r\nplace. He was always surrounded by a number of followers, whom neither\r\nhis habits of intoxication, nor the foolish and immoral conduct in\r\nwhich he was accustomed to indulge, could induce to forsake him. The\r\nmost celebrated of these was Operinus, a printer at Basle, on whom\r\nParacelsus lavishes the most excessive praises, in his book De Morbo\r\nGallico. But Operinus loaded his master with obloquy, being provoked\r\nat him because he had not made him acquainted with the secret of the\r\nphilosopher’s stone, as he had promised to do. We must therefore be\r\ncautious in believing the stories that he relates to the discredit of\r\nhis master. We know the names of two others of his followers; Francis,\r\nwho assures us that Paracelsus was devoted to the transmutation of\r\nmetals; and George Vetter, who considered him as a magician; as was the\r\nopinion also of Operinus. Paracelsus himself, speaks of Dr. Cornelius,\r\nwhom he calls his secretary, and in honour of whom he wrote several\r\nof his libels. Other libels are dedicated to Doctors Peter, Andrew,\r\nand Ursinus, to the licentiate Pancrace, and to Mr. Raphael. On this\r\noccasion he complains bitterly of the infidelity of his servants, who,\r\nhe says, had succeeded in stealing from him several of his secrets;\r\nand had by this means been enabled to establish their reputation. He\r\naccuses equally the barbers and bathers that followed him, and is no\r\nless severe upon the physicians of every country through which he\r\ntravelled.\r\n\r\nWhen we attempt to form an accurate conception of the medical and\r\nphilosophical opinions of this singular man, we find ourselves beset\r\nwith almost insurmountable difficulties. His statements are so much\r\nat variance with each other, in his different pieces, and so much\r\nconfusion reigns with respect to the order of publication, that we know\r\nnot what to fix on as his last and maturest opinions. His style is\r\nexecrable; filled with new words of his own coining, and of mysticisms\r\neither introduced to excite the admiration of the ignorant, or from\r\nthe fanaticism and credulity of the writer, who was undoubtedly, to a\r\nconsiderable extent, the dupe of his own impostures. That he was in\r\npossession of the philosopher’s stone, or of a medicine capable of\r\nprolonging life to an indefinite length, as he all along asserted, he\r\ncould not himself believe; but he had boasted so long and so loudly of\r\nhis wonderful cures, and of the efficacy of his medicines, that there\r\ncan be no doubt that he ultimately placed implicit faith in them. The\r\nblunders of the transcribers whom he employed to copy his works, may\r\nperhaps account for some of the contradictions which they contain.\r\nBut how can we look for a regular system of opinions from a man who\r\ngenerally dictated his works when in a state of intoxication, and thus\r\nlaboured under an almost constant deprivation of reason.\r\n\r\nHis obscurity was partly the effect of design, and no doubt was\r\nintended to exalt the notions entertained of his profundity. He uses\r\ncommon words in new significations, without giving any indication\r\nof the change which he introduced. Thus _anatomy_, in the writings\r\nof Paracelsus, signifies not the dissection of dead animals to\r\ndetermine their structure, but it means the nature, force, and\r\nmagical designation of a thing. And as, according to the Platonic and\r\nCabalistic theory, every earthly body is formed after the model of a\r\nheavenly body, Paracelsus calls _anatomy_ the knowledge of that model,\r\nof that ideal, or of that paradigm after which all things are created.\r\nHe terms the fundamental force of a thing _a star_, and defines alchymy\r\nthe art of drawing out the stars of metals. The star is the source of\r\nall knowledge. When we eat, we introduce into our bodies _the star_,\r\nwhich is then modified, and favours nutrition.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that many of his obscure and unintelligible expressions\r\nare the fruit of ignorance. Thus he uses the term _pagoyus_, instead\r\nof _paganus_. He gives the name of _pagoyæ_ to the four _entities_,\r\nor causes of diseases, founded on the influence of the stars, to the\r\nelementary qualities; to the occult qualities, and to the influence\r\nof spirits; because these had been already admitted by the _Pagans_.\r\nBut the fifth _entity_, or cause of disease, which has God immediately\r\nfor its author, is _non pagoya_. The _undimia_ of Paracelsus is our\r\n_œdema_; only he applies the name to every kind of dropsy. The Latin\r\nword _tonitru_, we find is declined by Paracelsus. Thus he says, _lapis\r\ntonitrui_. The well-known line of Ovid,\r\n\r\n    Tollere nodosam nescit medicina podagram,\r\n\r\nHe travestied into\r\n\r\n    Nescit tartaream Roades curare podagram.[151]\r\n\r\n[151] Opera Paracelsi, i. 328.\r\n\r\n_Roades_, he says, means medicines for horses; and if any person wishes\r\na more elegant verse, he may make it for himself.[152] He employs,\r\nalso, a great number of words to which no meaning whatever can be\r\nattached; and to which, in all probability, he himself had affixed none.\r\n\r\n[152] “Qui elegantiorem optat, ille eum condat.”--_Ibid._\r\n\r\nAs is the case with all fanatics, he treated with contempt every\r\nkind of knowledge acquired by labour and application; and boasted\r\nthat his wisdom was communicated to him directly by God Almighty.\r\nThe theosophist who is worthy of partaking of the divine light, has\r\nno occasion for adopting a positive religion, nor of subjecting\r\nhimself to any kind of religious ceremony. The divine light within,\r\nwhich assimilates him to the Deity, more than compensates for all\r\nthese vulgar usages, and raises the illuminated votary far above the\r\nbeggarly elements of external worship. Accordingly, Paracelsus has been\r\naccused of treating the public worship of the Deity with contempt. Not\r\nsatisfied with the plain sense of the book, he attempted to explain\r\nin a mystical manner the words and syllables of the Bible. He accused\r\nLuther of not going far enough. “Luther,” says he, “is not worthy of\r\nuntying the strings of my shoes: should I undertake a reformation,\r\nI would begin by sending the pope and the reformers themselves to\r\nschool.” God, says Paracelsus, is the first and most excellent of\r\nwriters. The Holy Scripture conducts us to all truth, and teaches us\r\nall things. But medicine, philosophy, and astronomy, are among the\r\nnumber of things. Therefore, when we want to know what magical medicine\r\nis, we must consult the Apocalypse. The Bible, with its paraphrases,\r\nis the key to the theory of diseases. It puts it in our power to\r\nunderstand St. John, who, like Daniel, Ezekiel, Moses, &c., was a\r\nmagician, a cabalist, a diviner. The first duty of a physician is to\r\nstudy the Cabala, without which he must every moment commit a thousand\r\nblunders. “Learn,” says he, “the cabalistic art, which includes under\r\nit all the others.” “Man invents nothing, the devil invents nothing;\r\nit is God alone who unveils to us the light of nature.” “God honoured\r\nat first with his illumination the blind pagans, Apollo, Æsculapius,\r\nMachaon, Podalirius, and Hippocrates, and imparted to them the genius\r\nof medicine; their successors were the sophists.” One would suppose,\r\nfrom this passage, that Paracelsus had read and studied Hippocrates,\r\nand that he held him in high estimation. But the commentaries which\r\nhe has left on some of the aphorisms, show evidently that he did not\r\neven understand the Greek physician. “The compassion of God,” says he,\r\n“is the only foundation of medical science, and not a knowledge of the\r\ngreat masters, or of the writings which they have left in Greek and\r\nLatin.” “God often acts in dreams by the light of nature, and points\r\nout to man the manner of curing diseases.” “This knowledge renders\r\nall those objects visible which would otherwise escape the sight;\r\nand when faith is joined with it, nothing is then impossible to the\r\ntheosophist, who may transport the ocean to the top of Mount Ætna, and\r\nOlympus into the Red Sea.” Paracelsus predicts that by the year 1590\r\nChristian theosophy would be generally spread over the world, and that\r\nthe Galenical schools would be almost or entirely overthrown.\r\n\r\nWe find in Paracelsus some traces of the opinions of the Gnostics and\r\nArians, who considered Christ as the first emanation of the Deity. He\r\ncalls the first man _parens hominis_; and makes all spirits emanate\r\nfrom him. He is the _limbus minor_, or the last creature, into whom\r\nenters the great _limbus_, or the seed of all the creatures, the\r\ninfinite being. All the sciences, and all the arts of man, are derived\r\nfrom this great _limbus_; and he who can sink himself in the little\r\n_limbus_, that is to say, in Adam, and who can communicate by faith\r\nwith Jesus Christ, may invoke all _spirits_. Those who owe their\r\nscience to this _limbus_, are the best informed; those who derive it\r\nfrom the stars, occupy the last rank; and those who owe it to the light\r\nof nature, are intermediate between the preceding. Jesus Christ, in his\r\ncapacity of _limbus minor_ and first man, being always an emanation of\r\nthe Divinity; and, consequently, a subordinate personage. These ideas\r\nexplain to us why Paracelsus passed for an Arian, and was supposed not\r\nto believe in the Divinity of Jesus Christ. He was of opinion that the\r\nfaithful performed miracles, and operated magical cures by their simple\r\nconfidence in God the Father, and not by their faith in Christ; but he\r\nadds, however, that we ought to pray to Jesus, in order to obtain his\r\nintercession.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding attempt to explain the opinions of Paracelsus, it\r\nwill be evident to the reader that he was both a fanatic and impostor,\r\nand that his theory (if such a name can be given to the reveries of\r\na drunkard), consisted in uniting medicine with the doctrines of the\r\nCabala. A few more observations will be necessary to develop his dogmas\r\nstill further.\r\n\r\nEvery body, in his opinion, and man in particular, is double,\r\nconsisting of a material and spiritual substance.[153] The\r\nspiritual, which may be called the _sideric_, results from the\r\ncelestial influences; and we may trace after it a figure capable of\r\nproducing all kinds of magical effects. When we can act upon the\r\nbody itself, we act at the same time upon the spiritual form by\r\ncharacters and conjurations.[154] Yet, in another passage, he blames\r\nall magical ceremonies, and ascribes them to want of faith. The\r\ncelestial intelligences impress upon material bodies certain signs,\r\nwhich manifest their influence. The perfection of art consists in\r\nunderstanding the meaning of these signs, and in determining from them\r\nthe nature, qualities, and essence of a body. Adam, the first man, had\r\na perfect knowledge of the Cabala; he could interpret the signatures\r\nof all things. It was this which enabled him to assign to the animals\r\nnames which suited them best. A man who renounces all sensuality, and\r\nis blindly obedient to the will of God, is capable of taking a share\r\nin the actions which celestial intelligences perform; and consequently\r\nis possessed of the philosopher’s stone. Never does he want any thing;\r\nall creatures in earth and in heaven are obedient to him; he can cure\r\nall diseases, and prolong his life as long as he pleases; because he\r\npossesses the tincture which Adam and the patriarch’s before the flood\r\nemployed to prolong the term of their existence.[155] Beelzebub, the\r\nchief of the demons, is also subject to the power of magic: and who can\r\nblame the theosophist for believing in the devil? He ought, however,\r\nto take care to prevent this malignant spirit from commanding him.\r\nParacelsus was often wont to say, “If God does not aid me, the devil\r\nwill help me.”\r\n\r\n[153] Archidoxorum, lib. i. Opera Paracelsi, ii. 4.\r\n\r\n[154] De longa Vita. Opera Paracelsi, ii. 46.\r\n\r\n[155] Archidoxorum, lib. viii. Opera Paracelsi, ii. 29. In this book\r\nhe gives the method of preparing the elixir of life. It seems to have\r\nbeen nothing else than a solution of _common salt_ in water; for the\r\nquintessence of gold, with which this solution was to be mixed, was\r\ndoubtless an imaginary substance.\r\n\r\nPantheism was one of the principal dogmas of the Cabala; and Paracelsus\r\nadopts it in all its grossness. He affirms perpetually that every thing\r\nis animated in the universe; that every thing which exists, eats,\r\ndrinks, and voids excrements: even minerals and liquids take food and\r\nvoid the digested remains of their nourishment.[156] This opinion\r\nleads necessarily to the admission of a great number of spiritual\r\nsubstances, intermediate between material and immaterial in every part\r\nof the sublunary world, in water, air, earth, and fire; who, as well\r\nas man, eat, drink, converse, beget children; but which approach pure\r\nspirits in this, that they are more transparent, and infinitely more\r\nagile than all other animal bodies. Man possesses a soul, of which\r\nthese pure spirits are destitute. Hence it happens that these spiritual\r\nsubstances are at once body and spirit without a soul. When they die\r\n(for like the human race they are subject to death), no soul remains.\r\nLike us they are exposed to diseases. Their names vary according to the\r\nplaces that they occupy. When they inhabit the air, they are called\r\n_sylphs_; when the water, _nymphs_; when the earth, _pigmies_; when the\r\nfire, _salamanders_.[157] The inhabitants of the waters are also called\r\n_undinæ_, and those of the fire _vulcani_. The sylphs approach nearest\r\nto our nature, as they live in the air like us. The sylphs, nymphs,\r\nand pigmies, sometimes obtain permission from God to make themselves\r\nvisible, to converse with men, to indulge in carnal pleasures, and\r\nto produce children. But the salamanders have no relation to man.\r\nThese spiritual beings are acquainted with the future, and capable of\r\nrevealing it to man. They appear under the form of _ignes fatui_. We\r\nhave also the history of the fairies and the giants; and are told how\r\nthese spiritual beings are the guardians of concealed treasures; and\r\nhow these sylphs, nymphs, pigmies, and salamanders, may be charmed, and\r\ntheir treasures taken from them.\r\n\r\n[156] Modus Pharmacandi. Opera Paracelsi, i. 811.\r\n\r\n[157] Liber de Nymphis, Sylphis, Pygmæis, et Salamandris, et de ceteris\r\nSpiritibus. Opera Paracelsi, ii. 388. If the reader can understand this\r\nsingular book, his sagacity will be greater than mine.\r\n\r\nThis division of man into body and spirit, and of the things of nature\r\ninto visible and invisible, has in all ages of the world, been adopted\r\nby fanatics, because it enabled them to explain the history of ghosts,\r\nand a thousand similar prejudices. Hence the distinction between soul\r\nand spirit, which is so very ancient; and hence the three following\r\nharmonies to which the successors of Paracelsus paid a particular\r\nattention:\r\n\r\n  _Soul_,     _Spirit_,   _Body_,\r\n  _Mercury_,  _Sulphur_,  _Salt_,\r\n  _Water_,    _Air_,      _Earth_.\r\n\r\nThe will and the imagination of man acts principally by means of the\r\nspirit. Hence the reason of the efficacy of sorcery and magic. The\r\n_nævi materni_ are the impressions of these _vice-men_, and Paracelsus\r\ncalls them _cocomica signa_. The _sideric_ body of man draws to him,\r\nby imagination, all that surrounds him, and particularly the stars,\r\non which it acts like a magnet. In this manner, women with child, and\r\nduring the regular period of monthly evacuation, having a diseased\r\nimagination, are not only capable of poisoning a mirror by their\r\nbreath, but of injuring the infants in their wombs, and even also of\r\npoisoning the moon. But it seems needless to continue this disagreeable\r\ndetail of the absurd and ridiculous opinions which Paracelsus has\r\nconsigned to us in his different tracts.\r\n\r\nThe Physiology of Paracelsus (if such a name can be applied to his\r\nreveries) is nothing else than an application of the laws of the\r\nCabala to the explanation of the functions of the body. There exists,\r\nhe assures us, an intimate connexion between the sun and the heart,\r\nthe moon and the brain, Jupiter and the liver, Saturn and the spleen,\r\nMercury and the lungs, Mars and the bile, Venus and the kidneys. In\r\nanother part of his works, he informs us that the sun acts on the\r\numbilicus and the middle parts of the abdomen, the moon on the spine,\r\nMercury on the bowels, Venus on the organs of generation, Mars on the\r\nface, Jupiter on the head, and Saturn on the extremities. The pulse is\r\nnothing else than the measure of the temperature of the body, according\r\nto the space of the six places which are in relation to the planets.\r\nTwo pulses under the sole of the feet belong to Saturn and Jupiter,\r\ntwo at the elbow to Mars and Venus, two in the temples to the moon and\r\nmercury. The pulse of the sun is found under the heart. The _macrocosm_\r\nhas also seven pulses, which are the revolutions of the seven planets,\r\nand the irregularity or intermittence of these pulses, is represented\r\nby the eclipses. The moon and Saturn are charged in the macrocosm with\r\nthickening the water, which causes it to congeal. In like manner the\r\nmoon of the microcosm, that is to say the brain, coagulates the blood.\r\nHence _melancholy persons_, whom Paracelsus calls _lunatics_, have a\r\nthick blood. We ought not to say of a man that he has such and such\r\na complexion; but that it is Mars, Venus, &c., so that a physician\r\nought to know the planets of the microcosm, the arctic and antarctic\r\npole, the meridian, the zodiac, the east and the west, before trying\r\nto explain the functions or cure the diseases.[158] This knowledge is\r\nacquired by a continual comparison of the macrocosm with the microcosm.\r\nWhat must have been the state of medicine at the time when Paracelsus\r\nwrote, when the propagator of such opinions could be reckoned one of\r\nthe greatest of its reformers?\r\n\r\n[158] Paragrani Alterius, tract. ii. Opera Paracelsi, i. 235. The\r\nreader who has the curiosity to consult this tract, will find abundance\r\nof similar stuff, which I did not think worth translating.\r\n\r\nThe system of Galen had for its principal basis the doctrine of\r\nthe four elements, _fire_, _air_, _water_, and _earth_. Paracelsus\r\nneglected these elements, and multiplied the substances of the\r\ndisease itself. He admits, strictly speaking, three or four elements;\r\nnamely, the _star_, the _root_, the _element_, the _sperm_, which\r\nhe distinguishes by the name of the _true seed_. All these elements\r\nwere originally confounded together in the _chaos_ or _yliados_. The\r\n_star_ is the active force which gives form to matter. The _stars_\r\nare reasonable beings addicted to sodomy and adultery, like other\r\ncreatures. Each of them draws at pleasure out of the _chaos_, the\r\nplant and the metal to which it has an affinity, and gives a _sideric_\r\nform to their _root_. There are two kinds of _seed_; the _sperm_\r\nis the vehicle of the true seed. It is engendered by speculation,\r\nby imagination, by the power of the _star_. The occult, invisible,\r\n_sideric_ body produces the _true seed_, and the Adamic man secretes\r\nonly the visible envelope of it. Putrefaction cannot give birth to\r\na new body: the seed must pre-exist, and it is developed during\r\nputrefaction by the power of the stars. The generation of animals is\r\nproduced by the concourse of the infinite number of seeds which detach\r\nthemselves from all parts of the body. Thus the seed of the nose\r\nreproduces a nose, that of the eye the eye, and so on.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the elements themselves, Paracelsus admits occasionally\r\ntheir influence on the functions of the body, and the theory of\r\ndiseases; but he deduces the faculties which they possess from the\r\n_stars_. It was he that first shook the doctrine of the four elements,\r\noriginally contrived by Empedocles. Alchymy had introduced another set\r\nof elements, and the alchymists maintained that salt, sulphur, and\r\nmercury, were the true elements of things. Paracelsus endeavoured to\r\nreconcile these chemical elements with his cabalistic ideas, and to\r\nshow more clearly their utility in the theory of medicine. He invented\r\na _sideric salt_, which can only be perceived by the exquisite senses\r\nof a theosophist, elevated by the abnegation of all gross sensuality\r\nto a level with pure and spiritual demons. This _salt_ is the cause of\r\nthe consistence of bodies, and it is it which gives them the faculty of\r\nbeing reproduced from their ashes.\r\n\r\nParacelsus imagined also a _sideric sulphur_, which being vivified\r\nby the influence of the stars, gives bodies the property of growing,\r\nand of being combustible. He admits also a _sideric mercury_, the\r\nfoundation of fluidity and volatilization. The concourse of these three\r\nsubstances forms the body. In different parts of his works, Paracelsus\r\nsays, that the _elements_ are composed of these three principles.\r\nIn plants he calls the salt _balsam_, the sulphur _resin_ and the\r\nmercury _gotaronium_. In other passages he opposes the assertion of\r\nthe Galenists, that _fire_ is _dry_ and _hot_, _air cold_ and _moist_,\r\n_earth dry_ and _cold_, _water moist_ and _cold_. Each of these\r\nelements, he says, is capable of admitting all qualities, so that in\r\nreality there exists a _dry water_, a _cold fire_, &c.\r\n\r\nI must not omit another remarkable physiological doctrine of\r\nParacelsus, namely, that there exists in the stomach a demon called\r\n_Archæus_, who presides over the chemical operations which take place\r\nin it, separating the poisonous from the nutritive part of food, and\r\nfurnishing the alimentary substances with the tincture, in consequence\r\nof which they become capable of being assimilated. This _ruler of the\r\nstomach_, who changes bread into blood, is the type of the physician,\r\nwho ought to keep up a good understanding with him, and lend him his\r\nassistance. To produce a change in the humours ought never to be the\r\nobject of the true physician, he should endeavour to concentrate all\r\nhis operations on the stomach and the ruler who reigns in it. This\r\nArchæus to whom the name of _Nature_ may also be given, produces all\r\nthe changes by his own power. It is he alone who cures diseases. He has\r\na _head_ and _hands_, and is nothing else than the _spirit of life_,\r\nthe _sideric body_ of man, and no other spirit besides exists in the\r\nbody. Each part of the body has also a peculiar stomach in which the\r\nsecretions are elaborated.\r\n\r\nThere are, he informs us, five different causes of diseases. The first\r\nis the _ens astrorum_. The constellations do not immediately induce\r\ndiseases, but they alter and infect the air. This is what, properly\r\nspeaking constitutes the _entity of the stars_. Some constellations\r\n_sulphurize_ the atmosphere, others communicate to it _arsenical_,\r\n_saline_, or _mercurial_ qualities. The arsenical astral entities\r\ninjure the blood, the mercurial the head, the saline the bones and\r\nthe vessels. Orpiment occasions tumours and dropsies, and the _bitter\r\nstars_ induce fever.\r\n\r\nThe second morbific cause is the _ens veneni_, which proceeds from\r\nalimentary substances: when the archeus is languid putrefaction\r\nensues, either _localiter_ or _emuncturaliter_. This last takes place\r\nwhen those evacuations, which ought to be expelled by the nose, the\r\nintestines, or the bladder, are retained in the body. Dissolved mercury\r\nescapes through the pores of the skin, white sulphur by the nose,\r\narsenic by the ears, sulphur diluted with water by the eyes, salt in\r\nsolution by the urine, and sulphur deliquesced by the intestines.\r\n\r\nThe third morbific cause of disease is the _ens naturale_; but\r\nParacelsus subjects to the ens astrorum the principles which the\r\nschools are in the habit of arranging among the number of natural\r\ncauses. The _ens spirituale_ forms the fourth species and the _ens\r\ndeale_ or _Christian entity_ the fifth. This last class comprehends all\r\nthe immediate effects of divine predestination.\r\n\r\nIt would lead us too far if I were to point out the strange methods\r\nwhich he takes to discover the cause of diseases. But his doctrine\r\nconcerning _tartar_ is too important, and does our fanatic too much\r\ncredit to be omitted. It is without doubt the most useful of all the\r\ninnovations which he introduced. _Tartar_ according to him, is the\r\nprinciple of all the maladies proceeding from the thickening of the\r\nhumours, the rigidity of the solids, or the accumulation of earthy\r\nmatter. Paracelsus thought the term _stone_ not suitable to indicate\r\nthat matter, because it applies only to one species of it. Frequently\r\nthe principle proceeds from mucilage, and mucilage is tartar. He calls\r\nthis principle _tartar_ (_tartarus_) because it burns like hellfire,\r\nand occasions the most dreadful diseases. As _tartar_ (_bitartrate of\r\npotash_) is deposited at the bottom of the wine-cask, in the same way\r\n_tartar_ in the living body is deposited on the surface of the teeth.\r\nIt is deposited on the internal parts of the body when the archæus acts\r\nwith too great impetuosity and in an irregular manner, and when it\r\nseparates the nutritive principle with too much impetuosity. Then the\r\nsaline spirit unites itself to it and coagulates the earthy principle,\r\nwhich is always present, but often in the state of _materia prima_\r\nwithout being coagulated.\r\n\r\nIn this manner tartar, in the state of _materia prima_, may be\r\ntransmitted from father to son. But it is not hereditary and\r\ntransmittable when it has already assumed the form of gout, of renal\r\ncalculus, or of obstruction. The saline spirit which gives it its form,\r\nand causes its coagulation, is seldom pure and free from mixture;\r\nusually it contains alum, vitriol, or common salt; and this mixture\r\ncontributes also to modify the tartarous diseases. The tartar may be\r\nlikewise distinguished according as it comes from the blood itself,\r\nor from foreign matters accumulated in the humours. The great number\r\nof calculi which have been found in every part of the body, and the\r\nobstructions, confirm the generality of this morbific cause, to which\r\nare due most of the diseases of the liver. When the tartarous matter\r\nis increased by certain articles of food, renal calculi are engendered,\r\na calculous paroxysm is induced, and violent pain is occasioned. It\r\nacts as an emetic, and may even give occasion to death, when the saline\r\nspirit becomes corrosive; and when the tartar coagulated by it becomes\r\ntoo irritating.\r\n\r\nTartar, then, is always an excrementitious substance, which in many\r\ncases results from the too great activity of the digestive forces. It\r\nmay make its appearance in all parts of the body, from the irregularity\r\nand the activity, too energetic or too indolent, of the archeus;\r\nand then it occasions particular accidents relative to each of the\r\nfunctions. Paracelsus enumerates a great number of diseases of the\r\norgans, which may be explained by that one cause; and affirms, that the\r\nprofession of medicine would be infinitely more useful, if medical men\r\nwould endeavour to discover the tartar before they tried to explain the\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nParacelsus points out, also, the means by which we can distinguish\r\nthe presence of tartar in urine. For this it is necessary, not merely\r\nto inspect the urine, but to subject it to a chemical analysis. He\r\ndeclaims violently against the ordinary ouroscopy. He divides urine\r\ninto internal and external; the internal comes from the blood, and the\r\nexternal announces the nature of the food and drink which has been\r\nemployed. To the sediment of urine he gives the new name of _alcola_,\r\nand admits three species of it, namely, _hypostasis_, _divulsio_, and\r\n_sedimen_. The first is connected with the stomach, the second with the\r\nliver, and the third with the kidneys; and tartar predominates in all\r\nthe three.\r\n\r\nThe Cabala constantly directs Paracelsus in his therapeutics and\r\nmateria medica. As all terrestrial things have their image in the\r\nregion of the stars, and as diseases depend also on the influence of\r\nthe stars, we have nothing more to do, in order to obtain a certain\r\ncure for these diseases, than to discover, by means of the Cabala,\r\nthe harmony of the constellations. _Gold_ is a specific against all\r\ndiseases of the _heart_, because, in the mystic scale, it is in\r\nharmony with that viscus. The _liquor of the moon_ and crystal cure\r\nthe diseases of the _brain_. The liquor _alkahest_ and _cheiri_ are\r\nefficacious against those of the _liver_. When we employ vegetable\r\nsubstances, we must consider their harmony with the constellations,\r\nand their magical harmony with the parts of the body and the diseases,\r\neach star drawing, by a sort of magical virtue, the plant for which it\r\nhas an affinity, and imparting to it its activity. So that plants are\r\na kind of sublunary stars. To discover the virtues of plants, we must\r\nstudy their anatomy and cheiromancy; for the leaves are their hands,\r\nand the lines observable on them enable us to appreciate the virtues\r\nwhich they possess. Thus the anatomy of the _chelidonium_ shows us that\r\nit is a remedy for jaundice. These are the celebrated _signatures_ by\r\nmeans of which we deduce the virtues of vegetables, and the medicines\r\nof analogy which they present in relation to their form. Medicines,\r\nlike women, are known by the forms which they affect. He who calls\r\nin question this principle, accuses the Divinity of falsehood, the\r\ninfinite wisdom of whom has contrived these external characters to\r\nbring the study of them more upon a level with the weakness of the\r\nhuman understanding. On the corolla of the euphrasia there is a black\r\ndot; from this we may conclude that it furnishes an excellent remedy\r\nagainst all diseases of the eye. The lizard has the colour of malignant\r\nulcers, and of the carbuncle; this points out the efficacy which that\r\nanimal possesses as a remedy.\r\n\r\nThese signatures were exceedingly convenient for the fanatics, since\r\nthey saved them the trouble of studying the medical virtues of plants,\r\nbut enabled them to decide the subject _à priori_. Paracelsus acted\r\nvery considerately, when he ascribed these virtues principally to the\r\nstars, and affirmed that the observation of favourable constellations\r\nis an indispensable condition in the employment of these medicines.\r\n“The remedies are subjected to the will of the stars, and directed by\r\nthem; you ought therefore to wait till heaven is favourable, before\r\nordering a medicine.”\r\n\r\nParacelsus considered all the effects of plants as specifics, and the\r\nuse of them as secrets. The same notions explain the eulogy which he\r\nbestowed on the _elixir of long life_, and upon all the means which\r\nhe employed to prolong the term of existence. He believed that these\r\nmethods, which contained the _materia prima_, served to repair the\r\nconstant waste of that matter in the human body. He was acquainted,\r\nhe says, with four of these arcana, to which he applied the mystic\r\nterms, _mercury of life_, _philosopher’s stone_, &c. The _polygonum\r\npersicaria_ was an infallible specific against all the effects of\r\nmagic. The method of using it is, to apply it to the suffering part,\r\nand then to bury it in the earth. It draws out the malignant spirits\r\nlike a magnet, and it is buried to prevent these malignant spirits from\r\nmaking their escape.\r\n\r\nThe reformation of Paracelsus had the great advantage of representing\r\n_chemistry_ as an indispensable art in the preparation of medicines.\r\nThe disgusting decoctions and useless syrups gave place to _tinctures_,\r\n_essences_, and _extracts_. Paracelsus says, expressly, that the true\r\nuse of chemistry is to prepare medicines, and not to make gold. He\r\ntakes that opportunity of declaiming against cooks and innkeepers, who\r\ndrown medicines in soup, and thus destroy all their properties. He\r\nblames medical men for prescribing simples, or mixtures of simples, and\r\naffirms that the object should always be to extract the quintessence\r\nof each substance; and he describes at length the method of extracting\r\nthis quintessence. But he was very little scrupulous about the\r\nsubstances from which this quintessence was to be extracted. The\r\nheart of a hare, the bones of a hare, the bone of the heart of a stag,\r\nmother-of-pearl, coral, and various other bodies may, he says, be used\r\nindiscriminately to furnish a quintessence capable of curing some of\r\nthe most grievous diseases.\r\n\r\nParacelsus combats with peculiar energy the method of cure employed\r\nby the disciples of Galen, directed solely against the predominating\r\nhumours, and the elementary qualities. He blames them for attempting\r\nto correct the action of their medicines, by the addition of useless\r\ningredients. Fire and chemistry, he affirmed, are the sole correctives.\r\nIt was Paracelsus that first introduced _tin_ as a remedy for worms,\r\nthough his mode of employing it was not good.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular in pointing out the philosophical and\r\nmedical opinions of Paracelsus, because they were productive of such\r\nimportant consequences, by setting medical men free from the slavish\r\ndeference which they had been accustomed to pay to the dogmas of Galen\r\nand Avicenna. But it was the high rank to which he raised chemistry,\r\nby making a knowledge of it indispensable to all medical men; and by\r\ninsisting that the great importance of chemistry did not consist in the\r\nformation of gold, but in the preparation of medicines, that rendered\r\nthe era of Paracelsus so important in the history of chemistry; for\r\nafter his time the art of chemistry was cultivated by medical men in\r\ngeneral--it became a necessary part of their education, and began to\r\nbe taught in colleges and medical schools. The object of chemistry\r\ncame to be, not to discover the philosopher’s stone, but to prepare\r\nmedicines; and a great number of new medicines, both from the mineral\r\nand vegetable kingdom--some of more, some of less, consequence, soon\r\nissued from the laboratories of the chemical physicians.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that many chemical preparations were either\r\nfirst introduced into medicine by Paracelsus, or at least were first\r\nopenly prescribed by him: though from the nature of his writings, and\r\nthe secrecy in which he endeavoured to keep his most valuable remedies,\r\nit is not easy to point out what these remedies were. Mercury is said\r\nto have been employed in medicine by Basil Valentine; but it was\r\nParacelsus who first used it openly as a cure for the venereal disease,\r\nand who drew general attention to it by his encomiums on its medical\r\nvirtues, and by the eclat of the cures which he performed by means of\r\nit, after all the Galenical prescriptions of the schools had been tried\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nHe ascertained that alum contains, united to an acid, not a metallic\r\noxide, but an earth. He mentions metallic arsenic; but there is some\r\nreason for believing that this metal was known to Geber and the\r\nArabian physicians. Zinc is mentioned by him, and likewise bismuth,\r\nas substances not truly metallic, but approaching to metals in their\r\nproperties: for malleability and ductility were considered by him as\r\nessential to the metals.[159] I cannot be sure of any other chemical\r\nfact which appears in Paracelsus, and which was not known before his\r\ntime. The use of sal ammoniac in subliming several metallic calces,\r\nwas familiar to him, but it had long ago been explained by Geber. It\r\nis clear also that Geber was acquainted with aqua regia, and that he\r\nemployed it to dissolve gold. Paracelsus’s reputation as a chemist,\r\ntherefore, depends not upon any discoveries which he actually made,\r\nbut upon the great importance which he attached to the knowledge of\r\nit, and to his making an acquaintance with chemistry an indispensable\r\nrequisite of a medical education.\r\n\r\n[159] Philosophiæ, tract. iv. De Mineralibus. Opera Paracelsi, ii.\r\n282. “Quando ergo hoc modo metalla fiunt et producuntur, dum scilicet\r\nverus metallicus fluxus et ductilitas aufertur et in septem metalla\r\ndistribuitur; residentia quædam manet in Ares, instar fœtûm trium\r\nprimorum. Ex hac nescitur zinetum, quod et metallum est et non est.\r\nSic et bisemutum et huic similia alia partim fluida, partim ductilia\r\nsunt--Zinetum maxima ex parte spuria soboles est ex cupro et bisemutum\r\nde stanno. Ex hisce duobus omnium plurimæ fæces et remanentiæ in Ares\r\nfiunt.”\r\n\r\nParacelsus, as the founder of a new system of medicine, the object\r\nof which was to draw chemistry out of that state of obscurity and\r\ndegradation into which it had been plunged, and to give it the charge\r\nof the preparation of medicine, and presiding over the whole healing\r\nart, deserved a particular notice; and I have even endeavoured, at\r\nsome length, to lay his system of opinions, absurd as it is, before\r\nthe reader. But the same attention is not due to the herd of followers\r\nwho adopted his absurdities, and even carried them, if possible,\r\nstill further than their master: at the same time there are one or\r\ntwo particulars connected with the Paracelsian sect which it would be\r\nimproper to omit.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated of his followers was Leonhard\r\nThurneysser-zum-Thurn, who was born in 1530, at Basle, where his father\r\nwas a goldsmith. His life, like that of his master, was checkered with\r\nvery extraordinary vicissitudes. In 1560 he was sent to Scotland to\r\nexamine the lead-mines in that country. In 1558 he commenced miner and\r\nsulphur extractor at Tarenz on the Inn, and was so successful, that he\r\nacquired a great reputation. He had turned his attention to medicine\r\non the Paracelsian plan, and in 1568 made himself distinguished by\r\nseveral important cures which he performed. In 1570 he published his\r\nQuinta Essentia, with wooden cuts, in Munster; from thence he went to\r\nFrankfort on the Oder, and published his Piso, a work which treats of\r\n_waters_, _rivers_, and _springs_. John George, Elector of Brandenburg,\r\nwas at that time in Frankfort, and was informed that the treatise\r\nof Thurneysser pointed out the existence of a great deal of riches\r\nin the March of Brandenburg, till that time unknown. His courtiers,\r\nwho were anxious to establish mines in their possessions, united in\r\nrecommending the author. He was consulted about a disease under which\r\nthe wife of the elector was labouring, and having performed a cure, he\r\nwas immediately named physician to this prince.\r\n\r\nHe turned this situation to the best account. He sold Spanish white,\r\nand other cosmetics, to the ladies of the court; and instead of the\r\ndisgusting decoctions of the Galenists, he administered the remedies of\r\nParacelsus under the pompous titles of _tincture of gold_, _magistery\r\nof the sun_, _potable gold_, &c. By these methods he succeeded in\r\namassing a prodigious fortune, but was not fortunate enough to be able\r\nto keep it. Gaspard Hoffmann, professor at Frankfort, a well-informed\r\nand enlightened man, published a treatise, the object of which was\r\nto expose the extravagant pretensions and ridiculous ignorance of\r\nThurneysser. This book drew the attention of the courtiers, and opened\r\nthe eyes of the elector. Thurneysser lost much of his reputation; and\r\nthe methods by which he attempted to bolster himself up, served only\r\nto sink him still lower in the estimation of men of sense. Among other\r\nthings, he gave out that he was the possessor of a devil, which he\r\ncarried about with him in a bottle. This pretended devil was nothing\r\nelse than a scorpion, preserved in a phial of oil. The trick was\r\ndiscovered, and the usual consequences followed. He lost a process with\r\nhis wife, from whom he was separated; this deprived him of the greatest\r\npart of his fortune. In 1584 he fled to Italy, where he occupied\r\nhimself with the transmutation of metals, and he died at Cologne in\r\n1595.\r\n\r\nThurneysser extols Paracelsus as the only true physician that ever\r\nexisted. His Quintessence is written in verse. In the first book\r\n_The Secret_ is the speaker. He is represented with a padlock in his\r\nmouth, a key in his hand, and seated on a coffer in a chamber, the\r\nwindows of which are shut. This personage teaches that all things\r\nare composed of salt, sulphur, and mercury, or of earth, air, and\r\nwater; and consequently that _fire_ is excluded from the number of the\r\nelements. We must search for the secret in the _Bible_, and then in\r\nthe _stars_ and the _spirits_. In the second book, _Alchymy_ is the\r\nspeaker. She points out the mode of performing the processes; and says\r\nthat to endeavour to fix volatile substances, is the same thing as to\r\nendeavour to trace white letters on a wall with a piece of charcoal.\r\nShe prohibits all long processes, because God created the world in six\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nHis method of judging of the diseases from the urine of the patient\r\ndeserves to be mentioned. He distilled the urine, and fixed to the\r\nreceiver a tube furnished with a scale, the degrees of which consisted\r\nof all the parts of the body. The phenomena which he observed during\r\nthe distillation of the urine, enabled him to draw inferences\r\nrespecting the state of all these different organs.\r\n\r\nI pass over Bodenstein, Taxites, and Dorn, who distinguished themselves\r\nas partisans of Paracelsus. Dorn derived the whole of chemistry from\r\nthe first chapter of Genesis, the words of which he explained in an\r\nalchymistical sense. These words in particular, “And God made the\r\nfirmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament\r\nfrom the waters which were above the firmament,” appeared to him to\r\nbe an account of the _great work_. Severinus, physician to the King\r\nof Denmark, and canon of Roskild, was also a celebrated partisan of\r\nParacelsus; but his writings do not show either that knowledge or\r\nstretch of thought which would enable us to account for the reputation\r\nwhich he acquired and enjoyed.\r\n\r\nThere were very few partisans of Paracelsus out of Germany. The most\r\ncelebrated of his followers among the French, was Joseph du Chesne,\r\nbetter known by the name of Quercitanus, who was physician to Henry\r\nIV. He was a native of Gascony, and drew many enemies upon himself by\r\nhis arrogant and overbearing conduct. He pretended to be acquainted\r\nwith the method of making gold. He was a thorough-going Paracelsian.\r\nHe affirmed that diseases, like plants, spring from seeds. The word\r\nalchymy, according to him, is composed of the two Greek words ἁλς\r\n(salt) and χημεια, because the _great secret_ is concealed in salt. All\r\nbodies are composed of three principles, as God is of three substances.\r\nThese principles are contained in saltpetre, the salts of sulphur solid\r\nand volatile, and the volatile mercurial salt. He who possesses _sal\r\ngeneralis_ may easily produce philosophical gold, and draw potable\r\ngold from the three kingdoms of nature. To prove the possibility of\r\nthis transmutation, he cites an experiment very often repeated after\r\nhim, and which some theologians have even employed as analogous to the\r\nresurrection of the dead; namely, the faculty which plants have of\r\nbeing produced from their ashes. His materia medica is founded on the\r\n_signatures_ of plants, which he carries so far as to assert that male\r\nplants are more suitable to men, and female plants to women. Sulphuric\r\nacid, he says, has a magnetic virtue, in consequence of which it is\r\ncapable of curing the epilepsy. He recommends the _magisterium cranii\r\nhumani_ as an excellent medicine, and boasts much of the virtues of\r\nantimony.\r\n\r\nDu Chesne was opposed by Riolanus, who attacked chemical remedies with\r\nmuch bitterness. The medical faculty of Paris took up the cause of the\r\nGalenists with much zeal, and prohibited their fellows and licentiates\r\nfrom using any chemical medicines whatever. He had to sustain a\r\ndispute with Aubert relative to the origin and the transmutation of\r\nmetals. Fenot came to the assistance of Aubert, and affirmed that gold\r\npossesses no medical properties whatever, that _crabs’ eyes_ are of\r\nno use when administered in intermittents, and that the laudanum of\r\nParacelsus (being an opiate) is in reality hurtful instead of being\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\nThe decree of the medical faculty of Paris which placed antimony among\r\nthe poisons, and which occasioned that of the Parliament of Paris, was\r\ncomposed by Simon Pietre, the elder, a man of great erudition and the\r\nmost unimpeachable probity. Had it been literally obeyed it would have\r\noccasioned very violent proceedings; because chemical remedies, as they\r\nact more promptly and with greater energy, were getting daily into\r\nmore general use. In 1603 the celebrated Theodore Turquet de Mayenne\r\nwas prosecuted, because, in spite of the prohibition, he had sold\r\nantimonial preparations. The decree of the faculty against him exhibits\r\na remarkable proof of the bigotry and intolerance of the times.[160]\r\nHowever Turquet does not seem to have been molested notwithstanding\r\nthis decree. He ceased indeed to be professor of chemistry, but\r\ncontinued to practise medicine as formerly; and two members of the\r\nfaculty, Seguin and Akakia, even wrote an apology for him. At last he\r\nwent to England, whither he had been invited, to accept an honourable\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\n[160] It was as follows: “Collegium medicorum in Academia Parisiensi\r\nlegitime congregatum, audita renunciatione sensorum, quibus demandata\r\nerat provincia examinandi apologiam sub nomine Mayerni Turqueti editam,\r\nipsam unanimi consensu damnat, tanquam famosum libellum, mendacibus\r\nconviciis et impudentibus calumniis refertum, quæ nonnisi ab homine\r\nimperito, impudenti, temulento et furioso profiteri potuerunt. Ipsum\r\nTurquetum indignum judicat, qui usquam medicinam faciat, propter\r\ntemeritatem, impudentiam et veræ medicinæ ignorantiam. Omnes vero\r\nmedicos, qui ubique gentium et locorum medicinam exercent, hortatur\r\nut ipsum Turquetum similiaque hominum et opinionum portenta, a se\r\nsuisque finibus arceant et in Hippocratis ac Galeni doctrina constantes\r\npermaneant: et prohibuit ne quis ex hoc medicorum Parisiensium ordine\r\ncum Turqueto eique similibus medica consilia ineat. Qui secus fecerit,\r\nscholæ ornamentis et academiæ privilegiis privabitur, et de regentium\r\nnumero expungetur.--Datum Lutetiæ in scholis superioribus, die 5\r\nDecembris, anno salutis, 1603.”\r\n\r\nThe mystical doctrines of Paracelsus are supposed to have given\r\norigin to the sect of Rosecrucians, concerning which so much has been\r\nwritten and so little certain is known. It is not at all unlikely\r\nthat the greatest part, if not the whole that has been stated about\r\nthe antiquity, and extent, and importance of this sect, is mere\r\nfiction, and that the origin of the whole was nothing else than a\r\nludicrous performance of Valentine Andreæ, an ecclesiastic of Calwe,\r\nin the country of Wirtemburg, a man of much learning, genius, and\r\nphilanthropy. From his life, written by himself, and preserved in\r\nthe library of Wolfenbuttel, we learn that in the year 1603 he drew\r\nup the celebrated Noce Chimique of Christian Rosenkreuz, in order to\r\ncounteract the alchymistical and the theosophistical dogmas so common\r\nat that period. He was unable to restrain his risible faculties when\r\nhe saw this _ludibrium juvenilis ingenii_ adopted as a true history,\r\nwhile he meant it merely as a satire. It is believed that the Fama\r\nFraternitatis is a production of this ecclesiastic, and that he\r\npublished it in order to correct the chemists and enthusiasts of the\r\ntime. He himself was called Andreæ, Knight of the Rose-cross (_rosæ\r\ncrucis_) because he had engraven on his seal a cross with four roses.\r\n\r\nIt is true that Andreæ instituted, in 1620, a _fraternitas christiana_,\r\nbut with quite other views than those which are supposed to have\r\nactuated the Rosecrucians. His object was to correct the religious\r\nopinions of the times, and to separate Christian theology from\r\nscholastic controversies, with which it had been unhappily intermixed.\r\nHe himself, in different parts of his writings, distinguishes carefully\r\nbetween the Rosecrucians and his own society, and amuses himself with\r\nthe credulity of the German theosophists, who adopted so readily his\r\nfiction for a series of truths. It would appear, therefore, that this\r\nsecret order of Rosecrucians, notwithstanding the brilliant origin\r\nassigned to it, really owes its birth to the pleasantry of a clergyman\r\nof Wirtemburg, who endeavoured by that means to set bounds to the\r\nchimeras of theosophy, but who unfortunately only increased still more\r\nthe adherents of this absurd science.\r\n\r\nA crowd of enthusiasts found it too advantageous to propagate the\r\nprinciples of the _rosa crux_ not to endeavour to unite them into\r\na sect. Valentine Weigel, a fanatical preacher at Tschoppau, near\r\nChemnitz, left at his death a prodigious number of followers, who\r\nwere already Rosecrucians, without bearing the name. Egidius Gutmann,\r\nof Suabia, was equally a Rosecrucian, without bearing the name; he\r\ncondemned all pagan medicines, and affirmed that he possessed the\r\nuniversal remedy which ennobles man, cures all diseases, and gives man\r\nthe power of fabricating gold. “To fly in the air, to transmute metals,\r\nand to know all the sciences,” says he, “nothing more is requisite than\r\nfaith.”\r\n\r\nOswald Crollius, of Hesse, must also take his station in this\r\nhonourable fraternity of enthusiasts. He was physician to the Prince\r\nof Anhalt, and afterwards a counsellor of the Emperor Rodolphus II.\r\nThe introduction to his Basilica Chymica, contains a short but exact\r\nepitome of the opinions of Paracelsus. It is not worth while to give\r\nthe reader a notion of his own opinions, which are quite as absurd\r\nand unintelligible as those of Paracelsus and his followers. As a\r\npreparer of chemical medicines he deserves more credit; _antimonium\r\ndiaphoreticum_ was a favourite preparation of his, and so was sulphate\r\nof potash, which was known at the time by the name of _specificum\r\npurgans Paracelsi_: he knew chloride of silver well, and first gave it\r\nthe name of _luna cornea_, or _horn silver_: fulminating gold was known\r\nto him, and called by him _aurum volatile_.\r\n\r\nThis is the place to mention Andrew Libavius, of Halle, in Saxony,\r\nwhere he was a physician, and a professor in the gymnasium of\r\nCoburg, who was one of the most successful opponents of the school\r\nof Paracelsus, and whose writings do him much credit. As a chemist,\r\nhe deserves perhaps to occupy a higher rank than any of his\r\ncontemporaries: he was, it is true, a believer in the possibility of\r\ntransmuting metals, and boasted of the wonderful powers of _aurum\r\npotabile_; but he always distinguishes between rational alchymy and\r\nthe _mental_ alchymy of Paracelsus. He separated, with great care,\r\n_chemistry_ from the reveries of the theosophists, and stands at\r\nthe head of those who opposed most successfully the progress of\r\nsuperstition and fanaticism, which was making such an overwhelming\r\nprogress in his time. His writings are very numerous and various, and\r\nwere collected and published at Frankfort, in 1615, in three folio\r\nvolumes, under the title of “Opera omnia Medico-chymica.” Libavius\r\nhimself died in 1616. It would occupy more space than we have room\r\nfor, to attempt an abstract of his very multifarious works. A few\r\nobservations will be sufficient: he wrote no fewer than five different\r\ntracts to expose the quackery of George Amwald, who had boasted that\r\nhe was in possession of a panacea, by means of which he was enabled\r\nto perform the most wonderful cures, and which he was in the habit of\r\nselling to his patients at an enormous price; Libavius showed that\r\nthis boasted panacea was nothing else than _cinnabar_, which neither\r\npossessed the virtues ascribed to it by Amwald, nor deserved to be\r\npurchased at so high a price. He entered also into a controversy\r\nwith Crollius, and exposed his fanatical and absurd opinions. He\r\nengaged likewise in a dispute with Henning Scheunemann, a physician in\r\nBamberg, who was a Rosecrucian, and, like the rest of his brethren,\r\nprofoundly ignorant not merely of all science, but even of philology.\r\nThe expressions of Scheunemann are so obscure, that we learn more of\r\nhis opinions from Libavius than from his own writings. He divides the\r\ninternal nature of man into seven different degrees, from the seven\r\nchanges it undergoes: these are, combustion, sublimation, dissolution,\r\nputrefaction, distillation, coagulation, and tincture. He gives us\r\nlikewise an account of ten modifications which the three elements\r\nundergo; but as they are quite unintelligible, it is not worth while to\r\nstate them. Libavius had the patience to analyze and expose all these\r\ngallimatias.\r\n\r\nLibavius’s system of chemistry, entitled “Alchymia è dispersis passim\r\noptimorum auctorum, veterum et recentiorum exemplis potissimum, tum\r\netiam preceptis quibusdam operose collecta, adhibitisque ratione\r\net experientia quanta potuit esse methodo accurate explicata et in\r\nintegrum corpus redacta. Accesserunt tractati nonnulli physici chymici\r\nitem methodistici.” Frankfort, 1595, folio, 1597, 4to.--is really an\r\nexcellent book, considering the period in which it was written, and\r\ndeserves the attention of every person who is interested in the history\r\nof chemistry. I shall notice some of the most remarkable chemical facts\r\nwhich occur in Libavius, and which I have not observed in any preceding\r\nwriter; who the actual discoverer of these facts really was, it is\r\nimpossible to say, in consequence of the secrecy which at that time was\r\naffected, and the obscure terms in which chemical facts are in general\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nHe was aware that the fumes of sulphur have the property of blackening\r\nwhite lead. He was in the habit of purifying cinnabar by means of\r\narsenic and oxide of lead. He knew the method of giving glass a red\r\ncolour by means of gold or its oxide, and was aware of the method\r\nof making artificial gems, such as ruby, topaz, hyacinth, garnet,\r\nbalass, by tinging glass by means of metallic oxides. He points out\r\nfluor spar as an excellent flux for various metals and their oxides.\r\nHe knew that when metals were fused along with alkaline bodies, a\r\ncertain portion of them was converted into slags, and this portion\r\nhe endeavoured to recover by the addition of iron filings. He was\r\naware of the mode of acidifying sulphur by means of nitric acid. He\r\nknew that camphor is soluble in nitric acid, and forms with it a kind\r\nof oil. Of the perchloride of tin he was undoubtedly the discoverer,\r\nas it has continued ever since his time to pass by his name; namely,\r\n_fuming liquor of Libavius_. He was aware, that alcohol or spirits\r\ncould be obtained by distilling the fermented juice of a great variety\r\nof sweet fruits. He procured sulphuric acid by the distillation of alum\r\nand sulphate of iron, as Geber had done long before his time; but he\r\ndetermined the nature of the acid with more care than had been done,\r\nand showed, that it was the same as that obtained by the combustion of\r\nsulphur along with saltpetre. To him, therefore, in some measure, are\r\nwe indebted for the process of preparing sulphuric acid which is at\r\npresent practised by manufacturers.\r\n\r\nLibavius found a successor in Angelus Sala, of Vicenza, physician to\r\nthe Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, worthy of his enlightened views and\r\nindefatigable exertions to oppose the torrent of fanaticism which\r\nthreatened to overwhelm all Europe. Sala was still more addicted to\r\nchemical remedies than Libavius himself; but he had abjured a multitude\r\nof prejudices which had distinguished the school of Paracelsus. He\r\ndiscarded _aurum potabile_, and considered fulminating gold as the\r\nonly remedy of that metal that deserved to be prescribed by medical\r\nmen. He treated the notion of the existence of a universal remedy with\r\ncontempt. He described sulphuret of gold and glass of antimony with a\r\ngood deal of precision. He recommended sulphuric acid as an excellent\r\nremedy, and showed that it might be formed indifferently from sulphur,\r\nor by distilling blue vitriol or green vitriol. He affirmed, that the\r\nessential salts obtained from plants had not the same virtues as the\r\nplants from which they are obtained. He showed that sal ammoniac is\r\na compound of muriatic acid and ammonia. To him, therefore, we are\r\nindebted for the first accurate mention of ammonia. It could not but\r\nhave been noticed before by chemists, as it is procured with so much\r\nease by the distillation of animal substances; but Sala is the first\r\nperson who seems to have examined it with attention, and to have\r\nrecognised its peculiar properties, and the readiness with which it\r\nsaturates the different acids. He showed that iron has the property\r\nof precipitating copper from acid solutions: he pointed out also\r\nvarious precipitations of metals by other metals. He seems to have\r\nbeen acquainted with calomel, and to have been aware of at least some\r\nof its medical properties. He says, that fulminating gold loses its\r\nfulminating property when mixed with its own weight of sulphur, and\r\nthe sulphur is burnt off it. Many other curious chemical facts occur\r\nin his writings, which it would be too tedious to particularize here.\r\nHis works were collected and published in a quarto volume at Frankfort,\r\nin 1647, under the title of “Opera Medico-chymica, quæ extant omnia.”\r\nThere was another edition in the same place in 1682, and an edition was\r\npublished at Rome in 1650.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nOF VAN HELMONT AND THE IATRO-CHEMISTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nParacelsus first raised the dignity of chemistry, by pointing out the\r\nnecessity of it for medical men, and by showing the superiority of\r\nchemical medicines over the disgusting decoctions of the Galenists.\r\nLibavius and Angelus Sala had carefully separated chemistry from the\r\nfanatical opinions of the followers of Paracelsus and the Rosecrucians.\r\nBut matters were not doomed to remain in this state. Chemistry\r\nunderwent a new revolution at this period, which shook the Spagirical\r\nsystem to its foundation; substituted other principles, and gave to\r\nmedicine an aspect entirely new. This revolution was in a great measure\r\ndue to the labours of Van Helmont.\r\n\r\nJohn Baptist Van Helmont was a gentleman of Brabant, and Lord of\r\nMerode, of Royenboch, of Oorschot, and of Pellines. He was born in\r\nBrussels in 1577, and studied scholastic philosophy in Louvain till\r\nthe age of seventeen. After having finished his _humanity_ (as it was\r\ntermed), he ought, according to the usage of the place, to have taken\r\nhis degree of master of arts; but, having reflected on the futility of\r\nthese ceremonies, he resolved never to solicit any academical honour.\r\nHe next associated himself to the Jesuits, who then delivered courses\r\nof philosophy at Louvain, to the great displeasure of the professors\r\nof that city. One of the most celebrated of the Jesuits, Martin del\r\nRio, even taught him magic. But Van Helmont was disappointed in his\r\nexpectations: instead of that true wisdom which he hoped to acquire,\r\nhe met with nothing but scholastic dialectics, with all its usual\r\nsubtilties. He was no better satisfied with the doctrines of the\r\nStoics, who taught him his own weakness and misery.\r\n\r\nAt last the works of Thomas à Kempis, and John Taulerus fell into\r\nhis hands. These sacred books of mysticism attracted his attention:\r\nhe thought that he perceived that wisdom is the gift of the Supreme\r\nBeing; that it must be obtained by prayer; and that we must renounce\r\nour own will, if we wish to participate in the influence of the divine\r\ngrace. From this moment he imitated Jesus Christ, in his humility. He\r\nabandoned all his property to his sister, renouncing the privileges\r\nof his birth, and laying aside the rank which he had hitherto\r\noccupied in society. It was not long before he reaped the fruit of\r\nthese abnegations. A genius appeared to him in all the important\r\ncircumstances of his life. In the year 1633 his own soul appeared to\r\nhim under the figure of a resplendent crystal.\r\n\r\nThe desire which he had of imitating in every respect the conduct of\r\nChrist, suggested to him the idea of practising medicine as a work of\r\ncharity and benevolence. He began, as was then the custom of the time,\r\nby studying the art of healing in the writings of the ancients. He\r\nread the works of Hippocrates and Galen with avidity; and made himself\r\nso well acquainted with their opinions, that he astonished all the\r\nmedical men by the profundity of his knowledge. But as his taste for\r\nmysticism was insatiable, he soon became disgusted with the writings\r\nof the Greeks; an accident led him to abandon them for ever. Happening\r\nto take up the glove of a young girl afflicted with the _itch_, he\r\ncaught that disagreeable disease. The Galenists whom he consulted,\r\nattributed it to the combustion of the bile, and the saline state of\r\nthe phlegm. They prescribed a course of purgatives which weakened him\r\nconsiderably, without effecting a cure. This circumstance disgusted him\r\nwith the system of the humorists, and led him to form the resolution of\r\nreforming medicine, as Paracelsus had done. The works of this reformer,\r\nwhich he read with attention, awakened in him a spirit of reformation,\r\nbut did not satisfy him; because his knowledge, being much greater\r\nthan that of Paracelsus, he could not avoid despising the disgusting\r\negotism, and the ridiculous ignorance of that fanatic. Though he had\r\nalready refused a canonicate, he took the degree of doctor of medicine,\r\nin 1599, and afterwards travelled through the greatest part of France\r\nand Italy; and he assures us, that during his travels, he performed\r\na great number of cures. On his return, he married a rich Brabantine\r\nlady, by whom he had several children; among others a son, afterwards\r\ncelebrated under the name of Francis Mercurius, who edited his father’s\r\nworks, and who went a good deal further than his father had done, in\r\nall the branches of theosophy. Van Helmont passed the rest of his\r\nlife on his estate at Vilvorde, almost constantly occupied with the\r\nprocesses of his laboratory. He died in the year 1644, on the 13th of\r\nDecember, at six o’clock in the evening, after having nearly reached\r\nthe age of sixty-seven years.\r\n\r\nThe system of Van Helmont has for its basis the opinions of the\r\nspiritualists. He arranged even the influence of evil genii, the\r\nefforts of sorcerers, and the power of magicians among the causes which\r\nproduce diseases. The archeus of Paracelsus constituted one of the\r\ncapital points of his theory; but he ascribed to it a more substantial\r\nnature than Paracelsus had done. This archeus is independent of\r\nthe elements; it has no form; for form constitutes the object of\r\ngeneration, or of production. These ideas are obviously borrowed\r\nfrom the ancients. The _form_ of Aristotle is not the μορφη, but the\r\nενεργεια (_the power of acting_) which matter does not possess.\r\n\r\nThe archeus draws all the corpuscles of matter to the aid of\r\n_fermentation_. There are, properly speaking, only two causes of\r\nthings; the cause _ex qua_, and the cause _per quam_. The first of\r\nthese causes is _water_. Van Helmont considered water as the true\r\nprinciple of every thing which exists; and he brought forward very\r\nspecious arguments in favour of his opinion, drawn both from the\r\nanimal and vegetable kingdom. The reader will find his arguments on\r\nthe subject, in his treatise entitled “Complexionum atque Mistionum\r\nelementalium Figmentum.”[161] The only one of his experiments that,\r\nin the present state of our knowledge, possesses much plausibility,\r\nis the following: He took a large earthen vessel, and put into it 200\r\nlbs. of earth, previously dried in an oven. This earth he moistened\r\nwith rain-water, and planted in it a willow which weighed five pounds.\r\nAfter an interval of five years, he pulled up his willow and found\r\nthat its weight amounted to 169 pounds, and about three ounces. During\r\nthese five years, the earth in the pot was duly watered with rain\r\nor distilled water. To prevent the earth in which the willow grew\r\nfrom being mixed with new earth blown upon it by the winds, the pot\r\nwas covered with tin plate, pierced with a great number of holes to\r\nadmit the air freely. The leaves which fell every autumn during the\r\nvegetation of the willow in the pot, were not reckoned in the 169 lbs.\r\n3 oz. The earth in the pot being again dried in the oven, was found to\r\nhave lost about two ounces of its original weight. Thus 164 lbs. of\r\nwood, bark, roots, &c., were produced from water alone.[162] This,\r\nand several other experiments which it is needless to state, satisfied\r\nhim that all vegetable substances are produced from water alone. He\r\ntakes it for granted that fish live (ultimately at least) on water\r\nalone; but they contain almost all the peculiar animal substances that\r\nexist in the animal kingdom. Hence he concludes that animal substances\r\nare derived also from pure water.[163] His reasoning with respect\r\nto sulphur, glass, stone, metals, &c., all of which he thinks may\r\nultimately be resolved into water, is not so satisfactory.\r\n\r\n[161] J. B. Van Helmont, Opera Omnia, p. 100. The edition which I quote\r\nfrom was printed at Frankfort, in 1682, at the expense of John Justus\r\nErythropilus, in a very thick quarto volume.\r\n\r\n[162] Van Helmont, Opera Omnia, p. 104.\r\n\r\n[163] Ibid., p. 105.\r\n\r\nWater produces elementary earth, or pure quartz; but this elementary\r\nearth does not enter into the composition of organic bodies. Van\r\nHelmont excludes _fire_ from the number of elements, because it is not\r\na substance, nor even the essential form of a substance. The matter of\r\nfire is compound, and differs entirely from the matter of light. Water\r\ngives origin also to the three chemical principles, salt, sulphur, and\r\nmercury, which cannot be considered as elements or active principles. I\r\ndo not see clearly how he gets rid of _air_; for he says, that though\r\nwater may be elevated in the form of vapour, yet that these vapours are\r\nno more air than the dust of marble is water.\r\n\r\nAccording to Van Helmont, a particular disposition of matter, or a\r\nparticular mixture of that matter is not necessary for the formation of\r\na body. The archeus, by its sole power, draws all bodies from water,\r\nwhen the _ferment_ exists. This _ferment_, in its quality of a mean\r\nwhich determines the action of the archeus, is not a formal being; it\r\ncan neither be called a _substance_, nor an _accident_. It pre-exists\r\nin the seed which is developed by it, and which contains in itself\r\na second ferment of the seed, the product of the first. The ferment\r\nexhales an odour, which attracts the generating spirit of the archeus.\r\nThis spirit consists in an _aura vitalis_, and it creates the bodies\r\nof nature in its own image, after its own _idea_. It is the true\r\nfoundation of life, and of all the functions of organized bodies; it\r\ndisappears only at the instant of death to produce a new creation of\r\nthe body, which enters then, for the second time, into fermentation.\r\nThe seed, then, is not indispensable to enable an animal to propagate\r\nits species; it is merely necessary that the archeus should act upon\r\na suitable ferment. Animals produced in this manner are as perfect as\r\nthose which spring from eggs.\r\n\r\nWhen water, as an element, ferments, it develops a vapour, to which Van\r\nHelmont gave the name of _gas_, and which he endeavours to distinguish\r\nfrom _air_. This gas contains the chemical principles of the body from\r\nwhich it escapes in an aerial form by the impulse of the archeus. It\r\nis a substance intermediate between spirit and matter, the principle\r\nof action of life, and of generation of all bodies; for its production\r\nis the first result of the action of the vital spirit on the torpid\r\nferment, and it may be compared to the _chaos_ of the ancients.\r\n\r\nThe term _gas_, now in common use among chemists, and applied by them\r\nto all elastic fluids which differ in their properties from common air,\r\nwas first employed by Van Helmont: and it is evident, from different\r\nparts of his writings, that he was aware that different species of gas\r\nexist. His _gas sylvestre_ was evidently our _carbonic acid gas_, for\r\nhe says, that it is evolved during the fermentation of wine and beer;\r\nthat it is formed when charcoal is burnt in air; and that it exists\r\nin the Grotto del Cane. He was aware that this gas extinguishes a\r\nlighted candle. But he says that the gases from dung, and those formed\r\nin the large intestines, when passed through a candle, catch fire,\r\nand exhibit a variety of colours, like the rainbow.[164] To these\r\ncombustible gases he gave the names of _gas pingue_, _gas siccum_, _gas\r\nfuliginosum_, or _endimicum_.\r\n\r\n[164] De Flatibus, sect. 49. Opera Van Helmont, p. 405.\r\n\r\nSal ammoniac, he says, may be distilled alone, without danger, and so\r\nmay aqua fortis (_aqua chrysulca_), but if they be mixed together so\r\nmuch gas sylvestre is produced, that the vessels employed, however\r\nstrong, will burst asunder, unless an opening be left for the escape\r\nof this gas.[165] In the same way cream of tartar cannot be distilled\r\nin close vessels without breaking them in pieces, an opening must be\r\nleft for the escape of the _gas sylvestre_, which is generated in\r\nsuch abundance.[166] He says, also, that when carbonate of lime is\r\ndissolved in distilled vinegar, or silver in nitric acid, abundance\r\nof gas sylvestre is extricated. From these, and many other passages\r\nwhich might be quoted, it is evident that Van Helmont was aware of the\r\nevolution of gas during the solution of carbonates and metals in acids,\r\nand during the distillation of various animal and vegetable substances,\r\nthat he had anticipated the experiments made so many years after by\r\nDr. Hales, and for which that philosopher got so much credit. But it\r\nwould be going too far to say, as some have done, that Van Helmont\r\nknew accurately the differences which characterize the different gases\r\nwhich he produced, or indeed that he distinguished accurately between\r\nthem. For it is evident, from the passages quoted and from many others\r\nwhich occur in his treatise, De Flatibus, that carbonic acid, protoxide\r\nof azote, and deutoxide of azote, and probably also muriatic acid gas\r\nwere all considered by him as constituting one and the same gas. How,\r\nindeed, could he distinguish between different gases when he was not\r\nacquainted with the method of collecting them, or of determining their\r\nproperties? These observations of Van Helmont, then, though they do him\r\nmuch credit, and show how far his chemical knowledge was superior to\r\nthat of the age in which he lived, take nothing from the merit or the\r\ncredit of those illustrious chemists who, in the latter half of the\r\neighteenth century, devoted themselves to the investigation of this\r\npart of chemistry, at that time attended with much difficulty, but\r\nintimately connected with the subsequent progress which the science has\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n[165] Ibid., p. 408.\r\n\r\n[166] Ibid., p. 409.\r\n\r\nVan Helmont was aware, also, that the bulk of air is diminished when\r\nbodies are burnt in it. He considered respiration to be necessary in\r\nthis way: the air was drawn into the blood by the pulmonary arteries\r\nand veins, and occasioned a fermentation in it requisite for the\r\ncontinuance of life.\r\n\r\nGas, according to Van Helmont, has an affinity with the principle of\r\nthe movement of the stars, to which he gave the name of _blas_. It had,\r\nhe supposed, much influence on all sublunary bodies. He admitted in\r\nthe ferment which gives birth to plants, a substance which, after the\r\nexample of Paracelsus, he called _pessas_, and to the metallic ferment\r\nhe gave the name of _bur_.[167]\r\n\r\n[167] In his Magnum Oportet, sect. 39, p. 151, he gives an account\r\nof the origin of metals in the earth, and in that section there is a\r\ndescription of _bur_, which those who are anxious to understand the\r\nideas of the author on this subject may consult.\r\n\r\nThe archeus of Van Helmont, like that of Paracelsus, has its seat in\r\nthe stomach. It is the same thing as the sentient soul. This notion\r\nof the nature and seat of the archeus was founded on the following\r\nexperiment: He swallowed a quantity of _aconitum_ (_henbane_). In two\r\nhours he experienced the most disagreeable sensation in his stomach.\r\nHis feeling and understanding seemed to be concentrated in that\r\norgan, for he had no longer the free use of his mental faculties.\r\nThis feeling induced him to place the seat of understanding in the\r\nstomach, of volition in the heart, and of memory in the brain. The\r\nfaculty of desire, to which the ancients had assigned the liver as its\r\norgan, he placed in the spleen. What confirmed him still more in the\r\nidea that the stomach is the seat of the soul, is the fact, that life\r\nsometimes continues after the destruction of the brain, but never, he\r\nalleges, after that of the stomach. The sentient soul acts constantly\r\nby means of the _vital spirits_, which are of a resplendent nature,\r\nand the nerves serve merely to moisten these spirits which constitute\r\nthe mediums of sensation. By virtue of the archeus man is much nearer\r\nto the realm of spirits and the father of all the genii, than to the\r\nworld. He thinks that Paracelsus’s constant comparison of the human\r\nbody with the world is absurd. Yet Van Helmont, at least in his\r\nyouth, was a believer in magnetism, which he employed as a method of\r\nexplaining the effect of sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe archeus exercises the greatest influence on digestion, and he\r\nhas chiefly the stomach and spleen under his superintendence. These\r\ntwo organs form a duumvirate in the body; for the stomach cannot\r\nact alone and without the concurrence of the spleen. Digestion is\r\nproduced by means of an acid liquor, which dissolves the food, under\r\nthe superintendence of the archeus. Van Helmont assures us that he\r\nhad himself tasted this acid liquor in the stomach of birds. Heat,\r\nstrictly speaking, does not favour digestion; for we see no increase of\r\nthe digestive powers during the most ardent fever. Nor are the powers\r\nof digestion wanting in fishes, although they want the animal heat\r\nwhich is requisite for mammiferous animals. Certain birds even digest\r\nfragments of glass, which, certainly, simple heat would not enable them\r\nto do. The pylorus is, in some measure, the director of digestion. It\r\nacts by a peculiar and immaterial power, in virtue of a _blas_, and not\r\nas a muscle. It opens and shuts the stomach according to the orders of\r\nthe archeus. It is in it, therefore, that the causes of derangement of\r\ndigestion must be sought for.\r\n\r\nThe duumvirate just spoken of is the cause of natural sleep, which does\r\nnot belong to the soul, as far as it resides in the stomach. Sleep is\r\na natural action, and one of the first vital actions. Hence the reason\r\nwhy the embryo sleeps without ceasing. At any rate it is not true that\r\nsleep is owing to vapours which mount to the brain. During sleep the\r\nsoul is naturally occupied, and it is then that the deity approaches\r\nmost intimately to man. Accordingly, Van Helmont informs us, that he\r\nreceived in dreams the revelation of several secrets, which he could\r\nnot have learnt otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe duumvirate operates the _first_ digestion, of which, Van Helmont\r\nenumerates six different species. When the acid, which is prepared for\r\ndigestion, passes into the duodenum it is neutralized by the bile of\r\nthe gall-bladder. This constitutes the second digestion. To the bile of\r\nthe gall-bladder, Van Helmont gave the name of _fel_, and he carefully\r\ndistinguished it from the biliary principle in the mass of the blood.\r\nThis last he called _bile_. The _fel_ is not an excrementitious matter,\r\nbut a humour necessary to life, a true vital balsam. Van Helmont\r\nendeavoured to show by various experiments that it is not _bitter_.\r\n\r\nThe _third_ digestion takes place in the vessels of the mesentery,\r\ninto which the gall-bladder sends the prepared fluid. The _fourth_\r\ndigestion is operated in the heart, where the red blood becomes more\r\nyellow and more volatile by the addition of the vital spirits. This\r\nis owing to the passage of the vital spirit from the posterior to the\r\nanterior ventricle, through the pores of the septum. At the same time\r\nthe pulse is produced, which of itself develops heat; but does not\r\nregulate it in any manner, as the ancients pretended that it did. The\r\n_fifth_ digestion consists in the conversion of the arterial blood\r\ninto vital spirit. It takes place principally in the brain, but is\r\nproduced also throughout all the body. The _sixth_ digestion consists\r\nin the elaboration of the nutritive principle in each member, where the\r\narcheus prepares its own nourishment by means of the vital spirits.\r\nThus, there are six digestions: the number seven has been chosen by\r\nnature for a state of repose.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding sketch of the physiology of Van Helmont, it is\r\nevident that he paid little or no regard to the structure of the parts\r\nin explaining the functions. In his pathology we find the same passion\r\nfor spiritualism. He admitted, indeed, the importance of anatomy, but\r\nhe regretted that the pathological part of that science had been so\r\nlittle cultivated. As the archeus is the foundation of life and of all\r\nthe functions, it is plain that the diseases can neither be derived\r\nfrom the four cardinal humours, nor from the disposition or the action\r\nof opposite things; the proximate cause of diseases must be sought for\r\nin the sufferings, the anger, the fear, and the other affections of the\r\narcheus, and their remote cause may be considered as the ideal seed\r\nof the archeus. Disease, in his opinion, is not a negative state or a\r\nmere absence of health, it is a substantial and active thing as well\r\nas a state of health. Most of the diseases which attack certain parts\r\nor members of the body result from an error in the archeus, who sends\r\nhis ferment from the stomach in which he resides into the other parts\r\nof the body. Van Helmont explained in this way not only the epilepsy\r\nand madness, but likewise the _gout_, which does not proceed from a\r\nflux, and has not its seat in the limb in which the pain resides, but\r\nis always owing to an error in the vital spirit. It is true that the\r\ncharacter of the gout acts upon the semen in which the vital spirit\r\nprincipally manifests its action, and that in this way diseases are\r\npropagated in the act of generation; but if, during life instead of\r\naltering the semen it is carried to the liquid of the articulations,\r\nthis is a proof of the prudence of nature, which lavishes all her\r\ncares on the preservation of the species, and loves better to alter\r\nthe humours of the articulations than the semen itself. The gout\r\nacidifies the liquors of the articulations, which is then coagulated\r\nby the acids. The duumvirate is the cause of apoplexy, vertigo, and\r\nparticularly of a species of asthma, which Van Helmont calls _caducus\r\npulmonalis_. Pleurisy is produced in a similar way. The archeus, in a\r\nmovement of rage, sends acrid acids to the lungs, which occasion an\r\ninflammation. Dropsy is also owing to the anger of the archeus, who\r\nprevents the secretions of the kidneys from going on in the usual way.\r\n\r\nOf all the diseases, fever appeared to him most conformable to his\r\nnotions of the unlimited power of the archeus. The causes of fever are\r\nall much more proper to offend the archeus, than to alter the structure\r\nof parts and the mixture of humours. The cold fit is owing to a state\r\nof fear and consternation, into which the archeus is thrown, and the\r\nhot stage results from his disordered movements. All fevers have their\r\npeculiar seat in the duumvirate.\r\n\r\nVan Helmont was in general much more successful in refuting the\r\nscholastic opinions by which the practice of medicine was regulated in\r\nhis time, than in establishing his own. We are struck with the force\r\nof his arguments against the Galenical doctrine of fever, and against\r\nthe influence of the cardinal humours on the different kinds of fever.\r\nHe refuted no less vehemently the idea of the putridity of the blood,\r\nwhile that liquid circulates in the vessels. Perhaps he carried the\r\nopposite doctrine too far; but his opinions have had a good effect upon\r\nsubsequent medical theory, and medical men learned from them to make\r\nless use of the term putridity. The phrase _mixture of humours_, not\r\nmore intelligible, however, came to be substituted for it.\r\n\r\nVan Helmont’s theory of urinary calculi deserves peculiar attention,\r\nbecause it exhibits the germ of a more rational explanation of these\r\nconcretions than had been previously attempted by physiologists. Van\r\nHelmont was aware that Paracelsus, who ascribed these concretions to\r\ntartar, had formed an idea of their nature, which a careful chemical\r\nanalysis would immediately refute. He satisfied himself that urinary\r\ncalculi differ completely from common stones, and that they do not\r\nexist in the food or drink which the calculous person had taken.\r\nTartar, he says, precipitates from wine, not as an earth, but as\r\na crystallized salt. In like manner, the natural salt of urine\r\nprecipitates from that liquid, and gives origin to calculi. We may\r\nimitate this natural process by mixing spirit of urine with rectified\r\nalcohol. Immediately an _offa alba_ is precipitated.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to observe that Van Helmont was mistaken, in supposing\r\nthat this _offa_ was the matter of calculus. Spirit of urine was a\r\nstrong solution of carbonate of ammonia. The alcohol precipitated\r\nthis salt; so that his _offa_ was merely _carbonate of ammonia_. Nor\r\nis there the shadow of evidence that alcohol, as Van Helmont thought\r\nit did, ever makes its way into the mass of humours; yet his notion\r\nof the origin of calculi is not less accurate, though of course he\r\nwas ignorant of the chemical nature of the various substances which\r\nconstitute these calculi. From this reasoning Van Helmont was induced\r\nto reject the term _tartar_, employed by Paracelsus. To avoid all false\r\ninterpretations he substitutes the word _duelech_, to denote the state\r\nin which the spirit of urine precipitates and gives origin to these\r\ncalculous concretions.\r\n\r\nAs all diseases proceeded in his opinion from the archeus, the object\r\nof his treatment was to calm the archeus, to stimulate it, and to\r\nregulate its movements. To accomplish these objects he relied upon\r\ndietetics, and upon acting on the imaginations of his patients. He\r\nconsidered _certain words_ as very efficacious in curing the diseases\r\nof the archeus. He admitted the existence of the universal medicine,\r\nto which he gave the names of _liquor alkahest_, _ens primum salium_,\r\n_primus metallus_. Mercurials, antimonials, opium, and wine, are\r\nparticularly agreeable to the archeus, when in a state of delirium from\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nAmong the mercurial preparations, he praises what he calls _mercurius\r\ndiaphoreticus_ as the best. He gives no account of the mode of\r\npreparing it; but from some circumstances I think it must have been\r\n_calomel_. He considers it as a sovereign remedy in fevers, dropsies,\r\ndiseases of the liver, and ulcers of the lungs. He employed the red\r\noxide of mercury as an external application to ulcers. The principal\r\nantimonial preparations which he employed were the hydrosulphuret, or\r\n_golden sulphur_, and the deutoxide, or _antimonium diaphoreticum_.\r\nThis last medicine was used in scruple doses--a proof of its great\r\ninertness compared with the protoxide of antimony.\r\n\r\nOpium he considered as a fortifying and calming medicine. It contains\r\nan acrid salt and a bitter oil, which give it the virtue of putting a\r\nstop to the errors of the archeus, when it was sending its acid ferment\r\ninto other acid parts of the body. Van Helmont assures us that he\r\nwrought many important cures by the employment of wine.\r\n\r\nSuch is a very short statement of the opinions of a man, who,\r\nnotwithstanding his attachment to the fanatical opinions which\r\ndistinguished the time in which he lived, had the merit of overturning\r\na vast number of errors, both theoretical and practical; and of\r\nlaying down many principles, which, for want of erudition, have been\r\nfrequently assigned to modern writers. Van Helmont has been frequently\r\nplaced on the same level with Paracelsus, and treated like him with\r\ncontempt. But his claims upon the medical world are much higher, and\r\nhis merits infinitely greater. His notions, it is true, were fanatical;\r\nbut his erudition was great, his understanding excellent, and his\r\nindustry indefatigable. His writings did not become known till rather a\r\nlate period; for, with the exception of a single tract, they were not\r\npublished till 1648, by his son, after his death.\r\n\r\nThe decided preference given to chemical medicines by Van Helmont, and\r\nthe uses to which he applies chemical theory, had a natural tendency\r\nto raise chemistry to a higher rank in the eyes of medical men than\r\nit had yet reached. But the man to whom the credit of founding the\r\niatro-chemical sect is due, is Francis de le Boé Sylvius, who was\r\nborn in the year 1614. While a practitioner of medicine at Amsterdam,\r\nhe studied with profound attention the system of Van Helmont, and\r\nthe rival and much more popular theory of Descartes: upon these he\r\nfounded his own theory, which, in reality, contains little entitled to\r\nthe name of original, notwithstanding the tone in which he speaks of\r\nit, and his repeated declarations that he had borrowed from no one.\r\nHe was appointed professor of the theory and practice of medicine in\r\nthe University of Leyden, where he taught with such eclat, and drew\r\nafter him so great a number of pupils, that Boerhaave alone surpassed\r\nhim in this respect. It was he that first introduced the practice of\r\ngiving clinical lectures in the hospitals, on the cases treated in the\r\npresence of the pupils. This admirable innovation has been productive\r\nof much benefit to medicine. He greatly promoted anatomical studies,\r\nand inspected, himself, a vast number of dead bodies. This is the more\r\nremarkable, because his own system, like that of Van Helmont, from whom\r\nit was borrowed, was quite independent of the structure of the parts.\r\n\r\nEvery thing was explained by him according to the principles of\r\nchemistry, as they were then understood. The celebrity of the\r\nuniversity in which he taught, and the vast number of his pupils,\r\ncontributed to spread this theory into every part of the world, and to\r\ngive it an eclat which is really surprising, when we consider it with\r\nattention. But he possessed the talents just suited for securing the\r\nreception of his opinions by his pupils as infallible oracles, and of\r\nbeing the idol of the university. Yet it is melancholy to be obliged to\r\nadd, that few persons ever more abused the favours of nature, or the\r\nadvantages of situation and elocution.\r\n\r\nTo form a clear idea of the principles of this founder of\r\niatro-chemistry, we have only to call to mind the ferments of Van\r\nHelmont, which constitute the foundation-stone of the whole system.\r\nWe cannot, says he, conceive a single change in the mixture of the\r\nhumours, which is not the consequence of fermentation; and yet he\r\nassigns to this fermentation conditions which are scarcely to be\r\nfound united in the living body. Digestion, in his opinion, is a\r\ntrue fermentation produced by the application of a ferment. Like Van\r\nHelmont, he admits a _triumvirate_; but places it in the humours; the\r\neffervescence or fermentation of which enabled him to explain most of\r\nthe functions of the body. Digestion is the result of the mixture of\r\nthe saliva with the pancreatic juice and the bile, and the fermentation\r\nof these humours. The saliva, as well as the pancreatic juice, contains\r\nan acidulous salt easily recognised by the taste. Here Sylvius derives\r\nadvantage from the experiments of Regnier de Graaf on the pancreatic\r\njuice, which he had constantly found acid.\r\n\r\nSylvius, who affirmed that the bile contained an alkali, united with\r\nan oil and a volatile spirit, supposes an effervescence from the union\r\nof the alkali of the bile with the acid of the pancreatic juice, and\r\nthis _fermentation_ he considered as the cause of digestion. By this\r\nfermentation the _chyle_ is produced, which is nothing else than the\r\n_volatile spirit_ of the food accompanied by an _oil_ and an alkali,\r\nneutralized by a weak acid. The blood is more than completed (_plus\r\nquam perficitur_) in the spleen. It acquires its highest perfection by\r\nthe addition of a certain quantity of vital spirits. The _bile_ is not\r\ndrawn from the blood in the liver, but pre-exists in the circulating\r\nfluid. It mixes with that fluid anew to be carried to the heart\r\ntogether with the _lymph_, equally mixed with the blood, and there it\r\ngives origin to a vital fermentation. In this way the blood becomes\r\nthe centre of reunion of all the humours of the secretions, which mix\r\ntogether or separate, without the solids taking the smallest share in\r\nthe operations. Indeed, so completely are the solids banished from\r\nthe system of Sylvius that he attends to nothing whatever except the\r\nhumours.\r\n\r\nThe formation and motion of the blood is explained by the fermentation\r\nof the oily volatile salt of the bile, and the dulcified acid of the\r\nlymph, which develops the vital heat, by which the blood is attenuated\r\nand becomes capable of circulating. This vital fire, quite different\r\nfrom ordinary fire is kept up in its turn by the uniform mixture of the\r\nblood. It attenuates the humours, not because it is _heat_ but because\r\nit is composed of _pyramids_. This last notion is obviously borrowed\r\nfrom Descartes, just as the fermentation in the heart, as the cause of\r\nthe motion of the blood, reminds us of the opinions of Van Helmont.\r\n\r\nSylvius explains the preparation of the vital spirits in the encephalos\r\nby distillation, and he finds a great resemblance between their\r\nproperties and those of spirit of wine. The nerves conduct these\r\nspirits to the different parts, and they spread themselves in the\r\nsubstance of the organs to render them sensible. When they insinuate\r\nthemselves into the glands the addition of the acid of the blood\r\nproduces a liquid analogous to naphtha, which constitutes the _lymph_.\r\nLymph, then, is a compound of the vital spirit and the acid of the\r\nblood. _Milk_ is formed in the mammæ by the afflux of a very mild acid,\r\nwhich gives a white colour to the red humour of the blood.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the natural functions was no less chemical. Even the\r\ndiseases themselves were explained upon chemical principles. Sylvius\r\nfirst introduced the word _acridity_ to denote a predominance of the\r\nchemical elements of the humours, and he looked upon these _acridities_\r\nas the proximate cause of all diseases. But as every thing acrid may be\r\nreferred to one or other of two classes, acids and alkalies, there are\r\nonly two great classes of diseases; namely, those proceeding from an\r\n_acid acridity_, and those proceeding from an _alkaline_.\r\n\r\nSylvius was not altogether ignorant of the constituent parts of the\r\nanimal humours; but it is obvious, from the account of his opinions\r\njust given, that this knowledge was very incomplete; indeed the whole\r\nof his chemical science resolves itself into a comparison of the\r\nhumours of the living body with chemical liquids. Perhaps his notions\r\nrespecting such of the _gases_, as he had occasion to observe, were\r\nsomewhat clearer than those of Van Helmont. He called them _halitus_,\r\nand takes some notice of their different chemical properties, and\r\nstates the influence which he supposes them to exert in certain\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nIn the human body he saw nothing but a magna of humours continually in\r\nfermentation, distillation, effervescence, or precipitation; and the\r\nphysician was degraded by him to the rank of a distiller or a brewer.\r\n\r\nBile acquires different acridities, when bad food, altered air,\r\nor other similar causes act apon the body. It becomes _acid_ or\r\n_alkaline_. In the former case it thickens and occasions obstructions;\r\nin the latter it excites febrile heat; and the viscid vapours elevated\r\nfrom it are the cause of the cold fit with which fever commences. All\r\nacute and continued fevers have their origin in this acridity of the\r\nbile. The vicious mixture of the bile with the blood, or its specific\r\nacridity, produces _jaundice_, which is far from being always owing to\r\nobstructions in the liver. The vicious effervescence of the bile with\r\nthe pancreatic juice produces almost all other diseases. But all these\r\nassertions of Sylvius are unsupported by evidence.\r\n\r\nThe acid acridity of the pancreatic juice, and the obstruction of the\r\npancreatic ducts, which are produced by it, are considered by him as\r\nthe cause of intermittent fevers. When the acid of the pancreatic\r\njuice acquires still more acridity, hypochondriasis and hysteria are\r\nthe consequences of it. If, during the morbid effervescence of the\r\npancreatic juice with the bile an acid and viscid humour arise, the\r\nvital spirits of the heart are overwhelmed during a certain time.\r\nThis occasions syncope, palpitation of the heart, and other nervous\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nWhen the acid acridity of the pancreatic juice or of the lymph (for\r\nboth are similar) is deposited on the nerves, the consequence is spasms\r\nor convulsions; epilepsy in particular depends upon the acrid vapours\r\nproduced by the morbid effervescence of the pancreatic juice with acrid\r\nbile. Gout has the same origin as intermittent fevers, for we must look\r\nfor it in the obstruction of the pancreas and the lymphatic glands,\r\naccompanied with an acid acridity of the lymph. Rheumatism is owing to\r\nthe acrid acid, deprived of the oil which dulcifies it. The smallpox is\r\noccasioned by an acid acridity in the lymph, which gives origin to the\r\npustules. Indeed all suppuration in general is owing to a coagulating\r\nacid in the lymph. Syphilis results from a caustic acid in the lymph.\r\nThe itch is produced by an acid acridity of the lymph. Dropsies are\r\nproduced by the same acid acridity of the lymph. Urinary calculi are\r\nthe consequences of a coagulating acid existing in the lymph and the\r\npancreatic juice. Corrosive acids, and the loss of volatile spirits,\r\noccasion leucorrhœa.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding statement it would appear that almost all diseases\r\nproceed from acids. However, Sylvius informs us that malignant fevers\r\nare owing to a superabundance of volatile salts and to a too great\r\ntenuity of the blood. The vital spirits themselves give occasion to\r\ndiseases. They are sometimes too aqueous, sometimes they effervesce too\r\nviolently, and sometimes not at all. Hence all the nervous diseases,\r\nwhich Sylvius never considers as existing by themselves; but as always\r\nderived from the acid, acrid, or alkaline vapours which trouble the\r\nvital spirits.\r\n\r\nThe method of cure which Sylvius deduced from these absurd and\r\ncontemptible hypotheses, was worthy of the hypotheses themselves;\r\nand certainly constitute the most detestable mode of treatment that\r\never has disgraced medical science. To diseases produced by the\r\neffervescence of the bile he opposed purgatives; because in his\r\nopinion emetics produced injurious effects. The reason was, that the\r\nemetics which he employed were too violent, consisting of antimonial\r\npreparations, particularly _powder of Algerotti_, or an impure\r\nprotoxide of antimony. For though _emetic tartar_ had been discovered\r\nin 1630, it does not seem to have come into use till a much later\r\nperiod. We do not find any notice of it in the _praxis chymiatrica_ of\r\nHartmann published in 1647, at Geneva.\r\n\r\nHe endeavoured to moderate the acridity of the bile by opiates and\r\nother narcotics. It will scarcely be believed, though it was a natural\r\nconsequence of his opinions, when we state that he recommended\r\nammoniacal preparations, particularly his oleaginous volatile salt, and\r\nspirit of hartshorn, &c., as cures for almost all diseases. Sometimes\r\nthey were employed to correct the acidity of the lymph, sometimes\r\nto destroy the acid acridity of the pancreatic juice, sometimes to\r\ncorrect the inertness of the vital spirits, sometimes to promote the\r\nsecretions, and to induce a flow of the menses. Volatile spirit of\r\namber and opium were prescribed by him in intermittent fevers; and\r\nvolatile salts in almost all acute diseases. He united them with\r\nantivenomous potions, angelica, contrayerva, bezoard, crabs’ eyes, and\r\nother similar substances. These absorbents seemed to him very necessary\r\nto correct the acidity of the pancreatic juice, and the acridity of the\r\nbile. In administering them he paid no attention to the regular course\r\nwhich acute diseases usually run; he neither inquired into the remote\r\nnor proximate causes of disease, nor to the symptoms: every thing was\r\nneglected connected with induction, and his whole proceedings regulated\r\nby wild speculations and absurd theories, quite inconsistent with the\r\nphenomena of nature.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to refute these wild notions of Sylvius would be loss of\r\ntime. It is extraordinary, and almost incredible, that he could have\r\nregulated his practice by them: and it is a still more incredible\r\nthing, and exhibits a very humiliating view of human nature, that these\r\ncrudities and absurdities were swallowed with avidity by crowds of\r\nstudents, who placed a blind reliance on the dogmas of their master,\r\nand were initiated by him into a method of treating their patients,\r\nbetter calculated than any other that could easily have been devised,\r\nto aggravate all their diseases, and put an end to their lives. If any\r\nof the patients of the iatro-chemists ever recovered their health, well\r\nmight it be said that their recovery was not the consequence of the\r\nprescriptions of their physicians, but that it took place in spite of\r\nthem.[168]\r\n\r\n[168] As an example of the prescriptions of Sylvius, we give the\r\nfollowing for malignant fever:\r\n\r\n  _R._ Theriac. veter. ᴣij\r\n       Antim. diaphor. ᴣj\r\n       Syrup. Card. Benedic. ℥ij\r\n       Aq. prophylact. ℥j\r\n       -- Cinnam. ℥ss\r\n       -- Scabios. ℥ij\r\n  M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a very remarkable circumstance, and shows clearly that mankind\r\nin general had become disgusted with the dogmas of the Galenists,\r\nthat iatro-chemistry was adopted more or less completely by almost\r\nall physicians. There were, indeed, a few individuals who raised\r\ntheir voices against it; but, what is curious and inexplicable, they\r\nnever attempted to start objections against the principles of the\r\niatro-chemists, or to point out the futility of their hypothesis, and\r\ntheir inconsistency with fact. They combated them by arguments not more\r\nsolid than those of their antagonists.\r\n\r\nDuring the presidency of Riolan over the Medical College of Paris,\r\nthat learned body set itself against all innovations. Guy Patin, who\r\nwas a medical professor in the University of Paris, and a man of great\r\ncelebrity, opposed the chemical system of medicine with much zeal. In\r\nhis Martyrologium Antimonii he collects all the cases in which the use\r\nof antimony, as a medicine, had proved injurious to the patient. But\r\nin the year 1666, the dispute relative to antimony, and particularly\r\nrelative to tartar emetic, became so violent, that all the doctors of\r\nthe faculty of Paris were assembled by an order of the parliament,\r\nunder the presidency of Dean Vignon, and after a long deliberation,\r\nit was concluded by a majority of ninety-two votes, that tartar\r\nemetic, and other antimonials, should not only be permitted, but even\r\nrecommended. Patin after this decision pretended no longer to combat\r\nchemical medicine; but he did not remain inactive. One of his friends,\r\nFrancis Blondel, demanded the resolution to be cancelled; but his\r\nexertions were unsuccessful; nor were the writings of Guillemeau and\r\nMenjot, who were also keen partisans of the views of Patin, attended\r\nwith better success.\r\n\r\nIn England iatro-chemistry assumed a direction quite peculiar. It was\r\nembraced by a set of men who had cultivated anatomy with the most\r\nmarked success, and who were quite familiar with the experimental\r\nmethod of investigating nature. The most eminent of all the English\r\nsupporters of iatro-chemistry was Thomas Willis, who was a contemporary\r\nof Sylvius.\r\n\r\nDr. Willis was born at Great Bodmin, in Wiltshire, in 1621. He was\r\na student at Christchurch College, in Oxford, when that city was\r\ngarrisoned for King Charles I. Like the other students, he bore arms\r\nfor his Majesty, and devoted his leisure hours to the study of physic.\r\nAfter the surrender of Oxford to the parliament, he devoted himself to\r\nthe practice of medicine, and soon acquired reputation. He appropriated\r\na room as an oratory for divine service, according to the forms of\r\nthe church of England, to which most of the loyalists of Oxford daily\r\nresorted. In 1660, he became Sedleian professor of natural philosophy,\r\nand the same year he took the degree of doctor of physic. He settled\r\nultimately in London, and soon acquired a higher reputation, and a more\r\nextensive practice, than any of his contemporaries. He died in 1675,\r\nand was buried in Westminster Abbey. He was a first-rate anatomist. To\r\nhim we are indebted for the first accurate description of the brain and\r\nnerves.\r\n\r\nBut it is as an iatro-chemist that he claims a place in this work. His\r\nnotions approach nearer to those of Paracelsus than to the hypotheses\r\nof Van Helmont and Sylvius. He admits the three chemical elements of\r\nParacelsus, salt, sulphur, and mercury, in all the bodies in nature,\r\nand employs them to explain their properties and changes; but he gives\r\nthe name of _spirit_ to the _mercury_ of Paracelsus. He ascribes to it\r\nthe virtue of volatilizing all the constituent parts of bodies: salt,\r\non the other hand, is the cause of fixity in bodies; _sulphur_ produces\r\ncolour and heat, and unites the _spirit_ to the _salt_. In the stomach\r\nthere occurs an acid ferment, which forms the chyle with the sulphur\r\nof the aliments: this chyle enters into effervescence in the heart,\r\nbecause the salt and sulphur take fire together. From this results\r\nthe vital flame, which penetrates every thing. The vital spirits are\r\nsecreted in the brain by a real distillation. The vessels of the testes\r\ndraw an elixir from the constituent parts of the blood; but the spleen\r\nretains the earthy part, and communicates a new igneous ferment to the\r\ncirculating fluid. On this account the blood must be considered as a\r\nhumour, constantly disposed to fermentation, and in this respect it may\r\nbe compared to wine. Every humour in which salt, sulphur, and spirit\r\npredominates in a certain manner, may be converted into a _ferment_.\r\nAll diseases proceed from a morbid state or action of this ferment; and\r\na physician may be compared to a wine-merchant; for, like him, he has\r\nnothing to do but to watch that the necessary fermentations take place\r\nwith regularity, and that no foreign substance come to derange the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nAt this period the mania of explaining every thing had proceeded to\r\nsuch a length, that no distinction was made between dead and living\r\nbodies. The chemical facts which were at that time known, were applied\r\nwithout hesitation to explain all the functions and all the diseases\r\nof the living body. According to Willis, fever is the simple result\r\nof a violent and preternatural effervescence of the blood and the\r\nother humours of the body, either produced by external causes, or by\r\ninternal ferments, into which the chyle is converted when it mixes\r\nwith the blood. The effervescence of the vital spirits is the source\r\nof quotidians; that of salt and sulphur produces continued fever; and\r\nexternal ferments of a malignant nature produce malignant fevers. Thus\r\nthe smallpox is owing to the seeds of fermentation set in activity by\r\nan external principle of contagion. Spasms and convulsions are produced\r\nby an explosion of the salt and sulphur with the animal spirits.\r\nHypochondriacal affections and hysteria depend originally on the morbid\r\nputrifaction of the blood in the spleen, or on a bad fermentescible\r\nprinciple, loaded with salt and sulphur, which unites with the vital\r\nspirits and deranges them. Scurvy is owing to an alteration of the\r\nblood, which may then be compared to vapid or stale wine. The gout is\r\nmerely the coagulation of the nutritive juices altered by the acidified\r\nanimal spirits; just as sulphuric acid forms a coagulum with carbonate\r\nof potash.\r\n\r\nThe action of medicines is easily explained by the effects which they\r\nproduce on the nourishing principles. Sudorifics are considered as\r\ncordials, because they augment the sulphur of the blood, which is the\r\ntrue food of the vital flame. Cordials purify the animal spirits,\r\nand fix the too volatile blood. Willis disagrees with the other\r\niatro-chemists of his time in one thing: he recommends bleeding in\r\nthe greater number of diseases, as an excellent method of diminishing\r\nunnatural fermentation.\r\n\r\nDr. Croone, a celebrated Fellow of the Royal Society, was another\r\nEnglish iatro-chemist, who attempted to explain muscular motion by the\r\neffervescence of the nervous fluid, or animal spirits.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while to notice the host of writers--English, French,\r\nItalian, Dutch, and German, who exerted themselves to maintain,\r\nimprove, and defend, the chemical doctrines of medicine. The first\r\nperson who attempted to overturn these absurd doctrines, and to\r\nintroduce something more satisfactory in their place, was Mr. Boyle, at\r\nthat time in the height of his celebrity.\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle was born at Youghall, in the province of Munster, on the\r\n25th of January, 1627. He was the seventh son, and the fourteenth\r\nchild of Richard, Earl of Cork. He was partly educated at home, and\r\npartly at Eton, where he was under the tuition of Sir Henry Wotton. At\r\nthe age of eleven, he travelled with his brother and a French tutor\r\nthrough France to Geneva, where he pursued his studies for twenty-one\r\nmonths, and then went to Italy. During this period, he acquired the\r\nFrench and Italian languages; and, indeed, talked in the former with\r\nso much fluency and correctness, that he passed, when he thought\r\nproper, for a Frenchman. In 1642, his father’s finances were deranged,\r\nby the breaking out of the great Irish rebellion. His tutor, who was\r\na Genevese, was obliged to borrow, on his own credit, a sum of money\r\nsufficient to carry him home. On his arrival, he found his father dead;\r\nand, though two estates had been left to him, such was the state of the\r\ntimes, that several years elapsed before he could command the requisite\r\nsum of money to supply his exigencies. He retired to an estate at\r\nStalbridge, in Dorsetshire.\r\n\r\nIn 1654 he went to Oxford, where he associated himself with a number of\r\neminent men (Dr. Willis among others), who had constituted themselves\r\ninto a combination for experimental investigations, distinguished by\r\nthe name of the _Philosophical College_. This society was transferred\r\nto London; and, in 1663, was incorporated by Charles II. under the\r\nname of the _Royal Society_. In 1668 Mr. Boyle took up his residence\r\nin London, where he continued till the last day of December, 1691,\r\nassiduously occupied in experimental investigations, on which day he\r\ndied, in the sixty-fifth year of his age.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Mr. Boyle for the first introduction of the air-pump\r\nand the thermometer into Britain, and for contributing so much, by\r\nmeans of Dr. Hooke, to the improvement of both. His hydrostatical and\r\npneumatical investigations and experiments constitute the foundation\r\nof these two sciences. The thermometer was first made an accurate\r\ninstrument of investigation by Sir Isaac Newton, in 1701. This he\r\ndid by selecting as two fixed points the temperatures at which water\r\nfreezes and boils; marking these upon the stem of the thermometer,\r\nand dividing the interval between them into a certain number of\r\ndegrees. All thermometers made in this way will stand at the same\r\npoint when plunged into bodies of the same temperature. The number of\r\ndivisions between the freezing and boiling points constitute the cause\r\nof the differences between different thermometers. In Fahrenheit’s\r\nthermometer, which is used in Great Britain, the number of degrees,\r\nbetween the freezing and boiling points of water, is 180; in Reaumur’s\r\nit is 80; in Celsius’s, or the centigrade, it is 100; and in De Lisle’s\r\nit is 150.\r\n\r\nBut my reason for mentioning Mr. Boyle here was, the attempt which he\r\nmade in 1661, by the publication of his Sceptical Chemist, to overturn\r\nthe absurd opinions of the iatro-chemists. He raises doubts, not only\r\nrespecting the existence of the elements of the Peripatetics, but even\r\nof those of the chemists. The first elements of bodies, in his opinion,\r\nare _atoms_, of different shapes and sizes; the union of which gives\r\norigin to what we vulgarly call _elements_. We cannot restrain the\r\nnumber of these to four, as the Peripatetics do; nor to three, with the\r\nchemists: neither are they immutable, but convertible into each other.\r\nFire is not the means that ought to be employed to obtain them; for\r\nthe _salt_ and _sulphur_ are formed during its action by the union of\r\ndifferent simple bodies.\r\n\r\nBoyle shows, besides, that the chemical theory of qualities is\r\nexceedingly inaccurate and uncertain; because it takes for granted\r\nthings which are very doubtful, and in many cases directly contrary\r\nto the phenomena of nature. He endeavours to prove the truth of these\r\nideas, and particularly the production of the chemical principles, by a\r\ngreat number of convincing and conclusive experiments.\r\n\r\nIn another treatise, entitled “The Imperfections of the Chemical\r\nDoctrine of Qualities,”[169] he points out, in the second section, the\r\ninsufficiency of the hypotheses of Sylvius relative to the generality\r\nof acids and alkalies. He shows that the offices ascribed to them\r\nare arbitrary, and the notions respecting them unsettled; that the\r\nhypotheses respecting them are needless, and insufficient, and afford\r\nbut an unsatisfactory solution of the phenomena.\r\n\r\n[169] Shaw’s Boyle, iii, 424.\r\n\r\nThese arguments of Boyle did not immediately shake the credit of the\r\nchemical system. In the year 1691, a chemical academy was founded\r\nat Paris by Nicolas de Blegny, the express object of which was to\r\nexamine these objections of Boyle, which by this time had attracted\r\ngreat attention. Boyle’s experiments were repeated and confirmed; but\r\nthe academicians, notwithstanding, came to the conclusion, that it is\r\nunnecessary to have recourse to the true elements of bodies; and that\r\nthe phenomena which occur in the animal economy may be explained by the\r\npredominance of acids or alkalies. Various other publications appeared,\r\nall on the same side.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, Hermann Conringius, the most skilful physician of his time,\r\nopposed the chemical theory; and his opinions were impugned by Olaus\r\nBorrichius, who defended not only alchymy, but the chemical theory of\r\nmedicine, with equal erudition and zeal.[170]\r\n\r\n[170] De Ortu et Progressu Chemiæ. _Hafniæ_, 1674.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the sixteenth century, the chemists thought of\r\nexamining the liquids of the living body, to ascertain whether they\r\nreally contained the acids and alkalies which had been assigned them,\r\nand considered as the cause of all diseases. But at that time chemistry\r\nhad made so little progress, and such was the want of skill of those\r\nwho undertook these investigations, that they readily obtained every\r\nthing that was wanted to confirm their previous notions. John Viridet,\r\na physician of Geneva, announced that he had found an acid in the\r\nsaliva and the pancreatic juice, and an alkali in the gastric juice\r\nand the bile. But the most celebrated experiments of that period were\r\nthose of Raimond Vieussens, undertaken in 1698, in order to discover\r\nthe presence of an acid spirit in the blood. His method was, to mix\r\nblood with a species of clay, called _bole_, and to subject the mixture\r\nto distillation. He found that the liquid distilled over was acid.\r\nCharmed with this discovery, which he considered as of first-rate\r\nimportance, he announced it by letter to the different academies and\r\ncolleges in Europe. Some doubts being raised about the accuracy of\r\nhis experiment, it having been alleged that the acid came from the\r\nclay which he had mixed with the blood, and not from the blood itself,\r\nVieussens purified the _bole_ from all the acid which it could contain,\r\nand repeated his experiment again. The result was the same--the acrid\r\nsalt of the fluid yielded an acid spirit.\r\n\r\nIt would be needless in the present state of our knowledge to point\r\nout the inaccuracy of such an experiment, or how little it contributed\r\nto prove that blood contains a free acid. It is now well known to\r\nchemists, that blood is remarkably free from acids; and, that if we\r\nexcept a little common salt, which exists in all the liquids of the\r\nhuman body, there is neither any acid nor salt whatever in that liquid.\r\n\r\nMichael Ettmuller, at Leipsic, who was a chemist of some eminence in\r\nhis day, and published a small treatise on the science, which was much\r\nsought after, was also a zealous iatro-chemist; but his opinions were\r\nobviously regulated by the researches of Boyle. He denies the existence\r\nof acids and alkalies in certain bodies, and distinguishes carefully\r\nbetween acid and putrid fermentation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most formidable antagonists to the iatro-chemical doctrines\r\nwas Dr. Archibald Pitcairne, first a professor of medicine in the\r\nUniversity of Leyden, and afterwards of Edinburgh, and one of the most\r\neminent physicians of his time. He was born in Edinburgh, on the 25th\r\nof December, 1652. After finishing his school education in Dalkeith,\r\nhe went to the University of Edinburgh, where he improved himself in\r\nclassical learning, and completed a regular course of philosophy. He\r\nturned his attention to the law, and prosecuted his studies with so\r\nmuch ardour and intensity that his health began to suffer. He was\r\nadvised to travel, and set out accordingly for the South of France: by\r\nthe time he reached Paris he was so far recovered that he determined\r\nto renew his studies; but as there was no eminent professor of law in\r\nthat city, and as several gentlemen of his acquaintance were engaged in\r\nthe study of medicine, he went with them to the lectures and hospitals,\r\nand employed himself in this way for several months, till his affairs\r\ncalled him home.\r\n\r\nOn his return he applied himself chiefly to mathematics, in which,\r\nunder the auspices of his friend, the celebrated Dr. David Gregory, he\r\nmade uncommon progress. Struck with the charms of this science, and\r\nhoping by the application of it to medicine to reduce the healing art\r\nunder the rigid rules of mathematical demonstration, he formed the\r\nresolution of devoting himself to the study of medicine. There was at\r\nthat time no medical school in Edinburgh, and no hospital at which he\r\ncould improve himself; he therefore repaired to Paris, and devoted\r\nhimself to his studies with a degree of ardour that ensured an almost\r\nunparalleled success. In 1680 he received from the faculty of Rheims\r\nthe degree of doctor of medicine, a degree also conferred on him in\r\n1699 by the University of Aberdeen.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1691 his reputation was so high that the University of\r\nLeyden solicited him to fill the medical chair, at that time vacant;\r\nhe accepted the invitation, and delivered a course of lectures at\r\nLeyden, which was greatly admired by all his auditors, among whom\r\nwere Boerhaave and Mead. At the close of the session he set out for\r\nScotland, to marry the daughter of Sir Archibald Stevenson: his friends\r\nin his own country would not consent to part with him, and thus he was\r\nreluctantly obliged to resign his chair in the University of Leyden.\r\n\r\nHe settled as a physician in Edinburgh, where he was appointed titular\r\nprofessor of medicine. His practice extended beyond example, and he was\r\nmore consulted by foreigners than any Edinburgh physician either before\r\nor after his time. He died in October, 1713, admired and regretted by\r\nthe whole country. He was a zealous supporter of iatro-mathematics, and\r\nas such a professed antagonist of the iatro-chemists. He refuted their\r\nopinions with much strength of reasoning, while his high reputation\r\ngave his opinions an uncommon effect; so that he contributed perhaps as\r\nmuch as any one, to put a period to the most disgraceful, as well as\r\ndangerous, set of opinions that ever overspread the medical horizon.\r\n\r\nInto the merits of the iatro-mathematicians it is not the business of\r\nthis work to enter; they at least display science, and labour, and\r\nerudition, and in all these respects are far before the iatro-chemists.\r\nPerhaps their own opinions were not more agreeable to the real\r\nstructure of the human body, nor their practice more conformable to\r\nreason, or more successful than those of the chemists. Probably the\r\nmost valuable of all Dr. Pitcairne’s writings, is his vindication of\r\nthe claims of Hervey to the great discovery of the circulation.\r\n\r\nBoerhaave, the pupil of Pitcairne, and afterwards a professor\r\nin Leyden, was a no less zealous or successful opponent of the\r\niatro-chemists.\r\n\r\nHerman Boerhaave, perhaps the most celebrated physician that ever\r\nexisted, if we except Hippocrates, was born at Voorhout, a village near\r\nLeyden, in 1668, where his father was the parish clergyman. At the age\r\nof sixteen he was left without parents, protection, advice, or fortune.\r\nHe had already studied theology, and the other branches of knowledge\r\nthat are considered as requisite for a clergyman, to which situation he\r\naspired; and while occupied with these studies he supported himself at\r\nLeyden by teaching mathematics to the students--a branch of knowledge\r\nto which he had devoted himself with considerable ardour while living\r\nin his father’s house. But, a report being raised that he was attached\r\nto the doctrines of Spinoza, the clamour against him was so loud\r\nthat he thought it requisite to renounce his intention of going into\r\n_orders_.[171] He turned his studies to medicine, and the branches of\r\nscience connected with that pursuit, and these delightful subjects soon\r\nengrossed the whole of his attention. In 1693 he was created doctor of\r\nmedicine, and began to practise. He continued to teach mathematics for\r\nsome time, till his practice increased sufficiently to enable him to\r\nlive by his fees. His spare money was chiefly laid out upon books; he\r\nalso erected a chemical laboratory, and though he had no garden he paid\r\ngreat attention to the study of plants. His reputation increased with\r\nconsiderable rapidity; but his fortune rather slowly. He was invited to\r\nthe Hague by a nobleman, who stood high in the favour of William III.,\r\nKing of Great Britain; but he declined the invitation. His three great\r\nfriends, to whom he was in some measure indebted for his success, were\r\nJames Trigland, professor of theology, Daniel Alphen, and John Van den\r\nBerg, both of them successively chief magistrates of Leyden, and men of\r\ngreat influence.\r\n\r\n[171] While travelling in a tract-boat, one of his fellow-travellers\r\nmore orthodox than well informed, attacked the system of Spinoza with\r\nso little spirit, that Boerhaave was tempted to ask him if he had ever\r\nread Spinoza. The polemic was obliged to confess that he had not; but\r\nhe was so much provoked at this public exposure of his ignorance, that\r\nhe propagated the report of Boerhaave’s attachment to Spinozism, and\r\nthus blasted his intention of becoming a clergyman.\r\n\r\nVan den Berg recommended him to the situation of professor of medicine\r\nin the University of Leyden, to which chair he was raised, fortunately\r\nfor the reputation of the university, on the death of Drelincourt,\r\nin 1702. He not only gave public lectures on medicine, but was in\r\nthe habit also of giving private instructions to his pupils. His\r\nsuccess as a teacher was so great, that a report having been spread\r\nof his intention to quit Leyden, the curators of the university added\r\nconsiderably to his salary on condition that he would not leave them.\r\n\r\nThis first step towards fortune and eminence having been made, others\r\nfollowed with great rapidity. He was appointed successively professor\r\nof botany and of chemistry, while rectorships and deanships were\r\nshowered upon him with an unsparing hand. And such was the activity,\r\nthe zeal, and the ability with which he filled all these chairs,\r\nthat he raised the University of Leyden to the very highest rank of\r\nall the universities of Europe. Students flocked to him from all\r\nquarters--every country of Europe furnished him with pupils; Leyden\r\nwas filled and enriched by an unusual crowd of strangers. Though his\r\nclass-rooms were large, yet so great was the number of students, that\r\nit was customary for them to keep places, just as is done in a theatre\r\nwhen a first-rate actor is expected to perform. He died in the year\r\n1738, while still filling the three different chairs with undiminished\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nIt is not our object here to speak of Boerhaave as a physician, or as a\r\nteacher of medicine, or of botany; though in all these capacities he is\r\nentitled to the very highest eulogium; his practice was as unexampled\r\nas his success as a teacher. It is solely as a chemist that he claims\r\nour attention here. His system of chemistry, published in two quarto\r\nvolumes in 1732, and of which we have an excellent English translation\r\nby Dr. Shaw, printed in 1741, was undoubtedly the most learned and\r\nmost luminous treatise on chemistry that the world had yet seen; it\r\nis nothing less than a complete collection of all the chemical facts\r\nand processes which were known in Boerhaave’s time, collected from\r\na thousand different sources, and from writings equally disgusting\r\nfrom their obscurity and their mysticism. Every thing is stated in\r\nthe plainest way, stripped of all mystery, and chemistry is shown as\r\na science and an art of the first importance, not merely to medicine,\r\nbut to mankind in general. The processes given by him are too numerous\r\nand too tedious to have been all repeated by one man, how laborious\r\nsoever he may have been: many of them have been taken upon trust, and,\r\nas no distinction is made in the book, between those which are stated\r\nupon his own authority and those which are merely copied from others,\r\nthis treatise has been accused, and with some justice, as not always\r\nto be depended on. But the real information which it communicates is\r\nprodigious, and when we compare it with any other system of chemistry\r\nthat preceded it, the superiority of Boerhaave’s information will\r\nappear in a very conspicuous point of view.\r\n\r\nAfter a short but valuable historical introduction he divides his work\r\ninto two parts; the first treats of the _theory of chemistry_, the\r\nsecond of the _practical processes_.\r\n\r\nHe defines chemistry as follows: “Chemistry is an art which teaches\r\nthe manner of performing certain physical operations, whereby bodies\r\ncognizable to the senses, or capable of being rendered cognizable,\r\nand of being contained in vessels, are so changed by means of proper\r\ninstruments, as to produce certain determinate effects; and at the same\r\ntime discover the causes thereof; for the service of various arts.”\r\n\r\nThis definition is not calculated to throw much light on chemistry to\r\nthose who are unacquainted with its nature and object. Neither is it\r\nconformable to the modern notions entertained of chemistry; but it is\r\nrequisite to keep in mind Boerhaave’s definition of chemistry, when\r\nwe examine his system, that we may not accuse him of omissions and\r\nimperfections, which are owing merely to the state of the science when\r\nhe gave his system to the world.\r\n\r\nIn his theory of chemistry he begins with the metals, which he treats\r\nof in the following order: Gold, mercury, lead, silver, copper, iron,\r\ntin. The account of them, though imperfect, is much fuller and more\r\nsatisfactory than any that preceded it. He then treats of the salts,\r\nwhich are, common salt, saltpetre, borax, sal ammoniac and alum. This\r\nit will be admitted is but a meagre list. However other salts occur in\r\ndifferent parts of the book which are not described here. He next gives\r\nan account of sulphur. Here he introduces _white arsenic_, obtained,\r\nhe says, from cobalt, and not known for more than two hundred years.\r\nHe considers it as a real sulphur, and takes no notice of metallic\r\narsenic, though it had been already alluded to by Paracelsus. He then\r\ntreats of bitumens, including under the name not merely bitumens liquid\r\nand solid, but likewise pit-coal, amber, and ambergris. An account\r\nof stones and earths comes next, and constitutes the most defective\r\npart of the book. It is very surprising that in this part of his work\r\nhe takes no notice of _lime_. The semi-metals come next: they are,\r\nantimony, bismuth, zinc. Here he gives an account of the three vitriols\r\nor sulphates of iron, copper, and zinc. He knew the composition of\r\nsulphate of iron; but was ignorant of that of sulphate of copper and\r\nsulphate of zinc. He considers semi-metals as compounds of a true metal\r\nand sulphur, and therefore enumerates cinnabar among the semi-metals.\r\nLastly he treats of vegetables and animals; and it is needless to say\r\nthat his account is very imperfect.\r\n\r\nHe next treats of the utility of chemistry, and shows its importance\r\nin natural philosophy, medicine, and the arts. Afterwards he describes\r\nthe instruments of chemistry. This constitutes the longest and the most\r\nimportant part of the whole work. He first treats of fire at great\r\nlength. Here we have an account of the thermometer, of the expansion\r\nproduced by heat, of steam, and in fact the germ of many of the most\r\nimportant parts of the science of heat, which have since been expanded\r\nand applied to the improvement, not merely of chemistry, but of the\r\narts and resources of human industry. The experiments of Fahrenheit\r\nrelated by him, on the change of temperature induced by agitating water\r\nand mercury together at different degrees of heat, gave origin to the\r\nwhole doctrine of specific heats. Though Boerhaave himself seemed not\r\naware of the importance of these experiments, or indeed even to have\r\nconsidered them with any attention. But when afterwards analyzed by Dr.\r\nBlack, these experiments gave origin to one of the most important parts\r\nof the whole science of heat.\r\n\r\nHe next treats at great length on _fuel_. Here his opinions are often\r\nvery erroneous, from his ignorance of a vast number of facts which\r\nhave since come to light. It is curious that during the whole of his\r\nvery long account of combustion he makes no allusion to the peculiar\r\nopinions of Stahl on the subject; though they were known to the public,\r\nand had been admitted by chemists in general, before his work was\r\npublished. To what are we to ascribe this omission? It could scarcely\r\nhave been owing to ignorance, Stahl’s reputation being too high to\r\nallow his opinions to be treated with neglect. We must suppose, I\r\nthink, that Boerhaave did not adopt Stahl’s doctrine of combustion; but\r\nat the same time did not think it proper to enter into any controversy\r\non the subject.\r\n\r\nHe next treats of the heat produced when different liquids are mixed,\r\nas alcohol and water, &c. He gives many examples of such increase\r\nof temperature, and describes the phenomena very correctly. But he\r\nwas unable to assign the cause of the evolution of this heat. The\r\nsubject was elucidated many years after by Dr. Irvine, who showed that\r\nit was owing to a diminution of the specific heat which takes place\r\nwhen liquids combine chemically together. It is in this part of his\r\nwork that he gives an account of phosphorus, of the action of nitric\r\nacid on volatile oils, and he concludes, from all the facts which he\r\nstates, that elementary fire is a corporeal body. His explanation\r\nof the combustion of Homberg’s pyrophorus and of common phosphorus,\r\nshows clearly that he had no correct notion of the reason why air is\r\nnecessary to maintain combustion, nor of the way in which that elastic\r\nfluid performs its part in the great phenomena of nature.\r\n\r\nHe next treats of the mode of regulating fire for chemical purposes:\r\nthen he treats of _air_, his account being chiefly taken from Boyle.\r\nHe ascribes the discovery of the law of the elasticity of air both\r\nto Boyle and Mariotte. Boyle, I believe, was the first discoverer of\r\nit. The French are in the habit of calling it the law of Mariotte.\r\nHe then treats of _water_, and lastly of _earth_; but even here no\r\nmention whatever is made of lime. In the last part of the theory of\r\nchemistry he treats at great length of menstruums. These are water,\r\noils, alcohol, alkalies, acids, and neutral salts. He mentions potash\r\nand ammonia, but takes no notice of soda; the difference between potash\r\nand soda not being accurately known. Nor can we expect any particular\r\naccount of the difference between the properties of mild and caustic\r\npotash; as this subject was not understood till the time of Dr. Black.\r\nThe only acids which he mentions are the _acetic_, _sulphuric_,\r\n_nitric_, _muriatic_, and _aqua regia_. He subjoins a disquisition on\r\nthe alcahest or universal solvent, which it is obvious enough, however,\r\nfrom the way in which he speaks of it, that he was not a believer in.\r\nThe object of his practical part is to teach the method of making all\r\nthe different chemical substances known when he wrote. This he does in\r\ntwo hundred and twenty-seven processes, in which all the manipulations\r\nare described with considerable minuteness. This part of the work must\r\nhave been long considered as of great utility, and must have been long\r\nresorted to by the student as a mine of practical information upon\r\nalmost every subject that could arrest his attention. So immense is\r\nthe progress that chemistry has made since the days of Boerhaave, and\r\nso different are the researches that at present occupy chemists, and\r\nso much greater the degree of precision requisite to be attained, that\r\nhis processes and directions are now of little or no use to a practical\r\nstudent of chemistry, as they convey little or none of the knowledge\r\nwhich it is requisite for him to possess.\r\n\r\nBoerhaave made a set of most elaborate experiments, to refute the ideas\r\nof the alchymists respecting the possibility of fixing mercury. He\r\nput a quantity of pure mercury into a glass vessel, and kept it for\r\nfifteen years at a temperature rather higher than 100°. It underwent no\r\nalteration whatever, excepting that a small portion of it was converted\r\ninto a black powder. But this black powder was restored to the state of\r\nrunning mercury by trituration in a mortar. In this experiment the air\r\nhad free access to the mercury. It was repeated in a close vessel with\r\nthe same result, excepting that the mercury was kept hot for only six\r\nmonths instead of fifteen years.\r\n\r\nTo show that mercury cannot be obtained from metals by the processes\r\nrecommended by the alchymists, he dissolved pure nitrate of lead in\r\nwater, and, mixing the solution with sal ammoniac, chloride of lead\r\nprecipitated. Of this chloride he put a quantity into a retort, and\r\npoured over it a strong lixivium of caustic potash, The whole was\r\ndigested at the temperature of 96° for six months and six days. It was\r\nthen distilled in a glass retort, by a temperature gradually raised to\r\nredness, but not a particle of mercury was evaporated, as it had been\r\nalleged by the alchymists would be the case.\r\n\r\nIsaac Hollandus had stated that mercury could be easily obtained from\r\nthe salt of lead made by means of distilled vinegar. To prove this he\r\ncalcined a quantity of acetate of lead, ground the residue to powder,\r\nand triturated it with a very strong alkaline lixivium, and kept the\r\nlixivium over it covered with paper for months, taking care to add\r\nwater in proportion as it evaporated. The calx was then distilled in\r\na heat gradually raised to redness; but not a particle of mercury was\r\nobtained.[172]\r\n\r\n[172] Mem. Paris, 1734, p. 539.\r\n\r\nThese were not the only laborious experiments which he made with this\r\nmetal. He distilled it above five hundred times, and found that it\r\nunderwent no alteration. When long agitated in a glass bottle it is\r\nconvertible into a black acrid powder, obviously protoxide of mercury.\r\nThis black powder, when distilled, is converted into running mercury.\r\nExposure of mercury for some months in a heat of 180°, converts it also\r\ninto protoxide; and if the heat be higher than this, the mercury is\r\nconverted into a red acrid substance, obviously peroxide of mercury.\r\nBut this peroxide, by simple distillation, is again reduced into the\r\nstate of running mercury.[173]\r\n\r\n[173] Phil. Trans. 1733. No. 430, p. 145.\r\n\r\nBoerhaave combated the opinions of the iatro-chemists with great\r\neloquence, and with a weight derived from his high reputation, and\r\nthe extraordinary veneration in which his opinions were held by his\r\ndisciples. His efforts were assisted by those of Bohn, who combated\r\nthe medical opinions by arguments drawn both from experience and\r\nobservation, and perfectly irresistible; and the ruin of the chemical\r\nsect was consummated by the exertions of the celebrated Frederick\r\nHoffmann, the founder of the most perfect and satisfactory system of\r\nmedicine that has ever appeared. His efforts were probably roused into\r\naction by a visit which he paid to England in 1683, during which he\r\ngot acquainted with Boyle and with Sydenham; the former the greatest\r\nexperimentalist, and the latter the greatest physician of the time; and\r\nboth of whom were declared enemies to iatro-chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nOF AGRICOLA AND METALLURGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been induced by a wish to prosecute the history of the opinions\r\nfirst supported by Paracelsus, and carried so much further by Van\r\nHelmont and Sylvius, to give a connected view of their effects\r\nupon medical practice and medical theory; and I have come to the\r\ncommencement of the eighteenth century, without taking notice of one\r\nof the most extraordinary men, and one of the greatest promoters of\r\nchemistry that ever existed: I mean George Agricola. I shall consecrate\r\nthe whole of this chapter to his labours, and those of his immediate\r\nsuccessors.\r\n\r\nGeorge Agricola was born at Glaucha, in Misnia, in the year 1494.\r\nWhen a young man he acquired such a passion for mining and minerals,\r\nby frequenting the mountains of Bohemia, that he could not be\r\npersuaded to relinquish the study. He settled, indeed, as a physician,\r\nat Joachimstal; but his favourite study engrossed so much of his\r\nattention, that he succeeded but ill in his medical capacity. This\r\ninduced him to withdraw to Chemnitz, where he devoted himself to his\r\nfavourite pursuits. He studied the mineralogical writings of the\r\nancients with the most minute accuracy; but not satisfied with this, he\r\nvisited the mines in person, examined the processes followed by the\r\nminers in extracting the different ores, and in washing and sorting\r\nthem. He made collections of all the different ores, and studied their\r\nnature and properties attentively: he likewise collected information\r\nabout the methods of smelting them, and extracting from them the metals\r\nin a state of purity. The information which he collected, respecting\r\nthe mines wrought in the different countries of Europe, is quite\r\nwonderful, if we consider the period in which he lived, the little\r\nintercourse which existed between nations, and the total want of all\r\nthose newspapers and journals which now carry every new scientific fact\r\nwith such rapidity to every part of the world.\r\n\r\nAgricola died at Chemnitz in the year 1555, after he had reached\r\nthe sixty-first year of his age. Maurice, the celebrated Elector of\r\nSaxony, settled on him a pension, the whole of which he devoted to\r\nhis metallurgic pursuits. To him we find him dedicating the edition\r\nof his works which he published in the year of his death, and which\r\nis dated the fourteenth before the calends of April, 1555. He even\r\nspent a considerable proportion of his own estate in following out\r\nhis favourite investigations. In the earlier part of his life he had\r\nexpressed himself rather favourable to the protestant opinions; but in\r\nhis latter days he had attacked the reformed religion. This rendered\r\nhim so odious to the Lutherans, at that time predominant in Chemnitz,\r\nthat they suffered his body to remain unburied for five days together;\r\nso that it was necessary to remove it from Chemnitz to Zeitz, where it\r\nwas interred in the principal church.\r\n\r\nHis great work is his treatise De Re Metallica, in twelve books. In\r\nthis work he gives an account of the instruments and machines, and\r\nevery thing connected with mining and metallurgy; and even gives\r\nfigures of all the different pieces of apparatus employed in his\r\ntime. He has also exhibited the Latin and German names for all these\r\ndifferent utensils. This work may be considered as a very complete\r\ntreatise on metallurgy, as it existed in the sixteenth century. The\r\nfirst six books are occupied with an account of mining and smelting. In\r\nthe seventh book he treats of _docimasy_, or the method of determining\r\nthe quantity of metal which can be extracted from every particular\r\nore. This he does so completely, that most of his processes are still\r\nfollowed by miners and smelters. He gives a minute and accurate account\r\nof the furnaces, muffles, crucibles, &c., almost such as are still\r\nemployed, with minute directions for preparing the ores which are\r\nto be subjected to examination, the fluxes with which they must be\r\nmixed, and the precautions necessary in order to obtain a satisfactory\r\nresult. In short, this book may be considered as a complete manual of\r\ndocimasy. How much of the methods given originated with Agricola it\r\nis impossible to say. He probably did little more than collect the\r\nscattered processes employed by the smelters of metals, in different\r\nparts of the world, and reduce the whole to a regular system. But this\r\nwas a great deal. Perhaps it is not saying too much, that the great\r\nprogress made in the chemical investigation of the metals, was owing in\r\na great measure to the labours of Agricola. Certainly the progress made\r\nby the moderns, in the difficult arts of mining and metallurgy, must in\r\na great measure be ascribed to the labours of Agricola.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth book he describes the mechanical preparation of the ores,\r\nand the mode of roasting them, either in the open air or in furnaces.\r\nThe ninth book is occupied with an account of smelting-furnaces. It\r\ncontains also a description of the processes for obtaining mercury,\r\nantimony, and bismuth, from their ores. The tenth book treats of the\r\nseparation of silver and gold from each other, by means of nitric acid\r\nand aqua regia: minute directions for the preparation of which are\r\ngiven. The modes of purifying the precious metals by means of sulphur,\r\nantimony, and cementations, are also described. In the eleventh book\r\nhe treats of the method of purifying silver from copper and iron, by\r\nmeans of lead. He gives an account also of the processes employed for\r\nsmelting and purifying copper. In the twelfth book he treats of the\r\nmethods of preparing common salt, saltpetre, alum, and green vitriol,\r\nor sulphate of iron: of the preparation and purification of sulphur,\r\nand of the mode of manufacturing glass. In short, Agricola’s work De Re\r\nMetallica is beyond comparison the most valuable chemical work which\r\nthe sixteenth century produced, and places the author very high indeed\r\namong the list of the improvers of chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe other works of Agricola are his treatise De Natura Fossilium,\r\nin ten books; De Ortu et Causis Subterraneorum, in five books; De\r\nNatura eorum quæ effluunt ex Terra, in four books; De veteribus et\r\nnovis Metallis, in two books; and his Bermannus sive de re metallica\r\nDialogus. The treatise De veteribus et novis Metallis is amusing.\r\nHe not only collects together all the historical facts on record,\r\nrespecting the first discoverers of the different metals and the\r\nfirst workers of mines, but he gives many amusing anecdotes nowhere\r\nelse to be found, respecting the way in which some of the most\r\ncelebrated German mines were discovered. In the second book he takes\r\na geographical view of every part of the known world, and states\r\nthe mines wrought and the metals found in each. We must not suppose\r\nthat all his statements in this historical sketch are accurate: to\r\nadmit it would be to allow him a greater share of information than\r\ncould possibly belong to any one man. He frequently gives us the\r\nauthority upon which his statements are founded; but he often makes\r\nstatements without any authority whatever. Thus he says, that a mine of\r\nquicksilver had been recently discovered in Scotland: the fact however,\r\nis, that no quicksilver-mine ever existed in any part of Britain. There\r\nwas, indeed, a foolish story circulated about thirty years ago, about\r\na vein of quicksilver found under the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed; but\r\nit was an assertion unsupported by any authentic evidence.\r\n\r\nMany years elapsed before much addition was made to the processes\r\ndescribed by Agricola. In the year 1566, Pedro Fernandes de Velasco\r\nintroduced a method of extracting gold and silver from their ores\r\nin Mexico and Peru by means of quicksilver. But I have never seen\r\na description of his process. Alonzo Barba claims for himself, and\r\nseemingly with justice, the method of amalgamating the ores of gold\r\nand silver by boiling. Barba was a Spanish priest, who lived about the\r\nyear 1609, at Tarabuco, a market-town in the province of Charcso, eight\r\nmiles from Plata, in South America. In the year 1615 he was curate at\r\nTiaguacano, in the Province of Pacayes, and in 1617, he lived at Lepas\r\nin Peru. He is said to have been a native of Lepe, a small township\r\nin Andalusia, and had for many years the living of the church of St.\r\nBernard at Potosi. His work on the amalgamation of gold and silver\r\nores appeared at Madrid in the year 1640, in quarto.[174] In the year\r\n1629 a new edition of it appeared with an appendix, under the title of\r\n“Trattado de las Antiquas Minas de España de Alonzo Carillo Lasso.”\r\nThe English minister at the Court of Madrid, the Earl of Sandwich,\r\npublished the first part of it in an English translation at London,\r\nin 1674, under the title of “The First Book of the Art of Metals, in\r\nwhich is declared the manner of their generation, and the concomitants\r\nof them, written in Spanish by Albaro Alonzo Barba. By E. Earl of\r\nSandwich.”\r\n\r\n[174] It is entitled, “El Arte de los Metales, en que se ensena el\r\nverdadero beneficio de los de oro y plata por azoque,” &c.\r\n\r\nThe next improver of metallurgic processes was Lazarus Erckern,\r\nwho was upper bar-master at Kuttenberg, in the year 1588, and was\r\nsuperintendent of the mines in Germany, Hungary, Transylvania, the\r\nTyrol, &c., to three successive emperors. His work has been translated\r\ninto English under the title of “Heta Minor; or the laws of art and\r\nnature in knowing, judging, assaying, fining, refining, and enlarging\r\nthe bodies of confined metals. To which are added essays on metallic\r\nwords, illustrated with sculptures. By Sir J. Pettus. London, 1683,\r\nfolio.” But this translation is a very bad one. Erckern gives a plain\r\naccount of all the processes employed in his time without a word of\r\ntheory or reasoning. It is an excellent practical book; though it is\r\nobvious enough that the author was inferior in point of abilities to\r\nAgricola. His treatment of Don Juan de Corduba, who offered, in 1588,\r\nto put the Court of Vienna in possession of the Spanish method of\r\nextracting gold and silver from the ores by amalgamation, as related by\r\nBaron Born in his work on amalgamation, shows very clearly that Erckern\r\nwas a very illiberal-minded man, and puffed up with an undue conceit\r\nof his own superior knowledge.[175] Had he condescended to assist the\r\nSpaniard, and to furnish him with proper materials to work upon, the\r\nAustrians might have been in possession of the process of amalgamation\r\nwith all its advantages a couple of centuries before its actual\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\n[175] Born’s New Process of Amalgamation, translated by Raspe, p. 11.\r\n\r\nI need not take any notice of the docimastic treatises of Schindlers\r\nand Schlutter, which are of a much later date, and both of which have\r\nbeen translated into French, the former by Geoffroy, junior; the latter\r\nby Hellot. This last translation, in two large quartos, published in\r\n1764, constitutes a very valuable book, and exhibits all the docimastic\r\nand metallurgic processes known at that period with much fidelity\r\nand minuteness. Very great improvements have taken place since that\r\nperiod, but I am not aware of any work published in any of the European\r\nlanguages, that is calculated to give us an exact idea of the present\r\nstate of the various mining and metallurgic processes--important as\r\nthey are to civilized society.\r\n\r\nGellert’s Metallurgic Chemistry, so far as it goes, is an excellent\r\nbook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nOF GLAUBER, LEMERY, AND SOME OTHER CHEMISTS OF THE END OF THE\r\nSEVENTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto I have treated of the alchymists, or iatro-chemists, and\r\nhave brought the history of chemistry down to the beginning of the\r\neighteenth century. But during the seventeenth century there existed\r\nseveral laborious chemists, who contributed very materially by their\r\nexertions, either to extend the bounds of the science, or to increase\r\nits popularity and respectability in the eyes of the world. Of some of\r\nthe most eminent of these it is my intention to give an account in this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nOf John Rudolf Glauber, the first of these meritorious men in point of\r\ntime, I know very few particulars. He was a German and a medical man,\r\nand spent most of his time at Salzburg, Ritzingen, Frankfort on the\r\nMaine, and at Cologne. Towards the end of his life he went to Holland,\r\nbut during the greatest part of his residence in that country he was\r\nconfined to a sick-bed. He died at Amsterdam in 1668, after having\r\nreached a very advanced age. Like Paracelsus, whom he held in high\r\nestimation, he was in open hostility with the Galenical physicians of\r\nhis time. This led him into various controversies, and induced him\r\nto publish various apologies; most of which still remain among his\r\nwritings. One of the most curious of these apologies is the one against\r\nFarmer. To this man Glauber had communicated certain secrets of his\r\nown, which were at that time considered as of great value; Farrner\r\nbinding himself not to communicate them to any person. This obligation\r\nhe not only broke, but publicly deprecated the skill and integrity of\r\nGlauber, and offered to communicate to others, for stipulated sums,\r\na set of secrets of his own, which he vaunted of as particularly\r\nvaluable. Glauber examines these secrets, and shows that every one\r\nof them possessed of any value, had been communicated by himself to\r\nFarrner, and to put an end to Farrner’s unfair attempt to make money by\r\nselling Glauber’s secrets, he in this apology communicates the whole\r\nprocesses to the public.\r\n\r\nGlauber’s works were published in Amsterdam, partly in Latin, and\r\npartly in the German language. In the year 1689 an English translation\r\nof them was published in London by Mr. Christopher Packe, in one\r\nlarge folio volume. Glauber was an alchymist and a believer in the\r\nuniversal medicine. But he did not confine his researches to these\r\ntwo particulars, but endeavoured to improve medicine and the arts by\r\nthe application of chemical processes to them. In his treatise of\r\n_philosophical furnaces_ he does not confine himself to a description\r\nof the method of constructing furnaces, and explaining the use of\r\nthem, but gives an account of a vast many processes, and medicinal and\r\nchemical preparations, which he made by means of these furnaces. One of\r\nthe most important of these preparations was muriatic acid, which he\r\nobtained by distilling a mixture of common salt, sulphate of iron, and\r\nalum, in one of the furnaces which he describes.\r\n\r\nHe makes known the method of dissolving most of the metals in muriatic\r\nacid, and the resulting chlorides, which he denominates oils of the\r\nrespective metals, constitute in his opinion valuable medicines. He\r\nmentions particularly the chloride of gold, and from the mode of\r\npreparing it, the solution must have been strong. Yet he recommends it\r\nas an internal medicine, which he says may be taken with safety, and\r\nis a sovereign remedy in old ulcers of the mouth, tongue, and throat,\r\narising from the French pox, leprosy, scorbute, &c. Thus we see the use\r\nof gold as a remedy for the venereal disease did not originate with M.\r\nChretiens, of Montpelier. This chloride of gold is so violent a poison\r\nthat it is remarkable that Glauber does not specify the dose that\r\npatients labouring under the diseases for which he recommends it ought\r\nto take.--The sesqui-chloride of iron he recommends as a most excellent\r\napplication to ill-conditioned ulcers and cancers. We see from this\r\nthat the use of iron in cancers, lately recommended, is not so new a\r\nremedy as has been supposed.\r\n\r\nHe mentions the violent action of chloride of mercury (obviously\r\ncorrosive sublimate), and says that he saw a woman suddenly killed by\r\nit, being administered internally by a surgeon. Butter of antimony\r\nhe first recognised as nothing else than a combination of chlorine\r\nand antimony; before his time it had been always supposed to contain\r\nmercury.\r\n\r\nHe describes the method of obtaining sulphuric acid by distilling\r\nsulphate of iron; gives an account of the mode of obtaining sulphate\r\nof iron and sulphate of copper, in crystals: the method of obtaining\r\nnitric acid from nitre by means of alum, was much improved by him. He\r\ngives a particular detail of the way of obtaining fulminating gold.\r\nThis fulminating gold he says is of little use in medicine; but he\r\ngives a method of preparing from it a red tincture of gold, which he\r\nconsiders as one of the most useful and efficacious of all medicines:\r\nthis tincture is nothing else than chloride of gold. It would take up\r\ntoo much space to attempt an analysis of all the curious facts and\r\npreparations described in this treatise on philosophical furnaces;\r\nbut it will repay the perusal of any person who will take the trouble\r\nto look into it. All the different pharmacopœias of the seventeenth\r\ncentury borrowed from it largely. The third part of this treatise\r\nis peculiarly interesting. It will be seen that Glauber had already\r\nthought of the peculiar efficacy of applying solutions of sulphur,\r\n&c. to the skin, and had anticipated the various vapour and gaseous\r\nbaths which have been introduced in Vienna and other places, during\r\nthe course of the present century, and considered as new, and as\r\nconstituting an important era in the healing art. In the fourth part\r\nhe not only treats of the docimastic processes, so well described by\r\nAgricola and Erckern, but gives us the method of making glass, and\r\nof imitating the precious stones by means of coloured glasses. The\r\nfifth part is peculiarly valuable; in it he treats of the methods of\r\npreparing lutes for glass vessels, of the construction and qualities of\r\ncrucibles, and of the vitrification of earthen vessels.\r\n\r\nAnother of his tracts is called “The Mineral Work;” the object of which\r\nis to show the method of separating gold from flints, sand, clay,\r\nand other minerals, by the spirit of salt (_muriatic acid_), which\r\notherwise cannot be purged; also a panacea, or universal antimonial\r\nmedicine. This panacea was a solution of deutoxide of antimony in\r\npyrotartaric acid; Glauber gives a most flattering account of its\r\nefficacy in removing the most virulent diseases, particularly all kinds\r\nof cutaneous eruptions. The second and third parts of The Mineral Work\r\nare entirely alchymistical. In the treatise called “Miraculum Mundi,”\r\nhis chief object is to write a panegyric on _sulphate of soda_, of\r\nwhich he was the discoverer, and to which he gave the name of _sal\r\nmirabile_. The high terms in which he speaks of this innocent salt\r\nare highly amusing, and serve well to show the spirit of the age,\r\nand the dreams which still continued to haunt the most laborious and\r\nsober-minded chemists. The _sal mirabile_ was not merely a purgative,\r\na virtue which it certainly possesses in a high degree, being as mild\r\na purgative, perhaps the very best, of all the saline preparations\r\nyet tried; but it was a universal medicine, a panacea, a cure for all\r\ndiseases: nor was Glauber contented with this, but pointed out many\r\nuses in the various arts and manufactures for which in his opinion\r\nit was admirably fitted. But by far the fullest account of this _sal\r\nmirabile_ is given by him in his treatise on the nature of salts.\r\n\r\nI shall satisfy myself with giving the titles of his other tracts.\r\nEvery one of them contains facts of considerable importance, not to be\r\nfound in any chemical writings that preceded him; but to attempt to\r\nconnect these facts into one point of view would be needless, because\r\nthey are not such as would be likely to interest the general reader.\r\n\r\n1. The Consolation of Navigators. This gives an account of a method by\r\nwhich sailors may carry with them a great deal of nourishment in very\r\nsmall bulk. The method consists in evaporating the wort of malt to\r\ndryness, and carrying the dry extract to sea. This method has been had\r\nrecourse to in modern times, and has been found to furnish an effectual\r\nremedy against the scurvy. He recommends also the use of muriatic acid\r\nas a remedy for thirst, and a cure for the scurvy.\r\n\r\n2. A true and perfect Description of the extracting good Tartar from\r\nthe Lees of Wine.\r\n\r\n3. The first part of the Prosperity of Germany; in which is treated of\r\nthe concentration of wine, corn, and wood, and the more profitable use\r\nof them than has hitherto been.\r\n\r\n4. The second part of the Prosperity of Germany; wherein is shown by\r\nwhat means minerals may be concentrated by nitre, and turned into\r\nmetallic and better bodies.\r\n\r\n5. The third part of the Prosperity of Germany; in which is delivered\r\nthe way of most easily and plentifully extracting saltpetre out of\r\nvarious subjects, every where obvious and at hand. Together with a\r\nsuccinct explanation of Paracelsus’s prophecy; that is to say, in what\r\nmanner it is to be understood the northern lion will institute or plant\r\nhis political or civil monarchy; and that Paracelsus himself will not\r\nabide in his grave; and that a vast quantity of riches will offer\r\nitself. Likewise who the artist Elias is, of whose coming in the last\r\ndays, and his disclosing abundance of secrets, Paracelsus and others\r\nhave predicted.\r\n\r\n6. The fourth part of the Prosperity of Germany; in which are revealed\r\nmany excellent, useful secrets, and such as are serviceable to the\r\ncountry; and withal several preparations of efficacious cates extracted\r\nout of the metals and appointed to physical uses; as also various\r\nconfections of golden potions. To which is also adjoined a small\r\ntreatise which maketh mention of my laboratory; in which there shall be\r\ntaught and demonstrated (for the public good and benefit of mankind)\r\nwonderful secrets, and unto every body most profitable but hitherto\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\n7. The fifth part of the Prosperity of Germany; clearly and solidly\r\ndemonstrating and as it were showing with the fingers, what alchymy is,\r\nand what benefit may, by the help thereof, be gotten every where and in\r\nmost places of Germany. Written and published to the honour of God, the\r\ngiver of all good things, primarily; and to the honour of all the great\r\nones of the country; and for the health, profit, and assistance against\r\nforeign invasions, of all their inhabitants that are by due right and\r\nobedience subject unto them.\r\n\r\n8. The sixth and last part of the Prosperity of Germany; in which the\r\narcanas already revealed in the fifth part, are not only illustrated\r\nand with a clear elucidation, but also such are manifested as are most\r\nhighly necessary to be known for the defence of the country against\r\nthe Turks. Together with an evident demonstration adjoined, showing,\r\nthat both a particular and universal transmutation of the imperfect\r\nmetals into more perfect ones by salt and fire, is most true; and\r\nwithal, by what means any one, that is endued with but a mean knowledge\r\nin managing the fire, may experimentally try the truth hereof in\r\ntwenty-four hours’ space.\r\n\r\n9. The first century of Glauber’s wealthy Storehouse of\r\nTreasures.--Many of the processes given in this treatise are mystically\r\nstated, or even concealed.\r\n\r\n10. The second, third, fourth, and fifth century of Glauber’s wealthy\r\nStorehouse of Treasures.\r\n\r\n11. New chemical Light; being a revelation of a certain new invented\r\nsecret, never before manifested to the world.--This was a method of\r\nextracting gold from stones. Probably the gold found by Glauber in his\r\nprocesses existed in some of the reagents employed; this, at least, is\r\nthe most natural way of accounting for the result of Glauber’s trials.\r\n\r\n15. The spagyrical Pharmacopœia, or Dispensatory.--In this book he\r\ntreats chiefly of medicines peculiarly his own; one of those, on\r\nwhich he bestows the greatest praise, is _secret sal ammoniac_, or\r\nsulphate of ammonia. He describes the method of preparing this salt, by\r\nsaturating sulphuric acid with ammonia. He informs us that it was much\r\nemployed by Paracelsus and Van Helmont, who distinguished it by the\r\nname of _alkahest_.\r\n\r\n13. Book of Fires.--Full of enigmas.\r\n\r\n14. Treatise of the three Principles of Metals; viz. sulphur, mercury,\r\nand salt of philosophers; how they may be profitably used in medicine,\r\nalchymy, and other arts.\r\n\r\n15. A short Book of Dialogues. Chiefly relating to alchymy.\r\n\r\n16. Proserpine, or the Goddess of Riches.\r\n\r\n17. Of Elias the Artist.\r\n\r\n18. Of the three most noble Stones generated by three Fires.\r\n\r\n19. Of the Purgatory of Philosophers.\r\n\r\n20. Of the secret Fire of Philosophers.\r\n\r\n21. A Treatise concerning the Animal Stone.\r\n\r\nJohn Kunkel, who acquired a high reputation as a chemist, was born\r\nin the Duchy of Sleswick; in the year 1630: his father was a trading\r\nchemist, or apothecary; and Kunkel himself had, in his younger years,\r\npaid great attention to the business of an apothecary: he had also\r\ndiligently studied the different processes of glass-making; and had\r\npaid particular attention to the assaying of metals. In the year 1659,\r\nhe was chamberlain, chemist, and superintendent of apothecaries to the\r\ndukes Francis Charles and Julius Henry, of Lauenburg. While in this\r\nsituation, he examined many pretended transmutations of metals, and\r\nundertook other researches of importance. From this situation he was\r\ninvited, by John George II., Elector of Saxony, on the recommendation\r\nof Dr. Langelott and Counsellor Vogt, as chamberlain and superintendent\r\nof the elector’s laboratory, with a considerable salary. From this\r\nsituation he went to Berlin, where he was chemist to the elector\r\nFrederick William; after whose death, his laboratory and glass-house\r\nwere accidentally burnt. From Berlin he was invited to Stockholm by\r\nCharles XI., King of Sweden, who gave him the title of counsellor\r\nof metals, and raised him to the rank of a nobleman: here he died,\r\nin 1702, in the seventy-second year of his age. Kunkel’s greatest\r\ndiscovery was, the method of extracting phosphorus from urine. This\r\ncurious substance had been originally discovered by Brandt, a chemist,\r\nof Hamburg, in the year 1669, as he was attempting to extract from\r\nhuman urine a liquid capable of converting silver into gold. He showed\r\na specimen of it to Kunkel, with whom he was acquainted: Kunkel\r\nmentioned the fact as a piece of news to one Kraft, a friend of his in\r\nDresden, where he then resided: Kraft immediately repaired to Hamburg,\r\nand purchased the secret from Brandt for 200 rix-dollars, doubtless\r\nexacting from him, at the same time, a promise not to reveal it to\r\nany other person. Soon after, he exhibited the phosphorus publicly\r\nin Britain and in France; whether for money, or not, does not appear.\r\nKunkel, who had mentioned to his friend his intention of getting\r\npossession of the process, being vexed at the treacherous conduct of\r\nKraft, attempted to discover it himself, and, after three or four years\r\nlabour, he succeeded, though all that he knew from Brandt was, that\r\nurine was the substance from which the phosphorus was procured. In\r\nconsequence of this success, phosphorus was at first distinguished by\r\nthe epithet of _Kunkel_ added to the name.\r\n\r\nKunkel published, in 1678, a treatise on phosphorus, in which he\r\ndescribes the properties of this substance, at that time a subject of\r\ngreat wonder and curiosity. In this treatise, he proposes phosphorus\r\nas a remedy of some efficacy, and gives a formula for preparing pills\r\nof it, to be taken internally. It is therefore erroneous to suppose,\r\nas has been done, that the introduction of this dangerous remedy into\r\nmedicine is a modern discovery. Kunkel appears to have been acquainted\r\nwith nitric ether. One of the most valuable of his books, is his\r\ntreatise on glass-making, which was translated into French; and which,\r\ntill nearly the end of the eighteenth century, constituted by far the\r\nbest account of glass-making in existence. The following is a list of\r\nthe most important of his works:\r\n\r\n1. Observations on fixed and volatile Salts, potable Gold and Silver,\r\nSpiritus Mundi, &c.; also of the colour and smell of metals, minerals,\r\nand bitumens.--This tract was published at Hamburg, in 1678, and has\r\nbeen several times reprinted since.\r\n\r\n2. Chemical Remarks on the chemical Principles, acid, fixed and\r\nvolatile alkaline Salts, in the three kingdoms of nature, the mineral,\r\nvegetable, and animal; likewise concerning their colour and smell, &c.;\r\nwith a chemical appendix against non-entia chymica.\r\n\r\n3. Treatise of the Phosphorus mirabilis, and its wonderful shining\r\nPills; together with a discourse on what was formerly rightly named\r\nnitre, but is now called the _blood of nature_.\r\n\r\n4. An Epistle against Spirit of Wine without an acid.\r\n\r\n5. Touchstone de Acido et Urinoso, Sale calido et frigido.\r\n\r\n6. Ars Vitraria experimentalis.\r\n\r\n7. Collegium Physico-chymicum experimentale, _or_ Laboratorium\r\nchymicum.[176]\r\n\r\n[176] I have never seen a copy of this last work; it must have been\r\nvaluable, as it was the book from which Scheele derived the first\r\nrudiments of his knowledge.\r\n\r\nNicolas Lemery, the first Frenchman who completely stripped chemistry\r\nof its mysticism, and presented it to the world in all its native\r\nsimplicity, deserves our particular attention, in consequence of the\r\ncelebrity which he acquired, and the benefits which he conferred on\r\nthe science. He was born at Rouen on the 17th of November, 1645. His\r\nfather, Julian Lemery, was _procureur_ of the Parliament of Normandy,\r\nand a protestant. His son, when very young, showed a decided partiality\r\nfor chemistry, and repaired to an apothecary in Rouen, a relation of\r\nhis own, in hopes of being initiated into the science; but finding that\r\nlittle information could be procured from him, young Lemery left him in\r\n1666, and went to Paris, where he boarded himself with M. Glaser, at\r\nthat time demonstrator of chemistry at the Jardin du Roi.\r\n\r\nGlaser was a _true chemist_, according to the meaning at that time\r\naffixed to the term--full of obscure notions--unwilling to communicate\r\nwhat knowledge he possessed--and not at all sociable. In two months\r\nLemery quitted his house in disgust, and set out with a resolution to\r\ntravel through France, and pick up chemical information as he best\r\ncould, from those who were capable of giving him information on the\r\nsubject. He first went to Montpelier, where he boarded in the house\r\nof M. Vershant, an apothecary in that town. With his situation there\r\nhe was so much pleased, that he continued in it for three years:\r\nhe employed himself assiduously in the laboratory, and in teaching\r\nchemistry to a number of young students who boarded with his host.\r\nHere his reputation gradually increased so much, that he drew round\r\nhim the professors of the faculty of medicine of Montpelier, and all\r\nthe curious of the place, to witness his experiments. Here, too, he\r\npractised medicine with considerable success.\r\n\r\nAfter travelling through all France, he returned to Paris in 1672.\r\nHere he frequented the different scientific meetings at that time\r\nheld in that capital, and soon distinguished himself by his chemical\r\nknowledge. In a few years he got a laboratory of his own, commenced\r\napothecary, and began to give public lectures on chemistry, which were\r\nspeedily attended by great crowds of students from foreign countries.\r\nFor example, we are told that on one occasion forty Scotchmen repaired\r\nto Paris on purpose to hear his lectures, and those of M. Du Verney\r\non anatomy. The medicines which he prepared in his laboratory became\r\nfashionable, and brought him a great deal of money. The magistery\r\nof bismuth (or pearl-white), which he prepared as a cosmetic, was\r\nsufficient, we are told, to support the whole expense of his house. In\r\nthe year 1675 he published his Cours de Chimie, certainly one of the\r\nmost successful chemical books that ever appeared; it ran through a\r\nvast number of editions in a few years, and was translated into Latin,\r\nGerman, Spanish, and English.\r\n\r\nIn 1681 he began to be troubled in consequence of his religious\r\nopinions. Louis XIV. was at that time in the height of his glory,\r\nentirely under the control of his priests, and zealously bent upon\r\nputting an end to the reformed religion in his dominions. Indeed, from\r\nthe infamous conduct of Charles II. of England, and the bigotry of his\r\nsuccessor, a prospect was opened to him, and of which he was anxious to\r\navail himself, of annihilating the reformed religion altogether, and\r\nof plunging Europe a second time into the darkness of Roman Catholicism.\r\n\r\nLemery found it expedient, in 1683, to pass over into England.\r\nHere he was well received by Charles II.: but England was at that\r\ntime convulsed with those religious and political struggles, which\r\nterminated five years afterwards in the revolution. Lemery, in\r\nconsequence of this state of things, found it expedient to leave\r\nEngland, and return to France. He took a doctor’s degree at Caen,\r\nin Normandy; and, returning to Paris, he commenced all at once\r\npractitioner in medicine and surgery, apothecary, and lecturer on\r\nchemistry. The edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685, when James II. had\r\nassured Louis of his intention to overturn the established religion,\r\nand bring Great Britain again under the dominion of the pope. Lemery\r\nwas obliged to give up practice and conceal himself, in order to avoid\r\npersecution. Finding his success hopeless, as long as he continued\r\na protestant, he changed his religion in 1686, and declared himself\r\na Roman catholic. This step secured his fortune: he was now as much\r\ncaressed and protected by the court and the clergy, as he had been\r\nformerly persecuted by them. In 1699 when the Academy of Sciences was\r\nnew modelled, he was appointed associated chemist, and, on the death of\r\nBourdelin, before the end of that year, he became a pensioner. He died\r\non the 19th of June, 1715, at the age of seventy, in consequence of an\r\nattack of palsy, which terminated in apoplexy.\r\n\r\nBesides his System of Chemistry, which has been already mentioned, he\r\npublished the following works:\r\n\r\n1. Pharmacopée universelle, contenant toutes les Operations de\r\nPharmacie qui sont en usage dans la Médicine.\r\n\r\n2. Traité universelle des Drogues simples mis en ordre alphabétique.\r\n\r\n3. Traité de l’Antimoine, contenant l’analyse chimique de ce mineral.\r\n\r\nBesides these works, five different papers by Lemery were printed in\r\nthe Memoirs of the French Academy, between 1700 and 1709 inclusive.\r\nThese are as follow:\r\n\r\n1. Explication physique et chimique des Feux souterrains, des\r\ntremblemens de Terre, des Ouragans, des Eclairs et du Tonnere.--This\r\nexplanation is founded on the heat and combustion produced by the\r\nmutual action of iron filings and sulphur on each other, when mixed in\r\nlarge quantities.\r\n\r\n2. Du Camphre.\r\n\r\n3. Du Miel et de son analyse chimique.\r\n\r\n4. De l’Urine de Vache, de ses effets en médicine et de son analyse\r\nchimique.\r\n\r\n5. Reflexions et Experiences sur le Sublimé Corrosive.--It appears from\r\nthis paper, that in 1709, when Lemery wrote, corrosive sublimate was\r\nconsidered as a compound of mercury with the sulphuric and muriatic\r\nacids. Lemery’s statement, that he made corrosive sublimate simply\r\nby heating a mixture of mercury and decrepitated salt, is not easily\r\nexplained. Probably the salt which he had employed was impure. This is\r\nthe more likely, because, from his account of the matter which remained\r\nat the bottom of the matrass after sublimation, it must have either\r\ncontained peroxide of iron or peroxide of mercury, for its colour he\r\nsays was red.\r\n\r\nM. Lemery left a son, who was also a member of the French Academy; an\r\nactive chemist, and author of various papers, in which he endeavours to\r\ngive a mechanical explanation of chemical phenomena.\r\n\r\nAnother very active member of the French Academy, at the same time with\r\nLemery, was M. William Homberg, who was born on the 8th of January,\r\n1652, at Batavia, in the island of Java. His father, John Homberg, was\r\na Saxon gentleman, who had been stripped of all his property during\r\nthe thirty years war. After receiving some education by the care of a\r\nrelation, he went into the service of the Dutch East India Company, and\r\ngot the command of the arsenal at Batavia. There he married the widow\r\nof an officer, by whom he had four children, of whom William was the\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nHis father quitted the service of the India Company and repaired to\r\nAmsterdam with his family. Young Homberg studied with avidity: he\r\ndevoted himself to the law, and in 1674 was admitted advocate of\r\nMagdeburg; but his taste for natural history and science was great.\r\nHe collected plants in the neighbourhood, and made himself acquainted\r\nwith their names and uses. At night he studied the stars, and learned\r\nthe names and positions of the different constellations. Thus he\r\nbecame a self-taught botanist and astronomer. He constructed a hollow\r\ntransparent celestial globe, on which, by means of a light placed\r\nwithin, the principal fixed stars were seen in the same relative\r\npositions as in the heavens.\r\n\r\nOtto Guericke was at that time burgomaster of Magdeburg. His\r\nexperiments on a vacuum, and his invention of the air-pump, are\r\nuniversally known. Homberg attached himself to Otto Guericke, and\r\nthis philosopher, though fond of mystery, either explained to him\r\nhis secrets, in consequence of his admiration of his genius, or was\r\nunable to conceal them from his penetration. At last Homberg, quite\r\ntired of his profession of advocate, left Magdeburg and went to Italy.\r\nHe sojourned for some time at Padua, where he devoted himself to the\r\nstudy of medicine, anatomy, and botany. At Bologna he examined the\r\nfamous Bologna stone, the nature of which had been almost forgotten,\r\nand succeeded in making a pyrophorus out of it. At Rome he associated\r\nparticularly with Marc-Antony Celio, famous for the large glasses for\r\ntelescopes which he was able to grind. Nor did he neglect painting,\r\nsculpture, and music; pursuits in which, at that time, the Italians\r\nexcelled all other nations.\r\n\r\nFrom Italy he went to France, and thence passed into England, where he\r\nwrought for some time in the laboratory of Mr. Boyle, at that time one\r\nof the most eminent schools of science in Europe. He then passed into\r\nHolland, studied anatomy under De Graaf, and after visiting his family,\r\nwent to Wittemberg, where he took the degree of doctor of medicine.\r\n\r\nAfter this he visited Baldwin and Kunkel, to get more accurate\r\ninformation respecting the phosphorus which each had respectively\r\ndiscovered. He purchased a knowledge of Kunkel’s phosphorus, by giving\r\nin exchange a meteorological toy of Otto Guericke, now familiarly\r\nknown, by which the moisture or dryness of the air was indicated--a\r\nlittle man came out of his house and stood at the door in dry weather,\r\nbut retired under cover in moist weather. He next visited the mines\r\nof Saxony, Bohemia, and Hungary: he even went to Sweden, to visit the\r\ncopper-mines of that country. At Stockholm he wrought in the chemical\r\nlaboratory, lately established by the king, along with Hjerna, and\r\ncontributed considerably to the success of that new establishment.\r\n\r\nHe repaired a second time to France, where he spent some time,\r\nactively engaged with the men of science in Paris. His father strongly\r\npressed him to return to Holland and settle as a physician: he at\r\nlast consented, and the day of his departure was come, when, just as\r\nhe was going into his carriage, he was stopped by a message from M.\r\nColbert on the part of the king. Offers of so advantageous a nature\r\nwere made him if he would consent to remain in France, that, after some\r\nconsideration, he was induced to embrace them.\r\n\r\nIn 1682 he changed his religion and became Roman catholic: this\r\ninduced his father to disinherit him. In 1688 he went to Rome, where\r\nhe practised medicine with considerable success. A few years after\r\nhe returned to Paris, where his knowledge and discoveries gave him\r\na very high reputation. In 1691 he became a member of the Academy\r\nof Sciences, and got the direction of the laboratory belonging to\r\nthe academy: this enabled him to devote his undivided attention to\r\nchemical investigations. In 1702 he was taken into the service of the\r\nDuke of Orleans, who gave him a pension, and put him in possession of\r\nthe most splendid and complete laboratory that had ever been seen. He\r\nwas presented with the celebrated burning-glass of M. Tchirnhaus, by\r\nthe Duke of Orleans, and was enabled by means of it to determine many\r\npoints that had hitherto been only conjectural.\r\n\r\nIn 1704 he was made first physician to the Duke of Orleans, who\r\nhonoured him with his particular esteem. This appointment obliging him\r\nto reside out of Paris, would have made it necessary for him to resign\r\nhis seat in the academy, had not the king made a special exemption in\r\nhis favour. In 1708 he married a daughter of the famous M. Dodart, to\r\nwhom he had been long attached. Some years after he was attacked by a\r\ndysentery, which was cured, but returned from time to time. In 1715 it\r\nreturned with great violence, and Homberg died on the 24th of September.\r\n\r\nHis knowledge was uncommonly great in almost every department of\r\nscience. His chemical papers were very numerous; though there are few\r\nof them, in this advanced period of the science, that are likely to\r\nclaim much attention from the chemical world. His pyrophorus, of which\r\nhe has given a description in the Mémoires de l’Académie,[177] was made\r\nby mixing together human fæces and alum, and roasting the mixture till\r\nit was reduced to a dry powder. It was then exposed in a matrass to a\r\nred heat, till every thing combustible was driven off. Any combustible\r\nwill do as a substitute for human fæces--gum, flour, sugar, charcoal,\r\nmay be used. When a little of this phosphorus is poured upon paper, it\r\nspeedily catches fire and kindles the paper. Davy first explained the\r\nnature of this phosphorus. The potash of the alum is converted into\r\npotassium, which, by its absorption of oxygen from the atmosphere,\r\ngenerates heat, and sets fire to the charcoal contained in the powder.\r\n\r\n[177] For 1711, p. 238.\r\n\r\nHomberg’s papers printed in the Memoirs of the French Academy amount\r\nto thirty-one. They are to be found in the volumes for 1699 to 1714\r\ninclusive.\r\n\r\nM. Geoffroy, who was a member of the academy about the same time with\r\nLemery and Homberg, though he outlived them both, and who was an\r\nactive chemist for a considerable number of years, deserves also to be\r\nmentioned here.\r\n\r\nStephen Francis Geoffroy was born in Paris on the 13th of February,\r\n1672, where his father was an apothecary. While a young man, regular\r\nmeetings of the most eminent scientific men of Paris were held in his\r\nfather’s house, at which he was always present. This contributed very\r\nmuch to increase his taste for scientific pursuits. After this he\r\nstudied botany, chemistry, and anatomy in Paris. In 1692 his father\r\nsent him to Montpelier, to study pharmacy in the house of a skilful\r\napothecary, who at the same time sent his son to Paris, to acquire the\r\nsame art in the house of M. Geoffroy, senior. Here he attended the\r\ndifferent classes in the university, and his name began to be known as\r\na chemist. After spending some time in Montpelier, he travelled round\r\nthe coast to see the principal seaports, and was at St. Malo’s in 1693,\r\nwhen it was bombarded by the British fleet.\r\n\r\nIn 1698 Count Tallard being appointed ambassador extraordinary to\r\nLondon, made choice of M. Geoffroy as his physician, though he had\r\nnot taken a medical degree. Here he made many valuable acquaintances,\r\nand was elected a fellow of the Royal Society. From London he went to\r\nHolland, and thence into Italy, in 1700, where he went in the capacity\r\nof physician to M. de Louvois. The great object of M. Geoffroy was\r\nalways natural history, and materia medica. In 1693 he had subjected\r\nhimself to an examination, and he had been declared qualified to act\r\nas an apothecary; but his own object was to be a physician, while that\r\nof his father was that he should succeed himself as an apothecary:\r\nthis in some measure regulated his education. At last he declared\r\nhis intentions, and his father agreed to them; he became bachelor of\r\nmedicine in 1702, and doctor of medicine in 1704.\r\n\r\nIn 1709 he was made professor of medicine in the Royal College. In 1707\r\nhe began to lecture on chemistry, at the Jardin du Roi, in place of M.\r\nFagan, and continued to teach this important class during the remainder\r\nof his life. In 1726 he was chosen dean of the faculty of medicine;\r\nand, after the two years for which he was elected was finished, he was\r\nagain chosen to fill the same situation. There existed at that time a\r\nlawsuit between the physicians and surgeons in Paris; a kind of civil\r\nwar very injurious to both; and the mildness and suavity of his manners\r\nfitted him particularly for being at the head of the body of physicians\r\nduring its continuance. He became a member of the academy in 1699, and\r\ndied on the 6th of January, 1731.\r\n\r\nThe most important of all his chemical labours, and for which he\r\nwill always be remembered in the annals of the science, was the\r\ncontrivance which he fell upon, in 1718, of exhibiting the order of\r\nchemical decompositions under the form of a table.[178] This method\r\nwas afterwards much enlarged and improved. Such tables are now usually\r\nknown by the name of _tables of affinity_; and, though they have been\r\nof late years somewhat neglected, there can be but one opinion of their\r\nimportance when properly constructed.\r\n\r\n[178] Mem. Paris, 1718, p. 202; and 1720, p. 20.\r\n\r\nM. Geoffroy first communicated to the French chemists the mode of\r\nmaking Prussian blue, as Dr. Woodward did to the English.\r\n\r\nClaude Joseph Geoffroy, the younger brother of the preceding, was\r\nalso a member of the Academy of Sciences, and a zealous cultivator\r\nof chemistry. Many of his chemical papers are to be found in the\r\nmemoirs of the French Academy. He demonstrated the composition of sal\r\nammoniac, which however was known to Glauber. He made many experiments\r\nupon the combustion of the volatile oils, by pouring nitric acid on\r\nthem. He explained the pretended property which certain waters have\r\nof converting iron into copper, by showing that in such cases copper\r\nwas held in solution in the water by an acid, and that the iron merely\r\nprecipitated the copper, and was dissolved and combined with the acid\r\nin its place. He pointed out the constituents of the three vitriols,\r\nthe green, the blue, and the white; showing that the two former were\r\ncombinations of sulphuric acid with oxides of iron and copper, and the\r\nlatter a solution of lapis calaminaris (_carbonate of zinc_) in the\r\nsame acid. He has also a memoir on the emeticity of antimony, tartar\r\nemetic, and kermes mineral; but it is rather medical than chemical.\r\nHe determined experimentally the nature of the salt of Seignette, or\r\nRochelle salt, and showed that it was obtained by saturating cream of\r\ntartar with carbonate of soda, and crystallizing. It is curious that\r\nthis discovery was made about the same time by M. Boulduc. I have\r\nnoticed only a few of the papers of M. Geoffroy, junior; because,\r\nthough they all do him credit, and contributed to the improvement of\r\nchemistry, yet none of them contain any of those great discoveries,\r\nwhich stand as landmarks in the progress of science, and constitute an\r\nera in the history of mankind. For the same reason I omit several other\r\nnames that, in a more minute history of chemistry, would deserve to be\r\nparticularized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nOF THE ATTEMPTS TO ESTABLISH A THEORY IN CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBacon, Lord Verulam, as early as the commencement of the 17th century,\r\nhad pointed out the importance of chemical investigations, and had\r\npredicted the immense advantages which would result from the science,\r\nwhen it came to be properly cultivated and extended; but he did not\r\nhimself attempt either to construct a theory of chemistry, or even\r\nto extend it beyond the bounds which it had reached before he began\r\nto write. Neither did Boyle, notwithstanding the importance of his\r\ninvestigations, and his comparative freedom from the prejudices of the\r\nalchymists, attempt any thing like a theory of chemistry; though the\r\nobservations which he made in his Sceptical Chemist, had considerable\r\neffect in overturning, or at least in hastening the downfall of the\r\nabsurd chemical opinions which at that time prevailed, and the puerile\r\nhypotheses respecting the animal functions, and the pathology and\r\ntreatment of diseases founded on these opinions. The first person who\r\ncan with propriety be said to have attempted to construct a theory of\r\nchemistry, was Beccher.\r\n\r\nJohn Joachim Beccher, one of the most extraordinary men of the age in\r\nwhich he lived, was born at Spires, in Germany, in the year 1635. His\r\nfather, as Beccher himself informs us, was a very learned Lutheran\r\npreacher. As he lost his father when he was very young, and as that\r\npart of Germany where he lived had been ruined by the thirty years’\r\nwar, his family was reduced to great poverty. However, his passion\r\nfor information was so great, that he contrived to educate himself by\r\nstudying what books he could procure, and in this way acquired a great\r\ndeal of knowledge. Afterwards he travelled through the greatest part of\r\nGermany, Italy, Sweden, and Holland.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1666 he was appointed public professor of medicine in the\r\nUniversity of Mentz, and soon after chief physician to the elector.\r\nIn that capacity he took up his residence in Munich, where he was\r\nfurnished by the elector with an excellent laboratory: but he soon fell\r\ninto difficulties, the nature of which does not appear, and was obliged\r\nto leave the place. He took refuge in Vienna, where, from his knowledge\r\nof finance, he was appointed chamberlain to Count Zinzendorf, and\r\nthrough him acquired so much importance in the eyes of the court, that\r\nhe was named a member of the newly-erected College of Commerce, and\r\nobtained the title of imperial commercial counsellor and chamberlain.\r\nBut here also he speedily raised up so many enemies against himself,\r\nthat he found it necessary to leave Vienna, and to carry with him his\r\nwife and children. He repaired to Holland, and settled at Haerlem in\r\n1678. Here he was likely to have been successful; but his enemies from\r\nVienna followed him, and obliged him to leave Holland. In 1680 we\r\nfind him in Great Britain, where he examined the Scottish lead-mines,\r\nand smelting-works; and in 1681, and 1682, he traversed Cornwall, and\r\nstudied the mines and smelting-works of that great mining county; here\r\nhe suggested several improvements and ameliorations. Soon after this\r\nan advantageous proposal was made to him by the Duke of Mecklenburg\r\nGustrow, by means of Count Zinzendorf; but all his projects were\r\narrested by his death, which took place in the year 1682. It is said\r\nthat he died in London, but I have not been able to find any evidence\r\nof this.\r\n\r\nIt would be a difficult task to particularize his various discoveries,\r\nwhich are scattered through a multiplicity of writings. He was\r\nundoubtedly the first discoverer of boracic acid, though the credit of\r\nthe discovery has usually been given to Homberg.[179] But then he gives\r\nno account of boracic acid, nor does he seem to have attended to its\r\nqualities. The following is a list of Beccher’s writings:\r\n\r\n[179] In the sixth chemical thesis, in the second supplement to the\r\nPhysica Subterranea (page 791, Stahl’s Edition. Lipsiæ, 1703), he says,\r\n“ubi etiam, continuato igne, ipsum sal volatile acquires, quod eadem\r\nmethodo cum vitriolo seu spiritu aut oleo vitrioli, et oleo tartari,\r\nvel _borace_ succedit.”\r\n\r\n1.

Acta laboratorii Chymici Monacensis seu Physica Subterranea.--This,\r\nwhich is the most important of all his works, is usually known by the\r\nname of “Physica Subterranea.” This is the sole title affixed to it in\r\nthe edition published at Leipsic, in 1703, to which Stahl has prefixed\r\na long introduction. It is divided into seven sections. In the first he\r\ntreats of the creation of the world; in the second he gives a chemical\r\naccount of the motions and changes which are constantly going on in the\r\nearth; in the third he treats of the three principles of all bodies,\r\nwhich he calls _earths_. The first of these principles of metals and\r\nstones is the _fusible_ or _stony earth_; the second principle of\r\nminerals is the _fat earth_, improperly called _sulphur_; the third\r\nprinciple is the _fluid earth_, improperly called _mercury_; in the\r\nfourth section he treats of the action of subterraneous principles, or\r\nthe formation of _mixts_; in the fifth he treats of the solution of the\r\nthree classes of mixts, animals, vegetables, and metals; in the sixth\r\nhe treats of _mixts_, in which he gives their chemical constituents.\r\nThis section is very curious, because it gives Beccher’s views of the\r\nconstitution of compound bodies. It will be seen from it that he had\r\nmuch more correct notions of the real objects of chemistry, than any of\r\nhis contemporaries. In the seventh and last section he treats of the\r\naccidents and physical affections of subterraneous bodies.\r\n\r\n6.

Beccheri, Lancelotti, etc. Epistolæ quatuor Chemicæ.\r\n\r\nBeccher’s great merit was the contrivance of a chemical theory, by\r\nwhich all the known facts were connected together and deduced from one\r\ngeneral principle. But as this theory was adopted and considerably\r\nmodified by Stahl, it will be better to lay a sketch of it before the\r\nreader, after mentioning a few particulars of the life and labours of\r\none of the most extraordinary men whom Germany has produced; a man who,\r\nin spite of the moroseness and haughtiness of his character, and in\r\nspite of the barbarity of his style, raised himself to the very first\r\nrank as a man of science; and had the rare or almost unique fortune of\r\ngiving laws at the same time to two different and important sciences,\r\nwhich he cultivated together, without letting his opinions respecting\r\nthe one influence him with regard to the other. These sciences were\r\nchemistry and medicine.\r\n\r\nGeorge Ernest Stahl was born at Anspach, in the year 1660. He studied\r\nmedicine at Jena under George Wolfgang Wedel; and got his doctor’s\r\ndegree at the age of twenty-three. Immediately after this he began\r\nhis career as a public lecturer. In 1687 the Duke of Weimar gave him\r\nthe title of physician to the court. In 1694 he was named, at the\r\nsolicitation of Frederick Hoffmann, second professor of medicine in\r\nthe University of Halle, which had just been established. Hoffmann and\r\nhe were at that time great friends, though they afterwards quarrelled.\r\nBoth of them were men of the very highest talents and both were the\r\nfounders of medical systems which, of course, each was anxious to\r\nsupport. Hoffmann had greatly the superiority in elegance and clearness\r\nof style, and in all the amenities of polite manners. But perhaps the\r\nmoroseness of Stahl, and the obscurity, or rather mysticism of his\r\nstyle, contributed equally with the more amiable qualities of Hoffmann\r\nto excite the attention and produce the veneration with which he was\r\nviewed by his pupils, and, indeed, by the world at large.\r\n\r\nAt Halle he continued as a teacher of medicine for twenty-two years. In\r\n1716 he was appointed physician to the King of Prussia. In consequence\r\nof this appointment he left Halle, and resided in Berlin, where he died\r\nin the year 1734, in the seventy-fifth year of his age. Notwithstanding\r\nthe great figure that Stahl made as a chemist, there is no evidence\r\nthat he ever taught that science in any public school. The Berlin\r\nAcademy had been founded under the superintendence of Leibnitz, who was\r\nits first president; and therefore existed when Stahl was in Berlin:\r\nbut, till it was renovated in 1745 by Frederick the Great, this academy\r\npossessed but little activity, and could scarcely, therefore, have\r\nstimulated Stahl to attend to chemical science. However, his Chymia\r\nrationalis et experimentalis was published in 1720, while he resided\r\nin Berlin. The same date is appended to the preface of his Fundamenta\r\nChymiæ; but, from some expressions in that preface, it must, I should\r\nthink, have been written, not by Stahl, but by some other person.[180]\r\nI suspect that the book had been written by some of his pupils, from\r\nthe lectures of the author while at Halle. If this was really the\r\ncase, it is obvious that Stahl must have taught chemistry as well as\r\nmedicine in the University of Halle.\r\n\r\n[180] “Primus in his facem prætulit Beccherus; eumque magno cum artis\r\nprogressu sequentem videmus in ostendenda corporum analysi et synthesi\r\nchymica versatissimum et acutissimum--_Stahlium_.”\r\n\r\nStahl’s medical theory is not less deserving of notice than his\r\nchemical. But it is not the object of this work to enter into medical\r\nspeculations. Like Van Helmont, he resolved all diseases into the\r\nactions of the _soul_, which was not merely the former of the body, but\r\nits ruler and regulator. When any of the functions are deranged, the\r\nsoul exerts itself to restore them again to their healthy state; and\r\nshe accomplishes this by what in common language is called disease.\r\nThe business of a medical man, then, is not to prevent diseases, or to\r\nstop them short when they appear; because they are the efforts of the\r\nsoul, the _vis medicatrix naturæ_, to restore the deranged state of the\r\nfunctions: but he must watch these diseases, and prevent the symptoms\r\nfrom becoming too violent. He must assist nature to produce the\r\nintended effect, and check her exertions when they become abnormal. It\r\nwas a kind of modification of this theory, or rather a mixture of the\r\nStahlian and Hoffmannian theories, that Dr. Cullen afterwards taught\r\nin Edinburgh with so much eclat. And these opinions, so far as medical\r\ntheories have any influence on practice, still continue in some measure\r\nprevalent. Indeed, much of the vulgar practice followed by medical men,\r\nchiefly in consequence of the education which they have received, is\r\ndeduced from these two theories. But it would be too great a digression\r\nfrom the object of this work to enter into any details: suffice it\r\nto say, that the rival theories of Hoffmann and Stahl for many years\r\ndivided the medical world in Germany, if not in the greater part of\r\nEurope. It was no small matter of exultation to so young a medical\r\nschool as Halle, to have at once within its walls two such eminent\r\nteachers as Hoffmann and Stahl.\r\n\r\nLet us turn our attention to the chemical writings of Stahl. Of\r\nthese the most important is his Fundamenta Chymiæ dogmaticæ et\r\nexperimentalis. It is divided, like the chemistry of Boerhaave, into a\r\ntheoretical and practical part. The perusal of it is very disagreeable,\r\nas it is full of German words and phrases, and symbols are almost\r\nconstantly substituted for words, as was at that time the custom.\r\n\r\nHis definition of chemistry is much more exact than Boerhaave’s. It\r\nis, according to him, the art of resolving compound bodies into their\r\nconstituents, and of again forming them by uniting these constituents\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nHe is inclined to believe with Beccher, that the simple principles are\r\nfour in number. The _mixts_ are compounds of these principles; and he\r\nshows by the doctrine of permutations that if we suppose the simple\r\nprinciples four, then the number of mixts will be 40,340. He treats in\r\nthe first place of _mixts_, _compounds_, and _aggregates_.\r\n\r\nThe first object of chemistry is _corruption_, the second _generation_.\r\nOf these he treats at considerable length, giving an account of the\r\ndifferent chemical processes, and of the apparatus employed.\r\n\r\nHe next treats of _salts_, which he defines mixts composed of water\r\nand earth, both simple and pure, and intimately united. The salts are\r\nvitriol, alum, nitre, common salt, and sal ammoniac. He next treats of\r\nmore compound salts. These are sugar, tartar, salts from the animal and\r\nsalts from the mineral kingdom, and quicklime.\r\n\r\nAfter this comes sulphur, cinnabar, antimony, the sulphur of vitriol,\r\nthe sulphur of nitre, resins, and distilled oils. Then he treats of\r\nwater, which he divides into aqua _humida_ or common water, and aqua\r\n_sicca_ or mercury. Next he treats of earths, which are of two kinds,\r\nviz., _friable earths_, such as _clay_, _loam_, sand, &c., and metallic\r\nearths constituting the bases of the metals.\r\n\r\nHe next treats of the metals; and, as a preliminary, we have a\r\ndescription of the method of smelting, and operating upon the different\r\nmetals. The metals are then described successively in the following\r\norder: Gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, bismuth, zinc, antimony.\r\n\r\nTo this part of the system are added three sections. The first treats\r\nof mercuries, the second of the philosopher’s stone, and the third of\r\nthe universal medicine. We must not suppose that Stahl was a believer\r\nin these ideal compositions; his object is merely to give a history of\r\nthe different processes which had been recommended by the alchymists.\r\n\r\nThe second part of his work is divided into two _tracts_. The first\r\ntract contains three sections. The first of these treats of the nature\r\nof solids and fluids, of solutions and menstrua, of the effects of heat\r\nand fire, of effervescence and boiling, of volatilization, of fusion\r\nand liquefaction, of distillation, of precipitation, of calcination\r\nand incineration, of detonation, of amalgamation, of crystallization\r\nand inspissation, and of the fixity and firmness of bodies. In the\r\nsecond section we have an account of salts, and of their generation\r\nand transmutation, of sulphur and inflammability, of phosphorus, of\r\ncolours, and of the nature of metals and minerals. In this article\r\nhe gives short definitions of these bodies, and shows how they may\r\nbe known. The bodies thus defined are gold, silver, iron, copper,\r\nlead, tin, mercury, antimony, sulphur, arsenic, vitriol, common salt,\r\nnitre, alum, sal ammoniac, alkalies, and salts; viz., muriatic acid,\r\nsulphuric, nitric, and sulphurous.\r\n\r\nIn the third section he treats of the method of reducing metallic\r\ncalces, of the mode of separating metals from their scoriæ, of the mode\r\nof making artificial gems, and finally of the mode of giving copper a\r\ngolden colour.\r\n\r\nThe second tract is divided into two parts. The first part is\r\nsubdivided into four sections. In the first section he treats of the\r\ninstruments of chemical motion, of fire, of air, of water, of the most\r\nsubtile earth or salt. In the second section he treats _de subjectis_,\r\nunder the several heads of dissolving aggregates, of triturations and\r\nsolutions, and of calcinations and combustions. In the third section\r\nhe treats of the object of chemistry under the following heads: Of\r\nchemical corruption, consisting of compounds from liquids, of the\r\nseparation of solids and fluids, of mixts, of the solution of compounds\r\nfrom solids. In the fourth section he treats of fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe second part of this second tract treats of chemical generation,\r\nand is divided into two sections. In the first section he treats of\r\nthe aggregate collection of bodies into fluids and solids. The section\r\ntreats of compositions under the heads of volatile and solid bodies. He\r\ngives in the last article an account of the combination of mixts.\r\n\r\nThe third and last part of this elaborate work discusses three\r\nsubjects; viz. _zymotechnia_ or _fermentation_, _halotechnia_, or the\r\nproduction and properties of salts, and _pyrotechnia_, in which the\r\nwhole of the Stahlian doctrine of _phlogiston_ is developed. This\r\nthird part has all the appearance of having been notes written down by\r\nsome person during the lectures of Stahl: for it consists of alternate\r\nsentences of Latin and German. It is not at all likely that Stahl\r\nhimself would have produced such a piebald work; but if he lectured in\r\nLatin, as was at that time the universal custom, it was natural for a\r\nperson occupied in taking down the lectures, to write as far as was\r\npossible in Latin, but when any of the Latin phrases were lost, or did\r\nnot immediately occur to memory, it were equally natural to write down\r\nthe meaning of what the professor stated in the language most familiar\r\nto the writer, which was undoubtedly the German.\r\n\r\nAnother of Stahl’s works is entitled “Opusculum\r\nChymico-physico-medicum,” published at Halle in a thick quarto volume,\r\nin the year 1715. It contains a great number of tracts, partly chemical\r\nand partly medical, which it is needless to specify. Perhaps the most\r\ncurious of them all is his dissertation to show the way in which Moses\r\nground the golden calf to powder, dissolved it in water, and obliged\r\nthe children of Israel to drink it. He shows that a solution of hepar\r\nsulphuris (_sulphuret of potassium_), has the property of dissolving\r\ngold, and he draws as a conclusion from his experiments that this was\r\nthe artifice employed by Moses. We have in the same volume a pretty\r\ndetailed treatise on metallurgic pyrotechny and docimasy. This is the\r\nmore curious, because Stahl never appears to have frequented the mines\r\nand smelting-houses of Germany. He must, therefore, have drawn his\r\ninformation from books and from experiment.\r\n\r\nAnother of his books is entitled “Experimenta, Observationes,\r\nAnimadversiones, CCC. Numero.” An octavo volume, printed at Berlin\r\nin 1731. Another of his books is entitled “Specimen Beccherianum.”\r\nThere are also two chemical books of Stahl, which I have seen only in\r\na French translation, viz., _Traité de Soufre_ and _Traité de Sels_.\r\nThese are the only chemical writings of Stahl that I have seen. There\r\nare probably others; indeed I have seen the titles of several other\r\nchemical works ascribed to him. But as it is doubtful whether he really\r\nwrote them or not, I think it unnecessary to specify them here.\r\n\r\nStahl’s writings evince the great progress which chemistry had\r\nmade even since the time of Beccher. But it is difficult to say\r\nwhat particular new facts, which appear first in his writings were\r\ndiscovered by himself, and what by others. I shall not, therefore,\r\nattempt any enumeration of them. His reasoning is more subtile, and his\r\nviews much more extensive and profound than those of his predecessors.\r\nThe great improvement which he introduced into chemistry was the\r\nemployment of _phlogiston_, to explain the phenomena of combustion\r\nand calcination. This theory had been originally broached by Beccher,\r\nfrom whom Stahl evidently borrowed it, but he improved and simplified\r\nit so much that the whole credit of it was given to him. It was called\r\nthe Stahlian theory, and raised him to the highest rank among chemists.\r\nThe sole objects of chemists for thirty or forty years after his time\r\nwas to illucidate and extend his theory. It applied so happily to all\r\nthe known facts, and was supported by experiments, which appeared\r\nso decisive that nobody thought of calling it in question, or of\r\ninterrogating nature in any other way than he had pointed out. It will\r\nbe requisite, therefore, before proceeding further with this historical\r\nsketch, to lay the outlines of the phlogistic theory before the reader.\r\n\r\nIt was conceived by Beccher and Stahl that all _combustible_ bodies\r\nare compounds. One of the constituents they supposed to be dissipated\r\nduring the combustion, while the other constituent remained behind.\r\nNow when combustible bodies are subjected to combustion, some of them\r\nleave an acid behind them; while others leave a fixed powdery matter,\r\npossessing the properties of an _earth_, and called usually the _calx_\r\nof the combustible body. The metals are the substances which leave\r\na calx behind them when burnt, and sulphur and phosphorus leave an\r\nacid. With respect to those bodies that would not burn, chemists did\r\nnot speculate much at first; but afterwards they came to think that\r\nthey consisted of the fixed substance that remained after combustion.\r\nHence the conclusion was natural, that they had already undergone\r\ncombustion. Thus quicklime possessed properties very similar to the\r\ncalces of metals. It was natural, therefore, to consider it as a calx,\r\nand to believe that if the matter dissipated during combustion could be\r\nagain restored, lime would be converted into a substance similar to the\r\nmetals.\r\n\r\nCombustibility then, according to this view of the subject, depends\r\nupon a principle or material substance, existing in every combustible\r\nbody, and dissipated during the combustion. This substance was\r\nconsidered to be absolutely the same in all combustible bodies\r\nwhatever; hence the difference between combustible bodies proceeded\r\nfrom the other principle or number of principles with which this common\r\nsubstance is combined. In consequence of this identity Stahl invented\r\nthe term _phlogiston_, by which he denoted this common principle of\r\ncombustible bodies. Inflammation, with the several phenomena that\r\nattend it, depended on the gradual separation of this principle,\r\nwhich being once separated, what remained of the body could no\r\nlonger be an inflammable substance, but must be similar to the other\r\nkinds of matter. It was this opinion that combustibility is owing\r\nto the presence of phlogiston, and inflammation to its escape, that\r\nconstituted the peculiar theory of Beccher, and which was afterwards\r\nillustrated by Stahl with so much clearness, and experiments to prove\r\nits truth were advanced by him of so much force, that it came to be\r\ndistinguished by the name of the Stahlian theory.\r\n\r\nThe identity of phlogiston in all combustible bodies was founded upon\r\nobservations and experiments of so decisive a nature, that after the\r\nexistence of the principle itself was admitted, they could not fail\r\nto be satisfactory. When phosphorus is made to burn it gives out a\r\nstrong flame, much heat is evolved, and the phosphorus is dissipated\r\nin a white smoke: but if the combustion be conducted within a glass\r\nvessel of a proper shape, this white smoke will be deposited on the\r\ninside of the glass; it quickly absorbs moisture from the atmosphere,\r\nand runs into an acid liquid, known by the name of phosphoric acid.\r\nIf this liquid be put into a platinum crucible, and gradually heated\r\nto redness, the water is dissipated, and a substance remains which,\r\non cooling, congeals into a transparent colourless body like glass:\r\nthis is dry _phosphoric_ acid. If now we mix phosphoric acid with\r\na quantity of charcoal powder, and heat it sufficiently in a glass\r\nretort, taking care to exclude the external air, a _portion_ or the\r\n_whole_ of the charcoal will disappear, and phosphorus will be formed\r\npossessed of the same properties that it had before it was subjected\r\nto combustion. The conclusion deduced from this process appeared\r\nirresistible; the charcoal, or a portion of it, had combined with the\r\nphosphoric acid, and both together had constituted phosphorus.\r\n\r\nNow, in changing phosphoric acid into phosphorus, we may employ almost\r\nany kind of combustible substance that we please, provided it be\r\ncapable of bearing the requisite heat; they will all equally answer,\r\nand will all convert the acid into phosphorus. Instead of charcoal we\r\nmay take lamp-black, or sugar, or resin, or even several of the metals.\r\nHence it was concluded that all of these bodies contain a common\r\nprinciple which they communicate to the phosphoric acid; and since the\r\nnew body formed is in all cases identical, the principle communicated\r\nmust also be identical. Hence combustible bodies contain an identical\r\nprinciple, and this principle is phlogiston.\r\n\r\nSulphur by burning is converted into sulphuric acid; and if sulphuric\r\nacid be heated with charcoal, or phosphorus, or even sulphur, it is\r\nagain converted into sulphur. Several of the metals produce the same\r\neffect. The reasoning here was the same as with regard to phosphoric\r\nacid, and the conclusion was similar.\r\n\r\nWhen lead is kept nearly at a red heat in the open air for some time,\r\nbeing constantly stirred to expose new surfaces to the air, it is\r\nconverted into the beautiful pigment called _red lead_; this is a calx\r\nof lead. To restore this calx again to the state of metallic lead, we\r\nhave only to heat it in contact with almost any combustible matter\r\nwhatever. Pit-coal, peat, charcoal, sugar, flour, iron, zinc, &c.,\r\nall these bodies then must contain one common principle, which they\r\ncommunicate to red lead, and by so doing convert it into lead. This\r\ncommon principle is phlogiston.\r\n\r\nThese examples are sufficient to show the reader the way in which\r\nStahl proved the identity of phlogiston in all combustible bodies. And\r\nthe demonstration was considered as so complete that the opinion was\r\nadopted by every chemist without exception.\r\n\r\nWhen we inquire further, and endeavour to learn what qualities\r\nphlogiston was supposed to have in its separate state, we find this\r\npart of the subject very unsatisfactory, and the opinions very\r\nunsettled. Beccher and Stahl represented phlogiston as a dry substance,\r\nor of an earthy nature, the particles of which are exquisitely\r\nsubtile, and very much disposed to be agitated and set in motion with\r\ninconceivable velocity. This was called by Stahl _motus verticillaris_.\r\nWhen the particles of any body are agitated with this kind of motion,\r\nthe body exhibits the phenomena of heat or ignition, or inflammation,\r\naccording to the violence and rapidity of the motion.\r\n\r\nThis very crude opinion of the earthy nature of phlogiston, appears to\r\nhave been deduced from the insolubility of most combustible substances\r\nin water. If we except alcohol, and ether, and gums, very few of\r\nthem are capable of being dissolved in that liquid. Thus the metals,\r\nsulphur, phosphorus, oils, resins, bitumens, charcoal, &c., are well\r\nknown to be insoluble. Now, at the time that Beccher and Stahl lived,\r\ninsolubility in water was considered as a character peculiar to earthy\r\nbodies; and as those bodies which contain a great deal of phlogiston\r\nare insoluble in water, though the other constituents be very soluble\r\nin that liquid, it was natural enough to conclude that phlogiston\r\nitself was of an earthy nature.\r\n\r\nBut though the opinions of chemists about the nature and properties\r\nof phlogiston in a separate state were unsettled, no doubts were\r\nentertained respecting its existence, and respecting its identity in\r\nall combustible bodies. Its presence or its absence produced almost\r\nall the changes which bodies undergo. Hence chemistry and combustion\r\ncame to be in some measure identified, and a theory of combustion was\r\nconsidered as the same thing with a theory of chemistry.\r\n\r\nMetals were compounds of _calces_ and phlogiston. The different\r\nspecies of metals depend upon the different species of calx which each\r\ncontains; for there are as many _calces_ (each simple and peculiar) as\r\nthere are metals. These calces are capable of uniting with phlogiston\r\nin indefinite proportions. The calx united to a little phlogiston still\r\nretains its earthy appearance--a certain additional portion restores\r\nthe calx to the state of a metal. An enormous quantity of phlogiston\r\nwith which some calces, as calx of manganese, are capable of combining,\r\ndestroys the metallic appearance of the body, and renders it incapable\r\nof dissolving in acids.\r\n\r\nThe affinity between a metallic calx and phlogiston is strong; but the\r\nfacility of union is greatly promoted when the calx still retains a\r\nlittle phlogiston. If we drive off the whole phlogiston we can scarcely\r\nunite the calx with phlogiston again, or bring it back to the state of\r\na metal: hence the extreme difficulty of reducing the calx of zinc, and\r\neven the red calx of iron.\r\n\r\nThe various colours of bodies are owing to phlogiston, and these\r\ncolours vary with every alteration in the proportion of phlogiston\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIt was observed very early that when a metal was converted into a calx\r\nits weight was increased. But this, though known to Beecher and Stahl,\r\ndoes not seem to have had any effect on their opinions. Boyle, who does\r\nnot seem to have been aware of the phlogistic theory, though it had\r\nbeen broached before his death, relates an experiment on tin which he\r\nmade. He put a given weight of it into an open glass vessel, and kept\r\nit melted on the fire till a certain portion of it was converted into\r\na calx: it was now found to have increased considerably in weight. This\r\nexperiment he relates in order to prove the materiality of heat: in his\r\nopinion a certain quantity of heat had united to the tin and occasioned\r\nthe increase of weight. This opinion of Boyle was incompatible with\r\nthe Stahlian theory: for the tin had not only increased in weight, but\r\nhad been converted into a calx. It was therefore the opinion of Boyle\r\nthat calx of tin was a combination of _tin_ and _heat_. It could not\r\nconsequently be true that calx of tin was tin deprived of phlogiston.\r\n\r\nWhen this difficulty struck the phlogistians, which was not till long\r\nafter the time of Stahl, they endeavoured to evade it by assigning new\r\nproperties to phlogiston. According to them it is not only destitute\r\nof weight, but endowed with a principle of levity. In consequence of\r\nthis property, a body containing phlogiston is always lighter than it\r\nwould otherwise be, and it becomes heavier when the phlogiston makes\r\nits escape: hence the reason why calx of tin is heavier than the same\r\ntin in the metallic state. The increase of weight is not owing, as\r\nBoyle believed, to the fixation of heat in the tin, but to the escape\r\nof phlogiston from it.\r\n\r\nThose philosophic chemists, who thus refined upon the properties of\r\nphlogiston, did not perceive that by endowing it with a principle of\r\nlevity, they destroyed all the other characters which they had assigned\r\nto it. What is gravity? Is it not an attraction by means of which\r\nbodies are drawn towards each other, and remain united? And is there\r\nany reason for supposing that chemical attraction differs in its nature\r\nfrom the other kinds of attraction which matter possesses? If, then,\r\nphlogiston be destitute of gravity, it cannot possess any attraction\r\nfor other bodies; if it be endowed with a principle of levity, it must\r\nhave the property of repelling other bodies, for that is the only\r\nmeaning that can be attached to the term. But if phlogiston has the\r\nproperty of repelling all other substances, how comes it to be fixed\r\nin combustible bodies? It must be united to the calces or the acids,\r\nwhich constitute the other principle of these bodies; and it could not\r\nbe united, and remain united, unless a principle of attraction existed\r\nbetween it and these bases; that is to say, unless it possessed a\r\nprinciple the very opposite of levity.\r\n\r\nThus the fact, that calces are heavier than the metals from which they\r\nare formed, in reality overturned the whole doctrine of phlogiston;\r\nand the only reason why the doctrine continued to be admitted after\r\nthe fact was known is, that in these early days of chemistry, the\r\nbalance was scarcely ever employed in experimenting: hence alterations\r\nin weight were little attended to or entirely overlooked. We shall\r\nsee afterwards, that when Lavoisier introduced a more accurate mode\r\nof experimenting, and rendered it necessary to compare the original\r\nweights of the substances employed, with the weights of the products,\r\nhe made use of this very experiment of Boyle, and a similar one made\r\nwith mercury, to overturn the whole doctrine of phlogiston.\r\n\r\nThe phlogistic school being thus founded by Stahl, in Berlin, a race\r\nof chemists succeeded him in that capital, who contributed in no\r\nordinary degree to the improvement of the science. The most deservedly\r\ncelebrated of these were Neumann, Pott, Margraaf, and Eller.\r\n\r\nCaspar Neumann was born at Zullichau, in Germany, in 1682. He was\r\nearly received into favour by the King of Prussia, and travelled\r\nat the expense of that monarch into Holland, England, France, and\r\nItaly. During these travels he had an opportunity of making a\r\npersonal acquaintance with the most eminent men of science in all\r\nthe different countries which he visited. On his return home, in\r\n1724, he was appointed professor of chemistry in the Royal College of\r\nPhysic and Surgery at Berlin, where he delivered a course of lectures\r\nannually. During the remainder of his life he enjoyed the situation of\r\nsuperintendent of the Royal Laboratory, and apothecary to the King of\r\nPrussia. He died in 1737. He was a Fellow of the Royal Society, and\r\nseveral papers of his appeared in the Transactions of that learned\r\nbody. The following is a list of these papers, all of which were\r\nwritten in Latin:\r\n\r\n1. Disquisitio de camphora.\r\n\r\n2. De experimento probandi spiritum vini Gallici, per quam usitato, sed\r\nrevera falso et fallaci.\r\n\r\nSome merchants in Holland, England, Hamburg, and Dantzic, were in\r\npossession of what they considered an infallible test to distinguish\r\nFrench brandy from every other kind of spirit. It was a dusky yellowish\r\nliquid. When one or two drops of it were let fall into a glass of\r\nFrench brandy, a beautiful blue colour appeared at the bottom of\r\nthe glass, and when the brandy is stirred, the whole liquid becomes\r\nazure. But if the spirit tried be malt spirit, no such colour appears\r\nin the glass. Neumann ascertained that the test liquid was merely a\r\nsolution of sulphate of iron in water, and that the blue colour was\r\nthe consequence of the brandy having been kept in oak casks, and thus\r\nhaving dissolved a portion of tannin. Every spirit will exhibit the\r\nsame colour, if it has been kept in oak casks.\r\n\r\n3. De salibus alkalino-fixis.\r\n\r\n4. De camphora thymi.\r\n\r\n5. De ambragrysea.\r\n\r\nHis other papers, published in Germany, are the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Ephemerides.\r\n\r\n1. De oleo distillato formicorum æthereo.\r\n\r\n2. De albumine ovi succino simili.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Miscellania Berolinensia.\r\n\r\n1. Meditationes in binas observationes de aqua per putrefactionem\r\nrubra, vulgo pro tali in sanguinem versa habita.\r\n\r\n2. Succincta relatio exactis Pomeraniis de prodigio sanguinis in palude\r\nviso.\r\n\r\n3. De prodigio sanguinis ex Pomeranio nunciato.\r\n\r\n4. Disquisitio de camphora.\r\n\r\n5. De experimento probandi spiritum vini Gallicum.\r\n\r\n6. De spiritu urinoso caustico.\r\n\r\n7. Demonstratio syrupum violarum ad probanda liquida non sufficere.\r\n\r\n8. Examen correctionis olei raparum.\r\n\r\n9. De vi caustica et conversione salium alkalino-fixorum aëri\r\nexpositorum in salia neutra.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe published separately,\r\n\r\n1. De salibus alkalino-fixis et camphora.\r\n\r\n2. De succino, opio, caryophyllis aromaticis et castoreo.\r\n\r\n3. On saltpetre, sulphur, antimony, and iron.\r\n\r\n4. On tea, coffee, beer, and wine.\r\n\r\n5. Disquisitio de ambragrysea.\r\n\r\n6. On common salt, tartar, sal ammoniac and ants.\r\n\r\nAfter Neumann’s death, two copies of his chemical lectures were\r\npublished. The first consisting of notes taken by one of his pupils,\r\nintermixed with incoherent compilations from other authors, was printed\r\nat Berlin in 1740. The other was printed by the booksellers of the\r\nOrphan Hospital of Zullichau (the place of Neumann’s birth), and is\r\nsaid to have been taken from the original papers in the author’s\r\nhandwriting. Of this last an excellent translation, with many additions\r\nand corrections, was published by Dr. Lewis, in London, in the year\r\n1759; it was entitled, “The Chemical Works of Caspar Neumann, M.D.,\r\nProfessor of Chemistry at Berlin, F.R.S., &c. Abridged and methodized;\r\nwith large additions, containing the later discoveries and improvements\r\nmade in Chemistry, and the arts depending thereon. By William\r\nLewis, M.B., F.R.S. London, 1759.” This is an excellent book, and\r\ncontains many things that still retain their value, notwithstanding\r\nthe improvements which have been made since in every department of\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\nI have reason to believe that the laborious part of this translation\r\nand compilation was made by Mr. Chicholm, whom Dr. Lewis employed as\r\nhis assistant. Mr. Chicholm, when a young man, went to London from\r\nAberdeen, where he had studied at the university, and acquired a\r\ncompetent knowledge of Greek and Latin, but no means of supporting\r\nhimself. On his arrival in London, one of the first things that\r\nstruck his attention was a Greek book, placed open against the pane\r\nof a bookseller’s window. Chicholm went up to the window, at which\r\nhe continued standing till he had perused the whole Greek page thus\r\nexposed to his view. Dr. Lewis happened to be in the shop: he had\r\nbeen looking out for a young man whom he could employ to take charge\r\nof his laboratory, and manage his processes, and who should possess\r\nsufficient intelligence to read chemical works for him, and collect\r\nout of each whatever deserved to be known, either from its novelty\r\nor ingenuity. The appearance and manners of Chicholm struck him, and\r\nmade him think of him as a man likely to answer the purposes which he\r\nhad in view. He called him into the shop, and after some conversation\r\nwith him, took him home, and kept him all his life as his assistant\r\nand operator. Chicholm was a laborious and painstaking man, and by\r\ncontinually working in Lewis’s laboratory, soon acquired a competent\r\nknowledge of chemistry. He compiled several manuscript volumes, partly\r\nconsisting of his own experiments, and partly of collections from other\r\nauthors. At Dr. Lewis’s death, all his books were sold by auction, and\r\nthese manuscript volumes among the rest. They were purchased by Mr.\r\nWedgewood, senior, who at the same time took Mr. Chicholm into his\r\nservice, and gave him the charge of his own laboratory. It was Mr.\r\nChicholm that was the constructor of the well-known piece of apparatus\r\nknown by the name of Wedgewood’s pyrometer. After his death the\r\ninstrument continued still to be constructed for some time; but so many\r\ncomplaints were made of the unequal contraction of the pieces, that\r\nMr. Wedgewood, junior, who had succeeded to the pottery in consequence\r\nof the death of his father, put an end to the manufacture of them\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nJohn Henry Pott was born at Halberstadt, in the year 1692. He was a\r\nscholar of Hoffmann and Stahl, and from this last he seems to have\r\nimbibed his taste for chemistry. He settled at Berlin, where he became\r\nassessor of the Royal College of Medicine and Surgery, inspector of\r\nmedicines, superintendent of the Royal Laboratory, and dean of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences of Berlin. He was chosen professor of theoretical\r\nchemistry at Berlin; and on the death of Neumann, in 1737, he succeeded\r\nhim as professor of practical chemistry. He was beyond question the\r\nmost learned and laborious chemist of his day. His erudition, indeed,\r\nwas very great; and his historical introductions to his dissertation\r\ndisplays the extent of his reading on every subject of which he\r\nhad occasion to treat. It has often struck me that the historical\r\nintroductions which Bergmann has prefixed to his papers, are several\r\nof them borrowed from Pott. The Lithogeognosia of Pott is one of the\r\nmost extraordinary productions of the age in which he lived. It was the\r\nresult of a request of the King of Prussia, to discover the ingredients\r\nof which Saxon porcelain was made. Mr. Pott, not being able to procure\r\nany satisfactory information relative to the nature of the substances\r\nemployed at Dresden, resolved to undertake a chemical examination\r\nof all the substances that were likely to be employed in such a\r\nmanufacture. He tried the effect of fire upon all the stones, earths,\r\nand minerals, that he could procure, both separately and mixed together\r\nin various proportions. He made at least thirty thousand experiments\r\nin six years, and laid the foundation for a chemical knowledge of these\r\nbodies.[181] It is to this work of Pott that we are indebted for our\r\nknowledge of the effects of heat upon various earthy bodies, and upon\r\nmixtures of them. Thus he found that pure white clay, or mixtures of\r\npure clay and quartz-sand, would not fuse at any temperature which he\r\ncould produce; but clay, mixed with lime or with oxide of iron, enters\r\nspeedily into fusion. Clay also fuses with its own weight of borax; it\r\nforms a compact mass with half its weight, and does not concrete into\r\na hard body when mixed with a third of its weight of that salt. Clay\r\nfuses easily with fluor spar; it fuses, also, with twice its weight of\r\nprotoxide of lead, and with its own weight of sulphate of lime, but\r\nwith no other proportion tried. It was a knowledge of these mutual\r\nactions of bodies on each other, when exposed to heat, that gradually\r\nled to the methods of examining minerals by the blowpipe. These methods\r\nwere brought to the present state of perfection by Assessor Gahn, of\r\nFahlun, the result of whose labours has been published by Berzelius, in\r\nhis treatise on the blowpipe. Pott died in 1777, in the eighty-fifth\r\nyear of his age.\r\n\r\n[181] There is a French translation of this work, entitled\r\n“Litheognosie, ou Examen Chymique des Pierres et des Terres en\r\ngénéral, et du Talc de la Topaz, et de la Steatite en particulier;\r\navec une Dissertation sur le Feu et sur la Lumière.” Paris, 1753.\r\nWith a continuation, constituting a second volume, in which all the\r\nexperiments in the first volume are exhibited in the form of tables.\r\n\r\nHis different chemical works (his Lithogeognosia excepted) were\r\ncollected and translated into French by M. Demachy, in the year 1759,\r\nand published in four small octavo volumes. The chemical papers\r\ncontained in these volumes are thirty-two in number. Some of these\r\npapers cannot but appear somewhat extraordinary to a modern chemist:\r\nfor example, M. Duhamel had published in the memoirs of the French\r\nAcademy, in the year 1737, a set of experiments on common salt, from\r\nwhich he deduced that its basis was a fixed alkali, which possessed\r\nproperties different from those of potash, and which of course required\r\nto be distinguished by a peculiar name. It is sufficiently known that\r\nthe term _soda_ was afterwards applied to this alkali; by which name it\r\nis known at present. Pott, in a very elaborate and long dissertation\r\non the base of common salt, endeavours to refute these opinions\r\nof Duhamel. The subject was afterwards taken up by Margraaf, who\r\ndemonstrated, by decisive experiments, that the base of common salt is\r\n_soda_; and that soda differs essentially in its properties from potash.\r\n\r\nPott’s dissertation on _bismuth_ is of considerable value. He collects\r\nin it the statements and opinions of all preceding writers on this\r\nmetal, and describes its properties with considerable accuracy and\r\nminuteness. The same observations apply to his dissertation on zinc.\r\n\r\nJohn Theodore Eller, of Brockuser, was born on the 29th of November,\r\n1689, at Pletzkau, in the principality of Anhalt Bernburg. He was\r\nthe fourth son of Jobst Hermann Eller, a man of a respectable\r\nfamily, whose ancestors were proprietors of considerable estates in\r\nWestphalia and the Netherlands. Young Eller received the rudiments\r\nof his education in his father’s house, from which he went to the\r\nUniversity of Quedlinburg; and from thence to the University of Jena,\r\nin 1709. He was sent thither to study law; but his passion was for\r\nnatural philosophy, which led him to devote himself to the study of\r\nmedicine. From Jena he went to Halle, and finally to Leyden, attracted\r\nby the reputation of the older Albinus, of Professor Sengerd and the\r\ncelebrated Boerhaave, at that time in the height of his reputation.\r\nThe only practical anatomist then in Leyden, was M. Bidloo, an old man\r\nof eighty, and of course unfit for teaching. This induced Eller to\r\nrepair to Amsterdam, to study under Rau, and to inspect the anatomical\r\nmuseum of Ruysch. Bidloo soon dying, Rau was appointed his successor\r\nat Leyden, whither Eller followed him, and dissected under him till\r\nthe year 1716. After taking his degree at Leyden, Eller returned to\r\nGermany, and devoted a considerable time to the study and examination\r\nof the mines of Saxony and the Hartz, and of the metallurgic processes\r\nconnected with these mines. From these mines he repaired to France, and\r\nresumed his anatomical studies under Du Verney and Winslow. Chemistry\r\nalso attracted a good deal of his attention, and he frequented the\r\nlaboratories of Grosse, Lemery, Bolduc, and Homberg, at that time the\r\nmost eminent chemists in Paris.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris he repaired to London, where he formed an acquaintance with\r\nthe numerous medical men of eminence who at that time adorned this\r\ncapital. On returning to Germany in 1721, he was appointed physician\r\nto Prince Victor Frederick of Anhalt Bernburg. From Bernburg he\r\nwent to Magdeburg; and the King of Prussia called him to Berlin in\r\n1724, to teach anatomy in the great anatomic theatre which had been\r\njust erected. Soon after he was appointed physician to the king, a\r\ncounsellor and professor in the Royal Medico-Chirurgical College,\r\nwhich had been just founded in Berlin. He was also appointed dean of\r\nthe Superior College of Medicine, and physician to the army and to\r\nthe great Hospital of Frederick. In the year 1755 Frederick the Great\r\nmade him a privy-counsellor, which is the highest rank that a medical\r\nman can attain in Prussia. The same year he was made director of the\r\nRoyal Academy of Sciences of Berlin. He died in the year 1760, in the\r\nseventy-first year of his age. He was twice married, and his second\r\nwife survived him.\r\n\r\nMany chemical papers of Eller are to be found in the memoirs of the\r\nBerlin Academy. They were of sufficient importance, at the time when\r\nhe published them, to add considerably to his reputation, though not\r\nsufficiently so to induce me to give a catalogue of them here. I am\r\nnot aware of any chemical discovery for which we are indebted to him;\r\nbut have been induced to give this brief notice of him, because he is\r\nusually associated with Pott and Margraaf, making with them the three\r\ncelebrated chemists who adorned Berlin, during the splendid reign of\r\nFrederick the Great.\r\n\r\nAndrew Sigismund Margraaf was born in Berlin, in the year 1709, and\r\nacquired the first principles of chemistry from his father, who was\r\nan apothecary in that city. He afterwards studied under Neumann, and\r\ntravelling in quest of information to Frankfort, Strasburg, Halle, and\r\nFreyburg, he returned to Berlin enriched with all the knowledge of his\r\nfavourite science which at that time existed. In 1760, on the death\r\nof Eller, he was made director of the physical class of the Berlin\r\nAcademy of Sciences. He died in the year 1782, in the seventy-third\r\nyear of his age. He gradually acquired a brilliant reputation in\r\nconsequence of the numerous chemical papers which he successively\r\npublished, each of which usually contained a new chemical fact, of\r\nmore or less importance, deduced from a set of experiments generally\r\nsatisfactory and convincing. His papers have a greater resemblance\r\nto those of Scheele than of any other chemist to whom we can compare\r\nthem. He may be considered as in some measure the beginner of chemical\r\nanalysis; for, before his time, the chemical analysis of bodies had\r\nhardly been attempted. His methods, as might have been expected,\r\nwere not very perfect; nor did he attempt numerical results. His\r\nexperiments on phosphorus and on the method of extracting it from urine\r\nare valuable; they communicated the first accurate notions relative\r\nto this substance and to phosphoric acid. He first determined the\r\nproperties of the earth of alum, now known by the name of _alumina_;\r\nshowed that it differed from every other, and that it existed in clay,\r\nand gave to that substance its peculiar properties. He demonstrated\r\nthe peculiar nature of soda, the base of common salt, which Pott had\r\ncalled in question, and thus verified the conclusions of Duhamel. He\r\ngives an easy process for obtaining pure silver from the chloride of\r\nthat metal: his method is to dissolve the pure chloride of silver in a\r\nsolution of caustic ammonia, and to put into the liquid a sufficient\r\nquantity of pure mercury; the silver is speedily reduced and converted\r\ninto an amalgam, and when this amalgam is exposed to a red heat the\r\nmercury is driven off and pure silver remains. The usual method of\r\nreducing the chloride of silver is to heat it in a crucible with a\r\nsufficient quantity of carbonate of potash, a process which was first\r\nrecommended by Kunkel. But it is scarcely possible to prevent the loss\r\nof a portion of the silver when the chloride is reduced in this way.\r\nThe modern process is undoubtedly the simplest and the best, to reduce\r\nit by means of hydrogen. If a few pieces of zinc be put into the bottom\r\nof a beer-glass and some dilute sulphuric acid be poured over it an\r\neffervescence takes place, and hydrogen gas is disengaged. Chloride of\r\nsilver, placed above the zinc in the same glass, is speedily reduced by\r\nthis hydrogen and converted into metallic silver.\r\n\r\nMargraaf’s chemical papers, down to the time of publication, were\r\ncollected together, translated into French and published at Paris\r\nin the year 1762, in two very small octavo volumes, they consist of\r\ntwenty-six different papers: some of the most curious and important\r\nof which are those that have been just particularized. Several other\r\npapers written by him appeared in the memoirs of the Berlin Academy,\r\nafter this collection of his works was published, particularly “A\r\ndemonstration of the possibility of drawing fixed alkaline salts\r\nfrom tartar by means of acids, without employing the action of a\r\nviolent fire.” It was this paper, probably, that led Scheele, a few\r\nyears after, to his well-known method of obtaining tartaric acid, a\r\nmodification of which is still followed by manufacturers.\r\n\r\n“Observations concerning a remarkable volatilization of a portion of\r\na kind of stone known by the names of flosse, flusse, fluor spar, and\r\nlikewise by that of hesperos: which volatilization was effectuated by\r\nmeans of acids.” Pott had already shown the value of fluor spar as a\r\nflux. Three years after the appearance of Margraaf’s paper, Scheele\r\ndiscovered the nature of fluor spar, and first drew the attention of\r\nchemists to the peculiar properties of fluoric acid.\r\n\r\nIn France, in consequence chiefly of the regulations established in\r\nthe Academy of Sciences, in the year 1699, a race of chemists always\r\nexisted, whose specific object was to cultivate chemistry, and extend\r\nand improve it. The most eminent of these chemical labourers, after the\r\nStahlian theory was fully admitted in France till its credit began to\r\nbe shaken, were Reaumur, Hellot, Duhamel, Rouelle, and Macquer. Besides\r\nthese, who were the chief chemists in the academy, there were a few\r\nothers to whom we are indebted for chemical discoveries that deserve to\r\nbe recorded.\r\n\r\nRené Antoine Ferchault, Esq., Seigneur de Reaumur, certainly one of the\r\nmost extraordinary men of his age, was born at Rochelle, in 1683. He\r\nwent to the school of Rochelle, and afterwards studied philosophy under\r\nthe Jesuits at Poitiers. Hence he went to Bourges, to which one of his\r\nuncles, canon of the holy chapel in that city, had invited him. At this\r\ntime he was only seventeen years of age, yet his parents ventured to\r\nintrust a younger brother to his care, and this care he discharged\r\nwith all the fidelity and sagacity of a much older man. Here he devoted\r\nhimself to mathematics and physics, and he soon after went to Paris to\r\nimprove the happy talents which he had received from nature. He was\r\nfortunate enough to meet with a friend and relation in the president,\r\nHenault, equally devoted to study with himself, equally eager for\r\ninformation, and possessed of equal honour and integrity, and equally\r\npromising talents.\r\n\r\nHe came to Paris in 1703. In 1708 he was admitted into the Academy of\r\nSciences, in the situation of _élève_ of M. Varignon, vacant by the\r\npromotion of M. Saurin to the rank of associate.\r\n\r\nThe first papers of his which were inserted in the Memoirs of the\r\nAcademy were geometrical: he gave a general method of finding an\r\ninfinity of curves, described by the extremity of a straight line,\r\nthe other extremity of which, passing along the surface of a given\r\ncurve, is always obliged to pass through the same point. Next year he\r\ngave a geometrical work on Developes; but this was the last of his\r\nmathematical tracts. He was charged by the academy with the task of\r\ngiving a description of the arts, and his taste for natural history\r\nbegan to draw to that study the greatest part of his attention. His\r\nfirst work as a naturalist was his observations on the formation of\r\nshells. It was unknown whether shells increase by intussusception, like\r\nanimal bodies, or by the exterior and successive addition of new parts.\r\nBy a set of delicate observations he showed that shells are formed by\r\nthe addition of new parts, and that this was the cause of the variety\r\nof colour, shape, and size which they usually affect. His observations\r\non snails, with a view to the way in which their shells are formed,\r\nled him to the discovery of a singular insect, which not only lives on\r\nsnails, but in the inside of their bodies, from which it never stirs\r\ntill driven out by the snail.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year, he wrote his curious paper on the silk of\r\nspiders. The experiments of M. Bohn had shown that spiders could spin\r\na silk that might be usefully employed. But it remained to be seen\r\nwhether these creatures could be fed with profit, and in sufficiently\r\ngreat numbers to produce a sufficient quantity of silk to be of use.\r\nReaumur undertook this disagreeable task, and showed that spiders could\r\nnot be fed together without attacking and destroying one another.\r\n\r\nThe next research which he undertook, was to discover in what way\r\ncertain sea-animals are capable of attaching themselves to fixed\r\nbodies, and again disengaging themselves at pleasure. He discovered the\r\nvarious threads and pinnæ which some of them possess for this purpose,\r\nand the prodigious number of limbs by which the sea-star is enabled to\r\nattach itself to solid bodies. Other animals employ a kind of cement\r\nto glue themselves to those substances to which they are attached,\r\nwhile some fix themselves by forming a vacuum in the interval between\r\nthemselves and the solid substances to which they are attached.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that he found great quantities of the buccinum,\r\nwhich yielded the purple dye of the ancients, upon the coast of Poitou.\r\nHe observed, also, that the stones and little sandy ridges round which\r\nthe shellfish had collected were covered with a kind of oval grains,\r\nsome of which were white, and others of a yellowish colour, and having\r\ncollected and squeezed some of these upon the sleeve of his shirt, so\r\nas to wet it with the liquid which they contained, he was agreeably\r\nsurprised in about half an hour to find the wetted spot assume a\r\nbeautiful purple colour, which was not discharged by washing. He\r\ncollected a number of these grains, and carrying them to his apartment,\r\nbruised and squeezed different parcels of them upon bits of linen; but\r\nto his great surprise, after two or three hours, no colour appeared\r\non the wetted part; but, at the same time, two or three spots of the\r\nplaster at the window, on which drops of the liquid had fallen, had\r\nbecome purple; though the day was cloudy. On carrying the pieces\r\nof linen to the window, and leaving them there, they also acquired\r\na purple colour. It was the action of light, then, on the liquor,\r\nthat caused it to tinge the linen. He found, likewise, that when the\r\ncolouring matter was put into a phial, which filled it completely, it\r\nremained unchanged; but when the phial was not full, and was badly\r\ncorked, it acquired colour. From these facts it is evident, that the\r\npurple colour is owing to the joint action of the light and the oxygen\r\nof the atmosphere upon the liquor of the shellfish.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, likewise, he made experiments upon a subject which\r\nattracted the attention of mechanicians--to determine whether the\r\nstrength of a cord was greater, or less, or equal to the joint strength\r\nof all the fibres which compose it. The result of Reaumur’s experiments\r\nwas, that the strength of the cord is less than that of all the fibres\r\nof which it is composed. Hence it follows, that the less that a cord\r\ndiffers from an assemblage of straight fibres, the stronger it is.\r\nThis, at that time considered as a singular mechanical paradox, was\r\nafterwards elucidated by M. Duhamel.\r\n\r\nIt was a popular opinion of all the inhabitants of the sea-shore, that\r\nwhen the claws of crabs, lobsters, &c., are lost by any means, they are\r\ngradually replaced by others, and the animal in a short time becomes as\r\nperfect as at first. This opinion was ridiculed by men of science as\r\ninconsistent with all our notions of true philosophy. Reaumur subjected\r\nit to the test of experiment, by removing the claws of these animals,\r\nand keeping them alone for the requisite time in sea-water: new claws\r\nsoon sprang out, and perfectly replaced those that had been removed.\r\nThus the common opinion was verified,and the contemptuous smile of the\r\nhalf-learned man of science was shown to be the result of ignorance,\r\nnot of knowledge.\r\n\r\nReaumur was not so fortunate in his attempts to explain the nature of\r\nthe shock given by the torpedo; which we now know to be an electric\r\nshock produced by a peculiar apparatus within the animal. Reaumur\r\nendeavoured to prove, from dissection, that the shock was owing to the\r\nprodigious rapidity of the blow given by the animal in consequence of a\r\npeculiar structure of its muscles.\r\n\r\nThe turquoise was at that time, as it still is, considerably admired in\r\nconsequence of the beauty of its colour. Persia was the country from\r\nwhich this precious stone came, and it was at that time considered as\r\nthe only country in the universe where it occurred. Reaumur made a set\r\nof experiments on the subject and showed that the fossil bones found in\r\nLanguedoc, when exposed to a certain heat, assume the same beautiful\r\ngreen colour, and become turquoises equally beautiful with the Persian.\r\nIt is now known, that the true Persian turquoise, the _calamite_\r\nof mineralogists, is quite different from fossil bones coloured\r\nwith copper. So far, therefore, Reaumur deceived himself by these\r\nexperiments; but at that time chemical knowledge was too imperfect to\r\nenable him to subject Persian turquoise to an analysis, and determine\r\nits constitution.\r\n\r\nAbout the same period, he undertook an investigation of the nature\r\nof imitation pearls, which resemble the true pearls so closely, that\r\nit is very difficult, from appearances, to distinguish the true from\r\nthe false. He showed that the substance which gave the false pearls\r\ntheir colour and lustre, was taken from a small fish called by the\r\nFrench _able_, or _ablette_. He likewise undertook an investigation\r\nof the origin of true pearls, and showed that they were indebted for\r\ntheir production to a disease of the animal. It is now known, that\r\nthe introduction of any solid body, as a grain of sand, within the\r\nshell of the living pearl-shellfish, gives occasion to the formation\r\nof pearl. Linnæus boasted that he knew a method of forming artificial\r\npearls; and doubtless his process was merely introducing some solid\r\nparticle of matter into the living shell. Pearls consist of alternate\r\nlayers of carbonate of lime and animal membrane; and the colour and\r\nlustre to which they owe their value depends upon the thinness of the\r\nalternate coats.\r\n\r\nThe next paper of Reaumur was an account of the rivers in France\r\nwhose sand yielded gold-dust, and the method employed to extract the\r\ngold. This paper will well repay the labour of a perusal; it owes its\r\ninterest in a great measure to the way in which the facts are laid\r\nbefore the reader.\r\n\r\nHis paper on the prodigious bank of fossil shells at Touraine, from\r\nwhich the inhabitants draw manure in such quantities for their fields,\r\ndeserves attention in a geological point of view. But his paper on\r\nflints and stones is not so valuable; it consists in speculations,\r\nwhich, from the infant state of chemical analysis when he wrote, could\r\nnot be expected to lead to correct conclusions.\r\n\r\nI pass over many of the papers of this most indefatigable man, because\r\nthey are not connected with chemistry; but his history of insects\r\nconstitutes a charming book, and contains a prodigious number of facts\r\nof the most curious and important nature. This book alone, supposing\r\nReaumur had done nothing else, would have been sufficient to have\r\nimmortalized the author.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1722 he published his work on the _art of converting iron\r\ninto steel, and of softening cast-iron_. At that time no steel whatever\r\nwas made in France; the nation was supplied with that indispensable\r\narticle from foreign countries, chiefly from Germany. The object of\r\nReaumur’s book was to teach his countrymen the art of making steel,\r\nand, if possible, to explain the nature of the process by which iron\r\nis changed into steel. Reaumur concluded from his experiments, that\r\nsteel is iron impregnated with _sulphureous_ and _saline_ matters. The\r\nword _sulphureous_, as at that time used, was nearly synonymous with\r\nour present term _combustible_. The process which he found to answer,\r\nand which he recommends to be followed, was to mix together\r\n\r\n  4 parts of soot\r\n  2 parts of charcoal-powder\r\n  2 parts of wood-ashes\r\n  1½ parts of common salt.\r\n\r\nThe iron bars to be converted into steel were surrounded with this\r\nmixture, and kept red-hot till converted into steel. Reaumur’s notion\r\nof the difference between iron and steel was an approximation to\r\nthe truth. The saline matters which he added do not enter into the\r\ncomposition of steel; and if they did, so far from improving, they\r\nwould injure its qualities. But the charcoal and soot, which consist\r\nchiefly of carbon, really produce the desired effect; for steel is a\r\ncombination of _iron_ and _carbon_.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these experiments of Reaumur, it came to be an\r\nopinion entertained by chemists, that steel differed from iron merely\r\nby containing a greater proportion of phlogiston; for the charcoal\r\nand soot with which the iron bars were surrounded was considered as\r\nconsisting almost entirely of phlogiston; and the only useful purpose\r\nwhich they could serve, was supposed to be to furnish phlogiston. This\r\nopinion continued prevalent till it was overturned towards the end of\r\nthe last century, first by the experiments of Bergmann, and afterwards\r\nby those of Berthollet, Vandermond, and Monge, published in the Memoirs\r\nof the French Academy for 1786 (page 132). In this elaborate memoir the\r\nauthors take a view of all the different processes followed in bringing\r\niron from the ore to the state of steel: they then give an account of\r\nthe researches of Reaumur and of Bergmann; and lastly relate their own\r\nexperiments, from which they finally draw, as a conclusion, that steel\r\nis a compound of iron and carbon.\r\n\r\nThe regent Orleans, who at that time administered the affairs of\r\nFrance, thought that this work of Reaumur was deserving a reward, and\r\naccordingly offered him a pension of 12,000 livres. Reaumur requested\r\nof the regent that this pension should be given in the name of the\r\nacademy, and that after his death it should continue, and be devoted to\r\ndefray the necessary expenses towards bringing the arts into a state of\r\nperfection. The request was granted, and the letters patent made out on\r\nthe 22d of December, 1722.\r\n\r\nAt that time tin-plate, as well as steel, was not made in France;\r\nbut all the tin-plates wanted were brought from Germany, where the\r\nprocesses followed were kept profoundly secret. Reaumur undertook to\r\ndiscover a method of tinning iron sufficiently cheap to admit the\r\narticle to be manufactured in France--and he succeeded. The difficulty\r\nconsisted in removing the scales with which the iron plates, as\r\nprepared, were always covered. These scales consist of a vitrified\r\noxide of iron, to which the tin will not unite. Reaumur found, that\r\nwhen these plates are steeped in water acidulated by means of bran,\r\nand then allowed to rust in stoves, the scales become loose, and are\r\neasily detached by rubbing the plates with sand. If after being thus\r\ncleansed they are plunged into melted tin, covered with a little tallow\r\nto prevent oxidizement, they are easily tinned. In consequence of this\r\nexplanation of the process by Reaumur, tin-plate manufactories were\r\nspeedily established in different parts of France. It was about the\r\nsame time, or only a little before it, that tin-plate manufactories\r\nwere first started in England. The English tin-plate was much more\r\nbeautiful than the German, and therefore immediately preferred to it;\r\nbecause in Germany the iron was converted into plates by hammering,\r\nwhereas in England it was rolled out. This made it much smoother, and\r\nconsequently more beautiful.\r\n\r\nAnother art, at that time unknown in France, and indeed in every part\r\nof Europe except Saxony, was the art of making porcelain, a name given\r\nto the beautiful translucent stoneware which is brought from China and\r\nJapan. Reaumur undertook to discover the process employed in making\r\nit. He procured specimens of porcelain from China and Japan, and also\r\nof the imitations of those vessels at that time made in various parts\r\nof France and other European countries. The true porcelain remained\r\nunaltered, though exposed to the most violent heat which he was capable\r\nof producing; but the imitations, in a furnace heated by no means\r\nviolently, melted into a perfect glass. Hence he concluded, that the\r\nimitation-porcelains were merely glass, not heated sufficiently to be\r\nbrought into fusion; but true porcelain he conceived to be composed\r\nof two different ingredients, one of which is capable of resisting\r\nthe most violent heat which can be raised, but the other, when heated\r\nsufficiently, melts into a glass. It is this last ingredient that gives\r\nporcelain its translucency, while the other makes it refractory in\r\nthe fire. This opinion of Reaumur was soon after confirmed by Father\r\nd’Entrecolles, a French missionary in China, who sent some time after\r\na memoir to the academy, describing the mode followed by the Chinese\r\nin the manufactory of their porcelain. Two substances are employed\r\nby them, the one called _kaolin_ and the other _petunse_. It is now\r\nknown that _kaolin_ is what we call porcelain-clay, and that _petunse_\r\nis a fine white felspar. Felspar is fusible in a violent heat, but\r\nporcelain-clay is refractory in the highest temperatures that we have\r\nit in our power to produce in furnaces.\r\n\r\nReaumur made another curious observation on glass, which has been,\r\nsince his time, employed very successfully to explain the appearances\r\nof many of our trap-rocks. If a glass vessel, properly secured in\r\nsand, be raised to a red heat, and then allowed to cool very slowly,\r\nit puts off the appearance of glass and assumes that of stoneware, or\r\nporcelain. Vessels thus altered have received the name of _Reaumur’s\r\nporcelain_. They are much more refractory than glass, and therefore\r\nmay be exposed to a pretty strong red heat without any danger of\r\nsoftening or losing their shape. This change is occasioned by the\r\nglass being kept long in a soft state: the various substances of\r\nwhich it is composed are at liberty to exercise their affinities\r\nand to crystallize. This makes the vessel lose its glassy structure\r\naltogether. In like manner it was found by Sir James Hall and Mr.\r\nGregory Watt, that when common greenstone was heated sufficiently,\r\nand then rapidly cooled, it melted and concreted into a glass; but if\r\nafter having been melted it was allowed to cool exceedingly slowly, the\r\nconstituents again crystallized and arranged themselves as at first--so\r\nthat a true greenstone was again formed. In the same way lavas from a\r\nvolcano either assume the appearance of slag or of stone, according as\r\nthey have cooled rapidly or slowly. Many of the lavas from Vesuvius\r\ncannot be distinguished from our _greenstones_.\r\n\r\nReaumur’s labours upon the thermometer must not be omitted here;\r\nbecause he gave his name to a thermometer, which was long used in\r\nFrance and in other parts of Europe. The first person that brought\r\nthermometers into a state capable of being compared with each other\r\nwas Sir Isaac Newton, in a paper published in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions for 1701. Fahrenheit, of Amsterdam, was the first person\r\nthat put Newton’s method in practice, by fixing two points on his\r\nscale, the freezing-water point and the boiling-water point, and\r\ndividing the interval between them into one hundred and eighty degrees.\r\n\r\nBut no fixed point existed in the thermometers employed in France,\r\nevery one graduating them according to his fancy; so that no two\r\nthermometers could be compared together. Reaumur graduated his\r\nthermometers by plunging them into freezing water or a mixture of\r\nsnow and water. This point was marked zero, and was called the\r\nfreezing-water point. The liquid used in his thermometers was spirit\r\nof wine: he took care that it should be always of the same strength,\r\nand the interval between the point of freezing and boiling water\r\nwas divided into eighty degrees. Deluc afterwards rectified this\r\nthermometer, by substituting mercury for spirit of wine. This not only\r\nenabled the thermometer to be used to measure higher temperatures,\r\nbut corrected an obvious error which existed in all the thermometers\r\nconstructed upon Reaumur’s principle: for spirit of wine cannot bear\r\na temperature of eighty degrees Reaumur without being dissipated\r\ninto vapour--absolute alcohol boiling at a hundred and sixty-two\r\ndegrees two-thirds. It is obvious from this, that the boiling point in\r\nReaumur’s thermometer could not be accurate, and that it would vary,\r\naccording to the quantity of empty space left above the alcohol.\r\n\r\nFinally, he contrived a method of hatching chickens by means of\r\nartificial heat, as is practised in Egypt.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to him also for a set of important observations on the\r\norgans of digestion in birds. He showed, that in birds of prey, which\r\nlive wholly upon animal food, digestion is performed by solvents in\r\nthe stomach, as is the case with digestion in man: while those birds\r\nthat live upon vegetable food have a very powerful stomach or gizzard,\r\ncapable of triturating the seeds which they swallow. To facilitate this\r\ntriturating process, these fowls are in the habit of swallowing small\r\npebbles.\r\n\r\nThe moral qualities of M. Reaumur seem not to have been inferior to the\r\nextent and variety of his acquirements. He was kind and benevolent, and\r\nremarkably disinterested. He performed the duties of intendant of the\r\norder of St. Louis from the year 1735 till his death, without accepting\r\nany of the emoluments of the office, all of which were most religiously\r\ngiven to the person to whom they belonged, had she been capable of\r\nperforming the duties of the place. M. Reaumur died on the 17th of\r\nOctober, 1756, after having lived very nearly seventy-five years.\r\n\r\nJohn Hellot was born in Paris in the year 1685, on the 20th of\r\nNovember. His father, Michael Hellot, was of a respectable family, and\r\nthe early part of his son’s education was at home: it seems to have\r\nbeen excellent, as young Hellot acquired the difficult art of writing\r\non all manner of subjects in a precise, clear, and elegant style. His\r\nfather intended him for the church; but his own taste led him decidedly\r\nto the study of chemistry. He had an uncle a physician, some of whose\r\npapers on chemical subjects fell into his hands. This circumstance\r\nkindled his natural taste into a flame: he formed an acquaintance with\r\nM. Geoffroy, whose reputation as a chemist was at that time high, and\r\nthis friendship was afterwards cemented by Geoffroy marrying the niece\r\nof M. Hellot.\r\n\r\nHis circumstances being easy, he went over to England, to form a\r\npersonal acquaintance with the many eminent philosophers who at that\r\ntime adorned that country. His fortune was considerably deranged by\r\nLaw’s celebrated scheme during the regency of the Duke of Orleans. This\r\nobliged him to look out for some resource: he became editor of the\r\nGazette de France, and continued in this employment from 1718 to 1732.\r\nDuring these fourteen years, however, he did not neglect chemistry,\r\nthough his progress was not so rapid as it would have been, could he\r\nhave devoted to that science his undivided attention. In 1732 he was\r\nput forward by his friends as a candidate for a place in the Academy of\r\nSciences; and in the year 1735 he was chosen adjunct chemist, vacant by\r\nthe promotion of M. de la Condamine to the place of associate. Three\r\nyears after he was declared a supernumerary pensioner, without passing\r\nthrough the step of associate. His reputation as a chemist was already\r\nconsiderable, and after he became a member of the academy, he devoted\r\nhimself to the investigations connected with his favourite science.\r\n\r\nHis first labours were on zinc; in two successive papers he endeavoured\r\nto decompose this metal, and to ascertain the nature of its\r\nconstituents. Though his labour was unsuccessful, yet he pointed out\r\nmany new properties of this metal, and various new compounds into which\r\nit enters. Neither was he more successful in his attempt to account for\r\nthe origin of the red vapours which are exhaled from nitre in certain\r\ncircumstances. He ascribed them to the presence of ferruginous matters\r\nin the nitre; whereas they are owing to the expulsion and partial\r\ndecomposition of the nitric acid of the nitre, in consequence of the\r\naction of some more powerful acid.\r\n\r\nHis paper on sympathetic ink is of more importance. A German chemist\r\nhad shown him a saline solution of a red colour which became blue when\r\nheated: this led him to form a sympathetic ink, which was pale red,\r\nwhile the paper was moist, but became blue upon drying it by holding it\r\nto the fire. This sympathetic ink was a solution of cobalt in muriatic\r\nacid. It does not appear from Hellot’s paper that he was exactly aware\r\nof the chemical constitution of the liquid which constituted his\r\nsympathetic ink; though it is clear he knew that cobalt constitutes an\r\nessential part of it.\r\n\r\nKunkel’s phosphorus, though it had been originally discovered in\r\nGermany, could not be prepared by any of the processes which had been\r\ngiven to the public. Boyle had taught his operator, Godfrey Hankwitz,\r\nthe method of making it. This man had, after Boyle’s death, opened a\r\nchemist’s shop in London, and it was he that supplied all Europe with\r\nthis curious article: on that account it was usually distinguished\r\nby the name of _English phosphorus_. But in the year 1737 a stranger\r\nappeared in Paris, who offered for a stipulated reward to communicate\r\nthe method of manufacturing this substance to the Academy of Sciences.\r\nThe offer was accepted by the French government, and a committee of\r\nthe academy, at the head of which was Hellot, was appointed to witness\r\nthe process, and ascertain all its steps. The process was repeated\r\nwith success; and Hellot drew up a minute detail of the whole, which\r\nwas inserted in the Memoirs of the Academy, for the year 1737. The\r\npublication of this paper constitutes an era in the preparation of\r\nphosphorus: it was henceforward in the power of every chemist to\r\nprepare it for himself. A few years after the process was much improved\r\nby Margraaf; and, within little more than twenty years after, the very\r\nconvenient process still in use was suggested by Scheele. Hellot’s\r\nexperiments on the comparative merits of the salts of Peyrac, and of\r\nPecais were of importance, because they decided a dispute--they may\r\nalso perhaps be considered as curiosities in an historical point of\r\nview; because we see from them the methods which Hellot had recourse to\r\nat that early period in order to determine the purity of common salt.\r\nThey are not entitled, however, to a more particular notice here.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1740 M. Hellot was charged with the general inspection of\r\ndyeing; a situation which M. du Foy had held till the time of his death\r\nin 1739. It was this appointment, doubtless, which turned his attention\r\nto the theory of dyeing, which he tried to explain in two memoirs read\r\nto the academy in 1740 and 1741. The subject was afterwards prosecuted\r\nby him in subsequent memoirs which were published by the academy.\r\n\r\nIn 1745 he was named to go to Lyons in order to examine with care the\r\nprocesses followed for refining gold and silver. Before his return\r\nhe took care to give to these processes the requisite precision and\r\nexactness. Immediately after his return to Paris he was appointed to\r\nexamine the different mines and assay the different ores in France;\r\nthis appointment led him to turn his thoughts to the subject. The\r\nresult of this was the publication of an excellent work on assaying\r\nand metallurgy, entitled “De la Fonte des Mines, des Fonderies, &c.\r\nTraduit de l’Allemand de Christophe-André Schlutter.” The first volume\r\nof this book appeared in 1750, and the second in 1753. Though this book\r\nis called by Hellot a translation, it contains in fact a great deal\r\nof original matter; the arrangement is quite altered; many processes\r\nnot noticed by Schlutter are given, and many essential articles are\r\nintroduced, which had been totally omitted in the original work. He\r\nbegins with an introduction, in which he gives a short sketch of all\r\nthe mines existing in every part of France, together with some notice\r\nof the present state of each. The first volume treats entirely of\r\ndocimasy, or the art of assaying the different metallic ores. Though\r\nthis art has been much improved since Hellot’s time, yet the processes\r\ngiven in this volume are not without their value. The second volume\r\ntreats of the various metallurgic processes followed in order to\r\nextract metals from their ores. This volume is furnished with no fewer\r\nthan fifty-five plates, in which all the various furnaces, &c. used in\r\nthese processes are exhibited to the eye.\r\n\r\nWhile occupied in preparing this work for the press he was chosen to\r\nendeavour to bring the porcelain manufactory at Sevre to a greater\r\nstate of perfection than it had yet reached. In this he was successful.\r\nHe even discovered various new colours proper for painting upon\r\nporcelain; which contributed to give to this manufactory the celebrity\r\nwhich it acquired.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1763 a phenomenon at that time quite new to France took\r\nplace in the coal-mine of Briançon. A quantity of carburetted hydrogen\r\ngas had collected in the bottom of the mine, and being kindled by\r\nthe lights employed by the miners, it exploded with great violence,\r\nand killed or wounded every person in the mine. This destructive gas,\r\ndistinguished in this country by the name of _fire-damp_, had been\r\nlong known in Great Britain and in the Low Countries, though it had\r\nnot before been known in France. The Duke de Choiseul, informed of\r\nthis event, had recourse to the academy for assistance, who appointed\r\nMessrs. de Montigny, Duhamel, and Hellot, a committee to endeavour\r\nto discover the remedies proper to prevent any such accident from\r\nhappening for the future. The report of these gentlemen was published\r\nin the Memoirs of the Academy;[182] they give an account both of the\r\nfire-damp, and _choke-damp_, or _carbonic acid gas_, which sometimes\r\nalso makes its appearance in coal-mines. They very justly observe\r\nthat the proper way to obviate the inconveniency of these gases is to\r\nventilate the mine properly; and they give various methods by which\r\nthis ventilation may be promoted by means of fires lighted at the\r\nbottom of the shaft, &c.\r\n\r\n[182] 1763, p. 235.\r\n\r\nIn 1763 M. Hellot was appointed, conjointly with M. Tillet, to examine\r\nthe process followed for assaying gold and silver. They showed that the\r\ncupels always retained a small portion of the silver assayed, and that\r\nthis loss, ascribed to the presence of a foreign metal, made the purity\r\nof the silver be always reckoned under the truth, which occasioned a\r\nloss to the proprietor.\r\n\r\nHis health continued tolerably good till he reached his eightieth year:\r\nhe was then struck with palsy, but partially recovered from the first\r\nattack; but a second attack, on the 13th of February, 1765, refused\r\nto yield to every medical treatment, and he died on the 15th of that\r\nmonth, at an age a little beyond eighty.\r\n\r\nHenry Louis Duhamel du Monceau was born at Paris in the year 1700.\r\nHe was descended from Loth Duhamel, a Dutch gentleman, who came to\r\nFrance in the suite of the infamous Duke of Burgundy, about the year\r\n1400. Young Duhamel was educated in the College of Harcourt; but the\r\ncourse of study did not suit his taste. He left it with only one fact\r\nengraven on his memory--that men, by observing nature, had created a\r\nscience called _physics_; and he resolved to profit by his freedom\r\nfrom restraint and turn the whole of his attention to that subject. He\r\nlodged near the Jardin du Roi, where alone, at that time, physics were\r\nattended to in Paris. Dufoy, Geoffroy, Lemery, Jussieu, and Vaillant,\r\nwere the friends with whom he associated on coming to Paris. His\r\nindustry was stimulated solely by a love of study, and by the pleasure\r\nwhich he derived from the increase of knowledge; love of fame does not\r\nappear to have entered into his account.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1718 saffron, which is much cultivated in that part of\r\nFrance formerly distinguished by the name of Gâtinois, where Duhamel’s\r\nproperty lay, was attacked by a malady which appeared contagious.\r\nHealthy bulbs, when placed in the neighbourhood of those that were\r\ndiseased, soon became affected with the same malady. Government\r\nconsulted the academy on the subject; and this learned body thought\r\nthey could not do better than request M. Duhamel to investigate the\r\ncause of the disease; though he was only eighteen years of age, and\r\nnot even a member of the academy. He ascertained that the malady was\r\nowing to a parasitical plant, which attached itself to the bulb of the\r\nsaffron, and drew nourishment from it. This plant extended under the\r\nearth, from one bulb to another, and thus infected the whole saffron\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nM. Duhamel formed the resolution at the commencement of his scientific\r\ncareer to devote himself to public utility, and to prosecute those\r\nsubjects which were likely to contribute most effectually to the\r\ncomfort of the lower ranks of men. Much of his time was spent in\r\nendeavouring to promote the culture of vegetables, and in rendering\r\nthat culture more useful to society. This naturally led to a careful\r\nstudy of the physiology of trees. The fruit of this study he gave to\r\nthe world in the year 1758, when his Physique des Arbres was published.\r\nThis constitutes one of the most important works on the subject which\r\nhas ever appeared. It contains a great number of new and original\r\nfacts; and contributed very much indeed to advance this difficult, but\r\nmost important branch of science: nor is it less remarkable for modesty\r\nthan for value. The facts gathered from other sources, even those\r\nwhich make against his own opinions, are most carefully and accurately\r\nstated: the experiments that preceded his are repeated and verified\r\nwith much care; and the reader is left to discover the new facts and\r\nnew views of the author, without any attempt on his part to claim them\r\nas his own.\r\n\r\nM. Duhamel had been attached to the department of the marine by M. de\r\nMaurepas, who had given him the title of _inspector-general_. This led\r\nhim to turn his attention to naval science in general. The construction\r\nof vessels, the weaving of sailcloths, the construction of ropes and\r\ncables, the method of preserving the wood, occupied his attention\r\nsuccessively, and gave birth to several treatises, which, like all\r\nhis works, contain immense collections of facts and experiments. He\r\nendeavours always to discover which is the best practice, to reduce\r\nit to fixed rules, and to support it by philosophical principles; but\r\nabstains from all theory when it can be supported only by hypothesis.\r\n\r\nFrom the year 1740, when he became an academician, till his death\r\nin 1781, he made a regular set of meteorological observations at\r\nPithiviers, with details relative to the direction of the needle, to\r\nagriculture, to the medical constitution of the year, and to the time\r\nof nest-building, and of the passage of birds.\r\n\r\nAbove sixty memoirs of his were published in the Transactions of the\r\nFrench Academy of Sciences. They are so multifarious in their nature,\r\nand embrace such a variety of subjects, that I shall not attempt even\r\nto give their titles, but satisfy myself with stating such only as bear\r\nmore immediately upon the science of chemistry.\r\n\r\nIt will be proper in conducting this review to notice the result of\r\nhis labours connected with the ossification of bones; because, though\r\nnot strictly chemical, they throw light upon some branches of the\r\nanimal economy, more closely connected with chemistry than with any\r\nother of the sciences. He examined, in the first place, whether the\r\nossification of bones, and their formation and reparation, did not\r\nfollow the same law that he had assigned to the increments of trees,\r\nand he established, by a set of experiments, that bones increase by\r\nthe ossification of layers of the periosteum, as trees do by the\r\nhardening of their cortical layers. Bones in a soft state increase in\r\nevery direction, like the young branches of plants; but after their\r\ninduration they increase only like trees, by successive additions of\r\nsuccessive layers. This organization was incompatible with the opinion\r\nof those who thought that bones increased by the addition of an earthy\r\nmatter deposited in the meshes of the organized network which forms\r\nthe texture of bones. M. Duhamel combated this opinion by an ingenious\r\nexperiment. He had been informed by Sir Hans Sloane that the bones\r\nof young animals fed upon madder were tinged red. He conceived the\r\nplan of feeding them alternately with food mingled with madder, and\r\nwith ordinary food. The bones of animals thus treated were found to\r\npresent alternate concentric layers of red and white, corresponding\r\nto the different periods in which the animal had been fed with\r\nfood containing or not containing madder. When these bones are sawn\r\nlongitudinally we see the thickness of the coloured layers, greater or\r\nless, according to the number of plates of the periosteum that have\r\nossified. As for the portions still soft, or susceptible of extending\r\nthemselves in every direction, such as the plates in the neighbourhood\r\nof the marrow, the reservoir of which increases during a part of the\r\ntime that the animal continues to grow, the red colour marks equally\r\nthe progress of their ossification by coloured points more or less\r\nextended.\r\n\r\nThis opinion was attacked by Haller, and defended by M. Fougeroux,\r\nnephew of M. Duhamel; but it is not our business here to inquire how\r\nfar correct.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of M. Duhamel’s papers, which will secure\r\nhis name a proud station in the annals of chemistry, is that which was\r\ninserted in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1737, in which he shows\r\nthat the base of common salt is a true fixed alkali, different in some\r\nrespects from the alkali extracted from land plants, and known by the\r\nname of _potash_, but similar to that obtained by the incineration of\r\nmarine plants. We are surprised that a fact so simple and elementary\r\nwas disputed by the French chemists, and rather indicated than proved\r\nby Stahl and his followers. The conclusions of Duhamel were disputed\r\nby Pott; but finally confirmed by Margraaf. M. Duhamel carried his\r\nresearches further, he wished to know if the difference between potash\r\nand soda depends on the plants that produce them, or on the nature\r\nof the soil in which they grow. He sowed kali at Denainvilliers, and\r\ncontinued his experiments during a great number of years. M. Cadet, at\r\nhis request, examined the salts contained in the ashes of the kali of\r\nDenainvilliers. He found that during the first year soda predominated\r\nin these ashes. During the successive years the potash increased\r\nrapidly, and at last the soda almost entirely disappeared. It was\r\nobvious from this, that the alkalies in plants are drawn at least\r\nchiefly from the soil in which they vegetate.\r\n\r\nThe memoirs of M. Duhamel on ether, at that time almost unknown, on\r\nsoluble tartars, and on lime, contain many facts both curious and\r\naccurately stated; though our present knowledge of these bodies is\r\nso much greater than his--the new facts ascertained respecting them\r\nare so numerous and important, that the contributions of this early\r\nexperimenter, which probably had a considerable share in the success\r\nof subsequent investigations, are now almost forgotten. Nor would many\r\nreaders bear patiently with an attempt to enumerate them.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious paper of his in the Memoirs of the Academy for\r\n1757. In this he gives the details of a spontaneous combustion of\r\nlarge pieces of cloth soaked in oil and strongly pressed. Cloth thus\r\nprepared had often produced similar accidents. Those who were fortunate\r\nenough to prevent them, took care to conceal the facts, partly from\r\nignorance of the real cause of the combustion, and partly from a fear\r\nthat if they were to state what they saw, their testimony would not\r\ngain credit. If the combustion had not been prevented, then the public\r\nvoice would have charged those who had the care of the cloths with\r\nculpable negligence, or even with criminal conduct. The observation\r\nof M. Duhamel, therefore, was useful, in order to prevent such unjust\r\nsuspicions from hindering those concerned from taking the requisite\r\nprecautions. Yet, twenty years after the publication of his paper,\r\ntwo accidental spontaneous combustions, in Russia, were ascribed to\r\ntreason. The empress Catharine II. alone suspected that the combustion\r\nwas spontaneous, and experiments made by her orders fully confirmed the\r\nevidence previously advanced by the French philosopher.\r\n\r\nOne man alone would have been insufficient for all the labours\r\nundertaken by M. Duhamel; but he had a brother who lived upon his\r\nestate at Denainvilliers (the name of which he bore), and divided his\r\ntime between the performance of benevolent actions and studying the\r\noperations of nature. M. Denainvilliers prosecuted in his retreat the\r\nobservations and experiments intrusted by his brother to his charge.\r\nThus in fact the memoirs of Duhamel exhibit the assiduous labours\r\nof two individuals, one of whom contentedly remained unknown to the\r\nworld, satisfied with the good which he did, and the favours which he\r\nconferred upon his country and the human race.\r\n\r\nThe works of M. Duhamel are very voluminous, and are all written with\r\nthe utmost plainness. Every thing is elementary, no previous knowledge\r\nis taken for granted. His writings are not addressed to philosophers,\r\nbut to all those who are in quest of practical knowledge. He has been\r\naccused of diffuseness of style, and of want of correctness; but\r\nhis style is simple and clear; and as his object was to inform, not\r\nphilosophers, but the common people, greater conciseness would have\r\nbeen highly injudicious.\r\n\r\nNeither he nor his brother ever married, but thought it better to\r\ndevote their undivided attention to study. Both were assiduous in no\r\nordinary degree, but the ardour of Duhamel himself continued nearly\r\nundiminished till within a year of his death; when, though he still\r\nattended the meetings of the academy, he no longer took the same\r\ninterest in its proceedings. On the 22d of July, 1781, just after\r\nleaving the academy, he was struck with apoplexy, and died after\r\nlingering twenty-two days in a state of coma.\r\n\r\nHe was without doubt one of the most eminent men of the age in which\r\nhe lived; but his merits as a chemist will chiefly be remembered\r\nin consequence of his being the first person who demonstrated\r\nby satisfactory evidence the peculiar nature of soda, which had\r\nbeen previously confounded with potash. His merits as a vegetable\r\nphysiologist and agriculturist were of a very high order.\r\n\r\nPeter Joseph Macquer was born at Paris, in 1718. His father, Joseph\r\nMacquer, was descended from a noble Scottish family, which had\r\nsacrificed its property and its country, out of attachment to the\r\nfamily of the Stuarts.[183] Young Macquer made choice of medicine as\r\na profession, and devoted himself chiefly to chemistry, for which\r\nhe showed early a decided taste. He was admitted a member of the\r\nAcademy of Sciences in the year 1745, when he was twenty-seven years\r\nof age. Original researches in chemistry, the composition of chemical\r\nelementary works, and the study of the arts connected with chemistry,\r\noccupied the whole remainder of his life.\r\n\r\n[183] I do not know what the true name was of which Macquer is a\r\ncorruption. Ker is a Scottish name belonging to two noble families,\r\nthe Duke of Roxburgh and the Marquis of Lothian; but I am not aware of\r\nM’Ker being a Scottish name: besides, neither of these families was\r\nattached to the house of Stuart.\r\n\r\nHis first paper treated of the effect produced by heating a mixture of\r\nsaltpetre and white arsenic. It was previously known, that when such a\r\nmixture is distilled nitric acid comes over tinged with a blue colour;\r\nbut nobody had thought of examining the residue of this distillation.\r\nMacquer found it soluble in water and capable of crystallizing into a\r\nneutral salt composed of potash (the base of saltpetre), and an acid\r\ninto which the arsenic was changed by the nitric acid communicating\r\noxygen to it.\r\n\r\nMacquer found that a similar salt might be obtained with soda or\r\nammonia for its base. Thus he was the first person who pointed out\r\nthe existence of arsenic acid, and ascertained the properties of some\r\nof the salts which it forms. But he made no attempt to obtain arsenic\r\nacid in a separate state, or to determine its properties. That very\r\nimportant step was reserved for Scheele, for Macquer seems to have had\r\nno suspicion of the true nature of the salt which he had formed.\r\n\r\nHis next set of experiments was on Prussian blue. He made the first\r\nstep towards the discovery of the nature of the principle to which\r\nthat pigment owes its colour. Prussian blue had been accidentally\r\ndiscovered by Diesbach, an operative chemist of Berlin, in 1710, but\r\nthe mode of producing it was kept secret till it was published in\r\n1724, by Dr. Woodward in the Philosophical Transactions. It consisted\r\nin mixing potash and blood together, and heating the mixture in a\r\ncovered crucible, having a small hole in the lid, till it ceased to\r\ngive out smoke. The solution of this mixture in water, when mixed with\r\na solution of sulphate of iron, threw down a green powder, which became\r\nblue when treated with muriatic acid: this blue matter was _Prussian\r\nblue_. Macquer ascertained that when Prussian blue is exposed to a\r\nred heat its blue colour disappears, and it is converted into common\r\nperoxide of iron. Hence he concluded that Prussian blue is a compound\r\nof oxide of iron, and of something which is destroyed or driven off\r\nby a red heat. He showed that this something possessed the characters\r\nof an acid; for when Prussian blue is boiled with caustic potash it\r\nloses its blue colour, and if the potash be boiled with successive\r\nportions of Prussian blue, as long as it is capable of discolouring\r\nthem, it loses the characters of an acid and assumes those of a neutral\r\nsalt, and at the same time acquires the property of precipitating iron\r\nfrom the solutions of the sulphate at once of a blue colour. Macquer\r\nascribed the green colour thrown down, by mixing the blood-lie and\r\nsulphate of iron to the potash in the blood-lie, not being saturated\r\nwith the colouring matter of Prussian blue. Hence a portion of the iron\r\nis thrown down in the state of Prussian blue, and another portion in\r\nthat of yellow oxide of iron: these two being mixed form a green. The\r\nmuriatic acid dissolves the yellow oxide and leaves the Prussian blue\r\nuntouched. Macquer, however, did not succeed in determining the nature\r\nof the colouring matter; a task reserved for Scheele, whose lot it was\r\nto take up the half-finished investigations of Macquer, and throw upon\r\nthem a new and brilliant light. Macquer thought that this colouring\r\nmatter was _phlogiston_. On that account the potash saturated with\r\nit, which was employed by chemists to detect the presence of iron by\r\nforming with it Prussian blue, was called _phlogisticated alkali_.\r\n\r\nMacquer, conjointly with Baumé, subjected the grains of crude platinum,\r\nto which the attention of chemists had been newly drawn, to experiment.\r\nTheir principle object was to examine its fusibility and ductility.\r\nThey succeeded in fusing it imperfectly, by means of a burning\r\nmirror, and found that the grains thus treated were not destitute of\r\nductility. But upon the whole the experiments of these chemists threw\r\nbut little light upon the subject. Many years elapsed before chemists\r\nwere able to work this refractory metal, and to make it into vessels\r\nfitted for the uses of the laboratory. For this important improvement,\r\nwhich constitutes an era in chemistry, the chemical world was chiefly\r\nindebted to Dr. Wollaston.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1750 M. Macquer was charged with a commission by the court.\r\nThere existed at that time in Brittany a man, the Count de la Garaie,\r\nwho, yielding to a passion for benevolence, had for forty years devoted\r\nhimself to the service of suffering humanity. He had built an hospital\r\nby the side of a chemical laboratory: he took care of the patients in\r\nthe hospital himself; and treated them with medicines prepared in his\r\nlaboratory. Some of these were new, and, in his opinion, excellent\r\nmedicines; and he offered to sell them to government for the service of\r\nhis hospital. Macquer was charged by government with the examination of\r\nthese medicines. The project of the Count de la Garaie was to extract\r\nthe salutary parts of minerals, by a long maceration with neutral\r\nsalts. Among other things he had prepared a mercurial tincture, by a\r\nprocess which lasted several months: but this tincture was merely a\r\nsolution of corrosive sublimate in spirit of wine. Such is the history\r\nof most of those boasted secrets; sometimes they are chimerical, and\r\nsometimes known to all the world, except to those who purchase them.\r\n\r\nM. Macquer had the fortune to live at a time when chemistry began to\r\nbe freed from the reveries of alchymists; but methodical arrangement\r\nwas a merit still unknown to the elementary chemical books, especially\r\nin France, where a residue of Cartesianism added to the natural\r\nobscurity of the science, by surcharging it with pretended mechanical\r\nexplanations. Macquer was the first French chemist who gave to an\r\nelementary treatise the same clearness, simplicity, and method,\r\nwhich is to be found in the other branches of science. This was no\r\nsmall merit, and undoubtedly contributed considerably to the rapid\r\nimprovement of the science which so speedily followed. His elements\r\nof chemistry were translated into different languages, especially\r\ninto English; and long constituted the textbook employed in the\r\ndifferent European universities. Dr. Black recommended it for many\r\nyears in the University of Edinburgh. Indeed, it was only superseded in\r\nconsequence of the new views introduced into chemistry by Lavoisier,\r\nwhich, requiring a new language to render them intelligible, naturally\r\nsuperseded all the elementary chemical books which had preceded the\r\nintroduction of that language.\r\n\r\nMacquer, during a number of years, delivered regular courses of\r\nchemical lectures, conjointly with Baumé. In these courses he preferred\r\nthat arrangement which appeared to him to require the least preliminary\r\nknowledge of chemistry. He described the experiments, stated the facts\r\nwith clearness and precision, and explained them in the way which\r\nappeared to him most plausible, according to the opinions generally\r\nreceived; but without placing much confidence in the accuracy of these\r\nexplanations. He thought it necessary to theorize a little, to enable\r\nhis pupils the better to connect the facts and to remember them; and to\r\nput an end to that painful state of uncertainty which always results\r\nfrom a collection of facts without any theoretical links to bind\r\nthem together. When the discoveries of Lavoisier began to shake the\r\nfoundation of the Stahlian theory, Macquer was old; and it appears from\r\na letter of his, published by Delametherie in the Journal de Physique,\r\nthat he was alarmed at the prophetic announcements of Lavoisier in\r\nthe academy that the reign of Phlogiston was drawing towards an end.\r\nM. Condorcet assures us that his attachment to theory, by which he\r\nmeans phlogiston, was by no means strong;[184] but his own letter to\r\nDelametherie rather shows that this statement was not quite correct.\r\nHow, indeed, could he fail to experience an attachment to opinions\r\nwhich it had been the business of his whole life to inculcate?\r\n\r\n[184] Hist. de l’Acad. R. des Sciences, 1784, p. 24.\r\n\r\nMacquer also published a dictionary of chemistry, which was very\r\nsuccessful, and which was translated into most of the European\r\nlanguages. This mode of treating chemistry was well suited to a science\r\nstill in its infancy, and which did not yet constitute a complete\r\nwhole. It enabled him to discuss the different topics in succession,\r\nand independent of each other: and thus to introduce much important\r\nmatter which could not easily have been introduced into a systematic\r\nwork on chemistry. The second edition of this dictionary was published\r\njust at the time when the gases began to attract the attention of\r\nscientific men; when facts began to multiply with prodigious rapidity,\r\nand to shake the confidence of chemists in all received theories. He\r\nacquitted himself of the difficult task of collecting and stating\r\nthese new facts with considerable success; and doubtless communicated\r\nmuch new information to his countrymen: for the discoveries connected\r\nwith the gases originated, and were chiefly made, in England, from\r\nwhich, on account of the revolutionary American war, there was some\r\ndifficulty of obtaining early information.\r\n\r\nM. Hellot, who was commissioner of the counsel for dyeing, and chemist\r\nto the porcelain manufacture, requested to have M. Macquer for an\r\nassociate. This request did much honour to Hellot, as he was conscious\r\nthat the reputation of Macquer as a chemist was superior to his\r\nown. Macquer endeavoured, in the first place, to lay down the true\r\nprinciples of the art of dyeing, as the best method of dissipating the\r\nobscurity which still hung over it. A great part of his treatise on\r\nthe art of dyeing silk, published in the collection of the Academy of\r\nSciences, has these principles for its object. He gave processes also\r\nfor dyeing silk with Prussian blue, and for giving to silk, by means\r\nof cochineal, as brilliant a scarlet colour as can be given to woollen\r\ncloth by the same dye-stuff. He published nothing on the porcelain\r\nmanufacture, though he attended particularly to the processes, and\r\nintroduced several ameliorations. The beautiful porcelain earth at\r\npresent used at Sevre, was discovered in consequence of a premium which\r\nhe offered to any person who could point out a clay in every respect\r\nproper for making porcelain.\r\n\r\nMacquer passed a great part of his life with a brother, whom he\r\naffectionately loved: after his death he devoted himself entirely to\r\nhis wife and two children, whose education he superintended. He was\r\nrather averse to society, but conducted himself while in it with much\r\nsweetness and affability. He was fond of tranquillity and independence.\r\nThough his health had been injured a good many years before his death,\r\nthe calmness and serenity of his temper prevented strangers from being\r\naware that he was afflicted with any malady. He himself was sensible\r\nthat his strength was gradually sinking; he predicted his approaching\r\nend to his wife, whom he thanked for the happiness which she had spread\r\nover his life. He left orders that his body should be opened after his\r\ndecease, that the cause of his death might be discovered. He died on\r\nthe 15th of February, 1784. An ossification of the aorta, and several\r\ncalculous concretions found in the cavities of the heart, had been the\r\ncause of the disease under which he had suffered for several years\r\nbefore his death.\r\n\r\nThese four chemists, of whose lives a sketch has just been given, were\r\nthe most eminent that France ever produced belonging to the Stahlian\r\nschool of chemistry. Baron, Malouin, Rouelle senior, Tillet, Cadet,\r\nBaumé, Sage, and several others whose names I purposely omit, likewise\r\ncultivated chemistry, during that period, with assiduity and success;\r\nand were each of them the authors of papers which deserve attention,\r\nbut which it would be impossible to particularize without swelling this\r\nwork into a size greatly beyond its proper limits.\r\n\r\nHilaire-Marin Rouelle, who was born at Caen in 1718, was, however, too\r\neminent a chemist to be passed over in silence. His elder brother,\r\nWilliam Francis, was a member of the Academy of Sciences, and\r\ndemonstrator to Macquer, who gave lectures in the Jardin du Roi. At\r\nthe death of Macquer, in 1770, Hilaire-Marin Rouelle succeeded him. He\r\ndevoted the whole of his time and money to this situation, and quite\r\naltered the nature of the experimental course of chemistry given in the\r\nJardin du Roi. He was in some measure the author of the chemistry of\r\nanimal bodies, at least in France. When he published his experiments\r\non the salts of urine, and of blood, he had scarcely any model; and\r\nthough he committed some considerable mistakes, he ascertained several\r\nessential and important facts, which have been since fully confirmed\r\nby more modern experimenters. He died on the 7th of April, 1779, aged\r\nsixty-one years. His temper was peculiar, and he was too honest and\r\ntoo open for the situation in which he was placed, and for a state of\r\nsociety in which every thing was carried by intrigue and finesse. This\r\nis the reason why, in France, his reputation was lower than it ought\r\nto have been. It accounts, too, for his never becoming a member of\r\nthe Academy of Sciences, nor of any of the other numerous academies\r\nwhich at that time swarmed in France. Nothing is more common than to\r\nfind these unjust decisions raise or depress men of science far above\r\nor far below their true standard. Romé de Lisle, the first person who\r\ncommenced the study of crystals, and placed that study in a proper\r\npoint of view, was a man of the same stamp with the younger Rouelle,\r\nand never on that account, became a member of any academy, or acquired\r\nthat reputation during his lifetime, to which his laborious career\r\njustly entitled him. It would be an easy, though an invidious task, to\r\npoint out various individuals, especially in France, whose reputation,\r\nin consequence of accidental and adventitious circumstances, rose just\r\nas much above their deserts, as those of Rouelle, and Romé de Lisle\r\nwere sunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nOF THE FOUNDATION AND PROGRESS OF SCIENTIFIC CHEMISTRY IN GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spirit which Newton had infused for the mathematical science\r\nwas so great, that during many years they drew within their vortex\r\nalmost all the scientific men in Great Britain. Dr. Stephen Hales is\r\nalmost the only remarkable exception, during the early part of the\r\neighteenth century. His vegetable statics constituted a most ingenious\r\nand valuable contribution to vegetable physiology. His hæmastatics was\r\na no less valuable contribution to iatro-mathematics, at that time\r\nthe fashionable medical theory in Great Britain. While his _analysis\r\nof air_, and experiments on the animal calculus constituted, in all\r\nprobability, the foundation-stone of the whole discoveries respecting\r\nthe gases to which the great subsequent progress of chemistry is\r\nchiefly owing.\r\n\r\nDr. William Cullen, to whom medicine lies under deep obligations,\r\nand who afterwards raised the medical celebrity of the College of\r\nEdinburgh to so high a pitch, had the merit of first perceiving the\r\nimportance of scientific chemistry, and the reputation which that man\r\nwas likely to earn, who should devote himself to the cultivation of\r\nit. Hitherto chemistry in Great Britain, and on the continent also,\r\nwas considered as a mere appendage to medicine, and useful only so\r\nfar as it contributed to the formation of new and useful remedies.\r\nThis was the reason why it came to constitute an essential part of the\r\neducation of every medical man, and why a physician was considered as\r\nunfit for practice unless he was also a chemist. But Dr. Cullen viewed\r\nthe science as far more important; as capable of throwing light on the\r\nconstitution of bodies, and of improving and amending of those arts and\r\nmanufactures that are most useful to man. He resolved to devote himself\r\nto its cultivation and improvement; and he would undoubtedly have\r\nderived celebrity from this science, had not his fate led rather to the\r\ncultivation of medicine. But Dr. Cullen, as the true commencer of the\r\nstudy of scientific chemistry in Great Britain, claims a conspicuous\r\nplace in this historical sketch.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cullen was born in Lanarkshire, in Scotland, in the year\r\n1712, on the 11th of December. His father, though chief magistrate of\r\nHamilton, was not in circumstances to lay out much money on his son.\r\nWilliam, therefore, after serving an apprenticeship to a surgeon in\r\nGlasgow, went several voyages to the West Indies, as surgeon, in a\r\ntrading-vessel from London; but tiring of this, he settled, when very\r\nyoung, in the parish of Shotts; and after residing for a short time\r\namong the farmers and country people, he went to Hamilton, with a view\r\nof practising as a physician.\r\n\r\nWhile he resided near Shotts, it happened that Archibald, Duke of\r\nArgyle, who at that time bore the chief political sway in Scotland,\r\npaid a visit to a gentleman of rank in that neighbourhood. The duke\r\nwas fond of science, and was at that time engaged in some chemical\r\nresearches which required to be elucidated by experiment. Eager in\r\nthese pursuits, while on his visit he found himself at a loss for some\r\npiece of chemical apparatus which his landlord could not furnish; but\r\nhe mentioned young Cullen to the duke as a person fond of chemistry,\r\nand likely therefore to possess the required apparatus. He was\r\naccordingly invited to dine, and introduced to his Grace. The duke\r\nwas so pleased with his knowledge, politeness, and address, that an\r\nacquaintance commenced, which laid the foundation of all Cullen’s\r\nfuture advancement.\r\n\r\nHis residence in Hamilton naturally made his name known to the Duke of\r\nHamilton, whose palace is situated in the immediate vicinity of that\r\ntown. His Grace being taken with a sudden illness, sent for Cullen,\r\nand was highly delighted with the sprightly character, and ingenious\r\nconversation of the young physician. He found no difficulty, especially\r\nas young Cullen was already known to the Duke of Argyle, in getting him\r\nappointed to a place in the University of Glasgow, where his singular\r\ntalents as a teacher soon became very conspicuous.\r\n\r\nIt was while Dr. Cullen was a practitioner in Shotts that he formed a\r\nconnexion with William, afterwards Doctor Hunter, the famous lecturer\r\non anatomy in London, who was a native of the same part of the country\r\nas Cullen. These two young men, stimulated by genius, though thwarted\r\nby the narrowness of their circumstances, entered into a copartnery\r\nbusiness, as surgeons and apothecaries, in the country. The chief\r\nobject of their contract was to furnish the parties with the means\r\nof carrying on their medical studies, which they were not able to do\r\nseparately. It was stipulated that one of them, alternately, should be\r\nallowed to study in whatever college he preferred, during the winter,\r\nwhile the other carried on the common business in his absence. In\r\nconsequence of this agreement, Cullen was first allowed to study in\r\nthe University of Edinburgh, for a winter. When it came to Hunter’s\r\nturn next winter, he rather chose to go to London. There his singular\r\nneatness in dissecting, and uncommon dexterity in making anatomical\r\npreparations, his assiduity in study, his mild manners, and easy\r\ntemper, drew upon him the attention of Dr. Douglas, who at that time\r\nread lectures on anatomy and midwifery in the capital. He engaged\r\nhim as his assistant, and he afterwards succeeded him in the same\r\ndepartment with much honour to himself, and advantage to the public.\r\nThus was dissolved a copartnership of perhaps as singular a kind as any\r\nthat occurs in the annals of science. Cullen was not disposed to let\r\nany engagement with him prove a bar to his partner’s advancement in the\r\nworld. The articles were abandoned, and Cullen and Hunter kept up ever\r\nafter a friendly correspondence; though there is reason to believe that\r\nthey never afterwards met.\r\n\r\nIt was while a country practitioner that young Cullen married a Miss\r\nJohnston, daughter of a neighbouring clergyman. The connexion was\r\nfortunate and lasting. She brought her husband a numerous family, and\r\ncontinued his faithful companion through all the alterations of his\r\nfortune. She died in the summer of 1786.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1746 Cullen, who had now taken the degree of doctor of\r\nmedicine, was appointed lecturer on chemistry in the University of\r\nGlasgow; and in the month of October began a course on that science.\r\nHis singular talent for arrangement, his distinctness of enunciation,\r\nhis vivacity of manner, and his knowledge of the science which he\r\ntaught, rendered his lectures interesting to a degree which had\r\nbeen till then unknown in that university: he was adored by the\r\nstudents. The former professors were eclipsed by the brilliancy of his\r\nreputation, and he had to encounter all those little rubs and insults\r\nthat disappointed envy naturally threw in his way. But he proceeded in\r\nhis career regardless of these petty mortifications; and supported by\r\nthe public, he was more than consoled for the contumely heaped upon him\r\nby the ill nature and pitiful malignity of his colleagues. His practice\r\nas a physician increased every day, and a vacancy occurring in the\r\nchair in 1751, he was appointed by the crown professor of medicine,\r\nwhich put him on a footing of equality with his colleagues in the\r\nuniversity. This new appointment called forth powers which he was not\r\nbefore known to possess, and thus served still further to increase his\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\nAt that time the patrons of the University of Edinburgh were eagerly\r\nbent on raising the reputation of their medical school, and were in\r\nconsequence on the look out for men of abilities and reputation to fill\r\ntheir respective chairs. Their attention was soon drawn towards Cullen,\r\nand on the death of Dr. Plummer, in 1756, he was unanimously invited to\r\nfill the vacant _chemical chair_. He accepted the invitation, and began\r\nhis academical career in the College of Edinburgh in October of that\r\nyear, and here he continued during the remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Dr. Cullen in the College of Edinburgh constitutes\r\na memorable era in the progress of that celebrated school. Hitherto\r\nchemistry being reckoned of little importance, had been attended by\r\nvery few students; when Cullen began to lecture it became a favourite\r\nstudy, almost all the students flocking to hear him, and the chemical\r\nclass becoming immediately more numerous than any other in the college,\r\nanatomy alone excepted. The students in general spoke of the new\r\nprofessor with that rapturous ardour so natural to young men when\r\nhighly pleased. These eulogiums were doubtless extravagant, and proved\r\ndisgusting to his colleagues. A party was formed to oppose this new\r\nfavourite of the public. His opinions were misrepresented, it was\r\naffirmed that he taught doctrines which excited the alarm of some of\r\nthe most moderate and conscientious of his colleagues. Thus a violent\r\nferment was excited, and some time elapsed before the malignant arts by\r\nwhich this flame had been blown up were discovered.\r\n\r\nDuring this time of public ferment Cullen went steadily forward; he\r\nnever gave an ear to the gossip brought him respecting the conduct\r\nof his colleagues, nor did he take any notice of the doctrines which\r\nthey taught. Some of their unguarded strictures on himself might\r\noccasionally have come to his ears; but if it was so, he took no notice\r\nof them whatever; they seemed to have made no impression on him.\r\n\r\nThis futile attempt to lower his character being thus baffled, his fame\r\nas a professor, and his reputation as a physician, increased daily: nor\r\ncould it be otherwise; his professional knowledge was always great, and\r\nhis manner of lecturing singularly clear and intelligible, lively, and\r\nentertaining. To his patients his conduct was so pleasing, his address\r\nso affable and engaging, and his manner so open, so kind, and so little\r\nregulated by pecuniary considerations, that those who once applied to\r\nhim for medical assistance could never afterwards dispense with it: he\r\nbecame the friend and companion of every family he visited, and his\r\nfuture acquaintance could not be dispensed with.\r\n\r\nHis private conduct to his students was admirable, and deservedly\r\nendeared him to every one of them. He was so uniformly attentive to\r\nthem, and took so much interest in the concerns of those who applied\r\nto him for advice; was so cordial and so warm, that it was impossible\r\nfor any one, who had a heart susceptible of generous emotions, not to\r\nbe delighted with a conduct so uncommon and so kind. It was this which\r\nserved more than any thing else to extend his reputation over every\r\ncivilized quarter of the globe. Among ingenuous youth gratitude easily\r\ndegenerates into rapture; hence the popularity which he enjoyed, and\r\nwhich to those who do not well weigh the causes which operated on the\r\nstudents must appear excessive.\r\n\r\nThe general conduct of Cullen to his students was this: with all\r\nsuch as he observed to be attentive and diligent he formed an early\r\nacquaintance, by inviting them by twos, by threes, and by fours at a\r\ntime to sup with him; conversing with them at such times with the most\r\nengaging ease, entering freely with them into the subject of their\r\nstudies, their amusements, their difficulties, their hopes and future\r\nprospects. In this way he usually invited the whole of his numerous\r\nclass till he made himself acquainted with their private character,\r\ntheir abilities, and their objects of pursuit. Those of whom he formed\r\nthe highest opinion were of course invited most frequently, till an\r\nintimacy was gradually formed which proved highly beneficial to them.\r\nTo their doubts and difficulties he listened with the most obliging\r\ncondescension, and he solved them to the utmost of his power. His\r\nlibrary was at all times open for their accommodation: in short, he\r\ntreated them as if they had been all his relatives and friends. Few men\r\nof distinction left the University of Edinburgh, in his time, with whom\r\nhe did not keep up a correspondence till they were fairly established\r\nin business. This enabled him gradually to form an accurate knowledge\r\nof the state of medicine in every country, and the knowledge thus\r\nacquired put it in his power to direct students in the choice of places\r\nwhere they might have an opportunity of engaging in business with a\r\nreasonable prospect of success.\r\n\r\nNor was it in this way alone that he befriended the students in the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh. Remembering the difficulties with which he had\r\nhimself to struggle in his younger days, he was at all times singularly\r\nattentive to the pecuniary wants of the students. From the general\r\nintimacy which he contracted with them he found no difficulty in\r\ndiscovering those whose circumstances were contracted, or who laboured\r\nunder any pecuniary embarrassment, without being under the necessity of\r\nhurting their feelings by a direct inquiry. To such persons, when their\r\nhabits of study admitted it, he was peculiarly attentive: they were\r\nmore frequently invited to his house than others, they were treated\r\nwith unusual kindness and familiarity, they were conducted to his\r\nlibrary and encouraged by the most delicate address to borrow from it\r\nfreely whatever books he thought they had occasion for; and as persons\r\nunder such circumstances are often extremely shy, books were sometimes\r\npressed upon them as a sort of task, the doctor insisting upon knowing\r\ntheir opinion of such and such passages which they had not read, and\r\ndesiring them to carry the book home for that purpose: in short, he\r\nbehaved to them as if he had courted their company. He thus raised\r\nthem in the opinion of their acquaintances, which, to persons in their\r\ncircumstances, was of no little consequence. They were inspired at the\r\nsame time with a secret sense of dignity, which elevated their minds,\r\nand excited an uncommon ardour, instead of that desponding inactivity\r\nso natural to depressed circumstances. Nor was he less delicate in the\r\nmanner of supplying their wants: he often found out some polite excuse\r\nfor refusing to take money for a first course, and never was at a loss\r\nfor one to an after course. Sometimes (as his lectures were never\r\nwritten) he would request the favour of a sight of their notes, if he\r\nknew that they were taken with care, in order to refresh his memory.\r\nSometimes he would express a wish to have their opinion of a particular\r\npart of his course, and presented them with a ticket for the purpose.\r\nBy such delicate pieces of address, in which he greatly excelled, he\r\ntook care to anticipate their wants. Thus he not only gave them the\r\nbenefit of his own lectures, but by refusing to take money enabled them\r\nto attend such others as were necessary for completing their course of\r\nmedical study.\r\n\r\nHe introduced another general rule into the university dictated by the\r\nsame spirit of disinterested benevolence. Before he came to Edinburgh,\r\nit was the custom of the medical professors to accept of fees for their\r\nmedical attendance when wanted, even from medical students themselves,\r\nthough they were perhaps attending the professor’s lectures at the\r\ntime. But Dr. Cullen never would take a fee from any student of the\r\nuniversity, though he attended them, when called on as a physician,\r\nwith the same assiduity and care as if they had been persons of the\r\nfirst rank who paid him most liberally. This gradually led others\r\nto follow his example; and it has now become a general rule for\r\nmedical professors to decline taking any fees when their assistance\r\nis necessary to a student. For this useful reform, as well as for\r\nmany others, the students in the University of Edinburgh are entirely\r\nindebted to Dr. Cullen.\r\n\r\nThe first lectures which Dr. Cullen delivered in Edinburgh were on\r\nchemistry; and for many years he also gave lectures on the cases\r\nthat occurred in the infirmary. In the month of February, 1763, Dr.\r\nAlston died, after having begun his usual course of lectures on the\r\nmateria medica. The magistrates of Edinburgh, who are the patrons of\r\nthe university, appointed Dr. Cullen to that chair, requesting that\r\nhe would finish the course of lectures that had been begun by his\r\npredecessor. This he agreed to do, and, though he had only a few days\r\nto prepare himself, he never once thought of reading the lectures of\r\nhis predecessor, but resolved to deliver a new course, which should be\r\nentirely his own. Some idea may be formed of the popularity of Cullen,\r\nby the increase of students to a class nearly half finished: Dr. Alston\r\nhad been lecturing to ten; as soon as Dr. Cullen began, a hundred new\r\nstudents enrolled themselves.\r\n\r\nSome years after, on the death of Dr. Whytt, professor of the theory of\r\nmedicine, Dr. Cullen was appointed to give lectures in his stead. It\r\nwas then that he thought it requisite to resign the chemical chair in\r\nfavour of Dr. Black, his former pupil, whose talents in that department\r\nof science were well known. Soon after, on the death of Dr. Rutherford,\r\nprofessor of the practice of medicine, Dr. John Gregory having become a\r\ncandidate for this place, along with Dr. Cullen, a sort of compromise\r\ntook place between them, by which they agreed to give lectures\r\nalternately, on the theory and practice of medicine, during their joint\r\nlives, the longest survivor being allowed to hold either of the classes\r\nhe should incline. Unluckily this arrangement was soon destroyed, by\r\nthe sudden and unexpected death of Dr. Gregory, in the flower of his\r\nage. Dr. Cullen thenceforth continued to give lectures on the practice\r\nof medicine till within a few months of his death, which happened on\r\nthe 5th of February, 1790, when he was in the seventy-seventh year of\r\nhis age.\r\n\r\nIt is not our business to follow Dr. Cullen’s medical career, nor\r\nto point out the great benefits which he conferred on nosology and\r\nthe practice of medicine. He taught four different classes in the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh, which we are not aware to have happened to any\r\nother individual, except to professor Dugald Stewart.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the important impulse which he gave to chemistry,\r\nhe published nothing upon that science, except a short paper on the\r\ncold produced by the evaporation of ether, which made its appearance\r\nin one of the volumes of the Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays.\r\nDr. Cullen employed Dr. Dobson of Liverpool, at that time his pupil,\r\nto make experiments on the heat and cold produced by mixing liquids\r\nand solids with each other. Dr. Dobson, in making these experiments,\r\nobserved that the thermometer, when lifted out of many of the liquids,\r\nand suspended a short time in the air beside them, fell to a lower\r\ndegree than indicated by another thermometer which had undergone no\r\nsuch process. After varying his observations on this phenomenon, he\r\nfound reason to conclude that it was occasioned by the evaporation of\r\nthe last drop of liquid which adhered to the bulb of the thermometer;\r\nthe sinking of the thermometer being always greatest when this\r\ninstrument was taken out of the most volatile liquids. Dr. Cullen\r\nhad the curiosity to try whether the same phenomenon would appear\r\non repeating these experiments under the exhausted receiver of an\r\nair-pump. To satisfy himself, he put on the plate of the air-pump\r\na glass goblet containing water; and in the goblet he placed a\r\nwide-mouthed phial containing sulphuric ether. The whole was covered\r\nwith an air-pump receiver, having at the upper end a collar of leathers\r\nin a brass socket, through which a thick smooth wire could be moved;\r\nand from the lower end of this wire, projecting into the receiver, was\r\nsuspended a thermometer. By pushing down the wire, the thermometer\r\ncould be dipped into the ether; by drawing it up it could be taken out,\r\nand suspended over the phial.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus being thus adjusted, the air-pump was worked to extract\r\nthe air. An unexpected phenomenon immediately appeared, which prevented\r\nthe experiment from being made in the way intended. The ether was\r\nthrown into a violent agitation, which Dr. Cullen ascribed to the\r\nextrication of a great quantity of air: in reality, however, it was\r\nboiling violently. What was still more remarkable, the ether, by this\r\nboiling or rapid evaporation, became all of a sudden so cold, as to\r\nfreeze the water in the goblet around it; though the temperature of\r\nthe air and of all the materials were at the fifty-fourth degree of\r\nFahrenheit at the beginning of the experiment.\r\n\r\nI have been particular in giving an account of this curious phenomenon,\r\nas it was the only direct contribution to the science of chemistry\r\nwhich Dr. Cullen communicated to the public. The nature of the\r\nphenomenon was afterwards explained by Dr. Black; in addition to Dr.\r\nCullen, a philosopher, whom the grand stimulus which his lectures gave\r\nto the cultivation of scientific chemistry in this country, had the\r\nimportant merit of bringing forward.\r\n\r\nJoseph Black was born in France, on the banks of the Garonne, in the\r\nyear 1728: his father, Mr. John Black, was a native of Belfast, but\r\nof a Scottish family which had been for some time settled there. Mr.\r\nBlack resided for the most part at Bordeaux, where he was engaged in\r\nthe wine trade. He married a daughter of Mr. Robert Gordon, of the\r\nfamily of Hillhead, in Aberdeenshire, who was also engaged in the same\r\ntrade at Bordeaux. Mr. Black was a gentleman of most amiable manners,\r\ncandid and liberal in his sentiments, and of no common information.\r\nThese qualities, together with the warmth of his heart, appear very\r\nconspicuous in a series of letters to his son, which that son preserved\r\nwith the nicest care. His good qualities did not escape the discerning\r\neye of the great Montesquieu, one of the presidents of the court of\r\njustice in that province. This illustrious and excellent man honoured\r\nMr. Black with a friendship and intimacy altogether rare; of which his\r\ndescendants were justly proud.\r\n\r\nLong before Mr. Black retired from business, his son Joseph was sent\r\nhome to Belfast, that he might have the education of a British subject.\r\nThis was in the year 1740, when he was twelve years of age. After the\r\nordinary instruction at the grammar-school, he was sent, in 1746, to\r\ncontinue his education in the University of Glasgow. Here he studied\r\nwith much assiduity and success: physical science, however, chiefly\r\nengrossed his attention. He was a favourite pupil of Dr. Robert Dick,\r\nprofessor of natural philosophy, and the intimate companion of his\r\nson and successor. This young professor was of a character peculiarly\r\nsuited to Dr. Black’s taste, having the clearest conception, and\r\nsoundest judgment, accompanied by a modesty that was very uncommon.\r\nWhen he succeeded his father, in 1751, he became the delight of the\r\nstudents. He was carried off by a fever in 1757.\r\n\r\nYoung Black being required by his father to make choice of a\r\nprofession, he preferred that of medicine as the most suitable to the\r\ngeneral habits of his studies. Fortunately Dr. Cullen had just begun\r\nhis great career in the College of Glasgow, and having made choice\r\nof the field of philosophical chemistry which lay as yet unoccupied\r\nbefore him. Hitherto chemistry had been treated as a curious and useful\r\nart; but Cullen saw in it a vast department of the science of nature,\r\ndepending on principles as immutable as the laws of mechanism, and\r\ncapable of being formed into a system as comprehensive and as complete\r\nas astronomy itself. He conceived the resolution of attempting himself\r\nto explore this magnificent field, and expected much reputation from\r\naccomplishing his object. Nor was he altogether disappointed. He\r\nquickly took the science out of the hands of artists, and exhibited\r\nit as a study fit for a gentleman. Dr. Black attended his chemical\r\nlectures, and, from the character which has already been given of him,\r\nit is needless to say that he soon discovered the uncommon value of\r\nhis pupil, and attached him to himself, rather as a co-operator and a\r\nfriend, than a pupil. He was considered as his assistant in all his\r\noperations, and his experiments were frequently adduced in the lecture\r\nas good authority.\r\n\r\nYoung Black laid down a very comprehensive and serious plan of study.\r\nThis appears from a number of note-books found among his papers. There\r\nare some in which he seems to have inserted every thing as it took his\r\nfancy, in medicine, chemistry, jurisprudence, or matters of taste. Into\r\nothers, the same things are transferred, but distributed according\r\nto their scientific connexions. In short, he kept a journal and\r\nledger of his studies, and has posted his books like a merchant. What\r\nparticularly strikes one in looking over these books, is the steadiness\r\nwith which he advanced in any path of knowledge. Things are inserted\r\nfor the first time from some present impression of their singularity or\r\nimportance, but without any allusion to their connexions. When a thing\r\nof the same kind is mentioned again, there is generally a reference\r\nback to its fellow; and thus the most isolated facts often acquired a\r\nconnexion which gave them importance.\r\n\r\nHe went to Edinburgh to finish his medical studies in 1750 or 1751,\r\nwhere he lived with his cousin german, Mr. James Russel, professor of\r\nnatural philosophy in that university.\r\n\r\nIt was the good fortune of chemical science, that at this very time\r\nthe opinions of professors were divided concerning the manner in\r\nwhich certain lithontriptic medicines, particularly lime-water, acted\r\nin alleviating the excruciating pains of the stone and gravel. The\r\nstudents usually partake of such differences of opinion: they are\r\nthereby animated to more serious study, and science gains by their\r\nemulation. This was a subject quite to the taste of young Mr. Black,\r\none of Dr. Cullen’s most zealous and intelligent chemical pupils. It\r\nwas, indeed, a most interesting subject, both to the chemist and the\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nAll the medicines which were then in vogue as solvents of urinary\r\ncalculi had a greater or less resemblance to caustic potash or soda;\r\nsubstances so acrid, when in a concentrated state, that in a short time\r\nthey reduce the fleshy parts of the animal body to a mere pulp. Thus,\r\nthough they might possess lithontriptic properties, their exhibition\r\nwas dangerous, if in unskilful hands. They all seemed to derive their\r\nefficacy from quicklime, which again derives its power from the fire.\r\nIt was therefore very natural for them to ascribe its power to igneous\r\nmatter imbibed from the fire, retained by the lime, and communicated by\r\nit to alkalies, which it renders powerfully acrid. Hence, undoubtedly,\r\nthe term _caustic_ applied to the alkalies in that state, and hence\r\nalso the _acidum pingue_ of Mayer, which was a peculiar state of fire.\r\nIt appears from Dr. Black’s note-books, that he originally entertained\r\nthe opinion, that caustic alkalies acquired igneous matter from\r\nquicklime. In one of them he hints at some way of catching this matter\r\nas it escapes from lime, while it becomes mild by exposure to the\r\nair; but on the opposite blank page is written, “Nothing escapes--the\r\ncup rises considerably by absorbing air.” A few pages further on,\r\nhe compares the loss of weight sustained by an ounce of chalk when\r\ncalcined, with its loss while dissolved in muriatic acid. Immediately\r\nafter this, a medical case is mentioned, which occurred in November,\r\n1752. Hence it would appear, that he had before that time suspected the\r\nreal cause of the difference between limestone and burnt lime. He had\r\nprosecuted his inquiry with vigour; for the experiments with magnesia\r\nare soon after mentioned.\r\n\r\nThese experiments laid open the whole mystery, as appears by another\r\nmemorandum. “When I precipitate lime by a common alkali there is no\r\neffervescence: the air quits the alkali for the lime; but it is lime no\r\nlonger, but C. C. C.: it now effervesces, which good lime will not.”\r\nWhat a multitude of important consequences naturally flowed from this\r\ndiscovery! He now knew to what the causticity of alkalies is owing,\r\nand how to induce it or remove it at pleasure. The common notion was\r\nentirely reversed. Lime imparts nothing to the alkalies; it only\r\nremoves from them a peculiar kind of air (_carbonic acid gas_) with\r\nwhich they were combined, and which prevented their natural caustic\r\nproperties from being developed. All the former mysteries disappear,\r\nand the greatest simplicity appears in those operations of nature which\r\nbefore appeared so intricate and obscure.\r\n\r\nDr. Black had fixed upon this subject for his inaugural dissertation,\r\nand was induced, in consequence, to defer applying for his degree till\r\nhe had succeeded in establishing his doctrine beyond the possibility of\r\ncontradiction. The inaugural essay was delivered at a moment peculiarly\r\nfavourable to the advancement of science. Dr. Cullen had been just\r\nremoved to Edinburgh, and there was a vacancy in the chemical chair\r\nin Glasgow: it could not be bestowed better than on such an _alumnus_\r\nof the university--on one who had distinguished himself both as a\r\nchemist and an excellent reasoner; for few finer models of inductive\r\ninvestigation exist than are displayed in Black’s essay on quicklime\r\nand magnesia. He was appointed professor of anatomy and lecturer on\r\nchemistry in the University of Glasgow in 1756. It was a fortunate\r\ncircumstance both for himself and for the public, that a situation thus\r\npresented itself, just at the time when he was under the necessity of\r\nsettling in the world--a situation which allowed him to dedicate his\r\ntalents chiefly to the cultivation of chemistry, his favourite science.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Black took his degree in medicine, he sent some copies of his\r\nessay to his father at Bordeaux. A copy was given by the old gentleman\r\nto his friend, the President Montesquieu, who, after a few days called\r\non Mr. Black, and said to him, “Mr. Black, my very good friend, I\r\nrejoice with you; your son will be the honour of your name and family.”\r\nThis anecdote was told Professor John Robison by the brother of Dr.\r\nBlack.\r\n\r\nThus Dr. Black, while in Glasgow, taught at one and the same time two\r\ndifferent classes. He did not consider himself very well qualified to\r\nteach anatomy, but determined to do his utmost; but he soon afterwards\r\nmade arrangements with the professor of medicine, who, with the\r\nconcurrence of the university, exchanged his own chair for that of Dr.\r\nBlack.\r\n\r\nBlack’s medical lectures constituted his chief task while in\r\nGlasgow. They gave the greatest satisfaction by their perspicuity\r\nand simplicity, and by the cautious moderation of all his general\r\ndoctrines: and, indeed, all his perspicuity, and all his neatness\r\nof manner in exhibiting simple truths, were necessary to create a\r\nrelish for moderation and caution, after the brilliant prospects of\r\nsystematic knowledge to which the students had been accustomed by Dr.\r\nCullen, his celebrated predecessor. But Dr. Black had no wish to form\r\na medical school, distinguished by some all-comprehending doctrine: he\r\nsatisfied himself with a clear account of as much of physiology as he\r\nthought founded on good principles, and a short sketch of such general\r\ndoctrines as were maintained by the most eminent authors, though\r\nperhaps on a less firm foundation. He then endeavoured to deduce a few\r\ncanons of medical practice, and concluded with certain rules founded\r\non successful practice only, but not deducible from the principles of\r\nphysiology previously laid down. With his medical lectures he does not\r\nappear to have been himself entirely satisfied: he did not encourage\r\nconversation on the different topics, and no remains of these lectures\r\nwere to be found among his papers. The preceding account of them was\r\ngiven to Professor Robison by a surgeon in Glasgow, who attended the\r\ntwo last medical courses which Dr. Black ever delivered.\r\n\r\nDr. Black’s reception at Glasgow by the university was in the highest\r\ndegree encouraging. His former conduct as a student had not only done\r\nhim credit in his classes, but had conciliated the affection of the\r\nprofessors to a very high degree. He became immediately connected\r\nin the strictest friendship with the celebrated Dr. Adam Smith--a\r\nfriendship which continued intimate and confidential through the\r\nwhole of their lives. Both were remarkable for a certain simplicity\r\nof character and the most incorruptible integrity. Dr. Smith used to\r\nsay, that no one had less nonsense in his head than Dr. Black; and he\r\noften acknowledged himself obliged to him for setting him right in his\r\njudgment of character, confessing that he himself was too apt to form\r\nhis opinion from a single feature.\r\n\r\nIt was during his residence in Glasgow, between the years 1759 and\r\n1763, that he brought to maturity those speculations concerning the\r\ncombination of _heat_ with _matter_, which had frequently occupied\r\na portion of his thoughts. It had long been known that ice has the\r\nproperty of continuing always at the temperature of 32° till it be\r\nmelted. This happens equally though it be placed in contact with the\r\nwarm hand or surrounded with bodies many degrees hotter than itself.\r\nThe hotter the bodies are that surround it, the sooner is it melted;\r\nbut its temperature during the whole process of melting, continues\r\nuniformly the same. Yet, during the whole process of melting, it is\r\nconstantly robbing the surrounding bodies of heat; for it makes them\r\ncolder, without acquiring itself any sensible heat.\r\n\r\nDr. Black had some vague notion that the heat so received by the ice,\r\nduring its conversion into water, was not lost, but was contained in\r\nthe water. This opinion was founded chiefly on a curious observation\r\nof Fahrenheit, recorded by Boerhaave; namely, that water might in some\r\ncases be made considerably colder than melting snow, without freezing.\r\nIn such cases, when disturbed it would freeze in a moment, and in the\r\nact of freezing always gave out a quantity of heat. This opinion was\r\nconfirmed by observing the slowness with which water is converted\r\ninto ice, and ice into water. A fine winter-day of sunshine is never\r\nsufficient to clear the hills of snow; nor is one frosty night capable\r\nof covering the ponds with a thick coating of ice. The phenomena\r\nsatisfied him that much heat was absorbed and fixed in the water which\r\ntrickles from wreaths of snow, and that much heat emerged from it while\r\nwater was slowly converted into ice; for during a thaw the melting snow\r\nis always colder than the air, and must, therefore, be always receiving\r\nheat from it; while, during a frost, the air is always colder than the\r\nfreezing water, and must therefore be always receiving heat from it.\r\nThese observations, and many others which it is needless to state,\r\nsatisfied Dr. Black that when ice is converted into water it unites\r\nwith a quantity of heat, without increasing in temperature; and that\r\nwhen water is frozen into ice it gives out a quantity of heat without\r\ndiminishing in temperature. The heat thus combined is the cause of the\r\nfluidity of the water. As it is not sensible to the thermometer, Dr.\r\nBlack called it _latent heat_. He made an experiment to determine the\r\nquantity of heat necessary to convert ice into water. This he estimated\r\nby the length of time necessary to melt a given weight of ice,\r\nmeasuring how much heat entered into the same weight of water, reduced\r\nas nearly to the temperature of ice as possible during the first\r\nhalf-hour that the experiment lasted. As the ice continued during the\r\nwhole of its melting at the same temperature as at first, he concluded\r\nthat it would absorb, every half-hour that the process lasted, as much\r\nheat as the water did during the first half hour. The result of this\r\nexperiment was, that the latent heat of water amounts to 140°; or, in\r\nother words, that this heat, if thrown into a quantity of water, equal\r\nin weight to that of the ice melted, would raise its temperature 140°.\r\n\r\nDr. Black, having established this discovery in the most\r\nincontrovertible manner by simple and decisive experiments, drew up an\r\naccount of the whole investigation, and the doctrine which he founded\r\nupon it, and read it to a literary society which met every Friday in\r\nthe faculty-room of the college, consisting of the members of the\r\nuniversity and several gentlemen of the city, who had a relish for\r\nscience and literature. This paper was read on the 23d of April, as\r\nappears by the registers of the society.\r\n\r\nDr. Black quickly perceived the vast importance of this discovery, and\r\ntook a pleasure in laying before his students a view of the beneficial\r\neffects of this habitude of heat in the economy of nature. During the\r\nsummer season a vast magazine of heat was accumulated in the water,\r\nwhich, by gradually emerging during congelation, serves to temper the\r\ncold of winter. Were it not for this accumulation of heat in water and\r\nother bodies, the sun would no sooner go a few degrees to the south of\r\nthe equator, than we should feel all the horrors of winter. He did not\r\nconfine his views to the congelation of water alone, but extended them\r\nto every case of congelation and liquefaction which he has ascribed\r\nequally to the evolution or fixation of latent heat. Even those bodies\r\nwhich change from solid to fluid, not all at once, but by slow degrees,\r\nas butter, tallow, resins, owe, he found, their gradual softening to\r\nthe same absorption of heat, and the same combination of it with the\r\nsubstance undergoing liquefaction.\r\n\r\nAnother subject that engaged his attention at this time, was an\r\nexamination of the scale of the thermometer, to learn whether\r\nequal differences of expansion corresponded to equal additions or\r\nabstractions of heat. His mode was to mix together equal weights of\r\nwater of different temperatures, and to measure the temperature of the\r\nmixture by a thermometer. It is obvious that the temperature must be\r\nthe exact mean of that of the two portions of water; and that if the\r\nexpansion or contraction of the mercury in the thermometer be an exact\r\nmeasure of the difference of temperature, a thermometer, so placed,\r\nwill indicate the exact mean. Suppose one pound of water at 100° to\r\nbe mixed with one pound of water at 200°, and the whole heat still\r\nto remain in the mixture, it is obvious that it would divide itself\r\nequally between the two portions of water. The water of 100° would\r\nbecome hotter, and the water of 200° would become colder: and the\r\nincrease of temperature in the colder portion would be just as much\r\nas the diminution of temperature in the hotter portion. The colder\r\nportion would become hotter by 50°, while the hotter portion would\r\nbecome colder by 50°. Hence the real temperature, after mixture, would\r\nbe 150°; and a thermometer plunged into such a mixture, if a true\r\nmeasurer of heat, would indicate 150°. The result of his experiments\r\nwas, that as high up as he could try by mixing water of different\r\ntemperatures, the mercurial thermometer is an accurate measurer of the\r\nalterations of temperature.\r\n\r\nAn account of his experiments on this subject was drawn up by him, and\r\nread to the literary society of the College of Glasgow, on the 28th of\r\nMarch, 1760. Dr. Black, at the time he made these experiments, did not\r\nknow that he had been already anticipated in them by Dr. Brooke Taylor,\r\nthe celebrated mathematician, who had obtained similar results, and had\r\nconsigned his experiments to the Royal Society, in whose Transactions\r\nfor 1723 they were published. It has been since found by Coulomb\r\nand Petit, that at higher temperatures than 212° the rate of the\r\nexpansion of mercury begins to increase. Hence it happens that at high\r\ntemperatures the expansion of mercury is no longer an accurate measurer\r\nof temperature. Fortunately, the expansion of glass very nearly equals\r\nthe increment of that of mercury. The consequence is, that in a common\r\nglass-thermometer mercury measures the true increments of temperature\r\nvery nearly up to its boiling point; for the boiling point of mercury\r\nmeasured by an air-thermometer is 662°: and if a glass mercurial\r\nthermometer be plunged into boiling mercury, it will indicate 660°, a\r\ndifference of only 2° from the true point.\r\n\r\nThere is such an analogy between the cessation of thermometric\r\nexpansion during the liquefaction of ice, and during the conversion of\r\nwater into steam, that there could be no hesitation about explaining\r\nboth in the same way. Dr. Black immediately concluded that as water is\r\nice united to a certain quantity of _latent heat_, so steam is water\r\nunited to a still greater quantity. The slow conversion of water into\r\nsteam, notwithstanding the great quantity of heat constantly flowing\r\ninto it from the fire, left no reasonable doubt about the accuracy of\r\nthis conclusion. In short, all the phenomena are precisely similar to\r\nthose of the conversion of ice into water; and so, of course, must\r\nthe explanation be. So much was he convinced of this, that he taught\r\nthe doctrine in his lectures in 1761, before he had made a single\r\nexperiment on the subject; and he explained, with great felicity of\r\nargument, many phenomena of nature, which result from this vaporific\r\ncombination of heat. From notes taken in his class during this session,\r\nit appears that nothing more was wanting to complete his views on this\r\nsubject, than a set of experiments to determine the exact quantity\r\nof heat which was combined in steam in a state not indicated by the\r\nthermometer, and therefore _latent_, in the same sense that the heat of\r\nliquefaction in water is _latent_.\r\n\r\nThe requisite experiments were first attempted by Dr. Black, in 1764.\r\nThey consisted merely in measuring the time requisite to convert a\r\ncertain weight of water of a given temperature into steam. The water\r\nwas put into a tin-plate wide-mouthed vessel, and laid upon a red-hot\r\nplate of iron, the initial temperature of the water was marked, and the\r\ntime necessary to heat it from that point to the boiling point noted,\r\nand then the time requisite to boil the whole to dryness. It was taken\r\nfor granted that as much heat would enter into the water during every\r\nminute that the experiment lasted, as did during the first minute. From\r\nthis it was concluded that the latent heat of steam is not less than\r\n810 degrees.\r\n\r\nMr. James Watt afterwards repeated these experiments with a better\r\napparatus and very great care, and calculated from his results that the\r\nlatent heat of steam is not under 950 degrees. Lavoisier and Laplace\r\nafterwards made experiments in a different way, and deduced 1000° as\r\nthe result of their experiments. The subsequent experiments of Count\r\nRumford, made in a very ingenious manner, so as to obviate most of the\r\nsources of error, to which such researches are liable, come very nearly\r\nto those of Lavoisier. 1000° therefore, is usually now-a-days adopted\r\nas the number which denotes the true latent heat of steam.\r\n\r\nDr. Black continued in the University of Glasgow from 1756 to 1766,\r\nmuch esteemed as an eminent professor, much employed as an able and\r\nattentive physician, and much beloved as an amiable and accomplished\r\nman, happy in the enjoyment of a small but select society of friends.\r\nMeanwhile his reputation as a chemical philosopher was every day\r\nincreasing, and pupils from foreign countries carried home with them\r\nthe peculiar doctrines of his courses--so that _fixed air_ and _latent\r\nheat_ began to be spoken of among the naturalists of the continent. In\r\n1766 Dr. Cullen, at that time professor of chemistry in Edinburgh, was\r\nappointed professor of medicine, and thus a vacancy was made in the\r\nchemical chair of that university. There was but one wish with regard\r\nto a successor. Indeed, when the vacancy happened in 1756, on the death\r\nof Dr. Plummer, the reputation of Dr. Black, who had just taken his\r\ndegree, was so high, both as a chemist and an accurate thinker and\r\nreasoner, that, had the choice depended on the university, he would\r\nhave been the new professor of chemistry. He had now, in 1766, greatly\r\nadded to his claim of merit by his important discovery of latent heat;\r\nand he had acquired the esteem of all by the singular moderation and\r\nscrupulous caution which marked all his researches.\r\n\r\nDr. Black was appointed to the chemical chair in Edinburgh in 1766, to\r\nthe general satisfaction of the public, but the University of Glasgow\r\nsuffered an irreparable loss. In this new situation his talents were\r\nmore conspicuous and more extensively useful. He saw that the case was\r\nso, and while he could not but be gratified by the number of students\r\nwhom the high reputation of Edinburgh, as a medical school, brought\r\ntogether, his mind was forcibly struck by the importance of his duties\r\nas a teacher. This led him to form the resolution of devoting the\r\nwhole of his study to the improvement of his pupils in the elementary\r\nknowledge of chemistry. Many of them came to his class with a very\r\nscanty stock of previous knowledge. Many from the workshop of the\r\nmanufacturer had little or none. He was conscious that the number\r\nof this kind of pupils must increase with the increasing activity\r\nand prosperity of the country; and they appeared to him by no means\r\nthe least important part of his auditory. To engage the attention of\r\nsuch pupils, and to be perfectly understood by the most illiterate\r\nof his audience, Dr. Black considered as a sacred duty: he resolved,\r\ntherefore, that plain doctrines taught in the plainest manner, should\r\nhenceforth employ his chief study. To render his lectures perfectly\r\nintelligible they were illustrated by suitable experiments, by the\r\nexhibition of specimens, and by the repetition of chemical processes.\r\n\r\nTo this method of lecturing Dr. Black rigidly adhered, endeavouring\r\nevery year to make his courses more plain and familiar, and\r\nillustrating them by a greater variety of examples in the way of\r\nexperiment. No man could perform these more neatly or successfully;\r\nthey were always ingeniously and judiciously contrived, clearly\r\nestablishing the point in view, and were never more complicated than\r\nwas sufficient for the purpose. Nothing that had the least appearance\r\nof quackery; nothing calculated to surprise and astonish his audience;\r\nnothing savouring of a showman or sleight-of-hand man was ever\r\npermitted in his lecture-room. Every thing was simple, neat, and\r\nelegant, calculated equally to please and to inform: indeed simplicity\r\nand neatness stamped his character. It was this that constituted the\r\ncharm of his lectures, and rendered them so delightful to his pupils.\r\nI can speak of them from experience, for I was fortunate enough to\r\nhear the last course of lectures which he ever delivered. I can say\r\nwith perfect truth that I never listened to any lectures with so\r\nmuch pleasure as to his: and it was the elegant simplicity of his\r\nmanner, the perfect clearness of his statements, and the vast quantity\r\nof information which he contrived in this way to communicate, that\r\ndelighted me. I was all at once transported into a new world--my views\r\nwere suddenly enlarged, and I looked down from a height which I had\r\nnever before reached; and all this knowledge was communicated without\r\nany apparent effort either on the part of the professor or his pupils.\r\nHis illustrations were just sufficient to answer completely the object\r\nin view, and nothing more. No quackery, no trickery, no love of mere\r\ndazzle and glitter, ever had the least influence upon his conduct. He\r\nconstituted the most complete model of a perfect chemical lecturer that\r\nI have ever had an opportunity of witnessing.\r\n\r\nThe discovery which Dr. Black had made that marble is a combination\r\nof lime and a peculiar substance, to which he gave the name of _fixed\r\nair_, began gradually to attract the attention of chemists in other\r\nparts of the world. It was natural in the first place to examine the\r\nnature and properties of this fixed air, and the circumstances under\r\nwhich it is generated. It may seem strange and unaccountable that Dr.\r\nBlack did not enter with ardour into this new career which he had\r\nhimself opened, and that he allowed others to reap the corn after\r\nhaving himself sown the grain. Yet he did take some steps towards\r\nascertaining the properties of _fixed air_; though I am not certain\r\nwhat progress he made. He knew that a candle would not burn in it,\r\nand that it is destructive to life, when any living animal attempts\r\nto breathe it. He knew that it was formed in the lungs during the\r\nbreathing of animals, and that it is generated during the fermentation\r\nof wine and beer. Whether he was aware that it possesses the properties\r\nof an acid I do not know; though with the knowledge which he possessed\r\nthat it combines with alkalies and alkaline earths, and neutralizes\r\nthem, or at least blunts and diminishes their alkaline properties,\r\nthe conclusion that it partook of alkaline properties was scarcely\r\navoidable. All these, and probably some other properties of _fixed air_\r\nhe was in the constant habit of stating in his lectures from the very\r\ncommencement of his academical career; though, as he never published\r\nanything on the subject himself, it is not possible to know exactly\r\nhow far his knowledge of the properties of _fixed air_ extended. The\r\noldest manuscript copy of his lectures that I have seen was taken\r\ndown in writing in the year 1773; and before that time Mr. Cavendish\r\nhad published his paper on _fixed air_ and _hydrogen gas_, and had\r\ndetailed the properties of each. It was impossible from the manuscript\r\nof Dr. Black’s lectures to know which of the properties of _fixed air_\r\nstated by him were discovered by himself, and which were taken from Mr.\r\nCavendish.\r\n\r\nThis languor and listlessness, on the part of Dr. Black, is chiefly to\r\nbe ascribed to the delicate state of his health, which precluded much\r\nexertion, and was particularly inconsistent with any attempt at putting\r\nhis thoughts down upon paper. Hence, probably, that carelessness\r\nabout posthumous fame, and that regardlessness of reputation, which,\r\nhowever it may be accounted for from bodily ailment, must still be\r\nconsidered as a blemish. How differently did Paschal act in a similar\r\nstate of health! With what energy did he exert himself in spite of\r\nbodily ailment! But the tone of his mind was quite different from that\r\nof Dr. Black. Gentleness, diffidence, and perhaps even slowness of\r\napprehension, were the characteristic features by which the latter was\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nThere is an anecdote of Black which I was told by the late Mr. Benjamin\r\nBell, of Edinburgh, author of a well-known system of surgery, and\r\nhe assured me that he had it from the late Sir George Clarke, of\r\nPennicuik, who was a witness of the circumstance related. Soon after\r\nthe appearance of Mr. Cavendish’s paper on hydrogen gas, in which he\r\nmade an approximation to the specific gravity of that body, showing\r\nthat it was at least ten times lighter than common air, Dr. Black\r\ninvited a party of his friends to supper, informing them that he had\r\na curiosity to show them. Dr. Hutton, Mr. Clarke of Elden, and Sir\r\nGeorge Clarke of Pennicuik, were of the number. When the company\r\ninvited had assembled, he took them into a room. He had the allentois\r\nof a calf filled with hydrogen gas, and upon setting it at liberty,\r\nit immediately ascended, and adhered to the ceiling. The phenomenon\r\nwas easily accounted for: it was taken for granted that a small black\r\nthread had been attached to the allentois, that this thread passed\r\nthrough the ceiling, and that some one in the apartment above, by\r\npulling the thread, elevated it to the ceiling, and kept it in this\r\nposition. This explanation was so probable, that it was acceded to\r\nby the whole company; though, like many other plausible theories, it\r\nturned out wholly unfounded; for when the allentois was brought down no\r\nthread whatever was found attached to it. Dr. Black explained the cause\r\nof the ascent to his admiring friends; but such was his carelessness\r\nof his own reputation, and of the information of the public, that he\r\nnever gave the least account of this curious experiment even to his\r\nclass; and more than twelve years elapsed before this obvious property\r\nof hydrogen gas was applied to the elevation of air-balloons, by M.\r\nCharles, in Paris.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Dr. Black had always been exceedingly delicate. The\r\nslightest cold, the most trifling approach to repletion, immediately\r\naffected his chest, occasioned feverishness, and if the disorder\r\ncontinued for two or three days, brought on a spitting of blood.\r\nIn this situation, nothing restored him to ease, but relaxation of\r\nthought, and gentle exercise. The sedentary life to which study\r\nconfined him, was manifestly hurtful; and he never allowed himself to\r\nindulge in any investigation that required intense thought, without\r\nfinding these complaints increased.\r\n\r\nThus situated, Dr. Black was obliged to be a contented spectator of the\r\nrapid progress which chemistry was making, without venturing himself to\r\nengage in any of the numerous investigations which presented themselves\r\non every side. Such indeed was the eagerness with which chemistry was\r\nat that time prosecuted, and such the passion for discovery, that there\r\nwas some risk that his undoubted claim to originality and priority\r\nin his own great discoveries, might be called in question, and even\r\nrendered doubtful. His friends at least were afraid of this, and often\r\nurged him to do justice to himself, by publishing an account of his\r\nown discoveries. He more than once began the task; but was so nice in\r\nhis notions of the manner in which it should be executed, that the\r\npains he took in forming a plan of the work never failed to affect\r\nhis health, and oblige him to desist. It is known that he felt hurt\r\nat the publication of several of Lavoisier’s papers, in the Mémoires\r\nde l’Académie, without any allusion whatever to what he himself had\r\npreviously done on the same subject. How far Lavoisier was really\r\nculpable, and whether he did not intend to do full justice to all the\r\nclaims of his predecessors, cannot now be known; as he was cut off\r\nin the midst of his career, while so many of his scientific projects\r\nremained unexecuted. From the posthumous works of Lavoisier, there\r\nis some reason for believing that if he had lived, he would have\r\ndone justice to all parties; but there is no doubt that Dr. Black,\r\nin the mean time, thought himself aggrieved, and that he formed the\r\nintention of doing himself justice, by publishing an account of his own\r\ndiscoveries; however this intention was thwarted and prevented by bad\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nNo one contributed more largely to establish, to support, and to\r\nincrease, the high character of the medical school in the University\r\nof Edinburgh than Dr. Black. His talent for communicating knowledge\r\nwas not less eminent than his faculty of observation. He soon became\r\none of the principal ornaments of the university; and his lectures\r\nwere attended by an audience which continued increasing from year to\r\nyear for more than thirty years. His personal appearance and manners\r\nwere those of a gentleman, and peculiarly pleasing: his voice, in\r\nlecturing, was low, but fine; and his articulation so distinct, that he\r\nwas perfectly well heard by an audience consisting of several hundreds.\r\nWhile in Glasgow, he had practised extensively as a physician; but in\r\nEdinburgh he declined general practice, and confined his attendance to\r\na few families of intimate and respected friends. He was, however, a\r\nphysician of good repute in a place where the character of a physician\r\nimplied no common degree of liberality, propriety, and dignity of\r\nmanners, as well as of learning and skill.\r\n\r\nSuch was Dr. Black as a public man. While young, his countenance was\r\ncomely and interesting; and as he advanced in years, it continued to\r\npreserve that pleasing expression of inward satisfaction which, by\r\ngiving ease to the beholder, never fails to please. His manners were\r\nsimple, unaffected, and graceful; he was of the most easy approach,\r\naffable, and readily entered into conversation, whether serious\r\nor trivial: for he was not merely a man of science, but was well\r\nacquainted with the elegant accomplishments. He had an accurate musical\r\near, and a voice which would obey it in the most perfect manner; he\r\nsang and performed on the flute with great taste and feeling; and could\r\nsing a plain air at sight, which many instrumental performers cannot\r\ndo. Music was his amusement in Glasgow; after his removal to Edinburgh\r\nhe gave it up entirely. Without having studied drawing he had acquired\r\na considerable power of expression with his pencil, both in figures\r\nand in landscape. He was peculiarly happy in expressing the passions,\r\nand seemed in this respect to have the talents of a historical\r\npainter. Figure indeed, of every kind, attracted his attention; in\r\narchitecture, furniture, ornament of every sort, it was never a matter\r\nof indifference to him. Even a retort, or a crucible, was to his eye\r\nan example of beauty, or deformity. These are not indifferent things;\r\nthey are features of an elegant mind, and they account for some part of\r\nthat satisfaction and pleasure which persons of different habits and\r\npursuits felt in Dr. Black’s company and conversation.\r\n\r\nThose circumstances of form, and in which Dr. Black perceived or sought\r\nfor beauty, were suitableness or propriety: something that rendered\r\nthem well adapted for the purposes for which they were intended. This\r\nlove of propriety constituted the leading feature in Dr. Black’s mind;\r\nit was the standard to which he constantly appealed, and which he\r\nendeavoured to make the directing principle of his conduct.\r\n\r\nDr. Black was fond of society, and felt himself beloved in it. His\r\nchief companions, in the earlier part of his residence in Edinburgh,\r\nwere Dr. Adam Smith, Mr. David Hume, Dr. Adam Ferguson, Mr. John Home,\r\nDr. Alexander Carlisle, and a few others. Mr. Clarke of Elden, and his\r\nbrother Sir George, Dr. Roebuck, and Dr. James Hutton, particularly\r\nthe latter, were affectionately attached to him, and in their society\r\nhe could indulge in his professional studies. Dr. Hutton was the\r\nonly person near him to whom Dr. Black imparted every speculation in\r\nchemical science, and who knew all his literary labours: seldom were\r\nthe two friends asunder for two days together.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the eighteenth century, the infirmities of\r\nadvanced life began to bear more heavily on his feeble constitution.\r\nThose hours of walking and gentle exercise, which had hitherto\r\nbeen necessary for his ease, were gradually curtailed. Company and\r\nconversation began to fatigue: he went less abroad, and was visited\r\nonly by his intimate friends. His duty at college became too heavy for\r\nhim, and he got an assistant, who took a share of the lectures, and\r\nrelieved him from the fatigue of the experiments. The last course of\r\nlectures which he delivered was in the winter of 1796-7. After this,\r\neven lecturing was too much for his diminished strength, and he was\r\nobliged to absent himself from the class altogether; but he still\r\nretained his usual affability of temper, and his habitual cheerfulness,\r\nand even to the very last was accustomed to walk out and take\r\noccasional exercise. As his strength declined, his constitution became\r\nmore and more delicate. Every cold he caught occasioned some degree of\r\nspitting of blood; yet he seemed to have this unfortunate disposition\r\nof body almost under command, so that he never allowed it to proceed\r\nfar, or to occasion any distressing illness. He spun his thread of\r\nlife to the very last fibre. He guarded against illness by restricting\r\nhimself to an abstemious diet; and he met his increasing infirmities\r\nwith a proportional increase of attention and care, regulating his food\r\nand exercise by the measure of his strength. Thus he made the most of a\r\nfeeble constitution, by preventing the access of disease from abroad.\r\nAnd enjoyed a state of health which was feeble, indeed, but scarcely\r\ninterrupted; as well as a mind undisturbed in the calm and cheerful use\r\nof its faculties. His only apprehension was that of a long-continued\r\nsick-bed--from the humane consideration of the trouble and distress\r\nthat he might thus occasion to attending friends; and never was such\r\ngenerous wish more completely gratified than in his case.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of November, 1799, in the seventy-first year of his age, he\r\nexpired without any convulsion, shock, or stupor, to announce or retard\r\nthe approach of death. Being at table with his usual fare, some bread,\r\na few prunes, and a measured quantity of milk, diluted with water,\r\nand having the cup in his hand when the last stroke of his pulse was\r\nto be given, he set it down on his knees, which were joined together,\r\nand kept it steady with his hand in the manner of a person perfectly\r\nat ease; and in this attitude expired without spilling a drop, and\r\nwithout a writhe in his countenance; as if an experiment had been\r\nrequired to show to his friends the facility with which he departed.\r\nHis servant opened the door to tell him that some one had left his\r\nname; but getting no answer, stepped about halfway to him; and seeing\r\nhim sitting in that easy posture, supporting his basin of milk with one\r\nhand, he thought that he had dropped asleep, which was sometimes wont\r\nto happen after meals. He went back and shut the door; but before he\r\ngot down stairs some anxiety, which he could not account for, made him\r\nreturn and look again at his master. Even then he was satisfied, after\r\ncoming pretty near him, and turned to go away; but he again returned,\r\nand coming close up to him, he found him without life. His very near\r\nneighbour, Mr. Benjamin Bell, the surgeon, was immediately sent for;\r\nbut nothing whatever could be done.[185]\r\n\r\n[185] The preceding character of Dr. Black is from Professor Robison,\r\nwho knew him intimately; and from Dr. Adam Ferguson, who was his next\r\nrelation. See the preface to Dr. Black’s lectures. The portrait of Dr.\r\nBlack prefixed to these lectures is an excellent likeness.\r\n\r\nDr. Black’s writings are exceedingly few, consisting altogether of\r\nno more than three papers. The first, entitled “Experiments upon\r\nMagnesia alba, Quicklime, and other Alkaline Substances,” constituted\r\nthe subject of his inaugural dissertation. It afterwards appeared\r\nin an English dress in one of the volumes of The Edinburgh Physical\r\nand Literary Essays, in the year 1755. Mr. Creech, the bookseller,\r\npublished it in a separate pamphlet, together with Dr. Cullen’s\r\nlittle essay on the “cold produced by evaporating fluids,” in the\r\nyear 1796. This essay exhibits one of the very finest examples of\r\ninductive reasoning to be found in the English language. The author\r\nshows that magnesia is a peculiar earthy body, possessed of properties\r\nvery different from lime. He gives the properties of lime in a pure\r\nstate, and proves that it differs from limestone merely by the absence\r\nof the carbonic acid, which is a constituent of limestone. Limestone\r\nis a _carbonate of lime_; quicklime is the pure uncombined earth. He\r\nshows that magnesia has also the property of combining with carbonic\r\nacid; that caustic potash, or soda, is merely these bodies in a pure\r\nor isolated state; while the mild alkalies are combinations of these\r\nbodies with carbonic acid. The reason why quicklime converts mild\r\ninto caustic alkali is, that the lime has a stronger affinity for\r\nthe carbonic acid than the alkali; hence the lime is converted into\r\ncarbonate of lime, and the alkali, deprived of its carbonic acid,\r\nbecomes caustic. Mild potash is a carbonate of potash; caustic potash,\r\nis potash freed from carbonic acid.--The publication of this essay\r\noccasioned a controversy in Germany, which was finally settled by\r\nJacquin and Lavoisier, who repeated Dr. Black’s experiments and showed\r\nthem to be correct.\r\n\r\nDr. Black’s second paper was published in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions for 1775. It is entitled “The supposed Effect of boiling\r\non Water, in disposing it to freeze more readily, ascertained by\r\nExperiments.” He shows, that when water that has been recently boiled\r\nis exposed to cold air, it begins to freeze as soon as it reaches the\r\nfreezing point; while water that has not been boiled may be cooled some\r\ndegrees below the freezing point before it begins to congeal. But if\r\nthe unboiled water be constantly stirred during the whole time of its\r\nexposure, it begins to freeze when cooled down to the freezing point as\r\nwell as the other. He shows that the difference between the two waters\r\nconsists in this, that the boiled water is constantly absorbing air,\r\nwhich disturbs it, whereas the other water remains in a state of rest.\r\n\r\nHis last paper was “An Analysis of the Water of some boiling Springs\r\nin Iceland,” published in the Transactions of the Royal Society of\r\nEdinburgh. This was the water of the Geyser spring, brought from\r\nIceland by Sir J. Stanley. Dr. Black found it to contain a great deal\r\nof silica, held in solution in the water by caustic soda.\r\n\r\nThe tempting career which Dr. Black opened, and which he was unable to\r\nprosecute for want of health, soon attracted the attention of one of\r\nthe ablest men that Great Britain has produced--I mean Mr. Cavendish.\r\n\r\nThe Honourable Henry Cavendish was born in London on the 10th of\r\nOctober, 1731: his father was Lord Charles Cavendish, a cadet of the\r\nhouse of Devonshire, one of the oldest families in England. During his\r\nfather’s lifetime he was kept in rather narrow circumstances, being\r\nallowed an annuity of £500 only; while his apartments were a set of\r\nstables, fitted up for his accommodation. It was during this period\r\nthat he acquired those habits of economy, and those singular oddities\r\nof character, which he exhibited ever after in so striking a manner. At\r\nhis father’s death he was left a very considerable fortune; and an aunt\r\nwho died at a later period bequeathed him a very handsome addition to\r\nit; but, in consequence of the habits of economy which he had acquired,\r\nit was not in his power to spend the greater part of his annual income.\r\nThis occasioned a yearly increase to his capital, till at last it\r\naccumulated so much, without any care on his part, that at the period\r\nof his death he left behind him nearly £1,300,000; and he was at that\r\ntime the greatest proprietor of stock in the Bank of England.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, the money in the hands of his bankers had accumulated\r\nto the amount of £70,000. These gentlemen thinking it improper to keep\r\nso large a sum in their hands, sent one of the partners to wait upon\r\nhim, in order to learn how he desired it disposed of. This gentleman\r\nwas admitted; and, after employing the necessary precautions to a man\r\nof Mr. Cavendish’s peculiar disposition, stated the circumstance, and\r\nbegged to know whether it would not be proper to lay out the money at\r\ninterest. Mr. Cavendish dryly answered, “You may lay it out if you\r\nplease,” and left the room.\r\n\r\nHe hardly ever went into any other society than that of his scientific\r\nfriends: he never was absent from the weekly dinner of the Royal\r\nSociety club at the Crown and Anchor Tavern in the Strand. At these\r\ndinners, when he happened to be seated near those that he liked, he\r\noften conversed a great deal; though at other times he was very silent.\r\nHe was likewise a constant attendant at Sir Joseph Banks’s Sunday\r\nevening meetings. He had a house in London, which he only visited\r\nonce or twice a-week at stated times, and without ever speaking to\r\nthe servants: it contained an excellent library, to which he gave all\r\nliterary men the freest and most unrestrained access. But he lived\r\nin a house on Clapham Common, where he scarcely ever received any\r\nvisitors. His relation, Lord George Cavendish, to whom he left by will\r\nthe greatest part of his fortune, visited him only once a-year, and the\r\nvisit hardly ever exceeded ten or twelve minutes.\r\n\r\nHe was shy and bashful to a degree bordering on disease; he could not\r\nbear to have any person introduced to him, or to be pointed out in any\r\nway as a remarkable man. One Sunday evening he was standing at Sir\r\nJoseph Banks’s in a crowded room, conversing with Mr. Hatchett, when\r\nDr. Ingenhousz, who had a good deal of pomposity of manner, came up\r\nwith an Austrian gentleman in his hand, and introduced him formally to\r\nMr. Cavendish. He mentioned the titles and qualifications of his friend\r\nat great length, and said that he had been peculiarly anxious to be\r\nintroduced to a philosopher so profound and so universally known and\r\ncelebrated as Mr. Cavendish. As soon as Dr. Ingenhousz had finished,\r\nthe Austrian gentleman began, and assured Mr. Cavendish that his\r\nprincipal reason for coming to London was to see and converse with one\r\nof the greatest ornaments of the age, and one of the most illustrious\r\nphilosophers that ever existed. To all these high-flown speeches Mr.\r\nCavendish answered not a word, but stood with his eyes cast down quite\r\nabashed and confounded. At last, spying an opening in the crowd, he\r\ndarted through it with all the speed of which he was master; nor did he\r\nstop till he reached his carriage, which drove him directly home.\r\n\r\nOf a man, whose habits were so retired, and whose intercourse with\r\nsociety was so small, there is nothing else to relate except his\r\nscientific labours: the current of his life passed on with the utmost\r\nregularity; the description of a single day would convey a correct idea\r\nof his whole existence. At one time he was in the habit of keeping\r\nan individual to assist him in his experiments. This place was for\r\nsome time filled by Sir Charles Blagden; but they did not agree well\r\ntogether, and after some time Sir Charles left him. Mr. Cavendish died\r\non the 4th of February, 1810, aged seventy-eight years, four months,\r\nand six days. When he found himself dying, he gave directions to his\r\nservant to leave him alone, and not to return till a certain time which\r\nhe specified, and by which period he expected to be no longer alive.\r\nThe servant, however, who was aware of the state of his master, and\r\nwas anxious about him, opened the door of the room before the time\r\nspecified, and approached the bed to take a look at the dying man. Mr.\r\nCavendish, who was still sensible, was offended at the intrusion, and\r\nordered him out of the room with a voice of displeasure, commanding him\r\nnot by any means to return till the time specified. When he did come\r\nback at that time, he found his master dead. What a contrast between\r\nthe characters of Mr. Cavendish and Dr. Black!\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Mr. Cavendish did not much prepossess strangers in\r\nhis favour; he was somewhat above the middle size, his body rather\r\nthick, and his neck rather short. He stuttered a little in his speech,\r\nwhich gave him an air of awkwardness: his countenance was not strongly\r\nmarked, so as to indicate the profound abilities which he possessed.\r\nThis was probably owing to the total absence of all the violent\r\npassions. His education seems to have been very complete; he was an\r\nexcellent mathematician, a profound electrician, and a most acute\r\nand ingenious chemist. He never ventured to give an opinion on any\r\nsubject, unless he had studied it to the bottom. He appeared before\r\nthe world first as a chemist, and afterwards as an electrician. The\r\nwhole of his literary labours consist of eighteen papers, published\r\nin the Philosophical Transactions, which, though they occupy only a\r\nfew pages, are full of the most important discoveries and the most\r\nprofound investigations. Of these papers, there are ten which treat\r\nof chemical subjects, two treat of electricity, two of meteorology,\r\nthree are connected with astronomy, and there is one, the last which\r\nhe wrote, which gives his method of dividing astronomical instruments.\r\nOf the papers in question, those alone which treat of Chemistry can be\r\nanalyzed in a work like this.\r\n\r\n1. His first paper, entitled, “Experiments on fictitious Air,” was\r\npublished in the year 1766, when Mr. Cavendish was thirty-five years\r\nof age. Dr. Hales had demonstrated (as had previously been done by\r\nVan Helmont and Glauber) that _air_ is given out by a vast number of\r\nbodies in peculiar circumstances. But he never suspected that any of\r\nthe _airs_ which he obtained differed from common air. Indeed common\r\nair had always been considered as an elementary substance to which\r\nevery elastic fluid was referred. Dr. Black had shown that the mild\r\nalkalies and limestone, and carbonate of magnesia, were combinations\r\nof these bodies with a gaseous substance, to which he had given\r\nthe name of _fixed air_; and he had pointed out various methods of\r\ncollecting this fixed air; though he himself had not made much progress\r\nin investigating its properties. This paper of Mr. Cavendish may be\r\nconsidered as a continuation of the investigations begun by Dr. Black.\r\nHe shows that there exist two species of air quite different in their\r\nproperties from common air: and he calls them _inflammable air_ and\r\n_fixed air_.\r\n\r\nInflammable air (hydrogen gas) is evolved when iron, zinc, or tin,\r\nare dissolved in dilute sulphuric or muriatic acid. Iron yielded\r\nabout 1-22d part of its weight, of inflammable air, zinc about\r\n1-23d or 1-24th of its weight, and tin about 1-44th of its weight.\r\nThe properties of the inflammable air were the same, whichever of\r\nthe three metals was used to procure it, and whether they were\r\ndissolved in sulphuric or muriatic acids. When the sulphuric acid was\r\nconcentrated, iron and zinc dissolved in it with difficulty and only\r\nby the assistance of heat. The air given out was not inflammable, but\r\nconsisted of sulphurous acid. These facts induced Mr. Cavendish to\r\nconclude that the inflammable air evolved in the first case was the\r\nunaltered _phlogiston_ of the metals, while the sulphurous acid evolved\r\nin the second case, was a compound of the same phlogiston and a portion\r\nof the acid, which deprived it of its inflammability. This opinion was\r\nvery different from that of Stahl, who considered combustible bodies as\r\ncompounds of phlogiston with acids or calces.\r\n\r\nCavendish found the specific gravity of his inflammable air about\r\neleven times less than that of common air. This determination is under\r\nthe truth; but the error is, at least in part, owing to the quantity\r\nof water held in solution by the air, and which, as Mr. Cavendish\r\nshowed, amounted to about 1-9th of the weight of the air. He tried\r\nthe combustibility of the inflammable air, when mixed with various\r\nproportions of common air, and found that it exploded with the greatest\r\nviolence when mixed with rather more than its bulk of common air.\r\n\r\nCopper he found, when dissolved in muriatic acid by the assistance of\r\nheat, yielded no inflammable air, but an air which lost its elasticity\r\nwhen it came in contact with water. This _air_, the nature of which Mr.\r\nCavendish did not examine, was _muriatic acid gas_, the properties of\r\nwhich were afterwards investigated by Dr. Priestley.\r\n\r\nThe _fixed air_ (_carbonic acid gas_) on which Mr. Cavendish made his\r\nexperiments was obtained by dissolving marble in muriatic acid. He\r\nfound that it might be kept over mercury for any length of time without\r\nundergoing any alteration; that it was gradually absorbed by cold\r\nwater; and that 100 measures of water of the temperature 55° absorbed\r\n103·8 measures of fixed air. The whole of the air thus absorbed was\r\nseparated again by exposing the water to a boiling heat, or by leaving\r\nit for sometime in an open vessel. Alcohol (the specific gravity not\r\nmentioned) absorbed 2¼ times its bulk of this air, and olive-oil about\r\n1-3d of its bulk.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of fixed air he found 1·57, that of common air\r\nbeing 1.[186] Fixed air is incapable of supporting combustion, and\r\ncommon air, when mixed with it, supports combustion a much shorter time\r\nthan when pure. A small wax taper burnt eighty seconds in a receiver\r\nwhich held 180 ounce measures, when filled with common air only. The\r\nsame taper burnt fifty-one seconds in the same receiver when filled\r\nwith a mixture of one volume fixed air, and nineteen volumes of common\r\nair. When the fixed air was 3-40ths of the whole volume the taper\r\nburnt twenty-three seconds. When the fixed air was 1-10th, the taper\r\nburnt eleven seconds. When it was 6-55ths or 1-9·16 of the whole\r\nmixture, the taper would not burn at all.\r\n\r\n[186] This I apprehend to be a little above the truth, the true\r\nspecific gravity of carbonic acid gas being 1·5277, that of air being\r\nunity.\r\n\r\nMr. Cavendish was of opinion that more than one kind of fixed air was\r\ngiven out by marble; in other words, that the elastic fluid emitted,\r\nconsisted of two different airs, one more absorbable by water than\r\nthe other. He drew his conclusion from the circumstance that after a\r\nsolution of potash had been exposed to a quantity of fixed air for\r\nsome time, it ceased to absorb any more; yet, if the residual portion\r\nof air were thrown away and new fixed air substituted in its place, it\r\nbegan to absorb again; but Mr. Dalton has since given a satisfactory\r\nexplanation of this seeming anomaly by showing that the absorbability\r\nof fixed air in water is proportional to its purity, and that when\r\nmixed with a great quantity of common air or any other gas not soluble\r\nin water, it ceases to be sensibly absorbed.\r\n\r\nMr. Cavendish ascertained the quantity of fixed air contained in\r\nmarble, carbonate of ammonia, common pearlashes, and carbonate of\r\npotash: but notwithstanding the care with which these experiments were\r\nmade they are of little value; because the proper precautions could not\r\nbe taken, in that infant state of chemical science, to have these salts\r\nin a state of purity. The following were the results obtained by Mr.\r\nCavendish:\r\n\r\n  1000 grains of marble contained 408 grs. fixed air.\r\n  1000   --   carb. of ammonia    533        --\r\n  1000   --   pearlashes          284        --\r\n  1000   --   carb. of potash     423        --\r\n\r\nSupposing the marble, carbonate of ammonia, and carbonate of potash, to\r\nhave been pure anhydrous simple salts, their composition would be\r\n\r\n  1000 grains of marble contain 440 grs. fixed air.\r\n  1000   --   carb. of ammonia  709·6      --\r\n  1000   --   carb. of potash   314·2      --\r\n\r\nBicarbonate of potash was first obtained by Dr. Black. Mr. Cavendish\r\nformed the salt by dissolving pearlashes in water, and passing a\r\ncurrent of carbonic acid gas through the solution till it deposited\r\ncrystals. These crystals were not altered by exposure to the air, did\r\nnot deliquesce, and were soluble in about four times their weight of\r\ncold water.\r\n\r\nDr. M’Bride had already ascertained that vegetable and animal\r\nsubstances yield fixed air by putrefaction and fermentation. Mr.\r\nCavendish found by experiment that sugar when dissolved in water\r\nand fermented, gives out 57-100ths of its weight of fixed air,\r\npossessing exactly the properties of fixed air from marble. During\r\nthe fermentation no air was absorbed, nor was any change induced on\r\nthe common air, at the surface of the fermenting liquor. Apple-juice\r\nfermented much faster than sugar; but the phenomena were the same,\r\nand the fixed air emitted amounted to 381/1000 of the weight of the\r\nsolid extract of apples. Gravy and raw meat yielded inflammable air\r\nduring their putrefaction, the former in much greater quantity than the\r\nlatter. This air, as far as Mr. Cavendish’s experiments went, he found\r\nthe same as the inflammable air from zinc by dilute sulphuric acid; but\r\nits specific gravity was a little higher.\r\n\r\nThis paper of Mr. Cavendish was the first attempt by chemists to\r\ncollect the different kinds of air, and endeavour to ascertain their\r\nnature. Hence all his processes were in some measure new: they served\r\nas a model to future experimenters, and were gradually brought to their\r\npresent state of simplicity and perfection. He was the first person\r\nwho attempted to determine the specific gravity of airs, by comparing\r\ntheir weight with that of the same bulk of common air; and though\r\nhis apparatus was defective, yet the principle was good, and is the\r\nvery same which is still employed to accomplish the same object. Mr.\r\nCavendish then first began the true investigation of gases, and in his\r\nfirst paper he determined the peculiar nature of two very remarkable\r\ngases, _carbonic_ and _hydrogen_.\r\n\r\n2. Mineral waters have at all times attracted the attention of the\r\nfaculty in consequence of their peculiar properties and medical\r\nvirtues. Some faint steps towards their investigation were taken by\r\nBoyle. Du Clos attempted a chemical analysis of the mineral waters in\r\nFrance; and Hierne made a similar investigation of the mineral waters\r\nof Sweden. Though these experiments were rude and inaccurate, they\r\nled to the knowledge of several facts respecting mineral waters which\r\nchemists were unable to explain. One of these was the existence of a\r\nconsiderable quantity of _calcareous earth_ in some mineral waters,\r\nwhich was precipitated by boiling. Nobody could conceive in what way\r\nthis insoluble substance (_carbonate of lime_) was held in solution,\r\nnor why it was thrown down when the water was raised to a boiling\r\nheat. It was to determine this point that Mr. Cavendish made his\r\nexperiments on Rathbone-place water, which were published in the year\r\n1767, and which may be considered as the first analysis of a mineral\r\nwater that possessed tolerable accuracy. Rathbone-place water was\r\nraised by a pump, and supplied the portion of London in its immediate\r\nneighbourhood. Mr. Cavendish found that when boiled, it deposited a\r\nquantity of earthy matter, consisting chiefly of lime, but containing\r\nalso a little magnesia. This he showed was held in solution by fixed\r\nair; and he proved experimentally, that when an excess of this gas\r\nis present, it has the property of holding lime and magnesia in\r\nsolution.[187] Besides these earthy carbonates, the water was found to\r\ncontain a little ammonia, some sulphate of lime, and some common salt.\r\nMr. Cavendish examined, likewise, some other pump-water in London, and\r\nshowed that it contained lime, held in solution by carbonic acid.\r\n\r\n[187] The salts held in solution are in the state of bicarbonates of\r\nlime and magnesia. Boiling drives off half the carbonic acid, and the\r\nsimple carbonates being insoluble are precipitated.\r\n\r\n3. Dr. Priestley, at a pretty early period of his chemical career,\r\nhad discovered that when nitrous gas is mixed with common air over\r\nwater, a diminution of bulk takes place; that there is a still greater\r\ndiminution of bulk when oxygen gas is employed instead of common\r\nair; and that the diminution is always proportional to the quantity\r\nof oxygen gas present in the gas mixed with the nitrous gas. This\r\ndiscovery induced him to employ nitrous gas as a test of the quantity\r\nof oxygen present in common air; and various instruments were contrived\r\nto facilitate the mixture of the gases, and the measurement of the\r\ndiminution of volume which took place. As the goodness of air, or its\r\nfitness to support combustion, and maintain animal life, was conceived\r\nto depend upon the proportion of oxygen gas which it contained, these\r\ninstruments were distinguished by the name of _eudiometers_; the\r\nsimplest of them was contrived by Fontana, and is usually distinguished\r\nby the name of the _eudiometer of Fontana_. Philosophers, in examining\r\nair by means of this instrument, at various seasons, and in various\r\nplaces, had found considerable differences in the diminution of\r\nbulk: hence they inferred that the proportion of oxygen varies in\r\ndifferent places; and to this variation they ascribed the healthiness\r\nor noxiousness of particular situations. For example, Dr. Ingenhousz\r\nhad found a greater proportion of oxygen in the air above the sea, and\r\non the sea-coast; and to this he ascribed the healthiness of maritime\r\nsituations. Mr. Cavendish examined this important point with his usual\r\npatient industry and acute discernment, and published the result in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions for 1783. He ascertained that the apparent\r\nvariations were owing to inaccuracies in making the experiment; and\r\nthat when the requisite precautions are taken, the proportion of oxygen\r\nin air is found constant in all places, and at all seasons. This\r\nconclusion has since been confirmed by numerous observations in every\r\npart of the globe. Mr. Cavendish also analyzed common air, and found it\r\nto consist of\r\n\r\n   79·16 volumes azotic gas,\r\n   20·84 volumes oxygen gas.\r\n  ------\r\n  100·00\r\n\r\n4. For many years it was the opinion of chemists that mercury is\r\nessentially liquid, and that no degree of cold is capable of congealing\r\nit. Professor Braun’s accidental discovery that it may be frozen by\r\ncold, like other liquids, was at first doubted; and when it was finally\r\nestablished by the most conclusive experiments, it was inferred from\r\nthe observations of Braun that the freezing point of mercury is several\r\nhundred degrees below zero on Fahrenheit’s scale. It became an object\r\nof great importance to determine the exact point of the congelation\r\nof this metal by accurate experiments. This was done at Hudson’s Bay,\r\nby Mr. Hutchins, who followed a set of directions given him by Mr.\r\nCavendish, and from his experiments Mr. Cavendish, in a paper inserted\r\nin the Philosophical Transactions for 1783, deduced that the freezing\r\npoint of mercury is 38·66 degrees below the zero of Fahrenheit’s\r\nthermometer.\r\n\r\n5. These experiments naturally drew the attention of Mr. Cavendish to\r\nthe phenomena of freezing, to the action of freezing mixtures, and the\r\ncongelation of acids. He employed Mr. M’Nab, who was settled in the\r\nneighbourhood of Hudson’s Bay, to make the requisite experiments; and\r\nhe published two very curious and important papers on these subjects\r\nin the Philosophical Transactions for 1786 and 1788. He explained the\r\nphenomena of congelation exactly according to the theory of Dr. Black,\r\nbut rejecting the hypothesis that heat is a _substance_ sui generis,\r\nand thinking it more probable, with Sir Isaac Newton, that it is\r\nowing to the rapid internal motion of the particles of the hot body.\r\nThe latent heat of water, he found to be 150°. The observations on the\r\ncongelation of nitric and sulphuric acids are highly interesting: he\r\nshowed that their freezing points vary considerably, according to the\r\nstrength of each; and drew up tables indicating the freezing points of\r\nacids, of various degrees of strength.\r\n\r\n6. But the most splendid and valuable of Mr. Cavendish’s chemical\r\nexperiments were published in two papers, entitled, “Experiments on\r\nAir,” in the Transactions of the Royal Society for 1784 and 1785. The\r\nobject of these experiments was to determine what happened during the\r\n_phlogistication of air_, as it was at that time termed; that is, the\r\nchange which air underwent when metals were calcined in contact with\r\nit, when sulphur or phosphorus was burnt in it, and in several similar\r\nprocesses. He showed, in the first place, that there was no reason for\r\nsupposing that carbonic acid was formed, except when some animal or\r\nvegetable substance was present; that when _hydrogen gas_ was burnt\r\nin contact with air or oxygen gas, it _combined_ with that gas, and\r\nformed _water_; that _nitrous gas_, by combining with the oxygen of the\r\natmosphere, formed _nitrous acid_; and that when _oxygen_ and _azotic_\r\ngas are mixed in the requisite proportions, and electric sparks passed\r\nthrough the mixture, they _combine_, and form _nitric_ acid.\r\n\r\nThe first of these opinions occasioned a controversy between Mr.\r\nCavendish, and Mr. Kirwan, who maintained that carbonic acid is always\r\nproduced when air is phlogisticated. Two papers on this subject by\r\nKirwan, and one by Cavendish, are inserted in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions for 1784, each remarkable examples of the peculiar manner\r\nof the respective writers. All the arguments of Kirwan are founded on\r\nthe experiments of others. He displays great reading, and a strong\r\nmemory; but does not discriminate between the merits of the chemists\r\non whose authority he founds his opinions. Mr. Cavendish, on the other\r\nhand, never advances a single opinion, which he has not put to the\r\ntest of experiment; and never suffers himself to go any further than\r\nhis experiment will warrant. Whatever is not accurately determined\r\nby unexceptionable trials, is merely stated as a conjecture on which\r\nlittle stress is laid.\r\n\r\nIn the first of these celebrated papers, Mr. Cavendish has drawn a\r\ncomparison between the phlogistic and antiphlogistic theories of\r\nchemistry; he has shown that each of them is capable of explaining\r\nthe phenomena in a satisfactory manner; though it is impossible to\r\ndemonstrate the truth of either; and he has given the reasons which\r\ninduced him to prefer the phlogistic theory--reasons which the French\r\nchemists were unable to refute, and which they were wise enough not\r\nto notice. There cannot be a more striking proof of the influence of\r\nfashion, even in science, and of the unwarrantable precipitation with\r\nwhich opinions are rejected or embraced by philosophers, than the total\r\ninattention paid by the chemical world to this admirable dissertation.\r\nHad Mr. Kirwan adopted the opinions of Mr. Cavendish, when he undertook\r\nthe defence of phlogiston, instead of trusting to the vague experiments\r\nof inaccurate chemists, he would not have been obliged to yield to his\r\nFrench antagonists, and the antiphlogistic theory would not so speedily\r\nhave gained ground.\r\n\r\nSuch is an epitome of the chemical papers of Mr. Cavendish. They\r\ncontain five notable discoveries; namely, 1. The nature and properties\r\nof hydrogen gas. 2. The solubility of bicarbonates of lime and magnesia\r\nin water. 3. The exact proportion of the constituents of common air. 4.\r\nThe composition of water. 5. The composition of nitric acid. It is to\r\nhim also that we are indebted for our knowledge of the freezing point\r\nof mercury; and he was likewise the first person who showed that potash\r\nhas a stronger affinity for acids than soda has. His experiments on the\r\nsubject are to be found in a paper on Mineral Waters, published in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions, by Dr. Donald Monro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n  C.
