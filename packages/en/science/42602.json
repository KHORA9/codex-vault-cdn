That the history of the invention of a piece of mechanism,\r\nand the description of its structure, operation, and [Pg004]\r\nuses, should be capable of being rendered the subject matter of a\r\nvolume, destined not alone for the instruction of engineers or\r\nmachinists, but for the information and amusement of the public in\r\ngeneral, is a statement which at no very remote period would have\r\nbeen deemed extravagant and incredible.\r\n\r\nAdvanced as we are in the art of rendering knowledge popular, and\r\ncultivated as the public taste is in the appreciation of the\r\nexpedients by which science ministers to the uses of life, there\r\nis still perhaps but one machine of which such a proposition can\r\nbe truly predicated: it is needless to say that that machine is\r\nthe STEAM ENGINE. There are many circumstances attending this\r\nextraordinary piece of mechanism which impart to it an interest so\r\nuniversally felt. Whether we regard the details of its structure\r\nand operation, the physical principles which it calls into play,\r\nand the beautiful contrivances by which these physical principles\r\nare rendered available;—or, passing over these _means_, we direct\r\nour attention to the _ends_ which they attain, we are equally\r\nfilled with astonishment and admiration. The history of the steam\r\nengine offers to our notice a series of contrivances which, for\r\nexquisite and refined ingenuity, stand without any parallel in the\r\nannals of mechanical science. These admirable inventions, unlike\r\nother results of scientific inquiry, have also this peculiarity,\r\nthat, to understand their excellence and to perceive their beauty,\r\nno previous or subsidiary knowledge is necessary, save what may be\r\nimparted with facility and clearness in the progress of the\r\nexplanation and development of the machine itself. A simple and\r\nclear exposition, divested of needless technicalities and aided by\r\nwell-selected diagrams, is all that is necessary to render the\r\nconstruction and operation of the steam engine, in all its forms,\r\nintelligible to persons of plain understanding and moderate\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nBut if the contrivances by which this vast power is brought to bear\r\non the arts and manufactures, be rendered attractive by their great\r\nmechanical beauty, how much more imposing will the subject become\r\nwhen the effects which the steam engine has produced upon the\r\nwell-being of the human race are considered. It has penetrated the\r\ncrust of the earth, and drawn from beneath it boundless treasures\r\n[Pg005] of mineral wealth, which, without its aid, would have been\r\nrendered inaccessible; it has drawn up, in measureless quantity,\r\nthe fuel on which its own life and activity depend; it has relieved\r\nmen from their most slavish toils, and reduced labour in a great\r\ndegree to light and easy superintendence. To enumerate its present\r\neffects, would be to count almost every comfort and every luxury of\r\nlife. It has increased the sum of human happiness, not only by\r\ncalling new pleasures into existence, but by so cheapening former\r\nenjoyments as to render them attainable by those who before could\r\nnever have hoped to share them: the surface of the land, and the\r\nface of the waters, are traversed with equal facility by its power;\r\nand by thus stimulating and facilitating the intercourse of nation\r\nwith nation, and the commerce of people with people, it has knit\r\ntogether remote countries by bonds of amity not likely to be\r\nbroken. Streams of knowledge and information are kept flowing\r\nbetween distant centres of population, those more advanced\r\ndiffusing civilisation and improvement among those that are more\r\nbackward. The press itself, to which mankind owes in so large a\r\ndegree the rapidity of their improvement in modern times, has had\r\nits power and influence increased in a manifold ratio by its union\r\nwith the steam engine. It is thus that literature is cheapened,\r\nand, by being cheapened, diffused; it is thus that Reason has taken\r\nthe place of Force, and the pen has superseded the sword; it is\r\nthus that war has almost ceased upon the earth, and that the\r\ndifferences which inevitably arise between people and people are\r\nfor the most part adjusted by peaceful negotiation.\r\n\r\nDeep as the interest must be with which the steam engine will be\r\nregarded in every civilised country, it presents peculiar claims\r\nupon the attention of the people of Great Britain. Its invention\r\nand progressive improvement are the work of our own time and our\r\nown country; it has been produced and matured almost within the\r\nlast century, and is the exclusive offspring of British genius,\r\nfostered and sustained by British enterprise and British capital.\r\n\r\nThe steam engine is a mechanical contrivance, by which coal, wood,\r\nor other fuel is rendered capable of executing any [Pg006] kind\r\nof labour. COALS are by it made to spin, weave, dye, print and\r\ndress silks, cottons, woollens, and other cloths; to make paper,\r\nand print books upon it when made; to convert corn into flour; to\r\nexpress oil from the olive, and wine from the grape; to draw up\r\nmetal from the bowels of the earth; to pound and smelt it, to melt\r\nand mould it; to forge it; to roll it, and to fashion it into\r\nevery desirable form; to transport these manifold products of its\r\nown labour to the doors of those for whose convenience they are\r\nproduced; to carry persons and goods over the waters of rivers,\r\nlakes, seas, and oceans, in opposition alike to the natural\r\ndifficulties of wind and water; to carry the wind-bound ship out\r\nof port; to place her on the open deep ready to commence her\r\nvoyage; to throw its arms around the ship of war, and place her\r\nside by side with the enemy; to transport over the surface of the\r\ndeep persons and information, from town to town, and from country\r\nto country, with a speed as much exceeding that of the ordinary\r\nwind, as the ordinary wind exceeds that of a common pedestrian.\r\n\r\nSuch are the virtues, such the powers, which the steam engine has\r\nconferred upon COALS. The means of calling these powers into\r\nactivity are supplied by a substance which nature has happily\r\nprovided in unbounded quantity in every part of the earth; and\r\nthough it has no price, it has inestimable value: this substance\r\nis WATER.\r\n\r\nA pint of water may be evaporated by two ounces of coals. In its\r\nevaporation it swells into two hundred and sixteen gallons of\r\nsteam, with a mechanical force sufficient to raise a weight of\r\nthirty-seven tons a foot high. The steam thus produced has a\r\npressure equal to that of common atmospheric air; and by allowing\r\nit to expand, by virtue of its elasticity, a further mechanical\r\nforce may be obtained, at least equal in amount to the former. A\r\npint of water, therefore, and two ounces of common coal, are thus\r\nrendered capable of doing as much work as is equivalent to\r\nseventy-four tons raised a foot high.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which the steam engine is worked on a\r\nrailway are not favourable to the economy of fuel. Nevertheless\r\na pound of coke burned in a locomotive engine [Pg007] will\r\nevaporate about five pints of water. In their evaporation they\r\nwill exert a mechanical force sufficient to draw two tons weight\r\non the railway a distance of one mile in two minutes. Four horses\r\nworking in a stage-coach on a common road are necessary to draw\r\nthe same weight the same distance in six minutes.\r\n\r\nA train of coaches weighing about eighty tons, and transporting\r\ntwo hundred and forty passengers with their luggage, has been\r\ntaken from Liverpool to Birmingham, and back from Birmingham to\r\nLiverpool, the trip each way taking about four hours and a\r\nquarter, stoppages included. The distance between these places by\r\nthe railway is ninety-five miles. This double journey of one\r\nhundred and ninety miles is effected by the mechanical force\r\nproduced in the combustion of four tons of coke, the value of\r\nwhich is about five pounds. To carry the same number of passengers\r\ndaily between the same places by stage-coaches on a common road,\r\nwould require twenty coaches and an establishment of three\r\nthousand eight hundred horses, with which the journey in each\r\ndirection would be performed in about twelve hours, stoppages\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\nThe circumference of the earth measures twenty-five thousand\r\nmiles; and if it were begirt with an iron railway, such a train as\r\nabove described, carrying two hundred and forty passengers, would\r\nbe drawn round it by the combustion of about thirty tons of coke,\r\nand the circuit would be accomplished in five weeks.\r\n\r\nIn the drainage of the Cornish mines the economy of fuel is much\r\nattended to, and coals are there made to do more work than\r\nelsewhere. A bushel of coals usually raises forty thousand tons of\r\nwater a foot high; but it has on some occasions raised sixty\r\nthousand tons the same height. Let us take its labour at fifty\r\nthousand tons raised one foot high. A horse worked in a fast\r\nstage-coach pulls against an average resistance of about a quarter\r\nof a hundred weight. Against this he is able to work at the usual\r\nspeed through about eight miles daily: his work is therefore\r\nequivalent to one thousand tons raised one foot. A bushel of coals\r\nconsequently, as used in Cornwall, performs as much labour as a\r\nday's work of one hundred such horses. [Pg008]\r\n\r\nThe great pyramid of Egypt stands upon a base measuring seven\r\nhundred feet each way, and is five hundred feet high, its weight\r\nbeing twelve thousand seven hundred and sixty millions of pounds.\r\nHerodotus states, that in constructing it one hundred thousand men\r\nwere constantly employed for twenty years. The materials of this\r\npyramid would be raised from the ground to their present position\r\nby the combustion of about four hundred and eighty tons of coals.\r\n\r\nThe Menai Bridge consists of about two thousand tons of iron, and\r\nits height above the level of the water is one hundred and twenty\r\nfeet. Its mass might be lifted from the level of the water to its\r\npresent position by the combustion of four bushels of coal.\r\n\r\nThe enormous consumption of coals produced by the application of\r\nthe steam engine in the arts and manufactures, as well as to\r\nrailways and navigation, has of late years excited the fears of\r\nmany as to the possibility of the exhaustion of our coal-mines.\r\nSuch apprehensions are, however, altogether groundless. If the\r\npresent consumption of coal be estimated at sixteen millions of\r\ntons annually, it is demonstrable that the coal-fields of this\r\ncountry would not be exhausted for many centuries.\r\n\r\nBut in speculations like these, the probable, if not certain\r\nprogress of improvement and discovery ought not be overlooked; and\r\nwe may safely pronounce that, long before such a period of time\r\nshall have rolled away, other and more powerful mechanical agents\r\nwill supersede the use of coal. Philosophy already directs her\r\nfinger at sources of inexhaustible power in the phenomena of\r\nelectricity and magnetism. The alternate decomposition and\r\nrecomposition of water, by magnetism and electricity, has too\r\nclose an analogy to the alternate processes of vaporisation and\r\ncondensation, not to occur at once to every mind: the development\r\nof the gases from solid matter by the operation of the chemical\r\naffinities, and their subsequent condensation into the liquid\r\nform, has already been essayed as a source of power. In a word,\r\nthe general state of physical science at the present moment, the\r\nvigour, activity, and sagacity with which researches in it are\r\nprosecuted in every civilised [Pg009] country, the increasing\r\nconsideration in which scientific men are held, and the personal\r\nhonours and rewards which begin to be conferred upon them, all\r\njustify the expectation that we are on the eve of mechanical\r\ndiscoveries still greater than any which have yet appeared; and\r\nthat the steam engine itself, with the gigantic powers conferred\r\nupon it by the immortal Watt, will dwindle into insignificance in\r\ncomparison with the energies of nature which are still to be\r\nrevealed; and that the day will come when that machine, which is\r\nnow extending the blessings of civilisation to the most remote\r\nskirts of the globe, will cease to have existence except in the\r\npage of history.\r\n\r\n\r\n(2.) The object of the present volume will be to deliver, in an\r\neasy and familiar style, an historical view of the invention of the\r\nsteam engine, and an exposition of its structure and operation in\r\nthe various forms in which it is now used, and of its most\r\nimportant applications in the arts of life, especially in transport\r\nby land and water. It is hoped that the details of these subjects\r\nmay be rendered easily intelligible to all persons of ordinary\r\ninformation, whether urged by that natural and laudable spirit of\r\ninquiry awakened by contemplating effects on the material and\r\nsocial condition of our species, so rapid and so memorable as those\r\nwhich have followed the invention of the steam engine, and by the\r\npleasure which results from the perception of the numerous\r\ninstances of successful contrivances and beautiful applications of\r\nscience to art which it unfolds,—or impelled by the exigencies of\r\ntrade or profession to acquire an acquaintance with a machine on\r\nwhich, more than any other, the prosperity of our commercial and\r\nmanufacturing interests depends. It will be our aim to afford to\r\nthe former class all the information which they can require; and,\r\nif this work be not as comprehensive in its scope, and as minute in\r\nits details, as some of the latter may wish, it will at least serve\r\nas an easy and convenient introduction to other works more\r\nvoluminous, costly, and detailed, but less elementary in their\r\nmatter, and less familiar in their style.\r\n\r\nIn explaining the different forms of steam engine which have been\r\nproposed in the course of the progressive improvement [Pg010] of\r\nthat machine from its early rude and imperfect state to its\r\npresent comparatively perfect form, it will be necessary to advert\r\nto various physical phenomena and mechanical principles, which,\r\nhowever obvious to those who are conversant with matters of\r\nscience, must necessarily be at least imperfectly known by the\r\ngreat majority of our readers. To refer for information on such\r\ntopics to other works on Mechanics and general Physics, would be\r\nwith most readers ineffectual, and with all unsatisfactory. In\r\nformer editions of the present work, we consigned these necessary\r\ngeneral principles of physics and mechanics to a preliminary\r\nchapter; but it appears, on the whole, more convenient not to\r\nremove the exposition of the principle from the place where its\r\napplication is required. We shall therefore pause as we proceed,\r\nwhere these difficulties occur, to give such explanation and\r\nillustration as may seem best suited to render them intelligible\r\nand interesting to the unscientific reader.\r\n\r\nThe history of the arts and manufactures affords no example of any\r\ninvention the credit for which has been claimed by so many\r\ndifferent nations and individuals as that of the steam engine. The\r\nadvocates of the competitors for this honour have urged their\r\npretensions, and pressed their claims, with a zeal which has\r\noccasionally outstripped the bounds of discretion, and the contest\r\nhas not unfrequently been tinged with prejudices, national and\r\npersonal, and characterised by a degree of asperity altogether\r\nunworthy of so noble a cause, and beneath the dignity of science.\r\n\r\n\"When a question is clearly proposed, it is already half resolved.\"\r\nLet us see whether a careful attention to this maxim will aid us\r\nin the investigation of the origin of the steam engine. The source\r\nof the power of that machine is found in the following natural\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n_First._ When fire is applied to water, the liquid swells into\r\nvapour, and in undergoing this change exerts, as has been already\r\nstated, a considerable amount of mechanical force. This force may,\r\nby proper means, be rendered applicable to any purpose for which\r\nlabour or power is needful.\r\n\r\n_Second._ The vapour so produced is endowed with the property of\r\nelasticity, in virtue of which it is capable of [Pg011] swelling\r\nor expanding into increased dimensions, exerting, as it expands, a\r\nforce, the energy of which is gradually diminished as the\r\ndimensions of the vapour are increased. This mechanical force is\r\nlikewise capable of being applied to any useful purpose for which\r\nlabour or power is necessary.\r\n\r\n_Third._ This vapour is capable, by proper means, of being\r\nreconverted into water; and when so reconverted, it shrinks into\r\nits original dimensions, deserting the large space which it\r\noccupied as vapour, and leaving that space a vacuum. It is known\r\nin physics, that when a vacuum is produced, surrounding bodies\r\nhave a tendency to rush into it with a definite amount of force.\r\nConsequently any agent which produces a vacuum, becomes a source\r\nof a considerable amount of mechanical power. By its reconversion\r\ninto water, therefore, steam again becomes a mechanical agent.\r\n\r\nSuch are the natural phenomena in which are found the original\r\nsources of all steam power. In some forms of steam engine one of\r\nthese is used, and in some another, and in some the application of\r\nall of them is combined; but in no existing form of steam engine\r\nwhatever is there any other source of mechanical power.\r\n\r\nNeither these nor any other natural forces can be applied\r\n_immediately_ to any useful purpose. The interposition of\r\nmechanism is indispensable; on the invention and contrivance of\r\nthat mechanism depends altogether the useful application of these\r\nnatural forces.\r\n\r\nThe world owes the steam engine then partly to _discovery_, and\r\npartly to _invention_.\r\n\r\nHe that discovered the fact, that mechanical force was produced in\r\nthe conversion of water into steam, must be justly held to be a\r\nsharer in the merit of the steam engine, even though he should\r\nnever have practically applied his discovery. The like may be said\r\nof him who first discovered the source of the mechanical power\r\narising from the expansion of steam.\r\n\r\nThe discoverer of the fact, that steam being reconverted into\r\nwater greatly contracted its dimensions, and thereby produced a\r\nvacuum, is likewise entitled to a share of the credit. [Pg012]\r\n\r\nThe mechanism by which these natural forces have been rendered so\r\nuniversally available as a moving power, is very various and\r\ncomplicated, and cannot be traced to one inventor. \"If a\r\nwatchmaker,\" says M. Arago, \"well instructed in the history of his\r\nart, were required to give a categorical answer to the question,\r\nWho has invented watches? he would remain mute; but the question\r\nwould be divested of much of its difficulty if he were required\r\nseparately to declare who discovered the use of the main spring,\r\nthe different forms of escapement, or the balance wheel.\" So it is\r\nwith the steam engine. It is a combination of a great variety of\r\ncontrivances, distinct from each other, which are the production\r\nof several inventors. If, however, one name more than the rest be\r\nentitled to special notice; if _he_ is entitled to the chief\r\ncredit of the invention who by the powers of his mechanical genius\r\nhas imparted to the steam engine that form, and conferred upon it\r\nthose qualities, on which mainly depends its present extensive\r\nutility, and by which it has become an agent of transcendant\r\npower, spreading its beneficial effects throughout every part of\r\nthe civilised globe, then the universal voice will, as it were by\r\nacclamation, award the honour to one individual, whose pre-eminent\r\ngenius places him far above all other competitors, and from the\r\napplication of whose mental energies to this machine may be dated\r\nthose grand effects which render it a topic of interest to all for\r\nwhom the progress of civilisation has any attractions. Before the\r\nera rendered memorable by the discoveries of JAMES WATT, the steam\r\nengine, which has since become an object of such universal\r\ninterest, was a machine of extremely limited power, inferior in\r\nimportance and usefulness to most other mechanical agents used as\r\nprime movers; but, from that epoch, it is scarcely necessary here\r\nto state, that it became a subject not of British interest only,\r\nbut one having an important connection with the progress of the\r\nhuman race.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERO OF ALEXANDRIA, 120 B. C.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(3.) The discovery of the fact, that a mechanical force is\r\nproduced when water is evaporated by the application of heat,\r\n[Pg013] must be considered as the first capital step in the\r\ninvention of the steam engine. It is recorded in a work entitled\r\n_Spiritalia seu Pneumatica_, that Hero of Alexandria contrived a\r\nmachine, 120 years before the Christian era, which was moved by\r\nthe mechanical force of the vapour of water. The principle of this\r\nmachine admits of easy explanation: When a fluid issues from any\r\nvessel in which it is confined, that vessel suffers a force equal\r\nto that with which the fluid escapes from it, and in the opposite\r\ndirection. If water issues from an orifice, a pressure is produced\r\nbehind the orifice corresponding to the force with which the water\r\nescapes. If a man discharge a gun, the gases produced by the\r\nexplosion of the powder issue with a certain force from the\r\nmuzzle, and his shoulder is driven backwards by the recoil with a\r\ncorresponding force. If the muzzle, instead of being presented\r\nforwards, were turned at right angles to the length of the gun,\r\nthen, as the gases of explosion would escape sideways, the recoil\r\nwould likewise take place sideways, and the shooter, instead of\r\nbeing driven backward, would be made to spin round as a dancer\r\npirouettes. This was the principle of Hero's steam engine. A small\r\nglobe or ball was placed on pivots at A and B (_fig._ 1.), on\r\nwhich it was capable of revolving: steam was supplied through one\r\nof these pivots from one of the tubes D C E F, which communicated\r\nwith the boiler. This steam filled the globe A I B K, and also the\r\narms I H and K G. A lateral orifice, represented at G, near the\r\nend of these arms, allowed the steam to escape in a jet, and the\r\nreaction, producing a recoil, had a tendency to drive the arm\r\nround. A small orifice at H, on the other side of the tube,\r\nproduced a like effect. In the same manner, any convenient number\r\nof arms might be provided, surrounding the globe and communicating\r\nwith its interior like the spokes of a wheel. Thus these arms,\r\nhaving lateral orifices for the escape of the steam, all placed so\r\nthat the recoil may [Pg014] tend to turn the globe in the same\r\ndirection, a rotatory motion might be communicated to any\r\nmachinery which it was desired to move.\r\n\r\nAfter having been allowed to slumber for nearly two thousand\r\nyears, this machine has recently been revived, and engines\r\nconstructed similar to it are now working in these countries. In\r\nthe proper place we shall describe Avery's Rotatory Engine, which\r\nit will be seen is, not only in its principle, but almost in its\r\ndetails, the machine of HERO OF ALEXANDRIA.\r\n\r\nAlthough the elastic force of steam was not reduced to numerical\r\nmeasure by the ancients, nor brought under control, nor applied to\r\nany useful purpose, yet it appears to have been recognised in\r\nvague and general terms. Aristotle, Seneca, and other ancient\r\nwriters, accounted for earthquakes by the sudden conversion of\r\nwater into steam within the earth. This change, according to them,\r\nwas effected by subterranean heat. Such tremendous effects being\r\nascribed to steam, it can scarcely be doubted that the Greeks and\r\nRomans were acquainted with the fact, that water in passing into\r\nvapour exercises considerable mechanical power. They were aware\r\nthat the earthquakes, which they ascribed to this cause, exerted\r\nforces sufficiently powerful to extend the natural limits of the\r\nocean; to overturn from their foundations the most massive\r\nmonuments of human labour; to raise islands in the midst of seas;\r\nand to heave up the surface of the land of level continents so as\r\nto form lofty mountains.\r\n\r\nSuch notions, however, resulted not as consequences of any exact\r\nor scientific principles, but from vague analogies derived from\r\neffects which could not fail to have been manifested in the arts,\r\nsuch as those which commonly occurred in the process of casting in\r\nmetal the splendid statues which adorned the temples, gardens, and\r\npublic places of Rome and Athens. The artisan was liable to the\r\nsame accidents to which modern founders are exposed, produced by\r\nthe casual presence of a little water in the mould into which the\r\nmolten metal is poured. Under such circumstances, the sudden\r\nformation of steam of an extreme pressure produces, as is well\r\nknown, explosions attended with destructive effects. The Grecian\r\n[Pg015] and Roman artisans were subject to such accidents; and the\r\nphilosopher, generalising such a fact, would arrive at a solution\r\nof the grander class of phenomena of earthquakes and volcanoes.\r\n\r\nBefore natural phenomena are rendered subservient to purposes of\r\nutility, they are often made to minister to the objects of\r\nsuperstition. The power of steam is not an exception to this rule.\r\nIt is recorded in the Chronicles, that upon the banks of the Weser\r\nthe ancient Teutonic gods sometimes marked their displeasure by a\r\nsort of thunderbolt, which was immediately succeeded by a cloud\r\nthat filled the temple. An image of the god _Busterich_, which was\r\nfound in some excavations, clearly explains the manner in which\r\nthis prodigy was accomplished by the priests. The head of the\r\nmetal god was hollow, and contained within it a pot of water: the\r\nmouth, and another hole, above the forehead, were stopped by\r\nwooden plugs; a small stove, adroitly placed in a cavity of the\r\nhead under the pot, contained charcoal, which, being lighted,\r\ngradually heated the liquid contained in the head. The vapour\r\nproduced from the water, having acquired sufficient pressure,\r\nforced out the wooden plugs with a loud report, and they were\r\nimmediately followed by two jets of steam, which formed a dense\r\ncloud round the god, and concealed him from his astonished\r\nworshippers.[1]\r\n\r\nAmong other amusing anecdotes showing the knowledge which the\r\nancients had of the mechanical force of steam, it is related that\r\nAnthemius, the architect of Saint Sophia, occupied a house next\r\ndoor to that of Zeno, between whom and Anthemius there existed a\r\nfeud. To annoy his neighbour, Anthemius placed on the ground floor\r\nof his own house several close digesters, or boilers, containing\r\nwater. A flexible tube proceeded from the top of each of these,\r\nwhich was conducted through a hole made in the wall between the\r\nhouses, and which communicated with the space under the floors of\r\nthe rooms in the house of Zeno. When Anthemius desired to annoy\r\nhis neighbour, he lighted fires under his boilers, and the steam\r\nproduced by them rushed in such quantity and with [Pg016] such\r\nforce under Zeno's floors, that they were made to heave with all\r\nthe usual symptoms of an earthquake.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\nBLASCO DE GARAY, A. D. 1543.\r\n\r\n\r\n(4.) In the year 1826, M. de Navarrete published, in Zach's\r\nAstronomical Correspondence, a communication from Thomas Gonzales,\r\nDirector of the royal archives of Simancas, giving an account of\r\nan experiment reported to have been made in the year 1543, in\r\nwhich a vessel was propelled by a machine having the appearance of\r\na steam engine.\r\n\r\nBlasco de Garay, a sea captain, proposed in that year to the Emperor\r\nCharles V. to propel vessels by a machine which he had invented,\r\neven in time of calm, without oars or sails. Notwithstanding the\r\napparent improbability attending this project, the Emperor ordered\r\nthe experiment to be made in the port of Barcelona, and the 17th of\r\nJune, 1543, was the day appointed for its trial. The commissioners\r\nappointed by Charles V. to attend and witness the experiment were\r\nDon Henry of Toledo, Don Pedro of Cardona, the treasurer Ravago, the\r\nvice chancellor and intendant of Catalonia, and others. The vessel\r\non which the experiment was made was the Trinity, 200 tons burthen,\r\nwhich had just discharged a cargo of corn at Barcelona. Garay\r\nconcealed the nature of his machinery, even from the commissioners.\r\nAll that could be discovered during the trial was, that it consisted\r\nof a large boiler containing water, and that wheels were attached to\r\neach side of the vessel, by the revolution of which it was\r\npropelled. The commissioners having witnessed the experiment, made a\r\nreport to the king, approving generally of the invention,\r\nparticularly on account of the ease and promptitude with which the\r\nvessel could be put about by it.\r\n\r\nThe treasurer Ravago, who was himself hostile to the project,\r\nreported that the machine was capable of propelling a vessel at the\r\nrate of two leagues in three hours; but the other commissioners\r\nstated that it made a league an hour at the least, and that it put\r\nthe vessel about as speedily as would be accomplished with a galley\r\nworked according to the common [Pg017] method. Ravago reported that\r\nthe machinery was too complicated and expensive, and that it was\r\nsubject to the danger of the boiler bursting.\r\n\r\nAfter the experiment was made, Garay took away all the machinery,\r\nleaving nothing but the framing of wood in the arsenals of\r\nBarcelona.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the opposition of Ravago, the invention was\r\napproved, and the inventor was promoted and received a pecuniary\r\nreward, besides having all his expenses paid.\r\n\r\nFrom the circumstance of the nature of the machinery having been\r\nconcealed, it is impossible to say in what this machine consisted;\r\nbut as a boiler was used, it is probable, though not certain, that\r\nsteam was the agent. There have been various machines proposed, of\r\nwhich a furnace and boiler form a part, and in which the agency of\r\nsteam is not used. The machine of Amontons furnishes an example of\r\nthis. It is most probable that the contrivance of Garay was\r\nidentical with that of Hero. The low state of the arts in Spain in\r\nthe sixteenth century would be incompatible with the construction\r\nof any machine requiring great precision of execution. But the\r\nsimplicity of Hero's contrivance would have rendered its\r\nconstruction and operation quite practicable. As to the claims to\r\nthe invention of the steam engine advanced by the advocates of De\r\nGaray, founded on the above document, a refutation is supplied by\r\nthe admission, that though he was rewarded and promoted by the\r\ngovernment of the day, in consequence of the experiment, and\r\nalthough the great usefulness of the contrivance in towing ships\r\nout of port, &c., was admitted, yet it does not appear that a\r\nsecond experiment was ever tried, much less that the machine was\r\never brought into practical use.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLOMON DE CAUS, 1615.\r\n\r\n\r\n(5.) Solomon De Caus was engineer and architect to Louis XIII.,\r\nking of France, before the year 1612. In that year he entered the\r\nservice of the Elector Palatine, who married the daughter of King\r\nJames I., with whom he came to England. He was there employed by\r\nthe Prince of Wales in ornamenting the gardens of his house at\r\nRichmond. [Pg018] During his sojourn in England he composed and\r\npublished at London, in the same year, a Treatise on Perspective.\r\nThis person was the author of a work entitled, \"_Les Raisons des\r\nForces Mouvantes, avec diverses Machines tant utiles que\r\nplaisantes_,\" which was apparently composed at Heidelburg, but\r\npublished at Franckfort, in 1615. The same work was subsequently\r\nrepublished in Paris in 1623.\r\n\r\nThe treatise commences with definitions of what were then\r\nconsidered the four elements: earth, air, fire, and water. Air is\r\ndefined to be a cold, dry, and light element, capable of\r\ncompression, by which it may be rendered very violent. He says,\r\n\"The violence will be great when water exhales in air by means of\r\nfire, and that the said air is enclosed: as, for example, take a\r\nball of copper of one or two feet diameter, and one inch thick,\r\nwhich being filled with water by a small hole, which shall be\r\nstrongly stopped with a peg, so that neither air nor water can\r\nescape, it is certain that if we put the said ball upon a great\r\nfire, so that it will become very hot, that it will cause a\r\ncompression so violent, that the ball will burst in pieces, with a\r\nnoise like a petard.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect which is here described is due to the combined pressure\r\nof the heated air contained in the ball and the high pressure\r\nsteam raised from the water, but much more to the latter than to\r\nthe former. It is evident, however, from the language of De Caus,\r\nthat he ascribes the force entirely to the air, and seems to\r\nconsider that the force of the air proceeded from the water which\r\nexhaled in it.\r\n\r\nThe first theorem is, \"that the parts of the elements mix together\r\nfor a time, and then each returns to its place\" (the elements here\r\nreferred to being apparently air and water). Upon this subject the\r\nfollowing is an example: \"Take a round vessel of copper, soldered\r\nclose on every side, and with a tube, whereof one end approaches\r\nnearly to the bottom of the vessel, and the other end, which\r\nprojects on the outside of the vessel, has a stop-cock; there is\r\nalso a hole in the top of the vessel, with a plug to stop it. If\r\nthis vessel will contain three pots of water, then pour in one pot\r\nof water, and place the vessel on the fire about three or four\r\nminutes, leaving the hole open; then take the vessel off the\r\n[Pg019] fire, and a little after pour out the water at the hole,\r\nand it will be found that a part of the said water has been\r\nevaporated by the heat of the fire. Then pour in one pot of water\r\nas before, and stop up the hole and the cock, and put the vessel\r\non the fire for the same time as before; then take it off, and let\r\nit cool of itself, without opening the plug, and after it is quite\r\ncold pour out the water, and it will be found exactly the same\r\nquantity as was put in. Thus we see that the water which was\r\nevaporated (the first time that the vessel was put on the fire) is\r\nreturned into water the second time when that vapour has been shut\r\nup in the vessel, and cooled of itself.\"\r\n\r\nIn the description of these experiments, the processes of\r\nevaporation and condensation are obscurely indicated; but there is\r\nno intimation that the author possessed any knowledge of the\r\nelastic force of steam. His theorem is, that the parts of the\r\nelement water mix for a time with the parts of the element air;\r\nthat fire causes this mixture, and that on removing the fire, and\r\ndissipating the heat, then the parts of the water mixed with air\r\nreturn to their proper place, forming again part of the water.\r\nThere is no indication of a _change of property_ of the water in\r\npassing into vapour. It is difficult to conceive, if De Caus had\r\nbeen aware that the vapour of water possessed the same violent\r\nforce which he distinctly and in terms ascribes to air, or if he\r\nhad been aware that in effect the vapour of the water produced by\r\nthe fire was a fluid, possessing exactly the same mechanical\r\nqualities, and producing the same mechanical effects as air, that\r\nhe would not have expressed himself clearly on the subject.\r\n\r\nHe proceeds to give another demonstration that heat will cause the\r\nparticles of water to mix with those of air.\r\n\r\n\"After having put the measure of water into the vessel, and shut\r\nthe vent-hole, and opened the cock, put the vessel on the fire,\r\nand put the pot under the cock; then the water of the vessel,\r\nraising itself by the heat of the fire, will run out through the\r\ncock; but about one sixth or one eighth part of the water will not\r\nrun out, because the violence of the vapour which causes the water\r\nto rise proceeds from the [Pg020] said water; which vapour goes\r\nout through the cock after the water with great violence. There is\r\nalso another example in quicksilver, or mercury, which is a fluid\r\nmineral, but being heated by fire, exhales in vapour, and mixes\r\nwith the air for a time; but after the said vapour is cooled, it\r\nreturns to its first nature of quicksilver. The vapour of water is\r\nmuch lighter, and therefore it rises higher,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\nIn this second demonstration there appears to be some obscure\r\nindication of the force of steam in the words \"because of the\r\nviolence of the vapour which causes the water to rise,\" &c.\r\n\r\nThe fifth theorem is the following:—\r\n\r\n\"_Water will mount by the help of fire higher than its level_,\"\r\nwhich is explained and proved in the following terms:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 2.]\r\n\r\n\"The third method of raising water is by the aid of fire. On this\r\nprinciple may be constructed various machines: I shall here\r\ndescribe one. Let a ball of copper marked A; well soldered in\r\nevery part, to which is attached a tube and stop-cock marked D, by\r\nwhich water may be introduced; and also another tube marked B C,\r\nwhich will be soldered into the top of the ball, and the lower end\r\nC of which shall descend nearly to the bottom of the ball without\r\ntouching it. Let the said ball be filled with water through the\r\ntube D, then shutting the stop-cock D, and opening the stop-cock\r\nin the vertical tube B C, let the ball be placed upon a fire the\r\nheat acting upon the said ball will cause the water to rise in the\r\ntube B C.\"\r\n\r\nIn the apparatus as here described, the space enclosed in the\r\nboiler above the surface of the water is filled with air. By the\r\naction of the fire, two effects are produced: first, the air\r\nenclosed above the water, being heated, acquires increased\r\nelasticity, and presses with a corresponding force on the surface\r\nof the water. By this means a column of water will be driven up\r\nthe tube A B at such a height as will balance the elasticity of\r\nthe heated air confined in the boiler; but besides [Pg021] this\r\nthe water contained in the boiler being heated, will produce\r\nsteam, which being mixed with air contained in the boiler, will\r\nlikewise press with its proper elasticity on the surface of the\r\nwater, and will combine with the air in raising a column of water\r\nin the tube A B. In the above description of the machine, the\r\nforce which raises the water in the tube A B is ascribed to the\r\nfire, no mention being made of the water, or of the vapour or\r\nsteam produced from it having any agency in raising the water in\r\nthe tube A B.\r\n\r\nAntecedently to the date of this invention, the effect of heat in\r\nincreasing the elastic force of air was known, and so far as the\r\nabove description goes, the whole operation might be ascribed to\r\nthe air by a person having no knowledge whatever of the elasticity\r\nof steam. M. Arago, however, who, on the grounds of this passage\r\nin the work of De Caus, claims for him a share of the honour of\r\nthe invention of the steam engine, contends that the agency of\r\nsteam in this apparatus was perfectly known to De Caus, although\r\nno mention is made of steam in the above description, because in\r\nthe second demonstration above quoted he uses the words, \"the\r\nviolence of the vapour which causes the water to rise proceeds\r\nfrom the said water; which vapour goes out from the cock after the\r\nwater with great violence.\" By these words M. Arago considers that\r\nDe Caus expresses the quality of elasticity proper to the vapour,\r\nand that the context justifies the inference, that to this\r\nelasticity he ascribed the elevation of the water in the tube C B.\r\n\r\nThere appears to be some uncertainty attending the birthplace of\r\nDe Caus. In the _Biographie Universelle_ he is said to have been\r\nborn and to have died in Normandy. M. Arago assigns Dieppe, or its\r\nneighbourhood, as his birthplace.\r\n\r\nThere was another engineer and architect, Isaac De Caus, a native\r\nof Dieppe, who published a work in folio, entitled \"_Nouvelle\r\nInvention de Lever l'Eau plus haut que sa Source, avec quelque\r\nMachines mouvantes, par le Moyen de l'Eau, et un Discours de la\r\nConduite d'Icelle_.\" This volume is without a date, but from the\r\nnature of its contents it would appear to have been published\r\nbefore the work of Solomon De Caus already cited. The drawings and\r\nmachines described in both [Pg022] are exactly the same; but the\r\ndefinitions and theorems quoted above on raising water by fire are\r\nnot given in the work of Isaac. It seems, therefore, that Solomon\r\nDe Caus re-published, with additions, the work of Isaac De Caus.\r\nFrom the same birthplace being assigned to both these authors, as\r\nwell as from the similarity of their pursuits, it is likely they\r\nwere members of the same family, and from their christian names\r\nthey were probably Jews.\r\n\r\nThe work cited above, was dedicated to Louis XIII., and in the\r\ndedication Solomon De Caus calls himself the subject of that\r\nmonarch; and in the privilege prefixed to the work he is\r\ndesignated, \"Our well-beloved Solomon De Caus, master engineer,\r\nbeing at present in the service of our dear and well-beloved\r\ncousin, the Prince Elector Palatine, has made known to us,\"\r\n&c.—\"we, desiring to gratify the said De Caus, he being our\r\nsubject,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore certain, whatever may have been the birthplace of De\r\nCaus, that he was at least a subject of France. The circumstance of\r\nhis work being written in French, though published beyond the Rhine,\r\nis also an argument in favour of his being a native of that country.\r\n\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI BRANCA, 1629.\r\n\r\n\r\n(6.) Giovanni Branca of Loretto in Italy, an engineer and\r\narchitect, proposed to work mills of different kinds by steam\r\nissuing from a large æolopile, and blowing against the vanes of a\r\nwheel. Branca was the author of many ingenious mechanical\r\ninventions, a collection of which he dedicated to M. Cenci, the\r\ngovernor of Loretto. These were published in a work printed at\r\nRome in 1629. It is a thin quarto, entitled \"_Le Machine volume\r\nnuovo, et di molto artificio da fare effetti maravigliosi tanto\r\nSpiritali quanto di Animale Operatione, arichito di bellissime\r\nfigure. Del Sig. Giovanni Branca, Cittadino Romano. In Roma,\r\n1629._\" The work contains sixty-three engravings, accompanied by\r\ndescriptions in Italian and Latin. Branca's steam engine,\r\nrepresented in the twenty-fifth plate, consists of a wheel\r\nfurnished with flat vanes upon its rim, like the boards of a\r\npaddle wheel. The steam is produced in a close vessel, and made to\r\nissue with violence from the extremity [Pg023] of a pipe directed\r\nagainst the vanes, and causes the wheel to revolve. This motion\r\nbeing imparted by the usual mechanical contrivances, any machinery\r\nmay be impelled by it. Different useful applications of this power\r\nare contained in the work, viz. pestles and mortars for pounding\r\nmaterials to make gunpowder, and rolling stones for grinding the\r\nsame; machines for raising water by buckets, for sawing timbers,\r\nfor driving piles, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThis method of applying the force of steam has no analogy to any\r\napplication of steam in modern engines.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD SOMERSET, MARQUIS OF WORCESTER, 1663.\r\n\r\n\r\n(7.) Of all the names which figure in the early annals of steam,\r\nby far the most remarkable is that of the Marquis of Worcester,\r\nwho has left a description of a machine in a work, entitled \"The\r\nScantling of One Hundred Inventions,\" which has been generally in\r\nthis country considered as giving him a right to the honour of\r\nhaving been the inventor of the steam engine.\r\n\r\nLord Worcester having been engaged on the side of the Royalists in\r\nthe civil wars of the revolution, lost his fortune, and went to\r\nIreland, where he was imprisoned. He escaped from thence, and\r\nreached France; from that country he ventured to London, as a\r\nsecret agent of Charles II., but was detected, and imprisoned in\r\nthe Tower, where he remained until the restoration, when he was\r\nset at liberty. Tradition has connected the invention of the steam\r\nengine with the following anecdote:—One day, during his\r\nimprisonment, Lord Worcester observed the lid of the pot in which\r\nhis dinner was being cooked, suddenly forced upwards by the vapour\r\nof the water which was boiling in it. Reflecting on this, it\r\noccurred to him that the same force which raised the cover of the\r\npot might be rendered, when properly applied, a useful and\r\nconvenient moving power. After he recovered his liberty, he\r\naccordingly proceeded to carry into effect this conception. The\r\ncontrivance to which he was ultimately led is described in the\r\nfollowing terms in the sixty-eighth invention, in the work above\r\nnamed:—\r\n\r\n\"I have invented an admirable and forcible way to drive [Pg024]\r\nup water by fire; not by drawing or sucking it upwards, for that\r\nmust be, as the philosopher terms it, _infra sphœrum activitatis_,\r\nwhich is but at such a distance. But this way hath no bounder if\r\nthe vessels be strong enough. For I have taken a piece of whole\r\ncannon whereof the end was burst, and filled it three quarters\r\nfull of water, stopping and screwing up the broken end, as also\r\nthe touch-hole, and making a constant fire under it; within\r\ntwenty-four hours, it burst and made a great crack. So that,\r\nhaving a way to make my vessels so that they are strengthened by\r\nthe force within them, and the one to fill after the other, I have\r\nseen the water run like a constant fountain stream forty feet\r\nhigh. One vessel of water rarefied by fire driveth up forty of\r\ncold water, and a man that tends the work has but to turn two\r\ncocks; that one vessel of water being consumed, another begins to\r\nforce and refill with cold water, and so successively; the fire\r\nbeing tended and kept constant, which the self-same person may\r\nlikewise abundantly perform in the interim between the necessity\r\nof turning the said cocks.\"\r\n\r\nSince the date of the publication of the \"Century of Inventions\"\r\nwas the year 1663, the experiments here mentioned must have been\r\nmade before that year. The description of the machine here given,\r\nas well as others in the same work, was intended by the author,\r\nnot to convey a knowledge of the nature of the mechanism which he\r\nused, but only to express the effects produced, and to indicate\r\nthe physical principle on which they depended. It should also be\r\nobserved, that an air of mystery was thrown by Worcester over the\r\naccounts of all the machines which he described; and therefore any\r\nobscurity in the above description ought not to be regarded as an\r\nevidence against his claim to the discovery of the mechanical\r\nagency of steam, so far as that agency is indicated by the effects\r\nsaid by him to be produced. The above account is, however,\r\nsufficiently distinct and explicit to enable any one possessing a\r\nknowledge of the mechanical qualities of steam to perceive the\r\ngeneral nature of the machine described. To render this machine,\r\nand that of De Caus, previously described, intelligible to those\r\nwho are not familiar with physical science, we must here explain\r\nsome general principles on which their agency depends. [Pg025]\r\n\r\n\r\n(8.) Fluid bodies are of two kinds, inelastic fluids, or liquids,\r\nand elastic fluids, or gases. Of the former of these classes,\r\nwater is the most familiar example, and of the latter, air.\r\n\r\nThese two species of fluids are each distinguished by peculiar\r\nmechanical properties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 3.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(9.) The constituent particles of a liquid are distinguished from\r\nthose of solids by having little or no coherence; so that unless\r\nthe mass be confined by the sides of the vessel which contains it,\r\nthe particles will fall asunder by their gravity. A mass of\r\nliquid, therefore, unlike a solid, can never retain any particular\r\nform, but will accommodate itself to the form of the vessel in\r\nwhich it is placed. It will press against the bottom of the vessel\r\nwhich contains it with the whole force of its weight, and it will\r\npress against the sides with a force proportional to the depth of\r\nthe particles in contact with the sides measured from the surface\r\nof the liquid above. This lateral pressure also distinguishes\r\nliquids from solids. Let us take for illustration the case of a\r\nsquare or a cubical vessel, A B C D, _fig._ 3. If a solid body,\r\nsuch as a piece of lead, be cut to the shape of this vessel, so as\r\nto fit in it without pressing with any force against its sides,\r\nthe mechanical effect which would be produced by it when placed in\r\nthe vessel, would be merely a pressure upon the bottom, B C, the\r\namount of which would be equal to the weight of the metallic mass.\r\nNo pressure would be exerted against the sides; for the coherence\r\nof the particles of the solid maintaining them in their position,\r\nthe removal of the sides would not subject the solid body\r\ncontained in the vessel to any change.\r\n\r\nNow let us suppose this solid mass of lead to be rendered liquid\r\nby being melted. The constituent particles will then be deprived\r\nof that cohesion by which they were held together; they will\r\naccordingly have a tendency to separate, and fall asunder by their\r\ngravity, and will only be prevented from actually doing so by the\r\nsupport afforded to them by the sides, [Pg026] A B, D C, of the\r\nvessel. They will therefore produce a pressure against the sides,\r\nwhich was not produced by the lead in its solid state. This\r\npressure will vary at different depths: thus a part of the side of\r\nthe vessel at P will receive a pressure proportional to the depth\r\nof the point P below the surface of the lead. If, for example, we\r\ntake a square inch of the inner surface of the side of the vessel\r\nat P, it will sustain an outward pressure equal to the weight of a\r\ncolumn of lead having a square inch for its base, and a height\r\nequal to P A. And, in like manner, every square inch of the sides\r\nof the vessel will sustain an outward pressure equal to the weight\r\nof a column of lead having a square inch for its base, and a\r\nheight equal to the depth of the point below the surface of the\r\nlead.\r\n\r\n\r\n(10.) We have here proceeded upon the supposition that no force\r\nacts on the upper surface A D of the lead. If any force presses A\r\nD downwards, that force would be transferred to the bottom by the\r\nlead, and would produce a pressure on the bottom B C equal to its\r\nown amount in addition to the weight of the lead; and if the lead\r\nwere solid, this would be the only additional mechanical effect\r\nwhich such a force acting on the surface A D of the lead would\r\nproduce. But if, on the other hand, the lead were liquified, then\r\nthe force now adverted to, acting on the surface A D, would not\r\nonly produce a pressure on the bottom B C, equal to its own amount\r\nin addition to the weight of the lead, but it would also produce a\r\npressure against every part of the sides of the vessel, equal to\r\nthat which it would produce upon an equal magnitude of the surface\r\nA D.\r\n\r\nThus if we suppose any mechanical cause producing a pressure on\r\nthe surface A D amounting to ten pounds on each square inch, the\r\neffect which would be produced, if the lead were solid, would be\r\nan additional pressure on the base B C amounting to ten pounds per\r\nsquare inch. But if the lead were liquid, besides this pressure on\r\neach square inch of the base B C, there would likewise be a\r\npressure of ten pounds on every square inch of the sides of the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nAll that has been here stated with respect to a square or a\r\ncubical vessel will be equally applicable to a vessel of any other\r\nform. [Pg027]\r\n\r\n\r\n(11.) The second class of fluids are distinguished from liquids by\r\nthe particles not merely being destitute of cohesion, but having a\r\ntendency directly the reverse, to repel each other, and fly\r\nasunder with more or less force. Thus if a vessel, such as that\r\nrepresented in _fig._ 3., were filled with a fluid of this kind,\r\nbeing open at the top, and not being restrained by any pressure\r\nincumbent upon it, the particles of the fluid would not rest in\r\nthe vessel by their gravity, as those of the liquid would do; but\r\nthey would, by their mutual repulsion, fly asunder, and rise out\r\nof the vessel, as smoke is seen to rise from a chimney, or steam\r\nfrom the spout of a kettle. Let us suppose, then, that the vessel\r\nin which an elastic fluid is contained is closed on every side by\r\nsolid surfaces. In fact, let us imagine that the square or cubical\r\nvessel represented in _fig._ 3. is closed by a square lid at the\r\ntop A D, having contained in it an elastic fluid, such as\r\natmospheric air.\r\n\r\nIf such a cover, or lid, had been placed upon a liquid, the cover\r\nwould sustain no pressure from the fluid, nor would any mechanical\r\neffect be produced, save those already described in the case of\r\nthe open vessel; but when the fluid contained in the vessel is\r\nelastic, as is the case with air, then the elasticity (by which\r\nname is expressed the tendency of the particles of the fluid to\r\nfly asunder) will produce peculiar mechanical effects, which have\r\nno existence whatever in the case of a liquid.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, supposing the fluid to be air or any other gas or\r\nvapour, a pressure will be produced upon the bottom B C of the\r\nvessel equivalent to the weight of such fluid, and lateral\r\npressures will be produced on the different points of the sides by\r\nthe weight of that part of the fluid which is above these points;\r\nbut gases and vapours are bodies of such extreme levity, that\r\nthese effects due to their weight are neglected in practice.\r\n\r\nPutting, then, the weight of the air contained in the vessel out\r\nof the question, let us consider the effect of its elasticity. If\r\nthe vessel, as already described, be supposed to contain\r\natmospheric air in its ordinary state, the tendency of the\r\nconstituent particles to fly asunder will be such as to produce on\r\nevery square inch of the inner surface of the vessel [Pg028] a\r\npressure amounting to fifteen pounds; this pressure being, as\r\nalready stated, quite independent of the weight of the air. In\r\nfact, this pressure would continue to exist if the air contained\r\nin the vessel actually ceased to have weight by being removed from\r\nthe neighbourhood of the earth, which is the cause of its gravity.\r\n\r\n\r\n(12.) Different gases are endowed with different degrees of\r\nelasticity, and the same gas may have its elasticity increased or\r\ndiminished, either by varying the space within which it is\r\nconfined, or by altering the temperature to which it is exposed.\r\n\r\nIf the space within which an elastic fluid is enclosed be\r\nenlarged, its elasticity is found to diminish in the same\r\nproportion. Thus if the air contained in the vessel A B C D\r\n(_fig._ 3.) be allowed to pass into a vessel of twice the\r\nmagnitude, the elasticity of the particles will cause them to\r\nrepel each other, so that the same quantity of air shall diffuse\r\nitself throughout the larger vessel, assuming double its former\r\nbulk. Under such circumstances, the pressure which it would exert\r\nupon the sides of the larger vessel would be only half that which\r\nit had exerted on the sides of the smaller vessel. If, on the\r\nother hand, it were forced into a vessel of half the magnitude of\r\nA B C D, as it might be, then its elasticity would be double, and\r\nit would press on the inner surface of that vessel with twice the\r\nforce with which it pressed on that of the vessel A B C D.\r\n\r\nThis power of swelling and contracting its dimensions according to\r\nthe dimensions of the vessel in which it is confined, or to the\r\nforce compressing it, is a quality which results immediately from\r\nelasticity, and is consequently one which is peculiar to the gases\r\nor elastic fluids, and does not at all appertain to liquids. If\r\nthe liquid contained in the vessel A B C D were transferred to a\r\nvessel of twice the magnitude, it would only occupy half the\r\ncapacity of that vessel, and it could not by any means be\r\ntransferred, as we have supposed the air or gas to be, to a vessel\r\nof half the dimensions, since it is inelastic and incompressible.\r\n\r\n\r\n(13.) The elasticity of gases is likewise varied by varying the\r\ntemperature to which they are exposed; thus, in general, [Pg029]\r\nif air or any other gas be augmented in temperature, it will\r\nlikewise be increased in elasticity; and if, on the other hand, it\r\nbe diminished in temperature, it will be likewise diminished in\r\nits elastic force. The more heated, therefore, any air or gas\r\nconfined in a vessel becomes, the greater will be the force with\r\nwhich it will press on the inner surface of that vessel, and tend\r\nto burst it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(14.) The same body may, by the agency of heat, be made to pass\r\nsuccessively through the different states of solid, liquid, and\r\ngas, or vapour. The most familiar and obvious example of these\r\nsuccessive transitions is presented by water. Exposed to a certain\r\ntemperature, water can only exist as a solid; as the temperature\r\nis increased, the ice, or solid water, is liquefied; and by the\r\ncontinued application of heat, this water again undergoes a\r\nchange, and assumes the form, and acquires the mechanical\r\nqualities, of air or gas: in such a state it is called STEAM.\r\n\r\nThis is a common property of all liquids. If they be exposed for a\r\nsufficient length of time to a sufficient degree of heat, they\r\nwill always be converted into elastic fluids. These are usually\r\ndistinguished from air and other permanent gases, which never are\r\nknown to exist in the liquid form, by the term _vapour_, by which,\r\ntherefore, must be understood an elastic fluid which at common\r\ntemperatures exists in the liquid or solid state; by _steam_ is\r\nexpressed the vapour of water; and by _gases_, those elastic\r\nfluids which like air are never known—at least, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances—to exist in any other but the elastic form.\r\n\r\n\r\n(15.) When a liquid is caused, by the application of heat, to take\r\nthe form of an elastic fluid, or is evaporated, besides acquiring\r\nthe property of elasticity, it always undergoes a considerable\r\nchange of bulk. The amount of this change is different with\r\ndifferent liquids, and even with the same liquid it varies with\r\nthe circumstances under which the change is produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n(16.) When water is evaporated under ordinary circumstances,—that\r\nis, when exposed to no other external pressure than that of the\r\natmosphere,—it increases its volume about seventeen-hundred-fold.\r\nThus a cubic inch of liquid [Pg030] water would form about\r\nseventeen hundred cubic inches of common steam. If, however, the\r\nwater be confined by a greater pressure than that produced by the\r\ncommon atmosphere, then the increase of volume which takes place\r\nin its evaporation would be less in proportion.\r\n\r\nThese important physical circumstances are now only indicated in a\r\ngeneral way. As we proceed with our account of the invention and\r\nimprovement of the steam engine, they will be developed more fully\r\nand accurately.\r\n\r\n\r\n(17.) After duly considering what has been just explained, no\r\ndifficulty will be found in comprehending the principles on which\r\nthe first rude attempts at the mechanical application of steam\r\nalready stated depend. In the apparatus ascribed to _Hero_ of\r\nAlexandria, the elasticity of the vapour contained in the arms of\r\nthe revolving ball causes that vapour to issue from the lateral\r\norifices in the arms, such as that of G, _fig._ 1. As these\r\norifices, however, are exposed to the common atmosphere pressing\r\ninwards with a force, the mean amount of which has been stated to\r\nbe about fifteen pounds per square inch, it follows that the steam\r\ncannot escape from these orifices until its pressure or elasticity\r\nexceeds this amount, and that when it does, the force with which\r\nit will so escape will be the excess of its elasticity above that\r\nof the atmosphere; and it is the reaction produced by this\r\ndifference of pressure, causing the arms to recoil, which will\r\ngive motion to the machine.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the apparatus of _De Caus_ (5.), the heat of the\r\nfire acting on the vessel D C (_fig._ 2.) will raise the\r\ntemperature of the water contained in it, and also of the air\r\nconfined within it above the surface of that water. This air, as\r\nit is increased in temperature, will also increase in elasticity;\r\nit will therefore press on the surface of the water with increased\r\nforce, and will gradually force the water upwards in the tube; and\r\nthis effect would continue until all the water in the vessel would\r\nbe forced up the tube.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time that the heat acting on the vessel increases\r\nthe temperature of the air above the water, it also produces a\r\npartial evaporation of the water, so that more or less steam is\r\nmixed with the air in the vessel above the surface [Pg031] of the\r\nwater; and this steam possessing elasticity, unites with the air\r\nin pressing on the surface of the water, and in raising it in the\r\ntube.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figs._ 4, 5, and 6.]\r\n\r\nLet us now revert to the brief account of the engine of the\r\nMarquis of Worcester, described in \"The Century of Inventions.\" We\r\ncollect from that description that the vessel in which the water\r\nwas evaporated was separate from those which contained the water\r\nto be elevated; also that there were two vessels of the like\r\ndescription, the contents of which were alternately elevated by\r\nthe pressure of the \"water rarefied by the fire;\" in other words\r\nby steam; and that the water was raised in an uninterrupted\r\nstream, by the management of two cocks communicating with these\r\nvessels and with the boiler. The following is such an apparatus as\r\nwould answer this description. Let E (_fig._ 4.) be the vessel\r\ncontaining the water to be evaporated, placed over a proper\r\nfurnace A; let S be a pipe to allow the steam produced from the\r\nboiling water in E to pass into the vessels where its mechanical\r\naction is required. Let R represent a cock or regulator, having in\r\nit a curved passage, leading from S to the tube T, when the lever\r\nor handle L is in the position represented by the cut; but leading\r\nto the tube T′, when the lever L is turned one quarter of a\r\nrevolution to the right, as represented in _fig._ 5. By the\r\nshifting of this lever, therefore, the steam pipe S may be made to\r\ncommunicate alternately with the tubes T and T′. The tubes T and\r\nT′ are carried respectively to two vessels V and V′, which are\r\nfilled with the water required to be raised. In these [Pg032]\r\nvessels tubes enter at C and C′, descending nearly to the bottom:\r\nthese tubes have valves at B and B′, opening upwards, by which\r\nwater will be allowed to pass into the vertical tube F, but which\r\nwill not allow it to return downwards, the valves B and B′ being\r\nthen closed by the weight of the water above them.\r\n\r\nLet G G′ be a pipe entering the sides of the vessels V and V′, for\r\nthe purpose of filling them with the water to be raised: let K be\r\na cock having a curved passage similar to the cock R, and leading\r\nto a tube by which water is supplied from the reservoir or other\r\nsource from which the water to be raised is drawn. When the cock K\r\nis placed as represented in _fig._ 4., the water from the\r\nreservoir will flow through the curved passage in the cock K into\r\nthe tube G′, and thence into the vessel V′; but when this cock is\r\nturned one quarter round, by shifting the lever to the left, it\r\nwill take the position represented in _fig._ 6., and the water\r\nwill flow through the curved passage into the tube G, and thence\r\ninto the vessel V. Let us now suppose the vessel V already filled\r\nwith water to be elevated, and the vessel V′ to have discharged\r\nits contents. The cock R is turned, so as to allow the steam\r\ngenerated in the boiler E to pass into the tube T, and thence into\r\nthe upper part of the vessel V, while the cock K is turned so as\r\nto allow the water from the reservoir to pass into the tube G′,\r\nand thence into the vessel V′. The steam collecting in the upper\r\npart of the vessel V′ presses with its elastic force on the\r\nsurface of the water therein, and forces the water upwards in the\r\ntube C; it passes through the valve B, which it opens by the\r\nupward pressure received from the action of the steam, and thence\r\ninto the tube F, its descent into the tube C′ being prevented by\r\nthe valve V′, which can only be opened upwards. As the steam is\r\ngradually supplied from the boiler E, the water in the vessel V is\r\nforced up the tube C, through the valve B, and into the tube F,\r\nuntil all the contents of the vessel V above the lower end of the\r\ntube C have been raised. In the meanwhile, the vessel V′ has been\r\nfilled with water, through the cock K: when this has been\r\naccomplished, the man who attends the machine shifts the cocks R\r\nand K, so as to give them the position represented in _fig._ 5.\r\nand _fig._ 6. [Pg033] In this position, the steam from the\r\nboiler, being excluded from the tube T, will be conducted to the\r\ntube T′, and thence to the vessel V′, while the water from the\r\nreservoir will be excluded from the tube G′, and conducted through\r\nthe tube G to the vessel V. The vessel V will thus be replenished\r\nand, by a process similar to that already described, the contents\r\nof the vessel V′ will be forced up the tube C′, through the valve\r\nB′, and into the tube F; its descent into the tube C being\r\nprevented by the valve B, which will then be closed. After the\r\ncontents of the vessel V′ have thus been raised, and the vessel V\r\nreplenished, the two cocks R and K are once more shifted, and the\r\ncontents of V raised while V′ is replenished, and so on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 4, 5, and 6.]\r\n\r\nIf, having comprehended the apparatus here described, the reader\r\nrefers to the description of the Marquis of Worcester's machine,\r\nhe will find that all the conditions therein laid down are\r\nfulfilled by it. One vessel (E) of \"water rarefied by fire\" may by\r\nsuch means \"drive up forty (or more) of cold water; and the man\r\nthat tends the work has but to turn two cocks, that one vessel (V)\r\nof water being consumed, another (V′) begins to force and refill\r\nwith cold water, and so on successively, the fire being tended and\r\nkept constant; which the self-same person may likewise abundantly\r\nperform, in the interim between the necessity of turning the said\r\ncocks.\"\r\n\r\nOn comparing this with the contrivance previously suggested by De\r\nCaus, it will be observed, that even if De Caus [Pg034] knew the\r\nphysical agent by which the water was driven upwards in the\r\napparatus described by him, still it was only a method of causing\r\na vessel of boiling water to empty itself; and before a repetition\r\nof the process could be made, the vessel should be refilled, and\r\nagain boiled. In the contrivance of Lord Worcester, on the other\r\nhand, the agency of the steam was employed in the same manner as\r\nit is in the steam engines of the present day, being generated in\r\none vessel, and used for mechanical purposes in another. Nor must\r\nthis distinction be regarded as trifling or insignificant, because\r\non it depends the whole practicability of using steam as a\r\nmechanical agent. Had its action been confined to the vessel in\r\nwhich it was produced, it never could have been employed for any\r\nuseful purpose.\r\n\r\nAlthough many of the projects contained in Lord Worcester's work\r\nwere in the highest degree extravagant and absurd, yet the engine\r\nabove described is far from being the only practicable and useful\r\ninvention proposed in it. On the contrary, many of his inventions\r\nhave been reproduced, and some brought into general use since his\r\ntime. Among these may be mentioned, stenography, telegraphs,\r\nfloating baths, speaking statues, carriages from which horses can\r\nbe disengaged if unruly, combination locks, secret escutcheons for\r\nlocks, candle moulds, the rasping mill, the gravel engine, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR SAMUEL MORLAND, 1683.\r\n\r\n\r\n(18.) Sir Samuel Morland was the son of a baronet of the same name,\r\nwho had received his title at the restoration for some services to\r\nthe royalist party, performed by him during the wars of the\r\nCommonwealth. He appears to have devoted much attention to\r\nmechanics, in which he attained some celebrity. He was the reputed\r\ninventor of several ingenious contrivances, such as the drum capstan\r\nfor ships, the plunger pump, &c. He also investigated various\r\nquestions in acoustics, and among others, the determination of the\r\nbest form for the speaking-trumpet.\r\n\r\nIn 1680, Sir Samuel Morland was appointed Master [Pg035] of the\r\nWorks to Charles II., and in the following year was sent to\r\nFrance, to execute some waterworks for Louis XIV. In 1683, while\r\nin France, he wrote in the French language, a work entitled\r\n\"_Elevation des Eaux par toute sorte de Machines, reduite à la\r\nMesure, au Poids et à la Balance. Presentée à sa Majesté très\r\nChrestienne, par le Chevalier Morland, Gentilhomme Ordinaire de la\r\nChambre Privée, et Maistre des Méchaniques du Roi de la Grande\r\nBrétagne, 1683._\" This book is preserved in manuscript in the\r\nHarleian Collection in the British Museum. It is written on\r\nvellum, and consists of only thirty-eight pages. It contains\r\ntables of measures and weights, theorems for the calculation of\r\nthe volumes of cylinders, the weights of columns of water, the\r\nthickness of lead for pipes, and is concluded by a chapter on\r\nsteam, consisting of four pages, of which the following is a\r\ntranslation:—\r\n\r\n\"_The principles of the new force of fire invented by Chevalier\r\nMorland in 1682, and presented to His Most Christian Majesty in\r\n1683_:—\r\n\r\n\"'Water being converted into vapour by the force of fire, these\r\nvapours shortly require a greater space (about 2000 times) than the\r\nwater before occupied, and sooner than be constantly confined would\r\nsplit a piece of cannon. But being duly regulated according to the\r\nrules of statics, and by science reduced to measure, weight, and\r\nbalance, then they bear their load peaceably (like good horses), and\r\nthus become of great use to mankind, particularly for raising water,\r\naccording to the following table, which shows the number of pounds\r\nthat may be raised 1800 times per hour to a height of six inches by\r\ncylinders half filled with water, as well as the different diameters\r\nand depths of the said cylinders.'\"\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the description here given which can indicate\r\nthe form of the machine by which Morland proposed to render the\r\nforce of steam a useful mover. It is, however, remarkable, that at\r\nthis early period, before experiments had been made on the\r\nexpansion which water undergoes in evaporation, he should have\r\ngiven so near an approximation to [Pg036] the actual amount of\r\nthat expansion. It is scarcely supposable that such an estimate\r\ncould be obtained by him otherwise than by experiment.\r\n\r\nThe work containing the above description was not printed; but a\r\nwork bearing nearly the same title, containing, however, no\r\nmention of the force of steam, was published by him in Paris in\r\nthe year 1685. In this he describes various experiments made by\r\nhim at St. Germains on the weight of the water of the Seine, and\r\ngives weights of the columns of water, the contents of cylinders,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nSoon after the publication of this work, Morland returned to\r\nEngland, and resided near the court till his death. The celebrated\r\nJohn Evelyn mentioned having paid a visit to him at his house at\r\nHammersmith, in 1695, when he had become aged and blind, but was\r\nstill remarkable for his mechanical ingenuity. \"On the 25th of\r\nOctober,\" says Evelyn, \"the Archbishop and myself went to\r\nHammersmith to visit Sir Samuel Morland, who was entirely blind; a\r\nvery mortifying sight. He showed us his invention of writing\r\n(short-hand), which was very ingenious; also his wooden kalendar,\r\nwhich instructed him all by feeling; and other pretty and useful\r\ninventions of mills, pumps, &c.; and the pump he had erected, that\r\nserves water to his garden and to passengers, with an inscription,\r\nand brings from a filthy part of the Thames near it a most perfect\r\nand pure water.\"[3]\r\n\r\nHe died at Hammersmith, in January 1696; and before his death, as\r\na penance for his past life, was guilty of the eccentricity of\r\nburying in the ground six feet deep a great collection of music\r\nwhich he possessed.[4]\r\n\r\n\r\nDENIS PAPIN, 1688.\r\n\r\n\r\n(19.) Denis Papin, a native of Blois in France, and professor of\r\nmathematics at Marbourg, is the name which stands next recorded in\r\nthe progressive invention of the steam engine. To this philosopher\r\nis due the discovery of one of the qualities of steam, to the\r\nproper management of which is owing much of the efficacy of the\r\nmodern steam engine. [Pg037]\r\n\r\nPapin was born at Blois in France. He devoted his youth to the\r\nstudy of medicine, in which he took a degree at Paris. The\r\nrevocation of the Edict of Nantes having driven him into exile, he\r\nwent to England, where the celebrated Boyle associated him in\r\nseveral of his experiments with the air-pump, and caused him to be\r\nelected a fellow of the Royal Society in 1681. Having been invited\r\nto Germany by the Landgrave of Hesse, he discharged during several\r\nyears the duties of professor of mathematics at the university of\r\nMarbourg, where he died in 1710. Notwithstanding his discoveries\r\nrespecting the agency of steam, he never received any mark of\r\ndistinction in his own country. The truth is, the importance and\r\nvalue of these investigations were not apparent until long\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nThis philosopher conceived the idea of producing a moving power by\r\nmeans of a piston working in a cylinder, in the manner which we\r\nshall now briefly explain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 7.]\r\n\r\nLet A B (_fig._ 7.) be a cylinder open at the top, and let a\r\npiston P be fitted into it, so as to move in it air tight. At the\r\nbottom of the cylinder suppose an opening provided, which can be\r\nclosed at pleasure, by a stop-cock, or otherwise, so that the\r\ncommunication may be opened and closed at will between the\r\ninterior of the cylinder and the external air. This stop-cock\r\nbeing opened, let the piston be drawn upwards till it reach the\r\ntop of the cylinder. Let the stop-cock at the bottom be then\r\nremoved, and imagine that some means can be supplied by which the\r\nair within the cylinder can be suddenly annihilated. The piston,\r\nnow at the top, will have above it the pressure of the atmosphere;\r\nand having no air below, it will be resisted in its descent by no\r\nforce save that arising from its friction with the cylinder. If,\r\nthen, the force of the air above the piston be greater than the\r\nresistance arising from this friction, the piston will descend\r\nwith the excess of this force, and will continue so to descend\r\nuntil it reach the bottom of the cylinder. Having attained that\r\nposition, let us [Pg038] suppose the stop-cock in the bottom\r\nopened, so as to allow the external air to pass freely below the\r\npiston. The piston may now be drawn to the top of the cylinder\r\nagain, offering no resistance save that of its weight, and its\r\nfriction with the cylinder. Having reached the top of the cylinder\r\nonce more, let the stop-cock be closed, and the air included\r\nwithin the cylinder once more annihilated. A second descent of the\r\npiston will take place, with the same force as before, and in like\r\nmanner the process may be continued indefinitely.\r\n\r\nNow, if it should appear that means could be provided suddenly and\r\nrepeatedly to annihilate the air within the cylinder, and that the\r\npressure of the atmosphere above the piston should exert a force\r\ncompared with which the weight of the piston and its friction are\r\ntrifling, it is evident that a moving power would be obtained\r\nwhich would be capable, by proper mechanism, of being applied to\r\nany useful purpose, but which would more especially be applicable\r\nto the working of pumps, the motion of which corresponds with that\r\nwhich has been just ascribed to the piston in the cylinder. Such\r\nwere the first ideas of Papin. But in order to enable those who\r\nare not conversant with physical science fully to appreciate their\r\nimportance, it will be necessary here to explain some of the\r\nmechanical properties of atmospheric air.\r\n\r\n\r\n(20.) The atmosphere is the thin, transparent, colourless, and\r\ntherefore invisible, fluid in which we live and move, which by\r\nrespiration sustains animal life, and is otherwise connected with\r\nvarious important functions of organised matter. This fluid is so\r\nlight and attenuated, that it might at first be doubted whether it\r\nbe really a body at all; and, indeed, the name expressing\r\nincorporeal beings, _spirit_, is a word in its origin signifying\r\n_air_.[5] The air, however, is light only as compared with other\r\nmaterial substances, which exist in a more condensed state: it\r\npossesses the quality of weight as absolutely as the most solid\r\nand massive bodies in nature, and to render this quality manifest,\r\nit is only necessary to submit a sufficient quantity of air to any\r\nof the usual tests of gravitation. [Pg039]\r\n\r\nA direct demonstration of this may be given by the following\r\nexperiment:—On the mouth of a flask let a stop-cock be fastened so\r\nas to be air-tight. The interior of the flask may then be put into\r\nfree communication with the external air, or that communication may\r\nbe cut off at pleasure, by opening or closing the stop-cock. If a\r\nsyringe be applied to the mouth of the flask, the stop-cock being\r\nopen a part of the air contained in it may be drawn out. After this,\r\nthe stop-cock being closed, and the syringe detached, let the\r\nflask be placed in the dish of a good balance, and accurately\r\ncounterpoised by weights in the other dish. This counterpoise will\r\nthen represent the weight of the flask, and of the air which has\r\nremained in it. If the stop-cock be now opened, air will immediately\r\nrush in, and replace that which the syringe had withdrawn from the\r\nflask; and immediately the dish of the balance containing the flask\r\nwill sink by the effect of the weight of the air thus admitted into\r\nthe flask.\r\n\r\nIf the weight of quantity of air so small as to be capable of\r\nbeing withdrawn by a syringe from an ordinary flask be thus of\r\nsensible amount, it may be easily imagined that the vast mass of\r\natmosphere extending from the surface of the earth upwards, to a\r\nheight not ascertained with precision, but certainly not being\r\nless than thirty miles, must be very considerable. Such a force,\r\npressing as it must constantly do, upon the surfaces of all\r\nbodies, whether solid or fluid, and resisting and modifying their\r\nmovements, would play an important part in all mechanical\r\nphenomena; and it is, therefore, not sufficient merely to have\r\nrecognised its existence, but it is most needful to measure its\r\namount with that degree of certainty and precision, which will\r\nenable us to estimate its effects on those phenomena which we\r\nshall have to investigate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(21.) The amount of the pressure of the atmosphere on each square\r\ninch of horizontal surface on which it rests, is obviously the\r\nweight of the column of air extending from that square inch of\r\nsurface upwards to the top of the atmosphere. This force is\r\nmeasured by the following means:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 8.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 9.]\r\n\r\nTake a glass tube, A B (_fig._ 8.), above 32 inches long, open at\r\none end A, and closed at the other end B, and let it [Pg040] be\r\nfilled with mercury (quicksilver). Let a glass vessel or cistern\r\nC, containing a quantity of mercury, be also provided. Applying\r\nthe finger at A, so as to prevent the mercury in the tube from\r\nfalling out, let the tube be inverted, and the end, stopped by the\r\nfinger, plunged into the mercury in C. When the end of the tube is\r\nbelow the surface of the mercury in C (_fig._ 9.), let the finger\r\nbe removed. It will be found that the mercury in the tube will\r\nnot, as might be expected, fall to the level of the mercury in the\r\ncistern C, which it would do were the end B open, so as to admit\r\nthe air into the upper part of the tube. On the other hand, the\r\nlevel D of the mercury in the tube will be nearly 30 inches above\r\nthe level C of the mercury in the cistern.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this effect is, that the weight of the atmosphere\r\nrests on the surface C of the mercury in the cistern, and tends\r\nthereby to press it up, or rather to resist its fall in the tube;\r\nand as the fall is not assisted by the weight of the atmosphere on\r\nthe surface D (since B is closed), it follows, that as much\r\nmercury remains suspended in the tube above the level C, as the\r\nweight of the atmosphere is able to support.\r\n\r\nIf the section of the tube were equal to the magnitude of a square\r\ninch, the weight of the column of mercury in the tube above the\r\nlevel C would be exactly equal to the weight of the atmosphere on\r\neach square inch of the surface C.\r\n\r\n\r\n(22.) If such an apparatus be observed from time to time, it will\r\nbe found that the column of mercury sustained in the tube will be\r\nsubject to variation between certain limits, never falling below\r\ntwenty-eight inches, and never rising above thirty-one inches.\r\nThis variation of the mercurial column is produced by a\r\ncorresponding variation in the weight of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIf the apparatus be transported to any height above its ordinary\r\nposition, it will have a less quantity of atmosphere above it, and\r\ntherefore the surface of the mercury in the cistern will be\r\npressed by a less weight, and consequently the [Pg041] column of\r\nmercury will fall proportionally. In virtue of this effect, such\r\nan instrument has been rendered a means of measuring heights, such\r\nas the heights of mountains, the ascents of balloons, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n(23.) If a proper scale be attached to the tube containing the\r\nmercurial column, showing the absolute height of the column\r\nsustained at any time, and indicating its changes of height, the\r\ninstrument becomes a BAROMETER.\r\n\r\nTwo cubic inches of mercury weigh very nearly one pound\r\navoirdupois.[6] Hence, when the barometric column measures thirty\r\ninches, the weight of the atmosphere resting on each square inch\r\nof surface is about fifteen pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n(24.) It is an established property of fluids, that they press\r\nequally in all directions; and air, like every other fluid,\r\nparticipates in this quality. Hence, it follows, that when the\r\ndownward pressure or weight of the atmosphere is fifteen pounds on\r\nthe square inch, the lateral, upward, and oblique pressures are of\r\nthe same amount. But, independently of the general principle, it\r\nmay be satisfactory to give experimental proof of this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 10.]\r\n\r\nLet four glass tubes, A, B, C, D (_fig._ 10.), be constructed of\r\nsufficient length, closed at one end, A, B, C, D, and open at the\r\nother. Let the open ends of three of them be bent, as represented\r\nin the tubes B, C, D. Being previously filled with mercury, let\r\nthem all be gently inverted, so as to have their closed ends up,\r\nas here represented. It will be found that the mercury will be\r\nsustained in all, and that the difference of the levels in all\r\nwill be the same.[7] Thus, the mercury is sustained in A by the\r\nupward pressure of the atmosphere; in B, by its horizontal or\r\nlateral pressure; in C, by its downward pressure; [Pg042] and in\r\nD, by its oblique pressure: and, as the difference of the levels\r\nis the same in all, these pressures are exactly equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n(25.) The same arrangement by which the pressure of the atmosphere\r\nis measured by a mercurial column of equivalent weight, also\r\nsupplies the means of measuring the pressure or elasticity of\r\natmospheric air, or any other gas or vapour, whether in a more or\r\nless compressed or rarefied state; and as instruments constructed\r\non this principle are of considerable use in steam engines, we\r\nshall take this occasion to explain their principle and\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nIn the experiments described in (21), the space D B in the top of\r\nthe barometer-tube, from which the mercury descended, is a vacuum.\r\nIf, however, it were occupied by a quantity of air in a rarefied\r\nstate, or any other gas or vapour, such gas or vapour would press\r\non the surface of the mercury at D, with a force determined by its\r\nelasticity. In that case, the atmospheric pressure acting on the\r\nsurface of the mercury C in the cistern, would be balanced by the\r\ncombined forces of the weight of the mercurial column sustained in\r\nthe tube, and the elasticity of the gas or vapour in the upper\r\npart of it. Now if we know the actual amount of the atmospheric\r\npressure,—that is to say, the height of the column of mercury\r\nwhich it would be capable of sustaining,—we should then be able\r\nto determine the pressure of the rarefied air in the space C D.\r\n\r\nFor example, let us suppose that the barometric column, when B D\r\n(_fig._ 9.) is a vacuum, measures thirty inches: the atmospheric\r\npressure, therefore, would be equal to the weight of a column of\r\nmercury of that height. Let us suppose that the elasticity of the\r\ngas or vapour occupying the upper part of the tube D B causes the\r\ncolumn to fall to the height of twenty-six inches: it is evident,\r\nthen, that the pressure of the air in the top of the tube would be\r\nequal to the weight of a column of mercury of four inches. In\r\nfine, to determine the pressure of the rarefied gas or vapour in\r\nthe top of the tube, it is only necessary to observe the\r\ndifference between the height of the column of mercury actually\r\nsustained in the tube, and the column sustained at the same time\r\nand [Pg043] place in a common barometer: the difference of the\r\ntwo will be the column of mercury whose weight will represent the\r\npressure of the vapour or gas in the top of the tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n(26.) Whenever the air contained in any vessel or other enclosed\r\nspace has by any means had its pressure reduced so as to be\r\nrendered less than that of the external air, the external air will\r\nhave a tendency to rush into such vessel or enclosed space with a\r\nforce proportionate to the excess of the pressure of such external\r\nair over that of the air within; and if any communication be\r\nopened between the interior of such vessel or enclosed space, and\r\nthe external air, the latter will rush in until an equilibrium be\r\nestablished between the pressures within and without. It is\r\nevident that the force thus obtained by diminishing the pressure\r\nof air within a vessel may be applied to any mechanical purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is by such means that water is raised in an ordinary pump. A\r\nportion of the air contained between the piston of the pump and\r\nthe surface of the water below, is withdrawn by the action of the\r\npiston, and the pressure of the air remaining under the piston is\r\nthereby diminished. The superior pressure of the atmosphere upon\r\nthe external surface of the water in the well then forces up a\r\ncolumn of water in the pump-barrel, and this is continued as the\r\nair is more and more rarefied by the action of the piston. By\r\nwhatever means, therefore, the air can be wholly or partially\r\nwithdrawn from any space, a mechanical power will be thereby\r\ndeveloped, proportional in its amount and efficacy to the quantity\r\nof air so withdrawn. If, however, such air be withdrawn by any\r\nmechanical process, such as by a syringe, by a common pump, or by\r\nan air-pump, the quantity of force expended in withdrawing it is\r\nalways equivalent to the amount of mechanical power obtained by\r\nthe vacuum or partial vacuum so produced. Indeed the power\r\nexpended is greater than the power so obtained, inasmuch as the\r\nfriction, leakage, &c. of the exhausting apparatus must be allowed\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n\r\n(27.) There are, however, various other means by which air may be\r\npartially expelled from a vessel besides the direct application of\r\nmechanical force. Thus if heat be applied to [Pg044] the vessel,\r\nthe air, as has been already explained, will acquire increased\r\nelasticity, and will rush from the vessel with a force proportionate\r\nto the excess of its elasticity above that of the external air, and\r\nthis process may be continued by increasing the heat to which the\r\nvessel is exposed, until a very considerable portion of the air has\r\nbeen expelled. If the orifice by which the air has escaped be then\r\nclosed, and the vessel be allowed to cool, the air within, by having\r\nits temperature reduced to that of the external air, will lose all\r\nthe elasticity which it had gained from the heat, and will be in the\r\nsame condition as if an equivalent quantity of air had been\r\nwithdrawn by any mechanical agent. The external air, therefore, will\r\nhave a tendency to rush in with a force corresponding to the\r\ndifference of pressures.\r\n\r\nThe process of filling thermometers with mercury shows one use of\r\nproducing a high degree of rarefaction by heat. To construct the\r\ninstrument it is necessary to fill the bulb and a part of the tube\r\nwith mercury; but the bore of the tube is so small that the\r\nmercury cannot be introduced by any ordinary means. It is\r\ntherefore held over flame until heated to a high temperature. The\r\nair within it gradually increasing in pressure as its temperature\r\nis raised, is forced through the small bore of the tube, until the\r\npressure of the air within becomes no more than equal to the\r\npressure of the external atmosphere; this air being so rarefied\r\nthat quantity in the bulb bears a very small proportion to its\r\ncontents at common temperatures. The mouth of the tube is then\r\nplunged into mercury, and as the bulb cools, the air within it\r\nloses its elasticity, and the superior pressure upon the external\r\nsurface forces the mercury into the tube. This continues until the\r\nair remaining within the bulb has been so contracted, that its\r\npressure combined with the weight of the mercury, shall balance\r\nthe atmospheric pressure. The tube is then reversed, and the air\r\nwhich remained rises in a bubble to the surface, and escapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n(28.) Let us now return to the proceedings of Papin. How great a\r\npower would result from such a machine as he conceived, will be\r\napparent, if it be considered that the unresisted atmosphere\r\nexercises a pressure of about fifteen pounds on [Pg045] each\r\nsquare inch of surface exposed to it, and that if the piston in\r\nthe cylinder imagined by Papin, had a diameter of only one foot,\r\nits superficial magnitude would be about 114 square inches. The\r\npressure of the atmosphere upon it, therefore, would be 114 times\r\nfifteen pounds, or 1710 pounds. Papin first proposed to produce\r\nthe vacuum under the piston by means of common air pumps, worked\r\nby a water-wheel; and by such means he conceived that the power of\r\na river, stream, or waterfall might be conveyed by pipes to a\r\ndistance. While he was in England, in 1687, he laid his\r\ncontrivance before the Royal Society of London, but was met by\r\nobjections and difficulties, the nature of which he does not\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, apparent, from what has been already explained,\r\nthat such a method of proceeding would amount to a mere transfer\r\nof power, and would not, properly speaking, be itself a moving\r\nforce: the moving power would, in reality, be the force of the\r\nwater by which the water-wheel would be driven; and the air-pumps,\r\ntubes, together with the piston and cylinder, would be merely\r\nmeans of conveying the power of the water-wheel to the objects to\r\nbe moved, or the machinery to be driven. Papin states, that, long\r\nbefore this, he had attempted to expel the air from his cylinder\r\nby means of gunpowder; but, notwithstanding all the precautions\r\nwhich he could take, there always remained a considerable\r\nquantity; so much, indeed, as to deprive the vacuum of more than\r\nhalf its proper force. At length he adopted an expedient for the\r\nproduction of a vacuum which forms a most important step in the\r\nprogressive invention of the steam engine, and which gives to\r\nPapin's name a high place in the history of that machine. This\r\nmethod is explained in the following paragraph of a work published\r\nby Papin in 1695, at Cassel, entitled \"_Recueil de diverses Pièces\r\ntouchant quelques nouvelles Machines_\", p. 53.\r\n\r\n\"I have endeavoured,\" says he, \"to attain this end (viz. the\r\nproduction of a vacuum in the cylinder) in another way. As water\r\nhas the property of elasticity, when converted into steam by heat,\r\nand afterwards of being so completely recondensed by cold, that\r\nthere does not remain the least [Pg046] appearance of this\r\nelasticity, I have thought that it would not be difficult to work\r\nmachines in which, by means of a moderate heat and at a small\r\ncost, water might produce that perfect vacuum which has vainly\r\nbeen sought by means of gunpowder.\"\r\n\r\nThis remarkable passage is given in the work just cited, as an\r\nextract from the \"Leipsic Acts,\" of August, 1690.\r\n\r\nLet us pause here to explain more fully this important discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n(29.) We have explained that, in its conversion into vapour, by\r\nthe application of heat, water, besides acquiring the property of\r\nelasticity, undergoes a vast enlargement of bulk, filling, under\r\nordinary circumstances, about 1700 times more space than it\r\noccupied in the liquid form. This fact was known generally, though\r\nnot with numerical accuracy, by Papin, having been the foundation\r\nof the machines previously invented and published by De Caus and\r\nLord Worcester; the happy idea of reversing the process occurred\r\nto him. If water in its conversion into steam swelled into many\r\nhundred times its original bulk, it would necessarily follow, that\r\nsteam, being reconverted into water, would shrink into its\r\nprimitive dimensions. Papin therefore saw, that if he could by any\r\nmeans expel the air from his cylinder under the piston, and\r\nreplace it by the pure vapour of water, he could cause that vapour\r\nto be reconverted into a comparatively minute quantity of water by\r\ndepriving it of the heat which sustained it in the state of steam,\r\nand that by accomplishing this, the space in the cylinder under\r\nthe piston would become a vacuum; that by such means, the pressure\r\nof the atmosphere above the piston would take full effect, and\r\nwould urge the piston down; that by introducing more steam under\r\nthe piston, it might be again raised by the elastic force of the\r\nsteam, the destruction of which by cold water would again produce\r\nthe descent of the piston with the same mechanical force; and that\r\nin this way the alternate ascent and descent of the piston might\r\nbe continued indefinitely.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with these ideas, Papin constructed a model\r\nconsisting of a small cylinder, in which was placed a solid\r\npiston; [Pg047] and in the bottom of the cylinder under the\r\npiston was contained in a small quantity of water. The piston\r\nbeing in immediate contact with this water, so as to exclude the\r\natmospheric air, on applying fire to the bottom of the cylinder,\r\nsteam was produced, the elastic force of which raised the piston\r\nto the top of the cylinder; the fire being then removed, and the\r\ncylinder being cooled by the surrounding air, the steam was\r\ncondensed and reconverted into water, leaving a vacuum in the\r\ncylinder into which the piston was pressed by the force of the\r\natmosphere. The fire being applied and subsequently removed,\r\nanother ascent and descent were accomplished; and in the same\r\nmanner the alternate motion of the piston might be continued.\r\nPapin described no other form of machine by which this property\r\ncould be rendered available in practice; but he states generally,\r\nthat the same end may be attained by various forms of machines\r\neasy to be imagined.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SAVERY, 1698.\r\n\r\n\r\n(30.) The discovery of the method of making a vacuum by the\r\ncondensation of steam was reproduced, before 1698, by Captain\r\nThomas Savery, to whom a patent was granted in that year for a\r\nsteam engine to be applied to the raising of water, &c. Savery\r\nproposed to combine the machine described by the Marquis of\r\nWorcester with an apparatus for raising water by suction into a\r\nvacuum produced by the condensation of steam.\r\n\r\nSavery appears to have been ignorant of the publication of Papin,\r\nand stated that his discovery of the condensing principle arose\r\nfrom the following circumstance:—\r\n\r\nHaving drunk a flask of Florence at a tavern, and flung the empty\r\nflask on the fire, he called for a basin of water to wash his\r\nhands. A small quantity which remained in the flask began to boil,\r\nand steam issued from its mouth. It occurred to him to try what\r\neffect would be produced by inverting the flask and plunging its\r\nmouth in the cold water. Putting on a thick glove to defend his\r\nhand from the heat, he seized the [Pg048] flask, and the moment\r\nhe plunged its mouth in the water the liquid immediately rushed up\r\ninto the flask and filled it.\r\n\r\nSavery stated that this circumstance immediately suggested to him\r\nthe possibility of giving effect to the atmospheric pressure by\r\ncreating a vacuum in this manner. He thought that if, instead of\r\nexhausting the barrel of a pump by the usual laborious method of a\r\npiston and sucker, it was exhausted by first filling it with\r\nsteam, and then condensing the same steam, the atmospheric\r\npressure would force the water from the well into the pump-barrel,\r\nand into any vessel connected with it, provided that vessel were\r\nnot more than about thirty-four feet above the elevation of the\r\nwater in the well. He perceived also, that, having lifted the\r\nwater to this height, he might use the elastic force of steam in\r\nthe manner described by the Marquis of Worcester to raise the same\r\nwater to a still greater elevation, and that the same steam which\r\naccomplished this mechanical effect would serve, by its subsequent\r\ncondensation, to reproduce the vacuum, and draw up more water. It\r\nwas on this principle that Savery constructed the first engine in\r\nwhich steam was ever brought into practical operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRANCA'S ENGINE.]\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [1] Arago, Eloge historique de James Watt; p. 22.\r\n\r\n  [2] Ibid., p. 21. note.\r\n\r\n  [3] Farey, Treatise on the Steam Engine, p. 93.\r\n\r\n  [4] Arago, sur les Machines à Vapeur, Annuaire, 1829, p. 165\r\n\r\n  [5] SPIRITUS, _breath_ or _air_.\r\n\r\n  [6] Exactly 15·68 oz. = 0·98 lb.\r\n\r\n  [7] This experiment with the tube A requires to be very\r\n  carefully executed, and the tube should be one of small bore.\r\n\r\n  [8] Recueil de diverses Pièces touchant quelques nouvelles\r\n  Machines, p. 38.\r\n\r\n[Pg049]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAVERY'S ENGINE.]\r\n\r\nCHAP.

The steam engine contrived by Savery, like every other which\r\nhas since been constructed, consists of two parts, essentially\r\ndistinct. The first is that which is employed to [Pg050] generate\r\nthe steam, which is called the boiler; and the second, that in\r\nwhich the steam is applied as a moving power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 11.]\r\n\r\nThe former apparatus in Savery's engine consists of two strong\r\nboilers, sections of which are represented at D and E in _fig._\r\n11.; D the greater boiler, and E the less. The tubes T and T′\r\ncommunicate with the working apparatus, which we shall presently\r\ndescribe. A thin plate of metal R, is applied closely to the top\r\nof the great boiler D, turning on a centre C, so that by moving a\r\nlever applied to the axis C on the outside of the top, the sliding\r\nplate R can be brought from the mouth of the one tube to the mouth\r\nof the other alternately. This sliding valve is called the\r\n_regulator_, since it is by it that the communications between the\r\nboiler and two steam vessels (hereafter described) are alternately\r\nopened and closed, the lever which effects this being moved at\r\nintervals by the hand of the attendant.\r\n\r\nTwo _gauge cocks_ are represented at G, G′, the use of which is to\r\ndetermine the depth of water in the boiler. One, G, has its lower\r\naperture a little above the proper depth; and the other, G′, a\r\nlittle below it. Cocks are attached to the upper ends G, G′, which\r\ncan be opened or closed at pleasure. The steam collected in the\r\ntop of the boiler pressing on the surface of the water, forces it\r\nup in the tubes G, G′, if their lower ends be immersed. Upon\r\nopening the cocks G, G′, if water be forced from both, there is\r\ntoo much water in the boiler, since the mouth of G is _below_ its\r\nlevel. If steam issue from both, there is too little water in the\r\nboiler, since the mouth of G′ is _above_ its level. But if steam\r\nissue from G, and water from G′, the water in the boiler is at its\r\nproper level. This ingenious contrivance for determining the level\r\nof the water in the boiler is the invention of Savery, and is used\r\nin many instances at the present day.\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the pipe G should be at a level of a little less\r\n[Pg051] than one third of the whole depth, and the mouth of G′ at\r\na level little lower than one third; for it is requisite that\r\nabout two thirds of the boiler should be kept filled with water.\r\nThe tube I forms a communication between the greater boiler D and\r\nthe lesser or feeding boiler E, descending nearly to the bottom of\r\nit. This communication can be opened and closed at pleasure by the\r\ncock K. A gauge pipe is inserted similar to G, G′, but extending\r\nnearly to the bottom. From this boiler a tube F extends, which is\r\ncontinued to a cistern C (_fig._ 12.), and a cock is placed at M,\r\nwhich, when opened, allows the water from the cistern to flow into\r\nthe feeding boiler E, and which is closed when that boiler is\r\nfilled. The manner in which this cistern is supplied will be\r\ndescribed hereafter.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose that the principal boiler is filled to the\r\nlevel between the gauge pipes, and that the subsidiary boiler is\r\nnearly full of water, the cock K and the gauge cocks G G′ being\r\nall closed. The fire being lighted beneath D, and the water\r\nboiled, steam is produced, and is transmitted through one or other\r\nof the tubes T, T′, to the working apparatus. When evaporation has\r\nreduced the water in D below the level of G′, it will be necessary\r\nto replenish the boiler D. This is effected thus:—A fire being\r\nlighted beneath the feeding boiler E, steam is produced in it\r\nabove the surface of the water, which, having no escape, presses\r\non the surface so as to force it up in the pipe I. The cock K\r\nbeing then opened, the boiling water is forced into the principal\r\nboiler D, into which it is allowed to flow until water issues from\r\nthe gauge cock G′. When this takes place, the cock K is closed,\r\nand the fire removed from E until the great boiler again wants\r\nreplenishing. When the feeding boiler E has been exhausted, it is\r\nreplenished from the cistern C (_fig._ 12.), through the pipe F,\r\nby opening the cock M.\r\n\r\n\r\n(32.) We shall now describe the working apparatus in which the\r\nsteam is used as a moving power.\r\n\r\nLet V V′ (_fig._ 12.) be two steam vessels communicating by the\r\ntubes T T′ (marked by the same letters in _fig._ 11.) with the\r\ngreater boiler D.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 12.]\r\n\r\nLet S be a pipe, called the _suction pipe_, descending into\r\n[Pg052] the well or reservoir from which the water is to be\r\nraised, and communicating with each of the steam vessels through\r\ntubes D D′, by valves A A′, which open upwards. Let F be a pipe\r\ncontinued from the level of the engine to whatever higher level it\r\nis intended to elevate the water. The steam vessels V V′\r\ncommunicate with the _force-pipe_ F by valves B B′, which open\r\nupwards, through the tubes E E′. Over the steam vessels and on the\r\nforce-pipe is placed a small cistern C, already mentioned, which\r\nis kept filled with cold water from the force-pipe, and from the\r\nbottom of which proceeds a pipe terminated with a cock G. This is\r\ncalled the _condensing pipe_, and can be brought alternately over\r\neach steam vessel. From this cistern another pipe communicates\r\nwith the feeding boiler (_fig._ 11.), by the cock M.[9]\r\n\r\nThe communication of the pipes T T′ with the boiler can be opened\r\nand closed alternately, by the regulator R (_fig._ 11.), already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nNow suppose the steam vessels and tubes to be all filled with\r\ncommon atmospheric air, and that the regulator be placed so that\r\nthe communication between the tube T and the boiler be opened, the\r\ncommunication between the other tube T′ and the boiler being\r\nclosed, steam will flow into V through T. At first, while the\r\nvessel V is cold, the steam will be condensed, and will fall in\r\ndrops of water on the bottom and sides of the vessel. The\r\ncontinued supply of steam from the boiler will at length impart\r\nsuch a degree of heat to the vessel V, that it will cease to\r\ncondense it. Mixed with the heated air [Pg053] contained in the\r\nvessel V, it will have an elastic force greater than the\r\natmospheric pressure, and will therefore force open the valve B,\r\nthrough which a mixture of air and steam will be driven until all\r\nthe air in the vessel V will have passed out, and it will contain\r\nnothing but the pure vapour of water.\r\n\r\nWhen this has taken place, suppose the regulator be moved so as to\r\nclose the communication between the tube T and the boiler, and to\r\nstop the further supply of steam to the vessel V; and at the same\r\ntime let the condensing pipe G be brought over the vessel V, and\r\nthe cock opened so as to let a stream of cold water flow upon it.\r\nThis will cool the vessel V, and the steam with which it is filled\r\nwill be condensed and fall in a few drops of water, leaving the\r\ninterior of the vessel a vacuum. The valve B will be kept closed\r\nby the atmospheric pressure. But the elastic force of the air\r\nbetween the valve A and the surface of the water in the well, or\r\nreservoir, will open A, so that a part of this air will rush in,\r\nand occupy the vessel V. The air in the suction pipe S, being thus\r\nallowed an increased space, will be proportionally diminished in\r\nits elastic force, and its pressure will no longer balance that of\r\nthe atmosphere acting on the external surface of the water in the\r\nreservoir. This pressure will, therefore, force water up in the\r\ntube S until its weight, together with the elastic force of the\r\nair above it, balances the atmospheric pressure. When this has\r\ntaken place, the water will cease to ascend.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose that, by shifting the regulator, the\r\ncommunication is opened between T and the boiler, so that steam\r\nflows again into V. The condensing cock G being removed, the\r\nvessel will be again heated as before, the air expelled, and its\r\nplace filled by the steam. The condensing pipe being again allowed\r\nto play upon the vessel V, and the further supply of steam being\r\nstopped, a vacuum will be produced in V, and the atmospheric\r\npressure will force the water through the valve A into the vessel\r\nV, which it will nearly fill, a small quantity of air, however,\r\nremaining above it.\r\n\r\nThus far the mechanical agency employed in elevating the water is\r\nthe atmospheric pressure; and the power of steam is no further\r\nemployed than in the production of a vacuum. [Pg054] But, in\r\norder to continue the elevation of the water through the force\r\npipe F, above the level of the steam vessel, it will be necessary\r\nto use the elastic pressure of the steam. The vessel V is now\r\nnearly filled by the water which has been forced into it by the\r\natmosphere. Let us suppose that, the regulator being shifted\r\nagain, the communication between the tube T and the boiler is\r\nopened, the condensing cock removed, and that steam flows into V.\r\nAt first, coming in contact with the cold surface of the water and\r\nthat of the vessel, it is condensed; but the vessel is soon\r\nheated, and the water formed by the condensed steam collects in a\r\nsheet or film upon the surface of the water in V, so as to form a\r\nsurface as hot as boiling water.[10] The steam then being no\r\nlonger condensed, presses on the surface of the water with its\r\nelastic force; and when that pressure becomes greater than the\r\natmospheric pressure, the valve B is forced open, and the water\r\nissuing through it, passes through E into the force-pipe F; and\r\nthis is continued until the steam has forced all the water from V,\r\nand occupies its place.\r\n\r\nThe further admission of steam through T is once more stopped by\r\nmoving the regulator; and the condensing pipe being again allowed\r\nto play on V, so as to condense the steam which fills it, produces\r\na vacuum. Into this vacuum, as before, the atmospheric pressure\r\nwill force the water, and fill the vessel V. The condensing pipe\r\nbeing then closed, and steam admitted through T, the water in V\r\nwill be forced by its pressure through the valve B and tube E into\r\nF, and so the process is continued.\r\n\r\nWe have not yet noticed the other steam vessel V′, which, as far\r\nas we have described, would have remained filled with common\r\natmospheric air, the pressure of which on the valve A′ would have\r\nprevented the water raised in the suction pipe S from passing\r\nthrough it. However, this is not the case; for, during the entire\r\nprocess which has been described in V, similar effects have been\r\nproduced in V′, which we have only omitted to notice to avoid the\r\nconfusion which the two processes might produce. It will be\r\nremembered, that after the steam, in the first instance, having\r\nflowed from the boiler [Pg055] through T, has blown the air out\r\nof V through B, the communication between T and the boiler is\r\nclosed. Now the same motion of the regulator which closes this,\r\nopens the communication between T′ and the boiler; for the sliding\r\nplate R (_fig._ 11.) is moved from the one tube to the other, and\r\nat the same time, as we have already stated, the condensing pipe\r\nis brought to play on V. While, therefore, a vacuum is being\r\nformed in V by condensation, the steam, flowing through T′, blows\r\nout the air through B′, as already described in the other vessel\r\nV; and while the air in S is rushing up through A into V, followed\r\nby the water raised in S by the atmospheric pressure, the vessel\r\nV′ is being filled with steam, and the air is completely expelled\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nThe communication between T and the boiler is now again opened,\r\nand the communication between T′ and the boiler closed by moving\r\nthe regulator R (_fig._ 11.) from the tube T to T′; at the same\r\ntime the condensing pipe is removed from over V, and brought to\r\nplay upon V′. While the steam once more expels the air from V\r\nthrough B, a vacuum is formed by condensation in V′, into which\r\nthe water in S rushes through the valve A′. In the mean time V is\r\nagain filled with steam. The communication between T and the\r\nboiler is now closed, and that between T′ and the boiler is\r\nopened, and the condensing pipe removed from V′, and brought to\r\nplay on V. While the steam from the boiler forces the water in V′\r\nthrough B′ into the force-pipe F, a vacuum is being produced in V,\r\ninto which water is raised by the atmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nThus each of the vessels V V′ is alternately filled from S, and\r\nthe water thence forced into F. The same steam which forces the\r\nwater from the vessels into F, having done its duty, is condensed,\r\nand brings up the water from S, by giving effect to the\r\natmospheric pressure.\r\n\r\nDuring this process, two alternate motions or adjustments must be\r\nconstantly made; the communication between T and the boiler must\r\nbe opened, and that between T′ and the boiler closed, which is\r\ndone by one motion of the regulator. The condensing pipe at the\r\nsame time must be brought from V to play on V′, which is done by\r\nthe lever placed upon it. Again [Pg056] the communication between\r\nT′ and the boiler is to be opened, and that between T and the\r\nboiler closed; this is done by moving back the regulator. The\r\ncondensing pipe is brought from V′ to V by moving back the other\r\nlever, and so on alternately.\r\n\r\nFor the clearness and convenience of description, some slight and\r\notherwise unimportant changes have been made in the position of\r\nthe parts. A perspective view of this engine is represented at the\r\nhead of this chapter. The different parts already described will\r\neasily be recognised.\r\n\r\nThe engine of Savery was very clearly described in a small work\r\npublished in London in 1702, entitled, _The Miner's Friend, or an\r\nEngine to raise Water by Fire described, and the Manner of Fixing\r\nit in Mines; with an Account of the several Uses it is applicable\r\nunto, and an Answer to the Objection made against it; by Thomas\r\nSavery, Gentleman_. This volume was dedicated to William III. (to\r\nwhom the engine had been exhibited at Hampton Court palace), to\r\nthe Royal Society, and to the mining adventurers of England. The\r\nfollowing are the uses to which Savery proposed the engine should\r\nbe applied: _First_, to raise water for turning all sorts of\r\nmills; _second_, supplying palaces and houses with water, and\r\nsupplying means of extinguishing fire therein by the water so\r\nraised; _third_, the supplying cities and towns with water;\r\n_fourth_, draining fens or marshes; _fifth_, for ships; _sixth_,\r\nthe drainage of mines.\r\n\r\nDr. Harris, in his _Lexicon Technicum, or Dictionary of Arts and\r\nSciences_, mentions a machine of Savery's for propelling a vessel\r\nin a calm, by paddle-wheels placed at the side; but it does not\r\nappear that Savery contemplated the application of a steam engine\r\nto work these wheels.\r\n\r\nIt is only from scattered passages in publications of the day that\r\nit can be ascertained to what extent the engines of Savery were\r\npractically applied. In his address to the Royal Society, he\r\nspeaks of the \"difficulties and expense which he encountered in\r\ninstructing artisans to make engines according to his wish; but\r\nthat after much experience the workmen had become such masters of\r\nthe thing, that they bound themselves to deliver the engines\r\n'exactly tight and fit for [Pg057] service, and such as he\r\n(Savery) dare warrant them to every one that has occasion for\r\nthem.'\"\r\n\r\nIn his address to the miners of England he also says, \"that the\r\nfrequent disorders and cumbersomeness of water engines then in use\r\nencouraged him to invent engines to work by this new force; that\r\nthough they were obliged to encounter the oddest and almost\r\ninsuperable difficulties, yet he spared neither time, pains, nor\r\nmoney, till he had conquered them.\"\r\n\r\nIn Bradley's _Improvements of Planting and Gardening_, 1718, the\r\nauthor thus speaks of an engine erected by Savery:—\r\n\r\n\"Supposing the situation of a house or garden to be a considerable\r\nheight above any pond, river, or spring, and that it has at\r\npresent no other conveniency of water than what is brought\r\ncontinually by men or horses to it. In this case, the wonderful\r\ninvention of the late Mr. Savery, F.R.S., for raising water by\r\nfire, will not only supply the defect, by flinging up as much\r\nwater as may be desired, but may be maintained with very little\r\ntrouble and very small expense.\r\n\r\n\"It is now about six years since Mr. Savery set up one of them for\r\nthat curious gentleman Mr. Balle, at Cambden House, Kensington,\r\nnear London, which has succeeded so well that there has not been\r\nany want of water since it has been built; and, with the\r\nimprovements since made to it, I am apt to believe will be less\r\nsubject to be out of order than any engine whatever.\"\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that, notwithstanding the high pressure steam\r\nnecessary for the operation of Savery's engine, he does not appear\r\nto have adopted the obvious expedient of a safety valve. The\r\nsafety valve had been previously known, having been invented about\r\nthe year 1681, by Papin, for his digester, which was a close\r\nboiler, contrived by him for stewing meat and digesting bones, by\r\nsubmitting them to a higher temperature than that of water boiling\r\nin an open vessel.\r\n\r\nThe safety valve which has ever since been used for steam boilers\r\nof every kind is a valve which opens outwards, and is fitted to an\r\naperture in the boiler, so as to be steam tight. It is pressed\r\ndown by a weight, the amount of which is regulated by the maximum\r\npressure to which it is intended the steam [Pg058] shall be\r\nlimited. Thus, if the magnitude of the valve be a square inch, and\r\nthe pressure of the steam be limited to 10 lbs. per square inch\r\nabove the pressure of the atmosphere, then the valve would be\r\nloaded with a weight of 10 lbs.; but as it was found necessary to\r\nvary from time to time the limiting pressure of the steam, or the\r\nload of the safety valve, these valves were usually constructed so\r\nas to be held down by the pressure of a lever having a sliding\r\nweight upon it. By moving the weight on the arm of the lever, the\r\npressure on the valve could be increased or diminished at the\r\ndiscretion of the engineer. This contrivance was first applied to\r\nSavery's engines, by Desaguliers, about the year 1717, before\r\nwhich year Savery died.\r\n\r\nIt is justly observed by Mr. Farey, in his treatise on the steam\r\nengine, that, \"when a comparison is made between Captain[11]\r\nSavery's engine and those of his predecessors, the result will be\r\nin every respect favourable to his character as an inventor, and\r\nas a practical engineer; all the details of his invention are made\r\nout in a masterly style, and accidents and contingencies are\r\nprovided for, so as to render it a real working engine; whereas De\r\nCaus, the Marquis of Worcester, Sir Samuel Morland, and Papin,\r\nthough ingenious philosophers, only produced mere outlines, which\r\nrequired great labour and skill of subsequent inventors to fill\r\nup, and make them sufficiently complete to be put in execution.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1718 further improvements were made in the\r\nconstruction of Savery's engine, by Dr. Desaguliers; but it is\r\nprobable that some of these were suggested by the proceedings of\r\nthe inventors of the atmospheric engine, which shall presently\r\ndescribe.\r\n\r\n\r\n(33.) In order duly to appreciate the value of improvements, it is\r\nnecessary first to perceive the defects which these improvements\r\nare designed to remove. Savery's steam engine, considering how\r\nlittle was known of the value and properties of steam, and how low\r\nthe general standard of mechanical knowledge was in his day, is\r\ncertainly highly [Pg059] creditable to his genius. Nevertheless\r\nit had very considerable defects, and was finally found to be\r\ninefficient for the most important purposes to which he proposed\r\napplying it.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this invention, the mines in England had greatly\r\nincreased in depth, and the process of draining them had become\r\nboth expensive and difficult; so much so, that it was found in\r\nmany instances that their produce did not cover the cost of\r\nworking them. The drainage of these mines was the most important\r\npurpose to which Savery proposed to apply his steam engine.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated that the pressure of the atmosphere\r\namounts to about fifteen pounds on every square inch. Now, a\r\ncolumn of water, whose base is one square inch, and whose height\r\nis thirty-four feet, weighs about fifteen pounds. If we suppose\r\nthat a perfect vacuum were produced in the steam vessels V V′\r\n(_fig._ 12.) by condensation, the atmospheric pressure would fail\r\nto force up the water, if the height of the top of these vessels\r\nabove the water to be raised exceeded thirty-four feet. It is\r\nplain, therefore, that the engine cannot be more than thirty-four\r\nfeet above the water which it is intended to elevate. But in fact\r\nit cannot be so much; for the vacuum produced in the steam vessels\r\nV V′ is never perfect. Water, when not submitted to the pressure\r\nof the atmosphere, will vaporise at a very low temperature, as we\r\nshall hereafter explain; and it was found that a vapour possessing\r\na considerable elasticity would, notwithstanding the condensation,\r\nremain in the vessels V V′ and the pipe S, and would oppose the\r\nascent of the water. In consequence of this, the engine could\r\nnever be placed with practical advantage at a greater height than\r\ntwenty-six feet above the level of the water to be raised.\r\n\r\n\r\n(34.) When the water is elevated to the engine, and the steam\r\nvessels filled, if steam be introduced above the water in V, it\r\nmust first balance the atmospheric pressure, before it can force\r\nthe water through the valve B. Here, then, is a mechanical\r\npressure of fifteen pounds per square inch expended, without any\r\nwater being raised by it. If steam of twice that elastic force be\r\nused, it will elevate a column in F of thirty-four feet in height;\r\nand if steam of triple the force be used, it will raise a column\r\nof sixty-eight feet high, [Pg060] which, added to twenty-six feet\r\nraised by the atmosphere, gives a total lift of ninety-four feet.\r\n\r\nIn effecting this, steam of a pressure equal to three times that\r\nof the atmosphere acts on the inner surface of the vessels V V′.\r\nOne third of this bursting pressure is balanced by the pressure of\r\nthe atmosphere on the external surface of the vessels; but an\r\neffective pressure of thirty pounds per square inch still remains,\r\ntending to burst the vessels. It was found that the apparatus\r\ncould not be constructed to bear more than this with safety; and,\r\ntherefore, in practice, the lift of such an engine was limited to\r\nabout ninety perpendicular feet. In order to raise the water from\r\nthe bottom of the mine by these engines, therefore, it was\r\nnecessary to place one at every ninety feet of the depth; so that\r\nthe water raised by one through the first ninety feet should be\r\nreceived in a reservoir, from which it was to be elevated the next\r\nninety feet by another, and so on.\r\n\r\nBesides this, it was found that sufficient strength could not be\r\ngiven to those engines, if constructed upon a large scale.\r\n\r\nThey were, therefore, necessarily very limited in their\r\ndimensions, and were incapable of raising the water with\r\nsufficient speed. Hence arose a necessity for several engines at\r\neach level, which greatly increased the expense.\r\n\r\n\r\n(35.) These, however, were not the only defects of Savery's\r\nengines. The consumption of fuel was enormous, the proportion of\r\nheat wasted being much more than what was used in either forcing\r\nup the water, or producing a _vacuum_. This will be very easily\r\nunderstood by attending to the process of working the engine\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\nWhen the steam is first introduced from the boiler into the steam\r\nvessels V V′, preparatory to the formation of a vacuum, it is\r\nnecessary that it should heat these vessels up to the temperature\r\nof the steam itself; for until then the steam will be condensed\r\nthe moment it enters the vessel by the cold surface. All this\r\nheat, therefore, spent in raising the temperature of the steam\r\nvessels is wasted. Again, when the water has ascended and filled\r\nthe vessels V V′, and steam is introduced to force this water\r\nthrough B B′ into F, it is immediately condensed by the cold\r\nsurface in V V′, and does not [Pg061] begin to act until a\r\nquantity of hot water, formed by condensed steam, is collected on\r\nthe surface of the cold water which fills these vessels. Hence\r\nanother source of the waste of heat arises.\r\n\r\nWhen the steam begins to act upon the surface of the water in V\r\nV′, and to force it down, the cold surface of the vessels is\r\ngradually exposed to the steam, and must be heated while the steam\r\ncontinues its action; and when the water has been forced out of\r\nthe vessel, the vessel itself has been heated to the temperature\r\nof the steam which fills it, all which heat is dissipated by the\r\nsubsequent process of condensation. It must thus be evident that\r\nthe steam used in forcing up the the water in F, and in producing\r\na vacuum, bears a very small proportion indeed to what is consumed\r\nin heating the apparatus after condensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n(36.) There is also another circumstance which increases the\r\nconsumption of fuel. The water must be forced through B, not only\r\nagainst the atmospheric pressure, but also against a column of\r\nsixty-eight feet of water. Steam is therefore required of a\r\npressure of forty-five pounds on the square inch. Consequently the\r\nwater in the boiler must be boiled under this pressure. That this\r\nshould take place, it is necessary that the water should be raised\r\nto a temperature considerably above 212°, even so high as 275°;\r\nand thus an increased heat must be given to the boiler.\r\nIndependently of the other defects, this intense heat weakened and\r\ngradually destroyed the apparatus.\r\n\r\nSavery was the first who suggested the method of expressing the\r\npower of an engine with reference to that of horses. In this\r\ncomparison, however, he supposed each horse to work but eight\r\nhours a day, while the engine works for twenty-four hours. This\r\nmethod of expressing the power of steam engines will be explained\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n(37.) The failure of the engines proposed by Captain Savery in the\r\nwork of drainage, from the causes which have been just mentioned,\r\nand the increasing necessity for effecting this object, arising\r\nfrom the large property in mines which became every year\r\nunproductive by being flooded, stimulated the ingenuity [Pg062]\r\nof mechanics to contrive some means of rendering those powers of\r\nsteam exhibited in Savery's engine available.\r\n\r\nThomas Newcomen, the reputed inventor of the atmospheric engine, was\r\nan ironmonger, or, according to some, a blacksmith, in the town of\r\nDartmouth in Devonshire. From his personal acquaintance and\r\nintercourse with Dr. Hooke, the celebrated natural philosopher, it\r\nis probable that he was a person of some education, and therefore\r\nlikely to be above the position of a blacksmith. Being in the habit\r\nof visiting the tin mines in Cornwall, Newcomen became acquainted\r\nwith the engine invented by Savery, and with the causes which led to\r\nits inefficiency for the purposes of drainage.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that Papin, about the year 1690, proposed the\r\nconstruction of an engine working by the atmospheric pressure\r\nacting on one side of a piston against a vacuum produced by the\r\ncondensation of steam on the other side. Papin was not conscious\r\nof the importance of this principle; for, so far from ever having\r\nattempted to apply it to practical purposes, he probably never\r\nconstructed, even on a small scale, any machine illustrating it.\r\nOn the contrary, he abandoned the project the moment he was\r\ninformed of the principle and structure of the steam engine of\r\nSavery; and he then proposed an engine for raising water, acting\r\nby the expansive force of steam similar to Savery's, but\r\nabandoning the method of working by a vacuum.\r\n\r\nThis engine is described by Papin in a work published in 1707.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 13.]\r\n\r\nA (_fig._ 13.) is an oval boiler, having a safety-valve B, which\r\nlimits the pressure of the steam. It is connected with a cylinder\r\nC, by a curved pipe having a stop-cock at D. A pipe with a\r\nstop-cock G opens from the top of the cylinder into the\r\natmosphere, and a safety-valve F is placed upon the cylinder. A\r\nhollow copper piston H moves freely in the cylinder, and floats\r\nupon the water. O is a funnel with a valve L in the bottom,\r\nopening downwards, through which the cylinder C may be filled with\r\nwater to the level of the top of the funnel. A close air-vessel\r\ncommunicates with the cylinder C by the curved tube, and has a\r\nvalve K opening upwards. The force-pipe through which the water is\r\nraised communicates [Pg063] with the air-vessel I. If the cock D\r\nbe shut, and the cock G opened, water poured into the funnel O\r\nwill rise into the cylinder C, the air which fills the cylinder\r\nescaping through the open pipe G. When the cylinder is thus filled\r\nwith water, let the cock G be closed, and the cock D opened. The\r\nsteam from the boiler, after heating the metal of the cylinder,\r\nwill force the piston downwards, and drive the water through the\r\ncurved tube into the vessel I, from which its return is prevented\r\nby the valve K, which is closed by its weight. The air which\r\nfilled the vessel I will then be compressed, and by its elasticity\r\nwill drive a column of water up the pipe N. After the contents of\r\nthe cylinder have been thus discharged it may be refilled in the\r\nsame manner, and the process repeated.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that this project is nothing more than a\r\nreproduction of the engine of the Marquis of Worcester. In the\r\npreface to the work containing this description, Papin gives an\r\nextract from a letter addressed by him to Leibnitz in 1698, from\r\nwhich it appears that he had abandoned his idea of working the\r\npiston by the atmospheric pressure acting against a vacuum,\r\nconsidering it to be a contrivance inferior [Pg064] to the engine\r\nnow described. \"We now raise water,\" he says, \"by the force of\r\nfire, _in a more advantageous manner than that which I had\r\npublished some years before_; for besides the suction, we now also\r\nuse the pressure which the water exerts upon other bodies in\r\ndilating itself by heat; instead of which I before employed the\r\nsuction only, the effects of which are more limited.\"\r\n\r\nFrom documents which have been preserved in the Royal Society, it\r\nappears that Newcomen was acquainted with Papin's writings, and\r\ntherefore probably first derived from them the suggestion which he\r\nsubsequently realised in the atmospheric engine. Among some papers\r\nof Dr. Hooke's have been found notes for the use of Newcomen, on\r\nPapin's method of transmitting the force of a stream or fall of\r\nwater to a distance by pipes. Hooke dissuaded Newcomen from\r\nattempting any machine on this principle, which, as first proposed\r\nby Papin, was impracticable. He exposed the fallacy of Papin's\r\nfirst project in several discourses before the Royal Society, and\r\nconsidered his improved edition of it, though free from fallacy,\r\nas impracticable.\r\n\r\nPapin's project for producing a vacuum under a piston by\r\ncondensing the steam having been published in the _Actæ\r\nEruditorum_, in Latin, in 1690, and in French, at Cassel, in 1695,\r\nand subsequently, in the _Philosophical Transactions_, in England\r\nin 1697, cannot be supposed to be unknown to Dr. Hooke; and if\r\nknown to him, would probably have been communicated to Newcomen.\r\nDr. Hooke died in 1703, some years before the date of Newcomen's\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\nJohn Cawley, who was the associate of Newcomen in his experiments\r\nand inquiries, was a plumber and glazier of the same town.\r\nNewcomen and Cawley obtained a patent for the atmospheric engine\r\nin 1705, in which Savery was associated, he having previously\r\nobtained a patent for the method of producing a vacuum by the\r\ncondensation of steam, which was essential to Newcomen's\r\ncontrivance. It was not, however, until about the year 1711 that\r\nany engine had been constructed under this patent.\r\n\r\nIn the latter end of that year, according to Desaguliers, the\r\npatentees \"made proposals to drain a colliery at Griff, in\r\n[Pg065] Warwickshire, in which work five hundred horses were\r\nconstantly employed. This proposal not being accepted, they\r\ncontracted, in the following March, to drain water for Mr. Back of\r\nWolverhampton, where, after many laborious attempts, they\r\nsucceeded in making their engine work; but not being either\r\nphilosophers to understand the reason, or mathematicians enough to\r\ncalculate the power and proportions of the parts, they very\r\nluckily, by accident, found what they sought for.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 14.]\r\n\r\nNewcomen resumed the old method of raising the water from the\r\nmines by ordinary pumps, but conceived the idea of working these\r\npumps by some moving power less expensive than that of horses. The\r\nmeans whereby he proposed effecting this, was by connecting the\r\nend of the pump-rod D (_fig._ 14.) by a chain with the arch head A\r\nof a [Pg066] working-beam A B, playing on an axis C. The other\r\narch head B of this beam was connected by a chain with the rod E\r\nof a solid piston P, which moved air-tight in a cylinder F. If a\r\nvacuum be created beneath the piston P, the atmospheric pressure\r\nacting upon it will press it down with a force of fifteen pounds\r\nper square inch; and the end A of the beam being thus raised, the\r\npump-rod D will be drawn up. If a pressure equivalent to the\r\natmosphere be then introduced below the piston, so as to\r\nneutralise the downward pressure, the piston will be in a state of\r\nindifference as to the rising or falling; and if in this case the\r\nrod D be made heavier than the piston and its rod, so as to\r\novercome the friction, it will descend, and elevate the piston\r\nagain to the top of the cylinder. The vacuum being again produced,\r\nanother descent of the piston, and consequent elevation of the\r\npump-rod, will take place; and so the process may be continued.\r\n\r\nSuch was Newcomen's first conception of the _atmospheric engine_;\r\nand the contrivance had much, even at the first view, to recommend\r\nit. The power of such a machine would depend entirely on the\r\nmagnitude of the piston; and being independent of highly elastic\r\nsteam, would not expose the materials to the destructive heat\r\nwhich was necessary for working Savery's engine. Supposing a\r\nperfect vacuum to be produced under the piston in the cylinder, an\r\neffective downward pressure would be obtained, amounting to\r\nfifteen times as many pounds as there are square inches in the\r\nsection of the piston.[12] Thus, if the base of the piston were\r\n100 square inches, a pressure equal to 1500 pounds would be\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n(38.) In order to accomplish this, two things were necessary: 1.\r\nTo make a speedy and effectual vacuum below the [Pg067] piston in\r\nthe descent; and, 2. To contrive a counterpoise for the atmosphere\r\nin the ascent.\r\n\r\nThe condensation of steam immediately presented itself as the most\r\neffectual means of accomplishing the former; and the elastic force\r\nof the same steam previous to condensation an obvious method of\r\neffecting the latter. Nothing now remained to carry the design\r\ninto execution, but the contrivance of means for the alternate\r\nintroduction and condensation of the steam; and Newcomen and\r\nCawley were accordingly granted a patent in 1707, in which Savery\r\nwas united, in consequence of the principle of condensation for\r\nwhich he had previously received a patent being necessary to the\r\nprojected machine. We shall now describe the _atmospheric engine_,\r\nas first constructed by Newcomen:—\r\n\r\nThe boiler K (_fig._ 14.) is placed over a furnace I, the flue of\r\nwhich winds round it, so as to communicate heat to every part of\r\nthe bottom of it. In the top, which is hemispherical, two\r\ngauge-cocks G G′ are placed, as in Savery's engine, and a _puppet\r\nvalve_ V, which opens upward, and is loaded at one pound per\r\nsquare inch; so that when the steam produced in the boiler exceeds\r\nthe pressure of the atmosphere by more than one pound on the\r\nsquare inch, the valve V is lifted, and the steam escapes through\r\nit, and continues to escape until its pressure is sufficiently\r\ndiminished, when the valve V again falls into its seat. This valve\r\nperforms the office of the safety-valve in modern engines.\r\n\r\nThe great steam-tube is represented at S, which conducts steam\r\nfrom the boiler to the cylinder; and a feeding pipe T, furnished\r\nwith a cock, which is opened and closed at pleasure, proceeds from\r\na cistern L to the boiler. By this pipe the boiler may be\r\nreplenished from the cistern, when the gauge cock G′ indicates\r\nthat the level has fallen below it. The cistern L is supplied with\r\nhot water, by means which we shall presently explain.\r\n\r\n\r\n(39.) To understand the mechanism necessary to work the piston,\r\nlet us consider how the supply and condensation of steam must be\r\nregulated. When the piston has been forced to the bottom of the\r\ncylinder by the atmospheric pressure acting against a vacuum, in\r\norder to balance that pressure, [Pg068] and enable it to be drawn\r\nup by the weight of the pump-rod, it is necessary to introduce\r\nsteam from the boiler. This is accomplished by opening the cock R\r\nin the steam pipe S. The steam being thus introduced from the\r\nboiler, its pressure balances the action of the atmosphere upon\r\nthe piston, which is immediately drawn to the top of the cylinder\r\nby the weight of the pump-rod D. It then becomes necessary to\r\ncondense this steam, in order to produce a vacuum. To accomplish\r\nthis, the further supply of steam must be cut off, which is done\r\nby closing the cock R. The supply of steam from the boiler being\r\nthus suspended, the application of cold water on the external\r\nsurface of the cylinder becomes necessary to condense the steam\r\nwithin it. This was done by enclosing the cylinder within another,\r\nleaving a space between them.[13] Into this space cold water was\r\nallowed to flow from a cock M placed over it, supplied by a pipe\r\nfrom the cistern N. This cistern is supplied with water by a pump\r\nO, which is worked by the engine.\r\n\r\nThe cold water supplied from M, having filled the space between\r\nthe two cylinders, abstracts the heat from the inner one; and\r\ncondensing the steam, produces a vacuum, into which the piston is\r\nforced by the atmospheric pressure. Preparatory to the next\r\ndescent, the water which thus fills the space between the\r\ncylinders, and which is warmed by the heat abstracted from the\r\nsteam, must be discharged, in order to give room for a fresh\r\nsupply of cold water from M. An aperture, furnished with a cock,\r\nis accordingly provided in the bottom of the cylinder, through\r\nwhich the water is discharged into the cistern L; and being warm,\r\nis adapted for the supply of the boiler through T, as already\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe cock R being now again opened, steam is admitted below the\r\npiston, which, as before, ascends, and the descent is again\r\naccomplished by closing the cock R, and opening the cock M,\r\nadmitting cold water between the cylinders, and thereby condensing\r\nthe steam below the piston.\r\n\r\nThe condensed steam, thus reduced to water, will collect [Pg069]\r\nin the bottom of the cylinder, and resist the descent of the\r\npiston. It is therefore necessary to provide an exit for it, which\r\nis done by a valve opening _outwards_ into a tube which leads to\r\nthe feeding cistern L, into which the condensed steam is driven.\r\n\r\nThat the piston should continue to be air-tight, it was necessary\r\nto keep a constant supply of water over it; this was done by a\r\ncock similar to M, which allowed water to flow from the pipe M on\r\nthe piston.\r\n\r\n\r\n(40.) Soon after the first construction of these engines, an\r\naccidental circumstance suggested to Newcomen a much better method\r\nof condensation than the application of cold water on the external\r\nsurface of the cylinder. An engine was observed to work several\r\nstrokes with unusual rapidity, and without the regular supply of\r\nthe condensing water. Upon examining the piston, a hole was found\r\nin it, through which the water, which was poured on to keep it\r\nair-tight, flowed, and instantly condensed the steam under it.\r\n\r\nOn this suggestion Newcomen abandoned the external cylinder, and\r\nintroduced a pipe H, furnished with a cock Q, into the bottom of\r\nthe cylinder, so that, on turning the cock, the pressure of the\r\nwater in the pipe H, from the level of the water in the cistern N,\r\nwould force the water to rise as a jet into the cylinder, and\r\nwould instantly condense the steam. This method of condensing by\r\ninjection formed a very important improvement in the engine, and\r\nis still used.\r\n\r\n\r\n(41.) Having taken a general view of the parts of the atmospheric\r\nengine, let us now consider more particularly its operation.\r\n\r\nWhen the engine is not working, the weight of the pump-rod D\r\n(_fig._ 14.) draws down the beam A, and draws the piston to the\r\ntop of the cylinder, where it rests. Let us suppose all the cocks\r\nand valves closed, and the boiler filled to the proper depth. The\r\nfire being lighted beneath it, the water is boiled until the steam\r\nacquires sufficient force to lift the valve V. When this takes\r\nplace, the engine may be started. For this purpose the regulating\r\nvalve R is opened. The steam rushes in, and is first condensed by\r\nthe cold cylinder. After a short time the cylinder acquires the\r\ntemperature of the steam, which then [Pg070] ceases to be\r\ncondensed, and mixes with the air which filled the cylinder. The\r\nsteam and heated air, having a greater force than the atmospheric\r\npressure, will open a valve placed at the end X of a small tube in\r\nthe bottom of the cylinder, and which opens outwards. From this\r\n(which is called the _blowing valve_[14]) the steam and air rush\r\nin a constant stream, until all the air has been expelled, and the\r\ncylinder is filled with the pure vapour of water. This process is\r\ncalled _blowing_ the engine preparatory to starting it.\r\n\r\nWhen it is about to be started, the engine-man closes the\r\nregulator R, and thereby suspends the supply of steam from the\r\nboiler. At the same time he opens the _condensing valve_ H[15];\r\nand thereby throws up a jet of cold water into the cylinder. This\r\nimmediately condenses the steam contained in the cylinder, and\r\nproduces the vacuum. (The atmosphere cannot enter the _blowing_\r\nvalve, because it opens _outwards_, so that no air can enter to\r\nvitiate the vacuum.) The atmospheric pressure above the piston now\r\ntakes effect, and forces it down in the cylinder. The descent\r\nbeing completed, the engine-man closes the condensing valve H, and\r\nopens the regulator, R. By this means he stops the play of the jet\r\nwithin the cylinder, and admits the steam from the boiler. The\r\nfirst effect of the steam is to expel the condensing water and\r\ncondensed steam which are collected in the bottom of the cylinder,\r\nthrough the tube Y, containing a valve which opens _outwards_\r\n(called the _eduction valve_), which leads to the hot cistern L,\r\ninto which this water is therefore discharged.\r\n\r\nWhen the steam admitted through R ceases to be condensed, it\r\nbalances the atmospheric pressure above the piston, and thus\r\npermits it to be drawn to the top of the cylinder by the weight of\r\nthe rod D. This ascent of the piston is also assisted by the\r\ncircumstance of the steam being somewhat stronger than the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhen the piston has reached the top, the regulating valve R is\r\nclosed, and the condensing valve H opened, and another descent\r\nproduced, as before, and so the process is continued. [Pg071]\r\n\r\nThe manipulation necessary in working this engine was, therefore,\r\nthe alternate opening and closing of two valves; the regulating\r\nand condensing valves. When the piston reached the top of the\r\ncylinder, the former was to be closed, and the latter opened; and,\r\non reaching the bottom, the former was to be opened, and the\r\nlatter closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(42.) The duty of working the engine requiring no great amount of\r\nlabour, or skill, was usually entrusted to boys, called, _cock\r\nboys_. It happened that one of the most important improvements\r\nwhich has ever been made in the working of steam engines was due\r\nto the ingenuity of one of these boys. It is said that a lad,\r\nnamed _Humphrey Potter_, was employed to work the cocks of an\r\natmospheric engine, and being tempted to escape from the\r\nmonotonous drudgery to which his duty confined him, his ingenuity\r\nwas sharpened so as to prompt him to devise some means by which he\r\nmight indulge his disposition to play without exposing himself to\r\nthe consequences of suspending the performance of the engine. On\r\nobserving the alternate ascending and descending motion of the\r\nbeam above him, and considering it in reference to the labour of\r\nhis own hands, in alternately raising and lowering the levers\r\nwhich governed the cocks, he perceived a relation which served as\r\na clue to a simple contrivance, by which the steam engine, for the\r\nfirst time, became an automaton. When the beam arrived at the top\r\nof its play, it was necessary to open the steam valve by raising a\r\nlever, and to close the injection valve by raising another. This\r\nhe saw could be accomplished by attaching strings of proper length\r\nto these levers, and tying them to some part of the beam. These\r\nlevers required to be moved in the opposite direction when the\r\nbeam attained the lowest point of its play. This he saw could be\r\naccomplished by strings, either connected with the outer arm of\r\nthe beam, or conducted over rods or pulleys. In short, he\r\ncontrived means of so connecting the levers which governed the two\r\ncocks by strings with the beam, that the beam opened and closed\r\nthese cocks with the most perfect regularity and certainty as it\r\nmoved upwards and downwards.\r\n\r\nBesides rendering the machine independent of manual [Pg072]\r\nsuperintendence, this process conferred upon it much greater\r\nregularity of performance than any manual superintendence could\r\nensure.\r\n\r\nThis contrivance of Potter was very soon improved by the\r\nsubstitution of a bar, called a _plug frame_, which was suspended\r\nfrom the arm of the beam, and which carried upon it pins, by which\r\nthe arms of the levers governing the cocks were struck as the\r\nplug-frame ascended and descended, so as to be opened and closed\r\nat the proper times.\r\n\r\nThe engine thus improved required no other attendance except to\r\nfeed the boiler occasionally by the cock T, and to attend the\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\n\r\n(43.) However the merit of the discovery of the physical\r\nprinciples on which the mechanical application of steam depends\r\nmay be awarded, it must be admitted that the engine contrived by\r\nNewcomen and his associates, considered as a practical machine,\r\nwas immeasurably superior to that which preceded it; superior,\r\nindeed, to such a degree, that while the one was incapable of any\r\npermanently useful application, the other soon became a machine of\r\nextensive utility in the drainage of mines; and, even at the\r\npresent time, the atmospheric engine is not unfrequently used in\r\npreference to the modern steam engine, in districts where fuel is\r\nabundant and cheap; the expense of constructing and maintaining it\r\nbeing considerably less than that of an improved steam engine. The\r\nlow pressure of the steam used in working it, rendered it\r\nperfectly safe. While Savery's engine, to work with effect,\r\nrequired that the steam confined in the vessels should have a\r\nbursting pressure amounting to about thirty pounds per square\r\ninch, the pressure of steam in the boiler and cylinder of the\r\natmospheric engine required only a pressure about one pound per\r\nsquare inch. The high pressure also of the steam used in Savery's\r\nengine, was necessarily accompanied, as we shall presently\r\nexplain, by a greatly increased temperature. The effect of this\r\nwas, to weaken and gradually destroy the vessels, especially those\r\nwhich, like the steam vessels V and V′ (_fig._ 12.), were\r\nalternately heated and cooled.\r\n\r\nBesides these defects, the power of Savery's engines was [Pg073]\r\nalso very restricted, both as to the quantity of water raised and as\r\nto the height to which it was elevated. On the other hand, the\r\natmospheric engine was limited in its power only by the dimensions\r\nof its piston. Another considerable advantage which the atmospheric\r\nengine possessed over that of Savery, was the facility with which it\r\nwas capable of driving machinery by means of the working-beam. The\r\nmerit, however, of Newcomen's engine, regarded as an invention, and\r\napart from merely practical considerations, must be ascribed\r\nprincipally to its mechanism and combinations. We find in it no new\r\nprinciple, and scarcely even a novel application of a principle. The\r\nagency of the atmospheric pressure acting against a vacuum, or\r\npartial vacuum, had been long known: the method of producing a\r\nvacuum by the condensation of steam had been suggested by Papin, and\r\ncarried into practical effect by Savery. The mechanical power\r\nobtained from the direct pressure of the elastic force of steam,\r\nused in the atmospheric engine to balance the atmosphere during the\r\nascent of the piston, was suggested by De Caus and Lord Worcester.\r\nThe boiler, gauge pipes, and the regulator, were all borrowed from\r\nthe engine of Savery. The idea of using the atmospheric pressure\r\nagainst a vacuum or partial vacuum, to work a piston in a cylinder,\r\nhad been suggested by Otto Guericke, an ingenious German\r\nphilosopher, who invented the air-pump; and this, combined with the\r\nproduction of a vacuum by the condensation of steam, was\r\nsubsequently suggested by Papin. The use of a working-beam could not\r\nhave been unknown. Nevertheless, the judicious combination of these\r\nscattered principles must be acknowledged to deserve considerable\r\ncredit. In fact, the mechanism contrived by Newcomen rendered a\r\nmachine which was before altogether inefficient, highly efficient:\r\nand, as observed by Tredgold, such a result, considered in a\r\npractical sense, should be more highly valued than the fortuitous\r\ndiscovery of a physical principle. The method of condensing the\r\nsteam by the sudden injection of water, and of expelling the air and\r\nwater from the cylinder by the injection of steam, are two\r\ncontrivances not before in use, which are quite essential to the\r\n[Pg074] effective operation of the engine. These processes, which\r\nare still necessary to the operation of the improved steam engine,\r\nappear to be wholly due to the inventors of the atmospheric engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATMOSPHERIC ENGINE.]\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [9] This pipe is represented as proceeding from the force-pipe\r\n  above the cistern C, in the perspective view of Savery's\r\n  engine at the head of this chapter.\r\n\r\n  [10] Hot water being lighter than cold, floats on the surface.\r\n\r\n  [11] \"Captain\" is a title given in Cornwall to the\r\n  superintendent of the works connected with a mine.\r\n\r\n  [12] As the calculation of the power of an engine depends on\r\n  the number of square inches in the section of the piston, it\r\n  may be useful to give a rule for computing the number of\r\n  square inches in a circle.

BLACK\r\n    OF THE THEORY OF LATENT HEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n(44.) The atmospheric engine was brought to a state of\r\nconsiderable efficiency and improvement by Mr. Beighton, in 1718.\r\nFrom that time it continued in use without any change in its\r\n[Pg076] principle, and with little improvement in its structure,\r\nfor half a century. Although engines of this kind continued to be\r\nextensively constructed, they were usually executed by ordinary\r\nmechanics, incapable of applying to them the just principles of\r\npractical science; and, consequently, little attention was paid to\r\ntheir proportions. It was not until about the year 1772, that Mr.\r\nJohn Smeaton, the celebrated engineer, applied the powers of his\r\nmind to the investigation of this machine, as he had previously\r\ndone with such success to wind and water mills. Although he did\r\nnot introduce any new principle into the atmospheric engine, yet\r\nit derived greatly augmented power from the proportions which he\r\nestablished for engines of different magnitudes.\r\n\r\nIn 1759, Mr. James Brindley, whose name is so celebrated as the\r\nengineer of the Duke of Bridgewater's canal, obtained a patent for\r\nsome improvements in the atmospheric engine. He proposed that the\r\nboiler should be made of wood and stone, with a stove or\r\nfire-place of cast iron within it, so that the fire should be\r\nsurrounded on every side by water. The chimney was to be an iron\r\npipe or tube, conducted through the boiler; so that the heated\r\nair, in passing from the fire, should impart a portion of its heat\r\nto the water. He also proposed a method of feeding the boiler,\r\nwhich, by self-acting machinery, would keep the water in the\r\nboiler at a fixed level, independently of any attention on the\r\npart of the engine-man. This was to be accomplished by a buoy or\r\nfloat upon the surface of the water in the boiler, which should\r\ncommunicate with a valve in the feed-pipe, so that when the level\r\nof the water in the boiler fell, the float or buoy, falling with\r\nit, would open the valve and supply the feed. It is stated, in the\r\n_Biographia Britannica_, that Mr. Brindley, in 1756, undertook to\r\nerect an engine at Newcastle-under-Lyne; but he is said to have\r\nbeen discouraged by the obstacles which were thrown in his way,\r\nand to have abandoned the steam engine.\r\n\r\nThe interval between the invention of the atmospheric engine, and\r\nthe amelioration it received at the hands of Smeaton, has been\r\nrendered memorable by the advent of one who was destined to work a\r\nmighty change in the condition [Pg077] of the human race by the\r\napplication of his vast genius to the adaptation of steam power to\r\nthe uses of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n(45.) JAMES WATT was born at Greenock, in Scotland, on the\r\nnineteenth day of January, in the year 1736.[16]\r\n\r\nThe great-grandfather of Watt, a farmer in Aberdeenshire, was killed\r\nin one of the battles of Montrose. The victorious party, not\r\nthinking death a sufficient expiation for the political opinions in\r\nsupport of which he had fought and bled, punished him in the person\r\nof his son, by confiscating his little property. Thomas Watt, the\r\nson, thus deprived of support, was received by distant relations,\r\nand, for a time, applied himself to study, by which he was enabled,\r\nafter the restoration of tranquillity, to establish himself at\r\nGreenock as a teacher of practical mathematics and navigation. He\r\nresided in the burgh or barony of Crawford's Dyke, and attained a\r\nposition of sufficient respectability to be elected to the office of\r\nbaron-baillie, or chief magistrate, and died in 1734, at the\r\nadvanced age of ninety-two years.\r\n\r\nThomas Watt had two sons. The elder, John, adopted the profession\r\nof his father, and was a teacher of mathematics and navigation at\r\nGlasgow: he died in 1737, at the age of fifty years. The second\r\nson, James, the father of the celebrated engineer, was, during a\r\nquarter of a century, treasurer of the town council of Greenock,\r\nand a local magistrate. He was remarked for the ardent zeal and\r\nenlightened spirit with which he discharged his public duties. His\r\nbusiness was that of a ship-chandler, builder, and general\r\nmerchant; but, unhappily, notwithstanding his active industry, he\r\nlost, in the decline of his life, by unsuccessful commercial\r\nspeculations, a part of the property which he had so honourably\r\nacquired. He died in 1782, at the age of eighty-four years.\r\n\r\nJAMES WATT, to whom the world is so largely indebted for the\r\nextension and improvement of steam power, had from his birth an\r\nextremely delicate constitution. From his mother, [Pg078] whose\r\nfamily name was Muirhead, he received his first lessons in\r\nreading, and he learned from his father writing and arithmetic.\r\nAlthough he was entered as a pupil in the grammar school of\r\nGreenock, yet such was his delicate state of health, that his\r\nattendance there was so interrupted by constant indisposition that\r\nhe could derive but little benefit from the opportunities of\r\ninstruction which it afforded. For a great period of the year he\r\nwas confined to his room, where he devoted himself to study\r\nwithout the aid of instruction. It was in the retirement of the\r\nsick chamber that the high intellectual faculties of Watt, which\r\nwere destined to produce such precious fruits, began to unfold\r\nthemselves. He was too sickly to be subjected to the restraints\r\nwhich the business of education usually imposes on children. His\r\nparents, therefore, found it necessary to leave him at liberty to\r\nchoose his occupations and amusements. The following anecdotes\r\nwill show the use he made of this freedom.\r\n\r\nA friend of his father found the boy one day stretched upon the\r\nhearth tracing with chalk various lines and angles. \"Why do you\r\npermit this child,\" said he, \"to waste his time so; why not send\r\nhim to school?\" Mr. Watt replied, \"You judge him hastily; before\r\nyou condemn us, ascertain how he is employed.\" On examining the\r\nboy, then six years of age, it was found that he was engaged in\r\nthe solution of a problem of Euclid!\r\n\r\nHaving observed the tendency of his son's mind, Mr. Watt placed at\r\nhis disposal a collection of tools. These he soon learned to use\r\nwith the greatest skill. He took to pieces and put together, again\r\nand again, all the children's toys which he could procure; and he\r\nwas constantly employed in making new ones. Subsequently he used\r\nhis tools in constructing a little electrical machine, the sparks\r\nproceeding from which became a great subject of amusement to all\r\nthe playfellows of the poor invalid.\r\n\r\nThough endowed with great retentive powers, Watt would probably\r\nnever have figured among the prodigies of a common school: he would\r\nhave been slow to commit his lessons to memory, from the repugnance\r\nwhich he would feel to repeat like a parrot anything which he did\r\nnot perfectly [Pg079] understand. The natural tendency of his mind\r\nto meditate on whatever came before it, would give him, to\r\nsuperficial observers, the appearance of dullness. Happily, however,\r\nhe had a parent who was sufficiently clear-sighted, and who\r\nentertained high hopes of the growing faculties of his son. More\r\ndistant and less sagacious relations were not so sanguine. One day\r\nMrs. Muirhead, the aunt of the boy, reproaching him for what she\r\nconceived to be listless idleness, desired him to take a book and\r\noccupy himself usefully. \"More than an hour has now passed away,\"\r\nsaid she, \"and you have not uttered a single word. Do you know what\r\nyou have been doing all this time? You have taken off, and put on,\r\nrepeatedly, the lid of the tea-pot; you have been holding the\r\nsaucers and the spoons over the steam, and you have been\r\nendeavouring to catch the drops of water formed on them by the\r\nvapour. Is it not a shame for you to waste your time so?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Muirhead was little aware that this was the first experiment\r\nin the splendid career of discovery which was subsequently to\r\nimmortalise her little nephew. She did not see, as we now can, in\r\nthe little boy playing with the tea-pot, the great engineer\r\npreluding to those discoveries which were destined to confer on\r\nmankind benefits so inestimable.\r\n\r\nOne of the social qualities of mind which was remarkable\r\nthroughout his life, was the singular felicity and grace with\r\nwhich he related anecdotes. This power was manifested even in his\r\nearliest childhood. The following is an extract from a letter\r\nwritten by Mrs. Marion Campbell, his cousin, and the playfellow of\r\nhis childhood:—\r\n\r\n\"He was not fourteen when his mother brought him to Glasgow to\r\nvisit a friend of hers; his brother John accompanied him. On Mrs.\r\nWatt's return to Glasgow, some weeks after, her friend said, 'You\r\nmust take your son James home; I cannot stand the degree of\r\nexcitement he keeps me in; I am worn out for want of sleep. Every\r\nevening before ten o'clock, our usual hour of retiring to rest, he\r\ncontrives to engage me in conversation, then begins some striking\r\ntale, and, whether humorous or pathetic, the interest is so\r\noverpowering that the family all listen to him with breathless\r\nattention, and hour after hour strikes unheeded.'\" [Pg080]\r\n\r\nWatt had a younger brother, John, who was subsequently lost by\r\nshipwreck, in a voyage from Scotland to the United States. This lad,\r\nhaving determined on following the business of his father, left James\r\nmore completely at liberty to choose his own occupation. But such a\r\nchoice was difficult for a student who commanded equal success in\r\nevery thing to which he directed his attention.\r\n\r\nThe excursions which he was in the habit of making on the Scottish\r\nmountains surrounding Loch Lomond, naturally directed his\r\nattention to botany and mineralogy, in each of which he attained\r\nconsiderable knowledge. His love of anecdote and romance was\r\nlikewise gratified by the scenery which he enjoyed in these walks;\r\nand the traditions and popular songs with which they made him\r\nacquainted. When from ill-health, as constantly happened, he was\r\nconfined to the house, he devoted himself to chemistry, natural\r\nphilosophy, and even to medicine and surgery. In chemistry he\r\nacquired some experimental skill, and studied with eager zeal the\r\nelements of natural philosophy by S'. Gravesande. His own unhappy\r\nmaladies prompted him to read works on surgery and medicine; and\r\nto such an extent did the activity of his mind impel him on these\r\nsubjects, that he was found one day dissecting, in his room, the\r\nhead of a child, who had died of some unknown disease, with a view\r\nto ascertain the cause of its death.\r\n\r\nIn 1775, at the age of nineteen, at the recommendation of Dr.\r\nDick, professor of natural philosophy in the university of\r\nGlasgow, he went to London, where he employed himself in the house\r\nof Mr. John Morgan, a mathematical instrument maker, in Finch\r\nLane, Cornhill, to whom he apprenticed himself for three years. He\r\nremained, however, only a year, at the expiration of which\r\n(probably owing to his delicate state of health) he was released\r\nfrom his apprenticeship, and returned to Glasgow, with the\r\nintention of establishing himself in business as an optician and\r\nmathematical instrument maker. In the fulfilment of this\r\nintention, however, he was obstructed by the interposition of the\r\nCorporation of Trades in that town, who regarded him as an\r\nintruder, not qualified by the necessary apprenticeship to carry\r\non business. All means of conciliation being [Pg081] exhausted,\r\nthe Professors of the University interfered, and gave him the use\r\nof three apartments within the college, for carrying on his\r\nbusiness, and likewise appointed him mathematical instrument maker\r\nto the University. Soon afterwards the opposition of the local\r\ntrades seems to have given way, and he opened a shop in Glasgow\r\nfor the sale of mathematical instruments.\r\n\r\nAfter the celebrity at which he has arrived, it will be easily\r\nbelieved that every trace of his earlier connection with Glasgow\r\ncollege is carefully cherished. There are accordingly preserved at\r\nthat place little instruments and pieces of apparatus of exquisite\r\nworkmanship, which were executed entirely by the hand of Watt, at\r\na time when he was not in a condition to command the aid of\r\nworkmen under him.\r\n\r\nAt the time of obtaining this appointment in the University, Watt\r\nwas in his twenty-first year. His natural talents and winning\r\nmanners were speedily the means of gaining for him the esteem and\r\nfriendship of all those eminent persons connected at the time with\r\nthat university whose regard was most valued. Among these the\r\nearliest of his friends and patrons were—ADAM SMITH, the author of\r\n\"The Wealth of Nations;\" BLACK, afterwards celebrated for his\r\nchemical discoveries, and more especially for his theory of latent\r\nheat; and ROBERT SIMSON, rendered illustrious by his works on\r\nancient geometry. In releasing Watt from the persecution of the\r\nGlasgow corporation, these distinguished persons first imagined that\r\nthey were conferring a benefit merely on an industrious and clever\r\nartisan, whose engaging manners won their regard; but a short\r\nacquaintance with him was sufficient to convince them how superior\r\nhis mind was to his position, and they conceived towards him the\r\nmost lively friendship. His shop became the common rendezvous, the\r\nafternoon lounge, of all who were most distinguished for literary\r\nand scientific attainments among the professors and students. There\r\nthey met to discuss the topics of the day in art, science, and\r\nliterature. Among these students, the name which afterwards attained\r\nthe highest distinctions, and among these distinctions, not the\r\nleast, the lasting personal friendship and esteem of Watt himself,\r\nwas ROBISON, [Pg082] the author of a well known work on Mechanics,\r\nand one of the contributors to the _Encyclopœdia Britannica_.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from an unpublished manuscript by Robison\r\nhimself will show at once the estimation in which Watt was held,\r\nand will illustrate one of the most interesting traits of his\r\npersonal character:—\r\n\r\n\"I had always, from my earliest youth, a great relish for the\r\nnatural sciences, and particularly for mathematical and mechanical\r\nphilosophy, when I was introduced by Drs. Simson, Dick, and Moor,\r\ngentlemen eminent for their mathematical abilities, to Mr. Watt. I\r\nsaw a workman, and expected no more; but was surprised to find a\r\nphilosopher as young as myself, and always ready to instruct me. I\r\nhad the vanity to think myself a pretty good proficient in my\r\nfavourite study, and was rather mortified at finding Mr. Watt so\r\nmuch my superior. . . . Whenever any puzzle came in the way of any\r\nof the young students, we went to Mr. Watt. He needed only to be\r\nprompted, for every thing became to him the beginning of a new and\r\nserious study, and we knew that he would not quit it till he had\r\neither discovered its insignificancy, or had made something of it.\r\nHe learnt the German language in order to peruse Leupold's\r\n'Theatrum Machinarum;' so did I, to know what he was about.\r\nSimilar reasons made us both learn the Italian language.  *  *  *\r\nWhen to his superiority of knowledge is added the _naïve_\r\nsimplicity and candour of Mr. Watt's character, it is no wonder\r\nthat the attachment of his acquaintances was strong. I have seen\r\nsomething of the world, and am obliged to say I never saw such\r\nanother instance of general and cordial attachment to a person\r\nwhom all acknowledged to be their superior. But that superiority\r\nwas concealed under the most amiable candour, and a liberal\r\nallowance of merit to every man. Mr. Watt was the first to ascribe\r\nto the ingenuity of a friend things which were nothing but his own\r\nsurmises, followed out and embodied by another. I am the more\r\nentitled to say this, as I have often experienced it in my own\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nWatt never permitted the inquiries which arose out of these\r\nreunions to interfere with the discharge of the duties of his\r\nworkshop. There he passed the day, devoting the [Pg083] night to\r\nstudy. Every inquiry appeared to him to be attractive in\r\nproportion to its difficulty, and to have charms in proportion as\r\nit was removed from the common routine of his business. As an\r\nexample of this may be mentioned the fact, that, being himself so\r\ninsensible to the charms of music that he could not distinguish\r\none note from another, he was actually induced to undertake the\r\nconstruction of an organ, in which he was nevertheless completely\r\nsuccessful. The instrument he constructed, as might have been\r\nexpected, contained many improvements in its mechanism; but what\r\nis much more remarkable, its tone and its musical qualities\r\ncommanded the admiration of all the professional musicians who\r\nheard it. In the construction of this instrument Watt showed that\r\nvigorous spirit of investigation which characterised all the\r\nsubsequent labours of his life. He made out the scale of\r\ntemperament by the aid of the phenomena of beats, of which he\r\ncould only obtain a knowledge by a profound but obscure work\r\npublished by Dr. Robert Smith of Cambridge.\r\n\r\nThe earliest occasion on which the attention of Watt is said to\r\nhave been called to the agency of steam, was in the year 1759,\r\nwhen his friend Robison entertained some speculations for applying\r\nthat agent as a means of propelling wheel carriages; and he\r\nconsulted Watt on the subject. No record, however, has been\r\npreserved of any experiments which were tried on this occasion;\r\nnor does it appear that the inquiry was carried farther than a\r\nverbal discussion, such as habitually took place on other subjects\r\nof science between Watt and his friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n(46.) In 1762, Watt tried some experiments on the force of steam\r\nat a high pressure, confined in a close digester; and he then\r\nconstructed a small model to show how motion could be obtained\r\nfrom that power. The practicability of what has since been called\r\nthe _High Pressure Engine_, was demonstrated by him on this\r\noccasion; but he did not pursue the inquiry, on account of the\r\nsupposed danger of working with such compressed steam as was\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to provide, in the cabinets of experimental apparatus\r\nfor the instruction of the students of universities, [Pg084]\r\nsmall working models of the most useful machines. In the\r\ncollection for the illustration of the lectures delivered to the\r\nNatural Philosophy class in the University of Glasgow was a\r\nworking model of Newcomen's atmospheric engine, applied to a pump\r\nfor raising water; which, however, had never been found to work\r\nsatisfactorily. The Professor of Experimental Philosophy of that\r\nday, Dr. John Anderson (the founder of the celebrated Andersonian\r\nInstitution), sent this model in 1763 to Watt's workshop, to be\r\nrepaired. Its defects soon disappeared, and it was made to work to\r\nthe satisfaction of the professor and students.\r\n\r\nThis simple discharge of his duty, however, did not satisfy the\r\nartisan; and his wonted activity of mind rendered this model a\r\nsubject of profound meditation, and led him into a course of\r\npractical inquiry respecting it, which formed the commencement of a\r\nmost brilliant career of mechanical discovery. The improvement—we\r\nmight almost say the creation—of the steam engine, by this great\r\nman, must not therefore be regarded, as so often happens with\r\nmechanical discoveries, as the result of fortuitous observation, or\r\neven of a felicitous momentary inspiration. Watt, on the other hand,\r\nconducted his investigation by a course of deep thought, and of\r\nexperiments marked by the last refinement of delicacy and address.\r\nIf he had received a more extended and liberal education, one would\r\nhave thought that he had adopted for his guide the celebrated maxim\r\nof Bacon:—\r\n\r\n\"To write, speak, meditate, or act, when we are not provided with\r\n_facts_ to direct our thoughts, is to navigate a coast full of\r\ndangers without a pilot, and to launch into the immensity of the\r\nocean without either rudder or compass.\"\r\n\r\nThe model which he had repaired, had a cylinder of only two inches\r\ndiameter, and six inches stroke. After he had put it in complete\r\norder, he found, that although the boiler was much larger in\r\nproportion to the cylinder than those of real engines, yet, that\r\nit was incapable of supplying the cylinder with steam in\r\nsufficient quantity to keep it at work. To enable it to continue\r\nto move, he found it necessary to lessen the quantity of water\r\nraised by its pump, so as to [Pg085] reduce the load on its\r\npiston very much below the proper standard according to the common\r\nrules for large engines.\r\n\r\nHe ascribed the great inferiority in the performance of the model,\r\ncompared with the performance of the large engines, to the small\r\nsize of the cylinder, and to its material. The cylinder of the\r\nmodel was brass, while those of large engines were of cast iron;\r\nand brass being a better conductor of heat than iron, he concluded\r\nthat more heat in proportion was lost from this cause in the\r\nmodel, than in the larger engines. He observed that the small\r\ncylinder was so heated when the steam was admitted into it, that\r\nit could not be touched by the hand; but, nevertheless, that this\r\nheat contributed nothing to its performance, inasmuch as before\r\nthe piston descended, the cylinder required to be cooled.\r\n\r\n\r\n(47.) His first attempt to improve the engine, was by using a\r\nwooden cylinder instead of an iron one. He accordingly made a\r\nmodel with a cylinder of wood, soaked in linseed oil, and baked to\r\ndryness. With this he made numerous experiments, and found that it\r\nrequired a less quantity of water to be thrown into the cylinder\r\nto condense the steam, and that it was worked with a less supply\r\nof steam from the boiler than was necessary with the metallic\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\nStill he found that the force with which the piston descended was\r\nconsiderably less than that which the atmospheric pressure ought\r\nto supply, supposing a tolerably perfect vacuum to be produced\r\nunder the piston. This led him to suspect that the water injected\r\ninto the cylinder was not perfectly effectual in condensing the\r\nsteam. The experiments which he had previously made on the\r\nincreased temperature at which water boils under pressures greater\r\nthan that of the atmosphere, led him by analogy to the conclusion\r\nthat it would boil at lower temperatures if it were submitted to a\r\npressure less than the atmosphere, and he was aware that Dr.\r\nCullen and others had then recently discovered that in vacuo,\r\nwater would boil at so low a temperature as 100°. These notions\r\nsuggested the probability that the water injected into the\r\ncylinder being heated by the condensed steam, might produce vapour\r\nof a low temperature [Pg086] and reduced pressure under the\r\npiston, which would account for the deficiency he observed in the\r\npower of the engine.\r\n\r\nNo means occurred to him by which he could ascertain, by direct\r\nexperiment, the temperatures at which water would boil under\r\npressures less than that of the atmosphere. He sought, however, to\r\ndetermine it by the following method. Having ascertained, by\r\nrepeating and multiplying the experiments which he had tried in\r\n1762, on high-pressure steam, he obtained a table of the\r\ntemperatures at which water boils at various pressures greater\r\nthan that of the atmosphere. These results he laid down in a\r\nseries forming a curve, of which the abscissa represented the\r\ntemperatures, and the ordinates the pressures. He then continued\r\nthis curve, backwards as it were, and obtained, by analogy, an\r\napproximation to the boiling temperatures, corresponding to\r\npressures less than that of the atmosphere. In other words, having\r\nobtained by his experiments a notion, however imperfect, of the\r\nlaw or rule observed by the temperatures at which water boils at\r\ndifferent pressures _greater_ than that of the atmosphere, he\r\ncalculated by the same law or rule what the pressures would be at\r\ndifferent pressures _less_ than that of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nApplying these results to the interior of the cylinder of the\r\natmospheric engine, he obtained an approximation to the pressure\r\nof the vapour which would be produced from the warm water formed\r\nby the cold water injected into the cylinder, and the steam\r\ncondensed by it; and he accordingly found that vapour, having a\r\npressure seriously injurious to the power of the engine would be\r\nproduced in the cylinder, unless considerably more water of\r\ninjection was thrown in than was customary.\r\n\r\nIt was apparent that the actual quantity of steam usefully\r\nemployed in the cylinder at each stroke, was only the quantity\r\nwhich filled the cylinder; and therefore, in order to ascertain\r\nthe quantity of steam lost by the imperfections of the machine, it\r\nwas necessary to compare the actual quantity of steam transmitted\r\nby the boiler to the cylinder at each stroke, with the quantity\r\nwhich would just fill the cylinder. The difference would of course\r\nbe wasted. But to determine [Pg087] the actual quantity of steam\r\nsupplied by the boiler to the cylinder, there was no other means\r\nthan by observing the quantity of water evaporated in the boiler.\r\nThat being observed, it was necessary to know the quantity of\r\nsteam which that water formed; and it was therefore necessary to\r\ndetermine the quantity or volume of steam which a given volume of\r\nwater produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n(48.) On considering more attentively the operation of the\r\nmachine, the following circumstances gradually unfolded themselves\r\nto him.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the piston at the top of the cylinder, and the\r\nspace in the cylinder below it, filled with steam so as to balance\r\nthe pressure of the atmosphere above the piston. Under such\r\ncircumstances the steam, as will presently be explained, must have\r\nthe temperature of boiling water. But that the steam should have,\r\nand should maintain, this temperature, it was evidently necessary\r\nthat the inner surface of the cylinder in contact with it should\r\nhave the same temperature: for if it had a lower temperature, it\r\nwould take heat from the steam, and reduce the temperature of the\r\nlatter. Now the cylinder being a mass of metal, has a quality in\r\nvirtue of which heat passes freely through its dimensions, so that\r\nits inner surface could not be maintained at a temperature more\r\nelevated than that of its dimensions extending from the inner\r\nsurface to the outer surface. Therefore, to maintain the steam\r\ncontained in the cylinder at the proper temperature, it was\r\nessential that the whole of the solid metal composing the cylinder\r\nshould be itself at that temperature.\r\n\r\nThings being in this state, it was required that a vacuum should\r\nbe produced under the piston to give effect to the atmospheric\r\npressure above it, by relieving it from the pressure below. This,\r\nindeed, would appear to have been attained by introducing as much\r\ncold water within the cylinder as would be sufficient to reconvert\r\nthe steam contained in it into water; but Watt found, in his\r\nexperiments on the atmospheric model, that the piston would not\r\ndescend with the proper force, unless a vastly greater quantity of\r\nwater were introduced into the cylinder than the quantity which he\r\nhad ascertained to be [Pg088] necessary for the reconversion of\r\nthe steam into water. The cause of this he perceived and fully\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose as much, and no more, cold water introduced into the\r\ncylinder as would reconvert the steam contained in it into water,\r\nthen we should have in the bottom of the cylinder a quantity of\r\nwarm water with a vacuum above it: but the entire mass of metal\r\ncomposing the cylinder itself, which was previously at the\r\ntemperature of boiling water, would still be at the same\r\ntemperature. The warm water, resting in contact with this metal in\r\nthe bottom of the cylinder, would be immediately heated by it, and\r\nwould rise in its temperature, while the metal of the cylinder\r\nitself would be somewhat lowered in temperature by the heat which\r\nit would thus impart to the warm water contained in it. Under\r\nthese circumstances, as we shall presently explain, steam would be\r\nproduced from the water, which would fill the cylinder; and\r\nalthough such steam would not have a mechanical pressure equal in\r\namount to the atmosphere, and therefore would not altogether\r\nprevent the piston from descending if it had no load to move, yet\r\nit would deprive the engine of so great a portion of its\r\nlegitimate power as to render it altogether inefficient. But this\r\ndefect would be removed by throwing into the cylinder a sufficient\r\nquantity of cold water, not only to destroy the steam contained in\r\nit, but also to cool the entire mass of metal composing the\r\ncylinder itself, until it would be reduced to such a temperature\r\nthat the vapour proceeding from the water contained in it would\r\nhave so small a pressure that it would not seriously or\r\ninjuriously obstruct the descent of the piston.\r\n\r\nThe piston being made to descend with such force as to render the\r\nmachine practically efficient, it would then be necessary again to\r\nmake it ascend; and to accomplish this, Watt found that the boiler\r\nshould supply a quantity of steam many times greater than was\r\nnecessary to fill the cylinder. Mature reflection on the\r\ncircumstances which have been just explained, enabled him to\r\ndiscover how this undue quantity of steam was rendered necessary.\r\n\r\nLet it be recollected, that when the piston has reached the bottom\r\nof the cylinder, the whole mass of the cylinder, and [Pg089] the\r\npiston itself, are reduced to so low a temperature that the vapour\r\nof water, having the same temperature, has no pressure sufficiently\r\ngreat to obstruct the action of the machine. When, in order to make\r\nthe piston ascend, steam is introduced from the boiler into the\r\ncylinder under the piston, this steam encounters, in the first\r\ninstance, the cold surfaces of the metal forming the bottom of the\r\ncylinder and the bottom of the piston. The first effect of this is\r\nto convert the steam which comes from the boiler into water, an\r\neffect which is produced by that steam imparting its heat to the\r\nmetal with which it comes into contact. This destruction of steam\r\ncontinues until the metal exposed to contact with it has been heated\r\nup to the temperature of boiling water. Then, and not till then, the\r\nsteam below the piston will have a pressure equal to that of the\r\natmosphere above it, and the piston will begin to ascend. As it\r\nascends, however, the sides of the cylinder which it exposes to the\r\ncontact of the steam are cold, and partially destroy the steam.\r\nSteam, therefore, must be supplied from the boiler to replace the\r\nsteam thus destroyed; nor can the piston reach the top of the\r\ncylinder until such a quantity of steam shall have flowed from the\r\nboiler into the cylinder, as shall be sufficient not only to fill\r\nthe cylinder under the piston, but likewise, by its condensation, to\r\nraise the whole mass of the cylinder and piston to the temperature\r\nof boiling water.\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances which forced themselves upon the\r\nattention of Watt, in the course of repairing, and subsequently\r\ntrying, the model of the atmospheric engine, at Glasgow. Being\r\ninformed generally of the uses of the engine in the drainage of\r\nmines, and of the vast expense attending its operation, by reason\r\nof the quantity of fuel which it consumed, he saw how important\r\nany improvement would be by which the extensive sources of waste\r\nwhich had thus presented themselves could be removed. He saw also,\r\nthat all that portion of steam which was expended, not in filling\r\nthe cylinder under the piston, but in heating the great mass of\r\nmetal composing the cylinder and piston, from a low temperature to\r\nthat of boiling water, upon each stroke of the piston, was so much\r\nheat lost, and that the proportion of the fuel expended in\r\nevaporating the steam thus wasted would be saved, if by any\r\n[Pg090] expedient _he could make the piston descend without\r\ncooling the cylinder_. But in order to estimate the full amount of\r\nthis waste, and to discover the most effectual means of preventing\r\nit, it was necessary to investigate the quantity of heat necessary\r\nfor the evaporation of a given quantity of water; also, the\r\nquantity of steam which a given quantity of water would produce,\r\nas well as other circumstances connected with the temperature and\r\npressure of steam. He, therefore, applied himself to make\r\nexperiments with a view to elucidate these questions; and\r\nsucceeded in obtaining results which led to the discovery of some\r\nof the most important of those physical phenomena, on the due\r\napplication of which, the efficacy of the steam engine, which he\r\nafterwards invented, depended, and which also form striking facts\r\nin the general physics of heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n(49.) The first question to which he directed his experiments, was\r\nthe determination of the extent to which water enlarged its\r\nvolume, or magnitude, when it passed into steam. To ascertain\r\nthis, he filled a thin Florence flask with steam, of a pressure\r\nequal to the atmosphere, and weighed it accurately. The same flask\r\nwas then filled with water, and weighed again. Finally, the weight\r\nof the flask itself was ascertained. It is evident, that by such\r\nmeans, the exact weight of the steam which filled the flask, and\r\nof the same bulk of water, would be obtained. He found that the\r\nwater weighed about eighteen hundred times more than the steam;\r\nfrom whence he inferred that the steam which filled the flask\r\ncontained about eighteen hundred times less water than the flask\r\nwould contain.[17]\r\n\r\n[Pg091] Having once ascertained this point, he was able, by\r\nobserving the quantity of water evaporated in the boiler of the\r\natmospheric model, to compute the volume of steam which was\r\nsupplied to the cylinder. It was evident, that for every cubic\r\ninch of water evaporated in the boiler, eighteen hundred cubic\r\ninches of steam were supplied to the cylinder. Having accurately\r\nobserved the evaporation of the boiler for a short time, and the\r\nnumber of strokes made by the piston in the same time, he found\r\nthat the quantity of water evaporated in the boiler would supply\r\nabout four times as much steam as the cylinder would require. He\r\nconsequently inferred, that about three-fourths of the steam\r\nproduced was wasted.\r\n\r\nThe next question to which he directed his experiments, was to\r\nascertain the quantity of cold water necessary to be injected into\r\nthe cylinder, in order to condense the steam contained in it. To\r\nascertain this, he attached a pipe to a boiler, by which he was\r\nenabled to conduct the steam from the boiler into a glass jar\r\ncontaining cold water at fifty-two degrees of temperature. The\r\nsteam, as it passed from the boiler through the pipe, was\r\ncondensed by the cold water, and continued to be so condensed,\r\nuntil, by the heat which it imparted to the water, the latter\r\nbegan to boil, and would then condense no more steam. On comparing\r\nthe water in the glass jar, when boiling, with the water\r\noriginally contained in it at fifty-two [Pg092] degrees, the\r\nquantity was found to be increased in the proportion of six to\r\nseven, very nearly; from which he inferred, that to reduce one\r\nounce of steam to water, it was necessary to mix about six ounces\r\nof cold water with it.\r\n\r\nHe was further led to the conclusion, that steam contains a vast\r\nquantity of heat, by the following experiment. He heated, in a\r\nclose digester, a quantity of water several degrees above the\r\ncommon boiling point. When thus heated, by opening a stop-cock, he\r\nallowed the compressed steam to escape into a cold vessel; in\r\nthree or four seconds, he found that the heat of the water in the\r\ndigester was reduced from a very high temperature to the common\r\nboiling point; yet, that all the steam which escaped from it, and\r\nwhich carried off with it the superabundant heat, formed only a\r\nfew drops of water when condensed; from which he inferred, that\r\nthis small quantity of water, in the form of steam, contained as\r\nmuch heat as was sufficient to raise all the water in the digester\r\nfrom the boiling point to the temperature at which it was before\r\nthe steam was allowed to escape.\r\n\r\nHaving thus ascertained the exact quantity of cold water which\r\nought to be injected into the cylinder in order to condense the\r\nsteam which filled the cylinder, he found, on comparing the\r\nquantity necessary to be injected in order to enable the piston to\r\ndescend, that this quantity was about four times as great as that\r\nwhich was necessary to condense the steam. This led him to the\r\nconclusion, that about four times as much heat was destroyed in\r\nthe cylinder as needed to be destroyed, if the object were the\r\nmere condensation of the steam. This result fully corroborated the\r\nother conclusion, deduced, from the proportion which he found\r\nbetween the quantity of steam supplied by the boiler and the\r\nactual contents of the cylinder.\r\n\r\n\r\n(50.) Watt was forcibly struck with these circumstances, not only\r\non account of their importance in an economical point of view,\r\nwhen their relation to steam power was considered, but still more\r\nso, as indicating phenomena in the physics of heat altogether\r\nnovel to him.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, eagerly sought his friend Dr. Black, to whom he\r\ncommunicated these results. Then, for the first time, he [Pg093]\r\nwas informed, by Black, of the theory of LATENT HEAT, which had\r\nrecently been discovered by him, and of which these very phenomena\r\nformed the basis.\r\n\r\nSome passages in the works of Dr. Robison produced an erroneous\r\nimpression, that a large share of the merit of the discoveries of\r\nWatt which have been just explained was due to Dr. Black, to whose\r\ninstructions on the subject of latent heat Watt was represented to\r\nhave owed the knowledge of those facts which led to his principal\r\ninventions and improvements. We shall here give, in the words of\r\nWatt himself, his explanation of the circumstances which led to\r\nthis error. This explanation is given in a letter addressed by\r\nWatt to Dr. Brewster, in May 1814, and prefixed to the third\r\nvolume of Brewster's edition of Robison's Mechanical Philosophy:—\r\n\r\n  \"The representations of friends whose opinions I highly value\r\n  induce me to avail myself of this opportunity of noticing an error\r\n  into which not only Dr. Robison, but apparently also Dr. Black,\r\n  has fallen, in relation to the _origin_ of my improvements upon\r\n  the steam engine, and which not having been publicly controverted\r\n  by me, has, I am informed, been adopted by almost every subsequent\r\n  writer upon the subject of latent heat.\r\n\r\n  \"Dr. Robison, in the article Steam Engine, after passing an\r\n  encomium upon me, dictated by the partiality of friendship,\r\n  qualifies me as the '_pupil_ and intimate friend of Dr. Black,'—a\r\n  description which not being there accompanied with any inference,\r\n  did not particularly strike me at the time of its first perusal.\r\n  He afterwards, in the dedication to me of his edition of Dr.\r\n  Black's lectures upon chemistry, goes the length of supposing me\r\n  to have professed to owe my improvements upon the steam engine to\r\n  the instructions and information I had received from that\r\n  gentleman, which certainly was a misapprehension; as, though I\r\n  have always felt and acknowledged my obligations to him for the\r\n  information I had received from his conversation, and particularly\r\n  for the knowledge of the doctrine of latent heat, I never did nor\r\n  _could_ consider my improvements as originating in those\r\n  communications. He is also mistaken in his assertion (p. 8. of the\r\n  preface to the above work), that 'I had attended two courses\r\n  [Pg094] of the doctor's lectures;' for, unfortunately for me, the\r\n  necessary avocations of my business prevented me from attending\r\n  his or any other lectures at college; and as Dr. Robison was\r\n  himself absent from Scotland for four years at the period referred\r\n  to, he must have been misled by erroneous information. In p. 184.\r\n  of the lectures, Dr. Black says, 'I have the pleasure of thinking\r\n  that the knowledge we have acquired concerning the nature of\r\n  elastic vapours, in consequence of my fortunate observation of\r\n  what happens in its formation and condensation, has contributed in\r\n  no inconsiderable degree to the public good by _suggesting_ to my\r\n  friend Mr. Watt of Birmingham, then of Glasgow, his improvement on\r\n  this useful engine' (meaning the steam engine of which he is then\r\n  speaking). There can be no doubt from what follows in his\r\n  description of the engine, and from the very honourable mention\r\n  which he has made of me in various parts of his lectures, that he\r\n  did not mean to lessen any merit that might attach to me as an\r\n  inventor; but, on the contrary, he was always disposed to give me\r\n  fully as much praise as I deserved.\r\n\r\n  \"And were that otherwise doubtful, it would, I think, be evident\r\n  from the following quotation from a letter of his to me, dated\r\n  13th February 1783, where, speaking of an intended publication by\r\n  a friend of mine, on subjects connected with the history of steam,\r\n  he says, 'I think it is very proper for you to give him a short\r\n  account of your discoveries and speculations; _and particularly_\r\n  _to assert clearly and fully your sole right to the honour of_\r\n  _the improvements of the steam engine_.' And in a written\r\n  testimonial which he very kindly gave me, on the occasion of a\r\n  trial at law against a piracy of my invention in 1796-7, after\r\n  giving a short account of the invention, he adds, '_Mr. Watt was_\r\n  _the sole inventor of the capital improvement and contrivance_\r\n  _above mentioned._'\r\n\r\n  \"Under this conviction of his candour and friendship, it is very\r\n  painful to me to controvert any assertion or opinion of my revered\r\n  friend; yet, in the present case I find it necessary to say, that\r\n  he appears to me to have fallen into an error; and I hope, in\r\n  addition to my assertion, to make that appear by the short history\r\n  I have given of my invention, in my [Pg095] notes upon Dr.\r\n  Robison's essay, as well as by the following account of the state\r\n  of my knowledge previous to my receiving any explanation of the\r\n  doctrine of latent heat; and also from that of the facts which\r\n  principally guided me in the invention.\r\n\r\n  \"It was known very long before my time, that steam was condensed\r\n  by coming into contact with cold bodies, and that it communicated\r\n  heat to them; witness the common still, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n  \"It was known, by some experiments of Dr. Cullen and others, that\r\n  water and other liquids boiled in vacuo at very low heats; water\r\n  below 100°.\r\n\r\n  \"It was known to some philosophers that the capacity or\r\n  equilibrium of heat, as we then called it, was much smaller in\r\n  mercury and tin than in water.\r\n\r\n  \"It was also known that evaporation caused the cooling of the\r\n  evaporating liquid, and bodies in contact with it.\r\n\r\n  \"I had myself made experiments to determine the following facts:—\r\n\r\n  \"First, the capacities of heat for iron, copper, and some sorts of\r\n  wood, comparatively with water.\r\n\r\n  \"Second, the bulk of steam compared with that of water.\r\n\r\n  \"Third, the quantity of water evaporated in a certain boiler by a\r\n  pound of coals.\r\n\r\n  \"Fourth, the elasticities of steam at various temperatures greater\r\n  than that of boiling water, and an approximation to the law which\r\n  it followed at other temperatures.\r\n\r\n  \"Fifth, how much water in the form of steam was required every\r\n  stroke by a small Newcomen's engine, with a wooden cylinder six\r\n  inches diameter, and twelve inches stroke.\r\n\r\n  \"Sixth, the quantity of cold water required in every stroke to\r\n  condense the steam in that cylinder, so as to give it a working\r\n  power of about 7 lb. on the inch.\r\n\r\n  \"Here I was at a loss to understand how so much cold water could\r\n  be heated so much by so small a quantity of water in the form of\r\n  steam; and I accordingly applied to Dr. Black, and then first\r\n  understood what was called latent heat.\r\n\r\n  \"But this theory, though useful in determining the quantity of\r\n  injection necessary where the quantity of water [Pg096]\r\n  evaporated by the boiler, and used by the cylinder, was known, and\r\n  in determining, by the quantity and heat of the hot water emitted\r\n  by Newcomen's engines, the quantity of steam required to work them\r\n  did not lead to the improvements I afterwards made in the engine.\r\n  These improvements proceeded upon the old established fact, that\r\n  steam was condensed by the contact of cold bodies; and the later\r\n  known one, that water boiled in vacuo at heats below 100°, and\r\n  consequently that a vacuum could not be obtained unless the\r\n  cylinder and its contents were cooled every stroke to below that\r\n  heat.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCH LOMOND.]\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [16] We are indebted for many of the anecdotes of the life of\r\n  Watt to the _Eloge Historique_, recently published by M. Arago,\r\n  who was furnished with all the documents and circumstances\r\n  relating to this celebrated person which were considered proper\r\n  for publication, by his son, the present James Watt, Esq., of\r\n  Aston Hall, near Birmingham, and to the notes added to this\r\n  memoir by Mr. Muirhead, a relative of Mr. Watt.\r\n\r\n  [17] The following is the account of these experiments given\r\n  in Watt's own words:—\r\n\r\n  \"It being evident that there was a great error in Dr.\r\n  Desagulier's calculations of Mr. Beighton's experiments on the\r\n  bulk of steam, a Florence flask, capable of containing about a\r\n  pound of water, had about one ounce of distilled water put\r\n  into it; a glass tube was fitted into its mouth, and the\r\n  joining made tight by lapping that part of the tube with\r\n  packthread covered with glazier's putty. When the flask was\r\n  set upright, the tube reached down near to the surface of the\r\n  water, and in that position the whole was placed in a tin\r\n  reflecting oven before a fire until the water was wholly\r\n  evaporated, which happened in about an hour, and might have\r\n  been done sooner, had I not wished the heat not much to exceed\r\n  that of boiling water. As the air in the flask was heavier\r\n  than the steam, the latter ascended to the top, and expelled\r\n  the air through the tube. When the water was all evaporated,\r\n  the oven and flask were removed from the fire, and a blast of\r\n  cold air was directed against one side of the flask, to\r\n  collect the condensed steam in one place. When all was cold,\r\n  the tube was removed, the flask and its contents were weighed\r\n  with care; and the flask being made hot, it was dried by\r\n  blowing into it by bellows, and when weighed again was found\r\n  to have lost rather more than four grains, estimated at 4-1/3\r\n  grains. When the flask was filled with water, it was found to\r\n  contain about 17-1/8 ounces avoirdupois of that fluid which\r\n  gave about 1800 for the expansion of water converted into\r\n  steam of the heat of boiling water.\r\n\r\n  \"This experiment was repeated with nearly the same result, and\r\n  in order to ascertain whether the flask had been wholly filled\r\n  with steam, a similar quantity of water was for the third time\r\n  evaporated; and, while the flask was still cold, it was placed\r\n  inverted with its mouth (contracted by the tube) immersed in a\r\n  vessel of water, which it sucked in as it cooled, until in the\r\n  temperature of the atmosphere it was filled to within half an\r\n  ounce measure of water.\r\n\r\n  \"In repetitions of this experiment at a later date, I\r\n  simplified the apparatus by omitting the tube, and laying the\r\n  flask upon its side in the oven, partly closing its mouth by a\r\n  cork, having a notch on one side, and otherwise proceeding as\r\n  has been mentioned.\"\r\n\r\n[Pg097]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLASGOW.]\r\n\r\nCHAP.

We shall pause here to put the reader in possession of the\r\nphysical and mechanical principles connected with the evaporation\r\nof water and other liquids, which are necessary to enable him to\r\nunderstand the full extent of the value and the merit of the\r\ndiscoveries of Watt, and to comprehend the [Pg098] structure and\r\noperation of the steam engine in its improved form, as it has\r\npassed to us from his hands.\r\n\r\nAs we shall frequently have occasion to refer to the indications\r\nof a thermometer, we shall first explain the principle of that\r\ninstrument as it is commonly used in this country.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer is an instrument used for the purpose of measuring\r\nand indicating the temperature or sensible heat of material\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nHeat, like all other physical agents, can only be measured by its\r\neffects. One of these effects best suited for this purpose, is the\r\nchange of dimension which all bodies undergo in consequence of\r\ntheir change of temperature. In general, when heat is applied to a\r\nmaterial substance, that substance undergoes an enlargement of\r\nbulk; and if heat be abstracted from it, it suffers a diminution\r\nof bulk. This variation of magnitude is not always in the same\r\nproportion as the increase or diminution of temperature; but it is\r\nso when applied to certain substances and between certain limits.\r\nOne of the substances whose expansion and contraction through an\r\nextensive range of temperature has been found to be nearly\r\nuniform, and which is attended with other convenient qualities for\r\na thermometer, is the liquid called _mercury_ or _quicksilver_. A\r\nmercurial thermometer is constructed in the following way:—\r\n\r\nA glass tube is made with a small and uniform bore: upon the end\r\nof this tube, a bulb is blown, having a magnitude very great\r\ncompared with the bore of the tube. Let us suppose this bulb and a\r\npart of the tube to be filled with mercury. If the mercury\r\ncontained in the bulb be heated, it will expand, and being more\r\nsusceptible of expansion than the glass which contains it, the\r\nbulb will be too small for its augmented volume: the mercury in\r\nthe bulb can only, therefore, obtain room for its increased bulk\r\nby pressing the mercury in the tube upwards, which it will\r\naccordingly do. The increase of volume which the mercury in the\r\nbulb therefore undergoes, will be exhibited by the increased\r\nlength of the column in the tube. Since the bore of the tube is\r\nmade so exceedingly minute compared with the magnitude of the\r\nbulb, a very small quantity of mercury forced [Pg099] from the\r\nbulb into the tube, will cause a considerable increase of the\r\nlength of the column. Small degrees of expansion will therefore be\r\nrendered very apparent, and may be accurately measured. The\r\nfollowing is the method by which the thermometer called\r\n_Fahrenheit's thermometer_ is graduated.\r\n\r\nThe tube and bulb being prepared and supplied with mercury, as\r\nalready explained, let the instrument be plunged in a vessel of\r\nmelting ice. It will be found that the mercury will stand in the\r\ntube at a certain point, from which it will not vary so long as\r\nany ice remains not completely melted in the vessel. Let a mark be\r\nmade on the tube, or on a scale attached to the tube, at the point\r\ncorresponding to the top of the column: the point thus marked is\r\ncalled the _freezing point_.\r\n\r\nNow let the instrument be immersed in a vessel of boiling water,\r\nthe barometer at the time having the height of thirty inches. It\r\nwill be found that so long as the water is kept boiling, the\r\ncolumn of mercury in the tube will remain stationary. Let the\r\npoint corresponding with the top of the column be marked on the\r\ntube, or on the scale attached to it. This is called the _boiling\r\npoint_. Let the space on the scale between the freezing and\r\nboiling points be now divided into 180 equal parts: each of these\r\nparts is called a _degree_. Let the same divisions be continued\r\nupon the scale below the freezing point, until thirty-two\r\ndivisions be taken; let the lowest division be then marked 0, and\r\nlet the successive divisions upwards from that be numbered 1, 2,\r\n3, &c. In like manner, let the same divisions be continued above\r\nthe boiling point, as far as the tube will admit.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, under these circumstances, the freezing point\r\nwill be marked by 32, and the boiling point by 212. It is usual to\r\nexpress the degrees of a thermometer in the same manner as the\r\ndegrees of a circle, by placing a small ° above the number. Thus\r\nthe freezing point is expressed by 32°, and the boiling point by\r\n212°.\r\n\r\nThe reason the degrees were commenced at 32° below the freezing\r\npoint was, because, when the thermometer was invented, that\r\ntemperature was supposed to be the lowest degree of cold possible,\r\nbeing that of a certain mixture of [Pg100] snow and salt. This,\r\nhowever, has since been found to be an error, very much lower\r\ntemperatures being obtained by various physical expedients.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of a body is, then, that elevation to which the\r\nthermometer would rise when immersed in that body. Thus, if in\r\nplunging the thermometer in water we found the mercury to rise or\r\nfall to the division marked 100, we should then say, the\r\ntemperature of the water was 100°.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose a spirit lamp, or other regular source of heat,\r\napplied to a bath of mercury, so as to maintain the mercury at a\r\nfixed temperature of 200°, and let another vessel, containing a\r\nquantity of ice at a temperature of 20° be immersed in the\r\nmercury. Let a thermometer be placed in the mercury, and another\r\nin the ice. The following effects will then ensue. The thermometer\r\nimmersed in the ice will be observed gradually to rise from 20°\r\nupwards, until it indicates the temperature of 32°. It will then\r\nbecome stationary, and the ice which had hitherto remained in a\r\nsolid state will begin to melt and be converted into water. This\r\nprocess of liquefaction will continue for a considerable time,\r\nduring which the thermometer immersed in the ice will constantly\r\nbe maintained at 32°. At the moment, however, when the last\r\nportion of ice is liquefied, the thermometer will begin again to\r\nrise. The coincidence of this ascent of the thermometer with the\r\ncompletion of the liquefaction of the ice, may be very easily\r\nobserved, because the ice being lighter, bulk for bulk, than\r\nwater, will float on the surface, and so long as a particle of it\r\nremains unmelted it will be distinctly seen.\r\n\r\nNow it cannot be doubted that, during the whole of this process,\r\nthe mercury, supposed to be maintained at 200°, constantly imparts\r\nheat to the ice; yet, from the moment the liquefaction begins,\r\nuntil it is completed, no increased temperature is exhibited by\r\nthe thermometer immersed in the melting ice. If during this part\r\nof the process no heat were received by the ice from the mercury,\r\nthe consequence would be, that the application of the lamp would\r\ncause the temperature of the mercury to rise above 200°, which may\r\nbe easily demonstrated by withdrawing the vessel of ice from the\r\nmercurial bath during the process of liquefaction. The moment\r\n[Pg101] it is withdrawn, the thermometer immersed in the mercury,\r\ninstead of remaining fixed at 200°, will begin to rise, although\r\nthe action of the lamp remains the same as before; from which it\r\nis evident that the heat which now causes the mercury to rise\r\nabove 200° was before received by the melting ice.\r\n\r\nThe heat which thus enters ice in the process of liquefaction, and\r\nwhich is not indicated by the thermometer, is for this reason\r\ncalled _latent heat_. It will be perceived that this phrase is the\r\nname of a fact, and not of an hypothesis. That heat really enters\r\nthe water, and is contained in it, has been established by the\r\nexperiments; and to declare that it is present there, is to\r\ndeclare an established fact. To call it by the name _latent_ heat,\r\nis to declare another established fact, viz., that it is not\r\nsensible to the thermometer.\r\n\r\nThese facts show us that heat is capable of existing in bodies in\r\ntwo distinct states, in one of which it is sensible to the\r\nthermometer, and in the other not. Heat which is sensible to the\r\nthermometer is called, for distinction, _sensible_ or _free heat_.\r\nIt may be here observed, that heat which is sensible to the\r\nthermometer is also perceptible by the senses, and heat not\r\nsensible to the thermometer is not perceptible by the senses.\r\nThus, ice at 32° and water at 32° _feel_ equally cold, and yet we\r\nhave seen that the latter contains considerably more heat than the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nDr. Black, who first noticed the remarkable fact to which we have\r\nnow alluded, inferred that ice is converted into water by\r\ncommunicating to it a certain quantity or dose of heat, which\r\nenters into combination with it in a manner analogous to that\r\nwhich takes place when bodies combine chemically. The heat, thus\r\ncombined with the solid ice, loses its property of affecting the\r\nsenses or the thermometer, and the effects therefore bear a\r\nresemblance to those cases of chemical combination in which the\r\nconstituent elements change their sensible properties when they\r\nform the compound.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the thermometer immersed in the ice remains stationary\r\nonly as long as the process of liquefaction is going on, shows that\r\nthis absorption of heat is necessarily connected with that process,\r\nand that, were it not for the conversion of [Pg102] the solid ice\r\ninto liquid water, the heat which is so received would be sensible,\r\nand would cause the thermometer immersed in the ice to rise. Before\r\nthe time of Black it was supposed that the slightest addition of\r\nheat would cause solid ice to be converted into water, and that the\r\nthermometer would immediately pass from the freezing temperature to\r\nhigher degrees. The experiments above described, however, show the\r\nfalsehood of such a supposition. If, while the mercurial bath, in\r\nwhich the ice is immersed, is maintained at the temperature of 200°,\r\nthe length of time necessary to complete the liquefaction of the ice\r\nbe observed, it would be found that that time is about twenty-eight\r\ntimes the length of time which it would take to raise the liquid\r\nwater from 32° to 37°; and if it be assumed that the same quantity\r\nof heat is imparted to the ice, during the process of liquefaction,\r\nduring each minute, as is imparted to the water, during each minute,\r\nin rising from 32° to 37°, it will follow, that to liquefy the ice\r\nrequires twenty-eight times as much heat as is necessary to raise\r\nthe water from 32° to 37°. It appears, therefore, that, instead of a\r\nsmall quantity of heat being necessary to melt the ice, a very\r\nconsiderable portion is absorbed in that process.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained the remarkable fact, that heat is absorbed in a\r\nlarge quantity in the conversion of ice into water, without\r\nrendering the body so absorbing it warmer, let us now inquire what\r\nthe exact quantity of heat so absorbed is. We have already stated\r\nthat, if the quantity communicated in equal times be the same, the\r\nheat necessary to liquefy a given weight of ice would be\r\ntwenty-eight times as much as would be necessary to raise the same\r\nweight of water from 32° to 37°; or, if the heat necessary to\r\nraise water through every 5° be the same, that quantity of heat\r\nwould be sufficient to raise water from 32° to 172°: and hence we\r\ninfer, that as much heat is absorbed in the liquefaction of a\r\ngiven quantity of ice as would raise the same quantity of water\r\nthrough 140 degrees of the thermometric scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n(52.) Let us now examine the analogous effects produced by the\r\ncontinued application of heat to water in the liquid state.\r\n\r\nLet a small quantity of water be placed in a glass flask of\r\nconsiderable size, and then closed so as to prevent the escape\r\n[Pg103] of any vapour. Let this vessel be now placed over the\r\nflame of a spirit lamp, so as to cause the water it contains to\r\nboil. For a considerable time the water will be observed to boil,\r\nand apparently to diminish in quantity, until at length all the\r\nwater disappears, and the vessel is apparently empty. If the\r\nvessel be now removed from the lamp, and suspended in a cool\r\natmosphere, the whole of the interior of its surface will\r\npresently appear to be covered with a dewy moisture; and at length\r\na quantity of water will collect in the bottom of it, equal to\r\nthat which had been in it at the commencement of the process. That\r\nno water has at any period of the experiment escaped from it, may\r\nbe easily determined, by performing the experiment with the glass\r\nflask suspended from the arm of a balance, counterpoised by a\r\nsufficient weight suspended from the other arm. The equilibrium\r\nwill be preserved throughout, and the vessel will be found to have\r\nthe same weight, when to all appearance it is empty, as when it\r\ncontains the liquid water. It is evident, therefore, that the\r\nwater exists in the vessel in every stage of the process, but that\r\nit becomes invisible when the process of boiling has continued for\r\na certain length of time; and it may be shown that it will\r\ncontinue to be invisible, provided the flask be exposed to a\r\ntemperature considerably elevated. Thus, for example, if it be\r\nsuspended in a vessel of boiling water, the water which it\r\ncontains will continue to be invisible; but the moment it is\r\nwithdrawn from the boiling water, and exposed to the cold air, the\r\nwater will again become visible, as above mentioned, forming a dew\r\non the inner surface, and finally collecting in the bottom, as in\r\nthe commencement of the experiment.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the liquid has, by the process of boiling, been converted\r\ninto _vapour_, or _steam_, which is a body similar in its leading\r\nproperties to common air, and, like it, is invisible. It will\r\nhereafter appear that it likewise possesses the property of\r\nelasticity, and other mechanical qualities enjoyed by gases in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n\r\n(53.) Again, let an open vessel be filled with water at 60°, and\r\nplaced in a mercurial bath, which is maintained, by a fire or lamp\r\napplied to it, at the temperature of 230°. Place a thermometer in\r\nthe water, and it will be observed gradually to [Pg104] rise as\r\nthe temperature of the water is increased by the heat which it\r\nreceives from the mercury in which it is immersed. The water will\r\nsteadily rise in this manner until it attains the temperature of\r\n212°; but here the thermometer immersed in it will become\r\nstationary. At the same time the water contained in the vessel\r\nwill become agitated, and its surface will present the same\r\nappearance as if bubbles of air were rising from the bottom, and\r\nissuing at the top. A cloudy vapour will be given off in large\r\nquantities from its surface. This process is called _ebullition_\r\nor _boiling_. If it be continued for any considerable time, the\r\nquantity of water in the vessel will be sensibly diminished; and\r\nat length every particle of it will disappear, and the vessel will\r\nremain empty. During the whole of this process, the thermometer\r\nimmersed in the water will remain stationary at 212°.\r\n\r\nNow, it will be asked, what has become of the water? It cannot be\r\nimagined that it has been annihilated. We shall be able to answer\r\nthis by adopting means to prevent the escape of any particle of\r\nmatter from the vessel containing the water, into the atmosphere\r\nor elsewhere. Let us suppose that the top of the vessel containing\r\nthe water is closed, with the exception of a neck communicating\r\nwith a tube, and let that tube be carried into another close\r\nvessel removed from the cistern of heated mercury, and plunged in\r\nanother cistern of cold water. Such an apparatus is represented in\r\n_fig._ 15.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 15.]\r\n\r\nA is a cistern of heated mercury, in which the glass vessel B,\r\ncontaining water, is immersed. From the top of the vessel B\r\nproceeds a glass tube C, inclining downwards, and entering a glass\r\nvessel D, which is immersed in a cistern E of cold water. If the\r\nprocess already described be continued until the water by constant\r\nebullition has disappeared, as already mentioned, [Pg105] from\r\nthe vessel B, it will be found that a quantity of water will be\r\ncollected in the vessel D; and if this water be weighed, it will\r\nbe found to have exactly the same weight as the water had which\r\nwas originally placed in the vessel B. It is, therefore, quite\r\napparent that the water has passed by the process of boiling from\r\nthe one vessel to the other; but, in its passage, it was not\r\nperceptible by the sight. The tube C and the upper part of the\r\nvessel B, had the same appearance, exactly, as if they had been\r\nfilled with atmospheric air. That they are not merely filled with\r\natmospheric air may, however, be easily proved. When the process\r\nof boiling first commences, it will be found that the tube C is\r\ncold, and the inner surface dry. When the process of ebullition\r\nhas continued a short time, the tube C will become gradually\r\nheated, and the inner surface of it covered with moisture. After a\r\ntime, however, this moisture disappears, and the tube attains the\r\ntemperature 212°. In this state it continues until the whole of\r\nthe water is discharged from the vessel B to the vessel D.\r\n\r\n\r\n(54.) These effects are easily explained. The water in the vessel\r\nB is incapable of receiving any higher temperature than 212°,\r\nconsistently with its retaining the liquid form. Small portions,\r\ntherefore, are constantly converted into steam by the heat\r\nreceived from the surrounding mercury, and bubbles of steam are\r\nformed on the bottom and sides of the vessel B. These bubbles,\r\nbeing very much lighter, bulk for bulk, than water, rise rapidly\r\nthrough the water, just in the same manner as bubbles of air\r\nwould, and produce that peculiar agitation at its surface which\r\nhas been taken as the external indication of boiling. They escape\r\nfrom the surface, and collect in the upper part of the vessel. The\r\nsteam thus collected, when it first enters the tube C, is cooled\r\nbelow the temperature of 212° by the surface of the tube; and\r\nconsequently, being incapable of remaining in the state of vapour\r\nat any lower temperature than 212°, it is reconverted into water,\r\nand forms the dewy moisture which is observed in the commencement\r\nof the process on the interior of the tube C. At length, however,\r\nthe whole of the tube C is heated to the temperature of 212°, and\r\nthe moisture which was previously collected upon its inner\r\n[Pg106] surface is again converted into steam. As the quantity of\r\nsteam evolved from the water in B increases, it drives before it\r\nthe steam previously collected in the tube C, and forces it into\r\nthe vessel B. Here it encounters the inner surface of this vessel,\r\nwhich is kept constantly cold by being surrounded with the cold\r\nwater in which it is immersed; and the vapour, being thus\r\nimmediately reduced below the temperature of 212°, is reconverted\r\ninto water. At first it collects in a dew on the surface of the\r\nvessel D; but as this accumulates, it drops into the bottom of the\r\nvessel, and forms a more considerable quantity. As the quantity of\r\nwater is observed to be gradually diminished in the vessel B, the\r\nquantity will be found to be gradually increased in the vessel D;\r\nand if the operation be suspended at any stage of the process, and\r\nthe water in the two vessels weighed, it will be found that the\r\nweight of the water in D is exactly equal to the weight which the\r\nwater in B has lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n(55.) The demonstration is, therefore, perfect, that the gradual\r\ndiminution of the boiling water in the vessel B is produced by the\r\nconversion of that water into steam by the heat. In the process\r\nfirst described, when the top of the vessel B was supposed to be\r\nopen, this steam made its escape into the air, where it was first\r\ndispersed, and subsequently cooled in separate particles, and was\r\ndeposited in minute globules of moisture on the ground and on\r\nsurrounding objects.\r\n\r\n\r\n(56.) In reviewing this process, we are struck by the fact, that\r\nthe continued application of heat to the vessel B is incapable of\r\nraising the temperature of the water contained in it above 212°.\r\nThis presents an obvious analogy to the process of liquefaction,\r\nand leads to inquiries of a similar nature, which are attended\r\nwith a like result. We must either infer, that the water, having\r\narrived at 212°, received no more heat from the mercury; or that\r\nsuch heat, if received, is incapable of affecting the thermometer;\r\nor, finally, that the steam which passes off carries this heat\r\nwith it. That the water receive heat from the mercury, will be\r\nproved by the fact, that, if the vessel B be removed from the\r\nmercury, other things remaining as before, the temperature of the\r\nmercury will rapidly rise, and if the fire be continued, it will\r\neven boil; but so long as the [Pg107] vessel B remains immersed,\r\nit prevents the mercury from increasing in temperature. It\r\ntherefore receives that heat which would otherwise raise the\r\ntemperature of the quicksilver.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 16.]\r\n\r\nIf a thermometer be immersed in the steam which collects in the\r\nupper part of the vessel B, it will show the same temperature (of\r\n212°) as the water from which it is raised. The heat, therefore,\r\nreceived from the mercury, is clearly not imparted in a sensible\r\nform to the steam, which has the same temperature in the form of\r\nsteam as it had in the form of water. What has been already\r\nexplained respecting liquefaction would lead us, by analogy, to\r\nsuspect that the heat imparted by the mercury to the water has\r\nbecome latent in the steam, and is instrumental to the conversion\r\nof water into steam, in the same manner as heat has been shown to\r\nbe instrumental to the conversion of ice into water. As the fact\r\nwas in that case detected by mixing ice with water, so we shall,\r\nin the present instance, try it by a like test, viz. by mixing\r\nwater with steam. Let about five ounces and a half of water, at\r\nthe temperature of 32°, be placed in a vessel A (_fig._ 16.), and\r\nlet another vessel B, in which water is kept constantly boiling at\r\nthe temperature of 212°, communicate with A by a pipe C proceeding\r\nfrom the top, so that the steam may be conducted from B, and\r\nescape from the mouth of the pipe at some depth below the surface\r\nof the water in A. As the steam issues from the pipe, it will be\r\nimmediately reconverted into water by the cold water which it\r\nencounters; and, by continuing this process, the water in A will\r\nbe gradually heated by the steam combined with it and received\r\nthrough the pipe C. If this process be continued until the water\r\nin A is raised to the temperature of 212°, it will boil. Let it\r\nthen be weighed, and it will be found to weigh six ounces and a\r\nhalf: from whence we infer, that one ounce of water has been\r\nreceived from the vessel B in the form of steam, and has been\r\nreconverted into water by the inferior temperature of the water in\r\nA. Now, this ounce of water received in the form of steam into the\r\nvessel A had, when in that form, the temperature of 212°. It is\r\nnow [Pg108] converted into the liquid form, and still retains the\r\nsame temperature of 212°; but it has caused the five ounces and a\r\nhalf of water with which it has been mixed, to rise from the\r\ntemperature of 32° to the temperature of 212°,—and this, _without\r\nlosing any temperature itself_. It follows, therefore, that, in\r\nreturning to the liquid state, it has parted with as much heat as\r\nis capable of raising five times and a half its own weight of\r\nwater from 32° to 212°. This heat was combined with the steam,\r\nthough not sensible to the thermometer; and was, therefore,\r\n_latent_. Had it been sensible in the water in B, it would have\r\ncaused the water to have risen through a number of thermometric\r\ndegrees, amounting to five times and a half the excess of 212°\r\nabove 32°; that is, through five times and a half 180°; for it has\r\ncaused five times and a half its own weight of water to receive an\r\nequal increase of temperature. But five times and a half 180° is\r\n990°, or, to use round numbers (for minute accuracy is not here\r\nour object), 1000°. It follows, therefore, that an ounce of water,\r\nin passing from the liquid state at 212° to the state of steam at\r\n212°, receives as much heat as would be sufficient to raise it\r\nthrough 1000 thermometric degrees, if that heat, instead of\r\nbecoming latent, had been sensible.\r\n\r\n\r\n(57.) In order to derive all the knowledge from these experiments\r\nwhich they are capable of imparting, it will be necessary to\r\nexamine very carefully how water comports itself under a variety\r\nof different circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf water be boiled in an open vessel, with a thermometer immersed,\r\non different days, it will be observed that the fixed temperature\r\nwhich it assumes in boiling will be subject to a variation within\r\ncertain small limits. Thus, at one time, it will be found to boil\r\nat the temperature of 210°; while, at others, the thermometer\r\nimmersed in it will rise to 213°; and, on different occasions, it\r\nwill fix itself at different points within these limits. It will\r\nalso be found, if the same experiment be performed at the same\r\ntime in distant places, that the boiling points will be subject to\r\na like variation. Now, it is natural to inquire what cause\r\nproduces this variation; and we shall be led to the discovery of\r\nthe cause, by examining what other physical effects undergo a\r\nsimultaneous change. [Pg109]\r\n\r\nIf we observe the height of the barometer at the time of making\r\neach experiment, we shall find a very remarkable correspondence\r\nbetween it and the boiling temperature. Invariably, whenever the\r\nbarometer stands at the same height, the boiling temperature will\r\nbe the same. Thus, if the barometer stands at 30 inches, the\r\nboiling temperature will be 212°. If the barometer fall to 29-1/2\r\ninches, the thermometer stands at a small fraction above 211°. If\r\nthe barometer rise to 30-1/2 inches, the boiling temperature rises\r\nto nearly 213°. The variation in the boiling temperature is, then,\r\naccompanied by a variation in the pressure of the atmosphere\r\nindicated by the barometer; and it is constantly found that the\r\nboiling point will remain unchanged, so long as the atmospheric\r\npressure remains unchanged, and that every increase in the one\r\ncauses a corresponding increase in the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n(58.) From these facts it must be inferred, that the pressure\r\nexcited on the surface of the water has a tendency to resist its\r\nebullition, and to make it necessary, before it can boil, that it\r\nshould receive a higher temperature; and, on the contrary, that\r\nevery diminution of pressure on the surface of the water will give\r\nan increased facility to the process of ebullition, or will cause\r\nthat process to take place at a lower temperature. As these facts\r\nare of the utmost importance in the theory of heat, it may be\r\nuseful to verify them by direct experiment.\r\n\r\nIf the variable pressure excited on the surface of the water by\r\nthe atmosphere be the cause of the change in the boiling\r\ntemperature, it must happen, that any change of pressure produced\r\nby artificial means on the surface of the water must likewise\r\nchange the boiling point, according to the same law. Thus, if a\r\npressure considerably greater than the atmospheric pressure be\r\nexcited on a liquid, the boiling point may be expected to rise\r\nconsiderably above 212°; and, on the other hand, if the surface of\r\nthe water be relieved from the pressure of the atmosphere, and be\r\nsubmitted to a considerably diminished pressure, the water would\r\nboil below 212°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 17.]\r\n\r\nLet B (_fig._ 17.) be a strong spherical vessel of brass, supported\r\non a stand S, under which is placed a large spirit lamp L, or other\r\nmeans of heating it. In the top of this vessel are three apertures,\r\nin two of which are screwed a [Pg110] thermometer T, the bulb of\r\nwhich enters the hollow brass sphere, and a stop-cock C, which may\r\nbe closed or opened at pleasure, to confine the steam, or allow it\r\nto escape. In the third aperture at the top, is screwed a long\r\nbarometer tube, open at both ends. The lower end of this tube\r\nextends nearly to the bottom of the spherical vessel B. In the\r\nbottom of this vessel is placed a quantity of mercury, the surface\r\nof which rises to some height above the lower end of the tube A.\r\nOver the mercury is poured a quantity of water, so as to half fill\r\nthe vessel B. Matters being thus arranged, the screws are made\r\ntight, so as to confine the water, and the lamp is allowed to act on\r\nthe vessel; the temperature of the water is raised, and steam is\r\nproduced, which, being confined within the vessel, exerts its\r\npressure on the surface of the water, and resists its ebullition.\r\nThe pressure of the steam acting on the surface of the water is\r\ncommunicated to the surface of the mercury, and it forces a portion\r\nof the mercury into the tube A, which presently rises above the\r\npoint where the tube is screwed into the top of the vessel B. As the\r\naction of the lamp continues, the thermometer T exhibits a gradually\r\nincreasing temperature; while the column of mercury in A shows the\r\nforce with which the steam presses on the surface of the water in\r\nB,—this column being balanced by the pressure of the steam. Thus,\r\nthe temperature and pressure of the steam at the same moment may\r\nalways be observed by inspecting the thermometer T and the tube A.\r\nWhen the column in the tube A has risen to the height of 30 inches\r\nabove the level of the mercury in the vessel B, then the pressure of\r\nthe steam will be equivalent to double the pressure of the\r\natmosphere, because, the tube A being open at the top, the\r\natmosphere presses on the [Pg111] surface of the mercury in it. The\r\nthermometer T will be observed gradually to rise until it attains\r\nthe temperature of 212°; but it will not stop there, as it would do\r\nif immersed in water boiled in an open vessel. It will, on the other\r\nhand, continue to rise; and when the column of mercury in A has\r\nattained the height of 30 inches, the thermometer T will have risen\r\nto 251°,—being 39° above the ordinary boiling point.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this process, the surface of the water being\r\nsubmitted to a constantly increasing pressure, its ebullition is\r\nprevented, and it continues to receive heat without boiling. That\r\nit is the increased pressure which resists its ebullition, and\r\ncauses it to receive a temperature above 212°, may be easily\r\nshown. Let the stop-cock C be opened; immediately the steam in B,\r\nhaving a pressure considerably greater than that of the\r\natmosphere, will rush out, and will continue to issue from C,\r\nuntil its pressure is balanced by the atmosphere. At the same time\r\nthe column of mercury in A will be observed rapidly to fall, and\r\nto sink below the orifice by which it is inserted in the vessel B.\r\nThe thermometer T will also fall until it attains the temperature\r\nof 212°. At that point, however, it will remain stationary; and\r\nthe water will now be distinctly heard to be in a state of rapid\r\nebullition. If the stop-cock C be once more closed, the\r\nthermometer will begin to rise, and the column of mercury\r\nascending in A will be again visible.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of a stop-cock being at C, the aperture were made to\r\ncommunicate with a valve, like the safety-valve of a steam engine,\r\nloaded with a certain weight,—say at the rate of 15 lbs. on the\r\nsquare inch,—then the thermometer T, and the mercury in the tube\r\nA, would not rise indefinitely as before. The thermometer would\r\ncontinue to rise till it attained the temperature of 251°; and the\r\nmercury in the tube A would rise to the height of 30 inches. At\r\nthis limit the resistance of the valve would be balanced by the\r\npressure of the steam; and as fast as the water would have a\r\ntendency to produce steam of a higher pressure, the valve would be\r\nraised and the steam suffered to escape; the thermometer T and the\r\ncolumn of mercury in A remaining stationary during this process.\r\nIf the valve were loaded more heavily, the phenomena would be\r\n[Pg112] the same, only that the mercury in T and A would become\r\nstationary at certain heights. But, on the other hand, if the\r\nvalve were loaded at a less pressure than 15 lbs. on the square\r\ninch, then the mercury in the two tubes would become stationary at\r\nlower points.\r\n\r\n\r\n(59.) These experiments show that every increase of pressure above\r\nthe ordinary pressure of the atmosphere causes an increase in the\r\ntemperature at which water boils. We shall now inquire whether a\r\ndiminution of pressure will produce a corresponding effect on the\r\nboiling point.\r\n\r\nThis may be easily accomplished by the aid of an air pump. Let\r\nwater at the temperature of 200° be placed in a glass vessel under\r\nthe receiver of an air pump, and let the air be gradually\r\nwithdrawn. After a few strokes of the pump, the water will boil;\r\nand if the mercurial gauge of the pump be observed, it will be\r\nfound that its altitude will be about 23-1/2 inches. Thus the\r\npressure to which the water is submitted has been reduced from the\r\nordinary pressure of the atmosphere expressed by the column of 30\r\ninches of mercury, to a diminished pressure expressed by 23-1/2\r\ninches; and we find that the temperature at which the water boils\r\nhas been lowered from 212° to 200°. Let the same experiment be\r\nrepeated with water at the temperature of 180°, and it will be\r\nfound that a further rarefaction of the air is necessary, but the\r\nwater will at length boil. If the gauge of the pump be now\r\nobserved, it will be found to stand at about fifteen inches,\r\nshowing, that at the temperature of 180° water will boil under\r\nhalf the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere. These experiments\r\nmay be varied and repeated; and it will be always found, that, as\r\nthe pressure is diminished or increased, the temperature at which\r\nthe water will boil will be also diminished or increased.\r\n\r\n\r\n(60.) The same effects may be exhibited in a striking manner\r\nwithout an air pump, by producing a vacuum by the condensation of\r\nsteam. Let a small quantity of water be placed in a thin glass\r\nflask, and let it be boiled by holding it over a spirit lamp. When\r\nthe steam is observed to issue abundantly from the mouth of the\r\nflask, let it be quickly corked and removed from the lamp. The\r\nprocess of boiling will then cease, and the water will become\r\nquiescent; but if the flask be plunged [Pg113] in a vessel of\r\ncold water, the water it contains will again pass into a state of\r\nviolent ebullition, thus exhibiting the singular fact of water\r\nbeing boiled by cooling it. This effect is produced by the cold\r\nmedium in which the flask is immersed, causing the steam above the\r\nsurface of the water in it to be condensed, and therefore\r\nrelieving the water from its pressure. The water, under these\r\ncircumstances, boils at a lower temperature than when submitted to\r\nthe pressure of the uncondensed vapour.\r\n\r\n\r\n(61.) There is no limit to the temperature to which water may be\r\nraised, if it be submitted to a sufficient pressure to resist its\r\ntendency to take the vaporous form. If a strong metallic vessel be\r\nnearly filled with water, so as to prevent the liquid from\r\nescaping by any force which it can exert, the water thus inclosed\r\nmay be heated to any temperature whatever without boiling; in\r\nfact, it may be made red-hot; and the temperature to which it may\r\nbe raised will have no limit, except the strength of the vessel\r\ncontaining it, or the point at which the metal of which it is\r\nformed may begin to soften or to be fused.\r\n\r\n\r\n(62.) The following table will show the temperature at which water\r\nwill boil under different pressures of the atmosphere corresponding\r\nto the altitudes of the barometer between 26 and 31 inches.\r\n\r\n  Barometer.

In the experiment already described, by which the latent\r\n[Pg114] heat of steam was determined, the water was supposed to be\r\nboiled under the ordinary pressure of the atmosphere. Having seen,\r\nhowever, that water may boil at different temperatures, under\r\ndifferent pressures, the inquiry presents itself, whether the heat\r\nabsorbed in vaporisation at different temperatures, and under\r\ndifferent pressures, is subject to any variation? Experiments of\r\nthe same nature as those already described, instituted upon water\r\nin a state of ebullition at different temperatures, as well below\r\nas above 212°, have led to the discovery of a very remarkable fact\r\nin the theory of vapour. It has been found that the heat absorbed\r\nby vaporisation is always less, the higher the temperature at\r\nwhich the ebullition takes place; and less, by the same amount as\r\nthe temperature of ebullition is increased. Thus, if water boil at\r\n312°, the heat absorbed in ebullition will be less by 100° than if\r\nit boiled at 212°; and again, if water be boiled under a\r\ndiminished pressure, at 112°, the heat absorbed in vaporisation\r\nwill be 100° more than the heat absorbed by water boiled at 212°.\r\nIt follows, therefore, that the actual consumption of heat in the\r\nprocess of vaporisation must be the same, whatever be the\r\ntemperature at which the vaporisation takes place; for whatever\r\nheat is saved in the sensible form, is consumed in the latent\r\nform, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose a given weight of water at the temperature of 32°\r\nto be exposed to any regular source by which heat may be supplied\r\nto it. If it be under the ordinary atmospheric pressure, the first\r\n180° of heat which it receives will raise it to the boiling point,\r\nand the next 1000° will convert it into steam. Thus, in addition\r\nto the heat which it contains at 32°, the steam at 212° contains\r\n1180° of heat. But if the same water be submitted to a pressure\r\nequal to half the atmospheric pressure, then the first 148° of\r\nheat which it receives will cause it to boil, and the next 1032°\r\nwill convert it into vapour. Thus, steam at the temperature of\r\n180° contains a quantity of heat more than the same quantity of\r\nwater at 32°, by 1032° added to 148°, which gives a sum of 1180°.\r\nSteam, therefore, raised under the ordinary pressure of the\r\natmosphere at 212°, and steam raised under half that pressure at\r\n180°, contain the same quantity of heat,—with this difference\r\n[Pg115] only—that the one has more latent heat, and less sensible\r\nheat, than the other.\r\n\r\nFrom this fact, that the sum of the latent and sensible heats of\r\nthe vapour of water is constant, it follows that the same quantity\r\nof heat is necessary to convert a given weight of water into\r\nsteam, at whatever temperature, or under whatever pressure, the\r\nwater may be boiled. It follows, also, that, in the steam engine,\r\nequal weights of high-pressure and low-pressure steam are produced\r\nby the same consumption of fuel; and that, in general, the\r\nconsumption of fuel is proportional to the quantity of water\r\nvaporised, whatever the pressure of the steam may be.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\n(64.) Having explained the conditions under which, by supplying\r\nheat to water, it is converted into steam, and, by abstracting\r\nheat from steam, it may be reconverted into water, let us now\r\nconsider the mechanical force which is developed in these\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 18.]\r\n\r\nLet A B (_fig._ 18.) be a tube, or cylinder, the base of which is\r\nequal to a square inch, and let a piston P move in it so as to be\r\nsteam-tight. Let it be supposed, that under this piston there is,\r\nin the bottom of the cylinder, a cubic inch of water between the\r\nbottom of the piston and the bottom of the tube; let the piston be\r\ncounterbalanced by a weight W acting over a pulley, which will be\r\njust sufficient to counterpoise the weight of the piston, so as\r\nleave no force tending to keep the piston down, except the force\r\nof the atmosphere acting above it. Under the circumstances here\r\nsupposed, the piston being in contact with the water, and all air\r\nbeing excluded, it will be pressed down by the weight of the\r\natmosphere, which we will suppose to be fifteen pounds, the\r\nmagnitude of the piston being a square inch. [Pg116]\r\n\r\nNow let the flame of a lamp be applied at the bottom of the tube;\r\nthe water under the piston having its temperature thereby\r\ngradually raised, and being submitted to no pressure save that of\r\nthe atmosphere above the piston, it will begin to be converted\r\ninto steam when it has attained the temperature of 212°. According\r\nas it is converted into steam, it will cause the piston to ascend\r\nin the tube until all the water has been evaporated. If the tube\r\nwere constructed of sufficient length, the piston then would be\r\nfound to have risen to the height of about seventeen hundred\r\ninches, or one hundred and forty-two feet; since, as has been\r\nalready explained, water passing into steam under the ordinary\r\npressure of the atmosphere undergoes an increase of bulk in the\r\nproportion of about seventeen hundred to one.\r\n\r\nNow in this process, the air above the piston, which presses on it\r\nwith a force equal to fifteen pounds, has been raised one hundred\r\nand forty-two feet. It appears, therefore, that, by the\r\nevaporation of a cubic inch of water under a pressure equal to\r\nfifteen pounds per square inch, a mechanical force of this amount\r\nis developed.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that fifteen pounds raised one hundred and forty-two\r\nfeet successively, is equivalent to one hundred and forty-two\r\ntimes fifteen pounds raised one foot. Now, one hundred and\r\nforty-two times fifteen is two thousand one hundred and thirty,\r\nand therefore the force thus obtained is equal to two thousand one\r\nhundred and thirty pounds raised one foot high. This being within\r\nabout 110 pounds of a ton, it may be stated, in round numbers,\r\nthat, by the evaporation of a cubic inch of water under these\r\ncircumstances, a force is obtained equal to that which would raise\r\na ton weight a foot high.\r\n\r\nThe augmentation of volume which water undergoes in passing into\r\nsteam under the pressure here supposed, may be easily retained in\r\nthe memory, from the accidental circumstance that a cubic inch of\r\nwater is converted into a cubic foot of steam, very nearly. A\r\ncubic foot contains one thousand seven hundred and twenty-eight\r\ncubic inches,—which is little different from the proportion which\r\nsteam bears to water, when raised under the atmospheric pressure.\r\n[Pg117]\r\n\r\n\r\n(65.) It will, therefore, be an advantage to retain in memory the\r\nfollowing general facts:—\r\n\r\n1. _A cubic inch of water evaporated under the ordinary\r\natmospheric pressure, is converted into a cubic foot of steam._\r\n\r\n2. _A cubic inch of water evaporated under the atmospheric\r\npressure, gives a mechanical force equal to what would raise about\r\na ton weight a foot high._\r\n\r\n\r\n(66.) Let us, again, suppose the piston P (_fig._ 23.) to be\r\nrestored to its original position, with the liquid water beneath\r\nit; and, in addition to the weight of the atmosphere which before\r\npressed it down, let us suppose another weight of fifteen pounds\r\nlaid upon it, so that the water below shall be pressed by double\r\nthe weight of the atmosphere. If the lamp were now applied, and at\r\nthe same time a thermometer were immersed in the water, it would\r\nbe found that the water would not begin to be converted into steam\r\nuntil it attained the temperature of about 250°. The piston would\r\nthen begin, as before, to ascend, and the water to be gradually\r\nconverted into vapour. The water being completely evaporated, it\r\nwould be found that the piston would be raised to a height little\r\nmore than half its former height, or 72 feet. The mechanical\r\neffect, therefore, thus obtained, will be equivalent to double the\r\nformer weight raised half the former height.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, if the piston were loaded with thirty pounds in\r\naddition to the atmosphere, the whole pressure on the water being\r\nthen three times the pressure first supposed, the piston would be\r\nraised to somewhat more than one third of its first height by the\r\nevaporation of the water. This would give a mechanical force\r\nequivalent to three times the original weight raised a little more\r\nthan one third of the original height.\r\n\r\nIn general, as the pressure on the piston is increased, the height\r\nto which the piston would be raised by the evaporation of the\r\nwater will be diminished in a proportion somewhat less than the\r\nproportion in which the pressure on the piston is increased. If\r\nthe temperature at which the water is converted into steam under\r\nthese different pressures were the same, then the height to which\r\nthe piston would be raised by the evaporation of the water would\r\nbe diminished in precisely [Pg118] the same proportion as the\r\npressure on the piston is increased; and, in that case, the whole\r\nmechanical force developed by the evaporation of the water would\r\nremain exactly the same under whatever pressure the water might be\r\nboiled. We shall explain hereafter the extent to which the\r\nvariation of temperature in the water and steam corresponding to\r\nthe variation of pressure modifies this law; but, as the effect of\r\nthe difference of temperatures is not considerable, it will be\r\nconvenient to register in the memory the following important\r\npractical conclusion:—\r\n\r\n\r\n(67.) _A cubic inch of water converted into steam will supply a\r\nmechanical force very nearly equal to a ton weight raised a foot\r\nhigh; and this force will not be subject to considerable\r\nvariation, whatever be the temperature or pressure at which the\r\nwater may be evaporated._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLASGOW.]\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [18] The preceding paragraphs, and some other parts of the\r\n  present volume on the general properties of Heat, are taken\r\n  from my Treatise on Heat, in the _Cabinet Cyclopœdia_, to\r\n  which those who desire more detailed explanation and more\r\n  copious illustration should refer.\r\n\r\n[Pg119]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLASGOW COLLEGE.]\r\n\r\nCHAP.

At the period to which we have now brought the history of\r\nthe invention of the steam engine, Watt had obtained, chiefly by\r\nhis own experiments, a sufficient knowledge of the phenomena which\r\nhave been just explained, to enable him to arrive at the\r\nconclusion that a very small proportion of the whole mechanical\r\neffect attending the evaporation was really rendered available by\r\nthe atmospheric engine; and that, [Pg120] therefore, extensive\r\nand injurious sources of waste existed in its machinery.\r\n\r\nHe perceived that the principal source of this wasteful\r\nexpenditure of power consisted in the quantity of steam which was\r\ncondensed at each stroke of the piston, in heating the cylinder\r\nprevious to the ascent of the piston. Yet, as it was evident that\r\nthat ascent could not be accomplished in a cold cylinder, it was\r\napparent that this waste of power must be inevitable, unless some\r\nexpedient could be devised, by which _a vacuum could be maintained\r\nin the cylinder, without cooling it_. But, to produce such a\r\nvacuum, the steam must be condensed; and, to condense the steam,\r\nits temperature must be lowered to such a point that the vapour\r\nproceeding from it shall have no injurious pressure; yet, if\r\ncondensed steam be contained in a cylinder at a high temperature,\r\nit will return to the temperature of the cylinder, recover its\r\nelasticity, and resist the descent of the piston.\r\n\r\nHaving reflected on these circumstances, it became apparent to\r\nWatt, that a vice was inherent in the structure of the atmospheric\r\nengine, which rendered a large waste of power inevitable; this\r\nvice arising from the fact, that the condensation of the steam was\r\nincompatible with the condition of maintaining the elevated\r\ntemperature of the cylinder in which that condensation took place.\r\nIt followed, therefore, either that the steam must be imperfectly\r\ncondensed, or that the condensation could not take place in the\r\ncylinder. It was in 1765, that, pondering on these circumstances,\r\nthe happy idea occurred to him, that the production of a vacuum\r\ncould be equally effected, though _the place_ where the\r\ncondensation of the steam took place were not the cylinder itself.\r\nHe saw, that if a vessel in which a vacuum was produced were put\r\ninto communication with another containing an elastic fluid, the\r\nelastic fluid would rush into the vacuum, and diffuse itself\r\nthrough the two vessels; but if, on rushing into such vacuum, this\r\nelastic fluid, being vapour, were there condensed, or restored to\r\nthe liquid form, that then the space within the two vessels would\r\nbe equally rendered a vacuum;—that, under such circumstances, one\r\nof the vessels might be maintained at any temperature, however\r\nhigh, while [Pg121] the other might be kept at any temperature,\r\nhowever low. This felicitous conception formed the first step in\r\nthat splendid career of invention and discovery which has\r\nconferred immortality on the name of Watt. He used to say, that\r\nthe moment the idea of separate condensation occurred to\r\nhim,—that is, of condensing, in one vessel kept cold, the steam\r\ncoming from another vessel kept hot,—all the details of his\r\nimproved engine rushed into his mind in such rapid succession,\r\nthat, in the course of a day, his invention was so complete that\r\nhe proceeded to submit it to experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 19.]\r\n\r\nTo explain the first conception of this memorable invention; let a\r\ntube or pipe, S (_fig._ 19.), be imagined to proceed from the\r\nbottom of the cylinder A B to a vessel, C, having a stop-cock, D,\r\nby which the communication between the cylinder and the vessel C\r\nmay be opened or closed at pleasure. If we suppose the piston P at\r\nthe top of the cylinder, and the space below it filled with steam,\r\nthe cylinder and steam being at the usual temperature, while the\r\nvessel C is a vacuum, and maintained at a low temperature. Then,\r\non opening the cock D, the steam will rush from the cylinder A B\r\nthrough the tube S, and, passing into the cold vessel C, will be\r\ncondensed by contact with its cold sides. This process of\r\ncondensation will be rendered instantaneous if a jet of cold water\r\nis allowed to play in the vessel C. When the steam thus rushing\r\ninto C, has been destroyed, and the space in the cylinder A B\r\nbecomes a vacuum, then the pressure of the atmosphere being\r\nunobstructed, the piston will descend with the force due to the\r\nexcess of the pressure of the atmosphere above the friction. When\r\nit has descended, suppose the stop-cock D closed, and steam\r\nadmitted from [Pg122] the boiler through a proper cock or valve\r\nbelow the piston, the cylinder and piston being still at the same\r\ntemperature as before. The steam on entering the cylinder, not\r\nbeing exposed to contact with any surface below its own\r\ntemperature, will not be condensed, and therefore will immediately\r\ncause the piston to rise, and the piston will have attained the\r\ntop of the cylinder when as much steam shall have been supplied by\r\nthe boiler as will fill the cylinder. When this has taken place,\r\nsuppose the communication with the boiler cut off, and the cock D\r\nonce more opened: the steam will again rush through the pipe S\r\ninto the vessel C, where encountering the cold surface and the jet\r\nof cold water, it will be condensed, and the vacuum, as before,\r\nwill be produced in the cylinder A B; that cylinder still\r\nmaintaining its temperature, the piston will again descend, and so\r\nthe process may be continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n(69.) Having carried the invention to this point, Watt saw that\r\nthe vessel C would gradually become heated by the steam which\r\nwould be continually condensed in it. To prevent this, as well as\r\nto supply a constant jet of cold water, he proposed to keep the\r\nvessel C submerged in a cistern of cold water, from which a pipe\r\nshould conduct a jet to play within the vessel, so as to condense\r\nthe steam as it would pass from the cylinder.\r\n\r\nBut here a difficulty presented itself, against which it was\r\nnecessary to provide. The cold water admitted through the jet to\r\ncondense the steam, mixed with the condensed steam itself, would\r\ngradually collect in the vessel C, and at length choke it. To\r\nprevent this, Watt proposed to put the vessel C in communication\r\nwith a pump F, which might be wrought by the engine itself, and by\r\nwhich the water, which would collect in the bottom of the vessel\r\nC, would be constantly drawn off. This pump would be evidently\r\nrendered the more necessary, since more or less atmospheric air,\r\nalways combined with water in its common state, would enter the\r\nvessel C by the condensing jet. This air would be disengaged in\r\nthe vessel C by the heat of the steam condensed therein; and it\r\nwould rise through the tube S, and vitiate the vacuum in the\r\ncylinder;—an effect which would be rendered the more injurious,\r\n[Pg123] inasmuch as, unlike steam, this elastic fluid would be\r\nincapable of being condensed by cold. The pump F, therefore, by\r\nwhich Watt proposed to draw off the water from the vessel C, might\r\nalso be made to draw off the air, or the principal part of it.\r\n\r\nThe vessel C was subsequently called a _condenser_; and, from the\r\ncircumstances just adverted to, the pump F has been called the\r\n_air-pump_.\r\n\r\nThese—namely, the cylinder, the condenser, and the air-pump—were\r\nthe three principal parts in the invention, as it first presented\r\nitself to the mind of Watt—and even before it was reduced to a\r\nmodel, or submitted to experiment. But, in addition to these,\r\nother two improvements offered themselves in the very first stage\r\nof its progress.\r\n\r\nIn the atmospheric engine, the piston was maintained steam-tight\r\nin the cylinder by supplying a stream of cold water above it, by\r\nwhich the small interstices between the piston and cylinder would\r\nbe stopped. It is evident that the effect of this water as the\r\npiston descended would be to cool the cylinder, besides which any\r\nportion of it which might pass between the piston and cylinder and\r\nwhich would pass below the piston, would boil the moment it would\r\nfall into the cylinder, which itself would be maintained at the\r\nboiling temperature. This water, therefore, would produce steam,\r\nthe pressure of which would resist the descent of the piston.\r\n\r\nWatt perceived, that even though this inconvenience were removed\r\nby the use of oil or tallow upon the piston, still, that as the\r\npiston would descend in the cylinder, the cold atmosphere would\r\nfollow it; and would, to a certain extent, lower the temperature\r\nof the cylinder. On the next ascent of the piston, this\r\ntemperature would have to be again raised to 212° by the steam\r\ncoming from the boiler, and would entail upon the machine a\r\nproportionate waste of power.\r\n\r\nIf the atmosphere of the engine-house could be kept heated to the\r\ntemperature of boiling water, this inconvenience would be removed.\r\nThe piston would then be pressed down by air as hot as the steam\r\nto be subsequently introduced into it. On further consideration,\r\nhowever, it occurred to Watt that it would be still more\r\nadvantageous if the cylinder itself could be [Pg124] worked in an\r\natmosphere of steam, having only the same pressure as the\r\natmosphere. Such steam would press the piston down as effectually\r\nas the air would; and it would have the further advantage over\r\nair, that if any portion of it leaked through between the piston\r\nand cylinder, it would be condensed, which could not be the case\r\nwith atmospheric air. He therefore determined on surrounding the\r\ncylinder by an external casing, the space between which and the\r\ncylinder he proposed to be filled with steam supplied from the\r\nboiler. The cylinder would thus be enclosed in an atmosphere of\r\nits own, independent of the external air, and the vessel so\r\nenclosing it would only require to be a little larger than the\r\ncylinder, and to have a close cover at the top, the centre of\r\nwhich might be perforated with a hole to admit the rod of the\r\npiston to pass through, the rod being made smooth, and so fitted\r\nto the perforation that no steam should escape between them. This\r\nmethod would be attended also with the advantage of keeping the\r\ncylinder and piston always heated, not only inside but outside;\r\nand Watt saw that it would be further advantageous to employ the\r\npressure of steam to drive the piston in its descent instead of\r\nthe atmosphere, as its intensity or force would be much more\r\nmanageable; for, by increasing or diminishing the heat of the\r\nsteam in which the cylinder was enclosed, its pressure might be\r\nregulated at pleasure, and it might be made to urge the piston\r\nwith any force that might be required. The power of the engine\r\nwould therefore be completely under control, and independent of\r\nall variations in the pressure of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n(70.) This was a step which totally changed the character of the\r\nmachine, and which rendered it a STEAM ENGINE instead of an\r\nATMOSPHERIC ENGINE. Not only was the vacuum below the piston now\r\nproduced by the property of steam, in virtue of which it is\r\nreconverted into water by cold; but the pressure which urged the\r\npiston into this vacuum was due to the elasticity of steam.\r\n\r\nThe external cylinder, within which the working cylinder was\r\nenclosed, was called THE JACKET, and is still very generally used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 20.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(71.) The first experiment in which Watt attempted to [Pg125]\r\nrealise, on a small scale, his conceptions, was made in the\r\nfollowing manner. The cylinder of the engine was represented by a\r\nbrass syringe A B (_fig._ 20.) an inch and a third in diameter, and\r\nten inches in length, to which a top and a bottom of tin plate was\r\nfitted. Steam was conveyed by a pipe, S, from a small boiler into\r\nthe lower end of this syringe, a communication being made with the\r\nupper end of the syringe by a branch pipe D. For the greater\r\nconvenience of the experiment, it was found desirable to invert the\r\nposition of the cylinder, so that the steam should press the piston\r\nP upwards instead of downwards. The piston-rod R therefore was\r\npresented downwards. An eduction pipe E was also inserted in the top\r\nof the cylinder, which was carried to the condenser. The piston-rod\r\nwas made hollow, or rather a hole was drilled longitudinally through\r\nit, and a valve was fitted at its lower end, to carry off the water\r\nproduced by the steam, which [Pg126] would be condensed in the\r\ncylinder in the commencement of the process. The condenser used in\r\nthis experiment operated without injection, the steam being\r\ncondensed by the contact of cold surfaces. It consisted of two thin\r\npipes F, G of tin, ten or twelve inches in length, and the sixth of\r\nan inch in diameter, standing beside each other perpendicularly, and\r\ncommunicating at the top with the eduction pipe, which was provided\r\nwith a valve opening upwards. At the bottom these two pipes\r\ncommunicated with another tube I of about an inch in diameter, by a\r\nhorizontal pipe, having in it a valve, M, opening towards I, fitted\r\nwith a piston K, which served the office of the air-pump, being\r\nworked by the hand. This piston, K, had valves in it opening\r\nupwards. These condensing pipes and air-pump were immersed in a\r\nsmall cistern, filled with cold water. The steam was conveyed by the\r\nsteam-pipe S to the bottom of the cylinder, a communication between\r\nthe top and bottom of the cylinder being occasionally opened by a\r\ncock, C, placed in the branch pipe. The eduction pipe leading to the\r\ncondenser also had a cock, L, by which the communication between the\r\ntop of the cylinder and the condenser might be opened and closed at\r\npleasure. In the commencement of the operation, the cock N admitting\r\nsteam from the boiler, and the cock L opening a communication\r\nbetween the cylinder and the condenser, and the cock C opening a\r\ncommunication between the top and bottom of the cylinder, being all\r\nopen, steam rushed from the boiler, passing through all the pipes,\r\nand filling the cylinder. A current of mixed air and steam was thus\r\nproduced through the eduction pipe E, through the condensing pipes F\r\nand G, and through the air-pump I, which issued from the valve H in\r\nthe eduction pipe, and from the valve in the air-pump piston, all of\r\nwhich opened upwards. The steam also in the cylinder passed through\r\nthe hole drilled in the piston-rod, and escaped, mixed with air,\r\nthrough the valve in the lower end of that rod. This process was\r\ncontinued until all the air in the cylinder, pipes, and condenser,\r\nwas blown out, and all these spaces filled with pure steam. The\r\ncocks L, C, and N, were then closed, and the atmospheric pressure\r\nclosed the valve H and the valves in the air-pump piston. The cold\r\nsurfaces condensing the steam in [Pg127] the pipes F and G, and in\r\nthe lower part of the air-pump, a vacuum was produced in these\r\nspaces. The cock C being now closed, and the cocks L and N being\r\nopen, the steam in the upper part of the cylinder rushed through the\r\npipe E into the condenser, where it was reduced to water, so that a\r\nvacuum was left in the upper part of the cylinder. The steam from\r\nthe boiler passing below the piston, pressed it upwards with such\r\nforce, that it lifted a weight of eighteen pounds hung from the end\r\nof the piston-rod. When the piston reached the top of the cylinder,\r\nthe cocks L and N were closed, and the cock C opened. All\r\ncommunication between the cylinder and the boiler, as well as\r\nbetween the cylinder and the condenser, were now cut off, and the\r\nsteam in the cylinder circulated freely above and below the piston,\r\nby means of the open tube D. The piston, being subject to equal\r\nforces upwards and downwards, would therefore descend by its own\r\nweight, and would reach the bottom of the cylinder. The air-pump\r\npiston meanwhile being drawn up, the air and the condensed steam in\r\nthe tubes F and G were drawn into the air-pump I, through the open\r\nhorizontal tube at the bottom. Its return was stopped by the valve\r\nM. By another stroke of the air-pump, this water and air were drawn\r\nout through valves in the piston, which opened upwards. The cock C\r\nwas now closed, and the cocks L and N opened, preparatory to another\r\nstroke of the piston. The steam in the upper part of the cylinder\r\nrushed, as before, into the tubes F and G, and was condensed by\r\ntheir cold surfaces, while steam from the boiler coming through the\r\npipe S, pressed the piston upwards. The piston again ascended with\r\nthe same force as before, and in the same manner the process was\r\ncontinually repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n(72.) The quantity of steam expended in this experimental model in\r\nthe production of a given number of strokes of the piston was\r\ninferred from the quantity of water evaporated in the boiler; and\r\non comparing this with the magnitude of the cylinder and the\r\nweight raised by the pressure of the steam, the contrivance was\r\nproved to affect the economy of steam, as far as the imperfect\r\nconditions of such a model could have permitted. A larger model\r\nwas next constructed, having an outer cylinder, or steam case,\r\nsurrounding the working cylinder, and [Pg128] the experiments\r\nmade with it fully realised Watt's expectations, and left no doubt\r\nof the great advantages which would attend his invention. The\r\nweights raised by the piston proved that the vacuum in the\r\ncylinder produced by the condensation was almost perfect; and he\r\nfound that when he used water in the boiler which by long boiling\r\nhad been well cleared of air, the weight raised was not much less\r\nthan the whole amount of the pressure of the steam upon the\r\npiston. In this larger model, the cylinder was placed in the usual\r\nposition, with a working lever and other apparatus similar to that\r\nemployed in the Atmospheric Engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n(73.) It was in the beginning of the year 1765, Watt being then in\r\nthe twenty-ninth year of his age, that he arrived at these great\r\ndiscoveries. The experimental models just described, by which his\r\ninvention was first reduced to a rude practical test, were fitted\r\nup at a place called Delft House, in Glasgow. It will doubtless,\r\nat the first view, be a matter of surprise that improvements of\r\nsuch obvious importance in the economy of steam power, and capable\r\nof being verified by tests so simple, were not immediately adopted\r\nwherever atmospheric engines were used. At the time, however,\r\nreferred to, Watt was an obscure artisan, in a provincial town,\r\nnot then arrived at the celebrity to which it has since attained,\r\nand the facilities by which inventions and improvements became\r\npublic were much less than they have since become. It should also\r\nbe considered that all great and sudden advances in the useful\r\narts are necessarily opposed by the existing interests with which\r\ntheir effects are in conflict. From these causes of opposition,\r\naccompanied with the usual influence of prejudice and envy, Watt\r\nwas not exempt, and was not therefore likely suddenly to\r\nrevolutionise the arts and manufactures of the country by\r\ndisplacing the moving powers employed in them, and substituting an\r\nengine, the efficacy and power of which depended mainly on\r\nphysical principles, then altogether new and but imperfectly\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nNot having the command of capital, and finding it impracticable to\r\ninspire those who had, with the same confidence in the advantages\r\nof his invention which he himself felt, he was [Pg129] unable to\r\ntake any step towards the construction of engines on a large\r\nscale. Soon after this, he gave up his shop in Glasgow, and\r\ndevoted himself to the business of a Civil Engineer. In this\r\ncapacity he was engaged to make a survey of the river Clyde, and\r\nfurnished an elaborate and valuable Report upon its projected\r\nimprovements. He was also engaged in making a plan of the canal,\r\nby which the produce of the Monkland Colliery was intended to be\r\ncarried to Glasgow, and in superintending the execution of that\r\nwork. Besides these, several other engineering enterprises\r\noccupied his attention, among which may be mentioned, the\r\nnavigable canal across the isthmus of Crinan, afterwards completed\r\nby Rennie; improvements proposed in the ports of Ayr, Glasgow, and\r\nGreenock; the construction of the bridges at Hamilton, and at\r\nRutherglen; and the survey of the country through which the\r\ncelebrated Caledonian canal was intended to be carried.\r\n\r\n\"If, forgetful of my duties as the organ of this academy,\" says M.\r\nArago (whose eloquent observations on the delays of this great\r\ninvention, addressed to the assembled members of the National\r\nInstitute of France, we cannot forbear to quote), \"I could think\r\nof making you smile, rather than expressing useful truths, I would\r\nfind here matter for a ludicrous contrast. I would call to your\r\nrecollection the authors, who at our weekly sittings demand with\r\nall their might and main (_à cor et à cris_) an opportunity to\r\ncommunicate some little remark—some small reflection—some\r\ntrifling note, conceived and written the night before; I would\r\nrepresent them to you cursing their fate, when according to your\r\nrules, the reading of their communication is postponed to the next\r\nmeeting, although during this cruel week, they are assured that\r\ntheir important communication is deposited in our archives in a\r\nsealed packet. On the other hand, I would point out to you the\r\ncreator of a machine, destined to form an epoch in the annals of\r\nthe world, undergoing patiently and without murmur, the stupid\r\ncontempt of capitalists,—conscious of his exalted genius, yet\r\nstooping for eight years to the common labour of laying down\r\nplans, taking levels, and all the tedious calculations connected\r\nwith the routine of common engineering. While in this conduct you\r\ncannot fail to recognise the serenity, [Pg130] the moderation,\r\nand the true modesty of his character, yet such indifference,\r\nhowever noble may have been its causes, has something in it not\r\naltogether blameless. It is not without reason that society visits\r\nwith severe reprobation those who withdraw gold from circulation\r\nand hoard it in their coffers. Is he less culpable who deprives\r\nhis country, his fellow citizens, his age, of treasures a thousand\r\ntimes more precious than the produce of the mine; who keeps to\r\nhimself his immortal inventions, sources of the most noble and\r\npurest enjoyment of the mind, who abstains from conferring upon\r\nlabour those powers, by which would be multiplied in an infinite\r\nproportion the products of industry, and by which, with advantage\r\nto civilisation and human nature, he would smooth away the\r\ninequalities of the conditions of man.\"[19]\r\n\r\n\r\n(74.) Although Watt was thus attracted by pursuits foreign to his\r\nrecent investigations respecting the improvement of steam power,\r\nhe never lost sight of that object. It was not until the year\r\n1768, three years after his great discoveries, that any step was\r\ntaken to enable him to carry them into effect on a large scale. At\r\nthat time his friends brought him into communication with Dr.\r\nRoebuck, the proprietor of the Carron Iron Works, who rented\r\nextensive coal works at Kinneal from the Duchess of Hamilton. Watt\r\nwas first employed by Roebuck as a civil engineer; but when he\r\nmade known to him the improvements he had projected in the steam\r\nengine, Roebuck proposed to take out a patent for an engine on the\r\nprinciple of the model which had been fitted up at Delft House,\r\nand to join Watt in a partnership, for the construction of such\r\nengines. Sensible of the advantages to be derived from the\r\ninfluence of Roebuck, and from his command of capital, Watt agreed\r\nto cede to him two thirds of the advantages to be derived from the\r\ninvention. A patent was accordingly taken out on the fifth of\r\nJanuary, 1769, nearly four years after the invention had been\r\ncompleted; and an experimental engine on a large scale was\r\nconstructed by him, and fitted up at Kinneal House. In the first\r\ntrial this machine more than fulfilled Watt's anticipations. Its\r\n[Pg131] success was complete. In the practical details of its\r\nconstruction, however, some difficulties were still encountered,\r\nthe greatest of which consisted in packing the piston, so as to be\r\nsteam-tight. The principle of the new engine did not admit of\r\nwater being kept upon the piston, to prevent leakage, as in the\r\nold engines; he was therefore obliged to have his cylinders much\r\nmore accurately bored, and more truly cylindrical, and to try a\r\ngreat variety of soft substances for packing the piston, which\r\nwould make it steam-tight without great friction, and maintain it\r\nso in a situation perfectly dry, and at the temperature of boiling\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWhile Watt was endeavouring to overcome these and other\r\ndifficulties, in the construction of the machine, his partner, Dr.\r\nRoebuck, became embarrassed, by the failure of his undertaking in\r\nthe Borrowstowness coal and salt works; and he was unable to\r\nsupply the means of prosecuting with the necessary vigour the\r\nprojected manufacture of the new engines.\r\n\r\nThe important results of Watt's labours having happily at this\r\ntime become more publicly known, Mr. Matthew Boulton, whose\r\nestablishment at Soho, near Birmingham, was at that time the most\r\ncomplete manufactory for metal-work in England, and conducted with\r\nunexampled enterprise and spirit, proposed to purchase Dr.\r\nRoebuck's interest in the patent. This arrangement was effected in\r\nthe year 1773, and in the following year Mr. Watt removed to Soho,\r\nwhere a portion of the establishment was allotted to him, for the\r\nerection of a foundery, and other works necessary to realise his\r\ninventions on a grand scale.\r\n\r\nThe patent which had been granted in 1769 was limited to a period\r\nof fourteen years, and would consequently expire about the year\r\n1783. From the small progress which had hitherto been made in the\r\nconstruction of engines upon the new principle, and from the many\r\ndifficulties still to be encountered, and the large expenditure of\r\ncapital which must obviously be incurred before any return could\r\nbe obtained, it was apparent that unless an extension of the\r\npatent right could be obtained, Boulton and Watt could never\r\nexpect any advantage adequate to the risk of their great [Pg132]\r\nenterprise. In the year 1774 an application was accordingly made\r\nto parliament for an extension of the patent, which was supported\r\nby the testimony of Dr. Roebuck, Mr. Boulton, and others, as to\r\nthe merits and probable utility of the invention. An Act was\r\naccordingly passed, in 1775, extending the term of the patent\r\nuntil the year 1800.\r\n\r\n\r\n(75.) The following abstract of this Act may not be uninteresting\r\nat this time, when the anticipations expressed in it have been so\r\nsuccessfully and extensively realised:—\r\n\r\n\"An Act for vesting in James Watt, engineer, his executors,\r\nadministrators, and assigns, the sole use and property of certain\r\nsteam engines, commonly called fire engines, of his invention,\r\nthroughout his majesty's dominions, for a limited time:\r\n\r\n\"And whereas the said James Watt hath employed many years, and a\r\nconsiderable part of his fortune, in making experiments upon steam\r\nengines, commonly called fire engines, with a view to improve\r\nthose very useful machines, by which several very considerable\r\nadvantages over the common steam engines are acquired; but upon\r\naccount of the many difficulties which always arise in the\r\nexecution of such large and complex machines, and of the long time\r\nrequisite to make the necessary trials, he could not complete his\r\nintention before the end of the year 1774, when he finished some\r\nlarge engines as specimens of his construction, which have\r\nsucceeded, so as to demonstrate the utility of the said invention:\r\n\r\n\"And whereas, in order to manufacture these engines with the\r\nnecessary accuracy, and so that they may be sold at moderate\r\nprices, a considerable sum of money must be previously expended in\r\nerecting mills and other apparatus; and as several years and\r\nrepeated proofs will be required before any considerable part of\r\nthe public can be fully convinced of the utility of the invention,\r\nand of their interest to adopt the same, the whole term granted by\r\nthe said letters patent may probably elapse before the said James\r\nWatt can receive an advantage adequate to his labour and\r\ninvention:\r\n\r\n\"And whereas, by furnishing mechanical power at much less expense,\r\nand in more convenient forms, than has hitherto been done, his\r\nengines may be of great utility, in facilitating [Pg133] the\r\noperations in many great works and manufactures of this kingdom;\r\nyet it will not be in the power of the said James Watt to carry\r\nhis invention into that complete execution which he wishes, and so\r\nas to render the same of the highest utility to the public of\r\nwhich it is capable, unless the term granted by the said letters\r\npatent be prolonged, and his property in the said invention\r\nsecured for such time as may enable him to obtain an adequate\r\nrecompense for his labour, time, and expense:\r\n\r\n\"To the end, therefore, that the said James Watt may be enabled\r\nand encouraged to prosecute and complete his said invention, so\r\nthat the public may reap all the advantages to be derived\r\ntherefrom in their fullest extent: it is enacted,\r\n\r\n\"That from and after the passing of this Act, the sole privilege\r\nand advantage of making, constructing, and selling the said\r\nengines hereinbefore particularly described, within the kingdom of\r\nGreat Britain, and his majesty's colonies and plantations abroad,\r\nshall be, and are hereby declared to be, vested in the said James\r\nWatt, his executors, administrators, and assigns, for and during\r\nthe term of twenty-five years,\" &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n(76.) Thus protected and supported, Watt now directed the whole\r\nvigour of his mind to perfect the practical details of his\r\ninvention, and the result was, the construction on a large scale\r\nof the engine which has since been called his SINGLE ACTING STEAM\r\nENGINE.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to recollect, that notwithstanding the extensive and\r\nvarious application of steam power in the arts and manufactures, at\r\nthe time to which our narrative has now reached, the steam engine\r\nhad never been employed for any other purpose save that of raising\r\nwater by working pumps. The motion, therefore, which was required\r\nwas merely an upward force, such as was necessary to elevate the\r\npiston of a pump, loaded with the column of water which it raised.\r\nThe following then is a description of the improved engine of Watt,\r\nby which such work was proposed to be performed:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 21.]\r\n\r\nIn the cylinder represented at C (_fig._ 21.), the piston P moves\r\nsteam-tight. It is closed at the top, and the piston [Pg134] rod,\r\nbeing accurately turned, runs in a steam-tight collar, B,\r\nfurnished with a stuffing-box, and is constantly lubricated with\r\nmelted tallow. A funnel is screwed into the top of the cylinder,\r\nthrough which, by opening a stop-cock, melted [Pg135] tallow is\r\npermitted from time to time to fall upon the piston within the\r\ncylinder, so as to lubricate it, and keep it steam-tight. Two\r\nboxes, A A, called the upper and lower steam boxes, contain valves\r\nby which steam from the boiler may be admitted and withdrawn.\r\nThese steam boxes are connected by a tube of communication T, and\r\nthey communicate with the cylinder at the top and bottom by short\r\ntubes represented in the figure. The upper steam box A contains\r\none valve, by which a communication with the boiler may be opened\r\nor closed at pleasure. The lower valve box contains two valves.\r\nThe lower valve I communicates with the tube T′, leading to the\r\ncondenser D, which being opened or closed, a communication is made\r\nor cut off at pleasure, between the cylinder C and the condenser\r\nD. A second valve, or upper valve H, which is represented closed\r\nin the figure, may be opened so as to make a free communication\r\nbetween the cylinder C and the tube T, and by that means between\r\nthe cylinder C, below the piston and the space above the piston.\r\nThe condenser D is submerged in a cistern of cold water. At the\r\nside there enters it a tube, E, governed by a cock, which being\r\nopened or closed to any required extent, a jet of cold water may\r\nbe allowed to play in the condenser, and may be regulated or\r\nstopped, at pleasure. This jet, when playing, throws the water\r\nupwards in the condenser towards the mouth of the tube T′, as\r\nwater issues from the rose of a watering pot. The tube S proceeds\r\nfrom the boiler, and terminates in the steam box A, so that the\r\nsteam supplied from the boiler constantly fills that box. The\r\nvalve G is governed by levers, whose pivots are attached to the\r\nframing of the engine, and is opened or closed at pleasure, by\r\nraising or lowering the lever G′. The valve G, when open, will\r\ntherefore allow steam to pass from the boiler through the short\r\ntube to the top of the piston, and this steam will also fill the\r\ntube T. If the lower valve H be closed, its circulation beyond\r\nthat point will be stopped; but if the valve H be open, the valve\r\nI being closed, then the steam will circulate equally in the\r\ncylinder, above and below the piston. If the valve I be open, then\r\nsteam will rush through the tube T′ into the condenser; but this\r\nescape of the steam will be [Pg136] stopped, if the valve I be\r\nclosed. The valve H is worked by the lever H′, and the valve I by\r\nthe lever I′.\r\n\r\nThe valve G is called the upper steam valve, H the lower steam\r\nvalve, I the exhausting valve, and E the condensing valve.\r\n\r\nFrom the bottom of the condenser D proceeds a tube leading to the\r\nair-pump, which is also submerged in the cistern of cold water. In\r\nthis tube is a valve M, which opens outwards from the condenser\r\ntowards the air-pump. In the piston of the air-pump N is a valve\r\nwhich opens upwards. The piston-rod Q of the air-pump is attached\r\nto a beam of wood called a plug frame, which is connected with the\r\nworking beam by a flexible chain playing on the small arch-head\r\nimmediately over the air-pump. From the top of the air-pump barrel\r\nabove the piston proceeds a pipe or passage leading to a small\r\ncistern, B, called the hot well. The pipe which leads to this\r\nwell, is supplied with a valve, K, which opens outwards from the\r\nair pump barrel towards the well. From the nature of its\r\nconstruction, the valve M admits the flow of water from the\r\ncondenser towards the air-pump, but prevents its return; and, in\r\nlike manner, the valve K admits the flow of water from the upper\r\npart of the air-pump barrel into the hot well B, but obstructs its\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider how these valves should be worked in order to\r\nmove the piston upwards and downwards with the necessary force. It\r\nis in the first place necessary that all the air which fills the\r\ncylinder, the tubes and the condenser shall be expelled. To\r\naccomplish this it is only necessary to open at once the three\r\nvalves G, H, and I. The steam then rushing from the boiler through\r\nthe steam-pipe S, and the open valve G will pass into the cylinder\r\nabove the piston, will fill the tube T, pass through the lower\r\nsteam valve H, will fill the cylinder C below the piston, and will\r\npass through the open valve I into the condenser. If the valve E\r\nbe closed so that no jet shall play in the condenser, the steam\r\nrushing into it will be partially condensed by the cold surfaces\r\nto which it will be exposed; but if the boiler supply it through\r\nthe pipe S in sufficient abundance, it will rush with violence\r\nthrough the cylinder and all the passages, and its pressure in\r\nthe [Pg137] condenser D, combined with that of the heated air\r\nwith which it is mixed, will open the valve M, and it will rush\r\nthrough mixed with the air into the air-pump barrel N. It will\r\npress the valves in the air-pump piston upwards, and, opening\r\nthem, will rush through, and will collect in the air-pump barrel\r\nabove the piston. It will then, by its pressure, open the valve K,\r\nand will escape into the cistern B.\r\n\r\nThroughout this process the steam, which mixed with the air fills\r\nthe cylinder, condenser and air-pumps will be only partially\r\ncondensed in the last two, and it will escape mixed with air\r\nthrough the valve K, and this process will continue until all the\r\natmospheric air which at first filled the cylinder, tubes,\r\ncondenser and air-pump barrel shall be expelled through the valve\r\nK, and these various spaces shall be filled with pure steam. When\r\nthat has happened let us suppose all the valves closed. In closing\r\nthe valve I the flow of steam to the condenser will be stopped,\r\nand the steam contained in it will speedily be condensed by the\r\ncold surface of the condenser, so that a vacuum will be produced\r\nin the condenser, the condensed steam falling in the form of water\r\nto the bottom. In like manner, and for like reasons, a vacuum will\r\nbe produced in the air-pump. The valve M, and the valves in the\r\nair-pump piston will be closed by their own weight.\r\n\r\nBy this process, which is called _blowing through_, the\r\natmospheric air, and other permanent gases, which filled the\r\ncylinder, tubes, condenser and air-pump are expelled, and these\r\nspaces will be a vacuum. The engine is then prepared to be\r\nstarted, which is effected in the following manner:—The upper\r\nsteam valve G is opened, and steam allowed to flow from the boiler\r\nthrough the passage leading to the top of the cylinder. This steam\r\ncannot pass to the bottom of the cylinder, since the lower steam\r\nvalve H is closed. The space in the cylinder below the piston\r\nbeing therefore a vacuum, and the steam pressing above it the\r\npiston will be pressed downwards with a corresponding force. When\r\nit has arrived at the bottom of the cylinder the steam valve G\r\nmust be closed, and at the same time the valve H opened. The valve\r\nI leading to the condenser being also closed, the steam [Pg138]\r\nwhich fills the cylinder above the piston is now admitted to\r\ncirculate through the open valve H below the piston, so that the\r\npiston is pressed equally upwards and downwards by steam, and\r\nthere is no force to resist its movement save its friction with\r\nthe cylinder. The weight of the pump rods on the opposite end of\r\nthe beam being more than equivalent to overcome this the piston is\r\ndrawn to the top of the cylinder, and pushes before it the steam\r\nwhich is drawn through the tube T, and the open valve H, and\r\npasses into the cylinder C below the piston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 22.]\r\n\r\nWhen the piston has thus arrived once more at the top of the\r\ncylinder, let the valve H be closed, and at the same time the\r\nvalves G and I opened, and the condensing cock E also opened, so\r\nas to admit the jet to play in the condenser. The steam which\r\nfills the cylinder C below the piston, will now rush through the\r\nopen valve I into the condenser which has been hitherto a vacuum,\r\nand there encountering the jet, will be instantly converted into\r\nwater, and a mixture of condensed steam and injected water will\r\ncollect in the bottom of the condenser. At the same time, the\r\nsteam proceeding from the boiler by the steam pipe S to the upper\r\nsteam box A, will pass through the open steam valve G to the top\r\nof the piston, but cannot pass below it because of the lower steam\r\nvalve H being closed. The piston, thus acted upon above by the\r\npressure of the steam, and the space in the cylinder below it\r\nbeing a vacuum, its downward motion is resisted by no force but\r\nthe friction, and it is therefore driven to the bottom of the\r\ncylinder. During its descent the valves G, I, and E remained open.\r\nAt the moment it arrives at the bottom of the cylinder, all these\r\nthree valves are closed, and the valve H opened. The steam which\r\nfills the cylinder above the piston is now permitted to circulate\r\nbelow it, by the open valve H, and the piston being consequently\r\npressed equally upwards and downwards will be drawn upwards as\r\nbefore by the preponderance of the pump rods at the opposite end\r\nof the beam. The weight of these rods must also be sufficiently\r\ngreat to draw the air-pump piston N upwards. As this piston rises\r\nin the air-pump, it leaves a vacuum below it into which the water\r\nand air collected in the condenser will be drawn through the valve\r\nM, which opens outwards. When the [Pg139] air-pump piston has\r\narrived at the top of the barrel, which it will do at the same\r\ntime that the steam piston arrives at the top of the cylinder, the\r\nwater and the chief part of the air or other fluids which may have\r\nbeen in the condenser will be drawn into the barrel of the\r\nair-pump, and the valve M being closed by its own weight, assisted\r\nby the pressure of these fluids they cannot return into the\r\ncondenser. At the moment the steam piston arrives at the top of\r\nthe cylinder, the valve H is closed, and the three valves G, I,\r\nand E are opened. The effect of this change is the same as was\r\nalready described in the former case, and the piston will in the\r\nsame manner and from the same causes be driven downwards. The\r\nair-pump piston will at the same time descend by the force of its\r\nown weight, aided by the weight of the plug-frame attached to its\r\nrod. As it descends, the air below it will be gradually compressed\r\nabove the surface of the water in the bottom of the barrel, until\r\nits pressure becomes sufficiently great to open the valves in the\r\nair-pump piston. When this happens, the valves in the air-pump\r\npiston, as represented on a large scale in _fig._ 22., will be\r\nopened, and the air will pass through them above the piston. When\r\nthe piston comes in contact with the water in the bottom of the\r\nbarrel, this water will likewise pass through the open valves.\r\nWhen the piston has arrived at the bottom of the air-pump barrel,\r\nthe valves in it will be closed by the pressure of the fluids\r\nabove them. The next ascent of the steam piston will draw up the\r\nair-pump piston, and with it the fluids in the pump barrel above\r\nit. As the air-pump [Pg140] piston approaches the top of its\r\nbarrel, the air and water above it will be drawn through the valve\r\nK into the hot cistern B. The air will escape in bubbles through\r\nthe water in that cistern, and the warm water will be deposited in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the opening in the condensing valve E, must be\r\nregulated by the quantity of steam admitted to the cylinder. As\r\nmuch water ought to be supplied through the injection valve as\r\nwill be sufficient to condense the steam contained in the\r\ncylinder, and also to reduce the temperature of the water itself,\r\nwhen mixed with the steam, to a sufficiently low degree to prevent\r\nit from producing vapour of a pressure which would injuriously\r\naffect the working of the piston. It has been shown, that five and\r\na half cubic inches of ice-cold water mixed with one cubic inch of\r\nwater in the state of steam would produce six and a half cubic\r\ninches of water at the boiling temperature. If then the cylinder\r\ncontained one cubic inch of water in the state of steam, and only\r\nfive and a half cubic inches of water were admitted through the\r\ncondensing jet, supposing this water, when admitted, to be at the\r\ntemperature of 32°, then the consequence would be that six and a\r\nhalf cubic inches of water at the boiling temperature would be\r\nproduced in the condenser. Steam would immediately arise from\r\nthis, and at the same time the temperature of the remaining water\r\nwould be lowered by the amount of the latent heat taken up by the\r\nsteam so produced. This vapour would rise through the open\r\nexhausting valve I, would fill the cylinder below the piston, and\r\nwould impair the efficiency of the steam above pressing it down.\r\nThe result of the inquiries of Watt respecting the pressure of\r\nsteam at different temperatures, showed, that to give efficiency\r\nto the steam acting upon the piston it would always be necessary\r\nto reduce the temperature of the water in the condenser to 100°.\r\n\r\nLet us then see what quantity of water at the common temperature\r\nwould be necessary to produce these effects.\r\n\r\nIf the latent heat of steam be taken at 1000°, a cubic inch of\r\nwater in the state of steam may be considered for the purposes of\r\nthis computation, as equivalent to one cubic inch of water at\r\n1212°. Now the question is, how many cubic inches of water at 60°\r\nmust be mixed with this, in order that the [Pg141] mixture may\r\nhave the temperature of 100°? This will be easily computed. As the\r\ncubic inch of water at 1212° is to be reduced to 100°, it must be\r\ndeprived of 1112° of its temperature. On the other hand, as many\r\ninches of water at 60° as are to be added, must be raised in the\r\nsame mixture to the temperature of 100°, and therefore each of\r\nthese must receive 40° of temperature. The number of cubic inches\r\nof water necessary to be added will therefore be determined by\r\nfinding how often 40° are contained in 1112°. If 1112 be divided\r\nby 40, the quotient will be 27·8. Hence it appears, that to reduce\r\nthe water in the condenser to the temperature of 100°, supposing\r\nthe temperature of the water injected to be 60°, it will be\r\nnecessary to supply by the injection cock very nearly twenty-eight\r\ntimes as much water as passes through the cylinder in the state of\r\nsteam; and therefore if it be supposed that all the water\r\nevaporated in the boiler passes through the cylinder, it follows\r\nthat about twenty-eight times as much water must be thrown into\r\nthe condenser as is evaporated in the boiler.\r\n\r\nFrom these circumstances it will be evident that the cold cistern\r\nin which the condenser and air-pump are submerged, must be\r\nsupplied with a considerable quantity of water. Independently of\r\nthe quantity drawn from it by the injection valve, as just\r\nexplained, the water in the cistern itself must be kept down to a\r\ntemperature of about 60°. The interior of the condenser and\r\nair-pump being maintained by the steam condensed in them at a\r\ntemperature not less than 100°; the outer surfaces of these\r\nvessels consequently impart heat to the water in the cold cistern,\r\nand have therefore a tendency to raise the temperature of that\r\nwater. To prevent this, a pump called the _cold pump_, represented\r\nat L in _fig._ 21., is provided. By this pump water is raised from\r\nany convenient reservoir, and driven through proper tubes into the\r\ncold cistern. This cold pump is wrought by the engine, the rod\r\nbeing attached to the beam. Water being, bulk for bulk, heavier\r\nthe lower its temperature, it follows that the water supplied by\r\nthe cold pump to the cistern will have a tendency to sink to the\r\nbottom, pressing upwards the warmer water contained in it. A\r\nwaste-pipe is provided, by which this [Pg142] water is drained\r\noff, and the cistern therefore maintained at the necessary\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated, it is also evident that the hot well B,\r\ninto which the warm water is thrown by the air-pump, will receive\r\nconsiderably more water than is necessary to feed the boiler. A\r\nwaste-pipe, to carry off this, is also provided; and the quantity\r\nnecessary to feed the boiler is pumped up by a small pump, O, the\r\nrod of which is attached to the beam, as represented in _fig._\r\n21., and which is worked by the engine. The water raised by this\r\npump is conducted to a reservoir from which the boiler is fed, by\r\nmeans which will be hereafter explained.\r\n\r\nWe shall now explain the manner in which the machine is made to\r\nopen and close the valves at the proper times. By referring to the\r\nexplanation already given, it will be perceived that at the moment\r\nthe piston reaches the top of the cylinder, the upper steam valve\r\nG must be open, to admit the steam to press it down; while the\r\nexhausting valve I must be opened, to allow the steam to pass to\r\nthe condenser; and the condensing valve E must be opened, to let\r\nin the water necessary for the condensation of the steam; and at\r\nthe same time the lower steam valve H must be closed, to prevent\r\nthe passage of the steam which has been admitted through G. The\r\nvalves G, I, and E must be kept open, and the valve H kept closed,\r\nuntil the piston arrives at the bottom of the cylinder, when it\r\nwill be necessary to close all the three valves, G, I, and E, and\r\nto open the valve H, and the same effects must be produced each\r\ntime the piston arrives at the top and bottom of the cylinder. All\r\nthis is accomplished by a system of levers, which are exhibited in\r\n_fig._ 21. The pivots on which these levers play are represented\r\non the framing of the engine, and the arms of the levers G′, H′,\r\nand I′, communicating with the corresponding valves G, H, and I,\r\nare represented opposite a bar attached to the rod of the\r\nair-pump, called the _plug frame_. This bar carries certain pegs\r\nand detents, which act upon the arms of the several levers in such\r\na manner that, on the arrival of the beam at the extremities of\r\nits play upwards and downwards, the levers are so struck that the\r\nvalves are opened and closed at the proper [Pg143] times. It is\r\nneedless to explain all the details of this arrangement. Let it be\r\nsufficient, as an example of all, to explain the method of working\r\nthe upper steam valve G. When the piston reaches the top of the\r\ncylinder, a pin strikes the arm of the lever G′, and throws it\r\nupwards: this, by means of the system of levers, pulls the arm of\r\nthe valve G downwards, by which the upper steam valve is raised\r\nout of its seat, and a passage is opened from the steam pipe to\r\nthe cylinder. The valve is maintained in this state until the\r\npiston reaches the bottom of the cylinder, when the arm G′ is\r\npressed downwards, by which the arm G is pressed upwards, and the\r\nvalve restored to its seat. By similar methods the levers\r\ngoverning the other three valves, H, I, and E, are worked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 23.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 24.]\r\n\r\nThe valves used in these engines were of the kind called _spindle\r\nvalves_. They consisted of a flat circular plate of bell metal, A\r\nB, _fig._ 23., with a round spindle passing perpendicularly\r\nthrough its centre, and projecting above and below it. This valve,\r\nhaving a conical form, was fitted very exactly, by grinding into a\r\ncorresponding circular conical seat, A B C D, _fig._ 24., which\r\nforms the passage which it is the office of the valve to open and\r\nclose. When the valve falls into its seat, it fits the aperture\r\nlike a plug, so as entirely to stop it. The spindle plays in\r\nsockets or holes, one above and the other below the aperture which\r\nthe valve stops; these holes keep the valve in its proper\r\nposition, so as to cause it to drop exactly into its place.\r\n\r\nIn the experimental engine made by Mr. Watt at Kinneal, he used\r\ncocks, and sometimes sliding covers, like the regulator described\r\nin the old engines; but these he found very soon to become leaky.\r\nHe was, therefore, obliged to change them for the spindle valves\r\njust described, which, being truly [Pg144] ground, and accurately\r\nfitted in the first instance, were not so liable to go out of\r\norder. These valves are also called _puppet clacks_, or _button\r\nvalves_.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier engines constructed by Watt, the condensation was\r\nproduced by the contact of cold surfaces, without injection. The\r\nreason of rejecting the method of condensing by injection was,\r\ndoubtless, to avoid the injurious effects of the air, which would\r\nalways enter the condenser, in combination with the water of\r\ncondensation, and vitiate the vacuum. It was soon found, however,\r\nthat a condenser acting by cold surfaces without injection, being\r\nnecessarily composed of narrow pipes or passages, was liable to\r\nincrustation from bad water, by which the conducting power of the\r\nmaterial of the condenser was diminished; so that, while its outer\r\nsurface was kept cold by the water of the cold cistern, the inner\r\nsurface might, nevertheless, be so warm that a very imperfect\r\ncondensation would be produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOHO, BIRMINGHAM.]\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [19] Eloge, p. 308.\r\n\r\n[Pg145]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRMINGHAM.]\r\n\r\nCHAP.

In a letter addressed by Watt to Smeaton, dated April, 1766,\r\nWatt refers to some of these practical difficulties which he had\r\nto encounter. \"I have been,\" says he, \"tormented with exceedingly\r\nbad health, resulting from the operation of an anxious mind, the\r\nnatural consequence of staking everything [Pg146] upon the cast\r\nof a die; for in that light I look upon every project which has\r\nnot received the sanction of repeated success.\r\n\r\n\"I have made considerable alterations in our engine lately,\r\nparticularly in the condenser. That which I used at first was\r\nliable to be impaired, from incrustations from bad water;\r\ntherefore we have substituted one which works by an injection. In\r\npursuing this idea I have tried several kinds, and have at last\r\ncome to one, which I am not inclined to alter. It consists of a\r\njack-head pump, shut at bottom, with a common clack bucket, and a\r\nvalve in the cover of the pump, to discharge the air and water.\r\nThe eduction steam pipe, which comes from the cylinder,\r\ncommunicates with this pump both above and below the bucket, and\r\nhas valves to prevent anything from going back from the pump to\r\nthe eduction pipe. The bucket descends by its own weight, and is\r\nraised by the engine when the great piston descends, being hung to\r\nthe outer end of the great lever: the injection is made both into\r\nthe upper part of this pump and into the eduction pipe, and\r\noperates beyond my ideas in point of quickness and perfection.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the difficulty arising from incrustation, Watt found the\r\ntubulated condensers, and indeed all other expedients for\r\ncondensing by cold surfaces, subject to a fatal objection. They\r\ndid not condense instantaneously, and although they were capable\r\nof ultimately effecting the condensation, yet that process was not\r\ncompleted until a great part of the stroke of the piston was made.\r\nThus during more or less of the stroke the uncondensed steam\r\nresisted the piston, and robbed the moving power of a part of its\r\neffect. This objection has ever attended condensation by surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 25.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 26.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(78.) Another source of difficulty arose from the necessity of\r\nconstructing the piston and cylinder with greater precision than\r\nhad been usual in the old engines. To fit the cover to the\r\ncylinder so as to be steam-tight; to construct the piston rod so\r\nas to move through it without allowing the escape of steam, and\r\nyet at the same time without injurious friction; to connect the\r\npiston rod with the piston, so as to drive the [Pg147] latter\r\nthrough the cylinder with a perfectly straight and parallel\r\nmotion; to make such connection perfectly centrical and firm, and\r\nyet to allow the piston in its ascent to come nearly into contact\r\nwith the cover of the cylinder—were all difficulties peculiar to\r\nthe new engine. In the atmospheric engine the shank of the piston\r\nrod was rough and square, and the rod was secured to the piston by\r\ntwo or four branches or stays, as represented in _fig._ 25. It is\r\nevident that such a construction would be inadmissible in an\r\nengine in which the piston in its ascent must be brought nearly\r\ninto contact with the close cover of the cylinder. Besides this\r\nthe piston rod of an atmospheric engine might throughout its whole\r\nlength have any form which was most convenient, and required no\r\nother property than the strength necessary to work the beam. In\r\nthe new engine, on the contrary, it was necessary that it should\r\nbe accurately turned and finely polished, so as to pass through\r\nthe hole in the top of the cylinder, and be maintained in it\r\nsteam-tight. This was effected by a contrivance called a\r\n_stuffing-box_ B, represented in _fig._ 26. A hole is made in the\r\ncover of the cylinder very little greater in magnitude than the\r\ndiameter of the piston rod. Above this hole is a cup in which,\r\naround the piston, is placed a stuffing of hemp or tow, which is\r\nsaturated with oil or melted tallow. This collar of hemp is\r\npressed down by another piece, also perforated with a hole through\r\nwhich the piston rod plays, and which is screwed down on the said\r\ncollar of hemp.\r\n\r\n\r\n(79.) Although the imperfect manner in which the interior of the\r\ncylinders was then formed impaired the efficiency of the [Pg148]\r\nnew engines, yet such imperfections were not so injurious as in\r\nthe old atmospheric engines. Any imperfection of form of the inner\r\nsurface of the cylinder would necessarily cause more or less steam\r\nor air to escape between the piston and cylinder. In the improved\r\nengine this steam passing into the vacuum below the piston would\r\nrush into the condenser, and be there condensed, so that its\r\neffect in resisting the motion of the piston would necessarily be\r\ntrifling. But on the other hand, any escape of air between the\r\npiston and cylinder of an atmospheric engine would introduce an\r\nelastic fluid under the piston, which would injuriously affect the\r\naction of the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 27.]\r\n\r\nTo make the pistons move sufficiently steam-tight in these early\r\nimperfect cylinders, Watt contrived a packing formed of a collar\r\nof hemp, or tow, as represented in _fig._ 27. The bottom of the\r\npiston was formed of a circular plate of a diameter nearly, but\r\nnot altogether equal to the interior diameter of the cylinder. The\r\npart of the piston above this was considerably less in diameter,\r\nso that the piston was surrounded by a circular groove or channel\r\ntwo inches wide, into which hemp or soft rope, called _gasket_,\r\nwas run, so as to form the packing. The top of the piston was\r\nplaced over this, having a rim or projecting part, which entered\r\nthe circular groove and pressed upon the packing, the cover being\r\npressed downwards by screws passing through the piston. The lower\r\npart of the groove round the piston was rounded with a curve, so\r\nthat the pressure on the packing might force the latter against\r\nthe inner surface of the cylinder. This packing was kept supplied\r\nwith melted tallow, as already described, from the funnel, screwed\r\ninto the top of the cylinder. The metallic edges of the piston\r\nwere by this means prevented from coming into contact with the\r\nsurface of the cylinder, which was only pressed upon by the\r\nstuffing or packing projecting beyond these.\r\n\r\n\r\n(80.) Improved methods of boring soon, however, relieved [Pg149]\r\nthe engine from a part of these imperfections, and Watt writes to\r\nMr. Smeaton in the letter above quoted as follows:—\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wilkinson has improved the art of boring cylinders; so that I\r\npromise, upon a 72 inch cylinder, being not further distant from\r\nabsolute truth than the thickness of a thin sixpence in the worst\r\npart. I am labouring to improve the regulators; my scheme is to\r\nmake them acute conical valves, shut by a weight, and opened by\r\nthe force of the steam. They bid fair for success, and will be\r\ntried in a few days.\"\r\n\r\nThe person here alluded to was Mr. John Wilkinson, of Bersham near\r\nChester, who, about the year 1775, contrived a new machine for\r\naccurately boring the insides of cylinders. The cylinder being\r\nfirst obtained from the foundery with a surface as accurate as the\r\nprocess of casting would admit, had its inner surface reduced to\r\nstill greater accuracy by this machine, which consists of a\r\nstraight central bar extended along the axis of the cylinder,\r\nwhich was made to revolve slowly round it. During the operation of\r\nboring, the borer or cutter was fitted to slide along this bar,\r\nwhich being perfectly straight, served as a sort of ruler to guide\r\nthe borer or cutter in its progress through the cylinder. In this\r\nmanner the interior surface of the cylinder was rendered not only\r\ntrue and straight in its longitudinal direction, but also\r\nperfectly circular in its cross section.\r\n\r\nThe grease found to be most eligible for lubrication was the\r\ntallow of beef or mutton; but in the earlier cylinders this was\r\nsoon consumed by reason of the imperfection of the boring, and the\r\npiston being left dry ceased to be steam-tight. To prevent this,\r\nWatt sought for some substance, which while it would thicken the\r\ntallow, and detain it around the piston, would not be subject to\r\ndecomposition by heat. Black lead dust was used for this purpose,\r\nbut was soon found to wear the cylinder. In the mean while,\r\nhowever, the improved method of boring supplied cylinders which\r\nrendered this expedient unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWhen the inner surface of the cylinder is perfectly true and\r\nsmooth, the packing of the piston is soon rendered solid and hard,\r\nbeing moulded to the cylinder by working, so as to fit it\r\nperfectly. When by wear it became loose, it was [Pg150] only\r\nnecessary to tighten the screws by which the top and bottom of the\r\npiston were held together. The packing being compressed by those\r\nmeans, was forced outwards towards the surface of the cylinder, so\r\nas to be rendered steam-tight.\r\n\r\n\r\n(81.) It was not until about the year 1778, nine years after the\r\ndate of the patent, and thirteen after the invention of separate\r\ncondensation, that any impression was produced on the mining\r\ninterests by the advantages which were presented to them by these\r\nvast improvements. This long interval, however, had not elapsed\r\nwithout considerable advantage; for although all the great leading\r\nprinciples of the contrivance were invented so early as the year\r\n1765, yet the details of construction had been in a state of\r\nprogressive and continued improvement from the time Watt joined\r\nDr. Roebuck, in 1769, to the period now adverted to.\r\n\r\nThe advantages which the engine offered in the form in which it\r\nhas been just described, were numerous and important, as compared\r\neven with the most improved form of the atmospheric engine; and it\r\nshould be remembered, that that machine had also gone on\r\nprogressively improving, and was probably indebted for some of its\r\nameliorations to hints derived from the labours of Watt, and to\r\nthe adoption of such of his expedients as were applicable to this\r\nimperfect machine, and could be adopted without an infraction of\r\nhis patent.\r\n\r\nIn the most improved forms to which the atmospheric engine had\r\nthen attained, the quantity of steam wasted at each stroke of the\r\npiston was equal to the contents of the cylinder. Such engines,\r\ntherefore, consumed twice the fuel which would be requisite, if\r\nall sources of waste could have been removed. In Watt's engines,\r\nthe steam consumed at each stroke of the piston amounted only to\r\n1-1/4 times the contents of the cylinder. The waste steam,\r\ntherefore, per stroke, was only a quarter of what was usefully\r\nemployed. The absolute waste, therefore, of the best atmospheric\r\nengines was four times that of the improved engine, and\r\nconsequently the saving of fuel in the improved engines amounted\r\nto about three eighths of all the fuel consumed in atmospheric\r\nengines of the same power. [Pg151]\r\n\r\n\r\n(82.) But independently of this saving of steam, which would\r\notherwise be wasted, the power of Watt's engine, as compared with\r\nthe atmospheric engine, was so much augmented that the former\r\nwould work against a resistance of ten pounds on the square inch\r\nunder the same circumstances in which the latter would not move\r\nagainst more than seven pounds. The cause of this augmentation of\r\npower is easily explained. In the atmospheric engine the\r\ntemperature of the condensed steam could not be reduced below 152°\r\nwithout incurring a greater loss than would be compensated by the\r\nadvantage to be obtained from any higher degree of condensation.\r\nNow steam raised from water at 152° has a pressure of nearly four\r\npounds per square inch. This pressure, therefore, acted below the\r\npiston resisting the atmospheric pressure above. In Watt's engine,\r\nhowever, the condenser was kept at a temperature of about 100°, at\r\nwhich temperature steam has a pressure of less than one pound per\r\nsquare inch. A resisting force upon the piston of three pounds per\r\nsquare inch was therefore saved in Watt's engine as compared with\r\nthe atmospheric engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n(83.) Besides these direct sources of economy, there were other\r\nadvantages incidental to Watt's engine. An atmospheric engine\r\npossessed very limited power of adaptation to a varying load. The\r\nmoving power being the atmospheric pressure, was not under\r\ncontrol, and, on the other hand, was subject to variations from\r\nday to day and from hour to hour, according to the changes of the\r\nbarometer. In the first construction of such an engine, therefore,\r\nits power being necessarily adapted to the greatest load which it\r\nwould have to move, whenever the load upon its pumps was\r\ndiminished, the motion of the piston in descending would be\r\nrapidly accelerated in consequence of the moving power exceeding\r\nthe resistance. By this the machinery would be subject to sudden\r\nshocks, which were productive of rapid wear, and exposed the\r\nmachinery to the danger of fracture. To remedy this inconvenience,\r\nthe following expedient was provided in the atmospheric engine:\r\nwhenever the load on the engine was materially diminished, the\r\nquantity of water admitted through the injection valve to condense\r\nthe steam was proportionally [Pg152] diminished. An imperfect\r\ncondensation being therefore produced, vapour remained in the\r\ncylinder under the piston, the pressure of which resisted the\r\natmosphere, and mitigated the force of the machine. Besides this,\r\na cock was provided in the bottom of the cylinder, called an _air\r\ncock_, by which atmospheric air could be admitted to resist the\r\npiston whenever the motion was too rapid.\r\n\r\nThese expedients, however, were all attended with a waste of fuel\r\nin relation to the work done by the engine; for it is evident that\r\nthe consumption of steam was necessarily the same, whether the\r\nengine was working against its full load or against a reduced\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in the improved engine of Watt, when the load, to\r\nwork against which the engine exerted its full power, was\r\ndiminished, a cock or valve was provided in the steam pipe leading\r\nfrom the boiler, which was called a _throttle valve_, by adjusting\r\nwhich the passage in that pipe could be more or less contracted. By\r\nregulating this cock the supply of steam from the boiler was\r\nchecked, and the quantity transmitted to the cylinder diminished, so\r\nthat its effect upon the piston might be rendered equal to the\r\namount of the diminished resistance. By this means the quantity of\r\nsteam transmitted to the cylinder was rendered exactly proportional\r\nto the work which the engine had to perform. If, under such\r\ncircumstances, the boiler was worked to its full power, so as to\r\nproduce steam as fast as it would when the engine was working at\r\nfull power, then no saving of fuel would be effected, since the\r\nsurplus steam produced in the boiler would necessarily escape at the\r\nsafety valve. But in such case the fireman was directed to limit the\r\nfuel of the furnace until the discharge at the safety valve ceased.\r\n\r\nBy these expedients, the actual consumption of fuel in one of\r\nthese improved engines was always in the exact proportion of the\r\nwork which it performed, whether it worked at full power or at any\r\ndegree under its regular power.\r\n\r\n\r\n(84.) Notwithstanding these and other advantages attending the new\r\nengines, Boulton and Watt experienced difficulties all but\r\ninsurmountable in getting them into use. No manufactory existed in\r\nthe country possessing machinery capable of [Pg153] executing\r\nwith the necessary precision the valves and other parts which\r\nrequired exact execution, and the patentees were compelled to\r\nconstruct machinery at Soho for this purpose; and even after they\r\nsucceeded in getting the cylinders properly bored, the piston rods\r\nexactly turned and polished, the spindle valves constructed so as\r\nto be steam-tight, and every other arrangement completed which was\r\nnecessary for the efficiency of the machine, the novelty of the\r\nengine, and the difficulty which was supposed to attend its\r\nmaintenance in good working order, formed strong objections to its\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nTo remove such objections, great sacrifices were necessary on the\r\npart of Boulton and Watt; and they accordingly resolved to\r\nundertake the construction of the new engines without any profit,\r\ngiving them to the parties requiring their use at first cost, on\r\nthe condition of being remunerated by a small share of what they\r\nwould save in fuel.\r\n\r\n\"We have no objection,\" writes Mr. Boulton, \"to contract with the\r\nCarron Company to direct the making of an engine to return the\r\nwater for their mills. * * * * We do not aim at profits in engine\r\nbuilding, but shall take our profits out of the saving of fuel; so\r\nthat if we save nothing, we shall take nothing. Our terms are as\r\nfollows: we will make all the necessary plans, sections, and\r\nelevations for the building, and for the engine with its\r\nappurtenances, specifying all cast and forged iron work, and every\r\nother particular relative to the engine. We will give all\r\nnecessary directions to your workmen, which they must implicitly\r\nobey. We will execute, for a stipulated price, the valves, and all\r\nother parts which may·require exact execution, at Soho; we will\r\nsee that all the parts are put together, and set to work,\r\nproperly; we will keep our own work in repair for one year, and we\r\nhave no other objection to seven years than the inconvenience of\r\nthe distance. We will guarantee that the engine so constructed\r\nshall raise at least 20,000 cubic feet of water twenty-four feet\r\nhigh with each hundred weight of coals burnt.\r\n\r\n\"When all this is done, a fair and candid comparison shall be made\r\nbetween it, and your own engine, or any other engine in Scotland,\r\nfrom which comparison the amount of savings in fuel shall be\r\nestimated, and that amount being [Pg154] divided into three\r\nparts, we shall be entitled to one of those parts, in recompense\r\nfor our patent licence, our drawings, &c. &c. Our own share of\r\nsavings shall be estimated in money, according to the value of\r\nyour coals delivered under the boiler, and you shall annually pay\r\nus that sum, during twenty-five years from the day you begin to\r\nwork; provided you continue the use of the engine so long. And in\r\ncase you sell the engine, or remove it to any other place, you\r\nmust previously give us notice, for we shall then be entitled to\r\nour third of the savings of fuel, according to the value of coals\r\nat such new place. This is a necessary condition, otherwise the\r\nengine which we make for you at an expense of two thousand pounds\r\nmay be sold in Cornwall for ten thousand pounds.\r\n\r\n\"Such parts of the engine as we execute at Soho we will be paid\r\nfor at a fair price; I conclude, from all the observations I have\r\nhad an opportunity of making, that our engines are four times\r\nbetter than the common engines. In boilers, which are a very\r\nexpensive article, the savings will be in proportion to the\r\nsavings of coal. If you compare our engine with the common engine\r\n(not in size, but in power), you will find the original expense of\r\nerecting one to be nearly the same.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wilkinson has bored us several cylinders, almost without\r\nerror; that of fifty inches diameter, which we put up at Tipton,\r\ndoes not err the thickness of an old shilling in any part; so that\r\nyou must either improve your method of boring, or we must furnish\r\nthe cylinder to you.\"\r\n\r\nThe reluctance of mining companies to relinquish the old engines,\r\neven on these terms, led them to propose to Mr. Watt to grant them a\r\nlicence for the use of his condenser, to be applied to the\r\natmospheric engine, without the introduction of other improvements.\r\nSuch a proposition was made to him by Mr. Smeaton, in the year 1778,\r\nto which he returned the following answer:—\r\n\r\n\"I have several times considered the propriety of the application\r\nof my condensers to common engines, and have made experiments with\r\nthat view upon our engine at Soho, but have never found such\r\nresults as would induce me to try [Pg155] it any where else; and,\r\nin consequence, we refused to make that application to Wheal\r\nVirgin engines in Cornwall, and to some others; our reasons were,\r\nthat though it might have enabled them to have gone deeper with\r\ntheir present engines, yet, the savings of fuel would not have\r\nbeen great, in comparison to the complete machine. By adding\r\ncondensers to engines that were not in good order, our engine\r\nwould have been introduced into that country (which we look upon\r\nas our richest mine) in an unfavourable point of view, and without\r\nsuch profits as would have been satisfactory either to us or to\r\nthe adventurers; and if we had granted the use of condensers to\r\none, we must have done so to all, and thereby have curtailed our\r\nprofits, and perhaps injured our reputation. Besides, where a new\r\nengine is to be erected, and to be equally well executed in point\r\nof workmanship and materials, an engine of the same power cannot\r\nbe constructed materially cheaper on the old plan than on ours;\r\nfor our boiler and cylinder are much smaller, and the building,\r\nthe lever, the chains, together with all the pump and pit work,\r\nare only the same. * * * *\r\n\r\n\"We charge our profits in proportion to the saving made in fuel by\r\nour engine, when compared with a common one which burns the same\r\nkind of coals; we ask one third of these savings to be paid us\r\nannually, or half yearly; the payment being redeemable in the\r\noption of our employer, at ten years' purchase; and when the coals\r\nare low priced, we should also make some charge as engineers. In\r\nall these comparisons our own interest has made us except your\r\n(Mr. Smeaton) improved engines, unless we were allowed a greater\r\nproportion of the savings.\"\r\n\r\nTheir exertions to improve the manufacture of engines at Soho is\r\nshown by the following letter from Mr. Boulton, in the same\r\ncorrespondence to Mr. Smeaton:—\r\n\r\n\"We are systematising the business of engine making, as we have\r\ndone before in the button manufactory; we are training up workmen,\r\nand making tools and machines to form the different parts of Mr.\r\nWatt's engines with more accuracy, and at a cheaper rate than can\r\npossibly be done by the ordinary methods of working. Our workshop\r\nand apparatus will be of [Pg156] sufficient extent to execute all\r\nthe engines which are likely to be soon wanted in this country;\r\nand it will not be worth the expense for any other engineers to\r\nerect similar works, for that would be like building a mill to\r\ngrind a bushel of corn.\r\n\r\n\"I can assure you from experience, that our small engine at Soho\r\nis capable of raising 500,000 cubic feet of water 1 foot high with\r\nevery 112 lbs. of coals, and we are in hopes of doing much more.\r\nMr. Watt's engine has a very great advantage in mines, which are\r\ncontinually working deeper: suppose, for instance, that a mine is\r\n50 fathoms deep, you may have an engine which will be equal to\r\ndraining the water when the mine is worked, to 100 fathoms deep,\r\nand yet you can constantly adapt the engine to its load, whether\r\nit be 50 or 100 fathoms, or any intermediate depth; and the\r\nconsumption of coals will be less in proportion when working at\r\nthe lesser than at the greater depths; supposing it works, as our\r\nengines generally do, at 11 lbs. per square inch, when the mine\r\nbecomes 100 fathoms deep.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(85.) The great improvement which has been introduced within the\r\nlast half century, in the details of Watt's steam engine, will be\r\nrendered manifest by comparing the effects of a given weight of\r\nfuel here supplied by Mr. Boulton with the effects which the same\r\nweight of fuel is now known to produce in the best pumping engines\r\nworked in Cornwall. One of these engines, in good working order,\r\nhas been known to raise 125,000,000 lbs. 1 foot high, by the\r\ncombustion of a bushel of coals. But the average performance of\r\neven the best engines is below this amount. If we take it at\r\n90,000,000, this will be equivalent to the weight of about 1-1/2\r\nmillion cubic feet of water, a bushel of coals being 3/4 cwt. It\r\nwill therefore follow that, with the present engines, one hundred\r\nweight of coals is capable of raising about two million cubic feet\r\nof water one foot high, being a duty four times that assigned to\r\nthe early engines by Mr. Boulton.\r\n\r\n\r\n(86.) At the time that Watt, in conjunction with Dr. Roebuck,\r\nobtained the patent for his improved engine, the idea occurred to\r\nhim, that the steam which had impelled the piston in its descent\r\nrushed from the cylinder with a mechanical force much more than\r\nsufficient to overcome any resistance [Pg157] which it had to\r\nencounter in its passage to the condenser; and that such force\r\nmight be rendered available as a moving power, in addition to that\r\nalready obtained from the steam during the stroke of the piston.\r\nThis notion involved the whole principle of the expansive action\r\nof steam, which subsequently proved to be of such importance in\r\nthe performance of steam engines. Watt was, however, so much\r\nengrossed at that time, and subsequently, by the difficulties he\r\nhad to encounter in the construction of his engines, that he did\r\nnot attempt to bring this principle into operation. It was not\r\nuntil after he had organised that part of the establishment at\r\nSoho which was appropriated to the manufacture of steam engines,\r\nthat he proceeded to apply the expansive principle. Since the date\r\nof the patent which he took out for this (1782), was subsequent to\r\nthe application of the same principle by another engineer, named\r\nHornblower, it is right to state, that the claim of Mr. Watt to\r\nthis important step in the improvement of the steam engine, is\r\nestablished by a letter addressed by him to Dr. Small, of\r\nBirmingham, dated Glasgow, May, 1769:—\r\n\r\n\"I mentioned to you a method of still doubling the effect of the\r\nsteam, and that tolerably easy, by using the power of steam\r\nrushing into a vacuum, at present lost. This would do little more\r\nthan double the effect, but it would too much enlarge the vessels\r\nto use it all: it is peculiarly applicable to wheel engines, and\r\nmay supply the want of a condenser, where the force of steam only\r\nis used; for open one of the steam valves, and admit steam until\r\none fourth of the distance between it and the next valve is filled\r\nwith steam, then shut the valve, and the steam will continue to\r\nexpand, and to press round the wheel, with a diminishing power,\r\nending in one fourth of its first exertion. The sum of the series\r\nyou will find greater than one half, though only one fourth of\r\nsteam was used. The power will indeed be unequal, but this can be\r\nremedied by a fly, or by several other means.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1776 the engine, which had been then recently erected at Soho,\r\nwas adapted to act upon the principle of expansion. When the\r\npiston had been pressed down in the cylinder for a certain portion\r\nof the stroke, the further supply of steam [Pg158] from the\r\nboiler was cut off, by closing the upper steam valve, and the\r\nremainder of the stroke was accomplished by the expansive power of\r\nthe steam which had already been introduced into the cylinder.\r\n\r\n\r\n(87.) To make this method of applying the force of steam\r\nintelligible, some previous explanation of mechanical principles\r\nwill be necessary.\r\n\r\nIf a body which offers a certain resistance be urged by a certain\r\nmoving force, the motion which it will receive will depend on the\r\nrelation between the energy of the moving force and the amount of\r\nthe resistance opposed to it. If the moving force be precisely\r\nequal to the resistance, the motion which the body will receive\r\nwill be perfectly uniform.\r\n\r\nIf the energy of the moving force be greater than the resistance,\r\nthen its surplus or excess above the amount of resistance will be\r\nexpended in imparting momentum to the mass of the body moved, and\r\nthe latter will, consequently, continually acquire augmented\r\nspeed. The motion of the body will, therefore, be in this case\r\naccelerated.\r\n\r\nIf the energy of the moving force be less in amount than the\r\nresistance, then all that portion of the resistance which exceeds\r\nthe amount of the moving force will be expended in depriving the\r\nmass of the body of momentum, and the body will therefore be moved\r\nwith continually diminished speed until it be brought to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n(88.) Whenever, therefore, a uniform motion is produced in a body,\r\nit may be taken as an indication of the equality of the moving\r\nforce to the resistance; and, on the other hand, according as the\r\nspeed of the body is augmented or diminished, it may be inferred\r\nthat the energy of the moving force has been greater or less than\r\nthe resistance.\r\n\r\nIt is an error to suppose that rest is the only condition possible\r\nfor a body to assume when under the operation of two or more\r\nmechanical forces which are in equilibrium. By the laws of motion\r\nthe state of a body which is not under the operation of any\r\nexternal force must be either in a state of rest or of uniform\r\nmotion. Whichever be its state, it will suffer no change if the\r\nbody be brought under the operation of two or more forces which\r\nare in equilibrium; for to suppose [Pg159] such forces to produce\r\nany change in the state of the body, whether from rest to motion,\r\nor _vice versâ_, or in the velocity of the motion which the body\r\nmay have previously had, would be equivalent to a supposition that\r\nthe forces applied to the body being in equilibrium were capable\r\nof producing a dynamical effect, which would be a contradiction in\r\nterms. This, though not always clearly understood by mere\r\npractical men, or by persons superficially informed, is, in fact,\r\namong the fundamental principles of mechanical science.\r\n\r\n\r\n(89.) When the piston is at the top of the cylinder, and about to\r\ncommence its motion downwards, the steam acting upon it will have\r\nnot only to overcome the resistance arising from the friction of\r\nthe various parts of the engine, but will also have to put in\r\nmotion the whole mass of matter of the piston pump rods, pump\r\npistons, and the column of water in the pump barrels. Besides\r\nimparting to this mass the momentum corresponding to the velocity\r\nwith which it will be moved, it will also have to encounter the\r\nresistance due to the preponderance of the weight of the water and\r\npump rods over that of the steam piston. The pressure of steam,\r\ntherefore, upon the piston at the commencement of the stroke must,\r\nin accordance with the mechanical principles just explained, have\r\na greater force than is equal to all the resistances which it\r\nwould have to overcome, supposing the mass to be moving at a\r\nuniform velocity. The moving force, therefore, being greater than\r\nthe resistance, the mass, when put in motion, will necessarily\r\nmove with a gradually augmented speed, and the piston of the\r\nengine which has been described in the last chapter would\r\nnecessarily move from the top to the bottom of the cylinder with\r\nan accelerated motion, having at the moment of its arrival at the\r\nbottom a greater velocity than at any other part of the stroke. As\r\nthe piston and all the matter which it has put in motion must at\r\nthis point come to rest, the momentum of the moving mass must\r\nnecessarily expend itself on some part of the machinery, and would\r\nbe so much mechanical force lost. It is evident, therefore,\r\nindependently of any consideration of the expansive principle, to\r\nwhich we shall presently refer, that the action of the [Pg160]\r\nmoving power in the descent of the piston ought to be suspended\r\nbefore the arrival of the piston at the bottom of the cylinder, in\r\norder to allow the momentum of the mass which is in motion to\r\nexpend itself, and to allow the piston to come gradually to rest\r\nat the termination of the stroke.\r\n\r\nThus, if we were to suppose that after the piston had descended\r\nthrough three fourths of the whole length of the cylinder, and had\r\nacquired a certain velocity, the steam above it were suddenly\r\ncondensed, so as to leave a vacuum both above and below it, the\r\npiston, being then subject to no impelling force, would still move\r\ndownwards, in virtue of the momentum it had acquired, until the\r\nresistance would deprive it of that momentum, and bring it to\r\nrest; and if the remaining fourth part of the cylinder were\r\nnecessary for the accomplishment of this, then it is evident that\r\nthat part of the stroke would be accomplished without further\r\nexpenditure of the moving power.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this part of the stroke would be made by the expenditure\r\nof that excess of moving power, which, at the commencement of the\r\nstroke, had been employed in putting the machinery and its load in\r\nmotion, and in subsequently accelerating that motion.\r\n\r\nAlthough under such circumstances the resistance, during the\r\noperation of the moving power, shall not have been at any time\r\nequal to the moving power, since while the motion was accelerated\r\nit was less, and while retarded greater than that power, yet as\r\nthe whole moving power has been expended upon the resistance, the\r\nmechanical effect which the moving power has produced under such\r\ncircumstances will be equal to the actual amount of that power. If\r\nin an engine of this kind the steam was not cut off till the\r\nconclusion of the stroke, a part of the moving power would be lost\r\nupon those fixed points in the machinery which would sustain the\r\nshock produced by the instantaneous cessation of motion at the end\r\nof the stroke.\r\n\r\nIndependently, therefore, of any consideration of the expansive\r\nprinciple, it appears that, in an engine of this kind, the steam\r\nought to be cut off before the completion of the stroke. [Pg161]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 28.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(90.) To render the expansive action of steam intelligible, let A\r\nB (_fig._ 28.) represent a cylinder whose area we will suppose,\r\nfor the sake of illustration, to be a square foot, and whose\r\nlength, A B, shall also be a foot. If steam of a pressure equal to\r\nthe atmosphere be supplied to this cylinder, it will exert a\r\npressure of about one ton on the piston; and if such steam be\r\nuniformly supplied from the boiler, the piston will be moved from\r\nA to B with the force of one ton, and that motion will be uniform\r\nif the piston be opposed throughout the same space by a resistance\r\nequal to a ton. When the piston has arrived at B, let us suppose\r\nthat the further supply of steam from the boiler is stopped by\r\nclosing the upper steam valve, and let us also suppose the\r\ncylinder to be continued downwards so that B C shall be equal to A\r\nB, and suppose that B C has been previously in communication with\r\nthe condenser, and is therefore a vacuum. The piston at B will\r\nthen be urged with a force of one ton downwards, and as it\r\ndescends the steam above it will be diffused through an increased\r\nvolume, and will consequently acquire a diminished pressure. We\r\nshall, for the present, assume that this diminution of pressure\r\nfollows the law of elastic fluids in general; that it will be\r\ndecreased in the same proportion as the volume of the steam is\r\naugmented. While the piston, therefore, moves from B downwards it\r\nwill be urged by a continually decreasing force. Let us suppose,\r\nthat by some expedient, it is also subject to a continually\r\ndecreasing resistance, and that this resistance decreases in the\r\nsame proportion as the force which urges the piston. In that case\r\nthe motion of the piston would continue uniform. When the piston\r\nwould arrive at P′, the middle of the second cylinder, then the\r\nspace occupied by the steam being increased in the proportion of 2\r\nto 3, the pressure on the piston would be diminished in the\r\nproportion of 3 to 2, and the pressure at B being one ton, it\r\nwould be two-thirds of a ton at P′. In like manner when the piston\r\nwould arrive at C, the space occupied by the steam being double\r\nthat which [Pg162] it occupied when the piston was at B, the\r\npressure of the steam would be half its pressure at B, and\r\ntherefore at the termination of the stroke, the pressure on the\r\npiston would be half a ton.\r\n\r\nIf the space from B to C, through which the steam is here supposed\r\nto act expansively, be divided into ten equal parts, the pressure\r\non the piston at the moment of passing each of those divisions\r\nwould be calculated upon the same principle as in the cases now\r\nmentioned. After moving through the first division, the volume of\r\nthe steam would be increased in the proportion of 10 to 11, and\r\ntherefore its pressure would be diminished in the proportion of 11\r\nto 10. The pressure, therefore, driving the piston at the end of\r\nthe first of these ten divisions would be 10/11ths of a ton. In\r\nlike manner, its pressure at the second of the divisions would be\r\n10/12ths of a ton, and the third 10/13ths of a ton; and so on, as\r\nindicated in the figure.\r\n\r\nNow if the pressure of the steam through each of these divisions\r\nwere to continue uniform, and, instead of gradually diminishing,\r\nto suffer a sudden change in passing from one division to another,\r\nthen the mechanical effect produced from B to C would be obtained\r\nby taking a mean or average of the several pressures throughout\r\neach of the ten divisions. In the present case it has been\r\nsupposed that the force on the piston at B was 2240 pounds. To\r\nobtain the pressure in pounds corresponding to each of the\r\nsuccessive divisions, it will therefore only be necessary to\r\nmultiply 2240 by 10, and to divide it successively by 11, 12, 13,\r\n&c. The pressures, therefore, in pounds, at each of the ten\r\ndivisions, will be as follows:—\r\n\r\n   1st     2036·3\r\n   2d      1866·6\r\n   3d      1723·1\r\n   4th     1600·0\r\n   5th     1493·3\r\n   6th     1400·0\r\n   7th     1317·6\r\n   8th     1244·4\r\n   9th     1179·0\r\n  10th     1120·0\r\n\r\nIf the mean of these be taken by adding them together [Pg163] and\r\ndividing by 10, it will be found to be 1498 pounds. It appears,\r\ntherefore, that the pressures through each of the ten divisions\r\nbeing supposed to be uniform (which however, strictly, they are\r\nnot,) the mechanical effect of the steam from B to C would be the\r\nsame as if it acted uniformly throughout that space upon the\r\npiston with a force of about 1500 pounds, being rather less than\r\nthree-fourths of its whole effect from A to B.\r\n\r\nBut it is evident that this principle will be equally applicable\r\nif the second cylinder had any other proportion to the first. Thus\r\nit might be twice the length of the first; and in that case, a\r\nfurther mechanical effect would be obtained from the expansion of\r\nthe steam.\r\n\r\nThe more accurate method of calculating the effect of the\r\nexpansion from B to C, would involve more advanced mathematical\r\nprinciples than could properly be introduced here; but the result\r\nof such a computation would be that the actual average effect of\r\nthe steam from B to C would be equal to a uniform pressure through\r\nthat space, amounting to one thousand five hundred and forty-five\r\npounds, being greater than the result of the above computation,\r\nthe difference being due to the expansive action through each of\r\nthe ten divisions, which was omitted in the above computation.\r\n\r\n\r\n(91.) It is evident that the expansive principle, as here explained,\r\ninvolves the condition of a variation in the intensity of the moving\r\npower. Thus, if the steam act with a uniform energy on the piston so\r\nlong as its supply from the boiler continues, the moment that supply\r\nis stopped, by closing the steam valve, the steam contained in the\r\ncylinder will fill a gradually increasing volume by the motion of\r\nthe piston, and therefore will act above the piston with a gradually\r\ndecreasing energy. If the resistance to the moving power produced by\r\nthe load, friction, &c. be not subject to a variation corresponding\r\nprecisely to such variation in the moving power, then the\r\nconsequence must be that the motion imparted to the load will cease\r\nto be uniform. If the energy of the moving power at any part of the\r\nstroke be greater than the resistance, the motion produced will be\r\naccelerated; if it be less, the motion will be retarded; and if it\r\nbe at one time greater, and another [Pg164] time less, as will\r\nprobably happen, then the motion will be alternately accelerated and\r\nretarded. This variation in the speed of the body moved will not,\r\nhowever, affect the mechanical effect produced by the power,\r\nprovided that the momentum imparted to the moving mass be allowed to\r\nexpend itself at the end of the stroke, so that the piston may be\r\nbrought to rest as nearly as possible by the resistance of the load,\r\nand not by any shock on any fixed points in the machine. This is an\r\nobject which, consequently, should be aimed at with a view to the\r\neconomy of power, independently of other considerations connected\r\nwith the wear and tear of the machinery. So long as the engine is\r\nonly applied to the operation of pumping water, great regularity of\r\nmotion is not essential, and, therefore, the variation of speed\r\nwhich appears to be an almost inevitable consequence of any\r\nextensive application of the expansive principle, is of little\r\nimportance. In the patent which Watt took out for the application of\r\nthe expansive principle, he specified several methods of producing a\r\nuniform effect upon a uniform resistance, notwithstanding the\r\nvariation of the energy of the power which necessarily attended the\r\nexpansion of the steam. This he proposed to accomplish by various\r\nmechanical means, some of which had been previously applied to the\r\nequalisation of a varying power. One consisted in causing the piston\r\nto act on a lever, which should have an arm of variable length, the\r\nlength increasing in the same proportion as the energy of the moving\r\npower diminished. This was an expedient which had been already\r\napplied in mechanics for the purpose of equalising a varying power.\r\nA well-known example of it is presented in the main-spring and fuzee\r\nof a watch. According as the watch goes down, the main-spring\r\nbecomes relaxed, and its force is diminished; but, at the same time,\r\nthe chain by which it drives the fuzee acts upon a wheel or circle,\r\nhaving a diameter increased in the same proportion as the energy of\r\nthe spring is diminished.\r\n\r\nAnother expedient consisted in causing the moving power, when\r\nacting with greatest energy, to lift a weight which should be\r\nallowed to descend again, assisting the piston when the energy of\r\nthe moving force was diminished. [Pg165]\r\n\r\nAnother method consisted in causing the moving force, when acting\r\nwith greatest energy, to impart momentum to a mass of inert\r\nmatter, which should be made to restore the same force when the\r\nmoving power was more enfeebled. We shall not more than allude\r\nhere to these contrivances proposed by Watt, since their\r\napplication has never been found advantageous in cases where the\r\nexpansive principle is used.\r\n\r\n\r\n(92.) The application of the expansive principle in the engines\r\nconstructed by Boulton and Watt, was always very limited, by\r\nreason of their confining themselves to the use of steam having a\r\npressure not much exceeding that of the atmosphere. If the\r\nprinciple of expansion, as above explained, be attentively\r\nconsidered, it will be evident that the extent of its application\r\nwill mainly depend on the density and pressure of the steam\r\nadmitted from the boiler. If the density and pressure be not\r\nconsiderable when the steam is cut off, the extent of its\r\nsubsequent expansion will be proportionally limited. It was in\r\nconsequence of this, that this principle from which considerable\r\neconomy of power has been derived, was applied with much less\r\nadvantage by Mr. Watt than it has since been by others, who have\r\nadopted the use of steam of much higher pressure. In the engines\r\nof Boulton and Watt, where the expansive principle was applied,\r\nthe steam was cut off after the piston had performed from one half\r\nto two thirds of the stroke, according to the circumstances under\r\nwhich the engine was worked. The decreasing pressure produced by\r\nexpansion was, in this case, especially with the larger class of\r\nengines, little more than would be necessary to allow the momentum\r\nof the mass moved to spend itself, before the arrival of the\r\npiston at the end of the stroke.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, however, boilers producing steam of much higher\r\npressure were applied, and the steam was cut off when the piston\r\nhad performed a much smaller part of the whole stroke. The great\r\ntheatre of these experiments and improvements has been the mining\r\ndistricts in Cornwall, where, instead of working with steam of a\r\npressure not much exceeding that of the atmosphere, it has been\r\nfound advantageous to use steam whose pressure is at least four\r\ntimes as great as [Pg166] that of the atmosphere; and instead of\r\nlimiting its expansion to the last half or fourth of the stroke,\r\nit is cut off after the piston has performed one fourth part of\r\nthe stroke or less, all the remainder of the stroke being\r\naccomplished by the expansive power of the steam, and by momentum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE OVER THE CLYDE AT HAMILTON, DESIGNED BY\r\nWATT.]\r\n\r\n[Pg167]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE-ACTING ENGINE, ZINC WORKS, CITY ROAD,\r\nLONDON.]\r\n\r\nCHAP.

Since the application of the expansive action of steam\r\ninvolves the consideration of its properties when it ceases to be\r\nin contact with the water from which it was produced, and likewise\r\nthe variation of its pressure in different states of [Pg168]\r\ndensity and at different temperatures, it is necessary here to\r\nexplain some of the most important of these properties of vapour.\r\n\r\nSteam may exist in two states, distinguished from each other by\r\nthe following circumstances:—\r\n\r\n1st. It may be such that the abstraction from it of any portion of\r\nheat, however small, will cause its partial condensation.\r\n\r\n2d. It may be such as to admit of the abstraction of heat from it\r\nwithout undergoing any other change than that which air would\r\nundergo under like circumstances, viz. a diminution of temperature\r\nand pressure.\r\n\r\n\r\n(94.) We shall call, for distinction, the former _Common Steam_,\r\nand the latter _Superheated Steam_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 29.]\r\n\r\nTo explain the circumstances out of which these properties arise,\r\nlet B (_fig._ 29.) be imagined to be a vessel filled with water,\r\ncommunicating by a pipe and stopcock with another vessel A, which\r\nin the commencement of the process may be conceived to be filled\r\nwith air. Let D be a pipe and stopcock at the top of this vessel.\r\nIf the vessel B be heated, and the two cocks be opened, the steam\r\nproceeding from the water in B will blow the air out of the vessel\r\nA through the open stopcock D, in the same manner as air is blown\r\nfrom a steam engine. When the vessel A by these means has been\r\nfilled with pure steam, let both stopcocks be closed. If the steam\r\nin A, under these circumstances, have a pressure of 15 lbs. per\r\nsquare inch, its temperature will be found to be 213°. Now, if any\r\nheat be abstracted from this steam, its temperature will fall, and\r\na portion of it will be reconverted into water.\r\n\r\nAgain, suppose the vessel A to be filled with pure steam which has\r\nbeen produced from the heated water in B, the stopcock C being\r\nopen. Let the stopcock C be then closed, and the water in B be\r\nheated to a higher temperature, the temperature and pressure of\r\nthe steam in A being observed. If the stopcock C be now opened,\r\nthe steam in A will be immediately observed to rise to the more\r\nelevated temperature which has been imparted to the water in B,\r\nand at the same time it will acquire an increased pressure.\r\n[Pg169]\r\n\r\nThe increase of temperature which it has received would of itself\r\nproduce an increased pressure; but that this is not the sole cause\r\nof the augmented pressure in the present case might be proved by\r\nweighing the vessel A. It would be found to have increased weight,\r\nwhich could only arise from its having received from the water in\r\nB an additional quantity of vapour. The increased pressure\r\ntherefore, which the steam in A has acquired, is due conjointly to\r\nits increased density and its increased temperature. In general,\r\nif the water in the vessel B be raised or lowered in temperature,\r\nthe steam in the vessel A will rise and fall in temperature in a\r\ncorresponding manner, always having the same temperature as the\r\nwater in B. If the weight of the vessel A were observed, it would\r\nbe found to increase with every increase of temperature, and to\r\ndiminish with every diminution of temperature, proving that the\r\naugmented temperature of the water in B produces an augmented\r\ndensity of the steam in A. The same pressure would be found always\r\nto correspond to the same temperature and density, so that if the\r\nnumerical amount of any one of the three quantities, the\r\ntemperature, the pressure, or the density, were known, the other\r\ntwo must necessarily be determined, the same temperature always\r\ncorresponding to the same pressure, and _vice versâ_. And in like\r\nmanner, steam produced under these circumstances of the same\r\ndensity cannot have different pressures. It must be observed that\r\nthe steam here produced receives all the heat which it possesses\r\nfrom the water from which it is raised. Now it is easily\r\ndemonstrable, that this is the least quantity of heat which is\r\ncompatible with the steam maintaining the vaporous form; for if\r\nthe stopcock C be closed so as to separate the steam in A from the\r\nwater in B, and that any portion of heat, however small, be then\r\nabstracted from the steam in A, some portion of the steam will be\r\nreconverted into water.\r\n\r\nThis then, according to the definition already given, is _Common\r\nSteam_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(95.) Let us now suppose that the vessel A, being in communication\r\nwith the vessel B by the open stopcock, has been filled with pure\r\nsteam of any given temperature. The steam which it thus contains\r\nwill be common steam, and, as has been [Pg170] shown (94.), it\r\ncannot lose any portion of heat, however small, without being\r\npartially condensed; but let the stopcock C be closed, and let the\r\nsteam in A be then exposed to any source of heat by which its\r\ntemperature may be raised any required number of degrees. From the\r\nsteam thus obtained heat may be abstracted without producing any\r\ncondensation; and such abstraction of heat may be continued\r\nwithout producing condensation, until the steam is cooled down to\r\nthat temperature at which it was raised from the water in B, when\r\nthe stopcock C was opened. Any further reduction of temperature\r\nwould be attended with condensation.\r\n\r\nIf after increasing the temperature of the steam in A, the\r\nstopcock C being shut so as to render it superheated steam, its\r\npressure be observed, the pressure will be found to be increased,\r\nbut not to that amount which it would have been increased had the\r\nsteam in A been raised to the same temperature by heating the\r\nwater in B to that temperature, and keeping the stopcock open. In\r\nfact, its present augmented pressure will be due only to its\r\nincreased temperature, since its density remains unchanged. But if\r\nin these circumstances the stopcock C be suddenly opened, the\r\npressure of the steam in A will as suddenly rise to that pressure\r\nwhich in common steam corresponds to its temperature; and if the\r\nvessel A were weighed, it would be found to have increased in\r\nweight, proving that the steam contained in it has received\r\nincreased density by an increased quantity of vapour proceeding\r\nfrom the water in A. In fact, by opening the stopcock the steam\r\nwhich was before superheated steam, has become common steam. It\r\nhas the greatest density which steam of that temperature can have;\r\nand consequently, if any heat be abstracted from it, a partial\r\ncondensation will ensue.\r\n\r\nTo render these general principles more intelligible, let us\r\nsuppose that the water in B is raised to the temperature of 213°,\r\nthe stopcock C being open; the vessel A will then be filled with\r\nsteam of the same temperature, and having a pressure of 15 lbs.\r\nper square inch. This will be common steam. If the stopcock be now\r\nclosed, and the whole apparatus be exposed to the temperature of\r\n243°; the steam in A will preserve the same density, but its\r\npressure will be [Pg171] increased from 15 lbs. to a little more\r\nthan 16 lbs. per square inch. Let the stopcock C be then opened\r\nand while the temperature of the steam in A shall continue to be\r\n243°, the pressure will suddenly rise from 16 lbs. to about 26\r\nlbs. per square inch. The weight of the steam in A will be at the\r\nsame time increased in the same proportion of 16 to 26 as its\r\npressure. The steam thus produced in A will then be common steam,\r\nand any abstraction of heat from it would be attended with partial\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n(96.) The law, according to which the pressure of elastic fluids\r\nin general, whether gases or vapours, increases with their\r\ntemperature, was simultaneously discovered by Dalton and Gay\r\nLussac. If the pressure which the gas or vapour would have at the\r\ntemperature of melting ice, were expressed by 10,000, then the\r\nincrease of pressure which it would receive for every degree of\r\ntemperature by which it would be raised, its volume being supposed\r\nto be preserved, would be expressed by 208-1/3. Thus, if the\r\npressure of gas, or vapour, on a surface of a certain magnitude at\r\nthe temperature of 32° were 10,000 ounces, then the same gas or\r\nvapour would acquire an additional pressure of 208-1/3 ounces for\r\nevery degree of temperature which would be imparted to it above\r\n32°. This law is common to all gases and vapours.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that water cannot exist in the state of vapour\r\nunder the usual pressures at so low a temperature as melting ice.\r\nThis, however, does not hinder the application of the above law,\r\nfor that law will equally hold good by computing the pressure\r\nwhich the vapour would have if it were a permanent gas, and if it\r\ncould therefore exist in the elastic form at that low temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n(97.) Another law, common to all elastic fluids, and of equal\r\nimportance with the former, was discovered by Mariotte. By this\r\nlaw it appears that every gas or vapour, so long as its\r\ntemperature is unchanged, will have a pressure directly\r\nproportional to its density. If therefore, while we compress steam\r\ninto half its volume, we could preserve its temperature unaltered,\r\nwe should increase its pressure in a two-fold proportion; but if\r\nthe process of compression should cause its temperature to\r\nincrease, [Pg172] then its increase of pressure will be greater\r\nthan its increase of density, since it will be due conjointly to\r\nthe increase of density and to the increase of temperature. In\r\nthis case the increased pressure may be deduced from the combined\r\napplication of the two laws just explained; that of Mariotte will\r\ndetermine that increase of pressure which is due to the increase\r\nof density, and that of Dalton and Gay Lussac will determine the\r\nfurther increase of pressure which will be due to the increase of\r\ntemperature. The full investigation of these effects, and the\r\nformulæ expressing them, will be found in the Appendix to this\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n\r\n(98.) The fixed relations which exist between the temperatures of\r\ncommon steam and its pressure and density, have never been\r\ndiscovered from any general physical principles. The pressures and\r\nthe densities however, which correspond to a great variety of\r\ntemperatures throughout the thermometric scale, have been\r\nascertained by extensive series of experiments instituted by\r\nphilosophers of this and other countries. From a comparison of the\r\ntemperatures and pressures thus found by experiment, empirical\r\nformulæ have been constructed, which exhibit, with an approximation\r\nsufficiently close for practice, this relation; and these formulæ\r\nmay accordingly be used for the computation of tables exhibiting the\r\npressures, temperatures, and densities of common steam; and such\r\ntables will have sufficient numerical accuracy for all practical\r\npurposes. These formulæ, and the tables resulting from them, will be\r\nfound in the Appendix to this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n(99.) It has been explained, that to effect the conversion of\r\nwater into steam, it is only necessary to impart to it as much\r\nheat as, added to the temperature which it has, would, if it\r\ncontinued in the liquid form, raise it to the temperature of\r\n1212°. This condition is necessary, and sufficient to effect the\r\ntransition of water into vapour. If, for example, as much heat\r\nwere imparted to the water evaporated, as would maintain it in the\r\nliquid state to 1300°, then the steam so produced would be\r\nsuperheated steam, having 80° of heat more than is necessary to\r\nmaintain it in the vaporous form. From such steam, therefore, 80°\r\nof heat may be abstracted without producing any condensation.\r\n[Pg173]\r\n\r\n\r\n(100.) Common steam being raised from water at any pressure and\r\ntemperature, and being afterwards separated from the water, if the\r\nsame steam be compressed into a small volume, or allowed to expand\r\ninto a greater volume, it will still maintain its quality of\r\ncommon steam, and will have the same pressure and temperature,\r\nwhatever volume it may assume, as it would have if immediately\r\nraised from water at that pressure. Thus if steam be raised from\r\nwater under a pressure of 30 lbs. per square inch, and, being\r\nseparated from the water, be allowed to dilate, until its pressure\r\nis reduced to 15 lbs. per square inch, its temperature will then\r\nbe reduced to 213°, which is that temperature which it would have\r\nif immediately raised from water under a pressure of 15 lbs. per\r\nsquare inch; and if any heat be abstracted from such steam,\r\nwhether under its original pressure, or under the diminished\r\npressure of 15 lbs. per square inch, a condensation will be\r\nproduced, the amount of which will be the same, if the same\r\nquantity of heat be abstracted from the steam. These are\r\nconsequences which immediately flow from the fact, that the sum of\r\nthe latent and sensible heats of steam is always the same.[20]\r\n\r\nIt appears, therefore, that supposing the steam used in an engine\r\nto receive no additional heat after it leaves the boiler, however\r\nit may be changed in its density by subsequent expansion, it will\r\nstill retain its character of common steam, and cannot lose any\r\nportion of heat, however small, without suffering partial\r\ncondensation. The mechanical force also exerted by such steam,\r\nafter expansion, must be computed in the same manner as if it were\r\nraised immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n(101.) If the law of Mariotte were strictly applicable to steam,\r\nits mechanical effect would be the same as has been already\r\nexplained in all states of density; but since its temperature will\r\nrise and fall as its density is increased or diminished, a\r\ncorresponding change will be produced in its [Pg174] mechanical\r\nefficacy. It is therefore necessary in the calculation of the\r\nmechanical effect of steam, whether it be used at a uniform\r\npressure without the principle of expansion, or with the\r\napplication of that principle to any given extent, to take into\r\naccount the combined operation of the laws of Mariotte and Dalton.\r\nFormulæ exhibiting the relation between the temperatures,\r\npressures, volumes, and densities of steam, and the mechanical\r\neffect produced by the evaporation of water, whether acting with\r\nor without expansion, together with the tables necessary for the\r\npractical application of these, will be found in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n(102.) One of the methods of equalising the varying force of\r\nexpanding steam, would be to work it at the same time in two\r\ncylinders connected with the same beam; so that while its force in\r\none would be augmented, its force in the other would be\r\ndiminished, the combination of the two producing a uniform effect.\r\nSoon after the expansive principle was promulged by Mr. Watt, this\r\nexpedient was accordingly resorted to by an engineer named\r\nHornblower.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 30.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1781, Hornblower conceived the notion of working an\r\nengine with two cylinders of different sizes, by allowing the\r\nsteam to flow freely from the boiler until it fills the smaller\r\ncylinder, and then permitting it to expand into the greater one,\r\nemploying it thus to press down two pistons in the following\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nLet C, _fig._ 30., be the centre of the great working-beam,\r\ncarrying two arch heads, on which the chains of the piston rods\r\nplay. The distances of these arch heads from the centre C must be\r\nin the same proportion as the length of the cylinders, in order\r\nthat the same play of the beam may correspond to [Pg175] the\r\nplays of both pistons. Let F be the steam-pipe from the boiler,\r\nand G a valve to admit the steam above the lesser piston. H is a\r\ntube by which a communication may be opened by the valve I,\r\nbetween the top and bottom of the lesser cylinder B. K is a tube\r\ncommunicating by the valve L, between the bottom of the lesser\r\ncylinder B and the top of the greater cylinder A. M is a tube\r\ncommunicating, by the valve N, between the top and bottom of the\r\ngreater cylinder A; and P a tube leading to the condenser by the\r\nexhausting valve O.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the operation, suppose all the valves\r\nopened, and steam allowed to flow through the engine until the air\r\nbe completely expelled, and then let all the valves be closed. To\r\nstart the engine, let the exhausting valve O and the steam valves\r\nG and L be opened, as in _fig._ 30. The steam will flow freely\r\nfrom the boiler, and press upon the lesser piston, and at the same\r\ntime the steam below the greater piston will flow into the\r\ncondenser, leaving a vacuum in the greater cylinder. The valve L\r\nbeing opened, the steam which is under the piston in the lesser\r\ncylinder will flow through K, and press on the greater piston,\r\nwhich, having a vacuum beneath it, will consequently descend. At\r\nthe commencement of the motion, the lesser piston is as much\r\nresisted by the steam below it, as it is urged by the steam above\r\nit; but after a part of the descent has been effected, the steam\r\nbelow the piston, in the lesser cylinder, passing into the\r\ngreater, expands into an increased space, and therefore loses part\r\nof its elastic force. The steam above the lesser piston retaining\r\nits full force by having a free communication with the boiler by\r\nthe valve G, the lesser piston will be urged by a force equal to\r\nthe excess of the pressure of this steam above the diminished\r\npressure of the expanded steam below it. As the pistons descend,\r\nthe steam which is between them is continually increasing in its\r\nbulk, and therefore decreasing in its pressure, from whence it\r\nfollows, that the force which resists the lesser piston is\r\ncontinually decreasing, while that which presses it down remains\r\nthe same, and therefore the effective force which impels it must\r\nbe continually increasing. [Pg176]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the force which urges the greater piston is\r\ncontinually decreasing, since there is a vacuum below it, and the\r\nsteam which presses it is continually expanding into an increased\r\nbulk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 31.]\r\n\r\nImpelled in this way, let us suppose the pistons to have arrived\r\nat the bottoms of the cylinders, and let the valves G, L, and O,\r\nbe closed, and the valves I and N opened. No steam is allowed to\r\nflow from the boiler, G being closed, nor any allowed to pass into\r\nthe condenser, since O is closed, and all communication between\r\nthe cylinders is stopped by closing L. By opening the valve I, a\r\nfree communication is made between the top and bottom of the\r\nlesser piston through the tube H, so that the steam which presses\r\nabove the lesser piston will exert the same pressure below it, and\r\nthe piston is in a state of indifference. In the same manner the\r\nvalve N being open, a free communication is made between the top\r\nand bottom of the greater piston, and the steam circulates above\r\nand below the piston, and leaves it free to rise. A counterpoise\r\nattached to the pump-rods, in this case, draws up the piston, as\r\nin Watt's single engine; and when they arrive at the top, the\r\nvalves I and N are closed, and G, L, and O, opened, and the next\r\ndescent of the pistons is produced in the manner already\r\ndescribed, and so the process is continued.\r\n\r\nThe valves are worked by the engine itself, by means similar to\r\nsome of those already described. By computation, we find the power\r\nof this engine to be nearly the same as a similar engine on Watt's\r\nexpansive principle. It does not, however, appear, that any\r\nadequate advantage was gained by this modification of the\r\nprinciple, since no engines of this construction are now made.\r\n\r\n\r\n(103.) The use of two cylinders was revived by Arthur Woolf in 1804,\r\nwho, in this and the succeeding year, obtained patents for the\r\napplication of steam raised under a high pressure to double-cylinder\r\nengines. The specification of his patent states, that he has proved\r\nby experiment that steam raised [Pg177] under a safety-valve loaded\r\nwith any given number of pounds upon the square inch will, if\r\nallowed to expand into as many times its bulk as there are pounds of\r\npressure on the square inch, have a pressure equal to that of the\r\natmosphere. Thus, if the safety-valve be loaded with four pounds on\r\nthe square inch, the steam, after expanding into four times its\r\nbulk, will have the atmospheric pressure; if it be loaded with 5, 6,\r\nor 10 lbs. on the square inch, it will have the atmospheric pressure\r\nwhen it has expanded into 5, 6, or 10 times its bulk, and so on. It\r\nwas, however, understood in this case, that the vessel into which it\r\nwas allowed to expand should have the same temperature as the steam\r\nbefore it expands.\r\n\r\nIt is very unaccountable how a person of Mr. Woolf's experience in\r\nthe practical application of steam could be led into errors so\r\ngross as those involved in the averments of this patent; and it is\r\nstill more unaccountable how the experiments could have been\r\nconducted which led him to conclusions not only incompatible with\r\nall the established properties of elastic fluids, but even\r\ninvolving in themselves palpable contradiction and absurdity. If\r\nit were admitted that every additional pound avoirdupois which\r\nshould be placed upon the safety-valve would enable steam, by its\r\nexpansion into a proportionally enlarged space, to attain a\r\npressure equal to the atmosphere, the obvious consequence would\r\nbe, that a physical relation would subsist between the atmospheric\r\npressure and the pound avoirdupois! It is wonderful that it did\r\nnot occur to Mr. Woolf, that, granting his principle to be true at\r\nany given place, it would necessarily be false at another place,\r\nwhere the barometer would stand at a different height! Thus, if\r\nthe principle were true at the foot of a mountain, it would be\r\nfalse at the top of it; and if it were true in fair weather, it\r\nwould be false in foul weather, since these circumstances would be\r\nattended by a change in the atmospheric pressure, without making\r\nany change in the pound avoirdupois.[21]\r\n\r\n[Pg178]\r\n\r\n\r\n(104.) For several years after the extension of Watt's first\r\npatent had been obtained from parliament, he was altogether\r\nengrossed by the labour of bringing to perfection the application\r\nof the steam-engine to the drainage of mines, and in surmounting\r\nthe numerous difficulties which presented themselves to its\r\ngeneral adoption, even after its manifold advantages were\r\nestablished and admitted. When, however, these obstacles had been\r\novercome, and the works for the manufacture of engines for pumping\r\nwater, at Soho, had been organised and brought into active\r\noperation, he was relieved from the pressure of these anxieties,\r\nand was enabled to turn his attention to the far more extensive\r\nand important uses of which he had long been impressed with the\r\nconviction that the engine was capable. His sagacious mind enabled\r\nhim to perceive that the machine he had created was an infant\r\nforce, which by the fostering influence of his own genius would\r\none day extend its vast power over the arts and manufactures, the\r\ncommerce and the civilisation of the world. Filled with such\r\naspirations, he addressed his attention about the year 1779, to\r\nthe adaptation of the steam-engine to move machinery, and thereby\r\nto supersede animal power, and the natural agents, wind and water.\r\n\r\nThe idea that steam was capable of being applied extensively as a\r\nprime mover, had prevailed from a very early period; and now that\r\nwe have seen its powers so extensively brought to bear, it will\r\nnot be uninteresting to revert to the faint traces by which its\r\nagency was sketched in the crude speculations of the early\r\nmechanical inventors.\r\n\r\n\r\n(105.) Papin, to whom the credit of discovering the method of\r\nproducing a vacuum by the condensation of steam is due, was the\r\nearliest and most remarkable of those projectors. With very limited\r\npowers of practical application, he was, nevertheless, peculiarly\r\nhappy in his mechanical conceptions; and had his experience and\r\nopportunities been proportionate to the clearsighted character of\r\nhis mind, he would doubtless have anticipated some of the most\r\nmemorable of his successors in the progressive improvement of the\r\nsteam engine.\r\n\r\nIn his work already cited, after describing his method of\r\nimparting an alternate motion to a piston by the atmospheric\r\n[Pg179] pressure acting against a vacuum produced by the\r\ncondensation of steam, he stated that his invention, besides being\r\napplicable to pumping water, could be available for rowing vessels\r\nagainst wind and tide, which he proposed to accomplish in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\nPaddle-wheels, such as have since been brought into general use,\r\nwere to be placed at the sides, and attached to a shaft extending\r\nacross the vessel. Within the vessel, and under this shaft, he\r\nproposed to place several cylinders supplied with pistons, to be\r\nworked by the atmospheric pressure. On the piston-rods were to be\r\nconstructed racks furnished with teeth: these teeth were to work in\r\nthe teeth of wheels or pinions, placed on the shaft of the\r\npaddle-wheels. These pinions were not to be fixed on the shaft, but\r\nto be connected with it by a ratchet; so that when they turned in\r\none direction, they would revolve without causing the shaft to\r\nrevolve; but when driven in the other direction, the catch of the\r\nratchet-wheel would act upon the shaft so as to compel the shaft and\r\npaddle-wheels to revolve with the motion of the pinion or wheel upon\r\nit. By this arrangement, whenever the piston of any cylinder was\r\nforced down by the atmospheric pressure, the rack descending would\r\ncause the corresponding pinion of the paddle-shaft to revolve; and\r\nthe catch of the ratchet wheel, being thus in operation, would cause\r\nthe paddle-shaft and paddle-wheels also to revolve; but whenever the\r\npiston would rise, the rack driving the pinion in the opposite\r\ndirection, the catch of the ratchet wheel would merely fall from\r\ntooth to tooth, without driving the paddle-shaft.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that by such an arrangement a single cylinder and\r\npiston would give an intermitting motion to the paddle-shaft, the\r\nmotion of the wheel being continued only during the descent of the\r\npiston; but if several cylinders were provided, then their motion\r\nmight be so managed, that when one would be performing its\r\nascending stroke, and therefore giving no motion to the\r\npaddle-shaft, another should be performing its descending stroke,\r\nand therefore driving the paddle-shaft. As the interval between\r\nthe arrival of the piston at the bottom of the cylinder and the\r\ncommencement [Pg180] of its next descent would have been, in the\r\nimperfect machine conceived by Papin, much longer than the time of\r\nthe descent, it was evident that more than two cylinders would be\r\nnecessary to insure a constantly acting force on the paddle-shaft,\r\nand, accordingly, Papin proposed to use several cylinders.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, Papin proposed to construct a boiler having a\r\nfireplace surrounded on every side by water, so that the heat\r\nmight be imparted to the water with such increased rapidity as to\r\nenable the piston to make four strokes per minute. These projects\r\nwere promulged in 1690, but it does not appear that they were ever\r\nreduced to experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n(106.) Savery proposed, in his original patent, in 1698, to apply\r\nhis steam engine as a general prime mover for all sorts of\r\nmachinery, by causing it to raise water to make an artificial\r\nfall, by which overshot water-wheels might be driven. This\r\nproposal was not acted on during the lifetime of Savery, but it\r\nwas at a subsequent period partially carried into effect. Mr.\r\nJoshua Rigley erected several steam engines on this principle at\r\nManchester, and other parts of Lancashire, to impel the machinery\r\nof some of the earliest manufactories and cotton mills in that\r\ndistrict. The engines usually raised the water from sixteen to\r\ntwenty feet high, from whence it was conveyed to an overshot\r\nwheel, to which it gave motion. The same water was repeatedly\r\nelevated by the engine, so that no other supply was necessary,\r\nsave what was sufficient to make good the waste. These engines\r\ncontinued in use for some years, until superseded by improved\r\nmachines.[22]\r\n\r\n\r\n(107.) In 1736, Jonathan Hulls obtained a patent for a method of\r\ntowing ships into or out of harbour against wind and tide. This\r\nmethod was little more than a revival of that proposed by Papin in\r\n1690. The motion, however, was to be communicated to the\r\npaddle-shaft by a rope passing over a pulley fixed on an axis, and\r\nwas to be maintained during the returning stroke of the piston by\r\nthe descent of a weight which was elevated during the descending\r\nstroke. There is no record, however, of this plan, any more than\r\nthat of Papin, ever having been reduced to experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n(108.) During the early part of the last century the [Pg181]\r\nmanufactures of this country had not attained to such an extent as\r\nto render the moving power supplied by water insufficient or\r\nuncertain to any inconvenient degree; and accordingly mills, and\r\nother works in which machinery required to be driven by a moving\r\npower, were usually built along the streams of rivers. About the\r\nyear 1750 the general extension of manufactures, and their\r\nestablishment in localities where water power was not accessible,\r\ncalled the steam engine into more extensive operation. In the year\r\n1752, Mr. Champion, of Bristol, applied the atmospheric engine to\r\nraise water, by which a number of overshot wheels were driven.\r\nThese were applied to move extensive brass-works in that\r\nneighbourhood, and this application was continued for about twenty\r\nyears, but ultimately given up on account of the expense of fuel\r\nand the improved applications of the steam engine.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Smeaton applied himself with great activity and\r\nsuccess to the improvement of wind and water mills, and succeeded\r\nin augmenting their useful effect in a twofold proportion with the\r\nsame supply of water. From the year 1750 until the year 1780 he\r\nwas engaged in the construction of his improved water mills, which\r\nhe erected in various parts of the country, and which were\r\nimitated so extensively that the improvement of such mills became\r\ngeneral. In cases where a summer drought suspended the supply of\r\nwater, horse machinery was provided, either to work the mill or to\r\nthrow back the water. These improvements necessarily obstructed\r\nfor a time the extension of steam power to mill work; but the\r\nincrease of manufactures soon created a demand for power greatly\r\nexceeding what could be supplied by such limited means.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of iron, it is of great importance to keep the\r\nfurnaces continually blown, so that the heat may never be abated\r\nby day or night. In the extensive ironworks at Colebrook Dale,\r\nseveral water-wheels were used in the different operations of the\r\nmanufacture of iron, especially in driving the blowers of the iron\r\nfurnaces. These wheels were usually driven by the water of a\r\nriver, but in the summer months the supply became so short that it\r\nwas insufficient to work them all. Steam engines were accordingly\r\nerected to [Pg182] return the water for driving these wheels.\r\nThis application of the engine as an occasional power for the\r\nsupply of water-wheels having been found so effectual, returning\r\nengines were soon adopted as the permanent and regular means of\r\nsupplying water-wheels. The first attempt of this kind is recorded\r\nto have been made by Mr. Oxley, in 1762, who constructed a machine\r\nto draw coals out of a pit at Hartley colliery, in Northumberland.\r\nIt was originally intended to turn the machine by a continuous\r\ncircular motion received from the beam of the engine; but that\r\nmethod not being successful, the engine was applied to raise water\r\nfor a wheel by which the machine was worked. This engine was\r\ncontinued in use for several years, and though it was at length\r\nabandoned, on account of its defective construction, it\r\nnevertheless established the practicability of using steam power\r\nas a means of driving water wheels.[23]\r\n\r\n\r\n(109.) In the year 1777, Mr. John Stewart read a paper before the\r\nRoyal Society, describing a method for obtaining a continued\r\ncircular motion for turning all kinds of mills from the\r\nreciprocating motion of a steam engine. He proposed to accomplish\r\nthis by means of two endless chains passing over pulleys, which\r\nshould be moved upwards and downwards by the motion of the engine,\r\nin the manner of a window sash. The joint pins of the links of the\r\ntwo chains worked in teeth at the opposite sides of a cog wheel,\r\nto which they imparted a circular motion, first by one chain, and\r\nthen by the other, acting alternately on opposite sides of the\r\nwheel. One chain impelled it during the descent of the piston, and\r\nthe other during the ascent; but one of these chains always passed\r\nover its pulleys so as to produce no effect on one side of the cog\r\nwheel, whilst the other chain worked on the opposite side to turn\r\nit round. For this purpose each chain was provided with a catch,\r\nto prevent its circulating over its pulleys in one direction, but\r\nto allow it free motion in the other. The cog wheel thus kept in\r\nrevolution might be applied to the axis of any mill which the\r\nengine was required to work. Thus, if it were applied to a\r\nflour-mill, the millstone itself would perform the office of a\r\nfly-wheel to regulate the intermission of [Pg183] the power, and\r\nin other mills a fly-wheel might be added for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe hints obtained by Mr. Stewart from Papin's contrivance, before\r\nmentioned, will not fail to be perceived. In Mr. Stewart's paper\r\nhe notices indirectly the method of obtaining a continued circular\r\nmotion from a reciprocating motion by means of a crank or winch,\r\nwhich, he says, occurs naturally in theory, but in practice would\r\nbe impossible, from the nature of the motion of the engine, which\r\ndepends on the force of the steam, and cannot be ascertained in\r\nits length. Therefore, on the first variation, the machine would\r\nbe either broken in pieces or turned back. Such an opinion,\r\npronounced by a man of considerable mechanical knowledge and\r\ningenuity, against a contrivance which, as will presently appear,\r\nproved in practice, not less than in theory, to be the most\r\neffectual means of accomplishing the end here pronounced to be\r\nimpossible, is sufficiently remarkable. It might cast some doubt\r\non the extent of Mr. Stewart's practical knowledge, if it did not\r\nhappen to be in accordance with a judgment so generally\r\nunimpeachable as that of Mr. Smeaton. This paper of Mr. Stewart's\r\nwas referred by the council of the Royal Society to Mr. Smeaton,\r\nwho remarked upon the difficulty arising from the absolute\r\nstopping of the whole mass of moving power, whenever the direction\r\nof the motion is changed; and observed, that although a fly-wheel\r\nmight be applied to regulate the motion, it must be such a large\r\none as would not be readily controlled by the engine itself; and\r\nhe considered that the use of such a fly-wheel would be a greater\r\nincumbrance to a mill than a water-wheel to be supplied by water\r\npumped up by the engine. This engineer, illustrious as he was, not\r\nonly fell into the error of Mr. Stewart in respect of the crank,\r\nbut committed the further blunder of condemning the very expedient\r\nwhich has since rendered the crank effectual. It will presently\r\nappear that the combination of the crank and fly-wheel have been\r\nthe chief means of establishing the dominion of the steam engine\r\nover manufactures.\r\n\r\n\r\n(110.) In 1779, Mr. Matthew Wasbrough, an engineer at Bristol,\r\ntook out a patent for the application of a steam engine [Pg184]\r\nto produce a continuous circular motion by means of ratchet\r\nwheels, similar to those previously used by Mr. Oxley, at Hartley\r\ncolliery; to which, however, Mr. Wasbrough added a fly-wheel to\r\nmaintain and regulate the motion. Several machines were\r\nconstructed under this patent; and among others, one was erected\r\nat Mr. Taylor's saw-mills and block manufactory at Southampton. In\r\n1780, one was erected at Birmingham, where the ratchet work was\r\nfound to be subject to such objections, that one of the persons\r\nabout the works substituted for it the simple crank, which has\r\nsince been invariably used. A patent was taken out for this\r\napplication of the crank in the same year, by Mr. James Pickard,\r\nof Birmingham. It will presently appear, however, that the\r\nsuggestion of this application of the crank was derived from the\r\nproceedings of Watt, who was at the same time engaged in similar\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n(111.) The single-acting steam engine, as constructed by Watt, was\r\nnot adapted to produce continuous uniform motion of rotation, for\r\nthe following reasons:—\r\n\r\n_First._ The effect required was that of an uniformly acting\r\nforce. The steam engine, on the other hand, supplied an\r\nintermitting force. Its operation was continued during the\r\ndescending motion of the piston, but it was suspended during the\r\nascent of the piston. To produce the continued effect now\r\nrequired, either its principle of operation should be altered, or\r\nsome expedient should be devised for maintaining the motion of the\r\nrevolving shaft during the ascent of the piston, and the\r\nconsequent suspension of the moving power.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ The action of the steam engine was rectilinear. It was\r\na power which acted in a straight line, viz., in the direction of\r\nthe cylinder. The motion, however, required to be produced, was a\r\ncircular motion—a motion of rotation around the axis or shaft of\r\nthe mill.\r\n\r\nThe steps by which Watt proceeded to accomplish these objects have\r\nbeen recorded by himself as follows, in his notes upon Dr.\r\nRobison's article on the steam engine:—\r\n\r\n\"I had very early turned my mind to the producing of continued\r\nmotion round an axis; and it will be seen, by reference to my\r\nfirst specification in 1769, that I there described [Pg185] a\r\nsteam wheel, moved by the force of steam, acting in a circular\r\nchannel against a valve on one side, and against a column of\r\nmercury, or some other fluid metal, on the other side. This was\r\nexecuted upon a scale of about six feet diameter at Soho, and\r\nworked repeatedly, but was given up, as several practical\r\nobjections were found to operate against it; similar objections\r\nlay against other rotative engines, which had been contrived by\r\nmyself and others, as well as to the engines producing rotatory\r\nmotions by means of ratchet wheels.\r\n\r\n\"Having made my single reciprocating engines very regular in their\r\nmovements, I considered how to produce rotative motions from them\r\nin the best manner; and amongst various schemes which were\r\nsubjected to trial, or which passed through my mind, none appeared\r\nso likely to answer the purpose as the application of the crank,\r\nin the manner of the common turning lathe; but as the rotative\r\nmotion is produced in that machine by impulse given to the crank\r\nin the descent of the foot only, it requires to be continued in\r\nits ascent by the energy of the wheel, which acts as a fly; being\r\nunwilling to load my engine with a fly-wheel heavy enough to\r\ncontinue the motion during the ascent of the piston (or with a\r\nfly-wheel heavy enough to equalise the motion, even if a\r\ncounterweight were employed to act during that ascent), I proposed\r\nto employ two engines, acting upon two cranks fixed on the same\r\naxis, at an angle of 120° to one another, and a weight placed upon\r\nthe circumference of the fly-wheel at the same angle to each of\r\nthe cranks, by which means the motion might be rendered nearly\r\nequal, and only a very light fly-wheel would be requisite.\r\n\r\n\"This had occurred to me very early; but my attention being fully\r\nemployed in making and erecting engines for raising water, it\r\nremained _in petto_ until about the year 1778 or 1789, when Mr.\r\nWasbrough erected one of his ratchet-wheel engines at Birmingham,\r\nthe frequent breakages and irregularities of which recalled the\r\nsubject to my mind, and I proceeded to make a model of my method,\r\nwhich answered my expectations; but having neglected to take out a\r\npatent, the invention was communicated by a workman employed\r\nto [Pg186] make the model, to some of the people about Mr.\r\nWasbrough's engine, and a patent was taken out by them for the\r\napplication of the crank to steam engines. This fact the said\r\nworkman confessed, and the engineer who directed the works\r\nacknowledged it; but said, nevertheless, that the same idea had\r\noccurred to him prior to his hearing of mine, and that he had even\r\nmade a model of it before that time; which might be a fact, as the\r\napplication to a single crank was sufficiently obvious.\r\n\r\n\"In these circumstances, I thought it better to endeavour to\r\naccomplish the same end by other means, than to enter into\r\nlitigation; and if successful, by demolishing the patent, to lay\r\nthe matter open to every body. Accordingly, in 1781, I invented\r\nand took out a patent for several methods of producing rotative\r\nmotions from reciprocating ones; amongst which was the method of\r\nthe sun-and-planet wheels. This contrivance was applied to many\r\nengines, and possesses the great advantage of giving a double\r\nvelocity to the fly-wheel; but is perhaps more subject to wear,\r\nand to be broken under great strains, than a simple crank, which\r\nis now more commonly used, although it requires a fly-wheel of\r\nfour times the weight, if fixed upon the first axis; my\r\napplication of the double engine to these rotative machines\r\nrendered the counterweight unnecessary, and produced a more\r\nregular motion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(112.) Watt's second patent here referred to, was dated 25th\r\nOctober, 1781, and was entitled \"A patent for certain new methods\r\nof applying the vibrating or reciprocating motions of steam or\r\nfire engines to produce a continued rotative or circular motion\r\nround an axis or centre, and thereby to give motion to the wheels\r\nof mills and other machines.\"\r\n\r\nAll the methods specified in this patent were intended to be\r\nworked by the single-acting engine, already described, a\r\ncounterweight being applied to impel the machinery during the\r\nreturning stroke of the engine, which weight would be elevated\r\nduring the descent of the piston. There were five different\r\nexpedients proposed in the specification for producing a rotatory\r\nmotion; but, of these five, two only were ever applied in\r\npractice. [Pg187]\r\n\r\n\r\n(113.) Suppose a rod or bar attached by a pin or joint at the\r\nupper extremity to the working end of the beam of the engine, and\r\nby a similar pin or joint at the lower extremity to an iron wheel\r\nfixed on the extremity of the axis of the fly-wheel. One half of\r\nthis wheel is formed of a solid semicircle of cast iron, while the\r\nother half is constructed of open spokes, so as to be as light as\r\nis consistent with strength. The position of the wheel on the axis\r\nis such that during the returning stroke of the piston, when the\r\noperation of the steam is suspended, the heavy semicircle of the\r\nwheel will be descending, and by its weight will draw down the\r\nconnecting bar, and thereby draw down the working end of the beam,\r\nand draw up the piston in the cylinder. When the piston descends\r\nand is driven by the power of the steam, the heavy semicircle of\r\nthe above-mentioned wheel will be drawn upwards, and in the same\r\nway the motion will be continued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 32.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(114.) The second method of producing a rotatory motion, which was\r\nsubsequently continued for many years in practical operation, was\r\nthat which was called the _Sun-and-planet Wheels_. A toothed wheel\r\nA (_fig._ 32.), called the sun wheel, was fixed on the axle of the\r\nfly-wheel, to which rotation was to be imparted. The wheel B,\r\ncalled the planet wheel, having an equal diameter, was fastened on\r\nthe end I of the connecting rod H I, so as to be incapable of\r\nrevolving. During the descent of the piston, the working end of\r\nthe beam was drawn upwards, and the end I of the connecting rod\r\ntravelled from C to D, through the dotted semicircle C I D. The\r\nwheel B not being capable of revolving on the centre I, would,\r\nduring this motion, drive the sun wheel A. During the ascent of\r\nthe steam piston, the working end of the beam would descend, and\r\nthe centre I of [Pg188] the planet wheel B would be driven\r\ndownwards from D to C, through the other dotted semicircle, and\r\nwould consequently continue to drive the sun wheel round in the\r\nsame direction.\r\n\r\nThis contrivance, although in the main inferior to the more simple\r\none of the crank, is not without some advantages; among others, it\r\ngives to the sun wheel double the velocity which would be\r\ncommunicated by the crank; for in the crank one revolution only on\r\nthe axle is produced by one revolution of the crank, but in the\r\nsun-and-planet wheel, two revolutions of the sun wheel are\r\nproduced by one of the planet wheel; thus a double velocity is\r\nobtained from the same motion of the beam. This will be evident\r\nfrom considering that when the planet wheel is in its highest\r\nposition, its lowest tooth is engaged with the highest tooth of\r\nthe sun wheel; as the planet wheel passes from the highest\r\nposition, its teeth drive those of the sun wheel before them, and\r\nwhen it comes into the lowest position, the highest tooth of the\r\nplanet wheel is engaged with the lowest of the sun wheel: but then\r\nhalf of the sun wheel has _rolled off_ the planet wheel, and,\r\ntherefore, the tooth which was engaged with it in its highest\r\nposition, must now be distant from it by half the circumference of\r\nthe wheel, and must, therefore, be again in the highest position;\r\nso that while the planet wheel has been carried from the top to\r\nthe bottom, the sun wheel has made a complete revolution.\r\n\r\nThis advantage of giving an increased velocity may be obtained\r\nalso by the crank, by placing toothed wheels on its axle.\r\nIndependently of the greater expense attending the construction of\r\nthe sun-and-planet wheel, its liability to go out of order, and\r\nthe rapid wear of the teeth, and other objections, rendered it\r\ninferior to the crank, which has entirely superseded it.\r\n\r\n\r\n(115.) Although by these contrivances Watt succeeded in obtaining\r\na continuous circular motion from the reciprocating motion of\r\nthe steam engine, the machine was still one of intermitting,\r\ninstead of continuous action. The expedient of a counterweight,\r\nelevated during the descending stroke, and giving back the power\r\nexpended on it in the interval of the returning stroke, did not\r\nsatisfy the [Pg189] fastidious mechanical taste of Watt. He\r\nsoon perceived that all which he proposed to accomplish by the\r\napplication of two cylinders and pistons working alternately,\r\ncould be attained with greater simplicity and effect by a single\r\ncylinder, if he could devise means by which the piston might be\r\nimpelled by steam upwards as well as downwards. To accomplish\r\nthis, it was only necessary to throw the lower end of the cylinder\r\ninto alternate communication with the boiler, while the upper end\r\nwould be put into communication with the condenser. If, for\r\nexample, during the descent of the piston, the upper end of the\r\ncylinder communicated with the boiler, and the lower end with the\r\ncondenser; and, on the other hand, during the ascent of the\r\npiston, the lower end communicated with the boiler, and the upper\r\nend with the condenser; then the piston would be driven\r\ncontinually, whether upwards or downwards, by the power of steam\r\nacting against a vacuum. Watt obtained his third patent for this\r\ncontrivance, on the 12th of March, 1782.\r\n\r\nThis change in the principle of the machine involved several other\r\nchanges in the details of its mechanism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 33.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(116.) It was necessary, in the first place, to provide means for\r\nadmitting and withdrawing the steam at either end of the cylinder.\r\nFor this purpose let B and B′ (_fig._ 33.) be two steam-boxes, B\r\nthe upper, and B′ the lower, communicating respectively with the\r\ntop and bottom of the cylinder by proper passages D D′. Let two\r\nvalves be placed in B, one, S, above the passage D, and the other,\r\nC, below it; and in like manner two other valves in the lower\r\nvalve-box, B′, one, S′, above the passage D′, and the other, C′,\r\nbelow it. Above the valve S in the upper steam-box is an opening\r\nat which the steam-pipe from the boiler enters, and below the\r\nvalve C is another opening, at which enters the exhausting-pipe\r\nleading to the condenser. In like manner, above the valve S′ in\r\nthe lower steam-box enters a steam-pipe leading from the boiler,\r\nand below the valve C′ enters an exhausting-pipe leading to\r\n[Pg190] the condenser. It is evident, therefore, that steam can\r\nalways be admitted above the piston by opening the valve S, and\r\nbelow it by opening the valve S′; and, in like manner, steam can\r\nbe withdrawn from the cylinder above the piston, and allowed to\r\npass to the condenser, by opening the valve C, and from below it\r\nby opening the valve C′.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 34.]\r\n\r\nSupposing the piston P to be at the top of the cylinder, and the\r\ncylinder below the piston to be filled with pure steam, let the\r\nvalves S and C′ be opened, the valves C and S′ being closed as\r\nrepresented in _fig._ 34. Steam from the boiler will, therefore,\r\nflow in through the open valve S, and will press the piston\r\ndownwards, while the steam that has filled the cylinder below the\r\npiston will pass through the open valve C′ into the exhausting-pipe\r\nleading to the condenser, and being condensed will leave the\r\ncylinder below the piston a vacuum. The piston will, therefore, be\r\npressed downwards by the action of the steam above it, as in the\r\nsingle-acting engine. Having arrived at the bottom of the cylinder,\r\nlet the valves S and C′ be both closed, and the valves S′ and C be\r\nopened, as represented in _fig._ 34. Steam will now be admitted\r\nthrough the open valve S′ and through the passage D′ below the\r\npiston, while the steam which has just driven the piston downwards,\r\nfilling the cylinder above the piston, will be drawn off through the\r\nopen valve C, and the exhausting-pipe, into the condenser, leaving\r\nthe cylinder above the piston a vacuum. The piston will, therefore,\r\nbe pressed upwards by the action of the steam below it, against the\r\nvacuum above it, and will ascend with the same force as that with\r\nwhich it had descended.\r\n\r\nThis alternate action of the piston upwards and downwards may\r\nevidently be continued by opening and closing the valves alternately\r\nin pairs. Whenever the piston is at the top of the cylinder, as\r\nrepresented in _fig._ 33., the valves S and C′, that is, the upper\r\nsteam-valve and the lower exhausting-valve, are opened, and the\r\nvalves C and S′, that is, the upper exhausting-valve and the lower\r\nsteam-valve, are closed; and [Pg191] when the piston has arrived at\r\nthe bottom of the cylinder, as represented in _fig._ 34., the valves\r\nC and S′, that is, the upper exhausting-valve and the lower\r\nsteam-valve, are opened, and the valves S and C′, that is, the upper\r\nsteam-valve and the lower exhausting-valve, are closed.\r\n\r\nIf these valves, as has been here supposed, be opened and closed\r\nat the moments at which the piston reaches the top and bottom of\r\nthe cylinder, it is evident that they may be all worked by a\r\nsingle lever connected with them by proper mechanism. When the\r\npiston arrives at the top of the cylinder, this lever would be\r\nmade to open the valves S and C′, and at the same time to close\r\nthe valves S′ and C; and when it arrives at the bottom of the\r\ncylinder, it would be made to close the valves S and C′, and to\r\nopen the valves S′ and C.\r\n\r\nIf, however, it be desired to cut off the steam before the arrival\r\nof the piston at the termination of its stroke, whether upwards or\r\ndownwards, then the steam-valves must be closed before the arrival\r\nof the piston at the end of its stroke; and as the exhausting-valve\r\nought to be left open until the stroke is completed, these valves\r\nought to be moved at different times. In that case separate levers\r\nshould be provided for the different valves. We shall, however,\r\nreturn again to the subject of the valves which regulate the\r\nadmission of steam to the cylinder and its escape to the condenser.\r\n\r\n\r\n(117.) It will be remembered that in the single-acting engine the\r\nprocess of condensation was suspended while the piston ascended in\r\nthe cylinder, and therefore the play of the jet of cold water in the\r\ncondenser was stopped during this interval. In the double-acting\r\nengine, however, the flow of steam from the cylinder to the\r\ncondenser is continued, whether the piston ascends or descends, and\r\ntherefore a constant condensation of steam must be produced. The\r\ncondensing jet, therefore, does not in this case, as in the former,\r\nplay with intervals of intermission. A constant jet of cold water\r\nmust be maintained in the condenser.\r\n\r\nIt will presently appear that in the double-acting engine applied\r\nto manufactures, the motion of the piston was subject to more or\r\nless variation of speed, and the quantity of steam [Pg192]\r\nadmitted to the cylinder was subject to a corresponding change.\r\nThe quantity of steam, therefore, drawn into the condenser was\r\nsubject to variation, and required a considerable change in the\r\nquantity of cold water admitted through the jet to condense it. To\r\nregulate this, the valve or cock by which the water was admitted\r\ninto the condenser was worked in the double-acting engine by a\r\nlever furnished with an index, by which the quantity of condensing\r\nwater admitted into the condenser could be regulated. This index\r\nplayed upon a graduated arch, by which the engine-man was enabled\r\nto regulate the supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEATHFIELD HOUSE, NEAR BIRMINGHAM, THE RESIDENCE OF\r\nWATT.]\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [20] These effects are explained in my Treatise on Heat; and\r\n  they have lately been verified by experiments made with\r\n  locomotive engines by M. de Pambour, who found that the steam\r\n  raised from the boiler of a locomotive engine, under a\r\n  pressure of above 50 lbs. per square inch, was in the state of\r\n  common steam as it issued from the chimney at a very diminished\r\n  pressure and at a lower pressure.\r\n\r\n  [21] It is strange that this absurdity has been repeatedly\r\n  given as unquestionable fact in various encyclopædias, as well\r\n  as in by far the greater number of treatises expressly on the\r\n  subject.\r\n\r\n  [22] Farey, Treatise on the Steam Engine, p. 122.\r\n\r\n  [23] Farey on the Steam Engine, p. 297.\r\n\r\n[Pg193]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOUBLE-ACTING ENGINE.—CITY SAW-MILLS.]\r\n\r\nCHAP.

In the single-acting engine, the force of the piston acted\r\non the beam only during its descent; and this force was\r\ntransmitted from the piston to the beam, as we have seen, by a\r\nflexible chain, extended from the end of the piston-rod, [Pg194]\r\nand playing upon the arch head of the beam. In the double-acting\r\nengine, however, the force of the steam pressing the piston\r\nupwards must likewise be transmitted to the beam, so as to drive\r\nthe latter upwards while the piston ascends. This action could not\r\nbe accomplished by a chain connecting the piston with the arch\r\nhead of the beam.\r\n\r\nWhere the mechanical action to be transmitted is a _pull_, and not\r\na _push_, a flexible chain, cord, or strap, is sufficient; but if\r\na _push_ or _thrust_ is required to be transmitted, then the\r\nflexibility of the medium of mechanical communication afforded by\r\na chain renders it inapplicable. In the double-acting engine,\r\nduring the descent, the piston-rod still pulls the beam down; and\r\nso far a chain connecting the piston-rod with the beam would be\r\nsufficient to transmit the action of the one to the other; but in\r\nthe ascent, the beam no longer pulls up the piston-rod, but is\r\npushed up by it. A chain from the piston-rod to the arch head, as\r\ndescribed in the single-acting engine, would fail to transmit this\r\nforce. If such a chain were used with the double engine, where\r\nthere is no counterweight on the opposite end of the beam, the\r\nconsequence would be, that in the ascent of the piston the chain\r\nwould slacken, and the beam would still remain depressed. It is\r\ntherefore necessary that some other mechanical connection be\r\ncontrived between the piston-rod and the beam, of such a nature\r\nthat in the _descent_ the piston-rod may _pull_ the beam down, and\r\nmay _push_ it up in the _ascent_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 35.]\r\n\r\nWatt first proposed to effect this by attaching to the end of the\r\npiston-rod a straight rack, faced with teeth, which should work in\r\ncorresponding teeth raised on the arch head of the beam, as\r\nrepresented in _fig._ 35. If his improved steam engines required no\r\nfurther precision of operation and construction than the atmospheric\r\nengines, this might have been sufficient; but in these engines it\r\nwas indispensably necessary that the piston-rod should be guided\r\nwith a smooth and even motion through the stuffing-box in the top of\r\nthe cylinder, otherwise any shake or irregularity would cause it to\r\nwork loose in the stuffing-box, and either to admit the air, or to\r\nlet the steam escape. Under these circumstances, the motion of\r\n[Pg195] the rack and toothed arch head were inadmissible, since it\r\nwas impossible by such means to impart to the piston-rod that smooth\r\nand equable motion which was requisite. Another contrivance which\r\noccurred to Watt was, to attach to the top of the piston-rod a bar,\r\nwhich should extend above the beam, and to use two chains or straps,\r\none extending from the top of the bar to the lower end of the arch\r\nhead, and the other from the bottom of the bar to the upper end of\r\nthe arch head. By such means the latter strap would pull the beam\r\ndown when the piston would descend, and the former would pull the\r\nbeam up when the piston would ascend. These contrivances, however,\r\nwere superseded by the celebrated mechanism since called the\r\n_Parallel Motion_, one of the most ingenious mechanical combinations\r\nconnected with the history of the steam engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n(119.) It will be observed that the object was to connect by some\r\ninflexible means the end of the piston-rod with the extremity of\r\nthe beam, and so to contrive the mechanism, that while the end of\r\nthe beam would move alternately up and down in part of a circle,\r\nthe end of the piston-rod connected with the beam should move up\r\nand down in a straight line. If the end of the piston-rod were\r\nfastened upon the end of the beam by a pivot without any other\r\nconnection, it is evident that, being moved up and down in the\r\narch of a circle, it would be drawn to the left and the right\r\nalternately, and would consequently either be broken or bent, or\r\nwould work loose in the stuffing-box. Instead of connecting the\r\nend of the rod immediately with the end of the beam by a pivot,\r\nWatt proposed to connect them by certain moveable rods, so\r\narranged that, as the end of the beam would move up and down in\r\nthe circular arch, the rods would so accommodate themselves to\r\nthat motion, that the end connected with the piston-rod should not\r\nbe disturbed from its rectilinear course.\r\n\r\nTo explain the principle of the mechanism called the parallel\r\nmotion, let us suppose that O P (_fig._ 36.) is a rod or lever\r\nmoveable on a centre O, and that the end P of this rod shall move\r\nthrough a circular arch P P′ P″ P‴ a vertical plane, and let its\r\nplay be limited by two stops S, which shall prevent its ascent\r\nabove the point P, and its descent below [Pg196] the point P‴.\r\nLet the position of the rod and the limitation of its play be such\r\nthat the straight line A B drawn through P and P‴, the extreme\r\npositions of the lever O P, shall be a vertical line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 36.]\r\n\r\nLet _o_ be a point on the other side of the vertical line A B, and\r\nlet the distance of O to the right of A B be the same as the\r\ndistance of _o_ to the left of A B. Let _o p_ be a rod equal in\r\nlength to O P, moving like O P on the centre _o_, so that its\r\n[Pg197] extremity _p_ shall play upwards and downwards through the\r\narch _p p′ p″ p‴_, its play being limited in like manner by stops\r\n_s_.\r\n\r\nNow, let us suppose that the ends P _p_ of these two rods are joined\r\nby a link P _p_, the connection being made by a pivot, so that the\r\nangles formed by the link and the rods shall be capable of changing\r\ntheir magnitude. This link will make the motion of one rod depend on\r\nthat of the other, since it will preserve their extremities P _p_\r\nalways at the same distance from each other. If, therefore, we\r\nsuppose the rod O P to be moved to the position O P‴, its extremity\r\nP tracing the arch P P′ P″ P‴, the link connecting the rods will at\r\nthe same time drive the extremity _p_ of the rod _o p_ through the\r\narch _p p′ p″ p‴_ so that when the extremity of the one rod arrives\r\nat P‴, the extremity of the other rod will arrive at _p‴_. By this\r\narrangement, in the simultaneous motion of the rods, whether upwards\r\nor downwards, through the circular arches to which their play is\r\nlimited, the extremities of the link joining them will deviate from\r\nthe vertical line A B in opposite directions. At the limits of their\r\nplay, the extremities of the link will always be in the line A B;\r\nbut in all intermediate positions, the lower extremity of the link\r\nwill be to the right of A B, and its upper extremity to the left of\r\nA B. So far as the derangement of the lower extremity of the link is\r\nconcerned, the matter composing the link would be transferred to the\r\nright of A B, and so far as the upper extremity of the link is\r\nconcerned, the matter composing it would be transferred to the left\r\nof A B.\r\n\r\nBy the combined effects of these contrary derangements of the\r\nextremities of the link from the vertical line, it might be\r\nexpected that a point would exist, in the middle of the link,\r\nwhere the two contrary derangements would neutralise each other,\r\nand which point would therefore be expected to be disturbed\r\nneither to the right nor to the left, but to be moved upwards and\r\ndownwards in the vertical line A B. Such is the principle of the\r\nparallel motion; and in fact the middle point of the link will\r\nmove for all practical purposes accurately in the vertical line A\r\nB, provided that the angular play of the levers O P and _o p_ does\r\nnot exceed a certain [Pg198] limit, within which, in practice,\r\ntheir motion may always be restrained.\r\n\r\nTo trace the motion of the middle point of the link more minutely,\r\nlet P P′ P″ P‴ be four positions of the lever O P, and let _p_ _p′_\r\n_p″_ _p‴_ be the four corresponding positions of the lever _o p_. In\r\nthe positions O P _o p_, the link will take the position P _p_, in\r\nwhich the entire link will be vertical, and its middle point _x_\r\nwill therefore be in the vertical line A B.\r\n\r\nWhen the one rod takes the position O P′, the other rod will have\r\nthe position _o p′_; and the link will have the position P′ _p′_.\r\nThe middle point of the link will be at _x′_, which will be found\r\nto be on the vertical line A B. Thus one half of the link P′ _x′_\r\nwill be to the left of the vertical line A B; while the other\r\nhalf, _p′ x′_, will be to the right of the vertical line; the\r\nderangement from the vertical line affecting each half of the link\r\nin contrary directions.\r\n\r\nAgain, taking the one rod in the position O P″, the corresponding\r\nposition of the other rod will be _o p″_, and the position of the\r\nlink will be P″ _p″_. If the middle point of the link in this\r\nposition be taken, it will be found to be at _x″_, on the vertical\r\nline A B; and, as before, one half of the link P″ _x″_ will be\r\nthrown to the left of the vertical line, while the other half _p″\r\nx″_, will be thrown to the right of the vertical line.\r\n\r\nFinally, let the one rod be in its lowest position, O P‴, while\r\nthe other rod shall take the corresponding position, _o p‴_. The\r\ndirection of the link P‴ _p‴_ will now coincide with the vertical\r\nline; and its middle point _x‴_ will therefore be upon that line.\r\nThe previous derangement of the extremities of the rod, to the\r\nright and to the left, are now redressed, and all the parts of the\r\nrod have assumed the vertical position.\r\n\r\nIt is plain, therefore, that by such means the alternate motion of\r\na point such as P or _p_, upwards and downwards in a circular\r\narch, may be made to produce the alternate motions of another\r\npoint _x_, upwards and downwards in a straight line.\r\n\r\n\r\n(120.) Although the guidance of the air-pump rod in a true\r\nvertical line is not so necessary as that of the steam piston,\r\n[Pg199] and as the air-pump piston is always brought down by its\r\nown weight and that of its rod, the connection of the air-pump\r\npiston-rod with the beam, by any contrivance of the kind now\r\ndescribed, was not so necessary. Nevertheless, by a slight\r\naddition to the mechanical contrivance which has been just\r\ndescribed, Watt obtained the means of at once preserving the true\r\nrectilinear motion of both piston-rods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 37.]\r\n\r\nLet the lever represented by O P in _fig._ 36. be conceived to be\r\nprolonged to twice its length, as represented in _fig._ 37., so\r\nthat O P′ shall be twice O P. Let the points P _p_ be connected by\r\na link as before. Let a link P′ _x′_, equal in length to the link\r\nP _p_ be attached to the point P′, and let the extremity _x′_ of\r\nthis link be connected with the point _p_ by another link, equal\r\nin length to P P′, by pivots at _x′_ and _p_, so that the figure P\r\nP′ _x′ p_ shall be a jointed parallelogram, the angles of which\r\nwill be capable of altering their magnitude with every change of\r\nposition of the rods _o p_ and O P. Thus, when the rod O P\r\ndescends, the angles of the parallelogram at P and _x′_ will be\r\ndiminished in magnitude, while the angles at P′ and _p_ will be\r\nincreased in magnitude. Now, let a line be conceived to be drawn\r\nfrom O to _x′_. It is evident that that line will pass through the\r\nmiddle point of the link _p_ P, for the triangle O P _x_ is in all\r\nrespects similar to the greater triangle O P′ _x′_ only on half\r\nthe scale, so that every side of the one is [Pg200] half the\r\ncorresponding side of the other. Therefore P _x_ is half the\r\nlength of P′ _x′_; but P′ _x′_ was made equal to P _p_, and\r\ntherefore _p x_ is half of P _p_, that is to say, _x_ is the\r\nmiddle point of P _p_.\r\n\r\nIt has been already shown, that in the alternate motion of the\r\nrods _o p_, O P in ascending and descending, the point _x_ is\r\nmoved upwards and downwards in a true vertical line. Now since the\r\ntriangle O P _x_ is in all respects similar to O P′ _x′_, and\r\nsubject to a similar motion during the ascent and descent of the\r\nrods, it is apparent that the point _x′_ must be subject to a\r\nmotion in all respects similar to that which affects the points\r\n_x_, except that the point _x′_ will move through double the\r\nspace. In fact, the principle of the mechanism is precisely\r\nsimilar to that of the common pantograph, where two rods are so\r\nconnected as that the motion of the one governs the motion of the\r\nother, so that whatever line or figure may be described by one, a\r\nsimilar line or figure must be described by the other. Since,\r\nthen, the point _x_ is moved upwards and downwards in a vertical\r\nstraight line, the point _x′_ will also be moved in a vertical\r\nstraight line of double the length.\r\n\r\nIf such an arrangement of mechanism as has been here described can\r\nbe connected with the beam of the steam engine, so that while the\r\npoint _x′_ is attached to the top of the steam piston, and the\r\nspace through which it ascends and descends shall be equal to the\r\nlength of the stroke of that piston, the point _x_ shall be\r\nattached to the rod of the air-pump piston, the stroke of the\r\nlatter being half that of the steam piston, then the points _x′_\r\nand _x_ will guide the motion of the two pistons so as to preserve\r\nthem in true vertical straight lines.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these ideas are reduced to practice admits of\r\neasy explanation: let the point O be the centre of the great\r\nworking beam, and let O P′ be the arm of the beam on the side of\r\nthe steam cylinder. Let P be a pivot upon the beam, at the middle\r\npoint between its centre O and its extremity P′; and let the links\r\nP p, P′ _x′_, and P _p_ be jointed together, as already described.\r\nLet the point or pivot _o_ be attached to some part of the fixed\r\nframing of the engine or engine house, and let the rod _o p_,\r\nequal to half the arm of the beam, be attached by a pivot to the\r\ncorner of the parallelogram at [Pg201] _p_. Let the end of the\r\nsteam piston-rod be attached to the corner of the parallelogram\r\n_x′_, and let the end of the air-pump be attached to the middle\r\npoint _x_ of the link P _p_; by which arrangement it is evident\r\nthat the rectilinear motion of the two piston-rods will be\r\nrendered compatible with the alternate circular motions of the\r\npoints P′ and P on the beam.\r\n\r\nAmong the many mechanical inventions produced by the fertile\r\ngenius of Watt, there is none which has excited such universal,\r\nsuch unqualified, and such merited admiration as that of the\r\nparallel motion. It is indeed impossible, even for an eye\r\nunaccustomed to view mechanical combinations, to behold the beam\r\nof a steam engine moving the pistons, through the instrumentality\r\nof the parallel motion, without an instinctive feeling of pleasure\r\nat the unexpected fulfilment of an end by means having so little\r\napparent connection with it. When this feeling was expressed to\r\nWatt himself, by those who first beheld the performance of this\r\nexquisite mechanism, he exclaimed with his usual vivacity, that he\r\nhimself, when he first beheld his own contrivance in action, was\r\naffected by the same sense of pleasure and surprise at its\r\nregularity and precision. He said, that he received from it the\r\nsame species of enjoyment that usually accompanies the first view\r\nof the successful invention of another person.\r\n\r\n\"Among the parts composing the steam engine, you have doubtless,\"\r\nsays M. Arago, \"observed a certain articulated parallelogram. At\r\neach ascent and descent of the piston, its angles open and close\r\nwith the sweetness—I had almost said with the grace—which charms\r\nyou in the gestures of a consummate actor. Follow with your eye\r\nalternately the progress of its successive changes, and you will\r\nfind them subject to the most curious geometrical conditions. You\r\nwill see, that of the four angles of the jointed parallelogram,\r\nthree describe circular arches, but the fourth which holds the\r\npiston-rod is moved nearly in a straight line. The immense utility\r\nof this result strikes mechanicians with even less force than the\r\nsimplicity of the means by which Watt has attained it.\"\r\n\r\nThe parallel motion, of which there are several other varieties,\r\ndepending, however, generally upon the same [Pg202] principle,\r\nformed part of a patent which Mr. Watt obtained in the year 1784,\r\nanother part of which patent was for a locomotive engine, by which\r\na carriage was to be propelled on a road. In a letter to Mr.\r\nSmeaton dated 22d October, in the same year, Watt says,—\r\n\r\n\"I have lately contrived several methods of getting entirely rid\r\nof all the chains and circular arches about the great levers of\r\nsteam engines, and nevertheless making the piston-rods ascend and\r\ndescend perpendicularly, without any sliding motions or\r\nright-lined guides, merely by combinations of motions about\r\ncentres; and with this further advantage, that they answer equally\r\nwell to push upwards as to pull downwards, so that this method is\r\napplicable to our double engines which act both in the ascent and\r\ndescent of their pistons.\r\n\r\n\"A rotative engine of this species with the new motion which is\r\nnow at work in our manufactory (but must be sent away very soon)\r\nanswers admirably. It has cost much brain work to contrive proper\r\nworking gear for these double engines, but I have at last done it\r\ntolerably well, by means of the circular valves, placed in an\r\ninverted position, so as to be opened by the force of the steam;\r\nand they are kept shut by the working gear. We have erected an\r\nengine at Messrs. Goodwyne and Co.'s brewery, East Smithfield,\r\nLondon.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 38.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(121.) By the contrivance which has been explained above, the\r\nforce of the piston in ascending and descending would be conveyed\r\nto the working end of the beam; and the next problem which Watt\r\nhad to solve was, to produce by the force exerted by the working\r\nend of the beam in ascending and descending a continuous motion of\r\nrotation. In the first instance he proposed to accomplish this by\r\na crank placed upon the axle to which rotation was to be imparted,\r\nand driven by a rod connecting it with the working end of the\r\nbeam. Let K (_fig._ 38.) be the centre, to which motion is to be\r\nimparted by the working end H of the beam. On the axle K suppose a\r\nshort lever K I to be fixed so that when K I is turned round the\r\ncentre K, the axle must turn with it. Let an iron rod, the weight\r\nof which shall balance the piston and piston-rod at the other end\r\nof the beam, be connected by joints with the working end H of the\r\nbeam, and the extremity I of the [Pg203] lever K I. As the end H\r\nof the beam is moved upwards and downwards, the lever K I will be\r\nturned round the centre K, taking successively the positions\r\nrepresented by faint lines in the figure; and thus a motion of\r\ncontinued rotation will be imparted to the axle K.\r\n\r\nThis simple and effectual expedient of producing a continued\r\nrotatory motion by a crank was abandoned by Watt, as already\r\nexplained, by reason of a patent having been obtained upon\r\ninformation of his experiments surreptitiously procured. To avoid\r\nlitigation, he therefore substituted for the crank the sun and\r\nplanet wheel already described; but at the expiration of the\r\npatent, which restricted the use of the crank, the sun and planet\r\nwheel was discontinued in Watt's engine, and the crank restored.\r\n\r\n\r\n(122.) Whether the crank or the sun and planet wheel be used,\r\nthere is still a difficulty in the maintenance of a regular motion\r\nof rotation. In the various positions which the crank and\r\nconnecting rod assume throughout a complete revolution, there are\r\ntwo in which the moving power loses all influence in impelling the\r\ncrank. These positions are those which the crank assumes when the\r\npiston is at the top and bottom of the [Pg204] cylinder, and is\r\njust about to change the direction of its motion. When the piston\r\nis at the bottom of the cylinder, the pivot I (_fig._ 38.), by\r\nwhich the connecting rod H I is attached to the end of the crank,\r\nis immediately over the axle K of the crank, and under the pivot\r\nH, which joins the upper end of the connecting rod with the beam.\r\nIn fact, in this position the connecting rod and crank are in the\r\nsame straight line, extending from the end of the beam to the axle\r\nof the crank. The steam, on entering the cylinder below the\r\npiston, and pressing it upwards, would produce a corresponding\r\ndownward force on the connecting rod at H, which would be\r\ncontinued along the connecting rod and crank to the axle K. It is\r\nevident that such a force could have no tendency to turn the crank\r\nround, but would expend its whole energy in pressing the axle K\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\nThe other position in which the power loses its effect upon the\r\ncrank is when the piston is at the top of the cylinder. In this\r\ncase, the working end of the beam will be at the lowest point of\r\nits play, and the crank-pin I will be immediately below the axle\r\nK; so that K will be placed immediately between H and I. When the\r\nsteam presses on the top of the piston, it will expend its force\r\nin drawing the end H of the connecting rod upwards, by which the\r\ncrank-pin I will likewise be drawn upwards. It is evident that\r\nthis force can have no effect in turning the crank round, but will\r\nexpend its whole energy in producing an upward strain on the axle\r\nK.\r\n\r\nIf the crank were absolutely at rest in either of the positions\r\nabove described, it is apparent that the engine could not be put\r\nin motion by the steam; but if the engine has been previously in\r\nmotion, then the mass of matter forming the crank, and the axle on\r\nwhich the crank is formed, having already had a motion of\r\nrotation, will have a tendency to preserve the momentum it has\r\nreceived, and this tendency will be sufficient to throw the crank\r\nK I out of either of those critical positions which have been\r\ndescribed. Having once escaped these dead points, then the\r\nconnecting rod forming an angle, however obtuse or acute, with the\r\ncrank, the pressure or pull upon the former will have a tendency\r\nto produce rotation in the latter. As the crank revolves, however,\r\nthe influence [Pg205] of the connecting rod upon it will vary\r\naccording to the angle formed by the connecting rod and crank.\r\nWhen that angle is a right angle, then the effect of the\r\nconnecting rod on the crank is greatest, since the force upon it\r\nhas the advantage of the whole leverage of the crank; but\r\naccording as the angle formed by the crank and connecting rod\r\nbecomes more or less acute or obtuse in the successive attitudes\r\nwhich they assume in the revolution of the crank, the influence of\r\nthe connecting rod over the crank varies, changing from nothing at\r\nthe two dead points already described, to the full effect produced\r\nin the two positions where they are at right angles. In\r\nconsequence of this varying leverage, by which the force with\r\nwhich the connecting rod is driven by the steam is transmitted to\r\nthe axle on which the crank revolves, a corresponding variation of\r\nspeed would necessarily be produced in the motion imparted to the\r\ncrank. The speed at the dead points would be least, being due\r\naltogether to the momentum already imparted to the revolving mass\r\nof the crank and axle; and it would gradually increase and be\r\ngreatest at the points where the effect of the crank on the\r\nconnecting rod is greatest. Although this change of speed would\r\nnot affect the actual mechanical efficacy of the machine, and\r\nalthough the same quantity of steam would perform the same work at\r\nthe varying velocity as it would do if the velocity were\r\nregulated, yet this variation of speed would be incompatible with\r\nthe purposes to which it was now proposed that the steam engine\r\nshould be applied in manufactures. In these a regular uniform\r\nmotion should be imparted to the main axle.\r\n\r\n\r\n(123.) One of the expedients which Watt proposed for the\r\nattainment of this end was, by placing two cranks on the same\r\naxle, in different positions, to be worked by different cylinders,\r\nso that while one crank should be at its dead points, the other\r\nshould be in the attitude most favourable for its action. This\r\nexpedient has since, as we shall see, been carried into effect in\r\nsteam vessels; but one more simple and efficient presented itself\r\nin the use of a _fly-wheel_.\r\n\r\nOn the main axle driven by the crank Watt placed a large wheel of\r\nmetal, as represented in _fig._ 43., called a _fly-wheel_. This\r\nwheel being well constructed, and nicely balanced on its [Pg206]\r\naxle, was subject to very little resistance from friction; any\r\nmoving force which it would receive it would therefore retain, and\r\nwould be ready to impart such moving force to the main axle\r\nwhenever that axle ceased to be driven by the power. When the\r\ncrank, therefore, is in those positions in which the action of the\r\npower upon it is most efficient, a portion of the energy of the\r\npower is expended in increasing the velocity of the mass of matter\r\ncomposing the fly-wheel. As the crank approaches the dead points,\r\nthe effect of the moving power upon the axle and upon the crank is\r\ngradually enfeebled, and at these points vanishes altogether. The\r\nmomentum which has been imparted to the fly-wheel then comes into\r\nplay, and carries forward the axle and crank out of the dead\r\npoints with a velocity very little less than that which it had\r\nwhen the crank was in the most favourable position for receiving\r\nthe action of the moving power.\r\n\r\nBy this expedient, the motion of revolution received by the axle\r\nfrom the steam piston is subject to no other variation than just\r\nthe amount of change of momentum in the great mass of the\r\nfly-wheel, which is sufficient to extricate the crank twice in\r\nevery revolution from the mechanical dilemma to which its peculiar\r\nform exposes it; and this change of velocity may be reduced to as\r\nsmall an amount as can be requisite by giving the necessary weight\r\nand magnitude to the fly-wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\n(124.) By such arrangements the motion imparted to the main axle K\r\nwould be uniform, provided that the moving power of the engine be\r\nalways proportionate to the load which it drives. But in the\r\ngeneral application of the steam engine to manufactures it was\r\nevident that the amount of the resistance to which any given\r\nmachine would be subject must be liable to variation. If, for\r\nexample, the engine drive a cotton-mill, it will have to impart\r\nmotion to all the spinning frames in that mill. The operation of\r\none or more of these may from time to time be suspended, and the\r\nmoving power would be relieved from a corresponding amount of\r\nresistance. If, under such circumstances, the energy of the moving\r\npower remained the same, the velocity with which the machines\r\nwould be driven would be subject to variation, being increased\r\nwhenever the operation of any portion of the machines usually\r\n[Pg207] driven by it is suspended; and, on the other hand,\r\ndiminished when any increased number of machines are brought into\r\noperation. In fine, the speed would vary nearly in the inverse\r\nproportion of the load driven, increasing as the load is\r\ndiminished, and _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, supposing that no change took place in the\r\namount of the load driven by the engine, and that the same number\r\nof machines of whatever kind would have to be continually driven,\r\nthe motion imparted to the main axle would still be subject to\r\nvariation by the changes inevitable to the moving power. The\r\npiston of the engine being subject to an unvaried resistance, a\r\nuniform motion could only be imparted to it, by maintaining a\r\ncorresponding uniformity in the impelling power. This would\r\nrequire a uniform supply of steam from the boiler, which would\r\nfurther imply a uniform rate of evaporation in the boiler, unless\r\nmeans were provided in the admission of steam from the boiler to\r\nthe cylinder to prevent any excess of steam which might be\r\nproduced in the boiler from reaching the cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 39.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 40.]\r\n\r\nThis end was attained by a contrivance afterwards called the\r\n_throttle-valve_. An axis A B (_figs._ 39, 40.) was placed across\r\nthe steam pipe in a ring of cast-iron D E, of proper thickness. On\r\nthis axis was fastened a thin circular plate T, of nearly the same\r\ndiameter as the steam pipe. On the outer end B of this axle was\r\nplaced a short lever or handle B C, by which it could be turned.\r\nWhen the circular plate T was turned into such a position as to be\r\nat right angles to the length of the tube, it stopped the passage\r\nwithin the tube altogether, so that no steam could pass from the\r\nboiler to the engine. On the other hand, when the handle was\r\nturned through a fourth of a revolution from this position, then\r\nthe circular plate T had its plane in the direction of the length\r\nof the tube, so that its edge would be presented towards the\r\ncurrent of steam flowing from the boiler to the cylinder. In that\r\nposition the passage within the tube [Pg208] would be necessarily\r\nunobstructed by the throttle-valve. In intermediate positions of\r\nthe valve, as that represented in _figs._ 39, 40., the passage\r\nmight be left more or less opened, so that steam from the boiler\r\nmight be admitted to the cylinder in any regulated quantity\r\naccording to the position given to the lever B C.\r\n\r\nA view of the throttle-valve taken by a section across the steam\r\npipe is exhibited in _fig._ 40., and a section of it through the\r\naxis of the steam pipe is represented in _fig._ 39. The form of\r\nthe valve is such, that, if accurately constructed, the steam in\r\npassing from the boiler would have no effect by its pressure to\r\nalter any position which might be given to the valve; and any\r\nslight inaccuracy of form which might give a tendency to the steam\r\nto alter the position would be easily counteracted by the friction\r\nof the valve upon its axle. The latter might be regulated at\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nBy this expedient, however the evaporation of water in the boiler\r\nmight vary within practical limits, the supply of steam to the\r\ncylinder would be rendered regular and uniform. If the boiler became\r\ntoo active, and produced more steam than was necessary to move the\r\nengine with its load at the requisite speed, then the throttle-valve\r\nwas shifted so as to contract the passage and limit the supply of\r\nsteam. If, on the other hand, the process of evaporation in the\r\nboiler was relaxed, then the throttle-valve was placed with its edge\r\nmore directed towards the steam. Independently of the boiler, if the\r\nload on the engine was lightened, then the same supply of steam to\r\nthe cylinder would unduly accelerate the motion. In this case,\r\nlikewise, the partial closing of the throttle-valve would limit the\r\nsupply of steam and regulate the motion; and if, on the other hand,\r\nthe increase of load upon the engine rendered necessary an increased\r\nsupply of steam, then the opening of the throttle-valve would\r\naccomplish the purpose. By these means, therefore, a uniform motion\r\nmight be maintained, provided the vigilance of the engine-man\r\nwas sufficient for the due management of the lever B C, and\r\nprovided that the furnace under the boiler was kept in sufficient\r\nactivity to supply the greatest amount of steam which would be\r\nnecessary [Pg209] for the maintenance of a uniform motion with the\r\nthrottle-valve fully opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n(125.) Watt, however, soon perceived that the proper manipulation\r\nof the lever B C would be impracticable with any degree of\r\nvigilance and skill which could be obtained from the persons\r\nemployed to attend the engine. He, therefore, adapted to this\r\npurpose a beautiful application of a piece of mechanism, which had\r\nbeen previously used in the regulation of mill-work, and which has\r\nsince been well known by the name of the _Governor_, and has\r\nalways been deservedly a subject of much admiration.\r\n\r\nThe governor is an apparatus by which the axle of the fly-wheel is\r\nmade to regulate the throttle-valve, so that the moment that the\r\naxle begins to increase its velocity, it shifts the position of\r\nthe throttle-valve, so as to limit the supply of steam from the\r\nboiler, and thereby to check the increase of speed. And on the\r\nother hand, whenever the velocity of the axle is diminished, the\r\nlever B C is moved in the contrary direction, so as to open more\r\nfully the passage for the steam, and accelerate the motion of the\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nA small grooved wheel A B (_fig._ 41.) is attached to a vertical\r\nspindle supported in pivots or sockets C and D, in which it is\r\ncapable of revolving. An endless cord works in the groove A B, and\r\nis carried over proper pulleys to the axle of the fly-wheel, where\r\nit likewise works in a groove. When this cord is properly\r\ntightened the motion of the fly-wheel will give motion to the\r\nwheel A B, so that the velocity of the one will be subject to all\r\nthe changes incidental to the velocity of the other. By this means\r\nthe speed of the grooved wheel A B may be considered as\r\nrepresenting the speed of the fly-wheel, and of the machinery\r\nwhich the axle of the fly-wheel drives.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 41.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the same end might be attained by substituting\r\nfor the grooved wheel A B a toothed wheel, which might be\r\nconnected by other toothed wheels, and proper shafts, and axles\r\nwith the axle of the fly-wheel.\r\n\r\nA ring or collar E is placed on the upright spindle, so as to be\r\ncapable of moving freely upwards and downwards. To this ring are\r\nattached by pivots two short levers, E F, the [Pg210] pivots or\r\njoints at E allowing these levers to play upon them. At F these\r\nlevers are joined by pivots to other levers F G, which cross each\r\nother at H, where an axle or pin passes through them, and attaches\r\nthem to the upright spindle C D. These intersecting levers are\r\ncapable, however, of playing on this axle or pin H. To the ends G\r\nof these levers are attached two heavy balls of metal I. The\r\nlevers F G pass through slits in a metallic arch attached to the\r\nupright spindle, so as to be capable of revolving upon it. If the\r\nballs I are drawn outwards from the vertical axis, it is evident\r\nthat the ends F of the levers will be drawn down, and therefore\r\nthe pivots E likewise drawn down. In fact, the angles E F H will\r\nbecome more acute, and the angle F E F more obtuse. By these means\r\nthe sliding ring E will be drawn down. To this sliding ring E, and\r\nimmediately above it, is attached a grooved collar, which slides\r\non the vertical spindle upwards and downwards with the ring E. In\r\nthe grooved collar are inserted the prongs of a fork K, formed at\r\nthe end of the lever K L, the fulcrum or pivot of the lever being\r\nat L. By this arrangement, when the divergence of the balls I\r\ncauses the collar E to be drawn down, the fork K, whose prongs are\r\ninserted in the groove of that collar, is likewise drawn down;\r\nand, on the other hand, when, by reason of the balls I falling\r\ntowards the [Pg211] vertical spindle, the collar E is raised, the\r\nfork K is likewise raised.\r\n\r\nThe ascent and descent of the fork K necessarily produce a\r\ncontrary motion in the other end N of the lever. This end is\r\nconnected by a rod, or system of rods, with the end M of the short\r\nlever which works the throttle-valve T. By such means the motion\r\nof the balls I, towards or from the vertical spindle, produces in\r\nthe throttle-valve a corresponding motion; and they are so\r\nconnected that the divergence of the balls I will cause the\r\nthrottle-valve to close, while their descent towards the vertical\r\nspindle will cause it to open.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements being comprehended, let us suppose that, either\r\nby reason of a diminished load upon the engine or an increased\r\nactivity of the boiler, the speed has a tendency to increase. This\r\nwould impart increased velocity to the grooved wheel A B, which\r\nwould cause the balls I to revolve with an accelerated speed. The\r\ncentrifugal force which attends their motion would therefore give\r\nthem a tendency to move from the axle, or to diverge. This would\r\ncause, by the means already explained, the throttle-valve T to be\r\npartially closed, by which the supply of steam from the boiler to\r\nthe cylinder would be diminished, and the energy of the moving\r\npower, therefore, mitigated. The undue increase of speed would\r\nthereby be prevented.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, either by an increase of the load, or a\r\ndiminished activity in the boiler, the speed of the machine was\r\nlessened, a corresponding diminution of velocity would take place\r\nin the grooved wheel A B. This would cause the balls I to revolve\r\nwith less speed, and the centrifugal force produced by their\r\ncircular motion would be diminished. This force being thus no\r\nlonger able fully to counteract their gravity, they would fall\r\ntowards the spindle, which would cause, as already explained, the\r\nthrottle-valve to be more fully opened. This would produce a more\r\nample supply of steam to the cylinder, by which the velocity of\r\nthe machine would be restored to its proper amount.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 42.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(126.) The principle which renders the governor so perfect a\r\nregulator of the velocity of the machine is difficult to be\r\n[Pg212] explained without having recourse to the aid of the\r\ntechnical language of mathematical physics. As, however, this\r\ninstrument is of such great practical importance, and has\r\nattracted such general admiration, it may be worth while here to\r\nattempt to render intelligible the mechanical principles which\r\ngovern its operation. Let S (_fig._ 42.) be the point of\r\nsuspension of a common pendulum S P, and let P O P′ be the arch of\r\nits vibration, so that the ball P shall swing or vibrate\r\nalternately to the east and to the west of the lowest point O,\r\nthrough the arches O P′ and O P. It is a property of such an\r\ninstrument that, provided the arch in which it vibrates be not\r\nconsiderable in magnitude, the time of its vibration will be the\r\nsame whether the arch be long or short. Thus, for example, if the\r\npendulum, instead of vibrating in the arch P P′, vibrated in the\r\narch _p p′_, the time which it would take to perform its\r\nvibrations would be the same. If, however, the magnitude of the\r\narch of vibration be increased, then a variation will take place\r\nin the time of vibration; but unless the arch of vibration be\r\nconsiderably increased, this variation will not be great.\r\n\r\nNow let it be supposed that while the pendulum P P′ continues to\r\nvibrate east and west through the arch P P′, it shall receive such\r\nan impulse from north and south as would, if it were not in a\r\nstate of previous vibration, cause it to vibrate between north and\r\nsouth, in an arch similar to the arch P P′. This second vibration\r\nbetween north and south [Pg213] would not prevent the continuance\r\nof the other vibration between east and west; but the ball P would\r\nbe at the same time affected by both vibrations. While, in virtue\r\nof the vibration from east to west, the ball would swing from P to\r\nP′, it would, in virtue of the other vibration, extend its motion\r\ntowards the north to a distance from the line W E equal to half a\r\nvibration, and will return from that distance again to the\r\nposition P′. While returning from P′ to P, its second vibration\r\nwill carry it towards the south to an equal distance on the\r\nsouthern side of W E, and it will return again to the position P.\r\nIf the combination of these two motions or vibrations be\r\nattentively considered, it will be perceived that the effect on\r\nthe ball will be a circular motion, precisely similar to the\r\ncircular motion of the balls of the governor already described.\r\n\r\nNow the time of vibration of the pendulum S P between east and\r\nwest will not in any way be affected by the second vibration,\r\nwhich it is supposed to receive between north and south, and\r\ntherefore the time the pendulum takes in moving from P to P′ and\r\nback again from P′ to P will be the same whether it shall have\r\nsimultaneously or not the other vibration between north and south.\r\nHence it follows that the time of revolution of the circular\r\npendulum will be equal to the time of similar vibrations of the\r\nsame pendulum, if, instead of having a circular motion, it were\r\nallowed to vibrate in the manner of a common pendulum.\r\n\r\nIf this point be understood, and if it also be remembered that the\r\ntime of vibration of a common pendulum is necessarily the same\r\nwhether the arch of vibration be small or great, it will be easily\r\nperceived that the revolving pendulum or governor will have nearly\r\nthe same time of revolution whether it revolve in a large circle\r\nor a small one: in other words, whether the balls revolve at a\r\ngreater or a less distance from the central spindle or axis. This,\r\nhowever, is to be understood only approximately. When the angle of\r\ndivergence of the balls is as considerable as it usually is in\r\ngovernors, the time of revolution at different distances from the\r\naxis will therefore be subject to some variation, but to a very\r\nsmall one. [Pg214]\r\n\r\nThe centrifugal force (which is the name given in mechanics to\r\nthat influence which makes a body revolving in a circle fly from\r\nthe centre) depends conjointly on the velocity of revolution, and\r\non the distance of the revolving body from the centre of the\r\ncircle. If the velocity of revolution be the same, then the\r\ncentrifugal force will increase in the same proportion as the\r\ndistance of the revolving body from the centre. If, on the other\r\nhand, the distance of the revolving body from the centre remain\r\nthe same, the centrifugal force will increase in the same\r\nproportion as the square of the time of vibration diminishes, or,\r\nin other words, it will increase in the same proportion as the\r\nsquare of the number of revolutions per minute. It follows from\r\nthis, therefore, that the greater is the divergence of the balls\r\nof the governor, and the more rapidly they revolve, the greater\r\nwill be their centrifugal force. Now this centrifugal force, if it\r\nwere not counterbalanced, would give the balls a constant tendency\r\nto recede from the centre; but from the construction of the\r\napparatus, the further they are removed from the centre the\r\ngreater will be the effect of their gravitation in resisting the\r\ncentrifugal force.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the ball at P will have a greater tendency to\r\nfall by gravitation towards O than it would have at _p_, because\r\nthe acclivity of the arch descending towards O at P is greater\r\nthan its acclivity at _p_. The gravitation, therefore, or tendency\r\nof the ball to fall towards the central axis being greater at P\r\nthan at _p_ it will be able to resist a greater centrifugal force.\r\nThis increased centrifugal force, which the ball would have\r\nrevolving at the distance P above what it would have at the\r\ndistance _p_, is produced partly by the greater distance of the\r\nball from the central axis, and partly by the greater velocity of\r\nits motion. But it will be evident that the time of its revolution\r\nmay nevertheless be the same, or nearly the same, at both\r\ndistances. If it should appear that the actual velocity of its\r\nmotion of revolution at P be greater than its velocity at _p_, in\r\nthe same proportion as the circles in which they revolve, then it\r\nis evident that the time of revolution would be as much increased\r\nby the greater space which P will have to travel over, as it will\r\nhave to be [Pg215] diminished by the greater speed with which\r\nthat space is traversed. The time of revolution, therefore, may be\r\nthe same, or nearly the same, in both cases.\r\n\r\nIf this explanation be comprehended, it will not be difficult to\r\napply it to the actual case of the governor. If a sudden increase\r\nof the energy of the moving power, or a diminution of the load,\r\nshould give the machine an increased velocity, then the increased\r\nspeed of the balls of the governor will give them an increased\r\ncentrifugal force, which for the moment will be greater than the\r\ntendency of their gravitation to make them fall towards the\r\nvertical axis. This centrifugal force, therefore, prevailing, the\r\nballs will recede from the axis; but as they recede, their\r\ngravitation towards the vertical axis will, as has been already\r\nexplained, be increased, and will become equal to the centrifugal\r\nforce produced by the increased velocity, provided that velocity\r\ndo not exceed a certain limit. When the balls, by diverging, get\r\nsuch increased gravitation as to balance the centrifugal force,\r\nthen they will continue to revolve at a fixed distance from the\r\nvertical axis. When this happens, the time of the revolution must\r\nbe nearly the same as it was before their increased divergence; in\r\nother words, the proportion of the moving power to the load will\r\nbe so restored by the action of the levers of the governor on the\r\nthrottle-valve that the machine will move at its former velocity,\r\nor nearly so.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which the governor acts, as just explained,\r\nnecessarily supposes temporary disarrangements of the speed. In\r\nfact, the governor, strictly speaking, does not maintain a uniform\r\nvelocity, but restores it after it has been disturbed. When a\r\nsudden change of motion of the engine takes place, the governor\r\nbeing immediately affected will cause a corresponding alteration\r\nin the throttle-valve; and this will not merely correct the change\r\nof motion, but it will, as it were, overdo it, and will cause a\r\nderangement of speed of the opposite kind. Thus if the speed be\r\nsuddenly increased to an undue amount, then the governor being\r\naffected will first close the throttle-valve too much, so as to\r\nreduce the speed below the proper limit. This second error will\r\nagain affect the governor in the contrary way, and the speed\r\n[Pg216] will again be increased rather too much. In this way a\r\nsuccession of alterations of effect will ensue until the governor\r\nsettles down into that position in which it will maintain the\r\nengine at the proper speed.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the inconvenience which would attend any excess of such\r\nvariations, the governor is made to act with great delicacy on the\r\nthrottle-valve, so that even a considerable change in the\r\ndivergence of the balls shall not produce too much alteration in\r\nthe opening of that valve: the steam in the boiler should have at\r\nleast 2 lbs. per square inch pressure more than is generally\r\nrequired in the cylinder. This excess is necessary to afford scope\r\nfor that extent of variation of the power which it is the duty of\r\nthe throttle-valve to regulate.\r\n\r\nThe governor is usually so adjusted as to make thirty-six\r\nrevolutions per minute, when in uniform motion; but if the motion\r\nis increased to the rate of thirty-nine revolutions, the balls\r\nwill fly to the utmost extent allowed them, being the limitation\r\nof the grooves in which their rods move; and if, on the other\r\nhand, the speed be diminished to thirty-four revolutions per\r\nminute, they will collapse to the lowest extent of their play. The\r\nduty of the governor, therefore, is to correct smaller casual\r\nderangements of the velocity; but if any permanent change to a\r\nconsiderable extent be made either in the load driven by the\r\nmachine or in the moving power supplied to it from the boiler,\r\nthen a permanent change is necessary to be made in the connection\r\nbetween the governor and the throttle-valve, so as to render the\r\ngovernor capable of regulating those smaller changes to which the\r\nspeed of the machine is liable.\r\n\r\n\r\n(127.) Having thus explained the principal mechanical contrivances\r\nprovided by Watt for the maintenance and regulation of the\r\nrotatory motion to be produced by his double-acting steam engine,\r\nlet us now consider the machine as a whole, and investigate the\r\nprocess of its operation. A section of this engine is represented\r\nin _fig._ 43.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 43.]\r\n\r\nSteam is supplied from the boiler to the cylinder by the steam\r\npipe S. The throttle-valve T in that pipe, near the cylinder, is\r\nregulated by a system of levers connected with [Pg217] the\r\ngovernor. The piston P is accurately fitted in the steam cylinder\r\nC by packing, as already described in the single-acting engine.\r\nThis piston, as it moves, divides the cylinder into two\r\ncompartments, between which there is no communication by which\r\nsteam or any other elastic fluid can pass. The upper steam box B\r\nis divided into three compartments by the two valves. Above the\r\nupper steam valve V is a compartment communicating with the steam\r\npipe; below the upper exhausting valve E is another compartment\r\ncommunicating with the eduction pipe which leads to the condenser.\r\nBy the valves V and E a communication may be opened or closed\r\nbetween the boiler on the one hand, or the condenser on the other,\r\nand the top of the cylinder. The continuation S′ of the steam pipe\r\nleads to the lower box B′, which, like the upper, is divided into\r\nthree compartments by two valves V′ and E′. The upper compartment\r\ncommunicates with the steam pipe, and thereby with the boiler; and\r\nthe lower compartment communicates with the eduction pipe, and\r\nthereby with the condenser. By means of the two valves V′ and E′,\r\na communication may be opened or closed between the steam pipe on\r\nthe one hand, or the exhausting pipe on the other, and the lower\r\npart of the cylinder. The four valves V, E, V′, and E′ are\r\nconnected by a system of levers with a handle or spanner _m_,\r\nwhich, being driven downwards or upwards, is capable of opening or\r\nclosing the valves in pairs, in the manner already described\r\n(116.). The condensers, the air-pump, and the hot-water pump, are\r\nin all respects similar to those already described in the\r\nsingle-acting engine, except that the condensing jet is governed\r\nby a lever I, by which it is allowed to play continually in the\r\ncondenser, and by which the quantity of water admitted through it\r\nis regulated. The cold-water pump N is worked by the engine as\r\nalready described in the single-acting engine, and supplies the\r\ncistern in which the air-pump and condenser are submerged, so as\r\nto keep down its temperature to the proper limit. On the air-pump\r\nrod R are two pins properly placed, so as to strike the spanner\r\n_m_, upwards and downwards, at the proper times, when the piston\r\napproaches the termination of the stroke at the top or bottom of\r\nthe cylinder. The pump L [Pg218] conducts the warm water drawn by\r\nthe air-pump from the condenser to a proper reservoir for feeding\r\nthe boiler. The vertical motion of the piston-rod in a straight\r\nline is rendered compatible with the circular motion of the end of\r\nthe beam by the parallel motion already described. The point _b_,\r\non the beam, moves upwards and downwards in a circular arch, of\r\nwhich the axis of the beam is the centre. In like manner the point\r\n_d_ of the rod _d c_ moves upwards and downwards, in a similar\r\narch of which the fixed pivot _c_ is the centre. The joint or bar\r\n_d b_, which joins these two pivots, will be moved so that its\r\nmiddle point _e_ will ascend and descend nearly in a straight\r\nline, as has been already explained (120.); [Pg219] opposite this\r\npoint _e_ is attached the piston-rod of the air-pump, which is\r\naccordingly guided upwards and downwards by this means. The\r\njointed parallelogram _b d g f_ is attached to the beam by pivots;\r\nand, as has been explained (120.), the point _g_ will be moved\r\nupwards and downwards in a straight line, through twice the space\r\nthrough which the point _e_ is moved. To the point _g_ the rod of\r\nthe steam piston is attached. Thus, the rods of the steam piston\r\nand air-pump are moved by the same system of jointed bars, and\r\nmoved through spaces which are in the proportion of two to one.\r\n\r\nAlthough this system of jointed rods forming the parallel motion,\r\nappears in the figure to consist only of one parallelogram _b d g\r\nf_, and one rod _c d_, called the _radius rod_, it is, in fact,\r\ndouble, a similar parallelogram and radius rod being attached to\r\ncorresponding points, and in the same manner on the other side of\r\nthe beam; but from the view given in the cut, the one set of rods\r\nhides the other. The two systems of rods thus attached to opposite\r\nsides of the beam at several inches asunder, are connected by\r\ncross rods, the ends of which form the pivots or joints, and\r\nextend between the parallelograms. The ends of these rods are only\r\nvisible in the figure. It is to the middle of one of these rods,\r\nthe end of which is represented at _e_, that the air-pump\r\npiston-rod is attached; and it is to the middle of another, the\r\nend of which is represented at _g_, that the steam piston-rod is\r\nattached. These two piston-rods, therefore, are driven, not\r\nimmediately by either of the parallelograms forming the parallel\r\nmotion, but by the bars extending between them.\r\n\r\nTo the working end of the beam H is attached a rod of cast-iron O,\r\ncalled the _connecting rod_, the lower end of which is attached to\r\nthe crank by a pivot. The weight of the connecting rod is so made,\r\nthat it shall balance the weight of the piston-rods of the air-pump\r\nand cylinder on the other side of the beam; and the weight of the\r\npiston-rod of the cold-water pump N nearly balances the weight of\r\nthe piston-rod of the hot-water pump L. Thus, so far as the weights\r\nof the machinery are concerned, the engine is in equilibrium, and\r\nthe piston would rest in any position indifferently in the cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe axis of the fly-wheel on which the crank is formed is [Pg220]\r\nsquare in the middle part, where the fly-wheel is attached to it,\r\nbut has cylindrical necks at each end, which rest in sockets or\r\nbearings supported by the framing of the machine, in which sockets\r\nthe axis revolves freely. On the axle of the crank is placed the\r\nfly-wheel, and connected with its axle is the governor Q, which\r\nregulates the throttle-valve T in the manner already described.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose the engine to be in full operation. The piston\r\nbeing at the top of the cylinder, the spanner _m_ will be raised\r\nby the lower pin on the air-pump rod, and the upper steam valve V,\r\nand the lower exhausting valve E′, will be opened, while the upper\r\nexhausting valve E and the lower steam valve V′ are closed. Steam\r\nwill, therefore, be admitted above the piston, and the steam which\r\nfilled the cylinder below it will be drawn off to the condenser,\r\nwhere it will be converted into water. The piston will, therefore,\r\nbe urged by the pressure of the steam above it to the bottom of\r\nthe cylinder. As it approaches that limit, the spanner _m_ will be\r\nstruck downwards by the upper pin on the air-pump rod, and the\r\nvalves V and E′ will be closed, and at the same time the lower\r\nsteam valve V′ and the upper exhausting valve E will be opened.\r\nSteam will, therefore, be admitted below the piston, while the\r\nsteam above it will be drawn off into the condenser, and converted\r\ninto water. The pressure of the steam, therefore, below the piston\r\nwill urge it upwards, and in the same manner the motion will be\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nWhile this process is going on in the cylinder and the condenser,\r\nthe water formed in the condenser will be gradually drawn off by\r\nthe operation of the air-pump piston, in the same manner as\r\nexplained in the single-acting engine; and at the same time the\r\nhot water thrown into the hot well by the air-pump piston will be\r\ncarried off by the hot-water pump L.\r\n\r\nSuch are the chief circumstances attending the continuance of the\r\noperation of the double-acting engine. It is only necessary here to\r\nrecall what has been already explained respecting the operation of\r\nthe fly-wheel. The commencement of the motion of the piston from the\r\ntop and bottom of the cylinder is produced, not by the pressure of\r\nthe steam upon it upwards or downwards, which must, for the reasons\r\n[Pg221] already explained, be entirely inefficient; but by the\r\nmomentum of the fly-wheel, which extricates the crank from those\r\npositions in which the moving power cannot affect it.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the motion of the crank affects the connecting\r\nrod at the dead points produces an effect of great importance in\r\nthe operation of the engine. When the crank-pin is approaching the\r\nlowest point of its play, and therefore the piston approaching the\r\ntop of the cylinder, the motion of the crank-pin becomes nearly\r\nhorizontal, and consequently its effect in drawing the connecting\r\nrod and the working end of the beam downwards and the piston\r\nupwards, is extremely small. The consequence of this is, that as\r\nthe piston approaches the top of the cylinder, its motion becomes\r\nvery rapidly retarded; and as the motion of the crank-pin at its\r\nlowest point is actually horizontal, the piston is brought to a\r\nstate of rest by this gradually retarded motion at the top of the\r\ncylinder. In like manner, when the crank-pin moves from its dead\r\npoint upwards, its motion at first is very nearly horizontal, and\r\nconsequently its effect in driving the working end of the beam\r\nupwards, and the piston downwards, is at first very small, but\r\ngradually accelerated. The effect of this upon the piston is, that\r\nit arrives at and departs from the top of the stroke with a very\r\nslow motion, being absolutely brought to rest at that point.\r\n\r\nThe same effect is produced when the piston arrives at the bottom\r\nof the cylinder. This retardation and suspension of the motion of\r\nthe piston at the termination of the stroke affords time for the\r\nprocess of condensation to be effected, so that when the moving\r\npower of the steam upon the piston can come into action, the\r\ncondensation shall be sufficiently complete. As the piston\r\napproaches the top of the cylinder, and its motion becomes slow,\r\nthe working gear is made to open the lower exhausting valve; the\r\nsteam enclosed in the cylinder below the piston, and which has\r\njust driven the piston upwards, presses with an elastic force of\r\n17 lbs. per square inch on every part of the interior of the\r\ncylinder, while the uncondensed vapour in the condenser presses\r\nwith a force of about 2 lbs. per square inch. The steam,\r\ntherefore, will have a tendency to rush from the cylinder to the\r\n[Pg222] condenser through the open exhausting valve, with an\r\nexcess of pressure amounting to 15 lbs. per square inch, while the\r\npiston pauses at the top of the cylinder. This process goes on,\r\nand when the piston has descended by the motion of the fly-wheel,\r\na sufficient distance from the top of the cylinder to call the\r\nmoving force of the steam into action, the exhaustion will be\r\ncomplete, and the pressure of the uncondensed vapour in the\r\ncylinder will become the same as in the condenser.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of steam in the cylinder, and of uncondensed vapour\r\nin the condenser, varies, within certain limits, in different\r\nengines, and therefore the amount here assigned to them must be\r\ntaken merely as an example.\r\n\r\nThe size of the valves by which the steam is allowed to pass from\r\nthe cylinder to the condenser should be such as to cause the\r\ncondensation to take place in a sufficiently short time, to be\r\ncompleted when the steam impelling the piston is called into\r\naction.\r\n\r\nWatt, in the construction of his engines, made the\r\nexhaustion-valves with a diameter which was one fifth of the\r\ndiameter of the cylinder, and therefore the actual magnitude of\r\nthe aperture for the escape of the steam was one twenty-fifth of\r\nthe magnitude of the cylinder; but the spindle of the valve\r\ndiminished this so that the available space for the escape of\r\nsteam did not exceed one twenty-seventh of the magnitude of the\r\ncylinder. This was found to produce a sufficiently rapid\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\nIt was usual to make the steam valves of the same magnitude as the\r\nexhausting valves, but the flow of steam through the former was\r\nresisted by the throttle-valve, while no obstruction was opposed\r\nto its passage through the latter.\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the cylinder must be exhausted by the\r\ncondenser will, however, depend upon the velocity with which the\r\npiston is moved in it. The magnitude, therefore, of the exhausting\r\nvalves which would be sufficient for an engine which acts with a\r\nslow motion would be too small where a rapid motion is required.\r\n\r\nIn the single-acting steam engine, where the moving force always\r\nacted downwards on the piston, the pressure upon [Pg223] all the\r\njoints of the machinery by which the force of the piston was\r\nconveyed to the working parts, always took place in the same\r\ndirection, and consequently whatever might be the mechanical\r\nconnection by which the several joints were formed, the pins by\r\nwhich they were connected, must always come to a bearing in their\r\nrespective sockets, however loosely they may have been fitted. For\r\nthe same reason, however, that the arch head and chain were\r\nabandoned as a means of connecting the steam piston with the beam,\r\nand the parallel motion substituted, it was also necessary in the\r\ndouble-acting engine, where all joints whatever were driven\r\nalternately in opposite directions, to fit the connecting pins\r\nwith the greatest accuracy in their sockets, and to abandon all\r\nconnection of the parts by chains. If any sensible looseness was\r\nleft in the joints, a violent jerk would be produced every time\r\nthe motion of the piston was reversed. Any looseness either in the\r\npivots or joints of the parallel motion of the working beam, the\r\nconnecting rod, or crank, would, at every change of stroke, be so\r\naccumulated as to produce upon the machinery the effects of\r\npercussion, and would consequently be attended with the danger of\r\nstraining and breaking the moveable parts of the mechanism.\r\n\r\nTo secure, therefore, the necessary accuracy of the joints, Watt\r\ncontrived that every joint in the engine should admit of the size of\r\nthe socket being exactly adapted to the size of the pin, so as\r\nalways to make a good fitting by closing the socket upon the pin,\r\nwhen any looseness would be produced by wear. With this view, all\r\nthe joints were fitted with sockets made of brass or gun-metal,\r\ncapable of adjustment. Each socket was composed of two pieces,\r\naccurately fitted into a cell or groove, in which one of the brasses\r\ncan be moved towards the other by means of a wedge or screw. Each\r\nbrass has in it a semi-cylindrical cavity, and the two cavities\r\nbeing opposed to each other, form a socket for the joint-pin. One of\r\nthe two brasses can always be tightened round that pin, so as to\r\nenclose it tight between the two semi-cylindrical cavities, and to\r\nprevent any looseness taking place. The brasses, and other parts of\r\nsuch a joint, are represented [Pg224] in _fig._ 44. These joints\r\nstill continue to be used in the engines as now constructed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 44.]\r\n\r\nThe motion of the working beam, and the pump-rods which it drives,\r\nand of the connecting rod, ought, if the whole were constructed\r\nwith perfect precision, to take place in the same or parallel\r\nvertical planes; but this supposes a perfection of execution which\r\ncould hardly have been expected in the early manufacture of such\r\nengines, whatever may have been attained by improvements which\r\nhave been since made. In the details of construction, Watt saw\r\nthat there would be a liability to lateral strain, owing to the\r\nplanes of the different motions not being truly vertical and truly\r\nparallel, and that if a provision were not made for such lateral\r\nmotion, the machinery would be subject to constant strain in its\r\njoints and rapid wear. He provided against this by constructing\r\nthe main joints by which the great working lever was connected\r\nwith the pistons and connecting rod, so as to form universal\r\njoints, giving freedom of motion laterally as well as vertically.\r\n\r\nThe great lever, or working beam, was so called from being\r\noriginally made from a beam of oak. It is now, however,\r\nuniversally constructed of cast-iron. The connecting rod is also\r\nmade of cast-iron, and attached to the beam and to the crank by\r\naxles or pivots.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism by which the four valves are opened and closed, is\r\nsubject to considerable variation in different engines. They have\r\nbeen described above as being opened and closed simultaneously by\r\na single lever. Sometimes, however, they are opened alternately in\r\npairs by two distinct levers driven by two pins attached to the\r\nair-pump rod. One pin strikes the lever, which opens and closes\r\nthe upper steam valve, and lower exhausting valve; the other\r\nstrikes that which opens and closes the lower steam valve and\r\nupper exhausting valve.\r\n\r\nSince the date of the earlier double-acting engines, constructed\r\nby Boulton and Watt, a great variety of mechanical expedients have\r\nbeen practised for working the valves, by which the steam is\r\nadmitted to and withdrawn from the [Pg225] cylinder. We shall\r\nhere describe a few of these methods:—\r\n\r\n\r\n(128.) The method of working the valves by pins on the air-pump\r\nrod driving levers connected with the valves has been, in almost\r\nall modern double-acting machines, superseded by an apparatus\r\ncalled an _eccentric_, by which the motion of the axle of the\r\nfly-wheel is made to open and close the valves at the proper\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 45.]\r\n\r\nAn eccentric is a metallic circle attached to a revolving axle, so\r\nthat the centre of the circle shall not coincide with the centre\r\nround which the axle revolves. Let us suppose that G (_fig._ 45.),\r\nis a square revolving shaft. Let a circular plate of metal B D,\r\nhaving its centre at C, have a square hole cut in it, corresponding\r\nto the shaft G, and let the shaft G pass through this square\r\naperture, so that the circular plate B D shall be fastened upon the\r\nshaft, and capable of revolving with it as the shaft revolves. The\r\ncentre C of the circular plate B D will be carried round the centre\r\nG of the revolving shaft, and will describe round it a circle, the\r\nradius of which will be the distance of the centre C of the circular\r\nplate from the centre of the shaft. Such circular plate so placed\r\nupon a shaft, and revolving with it, is _an eccentric_.\r\n\r\nLet E F be a metallic ring, formed of two semicircles of metal\r\nscrewed together at H, so as to be capable, by the adjustment of\r\nthe screws, of having the circular aperture formed by the ring\r\nenlarged and diminished within certain [Pg226] small limits. Let\r\nthis circular aperture be supposed to be equal to the magnitude of\r\nthe eccentric B D. To the circular ring E F let an arm L M be\r\nattached. If the ring E F be placed around the eccentric B D, and\r\nthat the screws H be so adjusted as to allow the eccentric B D to\r\nrevolve within the ring E F, then while the eccentric revolves,\r\nthe ring not partaking of its revolution, the arm L M will be\r\nalternately driven to the right and to the left, by the motion of\r\nthe centre C of the eccentric as it revolves round the centre G of\r\nthe axle. When the centre C of the eccentric is in the same\r\nhorizontal line with the centre G, and to the left of it, then the\r\nposition of L M will be that which is represented in _fig._ 45.;\r\nbut when, after half a revolution of the main axle, the centre C\r\nof the eccentric is thrown on the other side of the centre G, then\r\nthe point M will be transferred to the right, to a distance equal\r\nto twice the distance C G. Thus as the eccentric B D revolves\r\nwithin the ring E F, that ring, together with the arm L M, will be\r\nalternately driven, right and left, through a space equal to twice\r\nthe distance between the centre of the eccentric and the centre of\r\nthe revolving shaft.\r\n\r\nIf we suppose a notch formed at the extremity of the arm L M, which\r\nis capable of embracing a lever N M, moveable on a pivot at N, the\r\nmotion of the eccentric would give to such a lever an alternate\r\nmotion from right to left, and _vice versâ_. If we suppose another\r\nlever N O connected with N M, and at right angles to it, forming\r\nwhat is called a bell-crank, then the alternate motion received by\r\nM, from right to left, would give a corresponding motion to the\r\nextremity O of the lever N O, upwards and downwards. If this last\r\npoint O were attached to a vertical arm or shaft, it would impart to\r\nsuch arm or shaft an alternate motion upwards and downwards, the\r\nextent of which would be regulated by the length of the levers\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nBy such a contrivance the revolution of the fly-wheel shaft is\r\nmade to give an alternate vertical motion of any required extent\r\nto a vertical shaft placed near the cylinder, which may be so\r\nconnected with the valves as to open and close them. Since the\r\nupward and downward motion of this vertical shaft is governed by\r\nthe alternate motion of the centre [Pg227] C to the right and to\r\nthe left of the centre G, it is evident that by the adjustment of\r\nthe eccentric upon the fly-wheel shaft, the valves may be opened\r\nand closed at any required position of the fly-wheel and crank,\r\nand therefore at any required position of the piston in the\r\ncylinder.\r\n\r\nSuch is the contrivance by which the valves, whatever form may be\r\ngiven to them, are now almost universally worked in double-acting\r\nsteam engines.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving described the general structure and operation of the steam\r\nengine as improved by Watt, we shall now explain, in a more\r\ndetailed manner, some parts of its machinery which have been\r\nvariously constructed, and in which more or less improvements have\r\nbeen made.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE COCKS AND VALVES.\r\n\r\n\r\n(129.) In the steam engine, as well as in every other machine in\r\nwhich fluids act, it is necessary to open or close, occasionally,\r\nthe tubes or passages through which these fluids move. The\r\ninstruments by which this is accomplished are called cocks or\r\nvalves.\r\n\r\nCocks or valves may be classified by the manner in which they are\r\nopened: 1st, they may be opened by a motion similar to the lid of\r\na box upon its hinges; 2d, they may be opened by being raised\r\ndirectly upwards, in the same manner as the lid of a pot or\r\nkettle; 3d, they may be opened by a sliding motion, like that of\r\nthe sash of a window or the lid of a box which slides in grooves;\r\n4th, they may be opened by a motion of revolution, in the same\r\nmanner as the cock of a beer-barrel is opened or closed. The term\r\n_valve_ is more properly applied to the first and second of these\r\nclasses; the third class are usually called _slides_, and the\r\nfourth _cocks_.\r\n\r\n\r\n(130.) The single clack valve is the most simple example of the\r\nfirst class. It is usually constructed by attaching to a plate of\r\nmetal larger than the aperture which the valve is intended to\r\nstop, a piece of leather, and to the under side of this leather\r\nanother piece of metal smaller than the aperture. The leather\r\n[Pg228] extending on one side beyond the larger metallic plate,\r\nand being flexible, forms the hinge on which the valve plays. Such\r\na valve is usually closed by its own weight, and opened by the\r\npressure of the fluid which passes through it. It is also held\r\nclosed more firmly by the pressure of the fluid whose return it is\r\nintended to obstruct. An example of this valve occurs in the steam\r\nengine, in the passage between the condenser and the air-pump. The\r\naperture which it stops is there a seat inclined at an angle whose\r\ninclination is such as to render the weight of the valve\r\nsufficient to close it. In cases where the valve is exposed to\r\nheat, as in the example just mentioned, where it is continually in\r\ncontact with the hot water flowing from the condenser to the\r\nair-pump, the use of leather is inadmissible, and in that case the\r\nmetallic surface of the valve is ground smooth to fit its seat.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which such a valve should be capable of opening,\r\nought to be such that the aperture produced by it shall be equal\r\nto the aperture which it stops. This will be effected if the angle\r\nthrough which it rises be about 30°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 46.]\r\n\r\nThe valve by which the air and water collected in the bottom of\r\nthe air-pump are admitted to pass through the air-pump piston is a\r\ndouble clack, consisting of two semicircular plates, having the\r\nhinges on the diameters of these semicircles, as represented in\r\n_fig._ 46.\r\n\r\n\r\n(131.) Of the valves which are opened by a motion perpendicular to\r\ntheir seat, the most simple is a flat metallic plate, made larger\r\nthan the orifice which it is intended to stop, and ground so as to\r\nrest in steam-tight contact with the surface surrounding the\r\naperture. Such a valve is usually guided in its perpendicular\r\nmotion by a spindle passing through its centre, and sliding in\r\nholes made in cross bars extending above and below the seat of the\r\nvalve.\r\n\r\nThe conical steam-valves, which have been already described\r\n(116.), usually called spindle-valves, are the most common of this\r\nclass. The best angle to be given to the conical seat is found in\r\npractice to be 45°. With a less inclination the valve has a\r\ntendency to be fastened in its seat, and a greater inclination\r\nwould cause the top of the valve to occupy [Pg229] unnecessary\r\nspace in the valve-box. The area, or transverse section of the\r\nvalve-box, should be rather more than double the magnitude of the\r\nupper surface of the valve, in order to allow a sufficiently free\r\npassage for the steam, and the play of the valve should be such as\r\nto allow it to rise from its seat to a height not less than one\r\nfourth of the diameter of its upper surface.\r\n\r\nThe valves coming under this class are sometimes formed as spheres\r\nor hemispheres resting in a conical seat, and in such cases they\r\nare generally closed by their own weight, and opened by the\r\npressure of the fluid which passes through them.\r\n\r\n\r\n(132.) One of the advantages attending the use of slides, compared\r\nwith the other form of valves, is the simplicity with which the\r\nsame slide may be made to govern several passages, so that a\r\nsingle motion with a slide may perform the office of two or more\r\nmotions imparted to independent valves.\r\n\r\nIn most modern engines the passage of the steam to and from the\r\ncylinder is governed by slides of various forms, some of which we\r\nshall now explain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 47.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(133.) In _figs._ 47. and 48. is represented a slide-valve\r\ncontrived by Mr. Murray of Leeds. A B is a steam-tight case\r\nattached to the side of the cylinder; E F is a rod, which receives\r\nan alternate motion, upwards and downwards, from the eccentric, or\r\nfrom whatever other part of the engine is intended to move the\r\nslide. This rod, passing through a stuffing-box, moves the slide G\r\nupwards and downwards. S is the mouth of the steam pipe coming\r\nfrom the boiler; T is the mouth of a tube or pipe leading to the\r\ncondenser; H is a passage leading to the top, and I to the bottom,\r\nof the cylinder. In the position of the slide represented in\r\n_fig._ 47., the steam coming from the boiler through S passes\r\nthrough the space H to the top of the cylinder, while the steam\r\nfrom the bottom of the cylinder passes through the space I into\r\nthe tube T, and goes to the condenser. When the rod [Pg230] E F\r\nis raised to the position represented in _fig._ 48., then the\r\npassage H is thrown into communication with the tube T, while the\r\npassage I is made to communicate with the tube S. Steam,\r\ntherefore, passes from the boiler through I below the piston,\r\nwhile the steam which was above the piston, passing through H into\r\nT, goes to the condenser. Thus the single slide G performs the\r\noffice of the four valves described in (116.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 48.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(134.) The slide G has always steam of a full pressure behind it,\r\nwhile the steam in front of it escaping to the condenser, exerts\r\nbut little pressure upon it. It is therefore always forcibly\r\npressed against the surfaces in contact with which it moves, and\r\nis thereby maintained steam-tight. Indeed this pressure would\r\nrapidly wear the rubbing surfaces, unless they were made\r\nsufficiently extensive, and hardened so as to resist the effects\r\nof the friction. Where fresh water is used, as in land boilers,\r\nthe slide may be made of hardened steel; and in the case of marine\r\nboilers, it may be constructed of gun-metal. In this and all other\r\ncontrivances in which the apertures by which the steam is admitted\r\nto and withdrawn from the piston are removed to any considerable\r\ndistance from the top and bottom of the cylinder, there is a waste\r\nof steam, for the steam consumed at each stroke of the piston is\r\nnot only that which would fill the capacity of the cylinder, but\r\nalso the steam which fills the passage between the slide G and the\r\ntop or bottom of the cylinder. Any arrangement which would throw\r\nthe passages H and I on the other side of the slide G, that is,\r\nbetween S and G, instead of being, as they are, between G and the\r\ntop and bottom of the cylinder, would remove this defect. This is\r\naccomplished by a slide, which is usually called the D valve,\r\nbecause, being semi-cylindrical in its form, and hollow, its cross\r\nsection resembles the letter D. This slide, which is that which at\r\npresent is in most general use, is represented in _figs._ 49, 50.;\r\nE is the rod by which the slide is moved, passing [Pg231] through\r\na stuffing-box F; G G is the slide represented by a vertical\r\nsection, _a a_ being a passage in it extending from the top to the\r\nbottom; S is the mouth of the great steam pipe coming from the\r\nboiler; P is the pipe leading to the condenser; T H is a hollow\r\nspace formed in the slide always in communication with the steam\r\npipe S, and consequently always filled with steam from the boiler.\r\nA transverse section of the slide and cylinder is represented in\r\n_fig._ 51., where _a_ represents the top of the passage marked _a_\r\nin _fig._ 49. In the position of the slide represented in _fig._\r\n49., the steam filling the space T H has access to the top of the\r\ncylinder, but is excluded from the bottom. The steam which was\r\nbelow the piston, passing up the passage _a_, escapes through the\r\ntube P to the condenser. When the piston has descended, the rod E\r\nmoves the slide downwards, so as to give it the position\r\nrepresented in FIG. 50. The steam in T H has now access to the\r\nbottom of the cylinder, while the steam above the piston passing\r\nthrough P escapes to the condenser. In this way the operation of\r\nthe piston is continued and the steam consumed at each stroke only\r\nexceeds the capacity of the cylinder by what is necessary to fill\r\nthe passages between the slide and the cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 49.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 50.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 51.]\r\n\r\nIn a slide constructed in this manner, the steam filling the space\r\nT H has a tendency to press the slide back, so as to break the\r\ncontact of the rubbing surfaces, and thereby to cause the steam to\r\nleak from the space T H to the back of the slide. This is\r\ncounteracted by the packing _x_, at the back of the slide.\r\n\r\nIn engines of very long stroke, the extent of the rubbing surfaces\r\nof slides of this kind renders it difficult to keep [Pg232] them\r\nin steam-tight contact and to insure their uniform wear. In such\r\ncases, therefore, separate slides, upon the same principle, are\r\nprovided at the top and bottom of the cylinder, moved, however, by\r\na single rod of communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n(135.) In slides, as we have here described them, the same motion\r\nwhich admits steam to either end of the cylinder, withdraws it\r\nfrom the other end. Such an arrangement is only compatible with\r\nthe operation of a cylinder which works without expansion; for in\r\nsuch a cylinder the full flow of steam to the piston is only\r\ninterrupted for a moment during the change of position of the\r\nslide. But if the steam act expansively, it would be necessary to\r\nmove the slide, so as to stop its flow to one end of the cylinder,\r\nwithout at the same time obstructing the escape of steam from the\r\nother end to the condenser. It would therefore be necessary that\r\nthe slide should close the passage leading to the cylinder at one\r\nend, without at the same time obstructing the communication\r\nbetween the passage from the cylinder to the condenser at the\r\nother end. On the arrival of the piston, however, at the bottom of\r\nthe cylinder, it would be necessary immediately to put the lower\r\npassage to the cylinder in communication with the steam pipe, and\r\nthe upper passage in communication with the condenser. This would\r\nnecessarily suppose two motions of the slide as well as some\r\nmodifications in its length. Let the length of the slide be such\r\nthat when the passage to the top of the cylinder is stopped, the\r\nlower part of the slide shall not reach the passage to the lower\r\npart of the cylinder; and let such a provision be made in the\r\nmechanism by which the rod E governing the slide is driven that it\r\nshall receive two motions during the descent of the piston, the\r\nfirst to be imparted to it at the moment the steam is to be cut\r\noff, and the second just before the termination of the stroke. Let\r\nthe position of the slide, at the commencement of the stroke, be\r\nrepresented in _fig._ 52., and let it be required that the steam\r\nshall be cut off at one half of the stroke. When the piston has\r\nmade half the stroke, the rod governing the slide is moved\r\ndownwards, so as to throw the slide into the position represented\r\nin _fig._ 53. The passage between the steam pipe and the cylinder\r\nis [Pg233] now stopped at both ends; but the passage from the\r\nbottom of the cylinder to the condenser remains open. During the\r\nremainder of the stroke, therefore, the steam in the cylinder\r\nworks expansively. As the piston approaches the bottom of the\r\ncylinder, another motion is imparted to the rod governing the\r\nslide, by which the latter is thrown into the position represented\r\nin _fig._ 54. Steam now flows below the piston while the steam\r\nabove it passes to the condenser. In a similar manner, by two\r\nmotions successively imparted to the slide during the ascent of\r\nthe piston, the steam may be cut off at half stroke; and it is\r\nevident that by regulating the time at which these motions are\r\ngiven to the slide, the steam may be worked expansively, to any\r\nrequired extent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 52.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 53.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 54.]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to conceive various mechanical means by which, in the\r\nsame engine, the point at which the steam is cut off may be\r\nregulated at pleasure.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the motion of the piston is very rapid, as in\r\nlocomotive engines, it is desirable that the passages to and from\r\nthe cylinder should be opened very suddenly. This is difficult to\r\nbe accomplished with any form of slide consisting of a single\r\naperture; but if, instead of admitting the steam to the cylinder\r\nby a single aperture, the same magnitude of opening were divided\r\namong several apertures, then a proportionally less extent of\r\nmotion in the slide would clear the passage for the steam, and\r\nconsequently greater suddenness of opening would be effected.\r\n[Pg234]\r\n\r\nThe great advantages in the economy of fuel resulting from the\r\napplication of the expansive principle have, of late years forced\r\nthemselves on the attention of engineers, and considerable\r\nimprovements have been made in its application, especially in the\r\ncase of marine engines used for long voyages, in which the economy\r\nof fuel has become an object of the last importance. The mechanism\r\nby which expansive slides are moved, is made capable of adjustment,\r\nso that the part of the stroke at which the steam is cut off, can be\r\naltered at pleasure. The working power of the engine, therefore,\r\ninstead of being controlled by the throttle-valve, is regulated by\r\nthe greater or less extent to which the expansive principle is\r\napplied. Steam of the same pressure is admitted to the cylinder in\r\nall cases; but it is cut off at a greater or less portion of the\r\nstroke, according to the power which the engine is required to\r\nexert.\r\n\r\nThe last degree of perfection has been conferred on this principle\r\nby connecting the governor with the mechanism by which the slide\r\nis moved, so that the governor instead of acting on the\r\nthrottle-valve, is made to act upon the slide. By this means when,\r\nby reason of any diminution of the resistance, the motion of the\r\nengine is accelerated, the balls of the governor diverging shift\r\nthe cam or lever which governs the slide, so that the steam is cut\r\noff after a shorter portion of the stroke, the expansive principle\r\nis brought into greater play, and the quantity of steam admitted\r\nto the cylinder at each stroke is diminished. If, on the other\r\nhand, the resistance to the machine be increased, so as to\r\ndiminish the velocity of the engine, then the balls collapsing the\r\nlevers of the governor shift the cam which moves the slides, so as\r\nto increase the portion of the stroke made by the piston before\r\nthe steam is cut off, and thereby to increase the amount of\r\nmechanical power developed in the cylinder at each stroke. The\r\nextent to which the expansive principle is capable of being\r\napplied, more especially in marine engines, has been hitherto\r\nlimited by the necessity of using steam of very high pressure,\r\nwhenever the steam is cut off after the piston has performed only\r\na small part of the stroke. A method, however, is now (March,\r\n1840) under experimental trial, by [Pg235] Messrs. Maudsley and\r\nField, by which the expansive principle may be applied to any\r\nrequired extent without raising the steam in the boiler above the\r\nusual pressure of from three to five pounds per square inch. This\r\nmethod consists in the use of a piston of great magnitude. The\r\nforce urging the piston is thus obtained not by an excessive\r\npressure on a limited surface, but by a moderate pressure diffused\r\nover a large surface. The entire moving force acting on the piston\r\nbefore the steam is cut off, is considerably greater than the\r\nresistance; but during the remainder of the stroke this force is\r\ngradually enfeebled until the piston is brought to the extremity\r\nof its play.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 55.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(136.) Mr. Samuel Seaward, of the firm of Messrs. Seawards,\r\nengineers, has contrived an improved system of slides, for which\r\nhe has obtained a patent. A section of Seaward's slides is\r\nrepresented in _fig._ 55. The steam pipe proceeding from the\r\nboiler to the cylinder is represented at A A, and it communicates\r\nwith passages S and S′ leading to the top and bottom of the\r\ncylinder. These passages are formed in nozzles of iron or other\r\nhard metal cast upon the side of the cylinder. These nozzles\r\npresent a smooth face outwards, upon which the slides B B′, also\r\nformed with smooth faces, play. The slides B B′ are attached by\r\nknuckle-joints to rods E E′, which move through stuffing-boxes,\r\nand the [Pg236] connection of these rods with the slides is such\r\nthat the slides have play so as to detach their surfaces easily\r\nfrom the smooth surfaces of the nozzles when not pressed against\r\nthese surfaces. The steam in the steam pipe A A will press against\r\nthe backs of the slides B B′, and keep their faces in steam-tight\r\ncontact with the smooth surfaces of the nozzles. These slides may\r\nbe opened or closed by proper mechanism at any point of the\r\nstroke. When steam is to be admitted to the top of the cylinder,\r\nthe upper slide is raised and the passage S opened; and when it is\r\nto be admitted to the bottom of the cylinder, the lower slide is\r\nraised and the passage S′ opened; and its communication to the top\r\nor bottom of the cylinder is stopped by the lowering of these\r\nslides respectively. On the other side of the cylinder are\r\nprovided two passages C C′ leading to a pipe G, which is continued\r\nto the condenser. On this pipe are cast nozzles of iron or other\r\nmetal presenting smooth faces towards the cylinder, and having\r\npassages D D′ communicating between the top and bottom of the\r\ncylinder respectively and the pipe G G leading to the condenser.\r\nTwo slides _b b'_, having smooth faces turned from the cylinder,\r\nand pressing upon the faces of the nozzles D D′, are governed by\r\nrods playing through stuffing-boxes, in the same manner as already\r\ndescribed. The faces of these slides being turned from the\r\ncylinder, the steam in the cylinder having free communication with\r\nthem, has a tendency to keep them by its pressure in steam-tight\r\ncontact with the surfaces in which the apertures leading to the\r\ncondenser are formed. These two slides may be opened or closed\r\nwhenever it is necessary.\r\n\r\nWhen the piston commences its descent, the upper steam slide is\r\nraised, so as to open the passage S, and admit steam above the\r\npiston; and the lower exhausting slide _b′_ is also raised, so as\r\nto allow the steam below the piston to escape through G to the\r\ncondenser, the other two passages S′ and C being closed by their\r\nrespective slides. The slide which governs S is lowered at that\r\npart of the stroke at which the steam is intended to be cut off,\r\nthe other slides remaining unchanged; and when the piston has\r\nreached the bottom of the cylinder, the lower steam slide opens\r\nthe passage S′, and [Pg237] the upper exhausting slide opens the\r\npassage C; and at the same time the lower exhausting slide closes\r\nthe passage C′. Steam being admitted below the piston through S′,\r\nand at the same time the steam above it being drawn away to the\r\ncondenser through the open passage C and the tube G, the piston\r\nascends. When it has reached that point at which the steam is\r\nintended to be cut off, the slide which governs S′ is lowered, the\r\nother slides remaining unaltered, and the upward stroke is\r\ncompleted in the same manner as the downward.\r\n\r\nThese four slides may be governed by a single lever, or they may\r\nbe moved by separate means. From the small spaces between the\r\nseveral slides and the body of the cylinder, it will be evident\r\nthat the waste of steam by this contrivance will be very small.\r\n\r\nIn the slide valves commonly used, the packing of hemp at the back\r\nof the slide, by which the pressure necessary to keep the slide in\r\nsteam-tight contact is obtained, requires constant attention from\r\nthe engine-man while the engine is at work. Any neglect of this\r\nwill produce a corresponding loss in the power of the engine; and\r\naccordingly it is found that in many cases where engines work\r\ninefficiently, the defect is owing either to ignorance or want of\r\nattention on the part of the engine-man in the packing of the\r\nslides. In Seaward's slides no hemp packing is used, nor is any\r\nattention on the part of the engine-man required after the slides\r\nare first adjusted. The slides receive the pressure necessary to\r\nkeep them in steam-tight contact with the surfaces of the nozzles\r\nfrom the steam itself, which acts behind them.\r\n\r\nThe eduction and steam slides being independent of each other,\r\nthey may be adjusted so that the engine shall work expansively in\r\nany required degree; and this may be accomplished either by\r\nworking the slides by separate mechanism, or by a single\r\neccentric.\r\n\r\nOne of the advantages claimed by the patentees for these slides\r\nis, that the engines are secured from the accidents which arise\r\nfrom the accumulation of water within the steam cylinder. If such\r\na circumstance should occur, the action of the piston will press\r\nthe water against the faces of the steam [Pg238] slides, and the\r\nplay allowed to them by their connection with the rods which move\r\nthem permits their faces to be raised from the surfaces of the\r\nnozzles, so that the water collected in the cylinder shall be\r\ndriven into the steam pipe, and sent back from thence to the\r\nboiler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 56.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 57.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 58.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(137.) Of the cocks or valves which are opened and closed by the\r\nmotion of an axis passing through their centre, the throttle-valve,\r\nwhether worked by hand or by the governor, is an example. But the\r\nmost common form for cocks is that of a cylindrical or slightly\r\nconical plug (_fig._ 56.), inserted in an aperture of corresponding\r\nmagnitude passing across the pipe or passage which the cock is\r\nintended to open or close. One or more holes are pierced\r\ntransversely in the cock, and when the cock is turned so that these\r\nholes run in the direction of the tube, the passage through the tube\r\nis opened; but when the passage through the cock is placed at right\r\nangles to the tube, then the sides of the tube stop the ends of the\r\npassage in the cock, and the passage through the tube is obstructed.\r\nThe simple cock is designed to open or close the passage through a\r\nsingle tube. When the cock is turned, as in _fig._ 57., so that the\r\npassage through the cock shall be at right angles to the length of\r\nthe tube, then the passage through the tube is stopped; but when the\r\ncock is turned from that position through a quarter of a revolution,\r\nas in _fig._ 58., then the passage through the cock takes the\r\ndirection of the passage through the tube, and the cock is opened,\r\nand the passage through the tube unobstructed. In such a cock the\r\npassage may be more or less _throttled_ by [Pg239] adjusting the\r\nposition of the cock, so that a part of the opening in it shall be\r\ncovered by the side of the tube.\r\n\r\n\r\n(138.) It is sometimes required to put one tube or passage\r\nalternately in communication with two others. This is accomplished\r\nby a _two-way cock_. In this cock the passage is curved, opening\r\nusually at points on the surface of the cock, at right angles to\r\neach other. Such a cock has already been described, and its use\r\nillustrated in the description of the Marquis of Worcester's\r\nengine (17.); the two-way cock, as represented at K and R (_fig._\r\n4.), being the means by which steam and water are alternately\r\nsupplied to the two forcing vessels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 59.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 60.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(139.) When it is required to put four passages alternately in\r\ncommunication by pairs, a _four-way cock_ is used. Such a cock has\r\ntwo curved passages (_fig. 59._), each similar to the curved\r\npassage in the two-way cock. Let S C B T be the four tubes which\r\nit is required to throw alternately into communication by pairs.\r\nWhen the cock is in the position _fig._ 59., the tube S\r\ncommunicates with T, and the tube C with B. By turning the cock\r\nthrough a quarter of a revolution, as in _fig._ 60., the tube S is\r\nmade to communicate with B, and the tube C with T; and if the cock\r\ncontinue to be turned at intervals through a quarter of a\r\nrevolution, these changes of communication will continue to be\r\nalternately made. It is evident that this may be accomplished by\r\nturning the cock continually in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe four-way cock is sometimes used as a substitute for the valves\r\nor slides in a double-acting steam engine to conduct the steam to\r\nand from the cylinder. If S represent a pipe conducting steam from\r\nthe boiler, C that which leads to the condenser, T the tube which\r\nleads to the top of the cylinder, and B that which leads to the\r\nbottom, then when the cock is in the position (_fig._ 59.), steam\r\nwould flow from the boiler to [Pg240] the top of the piston,\r\nwhile the steam below it would be drawn off to the condenser; and\r\nin the position (_fig._ 60.), steam would flow from the boiler to\r\nthe bottom of the piston, while the steam above it would be drawn\r\noff to the condenser. Thus by turning the cock through a quarter\r\nof a revolution towards the termination of each stroke, the\r\noperation of the machine would be continued.\r\n\r\nOne of the disadvantages which is inseparable from the use of a\r\nfour-way cock for this purpose is the loss of the steam at each\r\nstroke, which fills the tubes between the cock and the ends of the\r\ncylinder. This disadvantage could only be avoided by the\r\nsubstitution of two two-way cocks (138.) instead of a four-way\r\ncock. A two-way cock at the top of the cylinder would open an\r\nalternate communication between the cylinder and steam pipe, and\r\nthe cylinder and condenser, while a similar office would be\r\nperformed by another two-way cock at the other end.\r\n\r\nThe friction on cocks of this description is more than on other\r\nvalves; but this is in some degree compensated by the great\r\nsimplicity of the instrument. When the cock is truly ground into\r\nits seat, being slightly conical in its form, the pressure of the\r\nsteam has a tendency to keep the surfaces in contact; but this\r\npressure also increases the friction, and has a tendency to wear\r\nthe seat of the cock into an elliptical shape. Consequently, such\r\ncocks require to be occasionally ground and refitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n(140.) The four-way cock, as above described, admits the steam to\r\none end of the piston at the same moment that it stops it at the\r\nother end. It would therefore be inapplicable where steam is\r\nworked expansively. A slight modification, however, analogous to\r\nthat already described in the slides, will adapt it to expansive\r\naction. This will be accomplished by giving to one of the passages\r\nthrough the cock one aperture larger than the other, and working\r\nthe cock so that this passage shall always be used to conduct\r\nsteam to the cylinder; also by enlarging both apertures of the\r\nother passage, and using it always to conduct steam from the\r\ncylinder. The effect of such an arrangement will be readily\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 61.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 62.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 63.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 64.]\r\n\r\nLet the position of the cock at the commencement of the [Pg241]\r\ndescending stroke be represented in _fig._ 61. Steam flows from S\r\nthrough T to the top of the cylinder, while it escapes from B\r\nthrough C from the bottom of the cylinder. When the piston has\r\narrived at that point at which the steam is to be cut off, let the\r\ncock be shifted to the position represented in _fig._ 62. The\r\npassage of steam from the boiler is now stopped, but the escape of\r\nsteam from the bottom of the cylinder through C continues, and the\r\ncock is maintained in this position until the piston approaches\r\nthe bottom of the cylinder, when it is further shifted to the\r\nposition represented in _fig._ 63. Steam now flows from S through\r\nB to the bottom of the cylinder, while the steam from the top of\r\nthe cylinder escapes through C to the condenser. When the piston\r\nhas arrived at that point where the steam is to be cut off, the\r\ncock is shifted to the position represented in _fig._ 64. The\r\ncommunication between the steam and the bottom of the piston is\r\nnow stopped, while the communication between the top of the\r\ncylinder and the condenser is still open. During the next double\r\nstroke of the piston the position of the cock is similarly\r\nchanged, but in the contrary direction, and in the same way the\r\nmotion is continued. Under these circumstances the cock, instead\r\n[Pg242] of being moved constantly in the same direction, as in the\r\ncase of the common four-way cock, will require to be moved\r\nalternately in opposite directions.\r\n\r\n\r\nPISTONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(141.) The office of a piston being to divide a cylinder into two\r\ncompartments by a movable partition which shall obstruct the passage\r\nof any fluid from one compartment to the other, it is evident that\r\nthe two conditions which such an instrument ought to fulfil are,\r\n_first_, that the contact of its sides with the surface of the\r\ncylinder shall be so close and tight throughout its entire play that\r\nno steam or other fluid can pass between them; _secondly_, that it\r\nshall be so free from friction, notwithstanding this necessary\r\ntightness, that it shall not absorb any injurious quantity of the\r\nmoving power.\r\n\r\nSince, however accurately the surfaces of the piston and cylinder\r\nmay be constructed, there will always be in practice more or less\r\nimperfection of form, it is evident that the contact of the\r\nsurface of the piston with the cylinder throughout the stroke can\r\nonly be maintained by giving to the circumference of the piston\r\nsufficient elasticity to accommodate itself to such inequalities\r\nof form. The substance, whatever it may be, used for this purpose,\r\nand by which the piston is surrounded, is called _packing_.\r\n\r\nIn steam pistons the material used for packing must be such as is\r\ncapable of resisting the united effects of heat and moisture.\r\nHence leather and other animal substances are inapplicable.\r\n\r\nThe packing used for steam pistons is therefore of two kinds,\r\n_vegetable packing_, usually hemp, or _metallic packing_.\r\n\r\nThe common hemp-packed piston has been already in part described\r\n(79.). The bottom of the piston is a circular plate just so much\r\nless in diameter than the cylinder as is sufficient to allow its\r\nfree motion in ascending and descending. A little above its lowest\r\npoint this plate begins gradually to diminish in thickness, until\r\nits diameter is reduced to from one to two inches less than that\r\nof the cylinder, leaving therefore around [Pg243] it a hollow\r\nspace, as represented in _fig._ 65. The cover of the piston is a\r\nplate similarly formed, being in like manner gradually reduced in\r\nthickness downwards, so as to correspond with the lower plate. In\r\nthe hollow space which thus surrounds the piston a packing of\r\nunspun hemp or soft rope, called _gasket_, is introduced by\r\nwinding it round the piston so as to render it an even and compact\r\nmass. When the space is thus filled up, the top of the piston is\r\nattached to the bottom by screws. The curved form of the space\r\nwithin which the hempen packing is confined is such that when the\r\nscrews are tightened, that part of the packing which is nearest to\r\nthe top and bottom of the piston is forced against the cylinder,\r\nso as to produce upon the two parallel rings as much pressure as\r\nis necessary to render it steam-tight. When by use the packing is\r\nworn down so as to produce leakage, the cover of the cylinder must\r\nbe removed, and the screws connecting the top and bottom of the\r\npiston tightened: this will force out the packing and render the\r\npiston steam-tight. This packing is lubricated by melted tallow\r\nlet down upon the piston from the funnel inserted in the top of\r\nthe cylinder, furnished with a stop-cock to prevent the escape of\r\nsteam. The lower end of the piston-rod is formed slightly conical,\r\nthe thickest part of the cone being downward. It is passed up\r\nthrough the piston, and a nut or wedge between the top and bottom\r\nis inserted so as to secure the piston in its position upon the\r\nrod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 65.]\r\n\r\nThe process of removing the top of the cylinder for the purpose of\r\ntightening the screws in the piston is one of so laborious a\r\nnature, that the men entrusted with the superintendence of these\r\nmachines are tempted to allow the engine to work notwithstanding\r\ninjurious leakage at the piston, rather than incur the labour of\r\ntightening the screws as often as it is necessary to do so.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this inconvenience, the following method of [Pg244]\r\ntightening the packing of the piston without removing the lid of\r\nthe cylinder, was contrived by Woolf. The head of each of the\r\nscrews was formed into a toothed pinion, and as these screws were\r\nplaced at equal distances from the centre of the piston, these\r\nseveral pinions were driven by a large toothed wheel, revolving on\r\nthe piston-rod as an axis. By such an arrangement it is evident\r\nthat if any one of the screws be turned, a like motion will be\r\nimparted to all the others through the medium of the large central\r\nwheel. Woolf accordingly formed, on the head of one of the screws,\r\na square end. When the piston was brought to the top of the\r\ncylinder, this square end entered an aperture made in the under\r\nside of the cover of the cylinder. This aperture was covered by a\r\nsmall circular piece screwed into the top of the cylinder, which\r\nwas capable of being removed so as to render the square head of\r\nthe screw accessible. When this was done, a proper key being\r\napplied to the square head of the screw, it was turned; and by\r\nbeing turned, all the other screws were in like manner moved. In\r\nthis way, instead of having to remove the cover of the cylinder,\r\nwhich in large cylinders was attended with great labour and loss\r\nof time, the packing was tightened by merely unscrewing a piece in\r\nthe top of the cylinder not much greater in magnitude than the\r\nhead of one of the screws.\r\n\r\nThis method was further simplified by causing the great circular\r\nwheel already described to move upon the piston-rod, not as an\r\naxis, but as a screw, the thread being cut upon a part of the\r\npiston-rod which worked in a corresponding female screw cut upon\r\nthe central plate. By such means, the screw whose head was let\r\ninto the cover of the cylinder which turned, would cause this\r\ncircular plate to be pressed downwards by the force of the screw\r\nconstructed on the piston-rod. This circular plate thus pressed\r\ndownwards, acted upon pins or plugs which pressed together the top\r\nand bottom of the cylinder in the same manner as they were pressed\r\ntogether by the screws connecting them as already described.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETALLIC PISTONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n(142.) The notion of constructing a piston so as to move\r\nsteam-tight in the cylinder without the use of packing of\r\nvegetable [Pg245] matter was first suggested by the Rev. Mr.\r\nCartwright, a gentleman well known for other mechanical\r\ninventions. A patent was granted in 1797 for a new form of steam\r\nengine, in which he proposed to use the vapour of alcohol to work\r\nthe piston instead of the steam of water: and since the principle\r\nof the engine excluded the use of lubrication by oil or tallow, he\r\nsubstituted a piston formed of metallic rings pressed against the\r\nsurface of the cylinder by springs, so as to be maintained in\r\nsteam-tight contact with it, independently either of packing or\r\nlubrication. Although the engine for which this form of piston was\r\nintended never came into practical use, yet it is so simple and\r\nelegant in its structure, and forms a link so interesting in the\r\nhistory of the steam engine, that some explanation of it ought not\r\nto be omitted in this work.\r\n\r\nThe steam-pipe from the boiler is represented cut off at B (_fig._\r\n66.); T is a spindle-valve, for admitting steam above the piston,\r\nand R is a spindle-valve in the piston; D is a curved pipe forming\r\na communication between the cylinder and the condenser, which is\r\nof very peculiar construction. Cartwright proposed effecting a\r\ncondensation without a jet, by exposing the steam to contact with\r\na very large quantity of cold surface. For this purpose, he formed\r\nhis condenser by placing two cylinders nearly equal in size, one\r\nwithin the other, allowing the water of the cold cistern in which\r\nthey were placed to flow through the inner cylinder, and to\r\nsurround the outer one. Thus, the thin space between the two\r\ncylinders formed the condenser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 66.]\r\n\r\nThe air-pump is placed immediately under the cylinder, and the\r\ncontinuation of the piston-rod works its piston, which is solid\r\nand without a valve. F is the pipe from the condenser to the\r\nair-pump, through which the condensed steam is drawn off through\r\nthe valve G on the ascent of the piston, and on the descent this\r\nis forced through a tube into a hot well H, for the purpose of\r\nfeeding the boiler through the feed-pipe I. In the top of the hot\r\nwell H is a valve which opens inwards, and is kept closed by a\r\nball floating on the surface of the liquid. The pressure of the\r\ncondensed air above the surface of the liquid in H forces it\r\nthrough I into the boiler. When the air accumulates in too great a\r\ndegree [Pg246] in H, the surface of the liquid is pressed so low\r\nthat the ball falls and opens the valve, and allows it to escape.\r\nThe air in H is that which is pumped from the condenser with the\r\nliquid, and from which it was disengaged.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose the piston at the top of the cylinder: it strikes\r\nthe tail of the valve T, and raises it, while the stem of the\r\npiston-valve R strikes the top of the cylinder, and is pressed\r\ninto its seat. A free communication is at the same time open\r\nbetween the cylinder, below the piston and the condenser, through\r\nthe tube D. The pressure of the steam [Pg247] thus admitted above\r\nthe piston acting against the vacuum below it, will cause its\r\ndescent. On arriving at the bottom of the cylinder, the tail of\r\nthe piston-valve R will strike the bottom, and it will be lifted\r\nfrom its seat, so that a communication will be opened through it\r\nwith the condenser. At the same moment, a projecting spring K,\r\nattached to the piston-rod, strikes the stem of the steam-valve T,\r\nand presses it into its seat. Thus while the further admission of\r\nsteam is cut off, the steam above the piston flows into the\r\ncondenser, and the piston being relieved from all pressure, is\r\ndrawn up by the momentum of the fly-wheel, which continues the\r\nmotion it received from the descending force. On the arrival of\r\nthe piston again at the top of the cylinder, the valve T is opened\r\nand R closed, and the piston descends as before, and so the\r\nprocess is continued.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism by which motion is communicated from the piston to\r\nthe fly-wheel is peculiarly elegant. On the axis of the fly-wheel\r\nis a small wheel with teeth, which work in the teeth of another\r\nlarger wheel L. This wheel is turned by a crank, which is worked\r\nby a cross-piece attached to the end of the piston-rod. Another\r\nequal-toothed wheel M is turned by a crank, which is worked by the\r\nother end of the cross-arm attached to the piston-rod.\r\n\r\nOne of the peculiarities of this engine is, that the liquid which\r\nis used for the production of steam in the boiler circulates\r\nthrough the machine without either diminution or admixture with\r\nany other fluid, so that the boiler never wants more feeding than\r\nwhat can be supplied from the hot well H. This circumstance forms\r\nan important feature in the machine, as it allows of ardent\r\nspirits being used in the boiler instead of water, which, since\r\nthey boil at low heats, promised a saving of fuel. The inventor\r\nproposed that the engine should be used as a still, as well as a\r\nmechanical power, in which case the whole of the fuel would be\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 67.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 68.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(143.) That part of Cartwright's piston which in the common piston\r\nis occupied by the packing of gasket, already explained (141.),\r\nwas filled by a number of rings, one placed within and above\r\nanother, and divided into three or four [Pg248] segments. Two\r\nrings of brass were made of the full size of the cylinder, and so\r\nground as to fit the cylinder nearly steam-tight. These were cut\r\ninto several segments A A A (_fig._ 67.), and were placed one\r\nabove the other, so as to fill the space between the top and\r\nbottom plates of the piston. The divisions of the segments of the\r\none ring were made to fit between the divisions of the other.\r\nWithin these another series of rings, B B B, were placed,\r\nsimilarly constructed, so as to fit within the first series in the\r\nsame manner as the first series were made to fit within the\r\ncylinder. The joints of the upper series of each set of rings are\r\nexhibited in the plan (_fig._ 67.); the places of the joints of\r\nthe lower series are shown by dotted lines; the position of the\r\nrings of each series one above the other is shown in the section\r\n(_fig._ 68.). The joints of the inner series of rings are so\r\nplaced as to lie between those of the outer series, to prevent the\r\nescape of steam which would take place by one continued joint from\r\ntop to bottom of the packing. The segments into which the rings\r\nare divided are pressed outwards by steel springs in the form of\r\nthe letter V, the springs which act upon the outer series of\r\nsegments abutting upon the inner series, and those which act on\r\nthe inner series abutting upon the solid centre of the piston:\r\nthese springs are represented in _fig._ 67.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 69.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 70.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(144.) An improved form was given to the metallic piston by\r\nBarton. Barton's piston consists of a solid cylinder of cast iron,\r\nrepresented at A in section in _fig._ 69., and in plan in [Pg249]\r\n_fig._ 70. In the centre of this is a conical hole, increasing in\r\nmagnitude downwards, to receive the piston-rod, in which the\r\nlatter is secured by a cross-pin B. A deep groove, square in its\r\nsection, is formed around the piston, so that while the top and\r\nbottom of the piston form circles equal in magnitude to the\r\nsection of the cylinder, the intermediate part of the body of the\r\npiston forms a circle less than the former by the depth of the\r\ngroove. Let a ring of brass, cast iron, or cast steel, be made to\r\ncorrespond in magnitude and form with this groove, and let it be\r\ndivided as represented in _fig._ 70., into four segments C C C C,\r\nand four corresponding angular pieces D D D D. Let the groove\r\nwhich surrounds the piston be filled by the four segments with the\r\nfour wedge-like angular pieces within them, and let the latter be\r\nurged against the former by eight spiral springs, as represented\r\nin _fig._ 69. and _fig._ 70. These springs will abut against the\r\nsolid centre by the piston, and will urge the segments C against\r\nthe cylinder. The spiral springs which urge the wedges are\r\nconfined in their action by steel pins which pass through their\r\ncentre, and by being [Pg250] confined in cylindrical cavities\r\nworked into the wedges and into corresponding parts of the solid\r\ncentre of the piston, as the segments C wear, the springs urge the\r\nwedges outwards, and the points of the latter protruding, are\r\ngradually worn down so as to fill up the spaces left between the\r\nsegments, and thus to complete the outer surface of the piston.\r\n\r\nVarious other forms of metallic pistons have been proposed, but as\r\nthey do not differ materially in principle from those we have just\r\ndescribed, it will not be necessary here to describe them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENGINE AT THE CITY SAW MILLS.]\r\n\r\n[Pg251]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FURNACE AT THE CITY SAW MILLS.]\r\n\r\nCHAP.

The machinery which has been explained in the preceding\r\nchapters, consisting of the cylinder with its passages and valves,\r\nthe piston-rod, parallel motion, beam, connecting-rod and crank,\r\ntogether with the condenser, air-pump, and other appendages,\r\nhaving no source of moving power in themselves, must be regarded\r\nas mere instruments by which the mechanical effect developed by\r\nthe furnace and the boiler is transmitted to the working point and\r\nso [Pg252] modified as to be adapted to the uses to which the\r\nmachine is applied. The boiler is at once a magazine in which the\r\nmoving power is stored in sufficient quantity to supply the\r\ndemands of the engine and an apparatus in which that power is\r\nfabricated. The mechanical effect evolved in the conversion of\r\nwater into steam by heat, is the process by which the power of the\r\nsteam-engine is produced, and space is provided in the boiler,\r\ncapacious enough to contain as much steam as is necessary for the\r\nengine, besides a sufficient quantity of water to continue that\r\nsupply undiminished, notwithstanding the constant drafts made upon\r\nit by the cylinder: even the water itself, from the evaporation of\r\nwhich the mechanical power is produced, ought to be regarded as an\r\ninstrument by which the effect of the heat of the combustible is\r\nrendered mechanically efficient, inasmuch as the same heat,\r\napplied not only to other liquids but even to solids, would\r\nlikewise be productive of mechanical effects. The boiler and its\r\nfurnace are therefore parts of the steam-engine, the construction\r\nand operation of which are entitled to especial attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n(146.) COAL, the combustible almost universally used in\r\nsteam-engines, is a substance, the principal constituents of which\r\nare _carbon_ and _hydrogen_, occasionally mixed with sulphur in a\r\nsmall proportion, and earthy incombustible matter. In different\r\nsorts of coal the proportions of these constituents vary, but in\r\ncoal of good quality about three quarters of the whole weight of\r\nthe combustible is carbon.\r\n\r\nWhen carbon is heated to a temperature of about 700° in an\r\natmosphere of pure oxygen, it will combine chemically with that\r\ngas, and the product will be the gas called _carbonic acid_. The\r\nvolume of carbonic acid produced by this combination, will be\r\nexactly equal to that of the oxygen combined with the carbon, and\r\ntherefore the weight of a given volume of the gas will be\r\nincreased by the weight of carbon which enters the combination. It\r\nis found that two parts by weight of oxygen combined with three of\r\ncarbon, form carbonic acid. The weight of the carbonic acid,\r\ntherefore, produced in the combustion, will be greater than the\r\nweight of the oxygen, bulk for bulk, in the proportion of five to\r\ntwo, the volume being the same and the gases being [Pg253]\r\ncompared at the same temperatures and under equal pressures. In\r\nthis combination heat is evolved in very large quantities. This\r\neffect arises from the heat previously latent in the carbon and\r\noxygen being rendered sensible in the process of combustion. The\r\ncarbonic acid proceeding from the combustion is by such means\r\nraised to a very high temperature, and the carbon during the\r\nprocess acquires a heat so intense as to become luminous; no\r\nflame, however, is produced.\r\n\r\nHydrogen, heated to a temperature of about 1000°, in contact with\r\noxygen will combine with the latter, and a great evolution of heat\r\nwill attend the process; the gases will be rendered luminous, and\r\nflame will be produced. The product of this process will be water,\r\nwhich being exposed to the intense heat of combustion, will be\r\nimmediately converted into steam. Hydrogen combines with eight\r\ntimes its own weight of oxygen, producing nine times its own\r\nweight of water.\r\n\r\nHydrogen gas is, however, not usually disengaged from coal in a\r\nsimple form, but combined chemically with a certain portion of\r\ncarbon, the combination being called carburetted hydrogen. Pure\r\nhydrogen burns with a very faintly luminous blue flame, but\r\ncarburetted hydrogen gives that bright flame occasionally having\r\nan orange or reddish tinge, which is seen to issue from burning\r\ncoals: this is the gas used for illumination, being expelled from\r\nthe coal by the process of coking, and conducted to the various\r\nburners through proper pipes.\r\n\r\nThe sulphur, which in a very small proportion is contained in\r\ncoals, is also combustible, and combines in the process of\r\ncombustion with oxygen, forming sulphurous acid: it is also\r\nsometimes evolved in combination with hydrogen, forming\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric air consists of two gases, azote and oxygen, mixed\r\ntogether in the proportion of four to one; five cubic feet of\r\natmospheric air consisting of four cubic feet of azote and one of\r\noxygen. Any combustible will combine with the oxygen contained in\r\natmospheric air, if raised to a temperature somewhat higher than\r\nthat which is necessary to cause its combustion in an atmosphere\r\nof pure oxygen.\r\n\r\nIf coals, therefore, or other fuel exposed to atmospheric [Pg254]\r\nair, be raised to a sufficiently high temperature, their\r\ncombustible constituents will combine with the oxygen of the\r\natmospheric air, and all the phenomena of combustion will ensue.\r\nIn order, however, that the combustion should be continued, and\r\nshould be carried on with quickness and activity, it is necessary\r\nthat the carbonic acid, and other products, should be removed from\r\nthe combustible as they are produced, and fresh portions of\r\natmospheric air brought into contact with it; otherwise the\r\ncombustible would soon be surrounded by an atmosphere composed\r\nchiefly of carbonic acid to the exclusion of atmospheric air, and\r\ntherefore of uncombined oxygen, and consequently the combustion\r\nwould cease, and the fuel be extinguished. To maintain the\r\ncombustion, therefore, a current of atmospheric air must be\r\nconstantly carried through the fuel: the quantity and force of\r\nthis current must depend on the quantity and quality of the fuel\r\nto be consumed. It must be such that it shall supply sufficient\r\noxygen to the fuel to maintain the combustion, and not more than\r\nsufficient, since any excess would be attended with the effect of\r\nabsorbing the heat of combustion, without contributing to the\r\nmaintenance of that effect.\r\n\r\nHeat is communicated from body to body in two ways, by radiation\r\nand by contact.\r\n\r\nRays of heat issue from a heated body, and are dispersed through\r\nthe surrounding space in a manner, and according to laws, similar\r\nto those which govern the radiation of light. The heat thus\r\nradiated meeting other bodies is imparted to them, and penetrates\r\nthem with more or less facility according to their physical\r\nqualities.\r\n\r\nA heated body also brought into contact with another body of lower\r\ntemperature, communicates heat to that other body, and will\r\ncontinue to do so until the temperature of the two bodies in\r\ncontact shall be equalised. Heat proceeds from fuel in a state of\r\ncombustion in both these ways: the heated fuel radiates heat in\r\nall directions around it, and the heat thus radiated will be\r\nimparted to all parts of the furnace which are exposed to the\r\nfuel.\r\n\r\nThe gases, which are the products of the combustion, escape from\r\nthe fuel at a very high temperature, and consequently, in\r\nacquiring that temperature they absorb a considerable [Pg255]\r\nquantity of the heat of combustion. But besides the gases actually\r\nformed in the process of combustion, the azote forming four fifths\r\nof the air carried through the fuel to support the combustion,\r\nabsorbs heat from the combustible, and rises into the upper part\r\nof the furnace at a high temperature. These various gases, if\r\nconducted directly to the chimney, would carry off with them a\r\nconsiderable quantity of the heat. Provision should therefore be\r\nmade to keep them in contact with the boiler such a length of time\r\nas will enable them to impart such a portion of the heat which\r\nthey have absorbed from the fuel, as will still leave them at a\r\ntemperature sufficient, and not more than sufficient, to produce\r\nthe necessary draft in the chimney.\r\n\r\n\r\n(147.) The forms of boiler which have been proposed as the most\r\nconvenient for the attainment of all these requisite purposes have\r\nbeen very various. If strength alone were considered, the\r\nspherical form would be the best; and the early boilers were very\r\nnearly hemispheres, placed on a slightly concave base. The form\r\nadopted by Watt, called the waggon boiler, consists of a\r\nsemi-cylindrical top, flat perpendicular sides, flat ends, and a\r\nslightly concave bottom. The steam intended to be used in boilers\r\nof this description did not exceed the pressure of the external\r\natmosphere by more than from 3 to 5 lbs. per square inch; and the\r\nflat sides and ends, though unfavourable to strength, could be\r\nconstructed sufficiently strong for this purpose. In a boiler of\r\nthis sort, the air and smoke passing through the flues that are\r\ncarried round it, are in contact at one side only with the boiler.\r\nThe brickwork, or other materials forming the flue, must therefore\r\nbe non-conductors of heat, that they may not absorb any\r\nconsiderable portion of heat from the air passing in contact with\r\nthem. A boiler of this form is represented in _fig._ 71.\r\n\r\nThe grate and a part of the flues are rendered visible by the\r\nremoval of a portion of the surrounding masonry in which the\r\nboiler is set. The interior of the boiler is also shown by cutting\r\noff one half of the semi-cylindrical roof. A longitudinal vertical\r\nsection is shown in _fig._ 72., and a cross section in _fig._ 73.\r\nA horizontal section taken above the level of the grate, and below\r\nthe level of the water in the boiler, showing [Pg256] the course\r\nof the flues, is given in _fig._ 74. The corresponding parts in\r\nall the figures are marked by the same letters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 71.]\r\n\r\nThe door by which fuel is introduced upon the grate is represented\r\nat A, and the door leading to the ash-pit at B. The fire bars at C\r\nslope downwards from the front at an angle of about 25°, giving a\r\ntendency to the fuel to move from the front towards the back of\r\nthe grate. The ash-pit D is constructed of such a magnitude, form,\r\nand depth, as to admit a current of atmospheric air to the\r\ngrate-bars, sufficient to sustain the combustion. The form of the\r\nash-pit is usually wide below, contracting towards the top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 72.]\r\n\r\nThe fuel when introduced at the fire-door A, should be laid on that\r\npart of the grate nearest to the fire-door, called the dead plates:\r\nthere it is submitted to the process of coking, by which the gases\r\nand volatile matter which it contains are expelled, and being\r\ncarried by a current of air, admitted [Pg257] through small\r\napertures in the fire-door over the burning fuel in the hinder part\r\nof the grate, they are burnt. When the fuel in front of the grate\r\nhas been thus _coked_, it is pushed back, and a fresh feed\r\nintroduced in front. The coal thus pushed back soon becomes vividly\r\nignited, and by continuing this process, the fuel spread over the\r\ngrate is maintained in the most active state of combustion at the\r\nhinder part of the grate. By such an arrangement, the smoke produced\r\nby the combustion of the fuel may be burnt before it enters the\r\nflues. The flame and heated air proceeding from the burning fuel\r\narising from the grate, and rushing towards the back of the furnace,\r\npasses over the _fire-bridge_ E, and is carried through the flue F\r\nwhich passes under the boiler. This flue (the cross section of which\r\nis shown in _fig._ 73., by the dark shade put under the boiler) is\r\nvery nearly equal in width to the bottom of the boiler, the space at\r\nthe bottom of the boiler, near the corners, being only what is\r\nsufficient to give the weight of the boiler support on the masonry\r\nforming the [Pg258] sides of the flue. The bottom of the boiler\r\nbeing concave, the flame and heated air as they pass along the flue\r\nrise to the upper part by the effects of their high temperature, and\r\n_lick_ the bottom of the boiler from the fire-bridge at E to the\r\nfurther end G.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 73.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 74.]\r\n\r\nAt G the flue rises to H, and turning to the side of the boiler at\r\nI I, conducts the flame in contact with the side from the back to\r\nthe front; it then passes through the flue K across the front, and\r\nreturns to the back by the other side [Pg259] flue L. The side\r\nflue is represented, stripped of the masonry, in _fig._ 71., and\r\nalso appears in the plan in _fig._ 74., and in the cross section\r\nin _fig._ 73. The course of the air is represented in _fig._ 74.\r\nby the arrows. From the flue L the air is conducted into the\r\nchimney at M.\r\n\r\nBy such an arrangement, the flame and heated air proceeding from\r\nthe grate are made to circulate round the boiler, and the length\r\nand magnitude of the flues through which it is conducted should be\r\nsuch, that when it shall arrive at the chimney its temperature\r\nshall be reduced, as nearly as is consistent with the maintenance\r\nof draught in the chimney, to the temperature of the water with\r\nwhich it is in contact.\r\n\r\nThe method of feeding the furnace, which has been described above,\r\nis one which, if conducted with skill and care, would produce a\r\nmuch more perfect combustion of the fuel than would attend the\r\ncommon method of filling the grate from the back to the front with\r\nfresh fuel, whenever the furnace is fed. This method, however, is\r\nrarely observed in the management of the furnace. It requires the\r\nconstant attention of the stokers (such is the name given to those\r\nwho feed the furnaces). The fuel must be supplied, not in large\r\nquantities, and at distant intervals, but in small quantities and\r\nmore frequently. On the other hand, the more common practice is to\r\nallow the fuel on the grate to be in a great degree burned away,\r\nand then to heap on a large quantity of fresh fuel, covering over\r\nwith it the burning fuel from the back to the front of the grate.\r\nWhen this is done, the heat of the ignited coal acting upon the\r\nfresh fuel introduced, expels the gases combined with it and,\r\nmixed with these, a quantity of carbon, in a state of minute\r\ndivision, forming an opaque black smoke. This is carried through\r\nthe flues and drawn up the chimney. The consequence is, that not\r\nonly a quantity of solid fuel is sent out of the chimney\r\nunconsumed, but the hydrogen and other gases also escape unburned,\r\nand a proportional waste of the combustible is produced; besides\r\nwhich, the nuisance of an atmosphere filled with smoke ensues.\r\nSuch effects are visible to all who observe the chimneys of\r\nsteam-vessels, while the engine is in operation. When the furnaces\r\nare thus filled with fresh fuel, a large volume of [Pg260] dense\r\nblack smoke is observed to issue from the chimney. This gradually\r\nsubsides as the fuel on the grate is ignited, and does not\r\nreappear until a fresh feed is introduced.\r\n\r\nThis method of feeding, by which the furnace would be made to\r\nconsume its own smoke, and the combustion of the fuel be rendered\r\ncomplete, is not however free from counteracting effects. In\r\nordinary furnaces the feed can only be introduced by opening the\r\nfire-doors, and during the time the fire-doors are opened a volume\r\nof cold air rushes in, which passing through the furnace is\r\ncarried through the flues to the chimney. Such is the effect of\r\nthis in lowering the temperature of the flues, that in many cases\r\nthe loss of heat occasioned is greater than any economy of fuel\r\nobtained by the complete consumption of smoke. Various methods,\r\nhowever, may be adopted by which fuel may be supplied to the grate\r\nwithout opening the fire-doors, and without disturbing the supply\r\nof air to the fire. A hopper built into the front of the furnace,\r\nwith a moveable bottom or valve, by which coals may be allowed to\r\ndrop in from time to time upon the front of the grate, would\r\naccomplish this.\r\n\r\n\r\n(148.) In order to secure the combustion of the gases evolved from\r\nthe coals placed in the front of the grate, it is necessary that a\r\nsupply of atmospheric air should be admitted with them over the\r\nburning fuel. This is effected by small apertures or regulators,\r\nprovided in the fire-doors, governed by sliding-plates, by which\r\nthey may be opened or closed to any required extent.\r\n\r\nA patent has recently been granted to Mr. Williams, one of the\r\ndirectors of the City of Dublin Steam Navigation Company, for a\r\nmethod of consuming the unburned gases which escape from the\r\ngrate, and are carried through the flues. This method consists in\r\nintroducing into the flue tubes placed in a vertical position, the\r\nlower ends of which being inserted in the bottom of the flue are\r\nmade to communicate with the ash-pit, and the upper ends of which\r\nare closed. The sides and tops of these tubes are pierced with\r\nsmall holes, through which atmospheric air drawn from the ash-pit\r\nissues in jets. The oxygen supplied by this air immediately\r\ncombines with the carburetted hydrogen, which [Pg261] having\r\nescaped from the furnace unburned is carried through the flues at\r\na sufficient temperature to enter into combination with the oxygen\r\nadmitted through holes in the tubes. A number of jets of flame\r\nthus proceed from these holes, having an appearance similar to the\r\nflame of a gas-lamp.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that such tubes must be inefficient unless they are\r\nplaced in the flues so near the furnace, that the temperature of\r\nthe unburned gases shall be sufficiently high to produce their\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\n\r\n(149.) The magnitude of the grate and ash-pit must be determined by\r\nthe rate at which the evaporation is required to be conducted in the\r\nboiler and the quality of the fuel. It must be a matter of regret,\r\nthat the proportions of the various parts of steam-engines, with\r\ntheir boilers and furnaces, have not been determined by any exact or\r\nsatisfactory experiments; and those who project and manufacture the\r\nengines themselves, are not less in ignorance on those points than\r\nothers. With coals of the common quality a certain average\r\nproportion must exist between the necessary magnitude of the\r\ngrate-surface and the quantity of water to be evaporated in a given\r\ntime in the boiler. But what that proportion is for any given\r\nquality of fuel, is at present unascertained. Each engine-maker\r\nfollows his own rule, and the rule thus followed is in most cases a\r\nmatter of bare conjecture, unsupported by any experimental evidence.\r\nSome engine-makers will allow a square foot of grate-surface for\r\nevery cubic foot of water per hour, which is expected to be\r\nevaporated in the boiler; others allow only half a square foot: and\r\npractice varies between these limits. Bituminous coals which melt\r\nand cake, and which burn with much flame and smoke, must be spread\r\nmore thinly on the grate than other descriptions of fuel, otherwise\r\na considerable quantity of combustible gases would be dismissed into\r\nthe flues unburnt. Such coals therefore, other circumstances being\r\nthe same, require a larger portion of grate-surface; and the same\r\nmay be said of coals which produce clinkers in their combustion, and\r\nform lumps of vitrified matter on the grate, by which the spaces\r\nbetween the grate-bars are speedily closed up. When such fuel is\r\nused, the grate-bars require to be frequently raked [Pg262] out,\r\notherwise the spaces between them being obstructed, the draught\r\nwould become insufficient for the due combustion of the fuel.\r\n\r\nTo facilitate the raking out of the grate, the bars are placed\r\nwith their ends towards the fire-door: they are usually made of\r\ncast-iron, from two to two inches and a half wide on the upper\r\nsurface, with intervals of nearly half an inch between them. The\r\nbars taper downwards, their under surfaces being much narrower\r\nthan their upper, the spaces between them thus widening, to\r\nfacilitate the fall of the ashes between them. The grate-bars\r\nslope downwards from the front to the back. The height of the\r\ncentre of the bottom of the boiler, above the front of the grate,\r\nis usually about two feet, and about three feet above the back of\r\nit. The concave bottom of the boiler, however, brings its surfaces\r\nat the slide closer to the grate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(150.) Between the evaporating power of the boiler, and the\r\nmagnitude of surface it exposes to the action of the furnace,\r\nthere is a relation which, like that of the grate surface, has\r\nnever been ascertained by any certain or satisfactory experimental\r\ninvestigation; much less have the different degrees of efficiency\r\nattending different parts of the boiler-surface been determined.\r\nThat part of the surface of the boiler immediately over and around\r\nthe grate, is exposed to the immediate radiation of the burning\r\nfuel, and is therefore probably the most efficient in the\r\nproduction of steam. The tendency of flame and heated air to rise,\r\nwould naturally bring them in the flues into closer contact with\r\nthose parts of the boiler-surface which are horizontal in their\r\nposition, and which form the tops of the flues, than with those\r\nwhich are lateral or vertical in their position, and which form\r\nthe sides of the flues. In a boiler constructed like that already\r\ndescribed, the flue-surface therefore, which would be most\r\nefficient, would be the concave bottom of the boiler extending\r\nfrom the fire-bridge to its remote end. In some boilers,\r\nespecially those in which steam of high pressure is produced, the\r\nform is cylindrical, the middle flue being formed into an\r\nelliptical tube the greater axis of which is horizontal from end\r\nto end of the boiler. It seems doubtful, however, [Pg263] whether\r\nin such a boiler the heat produces any useful effect on the water\r\nbelow the flue, the water above being always at a higher\r\ntemperature, and therefore lighter than that below, and\r\nconsequently no currents being established between the upper and\r\nlower strata of the water.\r\n\r\nIt was considered by Mr. Watt, but we are not aware on what\r\nexperimental grounds, that from eight to ten square feet of\r\nheating surface were sufficient to produce the evaporation of one\r\ncubic foot of water per hour. The practice of engine-makers since\r\nthat time has been to increase the allowance of heating surface\r\nfor the same rate of evaporation. Engine-builders have varied very\r\nmuch in this respect, some allowing twelve, fifteen, and even\r\neighteen square feet of surface for the same rate of evaporation.\r\nIt must, however, still be borne in mind, that whether this\r\nincreased allowance did or did not produce the actual evaporation\r\nimputed to it, has not been, as far as we are informed, ever\r\naccurately ascertained. The production of a given rate of\r\nevaporation by a moderate heat diffused over a larger surface,\r\nrather than by a fiercer temperature confined to a smaller\r\nsurface, is attended with many practical advantages. The plates of\r\nthe boiler acted upon by the fire are less exposed to oxydisation,\r\nand the boiler will be proportionally more durable.\r\n\r\n\r\n(151.) Besides presenting to the action of the fire a sufficient\r\nsurface to produce steam at the required rate, the capacity of the\r\nboiler must be proportioned to the quantity of water to be\r\nevaporated. The space within the boiler is appropriated to a\r\ntwofold purpose: 1st, To contain the water to be evaporated; 2dly,\r\nTo contain a quantity of ready made steam for the supply of the\r\ncylinder. If the space appropriated to the steam did not bear a\r\nconsiderable proportion to the magnitude of the cylinder, the\r\nmomentary expansion of the steam passing to the cylinder from the\r\nboiler at each stroke would reduce the pressure of the steam in a\r\ngreat proportion, and unless the pressure in the boiler were\r\nconsiderably greater than that which the steam is intended to have\r\nin the cylinder, the pressure in the latter would be reduced below\r\nthe proper amount. The proportion of the [Pg264] steam space in\r\nthe boiler to the magnitude of the cylinder has been very\r\nvariously estimated, nor can it be said that any practical rule of\r\na general kind has been adopted. It is held by some that the\r\nsteam-space will be sufficient if it contain five times the\r\nquantity of steam consumed at each stroke, while others maintain\r\nthat it should contain at least ten times that quantity, and\r\nopinions vary between these limits.\r\n\r\n\r\n(152.) The proportion of water-space in the boiler to its\r\nevaporating power should also be regulated, so that the\r\nintroduction of the feed at a comparatively low temperature may\r\nnot unduly chill the water in the boiler. Supposing the feed to be\r\nintroduced in a low pressure boiler at the temperature of 100°,\r\nand that the necessary temperature within the boiler be 225°, the\r\nquantity of water it contains should be about five times the\r\nquantity evaporated, and therefore also five times the quantity\r\nintroduced through the feed per hour. For every cubic foot of\r\nwater per hour therefore, intended to be evaporated by the boiler,\r\nwater-space for five cubic feet should be provided. It is,\r\nhowever, right to repeat that this (like almost every other so\r\ncalled rule) is the result not of any exact general calculation,\r\nbut one deduced from the custom which has obtained among the\r\nmanufacturers of steam-engines.\r\n\r\n\r\n(153.) The surface of the water in the boiler should always be\r\nabove the range of the flues. When the heated air in the flues\r\nacts upon a part of the boiler within which water is contained,\r\nthe water within receiving an increased temperature becomes, bulk\r\nfor bulk, lighter than the strata of water above it, and ascends.\r\nIt is replaced by the descending strata, which, in their turn\r\nreceiving increased temperature, rise to the surface; or if the\r\naction of the heat convert the water into steam, the bubbles of\r\nsteam rise to the surface, fresh portions of water continually\r\ncoming into contact with the boiler-plates on which the heated air\r\nor flame acts. By this process the boiler-plates are continually\r\ncooled, either by being successively washed by water at a lower\r\ntemperature, or by the heat taken from them becoming latent in the\r\nsteam bubbles formed in contact with them. But if the heat act\r\n[Pg265] upon a part of the boiler containing steam within it,\r\nwhich steam being a slow recipient of heat, and no currents being\r\nestablished, nor any phenomenon produced in which heat is rendered\r\nlatent, the heat of the fire communicated to the boiler-plates\r\naccumulates in them, and raises their temperature to an injurious\r\ndegree. The plates may by this means be softened, so as to cause\r\nthe boiler to burst, or the difference between the expansion of\r\nthe highly heated plates thus exposed to fire in contact with\r\nsteam and that of the plates which are cooled by contact with\r\nwater, may cause the joinings of the boiler-plates to open, and\r\nthe boiler to leak. By whatever means, therefore, the boiler be\r\nfed, care should be taken that the evaporation should not be\r\nallowed to reduce the level of the water in it below the highest\r\nflue.\r\n\r\n\r\n(154.) As the water by which the boiler is fed must always have a\r\nmuch lower temperature than that at which the boiler is\r\nmaintained, the supply of the feed will have a constant tendency\r\nto lower the temperature of the water, and this tendency will be\r\ndetermined by the proportion between the magnitude of the feed and\r\nthe quantity of water in the boiler.\r\n\r\nSince it is requisite that the level of the water in the boiler\r\nshall not suffer any considerable change, it is evident that the\r\nmagnitude of the feed must be equal to the quantity of water\r\nevaporated. If it were less, the level of the water would\r\ncontinually fall by reason of the excess of the evaporation over\r\nthe feed; and if it were greater, the level would rise by the\r\naccumulation of water in the boiler. If therefore the quantity of\r\nwater-space allowed in the boiler be five times the volume of\r\nwater evaporated per hour, the quantity introduced by the feed per\r\nhour, whether continuously or at intervals, must be of the same\r\namount. Since the process of evaporation is continuous, the\r\nvariation of level of water in the boiler will be entirely\r\ndependent on the intervals between the successive feeds. If the\r\nfeed be continuous, and always equal to the evaporation, then the\r\nlevel of the water in the boiler will undergo no change; but if\r\nwhile the evaporation is continuous the feed be made at intervals,\r\nthen the change of level of water in the boiler as [Pg266] well\r\nas its change of temperature, will be subject to a variation\r\nproportional to the intervals between the successive feeds. It is\r\nmanifest, therefore, that the feed should either be uninterrupted\r\nor be supplied at short intervals, so that the change of level and\r\ntemperature of the water in the boiler should not be considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n(155.) Different methods have been, from time to time, suggested\r\nfor indicating the level of the water in the boiler. We have\r\nalready mentioned the two gauge-pipes used in the earlier\r\nsteam-engines (31.), and which are still generally continued.\r\nThere are, however, some other methods which merit our attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 75.]\r\n\r\nA weight F (_fig._ 75.), half immersed in the water in the boiler,\r\nis supported by a wire, which, passing steam-tight through a small\r\nhole in the top, is connected by a flexible string, or chain,\r\npassing over a wheel W, with a counterpoise A, which is just\r\nsufficient to balance F when half immersed. If F be raised above the\r\nwater, _A_ being lighter will no longer balance it, and F will\r\ndescend pulling up A, and turning the wheel W. If, on the other\r\nhand, F be plunged deeper in the water, A will more than balance it,\r\nand will pull it up, so that the only position in which F and A will\r\nbalance each other is, when F is half immersed. The wheel W is so\r\nadjusted, that when two pins placed on its rim are in the horizontal\r\nposition, the water is at its proper level. Consequently it follows,\r\nthat if the water rise above this level, the weight F is lifted and\r\nA falls, so that the pins come into another position. If, on the\r\nother hand, the level of the water fall, F falls and A rises, so\r\nthat the pins assume a different position. Thus, in general, the\r\nposition of the pins becomes an indication of the quantity of water\r\nin the boiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n(156.) Another method is to place a glass tube (_fig._ 76.), with\r\none end T entering the boiler above the proper level, and the\r\nother end T′ entering it below the proper level. It must [Pg267]\r\nbe evident that the water in the tube will always stand at the\r\nsame level as the water in the boiler, since the lower part has a\r\nfree communication with that water, while the surface is submitted\r\nto the pressure of the same steam as the water in the boiler. This\r\nand the last-mentioned gauge have the advantage of addressing the\r\neye of the engineer at once, without any adjustment; whereas the\r\ngauge-cocks must be both opened, whenever the depth is to be\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 76.]\r\n\r\nThese gauges, however, require the frequent attention of the\r\nengine-man; and it becomes desirable either to find some more\r\neffectual means of awakening that attention, or to render the\r\nsupply of the boiler independent of any attention. In order to\r\nenforce the attention of the engine-man to replenish the boiler\r\nwhen partially exhausted by evaporation, a tube was sometimes\r\ninserted at the lowest level to which it was intended that the\r\nwater should be permitted to fall. This tube was conducted from\r\nthe boiler into the engine-house, where it terminated in a\r\nmouth-piece or whistle, so that whenever the water fell below the\r\nlevel at which this tube was inserted in the boiler, the steam\r\nwould rush through it, and issuing with great velocity at the\r\nmouth-piece, would summon the engineer to his duty with a call\r\nthat would rouse him even from sleep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 77.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(157.) In the most effectual of these methods, the task of\r\nreplenishing the boiler should still be executed by the engineer;\r\nand the utmost that the boiler itself was made to do, was to give\r\ndue notice of the necessity for the supply of water. The\r\nconsequence was, among other inconveniences, that the level of the\r\nwater was subject to constant variation.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this a method has been invented, by which [Pg268] the\r\nengine is made to feed its own boiler. The pipe G (_fig._ 77.),\r\nwhich leads from the hot water pump, terminates in a small cistern\r\nC in which the water is received. In the bottom of this cistern, a\r\nvalve V is placed, which opens upwards, and communicates with a\r\nfeed-pipe, which descends into the boiler below the level of the\r\nwater in it. The stem of the valve V is connected with a lever\r\nturning on the centre D, and loaded with a weight F dipped in the\r\nwater in the boiler in a manner similar to that described in\r\n_fig._ 75., and balanced by a counterpoise A in exactly the same\r\nway. When the level of the water in the boiler falls, the float F\r\nfalls with it, and pulling down the arm of the lever raises the\r\nvalve V, and lets the water descend into the boiler from the\r\ncistern C. When the boiler has thus been replenished, and the\r\nlevel raised to its former place, F will again be raised, and the\r\nvalve V closed by the weight A. In practice, however, the valve V\r\nadjusts itself by means of the effect of the water on the weight\r\nF, so as to permit the water from the feeding-cistern C to flow in\r\na continued stream, just sufficient in quantity to supply the\r\nconsumption from evaporation, and to maintain the level of the\r\nwater in the boiler constantly the same.\r\n\r\nBy this arrangement the boiler is made to replenish itself, or,\r\nmore properly speaking, it is made to receive such a supply, as\r\nthat it never wants replenishing, an effect which no effort of\r\nattention on the part of an engine-man could produce. But this is\r\nnot the only good effect produced by this contrivance. A part of\r\nthe steam which originally left the boiler, and having discharged\r\nits duty in moving the piston, was condensed and reconverted into\r\nwater, and lodged by the air-pump in the hot well (_fig._ 77.), is\r\nhere again restored to the source from which it came, bringing\r\nback all the unconsumed portion of its heat preparatory to being\r\nonce more put in circulation through the machine.\r\n\r\nThe entire quantity of hot water pumped into the cistern C, is not\r\nalways necessary for the boiler. A waste-pipe may be provided for\r\ncarrying off the surplus, which may be turned to any purpose for\r\nwhich it may be required; or it may be discharged into a cistern\r\nto cool, preparatory to [Pg269] being restored to the cold\r\ncistern, in case water for the supply of that cistern be not\r\nsufficiently abundant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 78.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(158.) Another method of arranging a self-regulating feeder is\r\nshown in _fig._ 78. A is a hollow ball of metal attached to the\r\nend of a lever, whose fulcrum is at B. The other arm of the lever\r\nC is connected with the stem of a spindle-valve, communicating\r\nwith a tube which receives water from the feeding-cistern. Thus,\r\nwhen the level of the water in the boiler subsides, the ball A\r\npreponderating over the weight of the opposite arm, the lever\r\nfalls, the arm C rises and opens the valve, and admits the feeding\r\nwater. This apparatus will evidently act in the same manner and on\r\nthe same principles as that already described. [Pg270]\r\n\r\nThe mouth of the tube by which the feed is introduced should be\r\nplaced at that part of the boiler which is nearest the end of the\r\nflues which issue into the chimney. By such means the temperature\r\nof the water in contact with those flues will be lowest at the\r\nplace where the temperature of the heated air intended to act upon\r\nit is also lowest. The difference of the temperatures will\r\ntherefore be greater than it would be if the point of the boiler\r\ncontaining water of a higher temperature was left in contact with\r\nthis part of the flue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 79.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(159.) It is necessary to have a ready method of ascertaining at\r\nall times the pressure of the steam which is used in working the\r\nengine. For this purpose a bent tube containing mercury is\r\ninserted into some part of the apparatus, which has free\r\ncommunication with the steam. Let A B C (_fig._ 79.) be such a\r\ntube. The pressure of the steam forces the mercury down in the leg\r\nA B, and up in the leg B C. If the mercury in both legs be at\r\nexactly the same level, the pressure of the steam must be exactly\r\nequal to that of the atmosphere; because the steam pressure on the\r\nmercury in A B balances the atmospheric pressure on the mercury in\r\nB C. If, however, the level of the mercury in B C be above the\r\nlevel of the mercury in B A, the pressure of the steam will exceed\r\nthat of the atmosphere. The excess of its pressure above that of\r\nthe atmosphere may be found by observing the difference of the\r\nlevel of the mercury in the tubes B C and B A, allowing a pressure\r\nof one pound on each square inch for every two inches in the\r\ndifference of the levels.\r\n\r\nIf, on the contrary, the level of the mercury in B C should fall\r\nbelow its level in A B, the atmospheric pressure will [Pg271]\r\nexceed that of the steam, and the quantity of the excess may be\r\nascertained exactly in the same way.\r\n\r\nIf the tube be glass, the difference of levels of the mercury\r\nwould be visible; but it is most commonly made of iron; and in\r\norder to ascertain the level, a thin wooden rod with a float is\r\ninserted in the open end of B C, so that the portion of the stick\r\nwithin the tube indicates the distance of the level of the mercury\r\nfrom its mouth. A bulb or cistern of mercury might be substituted\r\nfor the leg A B, as in the common barometer. This instrument is\r\ncalled the _steam-gauge_.\r\n\r\nIf the steam-gauge be used as a measure of the strength of the\r\nsteam which presses on the piston, it ought to be on the same side\r\nof the throttle-valve (which is regulated by the governor) as the\r\ncylinder; for if it were on the same side of the throttle-valve\r\nwith the boiler, it would not be affected by the changes which the\r\nsteam may undergo in passing through the throttle-valve, when\r\npartially closed by the agency of the governor.\r\n\r\nFor boilers in which steam of very high pressure is used, as in\r\nthose of locomotive engines, a steam-gauge, constructed on the above\r\nprinciple, would have inconvenient or impracticable length. In such\r\nboilers the pressure of the steam is equal to four or five times\r\nthat of the atmosphere, to indicate which the column of mercury in\r\nthe steam-gauge would be four or five feet in height. In such cases\r\na thermometer-gauge may be used with advantage. The principle of\r\nthis gauge is founded on the fact, that between the pressure and\r\ntemperature of steam produced in contact with water there is a fixed\r\nrelation, the same temperature always corresponding to the same\r\npressure. If, therefore, a thermometer be immersed in the boiler\r\nwhich shall show the temperature of the steam, a scale may be\r\nattached to it, on which shall be engraved the corresponding\r\npressures. Such gauges are now very generally used on locomotive\r\nengines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 80.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(160.) The force with which the piston is pressed depends on two\r\nthings, 1st, the actual strength of the steam which presses on it;\r\nand, 2dly, on the actual strength of the vapour which resists it.\r\nFor although the vacuum produced by the method of separate\r\ncondensation be much more perfect than [Pg272] what had been\r\nproduced in the atmospheric engines, yet still some vapour of a\r\nsmall degree of elasticity is found to be raised from the hot\r\nwater in the bottom of the condenser before it can be extracted by\r\nthe air-pump. One of these pressures is indicated by the\r\nsteam-gauge already described; but still, before we can estimate\r\nthe force with which the piston descends, it is necessary to\r\nascertain the force of the vapour which remains uncondensed, and\r\nresists the motion of the piston. Another gauge, called the\r\nbarometer-gauge, is provided for this purpose. A glass tube A B\r\n(_fig._ 80.), more than thirty inches long and open at both ends,\r\nis placed in an upright or vertical position, having the lower end\r\nB immersed in a cistern of mercury C. To the upper end is attached\r\na metal tube, which communicates with the condenser, in which a\r\nconstant vacuum, or rather high degree of rarefaction, is\r\nsustained. The same vacuum must therefore exist in the tube A B,\r\nabove the level of the mercury, and the atmospheric pressure on\r\nthe surface of the mercury in the cistern C will force the mercury\r\nup in the tube A B, until the column which is suspended in it is\r\nequal to the difference between the atmospheric pressure and the\r\npressure of the uncondensed steam. The difference between the\r\ncolumn of mercury sustained in this instrument and in the common\r\nbarometer, will determine the strength of the uncondensed steam,\r\nallowing a force proportional to one pound per square inch for\r\nevery two inches of mercury in the difference of the two columns.\r\nIn a well-constructed engine which is in good order, there is very\r\nlittle difference between the altitude in the barometer-gauge and\r\nthe common barometer.\r\n\r\nTo compute the force with which the piston descends, thus becomes a\r\nvery simple arithmetical process. First, ascertain the difference of\r\nthe levels of the mercury in the steam-gauge; this gives the excess\r\nof the steam pressure above the atmospheric pressure. Then find the\r\nheight of the mercury in the barometer-gauge; this gives the excess\r\nof the atmospheric pressure above the uncondensed steam. Hence, if\r\nthese two heights be added together, we shall obtain the [Pg273]\r\nexcess of the impelling force of the steam from the boiler, on the\r\none side of the piston, above the resistance of the uncondensed\r\nsteam on the other side: this will give the effective impelling\r\nforce. Now, if one pound be allowed for every two inches of mercury\r\nin the two columns just mentioned, we shall have the number of\r\npounds of impelling pressure on every square inch of the piston.\r\nThen, if the number of square inches in the section of the piston be\r\nfound, and multiplied by the number of pounds on each square inch,\r\nthe force with which it moves will be obtained.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have stated it appears that, in order to estimate the\r\nforce with which the piston is urged, it is necessary to refer to\r\nboth the barometer and the steam-gauge. This double computation\r\nmay be obviated by making one gauge serve both purposes. If the\r\nend C of the steam-gauge (_fig._ 79.), instead of communicating\r\nwith the atmosphere were continued to the condenser, we should\r\nhave the pressure of the steam acting upon the mercury in the tube\r\nB A, and the pressure of the uncondensed vapour which resists the\r\npiston acting on the mercury in the tube B C. Hence the difference\r\nof the levels of the mercury in the tubes would at once indicate\r\nthe difference between the force of the steam and that of the\r\nuncondensed vapour, which is the effective force with which the\r\npiston is urged.\r\n\r\n\r\n(161.) But these methods of determining the effective force by\r\nwhich the piston is urged, can only be regarded as approximations,\r\nand not very perfect ones. If the condensation of steam on one\r\nside of the piston were instantaneously effected, or the\r\nuncondensed vapour were of the same tension during the whole\r\nstroke; and if, besides this, the pressure of steam on the piston\r\nwere of uniform intensity from the beginning to the end of the\r\nstroke, then the steam and barometer gauges taken together would\r\nbecome an accurate index of the effective force of steam on the\r\npiston: but such is not the case. When the steam is first admitted\r\nthrough the steam-valve it acts on the piston with a pressure\r\nwhich is first slightly diminished, and afterwards a little\r\nincreased, until it arrives at that part of the stroke at which\r\nthe steam-valve is closed, after which the pressure is diminished.\r\nThe [Pg274] pressure, therefore, urging the piston is subject to\r\nvariation; but the pressure of the uncondensed vapour on the other\r\nside of the piston is subject to still greater change. At the\r\nmoment the exhausting-valve is opened, the piston is relieved from\r\nthe pressure upon it by the commencement of the condensation; but\r\nthis process during the descent of the piston is gradual, and the\r\nvacuum is rendered more and more perfect, until the piston has\r\nnearly attained the limit of its play. These variations, both as\r\nwell of the force urging the piston as of the force resisting it,\r\nare such as not to be capable of being accurately measured by a\r\nmercurial column, since they would produce oscillations in such a\r\ncolumn, which would render any observations of its mean height\r\nimpracticable.\r\n\r\nTo measure the mean efficient force of the piston, taking into\r\naccount these circumstances, Mr. Watt invented an instrument,\r\nwhich, like all his mechanical inventions, has answered its\r\npurpose perfectly, and is still in general use. This instrument,\r\ncalled an _indicator_, consists of a cylinder of about 1-3/4 inch\r\nin diameter, and 8 inches in length. It is bored with great\r\naccuracy, and fitted with a solid piston moving steam-tight in it\r\nwith very little friction. The rod of this piston is guided in the\r\ndirection of the axis of the cylinder through a collar in the top,\r\nso as not to be subject to friction in any part of its play. At\r\nthe bottom of the cylinder is a pipe governed by a stop-cock and\r\nturned in a screw, by which the instrument may be screwed on the\r\ntop of the steam-cylinder of the engine. In this position, if the\r\nstop-cock of the indicator be opened, a free communication will be\r\nmade between the cylinder of the indicator and that of the engine.\r\nThe piston-rod of the indicator is attached to a spiral spring,\r\nwhich is capable of extension and compression, and which by its\r\nelasticity is capable of measuring the force which extends or\r\ncompresses it in the same manner as a spring steel-yard or\r\nbalance. If a scale be attached to the instrument at any point on\r\nthe piston-rod to which an index might be attached, then the\r\nposition of that index upon the scale would be governed by the\r\nposition of the indicator-piston in its cylinder. If any force\r\npressed the indicator-piston upwards, so as to compress the\r\nspring, [Pg275] the index would rise upon the scale; and if, on\r\nthe other hand, a force pressed the indicator-piston downwards,\r\nthen the spiral spring would be extended, and the index on the\r\npiston-rod descend upon the scale. In each case the force of the\r\nspring, whether compressed or extended, would be equal to the\r\nforce urging the indicator-piston, and the scale might be so\r\ndivided as to show the amount of this force.\r\n\r\nNow, let the instrument be supposed to be screwed upon the top of\r\nthe cylinder of a steam-engine, and the stop-cock opened so as to\r\nleave a free communication between the cylinder of the indicator\r\nbelow its piston and the cylinder of the steam-engine above the\r\nsteam-piston. At the moment the upper steam-valve is opened, the\r\nsteam rushing in upon the steam-piston will also pass into the\r\nindicator, and press the indicator-piston upwards: the index upon\r\nits piston-rod will point upon the scale to the amount of pressure\r\nthus exerted. As the steam-piston descends, the indicator-piston\r\nwill vary its position with the varying pressure of the steam in\r\nthe cylinder, and the index on the piston-rod will play upon the\r\nscale, so as to show the pressure of the steam at each point\r\nduring the descent of the piston.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to observe and record the varying position of\r\nthe index on the piston-rod of the indicator, and to refer each of\r\nthese varying positions to the corresponding point of the descending\r\nstroke, we should then be able to declare the actual pressure of the\r\nsteam at every point of the stroke. But it is evident that such an\r\nobservation would not be practicable. A method, however, was\r\ncontrived by Mr. Southern, an assistant of Messrs. Boulton and Watt,\r\nby which this is perfectly effected. A square piece of paper, or\r\ncard, is stretched upon a board, which slides in grooves formed in a\r\nframe. This frame is placed in a vertical position near the\r\nindicator, so that the paper may be moved in a horizontal direction\r\nbackwards and forwards, through a space of fourteen or fifteen\r\ninches. Instead of an index a pencil is attached to the indicator of\r\nthe piston-rod: this pencil is lightly pressed by a spring against\r\nthe paper above mentioned, and as the paper is moved in a horizontal\r\ndirection [Pg276] under the pencil, would trace upon the paper a\r\nline. If the pencil were stationary this line would be straight and\r\nhorizontal, but if the pencil were subject to a vertical motion, the\r\nline traced on the paper moved under the pencil horizontally would\r\nbe a curve, the form of which would depend on the vertical motion of\r\nthe pencil. The board thus supporting the paper is put into\r\nconnexion by a light cord carried over pulleys with some part of the\r\nparallel motion, by which it is alternately moved to the right and\r\nto the left. As the piston ascends or descends, the whole play of\r\nthe board in the horizontal direction will therefore represent the\r\nlength of the stroke, and every fractional part of that play will\r\ncorrespond to a proportional part of the stroke of the steam-piston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 81.]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus being thus arranged, let us suppose the steam-piston\r\nat the top of the cylinder commencing its descent. As it descends,\r\nthe pencil attached to the indicator piston-rod varies its height\r\naccording to the varying pressure of the steam in the cylinder. At\r\nthe same time the paper is moved uniformly under the pencil, and a\r\ncurved line is traced upon it from right to left. When the piston\r\nhas reached the bottom of the cylinder, the upper exhausting-valve\r\nis opened, and the steam drawn off to the condenser. The\r\nindicator-piston being immediately relieved from a part of the\r\npressure acting upon it descends, and with it the pencil also\r\ndescends; but at the same time the steam-piston has begun to ascend,\r\nand the paper to return from left to right under the pencil. While\r\nthe steam-piston continues to ascend, the condensation becomes more\r\nand more perfect, and the vacuum in the cylinder, and therefore also\r\nin the indicator, being gradually increased in power, the\r\natmospheric pressure above the indicator-piston presses it downwards\r\nand stretches the spring. The pencil meanwhile, with the paper\r\nmoving under it from right to left, traces a second curve. As the\r\nformer curve showed the actual pressure of the steam impelling the\r\npiston in its descent, this latter will show the pressure of the\r\nuncondensed steam raising the piston in its ascent, and a comparison\r\nof the two will exhibit the effective force on the piston. _Fig._\r\n81. represents such a diagram as would be [Pg277] produced by this\r\ninstrument. A B C is the curve traced by the pencil during the\r\ndescent of the piston, and C D E that during its ascent. A is the\r\nposition of the pencil at the moment the piston commences its\r\ndescent, B is its position at the middle of the stroke, and C at the\r\ntermination of the stroke. On closing the upper steam-valve and\r\nclosing the exhausting-valve, the indicator-piston being gradually\r\nrelieved from the pressure of the steam the pencil descends, and at\r\nthe same time the paper moving from left to right, the pencil traces\r\nthe curve C D E, the gradual descent of this curve showing the\r\nprogressive increase of the vacuum. As the atmospheric pressure\r\nconstantly acts above the piston of the indicator, its position will\r\nbe determined by the difference between the atmospheric pressure and\r\nthe pressure of the steam below it; and therefore the difference\r\nbetween the heights of the pencil at corresponding points in the\r\nascending and descending stroke, will express the difference between\r\nthe pressure of the steam impelling the piston in the ascent and\r\nresisting it in the descent at these points. Thus at the middle of\r\nthe stroke, the line B D will express the extent to which the spring\r\ngoverning the indicator-piston would be stretched by the difference\r\nbetween the force of steam impelling the piston at the middle of the\r\ndescending stroke, and the force of steam resisting it at the middle\r\nof the ascending stroke. The force therefore measured by the line B\r\nD will be the effective force on the piston at that point; and the\r\nsame may be said of every part of the diagram produced by the\r\nindicator.\r\n\r\nThe whole mechanical effect produced by the stroke of the piston\r\nbeing composed of the aggregate of all its varying effects\r\nthroughout the stroke, the determination of its amount [Pg278] is\r\na matter of easy calculation by the measurement of the diagram\r\nsupplied by the indicator. Let the horizontal play of the pencil\r\nfrom A to C be divided into any proposed number of equal parts,\r\nsay ten: at the middle of the stroke, B D expresses the effective\r\nforce on the piston, and if this be considered to be uniform\r\nthrough the tenth part of the stroke, as from _f_ to _g_, then the\r\nnumber of pounds expressed by B D multiplied by the tenth part of\r\nthe stroke expressed in parts of a foot, will be the mechanical\r\neffect through that part of the stroke expressed in pounds' weight\r\nraised one foot. In like manner _m n_ will express the effective\r\nforce on the piston after three fourths of the stroke have been\r\nperformed, and if this be multiplied by a tenth part of the stroke\r\nas before, the mechanical effect similarly expressed will be\r\nobtained; and the same process being applied to any successive\r\ntenth part of the stroke, and the numerical results thus obtained\r\nbeing added together, the whole effect of the stroke will be\r\nobtained, expressed in pounds' weight raised one foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n(162.) By means of the indicator, the actual mechanical effect\r\nproduced by each stroke of the engine can be obtained, and if the\r\nactual number of strokes made in any given time be known, the\r\nwhole effect of the moving power would be determined. An\r\ninstrument called a _counter_ was also contrived by Watt, to be\r\nattached either to the working beam or to any other reciprocating\r\npart of the engine. This instrument consisted of a train of\r\nwheel-work with governing hands or indices moved upon divided\r\ndials, like the hand of a clock. A record of the strokes was\r\npreserved by means precisely similar to those by which the hands\r\nof a clock or time-piece indicated and recorded the number of\r\nvibrations of the pendulum or balance-wheel.\r\n\r\n\r\n(163.) To secure the boiler from accidents arising from the steam\r\ncontained in it acquiring an undue pressure, a safety-valve is\r\nused, similar in principle to those adopted in the early engines.\r\nThis valve is represented in _fig._ 71. at N. It is a conical\r\nvalve, kept down by a weight sliding on a rod upon it. When the\r\npressure of the steam overcomes the force of this weight, it\r\nraises the valve and escapes, being carried off through the tube.\r\n[Pg279]\r\n\r\nWith a view to the economy of heat, this waste steam tube is\r\nsometimes conducted into the feeding cistern, where the steam\r\ncarried off by it is condensed, and heats the feeding water.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the safety-valve should be such that, when open,\r\nsteam should be capable of passing through it as rapidly as it is\r\ngenerated in the boiler. The superficial magnitude, therefore, of\r\nsuch valves must be proportional to the evaporating power of the\r\nboiler. In low pressure boilers the steam is generally limited to\r\nfive or six pounds' pressure per square inch, and consequently the\r\nload over the safety-valve in pounds would be found by multiplying\r\nthe superficial magnitude of its smallest part by these numbers.\r\nIn boilers in which the steam is maintained at a higher pressure,\r\nit would be inconvenient to place upon the safety-valve the\r\nnecessary weight. In such cases a lever is used, the shorter arm\r\nof which presses down the valve, and the longer arm is held down\r\nby a weight capable of adjustment, so that the pressure on the\r\nvalve may be regulated at discretion. Two safety-valves should be\r\nprovided on all boilers, one of which should be locked up, so that\r\nthe persons in care of the engine should have no power to increase\r\nthe load upon it. In such case, however, it is necessary that a\r\nhandle connected with the valve should project outside the box\r\ncontaining it, so that it may always be possible for the engineer\r\nto ascertain that the valve is not locked in its seat, a\r\ncircumstance which is liable to happen.\r\n\r\nSometimes also two safety-valves are provided, one loaded a little\r\nheavier than the other. The escape of steam from the lighter valve\r\nin this case gives notice to the engine-man of the growing\r\nincrease of pressure, and warns him to check the production of\r\nsteam. The lever by which the safety-valve is held down is\r\nsometimes acted on by a spiral spring, capable of being so\r\nadjusted as to produce any required pressure on the valve. This\r\narrangement is adopted in locomotive engines, where steam of very\r\nhigh pressure is used; and in such cases also there are always\r\nprovided two such valves, one of which cannot be increased in its\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nThe pipe by which the boiler is fed with water will [Pg280]\r\nnecessarily act as a safety-valve, for when the pressure of the\r\nsteam increases in an undue degree, it will press the water in the\r\nboiler up through the feed-pipe, so as to discharge it into the\r\nfeed-cistern, a circumstance which would immediately give notice\r\nof the internal state of the boiler. The steam-gauge, already\r\ndescribed (_fig._ 79.), would also act as a safety-valve; for if\r\nthe pressure of steam in the boiler should be so augmented as to\r\nblow the mercury out of the steam-gauge, the steam would then\r\nissue through the gauge, and the pressure of the boiler be\r\nreduced, provided that the magnitude of the tube forming the\r\nsteam-gauge were sufficient for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n(164.) In high pressure boilers which are exposed to extreme\r\ntemperatures and pressures, and which are therefore subject to\r\ndanger of explosion, a plug of metal is sometimes inserted, which is\r\ncapable of being fused at a temperature above which the boiler\r\nshould not be permitted to be raised. If the pressure of steam\r\nincrease beyond the proper limit, the temperature of the water and\r\nsteam will undergo a corresponding increase; and if the metal of the\r\nplug be capable of being fused at such a temperature, the plug will\r\nfall out of the boiler, and the steam and water will issue from it.\r\nVarious alloys of metal are fusible at temperatures sufficiently low\r\nfor this purpose. An alloy composed of one part of lead, three of\r\ntin, and five of bismuth, will fuse at the common temperature of\r\nboiling water; and alloys of the same metals, in various\r\nproportions, will fuse at different temperatures from 200° to 400°.\r\n\r\nAlthough fusible plugs may be used, in addition to other means of\r\ninsuring safety, they ought not to be exclusively relied on at the\r\nordinary working pressure of the boiler. The fusible plug ought to\r\nbe capable of more than resisting the pressure; but if it be so,\r\nits point of fusion would be one at which the steam would have a\r\npressure of at least two atmospheres above its working pressure.\r\nThe plug would therefore be capable of being fused only as soon as\r\nthe steam would acquire a pressure of 30 lbs. per inch above its\r\nregular working pressure.\r\n\r\nWhen a boiler ceases to be worked, and the furnace has been\r\nextinguished, the space within it appropriated to steam [Pg281]\r\nwill be left a vacuum by the condensation of the steam with which\r\nit was previously filled. The external pressure of the atmosphere\r\nacting on the boiler would, under such circumstances, have a\r\ntendency to crush it inwards. To prevent this, a safety-valve is\r\nprovided, opening inwards, and balanced by a weight sufficient to\r\nkeep it closed until it be relieved from the pressure of the steam\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nA large aperture closed by a flange secured with screws,\r\nrepresented at O in _fig._ 71., called the _man-hole_, is provided\r\nto admit persons into the boiler for the purpose of cleaning or\r\nrepairing its interior.\r\n\r\n\r\n(165.) The manner in which the governor regulates the supply of\r\nsteam from the boiler to the cylinder, proportioning the quantity\r\nto the work to be done, and thereby sustaining a uniform motion,\r\nhas been already explained (p. 125.). Since then the _consumption_\r\nof steam in the engine is subject to variation, owing to the\r\nvarious quantities of work it may have to perform, it is evident\r\nthat the _production_ of steam in the boiler should be subject to\r\na proportional variation. For otherwise, one of two effects would\r\nensue: the boiler would either fail to supply the engine with\r\nsteam, or steam would accumulate in the boiler from being produced\r\nin too great abundance, and would escape at the safety-valve, and\r\nthus be wasted.\r\n\r\nIn order to vary the production of steam in proportion to the\r\ndemands of the engine, it is necessary to stimulate or mitigate\r\nthe furnace, as the evaporation is to be augmented or diminished.\r\n\r\nThe activity of the furnace must depend on the current of air\r\nwhich is drawn through the grate-bars, and this will depend on the\r\nmagnitude of the space afforded for the passage of that current\r\nthrough the flues. A plate called a _damper_ is accordingly placed\r\nwith its plane at right angles to the flue, so that by raising and\r\nlowering it in the same manner as the sash of a window is raised\r\nor lowered, the space allowed for the passage of air through the\r\nflue may be regulated. This plate might be regulated by the hand,\r\nso that by raising or lowering it the draught might be increased\r\nor diminished, and a corresponding effect produced on the [Pg282]\r\nevaporation in the boiler: but the force of the fire is rendered\r\nuniformly proportional to the rate of evaporation by the following\r\narrangement, without the intervention of the engineer. The column\r\nof water sustained in the feed-pipe (_figs._ 71, 72.) represents\r\nby its weight the difference between the pressure of steam within\r\nthe boiler and that of the atmosphere. If the engine consumes\r\nsteam faster than the boiler produces it, the steam contained in\r\nthe boiler acquires a diminished pressure, and consequently the\r\ncolumn of water in the feed-pipe will fall. If, on the other hand,\r\nthe boiler produce steam faster than the engine consumes it, the\r\naccumulation of steam in the boiler will cause an increased\r\npressure on the water it contains, and thereby increase the height\r\nof the column of water sustained in the feed-pipe. This column\r\ntherefore necessarily rises and falls with every variation in the\r\nrate of evaporation in the boiler. A hollow float P is placed upon\r\nthe surface of the water of this column; a chain connected with\r\nthis float is carried upwards, and passed over two pulleys, after\r\nwhich it is carried downwards through an aperture leading to the\r\nflue which passes beside the boiler: to this chain is attached the\r\ndamper. By such an arrangement it is evident that the damper will\r\nrise when the float P falls, and will fall when the float P rises,\r\nsince the weight of the damper is so adjusted, that it will only\r\nbalance the float P when the latter rests on the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nWhenever the evaporation of the boiler is insufficient, it is\r\nevident from what has been stated, that the float P will fall and\r\nthe damper will rise, and will afford a greater passage for air\r\nthrough the flue. This will stimulate the furnace, will augment\r\nits heating power, and will therefore increase the rate of\r\nevaporation in the boiler. If, on the other hand, the production\r\nof steam in the boiler be more than is requisite for the supply of\r\nthe engine, the float will be raised and the damper let down, so\r\nas to contract the flue, to diminish the draught, to mitigate the\r\nfire, and therefore to check the evaporation. In this way the\r\nexcess, or defect, of evaporation in the boiler is made to act\r\nupon the fire, so as to render the heat proceeding from the\r\ncombustion as nearly as possible proportional to the wants of the\r\nengine. [Pg283]\r\n\r\n\r\n(166.) The method of feeding the furnace by hand through the\r\nfire-door being subject to the double objection of admitting more\r\ncold air over the fuel than is necessary for its combustion, and\r\nthe impracticability of insuring that regular attendance on the\r\npart of the stokers, directed the attention of engineers to the\r\nconstruction of self-regulating furnaces. The most effectual of\r\nthese, and that which has come into most general use, was invented\r\nby Mr. William Brunton of Birmingham.\r\n\r\nThe advantages proposed to be attained by him were those expressed\r\nin his patent:—\r\n\r\n\"First, I put the coal upon the grate by small quantities, and at\r\nvery short intervals, say every two or three seconds. 2dly, I so\r\ndispose of the coals upon the grate, that the smoke evolved must\r\npass over that part of the grate upon which the coal is in full\r\ncombustion, and is thereby consumed. 3dly, As the introduction of\r\ncoal is uniform in short spaces of time, the introduction of air\r\nis also uniform, and requires no attention from the fireman.\r\n\r\n\"As it respects economy: 1st, The coal is put upon the fire by an\r\napparatus driven by the engine, and so contrived that the quantity\r\nof coal is proportioned to the quantity of work which the engine\r\nis performing; and the quantity of air admitted to consume the\r\nsmoke is regulated in the same manner. 2dly, The fire-door is\r\nnever opened, excepting to clean the fire; the boiler, of course,\r\nis not exposed to that continual irregularity of temperature which\r\nis unavoidable in the common furnace, and which is found\r\nexceedingly injurious to boilers. 3dly, The only attention\r\nrequired is to fill the coal-receiver every two or three hours,\r\nand clean the fire when necessary. 4thly, The coal is more\r\ncompletely consumed than by the common furnace, as all the effect\r\nof what is termed stirring up the fire (by which no inconsiderable\r\nquantity of coal is passed into the ash-pit), is attained without\r\nmoving the coal upon the grate.\"\r\n\r\nA circular grate is placed on a vertical revolving shaft; on the\r\nlower part of this shaft, under the ash-pit, is placed a toothed\r\nwheel driven by a pinion. This pinion is placed on another vertical\r\nshaft, which ascends above the boiler; and [Pg284] on the other end\r\nof this is placed a bevelled wheel driven by a pinion. This pinion\r\nis attached to a shaft, which takes its motion from the axis of the\r\nfly-wheel, or any other revolving shaft connected with the engine. A\r\nconstant motion of revolution is therefore imparted to the circular\r\ngrate, and its velocity being proportional to that of the engine,\r\nwill necessarily be also proportional to the quantity of fuel which\r\nought to be consumed. Through that part of the boiler which is over\r\nthe fire-grate a vertical tube or opening is made directly over that\r\npart of the furnace which is most distant from the flues. Over this\r\nopening a hopper is placed, which contains the fuel by which the\r\nboiler is to be fed; and in the bottom of this hopper is a sliding\r\nvalve, capable of being opened or closed, so as to regulate the\r\nquantity of fuel supplied to the fire-grate. The fuel dropping in in\r\nsmall quantities through this open valve falls on the grate, and is\r\ncarried round by it, so as to leave a fresh portion of the grate to\r\nreceive succeeding feeds. The coals admitted through the hopper are\r\npreviously broken to a proper size; and in some forms of this\r\napparatus there are two rollers, at a regulated distance asunder,\r\nthe surfaces of which are formed into blunt angular points, and\r\nwhich are kept in slow revolution by the engine. Between these\r\nrollers the coals must pass before they reach the valve through\r\nwhich the furnace is fed, and they are thus broken and reduced to a\r\nregulated size. The valve which regulates the opening through which\r\nthe feed is admitted, is connected by chains and pulleys with the\r\nself-regulating damper already described, so that in proportion as\r\nthe damper is raised, the valve governing the feed may be opened.\r\nThus, while the quantity of air admitted by the damper is increased\r\naccording to the demands of the engine, the quantity of fuel\r\nadmitted for the feed is increased by opening the valve in the\r\nbottom of the hopper in the same proportion. Apertures are also\r\nprovided in the front of the grate, governed by regulators, by which\r\nthe quantity of air necessary and sufficient to produce the\r\ncombustion of the gas evolved from the fuel is admitted, these\r\nopenings being also connected with the self-regulating damper.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the heat imparted to the water [Pg285]\r\nin the boiler escapes by radiation from the surface of the boiler,\r\nsteam-pipes, and other parts of the machinery in contact with the\r\nsteam and hot water. The effects of this are rendered very\r\napparent in marine engines, where a large quantity of water is\r\nfound to be condensed in the great steam-pipes leading from the\r\nboiler to the cylinder. In stationary land boilers this loss of\r\nheat is usually diminished, and in some cases in a great degree\r\nremoved, by surrounding the boiler with non-conducting substances.\r\nIn some cases the boiler is built round in brick work. In\r\nCornwall, where the economy is regarded perhaps to a greater\r\nextent than elsewhere, the boiler and steam-pipes are surrounded\r\nwith a packing of sawdust, which being almost a non-conductor of\r\nheat, is impervious to the heat proceeding from the surfaces with\r\nwhich it is in contact, and consequently confines all the heat\r\nwithin the boiler. In marine boilers it has been the practice\r\nrecently to clothe the boiler and steam-pipes with a coating of\r\nfelt, which is attended with a similar effect. When these remedies\r\nare properly applied, the loss of heat proceeding from the\r\nradiation of the boiler is reduced to an extremely small amount.\r\nThe engine-houses of some of the Cornish engines, where the boiler\r\ngenerates steam at a very high temperature, are nevertheless\r\nfrequently maintained at a lower temperature than the external\r\nair, and on entering them they have in a great degree the effect\r\nof a cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n(167.) All mechanical action is measured by the amount of force\r\nexercised, or resistance overcome, and the space through which\r\nthat force has acted, or through which the resistance has been\r\nmoved.\r\n\r\nThe gross amount of mechanical action developed by the moving\r\npower of an engine, is expended partly on moving the engine\r\nitself, and partly on overcoming the resistance on which the\r\nengine is intended to act. That part of the mechanical energy of\r\nthe moving power which is expended on the resistance or load which\r\nthe engine moves exclusively, and of the power expended on moving\r\nthe engine itself, is called _the useful effect_ of the machine.\r\n\r\nThe _gross effect_, therefore, exceeds the _useful effect_ by the\r\n[Pg286] amount of power spent in moving the engine, or which may\r\nbe wasted or destroyed in any way by the engine.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to express and estimate all mechanical effect whatever\r\nby nature of the resistance overcome, by an equivalent weight\r\nraised a certain height. Thus, if an engine exerts a certain power\r\nin driving a mill, in drawing a carriage on a road, or in\r\npropelling a vessel on water, the resistance against which it has\r\nto act must be equal to a definite amount of weight. If a carriage\r\nbe drawn, the traces are stretched by the tractive power, by the\r\nsame tension that would be given to them if a certain weight were\r\nappended to them. If the paddle-wheels of a boat are made to\r\nrevolve, the water opposes to them a resistance equal to that\r\nwhich would be produced, if instead of moving the water the wheel\r\nhad to raise some certain weight. In any case, therefore, weight\r\nbecomes the exponent of the energy of the resistance against which\r\nthe moving power acts.\r\n\r\nBut the amount of mechanical effect depends conjointly on the\r\namount of resistance, and the space through which that resistance\r\nis moved. The quantity of this effect, therefore, will be\r\nincreased in the same proportion, whether the quantity of\r\nresistance or the space through which that resistance is moved be\r\naugmented. Thus, a resistance of one hundred pounds, moved through\r\ntwo feet, is mechanically equivalent to a resistance of two\r\nhundred pounds moved through one foot, or of four hundred pounds\r\nmoved through six inches. To simplify, therefore, the expression\r\nof mechanical effect, it is usual to reduce it invariably to a\r\ncertain weight raised one foot. If the resistance under\r\nconsideration be equivalent to a certain weight raised through ten\r\nfeet, it is always expressed by ten times the amount of that\r\nweight raised through one foot.\r\n\r\nIt has also been usual in the expression of mechanical effect, to\r\ntake the pound weight as the unit of weight, and the foot as the\r\nunit of length, so that all mechanical effect whatsoever is\r\nexpressed by a certain number of pounds raised one foot.\r\n\r\n\r\n(168.) The gross effect of the moving power in a steam-engine, is\r\nthe whole mechanical force developed by the evaporation [Pg287]\r\nof water in the boiler. A part of this effect is lost by the\r\npartial condensation of the steam before it acts upon the piston,\r\nand by the imperfect condensation of it subsequently: another\r\nportion is expended on overcoming the friction of the different\r\nmoving parts, and in acting against the resistance which the air\r\nopposes to the machine. If the motion be subject to sudden shocks,\r\na portion of the power is then lost by the destruction of momentum\r\nwhich such shocks produce. But if those parts of the machine which\r\nhave a reciprocating motion be, as they ought to be, brought\r\ngradually to rest at each change of direction, then no power is\r\nabsorbed in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\n(169.) The useful effect of an engine is variously denominated\r\naccording to the relation under which it is considered. If it be\r\nreferred to the time during which it is produced, it is called\r\nPOWER.\r\n\r\n\r\n(170.) If it be referred to the fuel, by the combustion of which\r\nthe evaporation has been effected, it is called DUTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n(171.) When steam-engines were first brought into use, they were\r\ncommonly applied to work pumps for mills which had been previously\r\nworked or driven by horses. In forming their contracts, the first\r\nsteam-engine builders found themselves called upon to supply\r\nengines capable of executing the same work as was previously\r\nexecuted by some certain number of horses. It was therefore\r\nconvenient, and indeed necessary, to be able to express the\r\nperformance of these machines by comparison with the animal power\r\nto which manufacturers, miners, and others, had been so long\r\naccustomed. When an engine, therefore, was capable of performing\r\nthe same work in a given time as any given number of horses of\r\naverage strength usually performed, it was said to be an engine of\r\nso many horses' power. Steam-engines had been in use for a\r\nconsiderable time before this term had acquired any settled or\r\nuniform meaning, and the nominal power of engines was accordingly\r\nvery arbitrary. At length, however, the use of steam-engines\r\nbecame more extended, and the confusion and inconvenience arising\r\nout of all questions respecting the performance of engines,\r\nrendered it necessary that some fixed [Pg288] and definite\r\nmeaning should be assigned to the terms by which the powers of\r\nthis machine were expressed. To have abandoned the term\r\n_horse-power_, which had been so long in use, would have been\r\nobviously inconvenient; nor could there be any objection to its\r\ncontinuance, provided all engine-makers, and all those who used\r\nengines, could be brought to agree upon some standard by which the\r\nunit of horse-power might be defined. The performance of a horse\r\nof average strength working for eight hours a day was therefore\r\nselected as a standard, or unit, of steam-engine power. Smeaton\r\nestimated that such an animal, so working, was capable of\r\nperforming a quantity of work equal in its mechanical effect to\r\n22,916 lbs. raised one foot per minute, while Desaguliers\r\nestimated the same power at 27,500 lbs. raised through the same\r\nheight in the same time. The discrepancy between these estimates\r\nprobably arose from their being made from the performances of\r\ndifferent classes of horses. Messrs. Boulton and Watt caused\r\nexperiments to be made with the strong horses used in the\r\nbreweries in London, and from the result of these trials they\r\nassigned 33,000 lbs. raised one foot per minute, as the value of a\r\nhorse's power. This is the unit of engine-power now universally\r\nadopted; and when an engine is said to be of so many horses'\r\npower, what is meant is, that that engine, in good working order\r\nand properly managed, is capable of moving a resistance equal to\r\n33,000 lbs. through one foot per minute. Thus an engine of ten\r\nhorse-power is one that would raise 330,000 lbs. weight one foot\r\nper minute.\r\n\r\nWhether this estimate of an average horse's power be correct or\r\nnot, in reference to the actual work which the animal is capable\r\nof executing, is a matter of no present importance in its\r\napplication to steam-power. The steam-engine is no longer used to\r\nreplace the power of horses, and therefore no contracts are based\r\nupon such a comparison. The term horse-power, therefore, as\r\napplied to steam-engines, must be understood to have no reference\r\nwhatever to the actual animal power, but must be taken as a term\r\nhaving no other meaning than the expression of the ability of the\r\n[Pg289] machine to move the amount of resistance above mentioned\r\nthrough one foot per minute.\r\n\r\n\r\n(172.) It has been already explained (67.) that the conversion of\r\na given volume of water into steam is productive of a certain\r\ndefinite amount of mechanical force, this amount depending on the\r\npressure under which the water is evaporated, and the extent to\r\nwhich the expansive principle is used in working the steam. It is\r\nevident that this amount of mechanical effect is a major limit,\r\nwhich cannot be exceeded by the power of the engine.\r\n\r\nIf the steam be not worked expansively, then the whole power of\r\nthe water, transmitted in the form of steam from the boiler to the\r\nworking machinery, will be a matter of easy calculation, when the\r\npressure at which the steam is worked is known. A table,\r\nexhibiting the mechanical power of a cubic foot of water converted\r\ninto steam at various pressures, expressed in an equivalent number\r\nof pounds' weight raised one foot high, is given in the Appendix\r\nto this volume. Where much accuracy is sought for, the pressure at\r\nwhich the steam is used must be taken into account; but by\r\nreference to the table it will be seen, that when steam is worked\r\nwithout expansion, its mechanical effect varies very little with\r\nthe pressure. It may therefore be assumed, as has been already\r\nstated, that for every cubic inch of water transmitted in the form\r\nof steam to the cylinders, a force is produced, represented by a\r\nton weight raised a foot high. Now, as 33,000 lbs. is very nearly\r\n15 tons, it follows that 15 cubic inches of water converted into\r\nsteam per minute, or 900 cubic inches per hour, will produce a\r\nmechanical force equal to one horse. If, therefore, to 900 cubic\r\ninches be added the quantity of water per hour necessary to move\r\nthe engine itself, independently of its load, we shall obtain the\r\nquantity of water per hour which must be supplied by the boiler to\r\nthe engine for each horse-power, and this will be the same\r\nwhatever may be the magnitude or proportions of the cylinder.\r\n\r\n\r\n(173.) The quantity of power expended in working the engine\r\nitself, independently of that required to move its load, will be\r\nless in proportion to the degree of perfection which [Pg290] may\r\nbe attained in the construction of the engine, and to the order in\r\nwhich it is kept while working. Engines vary one from another so\r\nmuch in these respects, that it is scarcely possible to lay down\r\nany general rules for the quantity of power to be allowed over and\r\nabove what is necessary to move the load. The means whereby\r\nmechanical power is expended in working the engine may be\r\nenumerated as follows:—\r\n\r\n_First._ Steam in passing from the boiler to the cylinder is\r\nliable to lose its temperature by the radiation of the steam-pipes\r\nand other passages through which it is conducted. Since the steam\r\nproduced in the boiler is in contact with water, it will be common\r\nsteam (94.), and consequently the least loss of heat will cause a\r\npartial condensation. To whatever extent this condensation may be\r\ncarried, a proportional loss of power, in reference to the heat\r\nobtained from the fuel, will be entailed upon the engine.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the force necessary to move the steam from\r\nthe boiler to the cylinder through passages more or less\r\ncontracted, subject to the friction of the pipes and tubes through\r\nwhich it moves, should be taken into account in estimating the\r\npower, and a corresponding deduction made. This, however, is not\r\nthe case: the steam having passed into the cylinder remains common\r\nsteam, its pressure being diminished by reason of the force\r\nexpended in thus moving it from the boiler to the cylinder. But\r\nits mechanical efficacy at the reduced pressure is not sensibly\r\ndifferent from the efficacy which it had in the boiler. If at the\r\nreduced pressure its volume were the same, then a loss of effect\r\nwould be sustained equivalent to the difference of the pressures;\r\nbut its volume being augmented in very nearly the same proportion\r\nas its pressure is diminished, the mechanical efficacy of a given\r\nweight of steam in the cylinder will be sensibly the same as in\r\nthe boiler.\r\n\r\n_Second._ The radiation of heat from the cylinder and its\r\nappendages, will cause a partial condensation of steam, and\r\nthereby produce a diminished mechanical effect.\r\n\r\n_Third._ The steam, which at each stroke of the piston fills the\r\npassages between the steam-valves and the piston, at the [Pg291]\r\nmoment the latter commences the stroke will be inefficient. If it\r\nwere possible for the piston to come into steam-tight contact with\r\neach end of the cylinder, and that the steam-valve should be in\r\nimmediate contact with the side or top of the piston, then the\r\nwhole of the steam which would pass through the steam-valve would\r\nbe efficient; but as some space, however small, must remain\r\nbetween the piston and the ends of the cylinder, and between the\r\nside of the cylinder and the steam-valve, there will always be a\r\nvolume of steam bearing a sensible proportion to the magnitude of\r\nthe cylinder, which at each stroke of the piston will be\r\ninefficient. This volume of steam is called the _clearance_.\r\n\r\n_Fourth._ Since the piston must move in steam-tight contact with\r\nthe cylinder, it must have a definite amount of friction with the\r\nsides of the cylinder by whatever means it may be packed. This\r\nfriction will produce a corresponding resistance to the moving\r\npower.\r\n\r\n_Fifth._ The various joints of the machinery where steam is\r\ncontained are subject to leakage, and whatever amount of steam\r\nshall thus escape must be placed to the account of power lost.\r\n\r\n_Sixth._ When the eduction-valve is opened to admit the steam to\r\nthe condenser, a certain force is required to expel the steam from\r\nthe cylinder. This force reacts upon the piston, and counteracts\r\nto a proportional extent the moving power of the steam on the\r\nother side. Besides this the water in the condenser cannot be\r\nconveniently reduced below the temperature of about 100°, and at\r\nthis temperature steam has a pressure of about 1 lb. per square\r\ninch. This vapour will continue to fill the cylinder, and will\r\nresist the moving power which impels the piston.\r\n\r\n_Seventh._ Power must be provided for opening and closing the\r\nvalves or slides, for working the air-pump, hot-water pump, and\r\ncold-water pump, and finally to overcome the friction on the\r\njournals and centres of the parts of the parallel motion, the main\r\naxle of the beam, the connecting rod, crank, and fly-wheel axle.\r\n\r\nIt will be apparent how very much these sources of resistances\r\nmust vary in different engines, and how rough [Pg292] an\r\napproximation any general estimate must be of their gross amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n(174.) There are many circumstances which obstruct the practical\r\napplication of any standard of engine-power: the magnitude of\r\nfurnace, and the extent of heating surface necessary to produce\r\nany required rate of evaporation in the boiler, are unascertained;\r\neach engine-maker has his own rule in these matters, and all the\r\nrules are equally unsupported by any experimental test entitled to\r\nrespect. Thus the circumstances that govern the rate of\r\nevaporation in the boiler may be regarded as almost wholly\r\nunknown. But supposing the rate of evaporation to be ascertained,\r\nthe amount of power absorbed by the condensation of steam on its\r\npassage to the cylinder, the imperfect condensation of the same\r\nsteam after it has worked the piston, the friction of the various\r\nmoving parts of the machinery, and, above all, the difference of\r\neffect of these losses of power in engines constructed on\r\ndifferent scales of magnitude, are absolutely unknown. We are,\r\ntherefore, not placed in a condition to assign any thing more than\r\na general account of what has been the practice of engine-makers\r\nin constructing engines which are nominally of a certain power.\r\n\r\nIn common low-pressure engines of the larger kind, to which class\r\nalone we at present refer, it has been usual, with the same fuel\r\nand under like circumstances, to allow from 10 to 18 square feet\r\nof heating surface in the boiler for every nominal horse-power of\r\nthe engine. Within these wide limits the practice of engine-makers\r\nhas varied. It is not, however, to be supposed, that the boiler\r\nwith 18 square feet of surface per horse-power has the same\r\nevaporating power as that which has but 10. This difference,\r\ntherefore, amounts to nothing more than different manufacturers of\r\nsteam-engines putting into circulation boilers having powers\r\n_really_ different while they are _nominally_ the same. The\r\nmagnitude of the cylinder is regulated by the nominal power of the\r\nengine, and it is usual so to regulate the evaporating power of\r\nthe boiler, that the piston shall move at the average rate of 200\r\nfeet per minute. This being assumed, it is customary to allow\r\nabout 22 square inches of piston [Pg293] surface for every\r\nnominal horse-power of the engine. If this power were in\r\nconformity to the standard already defined, this amount of surface\r\nmoved at 200 feet per minute would be impelled by a pressure\r\namounting to 7-1/2 lbs. per square inch. The safety-valve of the\r\nboiler of such engines is usually loaded at from 4 to 5 lbs. per\r\nsquare inch, and consequently the steam in the boiler will have a\r\npressure of from 19 to 20 lbs. per square inch. If, therefore, the\r\neffective pressure on the piston be really only 7-1/2 lbs. per\r\nsquare inch, the pressure expended in overcoming the friction of\r\nthe engine, and the loss consequent on the partial condensation of\r\nsteam on one side and its imperfect condensation on the other,\r\nwould amount to from 12 to 13 lbs. per square inch, or nearly\r\ndouble the assumed useful effect of the engine.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Maudslay and Field are accustomed to allow an evaporation\r\nof ten gallons, or 1·6 cubic feet of water per hour, for each\r\nnominal horse-power of the engine. They also allow about 22 square\r\ninches of piston surface per nominal horse-power, the piston being\r\nsupposed to move at the rate of 200 feet per second.[24]\r\n\r\nThe quantity of grate surface necessary in proportion to the power\r\nof the engine, has been equally unascertained, and engine-makers\r\nvary in their practice from half a square foot to one square foot\r\nper nominal horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe proportion which the magnitude of the heating surface of the\r\nboiler, and the fire surface of the grate bears to the evaporating\r\npower of the boiler, has not been determined by experiment, nor,\r\nso far as we are informed, by any well-ascertained practical\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe estimates or rather conjectures of engine-makers, of the\r\nevaporation necessary to produce one horse-power, vary from one to\r\ntwo cubic feet of water per hour. It has been [Pg294] already\r\nshown that the evaporation of 900 cubic inches, or little more\r\nthan half a cubic foot per hour, evolves a gross mechanical effect\r\nrepresenting one horse-power; from which it appears, that if the\r\nevaporation of the boilers of steam engines were what engineers\r\nsuppose them to be, the gross mechanical power produced in them\r\nfor every nominal horse-power of the engine varies in actual\r\namount from the power of two to that of four horses.\r\n\r\nThe above estimates must be understood as referring to\r\ndouble-acting steam engines above thirty-horse power. The\r\ncircumstances attending the performance of single-acting engines\r\napplied to the drainage of mines, have been ascertained with much\r\ngreater precision. This has been mainly owing to a spirited system\r\nof general inspection, which has been established in Cornwall, to\r\nwhich we shall hereafter more particularly advert.\r\n\r\n\r\n(175.) In expressing the duty of engines, it would have been\r\ndesirable that the duty of the boiler should have been separated\r\nfrom that of the engine.\r\n\r\nThe duty of a boiler is estimated by the volume of water\r\nevaporated by a given quantity of fuel, independently of the time\r\nwhich such evaporation may take. The duty, therefore, will be\r\nexpressed by the number of cubic feet of water evaporated, divided\r\nby the number of bushels of coal necessary for that evaporation,\r\nsupposing the bushel of coal to be the unit of fuel. It will be\r\nobserved that the _duty_ of an engine or boiler is entirely\r\ndistinct from, and independent of, its _power_. One boiler may be\r\ngreater than another in power to any extent, while it may be equal\r\nto or less than it in duty. A bushel of coals may evaporate the\r\nsame number of cubic feet of water under two boilers, but may take\r\ntwice as great a time to produce such evaporation under one than\r\nunder the other. In such a case the power of one boiler will be\r\ndouble that of the other, while their duty will be the same.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, a bushel of coals consumed in working two engines\r\nmay produce the same useful effect, but it may produce that useful\r\neffect in the one in half the time it takes to produce it in the\r\nother. In that case the _duty_ of the engines will be the same,\r\nbut the _power_ of the one will be double that of the other.\r\n[Pg295]\r\n\r\nIn fine, _power_ has reference to _time_,—_duty_, to _fuel_. The\r\nmore rapidly the engine produces its mechanical effect, the\r\ngreater its power will be, whatever may be the fuel consumed in\r\nworking it. And, on the other hand, the greater the useful effect\r\nproduced by a given weight of fuel, the greater will be the duty,\r\nhowever long the time may be which the fuel may take to produce\r\nthe useful effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n(176.) The proportion of the stroke to the diameter of the\r\ncylinder must be determined by the velocity intended to be given\r\nto the piston. With the same capacity of cylinder, and the same\r\nevaporation in the boiler, the velocity of the piston will augment\r\nas the magnitude of its diameter is diminished.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of the diameter to the stroke of the cylinder is\r\nvery various. In engines used for steam-vessels the length of the\r\ncylinder very little exceeds its diameter. In land engines,\r\nhowever, the proportion of the length to the diameter is greater.\r\nIt is maintained by some that the proportion of the diameter and\r\nlength of the cylinder should be such as to render its surface\r\nexposed to the cooling of the external air, the smallest possible.\r\nTredgold has maintained that since, during the stroke, the steam\r\nis gradually exposed to contact with the surface of the cylinder\r\nfrom the top to the bottom, the mean surface exposed in contact\r\nwith steam being half that of the entire cylinder, the proportion\r\nof the diameter to the stroke should be such that the surface of\r\nhalf the length of the cylinder, added to the magnitude of the top\r\nand bottom, shall be a minimum. If this principle be admitted,\r\nthen the best proportion of the diameter to the stroke would be\r\nthat of one to two, the length of the stroke being twice the\r\ndiameter of the cylinder; but since the whole surface of the\r\ncylinder is constantly exposed to the cooling effects of the air,\r\nand since in the intervals of the stroke there is no sensible\r\nchange of the temperature of the surface, the loss of heat by\r\ncooling will in effect be the same, especially in double-acting\r\nengines, as if the cylinder were constantly filled with steam. If\r\nthis be admitted, then the object should be to give the cylinder\r\nsuch a proportion, that its entire surface, including the top and\r\nbottom, shall be a minimum. [Pg296] The proportion given by this\r\ncondition would be very nearly that which is observed in the\r\ncylinders of marine engines, viz. that the length of the cylinder\r\nshould be equal to its diameter.\r\n\r\nIf in a low-pressure engine the pressure of steam in the cylinder\r\nbe taken at 17 lbs. per square inch, then the volume of steam will\r\nbe about fifteen hundred times that of the water which produces\r\nit. For every cubic foot of water, therefore, in the effective\r\nevaporation of the boiler, 1500 cubic feet of steam will be passed\r\nthrough the cylinder. If it be intended that the motion of the\r\npiston shall be at the rate of 25 strokes per minute, or 1500\r\nstrokes per hour, then the capacity of that portion of the\r\ncylinder between the steam-valve and the piston at the end of the\r\nstroke, must consist of half as many cubic feet as there are cubic\r\nfeet per hour evaporated in the boiler. If the steam, therefore,\r\nbe cut off at half stroke, the number of cubic feet of space in\r\nthe cylinder will be equal to the number of cubic feet of water\r\neffectively evaporated by the boiler; and if a cubic foot of water\r\neffectively evaporated be taken as the measure of a horse-power,\r\nthen there would be as many cubic feet in the capacity of the\r\ncylinder as is equal to the nominal power of the engine.\r\n\r\n\r\n(177.) The duty of engines varies according to their form and\r\nmagnitude, the circumstances under which they are worked, and the\r\npurposes to which they are applied. In double-acting engines\r\nworking without expansion, the coal consumed per nominal\r\nhorse-power per hour varies from 7 to 12 lbs. An examination of\r\nthe steam-logs of several government steamers made by me a few\r\nyears since, gave, as the average of consumption of fuel at that\r\ntime of the best class of marine engines, about 8 lbs. per nominal\r\nhorse-power per hour. Since, however, no account could be obtained\r\nof the actual evaporation of water in the boiler, nor, with the\r\nnecessary degree of precision, of the quantity and pressure of the\r\nsteam which passed through the cylinders, this estimate must be\r\nregarded as an approximation subject to several causes of error.\r\nThe question of the duty of boilers and engines applied to the\r\n[Pg297] general purposes of manufactures and navigation, is one\r\nwhich has not yet been satisfactorily investigated; and it were\r\nmuch to be desired that the proprietors of such engines should\r\ncombine to establish a strict analysis of their performance in\r\nreference to their consumption of fuel, their evaporation of\r\nwater, and their useful effects. The results of such an\r\ninvestigation, if properly conducted, would perhaps tend more to\r\nthe improvement of the steam engine than any discoveries in\r\nscience, or inventions in mechanical detail likely to be made in\r\nthe present stage of the progress of that machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n(178.) A strict investigation of this kind has been for many years\r\ncarried on respecting the performance of the steam engines used\r\nfor the drainage of the mines in Cornwall; and it has been\r\nattended with effects the most beneficial to the interests of\r\nthose concerned in them. The engines to which this important\r\ninquiry has been applied being used for the purpose of pumping,\r\nare generally single-acting engines, in which steam is used\r\nexpansively to a great extent. The steam is produced under a very\r\nhigh pressure in the boiler, and being admitted to the cylinder is\r\ncut off after a small portion of the entire stroke has been made,\r\nthe remainder of the stroke being produced by the expansion of the\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1811, a number of the proprietors of the principal\r\nCornish mines agreed to establish this system of inspection, under\r\nthe management and direction of Captain Joel Lean, and to publish\r\nmonthly reports. In these reports were stated the following\r\nparticulars:—1. The load per square inch on the piston; 2. The\r\nconsumption of coal in bushels; 3. The number of strokes made by\r\nthe engine; 4. The length of the strokes in the pumps; 5. The load\r\nin pounds; 6. The duty of the engine, expressed by the number of\r\npounds raised one foot high by the consumption of a bushel of\r\ncoals; 7. The number of strokes per minute; 8. The diameter and\r\nstroke of the cylinder, and a general description of the engine.\r\nWhen these reports were commenced, the number of engines brought\r\nunder inspection was twenty-one. In the year 1813 it increased\r\nto twenty-nine; in 1814 to thirty-two; in 1820 the number\r\nreported upon increased [Pg298] to forty; in 1828 the number was\r\nfifty-seven; and in 1836 it was sixty-one. This gradual increase\r\nin the number of engines brought under this system of inspection,\r\nwas produced by the good effects which attended it. These\r\nbeneficial consequences were manifested, not only in the improved\r\nperformance of the same engines, but in the gradually improved\r\nefficiency of those which were afterwards constructed.\r\n\r\nThe following table taken from the statement of the duty of\r\nCornish engines by Thomas Lean and brother, lately published by\r\nthe British Association, will show in a striking manner the\r\nimprovement of the Cornish engines, from the commencement of this\r\nsystem of inspection to the present time. The duty is expressed by\r\nthe number of pounds raised one foot high by the consumption of a\r\nbushel of coals.\r\n\r\n  ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n        | No. of | Average Duty of the | Average Duty of the best\r\n  Years.|Engines.|      Whole.         |        Engine.\r\n  ——————+————————+————————————————————-+———————————————————————-—\r\n   1812 |   21   |      19,300,000     |\r\n   1813 |   29   |      19,500,000     |      26,400,000\r\n   1814 |   32   |      20,600,000     |      32,000,000\r\n   1815 |   35   |      20,500,000     |      28,700,000\r\n   1816 |   35   |      23,000,000     |      32,400,000\r\n   1817 |   35   |      26,500,000     |      41,600,000\r\n   1818 |   36   |      25,400,000     |      39,300,000\r\n   1819 |   40   |      26,300,000     |      40,000,000\r\n   1820 |   46   |      28,700,000     |      41,300,000\r\n   1821 |   45   |      28,200,000     |      42,800,000\r\n   1822 |   52   |      28,900,000     |      42,500,000\r\n   1823 |   52   |      28,200,000     |      42,100,000\r\n   1824 |   49   |      28,300,000     |      43,500,000\r\n   1825 |   56   |      32,000,000     |      45,400,000\r\n   1826 |   51   |      30,500,000     |      45,200,000\r\n   1827 |   51   |      32,100,000     |      59,700,000\r\n   1828 |   57   |      37,100,000     |      76,800,000\r\n   1829 |   53   |      41,700,000     |      77,000,000\r\n   1830 |   56   |      43,300,000     |      78,000,000\r\n   1831 |   58   |      43,400,000     |      71,100,000\r\n   1832 |   59   |      45,000,000     |      85,000,000\r\n   1833 |   56   |      46,600,000     |      84,300,000\r\n   1834 |   52   |      47,800,000     |      90,900,000\r\n   1835 |   51   |      47,800,000     |      91,700,000\r\n   1836 |   61   |      46,600,000     |      85,400,000\r\n   1837 |   58   |      47,000,000     |      87,200,000\r\n   1838 |   61   |      48,700,000     |      84,200,000\r\n  ——————+————————+————————————————————-+———————————————————————-—\r\n\r\n[Pg299] As an example of the beneficial effects produced upon the\r\nefficiency of an individual engine by the first application of\r\nthis system of inspection, the case of the Stray Park engine may\r\nbe mentioned. This engine, constructed by Boulton and Watt, had a\r\nsixty inch cylinder, and when first reported in 1811, its duty\r\namounted to 16,000,000 pounds. After having been reported on for\r\nthree years, its duty was found to have increased to 32,000,000;\r\nthis estimate being taken from the average result of twelve\r\nmonths' performance. Its duty was doubled in less than three\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIt will appear, by inspection of the duties registered in the\r\npreceding table, that the augmentation of the efficiency of the\r\nengines has not been the effect of any great or sudden improvement,\r\nbut has rather resulted from the combination of a great number of\r\nsmall improvements in the details of the operation of these\r\nmachines. In these improvements more is due to the successful\r\napplication of practical experience than to any new principles\r\ndeveloped by scientific research. Mr. John Taylor, in his \"Records\r\nof Mining,\" has traced the successive improvements on which the\r\nincreased duty of engines depends, and has connected these\r\nimprovements with their causes in the order of their dates. The\r\nfollowing results, abridged from his estimates, may not be\r\nuninteresting:—\r\n\r\nIn 1769, soon after the date of the earliest discoveries of Mr.\r\nWatt, but before they had come into practical application, Smeaton\r\ncomputed that the average duty of fifteen atmospheric engines,\r\nworking at Newcastle-on-Tyne, was 5,590,000. The duty of the best\r\nof these engines was 7,440,000, and that of the worst 3,220,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1772, Smeaton commenced his improvements on the atmospheric\r\nengine, and raised the duty to 9,450,000.\r\n\r\nIn 1776, Watt obtained a duty of 21,600,000.\r\n\r\nAt this time Smeaton acknowledged that Watt's engines gave a duty\r\namounting to double that of his own.\r\n\r\nIn 1778-79, Watt reported a duty of 23,400,000.\r\n\r\nFrom 1779 to 1788, Watt introduced the application of expansion,\r\nand raised the duty to 26,600,000. [Pg300]\r\n\r\nIn 1798, an engine by Boulton and Watt, erected at Herland, was\r\nreported as giving a duty of 27,000,000.\r\n\r\nThis engine, which was probably the best which at that time had\r\never been erected, attracted the particular attention of Mr. Watt,\r\nwho, on visiting Cornwall, went to see it, and had many\r\nexperiments tried with it. It was under the care of Mr. Murdock,\r\nthe agent of Messrs. Boulton and Watt in Cornwall. When Mr. Watt\r\ninspected it he pronounced it perfect, and that further\r\nimprovement could not be expected. How singular an instance this\r\nof the impossibility, even of the most sagacious, to foresee the\r\nresults of mechanical improvement! In twenty years afterwards the\r\naverage duty of the best engine was nearly 40,000,000, and in\r\nforty years it was above 84,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOILER MANUFACTORY.]\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [24] If 22 square inches of piston surface be allowed to\r\n  represent a horse-power, the power of an engine may always be\r\n  computed by dividing the square of the diameter of the piston\r\n  expressed in inches by 28. And, on the other hand, to find the\r\n  diameter of piston which would correspond to any given power,\r\n  multiply the number of horses' power by 28, and take the\r\n  square root of the product. These rules, however, cannot be\r\n  applied if the piston be supposed to move with any other\r\n  velocity; since, in that case, the same amount of piston\r\n  surface would cease to represent a horse-power, unless the\r\n  effective pressure on the piston were at the same time\r\n  changed.\r\n\r\n[Pg301]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATT'S CHAPEL IN HANDSWORTH CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nCHAP.

Having brought this historical analysis of the invention\r\nand application of the steam engine to the date of the decease of\r\nthe illustrious man, to the powers of whose mind the world stands\r\nindebted for the benefits conferred upon [Pg302] mankind by that\r\nmachine, it will perhaps not be deemed an improper digression in\r\nthis work, to devote some pages to a notice of the principal\r\nlabours of the same mind in other departments of art and science,\r\nand to circumstances connected with his personal history and the\r\nclose of his life, which cannot fail to possess general interest.\r\n\r\nAt the period when Watt, having connected himself in partnership\r\nwith Boulton, went to reside at Soho, near Birmingham, a number of\r\npersons, some of whom have since attained great celebrity by their\r\ndiscoveries and their works, and all of whom were devoted to\r\ninquiries connected with the arts and sciences, resided in that\r\nneighbourhood. Among these may be mentioned PRIESTLEY, whose\r\ndiscoveries in physical science have rendered his name immortal;\r\nDARWIN, the philosopher and poet; WITHERING, a distinguished\r\nphysician and botanist; KEIR, a chemist, who published a translation\r\nof Macquer, with annotations; GALTON, the ornithologist; and\r\nEDGEWORTH, whose investigations respecting wheeled carriages and\r\nother subjects, have rendered him well known. A society was formed\r\nby these and other individuals, of which Boulton and Watt were\r\nleading members, the meetings of which were held monthly on the\r\nevening of full moon, and which was thence called the _Lunar\r\nSociety_. At the meetings of this society, subjects connected with\r\nthe arts and sciences were discussed, and out of those discussions\r\noccasionally arose suggestions not unattended with important and\r\nadvantageous consequences. At one of these meetings, Darwin stated\r\nthat he had discovered a pen formed with two quills, by means of\r\nwhich, at a single operation, an original and a copy of a letter\r\nmight be produced. Watt almost instantly observed that he thought he\r\ncould find a better expedient, and that he would turn it in his mind\r\nthat night. By the next morning the COPYING PRESS was invented, for\r\nwhich he afterwards obtained a patent.\r\n\r\nThis machine, which is now so generally used in counting-houses,\r\nconsists of a rolling-press, by which a leaf of thin paper,\r\npreviously damped, is pressed upon the letter to be copied. The\r\nwriting, of which the ink is not yet quite dry, leaves its\r\nimpression upon the thin paper thus pressed upon [Pg303] it, and\r\nthe copy taken in this manner is read through the semi-transparent\r\npaper. If a letter be written with ink suitable for this purpose,\r\na copy may be taken at any time within several hours after the\r\nletter is written.\r\n\r\nThe method of heating apartments and buildings by steam, which has\r\nsince been improved and brought into extensive use, was likewise\r\nbrought forward by Watt. Although this contrivance had been\r\npreviously pointed out by Sir Hugh Platt about the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, and by Colonel Cooke in 1745, yet these\r\nsuggestions remained barren. Mr. Watt gave detailed methods of\r\nheating buildings by steam[25]; and also invented a machine for\r\ndrying linen by steam, a description of which he communicated to\r\nDr. Brewster, which was read in December, 1824, before the Society\r\nfor promoting Useful Arts in Scotland.[26]\r\n\r\nBut the circumstance, exclusive of those connected with the\r\ninvention of the steam engine, which is by far the most memorable\r\nin the career of Watt, is the share which he had in the discovery\r\nof the composition of water. As this circumstance has recently\r\nexcited much interest, and led to some controversy, we shall here\r\nstate, as distinctly as possible, the leading facts connected with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWater, which was so long held to be a simple element, has, in\r\nmodern times, been proved to be a substance consisting of two\r\naeriform bodies or gases chemically combined. These two gases are\r\nthose called in chemistry _oxygen_ and _hydrogen_. If eight grains\r\nweight of oxygen be mixed with one grain weight of hydrogen, and\r\nthe mixture be submitted to such effects as would cause the\r\nchemical combination of these two airs, it would be converted into\r\nnine grains weight of pure water.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, nine grains weight of pure water be\r\nsubmitted to any conditions which would separate its constituent\r\nparts, the result would be eight grains weight of oxygen gas, and\r\none grain weight of hydrogen gas. There are a variety of methods\r\nin physics by which these effects would be [Pg304] produced. It\r\nwill be sufficient here to state one method of producing each of\r\nthe above changes.\r\n\r\nIf eight grains weight of oxygen be inclosed in a strong vessel\r\nwith one grain weight of hydrogen, all other substances being\r\nexcluded, and the mixture be inflamed, an explosion will take\r\nplace, the gases will disappear, and a small quantity of water\r\nwill be the only substance remaining in the vessel. If this water\r\nbe weighed, it will be found to weigh exactly nine grains.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the metals have a strong attraction for oxygen\r\ngas, and this attraction is promoted by elevating their\r\ntemperature. If a glass tube be filled with iron wire heated to\r\nredness, and to one end of this tube a small vessel of boiling\r\nwater be attached, the steam evolved from the water will force its\r\nway through the spaces between the red-hot wires in the tube, and\r\nwould be expected to issue from the remote end; but if the\r\nsubstance issuing from the remote end of the tube be examined, it\r\nwill be found to be not steam, but hydrogen gas. If the quantity\r\nof this gas be ascertained by weight, and also the quantity of\r\nweight lost by the vessel of water at the other end of the tube,\r\nit will be found that the loss of weight of the water by\r\nevaporation will be nine times the weight of the hydrogen which\r\nhas issued from the remote end of the tube. If the weight of the\r\ntube with the wire contained in it be next ascertained, it will be\r\nfound to be increased by eight times the weight of the hydrogen\r\nwhich has issued from its remote end. From this it follows that\r\nthe weight of the hydrogen which has escaped from the tube, added\r\nto the increase of weight which has been given to the wire in the\r\ntube, makes up the whole weight of the water evaporated. If the\r\nwire in the tube be next examined, it will be found that it has\r\nsuffered oxydation, or, in other words, that a new substance has\r\nbeen formed in it called the oxyde of iron,—such substance being\r\na chemical compound formed of oxygen gas and iron.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that in this process the vapour of the\r\nwater, in passing through the tube, has been decomposed, and that,\r\nhaving given up to the iron its oxygen, the hydrogen [Pg305]\r\nalone escaped from the other end; and for every nine grains weight\r\nof steam which passed through the tube, eight grains of oxygen\r\nhave been combined with the iron, and one grain of hydrogen has\r\nescaped from the end of the tube.\r\n\r\nSuch are the class of effects on which the modern discovery of the\r\ncomposition of water has been based. The merit of that discovery\r\nhas been shared between the celebrated English chemist, CAVENDISH,\r\nand the not less celebrated French chemist, LAVOISIER, the chief\r\nmerit, however, being ascribed to the former.\r\n\r\nWe shall now briefly state the facts which led to this discovery,\r\nwith their dates, which will necessarily show the share which Watt\r\nhad in it.\r\n\r\nWhen pure hydrogen gas is burned in an atmosphere of common air,\r\nthe process which takes place is now known to be nothing more than\r\nthe chemical combination of the hydrogen with eight times its own\r\nweight of oxygen taken from the atmosphere, and the product of the\r\ncombustion is a quantity of water nine times the weight of the\r\nhydrogen consumed. In the year 1776, Macquer, a well-known chemist\r\nof that day, having held a saucer of white porcelain over a flame\r\nof hydrogen which was burning at the mouth of a bottle, observed\r\nthat no smoke was produced and no soot deposited on the saucer. On\r\nthe other hand, he found that after the lapse of some time drops\r\nof a clear pellucid liquid were perceptible on the saucer: this\r\nliquid he submitted to analysis, and found it to be pure water.\r\nMacquer mentioned this fact without comment or inference. It did\r\nnot occur to him that the water thus produced upon the saucer was\r\na substance which contained the hydrogen, which disappeared upon\r\ncombustion from the bottle.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of April, 1781, Mr. Warltire addressed a letter to Dr.\r\nPriestley, dated Birmingham, which letter is published in Dr.\r\nPriestley's _Experiments on Air_, printed at Birmingham in 1781,\r\nin which Warltire informs Priestley that he had fired a mixture of\r\nhydrogen and common air in close glass vessels, and that, although\r\npreviously to firing the mixture the vessels were clean and dry, a\r\ndewy deposit was [Pg306] observed afterwards on their sides. In\r\nfact, water was present which was not present before.\r\n\r\nThe mixture was in this case fired by passing an electric spark\r\nthrough the vessel; and it is now known that the effect produced\r\nwas the combination of the hydrogen, which formed part of the\r\nmixture of airs in the vessel with the oxygen, which also formed\r\npart of the same mixture.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from expressions in Warltire's letter, that the same\r\nexperiment had been previously made by Priestley, and the same\r\nresult observed by him.\r\n\r\nThe inference deduced from this by Warltire, and apparently\r\nacquiesced in by Priestley, was, that whenever hydrogen was fired\r\nin atmospheric air, the moisture, which is always more or less\r\nsustained in the latter, was deposited; but neither of these\r\nchemists perceived the real cause of the production of the water.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1783, and not later than the 21st of April,\r\nthis experiment of Warltire and Priestley was repeated by\r\nCavendish, with this difference, that, instead of exploding the\r\nmixture of hydrogen and common air, Cavendish exploded a mixture\r\nof hydrogen and oxygen. He observed that water was present after\r\nthe explosion, but _inferred nothing_.\r\n\r\nIn a published paper dated April, 1783, Priestley announced a\r\nfurther and most important result of his experiments. This was,\r\nthat in examining the weight of water produced by the explosion of\r\na mixture of oxygen and hydrogen, _that weight was found to be\r\nprecisely equal to the sum of the weights of the two gases_, which\r\ndisappeared in the process.\r\n\r\nImmediately on observing this, Priestley, being then, as has been\r\nalready stated, Watt's near neighbour, communicated to the latter\r\nwhat he had observed; upon which Watt immediately, viz. by a letter\r\ndated the 26th of the same month, declared that the inevitable\r\nconsequence which followed from Priestley's observations was, that\r\nwater was a substance compounded of oxygen and hydrogen deprived of\r\n[Pg307] a quantity of heat which was previously latent in them.[27]\r\nThe letter containing this inference was communicated immediately by\r\nPriestley to Sir Joseph Banks, then President of the Royal Society,\r\nto be laid before that body; and it is accordingly printed with its\r\nproper date in the 74th volume of the _Philosophical Transactions_.\r\n\r\nAbout two months after the date of Mr. Watt's letter just quoted,\r\nLavoisier made experiments on the combustion of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen, and read a memoir before the Academy of Sciences in\r\nParis, in which his views of the formation of water by the\r\ncombination of these gases were developed. This paper, by\r\nLavoisier, was afterwards printed in the Memoirs of the Academy in\r\nthe year 1784. The experiments are there stated to have been made\r\nin the month of June, 1783; and it is stated that Sir Charles\r\nBlagden, who was present at the experiments, told Lavoisier that\r\nMr. Cavendish had already burned the same gases in close vessels,\r\nand obtained a very sensible quantity of water.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of January, 1784, the celebrated paper by Cavendish,\r\nentitled \"Experiments on Air,\" was read before the Royal Society,\r\nand in this paper the composition of water by the union of oxygen\r\nand hydrogen is explained.\r\n\r\nIn a controversy which afterwards ensued on the respective\r\n[Pg308] claims of Cavendish and Lavoisier to credit for the\r\ndiscovery of the composition of water, Sir Charles Blagden stated\r\nthat he had told Lavoisier, in June, 1783, more than Lavoisier\r\nacknowledged, that he had not only told him that water was\r\nproduced by the combustion of the gases, but that his information\r\nembraced the whole theory of the composition of water. This\r\ndeclaration of Blagden was subsequent in date to January, 1784,\r\nand there is no evidence of any explanation of this theory, verbal\r\nor otherwise, having been given by Cavendish, or any other person,\r\nantecedent to April, 1783.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief statement of the facts and dates it will appear\r\nthat the merit of the discovery of the FACT, that the weight of\r\nwater resulting from the combustion of oxygen and hydrogen, is\r\nequal to the sum of the weights of the oxygen and hydrogen which\r\ndisappear in the combustion, is due to Priestley; and that the\r\nmerit of the INFERENCE from that fact, that water is a compound\r\nbody, whose constituents are oxygen and hydrogen, is due to\r\nWatt.[28] Whether those who subsequently deduced the same\r\ninference, and promulgated the same theory, were or were not\r\ninformed of Mr. Watt's solution of the phenomenon, or what credit\r\nmay be due to any person, however eminent, who at any time\r\nposterior to Mr. Watt's letter to Priestley, asserted that they\r\nhad, at a time antecedently to that, made the same inference\r\nwithout having published it, or communicated it in such a manner\r\nas to establish their claim upon rational and credible evidence,\r\nare questions which we shall not here discuss, being contented\r\nwith establishing the right of Mr. Watt to the merit of the\r\ndiscovery of the THEORY which explained the FACT discovered by\r\nPriestley.\r\n\r\nEven in his declining years, after he had withdrawn from the\r\nactive pursuits of his business, the least excitement was\r\nsufficient to call into play the slumbering powers of his\r\ninventive genius. No object could present itself to his notice\r\n[Pg309] without receiving from that genius adaptation in form and\r\nconstruction to useful purposes. As an example of this restless\r\nactivity of mind the following anecdote may be mentioned:—\r\n\r\nA company at Glasgow had erected on the right bank of the Clyde\r\nextensive buildings and powerful engines for supplying water to\r\nthe town. After this expense it was found that a source of water,\r\nof very superior quality, existed on the left bank of the river.\r\nTo change the site of the establishment, after the expense which\r\nhad been incurred in its erection could not be contemplated, and\r\nthey therefore proposed to carry across the bottom of the river a\r\nflexible suction pipe, the mouth of which should terminate in the\r\nsource from which the pure water was to be derived. This pipe was\r\nto be supported by a flooring constructed upon the bed of the\r\nriver; but it was soon apparent that the construction of such a\r\nflooring on a shifting and muddy bottom, full of inequalities, and\r\nunder several feet depth of water would require a greater\r\nexpenditure of capital than could with propriety be afforded. In\r\nthis difficulty the aged mechanician, for whom Glasgow itself had\r\nbeen the earliest stage of professional labour, was applied to,\r\nand instantly solved the problem. His attention is said to have\r\nbeen attracted by a lobster which had been served at table: he set\r\nhimself about to contrive how, by mechanism, he could make an\r\napparatus of iron with joints which should have all the\r\nflexibility of the tail of the lobster. He therefore proposed that\r\nan articulated suction-pipe, capable of accommodating itself to\r\nall the inequalities and to the possible changes of the bed of the\r\nriver, should be carried across it; that this flexible pipe should\r\nbe two feet in diameter, and one thousand feet in length. This\r\nproject the company accordingly caused to be executed after the\r\nplans and drawings of Watt with the most complete success.[29]\r\n\r\n[Pg310] Among the less prominent, though not less useful services\r\nrendered by Watt to his country, may be mentioned the introduction\r\nof the use of chlorine in bleaching. That invention of Berthollet\r\nwas introduced into England by Watt after his visit to Paris at\r\nthe close of the year 1786. He constructed all the necessary\r\napparatus for it, directed its erection, and superintended its\r\nfirst performances. He then left it to his wife's father, Mr.\r\nMacgregor, to carry on the processes.\r\n\r\nWhen the properties of the gases began to occupy the attention of\r\nchemists, attempts were made to apply them as a means of curing\r\ndiseases of the lungs. Dr. Beddoes pursued this inquiry with great\r\nactivity, and established, through the means of private\r\nsubscription, at Clifton, an institution in which this method of\r\ncure was carefully investigated. The Pneumatic Institution (for so\r\nit was called) has been rendered celebrated for having at its head\r\nHumphry Davy, just then commencing his scientific career. Among\r\nits founders was also numbered James Watt. Not content, however,\r\nwith affording the institution the sanction of his name, he\r\ndesigned and caused to be constructed, at Soho, the apparatus used\r\nfor making the gases and administering them to the patients.\r\n\r\nAs the exalted powers of the mind of Watt, unfolded in his\r\nnumerous mechanical and philosophical inventions and discoveries,\r\nhave commanded the admiration and respect of his species, the\r\naffection and love of his fellow men would not have been less\r\nconciliated, had the qualities of his heart, as developed in his\r\nprivate and personal relations, been as well known as the products\r\nof his genius.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1764, Watt being then in the twenty-ninth year of his\r\nage, married his cousin, Miss Miller. At this time he had fallen\r\ninto a state of despondency from his disappointments, which\r\nproduced a serious attack of nervous illness. The accomplishments\r\nand superior understanding, the mildness of temper and goodness of\r\ndisposition of his wife, soon restored him to health. Of this\r\nmarriage four children, two sons and two daughters, were the\r\nissue. Two of these children died in infancy; another, a daughter,\r\nwas married to Mr. Miller of Glasgow; and the fourth is the\r\n[Pg311] present Mr. James Watt. In September, 1773, while her\r\nhusband was engaged in the design of the Caledonian canal in the\r\nNorth of Scotland, Mrs. Watt died in child-bed of a fifth child,\r\nwho was still-born: \"Would that I might here transcribe,\" says M.\r\nArago, \"in all their simple beauty, some lines of the journal in\r\nwhich he daily recorded his inmost thoughts, his fears, his hopes!\r\nWould that you could see him, after this heavy affliction, pausing\r\non the threshold of that home, where 'HIS KIND WELCOMER' awaited\r\nhim no more; unable to summon courage to enter those rooms where\r\nhe was never more to meet 'THE COMFORT OF HIS LIFE!' Possibly, so\r\nfaithful a picture of a very deep sorrow might at last put to\r\nsilence those obstinate theorists, who, without being struck by\r\nthe thousands of instances to the contrary, do yet refuse\r\nqualities of the heart to every man whose intellect has been\r\nfostered by the fertile, sublime, and imperishable truths of the\r\nexact sciences!\"\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of some years Watt married Miss Macgregor, a\r\nperson who is represented to have possessed qualities of mind\r\nwhich rendered her a companion every way suitable to her husband.\r\nThis lady survived Watt, and died in 1832 at an advanced age. Two\r\nchildren were the issue of this second marriage.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1800 the extended patent right, which had been granted\r\nto Boulton and Watt for their improved engine, expired, and at\r\nthis time Mr. Watt retired altogether from business. He was\r\nsucceeded by his two sons, the present Mr. James Watt, and\r\nGregory, one of the children of his second marriage. The works at\r\nSoho continued to be conducted by the present Mr. Boulton, the son\r\nof the partner of Mr. Watt, and the two Messrs. Watt. In 1804\r\nGregory Watt died at the age of twenty-seven, of a disease of the\r\nchest. This afflicting event was deeply felt by Mr. Watt; but he\r\ndid not sink under it into that state of despondency in which he\r\nhas been represented to have fallen by M. Arago. On the contrary,\r\nhe continued to show the same activity of mind which had\r\ncharacterised his whole [Pg312] life; nor did he lose that\r\ninterest which he always took in the pursuit of literature and in\r\nsociety. The state of his feelings under this affliction is shown\r\nby the following extracts from letters written by him at that\r\ntime, which have been published by Mr. Muirhead.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Heathfield, January 26th, 1805.\r\n\r\n    * * \"I, perhaps, have said too much to you and Mrs. Campbell\r\n  on the state of my mind. I, therefore, think it necessary to\r\n  say that _I am not low spirited_; and were you here, you would\r\n  find me as cheerful in the company of my friends as usual; my\r\n  feelings for the loss of poor Gregory are not passion, but a\r\n  deep regret that such was his and my lot.\r\n\r\n    \"I know that all men must die, and I submit to the decrees\r\n  of nature, I hope with due reverence to the Disposer of\r\n  Events. Yet one stimulus to exertion is taken away, and,\r\n  somehow or other, I have lost my relish for my usual avocations.\r\n  Perhaps time may remedy that in some measure; meanwhile,\r\n  I do not neglect the means of amusement which are in my power.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Heathfield, April 8th, 1805.\r\n\r\n    * * \"It is rather mortifying to see how easily the want of\r\n  even the best of us is dispensed with in the world; but it is\r\n  very well it should be so. We here, however, cannot help\r\n  feeling a terrible blank in our family. When I look at my\r\n  son's books, his writings and drawings, I always say to\r\n  myself, where are the mind that conceived these things, and\r\n  the hands that executed them? In the course of nature, he\r\n  should have said so of mine; but it was otherwise ordered, and\r\n  our sorrow is unavailing. As Catullus says:—\r\n\r\n  —— 'Nunc it, per iter tenebricosum,\r\n  Illuc, unde negant redire quemquam.\r\n  At vobis male sit, malæ tenebræ\r\n  Orci, quæ omnia bella devoratis!'\r\n\r\n    \"But Catullus was a heathen; let us hope that he (G.) is now\r\n  rejoicing in another and a better world, free from our cares,\r\n  griefs, and infirmities. Some one has said, I shall not wholly\r\n  die; and Gregory's name, his merits and virtues, will live at\r\n  least as long as those do who knew him. You are not, from\r\n  this, to conceive that we give way to grief; on the contrary,\r\n  you will find us as cheerful as we ought to be, and as much\r\n  disposed to enjoy the friends we have left as ever; but we\r\n  should approach to brutes if we had no regrets.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Watt, at the date of these letters, had entered on his\r\nseventieth year, a period after which great mental exertions are\r\nrarely made. [Pg313]\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1819, symptoms of indisposition manifested\r\nthemselves which soon rendered Watt aware of his approaching\r\ndissolution. \"I am very sensible,\" said he to his afflicted\r\nfriends, \"of the attachment you show me, and I hasten to thank you\r\nfor it, as I am now come to my last illness.\" He died on the 25th\r\nof August, 1819. His remains were deposited in the church of\r\nHandsworth, near his estate of Heathfield. His son has raised over\r\nhis grave a Gothic chapel, in the centre of which is placed a\r\nstatue by Chantrey.\r\n\r\nThe personal character of Watt could not fail to excite the\r\nadmiration and the love of those distinguished persons, whose\r\npride and happiness it was to be admitted to a share in the\r\nfriendship of the great engineer. Among these were reckoned some\r\nof the men who will leave upon the present age the deepest and\r\nmost lasting impressions of their genius, and such persons have\r\nbequeathed to posterity the sentiments with which he inspired\r\nthem. We cannot here do more justice to the personal character of\r\nthe subject of this notice than by repeating the portraiture of it\r\nwhich has been given by three of the most distinguished of his\r\nfriends, and of the most illustrious men of the present age.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting convened in 1824, for erecting a monument to Watt,\r\nLord Brougham pronounced a speech, from which we extract the\r\nfollowing observations:—\r\n\r\n  \"I had the happiness of knowing Mr. Watt, for many years, in the\r\n  intercourse of private life; and I will take upon me to bear a\r\n  testimony in which all who had that gratification I am sure will\r\n  join, that they who only knew his public merit, prodigious as\r\n  that was, knew but half his worth. Those who were admitted to\r\n  his society will readily allow that anything more pure, more\r\n  candid, more simple, more scrupulously loving of justice, than\r\n  the whole habits of his life and conversation, proved him to be,\r\n  was never known in society. One of the most astonishing\r\n  circumstances in this truly great man, was the versatility of\r\n  his talents. His accomplishments were so various, the powers of\r\n  his mind were so vast, and yet of such universal application,\r\n  that it was hard to say whether we should most admire the\r\n  extraordinary grasp of his understanding, or the accuracy of\r\n  nice research with which he could bring it to bear upon the most\r\n  minute objects of investigation. I forget of whom it was said,\r\n  that his mind resembled the trunk of an elephant, which can pick\r\n  up [Pg314] straws, and tear up trees by the roots. Mr. Watt, in\r\n  some sort, resembled the greatest and most celebrated of his own\r\n  inventions, of which we are at a loss whether most to wonder at\r\n  the power of grappling with the mightiest objects, or of\r\n  handling the most minute; so that, while nothing seems too large\r\n  for its grasp, nothing seems too small for the delicacy of its\r\n  touch, which can cleave rocks, and pour forth rivers from the\r\n  bowels of the earth, and, with perfect exactness, though not\r\n  with greater ease, fashion the head of a pin, or strike the\r\n  impress of some curious die. Now, those who knew Mr. Watt, had\r\n  to contemplate a man whose genius could create such an engine,\r\n  and indulge in the most abstruse speculations of philosophy, and\r\n  could at once pass from the most sublime researches of geology\r\n  and physical astronomy, the formation of our globe, and the\r\n  structure of the universe, to the manufacture of a needle or a\r\n  nail; who could discuss, in the same conversation, and with\r\n  equal accuracy, if not with the same consummate skill, the most\r\n  forbidding details of art and the elegances of classical\r\n  literature, the most abstruse branches of science and the\r\n  niceties of verbal criticism.\r\n\r\n  \"There was one quality in Mr. Watt which most honourably\r\n  distinguished him from too many inventors, and was worthy of\r\n  all imitation—he was not only entirely free from jealousy,\r\n  but he exercised a careful and scrupulous self-denial, and was\r\n  anxious not to appear, even by accident, as appropriating to\r\n  himself that which he thought belonged to others. I have heard\r\n  him refuse the honour universally ascribed to him, of being\r\n  the inventor of the steam engine, and call himself simply its\r\n  improver; though, in my mind, to doubt his right to that\r\n  honour, would be as inaccurate as to question Sir Isaac\r\n  Newton's claim to his greatest discoveries, because Descartes\r\n  in mathematics, and Galileo in astronomy and mechanics, had\r\n  preceded him; or to deny the merits of his illustrious\r\n  successor, because galvanism was not his discovery, though,\r\n  before his time, it had remained as useless to science as the\r\n  instrument called a steam engine was to the arts before Mr.\r\n  Watt. The only jealousy I have known him to betray, was with\r\n  respect to others, in the nice adjustment he was fond of\r\n  giving to the claims of inventors. Justly prizing scientific\r\n  discovery above all other possessions, he deemed the title to\r\n  it so sacred, that you might hear him arguing by the hour to\r\n  settle disputed rights; and if you ever perceived his temper\r\n  ruffled, it was when one man's invention was claimed by, or\r\n  given to another; or when a clumsy adulation pressed upon\r\n  himself that which he knew to be not his own.\"\r\n\r\nIn the preface to the _Monastery_ Sir Walter Scott speaks of Watt\r\nin the following terms:—\r\n\r\n  \"There were assembled about half a score of our northern\r\n  lights. * * Amidst this company stood Mr. Watt, the man whose\r\n  genius discovered the means of multiplying our national\r\n  resources to a degree, perhaps, even beyond his own stupendous\r\n  powers of calculation and combination; bringing the treasures\r\n  of the abyss to the summit of the earth—giving the feeble arm\r\n  of man the momentum of an Afrite—commanding manufactures to\r\n  arise as the rod of the prophet produced water in the\r\n  desert—affording the means of dispensing with that time and\r\n  tide which wait for no man—and of sailing without that wind\r\n  which defied the command and threats of Xerxes himself. This\r\n  potent commander of the elements—this abridger of time and\r\n  space—this magician, whose cloudy [Pg315] machinery has\r\n  produced a change on the world, the effects of which,\r\n  extraordinary as they are, are, perhaps, only now beginning to\r\n  be felt—was not only the most profound man of science—the\r\n  most successful combiner of powers, and calculator of numbers,\r\n  as adapted to practical purposes—was not only one of the most\r\n  generally well informed, but one of the best and kindest of\r\n  human beings.\r\n\r\n  \"There he stood, surrounded by the little band I have\r\n  mentioned of northern literati, men not less tenacious,\r\n  generally speaking, of their own fame and their own opinions,\r\n  than the national regiments are supposed to be jealous of the\r\n  high character which they have won upon service. Methinks I\r\n  yet see and hear what I shall never see or hear again. In his\r\n  eighty-second year, the alert, kind, benevolent old man, had\r\n  his attention alive to every one's question, his information\r\n  at every one's command.\r\n\r\n  \"His talents and fancy overflowed on every subject. One gentleman\r\n  was a deep philologist—he talked with him on the origin of the\r\n  alphabet, as if he had been coeval with Cadmus; another a\r\n  celebrated critic—you would have said the old man had studied\r\n  political economy and belles lettres all his life. Of science it is\r\n  unnecessary to speak—it was his own distinguished walk. And yet,\r\n  Captain Clutterbuck, when he spoke with your countryman, Jedediah\r\n  Cleishbotham, you would have sworn he had been coeval with Claverse\r\n  and Burley, with the persecutors and persecuted, and could number\r\n  every shot the dragoons had fired at the fugitive Covenanters. In\r\n  fact, we discovered that no novel of the least celebrity escaped\r\n  his perusal, and that the gifted man of science was as much\r\n  addicted to the productions of your native country, in other words,\r\n  as shameless and obstinate a peruser of novels, as if he had been a\r\n  very milliner's apprentice of eighteen.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Edinburgh newspaper, called the _Scotsman_, of the 4th\r\nSeptember, 1819, immediately after the decease of Watt, the\r\nfollowing sketch was published from the pen of Lord Jeffrey:—\r\n\r\n  \"This name fortunately needs no commemoration of ours; for he\r\n  that bore it survived to see it crowned with undisputed and\r\n  unenvied honours; and many generations will probably pass away\r\n  before it shall have gathered 'all its fame.' We have said\r\n  that Mr. Watt was the great _improver_ of the steam engine;\r\n  but, in truth, as to all that is admirable in its structure,\r\n  or vast in its utility, he should rather be described as its\r\n  _inventor_. It was by his inventions, that its action was so\r\n  regulated as to make it capable of being applied to the finest\r\n  and most delicate manufactures, and its power so increased, as\r\n  to set weight and solidity at defiance. By his admirable\r\n  contrivance, it has become a thing stupendous alike for its\r\n  force and its flexibility—for the prodigious power which it\r\n  can exert, and the ease, and precision, and ductility with\r\n  which it can be varied, distributed, and applied. The trunk of\r\n  an elephant, that can pick up a pin or rend an oak, is as\r\n  nothing to it. It can engrave a seal, and crush masses of\r\n  obdurate metal before it—draw out, without breaking, a thread\r\n  as fine as gossamer, and lift a ship of war like a bauble in\r\n  the air. It can embroider muslin, and forge anchors—cut steel\r\n  into ribands, and impel loaded vessels against the fury of the\r\n  winds and waves. [Pg316]\r\n\r\n  \"It would be difficult to estimate the value of the benefits\r\n  which these inventions have conferred upon this country. There\r\n  is no branch of industry that has not been indebted to them;\r\n  and, in all the most material, they have not only widened most\r\n  magnificently the field of its exertions, but multiplied a\r\n  thousand fold the amount of its productions. It is our\r\n  improved steam engine that has fought the battles of Europe,\r\n  and exalted and sustained, through the late tremendous\r\n  contest, the political greatness of our land. It is the same\r\n  great power which now enables us to pay the interest of our\r\n  debt, and to maintain the arduous struggle in which we are\r\n  still engaged (1819), with the skill and capital of countries\r\n  less oppressed with taxation. But these are poor and narrow\r\n  views of its importance. It has increased indefinitely the\r\n  mass of human comforts and enjoyments, and rendered cheap and\r\n  accessible all over the world the materials of wealth and\r\n  prosperity. It has armed the feeble hand of man, in short,\r\n  with a power to which no limits can be assigned; completed the\r\n  dominion of mind over the most refractory qualities of matter;\r\n  and laid a sure foundation for all those future miracles of\r\n  mechanic power which are to aid and reward the labours of\r\n  after generations. It is to the genius of one man, too, that\r\n  all this is mainly owing; and certainly no man ever bestowed\r\n  such a gift on his kind. The blessing is not only universal,\r\n  but unbounded; and the fabled inventors of the plough and the\r\n  loom, who were deified by the erring gratitude of their rude\r\n  contemporaries, conferred less important benefits on mankind\r\n  than the inventor of our present steam engine.\r\n\r\n  \"This will be the fame of Watt with future generations; and it is\r\n  sufficient for his race and his country. But to those to whom he\r\n  more immediately belonged, who lived in his society and enjoyed his\r\n  conversation, it is not, perhaps, the character in which he will be\r\n  most frequently recalled—most deeply lamented—or even most highly\r\n  admired. Independently of his great attainments in mechanics, Mr.\r\n  Watt was an extraordinary, and in many respects a wonderful man.\r\n  Perhaps no individual in his age possessed so much and such varied\r\n  and exact information—had read so much, or remembered what he had\r\n  read so accurately and well. He had infinite quickness of\r\n  apprehension, a prodigious memory, and a certain rectifying and\r\n  methodising power of understanding, which extracted something\r\n  precious out of all that was presented to it. His stores of\r\n  miscellaneous knowledge were immense; and yet less astonishing than\r\n  the command he had at all times over them. It seemed as if every\r\n  subject that was casually started in conversation with him, had\r\n  been that which he had been last occupied in studying and\r\n  exhausting;—such was the copiousness, the precision, and the\r\n  admirable clearness of the information which he poured out upon it\r\n  without effort or hesitation. Nor was this promptitude and compass\r\n  of knowledge confined in any degree to the studies connected with\r\n  his ordinary pursuits. That he should have been minutely and\r\n  extensively skilled in chemistry and the arts, and in most of the\r\n  branches of physical science, might perhaps have been conjectured;\r\n  but it could not have been inferred from his usual occupations, and\r\n  probably is not generally known, that he was curiously learned in\r\n  many branches of antiquity, metaphysics, medicine, and etymology;\r\n  and perfectly at home in all the details of architecture, music,\r\n  and law. He was well acquainted, too, with most of the modern\r\n  languages, and familiar with their most recent literature. Nor was\r\n  it at all extraordinary to hear the great mechanician and engineer\r\n  detailing and expounding, for hours together, [Pg317] the\r\n  metaphysical theories of the German logicians, or criticising the\r\n  measures or the matter of the German poetry.\r\n\r\n  \"His astonishing memory was aided, no doubt, in a great measure,\r\n  by a still higher and rarer faculty—by his power of digesting,\r\n  and arranging in its proper place, all the information he\r\n  received; and of casting aside and rejecting, as it were\r\n  instinctively, whatever was worthless or immaterial. Every\r\n  conception that was suggested to his mind seemed instantly to\r\n  take its place among its other rich furniture, and to be\r\n  condensed into the smallest and most convenient form. He never\r\n  appeared, therefore, to be at all incumbered or perplexed with\r\n  the _verbiage_ of the dull books he perused, or to the idle talk\r\n  to which he listened; but to have at once extracted, by a kind\r\n  of intellectual alchemy, all that was worthy of attention, and\r\n  to have reduced it, for his own use, to its true value and to\r\n  its simplest form. And thus it often happened, that a great deal\r\n  more was learned from his brief and vigorous account of the\r\n  theories and arguments of tedious writers, than an ordinary\r\n  student could ever have derived from the most painful study of\r\n  the originals; and that errors and absurdities became manifest\r\n  from the mere clearness and plainness of his statement of them,\r\n  which might have deluded and perplexed most of his hearers\r\n  without that invaluable assistance.\r\n\r\n  \"It is needless to say that, with those vast resources, his\r\n  conversation was at all times rich and instructive in no ordinary\r\n  degree: but it was, if possible, still more pleasing than wise; and\r\n  had all the charms of familiarity with all the substantial\r\n  treasures of knowledge. No man could be more social in his spirit,\r\n  less assuming or fastidious in his manners, or more kind and\r\n  indulgent toward all who approached him. He rather liked to\r\n  talk,—at least in his latter years; but though he took a\r\n  considerable share of the conversation, he rarely suggested the\r\n  topics on which it was to turn, but readily and quietly took up\r\n  whatever was presented by those around him, and astonished the idle\r\n  and barren propounders of an ordinary theme by the treasures which\r\n  he drew from the mine they had unconsciously opened. He generally\r\n  seemed, indeed, to have no choice or predilection for one subject\r\n  of discourse rather than another; but allowed his mind, like a\r\n  great cyclopædia, to be opened at any letter his associates might\r\n  choose to turn up, and only endeavoured to select from his\r\n  inexhaustible stores, what might be best adapted to the taste of\r\n  his present hearers. As to their capacity he gave himself no\r\n  trouble; and indeed such was his singular talent for making all\r\n  things plain, clear, and intelligible, that scarcely any one could\r\n  be aware of such a deficiency in his presence. His talk, too,\r\n  though overflowing with information, had no resemblance to\r\n  lecturing or solemn discoursing, but, on the contrary, was full of\r\n  colloquial spirit and pleasantry. He had a certain quiet and grave\r\n  humour which ran through most of his conversation; and a vein of\r\n  temperate jocularity, which gave infinite zest and effect to the\r\n  condensed and inexhaustible information which formed its main\r\n  staple and characteristic. There was a little air of affected\r\n  testiness, and a tone of pretended rebuke and contradiction, with\r\n  which he used to address his younger friends, that was always felt\r\n  by them as an endearing mark of his kindness and familiarity; and\r\n  prized, accordingly, far beyond all the solemn compliments that\r\n  ever proceeded from the lips of authority. His voice was deep and\r\n  powerful, though he commonly spoke in a low and somewhat monotonous\r\n  tone, which harmonised admirably with the weight and brevity of his\r\n  observations, and set off to the greatest advantage the pleasant\r\n  [Pg318] anecdotes, which he delivered with the same grave brow, and\r\n  the same calm smile playing soberly on his lips. There was nothing\r\n  of effort, indeed, or impatience, any more than of pride or levity,\r\n  in his demeanour; and there was a finer expression of reposing\r\n  strength, and mild self-possession in his manner, than we ever\r\n  recollect to have met with in any other person. He had in his\r\n  character the utmost abhorrence for all sorts of forwardness,\r\n  parade, and pretensions; and, indeed, never failed to put all such\r\n  impostures out of countenance, by the manly plainness and honest\r\n  intrepidity of his language and deportment.\r\n\r\n  \"In his temper and dispositions, he was not only kind and\r\n  affectionate, but generous, and considerate of the feelings of\r\n  all around him; and gave the most liberal assistance and\r\n  encouragement to all young persons who showed any indications of\r\n  talent, or applied to him for patronage or advice. His health,\r\n  which was delicate from his youth upwards, seemed to become\r\n  firmer as he advanced in years; and he preserved, up almost to\r\n  the last moment of his existence, not only the full command of\r\n  his extraordinary intellect, but all the alacrity of spirit and\r\n  the social gaiety which had illumined his happiest days. His\r\n  friends in this part of the country never saw him more full of\r\n  intellectual vigour and colloquial animation—never more\r\n  delightful or more instructive—than in his last visit to\r\n  Scotland in autumn 1817. Indeed, it was after that time that he\r\n  applied himself, with all the ardour of early life, to the\r\n  invention of a machine for mechanically copying all sorts of\r\n  sculpture and statuary; and distributed among his friends some\r\n  of its earliest performances, as the productions of a young\r\n  artist just entering on his eighty-third year.\r\n\r\n  \"This happy and useful life came, at last, to a gentle close.\r\n  He had suffered some inconvenience through the summer; but was\r\n  not seriously indisposed till within a few weeks of his death.\r\n  He then became perfectly aware of the event which was\r\n  approaching; and with his usual tranquillity and benevolence\r\n  of nature, seemed only anxious to point out to the friends\r\n  around him, the many sources of consolation which were\r\n  afforded by the circumstances under which it was about to take\r\n  place. He expressed his sincere gratitude to Providence for\r\n  the length of days with which he had been blessed, and his\r\n  exemption from most of the infirmities of age; as well as for\r\n  the calm and cheerful evening of life that he had been\r\n  permitted to enjoy, after the honourable labours of the day\r\n  had been concluded. And thus, full of years and honours, in\r\n  all calmness and tranquillity, he yielded up his soul without\r\n  pang or struggle; and passed from the bosom of his family to\r\n  that of his God.\"\r\n\r\nThe English nation has ever shown itself insensible to the claims\r\nof genius and high intellectual endowments, except where the\r\nresults have been brought directly to bear in statesmanship or\r\nwar. Of this inability to appreciate the highest order of\r\nintellectual excellence Watt affords a striking example. When it\r\nwas suggested to the British government by those better capable\r\nthan that government was of appreciating the genius of this great\r\nman, that the nation would do itself honour by erecting a splendid\r\nmonument at his own [Pg319] cost to him to whom it was so deeply\r\nindebted for the extension of its resources and the augmentation\r\nof its power, the reply was that such a measure could not be\r\nadopted as it might be drawn into a precedent in like cases\r\nthereafter! A precedent in like cases!! When will the time arrive\r\nwhen the world will produce a like case? The monument which has\r\nbeen erected in Westminster Abbey was in fact raised by private\r\nsubscription, the nation having thus stigmatised itself through\r\nthe act of its government with the everlasting disgrace of\r\nrefusing the honour proposed to it. The other statues and\r\nmonuments which have been erected to this great man, have been for\r\nthe most part raised by the filial piety and the never-dying\r\naffection and veneration of the present Mr. James Watt. A statue\r\nhas been presented by him to the University of Glasgow, and placed\r\nin one of the halls of that college. The inhabitants of Greenock\r\nhave also erected a marble statue of Watt, for which, and for a\r\nlibrary, a building has been erected at the expense of about\r\n3,500_l._ which has been defrayed by Mr. James Watt. A colossal\r\nbronze statue has been erected on a handsome granite pedestal,\r\nstanding at one of the corners of George Square, Glasgow. The\r\nmonument in Westminster Abbey, erected by the subscription raised\r\nat the public meeting already alluded to, is a colossal statue of\r\nCarrara marble, by Chantrey.\r\n\r\nWatt was elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in\r\n1784; of the Royal Society of London in 1785; a member of the\r\nBatavian Society in 1787; and a corresponding member of the\r\nInstitut of France in 1808. The degree of Doctor of Laws was\r\nconferred upon him by the University of Glasgow, in 1806; and in\r\n1814, the highest scientific honour which can be attained by a\r\nphilosopher, was conferred on him by the Academy of Sciences of\r\nthe Institut of France, who nominated him one of its eight foreign\r\nassociates.\r\n\r\nOn the pedestal of the monument in Westminster Abbey is engraved\r\nthe following inscription from the pen of Lord Brougham:—\r\n[Pg320]\r\n\r\n  NOT TO PERPETUATE A NAME WHICH MUST ENDURE WHILE THE PEACEFUL\r\n  ARTS FLOURISH, BUT TO SHOW THAT MANKIND HAVE LEARNED TO HONOUR\r\n  THOSE WHO BEST DESERVE THEIR GRATITUDE, THE KING HIS MINISTERS,\r\n  AND MANY OF THE NOBLES AND COMMONERS OF THE REALM RAISED THIS\r\n  MONUMENT TO\r\n\r\n  JAMES WATT,\r\n\r\n  WHO DIRECTING THE FORCE OF AN ORIGINAL GENIUS, EARLY EXERCISED\r\n  IN PHILOSOPHIC RESEARCH TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE STEAM\r\n  ENGINE, ENLARGED THE RESOURCES OF HIS COUNTRY, INCREASED THE\r\n  POWER OF MAN, AND ROSE TO AN EMINENT PLACE AMONG THE MOST\r\n  ILLUSTRIOUS FOLLOWERS OF SCIENCE AND THE REAL BENEFACTORS OF\r\n  THE WORLD.

When the vessel is cooled,\r\n  a quantity of water is found in it equal to the weight of the\r\n  air employed. This water is then the only remaining product of\r\n  the process; and water, light, and heat are all the products.\r\n\r\n  \"Are we not then authorised to conclude, that water is composed\r\n  of dephlogisticated air (oxygen) and phlogiston (hydrogen),\r\n  deprived of part of their latent or elementary heat; that\r\n  dephlogisticated or pure air (oxygen) is composed of water\r\n  deprived of its phlogiston (hydrogen), and united to elementary\r\n  heat and light; and that the latter are contained in it in a\r\n  latent state, so as not to be sensible to the thermometer or to\r\n  the eye; and if light be only a modification of heat, or a\r\n  circumstance attending it, or a component part of the\r\n  inflammable air (hydrogen), then pure or dephlogisticated air\r\n  (oxygen) is composed of water deprived of its phlogiston\r\n  (hydrogen), and united to elementary heat.\"\r\n\r\n  [28] Those who desire to investigate this controversy more in\r\n  detail will find very full information on the subject in the\r\n  Translation of Arago's Eloge, with notes and appendix by J.

In the various modifications of the steam engine which we\r\nhave hitherto considered, the pressure introduced on one side of the\r\npiston derives its efficacy either wholly or partially from the\r\nvacuum produced by condensation on the other side. This always\r\nrequires a condensing apparatus, and a constant and abundant supply\r\nof cold water. An engine of this kind must therefore necessarily\r\nhave considerable dimensions and weight, and is inapplicable to uses\r\nin which a small and light machine only is admissible. If the\r\ncondensing apparatus be dispensed with, the piston will always be\r\nresisted by a force equal to the atmospheric [Pg322] pressure, and\r\nthe only part of the steam pressure which will be available as a\r\nmoving power, is that part by which it exceeds the pressure of the\r\natmosphere. Hence, in engines which do not work by condensation,\r\nsteam of a much higher pressure than that of the atmosphere is\r\nindispensably necessary, and such engines are therefore called\r\n_high-pressure engines_.\r\n\r\nWe are not, however, to understand that every engine, in which\r\nsteam is used of a pressure exceeding that of the atmosphere, is\r\nwhat is meant by an _high-pressure engine_; for in the ordinary\r\nengines in common use, constructed on Watt's principle, the\r\nsafety-valve is loaded with from 3 to 5 lbs. on the square inch;\r\nand in Woolf's engines, the steam is produced under a pressure of\r\n40 lbs. on the square inch. These would therefore be more properly\r\ncalled _condensing engines_ than _low-pressure engines_; a term\r\nquite inapplicable to those of Woolf. In fact, by _high-pressure\r\nengines_ is meant engines in which no vacuum is produced, and,\r\ntherefore, in which the piston works against a pressure equal to\r\nthat of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIn these engines the whole of the condensing apparatus, viz. the\r\ncold-water cistern, condenser, air-pump, cold-water pump, &c., are\r\ndispensed with, and nothing is retained except the boiler,\r\ncylinder, piston, and valves. Consequently, such an engine is\r\nsmall, light, and cheap. It is portable also, and may be moved, if\r\nnecessary, along with its load, and is therefore well adapted to\r\nlocomotive purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n(181.) High-pressure engines were one of the earliest forms of the\r\nsteam engine. The contrivance, which is obscurely described in the\r\narticle already quoted (7.), from the Century of Inventions, is a\r\nhigh-pressure engine; for the power there alluded to is the\r\nelastic force of steam working against the atmospheric pressure.\r\nNewcomen, in 1705, applied the working-beam, cylinder, and piston\r\nto the atmospheric engine; and Leupold, about 1720, combined the\r\nworking-beam and cylinder with the high-pressure principle, and\r\nproduced the earliest high-pressure engine worked by a cylinder\r\nand piston. The following is a description of Leupold's engine:—\r\n[Pg323]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 82.]\r\n\r\nA (_fig._ 82.) is the boiler, with the furnace beneath it; C C are\r\ntwo cylinders with solid pistons P P′, connected with the\r\nworking-beams B B′, to which are attached the pump-rods R R′, of\r\ntwo forcing pumps F F′, which communicate with a great force-pipe\r\nS; G is a _four-way cock_ (66.) already described. In the position\r\nin which it stands in the figure, the steam issues from below the\r\npiston P into the atmosphere, and the piston is descending by its\r\nown weight; steam from the boiler is at the same time pressing up\r\nthe piston P′, with a force equal to the difference between the\r\npressure of the steam and that of the atmosphere. Thus the piston\r\nR of the forcing-pump is being drawn up, and the piston P′ is\r\nforcing the piston R′ down, and thereby driving water into the\r\nforce-pipe [Pg324] S. On the arrival of the piston P at the\r\nbottom of the cylinder C, and P′ at the top of the cylinder C′,\r\nthe position of the cock is changed as represented in _fig._ 83.\r\nThe steam, which has just pressed up the piston P′, is allowed to\r\nescape into the atmosphere, while the steam, passing from the\r\nboiler below the piston P, presses it up, and thus P ascends by\r\nthe steam pressure, and P′ descends by its own weight. By these\r\nmeans the piston R is forced down, driving before it the water in\r\nthe pump-cylinder into the force-pipe S, and the piston R′ is\r\ndrawn up to allow the other pump-cylinder to be re-filled; and so\r\nthe process is continued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 83.]\r\n\r\nA valve is placed in the bottom of the force-pipes, to prevent the\r\nwater which has been driven into it from returning. This valve\r\nopens upwards; and, consequently, the weight of the water pressing\r\nupon it only keeps it more effectually closed. On each descent of\r\nthe piston, the pressure transmitted to the valve acting upwards\r\nbeing greater than the weight of the water resting upon it, forces\r\nit open, and an increased quantity of water is introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\n(182.) From the date of the improvement of Watt until the\r\ncommencement of the present century, non-condensing engines were\r\naltogether neglected in these countries. In the year 1802, Messrs.\r\nTrevethick and Vivian constructed the first non-condensing engine\r\nof this kind which was ever brought into extensive practical use\r\nin this kingdom. A section of this machine, made by a vertical\r\nplane, is represented in _fig._ 84.\r\n\r\nThe boiler A B is a cylinder with flat circular ends. The\r\nfire-place is constructed in the following manner:—A tube enters\r\nthe cylindrical boiler at one end; and, proceeding onwards near\r\nthe other extremity, is turned and recurved, so as to be carried\r\nback parallel to the direction in which it entered. It is thus\r\nconducted out of the boiler, at another part of the same end at\r\nwhich it entered. One of the ends of this tube communicates with\r\nthe chimney E, which is carried upwards as represented in the\r\nfigure. The other mouth is furnished [Pg325] with a door; and in\r\nit is placed the grate, which is formed of horizontal bars,\r\ndividing the tube into two parts; the upper part forming the\r\nfire-place, and the lower the ash-pit. The fuel is maintained in a\r\nstate of combustion, on the bars, in that part of the tube\r\nrepresented at C D; and the flame is carried by the draught of the\r\nchimney round the curved flue, and issues at E into the chimney.\r\nThe flame is thus conducted through the water, so as to expose the\r\nlatter to as much heat as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 84.]\r\n\r\nA section of the cylinder is represented at F, immersed in the\r\nboiler, except a few inches of the upper end, where the four-way\r\ncock G is placed for regulating the admission of the steam. A tube\r\nis represented at H, which leads from this four-way cock into the\r\nchimney; so that the waste steam, after working the piston, is\r\ncarried off through this tube, and passes into the chimney. The\r\nupper end of the piston-rod is furnished with a cross-bar, which\r\nis placed in a direction at right angles to the length of the\r\nboiler, and also to the [Pg326] piston-rod. This bar is guided in\r\nits motion by sliding on two iron perpendicular rods fixed to the\r\nsides of the boiler, and parallel to each other. To the ends of\r\nthis cross-bar are joined two connecting rods, the lower ends of\r\nwhich work two cranks fixed on an axis extending across and\r\nbeneath the boiler, and immediately under the centre of the\r\ncylinder. This axis is sustained in bearings formed in the legs\r\nwhich support the boiler, and upon its extremity is fixed the\r\nfly-wheel as represented at B. A large-toothed wheel is placed on\r\nthis axis; which, being turned with the cranked axle, communicates\r\nmotion to other wheels; and through them, to any machinery which\r\nthe engine may be applied to move.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 85.]\r\n\r\nAs the four-way cock is represented in the figure, the steam\r\npasses from the boiler through the curved passage G above the\r\npiston, while the steam below the piston is carried off through a\r\ntube which does not appear in the figure, by which it is conducted\r\nto the tube H, and thence to the chimney. The steam, therefore,\r\nwhich passes above the piston presses it downwards; while the\r\npressure upwards does not exceed that of the atmosphere. The\r\npiston will therefore descend with a force depending on the excess\r\nof the pressure of the steam produced in the boiler above the\r\natmospheric pressure. When the piston has arrived at the bottom of\r\nthe cylinder, the cock is made to assume the position represented\r\nin _fig._ 85. This effect is produced by the motion of the\r\npiston-rod. The steam now passes from above the piston, through\r\nthe tube H, into the chimney, while the steam from the boiler is\r\nconducted through another tube below the piston. The pressure\r\nabove the piston, in this case, does not exceed that of the\r\natmosphere; while the pressure below it will be that of the steam\r\nin the boiler. The piston will therefore ascend with the\r\ndifference of these pressures. On the arrival of the piston at the\r\ntop of the cylinder, the four-way cock is again turned to the\r\nposition represented in _fig._ 85., and the piston again descends;\r\nand in the same manner the process is continued. A safety-valve is\r\nplaced on the boiler at V, loaded with a weight W, proportionate\r\n[Pg327] to the strength of the steam with which it is proposed to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn the engines now described, this valve was frequently loaded at\r\nthe rate of from 60 to 80 lbs. on the square inch. As the boilers of\r\nhigh-pressure engines were considered more liable to accidents from\r\nbursting than those in which steam of a lower pressure was used,\r\ngreater precautions were taken against such effects. A second\r\nsafety-valve was provided, which was not left in the power of the\r\nengine-man. By this means he had a power to diminish the pressure of\r\nthe steam, but could not increase it beyond the limit determined by\r\nthe valve which was removed from his interference. The greatest\r\ncause of danger, however, arose from the water in the boiler being\r\nconsumed by evaporation faster than it was supplied; and therefore\r\nfalling below the level of the tube containing the furnace. To guard\r\nagainst accidents arising from this circumstance, a hole was bored\r\nin the boiler, at a certain depth, below which the water should not\r\nbe allowed to fall; and in this hole a plug of metal was soldered\r\nwith lead, or with some other metal, which would fuse at that\r\ntemperature which would expose the boiler to danger. Thus, in the\r\nevent of the water being exhausted, so that its level would fall\r\nbelow the plug, the heat of the furnace would immediately melt the\r\nsolder, and the plug would fall out, affording a vent for the steam,\r\nwithout allowing the boiler to burst. The mercurial steam-gauge,\r\nalready described, was also used as an additional security. When the\r\nforce of the steam exceeded the length of the column of mercury\r\nwhich the tube would contain, the mercury would be blown out, and\r\nthe tube would give vent to the steam. The water by which the boiler\r\nwas replenished was forced into it by a pump worked by the engine.\r\nIn order to economise the heat, this water was contained in a tube\r\nT, which surrounded the pipe H. As the waste steam, after working\r\nthe piston, passed off through H, it imparted a portion of its heat\r\nto the water contained in the tube T, which was thus warmed to a\r\ncertain temperature before it was forced into the boiler by the\r\npump. Thus a part of the heat, which was originally [Pg328] carried\r\nfrom the boiler in the form of steam, was returned again to the\r\nboiler with the water with which it was fed.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that engines constructed in this manner may be\r\napplied to all the purposes to which the condensing engines are\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n(183.) Two years after the date of the patent of this engine, its\r\ninventor constructed a machine of the same kind for the purpose of\r\nmoving carriages on railroads; and applied it successfully, in the\r\nyear 1804, on the railroad at Merthyr Tydvil, in South Wales. It\r\nwas in principle the same as that already described. The cylinder\r\nhowever was in a horizontal position, the piston-rod working in\r\nthe direction of the line of road: the extremity of the\r\npiston-rod, by means of a connecting rod, worked cranks placed on\r\nthe axletree, on which were fixed two cogged wheels: these worked\r\nin others, by which their motion was communicated finally to\r\ncogged wheels fixed on the axle of the hind wheels of the\r\ncarriage, by which this axle was kept in a state of revolution.\r\nThe hind wheels being fixed on the axletree, and turning with it,\r\nwere caused likewise to revolve; and so long as the weight of the\r\ncarriage did not exceed that which the friction of the road was\r\ncapable of propelling, the carriage would thus be moved forwards.\r\nOn this axle was placed a fly-wheel to continue the rotatory\r\nmotion at the termination of each stroke. The fore wheels are\r\ndescribed as being capable of turning like the fore wheels of a\r\ncarriage, so as to guide the vehicle. The projectors appear to\r\nhave contemplated, in the first instance, the use of this carriage\r\non common roads; but that notion seems to have been abandoned, and\r\nits use was only adopted on the railroad before mentioned. On the\r\noccasion of its first trial, it drew after it as many carriages as\r\ncontained ten tons of iron a distance of nine miles; which stage\r\nit performed without any fresh supply of water, and travelled at\r\nthe rate of five miles an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n(184.) Capital and skill have of late years been directed with\r\nextraordinary energy to the improvement of inland transport; and\r\nthis important instrument of national wealth and civilisation has\r\nreceived a proportionate impulse. Effects are now witnessed,\r\nwhich, had they been narrated a few years [Pg329] since, could\r\nonly have been admitted into the pages of fiction or volumes of\r\nromance. Who could have credited the possibility of a ponderous\r\nengine of iron, loaded with some hundred passengers, in a train of\r\ncarriages of corresponding magnitude, and a large quantity of\r\nwater and coal, taking flight from Manchester and arriving at\r\nLiverpool, a distance of above thirty miles, in little more than\r\nan hour? And yet this is a matter of daily and almost hourly\r\noccurrence. The rapidity of transport thus attained is not less\r\nwonderful than the weights transported. Its capabilities in this\r\nrespect far transcend the exigencies even of the two greatest\r\ncommercial marts in Great Britain. Loads, varying from fifty to\r\none hundred and fifty tons, are transported at the average rate of\r\nfifteen miles an hour; and in one instance we have seen a load—we\r\nshould rather say a _cargo_—of waggons, conveying merchandise to\r\nthe amount of two hundred and thirty tons gross, transported from\r\nLiverpool to Manchester at the average rate of twelve miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nThe astonishment with which such performances must be viewed,\r\nmight be qualified, if the art of transport by steam on railways\r\nhad been matured, and had attained that full state of perfection\r\nwhich such an art is always capable of receiving from long\r\nexperience, aided by great scientific knowledge, and the unbounded\r\napplication of capital. But such is not the present case. The art\r\nof constructing locomotive engines, so far from having attained a\r\nstate of maturity, has not even emerged from its infancy. So\r\ncomplete was the ignorance of its powers which prevailed, even\r\namong engineers, previous to the opening of the Liverpool railway,\r\nthat the transport of heavy goods was regarded as the chief object\r\nof the undertaking, and its principal source of revenue. The\r\nincredible speed of transport, effected even in the very first\r\nexperiments in 1830, burst upon the public, and on the scientific\r\nworld, with all the effect of a new and unlooked-for phenomenon.\r\nOn the unfortunate occasion which deprived this country of Mr.\r\nHuskisson, the wounded body of that statesman was transported a\r\ndistance of about fifteen miles in twenty-five minutes, being at\r\nthe rate of thirty-six miles an hour. The revenue of the road\r\narising from passengers since its opening, [Pg330] has, contrary\r\nto all that was foreseen, been nearly double that which has been\r\nderived from merchandise. So great was the want of experience in\r\nthe construction of engines, that the company was at first\r\nignorant whether they should adopt large steam engines fixed at\r\ndifferent stations on the line, to pull the carriages from station\r\nto station, or travelling engines to drag the loads the entire\r\ndistance. Having decided on the latter, they have, even to the\r\npresent moment, laboured under the disadvantage of the want of\r\nthat knowledge which experience alone can give. The engines have\r\nbeen constantly varied in their weight and proportions, in their\r\nmagnitude and form, as the experience of each successive month has\r\nindicated. As defects became manifest they were remedied;\r\nimprovements suggested were adopted; and each year produced\r\nengines of such increased power and efficiency, that their\r\npredecessors were abandoned, not because they were worn out, but\r\nbecause they had been outstripped in the rapid march of\r\nimprovement. Add to this, that only one species of travelling\r\nengine has been effectively tried; the capabilities of others\r\nremain still to be developed; and even that form of engine which\r\nhas received the advantage of a course of experiments on so grand\r\na scale to carry it towards perfection, is far short of this\r\npoint, and still has defects, many of which, it is obvious, time\r\nand experience will remove.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the locomotive engine, subject thus to all the\r\nimperfections inseparable from a novel contrivance—with the\r\nrestrictions on the free application of skill and capital, arising\r\nfrom the nature of the monopolies granted to railway companies—with\r\nthe disadvantage of very limited experience, the great parent of\r\npractical improvement, having been submitted to experiments hitherto\r\nonly on a limited scale, and confined almost to one form of\r\nmachine;—if, under such disadvantages, such effects have been\r\nproduced as are now daily witnessed by the public, what may not be\r\nlooked for from this extraordinary power when the enterprise of the\r\ncountry shall be more unfettered—when greater fields of experience\r\nare opened—when time, ingenuity, and capital have removed or\r\ndiminished existing imperfections, and have brought to light new and\r\nmore powerful principles? This is not mere speculation [Pg331] on\r\nabstract possibilities, but refers to what is in actual progress.\r\nThe points of greatest wealth and population—the centres of largest\r\ncapital and most active industry throughout the country—will soon\r\nbe connected by lines of railway; and various experiments are\r\nproposed, with more or less prospect of success, for the application\r\nof steam engines on stone roads where the intercourse is not\r\nsufficient to render railways profitable.\r\n\r\nThe important commercial and political effects attending such\r\nincreased facility and speed in the transport of persons and goods,\r\nare too obvious to require any very extended notice here. A part of\r\nthe price (and in many cases a considerable part) of every article\r\nof necessity or luxury, consists of the cost of transporting it from\r\nthe producer to the consumer; and consequently every abatement or\r\nsaving in this cost must produce a corresponding reduction in the\r\nprice of every article transported; that is to say, of every thing\r\nwhich is necessary for the subsistence of the poor, or for the\r\nenjoyment of the rich—of every comfort, and of every luxury of\r\nlife. The benefit of this will extend, not to the consumer only, but\r\nto the producer: by lowering the expense of transport of the\r\nproduce, whether of the soil or of the loom, a less quantity of that\r\nproduce will be spent in bringing the remainder to market, and\r\nconsequently a greater surplus will reward the labour of the\r\nproducer. The benefit of this will be felt even more by the\r\nagriculturist than by the manufacturer; because the proportional\r\ncost of transport of the produce of the soil is greater than that of\r\nmanufactures. If two hundred quarters of corn be necessary to raise\r\nfour hundred, and one hundred more be required to bring the four\r\nhundred to market, then the net surplus will be one hundred. But if\r\nby the use of steam carriages the same quantity can be brought to\r\nmarket with an expenditure of fifty quarters, then the net surplus\r\nwill be increased from one hundred to one hundred and fifty\r\nquarters; and either the profit of the farmer, or the rent of the\r\nlandlord, must be increased by the same amount.\r\n\r\nBut the agriculturist would not merely be benefited by an\r\nincreased return from the soil already under cultivation. Any\r\n[Pg332] reduction in the cost of transporting the produce to\r\nmarket would call into cultivation tracts of inferior fertility,\r\nthe returns from which would not at present repay the cost of\r\ncultivation and transport. Thus land would become productive which\r\nis now waste, and an effect would be produced equivalent to adding\r\nso much fertile soil to the present extent of the country. It is\r\nwell known, that land of a given degree of fertility will yield\r\nincreased produce by the increased application of capital and\r\nlabour. By a reduction in the cost of transport, a saving will be\r\nmade which may enable the agriculturist to apply to tracts already\r\nunder cultivation the capital thus saved, and thereby increase\r\ntheir actual production. Not only, therefore, would such an effect\r\nbe attended with an increased extent of cultivated land, but also\r\nwith an increased degree of cultivation in that which is already\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, that in Great Britain there are above a million\r\nof horses engaged in various ways in the transport of passengers\r\nand goods, and that to transport each horse requires as much land\r\nas would, upon an average, support eight men. If this quantity of\r\nanimal power were displaced by steam engines, and the means of\r\ntransport drawn from the bowels of the earth, instead of being\r\nraised upon its surface, then, supposing the above calculation\r\ncorrect, as much land would become available for the support of\r\nhuman beings as would suffice for an additional population of\r\neight millions; or, what amounts to the same, would increase the\r\nmeans of support of the present population by about one third of\r\nthe present available means. The land which now supports horses\r\nfor transport would then support men, or produce corn for food.\r\n\r\nThe objection that a quantity of land exists in the country\r\ncapable of supporting horses alone, and that such land would be\r\nthrown out of cultivation, scarcely deserves notice here. The\r\nexistence of any considerable quantity of such land is extremely\r\ndoubtful. What is the soil which will feed a horse and not feed\r\noxen or sheep, or produce food for man? But even if it be admitted\r\nthat there exists in the country a small portion of such land,\r\nthat portion cannot exceed, nor indeed equal, what would be\r\nsufficient for the number of horses [Pg333] which must after all\r\ncontinue to be employed for the purposes of pleasure, and in a\r\nvariety of cases where steam must necessarily be inapplicable. It\r\nis to be remembered, also, that the displacing of horses in one\r\nextensive occupation, by diminishing their price must necessarily\r\nincrease the demand for them in others.\r\n\r\nThe reduction in the cost of transport of manufactured articles,\r\nby lowering their price in the market, will stimulate their\r\nconsumption. This observation applies of course not only to home\r\nbut to foreign markets. In the latter we already in many branches\r\nof manufactures command a monopoly. The reduced price which we\r\nshall attain by cheapness and facility of transport will still\r\nfurther extend and increase our advantages. The necessary\r\nconsequence will be, an increased demand for manufacturing\r\npopulation; and this increased population again reacting on the\r\nagricultural interests, will form an increased market for that\r\nspecies of produce. So interwoven and complicated are the fibres\r\nwhich form the texture of the highly civilised and artificial\r\ncommunity in which we live, that an effect produced on any one\r\npoint is instantly transmitted to the most remote and apparently\r\nunconnected parts of the system.\r\n\r\nThe two advantages of increased cheapness and speed, besides\r\nextending the amount of existing traffic, call into existence new\r\nobjects of commercial intercourse. For the same reason that the\r\nreduced cost of transport, as we have shown, calls new soils into\r\ncultivation, it also calls into existence new markets for\r\nmanufactured and agricultural produce. The great speed of transit\r\nwhich has been proved to be practicable, must open a commerce\r\nbetween distant points in various articles, the nature of which\r\ndoes not permit them to be preserved so as to be fit for use\r\nbeyond a certain time. Such are, for example, many species of\r\nvegetable and animal food, which at present are confined to\r\nmarkets at a very limited distance from the grower or feeder. The\r\ntruth of this observation is manifested by the effects which have\r\nfollowed the intercourse by steam on the Irish Channel. The\r\nwestern towns of England have become markets for a prodigious\r\nquantity of Irish produce, which it had been previously [Pg334]\r\nimpossible to export. If animal food be transported alive from the\r\ngrower to the consumer, the distance of the market is limited by\r\nthe power of the animal to travel, and the cost of its support on\r\nthe road. It is only particular species of cattle which bear to be\r\ncarried to market on common roads and by horse carriages. But the\r\npeculiar nature of a railway, the magnitude and weight of the\r\nloads which may be transported on it, and the prodigious speed\r\nwhich may be attained, render the transport of cattle, of every\r\nspecies, to almost any distance, both easy and cheap. In process\r\nof time, when the railway system becomes extended, the metropolis\r\nand populous towns will therefore become markets, not as at\r\npresent to districts within limited distances of them, but to the\r\nwhole country.\r\n\r\nThe moral and political consequences of so great a change in the\r\npowers of transition of persons and intelligence from place to place\r\nare not easily calculated. The concentration of mind and exertion\r\nwhich a great metropolis always exhibits, will be extended in a\r\nconsiderable degree to the whole realm. The same effect will be\r\nproduced as if all distances were lessened in the proportion in\r\nwhich the speed and cheapness of transit are increased. Towns at\r\npresent removed some stages from the metropolis, will become its\r\nsuburbs; others, now at a day's journey, will be removed to its\r\nimmediate vicinity; business will be carried on with as much ease\r\nbetween them and the metropolis, as it is now between distant points\r\nof the metropolis itself. Let those who discard speculations like\r\nthese as wild and improbable, recur to the state of public opinion,\r\nat no very remote period, on the subject of steam navigation. Within\r\nthe memory of persons who have not yet passed the meridian of life,\r\nthe possibility of traversing by the steam engine the channels and\r\nseas that surround and intersect these islands, was regarded as the\r\ndream of enthusiasts. Nautical men and men of science rejected such\r\nspeculations with equal incredulity, and with little less than scorn\r\nfor the understanding of those who could for a moment entertain\r\nthem. Yet we have witnessed steam engines traversing not these\r\nchannels and seas alone, but sweeping the face of the waters round\r\nevery coast in Europe. The [Pg335] seas which interpose between our\r\nAsiatic dominions and Egypt, and those which separate our own shores\r\nfrom our West Indian possessions, have offered an equally\r\nineffectual barrier to its powers, and the establishment of a\r\nregular steam communication between the capitals of the Old and New\r\nWorld has ceased to be a question of practicability, having become\r\nmerely one of commercial profit. If steam be not used as the only\r\nmeans of connecting the most distant points of our planet, it is not\r\nbecause it is inadequate to the accomplishment of that end, but\r\nbecause the supply of the material, from which at the present moment\r\nit derives its powers, is restricted by local and accidental\r\ncircumstances.[30]\r\n\r\nWe propose in the present chapter to lay before our readers some\r\naccount of the means whereby the effects above referred to have\r\nbeen produced; of the manner and degree in which the public have\r\navailed themselves of these means; and of the improvements of\r\nwhich they seem to us to be susceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n(185.) It is a singular fact, that in the history of this\r\ninvention considerable time and great ingenuity were vainly\r\nexpended in attempting to overcome a difficulty, which in the end\r\nturned out to be purely imaginary. To comprehend distinctly the\r\nmanner in which a wheel carriage is propelled by steam, suppose\r\nthat a pin or handle is attached to the spoke of the wheel at some\r\ndistance from its centre, and that a force is applied to this pin\r\nin such a manner as to make the wheel revolve. If the tire of the\r\nwheel and the surface of the road were absolutely smooth and free\r\nfrom friction, so that the face of the tire would slide without\r\nresistance upon the road, then the effect of the force thus\r\napplied would be merely to cause the wheel to turn round, the\r\ncarriage being stationary, the surface of the tire slipping or\r\nsliding upon the road as the wheel is made to revolve. But if, on\r\nthe other hand, the pressure of the face of the tire upon the road\r\nis such as to produce between them such a degree of adhesion as\r\nwill render it impossible for the wheel to slide or slip upon the\r\nroad by [Pg336] the force which is applied to it, the consequence\r\nwill be, that the wheel can only turn round in obedience to the\r\nforce which moves it by causing the carriage to advance, so that\r\nthe wheel will roll upon the road, and the carriage will be moved\r\nforward, through a distance equal to the circumference of the\r\nwheel, each time it performs a complete revolution.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that both of these effects may be partially produced;\r\nthe adhesion of the wheel to the road may be insufficient to prevent\r\nslipping altogether, and yet it may be sufficient to prevent the\r\nwheel from slipping as fast as it revolves. Under such circumstances\r\nthe carriage would advance and the wheel would slip. The progressive\r\nmotion of the carriage during one complete revolution of the wheel\r\nwould be equal to the difference between the complete circumference\r\nof the wheel and the portion through which in one revolution it has\r\nslipped.\r\n\r\nWhen the construction of travelling steam engines first engaged\r\nthe attention of engineers, and for a considerable period\r\nafterwards, a notion was impressed upon their minds that the\r\nadhesion between the face of the wheel and the surface of the road\r\nmust necessarily be of very small amount, and that in every\r\npractical case the wheels thus driven would either slip\r\naltogether, and produce no advance of the carriage, or that a\r\nconsiderable portion of the impelling power would be lost by the\r\npartial slipping or sliding of the wheels. It is singular that it\r\nshould never have occurred to the many ingenious persons who for\r\nseveral years were engaged in such experiments and speculations,\r\nto ascertain by experiment the actual amount of adhesion in any\r\nparticular case between the wheels and the road. Had they done so,\r\nwe should probably now have found locomotive engines in a more\r\nadvanced state than that to which they have attained.\r\n\r\nTo remedy this imaginary difficulty, Messrs. Trevethick and Vivian\r\nproposed to make the external rims of the wheels rough and uneven,\r\nby surrounding them with projecting heads of nails or bolts, or by\r\ncutting transverse grooves on them. They proposed, in cases where\r\nconsiderable elevations were to be ascended, to cause claws or\r\nnails to project from the surface during the ascent, so as to take\r\nhold of the road. [Pg337]\r\n\r\nIn seven years after the construction of the first locomotive\r\nengine by these engineers, another locomotive engine was\r\nconstructed by Mr. Blinkensop, of Middleton Colliery, near Leeds.\r\nHe obtained a patent, in 1811, for the application of a rack-rail.\r\nThe railroad thus, instead of being composed of smooth bars of\r\niron, presented a line of projecting teeth, like those of a\r\ncog-wheel, which stretched along the entire distance to be\r\ntravelled. The wheels on which the engine rolled were furnished\r\nwith corresponding teeth, which worked in the teeth of the\r\nrailroad, and, in this way, produced a progressive motion in the\r\ncarriage.\r\n\r\nThe next contrivance for overcoming this fictitious difficulty,\r\nwas that of Messrs. Chapman, who, in the year 1812, obtained a\r\npatent for working a locomotive engine by a chain extending along\r\nthe middle of the line of railroad, from the one end to the other.\r\nThis chain was passed once round a grooved wheel under the centre\r\nof the carriage; so that, when this grooved wheel was turned by\r\nthe engine, the chain being incapable of slipping upon it, the\r\ncarriage was consequently advanced on the road. In order to\r\nprevent the strain from acting on the whole length of the chain,\r\nits links were made to fall upon upright forks placed at certain\r\nintervals, which between those intervals sustained the tension of\r\nthe chain produced by the engine. Friction-rollers were used to\r\npress the chain into the groove of the wheel, so as to prevent it\r\nfrom slipping. This contrivance was soon abandoned, for the very\r\nobvious reason that a prodigious loss of force was incurred by the\r\nfriction of the chain.\r\n\r\nThe following year, 1813, produced a contrivance of singular\r\ningenuity, for overcoming the supposed difficulty arising from the\r\nwant of adhesion between the wheels and the road. This was no\r\nother than a pair of mechanical legs and feet, which were made to\r\nwalk and propel in a manner somewhat resembling the feet of an\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 86.]\r\n\r\nA sketch of these propellers is given in _fig._ 86. A is the\r\ncarriage moving on the railroad, L and L′ are the legs, F and F′\r\nthe feet. The foot F has a joint at O, which corresponds to the\r\nankle; another joint is placed at K, which corresponds to the\r\nknee; and a third is placed at L, which corresponds to [Pg338]\r\nthe hip. Similar joints are placed at the corresponding letters in\r\nthe other leg. The knee-joint K is attached to the end of the\r\npiston of the cylinder. When the piston, which is horizontal, is\r\npressed outwards, the leg L presses the foot F against the ground,\r\nand the resistance forces the carriage A onwards. As the carriage\r\nproceeds, the angle K at the knee becomes larger, so that the leg\r\nand thigh take a straighter position; and this continues until the\r\npiston has reached the end of its stroke. At the hip L there is a\r\nshort lever L M, the extremity of which is connected by a cord or\r\nchain with a point S, placed near the shin of the leg. When the\r\npiston is pressed into the cylinder, the knee K is drawn towards\r\nthe engine, and the cord M S is made to lift the foot F from the\r\nground; to which it does not return until the piston has arrived\r\nat the extremity of the cylinder. On the piston being again driven\r\nout of the cylinder, the foot F, being placed on the road, is\r\npressed backwards by the force of the piston-rod at K; but the\r\nfriction of the ground preventing its backward motion, the\r\nre-action causes the engine to advance: and in the same manner\r\nthis process is continued.\r\n\r\nAttached to the thigh at N, above the knee, by a joint, is a\r\nhorizontal rod N R, which works a rack R. This rack has beneath it\r\na cog-wheel. This cog-wheel acts in another rack below it. By\r\nthese means, when the knee K is driven _from_ the engine, the rack\r\nR is moved _backwards_; but the cog-wheel acting on the other rack\r\nbeneath it, will move the latter _in the contrary direction_. The\r\nrack R being then moved _in the_ [Pg339] _same direction with the\r\nknee_ K, it follows that the other rack will always be moved _in a\r\ncontrary direction_. The lower rack is connected by another\r\nhorizontal rod with the thigh of the leg L F′, immediately above\r\nthe knee at N′. When the piston is forced _inwards_, the knee K′\r\nwill thus be forced _backwards_; and when the piston is forced\r\n_outwards_, the knee K′ will be drawn _forwards_. It therefore\r\nfollows, that the two knees K and K′ are pressed _alternately\r\nbackwards_ and _forwards_. The foot F′, when the knee K′ is drawn\r\nforward, is lifted by the means already described for the foot F.\r\n\r\nIt will be apparent, from this description, that the piece of\r\nmechanism here exhibited is a contrivance derived from the motion\r\nof the legs of an animal, and resembling in all respects the fore\r\nlegs of a horse. It is however to be regarded rather as a specimen\r\nof great ingenuity than as a contrivance of practical utility.\r\n\r\n\r\n(186.) It was about this period that the important fact was first\r\nascertained that the adhesion or friction of the wheels with the\r\nrails on which they moved was amply sufficient to propel the\r\nengine, even when dragging after it a load of great weight; and\r\nthat in such case, the progressive motion would be effected\r\nwithout any slipping of the wheels. The consequence of this fact\r\nrendered totally useless all the contrivances for giving wheels a\r\npurchase on the road, such as racks, chains, feet, &c. The\r\nexperiment by which this was determined appears to have been first\r\ntried on the Wylam railroad; where it was proved, that when the\r\nroad was level, and the rails clean, the adhesion of the wheels\r\nwas sufficient, in all kinds of weather, to propel considerable\r\nloads. By manual labour it was first ascertained how much weight\r\nthe wheels of a common carriage would overcome without slipping\r\nround on the rail, and having found the proportion which that bore\r\nto the weight, they then ascertained that the weight of the engine\r\nwould produce sufficient adhesion to drag after it on the railroad\r\nthe requisite number of waggons.[31]\r\n\r\nIn 1814, an engine was constructed at Killingworth, by Mr.\r\nStephenson, having two cylinders with a cylindrical [Pg340]\r\nboiler, and working two pair of wheels, by cranks placed at right\r\nangles; so that when the one was in full operation, the other was\r\nat its dead points. By these means the propelling power was always\r\nin action. The cranks were maintained in this position by an\r\nendless chain, which passed round two cogged wheels placed under\r\nthe engine, and which were fixed on the same axles on which the\r\nwheels were placed. The wheels in this case were fixed on the\r\naxles, and turned with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 87.]\r\n\r\nThis engine is represented in _fig._ 87., the sides being open, to\r\nrender the interior mechanism visible. A B is the cylindrical\r\nboiler; C C are the working cylinders; D E are the cogged wheels\r\nfixed on the axle of the wheels of the engine, and surrounded by\r\nthe endless chain. These wheels being equal in magnitude, perform\r\ntheir revolutions in the same time; so that, when the crank F\r\ndescends to the lowest point, the crank G rises from the lowest\r\npoint to the horizontal position D; and, again, when the crank F\r\nrises from the lowest point to the horizontal position E, the\r\nother crank rises to the highest point; and so on. A very\r\nbeautiful contrivance was adopted in this engine, by which it was\r\nsuspended on springs of steam. Small cylinders, represented at H,\r\nare screwed by flanges to one side of the boiler, and project\r\nwithin it a few inches; they have free communication at the top\r\nwith the water or steam of the boiler. Solid pistons are\r\nrepresented at I, which move steam-tight in these [Pg341]\r\ncylinders; the cylinders are open at the bottom, and the\r\npiston-rods are screwed on the carriage of the engine, over the\r\naxle of each pair of wheels, the pistons being presented upwards.\r\nAs the engine is represented in the figure, it is supported on\r\nfour pistons, two at each side. The pistons are pressed upon by\r\nthe water or steam which occupies the upper chamber of the\r\ncylinder; and the latter being elastic in a high degree, the\r\nengine has all the advantage of spring suspension. The defect of\r\nthis method of supporting the engine is, that when the steam loses\r\nthat amount of elasticity necessary for the support of the\r\nmachine, the pistons are forced into the cylinders, and the\r\nbottoms of the cylinders bear upon them. All spring suspension is\r\nthen lost. This mode of suspension has consequently since been\r\nlaid aside.\r\n\r\nIn an engine subsequently constructed by Mr. Stephenson, for the\r\nKillingworth railroad, the mode adopted of connecting the wheels\r\nby an endless chain and cog-wheels was abandoned; and the same\r\neffect was produced by connecting the two cranks by a straight\r\nrod. All such contrivances, however, have this great defect, that,\r\nif the fore and hind wheels be not constructed with dimensions\r\naccurately equal, there must necessarily be a slipping or dragging\r\non the road. The nature of the machinery requires that each wheel\r\nshould perform its revolution exactly in the same time; and\r\nconsequently, in doing so, must pass over exactly equal lengths of\r\nthe road. If, therefore, the circumference of the wheels be not\r\naccurately equal, that wheel which has the lesser circumference\r\nmust be dragged along so much of the road as that by which it\r\nfalls short of the circumference of the greater wheel; or, on the\r\nother hand, the greater wheel must be dragged in the opposite\r\ndirection, to compensate for the same difference. As no mechanism\r\ncan accomplish a perfect equality in four, much less in six,\r\nwheels, it may be assumed that a great portion of that dragging\r\neffect is a necessary consequence of the principle of this\r\nmachine; and even were the wheels, in the first instance,\r\naccurately constructed, it is not possible that their wear could\r\nbe so exactly uniform as to continue equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n(187.) The next stimulus which the progress of this [Pg342]\r\ninvention received, proceeded from the great national work\r\nundertaken at Liverpool, by which that town and the extensive\r\ncommercial mart of Manchester were connected by a double line of\r\nrailway. When this project was undertaken, it was not decided what\r\nmoving power it might be most expedient to adopt as a means of\r\ntransport on the proposed road: the choice lay between horse\r\npower, fixed steam engines, and locomotive engines; but the first,\r\nfor many obvious reasons, was at once rejected in favour of one or\r\nother of the last two.\r\n\r\nThe steam engine may be applied, by two distinct methods, to move\r\nwaggons either on a turnpike road or on a railway. By the one\r\nmethod the steam engine is fixed, and draws the carriage or train\r\nof carriages towards it by a chain extending the whole length of\r\nroad on which the engine works. By this method the line of road\r\nover which the transport is conducted is divided into a number of\r\nshort intervals, at the extremity of each of which an engine is\r\nplaced. The waggons or carriages, when drawn by any engine to its\r\nown station, are detached, and connected with the extremity of the\r\nchain worked by the next stationary engine; and thus the journey\r\nis performed, from station to station, by separate engines. By the\r\nother method the same engine draws the load the whole journey,\r\ntravelling with it.\r\n\r\nThe Directors of the Liverpool and Manchester railroad, when that\r\nwork was advanced towards its completion, employed, in the spring\r\nof the year 1829, Messrs. Stephenson and Lock, and Messrs. Walker\r\nand Rastrick, experienced engineers, to visit the different\r\nrailways, where practical information respecting the comparative\r\neffects of stationary and locomotive engines was likely to be\r\nobtained; and from these gentlemen they received reports on the\r\nrelative merits, according to their judgment of the two methods.\r\nThe particulars of their calculations are given at large in the\r\nvaluable work of Mr. Nicholas Wood on railways; to which we refer\r\nthe reader, not only on this, but on many other subjects connected\r\nwith the locomotive steam engine, into which it would be foreign\r\nto our object to enter. The result of the comparison of the two\r\nsystems was, that the capital [Pg343] necessary to be advanced to\r\nestablish a line of stationary engines was considerably greater\r\nthan that which was necessary to establish an equivalent power in\r\nlocomotive engines; that the annual expense by the stationary\r\nengines was likewise greater; and that, consequently, the expense\r\nof transport by the latter was greater, in a like proportion. The\r\nsubjoined table exhibits the results numerically:—\r\n\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n                     |               |               |  Expense of\r\n                     |               |               |   taking a\r\n                     |               |   Annual      | Ton of Goods\r\n                     |    Capital.   |   Expense.    |    a Mile.\r\n  ——————————————————-+——————————————-+——————————————-+—————————————\r\n                     |     £   s.  d.|   £     s.  d.|\r\n  Locomotive engines |  58,000  0  0 | 25,517   8  2 |  0·164 penny\r\n  Stationary engines | 121,496  7  0 | 42,031  16  5 |  0·269\r\n                     |——————————————-+——————————————-+—————————————\r\n  Locomotive system  |               |               |\r\n             less    |  63,496  7  0 | 16,514   8  3 |  0·105\r\n  ——————————————————-+——————————————-+——————————————-+—————————————\r\n\r\nOn the score of economy, therefore, the system of locomotive\r\nengines was entitled to a preference; but there were other\r\nconsiderations which conspired with this to decide the choice of\r\nthe Directors in its favour. An accident occurring in any part of\r\na road worked by stationary engines must necessarily produce a\r\ntotal suspension of work along the entire line. The most vigilant\r\nand active attention on the part of every workman, however\r\nemployed, in every part of the line, would therefore be necessary;\r\nbut, independently of this, accidents arising from the fracture or\r\nderangement of any of the chains, or from the suspension of the\r\nworking of any of the fixed engines, would be equally injurious,\r\nand would effectually stop the intercourse along the line. On the\r\nother hand, in locomotive engines an accident could only affect\r\nthe particular train of carriages drawn by the engine to which the\r\naccident might occur; and even then the difficulty could be\r\nremedied by having a supply of spare engines at convenient\r\nstations along the line. It is true that the _probability_ of\r\naccident is, perhaps, less in the stationary than in the\r\nlocomotive system; but the _injurious consequences_, when accident\r\n_does_ happen, are prodigiously greater in the former. \"The one\r\nsystem,\" says Mr. Walker, \"is like a chain extending from\r\nLiverpool to Manchester, the failure [Pg344] of a single link of\r\nwhich would destroy the whole; while the other is like a number of\r\nshort and unconnected chains,\" the destruction of any one of which\r\ndoes not interfere with the effect of the others, and the loss of\r\nwhich may be supplied with facility.\r\n\r\nThe decision of the Directors was, therefore, in favour of\r\nlocomotive engines; and their next measure was to devise some\r\nmeans by which the inventive genius of the country might be\r\nstimulated to supply them with the best possible form of engines\r\nfor this purpose. With this view, it was proposed and carried into\r\neffect to offer a prize for the best locomotive engine which might\r\nbe produced under certain proposed conditions, and to appoint a\r\ntime for a public trial of the claims of the candidates. A premium\r\nof five hundred pounds was accordingly offered for the best\r\nlocomotive engine to run on the Liverpool and Manchester railway;\r\nunder the condition that it should produce no smoke; that the\r\npressure of the steam should be limited to fifty pounds on the\r\ninch; and that it should draw at least three times its own weight,\r\nat the rate of not less than ten miles an hour; that the engine\r\nshould be supported on springs, and should not exceed fifteen feet\r\nin height. Precautions were also proposed against the consequences\r\nof the boiler bursting; and other matters not necessary to mention\r\nmore particularly here. This proposal was announced in the spring\r\nof 1829, and the time of trial was appointed in the following\r\nOctober. The engines which underwent the trial were, the Rocket,\r\nconstructed by Mr. Stephenson; the Sanspareil, by Hackworth; and\r\nthe Novelty, by Messrs. Braithwaite and Ericson. Of these, the\r\nRocket obtained the premium. A line of railway was selected for\r\nthe trial, on a level piece of road about two miles in length,\r\nnear a place called Rainhill, between Liverpool and Manchester;\r\nthe distance between the two stations was a mile and a half, and\r\nthe engine had to travel this distance backwards and forwards ten\r\ntimes, which made altogether a journey of thirty miles. The Rocket\r\nperformed this journey twice: the first time in 2 hours 14 minutes\r\nand 8 seconds; and the second time in 2 hours 6 minutes and 49\r\nseconds. Its speed at different parts of the journey varied: its\r\ngreatest rate of motion was [Pg345] rather above 29 miles an\r\nhour; and its least, about 11-1/2 miles an hour. The average rate\r\nof the one journey was 13-4/10 miles an hour; and of the other,\r\n14-2/20 miles. This was the only engine which performed the\r\ncomplete journey proposed, the others having been stopped from\r\naccidents which occurred to them in the experiment. The Sanspareil\r\nperformed the distance between the stations eight times,\r\ntravelling 22-1/2 miles in 1 hour 37 minutes and 16 seconds. The\r\ngreatest velocity to which this engine attained was something less\r\nthan 23 miles per hour. The Novelty had only passed twice between\r\nthe stations when the joints of the boiler gave way, and put an\r\nend to the experiment.\r\n\r\n\r\n(188.) The great object to be attained in the construction of\r\nthese engines was, to combine with sufficient lightness the\r\ngreatest possible heating power. The fire necessarily acts on the\r\nwater in two ways: first, by its radiant heat; and second, by the\r\ncurrent of heated air which is carried by the draught through the\r\nflues, and finally passes into the chimney. To accomplish this\r\nobject, therefore, it is necessary to expose to both these sources\r\nof heat the greatest possible quantity of surface in contact with\r\nthe water. These ends were attained by the following admirable\r\narrangement in the Rocket:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 88.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 89.]\r\n\r\nThis engine is represented in _fig._ 88. It is supported on four\r\nwheels; the principal part of the weight being thrown on one pair,\r\nwhich are worked by the engine. The boiler consists of a cylinder\r\nsix feet in length, with flat ends; the chimney issues from one\r\nend, and to the other end is attached a square box B, the bottom\r\nof which is furnished with the grate on which the fuel is placed.\r\nThis box is composed of two casings of iron, one contained within\r\nthe other, having between them a space about three inches in\r\nbreadth; the magnitude of the box being three feet in length, two\r\nfeet in width, and three feet in depth. The casing which surrounds\r\nthe box communicates with the lower part of the boiler by a pipe\r\nmarked C; and the same casing at the top of the box communicates\r\nwith the upper part of the boiler by another pipe marked D. When\r\nwater is admitted into the boiler, therefore, it flows freely,\r\nthrough the pipe C, into the casing which [Pg346] surrounds the\r\nfurnace or fire-box, and fills this casing to the same level as\r\nthat which it has in the boiler. When the engine is at work, the\r\nboiler is kept about half filled with water; and, consequently,\r\nthe casing surrounding the furnace is completely filled. The steam\r\nwhich is generated in the water contained in the casing finds its\r\nexit through the pipe D, and escapes into the upper part of the\r\nboiler. A section of the engine, taken at right angles to its\r\nlength, is represented at _fig._ 89. Through the lower part of the\r\nboiler pass a number of copper tubes of small size, which\r\ncommunicate at one end with the fire-box, and at the other with\r\nthe chimney, and form a passage for the heated air from the\r\nfurnace to the chimney. The ignited fuel spread on the grate at\r\nthe bottom of the fire-box disperses its heat by radiation, and\r\nacts in this manner on the whole surface of the casing surrounding\r\nthe fire-box; and thus raises the temperature of the thin shell of\r\nwater contained in that casing. The chief [Pg347] part of the\r\nwater in the casing, being lower in its position than the water in\r\nthe boiler, acquires a tendency to ascend when heated, and passes\r\ninto the boiler; so that a constant circulation of the heated\r\nwater is maintained, and the water in the boiler must necessarily\r\nbe kept at nearly the same temperature as the water in the casing.\r\nThe air which passes through the burning fuel, and which fills the\r\nfire-box, is carried by the draught through the tubes which extend\r\nthrough the lower part of the boiler; and as these tubes are\r\nsurrounded on every side with the water contained in the boiler,\r\nthis air transmits its heat through these tubes to the water. It\r\nfinally issues into the chimney, and rises by the draught. The\r\npower of this furnace must necessarily depend on the power of\r\ndraught in the chimney; and to increase this, and at the same time\r\nto dispose of the waste steam after it has worked the piston, this\r\nsteam is carried off by a pipe L, which passes from the cylinder\r\nto the chimney, and escapes there in a jet which is turned\r\nupwards. By the velocity with which it issues from this jet, and\r\nby its great comparative levity, it produces a strong current\r\nupwards in the chimney, and thus gives force to the draught of the\r\nfurnace. In _fig._ 89. the grate-bars are represented at the\r\nbottom of the fire-box at F. There are two cylinders, one of which\r\nworks each wheel; one only appearing in the drawing _fig._ 88.,\r\nthe other being concealed by the engine. The spokes which these\r\ncylinders work are placed at right angles on the wheels; the\r\nwheels being fixed on a common axle, with which they turn.\r\n\r\nIn this engine, the surface of water surrounding the fire-box,\r\nexposed to the action of radiant heat, amounted to twenty square\r\nfeet, which received heat from the surface of six square feet of\r\nburning fuel on the bars. The surface exposed to the action of the\r\nheated air amounted to 118 square feet. The engine drew after it\r\nanother carriage, containing fuel and water; the fuel used was\r\ncoke, for the purpose of avoiding the production of smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n(189.) The Sanspareil of Mr. Hackworth is represented in _fig._\r\n90.; the horizontal section being exhibited in _fig._ 91.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 90.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 91.]\r\n\r\nThe draught of the furnace is produced in the same manner as in\r\nthe Rocket, by ejecting the waste steam coming from [Pg348] the\r\ncylinder into the chimney; the boiler, however, differs\r\nconsiderably from that of the Rocket. A recurved tube passes\r\nthrough the boiler, somewhat similar to that already described in\r\nthe early engine of Messrs. Trevethick and Vivian. In the\r\nhorizontal section (_fig._ 91.), D expresses the opening of the\r\nfurnace at the end of the boiler, beside the chimney. The\r\ngrate-bars appear at A, supporting the burning fuel; and a curved\r\ntube passing through the boiler, and terminating in the chimney,\r\nis expressed at B, the direction [Pg349] of the draught being\r\nindicated by the arrow; C is a section of the chimney. The\r\ncylinders are placed, as in the Rocket, on each side of the\r\nboiler; each working a separate wheel, but acting on spokes placed\r\nat right angles to each other. The tube in which the grate and\r\nflue are placed diminishes in diameter as it approaches the\r\nchimney. At the mouth where the grate was placed, its diameter was\r\ntwo feet; and it was gradually reduced, so that, at the chimney,\r\nits diameter was only fifteen inches. The grate-bars extended five\r\nfeet into the tube. The surface of water exposed to the radiant\r\nheat of the fire was sixteen square feet; and that exposed to the\r\naction of the heated air and flame was about seventy-five square\r\nfeet. The magnitude of the grate, or sheet of burning fuel which\r\nradiated heat, was ten square feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n(190.) The Novelty, of Messrs. Braithwaite and Ericson, is\r\nrepresented in _fig._ 92.; and a section of the generator and\r\nboiler is exhibited in _fig._ 93.; the corresponding parts in the\r\ntwo figures are marked by the same letters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 92.]\r\n\r\nA is the generator or receiver containing the steam which works\r\nthe engine; this communicates with a lower generator B, which\r\nextends in a horizontal direction the entire length of the\r\ncarriage. Within the generator A is contained the furnace F, which\r\ncommunicates in a tube C, carried up through the generator, and\r\nterminated at the top by sliding shutters, which exclude the air,\r\nand which are only opened to supply fuel to the grate F. Below the\r\ngrate the furnace is not open, as usual, to the atmosphere, but\r\ncommunicates, [Pg350] by a tube E, with a bellows D; which is\r\nworked by the engine, and which forces a constant stream of air,\r\nby the tube E, through the fuel on F, so as to keep that fuel in\r\nvivid combustion. The heated air contained in the furnace F is\r\ndriven on, by the same force, through a small curved tube marked\r\n_e_, which circulates like a worm (as represented in _fig._ 93.)\r\nthrough the horizontal generator or receiver; and, tapering\r\ngradually, until reduced to very small dimensions, it finally\r\nissues into the chimney G. The air in passing along this tube,\r\nimparts its heat to the water by which the tube is surrounded, and\r\nis brought to a considerably reduced temperature when discharged\r\ninto the chimney. The cylinder, which is represented at K, works\r\none pair of wheels, by means of a bell-crank, the other pair, when\r\nnecessary, being connected with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 93.]\r\n\r\nIn this engine, the magnitude of the surface of burning fuel on\r\nthe grate-bars is less than two square feet; the surface exposed\r\nto radiant heat is nine and a half square feet; and the surface of\r\nwater exposed to heated air is about thirty-three square feet.\r\n\r\nThe superiority of the Rocket may be attributed chiefly to the\r\ngreater quantity of surface of the water which is exposed to the\r\naction of the fire. With a less extent of grate-bars than the\r\nSanspareil, in the proportion of three to five, it exposes a\r\ngreater surface of water to radiant heat, in the proportion of\r\nfour to three; and a greater surface of water to heated air, in\r\nthe proportion of more than three to two. It was found that\r\nthe Rocket, compared with the Sanspareil, consumed fuel, in\r\nthe evaporation of a given quantity of water, [Pg351] in the\r\nproportion of eleven to twenty-eight. The suggestion of using the\r\ntubes to conduct through the water the heated air to the chimney\r\nis due to Mr. Booth, treasurer of the Liverpool and Manchester\r\nRailway Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n(191.) The object to be effected in the boilers of these engines\r\nis, to keep a small quantity of water at an excessive temperature,\r\nby means of a small quantity of fuel kept in the most active state\r\nof combustion. To accomplish this, it is necessary, first, so to\r\nshape the boiler, furnace, and flues, that the water shall be in\r\ncontact with as extensive a surface as possible, every part of\r\nwhich is acted on, either immediately, by the heat radiating from\r\nthe fire, or mediately, by the air which has passed through the\r\nfire, and which finally rushes into the chimney: and, secondly,\r\nthat such a forcible draught should be maintained in the furnace,\r\nthat a quantity of heat shall be extricated from the fuel, by\r\ncombustion, sufficient to maintain the water at the necessary\r\ntemperature, and to produce the steam with sufficient rapidity. To\r\naccomplish these objects, therefore, the chamber containing the\r\ngrate should be completely surrounded by water, and should be\r\nbelow the level of the water in the boiler. The magnitude of the\r\nsurface exposed to radiation should be as great as is consistent\r\nwith the whole magnitude of the machine. The comparative advantage\r\nwhich the Rocket possessed in these respects over the other\r\nengines will be evident on inspection. In the next place, it is\r\nnecessary that the heat, which is absorbed by the air passing\r\nthrough the fuel, and keeping it in a state of combustion, should\r\nbe transferred to the water before the air escapes into the\r\nchimney. Air being a bad conductor of heat, to accomplish this it\r\nis necessary that the air in the flues should be exposed to as\r\ngreat an extent of surface in contact with the water as possible.\r\nNo contrivance can be less adapted for the attainment of this end\r\nthan one or two large tubes traversing the boiler, as in the\r\nearliest locomotive engines: the body of air which passed through\r\nthe centre of these tubes had no contact with their surface, and,\r\nconsequently, passed into the chimney at nearly the same\r\ntemperature as that which it had when it quitted the fire. The\r\nonly portion of air which imparted its heat to the water [Pg352]\r\nwas that portion which passed next to the surface of the tube.\r\n\r\nSeveral methods suggest themselves to increase the surface of\r\nwater in contact with a given quantity of air passing through it.\r\nThis would be accomplished by causing the air to pass between\r\nplates placed near each other, so as to divide the current into\r\nthin strata, having between them strata of water, or it might be\r\nmade to pass between tubes differing slightly in diameter, the\r\nwater passing through an inner tube, and being also in contact\r\nwith the external surface of the outer tube. Such a method would\r\nbe similar in principle to the steam-jacket used in Watt's steam\r\nengines, or to the condenser of Cartwright's engine already\r\ndescribed. But, considering the facility of constructing small\r\ntubes, and of placing them in the boiler, that method, perhaps,\r\nis, on the whole, the best in practice; although the shape of a\r\ntube, geometrically considered, is most unfavourable for the\r\nexposure of a fluid contained in it to its surface. The air which\r\npasses from the fire-chamber, being subdivided as it passes\r\nthrough the boiler by a great number of very small tubes, may be\r\nmade to impart all its excess of heat to the water before it\r\nissues into the chimney. This is all which the most refined\r\ncontrivance can effect. The Rocket engine was traversed by\r\ntwenty-five tubes, each three inches in diameter; and the\r\nprinciple has since been carried to a much greater extent.\r\n\r\nThe abstraction of a great quantity of heat from the air before it\r\nreaches the chimney is attended with one consequence, which, at\r\nfirst view, would present a difficulty apparently insurmountable;\r\nthe chimney would, in fact, lose its power of draught. This\r\ndifficulty, however, was removed by using the waste steam, which\r\nhad passed from the cylinder after working the engine, for the\r\npurpose of producing a draught. This steam was urged through a jet\r\npresented upwards in the chimney, and driven out with such force\r\nin that direction as to create a sufficient draught to work the\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the principle of draught in the Novelty\r\nis totally distinct from this: in that engine the draught is\r\nproduced by a bellows worked by the engine. The question, as far\r\nas relates to these two methods, is, whether more power [Pg353]\r\nis lost in supplying the steam through the jet, as in the Rocket,\r\nor in working the bellows, as in the Novelty. The force requisite\r\nto impel the steam through the jet must be exerted by the\r\nreturning stroke of the piston, and, consequently, must rob the\r\nworking effect to an equivalent amount. On the other hand, the\r\npower requisite to work the bellows in the Novelty must be\r\nsubducted from the available power of the engine. The former\r\nmethod has been hitherto found to be the more effectual and\r\neconomical.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these details will be understood, when it is\r\nconsidered that the only limit to the attainment of speed by\r\nlocomotive engines is the power to produce, in a given time, a\r\ncertain quantity of steam. Each stroke of the piston causes one\r\nrevolution of the wheels, and consumes four cylinders full of\r\nsteam: consequently, a cylinder of steam corresponds to a certain\r\nnumber of feet of road travelled over: hence it is that the\r\nproduction of a rapid and abundant supply of heat, and the\r\nimparting of that heat quickly and effectually to the water, is\r\nthe key to the solution of the problem to construct an engine\r\ncapable of rapid motion.\r\n\r\nThe method of subdividing the flue into tubes was carried much\r\nfurther by Mr. Stephenson after the construction of the Rocket;\r\nand, indeed, the principle was so obvious, it is only surprising\r\nthat, in the first instance, tubes of smaller diameter than three\r\ninches were not used. In engines since constructed, the number of\r\ntubes vary from ninety to one hundred and twenty, the diameter\r\nbeing reduced to two inches or less; and in some instances tubes\r\nhave been introduced, even to the number of one hundred and fifty,\r\nof one and a half inch diameter. In the Meteor, twenty square feet\r\nare exposed to radiation, and one hundred and thirty-nine to the\r\ncontact of heated air; in the Arrow, twenty square feet to\r\nradiation, and one hundred and forty-five to the contact of heated\r\nair. The superior economy of fuel gained by this means will be\r\napparent by inspecting the following table, which exhibits the\r\nconsumption of fuel which was requisite to convey a ton weight a\r\nmile in each of four engines, expressing also the rate of the\r\nmotion:— [Pg354]\r\n\r\n  ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n                    |  Average Rate of   | Consumption of Coke\r\n        Engines.    | Speed in Miles per |  in Pounds per Ton\r\n                    |       Hour.        |       per Mile.\r\n  ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n  No. 1.

Since the period at which this railway was opened for the\r\nactual purposes of transport, the locomotive engines have been in\r\na state of progressive improvement. Scarcely a month has passed\r\nwithout suggesting some change in the details, by which fuel might\r\nbe economised, the production of steam rendered more rapid, the\r\nwear of the engine rendered slower, the proportionate strength of\r\nthe different parts improved, or some other desirable end\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nEngines constructed in the form of the Rocket, were subject to two\r\nprincipal defects. The cylinders, being placed outside the engine,\r\nwere exposed to the cold of the atmosphere, which produced a waste\r\nof heat more or less considerable by condensation. The points at\r\nwhich the power of the steam to turn the wheels was applied, being\r\nat the extremities of the axle and on the exterior of the wheel, a\r\nconsiderable strain was produced, owing to the distance of the\r\npoint of application of the power from the centre of resistance.\r\nIf it were possible that the impelling power could act in drawing\r\nthe train at all times with equal energy on both sides of the\r\nengine, then no injurious strain would be produced; but from the\r\nrelative position of the points on the opposite wheels to which it\r\nwas necessary to attach the connecting rods, it was inevitable\r\nthat, at the moment when one of the pistons exerts its full power\r\nin driving the wheel, the other piston must be altogether\r\ninactive. The impelling power, therefore, at alternate moments of\r\ntime, acted on opposite wheels, and on each of them at the\r\ngreatest possible distance from the centre of the axle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 94.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(193.) The next step in the improvement of the machine was made\r\nwith a view to remove these two defects. The cylinders were\r\ntransferred from the exterior of the engine to the [Pg355]\r\ninterior of the casing called the smoke-box, B, _fig._ 94., which\r\nsupports the chimney, and which receives the heated air issuing\r\nfrom the tubes which traverse the boiler. Thus placed, the\r\ncylinders are always maintained as hot as the air which issues\r\nfrom the flues, and all condensation of steam by their exposure is\r\nprevented. The piston-rods are likewise brought closer together,\r\nand nearer the centre of the engine: the connecting rods, no\r\nlonger attached to the wheels, are made to act upon two cranks\r\nconstructed upon the axle of the wheels, and placed at right\r\nangles to each other. From the position of these cranks, one would\r\nalways be at its dead point when the other is in full action. The\r\naction of the steam upon them would, therefore, be generally\r\nunequal; but this would not produce the same strain as when the\r\nconnecting rods are attached to points upon the exterior of the\r\nwheels, owing to the cranks being constructed on the axle at\r\npoints so much nearer its centre. By this means it was found that\r\nthe working of the machine was more even, and productive of much\r\nless strain, than in the arrangement adopted in the Rocket, and\r\nthe earlier engines. On the other hand, a serious disadvantage was\r\nincurred by a double-cranked axle. The weakness necessarily\r\narising from such a form of axle could only be removed by great\r\nthickness [Pg356] and weight of metal; and even this precaution,\r\nat first, did not prevent their occasional fracture. The forging\r\nof them was, however, subsequently much improved: the cranks,\r\ninstead of being formed by bending the metal when softened by\r\nheat, were made by cutting the square of the crank out of the\r\nsolid metal; and now it rarely happens that one of these axles\r\nfails.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of smaller tubes, and a greater number of them, with\r\na view more perfectly to extract the heat from the air in passing\r\nto the chimney, rendered a more forcible draft necessary. This was\r\naccomplished by the adoption of a more contracted blast-pipe\r\nleading from the eduction-pipes of the cylinders and presented up\r\nthe chimney. A representation of such a blast-pipe, with the two\r\ntubes leading from the cylinders and uniting together near the\r\npoint, which is presented up the chimney, is given at _p p_ in\r\n_fig._ 104. The engine thus improved is represented in _fig._ 94.\r\n\r\nA represents the cylindrical boiler, the lower half of which is\r\ntraversed by tubes, as described in the Rocket. They are usually\r\nfrom eighty to one hundred in number, and about an inch and a half\r\nin diameter; the boiler is about seven feet in length; the\r\nfire-chamber is attached to one end of it, at F, as in the Rocket,\r\nand similar in construction: the cylinders are inserted in a\r\nchamber at the other end, immediately under the chimney. The\r\npiston-rods are supported in the horizontal position by guides;\r\nand connecting rods extend from them, under the engine, to the two\r\ncranks placed on the axle of the large wheels. The effects of an\r\ninequality in the road are counteracted by springs, on which the\r\nengine rests; the springs being below the axle of the great\r\nwheels, and above that of the less. The steam is supplied to the\r\ncylinders, and withdrawn, by means of the common sliding valves,\r\nwhich are worked by an eccentric wheel placed on the axle of the\r\nlarge wheels of the carriage. The motion is communicated from this\r\neccentric wheel to the valve by sliding rods. The stand is placed\r\nfor the attendant at the end of the engine, next the fire-place F;\r\nand two levers L project from the end which communicate with the\r\nvalves by means of rods, by which the engine is governed so as to\r\nreverse the motion. [Pg357]\r\n\r\nThe wheels of these engines have been commonly constructed of wood\r\nwith strong iron ties, furnished with flanges adapted to the\r\nrails. But Mr. Stephenson afterward substituted, in some\r\ninstances, wheels of iron with hollow spokes. The engine draws\r\nafter it a tender carriage containing the fuel and water; and,\r\nwhen carrying a light load, is capable of performing the whole\r\njourney from Liverpool to Manchester without a fresh supply of\r\nwater. When a heavy load of merchandise is drawn, it is usual to\r\ntake in water at the middle of the trip.\r\n\r\n\r\n(194.) In reviewing all that has been stated, it will be perceived\r\nthat the efficiency of the locomotive engines used on this railway\r\nis mainly owing to three circumstances: 1st, The unlimited power\r\nof draft in the furnace, by projecting the waste steam into the\r\nchimney; 2d, The almost unlimited abstraction of heat from the air\r\npassing from the furnace, by arrangement of tubes traversing the\r\nboiler; and, 3d, Keeping the cylinders warm, by immersing them in\r\nthe chamber under the chimney. There are many minor details which\r\nmight be noticed with approbation, but these constitute the main\r\nfeatures of the improvements.\r\n\r\nThe successive introduction of improvements in the engines, some\r\nof which we have mentioned, was accompanied by corresponding\r\naccessions to their practical power, and to the economy of fuel.\r\nIn the spring of the year 1832, I made several experiments on the\r\nManchester Railway, with a view to determine, in the actual state\r\nof the locomotive engines at that time, their powers with respect\r\nto the amount of load and the economy of fuel, from which I select\r\nthe following as examples:—\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.\r\n\r\n  On Saturday, the 5th of May, the engine called the \"Victory\"\r\n  took 20 waggons of merchandise, weighing gross 92 tons 19 cwt.\r\n  1 qr., together with the tender containing fuel and water, of\r\n  the weight of which I have no account, from Liverpool to\r\n  Manchester (30 miles), in 1 h. 34 min. 45 sec. The train\r\n  stopped to take in water half-way, for 10 minutes, [Pg358]\r\n  not included in the above-mentioned time. On the inclined\r\n  plane rising 1 in 96, and extending 1-1/2 mile, the engine was\r\n  assisted by another engine called the \"Samson,\" and the ascent\r\n  was performed in 9 minutes. At starting, the fire-place was\r\n  well filled with coke, and the coke supplied to the tender\r\n  accurately weighed. On arriving at Manchester, the fire-place\r\n  was again filled, and the coke remaining in the tender\r\n  weighed. The consumption was found to amount to 929 pounds net\r\n  weight, being at the rate of one third of a pound per ton per\r\n  mile.\r\n\r\n  Speed on the level was 18 miles an hour; on a fall of 4 feet\r\n  in a mile, 21-1/2 miles an hour; fall of 6 feet in a mile,\r\n  25-1/2 miles an hour; on the rise over Chatmoss, 8 feet in a\r\n  mile, 17-5/8 miles an hour; on level ground sheltered from the\r\n  wind, 20 miles an hour. The wind was moderate, but direct\r\n  ahead. The working wheels slipped three times on Chatmoss, and\r\n  the train was retarded from 2 to 3 minutes.\r\n\r\n  The engine, on this occasion, was not examined before or after\r\n  the journey, but was presumed to be in good working order.\r\n\r\n\r\n  II.\r\n\r\n  On Tuesday, the 8th of May, the same engine performed the same\r\n  journey, with 20 waggons, weighing gross 90 tons 7 cwt. 2\r\n  qrs., exclusive of the unascertained weight of the tender. The\r\n  time of the journey was 1 h. 41 min. The consumption of coke\r\n  1040 lbs. net weight, estimated as before. Rate of speed:—\r\n\r\n  Level                       17-5/8 miles per hour.\r\n  Fall of 4 feet in a mile    22\r\n  ——      6                   22-1/2\r\n  Rise of 8                   15\r\n\r\n  On this occasion there was a high wind ahead on the quarter,\r\n  and the connecting rod worked hot, owing to having been keyed\r\n  too tight. On arriving at Manchester, I caused the cylinders\r\n  to be opened, and found that the pistons were [Pg359] so\r\n  loose, that the steam blew through the cylinders with great\r\n  violence. By this cause, therefore, the machine was robbed of\r\n  a part of its power during the journey; and this circumstance\r\n  may explain the slight decrease in speed, and increase in the\r\n  consumption of fuel, with a lighter load, in this journey,\r\n  compared with that performed on the 5th of May.\r\n\r\n  The Victory weighs 8 tons 2 cwt., of which 5 tons 4 cwt. rest\r\n  on the drawing wheels. The cylinders are 11 inches diameter,\r\n  and 16 inches stroke, and the diameter of the drawing wheels\r\n  is 5 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  III.\r\n\r\n  On the 29th of May, the engine called the \"Samson\" (weighing\r\n  10 tons 2 cwt., with 14-inch cylinders, and 16-inch stroke;\r\n  wheels 4 feet 6 inches diameter, both pairs being worked by\r\n  the engine; steam 50 lbs. pressure, 130 tubes) was attached to\r\n  50 waggons, laden with merchandise; net weight about 150 tons;\r\n  gross weight, including waggons, 223 tons 6 cwt. The tender\r\n  weighed 7 tons, making a gross load (including the engine) of\r\n  240 tons 8 cwt. The engine with this load travelled from\r\n  Liverpool to Manchester (30 miles) in 2 hours and 40 min.,\r\n  exclusive of delays upon the road for watering, &c.; being at\r\n  the rate of nearly 12 miles an hour. The speed varied\r\n  according to the inclinations of the road. Upon a level, it\r\n  was 12 miles an hour; upon a descent of 6 feet in a mile, it\r\n  was 16 miles an hour; upon a rise of 8 feet in a mile, it was\r\n  about 9 miles an hour. The weather was calm, the rails very\r\n  wet; but the wheels did not slip, even in the slowest speed,\r\n  except at starting, the rails being at that place soiled and\r\n  greasy with the slime and dirt to which they are always\r\n  exposed at the stations. The coke consumed in this journey,\r\n  exclusive of what was raised in getting up the steam, was 1762\r\n  lbs., being at the rate of a quarter of a pound per ton per\r\n  mile.\r\n\r\n\r\n(195.) The great original cost, and the heavy expense of keeping\r\nthe engines used on the railway in repair, have pressed severely\r\non the resources of the undertaking. One of the best [Pg360]\r\nconstructed of the later engines costs originally 1500_l._ and\r\nsometimes more. The original cost, however, is far from being the\r\nprincipal source of expense: the wear and tear of these machines,\r\nand the occasional fracture of those parts on which the greatest\r\nstrain has been laid, have greatly exceeded what the directors had\r\nanticipated. Although this source of expense must be in part\r\nattributed to the engines not having yet attained that state of\r\nperfection, in the proportion and adjustment of their parts, of\r\nwhich they are susceptible, and to which experience alone can\r\nlead, yet there are some obvious defects which demand attention.\r\n\r\nThe heads of the boilers are flat, and formed of iron, similar to\r\nthe material of the boilers themselves. The tubes which traverse\r\nthe boiler were, until recently, copper, and so inserted into the\r\nflat head or end as to be water-tight. When the boiler was heated,\r\nthe tubes were found to expand in a greater degree than the other\r\nparts of the boiler; which frequently caused them either to be\r\nloosened at the extremities, so as to cause leakage, or to bend\r\nfrom want of room for expansion. The necessity of removing and\r\nrefastening the tubes caused, therefore, a constant expense.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that the fire-place is situated at one end\r\nof the boiler, immediately below the mouths of the tubes: a\r\npowerful draft of air, passing through the fire, carries with it\r\nashes and cinders, which are driven violently through the tubes,\r\nand especially the lower ones, situated near the fuel. These tubes\r\nare, by this means, subject to rapid wear, the cinders continually\r\nacting upon their interior surface. After a short time it becomes\r\nnecessary to replace single tubes, according as they are found to\r\nbe worn, by new ones; and it not unfrequently happens, when this\r\nis neglected, that tubes burst. After a certain length of time the\r\nengines require new tubing. This wear of the tubes might possibly\r\nbe avoided by constructing the fire-place in a lower position, so\r\nas to be more removed from their mouths; or, still more\r\neffectually, by interposing a casing of metal, which might be\r\nfilled with water, between the fire-place and those tubes which\r\nare the most exposed to the cinders and ashes. The unequal\r\nexpansion of the tubes [Pg361] and boilers appears to be an\r\nincurable defect, if the present form of the engine be retained.\r\nIf the fire-place and chimney could be placed at the same end of\r\nthe boiler, so that the tubes might be recurved, the unequal\r\nexpansion would then produce no injurious effect; but it would be\r\ndifficult to clean the tubes, if they were exposed, as they are at\r\npresent, to the cinders. The next source of expense arises from\r\nthe wear of the boiler-heads, which are exposed to the action of\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\nA considerable improvement was subsequently introduced into the\r\nmethod of tubing, by substituting brass for copper tubes. I am not\r\naware that the cause of this improvement has been discovered; but\r\nit is certain, whatever be the cause, that brass tubes are subject\r\nto considerably slower wear than copper ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n(196.) The expense of locomotive power having so far exceeded what\r\nwas anticipated at the commencement of the undertaking, it was\r\nthought advisable, about the beginning of the year 1834, to\r\ninstitute an inquiry into the causes which produced the\r\ndiscrepancy between the estimated and actual expenses, with a view\r\nto the discovery of some practical means by which they could be\r\nreduced. The directors of the company, for this purpose, appointed\r\na sub-committee of their own body, assisted by Mr. Booth, their\r\ntreasurer, to inquire and report respecting the causes of the\r\namount of this item of their expenditure, and to ascertain whether\r\nany and what measures could be devised for the attainment of\r\ngreater economy. A very able and satisfactory report was made by\r\nthis committee, or, to speak more correctly, by Mr. Booth.\r\n\r\nIt appears that, previous to the establishment of the railway,\r\nMessrs. Walker and Rastrick, engineers, were employed by the\r\ncompany to visit various places where steam power was applied on\r\nrailways, for the purpose of forming an estimate of the probable\r\ncomparative expense of working the railway by locomotive and by\r\nfixed power. These engineers recommended the adoption of\r\nlocomotive power; and their estimate was, that the transport might\r\nbe effected at the rate of ·278 of a penny, or very little more\r\nthan a farthing per ton per mile. In the year [Pg362] 1833, five\r\nyears after this investigation took place, it was found that the\r\nactual cost was ·625 of a penny, or something more than a\r\nhalfpenny, per ton per mile, being considerably above double the\r\nestimated rate. Mr. Booth very properly directed his inquiries to\r\nascertain the cause of this discrepancy, by comparing the various\r\ncircumstances assumed by Messrs. Walker and Rastrick, in making\r\ntheir estimate, with those under which the transport was actually\r\neffected. The first point of difference which he observed was the\r\n_speed_ of transport: the estimate was founded on an assumed speed\r\nof ten miles an hour, and it was stated that a four-fold speed\r\nwould require an addition of 50 per cent. to the power, without\r\ntaking into account wear and tear. Now, the actual speed of\r\ntransport being double the speed assumed in the statement, Mr.\r\nBooth holds it to be necessary to add 25 per cent. on that score.\r\n\r\nThe next point of difference is in the amount of the loads: the\r\nestimate is founded upon the assumption, that every engine shall\r\nstart with its full complement of load, and that with this it\r\nshall go the whole distance. \"The facts, however, are,\" says Mr.\r\nBooth, \"that, instead of a _full load_ of profitable carriage\r\n_from_ Manchester, about half the waggons _come back empty_; and,\r\ninstead of the tonnage being conveyed the whole way, many thousand\r\ntons are conveyed only half the way; also, instead of the daily\r\nwork being uniform, it is extremely fluctuating.\" It is further\r\nremarked, that in order to accomplish the transport of goods from\r\nthe branches and from intermediate places, engines are despatched\r\nseveral times a-day, from both ends of the line, _to clear the\r\nroad_; the object of this arrangement being rather to lay the\r\nfoundation of a beneficial intercourse in future, than with a view\r\nto any immediate profit. Mr. Booth makes a rough estimate of the\r\ndisadvantages arising from these circumstances, by stating them at\r\n33 per cent. in addition to the original estimate.\r\n\r\nThe next point of difference is the fuel. In the original\r\nestimate, _coal_ is assumed as the fuel, and it is taken at the\r\nprice of five shillings and ten-pence per ton: now the act of\r\nparliament forbids the use of coal which would produce smoke; the\r\ncompany have, therefore, been obliged to use _coke_, at [Pg363]\r\nseventeen shillings and sixpence a ton.[32] Taking coke, then, to\r\nbe equivalent to coal, ton for ton, this would add ·162 to the\r\noriginal estimate.\r\n\r\nThese several discrepancies being allowed for, and a proportional\r\namount being added to the original estimate, the amount would be\r\nraised to ·601 of a penny per ton per mile, which is within one\r\nfortieth of a penny of the actual cost. This difference is\r\nconsidered to be sufficiently accounted for by the wear and tear\r\nproduced by the very rapid motion, more especially when it is\r\nconsidered that many of the engines were constructed before the\r\nengineer was aware of the great speed that would be required.\r\n\r\n\"What, then,\" says Mr. Booth, in the Report already alluded to, \"is\r\nthe result of these opposite and mutually counteracting\r\ncircumstances? and what is the present position of the company in\r\nrespect of their moving power? Simply, that they are still in a\r\ncourse of experiment, to ascertain practically the best\r\nconstruction, and the most durable materials, for engines required\r\nto transport greater weights, and at greater velocities, than had,\r\ntill very recently, been considered possible; and which, a few years\r\nago, it had not entered into the imagination of the most daring and\r\nsanguine inventor to conceive: and farther, that these experiments\r\nhave necessarily been made, not with the calm deliberation and quiet\r\npace which a salutary caution recommends,—making good each step in\r\nthe progress of discovery before advancing another stage,—but\r\namidst the bustle and responsibilities of a large and increasing\r\ntraffic; the directors being altogether ignorant of the time each\r\nengine would last before it would be laid up as inefficient, but\r\ncompelled to have engines, whether good or bad; being aware of\r\nvarious defects and imperfections, which it was impossible at the\r\ntime to remedy, yet obliged to keep the machines in motion, under\r\nall the disadvantages of heavy repairs, constantly going on during\r\nthe night, in order that the requisite number of engines might be\r\nready for the morning's work. Neither is this great experiment yet\r\ncomplete; it is still going forward. But the most prominent\r\ndifficulties have been in a great measure surmounted, [Pg364] and\r\nyour committee conceive that they are warranted in expecting, that\r\nthe expenditure in this department will, ere long, be materially\r\nreduced,—more especially when they consider the relative\r\nperformances of the engines at the _present time_, compared with\r\nwhat it was two years ago.\"\r\n\r\nIn the half year ending 31st December, 1831, the six best engines\r\nperformed as follows:—\r\n\r\n                  Miles.\r\n  Planet           9,986\r\n  Mercury         11,040\r\n  Jupiter         11,618\r\n  Saturn          11,786\r\n  Venus           12,850\r\n  Etna             8,764\r\n                  ——————\r\n  Making in all   66,044\r\n                  ——————\r\n\r\nIn the half year ending 31st December, 1833, the six best engines\r\nperformed as follows:—\r\n\r\n                   Miles.\r\n  Jupiter          16,572\r\n  Saturn           18,678\r\n  Sun              14,552\r\n  Etna             17,763\r\n  Ajax             11,678\r\n  Firefly          15,608\r\n                   ——————\r\n  Making in all    95,851\r\n                   ——————\r\n\r\n\r\n(197.) Since the date to which the preceding observations refer,\r\nthe locomotive engine has undergone several improvements in detail\r\nof considerable importance; among which, the addition of a third\r\npair of wheels deserves to be particularly mentioned. An engine\r\nsupported on three pair of wheels has great security in the event\r\nof the fracture of any one of the axles,—the remaining axles and\r\nwheels being sufficient for the support of the machine. Connected\r\nwith this change is another, recommended by Mr. Robert Stephenson,\r\nby which the flanges are removed from the driving wheels, those\r\nupon the remaining pairs of wheels being sufficient to keep the\r\nengine in its position upon the rails. We shall now describe a\r\nlocomotive engine similar in construction to those almost [Pg365]\r\nuniversally used at present on railroads, as well in this kingdom\r\nas in other countries.[33]\r\n\r\nThe external appearance of the engine and tender is shown in the\r\nengraving at the head of this chapter. In _fig._ 97. is exhibited\r\na vertical section of the engine made by a plane carried through\r\nits length; and in _fig._ 98. is exhibited a corresponding section\r\nof its tender,—the tender being supposed to be joined on to the\r\nengine at the part where the connecting points appear to be broken\r\nin the drawing. In _fig._ 99. is exhibited the plan of the working\r\nmachinery, including the cylinders, pistons, eccentrics, &c. which\r\nare under the boiler, by the operation of which the engine is\r\ndriven. _Fig._ 100. represents the tender, also taken in plan.\r\n\r\nIn _fig._ 101. is represented an elevation of the hinder end of\r\nthe engine next the fire-box; and in _fig._ 102. is represented a\r\ncross vertical section through the fire-box, and at right angles\r\nto the length of the engine, showing the interior of the boiler\r\nabove and beside the fire-box, the rivets and bolts connecting the\r\ninternal and external fire-boxes, the regulator, steam funnel, and\r\nsteam dome.\r\n\r\nIn _fig._ 103. is represented an elevation of the front of the\r\nengine next the smoke-box, showing the cylinder covers W, buffers\r\nT, &c.; and in _fig._ 104. is represented a section of the\r\ninterior of the smoke-box, made by a vertical plane at right\r\nangles to the engine, showing the tube plate forming the foremost\r\nend of the boiler, the branches S of the steam-pipe leading to the\r\ncylinders, the blast-pipe _p_, the cylinders H, and the chimney G.\r\n\r\nThe same letters of reference are placed at corresponding parts in\r\nthe different figures.\r\n\r\nThe boiler, as has been explained in the engines already\r\ndescribed, is a cylinder placed upon its side, the section of\r\nwhich is exhibited at A, _fig._ 97. The fire-box consists of two\r\ncasings of metal, one within the other. The fire-grate is\r\nrepresented at D. The tubes by which the products of combustion\r\nare [Pg366] drawn from the fire-box to the smoke-box F are\r\nrepresented at E. Upon the smoke-box is erected the chimney G. In\r\nthe engine from which this drawing has been taken, and which was\r\nused on the London and Birmingham Railway, the boiler is a\r\ncylinder 7-1/2 feet long, and 3-1/2 feet in diameter. It is formed\r\nof wrought-iron plates 5/16 of an inch in thickness, overlapping\r\neach other, and bound together by iron rivets 7/8 of an inch in\r\ndiameter and 1-3/4 inch apart. One of these rivets, as it joins\r\ntwo plates, is represented in _fig._ 95. The boiler is clothed\r\nwith a boarding of wood _a_, an inch in thickness, and bound round\r\nby iron hoops screwed together at the bottom. Wood being a slow\r\nconductor of heat, this covering has the effect of keeping the\r\nboiler warm, and checking the condensation of steam which would\r\notherwise be produced by the rapid motion of the engine through\r\nthe cold air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 95.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 96.]\r\n\r\nThe external fire-box, B B, is a casing nearly square in its plan,\r\nbeing four feet wide outside, and three feet seven and a half\r\ninches long, measured in the direction of the boiler. It is\r\nconstructed of wrought-iron plates, similar to those of the\r\nboiler. This box descends about two feet below the boiler, the top\r\nbeing semi-cylindrical, as seen in _fig._ 102., of a somewhat\r\ngreater diameter than the boiler, and concentrical with it. The\r\nfront of the fire-box next the end of the boiler has a circular\r\nopening equal in size to the end of the boiler. To the edge of\r\nthis opening the boiler is fastened by angle irons, and rivets in\r\nthe manner represented in _fig._ 96. These rivets are seen in\r\nsection in _fig._ 97.\r\n\r\nThe internal fire-box C, _fig._ 97., is similar in shape to the\r\nexternal, only it is flat at the top, and close every where except\r\nat the bottom. Between it and the external fire-box an open space\r\nof three inches and a half is left all round, and on the side next\r\nthe boiler this space is increased to four inches. This internal\r\nfire-box is made of copper plates, 7/16 [Pg367] of an inch in\r\nthickness, every where except next the boiler, where the thickness\r\nis 7/8.\r\n\r\nAs the sides and front of the external fire-box, and all the\r\nsurfaces bounding the internal fire-box, are flat, their form is\r\nunfavourable for the resistance of pressure. Adequate means are,\r\ntherefore, provided for strengthening them. The plates forming the\r\ninternal fire-box are bent outwards near the bottom, until they\r\nare brought into contact with those of the external fire-box, to\r\nwhich they are attached by copper rivets, as represented at _f_ in\r\n_fig._ 97. The plates forming the bounding surfaces of the two\r\nfire-boxes are fastened together by stays represented at _k_ in\r\n_figs._ 97. and 102. These stays, which are of copper, have a\r\nscrew cut upon them through their whole length, and holes are made\r\nthrough the plates of both fire-boxes tapped with corresponding\r\nthreads. The copper screws are then passed through them, and\r\nrivets formed on their heads within and without, as seen in _fig._\r\n102. These screw rivets connect all parts of the plating of the\r\ntwo fire-boxes which are opposed to each other: they are placed at\r\nabout four inches apart over the sides and back of the internal\r\nfire-place and that part of the front which is below the boiler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 97.\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL VERTICAL SECTION OF A LOCOMOTIVE ENGINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 98.\r\n\r\nLONGITUDINAL VERTICAL SECTION OF THE TENDER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 99.\r\n\r\nPLAN OF THE WORKING MACHINERY OF A LOCOMOTIVE ENGINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 100.\r\n\r\nPLAN OF THE TENDER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 101.\r\n\r\nELEVATION OF THE HINDER END OF A LOCOMOTIVE ENGINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 102.\r\n\r\nCROSS VERTICAL SECTION OF THE ENGINE THROUGH THE FIRE-BOX.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 103.\r\n\r\nELEVATION OF THE FOREMOST END OF THE ENGINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 104.\r\n\r\nCROSS VERTICAL SECTION OF ENGINE THROUGH THE SMOKE-BOX.]\r\n\r\nAs the top of the internal fire-box cannot be strengthened by\r\nstays of this kind, ribs of wrought-iron, which are seen in their\r\nlength at _l_, in _fig._ 97., and of which an end view is seen in\r\n_fig._ 102., are attached by bolts to it. These ribs are hollowed\r\nout, as seen in _fig._ 97., between bolt and bolt, in order to\r\nbreak their contact with the roof of the fire-box, and allow a\r\nmore free passage to the heat through it. If they were in\r\ncontinuous contact with the fire-box, the metal composing them\r\nwould become more highly heated, and would soon wear out, besides\r\nintercepting heat from the water. This part of the fire-box is\r\nsubject to rapid wear, unless care be taken that the level of the\r\nwater be preserved at its proper height in the boiler. Even when\r\nthe boiler is properly filled, the depth of water above the roof\r\nof the fire-box is not considerable, and on the least neglect the\r\nroof may be exposed to the contact of steam, in which case it will\r\nsoon be destroyed.\r\n\r\nTo prevent accidents arising from this cause, a leaden plug,\r\n[Pg368] represented at _m_, _figs._ 97. and 102., is inserted in\r\nthe roof of the internal fire-box. If the water be allowed to\r\nsubside, this plug will melt out before the copper is very\r\ninjuriously heated, and the steam rushing out at the aperture will\r\ncause the fire to be extinguished.\r\n\r\nCopper fire-boxes are almost universally used; but sometimes, from\r\nthe consideration of cheapness, the internal fire-box is\r\nconstructed of iron.\r\n\r\nIn the plating which forms the back of the external fire-box, an\r\noval aperture is formed, as represented in the back view of the\r\nengine, _fig._ 101., for the fire-door _g_. The plating of the\r\ninternal fire-box around this aperture is bent at right angles to\r\nmeet that of the external fire-box, to which it is fastened by a\r\nrow of copper rivets. The fire-door is formed of two plates of\r\nwrought-iron, riveted together with a space of nine inches and a\r\nhalf between them. The air between these plates being an imperfect\r\nconductor of heat, keeps the outer plate of the fire-door at a\r\nmoderate temperature.\r\n\r\nIn that part of the surface of the internal fire-box which forms\r\nthe end of the boiler, holes are made to receive the extremities\r\nof the tubes, by which the air proceeding from the fire is drawn\r\nto the smoke-box at the remote end of the boiler. These tubes are\r\nrepresented in longitudinal section at E, _fig._ 97., and their\r\nends are seen in the surface of the internal fire-box in _fig._\r\n102., and in the remote end of the boiler where they terminate in\r\nthe smoke-box in _fig._ 104. These tubes are formed of the best\r\nrolled brass, and their thickness in the engine, to which we now\r\nrefer, is 1/13 of an inch. After the brass plating is bent into\r\nthe form of a tube, and being overlapped, is properly soldered\r\ntogether, and the edges smoothed off, the tubes are made perfectly\r\ncylindrical by being drawn through a circular steel die.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 105.]\r\n\r\nThe tube-plates (as those parts of the boiler ends in which the\r\ntubes are inserted are called) are bored with holes in corresponding\r\npositions, truly cylindrical, and corresponding in magnitude to the\r\ntubes, so that the tubes, when passed into them, will be just in\r\ncontact with them. The length of the tubes is so regulated, that\r\nwhen extending from end to end of the boiler, and passing through\r\nthe holes, they shall [Pg369] project at each end a little beyond\r\nthe holes. The manner of fastening them so as to be water-tight is\r\nas follows:—A steel hoop or ferrule, made slightly conical, a\r\nsection of which is exhibited at C. _fig._ 105., the smaller end of\r\nwhich is a little less than the internal diameter of the tube, but\r\nwhich increases towards the outer end, is driven in as represented\r\nin the figure. It acts as a wedge, and forces the tube into close\r\ncontact with the edges of the hole in the tube-plate.\r\n\r\nWhen particular tubes in a boiler are worn out, and require to be\r\nreplaced, their removal is easily effected. It is only necessary\r\nto cut the steel ferrule on the inside, and to bend it off from\r\ncontact with the tube, by which means it can be loosened and\r\nwithdrawn, and the tube removed.\r\n\r\nIn the engine to which this description refers there were one\r\nhundred and twenty-four tubes, the external diameter of which was\r\n1-5/8 inch. The distance between tube and tube was 3/4 of an inch.\r\nThe number of tubes vary in different engines, some having so many\r\nas one hundred and fifty, while the number in some is less than\r\nninety. The evaporating power of an engine greatly depends on the\r\nproper number and magnitude of its tubes; and the experience which\r\nengineers have had on railways have led them gradually to increase\r\nthe number of tubes, and diminish their magnitude. In the Rocket,\r\nalready mentioned as having gained the prize on the opening of the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester Railway, the number of tubes was\r\ntwenty-four, and their diameter three inches; but in all the\r\nengines subsequently made their number was augmented, and their\r\ndiameter diminished. The practical inconvenience which limits the\r\nsize of the tubes is their liability to become choked by cinders\r\nand ashes, which get wedged in them when they are too small, and\r\nthereby obstruct the draft, and diminish the evaporating power of\r\nthe boiler. The tubes now in use, of about an inch and a [Pg370]\r\nhalf internal diameter, not only require to be cleared of the\r\nashes and cinders, which get fastened in them after each journey,\r\nbut it is necessary throughout a journey of any length that the\r\ntubes should be picked and cleaned by opening the fire door at\r\nconvenient intervals.\r\n\r\nThe substitution of brass for copper tubes, which has been already\r\nmentioned as so great an improvement in the construction of\r\nlocomotive engines, is ascribed to Mr. Dixon, who suggested them\r\nin 1833, being then the resident engineer of the Liverpool and\r\nManchester Railway. They are said to last six or eight times as\r\nlong as copper tubes of the same dimensions.\r\n\r\nWhen tubes fail, they are usually destroyed by the pressure of the\r\nwater crushing them inwards: the water enters through the rent made\r\nin the tube, and flowing upon the fire extinguishes it. When a\r\nsingle tube thus fails upon a journey, the engine, notwithstanding\r\nthe accident, may generally be made to work to the end of its\r\njourney by plugging the ends of the broken tube with hard wood; the\r\nwater in contact with which will prevent the fire from burning it\r\naway.\r\n\r\nTubes of the dimensions here referred to weigh about sixteen\r\npounds, and lose from six to seven pounds before they are worn\r\nout. Their cost is about one pound each.\r\n\r\nThe tubes act as stays, connecting the ends of the boiler to\r\nstrengthen them. Besides these, there are rods of wrought iron\r\nextended from end to end of the boiler above the roof of the\r\ninternal fire-place. These rods are represented at _o_ in their\r\nlength in _fig._ 97., and an end view of them is seen in _fig._\r\n102. The smoke-box F, _fig._ 97. 104., containing the cylinders,\r\nsteam-pipe, and blast-pipe, is four feet wide, and two feet long.\r\nIt is formed of wrought iron plates, half an inch thick on the\r\nside next the boiler, and a quarter of an inch elsewhere. The\r\nplates are riveted in the same manner as those of the fire-box\r\nalready described. From the top of the smoke-box, which, like the\r\nfire-box, is semi-cylindrical, as seen in elevation in _fig._\r\n103., and in section _fig._ 104., rises the chimney G, fifteen\r\ninches diameter, and formed of 1/8 inch iron plates, riveted and\r\nbound round by hoops. It is flanged to the top of the [Pg371]\r\nsmoke-box, as represented in _fig._ 104. Near the bottom of the\r\nsmoke-box the working cylinders are placed, side by side, in a\r\nhorizontal position, with the slide valves upwards. In the top of\r\nthe external fire-box a circular aperture is formed fifteen inches\r\nin diameter, and upon this aperture is placed the steam-dome T\r\n(_figs._ 97. 101, 102.) two feet high, and attached around the\r\ncircular aperture by a flange and screw secured by nuts. This\r\nsteam dome is made of brass 3/8 inch thick. In stationary boilers,\r\nwhere magnitude is not limited, it has been already explained,\r\nthat the space allowed for steam is sufficiently large to secure\r\nthe complete separation of the vapour from the spray which is\r\nmixed with it when it issues immediately from the water. In\r\nlocomotive boilers sufficient space cannot be allowed for this,\r\nand the separation of the water from the steam is effected by the\r\narrangement here represented. A funnel-shaped tube _d′_ (_figs._\r\n97. 102.), with its wide end upwards, rises into the steam-dome,\r\nand reaches nearly to the top of it. This funnel bends towards the\r\nback of the fire-box, and is attached by a flange and screws to\r\nthe great steam-pipe S, which traverses the whole length of the\r\nboiler. The steam rising from the boiler fills the steam-dome T,\r\nand descends in the funnel-shaped tube _d′_. The space it has thus\r\nto traverse enables the steam to disengage itself almost\r\ncompletely from the priming. The wider part of the great\r\nsteam-pipe _a_ is flanged and screwed at the hinder end to a\r\ncorresponding aperture in the back plate of the fire-box. This\r\nopening is covered by a circular plate, secured by screws, having\r\na stuffing-box in its centre, of the same kind as is used for the\r\npiston-rods of steam-cylinders. Through this stuffing-box the\r\nspindle _a″_ of the regulator passes, and to its end is attached a\r\nwinch _h′_, by which the spindle _a″_ is capable of being turned.\r\nThis winch is limited in its play to a quarter of a revolution.\r\nThe other end of the spindle _a″_ is attached to a plate _e′_ seen\r\nedgeways in _fig._ 97., and the face of which is seen in _fig._\r\n102.: this circular plate _e_ is perforated with two apertures\r\nsomewhat less than quadrants. That part of the plate, therefore,\r\nwhich remains not pierced forms two solid pieces somewhat greater\r\nthan quadrants. This plate is ground so as to move in steam-tight\r\n[Pg372] contact with a fixed plate under it, which terminates at\r\nthe wide end of the conical mouth of the steam-pipe S. This fixed\r\ncircular plate is likewise pierced with two nearly quadrantal\r\napertures, corresponding with those in the movable plate _e′_.\r\nWhen the movable plate _e′_ is turned round by the winch _h′_, the\r\napertures in it may be made to correspond with those of the fixed\r\ncircular plate on which it moves, in which position the steam-pipe\r\nS communicates with the funnel _d′_ by the two quadrantal\r\napertures thus open. If, on the other hand, the winch _h′_ be\r\nmoved from this position through a quarter revolution, then the\r\nquadrantal openings in the movable plate will be brought over the\r\nsolid parts of the fixed plate on which it moves, and these solid\r\nparts being a little more than quadrants, while the openings are a\r\nlittle less, all communication between the steam-pipe S and the\r\nfunnel _d′_ will be stopped, for in this case the quadrantal\r\nopenings in the fixed and movable plates respectively will be\r\nstopped by the solid parts of these plates. It will be evident\r\nthat as the winch _h′_ of the regulator is moved from the former\r\nposition to the latter, in every intermediate position the\r\naperture communicating between the funnel _d′_ and the steam-pipe\r\nS will be less in magnitude than the complete quadrant. It will in\r\nfact be composed of two openings having the form of _sectors_ of a\r\ncircle less than a quadrant, and these sectors may be made of any\r\nmagnitude, however small, until the opening is altogether closed.\r\n\r\nBy such means the admission of steam from the boiler to the\r\nsteam-pipe S may be regulated by the winch _h′_.\r\n\r\nThe steam being admitted to the steam-pipe passes through it to\r\nthe front end of the boiler, and the pipe being enclosed within\r\nthe boiler the temperature of the steam is maintained. The\r\nsteam-pipe passing through the tube-plate at the front end of the\r\nboiler is carried to a small distance from the tube-plate in the\r\nsame direction, where it is flanged on to a cross horizontal pipe\r\nproceeding to the right and to the left as represented in _fig._\r\n104. This cross pipe is itself flanged to two curved steam-pipes S\r\n(_fig._ 104.), by which the steam is conducted to the valve-boxes\r\nV V. The lower ends of these curved arms are flanged on to the\r\nvalve-boxes of the two cylinders [Pg373] at the ends nearest to\r\nthe boiler. The opening of one of these is exhibited in the right\r\nhand cylinder in _fig._ 99. By these pipes the steam is conducted\r\ninto the valve-boxes or steam-chests, from which it is admitted by\r\nslide-valves to the cylinders to work the pistons in the same\r\nmanner as has been already described in the large stationary\r\nengines.\r\n\r\nOn the upper sides of the cylinders are formed the steam-chests or\r\nvalve-boxes, which are exhibited at U (_figs._ 97. 99. 104.).\r\nThese are made of cast-iron half an inch thick, and are bolted to\r\nthe upper side of each cylinder. At the front end they are also\r\nsecured by bolts to the smoke-box, and at the hinder end are\r\nattached to the tube-plate. These valve-boxes communicate with the\r\npassages _m_ and _n_ _fig._ 99. leading to the top and bottom of\r\nthe cylinder: these are called the steam-ports. They also\r\ncommunicate with a passage _o_ leading to the mouth of a curved\r\nhorizontal pipe _p′_ connecting the front ends of the two\r\ncylinders, as seen in _figs._ 99. 104. These curved pipes unite in\r\na single vertical pipe _p_, called the _blast-pipe_, seen in\r\n_figs._ 97. 104.: this vertical pipe becomes gradually small\r\ntowards the top, and terminates a little above the base of the\r\nfunnel or chimney G. In the valve-box is placed the slide-valve\r\n_v_ to which is attached the spindle _l′_. This spindle moves\r\nthrough a stuffing-box _k′_, and is worked by gearing, which will\r\nbe described hereafter. According to the position given to the\r\nslide, a communication may be opened between the steam-chest, or\r\nthe waste-port, and either end of the cylinders. Thus when the\r\nslide is in the position represented in _fig._ 97. the steam-chest\r\ncommunicates with the front end of the cylinder, while the\r\nwaste-port communicates with the hinder end. If, on the other\r\nhand, the spindle _l′_ being pressed forward, move the slide to\r\nits extreme opposite position, the steam-port _n_ would\r\ncommunicate with the waste-port _o_, while the steam-chest would\r\ncommunicate with the steam-port _m_, steam would, therefore, be\r\nadmitted to the hinder end of the cylinder, while the foremost end\r\nwould communicate with the waste-port. It will be perceived that\r\nthis arrangement is precisely similar to that of the slide-valves\r\nalready described (133.). The slide-valve is represented on a\r\nlarger scale in _fig._ 106., where A is the hinder steam-port,\r\n[Pg374] B the foremost steam-port, and C the waste-port. The\r\nsurfaces D, separating the steam-ports from the waste-ports, are\r\ncalled the bars: they are planed perfectly smooth, so that the\r\nsurfaces F and G of the slide-valve, also planed perfectly smooth,\r\nmay move in steam-tight contact with them. These surfaces are kept\r\nin contact by the pressure of the steam in the steam-chest, by\r\nwhich the slide-valve is always pressed down. In its middle\r\nposition, as represented by the dotted lines in the figure, both\r\nthe steam-ports are stopped by the slide-valve, so that at that\r\nmoment no steam is admitted to either end of the cylinder. On\r\neither side of this intermediate position the slide has an inch\r\nand a half play, which is sufficient to open successively the two\r\nsteam-ports.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 106.]\r\n\r\nThe cylinders are inserted at one end in the plate of the\r\nsmoke-box, and at the other in the tube-plate of the boiler. They\r\nare closed at either end by cast iron covers, nearly an inch\r\nthick, flanged on by bolts and screws. In the cover of the\r\ncylinder attached to the tube-plate is a stuffing-box, in which\r\nthe piston rod plays. The metallic pistons used in locomotive\r\nengines do not differ materially from those already described, and\r\ntherefore need not be here particularly noticed. From their\r\nhorizontal position they have a tendency to wear unequally in the\r\ncylinders, their weight pressing them on one side only; but from\r\ntheir small magnitude this effect is found to be imperceptible in\r\npractice. In the engine here described the stroke of the piston is\r\neighteen inches, and this is the most usual length of stroke in\r\nlocomotive engines. The piston, in its play, comes at either end\r\nwithin about half an inch of the inner surface of the covers of\r\nthe cylinders, this space being allowed to prevent collision. In\r\nthe foremost cover of the cylinder is inserted a cock _q′_ (_fig._\r\n97. 99.), by which any water which may collect in the cylinder by\r\ncondensation or priming may be discharged. A cock _r′_ (_fig._\r\n97.), communicating with a small tube proceeding from the branches\r\nof the waste pipe _p′_ (_fig._ 104.), is likewise provided to\r\ndischarge from that pipe any water which may be [Pg375] collected\r\nin it. After the steam has been admitted to work the piston\r\nthrough the slide-valve, and has been discharged through the\r\nwaste-port by shifting that valve, it passes through the pipe _p′_\r\ninto the blast-pipe _p_, from the mouth of which it issues, with\r\ngreat force, up the funnel G. When the motion of the engine is\r\nrapid, the steam from the two cylinders proceeds in an almost\r\nuninterrupted current from the blast-pipe, and causes a strong\r\ndraft up the chimney. The heated air which passes from the mouths\r\nof the tubes into the smoke-box is drawn up by this current, and a\r\ncorresponding draft is produced in the fire-box.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 107.]\r\n\r\nThe piston-rods Y terminate in a fork, by which they are attached\r\nto cross heads Z, the ends of which are confined by guide-bars A′,\r\nin which they are allowed to play backwards and forwards through a\r\nspace equal to the stroke of the piston. To these cross heads Z,\r\nbetween the prongs of the fork in which the piston terminates, are\r\nattached the foremost ends of the connecting rods B′. These rods\r\nare, therefore, driven backwards and forwards by the motion\r\nimparted to the cross head Z by the piston-rods Y. The connecting\r\nrods B′ are attached at the hinder ends to two cranks formed upon\r\nthe axles C′ of the driving wheels D′. These two cranks are formed\r\nupon the axles precisely at right angles to each other. The\r\nleft-hand crank is represented in its horizontal position, in\r\n_fig._ 99., and the right-hand crank is seen in its vertical\r\nposition. A cranked axle is represented on a larger scale in\r\n_fig._ 107., and the two cranks are seen in a position oblique to\r\nthe plane of the figure. As this axle is the instrument by which\r\nthe impelling force is conveyed to the load, and as it has to\r\nsupport a great portion of the weight of the engine, it is\r\nconstructed with great strength and precision. It is made all in\r\none [Pg376] piece, and of the best wrought iron called Back\r\nBarrow, or scrap iron. In the engine here described its extreme\r\nlength is six feet and a half, and its diameter is five inches. At\r\nthe centre part A it is cylindrical, and is increased to five\r\ninches and a quarter at C, where the cranks are formed. The sides\r\nD of the cranks are four inches thick, and the crank pins B, which\r\nare truly cylindrical, are five inches diameter, and three inches\r\nin length, the brasses at the extremities of the connecting rods\r\nwhich play upon them having a corresponding magnitude. The\r\ndistance from the centre of the crank-pins B to the centre of the\r\naxle A must be exactly equal to half the stroke of the piston, and\r\nis, therefore, in this case precisely nine inches. Upon the parts\r\nF, which are seven inches and a half long, the great driving\r\nwheels are firmly fastened, so as to be prevented from turning or\r\nshaking upon the axle. The axle projects beyond the wheels at G,\r\nwhere it is reduced to three inches and an eighth diameter. These\r\nprojecting parts G are five inches long, having collars at the\r\nouter ends. Brasses are fixed at the outside frame of the engine\r\nwhich rest upon these projections G of the axle, and upon these\r\nbrasses the weight of the engine is supported. The entire axle is\r\naccurately turned in a lathe, and each of the crank-pins B is\r\nlikewise turned by suspending the axle on centres corresponding\r\nwith the centres of the crank-pins, and made on strong cast iron\r\narms, which are firmly fixed on the ends of the axle, and project\r\nbeyond the cranks so as to balance the axle, and enable it to turn\r\nround on the centre of the crank-pin. The axle is by such means\r\nmade perfectly true, and the cranks are made of exactly the proper\r\nlength, and precisely at right angles to each other. The corners\r\nof the cranks are champered off, as shown in the figure, and the\r\nends of the cylindrical parts well rounded out.\r\n\r\nThe strength and accuracy of construction indispensable in these\r\ncranked axles, in order to make them execute their work, render\r\nthem very expensive. Those which are here described cost about\r\n50_l._ each. When properly constructed, however, they are seldom\r\nbroken, but are sometimes bent when the engine escapes from the\r\nrails.\r\n\r\nThe proper motion to admit and withdraw the steam from [Pg377]\r\neither end of the cylinder is imparted to the slide-valves by\r\neccentrics, in a manner and on a principle so similar to that\r\nalready described in large stationary engines, that it will not be\r\nnecessary here to enter into any detailed explanation of the\r\napparatus for communicating this motion, which is exhibited in\r\nplan and section in _figs._ 97. 99. The eccentrics are attached to\r\nthe cranked axles at E′ E″. The eccentric E′ imparts motion by a\r\nrod _e″_ to a lever _h″_, formed on an axle extending across the\r\nframe of the engine. This conveys motion to another lever _l″_,\r\nprojecting from the same axle. This lever _l″_ is jointed to\r\nhorizontal links _m″_, which at the foremost ends are attached to\r\nthe spindle _l′_, by which the slide is driven. By these means the\r\nmotion received by the eccentric from the great working axle\r\nconveys to the spindle _l′_ an alternate movement backwards and\r\nforwards, and the points at which it is reversed will be regulated\r\nby the position given to the eccentric upon the great axle. The\r\neccentric is formed in two separate semicircles, and is keyed on\r\nto the great axle, and consequently any position may be given to\r\nit which may be required. The position to be given to the\r\neccentrics should be such that they shall be at right angles to\r\ntheir respective cranks, and they should be fixed a quarter of a\r\nrevolution behind the cranks so as to move the slides to that\r\nextent in advance of the pistons, since by the position of the\r\nlevers _h″_ and _l″_, the motion of the eccentric becomes reversed\r\nbefore it reaches the valve spindle.\r\n\r\nThe performance of the engine is materially affected by the\r\nposition of the eccentrics on the working axle. The slide should\r\nbegin to uncover the steam-port a little before the commencement\r\nof the stroke of the piston, in order that the steam impelling the\r\npiston should be shut off, and the steam about to impel it in the\r\ncontrary direction admitted before the termination of the stroke.\r\nThrough this small space the steam, therefore, must act in\r\nopposition to the motion of the piston. This is called the _lead_\r\nof the slide, and the extent generally given to it is about a\r\nquarter of an inch. This is accomplished by fixing the eccentrics\r\nnot precisely at right angles to the respective cranks, but a\r\nlittle in advance of that position. The introduction of the steam\r\nto [Pg378] the piston before the termination of the stroke has\r\nthe effect of bringing it gradually to rest at the end of the\r\nstroke, and thereby diminishing the jerk or shock produced by the\r\nrapid change of motion. In stationary engines, where the\r\nreciprocations of the engine are slow, the necessity for this\r\nprovision does not arise; but in locomotive engines in which the\r\nmotion of the piston is changed from four to six times in a\r\nsecond, it becomes necessary. The steam admitted to the piston\r\nbefore the termination of the stroke acts as a spring-cushion to\r\nassist in changing its motion, and if it were not applied, the\r\npiston could not be kept tight upon the piston-rod. Another\r\nadvantage which is produced by allowing some lead to the slide is\r\nthat the waste steam which has just impelled the piston begins to\r\nmake its escape through the waste-port before the commencement of\r\nthe next stroke, so that when the impelling steam begins to\r\nproduce the returning stroke, there is less waste steam on the\r\nother side of the piston to resist it.\r\n\r\nWhen the motion of the engine is very rapid, the resistance of the\r\nwaste steam, as it escapes from the blast-pipe to the piston, has\r\nbeen generally supposed to be very considerable, though we are not\r\naware of any direct experiments by which its amount has been\r\nascertained. In the account of the locomotive engine which has\r\nbeen here described, supplied by Mr. Stephenson for the last\r\nedition of Tredgold on the Steam Engine, he states, that the\r\naverage resisting pressure of the waste steam throughout the\r\nstroke is 6 lbs. per square inch, when running at the usual rate\r\nof from 25 to 28 miles an hour, and that at greater velocities\r\nthis negative pressure has been found to increase to more than\r\ndouble that amount. No experiments are, however, cited from which\r\nthis inference has been drawn.\r\n\r\nIt has been also thought that the pressure of steam upon the\r\npiston in the cylinder, at high velocities, is considerably below\r\nthe pressure of steam in the boiler; but this has not been, so far\r\nas we are informed, ascertained by any satisfactory experimental\r\ntest. Mr. Stephenson likewise states, that this loss of pressure,\r\ncauses the negative pressure or resistance of the waste steam to\r\namount to [Pg379] from 30 to 40 per cent. of the positive\r\npressure upon the piston when the engine is running very fast, and\r\nthat therefore the power of the engine is diminished nearly one\r\nhalf.\r\n\r\nBut it will be perceived that besides the uncertainty which\r\nattends the estimate of the actual amount of pressure on the\r\npiston compared with the pressure of steam in the boiler, the\r\ninference here drawn does not appear to be compatible with what\r\nhas been already proved respecting the mechanical effect of steam.\r\nNo change of pressure which may take place between the boiler and\r\nthe cylinder can affect the practical efficacy of the steam. As\r\nthe steam passes through the engine, whatever change of pressure\r\nit may be subject to, it still remains common steam; and though\r\nits pressure may be diminished, its volume being increased in a\r\nnearly equal proportion, its mechanical effect will remain the\r\nsame. The power of the engine, therefore, estimated as it ought to\r\nbe, by the whole mechanical effect produced, will not be altered\r\notherwise than by the effect of the increased resistance produced\r\nby the blast-pipe. What that resistance is, we repeat, has not, so\r\nfar as we know, been ascertained by direct experiment, and there\r\nare circumstances attending it which render it probable that, even\r\nat high velocities, it is less in amount than Mr. Stephenson's\r\nestimate.\r\n\r\nThe position of the eccentrics which is necessary to make the\r\npistons drive the engine forward must be directly the reverse of\r\nthat which would cause them to drive the engine backwards. To be\r\nable, therefore, to reverse the motion of the engine, it would\r\nonly be necessary to be able to reverse the position of the\r\neccentrics, which may be accomplished by either of two expedients.\r\n\r\n_First_, The eccentrics may be capable of revolving on the great\r\nworking axle, and also of sliding upon it through a small space.\r\nTheir revolution on the axle may be checked by letting a pin\r\nattached to a collar fastened on the axle fall into a hole on the\r\nside of the eccentric. Such a pin will drive the eccentric round\r\nwith the axle, and the position of this pin and the hole will\r\ndetermine the position of the eccentric with reference to the\r\ncrank. At a short distance [Pg380] on the other side of the\r\neccentric may be a corresponding collar with a pin in the opposite\r\nposition. By moving the eccentric longitudinally on the axle, the\r\nformer pin may be withdrawn from the hole, and the latter allowed\r\nto fall into the hole on the other side. Proper mechanism may be\r\nprovided by which the position of the eccentric may thus be\r\nreversed in reference to the crank, and by such means the motion\r\nof the engine may be reversed.\r\n\r\n_Secondly_, Supposing the eccentrics which drive the engine\r\nforward to be immovably fixed upon the axle, two other eccentrics\r\nmay be provided attached to other parts of the same axle, and\r\nhaving a position exactly the reverse with reference to the\r\ncranks. Proper mechanism may be provided, by which either or both\r\npairs of eccentrics may be thrown in or out of gear. Such are the\r\nmeans adopted in the engine which has been already described. The\r\neccentrics for driving the engine backwards are placed outside the\r\ncranks at F′ F″. A hand lever _w″_ _fig._ 101. is provided, by\r\nwhich the engine man may throw either pair of eccentrics into or\r\nout of gear, so as to make the engine work either backwards or\r\nforwards.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 108.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 109.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 110.]\r\n\r\nAs all the moving parts of the engine require to be constantly\r\nlubricated with oil to diminish the friction, and keep them cool,\r\noil-cups for this purpose are fixed upon them. In some engines\r\nthese oil-cups are attached separately to all the moving parts: in\r\nothers they are placed near each other in a row on the boiler, and\r\ncommunicate by small tubes with the several parts required to be\r\nlubricated. One of these is requisite for each end of the\r\nconnecting rods, for each of the guides of the piston-rods, for\r\nthe piston-rod itself, the spindle of the slide-valve, and other\r\nparts. An elevation of one of these oil-cups is shown in _fig._\r\n108., a vertical section in _fig._ 109., and horizontal plan in\r\n_fig._ 110. The cup A is made of brass with a cover B. This cover\r\nhas a piece projecting from it turning upon a pin in a socket C at\r\nthe side of the cup A, and square at the end, resting upon a small\r\nspring at the bottom of the socket to hold it either open or shut.\r\nIn the bottom of the [Pg381] cup is inserted an iron tube D\r\nextending nearly to the top. This tube projects from the bottom of\r\nthe cup, where it is tapped for the purpose of fixing the cup on\r\nthe part of the engine which it is intended to lubricate. The hole\r\ninto which the cup is screwed communicates with the rubbing\r\nsurface, and some cotton thread is passed through the tube dipping\r\ninto the oil in the cup at the one end and touching the moving\r\npart at the other. This thread acts as a siphon, and constantly\r\ndrops oil on the rubbing surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 111.]\r\n\r\nThe tender is a carriage attached behind the engine and close to it,\r\ncarrying coke for the supply of the furnace, and water for the\r\nboiler. The coke is contained in the space R″, (_fig._ 98. 100.)\r\nsurrounded by a tank I″ containing water to feed the boiler. The\r\nfeed for the boiler is conducted from the tank through a pipe\r\ndescending downwards and in a curved direction, P″ Q″, _fig._ 98.,\r\nand connected with a horizontal pipe K, _fig._ 97. A cock is\r\nprovided at P″, by which the supply of water to this pipe may be cut\r\noff at pleasure. Another cock is provided at _t′_, _fig._ 97., where\r\nthe curved pipe joins the horizontal pipe by which the quantity of\r\nwater supplied to K may be regulated by opening the cock more or\r\nless fully. The handle of this cock rises through the floor of the\r\nengine, so that the engineer may regulate it at discretion. The pipe\r\nK being conducted under the engine, as represented in _fig._ 97.,\r\nterminates in a vertical pipe, of greater diameter, containing two\r\nvalves, both of which open upwards, and between these valves to this\r\nvertical pipe is attached a force-pump, by which the water is drawn\r\nfrom the horizontal pipe K into the vertical pipe K′, and from the\r\nlatter is driven into a delivery-pipe by which it is forced into the\r\nboiler. The details of the interior of this feed-pump are\r\nrepresented on a larger scale in _fig._ 111. The extremity of the\r\nhorizontal pipe K′ is represented in section at H, where it is\r\njoined on by a screw to the bottom of the vertical pipe which is\r\nrepresented in _fig._ 97. at K, and which is here represented in\r\nsection. The vertical pipe, represented in _fig._ 97. consists of\r\nseveral parts screwed together by nuts and bolts passing through\r\nflanges. The lowest piece I is attached by a flange to the piece L:\r\nwithin these is contained the valve Q resting in a seat made\r\nconical, so that the ball [Pg382] which forms the valve shall rest\r\nin water-tight contact with it. The ball is turned and ground to an\r\naccurate sphere, and whatever position it assumes upon its seat its\r\ncontact will be perfect. It is guided in its upward and downward\r\nmotion by several vertical bars which confine it, and which are\r\nunited at the top, so as to limit the upward motion of the ball. A\r\nscrew V′ is inserted in the bottom of the piece I, by removing which\r\naccess can be obtained to the valve. The piece L is secured to the\r\nshort pipe G by nuts and bolts passed through a flange. The pipe G\r\nis cast upon the end of the feed-pump A. On the foremost end of this\r\nfeed-pump is constructed a stuffing-box C of the usual form, having\r\na gland D forced against packing by nuts and screws E. The plunger B\r\nis turned so as to be truly cylindrical, and moves in water-tight\r\ncontact through the gland D. The plunger not being in contact with\r\nthe inner surface of the pump-barrel A, the latter need not be\r\nground. The horizontal rod by which the plunger B is driven is\r\nattached at its foremost extremity to an arm which projects from the\r\nrod of the steam-piston, and consequently this plunger is moved\r\nthrough a space equal to the stroke of the steam-piston. In this\r\ncase that space is eighteen inches. The [Pg383] upper end of the\r\nvertical tube G is attached by screws and a flange to a piece P\r\ncontaining a valve R similar in all respects to the lower valve Q,\r\nand like it opening upwards. A screw V is introduced at the top by\r\nwhich access may be obtained to this valve. This screw also presses\r\non the crown of the guides of the valve, so as to hold it down by\r\nregulated pressure. At the side of this upper piece P is inserted a\r\nhorizontal tube M connected with the end of the delivery-pipe N.\r\nThis latter is continued to the boiler with which it communicates at\r\nthe fire-box. When the plunger B is drawn out of the pump-barrel A,\r\nthe spherical valve Q being relieved from its downward pressure is\r\nraised, and water passes from the pipe H through the valve Q into\r\nthe vertical pipe G; the lower valve Q then closes and stops the\r\nreturn of the water. The plunger B returning into the pump-barrel A\r\nthen forces the water against the upper valve R and drives it\r\nthrough the delivery-tube N, from which its return is prevented by\r\nthe valve R. When the delivery-tube N is filled with water\r\nthroughout its whole length, every stroke of the plunger will\r\nevidently drive into the boiler a volume of water equal to the\r\nmagnitude of a part of the plunger eighteen inches in length.\r\n\r\nUntil within the last few years, locomotive engines were supported\r\non only four wheels; they are, however, now almost universally\r\nsupported on six, the driving wheels being in the middle. To give\r\ngreater security to the position of the engine between the rails\r\nit is usual to construct flanges on the tires of all the six\r\nwheels. Mr. Stephenson, however, has been in the practice of\r\nconstructing the driving wheels without flanges, and with tires\r\ntruly cylindrical, depending on the flanges of the two pairs of\r\nsmaller wheels to maintain the engine between the rails. The\r\nwheels of the engine here described are constructed in this\r\nmanner. The driving wheels D′ are fixed on the cranked axle C′,\r\nand are five feet in diameter. The other wheels L′ M′, the one\r\nbeing placed immediately behind the smoke-box, and the other\r\nimmediately behind the fire-box, are each three feet six inches in\r\ndiameter, and have a flange upon their tires, which running on\r\nthe [Pg384] inside of each rail keeps the engine between the\r\nrails. Each pair of these small wheels, like the driving-wheels,\r\nis fixed upon their axle. The axles are 3-5/8 inches diameter, and\r\nproject beyond the wheels, the projecting part supporting the\r\nframe of the engine and turning in brasses. Upon these brasses\r\nrest springs, which bear the whole weight of the engine. These\r\nsprings having nothing between them and the road but the wheels\r\nand axles intercept and equalise the sudden shocks produced by the\r\nrapid motion upon the road.\r\n\r\nWhen an engine is required for the transport of very heavy loads,\r\nsuch as those of merchandise, the adhesion of one pair of working\r\nwheels is found to be insufficient, and, in such cases, one of the\r\ntwo pairs of wheels L′ M′ is made of the same diameter as the\r\nwheels which are placed upon the working axle, and a bar is\r\nattached to points on the outside of the wheels at equal distances\r\nfrom their centre, connecting them in such a manner that any force\r\napplied to make one pair of wheels revolve must necessarily impart\r\nthe same motion to the other pair. By such means the force of the\r\nsteam is made to drive both pairs of wheels, and consequently a\r\nproportionally increased adhesion is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe velocity which an engine is capable of imparting to the load\r\nwhich it draws depends upon the rate at which the pistons are\r\ncapable of being moved in the cylinders. By every motion of each\r\npiston backwards and forwards one revolution of the driving wheels\r\nis produced, and by each revolution of the driving wheels,\r\nsupposing them not to slip upon the rails, the load is driven\r\nthrough a distance upon the road equal to their circumference. As\r\nthe two cylinders work together, it follows, that a quantity of\r\nsteam sufficient to fill four cylinders supplied by the boiler to\r\nthe engine will move the train through a distance equal to the\r\ncircumference of the driving wheels; and in accomplishing this,\r\neach piston must move twice from end to end of the cylinder; each\r\ncylinder must be twice filled with steam from the boiler; and that\r\nsteam must be twice discharged from the cylinder through the\r\nblast-pipe into the chimney.\r\n\r\n[Pg401] If the driving wheels be five feet in diameter their\r\ncircumference will be fifteen feet seven inches. To drive a train\r\nwith a velocity of thirty miles an hour, it will be necessary that\r\nthe engine should be propelled through a space of forty-five feet\r\nper second. To accomplish this with five-feet wheels they must be\r\ntherefore made to revolve at the rate of very nearly three\r\nrevolutions per second; and as each revolution requires two\r\nmotions of the piston in the cylinder, it follows that each piston\r\nmust move three times forwards and three times backwards in the\r\ncylinder in a second; that steam must be admitted six times per\r\nsecond from the steam-chest to each cylinder, and discharged six\r\ntimes per second from each cylinder into the blast-pipe. The\r\nmotion, therefore, of each piston, supposing it to be uniform,\r\nmust divide a second into six equal parts, and the puffs of the\r\nblast-pipe in the chimney must divide a second into twelve equal\r\nparts. The motion of the slides and other reciprocating parts of\r\nthe machinery must consequently correspond.\r\n\r\nThis motion of the reciprocating parts of the machinery being\r\nfound to be injurious to it, and to produce very rapid wear,\r\nattempts have been made to remedy the defect, and to obtain\r\ngreater speed with an equal or diminished rate of motion of the\r\npiston, by the adoption of driving wheels of greater diameter, and\r\non several of the great lines of railway the magnitude of the\r\nwheels for the passenger-engines have been increased to five feet\r\nand a half and six feet diameter; but such engines have not been\r\nsufficiently long in use to afford grounds for forming a practical\r\nestimate of their effects. Experiments of a much bolder\r\ndescription have, however, been tried on one of the great lines of\r\nrailway by the adoption of driving wheels of much greater\r\ndiameter. In some cases their magnitude has been increased even to\r\nten feet; but from various experiments to which these engines have\r\nbeen submitted by myself and others, as well as from the\r\nexperience which appears to be obtained from the results of their\r\nordinary work, it does not appear that any advantages have\r\nattended them, and they have been accordingly for the most part\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of steam in the boiler is limited by two\r\nsafety-valves, [Pg402] represented in _fig._ 97. at N and O. The\r\nvalve at N is under the control of the engineer, but the valve at\r\nO is inaccessible to him. The structure of the safety-vale\r\nrepresented at N is exhibited on a larger scale in _fig._ 112.,\r\nwhich represents its section, and _fig._ 113., which shows a plan\r\nof the valve-seat with the valve removed. The valve A, which is\r\nmade of brass, is mitred round the edge at an angle of 45°, and\r\nhas a spindle, or stalk B, cast upon it, projecting downwards from\r\nthe middle of it. The valve-seat C is also made of brass, and cast\r\nwith a flange at the bottom to attach it to the boiler. The mitred\r\nsurface of the valve is ground into the valve-seat, so as to rest\r\nin steam-tight contact with it. Across the valve-seat, which is\r\ntwo and a half inches in diameter, is cast a thin piece D, seen in\r\nplan in _fig._ 113. and in section in _fig._ 112. which extends\r\nfrom the top to the bottom, and has a longitudinal hole through\r\nit, in which the spindle B of the valve works: by this hole it is\r\nguided when it rises from its seat. A projection E is cast upon\r\nthe seat of the valve, in which a standard F is inserted. This\r\nstandard is forked at the top, and receives the end of a lever G,\r\nwhich turns in it upon a centre. A rod H is jointed to this lever\r\nby another pin at three inches from the former, and the lower end\r\nof this rod, ground to a point, presses upon the centre of the\r\nvalve A. At the other end of the lever, which is broken off in\r\n_fig._ 112., at a distance of three feet from the centre pin,\r\ninserted in the fork of the pillar F, the rod of a common\r\nspring-balance _w_, _fig._ 101., is attached by a finger-nut _n_.\r\nThe bottom of this spring-balance is secured on to the fire-box.\r\nThis balance is screwed up by the finger-nut on the valve-lever\r\nuntil the required pressure on the lever is produced through the\r\nmedium of the rod H, this pressure being generally fifty pounds\r\nper square inch above the atmosphere. When the pressure of the\r\nsteam in the boiler exceeds this, the valve A is raised from its\r\nseat, and the steam escapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 112.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 113.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the sliding weight by which the pressure\r\n[Pg403] of the safety-valve is sometimes regulated in stationary\r\nengines would not be admissible in a locomotive engine, since the\r\nmotion of the engine would constantly jolt it up and down, and\r\ncause the steam to escape. One of the disadvantages attending the\r\nuse of the spring-valve is that it cannot be opened to let the\r\nsteam escape without increasing its force, so that the steam, when\r\nescaping, must really have a greater pressure than that to which\r\nthe valve has been previously adjusted. The longer the lever is,\r\nthe greater will be this difference of pressure, inasmuch as a\r\ngiven elevation of the pin governing the rod H would cause a\r\nproportionally greater motion in that end of the lever attached to\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\nThe second safety-valve O is enclosed in a case, so that it is\r\ninaccessible, and its purpose is to limit the power of the\r\nengineer to increase the pressure of steam in the boiler. This\r\nvalve is similar in construction to the former, but instead of\r\nbeing held down by a lever, is pressed upon by several small\r\nelliptical springs placed one above another over the valve, and\r\nheld down by a screw which turns in a frame Y, fixed into the\r\nvalve-seat. By this screw the pressure on the valve can be\r\nadjusted to any required degree; and if the open safety-valve be\r\nscrewed down to a greater pressure, the steam will begin to escape\r\nfrom this second valve.\r\n\r\nAlso in the case where the boiler produces surplus steam faster\r\nthan its escape can be effected at the valve N, the pressure will\r\nsometimes be increased until the valve O is opened, and its escape\r\nwill take place from both valves.\r\n\r\nThe whole weight of the engine bears upon those parts of the six\r\naxles R′, _fig._ 99., which project beyond the wheels. Boxes are\r\nformed in which these parts of the axles turn, and through the\r\nmedium of which the weight of the engine rests upon them. Over\r\nthese boxes are constructed oil or grease cups, by means of which\r\nthe axles are constantly lubricated. It is usual to lubricate the\r\naxles of the engine itself with oil: the axles of the tender, and\r\nother coaches and waggons, are lubricated with a mixture of oil\r\nand tallow. In the middle of the box in which the axle turns, and\r\nbetween the two oil-cups, is cast a socket, in which the end of\r\nthe spindle on [Pg404] which the spring presses rests. The\r\nsprings are composed of a number of steel-plates, laid, in the\r\nusual manner, one above the other, increasing in length upwards.\r\nIn the engine here described, the plates forming the springs of\r\nthe driving wheels are thirteen in number, each of which is four\r\ninches in width, and 5/16ths of an inch in thickness. The springs\r\nupon the other wheels are three inches in width. The springs of\r\nthe driving wheels are below the axle, while those of the smaller\r\nwheels are above it.\r\n\r\nBuffers D″ are placed behind the tender, which act upon a spring C\r\n(_fig._ 100.), to break the collision, when the waggons or\r\ncarriages strike upon the tender, and similar buffers are attached\r\nto all passenger-coaches. Some of these buffers are constructed\r\nwith a system of springs similar to C, but more elastic, and\r\ncombined in greater number under the framing of the carriage, so\r\nthat a considerable play is allowed to them. In some cases the\r\nrods of the buffers are made to act upon strong spiral springs\r\ninserted in the sides of the framing of the carriage. This\r\narrangement gives greater play to the buffers; and as every coach\r\nin a train has several buffers, the combined effect of these is\r\nsuch, that a considerable shock given to either end of the train\r\nmay be rendered harmless by being spent upon the elasticity of\r\nthese several systems of springs.\r\n\r\nIn order to give notice of the approach of a train, a\r\nsteam-whistle Z′, _fig._ 97. 101., is placed immediately above the\r\nfire-box at the back of the engine. This is an apparatus composed\r\nof two small hemispheres of brass, separated one from the other by\r\na small space. Steam is made to pass through a hollow space\r\nconstructed in the lower hemisphere, and escapes from a very\r\nnarrow circular opening round the edge of that hemisphere, rushing\r\nup with a force proportionate to its pressure. The edge of the\r\nupper hemisphere presented downwards encounters this steam, and an\r\neffect is produced similar to the action of air in organ pipes. A\r\nshrill whistle is produced, which can be heard at a very\r\nconsiderable distance, and, differing from all ordinary sounds, it\r\nnever fails to give timely notice of the approach of a train.\r\n\r\nThe water tank I″, _fig._ 98. 100., which is constructed on the\r\ntender, is formed of wrought-iron plates 1/8 of an inch thick,\r\n[Pg405] riveted at the corners by angle iron already described.\r\nThis tank is 9 feet long, 6-3/4 feet wide, and 2-1/4 feet deep.\r\nThe top is covered with a board K″, and a raised platform N″ is\r\nconstructed behind, divided into three parts, covered with leads,\r\nwhich open on hinges. The middle lid covers an opening to the tank\r\nby which water is let in: the lids at either side cover boxes in\r\nwhich are contained the tools necessary to be carried with the\r\nengine. The curved pipe P″, _fig._ 98., leading from the bottom of\r\nthe tank to the pipe Q″, is of copper. The pipe Q″, connecting the\r\nlatter with the feed-pipe K′, _fig._ 99., is sometimes formed of\r\nleather or India-rubber cloth, having a spiral spring on the\r\ninside to prevent it from collapsing. It is necessary that this\r\npipe Q″ should have a power of yielding to a sufficient degree to\r\naccommodate itself to the inequalities of motion between the\r\nengine and tender. A metal pipe is sometimes used, supplied with a\r\ndouble ball and socket, and a telescopic joint, having sufficient\r\nplay to allow for the lateral and longitudinal inequalities of\r\nmotion of the engine and tender. The weight of an engine, such as\r\nthat here described, supplied with its proper quantity of water\r\nand fuel, is about 12 tons: the tender, when empty, weighs about\r\n3-1/4 tons; and when filled with water and fuel its weight is 7\r\ntons. The tank contains 700 gallons of water, and the tender is\r\ncapable of carrying about 800 weight of coke. This supply is\r\nsufficient for a trip of from thirty to forty miles with an\r\nordinary load.\r\n\r\n\r\n(198.) It is not usual to express the power of locomotive engines\r\nin the same manner as that of other engines by the term\r\nhorse-power. Indeed, until the actual amount of resistance opposed\r\nto these machines, under the various circumstances in which they\r\nare worked, shall be ascertained with some degree of precision, it\r\nis impossible that their power or efficiency can be estimated with\r\nany tolerable degree of approximation. The quantity of water\r\nevaporated, and passed in steam through the cylinders, supplies a\r\nmajor limit to the power exerted; but even this necessary element\r\nfor the calculation of the efficacy of these machines has not been\r\nascertained by a sufficiently extensive course of observation and\r\nexperiment. Mr. Stephenson states, that the engine which [Pg406]\r\nhas been here described is capable of evaporating 77 cubic feet of\r\nwater per hour, while the early locomotives could only evaporate\r\n16 cubic feet per hour. This evaporation, however, is inferior to\r\nthat which I have ascertained myself to be produced by engines in\r\nregular operation on some of the northern railways. In an\r\nexperiment made in July, 1839, with the Hecla engine, I found that\r\nthe evaporation in a trip of ninety-five miles, from Liverpool to\r\nBirmingham, was at the rate of 93·2 cubic feet per hour, and in\r\nreturning the same distance it was at the rate of 85·7 cubic feet\r\nper hour, giving a mean of 89 cubic feet per hour nearly. The\r\nHecla weighed 12 tons; and its dimensions and proportions\r\ncorresponded very nearly with those of the engine above described.\r\n\r\nIn a course of experiments which I made upon the engines then in\r\nuse on the Grand Junction Railway in the autumn of 1838 I found\r\nthat the ordinary evaporating power of these engines varied from\r\neighty to eighty-five cubic feet per hour.\r\n\r\nEngines of much greater dimensions, and consequently of greater\r\nevaporating power, are used on the Great Western Railway. In the\r\nautumn of 1838 experiments were made upon these engines by Mr.\r\nNicholas Wood and myself, when we found that the most powerful\r\nengine on that line, the North Star, drawing a load of 110-1/2\r\ntons gross, engine and tender inclusive, at 30-1/2 miles an hour,\r\nevaporated 200 cubic feet of water per hour. The same engine\r\ndrawing a load of 194-1/2 tons at 18-1/2 miles an hour evaporated\r\n141 cubic feet per hour, and when drawing 45 tons at 38-1/2 miles\r\nan hour evaporated 198 cubic feet of water per hour.\r\n\r\nIt has been already shown that a cubic foot of water evaporated\r\nper hour produces a gross amount of mechanical force very little\r\nless than two-horse power, and consequently the gross amount of\r\nmechanical power evolved in these cases by the evaporation of the\r\nlocomotive boilers will be very nearly twice as many horse-power\r\nas there are cubic feet of water evaporated per hour. Thus the\r\nevaporation of the Hecla, in the experiments made in July, 1839,\r\ngave a gross power of about one hundred and eighty horses, while\r\nthe evaporation of the North Star gave a power of about four\r\nhundred horses. In stationary engines about half the gross\r\n[Pg407] power evolved in the evaporation is allowed for waste,\r\nfriction, and other sources of resistance not connected with the\r\nload. What quantity should be allowed for this in locomotive\r\nengines is not yet ascertained, and therefore it is impossible to\r\nstate what proportion of the whole evaporation is to be taken as\r\nrepresenting the useful horse-power.\r\n\r\n\r\n(199.) The great uniformity of resistance produced by the traction\r\nof carriages upon a railway is such as to render the application\r\nof steam power to that purpose extremely advantageous. So far as\r\nthis resistance depends on mechanical defects, it is probably\r\nrendered as uniform as is practicable, and in proportion to the\r\nquantity of load carried is reduced to as small an amount as it is\r\nlikely to attain under any practicable circumstances. Until a\r\nrecent period this resistance was ascribed altogether, or nearly\r\nso, to mechanical causes. The inequalities of the road-surface,\r\nthe friction of the axles of the wheels in their bearings, and the\r\nvarious sources of resistance due to the machinery of the engine,\r\nbeing the principal of these resistances, were for the most part\r\nindependent of the speed with which the train was moved; and it\r\nwas accordingly assumed in all calculations respecting the power\r\nof locomotive engines that the resistance would be practically the\r\nsame whatever might be the speed of the train. It had been well\r\nunderstood that so far as the atmosphere might offer resistance to\r\nthe moving power this would be dependent on the speed, and would\r\nincrease in a very high ratio with the speed; but it was\r\nconsidered that the part of the resistance due to this cause\r\nformed a fraction of the whole amount so insignificant that it\r\nmight be fairly disregarded in practice, or considered as a part\r\nof the actual computed resistance taken at an average speed.\r\n\r\nIt has been, until a late period, accordingly assumed that the\r\ntotal amount of resistance to railway trains which the locomotive\r\nengines have had to overcome was about the two hundred and\r\nfiftieth part of the gross weight of the load drawn: some\r\nengineers estimated it at a two hundred and twentieth; others at a\r\ntwo hundred and fiftieth; others at a three hundred and thirtieth\r\npart of the load; and the two hundred and fiftieth part of the\r\ngross load drawn may perhaps be [Pg408] considered as a mean\r\nbetween these much varying estimates. What the experiments were,\r\nif any, on which these rough estimates were based, has never\r\nappeared. Each engineer formed his own valuation of this effect,\r\nbut none produced the experimental grounds of their opinion. It\r\nhas been said that the trains run down the engine, or that the\r\ndrawing chains connecting the engine slacken in descending an\r\ninclination of sixteen feet in a mile, or 1/330. Numerous\r\nexperiments, however, made by myself, as well as the constant\r\nexperience now daily obtained on railways, show that this is a\r\nfallacious opinion, except at velocities so low as are never\r\npractised on railways.\r\n\r\n\r\n(200.) In the autumn of 1838 a course of experiments was commenced\r\nat the suggestion of some of the proprietors of the Great Western\r\nRailway Company, with a view to determine various points connected\r\nwith the structure and the working of railways. A part of these\r\nexperiments were intended to determine the mean amount of the\r\nresisting force opposed to the moving power, and this part was\r\nconducted by me. After having tried various expedients for\r\ndetermining the mean amount of resistance to the moving power, I\r\nfound that no method gave satisfactory results except one founded on\r\nobserving the motion of trains by gravity down steep inclined\r\nplanes. When a train of waggons or coaches is placed upon an\r\ninclined plane so steep that it shall descend by its gravity without\r\nany moving power, its motion, when it proceeds from a state of rest,\r\nwill be gradually accelerated, and if the resistance to that motion\r\nwas, as it has been commonly supposed to be, uniform and independent\r\nof the speed, the descent would be uniformly accelerated: in other\r\nwords, the increase of speed would be proportional to the time of\r\nthe motion. Whatever velocity the train would gain in the first\r\nminute, it would acquire twice that velocity at the end of the\r\nsecond minute, three times that velocity at the end of the third\r\nminute, and so on; and this increase of velocity would continue to\r\nfollow the same law, however extended the plane might be. That such\r\nwould be the law which the descending motion of a train would follow\r\nhad always been supposed, up to the time of the experiments now\r\nreferred to; and it was even maintained by some that [Pg409] such a\r\nlaw was in strict conformity with experiments made upon railways and\r\nduly reported. The first experiments instituted by me at the time\r\njust referred to afforded a complete refutation of this doctrine. It\r\nwas found that the acceleration was not uniform, but that with every\r\nincrease of speed the acceleration was lessened. Thus if a certain\r\nspeed were gained by a train in one second when moving at five miles\r\nan hour, a much less speed was gained in one second when moving ten\r\nmiles an hour, and a comparatively small speed was gained in the\r\nsame time when moving at fifteen miles an hour, and so on. In fact,\r\nthe augmentation of the rate of acceleration appeared to diminish in\r\na very rapid proportion as the speed increased: this suggested to me\r\nthe probability that a sufficiently great increase of speed would\r\ndestroy all acceleration, and that the train would at length move at\r\na uniform velocity. In effect, since the moving power which impels a\r\ntrain down an inclined plane of uniform inclination is that fraction\r\nof the gross weight of the train which acts in the direction of the\r\nplane, this moving power must be necessarily invariable; and as any\r\nacceleration which is produced must arise from the excess of this\r\nmoving power over the resistance opposed to the motion of the train,\r\nfrom whatever causes that resistance may arise, whenever\r\nacceleration ceases, the moving force must necessarily be equal to\r\nthe resistance; and therefore, when a train descends an inclined\r\nplane with a uniform velocity, the gross resistance to the motion of\r\nthe train must be equal to the gross weight of the train resolved in\r\nthe direction of the plane; or, in other words, it must be equal to\r\nthat fraction of the whole weight of the train which is expressed by\r\nthe inclination of the plane. Thus if it be supposed that the plane\r\nfalls at the rate of one foot in one hundred, then the force\r\nimpelling the train downwards will be equal to the hundredth part of\r\nthe weight of the train. So long as the resistance to the motion of\r\nthe train continues to be less than the hundredth part of its\r\nweight, so long will the motion of the train be accelerated; and the\r\nmore the hundredth part of the weight exceeds the resistance, the\r\nmore rapid will the acceleration be; and the less the hundredth part\r\nof the weight [Pg410] exceeds the resistance, the less rapid will\r\nthe acceleration be. If it be true that the amount of resistance\r\nincreases with the increase of speed, then a speed may at length be\r\nattained so great that the amount of resistance to the motion of the\r\ntrain will be equal to the hundredth part of the weight. When that\r\nhappens, the moving power of a hundredth part of the weight of the\r\ntrain being exactly equal to the resistance to the motion, there is\r\nno excess of power to produce acceleration, and therefore the motion\r\nof the train will be uniform.\r\n\r\nFounded on these principles, a vast number of experiments were\r\nmade on planes of different inclinations, and with loads of\r\nvarious magnitudes; and it was found, in general, that when a\r\ntrain descended an inclined plane, the rate of acceleration\r\ngradually diminished, and at length became uniform; that the\r\nuniform speed thus attained depended on the weight, form, and\r\nmagnitude of the train and the inclination of the plane; that the\r\nsame train on different inclined planes attained different uniform\r\nspeeds—on the steeper planes a greater speed being attained. From\r\nsuch experiments it followed, contrary to all that had been\r\npreviously supposed, that the amount of resistance to railway\r\ntrains had a dependence on the speed; that this dependence was of\r\ngreat practical importance, the resistance being subject to very\r\nconsiderable variation at different speeds, and that this source\r\nof resistance arises from the atmosphere which the train\r\nencounters. This was rendered obvious by the different amount of\r\nresistance to the motion of a train of coaches and to that of a\r\ntrain of low waggons of equal weight.\r\n\r\nThe former editions of this work having been published before the\r\ndiscovery which has resulted from these experiments, the average\r\namount of resistance to railway trains, there stated, and the\r\nconclusions deduced therefrom, were in conformity with what was\r\nthen known. It was stated that the resistance to the moving power\r\nwas practically independent of the speed, and on level rails was\r\nat the average rate of about seven pounds and a half per ton. This\r\namount would be equivalent to the gravitation of a load down an\r\ninclined plane falling 1/300, and consequently in ascending such a\r\nplane the moving power would have to encounter twice [Pg411] the\r\nresistance opposed to it on a level. As it was generally assumed\r\nthat a locomotive-engine could not advantageously vary its\r\ntractive power beyond this limit, it was therefore inferred that\r\ngradients (as inclinations are called) ought not to be constructed\r\nof greater steepness than 1/300. It was supposed that in\r\ndescending gradients more steep than this the train would be\r\naccelerated and would require the use of the brake to check its\r\nmotion, while in ascending such planes the engine would be\r\nrequired to exert more than twice the ordinary tractive power\r\nrequired on level rails. As the resistance produced by the air was\r\nnot taken into consideration, no distinction was made between\r\nheavy trains of goods presenting a frontage and magnitude bearing\r\na small proportion to their gross weight and lighter trains of\r\npassenger-coaches presenting great frontage and great magnitude in\r\nproportion to their weight. The result of the experiments above\r\nexplained leads to inferences altogether at variance with those\r\nwhich have been given in former editions of the present work, and\r\nwhich were then universally admitted by railway engineers. The\r\ntendency of the results of these experiments show that low\r\ngradients on railways are not attended with the advantageous\r\neffects which have been hitherto ascribed to them; that, on the\r\ncontrary, the resistance produced by steeper gradients can be\r\ncompensated by slackening the speed, so that the power shall be\r\nrelieved from as much atmospheric resistance by the diminution of\r\nvelocity as is equal to the increased resistance produced by the\r\ngravity of the plane which is ascended. And, on the other hand, in\r\ndescending the plane the speed may be increased until the\r\nresistance produced by the atmosphere is increased to the same\r\namount as that by which the train is relieved of resistance by the\r\ndeclivity down which it moves. Thus, on gradients, the inclination\r\nof which is confined within practical limits, the resistance to\r\nthe moving-power may be preserved uniform, or nearly so, by\r\nvarying the velocity.\r\n\r\n\r\n(201.) The series of experiments which have established these\r\ngeneral conclusions have not yet been sufficiently extended\r\nand varied to supply a correct practical estimate of the limit\r\nwhich it would be most advantageous to impose upon the [Pg412]\r\ngradients of railways; but it is certain that railways may be laid\r\ndown, without practical disadvantage, with gradients considerably\r\nsteeper than those to which it has been hitherto the practice to\r\nrecommend as a limit.\r\n\r\nThe principle of compensation by varied speed being admitted, it\r\nwill follow that the time of transit between terminus and terminus\r\nof a line of railway laid down with gradients, varying from twenty\r\nto thirty feet a mile, will be practically the same as it would be\r\non a line of the same length constructed upon a dead level; and\r\nnot only will the time of transport be equal, but the quantity of\r\nmoving power expended will not be materially different. The\r\ndifference between the circumstances of the transport in the two\r\ncases will be merely that, on the undulating line, a varying\r\nvelocity will be imparted to the train and a varying resistance\r\nopposed to the moving power; while on the level line the train\r\nwould be moved at a uniform speed, and the engine worked against a\r\nuniform resistance. These conclusions have been abundantly\r\nconfirmed by the experiments made in last July with the Hecla\r\nengine above referred to. The line of railway between Liverpool\r\nand Birmingham on which the experiment was made extended over a\r\ndistance of ninety-five miles, and the gradients on which the\r\neffects were observed varied from a level to thirty feet per mile,\r\na great portion of the line being a dead level. The following\r\ntable shows the uniform speed with which the train ascended and\r\ndescended the several gradients, and also the mean of the ascent\r\nand descent in each case, as well as the speed upon the level\r\nparts of the line:—\r\n\r\n  ——————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n           |             Speed.            |\r\n           |———————————————-————————————————————————\r\n  Gradient.|  Ascending.   |  Descending.  |   Mean.\r\n  ——————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n   One in  |Miles per hour.|Miles per hour.|\r\n    177    |     22·25     |    41·32      |   31·78\r\n    265    |     24·87     |    39·13      |   32·00\r\n    330    |     25·26     |    37·07      |   31·16\r\n    400    |     26·87     |    36·75      |   31·81\r\n    532    |     27·35     |    34·30      |   30·82\r\n    590    |     27·37     |    33·16      |   30·21\r\n    650    |     29·03     |    32·58      |   30·80\r\n           |               |               |————————\r\n  Level    |               |               |   30·93\r\n  ——————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n\r\n[Pg413] From this table it is apparent that the gradients do\r\npossess the compensating power with respect to speed already\r\nmentioned. The discrepancies existing among the mean values of the\r\nspeed are only what may be fairly ascribed to casual variations in\r\nthe moving power. The experiment was made under favourable\r\ncircumstances: little disturbance was produced from the\r\natmosphere; the day was quite calm. In the same experiment it was\r\nfound that the water evaporated varied very nearly in proportion\r\nto the varying resistance, and the amount of that evaporation may\r\nbe taken as affording an approximation to the mean amount of\r\nresistance. Taking the trip to and from Birmingham over the\r\ndistance of 190 miles, the mean evaporation per mile was 3·36\r\ncubic feet of water. The volume of steam produced by this quantity\r\nof water will be determined approximately by calculating the\r\nnumber of revolutions of the driving wheels necessary to move the\r\nengine one mile. The driving wheels being 5 feet in diameter,\r\ntheir circumference was 15·7 feet, and consequently in passing\r\nover a mile they would have revolved 336·3 times. Since each\r\nrevolution consumes four cylinders full of steam, the quantity of\r\nsteam supplied by the boiler to the cylinders per mile will be\r\nfound by multiplying the contents of the cylinder by four times\r\n336·3, or 1345·2.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders of the Hecla were 12-1/2 inches diameter, and 18\r\ninches in length, and consequently their contents were 1·28 cubic\r\nfeet for each cylinder: this being multiplied by 1345·2 gives\r\n1721·86 or 1722 cubic feet of steam per mile. It appears,\r\ntherefore, that supposing the priming either nothing or\r\ninsignificant, which was considered to be the case in these\r\nexperiments, 3·36 cubic feet of water produced 1722 cubic feet of\r\nsteam, of the density worked in the cylinders. The ratio,\r\ntherefore, of the volume of this steam to that of the water\r\nproducing it, was 1722 to 3·36, or 512·5 to 1. The pressure of\r\nsteam of this density would be 54·5 pounds per square inch.[34]\r\nSuch, therefore, was the limit of the average total pressure of\r\nthe steam in the cylinders. In this experiment the safety-valve of\r\nthe boiler was screwed down to 60 pounds per square [Pg414] inch\r\nabove the atmospheric pressure, which was therefore the major\r\nlimit of the pressure of steam in the boiler; but as the actual\r\npressure in the boiler must have been less than this amount, the\r\ndifference between the pressure in the cylinder and boiler could\r\nnot be ascertained. This difference, however, would produce no\r\neffect on the moving power of the steam, since the pressure of\r\nsteam in the cylinders obtained by the above calculation is quite\r\nindependent of the pressure in the boiler, or of any source of\r\nerror except what might arise from priming. The pressure of 54·5\r\npounds per square inch, calculated above, being the total pressure\r\nof the steam on the pistons, let 14·5 pounds be deducted from it,\r\nto represent the atmospheric pressure against which the piston\r\nmust act, and the remaining 40 pounds per square inch will\r\nrepresent the whole available force drawing the train and\r\novercoming all the resistances arising from the machinery of the\r\nengine, including that of the blast-pipe. The magnitude of a\r\n12-1/2 inch piston being 122·7 square inches, the total area of\r\nthe two pistons would be 245·2 square inches, and the pressure\r\nupon each of 40 pounds per inch would give a total force of 9816\r\non the two pistons. Since this force must act through a space of\r\nthree feet, while the train is impelled through a space of 15·7\r\nfeet, it must be reduced in the proportion of 3 to 15·7, to obtain\r\nits effect at the point of contact of the wheels upon the rails:\r\nthis will give 1875 pounds as the total force exerted in the\r\ndirection of the motion of the train. The gross weight of the\r\ntrain being 80 tons, including the engine and tender, this would\r\ngive a gross moving force along the road of about 23·4 pounds per\r\nton of the gross load, this force being understood to include all\r\nthe resistances due to the engine. This resistance corresponds to\r\nthe gravitation of a plane rising at the rate of 1/95, and\r\ntherefore it appears that such would be the inclination of the\r\nplane by the gravitation of which the gross resistance would be\r\ndoubled, instead of such inclination being about 1/300, as has\r\nbeen hitherto supposed.\r\n\r\nSince the remarkable and unexpected results of this series of\r\nexperiments became known various circumstances were brought to\r\nlight, which were before unnoticed, and which [Pg415] abundantly\r\nconfirm them. Among these may be mentioned the fact, that in\r\ndescending the Madeley plane, on the Grand Junction Railway, which\r\nfalls for above three miles at the rate of twenty-nine feet a\r\nmile, the steam can never be entirely cut off. But, on the other\r\nhand, to maintain the necessary speed in descending, the power of\r\nthe engine is always necessary. As this plane greatly exceeds that\r\nwhich would be sufficient to cause the free motion of the train\r\ndown it, the power of the engine expended in descending it,\r\nbesides all that part of the gravitating power of the plane which\r\nexceeds the resistance due to friction and other mechanical causes\r\nmust be worked against the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThis estimate of the resistance is also in conformity with the\r\nresults of a variety of experiments made by me with trains of\r\ndifferent magnitudes down inclined planes of various inclinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n(202.) In laying out a line of railway the disposition of the\r\ngradients should be such as to preserve among them as uniform a\r\ncharacter as is practicable, for the weight and power of the\r\nengine must necessarily be regulated by the general steepness of\r\nthe gradients. Thus if upon a railway which is generally level,\r\nlike that between Liverpool and Manchester, one or two inclined\r\nplanes of a very steep character occur, as happens upon that line,\r\nthen the engine which is constructed to work upon the general\r\ngradients of the road is unfit to draw the same load up those\r\ninclinations which form an exception to the general character of\r\nthe gradients. In such cases some extraordinary means must\r\ngenerally be provided for surmounting those exceptionable\r\ninclinations. Several expedients have been proposed for this\r\npurpose, among which the following may be mentioned:—\r\n\r\n1. Upon arriving at the foot of the plane the load is divided, and\r\nthe engine carries it up in several successive trips, descending\r\nthe plane unloaded after each trip. The objection to this method\r\nis the delay which it occasions—a circumstance which is\r\nincompatible with a large transport of passengers. From what has\r\nbeen stated, it would be necessary, when the engine is fully\r\nloaded on a level, to divide its load into two or more parts, to\r\nbe successively [Pg416] carried up when the incline rises 52 feet\r\nper mile. This method has been practised in the transport of\r\nmerchandise occasionally, when heavy loads were carried on the\r\nLiverpool and Manchester line, upon the Rainhill incline.\r\n\r\n2. A subsidiary or assistant locomotive engine may be kept in\r\nconstant readiness at the foot of each incline, for the purpose of\r\naiding the different trains, as they arrive, in ascending. The\r\nobjection to this method is the cost of keeping such an engine\r\nwith its boiler continually prepared, and its steam up. It is\r\nnecessary to keep its fire continually lighted, whether employed\r\nor not; otherwise, when the train would arrive at the foot of the\r\nincline, it should wait until the subsidiary engine was prepared\r\nfor work. In cases where trains would start and arrive at stated\r\ntimes, this objection, however, would have less force. This method\r\nis at present generally adopted on the Liverpool and Manchester\r\nline.\r\n\r\n3. A fixed steam-engine may be erected on the crest of the\r\nincline, so as to communicate by ropes with the train at the foot.\r\nSuch an engine would be capable of drawing up one or two trains\r\ntogether, with their locomotives, according as they would arrive,\r\nand no delay need be occasioned. This method requires that the\r\nfixed engine should be kept constantly prepared for work, and the\r\nsteam continually up in the boiler.\r\n\r\n4. In working on the level, the communication between the boiler\r\nand the cylinder in the locomotives may be so restrained by\r\npartially closing the throttle-valve, as to cause the pressure\r\nupon the piston to be less in a considerable degree than the\r\npressure of steam in the boiler. If under such circumstances a\r\nsufficient pressure upon the piston can be obtained to draw the\r\nload on the level, the throttle-valve may be opened on approaching\r\nthe inclined plane, so as to throw on the piston a pressure\r\nincreased in the same proportion as the previous pressure in the\r\nboiler was greater than that upon the piston. If the fire be\r\nsufficiently active to keep up the supply of steam in this manner\r\nduring the ascent, and if the rise be not greater in proportion\r\nthan the power thus obtained, the locomotive will draw the load up\r\nthe incline without further assistance. It is, however, to be\r\nobserved, that in this case [Pg417] the load upon the engine must\r\nbe less than the amount which the adhesion of its working wheels\r\nwith the railroad is capable of drawing; for this adhesion must be\r\nadequate to the traction of the same load up the incline,\r\notherwise, whatever increase of power might be obtained by opening\r\nthe throttle-valve, the drawing wheels would revolve without\r\ncausing the load to advance. This method has been generally\r\npractised upon the Liverpool and Manchester line in the transport\r\nof passengers; and, indeed, it is the only method yet discovered\r\nwhich is consistent with the expedition necessary for that species\r\nof traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the practice of this method considerable aid may be derived\r\nalso by suspending the supply of feeding water to the boiler\r\nduring the ascent. It will be recollected that a reservoir of cold\r\nwater is placed in the tender which follows the engine, and that\r\nthe water is driven from this reservoir into the boiler by a\r\nforcing pump, which is worked by the engine itself. This pump is\r\nso constructed that it will supply as much cold water as is equal\r\nto the evaporation, so as to maintain constantly the same quantity\r\nof water in the boiler. But it is evident, on the other hand, that\r\nthe supply of this water has a tendency to check the rate of\r\nevaporation, since in being raised to the temperature of the water\r\nwith which it mixes it must absorb a considerable portion of the\r\nheat supplied by the fire. With a view to accelerate the\r\nproduction of steam, therefore, in ascending the inclines, the\r\nengine man may suspend the action of the forcing pump, and thereby\r\nstop the supply of cold water to the boiler; the evaporation will\r\ngo on with increased rapidity, and the exhaustion of water\r\nproduced by it will be repaid by the forcing pump on the next\r\nlevel, or still more effectually on the next descending incline.\r\nIndeed the feeding pump may be made to act in descending an\r\nincline, if necessary, when the action of the engine itself is\r\nsuspended, and when the train descends by its own gravity, in\r\nwhich case it will perform the part of a brake upon the descending\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\n5. The mechanical connexion between the piston of the cylinder and\r\nthe points of contact of the working wheels with the road may be\r\nso altered, upon arriving at the incline, as to [Pg418] give the\r\npiston a greater power over the working wheels. This may be done\r\nin an infinite variety of ways, but hitherto no method has been\r\nsuggested sufficiently simple to be applicable in practice; and\r\neven were any means suggested which would accomplish this, unless\r\nthe intensity of the impelling power were at the same time\r\nincreased, it would necessarily follow that the speed of the\r\nmotion would be diminished in exactly the same proportion as the\r\npower of the piston over the working wheels would be increased.\r\nThus, on the inclined plane, which rises fifty-five feet per mile,\r\nupon the Liverpool line, the speed would be diminished to nearly\r\none fourth of its amount upon the level.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [30] Some of the preceding observations on inland transport,\r\n  as well as other parts of the present chapter, appeared in\r\n  articles written by me in the _Edinburgh Review_ for October,\r\n  1832, and October, 1834.\r\n\r\n  [31] Wood on Railroads, 2d edit.\r\n\r\n  [32] The cost of coke has risen considerably since the date of\r\n  this report.\r\n\r\n  [33] I am indebted to the enlarged edition of Tredgold on the\r\n  Steam Engine, published by Mr. Weale, for the drawings of this\r\n  engine.

CHURCH'S STEAM ENGINE.\r\n\r\n\r\n(203.) We have hitherto confined our observations on steam-power,\r\nas a means of transport by land, to its application on railways.\r\nBut modern speculation has not stopped there; various attempts\r\nhave been made, and attended with more or less success, to work\r\nsteam-carriages on common roads. The mere practicability of this\r\nproject had long been regarded as very questionable; but enough\r\nhas been done to show that the only doubt which can attend it, is\r\nas to whether it can be profitably resorted to, as a means of\r\ntransport, and this question [Pg420] has been materially affected\r\nby the recent extension of railways. In comparing the effect of a\r\nstone road with an iron railway, there are two circumstances which\r\ngive great superiority and advantage to the latter: first, the\r\nresistance opposed by a railway to the moving power, no matter\r\nwhat that moving power may be, is considerably less in proportion\r\nto the load than on a stone road. The average resistance on a good\r\nlevel stone road, to the motion of carriages drawn at the speed\r\nusually attained by the application of horse-power, may be taken\r\nat about a thirty-sixth part of the load, while the resistance to\r\na load drawn upon a railway _at the same speed_ probably does not\r\namount to a tenth part of this resistance. Thus the moving power,\r\nwhatever it may be, would produce on a railway ten times the\r\nuseful effect which it would produce on a stone road; secondly,\r\nthe resistance which is opposed to the moving power on a level\r\nrailway is much more uniform than on a stone road, and,\r\nconsequently, the moving power is less subjected to jerks and\r\ninequalities. This renders the application of inanimate power more\r\neasy on the railway. Those inequalities of surface which increase\r\nthe amount of resistance on stone roads as compared with railways\r\nalso produce a jolting motion in the carriage, to counteract\r\nwhich, the use of springs become necessary. These springs render\r\nthe motion of that part of the carriage which rests upon them\r\ndifferent from that part of the carriage which supports them; and\r\nin the application of steam-machinery it becomes necessary so to\r\nconnect the moving power with the wheels that the machinery may\r\nhave one motion, and the wheels which are put in mechanical\r\nconnexion with that machinery, and driven by it, shall have\r\nanother motion. This, it is true, is the case with locomotive\r\nengines on railways; but owing to the greater smoothness and\r\nequality of the railway surface the difference between the motion\r\nof the carriage body suspended on springs and that of the wheels\r\nis much less than it would be on a stone road.\r\n\r\nBut besides the greater smoothness of railways compared with stone\r\nroads, the latter have another disadvantage, the effects of which\r\nhave probably been exaggerated by those who are opposed to this\r\napplication of steam-power. One of the [Pg421] laws of adhesion\r\nlong since developed by experiment, and established as a principle\r\nof practical science, is that the adhesion is greater between\r\nsurfaces of the same than between surfaces of a different kind. Thus\r\nbetween two metals of the same kind, the adhesion corresponding to\r\nany given pressure is greater than between two metals of different\r\nkinds; between two metals of any sort the adhesion is greater than\r\nbetween metal and stone, or between metal and wood. Hence, the\r\nwheels of steam-carriages running on a railroad have a greater\r\nadhesion with the road, and therefore offer a greater resistance to\r\nslip round without the advance of the carriage, than wheels would\r\noffer on a turnpike road; for on a railroad the iron tire of the\r\nwheel rests in contact with the iron rail, while on a common road\r\nthe iron tire rests in contact with the surface of stone, or\r\nwhatever material the road may be composed of. Besides this, the\r\ndust and loose matter which necessarily collect on a common road,\r\nwhen pressed between the wheels and the solid base of the road, act\r\nsomewhat in the manner of rollers, and give the wheels a greater\r\nfacility to slip than if the road were swept clean, and the wheels\r\nrested in immediate contact with its hard surface. The truth of this\r\nobservation is illustrated on the railroads themselves, where the\r\nadhesion is found to be diminished whenever the rails are covered\r\nwith any extraneous matter, such as dust or moist clay. Although the\r\nadhesion of the wheels of a carriage with a common road, however, be\r\nless than those of the wheels of a steam-carriage with a railroad,\r\nyet still the actual adhesion on turnpike roads is greater in amount\r\nthan has been generally supposed, and is quite sufficient to propel\r\ncarriages drawing after them loads of large amount.\r\n\r\nThe relative facility with which carriages are propelled on\r\nrailroads and turnpike-roads equally affects any moving power,\r\nwhether that of horses or steam engines; and whether loads be\r\npropelled by the one power or the other, the railroad, as compared\r\nwith the turnpike-road, will always possess the same proportionate\r\nadvantage; and a given amount of power, whether of the one kind or\r\nthe other, will always perform a quantity of work less in the same\r\nproportion on a [Pg422] turnpike-road than on a rail-road. But, on\r\nthe other hand, the expense of original construction, and of\r\nmaintaining the repairs of a rail-road, is to be placed against the\r\ncertain facility which it offers to draught.\r\n\r\nIn the attempts which have been made to adapt locomotive engines to\r\nturnpike-roads, the projectors have aimed at the accomplishment of\r\ntwo objects: first, the construction of lighter and smaller engines;\r\nand, secondly, increased power. These ends, it is plain, can only be\r\nattained, with our present knowledge, by the production of steam of\r\nvery high temperature and pressure, so that the smallest volume of\r\nsteam shall produce the greatest possible mechanical effect. The\r\nmethods of propelling the carriage have been in general similar to\r\nthat used in the railroad engines, viz. either by cranks placed on\r\nthe axles, the wheels being fixed upon the same axles, or by\r\nconnecting the piston rods with the spokes of the wheels. In some\r\ncarriages, the boiler and moving power, and the body of the carriage\r\nwhich bears the passengers, are placed on the same wheels. In\r\nothers, the engine is placed on a separate carriage, and draws after\r\nit the carriage which transports the passengers, as is always the\r\ncase on railways.\r\n\r\nThe chief difference between the steam engines used on railways, and\r\nthose adapted to propel carriages on turnpike roads, is in the\r\nstructure of the boiler. In the latter it is essential that, while\r\nthe power remains undiminished, the boiler should be lighter and\r\nsmaller. The accomplishment of this has been attempted by various\r\ncontrivances for so distributing the water as to expose a\r\nconsiderable quantity of surface in contact with it to the action of\r\nthe fire: spreading it in thin layers on flat plates; inserting it\r\nbetween plates of iron placed at a small distance asunder, the fire\r\nbeing admitted between the intermediate plates; dividing it into\r\nsmall tubes, round which the fire has play; introducing it between\r\nthe surfaces of cylinders placed one within another, the fire being\r\nadmitted between the alternate cylinders,—have all been resorted to\r\nby different projectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n(204.) First and most prominent in the history of the application of\r\nsteam to the propelling of carriages on turnpike roads stands the\r\nname of Mr. Goldsworthy Gurney, a medical [Pg423] gentleman, and\r\nscientific chemist, of Cornwall. In 1822, Mr. Gurney succeeded Dr.\r\nThompson as lecturer on chemistry at the Surrey Institution; and, in\r\nconsequence of the results of some experiments on heat, his\r\nattention was directed to the project of working steam-carriages on\r\ncommon roads; and he subsequently devoted his exertions in\r\nperfecting a steam-engine capable of attaining the end he had in\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThe mistake which so long prevailed in the application of\r\nlocomotives on railroads, and which, as we have shown, materially\r\nretarded the progress of that invention, was shared by Mr. Gurney.\r\nWithout reducing the question to the test of experiment, he took for\r\ngranted, in his first attempts, that the adhesion of the wheels with\r\nthe road was too slight to propel the carriage. He was assured, he\r\nsays, by eminent engineers, that this was a point settled by actual\r\nexperiment. It is strange, however, that a person of his quickness\r\nand sagacity did not inquire after the particulars of these \"actual\r\nexperiments.\" So, however, it was; and, taking for granted the\r\ninability of the wheels to propel, he wasted much labour and skill\r\nin the contrivance of levers and propellers, which acted on the\r\nground in a manner somewhat resembling the feet of horses, to drive\r\nthe carriage forward. After various fruitless attempts of this kind,\r\nthe experience acquired in the trials to which they gave rise at\r\nlast forced the truth upon his notice, and he found that the\r\nadhesion of the wheels was not only sufficient to propel the\r\ncarriage heavily laden on level roads, but was capable of causing it\r\nto ascend all the hills which occur on ordinary turnpike-roads. In\r\nthis manner it ascended all the hills between London and Barnet,\r\nLondon and Stanmore, Stanmore Hill, Brockley Hill, and mounted Old\r\nHighgate Hill, the last at one point rising one foot in nine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 114.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 115.]\r\n\r\nThe boiler of Mr. Gurney's engine is so constructed, that there is\r\nno part of it in which metal exposed to the action of the fire is\r\nout of contact with water. If it be considered how rapidly the\r\naction of an intense furnace destroys metal when water is not\r\npresent to prevent the heat from accumulating, the advantage of\r\nthis circumstance will be appreciated. In the boiler of Mr.\r\nGurney, the grate-bars [Pg424] themselves are tubes filled with\r\nwater, and form, in fact, a part of the boiler itself. This boiler\r\nconsists of three strong metal cylinders placed in a horizontal\r\nposition one above the other. A section, made by a perpendicular\r\nor vertical plane, is represented in _fig._ 114. The ends of the\r\nthree cylinders just mentioned are represented at D, H, and I. In\r\nthe side of the lowest cylinder D are inserted a row of tubes, a\r\nground plan of which is represented in _fig._ 115. These tubes,\r\nproceeding from the side of the lowest cylinder D, are inclined\r\n[Pg425] slightly upwards, for a reason which I shall presently\r\nexplain. From the nature of the section, only one of these tubes\r\nis visible in _fig._ 114. at C. The other extremities of these\r\ntubes at A are connected with the same number of upright tubes,\r\none of which is shown at E. The upper extremities G of these\r\nupright tubes are connected with another set of tubes K, equal in\r\nnumber, proceeding from G, inclining slightly upwards, and\r\nterminating in the second cylinder H.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 116.]\r\n\r\nAn end view of the boiler is exhibited in _fig._ 116., where the\r\nthree cylinders are expressed by the same letters. Between the\r\ncylinders D and H there are two tubes of communication B, and two\r\nsimilar tubes between the cylinders H and I. From the nature of\r\nthe section these appear only as a single tube in _fig._ 114. From\r\nthe top of the cylinder I proceeds a tube N, by which steam is\r\nconducted to the engine.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that the space F is enclosed on every side by\r\na grating of tubes, which have free communication with the\r\ncylinders D and H, which cylinders have also a free communication\r\nwith each other by the tubes B. It follows, [Pg426] therefore,\r\nthat if water be supplied to the cylinder I, it will descend\r\nthrough the tubes, and first filling the cylinder D and the tubes\r\nC, will gradually rise in the tubes B and E, will next fill the\r\ntubes K and the cylinder H. The grating of water-pipes C E K forms\r\nthe furnace, the pipes C being the fire-bars, and the pipes E and\r\nK being the back and roof of the stove. The fire-door, for the\r\nsupply of fuel, appears at M, fig. 116. The flue issuing between\r\nthe tubes F is conducted over the tubes K, and the flame and hot\r\nair are carried off through a chimney. That portion of the heat of\r\nthe burning fuel, which in other furnaces destroys the bars of the\r\ngrate, is here expended in heating the water contained in the\r\ntubes C. The radiant heat of the fire acts upon the tubes K,\r\nforming the roof of the furnace, on the tube E at the back of it,\r\nand partially on the cylinders D and H, and the tubes B. The draft\r\nof hot air and flame passing into the flue at A acts upon the\r\nposterior surfaces of the tubes E, and the upper sides of the\r\ntubes K, and finally passes into the chimney.\r\n\r\nAs the water in the tubes C E K is heated, it becomes specifically\r\nlighter than water of a less temperature, and consequently\r\nacquires a tendency to ascend. It passes, therefore, rapidly into\r\nH. Meanwhile the colder portions descend, and the inclined\r\npositions of the tubes C and K give play to this tendency of the\r\nheated water, so that a prodigiously rapid circulation is\r\nproduced, when the fire begins to act upon the tubes. When the\r\nwater acquires such a temperature that steam is rapidly produced,\r\nsteam-bubbles are constantly formed in the tubes surrounding the\r\nfire; and if these remained stationary in the tubes, the action of\r\nthe fire would not only decompose the steam, but render the tubes\r\nred hot, the water not passing through them to carry off the heat.\r\nBut the inclined position of the tubes, already noticed,\r\neffectually prevents this injurious consequence. A steam-bubble,\r\nwhich is formed either in the tubes C or K, having a tendency to\r\nascend proportional to its lightness as compared with water,\r\nnecessarily rushes upwards; if in C towards A, and if in K towards\r\nH. But this motion of the steam is also aided by the rapid\r\ncirculation of the water which is continually maintained [Pg427]\r\nin the tubes, otherwise it might be possible, notwithstanding the\r\nlevity of steam compared with water, that a bubble might remain in\r\na narrow tube without rising. To bring the matter to the test of\r\nexperiment, I have connected two cylinders, such as D and H, by a\r\nsystem of glass tubes, such as represented at C E K. The rapid and\r\nconstant circulation of the water was then made evident: bubbles\r\nof steam were formed in the tubes, it is true; but they passed\r\nwith great rapidity into the upper cylinder, and rose to the\r\nsurface, so that the glass tubes never acquired a higher\r\ntemperature than that of the water which passed through them.\r\n\r\nEvery part of the boiler being cylindrical, it has the form which,\r\nmechanically considered, is most favourable to strength, and\r\nwhich, within given dimensions, contains the greatest quantity of\r\nwater. It is also free from the defects arising from unequal\r\nexpansion, which are found to be most injurious in tubular\r\nboilers. The tubes C and K can freely expand in the direction of\r\ntheir length, without being loosened at their joints, and without\r\nstraining any part of the apparatus; the tubes E, being short, are\r\nsubject to a very slight degree of expansion; and it is obvious\r\nthat the long tubes, with which they are connected, will yield to\r\nthis without suffering a strain, and without causing any part of\r\nthe apparatus to be loosened.\r\n\r\nWhen water is converted into steam, any foreign matter which may\r\nbe combined with it is disengaged, and is deposited on the bottom\r\nof the vessel in which the water is evaporated. All boilers,\r\ntherefore, require occasional cleansing, to prevent the crust thus\r\nformed from accumulating; and this operation, for obvious reasons,\r\nis attended with peculiar difficulty in tubular boilers. In the\r\ncase before us, the crust of deposited matter would gather and\r\nthicken in the tubes C and K, and if not removed, would at length\r\nchoke them. But besides this, it would be attended with a still\r\nworse effect; for, being a bad conductor, it would intercept the\r\nheat in its transit from the fire to the water, and would cause\r\nthe metal of the tube to become unduly heated. Mr. Gurney of\r\ncourse foresaw this inconvenience, and contrived an ingenious\r\nchemical method of removing it, by occasionally injecting [Pg428]\r\nthrough the tubes such an acid as would combine with the deposit,\r\nand carry it away. This method was effectual; and although its\r\npractical application was found to be attended with difficulty in\r\nthe hands of common workmen, Mr. Gurney was persuaded to adhere to\r\nit by the late Dr. Wollaston, until experience proved the\r\nimpossibility of getting it effectually performed, under the\r\ncircumstances in which boilers are commonly used. Mr. Gurney then\r\nadopted a method of removing the deposit by mechanical means.\r\nOpposite the mouths of the tubes, and on the other side of the\r\ncylinders D and H, are placed a number of holes, which, when the\r\nboiler is in use, are stopped by pieces of metal screwed into\r\nthem. When the tubes require to be cleaned, these stoppers are\r\nremoved, and an iron scraper is introduced through the holes into\r\nthe tubes, which, being passed backwards and forwards, removes the\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\nIn these engines the draught through the furnace was produced by\r\nprojecting the waste steam up the chimneys as is practised in\r\nrailway engines; a method so perfectly effectual, that it is\r\nunlikely to be superseded by any other. The objection which has\r\nbeen urged against it in locomotive engines, working on\r\nturnpike-roads, is, that the noise which it produces has a\r\ntendency to frighten horses.\r\n\r\nIn the engines on the Liverpool road, the steam is allowed to pass\r\ndirectly from the eduction pipe of the cylinder to the chimney,\r\nand it there escapes in puffs corresponding with the alternate\r\nmotion of the pistons, and produces a noise, which, although\r\nattended with no inconvenience on the railroad, would perhaps be\r\nobjectionable on turnpike-roads. In the engine used in Mr.\r\nGurney's steam-carriage, the steam which passes from the cylinders\r\nis conducted to a receptacle, which he calls a blowing box. This\r\nbox serves the same purpose as the upper chamber of a smith's\r\nbellows. It receives the steam from the cylinders in alternate\r\npuffs, but lets it escape into the chimney in a continued stream\r\nby a number of small jets. Regular draught is by this means\r\nproduced, and no noise is perceived. Another exit for the steam is\r\nalso provided, by which the conductor is enabled to increase or\r\ndiminish, or to suspend altogether, the draught [Pg429] in the\r\nchimney, so as to adapt the intensity of the fire to the\r\nexigencies of the road. This is a great convenience in practice;\r\nbecause on some roads a draught is scarcely required, while on\r\nothers a powerful blast is indispensable.\r\n\r\nConnected with this blowing box is another apparatus of\r\nconsiderable practical importance. The pipe through which the\r\nfeeding water is conducted from the tank is carried through this\r\nblowing box, within which it is coiled in a spiral form, so that\r\nan extensive thread of the water is exposed to the heat of the\r\nwaste steam which has escaped from the cylinders, and which is\r\nenclosed in this blowing box. In passing through this pipe the\r\nfeeding water is raised from the ordinary temperature of about 60°\r\nto the temperature of 212°. Fuel is thus economised and weight\r\ndiminished; but there is another still greater advantage attending\r\nthis process. The feeding water in the worm just mentioned, while\r\nit takes up the heat from the surrounding steam in the blowing\r\nbox, condenses a part of the waste steam, which is thence\r\nconducted to the tank, from which the feeding water is pumped.\r\n\r\nWhen steam is generated so rapidly as is necessarily the case in\r\nlocomotive boilers, it rises with great violence in numerous\r\nbubbles from the bottom of the boiler to the surface of the water,\r\nand puts the liquid into a state of foaming turbulence not unlike\r\nthe sea in a storm. As the steam rushes from the surface into the\r\nupper part of the boiler, under these circumstances, it carries\r\nwith it a spray by which water is scattered in minute subdivision\r\namong the steam, and floats there like the spray which rises from\r\nthe base of a cascade. If the steam be conducted immediately to\r\nthe cylinder from the boiler in this state, it will carry with it\r\nthe water which is thus suspended in it, which will pass through\r\nthe cylinder, and finally be driven into the atmosphere upon the\r\nreturning stroke of the piston. The hot water thus carried off\r\npossesses none of the mechanical properties of steam, and is\r\nwholly inefficient as a moving power, and is therefore an\r\nextensive source of the waste of heat. In every boiler, some means\r\nshould be provided for the separation of the water thus suspended\r\nin the steam, before the steam is conducted to the cylinder. In\r\nordinary boilers, the large space which [Pg430] remains above the\r\nsurface of the water serves this purpose. The steam being there\r\nsubject to no agitation or disturbance, the water mechanically\r\nsuspended in it descends by its own gravity, and leaves pure steam\r\nin the upper part. In the small tubular boilers, this has been a\r\nmatter, however, of greater difficulty. The contracted space in\r\nwhich the ebullition takes place causes the water to be mixed with\r\nthe steam in a greater quantity than could happen in common\r\nboilers; and the want of the same steam-room renders the\r\nseparation of the water from the steam a matter of some\r\ndifficulty. These inconveniences have been attempted to be\r\novercome by various contrivances. I have already described the\r\nrapid and regular circulation effected by the arrangement of the\r\ntubes. By this a regularity in the currents is established, which\r\nhas a tendency to diminish the mixture of water with the steam. In\r\naddition to this, a method of separation is provided in the vessel\r\nI, which is a strong iron cylinder of some magnitude, placed out\r\nof the immediate influence of the fire. A partial separation of\r\nthe steam from the water takes place in the cylinder H; and the\r\nsteam with the water mechanically suspended in it, technically\r\ncalled moist steam, rises into the _separator_ I. Here, being free\r\nfrom all agitation and currents, and being, in fact, quiescent,\r\nthe particles of water fall to the bottom, while the pure steam\r\nremains at the top. This separator, therefore, serves all the\r\npurposes of the steam-room above the surface of the water in the\r\nlarge plate boilers. The dry steam is thus collected and ready for\r\nthe supply of the engine through the tube N, while the water,\r\nwhich is disengaged from it, is collected at the bottom of the\r\nseparator, and is conducted through the tube T to the lowest\r\nvessel D, to be again circulated through the boiler.\r\n\r\nThe pistons of the engine work on the axles of the hind wheels of\r\nthe carriage which bears the engine, by cranks, as in the\r\nlocomotives on the Manchester railway, so that the axle is kept in\r\na constant state of rotation while the engine is at work. The\r\nwheels placed on this axle are not permanently fixed or keyed upon\r\nit, as in the Manchester locomotives; but they are capable of\r\nturning upon it in the same manner as ordinary carriage wheels.\r\nImmediately within [Pg431] these wheels there are fixed upon the\r\naxles two projecting spokes or levers, which revolve with the\r\naxle, and which take the position of two opposite spokes of the\r\nwheel. These may be occasionally attached to the wheel or detached\r\nfrom it; so that they are capable of compelling the wheels to turn\r\nwith the axle, or leaving the axle free to turn independently of\r\nthe wheel, or the wheel independent of the axle, at the pleasure\r\nof the conductor. It is by these levers that the engine is made to\r\npropel either or both of the wheels. If both pairs of spokes are\r\nthrown into connexion with the wheels, the crank shaft or axle\r\nwill cause both wheels to turn with it, and in that case the\r\noperation of the carriage is precisely the same as those of the\r\nlocomotives already described upon the Liverpool and Manchester\r\nline; but this is rarely found to be necessary, since the adhesion\r\nof one wheel with the road is generally sufficient to propel the\r\ncarriage, and consequently only one pair of these fixed levers are\r\nused, and the carriage propelled by only one of the two hind\r\nwheels. The fore wheels of the carriage turn upon a pivot similar\r\nto those of a four-wheeled coach. The position of these wheels is\r\nchanged at pleasure by a pinion and circular rack, which is moved\r\nby the conductor, and in this manner the carriage is guided with\r\nprecision and facility.\r\n\r\nThe force of traction necessary to propel a carriage upon common\r\nroads must vary with the variable quality of the road, and\r\nconsequently the propelling power, or the pressure upon the pistons\r\nof the engine, must be susceptible of a corresponding variation; but\r\na still greater variation becomes necessary from the undulations and\r\nhills which are upon all ordinary roads. This necessary change in\r\nthe intensity of the impelling power is obtained by restraining the\r\nsteam in the boiler by the throttle-valve, as already described in\r\nthe locomotive engines on the railroad. This principle, however, is\r\ncarried much further in the present case. The steam in the boiler\r\nmaybe at a pressure of from 100 to 200 lbs. on the square inch;\r\nwhile the steam on the working piston may not exceed 30 or 40 lbs.\r\non the inch. Thus an immense increase of power is always at the\r\ncommand of the conductor; so that when a hill is encountered, or a\r\nrough piece of road, [Pg432] he is enabled to lay on power\r\nsufficient to meet the exigency of the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe two difficulties which have been always apprehended in the\r\npractical working of steam-carriages upon common roads are, first,\r\nthe command of sufficient power for hills and rough pieces of\r\nroad; and, secondly, the apprehended insufficiency of the adhesion\r\nof the wheels with the road to propel the carriage. The former of\r\nthese difficulties has been met by allowing steam of very great\r\npressure to be constantly maintained in the boiler with perfect\r\nsafety. As to the second, all experiments tend to show that there\r\nis no ground for the supposition that the adhesion of the wheels\r\nis in any case insufficient for the purposes of propulsion. Mr.\r\nGurney states, that he has succeeded in driving carriages thus\r\npropelled, up considerable hills on the turnpike roads about\r\nLondon. He made a journey to Barnet with only one wheel attached\r\nto the axle, which was found sufficient to propel the carriage up\r\nall hills upon that road. The same carriage, with only one\r\npropelling wheel, also went to Bath, and surmounted all the hills\r\nbetween Cranford Bridge and Bath, going and returning.\r\n\r\nA double stroke of the piston produces one revolution of the\r\npropelling wheels, and causes the carriage to move through a space\r\nequal to the circumference of those wheels. It will therefore be\r\nobvious, that the greater the diameter of the wheels, the better\r\nadapted the carriage is for speed; and, on the other hand, wheels\r\nof smaller diameter are better adapted for power. In fact, the\r\npropelling power of an engine on the wheels will be in the inverse\r\nproportion of their diameter. In carriages designed to carry great\r\nweights at a moderate speed, smaller wheels will be used; while in\r\nthose intended for the transport of passengers at considerable\r\nvelocities, wheels of at least 5 feet diameter are most\r\nadvantageous.\r\n\r\n\r\n(205.) Among the numerous popular prejudices to which this new\r\ninvention has given rise, one of the most mischievous in its\r\neffects and most glaring in its falsehood, is the notion that\r\ncarriages thus propelled are more injurious to roads than\r\ncarriages drawn by horses. This error has been successfully\r\nexposed in the evidence taken before the committee of the [Pg433]\r\nHouse of Commons upon steam carriages. It is there demonstrated,\r\nnot only that carriages thus propelled do not wear a turnpike road\r\nmore rapidly than those drawn by horses, but that, on the other\r\nhand, the wear by the feet of horses is far more rapid and\r\ndestructive than any which could be produced by the wheels of\r\ncarriages. Steam carriages admit of having the tires of the wheels\r\nbroad, so as to act upon the road more in the manner of rollers,\r\nand thereby to give consistency and firmness to the material of\r\nwhich the road is composed. The driving wheels being proved not to\r\nslip upon the road, do not produce any effects more injurious than\r\nthe ordinary rolling wheels; consequently the wear occasioned by a\r\nsteam carriage upon a road, is not more than that produced by a\r\ncarriage drawn by horses, of an equivalent weight and the same or\r\nequal tires; but the wear produced by the pounding and digging of\r\nhorses' feet in draught is many times greater than that produced\r\nby the wear of any carriage. Those who still have doubts upon this\r\nsubject, if there be any such persons, will be fully satisfied by\r\nreferring to the evidence which accompanies the report of the\r\ncommittee of the House of Commons, printed in October, 1831.\r\n\r\nThe weight of machinery necessary for steam carriages is sometimes\r\nurged as an objection to their practical utility. Mr. Gurney\r\nstates, that, by successive improvements in the details of the\r\nmachinery, the weight of his carriages, without losing any of the\r\npropelling power, may be reduced to 35 cwt., exclusive of the\r\nload, and fuel and water: but thinks that it is possible to reduce\r\nthe weight still further.\r\n\r\nA steam carriage constructed by Mr. Gurney, weighing 35 cwt.,\r\nworking for 8 hours, is found, according to his statement, to do\r\nthe work of about 30 horses. He calculates that the weight of his\r\npropelling carriage, which would be capable of drawing 18 persons,\r\nwould be equal to the weight of 4 horses; and the carriage in\r\nwhich these persons would be drawn would have the same weight as a\r\ncommon stage coach capable of carrying the same number of persons.\r\nThus the weight of the whole—the propelling carriage and the\r\ncarriage for passengers taken together—would be the same [Pg434]\r\nwith the weight of a common stage coach, with 4 horses inclusive.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of applying locomotives upon common roads to\r\nthe transport of passengers or goods; the one is by causing the\r\nlocomotive to carry, and the other to draw the load; and different\r\nprojectors have adopted the one and the other method. Each is\r\nattended with its advantages and disadvantages. If the same\r\ncarriage transport the engine and the load, the weight of the\r\nwhole will be less in proportion to the load carried; also a\r\ngreater pressure may be produced on the wheels by which the load\r\nis propelled. It is also thought that a greater facility in\r\nturning and guiding the vehicle, greater safety in descending the\r\nhills, and a saving in the original cost, will be obtained. On the\r\nother hand, when the passengers are placed in the same carriage\r\nwith the engine, they are necessarily more exposed to the noise of\r\nthe machinery and to the heat of the boiler and furnace. The\r\ndanger of explosion is so slight, that, perhaps, it scarcely\r\ndeserves to be mentioned; but still _the apprehension_ of danger\r\non the part of the passengers, even though groundless, should not\r\nbe disregarded. This apprehension will be obviously removed or\r\ndiminished by transferring the passengers into a carriage separate\r\nfrom the engine; but the greatest advantage of keeping the engine\r\nseparate from the passengers is the facility which it affords of\r\nchanging one engine for another in case of accident or derangement\r\non the road, in the same manner as horses are changed at the\r\ndifferent stages: or, if such an accident occur in a place where a\r\nnew engine cannot be procured, the load of passengers may be\r\ncarried forward by horses, until it is brought to some station\r\nwhere a locomotive may be obtained. There is also an advantage\r\narising from the circumstance, that when the engines are under\r\nrepair, or in process of cleaning, the carriages for passengers\r\nare not necessarily idle. Thus the same number of carriages for\r\npassengers will not be required when the engine is used to draw as\r\nwhen it is used to carry.\r\n\r\nIn case of a very powerful engine being used to carry great loads,\r\nit would be quite impracticable to place the engine [Pg435] and\r\nloads on four wheels, the pressure being such as no turnpike road\r\ncould bear. In this case it would be indispensably necessary to\r\nplace a part of the load at least upon separate carriages to be\r\ndrawn by the engine.\r\n\r\nIn the comparison of carriages propelled by steam with carriages\r\ndrawn by horses, there is no respect in which the advantage of the\r\nformer is so apparent as the safety afforded to the passenger.\r\nSteam power is under the most perfect control, and a carriage thus\r\npropelled is capable of being guided with the most admirable\r\nprecision. It is also capable of being stopped almost suddenly,\r\nwhatever be its speed: it is capable of being turned within a\r\nspace considerably less than that which would be necessary for\r\nfour-horse coaches. In turning sharp corners, there is no danger,\r\nwith the most ordinary care on the part of the conductor. On the\r\nother hand, horse power, as is well known, is under very imperfect\r\ncontrol, especially when horses are used adapted to that speed\r\nwhich at present is generally considered necessary for the\r\npurposes of travelling. \"The danger of being run away with and\r\noverturned,\" says Mr. Farey, in his evidence before the House of\r\nCommons, \"is greatly diminished in a steam coach. It is very\r\ndifficult to control four such horses as can draw a heavy stage\r\ncoach ten miles an hour, in case they are frightened or choose to\r\nrun away; and, for such quick travelling, they must be kept in\r\nthat state of courage that they are always inclined to run away,\r\nparticularly down hill, and at sharp turns in the road. Steam\r\npower has very little corresponding danger, being perfectly\r\ncontrollable, and capable of having its power reversed, to retard\r\nin going down hill. It must be carelessness that would occasion\r\nthe overturning of a steam carriage. The chance of breaking down\r\nhas been hitherto considerable, but it will not be more than in\r\nstage coaches when the work is truly proportioned and properly\r\nexecuted. The risk from explosion of the boiler is the only new\r\ncause of danger, and that I consider not equivalent to the danger\r\nfrom horses.\"\r\n\r\nThat the risk of accident from explosion is extremely slight, may\r\nbe proved by the fact that the railway between Liverpool and\r\nManchester has now been in operation for about ten [Pg436] years,\r\nand that other railways more extensive in length have been worked\r\nfor a considerable time, and that no instance has ever yet\r\noccurred of an accident to passengers from the explosion of a\r\nboiler. Generally these machines, when they fail, are attended\r\nwith no other effect than the extinction of the fire, by the water\r\nof the boiler flowing in upon it. I am not aware of more than one\r\ninstance, in which a serious accident has been produced by\r\nexplosion; and in that instance, the sufferers were only the\r\nengineer and stoker. In the steam-engine of Mr. Gurney, the\r\ncarriage is drawn after the engine, as represented in _fig._ 117.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 117.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 118.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(206.) In the boiler to be used in the steam carriage projected by\r\nMr. Walter Hancock, the subdivision of the water is accomplished\r\nby dividing a case or box by a number of [Pg437] thin plates of\r\nmetal, like a galvanic battery, the water being allowed to flow\r\nbetween every alternate pair of plates, at E, _fig._ 118., and the\r\nintermediate spaces H forming the flue through which the flame and\r\nhot air are propelled.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a number of thin plates of water are exposed on both\r\nsides to the most intense action of flame and heated air; so that\r\nsteam of a high pressure is produced in great abundance and with\r\nconsiderable rapidity. The plates forming the boiler are bolted\r\ntogether by strong iron ties, extending across the boiler, at\r\nright angles to the plates, as represented in the figure. The\r\ndistance between the plates is two inches.\r\n\r\nThere are ten flat chambers of this kind for water, and\r\nintermediately between them ten flues. Under the flues is the\r\nfire-place, or grate, containing six square feet of fuel in vivid\r\ncombustion. The chambers are all filled to about two thirds of\r\ntheir depth with water, and the other third is left for steam. The\r\nwater chambers, throughout the whole series, communicate with each\r\nother both at top and bottom, and are held together by two large\r\nbolts. By releasing these bolts, at any time, the chambers fall\r\nasunder; and by screwing them up they may be all made tight again.\r\nThe water is supplied to the boiler by a forcing-pump, and the\r\nsteam issues from the centre of one of the flues at the top.\r\n\r\nThese boilers are constructed to bear a pressure of 400 or 500\r\nlbs. on the square inch; but the average pressure of the steam on\r\nthe safety valve is from 60 to 100. There are 100 square feet of\r\nsurface in contact with the water exposed to the fire. The stages\r\nwhich such an engine performs are eight miles, at the end of which\r\na fresh supply of fuel and water are taken in. It requires about\r\ntwo bushels of coke for each stage.\r\n\r\nThe steam carriage of Mr. Hancock differs from that of Mr. Gurney\r\nin this—that in the former the passengers and engine are all\r\nplaced on the same carriage. The boiler is placed behind the\r\ncarriage; and there is an engine-house between the boiler and the\r\npassengers, the latter being placed in the fore part of the\r\nvehicle; so that all the machinery is behind them. The carriages\r\nare adapted to carry 14 [Pg438] passengers, and weigh, exclusive\r\nof their load, about 3-1/2 tons, the tires of the wheels being\r\nabout 3-1/2 inches in breadth. Mr. Hancock states, that the\r\nconstruction of his boiler is of such a nature, that, even in the\r\ncase of bursting, no danger is to be apprehended, nor any other\r\ninconvenience than the stoppage of the carriage. He states that,\r\nwhile travelling about nine miles an hour, and working with a\r\npressure of about 100 lbs. on the square inch, loaded with\r\nthirteen passengers, the carriage was suddenly stopped. At first\r\nthe cause of the accident was not apparent; but, on opening one of\r\nthe cocks of the boiler, it was found that it contained neither\r\nsteam nor water. Further examination proved that the boiler had\r\nburst. On unscrewing the bolts, it was found that there were\r\nseveral large holes in the plates of the water-chamber, through\r\nwhich the water had flowed on the fire, but neither noise nor\r\nexplosion, nor any dangerous consequences, ensued.\r\n\r\n\r\n(207.) Mr. Nathaniel Ogle of Southampton obtained a patent for a\r\nlocomotive carriage, and worked it for some time experimentally;\r\nbut as his operations do not appear to have been continued, I\r\nsuppose he was unsuccessful in fulfilling those conditions,\r\nwithout which the machine could not be worked with economy and\r\nprofit. In his evidence before a committee of the House of\r\nCommons, he has thus described his contrivance:—\r\n\r\n\"The base of the boiler and the summit are composed of cross\r\npieces, cylindrical within and square without; there are holes\r\nbored through these cross pieces, and inserted through the whole\r\nis an air tube. The inner hole of the lower surface, and the under\r\nhole of the upper surface, are rather larger than the other ones.\r\nRound the air tube is placed a small cylinder, the collar of which\r\nfits round the larger aperture on the inner surface of the lower\r\nframe, and the under surface of the upper frame-work. These are\r\nboth drawn together by screws from the top; these cross pieces are\r\nunited by connecting pieces, the whole strongly bolted together;\r\nso that we obtain, in one tenth of the space, and with one tenth\r\nof the weight, the same heating surface and power as is now\r\nobtained in other and low-pressure boilers, with incalculably\r\n[Pg439] greater safety. Our present experimental boiler contains\r\n250 superficial feet of heating surface in the space of 3 feet 8\r\ninches high, 3 feet long, and 2 feet 4 inches broad, and weighs\r\nabout 8 cwt. We supply the two cylinders with steam, communicating\r\nby their pistons with a crank axle, to the ends of which either\r\none or both wheels are affixed as may be required. One wheel is\r\nfound to be sufficient, except under very difficult circumstances,\r\nand when the elevation is about one foot in six to impel the\r\nvehicle forward.\r\n\r\n\"The cylinders of which the boiler is composed are so small as to\r\nbear a greater pressure than could be produced by the quantity of\r\nfire beneath the boiler; and if any one of these cylinders should\r\nbe injured by violence, or any other way, it would become merely a\r\nsafety valve to the rest. We never, with the greatest pressure,\r\nburst, rent, or injured our boiler; and it has not once required\r\ncleaning, after having been in use twelve months.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Church of Birmingham has obtained a succession of patents for\r\ncontrivances connected with a locomotive engine for stone roads;\r\nand a company, consisting of a considerable number of individuals,\r\npossessing sufficient capital, has been formed in Birmingham, for\r\ncarrying into effect his designs, and working carriages on his\r\nprinciple. The present boiler of Dr. Church is formed of copper.\r\nThe water is contained between two sheets of copper, united\r\ntogether by copper nails, in a manner resembling the way in which\r\nthe cloth forming the top of a mattress or cushion is united with\r\nthe cloth which forms the bottom of it, except that the nails or\r\npins, which bind the sheets of copper, are much closer together.\r\nThe water, in fact, seems to be \"quilted\" or \"padded\" in between\r\ntwo sheets of thin copper. This double sheet of copper is formed\r\ninto an oblong rectangular box, the interior of which is the\r\nfire-place and ash-pit, and over the end of which is the\r\nsteam-chest. The great extent of surface exposed to the immediate\r\naction of the fire causes steam to be produced with great\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nVarious other projects for the application of steam engines on\r\ncommon roads were in a state of progressive improvement, [Pg440]\r\nwhen the greater advantages attending railways were considered so\r\nmanifest, that considerable doubts were raised, whether, supposing\r\nthe problem of the application of the steam engine on common roads\r\nto be successfully solved, it could ever be attended with the same\r\neconomy and effect, as by the adoption of a railway. Among the\r\nprojects which promised a successful issue, may be mentioned the\r\nlocomotive engines contrived by Messrs. Maudslay and Field, by\r\nColonel Maceroni, and by Mr. Scott Russell. These and others have,\r\nhowever, been abandoned, mainly, we believe, from the impression,\r\nthat wherever traffic can exist, sufficiently extensive to render\r\nthe application of steam power profitable, a railway must always\r\nsupersede a common road; and that, even in the limited traffic to\r\nbe expected on branches to the great railways, horse power applied\r\nto railways would be attended with more economy than steam power\r\napplied on stone roads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Pg441]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nCHAP.

Among the many ways in which the steam-engine has\r\nministered to the advancement of civilisation and the social\r\nprogress of the human race, there is none more [Pg442] important\r\nor more interesting than its application to navigation. Before it\r\nlent its giant powers to the propulsion of ships, locomotion over\r\nthe waters of the deep was attended with so much danger and\r\nuncertainty that, as a common proverb, it became the type and the\r\nrepresentative of every thing which was precarious and perilous.\r\nThe application, however, of steam to navigation has rescued the\r\nmariner and the voyager from many of the dangers of wind and\r\nwater; and even in its present state, putting out of view its\r\nprobable improvement, it has rendered all voyages of moderate\r\nlength as safe, and very nearly as regular, as journeys over-land.\r\nAs a means of transport by sea, the application of this power may\r\nbe considered as established; and it is now receiving improvements\r\nby which its extension to the longest class of ocean voyages is a\r\nquestion not of practicability, but merely of profit.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the steam-engine is rendered an instrument for\r\nthe propulsion of vessels must in its general features be so\r\nfamiliar to every one as to require but short explanation. A shaft\r\nis carried across the vessel, being continued on either side\r\nbeyond the timbers: to the extremities of this shaft, on the\r\noutside of the vessel, are fixed a pair of wheels constructed like\r\nundershot water-wheels, having attached to their rims a number of\r\nflat boards called _paddle-boards_. As the wheels revolve, these\r\npaddle-boards strike the water, driving it in a direction contrary\r\nto that in which it is intended the vessel should be propelled.\r\nThe moving force imparted to the water thus driven backwards is\r\nnecessarily accompanied by a re-action upon the vessel through the\r\nmedium of the paddle-shaft, by which the vessel is propelled\r\nforwards. On the paddle-shaft two cranks are constructed, similar\r\nto the cranks already described on the axle of the driving wheels\r\nof a locomotive engine. These cranks are placed at right angles to\r\neach other, so that when either is in its highest or lowest\r\nposition the other shall be horizontal. They are driven by two\r\nsteam-engines, which are placed in the hull of the vessel below\r\nthe paddle-shaft. In the earlier steam-boats a single steam-engine\r\nwas used, and in that case the unequal action of the engine on the\r\ncrank was equalised by a fly-wheel. This, however, has been long\r\n[Pg443] since abandoned in European vessels, and the use of two\r\nengines is now almost universal. By the relative position of the\r\ncranks it will be seen, that when either crank is at its dead\r\npoints, the other will be in the positions most favourable to its\r\naction, and in all intermediate positions the relative efficiency\r\nof the cranks will be such as to render their combined action very\r\nnearly uniform.\r\n\r\nThe steam-engines used to impel vessels may be either condensing\r\nengines, similar to those of Watt, and such as are used in\r\nmanufactures generally, or they may be non-condensing and\r\nhigh-pressure engines, similar in principle to those used on\r\nrailways. Low-pressure condensing engines are, however, universally\r\nused for marine purposes in Europe and to some extent in the United\r\nStates. In the latter country, however, high-pressure engines are\r\nalso in pretty general use, on rivers where lightness is a matter of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the parts of a marine engine differs in some\r\nrespects from that of a land engine. The limitation of space,\r\nwhich is unavoidable in a vessel, renders greater compactness\r\nnecessary. The paddle-shaft on which the cranks to be driven by\r\nthe engine are constructed being very little below the deck of the\r\nvessel, the beam and connecting rod could not be placed in the\r\nposition in which they usually are in land engines, without\r\ncarrying the machinery to a considerable elevation above the deck.\r\nThis is done in the steam-boat engines used on the American\r\nrivers; but it would be inadmissible in steam-boats in general,\r\nand more especially in sea-going steamers. The connecting rods,\r\ntherefore, instead of being presented downwards towards the cranks\r\nwhich they drive, must, in steam-vessels, be presented upwards,\r\nand the impelling force received from below. If, under these\r\ncircumstances, the beam were in the usual position above the\r\ncylinder and piston-rod, it must necessarily be placed between the\r\nengine and the paddle-shaft. This would require a depth for the\r\nmachinery which would be incompatible with the magnitude of the\r\nvessel. The beam, therefore, of marine engines, instead of being\r\nabove the cylinder and piston, is placed below them. To the top of\r\nthe [Pg445] piston-rods cross pieces are attached of greater\r\nlength than the diameter of the cylinders, so that their\r\nextremities shall project beyond the cylinders. To the ends of\r\nthese cross pieces are attached by joints the rods of a parallel\r\nmotion: these rods are carried downwards, and are connected with\r\nthe ends of two beams below the cylinder, and placed on either\r\nside of it. The opposite ends of these beams are connected by\r\nanother cross piece, to which is attached a connecting rod, which\r\nis continued upwards to the crank-pin, to which it is attached,\r\nand which it drives. Thus the beam, parallel motion, and\r\nconnecting rod of a marine engine, is similar to that of a land\r\nengine, only that it is turned upside down; and in consequence of\r\nthe impossibility of placing the beam directly over the\r\npiston-rod, two beams and two systems of parallel motion are\r\nprovided, one on each side of the engine, acted upon by, and\r\nacting on the piston-rod and crank by cross pieces.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of the cylinders differs from that usually observed\r\nin land engines, for like reasons. The length of the cylinder of\r\nland engines is generally greater than its diameter, in the\r\nproportion of about two to one. The cylinders of marine engines\r\nare, however, commonly constructed with a diameter very little\r\nless than their length. In proportion, therefore, to their power\r\ntheir stroke is shorter, which infers a corresponding shortness of\r\ncrank and a greater limitation of play of all the moving parts in\r\nthe vertical direction. The valves and the gearing by which they\r\nare worked, the air-pump, the condenser, and other parts of the\r\nmarine engines, do not materially differ from those already\r\ndescribed in land engines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 119.]\r\n\r\nThese arrangements of a marine engine will be more clearly\r\nunderstood by reference to _fig._ 119.[35], in which is\r\nrepresented a longitudinal section of a marine engine with its\r\nboiler as placed in a steam-vessel. The sleepers of oak,\r\nsupporting the engine, are represented at X, the base of the\r\nengine being secured to these by bolts passing through them\r\n[Pg446] and the bottom timbers of the vessel; S is the steam-pipe\r\nleading from the steam-chest in the boiler to the slides _c_, by\r\nwhich it is admitted to the top and bottom of the cylinder. The\r\ncondenser is represented at B, and the air-pump at E. The hot well\r\nis seen at F, from which the feed is taken for the boiler; L is\r\nthe piston-rod connected by the parallel motion _a_ with the beam\r\nH, working on a centre K, near the base of the engine. The other\r\nend of the beam I drives the connecting rod M, which extends\r\nupwards to the crank which it works upon the paddle-shaft O. Q R\r\nis the framing by which the engine is supported. The beam here\r\nexhibited is shown on dotted lines as being on the further side of\r\nthe engine. A similar beam similarly placed, and moving on the\r\nsame axis, must be understood to be at this side connected with\r\nthe cross head of the piston in like manner by a parallel motion,\r\nand with a cross piece attached to the lower end of the connecting\r\nrod and to the opposite beam. The eccentric which works the slides\r\nis placed upon the paddle shaft O, and the connecting arm which\r\ndrives the slides may be easily detached when the engine requires\r\nto be stopped. The section of the boiler, grate, and flues, is\r\nrepresented at W U. The safety-valve _y_ is enclosed beneath a\r\npipe carried up beside the chimney, and is inaccessible to the\r\nengine-man; _h_ are the cocks for blowing the salted water from\r\nthe boiler; and I I the feed-pipe.\r\n\r\nThe general arrangement of the engine-room of a steam-vessel is\r\nrepresented in _fig._ 120.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the effect required to be produced by marine engines\r\ndoes not render either necessary or possible that great regularity\r\nof action which is indispensable in a steam-engine applied to the\r\npurposes of manufacture. The agitation of the surface of the sea\r\nwill cause the immersion of the paddle-wheels to be subject to\r\ngreat variation, and the resistance produced by the water to the\r\nengine will undergo a corresponding change. The governor,\r\ntherefore, and other parts of the apparatus, contrived for giving\r\nto the engine that great regularity required in manufactures, are\r\nomitted in nautical engines, and nothing is introduced save what\r\nis [Pg447] necessary to maintain the machine in its full working\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 120.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 121.]\r\n\r\nTo save space, marine boilers are constructed so as to produce the\r\nnecessary quantity of steam within the smallest possible\r\ndimensions. With this view a more extensive surface in proportion\r\nto the capacity of the boiler is exposed to the action of the\r\nfire. The flues, by which the flame and heated air are conducted\r\nto the chimney, are so constructed that the heat may act upon the\r\nwater on every side in thin oblong shells or plates. This is\r\naccomplished by constructing the flues so as to traverse the\r\nboiler backwards and forwards several times before they terminate\r\n[Pg448] in the chimney. Such an arrangement renders the expense of\r\nthe boilers greater, but their steam-producing power is\r\nproportionally augmented, and experiments made by Mr. Watt, at\r\nBirmingham, have proved that such boilers with the same\r\nconsumption of fuel will produce, as compared with common land\r\nboilers, an increased evaporation in the proportion of about three\r\nto two.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 122.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 123.]\r\n\r\nThe form and arrangement of the water-spaces and flues in marine\r\nboilers may be collected from the sections of the boilers used in\r\nsome of the government steamers, exhibited in _figs._ 121, 122,\r\n123. A section made by a horizontal plane passing through the\r\nflues is exhibited in _fig._ 121. The furnaces F communicate in\r\npairs with the flues E, the air following the course through the\r\nflues represented by the arrows. The flue E passes to the back of\r\nthe boiler, then returns to the front, then to the back again, and\r\nis finally carried back to the front, where it communicates at C\r\nwith the curved flue B, represented in the transverse vertical\r\nsection, _fig._ 122. This curved flue B finally terminates in the\r\nchimney A. There are in this case three independent boilers, each\r\nworked by two furnaces communicating with the same system of\r\nflues; and in the curved flues B, _fig._ 122., by which the air is\r\nfinally conducted through the chimney, are placed three\r\nindependent [Pg449] dampers, by means of which the furnace of\r\neach boiler can be regulated independently of the other, and by\r\nwhich each boiler may be separately detached from communication\r\nwith the chimney. The letters of reference in the horizontal\r\nsection, _fig._ 121., correspond with those in the transverse\r\nvertical section, _fig._ 122., E representing the commencement of\r\nthe flues, and C their termination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 124.]\r\n\r\nA longitudinal section of the boiler made by a vertical plane\r\nextending from the front to the back is given in _fig._ 123.,\r\nwhere F, as before, is the furnace, G the grate-bars sloping\r\ndownwards from the front to the back, H the fire-bridge, C the\r\ncommencement of the flues, and A the chimney. An elevation of the\r\nfront of the boiler is represented in _fig._ 124., showing two of\r\nthe fire-doors closed, and the other two removed, displaying the\r\nposition of the grate-bars in front. Small openings are also\r\nprovided, closed by proper doors, by which access can be had to\r\nthe under side of the flues between the foundation timbers of the\r\nengine for the purpose of cleaning them.\r\n\r\nEach of these boilers can be worked independently of the others.\r\nBy this means, when at sea, the engine may be worked by any two of\r\nthe three boilers, while the third is being cleaned and put in\r\norder. In all sea-going steamers multiple boilers are at present\r\nprovided for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the boilers here represented the flues are all upon the same\r\nlevel, winding backwards and forwards without passing one above\r\nthe other. In other boilers, however, the flues, [Pg450] after\r\npassing backwards and forwards near the bottom of the boiler, turn\r\nupwards and pass backwards and forwards through a level of the\r\nwater nearer its surface, finally terminating in the chimney. More\r\nheating surface is thus obtained with the same capacity of boiler.\r\n\r\nThe most formidable difficulty which has been encountered in the\r\napplication of the steam-engine to sea-voyages has arisen from the\r\nnecessity of supplying the boiler with sea-water instead of pure\r\nfresh water. The sea-water is injected into the condenser for the\r\npurpose of condensing the steam, and it is thence, mixed with the\r\ncondensed steam, conducted as feeding water into the boiler.\r\n\r\n\r\n(209.) Sea-water holds, as is well known, certain alkaline\r\nsubstances in solution, the principal of which is muriate of soda,\r\nor common salt. Ten thousand grains of pure sea-water contain two\r\nhundred and twenty grains of common salt, the remaining\r\ningredients being thirty-three grains of sulphate of soda,\r\nforty-two grains of muriate of magnesia, and eight grains of\r\nmuriate of lime. The heat which converts pure water into steam\r\ndoes not at the same time evaporate those salts which the water\r\nholds in solution. As a consequence it follows, that as the\r\nevaporation in the boiler is continued, the salt, which was held\r\nin solution by the water which has been evaporated, remains in the\r\nboiler, and enters into solution with the water remaining in it.\r\nThe quantity of salt contained in sea-water being considerably\r\nless than that which water is capable of holding in solution, the\r\nprocess of evaporation for some time is attended with no other\r\neffect than to render the water in the boiler a stronger solution\r\nof salt. If, however, this process be continued, the quantity of\r\nsalt retained in the boiler having constantly an increasing\r\nproportion to the quantity of water, it must at length render the\r\nwater in the boiler a saturated solution—that is, a solution\r\ncontaining as much salt as at the actual temperature it is capable\r\nof holding in solution. If, therefore, the evaporation be\r\ncontinued beyond this point, the salt disengaged from the water\r\nevaporated instead of entering into solution with the water\r\nremaining in the boiler will be precipitated in the form of\r\nsediment; and if the process be continued in the [Pg451] same\r\nmanner, the boiler would at length become a mere salt-pan.\r\n\r\nBut besides the deposition of salt sediment in a loose form, some\r\nof the constituents of sea-water having an attraction for the iron\r\nof the boiler, collect upon it in a scale or crust in the same\r\nmanner as earthy matters held in solution by spring-water are\r\nobserved to form and become incrusted on the inner surface of\r\nland-boilers and of common culinary vessels.\r\n\r\nThe coating of the inner surface of a boiler by incrustation and\r\nthe collection of salt sediment in its lower parts, are attended\r\nwith effects highly injurious to the materials of the boiler. The\r\ncrust and sediment thus formed within the boiler are almost\r\nnon-conductors of heat, and placed, as they are, between the water\r\ncontained in the boiler and the metallic plates which form it,\r\nthey obstruct the passage of heat from the outer surface of the\r\nplates in contact with the fire to the water. The heat, therefore,\r\naccumulating in the boiler-plates so as to give them a much higher\r\ntemperature than the water within the boiler, has the effect of\r\nsoftening them, and by the unequal temperature which will thus be\r\nimparted to the lower plates which are incrusted, compared with\r\nthe higher parts which may not be so, an unequal expansion is\r\nproduced, by which the joints and seams of the boiler are loosened\r\nand opened, and leaks produced.\r\n\r\nThese injurious effects can only be prevented by either of two\r\nmethods; first, by so regulating the feed of the boiler that the\r\nwater it contains shall not be suffered to reach the point of\r\nsaturation, but shall be so limited in its degree of saltness that\r\nno injurious incrustation or deposit shall be formed; secondly, by\r\nthe adoption of some method by which the boiler may be worked with\r\nfresh water. This end can only be attained by condensing the steam\r\nby a jet of fresh water, and working the boiler continually by the\r\nsame water, since a supply of fresh water sufficient for a boiler\r\nworked in the ordinary way could never be commanded at sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n(210.) The method by which the saltness of the water in the boiler\r\nis most commonly prevented from exceeding a certain [Pg452] limit\r\nhas been to discharge from the boiler into the sea a certain\r\nquantity of over-salted water, and to supply its place by\r\nsea-water introduced into the condenser through the injection-cock\r\nfor the purpose of condensing the steam, this water being mixed\r\nwith the steam so condensed, and being, therefore, a weaker\r\nsolution of salt than common sea-water. To effect this, cocks\r\ncalled _blow-off cocks_, are usually placed in the lower parts of\r\nthe boiler, where the over-salted, and therefore heavier, parts of\r\nthe water collect. The pressure of the steam and incumbent weight\r\nof the water in the boiler force the lower strata of water out\r\nthrough these cocks; and this process, called _blowing out_, is,\r\nor ought to be, practised at such intervals as will prevent the\r\nwater from becoming over salted. When the salted water has been\r\nblown out in this manner, the level of the water in the boiler is\r\nrestored by a feed of corresponding quantity.\r\n\r\nThis process of blowing out, on the due and regular observance of\r\nwhich the preservation and efficiency of the boiler mainly depend,\r\nis too often left at the discretion of the engineer, who is, in most\r\ncases, not even supplied with the proper means of ascertaining the\r\nextent to which the process should be carried. It is commonly\r\nrequired that the engineer should blow out a certain portion of the\r\nwater in the boiler every two hours, restoring the level by a feed\r\nof equivalent amount; but it is evident that the sufficiency of the\r\nprocess founded on such a rule must mainly depend on the supposition\r\nthat the evaporation proceeds always at the same rate, which is far\r\nfrom being the case with marine boilers. An indicator, by which the\r\nsaltness of the water in the boiler would always be exhibited, ought\r\nto be provided, and the process of blowing out should be regulated\r\nby the indications of that instrument. To blow out more frequently\r\nthan is necessary is attended with a waste of fuel; for hot water is\r\nthus discharged into the sea while cold water is introduced in its\r\nplace, and consequently all the heat necessary to produce the\r\ndifference of the temperatures of the water blown out and the feed\r\nintroduced is lost. If, on the other hand, the process of blowing\r\nout be observed less frequently than is necessary, then more or less\r\nincrustation and deposit [Pg453] may be produced, and the injurious\r\neffects already described ensue.\r\n\r\nAs the specific gravity of water holding salt in solution is\r\nincreased with every increase of the strength of the solution, any\r\nform of hydrometer capable of exhibiting a visible indication of\r\nthe specific gravity of the water contained in the boiler would\r\nserve the purpose of an indicator, to show when the process of\r\nblowing out is necessary, and when it has been carried to a\r\nsufficient extent. The application of such instruments, however,\r\nwould be attended with some practical difficulties in the case of\r\nsea-boilers.\r\n\r\nThe temperature at which a solution of salt boils under a given\r\npressure varies considerably with the strength of the solution;\r\nthe more concentrated the solution is, the higher will be its\r\nboiling temperature under the same pressure. A comparison,\r\ntherefore, of a steam-gauge attached to the boiler, and a\r\nthermometer immersed in it, showing the pressure and the\r\ntemperature, would always indicate the saltness of the water; and\r\nit would not be difficult so to graduate these instruments as to\r\nmake them at once show the degree of saltness.\r\n\r\nIf the application of the thermometer be considered to be attended\r\nwith practical difficulty, the difference of pressures under which\r\nthe salt water of the boiler and fresh water of the same\r\ntemperature boil, might be taken as an indication of the saltness\r\nof the water in the boiler, and it would not be difficult to\r\nconstruct upon this principle a self-registering instrument, which\r\nwould not only indicate but record from hour to hour the degree of\r\nsaltness of the water. A small vessel of distilled water being\r\nimmersed in the water of the boiler would always have the\r\ntemperature of that water, and the steam produced from it\r\ncommunicating with a steam-gauge, the pressure of such steam would\r\nbe indicated by that gauge, while the pressure of the steam in the\r\nboiler under which pressure the salted water boils might be\r\nindicated by another gauge. The difference of the pressures\r\nindicated by the two gauges would thus become a test by which the\r\nsaltness of the water in the boiler would be measured. The two\r\npressures might be made to act on opposite ends of the same column\r\nof [Pg454] mercury contained in a siphon tube, and the difference\r\nof the levels of the two surfaces of the mercury would thus become\r\na measure of the saltness of the water in the boiler. A\r\nself-registering instrument founded on this principle formed part\r\nof the self-registering steam-log which I proposed to introduce\r\ninto steam-vessels some time since.\r\n\r\n\r\n(211.) The Messrs. Seaward of Limehouse have adopted, in some of\r\ntheir recently constructed engines, a method of indicating the\r\nsaltness of the water, and of measuring the quantity of salted\r\nwater or brine discharged, by blowing out. A glass-gauge, similar\r\nin form to that already described in land engines (156.), is\r\nprovided to indicate the position of the surface of the water in\r\nthe boiler. In this gauge two hydrometer balls are provided, the\r\nweight of which in proportion to their magnitude is such that they\r\nwould both sink to the bottom in a solution of salt of the same\r\nstrength as common sea-water. When the quantity of salt exceeds\r\n5/32 parts of the whole weight of the water, the lighter of the\r\ntwo balls will float to the top; and when the strength is further\r\nincreased until the proportion of salt exceeds 6/32 parts of the\r\nwhole, then the heavier ball will float to the top. The actual\r\nquantity of salt held in solution by sea-water in its ordinary\r\nstate is 1/32 part of its whole weight; and when by evaporation\r\nthe proportion of salt in solution has become 9/32 parts of the\r\nwhole, then a deposition of salt commences. With an indicator such\r\nas that above described, the ascent of the lighter hydrometer ball\r\ngives notice of the necessity for blowing out, and the ascent of\r\nthe heavier may be considered as indicating the approach of an\r\ninjurious state of saltness in the boiler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 125.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary method of blowing out the salted water from a boiler\r\nis by a pipe having a cock in it leading from the boiler through\r\nthe bottom of the ship, or at a point low down at its side.\r\nWhenever the engineer considers that the water in the boiler has\r\nbecome so salted that the process of blowing out should commence,\r\nhe opens the cock communicating by this pipe with the sea, and\r\nsuffers an indefinite and uncertain quantity of water to escape.\r\nIn this way he discharges, according to the magnitude of the\r\nboiler, from two to six tons [Pg455] of water, and repeats this\r\nat intervals of from two to four hours, as he may consider to be\r\nsufficient. If, by observing this process, he prevents the boiler\r\nfrom getting incrusted during the voyage, he considers his duty to\r\nbe effectually discharged, forgetting that he may have blown out\r\nmany times more water than is necessary for the preservation of\r\nthe boiler, and thereby produced a corresponding and unnecessary\r\nwaste of fuel. In order to limit the quantity of water discharged,\r\nMessrs. Seaward have adopted the following method. In _fig._ 125.\r\nis represented a transverse section of a part of a steam-vessel; W\r\nis the water-line of the boiler, B is the mouth of a blow-off\r\npipe, placed near the bottom of the boiler. This pipe rises to A,\r\nand turning in the horizontal direction, A C is conducted to a\r\ntank T, which contains exactly a ton of water. This pipe\r\ncommunicates with the tank by a cock D, governed by a lever H.\r\nWhen this lever is moved to D′, the cock D is open, and when it is\r\nmoved to K, the cock D is closed. From the same tank there\r\nproceeds another pipe E, which issues from the side of the\r\n[Pg456] vessel into the sea governed by a cock F, which is\r\nlikewise put in connection with the lever H, so that it shall be\r\nopened when the lever H is drawn to the position F′, the cock D′\r\nbeing closed in all positions of the lever between K and F′. Thus,\r\nwhenever the cock F communicating with the sea is open, the cock D\r\ncommunicating with the boiler is closed, and _vice versâ_, both\r\ncocks being closed when the lever is in the intermediate position\r\nK. By this arrangement the boiler cannot, by any neglect in\r\nblowing off, be left in communication with the sea, nor can more\r\nthan a ton of water be discharged except by the immediate act of\r\nthe engineer. The injurious consequences are thus prevented which\r\nsometimes ensue when the blow-off cocks are left open by any\r\nneglect on the part of the engineer. When it is necessary to blow\r\noff, the engineer moves the lever H, to the position D′. The\r\npressure of the steam in the boiler on the surface of the water W\r\nforces the salted water or brine up the pipe B A, and through the\r\nopen cock C into the tank, and this continues until the tank is\r\nfilled: when that takes place, the lever is moved from the\r\nposition D′ to the position F′, by which the cock D is closed, and\r\nthe cock F opened. The water in the tank flows through the pipe E\r\ninto the sea, air being admitted through the valve V, placed at\r\nthe top of the tank, opening inwards. A second ton of brine is\r\ndischarged by moving the lever back to the position D′, and\r\nsubsequently returning it to the position F′; and in this way the\r\nbrine is discharged ton by ton, until the supply of water from the\r\nfeed which replaces it has caused both the balls in the indicator\r\nto sink to the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\n(212.) A different method of preserving the requisite freshness of\r\nthe water in the boiler has been adopted by Messrs. Maudslay and\r\nField, and introduced with success into the Great Western and\r\nother steam-vessels. Pumps called _brine-pumps_ are put into\r\ncommunication with the lower part of the boiler, and so\r\nconstructed as to draw the brine therefrom, and drive it into the\r\nsea. These brine-pumps are worked by the engine, and their\r\noperation is constant. The feed-pumps are likewise worked by the\r\nengine, and they bear such a proportion to the brine-pumps that\r\nthe quantity of salt discharged in a given time in the brine is\r\nequal to the quantity of salt [Pg457] introduced in solution by\r\nthe water of the feed-pumps. By this means the same actual\r\nquantity of salt is constantly maintained in the boiler, and\r\nconsequently the strength of the solution remains invariable. If\r\nthe brine discharged by the brine-pumps contains 5/32 parts of\r\nsalt while the water introduced by the feed-pumps contains only\r\n1/32 part, then it is evident that five cubic feet of the feeding\r\nwater will contain no more salt than is contained in one cubic\r\nfoot of brine. Under such circumstances the brine-pumps would be\r\nso constructed as to discharge 1/5 of the water introduced by the\r\nfeed-pumps, so that 4/5 of all the water introduced into the\r\nboiler would be evaporated, and rendered available for working the\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nTo save the heat of the brine, a method has been adopted in the\r\nmarine engines constructed by Messrs. Maudslay and Field similar\r\nto one which has been long practised in steam-boilers, and in\r\nvarious apparatus for the warming of buildings. The current of\r\nheated brine is conducted from the boiler through a tube which is\r\ncontained in another, through which the feed is introduced. The\r\nwarm current of brine, therefore, as it passes out, imparts a\r\nconsiderable portion of its heat to the cold feed which comes in;\r\nand it is found that by this expedient the brine discharged into\r\nthe sea may be reduced to a temperature of about 100°.\r\n\r\nThis expedient is so effectual that when the apparatus is properly\r\nconstructed, and kept in a state of efficiency, it may be regarded\r\nas nearly a perfect preventive against the incrustation, and the\r\ndeposition of salt in the boilers, and is not attended with any\r\nconsiderable waste of fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\n(213.) About the year 1776, Mr. Watt invented a tubular condenser,\r\nwith a view to condense the steam drawn off from the cylinder\r\nwithout the process of injection. This apparatus consisted of a\r\nnumber of small tubes connecting the top and bottom of the\r\ncondenser, arranged in a manner not very different from that of\r\nthe tubes which traverse the boiler of a locomotive engine. These\r\ntubes were continually surrounded by cold water, and the steam, as\r\nit escaped from the cylinder passing through them, was condensed\r\nby their cold surfaces, and collected in the form of water in a\r\nreservoir below, from [Pg458] whence it was drawn off by a pump\r\nin the same manner as in engines which condensed by injection. One\r\nof the advantages proposed by this expedient was, that no\r\natmospheric air would be introduced into the condenser, as is\r\nalways the case when condensation by injection is practised. Cold\r\nwater, which is injected, has always combined with it more or less\r\ncommon air. When this water is mixed with the condensed steam, the\r\nelevation of its temperature disengages the air combined with it,\r\nand this air circulating to the cylinder, vitiates the vacuum. One\r\nof the purposes for which the air-pump in condensing steam-engines\r\nwas provided, and from which it took its name, was to draw off\r\nthis air. If, however, a tubular condenser could be made to act\r\nwith the necessary efficiency, no injection water would be\r\nintroduced for condensation, and the pump would have no other duty\r\nexcept to remove the small quantity of water produced by the\r\ncondensed steam. That water being subsequently carried back to the\r\nboiler by the feed-pumps, a constant system of circulation would\r\nbe maintained, and the boiler would never require any fresh supply\r\nof water, except what might be necessary to make good the waste by\r\nleakage and other causes.\r\n\r\nThis contrivance has been of late years revived by Mr. Samuel Hall\r\nof Basford, near Nottingham, with a view to supersede in marine\r\nengines the necessity of using sea-water in the boilers. Mr. Hall\r\nproposes to make marine boilers with fresh water to condense the\r\nsteam without injection, by a tubulated condenser, and to provide\r\nby the distillation of sea-water the small quantity of fresh water\r\nwhich would be necessary to make good the waste. These condensers\r\nhave been introduced into several steam-vessels: in some they have\r\nbeen continued, and in others abandoned, and various opinions are\r\nentertained of their efficacy. I have not been able to obtain the\r\nresults of any satisfactory experiments on them, and cannot\r\ntherefore form a judgment of their usefulness. Mr. Watt abandoned\r\nthese condensers from finding that the condensation of the steam\r\nwas not sufficiently sudden, and that consequently at the\r\ncommencement of the stroke the piston was subject to a resistance\r\nwhich [Pg459] injuriously diminished the amount of the moving\r\npower, whereas condensation by jet was almost instantaneous, and\r\nthe efficiency of the piston throughout the entire stroke was more\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nMr. Watt also found that a fur collected around the tubes of the\r\ncondenser, so as to obstruct the free passage of heat from the\r\nsteam to the water of the cold cistern; and that, consequently,\r\nthe efficiency of the condenser was gradually impaired, and could\r\nonly be restored by frequent cleansing.\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Mr. Hall that a vacuum is preserved in his\r\ncondensers as perfect as that which is maintained in the ordinary\r\ncondensers by injection. It is objected, on the other hand, that\r\nwithout the injection water and the air which accompanies it being\r\nintroduced into his condensers, Mr. Hall uses as large and\r\npowerful an air-pump as those which are used in engines of equal\r\npower condensing by injection; that, consequently, the vacuum\r\nwhich is maintained is produced, not as it ought to be altogether\r\nby the condensation of steam, but by the air-pump drawing off the\r\nuncondensed steam. To whatever extent this may be true, the\r\nefficacy of the machine, as indicated by the barometer-gauge, is\r\nonly apparent; since as much power is necessary to pump away any\r\nportion of uncondensed vapour as is obtained by the vacuum\r\nproduced by the absence of that vapour.\r\n\r\nA tubular condenser of the form proposed by Mr. Hall is represented\r\nin _fig._ 126.; _a_ is the upper part of the condenser to which\r\nsteam is admitted from the slide after having worked the piston; _k_\r\nis the section of a thin plate, forming the top of the condenser,\r\nperforated with small holes, in which the tubes are inserted so as\r\nto be steam-tight and water-tight. Water is admitted to flow around\r\nthese tubes between the top _k_ and the bottom _d_ of the condenser,\r\nso as to keep them constantly at a low temperature. The steam passes\r\nfrom _a_ through the tubes to the lower chamber _f_ of the\r\ncondenser, where it is reduced to water by the cold to which it has\r\nbeen exposed. A supply of cold water is constantly pumped through\r\nthe condenser, so as to keep the tubes at a low temperature. The\r\nair-pump _g_ is of the usual construction, having valves in the\r\npiston opening upwards, and [Pg460] similar valves in the cover of\r\nthe pump also opening upwards. The water formed by the condensed\r\nsteam in _f_ is drawn through the foot-valve, and after passing\r\nthrough the piston-valves, is discharged by the up-stroke of the\r\npiston into the hot well. Any air, or other permanent gas, which may\r\nbe admitted by leakage through the tubes of the condenser, or by any\r\nother means, is likewise drawn out by this pump, and when drawn into\r\nthe hot well is carried from thence to the feeding apparatus of the\r\nboiler, to which it is transferred by the feed-pump.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 126.]\r\n\r\nA provision is likewise made by which the steam escaping at the\r\nsafety-valve is condensed and carried away to the feeding cistern.\r\n\r\n\r\n(214.) One of the remedies proposed for the evil consequences\r\narising from incrustation is the substitution of copper for iron\r\nboilers. The attraction which produces the adhesion of the\r\ncalcareous matter held in solution by salt water to the surface of\r\niron has no existence in copper, and all the saline and other\r\nalkaline matter precipitated in the boiling water in [Pg461]\r\ncopper boilers is suspended in a loose form, and carried off by\r\nthe process of blowing out.\r\n\r\nBesides the injury arising from the deposition of salt and the\r\nincrustation on the inner surface of boilers, an evil of a\r\nformidable kind attends the accumulation of soot mixed with salt\r\nin the flues, which proceeds from the leaks. In the seams of the\r\nboiler there are numerous apertures, of dimensions so small as to\r\nbe incapable of being rendered stanch by any practicable means,\r\nthrough which the water within the boiler filters, and the salt\r\nwhich it carries with it mixes with the soot, forming a compound\r\nwhich rapidly corrodes the boilers. This process of corrosion in\r\nthe flues takes place not less in copper than in iron boilers. In\r\ncleansing the flues of a copper boiler, the salt and soot which\r\nwas thrown out upon the iron-plates which formed the flooring of\r\nthe engine-room, having remained there for some time, left behind\r\nit a permanent appearance of copper on the iron flooring, arising\r\nfrom the precipitation of the copper which had combined with the\r\nsoot and salt in the flues.[36] In this case the leaks from whence\r\nthe salt proceeded were found, on careful examination, so\r\nunimportant, that the usual means to stanch them could not be\r\nresorted to without the risk of increasing the evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n(215.) In the application of the steam-engine to the propulsion of\r\nvessels in voyages of great extent, the economy of fuel acquires\r\nan importance greater than that which appertains to it in\r\nland-engines, even in localities the most removed from coal-mines,\r\nand where its expense is greatest. The practical limit to\r\nsteam-voyages being determined by the greatest quantity of coals\r\nwhich a steam-vessel can carry, every expedient by which the\r\nefficiency of the fuel can be increased becomes a means, not\r\nmerely of a saving of expense, but of an increased extension of\r\nsteam-power to navigation. Much attention has been bestowed on the\r\naugmentation of the duty of engines in the mining districts of\r\nCornwall, where the question of their efficiency is merely a\r\nquestion of economy, but far greater care should be given to this\r\nsubject when the practicability of maintaining intercourse by\r\nsteam between distant points of the globe will perhaps depend on\r\nthe effect produced by a given quantity [Pg462] of fuel. So long\r\nas steam-navigation was confined to river and channel transport,\r\nand to coasting voyages, the speed of the vessel was a paramount\r\nconsideration, at whatever expenditure of fuel it might be\r\nobtained; but since steam-navigation has been extended to\r\nocean-voyages, where coals must be transported sufficient to keep\r\nthe engine in operation for a long period of time without a fresh\r\nrelay, greater attention has been bestowed upon the means of\r\neconomising it.\r\n\r\nMuch of the efficiency of fuel must depend on the management of\r\nthe fires, and therefore on the skill and care of the stokers.\r\nFormerly the efficiency of firemen was determined by the abundant\r\nproduction of steam, and so long as the steam was evolved in\r\nsuperabundance, however it might have blown off to waste, the duty\r\nof the stoker was considered as well performed. The regulation of\r\nthe fires according to the demands of the engine were not thought\r\nof, and whether much or little steam was wanted, the duty of the\r\nstoker was to urge the fires to their extreme limit.\r\n\r\nSince the resistance opposed by the action of the paddle-wheels of\r\na steam-vessel varies with the state of the weather, the\r\nconsumption of steam in the cylinders must undergo a corresponding\r\nvariation; and if the production of steam in the boilers be not\r\nproportioned to this, the engines will either work with less\r\nefficiency than they might do under the actual circumstances of\r\nthe weather, or more steam will be produced in the boilers than\r\nthe cylinders can consume, and the surplus will be discharged to\r\nwaste through the safety-valves. The stokers of a marine engine,\r\ntherefore, to perform their duty with efficiency, and obtain from\r\nthe fuel the greatest possible effect, must discharge the\r\nfunctions of a self-regulating furnace, such as has been already\r\ndescribed: they must regulate the force of the fires by the amount\r\nof steam which the cylinders are capable of consuming, and they\r\nmust take care that no unconsumed fuel is allowed to be carried\r\naway from the ash-pit.\r\n\r\n\r\n(216.) Until within a few years of the present time the heat\r\nradiated from every part of the surface of the boiler was allowed\r\nto go to waste, and to produce injurious effects on those parts of\r\nthe vessel to which it was transmitted. This evil, [Pg463]\r\nhowever, has been lately removed by coating the boilers,\r\nsteam-pipes, &c. of steam-vessels with felt, by which the escape\r\nof heat from the surface of the boiler is very nearly, if not\r\naltogether, prevented. This felt is attached to the boiler-surface\r\nby a thick covering of white and red lead. This expedient was\r\nfirst applied in the year 1818 to a private steam-vessel of Mr.\r\nWatt's called the _Caledonia_, and it was subsequently adopted in\r\nanother vessel, the machinery of which was constructed at Soho,\r\ncalled the _James Watt_.\r\n\r\nThe economy of fuel depends in a considerable degree on the\r\narrangement of the furnaces, and the method of feeding them. In\r\ngeneral each boiler is worked by two or more furnaces communicating\r\nwith the same system of flues. While the furnace is fed, the door\r\nbeing open, a stream of cold air rushes in, passing over the burning\r\nfuel and lowering the temperature of the flues: this is an evil to\r\nbe avoided. But, on the other hand, if the furnaces be fed at\r\ndistant intervals, then each furnace will be unduly heaped with\r\nfuel, a great quantity of smoke will be evolved, and the combustion\r\nof the fuel will be proportionally imperfect. The process of coking\r\nin front of the grate, which would insure a complete combustion of\r\nthe fuel, has been already described (147.). A frequent supply of\r\ncoals, however, laid carefully on the front part of the grate, and\r\ngradually pushed backwards as each fresh feed is introduced, would\r\nrequire the fire-door to be frequently opened, and cold air to be\r\nadmitted. It would also require greater vigilance on the part of the\r\nstokers than can generally be obtained in the circumstances in which\r\nthey work. In steam-vessels the furnaces are therefore fed less\r\nfrequently, fuel introduced in greater quantities, and a less\r\nperfect combustion produced.\r\n\r\nWhen several furnaces are constructed under the same boiler,\r\ncommunicating with the same system of flues, the process of\r\nfeeding, and consequently opening one of them, obstructs the due\r\noperation of the others, for the current of cold air which is thus\r\nadmitted into the flues checks the draft and diminishes the\r\nefficiency of the furnaces in operation. It was formerly the\r\npractice in vessels exceeding one hundred horse-power, to place\r\nfour furnaces under each boiler, communicating with the same\r\nsystem of flues. Such an arrangement [Pg464] was found to be\r\nattended with a bad draft in the furnaces, and therefore to\r\nrequire a greater quantity of heating surface to produce the\r\nnecessary evaporation. This entailed upon the machinery the\r\noccupation of more space in the vessel in proportion to its power;\r\nit has therefore been more recently the practice to give a\r\nseparate system of flues to each pair of furnaces, or, at most, to\r\nevery three furnaces. When three furnaces communicate with a\r\ncommon flue, two will always be in operation, while the third is\r\nbeing cleared out; but if the same quantity of fire were divided\r\namong two furnaces, then the clearing out of one would throw out\r\nof operation half the entire quantity of fire, and during the\r\nprocess the evaporation would be injuriously diminished. It is\r\nfound by experience, that the side plates of furnaces are liable\r\nto more rapid destruction than their roofs, owing, probably, to a\r\ngreater liability to deposit. Furnaces, therefore, should not be\r\nmade narrower than a certain limit. Great depth from front to back\r\nis also attended with practical inconvenience, as it renders\r\nfiring tools of considerable length, and a corresponding extent of\r\nstoking room necessary. It is recommended, by those who have had\r\nmuch practical experience in steam-vessels, that furnaces six feet\r\nin depth from front to back should not be less than three feet in\r\nwidth, to afford means of firing with as little injury to the side\r\nplates as possible, and of keeping the fires in the condition\r\nnecessary for the production of the greatest effect. The tops of\r\nthe furnaces almost never decay, and seldom are subject to an\r\nalteration of figure, unless the level of the water be allowed to\r\nfall below them.[37]\r\n\r\n\r\n(217.) A form of marine engine was some years since proposed and\r\npatented by Mr. Thomas Howard, possessing much novelty and\r\ningenuity, and having pretensions to a very extraordinary economy\r\nof fuel, in addition to the advantages claimed by Mr. Hall. In Mr.\r\nHoward's engines, the steam, as in Mr. Hall's, is constantly\r\nreproduced from the same water, so that pure or distilled water\r\nmay be used; but Mr. Howard dispenses altogether with the use of a\r\nboiler.\r\n\r\nA quantity of mercury is placed in a shallow wrought-iron\r\nvessel over a coke fire, by which it is maintained at a [Pg465]\r\ntemperature varying from 400° to 500°. The surface exposed to the\r\nfire was computed at three fourths of a square foot for each\r\nhorse-power. The upper surface of the mercury was covered by a\r\nvery thin plate of iron in contact with it, and so contrived as to\r\npresent about four times as much surface as that exposed beneath\r\nthe fire. Adjacent to this a vessel of water was placed,\r\nmaintained nearly at the boiling point, and communicating by a\r\nnozzle and valve with the chamber immediately above the mercury.\r\nAt intervals corresponding to the motion of the piston a small\r\nquantity of water was injected from this vessel, and thrown upon\r\nthe plate of iron resting upon the hot mercury. From this it\r\nreceived not only the heat necessary to convert it into common\r\nsteam, but to give it the qualities of highly superheated steam.\r\nIn fact, the steam thus produced had a temperature considerably\r\nabove that which corresponded to its pressure, and was, therefore,\r\ncapable of being deprived of more or less of its heat without\r\nbeing condensed. (94.) The quantity of water injected into the\r\nsteam-chamber was regulated by the power at which the engine was\r\nintended to be worked. The fire was supplied with air by a blower\r\nsubject to exact regulation. The steam thus produced was conducted\r\nto a chamber surrounding the working cylinder, and this chamber\r\nitself was enclosed by another space through which the air from\r\nthe furnace passed before it reached the flue. By this contrivance\r\nthe air imparted its redundant heat to the steam, as the latter\r\npassed to the cylinder, and raised its temperature to about 400°,\r\nthe pressure, however, not exceeding 25 lbs. per square inch. The\r\nvalves, governing the admission of steam to the piston, were\r\nadapted for expansive action.\r\n\r\nThe vacuum on the opposite side was maintained by condensation in\r\nthe following manner:—The condenser was a copper vessel placed in\r\na cistern of cold water, and the steam was admitted to it from the\r\ncylinder by an eduction pipe in the usual way. A jet was\r\nintroduced from an adjacent vessel filled with distilled water,\r\nand the condensing water and condensed steam were pumped from the\r\ncondenser as in common engines. The warm water thus pumped out of\r\nthe [Pg466] condenser was drawn through a copper worm, carried\r\nwith many coils through a cistern of cold water, so that when it\r\narrived at the end of this pipe it was reduced nearly to the\r\ntemperature of the atmosphere. The pipe was thus brought to the\r\nvessel of distilled water already mentioned, and the water\r\nsupplied by it replaced. The water admitted to the condenser\r\nthrough the condensing jet being purged of air, a small air-pump\r\nwas sufficient, since it had only to exhaust the condenser and\r\ntubes at starting, and to remove the air which might be admitted\r\nby leakage. Mr. Howard stated that the condensation took place as\r\nrapidly and perfectly as in the best engines of the common kind.\r\n\r\nAn engine of this construction was in the spring of 1835 placed in\r\nthe government steamer called the _Comet_. It was stated, that\r\nthough the machinery was not advantageously constructed, a part of\r\nthe engine being old, and not made expressly for a boiler of this\r\nkind, the vessel performed a voyage from Falmouth to Lisbon, in\r\nwhich the consumption of fuel did not exceed a third of her former\r\nconsumption when worked by Boulton and Watt's engines, the former\r\nconsumption of coals being about eight hundred pounds per hour,\r\nand the consumption of Mr. Howard's engine being less than two\r\nhundred and fifty pounds of coke per hour.\r\n\r\nThe advantages claimed for this contrivance were the following:\r\n_first_, the small space and weight occupied by the machinery,\r\narising from the absence of a boiler; _second_, the diminished\r\nconsumption of fuel; _third_, the reduced size of the flues;\r\n_fourth_, the removal of the injurious effects arising from\r\ndeposit and incrustation; _fifth_, the absence of smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n(218.) The method by which the greatest quantity of practical effect\r\ncan be obtained from a given quantity of fuel must, however, mainly\r\ndepend on the extended application of the expansive principle. This\r\nhas been the means by which an extraordinary amount of duty has been\r\nobtained from the Cornish engines. The difficulty of the application\r\nof this principle in marine engines has arisen from the objections\r\nentertained in Europe to the use of steam of high pressure under the\r\ncircumstances in which the engine must be worked at sea. To apply\r\nthe expansive principle, it is necessary that the moving power at\r\nthe commencement of the stroke shall considerably exceed the\r\n[Pg467] resistance, its force being gradually attenuated till the\r\ncompletion of the stroke, when it will at length become less than\r\nthe resistance. This condition may, however, be attained with steam\r\nof limited pressure, if the engine be constructed with a sufficient\r\nquantity of piston-surface. This method of rendering the expansive\r\nprinciple available at sea, and compatible with low-pressure steam,\r\nhas recently been brought into operation by Messrs. Maudslay and\r\nField. Their improvement consists in adapting two steam-cylinders in\r\none engine, in such a manner that the steam shall act simultaneously\r\non both pistons, causing them to ascend and descend together. The\r\npiston-rods are both attached to the same horizontal cross-head,\r\nwhereby their combined action is applied to one crank by means of a\r\nconnecting rod placed between the pistons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 127.]\r\n\r\nA section of such an engine, made by a plane passing through the\r\ntwo piston-rods P P′ and cylinders, is represented in _fig._ 127.\r\nThe piston-rods are attached to a cross-head C, [Pg468] which\r\nascends and descends with them. This cross-head drives upwards and\r\ndownwards an axle D, to which the lower end of the connecting rod\r\nE is attached. The other end of the connecting rod drives the\r\ncrank-pin F, and imparts revolution to the paddle-shaft G. A rod H\r\nconveys motion by means of a beam I to the rod K of the air-pump\r\nE.\r\n\r\n\r\n(219.) Connected with this, and in the same patent, another\r\nimprovement is included, consisting of the application of a hollow\r\nwrought-iron framing carried across the vessel above the machinery,\r\nto support the whole of the bearings of the crank-shaft. A plan of\r\nthis, including the cylinders and paddle-wheel, is represented in\r\n_fig._ 128. The advantages proposed by these improvements are\r\nsimplicity of construction, more direct action on the crank, economy\r\nof space and weight of material, combined with increased area of the\r\npiston, whereby a given evaporating power of the boiler is rendered\r\nproductive, by extended application of the expansive principle, of a\r\ngreater moving power than in former arrangements. Consequently,\r\nunder like circumstances, greater power and economy of fuel is\r\nobtained, with the further advantage at sea, that when the engine is\r\nreduced in its speed, either by the vessel being deeply laden with\r\ncoal, as is the case at the commencement of a long sea voyage, or by\r\nhead winds, more steam may be given to the cylinders, and\r\nconsequently more speed imparted to the vessel, all the steam\r\nproduced in the boiler being usefully employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n(220.) Another improvement, having the same objects, and analogous\r\nto the preceding, has been likewise patented by Messrs. Maudslay\r\nand Field. This consists in the adoption of a cylinder of greater\r\ndiameter, having two piston-rods P P′, as represented in _fig._\r\n129., of considerable length, connected at the top by a cross-head\r\nC. From this cross-head is carried downwards the connecting rod D,\r\nwhich drives the crank-pin E, and thereby works the paddle-shaft\r\nS. In this case the paddle-shaft is extended immediately above the\r\npiston, and the double piston-rod has sufficient length to be\r\nabove the paddle-shaft when the piston is at the bottom of its\r\nstroke. This improvement is intended to be applied more\r\nparticularly for engines for river navigation, the advantages\r\nresulting from [Pg469] it being that a paddle-shaft placed at a\r\ngiven height from the bottom of the vessel will be enabled to\r\nreceive a longer stroke of piston than by any other arrangement\r\nnow in use. A more [Pg470] compact and firm connection of the\r\ncylinder with the crank-shaft bearings is effected by it, and a\r\ncylinder of much greater diameter may be applied by which the\r\nexpansive action of steam may be more fully brought into play; and\r\na more direct action of the steam-power on the crank with a less\r\nweight of materials and a greater economy of space may be obtained\r\nthan by any of the arrangements of marine engines hitherto used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 128.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 129.]\r\n\r\n\r\n(221.) Mr. Francis Humphrys has obtained a patent for a form of\r\nmarine engine, by which some simplification of the machinery is\r\nattained, and the same power comprised within more limited\r\ndimensions. In this engine there is attached to the piston of the\r\ncylinder, instead of a piston-rod, a hollow casing D D (_fig._\r\n130.), which moves through a stuffing-box G, constructed in a\r\nmanner similar to the stuffing-box of a piston-rod. In the figure,\r\nthis casing is presented in section, but [Pg471] its form is that\r\nof a long narrow slit, or opening, rounded at either end as\r\nexhibited in the plan (_fig._ 131) of the cylinder-cover. The\r\ncrank C is driven by the other end of the connecting rod H, the\r\ncrank-shaft being immediately above the centre of the piston and\r\nthe connecting rod passing through the oblong opening D, and\r\ndescending into the hollow piston-rod it is attached to an axis I\r\nat the bottom of the piston. A box or cover K K encloses the\r\ncross-piece or axis I with its bearings, and is [Pg472] attached\r\nso as to be steam-tight to the bottom of the piston. A hollow\r\nspace L L is cast in the bottom of the cylinder for the reception\r\nof the box K K, when the piston is at the bottom of the cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 130.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 131.]\r\n\r\nBy this arrangement the force by which the piston is driven in its\r\nascent and descent is communicated to the connecting rod, not, as\r\nusual, through the intervention of a piston-rod, but directly from\r\nthe piston itself by the cross-pin I, and from thence to the crank\r\nC, which it drives without the intervention of beams, cross-heads,\r\nor any similar appendage.\r\n\r\nThe slide-valves regulating the admission and eduction of steam\r\nare represented at _a_; the rod of the air-pump is shown at _d_,\r\nbeing worked by a crank placed on the centre of the great crank\r\nshaft.[38]\r\n\r\n\r\n(222.) To obtain from the moving power its full amount of\r\nmechanical effect in propelling the vessel, it would be necessary\r\nthat its force should propel, by constantly acting against the\r\nwater in a horizontal direction, and with a motion contrary to the\r\ncourse of the vessel. No system of mechanical propellers has,\r\nhowever, yet been contrived capable of perfectly accomplishing\r\nthis. Patents have been granted for many ingenious mechanical\r\ncombinations to impart to the propelling surfaces such angles as\r\nappeared to the respective contrivers most advantageous. In most\r\nof these the mechanical complexity has formed a fatal objection.\r\nNo part of the machinery of a steam-vessel is so liable to become\r\nderanged at sea as the paddle-wheels; and, therefore, that\r\nsimplicity of construction which is compatible with those repairs\r\nwhich are possible on such emergencies is quite essential for safe\r\npractical use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 132.]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary paddle-wheel, as has been already stated, is a wheel\r\nrevolving upon a shaft driven by the engine, and carrying upon its\r\ncircumference a number of flat boards, called paddle-boards, which\r\nare secured by nuts and braces in a fixed position; and that\r\nposition is such that the planes [Pg473] of the paddle-boards\r\ndiverge nearly from the centre of the shaft on which the wheel\r\nturns. The consequence of this arrangement is that each\r\npaddle-board can only act in that direction which is most\r\nadvantageous for the propulsion of the vessel when it arrives near\r\nthe lowest point of the wheel. In _fig._ 132. let O be the shaft\r\non which the common paddle-wheel revolves; the position of the\r\npaddle-boards are represented at A, B, C, &c.; X, Y represents the\r\nwater line, the course of the vessel being supposed to be from X\r\nto Y; the arrows represent the direction in which the paddle-wheel\r\nrevolves. The wheel is immersed to the depth of the lowest\r\npaddle-board, since a less degree of immersion would render a\r\nportion of the surface of each paddle-board mechanically useless.\r\nIn the position A the whole force of the paddle-board is efficient\r\nfor propelling the vessel; but as the paddle enters the water in\r\nthe position H, its action upon the water, not being horizontal,\r\nis only partially effective for propulsion: a part of the force\r\nwhich drives the paddle is expended in depressing the water, and\r\nthe remainder in driving it contrary to the course of the vessel,\r\nand, therefore, by its re-action producing a certain propelling\r\neffect. The tendency, however, of the paddle entering the water at\r\nH, is to form a hollow or trough, which the water, by its ordinary\r\nproperty, has a continual tendency to fill up. After passing the\r\nlowest point A, as the paddle approaches the position B, where it\r\n[Pg474] emerges from the water, its action again becomes oblique,\r\na part only having a propelling effect, and the remainder having a\r\ntendency to raise the water, and throw up a wave and spray behind\r\nthe paddle-wheel. It is evident that the more deeply the\r\npaddle-wheel becomes immersed, the greater will be the proportion\r\nof the propelling power thus wasted in elevating and depressing\r\nthe water; and if the wheel were immersed to its axis, the whole\r\nforce of the paddle-boards, on entering and leaving the water,\r\nwould be lost, no part of it having a tendency to propel. If a\r\nstill deeper immersion take place, the paddle-boards above the\r\naxis would have a tendency to retard the course of the vessel.\r\nWhen the vessel is, therefore, in proper trim, the immersion\r\nshould not exceed nor fall short of the depth of the lowest\r\npaddle; but for various reasons it is impossible in practice to\r\nmaintain this fixed immersion: the agitation of the surface of the\r\nsea, causing the vessel to roll, will necessarily produce a great\r\nvariation in the immersion of the paddle-wheels, one becoming\r\nfrequently immersed to its axle, while the other is raised\r\naltogether out of the water. Also the draught of water of the\r\nvessel is liable to change, by the variation in her cargo; this\r\nwill necessarily happen in steamers which take long voyages. At\r\nstarting they are heavily laden with fuel, which as they proceed\r\nis gradually consumed, whereby the vessel is lightened.\r\n\r\n\r\n(223.) To remove this defect, and economise as much as possible\r\nthe propelling effect of the paddle-boards, it would be necessary\r\nso to construct them that they may enter and leave the water\r\nedgeways, or as nearly so as possible; such an arrangement would\r\nbe, in effect, equivalent to the process called feathering, as\r\napplied to oars. Any mechanism which would perfectly accomplish\r\nthis would cause the paddles to work in almost perfect silence,\r\nand would very nearly remove the inconvenient and injurious\r\nvibration which is produced by the action of the common paddles.\r\nBut the construction of feathering paddles is attended with great\r\ndifficulty, under the peculiar circumstances in which such wheels\r\nwork. Any mechanism so complex that it could not be easily\r\nrepaired when deranged, with such engineering implements and\r\nskill [Pg475] as can be obtained at sea, would be attended with\r\ngreat objections; and the efficiency of its propelling action\r\nwould not compensate for the dangers which must attend upon the\r\nhelpless state of a steamer, deprived of her propelling agents.\r\n\r\nFeathering paddle-boards must necessarily have a motion\r\nindependently of the motion of the wheel, since any fixed position\r\nwhich could be given to them, though it might be most favourable to\r\ntheir action in one position would not be so in their whole course\r\nthrough the water. Thus the paddle-board when at the lowest point\r\nshould be in a vertical position, or so placed that its plane, if\r\ncontinued upwards, would pass through the axis of the wheel. In\r\nother positions, however, as it passes through the water, it should\r\npresent its upper edge, not towards the axle of the wheel, but\r\ntowards a point above the highest point of the wheel. The precise\r\npoint to which the edge of the paddle-board should be directed is\r\ncapable of mathematical determination. But it will vary according to\r\ncircumstances, which depend on the motion of the vessel. The\r\nprogressive motion of the vessel, independently of the wind or\r\ncurrent, must obviously be slower than the motion of the\r\npaddle-boards round the axle of the wheel; since it is by the\r\ndifference of these velocities that the re-action of the water is\r\nproduced by which the vessel is propelled. The proportion, however,\r\nbetween the progressive speed of the vessel and the rotative speed\r\nof the paddle-boards is not fixed: it will vary with the shape and\r\nstructure of the vessel, and with its depth of immersion;\r\nnevertheless it is upon this proportion that the manner in which the\r\npaddle-boards should shift their position must be determined. If the\r\nprogressive speed of the vessel were nearly equal to the rotative\r\nspeed of the paddle-boards, the latter should so shift their\r\nposition that their upper edges should be presented to a point very\r\nlittle above the highest point of the wheel. This is a state of\r\nthings which could only take place in the case of a steamer of a\r\nsmall draught of water, shallop-shaped, and so constructed as to\r\nsuffer little resistance from the fluid. On the other hand, the\r\ngreater the depth of immersion, and the less fine the lines of the\r\n[Pg476] vessel, the greater will be the resistance in passing\r\nthrough the water, and the greater will be the proportion which the\r\nrotative speed of the paddle-boards will bear to the progressive\r\nspeed of the vessel. In this latter case the independent motion of\r\nthe paddle-boards should be such that their edges, while in the\r\nwater, shall be presented towards a point considerably above the\r\nhighest point of the paddle-wheel.\r\n\r\nA vast number of ingenious mechanical contrivances have been\r\ninvented and patented for accomplishing the object just explained.\r\nSome of these have failed from the circumstance of their inventors\r\nnot clearly understanding what precise motion it was necessary to\r\nimpart to the paddle-board: others have failed from the complexity\r\nof the mechanism by which the desired effect was produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n(224.) In the year 1829 a patent was granted to Elijah Galloway\r\nfor a paddle-wheel with movable paddles, which patent was\r\npurchased by Mr. William Morgan, who made various alterations in\r\nthe mechanism, not very materially departing from the principle of\r\nthe invention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 133.]\r\n\r\nThis paddle-wheel is represented in _fig._ 133. The contrivance\r\nmay be shortly stated to consist in causing the wheel which bears\r\nthe paddles to revolve on one centre, and the radial arms which\r\nmove the paddles to revolve on another centre. Let A B C D E F G H\r\nI K L be the polygonal circumference of the paddle-wheel, formed\r\nof straight bars, securely connected together at the extremities\r\nof the spokes or radii of the wheel which turns on the shaft which\r\nis worked by the engine; the centre of this wheel being at O. So\r\nfar this wheel is similar to the common paddle-wheel; but the\r\npaddle-boards are not, as in the common wheel, fixed at A B C,\r\n&c., so as to be always directed to the centre O, but are so\r\nplaced that they are capable of turning on axles which are always\r\nhorizontal, so that they can take any angle with respect to the\r\nwater which may be given to them. From the centres, or the line\r\njoining the pivots on which these paddle-boards turn, there\r\nproceed short arms K, firmly fixed to the paddle-boards at an\r\nangle of about 120°. On a motion given to this arm K, it will\r\ntherefore give a corresponding angular motion to the paddle-board,\r\nso as to make it turn on its pivots. At [Pg477] the extremities\r\nof the several arms marked K is a pin or pivot, to which the\r\nextremities of the radial arms L are severally attached, so that\r\nthe angle between each radial arm L and the short paddle-arm K is\r\ncapable of being changed by any motion imparted to L; the radial\r\narms are connected at the other end with a centre, round which\r\nthey are capable of revolving. Now, since the points A B C, &c.,\r\nwhich are the pivots on which the paddle-boards turn, are moved in\r\nthe circumference of a circle, of which the centre is O, they are\r\nalways at the same distance from that point; consequently they\r\nwill continually vary their distance from the other centre P.\r\nThus, when a paddle-board arrives at that point of its revolution\r\nat which the centre round which it revolves lies precisely between\r\nit and the centre O, its distance from the former centre is less\r\nthan in any other position. As it departs from that point, its\r\ndistance from that centre gradually increases until it arrives at\r\nthe opposite point of its revolution, where the centre O is\r\nexactly between it and the former centre; then the distance of the\r\npaddle-board from the former centre is greatest. [Pg478] This\r\nconstant change of distance between each paddle-board and the\r\ncentre P is accommodated by the variation of the angle between the\r\nradial arm L and the short paddle-board arm K; as the paddle-board\r\napproaches the centre P this gradually diminishes; and as the\r\ndistance of the paddle-board increases, the angle is likewise\r\naugmented. This change in the magnitude of the angle, which thus\r\naccommodates the varying position of the paddle-board with respect\r\nto the centre P, will be observed in the figure. The paddle-board\r\nD is nearest to P; and it will be observed that the angle\r\ncontained between L and K is there very acute; at E the angle\r\nbetween L and K increases, but is still acute; at G it increases\r\nto a right angle; at H it becomes obtuse; and at K, where it is\r\nmost distant from the centre P, it becomes most obtuse. It again\r\ndiminishes at K, and becomes a right angle between A and B. Now\r\nthis continual shifting of the direction of the short arm K is\r\nnecessarily accompanied by an equivalent change of position in the\r\npaddle-board to which it is attached; and the position of the\r\nsecond centre P is, or may be, so adjusted that this paddle-board,\r\nas it enters the water and emerges from it, shall be such as shall\r\nbe most advantageous for propelling the vessel, and therefore\r\nattended with less of that vibration which arises chiefly from the\r\nalternate depression and elevation of the water, owing to the\r\noblique action of the paddle-boards.\r\n\r\n\r\n(225.) In the year 1833, Mr. Field, of the firm of Maudslay and\r\nField, constructed a paddle-wheel with fixed paddle-boards, but\r\neach board being divided into several narrow slips arranged one a\r\nlittle behind the other, as represented in _fig._ 134. These\r\ndivided boards he proposed to arrange in such cycloidal curves\r\nthat they must all enter the water at the same place in immediate\r\nsuccession, avoiding the shock produced by the entrance of the\r\ncommon board. These split paddle-boards are as efficient in\r\npropelling when at the lowest point as the common paddle-boards,\r\nand when they emerge the water escapes simultaneously from each\r\nnarrow board, and is not thrown up, as is the case with common\r\npaddle-boards.[39]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 134.]\r\n\r\n[Pg479] The theoretical effect of this wheel is the same as that\r\nof the common wheel, and experience alone, the result of which has\r\nnot yet been obtained, can prove its efficiency. The number of\r\nbars, or separate parts into which each paddle-board is divided,\r\nhas been very various. When first introduced by Mr. Galloway each\r\nboard was divided into six or seven parts: this was subsequently\r\nreduced, and in the more recent wheels of this form constructed\r\nfor the government vessels the paddle-boards consist only of two\r\nparts, coming as near to the common wheel as is possible, without\r\naltogether abandoning the principle of the split paddle.\r\n\r\n\r\n(226.) To obtain an approximate estimate of the extent to which\r\nsteam-power is applicable to long sea-voyages, it would be\r\nnecessary to investigate the mutual relation which, in the\r\nexisting state of this application of steam-power, exists between\r\nthe capacity or tonnage of the vessel, the magnitude, weight, and\r\npower, of the machinery, the available stowage for fuel, and the\r\naverage speed attainable in all [Pg480] weathers, as well as the\r\ngeneral purposes to which the vessel is to be appropriated,\r\nwhether for the transport of goods or merchandise, or merely for\r\ndespatches and passengers, or for both of these combined. That\r\nportion of the capacity of the vessel which is appropriated to the\r\nmoving power consists of the space occupied by the machinery and\r\nthe fuel. The distribution of it between these must mainly depend\r\non the length of the voyage which the vessel must make without\r\nreceiving a fresh supply of coals. If the trips be short, and\r\nfrequent relays of fuel can be obtained, then the space allotted\r\nto the machinery may bear a greater proportion to that assigned to\r\nthe fuel; but in proportion as each uninterrupted stage of the\r\nvoyage is increased, a greater stock of coals will be necessary,\r\nand a proportionally less space left for the machinery. Other\r\nthings being the same, therefore, steam-vessels intended for long\r\nsea-voyages must be less powerful in proportion to their tonnage.\r\n\r\nIt will be apparent that every improvement which takes place in\r\nthe application of the steam-engine to navigation will modify all\r\nthese data on which such an investigation must depend. Every\r\nincreased efficiency of fuel, from whatever cause it may be\r\nderived, will either increase the useful tonnage of the vessel, or\r\nincrease the length of the voyage of which it is capable. Various\r\nimprovements have been and are still in progress, by which this\r\nefficiency has undergone continual augmentation, and voyages may\r\nnow be accomplished with moderate economy and profit, to which a\r\nfew years since marine engines could not be applied with permanent\r\nadvantage. The average speed of steam-vessels has also undergone a\r\ngradual increase by such improvements. During the four years\r\nending June, 1834, it was found that the average rate of steaming\r\nobtained from fifty-one voyages made by the Admiralty steamers\r\nbetween Falmouth and Corfu, exclusive of stoppages, was seven\r\nmiles and a quarter an hour direct distance between port and port.\r\nThe vessels which performed this voyage varied from 350 to 700\r\ntons measured burden, and were provided with engines varying from\r\n100 to 200 horse-power, with stowage for coals varying from 80 to\r\n240 tons. The proportion of the power to the [Pg481] tonnage\r\nvaried from one horse to three tons to one horse to four tons.\r\nThus the MESSENGER had a power of 200 horses and measured 730\r\ntons; the FLAMER had a power of 120 horses, and measured 500 tons;\r\nthe COLUMBIA had a power of 120 horses, and measured 360 tons. In\r\ngeneral it may be assumed that for the shortest class of trips,\r\nsuch as those of the Channel steamers, the proportion of the power\r\nto the tonnage should be about one horse for every two tons; but\r\nfor the longer class of voyages, the proportion of power to\r\ntonnage should be about one horse-power to from three to four tons\r\nmeasured tonnage. These data, however, must be received as very\r\nrough approximations, subject to considerable modifications in\r\ntheir application to particular vessels. We have already stated\r\nthat the nominal horse-power is itself extremely indefinite; and\r\nif, as is now customary in the longer class of voyages, the steam\r\nbe worked expansively, then the nominal power almost ceases to\r\nhave any definite relation to the actual performance of the\r\nvessel. It is usual to calculate the horse-power by assuming a\r\nuniform pressure of steam upon the piston, and, consequently, by\r\nexcluding the consideration of the effect of expansion. The most\r\ncertain test of the amount of mechanical power exerted by the\r\nmachinery would be obtained from the quantity of water actually\r\ntransmitted in the form of steam from the boiler to the cylinder.\r\nBut the effect of this would also be influenced by the extent to\r\nwhich the expansive principle has been brought into operation.\r\n\r\nFrom the reported performances of the larger class of steam-ships\r\nwithin the last few years, it would appear that the average speed\r\nhas been increased since the estimate above mentioned, which was\r\nobtained in 1834; and on comparing the consumption of fuel with\r\nthe actual performance, it would appear that the efficiency of\r\nfuel has also been considerably augmented. No extensive course of\r\naccurate experiments or observations have, however, been obtained\r\nfrom which correct inferences may be drawn of the probable limits\r\nto which steam-navigation, in its present state, is capable of\r\nbeing extended. The jealousy of rival companies has obstructed the\r\ninquiries of those who, solicitous more [Pg482] for the general\r\nadvancement of the art than for the success of individual\r\nenterprises, have directed their attention to this question; and\r\nit is hardly to be expected that sufficiently correct and\r\nextensive data can be obtained for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n(227.) Increased facility in the extension and application of\r\nsteam-navigation is expected to arise from the substitution of iron\r\nfor wood, in the construction of vessels. Hitherto iron steamers\r\nhave been chiefly confined to river-navigation; but there appears no\r\nsufficient reason why their use should be thus limited. For\r\nsea-voyages they offer many advantages; they are not half the weight\r\nof vessels of equal tonnage constructed of wood; and, consequently,\r\nwith the same tonnage they will have less draught of water, and\r\ntherefore less resistance to the propelling power; or, with the same\r\ndraught of water and the same resistance, they will carry a\r\nproportionally heavier cargo. The nature of their material renders\r\nthem more stiff and unyielding than timber; and they do not suffer\r\nthat effect which is called _hogging_, which arises from a slight\r\nalteration which takes place in the figure of a timber vessel in\r\nrolling, accompanied by an alternate opening and closing of the\r\nseams. Iron vessels have the further advantage of being more proof\r\nagainst fracture upon rocks. If a timber vessel strike, a plank is\r\nbroken, and a chasm opened in her many times greater than the point\r\nof rock which produces the concussion. If an iron vessel strike, she\r\nwill either merely receive a dinge, or be pierced by a hole equal in\r\nsize to the point of rock which she encounters. Some examples of the\r\nstrength of iron vessels were given by Mr. Macgregor Laird, in his\r\nevidence before the Committee of the Commons on Steam Navigation,\r\namong which the following may be mentioned:—An iron vessel, called\r\nthe ALBURKAH, in one of their experimental trials got aground, and\r\nlay upon her anchor: in a wooden vessel the anchor would probably\r\nhave pierced her bottom; in this case, however, the bottom was only\r\ndinged. An iron vessel, built for the Irish Inland Navigation\r\nCompany, was being towed across Lough Derg in a gale of wind, when\r\nthe towing rope broke, and she was driven upon rocks, on which she\r\nbumped for a considerable time [Pg483] without any injury. A wooden\r\nvessel would in this case have gone to pieces. A further advantage\r\nof iron vessels (which in warm climates is deserving of\r\nconsideration) is their greater coolness and perfect freedom from\r\nvermin.\r\n\r\nIron steam-vessels on a very large scale are now in preparation in\r\nthe ports of Liverpool and Bristol, intended for long sea-voyages.\r\nThe largest vessel of this description which has yet been\r\nprojected is stated to be in preparation for the voyage between\r\nBristol and New York, by the company who have established the\r\nsteam-ship called the Great Western, plying between these places.\r\n\r\nSeveral projects for the extension of steam-navigation to voyages\r\nof considerable length have lately been entertained both by the\r\npublic and by the legislature, and have imparted to every attempt\r\nto improve steam-navigation increased interest. A committee of the\r\nHouse of Commons collected evidence and made a report in the last\r\nsession in favour of an experiment to establish a line of\r\nsteam-communication between Great Britain and India. Two routes\r\nhave been suggested by the committee, each being a continuation of\r\nthe line of Admiralty steam-packets already established to Malta\r\nand the Ionian Isles. One of the routes proposed is through Egypt,\r\nthe Red Sea, and across the Indian Ocean to Bombay, or some of the\r\nother presidencies; the other across the north part of Syria to\r\nthe banks of the Euphrates, by that river to the Persian Gulf, and\r\nfrom thence to Bombay. Each of these routes will be attended with\r\npeculiar difficulties, and in both a long sea-voyage will be\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\nIn the route by the Red Sea it is proposed to establish steamers\r\nbetween Malta and Alexandria (eight hundred and sixty miles). A\r\nsteamer of four hundred tons' burden and one hundred horse-power\r\nwould perform this voyage, upon an average of all weathers\r\nincident to the situation, in from five to six days, consuming ten\r\ntons of coal per day. But it is probable that it might be found\r\nmore advantageous to establish a higher ratio between the power\r\nand the tonnage. From Alexandria the transit might be effected by\r\nland across the isthmus to Suez—a journey of from four to five\r\ndays—by caravan and camels; or the transit might be made either\r\n[Pg484] by land or water from Alexandria to Cairo, a distance of\r\none hundred and seventy-three miles; and from Cairo to Suez,\r\nninety-three miles, across the desert, in about five days. At Suez\r\nwould be a station for steamers, and the Red Sea would be\r\ntraversed in three runs or more. If necessary, stations for coals\r\nmight be established at Cosseir, Judda, Mocha, and finally at Aden\r\nor at Socatra—an island immediately beyond the mouth of the Red\r\nSea, in the Indian Ocean; the run from Suez to Cosseir would be\r\nthree hundred miles—somewhat more than twice the distance from\r\nLiverpool to Dublin. From Cosseir to Judda, four hundred and fifty\r\nmiles; from Judda to Mocha, five hundred and seventeen miles; and\r\nfrom Mocha to Socatra, six hundred and thirty-two miles. It is\r\nevident that all this would, without difficulty, in the most\r\nunfavourable weather, fall within the present powers of\r\nsteam-navigation. If the terminus of the passage be Bombay, the\r\nrun from Socatra to Bombay will be twelve hundred miles, which\r\nwould be from six to eight days' steaming. The whole passage from\r\nAlexandria to Bombay, allowing three days for delay between Suez\r\nand Bombay, would be twenty-six days: the time from Bombay to\r\nMalta would therefore be about thirty-three days; and adding\r\nfourteen days to this for the transit from Malta to England, we\r\nshould have a total of forty-seven days from London to Bombay, or\r\nabout seven weeks.\r\n\r\nIf the terminus proposed were Calcutta, the course from Socatra\r\nwould be one thousand two hundred and fifty miles south-east to\r\nthe Maldives, where a station for coals would be established. This\r\ndistance would be equal to that from Socatra to Bombay. From the\r\nMaldives, a run of four hundred miles would reach the southern\r\npoint of Ceylon, called the Point de Galle, which is the best\r\nharbour (Bombay excepted) in British India: from the Point de\r\nGalle, a run of six hundred miles will reach Madras, and from\r\nMadras to Calcutta would be a run of about six hundred miles. The\r\nvoyage from London to Calcutta would be performed in about sixty\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAt a certain season of the year there exists a powerful physical\r\nopponent to the transit from India to Suez: from [Pg485] the\r\nmiddle of June until the end of September, the south-west monsoon\r\nblows with unabated force across the Indian Ocean, and more\r\nparticularly between Socatra and Bombay. This wind is so violent\r\nas to leave it barely possible for the most powerful steam-packet\r\nto make head against it, and the voyage could not be accomplished\r\nwithout serious wear and tear upon the vessels during these\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nThe attention of parliament has therefore been directed to another\r\nline of communication, not liable to this difficulty: it is\r\nproposed to establish a line of steamers from Bombay through the\r\nPersian Gulf to the Euphrates.\r\n\r\nThe run from Bombay to a place called Muscat, on the southern shore\r\nof the gulf, would be eight hundred and forty miles in a north-west\r\ndirection, and therefore not opposed to the south-west monsoon. From\r\nMuscat to Bassidore, a point upon the northern coast of the strait\r\nat the mouth of the Persian Gulf, would be a run of two hundred and\r\nfifty-five miles; from Bassidore to Bushire, another point on the\r\neastern coast of the Persian Gulf, would be a run of three hundred\r\nmiles; and from Bushire to the mouth of the Euphrates, would be one\r\nhundred and twenty miles. It is evident that the longest of these\r\nruns would offer no more difficulty than the passage from Malta to\r\nAlexandria. From Bussora, near the mouth of the Euphrates, to Bir, a\r\ntown upon its left bank near Aleppo, would be one thousand one\r\nhundred and forty-three miles, throughout which there are no\r\nphysical obstacles to the river-navigation which may not be\r\novercome. Some difficulties arise from the wild and savage character\r\nof the tribes who occupy its banks. It is, however, thought that by\r\nproper measures, and securing the co-operation of the pacha of\r\nEgypt, any serious obstruction from this cause may be removed. From\r\nBir, by Aleppo, to Scanderoon, a port upon the Mediterranean,\r\nopposite Cyprus, is a land-journey, said to be attended with some\r\ndifficulty, but not of great length; and from Scanderoon to Malta is\r\nabout the same distance as between the latter place and Alexandria.\r\nIt is calculated that the time from London to Bombay by the\r\nEuphrates—supposing the passage to be successfully [Pg486]\r\nestablished—would be a few days shorter than by Egypt and the Red\r\nSea.\r\n\r\nWhichever of these courses may be adopted, it is clear that the\r\ndifficulties, so far as the powers of the steam engine are\r\nconcerned, lie in the one case between Socatra and Bombay, or\r\nbetween Socatra and the Maldives, and in the other case between\r\nBombay and Muscat. This, however, has already been encountered and\r\novercome on four several voyages by the HUGH LINDSAY steamer from\r\nBombay to Suez: that vessel encountered a still longer run on\r\nthese several trips, by going, not to Socatra, but to Aden, a\r\npoint on the coast of Arabia, near the Straits of Babel Mandeb,\r\nbeing a run of one thousand six hundred and forty-one miles, which\r\nshe performed in ten days and nineteen hours. The same trip has\r\nsince been repeatedly made by other steamers; and, in the present\r\nimproved state of steam navigation, no insurmountable obstacles\r\nare opposed to their passage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [35] This cut is taken from the plate of the engine of the Red\r\n  Rover, manufactured by Boulton and Watt, given in the last\r\n  edition of _Tredgold on the Steam Engine_.\r\n\r\n  [36] Appendix I., _on Marine Boilers, by J.

The credit of having afforded the first practical solution\r\nof the problem to apply the steam engine to the propulsion of\r\nships, undoubtedly belongs to the people of the United States of\r\nAmerica. The geographical character of their vast country, not\r\nless than the sanguine and enterprising spirit of the nation,\r\ncontributed to this. A coast of four thousand miles in extent,\r\nstretching from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the embouchures of the\r\nMississippi, indented and [Pg488] serrated in every part with\r\nnatural harbours and sheltered bays, and fringed with islands\r\nforming sounds—capes, and promontories enclosing arms of the sea,\r\nin which the waters are free from the roll of the ocean, and take\r\nthe placid character of lakes,—rivers of imposing magnitude,\r\nnavigable for vessels of the largest class, for many hundreds and\r\nin some instances for many thousands of miles, affording access to\r\nthe innermost population of an empire, whose area vastly exceeds\r\nthe whole European continent,—chains of lakes composed of the\r\nmost extensive bodies of fresh water in the known world,—and this\r\nextensive continent peopled by races carrying with them the habits\r\nand feelings together with much of the skill and knowledge of the\r\nmost civilized parts of the globe, endowed also with that\r\ninextinguishable spirit of enterprise which ever belongs to an\r\nemigrant people,—form a combination of circumstances more than\r\nsufficient to account for the fact of this nation snatching from\r\nEngland, the parent of the steam engine, the honour of first\r\nbringing into practical operation one of the most important—if\r\nindeed it be not altogether the most important—of the many\r\napplications of that machine to the uses of life.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which rendered these extensive tracts of inland\r\nand coast navigation eminently suited to the application of steam\r\npower, formed so many obstructions and difficulties to the\r\napplication of other more ordinary means of locomotion on water.\r\nThe sheltered bays and sounds which offered a smooth and\r\nundisturbed surface to the action of the infant steamer argued the\r\nabsence of that element which gave effect to the sails and rigging\r\nof the wind-propelled ship, and the rapid currents of the gigantic\r\nstreams formed by the drainage of this great continent, though\r\nfacilitating access to the coast, rendered the oar powerless in\r\nthe ascent.\r\n\r\n\r\n(229.) The first great discovery of Watt had scarcely been\r\nrealized in practice by the construction of the single-acting\r\nsteam-engine, when the speculative and enterprising Americans\r\nconceived the project of applying it as a moving power in their\r\ninland navigation. So early as the year 1783 [Pg489] Fitch and\r\nRumsey made attempts to apply the single-acting engine to the\r\npropulsion of vessels, and their failure is said to have arisen\r\nmore from the inherent defects of that machine in reference to\r\nthis application of it, than from any want of ingenuity or\r\nmechanical skill on their parts. In 1791, John Stevens of Hoboken\r\ncommenced his experiments on steam navigation, which were\r\ncontinued for sixteen years; during a part of this period he was\r\nassisted by Livingstone (who was subsequently instrumental in\r\nadvancing the views of Fulton), and by Roosevelt. These projectors\r\nhad, at that time also, the assistance and advice of Brunel, since\r\nso celebrated for the invention of the block machinery, and the\r\nconstruction of the Thames Tunnel. Their proceedings were\r\ninterrupted by the appointment of Livingstone as American Minister\r\nat Paris, under the Consular Government.\r\n\r\nAt Paris, Livingstone met Fulton, who had been previously engaged\r\nin similar speculations, and being struck with his mechanical\r\nskill, and the soundness of his views, joined him in causing a\r\nseries of experiments to be made, which were accordingly carried\r\non at Plombières, and subsequently on a still more extensive scale\r\non the Seine, near Paris. Having by this course of experiments\r\nobtained proofs of the efficiency of Fulton's projects, sufficient\r\nto satisfy the mind of Livingstone, he agreed to obtain for Fulton\r\nthe funds necessary to construct a steam boat on a large scale, to\r\nbe worked upon the Hudson. It was decided, in order to give the\r\nproject the best chance of success, to obtain the machinery from\r\nBolton and Watt. In 1803, Fulton accordingly made drawings of the\r\nengines intended for this first steamer, which were sent to Soho,\r\nwith an order for their construction. Fulton, meanwhile, repaired\r\nto America, to superintend the construction of the boat. The\r\ndelays incidental to these proceedings retarded the completion of\r\nthe boat and machinery until the year 1807, when all was\r\ncompleted, and the first successful experiment made at New York.\r\nThe vessel was placed, for regular work, to ply between New York\r\nand Albany, in the beginning of 1808; and, from that time to the\r\npresent, this river has been the theatre of the most [Pg490]\r\nremarkable series of experiments on locomotion on water which has\r\never been presented in the history of navigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n(230.) The form and arrangement of this first marine engine was,\r\nin many respects, similar to that which is still generally used\r\nfor marine purposes. The cold water cistern was abandoned, and an\r\nincreased condensing power obtained by enlarging the condenser. It\r\nwas usual to make the condenser half the diameter of the cylinder,\r\nand half its length, and therefore one eighth of its capacity. The\r\ncondenser, however, was now made of the same diameter as the\r\ncylinder, being still half its length; its capacity therefore,\r\ninstead of being only an eighth, was half of the cylinder; the\r\ncondensing jet was admitted by a pipe passing through the bottom\r\nof the vessel. As in the present marine engines, two working beams\r\nwere provided, one at either side of the cylinder; but in order to\r\nprovide against the difficulties which might arise in the\r\nadaptation of machinery made at Birmingham to a vessel made at New\r\nYork, beams were constructed in the form of an inverted ┻, the\r\nworking arms being twofold, one horizontal and the other vertical,\r\nso that the connecting rod might be carried from the crank, either\r\ndownwards, to the end of the horizontal arm, or horizontally, to\r\nthe end of the vertical arm. In fact there was a choice, to use\r\neither a straight beam, or a bell-crank. The latter was that which\r\nwas adopted in this instance. The paddle-shaft, driven by the\r\ncrank, passed across the vessel, and had the paddle-wheels keyed\r\nupon it as at present; and in order to equalise the effect of the\r\nengine spur wheels were also placed on the paddle-shaft, by which\r\npinions were driven, placed upon an axle, which carried a\r\nfly-wheel.\r\n\r\nThe speed attained by this steam boat, when it first began to ply\r\nupon the river, did not exceed four miles an hour, but by a series\r\nof improvements its rate of motion was soon increased to six miles\r\nan hour. In the steam boats subsequently constructed by Fulton a\r\ngreater speed was attained; but in the latest vessels built by him\r\nhe did not exceed a speed of nine miles an hour, which he\r\nconsidered to be the greatest that could be advantageously\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nWhile Fulton was making his plans, and engaged in the [Pg491]\r\nconstruction of his first boat, Mr. Stevens of Hoboken, already\r\nmentioned, was engaged in a like project, and completed a vessel,\r\nto be propelled by a steam engine, within a few weeks after the\r\nfirst successful voyage of Fulton. Stevens was likewise completely\r\nsuccessful; but the exclusive privilege of navigating the Hudson\r\nby steam having been granted to Fulton by an act of Congress,\r\nStevens was compelled to select another theatre for his\r\noperations, and he accordingly sent his steam boat by sea to\r\nPhiladelphia, to navigate the Delaware, thus securing for himself\r\nthe honour of having made the first sea voyage by steam.\r\n\r\nFulton did not long retain the monopoly of the steam navigation of\r\nthe Hudson. Fortunately for the progress of steam navigation, the act\r\nconferring upon him that privilege was declared unconstitutional;\r\nand the navigation of that noble river was thrown open to the spirit\r\nand enterprise of American genius. The number of passengers conveyed\r\nupon it became enormous beyond all precedent, and inducements of the\r\nstrongest kind were accordingly held out to the improvement of its\r\nnavigation. The distance between New York and Albany, ascertained by\r\na late survey to be one hundred and twenty-five geographical miles by\r\nwater, had been performed by Fulton's boats occasionally in fifteen\r\nor sixteen hours, being at the rate of about eight miles an hour,\r\nincluding stoppages. It became a great object to increase the speed\r\nof this trip, so that it might at all times of the year be performed\r\nbetween sunrise and sunset. Robert L. Stevens, the son of the person\r\nof that name already mentioned, immediately after the abolition\r\nof Fulton's monopoly, placed on the river a vessel which had been\r\nbuilt for the Delaware, which easily performed the passage in twelve\r\nhours, being at the rate of nearly ten and a half geographical miles\r\nan hour. By this increase of speed the improved boats so entirely\r\nmonopolised the day work upon the river, that the former steamers\r\nwere either converted into steam tugs to draw barges laden with\r\ngoods, or used for night trips between New York and Albany. In the\r\nnight trips the saving of one or two hours was immaterial, it being\r\nsufficient that the vessel which left the one port at night should\r\nreach the other in the morning. [Pg492]\r\n\r\nThe river Hudson rises near Lake Champlain, the easternmost of the\r\ngreat chain of lakes or inland seas which extend from east to west\r\nacross the northern boundary of the United States. The river\r\nfollows nearly a straight course southwards for two hundred and\r\nfifty miles, and empties itself into the sea at New York. The\r\ninfluence of the tide is felt as far as Albany, above which the\r\nstream begins to contract. Although this river in magnitude and\r\nextent is by no means equal to several others which intersect the\r\nStates, it is nevertheless rendered an object of great interest by\r\nreason of the importance and extent of its trade. The produce of\r\nthe state of New York and that of the banks of the great Lakes\r\nOntario and Erie are transported by it to the capital; and one of\r\nthe most extensive and populous districts of the United States is\r\nsupplied with the necessary imports by its waters. A large fleet\r\nof vessels is constantly engaged in its navigation; nor is the\r\ntardy but picturesque sailing vessel as yet excluded by the more\r\nrapid steamers. The current of the Hudson is said to average\r\nnearly three miles an hour; but as the ebb and flow of the tide\r\nare felt as far as Albany, the passage of the steamers between\r\nthat place and New York may be regarded as equally affected by\r\ncurrents in both directions, or nearly so. The passage therefore,\r\nwhether in ascending or descending the river, is made nearly in\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n(231.) The prevalence of smooth water navigation, whether on the\r\nsurfaces of rivers or in sheltered bays and sounds, has invested\r\nthe problem of steam navigation in America with conditions so\r\nentirely distinct and different from those under which the same\r\nproblem presents itself to the European engineer, that any\r\ncomparison of the performance of vessels, whether with regard to\r\nspeed or the absorption of power in the two cases, must be utterly\r\nfallacious. In Europe a steamer is almost invariably a vessel\r\ndesigned to encounter the agitated surface of an open sea, and is\r\naccordingly constructed upon principles of suitable strength and\r\nstability. It is likewise supplied with rigging and with sails, to\r\nbe used in aid of the mechanical power, and manned and commanded\r\nby experienced seamen; in fact, it is a combination of a nautical\r\nand mechanical structure. In America, on the other hand, [Pg493]\r\nwith the exception of the vessels which navigate the great\r\nnorthern lakes, the steamers are structures exclusively\r\nmechanical, being designed for smooth water. They require no other\r\nstrength or stability than that which is sufficient to enable them\r\nto float and to bear a progressive motion through the water. Their\r\nmould is conceived with an exclusive view to speed; they are\r\ntherefore slender and weak in their build, of great length in\r\nproportion to their width, and having a very small draught of\r\nwater. In fact, they approach in their form to that of a Thames\r\nwherry on a very large scale.\r\n\r\nThe position and form of the machinery is likewise affected by\r\nthese conditions. Without the necessity of being protected from a\r\nrough sea, it is placed on the deck in an elevated position. The\r\ncylinders of large diameter and short stroke invariably used in\r\nEurope are unknown in America, and the proportions are reversed, a\r\nsmall diameter and stroke of great length being invariably\r\nadopted. It is rarely that two engines are used. A single engine,\r\nplaced in the centre of the deck, with a cylinder from forty to\r\nsixty inches' diameter, and from eight to ten foot stroke, drives\r\npaddle-wheels from twenty-one to twenty-five feet in diameter,\r\nproducing from twenty-five to thirty revolutions per minute. The\r\ngreat magnitude of the paddle-wheels and the velocity imparted to\r\nthem enable them to perform the office of fly-wheels, and to carry\r\nthe engine round its centres, not however without a perceptible\r\ninequality of motion, which gives to the American steamer an\r\neffect like that of a row boat advancing by starts with each\r\nstroke of the piston. The length of stroke adopted in these\r\nengines enables them to apply with great effect the expansive\r\nprinciple, which is almost universally used, the steam being\r\ngenerally cut off at half stroke.\r\n\r\nThe steamers which navigate the Hudson are vessels of considerable\r\nmagnitude, splendidly fitted up for the accommodation of\r\npassengers; they vary from one hundred and eighty to two hundred\r\nand forty feet in length, and from twenty to thirty feet in width\r\nof beam. In the following table is given the particulars of nine\r\nsteamers plying on this river, taken from [Pg494] the work of Mr.\r\nStevenson, and from the paper of Mr. Renwick, inserted in the last\r\nedition of Tredgold:—\r\n\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n                | Length | Breadth | Draft  | Drain  | Length\r\n     Names.     |   of   |   of    |  of    |   of   |   of\r\n                |  Deck. |  Beam.  | Water. | Wheel. | Paddles.\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n                |   Ft.  |   Ft.   |   Ft.  |   Ft.  |   Ft.\r\n  Dewit Clinton |   230  |   28    |   5·5  |   21   |  13·7\r\n  Champlain     |   180  |   27    |   5·5  |   22   |  15\r\n  Erie          |   180  |   27    |   5·5  |   22   |  15\r\n  North America |   200  |   30    |   5    |   21   |  13\r\n  Independence  |   148  |   26    |   ——   |   ——   |  ——\r\n  Albany        |   212  |   26    |   ——   |   24·5 |  14\r\n  Swallow       |   233  |   22·5  |   3·75 |   24   |  11\r\n  Rochester     |   200  |   25    |   3·75 |   23·5 |  10\r\n  Utica         |   200  |   21    |   3·5  |   22   |   9·5\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n                | Depth  | Number |  Drain  | Length| Number | Part of\r\n     Names.     |   of   |   of   |    of   |   of  |   of   | Stroke\r\n                | Paddles| Engines| Cylinder| Stroke|  Revs  | at which\r\n                |        |        |         |       |        |  it is\r\n                |        |        |         |       |        | cut off.\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n                |   In.  |        |   In.   |   Ft. |        |\r\n  Dewit Clinton |   36   |   1    |   65    |   10  |  29    |   3/4\r\n  Champlain     |   34   |   2    |   44    |   10  |  27·5  |   1/2\r\n  Erie          |   34   |   2    |   44    |   10  |  27·5  |   1/2\r\n  North America |   30   |   2    |   44·5  |    8  |  24    |   1/2\r\n  Independence  |   ——   |   1    |   44    |   10  |        |\r\n  Albany        |   30   |   1    |   65    |   ——  |  19    |\r\n  Swallow       |   30   |   1    |   46    |   ——  |  27    |\r\n  Rochester     |   24   |   1    |   43    |   10  |  28    |\r\n  Utica         |   24   |   1    |   39    |   10  |        |\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n\r\nNone of these vessels have either masts or rigging, and\r\nconsequently never derive any propelling power except from the\r\nengines: they are neither manned nor commanded by persons having\r\nany knowledge of navigation: the works that are visible above\r\ntheir decks are the beam and framing of the engine, and the\r\nchimneys.\r\n\r\nThe engines used for steamers on the Hudson, and other great\r\nrivers and bays on the eastern coast of America, are most commonly\r\ncondensing engines, but they nevertheless work with steam of very\r\nhigh pressure, being seldom less than twenty-five pounds per\r\nsquare inch, and sometimes as much as fifty. By reference to the\r\npreceding table it will be seen, that the velocity of the piston\r\ngreatly exceeds the limit generally observed in Europe. It is\r\ncustomary in European marine engines to limit the speed of the\r\npiston to about two hundred and twenty feet per minute. Even the\r\npiston of a locomotive engine does not much exceed the rate of\r\nthree hundred feet per minute. In the American steamers, however,\r\nthe pistons commonly move at the rate of from five to six hundred\r\nfeet per minute, while the circumference of the paddle-wheels are\r\ndriven at the rate of from twenty to twenty-two miles an hour.\r\n[Pg495]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 135.]\r\n\r\nThe hulls of these boats are formed with a perfectly flat bottom\r\nand perpendicular sides, rounded at the angles, as represented in\r\n_fig._ 135. At the bow, or cutwater, they are made very sharp, and\r\nthe deck projects to a great distance over the sides. The weight\r\nof the machinery is distributed over an extensive surface of the\r\nbottom of this feeble structure, by means of a frame-work of\r\nsubstantial carpentry to which it is attached.\r\n\r\nAt the height of from four to six feet above the water-line is\r\nplaced the deck, which is a platform, having the shape of a very\r\nelongated ellipse. The extremities of its longer axis are\r\nsupported by the sternpost and the cutwater, and its sides expand\r\nin gentle curves on either hand to a considerable distance beyond\r\nthe limits of the hull; those parts of the deck thus overhanging\r\nthe water are called the wheel guards.\r\n\r\nBeneath the first deck is the saloon, or dining-room, which also,\r\nas is usual in European steamers, forms the gentlemen's\r\nsleeping-room. It usually extends from end to end of the vessel.\r\nThe middle of the first deck is occupied by the engine, boilers,\r\nfurnaces, and chimneys, of which latter there are generally two.\r\nBetween the chimneys and the stern, above the first deck, is\r\nconstructed the ladies' cabin, which is covered by the second\r\ndeck, called the promenade deck. The great length of these boats\r\nand the elevation of the cabins render it impossible for a\r\nsteersman at the stern to see ahead, and they are, consequently,\r\nsteered from the bow; the wheel placed there communicating with\r\nthe helm at the stern, by chains or rods carried along the sides\r\nof the boat. Until a recent period, the wheel was connected with\r\nthe stern by ropes, but some fatal accidents, produced by fire,\r\n[Pg496] in which these ropes were burnt, and the steersman lost\r\nall power to guide the vessel, caused metal rods or chains to be\r\nsubstituted.\r\n\r\n\r\n(232.) The paddle-wheels universally used in American steam-boats\r\nare formed, as if by the combination of two or more common\r\npaddle-wheels, placed one outside the other, on the same axle, but\r\nso that the paddle boards of each may have an intermediate\r\nposition between those of the adjacent one, as represented in\r\n_fig._ 136.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig._ 136.]\r\n\r\nThe spokes, which are bolted to cast-iron flanges, are of wood.\r\nThese flanges, to which they are so bolted, are keyed upon the\r\npaddle shaft. The outer extremities of the spokes are attached to\r\ncircular bands or hoops of iron, surrounding the wheel; and the\r\npaddle boards, which are formed of hard wood, are bolted to the\r\nspokes. The wheels thus constructed, sometimes consist of three,\r\nand not unfrequently four, independent circles of paddle boards,\r\nplaced one beside the other, and so adjusted in their position,\r\nthat the boards of no two divisions shall correspond.\r\n\r\nThe great magnitude of the paddle-wheels, and the circumstance of\r\nthe navigation being carried on, for the most part, in smooth\r\nwater, have rendered unnecessary, in America, the adoption of any\r\nof those expedients for neutralising the effects of the oblique\r\naction of the paddles, which have been tried, but hitherto with so\r\nlittle success, in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n(233.) Sea-going steamers are not numerous in America, the chief\r\nof them being those which ply between New York and Providence, and\r\nbetween New York and Charleston. These vessels, however, do not\r\nresemble the sea-going steamers of Europe as closely as might be\r\nexpected; and to those who are accustomed to the latter, the\r\nsea-going [Pg497] steamers of America can hardly be regarded as\r\nsafe means of transport.\r\n\r\nIn the following Table is given the dimensions of five of these\r\nvessels, all plying between New York and Providence:—\r\n\r\n  ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n                | Length | Breadth | Draft | Diameter | Length\r\n     Names.     |   of   |   of    |       |   of     |   of\r\n                |  Deck. |  Beam.  |       | Wheel.   | Paddles.\r\n  ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n                |   Ft.  |   Ft.   |  Ft.  |   Ft.    |   Ft.\r\n  Providence    |   180  |   27    |   9   |   ——     |   ——\r\n  Lexington     |   207  |   21    |  ——   |   23     |    9\r\n  Narragansett  |   210  |   26    |   5   |   25     |   11\r\n  Massachusetts |   200  |   29·5  |   8·5 |   22     |   10\r\n  Rhode Island  |   210  |   26    |   6·5 |   24     |   11\r\n  ——————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n                | Depth  | Number | Diameter| Length| Number | Part of\r\n     Names.     |   of   |   of   |    of   |   of  |   of   | Stroke\r\n                | Paddles| Engines| Cylinder| Stroke|  Revs  | at which\r\n                |        |        |         |       |        |  it is\r\n                |        |        |         |       |        | cut off.\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n                |   In.  |        |   In.   |   Ft. |        |\r\n  Providence    |   ——   |    1   |   10    |   65  |        |\r\n  Lexington     |   30   |    1   |   11    |   48  |   24   |\r\n  Narragansett  |   30   |    1   |   60    |   12  |    2   |   1/2\r\n  Massachusetts |   28   |    2   |   44    |    8  |   26   |\r\n  Rhode Island  |   30   |    1   |   11    |   60  |   21   |\r\n  —————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n\r\nThe Narragansett, the finest of these vessels, is built of oak,\r\nstrengthened by diagonal straps or ties of iron, by which her\r\ntimbers are connected; she is driven by a condensing engine, and\r\nhas two boilers, exposing about three thousand square feet of\r\nsurface to the fire. The steam is maintained at a pressure of from\r\ntwenty to twenty-five lbs. per square inch: the cylinder is\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\nThe cabins of these sea-boats are of great magnitude, and afford\r\nexcellent accommodation for passengers, containing generally four\r\nhundred berths. In the Massachusetts the chief cabin is one hundred\r\nand sixty feet long, twenty-two feet wide, and twelve feet in\r\nheight, its vast extent being uninterrupted by pillars or any other\r\nobstruction. \"I have dined,\" says Mr. Stevenson, \"with one hundred\r\nand seventy-five persons in this cabin, and, notwithstanding this\r\nnumerous assembly, the tables, which were arranged in two parallel\r\nrows, extending from one end of the cabin to the other, were far\r\nfrom being fully occupied, the attendance was good, and every thing\r\nwas conducted with perfect regularity and order. There are one\r\nhundred and twelve fixed berths ranged round this cabin, and one\r\nhundred temporary berths can be erected in the middle of the floor:\r\nbesides these there are sixty fixed berths in the ladies' cabin, and\r\nseveral temporary sleeping [Pg498] places can be erected in it\r\nalso. The cabin of the Massachusetts is by no means the largest in\r\nthe United States. Some steamers have cabins upwards of one hundred\r\nand seventy-five feet in length. Those large saloons are lighted by\r\nArgand lamps, suspended from the ceiling, and their appearance, when\r\nbrilliantly lighted up and filled with company, is very remarkable.\r\nThe passengers generally arrange themselves in parties at the\r\nnumerous small tables into which the large tables are converted\r\nafter dinner, and engage in different amusements. The scene\r\nresembles much more the coffee-room of some great hotel than the\r\ncabin of a floating vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n(234.) Nothing has excited more surprise among engineers and\r\nothers interested in steam navigation in Europe, than the\r\nstatements which have been so generally and so confidently made of\r\nthe speed attained by American steamers. This astonishment is due\r\nto several causes, the chief of which is the omission of all\r\nnotice of the great difference between the structure and operation\r\nof the American steamers and the nature of the navigation in which\r\nthey are engaged, compared with the structure and operation of,\r\nand the navigation in which European steamers are employed: as\r\nwell might the performance of a Thames wherry, or one of the\r\nfly-boats on the northern canals, be compared with that of the\r\nGreat Western, or the British Queen. The statements alluded to all\r\nhave reference to steamers navigating the Hudson between New York\r\nand Albany, the form and structure of which we have already\r\ndescribed; and doubtless the greatest speed ever attained on the\r\nsurface of water has been exhibited in the passages of these\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nMr. Stevenson states, that exclusive of the time lost in\r\nstoppages, the voyage between New York and Albany is usually made\r\nin ten hours. Dr. Renwick, however, who has probably more\r\nextensive opportunities of observation, states, that the average\r\ntime, exclusive of stoppages, is ten hours and a half. The\r\ndistance being 125·18 geographical miles, the average rate would\r\ntherefore be 11-9/10 miles per hour. If it be observed that the\r\naverage rate of some of the best sea-going steamers in Europe\r\nobtained from experiments [Pg499] and observations made by\r\nmyself, more than three years ago, showed a rate of steaming\r\nlittle less than ten geographical miles per hour, and that since\r\nthat time considerable improvements in steam navigation have been\r\nmade, and further, that these performances were made under\r\nexposure to all the disadvantages of an open sea, the difference\r\nbetween them and the performance of the American river steamers\r\nwill cease to create astonishment.\r\n\r\nDr. Renwick states that he made, in a boat called the \"New\r\nPhiladelphia,\" one of the most remarkable passages ever performed.\r\nHe left New York at five in the afternoon, with the first of the\r\nflood, and landed at Catskill, distant 95·8 geographical miles\r\nfrom New York, at a quarter before twelve. Passengers were landed\r\nand taken in at seven intermediate points: the rate, including\r\nstoppages, was therefore 14·2 miles per hour; and if half an hour\r\nbe allowed for stoppages, the actual average rate of motion would\r\nbe fifteen miles and three quarters an hour. As the current, which\r\nin this case was with the course of the vessel, did not exceed\r\nthree miles and a half an hour, the absolute velocity through the\r\nwater would have been somewhat under twelve miles an hour. This\r\nspeed is nearly the same as the speed obtained from taking the\r\naverage time of the voyages between New York and Albany at ten\r\nhours and a half; it would therefore appear that the great speed\r\nattained in this trip must have been chiefly, if not altogether,\r\nowing to the effect of the current.\r\n\r\n\r\n(235.) The steamers which navigate the great northern lakes differ\r\nso little in their construction and appearance from the European\r\nsteam-boats, that it will not be necessary here to devote any\r\nconsiderable space to an account of them. These vessels were\r\nintroduced on the lakes at about the same time that steamers were\r\nfirst introduced on the Clyde. These steamers are strongly built\r\nvessels, supplied with sails and rigging, and propelled by\r\npowerful engines. The largest in 1837, when Mr. Stevenson visited\r\nthe States, was the _James Madison_. This vessel was one hundred\r\nand eighty-one feet in length on the deck, thirty feet in breadth\r\nof beam, and twelve feet six inches in depth of hold: her draught\r\nof water was ten feet, and her measured capacity seven hundred\r\n[Pg500] tons. She plyed between Buffalo on Lake Erie and Chicago\r\non Lake Michigan, a distance of nine hundred and fifty miles.\r\n\r\nThe severe storms and formidable sea encountered on the lakes\r\nrender necessary for the navigation, vessels in all respects as\r\nstrong and powerful as those which navigate the open ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n(236.) By far the most remarkable and important of all the\r\nAmerican rivers is the Mississippi and its tributaries. That part\r\nof the American continent which extends from the southern shores\r\nof the great northern lakes to the northern shores of the Gulf of\r\nMexico, is watered by these great streams. The main stream of the\r\nMississippi has its fountains in the tract of country lying north\r\nof the Illinois and east of Lake Michigan, in latitude forty-three\r\ndegrees. At about latitude thirty-nine degrees, a little north of\r\nSt. Louis, it receives the waters of the Missouri, and further\r\nsouth, at the latitude of thirty-seven degrees, the Ohio flows\r\ninto it, after traversing five degrees of longitude and four of\r\nlatitude, and winding its way from the Alleghany range through\r\nseveral of the states, and forming a navigable communication with\r\nnumerous important towns of the Union, among which may be\r\nmentioned Pittsburg, Cincinnati, Frankfort, Lexington, and\r\nLouisville. The main stream of the Mississippi, after receiving\r\nthe waters of the Arkansas, and numerous other minor tributaries,\r\nflows into the Gulf of Mexico by four mouths. The main stream of\r\nthe Mississippi, independently of its tributaries, forms an\r\nunbroken course of inland navigation for a distance of nearly two\r\nthousand three hundred miles. Its width, through a distance of one\r\nthousand one hundred miles from its mouth, is not less than half a\r\nmile, and its average depth a hundred feet. The Ohio, its chief\r\neastern tributary, flowing into it at a distance of about a\r\nthousand miles from its mouth, traverses also about the same\r\nextent of country, and is navigable throughout the whole of that\r\nextent. This river also has several navigable tributaries of\r\nconsiderable extent, among which may be mentioned the Muskingum,\r\nnavigable for one hundred and twenty miles; the Miami, navigable\r\nfor seventy-five miles; the Scioto, navigable for one hundred and\r\ntwenty [Pg501] miles; the Tennessee, navigable for two hundred\r\nand fifty miles; the Cumberland, navigable for four hundred and\r\nforty miles; the Kentucky, navigable for one hundred and thirty\r\nmiles; and the Green River, navigable for one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles. The total length of the Ohio and its tributaries is\r\nestimated at above seven thousand miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n(237.) Steam-boats were introduced on the Mississippi about the\r\nyear 1812, the period of their first introduction in Europe; and\r\ntheir increase has been rapid beyond all precedent. In the year\r\n1831 there were one hundred and ninety-eight steamers plying on\r\nits waters; and the number in 1837 amounted to nearly four\r\nhundred. These vessels are built chiefly on the banks of the Ohio,\r\nat the towns of Pittsburg and Cincinnati, at distances of about\r\ntwo thousand miles from the mouth of the river they are intended\r\nto navigate.\r\n\r\n\r\n(238.) These steamers, which are decidedly inferior to those which\r\nnavigate the eastern waters, are generally of a heavy build,\r\nfitted to carry goods as well as passengers, and vary from one\r\nhundred to seven hundred tons burthen. Their draught of water is\r\nalso greater than that of the eastern river steamers—varying from\r\nsix to eight feet. The hull, at about five feet from the water\r\nline, is covered with a deck, under which is the hold, in which\r\nthe heavy part of the cargo is stowed. About the middle of this\r\ndeck the engines are placed, the boilers and furnaces occupying a\r\nspace nearer to the bow, near which two chimneys are placed. The\r\nfire-doors of the furnaces are presented towards the bow, and\r\nexposed so as to increase the draught. That part of the first deck\r\nwhich extends from the machinery to the stern is the place\r\nallotted to the crew and the deck passengers, and is described as\r\nbeing filthy and inconvenient in the extreme. A second deck is\r\nconstructed, which extends from the chimneys near the bow to the\r\nstern of the vessel. On this is formed the great cabin or saloon,\r\nwhich extends from the chimneys to within about thirty feet of the\r\nstern, where it is divided by a partition from the ladies' cabin,\r\nwhich occupies the remaining space. These principal cabins are\r\nsurrounded by a gallery about three feet in width, from which, at\r\nconvenient [Pg502] places, an ascent is supplied by stairs to the\r\nhighest deck, called the hurricane or promenade deck.\r\n\r\n\r\n(239.) The engines by which these boats are propelled are totally\r\ndifferent from the machinery already described as used in the\r\neastern steamers. They are invariably non-condensing engines,\r\nworked by steam of extremely high pressure; the boilers are\r\ntherefore tubular, and the cylinders small in diameter, but\r\ngenerally having a long stroke.\r\n\r\nThe pressure of steam used in these machines is such as is never\r\nused in European engines, even when worked on railways. A pressure\r\nof one hundred pounds per inch is here considered extremely\r\nmoderate. The captain of one of these boats, plying between\r\nPittsburg and St. Louis, told Mr. Stevenson that \"under ordinary\r\ncircumstances his safety valves were loaded with a pressure equal\r\nto one hundred and thirty-eight pounds per square inch, but that\r\nthe steam was occasionally raised as high as one hundred and fifty\r\npounds to enable the vessel to pass parts of the river in which\r\nthere is a strong current;\" and he added, by way of consolation,\r\nthat \"this pressure was never exceeded except on _extraordinary\r\noccasions_!\"\r\n\r\nThe dimensions and power of the Mississippi steamers may be\r\ncollected from those of the St. Louis, a boat which was plying on\r\nthat river in 1837. That vessel measured two hundred and fifty\r\nfeet on deck, and had twenty-eight feet breadth of beam. Her\r\ndraught of water was eight feet, and her measured capacity one\r\nthousand tons. She was propelled by two engines with thirty-inch\r\ncylinders, and ten feet stroke; the safety valve being loaded at\r\none hundred pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\nThe paddle wheels of these vessels are attached to the paddle\r\nshaft, in such a manner as to be thrown into and out of gear, at\r\ndiscretion, by the engineer, so that the paddle shaft may revolve\r\nwithout driving the wheels: by this expedient the power of the\r\nengine is used to feed the boilers while the vessel stops at the\r\nseveral stations. The vessel is therefore stopped, not, as is\r\nusually the case, by stopping the engines, but by throwing the\r\nwheels out of connection with the paddle shaft. The engines\r\ncontinue to work, but their [Pg503] power is expended in forcing\r\nwater into the boiler. By this expedient the activity of the\r\nengines may, within practical limits, be varied with the\r\nresistance the vessel has to encounter. In working against a\r\nstrong current, the feed may be cut off from the boilers, and the\r\nproduction of steam, and consequently the power of the engines,\r\nthereby stimulated, while this suspension of the feed may be\r\ncompensated at the next station.\r\n\r\nThe stoppages to take in goods and passengers, and for relays of\r\nfuel, are frequent. \"The liberty which they take with their\r\nvessels on these occasions,\" says Mr. Stevenson, \"is somewhat\r\namusing: I had a good example of this on board a large vessel,\r\ncalled the Ontario. She was steered close in shore amongst stones\r\nand stumps of trees, where she lay for some hours to take in\r\ngoods: the additional weight increased her draught of water, and\r\ncaused her to heel a good deal; and when her engines were put in\r\nmotion, she actually _crawled_ into the deep water on her paddle\r\nwheels: the steam had been got up to an enormous pressure to\r\nenable her to get off, and the volume of steam discharged from the\r\nescapement pipe at every half stroke of the piston made a sharp\r\nsound almost like the discharge of fire-arms, while every timber\r\nin the vessel seemed to tremble, and the whole structure actually\r\ngroaned under the shocks.\"\r\n\r\nBesides the steamers used for the navigation of the Mississippi,\r\ninnumerable steam tugs are constantly employed in towing vessels\r\nbetween the port of New Orleans and the open sea of the Gulf of\r\nMexico. Before the invention of steam navigation, this southern\r\ncapital of the United States laboured under the disadvantage of\r\npossessing almost the only bad and inconvenient harbour in the\r\nvast range of coast by which the country is bounded. New Orleans\r\nlies at a distance of about one hundred miles from the Gulf of\r\nMexico. The force of the stream, the frequency of shoals, and the\r\nwinding course of the channel rendered it scarcely possible for a\r\nsailing vessel to pass between the port and the sea with the same\r\nwind. The anchorage was every where bad, and great difficulty and\r\nrisk attended the mooring of large vessels to the banks. The steam\r\nengine has, however, overcome all [Pg504] these difficulties, and\r\nrendered the most objectionable harbour of the Union a safe and\r\ngood seaport, perfectly easy of approach and of egress at all\r\ntimes; a small steam tug will take in tow several large ships, and\r\ncarry them with safety and expedition to the offing, where it will\r\ndismiss them on their voyage, and take back vessels which may have\r\narrived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT WESTERN OFF NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\n[Pg505]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n  _On the Relation between the Temperature, Pressure, and Density_\r\n    _of Common Steam._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a fixed relation between the temperature and pressure of\r\ncommon steam, which has not yet been ascertained by theory.\r\nVarious empirical formulæ have been proposed to express it,\r\nderived from tables of temperatures and corresponding pressures\r\nwhich have been founded on experiments and completed by\r\ninterpolation.\r\n\r\nThe following formula, proposed by M. Biot, represents with great\r\naccuracy the relation between the temperature and pressure of\r\ncommon steam, throughout all that part of the thermometric scale\r\nto which experiments have been extended.\r\n\r\nLet\r\n\r\n       a     = 5·96131330259\r\n  log. a_{1} = 0·82340688193 − 1\r\n  log. b_{1} = −·01309734295\r\n  log. a_{2} = 0·74110951837\r\n  log. b_{2} = −·00212510583\r\n\r\nThe relation between the temperature t with reference to the\r\ncentesimal thermometer, and the pressure p in millimètres of\r\nmercury at the temperature of melting ice, will then be expressed\r\nby the following formula:—\r\n\r\n  log. p = a − a_{1}b_{1}^{20 + t} − a_{2}b_{2}^{20 + t}.    (1.)\r\n\r\nFormulæ have, however, been proposed, which, though not applicable\r\nto the whole scale of temperatures, are more manageable in their\r\npractical application than the preceding.\r\n\r\nFor pressures less than an atmosphere, Southern proposed the\r\nfollowing formula, where the pressure is intended to be expressed\r\n[Pg506] in pounds per square inch, and the temperature in\r\nreference to Fahrenheit's thermometer,—\r\n\r\n  p = 0·04948 + ((51·3 + t) / 155·7256)^{5·13}     |\r\n                                                   |.  (2.)\r\n  t = 155·7256 ((p − 0·04948) − 51·3)^{1/(5·13)}   |\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following formula was proposed by Tredgold, where p expresses\r\nthe pressure in inches of mercury:—\r\n\r\n  p = ((100 + t) / 177)^{6}.\r\n\r\nThis was afterwards modified by Mellet, and represents with\r\nsufficient accuracy experiments from 1 to 4 atmospheres. Let p\r\nrepresent pounds per square inch, and t the temperature by\r\nFahrenheit's thermometer,—\r\n\r\n  p = ((103 + t) / 201·18)^{6}   |\r\n                                 |.  (3.)\r\n  t = 201·18 p^{1/6} − 103       |\r\n\r\nM. de Pambour has proposed the following formula, also applicable\r\nthrough the same limits of the scale:—\r\n\r\n  p = ((98·806 + t) / 198·562)^{6}   |\r\n                                     |.  (4.)\r\n  t = 198·562 p^{1/6} − 98·806       |\r\n\r\nMM. Dulong and Arago have proposed the following formula for all\r\npressures between 4 and 50 atmospheres:—\r\n\r\n  p = (0·26793 + 0·0067585 t)^{5}   |\r\n                                    |.  (5.)\r\n  t = 147·961 p^{1/5} − 39·644      |\r\n\r\nIt was about the year 1801, that Dalton, at Manchester, and\r\nGay-Lussac, at Paris, instituted a series of experiments on\r\ngaseous bodies, which conducted them to the discovery of the law\r\nmentioned in art. (96.), p. 171. These philosophers found that all\r\ngases whatever, and all vapours raised from liquids by heat, as\r\nwell as all mixtures of gases and vapours, are subject to the\r\n_same quantity of expansion_ between the temperatures of melting\r\nice and boiling water; and by experiments subsequently made by\r\nDulong and Petit, this uniformity of expansion has been proved to\r\nextend to all temperatures which can come under practical\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\nDalton found that 1000 cubic inches of air at the temperature of\r\nmelting ice dilated to 1325 cubic inches if raised to the\r\ntemperature of boiling water. According to Gay-Lussac, the\r\nincreased volume was 1375 cubic inches. The latter determination\r\nhas been subsequently found to be the more correct one.[40]\r\n\r\n[Pg507] It appears, therefore, that for an increase of temperature\r\nfrom 32° to 212°, amounting to 180°, the increase of volume is 375\r\nparts in 1000; and since the expansion is uniform, the increase of\r\nvolume for 1° will be found by dividing this by 180, which will\r\ngive an increase of 208-1/3 parts in 100,000 for each degree of\r\nthe common thermometer.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the expression of this important and general law to\r\nmathematical language, let v be the volume of an elastic fluid at\r\nthe temperature of melting ice, and let nv be the increase which\r\nthat volume would receive by being raised one degree of\r\ntemperature under the same pressure. Let V be its volume at the\r\ntemperature T. Then we shall have\r\n\r\n  V = v + nv (T − 32) = v (1 + n (T − 32)).\r\n\r\nIf V′ be its volume at any other temperature T′, and under the\r\nsame pressure, we shall have, in like manner,\r\n\r\n  V′ = v (1 + n (T′ − 32)).\r\n\r\nHence we obtain\r\n\r\n  V/V′ = (1 + n (T − 32)) / (1 + n (T′ − 32));   (6.)\r\n\r\nwhich expresses the relation between the volumes of the same gas\r\nor vapour under the same pressure and at any two temperatures. The\r\nco-efficient n, as explained in the text, has the same value for\r\nthe same gas or vapour throughout the whole thermometric scale.\r\nBut it is still more remarkable that this constant has the same\r\nvalue for all gases and vapours. It is a number, therefore, which\r\nmust have some essential relation to the gaseous or elastic state\r\nof fluid matter, independent of the peculiar qualities of any\r\nparticular gas or vapour.\r\n\r\nThe value of n, according to the experiments of Gay-Lussac, is\r\n0·002083, or 1/480.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the law of Mariotte, explained in (97.) p. 171., to\r\nmathematical language, let V, V′ be the volumes of the same gas or\r\nvapour under different pressures P, P′, but at the same\r\ntemperature. We shall then have\r\n\r\n  VP = V′P′.   (7.)\r\n\r\nIf it be required to determine the relation between the volumes of\r\nthe same gas or vapour, under a change of both temperature and\r\npressure, let V be the volume at the temperature T and under the\r\npressure P, and let V′ be the volume at the temperature T′ and\r\nunder the pressure P′. Let v be the volume at the temperature T\r\nand under the pressure P′.\r\n\r\nBy formula (7.) we have\r\n\r\n  VP = vP′;\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg508] and by formula (6.) we have\r\n\r\n  (V′/v) = (1 + n(T′ − 32)) / (1 + n(T − 32))\r\n\r\nEliminating v, we shall obtain\r\n\r\n  (V/V′) = (P′/P) · (1 + n(T − 32)) / (1 + n(T′ − 32));\r\n\r\nor,\r\n\r\n  (VP/V′P′) = (1 + n(T − 32)) / (1 + n(T′ − 32));    (8.)\r\n\r\nwhich is the general relation between the volumes, pressures, and\r\ntemperatures of the same gas or vapour in two different states.\r\n\r\nTo apply this general formula to the case of the vapour of water,\r\nlet T′ = 212°. It is known by experiment that the corresponding\r\nvalue of P′, expressed in pounds per square inch, is 14·706; and\r\nthat V′, expressed in cubic inches, the water evaporated being\r\ntaken as a cubic inch, is 1700. If, then, we take 0·002083 as the\r\nvalue of n, we shall have by (8.),\r\n\r\n  VP = 1700 × 14·706 × (1 + 0·002083 (T − 32)) / (1 + 0·002083 × 180)\r\n\r\n     = 18183(1 + 0·002083 (T − 32)).    (9.)\r\n\r\nIf, by means of this formula (9.), and any of the formulæ (1.),\r\n(2.), (3.), (4.), (5.), T were eliminated, we should obtain a\r\nformula between V and P, which would enable us to compute the\r\nenlargement of volume which water undergoes in passing into steam\r\nunder any proposed pressure. But such a formula would not be\r\nsuitable for practical computations. By the formulæ (1.) to (5.),\r\na table of pressures and corresponding temperatures may be\r\ncomputed; and these being known, the formula (9.) will be\r\nsufficient for the computation of the corresponding values of V,\r\nor the enlargement of volume which water undergoes in passing into\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\nIn the following table, the temperatures corresponding to\r\npressures from 1 to 240 lbs. per square inch are given by\r\ncomputation from the formulæ (2.) to (5.), and the volumes of\r\nsteam produced by an unit of volume of water as computed from the\r\nformula (9.).\r\n\r\nThe mechanical effect is obtained by multiplying the pressure in\r\npounds by the expansion of a cubic inch of water in passing into\r\nsteam expressed in feet, and is therefore the number of pounds\r\nwhich would be raised one foot by the evaporation of a cubic inch\r\nof water under the given pressure.

——————————————+——————————————+—————————————+—————————————\r\n\r\n[Pg511] In the absence of any direct method of determining the\r\ngeneral relation between the pressure and volume of common steam,\r\nempirical formulæ expressing it have been proposed by different\r\nmathematicians.\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Navier proposed the following:—Let S express\r\nthe volume of steam into which an unit of volume of water is\r\nconverted under the pressure P, this pressure being expressed in\r\nkilogrammes per square mètre. Then the relation between S and P\r\nwill be\r\n\r\n  S = a/(b + mP),\r\n\r\n  where a = 1000, b = 0·09, and m = 0·0000484.\r\n\r\nThis formula, however, does not agree with experiment at pressures\r\nless than an atmosphere. M. de Pambour, therefore, proposes the\r\nfollowing changes in the values of its co-efficients:—Let P\r\nexpress the pressure in pounds per square foot; and let\r\n\r\n  a = 10000  b = 0·4227  m = 0·00258,\r\n\r\nand the formula will be accurate for all pressures. For pressures\r\nabove two atmospheres the following values give more accuracy to\r\nthe calculation:—\r\n\r\n  a = 10000  b = 1·421  m = 0·0023.\r\n\r\nIn these investigations I shall adopt the following modified\r\nformula. The symbols S and P retaining their signification, we\r\nshall have\r\n\r\n  S = a/(b + P)  (10.)\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n  a = 3875969     b = 164.\r\n\r\nThese values of a and b will be sufficiently accurate for practical\r\npurposes for all pressures, and may be used in reference to\r\nlow-pressure engines of every form, as well as for high-pressure\r\nengines which work expansively.\r\n\r\nWhen the pressure is not less than 30 pounds per square inch, the\r\nfollowing values of a and b will be more accurate:—\r\n\r\n  a = 4347826      b = 618.\r\n\r\n  _On the Expansive Action of Steam._\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the effect of the expansion of steam which\r\nhas been given in the text, is intended to convey to those who are\r\nnot conversant with the principles and language of analysis, some\r\nnotion of the nature of that mechanical effect to which the\r\nadvantages attending the expansive principle are due. We shall\r\nnow, however, explain these effects more accurately. [Pg512]\r\n\r\nThe dynamical effect produced by any mechanical agent is expressed\r\nby the product of the resistance overcome and the space through\r\nwhich that resistance is moved.\r\n\r\n  Let\r\n      P = the pressure of steam expressed in pounds per square foot.\r\n      S = the number of cubic feet of steam of that pressure\r\n            produced by the evaporation of a cubic foot of water.\r\n      E = the mechanical effect produced by the evaporation of a\r\n            cubic foot of water expressed in pounds raised one foot.\r\n\r\nThen we shall have E = PS; and if W be a volume of water\r\nevaporated under the pressure P, the mechanical effect produced by\r\nit will be WPS.\r\n\r\nBy (10.) we have\r\n\r\n  SP = a − bS.\r\n\r\nHence, for the mechanical effect of a cubic foot of water\r\nevaporated under the pressure P we have\r\n\r\n  E = a − bS.                (11.)\r\n\r\nLet a cubic foot of water be evaporated under the pressure P′, and\r\nlet it produce a volume of steam S′ of that pressure. Let this\r\nsteam afterwards be allowed to expand to the increased volume S\r\nand the diminished pressure P; and let it be required to determine\r\nthe mechanical effect produced during the expansion of the steam\r\nfrom the volume S′ to the volume S.\r\n\r\n  Let\r\n      E′ = the mechanical effect produced by the evaporation of\r\n              the water under the pressure P′ without expansion.\r\n      E″ = the mechanical effect produced during the expansion\r\n              of the steam.\r\n      E  = the mechanical effect which would be produced by\r\n              the evaporation under the pressure P without expansion.\r\n     _E_ = the total mechanical effect produced by the evaporation\r\n              under the pressure P′ and subsequent expansion.\r\n\r\nThus we have\r\n\r\n  _E_ = E′ + E″.\r\n\r\nLet s be any volume of the steam during the process of expansion,\r\np the corresponding pressure, and e″ the mechanical effect\r\nproduced by the expansion of the steam. We have then by (10.)\r\n\r\n  p = (a/s) − b;\r\n\r\n  ∵ de″ = (ads/s) − bds.\r\n\r\nHence by integrating we obtain\r\n\r\n  e″ = a log. s − bs + C;\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg513] which, taken between the limits s = S′ and s = S, becomes\r\n\r\n  E″ = a log. S/S′ − b(S − S′).   (12.)\r\n\r\nBut by (11.) we have\r\n\r\n          E′ = a − bS′,\r\n         E = a − bS;\r\n      ∵ E′ − E = b(S − S′);\r\n    ∵ E″ = a log. S/S′ − E′ + E;\r\n  ∵ _E_ = E″ + E′ = a log. S/S′ + E.   (13.)\r\n\r\nOr,\r\n\r\n  _E_ = a (1 + log. S/S′) − bS.   (14.)\r\n\r\nHence it appears that the mechanical effect of a cubic foot of\r\nwater evaporated under the pressure P may be increased by the\r\nquantity a log. S/S′, if it be first evaporated under the greater\r\npressure P′, and subsequently expanded to the lesser pressure P.\r\n\r\nThe logarithms in these formulæ are hyperbolic.\r\n\r\nTo apply these principles to the actual case of a double acting\r\nsteam engine,\r\n\r\n  Let\r\n      L = the stroke of the piston in feet.\r\n      A = the area of the piston in square feet.\r\n      n = the number of strokes of the piston per minute.\r\n      ∵ 2n AL = the number of cubic feet of space through which\r\n         the piston moves per minute.\r\n  Let cLA = the clearage, or the space between the steam valve\r\n        and the piston at each end of the stroke.\r\n     ∵ The volume of steam admitted through the steam valve\r\n        at each stroke of the engine will be 2n AL(1 + c).\r\n\r\n  Let\r\n      V = the mean speed of the piston in feet per minute,\r\n      ∵ 2nL = V.\r\n\r\nThe volume of steam admitted to the cylinder per minute will\r\ntherefore be VA (1 + c), the part of it employed in working the\r\npiston being VA.\r\n\r\n  Let\r\n      W = the water in cubic feet admitted per minute in the form\r\n            of steam through the steam valve.\r\n      S = the number of cubic feet of steam produced by a cubic\r\n            foot of water.\r\n\r\n[Pg514] Hence we shall have\r\n\r\n  WS = VA (1 + c);\r\n  ∵ S = (VA(1 + c))/W.          (15.)\r\n\r\nSince by (10.) we have\r\n\r\n  P = a/S − b;\r\n  ∵ P = [Wa/(VA(1 + c))] − b.   (16.)\r\n\r\nBy which the pressure of steam in the cylinder will be known, when\r\nthe effective evaporation, the diameter of the cylinder, and speed\r\nof the piston, are given.\r\n\r\nIf it be required to express the mechanical effect produced per\r\nminute by the action of steam on the piston, it is only necessary\r\nto multiply the pressure on the surface of the piston by the space\r\nper minute through which the piston moves. This will give\r\n\r\n  VAP = W(a/(1 + c)) − VAb;     (17.)\r\n\r\nwhich expresses the whole mechanical effect per minute in pounds\r\nraised one foot.\r\n\r\nIf the steam be worked expansively, let it be cut off after the\r\npiston has moved through a part of the stroke expressed by e.\r\n\r\nThe volume of steam of the undiminished pressure P′ admitted per\r\nminute through the valve would then be\r\n\r\n  VA (e + c);\r\n\r\nand the ratio of this volume to that of the water producing it\r\nbeing expressed by S′, we should have\r\n\r\n  S′ = (VA(e + c))/W.\r\n\r\nThe final volume into which this steam is subsequently expanded\r\nbeing VA(1 + c), its ratio to that of the water will be\r\n\r\n  S = (VA (1 + c))/W.\r\n\r\nThe pressure P′, till the steam is cut off, will be\r\n\r\n  P′ = [Wa / (VA(e + c))] − b.   (18.)\r\n\r\nThe mechanical effect E′ produced per minute by the steam of full\r\npressure will be\r\n\r\n  E′ = P′AVe = [Wae / (e + c)] − AVbe;\r\n\r\nand the effect E″ per minute produced by the expansion of the\r\nsteam will by (12.) be [Pg515]\r\n\r\n  E″ = Wa log.[(1 + c) / (e + c)] − bVA(1 − e).\r\n\r\nHence the total effect per minute will be\r\n\r\n  _E_ = Wa [(e/(e + c)) + log.([1 + c]/[e + c])] − bVA.   (19.)\r\n\r\nIf the engine work without expansion, e = 1;\r\n\r\n  ∵ _E′_ = ( Wa/(1 + c)) − bVA,  (20.)\r\n\r\nas before; and the effect per minute gained by expansion will\r\ntherefore be\r\n\r\n  _E_ − _E′_ =\r\n\r\n    Wa [(e/(e + c)) − (1/(1 + c)) + log.([1 + c]/[e + c])];   (21.)\r\n\r\nwhich therefore represents the quantity of power gained by the\r\nexpansive action, with a given evaporating power.\r\n\r\nIn these formulæ the total effect of the steam is considered\r\nwithout reference to the nature of the resistances which it has to\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nThese resistances may be enumerated as follows:—\r\n\r\n  1. The resistance produced by the load which the engine is\r\n  required to move.\r\n\r\n  2. The resistance produced by the vapour which remains\r\n  uncondensed if the engine be a condensing engine, or of the\r\n  atmospheric pressure if the engine do not condense the steam.\r\n\r\n  3. The resistance of the engine and its machinery, consisting\r\n  of the friction of the various moving parts, the resistances\r\n  of the feed pump, the cold water pump, &c. A part of these\r\n  resistances are of the same amount, whether the engine be\r\n  loaded or not, and part are increased, in some proportion\r\n  depending on the load.\r\n\r\nWhen the engine is maintained in a state of uniform motion, the\r\nsum of all these resistances must always be equal to the whole\r\neffect produced by the steam on the piston. The power expended on\r\nthe first alone is the _useful effect_.\r\n\r\nLet R = the pressure per square foot of the piston surface, which\r\nbalances the resistances produced by the load.\r\n\r\nmR = the pressure per square foot, which balances that part of the\r\nfriction of the engine which is proportional to the load.\r\n\r\nr = the pressure per square foot, which balances the sum of all\r\nthose resistances that are not proportional to the load.\r\n\r\nThe total resistance, therefore, being R + mR + r, which, when the\r\nmean motion of the piston is uniform, must be equal to the mean\r\npressure on the piston. The total mechanical effect [Pg516] must\r\ntherefore be equal to the total resistance multiplied by the space\r\nthrough which that resistance is driven. Hence we shall have\r\n\r\n  [R(1 + m) + r]VA = Wa[(e/(e + c)) + log.([1 + c]/[e + c])] − VAb;\r\n\r\n  ∵ RVA(1 + m) = Wa[(e/(e + c)) + log.([1 + c]/[e + c])] − VA(b + r).\r\n\r\nFor brevity, let\r\n\r\n      e′ = a[(e/(e + c)) + log.([1 + c]/[e + c])];\r\n\r\n  ∵ RVA(1 + m) = We′ − VA(b + r).        (22.)\r\n\r\nBy solving this for VA, we obtain\r\n\r\n  VA = We′/(R(1 + m) + b + r);\r\n\r\n  ∵ RVA = We′R/(R(1 + m) + b + r).      (23.)\r\n\r\nThis quantity RVA, being the product of the resistance RA, of the\r\nload reduced to the surface of the piston, multiplied by the space\r\nthrough which the piston is moved, will be equal to the load\r\nitself multiplied by the space through which it is moved. This\r\nbeing, in fact, the useful effect of the engine, let it be\r\nexpressed by U, and we shall have\r\n\r\n  U = We′R/(R(1 + m) + b + r).       (24.)\r\n\r\nOr by (22.),\r\n\r\n  U(1 + m) = We′ − VA(b + r).      (25.)\r\n\r\nThe value of the useful effect obtained from these formulæ will be\r\nexpressed in pounds, raised one foot per minute, W being the\r\neffective evaporation in cubic feet per minute, A the area of the\r\npiston in square feet, and V the space per minute through which it\r\nis moved, in feet.\r\n\r\nSince a resistance amounting to 33,000 pounds moved through one\r\nfoot per minute is called one-horse power, it is evident that the\r\nhorse power H of the engine is nothing more than the useful effect\r\nper minute referred to a larger unit of weight or resistance; that\r\nis to 33,000 pounds instead of one pound. Hence we shall have\r\n\r\n  H = U/33000.         (26.)\r\n\r\nSince the useful effect expressed in (24.) and (25.) is that due\r\nto a number of cubic feet of water, expressed by W, we shall\r\nobtain the effect due to one cubic foot of water, by dividing U by\r\nW. If, therefore, U′ be the effect produced by the effective\r\nevaporation of a cubic foot of water, we shall have [Pg517]\r\n\r\n  U′ = U/W.         (27.)\r\n\r\nIf the quantity of fuel consumed per minute be expressed by F, the\r\neffect produced by the unit of fuel, called the DUTY of the\r\nengine, will, for like reason, be\r\n\r\n  D = U/F.         (28.)\r\n\r\nIf the fuel be expressed in hundredweights of coal, then D will\r\nexpress the number of pounds' weight raised one foot by a\r\nhundredweight of coal.\r\n\r\nBy solving (24.) and (25.) for W, we obtain\r\n\r\n  W = [U(R(1 + m) + b + r)]/Re′,          (29.)\r\n\r\n  W = (1/e′)[U(1 + m) + VA(b + r)].       (30.)\r\n\r\nBy eliminating U, by (26.), we shall have\r\n\r\n  W = [33000 H(R(1 + m) + b + r)]/Re′,       (31.)\r\n\r\n  W = (1/e′)[33000 H(1 + m) + VA(b + r)].    (32.)\r\n\r\nThe evaporation necessary per horse power per minute will be found\r\nby putting H = 1 in these formulæ.[41]\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the quantities A and V, the area of the\r\ncylinder and the speed of the piston, enter all these formulæ as\r\nfactors of the same product. Other things, therefore, being the\r\nsame, the speed of the piston will be always inversely as the area\r\nof the cylinder. In fact, VA is the volume of steam per minute\r\nemployed in working the piston, and if the piston be increased or\r\ndiminished in magnitude, its speed must be inversely [Pg518]\r\nvaried by the necessity of being still moved through the same\r\nnumber of cubic feet by the same volume of steam.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated in the text, that no satisfactory\r\nexperiments have yet been made, by which the numerical value of\r\nthe quantity r can be exactly known. In engines of different\r\nmagnitudes and powers, this resistance bears very different\r\nproportions to the whole power of the machine. In general,\r\nhowever, the larger and more powerful the engine, the less that\r\nproportion will be.\r\n\r\nThat part of this resistance which arises from the reaction of the\r\nuncondensed vapour on the piston is very variable, owing to the\r\nmore or less perfect action of the condensing apparatus, the\r\nvelocity of the piston, and the magnitude and form of the steam\r\npassages. M. de Pambour states, that, by experiments made with\r\nindicators, the mean amount of this resistance in the cylinder is\r\n2-1/2 lbs. per square inch more than in the condenser, and that\r\nthe pressure in the latter being usually 1-1/2 lb. per square\r\ninch, the mean amount of the pressure of the condensed vapour in\r\nthe cylinder is about 4 lbs. per square inch. Engineers, however,\r\ngenerally consider this estimate to be above the truth in\r\nwell-constructed engines, when in good working order.\r\n\r\nIn condensing low pressure engines of forty horse power and\r\nupwards, working with an average load, it is generally considered\r\nthat the resistance produced by the friction of the machine and\r\nthe force necessary to work the pumps may be taken at about 2 lbs.\r\nper square inch of piston surface.\r\n\r\nThus the whole resistance represented by r in the preceding\r\nformulæ, as applied to the larger class of low pressure engines,\r\nmay be considered as being under 6 lbs. per square inch, or 864\r\nlbs. per square foot, of the piston. It is necessary, however, to\r\nrepeat, that this estimate must be regarded as a very rough\r\napproximation; and as representing the mean value of a quantity\r\nsubject to great variation, not only in one engine compared with\r\nanother, but even in the same engine compared with itself at\r\ndifferent times and in different states.\r\n\r\nIn the same class of engines, the magnitude of the clearage is\r\ngenerally about a twentieth part of the capacity of the cylinder,\r\nso that c = 0·05.\r\n\r\nThat part of the resistance which is proportional to the load, and\r\non which the value of m in the preceding formulæ depends, is still\r\nmore variable, and depends so much on the form, magnitude, and the\r\narrangement of its parts, that no general rule can be given for\r\nits value. It must, in fact, be determined in every particular\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nIn the practical application of the preceding formulæ in\r\ncondensing engines we shall have [Pg519]\r\n\r\n  a = 3875969   b = 164   c= 0·05;\r\n\r\n  e′ = 3875969([e/(e + 0·05)] + log.[1·05/(e + 0·05)]).\r\n\r\nIn engines which work without condensation, and therefore with\r\nhigh pressure steam, we shall have\r\n\r\n  a = 4347826   b = 618   c = 0·05\r\n\r\n  e′ = 4347826([e/(e + 0·05)] + log.[1·05/(e + 0·05)])\r\n\r\nTo facilitate computation, the values of e′ corresponding to all\r\nvalues of e, from e = ·10 to e = ·90, are given in the following\r\ntable:—\r\n\r\n  ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————\r\n      |Condensing|Non-condensing||    |Condensing|Non-condensing\r\n      |  Engines |    Engines   ||    |  Engines |   Engines\r\n   e  |    e′.   |      e′.     || e  |    e′.   |     e′.\r\n  ————+——————————+——————————————++————+——————————+———————————————\r\n  ·10 | 10126265 |   11359029   ||·51 | 5966367  |   6692708\r\n  ·11 |  9956867 |   11169008   ||·52 | 5903837  |   6622565\r\n  ·12 |  9793136 |   10985344   ||·53 | 5842288  |   6553525\r\n  ·13 |  9634926 |   10807875   ||·54 | 5781693  |   6485552\r\n  ·14 |  9482029 |   10636364   ||·55 | 5722024  |   6418619\r\n  ·15 |  9334219 |   10470560   ||·56 | 5663251  |   6352693\r\n  ·16 |  9191251 |   10310186   ||·57 | 5605353  |   6287745\r\n  ·17 |  9052888 |   10154978   ||·58 | 5548297  |   6223742\r\n  ·18 |  8918896 |   10004675   ||·59 | 5492064  |   6160662\r\n  ·19 |  8789043 |    9859014   ||·60 | 5436628  |   6098478\r\n  ·20 |  8663120 |    9717760   ||·61 | 5381969  |   6037166\r\n  ·21 |  8540918 |    9580682   ||·62 | 5328065  |   5976699\r\n  ·22 |  8422242 |    9447559   ||·63 | 5274896  |   5917057\r\n  ·23 |  8306916 |    9318193   ||·64 | 5222444  |   5858219\r\n  ·24 |  8194770 |    9192396   ||·65 | 5170684  |   5800159\r\n  ·25 |  8085644 |    9069984   ||·66 | 5119605  |   5742860\r\n  ·26 |  7979392 |    8950796   ||·67 | 5069186  |   5686304\r\n  ·27 |  7875870 |    8834674   ||·68 | 5019410  |   5630469\r\n  ·28 |  7774952 |    8721468   ||·69 | 4970263  |   5575340\r\n  ·29 |  7676514 |    8611048   ||·70 | 4921727  |   5520894\r\n  ·30 |  7580447 |    8503284   ||·71 | 4873790  |   5467121\r\n  ·31 |  7486640 |    8398056   ||·72 | 4826434  |   5414000\r\n  ·32 |  7394990 |    8295250   ||·73 | 4779648  |   5361519\r\n  ·33 |  7305407 |    8194760   ||·74 | 4733417  |   5309659\r\n  ·34 |  7217807 |    8096496   ||·75 | 4687728  |   5258408\r\n  ·35 |  7132097 |    8000352   ||·76 | 4642569  |   5207751\r\n  ·36 |  7048206 |    7906249   ||·77 | 4597928  |   5157676\r\n  ·37 |  6966058 |    7814100   ||·78 | 4553794  |   5108170\r\n  ·38 |  6885585 |    7723832   ||·79 | 4510155  |   5059218\r\n  ·39 |  6806720 |    7635365   ||·80 | 4466999  |   5010808\r\n  ·40 |  6729408 |    7548642   ||·81 | 4424317  |   4962931\r\n  ·41 |  6653578 |    7463580   ||·82 | 4382096  |   4915569\r\n  ·42 |  6579187 |    7380132   ||·83 | 4340332  |   4868720\r\n  ·43 |  6506174 |    7298230   ||·84 | 4299010  |   4822368\r\n  ·44 |  6434491 |    7217822   ||·85 | 4258120  |   4776500\r\n  ·45 |  6364099 |    7138858   ||·86 | 4217658  |   4731113\r\n  ·46 |  6294944 |    7061285   ||·87 | 4177613  |   4686192\r\n  ·47 |  6226989 |    6985058   ||·88 | 4137974  |   4641728\r\n  ·48 |  6160190 |    6910126   ||·89 | 4098737  |   4597713\r\n  ·49 |  6094510 |    6836450   ||·90 | 4059893  |   4554140\r\n  ·50 |  6029916 |    6763992   ||    |          |\r\n  ————+——————————+——————————————++————+——————————+———————————————\r\n\r\n\r\n[Pg520] In engines which work without expansion we have\r\n\r\n  e′ = a/(1 + c).\r\n\r\nFor condensing engines without expansion, we shall then have\r\n\r\n  e′ = 3875969/1·05 = 3691399;  (33.)\r\n\r\nand for non-condensing engines,\r\n\r\n  e′ = 4347826/1·05 = 4140787.

Making these substitutions in\r\n\r\n  We′ = 33000 H (1 + m) + VA (b + r),\r\n\r\nwe shall have\r\n\r\n  (7/6) × 6029916 = 3300000 × 1·1 + 240 × 1028 × A.\r\n\r\nWhence we find\r\n\r\n  A = 13·8;\r\n\r\nand by the table, p. 520, the corresponding diameter of the\r\ncylinder will be 50-1/3 inches.\r\n\r\nIf P′ be the full pressure of the steam, we shall have, by (18.),\r\n\r\n  P′ = (Wa/VA(e + c)) − b.\r\n\r\nMaking in this the proper substitutions, we have\r\n\r\n  P′ = ((7/6) × 3875969) / (240 × 13·8 × 0·55) − 164 = 2318;\r\n\r\nwhich being in pounds per square foot, the pressure per square\r\ninch will be 16-1/10 lbs.\r\n\r\n  FOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n  [40] M. de Pambour states that the increased volume is 1364\r\n  cubic inches.\r\n\r\n  [41] Formulæ equivalent to some of the preceding are given,\r\n  with numerous others, by M. de Pambour, in his Theory of the\r\n  Steam Engine. These mathematical details contain nothing new\r\n  in principle, being merely the application of the known\r\n  principles of general mechanics to this particular machine. M.\r\n  de Pambour objects against the methods of calculating the\r\n  practical effects of steam engines generally adopted by\r\n  engineers in this country. Their estimates of the loss of\r\n  power by friction, imperfect condensation, and other causes,\r\n  are, as I have stated in this volume, vague, and can be\r\n  regarded at best as very rough approximations; but, subject to\r\n  the restrictions under which their methods of calculation are\r\n  always applied, they are by no means so defective as M. de\r\n  Pambour supposes. He proves what he considers to be their\r\n  inaccuracy, by applying them in cases in which they are never\r\n  intended to be applied by English engineers. Those who desire\r\n  to reduce to general algebraical formulæ the effects of the\r\n  different kinds of steam engines will, however, find the\r\n  volume of M. de Pambour of considerable use.\r\n\r\n[Pg523]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Air, elasticity of, 28;\r\n    May be partially expelled from a vessel by the application of\r\n      heat, 44.\r\n\r\n  America, steam

SPOTTISWOODE,\r\nNew-Street-Square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's endnote:\r\n\r\n  Original spelling and grammar has mostly been retained. For\r\n  example, the forms \"Cyclopoedia\", \"cyclopædia\", \"Encyclopædia\",\r\n  \"Encyclopoedia\", \"guage\", and \"gauge\" are all retained. Figures\r\n  were moved from within paragraphs to between paragraphs.\r\n  Footnotes were re-indexed and moved to the ends of chapters.\r\n\r\n  An entry for the INDEX was inserted into the Table of Contents.\r\n\r\n  In the Table of Contents, changed \"MM. Dulong and Arrago\" to \"MM\r\n  Dulong and Arago\". Also \"Blinkinsop\" to \"Blinkensop\". Also\r\n  \"Wasborough's\" to \"Wasbrough's\".\r\n\r\n  Figs. 4, 5 and 6 are all in one image. Two tubes in Fig. 4\r\n  were incorrectly labeled T'; one of these has been crossed out\r\n  and changed to T. Both tubes in Fig. 6 were incorrectly\r\n  labeled G. One of these was crossed out and replaced by G'.\r\n  Note also that Figs. 4, 5, 6 are repeated in the text on\r\n  different pages; this feature has been retained.\r\n\r\n  Page 10: \"it s already\" to \"it is already\".\r\n\r\n  Page 43: \"Thu if heat\" changed to \"Thus if heat\".\r\n\r\n  Page 45: \"had a diameter of only one square foot\" changed to\r\n  \"had a diameter of only one foot\".\r\n\r\n  Page 47: \"immedate\" to \"immediate\".\r\n\r\n  Page 51: \"a a level\" to \"a level\". Also, comma removed from \"A\r\n  gauge, pipe is inserted\".\r\n\r\n  Page 53: \"proportionably\" to \"proportionally\".\r\n\r\n  Page 79: A paragraph beginning \"He was not fourteen\" contains three\r\n  double quotation marks; this is presumably an error. Possibly there\r\n  should be two double quotation marks and two single quotation\r\n  marks.\r\n\r\n  Page 80: \"S'. Gravesande\" is retained, although this probably\r\n  refers to a person known as \"'s Gravesande\".\r\n\r\n  Page 103: \"gases n general\" to \"gases in general\".\r\n\r\n  Page 122: comma removed from \"process may, be continued\".\r\n\r\n  Page 123: \"two thin pipes F G of tin\" to \"two thin pipes F, G\r\n  of tin\".\r\n\r\n  Page 172: \"empyrical\" to \"empirical\".\r\n\r\n  Page 187, Fig. 32.: The text refers to \"end I of the\r\n  connecting rod\", but this was labeled L on the Figure. This L\r\n  has been crossed out and replaced by I.\r\n\r\n  Page 285: In \"surrounding the boiler with iron-conducting\r\n  substances\", changed \"iron-\" to \"non-\".\r\n\r\n  Page 308: \"exeitement\" to \"excitement\".\r\n\r\n  Page 362: \"acomplish\" to \"accomplish\".\r\n\r\n  There were several extended quotations, for example beginning on\r\n  page 312, in which each line began with a quotation mark, with\r\n  ending quotation marks at the end of each paragraph. In this\r\n  edition, these passages have been marked by indentation, and all\r\n  but the first and last quotation marks from each paragraph were\r\n  removed.\r\n\r\n  Page 366: Figs. 97-104 appeared originally between pages 385\r\n  and 399, as full-page prints. Numerically, however, they\r\n  belong between Figs. 96 and 105--therefore between pages\r\n  366 and 369. Therefore, they have been moved to a location\r\n  between two paragraphs on page 367.\r\n\r\n  Page 368: \"rivetted\" to \"riveted\".\r\n\r\n  Page 419: \"TREVITHECK'S INVENTION\" changed to \"TREVETHICK'S\r\n  INVENTION\", in the chapter heading. However, the references to\r\n  Trevethick occur in a previous chapter, around page 324.\r\n\r\n  Page 468: Period added to end sentence \"[...] piston is at the\r\n  bottom of its stroke\".\r\n\r\n  Page 490: Period added to end sentence \"[...] therefore one\r\n  eighth of its capacity\".\r\n\r\n  Pages 494, 497: large data tables were split into two pieces\r\n  each.\r\n\r\n  Page 505: The logarithm originally given as log x =\r\n  \"[=1]·82340688193\", where \"[=1]\" represents a numeral one with\r\n  a horizontal line over it, is herein changed to log x =\r\n  \"0·82340688193 - 1\", as that is the meaning of this convention.\r\n\r\n  Page 513 \"formulæ are hyberbolic\" to \"formulæ are hyperbolic\".\r\n\r\n  In the Appendix, pp 505-522, mathematical variables such as\r\n  \"a\", \"p\", \"t\", etc. were originally italicized. In these text\r\n  file versions, italicized variables have been removed from this\r\n  section of the book. This rule has two unfortunate exceptions:\r\n  E, _E_, E', and _E'_ on pp 512-515 are different variables, and\r\n  have been retained. Italics have been removed from tables\r\n  throughout the work.\r\n\r\n  The tables on page 494 and 497 were divided into two parts,\r\n  better to fit the width constraints of this format. Most of the\r\n  tables will not look good unless viewed with a monospace font,\r\n  such as Courier New or Lucida Console.",
