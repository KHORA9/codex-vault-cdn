To many this may seem an\r\nimpossibility; but those who knew my father will understand how it was\r\nnot only possible, but natural. The autobiography bears the heading,\r\n‘Recollections of the Development of my Mind and Character,’ and end\r\nwith the following note:—“Aug. 3, 1876. This sketch of my life was\r\nbegun about May 28th at Hopedene (Mr. Hensleigh Wedgwood’s house in\r\nSurrey.), and since then I have written for nearly an hour on most\r\nafternoons.” It will easily be understood that, in a narrative of a\r\npersonal and intimate kind written for his wife and children, passages\r\nshould occur which must here be omitted; and I have not thought it\r\nnecessary to indicate where such omissions are made. It has been found\r\nnecessary to make a few corrections of obvious verbal slips, but the\r\nnumber of such alterations has been kept down to the minimum.—F.D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA German Editor having written to me for an account of the development\r\nof my mind and character with some sketch of my autobiography, I have\r\nthought that the attempt would amuse me, and might possibly interest my\r\nchildren or their children. I know that it would have interested me\r\ngreatly to have read even so short and dull a sketch of the mind of my\r\ngrandfather, written by himself, and what he thought and did, and how\r\nhe worked. I have attempted to write the following account of myself,\r\nas if I were a dead man in another world looking back at my own life.\r\nNor have I found this difficult, for life is nearly over with me. I\r\nhave taken no pains about my style of writing.\r\n\r\nI was born at Shrewsbury on February 12th, 1809, and my earliest\r\nrecollection goes back only to when I was a few months over four years\r\nold, when we went to near Abergele for sea-bathing, and I recollect\r\nsome events and places there with some little distinctness.\r\n\r\nMy mother died in July 1817, when I was a little over eight years old,\r\nand it is odd that I can remember hardly anything about her except her\r\ndeath-bed, her black velvet gown, and her curiously constructed\r\nwork-table. In the spring of this same year I was sent to a day-school\r\nin Shrewsbury, where I stayed a year. I have been told that I was much\r\nslower in learning than my younger sister Catherine, and I believe that\r\nI was in many ways a naughty boy.\r\n\r\nBy the time I went to this day-school (Kept by Rev. G. Case, minister\r\nof the Unitarian Chapel in the High Street. Mrs. Darwin was a Unitarian\r\nand attended Mr. Case’s chapel, and my father as a little boy went\r\nthere with his elder sisters. But both he and his brother were\r\nchristened and intended to belong to the Church of England; and after\r\nhis early boyhood he seems usually to have gone to church and not to\r\nMr. Case’s. It appears (“St. James’ Gazette”, Dec. 15, 1883) that a\r\nmural tablet has been erected to his memory in the chapel, which is now\r\nknown as the ‘Free Christian Church.’) my taste for natural history,\r\nand more especially for collecting, was well developed. I tried to make\r\nout the names of plants (Rev. W.A. Leighton, who was a schoolfellow of\r\nmy father’s at Mr. Case’s school, remembers his bringing a flower to\r\nschool and saying that his mother had taught him how by looking at the\r\ninside of the blossom the name of the plant could be discovered. Mr.\r\nLeighton goes on, “This greatly roused my attention and curiosity, and\r\nI enquired of him repeatedly how this could be done?”—but his lesson\r\nwas naturally enough not transmissible.—F.D.), and collected all sorts\r\nof things, shells, seals, franks, coins, and minerals. The passion for\r\ncollecting which leads a man to be a systematic naturalist, a virtuoso,\r\nor a miser, was very strong in me, and was clearly innate, as none of\r\nmy sisters or brother ever had this taste.\r\n\r\nOne little event during this year has fixed itself very firmly in my\r\nmind, and I hope that it has done so from my conscience having been\r\nafterwards sorely troubled by it; it is curious as showing that\r\napparently I was interested at this early age in the variability of\r\nplants! I told another little boy (I believe it was Leighton, who\r\nafterwards became a well-known lichenologist and botanist), that I\r\ncould produce variously coloured polyanthuses and primroses by watering\r\nthem with certain coloured fluids, which was of course a monstrous\r\nfable, and had never been tried by me. I may here also confess that as\r\na little boy I was much given to inventing deliberate falsehoods, and\r\nthis was always done for the sake of causing excitement. For instance,\r\nI once gathered much valuable fruit from my father’s trees and hid it\r\nin the shrubbery, and then ran in breathless haste to spread the news\r\nthat I had discovered a hoard of stolen fruit.\r\n\r\nI must have been a very simple little fellow when I first went to the\r\nschool. A boy of the name of Garnett took me into a cake shop one day,\r\nand bought some cakes for which he did not pay, as the shopman trusted\r\nhim. When we came out I asked him why he did not pay for them, and he\r\ninstantly answered, “Why, do you not know that my uncle left a great\r\nsum of money to the town on condition that every tradesman should give\r\nwhatever was wanted without payment to any one who wore his old hat and\r\nmoved [it] in a particular manner?” and he then showed me how it was\r\nmoved. He then went into another shop where he was trusted, and asked\r\nfor some small article, moving his hat in the proper manner, and of\r\ncourse obtained it without payment. When we came out he said, “Now if\r\nyou like to go by yourself into that cake-shop (how well I remember its\r\nexact position) I will lend you my hat, and you can get whatever you\r\nlike if you move the hat on your head properly.” I gladly accepted the\r\ngenerous offer, and went in and asked for some cakes, moved the old hat\r\nand was walking out of the shop, when the shopman made a rush at me, so\r\nI dropped the cakes and ran for dear life, and was astonished by being\r\ngreeted with shouts of laughter by my false friend Garnett.\r\n\r\nI can say in my own favour that I was as a boy humane, but I owed this\r\nentirely to the instruction and example of my sisters. I doubt indeed\r\nwhether humanity is a natural or innate quality. I was very fond of\r\ncollecting eggs, but I never took more than a single egg out of a\r\nbird’s nest, except on one single occasion, when I took all, not for\r\ntheir value, but from a sort of bravado.\r\n\r\nI had a strong taste for angling, and would sit for any number of hours\r\non the bank of a river or pond watching the float; when at Maer (The\r\nhouse of his uncle, Josiah Wedgwood.) I was told that I could kill the\r\nworms with salt and water, and from that day I never spitted a living\r\nworm, though at the expense probably of some loss of success.\r\n\r\nOnce as a very little boy whilst at the day school, or before that\r\ntime, I acted cruelly, for I beat a puppy, I believe, simply from\r\nenjoying the sense of power; but the beating could not have been\r\nsevere, for the puppy did not howl, of which I feel sure, as the spot\r\nwas near the house. This act lay heavily on my conscience, as is shown\r\nby my remembering the exact spot where the crime was committed. It\r\nprobably lay all the heavier from my love of dogs being then, and for a\r\nlong time afterwards, a passion. Dogs seemed to know this, for I was an\r\nadept in robbing their love from their masters.\r\n\r\nI remember clearly only one other incident during this year whilst at\r\nMr. Case’s daily school,—namely, the burial of a dragoon soldier; and\r\nit is surprising how clearly I can still see the horse with the man’s\r\nempty boots and carbine suspended to the saddle, and the firing over\r\nthe grave. This scene deeply stirred whatever poetic fancy there was in\r\nme.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1818 I went to Dr. Butler’s great school in\r\nShrewsbury, and remained there for seven years till Midsummer 1825,\r\nwhen I was sixteen years old. I boarded at this school, so that I had\r\nthe great advantage of living the life of a true schoolboy; but as the\r\ndistance was hardly more than a mile to my home, I very often ran there\r\nin the longer intervals between the callings over and before locking up\r\nat night. This, I think, was in many ways advantageous to me by keeping\r\nup home affections and interests. I remember in the early part of my\r\nschool life that I often had to run very quickly to be in time, and\r\nfrom being a fleet runner was generally successful; but when in doubt I\r\nprayed earnestly to God to help me, and I well remember that I\r\nattributed my success to the prayers and not to my quick running, and\r\nmarvelled how generally I was aided.\r\n\r\nI have heard my father and elder sister say that I had, as a very young\r\nboy, a strong taste for long solitary walks; but what I thought about I\r\nknow not. I often became quite absorbed, and once, whilst returning to\r\nschool on the summit of the old fortifications round Shrewsbury, which\r\nhad been converted into a public foot-path with no parapet on one side,\r\nI walked off and fell to the ground, but the height was only seven or\r\neight feet. Nevertheless the number of thoughts which passed through my\r\nmind during this very short, but sudden and wholly unexpected fall, was\r\nastonishing, and seem hardly compatible with what physiologists have, I\r\nbelieve, proved about each thought requiring quite an appreciable\r\namount of time.\r\n\r\nNothing could have been worse for the development of my mind than Dr.\r\nButler’s school, as it was strictly classical, nothing else being\r\ntaught, except a little ancient geography and history. The school as a\r\nmeans of education to me was simply a blank. During my whole life I\r\nhave been singularly incapable of mastering any language. Especial\r\nattention was paid to verse-making, and this I could never do well. I\r\nhad many friends, and got together a good collection of old verses,\r\nwhich by patching together, sometimes aided by other boys, I could work\r\ninto any subject. Much attention was paid to learning by heart the\r\nlessons of the previous day; this I could effect with great facility,\r\nlearning forty or fifty lines of Virgil or Homer, whilst I was in\r\nmorning chapel; but this exercise was utterly useless, for every verse\r\nwas forgotten in forty-eight hours. I was not idle, and with the\r\nexception of versification, generally worked conscientiously at my\r\nclassics, not using cribs. The sole pleasure I ever received from such\r\nstudies, was from some of the odes of Horace, which I admired greatly.\r\n\r\nWhen I left the school I was for my age neither high nor low in it; and\r\nI believe that I was considered by all my masters and by my father as a\r\nvery ordinary boy, rather below the common standard in intellect. To my\r\ndeep mortification my father once said to me, “You care for nothing but\r\nshooting, dogs, and rat-catching, and you will be a disgrace to\r\nyourself and all your family.” But my father, who was the kindest man I\r\never knew and whose memory I love with all my heart, must have been\r\nangry and somewhat unjust when he used such words.\r\n\r\nLooking back as well as I can at my character during my school life,\r\nthe only qualities which at this period promised well for the future,\r\nwere, that I had strong and diversified tastes, much zeal for whatever\r\ninterested me, and a keen pleasure in understanding any complex subject\r\nor thing. I was taught Euclid by a private tutor, and I distinctly\r\nremember the intense satisfaction which the clear geometrical proofs\r\ngave me. I remember, with equal distinctness, the delight which my\r\nuncle gave me (the father of Francis Galton) by explaining the\r\nprinciple of the vernier of a barometer with respect to diversified\r\ntastes, independently of science, I was fond of reading various books,\r\nand I used to sit for hours reading the historical plays of\r\nShakespeare, generally in an old window in the thick walls of the\r\nschool. I read also other poetry, such as Thomson’s ‘Seasons,’ and the\r\nrecently published poems of Byron and Scott. I mention this because\r\nlater in life I wholly lost, to my great regret, all pleasure from\r\npoetry of any kind, including Shakespeare. In connection with pleasure\r\nfrom poetry, I may add that in 1822 a vivid delight in scenery was\r\nfirst awakened in my mind, during a riding tour on the borders of\r\nWales, and this has lasted longer than any other aesthetic pleasure.\r\n\r\nEarly in my school days a boy had a copy of the ‘Wonders of the World,’\r\nwhich I often read, and disputed with other boys about the veracity of\r\nsome of the statements; and I believe that this book first gave me a\r\nwish to travel in remote countries, which was ultimately fulfilled by\r\nthe voyage of the “Beagle”. In the latter part of my school life I\r\nbecame passionately fond of shooting; I do not believe that any one\r\ncould have shown more zeal for the most holy cause than I did for\r\nshooting birds. How well I remember killing my first snipe, and my\r\nexcitement was so great that I had much difficulty in reloading my gun\r\nfrom the trembling of my hands. This taste long continued, and I became\r\na very good shot. When at Cambridge I used to practise throwing up my\r\ngun to my shoulder before a looking-glass to see that I threw it up\r\nstraight. Another and better plan was to get a friend to wave about a\r\nlighted candle, and then to fire at it with a cap on the nipple, and if\r\nthe aim was accurate the little puff of air would blow out the candle.\r\nThe explosion of the cap caused a sharp crack, and I was told that the\r\ntutor of the college remarked, “What an extraordinary thing it is, Mr.\r\nDarwin seems to spend hours in cracking a horse-whip in his room, for I\r\noften hear the crack when I pass under his windows.”\r\n\r\nI had many friends amongst the schoolboys, whom I loved dearly, and I\r\nthink that my disposition was then very affectionate.\r\n\r\nWith respect to science, I continued collecting minerals with much\r\nzeal, but quite unscientifically—all that I cared about was a\r\nnew-_named_ mineral, and I hardly attempted to classify them. I must\r\nhave observed insects with some little care, for when ten years old\r\n(1819) I went for three weeks to Plas Edwards on the sea-coast in\r\nWales, I was very much interested and surprised at seeing a large black\r\nand scarlet Hemipterous insect, many moths (Zygaena), and a Cicindela\r\nwhich are not found in Shropshire. I almost made up my mind to begin\r\ncollecting all the insects which I could find dead, for on consulting\r\nmy sister I concluded that it was not right to kill insects for the\r\nsake of making a collection. From reading White’s ‘Selborne,’ I took\r\nmuch pleasure in watching the habits of birds, and even made notes on\r\nthe subject. In my simplicity I remember wondering why every gentleman\r\ndid not become an ornithologist.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of my school life, my brother worked hard at\r\nchemistry, and made a fair laboratory with proper apparatus in the\r\ntool-house in the garden, and I was allowed to aid him as a servant in\r\nmost of his experiments. He made all the gases and many compounds, and\r\nI read with great care several books on chemistry, such as Henry and\r\nParkes’ ‘Chemical Catechism.’ The subject interested me greatly, and we\r\noften used to go on working till rather late at night. This was the\r\nbest part of my education at school, for it showed me practically the\r\nmeaning of experimental science. The fact that we worked at chemistry\r\nsomehow got known at school, and as it was an unprecedented fact, I was\r\nnicknamed “Gas.” I was also once publicly rebuked by the head-master,\r\nDr. Butler, for thus wasting my time on such useless subjects; and he\r\ncalled me very unjustly a “poco curante,” and as I did not understand\r\nwhat he meant, it seemed to me a fearful reproach.\r\n\r\nAs I was doing no good at school, my father wisely took me away at a\r\nrather earlier age than usual, and sent me (Oct. 1825) to Edinburgh\r\nUniversity with my brother, where I stayed for two years or sessions.\r\nMy brother was completing his medical studies, though I do not believe\r\nhe ever really intended to practise, and I was sent there to commence\r\nthem. But soon after this period I became convinced from various small\r\ncircumstances that my father would leave me property enough to subsist\r\non with some comfort, though I never imagined that I should be so rich\r\na man as I am; but my belief was sufficient to check any strenuous\r\nefforts to learn medicine.\r\n\r\nThe instruction at Edinburgh was altogether by lectures, and these were\r\nintolerably dull, with the exception of those on chemistry by Hope; but\r\nto my mind there are no advantages and many disadvantages in lectures\r\ncompared with reading. Dr. Duncan’s lectures on Materia Medica at 8\r\no’clock on a winter’s morning are something fearful to remember. Dr.——\r\nmade his lectures on human anatomy as dull as he was himself, and the\r\nsubject disgusted me. It has proved one of the greatest evils in my\r\nlife that I was not urged to practise dissection, for I should soon\r\nhave got over my disgust; and the practice would have been invaluable\r\nfor all my future work. This has been an irremediable evil, as well as\r\nmy incapacity to draw. I also attended regularly the clinical wards in\r\nthe hospital. Some of the cases distressed me a good deal, and I still\r\nhave vivid pictures before me of some of them; but I was not so foolish\r\nas to allow this to lessen my attendance. I cannot understand why this\r\npart of my medical course did not interest me in a greater degree; for\r\nduring the summer before coming to Edinburgh I began attending some of\r\nthe poor people, chiefly children and women in Shrewsbury: I wrote down\r\nas full an account as I could of the case with all the symptoms, and\r\nread them aloud to my father, who suggested further inquiries and\r\nadvised me what medicines to give, which I made up myself. At one time\r\nI had at least a dozen patients, and I felt a keen interest in the\r\nwork. My father, who was by far the best judge of character whom I ever\r\nknew, declared that I should make a successful physician,—meaning by\r\nthis one who would get many patients. He maintained that the chief\r\nelement of success was exciting confidence; but what he saw in me which\r\nconvinced him that I should create confidence I know not. I also\r\nattended on two occasions the operating theatre in the hospital at\r\nEdinburgh, and saw two very bad operations, one on a child, but I\r\nrushed away before they were completed. Nor did I ever attend again,\r\nfor hardly any inducement would have been strong enough to make me do\r\nso; this being long before the blessed days of chloroform. The two\r\ncases fairly haunted me for many a long year.\r\n\r\nMy brother stayed only one year at the University, so that during the\r\nsecond year I was left to my own resources; and this was an advantage,\r\nfor I became well acquainted with several young men fond of natural\r\nscience. One of these was Ainsworth, who afterwards published his\r\ntravels in Assyria; he was a Wernerian geologist, and knew a little\r\nabout many subjects. Dr. Coldstream was a very different young man,\r\nprim, formal, highly religious, and most kind-hearted; he afterwards\r\npublished some good zoological articles. A third young man was Hardie,\r\nwho would, I think, have made a good botanist, but died early in India.\r\nLastly, Dr. Grant, my senior by several years, but how I became\r\nacquainted with him I cannot remember; he published some first-rate\r\nzoological papers, but after coming to London as Professor in\r\nUniversity College, he did nothing more in science, a fact which has\r\nalways been inexplicable to me. I knew him well; he was dry and formal\r\nin manner, with much enthusiasm beneath this outer crust. He one day,\r\nwhen we were walking together, burst forth in high admiration of\r\nLamarck and his views on evolution. I listened in silent astonishment,\r\nand as far as I can judge without any effect on my mind. I had\r\npreviously read the ‘Zoonomia’ of my grandfather, in which similar\r\nviews are maintained, but without producing any effect on me.\r\nNevertheless it is probable that the hearing rather early in life such\r\nviews maintained and praised may have favoured my upholding them under\r\na different form in my ‘Origin of Species.’ At this time I admired\r\ngreatly the ‘Zoonomia;’ but on reading it a second time after an\r\ninterval of ten or fifteen years, I was much disappointed; the\r\nproportion of speculation being so large to the facts given.\r\n\r\nDrs. Grant and Coldstream attended much to marine Zoology, and I often\r\naccompanied the former to collect animals in the tidal pools, which I\r\ndissected as well as I could. I also became friends with some of the\r\nNewhaven fishermen, and sometimes accompanied them when they trawled\r\nfor oysters, and thus got many specimens. But from not having had any\r\nregular practice in dissection, and from possessing only a wretched\r\nmicroscope, my attempts were very poor. Nevertheless I made one\r\ninteresting little discovery, and read, about the beginning of the year\r\n1826, a short paper on the subject before the Plinian Society. This was\r\nthat the so-called ova of Flustra had the power of independent movement\r\nby means of cilia, and were in fact larvae. In another short paper I\r\nshowed that the little globular bodies which had been supposed to be\r\nthe young state of Fucus loreus were the egg-cases of the wormlike\r\nPontobdella muricata.\r\n\r\nThe Plinian Society was encouraged and, I believe, founded by Professor\r\nJameson: it consisted of students and met in an underground room in the\r\nUniversity for the sake of reading papers on natural science and\r\ndiscussing them. I used regularly to attend, and the meetings had a\r\ngood effect on me in stimulating my zeal and giving me new congenial\r\nacquaintances. One evening a poor young man got up, and after\r\nstammering for a prodigious length of time, blushing crimson, he at\r\nlast slowly got out the words, “Mr. President, I have forgotten what I\r\nwas going to say.” The poor fellow looked quite overwhelmed, and all\r\nthe members were so surprised that no one could think of a word to say\r\nto cover his confusion. The papers which were read to our little\r\nsociety were not printed, so that I had not the satisfaction of seeing\r\nmy paper in print; but I believe Dr. Grant noticed my small discovery\r\nin his excellent memoir on Flustra.\r\n\r\nI was also a member of the Royal Medical Society, and attended pretty\r\nregularly; but as the subjects were exclusively medical, I did not much\r\ncare about them. Much rubbish was talked there, but there were some\r\ngood speakers, of whom the best was the present Sir J.\r\nKay-Shuttleworth. Dr. Grant took me occasionally to the meetings of the\r\nWernerian Society, where various papers on natural history were read,\r\ndiscussed, and afterwards published in the ‘Transactions.’ I heard\r\nAudubon deliver there some interesting discourses on the habits of N.\r\nAmerican birds, sneering somewhat unjustly at Waterton. By the way, a\r\nnegro lived in Edinburgh, who had travelled with Waterton, and gained\r\nhis livelihood by stuffing birds, which he did excellently: he gave me\r\nlessons for payment, and I used often to sit with him, for he was a\r\nvery pleasant and intelligent man.\r\n\r\nMr. Leonard Horner also took me once to a meeting of the Royal Society\r\nof Edinburgh, where I saw Sir Walter Scott in the chair as President,\r\nand he apologised to the meeting as not feeling fitted for such a\r\nposition. I looked at him and at the whole scene with some awe and\r\nreverence, and I think it was owing to this visit during my youth, and\r\nto my having attended the Royal Medical Society, that I felt the honour\r\nof being elected a few years ago an honorary member of both these\r\nSocieties, more than any other similar honour. If I had been told at\r\nthat time that I should one day have been thus honoured, I declare that\r\nI should have thought it as ridiculous and improbable, as if I had been\r\ntold that I should be elected King of England.\r\n\r\nDuring my second year at Edinburgh I attended ——’s lectures on Geology\r\nand Zoology, but they were incredibly dull. The sole effect they\r\nproduced on me was the determination never as long as I lived to read a\r\nbook on Geology, or in any way to study the science. Yet I feel sure\r\nthat I was prepared for a philosophical treatment of the subject; for\r\nan old Mr. Cotton in Shropshire, who knew a good deal about rocks, had\r\npointed out to me two or three years previously a well-known large\r\nerratic boulder in the town of Shrewsbury, called the “bell-stone”; he\r\ntold me that there was no rock of the same kind nearer than Cumberland\r\nor Scotland, and he solemnly assured me that the world would come to an\r\nend before any one would be able to explain how this stone came where\r\nit now lay. This produced a deep impression on me, and I meditated over\r\nthis wonderful stone. So that I felt the keenest delight when I first\r\nread of the action of icebergs in transporting boulders, and I gloried\r\nin the progress of Geology. Equally striking is the fact that I, though\r\nnow only sixty-seven years old, heard the Professor, in a field lecture\r\nat Salisbury Craigs, discoursing on a trapdyke, with amygdaloidal\r\nmargins and the strata indurated on each side, with volcanic rocks all\r\naround us, say that it was a fissure filled with sediment from above,\r\nadding with a sneer that there were men who maintained that it had been\r\ninjected from beneath in a molten condition. When I think of this\r\nlecture, I do not wonder that I determined never to attend to Geology.\r\n\r\nFrom attending ——’s lectures, I became acquainted with the curator of\r\nthe museum, Mr. Macgillivray, who afterwards published a large and\r\nexcellent book on the birds of Scotland. I had much interesting\r\nnatural-history talk with him, and he was very kind to me. He gave me\r\nsome rare shells, for I at that time collected marine mollusca, but\r\nwith no great zeal.\r\n\r\nMy summer vacations during these two years were wholly given up to\r\namusements, though I always had some book in hand, which I read with\r\ninterest. During the summer of 1826 I took a long walking tour with two\r\nfriends with knapsacks on our backs through North Wales. We walked\r\nthirty miles most days, including one day the ascent of Snowdon. I also\r\nwent with my sister a riding tour in North Wales, a servant with\r\nsaddle-bags carrying our clothes. The autumns were devoted to shooting\r\nchiefly at Mr. Owen’s, at Woodhouse, and at my Uncle Jos’s (Josiah\r\nWedgwood, the son of the founder of the Etruria Works.) at Maer. My\r\nzeal was so great that I used to place my shooting-boots open by my\r\nbed-side when I went to bed, so as not to lose half a minute in putting\r\nthem on in the morning; and on one occasion I reached a distant part of\r\nthe Maer estate, on the 20th of August for black-game shooting, before\r\nI could see: I then toiled on with the game-keeper the whole day\r\nthrough thick heath and young Scotch firs.\r\n\r\nI kept an exact record of every bird which I shot throughout the whole\r\nseason. One day when shooting at Woodhouse with Captain Owen, the\r\neldest son, and Major Hill, his cousin, afterwards Lord Berwick, both\r\nof whom I liked very much, I thought myself shamefully used, for every\r\ntime after I had fired and thought that I had killed a bird, one of the\r\ntwo acted as if loading his gun, and cried out, “You must not count\r\nthat bird, for I fired at the same time,” and the gamekeeper,\r\nperceiving the joke, backed them up. After some hours they told me the\r\njoke, but it was no joke to me, for I had shot a large number of birds,\r\nbut did not know how many, and could not add them to my list, which I\r\nused to do by making a knot in a piece of string tied to a button-hole.\r\nThis my wicked friends had perceived.\r\n\r\nHow I did enjoy shooting! But I think that I must have been\r\nhalf-consciously ashamed of my zeal, for I tried to persuade myself\r\nthat shooting was almost an intellectual employment; it required so\r\nmuch skill to judge where to find most game and to hunt the dogs well.\r\n\r\nOne of my autumnal visits to Maer in 1827 was memorable from meeting\r\nthere Sir J. Mackintosh, who was the best converser I ever listened to.\r\nI heard afterwards with a glow of pride that he had said, “There is\r\nsomething in that young man that interests me.” This must have been\r\nchiefly due to his perceiving that I listened with much interest to\r\neverything which he said, for I was as ignorant as a pig about his\r\nsubjects of history, politics, and moral philosophy. To hear of praise\r\nfrom an eminent person, though no doubt apt or certain to excite\r\nvanity, is, I think, good for a young man, as it helps to keep him in\r\nthe right course.\r\n\r\nMy visits to Maer during these two or three succeeding years were quite\r\ndelightful, independently of the autumnal shooting. Life there was\r\nperfectly free; the country was very pleasant for walking or riding;\r\nand in the evening there was much very agreeable conversation, not so\r\npersonal as it generally is in large family parties, together with\r\nmusic. In the summer the whole family used often to sit on the steps of\r\nthe old portico, with the flower-garden in front, and with the steep\r\nwooded bank opposite the house reflected in the lake, with here and\r\nthere a fish rising or a water-bird paddling about. Nothing has left a\r\nmore vivid picture on my mind than these evenings at Maer. I was also\r\nattached to and greatly revered my Uncle Jos; he was silent and\r\nreserved, so as to be a rather awful man; but he sometimes talked\r\nopenly with me. He was the very type of an upright man, with the\r\nclearest judgment. I do not believe that any power on earth could have\r\nmade him swerve an inch from what he considered the right course. I\r\nused to apply to him in my mind the well-known ode of Horace, now\r\nforgotten by me, in which the words “nec vultus tyranni,* etc.,” come\r\nin.\r\n\r\n* Justum et tenacem propositi virum\r\nNon civium ardor prava jubentium\r\nNon vultus instantis tyranni\r\nMente quatit solida.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE 1828-1831.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having spent two sessions in Edinburgh, my father perceived, or\r\nhe heard from my sisters, that I did not like the thought of being a\r\nphysician, so he proposed that I should become a clergyman. He was very\r\nproperly vehement against my turning into an idle sporting man, which\r\nthen seemed my probable destination. I asked for some time to consider,\r\nas from what little I had heard or thought on the subject I had\r\nscruples about declaring my belief in all the dogmas of the Church of\r\nEngland; though otherwise I liked the thought of being a country\r\nclergyman. Accordingly I read with care ‘Pearson on the Creed,’ and a\r\nfew other books on divinity; and as I did not then in the least doubt\r\nthe strict and literal truth of every word in the Bible, I soon\r\npersuaded myself that our Creed must be fully accepted.\r\n\r\nConsidering how fiercely I have been attacked by the orthodox, it seems\r\nludicrous that I once intended to be a clergyman. Nor was this\r\nintention and my father’s wish ever formerly given up, but died a\r\nnatural death when, on leaving Cambridge, I joined the “Beagle” as\r\nnaturalist. If the phrenologists are to be trusted, I was well fitted\r\nin one respect to be a clergyman. A few years ago the secretaries of a\r\nGerman psychological society asked me earnestly by letter for a\r\nphotograph of myself; and some time afterwards I received the\r\nproceedings of one of the meetings, in which it seemed that the shape\r\nof my head had been the subject of a public discussion, and one of the\r\nspeakers declared that I had the bump of reverence developed enough for\r\nten priests.\r\n\r\nAs it was decided that I should be a clergyman, it was necessary that I\r\nshould go to one of the English universities and take a degree; but as\r\nI had never opened a classical book since leaving school, I found to my\r\ndismay, that in the two intervening years I had actually forgotten,\r\nincredible as it may appear, almost everything which I had learnt, even\r\nto some few of the Greek letters. I did not therefore proceed to\r\nCambridge at the usual time in October, but worked with a private tutor\r\nin Shrewsbury, and went to Cambridge after the Christmas vacation,\r\nearly in 1828. I soon recovered my school standard of knowledge, and\r\ncould translate easy Greek books, such as Homer and the Greek\r\nTestament, with moderate facility.\r\n\r\nDuring the three years which I spent at Cambridge my time was wasted,\r\nas far as the academical studies were concerned, as completely as at\r\nEdinburgh and at school. I attempted mathematics, and even went during\r\nthe summer of 1828 with a private tutor (a very dull man) to Barmouth,\r\nbut I got on very slowly. The work was repugnant to me, chiefly from my\r\nnot being able to see any meaning in the early steps in algebra. This\r\nimpatience was very foolish, and in after years I have deeply regretted\r\nthat I did not proceed far enough at least to understand something of\r\nthe great leading principles of mathematics, for men thus endowed seem\r\nto have an extra sense. But I do not believe that I should ever have\r\nsucceeded beyond a very low grade. With respect to Classics I did\r\nnothing except attend a few compulsory college lectures, and the\r\nattendance was almost nominal. In my second year I had to work for a\r\nmonth or two to pass the Little-Go, which I did easily. Again, in my\r\nlast year I worked with some earnestness for my final degree of B.A.,\r\nand brushed up my Classics, together with a little Algebra and Euclid,\r\nwhich latter gave me much pleasure, as it did at school. In order to\r\npass the B.A. examination, it was also necessary to get up Paley’s\r\n‘Evidences of Christianity,’ and his ‘Moral Philosophy.’ This was done\r\nin a thorough manner, and I am convinced that I could have written out\r\nthe whole of the ‘Evidences’ with perfect correctness, but not of\r\ncourse in the clear language of Paley. The logic of this book and, as I\r\nmay add, of his ‘Natural Theology,’ gave me as much delight as did\r\nEuclid. The careful study of these works, without attempting to learn\r\nany part by rote, was the only part of the academical course which, as\r\nI then felt and as I still believe, was of the least use to me in the\r\neducation of my mind. I did not at that time trouble myself about\r\nPaley’s premises; and taking these on trust, I was charmed and\r\nconvinced by the long line of argumentation. By answering well the\r\nexamination questions in Paley, by doing Euclid well, and by not\r\nfailing miserably in Classics, I gained a good place among the oi\r\npolloi or crowd of men who do not go in for honours. Oddly enough, I\r\ncannot remember how high I stood, and my memory fluctuates between the\r\nfifth, tenth, or twelfth, name on the list. (Tenth in the list of\r\nJanuary 1831.)\r\n\r\nPublic lectures on several branches were given in the University,\r\nattendance being quite voluntary; but I was so sickened with lectures\r\nat Edinburgh that I did not even attend Sedgwick’s eloquent and\r\ninteresting lectures. Had I done so I should probably have become a\r\ngeologist earlier than I did. I attended, however, Henslow’s lectures\r\non Botany, and liked them much for their extreme clearness, and the\r\nadmirable illustrations; but I did not study botany. Henslow used to\r\ntake his pupils, including several of the older members of the\r\nUniversity, field excursions, on foot or in coaches, to distant places,\r\nor in a barge down the river, and lectured on the rarer plants and\r\nanimals which were observed. These excursions were delightful.\r\n\r\nAlthough, as we shall presently see, there were some redeeming features\r\nin my life at Cambridge, my time was sadly wasted there, and worse than\r\nwasted. From my passion for shooting and for hunting, and, when this\r\nfailed, for riding across country, I got into a sporting set, including\r\nsome dissipated low-minded young men. We used often to dine together in\r\nthe evening, though these dinners often included men of a higher stamp,\r\nand we sometimes drank too much, with jolly singing and playing at\r\ncards afterwards. I know that I ought to feel ashamed of days and\r\nevenings thus spent, but as some of my friends were very pleasant, and\r\nwe were all in the highest spirits, I cannot help looking back to these\r\ntimes with much pleasure.\r\n\r\nBut I am glad to think that I had many other friends of a widely\r\ndifferent nature. I was very intimate with Whitley (Rev. C. Whitley,\r\nHon. Canon of Durham, formerly Reader in Natural Philosophy in Durham\r\nUniversity.), who was afterwards Senior Wrangler, and we used\r\ncontinually to take long walks together. He inoculated me with a taste\r\nfor pictures and good engravings, of which I bought some. I frequently\r\nwent to the Fitzwilliam Gallery, and my taste must have been fairly\r\ngood, for I certainly admired the best pictures, which I discussed with\r\nthe old curator. I read also with much interest Sir Joshua Reynolds’\r\nbook. This taste, though not natural to me, lasted for several years,\r\nand many of the pictures in the National Gallery in London gave me much\r\npleasure; that of Sebastian del Piombo exciting in me a sense of\r\nsublimity.\r\n\r\nI also got into a musical set, I believe by means of my warm-hearted\r\nfriend, Herbert (The late John Maurice Herbert, County Court Judge of\r\nCardiff and the Monmouth Circuit.), who took a high wrangler’s degree.\r\nFrom associating with these men, and hearing them play, I acquired a\r\nstrong taste for music, and used very often to time my walks so as to\r\nhear on week days the anthem in King’s College Chapel. This gave me\r\nintense pleasure, so that my backbone would sometimes shiver. I am sure\r\nthat there was no affectation or mere imitation in this taste, for I\r\nused generally to go by myself to King’s College, and I sometimes hired\r\nthe chorister boys to sing in my rooms. Nevertheless I am so utterly\r\ndestitute of an ear, that I cannot perceive a discord, or keep time and\r\nhum a tune correctly; and it is a mystery how I could possibly have\r\nderived pleasure from music.\r\n\r\nMy musical friends soon perceived my state, and sometimes amused\r\nthemselves by making me pass an examination, which consisted in\r\nascertaining how many tunes I could recognise when they were played\r\nrather more quickly or slowly than usual. ‘God save the King,’ when\r\nthus played, was a sore puzzle. There was another man with almost as\r\nbad an ear as I had, and strange to say he played a little on the\r\nflute. Once I had the triumph of beating him in one of our musical\r\nexaminations.\r\n\r\nBut no pursuit at Cambridge was followed with nearly so much eagerness\r\nor gave me so much pleasure as collecting beetles. It was the mere\r\npassion for collecting, for I did not dissect them, and rarely compared\r\ntheir external characters with published descriptions, but got them\r\nnamed anyhow. I will give a proof of my zeal: one day, on tearing off\r\nsome old bark, I saw two rare beetles, and seized one in each hand;\r\nthen I saw a third and new kind, which I could not bear to lose, so\r\nthat I popped the one which I held in my right hand into my mouth.\r\nAlas! it ejected some intensely acrid fluid, which burnt my tongue so\r\nthat I was forced to spit the beetle out, which was lost, as was the\r\nthird one.\r\n\r\nI was very successful in collecting, and invented two new methods; I\r\nemployed a labourer to scrape during the winter, moss off old trees and\r\nplace it in a large bag, and likewise to collect the rubbish at the\r\nbottom of the barges in which reeds are brought from the fens, and thus\r\nI got some very rare species. No poet ever felt more delighted at\r\nseeing his first poem published than I did at seeing, in Stephens’\r\n‘Illustrations of British Insects,’ the magic words, “captured by C.\r\nDarwin, Esq.” I was introduced to entomology by my second cousin W.\r\nDarwin Fox, a clever and most pleasant man, who was then at Christ’s\r\nCollege, and with whom I became extremely intimate. Afterwards I became\r\nwell acquainted, and went out collecting, with Albert Way of Trinity,\r\nwho in after years became a well-known archaeologist; also with H.\r\nThompson of the same College, afterwards a leading agriculturist,\r\nchairman of a great railway, and Member of Parliament. It seems\r\ntherefore that a taste for collecting beetles is some indication of\r\nfuture success in life!\r\n\r\nI am surprised what an indelible impression many of the beetles which I\r\ncaught at Cambridge have left on my mind. I can remember the exact\r\nappearance of certain posts, old trees and banks where I made a good\r\ncapture. The pretty Panagaeus crux-major was a treasure in those days,\r\nand here at Down I saw a beetle running across a walk, and on picking\r\nit up instantly perceived that it differed slightly from P. crux-major,\r\nand it turned out to be P. quadripunctatus, which is only a variety or\r\nclosely allied species, differing from it very slightly in outline. I\r\nhad never seen in those old days Licinus alive, which to an uneducated\r\neye hardly differs from many of the black Carabidous beetles; but my\r\nsons found here a specimen, and I instantly recognised that it was new\r\nto me; yet I had not looked at a British beetle for the last twenty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nI have not as yet mentioned a circumstance which influenced my whole\r\ncareer more than any other. This was my friendship with Professor\r\nHenslow. Before coming up to Cambridge, I had heard of him from my\r\nbrother as a man who knew every branch of science, and I was\r\naccordingly prepared to reverence him. He kept open house once every\r\nweek when all undergraduates, and some older members of the University,\r\nwho were attached to science, used to meet in the evening. I soon got,\r\nthrough Fox, an invitation, and went there regularly. Before long I\r\nbecame well acquainted with Henslow, and during the latter half of my\r\ntime at Cambridge took long walks with him on most days; so that I was\r\ncalled by some of the dons “the man who walks with Henslow;” and in the\r\nevening I was very often asked to join his family dinner. His knowledge\r\nwas great in botany, entomology, chemistry, mineralogy, and geology.\r\nHis strongest taste was to draw conclusions from long-continued minute\r\nobservations. His judgment was excellent, and his whole mind well\r\nbalanced; but I do not suppose that any one would say that he possessed\r\nmuch original genius. He was deeply religious, and so orthodox that he\r\ntold me one day he should be grieved if a single word of the\r\nThirty-nine Articles were altered. His moral qualities were in every\r\nway admirable. He was free from every tinge of vanity or other petty\r\nfeeling; and I never saw a man who thought so little about himself or\r\nhis own concerns. His temper was imperturbably good, with the most\r\nwinning and courteous manners; yet, as I have seen, he could be roused\r\nby any bad action to the warmest indignation and prompt action.\r\n\r\nI once saw in his company in the streets of Cambridge almost as horrid\r\na scene as could have been witnessed during the French Revolution. Two\r\nbody-snatchers had been arrested, and whilst being taken to prison had\r\nbeen torn from the constable by a crowd of the roughest men, who\r\ndragged them by their legs along the muddy and stony road. They were\r\ncovered from head to foot with mud, and their faces were bleeding\r\neither from having been kicked or from the stones; they looked like\r\ncorpses, but the crowd was so dense that I got only a few momentary\r\nglimpses of the wretched creatures. Never in my life have I seen such\r\nwrath painted on a man’s face as was shown by Henslow at this horrid\r\nscene. He tried repeatedly to penetrate the mob; but it was simply\r\nimpossible. He then rushed away to the mayor, telling me not to follow\r\nhim, but to get more policemen. I forget the issue, except that the two\r\nmen were got into the prison without being killed.\r\n\r\nHenslow’s benevolence was unbounded, as he proved by his many excellent\r\nschemes for his poor parishioners, when in after years he held the\r\nliving of Hitcham. My intimacy with such a man ought to have been, and\r\nI hope was, an inestimable benefit. I cannot resist mentioning a\r\ntrifling incident, which showed his kind consideration. Whilst\r\nexamining some pollen-grains on a damp surface, I saw the tubes\r\nexserted, and instantly rushed off to communicate my surprising\r\ndiscovery to him. Now I do not suppose any other professor of botany\r\ncould have helped laughing at my coming in such a hurry to make such a\r\ncommunication. But he agreed how interesting the phenomenon was, and\r\nexplained its meaning, but made me clearly understand how well it was\r\nknown; so I left him not in the least mortified, but well pleased at\r\nhaving discovered for myself so remarkable a fact, but determined not\r\nto be in such a hurry again to communicate my discoveries.\r\n\r\nDr. Whewell was one of the older and distinguished men who sometimes\r\nvisited Henslow, and on several occasions I walked home with him at\r\nnight. Next to Sir J. Mackintosh he was the best converser on grave\r\nsubjects to whom I ever listened. Leonard Jenyns (The well-known Soame\r\nJenyns was cousin to Mr. Jenyns’ father.), who afterwards published\r\nsome good essays in Natural History (Mr. Jenyns (now Blomefield)\r\ndescribed the fish for the Zoology of the “Beagle”; and is author of a\r\nlong series of papers, chiefly Zoological.), often stayed with Henslow,\r\nwho was his brother-in-law. I visited him at his parsonage on the\r\nborders of the Fens [Swaffham Bulbeck], and had many a good walk and\r\ntalk with him about Natural History. I became also acquainted with\r\nseveral other men older than me, who did not care much about science,\r\nbut were friends of Henslow. One was a Scotchman, brother of Sir\r\nAlexander Ramsay, and tutor of Jesus College: he was a delightful man,\r\nbut did not live for many years. Another was Mr. Dawes, afterwards Dean\r\nof Hereford, and famous for his success in the education of the poor.\r\nThese men and others of the same standing, together with Henslow, used\r\nsometimes to take distant excursions into the country, which I was\r\nallowed to join, and they were most agreeable.\r\n\r\nLooking back, I infer that there must have been something in me a\r\nlittle superior to the common run of youths, otherwise the\r\nabove-mentioned men, so much older than me and higher in academical\r\nposition, would never have allowed me to associate with them. Certainly\r\nI was not aware of any such superiority, and I remember one of my\r\nsporting friends, Turner, who saw me at work with my beetles, saying\r\nthat I should some day be a Fellow of the Royal Society, and the notion\r\nseemed to me preposterous.\r\n\r\nDuring my last year at Cambridge, I read with care and profound\r\ninterest Humboldt’s ‘Personal Narrative.’ This work, and Sir J.\r\nHerschel’s ‘Introduction to the Study of Natural Philosophy,’ stirred\r\nup in me a burning zeal to add even the most humble contribution to the\r\nnoble structure of Natural Science. No one or a dozen other books\r\ninfluenced me nearly so much as these two. I copied out from Humboldt\r\nlong passages about Teneriffe, and read them aloud on one of the\r\nabove-mentioned excursions, to (I think) Henslow, Ramsay, and Dawes,\r\nfor on a previous occasion I had talked about the glories of Teneriffe,\r\nand some of the party declared they would endeavour to go there; but I\r\nthink that they were only half in earnest. I was, however, quite in\r\nearnest, and got an introduction to a merchant in London to enquire\r\nabout ships; but the scheme was, of course, knocked on the head by the\r\nvoyage of the “Beagle”.\r\n\r\nMy summer vacations were given up to collecting beetles, to some\r\nreading, and short tours. In the autumn my whole time was devoted to\r\nshooting, chiefly at Woodhouse and Maer, and sometimes with young Eyton\r\nof Eyton. Upon the whole the three years which I spent at Cambridge\r\nwere the most joyful in my happy life; for I was then in excellent\r\nhealth, and almost always in high spirits.\r\n\r\nAs I had at first come up to Cambridge at Christmas, I was forced to\r\nkeep two terms after passing my final examination, at the commencement\r\nof 1831; and Henslow then persuaded me to begin the study of geology.\r\nTherefore on my return to Shropshire I examined sections, and coloured\r\na map of parts round Shrewsbury. Professor Sedgwick intended to visit\r\nNorth Wales in the beginning of August to pursue his famous geological\r\ninvestigations amongst the older rocks, and Henslow asked him to allow\r\nme to accompany him. (In connection with this tour my father used to\r\ntell a story about Sedgwick: they had started from their inn one\r\nmorning, and had walked a mile or two, when Sedgwick suddenly stopped,\r\nand vowed that he would return, being certain “that damned scoundrel”\r\n(the waiter) had not given the chambermaid the sixpence intrusted to\r\nhim for the purpose. He was ultimately persuaded to give up the\r\nproject, seeing that there was no reason for suspecting the waiter of\r\nespecial perfidy.—F.D.) Accordingly he came and slept at my father’s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nA short conversation with him during this evening produced a strong\r\nimpression on my mind. Whilst examining an old gravel-pit near\r\nShrewsbury, a labourer told me that he had found in it a large worn\r\ntropical Volute shell, such as may be seen on the chimney-pieces of\r\ncottages; and as he would not sell the shell, I was convinced that he\r\nhad really found it in the pit. I told Sedgwick of the fact, and he at\r\nonce said (no doubt truly) that it must have been thrown away by some\r\none into the pit; but then added, if really embedded there it would be\r\nthe greatest misfortune to geology, as it would overthrow all that we\r\nknow about the superficial deposits of the Midland Counties. These\r\ngravel-beds belong in fact to the glacial period, and in after years I\r\nfound in them broken arctic shells. But I was then utterly astonished\r\nat Sedgwick not being delighted at so wonderful a fact as a tropical\r\nshell being found near the surface in the middle of England. Nothing\r\nbefore had ever made me thoroughly realise, though I had read various\r\nscientific books, that science consists in grouping facts so that\r\ngeneral laws or conclusions may be drawn from them.\r\n\r\nNext morning we started for Llangollen, Conway, Bangor, and Capel\r\nCurig. This tour was of decided use in teaching me a little how to make\r\nout the geology of a country. Sedgwick often sent me on a line parallel\r\nto his, telling me to bring back specimens of the rocks and to mark the\r\nstratification on a map. I have little doubt that he did this for my\r\ngood, as I was too ignorant to have aided him. On this tour I had a\r\nstriking instance of how easy it is to overlook phenomena, however\r\nconspicuous, before they have been observed by any one. We spent many\r\nhours in Cwm Idwal, examining all the rocks with extreme care, as\r\nSedgwick was anxious to find fossils in them; but neither of us saw a\r\ntrace of the wonderful glacial phenomena all around us; we did not\r\nnotice the plainly scored rocks, the perched boulders, the lateral and\r\nterminal moraines. Yet these phenomena are so conspicuous that, as I\r\ndeclared in a paper published many years afterwards in the\r\n‘Philosophical Magazine’ (‘Philosophical Magazine,’ 1842.), a house\r\nburnt down by fire did not tell its story more plainly than did this\r\nvalley. If it had still been filled by a glacier, the phenomena would\r\nhave been less distinct than they now are.\r\n\r\nAt Capel Curig I left Sedgwick and went in a straight line by compass\r\nand map across the mountains to Barmouth, never following any track\r\nunless it coincided with my course. I thus came on some strange wild\r\nplaces, and enjoyed much this manner of travelling. I visited Barmouth\r\nto see some Cambridge friends who were reading there, and thence\r\nreturned to Shrewsbury and to Maer for shooting; for at that time I\r\nshould have thought myself mad to give up the first days of\r\npartridge-shooting for geology or any other science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“VOYAGE OF THE ‘BEAGLE’ FROM DECEMBER 27, 1831, TO OCTOBER 2, 1836.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn returning home from my short geological tour in North Wales, I found\r\na letter from Henslow, informing me that Captain Fitz-Roy was willing\r\nto give up part of his own cabin to any young man who would volunteer\r\nto go with him without pay as naturalist to the Voyage of the “Beagle”.\r\nI have given, as I believe, in my MS. Journal an account of all the\r\ncircumstances which then occurred; I will here only say that I was\r\ninstantly eager to accept the offer, but my father strongly objected,\r\nadding the words, fortunate for me, “If you can find any man of common\r\nsense who advises you to go I will give my consent.” So I wrote that\r\nevening and refused the offer. On the next morning I went to Maer to be\r\nready for September 1st, and, whilst out shooting, my uncle (Josiah\r\nWedgwood.) sent for me, offering to drive me over to Shrewsbury and\r\ntalk with my father, as my uncle thought it would be wise in me to\r\naccept the offer. My father always maintained that he was one of the\r\nmost sensible men in the world, and he at once consented in the kindest\r\nmanner. I had been rather extravagant at Cambridge, and to console my\r\nfather, said, “that I should be deuced clever to spend more than my\r\nallowance whilst on board the ‘Beagle’;” but he answered with a smile,\r\n“But they tell me you are very clever.”\r\n\r\nNext day I started for Cambridge to see Henslow, and thence to London\r\nto see Fitz-Roy, and all was soon arranged. Afterwards, on becoming\r\nvery intimate with Fitz-Roy, I heard that I had run a very narrow risk\r\nof being rejected, on account of the shape of my nose! He was an ardent\r\ndisciple of Lavater, and was convinced that he could judge of a man’s\r\ncharacter by the outline of his features; and he doubted whether any\r\none with my nose could possess sufficient energy and determination for\r\nthe voyage. But I think he was afterwards well satisfied that my nose\r\nhad spoken falsely.\r\n\r\nFitz-Roy’s character was a singular one, with very many noble features:\r\nhe was devoted to his duty, generous to a fault, bold, determined, and\r\nindomitably energetic, and an ardent friend to all under his sway. He\r\nwould undertake any sort of trouble to assist those whom he thought\r\ndeserved assistance. He was a handsome man, strikingly like a\r\ngentleman, with highly courteous manners, which resembled those of his\r\nmaternal uncle, the famous Lord Castlereagh, as I was told by the\r\nMinister at Rio. Nevertheless he must have inherited much in his\r\nappearance from Charles II., for Dr. Wallich gave me a collection of\r\nphotographs which he had made, and I was struck with the resemblance of\r\none to Fitz-Roy; and on looking at the name, I found it Ch. E. Sobieski\r\nStuart, Count d’Albanie, a descendant of the same monarch.\r\n\r\nFitz-Roy’s temper was a most unfortunate one. It was usually worst in\r\nthe early morning, and with his eagle eye he could generally detect\r\nsomething amiss about the ship, and was then unsparing in his blame. He\r\nwas very kind to me, but was a man very difficult to live with on the\r\nintimate terms which necessarily followed from our messing by ourselves\r\nin the same cabin. We had several quarrels; for instance, early in the\r\nvoyage at Bahia, in Brazil, he defended and praised slavery, which I\r\nabominated, and told me that he had just visited a great slave-owner,\r\nwho had called up many of his slaves and asked them whether they were\r\nhappy, and whether they wished to be free, and all answered “No.” I\r\nthen asked him, perhaps with a sneer, whether he thought that the\r\nanswer of slaves in the presence of their master was worth anything?\r\nThis made him excessively angry, and he said that as I doubted his word\r\nwe could not live any longer together. I thought that I should have\r\nbeen compelled to leave the ship; but as soon as the news spread, which\r\nit did quickly, as the captain sent for the first lieutenant to assuage\r\nhis anger by abusing me, I was deeply gratified by receiving an\r\ninvitation from all the gun-room officers to mess with them. But after\r\na few hours Fitz-Roy showed his usual magnanimity by sending an officer\r\nto me with an apology and a request that I would continue to live with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHis character was in several respects one of the most noble which I\r\nhave ever known.\r\n\r\nThe voyage of the “Beagle” has been by far the most important event in\r\nmy life, and has determined my whole career; yet it depended on so\r\nsmall a circumstance as my uncle offering to drive me thirty miles to\r\nShrewsbury, which few uncles would have done, and on such a trifle as\r\nthe shape of my nose. I have always felt that I owe to the voyage the\r\nfirst real training or education of my mind; I was led to attend\r\nclosely to several branches of natural history, and thus my powers of\r\nobservation were improved, though they were always fairly developed.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of the geology of all the places visited was far more\r\nimportant, as reasoning here comes into play. On first examining a new\r\ndistrict nothing can appear more hopeless than the chaos of rocks; but\r\nby recording the stratification and nature of the rocks and fossils at\r\nmany points, always reasoning and predicting what will be found\r\nelsewhere, light soon begins to dawn on the district, and the structure\r\nof the whole becomes more or less intelligible. I had brought with me\r\nthe first volume of Lyell’s ‘Principles of Geology,’ which I studied\r\nattentively; and the book was of the highest service to me in many\r\nways. The very first place which I examined, namely St. Jago in the\r\nCape de Verde islands, showed me clearly the wonderful superiority of\r\nLyell’s manner of treating geology, compared with that of any other\r\nauthor, whose works I had with me or ever afterwards read.\r\n\r\nAnother of my occupations was collecting animals of all classes,\r\nbriefly describing and roughly dissecting many of the marine ones; but\r\nfrom not being able to draw, and from not having sufficient anatomical\r\nknowledge, a great pile of MS. which I made during the voyage has\r\nproved almost useless. I thus lost much time, with the exception of\r\nthat spent in acquiring some knowledge of the Crustaceans, as this was\r\nof service when in after years I undertook a monograph of the\r\nCirripedia.\r\n\r\nDuring some part of the day I wrote my Journal, and took much pains in\r\ndescribing carefully and vividly all that I had seen; and this was good\r\npractice. My Journal served also, in part, as letters to my home, and\r\nportions were sent to England whenever there was an opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe above various special studies were, however, of no importance\r\ncompared with the habit of energetic industry and of concentrated\r\nattention to whatever I was engaged in, which I then acquired.\r\nEverything about which I thought or read was made to bear directly on\r\nwhat I had seen or was likely to see; and this habit of mind was\r\ncontinued during the five years of the voyage. I feel sure that it was\r\nthis training which has enabled me to do whatever I have done in\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nLooking backwards, I can now perceive how my love for science gradually\r\npreponderated over every other taste. During the first two years my old\r\npassion for shooting survived in nearly full force, and I shot myself\r\nall the birds and animals for my collection; but gradually I gave up my\r\ngun more and more, and finally altogether, to my servant, as shooting\r\ninterfered with my work, more especially with making out the geological\r\nstructure of a country. I discovered, though unconsciously and\r\ninsensibly, that the pleasure of observing and reasoning was a much\r\nhigher one than that of skill and sport. That my mind became developed\r\nthrough my pursuits during the voyage is rendered probable by a remark\r\nmade by my father, who was the most acute observer whom I ever saw, of\r\na sceptical disposition, and far from being a believer in phrenology;\r\nfor on first seeing me after the voyage, he turned round to my sisters,\r\nand exclaimed, “Why, the shape of his head is quite altered.”\r\n\r\nTo return to the voyage. On September 11th (1831), I paid a flying\r\nvisit with Fitz-Roy to the “Beagle” at Plymouth. Thence to Shrewsbury\r\nto wish my father and sisters a long farewell. On October 24th I took\r\nup my residence at Plymouth, and remained there until December 27th,\r\nwhen the “Beagle” finally left the shores of England for her\r\ncircumnavigation of the world. We made two earlier attempts to sail,\r\nbut were driven back each time by heavy gales. These two months at\r\nPlymouth were the most miserable which I ever spent, though I exerted\r\nmyself in various ways. I was out of spirits at the thought of leaving\r\nall my family and friends for so long a time, and the weather seemed to\r\nme inexpressibly gloomy. I was also troubled with palpitation and pain\r\nabout the heart, and like many a young ignorant man, especially one\r\nwith a smattering of medical knowledge, was convinced that I had heart\r\ndisease. I did not consult any doctor, as I fully expected to hear the\r\nverdict that I was not fit for the voyage, and I was resolved to go at\r\nall hazards.\r\n\r\nI need not here refer to the events of the voyage—where we went and\r\nwhat we did—as I have given a sufficiently full account in my published\r\nJournal. The glories of the vegetation of the Tropics rise before my\r\nmind at the present time more vividly than anything else; though the\r\nsense of sublimity, which the great deserts of Patagonia and the\r\nforest-clad mountains of Tierra del Fuego excited in me, has left an\r\nindelible impression on my mind. The sight of a naked savage in his\r\nnative land is an event which can never be forgotten. Many of my\r\nexcursions on horseback through wild countries, or in the boats, some\r\nof which lasted several weeks, were deeply interesting: their\r\ndiscomfort and some degree of danger were at that time hardly a\r\ndrawback, and none at all afterwards. I also reflect with high\r\nsatisfaction on some of my scientific work, such as solving the problem\r\nof coral islands, and making out the geological structure of certain\r\nislands, for instance, St. Helena. Nor must I pass over the discovery\r\nof the singular relations of the animals and plants inhabiting the\r\nseveral islands of the Galapagos archipelago, and of all of them to the\r\ninhabitants of South America.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can judge of myself, I worked to the utmost during the\r\nvoyage from the mere pleasure of investigation, and from my strong\r\ndesire to add a few facts to the great mass of facts in Natural\r\nScience. But I was also ambitious to take a fair place among scientific\r\nmen,—whether more ambitious or less so than most of my fellow-workers,\r\nI can form no opinion.\r\n\r\nThe geology of St. Jago is very striking, yet simple: a stream of lava\r\nformerly flowed over the bed of the sea, formed of triturated recent\r\nshells and corals, which it has baked into a hard white rock. Since\r\nthen the whole island has been upheaved. But the line of white rock\r\nrevealed to me a new and important fact, namely, that there had been\r\nafterwards subsidence round the craters, which had since been in\r\naction, and had poured forth lava. It then first dawned on me that I\r\nmight perhaps write a book on the geology of the various countries\r\nvisited, and this made me thrill with delight. That was a memorable\r\nhour to me, and how distinctly I can call to mind the low cliff of lava\r\nbeneath which I rested, with the sun glaring hot, a few strange desert\r\nplants growing near, and with living corals in the tidal pools at my\r\nfeet. Later in the voyage, Fitz-Roy asked me to read some of my\r\nJournal, and declared it would be worth publishing; so here was a\r\nsecond book in prospect!\r\n\r\nTowards the close of our voyage I received a letter whilst at\r\nAscension, in which my sisters told me that Sedgwick had called on my\r\nfather, and said that I should take a place among the leading\r\nscientific men. I could not at the time understand how he could have\r\nlearnt anything of my proceedings, but I heard (I believe afterwards)\r\nthat Henslow had read some of the letters which I wrote to him before\r\nthe Philosophical Society of Cambridge (Read at the meeting held\r\nNovember 16, 1835, and printed in a pamphlet of 31 pages for\r\ndistribution among the members of the Society.), and had printed them\r\nfor private distribution. My collection of fossil bones, which had been\r\nsent to Henslow, also excited considerable attention amongst\r\npalaeontologists. After reading this letter, I clambered over the\r\nmountains of Ascension with a bounding step, and made the volcanic\r\nrocks resound under my geological hammer. All this shows how ambitious\r\nI was; but I think that I can say with truth that in after years,\r\nthough I cared in the highest degree for the approbation of such men as\r\nLyell and Hooker, who were my friends, I did not care much about the\r\ngeneral public. I do not mean to say that a favourable review or a\r\nlarge sale of my books did not please me greatly, but the pleasure was\r\na fleeting one, and I am sure that I have never turned one inch out of\r\nmy course to gain fame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MY RETURN TO ENGLAND (OCTOBER 2, 1836) TO MY MARRIAGE (JANUARY 29,\r\n1839.)\r\n\r\nThese two years and three months were the most active ones which I ever\r\nspent, though I was occasionally unwell, and so lost some time. After\r\ngoing backwards and forwards several times between Shrewsbury, Maer,\r\nCambridge, and London, I settled in lodgings at Cambridge (In\r\nFitzwilliam Street.) on December 13th, where all my collections were\r\nunder the care of Henslow. I stayed here three months, and got my\r\nminerals and rocks examined by the aid of Professor Miller.\r\n\r\nI began preparing my ‘Journal of Travels,’ which was not hard work, as\r\nmy MS. Journal had been written with care, and my chief labour was\r\nmaking an abstract of my more interesting scientific results. I sent\r\nalso, at the request of Lyell, a short account of my observations on\r\nthe elevation of the coast of Chile to the Geological Society.\r\n(‘Geolog. Soc. Proc. ii. 1838, pages 446-449.)\r\n\r\nOn March 7th, 1837, I took lodgings in Great Marlborough Street in\r\nLondon, and remained there for nearly two years, until I was married.\r\nDuring these two years I finished my Journal, read several papers\r\nbefore the Geological Society, began preparing the MS. for my\r\n‘Geological Observations,’ and arranged for the publication of the\r\n‘Zoology of the Voyage of the “Beagle”.’ In July I opened my first\r\nnote-book for facts in relation to the Origin of Species, about which I\r\nhad long reflected, and never ceased working for the next twenty years.\r\n\r\nDuring these two years I also went a little into society, and acted as\r\none of the honorary secretaries of the Geological Society. I saw a\r\ngreat deal of Lyell. One of his chief characteristics was his sympathy\r\nwith the work of others, and I was as much astonished as delighted at\r\nthe interest which he showed when, on my return to England, I explained\r\nto him my views on coral reefs. This encouraged me greatly, and his\r\nadvice and example had much influence on me. During this time I saw\r\nalso a good deal of Robert Brown; I used often to call and sit with him\r\nduring his breakfast on Sunday mornings, and he poured forth a rich\r\ntreasure of curious observations and acute remarks, but they almost\r\nalways related to minute points, and he never with me discussed large\r\nor general questions in science.\r\n\r\nDuring these two years I took several short excursions as a relaxation,\r\nand one longer one to the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy, an account of\r\nwhich was published in the ‘Philosophical Transactions.’ (1839, pages\r\n39-82.) This paper was a great failure, and I am ashamed of it. Having\r\nbeen deeply impressed with what I had seen of the elevation of the land\r\nof South America, I attributed the parallel lines to the action of the\r\nsea; but I had to give up this view when Agassiz propounded his\r\nglacier-lake theory. Because no other explanation was possible under\r\nour then state of knowledge, I argued in favour of sea-action; and my\r\nerror has been a good lesson to me never to trust in science to the\r\nprinciple of exclusion.\r\n\r\nAs I was not able to work all day at science, I read a good deal during\r\nthese two years on various subjects, including some metaphysical books;\r\nbut I was not well fitted for such studies. About this time I took much\r\ndelight in Wordsworth’s and Coleridge’s poetry; and can boast that I\r\nread the ‘Excursion’ twice through. Formerly Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost’\r\nhad been my chief favourite, and in my excursions during the voyage of\r\nthe “Beagle”, when I could take only a single volume, I always chose\r\nMilton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MY MARRIAGE, JANUARY 29, 1839, AND RESIDENCE IN UPPER GOWER\r\nSTREET, TO OUR LEAVING LONDON AND SETTLING AT DOWN, SEPTEMBER 14,\r\n1842.\r\n\r\n\r\n(After speaking of his happy married life, and of his children, he\r\ncontinues:—)\r\n\r\nDuring the three years and eight months whilst we resided in London, I\r\ndid less scientific work, though I worked as hard as I possibly could,\r\nthan during any other equal length of time in my life. This was owing\r\nto frequently recurring unwellness, and to one long and serious\r\nillness. The greater part of my time, when I could do anything, was\r\ndevoted to my work on ‘Coral Reefs,’ which I had begun before my\r\nmarriage, and of which the last proof-sheet was corrected on May 6th,\r\n1842. This book, though a small one, cost me twenty months of hard\r\nwork, as I had to read every work on the islands of the Pacific and to\r\nconsult many charts. It was thought highly of by scientific men, and\r\nthe theory therein given is, I think, now well established.\r\n\r\nNo other work of mine was begun in so deductive a spirit as this, for\r\nthe whole theory was thought out on the west coast of South America,\r\nbefore I had seen a true coral reef. I had therefore only to verify and\r\nextend my views by a careful examination of living reefs. But it should\r\nbe observed that I had during the two previous years been incessantly\r\nattending to the effects on the shores of South America of the\r\nintermittent elevation of the land, together with denudation and the\r\ndeposition of sediment. This necessarily led me to reflect much on the\r\neffects of subsidence, and it was easy to replace in imagination the\r\ncontinued deposition of sediment by the upward growth of corals. To do\r\nthis was to form my theory of the formation of barrier-reefs and\r\natolls.\r\n\r\nBesides my work on coral-reefs, during my residence in London, I read\r\nbefore the Geological Society papers on the Erratic Boulders of South\r\nAmerica (‘Geolog. Soc. Proc.’ iii. 1842.), on Earthquakes (‘Geolog.\r\nTrans. v. 1840.), and on the Formation by the Agency of Earth-worms of\r\nMould. (‘Geolog. Soc. Proc. ii. 1838.) I also continued to superintend\r\nthe publication of the ‘Zoology of the Voyage of the “Beagle”.’ Nor did\r\nI ever intermit collecting facts bearing on the origin of species; and\r\nI could sometimes do this when I could do nothing else from illness.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1842 I was stronger than I had been for some time, and\r\ntook a little tour by myself in North Wales, for the sake of observing\r\nthe effects of the old glaciers which formerly filled all the larger\r\nvalleys. I published a short account of what I saw in the\r\n‘Philosophical Magazine.’ (‘Philosophical Magazine,’ 1842.) This\r\nexcursion interested me greatly, and it was the last time I was ever\r\nstrong enough to climb mountains or to take long walks such as are\r\nnecessary for geological work.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of our life in London, I was strong enough to go\r\ninto general society, and saw a good deal of several scientific men,\r\nand other more or less distinguished men. I will give my impressions\r\nwith respect to some of them, though I have little to say worth saying.\r\n\r\nI saw more of Lyell than of any other man, both before and after my\r\nmarriage. His mind was characterised, as it appeared to me, by\r\nclearness, caution, sound judgment, and a good deal of originality.\r\nWhen I made any remark to him on Geology, he never rested until he saw\r\nthe whole case clearly, and often made me see it more clearly than I\r\nhad done before. He would advance all possible objections to my\r\nsuggestion, and even after these were exhausted would long remain\r\ndubious. A second characteristic was his hearty sympathy with the work\r\nof other scientific men. (The slight repetition here observable is\r\naccounted for by the notes on Lyell, etc., having been added in April,\r\n1881, a few years after the rest of the ‘Recollections’ were written.)\r\n\r\nOn my return from the voyage of the “Beagle”, I explained to him my\r\nviews on coral-reefs, which differed from his, and I was greatly\r\nsurprised and encouraged by the vivid interest which he showed. His\r\ndelight in science was ardent, and he felt the keenest interest in the\r\nfuture progress of mankind. He was very kind-hearted, and thoroughly\r\nliberal in his religious beliefs, or rather disbeliefs; but he was a\r\nstrong theist. His candour was highly remarkable. He exhibited this by\r\nbecoming a convert to the Descent theory, though he had gained much\r\nfame by opposing Lamarck’s views, and this after he had grown old. He\r\nreminded me that I had many years before said to him, when discussing\r\nthe opposition of the old school of geologists to his new views, “What\r\na good thing it would be if every scientific man was to die when sixty\r\nyears old, as afterwards he would be sure to oppose all new doctrines.”\r\nBut he hoped that now he might be allowed to live.\r\n\r\nThe science of Geology is enormously indebted to Lyell—more so, as I\r\nbelieve, than to any other man who ever lived. When [I was] starting on\r\nthe voyage of the “Beagle”, the sagacious Henslow, who, like all other\r\ngeologists, believed at that time in successive cataclysms, advised me\r\nto get and study the first volume of the ‘Principles,’ which had then\r\njust been published, but on no account to accept the views therein\r\nadvocated. How differently would anyone now speak of the ‘Principles’!\r\nI am proud to remember that the first place, namely, St. Jago, in the\r\nCape de Verde archipelago, in which I geologised, convinced me of the\r\ninfinite superiority of Lyell’s views over those advocated in any other\r\nwork known to me.\r\n\r\nThe powerful effects of Lyell’s works could formerly be plainly seen in\r\nthe different progress of the science in France and England. The\r\npresent total oblivion of Elie de Beaumont’s wild hypotheses, such as\r\nhis ‘Craters of Elevation’ and ‘Lines of Elevation’ (which latter\r\nhypothesis I heard Sedgwick at the Geological Society lauding to the\r\nskies), may be largely attributed to Lyell.\r\n\r\nI saw a good deal of Robert Brown, “facile Princeps Botanicorum,” as he\r\nwas called by Humboldt. He seemed to me to be chiefly remarkable for\r\nthe minuteness of his observations, and their perfect accuracy. His\r\nknowledge was extraordinarily great, and much died with him, owing to\r\nhis excessive fear of ever making a mistake. He poured out his\r\nknowledge to me in the most unreserved manner, yet was strangely\r\njealous on some points. I called on him two or three times before the\r\nvoyage of the “Beagle”, and on one occasion he asked me to look through\r\na microscope and describe what I saw. This I did, and believe now that\r\nit was the marvellous currents of protoplasm in some vegetable cell. I\r\nthen asked him what I had seen; but he answered me, “That is my little\r\nsecret.”\r\n\r\nHe was capable of the most generous actions. When old, much out of\r\nhealth, and quite unfit for any exertion, he daily visited (as Hooker\r\ntold me) an old man-servant, who lived at a distance (and whom he\r\nsupported), and read aloud to him. This is enough to make up for any\r\ndegree of scientific penuriousness or jealousy.\r\n\r\nI may here mention a few other eminent men, whom I have occasionally\r\nseen, but I have little to say about them worth saying. I felt a high\r\nreverence for Sir J. Herschel, and was delighted to dine with him at\r\nhis charming house at the Cape of Good Hope, and afterwards at his\r\nLondon house. I saw him, also, on a few other occasions. He never\r\ntalked much, but every word which he uttered was worth listening to.\r\n\r\nI once met at breakfast at Sir R. Murchison’s house the illustrious\r\nHumboldt, who honoured me by expressing a wish to see me. I was a\r\nlittle disappointed with the great man, but my anticipations probably\r\nwere too high. I can remember nothing distinctly about our interview,\r\nexcept that Humboldt was very cheerful and talked much.\r\n\r\n—reminds me of Buckle whom I once met at Hensleigh Wedgwood’s. I was\r\nvery glad to learn from him his system of collecting facts. He told me\r\nthat he bought all the books which he read, and made a full index, to\r\neach, of the facts which he thought might prove serviceable to him, and\r\nthat he could always remember in what book he had read anything, for\r\nhis memory was wonderful. I asked him how at first he could judge what\r\nfacts would be serviceable, and he answered that he did not know, but\r\nthat a sort of instinct guided him. From this habit of making indices,\r\nhe was enabled to give the astonishing number of references on all\r\nsorts of subjects, which may be found in his ‘History of Civilisation.’\r\nThis book I thought most interesting, and read it twice, but I doubt\r\nwhether his generalisations are worth anything. Buckle was a great\r\ntalker, and I listened to him saying hardly a word, nor indeed could I\r\nhave done so for he left no gaps. When Mrs. Farrer began to sing, I\r\njumped up and said that I must listen to her; after I had moved away he\r\nturned around to a friend and said (as was overheard by my brother),\r\n“Well, Mr. Darwin’s books are much better than his conversation.”\r\n\r\nOf other great literary men, I once met Sydney Smith at Dean Milman’s\r\nhouse. There was something inexplicably amusing in every word which he\r\nuttered. Perhaps this was partly due to the expectation of being\r\namused. He was talking about Lady Cork, who was then extremely old.\r\nThis was the lady who, as he said, was once so much affected by one of\r\nhis charity sermons, that she _borrowed_ a guinea from a friend to put\r\nin the plate. He now said “It is generally believed that my dear old\r\nfriend Lady Cork has been overlooked,” and he said this in such a\r\nmanner that no one could for a moment doubt that he meant that his dear\r\nold friend had been overlooked by the devil. How he managed to express\r\nthis I know not.\r\n\r\nI likewise once met Macaulay at Lord Stanhope’s (the historian’s)\r\nhouse, and as there was only one other man at dinner, I had a grand\r\nopportunity of hearing him converse, and he was very agreeable. He did\r\nnot talk at all too much; nor indeed could such a man talk too much, as\r\nlong as he allowed others to turn the stream of his conversation, and\r\nthis he did allow.\r\n\r\nLord Stanhope once gave me a curious little proof of the accuracy and\r\nfulness of Macaulay’s memory: many historians used often to meet at\r\nLord Stanhope’s house, and in discussing various subjects they would\r\nsometimes differ from Macaulay, and formerly they often referred to\r\nsome book to see who was right; but latterly, as Lord Stanhope noticed,\r\nno historian ever took this trouble, and whatever Macaulay said was\r\nfinal.\r\n\r\nOn another occasion I met at Lord Stanhope’s house, one of his parties\r\nof historians and other literary men, and amongst them were Motley and\r\nGrote. After luncheon I walked about Chevening Park for nearly an hour\r\nwith Grote, and was much interested by his conversation and pleased by\r\nthe simplicity and absence of all pretension in his manners.\r\n\r\nLong ago I dined occasionally with the old Earl, the father of the\r\nhistorian; he was a strange man, but what little I knew of him I liked\r\nmuch. He was frank, genial, and pleasant. He had strongly marked\r\nfeatures, with a brown complexion, and his clothes, when I saw him,\r\nwere all brown. He seemed to believe in everything which was to others\r\nutterly incredible. He said one day to me, “Why don’t you give up your\r\nfiddle-faddle of geology and zoology, and turn to the occult sciences!”\r\nThe historian, then Lord Mahon, seemed shocked at such a speech to me,\r\nand his charming wife much amused.\r\n\r\nThe last man whom I will mention is Carlyle, seen by me several times\r\nat my brother’s house, and two or three times at my own house. His talk\r\nwas very racy and interesting, just like his writings, but he sometimes\r\nwent on too long on the same subject. I remember a funny dinner at my\r\nbrother’s, where, amongst a few others, were Babbage and Lyell, both of\r\nwhom liked to talk. Carlyle, however, silenced every one by haranguing\r\nduring the whole dinner on the advantages of silence. After dinner\r\nBabbage, in his grimmest manner, thanked Carlyle for his very\r\ninteresting lecture on silence.\r\n\r\nCarlyle sneered at almost every one: one day in my house he called\r\nGrote’s ‘History’ “a fetid quagmire, with nothing spiritual about it.”\r\nI always thought, until his ‘Reminiscences’ appeared, that his sneers\r\nwere partly jokes, but this now seems rather doubtful. His expression\r\nwas that of a depressed, almost despondent yet benevolent man; and it\r\nis notorious how heartily he laughed. I believe that his benevolence\r\nwas real, though stained by not a little jealousy. No one can doubt\r\nabout his extraordinary power of drawing pictures of things and men—far\r\nmore vivid, as it appears to me, than any drawn by Macaulay. Whether\r\nhis pictures of men were true ones is another question.\r\n\r\nHe has been all-powerful in impressing some grand moral truths on the\r\nminds of men. On the other hand, his views about slavery were\r\nrevolting. In his eyes might was right. His mind seemed to me a very\r\nnarrow one; even if all branches of science, which he despised, are\r\nexcluded. It is astonishing to me that Kingsley should have spoken of\r\nhim as a man well fitted to advance science. He laughed to scorn the\r\nidea that a mathematician, such as Whewell, could judge, as I\r\nmaintained he could, of Goethe’s views on light. He thought it a most\r\nridiculous thing that any one should care whether a glacier moved a\r\nlittle quicker or a little slower, or moved at all. As far as I could\r\njudge, I never met a man with a mind so ill adapted for scientific\r\nresearch.\r\n\r\nWhilst living in London, I attended as regularly as I could the\r\nmeetings of several scientific societies, and acted as secretary to the\r\nGeological Society. But such attendance, and ordinary society, suited\r\nmy health so badly that we resolved to live in the country, which we\r\nboth preferred and have never repented of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESIDENCE AT DOWN FROM SEPTEMBER 14, 1842, TO THE PRESENT TIME, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter several fruitless searches in Surrey and elsewhere, we found this\r\nhouse and purchased it. I was pleased with the diversified appearance\r\nof vegetation proper to a chalk district, and so unlike what I had been\r\naccustomed to in the Midland counties; and still more pleased with the\r\nextreme quietness and rusticity of the place. It is not, however, quite\r\nso retired a place as a writer in a German periodical makes it, who\r\nsays that my house can be approached only by a mule-track! Our fixing\r\nourselves here has answered admirably in one way, which we did not\r\nanticipate, namely, by being very convenient for frequent visits from\r\nour children.\r\n\r\nFew persons can have lived a more retired life than we have done.\r\nBesides short visits to the houses of relations, and occasionally to\r\nthe seaside or elsewhere, we have gone nowhere. During the first part\r\nof our residence we went a little into society, and received a few\r\nfriends here; but my health almost always suffered from the excitement,\r\nviolent shivering and vomiting attacks being thus brought on. I have\r\ntherefore been compelled for many years to give up all dinner-parties;\r\nand this has been somewhat of a deprivation to me, as such parties\r\nalways put me into high spirits. From the same cause I have been able\r\nto invite here very few scientific acquaintances.\r\n\r\nMy chief enjoyment and sole employment throughout life has been\r\nscientific work; and the excitement from such work makes me for the\r\ntime forget, or drives quite away, my daily discomfort. I have\r\ntherefore nothing to record during the rest of my life, except the\r\npublication of my several books. Perhaps a few details how they arose\r\nmay be worth giving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY SEVERAL PUBLICATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1844, my observations on the volcanic islands\r\nvisited during the voyage of the “Beagle” were published. In 1845, I\r\ntook much pains in correcting a new edition of my ‘Journal of\r\nResearches,’ which was originally published in 1839 as part of\r\nFitz-Roy’s work. The success of this, my first literary child, always\r\ntickles my vanity more than that of any of my other books. Even to this\r\nday it sells steadily in England and the United States, and has been\r\ntranslated for the second time into German, and into French and other\r\nlanguages. This success of a book of travels, especially of a\r\nscientific one, so many years after its first publication, is\r\nsurprising. Ten thousand copies have been sold in England of the second\r\nedition. In 1846 my ‘Geological Observations on South America’ were\r\npublished. I record in a little diary, which I have always kept, that\r\nmy three geological books (‘Coral Reefs’ included) consumed four and a\r\nhalf years’ steady work; “and now it is ten years since my return to\r\nEngland. How much time have I lost by illness?” I have nothing to say\r\nabout these three books except that to my surprise new editions have\r\nlately been called for. (‘Geological Observations,’ 2nd Edit.1876.\r\n‘Coral Reefs,’ 2nd Edit. 1874.)\r\n\r\nIn October, 1846, I began to work on ‘Cirripedia.’ When on the coast of\r\nChile, I found a most curious form, which burrowed into the shells of\r\nConcholepas, and which differed so much from all other Cirripedes that\r\nI had to form a new sub-order for its sole reception. Lately an allied\r\nburrowing genus has been found on the shores of Portugal. To understand\r\nthe structure of my new Cirripede I had to examine and dissect many of\r\nthe common forms; and this gradually led me on to take up the whole\r\ngroup. I worked steadily on this subject for the next eight years, and\r\nultimately published two thick volumes (Published by the Ray Society.),\r\ndescribing all the known living species, and two thin quartos on the\r\nextinct species. I do not doubt that Sir E. Lytton Bulwer had me in his\r\nmind when he introduced in one of his novels a Professor Long, who had\r\nwritten two huge volumes on limpets.\r\n\r\nAlthough I was employed during eight years on this work, yet I record\r\nin my diary that about two years out of this time was lost by illness.\r\nOn this account I went in 1848 for some months to Malvern for\r\nhydropathic treatment, which did me much good, so that on my return\r\nhome I was able to resume work. So much was I out of health that when\r\nmy dear father died on November 13th, 1848, I was unable to attend his\r\nfuneral or to act as one of his executors.\r\n\r\nMy work on the Cirripedia possesses, I think, considerable value, as\r\nbesides describing several new and remarkable forms, I made out the\r\nhomologies of the various parts—I discovered the cementing apparatus,\r\nthough I blundered dreadfully about the cement glands—and lastly I\r\nproved the existence in certain genera of minute males complemental to\r\nand parasitic on the hermaphrodites. This latter discovery has at last\r\nbeen fully confirmed; though at one time a German writer was pleased to\r\nattribute the whole account to my fertile imagination. The Cirripedes\r\nform a highly varying and difficult group of species to class; and my\r\nwork was of considerable use to me, when I had to discuss in the\r\n‘Origin of Species’ the principles of a natural classification.\r\nNevertheless, I doubt whether the work was worth the consumption of so\r\nmuch time.\r\n\r\nFrom September 1854 I devoted my whole time to arranging my huge pile\r\nof notes, to observing, and to experimenting in relation to the\r\ntransmutation of species. During the voyage of the “Beagle” I had been\r\ndeeply impressed by discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil\r\nanimals covered with armour like that on the existing armadillos;\r\nsecondly, by the manner in which closely allied animals replace one\r\nanother in proceeding southwards over the Continent; and thirdly, by\r\nthe South American character of most of the productions of the\r\nGalapagos archipelago, and more especially by the manner in which they\r\ndiffer slightly on each island of the group; none of the islands\r\nappearing to be very ancient in a geological sense.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that such facts as these, as well as many others, could\r\nonly be explained on the supposition that species gradually become\r\nmodified; and the subject haunted me. But it was equally evident that\r\nneither the action of the surrounding conditions, nor the will of the\r\norganisms (especially in the case of plants) could account for the\r\ninnumerable cases in which organisms of every kind are beautifully\r\nadapted to their habits of life—for instance, a woodpecker or a\r\ntree-frog to climb trees, or a seed for dispersal by hooks or plumes. I\r\nhad always been much struck by such adaptations, and until these could\r\nbe explained it seemed to me almost useless to endeavour to prove by\r\nindirect evidence that species have been modified.\r\n\r\nAfter my return to England it appeared to me that by following the\r\nexample of Lyell in Geology, and by collecting all facts which bore in\r\nany way on the variation of animals and plants under domestication and\r\nnature, some light might perhaps be thrown on the whole subject. My\r\nfirst note-book was opened in July 1837. I worked on true Baconian\r\nprinciples, and without any theory collected facts on a wholesale\r\nscale, more especially with respect to domesticated productions, by\r\nprinted enquiries, by conversation with skilful breeders and gardeners,\r\nand by extensive reading. When I see the list of books of all kinds\r\nwhich I read and abstracted, including whole series of Journals and\r\nTransactions, I am surprised at my industry. I soon perceived that\r\nselection was the keystone of man’s success in making useful races of\r\nanimals and plants. But how selection could be applied to organisms\r\nliving in a state of nature remained for some time a mystery to me.\r\n\r\nIn October 1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my\r\nsystematic enquiry, I happened to read for amusement ‘Malthus on\r\nPopulation,’ and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for\r\nexistence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of\r\nthe habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these\r\ncircumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and\r\nunfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the\r\nformation of new species. Here then I had at last got a theory by which\r\nto work; but I was so anxious to avoid prejudice, that I determined not\r\nfor some time to write even the briefest sketch of it. In June 1842 I\r\nfirst allowed myself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract\r\nof my theory in pencil in 35 pages; and this was enlarged during the\r\nsummer of 1844 into one of 230 pages, which I had fairly copied out and\r\nstill possess.\r\n\r\nBut at that time I overlooked one problem of great importance; and it\r\nis astonishing to me, except on the principle of Columbus and his egg,\r\nhow I could have overlooked it and its solution. This problem is the\r\ntendency in organic beings descended from the same stock to diverge in\r\ncharacter as they become modified. That they have diverged greatly is\r\nobvious from the manner in which species of all kinds can be classed\r\nunder genera, genera under families, families under sub-orders and so\r\nforth; and I can remember the very spot in the road, whilst in my\r\ncarriage, when to my joy the solution occurred to me; and this was long\r\nafter I had come to Down. The solution, as I believe, is that the\r\nmodified offspring of all dominant and increasing forms tend to become\r\nadapted to many and highly diversified places in the economy of nature.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1856 Lyell advised me to write out my views pretty fully, and\r\nI began at once to do so on a scale three or four times as extensive as\r\nthat which was afterwards followed in my ‘Origin of Species;’ yet it\r\nwas only an abstract of the materials which I had collected, and I got\r\nthrough about half the work on this scale. But my plans were\r\noverthrown, for early in the summer of 1858 Mr. Wallace, who was then\r\nin the Malay archipelago, sent me an essay “On the Tendency of\r\nVarieties to depart indefinitely from the Original Type;” and this\r\nessay contained exactly the same theory as mine. Mr. Wallace expressed\r\nthe wish that if I thought well of his essay, I should sent it to Lyell\r\nfor perusal.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances under which I consented at the request of Lyell and\r\nHooker to allow of an abstract from my MS., together with a letter to\r\nAsa Gray, dated September 5, 1857, to be published at the same time\r\nwith Wallace’s Essay, are given in the ‘Journal of the Proceedings of\r\nthe Linnean Society,’ 1858, page 45. I was at first very unwilling to\r\nconsent, as I thought Mr. Wallace might consider my doing so\r\nunjustifiable, for I did not then know how generous and noble was his\r\ndisposition. The extract from my MS. and the letter to Asa Gray had\r\nneither been intended for publication, and were badly written. Mr.\r\nWallace’s essay, on the other hand, was admirably expressed and quite\r\nclear. Nevertheless, our joint productions excited very little\r\nattention, and the only published notice of them which I can remember\r\nwas by Professor Haughton of Dublin, whose verdict was that all that\r\nwas new in them was false, and what was true was old. This shows how\r\nnecessary it is that any new view should be explained at considerable\r\nlength in order to arouse public attention.\r\n\r\nIn September 1858 I set to work by the strong advice of Lyell and\r\nHooker to prepare a volume on the transmutation of species, but was\r\noften interrupted by ill-health, and short visits to Dr. Lane’s\r\ndelightful hydropathic establishment at Moor Park. I abstracted the MS.\r\nbegun on a much larger scale in 1856, and completed the volume on the\r\nsame reduced scale. It cost me thirteen months and ten days’ hard\r\nlabour. It was published under the title of the ‘Origin of Species,’ in\r\nNovember 1859. Though considerably added to and corrected in the later\r\neditions, it has remained substantially the same book.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt the chief work of my life. It was from the first highly\r\nsuccessful. The first small edition of 1250 copies was sold on the day\r\nof publication, and a second edition of 3000 copies soon afterwards.\r\nSixteen thousand copies have now (1876) been sold in England; and\r\nconsidering how stiff a book it is, this is a large sale. It has been\r\ntranslated into almost every European tongue, even into such languages\r\nas Spanish, Bohemian, Polish, and Russian. It has also, according to\r\nMiss Bird, been translated into Japanese (Miss Bird is mistaken, as I\r\nlearn from Prof. Mitsukuri.—F.D.), and is there much studied. Even an\r\nessay in Hebrew has appeared on it, showing that the theory is\r\ncontained in the Old Testament! The reviews were very numerous; for\r\nsome time I collected all that appeared on the ‘Origin’ and on my\r\nrelated books, and these amount (excluding newspaper reviews) to 265;\r\nbut after a time I gave up the attempt in despair. Many separate essays\r\nand books on the subject have appeared; and in Germany a catalogue or\r\nbibliography on “Darwinismus” has appeared every year or two.\r\n\r\nThe success of the ‘Origin’ may, I think, be attributed in large part\r\nto my having long before written two condensed sketches, and to my\r\nhaving finally abstracted a much larger manuscript, which was itself an\r\nabstract. By this means I was enabled to select the more striking facts\r\nand conclusions. I had, also, during many years followed a golden rule,\r\nnamely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought\r\ncame across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a\r\nmemorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by\r\nexperience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape\r\nfrom the memory than favourable ones. Owing to this habit, very few\r\nobjections were raised against my views which I had not at least\r\nnoticed and attempted to answer.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been said that the success of the ‘Origin’ proved\r\n“that the subject was in the air,” or “that men’s minds were prepared\r\nfor it.” I do not think that this is strictly true, for I occasionally\r\nsounded not a few naturalists, and never happened to come across a\r\nsingle one who seemed to doubt about the permanence of species. Even\r\nLyell and Hooker, though they would listen with interest to me, never\r\nseemed to agree. I tried once or twice to explain to able men what I\r\nmeant by Natural Selection, but signally failed. What I believe was\r\nstrictly true is that innumerable well-observed facts were stored in\r\nthe minds of naturalists ready to take their proper places as soon as\r\nany theory which would receive them was sufficiently explained. Another\r\nelement in the success of the book was its moderate size; and this I\r\nowe to the appearance of Mr. Wallace’s essay; had I published on the\r\nscale in which I began to write in 1856, the book would have been four\r\nor five times as large as the ‘Origin,’ and very few would have had the\r\npatience to read it.\r\n\r\nI gained much by my delay in publishing from about 1839, when the\r\ntheory was clearly conceived, to 1859; and I lost nothing by it, for I\r\ncared very little whether men attributed most originality to me or\r\nWallace; and his essay no doubt aided in the reception of the theory. I\r\nwas forestalled in only one important point, which my vanity has always\r\nmade me regret, namely, the explanation by means of the Glacial period\r\nof the presence of the same species of plants and of some few animals\r\non distant mountain summits and in the arctic regions. This view\r\npleased me so much that I wrote it out in extenso, and I believe that\r\nit was read by Hooker some years before E. Forbes published his\r\ncelebrated memoir (‘Geolog. Survey Mem.,’ 1846.) on the subject. In the\r\nvery few points in which we differed, I still think that I was in the\r\nright. I have never, of course, alluded in print to my having\r\nindependently worked out this view.\r\n\r\nHardly any point gave me so much satisfaction when I was at work on the\r\n‘Origin,’ as the explanation of the wide difference in many classes\r\nbetween the embryo and the adult animal, and of the close resemblance\r\nof the embryos within the same class. No notice of this point was\r\ntaken, as far as I remember, in the early reviews of the ‘Origin,’ and\r\nI recollect expressing my surprise on this head in a letter to Asa\r\nGray. Within late years several reviewers have given the whole credit\r\nto Fritz Muller and Hackel, who undoubtedly have worked it out much\r\nmore fully, and in some respects more correctly than I did. I had\r\nmaterials for a whole chapter on the subject, and I ought to have made\r\nthe discussion longer; for it is clear that I failed to impress my\r\nreaders; and he who succeeds in doing so deserves, in my opinion, all\r\nthe credit.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to remark that I have almost always been treated honestly\r\nby my reviewers, passing over those without scientific knowledge as not\r\nworthy of notice. My views have often been grossly misrepresented,\r\nbitterly opposed and ridiculed, but this has been generally done, as I\r\nbelieve, in good faith. On the whole I do not doubt that my works have\r\nbeen over and over again greatly overpraised. I rejoice that I have\r\navoided controversies, and this I owe to Lyell, who many years ago, in\r\nreference to my geological works, strongly advised me never to get\r\nentangled in a controversy, as it rarely did any good and caused a\r\nmiserable loss of time and temper.\r\n\r\nWhenever I have found out that I have blundered, or that my work has\r\nbeen imperfect, and when I have been contemptuously criticised, and\r\neven when I have been overpraised, so that I have felt mortified, it\r\nhas been my greatest comfort to say hundreds of times to myself that “I\r\nhave worked as hard and as well as I could, and no man can do more than\r\nthis.” I remember when in Good Success Bay, in Tierra del Fuego,\r\nthinking (and, I believe, that I wrote home to the effect) that I could\r\nnot employ my life better than in adding a little to Natural Science.\r\nThis I have done to the best of my abilities, and critics may say what\r\nthey like, but they cannot destroy this conviction.\r\n\r\nDuring the two last months of 1859 I was fully occupied in preparing a\r\nsecond edition of the ‘Origin,’ and by an enormous correspondence. On\r\nJanuary 1st, 1860, I began arranging my notes for my work on the\r\n‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication;’ but it was not\r\npublished until the beginning of 1868; the delay having been caused\r\npartly by frequent illnesses, one of which lasted seven months, and\r\npartly by being tempted to publish on other subjects which at the time\r\ninterested me more.\r\n\r\nOn May 15th, 1862, my little book on the ‘Fertilisation of Orchids,’\r\nwhich cost me ten months’ work, was published: most of the facts had\r\nbeen slowly accumulated during several previous years. During the\r\nsummer of 1839, and, I believe, during the previous summer, I was led\r\nto attend to the cross-fertilisation of flowers by the aid of insects,\r\nfrom having come to the conclusion in my speculations on the origin of\r\nspecies, that crossing played an important part in keeping specific\r\nforms constant. I attended to the subject more or less during every\r\nsubsequent summer; and my interest in it was greatly enhanced by having\r\nprocured and read in November 1841, through the advice of Robert Brown,\r\na copy of C.K. Sprengel’s wonderful book, ‘Das entdeckte Geheimniss der\r\nNatur.’ For some years before 1862 I had specially attended to the\r\nfertilisation of our British orchids; and it seemed to me the best plan\r\nto prepare as complete a treatise on this group of plants as well as I\r\ncould, rather than to utilise the great mass of matter which I had\r\nslowly collected with respect to other plants.\r\n\r\nMy resolve proved a wise one; for since the appearance of my book, a\r\nsurprising number of papers and separate works on the fertilisation of\r\nall kinds of flowers have appeared: and these are far better done than\r\nI could possibly have effected. The merits of poor old Sprengel, so\r\nlong overlooked, are now fully recognised many years after his death.\r\n\r\nDuring the same year I published in the ‘Journal of the Linnean\r\nSociety’ a paper “On the Two Forms, or Dimorphic Condition of Primula,”\r\nand during the next five years, five other papers on dimorphic and\r\ntrimorphic plants. I do not think anything in my scientific life has\r\ngiven me so much satisfaction as making out the meaning of the\r\nstructure of these plants. I had noticed in 1838 or 1839 the dimorphism\r\nof Linum flavum, and had at first thought that it was merely a case of\r\nunmeaning variability. But on examining the common species of Primula I\r\nfound that the two forms were much too regular and constant to be thus\r\nviewed. I therefore became almost convinced that the common cowslip and\r\nprimrose were on the high road to become dioecious;—that the short\r\npistil in the one form, and the short stamens in the other form were\r\ntending towards abortion. The plants were therefore subjected under\r\nthis point of view to trial; but as soon as the flowers with short\r\npistils fertilised with pollen from the short stamens, were found to\r\nyield more seeds than any other of the four possible unions, the\r\nabortion-theory was knocked on the head. After some additional\r\nexperiment, it became evident that the two forms, though both were\r\nperfect hermaphrodites, bore almost the same relation to one another as\r\ndo the two sexes of an ordinary animal. With Lythrum we have the still\r\nmore wonderful case of three forms standing in a similar relation to\r\none another. I afterwards found that the offspring from the union of\r\ntwo plants belonging to the same forms presented a close and curious\r\nanalogy with hybrids from the union of two distinct species.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1864 I finished a long paper on ‘Climbing Plants,’ and\r\nsent it to the Linnean Society. The writing of this paper cost me four\r\nmonths; but I was so unwell when I received the proof-sheets that I was\r\nforced to leave them very badly and often obscurely expressed. The\r\npaper was little noticed, but when in 1875 it was corrected and\r\npublished as a separate book it sold well. I was led to take up this\r\nsubject by reading a short paper by Asa Gray, published in 1858. He\r\nsent me seeds, and on raising some plants I was so much fascinated and\r\nperplexed by the revolving movements of the tendrils and stems, which\r\nmovements are really very simple, though appearing at first sight very\r\ncomplex, that I procured various other kinds of climbing plants, and\r\nstudied the whole subject. I was all the more attracted to it, from not\r\nbeing at all satisfied with the explanation which Henslow gave us in\r\nhis lectures, about twining plants, namely, that they had a natural\r\ntendency to grow up in a spire. This explanation proved quite\r\nerroneous. Some of the adaptations displayed by Climbing Plants are as\r\nbeautiful as those of Orchids for ensuring cross-fertilisation.\r\n\r\nMy ‘Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication’ was begun, as\r\nalready stated, in the beginning of 1860, but was not published until\r\nthe beginning of 1868. It was a big book, and cost me four years and\r\ntwo months’ hard labour. It gives all my observations and an immense\r\nnumber of facts collected from various sources, about our domestic\r\nproductions. In the second volume the causes and laws of variation,\r\ninheritance, etc., are discussed as far as our present state of\r\nknowledge permits. Towards the end of the work I give my well-abused\r\nhypothesis of Pangenesis. An unverified hypothesis is of little or no\r\nvalue; but if anyone should hereafter be led to make observations by\r\nwhich some such hypothesis could be established, I shall have done good\r\nservice, as an astonishing number of isolated facts can be thus\r\nconnected together and rendered intelligible. In 1875 a second and\r\nlargely corrected edition, which cost me a good deal of labour, was\r\nbrought out.\r\n\r\nMy ‘Descent of Man’ was published in February, 1871. As soon as I had\r\nbecome, in the year 1837 or 1838, convinced that species were mutable\r\nproductions, I could not avoid the belief that man must come under the\r\nsame law. Accordingly I collected notes on the subject for my own\r\nsatisfaction, and not for a long time with any intention of publishing.\r\nAlthough in the ‘Origin of Species’ the derivation of any particular\r\nspecies is never discussed, yet I thought it best, in order that no\r\nhonourable man should accuse me of concealing my views, to add that by\r\nthe work “light would be thrown on the origin of man and his history.”\r\nIt would have been useless and injurious to the success of the book to\r\nhave paraded, without giving any evidence, my conviction with respect\r\nto his origin.\r\n\r\nBut when I found that many naturalists fully accepted the doctrine of\r\nthe evolution of species, it seemed to me advisable to work up such\r\nnotes as I possessed, and to publish a special treatise on the origin\r\nof man. I was the more glad to do so, as it gave me an opportunity of\r\nfully discussing sexual selection—a subject which had always greatly\r\ninterested me. This subject, and that of the variation of our domestic\r\nproductions, together with the causes and laws of variation,\r\ninheritance, and the intercrossing of plants, are the sole subjects\r\nwhich I have been able to write about in full, so as to use all the\r\nmaterials which I have collected. The ‘Descent of Man’ took me three\r\nyears to write, but then as usual some of this time was lost by ill\r\nhealth, and some was consumed by preparing new editions and other minor\r\nworks. A second and largely corrected edition of the ‘Descent’ appeared\r\nin 1874.\r\n\r\nMy book on the ‘Expression of the Emotions in Men and Animals’ was\r\npublished in the autumn of 1872. I had intended to give only a chapter\r\non the subject in the ‘Descent of Man,’ but as soon as I began to put\r\nmy notes together, I saw that it would require a separate treatise.\r\n\r\nMy first child was born on December 27th, 1839, and I at once commenced\r\nto make notes on the first dawn of the various expressions which he\r\nexhibited, for I felt convinced, even at this early period, that the\r\nmost complex and fine shades of expression must all have had a gradual\r\nand natural origin. During the summer of the following year, 1840, I\r\nread Sir C. Bell’s admirable work on expression, and this greatly\r\nincreased the interest which I felt in the subject, though I could not\r\nat all agree with his belief that various muscles had been specially\r\ncreated for the sake of expression. From this time forward I\r\noccasionally attended to the subject, both with respect to man and our\r\ndomesticated animals. My book sold largely; 5267 copies having been\r\ndisposed of on the day of publication.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1860 I was idling and resting near Hartfield, where\r\ntwo species of Drosera abound; and I noticed that numerous insects had\r\nbeen entrapped by the leaves. I carried home some plants, and on giving\r\nthem insects saw the movements of the tentacles, and this made me think\r\nit probable that the insects were caught for some special purpose.\r\nFortunately a crucial test occurred to me, that of placing a large\r\nnumber of leaves in various nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous fluids of\r\nequal density; and as soon as I found that the former alone excited\r\nenergetic movements, it was obvious that here was a fine new field for\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nDuring subsequent years, whenever I had leisure, I pursued my\r\nexperiments, and my book on ‘Insectivorous Plants’ was published in\r\nJuly 1875—that is, sixteen years after my first observations. The delay\r\nin this case, as with all my other books, has been a great advantage to\r\nme; for a man after a long interval can criticise his own work, almost\r\nas well as if it were that of another person. The fact that a plant\r\nshould secrete, when properly excited, a fluid containing an acid and\r\nferment, closely analogous to the digestive fluid of an animal, was\r\ncertainly a remarkable discovery.\r\n\r\nDuring this autumn of 1876 I shall publish on the ‘Effects of Cross and\r\nSelf-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom.’ This book will form a\r\ncomplement to that on the ‘Fertilisation of Orchids,’ in which I showed\r\nhow perfect were the means for cross-fertilisation, and here I shall\r\nshow how important are the results. I was led to make, during eleven\r\nyears, the numerous experiments recorded in this volume, by a mere\r\naccidental observation; and indeed it required the accident to be\r\nrepeated before my attention was thoroughly aroused to the remarkable\r\nfact that seedlings of self-fertilised parentage are inferior, even in\r\nthe first generation, in height and vigour to seedlings of\r\ncross-fertilised parentage. I hope also to republish a revised edition\r\nof my book on Orchids, and hereafter my papers on dimorphic and\r\ntrimorphic plants, together with some additional observations on allied\r\npoints which I never have had time to arrange. My strength will then\r\nprobably be exhausted, and I shall be ready to exclaim “Nunc dimittis.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWRITTEN MAY 1ST, 1881.\r\n\r\n\r\n‘The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation’ was published in the\r\nautumn of 1876; and the results there arrived at explain, as I believe,\r\nthe endless and wonderful contrivances for the transportal of pollen\r\nfrom one plant to another of the same species. I now believe, however,\r\nchiefly from the observations of Hermann Muller, that I ought to have\r\ninsisted more strongly than I did on the many adaptations for\r\nself-fertilisation; though I was well aware of many such adaptations. A\r\nmuch enlarged edition of my ‘Fertilisation of Orchids’ was published in\r\n1877.\r\n\r\nIn this same year ‘The Different Forms of Flowers, etc.,’ appeared, and\r\nin 1880 a second edition. This book consists chiefly of the several\r\npapers on Heterostyled flowers originally published by the Linnean\r\nSociety, corrected, with much new matter added, together with\r\nobservations on some other cases in which the same plant bears two\r\nkinds of flowers. As before remarked, no little discovery of mine ever\r\ngave me so much pleasure as the making out the meaning of heterostyled\r\nflowers. The results of crossing such flowers in an illegitimate\r\nmanner, I believe to be very important, as bearing on the sterility of\r\nhybrids; although these results have been noticed by only a few\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, I had a translation of Dr. Ernst Krause’s ‘Life of Erasmus\r\nDarwin’ published, and I added a sketch of his character and habits\r\nfrom material in my possession. Many persons have been much interested\r\nby this little life, and I am surprised that only 800 or 900 copies\r\nwere sold.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 I published, with [my son] Frank’s assistance, our ‘Power of\r\nMovement in Plants.’ This was a tough piece of work. The book bears\r\nsomewhat the same relation to my little book on ‘Climbing Plants,’\r\nwhich ‘Cross-Fertilisation’ did to the ‘Fertilisation of Orchids;’ for\r\nin accordance with the principle of evolution it was impossible to\r\naccount for climbing plants having been developed in so many widely\r\ndifferent groups unless all kinds of plants possess some slight power\r\nof movement of an analogous kind. This I proved to be the case; and I\r\nwas further led to a rather wide generalisation, viz. that the great\r\nand important classes of movements, excited by light, the attraction of\r\ngravity, etc., are all modified forms of the fundamental movement of\r\ncircumnutation. It has always pleased me to exalt plants in the scale\r\nof organised beings; and I therefore felt an especial pleasure in\r\nshowing how many and what admirably well adapted movements the tip of a\r\nroot possesses.\r\n\r\nI have now (May 1, 1881) sent to the printers the MS. of a little book\r\non ‘The Formation of Vegetable Mould, through the Action of Worms.’\r\nThis is a subject of but small importance; and I know not whether it\r\nwill interest any readers (Between November 1881 and February 1884,\r\n8500 copies have been sold.), but it has interested me. It is the\r\ncompletion of a short paper read before the Geological Society more\r\nthan forty years ago, and has revived old geological thoughts.\r\n\r\nI have now mentioned all the books which I have published, and these\r\nhave been the milestones in my life, so that little remains to be said.\r\nI am not conscious of any change in my mind during the last thirty\r\nyears, excepting in one point presently to be mentioned; nor, indeed,\r\ncould any change have been expected unless one of general\r\ndeterioration. But my father lived to his eighty-third year with his\r\nmind as lively as ever it was, and all his faculties undimmed; and I\r\nhope that I may die before my mind fails to a sensible extent. I think\r\nthat I have become a little more skilful in guessing right explanations\r\nand in devising experimental tests; but this may probably be the result\r\nof mere practice, and of a larger store of knowledge. I have as much\r\ndifficulty as ever in expressing myself clearly and concisely; and this\r\ndifficulty has caused me a very great loss of time; but it has had the\r\ncompensating advantage of forcing me to think long and intently about\r\nevery sentence, and thus I have been led to see errors in reasoning and\r\nin my own observations or those of others.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be a sort of fatality in my mind leading me to put at\r\nfirst my statement or proposition in a wrong or awkward form. Formerly\r\nI used to think about my sentences before writing them down; but for\r\nseveral years I have found that it saves time to scribble in a vile\r\nhand whole pages as quickly as I possibly can, contracting half the\r\nwords; and then correct deliberately. Sentences thus scribbled down are\r\noften better ones than I could have written deliberately.\r\n\r\nHaving said thus much about my manner of writing, I will add that with\r\nmy large books I spend a good deal of time over the general arrangement\r\nof the matter. I first make the rudest outline in two or three pages,\r\nand then a larger one in several pages, a few words or one word\r\nstanding for a whole discussion or series of facts. Each one of these\r\nheadings is again enlarged and often transferred before I begin to\r\nwrite in extenso. As in several of my books facts observed by others\r\nhave been very extensively used, and as I have always had several quite\r\ndistinct subjects in hand at the same time, I may mention that I keep\r\nfrom thirty to forty large portfolios, in cabinets with labelled\r\nshelves, into which I can at once put a detached reference or\r\nmemorandum. I have bought many books, and at their ends I make an index\r\nof all the facts that concern my work; or, if the book is not my own,\r\nwrite out a separate abstract, and of such abstracts I have a large\r\ndrawer full. Before beginning on any subject I look to all the short\r\nindexes and make a general and classified index, and by taking the one\r\nor more proper portfolios I have all the information collected during\r\nmy life ready for use.\r\n\r\nI have said that in one respect my mind has changed during the last\r\ntwenty or thirty years. Up to the age of thirty, or beyond it, poetry\r\nof many kinds, such as the works of Milton, Gray, Byron, Wordsworth,\r\nColeridge, and Shelley, gave me great pleasure, and even as a schoolboy\r\nI took intense delight in Shakespeare, especially in the historical\r\nplays. I have also said that formerly pictures gave me considerable,\r\nand music very great delight. But now for many years I cannot endure to\r\nread a line of poetry: I have tried lately to read Shakespeare, and\r\nfound it so intolerably dull that it nauseated me. I have also almost\r\nlost my taste for pictures or music. Music generally sets me thinking\r\ntoo energetically on what I have been at work on, instead of giving me\r\npleasure. I retain some taste for fine scenery, but it does not cause\r\nme the exquisite delight which it formerly did. On the other hand,\r\nnovels which are works of the imagination, though not of a very high\r\norder, have been for years a wonderful relief and pleasure to me, and I\r\noften bless all novelists. A surprising number have been read aloud to\r\nme, and I like all if moderately good, and if they do not end\r\nunhappily—against which a law ought to be passed. A novel, according to\r\nmy taste, does not come into the first class unless it contains some\r\nperson whom one can thoroughly love, and if a pretty woman all the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThis curious and lamentable loss of the higher aesthetic tastes is all\r\nthe odder, as books on history, biographies, and travels (independently\r\nof any scientific facts which they may contain), and essays on all\r\nsorts of subjects interest me as much as ever they did. My mind seems\r\nto have become a kind of machine for grinding general laws out of large\r\ncollections of facts, but why this should have caused the atrophy of\r\nthat part of the brain alone, on which the higher tastes depend, I\r\ncannot conceive. A man with a mind more highly organised or better\r\nconstituted than mine, would not, I suppose, have thus suffered; and if\r\nI had to live my life again, I would have made a rule to read some\r\npoetry and listen to some music at least once every week; for perhaps\r\nthe parts of my brain now atrophied would thus have been kept active\r\nthrough use. The loss of these tastes is a loss of happiness, and may\r\npossibly be injurious to the intellect, and more probably to the moral\r\ncharacter, by enfeebling the emotional part of our nature.\r\n\r\nMy books have sold largely in England, have been translated into many\r\nlanguages, and passed through several editions in foreign countries. I\r\nhave heard it said that the success of a work abroad is the best test\r\nof its enduring value. I doubt whether this is at all trustworthy; but\r\njudged by this standard my name ought to last for a few years.\r\nTherefore it may be worth while to try to analyse the mental qualities\r\nand the conditions on which my success has depended; though I am aware\r\nthat no man can do this correctly.\r\n\r\nI have no great quickness of apprehension or wit which is so remarkable\r\nin some clever men, for instance, Huxley. I am therefore a poor critic:\r\na paper or book, when first read, generally excites my admiration, and\r\nit is only after considerable reflection that I perceive the weak\r\npoints. My power to follow a long and purely abstract train of thought\r\nis very limited; and therefore I could never have succeeded with\r\nmetaphysics or mathematics. My memory is extensive, yet hazy: it\r\nsuffices to make me cautious by vaguely telling me that I have observed\r\nor read something opposed to the conclusion which I am drawing, or on\r\nthe other hand in favour of it; and after a time I can generally\r\nrecollect where to search for my authority. So poor in one sense is my\r\nmemory, that I have never been able to remember for more than a few\r\ndays a single date or a line of poetry.\r\n\r\nSome of my critics have said, “Oh, he is a good observer, but he has no\r\npower of reasoning!” I do not think that this can be true, for the\r\n‘Origin of Species’ is one long argument from the beginning to the end,\r\nand it has convinced not a few able men. No one could have written it\r\nwithout having some power of reasoning. I have a fair share of\r\ninvention, and of common sense or judgment, such as every fairly\r\nsuccessful lawyer or doctor must have, but not, I believe, in any\r\nhigher degree.\r\n\r\nOn the favourable side of the balance, I think that I am superior to\r\nthe common run of men in noticing things which easily escape attention,\r\nand in observing them carefully. My industry has been nearly as great\r\nas it could have been in the observation and collection of facts. What\r\nis far more important, my love of natural science has been steady and\r\nardent.\r\n\r\nThis pure love has, however, been much aided by the ambition to be\r\nesteemed by my fellow naturalists. From my early youth I have had the\r\nstrongest desire to understand or explain whatever I observed,—that is,\r\nto group all facts under some general laws. These causes combined have\r\ngiven me the patience to reflect or ponder for any number of years over\r\nany unexplained problem. As far as I can judge, I am not apt to follow\r\nblindly the lead of other men. I have steadily endeavoured to keep my\r\nmind free so as to give up any hypothesis, however much beloved (and I\r\ncannot resist forming one on every subject), as soon as facts are shown\r\nto be opposed to it. Indeed, I have had no choice but to act in this\r\nmanner, for with the exception of the Coral Reefs, I cannot remember a\r\nsingle first-formed hypothesis which had not after a time to be given\r\nup or greatly modified. This has naturally led me to distrust greatly\r\ndeductive reasoning in the mixed sciences. On the other hand, I am not\r\nvery sceptical,—a frame of mind which I believe to be injurious to the\r\nprogress of science. A good deal of scepticism in a scientific man is\r\nadvisable to avoid much loss of time, but I have met with not a few\r\nmen, who, I feel sure, have often thus been deterred from experiment or\r\nobservations, which would have proved directly or indirectly\r\nserviceable.\r\n\r\nIn illustration, I will give the oddest case which I have known. A\r\ngentleman (who, as I afterwards heard, is a good local botanist) wrote\r\nto me from the Eastern counties that the seed or beans of the common\r\nfield-bean had this year everywhere grown on the wrong side of the pod.\r\nI wrote back, asking for further information, as I did not understand\r\nwhat was meant; but I did not receive any answer for a very long time.\r\nI then saw in two newspapers, one published in Kent and the other in\r\nYorkshire, paragraphs stating that it was a most remarkable fact that\r\n“the beans this year had all grown on the wrong side.” So I thought\r\nthere must be some foundation for so general a statement. Accordingly,\r\nI went to my gardener, an old Kentish man, and asked him whether he had\r\nheard anything about it, and he answered, “Oh, no, sir, it must be a\r\nmistake, for the beans grow on the wrong side only on leap-year, and\r\nthis is not leap-year.” I then asked him how they grew in common years\r\nand how on leap-years, but soon found that he knew absolutely nothing\r\nof how they grew at any time, but he stuck to his belief.\r\n\r\nAfter a time I heard from my first informant, who, with many apologies,\r\nsaid that he should not have written to me had he not heard the\r\nstatement from several intelligent farmers; but that he had since\r\nspoken again to every one of them, and not one knew in the least what\r\nhe had himself meant. So that here a belief—if indeed a statement with\r\nno definite idea attached to it can be called a belief—had spread over\r\nalmost the whole of England without any vestige of evidence.\r\n\r\nI have known in the course of my life only three intentionally\r\nfalsified statements, and one of these may have been a hoax (and there\r\nhave been several scientific hoaxes) which, however, took in an\r\nAmerican Agricultural Journal. It related to the formation in Holland\r\nof a new breed of oxen by the crossing of distinct species of Bos (some\r\nof which I happen to know are sterile together), and the author had the\r\nimpudence to state that he had corresponded with me, and that I had\r\nbeen deeply impressed with the importance of his result. The article\r\nwas sent to me by the editor of an English Agricultural Journal, asking\r\nfor my opinion before republishing it.\r\n\r\nA second case was an account of several varieties, raised by the author\r\nfrom several species of Primula, which had spontaneously yielded a full\r\ncomplement of seed, although the parent plants had been carefully\r\nprotected from the access of insects. This account was published before\r\nI had discovered the meaning of heterostylism, and the whole statement\r\nmust have been fraudulent, or there was neglect in excluding insects so\r\ngross as to be scarcely credible.\r\n\r\nThe third case was more curious: Mr. Huth published in his book on\r\n‘Consanguineous Marriage’ some long extracts from a Belgian author, who\r\nstated that he had interbred rabbits in the closest manner for very\r\nmany generations, without the least injurious effects. The account was\r\npublished in a most respectable Journal, that of the Royal Society of\r\nBelgium; but I could not avoid feeling doubts—I hardly know why, except\r\nthat there were no accidents of any kind, and my experience in breeding\r\nanimals made me think this very improbable.\r\n\r\nSo with much hesitation I wrote to Professor Van Beneden, asking him\r\nwhether the author was a trustworthy man. I soon heard in answer that\r\nthe Society had been greatly shocked by discovering that the whole\r\naccount was a fraud. (The falseness of the published statements on\r\nwhich Mr. Huth relied has been pointed out by himself in a slip\r\ninserted in all the copies of his book which then remained unsold.) The\r\nwriter had been publicly challenged in the Journal to say where he had\r\nresided and kept his large stock of rabbits while carrying on his\r\nexperiments, which must have consumed several years, and no answer\r\ncould be extracted from him.\r\n\r\nMy habits are methodical, and this has been of not a little use for my\r\nparticular line of work. Lastly, I have had ample leisure from not\r\nhaving to earn my own bread. Even ill-health, though it has annihilated\r\nseveral years of my life, has saved me from the distractions of society\r\nand amusement.\r\n\r\nTherefore my success as a man of science, whatever this may have\r\namounted to, has been determined, as far as I can judge, by complex and\r\ndiversified mental qualities and conditions. Of these, the most\r\nimportant have been—the love of science—unbounded patience in long\r\nreflecting over any subject—industry in observing and collecting\r\nfacts—and a fair share of invention as well as of common sense. With\r\nsuch moderate abilities as I possess, it is truly surprising that I\r\nshould have influenced to a considerable extent the belief of\r\nscientific men on some important points.",
